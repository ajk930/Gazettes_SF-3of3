NEW TOR^, Nov. 17.â "With the end of the" morning ses
sion to-day Senator Armstrong's committee oh Insurance in
vestigation finished a week's service which has not been
eclipsed since the investigation was inaugurated. The wit
nesses have been the most important, including the "big
guns" in the financial world, as well as In the insurance bus
iness. Early in the week James H. Hyde was examined
and made charges against E. H. Harriman and former Gov
ernor Odell, who successively appeared and denied Hyde's
etatements, and Hyde, being recalled, affirmed his- testimony.
Senator Chauncey M. Depew was heard, and when the ses
sion opened to-day it was expected that before the day was
over Senator Platt would be called. He is wanted to testify
as to the collection of contributions to political funds by the
insurance companies, Odell having testified yesterday that
â¢ Senator Platt collected all such moneys up to Jast year. It
is now expected that the Senator will be heard early next
week, possibly on Tuesday, when the sessions will be re
sumed.
Samuel S.- McCurdy, assistant register of the Equitable
and not related to the McCurdys of the Mutual Life, said he
had charge of the vouchers for legal service. From him was'
gleaned a story of trouble in California in 1537, when the In
surance Commissioners of that State demanded an Investiga
tion. Thousands of dollars were spent by the Equitable in
this matter, as recounted by McCurdy, and he justified the
expenditure on the ground that it would have cost the Equit
able about $40,000 had no defense been made, hence the ex
penditure for counsel. He seemed to think the demands of the
California Commissioners were exorbitant.
je.vatou nnruws mkmory is poor.
Senator Depew was called to give any information he
might possess as to a number of vouchers for legal services,
but his knowledge In the matter was rather limited, and
many of the" expenditures and signers of these vouchers he
had never heard of.
One voucher to 'John A. Nichols for legal services was ac
companied by a letter to Senator Depew referring to "our
friend who comes around once a year," and "your, rambunc
tious friend up the river." The Senator said he knew Nichols
had been retained at different times by the Equitable, but he
did not know in what connection. Nichols, he said, I was once
Quarantine Commissioner, and used to be active in: politics.
Gage E. Tarbell was on the stand when adjournment until
Tuesday was taken.
Frank B. Jordan, son of the former Comptroller of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society, was the first witness
called to-day. He bad testified at a previous session that he
did not know the whereabouts of his father or mother and
that be did not know whether they were living or dead. To
day he cald heÂ«had not since learned of his father's where
about*. He had received a letter from his mother, who is in
Canada. She said nothing about his father, as to his profits
from fire Insurance written on properties mortgaged to the
Equitable, he said his father received none of them. He bad
no idea what proportion of his business the Equitable fur
nished him.
UcCURDV IXVOLVKS CALIFORXIAXS IS SCAXDAL.
Samuel S. McCurdy. assistant registrar of the Equitable
Society, was next called. He had formerly been secretary to
Secretary William Alexander of _ the society. As assistant
registrar he had custody of vouchers for money paid out for
legal expenses. .He produced the vouchers for such expenses
for the last ten years. On the vouchers for 1595 was a let
ter to James W. Alexander from Robert H. McCurdy of
the Mutual Life Insurance Company,- which accompanied a
bill for the Equitable's share of salary and expenses of George
S. Batcheller as "plenary, legal representatlve'"of the Equit
able Society, New York Life Company and Mutual. Life In
surance Company. The salary of Batcheller from this
bination was given in a statement as $77,700. It was brought
out that Batcheller*s duties were, abroad.
. The packages of vouchers fbr payment for legal , services
In various State Le gislatures were . gone through by . Attor
ney Hughes, who asked as to the legal services rendered by
the signers of the various ' vouchers.
A voucher from James M. Lewis, dated January, 27, 1899^
was for $1000, 'In full for services rendered during the com
ing session of. the General Assembly in Missouri." Witness
did not know Lewis or the services he performed, nor did
he shed much light on other vouchers.
McCurdy said that $250 a month" had been paid to special
counsel to represent the Eaultable Society " before the com
mission appointed by Insurance Commissioner of -California
Clunie in 1900, demanding that the society make a list of its
outstanding polices, at the ' suggestion of.E. S. Pillsbury, ; the
society's regular attorney, who i had l - told the witness >It was
paid to a brother of the Insurance Commissioner, The total
amount paid in that way was $9000.' The witness said also
that approximately $17,500 was paid to' W. H.'t Chickerlnjr of
California, counsel for the ' Mutual Life , Insurance Company.

At the close of 3899, when the Equitable Society 'filed its

ARE OUT OF CITY
BUDD TALKS OF CASE
Says That Mis::W^k
the Equitable W as in 4
Legal Capacity.
The press dispatches containing "the statements' of wit
nesses, before. the New York legislative' commission that
is probing the affairs of the large Insurance companies
caused much discussion in \u25a0 business and professional
circles yesterday as the names of prominent Calif ornians
are involved in the far-reaching scandal. /
By a curious coincidence, the men named in the dis
patches, with one exception, are all out. of the. city and
their business associates have .only a general idea of
their whereabouts. . An, attempt to locate former Commis
sioner. Clunie yesterday resulted in the Information that
he had been out of v town for a week and was in Los
Angeles. His office was closed and persistent \u25a0 calls at
his residence failed to brine an answer. Word was re
ceived late last night that Clunie is on his way home and
will arrive, here this. afternoon. .
Another attorney prominently, featured- in the New
York' investigation is W. H. Chickerlng. Inquiry at Chick
ering's office revealed the fact that "he; had left there half
an hour.ago" for Los Gatos and would not return for sev
eral days. He could not be found at Los Gatos last night.
E. S. Pillsbury who is mentioned" as having â¢advised the
Equitable to pay General Thomas J.. Clunie^ , brother of
former Commisser Clunie, $250 a ; month, was not. to be
seen at his offlice yesterday afternoon and. inquiry at the
Palace, where he resides, revealed the fact that he also
is out of town.
OLD RUMORS OF SCANDAL ARE RKVIVED. '
When the first investigation, of , the t insurance' com
panies began Mr. Pillsbury" was mentionel as | an' attorney
of the Equitable and in a former interview said that he
had simply been retained by the, insurance company to use
every legal means to have the State tax reduced and: that
after succeeding in doing this -his connection . with the
insurance company ceased. . \u25a0â¢ . :,.-,..
The revival of the old rumors "'of' scandal recalls the
career of former Insurance Commissioner J.N.E.* Wilson,"
who was shot and killed â¢ by his client, James Clancy; five
years ago. Wilson was unfortunate in the conduct. of his
office and narrowly escaped charges :of | embezzlement of
money he had collected from' insurance companies and
deposited in a local bank instead of turning over to the
State. '\u0084/:-; - - . '.:.: v ' . â\u25a0\u25a0-
, When ."Wilson was made Insurance .Commissioner;. he
had as partner .Eugene Bert,; an '- attorney "and " baseball
magnate, and when^Wilson^iras , appointed Bert ;' became
the Insurance Commissioner's /official? attorney.. Bert is
the livelongr-frlendof Andrew iJ.Clunie, -who* was. ;ap-
pointed by Governor Budd to . succeed Wilson as ; Insurance
Commissioner, but : during;; Clunie's " 'administration' . : his
brother. General Thomas J. Cluhie. (now/dead), -acted as
legal adviser of the Commissioner.; > General ;Clunie:> owned
the building in whicm the Insurance Commissioner's; office
was situated and ; Bert had i his . offices : next I, door. At Â£ the
conclusion of Governor^ Budd* s ;*tidmiriistration,>Budd"lwas
appointed special attorney for ; the r insurance companies
and in that capacity made two visits to New ; York in 1900
and 1901.. V v ' r, :

tigation in New. York," ex-Governor Biidd said last night:^'

that the army In Manchuria had re
volted.
At tiie meeting: of the council, which
was hold In the same hall wlicrc Father
Capon. Maxim Gorky and other leaders
denounced the Kmperor on ihe evening
of January 22 Â«."Red Sunday"), delegate
after delegate from different factories
arose and reported that the workmen,
under the influence of the ultimatum
issued by thy employers, announcing
that the factories would- be shut down
Indefinitely unless work was resumed
on Mondaj-. ami with the pleading's Of
their wives and of the conservative
\u25a0svorkmen rinsing In their ears, were
Oemanding that the strike should be
*>n<led.
This precipitated a hotly contested de
bate. The moderates declared that the
strike in the first instance was a strategi
cal mistake and that It would be a graver
error to attempt to force the men to re
main in line.- One fiery speaker, who in
order to be better seen and heard, mount
ed the balcony from which Father Gapon
in disguise had delivered his last address
In that hall, ' thundered his denunciation
of those who wished to discontinue the
struggle.
"Even If we cannot continue the strike
until the purposes for which it was called
are attained," he said, "let us not aban
don it without inflicting a real blow on
the Government. A three-day strike Is a
mere pin prick in the hides of the crafty
fox. v\ me, . and his; followers, so let us
keÂ«p it up for a fortnight. -Tfae^ men in
ojher factories of St. Petersburg arÂ». daily
joining us; our delegates are closing' Sc
pharmacies and the railroad.tle-up Is com
plete. What a figure we %rill cut in the
of our brothers outside of St. Peters
burg if, before tney have had the op
portunity of aoting on our appeal, they
hear that we have laid down our arms."
After a long discussion, a motion to call
off the strike was rejected and it was de
cided to call meetings of workmen in tfxe
factories to-day for the purpose of laying
the situation before them and to abide by
their decision.
PLAY FINAL STROKE.
The leaders, however, were determined
rot to permit the strike to die without
a final great demonstration of their power
to render St. Petersburg a "dead city."
After the adoption of the resolution call-
Ing for a referendum, it was decided to
bend every effcrt to close every store,
market and office, beginning at 11 o'clock
this morning, and to stop all street car
and carriage traffic in the streets so as to
bring the life of the Russian capital to
a complete standstill. The stoppage of
the electric plants, which the Govern
ment had succeeded in getting In partial
operation, was entrusted, to electrical
workers in the various districts, who
were empowered to use any and all means
deemed advisable for the injuring of the
machinery and the short circuiting of the
dynamos, even to the extent of destroy
ing the plants.
Another resolution called for the release
of the four delegates who had been ar
rested. It was decided to mass 8000 men
in front of each prison where the dele-
Kates are detained and to hold them there
until the prisoners are liberated.
The Prefect of Police has published an
appeal to the well-disposed classes, warn
ing them that the strike leaders intend to
take aggressive action to-day and asking
them to co-operate with the police
â¢gainst the agitators "who are making
life unbearable."
In the meetinff the advocates of the
strike laid stress on encouraging news
from |he, interior 'which they said they

kmen to-day, but last night's dispatches

It 6eÂ«me<l almost incredible to the lady
â¢ â¢who writes from Clinton vllle. Conn;, that
.coffee caused the physical ailments .from
which she had so long suffered. \u25a0
In such cases the real cause Is often
the one least suspected, and. one is loth
to --believe that the mask of friendship
has hidden the lace" of a relentless foe. '
"I had suffered much for. years from
nervous troubles which finally so af-
fected me (hat my whole system was run
down. I crew pale and emaciated and
had to practically give up domestic du-
ties. The doctor did his best with me,

menced. I shall always remember the

\u25a0 not only myself but my friends as well,

Bead the little book, "The Road to

showed little confirmatory evidence of
such news. \
A strike has broken out in the section
of the Southwestern Railroad between
Tsaritsln ' and Varonesch in the lower
Volga region, but the demands for shorter
hours and higher pay are economic and
have no connection with the political
aims of the St. Petersburg strikers.
The news from Moscow is even less
encouraging. The railroads are still run
ning and the telegraphers have flatly re
fused to consider a strike for the political
aims of the Poles, whose endangered lib
erties form the ostensible cause of the
strike in St. Petersburg. Wo.rk is being
resumed in -Moscow and I ' the news- from
other sections shows that the call of the
St Petersburg committee has awakened
little sympathy.
APPEAL, TO THE MILITARY.
The workmen's organization to-day ad
dressed the following appeal to the sol
diers and sailors: ;
''Comrades and Brothers: For a long
time we have- misunderstood each other.
Your officers taught you to regard us" as
enemies of the fatherland and as crim
inals whom you should shoot, beat with
your- whips and butcher with your baÂ»
onets.
"Our 'struggle for the people's freedom
and the people's well-being has been de
picted to you as a revolution against the
fatherland which you are obliged to sup
press. Many of you, believing this, have
shot your own brothers, filled the streets
of our towns with blood. ' ',' ' .
."The ( .case is now altered. The eyes
oU many.of the soldiers and sailors have
beeh' opened. They understand that all
of us are brothers and that we are sons
of the same nation, whose common en
emies are your commanders and those In
power. . They understand that the liberty
of the people is their own liberty and the
good of the people their own good.
"The men of the- Baltic Sea, at Kron
stadt, stood against their commanders
and signified that they wanted to lead
the lives of men; that they wanted lib
erty, and they associated themselves with
the cause of the people. A hundred sail
ors at Kronstadt have been handed over
to a court-martial and to-day or to-mor
row may be! executed. Knowing this, we
workmen of St. Petersburg struck, de
manding: yie release of our soldier., and
sailor brothers and the abolition of courts
martial and the death penalty. .
"la. it possible that you, soldiers and
sailors, will not arise and help your ..broth-,
ers at Kronstadt? Is it possible that you
will remain hand in hand with the mur
derers of our brothers, at Kronstadt? \ We
workmen say: 'The cause of the soldier
and the^ sailor is our cause' and bo we
have gone out on strike; You . must say.
everywhere 'the cause 6f. : the workmen is
our cause and the struggle" of the work
men our struggle," and you must asso-;
date yourselves with the struggling peo
ple. You must strike' and refuse to per
form the duties imposed on you. â¢' Don't
listen to the, word of command calling
upon you to put down -the workmen's
movement. Let not one shot be fired by
you against the people. .. \u25a0 \u0084
"Down with your bloodthirsty com
manders. Long live a free government
and a free people."

Another demand which, ) the said, -Clunie made
was that a complete set'of 'the- Equitable "- Society's 'books

would have cost the society about- $75,000... He -also; said
that under the" law: of California the -Commissioner could

General Dedulin. Prefect . of . Police,
issued a 1"a 1 " proclamation to-day,*"' catling
upon the inhabitants not to yield to the
demands of. the strikers for the cessa
tion, from .work, which- demands, it Is
pointed out, are sometimes accom
| panied by theats. The \u25a0 proclamation
! announces that all \ measures will be
taken for the repression of violence. -
In some quarters the belief %is ex
pressed that martial law will be pro
claimed "in St. Petersburg to-morrow.
It is said- that the Emperor and Grand
Dukes insist on this step, against the
counsels "of Count de Witte. ;
The employers during the day finally
informed the workmen that they had
decided against an eight-hour day.
There was an unprecedented run on the
savings banks to-day. Some of them were
unable \u25a0 to, meet the demand Immediately.
The utterly reckless spirit manifested
by the Vreds," who engineered the pres
ent strike, is' producing a natural revul

and public tranquillity. Many o.f the Lib
erals, who fought the Government active

their leaders blundered , frightfully by re
fusing to lend their support to Count
Witte in his difficult task because he
had declined to accept the' unqualified
conditions laid down by them. They see
now that it is too late; that they missed
the : great opportunity of becoming the

the settlement of questions still pending
with Canada. He has been in conference
with John W. Foster, former member of
the American-Canadian High Joint Com

various interests which will be benefited
by the removal of all friction in the rela
tions between the United States and the
Dominion. He has carefully considered
the proceedings of the High Joint Com
mission, which failed to reach an agree
ment on account of the . Alaskan boun
dary dispute and the question of recipro
city, and Is satisfied, that, with the Alas
kan boundary matter disposed of, there
is no obstacle too great to be overcome
if approached in a spirit of good will
on both sides.
The questions to be settled with Canada
and Newfoundland in the order of their
importance include:
Tariff relations, fisheries, armament to
be maintained on the great lakes, tran
sit of merchandise in bond, alien labor
laws, mining rights, conveyance of crim
inals, wreckage and salvage.

CASTRO MUST

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 17.â President
Roosevelt ' and Secretary - Root 'are now
making elaborate preparations to bring
up Venezuela and President Castro with
a sharp turn. The administration is
tired of the actions of Castro, who has
not only confiscated the property, of
American citizens but of the subjects of
foreign powers. He has put this .Gov
ernment to an enormous expense and
trouble In enforcing the Monroe doctrine
and In keeping foreign powers out of the
western hemisphere.
For some days Secretary Root has been
at work preparing an exhaustive report
on the actions of Castro, which will -be
submitted to Congress during the early
part of the session. No conclusion has
been reached* as to what action will be
taken, but the Secretary of State has
concluded that the time has come to put
an end to the condition of affairs in Ven
ezuela, so far as this Government Is con
cerned.

JUDGE TOO EASY
SAYS HITCHCOCK
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Nov.! 17.â Secretary âHitch
cock's severe criticism of the. leniency
displayed by Judge ' Munger, < imposing a
small fine as sentence on Bartlett Rich
ards and W. G. Comstock, the wealthy
cattle barons, who pleaded guilty to the
illegal fencing of 200,000 acres of Govern
ment lands, ' has caused [ a decidedly un
easy feeling among Federal officials here.
Secretary Hitchcock is quoted as saying:
"I am surprised and Indignant at that
sentence. The punishment is entirely in
adequate." ; , - criticism is considered
particularly severe because it is thought
that. It comes direct -from President
Roosevelt. . ' - â¢
Judge, Munger, who passed sentence on
the cattle barons, Is outspoken in his ceni
sure of the Secretary's criticism. He said
â¢to-day:: â¢' \u25a0 :.*-_\ ~ .'\u25a0 .. l ~ *>'.'.
"One would think the Secretary had
enough to do to; look after the affairs per
taining to his, office without ; seeking ., to
saddle himself with additional 1 responsi
bilities.;" I think the X result , which;' the
movement hoped , to* attain | has been ef
fected. - The inclosing of the r Government
domain is not a crime per' ael ' It is noth
ing .: more than : a" statuory offense. The
fact that the Government had spent four
years of determined efforts; and\thou
sands . of I dollars * before " the defendants
were indicted was 'not a matter sub
mitted for my consideration."

Saf' what, you will' aboutdancing:. be
ing passe, the ball- is still .the roseate
dream of -youth, where love and \u25a0beauty
revel in''the cool of the palms, ; like the
fairies of Fontainebleau. . :-'â¢ . ,
It is the expression of youthful en
ergy translated into funâ -sweet,, clean
funâ and the fresher the youth : the
keener the fun. .
? Â£.ast night's ball at the' Palace, the
first-dance of the winter'Jof> the Friday
Night. Club, was a joyâ a" veritable joy;
for,* like the famous Charleston cotil
lons of ye olden * day, the - exuberance
of* the debutante was merged" with' the
happy, . reminiscent . grandmamma. C ". ; ,
' 'A smashing' lot of 'debutantes they
wereâthese little maids from -school;
and seemingly immensely- popular, with
the gallant, cavalry officers 1 who glad
dened tlie hour wi\h the'gleam of their
braid and brass. <~
here is a' social â¢- ' feature for
which San Francisco should thank the
godsâ the war godsâ this proximity to
so many army and naval :stations.-
It puts a lot of men in circulationâ
as . witness the ball last "night. \u25a0 And
since the success .ol' a ball dependsâ
not so much upon the women as upon
the ; men, smart dances, in town ; fare
.well, and there are usually men- to"
spare. And this is the elysium of the
debutante â a lot of nice'men to dance
with. The belle? She,, too, is an ad
vocate of an overstocked \u25a0: market of
men, but the lack of them: doesn't hurt
her as it would the debutante, whose
success ia measured by the | attention
she gets from eligible ,men:> :
i That there is room for ,.a- third dan

The . case was â¢ appealed by the State

BRITISH HELP
FOR THE ORDS
â¢ NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â That .the
British legation at Washington pala
; the" 1 tuition at Georgetown of James
; Ord, the reputed" son of King George
IV by his lawful wife. Mrs. FlU
herbert; that British officers visited
.Georgetown* University, where he was>
trained, and that the original Ord bore
a striking resemblance to the English
King, is ; the gist of a statement made
yesterday byÂ»Rev. John Fox. S. J., pres
ident of St. Peter's College, Jersey City.
Father Fox was at Georgetown Uni
versity for many years and was in
timately acquainted with the Jesuit
astronomer, Father Curley. who knew
James Ord. Father .Fox said:
"Father Curley. died at the age of 94
years., I recall distinctly his speaking
of the Ord mystery, on the lineage. of
a .young student whom he knew as a
boy at the university. He told me that
In those days, the latter part of the
eighteenth century, young Ord was
spoken of as one of royal birth. Father
Curley told me particularly that the
bills contracted by young Otd were met
by the British. legation and that in his
time British officers frequently, visited
the â¢ institution to inquire for young
Ord. The two eldest sons of this Obrd
attended Georgetown University when
Father Curley was stationed there a3
a priest.
"I met James Ord in ISS9. Idid not
broach the subject, but when he gave
me his name I recalled Father Curley*s
story. Although bent with age. there
was a kingly. bearing about him."
James L. Ord, the Western Union Tel
egraph superintendent, in Chicago, Is a
direct descendant of the original Ord
and believes himself the legitimate
grandson or King George IV and the
legitimate heir to the estate of Mrs.
Fitzherbert. said to be worth $5,009,000.

FLEET-FOOTED ELKS RESIST ATTEMPTS
TO FORCE THEM INTO CAPTIVITY.
Wild Band Keeps
Special Dlapatcli to ThÂ« CalL
BAKERSFIELD, Xov. 17. â Scenes
that man never. again jnay -witness in
the Western Hemisphere are now be
ing enacted on the great mesa along
the Coast Range, where, the only sur
viving elk outside of narks :in the
United States, the remnant of the great
bands of the antlered herd that once
roamed the Western plains by thou
sands, are being temporarily taken into
captivity to be again liberated within
a day or two In an immense inclosure
in the Sequoia National Park, near the
Yosemite Valley, some one hundred
miles to <he nortli of the present
round-up.
Stirring scenes are those connected
with the capture of this antlered; band.
Men whose lifetime training lias been
among the cattle herds of the West,
each of Â»vhom is a part of the animal
he rides, whose eye Is clear and whosfe
wrist and hand possess the cunning
that comes only from a life of practice,
are engaged in the work. Fifty of these
picturesque vaqueros. the pick of the
men who attend to countless herds on
the great cattle ranches, are leading
in the work Â«f rounding up the elk,
and these animals, ttrough swift of
limb, appear not to be able to escape'
the noose thrown by the practiced hand
of their pursuers.
A year ago an effort was made to
take the elk into captivity to transfer
them to the Sequoia National Park, but
it was doomed to failure. An attempt
was made to drive the animals. Ott
that occasion two bands of Â«He were
headed northward by vaqueros. When
the animals found they were being
driven they scattered out Over the vast
territory that is practically a desert,
adjacent to the Coast Range, and efforts
to stop their flight resulted in the death
from exhaustion of about thirty large
elk. Now the new method of lassoing
and tying the Â«lk individually is in
operation and has proved successful.
After two days' work thirty-two elk
have been placed in. captivity in a
strong stock corral, and their transmis
sion to the park will be. easy. The
round-up if still in progress. "\u25a0 r

In. the meantime' 'the charges which"
Captain ..Anderson was to- have, made
against Helms wiil be withheld until af

sioners to give her testimony. .. The evi

court, -and, it is probable .that this .wo :
man, may 7 : make good her startling
charges. , She". will be given full opportun
ity to substantiate her statement. ;
/Captain Anderson was ordered by Chief
Dinan to prepare a charge of unofflcer
llke conduct against Helms. Accordingly
he called on Mrs. Helms yesterday. She
repeated her story that Helms. had beat
en her and acain said that her husband
had j told her I that he and \ other officers
had planned .to burglarize stores. She
was, however, very reticent yesterday af
ternoon, telling Captain. Anderson that
her attorney, had advised her not to talk.
Captain Anderson made a written report
to Chief Dinari and was ordered to pre
fer a charge against Helms. . This is . the
charge- which will be withheld until after
, the investigation. \ * ; ;
I ,'â¢ : POLICE LOOK FOR CRIME.
.Although .the. only, charge; that can to
day " be j placed ,' against .. Policeman j Helms,
is the allegation thit rie "is guilty of con
duct unbeco'niing an officer, yef the Police
Department is busy .searching for. other
bits of evidence which will 1 connect the
man with crime. \u25a0:\u25a0 -'-*':. '
â¢\u25a0'\u25a0. Chief Dlnan; stated yesterday after
noon that if such evidence could be se
cured the action would* be .: summary.
"There are a great many; stories of va
rious kinds - floating j about," he | said;
"but there is not one .bit of evidence
that Helms was^really guilty of bur
glarizing: stores Â«nd saloons or that he
was protecting, robbers j who were; ply
ing their trade along his- beat.; ; It. ia
impossible Vto convict a : man without
evidence, , and ; thus far "we g have; dis
covered nothing.
"On the other handUhere is evidence
that Helms was' vigilant against-bur
glars". ' It was ; only last February, the
night of ' the.: sth, : that. Helms, found
two robtiers ln*the grocery store ,of
H.^and R. Muegge.. cacner;, First: and
Harrison streets. ; Helms was patrolling
his beat when -he discovered :that^ the
store was being robbed, 1 and;he at once
started after; the men/: They : sfew him
coming and ran in different directions.
Helms followed one and chased "\u25a0 him
for several blocks. .Just off Fremont
street the one burglar. .; leaped : over .a
high fence and Helms let go a shot
from his revolver. It caught the :bur T
glar in the ankle, . but the , wound - Was
not severe enough to. stop his fliglit. : A
few days later this; man, was arrested,
proved to be 9 Frank | Hawley, and wag.
given six months for. petty, larceny. The
companion of the man is supposed; to be
James Morrissey., now ihcustody. sus
pected as the' murderer, of {Patrick. Mc-
Laughiin, a saloon-keeper/ on
ber 8, at Beale and Bryant streets."
, A glance at, the records of the depart
ment shows that Helms ijaadehis report
on- the â¢following'day and'that he was
active in- pursuingithejcriminala. .
The suspected v officer; appeared pearly
yesterday morning" at- the office of Chief
Dinariandwajs. given a hearing. .Helms
denied that he had ever beaten his wife
of that hÂ»s had "told her thai he. hud been
connected -with 'any, robbefles.v He said
that^his wife knew," at T the; time > of the
dismissal of Patrolmen - .Nightengale,
Chapelle and 'Gardner that he was on a
beat- near these men/ and. that \u25a0 she got
the names from the.papers at ;the .time
and then made the ,i statement; that
Helms was connected with them In rob
bery. > Helms was. earnest, in his denial
of . the alleged robberies. IHe retold. the
story Â«of how ; he: ; and- Patrolman, Rice i
were caught coming, out of < the
by Officer Logan Â£ and said, again that
they nad 'found the open, and

Disastrous Conflagration
BERKELEY. Nov. 18.â Fire that broke
out this morningf at 12.20 o'clock com
pletely destroyed the Berkeley Theater In
the Snattuck block, and It threatened to
destroy the First National Bank and the
town hall. The flre department under the
direction of Chief Kenney and Marshal
Vollmer. Is working hard to save the
choicest business blocks of Berkeley.
Already two explosions have occurred
and hundreds are flocking to the scene.
The origin of the explosions is unaccount
able as there is no knowledge of any
explosives in the burning buildings. The
flre was discovered in the roof of the
theater t*y Night Watchman George
Thompson, and soon spread throughout
the building and communicated to the
Bhattuck Block next door. The efforts of
the Fire Department are handicapped by
lack of water and the flames are still be
yond control of the fighters.
The First National Bank is threatened
on one side and on the other the Town
Hall stand* in the path of the flames.
A general alarm has been sounded and
volunteers are aiding the regular depart
ment in removing goods and protecting
property from the approaching flames.
The department contemplates turning In
a call to Oakland for assistance.
At 1:30 the walls of the Berkeley
Theater collapsed and the building,
valued at $25,000, is a total loss. In
falling the walls struck a telegraph
pole, breaking It off at the" sidewalk.
Fireman Frank Faulken was struck by
the pole and both his legs were crushed.
He may die. Two other firemen are
slightly Injured.
A switch engine from the Southern
Pacific pier has arrived and Is aiding
In securing water to fight the blaze.
Gasoline tanks In the hardware store
on the first floor of the theater build-
Ing are believed to have started the flre
and caused the explosions.
A call was sent at 1:30 to Oakland for
help, but at 2:10 the flames were under
control, this before the Oakland appara
tus arrived. The First National Bank
was slightly damaged by flames.

The Rodolph residence was a fragrant bower
of- chrysanthemums, carnations and- berries,
and among: the two hundred Â° gruests many no
ticeably beautiful .gowns were worn. . ;The
hosteee herself wore a very charming confec
tion of lavender and white plna cloth with an
underslip of lavender sllK. ' The dainty gown #
of pale blue silk and Honiton lace worn by
Mrs. George Hammer was an effecttve foil for

The Country Club Is a delightful spot at
which to entertain and has become quite popu

sides of the bay have taken to playing hostess
in eeml. public places. Unless one has an army
of servantsâ and one la lucky to count on even
a corporal's guard these days â the hotel or the
club is really a most convenient and comfort
able mode of entertaining. The great veranda
of the clubhouse to-day served most admirably
as a cardroom, where the ladies enjoyed "500"
and a delightful view or tne grounds at the
same time. A collation . followed the frames
and an orchestra of stringed Instruments kept
up a melodious accompaniment to the murmur
of voices during the afternoon. Mrs. Pond
who Is a very fine looking woman, wore a be
coming pearl gray silk, and her guest of honor,
Mrs. Wheaton A. Gray of Los Angeles, was
elegantly gowned In white. Mrs. J. Walter

'Prevents Players; Getting
Too Much of the Profits
OAKLAND,' Nov. 17. â The retail cigar
dealers- of Oakland have agreedupon a
new schedule for the payment of win
nings ; of the; nlckel-ln-the-slot i:;ma
chines that are . so ' important a ; factor
In their' business. â¢ The payments -have
been reduced,^ and, as a result,'; there ; ! ls
Indignation among-' the men, 5 who stand
for hours in front of cigar stores oper
ating: the machines and filling -them
with nickels. But ; the' playing? seems
not to have ; diminished" and the .^little
devices are being: worked overtime, de
spite the protests of the gramestera.v,, .
At a meeting: of the dealers at a local
cigar \u25a0 store A; Baumgarten ;of : San
Francisco was elected temporary, chair-^]
man I and H. Soharman secretary, Vand
the following: committee was appointed
to formulate the new schedule: A. F.
Baumgartner, B, Bercovlch, . W. Berco
vich, H. Sutliff and M. Friedman. The
committee reported on a number of
changes, among: them being to pay on
ho 'winning's less than a pair of queena,
but the payments on higher winnings
were increased. The schedule was
adopted, and further changes will prob
ably be made. .
Most of the cigar dealers formerly
paid two checks, or 10 cents In trade,
on each pair, including jacks. Now
nothing pays under queens.; It. is held
by the dealers that it is unfair to allow
customers to draw to "straights" : and
"flushes.*' unless they draw every time
an opportunity affords, or when four
cards of one suit appears. Some of the
patrons know where each card is
placed and will not draw some of the
suits on certain cylinders, thereby
causing a losa to the dealers. A ma
jority.of the dealers have agreed to the
schedule, as it now stands, and they
will accept the other changes contem
plated. The increases on the higher
winnings are: Three kings, from three
to four; three aces, from four to five;
straights, from five to six; four queens,
from ten jto twelve ; four kings, from
twelve to fifteen; four aces, from fifteen
to twenty. The "turkey," or play
whereby' cash Is paid for high win
nings, has, been eliminated. ;

SHOULD BEWARE

REASON FOBmS ATTACK
Venerable Philosopher Be
lieves It Necessary ~to
. Warn of Danger Ahead
â¢ BERKELEY, Not. 17.â Prof essor George
H. Howison, the professor of philosophy,
whose ; description of football', players as
"pig's" and ; of s "rooters"" as ."companion
swine" created a sensation on the campus
yesterday, to-day explains " ; that ;: In * thua
characterizing ', football â¢ devotees he 'was
merely , following out a practice performed
by him annually In line with his work of
inculcating ethics. â¢\u25a0''" ,;' '
'. Prof essor JHowlson has' given .to college
journalists who .sought Ito Interview him
the following statement", regarding his at
titude toward football and those who play
and those who pay to see it: â¢ :
''Every "fall for the past several years
It haÃ been my custom to I say something
about football. It pertains directly to the
line of thought which, we are trying to
develop ,In [this course: _ We' know that
habit Is a greater . controller than good
common sense. We get in the habit of
doing certain things and even though our
common sense may tell ,us i that 'it Is
wrong we don't give It a fair show but go
on letting habit control us. That is the
reason that football Is what it is to-day.
l"Football < is a brutal game, It Is even
worse than a prize fight.- The twenty-two
players Jump on top of one man, .they
don't intend to kill him, but then If. when
they pile off they find that one of the men
is maimed for life they shrug their shoul
ders and call for another man to take his
place and then start pounding: him to
death. ' :
â¢ ;.* 'And, the people, well-bred collegians,
lawyers, doctors and even professors, pay
$3 and $4 for seats to see the gruelling con
teat. They are nearly as" crazy' as the
players themselves, as they stand shout
ing their lungs out in the bleachers, wav
ing their colors and \ throwing their hats
In the air. To think that a civilized na
tion can go so mad over a feat which re
quires nothing but brute strength, no
brains, is more than I can understand.
"Two or j three days ago I was over in
the Faculty Club; even that .was tainted
with , this , degrading- football " atmosphere.
On. the walls .were several huge pictures
of the Yale-Harvard and other great foot
ball mills. .
"I hope the students won't misunder
stand me, for they forget that we who
axe older .can see things as they are and
not be led along by our hot blood, paying
little attention to the directions of our
good common sense."

PLAN FESTIVAL
AT UNIVERSITY
Unique Affair Proposed by
Professor Armes for Con
sideration by Students
OUTSIDE AID OFFEEED
Seniors Invited to Take Up
Idea, Which Includes Ani
'bitious Stage Spectacle
. BERKELEY, Nov. 17.â Professor j Wil
liam Dal lam Armes, chairman of the fac
ulty â¢ musical and fj dramatic committee,
: has presented to the senior .class , of the
university fdrjts consideration a -plan by
\u25a0which tit is proposed. to provide annually
In , the Greek Theater a great "harvest
festival.* of song, tableaux and drama, to
typify the ; life of the " tour i seasons as
Calif ornians know 'them. . " \u25a0\u25a0
Joseph : Redding of San Francisco, law
yer, musician, clubman and globe trot
ter, has discussed the matter with Pro
fessor Armes, suggesting that the exam
ple 'of the Swiss peasants and mountain
eers, who have .a, harvest festival each
year, be followed in part by the.univer
sity students, â¢ co-operating with ; outside
talent which might be used in preparing
for the tcreat festival.
It Is proposed to employ the seniors*
activities in this festival as a substitute
for the annual senior class extravaganza,
which is always given during, commence
ment week. The class this year has been
warned by the faculty that seniors who
fail to oasa in their final examinations
will not be allowed to plead that their
time Is required for .. extravaganza re
hearsals, as has been done heretofore,
and, this warning has left the class in
doubt about the wisdom ' of proceeding
with plans for the extravaganza. ..
Professor Armes believes the proposed
festival might properly take the place of
the o(ld-fashloned extravaganza, with its
burlesque features, and that the class of
'06 could add to Its laurels by being the
first class to introduce-and carry out the
Idea. : V
Money is promised from outside sources
to assist the students. If they approve of
Professor Armes' suggestion. \u25a0"*â¢.-;;

NEW RAILWAY
WOULD BUILD
IN SAUSALITO
Representative 6f California
Inland Empire Road Ask 3
Town Trustees for Right
to Buy Railroad Avenue
jFERRY SERVICE
TO SAN FRANCISCO
Half -Hour Schedule Between
This City and Land Ter
minal Is One of the Con
ditions to Be Fulfilled
SAU3ALJTO, Nov. 17.â A new railroad
into California from Boise City. Idaho,
with feed lines tapping the rich mineral,
lumber and grain belts of Washington
and . Oregon, and terminating in Sausa
11 to,* with ferry service to San Francisco.
Is what was promised to the* Sausallto
Town Trustees at their last regular meet-
Ing. The proposition was made by F. L.
Evans, representing the California Inland
Empire Railway and backed by the re
sources of St. Louis capitalists and the
St. : Louis Trutt Company.
Evanc appeared before the board with
a request for permission to occupy Rail
road avenue, erect terminals, build yards,
ahops ahd general offices, and lay tracks
through Sausallto, connecting San Fran
cisco by ferry with 1800 miles of railroad
tapping the Richest sections of the North
west.
The proposition of the railroad Is to
secure the franchise in escrow upon con
dition that 200 miles of railroad will bÂ«
laid within the State during the next
three years and the remainder of the
road constructed as soon as possible
thereafter. Mr. Evans also agreed that
the road would comply with a proposed
condition that a thirty-minute ferry serv
ice between Sausallto and San Francisco
be established.
In response to searching questions by
members of the board, Mr. Evans denied
that the road was in any way affiliated
with or backed by the Southern Pacific,
or that the application was a move by
the latter railroad to secure the undi
vided control of the Sausalito waterfront.
He said that already' opposition to the
road by the Southern Pacific was being
felt in the Northwest. The questions oÂ£
the Trustees were prompted by the fact
that the Southern Pacific is endeavoring
to acquire waterfront lands on all sides
of San Francisco Bay.
The Trustees, while Impressed with tiui
importance and possibilities of the propo
sition, are advancing slowly in the mat
ter. The proposition made by Mr. Evans
was taken under . consideration, and he
was instructed to place before the; board
the application for the franchise In writ
ing, together with the railroad's agree
ment to the conditions Imposed by the
Trustees. This proposition will be sub
mitted to the board at the next regular
meeting. Meanwhile the Trustees are
taking steps to -ascertain definitely
whether the Southern Pacific has any In
terest in the movement.
The conditions faced by the Trustees
In the matter of the right to occupy Rail
road avenue are peculiar. The avenue. is
composed of what are, known as tide
water lots. According to an act of thÂ»
Legislature bay cities may reclaim certain
water lots. The proposition "of the com
pany includes reclaiming of Railroad ave
nue that now lies under water and pur
chasing the lots from the owners. To do
this a large amount or money would be
expended by the railroad. The situation
of Railroad avenue runs parallel to and
east of the present terminal of tha
North Shore road.
The entrance of the new road would
mean much to San Francisco and Sausa
llto. The new company, according to Mr.
Evans, is prepared to reclaim the lands
build yards, shops - and wharves and
spend thousands of dollars a year in Sau
salito. It would place the city and the
bay towns In closer touch with the min
eral and lumber wealth of the North
we&t, and a feed line is destined to tap
the i Palouse wheat country of Washing
ton, bringing to this port the finest wheat
in the world.

Vessel That Helped to
Coal Czar's Ships
Is in Port.
German Steamer Ma
riechen Here From
the Orient.
The German tramp steamer Marie
chen. Captain Gerdes, which arrived
yesterday from Puget Sound, made a
hugre fortune during: the Russo-Japan
ese War in contraband trading. The
llariecheu, loaded with coal as a spec
ulation, followed Russia's Baltic licet
to the Far East. The collier kept away
from the Russian fleet until the war
vessels' need for fuel became serious.
The Mariechen's cargo was sold for an
enormous amount. Elated with the
success of the venture, Captain Gerdes
made a quick run to Hongkong, where
he loaded a carg-o of the supplies most
needed by the Russians. This cargo
also was sold at a vast profit.
The Mariechcn ran the blockade into
Vladivostok several times and luck
\u25a0was good in every venture.
The vessel is under charter to the
Barneson-Hibberd 'Company. The lla
riechen probably will take a cargo for
Vladivostok, but Captain Gerdes doubts
\u25a0whether it will be possible to get Into
that port. The Russians maintain an
ice-breaking- steamer and aim to keep
open a passage to the sea. but Captain
Gerdes says they usually do not keep
It open. This season the authorities at
Vladivostok have other troubles on
their hands, and it is almost certain that
no vessel will enter the harbor this
winter.
The Mariechen will load at Green
wich-street wharf No. 2, and for what
ever port tbe staemship clears, if for
tune favors as In the past, there the
collier will arrive on the appointed
time.
The Mariechen left Mororan in bal
last for Port Townsend, where orders
to proceed to this port were given.
Partly Dismasted in Storm.
The British bark Dumbritton, bound from
Hamburg for Honolulu, which was reported
the other day as having been sighted in a dis

The LHimbrltton encountered heavy weather
shortly, after lea -ing Hamburg and lost the
mainmast and the fore lower topsail yard.
The hull was undamaged and the bark Is not
leaking.

parison : with 1904, while imports de
creased $1.160.047..

THE NEW PLAN OF TAXATION.
''pHE commission provided by. the last Legislature has entered
I systematically and industriously upon the work of providing a
* new and reformed revenue law for California. The commission
consists of Senators Ward and Gurtin, and Assemblymen fTreadwell
and McCartney, with Professor Plehi) of the State University as
the expert member.
The commission has already trimmed the situation down to its
essentials. The plan is substantially that reported by the State
Grange, and heretofore explained and supported by The Call. It
separates the objects of taxation for State revenue entirely from
those subjected to local taxation. This saves the expense of the
Board of Equalization and, incidentally, the considerable expense of
cities and counties in pleading before that body against a raise in
iheir assessment to meet the needs of the State government. The
State tax under the plan proposed will' be raised from railroad and
other corporations, including banks, and by a liquor, license. These
will be exempt from local taxation.
The method of putting the railroad tax will cause some diffi
culty. On one hand it is proposed that it shall be a percentage on
the gross income of the roads. This will be. a complication, since it
must be only on the gross income of the traffic within the State. , We
are not aware -that' the railroads at present segregate their income on
local traffic from that earned on their . through business. Even if
they do, there 'will always be disputes about the correctness of -the
return. These disputes occurred over the enforcement of the Thur
man\bill to provide a sinking fund to pay the debt of the Central
and Union Pacific to the Federal Government. The < issue made
rich pickings for the political demagogues and railroad busters, "from
the Pacific to the Missouri River. California does not want to pro
vide cause for a renewal of injurious blatherskiting, -which never
does the people any good, but hinders a better adjustment of 'their
â¢relations to transportation. At the first look, then, it seems to us
undesirable to base the tax on income gross, or net. But it is a
matter that has two sddes, and when the obverse is disclosed there
may appear good reasons for abandoning this judgment. About the
taxation of the visible, tangible, physical property of railroads, that
remains fairly stable and not subject to fluctuation, there would
seem to be less difficulty and more certainty. \
The State. license of liquor selling is desirable. It would soive
the license problems which agitate so many communities, but its
arrangement is by no means easy. Cities and counties will want
to know how far it deprives them of the power to regulate the num
ber of saloons, or to prohibit them entirely. Sutter County, for ex
ample, refuses to license any saloons at all. Under the proposed plan
will the Stale have the power to locate and* license saloons in that
or any other county that does not want them? This difficulty is not
insuperable. The option may be deposited with cities "and counties
to regulate the number of saloons they will permit, conditioned upon
their procuring the State license. " . ' ,
Liquor and narcotics are legitimate objects of taxation and of
regulation by taxation. No matter how highly they are taxed their
consumption does not seem to be affected. But the State, in search
of revenue, cannot safely override the preferences of localities as to
the permission of liquor selling. As the tax is by means of a license,
it is entirely feasible to subject saloons to both State and local li
cense, as the\- are now subjected to Federal and municipal license at
the same time. As far as the banks are concerned it will no doubt
be more agreeable to them to deal directly with the" State than with'
the several municipalities. As they will be dealing directly with
sovereignty, it will doubtless be found that they will bear a more
just share of the public burden than at present.
The commission has applied its proposed plan to some, of the
counties, showing that instead of increasing their burden by segre
gating the objects of taxation they, will gain. In its report to the
next Legislature the commission should make this application of its
proposed plan to every county in the State, to the end that the people
may know exactly where they Trill stand. This is very necessary
* because an amendment to the constitution will be. necessary, and the
people will want all the enlightenment they can get in order to .vote
intelligently.
The commission may well include exemptions in the same
amendment. The burden of municipal taxation, without representa
ttion of benefit, upon American shipping owned within the State is
unjust and bears hard upon several industries. Foreign bottoms
and those under our flag owned outside the State do not pay this
municipal tax and therefore it works to discourage; the owning of
ships here- This is an unjust restraint upon California ' enterprise,
that we are sure the people will* cancel when- they understand its
importance to our productive and commercial interests v
While we are about it, it will be well to make a clean up of all
these questions, simplify our revenue system and remove unjust, and
unrequited taxation that is a restraint upon trade and enterprise. .;
THE AMERICAN JEW.
CROSSING among the various classes of Jews in this country
is a process which Jacob H. Schiff, speaking at the annual
meeting of the Educational Alliance in New York, said would
result in making the greatest Jew that ever existedâ the American
JaiNirt * Ck may be remarked that this is right in line with the opinions
of Luther Burbank as to the power of crossing of races in America
to produce the finest human stockâ almost; the superman, it seems.*
Schiff was talking about the terrible persecutions and massacres: of
Jews in Russia, and predicted it would mean an immense migration
to this country on the part of the race, to which the Russians are so
unfriendly. He said we should keep our doors wide open in wel
come to them, and gave as one reason for it this expected high de
velopment of the Jew under the uritrammeled freedom of American
institutions and the mingling here of the bloods of the five or six
principal Jewish races!' :' :
It will be remembered that the Jews are very soon to have a
great national celebration, of the anniversary of their arrival in this
eountrj and reception of citizenship. One of the objects of that
celebration is to make more generally known, by reiteration in
speech and literature, the importance and good- standing of Jewish
citizenship in our great composite of many, races, and religions:
Among the books of the; special series sent out by the 'Jewish .Publi
cation Society of America is one called "Jews and Judaism in the
Nineteenth Century," by Gustav Karpeles ; translated from the Ger
man. It is a resume of many big subjects in relation to the. Jews.;
It tells of the birth 'and growth of , anti-Semitism on the Continent;
of the essence of the Zionist movement; of the effects of Napoleon's
great Jewish Sanhedrim; of the Jews in America, of the seemingly
marvelous preservation of Jewish characteristics through the cen
turies; and- above all; of course, the highest 1 mission of the Jews]
the" thing that is pre-eminently their world- workâ the leavening of
all peoples with the elements of the loftiest ideals in religion. VHear,
O Israel. .' there one God." "In thee shall all the nations "of Ithe
earth be blessed." - i!-
Karpeles states that Israel is still what it always was, a religious
brotherhood. "Herein lies its peculiarity, its individuality ?' \u25a0 , From
remote antiquity it conceived its task to be to bring salvation. unto
the ends of the earth. It is on that truth Karpeles; bases his strong
objection to Zionism. He^says that were to revive the
national" sentiment in its adherents it would commit suicide./ ; "The
lowest stage of a religious development is, the primitive stage of a
national religion, the highest the stage of a world religion: \u25a0 * * *
Zionism would have us return to the primitive/ stage of a- national
religion." . â¢ '. \u25a0! \u25a0

WINE MEN BENT-ADULTERATION.
The following open, letter to the Health
Oilicer of this, city has been received by
The Call from' the Napa and Sonoma'
Wine Company: â¢ â¢ '
Dr. D. F. Ragan, Health Offlcer, City
of . San Franciscoâ ; .
Dear Sir: In the seventh report made
by . your City : Chemist on dry wines as
on file in your ofnee and as partly pub
lished Â»ln this i morning's paper, it is
stated that one- of -our wines. No. 73
Sauterne," contains an excess of sulphuric
acid, total amount of 364. m. g. per v llter.
Report pertaining to this item reads,
"Of the samples ' examined nine were
found to be preserved, with sajicy lie acid,
twowia benzole ac.^., and two with an
excessive - amount of- sulphltfes." '
. A. casual reader, of ' this sentence must
be led to the conclusion that the sul
phuric acid ..contained ..in the wine has
been added to the â¢ same with the same
purpose as the ; other ingredients, such
as .salicylic acid and benzole acid men
tioned above, while as a matter of fact
the existence of sulphuric acid cannot
be prevented, having been created In the
wine in course of . handling and aging
the same. ",';".
The standard for the quantity of -sul
phuric acid permissible in wine as es
tablished by the French Government is
575 m. g. per llte.r and in come wine as
high as 400 m. g. per liter. It should
stand to reason that in a^country; where
the wine industry has~oeeh existing for
the last thousand ; year3 ; the Government
knows It 3 business thoroughly in connec
tion with exercising" the proper sanitary
control over the same. ' But your chem
ist does jnot hesitate to jeopardize the
reputation of a firm known for the' purity
of its output'by allowing Its name to ap
pear in print as handling an article al
leged adulterated on account of the ex
istence of a necessary ingredient in the
wine less in quantity than other Govern
ments have permitted to be found in the
wines of .their, country.

CHARGES OF CRUELTY.
Cruel treatment of his spouse has cost A. W. Scott Jr., of the firm of Scott &Magner,
his young and pretty wife. She gained a decree of divorce yesterday from Superior Judge
Graham. The property rights were settled by stipulation! \ ""
Secures a Decree of

Spouse Chokes Her
and Threatens
Her Life.
"Mary Joseph Scott; no sir, not Jose
phine, just Joseph." positively an
nounced the wife of A. W. Scott Jr.,
member ot the firm of Scott .& Magner,
warehouse men and grain dealers, in
answer to Judge Graham's query as to
her full name. Mrs. Scott was In court
yesterday bent on securing: a divorce
and she secured It. Prettily gowned,
the pallor of recent illness ion her
cheeks, she made a good witness, and
while it is clear that she fully estab
lished her charges of cruelty she made
the fact fully evident that her spirit had
In nowise crumbled through the burden
of suffering.
"Is there not some way that you and
your husband can reconcile 1 your
differences." said Judge Graham kindly,
seeing a remote chance of adding to
his fame as a reconstructor of broken
homes.
"Positively and finally, no sir,"
answered Mrs. Scott as she readjusted
her pale blue hat at a bewitching
angle. Judge Graham took her word
for it.
"Let the case proceed," said the
court.
"My husband has been very cruel to
me." said Mrs. Scott. "He remained
away night after night and refused to"
tell me where he had been. Then he
choked me and one day threatened me
with a revolver. He has destroyed my
happiness and my health."
MUSE TELLS OF ai'ARREL.
Miss Minnie S. Sharp, professional
nurse, followed Mrs. Scott to the
stand. She related a vivid story of a
Quarrel in the household of the Scotts.
"One evening," she said, "Mr. and Mrs.
Bcott quarreled violently, and finally,
hearing some one fall. I went into the
room. Mrs. Scott was on the bed, her
throat showing the marks of her hus
band's fingers. She was crying bit
terly. He was lying on the floor and
by his side -was a revolver with which
she told me he had threatened her life.
I was much alarmed and soothed Mrs.
Scott as best I could. This, however,
is the only time I ever knew Mr. Scott
to injure his wife and I have been in
the household practically since last
May." " - ...
N<>xt to the stand went Dr. William C.
Reil.y, who. while he carefully smoothed
his stlk hat. gave a clinical history of the
house of Scott and what he had learned
were the causes of the hysteria from
which Mrs. Scott frequently suffered.
"Knowing." said the doctor, "that there
must be some underlying cause for Mrs,
Scott's condition, I finally asked her If
any trouble was weighing on her mind.
PHYSICIAN INTERCEDES.
"Then she confessed to me that her hus
band was treating her cruelly and I no
ticed the bruises on her throat she said
were marks left by his fingers when he
choked her. I then went to Mr. Scott
and asked him to mend his ways. I told
him that he should remain -at home
nights and not cause his wife further
worry, for I doubted that her condition
would yield to treatment unless the cause
thereof was removed.
"But Mr. Scott was obdurate. He told
me that he had finally made up his mind
to have nothing more to do with his wife,
but he informed me that anything neces
sary In the way of nurses and medicines
he would gladly provide. I told him to
measure his words well, as the condition
must not go on. He said he had weighed
them fully and that - his decision was
final."
â¢ This was sufficient proof of the allega
tion of Mrs. Scott and Judge Graham or
dered that the decree issue. The property
right* of the parties were settled by stlpr
ulatlon. Mrs. Scott agreeing to surrender
all claim to Mr. Scott's property upon the
payment to her of $1W a month for her
natural life, or until such time as she
might remarry. .

One sor.t of diet may make a person de-

A young woman from Phil, says:^--
"For Eeveralyeare I kept in a run-down
miserable sort of condition, was depressed
and apprehensive of trouble. I lost flesh
in a distressing way and Bee me d in a
perpetual sort of dreamy night mare. No
one serious disease showed, but the 'all-

"Finally between the doctor and father
I was put on Grape-Nuts and cream, as
it was decided I must have' nourishing
food that the body could make use of.,'
"The wonderful change that canje over
me was not, like Jonah's g^urd, the
growth of a single night, and yet it came
with a rapidity that astonished me. Dur-
ing the i first week I gained several
pound* in weight, my #pirits improved,
and the world began to look brighter and
more worth while. And this has - con-
tinued steadily, till now. after the use of
Grape-Nuts for only a few weeks, I am

DUCK SHOOTERS
ARE ANXIOUS
Birds Are Numerous in the
Bay, but Require a Storm
to Make Them Move
Owing to the long continued dry
weather the duck shooters have had
but poor sport recently. Until rain
comes or there is a decided change in
the weather the shooting will continue
poor. Many preserves afford neither
bait nor water for the birds and are
thus uninviting. ,
. The situation has become so strained
that a number of market hunters have
retired from the field. This is a bless
ing in disguise, as every day they are:
in retirement means that the lives of
many ducks are saved. That ducks
are scarce is shown by the high prices
that prevail in the markets.
If birds are scarce on the preserves
they are numerous on the bay, but out
of reach of the gunners. The Mar!n
chore of the . bay is covered with
canvas-backs which are living on the*;
clams. The birds have not found their
way over to the San Pablo" shore up
to the ' present time. Many northern
birds have come in recently.
Phil Bekeart and three members of
the Family Club were among the few
fortunate ones last Sunday, each se-,
curing lin:it bags on the club preserves
on the fiulsun marsh. *
W. W. Richards, the star shot of the
Montezuuia Gun Club, had a splendid '
day after snipe last Sunday. He' bag-!
ged twenty of the long bills in addition !
to some ducks.
Charles Wagner bagged fifteen. ducks j
at Alt. Eden last Sunday. This was an j
excellent shoot under prevailing con- I
ditions.-o % tiu j"
The weather conditions have .brought j
quail shooting to a standstill. Rain \u25a0
will also Improve this sport. Clarence ;.
Kaumas and his brother Howard bag- â¢\u25a0

Prite.
The handicap doubles tournament be
ing played by the Scottish bowlers on
'the Golden Gate Park green has proved
to be tbe most popular style of play. ,
It is a round robin affair, and t nis fact 'â¢
probably explains its popularity. In -
a freeze-out toi:rnamcnt the unsucccss- i
ful players lose interest in the event!
vrhen they have been eliminated. In the ;
present tournament every team has a
right to meet every other team, regard- j
les* of the number of defeats., i
* There is an unusually close and In- j
terestlng race for first place, between !
two of the teams. Both have a liaradi- i
cap of 3 points and are far ahead of !
the other teams in the competition. '
They are J. McJLachlan and G. C. Pat- j
terson and Robert Park and W. R. !
Eaton. The, former have played. ninÂ« i
grarees and won them all. Park and'
Eaton have won nine, games out of

FAVOR ASSOCIATION GAME
CARDINAL MEN
LOOK FORWARD
Intend to Have an All-Star
Football Aggregation in
the Field Next Year
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 17.â
The big game has been played and the
result is entirely satisfactory to the
football fans of the Cardinal. As the
management, in accordance "with the
expressed desire of the faculty, has re
fused all offers with outside teams for
post season games, the followers of the
pigskin have been Obliged to resort to
discussing the future prospects of the
moleskin heroes next year. Should the
predictions of the most optimistic come
to pass Stanford will have an ' all-star
aggregation of veterans. \u25a0 -j^
The actual number of the- present
winning:, team that will return to col
lege next autumn is hard to toll. Of
the star team of 1904 many were sched
uled to be present that did not arrive.
Captain^elect Sprott and Jim Weller
were both good fof^another. year had
the "nunk-out" committee been will
ing. This state of affairs is capable Of
repetition. r c^-. v n - â¢
i'he ouly man who will 'surely be lost
and one who has been, a bulwark of
strength in the Cardinal line for the
past four ' consecutive years is- R. A.
Thompson, '05. He will not return :to
college. He would not be eligible in
any case, as. by the intercollegiate
agreement with California, he is ; dis
qualined by. four years of participation
and because the last: one was during
his post graduate course.
"Bull" Chalmers is in his Junior year.
It is not known definitely what hi 3
plans are. At one time it was rumored
he would not return this season but
would uike up work in a medical col
lege. This report has proved false and
judging; from authoritative sources he
will be! back for his degree.
Stott ;will be here next term and will
be. a great help: to -the. team. Vander
voort, the dashing" lefthalf who was re
sponsible for one of the touchdowns. of
the day, is. a sophomore and with his
team mate,' Dole '07, are fixtures for: at
least another game,
. The' line will suffer little change.' On
it there were besides Thompson- two
other seniors, 'Frizzell and .'Lyons.
Neither of these men is a candidate for
graduation and look good for another,
year. . . .
The tackles are Crawford and Horton,
'09 anr* '08 respectively, and are eligible
to plaj three years more.- '--
This- 's the team â¢ of men which en
tered tte game first. .; Besides this num
ber thÂ»i-e are two others, Stanford and
Siusheif They have both signified their
intention to return. .* ...
AddeS to this formidable lineup are
the rumors of the return of. Smith and
Butterifeld, two ends of the t 'O4 team.
Thuslit is an easy matter to account
for th* confident view with ;\u25a0 which
Stanford adherents look forward to, the
game of 1906- on the California, field;
with Jimmic Lanagan as coach, Dad
Moulton as trainer and "Stanford spir
it" as a backbone.' : \u25a0 ... j

would not let any of. the professional

were more of; the bench show type rath

unfortunate In having her dogs meet

SILVER CUPS OFFERED

Sunday Is Open to Mem
bers of All Golf Clubs
Beginning at 10 o'clock this morn-
Ing, or as soon thereafter as may be
found convenient, mixed foursomes,
with handicap, . will be played en 'the
links of the Burllngame Country Club.
Players may enter In couples and any
who may not have partners will ba
paired at the clubhouse. The play will
be over eighteen holes, medal score,
and the winning couple will receive' a
pair of two-handled silver cups, pre
sented by Mrs. Henry T. Scott.
There will be a handicap over the
same course to-morrow, beginning af
ter the arrival of the 9 a. m. train from
San Francisco. This will be open â¢to
members of any golf club. It was. at
first intended that the play should be
over eighteen holes, but In order to
furnish the visiting golfers with occu
pation throughout the day, it has been
decided to make the contest a thirty
six-hole one, eighteen holes being
played In the morning and eighteen in
the afternoon. The player who hands
In the 'best net score, medal play, will
receive a handsome - silver-mounted
blackjack, presented by C. O. Hooker.
The sixth tournament of the Cali
fornia Women Golfers' Association on
the Burlingame links on Wednesday
was the last of the first series and also
the last that will be held by the asso
ciation during the present year.
Wherever golfers are gathered
nowadays remarks are heard upon
the greatly Increased Interest man
ifested - in the game. For the re
. vival of enthusiasm among the women
the California Women's Golf Associa
tion Is almost wholly responsible.
Among the men the acquisition of the
new course at Ingleside has done much.
Though good work has been accom
plished on the Ingleside course, the
fair green Is still soft, the soil being
of a light and sandy sort. Golfers are
awaiting eagerly the first heavy rains,
which will tend to compact the course.
After a wet season or two, it is the
general opinion among golfers that no
course on the Pacific \u25a0 Coast will be so
Interesting and conducive to good golf.
The rolling game, which is so profitable
on thenard, dry courses at Burllngame.
Fair Oaks, Linda Vista and elsewhere,
will not be possible on the Ingleslde
course, which will have a good cover
ing of turf and. will require approach
shots of the orthodox sort.
The new Presidio Golf Club, which
has the old course and clubhouse of the
San Francisco Golf Club, is prospering.
Most of Its members are beginners at
the Scotch game, but already some are
showing signs of becoming good play
ers in due time. Bernard Faymonvlll'*
and L. B. Edwards have been out of
town, but on their return arrangements
will probably be made for an opening
tournament. . Several members pro over
the course on Saturdays and Sundays
for practice and a few are to be seen
on the links every afternoon. The Pre
sidio links, like all others In this part
of the. State, needs rain badly.
STEPHENS SAYS
MAILS GO FAST
The article that appeared In The Call
of yesterday morning relative to postal
matters in San Francisco ; has stirred
-up some of the officials of the Postof
flce Department. This is particularly
-true of that" portion relating: to the
railway \u25a0 mail service. Superintendent
A, H. Stephens of "the railway mall
service makes the following statement:
The article does a great injustice to my serv
ice. It has \u25a0 been demonstrated that, wtth a
little \u25a0 Improvement, . which is now In contem
plation. < the transportation facilities of San
Francisco will be all that can be desired. We
have not yet provided tor a dispatch from tho
ferry to the postof flee between " the hours of
l-:45 and 5:15 a.m., but this matter is pend
ing and, doubtless 'action- will be taken within
a short Use.3BHMMnM|HMaiM
On only two occasions during: the last thirty
two days have the malls from Southern Pacific
train No. 1, which brings ' a largo quantity of
mall for > San Francisco, arrived at the ferry
too late. for connection to the last car, leaving
under- the present authorized schedule at rj:-KÂ»
a, m. On one of these occasions the boat carry-
In?, the mail arrived at ' -tills a. m., and on the
other occasion at 3:12 a. m. In each instance
the mat! arrived at the postofflce at 5:21 a. m.
It .would hardly be practicable to deliver by
wagon before 3:2 1 a. m. mails arriving at
4:28 a. m., .as it would be necessary for a
team to go from the barn to the depot, and the
malls to be loaded and carried to Seventh and
Mission streets. With emergency arrangements
fcr wagon service,' the mall arriving on the one
occasion at 3 : 12 a. - m." could probably have
been advanced in delivery at the postofflce by
qno hour cr'a* little more. ;â¢.-â¢.
During the . twelve days prior to . the pub
lication of the article train No. 1 has arrived
at the ferry In time for delivery of the mail
at the postofflce on the evening of arrival. . On
no * occasion ' since . the main ' distributing \u25a0 force
was \u25a0 removed â¢\u25a0 from Ferry station - to- ; the new
postoffice building has any mall for Menlo
Park. San ,Mateo. Redwood City, Sausallto,
San Rafael. San Jose, or any other place, been
delayed :on account ' of the . change In , tho
manner of handling the , malls. The clerks .of
Southern Pacific train ; No. 1 make up â¢ a,
direct pouch for coast line train Xo. 32. due to
leave Third and Townsend streets at 6 :10 , a .
m.. and in every case has the connection : been
made to that train. " The first dispatch for San
Rafael and Sausallto is at tJ-30 a. rp., and In
every case " has the i connection ; been made
through the San Francisco " office to those
places. JfWBBBUWMiii* m m i
ItwiU be seen from this statement that the
criticisSi of the railway mall service Is incor
rect.* Us also the assertion that the railway
mall ; r.rvic* in and around San Francisco la
not upf to date. I 'think It Is well known by
all \u25a0of -^he commercial houses who keep close
track Jt UÂ»etr mall, and by every : man who
knows Anything about the business of the Post
office department, that the railway mail serv
ice on* the - Pacific Coast Is the best of any
services' of 'Its kind the Vnlted States' a
statement â¢ to â¢ that effect can be \u25a0 made without
any fair of contradiction. ' \u25a0 - ,

Although Dcutschland beat Tocoiaw on
"Wednesday, the latter horse was Installed
iavorite for the Watercress handicap
over six furlongs, run yesterday at Oak
land.
Iladtke replaced Minder in the saddle,
and this may fcave had some effect. Giv
ing Radtke credit for being a better rider,
Tocoiaw ran a vastly improved race. He
caught Tomn.y Clark on Deutschland
before reaching the stretch a.nd tho pair
fought It out, the favorite scoring by a
neck in 1:13%. Fireball exhibited a trace
of his best form by running third, three
lengths away.
Favorites were successful on four es

AUBCCIIOX*Â« BAD HIDE.
To Aubuchon falls the distinguished
honor of getting the l-to-3 favorite, Sil
ver Sue, beaten, In the opening live and
& half furlong scramble for two-year
olds. When Holtman sprung the barrier,
the Curl rider did not appear to be ready,
and the first choice was almost left.
Oomllfo, a 7-to-l chance at post time,
mii.de a runaway. race of it, winning by
himself. Merry Go Round led Silver Sue
out for the place.
Better success attended the efforts of
Alencn, another from the Williams sta
ble, and a 3-to-2 choice, in the all-aged
Bprint which followed. The three-year
old showed clear off the field right after
the start, and won at the close with
plenty in reserve. Graham finished sec
ond on Cousin Carrie, a length before
The Roustabout.

Knapp Epreadeagled his field in the
mile selling affair. The Lady , Rohesia,
which opened a 6 to 5 favorite and re
ceded to 13 to 5, secured place honors
from Ikki, a 25 to 1 shot. Possart
made a good showing from where he
got away.
I.IHK.M' IS A SURPRISE.
Lurene, a 12 to 1 outsider with
Kr.app in the sadle, upset an awful
eood thing in the fifth, a six and a
half furlong Jaunt. On her second to
Epicure some days ago Good Cheer
looked on paper like a bargain, and
intending speculators purchased lib
erally at odds of 7 to 10.. The favorite
experienced considerable difficulty in
shaking off Lucrece. a 50 to 1 choice,
and later when challenged by Lurene
fell by the wayside. The winner ran
practically unbacked. The show went
to Lucrece.
â¢In the closing mile purse run the
colors of Captain Rice were seen to the
fore for the rst time here when the
Arkansas turfman's good horse/ Right
ful, was returned a winner. The son
of Pirate of Penzance had a strong call
in the betting, and when Goodchild let
him down on the stretch turn, he
passed Celeres and led Gorgalette past
the wire by five lengths. Old Divina
had quite a following and finished a
fair third.

he went to the carpet ; and did not rise

iiig.- 1 Hi e So-Called Open
Style -oi Game This Year
NEW HAVEN/ Nov. 17.-E very thing Is
in readlncss3 for the Yale-Princeton foot
ball, game to-mQrrow'and as flne ; weather
Is predicted the crowd promises to be a
reconl-breaker. A score in double figures
is expected by- Yale, but as it la a col
lege tradition that Princeton- always plays
her best game against thÂ© blue the un
dergraduate body seems to be prepare A
for anything. " . . .â¢
â¢The men of Old -Nassau. were not no
much in evidence to-night as in the ye&ra
when Princeton team came here for
overnight quarters. The making of
wagers on the outcome has never been
so insignificant. A few bets with Yala
giving odds of 2 ; to 1 were reported la
cafes, but "little money . was" In : sight.
Yale has- been consistent in winning her
practice games and has not yet had her
goal line crossed. Princeton fell before
the onslaught of. Dartmouth's eleven and
ha 3 been scored on by other teams. It
ts' because of the somewhat remarkable
showing of Yale with a team which, ov->
ing to its light weight, has been unab â¢
to use. to any extent the heavy taci:<3
plays oÂ£ the past years, that the \u25a0 sona
of Ell are so full of confidence in wli
ning. Both teams have been playing tie
so-called "open came," Yale to a mo â¢
pronounced extent than her rival, in
which end and quarterback runs have
been frequent.
The Princeton team stopoed over in
New York to-night, but members of fi?
vanguard from that college wno-havs
reached here report that every man is in
prime condition and full 'of couragcr and
especially happy â¢ over the prospect of
good weather. -
Trainer Mack of Yale says that every
man who has been prepared for tfiÂ»
Princeton game is in good condition.

FOUR MEN DIE
ON THE GALLOWS
CARSON, Nov. 17.â J. P. Sevener.
Fred Roberts, Al Linderman and T. b.
Gorman were hanged here to-day ,for
the murder of Jack Welch. The execu
tion took place within the shoe shop
of the State . prison and there was no
hitch in the \ programme save a delay
in the execution of Gorman and'Rob
erts'on account of an attempt made to
secure a stay for Roberts, who had
been - exculpated in a confession made
at the last moment by .Gorman. The
Board of Pardons refused to. Intervene,
however, and at 1 :23 p. m. Gorman ' and
Roberts were hanged, Sevener .and
Linderman having been hanged at
10:53; this morning. .
Before Â«the drop was made Gorman
prayed for mercy for his past sins and
stated I that he had committed a
burglary In San Francisco in IS9B for
which a man named .Barker had been
unjustly convicted. Barker is now In
prison serving a life . sentence.
"Good-by, Warden," were Sevener's
last words a. second before the trap
was .sprung 1 . -, "Good-by, - Roberts,"
meaning a Carson attorney, and "Good
by, Craig," to a Reno attorney, shout
ed Linderman.
the echoes had died away In
the old shoe shop the trap was sprung
and the bodies dropped six feet. In
a moment physicians were at their
slde3 and with watches in hand they
counted the pulse beats until life was
extinct. "Gentlemen, the physicians
pronounce the men dead. Roberts and
Gorman will hang at 12 o'clock." With
this brief announcement from Warden
Considine the crowd dissolved and
gathered in the open air to await the
execution of the other men.
The crime for which the four men
were convicted was committed In Hura
boldt. county /in August, 1903. For
months a reign of terror had prevailed
in that sectien on account of acts of
bands of thugs who rode up and down
the railroad line robbing trainmen and
citizens. Public feeling was at an in
tense pitch when Jack Welch was
robbed and shot to death on a freight
train by four men and It was with
difficulty that the people were prevent
ed from lynching Gorman, Sevener,
Linderman and Roberts after their ar
rest by the officers and their identifica
tion by the dying Welch.
The men were tried twice in \u25a0 the
lower courts, once at Wlnnemucca and
the second time at Reno, the Supreme
Court setting the first verdict aside.
Another appeal was taken again, but &
rehearing, was denied. . Efforts ' to se
cure a commutation of sentence by the
Board of Pardons also failed.
Sevener, aged 45 years, was a marine
engineer, and had served terms In Cali
fornia-and 'Washington penitentiaries
for. robbery. Gorman, whose real name
was O'Brien, was a San Francisco lino
type operator. Roberts, whose name
was Fred Reid t, was a St. Louis brass
finisher. Linderman, also known as
Williams, was from Stockton. Cal.
BELGIAN HEIR

PASSES AWAY
BRUSSELS. Nov. 17.â The Count of
Flanders, brother of King Leopold and
heir \u25a0to the throne, died at 11:30 o'clock
this i morning:. Death was due to Inflam
mation of the respiratory 1 organs. ' 'â¢ The
Count -was ' born In \u25a0 1837. \u25a0
'The, new "heir to the throne* of Belgium

reigning house of Belgium. He is of a
studious disposition and bears a striking
resemblance to his uncle. King Leopold.
Prince Albert has- traveled â¢ extensively.

Belgians. .
'It is possible that the Belgian Socialists
will cause trouble when it is proposed
to transfer." to Prince Albert the ; present
annual grant of $40,000 paid to the Count
of Flanders, as, heir. apparent. When' the
late Count proposed some time ago to re
nounce" his succession In favor of Prince

enormously rich." announced * their. Inten
tion of opposing In the strongest manner
possible the transfer of the grant.

LACK OF RAIN
IS BADLY FELT
EUREKA,, Nov. 17.â Rain began falling
here this morning shortly before noon
after the dryest spell the county has ex
perienced In many years. Up to 6 o* clock
this evening .06 of an Inch was recorded
and prospects are good for a- continuance
of the downpour. The rain is of Immense
benefit to the stock and dairymen in this
county who have suffered heavily as the
result of drought. The forest flres whiru
have done great damage will be quenched
by the rain.
-Cattle on .the ranges are ayins
for want of feed, grass being ex
ceedingly short. In. many places tires
have swept the ground perfectly bare
and destroyed small and damaged
large timber. Fires recently raged a!ong
Mad River near the Humboldt-Trin
ity line, burning over many square miles.
The flames swept to the top of South Fork
Mountain and descended on the Trinity
side. Residents of that section of the
country as one man fought the flames
night and day. and with difficulty saved
i their houses and barns. The stock that
sought refuge in canyons, escaped the
flames to die of hunger.
Lack of rain is affecting the fish mi
i dustry, three packing industries on Eel
River havfng laid off many men because
the fishermen are unable to catch any
salmon. River men say that a good rain
I would bring many fish into the river
again. There was a small run of salmon
up the river yesterday.
The precipitation this fall has been but
1.33 Inches, while there should have been
about ? inches.

SCARCITY OP POWER.
Dry Spell Affects Output of tne Bay
Conntlea Company.
. VALLEJO. Nov. 17. â The long-continued dry
spell U causing a great deal of embarrassment
to the Bay Counties Power Company and thÂ»
large consumers of electricity In this portion
of the State. The big cement works at Nap*
Junction and at Sulsun have been compelled
to curtail thflr output owing to a lack ox
power to. operate to their full- capacity, and
as a consequence there to a scarcity of cement
in the San Francisco 'market. The W8 rock
crushing and building stone quarry of the B.
B. & A L. Stone Company at Cordelia Is Â«uf
fÂ«ring.and. at Martinez and Selbys. where tnÂ«
large consumers of electricity . require a gr*at
deal of "Juice" every day. there Is also trouble.
All the power for the Mare Island navy
yard is also supplied by thÂ« Bay Counties
Company and. whllÂ« there has been no cur
tailment of the amount of power supplied thÂ«
Government, the 2000 employes are Just *\u25a0
anxious fcr rain as the up country farmers.
Flr*t Rain In Redding.
REDDING. Nov. 17.â The Brat rain of thÂ«
season fell here this afternoon. All through
the Sacramento River Canyon territory rain
fell to-day. At Sisson there was a heavy
downpour. The rain in South Cottonwood last
year 'at this date amounted to over fifteen
inches, against Just a trace this year.

NEW YORK. Nov. 17.â The stock market
atr.timent had become composed this morning
cÂ»er the Russian outlook and prices rebounded
at the opening. In many places the first game
were widely extended during the course of the
cÂ»y. but the speculative taste showed the same
â¢eridt-ncy ttward soeciaiization as for some
â¢Ime jiatt. The money market was tranquil by
Â»tnpttr:ssn with the feverish tone of the earlier
;art o: iU week and the prevailing rate ail
cay was 0 per cent. The action cf the foreign
txchar^e market Indicated that yesterday's :
Molest advance was due &s much to the Iriyht

larly during the day. Russian bonds recoA"ered
abruad and a formal statement from the agency
<Â£ one oi the great French basks in St. Peters
turg had a reassuring effect there and cleared
xzp the : iiT.:_ky conditions !n Russian finan
cial affairs. The conicaraxive <-ace of the
mtney ir.arket served as a reinforcement
agiitfrt any apprehension that might be caused
by the prefercirary estimates 01 the week's

Jn the cash â¢-. liint" of the banks, the esti
mated verytn* from less than $2,000,000 to
uiward of $3.tÂ«To.Oo<>. Of this amount the eub

doubt thst the b*nk* have shipped currency on
raianee also to the interior on the regular ex

$2.42*,i>00 thiÂ» movement would eeem to in

at the banks is expected as a matter of course
to kiÂ»ow a larsre reduction. The failure of to
morrow's bank statement to chow a restora-
Ucs of tfce reserves to the legal limit would
undoubtedly cause surprise to speculative sen

the rate at which the preceding Issue was al

standard railroad stocks had a more general

these two stocks* there were a large, numtxr

Butte, Amalgamated and Mohawk. The buy-
Ing of North Butte was very Bcattered but 1
powerful and, although the liquidation was j
heavy, the price held up wonderfully well.
Amalgamated is being well bought and 90 is
freely predicted. The situation at the close
was generally bullish.

CHICAGO, Nov. 17.â Weakness ln^ the wheat,
market developed toward the end of; the first
hour Early in the session the prevailing een
tlment was bullish . and moderate gains were
recorded. At the opening the May opUon was
unchanged to â¢ He higher ,at bB%@BS%c. On_
active demand irom v commission houses' and
local shorts the nrice quickly rose to S9 %c
The buying was largely the result of - the
strength shown in the price of- wheat at Euro
pean grain centers, all the foreign markets be
ing somewhat above the crices of yesterday.
Small shlcments from \u25a0Argentine and- the con
tinuance of disturbed conditions in Russia
apparently formed the - basis of the strength
abroad. Small receipts in the Northwest lent
also a bullish influence to the market. On the
other hand, there was 1 a less urgent demand
for cash wheat at Minneapolis, which resulted
In a reduction of Its premium over the Decem
ber option. Near the end of the first hour the
market showed signs of weakness. Prices
broke sharply on liberal selling by prominent
bulls Rumors credited one house with sales
of over 1,000.000 bushels of ' May wheat. Al
most immediately there . was a general rush on
the part of the pit traders to sell. The decline
brought out numerous stop-loss orders in the
commission houses. For May the lowest point
of the day was reached at 87%@57%c. The
close was weaJt. with prices near tha : lowest
point of the day and with a net loss of %Â©%c

' Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Foreign futures , were firmer., Chi

Important" factor later. > The revolutionary ten
dency and the fear ; that their property might
be c confiscated , .by . \u25a0 the â¢; Government \u25a0 - have â¢

sponsible - for - the . large - Russian shipments.
From: what we can gather there will be a;ma
terial falling off in their shipments In the near

â¢It appears that the quotation of 49c tor
selected California ranch Eggs ; made :on \u25a0 the
exchange on Thursday waa due to some con
cession among 'the members' during the call,
as the new method \u25a0of making sales Is still
more or less unfamiliar to the majority of the
dealers. This explains the apparently erratic
course Of the Egg market during the past two
days. Yesterday the market recovered its lost
ground and more, too, - as . one. dealer bad a
number of buying , orders, in the. filling of
which prices were sent up 3c. as will be seen.
The market .is still - slenderly supplied with
these goods, though : stocks are hardly as
meager as they were a week ago. â¢ ,
Cheese Is very firm, as supplies continue
light, and there is now a good demand for
shipment to the Orient.
Butter remains unchanged, as the demand
and supply about balance. .
- Sales on . the exchange were : 10 cases Cali
fornia selected ranch Eggs. 60c: 15 cases .10,

STREET INSPECTOR BOOXE
DIES OF PARAXTSIS
City Official fnccnmbi to lIImeM Con
tracted After InTestlsvtlon Into
Yorke Company's Contract.
Street Inspector William R. Boon* died yes
terday at his hoxna, 216 Seventeenth avenue, of
a stroke of p&raJysls. Boone Â«xpirlenced two
attacks of the disease several months ago, but
was apparently Improving. He reported for
duty .it the office- of the Bureau of Streets at
8 o'clock Thursday morning and went home at
the close of office hour*. He was stricken sud
denly with paralysis and died at 4:30 o'clock
the next morning.
Boone was born in B&lexn. Or., and was 66
years at axe. He came to this city fifteen
yours ero and was an employe In the De
partment of Works for several years. Boone
was taken sick shortly after the conclusion of
the investigation held by the Supervisors'
Finance Committee last year relative to the
correctness of the charges made for repairs to
bituminous pavements by Uie F. M. Yorke
Company, which had the contract for the work.
Boone was subjected to a rigid cross-examina
tion as to his measurements, and the strain
caused the Illness from which he finally died.
Boone's henesty was never called into question,
however.
The funeral of the deceased Inspector will
take place to-morrow from the residence of hlÂ»
eon-ln-law at 3550 Twentieth street.
Dr. George R. Harris will remove his offices
from 6 OTarrell to rooms 106 and 108, Phelaa
building, about November 15. â¢
Will Tent Validity of Law.
Commissioner of Works Alg^ltlnger yesterday
declared his Intention to test the constitutional
ity of the charter provision requiring the Board
of Works to repair defective sidewalks. The
provision will be tested In one of two ways.
The Board of Works will prepare to award a
contract for the repair of some sidewalk and
a restraining- order will be sued out by the
Interested property owner. Some property^
owner will also be arrested for falling to put
bis sidewalk In pood condition and a writ of
habeas corpus will be Issued. > Either of the
proceedings will be used to test'the validity of
the law.

Glad Andretrs Is Dead.
Chief Dinan received a letter yesterday from
W. E. Reynolds, ex-Chief of Police of Colo
rado Springs, that he was r^ad to bear of the
death of Milton Franklin Andrews. "He said
he had accumulated & . -meat deal of evidence
against Andrews in connection with the mur
der of Bessie Bouton, which- he considered
sufficient to have convicted b oi." .He . wanted
ta see a copy of Andrews' conic-salon, and con
eratulated Chief Dinan In,, dosing up the

From pleu&nt. sunny quarters In the Paxrott

the most active members of the board of trus

of reducing: expenses, although the Â»x:lety has
never In He- history been so etrong financially
as It la to-day.
An average of forty visitors a day to the
present offices will hardly Ibe maintained at
the Dew center of activities In the Potrero.
Of course, the secretary will ccc the old fa
miliar faces of the Eas, water and telephone
men, but It Is probable that few cases of cru
elty will be reported except by r wire. The
officers have worked with Market street as a
center, but under the new conditions the city
can hardly be patrolled as well In the- future
as at present If the same number of men are
employed. The public pound is already located
at Sixteenth and Alabama streets, and the
consolidation of offices may prove of benefit.
The employes do not view the change with
equanimity.
The Pacific Humane Society and the Uni
versal Service Society, both of which aim to
do much the came class of work as the older
organization; should find a field for expansion.

HOCKONG CLUB
BLACKBALLS HIM
Europeans at British Colony
Deny : S. Silverstone Mem
bership in Organization
Sholom Bllyerstone, ' former secretary
of the Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company, and now agent at Hong
kong for the Harriman steamship lines
has been blackballed at the Hongkong
Club, around which- revolves the busi
ness and social life of the. British col
ony. Silverstone's friends in this city
declare that the steamship man is the
victim of anti-Semitic feeling. People
who arrived, from the Orient on the
liner China, among them members of the
club, say that Silverstone's own acts
were responsible for his present hu
miliating position. v â¢ .
To be blackballed by any club, any
where, is apt to hurt, the pride if not
the standing of the victim, fro be
blackballed by the Hongkong Club is
to be barred, i virtually, j from all social
intercourse with decent Europeans and
to be heavily, handicapped in business
relations with any* but > Chinese. And;
even with the latter, the man who has
"lost face" j with his -own \u25a0countrymen
is laboring under a disadvantage. "
In Hongkong the "club" is the grand
rendezvous of^ the business and social
world. There social -obligations are
paid, and much of the port's business is
transacted. There;th'e white man finds
refuge from the \multl-oolored swarm
on the' sun-baked streets and' mingles
with men of his own breed. If the white
man thirsts and meets a dry friendjrit
Is: "Let's to the club." It' is almost an
insult in Hongkong -to : invite; a man
into a saloon to take a drink. \u2666 If Amer
ican or Englishman wishes ? to talk
business with one of . his own kind, it is
"meet me at the [club at â -o'clock "and
we'll talk it over." ; From ".morning un
tllnight it is club,- club, club, and -the
man to whom the club doors "are barred
will find more social = glee^ on the Far
allones than in^HongkongT â -
LEAVES FOR" NEW POST.
Silverstone was: appointed agent at
Hongkong last March' to T succeed *E. W.
Tilden. His ' friends rejoiced . at ; this
recognition of years of faithful service,
and his associates, on the- seventh floor,
of the Merchants'- Exchange building,'
presented him with I a handsome , piece
of silver plate. ' R. ; P. â¢ Schwerln made
the presentation address 'and other
speeches, \u25a0to - the \ glory of Silverstone,
were, delivered.' \u25a0 '*.
The Chinese merchants of this \u25a0 city
banqueted the new Hongkong agent,
and on April. 18 a large numberfof
friends gathered on the Pacific Mall
wharf to bid Silverstone, this wife: and
three children a pleasant voyage- on
the liner. Manchuria.
Arrived at Hongkong, Silverstone re
ceived a cordial ; greeting /from, the
.American colony,; and i: as^ a matter . of
course his name was proposed for mem
bership In the Hongkong; Club. :; . With
tiro posting of his name he was free
to make use of the club as a guest. This
freedom did \u25a0* not ; Include the ,- privilege
of Inviting, outsiders to the club and on
this point the rules of the Hongkong
Club , are very emphatic.
Up to this point Silverstone waa all
right. He enjoyed life In Hongkong,
and wrote glowing letters to his friends
in this city of the generous hospitality
and ' good fellowship of - this -far-away
British colony. *' Then' .the letters
stopped. \u25a0.'\u25a0\u25a0: -'\u25a0- / : ;
