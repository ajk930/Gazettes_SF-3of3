A hard riin Tuesday night covered

posse which went out Wednesday has
returned unable to get any trace of the
perpetrators of the outrage. A number
of Indians from nearby ranches have
been out several days gathering cactus

are responsible for the killing and that
they are venting their wrath upon the
Mexicans who persist In deporting to
Yucatan all Yaquis suspicion*! of

at the Sangerman ranch, when, with

killing Albert Atlzlar. Jose Davlla and

Judge O. Wheeler of the Superior

While it is certain that Representa
tive E. S. Minor favors a subsidy, he
leans toward a more complicated appli
cation of the principle than Senator
Gallinger. From his questions yester
day it was manifest that he is in favor
of subsidies to be paid to mall-carrying
vessels out of the general funds of the
Government and to be paid to' other
vessels out of a special Federal
fund to be made up by , tonnage taxes
levied on all vessels, American includ
ed, the treaties .between' our Govern
ment and other Governments not for
bidding tonnage taxes on foreign 'Ves
sels if the same taxes be levied on
American ships.

Washington' indicates - a leaning, toward
subsidy, but it is apparent that he>ls
yet open to" conviction as to whether
to put the principle. Into practice di
rectly or through some modification of
the tariff that would have, at least the
oretically, the same effect.

rooms of the Chamber of Commerce.
Discriminating tariffs, tonnage tax,
free ships, extension of the postal
bounty, export bounty and aid of
American merchant vessels in a thou

keeping the national treasury and the
bank accounts of American manufac

NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â Wisconsin.
with Its prize of thirteen electoral
votes, was the subject of two impor
tant conferences to-day, one by Demo
cratic managers, who believe there 13
a chance to place the Badger State In
the Democratic column, and one by Re
publican leaders, who see some danger
of losing the State.
William F. Sheehan. chairman of the
new Democratic campaign committee,
had a long session with Edward C.

leading Democrat in the State. Wall
was just back from a visit to Judge

Wisconsin Is divided into three hos
tile camps. One is Democratic &nd
two are Republican.
There are two electoral and two
State tickets In the field, both backvd
by Republicans of prominence, and
each faction would rather see the Dem
ocrats win than have its foe triumph.
One faction is headed by Governor La
Follette, and he Is opposed by what
are known as the "Stalwarts," headed
by Senator John C. Spooner. Senator
Charles, Postmaster General Payne and
Representative Joseph W. Babcock.
who la chairman of the Republican
Congressional committee.
Payne came over from Washington
and met Senator Spooner and Repre
sentative Babcock by appointment.
They had a long conference over the
situation. The President Is by no
means In sympathy with the "Stal
warts," who took the bit in their teeth
in the Chicago convention and had the
La Follette delegates thrown out. He
had requested that the whole dispute
be left to the courts and that each
member of the two seta of delegates
be given one-half vote.
It is now suspected that the Presi
dent, through Payne, is bringing pres
sure to bear upon Spooner and Bab
cock with the view of getting the case
decided in the courts. If It be decided
in favor of La Follette, the other side
has promised to take down Its ticket.
Thus the electoral vote of Wisconsin
may be said to hang on a court deci
sion.

I would also advise them not to purchase any
thing which they cannot pay for in full at the
time of the purchase, as more men are ruined
by speculation than in any other way. - I also
advise them not to sign any note or bond, and
to lock well to all transfers of real estate and

Mystery is added to the case by the
finding of a bloody razor near where
Caccio was caught and the fact that
there was blood on the prisoner's hands.
Leonard was not cut, and, as Caccio
ran as soon as he fired the shot, the
police think there may have been an

TACOMA. Wash.. Aug. 4.â Rev. Mr.
Ryberg. pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church at Nome, is here en route
to Washington to urge upon President
Roosevelt to do something toward sav
ing the Eskimo population of Alaska.
He says: "Though they have saved
lives of hundreds of gold seekers, this
kind and childlike race is rapidly pass
ing away. Its members are meeting
a sad and undeserved fate. Shamefully
neglected by our Government and its
boasted civilization, the last chapter
of their history is being rapidly writ
ten in cruel characters of neglect, want,
disease and crime. If the Eskimo, likÂ©
our Indians, had killed hundreds of
white men. Uncle Sam would have
cared for them at great expense on
comfortable reservations."
Ryberg declares that the reserva
tions are unsuitable to Eskimos, but
that four tr> six colonies between Point
Barrow and the mouth of the Yukon
will solve the problem In two years.
With the help of rich Nome miners
Ryberg last winter purchased a road
house at Quartz Creek. Nome, and
helped the Eskimos build thirteen igloos
from logs hauled eight and ten miles.
The colony numbers a hundred and
this winter will Include two hundred.
A school is established and Ryberg
says the Eskimo will become self-sup
porting If the Government will furnish
each colony with a steam or gasoline
schooner of seventy-five tons with which
they can catch halibut, codfish, whales
and walrus. Each schooner should
clear $20,000 per year, enabling them to
repay the cost and supervision. The
reindeer furnished by the Government
benefit only fifty natives and Lapland
ers imported to drive them.

OTTAWA. Ont., Aug. 4.â A bill aimed
at American trusts, and particularly
American tobacco concerns, will be In
troduced in Parliament by Minister of
Revenue Brodeur.
Brodeur to-day presented a resolu
tion favoring the cancellation of excise
licenses held by manufacturers who sell
goods- subject to the condition that the
purchaser shall not sell or deal in goods
of a like kind produced by any other
manufacturer or dealer. The resolution
was adopted.
All independent tobacco companies
and dealers in Canada petitioned for
legislation along this line to prevent the
powerful American companies making
contracts with the retailers, with the
object of crushing out independent
companies.
The Minister said Canada would not
allow her industries to be crushed by
American trusts. There was little op
position to the resolution.

The official estimate of the loss of
than 1000 agrees with the figures
in a belated dispatch from Liaoyang,
referring to the same fighting, and
which says that the Russians were
fully prepared to hold their positions
when commanded to retire, the retreat
being carried out In perfect order.
The tropical heat continues and there
have been many sunstrokes.
The receipt of General Zassulitch's
dispatch was generally known to-day,
and gave rise to extravagant rumora
of further fighting around Haicheng,
and several press dispatches were sent
off describing a fresh battle between
the forces of General Zassulitch and
General Oku, where there Is no ap
parent justification for such reports.
The best informed military authorities
declare that there has been no fighting
since the Russians fell back to Lian
dlanslan, Anplng and Andhanshan.

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 5. â The
fact that there Is no further news
from the front beyond General Zassu

Simoucheng on July 31 bears out the
explanation that the Japanese are
halting to bring up supplies, especially
ammunition, of, which a modern en
gagement entails an extravagant use,
and without which it would be impos
sible even for a victorious army to fol
low up its success.

Arthur explains the presence of the

"Our attack in open order astonished
all beholders. Our men in this forma

cipal mountain range, rushing on both
sides with fixed bayonets upon the Jap

shock and quickly evacuated the three

Colonel Lepovatz to stop and push on

ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 5. â The
fact that General Kuropatkin's recent
dispatches have not mentioned Gen
eral Stakclberg or General Zaroubal
eff leads to the supposition that their
forces to the southward may have had
their communications cut by General
Nodzu's army.
LONDOX, Aug. 4.â The shipping
firm of Fred Holt & Co. announces
that owing to the uncertainty regard
ing what is lawful cargo the weekly
steamship service from London to
Japan will be suspended until further
notice.
"With the view of distracting the at
tention of the Japanese from our right
flank, I directed Colonel Lepovatz, at
5 o'clock, when the heat was dimin
ished, to order the soldiers to take off
their equipment and assume 'the of
fensive.
"To support this offensive movement
I* ordered our batteries to open a hot
lire on the ridges held by the Japanese.
The fire of our guns which had pre
viously bombarded this point was mur-
"Before this had occurred the Jap
anese had placed two more batteries on
the left of those which had previously
taken up their position there, and. with
their batteries on the extreme left, they
began to bombard our battery, as well
as to enfilade the right nank of our
formation. This was thd cause of the
destruction of our battery and the se
rious loss of troops on our right flank.
"The battery was shattered, but at
the beginning of the action we suc
ceeded In saving four guns, while four
others were left on the field disabled.
Of the four saved two had to be spiked
and abandoned, owing to lack of
horses.
"At 3:40 p. m. I received a report
that a regiment posted at the extreme
right flank had retired from Its posi
tion in the mountains, the Japanese
having turned its flank. Six disabled
guns were abandoned. Two officers
were killed and two wounded and the
commander of a battery was Injured.
RUSSIANS ABANDON GUNS.
"Simultaneously with the receipt of
this report, it was seen that our de
tachment had evacuated three crests
Â«jf the mountain range. It was evident
that Solomsky had too strong a force
to cope with and had been obliged to
give ground somewhat. He continued,
however, to hold his position. Â¦
"After reinforcing Solomsky with
two battalions and desiring to central
ize the eommai\d of these troops, I
dispatched Colonel Polovitch Lepovatz
with orders to take j command of all
troops engaged in that position.
"The fusillade continued on our right
flank without becoming threatening.
Our artillery continued to crush the
enemy's artillery with its fire, although
the Japanese had brought mountain
and field guns into action.
"At 1 o'clock I received the following
note from Colonel Solomsky: 'The
Japanese turning movement has
stopped, the enemy sustaining enor
mous losses. We have many wounded.
Captain Golitinisky was killed. The
wounded include two officers and a sur
geon. 1 am making a firm stand.'
"The beginning of the fighting showed
the superiority of our artillery over
that of the Japanese. Not only did our
batteries silence the Japanese guns
previously in position and prevent them
leaving their positions, but the bat
teries sustained no loss and were able
to develop their lire at leisure.
"Simultaneously with the attack on
the heights, the center of 'our position,
the Japanese directed attacks against
Major General Mistchenko's detach
ment, and again at our right flank.
JAPANESE GUNS SIL.EXCED.
"The battle began under the most fa
vorable auspices for us. The first re
port 1 received was from Lieutenant
Colonel Solomsky, who informed me
that he was tenaciously holding his
position, although he had many wound
ed. I ordered at first two companies
and then a battalion to reinforce him,
although he did not ask for support.
"From dawn until daybreak on July
Cl we heard cannonading on our right
flank, which obliged me to hurry down
to the south front, where, at first from
a battery and later from a range of
hills, 1 directed the course of the light

ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 4.â The
Emperor has received the following
dispatch from Lieutenant General Sak
haroff, dated August 3:
"Lieutenant General Zassulltch re

On the night of July 2S a truce was

The Russian fleet emerged from the
harbor July 26 and engaged Admiral
Togo, who withdrew to safety beyond
his mines. A Japanese gunboat struck
a mine and was damaged, but not suffi
ciently to sink her. She was towed
away. The Russian warships then re
tired, one squadron going to the inner
basin, the others behind the Tigers
Tall. None of them was injured.
NEWCHWANG, Aug. 4.â The Rus
sian troops at Port Arthur have been
driven back to ths last line of their
defenses. The Japanese attacking
force has 350 guns in action.
CHEFU. Aug. 4.â Twenty-one sur
vivors of the British steamship Hip
sang, which was sunk by a Russian
torpedo-boat in Pigeon Bay on July 16,
arrived here to-day on board the Ger
man steamship Sulberg. Among the?
survivors are three Europeans. They
say that the Wolf Hill fort was taken
by the Japanese army before Port Ar
thur on July 2S.
Â¦ When the Hipsang commenced to
sink, the Chinese on board rushed for
the boats and the Europeans were
compelled to swim. Finally they were
rescued by the torpedo-boat and were
confined until August 2 at Port Arthur,
when they were ordered to- leave In a
Junk, which was provided for them. '
S. A. Serebrlnlk, who was a passen
ger on the Hipsang and who waa
among the refugees who arrived here,
said that the fighting before Pcrrt Ar
thur from July 26 to July 2S inclusive
was directed against the last of the
outer defenses, namely. Wolfs. Green
and Christ hills, situated north and
east of the city. The Japanese cap
tured Wolfs and Green hills, but failed
to take Christ Hill, which was the
only outpost held by the Russians
when Serebrinik left Port Arthur.
A Port Arthur newspaper estimated
the Russian losses at 200 killed and
S00 wounded and the Japanese loss at
17.000 killed and wounded.
It was also estimated that tbe
Japanese fired 125.000 rounds of
shrapnel. The ground was covered
with broken shells.
The Russian infantry in triple
trenches defended its right tenaciously,
making a Japanese advance impossible
and causing: 400 casualties. The corre
spondent adds that the Russian losses
in this portion of tbe engagement were
small.'

over the Japanese guns, both in range
and weight, but 'V.is advantage the

Robert Dollar, president of the Dollar
Steamship Company, was the first to
address the commissipn at the after
noon session. He directed his address
to the expense of constructing and
maintaining American vessels. He
pointed out that it costs twice as much
to construct a steel ship in America as
it does in foreign^ yards. This is partly
due, he said, to the astounding fact that
American steel costs $8 a ton more at
FIGURES ON CONSTRUCTION.
Robert Dollar Furnishes Commission
Interesting Statistics.
A. Chesebrough submitted a paper,
which was read by the secretary of the
commission. The author pointed to the
deplorable decadence of the American
merchant marine and then to the won
derful growth of that of the Japanese
and the French. To the liberal subsidy
allowed by these last named govern
ments he attributed the success of
their efforts to control their portion of
the world's commerce.
In conclusion, he said that national
safety, national honor and national
strength rested on the merchant ma
rine and that If It was to be what it
once was the Government must lend
financial aid. He declared unequivo
cally against free ships, saying that
he favored home builders. .. Aa a rem
edy for existing conditions he strongly
advocated a general subsidy and a spe
cially liberal subsidy to those, vessels
so constructed that they can be con
verted into cruisers for the defense of
the nation.
A. L. Wilson, representing the Cali
fornia Harbor Association of Masters
and Pilots, spoke in favor of a general
subsidy on all classes of vessels, in
proportion to their tonnage. He also
suggested that a pension fund be es
tablished for the benefit of all sailors
that had served before the mast for a
period of more than twenty years, tha
fund to be raised through, the deduc
tion of a certain portion of the wages
paid all sailors on American vessels.
His suggestion caused Furuseth to
smile, for statistics show, that out of
the 17,00^ sailors that, have shipped
from this port in the last twenty years
but 37 had served the term suggested
by Wilson as the goal where labor
ends and the pension begins. -
Mr. Wilson -was the last witness of
the day. At the conclusion of hia
statement an adjournment was taken
until 10 o'clock this morning. It was
announced that R. p. Schwerin, pres
ident of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company; Captain I. E. Thayer and
other prominent men -will appear be
fore the commission at this morning's
session.
At the conclusion of yesterday after
noon's session Senator Gallinger said:
"We have received many good sug
gestions here. What we are after i3
facts, and we have been getting them.
We hope for more, however, because
the more we get the easier it r will be
for us to reach a conclusion "aÂ» to wb*Â»
Captain L. C. Robinson, shipping su
perintendent of the Shipowners* Asso
ciation, advanced a unique suggestion
for the benefit of the merchant marine.
He said he thousht conditions would
be bettered if each coast State would
establish a training school under Gov
ernment supervision and aid. This, he
said, would insure the training of men
that could always be called upon by
the Government to man its battleships
and cruisers in time of war. It would
further the policy to expand thÂ» navy
and would always keep in reserve men
that could be relied upon in time of
need.
Captain L. C. Robinson Advances Sug
gestion That Is Well Received.
TRAINING SCHOOL BROACHED.
Thirdâ Another idea is a system of tonnage
dues on all vessels engaged In the foreign
trade American as well as others. Let us
look for a moment at the operation of this
plan. At present about 0 per cent of the
foreign commerce is carried in American bot
toms Then 91 per cent of the fund to be
created from this source would, at the be
ginning be derived from foreign shipping.
This plan further provides that this fund
should be distributed to American ships en
g^ n /Â° re , iBn trade ' Â«^ r 'n8 on the P bÂ£" s
of a fixed rate per ton per mile. This should
â¢ . I 2 lre 2t ?â¢ a Â° tUal dIstan <* between ports,
not the distance sailed, else it will be open
to fraud. A\vessel would sail from San Fran
cisco to Shanghai going via Melbourne and
work up a pretty good mileage account It
would, of course, have a tendency to Increase
the percentage of American bottoms and reduce
the foreign, but that Is what we want But
it would not tend to increase the freight rates
beyond reason, because, were there too much
profit, foreign vessels could afford to pay the
tax and compete with our bottoms. What
Secondâ Another idea is that of postal sub
sidles for vessels carrying the malls. But
!w *<', Z ng Â« objectlon Â»Â« 8 against this plan
that it benefits only one class of our merchant
marine. It can be only the corporations that
are able to construct and operate several" large
and fast steamers, that can contract to rendea
sMvlce that would be acceptable. Hence they
only can be benefited, while the owners of
sailing vessels, to use a vulgar phrase, are not
ii it, and never can be until possibly a
trade has been built up that exceeds the
capacity of the steamship company Thev
must wait for the crumbs that may fall from
the rich man s table.
Firstâ A duty on all goods carried in for
eign bottoms. But this is open to the objec
tion that by the adoption of such a plan we
create a disturbing element among our treaties
with different foreign nations. We open a
Pandora's box from which we know not how
many evils mav escaDe.
If such, a course Is, deemed, advisable the
question arises -how rbÂ«t to raise the neces
sary funds. O^ the several plans that have
be-m proposed the two that seem to meet
with the moRt favor are:
George D. Gray, president of the Cal
ifornia and Oregon Coast Steamship
Company, which operates nine steam
ers and is Interested in other vessels,
was next called upon by the commis
sion to state his views. The general
tenor of his paper made for the sup
port of the subsidy measure under con
sideration. In part he said: '
What remedy can be found to meet the con
ditions that have resulted In the decadence
of our merchant marine? I know there has
been a great outcry against the subsidy idea,
but tho people should remember that for pro
tection the nation needs a merchant marina
from which it can draw transports and sup
ply vessels in time of war. as well as battle
ships and cruisers, and it is far cheaper to
have individual capital build and hold these
vessels in! readiness fop use when needed than
for the Government to construct and main
tain them. If individual capital cannot do
this advantaseously the Government can well
afford to assist.
George D. Gray Leans in Favor of a
Subsidy.
SCGGESTS A REMEDY.
It ts impossible for men that call before the
mast to marry. Their earnings are not suffl-
The picturesque portion of the morn-
Ing session of the commission was fol
lowed by Preston's exposition of the
advantages that would accrue through
the granting of a general subsidy.
Nicholas Jortall, a member, and An
drew Furuseth, secretary of the Coast
Sailors' Union, were called upon to lay
before the commission the grievances
of the men that sail before the mast.
Jortall launched right into his sub
ject and after" stating that the average,
time sailors serve in the merchant ma
rine is but two and one-half years and
that out of 17,000 sailors that have
sailed out of this port in a stated time
less than 5 per cent were American
born, he painted a picture of the hard
ships that confront the mariners, and
pointed to the better opportunities of
life on land. After filing a number of
documents that set forth in detail the
plaints of the sailors and suggesting a
remedy, Jortall gave way to Furuseth.
Addressing himself to the question of
the sailor's life and the small hope it
holds for a man, Furuseth said:
The conditions that prompt men to leave the
rea are as potent In their influence upon the
foreign as they are on the American sailor. It
is the improvement of conditions on shore that
lures men from the sea when they know that
conditions in their chosen calling are constant
ly growing worse. The wages of seamen,
when untouched by organization, stand in tha
fame place to-day they did in 1S70, thirty
four years ago. The wages of the men range,
in accordance with their position and the place
of destination of the vensel on which they sail
from $40 to Â»20 a month. It is Impossible for
men that follow the sea for a livelihood to
keep pace with thojf on shore, and the result
is that you find men that really prefer the sea
occupied oa shore in every kind of calling.
After lodging a strong complaint
against' the crimping system and ask
ing that legislation be enacted compel
ling owners of vessel to observe what
is known on the sea as "watch and
watch," service of ten and fourteen
hours, alternately, on and off, Furu
seth asked that the commission also
recommend a standard of efficiency for
sailors. Regarding this point, he said
in part:
There waÂ» no excuse for the enormous loss
cf life that occurred when the steamship Rio
de Janeiro went down. She struck within the
heads and ten minutes elapsed before she
plunged under the sea, carrying with her hun
dreds of human beings. Compared with this
disaster, that of the steamer Queen, which
took fire at sea, may be mentioned. The Rio
was manned by Chinese, the Queen by Ameri
can sailor3. When the Queen tock fire the
American seamen took off the passengers and
conquered the fire by methodical fighting The
loss of life in this case was small. The reason
was that Americans were in charge, not
Asiatics. It is in the Interest of human life
and the interest property that I ask that
this question be looked into.
Jortall and Furuseth of Union Tell of
Deplorable Conditions.
HARDSHIPS OF SAILORS.
W. H. Tibbetts, manager of the ship
ping department of C. A. Hooper &
Co., lumber merchants, next gave the
commission some sound advice as to
many small matters that may be looked
into for the benefit of the shipping In
terests in general. In part he said:
A few things of minor Importance suggest
themselves to me that I think would benefit
our merchant marine. These are not of very
serious nature, but in the aggregate cut quite
a figure In the expenses of operating vessels.
Taxes, in my opinion, should be abolished as
being unjust. Taxea are levied on property for
the purpose of paying for all city and State im
provements and for city and State protection.
Property situated on a street gets the benefit
of this tax in the way of street Improvements,
lighting, police and fire protection. With a
vessel It is different. From the time a vessel
arrives In harbor sha is subject to every ex
pense for service tendered. If it is necessary
to put a policeman on beard to protect the
vessel the policeman Is paid by the day by the
owners of the vessel.
All port charges are in the nature of a tax
and are of sufficient importance to offset any
tax that a vessel should be called on to pay.
Compulsory pilotage, as established by the
State. Is unjust. All of our vessels, when un
der a coasting license, are allowed to go In
and out of port without a pilot, but when a
vessel takes out a register under many of our
.State laws she is compelled to take a pilot or
pay half pilotage. It requires the same amount
cf skill In either case.
Tho United States Government should make
every effort to have all transportation by sea
between its outlying territory and the home
Government done In American vessels. It may
cost a little more freight money, but the money
stays in the hands of United States citizens,
who spend It at home. Money taken from
the United States Treasury and expended In
this manner is a benefit, as it puts more money
in circulation among our people and In time the
Government sets back its share of this money

the place of manufacture than it does
laid "down at the foreign shipbuilding
yards. The cost of operating American
vessels, he also asserted, is from xme
thlrd to one-half more than to operate
vessels under foreign flags.
In answer to questions put by Repre
sentative Minor, Mr. Dollar said that
he largely â¢ employed Chinese on his
ships, which he could do under foreign
registry, and from a standpoint of
peace he preferred the Oriental to the
Caucasian. He would be glad, how
ever, to employ American crews exclu
sively if laws could be enacted that
would permit the profitable operation
with such crews of the ships upon
which they were employed.
Mr. Dollar's next point was of great
Interest. He said that on all the seas
no tramp steamer of American registry
sailed. These tramp steamers, he ex
plained, were the drummers for trade
for England, Germany and France.
They touch at every port and their
masters compete for trade and estab
lish themselves. American tramp
steamers must sail the seas as the ar
gonauts to mark the coming of the
greater ships and fleets. Mr. Dollar's
logic won an affirmative nod from the
commission.
Tho principal export by sea from the Pacific
Coast In locally owned vessels Is lumber. Ex
perlence has plainly demonstrated that when
the foreign ship appears the freight on the
commodity becomes demoralized and declines
materially; and as every year more foreign
tonnage is dispatched to this coast than is
required to move our grain crop, the surplus
of this tonnage. In order that It may leave the
coast with cargo. Is offered for lumber at any
rate It can get. This condition, therefore. Is the
reason that the foreign ship is making to
day, as It has In the past, the rate of freight
for which our locally owned vessels have to
carry lumber to Australia, Africa. South Amer
ica, China and Japan; and this condition la
bound, to continue; but that it may not drive
our own vessels out altogether, let them have
an adenuate bounty on the commodities which
they carry abroad, thus enabling them to meet
competition and stay in the business of
transporting. our. coast productions.
At the conclusion â¢ of Mr. Pennell's
remarks an adjournment was taken
until 2 o'clock., The members of the
commission, as the guests of the Ship
owners' Association, then repaired to
the Pacific-Union Club, where they par
took of luncheon. There were no
speeches nor did formality in any way
mark the progress of the dinner. The
Commissioners were tired from their
morning's work, and they enjoyed the
relaxation of the hour or more of free
dom from "shop talk." It was 2:30
o'clock when the Commissioners and
their hosts returned' in automobiles to
the Chamber of Commerce and re
opened the hearing.
In the interest o f the American ship I pro
pose that the Federal Government shall pay a
bounty to the carrier amounting to $2 a
thousand feet on lumber, and ?1 60 a ton on
merchandise, on all lumber and merchandise
carried In American vessels, whether steam
or sail, bound from an American port to a
foreign port. ,
r believe that the payment to the American
ship of such a bounty as I have mentioned
would not only stimulate chipping and ship
ping interests, but also place our ships in an
Invulnerable position on the ocean; for, al
though the subsidy of the French and other
Governments has. undoubtedly been the means
by which our own producers have received re
munerative returns from their exports by sea,
it has also been a menace to American ship
ping property, by compelling our chips either
to operate at a loss to their owners, or to retire
from active service to await relief from our
Government.
H. E. Pennell, vice president of the
Shipowners' Association, whose ideas
were, more strongly developed as to the
benefits that would be derived through
the operation of an export bounty law,
was the next to offer his suggestions
to the commission. As he is an expert
on the question of lumber exportations,
Pennell used this produet and its rela
tion to the shipping industry as the
basis of his argument. In part he said:

J. J. Parker, representing: the Ameri
can Association of Licensed Officers of
Sailing Vessels, was called upon to ex
press his views. He said the organiza
tion of which he was a member strong
ly recommended that the present law
be amended so that all vessels between
700 tons, the present minimum size,
and 100 tons be compelled to carry two
licensed officers. Two hundred and
seventy-six of these vessels, he said,
now sail the Pacific and Ihe majority
of them carry but one licensed officer
capable of navigating the vessels. Sup
posing this lone navigator should be
come ill and die, he asked, what would
become of vessel and crew if no one on
board could read the sun and the
stars? They would be left to the
providence of God.
Representative Minor interrupted
and said that while he believed the
minimum should be placed much low
er, he was not sure that Congress
would be willing to place the figure
as low as 100 tons, as. such an act
would surely force many of the smaller
vessels out of business, the profit of
their operations not permitting the
employment cf two licensed officers.
Parker said he. would be willing to ac
cept a figure , higher than he * had
placed it if he had to. He asked for all
he would like to get, but would be con
sented with all he could get. . When
Parker made the suggestion that ship
masters be compelled to give all men
certificates of discharge, setting forth
their qualifications in order that such
certificates might be of aid to them in
time of need, Andrew Furuseth inter
rupted and said:
"This is a very bad plan. It was
tried by foreign countries and found
wanting, as"" tlie ship masters used the
law for purposes of blacklisting men
and it only .resulted in driving many
good men out of the service. The cer
tificates of many ship masters cannot
be depended upon and they hid many
an offense against their men by holding
over them the law that gave the mas
ters discretionary power to fix the
qualifications of men on such certifi
cates." Parker was forced to admit
that perhaps such conditions would
follow the enactment of the law he had
proposed.

late for them to make their way on shore and
become the heads of families, which all true
men want to have. Is It possible under these
conditions that men should remain in this
calling: when they are fit to do anything else?
After complaining against the treat
ment of sailors on many of the vessels
eo far as allowing them comfortable
quarters and messrooms in which to
enjoy their scanty meals, Furuseth
presented a series of photographs
showing the deplorable conditions un

Preston Tells How American Ship-
Ownerg Are Handicapped.
Mr. Rolph was thanked by the com
mission and he then gave way to E. F.
Preston, director of the Oceanic Steam
ship Company. Mr. Preston said that
at present the American shipowner
was laboring under three disadvan
tage?. The first was thÂ£* great cost of
construction of vessels in America, the
sedond the higher cost of operation and
third the subsidization of foreign ves
'eels -against which American ships
we're forced to compete. Continuing,
he said, among other things:
TllRKE DISADVANTAGES.
"I do not look for this depression in
the carrying business to continue. In
any event, had these ships that are ly
ing idle cost less money the fact stands
that less capital would be idle. It is
my opinion that the immense cost of
constructing vessels here is one of the
irincipal reasons for the decadence of
the American merchant marine.
In answer to Senator Gallinger's
question as to why the people were
Fj?eklng the right to purchase more
fchips abroad when many American
vessels are lying idle, Mr. Rolph said:
Owtng to the existence of international
treaties Congress may find Itself prohibited
fmn acting upon the reduction of tariff
charge* on goo<!s Imported in American ships.
End while I favor the merchant marine being
ievrtered by such an act. I realize that it
may be difficult at the present time to carry
It out. Thig leaves as the only alternative
a subsidy in pome form or other. Congress
thould niak* efforts to abrogate any treaties
that prohibit the application of a discrim
inating duty policy.
I .believe foreign vessels employed in trade
Between the United PtateÂ« ports and foreign
ports, other than between the United States
and their home ports, should be charged an
Increased tariff on all. their imports and ad
ditional port charges. These foreign sub*
t:dized vessels, with lew cost of maintenance,
ire too dangerous competitor* to our American
built ships and we must foster our American
tunnaee.
I am also strongly In favor of a reduction
ef ' import duties en all cargo Imported in
American built ves**ls. It it the idea of
giving the shipowner an opportunity of help-
Ing himself and the Government not paying
â¢omethlng for nothing. It gives the American
thip in foreign ports the preference of freights
to the extent of the rt-duction In the duty
and our American manufacturers and producers
are not injured in any way by such reduc
tion in duties." A reduction in the tariff on
Imports would enable tht shipowner to assist
the American manufacturer and producer In
tlie matter Â«f exports by enabling an Ameri
can ship, in competition with a foreign ship,
to accept a lower freight outward to the ex
tent of the rum earned on the reduction of
The duty on her Imports.
Foreign Governments which have the largeit
fleet* of merchant ships afloat allow their
subjects to purchase vÂ«e*ei6 abroad, so m-hy
.' iJeuy t-ur citizens the privilege of doing it?
This i* the only country In the world, I think,
- where this cannot be arne. Congress should
Verrait her American citizens to purchase, if
t hry . choose, foreign vessels and place them
i under The American flag; compel them to be
manned by American citizens, subject to our
inspection laws, registered in American ports,
'owned by American cltliens. but denied ab
solutely the privileges of the coastwise navi
gation laws.
Just think of practically 100 per cent dlf
Â¦ teTence between the coet of constructing a
.â¢ vessel in Great Britain and constructing her
In our American shipyards. How can wÂ«
.expect to get an American merchant marine
together under such conditions? The solution
of such a problem as this Is almost un
fathomable. Probably a reduction of duty on
imports -of steel would help the American
th'lpbuilders to a very large extent in the
reduction of their asking pricei for the build-
In* of ship*. *nd then they would probably
reduce them considerably more when they
realized that American capital had the op
portunity of purchasing foreign ships for
registrv under the American nag. even though
ienied the ccaÂ«ins privileges. Then for the
building of ehlps required to take care of our
" coasting trade they would probably try to
find a way of shaving off all corners and
ask a price within reason and make it an
inducement for American citizens to build
Arnerican ships.

"Then we must consider that your
prospective purchasers were merely
mythical men floating around In space,"
said Senator Gallinger dryly.
"I would rather it would be so than
to inconvenience these gentlemen,"
Todd retorted, and then left the room,
visibly ruffled.
"We have lost patience with collego
professors," Interrupted Senator Gal
linger. "In the East one of the most
learned college presidents recommended
that when all other supposed remedies
had been tried and failed the Govern
ment should remove the duty on all
products entering into the construction
of vessels. When he was Informed
that this had been done years ago his
stock in his own opinion went down
visibly. We don't want college theories.
We want facts from practical men.
and we would like to have you bring
before us those men that expressed
their willingness to purchase ships
representing a total of 100,000 tons."
"But why purchase these ships.**
questioned Representative Humphrey,
"when admittedly many American ships
are laid up here for want of cargoes to
handle?"
"Four years ago," answered Mr.
Todd. "there was great activity In ship
ping*. Again I can assure this commission
that this present idleness of ships Is not
specially significant. These ships will
not rot. Prosperity on the sea will soon
come again. And as to the many things
that have been said here regarding our

KTXGMAN, Ariz., Aug. 4.â More rain
fell in Truxton Canyon to-day, and
once more the temporary work put in
at the various bridges that recently
were washed out waa carried away and
traffic was delayed. Four passenger
trains east bound, which were held
here, have been turned back to San
Bernardino and will be sent East from
there over the Southern Pacific to Mar
icopa, Ariz., thence north to the Santa
Fe main line at Ash Fork. Rain ia fall
ing to-night and repair work has been
suspended until the downpour ceases,
as nothing can be accomplished until
the torrents of water rushing through
the canyon subside. It will cost a large
sum to put the track in its normal con
dition after the rainfall ceases. The
Santa Fe officials believe to-night they
will be able to get trains through in
side of twelve hours.

UKIAH. Aug. 4. â Passengers on the
Fort Bragg Lumber Company's road
were treated to a novel sight on
Wednesday. As the train bearing
Wlllits passengers was coming
through a deep cut a large panther
was noticed on the track ahead. The
engineer put on speed to try to
catch him. The panther watched the
approaching engine with mouth open
and Cashing eyes until it was within
a few feet of him. He then dashed
ahea'd, but as the train kept gaining
on him he apparently decided to risk
everything and. made a spring up the
precipitous side of the cut. It was
too much for him and, missing his
footing, he fell back and rolled under
the wheels, his head being cut com
pletely off. The engineer and fire
man have secured the hide and it will
adorn the cab as a testimonial of their
prowess.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 4.â Although
nearly one-fifth of a knot betow the
eighteen knots' speed required by the
Government, the battleship Ohio will
be accepted by the Navy Department.
The department to-day received the of
ficial fig-ures of the Ohio's trial off the
coast of California, in which the speed
is given as 17.S17 knots.
According to the contract the Gov
ernment had with the builders, the
Union Iron "Works, the latter must re
bate J13.300 from the regular contract
price, which was $2,839,000. The con
tract stated that $25,000 was to be re
bated for each quarter of a knot ihe
ship's sp*e<i fell below eighteen knots.
It is not believed that another trial
will be made, as the Ohio came up to
requirements in all other directions.
It was formerly the policy of the
Government to offer a bonus for speed
attained by ships contracted for over
and above the contract rate. Under
this custom the navy acquired a num
ber cf vessels like the New York and
ethers which exceeded their contract
speed. The Ohio is a sister ship to the
Maine and Missouri. The latter came
up ta the contract speed, but the Maine
was bÂ«?' rw and was only brought up by
allowances which were made because
seme cf the stakeboata were said to
have been out of line. It is believed
that the Government's experience with
these vessels may be sufficient to
cause them to re-establish the custom
cf giving a bonus.

Case.OAKLAND, Aug. 4.â One little girl
lies at the Fabiola Hospital very seri
ously burned; another little girl and
two young men' are nursing painful
burns received in trying to save the
life of the first little girl, and all be
cause coal oil was used to hurry along
the noonday meal.
Rosie Moskowitz, a 12-year-old maid,
was preparing luncheon at her home at
260 Fourth street, to-day. The fire
would not burn and the little girl was
anxious to have everything ready on
time for the other members of the fam"
ily. She hod recourse to the can of
kerosene that stood in the closet. The'
result was an explosion of the can and
the scattering of burning oil over the
house and the dress of the girl. The
dress caught fire in an instant of time
and Roeie was enveloped in flames.
The explosion was heard outside of
the house, and attracted.-attention. A
moment later the little girl ran into the
street, her clothing a mass of flames.
It did not need her cries to attract
several who were in the neighborhood.
The first one to rush bravely to her aid
was Rosie Weis, her little playmate
and companion. Though scarcely more
than 11 years 6t age the little Weis girl
showed herself to be a heroine, and she
bravely tried to beat out the flames
that were burning so fiercely around
Kayser was on a^ butcher's delivery
wagon, and he threw his coat about
the burning girl and tried to smother
the flames. As fast as he beat out
the- fire on one^ portion of the girl's
clothing they sprang out from another.
C. J. Renken, who lives near by, gave
aid, and finally extinguished the
flames. Dr. E. R. Jordan was called
and the girl was removed to Fabiola
Hospital. She is under the care of
Drs. Jordan and A. L. Cunningham.
She is seriously burned, but It is
thought that the injuries will not be
fatal.
Both Kayser, Renken and the little
Wels girl were burned in their efforts
to save the other girl. Kayser jumped
on" his delivery wagon and continued
his work, , and Renken busied himself
with securing medical^uld for others
before he thought of himself. Both of
them made light of their injuries and
their bravery, while the little .Weis girl
only says:
"When I saw Rosie on fire I did all
I could to put it out."
The father of the burned girl is Louis
Moskowitz. Her mc-ther is a bedridden
invalid and was in the house at the
time the fire occurred. The damage
to the house was slight.
her friend. Her fight would have
proved unavailing had it not been for
William Kayser and C. J. Renken.

ing of the City Council to-night as the
date for the bond election. On that
date the people will vote on a $2,500,

ments throughout the city. The Coun

well. The voting precincts\ in each

electors and not more* than 400. On
this basis the First Ward will have
seven precincts; the Second, seven pre
cints; the Third, seven precincts; the
Fourth, seven precincts; the Fifth, six
precincts; the Sixth, eight precincts;
the Seventh, eight precincts.

,1016 Broadway, Aug. 4.
N. A. Brown, resident agent In this
city of the Minnesota Mutual Life In
surance Company, was arrested in
Stockton yesterday on a charge of. em
bezzlement. He was brought here to
day and admitted to bail in the sum of
$2000. It is charged by W. C. Parsons,
the coast manager of the company, that
Brown collected $475 premium on a
$10,000 life insurance policy from Dr.
Frank L. Adams and failed to account
for this money to the company.
The warrant was issued for the ar
rest of Brown on Friday, but it was
only yesterday that the company suc
ceeded in finding him. As coon as his
whereabouts was known a telephone
message was sent by the District At
torney to Chief of Police Walker at
Stockton and fifteen minutes later an
answer was received saying that
Brown was under arrest.
It was some time before the transac
tion in regard* to the Adams policy
came to the knowledge of the company.
Dr. Adams paid the premium with a
note which Brown discounted at the
First National Bank and pocketed the
proceeds. The policy took its usual
course and it was only when the com
pany finally refused to take Adams as
a risk and he asked for the return of
his note that it was discovered no re
turn of it had been made.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,'
1016 Broadway, Aug. 4.
A valuable piece of water-front prop
erty at First and Webster streets, the
title to which has been in litigation for
twenty years, has finally passed into
the peaceful possession of Charles H.
liolbrook Jr. of San Francisco, "who has
purchased it from the litigants for $40,
400. The final order confirming the sale
of the property was made to-day by
Judge Melvin, and $2000 attorneys' fees
were allowed to Bishop. Wheeler '&
Iloeller for straightening out the. title.
J. B. Lanktree, referee in the matter,
receives $1010 for making the sale.
This piece of property was first occu
pied by James M. Dameron, a "squut
ter." in 1S46 and for more than fifty
years he held possession of It against
such powerful foes as C P. Huntington
and Leland Stanford. With Willard C.
Doane he established oyster beds -on
the land, which later became very val
uable, owing to the way the city built
around itÂ»* One part of the property
consists of the old wharf used by for
mer Mayor John L. Da vie while he was
conducting a ferry to San Francisco in
opposition to the Southern Pacific Com
pany. At one time Davie and "Old
Pard" Bassett had to defend their pos
see*ion with shotguns. Many attempts
were also made by the Oakland Water
Front Company to oust Dameron,
Doane, Davie and Bassett, but without
success.
Owing to options given on the land
and sales which fell through, the title
became so entangled that even after
the sale had been agreed upon, as was
said in court to-day, forty-four objec
tions were made to the title by the at
torneys for the Hibernia Bank. These
defects had to be remedied before the
lawyers would accept the title. The
property is now to be improved and
built upon. The old wharf will be re
built and tolls charged vessels for load
ing their cargoes.
The purchase price of $40,400 i3 to be
divided among nineteen different heirs
of Dameron and Doane.

Sheriff Curtis for S2000 damages for
removing furniture from his residence

Mrs. Esther Donaire, who has apart
ments at the St. Kathryn Hotel at
Ellis and Leavemvorth streets, com
plained to the police yesterday that
Ruth Brown, her stepsister, 16 yeara
of age, had kicked her till 3he was
black and blue. The girl, she said, had
rrcented beinjr chided for groins out at
nights with strange men. The girl
was arrested, as Mrs. Donaire wanted
her placed in some public instltufion,
but when she saw her in the matron's
room at the City Prison she almost
becarile hysterical and begged Captain
Duke to release her. He declined to
interfere and told her that Miss Brown
*vould have to appear before a Police
Judge this morning:.
Kicked by Her Stepsister.
Included in the $502,000,000 is the valu
ation of city property upon which no
taxes are paid. Then again there is
considerable non-assessable property,
such as that used entirely for church
purposes and also the property held
by the regents of the University, which
helped to swell the assessment roll, but
which under the law is non-taxable.
The assessment of this kind of prop
erty approximates 52,000,000, besides
that upon which taxes will be delin
quent.
Thus it is certain that the roll, in
stead of amounting to 5511.000,000, will
fall short of 5500.0000.000. but by how
much only further calculation will ac
curately determine. ;
The revision of the assessment roll, j
Â¦ Â¦ i
which has been under way ever since |
the Board of Equalization concluded .
its labors in hearing applications for I
the reduction of assessments, resulted !
yesterday In the startling discovery J
that the roll will fall considerably be- .
low the sum of 5511,000,000, which was |
originally returned by Assessor Dodge, j
From computations already made by j
those engaged in the work it has been J
ascertained that at least $3,000,0000 will j
have to be deducted from the total, <;
thus bringing it down to 5502.000,000. Of r
this sum about 52,500,000 is due to the j
reductions In assesments of individual >
property holdings ordered by the Board j
of Equalization on Dodge's reeommen- :
dations. The clerical errors already dls- j
covered in the roll aggregate nearly j
$6,500,000 additional. |
Even then ihe roll will in all likeli- j
hood fall below 5500.000.C00. the figure j
at which the Board of Supervisors es- j
timated the tax rate of $1 VI to pay the
expenditures of the municipal govern
ment. City officials are at the present j
time much alarmed lest the reduced as- j
sessment roll result in a deficit in the ,
budget appropriations.
Among the latest candidates for the
school directorship made .' vacant by
Mark's appointment to the prlnclpai
shlp of the Crocker Grammar School Js
Aaron Altmann, . present Park Com
missioner, and indications so far point
strongly to his selection for the office.
Altmann was recently appointed
head of the drawing department In the
Lowell High School. He is an artist of
ability and has at all times exhibited a
strong interest in educational matters.
The Mayor. is desirous of ascertain
ing the views of Directors Boyle,
Yv'alsh and Roncovieri relative to the
selection of the proper man to sit with
them in their deliberations, and it is
understood that no objection will be
made to the fitness of Altmann for the
position. The Board of Education has
been a uniformly harmonious body and
the Mayor wishes to appoint a man
who will not be a discordant element

The city is represented by John
Coughlin and Assistant City Attorney
John S. Partridge. M. B. Kellogg ap-
i.'nlted States Commissioner Heacoek
sat as a referee yesterday to take tes
timony in the suit of the Spring Val
ky Water Works to have the water
rate- ordinance declared unconstitu
tional and invalid. The whole of the
uay's session was occupied in the cx-
Wmination of Hermann Scliussler, chief
'engineer of the water company. He
told about his knowledge of the sub
ject in hnnd and of the thoroughness
of his training as a hydraulic engineer.
He gave the following interesting data:
:: la 3SG5 the individual consumption of
â¢water in th!s city was twenty gallons
per diem; in 16T0. forty gallons; in 1SS0,
'1. fly-four gallons; in 1SDC, sixty-eight
pal!ons, and In 1200. seventy-two gal
lons, the population appearing to grow
thirstier in proportion as it increased
in numbers.
Schussler made the following predic
lion as to the population of this city in
â¢the years named: In 1S10, 500,000; in
IL-CO, 650,000; in 1930, SOO.000; in 1940,
f-iO.000.' and in 1950, 1,100,000.
He also made the following estimate
rs to the daily individual consumption
-of water: In 1S10. eighty gallons; in
â¢ir2.0, eighty-five gallons; in 1930, ninety
gallons ; in 1940, ninety-five gallons, and
. in 1950, 100 jrallons.
Dry years and a succession of them,
hÂ» added, Bhould be also provided for.
Chief Engineer Schussler in answer
1o questions by Attorney Kellogg gave
a .detailed account of the distributing
system of the company and the loca
tion of its reservoirs and watersheds.
He said the comj.any purposes to cen
tralize its pumping plants at Lake
Mcreed and will then be able to force
water to the top of Twin Peaks if nec
essary.. Lack of funds has prevented
the company from doing this before, i
. He also explained in detail the inter
changeable system of pumps, which
assures the city adequate protection in
<zse of fire. For instance the water
can be shut off cither from the Ala-
TriP'Ja or Crystal Springs system or It
can be drawn from both at the same
Time. The city is divided into a num
ber of '"stories" and water is supplied
u\ the districts chiefly by gravity pres
sure. Overflow reservoirs are placed
at con\enient locations so that not a
drop may be lost and in case of con
t'agration the water may be drawn
irom one or all of these resevoirs with
â¢ .lit interfering with the regular sup
â¢yjy in their districts.

M. J. Ryan, a strapping fellow,
talked like a spellbinder in defense of
the conduct charged against him by
his father, who. resides at 709 Ten
nessee street. The father stated that
the son was an idler and a drunkard
and annoyed his parents by visiting
their dwelling and threatening to do
them bodily Injury if they refused to
supply him with money.
. "My father is laboring, under a de
lusion," Eaid the defendant to Judge
Cabaniss. "It was not with intent to
Injure those responsible for my being
that I called upon them, nor-dld I ex
ercise intimidation while in their
presence. My. heart was filled to over
flowing with filial love and I was suf
fering excruciating agony with an ab
scess In my head." "

King advertised for a housekeeper
and swindled the women who re
sponded by engaging them on the
spot, giving them checks for a month's
wages in advance and borrowing small
sums of money on the worthless se
curity. His victims are said to be
legion.
William King will have the peculiar
experience of serving eighteen months'
imprisonment within the period of
one year. JuJge Cabanisa pronounced
him guilty of obtaining money by
false pretenses from three servant
girls. Katie Andrews, Marie Keenk
and Hannah Johnson, and sentenced
him to six months in the County Jail
for each girl. But two of, the half
years will be served simultaneously â -
that is to say, Mr. King will serve
twelve months in six â and his total
term will he exactly one year, or ten
months if his conduct wins credits. v
Â¦ Blanche Blackwell, the wayward
minor daughter of Frank Frayne, an
ex-pugilist, was sent to the Juvenile
Court by Judge Conlan and her con
signment to the Magdalen Asylum is
a foregone conclusion.
George Hoffman, an employe of the
Union Iron Works, went to visit Mis:?
Xan Dale at her home on Tennessee
street last Tuesday afternoon and
there found her entertaining on-?
Charles Schollett. a benedict. Shocked
by Schollett's apparent marital infi
delity, Hoffman drew a pistol from his
pocket and threatened to make Mrs.
Schollctt a.widpw if her husband did
not immediately depart from the pres
ence of Miss Dale, Schollett depart
ed and n few moments later he re
turned with a policeman and had
Hoffman arrested and charged with
exhibiting a deadly weapon.
In Judge Cabaniss' court the case
was heard. Miss Dale, a comely
young person, corroborated Schollet's
accusation and Hoffman confessed
that he did have a pistol in his hand
when he commanded Schollett to exit.
The Judge is weighing the testimony.

Samuel J. Keyes, accused by his
wife of threatening to kill her, sent _
long letter to Judge. Conlan yesterday,
in which he set forth. his reasons for
following the woman from Philadel
phia to this city â reasons which were
based on love instead of on wrath. He
thought that her desire to get him
jailed was prompted by affection for
her first husband, from whom she w:\s
divorced and who is now apparently
supporting her and their two children.
Keyes has four motherless children in
Philadelphia, he says, and if he is not
allowed to return there they are like
ly to become public charges. "Vhe
Judge has the epistle under consider
ation.
Mrs. Crowley paid the fine and for
mally announced an intention of re
moving her personal belongings from
739 Folsom street as soon as she can
engage another apartment.
"These ladies and Mr. Montgomery
were spending a quiet evening with
me," she said, "and it's a nice thing,
ain't it, if a lady that pays her rent
regularly can't Invite her friends to
visit her without having them arrested
when they come. If there's any dam
ages to pay I'll pay 'em, for I have a
bank account."
"Glad to hear you say that, Mrs.
Crowley," the Judge remarked, "for
opulence seldom confesses itself In
this court. You have shown the ideal
hostess spirit by defending those who
were your guests last night, and I'll
discharge them and fine you $5. Your
ride In the patrol wagon was worth
that much money." \
Mrs. Klttie Crowley's informal
"growler" party was at Its apogee when
three policemen entered the chamber
without knocking and arrested all those
present for disturbing the peace. The
place was 73D Folsom street, a select
boarding-house managed by Mrs. Mary
Koster, and the time was 2: SO o'clock
yesterday morning. In Judge Cabanlss'
court Mrs. Xoster appeared as com
plainant against Mrs. Crowley and her
guests. Mre. Josephine Conklin, Mrs.
Annie Gibbons and Joseph Montgom
ery. The quartet of defendants pleaded
not guilty.
Mrs. Koster stated that her drastic
action was not hastily conceived or im
pulsively executed. Not until she had
vainly tried both suasion and threats
did she enlist police aid to quell the
hubbub in Mrs." Crowley's apartmentâ a
hubbub that made the night hideous for
all slumber wooers in the house. Mrs.
Crowley responded to one mild expos
tulation by smashing a washboard
against the door, which Mrs. Koster
held in her hand, and Mrs. Koster's
daughter, too, was rudely received
when she visited the room to file a pro
test. Far was it from Mrs. Koster's
desire to curb the social enjoyment, so
long as it did not interfere with the
comfo.rt of her other boarders, ' but
really Mrs. Crowley and her guest3 car
ried their hilarity to great excess. The
Iadie3 sang loudly and in discordance,
while Mr. Montgomery was kept busy
'"rushing the can" and ladling out its
contents.
Mrs. Crowley bravely lifted from the
shoulders of her guests all responsibil
ity for the alleged disturbance, and de
clared that if there was any peace
fracturingâwhich she would swear
there wasn'tâ s^e, and she alone, was
to blame for it.
Alphonse James, for whose abduc
tion an Anglo-Chinese of the name of
Jim Siam is on Judge Fritz's calendar,
failed to appear in court yesterday
when the case was called and it de
veloped that he had stolen $2 50 l'rora
his father, a restaurant cook, and dis
appeared. The case was continued
till next Tuesday. Alphonse is 14
years of age and he accused Jim of
kidnaping: and conveying- him to the
Alaska fisheries.

The peopleof San Francisco have at last received the
word of regularly authorized municipal officials that bur
theaters are absolutely safe from the hazard of fire and
of panic. This -assurance was delayed long enough for
us to presume that it- has been made' with deliberation.
Let us hope that sound judgment is also involved and
that we must not rest our faith of life, and limb upon a
promise not wisely given.
A CORRESPONDENT seems to have carelessly
read us on "Irrigation Fancies." ,We were ex
pressly repudiating the opinion of some of those
engaged in Federal irrigation, that, a miner's inch will
serve 500 acres of land. If it is' intended to store water
on the theory that an inch is capable of such duty, Â¦we
have said and repeat that loss bitter disappointment
will result. There. was no error in our editorial, and it
was simply an advance publication of the very state

Lord Cromer, who certainly yields
to no man In knowledge of the econ
omic needs of Egypt and the business
possibilities of great transportation
projtcts in Africa* is sure that while
a complete railroad line from Cape
Town to Cairo may not be wholly im
practicable as an engineering problem,
it ;. is out of the question financially
and commercially. The reason he
gives is simply that the cost of build
ing a railroad through the vast
swamps of the Nile Valley lying be
tween the fifth and tenth parallels of
north latitude would be far too great
to be justified as an investment, espe
cially when steamers on the river
might be substituted for a railroad at
a small fraction of the pecuniary out
lay. The part of the Nile which Lord
Cromer would make the permanent
connecting link between the southern
and the northern parts of Jlje proposed

Editor Callâ Dear Sir: Of the many
articles published in your newspaper
the matter that is of the most import
ance to wheat growers and millers
seems to be the lack of gluten in. the
California raised wheat, and also how
it may be remedied. '
Is it not probable that the practice
of farmers of burning off the stubble
each year has had much to do with de
priving the wheat of gluten, taking
from the land each year for thirty or
forty years, in succession, without
returning anything to the land In the
way of manure or other properties that
would in part recoup it for what has
been taken from it in the way of grain
and straw burn?
The fact Is that probably three-quar
ters of the grain raised in California
is produced by renters that have no
real abiding interest In the land, and
consequently will burn the straw and
stubble so that they need not be both
ered with it in plowing. Even some
farmers who own the land do not ob
ject to this burning, although they
know that they are actually robbing
posterity of its just dues.
One farmer once upon a time said to
me, "Posterity , has never done anything
for me, and I will do nothing for it."
I was .raised upon a farm in Central
New York, where it was the practice to
sow' gypsum upon all grain when grow
ing. In fact, we could hardly raise a
crop without it. I apprehend that there
Is no other way for farmers to -recoup
their land but to use gypsum or ma
nure or by allowing: their land to lie
idle and renew It with sheep or cattle.
The English have a saying that "the
track of a sheep is golden."

THE Congressional Merchant Marine Commission is
now in our city and busy collecting data upon the
present status of Pacific trade and the great oppor
tunities offered American commerce upon the Western
ocean. The commission is to report back to Congress
the results of its investigations both on this coast and
in the great shipping centers of the East and South.
Upon the result of its report and upon the recommenda
tions that it may make depends in great measure the
fortunes of the bill now before Congress providing for
the upbuilding of the American merchant marine.
While San Francisco, with its tremendous promise of
markets in the Far East, is vitally interested in the fate
of the ship subsidy bill, the issue of a revived merchant
marine is a national one and the interests to be affected
by its passage or defeat are national interests. Those
complacent ones in the great interior valleys for whom
the railroad represents t le only traffic carrier decry
governmental assistance for this almost extinct activity
as being wholly unnecessary and calculated to be sec
tional in its benefits. Do they pause to realize that every
dollar expended by the Government upon the revivifying
of our shipping industry will but add to the insurance
agai" * lack of prosperity for inland manufactories? If
the. or Cincinnati mill owner or iron founder
cares to look for a profitable market abroad let him
agree to the removal of the handicap we now suffer
under â that of a complete, monopoly of the " carrying
industry by foreign ships. *
The United Kingdom aids its shipping industry by an
nual subsidies amounting to $6,000,000; within the
week the House of Commons authorized the Govern
ment to guarantee to the Cunard steamship line $13,
000,000 to insure the construction of new vessels. In
fierce competition with Great Britain, Germany . pays
over $2,000,000 a year to maintain the stability of her
merchant marine. Last year France lent aid to her
shipping, industry by contributions through various chan
nels amounting to $7,000,000. Japan expended $3492,000.
Even Spain subsidized one line alone to the extent of
$1,629,000. Thus the tale runs and to balance it we have
this to show: at the present moment not a ship is under
contract in the United' States or being built for American
commerce on the seas.
For the present year Congress appropriated $96,000,
oco for the support of the navy; of that amount $31,
826,860 was allotted for ships under construction. By
acttlal count there are more officers and sailors in active
service on our ships of war than in the entire merchant
marine flying the stars and stripes. Yet the cry is that
we build up our navy that we may protect out flag on
the high seas. In 1861 when American clippers carried
65 per cent of our foreirai commerce this argument
was justified: when in 1903 less than eight per cent went
over seas in American bottoms, the sounding demand
loses some of its timbre. That bright jewel, consistency,
which is credited with a high place in our national
cluster of virtues, is wont to become a bit dim and foggy
at times.

To hark back to London, plans ere
already well advanced for several
rather important productions, which
will take place soon after George Alex
ander Bets the ball rolling with his
adaptation of "The Garden of Lies."
Perhaps the most Interesting of these
is the new play by W. W. Jacobs, the
story writer and author of "Many
Cargoes." This piece, which is called
"The Monkey's Paw," is the first dra
matic effort of its author, who has
chosen to collaborate with the tireless
Louis N. Parker. Cyril Maude will
produce the play, himself taking the
part of its hero a bargeman. Maude's
theater, the Haymarket, is to be in the
hands of the decorators for the next
few months, bo the Jacobs play will be
seen at Sir Charles Wyndham's "New
Theater," which is available owing to
its proprietor's coming visit to the
United States. Another of the more
promising :ning productions is
James Clarence Pagan's "Prayer of the
Sword," with which Ose .r Asche, who
was seen In America in "Iris," is to
make his "stellar debut."

reason has definitely ended, with the
result that eeekers after theatrical
novelties have been obliged to cross
the Channel to find them. Truth to
tell, there is little doing on the Paris
ian stace either, but In spite of the
heat the Comedie Francaise is being
crowded nightly to see "Le Paon" (The'
Peacock), by Francis de Croisset. He
Is only 2S. and thus has duplicated
Rostand's feat in having a play done
at the National Theater before reach-
Ing his thirtieth birthday. There is,
however, nothing immature about "Le
Paon," Jn fact, It is one of the best
constructed, most original and wittiest
ylays that Parisians have seen in many
a long day. Moreover, though charac
teristically French in manner it might
be an English comedy, so free is it
from anything like offense, a fact,
however, which has not made its wel
come here any less hearty. Written in
blank verse, its adaptation for the
English and American stage would ba
a matter of more than usual difficulty,
but otherwise should commend itself to
eome of the American managers who

Austin Dobson might have told "Le
Paon's" story. It takes its title from
the character of its hero, a human pea
cock in Parisian high society, fond of
fine clothes and the other adornments
which his wealth places within his
reach, but rather a good sort under
neath all his patches, powder and fur
belows. His feminine victims are le
fion, but his friends taunt him with
the insinuation that all his success as
a Lothario is due to his fine feathers
and his bank account. So Boursoufle
declares he will prove that he Is loved
for himself alone by going into the
country, laying siege to the heart of a
rustic damsel, who knows nothing of
his true station, and winning her af
fection. So In act 2 we find him at a
country inn and soon after see him,
ghorn of all his fine raiment, paying
court to Annette, a pretty girl who
lives on a nearby farm. Ere long her
conquest is complete, but then Bour
eoufie's friends appear on the scene,
and, though compelled to admit that
fce has been successful, challenge the
â¢dandy to bring the girl to Paris, believ
ing that her rustic awkwardness will
humiliate him unendurably. But when
Annette reaches Paris she surprises all
bands by instantly becoming the rage.
Suitors follow her about in droves and
for a while â having discovered .the, de
ception practiced on her by Boursoufle
â she encourages them, but in the end
marries the 'â¢Peacock," who is now her
absolute slave, and at the. play's end
seems by way of bringing cut the man
hood that there really is in him.

Education.
ST. PETERSBURG, with a pleasing complacency,
announces that the seizure of merchant ships and
the sinking of them is in accordance with the law of
Russia, and that therefore the conduct in that respect of
her naval officers is approved. This means that Russia
labors under the impression that her municipal regula
tions are the law of the sea. If they sanction the sink
ing of all neutral ships, food laden, found in the Pacific
or on the way to that ocean* Russia proposes to go on
sinking them, following the precedent she set in the case
of the Knight Commander and the Thea.
The Russian press is apparently surprised that any one
should object to this. There will be objections never
theless, for Russia's dream of achieving the primacy of
the world and dictating to other nations their laws and
manners and customs is still in the pipe and not yet in
the practice.
In the evolution of maritime law, for the protection of
all the sea-going nations, the tendency has been to put
the rights of person and property on the high seas under
the same judicial protection that is over both on land.
Our system of admiralty law is infused with principles
that grew up as the common law of the sea from the
time of the Phoenicians. It was further expanded and
enriched by the Wisby laws, a code that took form when
that ancient seat of commercial splendor was the center
of the world's trade. But it was not sufficient to have
maritime laws applicable to a time of peace only. So, in
the line of evolution, there arose^rize courts to which
ships taken at sea as the spoil of war must be taken that
the property they carried might have its day in court.
Japan has scrupulously observed the law of the sea by
taking her prizes into a prize court, where some of them
have been released as not subject to capture. Now Rus
sia assumes the right to sinka merchant ship on the high
seas, cargo and all, without resorting to the formality of
condemnation by a prize court, and St. Petersburg says
this is the law of Russia. It will be seen that it violates
evrfy principle of justice. The Russian naval com
mander takes upon himself to decide whether the cargo
is contraband. He adjudicates the whole case himself
and inflicts the penalty adjudged by sinking the ship.
It is true that there may be circumstances under which
it is lawful to destroy contraband in that way. If the
prize be unseaworthy in such extremity that she cannot
live to reach a prize court, or if the captor is unable to
put a prize crew aboard of her, it is permissible to de
stroy her. In such case the captor assumes the respon
sibility of proving that the facts existed to warrant his
action. But it is known that no such facts existed in the
case of any of the ships destroyed by Skrydloff s fleet.
They were seaworthy and he had plenty of men for prize
crews. Under such circumstances the act was wanton
piracy. The Knight Commander was on her way to
Singapore. She might have been loaded to the Plimsoll
line with arms and" ammunition for the Straits Settle
ments, but her cargo was not contraband if not consigned
to a belligerent.
The destruction of the ship under such circumstances
was mere piracy, for which Skrydloff and his officers, if
captured, mayÂ»be ; .hanged at the yardarm.
Among the assumptions of Russia is that she has
the right to say what is contraband of war. This can no.
more be conceded than the right to^sink merchantmen
without resorting to a prize court. She puts coal and
foodstuffs in ' the contraband list. International law
puts neither there except discriminatingly. During the
Boer war Lord Salisbury laid down the correct principle
to the effect that "Foodstuffs with a hostile destination
can be considered contraband of war only if they . are
supplied for the enemy's forces. It is not sufficient that
they are capable of being so used; it must be shown that
this w*as in fact their destination at the time of seizure."
Therefore foodstuffs, such as are consigned in ordinary
commerce for the use of non-combatants and not des
tined for armed forces in the actual zone of military
operations, are hot contraband. To this view the United
States assented. The same principle applies to coal and
other articles on the Russian list of contraband. It will
be seen that Lord Salisbury's definition is in the interest
of commercial rights and of civilized intercourse. The
Russian idea is reactionary and barbarous.
There is no necessity to appeal to the general prin
ciples of international law to expose the inability~of Rus
sia to set up for herself the law of the sea. In the Bering
Sea arbitration that question was the issue. Russia and
the United States claimed Bering Â§ea as a mare clau
sum, subject to the control only of their municipal lav?
within the jurisdiction of each. The Paris -arbitration
court consisted of Justice Harlan of our Supreme Court;
Lord Hannen, Lord of Appeal, Great Britain, with Baron
Alphonse de Courcel, a French Senator, as umpire.
They decided the question which Russia now assumes to
reopen and reverse. They held Bering Sea not a mare
clausum, but a part of the high seas, and therefore inca
pable of the municipal jurisdiction of any state. The
French member concurred with Lord Hannen in this
view. â¢ Later that decision was affirmed at the Hague
Court by Dr. Asser, and Russia was mulct in damages
for the seizure of American sealing ships under the pre
tense that they had violated her municipal law beyond
the three-mile limit from the shores of Bering Sea.
This decision is so recent that it is not necessary to go
searching ampng the general principles of international
law to find their application to Russia's preposterous
claim. The Paris and Hague arbitrations have done that
for us, and their decisions stamp Russia's position unten
able. This being so, her continued assertion erf authority
to say what is contraband and to sink merchantmen on
the high seas is piracy, no more, no less, and she is skirt
ing the edge of peril if she continue.
GARDEN, LONDON. July 22. â When
the Duchess of Manchester's^ present
chauffeur was before a magistrate a
few days ago for furious driving, his
fair employer put on her most inno
cent face and protested that she did
not encourage her drivers in their
wild escapades. Those who know her
best will not take her protestations
eeriously, for she is known to all her
friends and to almost every profes
sional motor driver in England as one
who is absolutely reckless about trav
eling at a high rate of speed. Al
though she has not yet obtained her
qualification certificate from her mo
tor school the Duchess is not afraid
to take her car in hand on a quiet
( country road and dash wildly along,
disregarding the presence of 'the pa
troling policeman. She is known
among the fashionable motoring fra
ternity as the "scorcher" and the driv
er who is not able to get the most out
of his car has no business in her es
tablishment. She pays the highest
\vage3 and must have the best man.
When her driver gets fined she pays
up and recompenses him for the dam
age he suffers through having his li
cense "indorsed." Her statement be
fore the magistrate that she has been
obliged to discharge several drivers
on account of the propensity for furi
ous driving is not literally correct.
The drivers leave after they have
been fined to protect themselves be
cause a second or third "indorsement"
en their license may mean its absolute
withdrawal by the police authorities
and then its erstwhile holder would
be obliged to seek some other occupa
tion. Discussing the. subject with the
writer, one of her late drivers said,
"We do not run the risk of getting
fined for the fun of the thing. A fa
vorite saying of her Grace is that she
has not discarded horses to drive
along by a slower method. 'Motors
are made to run, not to crawl,' she
shouted wrathfully to me one day as
I was driving along Piccadilly endeav
oring to negotiate some heavy traffic.
She is the most impatient woman that
I have ever driven. If she wants to
be in a certain place at a certain time
she expects you to do Impossibilities;
she would actually provoke you to
run over the housetops. I would not
drive her again for J5000 a year."
It Is only when the Duchess is ac

ing to break the hold of enthusiasts and theorists upon
the public mind.
Too many millions are to be spent on irrigation to
permit it to be made the vehicle of deception and the
cause of loss and disappointment. Eastern people who
come to get land in the irrigated districts are not wise
in the artificial use of water. They have been intoxi
cated by the ' flamboyant rhetoric used in certain per
sonal publications in Chicago. They too often conceive
that any kind of land and any quantity of water- brought
together will produce an Eden in a brief time.
It is necessary to undeceive them. Therefore we as
sert that nowhere in the arid region has a miners inch
of water ever served 500 acres of land. More than that,
we deny that it is capable of: that duty in any irrigated
region on earth. It would hardly amount to as much as
a heavy dew. Our correspondent, who evidently agrees
with us, will see therefore that we are both of the same
mind and working to the same purpose.

she promised to marry him. Then she
advertised for another husband, ac

ring, he said, and he wanted "dem
presents back."
He met her through a matrimonial
advertisement which she Inserted In a
local paper. They met; they loved;
they were engaged in about fifteen
minutes. Smith went merrily on his
way whistling the wedding march.
He met a friend. Smith told "him
why he was the joyful kid. The friend

industrious man to apply at the home

The charges that Gray Bros, were
favored by the present Board- of Pub
lic "Works were also taken up. This
Investigation was enlivened by lec
tures on the respective values of blue
and red rock by local quarrymen. The
accusation was that the board's speci
fications always called for blue rock
and that as Gray Bros*, owned the only
blue rock quarry they were benefited
by the exclusion of other contractors.
It was shown that the present city
administration is acting under an or
dinance parsed during James D. Phe
lan's first term as Mayor, which calls
for that species of rock. Further con
sideration of the matter was held over
until next week's meeting of the
Grand Jury.
. Thâ¬ Grand Jury investigated yester
day the charg-es of Marc' Au^enbllck.

Commissioners Reagan and Drinkhouse
of attempting to levy tribute in trade.
A lengthy session -was held. Commis
sioners HowelL Hutton and Reagan

will be resumed at the next meeting,
but it is not probable that the accused
officials will be indicted.

CASE OF COMMISSIONER
Skull May Be Fractured.
H. Lacroix, who lives at 1531% How
ard street, was thrown from a wagon,
yesterday at Second and Brannan
streets. In addition to concussion of
the brain and extensive abrasions of
the face and body it is thought that
his skull may be fractured. He is at
the Central Emergency Hospital.
Regarding the new directorate of the
North Shore road President Foster said
that he had simply chosen a number of
his friends to fill the positions on the
board., In placing his son in the posi
tion of second vice president the presi
dent of the two coast roads is .paving
the way for the young man to gain~"an
education in the railroad business.
The recent appointment of James I
Frazier to the position of general man- |
ager of the California Northwestern
Railroad gave rise to a report yester
day that he would soon be chosen aa
general manager of the North Shore I
road in place of Manager Rank, but
President Foster denied that any such
change was contemplated. It is probable
that the local ticket offices and the ac
counting departments will be consoli
dated as a matter of economy.
I havÂ» control of the North Shore and the j
California Northwestern roads. The lmpres- j
sion that Harriman has any say in their man- I
agement Is erroneous. I have simply acquired [
possession cf the North Shore line, believing j
that it is a good property, and I will do ray I
beat to improve It for the benefit of the terrl- !
tory through which it runs. I have never 1
worked for any man during my career In Call- !
foraia and I am not doing so at this late day. !
The roads of which I am now the head will :
be operated free from any outside influence, [
and you can state that each will have Indi
vidual management.
Of course seme corners will have to be
trimmed, but the officials of both roada need
have no anxiety regarding their positions.
Although it is generally thought
among the railroad and financial men
of this citv that the election of A. W.
Foster to the presidency of the North
Shore road is part of a plan of E. H.
Harriman to consolidate the two roads,
of which he is supposed to have recent
ly gained control, President Foster yes
terday afternoon emphatically denied
that Harriman has any interest in
either of the roads, and then added.
Having this day been elected president of
the North Shore Railroad Company, I desire to
say that I have assumed the duties of that
office and ask ycur co-operation to secure the
beat results for the stockholders of the com
pany and for the public.
In a formal way the control of the
North Shore road yesterday passed
from John Martin and his financial as
sociates to A. W. Foster, president of
the California Northwestern Railroad.
At a meeting held in the offices of the
North Shore on Market street at
11 o'clock yesterday morning President
Martin and the other directors of the
road resigned. Ten minutes later the
following new officials ware elected to
the newly created vacancies: Presi
dent, A. W. Foster; vice president, P.
N. LJlienthal; second vice president,
A. W. Foster Jr.; directorsâ E. Scott,
J. "W. Pew, James P. Bell, Wyatt H.
Allen, J. E. Doolittle and H. E. Bothin.
The latter director is the only one .of
the old directorate of the North Shore
road who was re-elected. Immediately
after the election President Foster is
sued a circular, in which he says:
A. W. Foster Is Chosen to
Succeed Martin as
Executive.
A. "W. FOSTER. WHO SUCCEEDS I
JOHN MARTIN AS PRESIDENT
OF NORTH SHORE ROAD. I
The consecration service was con
ducted by Miss M. E. Bowden and
Misses Rose Lamont. Violet Lamont
and Nellie Brace and Mrs. John Robin
son rendered vocal selections.
J. W. Hatch, president of the Golden
Gate â¢Christian Endeavor Union, an
nounced that the petition to raise the
saloon license from $84 to J500 had been
signed by almost 10,000, and 1000 signa
tures of that number came from the
Union Iron Works. Vice President
Ellis presided over the afternoon ses
sion and President Hatch directed the
evening meeting.
Miss Eflie E. Anderson and Jee Pond
Mooar contributed vocal selections,
and those to deliver addresses were
Mrs. J. Robinson, Harry C. Allen and
Miss Monte V. Webb.
The evening session saw still a
greater assemblage of members of the
union. A song service led by J. L.
Rogers opened the meeting, and the
Rev. W. J. Spear of Oakland delivered
an address embodying the principles of
the Christian Endeavor Society. Then
a handsome banner was presented the
Ocean View Congregational Church
Christian Endeavor Union for its large
percentage of members in attendance.
A nominating committee was elected,
consisting of Mrs. S. H. Robinson,
Presbyterian ; Sydney H. Youens, Bap
tist; Miss Ruby Reid, Christian
Church; James Irving, Methodist, and
Jesse Stephenson, Congregational.
Mrs. A. 8. Johnson, the recording
secretary, had an optimistic re
port, which she presented with no
little pride, and George O. Mattson, the
treasurer, had also a report which
pleased his audience. One of the inter
esting talks of what is being done by
the Endeavorers was contributed by
Miss Ida Stanford, who reviewed the
work of the committee which visits
seafaring men when in port, offering
them not only spiritual but material
and homelike comforts and welcome.
The Golden Gate Christian Endeavor
Union's seventieth quarterly conven
tion was held yesterday afternoon and
evening in the First Baptist Church
on Eddy street. It was a notable gath
ering, as to the numbers present,
the business transacted, the enthusi
asm and the sound addresses.
Out at the Irving Sanatorium, on Cal- I
ifornia street, an interesting experi- J
ment in skin grafting is being conduct- j
ed by Dr. Scott of McKittrick. | The :
operation is not a new one by any
means, but this is uncommon in two
respectsâ the cuticle being grafted on ,
the patient is voluntarily furnished by I
members of Willopa Tribe. No. 133, In
dependent Order of Red Men, and the v
space to be covered is greater than j
usual.
About two weeks ago H. Tuel, a f
workman employed at the MlKittrick \
oil wells, had the misfortune to be
caught under a fly wheel, which tore
the skin and flesh off his back from
shoulders to hips. Temporary treat- .
ment was given at the time and last j
Sunday he was brought to this city. â¢
The doctor announced that the onry
chance to save the Injured man's life
was to graft new, skin on the injured
portion of his body. Volunteers were ',
called for to give up sections of their
cuticle and members of the order j
named responded readily. ;
The work of grafting was begun â¢
Monday morning and has been contin- !
ued at intervals since. Small pieces of
skin usually about an inch square are
cut from the arms of the volunteers ,
and placed on the back of the patient,
where they readily knit. About 180
inches of skin will be required to cqpi
plete the operation. A number of
friends of the injured man will visit ,
the hospital Sunday morning and con- (
tribute of their skin to aid in his re- '
covery. So far the operation has been !
very successful and the patient is rest- ;
ing as easily as'could be expected un-j
der the circumstances.
Among those who have aided by '
parting with small portions of their i
persons were R. M. Parks. J. Watt, AI
pheus Duffee, P. Cunningham, C. Gros
bauer. P. Hughes, G. Allen, Jeremiah
O'Connor and J. Gigeau. ,
Blanche Blackwell is to be tried on
numerous charges in the Juvenile
Court. She will probably be sent to the
Magdalen Asylum.
Miss Marion Gellat, a waitress in the
Puritan restaurant, met Lizzie at a ;
dance at Scottish Hall a month ago.
A friendship sprang up between the
two girls andNvhen the dance was over
Lizzie ' accompanied Marion to her
home, at 240 Oak street. Lizzie's
clothes were somewhat ragged and
Miss Gellat loaned her everything to
wear but shoes -and hat. Last night
Miss Gfellat called at the Central sta
tion and told Sergeant Shaw that she
wanted her clothes back. "This Black
well girl skipped out with all my
things," said Miss Gellat. "Everything
she wears excepting her shoes and hat
is mine. I fitted her out with a tem
porary wardrobe."
Sergeant Shaw was puzzled to know
what Lizzie was going to do If she was
divested of the clothes she did not own.
Sam Rankin, the inner office man,
tendered his old coat, but It was de
cided that his donation would not Eerve
to envelop a portly form. Sergeant
Shaw said that if Miss Gellat would
only wait until this morning he would
brintr down some of his servant girl's
clothes, so that Lizzie might not ap
pear in the nude with a "skj piece"
and Ehces.
After a good deal of engineering and
strategy on the part of Sergeant Shaw
and Policeman Rankin, with the as
sistance of Policeman Maurice Behan.
the matter was laid over for a day and
respectfully referred to Chief Wlttman.
"Give me my coat, anyway." said
Miss Gellat, when informed that she
would have to wait until other wearing
apparel could be obtained for Blanche's
form.
Lizzie Frayne, alias Blanche Black
well and other names, has another com
plainant agairiÂ«t her. The female thief
did a rushing Dullness before the police
got. her. Since her arrest Tuesday
night, not less than twenty people
have come to the front alleging that
the female burglar and petty larcenist
had robbed them of various articles of
value.

i FIBROID TUMORS CURED. Â«
Mrs. Hares* First Letter Appeal-
ing: to Mrs. Pinkham for Help :
" Dear Mrs. Piskham : â I have been
under Boston doctors' treatment for a
long time without any relief. They
tell me I have a fibroid tumor. I can-
not sit down without great pain, and
the soreness extends up my spine. I
have bearing-down pains both back
and front. My abdomen is swollen,
and I hare had flowing spells for three
years. My appetite is not good. I can-
not walk "or be on^ my feet for any
length of time.
"The symptoms of Fibroid "Tumor
given in your little book accurately
describe my case, so I write to you for
advice." â (Signed) IIes. E. F. Hates, I
252 Dudley St. (Roxbury), Boston, Mass.
Mrs. Hayes* Second Letter :
"Deab Mrs. Petkham: â Sometime
ago I wrote to you describing ray symp-
toms and asked your advice. You re-
plied, and I followed all your direc-
tions carefully, and to-day I am a well
woman.
"The use of Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound entirely ex-
pelled the tumor and strengthened my
whole system. I can walk miles now.
"Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound is worth" fire dol-
lars a drop. I advise all women who
are afflicted with tumors or female
trouble of any kind to give it a faithful
trial." â (Signed) Mus. E. F. Hates,

At the time of his death Mr. Storn
was the owner of a small string of
racers. He disposed of some horses
recently, the lot including Horatius.
He owned a large ranch near Vaca
ville, where his wife ' resides. Mr.
Storn was a prominent Mason and the
funeral services will be conducted by
that order.
He . was employed by some of the
most famous-, turfmen in the country
while in the training business and was
considered one of thÂ« best conditioners
of horses on the turf. Several years
ago Mr. Storn blossomed out as an
owner and many fast ones carried hi3
colors.
He was especially well known
throughout this State, having spent
many years in and about San Fran
cisco. He first achieved prominence
here as an owner of many fast run
ners at the old Bay District track. He
owned Del Norte, Topgallant and a
number of others, all prominent in
the turf world.
Matthew Storn, known and admired
as a trainer and an owner of famous
thoroughbreds, passed away last night
at the Central Emergency Hospital,
where he was removed from the resi
dence of A. D. Porter, 129 Taylor
street. Mr. Storn had been ill for a
long time with cancer of the stomach
and his death was not entirely unex
pected.
The dead horseman was a native of
Ireland and about 50 years old at the
time of his death. He started his
career on the track as a jockey and
achieved fame in the saddle on the
Eastern tracks many years ago. When
he became too heavy to ride he turned
his. talents to training horses and he
fitted many a great steed for rich.^
stakes.

PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 4.â In addi
tion to hitting like a National Leaguer
to-day, with a triple and a two-bag
ger, Iberg pitched a great game of
baseball. In only the third and fourth
innings was anything that resembled
a safe hit made off him. Before and
after these two innings the Tigers
were as tame as so many kittens. Dur
ing the game Iberg issued only two
passes and the one he gave in the
ninth, coupled with Castro's error,
made the only period of the game In
which the visitors were dangerous.
The score:
In Addition to Pitching Great Ball He
Gets Two Long Hits.

Active steps were taken last night
toward perfecting arrangements for the
proposed athletic meet and bicycle
races to be held at Ingleslde racetrack
on the 21st, inst. for the benefit of the
proposed new speedway and athletic
amphitheater in Golden Gate Park, for
which the athletes and horsemen are
raising funds.
Committees representing the Pacific
Athletic Association, Golden Gate Park
and San Francisco driving clubs and
the California Associated Cyclists were
present and the matter was discussed.
The programme will be a varied one,
and it is expected that all the promi
nent cyclists and athletes in the city
will compete. It will consist of a 100
yard dash, 220-yard dash and 440-yard
run, open to all amateurs, and a half
mile relay race, four-man teams, open
to the students of the various grammar
schools of the city. All entries must be
sent to George James at the Olympic
Club by the 17th inst.
The bicycle races will form an impor
tant part of the programme. They will
be made up of a mile race, ten-mile re
lay race for teams of five men, mile
sprint race, two-mile club race, three
mile tandem race, three-mile motor cy
cle race and. a two-mile handicap.
The two driving clubs will probably
arrange one or twer trotting races as
part of the programme, but this has
not b*een definitely settled. The ath
letic events will be held under the aus
pices of the Pacific Athletic Association
and the, bicycle races will be sanctioned
by the California Associated Cyclists.
Ransch is a native of Bakersfleld, in
this State, and made a big name for
himself while in the employ of Burns &

best previous record.

VICHY, France, Aug. 4.â Jockey Jay
Ransoh, the famou- American rider,
who was injured in a race at the track
here yesterday, is dying. He is suffer
ing from concussion of tfce brain and
his condition to-day is so low that the
attending physicians have practically
abandoned hope.
ltansch is "one of the most popular
American boys riding in France and
the accident that has befallen him is
universally regretted. During his ca
reer on the turf Eansch has accumu
lated a comfortable little fortune and
he has often spoken of retiring from
the turf at the expiration of his pres
ent contract. ?;-?
Jack Munroe is beginning to show
the effects of his training already and
is fast rounding into great shape.
Yesterday afternoon he took on Andy
Gallagher, Harry Chester and Twin
Sullivan, boxing five fast rounds in all,
besides going through his usual gym
nasium stunts. A large crowd was
present and applauded the miner
every time he put in a stiff punch.

JAY RANSCH. A CALIFORNIA
JOCKEY OF NOTE, WHO IS RE
PORTED DYING.
HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 4.âCham
pion Jeffries is fairly launched on his
course of training and from now until
the eve*of his battle with Munroe he
will put forth every effort to place
i himself in the best physical condition
I possible. The big Â¦ feljow waited until
i the cocl of the evening before work
j ing in the gym yesterday. He spent a
strenuous hour at work and finished in
good> shape.
It was a revelation to the spectators
to see him work with the bag. It seems
with each successive battle the big
fellow develops more speed. He enjoys
working with the sandbag and handles
the 350 pounds of sand with no effort.
Jeff retired early after a bath and
rubdown and arose early this morn
ing. He never looked in better health
and will be in condition to put up the
battle of his life.
Jeffries received information last
evening that several deer had been
seen a few miles below the springs.
He spent some time endeavoring to
locate the game, but met with disap
pointment.
Work in the gym was taken up again
this morning. Jeff will commence box
ing In a day or so with Joe Kennedy
and Brother Jack, and his work with
the mitts will be watched with in
terest.
Training under any circumstances is
is irksome, but Jeff takes great inter
est in his work and has been in par
ticularly good humor. Several well
known sporting men are expected
here this week.

â¢Batted for Buchanan tn ninth.
RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
Then, as" usual, the Oaklands quit
badly. San Francisco started in again
in the seventh ere Buchanan had a
chance to warm up, and two more runs
came in quickly. Knell was seized with
a new lease of life after his team mates
rallied, and there was nothing to it but
defeat for Oakland.
In order to make it a sure victory
Captain Irwin ousted Swain from the
game in the seventh and put Hilde
brand at short, Leahy behind the bat
and Gorton out in left field. The score:
An ordinary bush ball team could
beat Uncle Hank's collection, but Oak
land never had a chance lo turn the
trick yesterday at Recreation Park.
They can maintain all kinds of leads
for a few innings, but it always breaks
up in about the sixth or seventh. The
big thing was pulled off yesterday in
the sixth, and Oakland, as usual, was
down and out. Score, 6 to 4.
The Commuters had the lead, 3 to 0,
when the sixth opened.. Then Hilde
brand beat out a dinky hit'and Meany
walked. Schmidt threw three wide
ones to Townsend and then suddenly
quit the box, complaining of a sore
wing. Buchanan was brought in with
a cold arm and immediately passed Cy.
Then the big rough house happened.
Irwin drove a liner to left, scoring Hil
debrand and Meany. Anderson shot one
at Francks and Buck fumbled, letting
Townsend arrive. Gorton shoved a hot
one through the infield and the last one
came in, making it 4 to 3 in Uncle's
favor. Â«

Only Pimple Ishlana opposed
Beldame, the latter of course being at

CHICAGO. Aug. 4.â Harlem's feature
event, the Youngster Stakes, furnished
a complete upset to-day in the victory
of C. R. Ellison's John Smuleki at a
long price. He won a nose victory over
the added starter, The Mist, also at
long odds. lx)retta M was third, while
Kurtzmann, the crack Cook .colt and
favorite for the stake, was Just outside
of the money. The stake was worth
$3490 to the mrlnnejr. It was a stirring
finish and a popular victory, as Jockey
Henry, who was reinstated yesterday,
had the mount on the winner.
He rode a brilliant race. He dodged
the hot pace and then saved ground by
coming through on the rail at the turn
for home. With a wonderful burst of
speed the colt got up just in time to
nip the Mist by the shortest kind of
a nose. Two and a half lengths back
of The Mist was Loretta M. a neck
in front of Kurtzmann. .â¢? -i

Shipping Intelligence.
The mystery of the floating pine lumber
through which the French ship Duchesse do
Berry passed has been solved. It was part of
the deckload of the schooner Maria E. Smith,
hound from Port Ludlow for Guayaquil. The
Smith put Into Mazatlan yesterday with main
and mtzzen masts gone, her hull water-logged
and no deckload. She encountered the hurri
cane through which the Duchesse . de Berry
passed. The Duchesse weathered the storm in
good shape, but the Smith emerged from the
conflict much the woree for wear and floating
only by the grace of her buoyant cargo. The
schooner, which Is a vessel of 347 tons register
and Is managed by George E. Billings of this
city, may be condemned. She was built in
1681 at Port Blakeley.
The Maria E. Smith in Trouble.
The steam echooner Cella on Wednesday
evening saved seven members of the crew of
the French ship Duche3se de Berry from drift
ing to 6ea in a water-logged ship's boat. The
French tailormen had started to row ashore in
a boat the seams of which the sun's rays had
robbed of calking. There was a strong tide
running and when the boat began to leak the
water poured in faster than all hands could
bail it out. Rowing was out of the question
and there was no sail in the boat, so the eeven
sailors just bailed and balled, while the tide
swept the leaking craft seaward. When the
Celia. intervened the water In the ship's boat
was within a few Inches cf the gunwale and
6even different kinds of fear had found lodg
ment In the hearts of the sailors seven. Tha
Cclia landed the men at the Main-street wharf.

A suit for $75,000 for libel was
commenced yesterday against U. A.
Crothers by G. F. Gray and II. N.
Gray, doing business as Gray Bros.,
which is based upon an article which
appeared in the local columns of th*
Bulletin on July 30 last.
Gray Bros, are contractors and fur
nish the city with rock for use in
street improvement. The articl; cf
which they complain was headed
"Grand Jury After Grafters." Other
portions of the heading stated thjt
the Board of Public Works was par
tial to Gray Bros.' "blue rock"; that
Gray Bros, owned all of the blue race
and that the Board of Public Works
forbade contractors using a better and
cheaper red rock, and that a phemi. J t
had found tht tho red rock stood a
5000 test and the blue rock only 4000.
The plaintiffs aver that the article
meant to convey the impression that
Gray Bros, had committed dishonest
acts and were liable to be indictei bv
the Grand Jury. They say that the
statements were "false, scandalous
and unprivileged."

The Macdonough Estate Company
and Richard H. Warfield, former les
see of the California Hotel, have en
tered into a controversy over the mat
ter of Warfield's responsibility for
damage to the house and its contents
during his tenancy and. according to
papers filed yesterday in the County
Clerk's office, both sides have agreed
to submit the differences to William
S. Miller for settlement.
Warfield leased the hotel on March
1, 1899, and his term of proprietorship
expired on March 31 of this year. For
the whole period the rent was to be
$81,000. or $1350 a month. After the
expiration of the lease and the deliv
ery of the property to the Macdon
ough estate Warfield tendered all nf
the glass, china and plated ware and
kitchen utensils, but the estate com
pany refused to accept them on the
ground that they were unfit for US9
in a hotel 1; the California.
Besides this the question arose as
to Warfield's liability for damage to
the furniture, carpets, walls, wood
work, etc., and Warfield disclaimed
any liability further than for 578 35,
which he paid. The other damages al
leged go into the propositions for set
tlement by the arbitrator.

Captain Carty. which arrived here yes
terday from New York, encountered
terrific weather off Coronel and brings
v.ord of the awful havoc by the storm
on all kinds of property at the South
American port.
The Oregonian reached Coronel July
12 and left there July 13. Two days be
fore her arrival and for five days after
resuming her voyage the storm raged
with fearful fury and any vessel of
smaller dimension and less solid con
struction than the Oregonian would
have been in grave danger.
At Coronel buildings were blown
down, railroad tracks washed away
and all telegraphic or other communi
cation destroyed. As far as Captain
Carty could learn there was no serious
damage to shipping. This same storm
swept over Valparaiso with disastrous
results to life and property.
The Oregonian's voyage otherwise
was uneventful.

The matter in issue was the Inquest
into the cause of death of Frans John
son, who was killed in the Marine Hos
pital by being given bichloride of mer
cury by mistake for sulphate of mag
nesia on July 17. Miss Stella Willey
was the nurse who made the mistake,
and she had been placed under $2000
bonds by Police Judge Fritz pending
her examination for manslaughter. The
Coroner's speech to the Jury had its
effect, for a verdict was rendered of
accidental death, without any. censure
upon the nurse or the management of
the hospital.
Coroner Leland yesterday morning,
in presence of a jury, severely criti
cized the Police Courts of this city for
the management of certain criminal
cases. He said in substance:
We find that the police court takes a very
serious view of this case. Nurses risk their
lives daily for the good of their patients. .They
work for the love of doins: good. We all Know
that these same courts make no examination
Into and Immediately discharge cases of crim
inal abortion and men who fracture other men's
skulls. They Uke no cosrnizance whatever of
many things which were matters of life and
death, and even the thue and men with the
very worst of motives meet with a leniency
which a trained nurse working with the very
best of motives could hardly expect to receive.

It was further agreed that the Tuol
umne County Water Company should
pay Nevills and his associates 40 per
cent of the net proceeds of the sale of
power and light to parties other than
Neviils and his associates. It was
agreed that the amount due by Neviils
and his associates for water and elec
tric power furnished" should be credited
upon the indebtedness until the whole
amount of $150,000, with interest, should
be paid. It was alleged that these cred
its reduced the amount due by the de
fendant to $141,165, and that the de
fendant has refused to pay the 40 per
cent of net profits as agreed.
The trial of the case of the Rawhide

to recover $150,000 and possession of an
electric light, power and water plant
on the ground in violation of contract
and under a conditional bill of sale.
Stanton L. Carter, Marsha!! B.' Wood

the plaintiff and Wheaton & Kalloeh
for the defendants.
The complaint alleges that on March
9, 18SS. Captain W. A. Neviils. W. H.

ten agreement v/ith the Tuolumne

Power Company an electric liÂ£ht, pow

In October, 1900, there occurred the
famous union of the Tree church of
Scotland with the United Presbyterian
church. Twenty-four free church min
isters opposed the union, and through
the Scotch courts and the House of
Lords have fought their claim to the
whole property of â¢ the free church.
The courts rejected their claim, but
the House of Lords, by a majority of
two, reversed, that judgment and ren
dered a decision which \ places in the
hands of these twenty-four ministers,
a majority of whom belong to small
Gaelic congregations in the highlands,
funds amounting to more than $5,000,
000 and property comprising over 1000
churches and manses throughout Scot
land valued at nearly $50,000,000.

BUt we have not reached the high
writer mark yet. David Boyle, who for
twenty-seven years had been identified
with big trees. In 18S9 wrote to the
Melbourne Argus, giving 525 feet as
the height of a tree known to him
some years previously. As this was
considered rather "tall" and is, I be
lieve, the greatest height in or out of
Australia claimed for a tree, Mr.
Boyle replied to inquirers: "I deter
piined to have it photographed and
measured, ten years having elapsed
since I measured it before. â¢ â¢â¢ â¢
I found it. The tree was healthy, the
only change in it since I saw it last
being that a portion of the top was
blown away. The measurement now
is 466 feet high, and Its circumfer
ence' four feet from the ground 81
feet; base, 114 feet"
. Visitors to the Melbourne Interna
tional exhibition in 18S8 will rcmera
oer the photographs of a large butted
turn tree by N. J. Caire, photographer,
TALLEST OF THEM ALL.
' Another contemporary account says
that W. G. Robinson of Berwick, Vic
toria, in a Journey from Gippsland to
Mount Baw Baw, saw and measured
a tree 500 feet high. Later, in an edi
tion of the "Select Extra Tropical
Plants." the name of the finder and the
heights arc varied. "G. W. Robertson,
surveyor, measured a tree at the foot
of Mount Baw Baw 471 feet high."
. We will go a step higher. In 1SS9 F.
SanJpy Dobson of Melbourne quoted
Mueller as having written in his "Bo
tfcttlc Teachings" that our gum trees
attain a height of 500 feet. I cannot
trace this particular reference, but I
have other references of such a height
to which Mueller gave currency. For
example, in Seemann's Journal of Bot
any he Bays that George XV. Robinson,
â¢in the back ranges of Berwick, found a
tree 81 feet in girth four feet from the
ground, and supposes that toward the
sources of the Yarra and Latrobe riv
ers it attains 500 feet.
On another occasion he continues to
limit the height to about 400 feet. "In
our sheltered springy forest glens at
taining not rarely a height of over 400
feet." In 1S62 he. in Seemann's Journal
of Botany, said that E. B. Heyne meas
ured a tree at the Dandenong 295 feet
to first branch, diameter at first branch,
4 fc-et. To the point where broken off.
TO feet; total 365 feet. Diameter at frac
ture. 3 feet: girth of stem three feet
from the ground, 41 feet. Although not
up to the 400-foot standard, this Is a
vÂ»ry big tree, and I am sorry that we
have not evidence which would war
rant our accepting it. In fact, those
â¢â¢!d records are simply unreliable, in
tpite of their apparent attention to de
tails.
Â¦'messmate' and "peppermint" (it va
ries much in the bark), and Mueller al
ludes to it as the "tallest tree on the
globe, surpassing even the renowned
â¢California sequoia and Wellington
pines in height, reaching to 400 feet and
even more."
Another tree measured at the base
of the stem 69 feet in circumference; at
twelve feet from the ground. 14 feet in
diameter; at seventy-eight feet, 9 feet;
Ht 1H feet, 8 feet in diameter, and at
210 feet. 5 feet. All these trees belong
to the species described by Mueller as
eucalyptus regnans on account of Its
crowning height. It is the tree known
in Victoria variously as "white gum,"
Hcnniker Hcatoa says that on
the Blacks Sour were two trees, one
alive, measuring 420 feet In length, and
the other (prostrated) 4S0 feet- long. He
adds that Baron Mueller Is the author
ity' for these measurements. One ver
sion, therefore, states that the 420 feet
tree is srostratc and the other that it
â¢is alive. If these two statements are
correct then two trees of this stupen
dous height are referred to. Following
la another account of the 480-foot tree:
A note by Mueller in. the Gardeners*
Chronicle for 1862 savs that several
jrees had been recently measured at
the upp^r Yarra and on the Dande
norg. He adds:
"The highest known Is ascertained
to be 4S0 feet, and therefore as high as
*vÂ» great pyramid." The same writer
.11 Seamann's Journal of Botany says
that it was a Mr. Klein who measured
a tree on the Blacks Spur, ten miles
from Healsville. who found it to be 4S0
feet high. Mueller in his "Select Extra
Tropical Plants" writes that a tree
was measured in the Cape Otway
range 415 feet high and 15 feet in diam
eter.
Â¦ The greatest claims for Australian
trees have, been made on behalf of
Victoria, most of them from Gippsland.
In 1S62 Mueller wrote to Scamann's
Journal of Botany that D. Boyle of
Nunawading, near Melbourne, had
measured a fallen tree in the recesses
of the Dandenong and found it to be
420 feet. About the same time he
wrote to the Australasian, giving more
details about this tree, which was
'stated to be 392 feet long. He added
thiitv feet as a fair estimate of the
ier.rth o* the top, whoich had been
broken off. and thus we have 420 feet
'&a the height of this tree.
' . TWO ENORMOUS TREES.
It is very difficult for some people to
understand that in a question of this
kind only actual measurements by
tape or theodolite or records by an ob
server of proved accuracy can be ad
mitted. The mere guessing of heights is
rarely attended with even approxima
te to accuracy. I have been given
the most astounding heights for cer
tain trees and when 1 have asked for
evidence I have sometimes given of
fenee.
"A great many tales about Australia
vegetation have, from time to time,
become current only to become demol
ished as the continent became better
known. But there is one phase of the
subject that is of real scientific inter
estâI allude to the size of our trees,
and in regard to these we have still
much to learn.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 4. â The brilliant prospect
J for th<Â» cotton crop as revealed by yesterday's
publication of the Government estimates was
the dominant Influence In the stock market
to-day, but thUi v.aoed somewhat in the course
of the cession. This was partly due to the
suggestive steadiness of the price of cotton
itself, which served to arouse misgivings of
damage to the crop since the date of the Gov
ernment estimate and partly to the excited
movement which develops! in tho wheat mar
ket. The latter waa due to the recelDt of
alarmist rrports from the Northwest as to the
extent of the damage to the spring wheat,
which 6erve<i to offset the promise of the cot
ton crcc Very little pressure to eell stocks
was developed, but a marked indisposition to
make speculative commitments resulted In a
running down of the rate of activity to near
the rolnt of idleness. It Is- not likely that
conSdence in the harvesting of a bumper cot
ton crop will be injj>aired except by much
more decisive indication!? of a deterioration
than were rresEnted jto-day. But the decline
In estimates of the wheat crcp detracts from
the prospective advantage of an unusually
good foreign demand. Belief in poor foreign
crop prospect* plays a large part in the pres
ent sirenirth cf wheat, but the amount of the
exportable i>urplus shrinks materially with
the later estimates of our wheat croo. It is
very notable, also, that foreign demand for
wheat is not Inclined to follow the market to
the higher wice levels here. The upward
bound in wheat quickly affected the etock
market, and that and the disposition to take
profits affected the cotton stocks as well. The
report of a large purchase of pig iron led to
some realizing in the Iron and BteÂ«i stocks.
The fact that the dividend will be deducted
from United Etatea Steel preferred on Satur
day eerved to recall the heavy selling which
followed the deduction of the last dividend,
and rave an uncertain tone to that Influential
etock. Some depression waa caused by Â¦ - the
apparently authorized admUaion that the ef
forts to arrange for the 1 distribution of the
amounts of the dividends to which Northern
Securities stockholder* are entitled haÂ» been
abandoned. The labor trouble In the local
building trades kent attention alive to ! that
branch of the industrial Â«Ituation. Sterling
exchange drot>Ded away from the gold export
point. The weekly statement of the Bank of
England, however, ebowed that institution- to
be etill losing gold, and the eame is true of
the Bank of France.
The expectation of additional borrowinc by
the Government stiffened thÂ« London market
again. The closing was inanimate, but fairly
Iffrty

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
There was nothing new worthy of not* on
tho exchanges, trading being light all around.
The Presidio and Ferries Railroad Company
has declared a regular monthly dividend of
20 cents per share, payab'e August 15.
The Alaska Packers' Association has Â£Â¦â¢
clared a regular monthly dividend of $1 per
share, payable August 12. Of the total pack
this year it is estimated that the association
will have 50 per cent, against about 38 per
cent last year. This places tha association la
a strong position, as the shortage in this year" a
pack indicates good prices for the new pack.
The White Pine Copper Company of Robin
son District. Nev\, has levied an assessment
of 20 cents per share, delinquent September 2.
The United Verde Copper Company recently
paid a dividend of 75 cents per share, which
is the fifth dividend of this amount this cal
endar year, making disbursements to stock
holders $1,125,000 In 19O4.

holders of the Merchants" Exchange Bank of
San Francisco (in liquidation) the following
directors were re-elected: Edward Coleman.
J. C. Coleman, J. H. Neff, Nicholas Ohlandt,

also eays they are overdrawn.
The Chicago wires of R. Brent Mitchell yes
terday said:
"Market about ' 3c per bushel higher. It
closed at the outside price for the day. The
oppning was a little ' easier, but as the day
advanced the unfavorable crop advices from
the Northwest kept coming, and this was the
keynote of. the market. These reports are
coming mainly from South Dakota. Southern
Minnesota and Northern Iowa, but the whole
Northwest Wheat crop, while in portions so
far looking well, is late. If there were nor
mal conditions in the "Wheat situation outside
of this, some of the damage, it would seem,
would not be such an urgent Influence, but
it is in the way of the last straw. European
crops are very largely deficient, our winter
Wheat crop extremely short and our surplus
practically exhausted. All this makes the
1 statistical position out of which the speculator
can easily 'see the* Possibility of an extremely
high range of prices. The advance has been
a large one. nearly 20c per bushel, but when
one reflects that tho low point for .contract
1 Wheat in this marke since the February ad
\ vance and a point that was made on fine
\ prospects for the entire crop waa only about
02c, the price does not Look so high. With
the present tendency of advices- we must still
advise the purchase of Wheat on sharp re
actions." - . . â¢ .-..'â¢ .
* In this market futures were again higher,
but there was - less . excitement than' during
the ptst several days, as this market did not
share the fevsrlshnesa of Chicago. The cash

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market continued firm and active
and, although all of the river boats were late,
the market cleaned up well on the wharves.
There Is no longer any movement to the South
west, as prices of desirable stock are too high
to admit of profitable shipping. Fancy Sa
linas Burbanks were in good requeet and occa
sional sales of small parcels were reported at
$1 75 per cental. Onions continued to drag
and prices had a further decline.
Tomatoes cleaned up better than for some
little while back, but supplies were still heavy
and prices showed no improvement. Green
Corn was still In excessive supply a^pd eold
at a wide range as to district and quality.
Carried -over lots of poor stock were offering
freely at 25o per sack, but found few buyers.
Lima Beans were plentiful and lower, while
String Beans were practically unsalable. There
were heavy receipts of . other Vegetables, a
large portion of which came in late, and prices
were without variance.

It was a very pleasant home wed
ding at which Miss Celia Tobin of this
city yesterday became the wife of
Charles W. Clark. The bride is the sec
ond daughter of Mrs. Mary Tobin, 1021
California street. The groom is the eld
est son of Senator Clark, the multi
millionaire mine owner of Montana.
In accordance with the wishes of the
young persons most interested, as well
as of the relatives of Mrs. Clark, the
wedding was wholly without ostenta
tion and every feature was marked
with the utmost simplicity. This was
in perfect keeping with Miss Celia To
bin's quiet tastes.
The city clocks marked the meridian
hour when the bridal party took their
places In the rose-decorated parlor be
fore the famous copy of Murillo's mas
terpiece, the Madonna, from the Prado
gallery in Madrid. Archbishop Mont
gomery, assisted by Vicar General
Prendergast, spoke the words and re
ceived the responses that united Charles
Clark and Celia Tobin in matrimony.
R. N. Tobin acted as best man, while
After the wedding breakfast Mr. and
Mrs. Clark left l^y special train for San
Mateo, where they will make their
home at the place which was purchased
from Walter Hobart some time ago.
Mrs. Clark is an accomplished mem
ber" of San Francisco society, is an ex
cellent whip and rides as well as her
brothers. She was born in the
Joseph and Cyril Tobin were the ush
ers. Miss Agnes Tobin, a sister, was
the maid of honor. The others who
witnessed the ceremony were Judge R.
J. Tobin, Mrs. Joseph Tobin, Clement
Tobin and Miss Charlotte Russell, the
fiancee of Clement Tobin. Miss Ethel
Barrymore, who is the guest of Mrs.
Joseph Tobin at Callstoga, was also
present.'
The bride wore a beautiful robe elab
orately trimmed in duchesse and point
lace, the wedding gift of her mother.
Among the other presents were a dia
mond crescent from Judge Tobin and a
diamond cross from R. N. Tobin. The
bride wore a sparkling diamond and
turquoise ring, the gift of her sister
Agnes. She carried a magnificent bou
quet "of orchids.
Five hundred Republicans of the
Thirty-sixth Assembly District met last
night at Harmony Hall for the purpose
of ratifying the national ticket and to
denounce the methods of A. Ruef. Bit
ter words were also forthcoming for
the former district leader, Charles H.
Truman.
Supervisor Fred Eggers occupied the
platform for nearly an hour and round
ly scored the action of a reputed Re
publican, who, he said, had boasted
after election that he had made the
election of a labor "man possible by
"throwing down" the Republicans. Eg
gers said that such a man was a trait
or and should not have the support of
a good Republican, a good Democrat
or a good Union Labor man. He then
went on to answer the charges of his
enemies that he had voted with the
Democrats on questions before the
Board of Supervisors. Eggers said that
be had voted with the Democrats on
several occasions when he saw that by
so doing he could best care for the in
terests of his constituents and the good
of the city. H. N. Beatty was in the
chair and Eugene Pfaeffle acted as sec
retary.
Neutral observers hold that Gavin
McNab is well informed regarding the
plans and movements of the opposi
tion. In the line of political general
ship McNab has no superior in Califor
nia. He is resourceful, energetic and
extremely adroit. Many a time his
opponents have been defeated when
they were certain of success. McNab
has a way of bringing up unexpected
reserves at the proper time. At the
recent organization of the new Demo
cratic State Central Committee the
Hearst forces were so confident of
triumph that they boldly proclaimed
M. F. Cochrane as the victor In the
fight for chairmanship, but unrecorded
proxies secretly held by McNab won
the' victory for Timothy Spellacy of
Kern. Next Tuesday McNab may
bring forward elements of strength
now cleverly concealed. The contest
next Tuesday may put the Democrats
in the lead, so far as party voting
strength at the primary election
counts. The Republicans, however,
will poll a large vote, although con
tests will not be waged in more than
four or five Assembly districts. The
Republicans claim that they will poll
many more votes than will be cast
for either the Democrats or Union
Labor party.

Jim O'Brien was responsible for Wil
liam T. Jeter's candidacy at Santa
Cruz in opposition to Frank Gould, the
candidate of McNab, Lane and Geary,
and O'Brien is now supported by the
Hearst faction of the party in the local
fight against McNab. In the corral of
the "Horses and Carts" It is claimed
that many of the former supporters of
the Union Labor party will join the
Democratic insurgents next Tuesday.
In other camps it is asserted that the
voters of the labor party will stand by
the ticket which the Schmitz-Egan
county committee has filed with the
Registrar of Voters.
The regulars of the Democratic party
are not apparently disturbed or alarmed
by the demonstrations of O'Brien. They
claim that the influence of Recorder
Godchaux, Public Administrator Hynes,
Sheriff Curtis, Assessor Dodge and
Coroner Leland will give strength to
the organization. The Assessor is not
in town, but the deputies, clerks and
attaches of his department are here.
Michael Casey, who would perhaps be
willing to help O'Brien, is in the East.
The "Horses and Carts" may get a
little assistance from Republicans con
nected with the Harbor Commission,
the postofflce and the United States
revenue office. The old machine Re
publicans are inclined to reward the
Hearst wing of the Democratic party
for past favors. Charles Wesley Reed,
John J. .Barrett and Charles J.' Heg
gerty entertain the belief that O'Brien
will win out in a majority of the As
sembly districts. It is noted that
O'Brien meets many of the party work
ers from the several districts of the
city, and when election day comes
O'BKIEX'S SUPPORT.
The regulars of the Democratic or
ganization, under the leadership of
Gavin McNab, and the Insurgent forces
of the Democratic League, under
James H. O'Brien, will fight at the pri
mary election polls next Tuesday for
the control of the local nominating
convention of the party. O'Brien and
his followers will not pay special at
tention to the contest for delegates to
the State Convention at Santa Cruz,
because a victory won in San Francisco
would not overcome McNab's superior
strength and complete organization In
the interior.
The local convention will nominate
four candidates for the Superior bench,
also six candidates for the State Sen
ate and eighteen for the Assembly. The
patronage at stake is hardly sufficient
to justify an organized fight all along
the line. Resentments growing out df
the May convention of Democrats at
Santa Cruz cause a deal of bitterness
in the camp. In that convention Mc-
Nab outgeneraled the lieutenants of
Hearst In the election of Frank Gould
as chairman and thereby secured the
appointment of the Executive- Commit
tee, which subsequently gave McNab
control of the new Democratic State
Central Committee. Former Governor
James H. Budd freely made the asser
tion at the time of Gould's election
that Tarpey lost the battle by failing
to make a fight in San Francisco for
the delegates to the convention. It was
argued that McNab was allowed to go
his own way without opposition in any
Assembly district of. the city and thus
perpetuate his control of party affairs.
It was very clearly shown at Santa
Cruz that McNab was quite willing
Hearst should win the delegates to the
National convention, but he was never
theless firm in his purpose to defeat
any effort on the part of Hearst to or
ganize the State Convention.
A man's alleged perfidy is set forth
blackly In the complaint filed yesterday j
in the Superior Court by Ellen L.
White against Mack Lovelace and his .
â¢wife Sarah. If Mrs. White is able to .
prove her charges she will be richer by
many thousands of dollars.
The plaintiff is the wife of Captain
M. White. Before her marriage and ;
removal to Seattle she lived at Le
raoore. Kings County. There, when un
used to the ways of the business world,
she found herself the owner of build
ings occupied by a general merchandise
store, with a business which had been
carried on for many years. In Novem
ber, 1891, Ehe entered into a copartner-:
hip with Mack Lovelace, whereby she
waÂ» to furnish all of the capital in the
way of merchandise and Lovelace was
to give all of his time and attention to
the business as raanager. They Â¦were
to Ehare the profits. On December 12,
1903, this partnership was dissolved.
Mrs. White now demands an account
ing, a restitution of her property and
Â¦a haif interest In Kings ' County landj
which she says Lovelace has boughr
and Improved out of the proceeds of
the business.
She declares that during the partner
ship from 3 891 to 1903 the profits have
been $60,000 or more, but she has not
received more than $300 a year as her
share. Since 1S95 Lovelace is said to
have represented falsely that the busi- 1
ness was not paying and was largely
.in debt. He refused to make an ac
counting and gave her a "mere pit
tance of $25 a month" from the re
ceipts. In truth, she says, he was re
ceiving large profits and investing them
in outside deals in his own name. She
did not discover this fraud until June
of this year.
Mrs. "White avers that in November,
1903, discouraged and dissatisfied with
her small income from the business,
she went from Seattle to Lemoore to
find out what the trouble was. She
was ill for six weeks before she had a
chance to make an investigation, and
when she was recovering, by false rep
resentations that the business was in.
