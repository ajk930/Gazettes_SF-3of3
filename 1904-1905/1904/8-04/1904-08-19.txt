saying that the gunboats Maya and
Amaji; which were on guard duty in
the neighborhood of Shampoingtao on
August 11, discovered the Russian
gunboat Giliak and another gunboat
near Shensen engaged in shelling the
Japanese land forces. The Japanese
vessels attacked the enemy and a shell
from the Amajl hit the Giliak. The
latter retreated hastily to Port Arthur.

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 18.â With
the knowledge brought by the dis
patches jj published, this afternoon that
General Stoessel had refused the final
Japanese request to surrender, the
Russians accept, with characteristic
fortitude and' inborn fatalism, the fact
that the last act of the elege of Port
Arthur has commenced.
All seem agreed that the fortress will
fall, but are unanimous In their ex
pressions that the enemy will be made
to , pay dearly for his victory. I hear
much discontent expressed that,
whereas the sinking of the Rurik took
place last Saturday, it was announced
here for the first time to-day. But
this Is nothing new. Little is known
here, as a rule, of the war news until
it is four days old, when the European
edition of the Herald and London
papers arrive. The intelligent classes
complain of this condition of affairs.
The loss of the Rurik comes as a
terrible blow, but is mitigated by the
news that the Rossia and the Gromo
boi have returned to Vladivostok. The
Russ, in a sensible article, remarks:
"It is seven days since the naval
battle. We know comparatively noth
ing. If a treat disaster has befallen
our fleet, it is surely known. Admiral
Togo's reports of losses in men are
serious for a sea battle. The return of
our squadron to Port Arthur is un
confirmed."

CHEFU, Aug. 10.â News of the
terrific fighting at Port Arthur on
August 14, 15 and 17 was brought to
this port by two junks, one of which
left Port Arthur only last night and
was carried across at high speed by a
gale. On this junk, concealed in the
baggage of some Chinese, was a Rus
sian, who may have been the bearer
of important dispatches.
The position that the Japanese oc
cupy on Liaoshan Peninsula is not
clear, but numerous Chinese sources
aver that the Japanese have been
seen in force in that section. Appar
ently a cruising attack, originating in
Louisa Bay, swept through the
Pigeon Bay positions into the penin
sula in the doing of which a majority
of the soldiers of the expedition were
sacrificed.
On the night of the 15th the battle
lulled somewhat, when the Japanese
sent terms of surrender to Lieutenant
General Stoessel. The terms pro
vided that the garrison should march
out with the honors of war and join
General Kuropatkin; that all civilians
be brought to a place designated by
the Japanese admiral; that the Rus
sian warships in the harbor â the bat
tleships Retzivan, Sevastopol, Po
bieda, Peresviet and Poltava, the
armored cruiser Bayar, the protected
cruiser Pallada and twelve or more
torpedo-boat destroyers and four
gunboats be surrendered to the Jap
anese.
Lieutenant General Stoessel is al
leged to have received the terms with
a burst of wonderful profanity, his
habitual taciturnity deserting him.
He "strode the floor until he became
calmer and then remarked that if the
Japanese proposition was a joke it
was in bad taste.
General Stoessel'a treatment of the
Japanese major was courteous, but
his reply was prompt arid character
istic. *
The Japanese major then asked for
Sped^l Dispatch to Th* Call.
The Russian refugees express con
fidence that the fortress will hold
out: They say that reinforcements
from Â¦ General . Kuropatkin are ex
pected within a > fortnight.
The refugees further say that- -the"
warships now, at Port Arthur are
still in fighting, trim.- This statement
seems hardly credible in the light of
recent developments. .

The battle was renewed at io
o'clock on the morning of the 17th,
and as the junk left it was being
waged furiously on all sides.

torpedo-boat destroyers entered the
harbor at 5:30 o'clock this morning.
They remained a' half hour and then
departed. Five other destroyers are
reported to be outside. Chinese Ad

the Japanese destroyers are searching
for Russian ships.

from plunging through a burning j

Young Nickerson was walking home [

Valparaiso. The boy often makes this Â¦

railroad track. Yesterday when he :

was in flames. He knew that the
southbound passenger on the Union
Pacific had not passed and that by
haste he might prevent a catastrophe, i
When young Nickerson breathlessly j
told of the danger, trainmen had to run j
a handcar on the trat-k and make a
race back to head off the train. The I
whistling of the locomotive was audi- j
ble before they reached the bridge, j
Two men climbed off to run across the
draw. Another stayed on the car,
driving it at full speed across the
bridge where the flames were leaping
high. The crossing was made success
fully. The rumbling of the express was
distinct as the handcar rounded the
curve between the train and the bridge.
At the sight of the danger flag the
engineer brought his train to a stop,
almost on the approach to the bridge.

"WASHINGTON, Aug. IS.â The re
port was going around Washington to
day that Chairman Taggart. when he
visited Esopus last week, astonished
Judge Parker by failing to promise
more than 20% electoral votes for the
Democratic candidate. This is thirty
one short of the majority required for
aa election.
And it is further reported that the
most liberal estimate Taggart could
make brought the total up to on!y 23L
leaving still eight votes necessary to
elect Judge Parker President of the
United States.
Taggart's meager disclosures, it is
understood, rudely surprised Judge
Parker, who had been much encour
aged by roseate predictions cf less
capacious visitors than Taggart.
It Is said that the latter's estimate
ran as follows: The solid South, 151;
New York. 3S; West Virginia, 7; NV
vada, 2. and Maryland, 8; total, 20S.
Relying upon doubtful States, this
total was increared by the addition of

KNEE BREECHES
WILL BE WORN
NF.W YORK, Aug. IS.â Leading rail
roads of the country have decided to
use even' means, both collectively and
-trrdtvfdually. to put railroad ticket
scaipers out .->r business- tr> ?T*ry city
of any considerable size from New
York to San Francisco.
They have acknowledged George H.
Daniels of the New York Central aa
their leader in this crusade, and he is
beginning the conduct of a bureau with
this purpose in view. Thus far prose
cutions in the courts have been con
ducted mainly In St. Louis, where the
scalpers have been doing a "land office"
business in World's Fair excursion
tickets, and several scalpers have been
sent to jail there for defying the in
junctions of the United States Circuit
Judges in Missouri, who forbade the
sale of railroad tickets by unauthorized
persons.
The raids made in St. Louis were at
the instance of many purchasers Â¦who
were compelled to pay fare by con
ductors. In these raids by the police
hundreds of non-transferable tickets
were seized and confiscated.
The railroad men say the scalping
business has grown to be so disrepu
table that it should be a comparative
ly easy matter to put the scalpers out
of business by a campaign of publicity
and this is what Daniels is doinjf at
present, while other railroad passen
ger agents, assisted by detectives, are
gathering evidence to be used against
scalpers doing business in New Tork,
Chicago, San Francisco and inter

is reported, sacrificed 20,000 more men, but gained important advantages in the matter of position. The main force of the attack was directed against the left
wing and resulted in the capture of Pigeon Bay positions and some of the forts at Liaoshan. At Palunchang the Japanese hastily mounted guns, which did
excellent service in aiding the storming of the right wiDg, where the Japanese' are said to have captured two forts of minor value, mounting eight four-inch,

BRYAHITES' KNIVES OUT FOR PARKER
WASHINGTON, Aug. IS.â The fact
that Shanghai Is what is popularly
known as an international port in all
probabilities will prevent the Japanese
conducting any offensive naval oper
ations against the Russian ships now
there. In ports of this character a
number of, nations have certain well
defined rights, granted to them by the
Government of the country in which
the port is located. The natural ex
pectation, therefore. Is that every ef
fort will be made to preserve the neu
trality of Shanghai ,and prevent any
active steps by Japan toward captur
ing vessels now there.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 19.â The
general impression in diplomatic
circles here is that Japan will yet
change her mind and surrender "the
Kyeshitelnl to the care of some neutral
power, reserving all rights. Such a
course, it Is pointed out, would
strengthen Japan's position and at the
same time avoid the possibility of com
plications affecting China's neutrality
and the limitation of the area of hos
tilities, which was prompted by Secre
tary Hay's note.
The question of the disarmament of
the Russian ships at Shanghai is, it is
understood, being settled on the spot
by the Toatai and the Consul General
of Russia. This matter is not expected
here to lead^ to the extreme measures
threatened at Tokio, in view of the
statement that Russia was reconciled
to the disarmament of the cruiser
Askold and the destroyer Grozovoi.
SHANGHAI, Aug. 18.â Upon the
recommendation of the chief of the
customs the Taotai of Shanghai will
allow the Russian cruiser Askold and
the Russian torpedo-boat destroyer
Grozovoi to remain in port until August
23, when one day's notice to leave or
disarm will be given them. The arrival
here fcf Chinese men of war is expected.
Odagiri, /the Japanese Consul Gen
eral, has notified the Taotai that a Jap
anese fleet is coming in' to Beize the
Askold and the Grozovoi. The chief
engineer of the Customs Department
reports that the Russian vessels are not
seaworthy.
The repairs being made by the Rus
sians on the Grozovoi will be completed
in about ten days. It is uncertain when
the repairs to the Askold will be fin
ished.
There is no uneasiness here, although
the situation is thought to be acute.
The foreign Consuls are determined to
preserve the neutrality of the port.
LONDON, Aug. 18. â Beyond repre
senting to China the importance of pre
serving the neutrality of her territoryt
Great Britain has taken no action in
regard to the Russian cruiser Askold
and the torpedo-boat destroyer Grozo
voi, now at Shanghai. The question
of the disposition of these ships is
looked upon as peculiarly a matter
which concerns Japan, Russia and
China. Sympathy is felt for the efforts
of Japan to prevent the two vessels
again participating in the war. If Rus
sia maintain her purpose to dismantle
them it is expected that Japanese
naval officers will be permitted to ex
amine the vessels and assure them
selves that they are really disarmed
and dismantled, as was done at Tslng
chou in the case of the Russian battle
ship Cesarevitch and the three torpedo
boat destroyers there.
TOKIO, Aug. 18.â It is not probable
that Japanese vessels will enter Shang
hai to seize the Rwssian warships there.
Japan always has taken the ground
that Shanghai Is an International port,
and during her war with China she re
frained from attacking it. Japan relies
upon the Chinese Government to dis
arm the cruiser Askold and the de
stroyer Grozovoi, but there Is no doubt
she will blockade the mouth-- of the
Yangtse River to prevent the escape of
the Russian vessels.

"CHICAGO. Aug. IS.â The fiercest riot
of the stockyards strike occurred to
night, when hungry dwellers of the
packing-house district sought to cap
ture and kill eight steers that had es
caped from the yards. The mob num
bered <000 rer^ns and the streets were
cleared only after 120 policemen, in five
Fquadror.p, fcad charged the rioters on
U'jr sides.
" Fhots were fir^d and scores of rioters
were 'dubbed. Few arrests were made,
rs the. police contented themselves with
diippereing the mob. In no previous
riots were clubs used so freely.
The speaker said there never was a
time when the plain people of America
were so dissatisfied with the condi
tions which prevailed in this republic.
Said he:
Deep down In their hearts the people feel
that the reins of power are Flipping out of
their hands. In eplte of all that can be done
by partlFan press, the fact cannot be concealed
from the *yeÂ» of the average citizen that the
vast preponderance of all the "wealth ""produced
In this labd Is transferred by legalized rob
bery to the hands of a few; that the courts
are run in the Interests of the few: that the
Jaw making power is manipulated by the
few; and that while both the old political
parties pretend to devote themselves to the
Interests of the common people, they are both
financed by Wall street, both dominated by
"Wall street, both the willing and servile tools
cf Wall street
It's an easier and quicker Job to strike an
open enemy right between the eyes than it is
to tear oft the mask from the face of a. pre
tended friend and shov him to be the hypo
crite that he Is.
Answering a self-asked question as
to why he consumed more time dis
cussing the Democrats than In speak
ing of the Republicans, the Populist
leader made reply:
I have no word of abuse for Theodore Roose
velt. I helie\-e him to be a brave, honest,
ccnsdeutiouB man. I give him full credit for
having a Eplendld courage of conviction; but
Inasmuch as he etanda for those government
principles which. In my Judgment, are hur
rying this republic Into a sordid despotism of
wealth. I will combat him and his principles
as long as there is breath in my body.
At another point the speaker said he
would not venture to say a word
against Judge Parker's character, "for
I believe him to be an eminently
worthy man."
Of President Roosevelt, Watson said:
Watson gave up a great portion of
his address to a discussion of the Dem
ocratic and Republican platforms and
the candidacy of Judge Parker. He
referred to the Democratic candidate's
gold telegram as follows:
Surrounded by the Wall street magnates
who had financed his campaign for two years,
JudRe Parker bided his time until the perils
of the two-thirds rule were passed, and, when
It was too late for the convention to retrace
Its steps â for even the Democratic bosses re
quire more than fifteen minutes to turn com
pletely around inâ he cracks the "Wall street
whip over the heads of his leaders and with
prompt obedience the great Democratic le-
Eions were made to furl their flag and reverse
their line of march.
In addressing Watson, Williams said
the convention that nominated him was
made up of unselfish, self-sacrificing
patriots, who attended ?nd participated
in its deliberations solely through a
high sense of duty.
"The purpose of the convention," he
continued, "was to take one more step
in the evolution of progress, which is
to finally bring us to that ideal condi
tion of society when the laborer shall
receive the full fruits of his labor, and
an injury to one 'shall be the concern
of all."
NEW YORK, Aug. 18.â Thomas E. x
Watson of Georgia, the Populist candi
date for President, and Thomas H. Tib
bies of Nebraska, Vice Presidential
candidate, were formally notified of
their nominations here to-night at
Cooper Union. Judge Samuel Williams
of Indiana made the speech officially
notifying the candidates of their selec
tion.
The Emperor has received from Cap
tain Reitzenstein, commander of the
Â«cruiser division at Port Arthur, a re
port of the battle of August 10. After
reviewing the progress of the battle up
to the time the Cesarevitch was dis
abled, it says that it was then decided
to try to break through the surround
ing Japanese Bhips at their weakest
point. The cruiser Askold led, followed
REITZENSTEIX REPORTS.
"Taking advantage of the calm, we
stopped our engines and quickly com
menced to repair the breaches in oui
vessels, so as to unable us to proceed
to Vladivostok.
"Captain lierlinsky of the Rossia
was killed and several of his offlcers
were wounded. On board the Gromoboi
two lieutenants were killed and other
officers were wounded. Both cruisers
had 125 men killed and 307 wounded.
Captain Berlinsky was buried at sea."
The report concludes by testifying
to the heroism displayed by all the offi
cers and men, who, it says, seemed to
have been made of iron, knowing nelth-.
er fear nor fatigue.
A personal examination of the. dam
age done to the cruisers by the Japan
ese fire, Admiral Alexieff says, in
transmitting the report, convinces him
of the high courage and self -sacrificing
efforts of those who took part in an.un
equal battle against the superior forces
of the Japanese. "\. â¢
"The Rossia had sustained el%ven
holes at her line and the Qromoboi had
Fix. Both cruisers lost more than half
their officers and the losses among the
men totaled 25 per cent.
"It appeared impossible to renew the
battle or to return to the Rurik, which
was now thirty miles to the south. %*
IX5SSES ARE GREAT.
"Shortly before 10 o'clock the enemy's
ftre was the most terrific of the battle,
but to our astonishment the whole
Japanese squadron left us after the
most deadly fighting, which had lasted
five hours.
"At 9:3) o'clock the Rurik began to
lag behind considerably, and again
turned her bows toward the shore, at
the same time fighting against the two
second-class cruisers which had Joined
the enemy's squadron. The Rurik soon
afterward began to get out of sight.
"yice Admiral Kamamura, with four
armored cruisers, kept steadfastly en
gaging us in such a manner as to keep
us from assisting the Rurik.
"While the Rurik continued fighting
we continued our efforts to attract the
enemy farther north. In the hope that
the Rurik would manage to dispose of
her two comparatively weaker oppo
nents and that after repairing the
damage to her rudder she would be
able to reach Vladivostok independ
ently. .
"We suffered considerable damage.
The Rossia had three funnels pierced,
which prevented her keeping up good
steam, and three of her boilers were
rendered useless.
JAPAXESE SUDDENLY RETIRE.
"Seeing that all of the Japanese
cruisers were concentrating their fire
on the Rurik, all my subsequent ma
neuvering was exclusively with the ob
ject of enabling the Rurik to repair her
damaged rudder. I attracted to myself
the enemy's fire in order to cover the
Rurik. (Admiral Jessen was on board
the flagship Rossia.)
"At this time I saw two warships,
one a second and the other a third
class cruiser, coming to Join the enemy.
"The Rurik hoisted the signal 'Can
not steer.' Some maneuvering in the
front line gave the Rurik a chance of
going in the direction of the Korean
Gulf and at 8 o'clock the signal was
hoisted 'Go east.' The Rurik answered
the signal and took the requisite course
at full speed, as could be seen from the
waves from her bows.
"Eventually the Rossia and the
Gromoboi took a northerly course at a
distance of forty-two cables. The Ru
rik kept a course approximately south
east at a distance of three miles.
"The battle continued for two hours
in this manner.
TRIES TO SAVE TIIE KURIK.
"I was, therefore, obliged to engage
in battle, which commenced at 5
o'clock in the morning, with a distance
of.Bixty cables between the two squad
rons (a cable length is 200 yards.)
"In the straits to the south we saw
a second-class cruiser of the Nanlwa
type coming to join the enemy.
"At a convenient opportunity we
rapidly turned to the right, intending
to approach the Korean coast, and by
Increasing our speed to seventeen knots
we seemed to have an opportunity of
succeeding, but the enemy now ob
served our intention and directed bis
course toward us for the purpose of
hindering our design.
"Hardly five minutes passed before
the Rurik left the ranks and signaled
that her steering gear was disabled.
I replied: 'Steer with the engines,' and
continued on mv former course.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 18.âEm
peror Nicholas has received a despatch
from Viceroy Alexieff, dated at Vladi
vostok, August 17, saying that the
cruisers Rossia and Gromoboi of the
Vladivostok squadron returned - to
Vladivostok August 16, and communi
cating the following report made by
Rear Admiral Jessen, commander of
the squadron: . ,
"At dawn on August 14 the Rossia,
Gromoboi and Rurik arrived forty-two
miles from and parallel with Fusan,
and thirty miles from the northern
lighthouse of Tsu Island, when to the
westward I saw -a Japanese squadron
of armored cruisers six miles to the
north traveling parallel with our
course. This squadron consisted of
four vessels of the late type and was
putting on full speed.
"I took a course to the northward,
with a view Jo attaining the open sea.
but the enemv, who was of superior
speed, turned immediately and took the
same course.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
CHICAGO. Aug. IS.â A slaughter of
the innocents took place in the wheat
pit at the opening to-day when several
million bushels went overboard in a
few seconds. In a speculative way the
bottom fell out of the market for five
minutes and small fortunes were lost
while the brokers desperately tried to.
execute selling orders. In tfÂ»n seconds
the prices made the following savaga
break from the closing prices of yester
day:
September from $1 06% to $1 06i'i, De
cember from $1 09 to %1 06%, May from
$1 ll}i to $1 OSVi.
Then the thing was reversed. The
whole list of futures was caught by a
fresh buying wave and swept higher
with a speed that made the bull mar
kets of previous days seem like slow
affairs. Here is the record of thi rally
that lasted less than ten minutes:
Septengber, $V 06U to $1 09; December,
$1 06% to $1 0934: May. Jl OSH to 11 12.
The air was full of reasons for thÂ»
phenomenal double action in prices
as soon as it was over. There was
frost in Manitoba or North Dakota as
predicted. Minneapolis was 2 cent3
lower on the curb two minutes before
the opening and the tradera jumped
to the conclusion that there was better
crop news. With the whole trada
keyed to a high pitch on the buying
side and thousands of people loaded
with lines on the 5 cents advance of
yesterday was all that was needed for
a few frightened holders to precipi
tate the panic. Thousands of orders to
sell were never filled until the market
righted itself and went up further,
then it went down.
Hundreds of nervous wheat owners
had hardly got rid of their grain when
it was reported In a telegram from

LOS ANGELES, Aug. IS.â Based on

at between 800 and 850 twelve-ton car
loads. This is a great advance over
the crop of last year, which amounted

NEW YORK, Aug. 18. â Two hun
dred negroes attacked Policeman
Frank Lawless this afternoon, dragged
him from the porch of his house, tore
his uniform from his body, trampled
upon hhn and doubtless would have
killed him but for the arrival of citi
zen help. While the Fire Department,
summoned by mistake Instead of the
reserves from the Adams-street sta
tion, was fighting fiercely for an en
trance to the street through the mob,
Policeman James Tynan and Â£us Ber
ner stood over the body of the uncon
scious Lawless, and, with revolvers
held the infuriated negroes at bay.
When the reserves finally arrived
and joined the firemen they were op
posed by fully 3000 negroes. In their
efforts to disperse the crowd men and
women were mowed down under a ter
rific onslaught, fire axes, short ladders,
revolvers and clubs being used. The
mob fought back with great despera
tion and the battle continued for an
hour before the streets were cleared.

San Diego County seems to hold the
balance' of power in the south on the
question of the United States Senator
ship. In Riverside, Orange, Ventura,
Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, Bard
Is credited with ten votes. In Los An
geles Frank R. Flint is credited with
11. Fresno and Kern counties are
counted for Bard, but neither county is
classed as belonging to Southern Cali
fornia. Eliminating Tulare, San Luis
Obispo, Fresno and Kern from the
calculations the list stands Bard 10.
Flint 11. Should the three votes of
San Diego be given to Bard, the junior
Senator would have 13 against Flint's
1L On the other hand should Flint
win the San Diego delegation he would
have 14 against 10 for Bard.
Senator Bard has developed strength
outside of his home county and the
politicians assert that Flint must de
velop support outside of Los Angeles
County in order to make his candidacy
formidable.
The situation in San Diego County is
thus presented by the Union:
"As has already been stated, the
Union believes that At will be a mis
take for the convention to instruct for
any Senatorial candidate. San Diego
County Republicans owe their first
duty to their own interest, which is
that Hon. M. L. Ward shall re
ceive the nomination for Congress
from the Eighth District.
SAN DIEGO DIVIDED.
"As matters are, the Republican
party of San Diego County is divided,
although without any bitterness, on
the Senatorial question. Senator Bard
and Mr. Oxnard and Mr. Flint have
each their supporters. Mr. "Ward, on
the other hand, has the united party
behind him. In these conditions It
would certainly Beem that consistency,
to say nothing of good politics, de
mands that the candidate whom the
entire party Is supporting should be
given the preference over aspirants for
another office among whom the party's
strength is divided. Surely it is hardly
just to the party itself to take a course
that might damage the chances of the
candidate on whom the party is united
in order to advance the interest of a
Senatorial aspirant who has only a
portion of the party behind him.
"San Diego is certainly not Indifferent
on the Senatorship question. Neverthe
less It Is only natural and proper that
the matter of first importance â the one
that comes directly home to the people
â is the success of the San Diego Coun
ty candidate for the Congressional
nomination. The men who are most
active in promoting Mr. Ward's candi
dacy, and who are In position to judge
pretty accurately as to the effect of any
action that the convention may take,
believe that Instructions as to the*
Senatorship cannot possibly Increase
Mr. Ward's chances, and may damage
them. It would seem that this view
should control. â¢ And it is probably un
necessary to suggest that the objection
thus made to instructions is not to be
taken as indicating the least unfriend
liness to any one of the three candi
dates. The whole affair is purely a
matter of expediency from the stand
point of an overshadowing local inter
est."
It is* gossip in political circles that
the contest between Bard and Flint
may assume the nature of a deadlock,
and that Oxnard will ultimately step
in and win the prize.-
VOTING 3IACHIXES.
The forty voting machines purchased
by San Francisco will be put In use
at the next general election, Tuesday,
November 8.
It Is probable that thirty-eight of the
machines, a number sufficient to sup
ply all the precincts of three average
Assembly districts, will be installed for
practical operation and then held in
reserve to be used in the event of
breakage.

though the assessments are practically
the same as last year the City Trustees
have seen their way clear to reduce the
tax rate for the fiscal year from 51 87
to $1 80, owing to the fact that the city
has grown considerably during the
year.
On Saturday the regulation pro

out as originally prescribed. The divi

tioned here will take place Sunday at 3
o'clock on the grounds adjacent to the
Asuncion depot.
To-morrow afternoon there will be a
division drill of the Hospital Corps, un

will be a very interesting drill and will
be attended by nearly all of the militia
in camp.

The third exercise was of a similar
character and equally as interesting as
the others. In these maneuvers Major

MONTGOMERY AVENUE BONDS
In the first exercise Colonel Finley,
Seventh Infantry. N. G. C, was in
command of the blues and Lieutenant ;
Colonel Juilliard, Fifth Infantry, was
in command of the brown forces. The
invading force, the bluea, were en
camped near Needle Flat, while the
brown force garrisoned Paso Robles. i
Colonel Juilliard of the browns, learn- |
ing of the approach of the blues, sent
out an advance guard to ascertain the
strength of the blues with the possi
bility of attacking them if in his dis
cretion it was advisable. The browns
and blues met in several short en
counters and met with casualties on
both sides. When recall came, how
ever, there had been no close attack by
Colonel Juilliard's forces.
Exercise No. 2 proved to be of a very
lively nature. The brown forces under
command of Colonel J. F. Hayes, Fifth
Infantry, N. G. C, were encamped on
Atascadero Creek, while endeavoring to
get to Atascadero station. They learned
that a force of blues under command
of Lieutenant Colonel Stewart, Sixth
Infantry, N. G. C, had the station
strongly guarded. Colonel Hayes, ac
cordingly sent out his outposts.
GALLANT FIRST TO THE FORE.
Major C. E. Haven, with the Third
Battalion of the Fifth, was upon the
extreme right flank, and Captain Hunt,
with the First Battalion of the Fifth,
was on the extreme left flank. Cap
tain W. L. Wall in the meantime, with
Companies E and G of the First In
fantry and two platoons of the field ar
tillery, under command of Lieutenant
Augustine Mclntyre, had climbed up a
steep ascent to a commanding point
called Target Hill. Here Lieutenant
W. P. Humphreys, Company E. First
California, showed extraordinary and
praiseworthy energy in putting up a
lonsr line of breastworks.
Captain Wall stood on the top
of the mountain and, scanning the
country with a powerful field glass,
finally located the blue forces ap
proaching at a distance of 3000 yards.
The guns of the field artillery were Im
mediately turned on them, and thun
dered forth In great style for fully fif
teen minutes. Suddenly the blues were
seen to retreat, and at that very mo
ment the artillery of the blue forces was
seen to reach the top of a distant hill,
ATASCADERO, Aug. 18.â Again the
booming of cannon, the sharp crack
of the Krag-Jorgensen rifles, the
clanging of the accouterments of the
cavalry and the rumblings of the
batteries of field artillery are resound
ing. Regulars and militia have once
again been merged side by side in the
battle maneuvers, with the result of a
splendid day's work.
The chief umpires have expressed
themselves as much pleased with the
work accomplished. The militia have
become accustomed to their surround
ings and follow readily into the routine
work as mapped out- by army regula
tions. Together with the regulars they
went into the different evolutions with
vim and spirit.
An esprit de corps -has been estab
lished between the Federal and State
troops and harmony reigns supreme in
all the different associations. Problem
No. 3, which was worked out to-day,
was arranged in three exercises. They
were all worked out on the lines of at
tack and defense of outposts. In the
first and second exercises the militia
played the leading roles, the different
forces being entirely in charge of offi
cers of the N. G. C.

counties had been cited to appear, in

Â°jt unnecessary for these counties to de

will "be changed.
The board found the total valuation
of real estate and improvements, per

credits, based on the rolls of all the
county- auditors, to be $1,480,070,243. The

"That on the 15th day of July. 1904,
the defendant was a male inhabitant of
Sausalito and within the required age
to render him liable to the tax. It then
proceeds to charge In the language of
the ordinance that he has willfully and
unlawfully failed, neglected and â¢ re
fused to pay the tax, on or before the
SOth day of July, 1904.
"The complaint may not be a model of
pleading or a precedent to follow, but
in view of the provisions of section 960
of the Penal Code, the court deems it
sufficient to apprise the defendant of
the nature of the charge against him
and deprives him of no substantial
right.
"It Is therefore ordered that the de
murrer be overuled and the defendant
will plead to the complaint."
"The demurrer presents for consider
ation two cardinal points, to whic-h all
others are subsidiary: First â Does the
complaint upon w hich this proceeding
is based state facts suttlcient within
the provisions of Ordinance 135, to ap
prise the defendant of the nature of
the charge against him? Second â Is
the ordinance itself constitutional?
"The court will give its views upon
these questions in the inverse order of
their statement.
"Does the ordinance levying a street
poll tax and prescribing a penalty o"
tine and imprisonment for refusal to
pay conflict with the constitution, or
violate any general Jaw of the State?
It is asserted, with much earnestness,
that because the constitution, article
XIII, section 11\ provides that "The
Legislature shall provide for the levy
and collecction of an annual p tax,'
to be 'paid into the State sclu- ;nd,'
that no other, further or dm..., poll
tax shall be levied by authority Â«>i law.
If the maxim exDressio unius est ex
clusio alterius were to be alone re
sorted to, and if this court were sitting
as a tribunal of last resort in a case of
first impression, the argument might
recommend itself to weightier consider
ation than the court is inclined to give
it. In the first place, the legislative
construction given the above article of
the constitution is entitled to much
weight in deciding the matter, so far
as this court is concerned.
"In the case of Sam Wah on habeas
corpus, the Supreme Court, by Justice
de Haven, considered at some length
the question whether a statute making
it an offense to obstruct an officer in
the collection of 'any revenue taxes en
sums af money In which the people of
the State are interested,' could be ap
plied to the resistance of a person to a
municipal officer of a town of the sixth
class in endeavoring to collÂ«ct *a
street poll tax.' The learned Justice Jn
deciding the matter never gave an ut
terance to the effect that the 'street
poll tax' was unconstitutional. It is
true the point was not presented for
consideration, but if its unconstitution
ality was so plain and palpable it
would never have escaped the seven
Judges who interested themselves in
the law of that case.
"It is sufficient for this court that the
act of the Legislature creating the
court has granted to the trustees of
municipal corporations of the sixth
class, in language so plain that it is
not susceptible of misconstruction,
power to 'impose on and collect from
every male inhabitant, between the
ages of 21 and 60 years, an annual
street poll tax not exceeding J2.'
"The court will now consider the suf
ficiency of the complaint.
"The complaint alleges In substance:
"The act of the Legislature creating
the Recorder's Court in cities of tha
sixth class has conferred upon it con
current jurisdiction the Jusik-es'
Courts and provides that the mode of
procedure in the Iiecorder s Court shall
be the same as are or may be pre
scribed by law for Justices' Courts in
like cases.
SAL'SALITO, Aug. 13.â Justice Pryor
to-day overruled the demurrer of Fred
erick Marriott questioning the consti
tutionality of the stieet poll tax. Mar
riott has two days in which to plead
Judge Pryor in his opinion says in
part:
"This is a criminal action brought
by the people of the State of Cali
fornia against Frederick Marriott,
charging him with having violated
ordinance No. 135 of the Board of Trus
tees of the town of tiausalito, to wit:
Having failed, neglected and refused
to pay his annual street poll tax. The
defendant appeared in court at the
time set for arraignment and hied a
written demurrer.

DENIES THE TilEFT.
Hodprkiris* connection with- the case
dates from the time it was reported to
him by Mrs. Mein. There was a con
troversy between the two because the
Chief refused to arrest Miss McNaugh
ton unless Mrs. Mein should swear to
a complaint against her former em
ploye. This Mrs. Mein had refused to
do. She accused Hodgkins of shielding
the girl, and declared Miss McNaugh
ton had said she held Hodgkins under
her thumb. The girl has denied mak
ing this statement.
During a lapse after the warfare of
words between Mrs. Mein and Hodg
kins, the girl disappeared from Oak
land. She bobbed up at Larkspur, in
charge of George Clary, an alleged
private detective. Then came a chap
ter in effect that Hodgkins had the
girl sent to Larkspur and had paid for
her board. Hodgkins flatly denies this
as does Miss McNaughton. . . ,
Meanwhile Mrs. Mein consulted an
attorney and after consideration de
cided to swear to a complaint herself.
This was done and as the result the
young woman is in the County Jail.
She was located in Los Angeles by
Hodgkins, who used information said
to have been supplied by A. J. Court,
manager of a private detective agency
in San Francisco.
Court has claimed a reward of $25
offered for Miss McNaughton's arrest.

McNaughton's arrest.
As soon as the prisoner was installed
in the jail under care of Matron White,
Dr. C. L. Tisdale, the jail physician,
examined the girl and issued an order
that she be kept in strict seclusion.
Denials all along the line were sent
out in volleys to-day as affecting the
McNaughton side of the accusations
that havr ; been piled up against the
woman since Mrs. Mein reported* the
loss of her Jewelry and finery to Chief
of Police Hodgkins.
Miss McNaughton insists to her sis
ter and to Constable Hempstead that
she is guiltless; that she is the victim
of spite on the part of Clara La Perl,
known as Haggart, who had been em
ployed with her as a housemaid at the
Mein residence. Also does Miss Mc-
Naughton deny that Chief of Police
Hodgkins had shielded her in any way
or that she had any acquaintance with
Hodgkins except suclj as she had
formed through twice meeting him at
his oKice on police business.

her come to my office after Mrs. Mein

She and the other girl, Clara La Per 1 ,

ALAMEDA, Aug. 18.â The fortunate
overturning of a water pitcher was
all that saved Mrs. Cllne Force from
being choked to death by an unknown
intruder In the Force home at 2142
Alameda avenue last evening. As it
was. Mrs. Force was choked' into in
sensibility and Is suffering greatly from
the shock to her nerves.
Dr. Force and Frederick Bangasser
were sitting In. the kitchen reading,
while Mrs. Force was preparing sup
per. At 8:30 o'clock Mrs. Force thought
she heard a slight noise in the front
room, which Is separated from the
kitchen by a small bathroom. Mr3.
Force was not entirely sure that she
heard a noise and so said nothing to
her husband, thinking possibly tljat
her nerves had played her a trick.
When she entered the bathroom she
closed the door separating It from thÂ«
room where her husband and his com
panion were sitting.
As she approached the front bedroom
she saw the figure of a man approach
ing and turned to flee. She was not
quick enough, however, and was rudely
grasped by the intruder, - who -threw
her to the floor, where he proceeded
to beat and choke h'er. Mrs. Fore*
could not cry out, but in her struggles
with the man she overturned a small
table on which sat, a pitcher of water
and the crash of the broken crockery
brought her husband to the scene. As
Dr. Force approached the assailant left
his victim and brushing aside .the doc
tor, rushed through the house and
made his escape. > *
"We had been to the city and were
late getting home," said" Mrs. Force
this afternoon. ."I .was preparing sup
per when I thought I heard a noise
in the front room. As my husband had
several ' times ' joked ' me : about my
nerves I did not tell him of my fears,
but went to Investigate for myself. I
had just closed the door when I noticed
a man standing near the bureau. I
was too startled to scream and before
I could flee from the room he had me
by the throat and bore me to the floor.
In my fall I overturned a table and
broke a water pitcher. I then lost
consciousness. The rest you know."
The motive of the crime wÂ«ts rob
bery, several drawers having been ran
sacked, but no valuables were missing.
The robber escaped.
Lady Yarde-Buller has been much

travagant and eccentric actions.
In the past two years George T.
"Wright of Alameda has been her guar
dian and cared for her Interests while
f-he has been confined in a Livermore
f-anitarium. Indulgence In intoxicants,
it was charted, had stolen away her
faculties. Two years of moderation,
however, it is claimed, has resulted in
preat benefit to her health,
Lady Yarde-Buller was formerly
Mary'Leilah Kirkham, a daughter of
General R. W. Kirkham. from whom
she inherited a large fortune. She was
divorced from Blair and married Hon.
"Vsrde-Buller. a second son of an Eng

wealthy, but high living and dissipa
tion have eaten into her fortune. Lord
Churston of England is her brother-in

of her English interests, which, how
fv*r, are now -stated to consist mostly
of debts.

Hemmed In by flames, Herman F.
Sack, a grocer at Piedmont avenue and
Forty-first, street, was compelled to
fight his way out of the living rooms
in the rear of h!s store to save his
wife and three children from being
burned to death. In the fire Sack's
grocery was destroyed, W. J. Lund's
butcher shop adjoining was burned and
four horses, three of which Sack own
ed, perished. One of the animals was
"Ginger," a valuable polo pony owned
by Oscar F. Lunio?. Mr. and Mrs. J.
B. Morse's cottaÂ£Â«* near by was dam
aged.
After Sack got his family out of dan
ger he tried to save the horses that
were stabled in his barn, but nothing
could be done for them. Two "horses
were dragged out, but they were both
badly burned. The grocer was scorched
severely about the hands and face.
The fire broke out at 2:30 o'clock in a
pile of rubbish. Some one had seen it
smoldering -at midnight and played a
stream from a garden hose on thu de
bris, but later the flames took a fresh
start, the barn near the store being
afire before it was noticed. Morse
aroused Sack's family after the store
buildings had caught. There was half
an hour's delay sounding an alarm.
An excited person gave a telephone
call, but neglected to tejl where the fire
was located. D. Dwyer owned the
burned bujldings. The losses, totaling
$5000. were partially covered by insur
ance.

"Where you find an organization that
is working locality," continued the Sen
ator, "you will find a factor that Is not
only improving its own part of town,
but the entire community will be bene
fited. In helping ourselves we are help
ing all. I call your attention to the
large sign at the end of the hall, 'In
unity there is strength.' ."
Dr. C. L. Tisdale was invited to make
an address. He stated that as politics
and religion were barred he would feel
at a great loss to properly express him
self to the gathering.
Justice R. B. Tappan told of some
improvements he would like to have
made. He wanted, primarily,-to see a
breakwater built along the south shore,
stating that he had seen chunks of
Alameda three feet in thickness fall
into the bay. â¢ (
Editor Leydecker of the Frultvale
Progress and other representative citi
zens of adjacent communities also
made short addresses.
This was the first affair of the kind
given by the West End Association
and owing to the efforts of President
Smith and Secretary Mehrtens was a
pronounced success, y
Musical and vocal â¢ numbers were
rendered and stories told between the
speeches. "
Joseph R. Know{and assured the as

in the work of the advancement of
Alaraeda, it was largely responsible for
the present upbuilding of the town.
OAKLAND. Aug. 18.â About four
hundred members and guests were
present at the- smoker and. banquet
given by the West End Improvement
Club at the Wigwam this evening.
President C. It. Smith welcomed the
guests of the association with a few brief
remarks and introduced Mayor Olney
of Oakland. The Mayor spoke briefly
on' topics of general Interest to the two
cities and concluded by assuring the
people of Alameda that although Oak
land greatly desired annexation it did
not intend to force Alameda Into an
unwilling alliance.
"We put our arms around each other
and waited to die. "We wanted nothing
to eat. I was awfully hungry, but tha
boys drank a lot of swamp water, and
did not care for anything."
This was the melancholy statement
of Emma Hauser made to-night to tha
police.
Just before dark Tuesday night tha
children met in their little playhouse
in the back vard of their home and
soon after disappeared.

CHICAGO. Aug. IS. â Preferring
death by starvation and exposure to
being mercilessly tortured and beaten
by their stepmother, Emma, Emil and
Ernest Hauser. aged 11. 8 and 6 years,
respectively, whose father is Charles
Hauser an Oak Park carpenter, spent
two days and three nights In th
swamps along the Des Plaines River.
They were discovered by farmers ami
captured after a long chase by several
farmers and policemen and brought
back to Oak Park station to-day. The
consequences of the children's desper
ate deed are hard to estimate, so de
clare the doctors who were called in
to-night. Their little bodies presented
a pitiful sight as they lay emaciated
and shivering on the benches and cot3
at the police station.
The children declare they were driven
to desperation by the systematic
cruelty of the second Mrs. Hauser. wh'Â»
became their "new mother" but thre*
weeks ago. The woman, as soon as
she stepped Into the home, say the
children, subjected them t& cruel beat
ings.
Although sinking from hunger and
exhaustion, the children made a frantic
attempt to outrun the police because of
their fear of being taken back to their
home.

The telephones used by the municipal
government at the City Hall and the
Hall of Justice are likely to come under
the ownership - of the city. At the
meeting of the Board of Electricity
,held last night at the Hall of Justice,
Fire Commissioner -Boyne complained
of the rank service given by the tele
phone company, and suggested that the
Board of Electricity be instructed to
install a private exchange system of its
own in these buildings.
Some of the other commissioners also
had something to say detrimental to
the service, and the matter was re
ferred to Chairman Reagan, who will
confer with the Board of Electricity.
The members of the board complain
that it is almost impossible to get a
switch on the phones in the two build
ings, and believe that a system run by
the Board, of Electricity would give
satisfaction.
Firemen may hereafter move but
once a year if the proposed rule sug
gested by Chief Electrician Hewitt ia
passed. It will be a case of pay rent
or leave the fire department. Hewitt
complained that he was compelled to
change tappers several times a year in
the houses of the' various firemen who
have the moving mania. Each man is
allowed to have/ a tapper in his house
so that he maj- respond to fires, and
must live witnin a radius of three
blocks of the fire house. Hewitt says
that some of the firemen have moved
six or eight times during the year and
that it costs the city $20 every time a
tapper is changed. Fourteen thousand
and seven hundred feet of municipal
wire were used last year in the instal
lation of new gongs. Hewitt's propo
sition that firemen be allowed to move
but once a year was referred to Chair
man Reagan, and will no doubt become
a lav/ of the fire department.
S. H. Richards and Thomas "Walsh,
machinists in the employ of the Board
of Electricity, sent in a communication
asking. for a raise in wages from $90 to
$100, arid H. R. Brown, foreman df the
repair shop, asked for an increase from
$90 to $120. Each of these requests
were refused.
F. E. Haskell, foreman of the Inside

of the outside wiremen, were each
granted a "raise in salarv from $100 to

NEW YORK, Aus. 18.â Johnny
Reagan of Brooklyn and Frankle Neil
of San Francisco were matched here
to-day to fight twenty rounds at 116
pounds for the bantam-weight cham
pionship of the world.
'Buchanan, However, Never Weakens
and Siwashes Arc Baffled.
SEATTLE, Aug. 18. â For six in
nings Jay Hughes and Buchanan had
one of the greatest pitchers' battles
ever seen in Seattle. Not a player got
â¢uithin a mile of the plate and only
one hit had been made off Hughes and
three off Buchanan.
In the se%-enth Moskiman, Byrnes
and Buchanan landed on Hughes for
singles and Francks followed with a
triple. To give the inning a good set
ting Hughes gave a base on balls and
made a bad throw to third. Five runs,
â¢four of which were earned, went down
to Oakland's credit- This was enough
to win the game and Seattle went
down and out. Buchanan pitched one
of the most masterly games seen In
Seattle this season. Francks' work at
short, as well as that of Russ Hall,
was of the sensational order. Score:

CHINA MAID IS BEATEN*
IX METROPOLITAN EVENT
Champion Jeffries, after training ac
cording to the dictates of his own
sweet will, seems to have reached the
perfection of condition according to the
latest reports from his retreat in the
Lake County mountains.
Despite the amount of outdoor work
he has done he is still on the big side
and it seems assured he will enter the
ring weighing 240 pounds or more.
This will be all muscle so he will easily
be the world's greatest athlete when
he enters the ring at Mechanics' Pa
vilion or.e week from to-night. Per
sons who have seen his work recently
say he is a marvel of agility as well
as of strength.
Munroe stock seems in the ascend
ency in the East. Plunger Joe Yea
ger, who has made a fortune on the
race tracks in the last two years,
wired a betting commissioner here yes
terday asking at what price he can
get 55000 or $10,000 on Munroe. In what
little betting has been done Jeffries has
been a 4 to 10 choice. It is expected
these will remain the prevailing prices.
George Siler, the famous Eastern ex
pert on boxing, does not think much of
Munroe's chances. He has said so in
print. Harry Pollok replies to him
and incidentally takes another slap at
Eddie Graney. He says:
George Siler's latest takes a swing at Mun
roe's chances with Jeffries, and the miner
does no % t fall in line for any of the flowers.
Curtains for Mr. Slier. He knows as much
about Munroe's fighting ability as a deep sea
sailor knows about steering a twenty-four
knot Jag on dry land. Siler was never within
a thousand miles of Munroe when the miner
had a fight. He never raw him put up his
hands.x. I have the deepest respect for Mr.
Slier as a fistic expert, referee and man but
please let him peddle a little "dope" on some
thing he knows what he's writing about and
stop shooting at the sky.
Slier also comments upon the fact that
Graney is to referee the fight and wonders at
niy accepting him.
I would like to set that matter straight
once for all. Graney Is not my choice. I
would rather have Billy Delaney reft-ree than
Graney. He has been forced on me. Were
I the only one concerned he would not offl
cir.te â even If I had to call the ttght off. I
have Munroe to consider, however. I know
that Munroe can beat Jeffries and It would
be most unfair to him to deprive him of the
opportunity to win the world's championship.
Graney s unfairness robbed one of the beEt
little fellows that ever breathed of a hard
earned title. I refer to "Young Corbett." He
was my friend and his injury was mine
Tli*re are other reasons why I don't want
Grarey, but I'll let it go at that

JEFFRIES. AS THE CAMERA SHOWS HIM AT THE PRESENT TIME IN ALL
HIS MUSCULAR GLORT. THIS HUGE BAG IS HIS FAVORITE IMPLE
MENT OF TRAINING AND HE GETS MUCH EXERCISE OUT OF IT
For six periods the natives co-uld not
tap any of Keefe's benders safely. An
derson got the first, a scratchy affair
to short. Miller lined an easy one at
Casey, who fumbled and then threw
the ball away. Gochnauer partook of
a pass, making a full house. It looked
like an even dozen when Gorton
smacked to center and in came Andy.
But Whalen hit to Keefe and in a
twinkling a double play was pulled off
and then it was curtains with Uncle
Harris.
In the ninth they had another swell
thance, but again it was passed up.
Gorton again lined it out safely, Wald
lon was hit by the pitcher and Shee
han booted Hildebrand's hot one.
â¢Another full house and two in the cel
lar. Every one expected Deacon Van
Buren was about due to swing
through, but the best he had was an
easy one to Keefe and all was over
for. the day. The score:

Mike Fisher, the horseshoe kid, bit off
another chunk of percentage yesterday
at Recreation Park and, strangely
enough, by the same score as on the
previous day. Again he had the luck,
for both runs were made without the
aid of hits, one on an error and the
other on a wild pitch. San Francisco
had royal chances, but nothing doing.
Score. 2 to L
â¢ It must be admitted that young
Keefe pitched a great game as lar as
the hits count, but he was ever so
Mild and at critical periods, too. But
dame fortune never once threw him
down when he needed her assistance
most, so twice he got out of holes that
%vould have meant half a dc/zen runs
under ordinary circumstances.
Mr. Nordyke rounded the bags twice
for Mike, in the first inning by forcing
Sheehan. advancing on a base on balls
and a wild pitch. In round seven Mil
ler's miscue gave him a chance. Eagan
sacrificed, after which Dyke sneaked
to third when Gorton was not looking
and landed on Lynch's fly to deep cen
ter.
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 18.â The second
day of the Pacific Coast Trotting
Horse Breeders' Association races at
tracted a smaller attendance than on
the opening day, but the sport proved
more interesting. %*
Much interest was shown in the 2:16
class trot, as a local favorite, Gjuce
Brothers" Ole, was entered. In the first
heat the spectators cheered when Ole
beat Briney K. Time 2:ll}i.
In the, first heat of the two-year-old
pacing race, William Durfee, who was
driving Roberta, claimed that F. W.
Chadbourn, driver of Mona Wilkes, in- ;
terfered with and caused Roberta to
be distanced. The claim was sustained
by the judges and Roberta was allowed
to start in the next heat. She finished
second.
When the horses in the 2:16 trot came
out for the first heat "â judges called
the diivers to the stand and announced
that it was reported there was collu
sion among the drivers. They were
cautioned and were told severe punish
ment would be meted out to them if
anything like a job developed. The
warning had Its effect if any trickery
was intended.
In the fourth and last heat of the
two-year-old pace Delilah and Roberta
finished in what many of the specta
tors considered a dead heat. Delilah
was several yards behind Roberta
when they entered the stretch. With
vigorous urging Delilah managed to
get to the side of Roberta. As the
two horses went under the wire neck
and neck Roberta broke. The judges
decided in favor of Delilah, holding
that Durfee, the driver of Roberta, did
not make any attempt to get his ani
mal back to a pace at once. Summary:

SARATOGA, Aug. 18.â Africander
displayed a bit of his old form to-day
by beating Graziallo in the handicap at
one and three-sixteenths miles in 2:01,
fair time for a track, which was again
dead slow as compared with its best
condition. Rain fell for an hour or
two last night and the track did not
resume its normal condition. Go Be
tween, now owned by "Charley" Fox
and trained by Frank Brown, was a
good third, gaining at the end. Major
Daingerfield and Shorthose, the other
starters, were beaten off.
The only stake of the day was the
Albany Handicap, worth $2960. It was
won by John W. Schorr's game colt
Jack Lory, which was carrying three
pounds penalty for having run after
the weights were announced three days
ago. The actual top weight was Me-
Chord at 120 pounds. He ran a mis
erable race. He was on the inside and
for three furlongs was in front or near
the front. He fell out of his position
suddenly and thereafter his perform
ance amazed the onlookers. Lyne ap
peared to be punishing him, but the
colt stopped badly, finally finishing
many lengths away from Jack Lory,
which on their last meeting had run
him to a head. Chrysitis was second
and Dandelion third. Time, 1:14 2-5.

CHICAGO, Aug. 18.â Moorish Damsel
received the only heavy play in the
Midsummer stakes to-day, the feature
event at Hawthorne. She hardly ran
a hundred yards before she got Into e
jam and went down heavily. Helge
sen, who had his first mount here in
some time, was thrown without receiv
ing: serious Injury. Lady Ellison set a
fast pace all the way into the stretch
and appeared a winner at this point,
but Tom Shelly, which had been run
ning second, came fast at the end and
easily disposed of her. Lord Dixon
made up much ground and finished an
easy third.
James Arthur's Huzzah, which fin
ished second to Ananias in the third
race, was disqualified by the judges for
fouling Birch Broom at the first turn
and throwing: the fllly against the
fence. Ananias proved the best of the
quartet, leading all the way.
A large crowd was in attendance,
drawn by the good card and the pleas
ant weather. The track was a trifle
slow. Alma Dufour and Ram's Horn
were the only winning favorites. Sum

Old sailors wagged their heads and looked
serious yesterday as the liner Doric raced
toward the Golden Gate on her way to the
Orient. Among her passengers arc more than
twenty missionaries and, to a mariner, calling
on Friday Is a good luck charm compared
with carrying people of this calling. No mat
ter how religious Jack may be, and God fearing
sailors are not few. he balks at the cloth
when the wearer Is a shipmate. On the Done,
however, officers and men are uÂ«?ed to mis
sionaries and believe the gallant liner Immune
from any spell the carrying of clergymen may
invite.

British naval squadron in Pacific wa

the American cruisers New York and
Marblehead. now in Esquimau har
bor, aboard the British cruiser Graf
ton, flagship of the squadron, last
evening for a farewell entertainment.
The occasion was one of the happiest
ever seen in this station, the British
anJ American tars fraternizing in the
most enthusiastic manner. The bands
of the New York, and Grafton provided
Uw music and the warships were all
gayly decorated and brilliantly illum
inated. At parting all the ship's com
pany sang "Auld Lang Syne" and the
national anthems of Great Britain
and the United States. The American
cruisers leave in the morning for San

â¢" NEW YORK. Aug. 18.â For the pur
'. pose of establishing a test, power was
. tu-day turned on in the rapid transit
- : subway and electric trains were run
f-over the line from downtown stations
"^to Harlem. The long predicted trip
â¢froni the City Hall to Harlem in fif
. tt-en minutes was accomplished. Most
.ef the trains ran slowly past the sta
"* tions, but were speeded beyond One
I Hundred and Sixteenth street.
The climax of the test was made by
ss cicked crew with four cars run at
high speed over the entire route. Some
of the turns were made at a dizzy gait.
. precautions having been taken to have
the. track clear for the one great effort
* of the night. The experiment was a
complete success and Harlem was
reached Â¦well within the time allow
acre of fifteen minutes. To those on
the train the stations appeared and
smelted away as in a picture. So quiet
ly did the cars move at their highest
fpeed that only the watchmen heard
their passage.
The greatest secrecy was maintained
by the officials of the road. Men at
the stations were instructed to allow
Â«o one without a special permit to get
below the level of the street. One of
the objects of the experiment was to
Â¦familiarize the men at the controllers
" the twists and turns of the road.
There are many signals to learn and
ihe motormen were confronted with
Â¦problems conceived by the superin
tendent to fool them and teach them to
avoid collisions.
MARYSVILLE, Aug. 18. â The com
mission of engineers spent to-day
along the Feather River and it was
evident that this portion of the in
spection possesses for the visitors an
unusual degree of interest, since their
acquaintance with debris deposits of
such magnitude Is, according to their
own admissions, somewhat slender.
A committee of citizens welcomed
the party upon its arrival from Chlco
and accompanied the engineers upon
the long and tiresome journey to
Point Deguerre, where a cut-off Is
nearing completion. Members -of the
Marysville committee who were born
and raised on the Tuba's banks point
ed out their former homes and or
chards, now buried under sand that in
places attains a depth of sixty feet
Upon their return to Marysville to
night the engineers had a short con
ference with a number of prominent
business men and the history of hy
draulic mining was given close atten
tion. To-morrow morning the party
will visit Marcuse, where levee build
ing- is in progress.

Shortly after the servant had re
ceived this lesson in democracy Abdul
wanted something in a hurry. The
servant was slow and Abdul raised his
hand to smite. Just then the wind
blew out the ensign floating over the
liner's stern and the servant re
membered.
Whang! Abdul was sitting on the
deck, the victim of a democratic right
swing, While stars, not in the flag,
danced before the dusky chieftain's
eyes, the self freed slave kicked his
master in the face and was stamping
him into the deck when a bystander
interfered.
Abdul was for beheading the pre
sumptuous servant, but the liner's reg
ulations would not permit this. The
servant was discharged from Abdul's
service, but at Honolulu the British
Consul made the Hindoo- pay his for
mer slave's passage to his Indian home.
The Siberia hroucht the Chinese crew
for the new liner Manchuria. In order
to avoid conflict with the Chinese bu
reau, the Manchuria's sailors were
shipped as part of the Siberia's crew.
They will be transferred to-day to the
larger liner.
The Siberia brought twenty white
passengers in the steerage, 485 Asiatics
and cabin passengers as follows:
The Pacific Mall Steamship Com
pany's liner Siberia, Captain J. Tre
maine Smith in command, arrived
early yesterday morning from the
Orient loaded deeply with freight and
crowded with passengers of high and
low estate. On board were men of af
fairs from many lands; people whose
names are familiar in the social and
political world and coolies from the
rural districts of China and Japan. The
liner's cargo included Japanese gcrld
yen, valued at J950.000. part payment
for some of the cargoes carried from
here and classed by the Russian au
thorities as contraband. The Siberia
also bought 637 bales of raw silk, val
ued at more than $400,000, and her
cargo included 29,976 chests of tea, 8052
bags and mats of rice, 2420 rolls of
matting and 6450 bags of sugar.
Although the Siberia anchored off
Meiggs wharf before 9 o'clock it was
nearly 3 o'clock before she was along
side the Pacific Mail wharf. Part of
this delay was in quarantine. There
Is no telephonic communication be
tween the mainland and the quaran
tine station and much time was lust
yesterday while the slow traveling
General Sternberg plowed her way
gravely to Angel Island for reinforce
ments of doctors to examine the liner's
passengers. This isolation o-f the quar
antine station is attributed to the ne
glect of Congressman Livernash. The
old cable gave out some months ago.
Senator Perkins attended to the pass
ing through the Senate of an appro
priation for a new cable and Livernash
was to have looked out for it in . the
lower house, but failed to do so and
the shipping interests of this port are
now suffering the consequence.
Among the liner's passengers was
William Martin, United States Consul
at Nanking, the political center o-f
Southern China. Martin is home on
leave and is accompanied by his two
daughters, who keep house for him
and dispense the hospitalities of the
consulate. During Martin's absence
Consul General Cheshire is looking out
for American interests at Nanking.
Cheshire was appointed to Mukden,
but will not be wanted there until
Japan and Russia settle their difficul
ties.
George Peel and F. E. Hesse, who
were passengers on the liner, have
been on a tour of inspection of the
cable stations owned by the Eastern
Extension Cable Company, the British
cable trust. Peel, who is a director of
the company, is a grandson of the
famous Sir Robert Peel. His father
holds a distinguished place In British
political life. Hesse is the general
manager of the company. Their tour
has taken them around the world, al
though they spent most time in Aus
tralia.
* Abdul Gufeer Khan, the Colorado
maduro chief of the Dharampor dis
trict in Northern India, was also on
the liner. Abdul, at home, is a large
land owner and a man of great wealth.
His brother is Prime Minister to the
Rajah of Delhi. Abdul, who Is going
to London, carries with him an Inter
preter and one native servant. He
started on the Siberia .with two ser
vants. When Abdul says "go" to a
servant, he expects prompt action. Any
lack of promptness is punished with a
rain of blows delivered with the most
convenient weapon. Somebody told the
servant, who is not now in his train,
that the Siberia's deck was part of the
land of freedom and that under the
American flag one man was as good
as another.

This is professional confirmation of our statement,
made in a review of the expectations roused by some
theorists. Colonel Lippincott adds, that: "In some dis
tricts in Southern California where the water is all dis
tributed in pipe lines, or cement ditches, they occasion
ally make a miner's inch serve as much as ten acres,
but usually where the water supply is not so limited a
duty of a miner's inch to two, three or possibly five acres
is customary. In most instances where we are planning
irrigation works we are making an absolute determina
tion, by a season's measurement, of the amount of
water actually- used in growing crops in that particular
locality.
"For instance, under the Yuma project we find there is
used a pumping system, where each man pays for what
WE are in receipt of a letter from Colonel Lippin
cott, a supervising engineer' of the Federal irri
gation work, in regard to the service of water,
in which he says that "There is not a place in California
or anywhere else on earth where a miner's inch of water
is made to irrigate 500 acres of land, or anywhere near
THE SERVICE OF WATER.

Roosevelt and Bismarck.
A journal In the City of Mexico,
after quoting President Roosevelt's
utterance on the Monroe doctrine and
imperialism made In his recent speech
of acceptance, draws the following pe
culiar deduction:
"Could the formidable 'Iron Chan
cellor' have said more? In fact, he
did practically say the same when he
undertook the construction of Ger
many. It Is not by Parliamentary
speeches nor by votes on majorities, but
by blood and fire, that great contem
poraneous . questions must be settled.
After forty years the soul of Bismarck,
the Minister of an ancient monarchy,
has passed Into the President of a
youthful democracy. Does not this
seem curious?^
The Priest's Cttrtains..
A well known attorney who lives In
tire Western Addition is blessed with a
family of six boys. Willie, the young
est. Is a great favorite of the parish
priest, who frequently dines with the
family. A few Sundays ago Willie
was taken to church for the first time!
He had been drilled how to behave
himself and he was a good little boy,
staring all around and never uttering
a word.
When the priest entered in his robes
Willie's eyes nearly bulged out of his
head. He tried hard to follow his
mother's advice to keep quiet but he
could not restrain himself. Nudging
one of his brothers next to him he said
so that he could be heard distinctly:
"Gee, Jlmmle, look at Father wlv
lace curtains on." He was promptly
led out of the church by his chagrined
mother and told that he was a very
naughty boy.

Jâ^NGLAND, traditionally reserved and conservative
1""* in the expression of political opinion, however
Â¦*â ' heated her domestic controversies may be, is now
in the midst of a political campaign that for violence of
invective, for extravagance of censure or of praise, ac
cording t# the point of view of partisans, may well rival
the boasted history of the American stump. For in
sinuation of unworthy motives, for denunciation of pub
lic conduct and methods, for sweeping allegations of
incompetency, we must look for models to our dis
turbed* and agitated British cousins, who have passed
through a barren but very bitter Parliamentary session
and now await with impatience the election and forma
tion of a new Government that may or may not satisfy
the politicians and the people of the nation.
In the great parliamentary battle which has been
fought for many months and which was ended by the
King a few days ago three great figures, representing
as many definitely defined public policies, were in the
English eye. Far above the others in public praise or
condemnation, lauded for qualities recognized by friendly
followers, or denounced for failures construed by the
desires of the opposition, was Mr. Balfour, the Premier.
Hardly second in the agitated gaze of the English
people, a master of empirical suggestion and reform or
a dangerous theorist trifling with the country and its
prosperity, as you please to look at him, was Joseph
Chamberlain, the nearest approach in England to the
manners and methods of an American statesman. And
then came Sir HenryMJampbell-Bannerman, who, in the
fire of controversy, has been characterized as the leader
of honest men, exposing the straightforward heresies of
Chamberlain and the dishonest subtleties of Balfour.
Through a long series of great debates, during which
seven desperate but futile attempts were made to oust
the- Government, these three men have been before the
English public as the shining marks for indorsement or
rebuke. And now, with Parliament adjourned, the coun
try rings with speculation regarding the character and
personnel of the next Government. A writer in the
Contemporary professing complete knowledge
of the situation, assumes that the next administration
will be a Liberal one, but as the presumption is evidently^
an expression of the hope of Lord Rosebery, it has been
advanced only to be assailed bitterly and vigorously.
As far as English public opinion may be sifted there
appear to be three available Liberal Prime Ministers,
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. . Lord Rosebery and
Lord Spencer. Subsidiary to this suggestion is another
.that the King should send for Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman and Lord Spencer as leaders of the "Opposi
tion and deputize the latter to form an administration.
While this brilliant scheme is hatching the other forces
are saying nothing to indicate their final purpose in the
organization of a new Government. Meanwhile partisan
papers are bristling with adjectives of abuse and giving
to America a few examples that encroach upon our
recognized supremacy . in this field of political cam
paigning.

Dear heart.. I lately passed beneath the

and sing;
I climbed great mountains where the

Faint odors from the vale of wheat and

In search of Peace. I stood where sol

Of preat Sierras rise, and torrents
fling ,"*
Mad music to the crags where cedars
cling,
Above old Ophlr*s wealth of yellow
mines:
But could not see her face. And then
-I stood
Where Merced, boasting of her awful
leap
Down the great cliffs of lone To

Sang, as she passed me near a cav

THE laws of modern war exempt non-combatants
from its ravages. This exemption does not merely
cover their exemption in actions at arms. It in
cludes their right to life and their means of existence.
Extending this principle, it means that they have the
right to a sufficient and uninterrupted food supply. Were
it otherwise non-combatant3 could be summarily starved
to death, which is more horrible than to be 'stricken in
battle.
Great Britain depends and will always depend upon I
an imported food supply. This accounts for her stren
uous objection to Russia making food contraband. This
question of food is a common tie of peculiar strength j
between the United States and Great Britain. We hav: j
the surplus food, she has the demand for it. No wonder, â¢
then, that she insists that the exclusion of non-combat
ants from the sphere of military vengeance shall cover
their right to have food and to live. If Russia, backed i
by the sympathy of Continental Europe, insist upon
making food contraband, it amounts to no less than a
decision for the extinction of Great Britain.
The interest of the United^ States in the issue is
scarcely second to that of Great Britain. Our prosper
ity depends upon a foreign market for our surplus food
and fabrics and fiber. If these are contraband, every
war anywhere is a blow at us, and we arc made 1 to suffer
its destructive consequences, although not a party to it
and innocent of its cause.
Russia is playing hard upon the Continental jealousy
of the United States and Great Britain. The advocates
of a united Continent to oppose the trade of the United
States are ready allies in her endeavor to rewrite inter
national law. Our demand for the protection of our
commerce will have no European sympathy outside of
Great Britain. With her our interests make common
cause. The question is far more serious than at first
appeared upon its face. It joins against us and Great
Britain the political enemies of her empire and the c6m
mercial enemies -of our trade. If Japan bring the war to a
speedy conclusion the issue may pass without a decision.
But, thqugh P.ort Arthur fall and the Baltic fleet share
the- doleful fate of its two predecessors in Eastern
waters, the possibility of getting help from other Con
tinental nations by this appeal to their political, and
ambitions may cause Russia to needlessly
prolong the war. Our people should comprehend the
gravity of the issue and prepare for action defensive of
our interests.

The problems of management pre- |
rented the bureau differ with changing ;
forest conditions and with the various 1
purposes of Its owners. The bureau I
field force examines the forests and 1
fimnts and measures the trees to de- |
termine the stand of each species, the
rate of growth and both present and
prospective yield In board feet. Hav
ing this information, and knowing the
habits of growth of different species,
the bureau is then in position to give
definite" advice as to the proper course
to pursue to attain by management
any specified end. #
This branch of the bureau's work is
of importance not only, to the owner*
of large timber tracts, but as well to
those whose holdings consist of merely
DO or 100 acres. The purpose of the
bureau is not to benefit any particular
owner or set of owners, but to en
courage and establish conservative for
estry everywhere for the general good
of the nation. Individuals derive di
rect benefits from this work, but the
knowledge and experience thus gained
by the bureau are for application to
whole sections and contribute to the
scientific knowledge and practice of
forestry-
There are now twenty-eight experts
conducting the commercial tree stud
ies under way in the four States above
mentioned. While these agents of the
bureau are on the ground, owners of
timberland? or small woodlots In those
States should s**lze the opportunity, so
conveniently' at hand, for obtaining a
preliminary examination of their hold-
Ings. This will be done by the bureau
without cost to them and would cer
tainly prove highly beneficial to their
Interests. The bureau is glad to re
ceive applications for such exam
inations.
Acing under its general co-operative
offer, the Bureau of Forestry Is now
preparing detailed working plans for
several tracts of timber belonging to
private owners In the States of West
Virginia. Kentucky. Tennessee and
North Carolina. Three of the problems
of management presented may be
brleily indicated. In Kentucky the
owner of a 40,000-acre tract wishes to
retain a large part of the property in
forest for continuous production of
railroad ties. In West Virginia a 30,
000-acre tract, the property of a min
ing company, must be made to main
tain a permanent supply of timbers
for use in the mines. In the same State
another working plan for' 5000 acres of
timberland aims to secure a steady in
come from the sale of the timber
grown.
This field season the Bureau of For
estry will complete certain studies of
important commercial trees in the
South. The species under investigation
ere yellow poplar, white, red, black
and oheptnut oak, chestnut, white pine
and hemlock- A great mass of data
has h^en collected as a basis for
tables showing the proportion of these j
species in various types Â¦ of the Ap- j
ralachian forest, the volume of mer- !
chantable limber and the rate of
growth of the several species. This
season trained men of the bureau will
pay special attention to the silvicul- j
tural characteristics and the commcr- j
cial possibilities of these trees.- They j
will also apply the information col
lected by the bureau in the last two â¢
years, embodying it in practical sug- 1
gestiorts for conservative forest man
agement by timberland owners of the |
South. j
The aim of a commercial tree study j
Is to secure the information necessary j
for the successful application of for- 1
estry where the tree forms an import
ant part of the forest crop. It In
volves, among other things, knowledge Â¦
of its methods of reproduction, that it '
may continue to form a part, and very
likely a larger part, of the forest, in
stead of being replaced, when lum
bered, by less available trees; of its
rate of growth, on which depends the
I calculation of future returns; of the
conditions of lfght, soil, moisture, etc..
under which It flourishes best; of its
ability to compete with the various
other species with which it is asso
ciated in the various types of forest
In which it occurs and what manage
ment can do to Improve conditions for
It; of when it will pay to plan for It
as part of a permanent timber-produc
ing forest, and of how it ought to be
lumbered to secure the largest present
and future returns. In the light of
the knowledge which such studies fur
nish, the forester is in a position to
make an Intelligent working plan for
tracts in which the trees studied form
or can be made to form a valuable
part of the stand of timber. In that
case lumbering does not mean ruining
the forest, denuding the ground and
leaving it barren or to grow up in
worthless brush, but a regular timber
output, while the forest constantly im
| proves in character and the value of
its growth.
Forest rv Problems.
Ed Wright, Tax Collector of Mendo
clno County, and Bob Duke, the well
known young lawyer of this city, have
just returned from a hunting trip
through the northern part' of the
State. Wright is authority for the fol
lowing:
"Just before taking the trail we en
tered the hotel in a small town for
luncheon. Seating ourselves at a table,
Duke ordered a bottle of choice wine
and two porterhouse steaks. Imme
diately afterward a typical back
woodsman and his helpmate drove up
in a prairie schooner, behind which
was tied a large hound. They entered
the dining-room, seated themselves at
our table and ordered some cold meat,
which they had almost finished when
our repast was brought in. Duke
poured , a glass of wine for himself
and one for me and we began eating.
"We had taken but a few mouthfula
when we were startled to see our
farmer friend reach for the bottle of
wine â which he evidently thought was
common property â atad generously fill
his capacious water tumbler and that
of his wife from our private stock.
Duke, having invited me to the wine,
was much embarrassed, but said noth
ing.
"When the farmer had drunk the
wine, however, and reached again for
the remainder of the bottle, my
friend's patience was exhausted, and,
flushing up, he arose and left the table
to seek the proprietor for an explana
tion. Before he had time to return
the bucolic gentleman, thinking Duke
> v had finished, reached over and dumped
1 the remainder of hi3 steak into a pa
per, with a remark about the small
ness of my friend's appetite and that
the meat would be good for his dog.
The couple then arose and drove pjf.
Just as Duke returned. My apprecia
tion of the comedy was so keen that I
was unable to answer his inquiries as
to the whereabouts of the steak until
the wagon was well, out of sight, -when
It came about that he gave another
but more varied order for refresh
ments, after which we went on our
way."

It* wag not buying the Panama canal and giving the
world's commerce a short cut between the great oceans.
All of these and other objects of expenditure necessary
to the general welfare were cared for in addition to
the objects of expenditure in i860. It is conceded that
expenses increase with population when there is no in
crease in the objects of expenditure, so, every item re
maining as in i860, in 1904 the increase following popu
lation should have made the per capita $5,005. With all
the new objects of expenditure, including the canal and
navy, Mr. Davis finds the per capita to be $7.10, or an
increase of only $2,095 over the extended ratio of i860.
If, however, he insist that any increase over the per
capita of i860 is evidence of wasteland extravagance, Mr.
Cleveland must have been a waster, for his per capita ex
ceeded that of i860 by $3.09! As Cleveland's per capita
was $5.10, Roosevelt has exceeded it by only $2, or
$1.09 less than Cleveland's excess over Buchanan. At
$7.10 expenditure per capita, our people are getting the
attention oC their Government to at least twice as many
useful objects as under Buchanan. Their Federal Gov
ernment is costing them now 59 cents plus a month per
capita. That is 14 and three-fourths cents a week plus,
or a little more than two cents a day. How much of
that two cents does Mr. Davis agree to knock off? The
Government is building a great navy, improving rivers
and harbors, has bought the Panama canal, aided agri
culture, inspected our meat exports, hunted down the
boll weevilj furnished a preventive of blackleg in cattle
and done more than any other people get from their
government. Will Mr. Davis agree to keep it all going
for less than 2 cents a day per capita?
This form of attack will be heard throughout the cam
paign. The citizen will be reminded that he is enslaved
and oppressed, degraded and impoverished by the impo
sition of two cents a day, for the enjoyment of the great
est, freest, best and most useful government on earth.
The cry is pitifully ridiculous.
MR. DAVIS, the Democratic nominee 'for the
Vice Presidency, has been told of his nomination.
Mr. Davis is fifty times a millionaire, and very
properly the scene of his notification was White Sulphur
Springs, an aristocratic resort in the mountains of West
Virginia. Mr. John Sharp Williams was selected to
spring the surprise on the venerable candidate, and did
it in one of his characteristic speeches, composed of
political ba"tiinage.
The venerable nominee responded. He has had much
political experience, having served twelve years in the
Senate. He refused re-election, went into partnership
with Rockefeller in the Standard Oil trust, and pro
ceeded to pile up his vast fortune. Like Rockefeller, he
began life in a laborious position and poor, and like
Rockefeller he is fond of boasting about it, and did not
forget to do so in his speech of acceptance. That part
of his speech into which he put the most emphasis re
lates to the cost and economy of government. He dis
covers-a deficit in the treasury, because for the fiscal
year ending June 30 the expenditures of the Government
exceeded the revenues by $4i,ooo,<5bo.
A candidate should not shuffle with figures nor misrep
resent the fiscal condition of his country.. The excess of
expenditures over receipts was caused by.the' cash pay
ment of $50,000,000 for the Panama'.canal and railroad,
and was paid out of the surplus remaining in the treasury
from 'the previous year. Yet Mr. Davis says: "There could
be no stronger evidence of the extravagance* into which
the Republican party has fallen and no more potent ar
gument in behalf of a change to the party whose tenets
have always embraced prudence and in admin
istering the people's affairs. The cost of government
has largely increased under Republican rule. The ex
penditures per capita for the last years respectively of
the administrations given, taken from the reports of
the Secretary of the Treasury, were as follows: In i860,
under Buchanan, $2.01; in 1893, under Harrison, $5.77;
j in 1897, under Cleveland, $5.10; in 1901, under McKinley,
I $6.56; in 1904, under Roosevelt. $7.10." '\
The population of the country in i860 was 31,000,000.
In 1904 it is 80,000,000, more than two and a half times as
I great. Therefore, if the Federal expenditures in the
latter year were only for the same objects as those of
i860, they should, to keep pace with the population be
two and a half times as great as under Buchanan. This
would bring the per capita up to $5,005, with the Gov
ernment doing no more for the navy, the army, and with
no increase in the objects of expenditure over i860.
But since then we have added to the Cabinet depart
i ments agriculture and commerce. In i860 the Federal
I Government was not maintaining jetties at "the mouth
1 of the Mississippi. It was not annually expending ten
millions to levee that stream and keep it from destruc
tively flooding the cotton, corn and cane lamls of the
South. It was not standing the cost of fighting the boll
i weevil to preserve the Southern cotton crop. It was not
annually expending millions to improve the harbors of
the country to accommodate our vastly increased com-
J merce. â¢ It was not "spending more millions to keep the
I Ohio from flooding the towns of West Virginia. It
was not building and maintaining a first-class navy, and
suffered for it_s neglect in the Civil War that came the
following year, finding its commerce exposed to the de
j struction that was wrought by the Confederate cruisers.

he gets, a depth of water sufficient to cover the land 5.7
feet, and that the ratio of land to water practically
varies every month in the year. Under the Yuma

inch to less than two acres of land, nearer to an acre
and a half... In the Klamath district in Northern Cali

PLACED UNDER ARREST
DISCOVERED IX TIME
Patsy Stevens, who once upon a time
was famed as a dictator of Democratic
politics on Telegraph Hill, had John
Mariano arrested for battery, the spe
cific otTense being Mr. Stevens' forcible
ejection from Mr. Mariano's saloon.
V.'hen the case was called before Judge
Earsfleld O'Brien, a former middle
weight champion pujrilist of the Pacific
Coast, was sentenced yesterday to six
months for vagrancy by Judge Con
lan. Then up spoke Dennis Gallagher,
similarly convicted.
"May It please the court." he said,
"Mr. O'Brien and I have been pals for
many years. Our relationship has
been that of Damon and Pythiasâ of
Jonathan and Davidâ and to deprive
me of his society for six months would
be a cruel blow to both of us. He, I
am sure, would say the same thing if
he were allowed to speak.
"Far be it from my Intention," said
the Judge, and his tone was even more
courteous than that of Mr. Gallagher,
"to sever the companionship of Mr.
O'Brien and yourself. You also shall
go to the County Prison and stay there
six months and If you tell the chief
Jailerâ a most humane gentleman â
what you have Just told me he may
find a way of affording you and Mr.
O'Brien occasional opportunity to ex
tend to each other renewed assurance
of distinguished consideration."
Mr. Gallagher hastened to state that
his plea was misunderstoodâ that It
was aimed to obtain a reduction of his
old pal's sentence instead of to have
six months prescribed for himself, but
the court waved him away impatiently.
And nobody seemed to enjoy Mr. Gal
lagher's discomfiture more keenly than
did Mr. Gallagher's old paL
Michael J. Crowley, formerly a Â»
ealoon-keeper at Fourth and Stevenson !
streets, appeared to have beÂ«n pretty I
well battered himself as he stood, be
fore Judge Cabanlss and pleaded not
guilty to the charges of battery and
peace disturbance filed by Patrolmen
McEntee and Welton. The flesh en
vironing his eyes was purple hued and
mountainous and other portions of his
countenance bore signs of recent rough
usage. He declared that his injuries
were inflicted by the patrolmen and
were unprovoked.
It was in the apartment of Jessie
Mason at 116 Sixth street that CrowleÂ£
was arrested at 5 o'clock yesterday
morning. He went to the room and
after vainly knocking for admittance
broke in the door. Shortly afterward
the woman ran out with his vest, in
v.hich he kept his money, and he fol
lowed her and recovered his property.
They returned to the room and the
two policemen were attracted by the
woman's screams for aid. When they
responded she declared she had only been >.
"fooling," but they arrested Crowley 1
just the same. They say he resisted
them so fiercely that they were com
pelled to use force to remove him.
while he declares he was peacefully
accompanying them when they beat
him with their clubs.
The hearing was set for next Thurs
day and the case promises to be an
Interesting one, as Crowley says he will
file charges against his accusers with
the Police Commission.

Joseph Carter had just been released
from serving a term of imprisonment
for ragrancy when he was again ar
rÂ»sted and charged with the same of
fense. Yesterday â¢when the case was
called before Judge Conlan an eloquent
young attorney made a strong plea in
his behalf, alleging he was an object of
malicious persecution by the police.
"Moreover," argued the pleader, "the
ten days' complaint filed, against this
defendant has been declared unconsti
tutional by the Supreme Court and the
police shculd be warned that they are
breaking the law when they Ignore
that ruling. I now move for a new
trial of this defendant."
"All right.** said the Judge; "I was
going to sentence him to six months,
but I guess the sentence can be de
ferred until to-morrow."
- Then the defendant rose from his
eeat in the cage and, advancing to the
bars, asked the Judge if he had not in
tended to impose a sentence of thirty
days instead of six months. "Because
If It's thirty days," he added, "I'll take
It right now."
"To be accommodating once more."
responded his Honor, "I'll make it
thirty days."
"Thank you," said the prisoner.
"You're- welcome," said the Judge.
The eloquent young attorney said
nothing but he looked as if he thought
things.

Mrs. Florence Balliet. wife of Letson
Balliet, a mining engineer, appeared
before Police Judge Fritz yesterday as
complaining witness against Edward
Larocheman, a restaurant waiter,
charged with disturbing the peace
night before last at the complainant's
residence, 613 Oak street.
Awakened by a noise at a rear win
dow of the house, Mrs. Balliet testified,
she thought it was made by Charles
E. J. Gallup, who lives there, trying to
effect an entrance, and she called out,
"Is that you, Charlie?" Instead of
Charlie, however, it turned out to be
the defendant, who broke a window in
his effort' to effect an entrance, thereby
greatly distressing the complainant and
her housekeeper, Sarah Stewart.
Larocheman denied that the object
of his visit was felonious. He had visited
the women before, he said, in response
to their invitation, and Mrs. Balliet had
instructed him always to enter through
the rear door. Finding the rear door
closed on the occasion in question, he
was endeavoring to ascertain if th*
window was also fastened when the
outcry was raised and his arrest fol
lowed.
He was pronounced guilty as charged
and will be sentenced to-day.
Cabaniss yesterday, however, there
was no apperance of the former boss
of the "Rock Rollers." and it was ex
plained to the court that after Mr.
Stevens became sober and was in
formed of what he had doce he ex
pressed regret and declared that Sir.
Mariano had treated him exactly right.
So dismissal was ordered.
â¢ * â¢
Robert Winert, bricklayer, gnawed
the ends of a luxuriant beard as he
faced Judge Cabaniss, and his stalwart
I frame trembled as if he were ague
stricken.
"Whatever this policeman says must
be right," he responded when asked
what he had to say relative to the
1 charge of drunkenness against him.
"I have been drunk so long that I re
member nothing very clearly, and if j
I don't get something to steady my j
I nerves I'm. afraid I'll never recover j
my memory."
He was sentenced to ten days' im
prisonment, and the bailiff* was in
structed to see that a heavy dose of
the prison preventive of delirium
tremens was immediately administered ]
to the Quaking wretch.
â¢ â¢ * :
Pat Shea, fruit peddler, was "sassy" j
to the policeman who arrested him for
ill-treating a horse by sawing with the
reins until the animal's mouth was
raw and bleeding, and he was "sassy"
} to Judge Conlan when that magistrate
asked him for an explanation of his
alleged conduct. His "sasslness" grad
ually evaporated, however, as the po
liceman went on to state that an addi- !
i tional charge of peddling without a
license had been filed against the de
fendant, nor was it revived by the
Judge pronouncing him guilty of both
charges and ordering him to appear
to-day for sentence. Â»
â¢ â¢ â¢
K. Tom, a wiry little Japanese, was
pronounced a miniature Jeffries-Fitz
i slmmons-McCoy-Sharkey by Patrol
j man Mills, himself no diminutive sped-'
men of physical manhood. The oracer
had heard of what a stack of. wildcats
could do In the way of keeping a hu
man opponent interested, but he was
ready to lay odds that subjugating
a mountain of Bengal tigers would
hardly prevent little K. Tom from laps
ing Into ennui. This exalted opinion
of K. Tom's prowess was based upon
personal experience. Never was
j tougher proposition than K. Tom's ar
rest tackled by any member of the San
Francisco police force who scorned to
resort to the us* of deadly weapons.
When the policeman had concluded
his tribute to K. Tom's worth as a
fighter the disclosure was made that
within the preceding fifteen days K.
Tom was arrested no less than five
different times for drunkenness and
disorderly conduct, and that he was
under bail In each of the three working
departments of the Police Court. In
defense of the little man's penchant
for Imbibing ardent liquids and break
ing the reace it was stated that he
was peculiarly susceptible to patriotic
promptings, and that each victory of
his countrymen over the Slav im
pelled him to indiscreet celebration.
"Then the best place for him," quoth
Judge Conlan, "is the County Jail.
where war news is suppressed. I'll
give him six months for battering the
policeman and three 1 months for dis
turbing the peace, and by the timÂ» he
has served those terms white-winged
peace may be hovering o'er the Orient."

Although she failed a few months
ago to get a divorce from Ernest F.
Jurgensen, Lydia Jurgensen still has
faith in the power of the courts to
free her from the ties that gall.
Her husband is a letter carrier earn
ing 550 a month and is receiving $3 a
month pension as a Spanish "War vete
ran. They were married at Rochester,
N. Y., in 1SS5 and have three children.
On December 21 she sued him for
divorce on the ground of cruelty. On
February 25 he filed a cross complaint
charging her with infidelity with one
John Glover. The court denied the
application of both for divorce, but
under the separation which necessarily
followed awarded the mother the cus
tody of the children and rave the
father permission to visit them.
In the second suit for divorce b*run
by Mrs. Jurgensen yesterday she
charges that Jurgensen has used the
permission of the court to visit her
home, 1207% Stevenson â¢ street, for the
purpose of beating and kicking her and
abusing the children. She savs", too,
that he continues to cause her anguish
by circulating false stories regarding
her chastity. She ha^ him arrested
for battery and he was convicted on
June 24, but escaped with a light sen
tence on the promise not to annov her
'again. He failed to keep the promise.
Judge Murasky yesterday declined to
grant the divorce asked by Dora Trud
gen from Daniel A. Trudgen. The case
has been under submission for some
weeks and the evidence wa3 chiefly
upon depositions. At Sutter Creek,
Amador County, on August 27, 1901.
Trudgen, then nineteen years old. was
arrested on a serious charge preferred
by Dora Chase. It was agreed that the
prosecution should be dropped if he
would marry the girl. After the mar
riage he left her, coming next day to
San Francisco, where he started to
learn the barber trade. In. his defense
he set forth that an agreement in "writ
ing was made whereby he was not to
be called upon to support his wife or
her child and that she should com
mence a suit for divorce. The agree
ment was never signed. The girl
worked as a domestic at various places
after her marriage.
Suits for divorce were filed by John
C. .Westenberg against Cynthia E.
"VVestenberg for desertion; Gustave
Hede against Loretta Hede for her
| habitual intemperance; Mary Alice !
I Monroe against Barton Gates Monroe
i for neglect and desertion; H. T. Lally

"BEE" BRAND CEYLON TEA sells for 50c, 60c, 80c and $1.00 per pound.
Read what the importers and sellers of this high-grade tea have to say of it:
"In our judgment 'Bee' brand is the best quality Ceylon tea and the best value for the money.
We have imported it for ten years. Each importation (and they come four times a year) is
â¢larger than the previous one. Ceylon Tea is picked by hand, but thereafter it is rolled and handled
entirely by machinery. This obviates the accumulation of perspiration by delicately scented \
leaves. The far-seeing Englishman finds the commercial advantage of modern methods outweigh |
its cost. (Signed), GOLDBERG, BOWEN & CO." <

FORMER GOLF CADDIE
DEFEATS THE CHAMPION"
This was not the first stamp mill
erected in California, though it is the
only one of the earliest that is in ex
istence. The honor of having put up
the first stamp mill belongs to John
Sime, who is still living, at the age of
84, in French Gulch (a Frenchman
probably blazed the trail Into this de
pression), Shasta County, though the
voice of the mill is stilled forevdr and
its fragments are scattered by the
stream. Sime's mill was in Nevada
County.
Californians at the fair gaze In rev
erence upon the old mill. Its jarring
growl as it munched its flinty food
startled the solitudes of Shasta when
San Francisco was yet a babe among
cities and before any one deemed a
connecting thread of steel from ocean
to ocean possible. The echo of those
two noisy stamps lives in the hum and
bustle of a growing State that gold
started on its way to greatness.
The names of the men who erected
the old mill are lost In the "dim dawn
of history." There were two of them
and they took about 565.000 out of a
pocket thev worked on the old Trinity
mine. Their mill reduced about 300
pounds of ore a day, about a ton a
week. It was worked by a six-foot
overshot wheel and had a mortar fif
teen inches long and a foot wide. The
stamp rods were of wood and the iron
shoes, which weighed but sixty pounds
each, were made in San Francisco. The
wood used in construction was Cali
fornia cedar and it has stood the teat
of time well.
MAKERS ARK UXKXOWX.
Madeira, when he saw the venerable
relic, dismounted at once and began
investigating like a connoisseur. Over
the framework and a wheel that the
waters had once known as a playfellow
blackberries and honeysuckle had
grown. He tore some of them away
and a battery of two crude stamps that
had been worked by a cam consisting
of a clumsy wheel with two round
pieces of wood projecting from its rim
was revealed. The framework was
there, all intact. Madeira had acciden
tally stumbled on the oldest quartz
mill extant in California. He had found
a prize. He was then on his way from
Delta to Trinity Center, in Shasta
County, to secure some material for
Mineralogist Aubury, to be used in the
California display at St. Louis. On his
way he crossed Hell Creek and Dam
nation Gulch. This will in no way
shock the residents of Trinity Center,
for these are actual names and the
people there are thoroughly used to
them; they are even taught in the
geography class of the district school,
so the little ones speak them trippingly
and with no false modesty. He wasn't
looking for anything startling on Dog
Creek and that's why he made a strike
there.
Mndeira found upon investigation
that the Bank of Shasta owned the old
mill and didn't know it. It had never
known the venerable quartz pulverizer
was in existence. He asked for It in
the name of the State} and the bank
readily consented to present it to Cali
fornia. Banks have no sentiment in
such matters. To them the only kind
of a mill that looks good is one that is
running.
The relic of the gold days was
brought to the exposition and set up in
the mining gulch here, just as it had
stood for fifty-one' years in its moun
tain fastness. Standing near an up-to
date mill that can make powder out of
more rock in an hour than it could re
duce in a week, the Dog Creek veteran
serves to- illustrate the evolution of the
stamp mill in California.

WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS, Aug. 18.
Riding one day not long before the
opening of the St. Louis Exposition
through a wild portion of Shasta Coun
ty, George Madeira, one of State Miner
alogist Aubury's assistants, observed
something near a stream known by the
homely but truly '49 title of Dog Creek
that looked like some sort of a stamp
mill that might have been used, judg
ing from its ancient appearance, by the
Chinese who were supposed to have
blown across to the California shores
centuries ago and then resolved them
selves into Indians in order that they
might have even less to worry about
than they did as Chinamen. Dog
Creek, it may be said, is one of those
names bestowed by men who hadn't
been tenderly reared and given a clas
sical education, and who didn't know
enough about the trouble over Helen
or of Hannibal's campaigns to make
California's picturesque early-day cen
ters of population appear ridiculous by.
giving them names that couldn't walk
on the same side of the street with a
red shirt or a faro layout. The early
day men, who paved the way with bean
kettles, navy plug and profanity,
named a new camp after the object
that appeared most prominent at the
time of locating the site. If the re
mains of a hapless canine that had
gone to its wolf ancestors lay distended
in the stream, that stream became Dog
Creek, and if a hungry burro brayed
in the hillside where a new diggings
lay, the town that sprang up was Jack
ass Hill, and so the donkey's bray went
round the world. There was nothing to
mystify and make one feel uncomfort
able without a cravat. If a few roman
tic youths with long hair and newly
acquired A. B. degrees had .had the
stamina to reach the golden land there
would have been a different set of
names and Bret Harte would have been
impossible.

By an almost unanimous vote a reso
lution has been carried in favor of an
amendment to the State Constitution
providing working hours for drug store
clerks and also making legal the clos
ing of all barber shops on Sundays. Do
nations amounting to $10 were voted
to the striking stablemen and 525 to
the locked out Oakland butchers.
Union No. 6 (hog butchers) has elect
ed the following officers:
The Stablemen's and Hackmen's
unions are desirous of bringing about
peace with the Carriage and Stable
Owners' Association. "With this object
in view another conference has been
asked for. It is claimed that the Fu
neral Directors' Association is anxious
to see a better feeling existing between
the carriage owners and their drivers,
as the present strained relations ham
pers their business to a certain ex
tent.
The question was fully discussed at
the last meeting of the Stablemen's
Union with a view to Induce the Car
riage and Stablemen's Association to
consent to one more conference. It is
claimed that P. H. McCarthy, presi
dent of the Building Trades Council,
and Secretary O. A. Tveitmoe will ex
tend their good offices if solicited to do
so,. As they are outside parties they
would be in a better condition to dis
cuss impartially the situation and ar
rive at terms agreeable to both sides.
On the part of the Carriage and
Stable Owners' Association there Is one
positive condition that must be agreed
upon. They will Insist on the "open
shop" lines,, holding their right to em
ploy whom they may see fit without
reference to union membership.
Arrangements are being made by the
butchers affiliated with their several lo
cal unions for the annual outing at
San Jose on Sunday, September 4, at
which place a barbecue will be enjoyed.
This feast and the joy attending the
day's outing can be had for the fare of
$1 to and from the Garden City, with
half price for children.
Manager Ezra Decoto settled all
doubt about the probabilities of the big
football game hot being played on tha
new gridiron this year i. by an
nouncing to-day that not only would
the varsity game be played there, but
the freshmen game, too. According to
the contract -with the builders of the
field it must be ready by November 1,
else there will be a heavy penalty, so
that Manager Decoto felt sure of .his
ground when he announced Berkeley as
the scene of the next conflict. Accom
panying the announcement is the
schedule of games that will be played
before the intercollegiate contest, which
will occur in November. The schedula
Is as follows:
Varsity against Olympics, September
24 and October 8; Sherman Institute
Indians, October 1; Oregon University,
October 22; Freshmen-Stanford, Oc
tober 15; Pomona College, October 22;
University of Nevada, November 5.
Practice will begin on August 29. \
Pursuant to a request from the mem
bers of the University of California
Club the new field has been dubbed
"California Field."

WHEAT â The foreign markets ruled firm
yesterday, with higher futures. Chicago
opened lc lower at $1 07%, advanced to
$1 09 and closed at $1 06%, a net loss for the
day of 2c. The decline was caused by a rise
in the temperatures in the Northwestern
States and Manitoba, where frosts had been
threatened.
This market, as far as futures were con
cerned, followed Chicago and lost 2c on the
morning session. The volume of business also
fell off considerably, as the big buyers of the
past several days were no longer in the mar
ket, and the bears were again in the ma
jority. In direct opposition to this decline in
futures, however, was an advance In the .cash
grain, as will be seen by the quotations.

market was weak at unchanged rates, as all ;
shipping orders had been filled on the pre- |
ceding day and stocks were still too heavy ,
for the regular trade to absorb. Sweet Po- ,
tatoes were wanted for shipment north and
cleaned up well at the recently revised quota
tions. The top quotation for Onions was .
shaded by laree handlers, but the market was
fairly active and steady at the decline.
Changes in miscellaneous vegetables were
slight. All descriptions were In free supply
and the market - generally had a weak tone.
Tomatoes cold at a lower range, as supplies
were more pl-entiful and the cool weather
checked the demand.

Poultry and Game.

ment in large young fowls, but supplies were
well un to requirements and prices were with
out quotable change. Old and small Chickens

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
All quotation* Â¦ remain undisturbed. Every
thing ' In the Butter market was weak and !
dull except strictly fancy creameries, which
were in light supply and steady. Cheese con
tinued plentiful. Both buyers and sellers
eeemed satisfied with the quotation of 30c for
the' best Eggs, hence there was little inclina
tion to change it.
Receipts were 75,200 lbs Butter, 727 cases
Eggs and 9300 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The fruit market was unusually active * dur
ing the early trade, as in addition to the
regular demand for local wants, there was
a eood inquiry for superior quality offerings
In small packages for shipment on the Puget
Bound steamer. The best offerings of Peaches
and Bartlett Pears in wrappers brought bet
ter prices, but â¢ the market was overloaded
with low grade offerings of both descriptions,
which were pressed for sale at irregular rates,
and some very qpor lots were offered below
the quotations. Plums, Prunes and Nec
tarines in crates met with a good 5 call for
shipment aÂ«d cleaned up well at steady rates.
Grapes were plentiful and sold at a wide range
as to Â¦ variety. - Muscats sold for shipment at
75@S5c r>er crate; -Blacks brought 65@75c. and
Tokay touched $1. - Small and open boxes of
all varieties were plentiful and weak, except
fancy Muscat, which brought the top quota
tion. , Fancy Apples were firmly held , and the
bc*t Gravenstelns in four-tier packages
readily commanded the top quotation. - Can
talcupes and Nutmeg Melons continued to ar
rive freely and were a drug on the market.
Berries were in good â¢ supply and prices
showed little change. Two boxes of Pome
granates were : received from San . Joaquin
County and were held at $1 25 per box, and
Winter Nellis Pears from Courtland brought
$1 per box. .â¢ -
Plums, Prunes. Bartlett Pears and Peaches
in' bulk 1 continued very dull, as . the . canners
were still overloaded with contract supplies

a tendency to make the market stronger. Ma
terial, advances on all kinds may be expected
at any time.

NEW YORK. Aug. 18.â The stock market
had to contend with some depression 1 to-day.
as it had yesterday, and. although it made
headway against the depression, the recovery
and the later strength w<rÂ« by no means so
decisive as yesterday. The factors which
eecmed to make for reaction were not as much
in evidence, fith-r, as they were In the move
ment which confidently ignored them. The
action of th? crain markets to-day -was con
si Jeratly less alarmins from the viewpoint of
an owner of securities. The feverish tone of
wheat and the continued rec^rts of news of
damag-e to spring wheat did- not obscure - the
inclination to take Droflts in that commodity.
Higher ternpÂ»ra tares -in the Northwest re
lieved the immediate apprehension of harm
frcm frost. Rains in the corn belt also fur
nished th-j disired element for .rescue from
harm, which is regarded rather as a threat
to that -.top than accomplished fact. But
the (rrain-carrylng roads showed but languid
strength at any time. Reports of gross earn
ings for the second week of August were uni
formly favorable, with the ; soie exception of
Denver and Rio Grande, which showed a de
cline from last year's corresponding period of
ever 21 rer cent. YÂ«-t that stock shot up over
2 points. The demtnd for it was attributed
to London account. â¢ Tbe. buying of Erie
was eald to come from the same
source. Foreign holdings of the stocks
are on a large scale, and operations in
thiÂ»m for foreign accounts are given special
attention,. Missouri, Kansas and Texas was
said to be bought to-day for account of
Amsterdam. There were several other centers
of positive streneth in the market to help on
the contest with the depression. The local
tractiuns were the subject of a demonstra
tion which comprehended the whole group for
the first time since the current movement set
in. Manhattan ted with a rise of more than
3, and Inter-Borough on the curb rose
with equal violence. Repetition of old merger
rumors were the only explanation, and the
group reacted sharply. The advance in the
emeltlnt? stocks was attributed to the pending
negotiations Tor a union of leading Interests
and to good current earnings. The rise in
Amalgamated Copper was partly In sympathy
with that In smelting. The strength of the
Eries helped the other coalers, and Pennsyl
vania's rood tone was due to the progress
making in the soft coal trade. The develop
ment of th~se Eoints of strength in a seriea
proved effective In overcoming the early heavi
ness, due to the break of over 2 points in
Sugar and to the renewed pressure on United
States Steel rrcforred. The fear, of a war
of Drice cuts in the steel trade was a weight
upon the market and received much discus
sion. The market sold off sharply in the last
hour, but in the final dealing's there was a
rally - led by Amalgamated Copper, and the
closing was firm, with the gains pretty welf
maintained. The market was noticeably
spotty all day. and the mat's of the railroad
list did not share in the strength of special

STOCK MAEKET.
CHICAGO Aug. 18.â Wheat had a weak j
opening because of failure of predicted frost |
in the Northwest and reports indicating a
probable yield In the Northwestern States in
excess of that of last year. September was
dewn l@l%c at $1 07 to $1 07% at the open
ing and declined on heavy liquidation to
$1 06%. December showed a loss in the
opening trades of l@HsC to2%c at $1 07 to
$1 OS and soon receded to $1 06%. Then oc
curred a eensational rally. A report issued
by a Minneapolis crop expert Intimated the
spreading of black rust through hitherto prom
ising fields in the British Northwest. In its
wake* came telegrams from Winnipeg direct
describing total or partial crop destruction of
two-thirds of the wheat area of Manitoba.
The nervousness of the trade found expres
sion in sudden leaps and tumbles of prices.
September sold at $1 03 and December $1 00%
before the feverish rush of buying was satis
fied. Then the trade paused and took a sur
vey. Â¦ News in the meantime from the three
Mg wheat States, Minnesota and North and
South Dakota, gave conflicting: estimates of
the seriousneFs of crop damage. One report
which apparently received muchÂ» credence was
.to the effect that with favorable weather there
Btates will equal last year's production. Sim
ilar advices caused a divided sentiment among
traders with a preponderance of bearishness.
Long lines taksn on in thÂ« early rush came
out and scalpers contributed heavy Eelllng or
ders. September broke to $1 00%. rallied on
a last effort of the bulls to hold prices up
and sank back to $1 06%, where it closed
weak. December declined to $1 07%, rallied
to $1 0S% and closed also weak at $1 07%@
1 07%.
In the corn market September opened with
a loss of %Â®lHc at 53%@54%c. December
was down H^&c to ft@%c at 54@54%e. It
closed weak at a loss of v'ic September de
clined to 53Hc, closing easy at 53%@53%c.
In oats ' September opened l%c lower at
34%o and sold off to 34%c on the early de
clines. . The close wÂ«i3 easy at 34%c.
â¢ Provisions were active and higher. The
local run of hogs was much smaller than an
ticipated and this, stimulated the demand.
Higher cables wore also a factor In advanc
ing: prices. September pork closed 20c higher
at $11 77%. Lard was up 7%c at $S 05. Ribs j

Injured While Boarding Car.
Up to the hour of adjourning his
court yesterday Judge Murasky had
made no order determining the cus
tody of 15-year-old Georgia Dunlap,
whose mother Is accused of treating
her inhumanly. It Is probable, how
ever, that the custody will be given to
the mother with the understanding
that the girl shall be placed in some
proper home or institution. The Judge
did not hear the case in open court,
but had a long interview^with Georgia
and her mother in his chambers. Lat
er, in court, he heard the views of the
attorneys and Secretary "White of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children.
Mrs. Jennie Dunlap, the mother,
filed an answer to the petition of
White for letters of guardianship over
the girl, in which she denied the ac
cusations of cruel treatment and said
that she had done all that a mother
could do for her daughter.
The mother declared that Mrs. A.
Taylor, with whom the girl has been
living, was an unfit person to care for
her because of idle and dissolute hab
its and for reasons specified Mrs. Tay
lor's home at 528. Hyde street was r.ot
a proper place for the girl to live. The
mother said that Mrs. Taylor had en
ticed Georgia from- home and had
called, upon the S. P. C. C. to aid her
in keeping the child.

CASE OF DCXLAP GIRI>
NOT SETTLED BY COTTRT
Since the retirement a year and a
half ago of the former proprietor of
"The Louvre" restaurant at Eddy and
Powell streets, many important im
provements have been made by its
present owner, Mr. Jesse Meyerfeld. It
has been Mr. Meyerfeld's aim to make
"The Louvre", the most popular cafe
on the Pacific Coast and that his ef
forts â¢ have received encouragement is

Judge Davis asked Professor Finger
why the minute book showed so much
friction in the various votes taken by
the board. When an applicant would
apply for registration on credentials
Searby in most cases voted opposite
to the rest of the board. Finger re
plied that Searby had been running
the board for a number of years past,
and that they did not intend to be run
by an Englishman any longer. Searby
resigned from the board in 1901.
Finger asked that the following ques
tion, which had been put by Senator
Lukens, be withdrawn: "In any rase
where a person applying for registra
tion on credentials, did he or she pre
sent as a part of the credentials let
ters or word from the Governor or
any other high official of the State, di
recting the board to pass on the certi
ficate?" Lukens thereupon withdrew
the question.
The commission on Monday will in
vestigate the amphitheater where the
examinations are held.
these -cases he was certain that the
applicants were qualified as pharma
cists.
At the evening session Secretary Cal
vert was questioned if he had ever tu
tored any students for these examina
tions. He replied that teaching was
his profession and that he would re
ceive any student who desired to take
a course in chemistry. It was found
on the registration book that a student
named Briggs was instructed by Cal
vert and took the examination in April.
Much friction prevailed among the
members of the State Board when Pro
fessor Searby was a member. It seems
that Searby, who was a member of
the chemistry department of the Uni
versity of California, rented the board
a dingy room back of his drug store on
Sutter street in which to hold meetings.
They left this place for their present
quarters on Fourteenth street, which
afforded better accommodations. This
angered Searby and he generally took
the opposite side to the other members
of the board on questions coming be
fore it.

Colonel Thomas Fitch, attorney, poli
tician and orator, was among the ar
rivals on the Siberia yesterday. The
colonel is at present quartered at the
Palace Hotel, but expects to leave to
night for his home in the south. Poll
tics, as ever, uppermost in his
mind, and his first questions were re
garding the political situation. When
assured that there had been no for
mal opening of the campaign beyond a
ratification his eyes brightened and his
broad face was wreathed in smiles.
"Then," he said, "I have done just
Regarding his plans and movements
during the coming campaign Colonel
Fitch had little to say. He may stump
the State and he may not. On one
point, however, he is positive. He will
not go East. Upon his arrival at the
Palace yesterday Colonel Fitch received
letters inviting him to speak in
Michigan, New York. Indiana and Illi
nois. Other letters relating to his pri
vate business have compelled him to
decline these invitations, but he inti
mates that he is at the service of the
party in this State when called upon.
As to the present status of the cam
paign Colonel Fitch said: "I have been
in Honolulu for two months and our
reports of what is going on were very
meager. This much I will say, Roose
velt has a hard fight on his hands.
Bryan's half-hearted support of Parker
was the best thing in the world to
bring the Democrats into line. The
members of that party who were afraid
of Bryan's monetary policy and voted
the Republican ticket have confidence
in Parker and will stay by him.
"The capitalists, who without dis
tinction of party, have been contribut
ing freely to prevent the calamity of
the election of Bryan, will withhold
their contributions. Many will support
the Democratic party for the hetero
doxical reason that it will not do what
it says it will.
"They were fooled in 1892. So far as
that goes it was not so much what the
party actually did, but what it might
have done had it kept its promises that
caused the disaster."
Colonel Fitch is confident" that Roose
velt will be elected and sees. the chief
danger in over-confidence. All must
work, and work hard, he says, to se
cure his election.
what I wanted to do. I have opened
the campaign for Roosevelt in mid
ocean, between the California coast and
the new Insular possessions. On the
deck of the Siberia I talked for an hour
and a half for the Republican party and
my speech was met with salvos of
applause. A vote taken on that steamer
would have almost unanimously been
for Roosevelt."

ilics Lena S. Walton, one of the
richest mine owners In Nome, waa ar
rested yesterday by Policeman Pyle on
a warrant charging her with obtaining
money by false pretenses. The com
plaining witness is Max Gutter of Ala
in eda, who returned from Nome on
Monday and was arrested on Wednes
day for passing a "gold brick" on Elfan
Conn of the Crossley building last May.
The Â¦warrant was sworn to before Po
lice Judge Fritx.
Miss Walton arrived from Nome on
Monday. Gutter alleges that he paid
Miss Walton $1000 for a 510,000 Interest
in the Gold Bug mine, about four miles
from Nome. It was located in Novem
ber, 1SS9. He was to manage the mine,
as Miss Walton had told him tljat the
clean-up would be heavy. When he
got to Nome he alleges he discovered
that Miss Walton had sold her Interest
la the mine to L. D. French. He also
found that other shares he had pur
chased from Miss "Walton In mining
claims were worthless and he was
altogether out 56000. She had promised
to return him the $1000 at Nome, later
in Seattle, where she said she had $15,
Â©00 In bank, and finally promised to
grive him the coin on her arrival here.
Miss Walton explains that she turned
all her property over to French in trust
snd that deeds on record will prove her
assertion. Gutter got a deed for his
chare in the Gold Bug mine and also
a deed from her trustee. She promises
to make it interesting for Gutter before
she is done with him and declares that
Attorney Tausxky, who represents her,
is in possession of documents that will
turn the tables on Gutter. She said:
Rowley was asked if the board had
ever been accused of being charged
with giving registration to certain per
sons on credentials simply because they
had a political pull. Rowley admitted
that the board had never been directly
accused, but as in cases with public of
ficials, there are always* rumors floating
around.
Professor Maloney was asked if he
had ever objected to issuing licenses to
parties who presented credentials. He
replied that he had not, that in each of
"It certainly seems to me," said
Judge Davis, "that a man would be
come rusty after that period of non
practice." ,
The case of Dr. Shaw was given for
an example. He came from another
State with good credentials to the
board. They refused to register him
and compelled him to take the examin
ation, in which he failed.
JUDGE DAVIS DISSATISFIED.
The afternoon was spent in exam
ining Professor Rowley, president of
the board. The commission questioned
him in regard to charging registration
fees to members who had not prac
ticed chemistry for several years and
if it was according to the State law to
demand back fees for years that a man
was not practicing. Rowley seemed
very weak on this point of the phar
macy law. It was also cited in the case
of C. Gilbride, who had discontinued
the practice of medicine for the period
of ten years, that he should be given
right to resume his practice as a li
centiate by simply paying his back ar
rearage.
Professor Flint's star pupil, George
C. Harvey, upon whom the professor
offered to wage the sum of 55 that he
would come out with the highest per
centage, admitted that the professor
talked to him during the course of the
examination but that it was only to
question him as to how he was pro
gressing.
Williard Kingsbury. a cousin of M'Â«5S
Fischer, told of how he went before the
board and asked it to reconsider
the ratings of Miss Fischer's papers.
He asked to be shown the papers of his
cousin but was refused. Later when
he told the board that he was a cousin
of Miss Fischer and was looking out
for her interests he was shown the pa
pers.
Further testimony was heard yes
terday by the commission appointed
by Governor Pardee to investigate the
workings of the State Board of Pharm
acy. Robert C. Jackson, who passed
the > examination for licentiate, gave
some damaging testimony.
Professor Flint of the faculty of phy
sicians and surgeons took the stand
and was examined as to why he should
be allowed the same privileges as an
examiner In being: present during the
progress of the examination. He said
that he had the interest of his pupils at
heart and that he did not assist them
in any way. He thought his presence
might be of encouragement to his stu
dents during the ordeal.
Robert C. Jackson took the stand and
after some severe cross-examining ad
mitted that he had seen Miss Clorain
Fitzgerald assist one of the students of
the College of Physicians and Sur
geons. She had concealed in her stock
ing a book on toxicology, from which
she procured answers to some of the
questions. He also testified that Pro
fessor Flint moved freely about the
room but could not say that he as
sisted any one.
