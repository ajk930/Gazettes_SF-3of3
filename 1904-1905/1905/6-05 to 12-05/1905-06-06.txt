Late Governor General of. St
Petersburg Now Absolute
Dictator in Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 6. 3:03 a. m.â
Emperor Nicholas* ukase virtually creat
ing Governor General Trepoff dictator has
given rise to a mighty sensation. It' ls.
the imperial recognition of the crisis In
the Internal affairs of Russia and in
stinctively recalls the step taken by the
Emperor's grandfather* Alexander 11, im
mediately after the attempt to ' blow up
the Winter Palace in ISBO. when he ap
pointed a commission of public safety,
headed by General Loris-Melikoff , except
that the position of General Trepoff will
be '; more * analogous to that occupied by
Loris-Melikoff when, later in the same
year, he was appointed Minister of the
Interior^ with full control of the police.
"Reaction and repression" doubtless will
be the quick interpretation put upon the
Emperor's act as soon as it becomes

umns of the Official Messenger and-com
ing almost without warning, the ukase is
not yet generally known, but to the in
itiated the : future of Constantine . Petro
vitch Pobyedonostseff, chief procurator of
the^ holy \u25a0 synod . . looms large.- Behind - the
scenes the old man, remains as stem and
as uncompromising as ever.'~He left what
many believed to be J hi3 deathbed last
Thursday and ; went to Tsarskoe-Selo.
where he spent almost the entire day with
his Majesty.
POWER OF POBYEDOXOSTSEFF.
The , decision to place in the" hands of
the strongest executive In Ku3sl#, which
Trepoff is universally recognized as be
ing. -the power to crush with in iron
grasp the political agitation which has
brought Russia almost to the brink of
revolution, according to public belief, ia
the fruit of Pobyedonostseft's visit, for so
far as can be learned, not a single ona
of the Emperor's Ministers was in the
secret. . / â¢
The iikaic came like n holt (roxn a
clear aky. . Dualism n. Minister of the
Interior, eonld not lace the humt.VHtion
and Immediately resigned, ami It 1Â» \u25a0 ynt
Improbable that other Minister* wif>
follow suit. It Is rumored In the city
that Count Ijamsdorff, tbe foreign M ln-'
later, has already placed hi* reslgna-,
(lon lc th- hands of the Emperor ami
that he will be succeeded by JMuravlelT,
former Minister of . Jastlee and Â» now
Embansador at Rome. Admiral Alexleft
ha.Â« also demanded the acceptance of
his demission.
To find a precedent for the resignation
of a; Minister as a protest against impe
rial action it is necessary to go back to
the resignations of Ministers Loris-lleli
kofT. Milutln and Ignatleff. when, after
the assassination of Alexander 11. Alex
ander 111 repudiated the liberal policy oÂ£
his father by issuing his. famous mani
festo affirming the maintenance of the
autocracy and of orthodoxy, which stirred
the chancellories of Europe to their
depths and marked the beginning of . the
reactionary policy that has lasted until
the present liberal . agitation was begun.
Stunner, an extreme reactionary, who be
longs to the Yon Plehwe school, it is re
ported at this writing, will succeed M.
Boullsan as Minister of tha Interior, but
it matters little who may succeed to that
portfolio, as its holder will be a subor
dinate 'to General Trepoff in all matters
affecting politics.
- In spite ' of the popular interpretation.
however, that Trepoff's appointment
means repression and reaction to the bit
tar end.' the latter conclusion by no means
follows, as It was under Lorls-Mellkofrs
dictatorship that the reform programme
of Alexander . II was worked out. The
same thing may prove true In this case. |
Indeed, among the contradictory rumors
whlchare- current in the city. one is that
the ukase will be completed with the im
mediate calling of a Zemsky Sobor. but
nothing is definitely known," and the Em
peror's .most influential friends are not
aware as to what ' stand he will - take.
Whatever he may do, it 'to now apparent
that the "> Emperor has decided that tha
hands of the Government shall no longer
be forced by political agitation, and that
the ! legislative assembly shall bear tha
hall mark of Imperial fashioning,' and not
that. of popuar clamor.
-The decision of the Emperor was un
doubtedly precipitated "by the Russian
disaster in the Sea of Japan, as liberal j
and radicals everywhere were preparing
to make the bast possible use of it in fur
thering their.wishes.

TOKip. June s.â The following an
nouncement was made to-day from the
headquarters of the Japanese armies in
Manchuria.:
One Hundred Men.
Japanese Inflict I/OÂ»Â« of More Than
Regarding the general situation. It can
be announced <hat Europe regards the
Prosirjrnt as the most available medium
for the preliminary communications be
tween St. Petersburg and Toklo, and both
Count Cassir.i, the Russian Embassadar,
and Takahira are convince of the Presi
dent's sincerity and friendliness to both
belligerents in his conferences regarding
the ending of the war.
Whatever may be the result of the im
portant conference the President had with
Count Cassini. tho exchanges between
"Washington and the European capitals
aro gradually bringing about a thorough
understanding among the neutral powers
which will enable them to present a
united front whfn peace negotiations do
begin. European advices received here
indicate that the neutral powers are in
clined to share the President's aversion
to an international conference and that
they are inclined to the belief that all
interests can best be served by direct ne
gotiations between the belligerents.
The President, it is believed, will en
deavor to keep Japan's peace terms within
reasonable bounds, and the close relations
of Emperor William to the Czar, it is
suggested, will tnable the German sov
ereign to advise the Czar with a frank
ness that even the Washington Govern
ment could not assume. Takahira said
to-night: â
â¢â¢Tokio is always for peace; but, - he
added significantly. "Russia must first
rÂ«alire the- present situation in all its se
riousness and be prepared to face it."
Meantime, with the assistance of Taka
hira, the President Is acquainting him
ff)t as fully as possible with the views
of tho Japanese Government on the sub
ject of peac?. It is realized by the Wash
ington Government that the Mikado has
a formidable war party In Japan to cope
\u25a0with, and this is one of the reasons why
it is difficult for Tokio to give Washing
ton <Irfinito information about what the
terms would be in the light of Admiral
Tozo's latest victor>
The President was unable to give Taka
hira any intimation of how Russia has
viewed the annihilation of her fleet, and
until Co<T!!t Cassini's report on his visit
to; the White House has been replied to
from St. Potrr.^bure no further progress
toward peace can be made in that direc
tion.
Thus far the Japanese.. Minister has not
bt-Vr. able to tell the President except in
the most gf-rfeTal and. unofficial way what
Japan is likely tÂ» demand of Russia when
the lattt-r can b*-* brought to discuss
ptacf. Even the Minister himself has no
idea what Japan's indemnity may amount

respondent 'of . the' Daily Mail says it
is reported that seven Japanese j tor
pedo-boat destroyers are waiting off
Corregidor Islands. The same corre
spondent says that the breechlocks on
the three Russian cruisers have been
temporarily removed.
MANILA, June 6.â Major General
Corbin at 10 o'clock this morning re
turned the call of Rear Admiral En
quist. Upon leaving the Russian flag
ship a salute of thirteen guns was
fired.
ST. PKTERSBURG, June s.â Both the
Foreign Office and Admiralty say the de
cision whether to disarm the three Rus
sian cruisers at Manila or effect* repairs
there and endeavpr to reach a Russian
port was left with Admiral Enquist to
determine according to his best judg
ment. Little doubt was felt that the
cruisers would be interned until the end
of the war.? as before the repairs could
be effected a Japanese squadron would be
oft Correjridor Island waiting to capture
or sink them. , - - â¢ . â¢
"Japan will. I believe, be entirely
satisfied with this Government's- in- 1
structions that the Russian ships at
Manila must Intern or must put to
sea," said Minister Takahira to-night.
The Minister, upon receiving from
the State Department the official report
of the action of the President regard-
Ing the disposition of the^three Russian
ships, sent a long cablegram to Tokio
on the subjece .It is probable that a
reply . will reach Washington- pn
Wednesday, officially expressing the
satisfaction of Japan with this Govern
ment's action.
WASHINGTON, June s.â Secretary Taft
to-day cabled to Governor Wright at Ma
nila to inform Admiral Enquist /that, in
strict puisuance of .the policy adopted by
this Government, he ..\u25a0will be allowed to
Intern his ships, the Aurora, Oleg and
Jerntchug, at Manila. \u25a0 In case he does
not adopt this course his only alternative,
after the period-allowed by international
law has expired, -will be to put to sea.
It is fully expected here that Admiral
Enquist will decide to intern his ships and
orders have been issued for Admiral
Train to take charge of the details of in
ternment if the Russian Government' de
cide "to follow this policy.
Tiio President's decision regarding the
disposition of the Russian .war vessels at
Manila, that they shall intern or put to
sea, is, it is said here, in accordance with
the best naval opinion, and is in pursu
ance of the policy of strict neutrality fol
lowed by the Washington Government
from the beginning of the war.. It is spe
cifically declared that there is no -inden
tion to show the slightest favoritism, in
the matter and everything" possible will
be done for the* comfort of the wounded
Russians. The ships, when interned, will
bt; allowed to be put into habitable con
dition and such repairs as arc necessary
to keep them afloat will be permitted.

NEW YORK, June- 6.;-Hard and fast
ashore. .aboutj a mile and a half from the
Short Beach Life Saving Station neir
FiÂ«eport,V Long 'lsland, Is a'-blg steam
ship; which is believed to be orie of tne
ttans-AUsntic liners. . So high a sea. la
running that it has been impossible for
the life savers to reach her. Captain
Smith of the Short Beach station says he
believes the ship to: be in great danger.
adding that t hero is slight charxce of her
escaping without serious . damage. The
vessel is fastened high on the bar about
a â¢ half mile frcm j the spot* where a ship
In ' the . Chinese trade went^ ashore two
years ago and was pounded to pieces.
It was at high tide at about 9 o'clock
last night' that the ship went aground.
The first known of her distress was when
the -,- residents of Freeport heard her
whistle. The ship was then burning red
fire and Jrom her deck signaling with a
strong searchlight.
The life saving station at Freeport is
abandoned, there being only one man In
charge. The steamship stopped ' signaling
at about 1 :30 o'clock and began playing
two searchlights \u25a0in â¢an effort to locate
her position. â¢
â¢ â¢ Persons, living on the coast are positive
that the grounded vessel is one of the big
liners. They, base this belief on the long
line of lights showing. The incoming lin
ers scheduled to arrive to-day include the
Kaiser Wilhelm 111, the â¢ Cretlc and .the
Astoria. â¢ v\-
\u25a0 The coast lookouts of the Merrltt-Chap
man Company . reported to their office in
this city that the steamship was ashore,
but said no calls had been made for as
sistance.
.The steamship is off what is known as
Jones Beach, 'a long, low-lying sandbar
about seven or eight miles to the west
of Fire Island. >i;

Alfonso is the first King of Spain to
visit in England. The police precautions
were so strict that few persons could
get close enough to see the royal visitor.
Besides, the wet weather made it neces
sary for the two monarchs to drive to
the palace In a closed carriage, so that
only a passing glimpse was obtained of
the Spanish King's boyish face as he
leaned toward the- window to acknowl
edge the cheers of the people. He ap
peared greatly pleased with his reception,
standing in a natural manner and lifting
his cap continuously. The carriage was
driven at a lively trot, and, although a
roundabout route was followed, the drive
occupied but a short time.
Had any one desired to injure the Span
ish ruler it would have been impossible.
The route was lined with troops for show
purposes, but the soldiers were , backed
by a force of police two . deep. * Police
and plain clothes ; men were : scattered
through the crowd along the line., Close
inquiries were made at the hotels, clubs
and grandstands to prevent suspfcious
characters from . gaining access , to these
places of vantage.
Alfonso arrived in London this even
ing. He was welcomed at the railroad
station by King Edward. Their Majes
ties then drove* to - Buckingham Palace.
No untoward Incident jnarked the event.
' The inside of the palace - afforded, .a
splendid - contrast to the uncomfortable
conditions outside. r In the grand entrance
ball stood the King's gentlemen-at-arms
and the yeomen of the guards, dressed
in gold and scarlet, and at the top of
the great staircase Queen7Alexandra and
Princess Victoria were . waiting to give
their welcome to King Alfonso,- who
stopped a step just below where the
Queen was standing and kissed the tips
of her outstretched fingers. /
After a few words of greeting King
Alfonso was conducted to the state
apartments, and a little later, escorted
by cavalry, drove to Marlborough House
to pay his respects to the Princess of
Wales.
The King then made formal calls on the
Duke and Duchess of Connaught, and to
night dined quietly with King Edward
and the royal family at Buckingham Pal
ace. His call on the Duke and Duchess
of Connaught is considered significant in
view of the fact that his engagement to
their daughter,, Princess .Victoria, has
been reported.
POLICE LINE STREETS.
The train was brought to a standstill by
an obstruction on the line at Earlington,
four and a half miles from Portsmouth.
It was at first thought that this obstruc
tion had been purposely placed there, but
it developed that a piece of the roof of
the Earlington station had fallen on the
track.
GREETED BY EDWARD.
The special train with the King, .the
Prince of Wales > and . their suites left
Portsmouth for London amid the thun
ders of salutes and the cheering :of
crowds, while the band played the Span
ish national anthem.
MET BY PRINCE OF WALES.
The Prince of Wales, representing King
Edward, (awaited the yacht on the dock
with a guard of honor, and immediately
after the gangway was placed he went on
board .and welcomed the Spanish ruler.
Their representative suites were then in
troduced, and subsequently the Mayor
and corporation of Portsmouth presented
to his Majesty an address of welcome, in
responding to which the King said:
"I â¢wish to all In this great empire un
der your King's scepter every prosperity,
and as you are among the first to wel
come my arrival, I request that you alone
be the first to convey my gratitude to
those whom you represent. Assure them
that the remembrance of these happy
moments will always be cherished in my
heart." . < \u25a0
The young King, who wore the uniform
of a British general, with the ribbon of
the order of the Garter, stood on deck,
evidently keenly enjoying the spectacle in
spite of the pouring rain.
The day, which broke drearily- in
France, Increased in gloom as the British
royal yacht Victoria and Albert crossed
the channel from Cherbourg, accompa
nied by a strong escort of British cruis
ers and torpedo-boat destroyers. Ap
proaching the mouth of the harbor the
royal yacht passed through line after
line of fighting vessels bedecked with
flags and flying the Spanish ensign. A
score of the vessels fired the royal sa
lute.
LONÂ»ON, June s.â Alfonso XIII, the
young King of Spain, was welcomed to
England to-day with the most elaborate
of ceremonies, every detail of which was
supervised by King Edward himself. Nev
er in the case of a reception for a royal
visitor has greater attention been paid to
detail or more careful preparation been
made for a magnificent display. If the
weather had been propitious the recep
tion would have been the most brilliant
ever * accorded a foreign visitor to Eng
land. A deluge of rain at Portsmouth
and at London, however, marred all the
spectacular effects.

HIGHLANDS. June s.â Nick O. Huber,
for ten years a bluejacket in the United
States navy and a member of the crew
of the battleship Oregon when she made
her historic race around the Horn, but
now a patient at the State Insane Hos
pital at Patton, proved himself 6till a
hero to-day by saving an aged man from
certain death at the risk of his own life.
Huber was sent here from Los Angeles as
a Federal patient. He had been caught
rifling letters in the Los Angeles postof
fice. but proved hereditary insanity and
thereby escaped a penitentiary sentence.
About the same time Dr. W. H. Tibbetts
was also sent to the asylum from Los An
geles and the two became fast friends.
Tibbetts, while out for his morning walk
to-day, took an Insane notion that he
would walk upon the railway track. His
disordered mind told him that trains could
not injure him and therefore when the
Santa Fe flyer came dashing down the
steep grade toward Patton station the
insane doctor made no effort to get out
cf the way.
Huber was seated at a small station
nearly a hundred yards away and seeing
his friend's peril he ran up the track to
ward him and toward the approaching
train. There was no time to pull the in
sane doctor off the track, and a second's
delay would have been fatal to both.
Like a football player Huber sprang for
â¢vrard. dashing his body against that of
the doctor and I ' hurling both into the ditch
beside the track. So close was the train
that the pilot of the engine sruck Hu
ber's shoe, but he was not injured.
The incident \u25a0was witnessed by a dozen
persons, and when they approached Hu
ber and praised his act he said, simply:
"It was only my duty; no man would
have done otherwise." Â»

Invitation of the Snltan
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
PARIS. June s.â Strong tension is de
veloping in the Cabinet as the result of
the rejection by the Sultan of Morocco of
the French reform proposals. The situa
tion is similar to that when Foreign Min
ister Delcasse suddenly presented his res
ignation. He has not giv-. n any indica
tion of his purpose, but reports circulate
In well -informed quarters that he mAy
retire Vtf his Moroccan policy does not re
ceive the united support of the Ministers.
It ls expected that the Sultan's action in
proposing to refer the question to an in
ternational conference will be submitted
to the Council of -.ur.isters to-morrow.
The question of its acceptance or rejection
ls likfly to involve also the Cabinet sit
uation.
FEZ. Morocco, June 2.â No doubt is en
tertained in diplomatic circles that the
proposal of Morocco to submit the French
proposals to a conference of the powers
eigx.a.tcry of the Madrid convention will
be categorically declined by the British.
French, Spanish and Russian Govern
ments. Uncertainty prevails regarding
the attitude of the other powers. It is
thought in some quarters that Germany
may utilize the Moorish proposals as a
pretext to enter into direct negotiations
with France, In which case the Moroccan
question may possibly be settled in Paris
or Berlin.
The fact that the Moorish decision was
made known on the eve of the arrival
here of Gerald A. Lowther, the British
Minister, is commented upon and is re
parded as being a distinct mark of dis
courtesy to the British Government.
Count yon Tattenbach-Ashold, head of
the German mission, is evidently in high
favor at the palace, where he has fre
quent interviews with the Sultan.
NEW YORK PASTOR
FAVORS DIVORCES
Dr. Savage Says They Are in
Interest of Oppressed ,
AVomen.
NEW YORK, June 5. â In a sermon at
the Church of the Messiah. Rev. Minot
<_J. Savage has expressed the belief that
on the whole the lagre number of di
vorces at the present time are alto
grcther to be welcomed.
"Thej- are," he said, "nearly always
in the interest of oppressed women,
Kiving them another opportunity for
6 free, sweet, wholesome life. There
are cases where the divorce laws are
nbxised, but not nearly so numerous as
the ministers of a great many of our
churches seem to imagine.
"Law does not make marriages. The
church does not make marriages. Men
iind women, if they are ever married,
marry themselves. All the law can do
is to make a clumsy attempt to pro
tect: ail the church can do is to rec
ognize and try to consecrate a fact
which already exists. But if there is
no marriage, then It, is desecration to
keep up the sham."

J. T. Doouitle, the well-known mining
engineer, and Dr. G. E. Caglierl, and a
corps of prospectors returned yesterday
from a trip to the north arm of Death

to pan out from the rich gravel a grub

Although the returning party refuses to
Cifcuss Its recently purchased property
it has been learned that Doolittle repre

to develop the property, that has already

results. The deal was effected through
E. W. Fogg and J. F. Elliott of Orovtlle.
The values of the gravel are reported to
be very high. The property has been
known to miners for many years, but no
one saw fit to give it a thorough investi

Dig Mlnlnc ' Enterprise to Be Estab
lished In the Canyon of Historical
Western ii^ot*
With the strongest coterie of players
tnat ever accompanied a star across the
continent Mrs. Fiske presented "Leah
Kleschna" last evening at 'the Majestic
Theater and 'scored- a hit equal to that
achieved by her "Becky Sharp" several
years ago. The curtain calls that, fol
lowed each act were cumulative of hearti
ness,', and came from all parts of a house
filled to its capacity. : . .;â¢:',-\u25a0
Mrs. Fiske has so long been hailed as
the chief American apostle of the- new
school of dramatic symbolism, as created
by Suderman. Hauptmann, Ibsen and Mae
terlinck, that her departure into what
seemed Â»-c field of realistic melodrama
caused discussion and some misgiving
among her disciples in San Franciscoâ
misgiving wnich was not, lessened by the
advance assurance that the titular role
was strong in opportunity for psychologi
cal revelation, because It was noted "that
the author, of the play hau, never pro
duced anything prior to It with the ex
ception of a musical comedy thing, "The
Belle of New York." which certainly re
flected no ability on his part to fathom
and bring to. light the mysterious com
plexities of the feminine mind. Also In
trepidation It was hinted that in portray
ing a professional thief Mrs. Fiske was
stooping to pander to the herd and aban
doning the elect. Leah was -looked, upon
as a Nancy Sikes without the refining
touches of Dickens' master hand. The
stories were read and paralleled for com
parison. Nancy's repentance was brought
about through the stirring of her ma
ternal instinct by the gullelessness of lit
tle Oliver. Leah's moral uplifting was
prompted by her. sex love for a man who
regarded crime as curable by kindness.
Nancy was in heart bondage to the brutal
Mr. Bill Sikes. Leah was In filial slavery
to a more Indulgent burglar. Therefore,
argued the sorrowing upholders of the
"new thought," Mrs. Fiske is going to
give us a variationâ a modernized edition â
of Bill's victim. .
But the clever little woman disappoint
ed while she delighted her. pessimistic
clientele. True, the play was melodra
matic >oth in construction and charac
terization, and in a certain theater far
ther east on Market street It could be
made to thrill the. gallery. . In the hands
of Mrs. Fiske and her company, however,
its essential claptrap was so deftly ob-.
scured aa to appear artistic. There was
safe cracking and pistol drawing and
creepy lighting effect, but they were made
to seem absolutely h necessary to t7!e
proper development "of the "story. Aria,
aside from 'the fact that both women
were nurtured. in crime and soul racked
by remorse, there was- no similarity of
temperament between Leah Kleschna
and Nancy- Slkes. Mrs... Fiske made Leah
a positive young person, unawed by fear
of her master as poor Nancy was, and
the remarkable expression by suggestion
for which the clever -little woman ; 'is
noted was given effective display In every
scene. Her words conveyed no less rriean
ingj than their - intonation \u25a0 or the accom
panying gestures' or ' facial play. Even
when the intensity of her acting made
some of her lines inarticulate to the folk
In the back rows, they appreciated the
passion that inspired the speech. In this
connection it may not be amiss to state
that Mrs. Fiske is in much better vocal
form than she was during her previous
engagement in this city. As hereinbefore
asserted, her Leah is the most enthrall
ing bit of work she. has done here since
her Becky established her favoritism.
Of the company it may also be repeated
that a stronger one throughout has never
aided any star on this side of the conti
nent. John Mason's splendid declamatory
forte finds ample swing in the part of
the preachy gentleman whose charitable
views on criminology, aided by an at
tractive personality, reform Leah's views
on her own duty to society. Charles
Cartwiight, an English actor, makes
Kleschna a character of memorable dis
tinctness 60 far Is ft removed from the
conventional cracksman while retaining
all the love of his art that possesses the
thorough criminal. William B. Mack's
work as a burglar of uncertain mental
attitude was excellent, and George Ar
liss mercilessly portrayed the unlovely .
traits of a young Parisian degenerate.
Edward Donnelly was a heavy father
quite akin to the every-day stagÂ© papa.
The supporting women did nothing
worthy of special mention.
In the elaborate and artistio stage pic
tures Mrs. Flske's managerial hand was
clearly reflectedâ as Indeed It was in every
detail of the production.
The Central.
Tragedy, comedy and an array, of
scenic pictures, tog-ether . with an even
ly balanced company, rounded out an
excellent production of "The Eleventh
Hour" last night at the Central The
ater. The play is the beginning of: the
Lincoln J. Carter .series of melo
dramas. All of the Carter plays will
be produced under the personal man
agement of Charles A. Sellon. In .the
leading role of the play. Mr. Gamble
does a fine bit of acting. He plays a
dual role and .though the second part
which he portrays is that of a criminal
he elicits much praise by his Cleveland
sincere work. .
Miss Hopkins was perfectly at. home
in her role and she gave more than
her: most sanguine friends . couldi ex
pect." Miss Hopkins,: has youth and
beauty and a fine, figure and Is an ex
cellent actress.. Another favorite .who
was " heartily applauded was - Ernest

There is very little doubt now that. this

called an election to decide whether bonds
will be issued for the purpose, and as

seems â¢ unlikely that an adverse vote will
be cast. SchooL Trustee' Robert Brltton
and j the attorney of the board have de
cided to call for 'an issue of $20,000 In
bonds to mature in twenty years, g
The election will- be held to-morrow
under the , direction "of the following of
ficers: Inspector J. L. Woods, Judges D.
O. Daggett and VT. S: Taylor. The voters
of the San Bruno School District will

whether or not South San Francisco Is

peculiarities of centipedes, decided that
the odd-looking Insect which was .found
in Quantities â¢ on the stalks \u25a0of the * as
paragus, was a species of centipede. ;
"Now centipedes' bile people and : they
bite animals, or they bite insects. They
live on flesh and not on vegetable life, so
far as science Knows, and in all the lit
erature on the subject they are classined
as carnivorous insects. â¢'
It- has not been known hitherto that
centipedes preyed upon vegetable life. In
ail the literature dealing with the sub
ject, Professor Woodworth says, the cen
tipede family is rated as carnivorous.
The tact that a. branch of the family,
centipedes unquestionably, has attacked
the asparagus beds in -the Sacramento
Valley, devastating the fields and strik
ing despair to the hearts of the growers.
Is, according to Professor Woodworth, a
distinctly new cont t ibuvion to the history
of the centipede tribe. - .\u25a0

i The . object of the cooking experiments , Is fo
ptudy the changes and losses resulting ' from
the different methods of cooking and the'ef
fect* of cooking upon digestibility^ and â¢ nutria
j.lve value." During, thft past year these experi
pients have 'been' made- -oniy with- meat.-ind
principally' with beef. ". \u25a0 ' â¢â¢Â«-- .- ;â¢-.\u25a0\u25a0.
< The purpose. of-. the dietary studies is to se
cure information regarding the kinds, amounts
and cost of food materials used by- people un
der wids?ly varying conditions . in different parts
pf the country,: f to furnish data for comparison
with tne reeultn of similar investigations In
this and other countries, ana to assist In es
tablishing general dietary standards.
Tht digestion experiments have for their pur
pose the securing of data regarding the digesti
bility-of different- classes or food materlaleâ
I. e., 'the amount of consumed ' material, which
Is actually made use of by the body and the
'establishment of standard ractors or . coeffl
clents cf digestibility. The special classes of
food materials studied during the past year
were legumes, cereals, fruits and" nuts. The
digestion experiments : with cereal* \u25a0 were { made
with various cereal foods and \u25a0 with macaroni
and bread from 1 , flour rallied \u25a0: from 'American,
grown macaroni wheat. . . \u25a0'- \u25a0
i The investigations with the respiration calo
rimeter have included experiments with men in
which the income and outgo of nitrogen, carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen and energ-y were determined.
(An Important feature of some of the experi
ments during the year' was the etudy of the
relative value of fats and carbohydrates as
sources of energy < for ; muscular work.
1 In the , prosecution of the Inquiry during the
past year attention has been devoted more par
ticularly; to cotJklng- experiments, dietary stud
leu, digestion \u25a0 experiments, and investigations
with the. respiration . calorimeter^ on the trans
formations of matter and energy In the human
body.;, \u25a0 \u0084 ,/ ,\u25a0,:.\u25a0 v. / " -\u25a0' ; " : " !
, In these Investigations attention Is devoted
mainly to the physiology, hygiene and econom
ies of nutrition. \u25a0â¢ Chemical, work is confined as
closely as pcssible to that necesssitrily involved
Jn the different inquiries. The chief object of
the inquiry is to discover the fundamental laws
ot nutrition and their economic -and' eoclologi
cal application to the health and well being of
mankind. - . . .
! Fruit" and nuts may be made a very useful
part. of the diet, but aside from the work al
ready undertaken by Professor Jaffa compara
tively little attention has been given to the
study of their nutritive value by Investigators.
California furnishes such an abundant variety
of both fruit and nuts that the conditions for
such Investigations are very favorable and ltU
hopedârtnat ' this Inquiry .will establish ."the
dietetic value of these food materials and lead
to their more general and \u25a0 intelligent use In
American households, i
! Dr. Evans has been at the college of
agriculture for three days in close con
ference with Professor Jaffa regarding
the work _which the latter has /done
here. California fruits have, been the
chief staple used by Jaffa in his work,
grains and -nuts forming an incidental
feature of. the. menu:which his. subjects
have eaten, while under his care.
. Matter of rare interest to scientists
and to the/plain people as well Is to
be \u0084revealed- ..when Proffessor Jaffa
prints his second bulletin, the data for
which 'has just been under examination
by Dr.' Evans. According to Dr. Evans,
Professor Jaffa nas'had unusual facili
ties for carrying out investigations of
this nature and was able to obtain es
pecially good subjects for â¢ the experi
ments. Dr. Evans says: . * â¢
BERKELEY, June s.â Prof essor M.
E. Jaffa submitted to Dr. Walter H. :
Evans to-day hisdata regarding exper
iments he has made to determine the
values o^ California food products, all
of will be". made : the .subject of
an important bulletin to be Issued at
pnee by the Government at- Washing
ton. So highly thought of is Professor
Jaffa's work at the university by; the
Government officials, of whom Dr. Ev
ans is one, that his name appears at
the head of the list of those who* are
in charge ot experiment stations, Dr.
Evans, himself an expert, saying to^
day: "Professor Jaffa knows ten times
as much aboutthe science of: experi
menting to detecmine the nutritive val
ues of food as I do."

Special Dispatch to The - Call.
Gargurevich reported the discovery of
the grave to the ccroner. As it was after
dark when the report was received, the
authorities decided to wait until morning
before visiting the scene of the discovery.
Gargurevich said to-night that there is
no doubt that the grave contains some
kind of a body, and from its shape he
believes that it Is that of a human being.
As the animal refused to enter the
brush. GargurevJch pushed aside the
tangle of boughs and there found the
frrave concealed under a mass of freshly
cut branches of bay". He pulled the
branches aside, and found that the grave,
which measured about five feet by two
f eÂ«t, had not been entirely filled, and
under the shallow covering of earth he
could discern. the body.- - .- \u25a0
OAKLAND, June B.â Carefully covered
with freshly cut branches, a newly dug
grave, large enough to contain easily the
body of a human being, was found this
afternoon In a secluded epot In the Berke
ley hills by A- W. Gargurevich, a soap
makgr, residing at IUI Powell street/San
Francisco. Gargurevich, who is employed
at ihe Pacific Coast Company's works,
had come across the bay -on a hunting
trip, and walked up the road from Berry
man Station to a point just back of the
filtering plant of the Contra Costa Water
Company,' where he was exploring the
hills in search of small game.
While making his way up a narrow
ravine, heavily clothed with brush, the
young man's attention was drawn to a
clump of bushes by the peculiar actions
of his dog, which was running around the
thicket sniffing at something concealed
from view, and whining in a strange
manner. â¢ â¢ - . \u25a0 \u25a0.

As soon |as the vote was announced on

An ordinance was passed to: print to raise

H. O'Brien from $125 to $150. a" month..
"I warn you that a ruling -of that kind
1p subversive of all principles of legisla
tion and democracy." "As the fight waxed
hotter ' Elliott talked of "conspirators,"
to ; which^term Councilmen Burns i and
Baccus â¢objected, while President ' Fit
zgerald ordered the speaker to his seat.
Elliott continued his denunciation of the
president's' ruling and of the action as
attempted. He appealed, as did Council-*
man " Meese, from i the chair's - decision
calling for the roll call on the resolutions.'
The president was sustained by the fol

When the fire, alarm tapper rang in yester
day morning from bex 05, announcing a fire In
the vicinity cf Taylor and Golden, Gate ave
nue, the man that pulls the whistle cord at
the Western Fuel Company got/ the numbers
twisted in hii mind while-walking from where
he heard the signal to where the key card
hangs. It was CÂ» when be . got there and 59
on the card said First and Brannan Btrests. The
Western Fuel Company's whistle repeats the
R'.artn in all cases where the water front is
Involved and es tbÂ« Pacific Mail wharves are
nt First and Brannan there was a stampede
or policemen in that direction whfin the whis
tle eounded "59," > When they couldn't find any
'fire there the bluecoats so reported to the
Harbor poHce station and then learned that the
Western Fnel whlrtle man had Juggled the fig

Got the Numbers Twisted.
The steamer Francis H. Leggett arrived
yesterday from the Columbia River with an
other big log raft In tow. The raft reached
port intact and mariners cf the coasting trade
will breathe easier until the next r&ft gets
under way. The raft which arrived yesterday
is ma.de up of heavy logs, any one of. which,
adrift in a heavy sea, could deal a death blow
to the stoutest vessel afloat. TheÂ«e rafts have
long beÂ«n regarded as a serious menace to
navlgaxion and lt -is likely that before long
the acltation against this method of shipping
lumber will bear fruit in the passing- of a
Federal law forbidding the practice. The
Francis H. Leggett will in a few days leave
for Eureka, with the British chip Battle Abbey
In tow. The Battle Abbey will take 700 ton*
of coal to Eureka, probably the first cargo of
black diamonds ever carried Into the Humbofdt
port, from which much coal is shipped. The
Battle Abbey's coal is w<,rth more here than
it will be In Eureka, but she has to have bal
last and It was decided that the eaving-of the
expense cf discharging the coal and taking on
other ballast would more than offset the dif
ference In the selling value of the coal. At
Eureka the Battle Abbey will load lumber for
Australia.
Lost Raft Cornea to Port.
The water front fresh air brigade is out
with an ax for Hatch Bros. The water front
from the ferry to Folsora street is a favorite
cummer promenade on Sundays and during
the luncheon hours of week days. In bright
weather the bulkheads are crowded. In taking
their daily constitutional the pedeetritLns from
the downtown offices and stores walk, from
necessity, along the bulkheads, as the only
sidewalk that East street boasts consists prin
cipally of loose planks, which on small provo
cation rise up and abrase the Khins of the
passerby and in falling back into place spat
ter him or her with a mud peculiar for Its ad
hesive qualities and fast color. On the street,
ewift and often client, electric cars make for
the discomfort of a post or ante prandial
saunter. For the protection of pedestrians the
Harbor Commissioners some time ago set a
row of posts across the bulkhead at the foot
of Mission street and at intervals farther
south, so that teams could not make an along
the-water-front driveway of the bulkhead. The
roadway Is narrow where the Mission-street
posts sre located, the Harbor Hospital taking
up most of the bulkhead. Right in the center
of these narrows Hatch Bros., who operate a
line of steamers to Vallejo, have lashed a
huge transparency on which is printed an ad
vertisement of their line. This reduces the
narrow width cf the sidewalk by half and
completely obstructs the view along this part
of the water front. Complaints have been
made to the Harbor Commissioners and before
next Sunday the roadway will probably be
cleared of the obstruction.

The Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
liner China, Captain Friele. arrived yes
terday from the Far East cro\yded with
passengers and bringing a moderate
*ized but Quite valuable cargo. The
China, for long the flagship of the
company's fleet, though no longer the
largest, is still the handsomest vessel
flying the Pacific Mail flag. She was
designed on a liberal plan. Her high
decks and roomy passenger quarters.,
mean comfort for the traveler, and with
those whose business takes them fre
quently to and from the Far East the
China is still first favorite. During the
absence of Captain Seabury of the
Korea, who is taking an extended va
cation. Captain Friele is the commo
dore captain on the trans-Pacinc run
and under his command the China still
runs true to her schedule.
The China on her homeward voyage
saw nothing of the Russian fleet, al
though shortly after leaving Hongkong
there was seen on the horizon a heavy
smoke which Captain Friele believes
came from the funnels of the Czar's
thips. News of the Japanese naval
victory was received on board the
China at Honolulu and furnished food
for conversation for the remainder of
the voyage.
The China brought about 2100 tons of
fargo, which included a large shipment
of hemp and 1630 bales of raw silk.
She brought in the cabin about 150
passengers and from Honolulu 197
Japanese.

HONOLULU, June s.â The Governor of

the militia -of the Territory to prevent or
suppress . lawlessness." violence,. Invasion,
insurrection or rebellion In said Territory,
and ho may incase of rebellion* or Inva
sion, or imminent, danger thereof, when
the public safety requires It, suspend the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or
place the Territory, or any "part thereof,
under martial law -until communication
can be had with the President or his de
cision thereon be made known."
'The killing of the militia appropriation
bill in the Hawaiian -Legislature led to
the discovery of the foregoing facts. The
discussion which has been, aroused over
the demise of politics in uniform has
brought to both the Governor and the
military authorities here some knowledge
that neither previously possessed. And
yet the power that lt was intended by
Congress should be given to the Governor
of Hawaiiâ power transcending that of
any Governor of any State in the Union,
and in some respects equaling that of the
President himselfâ has - merely been in
abeyance. . \u25a0
-"I did not know before that the Gov
ernor had any such power," said Colonel
McClellan, commanding the United State 3
army forces in Hawaii. "I shall take
pains to see Governor Carter at once and
acquaint him with the facts f that have
been brought to my knowledge."

"The Bearing of Luther Burbank's Ex
periments on : the ; Doctrine of Election"
was ; the : subject of- an address byj E.i A.
Sturge, / M.VjD., before the Presbyterian
MinistersVUnion at the home of the" Occi
dental .board; 920; Sacramento street,: yes-^
terday. Dr.* Sturge -said. In part:
'\u25a0\u25a0 "We are : all plants cf .Gcd's . garden. ThÂ«
father Is the husbandman. \ riis desire is that
we should: bear more: and fruit and get
rid' of our thorny nature, which is due' to sin.
' As Mr. Burbank goes through his fields, se
lecting j those trees: or plants which give signs
of promise and consigning the rest to.destruc
tion, v so God ; has from tne beginning chosen
certain nations, and individuals for a ' special
purpose. - . r â¢ - .- -. â¢ . . . s
. â¢ Why have some peoples utterly perished?
Why ; a re -^ the American Indians and ' native
Australians almost extinct r Why are some
nations more â¢ blewjed " of heaven "than 'others?
: The answer ls:'*"Kvery tr^3 that brlngeth not
forth good fruit is hewn down."
.-..There are many'people whodo not like the
I doctrine of election, though it is so clearly
stated in the Bible: -
It seems unjust, to â¢ then:, that God;should
choose one. nation and destroy another.
Would we not regard him as a foolish farmer
who neglected to select the best seed from
which -to raise future cropa? '
If God neglected tc. exercise a wise choice
amonqr Individuals and nations, would he. not
be acting more foolishly than men?
". Of -course God elects. . Tnere is no, other, way
cf evolving a superior race. <^
HIS KNOWLEDGE TESTED.
-â¢\u25a0 Mr. Burbank <iulckly runs his eye over thou
sands of plants and selects ; those best fitted
for his purpose. Just as we are able to pick
out -good poople at a glance, so he can at once
choose the best, and these he predestinates to
be conformed into something he has In - view.
His knowledge has been put to the test.
So the all wise Gcd. foreknowing \u25a0 men far
better, than Mr. Burbank can know his plants,
predestinates them to be conformed to the
image of his son.
If in '; the future . any one tolls us that he
does .not believo In the doctrine of election as
Â«.et forth in the Bible, let us refer him to such
\u2666â¢xperiments as- those carried pn- by Luther
Burbank, in order that he may be convinced,
and have his feet firmly planted upon the Im
pregnable rock of Hcly Scripture. .
"The Bible is inspired^either this," or it
Is a fraud," said the Rev. H. H. . Bell. D.
D., pastor of the First United Presbyte
rian Church, in the course , of an address
on "The Holy Spirit" at a meeting of the
Methodist' preachers held yesterday at the
Central Methodist Episcopal Church, Mis
sion street. Dr. Bell continued: .
Either it is God-given or from Genesis to
Revelations it is a He. But lt is God-given.
It Is sprit breathed. All Its writers were pre
sided over directfed and used by the Holy
Spirit. - Its very words are God-breathed.
Tho inspired word of God is profitable for
doctrine, lor ' roprnof, for correction, for ln
pirucllon In rl*htecusncfs. , .
GOD-BREATHED WORK.
The God-breathed work of the Holy Spirit in
Scripture is for a purpose. \u25a0 it is to reveal God
to willing mortals. In this respect Scriptural
inspiration infinitely differs rrom all other so
calleil inspiration.
* Lteratoro, however lofty in sentiment, how
ever Icgical in - trend, i however : descriptive of
character, however indicative of: culture, never
can be revelation. Hence Shakespeare, Milton.
Itac-Hi ami euch like were in no like sense in
spired as were ! the ' more than forty writers
of the Bible.' '
The : reason why st> many cf us are . so little
self-dtsclose-1 and. have so little real soul de
velopment 'its we are. too self-sufflclent, too lit
tle sell-surrendered.:-- â¢ -
You may have a great head,. but without: a
great heart lt will be a great humbug in soul
winning work. 'Spare no palng in cultivatlns
your brains, but you will be 111 at ease until
you have also and equally cultivated your
hoart. - â¢ * ,

Then there is the j ideal which charmed Frederic' Lingini Into esthetic
and amorous raptures ;in the . fifteenth century, extolling , mere , physical
perfection which* sought consciously to charm, to attract, to allure -men
into love. It was : the beauty of a siren, .who' yet was a slave. And finally
we'have in our own day. a ; standard which; so Â« far asr vigor and: physical
perfection and unconsciousness-' ls concerned is like to that of the song of
Solomon, but which has new power of strength and j capability, but also too
much delicacy to be masculine. ;/; j
VrV This last conception of feminine lieauty is .our .American ideal, it
seems to me, when we view .it. from the standpoint ,'of love; .whereas
the sixteenth century: ideal still- obtains in France. Here.though a womaji:
be a siren,: nevertheless she Is a clave. ;,
Paris, May 14.
ONE cannot live long in Franee\wlthout new appreciation of Edmund
Burkes definition of love as a passion caused by Â» beauty, a -personal
quality which acts- mechanically upon" the human mind by the inter
vention of the senses. For in, France love has neither the high intellectual
nor the spiritual quality which 0 mmmM
characterizes its finer, types in our
own land. It is "the grand pas
sion," an emotional spree as heady
as champagne.
Our American ideal, and the
place in the social scheme which
our men aqcord to woman, is abso
lutely incomprehensible to French
thought. In a land run wholly in
the interests of man, woman is
either a helpmate or a plaything.
Socially she may be a force. But
she is not to be trusted out of
sight. She must be watched and
she must be guarded/ Her great
triumph in life â¢is to awaken ad
miration and love, not such a love
as we believe in at home,. the dedi
cation of one's whole life to a
single supreme Joy, one noble in-^
Fpiration, but; a love which "is^a
selfish delight, an exhilarating
pleasure. .
. Mere beauty of form and feature
has therefore a value to a French
woman which it would never have
to an' American. For by beauty
may she win her queendom or lose
it If she is ugly she must make
herself interesting, if -only super
ficially. If she is fair, her charms
are never so great that they can-,
not be enhanced artificially.â
Does fashion call.' for a com
plexion of pink pallor? Then nine
Parisians out of ten will put on
pink pallor. To French Ideas a
nose - shaped into good outline . by
paraffin is a feature far \ more
worthy than it would be if left in
Its natural uncomely, state, Its lean
places unpadded. -..

of French femininity, and endeav- 5. ...Â»-Â». s . ; , -. . : , .â'.â¢,,;.- <-:t.iÂ«i#
oring to compare it with our womanly standards, I am reminded of. Man
tegazza's classification of beauty.; There are,, the Italian /psychologist : de
clares, three distinct beauty eras in the world's history.-: First we iind the
ideal of beauty extolled in Salomon's "Song; of Songs":* Stature Mks^tho

t : Mention was 1 made In these coluhjns
some time : ago, says the Philadelphia
Record, that the experiment of using
glass for street \u25a0_â¢ pavement had been
found to be. very successful in that it
was very durable; but that the first
cost of the material made the scheme
almost prohibitive. ; Now v comes -the
word that the cost has been' reduced by
the discovery of M. Garchy, a well
known French scientist, : who has de
vised a process of melting all kinds of
old glass and transforming it into ma-,
terial as hard and serviceable as Bel
gian blocks.
Although the process has just been
announced to the public, it was dis
covered many 'years ago and has been
in the course of perfection. In 1898
he * pbtained permission from the mu
nicipal authorities of Lyons to pave a
portion of one of their main streets
with this new material and thus prove
to the.world the value of his discovery.
The street selected was a principal
thoroughfare/which was under con
tinuous and heavy trafllc. and yet the
glass is ; still as sound as when first
put* down. . ..Â»;\u25a0 " .- '\u25a0}\u25a0:â¢'?â¢#;"\u25a0'.'.
jM. Garchy claims for, "ceramo-crys
tal," as he calls It, that, lt can be manu
factured at' a "much % more ",] reasonable
figure than any : other reliable build
ing 1 material now ; on ; the market in
Europe orAmerica, and. that it is prac
tically indestructible. It, is also highly,
attractive and artistio" in appearance,
and M.T Garchy fully expects to see it
taking the place of the building ma
terials now In use.

He had found cod liver oil amazingly
successful in promoting the growth of
teeth in children, and he recommended
the toothbrush drill as part of the curri
culum of schools. Dr. Thompson also
urged the practice of washing the teeth
after meals, and rubbing them twice a
day, and particularly the last thing at
night.
"I see no evidence to show that our
teeth are deteriorating to an alarming ex
tent with the growth of civilization," he
declared, and he. pointed out that an even
larger proportion of diseased teeth had
been found among Egyptian and Roman
remains than existed at present.
"Tobacco has an injurious effect on the
digestion," he went on, "but I do not
think that nicotine has any more effect on
the teeth than alcohol. But tobacco cer
tainly blackens the teeth, and so causes
many persons who are careful of their
personal appearance to brush their teeth
more often than they would otherwise
do."
Appendicitis Is often due to bad teeth,
said Dr. E. S. Thompson, lecturing at
Greshan College, London. The same or
ganisms, he said, were present both in
defective teeth and in the diseased ap
pendix, which proved that dental decay
was capable of causing appendicitis.

*"!""Â» HE death of Mr. Hope is announced. He had^ attained the"
I .ripe age of 69. His entire active life was occupied in robbing
banks. He took nearly $3,000,000 at one time from a bank
in New York City. He relied upon getting into the strong box and
Cc-^-cr figured as a forger. After preying for many years upon East
ern banks his spirit of enterprise caused him to : come West; and
In this city he planned the robbery, of the. old Sather bank. He
was caught in the attempt and rendered the State some service.
At the expiration of his term he did a little time in New York and
then retired to private life, living at ease in Brooklyn on his pro
fessional savings and devoting himself to music.
His wife says that he died of grief because his record as va
bank robberwas so frequently referred to. We regret this illogical
. thinness of Mr. Hope's skin. When a young man, and under no
pressure of necessity, he selected his callings as a (burglar, turning
finally to that profitable specialty of his profession, the robbing of
banks. In a. way he did some good, for his exploits caused the in
vention of the time lock and other safety devices; for bank, vaults,
the manufacture of which now adds to the honest gains of Ameri
can Â«nechanics. Hope was a rascal of great: eminence, arid retired
from his thieving activities only when age and the better protection
of bank money compelled him to quit. He made his: record and had
no right to complain because,^others remembered it;- "â¢'-â¢He should

THE TRIALS OF MR. HOPE. '
THE destruction of the Russian fleet was the conquest of all
Russian territory in Eastern Asia. The island of Saghalien
originally belonged to Japan and was taken from her in the
time of her primitive weakness by Russian craft and force. Vlad
ivostok will share the fate of Port Arthur and Japan can annex the
Copper Islands in Bering Sea, and become our neighbor and part
ner in the sealing industry. Saghalien is a large island, separated
from Siberia by the Gulf of Tartary. The latitude of London cuts it
in the middle. There is no information extant as to its value in
agriculture, but it is of importance to Japan for its command of
the fisheries of the Sea of Okhotsk.
With that in her possession the island empire of Japan will
stretch from Formosa under the tropic of Cancer to nearly 6o north
latitude and will inclose the Yellow Sea, the Sea of Japan and, by
the Kurile archipelago, the Sea of Okhotsk. The defense of such
an empire will require the maintenance of a strong navy, and the
]>erpetuation of the genius and spirit of Togo, Kamimura and Ka
taoka by their juniors.
The Japanese are following closely in the footsteps of the peo
ple of the British isles. They are sailors and have the* sea-going
character and spirit. The alliance between Great Britain and Japan
is perfectly natural. It joins two peoples whose national strength
is in their navies because they must defend their, islands. \u25a0'= No mat
ter what Japan may occupy in Korea on the. mainland, the seat of
her empire will be insular, , and her people will be sailors and sea
fighters, not inferior to any on the planet.
As our neighbor in the western half of Bering Sea, if she
choose to take what she may in that quarter, there is every reason
to believe that she will second our efforts to preserve the seal herds
and protect the marine life in those waters.
OUR NEW NEIGHBOR.
It is well for the morals of the Western nations that they must
henceforth deal with Eastern Asia as they deal with each other.
Between them there has grown up a rule of action, the common
â¢law of nations, an international code by which each is restrained
and all are bound. The battalions of Oyama and the squadrons of
Togo have proclaimed the law of nations in the East, and have put
China, Korea and Japan under its statutes. The Anglo-Saxon has
been a law-building race. Instead of molting a single feather of
its pride, it should rejoice that an Asiatic people have adopted its
canons, and imitated its best instead of its worst. The conflict on
the plains of Manchuria and at the gate of the Sea of Japan is^'a
struggle between modern civilization represented by Japan and
medieval ideas, social and civic, represented by Russia. . Let civil
ization rejoice that it is proved better than the cruelty and supersti
tion of the Middle Ages. â¢
Africa has undergone the same process, and Boer and Briton
have added to human woe and sorrow in' a struggle which was in
many respects the most pitiful in history. Germany, France, Bel
gium and Great Britain may come to blows any time over the par
tition of Africa, and the sum total of human sorrow may be in
creased because the world's equilibrium is disturbed on that conti
nent Asia has long been regarded as the prey of the European
races. China had her day as a colonizing and conquering nation,
when the ancestors of the present races of Europe were living in
holes in the ground or in huts that stood on stilts over lakes and
ponds. But China, after going far afield for conquest and dominion,
sickened of war, degraded the calling of. the soldier to the lowest
place in her economy, resorted to philosophy and learning and shut
out the world that had been overrun by her armies. 'She lost the
defensive arts when she ceased to be offensive. Then the world
penetrated her seclusion, and for Inearly a century there has been a
Just for carving up her territory and destroying her sovereignty.
Lead us not into temptation is the invocation of Christendom,
but Christendom has been tempted and has yielded. So for many
years the peace of the world has been in peril from the destruction
of equilibrium in Eastern Asia. The real interests of the Anglo-
Saxon race and of white Europe have required the rise of an Asiatic
power strong enough to compel justice to Asia. When a warship
could send a crew ashore to raise a flag, steal a province and sanc
tify the theft by planting a missionary station with a fort on one
side and a godown full of good rum on the other, it meant that
the strong were oppressing the weak, and that, in the end, is bad
for the strong. Now Japan has risen to first rank. She has wiped
out a navy" as if it had been only a chalk picture on a blackboard,
over which she passed a sponge. She has restored the equilibrium
of the world. Asia is to be treated like the Vest of God's world. The
right of the nations of Eastern Asia to say upon what terms aliens
shall come and stay and go, just as the white nations say, in safe
guarding themselves, must be respected. The status quo is in no
danger of disturbance. What has been stolen along the coast of
China may rest in the title given by possession, but an- old theft,
will no more be pleaded as a valid reason for a new one. Japan has
taken on our civilization of steam and steel, voluntarily, and ar
mored in it has turned it into a means of justice and not of oppres
sion. t
SOME woeful prophets are in trouble about the Anglo-Saxon
race, because Japan has fought her way to a footing among
the great nations. These Jeremiahs treat Russia as tlie rep
resentative white nation, and bur sides are expected to ache every
time she gets a rib cracked. Civilization is not a matter of color,
but of spirit. Modern civilization is a cult; not a complexion.
Not long ago an enthusiastic young gentleman delivered an
address in one of our Eastern cities., in which he said that it was
manifest destiny that the white race was to use the blood of all the
dark races to cement its civilization of steam and steel. That was
truly a dark outlook for the dark races, for it meant their destruc
tion in order to get material to cement a civilization alien to them.
But the young man was not blameworthy for taking his inspiration
from the past treatment of most of the dark races. America was
cut up and carved and parceled out. When the native races had
been reduced below the power of resistance, then the nations that
had used their blood for cementing purposes fell upon each other,
and we had the war of 1762 in which France and Great Britain
fought over their spoils.

the defendant, "I would send you to the
penitentiary for life and regret that I
could not order your removal from earth
immediately. The testimony of this child
proves you to be a human brute of the

John Gordon, alias Michael Hickey,
accused of vagTancy by Detective Tay

was his left leg that appeared to be
crippled. His right hand, which he held
as if it were palsied, was straightened

Judge and alluding to her husband's con

"Maybe he was jealous," the Judge ven

Mr. Riley's manner in court contributed
to impress all observers with belief that
his wife's accusation of general worth
lessness was well founded..
both Dollie and George, were indicative
of marital dereliction by the last named.
He abandoned the woman about a year
ago. leaving her penniless, and a young
man named George Schraeder, work
ing in a grocery, contributed from
his scant earnings to her support until
she obtained employment as a hairdress
er. She instituted proceedings for divorce,
and when her husband returned to town
he was shocked to hear that she and the
grocery clerk were excellent friends. So
after meeting them together on the street
he went to 213 Natoma street, where they
cccupied separate apartments, and beat
both of them.

which they will work.
The Boxinakers' and Sawyers' Union
elected the following delegates to the
anti-Japanese and Korean League at its
meeting last night: William Macintosh,
Jaroes Malmburg and J. Ennis.
In Santa Clara County a separate
league, with headquarters at San Jose,
has been formed to act in conjunction
with the league of San rVandsco. Many
employers of labor, both In this and In
other cities of the State, sent in word that
whenever it could be safely done they
would weed out as many of their Jap
anese employes as possible.
The anti-Japanese movement has not
been confined to the Pacific Coast States.
In far away Kansas City, Mo., the brown
men threaten to take the place of the
white labor in the immense packing
plants there. The American employes of
that city have formed a league of their,
own and they write that they are ready
to lend moral and financial aid to the
Callfornians at any time that they are
called uoon. : : '..
At the meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Japanese and Korean
league held at the Mission-street head
quarters of the labor unions last night,
reports were read from many interior
cities of California which showed that
the anti-Japanese sentiment and organi
zation was spreading rapidly over all the
State. In all these letters hopes were
expressed that the San Francisco league
would prove entirely successful In its ef
forts to remove the danger of the influx
of the little brown men. Many of the
communications conveyed offers of Im
mediate financial assistance.
"The Angel Island site for the new sta
tion was recommended by, the Federal au
thorities,", said the Commissioner last
night, "and from what I can learn it is a
most suitable one for the purpose. It is
my intention to visltV Angel \u25a0 Island j to
morrow and J look over the . gtound , - and
when I return from : Honolulu I will take
the matter up and ! give It the considera
tion it deserves. Of -the $200,000 appropri
ated by Congress for ithe station, $100,000
is already available, and it 'is my wish
that the station should be built as early
as possible."
The Commissioner, in speaking of the
increased Immigration from the European
countries, said that j at the present rate
of arrivals the influx of foreigners for
the present fiscal year will probably reach
the million mark. He admitted that there
was a strong feeling growing in the East
ern States against the present growth of
immigration, and he expressed. the belief
that the next Congress will I adopt some
drastic measure to remedy what many
regard as a great evil to this country.
"The public opinion in the East," . he
said, "is somewhat divided as .to the
proper method to pursue to stop the in
coming \u25a0of foreigners. Some people favor,
a modification of the laws, so that the
lower classefe from foreign countries may
be barred. Others want the gates closed
tight, while others favor some means of
distributing the Immigrants throughout
the country, in order to relieve the con
gestion of the larger cities. Several ot
the Embassadors at Washington, partic
ularly the Embassador of Italy, have al
ready given the latter scheme consider
able attention, and have, been traveling
through the South and Southwest, \u25a0 with a
view of gaining information upon the. op
portunities for immigrants in that section'
of the country. I expect- that Congress
will have several measures ; before It at

GRAPE-yUTS.
A SURPniSE PARTT.
Ilotr the Author*-** Tamed the Table*
on Her Friend*. â¢
A distinguished authoress with her
husband moved to a California fruit
ranch to get free from stomach and ner-
vous troubles. She tells her food story
as follows:
"The change to outdoor life, abund-
ance of fresh fruit, etc, did help us
fome, but as the necessity of cutting
out all indigestible foods and thus
striking at the root of the trouble had
not sufficiently impressed itself on our
minds, we continued to indulge our ap-
petites, till at last I was prostrated for
a long time with a serious illness, dur-
ing which I was simply starved on
'gruel and thing's.* One day while In
this condition I demanded Grape-Nuts,
merely because I wanted something I
could chew. My wish "was complied
with, under protest at first, however,
and then as no bad results followed, the
crisp, nutty grains were allowed me In
thp way of humoring a harmless whim.
"To the surprise of everyone, the
stomach which had persistently refused
to retain the sloppy messes usually- fed
to sick folks, readily the
Grape-Nuts, and I was soon able to take
two spoonfuls three times a day, and
when I got to that point my health and
strength came back to me rapidly. On
recovery, and taking up my work again,
I adhered to Grape-Xuts food for break-
fast and supper, eating a good, plain
dinner at noon. In four weeks I gained
10 pounds in weight. I have constantly
used Grape-Nuts food ever since and
greatly to my advantage. . .
"My faith in Grape-Nuts was a mat-
ter of much jesting to my family, and
once when my birthday came around, I
was told that a special dinner would- be
prepared to honor- the anniversary.
When I entered the dining-room I was \
surprised to find- it decorated with
Grape-Nut boxes, somÂ« empty, some
full, and some filled with flowers, etc,
etc, and the Joke was ! . hilariously 'eni!
joyed. My time came, however, when I'
returned the surprise :by producing; a
delicious Grape-Nuts pudding, and dates
stuffed with rolled * Grape-Nuts' and i
cream. Then 'those who came to scoff i
remained to gorge themselVes/'ir I may
be pardoned the expression. It has not
been difficult since that day to win con-,
verts to Grape-Nuts." Name given by
Poftum Company, Battle Creek, Mich.
Ten days' trial is proof.

A portion of the Congressional Com

rived here yesterday from the north
and is making its headquarters at the
St Francis hotel. ' The entire party,
headed by Vice President Fairbanks,
divided Itself at Portland and v por
tion of it, including Speaker: Cannon,
proceeded northward on a - visit to
Alaska, and the remainder of the body
came south for the purpose of viewing
the Yosemite Valley and other inter

In the party that arrived here yester

Shortly after the arrival of the Sen

guests of the Federal. officials on a trip
to Mount Tamalpais and last night a
number of the visitors a\'alled themselves
of an opportunity of visiting China
town. This morning the .party will

This disastrous visitation caused a sus
pension of publication for a few days.
The colonel did not surrender, however.
and before a week had passed the Novoi
Kray was doing business in a bomb-proof
cellar and with their morning rolls and
horse steaks the residents of Port Arthur
were again able to read such of the news
as the military censor would allow Arte
mieff to publish. '
Artemieff was heartbroken over the
fate of the Russian fleet. He heard the
news at Honolulu. He still has faith
in Russia's ability to win out. The loss
cf the fleet, he says, will delay matters,
but at the end Russia will be the victor.
He is going back to St. Petersburg, where
he hopes to start a newspaper which will
he devoted to the solution of Russia's
problem in the Par East. "It Is now the
whJte against the brown, and sooner or
later," said Artemieil a* he turned away.
"every white ration on earth must stand
Fide by Eide with Russia in this war of
the races. It's ug or them."
A number of army officers from Manila
and some navy officers from the Asiatic
etation returned on the China. August
I3elmont Jr. of New York was among the
passengers. In epite of his lack of Inches

to the green and white band which bound
his unblocked Panama, was conspicuous
in the throng that crowded the China's

wounfled. The press was destroyed and
the paper's library burned in the con
flagration which followed the explosion.
The press- censorship was. of course,
very strict, but the military blue pencil
was the " least of Artemleff's troubles.
Time and again publication was delayed
because the fragment of a Japanese shell
had pied a foxm or two and once While
the paper was in the press a shell dropped
through the roof and burst on top of the
printing machine. Two members of the
Novoi Kray's staff were killed and six

r-ap^r, expired the day Stoessel surren
dered. It suspended publication only
v.-hcrt all the subscribers became prison

t<sfTÂ« loot for the little brown conquer
ors.
"To General Kurokt," said the colonel,
â¢"\u25a0hat story, which reaches him at fre
cuent intervals in various forms, is an
endless source of amusement. He loves
to hear it told, and Jf the man that first
invented the yarn could hear the general
laugh he would know that in one quarter
at â¢ least his fiction was popular. No
Polish blood runs in Kurokl's veins. He
1? all Japanese, and proud of It."
General Mac Arthur was at Mukden
when Colonel Crowder left, but had
r^.iched there too late to see anything
of the fighting. Colonel Crowder does not
expect that there will be any general
:":phUng in Manchuria for some time.
The boom of the Japanese guns before
which Port Arthur fell is still echoing in
the pars of Colonel P. ArtemicflT. who for
Eorvco years published a newspaper in the
citadel town, and who arrived here yes
trr.jay on the liner China.
MAKES KI'IIOKI LAUGH.
It has been written time and again that
CJeneral Kuroki is of Polish ancestry.
Knterprisir.g writers hayÂ«Â» even unearthed
his genealogical tree, on the branches of
v hich they wove a romantic story of a
noble family driven from home by Rus
sian oppression, taking root in Japan, and
from there coming: forth in the form of
the redoubtable little general to take re
vrngefui swats at the armies of the
â¢wicked Czar. On this subject Colonel
Crowder unsealed his Ups.
Among the passengers who arrived
yesterday fxotn tie Far East on the
liner China was a man who for more
than a year has accompanied General
Kurokl In his whirlwind campaign against
the forces of the Czar. Unfortunately
for a world which would like to hear a
first-hand and scientific account of these
marvelous doings in Manchuria the wU
bess new In this city is s. United States
army officer whose duty will compel him
to first tell his thrilling tale to President
Roosevelt and Secretary of War TafL
"*I would like to tell you all about it,"
said Colonel B. H. Crowder of the Gen
eral Staff of the United States army, yes
t*rday, on board the China, "but my lips
are sealed until I have made my report
to the Secretary of War."
Colonel Crowder was one of the first
American army ofttcors to be detailed for
duty as a military observer with the
Japanese army. He lost no time in get
ting to Tokio, and was assigned to the
column commanded by Kuroki. He saw
the battle of the Yalu. and was with the
Japanese general until after the long and
bloody fight at Mukden. The arduous
campaigning in between these engage
ments tried Colonel Crowder's health,
and he h.as come home * good deal of an
i-ivalid.

Rheumatiam i* a mighty bad disease. Even
In mild case* the biood is' poisoned and the
general constitution is weakened by It. When
rheumatism is known to be In the - system
the only safety lies in getting rid of It as
quickly as possible.' for there i.-* no telling
v.lun -the mild cases may devclo'p serious
(â¢ymptoms. There are few more painful con-
ditions than those brought about by . a bad
attack of rheumatism., but aside, from the
pain there are other dangers. . The power of
an arm or a leg is frequently destroyed by
an attack of rheumatism that stiffens . the
joints or sbrivels the muscles. - More incur-
able strokes of paralysis are due to the poison-
iiiE fnSuence of rheumatism upon, the general
system . than ia ! credited :by the' medical \u25a0 pro-
fetKion. Mild races of rheumatism are quickly
cured by ' Electrp-Chemistry and ' all poisons
are thrown out of the system, which make*
It Impossible for the ' disease 'to ' return, liut
Uw wonderful tblpt , about it all. Is that
Electro-Chemistry^cure* those cases which,
teem Incurable and hopeless under all other
methods. The cure uf Mrs. Mary Ulvest. a
well-known lady of Oakland. living -at 1522-
Forty-fourth street, Oakland, ig a case In
pcist. Mm. Rlvest's ; rheumatism settled In
her risht knee. The knee was swollen' to
three or four tiroes" Its natural size, it was
ptrfectly stiff. ' the \u25a0" circulation had*. almost
entirely etcrped. and the pain was unbearable.
Her home physician was giving- her morphine
that she .might Ket a little rest. The tiswie
about the knee turned black,: as if. gansrene
Would set in. and , two well-known and re-
liable physicians â¢ had advised the sufferer, to
have the lee amputated above '. the - knee' to
save her life. All this sop a to show that
the case of Mrs. Rtvest wan Just about . as
bad as a ca?e could I.e. and notwithstanding:
Hie severity, of.it Electro-Cfcemistry cured the
sufferer in two months* time at a small cost.
.When we consider that during her two months'
treatment by Electro-Chemistry ; ehe never ex-
ptrlesced a minute's discomfort in takihs the
treatment. â¢ and . when we consider \u25a0; that -\u0084. her
great sufferinc was lessened from the very
first treatment and', that she did not! take .'a'
single dose of - morphine .'. after * beginning \u25a0. the
Electro*Chemlc course It Is .no wonder that
people talk of thl* wonderful cure and. that
the ha;>py' cured patient is tending^ everybody

"I feel a great Interest in what you are Join*
for the Improvement of "Presidio Terrace.' to
beautifully located next to the Presidio Reser-
vation. I have noticed that such plan* hay*
been followed in other cities, â where they hava
proved universally popular and successful â
adding to the beauty of the residence portion.
of such cities. The scheme Is a splendid on*
and Its success la assured."
JAMES D. PHELAN:
"I note with much satisfaction that you hayÂ»
subdivided Prectdlo Terrace In a manner which
recalls the beautiful park residences of other
and more progressive citiva. whose example we
may well follow. The scheme will promote
nelghborllness baaed en common interests, and
at the same time the grouping of the houses
within the Inclosure should Insure privacy and .
protection. The plan seems Ideal."
A. SBARBORO:
"I congratulate you upon the splendid scheme
for residence plats as shown by the plan of
Presidio Terrace. I hava seen similar place*
In Europe and In some cities of the Eastern
States, but I believe that Presidio Terrace will
surpass them all. The location being adjacent
to the Presidio, families with their children
can stroll at their pleasure and enjoy the beau-
tiful' view of the bay and ocean. The sunny
exposure of the tract cannot be excelled. Ac-
cept my heartiest congratulations for the beau-
tiful and praiseworthy enterprise which Is sur*
to meet with great favor."

thetic influence en the general list. Ontario
and Western, waa again In large request -and
rumors were revived of the guarantee of a
dividend by New York Central and New' York.
New Haven and Hartford Amalgamated did
not revive effectually from the effect cf thÂ«
realizing movement and closed with a net loeÂ» !
of 14. The taking op of the advance by the '
VnKed Etates Steel stocks was regarded as of
good augury for the whole market, ac the per
pistent heaviness of these stocks had been a â¢
drag, occasioning tendencies to rally 'during
the lart'few days. There were rumors of fa- !
earnings making for the current quar
ter in connection with the advance. Some ef
fect was produced by the appearance of nego
tiations locking toward bringing about peace
between Russia and Japan. The eubsJdfcnce of
OM violent storm in the Equitable controversy '
was a relief to sentiment, although that sub
ject continued to be actively discussed In thÂ«
financial world and to be regarded as fraught
with potrlbllltieÃ of further harm. Railroad
traffic officials spoke In a cheerful tone of
business prospect*, the volume of offerings be
ing held well above Uft year* level. The
fesllng regarding the crops on the wfcole was
more bopeful than haa recently prevailed and
contributed materially .to the firmness of
Ftnrks. The money market retained tt* unruf
fled Eurfare. notwithstanding the weakness cf
the Saturday bank statement snd some further
lares money transactions, including a transfer
through the Fubtreaeury of ?2.000.000 to San

COTTON â Before the opening we thought the
rrarkci would prove Â« good sale on ihie bulge
and advised liquidation against the purchases
mtute en the break early Saturday morning. A
Â»->f>d many other operators adopted the same
policy, and thie combined celling, with the
other bear crowd aiwumlng a more aggressive
attitude, readily filled up the demand, and
Ikttr the market broke sharply on what was
1 cared to be a rather general reselling move
ment, influenced by t^ie fine M-eather map Over
Saturday, which makes a full week of almost
ideal weather condltlors in nearly all parts of
cotton States for finished planting and culti
vating the crop. Later the market develcpt-d
further weakness on a succession of bear at
ta.ckÂ£. which brought out further liquidation
r.rd Southern There was a rather gen
*"tel disposition to discount a bearish weekly
Goverament crop and weather bulletin to-Sior
row. and. although Liverpool maintained most
o! its improvement and New Orleans was well
i-uppcrted, prices here broke shortly after 1
o'clock tc a level or 10 to 15 point* below Sat
urday's close and 22 to 28 points from thla
morning's -opening. While the market was being*
puunded arid Etop orders were being reached Uy
tbs bears. thÂ«re were gooa buying orders on
â¢.!-â¢\u25a0 decline^ snd }at<>r the market steadied anl
recovered. It is our opinion the crop haa made
a considerable Improvement during the latt ten
clays and we expect to see to-morrow's Govern
ment report refer to the completion of planting
snd fields .being freed from grass and weeds.
?TOÂ«:ksâ The feature of the etock market

began to-day in some s-ctlons" of. "" Southern

v The United States Circuit Court of
Appeals yesterday handed down a de
cision affirming the order of the United
States' District Court enjoining Myra
E.! Wright. William H. Wjrlght and W.
L. Cobb from selling property of the
Jersey Island Packing Company under
the power of. sale given to them in cer
tain trust deeds. J. C. Campbell and
W. H. Linforth appealed to the United
States Circuit Court against the order,
and the appeal was successfully fought
and defeated by Walter Mansfield and
Nathan Frank, attorneys for the other
creditors.
In affirming Judge de Haven's order
the Court of Appeals says:
We are of thÂ« cpinlon that th* District
Court had Jurisdiction to make thÂ« restraining
order. Of thÂ« property of that order, assuming
that the court had power to make it. there cos
bÂ« no question. All the property o> the alleged
bankrupt was about to be sold at the In
stance of Its treasurer, to obtain satisfaction
of debts owtns to him and his wife, sscurM
by the trust, deeds. These facts evidently
came to the- knowledge of unsecured: creditors
but a few days before the proposed sale. They
had no time In which to brinz thÂ« creditors
together or to secure bidders for the property,
or otherwise to protect their interests. The
sale of the property under th* trust deeds
would have extinguished tie equity of re
demption. By selling tho property under thÂ«
direction â¢of the bankruptcy court the Inter
ests of all parties may be protected, aad thÂ«
trustees of the. trust deeds will not be Injured.
They will be entitled to tha proceeds of the
sale ito thÂ» same extent that they would have
been -If they had themselves made the sals
under the power of sale given them by the
trust deeds.

The Finance Committee reported that
negotiations are pending for the. purchase
of land for the opening of Brannan street,
between Ninth and Tenth;, owned; by the
Pacific Improvement Company." The com
pany claims ownership of 4355 square feet,
which it offers to sell ror J4355 if: the city
will pave and sidewalk , its j frontage at
the corner of : Brannan and Potrero . av
enue. The City Attorney was requested
for .an j opinion as to *the- rights of ; the
city in the matter; \u25a0 â¢ .
The Merchants* Association has re
quested the Board : of s Public Works to
provide that the repaying of Mission
street, between Fourth; and Fifth, shall'
be with basalt blocks . laid on a con
crete foundation. The association
points. out that the wholesale section
will extend out Mission street , as far
as Ninth and Mission . wil be one of .the
principal thoroughfares for 'hauling
from downtown. It is also recommend
ed \u25a0; by the association lhat all streets
south of Market, from East; to . Ninth,
with .the exception "of \u25a0 some of.'the^
alleys,"- shall be payed with basalt'
blocks.. The: laying ;Of a "pavement*. on.
Mission street, below Ninth, as slippery
as either, asphalt or bituminous rock
is declared to promise a. serious ob
stacle to the easy hauling of freight
and other merchandise. \
The ordinance ordering the. paving with
asphalt of Mission street 'southerly from
Porter avenue at an expense to the city
of $13,000 was passed " print.
Joseph Worcester, on ' behalf of .. prop
erty owners ! on A r allejo street, - between
Taylor, and \ Jones, I submitted j a plan -for
the change of grade and the approach
from Jones street 1 as suggested "by Archi
tect Burnham .to save for the block its
commanding view. The plan, is similar
to the one for the approach to Francisco
street from Leavenworth as suggested by
the ; Street ' Deoartirient. Worcester ' says*
the Jones-street side will be architectur
ally.'treated so 'that it (.will, be an orna
ment to the hill iand the Taylor-street
face of the hill : will be treated - similarly,
though the plan;' ls not yet ready.The
committee said it is favorable to the plan,
which the Board of Works .will probably
carry- out. r V V , â¢
"You first make an estimate* of $1900,"
said D'Ancona to Hewitt, "for work- on
two. blocks, of Fourth street; then you
raise it to $2100 and now you want $711 74
more. -There seems to-be no end. to. the
matter and the deficit in the fund keeps
growing." ' ' ;.' V
The committee allowed the $495 ' asked
for, but took no \ action on the request
for $711 74, saying it desires to stop Hew
itt from overdrawing his appropriation in
the future.

\u25a0Now come the statements .'ots Nichols.
The youth says : that the profits ~of | the
advertising scheme were - not as â¢ great as
he expected. In order to- increase ~ the in
terest of his business he purchased little
gifts : for â¢ various young women. Jlt was
the non-payment, of; these debts: and the
suspicious , actions of ; Nichols "< in
from place to place i that caused his 'ar
rest on Saturday. He still maintains^ in
nocence ;of any attempt to i deceive and
says : that his bills ; will be" paid at once.
It ; was erroneously : reported that
Florin \u25a0 H. . Jones was - arrested. : but -.the
fact was that he was only questioned
by Chief Dinan in regard to certain
matters and then' released. â¢
" Professor | Bernard told a ) highly inter
.estlng/; story ", to the \ attorney . yesterday
afternoon, and it corroborated the Â» tale of
Nichols. : Bernard is a nervous | little .man
of ' light . complexion^ apparently : of superb
education. . He is* a graduate of Jan
Eastern school of medicine. and practiced
for'some time at^his profession. He~had
been, a rare student and in his searches
through the books of the ancients he first
learned. of the mysteries of occultism. So
infatuated was ;he, with the study of
theso fanatical rites that he gave. up his
practice as a . physician' and became V*a
hypnotist. ; ' ~;' y \u0084 r
TRIED TO ADVERTISE BUSINESS.^
-It was last year that he first met Nich
ols. ," The latter icame to .^Bernard %,wi^h'
the proposition that he, would do the ad
vertising for the healer and /in ; return
was to get half of the profits of the,busi
ness. The first , move 'that Nichols made
was the organization* of ! the" Tantrikas, a
cliib whose . membership- roll contains j the
names of the sons i of -: :any,"of ; the; most
prominent people of the "city, .^ declares
Nichols. T,hl3 club hired Bernard, to
teach them the philosophies =of the " East
Indians. " ' \ , -â¢. ; \u25a0
Attorney Burchard has talked with the
parents and friends of his client. and says
that _ unless a specific charge ..is- sworn to
very soon. the boy's relatives will pay the
debts and ;. Nichols; will be released. The
police are .still searching for., some one
who can bring a charge against ; their
prisoner. The j, are not investigating the
Tantrikas nor the connection of Hypno
tist Bernard with the caae. . ':".

by. the police last Saturday on . the com
plaint of several merchants who said they
had 5 been defrauded by him, â¢ is '( still con
flned* to a cell of the City Prison."' No
specific v charges have been brought

to ; the ', shopkeepers from v , whom :he ob
tained the goods, but Watson ; D. t Fennl

Optical Company, notified the police this
morning that; ho had been duped by Nich

to swear" to a' complaint . charging .the
latter with obtaining goods under, false
pretenses. The goods obtained from, the
California Optical Company consisted or
a set of ! fine opera glasses, : valued at* s3o.
> Dr. Pierre 'A. Bernard, the mystic hyp
notist with whom young Nichols has been
associated, and who was present 'at many
of, the alleged seances and hypnotisms, ln
various; San '\u25a0; Francisco lodging-houses,
came over from Oakland yesterday and
spent the entire afternoon closeted I with
Attorney D."WV Burchard. who is in charge
of the affairs' of the Imprisoned j boy. The
hypnotist denies that the^club; of which
he .was the instructor had any other pur
pose than to \u25a0 delve 'deep Into the .mys
teries of the science of occultism, arid to
probe; the 'intellectual discoveries of the:
ancient : people of India. He* says ' that
the , band of Tantrlkas, of which he wa3
the teacher ' and Nichols a member, was
never \ engaged in any kind of ; criminal
practice, i.or did they ever, smoke -opium
at any of their meetings. His visit to this

ly to . state to Nichols 1 attorney the facts
concerning the relatlonshe had with, tha

. Grades \u25a0were ordered changed on
Willard street, at Frederick; the name
of Michigan avenue was changed to
Palm avenue: Daniel McPhee was
granted a spur track permit in the'Pot

City Attorney Long's recommenda
tion that the board accept the offer of
Mrs. Eleanor Martin to convey to the
city a lot at the northwest corner of
Fell street and Van .Ness avenue, form-
Ing. a part of the new public library
site, for $146,500, instead of $164,000,
her previous offer, was approved. A
demand for the amount was ordered
drawn in her favor.
The sum of $250 was added to the
$750 appropriated for the purpose of
investigating . available . sources of
water supply to San Francisco. The
new budget allows $5000 for the pur
pose. thus 8 making $6000 available for
expenses in that connection.
The sum of $804 50 was allowed out
of the urgent necessity fund to install,
a. lighting and silent signal system in
the new engine-house in the ' Richmond
District.
The board next. took up the
veto of the ordinance 1 prescribing:, the
manner of expending funds ' for \u25a0 the
erection of buildings under the bond'
issue, the invitation of competitive
plans for the same and for the appoint
ment of Louis S. Stone as supervising
architect. The matter was referred to
the Joint Committee on Finance and
Public Utilities. . ' V-, '.;.t,.':'^
The expenditures will necessitate the
levying of a tax of $1,104 for. city pur
poses, but the ordinance fixing the tax
rate will not be parsed until' the budget
is returned by the Mayor, who has ten
days In which to approve the . measure
or veto any specific" appropriation con
tained ; therein. . _
The Board of Supervisors' yesterday
finally passed the ordinance fixing' the
appropriations in the municipal budget
for the^next fiscal year. The ordinance
provides for "expenditures aggrregating:
$7,765,620, of- which- nearly. $1,000,000

white, crusty scab would form and

torture and humiliation I suffered for
fifteen years. I tried many doctors,
and all kinds of treatments, but could
get no help, and I thought there was
no hope for me. A friend told me to
get Cuticura. I did, and in three days
my. head was as dear as ever. I ap-

also taking a hot bath three times a
week, and using the Ointment freely
after the bath. After using one cake
of Soap and two boxes of Ointment I
was completely cured, without mark
or blemish. I was so pleased I felt
like running down the street to tell
every one I met what Cuticura had
done for me. If any one is in doubt
about tbi6, they may write to me.
