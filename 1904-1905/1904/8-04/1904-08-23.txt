"With 'each additional report from

RICHMOND, Va.. Aug. 22.â In his
answer to the suit brought against him
by Mme. von Roques, mother of Mrs.
Florence Maybrick, D. W. Armstrong
intimates his belief that the British
Government was tricked into giving
Mrs. Maybrick a ticket of leave.
The answer is in the hands of Philip
B. Shield, an attorney of this city, to
be filed in the Chancery Clerk's office.
It is this action which the friends of
Mrs. Maybrick used as a means of per
suading the British Government to re
lease her.
The Baroness von Roques brought
suit several years ago, alleging that
Armstrong had persuaded her to part,
for *10,000, with lands which he subse
quently sold for millions. Mrs. May
brick was eaid to have an interest in
this property, and it was to punish the
persons who had defrauded her that
the British Government allowed her to
leave prison on a ticket of leave.
In his answer, Armstrong maintains
that she had no Interest In the lands.
The answer Is voluminous, consisting
of fifty typewritten pages, and goes
minutely into the details of Arm
strong's transaction with Mme. von
Roques and her agents and repre
sentatives. ,
The answer, upon its face, appears to
give rise to two principal questions,
the first being as to whether the estate
of Mrs. Maybrick, of which so much
has been heard in connection with the
agitation for her release, Is, a myth;
and, second, as to whether, apart from
what the facts may be as to Mrs. May
brick's interest, the transactions be-

CEDARTOWN, Ga., Aug. 22. â "Jim"
Glover, a negro, was shot to death to
night near the home of the white girl
he had attacked and his body was
dragged a distance of about a mile
into this city and burned on the pub
lic SQua.re. A mob estimated at 500
composed the shooting and burning
party.
The crime for which the negro was
thus punished was an attack upon
Levia Reeves, the 13-year-old daugh
ter of a well-known farmer. The
story of the crime was the most re
volting that had ever been given to
the public from this immediate sec
tion. After the little girl had pro
tected the negro from the attack of a
large dog owned by her father he fol
lowed her to the pasture whither she
was taking a cow, caught her, choked
her into insensibility and left her
bleeding and unconscious in the field.
This occurred early this morning.
Bloodhounds were on the negro's trail
all day and he was captured some time
late this afternoon and carried to the
home of the girl, who unhesitatingly
identified him as her assailant.
In the meantime a crowd of 500
persons gathered and summary Jus
dice was meted out to the negro as
soon as it was learned that the young
girl had positively identified him.
The negro confessed his guilt. Im
mediately the crowd took him away
from the posse that had captured him
and his body was riddled with bullets
and afterward burned.

miles north of the town of Tehachapi
and tunnel No. 12 is completely block

LOS ANGELES. Aug. 22. â An un
expected rainstorm coming from San
Bernardino to the coast and spreading
out like a fan traversed the valleys of
this and Ventura and Orange counties
this afternoon, the precipitation in
many places being three-fourths of an
inch. In the mountains the rainfall
was much heavier, in places amount
ing to two inches or more. Only at
Covina is any serious damage report
ed. Hay in places was damaged, but
the loss will not be serious. This 13
the second heavy summer storm with
in two weeks, but this time it was un
accompanied by a high wind.
COVINA, Aug. 22.â A terrific light
ning and thunder storm, accompanied
by heavy rain, burst over this city
shortly before noon to-day, and the
absence of fatalities is considered
miraculous. The flashes came la quick
succession and appeared to strike every
time.
A large tree severity- five feet high in
the grounds surrounding the residence
of Mrs. Platt-Larkins, at the corner of
Center and Third streets, was splint
ered into a hundred parts, many of
them the size of fence rails. The frag
ments, some weighing 800 pounds, were
scattered from eighty to a hundred
feet in every direction. Mrs. Larklns
and her daughter, who were alone In
the residence, were stunned by thÂ»
shock.
The Covina Valley Meat Market, two
blocks to the north of the Larklns
house and In the very center of tha
business section of the town, was next
struck. The lightning melted the tele
phone and electric â¢wires, burned out a
transformer, twirled the steel cleaver
out of the hands of a butcher named
Monroe, who was working at the block,
and fired the woodwork Just above the
doors. By the quick application of a
few bucketfuls of water a serious con
flagration was averted.
The next flash struck the substation
of the Pacific Light and Power Com
pany, near the Southern Pacific depot,
setting fire to the transformers, which
are a total loss. The fire burned fiercely
for several hours. This leaves the city
in total darkness to-night and until
such time as the transformers can be
replaced. The loss to the company will
amount to 512,000.
A barn on the Winkler ranch was
struck and George Jeffrey, who was
feeding the horses, was stunned by the
shock. Damage was also done to the
local telephone system. Steady rain fell
all this afternoon.

ASH FORK. Ariz.. Aug. 23.â Traffic
on the main line of the Santa Fe Rail
road is again completely tied up. A
ever* washout occurred this after- I
noon near Peach Springs and all
trains are beinj? held at that point.
The heavy rains and cloudburst of last
week washed out a large portion of
the roadbed in the vicinity of King
nxan and at other points near 'there
and the downpour to- Jay " evidently
wrecked the- temporary repairs.
Another severe washout has occurred
"at Yucca, a small Etation near Sellg
man. Ariz., where the flood of lastnveek
carried â¢ away a large bridge and the
etone foundation, weighing over 600 j
tons. Train No. 2, from Los Angeles
to Chicago, managed to get over the
temporary structure this afternoon, but
now it is reported that a great volume
of water is washing over the tracks.
The Santa Fe officials who are now at j
.Ash Fork have ordered a tie-up on
westbound passenger trains.
Xos. 7 and 3 and the Culvert special,
. which is carrying delegates to the
. Knights Templar convention in San â¢

Train No. 7 has sixteen cars, two of
which are filled with soldiers from Co
lumbus, Ohio, en route to the Philip
pines. It was thought possible that the
Santa Fe trains could be switched over
to the Southern Pacific tracks and sent
to California by way of Phoenix, but
reports were received here late to-night
that the Southern Pacific is experienc
ing even greater trouble.

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 22. â The
storming of Port Arthur, which the
foreign dispatches say Is progressing,
is riveting all attention. The' brave,
stubborn resistance which General
Stoessel is making is evoking high
praise and the War Office and public
are hoping almost against hope that
he will be able to hold out in spite of
the heavy odds against him. The latÂ»
est news, that the Japanese are un
able to obtain a foothold in Louisa Bay
and at the most westerly fort of the
inner defenses, is considered encour
aging.
An official dispatch from Rear Ad
miral Prince Ouktbmsky at "Port Ar

two officers were killed on board the
ships which returned to .the harbor
after the fight of August 10, but his
information about the condition of the
ships is not satisfactory, the Admir
alty explaining that , he probably
avoided going into specific details ow
ing to fear that the dispatch might
fall into the.hands of the Japanese.
News that the Port Arthur squad
ron has again sailed out Is expected at
any hour, as Prince Ouktomsky's or

ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 22.â .The
dispatches saying that energetic action
had been taken by the American war
ships at Shanghai to protect the neu
trality of China has aroused the â¢live
liest satisfaction in official and unof
ficial circles here. The protected
cruiser Askold and the torpedo-boat
destroyer Grozovoi will be disarmed.
The Admiralty realizes that It would
be folly to send the ships out to face
the Japanese squadron in the offing,
and, as announced in these dispatches
last week, had already decided that
the ships shall be disarmed.
The refusal of the Russian Consul
General at Shanghai to comply with
the requests of the taotai is. it is said
at the Foreign Office, due to the fact
that no agreement had " previously
been reached between the Chinese and
Japanese authorities, and Russia did
not propose to allow the Chinese to
disarm the ships, as they did in the
case of the Ryeshitelni at Chefu, with
the possibility that they might subse

WASHINGTON. Aug. 22.â Consul
â¢ General Goodnow cabled the State De
partmpnt that the conference of foreign
Â« Con5uls at Shanghai, which adjourned
this monning, was resumed in the after
noon. After a good deal .of discussion
no was offered for the present
condition of affairs, and it was sug
gested that each Consul report directly
* to his own Government, asking what
had'bopn done, if anything. Goodnow
Jiad no g'jg:geF!ions to offer to the State
Department. He has been given in-
Vtruttions which, it is believed, will
prevent the United States being en
tacgled in the settlement of the ques
tion *of China's neutrality at Shanghai.
It is asserted positively at the Navy
Department that the American fleet at
Shanghai is not charged with the pro
tection of Chinese neutrality by any
special instructions. The officials here
are* convinced that the Japanese have
. no intention of violating Chinese neu
â¢ trality. and, furthermore, that they
wÂ«uld not Jeopardize the immensely
valuable foreign interests of Shanghai
c*by making the harbor a naval battle-
LONDON, Aug. 22.â Interest in official
diplomatic circles; in London centered
: at Shanghai, where British interests are
strongly appealing for protection. Great
Britain, however, would prefer. that the
United States take the initiative in
maintaining the neutrality .of China,
Great Britain's position as the ally of
Japan making her situation delicate
unless her interests are directly- men
aced. It is true, the officials Bay, .that
Great Britain agreed to "the principle
of the neutrality of China, but she did
not agree to enforce it. Throughout the
discussion relative to the Askold and
Grozovoi she has thus far held the view
that it is none of her business, and the
extent to which Great Britain has gone
has been to point out to China the im
portance of maintaining her neutrality,
whichever belligerent is thereby affect
ed. The British Government hopes that
the pressure of the consular body at
Shanghai will make China take action
to enfore her neutrality, thereby estab
lishing a precedent that may prevent a
repetition of similar incidents in the
future.
Regarding the Askold and Grozovoi,
the Russian embassy here asserts that
the mere fact of a' cruiser repairing in
order to put herself in a seaworthy
condition Is no violation of China's
neutrality and that after the repairs
are completed the question whether the
ship shall be dismantled or must put to
sea can be determined. It is further
claimed that, should the Askold and
Grozovoi go to sea, they have the right
to leave together and not necessarily
separately.

"Our Thirteenth Regiment was

"As nearly as can be ascertained,
this assault cost the Japanese 10,000

The explosion of. one mine destroyed

volcano of stones dismembered the
bodies of the soldiers, while the sky
was lit up with a purple glare and the
mud walls of the Chinese village were
thrown down by the shock. After this
fight General Stoessel collected 20,000
Japanese rifles.

frequent hand-to-hand encounters, the
Russians leaving the trenches to fol

The Hipsang was passing Pigeon
Bay, within the three-mile limit, on
July 16/ when the forts fired four
times across her bows. She Refused
to stop, according to the story that
was cabled from Chefu shortly after
the occurrence, and four shots were
then fired into her side. As she still
continued to steam ahead a Russian
torpedo-boat destroyer ran out and
sank her.
SHANGHAI, Aug. 22.â Evidence

The name of the torpedo-boat de
stroyer which sunk the Hipsang is not
known. No provocation of any kind
for ihe sinking of the steamship had
been given. She was on her regular
course from Newchwang to Chefu and
her lights were burning brightly.
There were seven Europeans and
eighty-three Chinese on board the
Hipsang. The Europeans and sixty
nine of the Chinese were saved unin

Lieutenant Molas also distinguished
himself. A shell entered the compart

BRAVERY OF A LIEUTENANT.
Subsequently, learning that the men
were depressed by the fact that he had
been wounded a second time, 'the cap
tain insisted after the. second dressing
on being supported along the decks to
the casements, encouraging the sailors,
saying:
"I am alive, brothers. Go on smash
ing the Japanese."
I When Captain Andreieff of the Rossla
ascertained that only three out of her
twenty big guns could be fired he cool
ly gave orders to get explosives in read
iness to sink the ship. Captain An
dreieff is usually nervous, but In battle
he was surprisingly cool. When not
giving orders he was cheerfully con
versing with the gunners at their, sta
tions.
Captain , Berlinski . .was . killed by a
splinter -which struck him on the head
at the outset of the fight.
No sooner had he entered than a shell
struck the foot of the tower, glancing
upward to the overhanging cover, and
entered through the peephole, killing a
lieutenant and two j quartermasters,
wounding two lieutenant,? and again
wounding Captain Dabich in the head
and breast. Not a single man in the
tower escaped. There being no one to
steer, the ship, the captain, severely
wounded though he was, dragged him
self to the wheel and managed it until
another quartermaster had been sum
moned.
Some - .of - the - Japanese- shells per

Garments therein v.:r'p torn to shreds,
but a mirror was, not scratched. Photo

In another part of the cruiser the
walls were blackened by the smoke of
a fierce fire in which eight men were
burned alive,, yet an almanac on the
wall was not even scorched. Aboard
the Gromoboi a shell entered the Avard
room and wrecked the furniture, but a
parrot cage was untouched.
AH the officers are full of praise for
the coolness and bravery of the men,
who died in the battle without a mur
mur. Comrades took their places with
out awaiting orders. It was deadly
work on the upper deck, where, the
gunners were without protection and
shells striking, bursting into a thou
sand fragments, kiljing and wounding
men until the deck became a veritable
shambles â strewn with dead and dying
and slippery with blood. Not a single
gunner protected by casements lost his
life. The value of protective armor was
demonstrated, whenever shots struck
the armor portion of the vessel.
Many deeds of heroism were displayed
during the ; five hours' battle, but the
greatest praise of all belongs to Cap
tain Dablch of the Gromoboi, who re
mained at his post on the bridge from
the beginning to the end of the fight.
When wounded in the back he persisted
in resuming command directly the

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 22.-r-Initial
steps were taken to-day tor the .first
application of the terms of the na
tional irrigation law to an extensive
district In California and If the deal
Is consummated It will mean the be
stowal of governmental assistance in
the reclamation of more than half a
million acres of land In San Diego
County. At a meeting of representa
tives of the Water Users' Association
of the famous Imperial Valley and the
officers of the California Development
Company an option was given on the
immense canal system of the company
by the terms of which the develop
ment company t agrees to accept
$3,000,000 for Its 'holdings. The final
determination of the matter Is condi
tioned, first, upon the acceptance of
the terms by the majority of the mem
bers of the Water Users' Association,
and second, upon the approval of the
plan by the officers of the reclamation
service of the United States Govern
ment. If the sale is made the Federal
Government will pay over the money
and the actual users of the water will
be given an opportunity under the na
tional irrigation act to repay It In ten
annual installments. Once those pay
ments have been made the actual set
tlers acquire title to the water.
The system is probably the moat ex
tensive in the West. It consists of a
large canal taking water from the Col
orado River, near the International
boundary and traversing a portion of
the Mexican domain and returning to
California to the Imperial Valley. From
there the main canal laterals have been
run, which have converted a section
that a few years ago was. a barren
desert Into hundreds- of thriving
ranches.
It is known that the officers of th*Â»
reclamation service . Trill approve the
scheme and It will be submitted to the
Secretary of the Interior for final ac
tion so far as the Government is con
cerned.
A mass meeting will be held at Im
perial to-morrow to approve the ac
tion of the Water Users' Association
and then the whole deal will be placed
in the hands of the Government. Its
consummation will mean the adding of
several million dollars' worth of prop
erty to the tax lists of the State and
particularly to that of San Diego
County.

uneasy and so dfd O'Brien, but the sit
uation was relieved when John W.
But trom this one can turn to a contem
plation of the campaign before us. I con
gratulate you upon the bright prospects ot
Mctory for our party, both State and national,
in November, at. Louis has given us a ticket
that inspires cur ix>i>c. No Democrat with
such leaders can now find excuse to falter at
the threshold of victory. The atandard-bearer
of our party is a man that would rather bs
right than President, and now I ask that
every Democrat of California lay aside every
thought of personal reward, appoint himself
a committee of one and see that every Demo
cratic vote is cait for Parker and Davis. If
you have any quarrel in your neighborhood
end It and hand your hammer to your Re
publican neighbor, with my compliments. I
firmly believe in Democratic principles and
equal righti to all, and no man should penult
his personal desire* to Jeopardize the Interests
of the national party. When victory Is ours
next NovÂ«mber I shall ack no reward for
anything I have done or may do that has
hdr*d or will help â¢ to win th* victory. ' I
will return to my home and with the rest of
you enjoy the c<*!temptation of the fact that
we are once more In DowÂ«r.
One would think from the row that has
bf-n going on in San Franciuco for th? last
month that McNab and the Ht.r>Â»-Â« and Carts
were the nominees of. the St. Louis convention.
It U a shame, this bickering and broil. There
thculd be less talk in San Francisco of th3
McNabites and th,.- Horses and Carts and
mew of Parker and Davis. If 1 held tne
power I would find out whence comes this
ttrife and I would read out of the party every
man (."at is res:>onsible fcr the trouble if it
is not soon settled.
REBUKES SAX FRANCISCO.
I have no political ax to grind. I have no
political aspiration?. I am as high up on
the political laridfr at 1- want to no and i
appreciate the lact that the position ot chair
man of the Democratic state Central Com
mittee is a h'.ch one. and from this posit. on
I will advise San Franc'.sco.
However. 1 deem it an honor to call this
convention to order, 'or the Democracy of tne
&U.te was nevtr so well united bÂ«:ore, with
the possible exception ot San Francisco. And
to you, tentlcmen of San Francisco, if the
Democracy you reprerent is pure you will get
into line and <:uit your boiting.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 22.â Timothy
Spellacy, chairman of the State Central
Committee, called the Democratic con
vention to order at 2:30 o'clock this aft
ernoon. IVIai'or D. C. Clark of Santa
Cruz was introduced and delivered an
address of welcome. Mayor Clark, after
extending the hosnitality of the city to
the guests within her gates, talked a
little politics. His words gave a line
on what was to follow â harmony. He
aid bickering should cease and on the
.djournment of the convention the del
egates should return to their homes
conscious that the Democracy was
united and that success in November
was in eight.
Clark's remaiks were applauded, and
he gave way to Chairman Spellacy,
who also had some strenuous remarks
to make regarding harmony. Getting a
good range on Gavin McNab's eye and
now and then glancing at James
O'Brien of the "Horses and Carts."
Spellacy braced himself up and said:
Ladks and Gentleman of the Convention
<here he glanced at the summer girls in the
gallery): 1 titiit you will not construe tne re
mark? 1 am about to EOalu as c\jnÂ»t.tutlnz a
si<ttch. Ii my v^nerntea anc:Â»ur. t.nan li^.u.
heard 1 was about tc make a ?pÂ«ech he would
tun. uver In i..- grave, put .cotton in his
ears and say: "lJon't do It. Tim, xor you'va
chi'dren or your own."
Regarding the question of a contest for
the chairmanship of this convention, all I can
say la that It makes no difference who pre
sides. If this Question Is permitted to comÂ«
to a contest Mr. Dockweiler might be elected,
or I mlKht be elected. That -'cuts no !ce": it
makes no difftrenre. We are but a small frac
tion of the party, both of us put together.
The Democratic uarty In tho past has been
too much tern by strife. If */e exhibited the
same zeal" fighting the comrcon enemy that
wo do In the battles In our: own ranks we
would have no trouble In winning out in Cali
fornia. We -must unite for thÂ« common good.
The success of the Democratic electoral
ticket at tho cominz election la th- question
to bÂ» flrrt considered and we must send
Parker electors East, that he may be placed In
the Presidential chair.
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen and
Fellow Democrats â I am overwhelmed with
the flatterlnr encomiums I have listened to
her* and I can hardly find words with which
to express my appreciation. However. I deem
It proper Rt this time that I should sÂ»y a few
words "cfininK my position. , As much * as I
want to preside over this convention â what
Democrat would not want to preside over so
dlstlnguistrd a body? â I am nÂ«re to fulfill my
duty as I find It, and there are other matters
I ronrider more Important than my personal
desires or tbe iÂ«. rsonai deslnta of any man
that T.ay be here. You ' h"Â»ve " h-tard the
chairman of 'he State Central: Committee and
others express their views on': the question of
harmony, and U is my desire to ds fine my po
sition in this regard.
When Barrett again took his seat
among the delegates an expectant si
lence fell upon the convention, to be
followed by applause and then three
cheers when Edward White arose and
started for the platform- to withdraw
his name. . >
"I consider It a distinguished honor
to introduce to you the brother of Ste
phen M. White," said Chairman Spel
lacy in presenting Edward White to
the convention. % White then said:
WHITE WITHDRAWS NAME.
Any man who might fear the passions of
the hour or dread the- patoonu â I have a name
for him. And I know the name of another
man., who, when he thought the advancement
of his political interests might injure the Dem
ocratic cause, stepped down and sacrificed him
self to party interests.
I want to present to you to-day the brother
of that man, Edward White. Gentlemen, you
need no credentials from Edward White. You.
KÂ«-ntlemen from San Francisco, have known
of him and his work. You, crentlemen irom
Santa Clara, have been identified with him in
his life work. Ycu, gentlemen from Santa
Cruz, know him, for lie has spent his days
here. He has held public offices which he has
filled without loss of luster. I know not
what his plans are at this hour, but I know
that I can bring you Sils name In confidence
that you wilÂ» honor it for the sake or one who
once sacrificed himself for the Democracy.
The Democracy has been Kksned unto a raft
that has teen threatened by the rocks and has
drifted hHhcr an.i thither. Gentlemen, I can
not explain thise political dissensions. Xo
matter what issue may be we intend to
stand by our leadtr. Judge Alton IJi Parker
of Now York. San Francisco will not falter
in her duty. She may be henceforth referred
to in the light cf the unbroken tankB of the
Democracy of San Francisco. At the St. Louis
convention we had opportunity to show our
Republican brothers that we can adhere to
our uarty urincfr>lÂ«s.
J. J. Barrett of San Francisco, selected
to carry out the wild scheme of protest
framed by. the "Horses and Carts," fol
lowed Mitchell to the platiorm and
placed Edward White of Santa Cruz in
nomination. Barrett said in part:
BARRETT NOMINATES WHITE.
In pn-Eentlng to you the choice of Los An
geles. Isidore Dockwoiler, let us stand flm
tor a united Democracy in California and all
the time for Allen B. Parker.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Mitchell arose to nominate Isidore B.
Dockweiler of Los Angeles. In part
Mitchell said:
Only a thort three months ago the Demo
cratic party Â»Â«)Â¦ tern by dimension and much
bitter ie*-Iins existed amons thosr who should
have cive.i their best endeavors to bring the
organisation to the front. One could not find
amontr the moyt optimistic party prophets one
vrho was willing to forecaM a promising future.
Then there occurred that which brought to
attention that th;re had developed a teellng
for unity. After the California delegation had
icsri;-tfrri-d the will of the people or' this t-'tate
the delegates to the Xati.-nal Democratic Con
venticn r.roucht before the party the name
iÂ»f Alton B. Parker. What has been the result?
TnÂ«? spirit of harmony has reunited every con
tending Jacticn and there is not a spot in
all the length and breadth of this country
where there Is lack of party understanding.
I would be df lighted to honor the brother cf
Stephen M. White, and whatever may be the
r^Eult I must support the party. In the name
of harnriory.
Brother of Lamented Senator Re
stores Unity in the Party.

Ex-Congressman Thomas Geary
then interjected a small surprise. He
moved that the chair appoint a com
mittee of ten to name ten electors for
the entire State. He made no mention
of having a desire that the Congres
sional districts should suggest the
names of district electors, to be passed
upon subsequently by the committee
and ultimately by the general conven
tion, but" his motion went through
unanimously. The chair named the

COMMITTEES ARE NAMED.,
Joseph Rothchild of San Francisco
moved that an adjournment of an
hour be taken that the chairman
might select the committees, but he
withdrew the motion while Frank H.
Gould of San Francisco presented a
resolution, preceded by an eloquent
eulogy, expressing the regret of the
convention at the death of "Uncle"
Jo Hamilton, who, since 1S50, "In
darkness and light, in rain and shine,
went forth whenever his services were
required to preach throughout the
State the principles of Democracy he
held dear throughout his lifetime."
The resolution was adopted by a ris
ing vote.
A motion that Secretary W. P.
Ketherton and Asslsant Secretary-
Thomas Cleary, appointed by the citi
zens of Santa Cruz, be made perma
nent officers of the convention carried.
An adjournment was then taken.
J. W. Mitchell of L,os Ansales then
moved that a committee of ten at
large and five from each Congres
sional district be appointed on per
manent organization and order of
business. Ed E. Leake of Yolo moved
that a like committee on credentials
be appointed and Judge Raker of SIo
doc moved that a similar committee
oh Dlatform and resolutions be se
lected by the chair. The motions pre
vailed.
In the withdrawal cf Mr. White I am again
placed undtr deep obligations to the White
family. It was under Hon. Stephen H, White
that I was trained. 1 wish to add that I am
here as nu man's man. but am working for
the success of the Democratic ticket.
down to victory
J. C. Sims of S*n Francisco moved
that the secretary be instructed to
cast the ballot for Dockweiler. The
motion was put and carried. White
of Santa Cruz. Barrett of San Fran
cisco and Mitchell of Los Angeles were
appointed a committee to escort Dock
weiler to .the chair.
As Dockweiler was on his way to
the platform a delegate proposed
three cheers for harmony and they
were given with a will, though the
dark looks of the Horses and Carts
of San Francisco demonstrated that
they were not overjoyed. ' In address
ing the convention Chairman Dock
weiler r.a'A:
Gentlemen of the Convention: I wish to re
turn my sincere and grateful thanks for the
honor you have conferred. This honor has not
been given in recognition cf myself alons.
Throughout every section of the country
there can be found only Parker and Uavis
Democratr. Let us stand by our colors and go
"Well." said Chairman Spellacy,- "I
guess the fight for chairman has
dwindled down to a contest between
myself and Mr. Dockwelier. But I will
put Mr. White's motion."
DOCKWEILER IS CHOSEX.
There is somethlns I esteem higher, how
ever, than the privilege of leading a conven
tion â the success of the ticket. If a contest
for the chairmanship of this convention re
sulted In the loss of one vote for the Demo
cratic ticket la November I would greatly re
gret the fact, and that this shall not occur I.
In the spirit of harmony, desire at this time
to withdraw my name as a candidate for
chairman of this convention. WÂ« must be
un}ted and we must have the entire Demo
cratic press Â«f the State behind us. We
must all labor for the common cause, that
when eHction day Is over victory will rest
with our party. 1 wish to return to all of my
friends my sincerest thanks for the loyal man
ner in which they have stood by me.
This is not the first time a man of my name
and my blood has stood upon the platform of
a Democratic conventicn and sacrificed his
personal dt-slres for the high Interests of the
party. Therefore, I move for the unanimous
election of Isidore Dockw;ller of Los Angeles
for chairman of this convention.
We commend the platform adopted by the
Democratic National Convention and the
speeches of acceptance of our nominees fcr
President and Vice President to the careful
perusal of all persons, irrespective of their
political belief.
We hereby indorse the "Camlno Real" move
ment, and We are in favor of every effort to
improve the roads and highways of the State.
The matter of securing better road conditions
is of the highest Importance to the people of
the State of California. This can be accom
plished on!y through the co-operaticn of coun
ty. State and nation, and we therefore pledge
our candidates to Congress to use all fair and
honorable means to secure such assistance from
the Federal Government as will enable our
State and county governments to establish a
!>ys;em of public highways which will redound
to the credit and prosperity of California.
We favor tiie adoption of the proposed San
fort! constitutional amendment, which provides
fcr the convening of thÂ» Legislature in Feb
ruary, instead of January, for the extension
of the legislative term to eighty days and the
cutting oft of an army of useless attaches,
thereby saving the State over $600 per day dur
ing a session.
We approve the proposed constitutional
amendment providing for district courts of
appeal and recommend that the same bs
ado:>tcd.
We favor the submission to the people o!
California of a proposed constitutional amend
ment providing for the initiative and referen
dum in all State, county and municipal mat
ters.
Under the beneficent effects resulting from
Government operations under the Newlands Ir
rigation act â a measure framed by a Demo
crat and passed aÂ» a result of the energetic
efforts of Democrats In Congress â California
Is drst'-ned to become a State of small but
numerous holdings. This measure. If enforced
with the spirit that animated the Democrats
through whose efforts it was passed, will re
claim vast arid tracts of the State for home
eeekers. and the resulting small holdings wll
not only contribute to the State's domestic
development, but will operate as a beneficial
preventive of land monopoly.
We pledge our nominees for" Congress and
likewise our nominees for the State Legisla
ture to co-operat* for the purpose of securing
such national and State action as will moet
effectually secure to California the Irrigation
of all of the arid lands of the State.
We recognize the mining Industry as one of
the great factors of California's prosperity.
Th? encouragement by proper legislation and
suitable appropriations of all classes of min
ing would greatly Increase the- output of gold
in this State. We favor the immediate en
forcement of the Caminetti act and demand
that the. work cf erecting restraining barriers
and other works on the tributaries of the Sac
ramento. San Joaquin and other rivers be ener
getically hastened on all sites contemplated
b/.such act and we pledge our nominees for
Congress to use all honorable endeavors to
secure necessary appropriations for these pur-
PO!-Â»Â«.
The prevention of the denudation of the
Kreat watersheds of the State we believe to
be of great importance to the future of Cali
fornia, and we declare it to be the policy of
the Democratic party to support and further
such legislation and executive action, national
and State, as may preserve to the State these
great sources of water supply.
for the Improvement of our rivers and har
bors.
State Chairman Spellacy Delivers a Rebuke to the
Warring Clans in San Francisco.
Timothy Spellacy. chairman of the
oDfemo'cratic State Committee, made a
â¢ good impression to-day. Whether he
ygill prove 'a veritable <# anger' is yet
to be determined.
The platform committee to-night
â¢ approved the Appellate Court scheme
find "the 52.000,000 bond proposition
â¢ to extend the San Francisco seawall.
It # is -expected that the Republican
State* Convention, to assemble here
next Thursday, will give similar in
dorsement.
The Napa and Solano Senatorial
nominations may go over until early
in September. There is talk that May
or Lynch of Vallejo will be put into
the field to oppose Ben F. Rush, the
.republican nominee.
Farmer Ed "White sacrificed a cher
ished ambition to bring about unity in
the party. John W. Mitchell of Los
Angeles eloquently eulogized the pro
moters of peace. John J. Barrett, Fire
Commissioner of San Francisco paid
tribute upon tribute to the genius of
the White family and finally indicated
that honorable peace would be Indorsed
by .the "Horses and Carts."
All of the party leaders to-night are
blessing the peacemakers. Gavin Me-
Nab Is satisfied. The man slated by
the "orgsjiiration" for chairman of the
convention was easily enough chosen.
Four days ego McNab gave out the
Â¦word that Isidore B. Dockweiler of
LÂ«es Angeles would wield the gavel,
end Dockweiler is on the throne, ably
supported by McNab, the power behind
the throne.
Seven hundred and thirty delegates
Were elected to represent the party in
the State Convention, and owing to
Â£trifÂ«t envies, jealousies and disap
pointments nearly 400 duly accredited
representatives of the party remained
at home, in sheer disgust. There has
been, so far, no rollcall of the conven
tion for the reason that there is no
printed roll. A call of the roll would
demonstrate the lack of attendance.
The slim attendance at the Con
gressional district conventions is re
markable. 'The unlucky number of
thirteen delegates was the record in
the Sixth. The counties comprising
the Second Congressional District
rteeted 112 delegates and at least
eighty-five failed to attend the Con
pressional district convention in the
ladies' parlor of the St. George Hotel
to-night. Only twenty delegates at
ter.ded the Seventh District conven
tion, and the Fourth had less than
that number present. Nominations
for Congress are made as a matter of
routine to preserve party organization.
j3en F. Geis was nominated for As
semblyman to-day to represent the
district, including Lake, Colusa and
Glenn counties.
The convention will finish to-mor
row and adjourn sine die. Several
Senatorial and Assembly district nom
inations probably will be made before
the delegates leave town.
EAKTA CRUZ, Aug. 22.â Harmony
reigned for two hours In the Demo
cratic convention to-day. There are
elgcs that the period of peace may be
prolonged for two or three days.
f^edai Dliyctch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug.- 22.â The com
mittee on permanent organization and
order of business met at 3 o'clock in
the St. George Hotel. After much pre
liminary discussion, largely due to ig
norance throughout the committee of
parliamentary rules, the following
order of business was agreed upon:
Firstâ To recommend that the tem
porary officers of the convention be
made permanent.
Secondâ Reading of the report of ths
committee on credentials.
Third â Report of the committee on
platform and resolutions.
Fourth â Report of the committee ap
pointed to name electors.
Fifth â Nomination of Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court, to fill the
vacancy occasioned by the expiration
of the term of Justice Lozigan. ap
pointed to succeed, until the next gen
eral election, the late Justice Temple.
Sixth â Ratification of the nomina
tions for Congress by the eight dis
tricts of the State.
Seventh â Appointment of a commit
tee on auditing.
Eighthâ Appointment of a committee
on vacancies.
It was apparent from the discussion
in the committee on permanent or
ganization that the scheme behind the
appointment of the committee of ten
to name electors was not generally
understood and that a fight may de
velop in consequence. The members
of the organization committee labored
under the delusion that the committee
on appointment of electors was but a
repository body named to appoint two
electors at large and then receive sug
gestions from the eight Congressional
districts as to the choice of these dis
tricts of .electors to represent them
in the college in the event of Demo
cratic success in this State. But thn
is not the condition. The committee
upon the appointment df electors is
receiving suggestions from no one as
to whom it shall name for presenta
tion to the convention for electors.
When this gets through the heads of
all the Democrats here things are
liable to happen and the much
vaunted and pampered condition of
harmony may be shattered at a blov>-.
And one more question came before
the committee on organization that
caused some uneasiness and much ris
ing to questions of Information. A reso
lution was presented for adoption and
incorporation in the report of the com
mittee authorizing the chairman of the
; State Central Committee to appoint
j subsidiary committees to aid in the
Presidential campaign. Many pro
fessed to see in this an effort to legal
ize the enlargement c-f the central com
mittee itself, but when the political in
nocence of the resolution was ex
plained the alarmists subsided and it
was adopted. The committee then ad
journed.
The committee on credentials .met
shortly after 7 o'clock this evening and
rushed Its business through in a twink
ling. Not a single hitch or fight marrcl
the proceedings and after a brief ses
sion Chairman Ed E. Leake of Yolo
announced the result, stating that the
report had been unanimously adopted.
The roll call of the convention was
adopted as prepared by the secretary of
the Democratic Central Committee. All
proxies were at once verified and en
tered upon the roll call, after which
the committee adjourned.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 22.â The
up-coast forest fires which have been
burning for the past three weeks are
still raging, and the latest news from
the north is that two more logging
camps have been destroyed. Bull's
camp at Serge Inlet has been de
stroyed, and Ireland's camp has also
been wiped out. Machinery worth
$20,000 was destroyed. Men and women
are fighting the fires in every direction.
The big fire blazing at SHamon Cut,
across the railroad and skid roads of
Camp F of the Hastings Sawmill Com
pany, shut out the working force and
equipment from the shore. When the
foreman, James Springer, saw the fire
heading for. the railwav line he called
for volunteers to rescue the camp out>
fit. A train was hurriedly made up to
pull out the donkey engines to the
shore. The engines were saved, but'
the ride through the blazing timber
cost every man the loss of whiskers,
hair and clothes.
Before the volunteer train crew
reached safety at the beach they ran
a race with death, and their escape
without serious accident Is looked
upon as marvelous.

Within five minutes a dispatch was
sent to the aged mother in Oneida
County, New York, and another to the
Oneida County Attorney, informing
him of the happy reunion.
The brothers have decided to return
to the old home at once to prove con
clusively that Cornelius still lives.
"Yes," was the reply.
The next day after the departure of
Cornelius a search was begun. The
search was in vain and It was rumored
that Cornelius had been killed by his
brother. Edward was afterward tried
In the courts of Oneida County, but
set up a claim of self-defense and the
Jury disagreed. A second trial fol
lowed and he was discharged.
Five years ago Edward came west
and located at Grand Rapids. To-day
hÂ« went to a local hotel to meet a
friend on business. While there a
stranger accosted him with the ques
tion:
"Are you Eddie Van Lieu?"
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.. Aug. 22.â
Two brothers, one of whom had been
tried for his life on a charge of mur
dering the other, met unexpectedly
at a hotel in this city to-day. They
are Edward S. Van Lieu of this city
and Cornelius S. Van Lieu of Pasa
dena, Cal. The meeting cleared away
a mystery of long standing and re
lieved one of the brothers of a shadow
which has rested upon him for years.
Twenty years ago the brothers had
quarreled in a tavern in Oneida
County, N. Y. After the quarrel Ed
ward returned to his home at Vernon
Center, resolved never to recognize his
brother again. Cornelius made a like
resolution and, having no family, de
termined to go West and forget. He
left without seeing any of the mem
bers of the family or his friends and
without giving them any idea of his
plans. ? : Â¦:

Superior Judge William M. Conley
received the nomination for Congress
in the Sixth Congressional District
and was accorded a demonstration by
his enthusiastic followers when his
name was put on record as the unan
imous choice of the delegates. Q. W.
Mordecai placed the Judge in nomina
tion and paid a tribute to his fealty
to the party and his record as lawyer
andÂ»jurist.
E. J. Livernash was the choice of
the Fourth Congressional District dele
gates after a brief session, held imme
diately after the adjournment of the
afternoon session of the convention.
Hugh O'Neil was chosen chairman and
J. D. Faulkner temporary, secretary.
It was the intention of part of the
delegates to put the nomination of
Livernash over until to-morrow morn
ing, but Chairman O'Neill suggested
that it were well to bring the work of
the committee to as speedy a termi
nation as possible.
J. J. Sweeney nominated Livernash,
who was chosen unanimously. Sweeney
then moved that the chairman be
given power to appoint all committees
provided for by the rules of order.
The motion prevailed. Sidney L. Van
Wyck moved that the delegates resolve
that they adopt the platform of the
St. Louis convention and that they
also resolve to adopt the platform that
will be presented by the committee on
platform and resolutions. -The motion
prevailed and the delegates adjourned
to meet at the call of the chair.
The Fifth Congressional District
delegates met in the convention hall
at the adjournment of the afternoon
session and elected Joseph Rothchild
temporary chairman and Edgar C.
Hurlbert temporary secretary. The
convention will meet again at 9:30

Thomas J. Geary made q. straight
out Democratic speech, placing Theo
dore A. Bell in nomination. Bell was
chosen by acclamation and in his
speech Â¦ of acceptance promised a

eran from the Yountville home pre
dicted that Bell would get 90 per cent
of the soldier vote as a reward for

The Eighth Congressional District
will nominate a candidate for Con
gress to-morrow morning. The dis
trict convention met this afternoon
and appointed Timothy Spellacy
chairman and George E. Farrand
of Ventura secretary. J. M. Barne
berg of San Luis Obiapo was sug
gested as the choice of the dis
trict for elector, though the action of
the convention in appointing a com
mittee to select electors deprived the
district, of the right to elect Barne
berg. No nomination for Congressman
was made-. It being the opinion of the
delegates to the District Convention
that it would be best to wait until
after the committee on credentials of
the State Convention reports to-mor
row morning.
Late to-night It was announced that
neither State Senator Emmons nor
Editor Harrell of the Bakersfleld Cali
fornian cared to accept the nomination
for Congress from the Eighth. As a re
sult, the wires are being warmed up
In an effort to discover an available
Democratic candidate to grapple with
the Republican nominee in that district.
There was practically no contest dur
ing the preliminary caucuses of the
delegation and the nomination was
foreshadowed early in the day. The
delegation, thirteen in number, met
In the courtroom of Superior Judge
Smith at 7:30 o'clock in the evening
and elected De Witt Clary chairman
and M. J. Smeltzer secretary.
Considerable interest was manifest
In the candidacy of Frederick P. Fellz
of Salinas for State Senator In the
Thirty-first Senatorial District. Feliz
put up one of the most spirited cam
paigns In the section and met with
but little opposition in his effort In
the valley. He went to Santa Cruz
with the undivided support of the dele
gation. M. J. Smeltzer placed Feliz
in nomination and the motion that the
secretary cast the ballot was carried.

The Second Congressional District
convention was attended by twenty

fairs on the sidewalk, went to the St.
George Hotel and held the session in
the ladies' parlor. D. W. Carmichael
of Sacramento was chosen chairman
and Ed E. Leake of Yolo secretary.
Some flamboyant resolutions recently
BELL IS REXOMIXATED.
To-night Caminetti received a mes-
Eage from Jackson, Amador Clunty,
announcing the serious illness of his
aged father.
But this did not satisfy those pres
ent. More speeches were made and no
one would hear of any one else but
Caminetti. At last the latter^, driven
into a corner, in a brief and simple
speech said that his chief objection to
the nomination was that he was not
in a financial position to make the
fight and, therefore, would not under
take to win while thus crippled.
But even this did not satisfy his ad
mirers. They still insisted that he
make the fight and Coonan said that
a committee would be appointed to
supply Caminetti with the needed
funds. This seemed to smooth matters
to some extent, but Caminetti was re
luctant and it was finally decided to
give him until to-morrow to make up
his mind.
SANTA CRUZ. Aug.' 22.â A. Cami
netti of Amador County was the unan
imous choice ol the Democrats of the
First District for Congress. Although
entirely without opposition, Caminetti
refused to accept the honor which his
associates sought to thrust upon him.
Several times did he arise and raise
his voice in protest. Finally the dele
gates compromised and decided to give
Caminetti till 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning to think the matter over.
Caminetti was nominated by Judge
Raker of Modoc, who took occasion to
pay a glowing tribute to the choice of
the gathering and. to dwell upon the
fact that he had accomplished much
for his district when he served as a
Representative some years ago.
At the conclusion of Raker's speech
Caminetti arose and, after thanking
the assembled delegates for the honor
they had conferred upon him, said that
he was rot in a position to accept the
nomination and requested the delegates
to lay aside his name and agree upon
some one else.
First District â A. CAMIXETTI of Amador (may decline).

In giving thÂ« views of the associa
tion after the adjournment of the meet
ing Secretary L. C. White said that po
far as the association is concerned
there is practically nothing to be
gained by the conference. He added:
This phase of the situation was thor
oughly reviewed and discussed at a

owners' Association last night, when it
\\as agreed that the executive commit

Building Trades Alliance
Claims Rival Bodies Are
in League. With Employers
PLANS A PEOSECUTIOX
Contractors Said to Know in
Advance What Bids Are to
Be Put In for Certain Work
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â The Building
Trades Alliance, a union organization,
through counsel to-day made a fresh
attack on the Building Trades Employ
ers* Association by placing certain doc
umentary evidence before Acting Dis
trict Attorney Rand for the purpose of
ascertaining whether this evidence was
sufficient to begin the prosecution of
certain employers. The charges against
the employers are that they blacklisted
members of some of the trades affiliated
with the alliance and conspired to re
strain trade by. entering into agree
ments with unions whereby the mas
ters' â¢association profits over outside
contractors. Â«
The matter was, considered at length
to-day at a conference In the District
Attorney's office. After this meeting it
was reported that nothing would be
done by 'Jerome, as evidence of suffi
cient weight to warrant action had not
been produced by counsel for the un
ions.
The unions, It Is believed, Intend to
proceed against the employers on the
strength of the opinion handed down
on Saturday last by City Magistrate
Ommen In the action brought by As
sistant District Attorney Rand against
Donald Call et al., charging conspiracy
between the bosses and the unions In
the etonecutters* trade. Magistrate
Ommen held that any agreement en
tered into between unions and the mas
ters* association whereby the masters'
association knew in advance of putting
in bids Just what bids would be offered
and profited thereby was conspiracy.
It is reported that counsel for the
Building Trades Alliance to-day pro
duced evidence to show that similar
agreements to that of the stonecutters'
have been entered into by at least one
other union, which act is In favor of
the masters' association of that trade.
Rand, said that when the new State
law known as the Prince statute goes
into effect on September 1 next a close
watch will be kept on employers, who
can be prosecuted for giving bribes or
extortion money to business agents or
other representatives of unions.
The presenting of the evidence against
the employers by counsel for the alli
ance is considered the first retaliatory
measure on the part of the unions since
the Building Trades Employers' Asso
ciation started in to break the building
trades strike in this city by engaging
union men who sign individual arbitra
tion agreements. 1
GREEKS URGED TO STRIKE.
Consul and Priest Appeal in Behalf
of ' Butchers' Union.
CHICAGO, Aug. 22.â Special services
were held to-day in the Greek Church
on Johnson street and Rev. George Go
geades and the Greek Consul, Peter
Salopoulos, denounced their country
men for taking the places of strikers in
the stockyards and urged them not to
report for work to-morrow morning.
Rev. Mr. Gogeades told his parishion
ers that he would refuse to administer
the sacrament on August 2S to any
Greek who was at work in the stock
yards.
While priest and Consul were lectur
ing inside the church prominent Greek
business men addressed the crowd on
the streets, where an overflow meeting
was held. They urged their country
men to join the labor unions and not
allow themselves to be used as tools to
reduce wages and the standard of liv
ing among American citizens.
STOCKHOLDERS DEPORTED.

DENVER, Aug. 22.â A special to
the News from Silverton, Colo., says
that a party of citizens from Telluride,
including prominent' mine managers,
enme over to the property of the
Black Bear Mining Company, located
in Ingram Basin, on Sunday afternoon
and compelled all the miners to come
out of the shaft and line up before
them. Four of the miners were* se
lected from the party and told to leave
the neighborhood and not return.
They were accused of being "per
nicious agitators" in behalf of union
ism. All of the deportees are stock
holders in the Black Bear. The men
arrived in Silverton after walking
several miles over rough mountain
trails.
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 22. â H. N.

SACRAMENTO. Aug. 22.â The lid
was removed from Sacramento to-night
and the town thrown wide open to all
forms of gambling prohibited by the
State law. The two leading hotels have
opened bank gambling rooms, and old
gambling houses, where the lights have
not burned for years, are brilliantly Il
luminated and offering all manner of
games. The faro tables appeared to be
the most liberally patronized, although
other forms of illicit games seem popu
lar.
The police officers who were known
to be hostile to the gamblers have been
placed on outside beats and their as
signments given to men who pass by
the gambling houses without noticing
them. In the midst of it all, Mayor "W.
J. Hassett, who promised that he
would not permit gambling in this city,
preserves silence.
A resolution introduced by Albert
Elkus in the Board of Trustees to
night to cite Chief of Police Coffey for
willful neglect of duty was lost by a
majority vote, and Sacramento official
dom has practically given notice to the
rest of the State that Sacramento is a
wide-open town and shall so remain
during the two weeks of the State Fair.

Smelter to Stay Â»t Keswick.
REDDING. Aug. f 2.â -The report
that the Keswick smelter was to be
moved to the vicinity of Martinez was
a mistake. The company is now urg
ing all the. small mine owners in this
vicinity to bring in all of "the fluxing
ore they can get out and the company
is employing all the men it can get ,
There are only two of the five furnaces !
at the smelter running because of the

"This act of Weinhard'a will save
the school district between 5500 and

day, "and we will be able to heat both
the old and the new part of the Atkin

that they bring authority to offer

The Governor was followed by Mayor
George H. Williams of the Rose City,
who In an equally warm manner ex
tended to the delegates the hospitalities
of Portland.
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 22.â The first
two sessions of the American Mining
Congress, which assembled at the arm
ory In this city to-day, adjourned about
5 o'clock this afternoon until to-morrow
morning at 9:30 o'clock after a day de
voted to listening to addresses of wel
come and their responses and the intro
duction of resolutions. So many of the
latter were presented that the resolu
tions committee is flooded and will be
unable to make Its first report until to
morrow afternoon at the earliest.
The report it Is expected will pre
cipitate the first real display of
strength between the delegates from
those cities striving to secure the loca
tion of permanent headquarters of the
congress. This became apparent when
a resolution was Introduced by Dr. J.
M. Buckley of Missouri proposing an
amendment to the charter taking out of
the hands of the body as a whole the
seleotion of the convention city each
year and making It one of the preroga
tives of the board of directors.
The convention was opened with
prayer, and then on behalf of the State
of Oregon Governor Chamberlain wel
comed the delegates and visitors. The
Governor's welcome was a hearty one,
and frequently during the course of his
speech he was greeted with prolonged
cheers.
delegates who arrived to-night, it is
thought, will also enter the struggle
for the alternative honor as well as
for the permanent headquarters.
President Richards, in his annual ad
dress to-day, emphasized the necessity
of securing Government co-operation In
the, mining industry In the form of a
shipment of mines and mining. He
called attention to the assistance the
Government had rendered in the distri
bution of the public domain through
the Department of the Interior; to the
farmer through the establishment of
the Department of Agriculture, and to
the remarkable work already accom
plished by the new Department of
Commerce and Labor. He asserted that
if the mining industry would give him
assistance It would be productive of
good not alone to individual pursuits,
but would affect every line of Industry
in the country. In pursuance with this
idea he proposed the following resolu
tion:
"Be It . resolved. That the American
Mining Congress, In annual session
assembled, believing that the time has
arrived when a Department of Mines
and Mining would be the means of
placing the mining Industry on a plane
commensurate with Its independence to
all industrial progress, urges the Con
gress of the United States to at once
create a Department of Mines and
Mining as one of the great executive
branches of our Government."
To-morrow's programme includes the
addresses of Senator John HI Mitchell
of Oregon and Chancellor E. Benjamin
Andrews of the University of Nebraska.
Owing to the fact that to-morrow night
will be the only time when Chancellor
Andrews can be present and fill his
other engagements, an evening session
of the congress will be held.

Reynolds says there are few San

Only in peaches and apples does the
East pretend to rival California. No
peach as large and luscious as the
Golden State article Is grown in the
East, however, and California pro
duces some apples that hold their own
with the best Eastern article.
Edward A. Hall, secretary of the
Pajaro Valley Board of Trade, has
written the California State Commis
sion for display space for some fine
apples to be sent on. Hall sayg that
as the crop is lighter this year than
usual finer specimens can be secured.
He says that Newtown pipprins. Lang
fords, Skinner's seedlings and Bell
flowers can be sent on that will do the

SANTA ROSA, Aug. 22.â Fire broke
out this afternon in the Ursuline Con
vent, and, though the flames were
brought under control before much
damage was done, great excitement
was created among the sisters and
pupils and a large number of citizens
who soon gathered at the scene.
The fire started In the basement of
the main building, where workmen
were repairing furniture, and soon
spread to the floor above. Mother
Agatha, the superior, gave orders to
remove the contents of the building
and then turned in an alarm. By the
time the Fire Department arrived "the
nuns and pupils had deposited most of
the portable articles on the lawn.
Within twenty minutes after the de
partment arrived the flames were un
der control. The damage amounted
to about $1000.

fhe Congressional committee to call
upon Carnegie for additional funds. It
may cost some budding metropolis a

let a email matter like that deter her
from securing a visit from a world rep

FRESNO. Aug. 22.â Mr*. Mar, E.
Johnston lies cold in death here, while
in San Francisco her son. Harry Har
ris, is slowly dying. The remains of
Mrs. Johnston have been embalmed
and are being held by the undertaker
till her son dies, that the funeral may
be a double one and mother and aoa
be cremated together.
Harry Harris, the son, was formerly
a telegraph operator here for tie Pos
tal Telegraph Company. He contracted
cancer of the throat and went to San
Francisco, where Dr. Rixford of Lane
Hospital performed two operations.
The cancerous growth was particularly
malignant and about a week ago ths
mother was informed that her boy
could not live. Since then she has
pined away. Last Friday she received
a letter telling her tfcat Harry bad but
a day or two to live. The blow waa
too much for her and Saturday even
ing she passed away.
The body is at the undertaking par
lors, where they have received orders
to hold it till the son dies. His deatii
Is expected at almost any hour. Tnen
the two bodies will be cremated, aid*
by side. It was the mother's wish and
It will be carried out.
Many of them were killed or
drowned during the retreat and others
sought refuge on an island belonging
to Argentina.
It is rumored in Formosa that As
uncion has surrendered, but the ru
mor cannot be confirmed. The revo
lutionists have seized another steam
ship loaded with cannon, rifles and
munitions of war.
There has been further fighting in
the republic of Uruguay. In a hand
to-hand fight between Uruguayan rev
olutionists and the Government forces
at Santa Rosa, held by the Govern
ment force, thirty-five men were
killed and eighty-five were wounded.
The town eventually surrendered and
the Government troops retired by wa
ter.
The Paraguayan capital is suffering
from the scarcity of "provisions. The

limited to eix biscuits daily. General
discontent prevails.

ST. MARIES, Idaho, Aug. tl. â De
tails have been learned of the killing
of Ed Bentley, a timber locator, who
was shot and wounded some time aso
and who, the other day, was murdered
on the trail near Mica Creek. Frank
Lindsey, a compar' n of Bentley. was
shot through the arm. Lindsey says
they were at the creek, drinking, when
a shot from ambush struck Bentley.
who fell. Lindsey says as he ran to
cover a second shot struck him in the
arm. He got behind a tree and heard
the assassins fire fifteen shots at the
prostrate body. Sheriff Manning and
the Coroner arrived here to-day on a
tug and went up the swift water of the
St. Joe in a canoe to the scene of the
tragedy. Deputy Sheriff Elliott has
gone with a posse and eight horses to
head off any one coming over the
Santa trail.
The trouble that culminated in thia
tragedy has been brewing for months.
It is said that "cruisers" in the em
ploy of big lumber companies have em
ployed men to jump settlers' claims, on
the ground that their lands were more
valuable for timber than for agri
culture. Two months ago Bentley, who
was charged with claim-jumping, was
warned to leave the country and, fall-
Ing, was shot and wounded from am
bush.

wish to say to you. My dear freshmen, you
were Just now so thoroughly at the top of
things in your high eehools that it will be hard
for you "to realize how thoroughly you are at
the bottom of things here. Ycu will be wel
comed, you will be viewed with much interest,
you will be treated with much courtesy, much
condescending courtesy; you will be enter
tained at Stiles Hall and other halls; you will
receive deitcate attentions from the various
fraternities, but It is well not to be deceived;
you are at the bottom, it will be very hard
to believe it, when you find yourselves centers
of Interest at the fraternity houses; but, after
you join, you will be undeceived. You arc at
the bottom, and the absolute bottomness of it
will be only the more certainly set forth when
some high soaring, noble soul among you in
vindication of his slighted worth shall gather
his manhood about him, and, smiting off the
shackles of inglorious obscurity, shall seize
(he brush and paint upon the football fence the
gleaming figures naughty- eight.
The plain, wise thing for a freshman to do is
to settle d^wn.to work as soon as possible and
retire from the limelight. It will be very easy
If you follow out all the distractions of these
tirs>t few weeks to wreck ycur college course
at the start. The men who are esteemed and
followed in later years of the course will gen
erally be from the number of those who at the
beginning lie low and saw wood. There are al
ways some forward persons who are anxious
to organize freshmen balls and freshmen teas,
and who bubble with ctass enthusiasm, but
they are apt to transfer their allegiance to the
next following claps and graduate with it, if
at all. Some people are born prominent, some
have prominence thrust upon them, but, pray
take my advice, and,, If you were born promi
nent, try to hold destiny In check during your
freshman year.
The university opens to you here and now
her gates and rails you to her feet, that she
may teach you various lessons out of various
lores. It is her sovereign deÂ»ire not that you
be learned, but that you be free, that you
learn to love the noble, that you gain visions
of the larger life, that you stand fast in the
truth. Will you hear her? Will ypu give her
your hearts?
The Glee ' Club sang a number of
songs during the meeting and in the
last the entire assemblage joined.
President Wheeler's address to the
new freshman class entering the Uni
versity of California was a word of
warning against being too prominent in
the first year of their college careers
in merely class affairs, in balls/parties
and such. Work ought to come first
and play afterward. To illustrate his
meaning, President Wheeler seized
upon a slang phrase- to help him out,
his advice being -to "lie low and saw
wood." Here are Px-esident Wheeler's
words, spoken at the first university
meeting of the new term this morning
in the Harmon Gymnasium:

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214& Center Street, Aug. 22.
Carrying out the last wishes of his
friend and fraternal brother, John
Strelghtif, Deputy Coroner for Berke
ley, climbed Grizzly Peak this morning
and scattered the ashes of John Allen
McDonald, suicide, to the four winds.
Grizzly Peak is the highest point in
the hills overlooking Berkeley, the fa
vorite objective point for those who
like to see the panorama of the Golden
Gate, the bay and its environs. From
the single Moulder that crowns the peak
the Deputy Coroner stood' and scat
tered the dead man's ashes from a
copper urn so that the winds could
catch them and carry them down the
mountain side.- This done, Mr.
Streightif hurled the urn away and
now it, too, lies In" some sequestered
spot in the' brush.
John Allen McDonald died a suicide's
death in October of last year. He sent
a bullet into his brain. When his body
was found this last word to the living
lay beside it:
"I want John Strelghtif to conduct
my funeral.- My remains I want incin
erated and it is my wish that he scatter
the ashes to the winds." v
Mr. Strelghtif and the -suicide were
long-time friends and Odd Fellows.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 22. â The Trustees
held. a general meeting this evening to
discuss the recent Sherman-street fire,
in which so much property was lost-
There has been so much talk about
the fire that the entire Board of Trus
tees, nearly every member of the Fire
Department and many citizens were
present.
The Trustees questioned carefully
the members of the Fire Department,
who all agreed that in three minutes
after the alarm came in there were
two streams on the fire and in eight
minutes every bit of apparatus in the
town with the exception of â¢ the one
steamer was in action. . .
Chief Krauth of the Fire Depart
ment then explained why the steamer
was not put in action. He said that it
was the fault of the driver that the
machine was not taken out, even
thought it was being painted, but even
had the steamer been in action the
water pressure was so small that the
steam machine would merely have
concentrated the twelve hydrant
streams that were. being used on the
fire into two 'Streams, there not being
water enough in the mains, and it was
his judgment that twelve small streams
were better than two large ones.
There were a number of addresses
by prominent citizens, among them be
ing E: R. Anthony, E. J. Holt, G.' E.
Plummer, P. W. Barten and others.
There were no definite charges made
and Barten told the audience that the
tewn did not appreciate what a good
Chief it had for their department.
Some of the citizens wanted more
equipment for the Fire Department
and some wanted larger water mains
and more pressure.' These two ques
tions the Trustees will have to grap
ple with in fixing the tax lavy.
President Forderer at the end of the
discussion said the Trustees were satis
fied with the handling of the fire.

* %
It is true that there are a great many details
to attend to, and that there has been much
work connected with this department, but de
tails cannot interest the general public. One
of the greatest sources of work la the decision
of the Supreme Court which permits appeals
to be made by Chinese who have been refused
permission to land by local immigration in
spectors, to the secretary of the department.
ThiÂ« has added greatly to the work of the
department head.
I did not come out here to "do nolltlcs,"
as has been said: I came out solely to get a
few affairs- in shape. I may possibly deliver
one political address, but no more. All that
I have to say politically concerns, the Repub
lican nomination in rny old Congressional dis
trict, and there I am glad to see that the party
has made an excellent choice.
1 There are many matters of the great
est interest to the Pacific Coast in gen
eral and to the San Francisco Bay dis
trict in particular that come under Mr.
Metcalf's department. He will be in a
position to advance the commercial in
terests of this section very greatly, and
looking toward this end two important
functions have been planned. One is a
dinner to be v given Mr. Metcalf by the
new Union League Club of Oakland. It
will be participated in by the Board of
Trade and the Merchants' exchange.
This will be in the nature of a welcome
and compliment to Mr. Metcalf by his
own townspeople. A larger dinner is, to
be given in San Francisco, at which
the various commercial bodies will be.
represented to further the commercial
interests of the bay section. ....
Mr. Metcalf has under his control "all
of the immigration work of the United
States, also the lighthouse department.
He advanced some information upon
these points that is of interest to this
section. He said that Immigration
Commissioner Sargent, now in San
Francisco, would present a report upon
the construction of an immigration sta
tion on Angel island, which would in
volve the expenditure of about $200,000.
Mr. Metcalf was averse to discussing
the work of his office, saying:
1 have come back to Oakland solely In order
to arrange my private business so that I can
move my family to Washington, for the pur
pose of carrying on the work of my depart
ment. My trip to Washington was a hurried
one, bo that I might consult with my prede
cessor. Secretary Cortelyou, and secure from
him some of the valuable information he had
acquired In organizing this new department.
Mr. Cortelyou's advice has-been of inestimable
benefit to me in taking up the details of a
department composed of many bureaus. I
will remain In Oakland for a short time, wind
up my private affairs, consult with a number
of those Interested In the advancement of the
Pacific Coast and then return to Washington.
OAKLAND, Aug. 22.â Victor H. Met
calf, the. latest addition to President
Roosevelt's Cabinet, returned to his
home to-day after having been installed
in his new position in Washington. He
came quietly to his Oakland home,
then went directly to his law office,
where he spent the entire day dealing
with private business and denying him
self to all save a few friends.
The new Secretary looked as if a
Cabinet officer's position were not all
play and as if he had been giving close
attention to the duties of his new office
in a season of trying weather. There
have been messages from Washington
from time to time to the effect that the
California Secretary was kept at his
desk early and late. A loss of weight
gives proof to the story. Mr. Metcalf
refused to discuss politics, and was re
luctant to discuss even the affairs of
his department. He said: '

As a result of the aggressive method
Inaugurated by the police in a cam
paign to close the Chinese lotteries in
this city, wagon-loads of confiscated
paraphernalia seized in Saturday
night's raid on Chinatown dens was
before Police Judge Smith this morn
ing under search warrant proceedings.
Not a claimant from the gambling
fciiupcs was on hand to demand return
of the badly mutilated benches, Btools,
brushes, pots and tickets that had been
<arted away froin the resorts along
Webster street. Testimony was given
by the police concerning the raids.
Judge Smith directed that all of the
Ftjlzed stuff should be destroyed. Among
the lot that was confiscated were 70,000
blank lottery tickets. These were
to-day, and the remainder of
ihe outfits was cast upon the prison
woodpile.
The Chinese lottery game had become
s"4>o!d In i:s operations in Oakland that
the gamblers were conducting their
l\\jc<?-a-day drawings in this city.
Many of the gamblers had cast loose
from the central resorts in San Fran
cisco and were running their games
here on their own account. This has
l.<*n under police knowledge for some
time. Ordinary methods had failed to
break up the games. Heretofore the
custom a^.d practice of the police have
been to make occasional raids on the
lottery games after detailing policemen
or other persons to collect evidence.
These raids have been spasmodic and
productive of no result other than the
collection of fines. They have accom
plished nothing in the direction of
checking the gamblers.
The police have determined that
there can be no permanent benefit
pained to the community by these per
functory raids. They have adopted the
rlan of smashing movements. Dens will
be wrecked as fast as they are located.
No favoritism is to b>e shown during
the warfare. Whether the gamblers lo
cate inside or outside of Chinatown,
they will be driven out by forcible ac
tion. Police posses armed with sledges
and axes will be detailed at intervals
to carry out the campaign. And every
precaution will be taken to prevent
leaks in the department, which in the
past have not unfrequently blocked po
lice attacks on gamblers, white as well
es Chinese. The records of the police
department show that not for many
months has anything approaching such
activity as has bÂ»=-en manifest in hand
ling the pamblers.
STUDENT'S DEATH DUE
TO HIS OVEREXERTIOX
BERKELEY, Aug. 22.â In the face of
the firm stand of the Board of Educa
tion in behalf of the State law the op
position to compulsory vaccination for
school children simmered away to al
most nothing to-day. Where a week
ago there were nearly 900 unvaccinated
pupils in the schools there were less
than 250 this morning and by to-mor
row the school authorities think that
there will be less than fifty pupils not
conforming to the law. What remains
of the opposition is composed of par
ents who have been bitterly opposed
to. vaccination from the standpoint of
health and from compulsory vaccina
tion from principle, the people who
were the leaders in the several mass
meetings called to protest against the
application of the law and the law
itself.
The decision of the School Board to
enforce the order of the State Board of
Health in regard to vaccination called
for summary action to-day, for on this
day the term of grace within which to
comply with the law expired. - Teach
ers were not permitted to accept as
pupils children not having vaccination
certificates. There was no attempt on
the part of parents to -insist upon the
acceptance of their children in the
schools and there was not a suggestion
of disturbance. At the close of school
hours 249 children had been excluded,
distributed among the following
schools:
High School 48, Commercial 2, Mc-
Kinley 25, Lincoln 24, Le Conte 33,
Longfellow 21. Whittier 24, Allston 2,
Hillside 22, Rose 10, San Pablo 15,
Columbus 8, Seventh 8, Grayson 4, and
Page 1.
These 249 pupils are not to be classed
as unvaccinated, however. In fact, a
larger number of those excluded are
vaccinated than not. A large number
were denied admittance because they
forgot to bring their vaccination certi
ficates and many were excluded for
various other reasons.
"I think that by to-morrow, f? said
S. D. Waterman, Superintendent of
Schools, this afternoon, "there will be
less than fifty children remaining out
of the schools on account of the vaccin
ation order. So many children were
turned away to-day because they did
not present their certificates showing
vaccination. Some "parents sent their
unvaccinated children to the schools
Just to see what we would do, but now
that they see that we mean business
they will probably submit to the law."
OAKLAND, Aug. 22. â The executive
committee of the Anti -Vaccination
League to-night decided to employ J.
R. Jones to bring mandamus proceed
ings against the Oakland Board of Ed
ucation to compel them to admit chil
dren withoht vaccination to the Oak
land schools. There will be a confer
ence with the Berkeley society Thurs
day, and it will be consulted about this
move.
Oakland Office SÂ£li Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Aug. 22.
The Hindoo in the County Jail here,
serving a six months' sentence under
the name of Julian Sternberg for petty
larceny, \-ho says he is a son of the
late Maharajah of Lahore, is a fraud
according to a letter received from the
Scotland Yard police station, London,
by Sheriff John N. Bishop to-day.
A letter of Inquiry /as sent to Eng
land last July by the Sheriff request
ing information as to the parentage of
the man claiming to be Prince Ramlna
Aramancha Sengh, and the following
letter has been received:
CRIMINAL, INVESTIGATION DEPART
MENT. NEW SCOTLAND YARD, LINCOLN,
S. \Y\, Aug. 6, ISO*.â To Sheriff John N.
Bishop. County of Alameda. Oakland, Cal.,
U. 8. A. â Sir: I have to acknowledge the re
ceipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo inclos
ing the photograph of Julian Sternberg who
claims to be Ramlna Aramancha Sengh, and
to acquaint you that the only legitimate sons
of the late Maharajah Duleep Sengh' are
Prince Victor and Prince Frederick.
The photograph of Julian Sternberg is cer
tainly not that of either of the aforenamed
princes and nothing Is known of any Illegiti
mate sons of the late Maharajah.
Every possible 'Inquiry has been made to
ascertain the antecedents of Sternberg, who
Is no doubt an Impostor, but up to the present
time nothing- has been traced. The photograph
you forwarded is herewith returned. I am,
sir, your obedient servant,
M. T. MACRAGHTER.
The letter did not seem to disturb
Sengh. He says his origin and birth
have nothing to do with the trouble
he is in and that he was satisfied in his
own mind and cared little what any
one else thought. He said the late
Maharajah recognised him and kept
him with him in Paris for several
years.' Sengh stole $65 from a ' fore
man of "Chris" Buckley at his coun
try home at Ravenswood, near Liver

That Running for Train Caused
Heart Failure.
'OAKLAND. Aug. 22.â An autopsy on
the body of O?car Smith, who died on
a* Santa Fe train â¢ leaving Richmond
last night, developed the fact that
death was due to heart failure, caused
by overexertion in running to- catch a
train. ''ââ¢ Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦
Smith was a student at the Univer
sity of California, having entered the
freshman claps of this year.
' He had been spending the day at
Point Richmond. He was dead when
Conductor H. C. Sullivan passed
through the tr,ain to collect tickets.
Hullivan thought the young man was
KFleep, but on shaking him discovered
no sign of life. The body was taken
to Oakland and delivered to the Cor
oner. An inquest was held this morn
ing.
.The young man was a son of Seth
Fmith, County Surveyor of Tulare
County, resident at Visalia. He was
a brother of Le Hoy Smith, the famous
university yell leader. Since going to
Befkeley Smith had made his home

Z. J. Witten, an undertaker from Vi
calia, was literally kicked out of the
Coroner's office to-night by Coroner H.
B. Mehrmann and then arrested on the
Coroner's complaint and charged with
disturbing the peace. Witten was re
leased on 525 bail. The undertaker went
to the Morgue to claim property be-
Jonging to young Smith, which the Cor
oner had turned over to a cousin of
the dead student. Witten became so
obstreperous, according to the Coron
er, that violent metlfods were pursued
in ejecting him.

Harry McKay, After Two Experiences
With Thieves in San Francisco,
Causes an Arrest.
OAKLAND, Aug. 22. â Harry Mc-
Kay, residing at 960 Peralta street,
who claims he was robbed twice yes
terday in San Francisco, losing $10 in
a water front saloon and $160 in a
Fourth-street lodging-house, over
hauled one of the men he charges with
the crime late last night in Oakland.
McKay spied .Thomas Scott at Fifth
street and Broadway and told Patrol
man W. I. 'Hodgklns that Scott had
stolen the $10 from him. The police
man made after Scott, who ran, but
was captured at Seventh and Webster
streets. He was detained at the City
Prison.
Scott is known* as Thomas iTurphy.
It is charged he was one of two men
whom McKay invited to drink with
him and requited the hospitality by
grabbing the money after one of the
pair had pinioned arms. After
that experience the wayfarer from
Oakland was looking for sympathy.
One Harry Fox gave him lots of it
and suggested he would be in good
company by going to a Fourth-street
lodging-house with his new found
friend. Fox, it is claimed, stole the
$160 and disappeared. Scott will be
sent to San Francisco for trial.- â¢Â¦

The blues and the browns were again
the combatants. The blue army, based
on Port Harford, was acting on the
defensive against the brown army,
based on Salinas. A blue force had
been ordered to defend Atascadero sta
tion, -which place had been intrenched
against a brown force coming from the
direction of Asuncion. The plan of the
browns, under command of Colonel W.
L. Pitcher, was to divide his forces into
two jÂ»arts, force number one to take a
circuitous route by the Henry ranch,
and force number two to march under
cover of the hills about 300 yards from
Atascadero Creek.
Here Major Van Vliet and his bat
talion was detached and sent as a fly
ing column toward Atascadero station
to make an attack on the blues' strong
hold at Pine Mountain. The remaining
two battalions at this point made a
dash for Atascadero Creek and from
there made two assaults upon the in
trenched blues. ,
At 11:20 a. m. a consultation of the
umpires took place. Major S. E. Allen
and Captain B. II. Wells of the blues
and Captain T. M. Helms and Captain
Manus McCloskey of the browns, and
they rendered a decision for the blues,
the browns being declared driven back
to the creek bed, with a loss of one
third of their force.
To-morrow afternoon all the troops
here will participate in regimental, bat

at 3 o'clock-
On Thursday morning at 8 o'clock

General MacArthur leaves at 6 o'clock
to-morrow morning for a tour to the
seaports immediately adjacent to San
Luis Obispo and this camp. He will be
accompanied by Colonel P. Jocelyn,
Major C. E. Gillette, Major G. O.

Captain F. L. Winn. For the trip they
will use the Signal Corps automobile

A special meeting of the Board ol
Supervisors was called yesterday for
Wednesday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock to
consider two monster petitions signed
by more than 12,000 electors in each
case for the submission of charter
amendments affecting municipal em
ployes. The number of signatures to
each petition is largely in excess of the
15 per cent of the voters required Â»by
the charter.
One of the proposed amendments pro
vides for a half holiday on every Sat
urdaj* for all employes of the city gov
ernment and for fourteen days' vaca
tion in each calendar year with pay.
The amendments further provide that
in case the duties of a municipal em
ploye are such that he has to work all
day Saturday .then he is to be given a
half holiday on some other day in the
week.
The other amendment provides for an
increase in the salary of engineers of
the Fire Department to $16S0 yearly.
Th Board of Supervisors has already
decided to submit an amendment in
creasing the salaries of certain mem
bers of the Fire Department, including
that of engineers, to $1470 yearly. The
engineers went ahead on their own
account and under the charter their^
amendment will also be submitted to
the voters.
Supervisor Eggers presided at the
board's meeting, which adjourned until
to-morrow, without transacting any
business. Only five Supervisorsâ Booth,
Connor, Eggers, Finn and Hocks â
were present.
STEALS A MARCH ON
THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTY
The Sheriff's deputies who attempted
yesterday morning to serve an attach
ment on the jewels, coin and stock cer
tificates of Miss Lena S. Walton,
known as the Hetty Green of Nome,
were outwitted, and Miss Walton is
now on her way East. She says she
was warned by mental telepathy that
the attaches of the Sheriff's office, at
the instance of Max Gutter, a mining
man, intended to make service of a
writ of attachment for $6000. Acting
on the mental warning she arose early,
shipped her belongings beyond the
reach of San Francisco's Sheriff and
awaited developments.
Miss Walton was not disappointed.
While she was at breakfast in the Lick
House a deputy sheriff arrived with
the expected writ of attachment, but
found to his chagrin that there wa3
nothing left to attach.
. Her preliminary hearing on a charge
of obtaining money by false pretenses
is set for November 15. Gutter charges
that she sold him interests in claims
which she did not own. ' She says she
will be back to answer the charge and
also promises to make it warm for her
accuser.

President Rohcovieri of the Board of
Education declared yesterday that one
section of the proposed charter amend
ment now being prepared to make the
School Department independent of the
Board of Supervisors in the fixing of
its budget expenditures will /provide
that the last named body shall have
power to make cuts in the appropria
tions by specific items only and must
give good reasons for so doing. This
is designed to correct the existing cus
tcm of the Supervisors to reduce the
appropriations requested by the Board
of Education by a lump sum.
What prompted Roncovi^ri to insert
this proviso in the amendment was the
fact that last May the Board of Edu
cation made a request for money to in
stall fire escapes in the schoolhouses
in compliance with the law, which
makes such installation mandatory.
The Supervisors did not cut out this
item, but, by reducing the total
amount asked for, so crippled the de
partment that no fire escapes can be
purchased, as the law requires.
Another proviso of the proposed
amendments is the limitation of the
annual amount to be expended for
schools. It was at first proposed to
limit the tax rate for the purpose,
but the same end will be accomplished
by some other, method noC yet made
public. Roncovieri says the amend
ments have been submitted to compe
tent attorneys, all of whom are agreed
on their legality. They will be finally
submitted to Garret McEnerney for
his opinion.
Roncovieri is very much purturbed
over a remark attributed to Super
visor Braunhart that the Board of Su
pervisors will not allow the money aci
quired under the bonds for new school
houses to be used during the Schmitz
administration. About $1,000,000 will
be available in about six months and
Roncovieri claims that the Supervisors
have no right to delay its use merely
for political effect.
Roncovieri yesterday received the
plans of new schoolhouses erected in
New York prepared by Architect C. B.
Snyder. The most important fs the
Morris High School building, which
cost $600,000 and Is a model school
building in every respect.

LITIGATION AT AN END
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â It has just
developed that Albert T. Patrick, the
lawyer who is in Sing Sing Prison un
der sentence of death in the William
Marsh Rice case, but who now has an
appeal pending, recently aided a fellow
prisoner in securing a temporary stay
which has served to prolong his life.
Patrick took up the affairs of Michael
Brusch, convicted of having killed Po
liceman Enright, who, it was claimed,
caught Brusch in the act of committing
a burglary in Harlem last, March.
Brusch's lawyers refused to appeal
from the verdict of murder and their
client was sentenced to die in the elec
tric chair. The prisoner soon began to
explain his affairs to the other pris
oners and Patrick finally took them in
hand. He dictated a notice of appeal
which Brusch mailed to the District
Attorney's office as well as to the
court. This acted as a stay against
the execution of sentence, but the ap
peal shortly comes up for argument
and whether Patrick will be permitted
to appear as counsel is doubtful.

FORT RILEY, Kan., Aug. 22.â The
first day's firing in the team of the
national match was completed at 5:20
to-day, with the army infantry team in
the lead. The day was ideal in every
respect. The heavy shower of thfÂ»
preceding day cleared the atmosphere
and a low wind made it remarkably
cool. Firing commenced at 7:45, with
New York credited with firing first.
To-day's programme, firing at four
ranges, was the longest of the match,
eo shooting was only discontinued at
noon long enough for all to be served
with a light lunch, which was served
at the firing points. Major General
John C." Bates, commanding the North
ern Division, who arrived this after
noon, went directly to the range and
lemained until all the firing was com
pleted. He visited every team and in
spected their scores.
The shooting to-day was at 200 and
â¬00 yards, slow fire, and 200 and 500
yards, rapid fire. The following is the
standing of the teams representing the
different States, with their scores out
of a possible 2400:

No sooner had the Supreme Court of California de
clared the legality of our bond issue than bankers in
London, New York and Chicago made application to
purchase large quantities of the securities. While these
financiers cannot know as well as we the stability of San

This correspondent wants to know
where there Is to be found the quota
tion which has been accredited to Lin
coln and to Horace Greeley. namely.
"Tou can fool some of the people all the
time, you can fool all the people some
of the time, but you cannot fool all the

Mexican Dollar Passing.
The decline and fall in the circulation
of what was once an almost universal
coinâ the Mexican silver dollar â Is de
scribed in a recent issue of the Harvard
Quarterly Journal of Economics by!
Professor A. Piatt Andrew. The causes
of the world-wide circulation of this
coin He in the fact that for many gen
erations Mexico was the great silver
producer of the world. From the dis
covery of this continent down to 1S50
80 per cent of the world's supply of the
white metal came from the mines of
Mexico and Spanish America. This coin
also had the good fortune to escape
debasement almost entirely. Between
1497 and our own days its metallic con
tent declined less than 6 per centâ an
almost unique fact In monetary his
tory. The approaching extinction of
this dollar as a medium of Interna
tional use has been due to the enlarged
output of silver and Its demonetization
in the gold-using world. In Japan the
Mexican dollar has been driven out. In
the Philippines the new American silver
peso (redeemable in gold and therefor*
non-exportable) Is rapidly supplanting
the Mexican dollar. The situation la
very similar in Porto Rico. It looks aa

Joseph I. Brittain, American Consul at Kehl, Ger
many, has some timely advice to give California fruit
shippers upon the present status of the German market
for California fruit. According to his statement the out
look for our product in Germany is . growing brighter
with each season, but great caution on the part of the

Especially does Consul Brittain urge upon : the notice
of California fruit packers the advisability of disposing
of their stock directly through German agents, whose
establishments in the largest cities there give them op
portunity to keep a delicate finger upon the pulse of

for the disposition of the goods. As a result of this
policy, already adopted by some of the leading fruit

Consul, a market double the former proportions in

"Captain Urquehart says the ship's

Erna Leontine Elvira Bellachini was
born In 1S60. and her father, a Jew,
whose real name was Bellach, was one
of the most popular magicians ever
scon on the Continental stage. At 16
>iars of ajje Erna became a chorus
pirl In the old Victoria Theater in Ber
lin. Two years later she made her first
matrimonial venture, marrying in Ber
lin a wealthy wine merchant, whose
property she immediately began to
squander. Later her husband secured
a divorce. ,
Then she became acquainted with the
well-known Countess Fisi Seydewitz.
who introduced her under the name of
Madame de Behair at one of the small
German courts. Here she met a gay
cavalry officer. Lieutenant Baron Lut
zow. who after a short acquaintance
married her in Heligoland. The Bar
oness seemed quite incapable of re
maining in love with any person long
together, and soon began a desperate
flirtation with a dashing dragoon of
ficer, whose acquaintance she made in
a characteristic way. Seeing the officer
k|. preaching her In a public square she
Â¦was seized with a convenient fainting
fit and contrived to fall into his arms.
The dragoon speedily became a victim
to her wiles, and the news of their inti
macy reaching her husband divorce
proceedings followed.
The dragoon became her third hus
band, the ceremony this time taking
place at Naples. This union proved no
more lasting than the previous two, the
lady finding other lovers, and as a re
sult the dragoon Invoked the aid of the
law courts and the lady was for the
third time divorced.
But Ehe was a persevering individual,
and before very long captured another
officer, who married her ia London.
During her brief union with her fourth
husband she was arrested upon a
charge of swindling: and held in cus
tody for four weeks, b?lng finally dis
charged only on account of Insufficient
evidence. Her husband found she was
indulging In love affairs, too, and In his
turn sought and obtained a divorce.
For the next few years Frau von
Hervay led a wandering life. She called
herself the Baroness de Shane, and
with the greatest audacity declared
that ehe was the daughter of the Grand
Duchess Vladimir, the aunt of the pres
ent Czar and mother of the Grand
Duke Boris, who recently traveled
across the American continent and con
tributed his mite to the gayety of Chi

a Russian Grand Duchess. Her dresses
were magnificent and her display of
pearls and diamonds extraordinarily
opulent.. but they have since proved to
be false. She gave herself out as enor
mously wealthy, having large sums of
money deposited In Vienna banks. The
unfortunate Captain von Hervay doubt,
less imagined he was getting a rich
prize. His friends, however, were skep
tical and began instituting Inquiries as
to her wealth.
Soon the final exposure came, and the
deluded Governor, realizing the extent
of his misery, took his life.
Frau von Hervay is In prison charged

WHEN now the world is prone to congratulate
itself upon being a better place to live in than it
has ever been and when philanthropists arc
po-nting out the savage, clothed, and the benighted, pro
vided with pocket Bibles, contented worldlings have little
ear for the grim stories that have been drifting out of
the heart of Africa. But with the special Congo supple
ment of the West African Mail, which has just found its
waj' into Europe and this country, there comes confirma
tion of shocking tales of barbarity, the like of which the
nations have not heard since the last Arab slaver was
forced to go into retirement.
This sheet, together with an appeal from the Congo
Ktform Association for the betterment of the condition
of native women and children in that state, recites
stories of outrages perpetrated with the connivance of
King Leopold's Government which could hardly be
credited were they not accompanied by the signed testi
mony of the informers. The tale is told of women, some
about to become mothers, herded into chain gangs and
marched over wearisome stretches to the central settle
ments of the 'chartered companies, of men and boys
mutilated because the quota of rubber due the company
was not forthcoming, of girls tortured for the intimida
tion of their husbands and brothers. These barbarities
are done by the native soldiery at the orders of the di
rectors of the concession companies.
When first the world began to be startled by the stories
of this, like that which drifted out of the heart of the
Dark Continent, it was treated to a gratuitous exhibition
of injured innocence by King Leopold. Never, accord
ing to that astute monarch, was there a state so favored
in its government as is the Congo Free State; soulful
philanthropy had been the dictator of all his actions
toward this trust awarded him by the powers signatories
of the Berlin act. He, King Leopold, was pained that
there should be any doubts concerning his strictly
honorable dealings. Thus did the tale of the Belgian
monarch's protestations run.
Now, however, we are given in this West African Mail
supplement the details of a trial recently held at the
Appeal Cour, v of Boma whereat a Belgian employe of
one of the concessionary companies was made to stand
for willful slaughter of the natives in one of the jungle
towns. The testimony developed the fact that of the
capitalization of the company in question, amounting to
1,700,000 francs, the state had a half interest; that on
every ton of rubber, of wax or of copal collected in the
company's factories the Government levied heavy toll.
The evidence was further adduced that because the
natives of a certain district failed to furnish their labor
or their products to this company, in which the state was
a half owner, company "gunmen," together with regular
state soldiery and officered by state commissioned offi
cers, deliberately carried on a three months' campaign
against the recalcitrant natives within the borders of the
Congo Free State.
When the findings of one of Congo's courts reveals
conditions such as this and further takes cognizance of
the fact'that it is not a case unique in the stairs of the
stite, it is time for the powers thai gave the country
into Leopold's keeping to call for a record of his stew
ardship. Here is a state of affairs on par with that
against which the nations united in the old days of
African west coast slavery.

At a reception that was tendered h!m

"A week or two afterward, passing

came a prominent figure in local so
ciety. The men raved about her, but
the women were suspicious and specu
lated much as to her true antecedents.
From the outset the Governor showed
a lively interest in her and it was not
long before they were betrothed. The
marriage was a brilliant affair and
among the distinguished guests pres
ent was the Austrian Minister of Edu
cation, in whose bureau Von Hervay
had begun his official career.
At first all went well, although local
gossip continued. Curiosity aa to the
wife's past history increased and one
day a local paper published a short
fiction 6tory which was clearly intend
ed for Frau von Hervay. The heroine
was said to have been a swindler, who
had had four or flve husbands. The
Governor read it and was seised with a
horrible dread. He called his wife
into his private office and after a long
interview they parted. The lady left
Murzzusehlag. Then came news from
Vienna of her having been found un
; conscious in one of the principal
NEXT to Hongkong, which is British territory,
the greatest seaport on the Chinese coast is
Shanghai. It is Chinese territory, under the juris
diction of that empire. It is therefore within that "admin
istrative entity" of' China which Secretary Hay declared
at the beginning of the war must be respected by both
belligerents. When the Port Arthur fleet quit fighting
and ran to cover, the cruiser Askold and a gunboat ran
into Shanghai. The Chinese officers ordered them to
leave within the neutral limit of twenty-four hours, or
else disarm, and stay there until the end of the war.
They entered on the 12th of August and were there yet
on the 21st. Not only did they refuse to respect Chi
nese neutrality by leaving, but they proceeded to make
Shanghai a Russial naval base by repairing, refitting,
coaling and making other preparations to equip them to
go out at a favorable opportunity and resume fighting.
China has no power to enforce the order to leave of
to protect her own neutrality. Under such circum
stances it is the undoubted right of Japan to send her
fleet ir and destroy ot capture the two^ Russian ships.
But here another question of importance intervenes.
The harbor is full of merchant ships belonging to many
neutral nations, and their nationals have vast property
on the docks and in the godowns which would be im
periled if a naval battle occur in the harbor. In this
emergency Admiral Sterling, with eight American war
ships, sailed into the harbor to prevent a conflict that
would destroy American and other neutral property.
He followed a Japanese torpedo-boat and placed an
American gunboat between her and the Russian ships.
This was an act of discretion on his part, without orders
from Washington, but was in accordance with the
policy of his Government.
iie is reinforced by warships of Great Britain; France
and Germany, and the world's interest in the siege of
Port Arthur is almost entirely diverted to the exciting
situation at Shanghai. There is reason for believing
that the Foreign Consuls there, led by Mr. Goodnow,
our Consul General, have demanded that the Russian
ships immediately disarm or leave the port. But the
Russian Consul General, with all the shifty character
istics of his Government, refuses to disarm the ships
or send them out of port. The Japanese fleet lies out
sidt the three-mile limit, ready to take them in as soon
as they appear. Admiral Sterling has offered to escort
them out to. their fate, but they refuse to go. The end
may come before this is printed and can be reached in
only one of two ways; the ships must disarm or leave
the port. The United States will submit to no other
solution, and the other nations will follow our lead.
It brings sharply in issue the question of Chinese neu
trality. China has no navy that can protect her neutral
position. The great foresight of Secretary Hay is
shown in his procuring the agreement of the nations
that Chinese neutrality must be respected. Russia re
fusing to do Â«o puts first upon us and then upon all the
acceptors of Secretary Hay's note the duty of doing what
China cannot do. If Secretary Hay had not foreseen
events at this moment every Chinese port would be a
Russian naval base. Russia has earned punishment for
her conduct at and near Chefoo. Chefoo faces Port
Arthur and near there, on Chinese ground, Russia has
a wireless telegraph station by which to communicate
with Port Arthur.
That is a violation of neutral rights. She also per
sisted in using Chefoo as a naval base until the Japa
nese, in clear exercise of their rights, went in and cap
tured a Russian warship. The importance of the mat
ter appears when the prospective plight of the Baltic
squadron is considered. That fleet is supposed to be
on its way to the scene M the conflict. When it arrives
it will find it impossible .*o enter a Russian port. Port
Arthur will probably be m possession of the Japanese
and Vladivostok will be isolated. There will be no
coaling station or harbor of refuge available, and the
fleet will go the way of destruction and capture taken
by its predecessors.
If, however, the nations permit such violation of
Chinese neutrality as Russia attempts at Shanghai, China
simply becomes a military convenience for the use and
service of Russia. If the Russian Consul continue his
refusal to disarm his ships or send them out of the har
bor it will be entirely within his duty for Admiral Ster
ling to order them out or disarm them if they refuse to
go. If they resist him and show fight, it means that to
protect American property he, being at close quarters,
can torpedo and sink them both. Whatever his duty
is, within the limits of international law, public senti
ment at home will applau 1 his fearless performance of
it. Our commerce has already suffered a loss of mil
lions by Russia's attempt to make the law of the sea,
and our people will have no patience with her attempt
to rewrite the rules of neutrality by violating them when
it is her interest to do so. ,'â¢ "Â¦
Japan is not only waiting outside of Shanghai for the
Askold and her consort, but is picking off every Russian
man-of-war she finds afloat. The destruction of the
Novik, while she was attempting a sneak to Vladivostok,
has in it a certain satisfaction for Californians. The
Japanese cruiser- Chitose, which took part in that ac
tion, vita Prince Yorihito second in command, was built
here at the Union Iron Works. She has proved a
stanch ship and a good fighter.
Starting Something.
The recent resignation from the
police force of George Brown, better
known as "Shanghai." brings back to
memory stories of pranks which the
former officer was wont to play on any
one at any time In any old place.
Brown was connected with the Har
bor Police station several years ago.
Business was dull and the bluecoat
longed for excitement. There was a
character known as "British Bill." who
made a living by running a sailor
boarding-house and supplying a. b. s.
for deep water skimmer whenever the
opportunity offered.
Brown went to two colored white
washers and engaged them to white
wash Bill's domicile. "I have a little
shack down on the Water front," he
told them. "Go down there to-morrow
morning and give the dump a clean
coat. You'll find an old bloke sitting
around the rooms. If he says anything
ordinary care in the preparation and forwarding of their
Output. Not long ago there came complaints from
France relative to fraudulent labels attached to much of
the dried prune shipments received there. Under the
title of Santa Clara prunes there was being shipped into
the French markets a distinctively inferior brand which
sold at the same price as that of the genuine. Not only
does this deception weaken the genuine Santa Clara
stock abroad, but it casts descredit upon the whole ex
port. A continuance of this practice would be fatal to
the trade in California evaporated fruit now building
abroad.
Another and more .serious danger threatens the future
of our fruit in German markets. Consul Brittain in
corporates in his report a clipping from a Strassburg
journal to the effect that on account of harmful ingredi
ents used in the curing of fruits the California import
was to be forbidden. It is alleged in the article that an
alum bath and glycerine application to the prunes made
them unfit for food, and that in the matter of peaches
and apricots such a strong preparation of sulphur was
used to preserve the appearance of the fruit that :i
residuum of sulphuric acid made the finished product
positively dangerous.
Though this allegation of the Strassburg organ has
nothing official about it and there has been no move on
the part of the .Government at Berlin to bar California
fruits on account of impurities found therein, the pro
ducers of this State should take notice of these charges.
If they are unfounded measures should be taken to cor
rect the German misconception. If they .are founded
upon a truth the remedy lies here at home and should be
p.pplied at once before the prestige Of our dried fruits
in forign markets is allowed tn wane.

E. W. Darling, the self-styled
"nachur-man," was arrested yester
day afternoon by Policeman Robert
Connor for violating section 311 of the
Penal Code, which refers to the utter
ing: and distributing of obscene
literature. Last night the "freak
man" slept in the jail and not out
"dorz," as he advocates people should
do In his literature.
Darling:, who makes his livelihood
from the selling: of cards containing:
writings of his own, the words spelled
in an insane way, was distributing his
cards at the time of his arrest.
The "nachur-man" did not feed on
nuts and fruits, the prison-keepers
thrusting toward him black coffee and
a pan of mush for his . supper. He
seemed to take his incarceration
placidly. He will appear in court this
morning:. â¢> >.^

OAKLAND, Â«Vug. 22. â "I wish the
fight vu set for to-night Instead of
Friday night, for the way I feel now
X could fight like a fiend," said Cham
pion James J. Jeffries this morning,
after nearly two hours of hard work
is the Reliance Club gymnasium.
The big fellow's appearance bore out
Ills words, for, although dripping with
perspiration, the champion did n3t
draw a long breath, nor in any way
chow that he felt the effect of his ex
ercise.
A big crowd of local sports appeared
at the club this morning in the hope
of seeing Jeffries don the gloves, but he
did no boxing, confining his work to
the gymnasium In the morning and
going for a run in the afternoon. He
finished the day by rowing a heavy
boat on Lake Merritt for more than
an hour.
The bJg champion apparently gives
no thought to the approaching contest,
for during the time he spent in the
"gym" this morning he was full of fun,
end talked of everything except the
fight.
"Maybe you think this cool weather
don't feel pood after the heat up at
Harbin," said Jeff. "Why. I could keep
at work all day and then never know
1 had been doSne anything. I've been
et It for mors than an hour now, and
I'm Just beginning to get warmed up."
With these words the champion
Jumped up and started after Eugene
Van Court, chasing him around the
Frymnasium until Van picked up a club
p.nd turned to do battle. "Oh, well, if
that's the way you feel about it,""
growled the champion, "I'll take it out
of something that won't fight back."
End with this he went at the punching
bat
This finished the morning's work and,
after a ehower and a rubdown, Jeffries
tock it easy until 4 o'clock, when he
started out on the road, accompanied
by Van Court, who rode a bicycle. He
went around Lake Merritt by way of
thÂ«Â» cemetery and Pleasant Valley road
and came bark along the Scenic boule
vard. After his run he got the heaviest
boat he could find and rowed around
the lake. A sprint to the club and a
rubdown completed the day's work, and
Jeff Joined his wife at the hotel and
went to the Gas Kitchen for supper.
Billy Delaney Is letting the cham
pion work about as he pleases, but he
BÂ£id to-n$gt:t that Jeff would do some
boxing: to-morrow morning. As Jeff
offered no objection, it is probable that
Brother Jack and Joe Kennedy will
c itch it in the morning.

SANTA BARBARA. Aug. 22.â In one
of the fiercest and most hotly contested
polo games ever played on the Baclfic
Coast, and one which will go down as
the most sensational in the history of
the game here, the Santa Barbara polo
team defeated the crack Burlingame
four this afternoon by a score of 5 to
L Fully 2000 persons witnessed the
game and went wild when the gong
sounded in the last period, closing the
game with a one-sided score.
"It was one of the fastest and most
cleanly played games I ever saw or
took part in in my whole polo experi
ence," said J. O. Tobin, the crack Bur
lingame player, after the game, "and I
want to say right here that we were
fairly and squarely outplayed in almost
every point of the game. Santa Bar
bara played some of the best team
work I ever saw and the individual
play of the men was also very bril
liant."
The field this afternoon presented a
sight that will be remembered for
many a day. Smart traps, automo
biles and every other form of convey
ance surrounded the field on the west
side, north and southeast sides, and the
commodious grand stand was filled to
overflowing with interested spectators.
The teams faced each other as follows:
Santa Barbaraâ J. I* Colby, No. 1; R.
C. Rogers, No. 2; E. A. Boeseke, No. 3;
Dr. E. J. Boeseke, back.
Burlingameâ R. M. Tobln, No. '1;
Cyril Tobin, No. 2: T. A. Driscoll, No.
3; J. O. Tobin, back.
Santa Barbara won the toss and
chose to defend the upper goal. Right
at the start it was apparent that both
teams were out for the hardest game
ever seen on the local field and that
the, players had forgotten their per
sonality entirely in order to get the
best results as a team. "Whenever a
ball was lined out for a run a white
man and a blue could be seen going
down the field together, the team work
of both clubs being almost perfect.
Burlingame took a brace and in the
last part of the first period things
looked very blue for the home team.
During the first half of the game
the sky had . taken on a threatening
aspect and several drops of rain had
fallen and when the teams lined up
for the third quarter it was raining
hard. This period proved Burlingame's
Waterloo, for Santa Barbara started
to force matters from the first. After
some hot work around the goal Colby
finally sent the ball through. Score:
Santa Barbara, 2; Burlingame, 0.
The locals certainly had their scoring
clothes on at this period. Dr. Boeseke
and E. A. Boeseke contributing to the
grand total in the order named.

To-day Jack Munroe will don the

two rounds with Kid McCoy for prac

Kid McCoy wig-wagged' "go it" and
the miner batted Foley all around the

Harry Chester was the next victim.
When Munroe came at him he longed
for a cyclone or something gentle. Mr.

remembering that a long rest was due,
finished strong. Andy was groggy

This morning Jack will go it a little

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 22,â A rather
light card was put forward for the
opening of the State Fair. race meeting
to-day, the only event approaching
class being the Occident stake for
three-year-old trotters, which devel
oped into a contest that delighted the
admirers of harness racing. It took
seven heats to decide the stake, the
heavy end of which went to W. G.
Durfee's Almaden, which took the
last three heats after the others liad
come back to his notch.* It was a
bruising race with heats badly split
between Marvin Wilkes. the favorite,
Carlokin and the winner.
The second race, a trot for the 2:30
class, went to Morosco, the favorite. In
three heats, after the Judges had fined
Cabney, his driver, *50 for not trying
to win the first heat. All pools sold in
the mutuel boxes on this heat were
declared off.
Royal Dame, a local mare, was an
added starter in this race, but was
withdrawn after the first heat, as was
Monocrat. The gallopers were an in
different lot and the racing they pro
vided was not exciting. The track
looked hard and fast, but no fast time
was made.
A hot tip was sent out on Zenobia
for the third race, but North Pole,
a horse which raced well at Seattle,
ran over his field and the much-touted
Zenobia was necked out for the place
by Tuck Back.
Celeres was played to win the flve
furlong spin for two-year-olds and
would have made good had he got off
well. He was practically left. at the
post, but showed a great burst of
speed, running to the show. Edge
cliffe, the favorite, beat the barrier
and was never headed, beating Gos
slper, which had been second all the
route, by half a length. Skirmish won
the final event, a selling affair, at six
furlongs. She got off well and made
her run through the stretch, winning
handily, Berendos beating Potentla for
the place, by a narrow margin.
. What little betting was dons to-day
was confined to the auction and mu
tuel pool boxes, the State Fair direc
tors having determined to bar ths
bookmakers this year. Of late years
It has been impossible to make an
open ring and the syndicate book has
had full sway. So general was the
complaint against the syndicate by
reason of the "tight" book made that
the directors decided to experiment
with auction and mutuel pools, after
the method of many years ago.
The light play to-day and the small
returns to the directors on percentage
may Induce them to put the books on
under some arrangement with Chase
& Co., who have the pooling privilege.
The pavilion opened to-night with
a ribbon parade given In the horse
show oval by the Sacramento Driving

SARATOGA, Aug. 22.â Messrs. John
W. Gates and John A. Drake differed
in their opinions to-day as to which
was the better horse in the Amsterdam
Selling stake and the outcome appeared
to indicate Gates' judgment to be the
better, as his selection, De Reszke,
won, while Drake's colt, Bobadjl. which
he thought would win, ran second â
but so strong a second that many con
sidered him the better horse when they
saw how "poorly Bobadil got away aa
compared with De Reszke.
The Amsterdam stake was a hard
fought contest in its early stages. Old
England being the pacemaker at the
end of four and a half furlongs, after
which he fell out of it, partly due to
some interference, which also forced
GBy Boy's rider, O'Neill, to take him out
wide to escape the trouble. Virgin Soil
led into the stretch and appeared to
have an excellent chance at one time,
but, being on the inside, where the
going was heavier than on other parts
of the course, she was beaten at the
last furlong pole. This filly won the
Amsterdam Selling stake last year.

CHICAGO, Aug. 22.â The Test stakes
at five and a half furlongs for two
year-olds was the feature of the card
at Hawthorne to-day. Speculation was
evenly divided between Flaxman and
Ram's Horn, the former finally closing
a slight favorite. To a perfect start
the two favorites raced like a team to
the head of the stretch, where Flax
man showed his head in front, with
No Trumper a like distance in front of
Ram's Horn. In a desperate drive of
the three, they remained in this order
to the wire, each slightly ' increasing
his lead over the next horse.
Jockey Henry landed two winners for
Corrigan to-day] Besides winning with
Orfeo in the first race, he also landed
Sweetie in the third, after riding a per
fect race on the filly.
Ttte track was heavy, the weather
clear and cool and a good Monday

I was afflicted with Tetter In bad shape.
It would appear in blotches as large as my
hand, a yellowish color, and scale off.
You can imagine how offensive it was.
For twelve years I was afflicted with this
trouble. At night it was a case of scratch
and many times no rest at all. Seeing the
good the medicine was doing a fnend
who was taking it for Eczema, I com-
menced it, and as a result the eruption be-
gan to dry up and disappear, and to-day
1^ am practically a well man. Only two
tiny spots are left on the elbow and shin,
where once the whole body .was affected.
I have every confidence in the medicine,
and feel sure that in a short time these
two remaining spots will disappear.
S. S. S. is certainly a great blood puri-
fier, and has done me a world of good.
I am grateful for what it has accom-
plished, and trust that what I have said
will lead others who are similarly afflict-
ed to take the remedy and obtain the
same good results that I have.

Fred Glocker, car starter,- who for many
years has been stationed at the curve around
which the Sacramento street cars sweep into
Market street, distinguished himself Sunday
morning by an act of bravery which undoubt
edly saved many of the passengers who crowd
ed a Hayea street car from serious Injury and
possibly death. That the curve at which
Glocker Is stationed has not been the scene
of many serious accidents is due to the start
er's cool head and strict attention to duty.
He had 'just halted a car Hunday morning
when the horses pulling the Golden West Hotel
bus took fright and headed on a mad gallop
for a crowded Hayes street car Just pulling
out from the turntable. The danger to the
people on the car wax apparent and several

euffrable loss.
The raclfic Mail and Occidental and i Ori
ental Steamship companies yesterday issued
notice that after the departure of the liner
Mcnchuria freight would be received from all
shippers for Japanese and Korean ports. Only
a few favored ones were allowed to send cargo
on the Manchuria, but the Siberia, which sails
Auguet 30, will take freight from anybody.
The palling of the Pacific Mail Company's
liner Manchuria has been postponed until
Thursday at 1 o'clock. The reason for the
ctlay is the Inability of General Manager
Schwerln to get permission" from 'Washington
for the transfer to the Manchuria of the
Chinese crew brought from the Orient on the
Siberia.
The Manchuria will not call at Honolulu.
Krom here she goes direct to Yokohama. Of
her 12.0CO toes of cargo more than half is for
Japan, and most of the Japanese freight is
lcr the use of the Mikado's forces on land
and sea. . Â¦

Scliussler Talks on Water.
The New York goes back to the
North Atlantic' station. The Chicago
is on her way here to take the place
of the New York. The vessels will
meet at Valparaiso, it is expected, and
there Admiral Goodrich will haul down
his flag and transfer himself, his flag,
his staff and his belongings to the
Chicago, which will come to San Fran
cisco and remain on this station as the
flagship of the squadron.
For the first time In some months
San Francisco harbor has its man-of
war row. Since the departure of the
Pacific squadron for Panama only an
occasional and lone cruiser, gunboat or
destroyer has anchored in the bay and
even those visits have been brief, few
and far between. Yesterday, how
ever, the flagship New York, with Ad
miral Goodrich on . board, and com
manded by Captain Hunker; the
cruiser Marblehead," Captain Thomas,
and the gunboat Benning^on, Captain
Phelpe, came in stately procession
through the Golden Gate and dropped
their mud hooks at the anchorages
they left last year.
The New York is swinging to her
steel cable off Clay street wharf, and
off Folsom street, in. the anchorage
ground sacred for many years to ves
sels of the navy, are tethered the
Marblehead and Bennington, in com
pany with the Solace and Boston and
a fleet of laid up army transports.
Captain Hunker said yesterday that
no orders had been received regarding
the movements of the squadron. Offi
cers and men hope to remain at this
port until after the Knights Templar
Conclave, but unless orders to that ef
fect are received the New York, Ben
nington, Marblehead and Boston will
start south in a few days.

The Boaid of Public Works respectfully re
quests that paid sum of $1916 36 be set asld
from the urgent necessity fund for the fiscal
year 1904-1905 with which to meet the ex
perse of reconstructing paid pavement.
In accordance with its- custom in
augurated since a court decision was
handed down nearly a year ago that
the Commissioners of Public Works are
personally liable for any injuries which
may be sustained through defective
sidewalks, the Board of Public Works
yesterday, served notices on several
property owners that they must put
down new sidewalks at certain desig
nated locations or have the old ones
barricaded.- These notices have been
found effective in many instances dur
ing the last ten months, and several
score of property owners have complied
with the order rather than have their
property fenced in.
The latest owners to be notified by
the board that they must lay new
sidewalks in order to lessen the liabil
ity of the Commissioners of Public
Works with regard to accidents are
those at 926 Clay street, northeast cor
ner of Dupont and Washington streets,
1026 Market street, 126 O'Farrell street,
corner of St. Louis alley and Jackson
street and the southeast corner of Post
street and Central avenue. Others will
receive the same notification when the
bad condition of their sidewalks is
such as to warrant it.
Commissioner of Public Works Maes
tretti yesterday sent a communication
to Supervisor Brahdenstein, chairman
of the Finance Committee, requesting
that the urgent necessity fund be
drawn upon to repair the pavement in
front of the Phelan building, which ia
in a deplorable condition. The commu
nication, in which Maestretti asks for
an early answer, follows:
The roadway of Market Street, In front of
the Phelan building, is at present urgently in
need of repair and should be reconstructed on
a concrete foundation, the present pavement
consisting of bitumen on a foundation of
wocden blocks. The area to be reconstructed
is about 8332 feet, and at the rate of 23 cents
per square foot it will require $1916 36 to
perform the work.
The contracts- heretofore entered into by
this board with F. M. Yorke & Co. for repairs
to bituminous rock and asphaltic pavements
do not Include work of reconstructing new
pavements. It will therefore be necessary that
bids be invited for the performance of this
work under public contract.
It was announced yesterday that

Owing to the difficulty experienced

Etreet it was decided to hold a garden
fete for the cause at the home of
Mrs. A- E. Kent, Kentfleld. near Ross
Valley, on Saturday afternoon, Sep
tember 17.
Mr. Keast replied that the attorneys
edvised the committee that it was un
necessary to interview the Chief, as
the Police Decartment is well aware
of the circulation and should do its
duty.
Rev. A. C. Bane inquired as to the
law in the matter and Rev. Mr. Keast
'answered that the law forbids the
printing, selling or carrying of ob
eeene literature and pictures.
Rev. Mr. Bane asked in that case
vhy it is that the laws are not en
forced and wanted to know whether
Chief of Police Wittman had been in
terviewed.
The blame does not rest altogether with
f'hief of Police Wittman and others of the Po
lice Department, but falls -on the police courts,
Â» h^r* it is almost impossible for the enforce
xront of the law* r>y the police because Police
e .' . :-Â¦ - Â« refuse to convict. The prevalence of
crime In San Francisco is not altogether the
?Â»ult of the police, but !s largely due to the
Felice Jud^-en. who throw out the majotlty cf
â¢Â«at*e brought before them on mere technicall
.'â¢tfes. -
UÂ«m, if this matter should bÂ« officially called
to the cttention of the police, and in face of
that they should refuse to enforce the plain
law. Â»e thouid cipose them to the public.
If *e attempt to enforce the law we shall
have not enly to fight those who arÂ«* trading
In obsccse reatfnr matter, but we shall have
to fijrht the Police Department. And why?
Ji*cau*e eny 5ticceKÂ» which we shall have
* ould convict not only thosa; trading In the
â¢ Â¦rjectaonable literature, but the Police Depart
ment, hence the opposition we should encoun
ter.
Rev. John Stephens, pastor of Slmy

Dr. Francis Larkin, pastor of Grace

on Account of the circulation in the
city of vicious, obscene and indecent
o e reading matter and pictures which
had been exposed by the Rev. F. A.

Rev. Mr. Keast announced that the
hands of the committee entrusted with
the .work of suppression were being
strengthened and that among those
â¢who had come into the front ranks are
the members of the Epworth League,
c the Christian Endeavor Union and the

New England's Sociability.
If any one thinks that the people of
New England are reticent and unde
monstrative he should take a ride on
one of the little branches that strike off
from the main lines up country. About
two or four trips a day are made by
the same train, and each trip is like a
family picnic.
The one conductor has probably been
on the route for years, and knows all
his local patrons and their families and
pretty much all their business. Get a
seat in the car about half an hour be
fore it starts and . watch the people
come in. The exclamations of surprise
and greetings of pleasure are diverting
and heart-warming. As the car fills
with people it resounds with easy con
versation and hearty laughter.
There is no reserve, for all are
friends, except an occasional outsider,
who doesn't count. There may be more
reserve among the people of the cities
of New England, but up in the country,
where you find the New Englanders at
home and comparatively free from out
side influence, they are as unrestrain
ed and demonstrative in intercourse as
Is at all consistent with decent self
respect.
New York Deepening Channels.
A considerable time will be needed in
order to dig out to its full depth and
width the Ambrose Channel, which will
be the chief waterway in New York
harbor for the largest vessels when it
Is finished. Then, and not until then,
will the huge Baltic be enabled to go to
and from her North River 1 pier when
she is loaded to her full capacity. In
the course of a dozen years there may
be a dozen craft, each as bis as the
Baltic, voyaging across the Atlantic
and entering this port, every one of
them finding depth of water and room
enough for the transportation of every
passenger and every pound of freight
that can be carried within its coloesal
bulk. Then, indeed, will this metropo
lis on the verge of the sea have ample
reason for pride. â New York Tribune.

Nezv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â The same Influences
â¢which gave the stock market a reactionary
tone in the last half of the previous week
werÂ» oncÂ» more at work to-day, though these
forces were much diminished and the volume
of burtnens was smaller. Reports of further
dair.age to the crops in the West and North
west were again largely responsible for an
erratic wheat market, and industrial and la
bor conditions continued in a somewhat deli
cate state. Nevertheless the list showed con
siderable . resistance to bear attacks, which
were at no time very severe. The irregularity
cf the market at the outset was largely due
to thÂ« new turn of events in the Far East,
but London's purchases at this center turned
the tide of uncertainty. Further encouragement
came from London in the form of a statement
emanating from conservative sources to the
effect that our market bears genuine influence
cf broadening activity. These favorable fea
tures were partly offset by an analysis of
last week's bank statement showing that -the
recent increase in loans comes largely from
the commercial banks, and suggesting heavy
borrowing by merchants for fall and winter
trade. Yet, on the other hand, this very fact
is accepted by many as an Indication that
mercantile circles are confident of good trade
conditions, and are borrowing money with
which to extend their operations. Further
more, ' commercial loans are being made at 4
per eeat, whereas 6 per -cent was the prevail
ing rate for similar accommodations a year
ago. An early test of the market to-day
teemed to Indicate that the weak holders had
been weeded out In last week's declines, and
It was eoon apparent that a fair-sized short
interest existed in many of the more active
Issues.
Union Paclflc and Southern Pacific were well
supported. The early , movement in United
State* Â£teel preferred waa somewhat puzzling
the selling being regarded as good, but Pltts
burg and other points where closo watch la
kept on the eteel and iron trade sent In buying
orders. While only moderately active, the
market held Its early rally all through the
morals* Kfdon. There was sOxne activity in
Atchisc-n, and the grangers as a group were
helped by late reports of a big corn crop in
Iowa and Kansas. A sharp break in wheat
gave additional .Impetus to the market - In the

Almonds continue to advance under the In
fluence of the short crop this year, and the
market is very firm. New Dried Fruits are
steady to firm, with prices for the most de
scriptions romewhat over the average for this
time of the year. The carry-over stock cf
Prunes Is said to be less than figured on as
most of the spot supply, though still here, has
been sold and is no longer owned by the
packers and producers. It Is raid that the
unsold stock does not now exceed 250 cars.
Large sized Prunes show signs of being
scarce this year, and are already commanding
a premium. Aside from the low prices for
Prunes the Fruit market is In good shape for
sellers.

The cool, cloudy weather addeâ¬ to the dull
ness which usually prevail* In the fruit market
on Monday, and, although fresh receipts of
most deciduous varieties were comparatively
light, the market generally had an easy tone.
There was continued firmness in the best
grades of Apples, and good, hard Bartlett
Pears In wrappers were fairly steady, but
overripe offerings continued abundant and very
weak at irregular rates. The canners were
purchasing freely of Bartlett Pears, and avail
able supplies of bulk stock, which were light,
were pretty well cleaned up and the best stock
brought an advance of $5 per ton over previous
quotations. Receipts of Peaches in large open
boxes were unusually light, but small pack
ages were in heavy receipts and weak, except
for ftne mountain fruit, which commanded a
substantial premium. Ordinary offerings of
Plums and Prunes continued to drag, and
Quinces, Nectarines and Figs were easier. Nut
meg Melons and Cantaloupes were higher un
der decreased receipts, while Watermelons were
plentiful and easy, as the cool weather checked
the demand. Grapes showed little change, and
top quality lots were In good request, both for
local use and shipping account. Berries
cleaned up well at steady prices and occasional
lets of Raspberries commanded a premium,
some very fine stock selling In a small way at
$12 per chest. The recent arrivals of Mexican
Limes were chiefly of poor quality, and had to
be repacked, thus necessitating an advance in
quotations. Otherwise there was nothing new
to report in Citrus or Tropical fruits.

CHICAGO, Aug. 22.â Under heavy realizing
sales the wheat market to-day broke sensation
ally after having surged to new heights. The
n-iOtive for the early show of strength lay in
the conditions in the Northwest and. In the
higher English markets. Since Saturday there
had been llcht frosts In the western portion
of South Dakota, which, while not touching
the wheat sections, appeared to. show the
trade how precarious, was the situation of the
growing spring crop. Saturday's storm in
Minnesota and low temperatures in that State
were also a source of apprehension regarding
damages wrought or imminent. The opening
was wild and for a time threatened to atam
p*de J the trade again, but the highest prices
were obtained in the first burst of enthusiasm.
Lcter news was modifying, while a lack of
buying orders became a pronounced feature of
the market. Advices from Winnipeg that the
crop damage reports from there were grossly
exaggerated seemed to find approval. There
was a paucity of domestic damage reports
from the Northwest. The absorbing powers
of the markets was not equal to the task lro
poted by the dumping of large holdings. Sharp
declines in all deliveries resulted, September
selling down to $1 O9V4 and December to
$1 OfHJ. The close showed partial recovery of
the losses, the cause of the reaction being
covering at the bottom prices, but the final
tone was weak. September finished at 91 09*4
apd December at $1 11.
Corn started, as did wheat, under the In
fluence fif the fear of frost. Like wheat, corn
alF<c recovered from the scare, there being a
prediction of rising temperatures for to-mor
row. September sold down to 55*4 c. but rallied
under free coverinc at the decline and closed
firm at 54Â»Â£c. December declined to 62*ic,
closing at 53'^c.
Business In the oat market was moderate
In volume. September opened at 34%c an
advance of %c, and closed at 33%c, broke
Me off.
The provision market lacked sufficient ' sup
port. Pork closed at $11 50; lard was off 2%o
at $5 85Q 5 87 Â»,. Ribs closed 5#7%c off.

LIVESTOCK MARKET.
Meat Market.
Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â Liverpool futures were higher, but
Paris futures were weak;- The Buda" Pesth '
market Advanced 4c. The ' world's Â° shipments
for the week were as follows, in quarters:
Russian, 199,000; Danubian, 88,000; Argentine,
134,000: Indian, 187.C00; Australian, 83,000. j
The American visible supply decreased 233,000
bushels.
Chicago advanced from f I 10'i to $lll and
fell back to $1 OSU- Wires from there to Cut
ter. & Moseley said: "The trade Is getting
afraid of the price and the market is nervous.
The feeling la that there should be some
break." , Â¦
E. F. Hutton & Co.'s wires said: "There ts
no abatement ' of damage reports from the.
Northwest."
The wires of R. Brent Mitchell said: "Ttele
graphlc communication with the Northwest
was interrufrted and there was less crop news,
lut with the general tone and character cf it
unchanged. Threshing returns are beginning
to come in more freely and show a wide range
of results. The London Statist estimates the
world's wheat crop at about 200,000,000 bushels
less than last year. The action of the market
to-day was quite natural. It may indicate
' that for the time being the force of speculative
buying has perhaps spent itself. There Is noth
ing In current news, however, to modify the
previous estimates of damage to the North
western crop. - There are a good many con
servative men who think the three States wilt
not raise more than 100.000,000 to 125,000.000
bushels. We are approaching the first of Sep
tember and the question of deliveries on Sep
tember contracts must be something of a fac
tor. The movement has begun in the North
went. Some further reaction In prices Is not
unreasonable. We are Inclined to think, how
ever, that the way of the short seller will not
be a comfortable one as a rule. Wheat may
eell bade to $1 a. bushel; that would not be
an unreasonable reaction after so big an ad
vance. We are inclined to think $1 wheat will
not be high this year." :>
In this market there was good trading in
the pit, but the cash grain was weak, with
buyers Indifferent. Futures were somewhat
lower.

Private wires from Chicago yesterday said :
"Market opened strong on the low temper

later on weather prediction of higher temper

Ing of May corn. The general estimate Is
that there is a promise or at least a possl-.
: bility of a large crop. If we . get it the
price of May corn would seem high enough.
The cash situation is a steady one. There
are quite liberal receipts and a fair demand
and prices are not far from an export basis."

Joseph Grace, teamster, met a horri
ble death yesterday by being crushed
beneath a fbad of lumber. The unfor
tunate man was hastily removed to the
Potrero Hospital, but he was beyond
medical aid and died shortly after ar
riving.
Grace was employed by the Excelsior
Lumber Company and was driving a
six-horse team, which was loaded with
lumber bound for the pesthouse. As
the team was going along Thirty-sec
ond avenue South one of the forward
wheels struck a deep rut, which over
turned the wagon. The unfortunate
man fell beneath the pile of lumber and
was frightfully mangled. Pedestrians
ran to his assistance and extricated him
from the mass of wood. Grace was 41
years old and lived at 405 Fifth street.

There's not a dull sword thrust in
the whole play. The crowded house
testified its delight in a hand-clapping
that drowned the noise of the mimic
tempest behind' the scenes.
As usual with the excellent*'com
pany, the play went off like greased
fireworks. Eugenia Thais Lawton as
Princess Ottllle played the character
charmingly and she and Whittlesey
made a handsome couple. - Harry Hll
llard was the Sir John Beddoes of the
cast and when he made his initial en
try the welcome was so boisterous as
to interrupt a love dialogue between
the hero and the heroine. Miss Annie
Mifflln's "Michel" was a good person
ation and played with all of the ear
nestness that marks all the work of
that promising young woman. George
Osbourne's nose was a wonderful cre
ation and carried the house with it
wherever he went. The play has caught
on, beyond a doubt.
Considerable difference of opinion
prevailed among the audience last
evening as to whether fifteen or only
twelve ruffians ;were slain during the
sanguinary progress of the four acts
of "The Pride of Jennlco." There was
also a'dcubt as to whether at least six
of them were not killed twice â once in
the third act and once in the last. Basil
Jennico, who is White Whittlesey. in
disguise, gives the stomachache to
seven with his trusty sword"; Sir John
Beddoes, his friend, finishes four ot
five in as many seconds, and true love
triumphs in the fourth act, as against

Judge Daris and Senator Ltikens
pointed out the fact that these letters
passed between C. H. Rowley, pharma
cist, and George C. Pardee, M. D., not
between the Governor and the Board
of Pharmacy. It was also shown that
the application of Flanders, though in
dorsed by Dr. Pardee. was rejected.
The early part of the session was de
voted to an investigation of the ex
amining room and the skylight through

to have peered in search of informa
tion.

Louis Levy, Deputy Health Officer,
says the Board of Health is now pre
pared to take up the enforcement of
the ordinance relating to the estab

maternity hospitals and of private
homes where children are boarded.
The .managers of these places will be
required to call at the Health Office
and. make application for permits. A
number of applications have already
been made.
Two months ago Dr. A- S. Adler
of the Health Department and M. J.
White, secretary of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ex
amined many of the private maternity
hospitals. Some were found in good
sanitary and moral condition. In
others desirable conditions were
brought about at the suggestion of the
officers. A number of places were so
undesirable as to make it necessary
to take action at once. Several man
agers were informed that unless they
gave the children to the parents or
guardians they would be prosecuted
for cruelty.

OFFICIAL NOTICE GIVJfcLV
OF NORTH SHORE CHANGES
It was like old times at Fischer's
Theater last night when what prom
ises to be the best production ever
given at this play.house, "The Anheu
ser Push," was given its first presen
tation. The flowers were there in
abundance and the applause came in
shouts and roars as each member of
the company scored his or her indi
vidual triumph. The first act had so
many good things rolled into it that
it could have ended there to the satis
faction of the audience, and as soon
as the second and third acts are
whipped into as good shape as the
first there will be nothing left to tie
desired in the entire production. The
success of the piece is remarkable
when it is considered that former
Stage Manager Jones eloped with all
the., typewritten stage business, the
property map and other accessories of
the piece when he took his sudden de
parture : two weeks ago. The new
stage manager, J. J. Jayson, only ar
rived a few days ago, but with the
able assistance of Fred Conger, who
has the distinction of being Dorothy
Morton's husband, the production is
one of which the management may
feel proud.
Of course it was late when 1 the last
curtain fell, but this was due to the
many encores which the audience in
sisted upon and also to the return of
Georgie O'Ramey, who received a wel
come- back that must have warmed
the cockles of her heart. And Geor
gie responded by giving a specialty in
which, while singing a "Teasing"
song, she sits on the rails of the
boxes and indulges in byplay with
some* male auditors, which caused
laughter that set the rafters to ring
ing. She fairly divided the honors
with Dorothy Morion and that Is not
detracting one whit from the latter's
success. Dorothy never sang better
than she did In her rendition of "Wil
helmina" and the "Flower of Kildare,"
which will be sung by all the town in
a few days. Dorothy worked so hard
to please that one could well forgive
her taking a sip of the real beer,'
which is one of the features | of the
second act. In fact, the entire com
pany worked hard and the new musi
cal conductor, George Towle, is to be
congratulated upon the marked im
provement he has encompased in the
chorus singing. Rice and Cady and
Bobby North made herculean efforts
to tickle the rlslbles of the audience.
In point of fact, their efforts might be
tempered somewhat by cutting out
some of their lines, which fail to get
the desired laugh. No doubt the prun
ing knife can be used to advantage
throughout here and there. North
was funny as one of the burlesque trio.
Edwin Clarke "was there" with his
magnificent voice and his "Song of
the Toreador" and "Stein Song" were'
two of the hits of the piece. Ben
Dillon is an all around funny man and
has added an exceedingly - comical
Irish woman to his long list of suc
cessful characters.
Flossie Hope has a new partner in
Pearl j Hickman, who proved herself
a graceful dancer. Flossie was quite
overcome with her exertions and fell
from exhaustion at one stage of the
performance. Much can be said of
the scenic effects, two of which were
very pleasing, one being the St. Louis
Exposition ground at night and
other a Chinese ' pagoda at midnight,
where Miss O'Ramey sings a pretty
ditty entitled "Chinese Twins." The
opening chorus. "The Dawn, of
Peace," was a pretentious affair and
showed the various nations in their
prevailing costumes. The scene was
most effective and the singing of the
â¢ "Star-Spangled Banner" roused the
I audience to ah enthusiasm which was
j not diminished during the entire per
1 f ormance.

The complaint recites that on July 1
of this year the complainant entered
into an agreement by which its busi
ness was thereafter to be conducted
in this territory by the manager of the
Atlas Assurance Company. Limited:
that the complainant demanded of the
defendants that they turn over the
records and all other information in
their possession to the new manager
and that they refused to do so. Tha
complainant thereupon revoked the au
thority of Conroy and Brooks.
The complainant avers that by rea
son of the refusal of the defendants to
surrender the records and the required
information it is powerless to cancel
Insurance which might prove undesir
able, or to protect itself by reinsurance
or to renew Insurance that was ex
piring.
The Manchester Assurance Company,
a British corporation, filed a bill in
equity yesterday in the United States
Circuit Court asking that Thomas J.
Conroy and George W. Brooks be en
joined from mutilating, destroying or
transferring to any other person the
records of fire insurance business done
by them while acting as manager and
assistant manager of the complainant.
The complainant prays also that Ccn
roy and Brooks, be required to sur
render all records connected with thÂ«
business of the complainant.
Judge Morrow issued a temporary re
straining order and a command for the
defendants to appear in court nest
Monday and show cause, if any they
have, why the injunction and order as
prayed for should not issue.
M'lth this explanation and elnce no- one can

"1 suppose that the commission will j
pet after me next. It's been after j
everybody else on the board- More got !
out than I thought," said the stammer- j
ing Finger.
C. H. Rowley was then called and j
the correspondence between him and !
Governor Pardee was given out In full, j
Following are the letters that passed, j
The note was written at the end of â¢
Dr. A. C. Congdon's indorsement of H. j
S. Flanders, applicant to be made & i
licentiate without examination:
Althourh I have no personal knowledge of ,
Mr. Flanders' professional 6tandir.r or capablll- j
ties, I am assured by those who have such ,
kr.ow'ed**. anJ therefore believe It to be true I
that he is capable and efficient and worthy of
registration. GEORGE C. PARDEE. M. D.
The letter of Charles C. Rowley to
Governor Pardee. October 23. 1903. was j
es follows:
"Lock at these," paid Finger, and the
meeting was adjourned. leaving room
for all sorts of imputations.
After the commission had toured the
rooms in the College of Physicians and
Surgeons yesterday afternoon, where
the pharmacy examinations were held,
they cross-questioned Finger. That
gentleman hesitated, hemmed, forgot
and thought he remembered.
He heard Professor C. H- Rowley,
president of the State Board of Phar
macy, say that he had heard from the
Governor in regard to H. S. Flanders,
whose application to be made a licen
tiate was rejected. He couldn't re
member when he heard it or Just what
Â¦words Rowley used. He wac sure that
he meant no Insinuation against Gov
ernor Pardee when he flung the papers
In front of Senator Lukens.
FEARS FOlt HIMSELF.
The alleged veiled Intimidations'
against Governor Pardee that came up
at the last meeting of the commission
of investigation appointed to look into
the affairs of the State Board of Phar
macy took up most of the proceedings
of the commission yesterday. The ner
vous Professor H. C. Finger at the last
session, after asking that the question.
"Has the Governor or any high State
official ever tried to Influence the
board?" be withdrawn, finally drew a
packet of letters from his pocket and
flung it on the table before Senator
Lukens.
John Leslie, a waiter on board the
Government transport Sheridan, was
held .to answer yesterday by United
States Commissioner Heacock to the
charge of selling army subsistence
stores and pocketing the proceeds. His
bonds were fixed at 5300.
Frank W. Arnold testified that he
was entitled to quarters on the troop
deck and to mess with the troops, but
that he enjoyed life for a period of
nine days in the second-class cabin
mess. Second Cabin Steward Hann
mer, he said, had pointed out Leslie to
him as the steward, and the witness
applied to Leslie for better quarters.
Leslie gave him the accommodations
and the witness paid Leslie fifteen
dollars.
Captain H. P. Young, the quarter
master In charge, told how he had
learned several days after leaving
Manila that several men who were not
entitled to da so -were eating in the
special mess. He summoned to his
room Sergeant Lees of the Signal
Corps, Frank W. Arnold and Carswell
and they admitted that they had paid
money to Leslie for the accommoda
tions. Leslie also admitted that he had
received the money. â¢ Captain Young
testified further that he had been in
formed that . Steward Hannmer had
sold beds. No man could eat in the
mess, he said, without the knowledge
of the steward. When asked why he
had not taken Hannmer Into custody
he replied that he had not sufficient
evidence to convict him.
Leslie testified that he had acted un
der the orders of Steward Hannmer
and that he had given to Hannmer all
the money he had collected. He testi
fied further that Hannmer had re
quested him not to mention the fact
that the witness had turned over the
money to Hannmer and that when they
arrived at San Francisco the matter
would be dropped because he, Hann
mer, had "lots of influence." Leslie
testified further â¢ that he had been
obliged to work sixteen hours per
day. I. Â¦<Â¦
The reception committee of local
Knights Templar was busy last night.
To the most minute details everything
has been arranged to make their fra
ters from the East comfortable and |
perfectly at home before they reach j
San Francisco. The committee has !
been subdivided into squads of Sir j
Knights containing from three to seven ;
Templars.
Members of these squads in fatigue
will proceed to Stockton. San Jose and
Tracy to meet trains carrying brethren
of the conclave. A hotel clerk will ac
company each of these delegations.
Visitors will be assigned to their rooms
before they reach the city. All con
fusion and discomfort are avoided by
this forethought.
These reception squads will begin
their work Saturday, September 3, and j
continue until the day of the parade, j
Part of the reception committee will j
remain In this city, distributed around
the various hotels and depots.
Sir Knight George G. Clark is chair
man of this committee. Among his
able assistants are: Sir Knights A. F.
Burns, Judge Kerrigan, Judge Troutt,
Frank Sherman and B. C. Langley.
Escorts in full dress uniforms, with
banners and bands of music, will be
on duty to meet all trains and boats
arriving for the conclave from Satur
day morning, September 6. One of
the features of this escort, composed
of companies and squadrons, in full
dress uniform, is a special mounted
squadron formed of Sir, Knights of
Oakland Commandery No. 11 and Gold
en Gate Commandery No. 16, consisting
of two troops of twenty-seven Sir
Knights each, under command of Major
C. G. Toohey of Golden Gate Com
mandery. Troop A is composed of
members of Golden Gate Commandery
under command of Captain A. Wood
side. Troop B is composed of mem
bers of Oakland Commandery, under
command of M. E. Gaines. These com
mands are fully equipped with all
requisites and accouterments similar to
those of the regular army and Tem
plar regulations. Longer than a month
Major Toohey has been assiduously
drilling the Sir Knights as we'll as
their horses. .
California Commandery No. 1,
through Captain General R. P. Hurl
but, has offered for escort duty three
troops consisting of twenty-seven- Sir
Knights each, one the ( drill corps of
California Commandery, under com
mand of Captain R. P. Hurlbut, an
other to be commanded by Sir Knight
G. A. Clark and a third commanded
by Sir Knight R. J* Hathorn, thus
making five troops of mounted Sir
Knights for escort duty alone. In ad
dition to this, Oakland Commandery
will furnish one company of infantry
composed of its drill corps and com
manded by Sir Knight U. G. Richards.
This commandery will cross the bay
from Oakland each morning, taking
the first boat.
The Grand Commandery of Pennsyl
vania, together with Sir Knights of
Pennsylvania, will hold a reception
tendered to all Knights Templar and
their ladies attending the Twenty
ninth Triennial Conclave, in the marble
and maple rooms of the Palace Hotel
on Monday evening, September 5, from
8 until 10 o'clock. *; -
The advance guard of the Tennessee
Knights arrived 'in this city yesterday
afternoon and headquarters will be es
tablished at the Palace Hotel. The
party, which consists of about fifty-five
Sir Knights and their families, traveled
in two special cars, which left Nash
ville on August 15. The first stop was
made at Colorado Springs and later the
party stopped at Manitou and made a
trip to Pike's Peak. At Salt Lake City
another stop was made and the party
enjoyed a specially arranged organ re
cital in the Mormon Tabernacle and a
trip around the city on observation
cars. Prominent among the members
of the party are John B. Garrett of
Nashville, recording secretary of 'the
Tennessee Commandery, and A. N.
Sloan of Chattanooga. The majority of
the members are registered at the
Grand Hotel.
Colonel Pringle was born in South
Carolina about sixty years ago. As a
young man at the outbreak of the War
of the Rebellion he enlisted in the
Southern army and fought to the end.
After the war he went North and was
for many years one of the most pop
ular men in the swellest clubs of New
York City. He was also one of the
favorites in the tipper set at New
port, where all doors were open to
him. . For a time he was connected
with one of the railroads of the Mid
dle West. When Grover Cleveland
was elected President Colonel Pringle
was appointed Minister to Guatemala.
He filled the post with honor to him
self and his country and was trans
ferred to Constantinople. When
Cleveland was re-elected Colonel
Pringle was again stationed at Guate
mala.
Upon the outbreak of the Spanish-
American War the colonel was given
an important position in the transport
service, which he filled satisfactorily.
For the last two years he had been
connected with the Palace Hotel in
this city, where his genial manner
and frank courtesy won him the
friendship of all with whom he came
in contact. A linguist, a traveler and
a raconteur, he was always welcome
in any gathering and he will be missed
by thousands of friends both at home
and abroad.
Colonel Pringle's last illness was of
short duration. But two weeks ago
he was apparently in good health and
vowed that he was getting younger
every day. He was finally forced to
give up the struggle, however, and
submitted to the operation which
ended in death.
Arrangements for the funeral will
probably not be completed until his
kinsmen, some of whom are abroad,
have been heard from.
Colonel D. Lynch Pringle, well
known throughout the United States
as a politician, good liver and in his
younger days a society beau, died in
the Clara Barton Hospital yesterday
morning as the result of an operation
for hernia. Â¦

And now with the illuminative aid of
the players, headed by Arnold Daly, to
whose five years' long crusade we owe
last night's production. As humorously
as a musical comedyâ heaven save the
mark! It is Mr. Daly's, not mine!â goes
"Candida!" Again it thrills with the po
tent pulse of a "Hedda ; Gabler." Ajs
playmaking it Is the best of Shaw's
work, the half-dozen characters posed
â¢with life-likeness, the magnificent
sense of contrast of the consummate
artist. The drama is Inevitable from
their Juxtaposition. Candida is. the
hundredth woman, the poet the thou
sandthâperhaps the millionthâman,
and the rest of the ninety and nine.
Things must happen. True, the situa
tion, as the chief characters, is uncom
mon, but it does not strike one as Im
possible.
Very cleverly Mr. Shaw has captured
your sympathy for all his people. Par
son Morell, "windbag and orator,"
hugely in love with himself, and "his"
wife; Poet Eugene, in love with him
self also, but with a high self as altar,
an* with Candida; Candida, mothering
and sistering both of them; that emi
nent bourgeois, Papa Burgess; Lexy
Mills, the adoring curate, and last,
that admirable female, "Prossy."
Mr. Daly is, of course, .the poetâ an
Infinitely more difficult "part than that
of Poet Lonboy. A "wretched, little
nervous disease" he calls himself, boy
voiced, 18 years old. a "sponge"- on at
least the domestic sympathies of Can
dida and her husband, but the far-vis
ioned part needs the most . exquisite
sympathy in its portrayal. This Mr.
Daly, brings to it. Possibly his make
up is sllghfly, morbid, but the portrait
is otherwise sheerly convincing. :, He
might be a youthful Keats, a Shelley
flinging back impatient locks, for thus
Shaw â elsewhere, v as I remember, .with
out the faintest, poetic gleamâ has pic
tured him. 'One feels with him his pet
ulant torture at the everyday, common
nessâ the. onions/ "little red ones,",- the
AS REGARDS THE PLATERS.
With a wise instinct of self-preser
vation where the* "heartless Hibern
ian" is concerned, Mr. Huneker plants
a dart of doubt as to his seriousness
here. "If in this letter he is playing
fair in the game- " he says. Is he?
Or is it that with what Dr. Daly
stigmatizes as our shocking looseness
of language even Mr. Huneker has
failed to read him aright? To Mr.
Huneker, by implication, Candida is
a woman "who has gone through the
Venusberg and still reached the
heights." For this he has Shaw's
"immoral female," and "she seduces
Eugene just exactly as far as it is
worth her while to seduce him,", be
sides the lady's own famous "shawl"
speech, about which, however, Mr.
Huneker says he has "never deceived
himself."
But the "sense immoral" is much
wider than its narowed modern sig
nificance. Does not Shaw, who uses
words with exquisite exactness, mean
here a general immorality of inter
course, Candida's pretense of belief in
her husband as a great man, for ex
ample, her apparent deference and real
dominance in^ the domestic relation, her
"tact" generally, in short? And the
"seduction" of the poet. The phrase
has been everywhere pounced upon as
evidence of 'Immoral" relations be
tween the poet and Candida. Yet all
the evidence in the play points to the
contrary conclusion. Is it not here
again in the use of words that misun
derstanding comes? "As far as it is
worth her while she has seduced Eu
gene'sâthat she has stopped at a
psychical liaison does not concern Mr.
Shaw, with whom thought and motive
alone count.
WAS SHAW JOKING?
"Don't ask me conundrums about
that very immoral female, Candida.
Observe the entry of W. Burgess:
â¢You're the lady as hused to typrite
for him. No, naaow. she was younger.'
And therefore Candida sacked herâ
Prossy is a very select person, indeed,
devoted to Morell to the extent of help
ing in the kitchen, but to him the
merest pet rabbit, unable to get the
slightest hold on him. Candida is as
unscrupulous as Siegfried â Morell him
self sees that no law will bind her. She
seduces Eugene just exactly as far as
It is worth while for her to seduce him.
She is a woman without 'character' in
the conventional sense. Without brains
and strength of mind she would be a
useblied slattern or voluptuary. She is
straight for natural reasons, not for
conventional ones. Nothing can be
more coldbloodedly reasonable than her
farewell to Eugene. 'All will be well,
my lad; but I don't quite see myself at
fifty with a husband of thirty-five.' It
is Just this freedom from emotional
slop, this unerring wisdom on the emo
tional plane, that makes her so com
pletely mistress of the situation.
"Then consider the poet. She makes
a man of him finally by showing him
his own strength â that David must do
without poor Uriah's wife. And then
she pitches in her picture of the home,
the onions and the tradesmen and the
cosseting of big baby Morell. The
New ,York hausfrau thinks it a little
Paradise, but the poet rises up and
says, 'Out then into the night with
me â Tristan's holy night. If this
greasy fool's Paradise is happiness,
then I give it to you with both hands;
life is nobler than that.' .That is the
'poet's secret' The young things in
front weep to see the poor boy going
out lonely and broken-hearted into
the cold night to save the proprieties
of New England Puritanism, but he is
really a god going back to his heaven,
proud, unspeakably contemptuous of
the 'happiness' he envied in the days
of his blindness, clearly seeing that he
has higher business o nhand than
Candida. She has a little quaint in
tuition of the completeness of his cure;
she says, 'he has learned to do with
out happiness.' "
Brilliantly conceiving that her author
might know something of that very
much-explained lady, Candidaâintro
duced last night to us at the Columbia
by Arnold Dalyâ the gifted critic of the
Sun wrote him. asking him what he did
know. In his paper on "The Truth
About Candida" in the current Metro
politan Mr. Huneker gives Mr. Shaw's
reply. Here it is, "Shaw on Shaw," in
dubitably the most fitting preface to
anything one may have to say about
"Candida." He says:
Candida in Miss Donnelly's hands I
find not wholly compelling, yet with
much charm. To me she needs breadth
and her self-conviction. The famous
"shawl" speech â that we heard breath
lessly last night â comes without any
particular force lent by Miss Donnelly.
In the vernacular, Candida is talking
a little "through her hat" here, but
there was no sense of exaggeration
expressed, or again, if it were seri
ously taken, of the tremendous altru
ism implied. But she is on the whole
graceful and sufficient and possessed
of. a most charming voice and enuncia
tion.
Every person in the cast is compe
tent. Morell, substantial, self-suf
ficient, conventionality incarnate, Is
capitally handled by Dodson Mitchell.
Our old friend Herbert Carr, stouter
than ever, is deliciously sufficient as
the bourgeois Burgess. Thomas
Thorne does all that is necessary as
the curate. But next to Mr. Daly Miss
Louise Closser as Prossy, the type
writer, contributes illusion. As the
snappy, pert, flat-bosomed maiden
Miss Closser is the funniest thing I
have seen for some time.
There is one scene â Ibsen fashion,
and not a particularly beautiful one,
being a middle class clergyman's
"work-sitting-room," but you will not
remember that while you are seeing
"Candida."
BLANCHE PARTTNGTON.
coal oil, the scrubbing brush. One sees
the flash of his poet's insight into the
Morell morality, into poor Prossy's
love secret, into Candida's own limita
tions, arid the great lightâ let in by
Candida's sane, kind handâ of the truth
that it. is in his work he must find his
happiness.
Every phase of the character is
illumined by Mr. Daly. He carries
one with him in his every scene, unto
the last, when with white, terrible,
shining face, the boy goes ''out into
the holy night." â¢
