NEW YORK. Nov. 23.â Proclaiming the
defeat of ex-Governor Benjamin D. Odell
Jr. and declaring that his years would no
longer permit him to bear the burdens of
party management, Senator Thomas C.
Platt to-night Issued a statement em
bodying: a dispassionate review of the
Republican situation.
Senator Platt will go to "Washington on
Saturday to attend the opening of the
Congressional session. Before his' de
parture be ' called a meeting at the
Gotham Hotel of the supporters of J. Van
Vechten Olcott for the presidency of tfie
Republican committee, and It was after
the conference with them that he Issued
his address. He said that, personally,
there was little to choose between Olcott
and Parsons, but he expressed the belief
that Olcott should be elected and said,
that Olcott was esteemed highly by Pres-"
Idem Roosevelt. Senator Platt said:
"I am too old a man to wish to resume
precisely those, hard and trying responsi
bilities which I was once able and glad to
discharge, but there is one duty at least
that remains to me.
"I have been too much abused myself
to take any pleasure in joining in an out
cry and clamor against any other man,
merely because It is popular to do so,
and I shall not cay one word of personal
111 will | toward Mr. Odell, but the party
organization throughout the State has
been transformed from a solid, compact,
\u25a0well drilled army into a weak, discordant,
dissatisfied body, lacking confidence In It
self and distrustful of Its leadership.
"The wnole object of my activity in the
New York County situation is the recov
ery to the State organization of Its old
time vigor and quality. Mr. Odell's retire
ment wll! be a necessary consequence of
bis loss of the New York County machine
and there Is not a politician with half an
eye who does not see that this has been
already accomplished." â¢

LONDON, Nov. 23. â Tremendous ac
tivity developed in political circles to
day, consequent upon the circulation of
a well-founded report that Premier
Balfour had decided to bring his Min
istry to a close and to directly or in
directly appeal to the country. Rumors
regarding the resignation of the Cabi
net and the dissolution of Parliament
have been thick for three months past,
but when two of the leading Govern
ment organs to-day, almost in the same
; terms, ."suggested" the immediate res
ignation of the Premier on account of
the unmendable breach In the Unionist
party over the fiscal question, the "sug
gestion" was looked upon as having
been instigated by Balfour himself.
This I was strengthened by the \ knowl
edge 'that prior to the publication of
the' editorials B&lfour met certain in
fluential persons at his official residence
in Downing street. /\u25a0'\u25a0
â¢' These two facts when ; coupled led to

Fall of Rain In the Interior Comes at
Opportune Tim*.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 23.â A slight
sprinkle of rain fell to-night, but it
was not measurable, and -there is no
indication that it' spread. .over a wide
area. The valley of which this city
is the center is not sufferng for mois
ture although it would be welcomed by
th â¢ furmers In general. The entire fruit
crop has been marketed with unparal
leled success, and the orchardists are
rot worrying about the existing weather
conditions. It is probable that In the
foothills to which the valley leads
r.orth and east the lack of rain is most
felt. The rivers are very low. and the
effect is apparent upon the storage res- .
crvoirs. . which supply the water for
great 'electrical enterprises. Northern
California even In exceptionally late
TV inters is accustomed to its full quota
of moisture, and little, real concern is
felt because of the present lack of rain
although it Is admitted it would do
much good." ' .
â¢ SAN J<JSE, Nov. 23. â Rain began
falling here shortly after 9 o'clock this
morning and a light drizzle continued
all day. Up to 7 o'clock this evening
.14 of a.ri : inch had fallen, making a
total for the season of .24 of an inch.
The rainfall at this date last year was
4.23 inches. The indications this even
ing are for continued rain. This rain
with that of Sunday will do Santa Clara
County much good, as It will start the
,feed for cattle on the hills and enable
farmers \ and orchardists to cultivate
their lands. ...

BURGLARS ROB
BANK IN SOUTH
Break Into a Los Angeles
Financial Institution and
Cut Back Out of Big Safe
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ LOS ANGEL.BS, Nov. 23.â The Los An
! geles branch of the Nichl Bel Ginko, the
San Francisco Japanese .Bank, was en
tered by cracksmen some time last night,
the back of the safe torn out without
the use of explosives and cash amounting
to about $10,000 in gold, silver and cur
; rency- taken. â¢\u25a0 ' â¢' ' . '
The burglary was not discovered until
after 8 o'clock this morning, and- now
; that .'the detectives have had more than;
twelve . hours in which to work on the
case, they reluctantly admit that they
! have not the slightest clew to the iden
! tity of the thieves.
| The bank is situated at 111 Bast Fifth
street. Just off Main street, on one of
the most traveled thoroughfares In the :
city. Adjoining it is a bicycle repair,
shop, and it was through this that the
burglars entered by cutting a hole in the
partition.
In the banking-room the safe is
flanked on either side by a wooden par
tition seven feet high. The back of
the bank cannot be seen from the
street. The burglars "first bored sev
eral holes In the partition for peep
holes, and then attacked the , back of
the safe. Their tools were ..of. the best
known make, for .they left -some .of
them on the floor. Through. the outer,
steel plates the tools cut ai through;
soft -wood. With a pick the cement
and concrete fireproof composition was
torn away; then a hole -was cut In the
inner ; sheathing, and. lastly, the .sup
posedly burgrlar-proof strong: box was
attacked. This is. of half-inch steel,
but it proved no barrier to the cracks
men. A hole sufficiently large to en
able them to lift out whole trays of
gDld and silver coin was cut in this
box, and jj the burglars then, helped
themselves to the money. . ..*â¢ . .<
They took- out and examined, all the
checks, notes and . drafts, but after
sorting them laid them carefully aside. -
They dropped nearly 5300 in gold on
the floor, and did not take time to
pick it up. Then they left the build
ln*?. going to a wagon in the, rear. In
which they .carried 1 off: their boioty,
leaving not the slightest clew 'to their'
identity. Bej-ond the fact* of the rob-,
bery the detectives admit: that - they
know nothing" of the case, so well have ,
the thieves covered up their tracks. â¢ i .
The solvency of the bank is no wise
impaired. Immediately the robbery
was reported to the police the Central
Bank of Los Angeles advanced $15,000
cash to cover any emergency, . ami
other banks offered all assistance need
ed. The manager of the bank left last
night for San Trancisco. but Is expect
ed to return to-morrow. To-night It
was stated that the loss will be within
a few hundred dollars of $10,000. The
exact amount will not be known until
the return ot the manager..
eon. The fields are dry. and there has
not been enough moisture to bring out
the green feed. All streams are low.
The foothill country has suffered from
: numerous fires, due to the parched con
dition of the ground. The prospects for
rain are hailed with eagerness by
ranchers and every business community
shares the interest- >

President Arthur .Holland of the United
Railroads handed An] his resignation yes
terday to the directors of that company,
the resignation to take effect the nrst of
the .year. His action ;came as a great
surprise. . -,
Upon receipt of the resignation the
board unanimously adopted : the following
resolution:
\u25a0* Whereas, Mr. Arthur Holland has notified
this board* that he intends to resign the presi
dency of this company by the close of the year,
egalnst the earnest wish of the directors and
ot the stockholders; and
Whereas, His administrative ability has
during 1 the four years of his management
placed the United Railroads of San Francisco
among the twst properties of the country; and
Whereas, His personal qualities have en
deared him- to the comuany's directors and
officers: now, therefore, - t '. '
Resolved, That the directors of the TJnitPd
Railroads of San Francisco ' appreciate / the
faithful and efficient service rendered to the
company by Mr. Holland and by Messrs. Brown
Brdthers & Co.,'. and accept' the jiresidenra
resignation with great regret that he, will, not
reconsider and withdraw it.-
Patrick CalhduTi, in speaking. of the re
tirement, said: "The resignation of Mr.
Holland means no further cluinges in the
officials of this company. 1 '- Further than
this Mr. Calhoun had nothing to say.
It was learned last night that Mr. Hol
land's resignation from the presidency of
the United Railroad 'is ' the f result.; of
Brown Bros. & Co.'s . determination to
withdraw from the direct management
of the big local railway system. Brown
Bros. & Co. have always directed the af
fairs of the system and were responsible
for the election of President \u25a0' Holland,
who. is closely allied with them in their
various large financial undertakings. '
When steps were first taken in the East
toward the purchase of the Market-street
system and: the Sutter-street line an un
usually large amount of capital was nec
essary to swing the deal, and toward that
end ian ; underwriting syndicate was
formed- Brown. Bros & Co. were an im
portant factor in that syndicate, and by
the vote of the other stockholders they
were designated to direct ' operation of
the mads. President Holland was sent
here, really Vas their,, representative.
Brown. Bros & Co. have for a long time
claimed that? they; have fulfilled Jhe work. 1
undertake^ in behalf of -themselves 'and
other stockholders in the underwriting
syndicate. They have never been in the
business of . managing big concernsÂ»and
some . time ago expressed a' desire |to re^
linquish the responsibilities attending the
operation of .United Railroads. Since
then they have disposed of a large portion
of .their holdings in the company, and
having now. retired as the directing fac
tor, Holland gives up the presidency \u25a0 and
will, return to the East.
; Although It could not be, cpnfirmed- last
night, it 'is generally understood that
Patrick Calhoun, ; who has always been
the largest individual stockholder in- the
holding company of the United Railroads,
has augmented his interest in that com
pany by liberal purchases of stock* from
Brown Bros. & Co., and will continue with
his .aoldiJigsfin jthe local/ street ?railroad

More Than $12,000 in Cur^
rency Is Found in a Belt
SEATTLE, Nov. 23.â George Edward
Adams, for seven years cashier of the
United States assay office In: this city
and one of the best-known young men
In Seattle, Is under arrest, accused by
secret service officials of the theft of
$36,000 In gold dust, to which he had
access In his official capacity. Of this
sum ' $12,000 was taken, off Adams by
Secret. Service Agent Connell. who haÂ»
been at work on the case for several
weeks. Connell says that Adams has
made a practically complete confession
of guilt, stating; that he has abstracted
more than $30.000 . from miners" packs
since June last and substituted black
sand .to represent the, deficit. in weight.
Adams was -taken beVore United
States Commissioner Kief er this after
noon and held in $30,000 bonds to ap
pear for preliminary examination on
Friday next. Adams believes he will
be able to secure bondsmen when ar
raigned in court Adams made no
statement other than to demur as to
the amount alleged to have been taken.
Secret Service Agent Connell, on the'
witness stand, .testified that, from the.
result of his examination of Adams'
accounts -he had reason to believe that
the shortage would exceed $35,000.
Conneil gave "out \u25a0 this' statement:
Adams' it. ei hod ol operating . was :to substi
tute black sand, which occurs In nearly all
deposits of placer sold, for dust.. : whlc& .- was
turned Into the assay office to be weighed and
melted. ThÂ« percentÂ»ge of . <sirt in gold duÂ»t
varies. from 2 to S per cent, depending; on the
locality tram which It cornea. After the sold
bad beÂ«n melted the weight represented by the
\u25a0and would be charged to shrinkage, thus pro-.
; tectlng Adams from detection. This' shrinkage
became so larve. however, that the fact was
sufficient to attract the department's atten
tion and Inquiry resulting from this suspicious
circumstance led to Adams' arrest \u25a0 to-day. \u25a0 '
When I accused him he delivered . over
$12,000 in currency which he bad concealed tn
a belt'on hie person. He admitted to me that
It was his practice to extract the gold dust
and sell it to a local bank. It was In turn
deposited in the assay office to bo reduced to
bullion. Amounts varying from \u25a0 $20 to . $100
could be easily removed from large consign
ments of dust without any immediate suspicion.
Adams tooU currency in exchange for the duÂ»t
and kept It concealed > on - h la person. He told
me that of th? sum 'which- the department
knows to be mlaalng all had been extracted
during thÂ« present year, the greater portion
since June 1 last. He would have severed his
connection .with the office in December 1. and
under the- circumstances wÂ» had- but a rew
tiays left in . which to' make the arrest while
be waa still a Government official.
Adams said to-night:
"I do not care to make a detailed
statement of the charge against- me
until - I have secured and consulted
counsel. As cashier of the assay of
fice I bandied no money. I am con
fident that I can within two. days
straighten the matter up."
Jacob Furth and M. F. Backus, prom
inent local bankers, to-night qualified
SB bondsmen for Adams, each Justify
ing In the sum of $30,000.
George E. Adams Is. a native of Mas
sachusetts, from which State he came
to this city twelve years ago to accept
a position as cashier of the Massachu
setts Mutual Life Insurance Company.
He served In this capacity until July,
-IS9S. at which time he was appointed
cashier of the assay office by Super
intendent F. A. Wing. Adams drew
8. salary of $1800 a year.as cashier of
the assay office.
On October 16, 1904, Adams married
Miss Emily Clary, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Clary. The former was
for many years a United States bank
examiner in this district and the fam
ily It very prominent in social, circles
in this city. The wedding 'was one of
the events of the social season of 1904.
and was a brilliant affair.

MANSFIELD LECTURES AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
GREAT ACTOR ADVOCATES A NATIONAL THEATER TO ELEVATE THE STAGE
Says Proper Development t of the Drama Is
Beyond Means of Individuals arid x , :
fCommercial Companies. : f
Would Encourage Production of Plays by
Modern Auiftsf*s^U#iilef'Stiffi'ulus'''pf'.
BERKELEY. Nov. 23.â With much
wit and wisdom distilled from an ex
perience of many years as art
actor,' Richard Mansfield entertained a
great audience of university folk this
afternoon after prefacing his half-hour
lecture with a stout denial of the sug
gestion made by Professor Arraes, who
introduced him, that he, is an "enter
tainer."
Mansfield, lias not appeared in the ca
pacity oÂ£ a lecturer to college people
for so many years that the novelty of
the event and the unique fame of the
actor attracted an audience which filled
the Tug Harmon Gymnasium to over
coming.
'Mansfield indulged in much gentle
sarcasm, some directed at his public
and some aimed at himself, as he spoke
of the actor's life; of the public's part in
shaping the character of the euige: of
the need for a great national theater;
of the folly of those who think to find
superior art In the work of old, famous
actors, now dead, or who rave over,
foreign stage folk's work.
For critics Mr. Mansfield had no criti
cism. He spoke rather kindly of critics,
but defended himself on the charge or
his severity as a stage manager by in
sisting that if good work is to be given
the public the man who is manager
cannot gloss over bad work and that
the man who seeks cheap popularity
with his associates at the expense of
ignoring their faults as actor is not
serving his art nor his public right.
Mr. Mansfield spoke under the aus
pices of the University Dramatic Asso
ciation, being introduced by Professor.
\V. D. Armes, president of the asso
ciation. His address was as follows:
1 hope you will forgive me if I
read my little talk to you this after
noon, but 1 am cure you will under
stand that I have been very busy with
other matt*rÂ«, appertaining to my pro
fession, and 1 cannot, therefore, dare
to indulge myself in a memorized or
extempore address. Albo I would like
U< have it understood that what I
have to say to you is not born of the
conviction thut 1 know more about the
stage than ;iny one else, but, right or
wrong, it Is the expression of my per
sonal opinions and observation, and
that is. I sresumt, what you want
from nÂ»e.
it is a ertat pleasure and honor to
be here to-day and to talk to many
mho are interested in the subject of
th* stage and the drama. The very fact
that you are interested in this theme
ciust, ot course, be a source 6f congrat
ulation to me personally and to all
those who have at heart the welfare
of the theater in this country; and
Â«hÂ«n we realize the depth of this in
terest shown by your great university
and your -ambitious dramatic associa
tion it surely cannot be said that, at
least so far us the University of Cali
fornia is concerned, the stage ' and
drama sire likely to die of negtect.
Non fndÂ»ed is the stage likely to diÂ«
of neglect anywhere. But at this
zr.omeni it cannot be denied that the
stage is drltiir.iT somewhat hither and
thither, livtry breath of air and every
current ct tmbllc opinion impels it
Ilr.<t tn one .Unction and then in an
other. At one moment we may be in
the doldrums of the Knglish society
drama or we are slug-jriÃhly rolling
nlong in a heavy ground swell pro
ptllf-d by a passing catepaw of re
viva's of old melodramas.* Again we
catch a very faint northerly breeze
troin Ibsen or a southeaster from Mae
terlinck and Hauptman. Sometimes we
ect our suils to woo that ever-clear
ing brwze t>f JShakeepeare, only to be
forced out, of cur course by a sputter
01 rain, an Irish mist and half a squall
from GtxtTfe Bernard Shaw: but the
erÂ«at*>r part of- the time the ship of
tii(- stage is careering wildly under
bure poJfS. with a man lashed to the
helm (and let us hope that, like Ulys
ses, he haÂ» cotton wool in his tars), be
fore a hurricane of comic opera!
Press Is Public Voice.
But while the press, which is the
voice o! the public, is finding: fault witu
the condition of the stage, it is per
haps forgotten, that the public itself
is largely responsible for this condi
tion. When you need a fine President
you eU-ct one. and if you elect a bad
one it would be your fault or the fault
of a fHHliy machine.'. If you were by
any chance to submit to graft in every
direction, ba-1 municipal government,
to insi'flK i*i;t regulations, bad roads.

i liÂ«re lias heon ever since I have had
tlit honor and privilege, of appearing
before American audiences this same
outcry against the American stage, and
Lbere has always bc-en euincic.nt interest
ci work to make this outcry, but never
Â«i;'Jici<r.t Interest to do anything about
It. and lure is a case of talk versus
acting. Yet litre arÂ«; some ninety mil-
Jions of people, possessed of the great
est wealth of any nation in the world
H is just as easy to have a national
theater in this country as it is in
I'rance or Germany. It Is now some
seven years *ince 1 attended a very
delightful function in the city of Chi
cago, and. being called upon to make
fcome remarks and being totally unpre-
I>arÂ«-d, it occurred to me to suggest
th*! establishment of a national theater
\u25a03 lifs suggestion was widely .discussed
at that time by thÂ« prews, and itnmedi
ulely after forgotten. Since -then vari
ous eminent persons have stolen my
tliund< r; but mither my thunder nor
their, echo of it lia* cleared the air and
to-day the stage of this country as
indeed Englandâ is in the same unsat
isfactory'condition. And so we talk
iuid don't art.
â¢ We need a recognized stage and a rec
cgnized school. America has become too
gre&l and Us influence abroad too large
fur us to afford to have recourse to that
eitcient and easy method of criticism
r hlch decries the American and extols
t!io forÂ»<gn. That is one of those . last
i-mnantK of colonialism and provincial
ism, which muxt depart forever."
Do Not Dwell [on Past.
Neither ih it of the fiirhtest benefit to:
the etnae or to the drkma^or to the in
dividu.aJ Hctor,. for. us to be remlndfil
ujton every possible and impossible oc
casion *hat"Mr.- Garrick. Is dead. The
chance* an 1 that If M r. Garrick . were to
return to-<!ay hf would have a hard field
to 'plow, 1. c... if ' Mr. Garrick were : to
appear incognito aa Mr. Drabazon Monte
morency. for, instance, we should see Mr. 5
Garrick, . alias Mr. . Br&bazon Montemo
rency. reading: ' about \ himself in
thÂ« - mornlnp papers .something like
this:. "Mr. B. AL last Â» night Rave
himself all tho : aira of ja Oar
rJck, but where, oh where -was the
mnirit of the 'Garrick?".
When Mf. Garrick! made Tils first appear-^
ante \u25a0Â«Â« a'gentlenian who liad never acted*
before on any stage, he was Advertised-,
to play the life and death of King k Ãlch
erd 111 between* the first and .second
parts of a concert ln ; the vidnlty_of -Lon^
don 4 and such was hie instantaneous sue-
cess that, according to his own confes
sion, he never played to a poor house
during his entire career. Of course we
quite understand that Mr. Garrick
spoke after the same' manner that
truthful managers speak to-day. We can
imagine the elite of San \ Francisco
traveling to Oakland to see Mr. Dv
Puyster playing King Lear in a soiree
musicale and we can imagine what the
much tried> and overworked dramatic"
critic would have to say about It
if he said anything. But the matter does i
not end here. There were at that time
only two recognized theaters in .London. '
To-day in all capital cities their number 1
Is legion. Realize that London then was ;
not as large as Cleveland, and how easy :
it was for an actor of any ability â or a I
poetâ or a painter, to raise himself head'
and shoulders above his fellows, and yet'
more: Garrick was surrounded by a co
terie of delightful spirits, among which ]
were Samuel Johnson and Goldsmith and i
Richard Brinsley Sheridan and a dozen j
others known to, you all. The Prince Re
gent was there every night with a galaxy
of wit and beauty and he was
glad to give Mr. Garrick his * arm ]
or to be tooled down to Twick- !
enham or Richmond on the *box
seat of Mr. Garrick's coach. To-day the
actor may be gaid; as far as artistic at
mosphere and a literary coterie . may be I
concerned, to eat his heart out in â¢soli
tude. Where and from whom can he
draw Inspiration? In the days of Gar
rick those men who wrote plays came
with bended knee and bated breath and
whispering humbleness to beg Mr. Gar
rick to accept their work. To-day, we
look around a vast plain of emptyness
and if ux>on the horizon we decry the
nebulous figure of a nascent dramatic
author pressing to his puling lips a
sucking bottle of dramatic buttermilk, we
crawl to his feet and implore . him to
bestow upon us, regardless of cost, one
drop of the precious fluid.
Good Plays Scarce^
Can the actor to-day, remaining in one
city, produce with any hopes' of success
one piay after the other? How Is. he to
do it without a theater and a fund of
money? New and original plays he cer
tainly cannot find in the English lan
guage. . They are not being written, as
tar as I am aware. Perhaps they . are,
and it has not been my privilege to-, see
them. Then, must he translate the works
of Ibsen or Hauptman or Maeterlinck
and other foreigners? Can he depend
upon the wofks of the dead masters?
Shakespeare and Goldsmith and Sheri
dan or- Wycherly or Browningâ upon
Schiller or Goethe or Lessihg, Racine or
Corneille. Let me tell you that the stan
dard to-Uay is so much higher, the.de
mand of the public so much" greater than
in the days of Garrick or Edmund Kean
that a hasty or superficial presentation of
any one of these men's masterpieces
would not be endured.
Sir Henry Irv;ag.h^3. alas^ just passed
away and the wreath.of everlasting. fame
has been placed upon* his tomb in West
minister Abbey by : a-gratet'ul King and
Queen and people, but he was not able
to produce more than one, or at the
outside two, plays m.his theater, each
season and even that effort- bankrupted
him and he died to all intents and pur
poses penniless! The costly productions
inaugurated by Charles Kean, Kemble
and Macready and faithfully improved
upon by Irving and Calvert and other's
have. spoiled the public for anything but
the costliest mise en scene and it is not
enough for the actor to study his ; role,
but he must be prepared to devise and
superintend the construction of a mass
of scenery and costumes, of effects of
lighting, of the movements of a mob of
figurants, and he must have the practi
cal and financial, mind to meet the dread
ful question of expense! And do you
then imagineâ or rather, do you demand
âthat the actor alone of all struggling
beiugs to-day should be the ones to ig
nore entirely financial reward?. Docs the
clergyman preach the word of God with
out any earthly remuneration, and the
solicitor "plead ..the honorable 'cause of
his client for the love of Justice alone?
Where is this art of production, where
are these elaborate productions to end?
Productions' Costly.
It is very evident that any man,' be he
an actor or no actor, can with money and
with good taste make what is technical
ly termed a production. There is.- as
an absolute matter'of fact, -no: particular
credit to-be attached to the making of. a
production, i The real work of the stage
âof the actorâ does not He , there* It Is
ensy for us to busy ourselves, to pa&s
pleasantly our time designing* lovely
scene*, charming costumes and all the
paraphernalia and pomp of 'mimic gran
deur, whether of landscape or "of; archi
tecture, the panoply of war," or the lux
ury of royal courts. That is fun; pleas
ure and amusement. That again comes
under the head of talking versus acting".
No, the real work of the stage lies in
the creation of a character. A great
character will ljve forever, when \u25a0 paint
and canvas and silks and satins and gold
foil and tinsel shall have gone the way
of all rags. , ... ~
But the long, lone hours with our heads
in our hands, the toil, the patient study,
the roueh carving, of -the. outlines, the
dainty, delicate * finishing 5 touches,'!* the
growing into the soul of \u25a0 the â¢ being we
delineate, the ,, picture -of his outward
semblance,' his voice, his gait, his. speech,
all 'amount to a labor of such stress and
strain, of such : loving anxiety 'and* care
that they can be compared onlyj In my
mind to a mother's ; pains. - Ana when
the child Is born it must "grow in 'a 8:a 8 : few
hours to completion and be exhibited and
coldly criticized; How often, how, often
have those lone months ' of infinite toil
been In vain! How often has the actor
led the child of his imagination *- to the
footlights, only to realize that he- has
brought into the world a weakling or a
deformity which may-not live! And how
often he has sat through .the long night
brooding over the corpse of this dear
figment of his fancy! : It has become
lately customary with ; many actor-man
agers to avoid these pangs of child-birth.

OF HIS SINECURE
Cantankerous Friend of De
pew a Witness Before In
surance Inquiry Committee
OX THREE PAYROLLS
His Good Fortune Due to
Knowledge of Garbled Re
ports of the 1377 Probe
IsEW YORK, ?Cov.'23.â lt was late this
aftfernoon when Mr. Hughes, counsel for
the legislative, insurance investigation
committee, called to the witness chair
William S. Manning of Albany, referred
to in letters addressed by John A. Nichols
to Senator Depew at a pervious session
f 4.s the "cantnkerous friend up the. river."
Manninc was the most interesting wit
ness of the day and was Questioned close
ly by Hughes as to his connection with
life Insurance companies. He detailed his
work for various companies for many
J years and came gradually to the 'time
when he took up insurance work in Al
bany, and, as he testified, "was paid $450
a year by John A. Nichols to protect life
insurance interestsâ always in the interest
of the business, but not in the interest of
the officers." After several years, he said,
this amount was reduced to $300. He did
not know where Nichols was getting the
money, and had never inquired. He de-.;
nied that he had ever received money
from the 'Equitable LJfe Assurance So- |
ciety. When his_fee was reduced, how
ever, he understood that the Equitable, the
Mutual Ufe and the New York Life had
rach paid $150, and that the reduction was
due to the fact that the New York Life
had dropped out of the agreement.
An interesting part 1 of the testimony |
was reached when Hughes inquired con
cerning thp State insurance investigation
of 1877. Manning said he acted as an ex
port and found the reports of the pro
ceedings were "garbled and untrue." . He
testified that . he. secured a corrected re
port of the proceedings from the official
stenographer and had a. volume printed,
the alleged garbled parts having been
printed in italics. These were sold to
some insurance companies for $30 a copy.
The volume was copyrighted to pf revent
the publication of testimony contained in
.the work. He denied also that he had
made arrangements with insurance
companies to stop the publication of his
book. , : .
"I just grave it up." he said, when
Hughes inquired. â¢ ~*Z-'c'%' f
Hughes to-day read the contents of a
letter which he said had been sent to
the Governor of a State, then to an
Insurance Commissioner, and finally, to
the committee. It was written by thÂ«
bolder of a $5000 policy in the Mutual
Tleserve Life Insurance Company, which
he had taken out in 1885. At the end
fÂ»f the first five-year period he said he !
was informed by the company that he j
had paid in an amount in excess of the '
mortuary demands, and that a bond,
the amount of which was not stated,
was credited to his account, payable at
the end of ten years. At the expiration
of the 1 ten years he said he was in
formed that such unusual and extra
ordinary assessments had been made
agalnstihJm that the whole amount of
tl><^ bond was wiped out. At the end
of *the second five-year period he was
given enother bond, which he says he
Ftill had in his possession. At the Â« end I
of the third five-year period he declared t
that he was informed by the company
that he owed it $ISOO and that he would
have "to pay P. D. Q. or interest would
be charged against him."
Vice President Eldrldse of the Mv- I
tual said he did not see how such a i
condition could arise. ' Hughes gave
him the number of the policy and he said
lie would have it looked into.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â Three first
class battleships of at least 18.000 tons
displacement and eighteen knots speed,
three scout cruisers of 5000 tons dis
placement, one . gunboat of the Helena
class and four other gunboats of light
draught, two for use in the Philippines
and two for service on the rivers of
China, . with additional torpedo-boats
and torpedo-boat destroyers, are the
principal recommendations of the gen
eral board of the navy in its programme
of new construction to be authorized by
the next Congress.
At its meeting to-morrow the Board
of Construction, of which the chiefs of
the bureaus of ordnance, steam en
gineering, equipment and construction
and repair are the members, will com
plete its report upon the practicability
of the proposed types of ships'contained
in the general board's programme,, and
the two reports will be .forwarded to
the Secretary of the Navy for guidance
in the preparation of that portion of his
annual report dealing with new con
struction.
Although appreciating fully the ne
cessity of scout cruisers in time of
war, the needs of an adequate, force of
destroyers and torpedo-boats and the
immediate desirability of small --gun
boats for- service on the Asiatic sta
tion, several members of the Board. of
Construction are in favor. of concentrat
ing the fight for additional * ships upon
the first recommendation of the general
board â that for three new battleships. -
Whether the Board iof Construction
will approve the practicability of the
proposed new battleship of t the general
board's design is not certain. The
board is now figuring upon the possibil
ity of adding to a ship of 18,000 tons
trial displacement two 12-inch' guns in
excess of the number carried by ships
of 15.000 tons trial displacement. The
opinion of the board as to_ speed for the
new battleships is also awaited with
interest, .many officers being in favor of
a battleship capable of making nineteen
v knots speed, instead of '\u25a0 the eighteen
recommended by the general- board.

Organizations.
OAKLAND. Nov. 23. â Twenty years
after the death of Mary J. Francis of
East Oakland two of her nieces have
coma forward and protested the annual
accounting filed by the executors and
are contesting the will on the ground
that more than one-third of her estate
was devised unlawfully. The contest
ants are Hattie Thorndyke and Minerva
French.
The contestants base their case on
the fact that the First Baptist Church
of Brooklyn, the California College of
Highland Park, the American Bapist
Home Mission Society of New York, the
Baptist Missionary Union of Boston*
and the Baptist church at Santa Cruz
have been left legacies aggregating a
larger proportion of the entire estate
than the State constitution j allows to
be given to religious organizations.
The legacies to these various institu
tions have all been paid, but the con
testants ask that Joseph Wilson, the
â¢xeeutor of the will, be charged with
these beciuests, with interest 6ince the
fleath of Mrs. Francis on October 15,
18E6. One piece of property belonging
to the estate of considerable value is
located at 1309 Twelfth avenue. )

a mollUEk. the Lcttia gigantea. .
The result of Professor Loeb's expert- '
I mer.ts with these eggs of the mbllusk j
have caused him to revise theories pre
viously held. The experiments Include
the testing of the effects of hypertonic sea
I water upon ' mollusk eggs, with" a view
[ to determining how fertilization might be '
accomplished and also to determine
whether the action of the sea water and ;
! its effect upon the eggs are of a physical
ior a chemical nature. Professor Loetf,for- 1
' merly believed the action was of a physi
cal character, but now revises this opin
ion.
Discussing his experiments, Professor
Loeb to-day mado the. following, an
nouncement:
Two years ago I published the fact that I
vrati able to produce larvae from the unfertil
ized egs* of c*rtain limpets (Acmaea, Lottia
tigant^a) by rubmittiny these egrsÂ« for about
two hours to hypertonic sea water of.a certain
concentration; but -that 'l vu not able to pro
duce larvae by fertilizing the eges of. the aame
females with ij*rm.. ; Soon after I found, my 1
new method of artificial parthenogenesis' l tried
Jt also on the eggs of limpets, especially I^ottia
gigamea. -In cases where the treatment'jÂ»*ith
hypertonic Fea water alone did not- lead to the
formation of parthenogenetlc larvae tha combi
nation of a treatment of the eggs of the same
female with hyprtonic sea water and'a' fatty
acid led In most cases to the formation of
larvae from the unfertilized eggs of IÂ«>Ula.
Theee observations en the influence of hy
pertonic sea water on the process of maturation
are of Â«pecial interest Hnce.they seem to pave
the way for the decision of another question
that I have often alluded to in my papers on
artificial parthenogenesis, namely, whether the
hypfcrtonic sea water caused the development
of the unfertilized eyg by a merely phyeical or
by a chemical Influence upon the latter. At
ni-st I was inclined to assume that there exist
ed a direct physical influence of the extraction
of water from the egg upon tho colloids In the
egg and I used to discuss this* possibility in
my lectures more fully .than in my papers,
especially in connection with the work of
Hardy. But at the same time a possibility of
a chemical effect existed and could be account
ed for by th<> fact that the loss of water on
the part of the egg must alter the degree of
electrolytic dissociation unequally for the dif
ferent salts contained in the egg. One of the
results might be a change in the concentration
of the HO or H ions In the egg and this might
lead to a catalysis of certain . chemical : pro
cesses. Sinoe our experiments Indicate that the
Influence of alkali upon the process of matura
tion is a chemical one it Is probable that the
equal though weaker effect of ttie hypertonin
sea water upon the same process Is also chem
ical. I Intend to continue this line of Inquiry.

with changes in currlculums and methods^
of organizing college â¢wwrk.
"While the subject of football was
brought before the meeting nothing was
done. It was not formally discussed, the
members not having time jto take the
matter up. Much discussion; was given; it,
however, by the members ' between ses

There was a; feeling at : that .time that

sibly was .'not acting- in good faith, lie
was closely questioned .' by ' different

point on San" Francisco Bay. He â¢ was
requested â¢to place his application be

about ; the matter and they, are inclined
to favor granting: the application.
. In his , .application . to V' the board
Evans asked tor a deed in escrow, for
a ; year; from _the town of Sausalito for
Railroad avenue from Alameda Point to
its easterly ' terminus and agrees to
Commence work . here within a year, to
reclaim the tide land between Railroad

to have two hundred miles of standard

If : the road is not commenced within

within two years the line reverts to the

The .Trustees and many . prominent

that it would be . advisable to call a

Value Was Placed on Chair
VICTORIA, B. C. Nov. 23.-Japaaese
newspapers received by the "steamer
Ehawmut critlclss W. J. Bryan, now vis
ltinÂ« Japan, because of his attempt to
purchase the war stool upon which Ad
miral Togo sat when he attended the
Bhlnto ceremonial in Uyeno Park at To
klo to celebrate the naval triumph. The
stool, which was used for a similar pur
i\u25a0 *c for centuries, since 1607 has been
down in the Ogasawara family of
Efaintp priests, which family alone has
authority to conduct such ceremonials.
As told by vernacular Japanese news
papers, Bryan went from Yokohama to
attend the ceremony and asked to be
permitted to Bit upon a seat of such good
omen. No objection was made, but, so
the story runs, Bryan then tried to pur
chase the heirloom. As it- had sanctity in
the Japanese eyes there was only indig
nation. The owners replied Indignantly
that the war stool was not for sale.
The Jijl Shimpo cays the chair was
finally handed over to Bryan, at his earn
est request, after a family consultation of
the Ogasawaras. Learning after leaving
Tokio of the special character of the
chair. Bryan returned it to the Mayor of
Tokio, with a letter explaining that he
had no idea of the stool's exceptional
value to the Ogasawara family, and un
der the circumstances could not think of
retaining it. -
OnÂ© Tokio paper says Bryan secured a
common chair upon which Admiral Togo
sat, from a - restaurateur of Uyeno Park.

WANTS TAXES ILLEGALLY
LEVIED TO BE REFUNDED
United Railroad* Demands . Return of
Money* Paid on the Telegraph
Hill Bond Funds.
The United Railroads yesterday filed
a petition with the Supervisors for the
return of $1458 47 paid as taxes for the
Telegraph Hill bond redemption and
interest funds, which have since been
adjudged illegal by the Supreme Court.
The proposition for the acquisition of
Telegraph Hill failed to get Jthe two
thirds vote of the total vote cast at
the election two years ago, a fact . to
which attention was first called in these
columns. The amount to be returned
to taxpayers is approximately $35,760;
which is now lying idle in the city
treasury. ,
In Its petition the United Railroads
protests against the payment of taxes
for the school, hospital and other bonds
on the ground that the Supervisors had
no power io levy a tax in June, 1904,
therefor, because at the time the tax
was levied there were no bonds or in
terest coupons outstanding, and for the
further reason that the State and not
the city should assess the property of
the" corporation ! because it is in two
counties. ,
Demands Blk Leeal Fee.
The action instituted by Phillip J.
Cunningham, as assignee of the law
firm of Boyd & Fifleld, to recover $30,
000 for legal services rendered the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company,
went to trial before Superior Judge
Seawell yesterday. James T. Boyd,
surviving member of the law firm, "as
serts that his firm was employed by
the gas company In 1890 in litigatioh
with George C. Bates over .. what .\u25a0 is
known as the JCorth. Peter Smith tract,
and that It performed services reason
ably worth the sum sued for. Mr.
Bates was on the. stand all yesterday
afternoon reading *nto the record : a
bill of particulars of the work per
formed for the gas company and upon
which Judgment is asked/

Mrs. Anna Craig was found dying in
a small room of the International Ho
tel . yesterday afternoon by Officer "W.
H. Young of the California Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
She was so weak from the effects of
consumption that she could hardly
speak, and it took her two hours to
tell her short story. At her breast she
clutched her little two-year-old babe,
a pretty girl named Louise.
Mrs. Craig came to San Francisco
from the north and arrived sick and
friendless. She had no money and
could .earn but little in her weakened
condition. Secretary White of the so
ciety had â¢ her taken to the City and
County He :pl tal. The little one was
given .a . good home at the Maud B.

THE INELIGIBLES.
INVESTIGATION seems to establish the ineligibilily of the Cor
oner-elect and of some members of the Board of Supervisors.
One provision of the charter is as good and valid as another.
The charter fixes the* conditions of eligibility of all officers who may
be elected to administer it. The representatives of the Labor party,
during the campaign, regarded this clause of the charter as impera
tive, for theyraised the question of eligibility against Mr. Partridge,
the fusion nominee for the office of Mayor.
Had he been elected good faith would have required them to
contest in the courts his right to take the office until his eligibility
had been judicially determined and affirmed. Had he been elected
and his right subjected to contest it would have been unfair to
charge such contest to partisanship or spite and revenge.
The integrity of government depends upon the eligibility of
those who administer it. The constitution of the United States deals
with official eligibility. It provides that only. a natural-born citizen
of the United States or one who: was a citizen at the time, of its
adoption shall be eligible to the office of President of the United
States. If a powerful party, by an overwhelming majority, elected
an alien-born citizen to the Presidency, it would be far higher than
partisan duty to contest his right. The whole spirit of our. system
of government is that it shall be administered only by those who
have the legal right.
Because we have among us alien-born citizens well .fitted to ad
minister the Presidency is no reason why the constitution should
be overthrown to permit one of them to do so. He might even be
better fitted than any natural-born citizen, but that superiority
would by no means nullify the constitution. Federal law provides
for the filling of vacancies in the Presidential office beyond the Vice.
President, by providing that the succession shall descend to, the
Cabinet in the order of the creation of the different departments.
If sucji emergency" should occur in the present administration
and; the succession reached the Department of Agriculture,' its
head. Mr. Wilson, would be skipped because he was born in Scot
land, and the succession w-ould pass to Mr. Metcalf, the Secretary
of Commerce. This would be in recognition of the constitutional
requirement confining the office to natural-born citizens.
The provision of the charter of San Francisco defining eligibil
ity to office follows the spirit of -the State constitution, which pro
vides that no person shall be a member of the Senate or Assembly
who has not been a citizen and inhabitant of the State three years,
and of the district for which he shall be chosen one year, next
before % his election. It also provides that no person shall be eligible
to the office of Governor who has not been a citizen of the United
States and a \u25a0 resident of this State five years next preceding his
election and who has not attained the age of twenty-five years.
Of course the Lieutenant Governor must have the same quali
fications. Now who would pretend that even ,a unanimous vote
of the people could override these provisions of the State' constitu
tion? Their observance is 'necessary to the rightfulness and legality
of governmental acts. To override them would be an unconsti
tutional usurpation of power. The constitution also protects the au
thority of the judicial office in California by providing that no person'
shall be eligible to the office of Justice of the Supreme Court, or to
the office of Judge of a Superior Court, unless he shall have been
admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the State. . *
The greatest lawyer in the Union, becoming a citizen of Cali
fornia, could not be elected Superior Judge, lacking that require
ment of eligibility. It is not for any idle purpose that the Federal
and State constitutions and the fundamental law of cities in this
country so carefully guard the assumption of office by defining.eli
gibility thereto. It is done in order that no doubt or uncertainty
niay hang over executive, judicial or legislative acts, and also in
order that fitness may be at least implied. To this especially run
all requirements of age and residence.
It is in the same spirit and for a like purpose that tHe law fixes
the eligibility of electors, in order that government at its incipiency,
the casting of the ballot, may be well and lawfully grounded. The
courts define "eligible" as "capable of being chosen." If a person is
ineligible, his choice is , void and inoperative. The majority given
to him is as if it had not been cast. Every ballot ;n it isasif blank.
It cannot be counted. Any other rule than this of the courts would
make constitutions and charters a farce. â¢, . .
We make this explanation in detail, because The Call's dis
covery and publication of the ineligibility pi the Coroner and some
Supervisors-elect has been met in great bitterness of spirit by the
organ of the municipal administration, which goes far afield to find
a motive aside from the true one in which the exposure is made.
For our part we regret that the persons in the case are ineligible.
It is a disappointment to them and their friends, and it breaks the
desirable solidarity of ,the city government. But the law is impera
tive and must be obeyed, no matter what personal disappointment
that obedience may inflict.
THE NEW YORK ELECTION.
r>OME of the independent weekly papers in New York City,
having more time to catch their breath' than the dailies,, are
i^xL,, taking a coldly calm view of Mr. Hearst and his ambitions
arid his contest for the office of Mayor. They say that his- side at
tempted, if it did not accomplish, as much sharp .practice at the polls
as Tammany, and that the vote* he did get was not a vote for him
but was cast in a blind rage at conditions that could not be affected
by a change in the office of Mayor. These conditions were the
crimes of frenzied finance,<and the detestable methods in the in
surance business revealed by, the legislative investigation.
They say also that Mr.' Hearst's contest is made not in the ex
pectation of winning, but that he prefers martyrdom to. the Mayor's
office, because it will be more useful to him in his future political
aspirations. They see in him signs of .flinching from the shrinkage
in his reputation with certain factions of voters ni he had to assume
responsibility and administer government.
The law of New York formerly, and we believe now, is against
the reopening of the ballot-boxes by a court -a^fter the ballots have
been counted by the election* officers. This law is based upon -the
sound assumption that more harm will come from opening the boxes
than could possibly be done by any frauds. ? To avoid this injunction
of the law Mr. Hearst's attorneys seek from the courts a writ; of
mandate compelling the election, boards to reconvene, open the
boxes and make another/canvass of the ballots. But it is a maxim
of the law that what is forbidden to be done directly cannot lawfully
be done indirectly. â¢ .
The judicial canvass of the returns indicates that. Mr. Hearst
will gain an insufficient number of votes to elect himi " It has always
been his policy to raise a popular clamor upon whatever. opposes
his schemes, and the, attitude of his newspapers indicates a purpose
to attack the integrity of the courts, ir they do not give what] lie
asks for.
'If the opinion of the weekly papers to which we have referred
is correct, this will be part of his plan to become a- martyr. They
say that he simply followed in the wake of Jerome 1 and "Hughes, who
have aroused public opinion against the .numerous offense's financial
of which New York City has been the scene, and that socialism^and
other fads got into the same current* and joined votes to a, purpose
quite removed from his personality. They may be right. /We shail

TOYS AND THE IMAGINATION.
I Since this is the season of toy giving,
the \u25a0' following remarks* of. Dr. ; Grace
Peckham Murray, ., from the December
Delineator, have a special interest: ;
"The. tendency of the present 'time, is
to overload children with toys! Far
froni being a help to a child, this de
frauds him. He should not have a sur
feit of I any . of his senses. Toys, can jbe
made the means of great development.
They should be such as will aid the im
agination and I stimulate the inventive
faculty. The Imagination of . the
child is his most precious faculty.
I cannot lament with a recent
writer the mental activity of the child
of to-day, who would rather have a piece
of machinery- or an electrical toy that
he can pull to > pieces and put together
again than old-fashioned playthings.
Rather one should rejoice that the brain
activity of children expends Itself on
that which is useful. I have seen, a
boy's eyes sparkle with enjoyment j and
intelligent Interest when: at -10 year's; of
age he was working over an electric
battery. His mind was grasping the
mysteries of physics with a' sureness
that would have done credit, to an older
mind. The' point , is: Arouse the chil
dren's minds and imaginations . through
their games, their. toys. .to an interest in
that which will be useful to them /all
their lives.' Then there, will not be need
of so much cramming at school.". -\.
WORTHY OF A GOOD HUSBAND.
The West Somerville young 1 woman
who wrote to the South Dakota census
department that. she wanted a husband
and wished to get into correspondence
with a "refined moral person" among
the surplus bachelors of the Prairie
State should be encouraged, says the
Boston Globe. Any girl with Initiative
enough to write such a letter, courage
enough to avow her wish .for a good
husband and energy enough" to become
the wife of a Western farmer should
have no j difficulty in' finding a proper
partner. Somef girls who want/hus

BLOOD-RED APPLES.
: Professor James A. Graves of this
city has- jugt sent to ; Professor Surface,
the.^ State Zoologist, a peculiar apple,
the strange coloring of which ha* ex-;
cited" his curiosity and for which he
cannot, , although tie Is a botanist of
forty, years''- experience, .account,, says
the Susquehanna : (Pa.). correspondent
of the Philadelphia Record.- ' 7 J. * .-:
Professor Graves says that last sum-,
mer ; he was" at ' Stockport, Pa., and was
shown a very old' apple tree on the
estate of j Ann Preston. -- He (was told
that it bore apples with greeniah yel
low I skin under, which" was a blood-red
pulp to the" core. He arranged, that
several of 'the apples should be sent to
him when they ripened and he recently
received them. '.They are ordinary look
ing on the outside,: but 'upon cutting
them openVthey are at, first blood red
and-near the core turn to^ a purple.
There is ah Indian legend connected
with the tree which is generally be
lieved by the common people of the
vicinity. An Indian chief of the-Dela
wares, named Walla .Wocka, was ; out
hunting one day and was murdered -by
a member.of his tribe, who; in order to
conceal the; crime,' buried his body at
the foot of the old apple tree> I -i :'/: '/j :;.' : '
The disappearance of f the chief re
mained a mystery to his tribe until ithe
fall of the year, when the apples, being
plucked, were found to be blood red. ;
Searching for the cause of this trans
formation, members of â¢ the r tribe; dug
about the roots and. found the .body of
their murdered chief. .'.*/.
; Ever since then the apples -have re
mained blood red, say those who- recite

SARGENT'S LOOT
Diamond Thief to Be Charged
Upon Seven Counts of
Grand Larceny To-Morrow
TRACING OLD OKIMES
Police Feel Sure That This
Man Kobbed Salesman of
a Buffalo Eing Company
Francis T. Sargent diamond thief, who
was arrested several days ago by Detec
tives Ryan and ODea of this city, will
be, charged with seven counts of grand
larceny on Saturday. In addition to the
thefts the prisoner has committed In this
city, the police have traced and recovered
$1500 worth of Jewels stolen from a sales
man of the Niagara Ring Manufacturing
Company of Buffalo, and there is little
doubt that Sargent committed this crime.
Sargent according to the police, is an
experienced thief. An effort is being
made to ascertain -what he has done in
the past and it Is believed that he may
be wanted in many cities and for various
offenses. Yesterday he admitted to the
detectives that his wife had a guilty
knowledge of his criminal work and that
he had a confederate. The name of the
latter he refuses to reveal, but it is likely
that an arrest will be made very soon
If the guilty party has not left the coast
Charles Lawrence, the salesman from
whom the diamonds were stolen, dis
played his wares to the Jeweler. Sar
gent purchased two rings and deftly pur
loined 6ix others, so it Is claimed. The
loss was not discovered until some time
afterward. Pinkerton detectives Investi
gated the matter and suspicion was di
rected to Sargent Until the recent expose
cf the jeweler's work, however, nothing
was done, but effort was rinewed yester
day by the local police, and Sargent, in
ppite of his denials, offered the detectives
a clew. The diamonds were recovered In
the safe of the Santa Fe Company's sta
tion at Point Richmond. Sargent was of
ficial* watch repairer for the company and
had had access to their strong box. When"
'the safe was searched a package contain
ing the six ringe was found and these
rings have been identified as those stolen
from Lawrence last September.
Regarding his wife, Sargent says that
she knew what was going on. In the
first place, he asserts, she was aware of
what stock they had In the store and of
the funds available to purchase more. She
was present on occasions when he com
mitted thefts and, while he will not ac
cuse her of participating in them, he
does say that she realized he was steal
ing and knew what became of the loot
Detectives Ryan and ODea claim they
will not arrest or charge Mrs. Sargent
unless some of the complaining witnesses
against her husband desire that she be
imprisoned.
Mrs. Sargent enters a strong denial*
that she ever knew of any criminal trans
action on the part of her husband.
Who Sargent's accomplice was has not
been ascertained by the police. Sargent
cays he had. one, but will not tell who
he" is. Captain of Detectives Burnett has
ordered that the man be kept in close
confinement and the prison keepers have
been instructed to permit no one to Bee
him. It is expected that he will break
down and confess to a number of other
crimes he is now concealing from the de
tectives. .......

KELLY'S JOKE
ENDS SERIOUSLY
Gaddini Says He Shot at a
Supposed Footpad and- Not
at Eival for Girl's Hand
X 0 WOMAN IN THE CASE
Eoti Men Emphatically Deny
They Ever Quarreled Over
Affections of Miss Wall
The shooting of Robert Kelly by Er
nest Gaddini in front of the residence of
Dr. Lux, 1214 Vallejo street, at midnight
on Wednesday was the result of a prac
tical Joke, according to the statements
of both men. Gaddini yesterday was re
leased on !100 cash bail. He told the
police a straightforward story of how the
shooting happened. His tale is borne out
by Kelly. Both jj swear the shoot-,
log was accidental and that no bad
blood existed between them over the af
fections of Miss Gertrude Wall.
According to the Btory told by both
men. Kelly left his house shortly before
midnight A merry party had been In
progress there, and Kelly escorted Miss
Wall to her home. 1602 Hyde street When
he neared his home on 'his way back, he
perceived Gaddini and another friend, V.
C. Derham, approaching.
Kelly thought it would be a good Joke
to frighten the pair, so he stepped into
the shadow of Dr. Lux's fence and await
ed their arrival. When they approached.
Kelly Jumped out and said: "Hold up
your hands." Gaddini. thinking he was
being attacked by a foodpad, quickly
emptied his revolver at the supposed
thug. Kelly fell wounded at the last
shot
When he bent over his victim, Gaddini
says he recognized Kelly. Derham was
so badly frightened by the shots that he,
too, fell to the ground, though he waa
uninjured. According to the statements
of both men, Gaddini rushed at once to
telephone to the Central Emergency
Hospital for an ambulance and did not
try to escape, as was reported.
MISS WALL. DISTRESSED.
In the meantime a big crowd began to
gather and the police arrived on the
scene. The story was circulated that
the men had Quarreled over Miss Wall,
that Gaddini lay in wait for his victim,
and when he saw his chance, fired at him,
and. thinking him dead, fled.
Detective Harry Braig was detailed on
the case, and after an investigation* came
to the conclusion that both men are tell
ing the truth. Miss Wall Is 'very much
distressed over the matter and refuses
to discuss It at all. She, however, scoffs
at the Idea of the men quarreling over
her.
Kelly's wound Is not serious. The bul
let entered back of the ear and pene
trated the fleshy part of the face. He
had a narrow escape from Instant death.
After being treated at the Central Emer
gency Hospital yesterday, he was re
moved to St Joseph's Hospital. The doc
tors say he will soon recover. â¢
If either of the men had quarreled over
Miss Wall, they deny the facts very em
phatically. Gaddini cays he. barely knew
the young lady, having met , her but
twice. He also claims Kelly was a very
good friend of his and that they never
bad a quarrel. . .
KELLY WILL NOT PROSECUTE.
Gaddini Is a prepossessing looking
young 1 man, 20 years old and a son of the
late John Gaddlnl, a well-known wine
merchant. He conducts the business of
his late father at 525 Montgomery street,
and lives a few doors away. He .says he
has been In. the habit of carrying a re
volver, as there have been many holdups
la the vicinity of his home lately.
Kelly 'says he "will not prosecute his
friend under any' circumstances, so the
charge of assault with a deadly weapon
that has been placed against Gaddlm
will probably never be pressed.
As the ambulance carrying Kelly was
being driven to the Central Emergency
Hospital by Driver John McCarthy it
narrowly missed being injured by run
ning into an unllghted obstruction at the
corner of O'Farrell street and Van Ness
avenue. The presence of the unllghted
obstruction was reported to Lieutenant
Colby of the City Hall station, but he
paid no attention to it. Two other re
ports were made, but nothing, was done
all night. Many persons who were driv
ing by were In danger of their lives.
WILL FORM CLASS FOR .
FEEBLE-MINDED PUPILS
Board of Education Grant* Appeal of
i - Parents and Considers Bids
. for New School.
A delegation of parents of' feeble
minded children appeared before the
Board of Education yesterday and
made an urgent appeal that a class be
established for the accommodation of
their offspring. It was stated that at
least thirteen children desired to avail
themselves- of educational , privileges
separate from the regular schools.
Superintendent Langdon heartily fa
vored the plan and recommended that
tha board carry it out The recom
mendation was adopted unanimously
and Director Boyle was delegated . to
arrange; for the placing of a portable
schoolhouse on the school lot located
on Bush street, near Hyde. Langdon
eaid that a number of feeble-minded
children now attending the regular
schools would probably apply for ad
mission to the separata school. Tha
class will be formed on January 2, 1906,
when the schools open for the new
term."
The: Board of Education discussed
with Works Commissioner Aigeltinger
and City Architect Shea bids for the
Washington, Lagunda Honda and Sun
nyslde schools, which were opened
Wednesday and are all below the esti
mates of oost It was decided to post
pone action until to-morrow morning,
\rhenjt is understood that the bids will
be accepted so that , work may be
rushed on the buildings, which are sad
ly needed.

they would rob the first man they met
This man happened to be Officer Scott,
who had been detailed to watch the or
phan asylum ruins..- He resisted, and was
shot dead by Edwards. The men did not
search the body, but fled from the .city to
Stockton. Three of them finally arrived
in Sonoma County, where they, burglar
ized the house of \u25a0\u25a0 Judge. WV C. Wallace,
who apprehended them and they were sent
to the San . Quentin prison. After their
release they were tried In Sacramento
for the Scott. murder before the Superior
Court. On * the understanding that
they would receive life sentences the
three men confessed their complicity in
the Scott murder. Edwards escaped to the
East, where he committed another crime
and was sent to a penitentiary. O'Brien
is one of I the three life termers who
pleaded guilty. Whether or not he en
tered a formal plea is a question which
the local authorities do not attempt to
say, but they consider he has been a long
time discovering his; alleged 'ground for
release. So far as Is known here his
commitment to prison was In the regular
form. . '

Said v Was' Genuine
FELICITATES DEVISEE
Tells Him 1 Money Will Be
His; but Later Changes
View and Goes to Other Side
Thomas P. Burns,; paying teller, of the
Sub-Treasury," has at . least^ the courage
of his last conviction. This fact ;.was
demonstrated yesterday when he was on
the stand 'as a witness in , the contest of
thÂ© codicil. of thÂ» will ofjthe late Million
aire Samuel Davis. He appeared for the
contestants, declaring under, oath that in
his opinion the codicil is a forgery.'-How
ever, he calmly admitted that during a
period of aix months .following his first
examination of the instrument ?. he "\u25a0. in
formed Attorney Garret McÂ£2nerney and
John J. Barrett, \u25a0 of counsel for the pro
ponents, >\u25a0 and Harry Creswell, a benefi
ciary, that It waa unquestionably â¢ gen
uine, and that he was among the first and
happiest ' to congratulate Attorney ' Cres
well, hiÂ» friend, upon the \ fact that he
was .named as a beneficiary in such a
sound and unassailable addendum to the
last testament of the. deceased.
He was first shown a photograph of
the codicil by Mr. ; Creawell, ' he said, and
later informed Mr." Creswell that after
a "hasty, casual and cursory" examina
tion of the Instrument he had concluded
that there' could be no question as to the
validity of the instrument. He congratu
lated Mr. Creswell, he further admitted,
upon the good fortune that bad befallen
him as a beneficiary. Glancing up from
the exemplar In his, hands Mr.~ Burns saw
Attorney. Creswell standing In the court
room, and he hastily withdrew his state
ment that he had Informed ; the attorney
that his examination \of tha codicil ' was
"hasty,* casual and cursory."
Continuing, Burns admitted that after
seeing Mr. Creswell he called on Mr. Mc-
Enerney and told, him that the will was
genuine. Subsequently he- was summoned
by. Attorney Pomeroy and Carl Bisen
schimel, who requested that he examine
the codicil and exemplars of decedent's
handwriting. He did so j and at the end
Informed Mr. Pomeroy that he saw no use
for further labor on the Instrument; that
he did not care to be a witness, In the
first place, 1 as he had: other things: to* do.
The following morning, he telephoned |to
Mr. Pomeroy that . he saw no reason to
change his opinion- that the . codicil was
genuine. . ' ~ â¢ \u25a0 . ; '
Later, upon request of Mr. McEnerney,
he consented to be a witness for the pro
ponents and was introÃuced to Attorney
! Barrett, who supplied him with a photo
| graph of the codicil and others of ad
! mittedly genuine handwritln|s of the de
ceased. - â¢ â¢\u25a0\u25a0 i .
Six months after this, he admitted, he
telephoned to Mr. Pomeroy and told him
that ne had changed his opinion as to the
ginluneness of the codicil; that he had
finally reached the copcluslon that it .was
a forgery and he would take 'the stand
and so testify if it was the "desire of. the
contestants that he do so. It was the. de
sire of the contestants that he so' testify,
"and," said. Burns, "I (am here, and my
present opinion is that the codicil is. a
forgery." .â¢â¢ /â¢â¢â¢\u25a0-.- \u25a0' '\u25a0\u25a0./*\u25a0.\u25a0

GO IN HASTE
TO BE SWORN
Officials-Elect Whose Qual
\u25a0 ifications Are Disputed
Take the Oaths of Office
USE ALL PRECAUTION
Walsh, Furey, Wilson l and
Phillips Appear Before the
; County Clerk and Auditor
The four officials-elect of the City and
County of Sari Francisco whose disqual
ifications for the i offices to which they
were elected have been made known by
The Call during the last few days, have
taken every precaution ; to secure their
positions. With frantic. haste they ap
peared at the office of the County Clerk
yesterday morning and there : took their
oaths . of- office. | They only received their
certificates of 'election from the Board of
Election Commissioners /on Wednesday
evening, after the municipal 'offices' were
closed, and . it was then too late to file
their oaths, but on the first opening of
the offices the next morning they were
there to fulfill : this . last requirement.
The four are William J. Walsh, Coroner
elect, and Andrew .;M.' Wilson, Jennings
Phillips and 'J. J. Furey, Supervisors
elect They -were quickly sworn in In the
presence of Deputy. County Clerk Lee.
Then, to make sure that they had made
no blunder and that they had done every
thing in their power to secure their seat
ing in office next January, these four suc
cessful candidates scurried to the office of
Auditor Harry Baehr and there filed an
other set of oaths. In the history of the
office this is the first time that the oaths
of the candidates who had received their
certificates of election were filed with the
Auditor and the spectacle of these four
men signing their " names to the form
caused a' great deal of attention. The
news of .their actions quickly spread
through the corridors of the City HalL
The actual taking of their oaths does
not change | the legal standing of the of
ficials-elect, but merely completes every
step which they must taka prior to, their
final installment in office. The only way
a -contest can now be begun Is by ."n ap
plication to the Attorney General for a
writ of quo warranto. In the meantime,
with the certificates of election In their
pockets, these officials-elect, who seem to
be clearly disqualified under the provis
ions of the charter, will draw their sal
ary after the date of their Installment In
office until they are ousted.

SENSATIONAL FORM
Favorites Have Another Bad Inning at
Oakland â Lord Nelson Wins.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Callaghan, a chestnut colt by Borgria-
Engea. owned by J. C. Nealon, gave an
exhibition of Â«peed in the last race on the
card at Oakland yesterday well worth see-
Ing. The light downpour of rain had
eerved to lay the dust and leave a springy
cushion on the course. It was a slx-fur
long dash in which Callaghan earned dis
tinction, with Barney Schreiber's
Deutschland ruling an odds-on choice.
CaH&ghan attracted no especial attention,
bis odds soaring to S and 9. He had Mc
"BrldÂ© in the saddle and showed first
about as soon as the barrier was sprung.
Stepping off the first half mile In :47Vi.
the three-year-old breezed in the easiest
â¢ort of a winner, nearly three lengths
ahead of Romaine. In 1:13. Knapp finished
third with the favorite.
FORM AT A DISCOUNT.
Prom start to finish there was nothing
but .upsets, Maid of Fermoy being- the
lone favorite to land. Despite the inclem
ency of the weather the crowd was large.
Lord Nelson, a 15 to 1 shot, ridden by
little Sandy, an apprentice, took tho'ln
troductory scramble for maiden two-year
olds. Apparently the previous good race of
the youngster was entirely overlooked. He
was out In front from the start and won
cleverly from the second choice, Louis
Schumacher, the Keene stable entry. Ma
eel, the favorite, ran unplaced, the show
falling to Captain Burnett.
Neither Edinborough. the favorite, nor
Dargin, the second choice, was among
the first three at' the finish of the five
and a half furlong run, with the weights
raised ten pounds above the scale. Edin
borough led almost to. the head of the
lane, when Blumenthal, a 7 to 1 chance.
with Barrett up, assumed command and
waltzed home first. Olympian, a backed
Â£ to 1 shot, disposed of Sacredus for third
place.

\u25a0end a twister, landing right side up in
the mile and & sixteenth selling fracas.
The race preceding run by her ladyship
was not such a becoming one, but throw
that out. She was half a dozen to one
yesterday and In a biff-bang finish de
feated the 4 to 6 favorite, Watercure, by
ahead. Ethel Abbott at 40 to 1 ran Into
the show.
Through diligent use of his trusty "bat"
"Big Bill" Knapp forced Maid of Fermoy
in a nose before Lerida for the first seven
furlong selling purse. Melar made the
running until well into the stretch, where
ehe weakened. The winner went to the
post a 7 to 5 favorite.
Milton Toung ran amuck in the second
Beven-furlong run, costing bis followers a
hogshead of coin. The Williams entry
\u25a0was supposed to be the one big cherry
rspe flat bet of the day. and by degrees
his price melted from fives to 8 to 5. Mil
ton had a stormy passage, finishing third.
Joe Kell>' slipped away In front with the
15 to 1 shot Phalanx and without being
extended downed Del Coronado by more
than a length.
XOTES OP THE TRACK.
Dr. Rowell purchased Lord Nelson
from Johnny Mlllin about a year ago.
Good Hope, the youngster's dam. was
owned and raced by the late Caesar
Toung.
Barney Schreiber's Bertola was
backed off the boards in the betting
on the first event. 20 to 1 being the, top
price. ";-*iW
Business became brisk after ' the
third event. J. B. Smith of Chicago,
formerly connected with M. D. Miller,
bid up The Lady Rohesia from $400 to
J9OO, and Jim Curl let the mare \ go.
Then Jim Neil, owner of Ethel Abbott,
claimed Watercure from T. A. Davies
for $725. Jim had only been the owner
of Watercure about three and a half
minutes, when Steve Judge offered him
$1000 for his bargain, and the old geld
ing again changed owners.
Four pounds and Jockey McÃride
â¢worked a decided change in the speed
of Christine A. Last Monday Knapp
rode the mare and ; thought he could
have won with more luck at the start.
. Bob Fleming, one of Joe Rose's con
fidential men, renewed his acquaint
ance with fhe game at Oakland. Bob
reached here Tuesday night from New
York and may cut In if things look
good to him. He says "English' Bill".
Jackman crossed over to dear <Ud Lun
non, where he will replenish his stock
of waistcoats before returning to Cali
fornia.
Alton Odom, the well-known handi
capper and keen judge of prices. Is a
fresh arrival in turf circles. Alton has
been associated with Joe Yeager and
all of the big bookmakers In the coun
try.
Melodious ran such a quiet race in
the fifth.recJtal that it was supposed
Joe Quirilah's \u25a0 mare . would escape the
halter brigade. Not so, however. Zlck
Abratns, owner of Miller's Daughter.

Attell Gets Draw Decision.
BALTIMORE. Nov. 23.â Kid Sullivan
of Washington and Abe Attell of San
Francisco met in a flfteen-r<>und box
ing bout to-night before thÂ« Eureka
Athletic Club. It was whispered at the
ringside that immediately before the
meeting Attell insisted upon its being
called a draw if both .men were on
their feet at the close of tho fifteenth
round. His only effort seemed to be to
prolong, the fight to that point. He
succeeded and Referee O'Hara held up
the hands of both .men. Throughout
the match Attell used practically one
blow, a left Jab. that never landed hard
enough to make Sullivan angry. The
only other features of the mill were the
fondness for clinches to; avoid punish
ment and footwork that their admirers
called magnificent. Others dubbed It
a sprinting match. Sullivan did about
all the fighting and inflicted a good
deal of punishment.

Sporting Men Do NqJSeem to Figure Sullivan
i a Chance : Against the Lowell Boxer.
.The shadow, of Jimmy. Gardner has en
tirely eclipsed Mike (Twin) Sullivan in'the
eyes 'of the betting men.' The Lowell
boxer remains a strong 6 to lOJcholce'for
their .fight' in Woodward's "Pavilion to
night before the Hayes .Valley Club, with
but little Sulllvan : - money In sight. . The
men who string with Gardner, finding but
little! action for -their, "money In the
straight betting, J. took ; to wagering' last
night on the number of rounds the affair
would last. v -They, offered - even -money
that Gardner, would win in fifteen rounds.
Gardner has shown feo ; much * class | In : his
two fights ; here that |aj hlghjestimate has
been-placed on his -boxing ; ability. His
fight with Turner should be thrown out,
as It is generally, understood the Stockton
man was ; not ! trying (on that occasion.
While the betting "1Â»- an Indication that
many believe Gardner ; will be an easy
winner, . there are other followers of . the
game who figure Sullivan will give him
one of : the * hardest fights in his career.
They think the ' actual .contest will , show
that. the, price' ls* a' false one.- If Joe'Gans.
has not gone back Sullivan's recent show
ing with him stamps" him as a dangerous
opponent for any. man near.' his .weight;
Aside from the division of 75 and 25 per
cent In : the boxers', share of | the gate .re
ceipts,'there is a side wager, still standing
of $1000 each which will goto the winner.
As Sullivan \u25a0 Is , finding ; his : own side . bet

CLERK RIORDAN
IS DISCHARGED
Judge Heacock Declares Him
Guiltless of :\u25a0 -"Any^; Offense
Against United States Law
MAKES A STATEMENT
Says He Sold Blanks to
Martinho, Believing They
Were for IJs'e in Portugal
Deputy CountjvClerk Joseph Riordan
was discharged yesterday by. United
States' Commissioner. -Heacock, \ who
found" that he was innocent of -the
crime of conspiracy charged .against
him. it was in. evidence that Kiordan
in his .'ofticial capacity had sold several
naturalization certificate blanks ; with
the seal of the Superior Court imprint
â¢ed thereon to Antonio Sousa Martinho;
that Martinho had given them to I An
tonio 'J." Santos; that Santos had filled
in .one of them with the nameof Joso
Ignacio Brazil as the naturalized one,
who was about to go to Portugal. Mar
tinho - testified that he had informed
Kiordan ' he ''.wanted -the blanks for the
purpose of sending them", to Portugal
by a man; who would have them filled
up so as to show, that this man was
an American -citizen, tho object being
to save . the two sons of this person
from beins drafted into the Portuguese
army.- - Â».
Clerk Riordan testified that he had
bpen employed as a \u25a0 deputy : county
clerk for ' eleven" years, and. that this
was the only occasion on which ho bad
sold riny naturalization blanks. He dM
so upon' ;. Martinho's statement that
they were . to be used": in Portugal for
the purpose stated. He admitted that
Martinho , had paid" him 14 for/the
blanks with the golden seal of' the
court attached.^ \u25a0{
Bort j Schlesinger, counsel for Rlor
dan, argued that an offense. of that kind
against the laws and the King of Por
tugal was not an offense against the
United States law. He quoted many
authorities, to sustain his contention.
'-/./ Judge 'llencouk remarked that the
only evidence connecting Riordan with
the affair was that Riordan had sold
the blanks to Martinho for the purpose
stated. He therefore dismissed the
case.
CONSIDERS ORDINANCES
REGULATING ALL SIGNS
Supervisor*' Committee Hears)' Repre
sentative of Mcrcbnntn' Association -
' About Electrical Construction.
The Supervisors" joint committoe on
Electricity and Fire yesterday had un
der . consideration ., the \u25a0 proposed ordi
nance regulating the/use of signs on
roofs, walla and cornices of buildings
submitted by the Merchants' Associa
tion, the Fire Department and Depart
ment of Electricity. L,. M. King, secre
tary of the Merchants' Association,
stated that the ordinance is designed to
secure the safety of members of the
Fire Department, and to be fair with
those^owning; signs already erected. T.
H. B. " Varney, of Varney & Green,
objected to limiting the signs on roofs
to a height of six feet, claiming that
a sign ten feet high__could be made
perfectly "safe. \u25a0 King held tliat any
sign' more than six feet high on roofs
is dangerous. F. V. Meyers, represent
ing the electrical sign contractors, said
they had no objection' to increasing the
height to ten feet. ; After \ King 1 had
read a summary of the covered
by, the" ordinance the committee took
the matter under advisement.
Similar â¢action was taken on ~a pro
posed amendment to the ordinance reg
ulating electrical signs submitted by
the Merchants' Association so as to re
quire the sign to be entirely of electric
lights on a frame work. 8. E. Shelley,
representing a sign company, stated
that.its signs were transparent but not
enclosed and asked the same privilege
as given to incandescent electric light
signs. . King objected to any change
in the I ordinance requiring all letters
on swinging signs to be composed en
tirely of incandescent lights. The com
mittee, postponed action on both ordi
nances \u25a0 until next Monday.
Tub Wizard Case Settled.
In. the matter of Albert Meyer and
John Beatge of the firm of Albert Meyer
& Co. vs. the tug Wizard Judge de
Haven I yesterday filed a decision to the
effect that Franklin P. Bull had equit
able title to^ the tug; that; Ernst Held
raaier '.was entitled to receive % 3000 -of
the proceeds of the sale of the tug, with
interest at 6 per cent for one year and
eleven days,' together with costs and
proctor's fees, and that' the remainder
should go to Bull.

cupied much of the session in : ; making
suggestions and discussing propositions
which : he thought ought to be 'incorpor

These j suggestions \u25a0 ; were numerous and
would mean -a -lengthy measure aside

proposition, but Intends to present it later
in some modified form, so that there may
be /freer; traffic between -railroads. .
One particular point made by' ; Senator

to afford better, facilities to lateral lines
and small roads which are compelled- to
use big roads ' to reach a market. The
better management of the -private car

pers, ; and . amendment of ; the laws bear
ing, on'.termihal companies and terminal
charges also were 'suggested, v.'-f." . .." '
There was a great deal of talk by _bther
members of the committee and during-the
afternoon the Esch-Townsend bill was up
for comment. It did not seem likely that
this measure would be made the basis of
action by the committee, as several mem
bers have made drafts of measures which
'they will present for consideration. The
committee' will \ meet, again . to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock.

BRANCH'S DEATH
DUE TO BLOWS
Physicians Give Testimony
in the Trial Growing Out
ot the Annapolis Tragedy
-ANNAPOLIS, Md., Nov. 23.â The prose

of; medical'testimony during to-day's ses
sion, of the: court-martial which is trying
Midshipman v Meriwether .for manslaugh
ter,; in connection with the' death of Mid
shipman Branch. ' The : Important .wit
nesses to-day were Dr. J. M. T. Finney,
chief surgeon.'of the Johns Hopkins Uni
versity oi[ Baltimore; I Dr. - Henry â¢" M.
Thomas, neurologist \ of : . the same^ insti
tution,, and Surgeon .J. C. Byrnes, :- the
chief medical officer attached to the Na
val Xcademy." ! : ,
; The operation upon Midshipman Branch,
consisting of lifting and folding over a
portion of the skull in order to remove
such blood clots as might be formed,- was
performed by: Dr. Finney. Dr. Thomas,
the specialist in that: line, came to An
napolis at . Dr.; Finney's request In order
to : locate from the i symptoms the proper
place for the operation. Dr. Byrnes was
called in ; consultation -. with Dr. Stone
shortly after Branch I had been brought
to' the hospital. Much testimony of a
deeply interesting, -though sometimes
technical character was \u25a0 given .by the
medical: men. \u25a0'.'
'"All< the\ medical' officers gave it as their
very positive conviction that Branch died
from , the effect of blows ha had received
In his fight with . Meriwether. They be
littled any: possible effect of the : treat
ment Brancfi received after .the fight and
gave it as their opinion that nb treatment
could have saved his life. The' absence
of an autopsy was explained by" Surgeon
Byrnes; who stated \u25a0. that Branch's fathei
refused his permission. -
The prosecution will 'close its testimony
early to-morrow. â¢ ."...',
Midshipman A. M.: Fitch, the referee of
the Meriwether-Branch fight, who admits
to acting as j referee in nineteen similar
encounters, waj questioned as to the
gloves c which .were used in the fight at
the I academy. These gloves are used to
protect the hands when [ punching the
bag, but Fitch said that there | was "no
regulation, as 'far as he knew, against
their use in the friendly boxing matches
at the academy gymnasium. He also said
that ha had 'never seen them so used. In
answer to a, question by a member of the
court, Fitch said that he believed gloves
used at " regular prize fights weighed
about three ounces.
Dr. Stone' said In his testimony that
Branch came under, his care at the hos
pital at about half past morn
ing. Branch was absolutely unconscious,
he said; the left side of his head, the
left temple,. his forearms, right eye and
lips were much "swollen and discolored,
and both eyes were closed. ; .\When the
eyelids were opend with the hand, the
eyes rolled and generally set towards the
left, a The left arm and leg were para
lyzed and there was a -convulsive move
ment in- the right arm and leg. There
was slight fever, but the pulse was nor

The witness, said that he realized that
Branch's condition" was very serious and
called Dr. Byrnes,; chief surgeon at the
academy! into consultation. Drs. - Finney
and Thompson of Baltimore arrived dur
ing the day, and. with the consent of
Branch's father; an exploratory opera
tion was determined upon. . '
.From the symptoms and what was dis
closed ; during the operation Dr. Stone
was confident that the condition had been
brought about by. external Injuries to the
head, such as might have been caused by
blows of the fist. These blows could
have been Inflicted on either side of the

â¢who ha.i bought on the etrength of them were
Â«-aslÂ«- thrown into apprehension upon their dc
r.taJ. A bad effect upon Â«entimest was pro
tfuceil also by the evidence of a lack of support
in the Rock Island group and the rapid deoiine
in prices th*re under light llcjuldation. Ru*
Oiora circulated that there was to be no divi
dend paid on the second preferred stock of the
St. Louis ar.d San Francisco Railroad Com
psny. which Â«~u -<he we&kest rtock in the
srrovp. The >".\u25a0. r.:al of this, rumor had little
immediate effect In rallying the stock. During
the n. rr.;nK period of westicaess the Sletropo:i
tan tracttoa Mocks showed notable etrengih
afalnFt the current of " the market sad t!i?y
wer* joined before the rer.eral market raliled
by the United States Rubber stocks and the
istcmaUonai Paper etocks. It was not, how
ever, until the enormous 6etnaad for Union
Pacific dt-velcped that any effective resistance
\u25a0was cK^red to the g-eneral weafcx-is of the
market. The character of the dealings in
T'nicn PacJHc stamped everj'where easily Â»Â« of
highly c&Etralized origin and the favorable
\iew cf the movcnieiit was that the. demand
v&s frora inside sc-tirces based on knowiedge of
tile character oi tht annual report, the publica
tion of which 1b looked lor to-morrow. Re
ports were circulated that the dlspoeiticn of
the company's Northern Securities as disclosed
In the rejxjrt showed such large profits as to
Justify the nioveraent. The view of the move
rr.rrt ac of speculative origin fou&S encourage
n.ent in the fact that the operations in the
stock were on a very large scale on the part
cf the same operators who conducted the ie
cent taoveiaeni In Eeadir.g. A wager was of
fered Irota U:te source that Union Pacific was
de&Uned to leach 175 on tie movement. In ex
actly the fame manner that a wnger was made
early In the Re&dir.g movement as to its ulti
mate high price. There was no notable change
tn actusl conditions. Price* of Iroa aad stÂ«l,
according to trade authorities, are held down
enly by main force. The sale of $12.W0,000 of
New York City bond* did not ruffle the tran
culllity of the market. Foreign exchaege alÂ«o
'was ateady aad discounts la London were
X.:cwer. The price of cepper was lifted to the
*\Â£lgbeÂ»t leTel touched, since 1901. The dletri
bwilon of an tnstallmeat of the deferred divi
dend 00 Republic Eteel preferred waa kne-wa
for the first time to the market. The 'Unlt-?d
States Steel stocks and St. Paul obtained most
â¢sbataatial benefits -frcm. the Union Paotfic
niovement, but the earlier losses were pretty
well restored tn the general list. The stocks
uaflÂ«r special pressure, however, continued
weak and cade the lowest prices of the day
la the last few mitretts of the market, thus

very favorable report Daly West was bid up
yesterday, aad tips were freely spread to buy it.
This morning New York came in as a. heavy
peller anil ailed all the buying' orders : and
offered the stock down to $20 soon after the
opening. North Butte held flrm, but showed
no' feature of support; The buying and selling
both became scattered. The Lake, properties
are still dull but strong and a revival of in
terest is bound to occur.
The Chlc2gx> Chronicle says: The 75c divi
dend on North Butte compares with 50c de
clared thiee months -ago. Statemtnts have
been j made to the effect that the company's
copper wa* costing . between 6%c to s&c a
pound. This Is a trifle low. Tile actual cost
is between 6c and 6UÂ«- The October
earnings were $290,000. The active Â«tope \u25a0In
Edith May is now actually 900 feet in length.
Pittsburg has bÂ»en the recent seller of North
Butte. President Corey of the United States
Steed Corporation has a large following in
Plttsburg. and when ' the stock was selling
around 160 per share he told his* friend* there
that It wculd sell between $eo -and $70. His
friends have sold the stock above $60. al
thouxh Mr. Corey tÂ« understood to have his
orlginial holdings intact. The Pittsburg sell-
In? has now cease-j. â¢ -*

NEW YORK. Nov. 23.â Trading was en an
extensive scale and there was good buying and
the market a Jvarced 4o points. - The exports
are some 75.UU0 bales behind those of this date
last year, but operators, look for an increase
from now on. aa well aa the movement to tail
oSf. The New York Commercial estimates the
crop at 10.31m}, 492 bales, which caused a bullish
feeling. The season Is ! approaching ijs close
and every reliable report shows that this crop
is much below the normal.' The market to-day
showed noteworthy strength.
Sentiment seemn to be ftwnewhat reactionary,
and if surface indications are to be trusted
ecveral powerful spot interests that have been
the mainstay of the bull side are now working
for a decline. ThÂ« : market is believed to be

JINGLE OF COIN CALLS
IN A MOB OF LAWYERS
Negro's Dollar Is the
Signal for a
Charge.
Legal Lights Make a
Sudden Dash
Everything Else Is
Left When Money
~P office
It was the dull hour at tha Hall of
Justice yesterday. Most of thÂ« Police
Court attorneys had adjourned to resorts
adjoining, the Hall. Judge Megan was
preparing to relax his dignity and Judge
Cabaniss was finishing up the cases in
Judge Conlan's court. The day's excite
ment was over apparently.
Suddenly there was a wild commotion.
Restaurants and cafes around tha hall
began to epew up Police Court lawyers.
From all sides they appeared and
charged down on the building. Down In
the detectives' room the sleuths pricked
up their ears.
Somewhere Inside the hall a coin was
Jingling emphatically. Glasses were left
half emptied, pretzels were dropped at
the lunch counters and flapjacks, pre
pared for tha daughter, were left un
touched.
One attorney, who carried weight, got
caught In the door Jamb. The others
piled over him. They choked the eleva
tors and blocked the stairways. Woe to
him who went down in the mad ! stam
pede.
"It's mine; I heard it first," was the
cry as the heavy brigade of lawyers
charged into Conlan's court, where Judge
Cabaniss was hearing the case of Frank
Evans, a "cullud gent" charged with vag
rancy.
"Have you any friends who can testify
as to your good character?" his Honor
had asked.
. Evans reached into his pocket and
produced a dollar. He dropped it down
upon a table with a jingle. "Heahs ma
friend," he said.
That was the signal for the charge of
the attorneys. They poured into rf the
courtroom in a tangle of arms and legs.
Five seconds after the dollar struck the
table, there was not even standing room.
"Some one signaled for an attorney,"
one of the legal lights explained.
"Ah don't want no lawyer, yo' Hon
nah," said Evans. "Ah ain't guilty."
Slowly and sadly the disconsolate legal
lights melted away. Out In the corridors
they held an indignation meeting. "What
did he want to give the, signal for If he
did not want an attorney?" was the point
-raised.
A few. minutes later Evans tripped
blithely out of the courtroom. .. He had
been acquitted. He was still fondling the
dollar and he hummed softly. "Put your
hand on your pocket-book and loudly 'cry
'Here's ma frien'." â¢
In disposing of a saloon at 3177 Mission
street, Thomas Dunne sold with It eleven
bottles of boozeless â¢ whisky. Michael
Barry, the purchaser, when he uncorked
one of the vessels and found it filled with
vacancy was naturally Indignant and had
Dunne arrested for obtaining money un
der false pretenses. .
"I am a very honorable man," declared
Dunne before Judge Mogan. "He bought
the place with his eyes open." .
"But you didn't tell him that the bottles
were empty, did you?" asked Judge Mo
gan. -
"N. 0," admitted Dunne. "But X am a
very honorable man."
"I don't think that you were a very
honorable man on that occasion," ob
served Judge Mogan. "But you can be
the next beet thing by paying the differ
ence.- Give back tha \u25a0 money you got for
the empty bottles and we'll admit that you
are an honorable man."
"A very honorable man," ' Insisted
Dunne.
\ "No, it's a little too late for that now,"
said hit Honor. "You lost the chance to
be a very honorable man, but we'll call
you a plain, everyday honorable man if
you make restitution."
Dunne produced the coin and was raised
to that status. ;â¢";

Terry attitude.
"You are charred with^ being drunk,",
his Honor said. \ .
"Dr-r-r-unk, ha ha," -said Mary. "Some
more of Sarah Bernhardt's spite! Sho
hounded ma. from. She would
hound ma from here.. She. knows that. if
I were given an oppertunity to tread the
boards once more that she 'would have
to supe' for ma."
"Sarah Bernhardt hadÂ«.nothing to do
with it," objected Judge Cabaniss. ."It
was a policeman who made the charge."
"Ha, ha! He called ma drunk. It was
ma plays that" made ma drunk. It was
damned spot. Ha, ha! ,
"What's the matter with this woman?"
demanded Judge Cabanlss.
"I have heart trouble," volunteered the
actress. "I am in need of a little stimu
lant. If I do not get it I will die. \%Vould
you murder ma?" ' ' \u0084 '
"Don't . die here." pleaded Judge
Cabaniss. \ "If you insist upon dying,
please do it somewhere else. Go wher
ever you want to."
Bernhardt's rival arose and departed
in silent majesty.
The proceedings in Judge Mogan's court
early in the morning were interrupted by
soft and plaintive strains of music. At
times the -air was slow and mournful;
lattr it would rise to a shrill wail of
grief.
The bailiff' sternly rapped for order, but
the music continued. The bailiff walked
down the aisles, eyeing the court hang T
ers-on suspiciously. Finally he made his
way to the dock, where Cornelius Dunn,'
charged with vagrancy, was airing his
wealth of whiskers near the open win
dow.
- The mysterious music was more clear in
his neighborhood.
"Have you a phonograph or a hand
organ in your pocket?" demanded the
bailiff. â¢
Dunn denied the accusation. Suddenly
a light dawned upon . the. bailiff. He
walked over and closed the window. In
stantly the plaintive . music ceased. The
wealth of whiskers worn by Dunn, tossed
about by the breeze, had made an Aeolian
harp effect.
This musical acquisition of Dunn has
been the cause of his downfall. For weeks
he has been haunting the Marine Hospi
tal, sleeping out under trees, while the
winds played nocturnes -In his whiskers.
Patients and attendants at the hospital
have been kept awake by these concerts.
From sunset to sunrise Dunn would give
recitals on his hairy Aeolian harp. *He
was in the midst of a touching serenade
when Policeman Guest \u25a0"' swooped down
upon him and gathered him in.
Upon promise to take himself and his
orchestral whiskers to some other neigh
borhood Dunn was dismissed.
John Culbert, a negro,' charged with va
grancy, pleaded with JudgeCabaniss to be
let go, as he was an ex-soldier and had
served his country faithfully. He pro
duped papers to prove it.
"Were you ever wounded?" asked the
'Judge.
"No, Ah can't say that. Ah was.; sah;
but, ,to tell the honnes' truf. your Hon
nah, Ah was half shot once or twice.
But Ah'll never get into dat kind ob dan
ger again if you let; me go, sah."
Judge Cabaniss accepted the promise
for what It. was- worth and the veteran
;was dismissed. ' â¢'â¢X' 6 " -

Avers He WWars r Divorced
ajid Hints at Conspiracy
Mra. . Ella 1 - Amy. of . Littleton. . Mass.,
swore. to a. warrant before Police Judge'
Cabaniss yesterday, afternoon; oharginff
Winfleld Scott-: Amy. a wealthy
miner, with bigamy. The woman, who
has; long Bince passed the middle, age,
recites a tale "that carries with; lt__a
tinge of -romance and rings with ;a
sound of pity as well as fiction. -;*. r ~'4
According to; the. woman's strange
tale, she was married to Amy. in her
native town of Littleton in : 1873 1 and
has a daughter by him. " She says they
came' to live in this city, where- her
spouse worked as a truck driver, and
bliss and happiness was theirs till the
wife was taken sick.
. Mrs. Amy avers that her husband sent
her and her, child back-to Littleton and
for, a', few years contributed to \ their
support. .'\u25a0;. But these contributions soon
faded away, she says, and she. "was
forced to earn a' living ; for. herself and
her daughter, hearing no more from her
husband.' . -
Mrs. Amy then 1 goes on to relate how
her j husband :. made a tripj. East about
three years ago to bond some valuable
copper jpines. She says she started an
investigation ' and discovered he_"had
been married In 1889 to Miss :. Carrie
Sporry in * Stockton, though. \u25a0 according
to her tale, I . he never went through' the
formality of a divorce from her. ;\u25a0?Â£
AM NOT AT HOME.
Mrs.- Amy says she strove and strug
gled and finally saved;up enough money
to'come to this city about two weeks
ago. V' She claims to, have had all her
suspicions verified during those last
days, having watched the register at
the Occidental Hotel and seeing there
the names of Amy and his Stockton
wife..
- Mrs. Amy says she also discovered
that her husband had adopted a daugh
ter and was rearing her as a lady with
all; the luxuries that money was capable
of buying. In the meantime, Mrs. Amy
says, her own child was in straitened
circumstances until some time ago,
when she was married. ' Mrs. Amy says
her daughter is 32 years old.
"Amy: lived in Stockton for a number
of years. Some time ago. he went to
Alaska and' there managed to locate
some valuable copper, mines -near
Valdez. These netted- him a fortune
and he is said to be known as the
"l^ing" in the frozen regions of ,â¢ the
north. v
; The police yesterday learned, ; that
Amy had left Stockton in the s morning
and it is "their belief he has started for
Seattle. All the towns en] route" have
been wired and it Is likely the miner
will be. taken into custody.soon. ; .â¢ ''â¢

STOCKTON. Nov. 23.~Wheri seen to

charge against;- her husband | came g as | a
great shock to her. He; left here.Tuesday
evening for San Francisco, where , he was
to close a deal for the sale of a mine.
Mrs. Amy : believes ] the L * charge : waÃ In
spired by spite. He has been' mining in
Alaska for several years with' Indifferent
results, but j this year '.struck |it rich. In
Stockton Mrs. '.Amy was married to* him
in 1889 and the relations of the two have
been pleasant. She says she knew he had
been married bef ore,"but that he was di
vorced, z* That there ] was no secret about
his last marriage was evident from the
fact that .- Mrs. Amy has corresponded
with his daughter by a former wife. - Tms
evening she declared she was too shocked
to understand J the situation, but she re
fused to believe that her. husband had
deceived her in regard to his % divorced
Shev ventured the opinion that Amy's
prospects from i the sale of ; a' mine had
Inspired his former wife to begin a ac
tion against him. She says ; Amy tele
phoned last night \u25a0; that -he would not be
home, but she supposed .business was de
taining him."> Mrs. Amy Is a woman . high
ly spoken of by friends and acquaintances
and her manner I was that of a' well bred
woman , in deep distress . over her .hus
band's plight. ' \u25a0;;.*\u25a0
