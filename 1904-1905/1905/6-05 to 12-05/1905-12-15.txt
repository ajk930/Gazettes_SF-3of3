Changed.

Given at Outer

If Request Is Denied There
May Be a Walking-Out
of Employes.
The onsen of San Francisco have
taJsen a decided Btsuic against the new
-^*chedulÂ« lcstHuted by Manager Chap
?r.aa cf tfce United Railroads. At a meet
ing held last right, at Eagle Hall, they
passed resolutions requesting the United
H.4lroads to issue a new time table al
. ring five minutes" lay-off at each outer
-. : minus.
'- he men came to the meeting fresh
:r 3i their cars and tile vexations of the
r.ew schedule. They were in a vigorous
Elate cf mind, end President Cornelius
said that, in their present temper, he
coj'3 not vouch for their conduct should
the l-equpst be denied. He inferred that
ihey mieht Etrike.
There were 300 men at the meeting. They
came in platoons as their runs ended,
and ir.any left in the same way during
the evening for their night runs. There
*Â»re SBOO men employed by the United Rail
, roads, but en eceour.t of the diversity of
hours at which the men work an atiend
cÂ»& nt itfs ,*s -<eftÂ£iAÂ«r<3f is. -good ~oce.-,The
citn" eeeir-ed grim, determined and very ;
mi^ch irritated by the strain put upon
thtm by the new runs.
Their grievance is that the new time
table makes the conditions under which
â¢..hey work intolerable. The new schedule
la an attempt to keep the same headway
between cars with a less number of cars
or. each route. This is done by reducing
t^-.e time allowed the motorman on his
r'-ute and the time of lay-oSC at the ter
minals. The result, the men say, is to
practically abolish what little time they
had formerly ax the ends of their runs,
to force them to rush their cars along
regardless of the comforts or necessities
of the public, end to keep them in a con
f-'az.i state of nervous tension.
They were free in the expression of
tl cir opinions of this state of things last
y. ght. A motorman of the Suiter-street
. r.e told of having worked his car stead
ily for seven hours without a second at
fejiy of the terminals to get off. The mo
tormen of the Kearny-street line said that
They found It absolutely impossible to keep
to their schedule. On the Ellis-street line
conditions are so bad, a conductor said,
that cars had to be started without glv
ir.g passengers a safe time to get on or
cfi. All of tfce men declared themselves
harassed to nervous prostration by the
jressure of time.
The acceptance by the United Bail
. roads of the request framed last night,
tr ; Â« men said, will remedy this state of
e^airs. The five minutes' lay -off at the
esa cf each round trip will not only give
ths time necessary for rest and decency,
but will also make the running time more
Â«iastic, thus enabling the cer crews to
give more attention to the taking on and
cif of the passengers.
President Cornelius of the Carmen's
Union was sanguine In his confidence that
the request would be granted?*" He said,
however, that if it were not granted, con
sidering the present temper of the men,
fee could not exewer for anything. "And
if they refused to work under the pres
ent conditions," he added, '"and 1 had the
power to persuade them to keep at work
1 would not do it. It would be unkind
ness for me to do bo."
Tee resolutions passed will be presented
to the representative of the United Rail
; ads to-morrow.

BARON WANTS
PENSION FROM
WIFE'S FATHER
Objects to His Treat
ment by Cleveland
Millionaire.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Dec 14,â "1 cannot
work. I have not been brought up that
way. I got $40 a week from my wife, but
what is that for a gentleman to live on?"
This was the statement made to-n!gnt
by Baron Max Zigf ried yon Schweidler
Schwartrenburg, who. separated from his
wife, formerly Miss Julia Keidel. daugh
ter of Phil J. Keidel. the Cleveland mil
lionaire, has come to this city to demand
his rights. H e wanta Keidel to support
him in a manner befitting- his station.
The Baron says he married Miss Ke'idel
In New York nine years # ago, having met
her while she was traveling in Europe
with her parents. \u25a0
"After the marriage xnjr wife and I went
abroad," he said. "My father-in-law al
lowed us all the money we needed during
the first year. We spent considerable
time in Paris and Monte Carlo. I recall
now, aa I speak of it, that I lost $12,000
in the Casino while there. But that was
a mere bagatelle. You seÂ©, I had always
thought that Americans who wanted
titles were willing to pay for them. I
know titles only reasonably good that
have brought big money. I figured that
mine was worth millions. For this rea
son I was willing to sacrifice all my in
terests in my family estate. In all these
nine years I have been allowed only
$220,000 by my father-in-law." *
The Baron is living in a rooming
house. The separation between his wife
and himself took place about a year ago.
They were living in Nevf York then. Be
cause they had no money. ; he said, his
wife and their two children returned to
her father's home.' .:. â¢'
The Baron says hÂ« is a ! lieutenant in

TWO STATES
FROM FOUR
TERRITORIES
Advocates of Joint
Admission Are
Victorious.
Caucus of House Repub
licans Takes Final
Action.
Measure Adding Two Stars
to Flag Will Be Passed at
This Session.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.â The Repub
lican members of the House, in caucus
to-day, unanimously declared In fa\%r of
admitting: Oklahoma and the Indian Ter
ritory as one State, and by a vote of 110
to 65 declared in favor of admitting Ari
zona and New Mexico as one State. Both
statehood questions' are to be contained
In one bill.
The conference which resulted In this
action took place Immediately at the con
clusion of the House session and occupied
an hour and a half. The opposition to
the programme was directed against the
Joining of Arizona and New Mexico, and
It Is understood that Adams of Wisconsin
and Tawney of Minnesota were the only
speakers on this side.
The programme of the leaders was pre
sented at the outset by Hamilton, chair
man of the Committee on 1 Territories, in
a resolution which he offered. It declared'
it to be the sense of the conference that
one State be made- of Oklahoma and the
.lndJan: r TerritQry-and^dhÂ«*State- of 'Ari
zona and-New Mexico," and that the Com
mittee on Territories be "" ; requested to
formulate this plan in one bill."
The Hamilton bill, already introduced,
contains the necessary provisions to meet
this Dlan and undoubtedly will be the
measure reported by the committee.
Hearings on this bill. the question of
embodying a constitutional amendment
prohibiting the sale of liquor In the two
Territories, were begun to-day. Aside
from. this question the bill is practically
in shape to be reported. The liquor hear
ings will not be hurried, and the plan
now Eeems to be to delay reporting the
bill until after the holiday recess. When
It is reported a rule will be brought in
for Its immediate consideration â¢ by tfie
House.
The conference had not proceeded long
when the debate was limited to flve-min
ute speeches, and this action caused com
plaint by those opposing the admission of
New Mexico, and Arizona.
Speaker Cannon took the floor and
spoke vigorously for .the two-State plan.
After' Adams and Tawney had opposed it,
Grosvenor of Ohio took the opportunity
to read a number of newspaper clippings
giving an account of what he termed a
"junket" which a number of members of
the House had taken through the Terri
tories' last summer, at which time they
had publicly stated they would oppose the
admission jointly of Arizona and New
Mexico.

CLARK PAYS
$1,750,000
FOR A MINE
MontananÃuysthe
Union in El
Dorado.
First Payment Is Made
on Property and Deeds
Are Recorded.
Famous Gold Producer Is Now
Owned by Millionaire
Senator.
Ececlal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 14.â Through Los
Angeles men who have mining interests
in El Dorado County the news has been
received here that Senator W. A. Clark
of Montana has- purchased the famous
jUnlon mine on the "mother lode" in that
great mining center. The first papers
have been exchanged,- the first money
paid and If reports be true the transfer
has been regularly recorded at Placer
vllle. The purchase price was $1,730,000,
but' the manner in which payments are
to be made, and when, has not been made
public.
The authority ' for the information is
Phil Larkin, owner of the famous Larkln
mine, a short distance from the Union.
The Union Is one of tue best-known
mining properties in the West. It- was
formerly, owned by Alvinza Hayward and
Charles D. Lane of . San Francisco, who
worked it *to the ' 1400^foot level," ' taking
out immense quantities of bullion. Tha
story of how the vein was lost, how Hay ;
ward, who was a spiritualist, took the
advice of a medium and sold his interest
for a mere trifle, and how the new owners
went deeper and struck richer ore than
the original owners had even dreamed of.
Is part of the mining history of the
State. .
The fifty-stamp mill at the Union was
destroyed by fire on November 4, and has
not been rebuilt and since the fire the
mine has not been worked to its full ca
pacity. Eight months ago the Standard
Oil people offered $1,250,000 for the Union
property, but the offer was declined.
The first intimation that the Montana
Senator was looking at the property came
during his last visit to this State, when
the announcement was made that some
of his experts were examining gold prop
erties in the northern part of the State,
but no particular attÂ© ntion was paid to
the matter. *'
Now comes the statement from an au
thority which here is considered the best
that Senator Clark first offered $1,500,000
and the owners wanted $2,000,000, and that
the final price was a compromise.

bill and when it adjourned the bill was
Ftill ur.der consideration. There were set
speeches hy Teller, Scott and Morgan
and they were followed by a general de
bate, in which - all phases of the con

<!iiÂ«stioa of salaries, the control of the
Panama Railroad and the necessity for

canal legislation and that the status of
the Panama Railroad should be made the
subject of legislation. - \u25a0

GETS BIG GIFT
Handsome Present of Forty
Thousand Dollars Goes
Toward Endowment Fund
At the seventh annual meeting of the

street, near Twenty-fourth, it transpired
that the munificent sum of 140,000 had
been given, to Mills College by a mem
ber of the Rev. Dr. George C. Adams'
congregation.
The secret was let out in the course of
the reports on churches when it was
stated that the contributions at the First
Congregational Church for the year
amounted to $40,C00 and out of that hand
some sum $20,000 was fpr benevolent pur
poses. Besides that it was stated that
a member of the trustees of the church
had contributed $40,000 for educational
purposes, but the generous donor's name
was "withheld.
Later to a. Call representative Dr.
Adams said that he was not In a posi
tion to name the donor a.nd stated that
the first he knew of it was through the
Rev. Dr. Charles R. Brown, who made
the statement at the Congregational
ministers' meeting lately that such a
gift had been made by a member of Dr.
Adams' church.
It seemed" certain In the minds' of sev
eral present that the gift Â»-<vas made by
Edward Coleman, a conclusion in which
Dr. Adams joined. There is a step on
foot to procure $100,000 a year for ten
years with which to endow Mills College
and the sum just presented makes up
that amount for this year. â¢
There was a deal of business trans
acted and the reports showed that In
every Congregational church there had
been a remarkable growth and increase,
not only In membership, but also In the
Sunday schools.
The Rev. I. C. Meserve, D. D.. pastor
of Plymouth Church, was elected mod
erator and declared that never before
during the service â¢in the city had
stronger reports been made as to the
growth of his denomination.
The election on membership committee
resulted in the unanimous return of the
Rev. Benjamin Sargent, the Rev. . Joseph
Rowell, the Rev. T. R. Earle, the
Rev. Sidney R. Yarrow and Deacon B.
S. Hays. Dr. I. C. Meserve and the

"That "Kunning" ; and All
Such Practices at Goyem
inent School Must Cease
v WASHINGTON.. .Dec. H.T-Hazing of
every kind,- it was announced ' to-day,
would be stamped out pi the Naval Acad
emy, regardless pf the number of.dismiss
als from the brigade of midshipmen nec
essary to bring about this result. Two
midshipmen will be^ dismissed from the
academy within a few days by the Sec
retary of the Navy, one for hazing and
the other for countenancing It by failure
while on duty to report its occurrence.
Other "dismissals will follow as often as
midshipmen are found? guilty of hazing
or countenancing it.
Aroused .by the condition of \ affairs
which reports show to exist at the acad
emy so far as the treatment of fourth
class men is concerned, Secretary Bona
parte late this afternoon to
Rear Admiral James H. Sands, superin
tendent of the academy, a request to
coma to Washington .as soon as possible
for a conference. This conference will be
held to-morrow. It will be the initial step
in a new and vigorous campaign to be
waged at Annapolis against hazing.
Congressional investigations of the con
ditions at the academy have already been
proposed in a resolution introduced in
the House by Representative Loud of
Michigan.
DISMISSAL OF OFFENDERS.
Secretary Bonaparte to-day received an
official report from Admiral Sands ' an
nouncing the suspension of Midshipman
Trenmore Coffin Jr., third class man, for
hazing Midshipman Jerdone Pettus Xim A
brough, fourth clasa man, by forcing
him to stand on. his head until he be
came unconscious, and of Midshipman
Warren A. Vandervere, second classman,
because while on duty he observed the oc
currence and failed to report. The su
perintendent called attention to the fact
that Midshipmen Coffin and Vandervere
were guilty of violating a well-known
regulation of the academy, and recom
menced .their .summary dismissal in ac
cordance with an "act "of-Congress ap
proved March'3. l9o3.'â*"' "-
Secretary Bonaparte wishes to obtain
from the Attorney General an opinion
regarding certain' phases â¢ of the ,case
whicri, while exceedingly Important, will
not aifect, it Is understood, his final ac
tion approving the ; recommendation for
summary expulsion.
It wa9 learned from official sources to
day that the hazing of Kimbrough was
even more brutal than was first sup
posed, more dangerous in its results and
more blameworthy In its origin. He was
undoubtedly hazed because he testified,
under compulsion, before the investigation
board and implicated some of the upper
class men. For this he was threatened by
upper class men. who said that they
would kill him, and he la still under that
threat, it is said, repeated since the, oc
currence.
KIMBROUGH IS IMPROVING.
No secret was made at the Navy De
partment of the determination of the offi
cials to make short shrift of . hazing,
"running" and* alt" such practices at the
academy. If necessary, It is understood,
the President will be appealed to to veto
any bill that may be passed by Con
gress providing for the reinstatement of
a midshipman expelled for â¢ hazing or
countenancing it.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Dec. 14.âMidship
man Kimbrough was to-night reported
as' rapidly gaining strength and is in no
danger.
The condition of Midshipman Henry G.
Cooper Jr. is also improving. â¢
Admiral Sdnds will go fo Washington
to-morrow, to support his recommenda
tion of dismissal in the cases of Midship
man Trenmore Coffin Jr. and Midship
man Warren A. Vandevere. Dr. George
\V. Vandevere of Mount Holly, N. J.,
father of Midshipman Vandevere, does
ndt" regard the dismissal of his son as
just &r,h will tight it before the Secre
tary of the Navy and in case of failure
there probably before Congress. Naval
Academy authorities state that there
was no doubt of Vandevere's failure to
do. his duty and that if Kimbrough had
not received proper attention he would
probably have died.
The Investigating .board will continue
its work/ its powers having been en
larged.
MOUNT HOLLY. N. J., Dec. H.-Mid-
Ehipman Warren A. Vandevere, in, a let
ter to his parents received here to-day,
states that he was not on duty Tues
day night, at the time the hazing oc
curred at the Annapolis Naval. Academy,
for which his dismissal has been recom
mended by Admiral Sands.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
PANAMA, Dec. . 14.â The Standard Oil
Company "is. conquering new fields on the
isthmus and as a result the friction be
tween President Amador and Governor
General Magoon Is increasing.
The Standard, lollowing its policy of
securing all concessions that seem prom
ising, sent agents nere some time ago to
look over the -field: The .agents discov
ered that the Penama Railroad. Company,
operating under Its agreement with the
United . States Government, enjoyed a
monopoly of all carrying; along the'itsh
mus. . .
As* Governor' General " Magoon seemed
an uncompromising subject, the agents
for* the oil company proceeded to get into
touch with the President of Panama, and
it was announced to-day that the Stand
ard had succeeded in securing franchises
for the construction of dual pipe lines
across the isthmus, the first from Colon
to Panama and the second to connect
Bocos del Torro, on the Bay of Chiriqui,
with David, on the Pacific.
As evidence of the workings of the
Standard's agents, the concession was not
obtained directly in the name of the New
Jersey corporation, but in the name of
one fit its subsidiary companies, the
Union Oil Company of California. It was
obtained through the efforts ; of Senor
Jose Arango, chairman of the
Separatist Triumvirate, who arranged the
famous Panama revolution.
It is believed there will be a lively fight
between the Standard interests and Presi
dent Amador on one side and Chairman
Magoon and the American administration
on the other. /
Chairman Magoon disputes the right of
President Amador or any other official
of Panama granting any franchise to af
fect the canal strip, which was ceded to
the United States by treaty, and he is
likely to take energetic steps.

PLIES LASH
ON ADMIRER
OF DAUGHTER
Mrs. Sophie Schmidt of
Berkeley Severely Thrashes
William Kriske Before a
Crow<J. at Local Ferry Depot
SHOWS NO MERCY TO
SURPRISED VICTIM
Girl Makes Appointment and
Parent, Armed With Strap,
Goes to Meet Man She
Says Planned Abduction
If a sick friend asked you to deliver a
love letter to his sweetheart, whom he
had arranged for you to meet at a cer
tain place and particular hour, and if you
undertook the mission and met, besides
the fair young lady, her mother, armed
with a heavy steel-buckled strap,
wouldn't you wonder? And If. after the
mother had flogged you in the presence of
a large and unsympathetic multitude, two
big policemen had taken you to Jail and
charged you with disturbing the peace,
wouldn't you naturally feel that It Isn't
always safe to do the mercy act for a
disabled lover?
If you lack the imagination to place
yourself in the victim's place, just ask
William Kriske, who will be found this
morning in one of the city Police Courts,
making explanations to some Judge.
- There are some conflicting statements
concerning the case, but one fact is cer
tainâthat when Kriske appeared at the
Berkeley ferry yesterday afternoon about
3 o'clock to meet pretty Mies Sophie
Schmidt of Berkeley, Mrs. Sophia
Schmidt of Berkeley was also there with
a strap bearing a buckle at the end. and
she beat Kriske unmercifully before a
large and appreciative crowd that had no
occasion to cry "fake."
Kriske claims that he was only the
bearer of a note from a friend, Eddie Ha
denfeldt, who lay sick In a Berkeley hos
pital, to Miss Sophie, but > Mrs. Schmidt
says she believes Hadenfeldt was used as
a decoy. *
At any rate the mother learned from
her daughter that Kriske was to meet
the latter and she went along too.
Arrived at the ferry depot, here Mrs.
Schmidt told her troubles to Policeman
Hlghtower.
USES LASH VIGOROUSLY.
"Get a warrant for his \ arrest," ad
vised the patrolman.
"Not much," replied the Irate mother.
"I'll take the law In my own hands first,
with this to help me."
Here she produced the strap, to the
end of which plung the heavy steel
buckle. -
Just then Kriske sauntered along.
Crowds of suburbanites on their way
home from a campaign of Christmas
shopping . thronged the space in front of
the ferry depot, but Mrs. Schmidt and
her strap soon cleared a space within
which she administered to Kriske a
thrashing from which he tried In vain to
escape." Hemmed In by the crowd, he
could get no father away from Mrs.
Schmidt than the buckle-armored strap
would reach and Mrs. Schmidt's aim was
accurate.
Her aim was better than her wind, and
at the end of the first exciting 1 round the
woman was exhausted. Kriske wormed
his way through the crowd and landed
in the arms of Policemen Thomson and
Hlghtower, who took him to the Harbor
police station, charged him with dis
turbing the peace, and locked him up.
At 4 o'clock he was herded Into the
patrol wagon and, in company with the
day's accumulation of water-front drunks,
taken to the City Prison, where ho was
provided with quarters for the night.
There he made a etatment to the effect
that he was simply acting for Miss
Schmidt and Hadenfeldt. Kriske states
that he carried letters between the two
and claims that, although he knew what
the letters contained, the attack of the
girl's mother was unwarranted;
ENDBAUING MISSIVES.
In Krlske's possession was found a bun
dle of letters Miss Schmidt had written
to her invalid sweetheart. . Ail are
couched in endearing terms and one of
the envelopes contained her photograph.
Kriske explains his possession of the mis
sives. by saying that Hadenfeldt did not
degiro to keep them in the hosnital and
entrusted them to his care.
Mrs. Schmidt lies prostrated at her
home, 1625 Derby street, Berkeley, as the
result of her exciting experience in San
Francisco. She is a quiet, modest little
woman of sturdy German stock and
dreads the publicity that haa come
through the whipping she administered
to Kriske. She told her reasons as fol
lows: .
I gave Mr. Krlske a sound beatlnr. N I Blmply
had to dot H. lie was- trying to abduct my
daughter and there was no ot;Â«i ta. protect her
but myself. My hu9band Is unable to leave
the house. He la crippled with rheumatism
and I alone was left to deal with this man. It
was a hard task and I did not think I would
be able to carry out my purpose, but the
thought of this villain trylnsr to steal my little
girl from me gave me atrenxth. â¢ I wanted to
Kill the wretch. I beat htm with all my
strength, and when he begged ma for mercy
1 did not stop but kept striking him until the
police came and carried him off' to jail.
MOTHER ARRAIGNS KRISKE.
Sophie is only 13 years old. She will be 14
nex.t month, but she looks to be at least 13.'
She is large for her age and very pretty. Mr.
Kriske has been paying *Â«e n H Q ?, to k^ ?X
some time, -"He \u25a0Â« a worthless fellow but hla
mother. Mrs. Weishand, Is quite wealthy and
haa a large ranch In Petaluma. I warned him
to keep away from; rny house. He did not dare
to come here to ccc Sophie, "but be kept writ
ing her Utters, begging. her to run away with
Mna. He said he would give her fine Presents,
beautiful clothes and Jewelry, and Introduce
her to lots of nice people and girl* of her own
a*e He used every fiendish means he could
think of to lure her away from home..
Then he would wait for her at the corner,
and whenever she would go up to Ashby station
on errands for me KrUke would be there and
he would talk to her and tell her Â«f the fine
things he would give her If the would only do
as he wished. One day he introduced her to a
young man named Ed iHadenfeld. Hadenfeld
told the poor girl the same taleaot wealth and
pleasure that KrUke had pouredlnto her ear*
Their talk frightened Boohia, who la a very.
voumr Blrl. She did not know what it all
t meant Then she told me of her conversations
with the men. Whâ¬n I. Â«aw .the _ letters my
blood boiled.- *\u25a0 . ? "'- \u25a0
In the last letter v _KriÂ»ke. asked Sophie to
meet him in the ferry; building In San Fran

would, (to over together. But before we wtnt
I took my husband's heavy razor atrop with *
buckle on the end. when tee got to the ferry

was waiting for her. I rushed .up. and began
to beat htm. He cried "for mercy and by-
Btanders tried to Interfere. - but I * keDt bÂ«atlng
him. He cried that he did not write OÂ»a let
ters; that Hadenfeld had written them, but I
knew he lied. He tried to run away. Then I
cried "Stoo thief!", and the police came 'up
and- took charge of *tbe_ villain. "â¢ '
. Mrs.' Schmidt says she" does not* know
Krlake's \u25a0- friend Hadenfeld. She thinks
that Krlake used ; him simply as a decoy.

The party started from the' Courthouse
in four big automobiles to-day to inspect
the route of a proposed boulevard from
the city to the sea and once out of the
business section of the city they paid no
attention to the requirements of the ordi
nance which forbids more than fifteen
miles an hour speed. Two patrolmen

yelled at them to stop, but the officials
paid no attention to the order. Then the
policemen started after tbem and the
ohauffeurs of the officials, -thinking they
would be protected-, put on full speed.
There is not an automobile In the south
which can run faster than the special
motor cycles the city has provided for
the police, and after a chase of two milea
the automobiles were overhauled and
stopped. Then the Supervisors and others
told who they were, but that made no
difference. The policemen took their
names and made each of them, promise to

they would still have\to appear. That
settled it and the party proceeded at
greatly reduced speed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 15, ;1905.
Minister Takahira
Is Now on Way
to Japan.
Goes to His Native
Country for a
Vacation.
Minister Kogoro Takahira,
Japnn'M representative at
IVasbtnsrtoii, arrived lure yes
tcrrtn.v on lII* way to hln native
land. He goen oittcnslbly on
a vacation. He - talked lo
(iiinclotiNly on any | subject but
thone pertaining to mntters In
the land of the little brown
men. He said tbe war with
Rumsla v.n* a natural sequence
of affairs.
KcKardlnt; the matter of
Japnnese immigration, Minister
Tnkahira declined to irlve an
expression of opinion, and said
that ttvhn an affair for discus
sion between the two govern
ment*.
Kojfora Takahira, Japan's representa
tive at Waahlngton, is at the St. Francis.
He is on hfs way to his own Empire.
He is a diplomat in every sense of the
word, and^ appears to be a very wise
diplomat at that,^ especially when It
comes to talking much and saying as
little as he desires.
As he sat in his sumptuous apartments,
leaning back in a luxurious easy chair,
the while puffing a cigarette, he discussed
loquaciously on the general topics of the
day. While he was free of speech on
matters in general, he was "close
mouthed" on affairs that concern his
own country.
Referring to the war, he said that Ja
pan did not invite it. It came as a
natural sequence of events. Korea was
not able to maintain her national status
as an independent nation. She allowed
Russia, to interfere with the affairs of
the kingdom. The Emperor of Korea
was not independent. Japan's position
was a natural and logical consequence.
Regarding the reports that China was
intending to largely increase Its army,
Takahira said that China must be al
lowed to uphold her own people. It was
not the intention of Japan to dictate
anything to China.
Regarding the immigration of Japan
ese into this country, the wily diplomat
had only to say that all these matters
were left entirely to his Government for
discussion. He himself had no opinion
whatever to express upon the subject.
The question was one that must be dis
cussed between the two Governments.
When his Government had brought It
up to an Issue, it was possible then that
he might have something to say, but at
the moment he had no opinions to offer
on the subject.
The Japanese Minister said that he had
been in America for five yeara. His
Government had offered him a vacation
two and a half years ago, but affairs had
made it so he could not accept It then.
He was, however, now that the war was
over and peace restored, able to visit his
native land. He is going home now os
tensibly on a vacation. Whether he will
return or not he does not know.
He says he is very fond of America and
the Americans, but he was non-committal
as to whether he would prefer to go back
to Washington or to remain In Japan.
He has aged considerably since he came
to this country. His mustache, which 'was
Jet black when he came here, Is now
thickly sprinkled with gray. In speaking
of the poÃt at Washington, Takahira
said:
"This post will be regarded as one of
the highest in the whole diplomatic ser
vice of Japan, and It will be the greatest
ambition of any Japanese diplomat to be
sett here as the representative of the
Emperor. If, therefore, it should be my
fortune to be returned here again in that
capacity I will certainly consider it a
great honor and pleasure. Whoever is
appointed 'to this post will do all In his
power not only to maintain but to pro
mote the important relations growing be
tween the United States and Japan."
Regarding the settlements of the Trar
and its conditions, in which Takahira and
Baron Komura represented Japan and
Count de'Witte and Embassador de Rosen
represented Russia at Portsmouth, the
Minister had nothing to . say.
1 Takahira will sail to-morrow on the
steamship Manchuria for Yokohama.

OF AN AIRSHIP
Machine Becomes Unmanage
able When at Great Height
and Sails Into the Clouds
AERONAUT FACES DEATH
His Hands Chilled by Icy
Atmosphere and He Xearly
Falls From the Framework
CHICAGO, Dec. 14.â With the daring
of a man who faces death for the mere
excitement of it, Horace B. Wild, an
eictrician of Chicago, yesterday for the
first time in his life made a flight in
an airship. He soared to a height of
2ia>o feet above the ground.
After a series of thrilling: experiences
The- returned to the earth three miles from
where he started on his trip in a ma
chine which never had been tested be
fore. His flight was over Grand Cross-
Ing and was witnessed by hundreds of
spectators.
The trip through the air at the height
of half a mile was made under difficulty.
Wild's greatest peril was the danger of
losing his hold on the machine on ac
count, of the cold. Twice his numb fin
gers slipped from their grasp of the
frame of the ship and twice he caught
himself by . hooking- his heels Into a
groove in the cross beams.
The trip was mafic after several at
tempts covering a period of three weeks.
When the big airship sailed away the
crowds cheered and Wild waved his hand
gleefully.
For a time all went well, the dirigible
machine moving to the south Bmoothly.
Then the engine operating the propeller
stopped because the supply of gasoline
was exhausted. With that came to the
airship man the realization that he was
gcing higher and higher and had no
means of propelling the ship in the di
rection of the earth.
Wild, In a frantic endeavor to escape
destruction, climbed into the network
Of the gas-filled bag above him and
holding on, with the fingers of one hand
tiniest frozen, with his teeth unfastened
the cord that held the escape valve, per
mitting the gas to escape In sufficient
quantities to allow his floating to the
ground.
. The pulling down of the airship by its
Wr-ail rope was accomplished by two
A.omen and a boy with the greatest diffi
culty and at great personal risk, for
several parts of the machinery became
Cetached and their falling to the ground
bo lightened the balloon that it struggled
\u25a0with renewed energy to escape Into the
clouds. If it had escaped from the res
cuers. Wild's dfeath would have been cer
tain, as he would have been carried out
Into the lake.

Chancellor, replying to the criticism of the
Socialists that G<Tmany's foreign policy
was calculated to disturb the peace of the
world repelieo empirically the assertion
that the Gorman Kmperor, who for
eighteen years had given so many proofs
of his honest Jove of peace, was in any
way a disturber of that peace. During
the past surntr.'er, s^-id the Chancellor,
while the Emperor was in Denmark,
among the ncj.spai*?r clippings sent to
him from Germany was one containing
the word* "Enperoc- William has no
warlike planf. That lies in the nature of
things and in ins character of the peo
ple over whosÂ» hcaa the Kmperor is
placed."
The Chancellor said thatÂ»the Emperor
wrote on the margin of this clipping:

King of Penmt Vx"
The reabon so C3a:iy Englishmen believe
that Germany is a disturber of the

men and children. They came from
Riga, Vilna, Kieff, Odessa and Kovno.
All. had escaped by various methods
after having fled from their homes on

Two me.n; Ephrlam Grolstascher, a
butcher, i and. Joseph Dubovsky, a wood

fury of the mob did not seem to be di

many, of -that faitu -became victims,
while Christians and students who, in

ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 18.â The
Government's â¢ advices to-day from the

most alarming character. Bands of
thousands of . Lettish , peasants are
roaming the country/ln the vicinity of
Riga putting the torch to the bouses
on all the estates and even threatening
the town of Riga itself. The districts
of Riga and Vendon are entirely in the
hands of the insurgents. The revolt is
spreading to all parts of Courland. .'All

CZAR STANDS BY DE WITTH. _
Reactionist Campaign Aeatnst the Pre-
mier Has Failed.
ST. PETERSBURG, Wednesday,-mid
night, Dec. 13.â According to reports from
Tsarskoe-Selo the reactionary campaign,
headed by General Count Alexis Igna
tleit and M. Steschinsky, formed to ef
fect the downfall of Count de Witte and
to create a dictatorship, has failed and
his Majesty is standing, firmly by the
Premier.
M. Menshlkoff, tho* well-known writer,
who is close *touch j with the Count, is
out with a strong article demanding the
inauguration of an aggressive fight
against the revolution, before . It la too
late. M. Menshikoff says:
"The revolutionaries openly. .send emis
saries and do not conceal their intentions.
They act In the full light of day, while
the Government works in secret. The
Government, it is true, has cannon, but
perhaps only for the present, while they
arÂ« not necessary. When they are need
ed none can guarantee that they will not
be In the possession of the revolution
aries.
"The present anarchy and suspense are
due to the inaction of the Government.
De Witte, like Kuropatkin, not only per
mits the enemy to arm and to concen
trate his forces, but to make his dispo
sitions and to choose the moment for
giving battle. Such tactics will no more
win in Russia than they did In Manchu
ria." v
-The balance sheet of the Government
for the first eight months of the current
year makes a fairly favorable showing.
The expenditures totaled $991,600,000, In
cluding $394,000,000 for those of an extra
ordinary character. The receipts were
$1,006,000,000, Including $358,000,000 from the
proceeds of loans, etc. The ordinary re
ceipts -were $39,500,000 In excess of those
for 1904, and thÂ© ordinary expenditures
$8,500,000 less. ;.;:
The explanation offered for the mania
which has seized the peasants In many
provinces to cut down forests, both pub
lic and private, is ,that the mujlks j have
been made to believe that the Emperor
has declared a division of the arable land
and that > he desires to bring, the forest
lands into , that: category. -
The latest class to organize is the'ehim
ney sweeps., They have decided that It
will be Impossible for them to work with
out the promulgation of a constitution.

"The revolutionaries are preparing

lows:
The most notabl* event of -the year In the
United States la the successful revolt against

parts of the country. Am the lustration to
civil sen-ice reform la to free thÂ« country from
the boss, this event Is a source of Kreat joy
to nm who have labored so lon* In tho good
cause. But with our satisfaction there comes
to all serloua minded men the fear lest tne

Frank Gullikson. a Youth, Is
Arrested for the Hold-Up
of William Branskey Mead
DENIES HE IS GUILTY
Roommate Makes Statement
Which Leads Police to Be
lieve They Have Right Man
fiince lapt Friday night, when William
Branrkey Mead was held up and robbed
cf %Z C 5 and his valise near the Four
itUe House, South San Francisco, the po
lice have been diligently searching for the
footpad. What spurred them on is the
fact that Mead lost the sight of. one eye
from the- blow he received, and will in all
probability lose the sight of the other.
Yesterday Mounted Policeman Callahan
and Gaughran arrested Frank Gullikson
and Pete Olsen, who live together In a
room in South San Francisco, on suspi
cion of being implicated in the hold-up,
and brought them to the City Prison.
Captain Burnett detailed Detectives Bun
ner and Frcel to interview the two sus
pects.
They questioned Gullikson first. He de
nied that he knew anything about the
robbery, but finally ssid that he met
Mead in Mrs. Florentine's saloon, and
had been drinking with him till shortly be
fore 6 o'clock, when Mead left. Gullikson
said he left a few minutes later, but
did not acain see Mead.
Olsen was then questioned and admitted
that while hÂ« was talking with a friend
on Friday night, Guliikson came up to
tnem and called him aside and told him
to go to a certain place and see if he
could find anything that had been dumped
cut of a valise. Gullikson said he had
"slugged" an old fellow, and had taken
some coin and a valise from him, but he
did not think there was anything worth
while In the valise. When Gullikson was
informed of what Olsen had said he mere
ly replied that Oisen did not know what
he v,&b talking about.
Gullikson wiil be charged with robbery
and Olsen will be detained as a witness.
Gullikson Is IS years of age and got Into
trouble before when he was 10 years old.
Mead is at the City and County Hospital.

He denied that he unduly Influenced

MAID'S APPETITE
IS SHARPENED BY
RESTAURANT FARE
Her Escort Adopts Subterfuge
to Sidestep Her Hint
BUT SHE SHAMES HIS FACE
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
When she had consumed a shrimp
salad, a dozen fried oysters (large
Eastern) and a cracked crab (fully
matured) the young woman remarked
that she was impressed by the appe
tizing quality of the viands served at
the Sutter-street cafe In which she was
supping tete-a-tete with Russell Red
enbaugh, a railway clerk.
"Gracious knows!" ehe continued,
surveying the empty dishes before her,
"what I have Just eaten ought to sat
isfy any one except a glutton, and at
home the folks say I don't get away
\u25a0with enough food to keep a canary
alive."
She picked up the menu and scanned
it, and Mr. Redenbaugh suddenly de
clared that he had forgotten to ascer
tain, via telephone", the condition of
his very dear and extremely ill bach
elor friend, Joe.
"I promised to call up the doctor at
midnight, and here it is now 12:20," he
exclaimed, in tone of poignant regret.
"I wonder what Joe will think of me,
anyway? The nurse hasn't had a wink
of sleep since yesterday morning, and
if Joe can't get anybody else to relieve
her, I guess I'll have to sit up with
him. Excuse my" absence â I'll be back
in a Jiffy." he concluded, hastily moving
doorward.
"Oh, cert," she sweetly murmured.
"It's the first I've heard of poor, sick
Joe, but that's no reason you should
neglect the nurselady."
He surreptitiously winked at him
self and vanished. The wink was mir
rored, however, and she saw Its reflec
tion and pushed a bell button. To the
gentleman of color who promptly ap
peared in response to the call she ten
dered an order that made his eyes pop.
"Gimme," she said, consulting the
card, "a Saratoga fry, a quart of golden
sherry, imported, a dozen frog legs, a
small black coffee with cognac and a
pack of Imperial cigarettes."
"Yessim," gasped the waiter. "Nuffln
else, 'M?"
"I guess that will hold me for
! a while," was the drawled reply.
Mr. Redenbaugh returned with the
intelligence that it was as he had
feared â upon him devolved the duty of
relieving the nurse. "And the doctor
says I've got to go at once," ne peev
ishly added. "But I suppose you have
had enough to eat?"
"Ko; but I will in a minute or two."
As she spoke the waiter entered with
the edibles and drinkables and smoke
ables she had ordered, and Mr. Reden
baugh sank speechless into the chair he
had recently vacated.
"Now, don't you keep the nurse wait
ing and losing her sleep on my ac
count," his fair vis-a-vis cordially said
as she poured out a glass of sherry;
"Just pay the man and I'll do the rest."
The extra viands footed up to a total
of three dollars and something, and
Mr. Redenbaugh chokingly expressed
both inability and disinclination to pay
for them. While he argued with the
waiter the subject of discussion rapidly
disappeared before the lady's voracious
onslaught, and when all the food and
liquids were consumed ehe lighted a
cigarette, airily blew a cloud upward,
vociferously pronounced Mr. Reden
baugh "a cheap skate," and haughtily
swept from the apartment.
Not until he had been subjected to
the Indignity of arrest for defrauding
an innkeeper did Mr. Redenbaugh pay
the extra three dollars and something.
His companion of the early night did
not reappear, nor was the sleep-craving
nurse relieved. Police Judge Mogan
patiently heard, all the testimony and
then dismissed the case.
â¢ â¢ â¢ \u2666
Â£?. K. Weir, conductor of an Eddy-street
car, was accused of battery, the com
plainant being Manassa Taylor (col
ored), a porter employed at McDonald's
pharmacy, on Market street, but Judge
Cabanies dismissed the case because the
tfcFt'.mony of the defendant and, his mo
tornec-r outweighed that for the prose
cution.
Mr. Taylor said he was repeatedly sub
jected to Indignity by Conductor Weir, on
whose car he rode in from the Chutes.
While he was standing upon a platform
of the vehicle and leaning against a door
the latter was abruptly slid aside by the
defendant, and when Mr. Taylor remon
strated he was roughly asked for his
fare, which he had paid. Then he leaned
against the guard gate on the closed side
cf the platform, and again the defendant
assailed him, hurling him aside and
threatening to strike him with an Iron
switching rod.
Both the conductor and the motorneer
swore that Mr. Taylor was very "sassy";
that he was not assaulted at all and
that he did not pay his fare until he had
been asked for it several times.
Ye Gee and Ah Sing, booked for va
grancy, told Judge Conlan that it was
their Jebut in the Police Court, but after
bestowing upon them an all-embracing
glance, his Honor opined they were fab
ricating. " â¢ ,
"Don't you remember." he 6aid to them,
"that about two years ago you stood Just
where you are now standing and that I
gave you six months apiece for the of
fense with which you are again charged?"
Ye Gee shook his head and resorted to
"Xo shabbee," but Ah Sing, probably ap
preciative of the court's ability to rake
up prior convictions, allowed his features
to relinquish their expression of injured
innocence and assume that of enlighten
ing recollection.
"Ah, rce shabbee now," he said. "Slix

yeah long time. Me floget. Now me

Ye Gee also suddenly recovered . his
memory.
"Two yeah dam long time 'go," he mur
mured remlniscently. "Me 'membah now.

"I'll give both of you six more to-mor
row," said the Judge.
Patrick Garvey, arrested while publicly
disrobing himself at 5:30 o'clock on Third
street, near Howard, informed Patrolman
Ruggles and also Judge Mogan that he
was a miner from Green Canyon, San
Mateo County, and the statement gave
rise to .quite an animated discugslon
among the attorneys in court as to the
material resources of San Mateo County,
come of the participants opining that
minerals of value is not of them.
"As cheese seems to bo a sterling prod
uct of the county across San Francisco's
southern boundary line," said the speak
er, "this defendant Js either a cheese
miner or a conscienceless prevaricator."
Then somebody thought of asking Mr.
Garvey himself what kind of mining he
pursued, and when he laconically replied
"Coal," the subject was abruptly dropped
and he was remanded for sentence.
"If you make it no more than ten
days," bCld Miss Ruby Young to Judge
Fritz, "I won't care so much, but I would

that tribune her desire was gratified.
"I'll make it ten days, marked down
from ninety, which I intended to make it
when you reminded me that the Christ
mas spirit of benevolence Is abroad in the
land," Quoth the court.
Nlg-ht's shades were falling upon Co
lumbia Square when a policeman found
Mrs. Mary Burke reclining upon a
bench and emitting raucous nasal
trumpetings. A closer inspection of the
recumbent form disclosed to the of
ficer's gaze the fact that it was thinly
garbed, considering the frigidity of the
atmosphere. A shirtwaist, cut decol
lete hardly seemed to be en regie
while fur mufflers imparted no bodily
discomfort. V
"Giddap," he commanded, shaking
an exposed shoulder, "and tell me what

When she sat erect and attempted
to speak he perceived that she was

"But the sun had disappeared long:

Honor.
"That's it," she rejoined. "Says

THIRD MAN
IDENTIFIES
M'GRATH
F. W. Willis. Says, Corpse
Lying at Oakland Morgue
Is the Body of Pugilist,
Who Was His Messmate
CORONER'S JURY CAN
NOT SOLVE MYSTERY
No Light Is Shed on Manner
in Which Sausalito Sport
Met His End on Jagged
Rocks of Railroad > Mole
. The mystery surrounding the death oi.
Francis H. McGrath, whose body, found
on the rocks of the broad gauge mole
a week ago, has been thrice identified,
was not cleared last night at the Coron
er's inquest in Oakland.
â¢ The testimony gave no clew as to how
the man met death and with an abund
ance of precaution the jurors returned
a non-committal verdict. They found
that the man met death by a gunshot
wound in the head, but how, v when or
where waa left unsolved.
Without hesitation yesterday after
noon F. W. Willis, mechanic for the
Sixty-eighth Company of Coast Artillery;
Identified the body at the Oakland
Morgue as that of Francis Hall Mc-
Grath, who was murdered on the rocks
of the broad gauge mole several days
ago.
Willis had served with McGrath for
eighteen months in the Philippines, knew
him well and was armed with a descrip-;
tion of the dead soldier furnished by Ser
geant F. B. Clark of Company No. 68 that
is stationed at Fort Baker. It was by the
scars on the body of the dead man that
Willis made the identification. \u25a0 '.
"I went to Manila with the company of
which I am now the mechanic," said Wil
lis yesterday. "In 1599 Francis Hall Mc-
Grath joined our command in the Phil
ippines; and for eighteen months he was
one of my messmates. Naturally, the de
composed body is hard to Identify, but
from the general appearance and the de
scription furnished by Sergeant .Clark I
believe that the dead man Is McGrath. I
will say positively that the body at the
Morgue is that of McGrath, unless there
is a peculiar case of McGrath having a
double. I came from Fort Baker to iden
tify the remains, and I think I have suc
ceeded In my purpose."
Willis was accompanied by George W.
Smith, an expressman of Sausalito, by
whom McGrath was formerly employed.
Smith also declared that he believed the
body to be that of McGrath. ...
"When McGrath returned from the
Philippines, October 23, 1901, he went to
work for the Sperry Express Company,"
said Smith, "but he often did work for
me. While I cannot be positive,' I believe
tho body In the Morgue is that of Me-
Grath, whose description tallies exactly
with that of the body tnat I viewed to
day."
The description furnished by Sergeant
Clark from the army records is that Mc-
Grath was 24 years and 8 months old In
ISO 9. He had blue eyes, light brown hair
and a dark complexion. There was a
tattoo mark on his left arm and the fol
lowing scars: Two on the abdomen, one
on the lower left arm, one on the lower
and another on the upper part of the left
leg and three on the back.
An examination of the body yesterday
did not disclose the scars on the back, al
though every other scar described was
found," with the exception of the tattoo
marks. The back of the body was badly
decomposed, and the scars may have been
obliterated, and this la also true of the
tattoo marks. About the two vaccina
tion scars on the left arm were three pale
blue dots, but they may have been due
to decomposition.
The body was taken out for burial yes
terday, but upon "orders from Coroner
Mehrmann it was returned, and will not
be burled until to-morrow.
At the inquest last evening Maurice
Bowden and Anthony Pivar, boys, testi
fied to finding the corpse. J. E. Pedro,
a watchman <Jn the mole, .said he saw
a man that answered to the dead man's
description at 1 o'clock last Thursday
afternoon, two hours before the body
was found. Pedro warned the stranger
and was told to "mind his own busi
ness."
Dr. O. D. Hamlln, who followed, testi
fied that the body had been in the water

JTOHy McyAUGHT '. - Manager
PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MAKICET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
FRIDAY DECEMBER 15, 1905
MORALS IN OAKLAND.
OUR neighboring city is just now in what is called "the throes
of an upheaval." Certain clergymen have made sensational
and spectacular charges, that seriously involve the repute and
good name of Oakland. When these charges are analyzed it is
evident that they rest entirely on the general opinion of some earn
est people, that no city is superior to Sodom and Gomorrah that
permits the sale of liquor, upon which all evils are supposed to
impinge. The commercial bodies of Oakland have taken up the
matter in a spirit of defensive fairness, with a desire to correct what
they believe to be a false impression detrimental to the welfare and
future of the town.
But the clergy are not idle, and are preparing for a further ac
cusative campaign. In this they are to be aided by the volunteered
testimony of cooks and waiters who lost their places in the recent
open shop campaign, and who propose to tell what they saw in the
side entrances and private stalls of their late employers. This kind
of evidence would be better if the witnesses had felt the pangs of
moral revolt while they were still in the service of their sinful em
ployers and taking the wages of wickedness. To wait until they
are discharged and then join the ranks of salvation savors rather
too much of vengeance and blackmail to make that kind of testi
mony very effective. Any way the commercial bodies and business
men generally resent the use of such means to advertise the town
as being tainted. They retort with some spirit and entire truth
fulness that the two most noted cases of moral lapse known in the
city for some time had no origin nor relation to the restaurant and
saloon business, for the parties were rather noted workers in the
very denominations from whose pulpits the indictment of the whole
city has been promulgated.
The Call has believed and still believes that Oakland has had
for a long time and has to-day an unusually clean and upright city
government. The Mayor and leading members of the City Council
are business men, largely interested in the progress and prosperity
of the city, anxious for its development and perfectly aware of the
intimate relation between the moral and material interests of a
city. While they do not expect to make a new Jerusalem of Oak
land, it is not thinkable that they wink at crime and promote it by
indifference. While the clergy are to be commended for their zeal,
and every citizen should join them in a crusade against the real
evils of society, discretion should hot be thrown overboard.
All cities have evil in them. In some its existence is concealed
and in many there is more deviltry secretive and covert than in
others where it is aboveboard. Othello demanded of lago that he
give "ocular proof and demonstration" of his charges against poor
Desdemona. The Police Commissioners of Oakland have invited
the accusing clergy to give a bill of particulars, founded on evidence,
to prove their rather vague though violent charges. When the
proofs are submitted there will be something to work on. No
doubt an occasional roasting from the pulpit tends to keep men
and municipal government in the straight and narrow path, but
great harm comes to the innocent in cities declared by their resi
dent clergy to be the worst on earth.
We hope to see the press, pulpit, city government and com
mercial organizations of Oakland so work together in harmony -and
public spirit as to be able to give that good city a clean bill of
moral health, equal to its reputation for physical health, clemency
of climate, business enterprise and good local government.
Human nature will lapse. The first family of man, according
to orthodox Christian belief, was a hard lot. The second start af^er
the flood was bad, for the head, of the family in the second genesis
was a hard drinker and overwet his clay as soon as he got a winery
going. We appear to have progressed beyond our ancestry, but we

with us, Oakland is not like the cities of the. plain. It is a good

and will crop out in every community.
OUR HINTERLAND.
T^HE State Board of Trade has taken up another subject of very
I great interest to San Francisco. Premising that the Sacramento
* Valley has reached its limit of population with its present facili
ties and products, the State Board of Trade proceeds to show that
irrigation of land and division of large holdings will enable the set
tlement in that valley within a reasonable time of a population of a
half million. There is no question about the climate and the soil.
Both are competent to the support of a dense population, but wheat
and field cropping, under present conditions, have reached their
limit and in some places the process of decline is visible.
The valley is not without object lessons to support the'eonten
tion of the State Board of Trade. Butte and Sutter counties show
the blessings of irrigation and intensive farming. Yuba has some
showing of the same kind, as has Yolo. But the capacities of the
whole valley are equal, and capable of the same development. What
is needed is capital to install the necessary irrigation and take large
tracts and subdivide them for settlement. The capitalists of this
city built the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad to
aid* in the development of the San Joaquin Valley. They have
helped a railroad into the Klamath region to get at the trade of a
distant community. But, as Mr. William H. Mills pointed out to
the State Board of Trade, in the Sacramento Valley is a hinter
land for San Francisco with commercial drainage directly to this
city, a current that no rival can divert, where a "population of a
half million can be safely and profitably settled.
To develop that near region will cost no more than the San
Toaquin Valley Railroad. Having done so much for one half of
the great valley of California, why not do as much for the other
half? The State Board of Trade is "collecting all of the reports
on the hydrography and soils of the Sacramento Valley, and the
whole will soon be issued as a bulletin.
The information it will contain should # impress the business
men and capitalists of this city. The enterprise will yield profit to
the individual investors and provide for this city a permanent and
cTOwine addition to its commercial resources.

IHE SAN FKANUSCO CALL, 'FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1905.
Ibsen in Nevada.
Ibsen's Norwegian play of "Ghosts,"
with one setting of scenery, no musla
and three knocks with a club on the floor
to raise the curtain, was presented Jast
evening.
The play is certainly a moral hair
raiser, and the stuffing is knocked out
of the decalogue at every turn.
Mrs. Alving, the leading lady, who
keeps her chin high In the air, has mar
ried a moral monstrosity in the shape of
a spavined rake, and hides It from the
\u25a0world. She wears a pleasant smile and
gives society the glad hand, and finally
lets go all holds when her husband gets
gay with the hired girl and gives an old
tar 300 plunks to marry her and stand
the responsibility for the expected popu
lation. *
Oswald, the mother's only boy, is sent
to Paris to paint views for marines, and
takes kindly to the gay life of . j capi
tal, where the Joy of living is tne rage,
and families are reared in a section
where a printer running a job office
solely on marriage certificates would hit
the poorhouse with a dull thud.
Regena, the result of Mr. Alving's at
tentions to the hired girl, also works in
the family, and falls in love with the
painter boy on his return from Paris.
They vote country life too slow, and
plan to go to Paris and start a family.
The doting mother gives her consent,
and Pastor Menders, who is throwing
fits all through the play, haÂ§ a spasm.
The boy, on being informed that the
girl of his- choice is his half sister,
i throws another, his mamma having also
thrown a few In the other act.
Engstrand, who runs a sort of sailors'
and soldiers' canteen, sets fire to an or
phanage, and the boy, who has inherited
a sort of mayonnaise-dressing brain from
his awful dad, tears about the stage a
spell, breaks some furniture and upsets
the wine. He finally takes "rough on
rats" and dies a gibbering idiot, with his
mother slobbering over him and trying
to figure out In her own mind that he
was merely drunk and disorderly.
The players handled the' sticky mess
as well, as could be expected, all being
excellent actors, although Miss Razeto
built up her bustle too high. Miss Lock
wood is strong, and Mestayer handles
his thankless role conscientiously. Mac-
Gregor, as Pastor Menders, was very ef
fective, but there was no better actor in
the cast than Edwin Bailey in his minor
role. \u25a0
As a sermon on the law of heredity the
play Is great, but after seeing It we are
glad to announce that Haverley's Min
strels will relieve the Ibsen gloom next
Monday night.â Carson Appeal.
Kaiser and the Sentinel.
It Is told of the Kaiser's Christmas
walk through the woods last year that
near th,e palace of Sans Soud he came
upon a half-frozen sentinel with very
blue lips and a very red nose. The sen
tinel, with stiff' fingers, brought his rifle
to the salute.
"Cold day," said his Majesty, cheerily.
The sentinel did not reply, but his teeth
chattered.
"How long have you been on duty?"
asked the Kaiser.
"Brr-rr!" said the sentinel.
"Stupid!" said his Majesty. "Why
don't you speak when I* address you?"
The sentinel opened his mouth, but the
words seemed to be frozen on his lips.
"Here!" said'the Kaiser to his adju
tant, laughing, "March chap to the
palace, see that he gets a good meal and
a hot drink, and for heaven's sake put
him before a fire and thaw him out, par
ticularly his Jaws!" And, "Here," he
went on, forcing a coin into the frozen
soldier's rigid fingers, "take this and
drink my health and the health of the
Empress." 'â¢,\u25a0,'â¢ "
Then, as the Emperor hurried away
the sentry found voice enough to bellow
out the single word, "Majestaet!"â

WHAT THE MAN OF MARS SAW.
The man of Mars was telling about his
trip to the earth. "Once," he said, "my
patent air-condenser refused to 'work,
and I very nearly suffocated to death,
but fortunately I got it to condensing
again before it was all up with me."
"That's all right," interposed another
man of Mars, "but tell us about the
people down there. Are they intellect
ual?" \u0084:\u25a0-Â»â¢;-â¢
"Very."
"That's good! What grave you the
impression?"
WHEN IGNORANCE ISN'T BLISS.
"Why, some of them have so many
brains that they have to drink stuff to
reduce the quantity and quality of
them."
"Well, I'll be derned!" said all the
Martians, as with one voice. Then ono
of them asked:
"Do they recognize a supreme power â
a God?"
"You bet they dol" was the response. 1
"We people of Mars are not in it when
It comes to recognition and worship of
the Almighty. In all the affairs of life
his name, as they speak it. is on their
lips. You meet them on the street, and
they talk about him; in their clubs he
iis the subject of conversation, and In
their homes it is the same. He is re
membered at the time of their birth, and
when they are cold in death their friends
first of all inquire concerning their life
relations with him."
"This is wonderful that you tell us,"
said an ancient Martian; "do they give
this much worshiped Almighty One a
name?"
â¢ "Indeed they do," was the answer; "It
Is forever on their lips."
"What is this august name of the
deity that is so dear to them?" the an
cient Martian asked.
"The name, always lowly and rever
ently spoken," the man of Mars replies,
"is Dollars. He is their God, and I could
not fail to learn his name, because I
heard it so often spoken."
Then the man of Mars appointed a
time and place for a lecture on the sub
ject of "The Ear^h and Its Inhabitants,"
which was what he had had in mind
when he made the trip, and the other
Martians went about their business.
HE DEARLY LOVED RELIGION.
He dearly loved religion of just the
kind he chose,
And he felt extremely certain that his
creed 1 was all that "goes!"
He was sure the God who made us with
a sight exceeding dim
Had In His gracious kindness shown all
the truth to him.
He was honest in his purpose, and we
could not doubt the fact;
He was certain God had shown him all
the meaning of each act; '
He was pure in all his living, and was
strictly free from guile.
But he seemed to have a notion that
the pious never smile.
He seemed to have a notion that the
pious never smile; \
You'd think that vinegar was quite the
; true religious style.
So all youthful pleasure passed him, as
it gayly tiptoed by.
And he viewed It with foreboding and
â¢ a dreary, weary sigh.
He really meant the best on earth, but
then, of course you see,
His visage still proclaimed the fact that
pleasure sin must be:
And so I'm very sorry, though perhaps
it's not worth while.
For the man who had a notion that the
pious" never smile. "
"Will ye give a dime to a poor man,
mum. who has a wife and six ohlldren!"
1 Of course the dime was given and the
barkeeper who received It shortly
thereafter had a wife and six children.

wasted. ,

"No, indeed; it would have been im
possible."
"For his money?"
"No, he is far from wealthy."

expression "perfectly unique" In speak

word means, alone, without a parallel,'

AGE OF A HORSEâ A m Subscriber,
City. The following Is the rule laid
down for telling the age of a horse:
At 3 years old the horse should have
the central permanent nippers growing,
the other two pairs wasting, six grinders
in each Jaw above and below, the first
and fifth level, the others and the sixth
protruding. The sharp edges of the new
incisors will be very evident, compared
with the old teeth. As the permanent
nippers wear and continue to grow, a
narrow portion of the cone-shaped tooth
is exposed by the attrition of the teeth
on each other. The mark will be wearing
out, and the crowns of the teeth will be
sensibly smaller than at 2 years. Be
tween 3** and 4 years the next pair of
nippers will be changed, the central nip
pers will have attained nearly their full
growth, a vacuity will be left where the
second stood, and the corner teeth- will
be diminished in breadth, worn down, and :
the mark in the center of the tooth will
become faint. The second pair of grind
ers will be shed. At 4 years the central
nippers will be fully developed, the sharp
edge somewhat worn off. and the mark
somewhat wider and fainter. The next
pair will be up. but they will be small,
with a mark deep and extending quite
across them. The corner nippers will be
larger than the Inside ones, but smaller
then before and flat, and the mark' nearly
effaced. The sixth grinders will have risen
to a level with the others, and the tushes
will begin to appear. At 5 the. horse's
mouth is almost perfect. The corner
nippers are quite up, the long, deep mark
Irregular In the Inside, and the other nip
pers will bear evident tokens of increased
wear. The tushes are nearly grown, the
sixth molar Is up. and the third molar is
wanting. This last circumstance will pre
vent the deception of attempting to pass
a- lats 4-year-old as a 5-year-old. At 6
the mark on the central nippers is worn
out. At 7 tha mark is worn out In the
four central nippers, and fast wearing
away in the corner teeth. ThÂ© tushes
are rounded at the points and edges, and
beginning to get round inside. At 8 years
old the tushes are rotfhded In every way,
the mark Is gone from, all the bottom nip
pers. There is nothing remaining in them
that can afterward-tlearly show the age
of a horse. After this the only guides
are the nippers In the upper Jaw. At 9
the mark will be worn from the middle
nippers, from the next pair at 10, and
from all the upper nippers at 1L At 9 the
center nippers are round Instead of oval.
At 10 the others begin to become rounded,
at 11 the second pair are much rounded,
at 13 the corner ones have the same ap
pearance, at 14 the faces of the center
nippers become somewhat triangular, at
17 they are all so.

"But It waa moonlighj, and I had no

"Then, senor. with the help of God. I
forgot to charge you with moonlight."
The charge amounted to two cents in
American money, and he had hired % a.i
ass and ridden twenty miles to collecj
it. I was amused and astonished. Then
I accused him of being a robber, and of
fered him a cent to settle the bill. He
worked up a beautiful smile and held
out his hand.
"I will take It with thanks, senor," he
said, "and God will bless you for an
honest man!**

Supreme Court Tells Where
and How a Corporation's
Franchise May Be Taxed
AFFECTS BIG CONCERNS
Counties Within Which the
Privileges Are Enjoyed
May Secure the Revenue
Tho Supreme Court handed down four
decisions yesterday establishing the
principle, that the franchises of corpora
tions must be taxed by counties in
which active operations are conducted
Instead of in the counties where their
respective headquarters are maintained.
The corporations which instituted the
four suits are the Oakland Water Com
pany, the Contra Costa Water Com
pany and the Stockton Gas and Electric
Company. The first two concerns, the
franchises of which must be taxed in
Oakland, have their central offices in
San Francisco. The gas and electric
company franchise has its home office
In San Francisco, but its franchise will
l'O taxed In San Joaquin County. Both
opinions were written by Justice Lori
jran.
The Stockton case was an action in
stituted by the corporation to compel
the return of money paid as taxes on
its franchise for the years IS3B and 1599
to the officials of San Joaquin County.
The company paid taxes on its pipes,
poles and other property located in
Stockton, but maintained that the fran
chise was taxable only in this city. The
court in its opinion considers the points
presented by the two sets of attorneys
â¢tit great length and a majority of the
Justices conclude that the franchise fs
Taxable at its situs (Stockton) instead
of at its locus (.San Francisco)!
The reason for the decision is based
on the fact that the privilege of the
franchise Is enjoyed at the seat of oper
ations. Justice McFarland dissented
from the majority opinion. Justice Hen-
Bhaw was disqualified from participating
and Justice Cooper of the Court of Ap
peals took his place.
The O&kland water companies were
taxed for their franchises by Assessor
Dodge, but claimed that they should
have been taxed, if at all, in Alameda
County. The court, for the reason stated
:n th 3 Stockton case, agrees with them.
The decision will affect numerous cor
porations that have a headquarters in
one place and do their principal business
In other counties. Companies that do
not conduct business under public fran
chises are not affected. The value of a
franchise under the decision is ascer
tained by deducting the value of a con
cern's tangible property from the full
value of its stock.

McMCUPHY'S WIFE I. ONUS
HER SUIT FOR DIVORCE
Spouae Accuned of Wearing: Tights and
Smoking: Tarkinh Pipe It*-
Defeated.
Judge Mnrasky has denied the peti
tion of Lillian M. for divorce from
Frederick McMurphy. He ordered,
however, that McMurphy pay Mrs. Mc-
Murphy $50 a month for her support.
She accused him of cruelty, and in a
cross complaint he asserted that she
caused him great mental distress, by
wearing tights around the house and
smoking a Turkish pipe. Judge Mu
rasky held, however, that the offenses
of neither of them were of such a
character or degree to warrant the
granting of a divorce.
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to Laura F. from F. E. Saucier,
for desertion; Irene from Joseph Cahen,
for desertion; Annie Caroline from
Frederick Orton, for desertion, and
Belle from George W. Burling, for.de
sertion.
Suits for divorce were filed by Al
fred against Elisabeth Harrison, for de
sertion; James R. against Mary E. Fll

Glass, for cruelty; Kristlne O. against

PROVES BRAIN
IS ELECTRIC
Dr. A. J. Atkins of This City
Completes a Eemarkable
Experiment on a Steer
EECOEDS A' CUKKENT
Says That the Human Hind
Is Catching the Vibrations
of the Universal Ether
Dr. Albert J. Atkins, a- physician of
tlrts city, whose experiments In the
electrical actions Of the- organs of the
body have' become a part of the history
of medicine, has just completed an ex
periment whereby he claims to show
positively that the brain action of a hu
man being is due merely to the presence
'of electrical currents In the cells; that
the brain is a delicate electrical appa
ratus, which may become In tune with
the . vibrations of universal ether and
catch from it the wireless messages of
thought: that the senses, are due to the
effect" of electricity In the ether and that
the electric current Is carried to the
brain. *
That electric currents exist in the
muscles and nerves has been demon
strated by. such experimenters as Gal
vani, Mateucchi, Dubois Raymond arid
others, but that the brain Is a delicate,
electrical apparatus, which .guides the
body, was never discovered until'Dri.At
kins announced to the world yesterday
that he had accomplished that over
which many had failed. .
Dr. Atkins' experiment is simple enough
and seems to prove conclusively his con
tention that the brain Is an electrical
apparatus. Furthermore, to prove that
his figures are correct, he and his as- N
sistanta performed the work under the
eyes of Captain L. D. "Wildman, Signal
Corps, TJ. S. A., and member of the
American Society of Electrical En
gineers, who has made a separate report
on the experiment, agreeing In every de
tail with that of Dr. Atkins.
STICKS XEEDLES IN BRAIN.
The experiment was performed on a
Texas steer at Butchertown two days
ago. First two holes were bored in the
skull of the animal to connect directly
with the brain. Great care was taken
with the knives and, owing to the use
of cocaine, the steer suffered little.
Then two platinum electrodes were
stuck directly Into the thought part of
the brain. These electrodes .were con
nected by a long copper wire to a deli
cate galvanometer 100 feet . away. Cap
tain I Wiidman took the readings on the
galvanometer.
The steer submitted quietly to the
sticking of the electrodes In his brain
and lay down in a resting position. He
was apparently at ease. He was breath
ing naturally, and his heart action was
normal. He was apparently in, the same
mental and physical condition as before
the needles had entered his brain.
In this normal condition, the galva
nometer registered from six to seven
points. The test was a long one, so that
no possible mistake could be made. Cap
tain WHdman read off the figures as they
were registered on the galvanometer.
Then Dr. Atkins gave the signal for
the steer to be. killed. .^ The throat of the
animal was cut .The\electrlcal current
in the brain Increased and pri the gal
vanometer the register reached twenty
nine points. As the life grew extinct
the register became lower, until It finally
reached two points.
ELECTRIC POWER IS FOUND.
This electric power could only come
from the action of the brain Itself or
from the warmth of the blood.. Experi
ments with blood failed to register more
than two degrees. "The electric cur
rent," declared Dr. Atkins, "comes from
the brain Itself. When the animal real
ized that It was being killed. Its thoughts
came fast and the â¢ electricity Increased.
The brain is the electrical apparatus of
the body. The problem has been solved.'-'
With Dr. Atkins in his experiment
were Drs. Emma A. Lewis, his co-worker
in all of his experiments; H. W. Husaker,
president of the State Medical Society;
A- B. Nelson, professor in the medical
department of the University of Cali
fornia, and Dr. Wheeler, president of the
County Dentists' Association.
Dr. Atkins Intends to send an account
of his experiments and discoveries to
every university of the world. He has
long been making experiments along
electrical lines and has been working on
the theory which he proved by the steer
for over five years. His work has
brought him much praise. Yesterday he
received a congratulatory letter from
Luther Burbank.

COLLINS STILL
ENTERS DENIAL
Defendant Spends Uncom
fortable Day on the Stand
Under Cross-Examination
George D. Collins spent a doubly un
comfortable day yesterday on the witness
stand in Judge Lennon's courtroom, when
he uttered repeated denials to the ques
tions of District Attorney Bylngton,
punctuated by fits of coughing-, the de
fendant suffering from a cold and ulcer
ated throat. ColllnÃ was finally allowed
by the court to visit a physician during:
the afternoon, an adjournment being:
taken until 10 o'clock this morning:.
Little new testimony was elicited during
the day's cross-examination of the wit
ness by Bylngton. Questions regarding
Collins' association with the Newman
family, his account of the marriage cer
emony and of his trip to British Colum
bia were asked, and not once during: the
entire day did the witness confine his
answers to "Yes" or "No." He frequently
was checked In long explanations and
evasions, constantly objected to Bying
ton's method of examination and claimed
the District Attorney continually misrep
resented his former testimony. /
A transcript coming from British' Co
lumbia, showing what purports to be
Collins' testimony before the courts at
Victoria, was brought forward by the
prosecution. Collins' answers In this tes
timony showed variance with his present
answers on the stand. Wherever these
differences appeared ' they were shown,
and Collins said that 'the transcript was
wrong and that he did no' make the an
swers accredited to him. The prosecu
tion intends to prove the verity of the
transcript by witnesses present at the
time the testimony was given, and it will
be offered in evidence. s *' : . '\u25a0
LETTERS TO CHABLOTTA.
Letters of the defendant to Charlotta,
showing that his interest in her was per
sonal in its nature, were Introduced
Many of them show merely perfunctory
interest, but the following extracts were
taken by the District Attorney to mean
that Collins had more than the interest
of a brother-in-law in the welfare of
Charlotta:
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 20. ISSB.
My Dear Charlotta:
Your letter of the 17th tnst. was yeeterday
received by me. Its receipt affording mÂ« lnex
preszlble pleasure, aa Is ana ever will be the
case with all your letters.
You would have me to understand that the
thunderstorm not only didn't scare you, but
that you enjoyed It. I would â¢ like to believe
that, but it 1Â« difficult for me to convince my
self that juet at the time when It would bÂ»
likely that your timidity would get the better
of you that you would view the scene with a
complacency truly wonderful. Still, I have un
bounded confideac* la your capabilities, and, aa
THE SAN FRANCISGO' GALL, : FRIDAY^DECEMBER; 15, 1905.
you have said In effect tnat you were not
frightened. I will believe you, the more espe
cially as I troubled myself considerably about
you while that storm was raging-, thinking that
you were trembling with fear.
t CTTY. Feb. 26, '89.
My Dear Charlotta:
You will recollect that the other evening you
epoke about taking dancing lessons.
I feel that I owe It to you as a strict obliga
tion to protect your welfare from any and
everything that might have the least tendency
to imperil It. Now there Is no objection to
dancing in itself, unless it be that It Is a non
sensical amusement â it being somewhat ludi

COLLINS AS A MORALIST.
That, of course, is an objection, but there la
a more lerlous objection tnan that. It is this:
As a general thing dancing furnishes the op
portunity of Indulgences that are at variance
with propriety, to say the least, and experience
has shown that the great majority of persons
who participate In this very queÂ«tlonablÂ«
amusement do so principally for the purpose of
availing themselves of the opportunity I have
Just referred to.
For your own welfare I must Insist that you
refrain from learning dancing. Affectionately.
GEORGE.
The defendant has denied that he wrote
any letters to Charlotta, except at the
request of Acnes.
Collins asserted that his reference to
the Newman family as "the Newmans"
was not a term of reproach, although he
admitted that he had much to reproach
them for. The statement caused a smile
to visit the face of Joseph Tobln, who
was present yesterday for the first time,
A watch was Introduced In evidence by
the prosecution engraved "Prom George
to Charlotta. Christmas, 1888." . Collins
maintained that he never saw or heard of
the watch before, and added that Char
lotta had an uncle named George living
In Sacramento.

HONORA SHARP
WILL IS VALID
Jury Declares That Testa
trix Was of Sound Mind
and Free From Influence
-* Unanimously the Jury sitting for the
past week in the trial of the contest to
the will of the late Honora Sharp has
sustained her testament as valid. It
has also unanimously branded as false
the charges that Reuben H. Lloyd and
Mme. Margaret Tojettl unduly influ
enced the testatrix and practiced fraud
upon her. . In the will that has been
sustained $25,000 is bequeathed to Mme.
Tojetti and $200,000 to Reuben H. Lloyd
and Adolph Spreckels, Park Commis
sioners, with which they purpose con
structing, a ' memorial entrance tÂ»
Golden Gate Park. ' ; .v.
The contestant to the will was Jo
seph O'Donnell of Haver hill, Mass., and
it was not until after a lawyer with a
quick eye to business called upon him
that he knew that Mrs. Sharp existed
upon this earth. He had never even
heard of her. \u25a0 However, he consented
to lend himself to the scheme to break
her will and signed papers agreeing to
give the attorneys 50 per cent of all
they recovered for him. The jury has
decided that he is entitled to nothing:.
His attorneys will get BO per cent of
this, less the costs of the trial.
To represent the contestant in this
city the Eastern attorneys that discov
ered O'Donnell retained Attorneys Lind
say, Magulre and Wykoff. They forth
with filed a contest, alleging; that while
mentally unsound Mrs. Sharp had been
unduly influenced and defrauded ' by
Mme. Tojetti. and Attorney Reuben H.
Lloyd, with the result that she had ex
cluded the contestant. from the right to
inherit any portion of her wealth. The
will was, defended by Attorney Charles
S/Wheeler. . .
The case was submitted to the jury
yesterday afternoon. Twenty minutes
later; Foreman Norman Ellsworth an
nounced that a verdict had been
reached. The verdict stated that at the
time of the execution . of the will the
testatrix was of sound mind; . that she
.was not. unduly. Influenced by either
Mme. Tojetti or Reuben H. Lloyd, nor
did either of them' seek to practice
fraud upon her. V) ln conclusion,; Fore
man, Ellsworth stated the jury wished
it; understood that' the verdict was
unanimous. .
Judge" Coffey's courtroom presented a
fitting for. the act' of the con
test. > Piled â¢ upon the bench were clus
ters of flowers, and inquiry
developed the fact Â» that it was Judge
Coney's ' birthday. He confessed to the
assembled .attorneys * that -he was 21
years of age and over and was con
gratulated that such had come to pass.
Furthermore, he was congratulated for
his achievements of the many years he
has been on the bench, and Mr. Lloyd
said that the recollection of the Judge's
birthday would always remain fresh In
his mind for the hour that marked the
anniversary of the arrival on this earth
of his Honor also marked his vindica
tion of charges baselessly false and so
legally determined.

The San Francisco Call.
Responding to communications from the Merchants' Sxchange of San Francisco President Roosevelt has written
a ietter in which he expresses his views concerning the Chinese boycott of American goods and also the exclusion
laws. TJhe {President writes that this Sovernment must do Justice as well as exact justice; that Chinese laborers
should be excluded, but thai the exempt classes of Chinese should be treated courteously. Sf the exclusion laws
need to be amended, American merchants must exercise their influence for amendment, he sags. (jhe
adds that the immigration department has acted with utmost harshness toward the Chinese, the fault resting
ultimately with mistaken public opinion. Uhe TTJerchants 1 Sxchange held a meeting and gave prompt acquiescence to
the views by adopting resolutions favoring such amendments to the exclusion laws as would cause them
to conform to what the Chief Executive deemed right and Just.
Reading during every hour of the long
weeks of new atrocities committed at the
very doors of her Russian home, and
fearing that her own family might be
sacrificed at any time upon this altar of
Ignorant brutalism, Gertie Galpern cried
with Joy yesterday when at her place in
the store of the Golden Gate Cloak and
Suit House the postman handed her a
letter from her sister at home. With aj
feeling of happiness she opened it and
began to read its contents. A moment
later and she stood paralyzed with ter
ror, for nowhere in the long letter did
her sister once mention t!Â»n name of her
mother.
Her breath came in hot gasps. Why did
not her sister mention her mother? Was
the mother of them all dead and her sis
ter trying to keep the secret from her?
Had Ehe been the victim of the troops of
the despotic Czar? Mental pictures of her
mother, forced to undergo every horror
and shame that ignorance could devise,
filled the thoughts of this little Russian
girl. Black thoughts of terror followed
in quick succession and in a few minutes
she had fallen into a fit of frantic hys
teria. \u25a0,:!: 5
The women in the store rushed to her
assistance. They could not comfort her.
She would believe none. She could not
be persuaded that her mother might not
have been mentioned in the letter through
a mere inadvertence on the part of her
sister. The women's,, efforts were useless;
she could not be brought out of her hys
teria. A call was sent in to the Central
Emergency Hospital for assistance and
the girl was taken away for treatment.
There Dr. Frank J. Tillman finally suc
ceeded in quieting her fears and turned
her over to friends who came for her.
Gertie Galpern is but 19 years old and
has been in America only one year. Her
father, mother and sister are living in
the country surrounding Moscow and
have been close to the scene of many ter
rible atrocities. They realized the danger
there and each two weeks wrote Gertie
assurances that they were welL Little
wonder, then, that the girl was
taken with hysteria when her sister did
! not once mention the mother's name.
Miss Galpern was born in Russia. More
over, she is proud of the fact that she
grew up to be independent, and a year
ago she came to San Francisco. Here she
worked and saved and wrote letters to
those whom she loved. Every two weeks
a letter came from her sisjter. carrying
the glad news that "All's well." Yester
day came the omission of the mother's
name and the terrible anguish of the
young girl.
Miss Galpern is living with a family at

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY
DIRECTORS OF EXCHANGE
President Roosevelt has written a letter addressed to Secretary T. C. Fried
lander of the Merchants' Exchange of San Francisco, In which, over his own
signature, he discusses the Chinese- restriction laws and Chinese boycott and
makes suggestions that will be read" with Interest. 1 :
The letter to which President Roosevelt replied was sent to Washington
by authority of the Merchants' Exchange by Mr. Friedlander as secretary of
the Exchange. Some time ago the Merchants' Exchange, when the Chinese
boycott on American â¢ goods was comparatively new, held a meeting where
addresses were delivered and a communication to be addressed to President
Roosevelt in relation to the Chinese boycott was authorized. Subsequently
telegrams passed. The letter that is made public this morning was dated at
the White House, Washington, D. C. November 23. Since then the directors of
the Merchants' Exchange have met and adopted resolutions in which it is de
clared as follows: '* : <i
"In the opinion of the Merchants' Exchange the present Chinese exclusion
laws should, in justice and equity, be- so amended as to permit the free Ingress
into the country and the peaceful abiding within the confines of the United
States of Chinese business men, professional men, students and travelers."
The complete text of the letter written by President Roosevelt and the
resolutions adopted by the Merchants' Exchange are given herewith. Presi
dent Roosevelt's letter is as follows:
LETTER OF THE PRESIDENT.
"WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, Not. 23, 1905.
Mr: Your communication of the 6th inst. lias been received. 1 trust
I need hardly say to yon that everything the American Government can
do Trill be done to put a stop to the boycott and to secure for our busi
ness Interests no less than for our other interests fair treatment In China.
Let me take this opportunity, however, of Impressing upon your great and
influential body the absolute need of securing from all good citizens sup
port in the effort of this Government to do Justice as well as to exact
justice.
Undoubtedly one of the chief causes of the boycott has been the abort
comings of the United States Government and people In the matter of the
treatment of the Chinese here. It is our right and duty in the interest of
our own vrage workers to keep out of this country all Chinese of the
coolie class â that Is, Chinese laborers, skilled or unskilled.. In the last
treaty this reciprocal right was explicitly recognized as inhering in the
two nations. The Chinese . have a perfect right" to keep out our 'wage
workers and we have the same right to keep out theirs. But there is ab- \u25a0
solutely no excuse for the failure on our part to treat In a spirit of
largest liberality and courtesy all Chinese business men, professional men,
students and travelers.
Under the law nnd under practices which grew up under the lair
these Chinese merchants, professional men, students and. travelers have
not been properly treated until within the past .year. Where the law
itself is to blame I am powerless and the law should be changed; but
within the past year the objectionable practices that have grown up un
der the law have been to a large extent stopped, thanks to the personal
efforts of Secretary Metcalf.
The Bureau of Immigration and the bureau It succeeded, under suc
cessive chiefs and under many administrations, acted with the utmost
harshness toward the Chinese, the fault resting ultimately with the public
opinion -which demanded- this harsh "reatraent, under an entirely mistaken
and improper Idea of what was accomplished thereby and of its need;
while there existed no sufficient body of public opinion on the other side
even to call attention in effective way to the abuses. .
It was some time before I thoroughly understood where the difficul
ties lay, and that in addition to the defects in the law there were de- v
fects in the practices handed down through a long succession ,of adminis
trations. These practices have not been remedied. The most effective work
that a body like yours can do In helping put a stop to the boycott Is ac
tively to champion these reforms that have been Introduced In the prac
tices of the , Bureau of Immigration, and the reforms necessary in the
PAUSES FOR THE BOYCOTT.
You can be absolutely certain that there will be no permanent re
covery of business conditions, so far \as they- affect American interests
in China, unless we can say with truth that all' just cause of complaint by
the Chinese against us has been removed. Of course the evil done by
such conduct as that I have recited on our part often continues to exist for
quite a time after the, cause of the evil has been removed; and, moreover,
it may be that the evil passions excited, partly by our own actions, will
in China produce results which cannot be met even by acting justly and
courteously on our part. If such should be the. case the American Gov
ernment will most assuredly insist with all possible firmness upon the
rights of its citizens and will take whatever means are necessary; to se
cure them. But -we must ourselves do justice; primarily because to do
justice is right, and secondarily, because only thus can we put ourselves
In a position to demand and insist upon justice being done to us in return.
You way 1b your letter that unless strong steps are taken to stop the
boycott American trade will be put back many years, and that the mer
chants of San Francisco feel that their Interests will be jeopardised. I
wish you to feel that I appreciate this, and that 1 am keenly alive to the
apprehension you express; but, I wish. you also to feel that I have done
everything' ln my. power 'to stop the boycott, and that the State Depart
ment has done everything In its power at present.
Anything further must.be done by your own representatives in â¢ the
Senate and House, by . , way of making such changes In the exclusion ,la w
as to prevent the injustice and humiliation to .which the- Chinese who do
not belong to the coolie class have been subjected in coming to this coun
try. If you and all the '; other American merchants who are Injured by the
boycott will urge upon your re present atl yeÂ» la Congress to do Â« way with

ACTION TAKEN BY EXCHANGE.
- The resolutions adopted by the Merchants* Exchange are, with the preamble,
as follows:
"Whereas, There is at present friction between the governments and the
people of the United States and China in relation to the present Chinese exclu
sion^ laws and their enforcement, which friction has found expression In the
Chinese boycott of American products and goods: and
'â¢Whereas, It is right and proper that all causes of friction between the
United States and China should be removed, having at all times due regard for
the fact that no change should be made whereby American labor, skilled or un
skilled, should be subjected. to competition with what are known as the coolie or
working classes of China: therefore be it >
"Resolved, That in the opinion of the Merchants', Exchange the present Chi
nese exclusion laws should. In Justice and equity, be so emended as to permit the
free ingress into the country and the peaceable abiding' within the confines of the
"United' States of Chinese business men, professional men, students and trav
elers; and be it further
"Resolved, That nothing herein shall be â¢ construed as being in any way in
favor, of. the admission to the United States of the working classes or coolies of
China: and bait furtner :,
'"Resolved. That the Merchants' Exchange deprecates any personal invidious
treatment of any Chinese now in the Un'ted States: and be it further
"Resolved. .That the Merchants-E xchange ) commends the reforms that have
been Introduced in the. practices of the Bureau of Immigration in enforcing the
Chinese exclusion laws: and be it further ggggj
"Resolved that the Merchants' Exchange heartily approves . of the steps
taken jby the President of the United States to relieve tho tension caused by the
'improper treatment of persons of the so-called privileged classes of China seeking
admission to the United States, and that the Merchants' Exchange desires to
. exprers its thanks ' for the j attention "\u25a0 given the matter by. the 'chief executive of

SCOTT ALLEGES CONSPIRACY. .
Insurance Witness Declares That He Is
Betas Persecuted.
NEW YORK, Dec. 14. â During the in
surance investigation to-day, Edward
W. Scott, president .of the Provident
Savings Life Assurance Society, made
an earnest appeal to Chairman .W.
Armstrong of the investigating: com-,
mittee to exclude from the hearing
certain statements bearing on his re
lations with the Equitable Life Assur
ance Society, of which 1 he was formerly
Australian agent. Charles E. Hughes,
counsel for the investigating commit
tee, had asked Scott whether the Equit
able Life Assurance Society had not
had a claim of {100,000 against him.
Scott declared that there was no such
claim against him and presented to
Hughes letters that passed between
Scott and President Alexander on that
subject in 1901, In which President
Alexander asked Scott to make a for
mal admission in writing that his ac
counts with the society, showing bal
ances of $57,933 due .the society, were
accurate. In one letter President Alex
ander wrote that Scott had accepted
the accounts. Scott's letter to Presi
dent Alexander proposed a conference,
but made no admission as to the ac
ceptance of the accounts. .â¢â¢ ,
When these letters had been read,
President Scott made an earnest plea
to the committee to rule that this sub
ject was foreign to the .investigation.
He declared that he had been pursued
by enemies for 'several years; that in
1900 he caused the arrest and indict
ment of a man who had engaged with
the Equitable Life Assurance Society
to deliver to it records stolen from the
Provident Savings Life Assurance So
ciety; that a traitorous bookkeeper
who was In league with this man was
dismissed from the Provident Society's
employ, and that it was in connection
with these matters that his (Scott's)
relations with the Equitable were re
ported to the committee and in a spirit
of revenge. \u0084. . "
Though Hughes did not uncover JuÃt
what the Equitable Society's claim
against Scott was based on, he brought
out from him the statement that the
Equitable Society had made such a
claim upon him and that Scott refused
to settle it.
Another incident In the testimony of
Scott was his statement that, when he
bought control of the Provident Sav
ings Life Assurance Society's stock, he
used $25,000 which had been lent by
that company to two of its agents in
order to enable them to buy 100 shares
of its stock. They did not buy the
stock and Scott said he took over the
loan and delivered to the society a
promise to turn Over to it 100 shares
of its stock- when be got the stock. It
is now held by a trust company, to
which he still owes $50,000 which he
borrowed to buy it.

favor the enlargement of the Interstate

that Congress will agree upon a bill and

STANFORD OARSMEX ORGANIZED.
STANFORD Dec. 14.â
The executive committee of the Stan
ford University body decided . at the
regular meeting heldilast night to In
clude .Intercollegiate boating within
the care of the associated students,
thus putting it on a par with foot
ball, track athletics and baseball.
This action of the committee is' re
garded as a signaPvictory by all oars
men. Some time back the athletic com
mittee allowed the members of the boat
crSw the privilege of the varsity "S."
This caused considerable comment In
the community and was roundly cen
sured by the university press. The
members of the committee, who had
taken what was seemingly hasty action
became alarmed and at a special gath
ering talked of dropping the sport al
together. s Pressure from the outside
was brought to bear, which, coupled
with a generous offer of the San Diego
Boat Club to entertain both univer
sities, caused the men at the head of
the movement t<^ suggest that the' sport
be made a student body and not a club
affair. The action, last night was the
culmination.
Another long suffering aggregation
of athletics of the cardinal were given
the privilege to use the name of Stan
ford when challenging opponents. The
men thus favored were the members of
the basket-ball sauad.
To : morrow evening they will exer
cise their newly acquired right when
they meet a team from the Young
Men's Christian Association of Stock
ton. â¢ The contest will be held at the
river town and the men who will play
will leave in the morning. . The teams
will line up as follows: Stanford â W.
H. Masters '09 and C. L. Peck Jr.. for
wards; P. B. Delano '08, center; R. H.
Bookmeyer '08 and G. J. Presley '07.
guards. . - - -
- Stockton â Rule and Ingis, forwards;
Thomas, center; Conklln^ and. Jackson,

Olympic Club's Christmas Jinks.
The Christmas Jinks of the Olympic
Club, an ambitious effort - founded on
the story of Robin Hood, will bo pre
sented to-night and also to-morrow
night in the club gymnasium j for the
members. The best vocal, literary and
artistic talent has been drawn upon- to
make the affair a brilliant success.
President William Greer Harrison has
written some of the songs. Amon^ the
participants will 'be Dr. Shiela, E.
Courtney Ford, R. M. Rotating and
other clever society actors.

THREE HORSES IN A SPILL
AND RIDERS ARE UNHURT

FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Three horses going down almost in a
he*P and three riders floating through
space, all caused through a spill on the
far turn In the openinr event, gave the
crowd at Ingleside track yesterday a se
vere scare. Battiste with his mount,
Suavlta, were the first to go down, the
colored lad being sharply cut off soon
after passing the half mile pole. Frank
Reed on Tony Girl and J. J. Walsh with
the leg up on Miss Curry next took what
looked like a bad header. Fortunately
none of the riders was injured, although
Reed had an inch or so of cuticle re
moved from one hand.
The racing was almost devoid of class,
and dumps were frequent. Adirondack
and Esherin were the two winning favor
ites.
BAJfTA RJLT ROS THIRD
Santa Ray, a highly touted filly from
Jack Clifford's etable, faced the barrier
for the first time in the maiden two-year
old scramble and was installed favorite.
She did not loom up as if possessed of
Stake qualifications, finishing an ordinary
third. Sug&r Maid, a 4^i to 1 chance, with
bright up, won easily from Travora.
Adirondack, played from 3s down to 11
to 6, beat a riffraff collection in the first
xnlto selling affair as if he might have
been nominated by acclamation in the
Jockeys' room. Jack Little tried for all
he was worth, taking the place from Ora
MeKinney. If some of the other starters
are capable of no better things they
should be hustled off to the abattoir.
Leslie Coggins' mare Esherin took the
third event, also decided over a mile un
der celling conditions. There was little
tction behind her, and at odds of 7 to 5
the went out and won all the way. Bock,
astride Warte Xicht, made a hike from
tc-uth position in time to down Hilee for
the place.
After Jimmy Ooffey had lost enough
betting on Lucrece to purchase a block
of Standard Oil stock, the id^a hit him
to try Tommy Clark on the mare. Her
price went from 8 to 12 in the betting done
on the third mile selling recital, and she
docked first by a ler.grth.
rOWRLI/S SLEEPY RIDE.
Powell's eleepy effort en Dixie Lad
brought the 3 to 10 favorite in second,
end Fastoso ran a fair third".
Both Toco.aw and Andrew B. Cook
started - off on- equal torms when the
layers chalked ur> odus on the seven
starters in the Qve-furicng purse run,
each being quoted at S to 5. The coin
poured in so strong on Cook that the odds
about Tocclaw lengthened to 14 to 5.
Tommy Clark rode Andrew B. Cook, and
while he used every endeavor the bush
sprinter bore out as usual on the turns
end through the stretch. This -cost him
The race, for Graham saved ground on
the rail with Tocolaw, winning the de
cision by a scant head. The show went
to Ruby.
Knarp made an awful botchy mess of it
with Byronerdale, favorite for the con
cluding mile and hundred yards selling
affair. In consequence L>. Williams
landed The Lieutenant a nose in front of
the odds 6n choice at the wire. Barney
i Echreiber> Ed Sheridan ran into the
ehotr. j
UTOTES OF THE TRACK.
Jockey Frank Graham appears to be
gritting Into nis stride, for he dropped
two winners over the plate. He rode
a careful, well-judged race on Tocolaw^
The opening race was full of acci
dents and incidents. Besides the trou
ble on the far turn, McÃrlde, who pilot
ed Alumdina, figured in an unpleasant
episode Just after the finish. His mount \u25a0
bolted to the outside fence, and in the j
mix-up McÃride luckily escaped with
a bruised foot. The accident kept him
out of the 6ad<Sle the balance of the j
afternoon. ,
J. J. Walsh made his California debut |
\u2666n the back ot'Mlss Curry. The New
Torker Â«ustalned no Injury, and later
on piloted Red Reynard.
Elerea Bells, second choice in the
third race, was buffeted about at the
first turn, after which W. Smith made
&o move with the mare. If all riders
were like Smith bookmaklng would be
a grand business. Owner Davies should
Impress on his apprentice that perse

EX-CHAMPION IS SATISFIED
WITH HIS TRAINING.
SIXEWY ARMS OF THE SPRIGHTLY PHILADELPHIAN* "WHO "WILL MEET 808 FITZSIMMONS IN THE TOSEMITB CLUB
RING IN MECHANICS' PAVILION NEXT- WEDNESDAY NIGHT. IN WHAT PROMISES TO BE AN EXCITING FIGHT.
THE CORNISHMAN SAYS THIS IS TO BE HIS FAREWELL. APPEARANCE.
LIKELY BOXERS
ARE SUSPENDED
IJegisi ration Committee Ke-
I'iiscs to Countenance
Infractions of the Eules
The registration committee of the Pa
cific Athletic Association pulled the
strings around amateur- fighting a little
tighter la?t night.. when the members put
a rule into effect which prohibits the clubs
giving? amateitr contests paying contest
ants money for training expenses. An
other clause in the rules, that v.-I!l also
\u25a0work hardships on the so"-^-alled amateur
boxers and the club managers is that the
club must show the committee the tro
phies that are to be given as prizes. Th=
value of each must be within $15 and $33;
If not they will be rejected.
The"^ ofiices of the committee at Â«420
Montgomery street were filled last night
with amateur boxers who were notified to
appear and show the prizes they have My-un
during the last year. Tne array of tro
phies, medals and jewelry they -brought
with them looked like a cross between a
Third-street pawn shop and a 5-cent grab
box. Some of the pugnacious lads con
fessed they won enough jewelry with their
"dukes" to (supply aU members of the
family with gold trinkets. Kyle Whitney
(colored) showed six stickpins won by him
in ring combats. They ranged In value
from 25 cents up.
FRISKS ARI-i CALLED FOR.
It is the rule of the association for clubs
to make a statement after each exhibi
tion of the nature of the prizes awarded
the contestants. When the various boxers
were asked last night to show what they
had received as prizes during - contests
which took place during the last year
many of them were caught in a trap
which resulted In their suspension.
Willie Wolff, who recently won a cham
pionship at the Olympic Club, was one of
these. Willie was one of the boys who
won enough articles to start a jewelry
shop. Willie was down on the list for
receiving cuff- bottons in one of his con
tests. He confessed me prize given him
was a scarfpin. It Is likely Willie forgot
to say what the club manager, told him.
Others who were suspended for making
the same fatal mistake were Jack Mc
laughlin, the English boxer; Harry
Becker, J. Ford, W. Dempsey, Smiling
Jim Kane and B. Casini.
Tho last named youth frankly admitted
that the>only evidence he could show of
some of the prizes he had won were a* few
pawn tickets. He said he was pinched at
times for ready cash and found they were
nearly as good as a meal ticket.
MANAGER IS INTERESTED.
Al Young,*manager of the Hawthorne
Club, the organization which is making
tremendous profits out of the amateur
boxers at present, was present to look af
ter the interests of his organization. Dur
ing the course of the examination of the
boxers as to their genuineness as ama
teurs many of them looked appealingly
at him for advice. The best Al could do
was to make a few expressionsâ some of
which the boys seemed to read. Many
applications were received for amateur
cards.
Choynakl Sues Graney.
The dispute between Joe Choynskl, pu
gilist, and Eddie Graney, referee, over
$254 50 that changed hands as a result
of the Choynski-Sharkey prize fight in
1898 was argued and submitted for de
cision before Judge Sloss yesterday.
Choynskl' claims that Graney borrowed
the money from him. and Graney con
tends that while he received the money
he In fact placed it with the club. that
gave the fight as a forfeit to secure
Choynski's appearance, and that when
Sharkey won the fight the money was
paid to him by mistake, together with
his share of the receipts. If anybody
Is responsible for the loss of the money.
Graney says it is either the club that
gave the fight or Sharkey himself .
Old-Tloic Boxer l:c Jnll.
NEW YORK, Dec. li.â William Mur
phy, once well known in the prize ring
as! a clever * boxer, under, the name of
"Australian Billy" Murphy, but now
homeless, penniless and anxious :to get
back to Australia, was ; arraigned before
Magistrate Stein in Morrisiana Police
Court to-day, charged with stealing
Christmas ' trees from a car ln the Har
lem River yards . of the New York, New
Haven and Hartford Railroad. He was

Shows Much Better Form Than When
He Prepared for Gardner.
There was no change in the betting sit
uation on the O'Brien-Fitzsimmons fight
yesterday, the sprightly Philadelphlan re
maining favorite in what little wagering
was done. It was a surprise to many to
find Fjtzsimmons a lens shot, although
George Gardner ruled a 6 to 10 choice over
him at one time before their fight in this
city. . .
On the former occasion Fltzslmmons
knew he was not at his best and publicly
advised his friends not to bet on him.
lie proved good enough to win from
Gardner after landing a right to the head
which filled the Lowell boxer with awe
and with respect.
Three years ago Fitz made a brilliant
showing with the Invincible, all-conquer
ing- Jeffries. His friends cannot believe
he* has gone back so far since then as ti>
making it possible for O"Brien to defeat
him: His training work shows he la as fit
as it is possible for his trainers to make
him.
Fitzstmmons* relish for training work
and the apparent satisfaction and enjoy
ment he derives from his strenuous pre
paratory exercising Is the envy of many
a younger boxer and the admiration of
the legion of followers of the tried and
seasoned veteran of the roped arena.' Fltx
has never been a shirker ln* getting him
self into battling trim and if there is any
thing he likâ¬s more than training It is a
real prize fight. Even now a well placed
wallop with driving force behind it land
ing on the fighting section of Fitz's anat
omy rouses the spirit of conflict ln the ex
champlon of the world and transforms
him instantly into a dangerous opponent-
He asserts he is at present in far supe
rior condition than he was when he
fought George Gardner. The weather haa
been ideal for road work. The bracing
mornings and beautiful avenues of Ala
meda have had an Irresistible attraction
for Fitz and he has made the most of
these advantages in his training.
Countering and footwork were the fea
tures of Fitz's secret training work yes
terday. The freckled fighter remarked at
the conclusion of six rounds with Billy
Bates and Harry Chester, each golns
three periods, that he" felt he had pro3ted
much by the exercising, as it had ln-

creased his speed and made his flat aim
more accurate. While his opponent was
ln front of him. Bob would count one;
two. three, his sparring mate at the same
time leading twice with the left and onw
with the right. Fitz would counter the
punches and in turn would let drive ;i
pair of lefts and a right at the man in
front of him. This programme was car
ried out from the four corners of the
ring for six innings. Fltzsimmons usc-1
this system many years ago. when he was
a lightweight in training. Yesterday was
the first time that he had tried it since
he began to battle heavy-weights. Prior
to slipping on the gloves to mix it with
his boxing partners Fitz slam-banged the
bag for a half hour without once pausing
to replenish his breath supply. He oper
ated more smoothly as he warmed up and
the perspiration flowed in a healthy cur
rent. In the morning Bob took his usual
jaunt on the" highways and with his char
acteristic side-legged swing covered ten
miles. To-day Bob will continue his pri
vate practice in the afternoon. To-mor
row and Sunday he will resuma bis train
ing in public.
Sam Berger will shine as an actor with
Bob Fitzsimmons at the Alhambra and
will lend his might to the elevation of the
stage. Sam has a long part to memorize
ahd is also called upon to box three
rounds with Fltzsimmons. He is to re
ceive $200 for one week's work. Bam says
$50 will cover the boxing end of his part,
while he thinks he will earn ths remain
der with his acting.
Al Kaufinann has recovered from, his
unpleasant experience with Jack <yÃrlen
and wants to settle down to work again
in the ring. He has aereed to meet Billy
Bates, who is acting as Fitzsiminons'
sparring mate, before the . Colma Club
next month. Bates has the match under
consideration. He is the man who fought
Andy Gallagher in the Olympic Club. He
won after a desperate fight, but it was
proved he was a "ringer," having been a
professional in the north. The valuable
cup was awarded to Gallagher.

Lyr.aia. which arrived Wednesday even
ing from the Philippines, broke all trans
port records for the run between Hono

45 minutes, and but for several days of

and COl enlisted men of the Seventh In
fantry. The Seventh Infantry is home
after nearly three years' service in the
tropics. The Seventh goes from here to
Montana, where, amidst the snow and
ice, those that escape pneumonia will be
able to forget the warmth of the Philip
pines. ' !
At Nagasaki a prisoner, Peterson by
name, escaped from, the transport and
had not been found when the Thomas
sailed from the Japanese port.
The Thomas brought several passen
g-ers and about ten tons of army stores
from Honolulu. The passengers from
Honolulu were: Captain R. I* Bush of

Captain of -Manchuria Has
Engaged George Knight
FINDS FAVOBABLE CASE
District Judge Wheeler of
New York Decides That
Perjury Does Not Vitiate
Although the United States secret ser
vice people say they have evidence that
Captain James William Saunders. master
of the steamship Manchuria, was not en
titled to be naturalized at the time his
certificate of citizenship was given to him
in the New York Superior Court, it is
likely that they will not succeed in hav
ing that certificate canceled.
Captain Saunders has engaged Attorney
Georgo A. Knight to defend his interests,
and Knight said yesterday that under the
decision of the United States Circuit
Court of New York in the case of the
United States against Gleason, as re
ported in the 7&th volume of the Federal
Reporter, the judgment cannot be dis
turbed.
The fact was admitted that Gleason had
knowingly and falsely sworn that he had
resided in the United States for three
years before becoming of age, but the
decision holds that the perjury was im
material to the issue as to whether the
judgment of the Superior Court admit
ting him to citizenship should stand. The
syllabus says:
The administration of the oaths and issuing:
of the certificate to the applicant for natural
ization by a court having Jurisdiction of eucb
applications constitute a judgment of admis
sion to citizenship which is conclusive as to
the existence of the necessary facta and the
status of the applicant. Such certificate can
not be set aside upon the grounds that tho
facts were falsely represented to the court.
The decision was rendered on January
30, 1597, by United States District Judge
Wheeler, sitting in the Circuit Court.
The dispute in the case of Captain
Saundors, who was naturalized as a
minor on June 22, ISS6, is as -to his resi
dence. When a boy he arrived at Boston
on an English ship and cruised between
Boston and a foreign port In British
ships.
He considered that his landing at Bos
ton when returning from such trips was
equivalent to a residence. This is dis
puted by Assistant United States District
Attorney A. P. Black and United States
Secret Service Agent Taylor. Mr. Black
has taken the matter under advisement,
in hope that he may find some other de
cision that may contradict that of Judge
Wheeler. !

COPPER POOL
GETS SETBACK
Lawson Announces That the
Operations of His Combine
Have Not Been Successful
LOSES NEAKLY $4,000,000
Nothing Daunted the Boston
Millionaire Invites Sub
scriptions to a New Fund
Special Dlspatcb to The Call.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 14.â Thomas W.
Lawson and his "Ten Million Dollar Bear
Pool" have been badly punished in the
late- market boom, particularly In the
"coppers," and to-day he issued ay mod
est announcement to the effect that the
pool has sustained a loss of $3,600,000 In
Its operations, or 46 per cent. In the
same breath he announced the formation
of a new and still greater pool of $15,000,
000 to begrln Friday,- December 15, and in
vites subscriptions to the same. "Whether
he thinks that those who sustained losses
as his associates In the previous opera
tions in his scheme of "selling: stocks to
the system" will bear their losses with
equanimity and put up additional funds
is a problem.
Compared with h!shalf-pagÂ» and full
page announcements beginning: a year ago
and continuing through the summer of
what was going to be done to the "sys
te*m" the announcement to-day is modest
indeed. It Is as a "gentle summer zephyr
against a. Kansas cyclone. In his notice
Lawson does not take the trouble to ex
plain the losses in detail. It apparently
was a gigantic blind pool in which the
participators had not a voice, but the
cause is easily traceable In the record of
Lawson's operations in Amalgamated
Smelters and Copper Range against tho
steady rise in price of the first two
named, particularly since he began pre
dicting dire disaster for them. /
Amalgamated crossing par was the last
straw. He still predicts 200 for -Copper
Range, but as a predictor Lawson has not
made good. Lawson's detailed statement
indicates that $1,200,000 of the pool's total
loss was caused by deals in copper metal
and the balance in stocks. He stronsly
urges Trinity stockholders to keep their
stock, promising an early statement re
garding it. â¢ â¢

In Quick Alarm. . \u25a0
A small fire, which might have been
very serious but for the prompt action
of a passing street car conductor,
broke out on the top floor of. the mil
linery establishment of Henz 6c Llndt
at 541-543 Market street about 10
o'clock last night. The total damage
was about $100. The fire started from
the crossing of the -electric wires lead-
Ing to an Iron heater.
A conductor on a. Halght-street car
was passing by and saw the smoke
curling up from the top story of the
building. He stopped the car and gave
the alarm at once. The firemen arrived
promptly and put out the blaze in a
few minutes. On the floor lay enough
loose waste material to have burned a
dozen buildings.

FATHER MAHOXY LECTURES
OX INTERESTING SUBJECT
Choose* for His Theme, "Socialism nnd
the Catholic Church," at St. Peter's
Pariah Hall.
The Hex. Father TV. Mahony, profes
sor bf moral philosophy at St. Ignatius
College, lectured last night at St. Pe
ter's Parish Hall, under the auspices of
Sheridan Council, T. M. I.
His subject was "Socialism and the
Catholic Church." He stated the posi
tion of Socialism regarding the pur
poses of life, showing that it was com
pletely taken up and absorbed- by pure
ly material considerations and conse
quently it eliminated all spiritual ele
ment in men and in the aim of life.
Father Mahony contrasted this with
the Catholic position on the aim of life
and showed tnat the church, while .ac
knowledging that temporal interests
have a great claim on man, since he is
composed of both body and soul, yet
spirituar interests must form his chief
concern.
The lecturer then passed on to show
that in the Socialistic system the state
and the family were based upon mere
temporal consideration and were pure
inventions of man caused by his mate
rial condition and the material changes
occurring in his environment
Over against this he set the teach
ings of the church on the state of the

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON. Dec 14-â After the rapid advanes
of the past three days the overdue reaction
occurred to-day. The market seemed full of
stop orders. A stop order for one thousand
shares at S9 in Nwth Butte was. caught and
tfce trade broke the price to 86 before It \u25a0could
be executed A sharp rally followed as sup-
I^rtins orders came in, but the etock sagged
off at the close. Copper Range, which has
been liquidated freely In the past few days,
was slightly weaker. The market had every
appearance of halting for the present.
\u25a0weakmÂ«s in North Butte was due to the over
advances.
LawEcn has sent notice to his pool members
of a loss of 36 per cent, cf which $2,400,000
was lost in etocks and $1,200! 000 in copper
metals. He gives pool members the right to
withdraw If they desire.

The feature at the moment Is the growing
firmness in Prunes. Tho New York Journal of
Commerce cays:
"In the general line the most active article
on the list at present is California Prunes,
and, though there is a strong demand for spot
goods, Individual orders seldom call for more
than one -or two hundred boxes. So far as can
be learned, there Is no lnqulrv for forward
shipments from the coast* at present, but hold
ers there arÂ« represented to be Indifferent sell
ers, as stocks are reduced to unusually small
proportions. According to some reports, not
ever 100 cars remain unsold in the Santa Clara
Valley and the stock outside is tali to be net
over 50 Shippers now quote B%e 1. 0. b.
basis on Santa Clara stock, and It la held to
be very doubtful whether this price would be
shaded even on tho more plentiful sizes. There
Is very little of the Oregon Italian crop left on
the Â©cast. Spot . prices are very firm at the
quotation* and ther* Is a fair demand."

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
EDWARD E. CLARK HEROICALLY
SAVES LIFE OF DROWNING MAN.
Edward E. Clark, a courageous Southern Pacific brakeman, heroically plunged into the estuary from a moving train yester
day and saved W. J. Harries from drowning. Harries, who could not swim, had plunged into the water to escape death
under the wheels of an oncoming train which he had been trying to flag with his coat. . â¢ .>
Brakeman Rescues W.
J. Harries From
the Estuary.
Victim of Accident
Jumps to Avoid
Train.
His Savior Leaps From
the Moving Car
Into Bay.
OAKLAND, Dec. 14.â Terrified by the
rarid approach of the 9 o'clock west
botmd local train, and fearing that he
would be ground to pieces beneath the
jionderous wheels of the locomotive if he
remained where he was, W. J. Harries,
r carpenter and builder, residing at the
Nevada House, leaped from the Seventh
street trestle, between Oak street and
Clinton station, and but for the heroism
of Edward E. Ciark, a brakeman on the
train, would have drowned before assist
ance \u25a0 could have reached him from the
shore.
Repeated blasts of the locomotive whis
tle called Clark's attention to the fact
that something was wrong, and he ran
out on the platform of the oar In which
lie was riding Just in time to see Harries,
who could no iswlm a stroke, sink beneath
the surface of the water.
Without a moment's hesitation, Clark
threw oft his coat and vest, and leaped
frcm the platform of the train, which
had not yet been brought to a standstill,
straight Into the water. After a
hard struggle to release himself frem the
grip cf the mud, which he had struck in
jumping from the train, the brakeman
reached Harries, and raising hie head and
the upper part of hie body from the water,
Blowly made his way to the shore.
As soon as he reached the fhore Harries
was placed on the train and taken to
Seventh and Broadway. He was removed
to the Receiving Hospital by Deputy
Sheriff J. H. Reilly and Train Gateman
A. Altier, who had aided Clark to carry
the man to the train.
Harries was under the influence of
liquor at the time of the accident and
for some time after he was taken to
the hospital he was unable to give a
lucid account of himself. After he had
somewhat recovered he said that his home
was in Wales and that he had formerly
lived at the Commercial Hotel in San
Francisco.
When overtaken by the train which so
nearly caused his death, Harries was on
his way to his room at the Nex'ada House,
and had taken a short cut across the
trestle, being- unacquainted with the run
ning time of the trains and thinking that
he w-iuld have plenty time to crO6S. As
he reached a point about 300 yards from
the wcetprn end of the trestle the west
bound train started across from the op
posite end. Hearing the roar of the ap
proaching train, Harries took off his coat
and attempted to stop the train, but,
being frightened at its rapid approach,
leaped from the trestle before it reached
him.
"When searched at the Receiving Hospi
tal a slirÂ» of paper bearing the address
ot Miss Blanche Moore, care of the Wood
ruff House. I^2 Taylor street, San Fran
cisco, was found in one of his pockets.
Edward E. Clark, the brakeman to
whom Harries owes his escape from
death, has been in the employ of the
Southern Pacific Company for several
years, and is considered one of the best
and coolest men in the service. He re
sides at 561 East Eleventh street, in East
Oakland. He v.a& none the worse for his
thrilling leap from the train and his
ducking in the cold water, and continued
his work after he had obtained dry cloth
ing.
LOUISE BENSON
SAYS DIVORCE
IS NECESSARY
BER-KKHjET. Dec. 14. â Clubwomen of Berke
ley to the number of a hundred or more
listened this afternoon to a seneatlosal paper
on "Diroroe,, K&ce Suicide and Marriage," pre

town had invited Mrs. Benson to address its
members upon the subject of marriage and' di
vorce. The Hall home, on Hillside avenue
and Channln? way buzzed with excitement
<"urlng and after the reading of Mrs. Benson's
paper The- author vigorously defended wom
en's clubs from the assertions heard from tuch
citizens as Grover Cleveland and others, who
believe that ill and not good results from tho
organizations of women which are exclusively
feminine in make-up.
Mrs. Benson ceclared that there should be
restrictions upon the marriage of the unfit,
tnd. lacking such restrictions, divorce must
be toleratt<d as a cure for a social disease.
Divorce, the declared. Is not a menace to eoclai
morality. It :Â» a remedy that is demanded by
k social disease.
Failure to inform the young of both sexes
of what should be moral standards before mar
riage was eaid to be responsible for the preva
lence of divorce cas*Â«. Incidentally Mrs. Ben
eon announced her conviction that racÂ« cuiclde
which is Induced by political corruption'
vicious living end wax, may result eventually
In the fiotnlnance of the black and yellow
races Â«n<l the subjugation of the Anglo-Saxon
Mrs. Benson quoted Professor Huxley and
Count Toletoy In support of her theory that
"the birth rat* Is determined in great meas
ure, not only by the social forces, but by cer
tain mysterious forces of civilization, so reys
uirioue ma to defy exact definition," these
force* now operating at high pressure in Eu
iope and America. ,
Mrs. Benaon argued for women's participa
tion In law-making powerm. especially where
lawÂ« that bear most directly upon women's
Interests ere concerned. In this connection
Mrs. Aiwtln Bperry of 2100 Pacific avnut !n
San Francisco, president of the California
Equal Suffrage Association, announced that thÂ»
association has sent letters to the Governors
of all States, requesting that women members
be placed on the Bt*te delegations which will
make tip the national convention on divorce, to
be held in Washington, D. C. in February of
next year.
