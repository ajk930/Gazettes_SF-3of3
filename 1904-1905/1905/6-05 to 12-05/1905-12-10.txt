CHAPTER 111.
|t Hotv Mr. Gvrrnn Dlaed With the
Harieys.
<~w >'V man who says that be is a
f I gentleman is not a gentleman.
| I A pentleman no more tells you
>â¢ I tliat be is a gentleman than a
brave man tells you he is brave.
Gentility Is a quality which- the
possessor never seeks to estab
fisli as his own by word of mouth;
lie leaves it to inference and the rule
has no exception. This brilliant Bpeech
lossness arises not through modesty,
but Ignorance. However clearly gen
tility reveals itself to others, he who
possesses it has no more knowledge
on that faultless point than have your
hille of the yellow gold they hold with
in their breasts.
Storri *yas one.who.went/ar and^fre- '
{.uejitlj- out '-at hia conversational way.
to assure you that he was a gentleman.
Though he did no mere than Just re
count how he gave his seat to a woman
in a car, or passed the salt at. dinner,
-or made a morning call, somewhere la
the narrative you were sure . to hear
that he was "a gentleman," or "a Rus
sian gentleman," commonly the latter;
End he always accompanied the news
with a straightening- of his heavy
shoulders and a threatening pull at- his
mustache as though he expected tb find
his word disputed and planned a ter
rible return. â¢
It could not be called Storrl's fault
that it was not three hundred years
since his forebears wore sheepskins,
carried clubs, and made a fire by ju
diciously rubbing one stick against an
other. None the less this nearness to
a stone age left him barbarous in his
heart; and the layer of civilization that
was upon him was not a layer, but a
polish â a sheen, and neither so thick
nof to tangible as moonshine on 'a
lake. Tbe savageries of Richard were
quite as vivid as Storri' s, perhaps; but at
least they had been advantageously hid
den beneath a top-dressing of eleven civil
izing* centuries Instead of three;' and
those eight extra centuries made all the
difference In life. They gave Richard
steadiness and self-control; for the first
separation between civilization and bar
barism lies in this, that a civilized man
is mere readily quieted after a stampede
than Is your barbarous one. Also he Is
not bo wide open to original surprise.
Wherefore, when Richard and Storri
stood glaring at cne another after the
episode of the hands, Richard had vastly
the better of Storri, who fell into a three
â¢ ply mood of amazement, fright and rage.
Finally. Storri seemed to mutter threats
while be retreated; and at last got him
self out of the Harley front door in rath
er an incoherent way. It was understood
that he tmlmbled "Good-afternoon!" to
Dorothy, and that "he would talk with
him again," to Richard, and all as he
found his hat with his left hand, the
L right meanwhile wrapped In a handker-
which was a smudge of blood: It
could not be described as a graceful exit
and had many of the features of a rout,
but it was effective, and took Storri
successfully Into the street Dorothy,
still transfixed, turned -Triih round eyes
to Richard: ,'1 : ,_Â»
- "What was it you did?" she .asked
a^lt\aB nothing." replied Richard with
a shrug. "Or if anything, then a. piece
â¢ of primitive sarcasm. Really. II f m_ sorry,
since you were here; but I had no choice.
"Will there be a duel?" gurgled Doro
thy, catching her breath. .
Dorothy, among other valuable ideas
derived from novels, had gained a miudle
agc impression that made flashing blades
and gaping wounds a romantic, probabil
1 "'storrt is not so self-sacrificing." re
turned Richard with a grin, "and I. am
' much too modern." Then in a bantering
tone: "How much better was the old
day when men might differ nobly foot
to foot, with the fair lady to the victor
and a funeral to the vanquished as the
natural upshot. It is' too bad! In the
name of progress we have come too far
and thrown away too much!"
It was among the marvels how Richard
changed. As he talked with Dorothy
those eyes, late flint, became tender ana
laughingly honest in a fashion- good^to
et-e. He appeared younger by half, for
anger is ancient and. piles on the. Rears.
"Really, Miss Harley." continued Rlch-^
. ard, â¢ with a heroic â¢ determination* to
/change the subject, "I haven't as yet paid
Vty respects to you. Your mother J said :
/^\u25a0iritght calL She was very kind !*' ~'_ And
here Richard pressed \the little hand in
that one which had so discouraged -Stbr
ri, while Mrs. Hanway-Harley suddenly
Â«vept into the room as If "Mother" were
J^cr cue.
"Mamma," cried Dorothy," presenting
The Sunday Call Magazine
Richard, "this is Mr. Storms. You re
member; he saved myâmy nose."
Certainly Mrs. Hanway-Harley remem
bered. She recalled the event in a man
ner superbly amiable and condescending.
"And you told us then," said Mrs. Han
way-Harley, "that you would presently
dwell in Washington. Is it your plan to
make the town your permanent resi
dence?"
\u25a0 "My plans depen* on vie plans of
others, madam. I have become chained to
their chariot and cannot call myself free."
Here Richard looked audaciously slyly
at Dorothy, who Interested herself with
certain flowers that stood in the window.
"Ah! I see," returned Mrs.' Hanway-
Hafley. who did not see at all. "You
mean Mr. Gwynn." She nafi heard of
Mr. Gwynn, so far as the town know that
personage, from her husband. "But you
said 'others'?"
"Yes, madam; beside} Mr. Gwynn, there
are Matzai and Mr. Pickwick." Then,
responding to Mrs.' Hanway-Harley's in
quiring brows/Richard went forward with
explanations. "Matzai is my valet, while
Mr. Pickwick Is a terrier torn by an im
placable hatred of rats: which latter Is
the more strange, madam, for I give you
my word Mr. Pickwick never saw a rat in
his life."V
"What an extraordinary young man!"
ruminated Mrs. Hanway-Harley. and she
bestowed upon Richard a searching glance
to see if .by any miracle of - Impertinence
he was poking" fun at her. â¢
. That well-balanced <â¢ gentleman realized
the peril, and faced it with a countenance
as blankly, not to say as blandly-vacu
ous as the ; wrong '-. side of a' tombstone;
Ho ran thÂ«^ less risk; for the ; lady could
not conceive how any one dare take -so
gross J a liberty with a Hanway-Harley;
one,' too, .-whose future tremendous
chances jot - a .' WJjlte- Housc.t Being i satis
fied of ' Richard's seriousness, _â¢ and * ;eoh
cluding privily that he; was only? a dull
ard whom the honor of -her ' notice had
confused, she said:. â¢ â¢ \u25a0;:..-\u25a0- \Ug?i
."Uxnph! Matzai and Mr. - r Pickwick!
Yes; certainly!" \u25a0 '- \u25a0 \u25a0":- } .A" - â¢. c?
Then Mrs. Hanway-Harley â¢ set . herself
to ask questions; the â¢ bald aggressiveness
whereof j gave the daugnter a red I brow.
Richard answered readily, as though glad
of the chance, and did not notice the
crimson that painted Dorothy's face."
The latter young lady was as much puz
zled by their caller as was her mother,
without accounting for V his ; oddities \u25a0 on
any argument of dullness. Ipdeed, she
could see how he played, with them: that
there flowed ag, undercurrent of irony In
his replies. Moreover, while by his man
ner he had pedestaled and prayed to her
as to a goddess, when they were alone and
before her mother came, Dorothy now ob
served that Richard carried himself In a
manner easy and masterful, and as one
who knows much In the presence of ones
who know little.- This air. of the ineffa
bly invincible made Dorothy forget, the
adoration which had aforetlmes glowed in
his eyes, and she longed to box his ears.
"Is Mr. Gwynn your relative?" asked
the cool, though somewhat careless, Mrs.
Hanway-Harley.
"No, madam; no relative." There
drifted about "the corners of Richard's
mouth the shadow of a smile. "He is all
English; I am 'all American."
"I'm sure I'm sorry." remarked the lady
musingly. Then without saying; upon
what her . sorrow : was hinged, she pro
â¢ ceeded. "Mr. - Gwynn, 'l hearâ l don't
know him personally, but hope 6oon to
have that pleasureâ ls - a- gentleman of
highest breeding. My brother assures. me
that he has most .delightful manners. I
know I shall adore him. If there's any
thing I wholly admire it is an old-school
English gentlemanâ they nave so much
refinement, so much elevation!"
"It might not become me," returned
Richard, in. what Mrs. Hanway-Harley
took to be a spirit of diffidence, "to laud,
the deportment of Mr. Gwynn. But .what
should you expect in one who all his life
has had about him the best society of
England?" . . \ . ,
"Ah! I can see you like . himâ venerate
him!" This with ardor. V â¢
"I won't answer : for the veneration,"
relumed Richard. "I like him^ well
enoughâ as Mr. Gwynn." - c -:
Mrs. Hanway-Harley stared in matronly,
reproof.
"You don't appear over "grateful to your
benefactor." ' \u25a0 : ~
"No;" and, Richard shook his head^'Tm
quite the churl, I know; but I can't help
v." . ' \u25a0' -, \u25a0 .â¢\u25a0;/'. -.'\u25a0
Richard found a chance to say to Dor
othy, VI see that you love flowers." ...
This was when Dorothy had taken ref
uge among. those blossoms.
"I worship flowers," returned Dorothy.
\u25a0 "Now I don't worider," exclaimed Rich
ard. "You and they have -so much \u25a0in
common." : , <
Mrs. Hanway-Harley f was for. -"the" mo--,
ment preoccupied^ with: thoughts of \u25a0Mr* 1
Gwynn, and .plans for the ' small Senate
dinner at which i that austere gentleman
would find himself: in the: place of honor.
However, she caught some flash of Rich
ard's remark. For the fraction of an in
stant it bred "a doubt oft. his -dullness.:
What \u25a0 if he should come philandering
after Dorothy? Mrs. } Hanway-Harley's
feathers began to rise. No beggar, fed ; by
charity need , hope for her â¢ daughter's
hand; she .was firm -set as to; that." "Per
haps Mr. Gwynn '_ intended =to \u25a0 make him
rich by his, will. At this Mrs.'. Hanway-
Harley*s ' feathers - â¢ showed , less * excite
ment. "Mr. Gwynn should be" sounded' on
the subject of bequests. 'Why liot'put the
question to Mr. .Storms? .'", lt would'; at
least lead to â¢"- the : development iof \u25a0 , that
equivocal 'gentleman's -expectations. ;\u25a0'..
\u25a0 % VHas Mr.^Gwynn: any' family. In Eng-.
lan4?" ' asked Mrs. 7 Hanway-Harley.",,^";*"
. "A" nephew or two.^l ;belleve; possibly; a
brother/' *" ' â¢\u25a0-"' "\u25a0:/ \'i>"\ \u25a0'\u25a0'*
f "But . he", will make v you i his , heir." â¢
.'- "Mef 1 ' Richard [ gave ." a j negative shake
of <\u25a0 the .head. "The", old fellow .pii'buldn't
leave mea shilling. s Why should ; he? I Nor
would '\u25a0 I â¢ accept it', if <he - did." l* Richard's
sidelong look at Mrs. Hanway-Harley. was

full of amusement. "No, the old rogue
bates me, if he would but tell the truthâ
which he won'tâ and If it were worth jny
while' and compatible with my self-re
spect, I've no doubt I'd \u25a0 hate him.'.'
This sentiment was delivered with the
blase air of weariness worn out, that
should belong with him who. has seen
and heard ' and known a world's f multi
tude; which manner, is everywhere recog
*nized as the very flower of good breeding. -
*Mrs. Hanway-Harley/ sat tongue-tied '
with astonishment. In 1 the end she \u25a0 re-c
called herself. , "Mrs.; Hanway-Harley <
scented nothing perilous in the j situation.
In any event, Dorothy would wed whom
soever-she decreed," Mrs. Hanway^-Harley;
was deservedly., certain of '\u25a0 that. While ;
this cam,e to her mind, Richard the enter
prising went laying plans for the j daily .
'desolation of an entire" greenhouse. : ;
"Dorothy," observed ; - Mrs.-' Hanway-
Harley, after Richard had gone his way,
"there' you -have, a young -man remark
able for two things; his dullness and. his .'
effrontery." Did | you r hear - how j he- spoke
of his benefactor? The -wretch! .After

"How do you â¢ know what Mr. Gwynn
has done for him?"""/ V
Dorothy, while she" confessed the jus
tice* of her mother's strictures, felt-un
commonly inclined to defend the absent
j one. Her memory of those tender glances
was coming back. . .^' "
\u25a0â¢: "Why, it -is, all. over town! Mr. Storms
\u25a0 is dependent on Mr.* Gwynn/ By the way,

""her horrified hands. "Oh! the callousness
of children!", she cried. ; Following this
outburst of despair, Mrs.". Hanway-Harley â¢
composed herself. "We need not consider
that now; it will' be soon enough, when
the f Count offers us hia hand." Mrs.
Hanway-Harley sank back { In " her chair

Mr.' Harley drank twice as much wine. to

Mr.'.Gwynn bowed his thanks. . It should

CHAPTER IV.
How a Speakerahlp Wan Fought For.
Fate now and then turns jester in a bit
ter way, and stoops to Ironies and grin
ning sarcasm. Often it gives with the
right hand onlj-j to take with the left, and
blinded ones are set to chop and saw and
pl?.ne those trees which In the end make
pailows for their hopes. The story of the
world shows many an inadvertent Frank
enstein and deeply justifies the grewsome
Mrs. Shelley.
Something less than two years prior to
that evening when Senator Hanway took
the congealed Mr. Gwynn into a corner
and told him how, with his great Anacon
da Airline, he should cut a figure in the
selection of a next Speaker for the House
of Representatives, .it had been that
statesman's fortune to so reconstruct a
tariff that it gave unusual riches and
thereby unusual comfort to the dominant
ones of a certain manufacturing North
eastern State. This commonwealth at the
time was politically in the hands of the
party opposed to Senator Hanway. MolII
i:ed by the friendly tariff and anxious to
mark their gratitude, those domi
nant ones arose and in the fol
lowing autumn elected to be Governor
of said State a middle-aged individual,
eminent {<$r obstinacy and a kind of
bovine integrity that nothing might cor
rupt or turn aside. The Obstinate One
of course, belonged with the party of
Senator Hanway.
At this pinch a vile chance befell. No
sooner was the Obstinate One given the
Governorship of a State doubtful and ac
counted the enemy's country than
straightway he was looked upon as
White House timber by sundo' architects
of politics, and thereafter his name went
more or less linked with a possible Presi
dency. The situation stirred the spleen
of Senator Hanway. It was discouraging
to have those identical tariff triumphs,
which had been Intended as an argu
ment favorable to* himself, give birth to
a rival; one also who, for his geography
and the popularity which those personal
obstinacies and thick-skulled integrities
invoked, might work a great disturbance
in his plans. To make bad worse, the
Obstinate One possessed a sinister luck
of his own and with closed eyes backed
into a fight on the right side and won it
against a pack of lobby wolves who were
yelping and snapping about the State
treasury. This, although the Obstinate
One of all men least appreciated what
he had done, confirmed him as a val
uable asset of party; pending further
honors the public to reward him gave,
him the title of Governor Obstinate.
In his white, still, rippleless way. Sen
ator Hanway hated in his soul's soul the
name of Governor Obstinate. Night and
day h<Â« carried that dull, fortunate gentle-,
man on his swell of thought and never
ceased to consider how he might deal him
a blow or withstand him in any Presi
dential stepping forward. And yet at
no time had Senator Hanwayâ and him
self the master of every art of cord
and creese In politic?â felt more helpless.
If Governor Obstinate had been no more
than jU6t a finished politician, a mere
Crillon of political fence. Senator Han
way might have flashed his ready point
between his ribs. But the other's very
crudities defended him. He was primitive
to the verge of despair. Even his strength
was primitive, inasmuch as it dwelt
among the people rather . than with \u25a0 the
machinists of party. Senator Hanway's
monkish brow went often puckered of
a most uncanonical frown as he thought
upon that sardonic Destiny which {-had,
t hrust this Governor Obstinate ! forward
to become a stumbling block, in his way.
In. his angry contempt he could compare
him to nothing save a grizzly bear-
Whatever the justice of this last' shaggy
simile, even Senator Hanway could not
deny its formidable side. A grizzly,
whether in fact or in hyperbole,, is no.
one good to meet. There is a supremacy
of the primitive; when the natural and
the artificial have collided the latter has
more than once come limping- off. Our
soldiers cannot make the Indians fight
their fashion; the Indians make the sol
diers fight their fashion. \u25a0 If the soldiers
were dense enough to insist upon their
formation, the Indiansâ fighting all over
the field and each red warrior for him
selfâwould an them as full of holes as
a colander. When, therefore. Senator
Hanway called Governor Obstinate a
grizzly, it was a name of respect. The
usual methods would not prevail in his
stubborn case. Most of all, money could
not.be employed to overthrow him; for
his foundations. like the foundations of
any other grizzly, were original ; and be
yond the touch of money. -- â *
Now all this served to palsy the
strength of Senator Hanway. In one
shape or another, and whether by prom
ise or actual present production, money
was his one great tool, and where the
tool has lost its power the artisan is
also powerless. It is- not to Senator Han
way's discredit that he would fail where
money failed; Richelieu, wanting money;
would have been a turtle on Its , back.:
Wherefore, let It be rewritten that Sen
ator Han way in the face of those' clumsy,
uncouth, half-seeing yet tremendous po
tentialities of his enemy was seized of a
helplessness never before I felt To op
pose the other with only those narrow
means of money was like trying to put
down a Sioux uprising with a resolution
of the Board of .Trade. Still, he must
do his best; he must hold this Governor
Obstinate as much as he might In check,
trusting to the chapter of accidents,
which in politics is a very lair of sur
prises, to suggest final ways and means
to baffle his advance.
For the business of making him Presi
dent, the complacent Senate had become
the workshop of Senator Hanway. Now,,
on the brink of a new Congress, one
which would be in session when the
nominating convention of his party was
called to order and therefore might be
supposed to own power over its action
and the Presidential ticket It would put
up. Senator Hanway resolved to add the
House of Representatives to his ma
chine. He would elect its Speaker, and
make the House an annex to his work
shop of a Senate. He would hook up
House and Senate as a coachman hooks
up his team, and driving them tandem
or abreast as the exigencies of the hbur
suggested, see how far two such power
ful agencies might take him on his White
House road. '.-\u25a0-.: t
It was on the side of Senator Hanway
a* brilliant thought and a daring one,
this plan to seize a Speakership and ap
ply it to his personal fortunes; for your
Speakership is that office second only to
a Presidency, and comes often to be the
Jatter*s -superior in practical force. Those
wise ones who designed the Government
intended the House of Representatives to
be a republic Through its own groveling
abjections, however, it long ago
sunk to an autocracy with the
Speaker in the role of autocrat.
It sold its birthright for no one knows
what mess of pottage to pass its slav
lsn days beneatb a tyranny ot tne
gavel. The Speaker settles all things.
No measure is proposed, no bill passes,
no member speaks except by the Speak
era will. He : constructs the - commit
tees and. selects their chairmen and;
lays out their work. With a dozen mem- !
bers, every one of whom votes and acts
beneath his thumb, the Speaker trans
acts the- story of Â£he House. So far
as the' other three hundred and forty,
odd members are concerned, the folk
who sent them might as well , have
written a letter. They live as much
without art or part or lot in planning
and executing House affairs as' do {the
caged menagerie animals in; the, plan
ning and execution of the. affairs . of
what show they happen to exist aa the
attractions. These caged ones of the
House are never regarded and but Bel
dom heard. The best that one of them
may gain is "L-oave to print," which is
a kind of consent to be fraudulent, and
permits a member to pretend through
the Congressional Record that he made
a speech (which he never, made) and
was overwhelmed by applause (which
he did hot receive) which swept 'down
in thunderous peals (during moments
utterly silent) from crowded galleries
(as empty as a church).. -
Senator Hanway, when he decided to
pick out a House Speaker favorable to
his hopes, had plenty of -time wherein
to lay his plans. â¢ The personnel. -of ; a
coming^ House Is 'known for over a*
year;-, tne members are elected nearly
thirteen- months before they take their
seats.! These thlrteen'months of grace
are granted the new. member . by the
constitution jj on a "hopeful theory that
he will devote thera'to a study of his
country's needs.; In this instance, as
in many another, '\u25a0 theory and practice
wander wide apart:- the new, member'
gives those thirteen months to; a pro
found study, of his own needs, and con
cerns himself no more over the nation's
than over wine-pressing in | far-away
Bordeaux. It Is the glaring fault of
every scheme of government, your own;
being- no exception to the rule, that" it
seems meant for man as he should be
rather than for man as he Is.. '.'
Every member of, the coming House,
â¢among matters of personal moment -to
himself, had given no lltle thought to
what comittees he would be placed up
on; and this, in the nature of House
things, likewise compelled him to .a.
consideration of the Speakership and,
who should fill It. It was by remem-"
berlng ftiose committee hopes' and fears :
of members, and adroitly fomenting;
them, that Senator Hanway expected. to:
control the Speakership election. ..'.,
But he must go warily to work.
Coming from the- Senate end of the.
Capitol, Senator Hanway,; in * his pro
posed interference In the organization
of the House, must maintain himself
discreetly in the dark. Jt was hot a
task to accomplish blowing a bugle.
The House had surrendered Its .powers
to. the Speaker;. but it had, retained Its
vanity, . and' like* all 'weak, animals' it
was the more. vain for being weak/The'

Fresldency; and tills not. only offered*
a perfect reason 1 why_ Senator_ Hanway

it multiplied the necessity ;for~his. de.-. .

That member upon whom Senator..
Hanway settled for Speaker owned the
biting name of Frost; it was an- inâ
stance, however, when -there was noth
ing In a name.' Mr. Frost 1 was a round,'
genial personage and only biting with,
occasional sarcasms; then, it : is true,'
his sentences cut like a rawhide.. He :
was big, breezy, careless,- quick, and
coming of an aquatic ancestry, oceanic
in his' sort; even his walk reminded
one of a grouna swell. And yet he was
defective as. a candidate. The House
members liked, him well, despite" those
verbal. acridities which shaved the sur
face of debate as lawns are shaven by
a scythe; but with the last word there
existed no recognized House or party
reason, whether of the past, the pres
ent or the future, why he should bo
made Speaker. In the lay of 'House
topography he was on the wrong side
of the river from the Speakershlp.Vand;
to land him within stretch of the gavel V
required that Senator Hanway either
ferry or pontoon him across. This the
latter gentleman set himself to accom
plish by, a series of intrigues and;strat
agems that would have brightened the'
fame of a Talleyrand.
The statesman opposed to Mr. Frost
for the Speakership was a personage
named Hawke. He stood possessed of
honesty. Intelligence and energy; also
he had been for long the leader of his
party In the House, and ; given . his
name to ' a tariff measure. "With- \u25a0
out one -gleam of humor, he- was.
of a temper hot as that of any,.

many reasons for being admired and
none for befns* loved. ."\u25a0\u25a0'. -
This should be a key to the man.
He had been a brave soldier during
the Civil War, and when his men. most

and these men. arming "themselvesâ
complained that their weapons were
no match for the Enfiolds of tne foe, re

"General," said the spokesman* of ttie
soldiers, "these yere shotguns; ain't no

"They are a match for them.", retort- â¢

Months before ever. Senator Hanway

proposed,, waxed, threateningly, exuber

clferate ;and slap members upon ' their
backs and jovially arrange committee

Harley, whose methods- were soineiwhat
coarse ; and who. did most .things ! with
an ax, was precisely of * that hopeful
sort who .would ndverttee an auction of
the lion*; hide awhile Lit : was yet upon
the beast. :â¢: Senator,. Hanway. 7 with 'in
stincts safer fand more ; upon' the i order
of the mole's,, forbade /such campaigns
'ni noise. . - ' v ~. ~ >; .
"You must keep silent.V John," said
he, "nnd never-let men know, what we
are about. You are inclined, apparent
ly, to regard, a Speakership as .[you
might a swarm of bees; you think one
has only tobeat a tin pan long enough
or blow a tin horn; loud enough In or
der to hive It according to one's wish.
The Speakership,. however, so. far from
being a swarm .of bees is more like a
flock of blackbird?, and the system to
;which you- incline ; would -. prove the
readiest means -of- frightening away
our every chance. In short, .you must
work by my orders and^meet no one,
say nothing, except as I direct.", . ; ,
Then Senator Hanway. sent Mr. Har
ley. much modified of his 'vigor, with
a secret invitation to. Mr. J Frost! When
that personage was -brought to 'the pri
vacy of the. Harley' house, he laid open
to his ;ambitlon\-those gavel prospects
\yh}ch he, denator> Hanway, had al
ready constructed , In his thoughts. .
â¢ There was no conflict of argument
wUli Mr. Frost;. he rose to' the sugges
tioh>llke a bass to a fly. Knowing him
jielf to be of. a genius too -openly bluff
find frank, and no one to conquer those
elements which his. campaign would re
quire, he put .^himself In the hollow of
Senator -.â¢. â¢ Hanway's \u25a0'hstnd-. to 'X be 'con

voluntary prompt submission the
part of Mr.' Frost: had a further sub

.tation .thereof he, too, began to speak
in whispers ans step r; with care, and ask
his eminent- relative for -orders in all
he- went -about. â¢ :
\u0084 Now when; Senator- Hanway had
trained, his partner and his candidate
to come to heel he began to unravel his
diplomacy. .By 'his .-suggestion, Mr.

j .Senator Hanway's anxious wits were

own State delegation in â¢ the House?by;
sheer stress of .that machine which he
\u25a0had; upreared-^for his own defense at

."Tharik.you, sir. Very, good," slr!"^ said
Mr. Gwynn., . i ,"'..\ \" -
Mr. Gwynn . received jj Senator' Hanway
in his library; Richard was present, con
sidering the world at large from a' win
dow. \
"And first of all." said Mr. Gwynn,
after greeting Senator Hanway, "and
first of all, let me Introduce to your
notice Mr. Storm 3 ." I may say to you,
sir, I have, confidence- In Mr.; Storms;' I
act "much by his advice." And here Mr.
Gwynn looked at: Richard as though ap
pealing for corroboration. . :
Senator ... Hanway, from whose nimble
faculties; nothing escaped, noted this ap
peal: He thought the less of it. since Mr.
Harley had given him .some glint- of the
measureless mllllonss of Mr. Gwynn, and
he deduced " from this "stiff turning', to
ward' Richards, this brittle deference,
nothing save a theory j that Mr. \ Gwynn,
by virtue of his tremendous riches, haa
grown too great to do his own listening
and thinking. It was as plain, as it was
proper, that he # should hire them done,
precisely, as he' hired a groom S for his
clothes. Senator Hanley," himself,' was at
bottom impressed by nothing so much as.
money, and was quite prepared to believe
thnt one of the .world's ' wealthiest' men
- â for such he xmtlerstood to be the. case
of Mr. Gwynnâ would ; prove In* word
and deed; nnd thought a being wholly
different , from one about him.
Wherefore.'- his heaped millions ac
counted In' Mr. : Gwynn for what other
wise might have,. been considered by
Senator Hanway as queernesses.
, To add to this. 1 Mr. Gwynn was of a
certain \u25a0 select -circle of English exclu
sives;.- Senator Hanway had learned
that .much from his sister, Mrs. Han
way-Hurley.. It was to be expected
then- that he would have some one
about him to furnish brains for his de
liberations, and to make up his mind
as a laundress makes up shirts. . Sena
tor Hanway, knowing these things of
Mr. Gwynn;' was In no wise surprised
that heispossessed In his -service one
who ' wasi^hearer, \ talker and decider,,
"just ns ancient- kings kept folk about
business, was to make witty re
itorts.for them and conduct sparkling
conversations In ; ; their /stead, '-* they,
themselves, being. too royal' for anything
so; much beneath that level of.exalted
inanity, which as all men know is the
only proper mark of. princely minds.
Something of. : this 'raced hit or miss
through Senator Han way's thoughts, as
Mr.' Gwynn presented Richard and then
relap'sedT-hinge by; hinge as .though
his joints were rusty with much aris
tocratic unbending â into 'a' chair: '
' 'Richard gave him no space to; dwell
upon j the phenomenon. â¢ He' came for
ward .with' a little atmosphere of def
ference; for Richard had his own deep
designs. Then, too, \u25a0'-;. Senator 'Hanway
was white of hair and twice his'age, to
say nothing of being ascertain /young
lady's uncle. V â¢ - . '
\u25a0 "Mr. Gwynn has told me of you," said
he. Then -pushing straight for- the
point after methods of his own, he con
tinued: "What is it the -Anaconda Air
line can do? -Mr. Gwynn", is quite con
vinced, from what -he has been told of
those positions you have from time to
time asumed In the -: Senate, '.' "that :hls
own interest with that of every, rail
way . owner lies* ln&followlng your
leadership. . Indeed, I think he hais de
cided to adopt; whatever suggestion you
may make.'' Richard glanced to%vard
Mr. Gwynn, and 'that great man gave
his mandarin bow. - >
-"\u25a0./' Senator Hanway, .while smitten : of
vague amazement at; Mr. : Gwynn* s ac
quiescent spirit,; accepted it. without
pause. - However marvelous it might
be, at least -he himself ran no risk.
More than that, on second thought it
did : not : occur Jto him as so \ peculiarly
unusual; ; a 'Senator in a measure ' be
comes inured -to the wondrous.
Senator Hanway did not reply direct
ly to ,v Richard's r -query. Direct replies
were not the, habit at \this '.practiced
one. He made a f speech .full of flat
tering -generalities, rHe spoke of
Richard's connection . with \u25a0 the Daily
TorY, and expanded : - upon .the
weight and influence of that jour
nal. : Also, with; a. ' beaming- albeit
delicate f patronage , which Richard ' stom
ached for reasons of his ; own," . he ' inti
mated complimentary things : of : Richard
himself . and . seemed to congratulate > the
Dally Tory |on the ' services \u25a0 of one '\u25a0\u25a0 so
keen, '. so jj sure, so graphic ; ..which , last
was the more kind; ; since Senator 'Han
way could have known no single reason
for assuming >nytKing of the sort. He
told Richard that he hoped to \u25a0 see him
personally \u25a0 every day. Here . Richard
broke in;oh .thelfienatorlaltflow -to ask
ii . he .might wait upon Senator Hanway
every ": morning at 1 - eleven. .: '*\u25a0*
â¢"For I am' warned by,; Mr.: Gwynn," .ex

hand, Mr. Hawke was an enemy to pool-
Ing bills - and , railways. \u25a0 Mr. Gwynn's . in
terest was plainly with, Mr. Frost.
"Not that -I\ care ; personally for the.
success i/of Mr. Frost," remarked Sena
tor Hanway, "but I know tow the rail
ways desire . that pooling bill, and how
that..- pooling, bill is a darling measure
with ' Mr. Frost.".
â¢ "Whjch brings us back," observed Rich
ird, who never took his eyes oft a ques
tion, once put, until he saw It mated with
in answer, "to Mr.- Gwynn's . first inter
rogatory: What can the Anaconda Air

Senator Hanway explained. The Ana

weight of . its Influence upon. those twen
.y-three members. The Anaconda influ
ence might better be exerted through' its
president and general attorney, and per
laps what ..special attorneys were, local

twenty-three.-. , \u25a0 \u25a0' â¢
VMr,; Gwynn," observed Richard, "an
ticipated something; of the kind, and I
think is. prepared to request those officers
trdu.'name to come' to Washington.? ;
"They shall be requested, sir; certainly,

'Certainly, 5 sir; they' shall be requested,"
repeated the, cavernous Mr. Gwynn.

Senator Hanway. â¢ "And you will have

Senator Hanway. .being of a -quick in
telligence, had by this time found his
rightful line. He divided . himself fairly;
for he gave his entire, conversation to
Richards while he . conferred upon Mr.
CSwynn his whole, respect. In good truth,
the less Mr. Gwynn said and the less
he . seemed to hear and understand, the
nore Senator Hanway did him honor in
liis heart, ; The rigid witlessness of Mr.

md sign of an indubitable nobility, and
it was with a feeling treading upon rcv

ator Hanway arose to go. . . . Â« â¢
"I am muc"h refreshed by this inter
dew," said he, taking Mr. Gwynn's
riand and shaking it pump-handlewise.
"Your help should insure Mr. Frost's
luccess. With Mr. Frost Speaker, rail
way interests will be safeguarded. And,"
:ontinued Senator Hanway, quoting from
?ne of his Senate speeches, lifting his
roice the while, and falling into a fine
jeclamatory pose, "he who safeguards
he railroads safeguards his country. Pa
triotism-cannot count the debt the nation

CHAPTER V.
tfoW Richard Wan Taught Many
- Â» . Thlnss.
Richard went every day at eleven for
a brief _confern2e with Senator Hanway.
The latter was no < wise backward in> his
use .of the columns of the . Daily Tory.
There are so many things concerning both
men and measures that statesmen want
said, and which, because of their modes
ty,. they themselves hesitate to say, that
-Senator Hanway, when- now through
Richard he might tell thls-etory of poli
tics or declare that proposal of state, and
still keep his own name under cover, dis
covered in the Daily Tory a source of
relief. So, much, in truth, did Senator
Hanway, by. way of Richard and the
Dally Tory. 'contribute to the gayety of
the times, that the editor-in-chief was
duly scandalized. He aroused - himself
on the third evening, killed Richard's dis
patch and rebuked that earnest Journal
ist with the following:
"Send news; nothing but news. No one
wants your notion, of the motives of
Representatives In fight over Speaker
, ship."
." This led to a word or two between Rich
ard and Mr. G wynn;- the upcome being a
wire f rum ' Mr. uwynn to the editor de
siring him on all occasions and without
alteration or additlonto print Richard's
dispatches. The editor In retort remind
ed Mr. Gwynn that the Daily Tory had ,a
reputation and a policy; also there were
laws of libel. Mr. Gwynn declined to bÂ«
moved by these high considerations, and
reiterated his first. command. After that
\u25a0 Richards in each issue gave way to an

; This dally letter, signed "R. S."
brought Richard mighty comfort; he read

other. authors, found, no literature so good
to his : palate . as his own; and while his
stories looked well- enough when he wrote
them,"- the typ^s never failed In uncover

Being his first work, and performed un
der his own tolerant mastery, with none
to molest \u25a0 film or. make -him editorially
afraid, it stood V scant wonder that Ihe

It ss : self-congratulations." What Richard
neededâ and never, knew itâ was dismissal

paths. Undtr* the -circumstances, how-"
ever, . this Improving â¢ experience 'was ! im
possible: missing .the benefits thereot,
Richard : must .struggle on as best he
might without a bridle.
\u25a0 It was fortunate, when one remembers
his -f blinded i ignorance, a condition : ag
gravated, by. | his â¢ own acute; approval of
himself, -that' Richard had ;a ;no; more^
radical guide than was the cautious Sen-"
ator : Han way;. 1 /While that designing ' gen- \

Invite the i paper ; into ; foolish ..;. extrava
gancies, whether of statement or of style.
As the bug under tha chip the Daily-
Tory's Washington correspondence. Sen
ator 4 Hanway was neither a vindictive nor
yet a reckTess bug; and the paper, while
it became the organ oÂ£ his ambitions,
made some reputational profit by the
very melody of those guarded tunes be
ground. S
Richard, you are not to suppose, went
unaware of those employments to which
Senator Hanway put him in the vine
yard of his policies. He realized the sit
uation and walked therein with wide and
willing eyes. It served his tender pur
pose; it. would take him to the. Harley
house and throw him. perTcnance. Into
the society of Dorothy without the dul
cet "privilege being Identified as the true
purpose of hl3 call.
"One cannot but marvel that Richard
should be at the trouble of so much dif
ficult chicane. It is strange that he
should so entangle what might have been
the simplest of love stories; for you may
as well know here as further on that,
had Richard laid bare the truth of him
self, Mrs. Hanway-Harley, far from
fencing her daughter against him and
his addresses, would have taken the door
off its hinges to let him in. But Richard,
as was heretofore suggested, had been
most ignorantly brought up, or rather had
been granted no bringing up at all. More
over, in the sensitive cynicism of his na
ture, which made a laugh Its armor and
was harsh for fear of being hurt, our
Democrltus had long ago bound himself
with vows that he would accept nofriend
shlp, win no love, that did not come to
him upon his mere and unsupported mer
its as a man. In his own fashion, so far
from being the philosopher he thought,
Richard was a knight errantâ one as mad
and as romantic as the most feather
headed Amadis that ever came out of
Gaul, and so he is to make himself a
deal of trouble and have himself much
laughed at before ever he succeeds in
slipping through the fingers of this his
tory to seek obscurity with Dorothy by
his side. For all that, it is Richard's
due to say that his "R. S." letters at
tracted polite as well as political atten
tion, and got â¢ him much respected and
condemned. Also they lodged him
high .in the esteem of Senator Han
way, who discovered dally new-excel
lencies in him: and this came somewhat
to the rescue of- Richard One day.
Senator Hanway had a room In a wing
of the Harley house which Mrs. Han
way-Harley called his study. It was a
sumptuous apartment, furnished , in ma
hogany and, leather. Â»nd a bookcase,
filled with Congressional Records which
nobody ever looked at, stood against the
wall. Here It was that Senator Hanway
held his conferences: it' was here he laid
his plans and brooded them. When Sen
ator Hanwav desired to meet a gentle
man and preferred to keep" the meeting
dark, j this study was the scene of that
secrecy. In such event, the blinds were
drawn to baffle what prying or casual
eye might come marching up the street;
for in Washington, to see two men con
versing Is to know nine times in ten
precisely what the conversation Is about.
Commonly, however, the bllnd3 were
thrown wide, as though the study's pure
proprietor courted a world's scrutiny.
It was in this study that Richard was
receive* by Senator Hanway. There was
an" outside door; a caller might be ad
mitted from the veranda without
troubling the main portals of the Har
ley house. To save the patience of that
Journalist. Senator Hanway called Rich
ard's attention to the veranda door and
commissioned him to make use of it.
Senator Hanway said that he 'did not
â¢ wish* -to "subject "one 'whom he valued
?&e)^m'jrhly, and who was on. such near
terms with his good friend. Mr, Gwynn.
to the slow ceremony whicn attended a
regular invasion of ; the premises, r , x
I Richard thanked Senator Hanway. al
though he could have liked it 'better had
he been less thoughtfully polite. Richard
would have preferred the main, door, with
whatever delay and formal clatter such
entrance made imperative. The more
delay and the more clatter, the more
chance of seeing Dorothy. It struck him
with a dubious chill when Senator Han
way suddenly distinguished him with the>
fredeom of that veranda doorâ a fran
chise upon which your statesman laid
flattering emphasis, saying that not ten
others^had been granted it
This episode of the veranda door befell
upon the earliest visit which Richard
made in his quality of correspondent of
theiDally Tory- On that day. being ad
mitted by way of the Harley front door,
Richard had the felicity of coming In
with the before mentioned dally sheaf of
roses. Richard and the blossom-bearing
colored youth entered together, the door
making the one opening to admit both;
nnd by this fortunate chance â which
Richard the wily had waited around the
corner to secureâ he was given the Joy
of seeing and hearing, the beautiful
Dorothy gurgle over the flowers.
"And to think," cried Dorothy, her
nose In the bosom of a rose, "no
one knows from whom they come!
Mamma thinks Count Btorrt sends them.
It's so good of him. If he does!" â¢
Dorothy's head was bowed over the
flowers. As she spoke, however, her blue
eye, full of mischief, watched Richard
through a silken lock of hair that had
fallen forward.
"But you don't think it's Storrl?" cried
Richard dolorously.
"Oh, no!" returned Dorothy, shaking
her head with wise decision. VI don't
think it's Count Storri. But of course
I wouldn't tell mamma so; she doesn't
like to be contradicted. Still," and here
Dorothy looked quite wistful, "I wish
I knew who did send them.;*
Before Richard could take uÂ» the de
licate question of - the . roses and their
origin, there arrived the word of Sen
ator Hanway that he be shown into the
study.
"Now that I'm a working Journalist,
Miss Harley," said Richard. "I shall be
obliged to see your, uncle every dÂ«r."
"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Dorothy, with
a fine sympathy; "how hard t!Â»v fcrive
you poor newspaper peoplel"
"Still, we go not without our re
wards," returned Richard.
Then observing that Senator Hanway*s
messengerâ who had not those reasons
for loitering which made slow the feet or
Richardâ was already halfway down the
hall. Richard took Dorothy's small hand
in his, and - before she knew her peril
or might make an effort to avoid It,
rapturously kissed the Sneers, not once,
not twice, but five times. The very fin
gers themselves burned with the scandal
of it! Following this deed of rapine.
Richard went his vandal way: Dorothy's
face turned a twin red with the roses.
Dorothy said : nothing in rebuke of
Richard, and It is. to be assumed that so
flagrant an outrage left her *rtÂ«Â£out
breath to voice* her condemnation. That
she was disturbed, to the heart is sure,
for she' went .instantly to her friend, the
sibyl of the golden locks, for conference,
confidence and- consolation.
"Wasn't he " wretchedly bold. Bessr
said Dorothy In an awe-stricken whisper.
"Absolutely 5 abandoned!" said Bess.
/Then the two sat in silence for ten Im
pressive seconds.
Continued Next Sunday.THE rhcciiir.s doing to death cf
Catherine de Paoli to satisfy a su
perstition is a circumstance that
is more than merely interesting.
It is something" more than, a sen
sational crime to read over your morn
ing coffee, shudder ul and fastidiously
.ii^miss from your mind.
In cur interdependent, complex, cosmo
-<j!i:an city life there is a responsibility
*f the enlightened and fortunate to the
inenlightened and unfortunate that is
*c!y , partly recognized and as often
evaded, and a shocking crime iike this
:â¢: veals it with the suddenness and vlvid
::â¢ ss of a flashlight.
I winder, iis I write the word. 5f it Is
altogether just to call it a crimeâ appall
i"s as was the deed: for ignorance, after
\u25a0\u25a0>.!!. i* not wickedness.
A man s'.ays a woman- his own broth
er's wifeâ violently, horribly, with un
.-peakabSe fury, because he believes her
;><>s?Â«ss*d of devils and to have bewitched
his little children, to Taave put a spell
upon them, and upon h!s wife and himself
that will cause their death.
For self-preservation, and for what is
;>erhaps dearer than the preservation of
selfâ for the safety of his children â he
?-eats to death the woman possessed of
devils.
It is unbelievable, grotesque; it savors
cf the Middle AgÂ«s and the witch-burn
ing days of our own Cotton Mather.
Yet this is the twentieth century, and
an enlightened world â and the thing hap
><;-ned here, a week ago.
Emerson, in his far-seeing wisdom, cau
tioned us year* ago. before we had ocean
liners* carrying a town's population in
â \u25a0 â¢heir steerage, that we would yet have
:o reckon with the ignorance and unde
ve'opment of immigrants who were "but
one degree above the Quadruped."
One cannot rr.ake so harsh an estimate
of Luigl de Paoli. who beat to death his
sister-in-law because he sincerely be
lieves she was possessed of devils.
He is a man typical cf the Italian im
migrants that swarm to this country, and,
in a generation or two, profiting by our
Institutions, mtke good, useful, intelligent
citizens.
He Is a man who lived the hard, nar
row, groveling life circumscribed by
ignorance and poverty.
Luigi de Paoli, until he committed the
shocking deed that ha,s put him behind
prison bars, his poor, demented wife in
the asylum for the Insane, and his
ivo>rse than orphaned children in the
care of charity, was a flower gardener,
living in a little cottage at 420 Charter
Oak street, providing for his wife and
three children by toiling every hour of
the working day at gardening. 1
He was poor and industrious.
He was sober and frugal.
He was honest, well-meaning and
law-abiding.
Tour property or mine, your life or
mine, were perfectly safe so far as he
J was concerned.
& . He was domestic.
He was religious.
And he was profoundly ignorant and
deeply superstitious.
For people like that life cannot be
very brilliant or diversified.
It is made up of the struggle for
subsistence, the love and care of their
offspring, the hope of salvation '-,; for
their souls.
So it was with the De Paollsâ husband
and wife.
Tho man labored with bent back and
gnarled hands in the soil among- the
prowing thing* as long- as there was
light.
The wife toiled In the little cottage
at the household duties and In the care
lof the children. \u25a0
They went to church and practiced
the observances faithfully so that their
souls might be saved.
They loved their children with a
ncrce. elemental, almost animal love.
They labored, ate, slept, prayed and
dandled their babies, and life was falL
And they believed In the* possession
of devils, in what Is commonly known
as the Evil Eye.
Alonts with thousands of other
Italians In the old country and the new
they believed that if sickness or re
verses came, if the family or the cattle
fell sick. If the crops went wrong, or
C*he house burned down, or trade or
.Ajhing- failed, it was because of the
Evil Eye; it was because some one pos
sessed of devils had put a spell upon
them.
For. a whole week before Luipi de
THE TERROR OF THE EVIL EYE
I'a.oli found it necessary to kill his sis
ter-in-law- to get rid of the devils that
possessed her and worked ill to him
and his, things had been going wrong
in the little cottage on Charter' Oak
street.
So Luis?! de laoli *ays in his state
ment to the police explaining .why he
had to kill his sister-in-law.
A peddler man had e-o:iie along, and,
the family not being q-.iite well, he
had bought some medicine from fcim â
Eotne little white tablets, a::d all the
family had taken them.
The tablets made them feel queer,
and into Lu i si de Puoli's head came
the notion that they were bewitched
tablets, and thuV if any one who liaÂ«l
taken them should/ fall asleep he
would never wake up. .
So throughout the whole week all
the efforts of De Paoli and his wife
â¢were devoted to keeping themselves
and the children awake â even the lit
tle baby in arms â anil to expelling: the
devils from the household.
They went to church atid they prayed
at home; they burned candles to their
patron saint, i^nd they tried various
charms and exorcisms to drive' away
the devils. They slapped and pinched
and shook the children to keep their,
awake; even bathed tbelr faces in vin
egar and- held the little baby's head
under the faucet. Yet. strange to say,
the children sleepier and sleepier,
and their efforts to keep them awake
were futile. They would drop off to
sleep. .
They got afraid to stay in the housy
where the devils wereâ so says Luigi
de Paoli â and on the night of the mur
der (Friday. November Â£4) they went
to his brother's house and asked the
brother and his wife. to go to church
with them and pray with them. This
they did, and after coming from church
the brother's wife. Catherine de Paoli,
â¢went home with them, because they
were afraid to enter their little cot
tage without some one.
There they went on In desperation
with their efforts to keep the sleep
famtsbed little ones awake, and again
they prayed to, exorcise the devils.
They bad their little colored religious
pictures before them, and, so Virginia
. de Paoli. the wife of Luigl. says to 'the.
police in her, statement:
"We were praying to save ourselves.
We were praying our way, and she
(Catherine) was praying her way.**
It was between 2 and 3 o'clock in
the morning, and the sister-in-law,
sharing this strange vigil, protested
against keeping the poor little baby
awake any longer.
In their councils husband and wife
had whispered to each other their sus
picions that Catherine de Paoli was
possessed of the devils tormenting them.
She had , touched the children, espe
cially on this nightâ -and the children
â¢were plainly' sleepier, than ever. Now
she wanted, them to let' the little baby
go to sleep, when they knew that sleep
meant death for any one of : them.
The sister-in-law was standing, by*
the kitchen . stove with her back to
them. They exchanged glances. - The
HELEN DARE
man caught up a chair and fell upon
the sister-in-law. His fury grew with
the onslaught. One carair was broken
and then another, and the dreadful, sick
ening deed was done.
This was at 3 in the morning:.
A little before 8 a neighbor came
to the . little cottage on Charter Oak
street and Luigi de Paoli called to him:
"You cannot come in here. You can
look in through the window and see."
He looked, j
There was a* still, shapeless thing on
the floor. Luigi told him what it was.
There were the religious pictures, .
cheap little colored prints, scattered
about, the rosary on the table;: the
mother, ghastly,* distraught, still strug
gling to keep the little fretting baby
awake.
'"There was nothing else to do. It
was better to kill her than that, we all
should die.** . ; . \u25a0 "-'. **
This is all that Luigi de Paoli says,
with an earnestness beyond description.
' It is" as if he says he and _ his cherished
family were," Journeying; through ' a "wil
derness and wild beasts fell upon them
and he had to kill to save his own;* or
.as if a mad dog. once a pet, had put their
lives In Jeopardy ; and had to be â¢ slain.
In his words and tone, there is Justifica
tlon and there , is \u25a0 sorrow. '
His conviction and his attitude are;uri-
alterable.
With his aftorney, ' Judge Splnetti. - I

century mind, the act Is the act only "of a

He goes over in, Italian (JudgeSplnetti

"What could I do?" he asked at the
end; \ "There was only one thing to do
it was her life or ours; I had to save my

The sincere belief, the absolute convic

He looks from one" to "the "other so

speaking, awful gesture, a sweep of
the hand around the neck and an up
ward jerk dreadfully ; Illustrative-â it
means el cordo, . the rope, for him, and,
well, he Is ready.
Yetâ what else could he do? Surely
he had to save his children.
So absolute Is his belief in the
â¢â¢dial." "
The "dlai" is what 'the Italians call
this : superstition which we commonly
and; Incorrectly term the" Evil Eye. and
"dial" means merely "devils," being
the Italian plural for. devil.
\u25a0The murder of Luigi de Paoli's sis
ter-in-law, by Luigl de Paoli for. this
strange reason would be but a sensa
tional incident if. it were not for the
fact that his superstition Is-fshared by
thousands of his countrymen right here
in San Francisco. . .
'.: Among- YtHe humble Italians there is
perhaps -not a home, where the "dial"
are not * feared, 'where \u25a0 strange precau-,
tions against theni: are not-; taken..
It is a superstition that Boccaccio
made merry with in" his day and hung
many a side-splitting tale upon;, setting
the sophisticated to playing pranks
upon the credulbas. .
;' \u25a0 But 'never â¢ before has tit â¢ been \ carried"
to the fearful extremity that unhappy
Luigi dePaoll's terror drove him to.
; Once' upon- a * time, so _ local history
runs, ; a family in- terror \of . the "diai"
were engaged s in exorcising; them' by
frying a - heart, according to an . old
crone's advice, and keeping an eye on
the door for -the, one. possessed- of,' the
devils, thathad iworkedjthem ;ilir* The
one possessed â¢ would ibe the first' one to
enter, according to^ the! working^ of .the'
charm;^"and- the" 1 first >one to enter,, in
consequence -was ' set \u25a0\u25a0 upon and beaten'
wi th ; the frying pan u ntil he was a can
didate, for six weeks' treatment in a
hospital. . ; .',
This Is but one incident, and for all
but the man who met the frying" pan
a laughable incident. "
More serious was the belief that ery
sipelas was an infliction of the Evil
One.
Among even the. enlightened Italians
it was, .and indeed is. the custom, as
soon as -erysipelas develops in a pa
tient, to cut off the doctor's visits,
"throw the medjclne out of the window
and call in some, old crone with a gift
to mutter incantations to drive the
devils out. |Â§|fÂ§ " '
\u25a0 It is no secret that in the case of
no less a person than the late -Senator
-Palmier! this was done, and that his
death resulted from the treatment
s'lt is not so long ago that. , in - order to
stamp out this very abuse, four old
women," who were supposed to be gifted
with "the fower to drive out devtl3. were
prosecuted in order to force the admis
sion that they were frauds and had no
such power, and thus open the minds of
the duped, ignorant, credulous folk hold
ing to' : their superstition.
v f All- the. H*i tha t v flesh and fluctuating
fortunes are heir' to are attributed to the
machinations of the "dial." If one man's
- horse â¢ runs 'away.; or another man's barn
" burns -down:] If ;the v pigs die or sickness
comes. to the cattle; 'if: the baby frets, or
the wife pines, or melancholy attacks the
husband, the "diai" have been at work,
and some unsuspected person in. the guise
of a" friend has brought their wicked influ
ence'into: the- "household.
"\u25a0-. So prevalent Is the belief that only^ a
little; while ago one, bright little woman,
otherwise .of .-modern' mind; I whose baby
fell- 111 of meningitis, insisted that Â«i girl
of hers had "looked at It strange
i;lyV;and then it fell 'ill. - ' '/\u25a0: .
is not surprising- when the "dial" hold
: terrors -that- strange : things are re
-sorted; to -to* drive "them away and cir
cumvent - them.
Sometimes it is not practicable to fall
upon and beat the devils oat of the pos
sessed one. as Luigi de Paoli did oat of
his j sister-in-law.
A common way is to ward off the evil
influence by pointing two fingers at the
possessed one â the forefinsw and tha lit
tle one. with the two middle fingers
turned under the palm.
As_a permanent charm against the dial
this' same sign Is made by stuffing a
glove, sewing theÂ«flngers back, and hang
ing: it over the doorway to protect the
dwellers within.
Ashes and oil mixed into a paste and
rubbed upon the breast in the form of
the cross is another protection.
For the same reason the beautiful
strings of Neapolitan corals that our fash
ionable girl globe trotters have brought
home to become the fad of a moment aro
worn by the Italians of the south of Italy.
Many are the secret and private
schemes for circumventing the dial,
schemes so* childish that they would bo
laughable were It not for this shocking
circumstance that has shown how grava
a tfcins superstitution may become.
Dr. Badgalupi. the young autopsy sur
geon, made the statement at the cor
oner's inquest that three-fourths or four
fifthsâl forget the proportion, figures
ever eluding â¢me gaccessfullyâ of the "
Italians here believe in thÂ© "dial.** and
many of the educated and cultured mem
bers of the Italian colony Indorsed bis
statement.
\ But the Italian colony, wounded in
pride, is up in arms at the charte. It
does not deny it; it only regards the
statement as a disloyalty, bringing- the _
colony into disrepute.
Yet to cover a sore spot and deny its
existence does not cure it. " It festers
even white it Is hidden.
There are many charging, intelligent.'
educated, cultivated people in the Italian *
colony, and it lies with them not to hide
this blemish of ignorance upon their
countrymen, but to let the light in upon
it through their" own papers, their own
teaching and gentle uplifting.
If Is for them to feel the responsibility
of the enlightened and fortunat* to 'the
unenlightened and unfortunate.SAN FRANCISCO'S TRADE WITH ALASKA
~y XCEPT for rhetorical purposes
j San Francisco does not care for
| f the Alaskan trade," says Dr. Ca
t* bell WHtehtad. president of the
Alaska Bank and Safe Deposit
Company of Nome, and prominently Iden
tified with many Important undertakings
in the Far North.
"Oh, yes, I know that when depart
mental reports come from Washington
with a. deadly parallel of the business
done from this port and the business done
by your Puget Sound rival, there Is some
distress over the showing and you won
der about the reason. But It ends in
wonder, doesn't It, and nothing is done to
change the balance?
"San Francisco is too big to be jealous
of Seattle or any other place, and should
admit that that city has won fairly all the
trade she has secured In Alaska, won
without many of the advantages this port
enjoys. Seattle takes care of that mar
ket, fosters the feeling that no other deal
ers are so well able and co well dis
posed to serve it, and In season and out
of season solicits and seeks to develop
business.
"It Is not . essential to send traveling
men on regular trips through the Terri
tory, though certainly every firm seek
ing to establish an Alaskan connection
should have Information that can be de
pended upon as to conditions and require
ments there. There are prevalent more
misconceptions of the life and conditions
in Nome and along the Yukon than would
seem possible In this day of widely dif
fused news.
"A business invoking millions of dol
larsâand the Alaskan trade has grown
till it deserves to be referred to so re
spectfullyâcannot be successfully handled
without careful study of the buyers. But
it should be a simple matter to get at the
true needs in this case, for the buyers
come to Seattle and to San Francisco,
and may easily be seen. How many,
Nome merchants and business men do
you suppose are in San Francisco to
day?"
I cannot hazard a guess, and Dr. White-*,
head says, "Not less than one hundred,
1 am certain. In Seattle, when we come
through, we are besieged with business.
Dealers want to sÂ«U goods, transportation
companies want to carry freight, and on
all sides are evidences that Seattle es
teems us very highly, indeedâ is devoted
to our Interestsâ considers' our Interests
her own. It is very different here, and
while I personally like the peace, I men
tion the fact merely to prove what I said
in the first placeâ Sac Francisco does not
care for the Alaskan trade.
"Perhaps it Is because San Francisco is
rich, and is satisfied with markets al
ready established- Certainly It Is not be
cause the problems of trade with the
gold country are greater than this city's
business men can master. San Francisco
has done, and It still Is doing, wonders
in a mercantile and commercial way, and
nothing about the business of Alaska la
too difficult, too trying of accomplish
ment. If this city really goes after It.
"The merchants â exporters and com
mission menâ do not have to have some
one come In from the outside and tell
them how to handle any branch of their
affairs. When they determine that the
possibilities In Alaska are worth atten
tion they will do the rest Of course*
my opinion U that these same possibili
ties can hardly be overestimated. I have
been In Nome for five years and have
seen the town grow from an lrregulan
ugly mining camp, a provisioning station.
Into a city offering all the conveniences
to which civilization has accustomed us.
Throughout the Territory development Is
general and thorough. Outside capital is
Interesting Itself there more and more
every year, exploiting new avenues of
wealth, and so to those of us who know
it Alaska has arrived.
"The Pacific slope has no conception of
the future of what Is \*lrtually a separate
empire and what the unfoldment of that
future may mean to every Interest here
represented. Gigantic things are planned
and not alone in the mining of gold are
we to command the world's attention.
"The projected 250 miles of railroad to
connect the fabulously rich copper coun
try of the peninsula with Valdez and the
establishment of great emejters at that
port will make jwsslble an enormous out
put, a production that will shift the cop
per center from Montana to Alaska.
"My opinion and suggestions regarding
San Francisco's trade with Alaska is, of
course, from the outside, for I am Inter
ested only because I want to see the new
country best served. There Is a world of
business to be done there In- almost every
line, and when San Francisco merchants
are in any degree concerned with it. they
will enter the race. So far they have
beenâ^ith one or two exceptionsâcon
sistently Indifferent."
We are taught that to be content with
our achievements, cither as individuals
or communities, evidences the arrest of
progress and to it Is a serious charge Dr.
Whltehcad brings against us.
I becin to cast about for comfort. I
want the opinion of some one of our
selves who, experienced in the Alaskan
trade, knows Its problems from our point
of view and who will have a word of en
couragement to offer.
I vrr.nl to hear some one say that
though our enterprise has not been as
vigorous as It might, yet we are making
an increasingly better showing with flat
tering outlook for the future.
And In this mood I seek out Captain
'?#orsre Baldwin, successful manager of
the Alaskan interests of the Pacific
Hardware and Steel Company.

"I can't talk about San Francisco in
the* Alaskan trade without commencing
with Seattle," says Captain Baldwin.
"Not that Seattle came in on that busi
ness first, but that it is up to us to
learn a lesson from the method by
which the Puget Sound dealers have
gained an eminence that should have
been held by ourselves. ,
" The advertising campaign by which
the whole country was assisted to be
lieve that It was possible for Alaskan
gold-seekers to* equip themselves .only
at Seattle has become a part of his
tory, and so effectively was the plan
carried out that most of the prospectors
did outfit at that port, and naturally
placed their subsequent orders for sup
plies and provisions at that place.
"It has made Seattle, and as the same
enthusiasm has characterized their
handling of the regular business, It Is
only fair to say they have earned thir

four months. That means That every- \u25a0

"Time comes near to being the ' all

ask. lnrormation of A. F. Zlpp, agent
for, the company at St. who Is
now in this city.
"We; hove a number of our own boats,"
said Mr. Zlpp; "boats that we own or
charter, and these are kept busy during
the entire open season. They comprise. a
full complement of river steamers _\u25a0 for r
carrying., general freight and passengers,
as well as ocean steamers.
"This year we sent out five full car
goes from the jort of San Francisco, and
would have forwarded even more if we
could have secured transportation. We
do not depend upon our own vessels ex
clusively, but use space in general
freighters whenever we can. So, though
we had only six or seven full cargoes
out of Seattle In our own bottoms, we
Sent a great deal more freight from that
port than from here by. using steamers of
other lines.
"I think' it is safe to say that of the
50,000 tons of freight that went into Alas- .
ka through the port of Nome this season
at least one-third originated in San Fran
cisco. .That is to say, at least one-third
qf the provisions, clothing, hardware and
general supplies came from California in
the first place; though it was not shipped !
direct. Wry -wasn't It?
'.'Well, thÂ»re are no. regular boats mak
ing the trirs, and neither buyers' nor
shippers can say definitely "when goods
cculd be forwarded or when 'they could
arrive if th'sy wait for direct service from
here.. This might be changed by concert
' ed action on the part of -our dealers and
the transportation companies.

i'You see, there are thousands and thou
sands of people in Alaska and the Klon
dike who consider San Francisco a small
ccast r town, hardly important enough to
rank as a rival of Seattle.' Seattle made
a .drive' for their business in the first
place, .offering cheap transportation by
. rail and boat, and once the tide turned in
that direction It was not hard to main
tain it. , . . . .
"Many of Seattle's citizens honestly be
lieve that their city is larger, than ours, ..
and they pass' the^r confidence along.

"We have one or two steamers out
of this port at the opening: Of the sea

eral supplies and if there were other
freight in quantity we would have
regular sailings.
"But it costs to send a .steamer to

tion party, every one agreed. ThÂ«
pastor himself was heard to say
that he had seldom Been so many
of his people together, and -the
jastor-B wife clasped hands that day
witn some parishioners who had never
been In her house before.
'lie village merchants dropped in for
a few moment* at supper time, while
tlierÂ« was a lull In the business of the*
a-y. end even the busy doctor, after
making: m professional call next door
BMtS *?r? r a , cordlal handshake with the
Pastor, leaving in the latter's hand a
receipted bill for all indebtedness. The
tÂ« th * yCS hEd filled at thls - and a*
*? a v. doctor he hurried to
nnd his wife and share the surprise
V* cr * but a tnouehtful sister who
had observed the scene reached her
nrst. and the little pleasure of telling
her was denied him.
Late In the afternoon Miss* Black.
representative of the most wealthy
family In the parish, had swept through
the parlor, pausing long enough to
superintend the hanging of a fine en
graving she had brought.
It was soon after Miss Black's de
parture that a fine seal pocketbook
was first noticed among the gifts
spread out In the study. No one knew
just who put it there. More than one
lingered it curiously, and one or two
surreptitiously opened it, to see If there
was anything inside. And the pastor
smiled a little as he heard it whis
pered frola one to another that the
pocketbook was empty.
It was late before the weary hostess
heard the gate click after the last
guest, and later yet before she could
nnd time to examine the gifts. For
cross, sleepy little ones must be put
to bed and the confusion that reigned
in their home be reduced to some such
order as would permit breakfasting
there to-morrow â oonr â no â it was to
day. She noticed as she passed through
the kitchen that little cooked food re
mained from supper. Not only had a
multitude been fed, but more than one
mother had carried home a few pieces
of cake to' Tommy or Jane, who had
been unable to attend. But there were
uncooked provisions in abundance; the
shed was filled with fuel, and the
stable with hay and grain for the pas
tor's horse, while the study was tilled
with goods of every description â vases,
tidies, splashers, among which the pas
tor was hopelessly groping.
"You will be able to appreciate these
things better chan I, my dear," he said.
\u25a0 Some of them look very pretty, but 1
dou"t know their uses."
Mrs. Tyler sighed as she danced
around. "There's a good deal here I
haven't any use for," she said. "But I
oughtn't to say it, Ezra, for they have
been Â£e:;crous; that new easy chair and
the- bma and picture, not to mention all
the provisions and dear Dr. Holmes' bill
thai has worried me so. Onlyâ there
wasn't any .money at all. was there,
"1 think nut, Martha."^
"You do so need a new overcoat, and I
was hoping it woula come to-day or the
money to buy it."
"Never mind, my dear;"don't let us de
preciate the gifts we have by sighing for
those that failed to come. I can do with
out a coat very w-ill. My old one Is quite
whole."
"But so shabby, Ezra. And I'm sure
sume of the people feel it a discredit to
ihe church for you to wear it."
"Well, Martha." if it's essential to the
welfare of the church for me to have a
new overcoat, the Lord can provide It.
Ar.d in any case the people can't complain
that their pastor carries a shabby pocket
book. Just see this. Martha."
"What good is a pocket-book with noth
ing to put in ttT' grumbled the tired
wife, owning it listlessly. But in a mo
ment her manner changed. For acci
dentally slipping her fingers into one of
the pockets, she felt a paper, and drew
forth a crisp new billâ a twenty-dollar
hi U- â¢"Â«>
For a moment they looked at each other
in delighted surprise. Then the same
question sprang to the lips of both: Who
could have done it? "You don't think it
could have been Maria, do you?" he asked
wistfully.
But Mrs. Tyler settled the question with
a prompt negative. It wasn't likely that
his sister had sent it after nesrlecting
him so many years. It was much more
likely to have been Miss Black or some
<jf their people. "Though I don't know
who there Is in this parish," she said,
"who would do so generous a thing and
keep It secret."
Mr. Tyler had several matters to at
tend to in the city. There were errands
for several parishioners, and he desir
t-d to spend some hours in the public
library, and carry out a long-cherished
plan of visiting one of the city mis
sions. But he obeyed his wife's In
structions and went first to the cloth
iers', coming out in a new stylishly
ir.ade coat, with no sense of the change
cave that he was more comfortable.
He carried the old coat in a bundle,
which he forgot and left in the next
place he entered. The errands finished,
the mission came next, then the library,
lie was nurrying through the winter
Twilight to the station with a vague
fear that he had read too long and
might miss his train, when a hand on
his shoulder stopped him, and he turned
!n wonder, to confront a blue-coated
policeman.
"Excuse me, ESr," eaid the bewildered
minister, "but I really cannot be de
layed. 1 fear I have already missed my
train."
"Well, I reckon you have, my
friend." replied the officer grimly. "But
the city'll be pleased to give you free
entertainment, so don't let that trouble
you. The best thing you can do is to
come along quietly."
"Ztut, really. sic. you arc laboring un
der a misapprehension; you can have

"Can't 1? Well, 1 know a man that

se*.!l your kind before. You do the

before Mr. Tyler could be made to
understand th.it he was under arrest-
Even then he believed he had only been
rrjistaken for another man, and protest
ed over and over that it was all a mis
take and he should lose his tram. Tae
appalling truth was made plain to him
at la.st. It was he, and none other, who
was wanted â the man who had bought
an overcoat of Claus & Clothier that
morning and paid for it with a twenty
doliar billâ charged with passing ''coun
terfeit money. ; >.\u25ba :
Over and over he protested his inno
cence and tried to explain how the bill
came to him. IT* was only greeted with
incredulous srriles and advised to say
J.'thlng until he had time for reflection.
liiis dazed mind grasped only the mere
outlines of the situation. He, Ezra Tyler,
pastor of the Gimfield Congregational
Church, %vas under arrest. He tried to rc
tntmber how the newspaper items read in
such cases, and the first definite thought
that struggled through his brain was of
the publicity that would be given his case.
Me almost smiled a* iie wondered how
his church would take Itâ the church that
had been unable to bear their pastor's
shabby coat. For a moment he thought
of giving an assumed name.- Then his
real Identity would not be learned in time
for publication to-morrow, and before an
other day they would see the mistake and
let him go. John Jones would do as well
as any name. Dr. John Jones would con
vey more dignity. But when a few mo
ments later he was called to give his
name his truth-loving nature rebelled
against the falsehood and in a clear voice
he answered, "Ezra Tyler." going on,
without further questioning, to explain
that he was pastor of the Glmfleld Con
gregational Church. He heard the charge
against him and for the first time began
to realize the fact that the billâ that pre
cious twenty-dollar billâ was valueless.
There could be no doubt of it, they told
him. An officer more kind-hearted than
the one who had arrested him explained
It all and assured him there would be no
trouble If he was really innocent and
could prove where he got the bill. /
He had a confused sense of many peo
ple around,, most of them looking miser
able and unfortunate.. One woman, carry-
Ing a baby, .staggered as she tried to
cross the room. She was ill beyond ques
tion. He wondered why they didn't do
something for her. and felt relieved" when
a pleasant-faced matron approached and
coaxed the baby to her arms. How piti
fully the thin little arms contrasted with
the rosy baby at home. In one corner
sat a ragged man of middle age, from
whose stolid . face crime had banished
every trace of better nature. Opposite
him was a well-dressed young fellow, his
face buried in his hands. The minister's
heart throbbed with pain as he looked at
them and wondered how long since the
one was like the other and what depths
of degradation lay between. He wished
he were near enough to lay his hand on
the bowed* curly headâ not much older
than the little heads at home. His own
trouble passed from his mind. What
mattered it so lone: as he was Innocent?
Ana an emotion akin to the divine love
and pity moved him as he grazed on these
feliow prisoners r who perhaps were guilty.
Life must have been so, hard for themâ
temptations so strong and wills so weak.
He found himself after a little con
ducted to a cell with two othersâstrange
ly enough the two on whom his attention
had b*en fixed. The attendantâ Mr. Tyler
had no idea what his exact title mljrht
beâ jocosely remarked that he hoped they

repel all advances, had retired -to the op
posite corner and' resumed. his attitude of
deep dejtfction. The minister watched

a Mrs. Marsh rang the bell for a, maid to

the room. "I wish I could think it was
a mistake," she soliloquized as she tied
on her bonnet., "But it's too much like
him. Nobody but Ezra could get himself
into such a scrape as this. Well, he was
quite right when he declared he had no
head for business,'- and after all I shall
have to acknowledge it."
Mrs. Marsh's quarrel with her only
â¢brother dated from his entering the min

had until that time been entirely sub
missive to her wishes. She had selected
his books, his clothes, -his college, even
his friends.'' But, when it came to choosing
a profession and a wife the young man's
will . asserted itself. He would study the-
olog>% instead of banking, and he would
marry the sirl of his choice. The result
had been utter estrangement and a silence
which no effort on the- brother' 3 part
could break. \u25a0 w.r;-; . .

under ; his breath ; that ; the ' working of a

ing she had attended \o it he had not
troubled his head with details. He wa3
far more interested in . the case of his
young friend, and insisted on calling at
once upon the employers, where he argued
the matter with such persistency that
they finally consented not to prosecute If
the money was refunded.
Mrs. Marsh grumbled not a little,
wrote a check for the amount, and the
much-amused "attorney added his mite
by consenting 1 to give the youn; man
a position *in his office, where he would
be under strict supervision and out of
\u0084 temptation's way.
Altogether, as Mr. Tyler sat at
lunch in his sister's house, he was by
no means unhappy, even though his par
ishioners were yet to be confronted.
If he only knew where that bill came
from! That was a mystery which
must be solved before the world could
be entirely assured of his lnocence.
As the train drew into Gimfleld that
night Mr. Tyler stepped from it with,
the utmost unconcern. It had ceased to
be of any consequence what his par
ishioners'thought. The few-people he
met greeted him. warmly. One or two
stopped to shake hands and express
their regret at his disagreeable experi
ence. He felt his hypocrisy in allow
ing" them to call it an unfortunate mis
take. Hi 3 wife met him at the door,
full -"of .."questions and comments, but
he brushed them all aside, only in
quiring, with a sarcasm she had never
heard In his tone before, if his over
coat was quite satisfactory. Supper
was a silent meal: even the children*
-awed by the general gloom, spoke lit
tle. Tommy was sent away from, the
table for dropping his knife and Lizzie
was sharply reproved for putting her
elbows on the table.
All the time Mrs. Tyler wa3 putting:
the children to bed her husband medi
tated.
Th^ doorbell rang, and Mrs. Tyler,
coming down at that moment, ushered
into the room Miss Black and her lit
tle nephew. Miss Black's face wore an
expression of righteous indignation.
Jimmies eyes were swollen and he hung
behind his aunt. "I have no word 3 to
tell you." she began, "how grieved we
are' at the result of Jimmies naugntl
ness.. It was he who put that counter
feit bill in the pocket-book â Just be- '

"We are very much annoyed," com
menced Miss Black, but her pastor, his

a nice little boy, and I am glad you did
it. That is"â for Miss Black looked scan

Mrs. Tyler never heard.TH E FUTURE OF J UDAISM
IN AMERICA
OY THE REV. MEXDOLA DE SOLA.
THE 2ioth anniversary of the
settlement of Hebrews in the
United States suggests many a
train of thought, but there is
probably none whose pursuit
â¢would be more appropriate than
that which concerns itself with the fu
ture of the religion of the Hebrews.
The early Hebrew settlors w^re imbued
with great uiety. They did not treat Ju
daism as the empty phrsse designed to
pive an air of respectability to their lives.
They knew that it is a positive rollgrion
Imposing well dsiinod obligations and du
ties, and they honored these obligation?
and dtitios accordingly.
In the 25J years now drawing to a close
the Hebrew population of the United
States has increased by leaps and bounds:
and to-day it is probably only exceeded
by that of Russia and Austria. Its mate
rial prosperity has kept pace with its
growth, and it has become a highly im
portant rJement in the general population.
But white the Hebrew is too sensible
and too practical to def pise material pros
perity, he does not make its attainment
the chief aim of his existence. He kn3ws
full well that wealth is a blessing when
justly acquired and properly employed.
BuÂ» he also recognizes that without Ju
daism there can be no Hebrews. He real
izes that the Almighty has preserved the
Hebrew poople through centuries of un
paralleled persecution that they misht be
livin? evidence of the divine authority of
the Mosaic law, and that by their dutiful
observance of that law they should ex
emplify its perfection. The Hebrew
therefore regards the perpetuation of Ju
daism as his iirst and most sacred duty;
and as the ceremonial institutions of Ju
daism have manifestly been the means
employed by Providence In preserving the
identity of the Hebrew people and in per
potuating their faith, he honors these cer
emonial institutions not only because of
their divine origin but because they alone
render possible the performance of Is
rael's mission as a kingdom of priests
and a holy naiion.
The growth of the Hebrew reform move
ment in the United States is familiar to
all who have followed th*- religious events
of the last half century. Its effect is now
manifest in the existence of a generation
of Hebrews who are practically ignorant
of Judaism. Beginning with the repudia
tion of those ceremonial institutions
which have enabled the Hebrews to
weather the storms of ages, and assum
ing the right to abrogate divine laws, re
form Judaism has now assailed doctrines
held sacred by Hebrew and Christian
alike, such as supernatural revelation and
the divine authority of the Mosaic law.
Its foremost representative asks If we
roust yet be cowed by fear of the thun
ders of Sinai, and declares explicitly that
the Bible Is not binding or authoritative
for the reform Jew.
Fortunately the overwhelming majority
of the Hebrew people have no sympathy
with this destructive radicalism. The
principles of the early Hebrew settlers
are the principles of the masses to-day,
for the altar of true Hebrew teaching has
never lacked faithful priests. In days

sUinds to-day before a momen

therefore, the duty. of all those

THE* SAX FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
ZANGWILL ON THE HEBREWS
A FEW years since Israel Zangwill,
7\ when on a visit to this country,
'/"\. delivered an address to his own
people. A few of the epigrams
which he then coined concerning the char
acteristics of the Hebrews are here of
fered:
The Jews had^no country of their own.
They could not possess the land of their
fathers in reality. So they made a port
able Palestine. They carried it wherever
they went. This was a spiritual country.
It could not be assailed by their oppres
sors.
There have been two conceptions of the
Jew. One that he lends money and want 3
it back again; the other that he deals in
old clothes. The truth is Jews. have been
everywhere. They have been everything
except Pope of Rome, and they have come
near to that. If they dealt in old clothes
it was because papal decrees forbade them
trading in anything else but old clothes
and old iron.
Jews, in a way, were as good as United
States bonds; only United States bonds
may be converted, but when a Jew was
converted he lost his value.
Because Bhylock was rich and Jessica
beautiful, all Jews are rich and' all Jew
esses are beautiful. . I wish It were so.' V,
, A ' good looking Jew .was considered' the
fool \of the family, which' Is consolation
for some of us. ' .'\u25a0 ' .
_ The black plague swept over Europe.
The Jews escaped:by reason of ; their dif
ferent hygienic y laws. \ The Christians
charged him- 'with poisoning the wells and
portance are the. burning questions of ,the
day. .And if _; any \u25a0of the^ orators^ on the

thousands of- Jews, were put to death for
not dying of the plague.
Colonel Roosevelt told me thai the Jews
of his regiment were among: his bravest
soldiers. And when Hobson had to be
*klssed it took a Jewess to do it. \u25a0 t ..
. Jews not only furnished money for Co
lumbus" expedition, but his first lieuten
ant was a Jew. This officer discovered to
bacco, which Is greater than America.
\u25a0 Carlyle said the Jews had no humor, but
Carlyle was a Scotchman.
A beggar stole a spoon from a wealthier
member of his race who had entertained
him. When detected the beggar said:
;'By taking the spoon I broke the eighth
commandment, which says, 'Thou shalt
not steal.' If I had not taken it I wÂ«uld
have broken the tenth, which says: 'Thou
shalt not covet." I saw I had to break
one commandment anyhow, so I thought
I might as well have the spoon."
It has always been the desire of Jewish
! fathers, however rich, to have ' learned
sons-in-law, however poor. I do not find
this custom prevalent to-day.
To illustrate why there are no good
Jews in fiction Mr. Zangwill related the
story of the lion 'and the cub. The ciib
had seen a painting of Samson vanqulsh
* ing a lion, and said to its parent: "I have
'seen many contests' betweeri lions and
men and always the men have been the,
victors. Why are there no pictures show
ing lions overpowering men?" "It is be
cause we lions have no painters," was the
. parent's reply. ' i.
The Jews have been scattered to the
four winds among all tlie nations of the
earth. They have been of immense ser
vice to every country that has harbored
them. "It reminds me of the itory of the
crocodile, which opened its mouth so ; that
a bird might go into it and eat the leeches
which annoyed ltr There was mutual be:ie^
fit from the operation. It is not strange
that sometimes the Jews find the croco
dile's mouth closing upon them. It was
natural tliat Jews should congregate
arourid their synagogues. They became to
some , extent Isolated I . from the ,' people
among whom they dwelt. This isolation
brought . with 4 it ;," suspicion. , and suspicion

. In medieval times the nations of Europe
had* a" conception of the "' Jewish character
compared' to which Shakespeare's Shyldck '
was " a saint. .It was this " that brought
about the compulsory ghetto.
There are two general types of Jews,
' the German 'and; the' Spanish.' The Spanâ
'\u25a0\u25a0 i'shj Jews speak a mixture \u25a0 of . Hebrew and

German-American Jews
f"y ERMAN Hebrews occupy a prom
s'^ Tir.e'nt and conspicuous position in
the city -of New York, and as a
class are highly respected In commercial
and financial circles.
There were only a few hundred ip this
city until about the year IS4S, and from
that time they have emigrated to this
country in large numbers. There are to
day several hundred thousands in this
city. They or their descendants have be
come leaders in every branch of business
and crowd the legal and medical profes
sions as well. They have outnumbered
the Spanish and Portuguese Hebrews, who
were at one time' 30 prominent in commu
nal affairs, by a thousand to one, and by
their ability and industry have become
the leaders in the Hebrew community.
Although nearly, all the large benevolent
Japanese as Flower Lovers
AMERICANS and Europeans may
have a love for flowers, but the
people of Japan show in many
ways that beautiful blossoms fill a much
larger place In their hearts than in those
of any other people. From the members
of the royal family to the poorest beg
gar in the streets the love seems to be
innate. In the palaces of Tokio there are
exquisite vases of every description which
arc dally filled with rare blossoms. But
the peasant In his paper hut is quite as
particular to fill his bamboo vases "with
some blossoms. Should one chance to
stay at a hotel more 'than twenty-four
hours he will .find fresh flowers every
day to replenish" those which greeted him
on his arrival. Even the half-naked
coolie will have a flower of some kind
stuck behind his ear. At every corner
and all along the streets there are nu
merous flower merchants, and it is sel
dom that a Japanese beggar will hesitate
to part with his last coin to purchase a
blossom. Parents choose flower names
for their daughters, and a Japanese lady
always ' adorns her person with the flow
ers which are appropriate" to the season.
No visitor to the land of the cherry
blossom festival has failed to describe
this most important occasion. The open
ing of the season is the blooming of this
flower, and It is a national holiday. Thou

The German Hebrews have, with few

templesâ Emanu-El and Beth-Elâ in Fifth

palatial synagogues. There are besides
less pretentious temples in different parts
of the city. Many of these temples hold
service on Sundays as well as on Satur

AH sorts of games are played, and In the
evening thousands of lanterns are hung

nobility and the diplomatic corps to a
gardent party. It Is also the season for
family picnics, which are looked forward
to throughout the year by the humbler
classes. Only too. soon is the cherry blos
som festival at an end.
The Japanese cherries are not Intended
to be eaten, but their value Is simply In,
the blossom. It Is the most luxuriant
bloom of, all, and of such importance
that before the bursting of the blossoms
the fact is advertised in all the local pa
pers. The cherry tree sometimes grows
as tall as an oak., and during the time of
bloom it Is so laden with flowers that not
a vestige of leaf Is visible. The flowers
have also a singular and delicate per
fume.

tom of making her dress correspond to the
flowers which are in season. At the cher

embroidered with the flower so much In"

covered with effective sprays of the vari
colored azaleas, and this in turn gives
way before the wistaria and chrysanthe

In the arrangement of their flowers the
people of Japan show great artistic ta3te.

IT is now 250 years since the first He
brew, whose name has been pre
served, arrived on American soil.
Ke was Jacob Bar Slmson.
He came to New Amsterdam from
Hollaed on the Pear Tree on July
8. 1C54, followed in the same year
by a band of twenty-three refugees, prob
ably from Brazil, on the St. Catarina.
The first arrivals in New York met an
unfriendly reception, utterly at variance
with the Dutch character. They were a
small band of refugees, probably from
Brazil, and expected to find in New Am
y *terdam a haven of rest after their
weary pilgrimage. They were regarded,
however, with little sympathy.
The settlement of the Hebrews on the
American continent antedates by fully a
century the settlement of Jamestown and
me coming of the Pilgrims and
the Puritans. The world's history is
linked together far closer than a super
fi< ial observer imagines.
Tt is known beyond doubt that there
were at least five Hebrews with Colum

of the professors of Judaism on the Ibe
rian Peninsula was the beginning- of their
history upon the American continent.
Among the earliest and certainly by far
the most,, advanced and intelligent of the.
colonists who came to the aetr world were
fugitives from the Inquisition, who were
chiefly Hebrews.
It is an undoubted fact that the He
brews were among the first white settlers
in large numbers on the American conti
nent. Their first coming within tne limits
< 1' the United Stutt-s was only thirty-four
v*>ars after the arrival of the Pilgrim
Fathers on the shores of New England.
They participated in the war of the rev
elation and gave in proportion to their
numbers more than their quota of officers,
men and moafy to the patriots' cause.
No less than 7000 Hebrews, officers and
men, participated in the Civil War.
In Newport and Philadelphia.
The earliest Hebrew community in the
United States after that in New York
was that at Newport, R. 1., which traces
:;s beginnings to emigrants ' from New
Amsterdam in 1G55, due probably to the
chilling atmosphere of the Dutch town.
More families followed, attracted by the
liberal principles adopted by Roger Wil
liams as the basis of his commonwealth.
About a century later important acces
sions were made of settlers from Spain.

synagogue was dedicated, there being
Then about sixty-iive families, including
merchants of high standing, among oth
ers Aaron Loi>ez, a rich ship owner, and
Jneob Rodriguez Rivera, who introduced
the manufacture of spermaceti into
America. The revolution dispersed the
Hebrew community, which settled In
other sections, the city losing gradually
its commercial prestige. The Touro fam
ily bequeathed a turn sufficient to main
tain the old cemetery and synagogue, the
latter a good illustration of old colonial
architecture, and after long years of si
lence it is again occupied for worship.
Judah Touro Is one of the truly famous
r.ames xn American Hebrew history.
In Pennsylvania the only Hebrew
settlers were of German stock, Lan
caster and Easton being the oldest
, communities, Joseph Simon, Myor Hart
and Aaron Ltvy being pioneers. In
Philadelphia records are kept of two
early settlers, Jonas Aaron (1703) and
Arnold Bamberger (1726 jÂ». The first
assembly for public worship dates from
1747. The Rev. G. M. Seixas. favorably
known for his patriotism, with a num
i Ver of Hebrews who escaped British -
lie in New York, established the first
Portuguese synagogue during the
Revolution. The Philadelphia com
munity rapidly increased In numbers
and influence. Here was established
the first Sunday-school (1S38). in
which Rebecca Gratz, whom Washing
ton Irving suggested a model for Re
becca in "Ivanhoe," was the leading
spirit, and the first short-lived Hebrew
college <I 867). due greatly to the initia

notable were the Hebrews of Charles
ton, a close study of whose history has
just been made by Dr. Elzas of that
city. Their oldest congregation dates
from 1750. The community increased
so rapidly that a new synagogue was
erected in 1794, their strength being
augmented after the Revolution by the
settlement there of many New York
Hebrews. Francis Salvador was a
friend of the patriotic leaders. In later
deca4es the community was to form
one of the largest and most cultured in
the land, and the Hart, De Leon. Moisse,
Lopez.-Lazarus and Cohen families gave
dignity and distinction to the Charles

of Penina Morse (1797-1SS0) the poet,
whose hymns have long been chanted
in the Sunday-schools.
In Maryland, where the "Jew doctor."
Jacob Lumbrozo, was tried in 1658 for
blasphemy, it was many years before full
religious liberty was granted, and not un
til 1824 that two Hebrew officeholders
were elected without being obliged finally
to declare their belief in the Christian
religion. To-day they are prominent in
art. law. science and the university
world, as well as in commerce.
In "Louisiana the Hebrews have pros

What American Hebrews
Have Done.
THE American Hebrew is a fac
tor in American life, and not
an unimportant one. Numeri
cally there are a million and a
half Hebrews in the 'United
< Statesâ about 2 per cent of the
total population, yet it Is a 'question
whether any other single element
in the population has accomplished bo
much toward the development of the
wealth and power of the States as this
one during the 250 years since the He
brews first settled in the land. v
There are some 750,000 Hebrews in New
York now, as many as in all the rest of
the United "Etates.- These constitute 20
per cent of the total population of this
Western metropolis. The contribution of
the Bebrew to the building of the commer
cial and financial supremacy of New York
has been more than proportionate to his
numbers, for the Hebrew has had gen
erations of training in commerce and
finance which well prepares him for city
life In the metropolitan business circles.
A study of the pursuits followed by
the Hebrew is interesting, for it is a
mistake to think that the Hebrew 13

Hebrews
in
Philanthropy
and
Society.
FROM the sociological side the
American Hebrew has had
many problems to solve. The
three separate and distinct
tides and -types of immigra
tion have made It possible to
dispose of these 'problems gradually
and in turn. Those first settling in the
United States were chiefly of Portu
guese stock, and equipped as they were
with .culture and means they took
part in the affairs of the colonies on a
par, with other settlers," reserving only
the ' right to worship God when and
how they pleased.-- *
When the great German influx began
in 1848 ' and 1 thereabout ; different prob
lems'arose. The Americanized He
brews who had been in 'the country for
several generations 'were â¢ not over
pleased . to see the* uncultured, poverty
stricken men. pour into the States, and,
while, they helped them- when in dis
tress,' they -were refused admittance
iritol their family circles. But the Ger
mans were Independent and formed
their own religious and social organiza
tions. They went ".further and began
the great reform religious movement of
which > ohlyi mutterings had been heard
before. ..They; founded!" benevolent or
ders," which established asylums, homes'
and ; hospitals in/; many of " the large '
cltlaa. Each congregation &ad tta
charity branch, generally In thÂ» hands
of the women, and the foundations of
the philanthropic institutions wcr*
broadly laid.
Clubs were formed after the Ger
man model, where men and women as
sembled for social pleasures, and in thÂ«
course of time the German element be
came dominant and more conspicuous
than the Portuguese congregations by
mere force of numbers.
Twenty-five years ago the poor wirÂ»
limited in numbers and well cared for.
The criminal was so exceptional a* to bm
almost negligible. Then came ths perse
cutions in Russia and Roumaala, and
hundreds of thousands of more or less
he'.pless men were driven to America.
Baron de Hirsch, recomlzln? tha imme
diate need, established the Hirsch trust.
which has taken upon Itself tha Btrensth
ening of the weak links in tha philan
thropic chain and the supplying of miss
ing links. By the aid of the trustees of
thta fund the great Educational Alllanca
building was erected in the tenement dis
trict of New York, and as the Jewish
People's Palace it has reached thousands
and hundreds of thousands who miÂ£bt
otherwise have gone astray. Its purpose
has been, in a word, to transform tha
Immigrant Hebrew of all ages and classes
into the intelligent > and patriotic Ameri
can citizen. The hundred thousand dol
lars that In expended by the alliance
every year Is better spent than nine
tenths of the so-called charity given In
alms. It is truly preventive work, pre
venting crime, preventing ignorance and
euff?rins. preventing degradation. ThÂ»
vast building of the alliance is crowded
at all hours until late at n!ght with the
uplifting work, which an elastic system.
has proved most necessary. Thera are
classes to teach English to young and
old; there are clubs of all kinds stimu
lating thought and bringing culture;
there are classes in cooking. In needle
work, in millinery. In art and music, as
wall a 9 in civics and history. It is a hum
ming hive of Intellectualizlng and moral
izing activity from week end to week end.
The example set by the alliance has
been followed In every large city In tbÂ«
United States, . until now this uplifting
machinery Is at work all over the coun
try.
The material welfare of the immigrants
has been looked after no less carefully,
for it was most necessary- Approved
methods of dispensing monetary aid hava
been adopted by uniting the societies of
each community and forming an intimate
connection between the charities of the
different cities. This "has prevented abuses
such as pauperizing and reduplication, and
. ha 3 introduced a system into the work
and eliminated almost altogether the pos
sibility of Imposition.
Helping the immigrants to help them
selves has been the rule followed from thÂ«
beginning. A policy of distributing tha
laborers is followed constantly in the at
tempt to relieve the great Eastern cities
of congestion. Not only are there em
ployment bureaus, but there are labor dis
tribution offices, which send thousands of
workmen to those points where employ
ment i 3 waiting: for them.
Agricultural colonies have been founded
In New Jersey, and many farmers have
bean established on the deserted farms of
New Ensland and In tbe Far West. The
agencies have learned how to select thoso^
adapted to farm life, and the distribution
of these goes on apace. In order to train
the young for farm life the National Farm
School has been founded near Philadel
phia by Dr. Joseph Krauskopf and Its
graduates are sent annually to the State .
agricultural stations and in time will act
as leaders of farm colonies.
The life of the working: girl Is cared for
In such institutions as the Baroness de
Hlrsch Working Girls' Home, where thu
unprotected working girl find 3 not only a
home. . but also many opportunities for
elevating herself and, improving her con
dition.
It was no small task for ths three hun
dred thousand American Hebrews to care
for and lead four times their own number
within the last twenty-flve years, yet that
is precisely: what they have had to do.
.The responsiveness of their charges has
aided materially in the work. The poor
have; helped one another greatly. They
have done so even to the extent of found-
Ing Inns for temporary aid. loan societies
and hospitals.ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN KETTLE

THINK it may be taken as one of
Itho most /remarkable attributes of
Captain Owen Kettle that, whatever
circumstances might betide, he was
always neat and trim in his personal
appearance. Even in most affluent hours
he had never been able to afford an ex
pensive tailor; indeed, it is much to be
doubted if. during all his life, he ever
bought a scrap of raiment anywhere ex
cept at a ready-made establishment, but
in spite of this his clothes were always
ccsispicuously well-fitting, carried the
creases In exactly the right place and
seemed to the critical onlooker to be
ei.pable of improvement in no one point
whatsoever. He looked spruce even in
oiibkins and thigh boots.
Of course, being a sailor, he was handy
with his needle. I have seen him take a
white drill jacket, torn to ribbons in a
rough-and-tumble with mutinous mem
bers of his crew, and fine-draw the rents
so wonderfully that all traces of the dis
aster were completely lost. I believe.
too. he was capable of taking a roll of
material and cutting it out with his
knife upon the deck planks and fabricat
ing gaiments ab initio; and though 1
never actually saw him do this, I did
hoar that the clothes he appeared in at
Valparaiso were so made, and I marveled
at their neatness.
it was just after his disastrous ad
ventwre in Cuba; he trod the streets in
a state of utter pecuniary destitution; his
clicks were sunk and his eyes were hag
gard. But the red torpedo beard was as
t:im as ever; his cap was spick and span:
the white drill clothes with their brass
l.uttons were the usual miracle of per
icction; and even his tiny canvas shoes
had not as much as a smudge upon their
pipe-clay. Indeed, in the first instance
1 think it must have been this ppruceness.
and nothing else, which made him find
favor in the eyes of so fastidious a person
iis Clotilde La Touche.
But be this as it may, it is a fact that
Donna Clotilde just saw the man from
her carriage as he walked along the Pas- '
co de Colon, promptly asked his name
and, setting no immediate reply, dis
patched one of her admirers there and
then to make his acquaintance. The en
voy was instructed to find out who he
was and contrive that Donna Clotilde
should meet the little sailor at dinner in
the cafe of the LÂ»ion dOr that very even
ir.p.
TLe dinner was given in the patio of
ih* cr.fe where palm fronds filtered the
moonbeams and fireflies competed with
the electric lights; and at a moderate
computation the cost of the viands would
have kept Captain Kettle supplied with
his average rations for ten months or a,
year. He was quite aware of this and ap
preciated the entertainment none the
worse in consequence. Even the cham
pagne, highly sweetened to suit the
South American palate, came most pleas
antly to him. He liked champagne ac
cordinp to its lack of dryness, and this
nas the sweetest wine that had ever
passed his lips.
The conversation during that curious
meal ran in phases. With the hors
doeuvres came a course of ordinary civ
ilities; then for a space there rolled out
an autobiographical account of some of
Kettle's exploits, skillfully and painlessly
extracted by Donna Clotilde's naive
questions; and then, with the cognac and
cigarettes a spasm of politics shook the
diners like an ague.
Of a sudden one of the men recollected
himself, looked to this side and that with
a scared face, and rapped the table with
his knuckles.
"Ladies," he said imploringly, "and se
norcs. the heat is great. It may be dan
gerous."
"Pah*" said Donna Clotilde. "we are
talking in English."
"Which other people besides ourselves
understand, even in Valparaiso."
"LÂ«t them listen," said Captain Kettle.
"1 hold the same opinions on politics as
Miss l^a Touche here, since she has ex
plained to me how things really are, and
I don't care who knows that I think the
present Government and the whole sys
tem rotten. I am not in the habit of put
ting my opinions in words, Mr. Silva,
ami being frightened of people hearing
them."
"You." eaid the cautious man drily,
"have little to lose here, captain. Donna
Clotilde has much. I should be very sorry
to read in my morning paper that she
had died from apoplexyâ the arsenical va
rietyâduring the course of the preceding
night."
"Pooh," said Kettle, "they could never
do that."
"Ac a resident in Chile." returned Silva.
"let me venture to disagree with you,
captain. It is a disease to which the op
ponents of President Quijarra are singu
larly addicted whenever they show any
marked pelitical activity. The palm trees
in the patio have a reputation, too, for be
ing phenomenally lons-Â«ared. So, if it
pleases you all, suppose we go out on the
roof? The moon will afford us a fine pros
pectâandâthe air up there is reputed
healthy."
He picked up Donna Clotilde's fan and
mantilla. The other two ladles rose to
their feet; Donna Clotilde, with a slight
frown of reluctance, did the same; and
they all moved off toward the stairway.
Silva laid detaining fingers upon Captain
Kettle's arm.
"Captain." he said, "if I may give you
a friendly hint, slip away now and go to
your quarters."
"I fancy, sir," said Captain Kettle,
"that Miss La Touche has employment
to offer me."
"If she has," retorted Silva. "which I
doubt, it will not be employment you will
care Â«ibout."
"I am what they call here 'on the
beach. 1 " said Kettle, "and \ cannot af
ford to miss chances. I am a married
man, Mr. Silva, with children to think
about"
"Ah I" the Chilean murmured thought
fully. "I wonder if the knows he's mar
ried? Well, captain. If you will go up.
come alonz, and I'm sure 1 wish you
luck."
The flat roof of the cafe of the Lion
dOr is set out as a garden, with orange
trees growing against the parapets, and
eirphants' cars and other tropical foliage
plants stand here and tnwc in round
green tubs. Around It arc the other roofs
of the city, which, with the streets be
tween, look like some white rocky plain
cut up by Bleep canyons. A glow comes
from these depths below, and with it the
blurred hum of people. But nothing ar
ticulate gets up to the Lion d'Or. and In
the very mistiness of* the noise there Is
something indescribably fascinating. '
Moreover, It is a place where the fire-
flies of Valparaiso most \u0084 ^j> congregate.
Saving for the lamps qÂ£ 'leaven, ;they.
have no other lighting on it roof. The
owners (who are Israelites) pride them
selves on this: it. gives the feardenan air
of mystery: it has made it the natural
birthplace of plots above numbering, and
It has brought them profits almost be
yond belief. Your true plotter, when his
ecstacy comes upon him, is not the man
to be niesrardly with the purse. He is
alive and glowing then; he may very pos
sibly be dead to-morrow, and In . \u25a0 the
meanwhile - money Is useless and the
things money can buyâ and the very best
of their sortâ are most desirable.
One more whispered hint did Mr. Silva
give to Captain Kettle as they made their
way together up the white stone steps.
"Do you know who and what our host
ess is?", he asked.
"A very nice young lady," replied the
mariner promptly, "with a line taste in
supper?."
"She is all that," said Silva; "but she
also happens to be the . richest woman in
Chile. Her father owned mines innumer-'i
able, and when he came by his end in our
last revolution, he left every dollar he
had at Donna Clotilde's entire disposal.
By some unfortunate oversight personal
fear has been left out of her composition
and she seems anxious to add it to the list
of her acquirements."
Captain Kettle puckered his brows. I
don't seem to understand you,'.' he said.
"I say this," Silva murmured, "because
there seems no other way to explain the
keenness with which she hunts after per-,
sonal danger. At present she is Intrigu
ing against President Quljarra's govern
ment. Well, we all know that Quijarra
is a brigand. Just as : his predecessor was
before him. . The . man who succeeds him
in the Presidency of Chile will be a bri
gand also. It Is. the custom of my coun
try. But Interfering with brigandage is a
ticklish operation, and Quijarra" is always
scrupulous to wring the neck of any ; one
whom he thinks at all likely to interfere
with his peculiar methods." " ; 'â¢\u25a0 '.-.
' "I should say that from his point of
view," said Kettle, "he -was acting quite
rightly, sir." , . ;
"I thought you'd look at it sensibly,"
said Silva. "Well, captain," here we are at
the top of the stair. Don't you think you
had better change your mind and slip
away now and go back to. your quar
ters?" \u25a0 â¢ : \u25a0-:,. "â¢\u25a0': ;:,' - \u25a0â¢; ;\< ",;
"Why. no. sir," . said Captain Kettle.
"From what you tell me it seems possible
that Miss La Touche may. shortly, be see-
Ing trouble, and It would give me pleasure
to be near and "ready to bear a hand.* She
is a lady for whom I have got consider
able regard. That^supper,; sir, which we
have just*, eaten i and' the wine -are I things
which will live. in my, memory."; . ,
He stepped out < on the" roof and Don
na Clotilde came' to meet him." She. linked
her fingers ' upon "his arm and led him
apart from the rest..- Atjthe farther angle
of the gardens | they: leaned their; elbows
upon the' parapet; and talked;:, while the
glow from the* street below/ faintly l lit"
their faces and the' fireflies winked behind"
their backs. ' \ \u25a0 ~"( :^ r \u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0''\u25a0'\u25a0

posals of similar service before, but they
came from the wrong sort. I wanted a
man, and I found out that you were that
before you had been at the dinner, table

~ Captain Kettle bowed to the compli
ment. "But," %aid he, "if I. am that, I
have all a man's failings." .:\u25a0 . r '
"I like them better," said the lady,
"than a half-man's virtues. And as a
proof I offer, you command jof my navy."
"Your navy, miss?',' ;
"It haso'et to be formed," said Donna
Clotilde, "and; you must form it. . But,

the existing force will desert; to us, arid
with those we must fight and beat the
rest. Once we : have the" navy .we can

sir; but once or twice, when the wnolo

afterward, when I've got a spell of rest.
I've picked up pen and paper and knocked
off one or two of the perttlest sonnets a
man could wish to see in print. If you
like, sir, I'll read you a couple before you
go back to your whaleboat."
"I thank you, skipper, but not now.
Time is on the move and Donna Clo
tilde is waiting for me. What am I to
tell her?"
"Say. of course, . that her orders axÂ»

"My poor fellow," said Silva, with a
sudden gush of remorse, "you are only
sacrificing yourself uselessly. "What
can you. in a small sailing vessel Ilka
this, do with your rifles against a
splendidly. armed vessel like the Can
.celario?"
"Not much in the shooting line, that's
certain." said Kettle cheerfully. "That
beautiful agent sold us even over the
ammunition. There were kegs put on
board marked 'cartridges,* but when I
came to break one or two so as to
serve out a little ammunition for prac
tice, be hanged if the kegs weren't full
of powder. And It wasn't the stuff for
guns even; it was blasting powder,
same as they use In the mines. Ob. sir
that agent was th^ holiest kind 'V^(
fraud."
Silva wrung his hands. "Captain," he
cried, "you must not go on with this
mad cruise. It would be sheer suicide
for you to find the Cancelario."
"You shall give me news of It again
after I've met her," said Captain Ket
. tie. "For the present* sir, I follow out
Miss La Touehe's orders and earn my
Â£12 a month. But if you're my friend.
Mr. Silva, and want to do me a good
turn you might hint that if things gj
well I could do with a rise to Â£11 a
month when I'm sailing the Canceiario
for her."
The outline of Tampique Bay stood
out clearly in bright moonshine and
the sea down the path of the moon's*
rays showed a canal of silver, cut
through rolling fields of purple. The
green-painted bark was , heading 'into
.the. bay on the port tack, and at. moor
" ings before "the town 'In the 'curve "of
the shore" the grotesque spars \u25a0 of v
modern warship showed in black sil
houette' against the moonbeams. ' A
slate-colored naphtua. launch, was slid
ing out over the swells toward the
. bark.
Captain Kettle came up from below and
watched, the naphtha launch with throb
bing interest. He had hatched a scheme
for capturing the Cancelario. and had
made his preparations: and here was an
Interruption coming which might very
well upset everything most ruinously.
Nor was he alone in his regard. The
bark's topgallant rail was lined with
faces; all her complement were wonder
ing who these folk might be who were so
confidently coming "out to meet them.'
A Jacob's ladder was thrown over thc_
side; the , slate-colored launch swept vpM
and emitted a woman. Captain Kettlar
started, and went down into the waist
to meet her. A minute later he was won
dering whether he dreamed, or whether
he was really walking his quarterdeck la
company, with Donna Clotilde la Touch*.
But meanwhile the bark held steadily,
along her course.
The talk between them was not foÂ»
long, v
"I must beseech you. miss, to go back
from where you came." said Kettle. "You
must. trust me to carry out this business
without your . supervision."
"Is your method very dangerous?" she
asked.
'"I couldn't recommend It to an Insur
ance company," said Kettle thoughtfup^A
"Tell me your scheme." f'-.yfm
Kettle did so in some forty words. !!â¢
was pithy, and Donna Clothllde was cool.
She heard him without change of color.
. "Ah." she said. "I think you will do It."
"You | .will': know one way or another
within ah hour from now, miss. But I
must ask you to take your launch to a
distance. As I tell you. I have made
all my;. own boats so that they won't
swim; but. If your little craft was han
dy, my crew would jump ovVrboard and
risk the sharks, and try to reach her In
spite of all I could do to stop them. They
won't be anxious to fl^ht that Cancelario
when the time comes If there's any way
of wriggling out of it."
. "You are Quite right,' captain: the
launch must go: only, Ido'not. Iciest be
your Rueat here till you-can put me on
the Cancelarto."
Captain Kettle frowned. "What's com-
In jr Is Â«no Job for" a .woman *to be in at,
mJ:Mu"
"You, must leave me to my own opin
ion* about that. You s.ee. we differ upon
whÂ»t a woman should do. Captain. You
â¢ay a woman should not be President of
ft republic; you think, a woman should
not be sharer in a fight I am going to
show you. how a woman can be both."
She leaned her shoulders over the rail
and hailed 'the naphtha launch with a
sharp command. A man in the bows cast
off the line, with which it towed; ; the man
aft put over his tiller and set the "en
gines a-golng; and. like a slim, gray
ghost, i the launch slid quietly away in
the globtri. . ,
"You. see." she said. -"I am bound j t<h \
stay with you now." And she looked ujsJb
him "with a burning glance.
But Kettle replied coldly. "You are my

THE helping- hand is often held
out by the man on the road.
Away from home he is depen
dent upon the good will of oth
ers; he frequently has done for
\u25ba him an act of kindness; he is ever
ready to do for others a deed of friend
ship or charity. Road life trains the
heart to gentleness. The liberality of
the traveling man does not consist
wholly of courting the favor of his
merchant friendsâ he is free with them,
but mainly because It is his nature; it
i.-= for those from whom he never ex
pects any return that he does the most.
X friend of mine once told this story:
"It was on the train traveling into
Lincoln, Neb., many years ago. It was
near midnight. It was, I believe, my
rirst trip on the road. Just in front of
me, in a double seat, sat a poor woman
with three young children. As the
brakeman called 'Lincoln, the next sta
tion! Ten minutes for lunchl' I noticed
the woman feeling In her pockets and
1 xjkir.g all around. She searched on
the seats and on the floor. A compan
ion. Billie Vollins, who sat beside me
leaned over and asked: "Madam, have
you lost something?'
"Half crying, she replied, 'I can't find
my purse â I want to get a cup of cof
fee; it's got my ticket and money in it
and I'm going through to Denver.'
\u25a0 'We'll help you look for it.' said
Silly.
"We searched under the seats and up
and down the aisle, but could not find
the pocket book. The train was draw
ing near Lincoln. The poor woman be
san to cry.
" 'It's all the money I've got, too,'
<he said pitifully. 'I've just lost my
.usband and I'm going out to my sis
ter's In Colorado. She says I can get
work out there. I know I had the
ticket. The man took it at Ottumwa
and gave it back to me. And I had
onougn money to buy me a ticket up
to Central City, where my sister is.
They won't put me off, will they? I
know I had the ticket. If I only get to.
Denx'er I'll be all right. I guess my
sister can send Â«ne money to come up
to her. I've got enough in my basket
for us to eat until she does. I can do
without coffee. They won't put me off,
wi 11 -?'
'The woman couldn't finish the sen
tence.
"One of the boysâ Ferguson was his
name â who sat across the aisle beside a
wealthy looking old man. came over.
â¢Don't you worry a bit, madam,' said he.
'I'ou'll get through all right. I'll see the

owner, miss," he said, ; 'and can do as
you wish. It is not for me now to say that
you are foolish. Do I understand you
still .wish me to carry out my original
"Yes." she said curtly.
"Very well, miss, then we shall be
aboard of that war steamer In less than
fifteen minutes." He bade his second mate
<all aft the crew; but Instead of remain
ing to meet them he took a keen glance
at the bark's canvas, another at her
wake, another at the moored cruiser
ahead, and then, after peering thought
fully at the clouds which Bailed in the sky
he went to the companion-way and dived
below. The crow trooped aft and utood
kit the break of the quarterdeck waiting
for him. And In the meanwhile they
feasted their eyes with many different
thoughts on Donna Clotilda La Touche.
* Presently Captain Kettle returned to
deck, sipgresslve and cheerful, and faced
the men with hands in hlÂ» Jacket pock
rts. Each pocket bulged with something
heavy, and the men, who by this time
had come to understand Captain Kettle's
wajs, began to grow quiet and nerx'ous.
He came to the point without any showy
oratory.
"Now. my lads." said he. "I told you
when you shipped aboard this lavender
box In Callao that she was merely- a
fÂ« v rry to carry you to a fine war. steamer
Tihich was lying elsewhere. Well, there's
AhÂ«* steamer, just off the starboard bow
Jt'nder. Her name's the Cancelario, and
'ff? present she seems to belong to* Presi
dent Quljarra's Government. But Miss La
Touche here (who is both me
and you. just for the present) Intends to
ect uo a government of her own; and.
FROM "TALES OF THE ROAD"
and said: 'Yes. she had a ticket when
she sot on my division. I punched ' it
and handed it back to her. That's all
I've sot to do with the matter.'
" 'But,' spoke up Collins, 'this woman
has just lost her husband and hasn't any
money either. She's going through to
Colorado to get work. Can't you just say
to the next conductor that she had- a
ticket and get him to take care of her
and pass her on to the next division?'
" 'Guess she'll have to get off at Lin
coln,' answered the conductor gruffly:
'our orders are to carry no one without
transportation.' All railroad men have
not yet learned that using horse sense
and being polite means promotion.
"The poor woman began to cry, but my
friend Blllie. said: 'Don't cry. madam,
you shall go through all right. Just stay
right where you are.'
"The conductor started to move on.
'Now, you just hold on a mnlute, sir,'
said Collins. 'When this train stops you
be right hereâ right here. I sayâ and go
with me to the superintendent in the de
pot. If you don't you won't be wearing
those brass buttons much longer. It's
your business, sir, to look after passen
gers in a 2x like this and I'm going to
make It my business to see that you at
tend to yours."
"The conductor was lots bigger than
my friend; but to .-* coward a mouse
stems as big as an elephant and 'brass
buttons' s.iid: *A 1! right, I'll be here; but
it won't do no good.'
"As tho conductor started down the
aisle. Ferguson turned to the woman and
said: 'You shall go through all r.'ght,
madam; how much money did you have?"
â¢ " 'Three dollars and sixty-live cents.'
she answeredâ she knew what she had to
a pennyâ three dollars and sixty-live
cents; and I'll bet she knew where every
nickel of it came from! A cruel old
world this to some people, for a while!
"The train had whistled for Lincoln.
Ferguson took off his hat, dropped in a
dollar, and passed it over to Billie and
me. Then he went down the aisle, saying {
to the boys, 'Poor woman, husband just
died, left three children, going to hunt
work in Colorado, lost her purse with
ticket and all the money she had.' HÂ«
came back with. nearly enough silver in
his hat to break out the crownâ eighteen
dollars! ./Â«"' â¢ J
" 'Will you chip in. Colonel?' said Fer
guson to. the old man who had been his
traveling companion? . '\u25a0]"â¢â¢. -,-j
" 'No.', answered the old skinflint. 'I
think the railroad companies ought to
look after cases of. this kind. Ahem!
Ahem!'
" 'Well,' said Ferguson, snatching
the valise out of his seat â I never
saw a madder fellow â 'We've enough
without yours even if you are worth
more than all of us. You're so stingy
I won't even let my .grip stay near
you.'
"When the train stopped at Lincoln
Blllie and Ferguson took the conductor
to the superintendent's office. They
sent -me to the lunch counter. I got
back first with a cup of coffee for the
mother and a bag for the children:
But pretty soon in bolted Billy and
Ferguson. Billie handed the woman a
as a preliminary, she wants that ship.
We've got to grab It for her."
Captain Kettle broke off, and for a" full
minute there was silence. Then some one
among the men laughed, and a dozen
others joined in.
"That's right," said Kettle. "Cackle
away, you scum. You'd be singing a dif
ferent tune If you knew what was be
neath ycu."
A voice from the gloomâ an educated
voiceâ answered him, "Don't be foolish,
skipper. We're not | going to ram our
heads against a brlcli wall like that. We
set some value on. our lives."
"Do you?" said -Kettle. "Then pray
that thi* breeze doesn't drop (as it seems
likely to do), or you'll lose them. Shall
I tell you what I was up to below Just
now? You remember tiiose kegs of blast-
Ing powder? Well, they'rein the lazaret,
where, some of you stowed them; I but
they're all of them unheaded, and- one of
them carries the end of a fuse. That
fuse is cut to burn just twenty minutes,
and the end's lighted.
"Wait a bit. It's no use going to try
and douse it. There's a pistol fixed to the
lazaret hatch and If 'you try to lift it that
pistol wll! ' shoot Into - the powder, .we'll
all go up together without further pala

Yon can't lower away boats and get clear

them off the skids. I saw to that last

to know there are far too many sharks
about to make a swim healthy exercise."
The men began to rustle and talk. :.~iX<
"Now,! don't spollJ your only chance,"
eald Kettle, "by singing out. If .on the
cruiser - yonder : they think ' there Is any
thing wrong they'll run out a. gun or two

on the train. He needs to forget hta busi

the drummer will try his hand at a mod

'\u25a0\u25a0) A. year" or more ago a party of fou?
commercial travelers were making a trip
from Portland to San Francisco, a ride
of thirty-six j hoursâ two nights and one
day. They occupied the drawing-room.
After breakfast on the day of the journey
one of the boys proposed a game of -lu
cent limit "draw." They all took part.
There is something in the* game of poker
that will keep one's eyes open longer
than will the fear of death, so the four
kept on playing until time for luncheon.
About 1 o'clock the train stoppecrYor half
an hour at a town in Southern Ore

stretch. Instead of going 'into the
dining-room they bought. at the
lunch counter, some sandwiches, hard
boiled eggs, doughnuts and pies and
put, them in their compartment. On the
platform an old man had cider for sale;
they bought some of that. . Several
youngsters sold strawberries and
cherries. The' boys also bought some
of these. In fact, they found enough
for a wholesome, appetizing spread.
The train was delayed longer than
usual. The boys, tired of talking,
came back to their quarters. They
asked- me to have some lunch." with
them. Just as one of the party open
ed a bottle of cider a little, barefoot,
crippled boy. carrying his crutch under
one arm and a basket half full of
strawberries under the other, passed
beneath the window of their drawing
room.
"Strawberries. Nice fresh straw
berries, misters â only a dime. a box,"
called out the boy. 1 "Three for a quar

... There . he "was, the youthful drum-,

Every man stayed in â for the boy!
Strangely .enough four of us caught on

I one room or two" Is not always
en easy matter. However, the
very essence of it all isâ"dain
ty." The appointments, of necessity,
ere en a small scale, and when they are
attractive and delicious to the last de
gree the hostess has nothing left to be
desired.
Again, it is not altogether a matter
cf 'â¢entertaining," either. Comfortable,
Â£a!nty, pleasing things are perhaps as
essential to the family's happiness In
their private home relations as to the
visitors* that come and go. But be that
e.s it mayâ whether the hostess is con
tent, when alone, with strictly simple
appointments or notâ the pretty, at
tractive serving of any dish is sure to
win the heart of the guest.
Silver plays an important part In all
household matters, so here, too, it lends
Its usefulness. In handling fruit there
ere many helps both in serving and eat
ing. The scissors, with their pretty era
bossed silver handles, are a practical
eld, as well as the different kinds of
fruit knives.
Speaking of grapes, the individual
"grape dip" Is a practical and most at
tractive manner of serving this fruit.
There is a deep tumbler, much the
chape of a bunch of grapes, set in a
silver stand something of the nature of
a soda-glass bolder. The glass is filled
partly with crushed ice. and a bunch of
grapes, first having been thoroughly
washed. Is placed in it. The advantage
of serving In this manner Is that the
grapes are kept perfectly fresh and
cool to the last minute when the tongue
touches the cc-ld drops of water on the
firm, clean grape. One important word
about grapes: Quantities of grapes
come from cold storage, having been
picked in late August or September. On
the whole, they keep well; but when
they come into the warmer air of
houses, or even outdoors, the stems
shrivel and the grapes fall at the
slightest touch, though the body of the
grape is still fresh and firm. An incon
venience to which no guest should be
subjected is to struggle with such
grapes They are successful rivals of the
eel when it comes to trying to keep them
where they belong. They roll out of
one's reach with exasperating ease. A
word to the wise hostess: Be sure to
test the grapes when purchasing them.
Use only the grapes that are firmly fas
tened to their stems.
A fruit salad Is a delicate dish which
appeals to most every one's taste. It is
composed of small pieces of banana,
pineapple, orange, peach, grapefruit,
apple, pear, pieces of nut (English wal
nut, almond, butternut) and maraschino
chrrries. The different fruits can be
varied according to their season, or, if

a truit salad is to place the little indi
vidual glass dish containing it in a sher
bet glass of crushed Ice. Ice is delicious
In so many ways, come to think of it.
It is a (aithful stand-by in all methods
of good serving. Add a few drops of
sherry, and the fruit salad makes a de
lightful dish. There are also low, flat
glass receptacles for the ice of a fruit
salad. That is a matter of taste.
One service for a grapefruit is a cut
glass bowl with a silver rim on a pret
ty china plate. This is for serving the
half fruit in its rind. Before placing
in the glass cup. the seeds and pulp
should be removed. Then each section
should be cut from the rind, so that it
may be lifted out easily with the spoon.
Two styles of spoon are illustrated
which are really orange spoons. Somo
people prefer the blunt, short bowl to
the grooved, narrow spoon.
But the best way to serve grapefruit is
In the fruit-salad dishes. Remove the
sections of the grapefruit, place them
Bide by side, .in their natural symmetri
cal order, in the small Individual slass
dish, and top them with maraschino
cherries. Then place this in the sherbet
glass of crushed ice. The sherry id last
but not least, and is put on, of course,
when the dlfh is eaten.
A most delightful idea is to color the
ice with cochineal. This lends a delicate
rose color, harmonizing beautifully with
the cherries and the pale shade of the
grapefruit It may be used with the
fruit salad also.

upon one day of the week. Let your

joyfully at home to them upon one
afternoon and evening out-of the
seven which make up the weekly
round. The announcement is a flat
tering assurance % that you wish to
be sure of seeing them when â¢ they
call. When a woman says: "I 'Have

SERVANTS'
DEVOTION
Some of the/Things Which
Make Her Life and
Yours Happier
Mary E. Carter
Copyright. 1306. by A. S. Barnes & Ca.
ONE of trie most attractive bed*
chambers that I ever saw as
signed to a household domes tic <
was in a very slrnple.inexpensivo
home of a young couple who were not
well off. according to the world's stand- â¢
ard. Their house was small and very
plain compared with. the average homes
of their friends and people of their cul
ture and standing. When I was there
they had but lately passed through
some trying financial struggles, and care
ful economy characterized their house
hold management in every department.
It was my good fortune to be taken over
that little home. What there impressed
me more than anything else was", the do
mestic's bedchamber.
I have, seen a great many rooms of
servants, many very nice ones, too: but
I was struck with that one as never be
fore in all my experience in mansions
palatial, handsome or ordinary. It was
as completely furnished as any one
could desire for making the toilet. The
floor was prettily carpeted: there was a
rocking chair, undoubted evidence that
the maid had time to sit down in her
own bedroom and enjoy it. The window
gave upon broad daylight., wtth nothing
to intercept the air or the light: the
shades and sash curtains were fresh and
dainty, and the entire room, with all its
appointments. Inviting enough to tempt
the most fastidious person.
A MODEL BOOM
It was not under a hot roof In summer,
neither was it cold in winterâ the season
that I was there. It was quite as warm -
then as the room of the mistress of that
dear little home. In fact, that ser
vant's bedchamber was more comfort
able and far more attractive looking
than many rooms where decayed gen
tlemen and women are obliged to dwell
when hard luck compels them to take up
their abode in lodgings In a great city.
And that unpretentious home was in one
of the largest cities of these United
States, but, of course, not in an exjen- \u25a0Â«
sivc quarter. I had never before met
the mistress. I have never seen her ~
since, but 1 understood very well why
her one maid was devoted to her service
and ready to do anything for her.
The mistress had a sweet, generous na
ture not hypnotized -by what "other
people"* were willing or unwilling to do
for their domestics. She followed the
trend of her own kindly disposition, and
did her best for her servant's comfort.
And, the result was that, when I made
my call there, the maid was taking all
of her mistress' meals up to her of her
own accord, because she thought that
she was not strong enough to go up and
down stairs.
. In .remarking upon her servant's de
votion, the mistress did not seem to re
alize that she herself had evoked thÂ»
best from her. by her own consideration
for her comfort and happiness while un
der, her roof. One who had gone to
her service a total stranger soon" be
came a loving, devoted handmaid and
the watchful guardian of her health.
INFLUENCES ALL GOOD
There is scarcely any one- so hope
lessly stack and degenerate as not to be
Influenced by Improved environment,
and there are few, however daintily
reared, so self-centred and established
In nice and orderly ways, who are not
apt to fall oft and go steadily downward
until they finally aro hardly recogniz
able by their old friendsâ lf they art
thrust away from ail of life's refine
ments. Most Improving influence often
reach us \u25a0 through what tha eyÂ» rest*
upon; frequently they are more potent
than what comes to us through the ear. .
It is too truÂ«, I know full well, that -4
there are some young people who hay* |
been reared in luxury and who have al
ways been surrounded by beautiful
-things, who are yet shockingly care
less, even worse than untidy, in their
own apartments, notwithstanding they
appear in public remarkably well groom
ed. But this la no reason why others
who have never had a chance in life,
and have never known any but rough,
uncouth surroundings, should be forever
debarred from what might evolve and
develop the best that is in them.
This is not a pie? for giving luxuries
to servants. It is more a protest, by
contrast, against what has been the rula
regarding the sort of places too often
tl* ought "good enough, for them."
Finally, they ought to have some closet
norn and good locks and keys to their
bi reau drawers, their bedchambers and
to ' their closet doors. The: servant's
room Is "her castle"â it to the only
place that she may call her own. What
ever privacy she has must be secured
to her there. The fact that she is a
stranger and a sojourner In the house,
by courtesy, entitles her to these things.
A COMFORTABLE BED
It seems strange , that one must even
speak of the servant's bed > to say that
it should be good, in- every respect a
restful spot for a tired . body, pleasant .
to look upon and decent in all its ap
pointments.
\u25a0 Here is an unquestionable fact: People
who are constantly changing their ser
vants are those who show, them tittle or
no consideration at any v time, whether
it be in the character , of . the rooms
given- to. them.- or when they are about
their household work. But a pleasant
room will be of little avail to one kept
so steadily at work, .from rising 'until/
bedtime, that: she will feel, too ttretLsjtL.
wash f and dress herself in the after
noon,'or (to keep her sanctum in order;
or '-. who is too much hurried tr jm one

down -. in : her room and. think her own
thoughts, ucalloytd with a mom c/

WOMEN'S WAYS OF EARNING MONEY
Cynthia Westover Alden
-Coprrlrbt. ISM. ty a. 6. Baraes & Co.
AS TO the qualifications for teach
ing, they are many, and one of
the least Important Is ability to
pass the scholastic examination
laid down by the powers that be. The
prises that the city schools afford can
only bo reached by young women who
have gone through a normal course, but
evÂ«n that Is but a beginning. Temper
ament Is tho chief qualification. Women
are preferred to icon in the teaching of
youiig children because of the potential
ra6.terr.lty In their natures that gives
them the key to the child's character.
Many girls are temperamentally un
fitted to become teachers. They are
hasty, harsh, ungoverned. hot-tempered.
If you are one of these, don't think of
the profession. Even if you have the
push to get an appointment, and the
caution to avoid doing anything to los*
It, your life will be a failure, of which
you will become more and more cogni
sant as the yeara go on. Children are
severe Judges. They have an intuition
\u25a0 as to a teacher's* weakness. They will
not pardon it. TThey will punish it la a
thousand ways. They are little imps
when it comes to methods of inflicting
such punishment, uud it's a great deal
more real than any punishments you
can devise for them.
Then ajfaln. it you don't love children,
don't love to havÂ»j them about you, find
them a nuisance in your private life,
keep out ot the schools. There never
wat a good teacher who did not ldVfe
children. I imagine there never will be.
What the educators call "discipline" is
\u2666 slavery. If not Informed with love.
Good trainers know that even young
animals can be brought to know things
and do things, and be useful only by
making them love you; that the whip is
impotent. And happily or unhappilyâ l
don't care to enter into that questionâ
the whip will be in effect out of your
reach as a teacher in the public schools.
I know that daring teachers often defy
the law; but they lay themselves liable
to removal for doing so, and that is a
risky business when plenty of others
are clamoring for your place. So you
may accept it as an axiom that you â¢
can't have discipline unless the children
love you and you love the children.
If you think of trying a teacher's ex
amination, begin at once to rule your
self. Are you In the habit of using
"sloppy" English, of breaking gram
matical rule*, of employing slang in
your dally conversation? Stop it at
once! It will not do. You expect to be
In a sense a model to thirty or forty or
fifty girls or boys. They will uncon
sciously imitate you. Do you want them
to go home and tell their mothers that
you say "don't" when you mean
"doesn't"; that you use a singular verb
with a plural subject: that you, employ
the very street expressions that they
have been warned not to use?
I think I hear come girl murmur de
fiantly: "I don't care. I should draw
my salary Just the same." I trust' for
the sake of the schools, the scholars
the parents that she at least will
never become a teacher.
Another matter of very real lmpor-
The Intuition Necessary in the Schoo 1 Teacher
tance is personal appearance, mat en
ters into everything, but here 't Is ab
solutely vital. The rule to be followed
is tc keep as near as possible to the con
ventional. Don't be careless, don't be
finickyâ be rational. Any article of wear
that is bound to be commented on by
your girls or your toys is to be avoid
ed. The well-dressed person In the school
is the person about whose clothes the
observer can remember nothing at all.
It seems absurd to remind you that
clean teeth, a clean breath and clean
finger nails are Indispensable. Yet I have
knownâ well. I can't tell you all I have
known In' this little space. It wouldn t
go in.
Conscience. . ;
I'm afraid almost every article of
this series has something about, con
science. This mustn't be an exception.
Your character will be as much a model
to your pupils as your dress or your
conversation. And if you shirk things
because you don't enjoy them thechil-.
dren will know it, and will criticise you
with their childish Implacability. If yon
are careless about your: promises or
reckless about your threats, they will
whisper among themselves: "Teacher
told a lie. didn't she? She said she would
punish Tommy If he did that again, and
he did, and she didn't"; or,<
"Teacher told a whopper again. She
paid she would give a pretty book to the
one that had most good marlcs, and she
didn't." And then some one will /say
apologetically, "1 guess she just forgot
all about it," and the answer will come
from a bosom ofÂ»hot indignation:
"Well, she hain't no right to forget;
my mother don't forget. When she says
a thing she does it."
You will note that the pupils of such
a teacher are not likely to be too par
ticular about their expressions..
Justice Is another point to be noted..
Xo punishment or even scolding of one
child for what another has done will ;
ever be forgiven. The victim of the
wrong will remember it, of course; but
so will every other child in the class.
â¢ The real offender will never have any
more respect for the teacher so long as
he lives. Children hate lying and hate in
justice. Besides, they have an ideal of
the teacher ; to which the real person
can only approximate. They like to think
that she is omniscient, that she can't be
"fooled." When they discover that she
can be, their confidence vanishes.^
The cleverest teachers 1 know wink at
a great many things, ignoring what they
cannot definitely fix responsibility for,
and wait till there is no chance for er
ror. By so doing they save their reputa
tions with their classes. :-"
Let . me repeat, then, for the sake of
emphasis, the qualifications of a teacher:
Finnâ Self control. ~, . \u25a0
Secondâ Love : of children.
Thirdâ Care as to personal appearance
and conversation. .. .
Fourthâ Conscientiousness In doing un
pleasant things.
Fifthâ A keen sense of justice.
fclxthâ Absolute truthfulness.
- Sevcuthrâ Enough knowledge to pass
the examination. \ -.
Having all of these you* will get a po
sition if you are , patient; you . will do

Â» Physical Culture.
- Thtre Is scarcely a modern, up-to-data
sen 001 that does not have In Its faculty
a teacher of physical culture. A correct
development of the muscles means all
manner of bodily grace,' and through
the training of the physical side of one's
nature the mental becomes keener and
more ready to receivo outward Impres
sions. . â¢ \u25a0 . V
An authority on 'this subject tells me
that many persons who travel thrqugh
the world with htlff, ungainly bodies
and awkward movements might be just
as easy and graceful ns some envied
friend if they only knew .what grace is
and how it could be acaulred.
This instructor adds: "Of late years
the dramatic school has been the finish
ing school where" many a crudo maiden
has. by careful study, developed Into a
pollÃhed woman." ; '
Teachers of this branch receive the
salaiy of the average school teacher. 7

POINTS FOR THE WOMAN WITH ONE SERVANT
Seryine a Dinner :for Sixâ -How She Can. Manage it With Ease
Eleanor B. Clapp
Copyright, 1905, by Ar a Barnes &: Co. _
THE rinexperienced maid should be ;
instructed that everything should
Jibe passed at the left side. of the
person who Is; being. served. Be- - :
fore , announcing J dinner she 'Â« should see
that; all she can possibly; want during
the meal" is on the sideboard; for In
stance, the requisite number of spoons
and^ forks for the different dishes, and
In addition to these a few spoons and
forks, both large and small, and a knife
I . or two, *ln case they 'should -be needed,,^
and also an ample eunply of : bread.
. > As soon as the family are seated at
dinner, the cover from. : the soup^. tu
reen I should \u25a0be i removed, and the maid
should be \u25a0in attendance on the left of
the master to take each plate of soup,
as he Helps It,- to > the ; various persons
* at : table, i .: As ' soon as the -soup , Is';fln
â¢ lshed, the opiates should be ' removed,
and the ; tureen should -be replaced 'as
quickly -as possible by the fish;' if this
ris served from the table, the maid will
:proceed ln?Â»Just :the same- way;, as for:. :
â¢the' soup,: but If/it isa "made-up" dish

â¢-i In Â» serving the simple little dinner de- i
scrlbed.l place, the salad with its plates; ]
pne<j up beside ft upon the sideboard or
serving table, put the Ice cream plates
there also, and the proper utensils for
serving them, as well as an extra sup
ply of tablespoons and a carafe filled
with cold water for refilling the glasses.
After she ha? put the chicken in the
oven to roast . and prepared the vege
tables, the maid should set the table.
If guests are expected it is well
for . the I mistress to give her some
assistance, as one pair of hands,' how
ever willing, cannot do tha work of cook
and waitress for half a dozen people.
When everything is woll under way
the maid should change her gingham
mornlmr gown for a simple black draja
with white apron, collar and cuffs, and a
waitress' cap If she will wear it. but
most general servants object to this last
touch, so it Is not' well to insist. When
everything is ready, and the hour for
dinner has arrived, the maid goes to the
drawing-room door and quietly an
nounces to her mistress that "Dinner
is served." When the guests are seated
she brings In \the soup .in a tureen,
which she places before her mistress; a
pile of hot soap plates are then brought
in and placed beside the tureen, she
then stands at the left side ot her mis
tress with a small tray, covered with a
doily. In her left hand, and takes the
plates ot soup as soon as they axe filled
and passes them at the left side or each
Kuest. taking the soup off the tray with
her right hand and placing It in front
of each person. .
After the soup plates have been re
moved the roast is brought in with Its
hot plates. This Is carved and served la
.the same manner as the soup.after which
the maid immediately begins to pass
the vegetables that accompany it. These
vegetables are not put on the table, but
brought from the Kitchen, where they
have been kept warm, and passed on
the tray to each guest, who helps him
self from the dish. At the salad course
the plates, cold this time naturally, axe
placed before each person, and the salad
passed -on the tray. The salted almonds'
are passed between the courses by those
at the table. After the salad the crumbs
are brushed from the table, and then
the dessert is served. This, with its pila
of plates, is set in front of the hostess,
who dishes It out. and tha maid parses
each ' person's * portion upon her tray.
The bonbons can be passed .with tho
dessert, or can accompany the -coffee.
as one desires. The dessert plates aro
removed, and the maid then brings in
the black coffee, direct from the kitchen,
carrying several cups . upon her tray at
once -and passing one to each guest. She
then retires from the dining room.
The . guests should be served in turn
as they sit, first a gentleman and then
a lady, as this is the quickest and mosc
correct way to manage it. The host or
hostess, ' whichever is serving, appropri
ately, takes the last plate.
' The manner of serving a luncheon Is
in the â¢main the same as a dinner.
. In small cities or country places where
it Is customary to dine In the middle ot
the day, Â« a dinner party, unless it is a
Sunday dinner, Is rarely given, but sup
per parties are the correct form of en
tertainment. These are very easy to
manage, as they are customarily served
in but two or at most three courses, to
the duties of the -waitress are grtÂ»Uy
lessened.NAME PUZZLES

AMOROUS BARON CAPTIVE IN CELLAR
Imprisoned by Alan Whose Daughter He Tried to Kidnap
PRETTY RUSSIAN GIHL,_HER
FATHER AND BARON WHOM
THEY OUTWITTED.
Special C3al>le to The Call.
ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. Â».â Little by
little there have come from the remote
ItuESlan orovince of Kazan the com
jilete details of one of the most ex
traordinary dramas which even this
modern wonderland has ever yielded.
Four years ago. Baron -Liupianoff, a
wealthy Russian nobleman and.land
owner, endeavored to kidnap a girl
named Olg* ostreisky. the daughter of
a rich fur merchant named Ivan Ontrel
*ky, in order to make her his wife.
Instead of abductinK the object of his
ardent affections, the Baron himse f
was kidnaped by the girl's, famer,
Ivan ostreisky. and incarcerated in the
merchant's cellar for four years, by way
of drastic punishment for his projected
outrage Baron Liupianoff \u0084h as now
V't'n liberated from his imprisonment,
and much against, bis-own will,- has
l>e*n compelled to make the .story, of
liis remarkable Imprisonment public in
order to enforce liis own rights of prop
â¢â¢rty.
One fateful day "Baron Liupianoff,
was then 30 years old, set eyes
on Oljra Oetrelsky. who at that. time
J.4d just passed her sixteenth birthday
and was, a girl of striking beauty. She
was tall and dark, with flashing black

eyes and jet black half. Baron,Liupi
anoff, woman-hater as he had' been for
a long time, was fascinated by her
charms and bega.* assiduously, to. court
her in. the hope of persuading her to
be his wife. He had; come into contact
with the girl through business; trans
actions with her father, who."still.car
ried on business as a dealer in. furs. ;
Ivan Ostrelsky's business establish
ment was situated in the city of Kazan, :
but the merchant resided in the .vicin
ity of Kasanbazh, some thirty; miles
from the capital of the province. 'His
wife had died. soon after his daughter's
birth and Ol&a.was committed to" the
care of. an English governess,- Miss
King. The nobleman made; a 'formal
proposal of marriage, but was rejected.
CAUGHT IX HIS OWN TRAP.
Henceforth Baron Liupianoff .plotted
and* planned and schemed to kidnap the ''<
merchant's .beautiful daughter. .' Fin-"
ally, an opportunity presented 'itself on
the occasion of the midnight; service
I held in .the cathedral v at Kazan on
Easter Sunday. '.The Baron, by means
of his spies, ascertained that Miss;Os
trelsky" and ; her; governess Intended to
drive from the villa to Kazan on the
j Sunday evening and to meet Ivan
'\u25a0 Ostreisky at the fcathedral. The two
! women would accordingly be alone and
! almost unprotected during tho long
drive of thirty milesfand tfie Baron
perceived that this would be an ex
cellent opportunity of carrying out ' his
plan of kidnaping the girl.,'
; Notwithstanding the lawlessness pre
7vailing In Russia and the license which
aristocratic magnates: enjoy, the project
was" a dangerous r one: ! and the 1 Baron'
Intrusted the secret only. to two:accom
plices.-his own groom arid his own per
sonal valet, both sturdy muscular'fel
lows.
On the evening of. Easter Sunday the
Baron and: his two' retainers :JeftHhe
castle mounted 'on powerful . steeds^and
armed , ; with - revolver* and daggers, 'â¢* and â¢
provided with manacles. T gags :.ahd

which Baron Liupianoff .had - planned

seeing, an opportunity^ for^a liberal re

I So; "instead of allowing . his daughter
and her,' governess ; to^ drivel at . night \u25a0to

of his own strongest retainers ? in v the

who make friends in all directions, and
there is ~ genuine regret that she should

her friends, "Now be sure you speak to

\ The improvements in the park which

â¢of i the bond election have been planned
upon a very practical basis with a view
to making Alum I^ock Park eventually
one of the most' famous watering places
in the country; but with the Immediate
object of . rendering it self-supporting.

.The jboard also '\u25a0 intends -to develop" all of
the .â¢ existing mineral j springs, .. : bringing
their â¢ waters down â¢; into . . an attractive
kiosk near, the ; center /of the park. The

may have .the comparative * freedom of

within view of visitors. The boulevard
into the reservation is to be widened so as
to insure absolute comfort, and safety . for
all sorts of \u25a0 vehicles,- while other drives
and; byways are to be laid out in accord
ance with the designs of some landscape
artlst'of established reputation. The city
recently | acquired . : a; number . of valuable

BLANCHE PARTINGTON
Friddles." at your service, and the
"Countess Fixer," otherwise Mr. Fred
erick Truesdell, and Miss Dorothy Ten
nant of "The College Widow." I do
not see why I should be serious, as
they were not. Utterly absurd it is to
say that plays have no effect upon the
I'layers. Mrs. Beerbohm Tree is, how
over, sure that they have. She says
tnat whenever Mr. Tree Is playing the
sinner at the theater he plays two
eaints at home. Conversely â but that
is between Mr. Tree and his Maker.
It is not that way with these col
legians of "The College Widow." . It
might have been one of the "frat"
houses where I saw them. Instead of a
mere ordinary hotel. They might have
been a couple of gray students, instead
of serious player-folk, with a recent
train wreck and yellow fever "quaran
tine to their credit. Quips and quirks,
nicknames and banter new like nothing:
as much as a fifth act to "The College
I TVidOW."
I had invited Mr. Truesdell to the
"college widow's" drawing-room, and
there found him. He was draping
one end of a couch. That was how I
discovered the "Countess Fixer." The
couch was narrow and the actor is not.
It was after I had been comfortably
"flxed" by my hostess that her capable
blue eye wandered Mr. Truesdell's way.
Two cushions followed, but still the
actor's angle did not suit Miss Ten
rant. She got up again and then "com
manded" him to an arm chair.
"Oh, 'Count *as Fixer!" " he laughed
and divulged, as he slipped into the
chair like Jelly into a mold, "that Is
what we call Miss Tennant. She Is
never happy unless she Is fixing some
thing."
"Friddles:" rebuked Miss Tennant;
then defended herself: "I'm going to
'fix* things if I can make people more
comfortable â half of them don't know
what is the matter with them any
way."
" 'Frlddles!' " was Mr. Truesdell's
back snat, "that I won't stand forâ"
"Everybody in the company," Miss
Dorothy triumphed, "says that it is the
fittest nickname they ever heard!"
And so on.
But last time Mr. Truesdell was here
he was a very serious person. Indeed,
In Mrs. Langtry'e serious comedy "Mrs.
Deerlng's Divorce." So I said: "Mrs.
Lengtryâ "
Mr. Truesdell and Miss Tennant
grinned fraternally at each other.
. "Say "Robert Edeson' to me," Miss
j'cnr.ant advised.
I sa.id it.
"Well." Miss Dorothy elucidated, "I
like Robert Edeson Just about as well
as Freddy likes Mrs. Langtryâ "
"Oh. tell about it," I asked.
I had forsrotten that Mr. Truesdell
j- a poet. That was the first thing
3 knew of him â that he had submitted
tome verse to George Sterling for
criticism. He had been proud to get
the Sterling "Go on,-"t>Tother." I re
ir.embered the fact with a thud at the
cctor's next words.
"Were Mrs. Langtry's eyes so won
derful." I had asked, "that brilliant,
vitreous turquoise that so fascinated
one from the front?"
Perhaps that they were carved from
the heart of a glacier, he told me, but
Jt was the "implacable profile" â think
of it In conection with the Langtry, the
'â¢implacable profile" â that struck me.
I thank thee. "Friddles," for teaching
mÂ«* that word!
It is not best to be next to that "im-~
placable profile'" as employe, Mr. Trues
ct-11 thinks, when its owner "has the whip
hand of you." Cold, severe as the profile
is the lady, as haughty, as exacting. Tre
mendously hard to act with she is. With
til the chiseled will of the profile, Mrs.
Langtry lacks the concentration neces
sary to project herself over the foot
!j?hts, 6ays her late leading man. Her
eyes are all over the stage, questioning:
"Is that chair right? How hangs my
gown? Who Is that making a noise be
hind the scenes?"
""I was never more surprised than when
] first met Mrs. Langtry after-seeing her
on the stage," he went on, "to find out
how much more there was of her than
i -was apparent from the front. I expected
to see a heavy, stolid, rather dense per
ron, but she is as sensitive as a finely
strung instrumentâ has a most delightful
wit."
That sounded more like the Langtry of
whom one had heard, I remarked. "And
as to that." I queried, femininely, "what
<if the famous fascinations of the Jersey
Lily? Did she never waste them upon
mere actors? Had he never feltâ"
Mr. Truesdell began with a leisurely
â¢Wellâ"
"Go on, Freddy," MiEs Tennant. who is
enythlng but leisurely, commanded..
And Mr. Truesdell put It this way:
"Just occasionally, then, I felt Mrs. Lang- '
try's fascination. It was always In some)
ecene on the stageâ when she would for
get herselfâ or, no, when she would forget j
meâ she never forgot herself, actually,
â¢when," he analyzed further, "when she ,
caw some one else in my shoesâ"
"A vicarious flirtation!"
"Not exactly that, either." he dissected,
"for the character man got more of It I
than I didâ we used to talk about it. But |
Mrs. Langtry's lapses Into humanness \u25a0
were not frequent." j
I recalled his connection of Mrs. Lang- I
try's acting with the term "psychic."
He meant here, he explainedâ Miss Ten
rant looking on with fraternal admira
tionâan abnormal sensitiveness.
"A psychic person rarely gets over the
footlights," he added. "I think this Is
whyâ they are unable to cut off the scores
of confusing impressions that come from
the audience. That is the paradox of act-
Ing. You need supreme sensitiveness to
CHANCE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN ART SCHOOL
Good news! ,
One hundred thousand dollars presented
to the regents of the University of Cali
fornia for the Improvement of the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Artâ a neat little
Christmas package from Mr. Searles of
Great Barrington, who thus proves him
self not averse to using Hopkins dollars
to apotheosize Hopkins memoriesâ which
makes b!m out not such a bad fellow,
after all.
Well, the Institute needs it-
And It need* more. In point of fact, It
needs a lot more. It needs a new house,
fitted to its needs, and In a more accessi
ble location. It needs a larger corps of
teachers in Its School of Designâprinci
pally colorists and men whose knowledge
of the principles of art is unquestionedâ
If tsuch there beâ and for the sweet sake
of harmony, let the seal of Old World ap
proval emblazon the brow of the worthy.
Let us have men whose conception of art
L*s broad and big and virile, as befits the
broad West, the product of liberal
education, not only in art as a concrete
thing, but in the corollary lines of general
knowledge.
As dean of the Instituteâ and its most
impression, and at the same time the
power to cut off at will all the Impres
sions, all the currents of influence that
do not contribute to success."
Miss Tennant shivered and said, ap
parently painfully apropos: "Last
night, Freddyâ"
He replied: "Last night!â"
"What was the matter with last night?"
I asked. I had been there, at the Colum
bia, and their first performance looked
like an unalloyed triumph to me.
"Oh, what we suffered those first two
acts!" cried Miss Tennant. "You were
frightfully cold., I thought we were
gone â "
"Went broke quite on the reception (the
faculty reception), didn't we?" Truesdell
chimed in. .
"Of course, I was frightened to death
anyway," the "college widow" said.
"Coming home, you knowâ all the girls
there, and, you like to roast home
folks, you know."
"I'm more afraid of playing San Fran
cisco than other place in Americaâ"
"I told the stage manager that I really
couldn't go .on again. 'You little fool,' he
said, 'you've played the part 609 times in
New York. Go on, and laugh, laugh!"
But I hadn't a laugh left In my sys
temâ" \~ //:/;
Some more of this and then I cried:
"Mercy! Hit one of your own size!"
This appealed to the two Ade collegians.
And here to say that as Mr. Truesdell
most handsomely looks the college ath
lete, so Is Miss Tennant a splendid speci
men of young womanhood. Californlan
she Is, and tall, lithe, supple and rounded
of figure as only California makes its
best. Fair she Is, blue and cool of eye.
red of mouth and rose and white of skin.
Her hair, dusky gold, has a little forgot
ten the California sun.
I got from under to ask: "Well, with
all your troubles, isn't this what you
would rather be doing than anything
else?"
"What about it, Freddy?" Mias Dor-,
othy asked. "For me I want to get
out of it. I used to think I wanted a
career and all that eort of thing. But
I'm bravely over it. I didn't care a
bit for the domestic life, but now" â
a little, tender, unserious, glrly sigh
finished the sentence. "I hardly think
It \u25a0was Intended for me."
But Miss Tennant promptly quashed
the pathetic strain with: "If you had
only been on the road wjih vs â Wheel
but we have had a tough time! There
was the yellow fever quarantine. There
was the railroad "wreckâ ow! Every
little unusual noise we hear -on the
train now we think she's gone again."
"That was the night we began to
play at 10 o'clock," from Truesdell. "And
the people wouldn't take their money
back," the "college widow" added.
Shrewd and mischievous fun was in
her description of the Montgomery
public. "They like to be 'on,' you know.
They would meet and say: ' "The Col
lege Widwo" was In the wreck." 'No!'
'Yes!' "Let's go and see them.' 'Can't
get in till late, gentlemen.' This Is the
box-office â 'Want your money back?'
"No sir!' â They weren't going to be
fooled Into missing a wrecked theatri
cal troupe! There wasn't one tlqket
turned in. And we ended up at* some
thing to 1 o'clock. And then didn't we
have ham and eggs!"
"Didn't we!" Mr. Truesdell blithely
assented. "But do you remember those
cold veal pies with the files in them?"
"Ugh!" didn't she! "You know," she
added to my railroad information, "In.
the wild States, when there are only
theatrical people of the tame tribes
traveling, this happens: 'What, only
actors'.' they say, "yank oft* the Pull
mans!' and then . we have cold veal
pies, undated, and ten minutes to eat
them in. Oh, I can hardly believe I'm
at home. Neither can mother. She
left just the minute you came In â
wanted to meet you too. But what
do you think she says? 'My poor child,
I don't believe you are really here â
shan't until you're gone!' That's the
way I feel."
A little Tennant history followed.
Six years ago Dorothy Tennant left
here to study at a New York dramatic
school. High comedy she likes, and
thinks that it is wisest not to play
Juliet. One of her teachers rather im
pressed her that way.
"They gave me Juliet once," she re
counted, giggling. "This Is what Sar
gent said about me. .It was all right
up to the potion scene though. He
said: 'This is you: "Romeo, Romeo!
Get thee behind me, there are others!"
You'd never die for any man'â no
more I would," she .ended up. I
"But," she went on, "it was John
Drew who first encouraged m>. I told
him what I wanted, and he told me I
had a few things In my favor and to
'get In and win." When I went East,
this one and that one said 'don't' â
they're always ready to holler "don't!'
Mrs. Le Moyne was one and I said to
her, 'But how did you?' "
First with Mary Mannering then
came Miss Tennant's public experience;
then inspiring time in Henry .Miller's
splendid companies, and \u25a0 later two j
years with - Robert Edeson .as leading i
womanâ "which was not his fault,'' j
she put It. 1 . .
With Daly's, for several years was
"The College Widow's" half-back, I
learned then. He took Joseph Her
bert's place as comedian In musical
comedy, played four performances a
week }n musical comedy and four in
Shakespeare at that famous theater.
"He* Isn't such a youngster, as he
looks," chaffed the lady.
"Was It musical comedy or Shakes
peare that he preferred?" I asked.
"Oh. Freddy goes more into Shakes
peare," his hostess answered for. him.

had been able to wrench him from : the
diplomatic service, he replied: "That was

Miss Tenr.ant shrieked gently and told
me to set down; "roars of laughter here!"
"Funny thing," she added, "about our
company. Every now and then one man
will say to another: 'You know, I 'was

the other says. 'So was I.'. There are

whole company has "gone athletic," jl

" Ceremonies.
PARIS, Dfec. 9.â French* and foreign
masters of dancing and deportment met
this week in congress here to dlscus3
dancing, fashion, breeding, deportment and
everything relating thereto. Air. Robert-
Bon. onÂ© of the British delegates, recalled
the fact that Kins Edward accepted the
dedication of a dance called La Pavane
Mondatne, and . it was decided to send
him an address of admiration.
A debate followed on the respective
merits of the frock coat and evening
dress. The president of tha congress ex
pressed the opinion that it was a lucky
thing for society that the professors of
dancing and deportment were ever on the
watch, as otherwise Paris soon would lose
its reputation for good taste. The mem
bers heartily agreed with this view and
passed a resolution that frock coats
should be banished from marriage cere
monies.
PUTS ASIDE THE SWORD
TO TAKE UP THE PKÂ«
Former War Minister Berteaox ox
France Becomes Writer (or
Radical Paper. '
PARIS. Dec. 9.â Ex-War Minister Ber
teaux, not satisfied with his return to the
Stock Exchange, to which he owes his
Immense wealth, has taken to journalism
and will write editorially for the ultra
radical Journal La Lanterne. which dur
ing his administration was a ferocious
enemy of the existing military system
and no sparer of Berteaux himself.
The Minister fallen from power is more
arid more being thought of- as a quixotic
paladin and the most paradoxical person
age of current politics, richest of the up
setter3 of social order and multimillion
aire socialist Journalist.
People are saying that If he could only
learn to control his vicious irritability
and acquire political tact he might be
come a veritable creator of forma In

Trro Years for Lese Majeste.
DRESDEN, Dec. fcâ Theodor Hohen
steln, a poor waiter whose opinion of the
King of Saxony Is not very high, has
been sentenced to the extraordinary term
of two years' Imprisonment for lese
majeste. For libeling the Kaiser the
severest sentence in recent years was
nine months. Hohen.yein'a offense took
the form of a post card written to a
friend, a gendarme, who laid the Infor
mation. Hohenstein alluded to the King's
family affairs in an unbecoming way.
Orchids for Her Guests.
PARIS, Dec. 9.â Mrs. John Jacob Holt
has the distinction of paying the hlghes:
floral bills, in Paris. Her "literary teaa"
consume Hundred* of dollars' worth of
orchids and roses and whatever else Is
rare and out of season. "Wherefore every
one knew who was referred to when a
cynic spoke in a certain salon of "ex

many single blossoms that appear In her

Americans do not reform their munici

European critic" "recently, because they
do not want reform. The fact that so"
many cities In thV United States are gov
erned In the Interest of party machines
instead of in the interest of the people
would seem to substantiate this harsh
comment on our citizenship and institu
tions. In ,our great prosperity It has
seemed to be Immaterial whether public
revenues should be devoted to the last
cent to public use 3. We have tolerated
the grafter in office and the tribute-tak
ing politician on the outside far longer
than these unworthy types would be tol
erated in Europe. Of course, there-, are
corrupt men in the Old World, but no
where except in the United States can
the spectacle be seen , of men jumping
from poverty to immense wealth In a few
years, suspected by every one of dishon
est ' practices, and yet permitted to dom

WOTKING SOCIETY WOMEN
SALLY SHARP
It cannot now be said of the smartest
of the smart maids, as in Solomon's
time, that "they toil not, neither do
they spin-"
There are two types of smart-set
maids â those with brains and those
without.
Necessarily, those without "toil not,
neither do they spin" â simply because
they haven't brains enough to toil or
â¢pin,
It takes all their time to dream,
smoke, eat pickles, dress and go to
teas, where they "giggle, gabble, gob-
Ue and tit."
These smart maids who work do it
because they relish the thrill of accom
plishmentâbecause they are wise enough
to realize that without work there can be
:io play â no contrast.
At the exhibition at the Guild of Arts
and Crafts held a.t the St. Francis, and
closed yesterday, the array of society
maids and matrons who were working
seriously was something of a revela
tion.
Among these skillful craftswomen,
most of whom had samples of
workmanship on view, were Miss de
Guigne, Miss Edith Chesebrough. Miss
Dorothy Collier. Mrs. Albert Dibblee,
Misses Olivia and Milward Holden.
Mrs. Thomas Olney, # (nee Selby). Miss
Eleanor Plaw, Miss Clara nice. Miss
Jloni Taussig, Mrs. Albertine Randall
Wheelan and Mrs. R. Gilman Brown.
Now, these young women really do
things. They don't belong to the guild
that begin things and forget to finish
them.
Especially is this true of Miss de
Guigne. Miss Chesebrough and Miss
Rosa Taussig, all of whom presented
finished products in the line of exqui
eite bookbindings, the first two show
ing types of the French art, and Miss
Taussig the English, both excellent ex
emplars of their respective schools.
Then there Is Ethel Hagcr, who has
turned out some very interesting things
In modeling â notably a siren of the
sea; and the De Young girls, who are
diligent students of music, Miss Helen
a devotee of the harp.
In the. province of letters. Miss Agnes
Tobin has won international distinction
by her exquisite translation of Pe
trarch, whose vibrant soul seems to
find response in the soul of the young
woman who sitteth by the side of the
Turquoise Sea.
And thus do emart maids and ma
trons toll and spin â they that have the
brains. There are those who pursue
the primitive arts with equal intelli
gence â cooking and sewing and the
tearing of babies. Of these we shall
hear later.

Tuesday was quite .usurped by the
twin gods of love, the treading of the
hymeneal path holding attention until the
near close of day. when Cupid sprang
to view with six newly pierced hearts.

ears, for with the ever present interest in

additional sentiment. :' -

that was beautiful and artistic.
The groom owns fine plantations In
Kauai, the only regret attached to
which fact being that he Â«nust carry
from among this gay realm his bride,
who is a maid to be widely missed.
Miss Elizabeth Smith of Scotland
was wedded to Dr. Samuel J. Gardner.
the Southern Pacific surgeon, at 9
o'clock In the Palace Hotel, where she
has been the guest of her sister. Mrs.
George L. Fish, since last March.
This event was quietly solemnized,
only a limited number being bidden.
The color Idea of blue and white
was most effectively observed, and all
I the gowns of the bridal party were
truly beauteous, the unmistakable mart
of foreign modistes being staiaped
upon each.
Rev. Kirk Guthrie officiated. After a

BIG CANCER lIM
EACH BREAST
IN WOMAN'S BREAST
ANY LUMP IS CANCER
The most wonderful cure of cancer
on record is the case of Mrs. G. N. Mor-
ris of 224% First street, Portland. Ore-
gon. She. had a small lump In one
breast which suddenly poisoned deep,
and caused a cancer also In the other
breast, when each breast became al-
most as large as a person's head, and
cure was thought to be Impossible.
About that time the papers were full of
commendations about another marvel-
ous cure by Dr. and Mrs. Dr. Chamley
& Co. of 25 Third street, San Francisco,
who cure cancers without knife or pain,
charge nothing until cured and offer
$1000 if they fall on any cancer or tu-
mor they treat before It has poisoned
deep glands or caused any hemorrhage.
Such cases they always refuse as past
cure. She wrote for their free book,
which teaches that any lump in a wo-
man's breast is cancer. She saw a dozen
or more people here and wrote to oth-
ers, all of whom praised and thanked
Dr. Chamley for saving their lives.
They cured Mrs. Morris In two weeks.
They use no X-Ray fraud nor mail or-
der swindle. His book is full of testi-
monials from doctors, ministers, bank-
ers and others, such as E. J. (Lucky)
Baldwin, Arcadia, Cal., who was said to
be dying three years ago with cancers,
and was cured by Dr. Chamley; B. BY Por-
ter, Second Vice-President and General
Manager of San Francisco and North-
western Railway Co., Eureka, Cal.; Mrs.
Elizabeth Crosthwaite. President of
Golden Gate Woman's Club, 954 Arling-
ton Avenue, Oakland, Cal., cured, of
cancer In breast and armpit. They, as
well as Mrs. Morris and scores of oth-
ers, say Dr. Chamley Is, without doubt,
the most successful cancen specialist
living.. He has the name of having
cured more cancers in just one-third of
a century than any other Doctor living.
PABK COMMISSIO.VEUS
HOLD REGULAR SESSION
Pole* for Extension of Electric Rall-
Tvajr on Pulton Street, From Tnen- .
ly-I"(turth Avenue to Ocean.
The Board of Park Commissioners
held a regular" session Friday after
noon. President A. B. Spreekels presid
ing. Commissioners Dingee, Metsdn
and Cummings were present. The re
port of Superintendent McLaren for
the month of November gave a list of
men and teams employed on all
branches of park work. Reference was
made to the progress of improvements
at Mission Park, Alta Plaza and Buena
Vista Park.
Manager Chapman of the United
Railroads addressed the board, setting
forth the purpose of the company to
extend the electric railway on Fulton
street, from Twenty-fourth to Forty
eighth avenue, near the ocean. He
asked the judgment of the board in the
matter of placing the . poles, saying
that the company would be guided by
the wishes of the Park Commission.
He remarked that the placing of the
poles on the park line or inside of the
line would give a .wider driveway 'on
the street and enhance the view of the
thoroughfare. The construction would
be the same as that on Oak street, an
ornamental construction of iron poles.
Permission to i place '. the poles on or
near the park line, but not inside of it,
was granted, * with the distinct under
standing that the line should be desig
nated by Superintendent McLaren.
/ A communication was received from
the Park Commissioners of Los Ange

\u25a0was made.of the gift of two pairs of

Good Gliance of Being'Cierk
of Board of Supervisors
\u25a0It, being the general understanding, that
Herbert Schmitz, the, brother of .Mayor
Schmitz, who is now, ' secretary of the
Park Commission, is , sure 1 , of , 'being, pro
moted to a tbeUer position, f the political
gossips are figuring that he :wlll \u25a0 eventu-^
ally succeed John I 'McLaren "as Superin
tendent of. the Parks. McLaren '. has in
curred the displeasure ;of Ruef â¢ and
Schmitz on account of his. affiliation Vwith
the Republican League. The. gossips rea
son that Herbert" Schmitz has â¢ acquired
considerable experience in the Vadminis
tration of park affairs, and the fact, that
hia salary would.be doubled as;superin
tendent would be an incentive for his
promotion.
It Is certain that Herbert will land, a
more lucrative plum, and somo, other po
sition of equal dignity may.be his if he
does not get the park superintendency,
which McLaren may after all hold on. to
despite what has been said. " -; ; .
As soon as the place for Herbert has
been picked out it is on the cards for
James de Succa to reassume .his old place
as secretary of the Park Commission,
from which he voluntarily resigned in or
der tolmake a place for Herbert, â¢ who
made a graceful exit as Commissioner of
Public Works nearly a year ago. . ' De
Succa is now Etorekeeper of the Board of
and his transfer will make an-;
other position available for the adminis
tration .to fllir"' . ' : \u25a0
The man who now appears to have\the
inside track for the. clerkship of the
Board of Supervisors appears from all In
dications to be Edward Lynch, a clerk
in Abe Ruef's office. \u25a0.-,'' Both". Ruef and
Schmitz desire George Keanev the Mayor's
secretary. â¢ to accept the place, but Keane
is sidestepping the desire. Keane has_
other political aspirations, notably that
of being a Superior Judge, and he thinks
that a clerkship would not.- lend j dignity
to his ambitions. .- George Boyne,; who
has been mentioned' for. place, has
been told that he will continue to shine
as secretary of tho Police â¢ Commission.. ,-'
It is understood- that Albert j Ms? j Arm
strong, who once ; had. an ambition to
succeed Langdon ' as . Superintendent ot
Schools, will be attorney, for Public Ad
ministrator-elect Joseph Stiilz, nbw'that
Alfred Roncovleri, -president of the Board
of Education, seems reasonably sure of
the first named appointment. \u25a0 Roncovierl
says he has not been' asked: to take; the
superintendency, but if his country calls
him to serve in that capacity he, will
cheerfully obey the call.
It is said that the Ruef-Schmltz com
bination is negotiating for the. purchase
of a local evening newspaper, and if the
deal goes through School Director Boyle
will resign and assume the management
of the journal. Boyle would probably be
appointed to some $100 a month commis
slonershlp, and -might resume his former
place on the Election Commission or, some
similar post. There would thus be two
vacancies on the School Board to fill.
All sorts Of rumors are flying about as
to .probable appointees under the new
regime. It is Eaid that the successor, as
secretary of the Civil Service Commission
to Edward Moran, who will be appointed
Civil Service Commissioner, has been se
lected, but his name is kept secret. It is
said that George Benham, now Chief
Deputy Tax Collector, will be the man.
Civil Service Commissioner Williams was
after the place, but it is. said has given
up the flght. John G. Fitzgerald is certain
of being rewarded, and a courtroom clerk
ship may be in store for him.

SUNDAY ....DECEMBER 10, 1905
THE OVERHEAD TROLLEY.
WHETHER a new franchise is required or an overhead trolley
may be used by the United Railroads under a permit, it
should be understood that San Francisco opposes the over
head system. Market street is now comparatively free of over
head wires. The" people look forward to the time when all electric
wires, for whatever purpose, will be put underground. To permit
the overhead trolley will simply delay that desirable consummation.
That system is the most objectionable of all overhead wiring.
The poles "have to be more numerous than in any other use of
electricity. The guy wires and conductors form a network over
the whole street. Breaks are not only liable but sure to occur,
endangering life in the street and sending currents over other
wires that destroy insulation and cause fires, that are more difficult
to extinguish because of the net of wires that is responsible for
them. Electricity is a necessity as a motor and a means of tele
phone and telegraph communication, but the people pay generously
for its use and are entitled to its enjoyment under conditions that
neither deface the streets nor render them unsafe. '
It is not for the representatives of the United Railroads to de
cide that the overhead system is the best for San Francisco. They
mean by that that such system is the best for the corporation they
represent, which is no doubt true. It is the best in that sense be
cause it is less expensive than the underground trolley. It can be
installed much cheaper. But it is for the people and their repre
sentatives to decide what is best for the city. A vast majority be
lieve, on knowledge and not on assumption, by guesswork or rule
of thumb, that the underground system is 'the best for the city.
It costs more for installation, but after it is installed the difference
in cost of operation, in convenience and safety, favors it rather than
an overhead system.
The people of San Francisco stand by their owft rights with
out desiring to injure the United Railroads in any way. It is a mis
take for the representatives of that corporation to assume that the
majority of our citizens desire the underground wires from a wish
to injure the owners of the roads. While there is great room for
betterment in equipment and accommodations, it is undeniable that
our surface transportation has been vastly improved since it fell
almost entirely under a single management, and is run by a system
of transfers which enables quick and cheap travel between all parts
of the city. There is no lack of appreciation of what has been done,
and notwithstanding some harping over bygone events, there is no
general ill feeling against the, company.
The corporation can less afford to change this condition than
can the city. But a change is risked by insistence upon the overhead
trolley. The corporation should weigh wisely and deliberately what
such a change in the disposition of the people implies. It means far
more than the difference in cost between the two systems. This is
no threat. It is merely a conclusion drawn from the experience of
every city in the United States that has been the scene of such an
unfortunate controversy as is likely to be precipitated here.
The United Railroads may read a useful lesson in the policy
of the great steam railroad systems of the Union. They, too, are
prosperous.. But they submit to a suspension of dividends to devote
their income to betterments that give the public a better service.
Old established lines like the Pennsylvania and the New York
Central have in that way improved their physical condition, have
taken out dangerous curves, lowered grades, substituted earthen
substructure for trestles, have put stone* arch bridges in place of
metal structure become unsafe by molecular change, and have begun
the abolition of grade crossings. These things have been done vol
untarily. The companies have not waited to be forced to it by con
siderations of public safety and convenience. They have seen that
it is the best policy to be at one with the public they serve.
It will be the part of wisdom for the United Railroads to profit
by this lesson. Let that corporation get in line with the aspiration
of the people and stay on good terms with San Francisco by giving
the people full satisfaction for the rights and privileges they have
bestowed upon it. Above all, able men as they are should not utter
vain knowledge and fill their bellies with the east wind, as they
do when they insist that there are impassable physical obstacles to
an underground 'system in the geology and topography of San
Francisco. The Clay, Sutter, Sacramento, Market, California street
and many other of their lines are now operated by cable. It is an
underground conduit system. Wherever it can be installed an un
derground trolley is as easy. Of this there is no doubt. Its opera
tion is as easy and as economical. There is no sorcery required to
put an underground trolley wherever there is an underground cable.
The company says that it desires to standardize its system,
which means a common gauge, curvature and motor. The under
ground only can standardize it. Therefore let us have peace, by
the United Railroads accommodating its policy to the wishes of
the people, and to the best interests of San Francisco, for it will
not be permitted to do anything else.
PROGRESSIVE SAN JOSE.
SAN JOSE is the beautiful center of a beautiful and fertile re
gion. It has become one of the show towns and resorts of the
State. Near on one hand it has Stanford University, and. on
the other Mount Hamilton Observatory. Not far away is* the State
redwood park and nearer the great orchards and seed farms that
make Santa Clara County famous.
San Jose now appreciates the fact that she must live up to her,
reputation and so proposes a bond issue for parks, sewers and school
houses. They are all good. In Alum Rock Park, which is to be im
proved, that city has a scenic asset that is worth millions to her fu
ture. It is proposed to spend on it $100,000 for baths, beautiful stone
bridges and roads and paths. That expenditure will be worth five
times its cost. The sewer system of the city and its school buildings
are to be benefited by the same issue.
In all this San Jose is wise in time. She sees her opportunity
and invites it in. Being now upon an overland line that city gets
first chop at travel, and does not have to wait for other places to
take first pick and choice.
A California city, to be up to date and to fulfill the expectations
of visitors, must not be content to show its trade balance only, and
Jts tributary acres of orchard and vineyard. San Jose can show
all these things and justly claim that in her materialities she far ex
ceeds any Eastern city of like population. Her fame- as the capital
of the widely known Santa Xlara Valley has gone far abroad. It
attracts enterprise and investment. But men do not live by bread
alone, and when they come to California they expect something
more. They want to see an expression of our climatic asset in some
thing besides fields and orchards. They will get it in the future in
San Jose if her people are wise. They will see there a. beautiful
all the year round park, in Which nature has been assisted by art.
until it blooms in January and July alike. They will find a city that
in. its streets, public buildings, sanitation and scenery rises high
above Eastern towns of many times its population. .
There is wealth and wisdom in the proposed policy of San Jose,
and we are sure that her enterprising; and appreciative people- will
rise to their opportunity and enter into the estate which nature in-

tice by the Men's Club of the Central Presbyterian Church. An ef
fort is being made , to . extend the good results attained by : forming
a chain of men's clubs recruited 'from every Protestant church, in
the city; and this plan connects itself with the greater task that is
now being undertaken of the unification of aIK the 'Protestant
churches for' work among the young people discharged from the
Children's Court. ' S : ,
The paper is an evidence that the Protestants have learned a
lesson in the power of unity from the work on these lines. by the
Jewish and the Catholic communities.. These religious organiza
tions, through their associated charities, ,keep track of /the children
placed under probation. The name and address of every child; con
victed of a delinquency is sent to priest or rabbi,' and although
these men are overcrowded with the work, , they have managed "to
tide many a boy overthe critical moment when his natural tendency
was to react violently^ from discipline I* * * and relapse into
'the evil ways that firstjbrought him into court." : Protestants. being
divided : into a hundred sects found it ; hard to work together and to
fix the responsibility, f or v any particular child. . The enthusiastic
young: minister who' interviewed fifty : Protestant pastors and scores
of Protestant laymen in the 'interest of this .work was -v informed
of the above difficulty. "Very well, then," he said; "if it is necessary^
to unify the churches to do this work, we will unify them."
The method 1 of the men's club plan is that the leader of each
branch assigns an -individual member! to look after each boy, wliose
name he receives. This provides a man for each boy; and gives
to: each corrected youth a special friend and adviser to hejp;hini
stay permanently corrected. The tactful method of approach -that is
advocated is; to try to; really be accepted by the ' boy' as' a friendâ
hot so' much to) lecture, preach and reproach, as, to be; a good^friend
and comrade, and to give the boy the; benefit /of the man's wider,

Some Advice
for Husbands
ANGELA MORGAN
A WIFE asks me to discuss that ever
old, ever new, question, how to re
vive the interest of a husband who
has .settled into that prosaic state which
means blight to the ethereal side oi love.
"Aiy husband has fallen Into that prac
tical, deadening 'caught the car' attitude
which so many women find they must
submit to after marriage, and which
takes so much from the real happiness
and " blessedness of life. Of course, he
thinks I am unreasonable to complain. He
says the most substantial proof of love
a man can offer hi* wife is to provide
well for her. But I am not happy. He
neglects so many of the little attentionsâ
and ours is not the companionship I
dreamed it would "be."
No doubt there are many practical,
"sensible" people who will disagree with
me when I say I sympathize heartily
with the writer.
I think it is "the most natural thing in
the world that a wife should resent tne
fact that her husband, because he is
"sure" of, her love, fails to take the
trouble to keep It.
A great deal is said about the necessity
of woman's making efforts to keep a
man's love after she has won it- Quite as
many arguments might be advanced to
show how great is the necessity of man 3
exerting himself to keep alive the high
affection h e has kindled in a woman 3
S Â°Unfortunately. man's activities have
compelled him to live so completely tne
objective life, the surface life, that his
ideals-even his ideals of love-are ex
ceedingly material as compared with wo
"fIot men. if any. have the slightset
conception of the mental suffering wo
men endure as a result of mans failure
to recognize the needs of love's spiritual
SJ The average man takes the purely ob
jective view of love and does not concern
himself with the subjective. ."i et i : is in
the subjective ,a woman s love has its
nouri3hment. When Jove is
merely on the material side; when its
finer wants are Ignored, it suffers as a
plant would suffer whose roots were ne o 
le Lovehas a two-fold environment-the
physical and the spiritual. The needs of
the spiritual are quite as l=â¢ cratlv Â« a *
those of the physical. Woman is more
keenly- conscious of this than man. and
when that side of her nature is staged
life for her loses Its magic. She settles
into the humdrum against her will, bit
terly flshtinc against the seeming mcv-
I do not think any trife 'should be ridi
culed or rebuked for resenting an attitude
on hsr husband's part which Implies in
difference to her finest, highest needs*.
The ethereal, the magical, is not too
good for every day. and this Is true in
love perhaps more than In anything else.
Life, being two-fold, must partake ot
two-fold nourishment to be complete.
I was asked to give advice to wives,
but am turning thl3 article rather Into a
talk to husbands. This Is because I think
the remedy lies more with the men than
with the women.
Husbands, do not ridicule or rebuke your
wives when they demand that the ethe
real side of love have recognition.
The srreatest mistake you can make Is
to expect a woman to be content merely
with the "substantial practical proofs" of
love. ,
Be willing to forget your side anfl look
at the woman's side. You have small con
ception of the terrible lack she feels when
the higher, finer side of love is slighted.
Don't ridicule. Don't turn a deaf ear.
Help your wives to keep alive the ideal
and the beautiful in love.
Lost in a London Fog.
As he went down the narrow staircase,
covered with its dingy and, threadbare
carpet, he found the house so full of
dirty yellow haze that he realized that
the fog must be of the extraordinary ones
which are remembered in after years aa
abnormal specimens of their kind. He re
called that there had been one of the sort
three years before, and that traffic and
business had been almost entirely stopped
by it, that acefdents had happened in the
streets, and that people having lost their
way had wandered about turning corners
until they found themselves far from their
intended destinations and obliged to take
refuge in hotels or the houses of hospita
ble strangers. Curious incidents had oc
curred and odd stories were told by those
who had felt themselves obliged by cir
cumstances to go out Into the baffling
gloom. -He guessed that something of a
like nature had fallen upon the town
again.' The gaslight on the landings and
in the melancholy hall burned feeblyâ so
feebry that one got but a vague view of
the rickety hatstand and the shabby over
coats and headgear banging upon It. It
was well for him that he had but a cor
ner or so to .turn before he reached the
payshop In whose window he had seen
the pistol he intended to buy.
When he opened the street door he saw
that the fog was, Upon the whole per
haps, even heavier and more obscuring,
if possible, than the one so well remem
bered. He could not see anything three
feet before him. he could not see with
distinctness anything two feet ahead. Tne
sensation of stepping forward was un
certain and mysterious enough to be al
most appalling. A man not sufficiently
cautious might have fallen into any open
hole in his path. Antony - Dart kept
as. closely as possible to the sides of the
houses. It would \u25a0 have been easy to
walk off the pavement into the middle of
the street but for the edges of the curb
and the steu downward from Its level.
Traffic had almost absolutely ceased,
though in the more Important streets
link-boys were making efforts to guide
men or four-wheelers slowly along. The
blind feeling of the thing was rather
awfulâ From "The Dawn of a To-Mor

AND SOME OTHER BOOKS
"THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN" Is
another conquest In the literary field
that goes to the credit of Booth Tark
ington. the gentleman from Indiana,
and it is generally considered to be
the host work he has yet accomplished.
Tbe^r.ame is likely to suggest the tale
of a victory of the Israelites over the
heathen in the times of the Old Testa
ment; but while not that, it is Indeed
a conquest by those who worship and
serve the God cf kindness and honor
over the pagans of this present age
who serve the gods of selfishness and
prejudice. The story had a run in
Harper's Magazine, and is now issued
in book form and well illustrated by
Lucius W. Hitchcock.
Tarkington's work deserve* consider
able attention, for he is. not only al
ready of much note, but he is still an
\;nknovrn quantity in fiction â with the
i. of it looking like a prophecy of con
stantly Increasing' excellence. He keeps
coming, and coming with bettered work
every time he comes. As he is still a
comparatively young man. and the
spirit of his work snows both in and
between the lines that he is moved by
high ideals, his career will be well
worth watching. His last work is a
study of the middle-class American
life in a country town, and he is such
m success In tliat line of life elucida
tion it may be eonlidently expected
that he can, if he will, make his work
Cletinctively American.
Tarkington now has six successful
books to -is crÂ«-dit. His first decided
success, "The Gentleman from Indiana,"
\u25a0was begun in 18S4, but work on it was
interrupted by the writing of short
stories and plays. When it was fin
ished he was so diffident about sub
mitting it to a publisher he kept it
locked up in his desk for a long time.
It was published in book form in 1833
and was an immediate success. Next
he wrott the "Monsieur Beaucaire"
Mhicb. is such a great favorite at our
San Francisco libraries. Subsequently
this \u25a0was dramatized by the author, and
it was played by Richard MansJield in
America and by Louis Waller In Eng
land with great success.
Then came "The Two Vanrevels" and
next the novelette "Cherry." An in
ttresting bit of gossip about "Cherry"
Is that Booth Tarkington adds to his
\ersatility by being an artist of con
siderable skill, and the Harpers printed
for him a small private edition of ,
>"herry" which is illustrated with tije
tuthor's own pen and ink sketches.
Then came "The Beautiful Lady," that
to excellently beautiful thing of almost
ir.adly eloquent sentiment that I am
Joth to set it down that the "Conquest
of Canaan" can possibly be better than
that delicious nov^iette.
There was a. volume of short stories,
called "la the Arena," and now comes
the "Conquest of Canaan" -with a wo
man in it who might well conquer any
;.ppreciative town or the heart of any
man who was on cuest of the golden
girl. It was not the man in the case
but really she who accomplished the
conquest of Canaan, for the man, albeit
a manly and a very fine fellow, was
nevertheless 'so exceedingly close to
falling down in his manhood that ho
certa.ir.ly \u25a0would have done so if the
girls regard for his better self had
not heUI him up. Inspired by the
thought of her friendship he fought
again and conquered.
This heroine. Ariel, will no doubt
conquer the hearts of multitudes of
readers all over the country. It Is hard
to say which of these two fine natures
is most finely drawn, the man or the
woman, but certainly every reader of
the book will be breathlessly eager that
these two shall be happily drawn to
gether before the author compels us to
bid them farewell.
The story illustrates of what strenuous
heroism must be he who has to contend
c gainst the fate of being the dog who Is
fiven a bad name. Joe Louden was both
that he and that hero. Practically he
â¢was run out of town by the prejudices
end the unkindness and stupidity of
the people of Canaan. Years after,
â¢irged on by the love of a woman and
by the pride of mastery over misfor
tune, he returned, and, although slight
ed, snubbed and hissed, and persistently
misrepresented, he lived down all the
enmity and made himself the most
masterful â rightly masterful â man in
his native town, and he did this chiefly
by befriending the downfallen and the
friendless. The quiet, persistently
powerful, unostentatiously courageous
tray in which he did this it is the
book's art to make us imagine in
carnated.
In one scene, far toward the close of the
r.ovel, in the chapter simply called
"Joe Walks Across the Yard," this con-
C'Jtror of his fate is portrayed as act
ing out that peculiar quality of courage
which made him victor in that inci
dent as also In his whole career. It is
r.n epitome of his life, and reveals the
essence of his manhood. It is the heart
cf the book. In the final pages of the
book a much admired minister is repre
sented as preaching a sermon in which
he describes and commends Just that
kind of courage, which the reader, look
ing backward, will realize is the quan
tity and the quality of it with which
the conqueror of Canaan won his vic
tory.
To quote the only extract given from
that sermon will be perhaps to give the
story best justice, and it will be mostly
justly considerate of those who have
no means to buy the book or time to
tead it through. First let me give you
an impression of the scene surrounding
the â¢voice which we are to imagine urg
ing from a holy place the common
sense wisdom upon our memories. Tark
ington. like all good artists, is excel
lent in the skill with which he puts be
fore us the importance of the place and
time which it is well for the eye to
imagine:
'â¢Joe took his place in Ariel's pew be
side her. For him there was only the
prtsence of divinity; the church was
filled with it.
. "They rose to sing:
Ancient of davji who *titÂ«t throned in glory.
To thee all knees are bent, all voice* pray;
Tfcy lov* hast blest the wide world's wondrous
story, '
With ilyht and life eince Eden's dawning day.
"The sun, so eager without, came
temperately through the windows, ,
where stood angrels and saints in gen- ;
tie colors, and the face of the young
minister in this quiet light was like
the faces in the windows.
" 'Not only to confront your enemies,
hÂ«? said; that is not enough; nor is It
that I would have you bluster at them, |
nor take arms against them: you will |
not have to do that If. when .they
come at you you do not turn one inch
aside, but with an assured heart, with
good nature, not noisily, and with
steadfastness you keep on your way.
If you can do that I say that they will
turn asidÂ« for you and you shall walk
.straight through them and only laugh
kw be left of. their anger.'"
1 As for the description wherein Lou-
proves that he is possessed of that
type of courage to a degree that made
it powerful, it is one wherein our au
thor is evidently taking- delight In his
-work. You might fancy the smile that
j played across his face when the
I thought of the caption, "Joe Walks
j Across the Yard." That was all Joe
did, just simply walked across the
yard, but the glory of it was that a
whole excited mob of abusive and ma
lignant men wanted to prevent him
walking across the yard, and
each one of them as he came face to
face with the concueror of Canaan
turned coward, hesitated and dared not
hinder that quiet, smiling, "walking
across the yard. The mob were cry
ing, "Tar and feather him! Take him
over to the river- and throw him in."
But no one of the mob wanted to be
the first to touch him.
The Item that gives richness to the
little story is that the first man who
was apparently about to tear Joseph

leader's cowardice and prudence, made
way for Joe. but bellowed. "Head him

one dared head him off the spectators
on the street caught on to the ludi
crousness of the situation and over
whelmed Loudens enemies with
laughter.
"The laughter increased. It became
voluminous. Homeric salvos shook the
air. And never one of the fire eaters
upon the steps lived long enough to
lire down the hateful cry of that day,
'Head him off!' which was to become
a catch word on the streets, a taunt
more stinging than any devised by de
liberate invention, an Insult bitterer
than the ancestral doubt, a fighting
word, and the great historical joke of
Canaan, never omitted in after days
when the tale was told how Joe Lou

Courthouse yard which made him
Mayor of Canaan."

HISTORY OF NATIONS
OF THE EARTH.
The twelfth volume of the "History
of All Nations." edited by John Henry
Wright of Harvard University, is out.
This volume. XIL is devoted to the
subject of "The Religious Wars," and
is written by Martin Philippson, who
vras formerly professor of history in
the universities of Bonn and Brussels.
The volume covers the period of the
counter reformation in Central and
Eastern Europe (A. D. 1556-1618) and
the period of the thirty years' .war
(A. D. lâ¬is-IC4S). It is abundantly il
lustrated with reproductions of old
fashioned portraits and pictures anÂ»l
with fac-simllesof old documents of
historic importance.
It is a strange experience V> take a
glance back at these old acrimonious
religious contentions and bloody wars.
Try to imagine how you would feel
this morning If you knew you were
liable to be butchered or burned ".ilivw
if your religious opinion happened to
differ with those of the party in power.
It would probably have the villainous
effect of making most of the popula
tion either deliberate liars or else care
ful concealers of what they really
thought. The bold and truthful men
would be the most likely to be elimin
ated. It would be an evolution back
ward. To some extent' this is what
really happened in the sixteenth cen
tury.
This history says that the progress
Of Germany at the beginning of this
period seemed to owe its vigor to the
great religious reformation; but be
cause of a mixture of influence from
the powers in control the old faith of
fered resistance, and there was con
tention that crippled the energies of
the nation. The reformers had to seek
the aid of princely protectors. Then
Protestantism became divided within
itself. Calvirtists and Lutherans dif
fered and contended, and that, too on
such merely secondary points that' the
antagonisms produced a petty, narrow
character, debasing and weakening in
stead of ennobling the heart and mind
"The mighty reform movement was
followed by a time of lamentable de
cadence â a deterioration of the Ger
man character such as no other epoch
has seen."
After the death of Luther these
wrangles seem to^ have degenerated into
the absurd. One Andreas Oslander, a pro
fessor of theology in the University of Ko
nigfberg, originated one of these rows by
explaining that justification was less a
divine act of grace than "the imparting
of an Inner righteousness through "a
mystic union of . the eoul with Christ."
Most people nowadays would be. willing to
draw straws for either end of that dilem
ma, .and taking the one that came, say,
"let it go at that," because It was prob
ably as close as theology could get at
the truth. However, such easy going
tolerance was not for those bickering
days. "Both sides fought with written
and- oral arguments, in which, according
to the coarse ; fashion of the day, â¢ the
devil and'bell played an Important part.
The Protestant population 1 , were I excited

and greatly perplexed, no one feeling
quite 'sure of what was divine and what
diabolical, or whether he belonged to the
righteous or the damned."
A curious instance of superstltutlon Is
given In speaking of the character of the
great warrior, Wallensteln. "â¢ â¢ He
took the renowned astronomer, Kepler,
Into his pay only to have him cast the
nativities of all persons with whom he
came in contact." It is not so much to
make you wonder about Wallenstein that
I quote this; It's concerning Kepler that
I expect you to roll your eyes astronomic
ally high up and murmur "mlrabTle
dictu!" Was it not Kepler who was wont
to account for his extraordinary wisdom
by saying, "I think God's thoughts after
him," and po give us the impression that
he was half inspired? Now, by the Apostle
Paul, or rather let us say, by the great
Count Cagllostro, who could have imag
ined the immortal Kepler drawing down
a fat salary for that sort of a. service?
However, that's the truth of history; and
â"Let justice be done, though the
heavens fall!" Kepler can calculate the
square of the distance.
Perhaps the most Interesting chapter in
this volume is the one giving an account
of the government of Richelieu. Probably
the best summing up ever given of the
brilliant career of that astute French
statesman and heartily disliked boss ol
King Louis XIII '|s in the words of
Madame de . Mottevllle, namely, that he
had out of his master made a slave,' and
out of this slave the greatest king in the
world." If Madame de- Motteville ever
uttered any better mot . than' that we
would much relish comfng across it in
our reading. . â¢
There are some interesting pages
about the literature of that age. We
are told of the remarkable Influence
the philosopher Descartes had on the
development of the French language.
"He gave to it clearness, 'the exact
designation of each Idea by a 1a 1 word
expressly and forever assigned to It,
qualities by which the French writers
of the epoch immediately following dis
tinguished themselves."
If ' some Descartes had from the be
ginning made it clear to all men just
exactly what words mean, then perad
venture we would have much less vol
uminous histories of religious wars;
for doubtless most of these theological
contentions, oral, written, â¢ or with
sword and cannon, are wars because of
the indeflnJ-teness of words.; Consider
that big Osiander-origlnated row of which
I quoted you the '^errible result. ; The
fight was about whether justification
was "less a divine act of grace than
the imparting of an inner righteous
ness through a mystic, union of the
soul with Christ." '\ In those old days
of the religious wars unless you could
settle, that quandary you could not tell
whether you "belonged to the righteous
or the damned." Those religious wars
lasted seventy-four years. All this was
ended by the peace of , Westphalia.
Professor Phlllppson says near -the
close of his history: "At the price of
its best blood. Its unity,; its .well-being,
its Independence -arid greatness," the
oerman people, 'by the Thirty/ Years';

work, and the one recent'volume contains
the contributions of 137 v - scholars. It is
quite a large volume, containing 790 pages
and 306 illustrations.
"Gaul of Tarsus (known as Paul, the
apostle of the heathen)" makes the sub
ject of one of the most notable articles
in the present number. It covers about
seventeen columns of closely printed mat
ter, which la a. very unusual quantity of
space for this encyclopedia to devote to
one caption. To behold what sort of a
figure the great apostle of the Gentiles
presents to the eyes of Jewish schol
arship will probably make the most
widely interesting glimpse that I can give
In fragment from this Jewish tome.
It will be well remembered that.not
alone by orthodox Christians Is Paul ex
tolled. Matthew Arnold, one of . the big
gest Intellectual guna that ever expended
splendid literary ammunition upon what
free-thinkers consider the absurdities of
dogma, praised Saint Paul B o highly that
any other agnostic examining Arnold's
estimate of Saul must needs be astonished
at the admiration the satirical author of
"Literature and. Dogma" throws like
wreaths at the feet of the eloquent apos
tle. The modern Jewish scholar who
makes this study sees in Paul much to
admire, but more .to adversely criticize.
The. serious consideration given to him by
this encyclopedia, as well as that admira
tion of the unorthodox Matthew Arnold,
evidence the great import of the man to
even th6se who disallow his beliefs.
; In the firÃt paragraph we are told that
the epistles ascribed, to Paul have been
proved by critics to be" 1 partly spurious
(Galatians. Ephesians, I and II Timothy,
Titus, and others), and partly Interpolated.
This is a very hard blow, for no doubt
there are many, people, who admire St.
Paul for his wonderful command- of
language, , as as^de from or added ; to
his ardent faith. If the whole; world
should come to believe his' - theo
logical teachings to be but the su
persubtleties of a brilliant' epileptic
ecstatic, we would still wish to keep the
eloquent apostle upon our book shelves In
order to marvel at and'enjoy the wonder
ful way that j religious enthusiast could
condensedly and tropically write,' Now
If these mentioned modern j critics % are
correct even his } literary \ value is littled.
Unless we ' are erudite -scholars \u25a0we can
never be sure whether we are reading the
words of one who :, had been ; uplifted to
an .'extraordinary exaltation of thought
and language; by; a vision of divinity, or
whether we are learning by heart some
spurious or interpolated \ sentence, done
by some scheming rectifier of. theological
discrepancies. -;-.- * _\u25a0 . â¢
t- St., Paul Is set down In -this -article
as "the actual â¢founder, of the Christian
church ; as J opposed : toY? Judaism." ,, : >. This
is ' of ScoursÂ© equivalent to ; saying that
the teaching of Jesus^ was not opposed
to Judaism as Is the Christian! church.
Another : notable assertion is . that j Paul
was not a Hebrew scholar,' and that he
\u25a0was distinctly; Hellenic; in ; thought and
sentiment rather than { Hebraic, o This
sounds astonishing; when we | remember
that Paul seemsto.summon the almost

language; to assure ius he was ; an abso

version i and show "nb; familiarity with'

ture came his theological and eschat-
ological- system, and the epistles' that
I bear his name are said to prove him
the Hellenist in thought. It is admit
ted that he was of Jewish parentage;
but the rabbinical training ascribed to
him is denied. â¢ .
That celebrated terrible "thorn in
the flesh" of which Paul complained Is
here described as having been epilepsy.
To this physical condition is ascribed
what is called Paul's pessimism. Now
here Is a view of Paul that shows him
as Jewish thought sees him and op
poses him. ,
"For Judaism,, religion is the hallow
ing of this life by the fulfillment of Its
manifold duties: Â£aul shrank from life
as the domain of Satan and all his
hosts of evil; he longed for redemption
by the deadening of all desires for life, \
and strove for another world which he
saw in his ecstatic visions."
That quotation will remind one of
Paul's peculiar views on the subject -of
marriage â that the wedded state is
something distinctly below the high
ideal of absolute chastity in celibacy,
and that marriage Is a sort of allowed
license to save helpless people who
otherwise would be victims of Satan's
temptation. Many | devout Christians
will admit that the Jewish view of the
wedded condition is some prettier and
much more romantic than St. Paul's
"better.to marry than to burn" theory
of the love bond. .
, Another Jewish view is that in re
%ard to baptism St. Paul changed the
Jewish and Judaeo.-Chrlstlan Idea of
its being a symbolic rite - suggestive
of purification to an assertion â¢of its
being a mystic rite effecting an ac
tual transformation as the baptized I
emerged from the water. Again, ob
jection Is made to his teaching that
the I Christ's death" on the cross was a
cosmic act "by which God becomes
reconciled to . himself." The encyclo
pedist says: "To a Jewish mind, trained 1
by rabbinical acumen, this Is not pure
monotheistic but mythological think
ing." : ';" \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0^:- "\u25a0 , ' -.-'-'â¢ ' .\u25a0.'.-
Note this characteristic of Jewish
thought; it is under the subhead of an
tlnomlanism,and Jew hatred: "Paul ar
gues that the saving grace of God lies In
faith (that is, in blind belief), and â¢ not In
the works of .the law." And for another 1
this: "Paul construed; a system of faith 1

despite the world, for they shall be
pleasing to God. Blessed be the souls
and bodies of virgins. . for they shall
receive the reward of their chastity.**
The Jewish commentator adds to that
this: It was by such preaching that "he
ensnared the souls of young men and
maidens, enjoining them to remain sin
gle.". This little glance at the great Jew
ish Encyclopedia is a gentle reminder of
how encyclopedic Is this world of "many

frequently recurring things that recall
how very variously artists and thinkers

NEW NOVEL FROM
PEN OF CRAWFORD
The subtitle of F. Marion Crawford's
new novel, "Fair Margaret," is "A" Por
trait," and by that we are made to know
I that, the principal intent of the work Is
to picture the character of the fair young
I woman whose history in the volume of
1 3SO pages is hardly more than just begun.
It Is Intimated in the closing sentence
that her story is to be continued in other
part or parts. It is to be a study of an
artistic temperament and of an operatic
career; but so far the- story has not
taken us beyond the girlhood of the
prospective great actress, and we are
made to take leave of her on the very
night of her splendidly successful debut.
Although she Is to be the portrait, there
are three others so skillfully drawn by
this practiced author it would have been
quite appropriate for him to make the
subtitle "Portraits" had he not wished to
emphasize that fair Margaret was super
latively the object of his artistic work.
So far she is a girl whom a reader may
like fairly well without being forced by
the power of the fiction to quite fall in
love with her. Whether Mr. Crawford
intends to gradually draw us on and in- j
crease our liking until it becomes a pas
sionate devotion ia one <v the conjectures
with which we close the book. It
will be remembered that Anthony
Hope recently gave us a study on the
same line and that the actress whom he
made us admire in the first part of ber
history he caused us, before the close of
his book, to half-disdain as a mere sales
woman of her own emotions, which were
good for stage uses, but not of the true
gold ring in real life. Marion Crawford's
portrait promises a different conclusion
from that of Hope's "Servant of the Pub
lic," as fair Margaret seems of much
finer clay and is represented as being a
lady by birth.
Not as remarkably beautiful Is this fair
Margaret pictured to us by the author;
but in taking stock of her advantages
"she rather liked* her own face." "It
was a satisfactory face, on the whole,
she thought, perfectly natural and frank
and healthy. â¢ â¢ â¢ It was easy to be
satisfied with what she had in the way
of looks, and not to envy the insolent
radiance of the fair beauties or the tragic
splendors of the dark ones. Besides,
beauty has great disadvantages; it at
tracts attention' at the wrong moment
â¢\u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ â¢ and hinders a woman from doing
exactly what she pleases." As for her
self, she had brown hair and brown eyes,
a complexion of cream tinged with peach
bloom, and she knew her good points and
realized that some day she might have to
make the most of them; they were her
mouth, her complexion and her figure.
A little further along in life she dis
covers she has another asset, and an enor
mously valuable one, namely, a voice fit
for a star In grand opera. Splendidly
is the description given of the way that
discovery burst â¢ upon the ambitious but
doubting young woman. She has to urge
her way to the stage through strong op
position, for the woman friend with whom
she had lived since she was left an or
phan in early childhood was bitterly prej
udiced against the profession of actress,
and the two men who loved Margaret
were also bent on withholding her from
that career. As she Is not sure of the
possession of a fortune In her own right
she persists In preparing herself to earn
her living, and ,slnging beins her only
accomplishment she develops It by study
ing in Paris until an old but still power-^
fully reigning prima donna recognizes
the perfection of Margaret's voice and
secures for her a successful debut.
â¢ This prima donna, Madame Bonanni. is
quite a strongly drawn portrait to be set
beside Margaret's. So far, if anything,
she seems more lifelike than the heroine.
She is a woman peasant-born, but made
imperious in a way by her talent and
the power than came as result of it.
She is one "about whom dreadful stories
are told." but she takes such a warm
hearted Interest In saving Margaret from
nefarious plots that no one can feel
toward her as If she were essentially
evil. When Margaret first decides to
visit her at her house and ask an opinion
of the value of her voice she did It with
the idea she could for that purpose sep
arate the artist from. the 'woman and so
justify the personal contact with her. As
the story develops a discovery Is made
by Margaret about Madame Bonanni
which draws the old prima donna Into
close relations with her life of love as
well as her life of art.
The two men who are rivals for the
heart of Margaret are very distinctively
portrayed characters also. One of them is
j Lushington. a successful young writer and
critic. He is very sensitive and easily em
barrassed and provoked. He seems quite
a strange mingling of conceit and mod
esty. He claims to be a realist. Margaret
Is an Idealist. Although deep under the
i surface the two love each other. It Is
1 a difficult approach for both through mu
tual misunderstandings. Though Mar
garet cares for him" very much it is not
to be assumed from .that she in- 1
tends to marry him-. 1 It Is not
by any means sure even that he Is
going to propose' marriage to her. There
is some x family dishonor of which he Is
' ashamed, though not his fault, which
i holds' him back f rom : offering himself.
I These ' two a quarrel j and j criticize each
i other quite to the point of rudeness, but
still they never become completely es
tranged. Lushington has a deep-seated
dislike of the stage as a career for a lady, j
and especially, for the one he loves. |
\u25a0 â¢ The other lover, Cons tan tine Logotbeti. {
jls an Immensely wealthy Greek, middle I
aged and, of artistic temperament. He is:Â«
represented as a .; thoroughbred Oriental |
gentleman of Constantinople by birth and I
breeding, but whose standards of gentility
did not deny him the permission of his
own will to : ca*pture x . a woman by strata
gem and make her bis by, force. He came
of a race which, "though being temporari
ly isolated from modern progress, has not '
grown \u25a0 old with It." \ Margaret does j not {
love him. but because of his talents., his |
great wealth .and hl3 * social recognition â¢
i she is pleased with his attention and plays
.with his passion. She is* frank and genu
ine "enough, however, to tell him all
through' the progress of the flirtation that
she will ~ not . marry; him.
_- Acceptance- of ; the -attentions of this
"wealthy Greek leads Ito Margaret having
some exciting adventures. In one case
she went voluntarily to his house and.
asking to speak with him alone, was
ushered into an apartment which was en
tered through double consecutive doors
and each thickly padded so that no sound
could be heard through them. She only
saved herself in that adventure by plead
ing to the Greek to remember his mother.
It is a finely "described scene and gave
Crawford fine opportunity for hia literary
skill; but one cannot escape the Impres
sion that there was some literary forcing
of a situation and an opportunity to get
a sensible and good girl like fair Mar
garet into such a predicament, where he
could magnificently describe her magnifi
cent extrication of herself from a danger
no prudent woman would have gone Into.
It will fee remembered that the virtuous
heroine In Mrs. Thurston's "The Gam
bler" la made to do that same sort of an
absurdly risky thins: and it is perhaps
the only serious blemish in that tine story.
We know that in real life such women as
these are described would be- too wise
and too wary to be so caught.
Logothetl loved the fair Margaret and
his love for her made him wish to keep
her from going on the stage. It is an in
teresting account Crawford gives of the
feelings of this Oriental lover about this
matter. After Margaret had resolved to
become an actress she. as an artistic
possession, "was as desirable as ever in
Logothetl's eyes: but she was no longer
at all desirable as a wife. The Greek.
in spite of the lawless strain in him, was
ah aristocrat tn the marrow of his very
solid bones. â¢ â¢ â¢ a man who revolted
at the thought of marrying a woman who
could show herself upon the stage, and
for money, who could stag for money,
and for the applause of a couple of thou
sand people, nine-tenths of whom he
would never allow to enter his house.
â¢ â¢ â¢ It is not in the nature of Orientals
to let their wives exhibit themselves to
the public."
A picture in the new novel shows xxa
the fair Margaret as she appeared In
male attire when, at her debut, she was
playing in Rlsoletto. To see her thus
spoiled her for wlfehood according to the
standards of her wealthy Greek lover.
But it was when she waa in that garb
that Lushington. who was himself the son
of an opera singer, pressed the new
actress' hand to his lips just after ha had ,
assisted In saving her rrom being kid
naped. "She held her head high and a
little thrown back, and there was some
thing wild and almost fantastic about
her looks as she stood there. â¢ â¢ â¢ She
held out her whitened hand to him: and
when ha took it he felt the chalk on It.
and it was no longer to him the band of
Margaret Donne, but the hand of Cor
dova, the great soprano."

The departure yesterday afternoon of
the liner Doric for the Orient was de

ready. Instead of sailing at 1 p. m.

stream by the Pacific Mail tug Arab. .
The majority of the Doric's passen
gers were for Manila. She carried a
full cargo, which included a heavy
shipment of machinery for Japan. She
also took a large .shipment of silver

freight clerk, remained ashore to await
ihe arrival of the Coptic, on which ves
sel he will relieve AY. C Chapman as
purser. Chapman goes to the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha. Morphy's promotion
follows years of efficient service with
the O." and O. Company and would have
come sooner had not the O. and O. licet
dwindled down to but two ships. \V.
H. Reid succeeds Morphy as freight
clerk on the Doric. The Doric also has
a new surgeon. Dr. Hauxhurst, who
toes to the Nippon Man;, has been suc

HERO OF SONG
FACES TROUBLE
Man Who Broke the Bank at
Monte Carlo Accused of
Trying Frenzied Finance
PLACED UNDER AEBEST
William Davenport Charged
With Running a Get-Eich-
Quick Scheme in^Englarid
Special Dispatch to The Cal!.
LONDON, Dec. 9.â William Davenport,
the hero, of that most popular, of ' uU
music hall songs, "The Man Who Broke
/the Bank at :Monte Carlo." has again
come before the ' public. Ile,Js charged
with swindling gullible Investors, r
It was something. like twenty years ago
that Davenport achieved the memorable
feat which all England and America sang
about. He was known then as Charles
Wells. Prior 'to -his appearance in Lon
don as the author of tin infallible gam
bling system he had been an engineer
and inventor In Paris and Marseilles.
So much money has been lost through
them* in recent years that people are now
rather chary about, backing folk who
profess to bo able to' beat the Monte
Carlo game, but Davenport had little
difficulty In persuading a sporting Ameri
can to finance him.' He "made, good," too.
In five, days he won J200.000 and did liter
ally break the bank on one occasion. Al
together . his at- Monte Carlo
netted him and | his backer 5317,500, of
which he pocketed $115,000 as his share.
The fact, however, that when he again
found ' himself hard up he tried to re
plenish his exchequer by methods which
have brought him before the bar of jus
tice seems to make it pretty clear that it
was no infallible system after all by
which he won'so heavily at Monte Carlo,
but simply a prodigious run of good luck.
If he really possessed an infallible sys
tem he would have â¢ had . recourse to It
again to make money in his old age. He
is now 86.
Associated with .him In his get-rich
quick enterprise was a bald-headed old
clergyman, the Rev. Vyvyan Henry
Moyle, whose plausible tongue and as
pect of venerable piety made him a val
uable ally. He Is charged with swind
ling, too.
Between them ' they organized the
South and Southwestern Steam Trawl
ing and Fishing Syndicate. Their fish
ing fleet consisted of a couple of un
seaworthy old steamships, which were
purchased for a few hundred dollars
apiece, and a few fishing nets. They
never caught any fish, it is alleged, but
they did catch a lot of credulous in
vestors. As an easy way of making
money, infallible schemes for breaking
the bank at Monte Carlo or schemes for
getting gold out of sea water did not
compare with their fishing business.
Annual profits of between JlOOO and
$1500 were promised on every $250 in
vested in the "syndicate." They had
obtained $25,000 only when the police
swooped down on them.
LAS LOMAS CHRISTMAS.â In order to re
plenish Its fund for the relief of sick members
Las Lomas Parlor of the Native Daughters of
the Golden West -has decided to give a Christ
mas tree party in the assembly ball of the
Pendo buildlnr. on Seventeenth street, near
Valencia, on the evening of December 15.

Hay and Feed stuff Â». ... . . ,
Bran and Shorts have "moved up 50c per ton

13 nothing new in Hay, of which the circular
of Scott &\u25a0 Manner ea?s: . . , \u25a0\u25a0..-.- â¢.. ;.; ,
"Arrivals , of Hay â¢ for the \u25a0 week just passed
have airfounted to 28W tons. ;. Arrivals by rail
read still continue exceedingly llghC There
appears to be no 'let up' : to the car stringency.
Information was obtained leading us to believe
that after the first of D<icember cars would be
\u25a0plentiful, but it appears to be as dlfacnlt to
obt&in a car at present as at any time during
the. fall. \u25a0- Th* b^UÂ» of axrivals. . therefore, con
tinue to come from the bay ahcrÂ» waiehj^aseai,
and consist almost whoQy of tbe poorer Classes
of Hay. While throughout the Interior {here
â¢appears -to-be, an active demand for. Hay to
feed stock, yet here in the city the current dÂ»
nianJ has been rather llfht. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Whfle there is
also considerable uneesiriess f*lt at Interior
points on account -of the lieht Vains. . yet here
it haa had -no etTect at all on market,condi
tions. Consignments durtng this week navp
not sold generally aa well as heretofore. Tile
feeling in the market la ; anything j bat strong-.
The poorer dassÂ«s of -Hay have found a Httle
better favor/ but the better erades have JyÂ«n
.somewhat easier. Conditions on Alfalfa Hay
are a little more settled. Arrivals have -been
more liberal, and the Immediate, demand has
been > supplied. The market Is steadier under
these eomUt kins. Straw continues along in

Deciduous and Citrus Fruit*.
With supplies plentiful and trade" of an ordi
nary njutia* character, the market for fresh
fruit* was devoid of especial- feature and weak
prices ruled for nearly everything on the list.
There, was a fair inquiry for high-grade Apples
and pxieeo for sgch stock were quite steady,
but there was very- little movement- in pewr
quality stock, which was In free supply. Top
quality lots of Bellfiowers in foor-tier pack
ages were firm at 51 40@l 50 per box. an 1
prices for similarly packed offerings of fine
Xewtown Pippins ranged from. 51 5O to f 1 75.
Fancy Spitzenbergs were still quoted at $1 75
per box, but there were few of that varUty
offering. Offerings of Grapes were liberal and
Included - much . carried-over siocS. which was
.hard to Â»e|l at any price. -'Strawberries met
with very. slow, sale at low and \u25a0 Irregular
. prices, the offerings being green and otherwise,
pqor. "in. the Citrus lino largs sizes' ef choios

. Late mail advices from XÂ«w York say:
"The distribution, of most of the staples
through the re?tilac channel* of . consumption
is on a large scale and the result of this ts
to force Jobbers whoee purchases for forward
delivery 'this year were much lighter- than
usual :to come into the market frequently.
They are not disposed to â¢ speculate, but con
fine their purchases to such quantities as ar*
needed to keep up assortments or supply, some
epecial want. \u25a0- The : most active article en the

CALIFORNIA FREIGHT
BUSINESS INCREASING.
Ta<M)ma to Make More Room
for San Francisco
Goods.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
TACOMA, Dec. 9.â Business between Ban
Francisco and Tacoma has grown to such
proportions that the San Francisco shed
on the water front has become Inade
quate for tha freight, and more space
will be added. When the Improvements
are made the quarters for , California
freight will practically be doubled." The
south end of the ocean warehouse has
been used as San Francisco shed space.
Milling v/as stored in the north end, which
is known as the bonded warehouse. After
the Northern Pacific built the new ware
house at the head of the bay most all
the milling was housed in It The former
bonded warehouse will now be used for
housing San Francisco cargo.
The Northern Pacific Railway haa an
nounced a new schedule of freight rates
between Tacoma and Portland on freight
destined to and from San Francisco.
Heretofore rates on through San Fran
cisco freight have been higher than on
local tonnage between . the Sound and
Portland. The steamship lines have been
cutting Into the freight traffic ' between
the Sound and San Francisco, carrying
some classes of freight that formerly
went by rail. This fact is believed to
have Influenced the railroad in promul
gating the new schedule. Reductions on
the San Francisco freight amount to 23
per cent and more. First-class freight Is
reduced from 45 to 80 cents a hundred
pounds.

TANBAKK INDUSTRY
Professor Jepson of State
University Makes Trip

WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â Professor Wil
lis I* Jepson of.the University of Cali
fornia, a collaborator with the forest ser
vice, is now in Europe, where. In connec
tion with university work, he is devoting
special attention to a study of the tan
bark Industry In European countries for
the purpose of obtainingra broader view
of the . tannin* Industry of the Pacific
Coast, which the. forest service Is Inves
tigating- A chief point in .his study
abroad ; wlllbe tha effort to determine the
value and sources ; of the tanning mate
rials which Pacific Coast tanners derive
by importation from . European source's.
Not only will statistics be gathered, but
a. comparison will be made of the quali
ties of leather obtained from domestic and
Imported tanning extracts, wHb a. view, to
finding and recommending for use, on the
Pacific Coast the' best methods of tan
bark production, ; and especially of exten
sion and maintenance i of" present re
sources, In order .that the home, supply
of bark may be so conservatively used
as to make importation unnecessary.
The tanbark oak of the Pacific | Coast,
which is pre-eminently the best American
source of tanning material, has been; so
severely cut that despite Its ; wide distri
bution and Its once plentiful supply there
is increasing danger of its early exhaus
tion. ..\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0"--:. f>;TS"&'!*

MYSTERY IS EEVIVED
Unfortunate Believed; to iÃe
New Mexico Attorney Who
\u25a0 Has Long Been iLissihg
6BÂ«cial DisDatch to Tha Call.
i . BAPISPE, Sbnora, Mexico, Dec. 9.â A
demented American ; has, been seen by
several : mining prospectors wandering
In trie muun tains south' of 'hare. Ha is
scantily, dressed and I efforts to effect his
capture and bring him to j town nave so
tar ; proved - futile. . From, the descrip
tion that' is given of him it Is. believed
that he , Is Colonel Albert J. Fountain,
a | former - resident of Las | Cruces. N.; M.
Colonel v Fountain \ mysteriously/; disap-"
ipeared nine j years ago. He was at that
time Attorney: of the ;, Las
Cruces | district and it is ' said that he
made a hard nght upon the j bold cattle
thieves who infested that region,^caus
ing | the j leaders of the bands |of the
outlaws to be indicted and breaking up
their business. \u25a0 c ' "'
â¢ Colonel Fountain was on hlÂ» way
home j from' attending court in a remote
part; of his district and was accom
panied by, his son. They .vanished com
pletely ,in one night. It. was .believed
at the time that they, had been waylaid
and killed by members of the bands of
cattle thieves or their friends. ' .
; | It .was about four years ago that the
report was first circulated in the South
west and this part of Mexico that Col
onel | Fountain j had been seen . and , rec-,
ognized in a . remote settlement In ;the
heart of the Sierra Madres in the west
ern part :of ; the State â¢of - Chihuahua.'
Little credence was placed In; the re
port and it was forgotten until revived
a few weeks ago by Charles , Clump,' a
mmmg 'prospector. Clump returned to
'Las Cruces, N. M., from a prospecting
trip'- Into themountains of the State of
Sonora and ' told that he had met I Col
onel Fountain a.nd his son, Harry Foun
tain, In 1 a remote and almost inacces
sible locality in,the Sierra Madres. ; He
said .that the ; two Americans : had been
held captive by a band of Mexican out
laws all' these years; jthat they y were
carefully watohed and had i been un
able to make their escape. .According
to : Clump's story he managed to j have
a secret conversation | with, ; Colonel
Fountain and arranged a plan of escape
for the â¢ two captives. Clump says that
they tried to make their. escape accord-
Ing to the plan agreed upon: and that a
desperate fight took place, In which he
received a wound . in : his leg. ? > He ; got
away, however, but" he v never. learned
what became of Colonel Fountain and
his ion.'. y.UI
It is thought here that Clump's story
Is probably true and that Colonel Foun
tain made his escape from the outlaws
in that fight, but afterward became lost
in the mountains. The terrible; strain
under, which he may have labored , for
so many years, together with the hard
ships I and privations he may have en
countered after making his escape from
the band 1 of outlaws, are enough to
have unsettled his; mind,- It lsthought.
Further efforts are to be '% made . to
solve v the mystery, v? The t demented
who \u25a0 Is ; over â¢ these
mountains" will be captured If possible
and if he should'prove'to bethe long-^
missing Colonel Fountain he will be re
turned to his' old home In 'New. Mexico.
It is supposed - that the man ; is; subslst
lng;on mountain berries and meats of,
various nut trees. / " .". â¢' '\u25a0\u25a0[-':'\u25a0\u25a0

UNDER BAN
Sntter Street Must
Have a Modern
System,
Supervisors Recognize
People's Wish for
the Conduit.
One More Meeting Is Planned
in Hope That Agreement
Will Be Reached.
The Supervisors' Street
and Finance committees
yesterday voted unani
mously to reject the appli
cation of the United Rail
roads for permission to
change the motive power
of the Sutler-street line
from the cable to an over
head electric trolley sys
tem. The Supervisors rec
ognize the wishes of a
majority of the people
that an underground elec
tric conduit system be in
stalled.
The members of the Street and
I'inance committees of the Board of
6uperviÃorÂ« yesterday voted to deny the
application of the United Railroads for
<fv^ermisskm to either renovate the cable
'"//stem or to construct an overhead
trolley ; service. The result is the
unanimous decision of the committees,
to stand for the acknowledged, wish of
*> majority of the people for an under
ground conduit system on the thor
t ugrhfares traversed by \u25a0 the Sutter
ttreet line.
Jn addition to denying the applica
tion for permission to use antiquated
methods on the road in question the
committees instructed Secretary Fay to
i.otlfy the United Railroads of the de
cision and to ask it to join in a con
ference at which a representative com-
Mlttee of citizens will also be Invited
t-j be present. The meeting is to be
1-eld in the hope that the citizens and
tue railroad company may come to
fome understanding whereby the anti
cunted Sutter-street road may be re
modeled.
There is a Blight hope on the part
cf the Supervisors that the road may
i>ut in another proposition that will
concede something to the Wishes of the
people and that the representatives of
the people will meet the United Rail
roads fax If way. The date of the meet-
Ing Â£&s not yet been designated.
One by one the. various members of
the committee outlined their views on !
the acceptance or. rejection of the rail- j
road's proposition.' Several of -the com
mittee appeared to be personally in
/ifc-vor of the overhead trolley, carry-
V* ; '-Â«- with It the promise of the company
to furnish light along the thorough
fares over which the franchise extends.
They expressed this preference owing
to the urgent need of business advance- j
rnent and lack of transportation faclll- I
ties on Suiter street and because of J
the need immediately or a rapid tran- j
*U system. Their reaso^ however,
transit system. Their reason, however,
for voting against the proposition was
because 75 per cent of the people wiyi
the underground system. ;
MARKET STREET A PROBLEM..
Another reason why the board
reached Its decision to deny the appli
cation wee the Interjection by the
United Railroads of the * Market-street
transportation problem. The railroad
maintained that the overhead wire sys
tem was best, as it facilitated uniform I
transportation throughout the city. It j
then went on to propose overhead j
wires for Market street and on this the
Supervisors came down flat-footed. - j-
The argument advanced against the 1
railroad's plea for a uniform system of j
transportation was that such a system j
Is impossible in San Francisco. On j
some streets the cable will always re- jj
main because of the grades to be over- i â¢
come. It is not necessary that the i j
electric roads be operated entirely by!
â¢overhead trolleys or entirely under-! j
ground wires, as cars can.be equipped^
with attachments so that they may be \ j
operated on either of thet systems and j
ttae cars readily switched from one sys- ,
tern to, the other without loss of time
i The meeting was held, at 762 A. Har- ,

TSamuel Braunhart of the Street "Com- t
mittee. Braunhart, while slowly â¢ re- ,
gaining his health,- was unable to leave ,

The accident happened at the crossing

with his wire, his daughter ElJzabem;
his slater, Miss Lottie Ailardt. and a lady
friend wn ) had just arrived on a viait to
the family,' had started for a trip out iu
the Eastern suburban district. Allardt
says â¢ that he was running at speed not
more than ten nii.es an hour when he ap
proached the railroad crowing. The
train, consisting of a motor car and thro
gravel cars, was backing up the track in
the direction of Leona Heights. A3 all
the cars in the train were flat cars they
could not be seen above the fence at th*
side of the right of way, and hearing, as
he declares, neither cell nor whistle, tha
banker did not see the approaching dan
ger until hla attention was called to tha
train by a scream of terror from hi*
wife. The machine wu then fairly across
the tracks and â¢ the train was not ten
feet ; distant. . Before ; be . could make a
move to avert : the collision the crash
came. The end ofthÂ© first flat oar struck

machine; wai. pushed ahead of , the train,
bumping .over, the ties of the roadbed
until It overturned . in '\u25a0 the \u25a0 ditch ' at ' the
side of the track.
,J. 3. Spencer, who live* near the scene
of the accident, was the first to reach the
â¢pot." and 'he aided :the train crew in car
ing, for the members of the party. After
their. < Injuries 7 had' : been â¢ temporarily
dressed at the Spencer home, Allardt and
his . family " secured a .'carriage and re
turned', to. their home In this city, leavlns
the wrecked automobile where It lay be
side the track.
: In ftellrag the story > of the accident at
his home to-night,; Mr. Allardt said:
, "The whole thing happened so suddenly
that I hardly, know anything about it. I
was running not over ten miles an hour.
as I approached the crossing,, and as the
flat cars were hidden by the fence at tho
side of the right of .way I did not see tha
train until a scream from my wife caused
me to look around. There was no head
i light on the flat car at the end of tEÂ« '
train, which was bacWn? up, and I heard
neither bell * nor : whistle. * When I first
saw - the , train , It , was not more . than. nvÂ«

PLEADS GUILTY
TO THE CHARGE
CHICAGO. Dec. 9.â Dr. Oliver B. Hart,
who came to this city from St. Louis
some months ago, pleaded guilty to-day
to the murder of Irene Klokow.
The charge against Dr. Hart was mur
dering the Klokow girl, who was but 12
years of age.* by the administration of
morphine. He was left alone In the house,
with the girl. Exactly what happened
has never beer, known, but Hart called
for another physician, who came and
found the girl dying and Hart vainly at
tempting to revive . her. She died in a
few minutes, and Hart denied at the time
and until his appeaiance in court this
rooming has always denied, that he gave
the srirl morphine in sufficient quantities
to cause her death. He was asked by
Judge Barnea if he knew that under his
plea of guilty he could he sentenced to'
death, and he nodded alÃrmatively.
It was agreed by the State's Attorney
and by counsel for Hart to leave the cass
to Judge Barnes for sentence, but wll-Â»
nesses were introduced to show that Hart'
was not mentally responsible. Several,
prominent alienists, one of whom pro
nounced him a "high grade idiot." de
clared that Dr. Hart was mentally Incom
petent.
Judge Barnes took the case, under ad
visement, remarking -that he would give
his decision within a few days.

conditions and the reply, being that
they would be transferred to j Kron
stadt, they held "a meeting under the
noses 6t the officers and refused to go
until martial law was raised at Kron
stadt. Accordingly, the admiralty/ de
cided to use force. The. task of cap
turing and embarking the men was -
successfully executed under Captain j
Baron Ferzen. the former naval attache
at Washington. .
A court martial under the presidency
of Admiral Tomashevlch has been ap
pointed to try the Kronstadt mutineers

\ A delegation from the Tula Zemstvo
yesterday presented an address* tor the
Emperor, as follows:
â¢ "We adjure your Majesty toTely on trie
peaceful millions of the Russian people
who desire freedom without license. Your
Majesty has removed a burden of 80,OQ0r
000 rubles from the peasants and you
have promised relief In the matter; of
land. The Tula peasants expect help, but
not from the senseless promises of the
wicked. Your Majesty will hear the truth
not from the revolutionists but' from the
Douma, which we pray your Majesty not
to tarry in calling."
The Emperor, after thanking the dele
gation, said In reply: ~ . ;
"For a full realization of the liberties
accorded it is necessary primarily to re
store order. This is possible only by the
hearty co-operation of all the citizens of
Russia. I know that the needs of the
peasants are great and to relieve them is
my constant care. What could be done at
present has been done, but there is still
much to be accomplished, and, therefore,
it la necessary to return to peaceful pur
suits and to direct all your efforts to the
furtherance of. the objects in view. If
others follow your good example, the
work of Improving the peasants' condi
tion and the realization of the reforms
will be. greatly simplified,"
The belated press comment on President
Roosevelt's message to Congress is ex
tremely-friendly. The Slovo described the
message as "the voice of the leader of .a
great and united country, conscious of its
right to a' position in the first rank of
the councils of nations."

spoke on the subject of "The Old Navy i
and the New." - . j
"We cannot afford," said General Por- !
ter. "to rest on our laurels while rival !
nations are steadily increasing their naval ;
armament It must be remembered that i
some foreign countries continue to build i
not only powerful naval vessels, ,but at !
the same time swift commercial steamers
constructed under Government supervi
sion and subject to service as auxiliary
cruisers In time of war. We must not de
ceive ourselves as to our relative weak
ness In this respect.
"The entire world is to-day naturally
looking to peace. The only question is;
how to secure it. It has. been fully de-i
monstrated that a strong navy is not a :
menace, but a conservative : force. It
may be dangerous when '-wielded by an
THE^SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY,^DECEMBER 10. 1905:
arbitrary sovereign, but never when di
rected by the sovereign people. We have
shown that a Government may be pro
gressive without being aggressive; that a
people may be military without being
warlike. We have verified our belief that
war should be undertaken only in the in
terest of peace,. and that a nation's" pros
perity depends ,upon public' tranquillity."
' "We have as good a navy as there is
in the world to-day," said Admiral
Dewey. "We have as good ships as has
any country. We have as good officers
as can be found in any country,", although
some of us may be getting old; but," and
the admiral's face lighted up with enthu
siasm as he proceeded, "we have the best
enlisted men of any country, in -the world.
Theee men come largely , from" the West
and are the finest specimens of manhood
that America : can produce. One reason
why the American enlisted men are so su
perior; to "those of other, countries is be
cause the United States Government pays
more for;thelr. cervices,, and our war ves
sels . are so ably manned rthat I believe
that if | all \u25a0 the > officers \ on- a ship | were
killed in action .the men -could, fight 'the
ship to victory. It is the 'men behind the
guns, after all, who are the mainstay of
our navy. In these! days seamanship doe*
not count so i greatly. The pecsons who
.complain of the lack of material for our
growing navy do not, look beyond the fish
ermen of tha' Maine' coast. > But the^day
of the New England fisherman is passing.
What the navy wants now is, men ; who
can: handle atmachlnc, wideawake young
Americans, and the [ establishment of the
training station in the vicinity of Chicago
is but an illustration,, of where the^ Gov
ernment, expects to 1 secure the best men

Soecial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â Distinguished
guests were, entertained .'by. the Gridiron
Club to-night at the annual dinner. The
table at the New Willard was spread for
more than 200 persons, among them being
the"VVlce ' President, nearly all the mem
bers of the Cabinet, foreign Embassadors
and Ministers, senators' and Representa
tives and prominent men from every part
of the country. \ .
The programme | was unusually attrac
tive . and j the, .wit and humor, the .various
skits, the songs -and the- speeches, all
tended to make the. dinner, a memorable
occasion among the many given by this
famous club of Washington correspond
ents/ K%lfi,
"A Peace. Conference," composed of
members of the club,' endeavored to set
tie disputes between many guests, who
were impersonated by members of the
club,- but all .was .unavailing- until -finally \u25a0
a messenKer from William T. Jerome of
New York with a bottle of chloroform put
them to sleep. ; <
Since the club Is composed of news
paper men, it was to be expected- that'
the Presidents press-muzzling order. In
which he forbadetmembers of his Cabinet
to speak, to- Reporters,^should receive at
tention. .This 1 , was â¢ given - in ' an act in
which three new ".members of the club
were initiated. >' . , â¢
The' stage was oraped completely in
black. .To the right was a skeleton, with
glaring eyes. In the "center, seated, was
the grand inquisitor, whose make-np
clearly, indicated that he was intended to
represent the' President." To the left was
a person designated "Head Devil," who
was supposed to represent.- Secretary
Loeb. There : were,; three large electric
gridirons in the form' of chairs, and on
these the three candidates for adm'jsion
were' required to sit, while; members of
the Cabinet prodded them with ; long
toas^.ng forks.- . >'
â¢_, "Here are three candidates for admis
sion to the Gridiron Club," said the mas
ter of ceremonies.. "They are .in. a, sad,
predicament. Two' of them were caught'
red-handed .in 'writing special- dispatches,
on Cabinet matters.. . The third is, suspect-;
ed of having voted- the regular Rtpub.^
lican ticket. at the last election. : They arel
now In the hands of the grand inquisitor
and his cabinet.- ; I hope you will have,
mercy on them."k 'They nave not been used
to torment." . . , .
There followed torments In the form of
embarrassing questions put by the grand
inquisitor.: v,. .. \u0084. , ......... \u25a0::
r Ai'"the~ end' of ' theVact -everything was
blamed : on LoÂ£b.- :The*"Head Devil" and
the grand inquisiior sang- the following
song to the tune of '.'Give my Regards
'to Broadway,". the cabinet joining in the
refrain: .
I iiave Issued a new order, ' '
KeÂ«plng everybody mum;
My Cabinet keeps silent where they
Used to make things hum.
With downcast eye they pass you by,
â¢ They feel' they're dolnff wrong, .
But I laugh ha, ha, ha!
They are going too. far.
So I sins ' this- sons.

\u0084 -.- -I'll practice upon him anon;
â¢I'll find, a way! to give out news'
No matter If the gag la on.
There was also a telepathic act in which
guests of the dinner were supposed to
have written messages on slips of paper,
which were read by a professor of telepa
thy. Here are a few of. the messages al
leged to have been written:
, .'.'Secretary. Shawâ l positively refuse to
stay 'in; the Cabinet after March 4, 1909."
."Secretary Loebâ Nobody knows the
trouble I have."
'"Secretary Taftâ What's sixteen mil
lions between friends?" . \u25a0!':\u25a0\u25a0'
"Secretary Wilsonâ There's many a leak
between the ..cotton and the crook."

â¢"Senator Aldrichâ Some folks say oil
and sugar 'won't combine, but I know
they. will." * .
â¢ Several dispatches â¢- were received In a
Vfake"' wireless -telegraph -â¢apparatus/
These . were , read, greatly to the amuse
ment of the guests. * ; '
; : The : musical j numbers included * several
topical songs touching , different men
about 'the; table. OnÂ«! of \ them, . a parody

repaired there. It . was presided, over
by supervisor John Connor, chairman
of the Street Committee, who outlined
the objects and the ' conclusion of the
members In the following words:
"The United Railroads, wants to
string wires on Sutter street so that
the system will have uniformity with
the other electric roads under its con
trol. It is the duty of the Supervisors
to get what ; we can that wilt benefit
the citizens along the Sutter-street line.
The proposition, if accepted, will mean
an overnead trolley, with , feed wires
underground, ornamental poles and the
lighting, of the*' thoroughfares.
"The propcrty-owntra'on the. Sutter
street line, have selected their 'represen
tatives, as have, the citizens in other'
parts, of the -city, and public opinion
through the- press" has demanded the
underground' system;""' We-' cannot go
against- the wlll-of thepeople. Whether,
or not they are educated to the differ
ences-in the systems it, is not for us to
judge: The majority demands the un-'
derground system and it is our. duty to
give it to them. . '.
"We have consistently followed the
policy of putting all wires underground
and spent money for the buying of po
lice and ; fire alarm wires. We have
even decided to make~ the 1 Geary-street
railroad a conduit system. We have
taken into consideration- the report of
Engineer Parsons, *who holds for the
overhead- wires, andit is a question as
to whether the road is prepared to meet
the public's demands."
Supervisor Rock of the Street Com
mittee indorsed the statement of Mr.
Connor and added that. the people want
improved service and do n'ot.cara what
means of transportation are ' employed.
He said that the maJ&Tlty of the people
demanded the underground system and
that it was the du,ty of the Supervisors
to give it to them regardless of person
al opinion". "'â¢ : ~ 'â¢
Dr. A. A. D'Ancona. of the Finance
Committee said that the life of the
Sutter street franchise 'would ap
proximately twenty-three years and
that , the boarit must of necessity de
mand the most modern -system extant.
He referred to the "system of, conduits
in New York and Washington, where
the 'underground -method's efficiency
had been demonstrated, and also â¢ re
ferred to the success of the system in
the cities of Europe. He maintained
that Sutter street could not be separ
ated from Market .street and if the
overhead .was placed on Sutter street, it
must be placed on .Market and to this
the Supervisors would never consent
Supervisor Urandenstein .of the Fi
nance j Committee : expressed \u25a0 himself in
favor of the overhead^sy stem on Sut
ter street on the ground that the furn
ishing of Jight to^the city, was a bis
inducorhent and equal to police protec
tion.. He maintained, that -the railroad
company';. was' Unalterably fixed upon
the overhead or the cable system and
that Sutter street would not receive the
rapid ; . transit '\u25a0 it needs so badly. He
joined the others: in voting against thÂ«j
grfant, v however, Jon the' ground that thw
majority; of J the citizens want the un
derground system throughout the city."
': Supervisor' Braunhart of the Street
Committee said that, the question was
not alone 'as .to ;-v the road on Sutter
street, but as to" the Supervisors*, policy
concerning: an underground * system
throughout th 6 ; city, lie "I maintained
that "Engineer { Parscvns'^.yiew^nd that
of Mr, Calhoun , do": not "nxeet . the senti
ment of the pnbllc. \u25a0_:â¢: He said that the'
Street Committee .was in no '.position 'to
judge which "was^the 'best system, but
mustjcomply with the; demands of the
people.-; < : .
lie said the issue waa the uniform
system and as that 13 impossible where
cable roads are necessary. - there will
be rio uniform system throughout thÂ«
city and the company's j argument Is
thereby overcome. "He suggested as .*
possible solution the \u25a0." underground
within a certain downtown area, to jotr^
to the overhead in the outlying dis
tricts.

TALK OPENS
CAMPAIGN
Britain in Throes
of an Election
Contest.
Ex-Premier Puts Home
Rule Issue to the
Foreground.
Predicts the Utter Failure
of the Incoming Liberal
Ministry.
2kL/LNCHESTER, Dec. 9.â Arthur J. Bal
four. now the leader of the oposition
party in the United Kingdom, opened the
campaign In a stirring speech before hlfl
Manchester constituents to-day. With the
utmost frankness the ex-Premier ex
plained that the resignation of his Gov
ernment on the ground of expediency,
showing that the step had been carefully
considered for some time and that it evi
dently was contemplated by Balfour dur
ing the greater part of the year.
Balfour defended the action of the
Unionist Government in Its retention of
office on the ground that it was essential
to wait until the Anglo- Japanese treaty
were finally concluded and 'other neces
sary features of the Government pro
gramme were carried out. This had been
done, with the exception of the redistri
bution bill, an outline of which had been
given to Parliament, but divisions within
the Unionist party led the Government to
the conclusion that It would be impossi
ble at present to carry a measure which
demanded absolute unity.
Without going at any length into the
probable platform of the Liberals, the
former Premier poked fun at the Liberal
i protest against being forced to accept of
rice, and ridiculed the efficacy -of a party
composed of so many factions. He laid
the lash of bitter sarcasm -on what he
declared to be its attempts to avoid mak
ing home rule the leading issue, and said
that, whether the Liberals were ashamed
of it or not. home rulers they were and
home rulers thej- would remain.
MAKES HOME RCL.E THE ISSUE.
Balfour plainly indicated that the \u25a0 Un
iciilst attack would be centered on the
home rule record of the Liberals, while
the Unionists would use their own record
on home, foreign and colonial policies
as their bulwark of defense. Â«
He challenged the Liberals on the Issue
of Chinese labor in South Africa. Here
the former Premier became severely de
nunciatory. He said the Liberals had
won bye-elections by unscrupulous disre
gard of the truth.
"Ijcx vlb forget, if we can." he said, "the
programme ~by which they endeavored to
blacken our political life, provided that
now, when they are in a responsible po
sition, they do not kindle a feeling among
our colonies which, believe me. If once
kindled will not be easily extinguished."
Balfour made a strong plea for unity
during the elections. He hoped that
the nÂ«w administration, when it hand
ed oack the reins to the Unionists,
would be able to point to a record
equally creditable to the country. He
predicted the failure of the Liberals
to carry out their programme, which,
he understood, was the upsetting of
many things accomplished I by the
Unionists, but he hoped they would
stick to their resolution to follow the
lines of foreign policy of the Unionist
Ajovernrner.t.
I RETAINS THE LEADERSHIP.
The meeting concluded with the pass
ing of a vote of confidence in Balfour,
whereupon the former Premier, re
sponding, said he had much to say
concerning the Unionists and Liberal
programmes, but that he would reserve i
It for a more fitting occasion. He de
< lared he intended to lead the opposl-'
lion through the campaign.
The party elected me its leader and
I propose to carry out the great mls-
Fi'jn intrusted to my hands," he said.
"1 am perfectly confident that fiom all
C'-ctions of the party, be the minor dif
ferences what they may, I shall receive
that â¢ support which I have nevar
wanted for in the past." *>J
Dalfour made no reference to Joseph
Chamberlain or his fiscal policy.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has
completed his Cabinet. The King will
r-.turn to London to-morrow and re
celre the Liberal Premier in audience ;
et Buckingham Palace in the evening \
in order to give his formal approval of
the Ministry. The members of the Bal
four Cabinet will give up their seals of
office at a meeting to be held at noon
on Monday and their successors will
take over their seals at a second meet
ing of the Privy Council on Monday
afternoon. Â« i

KEEP, STRONG.
To keep up strength and vltallty.it
is necessary that the supply of nour-

tJlKfÃtcd food supplies this want, but
when the stomach is weak, fennenta-

WILL NOT AMEND
EXCLUSION ACT
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â Congress
will not enact any legislation modify
ing the Chinese exclusion act. As a
resulL/*he boycott of American goods
will be relmposed shortly, and there
will be a greater development of the
anti-foreign feeling throughout China.
The prediction as to the attitude of
Congress was made yesterday, by lead
ers of both House and Senate. The
policy of the Chinese people Is based
entirely upon this attitude. In edicts
Issued by the Chinese Emperor the
people were urged to refrain from boy
cotting American goods pending-action
by Congress. The viceroys of various
provinces proclaimed President Roose
velt had given assurances that Con
gress would pass remedlary. measures
and that the Chinese' should^ continue
.to purchase American goods as hereto
fore until the purposes of the legisla
tive branch of the American ; Govern
ment developed.
It Is believed the Chinese legation
here has been making inquiries as to
the'prospect of action by Congress, and
is satisfied there Is no chance whatever
of the enactment of satisfactory legis
lation.
The deadlock has occurred in the
treaty negotiations between Minister
Rockhlll and Na Tung of the Chinese
Foreign Office as a result of the refusal
the former to allow the admission
of Chinese laborers into the American
"possessions In the Pacific. In exchange
for this privilege Na Tung .was willing
to define the classes of Chinese. which
should be granted: entrance Into 'the
United States, thus authorizing .this
Government to' exclude every one who
failed- to come directly within- those
classes. With Congress unyielding: and
treaty negotiations impossible; of suc
cessful. conduct, the I President \u0084is con
fronted by the probability of a serious
blow < to ; American \u25a0' commerce in ; the
Orient. "- During; the I last \u25a0 year ; increase
of export, was "chiefly to China,; Japan
and four other countries, amounting In
the case of the first named empire; to
$41,000,000. Of -'this ."sum * $23,500,000
was In cotton dothV $10,000,000 in
per and $3,500,000; in 'mineral : oils."

DISCUSS EVILS
OF CHILD LABOR
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. â At , yester
day's session of the National Child La
bor Committee Felix AdleY of New York
city, chairman of the National Com
mittee, spoke' on "The Menace of Child
Labor." â¢ ~
Dr. Adlcr^said that while the Ameri
can conscience revolts against women
In ; certain parts of Europe performing 1
hard labpr in the fields,' there are in this
country' between one\and two million
child laborers. '\u25a0 \u25a0 . /
The evil. Dr.? Adler contended, was
not only widespread, but steadily In
creasing:. There Were, ho stated/about
10,000 children 'working about the
mines, about 7000 in the glass industry
and the number of child laborers in. the
Southern textile mills has ; increased
within a few, years from Â£4,000t0 about
60,000. | He said there was reason to be
lievo that in other parts of the country
similar conditions exist.' The cause of
the ' evil : he declared to be ','the Ameri
can disease"â the same disease the
fearful "symptoms of which lately have
been -exposed "in* the investigation of
the insurance ;. commission jg in New
York^ â the separation 1 between ! business
and morals . and the unscrupulous
regard of rights of ; which material suc
cess is at stake. V
â¢ lie declared. \u25a0 however, that theVcoh
sclcnce' oi' the people^ was everywhere
awakening and there , wibre , signs of a
great moral upheaval," and that the chil

MUNYON'S
14 th ANNUAL
FREE DISTRIBUTION
OR HIS
RHEUMATISM CURE
BEGINS TODAY
On Monday, December nth, I
shall commence the 14th annual dis-
tribution of my remedies from the
San Francisco Examiner by giving
away my Rheumatism Cure. I most
earnestly as"k every skeptic, every
doubter and every person who has
failed to get relief from their physi-
cian or from other medicines to I call
for a sample bottle. These little
sugar pellets are absolutely harmless.
They contain no salicylic acid, no
morphine or opium, no drug of any
kind that puts the disease to sleep
or paralyzes the nerves.
This remedy will not only cure
Rheumatism, but is a splendid stom-
ach, nerve andj heart tonic â
It neutralizes the uric acid and
eradicates all rheumatic poisons from
the system. IT EFFECTS A PER-
MANENT CURE.
I have given away more than a mil-
lion bottles of this remedy in differ-
ent pan* of the world to prove that it
cure? Rheumatism. This free distri-
bution is in no sense a charity. It
shculd interest every sufferer of
Rheumatism. I want the public's
confidence and the only way to gain
this confidence is by proving that all
I say is true.
If you are unable to call for free
sample, you can buy the remedy at
any drug store for 25 cents.

BRAZIL ENTERS
FORMAL PROTEST
Objects to, the Seizure -of ran
Alleged Deserter by the
German Gunboat Panther
SEVEBB BREACH OP -LAW
Kaiser, It Is Thought, Will
Give Prompt Redress When
He Learns of the Incident
â _\u2666
WASHINGTON. Dec. 9.-The Brazilian
Embassy in this city has receiveda tele
gram from Baron Ac Rio Branco, the Mln
ifiter of Foreign Affairs, stating that a
few days a*o several of the officers of the
German gunboat Panther went ashore in
civilian dress "and visited a small fishing
town called Itajahy, in the Stats' of Santa
Catalina, and there, without any form of
process, seized a hnan by the name of
Steinhoff, who had left his native coun
try. Germany, as a deserter from the
army, and took him with them as a pris
oner on the Panther. Thereupon the gun
boat left Itajahy and went to another port
in the State of Rio Grande do SuL The
three Brazilian cruisers, Almirante Bar
rao, Benjamin Constant and Tamandare,
were sent to watch the Panther and see
that no similar occurrences should again
happen, while the Brazilian Government
made an official protest against the action
of those officers to the German Govern
ment.
Sylvlno Curgel do Amarala, First Secre
tary of the Brazilian Embassy,, declared
to-day that the relations between Ger
many ajid Brazil' have of late been vtry
cordial, and when the present Minister
of Foreign Affairo, Baron de Rio Branco,
left Berlin, where for several, years he
had represented Brazil, the Emperor made
it a special point io snow him the great
est good will. It was therefore regretted
at the Brazilian Embassy that this inci
dent had happened, though it is felt that
Germany will give prompt and full re
dress for what at, first may appear to be
a severe breach of international law.
AMERICAN LAW TRIUMPHS.
Boy Taken Off German Liner by Writ
of Habeas Corpus.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. â The American
law was upheld to-day in a clash with
German authorities over the posses
sion of Louis Brahm, a German boy,
charged with desertion. Three minutes
before he was to have sailed as a
prisoner on the steamship Amerika for
Germany and twenty-four hours after he
had been given up to German authority
by this Government, Brahra was taken
off the ship 'and back under American
authority again by a writ of habeas
corpus from the United States District
Court. Yesterday the German Con
sul, after a strenuous effort, had the
boy turned over to him as a deserter
from the steamship Pennsylvania.
Brahm did not desert willingly, his
ship having sailed while he was serv
ing a sentence in an American Jail for
disorderly conduct. United States Mar
shal Mayhew said that he served the
writ of habeas corpus last night, but
that thd^German authorities were slow
in executing it and that an' officer said
to him: .
' "What right has any one to take a
man off a German boat?"

BIRD GAMBLING
A LONDON SPORT
Singiiig Contests? Held on
Sundays by the' Hooligans
in the English Metropolis
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 9.â One of London's
least known but most curious sights, is
thft remarkable "Bird . Fair 1 ' held every
Sunday 'morning in the famous White
cfcapel District As^early as 7 "o'clock
members of the Hooligan hordes that in
fest this district; begin to assemble in
Sclater street, not far, from the White
chapel road. Each man carries a . small
square parcel, wrapped .about' 'with ' a
black cloth. All the: little black parcels
contain birdsâ larks, linnets, blackbirds,
canaries and bullfinches.! Even sparrows
are brought- to this strange assembly,
but they are more or hees disguised,, many
of them beingr actually painted to rep-,
resent canaries, linnets and other birds.
It is a singular j thing . to see London
Hooligans ' playing . the role 'i of bird = fan
ciers and yet, on Sundays, bird life seems
to occupy their whole | attention, gj Salva
tion Army officers have made repeated ef
forts to break iup I these assemblies and
persuade the bird gamblers, for such they
are,' to ' abandon ; their . Sunday .: morning
trade", and even the police have attempted
to stop it. . But the '.'Bird Fair" has held
its own despite' all interference from out
siders There is no specific act of Parlia
ment against' dealiniz i with birds on Sun
day morning in London, and,, until such
an act is passed, the bird fair is likely to
continue. â¢ :.
The peculiar I attraction- of; the \"Blrd
Fair*,' to the' Hooligan consists In the fact
that one may buy a singing bird for about
15 cents and,' before the day , is out, s ; make
anywhere from J2 50 to $10 out of ; him ; In
various ; Ringing ) contests { that '^take * place
in -the" back ' rooms ,ot ; certain: saloons : in
the neighborhood.^ As : the; average 'week
ly waee tot i most â¢; of \ these â¢ men^does \ not
amount to more, than J3 to $4,' the making
of 110 ' on Sunday \ morning is â¢ something
worth :Stri vine for. ; -/_ ;; â¢v^
The * people who -, engage lin the v.VÃird
Fair," or as it should be called,' the A'BItA
Monte Carlo," ;' do not seem . to : look ;bn. the
reverse \u25a0} side of '- the i olctiire i to ; consider,
what a big hole .the loss- of \u25a0 a dollar] of. so
makes In a ; small weekly, wage.' % The fas-;
clnatlne : f airy i tales | that", float; a bout ; of
how : certain â¢ ; "winners';^ haye r I made )\ as
much as $50 for their owners in the course
of â¢ a - f e*r- singing! contests \ lead â¢. most \u25a0\u25a0 of
these' : people \u25a0 lnto'*v looking :S for similar
feathered cold mines. ; Needless to say,
however, the bird owner who brlns^i the
average songster to " ; the Sunday, fair goes
home a sadder. If not a wiser, man;. only
to come again the following Sunday with
renewed \u25a0'. hopes.
CONTESTS IN SALOONS^ \u25a0
As a matter, of fact, this bird gambling
Is one of the greatest of. evils, among
the working 'classes . of the lower type.
Gambling. In some- form or 1 other, to
gether , ! with drinking^ are the two great
i evils of -England. 'Much is said every
J year of the terrible sufferings of* the un
j employed, but it is recognized that If . the
gambling and | drink -evil were checked
these sufferings in many cases would not
exist; or, If they did. they- would ; not be
nearly bo acute. , ' '
During tho week days British laborers,
not the men making from J7 per week up
ward, but those earning less than $5, spend
a large portion of their;' wagers in backing
"tips" from various i sporting v papers |on
horse racing, and when Sunday- comes,
and there is no race, they go in for/"bird
gambling, [ rabbit â¢. coursing, | dog j and ( cock
fighting and^ , other forma of betting
amusements." , : .
The system of; bird gambling is run, on
almost as \ scientific a basis as | that \u25a0; of
horse racing, v Everybody: who has a bird
that can sing a few : notes * has a chance
of winning .-.-'something; .'depending, /of
course, on the . nature ; of the contest . he
goes in for. : The v highest "winnings are
made with j larks and piping bullfinches.
7lf | a man has - one of these', birds that
can sing ; fairly j well Â» he % takes ?it to ;. tha
back room of. a saloon; or '.'public house,"
as i itj iÂ» i called " in v London,; and | the bird,
, with others, ' Is .? placed " in Jits cage -: on '* a
ehel * which, â¢as tal rule, extends . entirely
around the four "sides of the room. This
. shelf \ will .-\u25a0\u25a0 Sometimes -; : accommodate 'as
many . ; as a \ hundred 'V? cages. In , .other*
; places; the ; cages J are hung ; on one side
of the' room j from the ceiling to the floor.
The gambling. Â« audience, ~j. consisting â¢of
owners ; of ; birds, " : seat . themselves ?\u25a0, on
benches in T front, of , the r cages or, stand in
rows, - while . thetbirds â¢ are", encouraged by
whistles Uo ;.; sing . their .:â¢ best. % ' Each v bird
owners must deposit" with thal'.'publlcan,"
or saloon-keeper,\ before : entering his | bird
i the ) sum of i twelve ; cents. ;â¢*. As there > are
often as t many . as 100 ' entries, this : means
of , 512 1 is put up as? the; winning

j^The? t excitement % which 7 arathers ; around
the two or three remaining contestants
Is often very intense;* and occasionally
fights grow. out of the remarks of praise
or disapprobation whlch'rise to the" lips
of spectators. The saloon-keeper, at the
end of the contest, hands over the win
nings of the lucky owner of the bird ad
judged to be the \ best singer. The win
ner is supposed to spend a good deal of
his money on beer for the crowd, .arid
thus do "the "publicans" obtain their
share, often a large one, of the winnings.
Other contests, with linnets, blackbirds,
bullfinches and canaries, are conducted on
similar lines, though usually the entry
fees are smallerâ from 2 cents up to 8
cents .for other birds than larks. . -
Naturally a large traffic -in selling birds
Is done in the streets near I the places
where contests are held. -These birds are
placed in cages and'hung on the walls of
the shops outside as high as the first
story windows. The larks and llnnets_are
placed on the upper rows (otherwise They
refuse to sing), the canaries and others
below. There are also many street ven
dors who sell singing birds, each one sup
posed to-be a winner, you hear on every
hand cries such as:
"'Ere yer areâ 'oo says a singing' lark

ITALIAN WINE GROWERS
ARE IN AN ANGRY MOOD
ROMEÂ» Dec 9.â Recently there has beea
considerable agitation by southern wine
growers over* the commercial modus vl
vehdl between Italy and Spain, under
which a duty of $4 on every 100 kilos oÂ£
Spanish wine is reduced" to S2 40. Tha
growers claim that the Spanish will com
pete with their product and compel them
to reduce their price.
The agitation to-day reached such a,
point that several demonstrations wera
made. At Aurlsano, during an attempt
to attack the City Hall, the police wero
obliged to use their arms. One person
was killed and several were wounded.Considerably Under Price

STATE TROOPS
ARE IMPROVING
WASHINGTON. Dec. 9.â General F. C.
AJnsworth, militia secretary, m his re
port on the militia of the United States,
says it is estimated that about 75 per cent
of the organized militia would respond to
the call for troops to repel invasion or
suppress insurrection against the. author
ity of the United States, the percentage
being the same as that estimated for the
preceding year. Continuing, the secre^
tary says: ; â¢ . ' \u25a0 .
"Incrase of interest pn the part of the
younger men in . the militia has been
marked and the, morale of the organiza
tions has "been | appreciably advanced/
With but, few exceptions, where organi
zations have been reported upon adverse
ly , by, inspection officers, the State mlH
tary authorities! have promised to" adopt
remedial measures. Resignations of offi
cers have frequently, been called for and

SEEKING WORK,
FINDS DEATH
An Italian boy. not 8 years old, was
playing yesterday morning at the foot
of the great cliff cut into the eastern
flanks of Telegraph Hill by the quarry
ing- of Gray Bros., when he came upon
what looked like a bundle of discarded
clothing*. He stepped near, very curi
'â¢us. and a second glance sent him
scampering: to his playmates â ,-ith a cry
of fear. That flacjid thing upon the
ground was a man; a man broken to
I-ieces. Above him, 250 feet, towered
â¢he rock walls of the cliff. At the top
of the cliff, from below, slight as the
scratch of a finger nail, the yellow
f-arth was disturbed at one spot as if
It had been clawed by a strong man
trying to clutch himself back to safety.

That spot of disturbed earth above,
that broken body below told a tale.
Between them was 250 feet of breath
less, cannon ball like descent from life
to death, and the man had taken it.
That man lies at the Morgue now,
with an air strangely dignified and
composed. His name, probably, is; Peter
Slovin, a poll tax receipt made out in
that name having been found on' his
person.' Outside of that little, is known,"
except that he was big and' very strong,
and also that in death, In spite of his
shattered body, his face is one of
strong beauty.
PLUXGES .FRO3I CLIFF.
Peter Slovln, If that is his name,
came to San Francisco yesterday morn
ing and took a room at the Pacific lodg
ing-house, 209 Leldesdorff street, j Ho
had been working, he told the pro
prietor, at the Six-MilÂ© cut-off of the
Ocean Shore Railroad. Late in the
afternoon he left, after asking ques
tions as to the quarrying going on at
Telegraph Hill, that now lead the po
lice to believe that he intended to go
there and seek employment. He did
not return and the rest is surmise. But
It is "probable that in a blind reareh

for the quarrying people who are at
its bottom, he wandered instead up the
steep siaes of Telegraph Hill along
Kearny -.street, then turning at right
angles along Green, found himself as
the winter <iay e'neted and darkness fell
upon the summit. It was black up
there and the blackness under foot waa
made only blacker by the myriad elec
tric lights of the city far' below and the
red and green lights of*shlps at anchor
in the Day. But still stubbornly intent
upon his search for the quarry, where
he was to hnd work, Peter tilovin kept
on. And suddenly the earth \u25a0 disap
peared from beneath his feet,.there was
a- moment's desperate clutching at
treacherous, crumbling earth, then the
whirling-, flight -to death. .
INGENIOUS -DEATH TRAP. "
For up there on,. Telegraph .Hill ,/is
the most ingenious ' death trap ever
created by tne carelessness of man
toward man. Green street there ends
abruptly in an abyss, at the bottom of
whicn Gray Bros.' rock crusher pulses
night and day. A fence there is across
the street, it is true, but it is an irony
of a fence. Slot rails from the old cable
line that used to climb the hill years
ago have been stuck in the ground- at
intervals of fifteen feet. Between them
run a strand of the rusted cable that
used to raise the cars and two other
lines of thinner wire.. But these iron
ropes sag between the ; posts so that
they *are a bare two feet along the
ground. On the right hand side of the
street ;thls sag is. accentuated between
the last two posts till the rope actually
touches the ground. And^ right there"
the ground breaks inttf a : chute of
crumbling, sand that ; ends twenty > feet
below in . the smooth, perpendicular
rock of , the cliff. In that ehuto' of; soft
sand \ yesterday j there were*>unmistak-,
able signs of clawings and scratchings.
And rights belowâ 250 feet â there was
a little rusty red spot in the earth at
the place where the goat-like ; Tele- .
graph Hill little boys had made their
discovery. . y :
So Peter Slovln, . strong working
man, in .'.' search of work found ; death
because of man'i carelessness Ito man.

JAPANESE
REJECT SOME
BAD LEATHER
Mikado's Government Sends
â¢Back on Manchuria 1000;
Bales of Taiined
Condemned as Worthless
AS PAPER
Yankee of the Orient Proves
Too Smart for a : Tlirii
ty Boston Manufacturer
Who Loses a Smig Sum
Japan wants no wooden nutmeg's, and
the trader : of . Down Eastern America
will have to learn some new tricks be
fore he can unload gold bricks. upon
the Ytfnkee of the Orient. The antl-.
American' boycott -may â¢ have struck
American' trade -in the Far East some
heavy blows, -.but an enterprising;, firm
of Boston tanners seems to have been
responsible for -an act Of commercial
hara-kiri ;in the Japanese market that
may work incalculable harm . to this
country's reputation in the Orient. .
I There is now. being discharged from
the liner Manchuria a large shipment
of leather which was rejected by the
Japanese ' Government. There are 1000
bales of this leather, and it was sent to
Japan from Boston, to which city it Is
being- returned as fast as It can be
loaded into freight "cars.
.Japan has been a large purchaser of
leather since the beginning of her war
with Russia and. she has bought much
of it tn the United States. She paid a fair
price and the American tanner reaped
a rich harvest % from , ; tho brisk .. trade
developed by the war. Whole cargoes
of leather have been shipped to Japan
and it was . this . heavy demand which,
may have' suggested 'to the 'mind: of
some thrifty tanner that in '. the rush
the Japanese would: not be too" par-:
tlcular about quality.
The rejected leather- now â¢ being
transferred from the Manchuria to the
freight, cars tells its own story. It has
been "acid tanned," say the experts. It
does not require an expert to judge of
its uselessness. As a substitute for

erhood. The benefits that would accrue
to the American Guild from such absorp
tion may be : seen in these figures, given
out at the offices of the Fraternal Broth
erhood'to-day and taken from official in
surance reports: . /*>
Membership, American Guild 24,324, Fra
ternal Brotherhood more than 27,000; av
erage death rate for. the.last seven years,
American Guild 9.9 per thousand. Frater
nal Brotherhood less than half' that rate;
average age of members,' American Guild
42 years, Fraternal Brotherhood 34 years;
available assets January 1, 1905, American
Guild $115,562, Fraternal Brotherhood
5145,324 SO.
The rate paid by the American Guild
for new members is ?13 each.. "Amalgar
xnation" on this basis would have cost
the Virginia order $351,000. and this is the
amount which, it is charged, was to have
been paid Dandy, Beck, Hitchcock and
Bulla personally for delivering the Fra
ternal Brotherhood into the hands of the
American Guild, in spite of the fact that
the combined available assets of the two
orders is $100,000 short of that sum.
The "amalgamated" orders would still
have owed Dandy, Bulla, Beck and Hitch
cock $100,000 for . "amalgamating" them
after every cent of funds^ including all
the money set aside for the payment of
death claims, had been turned over to the
four Los Angeles men.
Samuel J. Chappel, who was assistant
to Supreme President Dandy, says â¢he
learned that of the $351,000 to be> received
by Dandy, Bulla, Beck and Hitchcock'
$5000 each was to be "slipped" to him
self, Mrs. Emma R. Neidig - (then su
preme vice president). and Superintendent
of Public Schools James. A." Foshay, su
preme past president, who composed the
remainder of the executive council of the
.Brotherhood. . , ; ,-- â¢ \-. . V
At the right moment Chappel told the
four officers what he. knew. Immediately
a meeting of the executive council was
called and the resignations followed *in
quick order. Also Immediatel Mrs." 1 , Nei-*.
dig was elected supreme pr . ident and
Chappel supreme vice preslc'^nt, H. V.
Davis supreme secretary. Dr. <j> W. Pierce

Ott'Â« dinner xÂ«it Yet Found.
Thomas McMillln. chief of police at
Albuquerque, has written fto^Cfilef
Dinan. a letter bearing out the state
ments In his dispatches that no bottle
containing JllOO in bills said to have
/-been burled in Deputy Marshal Jordan's
yard there by Jordan artcr being taken
from John Ott could be found. Jordan,
he said, denied emphatically that Ott
had Riven nirn the money or that he
had ever seen It. Ott was thorou^hly
searched when arrested, but only Jl9O.
which he claimed was his own coin,
â¢eras found upon him. Ott says that the
reason the money was not discovered
when he was searched was because it
was hidden in a railroad time table.
Mc.Millin asks that Ott be taken back
to Albuquerque to -face Jordan, but
Chief Dinan will await further com
rnunicatious from there before deciding
upon any action. Ott stole the SHOO
frdm his friend Frank Johnson.

Hears tife-Tale of
His Partner in

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"With $276 â¢in his posessslon Harry
Frank Radar, whose turkey.-breedlne:
farm nestles in the - Liver more \ Valley,
Indiscreetly visited a Paclnc-street
dance hall, with the "result that Miss
Sadie LNfegel, a ' youthful and 'petite
brunette,-; was arrested on his com
plaint that she had feloniously relieved
him' of $250 in bilfs. She was booked
for , grand larceny and vagrancy, but
when the 'case was called before Police
oudg-e -Fritz the complainant displayed
such reluctance to prosecute her that
lie"- was ordered into custody lest he
depart -the bailiwick ere the hearing is
resumed; to-morrow morning. Among
the Court, attaches opinion was about
equally divided as -to whether Mr.
Rader's leniency was provoked by the
beseeching glances flung at him by
Miss, Na gel's tearful eyes of baby blue
or was purchased for cash by some of
her, friends. Patrolman Nelson, who
arrested the young woman, enthusias
tically supported the latter conjecture.
,/Mr. Rader averred that the missing
money was a portion of the proceeds
.of his sale of turkeys for Thanksgiving
consumption and he explained his so
journ in the city by Btatihg that he had
deposited many gobblers " in . cold stor
age' and is awaiting the opening of the
demand for Christmas fare. It was to
while away a tedious evening that he
toured the Barbary Coast, a region of
which he often had heard .and 'read,
and when he dropped "Into "the dance
hall and saw Miss Nagel, his -pity was
touched by the sight of such youth and
beauty and -seeming ingenuousness
amid cuch an environment. Several
other women- vied in casting blandish
ments 'at him, but .he : had eyes and
thought for Miss Nagel only, and while
he . ' was ' devising : possible ways and
means by which she might be guided:
to a better life she abandoned the em- !
brace' of her masculine partner of the
moment and transferred her attention
to-him. i
Mr. Rader quickly discovered that
her mental graces were no less attrac
tive than her physical charms. While
tripping 'a two-stop with her his left
ear was made recipient of her life
story, \u25a0 pantingly unfolded, . and â¢it
clinched his . determination .to be the
medium of elevating to higher social
sphere an undeserving victim of heart
less parental rapacity. He was on the
| point of offering her $40 a month and
j "found" to serve as a turkey herder for
| him, said vocation being both light and
: respectable, whcn v an indefinable some
thing impelled him to feel !f-the"f2so'
'paper "currency , was in the- pocket
where he had pinned It ere he sallied
forth to slum. Lo! it was not there! -.\
In the confusion created by Mr.
Rader's announcement of .his loss Miss
Nag'el j disappeared, and when she was
discovered and arrested by Patrolman
Nelsonthe 'missing cash was not in her
possession. Mr. Rader was then cer
tain that no person other than she had
opportunity to rob him, but In court he
was less positive as to her guilt, espe
cially after he had encountered an ap
pealing shot from the tear-laden eyes
of baby blue.

Samuel Zimmerman, a young fellow
who came from a well-ordered home at
Sulsun to dwell in the city, was ar
rested for vagrancy by Patrolman Ly-,
cett, who informed Judge Mogan that
on the Barbary Coast the youth was
commonly known as "the Alcohol Kid,"
the - sobriquet having been earned by
his practice of imbibing spirits of alco
hol by surreptitiously sucking it
through a straw. Inserted in the reser
voirs of lamps : utilized as cigar light
ers. "'He will be sentenced to-morrow.

A. Buckley, United States Marine Corps,
strutted the retail ' district last { Friday
afternoon and divided his time between
ogling passing femininity and consum

more liquor he tippled, the less respect
did he manifest for the women ho met,
until his language and his actions
actually -became ungallant, if nfet in

Among the things which Private
Buckley is alleged to hav6 said .to. fair!

LOS AXGEL.ES, Dec. 9.â ln a fierce fire
that swept over Echo Mountain . to-day,
beginning in the early morning hours and
lasting throughout . the aay, numerous
buildings on the mountain top were de
stroyed, me cable incline railway was
put out of business, and a scope of the
mountain, many square miles in area,
was burned bare.. The . white-fronted
group of structures, prominent as land
marks for miles around, are a heap of
ashes.
Ail day long the flre swept and crept
about the mountain sides, eating its way
through Dine trees and acres of shrub
bery. The v^orst of the blaze was over,
however, before thenoon hour, and alter
that the rtames burnt on sullenly, but
with little force, isy 6 o'clock, this even
ing nothing could be discerned of the
blaze but a . little smo&e and ah occa
sional flicker -of - light from smoldering
embers. S^B^amsgMÃgewffiÃaeswc:
It is not possible to accurately estimate
the property loss at this time. It may
reach upwards of a quarter of a million
or it may be fa^- less than that
The famed Alpine tavern, several miles
beyond, on Mount Lowe, and the white
buildings of 'the solar observatory were
untouchedfl. The , almost priceless Instru
ments in the observatory were hastily
removed during the morning and sunk
Jnto the waters of a nearby reservoir,
for there was great fear that the all
pervading heat might crack ' or â¢ mar the"
delicate glass and mechanical work, even
though the flames did not touch the ob
servatory building. \u25a0\u25a0' At one time the
flames were within 500 feet of the obser
vatory. A resume of the damage as far
as now known -sh&WB that of the little
village of structures on the top of the
Echo Mountain, the chalet, or ;.' hotel,' was
destroyed by the \u25a0 flaihes: the casino, or
dancing , pavilion. ! was first blown down
[by the wind and then burned ; the Pacific
eiectric f power . honse,, containing highly
valuable* machinery, was destroyed, and
! It is said that much of the machinery Is
Irreparably- damaged, the car barns also
being burned." v . , ' â¢ :
In addition; to this the upper trestle of
the incline railway was burned. The
flames swept along , the " 3030 feet of in
cline tracks for a ways ." and ; the $12,000
cable was more or less v injured by the
heat. Workmen, to save I the huge cable,
cut it and allowed it to slip and foil to
the bottom of the steep Incline.
-The origin of the fire", is not definitely
known and may never;, be. .f A peculiar
phase is that fire broke out in ; two places
almost simultaneously , at i the ; top |of Echo
Mountain and also clear down at v the bot
tom. " The first . theory; was that the jWlnd
blew down . the ; garbage crematory ; about
6:30 'o'clock in the morning,, and that the
gale which knocked "the Â« crematory, over
also carried sparks ; from r there clear^to
the bottom of the 4 mountain. '."
The second . theory: Is that the gale j that
blew at daylight , knocked " over ; trees '.or
branches -. which >:, tell across * some bf ; the

The trouble between Warden J. W.
Toinp'kins of . San Quentln \u25a0 prison , and
the officers -under his command seems
to "bo at a feverish heat over the state
ment made by Tompklna last week to
the effect that someone had cut^letters
out- of his private letter-book. At
that time he "did not say whom he be
lieved the guilty parties to be. but ho
strongly insinuated that the work was
done by ; some of the officers of the
prison, who are supposed to be fighting
to secure, his dismissal jrom the office
of warden. "... , ."- â¢~. â¢> \u0084. ''

Master of Despatch
Responsible for
Boy 's Death.
Inspector "Tells of Re
fusal to Go Into
the Mold.
At, 3 o'clock Friday afternoon James
Guthrie. Assistant United "States Inspect
or of Boilers and Hulls, being aboard tho
ill-fated oil tank- steamer Despatch to in
spect her, refused to descend Into her
hold with the open light furnished >by
Captain Weber and insisted upon an
electric light. The odor of escaping saa
and the evident signs of leakage mada
him energetic in his rerusal and bis re
quest. At that same moment four Uttla
boys were inside the boilers of the ves
sel," scraping the rust to tho light or
candles. Two hoars later there was an
explosion. ThreÂ«-of the* boyg escaped
with burns, but Jimmy Mitchell, smallest
of them all and only 10 years old, was
.caught. ln the whirlwind of firs and gas
'and was taken out dead.
Thus, It would seÂ«m. tho master
of the ship, with full warning and cog
nizance, deliberately left tne boys in their
situation of deadly peril. But that is not
aIL VThe reason for" employing boys ut
/all demands â¢ investigation. Inspector
Guthrie says that, although boys slip
more 'easily into the ooilers. It Is poasibio
for men to do icr. And; In' fact. last year
men were employed to do the work upon
the Despatch." But at that tuna the men.
fearful of the condition of the ship and
having care for - their lives, refused to
' work .till " the boilers had been aerated
; for two days." This time, Inspector Guth
! rlo says, the " condition of the ship was
worse than . at the time of the cleaning
last year. But this time. the boiler clean
ers did not demand two days of airing
before going to work. They did not know
enough to ask for that, for they were
! only .' very . little , boys. So they worked
about the leaking tanks, in the gaseous
atmosphere, with open lights, till they
vrere^blownup. 1 .

If anybody asks you the name of the
best horse in California, tell that per
son Boareatcher. The great brown
horse lived up to the prognostications
of his owner. Garnet Ferguson, in cap
turing the valuable Crocker selling
makes yesterday at Oakland track. He
won in decisive fashion and tset the
coast record at J:3S%. The former
record of I:3S=Â» was made by Divina
at Sacramento some three years ago.
The big half holiday . gathering went
u-Ild as McÃride. holding Bearcatcher
under mild restraint, passed the judges
iÂ»n easy wiuner. When the time was
tfashed a second and tremendous ova

SaUie McAllister, and his rider.
Til KEF. GO TO POST.
When owners had done with the
ecratching blank, but three starters re
mained Bearcatcher 117. San Nicolas
112 and Princess Titania 99. Dargrin.
NigTctte, Judge and Red Leaf were
the absentees. When Jack Keene
scratched the last named mare, *'Packy"
Ryan snapped up 'Radtke to ride San
Kicolas. This accession no doubt con
tributed to making the black horse
favorite, for he opened at 7 to 10, with
7 to S chalked against Bearcatcher.
I'rincess had many admirers, even
though the distance looked a furlong:
too far for the mare. At the start Jake
Jlotman sent the trio away with Bear
catcher barely straight and as a con
sequence the brown was cut on* at the
rrst tcrxu Not the least apprehensive,
McÃride permitted Princess and the
lavorite to* blaze the trail for half the
journey. Then he let out a link and
as he did San Nicolas lagged behinl,
beater.. Princess Titania responded
jjobly to Sam Greenfield's urging, but it
was like a mosquito fighting a game
cock.
BEARC VTCIIKirs CLKVER. RACE.
Bearcaicher fctrode to the front, winning
leisurely by three and a half lengths. The
lace was worth $2650 to the winner.
The closing day of the first season at
Oakland will long be remembered, for the
<.aiiber of the eport has never* been sur
passed at the course over the bay. Sec
ond cniy to the magniueent run of Bear
catcher was the superb performance of
Cruzados. which narrowly missed equal
ing a long-standing record, in another
event. Spectacular finishes were almost
the rule throughout, and everybody de
parted for home In a happy mood. Three
favorites were returned winners.
E. J. Baldwin's Santa Anita flyer, the
stately Cruzados, annexed the $1000 spe
cial, at five furlongs. Cruzados should
ered 123 pounds, and going to the post an
n to 10 favorite, with Frank Prior in the
saddle, beat Tocolaw more than a length
in :59 ; i,. This is within a quarter of a
,e< cor.d of the coast record, made at Jiie
o!i Bay District track in 1895 by George
F Smith, a four-year-old, carrying 100
jic \inds. H. L. Frank, a 25 to 1 shot,
v.iich ran third, led to the stretch, where
I'iior let the lavorite down and he as
sumed control. Much was expected of
Cloud!!.ght, but she was messed about at
the start, falling to cut a figure.
SCIIEnZfI IS FAVORITE.
Tl c bookies took no chance of going to
a "Outch" in the prices laid about the
half-dozen starters in the opening six and
a hi .If furlong event. It was 3 to 1 bar
two at the start, with Scherzo finally en
joying the call. , . . ... ..,
The favorite lacked speed and was
lortanate to take the show. T. Sul
livai landed Crigli, a 4% to 1 chance.

he arrived at the house there was no
need for his services, and the body was
moved by Deputy Coroner A. P. Smiley

thought that in a fit of despondency fol
lowing a spree he decided to end his life.

The fourth of a series of handicap dou

caps were unusually large only two
matches required the full -three sets.

were close, but the majority were not.: '

the most heavily handicapped teams. "
reached the final round without meeting 1
defeat. L. Levinson and H. Getz. Who
have won the cups twice and needed only"
one more victory, lost the closest match,
of the day to Guerln and Patterson. The
losers won the first set and . almost .took
the third, but had to content themselves
with the short end. . ' â¢)
McLougblin and Strachan have won tha..
cups once, but their chances of winningi
on Monday do not look any too good, la .
the semi-ftnals with H. Guerln and \\\ "
Patterson they lost the first set, 6-0. and
were tied in the second at 6-6, when
darkness put a stop to play. Playing,
from 40 below scratch, McLoughlin and
Strachan hardly looked to have a chance, .
In their first match they allowed the tre- 1
mendous odds of 15 4-6 and owe 10 and
won easily. Harston and Jlasgs were
the victims.
In their next match McLougrhlin and"
Strachan found the Williams brothers-,
much harder to dispose of. The odds werÂ«
the same as In the previous match, buf
the losers managed to annex a set. The
two sets wen .by McLoughiln &Â°'f^
Sxrachan were one-sided. "^
! In the sem'-flnals AlaLoughlln and
Strachan gave owe odds of 20 to Guerln
and Patterson. The latter made good
use of the odds and piled up a. big lead
on their opponents. McLoughlin and
Strachan failed to win a game in the first
set, but fought stubbornly in the second
'set and managed, to hold their opponents
down. â¢
Both the remaining teams in the upper
half reached the semi-finals quite easily.*.
Smith and Murray had to plity ,hut"*.ona
match and they had no trouble 'winning.
They beat Huff and Curtis in straight
sets. Levinson and Garcia won two
matches without exerting themselves. '

Sensational Testimony Given
Against Superintendent of
an Industrial School
Er*c!al Dispatch to The Call
TN'DIANAPOLIb. Dec. 3.â There have
>een many investigations of Indiana
Institutions 5 , but in none have there de-
Telcped such stories of cruelty as those
Vhich have been told on the witness
â¢ta;id in tij# case of the management of
the Women's Prison and Industrial School
#<â¢* Girls.
flf ; : has appeared inconceivable that Miss
fcniily Rhoades. the superintendent, could
be guilty cf such cruelty as many of the
nesses have related. These witnesses,
*rith few exceptions, were former Â«xn
ploys of the institution. The testimony of
Xione of them could be successfully Im
peached.
All of the witnesses agreed that there
were cells under the prison, which had
fecelved the name of "China" from the
lrmates. and still other cells were called
"Japan." â¢ These cells were under the
basement of the building; and the only
ventilation came from a little 8 by 3D
*"indow at one end. Rats and mice made
them a terror to the girls.
Jennie Beward. a former inmate, told of
fcaving been drapped upstairs by the hair
fey Miss Rhcades when on one occasion
She refused to obey the superintendent,
ftnd of having: been placed in "Japan"'
tor two days and nights with her hands
and ankles shackled. She also testified
that she had been under the care of a
physician as the result of injuries re
ceived by being knocked down stairs by
jklisF Rhoades.
Josephine Stafford testified that on one
â¢ccasion Miss Rhoades seized her by the
hair and jerked her to the floor. She was
Confined in "Japan" for eleven days and
had nothing' to eat but bread. The rats
Bad mice In the ceil badly frightened her. j
Important testimony was given by Mrs. j
Charles E. Coffin, for several years one
cf the board of trustees. She said she
hnd seen inmates of the school chloro
lormfd in order to keep them from ]
Â»^ :n::;;r and had ordered the practice j
.MJss Flora K>rr, formerly an officer of j
thf institution, toM of a little girl whom |
Jii^s Rljoades hed on the floor, her knees
on the child's back. She was twisting
one arm and ordered Miss Kerr to twist
the other.
TEI.LS OF THE WORK OF
GOLDEX Â«ATE ORPHAVAGB
PnreatleKÃ and Other Children at I.yt-
iou Institution Are Given Educa
tion and Training-.
A booklet has beer, issued by the Gold
Â«Â» Gate Orphanage, an institution under
the supervision of the Salvation Army,
entitled "With the Waifs and Strays." It
tells of the work the institution is doing
for orphans and homeless children.
The Golden G&te Orphanage is situated
at Lytton. Sonoma County, and was
formerJy known as Lytton Springs. The
plant contains tCO acres and there are
good buildings there for the housing and
caring of the children. There are at
the present time ninety children there,
but this number Is being daily In
creased.
Instructors and attendants look after
thr* welfare of the inmates. They are
riven prcrper schooling-. The boys are
taught farming, mechanical trades and
ether lines, while the girls are Instructed
In sewing, fancy needle work, tailoring
end other euch work.,- On the farm con
nected with the orphanage is a herd of
fifty cows, and with the farming it partly
helps to defray some of the expenses of
the institution.
The expence to maintain the Institution
is very heavy, and its existence depends
â¢freely on contributions of charitable
jy-^le who are interested In this work
mnd wish to give help.

LAWLESS MONKEY CEEATES
PANIC IN THE STREET.
Simian Resists Arrest and > Disturbs
the Peace of Fair Shoppers.
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE FEW MINUTES AN ESCAPED MONKEY
MADE ROUGH HOUSE AT THE JUNCTION OF GEARY AND" KEARNY
STREETS AT MID-AFTERNOON PROMENADE TIME YESTERDAY.
An escaped monkey Joined 'In the
promenade of holiday shoppers near
Kearny and Geary streets yesterday
afternoon and created a panic.
He was finally captured, through the
combined efforts of four policemen,
after putting up a desperate re
sistance. In the melee Policeman Col
lins was severely bitten on the hand
and the remainder of the posse detailed
to capture the "monk" were scratched
and lacerated.
Policeman Collins wanted to charge
the simian with disturbing the peace
and using profane language, but the
difficulties in transporting him to the
Hall of Justice were too great. The
animal was turned over to J. Dwyer,
an expressman, who was taking him from
the Third-street depot to the Chutes.
The monkey leaped out of the wagon,
dragging his chain after him, and
mounted Lotta's fountain. He search
ed In vain for a cocoanut.or two to
heave at his pursuers. Finally he de
cided that the fountain 1 was a new
fangled sort of palm tree and started
out in search of a good one.
A girl with a big hat attracted him
and he leaped upon her shoulder. He
tried to hide himself, in the tangled
foliage that topped the bonnet but the
damsel separated herself from the
headgear with a screech. The monkey
started up Geary street on a run. No
body tried to stop him. He showed his
teeth and jabbered dire threats In the
monkey language.
Meanwhile Dwyer telephoned to the
Hall of Justice and a posse was
hurried to quell the riot. When the
policemen arrived the simian was
mounted on a lamp post criticizing San
Francisco in a violent fashion.
Policeman Collins seized the chain
and pulled on it. The monkey needed
no second invitation to a flght. He
dropped down upon the policeman's
shoulders and they went at it hammer
and tongs. Three of Collins' comrades
came to his rescue and an attempt was
made to handcuff the monkey.
After a desperate battle the monk
was clubbed into submission. The
patrol wagon was rung for, but when
the little simian was being dragged
into it he resumed the fight. He seized
Collins by the hand and bit him sav
agely. Then he rushed back to the ex
press wagon from which he had es
caped and leaped into it.
While he was flagrantly guilty of
resisting arrest the policemen decided
that discretion was the better part of
valor. The simian was allowed to go
his way unmolested. Collins hurried to
a hospital to have the wound
cauterized.
Among the-, other casualties of the
monkey's raid were: One fat man se
verely Jarred by being upset by the
monk, two picture hats totally wreck
ed by the monk and one toupee ap
propriated by the monk from a man
who left the scene declining to give his
name. The owner of the toupee is said
to be "Mike". Fisher, manager of the
Tacoraa baseball team. ',

GRIDIRON GAME
IS DISCUSSED
Rules ; Committee Pays Heed
to the : Clamor r. Which
Has Been Raised Recently
CHANGES SUGGESTED
Will Open the Game and
Lessen tiie Brutality in
Evidence the Past Season
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. . 9.â The football
rules committee met to-night; with a full
attendance. ; A resolution was adopted
stating "This committee Is In favor of
action leading toward the opening of the
game and the lessening of brutality; the
placing of the officials In a central body,
and rendering an evasion of rules unprof
itable."
Tliis resolution was adopted after the
reading of suggestions offered by John
C. Bell, representing the University of
Pennsylvania. The suggestions,, which
were the only ones offered during to
night's session, proposed a* more open
game â¢by - strengthening the center and
weakenine: the ends of the line. _ They
were as follows: . '/ i '
\Flrst, the rules should distinguish be
tween unnecessary roughness and brutal
ity.' Brutality should include "slugtfng"
and "kneeing." ,
The penalty for these -offenses should be
disqualification of the guilty player until
the , end of the half, no substitute being
permitted to take his place; two jteuoh
disqualifications in a season to operate' as
a bar to such player's further participa
tion in 'any intercollegiate games during
that season. j V
The former "unnecessary roughness"
should include the use of "stralglit arm"
and '.'elbow offense," "piling up", and
other acts of a similar character.
Second, to bring more open play the
following changes are recommended: (a)
Forward passing, permissible back of the
line of scrimmage. .
(b) On defense there shall not be more
than six players on the line of scrim
mage; of the players back of the line
of scrimmage three of them | must be at
least five yards back of the line. The
remaining players back of the line of
scrimmage if within five ; yards thereof
must be inside of the position of the two
players on the ends of line of scrimmage.
(c) On offense the side^having the ball
must gain ten yards on three downs or
forfeit theball to the other side. ; .
(d) There should be an official board of
umpires and referees chosen iln | advance
of the football season and assigned to the
respective games by some duly consti
tuted authority.
STEANDED LABORERS
NOW IN CALIFORNIA
Greeks "Dumped" Into Keno
Are, Brought to Gold
en State.
RENO, Dec. 9.â The twenty-eight
Greeks who were stranded in this | city
the flrst part of the week as a result? of
tne work of . the. Atwood Eniployrrie/it,
Agency at Ogdeh were --taken away from
Reno last night: by Steve : Sdurapas, I ' a
deputy of the Greek Consul of San Fran- 1
clsco. They were . taken .to California,
where employment will be secured for all
of them. It seems that Employment
Agent Atwood; of Ogden succeeded in jget
ting a rate of $14 for every, man "over- the
Oregon Short Line from Ogden ' toVÃeho.
He then represented to the . Greeks, .who
were uneducated and trusted in him, that
they were to be sent to Oroville to get
employment. ' They rode this far on their
tickets and were put off here without any
Job or any money. The Greek consulate
is investigating the matter with the view
to bringing! suit for damages against the
employment agency. ?|^^

BOYS AND OFFICERS
WARNED BY INSPECTOR
Continued Front Page 43, Column 7.
ing t to their office,; the inspectors made
out a 'report recommending., a refusal of
license to go to eea. -That same day Cap
tain Weber -went to tne office in spite
of the oral, warnings he had received and
sought to obtain from Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger the needed license. In the
face "of \ the report made out by Guthrie
and Dolan his application was denied.
The next day; Friday, a few hours be
fore the explosion, Inspectors Guthrie
and Dolan- went again out to the ship to
see if their recommendations of the pre
ceding day were being carried out. It
was then that Mr. Guthrie refused to go
down with an open light and demanded
an electric hand light. One was given
to him and, he 6ays, it was the only one
on the ship. In the boilers were the lit
tle ' boya, striking the rusty sides with
their hammers, : and they - were using
candles for : light â¢ He warned them
strongly against doing so. . Upon return
ing to the deck he noticed that four large
manholes, built expressly, to ventilate the
tanks," were shut tightly. He ordered them
opened. They had ; been opened only two
hours when the explosion occurred.
GVTHRIB GIVES WARNING.
Inspector Guthrie said:
"I gave them -all fair warning both on
Thursday afternoon | and Friday morning.
There was a strong odor of gas about the
tanks j and boilers and I -immediately
scented danger. I asked for a closed light;
The captain gave me the only | one , they
had on board. When I came up I passed
out my warning and they all heard it.
"The unfortunate accident ! was the re

of affairs prevailed. Gas was being gen
erated as a result of leakage from the oil
tanks, and the captain was ordered to
put his ship into proper condition before
taking her out. : .
"At that time men were sent in to clean
the boilers and they saw the danger at
tached to the task. They refused to de
scend Into ' the hold until It had* been
thoroughly ventilated.- This was quite a
task to undertake at short notice, yet the
owners had to stand the expense and loss
of time before the men would consent to
go . into the hold to work.
"Again, the disaster might have been
averted this time had the captain taken
any pains to let fresh air into the hold
of the ship. On the top deck are four
manholes that can be opened. We found
these closed tightly on Friday morning
and I opened them myself. However,
they were not open long enough .to
thoroughly fumigate the hold. Had they
been raised a day or two before the
chances are the explosion would not have
occurred.
OVERLOOK AN OPEN DOOR.
"The poor lads who went into the hold
to work were not acquainted -with the
ways of a ship, for had they been none
of them would have been hurt when the
explosion . occurred. , At . the end of the
bulkhead in the boiler-room is a door
that is large â¢ enough for two men and
possibly three boys to go â¢ through at a
time. This leads down into the further
end of the hold and once in there the
lads could have easily made their escape.
"But they evidently did not know of
this and there was no one to warn them
of the danger. . A cool-headed man in the
hold could certainly have saved the life
of the little chap who was killed.-
. "In many parts of. the oil tanks I
found " the S rivets loose and the oil oozed
out through these holes in such quantities
as to generate a great deal of gas. We
ordered these fixed up before we would
issue a .certificate to the skipper. < Then
again, we found that a funnel \ that had
been used ': to fill the tanks with oil did
not connect flush with the pipe and here
more oil was spilled, so much in fact that
a five-gallon can was placed directly
underneath to catch the overflow.
"The owners -and captain of th& ship
were too eager to put out to sea and
tried \u25a0to do' things ' up in a hurried and
slipshod manner. That was the cause of
the fatal explosion, v Had they taken our
advice everything would have : come out
all right ~ though *it -. would : have â¢ taken
more time than they were willing to
spend."

ADVENT CHURCH CALLS
BERKELEY MINISTER
Kast Oakland Parish Offers
Pulpit to Bey. W. K.H.
Hodgkin.
OAKLAND. Dec. 9â The Church of
the Advent. East Oakland, after more
or less interesting experience with its
l*st two clergymen, has decided by a
unanimous vote of the vestry to extend
a call to Rev. Wilfred Reginald
Haughton Hodgkin to become Its rec
tor. The call is "being thoughtfully
considered, and. it is believed by all
friends of the Advent, will be accepted.
The Church of the Advent is situated
In a part of the city that is rapidly
improving and is naturally a strong
parish, with a congregation composed
of people of wealth and 6oclal distinc
tion. With a clergyman who will give
attention solely to building up the
parish, it is thought that a great work
can be done. The edifice is one of the
best equipped in the diocese, as well
es one of the largest. A magnificent
tteld Is offered for the man who can
unite all the elements of the parish to
do a 6plendid work.
Rev. Mr. Hodgkin is a graduate of
the University of California and the
Church Divinity School of the Pacific,
Fan Mateo. He was ordained deacon
in ISO* and priest at St. Mark's Church,
Berkeley, In May last. For nearly two
years he has been curate of St. Mark's
said has acquired the respect and con
fidence of that cultured congregation.
The Rev. Mr. Parsons will regret the
loss of an able assistant If Mr. Hodg-
Jcin decides to accept the calL All the
Berkeley influence is against a change,
but Mr. Hodgkin will go to the new
charge if. In the opinion of the Bishop
his duty calls that way. A decision
will be reached in a few days.

OAKLAND, Dec. 9.â After forty-eight

bÂ«*?n unable to clear the mystery sur
rounding the death of a young man whose
body, with a bullet in the head, was
found half-submerged on the rocks of
the Viroad gauge mole Thursday after
noon. Fully Impressed with, the fceilef
that the man was murdwetl the Oakland
department has enlisted the assistance
cf the San Fiancleco detectives in the
case- ' '
Though hundreds of persons, men and
v-omen. have viewed the remains at the
Morgue, not one of them has been able
to Identify the corpse. The only clew
found on the clothing was . a . laundry
mark, which h*r co-far failed of reeult.
Joseph Koehlf of Tracy had a number
identical with the one on the' dead man's
collar. But Koehler is alive.
Coroner Mehrmann has ordered the body
held as long as possible in the hope that
It may be t<3er.tified before Interment shall
be neccs&ary. An Inquest will be held,
but the date has not been set.
Convinced that the case is one of mur

COMMISSION BEGINS TRIAL|
OF CHIEF ENGINEER BALL
Head of Oakland's
Fire Department
â¢ Before Board.
Property Owners Say
Engines, Arrived
Late at Blaze.
Battalion Chief Con
ian Asserts Action
Was Prompt.
OAKLAND, Dec. 9. â Charges against
Chief Engineer N. A. Bali of the Fire
Department of incompetency in hand
ling a lire that destroyed the larger
portion of the block bounded by ' Sec
ond, Third, Washington and Clay
streets, were heard by the Police and
Fire Commissioners this morning, but
owing to the absence of several wit
nesses the nnal hearing went over till
Wednesday. ..
The principal witness- against the
Fire Chitsf is F. Is- Matthews; manager
of the Bay City Iron Works, .which was
destroyed in. the rire. There were about
eighty others ;who signed the. petition
to bust the Chief, but several of these
withdrew their names to-day, declar
ing that they .knew nothing about the
fire. Among these was C. G. McAfee
of the Peerless Manufacturing" Com
pany, who sent the following explana
tion:
"Chief Ball: In regard to my signa
ture attached to the petition to oust
you from your office as Chief of the
Fire Department I wish to say â¢ that I
did not read the petition, and, being
very busy at the time, signed it to get
rid of the party who presented it.
"If I had read the petition I should
positively not have, signed â¢: it. aa I have
no 111-feeling against you or the way
you have managed the department, . .
"Hoping that this will be a sufficient
explanation, I remain, respectfully,
M C. G. McAFEE."
City Attorney. McElroy, a member of
the board, stated that V. A. Dodd and
A. Fish, also signers of the petition,
had called upon him and said they.
knew nothing of the handling of the
fire.
The principal, witnesses to-day for
the prosecution, which was represented
by Attorney E. C. Robinson, were
Robert Brand, whose machine shop at
621 Third street was destroyed, and H.
A. Longfellow, a coal dealer at 620
Third street. Both" thought the Fire
Department was tardy in arriving and
putting lines on the names. C. C.
Pease, an employe of the Empire Foun
dry and one of the petitioners for the
prosecution, admitted that the depart
ment responded promptly, but testified
that the firemen were slow in. getting
to work. â¢ . .\u25a0'\u25a0."â¢
For the defense George E. Randolph
of the United Iron Works, who turned
In an alarm, testified that Chief Ball
arrived on the scene not more than
seven minutes later and Immediately
turned in a general alarm.
The chief witness for the. defense
was John J. Conlan, battalion chief of
San Francisco, who testified:
"I arrived when, the firewas raging,
but it was under perfect control. I saw
the extent of the fire, and, judging
from my observations and knowledge
of the surroundings, I thought it was
a well stopped flre, especially on the
Second-Btreet side. Had the fire been
in San Francisco â¢we would have had
twenty-eight streams on the. blaze,
with nineteen first-class engines." *
Chief Ball stated that there were no
firstHclaes engines in Oakland, and the
hearing was continued at Robinson's
request. Attorney A. Jj. Friclc. who repÂ»
resents Ball, making no objection.

NEW LABOR LAW
DECLARED VOID
Police Judge Smith Holds
Measure Restricting Work
of Children to Be Invalid
ORPHANS' SUFFERERS
Magistrate Says There Is
â¢/ Discrimination Against
Those Who Must Toil
OAKLAND, Dec. 9.â Orphans and aban
doned, children shall not be. discriminated
against by the lawmakers of this State,
according \u25a0to ja . decision I handed ! down by
Police Judge Smith to-day. _ Judge Smith
was passing upon the demurrer of Attor
ney M. "C." Chapman against the com
plalnt8 i charging Fred Becker, a well
known'meatmerchant. and member of the
Butchers' Board of Trade, with violating
the law j passed by the last State I^eÂ«ris
lature restricting child. labor. . â¢ . .
Judge Smith held that the new law waa
unconstitutional and invalid in that It dis
criminated against orphans and others
who must either earn their living, be de
pendent upon charity or starve. . He up
held Attorney Chapman's contentions in
nearly every particular. '. \u25a0/'.: . -,
Sevaral months ago Henry. Thompklns,
a ,13-year-old, 13-year-old boy, was killed In an ele
vator, accident at Becker's meat market,
and after making an investigation State
Labor Commissioner Stafford caused the
arrest 'of Becker on ( two charge*. The
first charge was employing a child under
14 years, of- age without . proper creden
tials, and the second was employing a
child under 16 years in a dangerous ca
pacity. To both of these;. charges Chap
man demurred, on the ground that tha
new law was not constitutional. Chapman
cited many authorities, and to-day Judge
Smith sustained the demurrers. In de
claring the law uncomtitutional Judge
Smith said in part: * \u0084 . -
"The law. must bear equally on. all with
in' the class to which it applies. This act
was Intended to favor : and protect the
child, and not the parent, and. under this
act if the parent be suffering from . aick
ness or disability the child, subject to
certain, conditions, is permitted â¢to .work
in order to aid himself . But under no
condition ' is the orphan*' the abandoned
child or the child who cannot read or
write allowed to labor, but must depend
upon charity or starve. Hence the statute
discriminates between \u25a0 certain \u25a0 children;
The statute to be constitutional must
treat all children between the ages of 12
and 14 alike. -This \u25a0 the statute
does' not do. \u25a0 In-other w6rds;-undor cer
tain restrictions children ; i having a parent
and 'children attending "school 'may be
employed under . certain conditions, while
others not having parentsior. not "attend
ing school are not permitted to, work. It
follows, therefore, that the present act is
unconstitutional and' void. .
â¢ "\u25a0\u25a0 "The other- complaint the de
fendant with a public > offense } fails .to
state such offense - In: ordinary? and con
cise language, or at all. but conclusions
of t law only are. stated s! therein, and for
that reason _ th^.demurrer^must } be sus
.tAlrHftd.'and. also tlils;' statute, like the
other, Is void, and .unconstitutional. ,
.'.'There : are. many; other and further
reasons why ' the' demur rers^ in each of
these, cases, should;- be sustained.- but < 1
deem i the above : sufficient to justify j me
in sustaining the demurrer In each of said
cases." ' \u25a0.'.. /.- '.\u25a0'\u25a0. .- . : ;

Residents of Sausalito Ask
Trustees to Give Water
Front to Promoter Evans
DO NOT WANT ANY BOND
Resolution Adopted at a
Monster 'Mass; Meeting Is
Favorable to New Lino
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I SAUSALITO, Dec. 9.â "Grant a fran
chise to F. L. Evans without' a bonus or
| a bond" was . the message . sent to the |
| Town Trustees by one of the largest mass- |
meetings ever held in the Town Hall this
evening. The meeting was called for .the
purpose of , considering the delayed ac
tion of the. board of Town .Trustees and
discussing the advisability of granting
the franchise with or without any con
sideration. The I sentiment was unani
mously in favor., of granting it without
any bonus "or bond. -
Attorney George H. Harlan was chair
man of the meeting and Alban E. Wray
secretary. Upon the request of Chairman
Harlan, F. L. Evans,, who is promoting
the California and Inland Empire Rail
road, explained his position.-. He said:
' "I am asking for a fifty-year fran
chise for the outer 150 feet of Railroad
avenue at present . covered with water. In
the event '\u25a0 that ; work la , : not commenced
within one year and the construction of
a terminal here and 200. miles of standard
gauge railroad completed , within three
years, the franchise will be revokable by
the Town Trustees. Car and repair shops
will be located within a 'mile and a half
of the town and the terminal headquar
ters will be here! I do not mtend to-block
any other road and intend to have stops
at the eastern end of Railroad < avenue.
Railroad avenue at low. 1 , tide is covered
by a foot of water, and* I will dredga it
deep enough for large seagoing vessels,
the dredffings to be utilized for filling in
the space between the northerly line of
Railroad avenue an the North.! Shoro
tracks." ''\u25a0 ' â¢
* Francis Avery. a.' prominent citizen,
said: "If there Is no cesspool caused by
filling In. 1 1 am' in favor of granting the
franchise."" * . \u25a0
â¢ Andrew Westwater said: '"Let me give
you a straight tip. -Give it to them.V
Oscar F. Meldown.Town Attorney, said.
"I am heartily in favor of granting : the
franchise, as I believe It means much to
Sausalito. The matter, however, is in the
hands of the Trustees."
A. E. Wray, secretary of the Sausalito
Land and .Ferry Company, said: "The
voice. of the people demands the granting
of the franchise without bonus or bonds.
I bolieve in the sincerity of Evans and
know that fortune is knocking at our
door. Let it In. It may be twenty-five
years before It knocks again."
Among the others who spoke in favor of
the franchise were: P. B. Nagle, Mr.
Haynes, F. 3. Baker, Valentine Britton
of Â»I.ir Valley, W.E.-Lewls of Waldo
Poinr. Paul Vincellonl. Donald H. Fry, A.
E. Roberts and Archibald B. Murray. Â» â¢
; - In response to a motion ot P. B. Nagle,
Chairman Harlan appointed A. E. Rob
erts, P. B. Nagle, Joseph H. Perelra, W.
E. ,Lewis and Fred LJnsley to frame a
resolution voicing the sentiments of the
meeting. They presented a resolution ex
; pressing -and. . declaring in the most un
\u25a0 equivocal terms that the Trustees grant
i the franchise without bonus or bonds.
The resolution was adopted unanimously.
The committee will be present at the
meeting of the Trustees, next Monday
evening to support the resolution.
â¢ The Board of Trustees 'is almost unan
imous in the belief . that . a J50.000 bond
guaranteeing. good faith and from 575,000
to 1100,000 bonus should be asked, as the
member* believe the franchise is a valu
able one. They feel that other munici
palities have been moved by mass-meet
ings to grant valuable water front, only
to regret the move at a later date.
The California and Inland Empire Rail
road Company will be incorporated for
$70,000,000 in Arizona, and will build a line
from Sausalito to Caspar, Wyo., with a
branch to Eurjka, if the plans of Evans
are successful. !

The students who interviewed the Palo

The pair that visited the sorority house
met' with a more congenial fate. One
meagerly attired youth was given a

cake. His companion, who had on his
oldest clothes and a sweater, sought an
interview with Dr. Moulton and attempted
to discuss the football question with the

WILBUR, Wash., Dec 9.â While com
ing from a tunnel on their mining claim
on the Colville Reservation about twenty
two miles from Wilbur, Leshe Heady and
Gus Pearson were fired upon from am

Heady * managed to "'crawl' back to "the
tunnel 'and remained there till the moon
rose* when he came -Into the open and
made his way to a \u25a0 settlement â¢on the
Columbia River five miles away. 'He was
so faint from the loss of blood that it re
quired nearly twelve hours for him to
make the trip. -; He will probably^ die.
Heady saw Pearson fall and left him fpr
dead. \u25a0 A rescue party found Pearson In
a weak condition in the canyon. He was
nearly dead from loss of blood.. One of
the wounds - was close to his heart, and
it is believed this will prove fatal.

PARKER'S NEW STORIES

Novel for Harper's and
Begun Upon Short Tales
Sscd&l Dispatch to Tha Call.
LONDON, Dec. 9.â After trying in^
vain for three years to persuade tÂ£^|
authorities of the Oxford and Cam<
; -bridge University presses to consent to
tha omission from reprints of the au
: thorlzed version of the Bible its . ful
! aome dedication, to King; James, Ray.
Dr. . Dawson Burns appealed to tha
"Christian public" a few days ago to
assist him in getting these authorities
to "yield to the force of reason, and re
flection." The appeal has been success
ful. Dr. Burns, who is an orthodox
clergyman of considerable standing,
has. just announced that the consent
has been given.
Aa Dr. Burns points out, tha actual
James, the first, ot England and tha
sixth of -Scotland, was tha direct op
posite of the belauded James ot the
dedication. Jamea was not a "moat
high and mighty Prince."- but a low,
mean and despicable one. He, was. not
"King of France," as tee translator*
style him among other things. . He waa
not comparable to Elizabeth as "the
sun in his strength" to a "bright Occi
dental star." His coming to the
throne waa not a "great and manifold
blessing" but a national calamity, and
hid "hopeful seed" filled the land with.
confusion and bloodshed. Instead of
"many singular and extraordinary
graces" James had not one ordinary
, grace of body or mind. He had not one
attribute whioh the epithet "kingly"
is Intended to express, w '
"He was." adds Dr. Burns, M * coward
by temperament and a tryant. by dis
position. He sacrificed Raleigh to JJVfe
vengeance of Spain, and hU despotf*"^
would have sacrificed . those . liberties:
which England had preserved, despite
Norman feudalism and the Wars of the
Roses."
There is some excuse for the authors
of the Inflated eulogy of King Jame9. In
those days it waa the proper thing when
indicting an epistle to a monarch to give
him fulsome praise. But there Is abso
lutely no excuse for the retention of the
"Epistle Dedicatorte" nowadays. The
Bible Society for the last twenty years
has rejected H. Apparently the society
considers it unsulted even to the spiritual
diet of a Tamil coolie" or Tonsan
islander. -.'.'v~.
PARKER A RAPID WORKER.
Sir Gilbert Parker has taken such an
active part in politics of late, both in and
.out of Parliament, that one would have
supposed he would have had no time
lÂ«t for literary work. On the contrary,
he has accomplished a good deal. He has
'almost finished the long novel"watco was
commissioned by the Harpers, a year or
more ago, having now only halt a dozen
chapter's or so to complete, aod haa also
started on a new series of short storie3.
These deal with life on the prairies and
mountains of Northern Canada.
-\u25a0 BOOK OX EARTH'S PROGRESS.'
There has just been published in Lon
don, at the stiff price of one *uinÂ«a, or
five dollars, what must.be described aa a
truly remarkable book. Handsomely il
lustrated and sumptuously "gotten up."
it might well be, instanced as a spectmen
of what manner of stuff the publisher of
to-day can be induced to print were it
not for the extreme likelihood that Henry
R. Knipe, who is responsible tor the work,
haa also borne the various expenses con
nected with its appearance. \
"Nebula to Man." as Mr. Knipe 'eamf
his work, takes the form of an epic, poeS.
and is nothing leee than an attempt to
describe the evolution of the earth from
chaos to cosmos. It begins tn thfa palae
ozoic ages. when, of course, there wero
some uncommonly strange members of thÂ»
animal . kingdom in existence. Into the>
habits and. pursuits of. these Mr. Knipe
goes deeply, and in case any one doubts
his authority so to do. he has given in
an appendix to his book a list of various
awe-lnsplring works which he studied be
fore writing. These Include "Catalogue of
Fossil Fishes." "Textbook of Palaeontol
ogy" and "On the Evolution of - the
Probascidea." and what good use Mr.
Knipe made of their contents we see.
when he gets to describing the BUurtaa
period. For thU3 |he epic: â¢?
Along the ihare sand-hoppers tn*rry rise.

period, and meet some most unpleasant
creaturesâ on land this timeâ notably thÂ«
stegosaur:
Upon his hack are bony plats* laspl*atÂ»d
That look like rows of tombstoas*. Kn*!l and
t -\u25a0 â¢lanttd.
Says Mr. Knipe. and then goe* on calmly
to an even more Impressive beast, a* fol
lows:

corded by the author, who says:
SeÂ« laelapa here. daab.ing likÂ« kangaroo
At.nartJroeaurs, .tall, and massive, 100. -
But whether the triceratops also was %
fighter we ars not told. Mr. Knipe de
scribes him thus:

And monarch walks of what he does survey.

The epic ends with the "final retreat

' NEW YORK, Dec 9. â The market to
day was ragged and irregular until the
appearance, of the bank statement dis
closing the deficit in the legal reserves,
when : a buying of- great
animation and enormous volume devel
oped and carried prices up with a re
sistless sweep. Just in the final deal
ings there was some rather, wild
.throwing off of holdings to realize
profits. \' The result was an unsettled
and irregular / closing. At one \u25a0-\u25a0 time
during, the short session 'the "market
was uniformly weak and considerable
losses showed all through the list. The
upward; rush of prices after the ap
pearance of the bank statement was a
striking: demonstration of the power
of tho organized speculation In the
markeli The explanation commonly ac
cepted of the movement was as a dem
onstration of a positive conviction of
coming relief of the money market.

The current, discussion on this snb-
Ject assumed that the banking: position
disclosed by the clearing-house state
ment presented a position which the
Secretary of the Treasury ha 3 stated
as contingent upon his taking action
to relieve the money. stringency.
The rushing -up of stocks on this
assumption represents a speculative
maneuver of some violence. Of the
bank statement Itself some skepticism
was expressed over the showing- ! of a
decrease in the loans in. view t of the
course of the. week's stock market. The
loss in cash of $7,546,100 was in excess
of â¢ expectations, j .Foreign \u25a0 exchange
moved up strongly. . Continental ! ex
changes also moved strongly against
London and a rise in the official dis
count rate of the Imperial Bank of
Germany on. Monday : was regarded as
possible. Paris was j reported to be se
curing gold in the London market.'

features of the market, the last rushing

"HE H-E-A-R-S"â A prominent citizen's testi-
mony: â "My ear was for years TOTALLY
DEAF to the very LOUDEST spoken words;
LAST THURSDAY Rexradlo quickly made
Jt DISTINCTLY HEAR sentences in an OR-
DINARY voice at TEX "FEET distance, to
my great surprise and delight. (Here is the
testimony of the prominent WITNESSES: â
"WE WITNESSED MÂ»\ Koblneon's HEAR-
ING (as above CORRECTLY described),
while his GOOD ear was securely CLOSED."
Signed. W. G BURKE (the eminent LAW-
YER, recently elected CITY AND COUNTY
ATTORNEY): H. Clements. 330 Pine {the
well known PRESIDENT of the I. C. GOLD
MIXING CO.). and others.") On SATURDAY,
(yesterday) my hitherto TOTALLY DEAF ear
HEARD sentences WHISPERED at a dis-
tance, and spoken In a natural voice at thu
great distance of FORTY-TWO FEET. The
elect City and County Attorney WITNESSED
this. As a further test Attorney Burke closed
my good ear to make sure It could nothear,
and then, as before, I clearly heard sentenced
v spoken and WHISPERED. I consider this
QUICK and LARGE benefit VERY MAR-
VELOUS. I am delighted. Up to this time
all physicians and remedies entirely FAILED
to help me. I will ANSWER all LETTERS
gladly. â William Robinson. 1101 Golden Gate

results in TOTAL DEAFNESS are continual-
ly being made, and any une can come and
SEE the cures being made. LAST WEEK a

of simple DEAFNESS) clearly HEARD
and . intelligibly . SPOKE . many . WHIS-
PERED words, as WITNESSED by the be-
fore mentioned Attorney Burke, President
Clements, C. Engleke and many others.
NOTE THIS: â Rexradlo has never failed to'
promptly benefit the VERT WORST cases if
TOTAL DEAFNESS, ana DEAF MUTEISM,

them up as HOPELESSLY INCURABLE. A
subject of severe GENERAL RHEUMA-
TISM, who could only slightly raise the feet.
WALKED slowly and with short steps, TES-
TIFIES: â "After ONE short treatment I feel
as if I had NEW LIMBS, and I have easily
RAISED each foot THREE FEET HIGH,
then freely RAX and JUMPED, which I
could not do before." WITNESSES testi-
mony to the above: ' "The above is' COR-
RECT. We saw it ail. Signed : Attorney
Burke; President Clements. 330 Pine; C.

Some Mechanics' Institute
Members 1 Warmly Oppose
Uniting; Two Libraries
HEALY IS EMPHATIC
Says That the Mercantile
People Are and Always
Were "Kid Glove" Bunch
The fur flew at the meeting: of the MÂ«
chanlcs' Institute members last night
when the motion to indorse the actions
of the board of trustees in regard to the
consolidation of the Mechanics' i Library
and the Mercantile Library was' brought
before the gathering. After outbursts of
pyrotechnical oratory the* meeting ad
journed with the. issue still "up in the
air."- . - . \u0084.> . ../ ; :..\u25a0: -.; ;<\u25a0 .'. ; ;.
Bitterest in denunciation of the move
was P. J. Healy. He referred to the Mer
cantile Library members ag "the kid
glove bunch." "What have we honest,
horny-handed mechanics, tp do \u25a0 with
these?" he demanded.
The retort of Joseph Rothschild, a mem
ber of both libraries and an ardent sup
porter of the consolidation*; proposition,
was equally torrid. "Perhaps there are
many of these kid-gloved aristocrats. who
do not care to associate with. Mr. Healy
or anytof his kind,'.' he said.' \u25a0'"".
J.. C. Saulman waved a cane In :the
air as he denounced the business methods
of the Mercantile Library. "It would.be
a poor business proposition to take them
in and incorporate their ..name* with' that
of the Mechanics' Library," he asserted.'
Supporters of both sides applauded each
speaker and the one hundred ,or more
members present displayed the . liveliest
interest in the question. The opposition
called the consolidation a "white ele
phant" scheme and harsher names.
"It is ah excellent thing," began Healy,
Ironically, "to take these people in on
thÂ«s ground floorâ an excellent thing for
them. Wo would then have 500 privileged
members-^5OO who have' always belonged
to the kid-glove population. " This Mer
cantile institution raised ' s2so,ooo, ' as has*
been said, by questionable means. After
that it was uriable~to continue business.
"\u25a0What have we honest, horny-handed
mechanics to do with these. Shall we
allow them to : foist *a lot of old books
and their respectability upon us and to
rule over us. This is what we will do
if we follow the , action of our board of
trustees. , These 80,000 volumes would only
be an extra care and confusion' to us.'
"Let us vote down this proposition and
rebuke our over-anxious . trustees." -
Joseph Rothschild was quick to rise in
the defense of the trustees and the mem
bers of the Mercantile Library. "There
were 128 of these whom Mr. Healy has
called the kid glove bunch," who did not
vote for consolidation," he said. "They
did not want to associate with Mr. Healy
or any- of his kind. S I do not think that
there is any objection to aristocratic la
dies and gentlemen coming into this li
brary."
"Is the gentleman speaking: as a mem
ber of the Mechanics' Library or of the
Mercantile Library?" demanded one of
the opposition.
The debate threatened to last all night, :
when Rothschild came to the rescue. He
; introduced a resolution approving the I
work of the board of trustees, with the
proviso that . a committee .of five, be ap
pointed to meet a like committee from
the Mercantile Library and make a re
port, at a special meeting called " for the
consideration of the consolidation propo
sition. This resolution was adopted, only
a few dissenting.
."By that time,*' observed the \ pugna
cious Healy, "they may take a hint from
the temper of this meeting and not want
to come in."
Nominations were opened for the elec
tion of the new board of trustees, to be
held in February, and the meeting ad
journed.
