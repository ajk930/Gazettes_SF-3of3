Collins Is Again
Indicted for
Felony.
Mrs. McCurdy Arrives
Safely Within Can

Story Published in The Call
Enables City Police to
Locate "Her.
"After reading the exclusive story
in this Morning's Call regarding
the flight of Mrs. Sarah A. Mo
Curdy on last Sunday night, I
conferred with Chief of Police
Dinan and we sent a message
to Chief of Police J. M. Lang
ley of Victoria asking him if he
had seen Mrs. McCurdy. As
a result we received a telegram
from him four hours later stat
ing that the woman was there
in company with Collins and
his wife. . The first information
that Â»vc had concerning the des
tination of Mrs. McCurdy came
through the columns, _ of The
CalL"* â Statement by Captain of
Detectives Joseph J. Burnett
yesterday afternoon. *
An Indictment charsringr George D.
Collins, tbe allrgea blsanvlitt ivho end
ed Ms aensatlonal fllgrht from Sam
Francisco last Tuesday by registering
Tilth his companion, Clarice McCordy,
at the Hotel Driard, British . Colombia,
with perjury, wai returned lÂ»y. . the
Grand Jury during: a cession held yes
terday afternoon. Realizing- that the
runaway lawyer could not be extradit
ed on the charge of bigamy that stood
against him, . but determined that the
man should be punished In some man
ner, this body, acting under the ad
vice of District Attorney Ilyington, de
cided to bring in the indictment for
perjury. This was quickly accom
plished and the order for his arrest
signed at once by Judge Lawlor.
The offense for which the warrant
was Issued was alleged to have been
committed In the proceedings before
Judge Graham by Collins by his sworn
answer to his real wife's suit for main
tenance. In this paper he said that
lie was never married to Charlotta Eu
genia Xewman, .while witnesses and
the marriage certificate in his own
handwriting prove that he was.
Detective Thomas Gibson will hurry
north to-morrow afternoon in order to"
take any necessary steps to hold Col
lins until the extradition papers ar
rive. Acting Governor Anderson of
California has already wired to Wash
ington for the necessary documents,
but it la likely that much time will be
consumed before they reach Victoria
and can be served. Gibson will watch
the prisoner and as soon as possible he
will escort him back to San Francisco.
MRS. McCDBDY WITH COLLINS.
la the meantime Mrs. Sarah A. Mc-
Curdy, the Chicago mother-in-law,
whose disappearance completely baffled
the police of this city until The Call
discovered the facts of her escape and
published every detail of the flight
toward her, soa-ln-law and daughter
yesterday mornlne*, has arrived at Vic
toria. Acting- on the Information pub
lished in The CalL Chief of Police
Dlnan telegraphed to Chief of Police
I^ang-Iey of Victoria, and in the course
of the afternoon he received the reply,
that the mncb-Â»oiiRbt noman was safe
In British Columbia* with the rest of the
refugee*.
George D. Collins, under arrest in
Canada, has already begrun technical
steps toward the securing: of his re
lease. He was defeated In his first
move, but be has. many more surprises
left for the courts before he -'will sub
mit to be carried back to the United
States a prisoner.. The following tele
gram shows what steps will have to be
taken by the San Francisco authorities
before they can hope to secure the
escaped lawyer:

Twelve More Deaths From
Sunstroke the Day's Record
In the Metropolis. â¢
EpÂ«clal Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK. July 13.â Twelve deaths
were reported in New York to-day as a
result of the continued heat and* exces
sive humidity. Thirty-six new cases of
prostration were sent to the hospitals.
Physicians report an unusual number
of children ill in the tenements and pre
dict great mortality among invalids and
feeble persons, if the enervating weather
continue. : , . . : "\u25a0,'-\u25a0\u25a0>.
While showers in the middle of the day
brought temporary relief, the atmosphere
seemed even .more moist and oppressive
when the sun came out again and official
forecasts at midnight gave little hope of
any immediate change. :
Lewis Ehlols of -Newark ended his life
with gas to stop his sufferings. He was
66 years of age and lived with his little
grandson. For several days he had com
plained of the heat and told the little boy
that he could not ; stand it. much ' longer.
This morning be bade- his grandson, an
affectionate good-by; telling him he was
going to his room to 'prepare for a long
Journey. Two hours later the police broke
open "the, <lo6r" and r< iliscdvered * the" aged :
man lying on the bed; .with -a , gastube
between his, lips.. A note addressed to
his \u25a0 .grandson " - said that -the > heat- had
driven him to self-destruction."", :": ." '
Lorenzo Bailee,' aged 16, of Hackensack,
In a fit of desperation from heat suffer
ing, Jumped into, the Hackensack River
and immediately, sank to the bottom.
Peter -Sheedy crept to the roof of the
house to get fresh air and went to sleep
TTy the side, of a, chimney. Some tremor
of the - building , dislodged a - large - cap
stone ton the" chimney, which j fell : upon
his head,. .killing him. \u0084
It was the humidity accompanying the
heat that made existence distressing. The
wind, continuing in the south and south
east, brought the moisture â¢ from vthe
ocean and gave Manhattan Island the at
mospheric conditions of a Russian bath
steamYoom. ,
Although cooler breezes were felt to
night, heat victims continued to pour In
to the hospitals and | physicians and at
tendants complained of being nearly worn
out.
PRESIDENT FISH
MUST PAY BILL
Head of Illinois Central
Is Ordered by Court to
Settle for Wife's Furs
NEW YORK, July 13 â Stuyvesant
Fish, president of the Illinois Central
Railroad, is compelled by a decision
handed down by Justice Delahanty of
the City. Court to pay Adelbert Jaeokel,
furrier,- a Judgment of- 11600 for -furs
sold to his wife. Justice Delahanty de
nies an application made, by Fish for
a new trial. .; ; \
Upon trial Fish testified that he does
not allow his wife any income, since
she has one of her own,: derived from
her/private investments, but that he
paid the house bills. He: said he some
times supplemented his .wife's Income
by presents at Christmas. :"
Justice Delahanty says that ; a hus
band Is bound to furnish his wife with
clothing suitable to, his and her condi
tion and station of life.. So long as the'
marital - relations ; exist he may be re
garded by tradesmen as . assuming the
obligations cast upon him by law. The
Justice continues: , sJSESSCSSMsQH^OBBBI
"I place little stock in the claim that
Mrs. Fish is alone liable herein because
all transactions In connection with. the
purchase of the goods In question. were
carried on with her personally. It . Is
conceded that the. defendant never;no
tified the ' plaintiff , not to furnish his"
wife wlth,,such articles or, that he

ALBANY, N. V., July 13.â Public clamor
for an ' investigation -of . insurance com

and volume. : The Governor and his
cabinet; composed 1 of ; Collector of Cus
toms Stranahan,, / Superintendent; of In
surance ' Hendricks,, Superintendent of

demand for J such : an f inquiry. - All - prac

factions in .the ; Republican \u25a0\u25a0: party are
urging,, the Governor^ to V send < a :.' special
message to ;the ; Legislature ; creating a
small joint commission to Investigate not
only the Equitable, but, all insurance
companies ' and to make a report to the
riext . Legislature, "embodying suggestions
for more ' satisfactory laws."

HIGGINS TURNS MUTINEER.
; â¢ The .Governor, whose ."back , has been
stiffened", by: his cabinet, is beginning to
show indications of ; a- revolt against i the
dictates of his party. f He declaredr to
day that he had not . changed his opin
ion regarding s the Equitable situation.
When -; asked if it i were true that I the
statement given out recently, by ex-Gov
ernor. Odell in favor < of immediate legis
lative Â» action , was; not inconsistentiwith
the latter's attitude . during their ;" recent
conference '- on .the- Equitable report, the
Governor^ replied: /. \u25a0'â¢: :
"I would prefer that you put that ques
tion, to Governor^ Odell."
The Governor added: "Nothing has oc
curred'up to this hour that leads me: to-
believe ' that . legislative action is neces
sary at this \u25a0 epecial session. "
Attorney General Mayer and Governor
Higgins had a conference to-day to map
out a; plan* of action - against Equitable
officials charged by Superintendent Hend
ricks with having, diverted Hhe funds";or
the society, to their own use. .It Is under
stood ithat' radicals action will be taken
next- week, andU also that the Attorney
General is looking- up the law, ' with
a ; view to compelling , restitution to \u25a0 the
Equitable Society of ; money ; made ; out
of transactions in Union Pacific prefered
stock. . Recent facts in connection with
that deal 1 show that the; syndicate .or
"James fH.: Hyde and ; associates" bouna
the .Equitable Society to hold the stock
in . pool . f or .; five j years. I :, It iis a \ question
whether this' condition is binding on the
company, now, or if Schiff ' or,' Hyde \u25a0 can
be held responsible for the negotiations.

while the majority of the citizens of. Nor

Defense.

VICTORIA, B. C. July 13.â GÂ«orge D.
Collins, the San Francisco lawyer and
bigamist, arrested here on a warrant Is
sued at the instance of the San Francisco
police, charging perjury, applied to-day
10 Mr. Justice Lampman. through H. D.
Helmcken. K. C. to discharge him
Irom custody, alleging the warrant upon
which he was arrested was defective.
Frank Klggir.s. who was retained to rep
tesent the San Francisco police authori
ties, applied for a remand for a week,
when the case was brought before Mr.
9ust!eÂ£ Lamr>man this morning.
Mr. Hclmcken, in opening his defense,
*ai<l the court could quash the warrant
It had issued on being sliown that â¢ the
information it was based upon was not
tufflcipnt. The Information was that the
accused was suspected of having com
iniued perjury under Section 118 of the
Â§>nal Code vf California. The informa
tion, he contended, was wholly insuffi
cient. He ouoied from the case of the
People vs. Turner, a California case In
>vhlch perjury was charged, in which
the uro^ocution had failed because of the
insufficiency of the information, which
did not state the perjury was willful.
The willfulness of the false swearing
mutt bo proven. It was not sufficient
to swear that the perjury was falsely,
feloniously and maliciously committed,
\u25a0u-ilLulnet-s must also be shown. He
quoted from Taschereau to show an in
ciclmcnt had been dismis?ed b2cauÂ»e the
word feloniously had been used instead
of willfully. The omission of the word
willful. Mx. Helmcken contended, was
fatal to the warrant. After quoting sev
eral California eases, he asked that the
charge ago.ir.st Collins be dismissed.
Then. Mr. Helmcken said, his client was
a member of the California bar, and
asked the court to hear him. as he would
endeavor to make the case clear.
COLLINS ADDRESSES COURT.
Mr. Justice Larapraan expressed will
ingness and Collins addressed the court,
life said that where an offense charged
is aii offense against the extradition
law it is necessary to show the offense
to be one against the laws of both
States, and it therefore becomes neces
sary to have an understanding of the
lnw of perjury in California. If the of
fense did not constitute perjury under
â¢the laws of California, it was not pun
ishable in Canada. He quoted the case
of the People vs. Turner in California
â¢ and went on to show that the charge
of perjury in the southern State must
be cliarged af willful. In the informa
tion before Mr. Justice LampTnan no
ettcn-.pt was made to charge this state
ment alleged to have been made by him
as willfully made. True, the warrant
read that the statement was feloniously
and maliciously, but not willfully made.
The Supreme Court of California In the
case of the People vs. Turner stated
that perjury must be willful. The ex
tradition law. lie held, went deep, right
to the base of the substance of the of
fense. He held the offense charged
did not constitute perjury, according to
â¢ the laws of California, and therefore
was not an offense within the purview
of the extradition law. Furthermore,
he said, there can be no perjury ac
cording to California law unless the
statement alleged to be falsely made is
material to the case. While it is not
tiet^ss&ry in Canadian law to show that
perjury is material, it is in California,
and if a false statement was irrelevant
it would not constitute perjury in Cali
fornia, although it might in Canada.
Further, no allegation of perjury was
made in the information on which the ar
rrEt was bas^d. nor was tt shown that
the- alleged perjury was made before a
court having jurisdiction. Information as
to whether he had been sworn was also
omitted, and again, the information upon
tvhleh the warrant was based nerely
ftaterf that he. Collins, knew th<Â» state
rm-nt alleged to have been falsely made
to be falseâ it was not an allegation of
perjury. N*o attempt was made to show
the statement was falseâ that he knew it
to be feloniously false.

Asserts. That Mrs. McLurdy JLaid the
Trap That Caused His Ruin: ?
Witness Tells of the Chaos That Pre
vailed in Luxurious Home.
Recent developments tend to place the
crime of George D. Collins, attorney
charged with bigamy, among the more
remarkable of the many offenses that
j have been committed against the peace
! and dignity of the people of California.
They also prove that he has drunk deep
ly from, the bitter cup of woe since he
took the step that has probably ruined
his career To friends, Just before he
started on his flight from the jurisdiction
of the court, he said he had but one per
son to biamj. He' found excuses for him
seif and for Clarice McCurdy, but at the
mother of his illegal bride he pointed the
linger of accusation and said that his
ruin was the result of her ambition. She
wanted him tor a son-in-law, he said, and
she got him and when she had, she was
aware of ail the charges that hud been
made that he was a married man. For
himstlf he ottered the excuse 'that; the
fumes of wine had crazed him and \ the
soft carrcÃses of his bride to-be lured
him. A few weeks passed and he, sat
and locked at his bride, his brain clear
of alcohol, his mad passion cooled. Then
the folly of his act swept over him and
in three. weeks more his hair had gather
ed the whiteness of a decade, his should
ers were stooped and he stood a wreck
of his former self, fullof the knowledge
that he was lost. r,-r~ - â¢
TERRIBLE SCENES IN HOME.
And from the luxurious home where he
took this woman for whom he had fallen,
and the woman he blames for It all, Mrs.
S. A. McCurdy, there comes a story that
savors of the madhouse. First with the
wineglasses clinking over the flower-be
decktd table and then stamping the halls
and gnashing his teeth in his rage at his
fate, Collins kept what he called his
borne in an uproar, sometimes all day;
sometimes all night. One that was there
and saw it all gays the scenes were piti
ful.
"Collins made a terrible effort to face
his trials fearlessly," said this guest at
the home, "and at times tried to cheer
us up Sometimes as late as midnight
he would ask us to join him in pleasure.
The Chinese cook would be prdered to
prepare a repast. -Flowers and wine and
all the luxuries of the culinary art were
spread before us. Collins would joke and
laugh and the wine would flow and the
cigarettes would burn. Then when the
wine took hold, his rage would start.
Many a time he damned Mrs. McCurdy;
ordered her to eat in the kitchen and told
us that he would be willing to suffer all
if God would only let him get rid of
â¢that old woman. that was his nemesis.' , ,
"He raged through the corridors;' until,
exhausted from his efforts, he sat down
to watch Mrs. McCurdy take her daugh
ter by the arm and lead her to a-pri
vate chamber they both; occupied. Col^
lins always went to a rear room alone.
He was robbed, he said, of. even .the
pleasures he should at least expect would
be the reward of his crime. But Mrs.
McCurdy ruled him.
TRIES TO SAVE HIMSELF.
"But all of Collins' woe is the result
of one act of indecision on his part.
Several years ago he met Mrs. and Miss
McCurdy when they came to his office
to seek his services as their representa
tive in a will contest. After a year or
so he felt that he was slipping into"
their clutches. One day he called a
clerk, handed him a bundle of legal
papers and said: 'Take these to -Mrs.
McCurdy.- They are the papers in her
litigation. Tell her I do not wish to
have anything more to do with her.'
"If George D. Collins had stood firmly
Chief of Police, and did not show_ the
Jurisdiction of the court, whether he,
Collins,' had been sworn or whether the
statement was material to the case, and
he argued that the warrant for the rea
sons Fhown was void. He cited a case
in the Californian law records in which
a person for whom a warrant was sought
for murder had been released on it being
shown that the. Information upon which
the warrant was secured was given on
the officer swearing that it was his opin
ion the crime had been committed, and
so in this case, he argued, the warrant
was both insufficient and defective.
Hlggins said he had an authority
which he could . quote in the case of a
Swiss for whose arrest and extradition
a warrant had been secured on a charge
bearing upon bankruptcy proceedings.
In that case it was shown that It was
not necessary to go intp the particu
lars of the offense. \u0084 It was sufficient to
specialize the crime alleged. It was
clear that the warrant must specialize
the crime. Crimes for which accused
persons could be extradited were in two
classes, those which could be described
and those which could not, unless ' at
length. The law- authorised a general
description of the offense. For the pur
pose of the present prosecution It was
sufficient to allege perjury In the war
rant; that was all, that was necessary.
KEPT IN JAIL AT'MGHT.
Judge Lampman said he would grant
a remand. Accused and his counsel had
argued that it was necessary to bring
such allegations as could secure
viction under the laws of California.
Mr. Higgins' authority had been Jtufn
dent to show he had Jurisdiction It the
case was proceeded with and that* the
warrant was sufficient. .He thought
eight days a little long to \u25a0 remand "; the
caee. ' however. . A remand was finally
granted for six days.'. \u25a0\u25a0'.-.'.. l ':'.'' , :
Helmcken sougiu to have ' an y arrange
ment made to allow ICollins to remain
at his hotel; with a Epecial officer, ..whose
expenses would be paid by; the . accused.'
It was finally arranged, by permlsslon'of
Chief Lang-ley, that he could be given
his freedom . in the daytime,' but) would
be taken into the "custody of the city
police at nightfall.
Mrs. McCurdy, the mother-in-law of
the fugitive attorney, arrived here this
mornlngr She wen. straight to- the
hotel where Collins and his wife are
registered/ She steadily refused' to be
interviewed. The hasty trip s from ; San
Francisco was hard on her and she was
nervous and exhausted.'

by that resolution he would still be a

But the clerk had no "sooner "reached
the corridor, than Collins called.? him
back. 'Leave , those papers ;. here,' 1 ; i he
said>/I will take them to Mrs. McCurdy

STARTED ; FOR MEXICO. ; ; \u25a0
"That Canada : instead . of Mexjpo en
joys- the distinction of Collins* pres

On the 4th Inst. Collins made r up his
mind to escape to Mexico, covering his
purpose by. the announcement that - : he
intended going to Los Angeles to at-,
tend to some legal business. "It was his
intention 'to desert Clarice. and>her
mother. /He summoned; an< automobile
and when it drew up at the house he
tossed in a grip, climbed In with the
chauffeur, and , called two of his clerks'
to the curb. He did not, look at the
clerks and tears were in; his eyes. .:'.
â¢â¢ 'Boys,' he said, 'I do not believe any
of my clothes will .fit you. i but if they
do, take 'them. My. linen, "i collars 'and
cuffs, of which you will find many, you
can have. Divide them among you.
Good-by.' Then the auto sped , away.
But .on reaching Los Angeles; Collins
experienced a change of; heart arid .re
turned., He 1 ,, told me that after -he\ had
reasoned out' that flight would be a
confession of guilt and still belleve.d he
had a chance of. beating the indictment,
he "decided to return and fight it out;
He did return and reopened the fight
for liberty, but' when he saw that con
viction was inevitable, he again decided
to flee.
"The day he declded.to.flee he tele
phoned . to Pratt & Tlerney's notorious
resort and arranged . wi^h them
to secure the services of " .'Bogle'
O'Donnell as engineer of an auto and; a

went to the water front and took the

train hurried th<nn- from the jurisdic

SYRACUSE, N. V.. July 13.â State In
surance : Superintendent Hendricks to
day was asked as to why reference to
the Depew Improvement Company, and
its exorbitant loan from the Equitable
Life Assurance Society was not con
tained In the preliminary report of his
investigation of the society's affairs.
Hendricks said:
That was ancient history. We had son*
Into that before. WÂ« told . them (the society)
to call the loan. -We marked the valuation. of
the property down to 9130.C00, They kicked
on that and we told them that tt we mada
any change It would bÂ» less. They then fore
closed the mortgage on the property, bid It In
for $50,000 and they have it yet.
Hendricks also replied to the com-*

Strange that the newspapers, could get

to-day that Ryan's ambition was to be

in the steps' "of Senator' Daniel. The
ambition of the. financier. has been, on
the surface, primarily to be financial

where his residence is still kept in a

r* URIE CO. *APPOINTMENT OF DE WITTE ENDS
HOPES OF THE RUSSIAN WAR PARTY
Emperor Nicholas* for
mal , announcement of
the ;- appointment \u25a0of
Sergius de : Witte as
peace plenipotentiary re
moves the last doubt as
to Russia's sincerity in
the coming negotiations
in Washington. The
St. Petersburg war par
ty has given up the
struggle for a continu
ance of strife with Japan.
It is felt that Dc Witte
will obtain better terms
for Russia than any
other man would be
able to do.
Czar's Sincere Desire for
Peace Is Doubted
No Longer.
Great Statesman Likely
to Obtain Best
of Terms.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 13.â Emperor
Nicholas has announced the appointment
of M. de Witte to be chief plenipoten
tiary, representing the Russian Govern
ment In the peace negotiations to be con
ducted next month in the United States.
33m appointment, which was signed after
midnight, clothes M. de Witte with plen
ary powtrs.
Official information of the designation
of M. de Witte to head the mission was
forwarded to Washington this morning.
M. de Witte will take passage on the
North German Lloyd steamship Kaiser
Wilhelm der Grosse, which will sail from
Cherbourg on July 26.
Tne peace party is overjoyed at the
fact that negotiations have "been placed
In De Witte's hands. It is firmly believed
that this not only insures -a successful
termination of the negotiations, but that
De Witte will obtain the best possible
ttrms for his country. Some of the grand
dukes and courtiers of the Emperor's en
tourage, however, are reported to be furi
ous at De Witte's selection.
Sergius de Witte, the Russian plenipo
tentiary, may be regarded as the leading
liberal statesman of Russia. For the
last thirteen years he has been one of the
strongest personalities in the Russian bu
reaucracy,- although his political fortunes
fuffere<J"a. i -setback when he was compelled
to resign the portfolio of Minister of Fi
nance in August, IJ*C3, and again when,
after being appointed president of the
Council of Minsters, in the same month,
his office gradually lost its importance
until rumors of his intention to resign
ana gc abroad had been persistently cir
culated.
De Witte Ss about 56 years of age and
has steadily worked his way up from a
position of an underpaid railroad clerk,
v.-ho occasionally acted as porter, to that
of the loading statesman of Russia, in
fcpite cf ihe fact that his enemies are nu
merous and include some of the most
pov.-erful men in Russia. A man of
large stature, big limbed and muscularj
standing more than six feet in height. De
Witte has the reputation of being harsh
to his subordinates, but his honesty and
ability have never been doubted, even by
his urorbt enemies. He was created a
Count in 190 L
De Witte is thoroughly familiar "with
the Far Eastern question in all its bear
ings. He understands the Japanese posi
tion and fully realized "before the war
that the aggressive policy being pursued
under the lead of Viceroy Alexleff and
Brzobrazcff, president of the Yalu Tim
ber Company, and the coterie of adven
turers connected with them, would drive
Japan to take up the sword. At one time
De Witte talked over the situation with
the Marquis Ito, president of the Japan
ese Privy Council, and one of the leadir/g
statesmen of Japan*. Practically it was
Dc Witte's disapproval of Russia's Far
Eastern political policy and the creation
of a vice-royalty in the Far East which
caused his downfall as Minister of Fi
nance
TREPOFF TO SUCCEED BOUXIGAN".
Warned bj- Terrorista That He Will Be
Slain In Hta Own Room.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 13. â The
resignation of M. Bouligan as Minister
of the Interior Is expected daily. Gen
eral Trepoff, thÂ« assistant Minister of
the Interior, probably will be his suc
cessor.
The terrorists have renewed their
warnings against General Trepoff with
ominous persistency. The general is in
constant receipt of letters signed by the
executive committee of the fighting
organization, informing him that his
hour has come. A- remarkable feature
of all the communications Is that the
writers take pains to say that no safe
guards will' avail to avert his impend
ing doom. At the same time they tell
him he need not be afraid to go abroad
in the streets. They add:
"Your sentence -will be executed in
your own room. You will die in your
bed." v;Â» : , ;
The terrorists \u25a0 seem \u25a0 to take: pride in
issuing a challenge Involving a demon
fetration of their power and resources to
penetrate the armor of < the police. -
Moreover, General Trepoff knows
enough of the desperatenessof the or
ganization to firmly . believe that the
terrorists are able to - execute . their
threat. ' He makes no concealment of
the fact that- he expects to be killed,
but his nerve is unshaken.
"I will at least.. die at the post of
duty." he Bays. - â¢ - '-â¢â*
Privately General Trepoff takes a
gloomy view of the future of the autoc
racy, in which he. believes.-:' The gen
eral is confident that if given untram
meled power he could restore the old
status quo in a year, but the' present
vacillating policy, he believes, . will end
only in ruin. , A representative" assem
bly, no matter what' its initial charac-,
ter will be. he is convinced, will, soon
be transformed. Into -a: constituent as
sembly whlch,will; give the death-blow
to absolutism.' ' * *': ' '.\'.'~J,' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 " ItT

ODESSA, July 13.â Twenty-four
leaders of the recent disturbances here
were hanged to-day in various prisons.
Another batch of twenty-seven will be
publicly executed upon the arrival here
of General Ignatieff. The battleship
Georgi Pobiedonosetz has arrived here
with a fresh crew for the purpose of
taking the mutineers to Sevastopol for
trial by court-martial.
Of 202 persons arrested and charged
with robbery or incendiarism in con
nection with the recent riots, seventy
four were acquitted to-day owing to
lack of evidence and twenty-eight were
sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment,
the time to include the two. weeks
which they have already spent in pris
on. The extraordinary outcome of
these trials has aroused much com
ment hefe. It Is openly asserted that
it is a political demonstration: against
the military Government and furnishes
evidences of the conflict going on be

ASSASSIN IS IDENTIFIED.
Murderer of Count Shouvalofl a Former
Siberian Exile. .
ST. PETERSBURG, July 13.â Official
advices received by the Minister; of the
Interior this afternoon say that the as
sassin of Prefect of Police Shouvaloff
of Moscow has been identified as a for
mer school teacher of St. Petersburg
named Kulikovsky, who Is actively
connected with : the political agitation
and is believed to have belonged to the
terrorist organization^ He was first ar
rested under the administration of the
late Interior Minister; Sipiaguine in
1901 and three years ; later was exiled
to Siberia for six years by the'latoiln
terior .Minister yon Plehwe, but escaped
in 1904 and was supposed to have gone
abroad. Kulikovsky was next discov
ered at Moscow in June last prowling
around the Government buildings,' pre
sumably intent- upon committing a po
litical crime. He was arrested and
taken to a police station : from, which
he escaped. Shouvaloff offered a re
ward for his recapture and set all the
police of Moscow at work; .
The prisoner, in the meantime shaved
off his beard and while the .police
were searching for him everywhere ] he
went to the. Prefect's office'and-com
mitted the crime for which he wlllnow
be tried. The bullets of the revolver
used by the prisoner were filled 7 with
poison.

which has been classed by art critics as
a masterpiece. The painting is on ex

self to painting and his success has been
remarkable- He was born in Vilna, Rus

He received his diploma from this aca
demy at the age of 21.
After making his escape over the Rus

The Smell of Cit I em.
Some sensitive essayist should: take the
smell of place as subject. Paris, for ex
ample, is highly pervaded with the odor
of burning^ charcoal, , and," coming ftom
Paris . to London, one is newly assailed by
the appeal of soot. Cologne has a repu
tation, long undeserved, for smells other
than that of its famous "water," and -it
has been said that, in years of old a
blind man could find ; his way . about \ Co
logne by following his nose." ; Moscow has
an odd perfume of ,its own. It suggests
cranberries of peculiar pungency. And It
never leaves the nose, f Garlic,- of course,
:is the basic smell that greets the stranger
who lands at Calais. But the most cur
ious of smells of place is that of \u25a0 St.
Petersburg. J The present writer jg often
wondered .what j it ; was,' . having detected
it even between the sheets of his bed at
the most exorbitant hotel. On -his | third
t visit , he wasdriven in a drosky. from the
station with ; a" fresh Â» young -,- English girl,
â¢ who had never; been away from Kent be

asked. ' "Yes,"; said the. girl. "Old boots."

TEAM CONTRACT
Street Committee Hears ill
Evidence and Decides New
Contractor Is Competent
UNSA2OTAEY CONDITIONS
Refuse Creating Stench* and
Menace to Public's Health
Soon to Be Carried Away
The dirty streets which have long been
a menace to the health or the city are
to be kept clean. Yesterday at a Joint
meeting the Supervisors' Street and
Finance committees decided to let A. B.
Clute retain the contract for providing
teams to the city for $4 48 per day, in
spite of the protestations of the Board of
Public "Works. A provision imposed upon
Clute, understood In all contracts. Is that
he do the work of hauling the refuse
from the streets as well as was formerly
dene. As It was agreed that the wagons
employed at present are insufficient in
size for the adequate carrying out of
the contract and It was ordered that
larger ones be provided.
While this seemingly endless contro
versy between the Board of Public "Works
and the Supervisors' Street Committee
was being carlred on, the condition of
the streets of this city reached a de
plorable state. The conflict is one of
authority and a disposition of the Works
Commissioners to block the system by
which the streets may be kept clean. The
Btreet Committee decided that it was
within its power to enforce the present
contract and if the work is not satisfac
tory the Board of Works may report
that fact. -
The Works Board etill maintains that
the retarding of the street cleaning Is
due to the inability of Clute, who was
lately awarded the contract to provide
teams for the removal of the sweepings
by the Board of Supervisors. The evi
dence of Superintendent of Streets Cow
den yesterday proved conclusively that
the fault is not with the contractor, but
with the inadequate size of the wagons
used. 1 .. .
The 'efforts of the commissioners to use
the testimony of the witnesses examined
for furthering their end was detected by
Chairman Braunhart and be refused to
let Eagan ask questions in several in
stances. Several times Commissioner
Eagan expressed a desire to see the con
tract by which Clute was given, the
right to furnish the teams, saying that
he wished to know Just what the Board
of Works was expected to enforce.
Chairman Braunhart had the contract
read, which in no way satisfied the com
missioner.
"We will not discuss the validity or
legality of that contract," said Braun
hart. "The Question for us to decide is
whether Clute 'can do the work as well
as it was formerly done and at a much
lower rate."
The witnesses who were examined to
determine the character of the work done
by Clute's teams were Superintendent of
Streets Cowden, J. K. Copus, district
foreman of. sweepers, and J. F. Clute,
representing. A. B. Clute. They made it
evident \u25a0"^Eat* Clute has not" had a" fair
chow or a sufficient trial It was stated
that about six days' sweeping was left
by 1 the former contractors for the new
teams "to gather, up. Earring the wagons
employed by Clute. Cowden said that the
present contractor was able to handle
the work easily.
The friction between the committees
and the Board of Works was evident
and amusing in several Instances. 1 Chair
man Braunhart asked Cowden if the
Clute teams were as good as those hired
for $6 a day. "Let's put that question
as It ought to be putâ intelligently," as
serted Eagan.
Maestretti claimed that the Supervisors'
committees had no right to take the
award of the contract out of the hands
of the Board of Public Works. A final
vote of the Street and Finance commit
tees, placed the matter in the hands of
Clute at the lowest rate, as awarded by
the Supervisors, with. the understanding
that he procure wagons without, flaring
tides and of a capacity as great as j those
cf the former contractors. .While waiting
to procure these conveyances of refuse
it was ordered that Clute furnish enough
wagons to do the work properly at his
own expense. " '

Periodic
Pains.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
are a most remarkable remedy
for the relief of periodic pains,
backache, nervous or sick head-
ache, or any of the distress-
ing aches and pains that cause
women so much sufferings
As pain -is weakening, and
leaves the system in -an ex-
hausted condition, it is wrong
to suffer a moment longer than
necessary, and you should take
the Anti-Pain Pills on first in-
dication of an attack.
If taken as directed you may
have entire confidence in their
effectiveness, ?s well as in the
fact that they will leave no dis-
agreeable after-effects./
They contain no morphine;
â¢ opium, chloral, cocaine or other
dangerous drugs.
"For a long time I have suffered
I greatly \u25a0with epells of backache, that
seem almost more than ' I can endure.
These attacks come on every * month,
and last two or three days.- â¢ I : havo '
never been able to get anything -that
would give me much relief until I be-
began the use of Dr.' Miles' Antl-Paln
Plls, and they always relieve me : In a

The admiral's present mission abroad
is to study the '\u25a0: modern naval , problems
and conditions with a view of applying
them at home in a plan, now under way,
to reconstruct the '* Chilean navy. ' From
here - Montt and Banker von- Buren 'will
go to the Orient and later to England and
Italy. Few. men : in 'South America .have
gained the . distinction of Montt and ' his
tory does not tell of a man who has been
more ' deeply loved by tvs countrymen
than the little admiral of ' Chile. It Is
generally understood among, the people
of Valparaiso that- Montt's present': trip
is mainly for the purpose .of absenting
himself from home during .'the â¢ coming
elections with a f view jof preventing : his
re-nomination for/the -Presidency,'"' a-, posi-'.'

enough. '

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
REFUSES FINAL
DIVORCE DECREE
Judge Ogden of Alameda Su
perior Court Takes Staud
That Surprises Attorneys
HE IXVITES MANDAMUS
Denies Biifus B. Page Sepa
ration From Wife Because
He Is Defendant in Case
OAKLAND, July IS. â Notwithstand
ing that thu law says that either party
lo a. divorce may ask for the entry of.
a final decree after the require year
has elapsed after the granting of the
interlocutory decree, 'Judge Ogden this
morning refused to sign a deciee for
Rufus B. Page of San Leandro, stating
that he was opposed to make entry at
the request of the party against whom
the decree has been entered.
"The man must come into this court
with clean hands before I wi!l give him
a decree and I will suffer mandamus
proceedings before I will sign it." was
the way he expressed himself this
rooming.
The unexpected action of Judge Og
den in this matter has brought about a
peculiar state of affairs. He is the only
Judge on duty at the present time dur
ing the court vacation and Page is an
old man and seriously ill and he is anx
ious to have the tinal bonds holding
him to his wife severed, for should he
die she could dimiss her divorce pro
ceedings and claim a widow's share in
his estate. '"\u25a0- -.ââ¢::
She is at present in Alaska. An ef
fort was made to get City Attorney Mc-
Elroy, heT representative, to ask for
the divorce, but he refused. In this
quandary the attorneys for Page must
either make Judge Ogden sign the de
cree by Supreme Court mandamus or
wait for one of the other Judges to
return from his vacation.
GRASSHOPPERS ARE
CAUSING DAMAGE
Hundreds of Thousands of
Dollars Lost as Result of
Plague.
BERKELEY, July 13.â Professor C. M.
Woodworth. entomological expert of the
agricultural college, to-day returned from
a tour of the district infested by grass
hoppers. He bas worked unceasingly for
a month in an endeavor to check the
ravages of the pest and has met with a
measure of success. He reports, however,
ih&t the damage done by grasshoppers to
crops in the district extending from Hop
land to Hollister and Tehama to Merced
\u25a0jvlll aggregate hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
Never in the history of the State, says
Professor Wood worth, has such a plague
cf grasshoppers visited the region in ques
tion. Entire vineyards, orchards and
growing crops have been ruined by the
army of "hoppers." Professor E. TV. Hil
gard'e theory is that the excessive rain
fall of the last winter made it possible for
the insects to propagate in greater num
bers than before.
CONTINUE THE FIGHT
OVER NIORO ESTATE
Arguments Heard as to Va

OAKLAND, July 13.â Arguments at

The arguments were not concluded and
the matter went over until August 9.
APPRAISERS DISAGREE.
OAKLAND. July 13.â Appraisers of
the estate of the late Mendell Welcker
of Berkeley fi'cd a report to-day. In
which two state the- property is worth
561.700. while the third flics a report
or his own and says the estate is worth
J225.700. The property consists main
ly of ft piece of land on the water front
in Stockton known as the Terminal
Tract, and it is upon the value of this
piece that tUe main disagreement
coiiies. It I* valued by the majority
at $59,000 and by the third at $225,000.
The appraisers are Otto Grunsky. R.
E. Wllhoit nr.d Prank H. Powers of
San Francisco, and In regard to the
great disparity between the valuation
placed on the land \V. T. Welcker said
to-day: 'Mir. Powers has been" closely
connected with the estate for years,
and known the real value of the land.
The valuation; placed upon it by the
two appraipers looks to us as ridicu
lously low,' aoÂ«l 1 cannot Imagine upon
what sort of n. basis they arrived at
such a flgrure."

\)\\. WAKD DISCUSSES
CONDITION OF COWS
Expert 3lakes Statement lle-
Tuberculosis in
Dairy Herds.
BERKELEY, July 13.â Dr. A. R. Ward,
of the agricultural department of the
University of California, to-day issued
the following: statement In connection
with ' Health Officer Reinhardt's attempt
to make the dairymen of Berkeley sub
mit their herds to the tuberculin test:
Dairymen In general labor under the im
pression that thÂ« physical appearance of a
cow is an index of the \u25a0 general health of ' the
animal. From time out of mind dairymen
have judged the health of their animals I by
their appearance. Acting in accordance with
this standard I believe that the majority of
dairymen- conscientiously maintain herds of
dairy cows apparently healthy ' as far as they
: can determine. â¢. . - v -
Unfortunately there Is a disease most
alarmingly prevalent among dairy cattle that
can be recognized but rarely by the appear
ance of the cows. I refer to tuberculosis."
which is commonly called consumption when
etiectinr man.
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease which
is aiTorded exceptionally tavorable opportunity
for spread by the conditions under which dairy
cows are kept. The onset of the disease is
unnoticed. With reference to this Leonard
Pearson. State Veterinarian of Pennsylvania,
88]'!!:
"Tuberculosis begins in nearly, all case*
within the body hidden from view and maj
reach a remarkable development without seri
ously disturbing the functions of any of the
organs of the body. One of the most striking
and Important Tacts in regard to tuberculosis
la that it may exist to a dangerous degree
for a long time without producing signs of
Illness or even loss of condition."
Cr. V. A. Moore of Cornell University
writes :
"Tuberculosis is a disease .of very slow
progress. It often requires years for It to
destroy Its victim. The tubercle bacilli mul
tiply and penetrate the organ in which they
were first carried and gradually destroy ; It
â¢ \u2666 â¢ From what has Just been said about
the course of the disease it is perfectly clear
that there may be large numbers of animals
In a herd that are affected with tuberculosis,
but which may be perfectly sound. There
are two ways in which the disease can be
detected, namely, by physical examination and
with tuberculin. - The physical examination
(judging by general appearance) Is of value
In advanced cases only, or where the diseased
part is in evidence, <as for example, the
lj-mphatlc glands of the neck. Experience has
shown that by this method > one Is unable :to
find more than a very small percentage of
animals that are tuberculous and a menace
ts the healthy cattle. This method lÂ» a very
crude one and cannot be trusted â¢ except in
the very advanced 'ca,Â«es 'and in those where
the early stages of Ihe - disease are in Â»; evi
dence externally. The tuberculin test iÂ« far
more reliable. There have been many u/jjust
things said about tuberculin and many cattle
owners , have come to fear that it Is a dan
gerous agent to uee. It has been " found,
however that tuberculin â¢Is as - harmless as
need be to the health of the animal. ,./:;,'
â¢ "All those who have worked with tuberculin
have agreed that ; It . Is one of \u25a0 the safest ; and
surest tests in detecting the presence of tuber
culosis that is known to the medical world." -,
" The test has withstood for ten \u25a0 years the
constant onslaughts of prejudice and Ignorance,
but Is to-day officially recognized and used
by the governments, of the United States,
Gr.*at Britain, France. Orrmany, Argentina
and others. :
The lsÂ»ue in Berkeley Is clean cut. The
herds < are so thoroughly Infected .- with tuber
culosis that . the dairymen . object \u25a0to the'-use
of : a diagnostic . agent capable of , indicating
the diseased cow*. They insist \u25a0 upon | the use
of antiquated methodn of- physical: examina
tion notoriously Ineffectual and wmlpbs. . They
do not wish to go to the root of the matter
and wÂ»e4 out their diseased animals. " They
prefer to go on from year to year.. culling out
their consumptive, cows' as' fast < as : they . be
come emaciated from the ra vages. of the.dis
ease. I^SSi^SKS^^w^*'''': \u25a0';:".

HOLD GARBAGE
LAW IS VALID
Justices of Supreme Court
See No Merit in Claims
of Oakland's Scavengers
OPINION IS UNANIMOUS
Municipal Legislators Are
Thoroughly Justified in
Passing of the Measure
'Th Supreme Court haoded down a de
ctsloQ yesterday upholding the Oakland
garbage ordinance. The plea that the
measure In , question was special legisla
tion'ls held not well taken. The opinion
is signed by all of tha Justices. Antone
G. Zhizhuzza and . Alasandro Gughlmlni,
the scanvengers who were arrested with
a view to testing : the law, are remanded
to tha custody of the Sheriff.
Tha matter cama before tha Supreme
Court on petitions . for writs of habeas
corpus. Tha important section of tha
garbage ordinance over which there has
been so fierce a legal battle reads as fol
lows:
The city of Oakland, Us duly authorized
ajrents. tervants or employes, shall hayÂ» thÂ»
exclusive right to gather and collect garbage
within . said city and it shall be unlawful for
any person, " firm or corporation. â¢ except ' aÂ»
otherwise provided In this ordinance, to collect
or gather garbage within said city.
f The ordinance then describes what shall
be considered as garbage. . fixes the rates
and prescribes the penalty for violations
of the act. . The scavengers objected
strongly to having their business taken
away from them and immediately insti
tuted legal : action. They have been de
feated at every turn. \u25a0__ â¢\u25a0 '
They claimed that the law was dis
criminating and unjust to the owners of
private houses in that tha rates were
fixed in proportion to the distance neces
sary to be traveled by the collector of
garbage. The court thinks such a plea
should come from the householder and
not from, the scavenger.- . , â
Justice Van Dyke is the author of the
opinion.-"

ASS A ILS CRITICAL RIVAL
IN THE GREEN ROOM.
"Every morn I bring thee viol-lets,"
chanted Miss Bertha Hererra from the
stage of the Empire Concert Hall.
"Gawd," exclaimed Miss Lottie Tal
bott, a rival cantatrice in an audible
whisper. "Don't do it if it hurts you."
j Miss Hererra heard , the caustic com
ment upon her efforts, but continued
the ballad. . She responded to a vigor
ous encore.'
"I cannot sing the old songs," she
chanted sobbingly.
"Sit down." advised Miss Talbott.
"You never could."
But Miss Hererra valiantly continued
to assert that she was unable to sing
the old songs. .
"Take a cough drop, kid." suggested
Miss Talbott just when the top of a
high note was reached.
Miss Hererra ceased to warble for
an instant and leaned over the - foot
lights. "When this turn is over, Lot
tie Talbott, I'll meet you In the green
room and I'll break your face for
you." â¢
"Aw, come out of your trance. You
couldn't break nobody's face," retorted
Miss Talbott
Hurriedly and angrily Miss Hererra
ran through another song and then
she ran to the green room. Her ruffled
feelings did not permit her to throw
the usual amount of pathos and feel
ing into the song and it had fallen
rather flat.
Miss Talbott was Just making over
her features for her turn when Miss
Hererra blew In like a cyclone. "This
for you," shouted the injured cantatrice
and landed on Miss Talbott's eye.
Max Haas, proprietor of the theater,
extricated the critic from a. tangled
mass of lingerie make-up, wigs and
curling irons. One of Miss Talbott's
blue orbs was a delicate shade of green
and black at the end of the round./
The coloring. was so pronounced' that
Miss Talbott was unable to render
"Only a Splinter From My Father's
Wooden Leg." Whereupon Manager
Haas discharged them both on the spot.
When Bertha's case was called be
fore Judge Conlan she announced that
she and Miss Talbott had kissed and
made up. "We are going to double up,
me and Lottie. We've got a new song,
'Only a Convict's Daughter,' and we're
going on the road with it."
"Sure, that's right. Judge," said Lot
tie. "I kidded her a littles too strong
and I guess the wallop was coming to
me. It's all right. Judge. We're pals
again, all right, all right. We wears
diamonds all right if we stick to
gether."
v When Judge Conlan dismissed the
case the rivals left the courtroom arm
in-arm.
Because his brother, A. X. Perfaktes,
threatened to make him eat some of
his own candy, James Perfaktes had
him arrested for threats against life.
The brothers had it out in James'
confectionery shop. .A.. X. . Perfaktes
entered the place filled with the spirit
that imbued his ancestors at Marathon,
He was as full of fight as Marco* Boz
zaris in the third reader. James I had
flim-flammed him out of $10 worth of
icecream and he wanted gore,
James saw him coming and shied a pan
of peppermints at him. A. X. hastily
intrenched himself behind a show case
and bombarded his brother with marsh
mallows. When that ammunition - gave
out he sent a volley of gum drops that
made James lie low.
For nearly a half hour the place waa
full of flying chocolate creams and
French mixed. Seeing that bis brother's
position would have to be stormed James
seized a mass of molasses candy and
made a flank movement. He brought the
sticky mass down on the head of A. X.
and the war was over. : While A. X.
was extricating the, molasses from his
features James called In a policeman,
and had his brother arrested.
Judge Conlan continued the case until
July IS.

SINGLE TAX AND RAILROADS.
WE recently commented upon some of the features iÂ» a cam
paign for "public ownership of railroads, by a gentleman who
is in California as a single tax lecturer. He has since in
formed us that private ownership of land and of railroads are special
privileges, and both are condemned by the single taxers.
Without going deeply into the philosophy of property, it may
.* be said that property of any kind exists only by the assent 'of so
* ciety. If society say that land shall not be private property it
ceases to be so.' Therefore if real property or any other form of
* property be a special privilege it is given by society and for the
social good. The franchises of railroad property are granted by
â¢ \ society and for its good. The issue in what is called public owner
ship of railways and denial of private ownership of land is, Will
it be better for society as a whole? Whenever society decides that
It will be better, the change will be made, and private ownership of
land will cease and public utilities will pass into public ownership
* and operation. The question is, will it be well and wise for society
:to decree this change? We say no. The single tax lecturer says
yes, and the issue is joined.
The single tax lecturer in his letter denies that Government
can control railroads, because the Dartmouth College decision
stands in the way and he demands a reversal of that decision and
* public ownership, instead of public control. . The Dartmouth Col
* lege case was decided in 1819, Chief Justice John Marshall writing
r. the opinion of the Supreme Court. Dartmouth was an eleemosynary
corporation founded by Mr. Wheelock as a charity school, and put
under perpetual franchise by the King in 1769. It was supported
from the estate of its founder and such gifts as were bestowed upon,
it. The Legislature of New Hampshire in 1816 amended the college
* franchise and in the language of the act, "Enlarged and improved
the corporation." The college resisted this amendment of its per
petual charter or franchise, and in due time the issue reached the
Supreme Court of the United States, where it was argued for the
college by Daniel Webster and for the^State by William Wirt, At
torney General of the United States.
The decision was in effect that the franchise vested perpetual
rights in the corporation, which could not be increased or dimin
, ished without its assent. It is probable that John Marshall never
dreamed that his decision involving the rights of an eleemosynary
corporation, under a franchise granted by the King of England,
would ever.be held to apply to business corporations, organized for
profit and benefited by the right of eminent domain, but such ap
plication was held to be correct until it was decided otherwise by
the' Supreme Court in the Granger cases. The decision is not re
vers*ed in its application to Dartmouth, or any eleemosynary cor
poration. But is held inapplicable to a" kind of corporation that was
not in existence in 1816. We give so much space to it because
it is evident that the Dartmouth College case is to figure largely in
*; ihe arguments of the socialists, single taxers and politicians for
public ownership.
The lecturer whose statements cause this exposition denies that
railroads can be subjected to public control, but on his next page,
in discussing watered capitalization, says : "This is being shown
' by the stock and bond law of Texas, under which roads are not
permitted to recklessly issue securities. The Southern Pacific owns
the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad and was forced to can
\u25a0 â¢ eel $1,356,000 of bonds and reduce its capital stock from $5,000,000
to $1,000,000."
k Now that looks to us like very effective public control. By,
an act of government it compelled a railroad to reduce its capital
* izatkm from $6,356,000 to $1,000,000. To a reasonable person it
appears that if government can reduce the capitalization of a raiN
* road by more than 75 per cent, and compel the cancellation of se
.curities already issued, those who despair of Government control
and demand public ownership must have been born to despair. .
* Our purpose is to promote exactness of statement in this dis-
fcussion. The lecturer defends the high capitalization and high
Â» . charges on European railroads, and praises them, because they "do
not kill thousands on thousands of human beings every year." The
.statistics show that on European roads the passengers killed are
12 for each billion passengers, carried one .mile. On American
â¢roads 15 are killed for each billion carried one mile. Of employes,
* European roads kill 29 to each billion tons of freight carried one
* mile. American roads kill only 18. It is evident, therefore, s the im
peachment of American roads in respect to casualties lacks truth.
The accident insurance statistics of this country show that; of all
the accidents in a year 24 per cent happen to people on foot; 18 per
cent to those indoors, in houses; 18 per cent from horses and ve
â¢ hides; 15 per cent at houses outside, and 4 per cent in railroad
travel. Whether public ownership will entirely abolish actidents
\u2666 may be asserted, but remains to be proved.
TO CONSIDER RECIPROCITY.
UNCOMMITTED to any special plan of reciprocity, but earn-;
estly seeking the good results of it by any method found wise
and practicable and proved agreeable to the lawmakers, the
committee of arrangements j for a national reciprocity conference
have issued their call to meet in Chicago August 15 and 1 6. The
committee wishes to hold attention first of all to one brief explana
tion:. "There has been a misapprehension as to the real aims of
the conference because of the assumption that this is a revival of
the old agitation for the same old reciprocity treaties and the same
old method of negotiation, which are thought to be hopeless." They
wish to correct .that misapprehension. They favor a"ny plan of pro
cedure that will bring about the desired result.
That result is the establishment of fairer trade relations with
foreign nations. They wish the prompt acknowledgment in prac
tice t)f the principle of conceding something to such' nations as will
concede' valuable trading rights to ourselves: It is evident from
the tone of the call that the intention is not to have the conference
argue the principle in a merely academic way. We have to face
in a practical way the fact that European Governments are increas
ing restrictions which shut out American export trade in 'agricul
tural products and manufactured goods. Germany has a new pro
hibitive tariff designed to keep out American breadstuff's and pro
visions. T.he power of retaliation has been put to the test and
found wan-ting. It is said. to. have been very costly to both pro
ducers and manufacturers. The committee does not ' attempt to
confine the proposed work by any definite outline, but they announce
themselves as believing in the principles as to our foreign relations
which were enunciated by McKinley in his last great speech, at
Buffalo, just' before his assassination. s
They suggest that if it shall be agreed that. the .most business
like, method of applying the protective principle is to use the* one
already set up by France and Germany of a maximum* and a mini
mum schedule, then the adoption of that should be the endeavor.
Under a fairly drawn . maximum-and-minimum tariff law the Gov
ernment could directly negotiate international agreements. The
callers of the conference wish to procure the substitution of tlie
principle of reciprocity for that of retaliation and exclusion; Whether
this be accomplished by direct reciprocity treaties,- or in some other
way, they do not care. /\"
The conference is called. by a number of the large, stock grow
ers* associations and of breeders offine cattle, by the Millers'^Na
tional Federation, by the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago,
the Illinois Manufacturers' Association and several 'others. .

WHEN MAN RENTS
A HOUSE.
; "Yes, I've rented a house." he said with
aii accent of . finality. "She gsts here
Tuesday, â¢ you see. and I couldn't put It
off any longer, and â¢' it's a dandy." >

husband,' his I eye beaming, "it's â¢ carved;
and has a heavy lid." :* > \u0084;-:
' 'An oaken settee," thought his listener.
"You .ought to see the chandelier in the
dining-room," he went on, "it has four,
lights that go 'up and. four -down, some-:
thing like flowers, you know, and in the
middle is 'a i large red shade, round and
pretty, and is either for gas or electric
light." \u25a0--_\u25a0 . -\ â¢

EXPERT ON LIARS.
.. A .KansaSjClty lawyer tells, of. the usa
of "expert testimony' on lying. .Ha says:
"I was Prosecuting Attorney for Finney
County in.lSSl, and; had. a fellow up be
fore Squire Nl C. Jones on the charge of
horse stealing. He hired Mike . Sutton
to defend him, and "when the case was
called I proved beyond question, by a wit
ness who witnessed the theft, ; that we
had the right man. After the prosecu
tion had rested, Sutton introduced 'Buf
falo' Jones as a witness.' and gravely in
formed the court "that he ; intended to
prove by him that my witness * had Hed.
'Buffalo* took the /stand" and swore that,
white he had never seen nor heard of the
witness*before," and knew nothing at all
about the crime committed, he had had
a great deal of experience with men, and
could. tell pretty certain when they were
lying. Then he proceeded to tell how
men acted when thty were lying, and
gave the expert opinion that my witness
had* sworn to lies from the word go. I
protested against such performances, but
Sutton made the Judge believe he had as
much right to introduce an expert on
liars as he would -have to introduce an
expert on* medicine - or any other science,
atid the result , was | the thief was dis
missed v from â¢ custody."--New York Tri

SAMPLES OF MILK
City Chemist Files Report.
and Dealers Are to Be
Arrested.
City Chemist Gibbs yesterday filed a
report with the Health Board to the
effect that six samples of milk he hud
examined disclosed the presence of
formalin, which Health Officer Ragan
declares. to be the most dangerous of
preservatives. Ragan ordered that
warrants be sworn out' to-day for. the
arrest of the milk dealers from whom
the samples were taken. According to
Gibbs' report they are J. Langsdorf of
911 Â»Â£ ' Larkin street; C. N. Johnson,
163Â«> Howard street; Labrucherle Bros.,
4t)o Howard street; B. A. Russmann, 112
San Jose avenue; C. Muller, 4 Adair
street, and Palmiter Bros., 3534 Seven
teenth street. The milk supplied by
Langsdorf, Russmann and Muller were
also deficient in butter fat. .
A sample of milk taken from the res
taurant of E. A. Keil at 222 Sutter
street disclosed the presence of borax.
While this is regarded as harmless
when taken in minute quantities,
Ragan is desirous of ascertaining from
what dairy Keil unknowingly pur
chased the adulterated milk. He sum
moned Keil to appear at the Health
Office to explain. , ...
Notwithstanding the presence of
borax, the milk contained as many as
1.950.000 bacteria to each cubic centi- i
meter, the limit of germs allowed being
fixed at 500.000. Ragan says the borax
evidently failed to get in its work.
Samples of milk taken from, other
places disclosed the presence of germs
above the legal limit.

SEALS BAT OUT VICTORY IN THE TENTH
Pitcher Pierce
There for a
while.
Mr Pierce, bush leaguer, looked like
a pretty good sort of pitcher for about
eight innings and a half yesterday.
Then all of a sudden he took on the ap
pearance of an awful tramp ,and while
he looked easy the Angels proceeded to
wallop and run. Their work was well
done and it took just about five min
utes to transform a good ball game
into a comedy.
For a full seven and a half innings
Pierce had the Angels swinging their
heads off and bitting up nothing but
pop files. All the fans agreed that the
busher was the real McCoy and good
enough to twist 'em over for Muggsy
McGraw's bunch. When the Angels
made a run in the eighth the wise ones
were not disturbed, as it was not
Pierces xault. . â¢f^yiS
But the youngster lost all his pres
tige in the ninth when he went. wrong,
after his fielders^ began to throw him
down as fast as 'the ball was clouted
over the grass. Dillon started it with
a pass and Bras hear beat out a bunt.
Ross faded away, on strikes, but Cra
vath, Spies, Tozier, Bernard and Flood
began to wallop the ball. Those that
did not drop safely were booted around
by the Commuters, and the five runs
which followed were easy. Pierce let
in a. couple himself by throwing the
ball away at third base when he had
an easy chance.
Throughout the game Toiler's . spit
ball kept bending and twisting so de
ceptively that the Commuters looked
like a lot of suckers. Van Haltren hit
safely in the third and Devereaux man
aged to bingle one in the eighth, but
the rest of the time the Commuters
spent in slamming the leather right
into the mitts of an infielder or an out
fielder.
Cal. McVey still stuck as an umpire
and the talent gave him a good time.
He made a few decisions that did not
appeal to the players and they were al
ways there in a bunch to start an ar
gumenu This process tended to delay
the game many minutes and cause the
sun gods on the bleechers to pass out
opinions on" umpires and ungentle
manly ball tossers. The score:

PROFESSIONAL GOLFERS
BEGIN THEIR TOURNEY
Wonderful Work of Martin O'Loughlin,
a Seventeen- Year-Old Boy, Sur
prises the Crowd.
NEW YORK, July 13.â For the first
time in the history of golf In the United
States a professional tournament was
begun to-day on the public links. Fifty
two of the most prominent 'professional
golfers east of the Alleghanies started
in this tournament over the Van Cort
landt Park links and fifty of these
turned in cards for a double journey of
the entire course. When play began In
the morning there was a fairly large
q,rowd of spectators on the course, but
a heavy rainstorm soon dispersed the
onlookers. The links were deluged and
made so soggy that low scores were not
looked for. .
The feature of the morning round
was the excellent work done by. Martin
O'Loughlin, a 17-year-old . boy, who
learned the game as a caddy at Plain
field. N. J. He negotiated the course In
seventy-eight strokes and. during his
tour a heavy, rain storm was in evi
dence. The boy slackened his â¢ pace,
however, in the afternoon. The tourna
ment will be completed to-morrow, f

.. SRATTLE. July 13.â Not a'favorite won
at ; The Meadows this afternoon. The at

poor. The feature of the day was Coo

longs. In this race, Corn Blossom, the
favorite, was practically left at the post.
Conreid had a : clear start with enough
left to stall off the rush of Follow Me,
who looked . like a winner In another
stride. In the mile race Starter Duks
made another bungle, leaving Jardln de
Paris, an even money, favorite, at the
post. With this condition she caught up
with her field at the half, but was bunch
ed in the stretch and had to pull up. The

HEAVY STORMS
Three Beep Sea Ships, Two
From Old World and One
From Australia. Enter Port
ZEALANDIA ARRIVES
iSteamship Leaves Big Ship
ment of Gold at Seattle,
but Brings Valuable Furs
The British ship Loudon Hill, the
French bark Touralne and the German
ship Oregon arrived yesterday from as
many foreign ports and each brought
a tale of heavy weather encountered
en the high seas. They all sustained
more or less of damage.
The Loudon Hill, which was laid up
pi Martinez for two years before 6he
left here for Australia, from where 6he
has Just returned, encountered a hur
ricane while trying to beat off the New
Zealand coast. This was on April 14
in Cooks' Straits. The hurricane con
tinued five days. The ship was re
peatedly tnrown on her beam ends, and
most of the time the decks were filled
with water to the rails. The salt water
found Its way into cabin and forecastle
and life on board was made miserable
for all bands. A whole suit of Balls
was blown into ribbons.
It was the first sea shipped that did
ir.ost damage to the crew. All -hands
were on deck, standing by to take in
6ail. With a roar like thunder the
water poured over the rail and every
man on the main deck was swept along
until they were dashed against some
thing solid. Boatswain Daley was car
ried over the rail, but managed to
hang on to a brace and drag himself
back when the waters had receded.
Seven men were more or less seriously
hyrt by that big sea. Some of them
were able to work the next day.
others were in their bunks for two
weeks and several still feel the effects
of the awful bruising they sustained
during that wild roll on deck with the
runaway wave. Captain Boyd of the
Loudon Hill is accompanied by his wife
and there is not a sailor on board who
Freaks of the heavy weather more as
a matter of course than does Mrs.
Boyd. After the hurricane the Loudon
Hill encountered head winds nearly all
the way across the Pacific
The French bark Touraine, 168 days
from Cardiff, lost several spars in
heavy weather and on one occasion
during the voyage, had her steering
g-ear knocked out of commission.
The German ship Oregon left Ant
werp for this port November 12, 1904.
Head winds and gales were responsible
for slow progress and April 22 she was
obliged to put into Valparaiso for pro
visions and water. She resumed her
voyage April 24 and the rest, of the trip
was uneventful.
Steomship Zealandla Arrives.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's liner fcea
landia. at present under charter to the Bame

City Branch Takes Stand
Against Standard Oil
POSES AS INDEPENDENT
Witness Tells How Rocke
feller Concern Profits
by Its Own Unpopularity
KANSAS CITY- July 13.â The giving of
rebates as a common practice to secure
business ,v.as brought out .to-day in. the
testimony "of ' A. G. Shires* of Marietta.
Ohio,': traveling salesman for the Pennsyl
vania' Refining Company of Oil City, who
was a witness' lat the hearing, in the
State's suit; to oust the Standard Oil
Company, the Republic Oil Company and
the Company from the
State" of ; Missouri. \ Shires was manager
for the .Republic Oil Company In 1903 and
came" to ' Kansas, City in June. He found
the. Standard and the National the "only"
companies here, he said. He had charge
of .-; the 'tank business " for " the Republic,
the .lubricating oil department and
handled ; gasoline and kerosene for
grocers. He was, he said. Instructed to
get after the National's customers. Henry
Teagle,*" " the manager, Shires said, told
him to get certain of the National's
customers and if necessary pay a rebate
of one-half " cent . a : gallon." These rebates
wete paid in cash to customers. He said
he never ' had tried to : get trade in the
Standard's customers.- The rebate ap
plied only to the National's trade. Shires
said he was told by Teagle to say to
customers that the Republic Oil Company
was an independent concern.
"Did you over, during your whole em
ployment here," inquired Attorney Gen
eral Hadley, "offer any. rebate or\ any
inducement to customers to take their
trade from the Standard Oil Company?"
, "No K sir; never."
. "Where did you get the information
regarding prices to charge for oil?"
"F>onV the Standard Oil Company, al
ways." .
"How did you instruct your salesmen
here?" -\u25a0' / '
"To say that the Republic Oil Company
was an independent company; that it had
no connection with the Standard Oil
Company."
Shires said that when he was manager
it St. Joseph for the Republic Company
he once, had too much oil on hand and
he wired Kansas City for instructions.
He was ordered, he said, to transfer the
oil to the Standard. Oil Company and did
so. He sometimes used the Standard's
horses. There was no competition in St.
Joseph or Kansas City between the Re
public and the Standard.

VALLEJO. July 13. â An order was
received from the Navy Department at
the yard to-day reinstating Foreman
Luke Burke of the steam engineering
department. The Board of Labor found
Burke sruilty on several charges
brought by George P. Dunphy, a yard
employe under Burke, and recommend

Dunphy charged that Burke was
taking material from the yard. The
trial followed and Burke was found
guilty. Dunphy is now on the carpet,
with several charges against him. His
action has so aroused the feelings of
the workmen that it has been neces

3tevr York Stock Market.
NETV YORK, July IS. â Tbe vigorous recov
ery of yesterday from the effects of tbe sharp
VpeculaUve liquidation of the day before
â¢roused brilliant hopes la. the mind o! the pro
iaesional element that the stock market was to
feel the benefit of the Improved technical posi
tion resulting from the taking of profits and
would be prepared to renew the advance with
out serious obstacles. The result, however.
disappointed these hopes and offered an admo
tiltlon that some restraining force exists upon
toy immediate renewal of speculative opera
tions. What the restraining force may be
Â£oes cot anpear on thÂ« face of developments,
but tt Is conjectured In the neighborhood of
the Stock Exchange Itself that the banking
authorities would be willing to see a restric
tion on the amount of funds borrowed for the
purpose of speculative commitments In stocks
tmtll other autumn requirements on the money
market are better defined. The market start -
off with something like a rush to-day In
Yrontlsttatloa of the buoyant movement at the
" close yesterday. The strength thus shown was
\u25a0 promptly taken advantage of to realize profits
by professional traders who secured holdings
on the decline of Tuesday. This Impatience to
turn over profits was In itself discouraging to
those hoping for an extensive recovery. Most
careful Inquiry seems to throw doubts on the
authority for some of the rumors circulated
late yesterday as to an Intended large distribu
tion of surplus assets to Northern Pacific and
Great Northern stockholders, although It was
fought to revlvÂ« the whole series of rumors of
plans for a readjustment of Northern Securi
ties holdings. The most effective , response to
<say was in St. Paul and Atchlson. The re
sponse of Baltimore and Ohio to the Increase
in its dividend rate was also & disappointment
to the followers cf the market. It is, to be
sure, according to numerous precedents for a
stock to react on thÂ« publication of the news
vhich was motive for its advance, but the Im
mediate precedent of the uninterrupted advance
of Reading after its dividend Increase had
eroused hopes of a new order of things. The
effect of the dividend action on Baltimore and
Ohio was seen, however. In Pennsylvania and
Norfolk end Western, which enjoyed a season
of strength. The July iron statistics failed to
chow auy of the revival of which there has
lwÂ»en talk in stock market circles. In connec
tion with the recent strength of the steel In
dustry," but the contemplation of~ prodigious
figures of the half-year's production and con
sumption may be a presumptive lesson of the
vast expansion in this industry and of the far
reaching influences of this fact on the Industry
of the country as a whole. Weather reports
from the crop regions supplemented the good
effect shown yesterday from the Government
crop report. Tbe sustaining Influences proved
unavailing to hold the market against the
pressure on It and last prices were near the
.lowest of the day. A large proportion of the
* total business of the day was done during the
first hour.
The Japanese bonds were strong on account
of the success cf the subscription of the new
Issue of 4Ug,
The bond market as a whole was Irregular.
Total sales, par value. $2,282,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

"Yew York Cotton Market.
NEW , YORK, July 13.â The renewed slump
it; the cottcn market to-day was directly due
to a resumption ' of liquidation _on a larger
seals than even was :, the : case yesterday, : to
gether with a withdrawal or buyers from .- the'
market. These conditions were unquestionably
Influenced by the development of further "sur
prising weakness at Liverpool : and the; posting
of another weather map showing clear all over
TexÂ»s for the third successive day. . Too.niany 1
bulls are in the market, and sellers are finding
a very congested condition" when they endeavor
to unload, with support ot outsiders withdrawn
and better weather and weaker Liverpool mar
kets. Traders are looking . for a much more
favorable weekly . Government > report next
Tuesday, as the weather conditions throughout
Texas and the Mississippi .Valley I have ! been
ideal for the past four- days- and farmers are
now actively pursuing their work of cultivation
in all directions. . - â¢ -. . ' ; -
( While trading, was not :arge, there seemed
to be general liquidation among the .longs,
and there was a .great ceai of short.' selling.
It was supposed that f ormer bull leaders were
working for somewhat lower prices, g though
th<y were: sending out bullish gossip, on the
croji.' There stums to be less demand for. spot
cottcn, as it Is now approaching; the time for
the movement of the new. crop. "'.The general
bellftf.lsj tb.'.t the Government has rnade'tlie
decrease irr acreage too low, but on the whole
there has been, no doubt, a certain percentage
throughout caused by wet weather.

The Giant Powder Company's works
on Point Pinole, near Sobrante, were
ilie scene of an explosion at 7:30 o'clock
this morning:, in which eight- men were
killed and one man seriously injured.
A number of buildings, together \u25a0with
a large quantity of dynamite, were de
stroyed.
Those killed were William H. Dwyer,
foreman of the dynamite mixing-house,
where the explosion occurred, and his
entire crew of seven Chinese. The In
jured man was a Chinese, who was
working in a small weighing-house
fifty feet from the mixing-house.
Dwyer, who was Â£tn expert powder
handler, -was horribly mangled, but
enough of his body was found in the
debris for identification. Only three of
the seven Chinese bQdies ' were re
covered. The injured man was treated
at the works and then sent to San
Francisco.
The cause of the explosion is unex
plainable. It was not more than half
an hour after the crew for
work that the catastrophe -.occurred.
So terrific -was the shock that 'heavy
pieces of machinery werevblown hun
dreds of feet into the bay, that laps the
bluff upon which the mixing-house
stood. A horse hitched to a tramcar,
that contained 1000 pounds of manu
factured dynamite, was hurled over the
abrupt declivity into the water, a
shapeless mass. The concussion and
flames from the mixing-house exploded
the carload of dynamite, and \u25a0 this, it
is believed by the officials at the works,
was the cause of most of- the damage.
The fire spread over the dry hillsides,
sweeping toward other isolated struc
tures, but the company's fire brigade
checked the course of the flames before
serious damage was done.
SHdOK VERY HEAVY.
The shock from the explosion was
felt for miles around, although the ac
tual damage, counted in money, was
not of serious consequence. 'At the
works nearby structures were partly
destroyed, much window glass being
smashed. "
Two craters, , burned and charred
timbers, twisted and broken machinery,
(splinters and fragments of the roof and
structures In a mass of undistinguisha
ble debris marked the site of the mix
ing-house, over the ruins of 'which all
day men played streams of water. The
only tangible relic was the engine
frame and the fly \u25a0wheel that operated
the mixing wheels In the mill. As is
customary at powder works the dyna
mite mill was isolated from the other
buildings. It was sheltered on two
sides by the bluff into which it had
been built. On the west and north the
bay runs along the jutting point.
Work began . this morning in the
dynamite house at 7 . o'clock as usual.
Nothing occurred to attract attention
until nearly half an hour later, when
the deep boom of the explosion and the
flare of flames, smoke laden, summoned
the startled officials to the scene. It

"What shall we' do to be saved?" was
the title of one of Robt. Ingersoll's lec-
tures. People of faith and people of no
faith nocked to. bear It. Thousands are
asking, "What shall I do to gret . rid . of
dandruff?" The answer Is, "Kill . the
gei'm that causes dandruff, Tallin? hair
and finally baldness; and. the only thing-
that will do; it is'Newbro's Herplclde.7
That is the very latest discovery of the
laboratory, and It â¢Is the only prepara-
tion that claims to. or that will, kill the"
pestiferous dandruff germ. It is also a
delightful hair-dressing, free .from-/ oil
or grease or sticky â¢ substances. Try ; it
and be convinced, of its Â» actual merit'

was quick work with ] the fire hose
and a crowd of workmen, well directed,
started on' the grewsome .labor of res
cue, if rescue there . could be in that
tangled mass of ruins.
Only one live man out. of the crew
was . found. 0 He, Wong Hea, was pulled
out from the wreckage, a deep, cut; in
his back, his .eft arm badly fractured,
together with numerous;: cuts and
bruises on head and body. Wong was
taken to the laboratory, where surgi
cal attention was given him..
While the wrecking ; crew dug and
delved through the ruins and fought
the tire across "the fields, the* search
for bodies was commenced.
IDENTIFICATION DIFFICULT. ./
The trunk and head of Dwyer's body,
charred and .blackened, . were re'eovered.
His arms and Jegs were blown oft.
Money and . a watch in the 'half de
stroyed garments ', served as '; means of
identification. -A'.Chinaman's blackened
corpse was found on ; the bay. shore be
neath the bluff. Other parts; of bodies
were recovered .by the most 3 diligent
raking of the wreckage and the fields
around the destroyed mill.
As soon as the officials. '^were ap
prised of the accident, Dr.' C.L.^ Abbott
of Richmond and ' Dr. X A. Martin 'of
San Pablo ;.were : hurried to the works.
They gave' their attention vto .the in
jured Chinaman, .who was later taken
in charge by some of his countrymen.
Nearly all of the Chinamen 1 at the
works made their customary .exodus
from the grounds as soon as:they knew
of the fatalities." 'The .practice l to \ de
part is a common one, with: the "Chinese,

had Just escaped the fate that, had
overtaken Robert Bendlnelli. an Italian
fruit peddler, who had- been drowned

foot \u25a0<\u25a0 of Webster street about 4 o'clock
in the ; afternoon ' to - wash \u25a0 his t wagon.
Walter, aged 7. and Ralph. 6, climbed
into the peddler's wagon. Walter's
10-year-old brother, Harold, .refused
to * go" with him and his little friend,
but watched from, the - shore. All at
once the wagon keeled over, hav
ing seemingly struck a bank of. shifting
ground . beneath' -the water. Horse,
wagon and its load of human lives
disappeared. Harold Francis saw the
accident and rushed up , the street." tell
ing " every one he met of It. . Lenette
heard " the cries and rushed from 'his
work . in the ~ soap . factory and dragged
the boys "from the water -at the risk, of
his own life.
.'\u25a0'. Patrol 'Wagon Driver i Fitzpatrick of
the North End station got the. call from
the beach. He drove madly to the scene
of the accident, and with -his horses on
a 'dead run . : started for the ' Central
Emergency Hospital. : The boys had al
most stopped breathing. A moment
meant everything.* Fltzpatrick. with a
master : hand.' guided his team through
the < thickly crowded streets at almost
racehorse -speed, and reached the hospi
tal just eighteen minutes from the time
he received the ;call at" the :North End
station,' 'and this was (done with Police
Departments horses. To Driver Fitz

CHATHAM LOSES FIGHT
Claim Is 3lade by Opposing
Candidates That Ballots
Were Improperly Guarded
The District Court of Appeal decided
that J. H. Mansfield was properly elected
Sheriff of San Mateo County. in Novem
ber, ISO 2. R. S. Chatham, also a candi
date, claimed that he had been legally
chosen for the ofnee and instituted a y* v V
to establish his contentions. The Boar3|
of Supervisors canvassed the returns and
declared that Mansfield bad received llil
votes and Chatham 1375. ;;.'.' * *
"The case was tried before Judge Frank
Murasky of this city, acting as Superior
Judge of San Mateo County. He> decided
that Chatham' had received 1213 votes and
Mansfield only 1213. The latter appealed
and has secured the reversal which gives
him the office. The claim was made that
the ballots had been tampered 'with. In
respect to that assertion the court says:
. On the recount there waa one less ballot la
Baden Precinct thaa the official canvass
showed; In Oolma Precinct the ofScla! canvass
showed four more ballots than were produced
In court, and In Menlo Park Precinct there
waa one more ballot produced In court than
the official canvass showed. In the count ta
court defendant suffered a net loss of thirty
six votes from that shown by the official count
in these three precincts. The difference of six
ballots between the official count and the bal
lots counted In court during: the trial to cer
tainly a strong 1 circumstance tending to Ufi>
peach the Integrity of the ballots. .
The ballots from the outside precincts
were broken open. They had been sent
by express to the County ,i Clerk and
there deposited on the floor of ' a vault,
where they were within easy reach of
friends of â¢ both contestants. .
