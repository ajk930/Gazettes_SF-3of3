When the news concerning, the

BOULDER CREEK. Sept. 8.âUn
abated and unchecked, the fire that
has been threatening the ... California
State Park finally to-day swept
through the stately park and laid low
the hitherto untouched woodland, mak
ing a dreary waste of the State's pleas
ure ground. The fire started near the
headwaters of Waterman Creeek, near
where the California' Timber Company
was conducting milling operations, and
traveled easterly along the Waterman
and Pescadero creeks over the lands
of. McAbee i Bros., whose mill and
possessions were eagerly licked up. The
lives of two men were sacrificed, in an
endeavor to save the mill.
John L. Koster's home was entirely
destroyed." - The schoolhouse at Sequoia
was saved by -the bravery and heroism
of Thomas and James Maddock, who,
when deserted by their comrades,
stayed by. the burning building, arid by
pulling off part of the boards and
shingles saved it.
The fire. is now raging fiercely and is
utterly .-beyond control at 6:20 ,p. m.
The flre reached the extreme north
easterly limit of the park, where every

During the strike approximately
E3.000 persons have been involved, and
the 6truggle Is estimated to have cost
the men about $5,000,000 in wages, as
against an estimated loss of $7, 500,000
to the packers In business and In in
creased expenses. The greatest num
ber of men idle in Chicago during the
strike was 26.600, and the total In the
country outside of this city is estimated
to have been about the same number.
The original cause of the strike was
the demand by the Butchers' Union
that the packers pay to the unskilled
workmen 1SV4 cents an hour. The
packers refused to sign an agreement,
but offered to arbitrate. This was ac
cepted, the strikers agreeing to return
to work, pending the decision of the
arbitrators. The men, however, were
dissatisfied with the manner in which
they were being put to work and de
clared that they would not return un
less all the men were given their old
places In one day's time. The packers
declared that this was impossible and
the men went on strike for the secon-1
time. They now return to work under
the conditions that existed before the
Etrike.
CHICAGO. Sept. 8.â The strike of the
butcher Â¦workmen, which has demoral
ised the meat-packing Industry
throughout the entire country, was of
ficially declared off to-night by Pres
ident Michael J. Donnelly of the Amal
gamated Meat Cutters and Butcher
Workmen's Union of America. This
morning Donnelly telegraphed to the
members cf the national executive
committee, asking their consent to an
announcement of the end of the strug
gle, and to-night, having received fa
vorable ansv.ers from all, he declared
that the etrike of the msmbsrs of his
organization would end at midnight.'
The strike of the members of .'the
affiliated unions at the stock yards,
who quit~\vork~In~fr}-rnpathy "\vith~the"
butchers, -will be. officially "called j off
to-morrow morning at a ' meeting Â« of
the conference board of the AllieQ
Trades. This was decided upon at a
meeting of the central body of the Al
lied Trafies held to-night.
When the packers were notified to
night that it had been decided to. end
the strike, they announced that they
would give places, as far as possible.
to the skilled men. but it was stated at
thÂ» same time that many of these men
would be unable to secure their old
places, as, in many, cases, the work
was being performed satisfactorily by
ttifn who had been engaged since the
commencement of the strike. It is ex
pected that the majority | of the un
skilled men will be unable to regain
their old positions. It was the ques
tion of a wage scale for this class of
men that brought about the strike, the
packers refusing to sign an agreement
with any class other than skilled work
men.
DERBY, Conn., Sept. 8. â Expecting
every minute to see her dashed to
death, 5000, persons at Orange Fair
saw Miss Mabel Kent, a pretty nine
teen-year-old girl of Shelton, borne out
of sight, clutching the bar of a huse
parachute below a balloon, her body
swaying at full length in the air.
Her hands were tightly lashed to the
bar and the rope held her until she
had reached an altitude of nearly three
miles from the point of ascension. The
balloon descended to the top of a tree
fifty feet high, where she managed to
free herself. She was rescued in a
semi-conscious condition.
' A balloon ascension and parachute
leap by Professor Hayden had been an
nounced as one of- the attractions of the
afternoon. An invitation for any young
woman to accompany â¢ him was ac
cepted by Miss Kent.
Professor Hayden lashed her loosely
by , her feet to the trapeze bar and
tied her wrists to a guy rope. As the
balloon ascended the fetters slipped
from the woman's feet, leaving her a
waving human pendulum. The straps
that held her wrists to the guy rope
forjned the only tie that kept her from
falling. Fortunately these held fast.
The crowd in the fair grounds shrieked
in- agony.
Miss Kent says that she was too
frightened to cry. She had expected to
be able to stand on the trapeze, but
the slipping of her feet bandages left
her helpless.
- Down the balloon shot and hundreds
of spectators who had seen the inci
dent rushed to the spot where it was
falling. It struck in the top of a tree
and Miss Kent lodged in its branches,
where she was rescued.

for a few minutes. The dinner did not
start until 11 o'clock. The Denver
drill corps was asked to act as repre

In the beautiful banquet-room of the

the evening was Sir Knight Samuel C.

One of the incidents of the evening
was the arrival of the Louisville Com

Next came the election of a grand

Next Meeting to
i 'Be Held' at
Boston Commandery No. 2, over
Â¦whose refusal to march in last Tues
day's great parade there has been
much comment, will have a parade of
Its own this afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
The commandery, which Is the oldest
In Massachusetts, was to have had the
right of line under the Massachusetts
Grand Commandery In the parade, but
at the last moment orders came plac-
Icr De Molay Commandery of Boston
in the lead. This was resented by the
Boston commandery. which marched
back to its headquarters at the St.
Francis Hotel and disbanded.
The route of to-day's parade will be
from the St. Francis over Powell
street to Market and down Market to
the ferry and return. They will be pre
ceded by the commandery band.
\ jpitir.fr jiurnalists 'had an op
portunity in the evening to see
the Press Club of San Francisco,
to partake of its usual generous
hospitality and to hear its ex
cellent musicians render a select pro
gramme. It was an "open house" for
the Knights and newspaper men from
the Eastern and coast cities. The
beautiful decorations were much ad
mired by the guests.

Promenade concerts In the nave of
the Ferry building attracted large
crowds day and evening. The Earl
ef Euston was among those who
listened to the music in the even
ing and enjoyed it. He was received
under a canopy of American and
English flags. The combination of
colors and the sentiment they inspired
pleased him immensely.
The Chinese play at the Grand
Optra-house pieced many whb live
East of the Rockies and who do not
have their washing done at a Chinese
laundry. The novelty of the thing was
what drew the well-filled house and
afforded amusement for those to whoni
the undramatic Eide of Chinese life 1 is
unknown.
Several striking and highly interest
ing entertainments were the features
of the evening's pleasures. The flower
of socity bloomed in "all its radiance of
rocial color at the v Mark Hopkins In
stitute. No more "â¢brilliant reception
was on the rec<>rd for the week of
brilliant affairs. Xo nook' or corner
of the artistic ballroom, reception
rooms and banquet hall but held a
bud who was not born' to blush unseen
and waste her sweetness on the desert
air. Bohemia did homage to Miss
Flora McFlimsy and Ignored in the
general pleasantness the staid rules
that teach of things Jess genial
than Knight Templarism. In . short,
there was "one of the best times
of the week, so deliciously informal,
notwithstanding full dress and all
that," as a belle from the blue grass
country put jt.
Golden Gate Commandery was host
yesterday afternoon end evening at the
most formal and one of the most en
joyable of the. many functions ar
ranged to entertain the visiting Sir
Knights and their families. The most
picturesque event of the day's pro
gramme was the concert In the Greek
Theater at the University of Cali
fornia. Excursions to the stately peak
of Tamalpais, to the Cliff House, park,
Eutro Heights, and ocean beach and
trips around the bay served to furnish
relaxation and pleasure for great mul
titudes. The several commandery head
quarters, presented animated scenes,
notwithstanding the great heat. Many
commanderies held open house, notably
Fresno, which not only dispensed hos
pitality at Pythian Castle, but present
ed each caller with- a handsome sou
venir and a carton of raisins or other
treated fruit.
New officers of the Grand Encamp
ment of Knight* Templar have been
elected, this high body has adjourned
and naught but entertainment for the
reet of the week is before the', thou
sands of remaining visitors. Intense
interest was manifested in the -result
of the .conferences of. the Grand En
campment, -although it was pretty well;
known eome days ago who would be
likely to win honor and rank as re
sults of the election.

FOR TO-DAY
Vacaville Commandery No. 38 has
made its headquarters in the Me

fruits, which are dispensed to all
visiting Sir Knights and their friends.
The vicinity of Vacaville is famous for
delicious fruit.
Fifty crates are received each day
from Vacaville for free distribution
and 5000 cartons packed . with fruit
are given away each day to the visit
ors. The demand is so great that the
commandery has a reserve in cold
storage to' 1 give each visiting com
mandery r supply to take home. Â«V -/

preciation of Vacaville's generosity.

; The members of the club turned out
in force to give the visitors a hearty
welcome, and early in the evening they
commenced to arrive. The affair was
entirely informal and full dress was
barred under penalty. There were no
ladies present to add grace to the
evening's entertainment.
After the party had gathered in the
Jinks room of the club and the pro
gramme of the evening was under way,
a Bohemian lunch was served, together
with refreshing liquids out 'of -'cool,
deep** steins, that proved : exceptionally
good during the warm evening.'
One of the most interesting events of
the evening was the fun- furnished by
Rice and Cady when they gave one of
their typical Dutch sketches that have
captured the town at Fischer's. - â¢
The club provided an orchestra of six
pieces and several fine selections were
r^dered by the Press Club Quartet.
Bobby North, also of Fischer's, was in
evidence with a few selections of "coon
opera" that amused the crowd. - . .
. One speaker who addressed the gath
ering was listened to with interest. He
was C. H. Wilson, . chairman of the
press committee of the Knights Tem
plar. In a short speech that was re
ceived with much applause, he thanked
the members of the press for the work
they had done in connection with the
conclave and promised, that the
Knights would appreciate and remem
ber it:
. The announcements and introduc
tions were made by the president â¢ of
the club. W. . C. Holloway. and it .was
owing to him and the efficient work of
the officers of the club. that the . pro
gramme passed off withput a hitch.
Captain ' W. ' G. Leale told many in
teresting stories, ! and Paul Barnes,
from the Orpheum, gave some enter
taining monologue selections. There
were violin solos by Franz Adelrnann
and * piano ' solos, by Uda ( Waldrop," a
brother of Miss Oza.Waldrop,- formerly
the ingenue, at "the Alcazar Theater,
now ' with^' the Belasco stock at Los
Angeles.
Vocal solos 'were rendered by Andre
Y. Wood, Melville Stokes of the Tlv
oli,' and "Jenkins of ; the ; Lorlng Club,
while 7 Jules 'â' Mersf elder got off an in
teresting Chinese "collection.
Altogether,.', the : evenjrig , passed into
morning with! ease and rapidity, and

The Press Club "of 'San Francisco
gave an entertainment and Jinks last
night to 'the- members of the press
among the Knights Templar who made
the pilgrimage to San Francisco. The
programme provided was a long and
elaborate one and the comfortable
quarters of the club were brilliantly
lighted.
Though the sun beat down merciless
ly upon the pavements outside. It was
comparatively cool among the fir
branches within. the Pavilion. -.Â»>. Â¦.'"
In the evening several couples gath
ered energy enough to dance and quits
a number followed their example. The
Juvenile band of the Masonic Home at
Decoto, composed of some of . the
youngest musicians in the world, en
tertained. the guests with music.

The r great.. pave of the;ferry building
was thronged last night ; with hun

aisle and stopped betimes to partakl of
the refreshments served with prodigal
hand. At each! end- of the great hall
way bands alternately played sweet
music. The musicians were hidden be

branches. Numerically, last nigiri was
the most successful of the promenade
concerts in the ferry building. Unfor
tunately,," however^ owing to an; acci
dent, Itj-waa impossible to turn on. the
current which floods the building with
light from thousands of vari-cojbred
incandescent globes, and the ordinary
arc lights were used. The misfortune
was taken good-naturedly. by. alland a
merry evening was spent.
The committee in charge last night
consisted of J. C. Campbell, past com

left. '"Well, I goes and explains to

Interested."
A. Chinaman in sky blue trousers
and a crazy quilt, with a pagoda on

The Governor and party arrived
shortly after 9 o'clock and the great
crowd gave way for them to gain ad

to pay greetings to the hosts of the
evening. They were, closely followed
by the Earl of Euston and suite. The
Earl was the cynosure of all eyes. He
made the rounds of the long reception

Sometimes several hundred were
compelled to wait before they could
gain admission. They camped upon
the stone fences surrounding the in
stitute* and sat upon the lawn and
many took advantage of the windows
of the Fairmoiint Hotel across the
street to view the proceedings. The
commandery had prepared for this
very, emergency and to meet its de
mands had the splendid Third Artil
lery Corps band," U. S. A., stationed
upon the lawn. Under the leadership
of Chief Musician Armand Putz a de
lightful programme of high class
music was rendered, which was vo
ciferously applauded by those In the
vicinity. ' â¢ :
The great throng of, visitors began
arriving soon after 7:30 p. m. and
from then on until midnight a steady
stream passed Into the building

was so great that temporarily the po

and keep many waiting on the out
side until room could be made within.

Every arrangement was complete to
the most minute detail, and the enjoy

indeed to be proud of its efforts, as the

The crowning feature of the enter

BERKELEY. Sept. S.â Several thou

friends attended the concert which was
given ljy the University of California
s-udents this afternoon at the Greek
Theater.
Prudent Wheeler delivered a brief
address of welcome. FleprJ' to this was
made by State Senator Ross of Canton,
Mass., who is senior warden of Boston
Commandery, the oldest Knight
Templar commandery in the United
Jitalcs. Senator Ross read his address,
-vhich vras devoted to praise of the
hospitality of California and Califor

The yelling of the rooters under Yell
Leader Lewis Bulkeley â¢\vii3 perhaps a
feature of the entertainment that
seemed to appeal to the visitors most.
The â¢"rooters" occupied one of the mid
dle sections cf the theater and the
v.- orr.cn students another next to them.
Following: the addresses and yells
came ihe concert of classical music
contributed by the university orchestra,

The concert extended over an hour,
so that the visitors had ample time to
return to San Francisco fcr dinner and
to attend the other functions in their
henor.
The excursion steamers were gayly
decorated with American flags and ban
ners of the Masonic order. Most of
them headed toward the south arm of
the bar on leaving their docks, passed
by the Union Iron Works to Hunters
Point and returned by way of Goat
Island, ; the naval training station,
Angel Island, Sausalito, Fort Point and,
of course, Powell-street wharf. The bay
was smooth as a ballroom floor; little
wind was stirring in the morning. To
ward the afternoon there was a soft,
cool breeze in the channel and no more
perfect weather for a trip could be de
sired. The Tamalpais carried about 800
persons, a band, many good things to
eat and drinks of all kinds, from lemon
ade' to champagne.
From 12 o'clock noon to 3 o'clock the
waiting-rooms of the Key route ferries
were packed with Knights and 'ladies
bound for Berkeley to listen to the
open-air concert in the Greek Theater
of the University of California. 1 Special
trains of electric cars awaited the ar
riyarof the boats* at the "yellow pier"
arid they were certainly required to ac
commodate 'the great crowd of travel
ers. The Southern Pacific ferries' car-'
STEAMERS DECORATED.
Vallejo and Mare Island were again
on the card for special excursions. The
Union Iron Works was down on the
list of the Tamalpais' places of interest.
Fort Point and Alcatraz were not for
gotten. Belvedere was patronized
ashore and the cove looked like a race
day of the Corinthians. But the
Olympic Club boats and Corinthian
yachts were Io3t in the fleets of visiting
craft. The arks huddled together near
the short line and offered shelter for
the tired traveler! who was willing to
share their hospitality. All were wel
come and many took advantage of the
invitation, "Come aboard; we'll give
you a cool drink and a warm time."
Every craft that could get up steam
or boast of a gasoline engine was -.in
demand yesterday morning, when the
warm rays of the .forenoon sun drove
sweltering humanity to the water front.
The excursion of the steamer Tamal
pais from Clay-street dock, the trips
of launches to the cruiser New York
and the voyages of the Mosquito fleet
to the bar were attended by Templars
from East and West, and by city folk
a3 well. .Ten cents for a half hour on
the water, via the ferries route, or
half a dollar for a genuine three hours
of happiness in a launch, was pro
nounced the proper thing fora warm
day and the advocates of heat reform
were in evidence in thousands when the
ticket offices opened.
1 One of the features of to-day's pro
gramme is the proposed trip to the Astl
Vineyard, Sonoma County. Grape
growing is at its height and visitors
will be enabled to learn â¢ something
about how California wines are made.
Permits to visit the vineyard may be
had from A. Sbarboro, at the Italian-
American Bank, corner of Montgomery
and Sacramento streets.
Those interested in making a trip
to the fortifications on the north sldo
of the bay may receive information re
garding the excursion from the Citi
zens' Committee, at 25 New Montgom
ery street. A boat will leave Sausall to
for Fort Baker and Point Bonita.
Tickets were sent to all Sir Knights
desiring to put in a few hours at the
Cliff House and Sutro Baths. In the
morning and afternoon there were band
concerts at the baths and in the after
noon a number of expert swimmers
from the Olympic Club gave exhibitions
of aauatic sports. All of the galleries
of the Cliff House and the main rooms
were crowded with visitors from early
morning until late at night. A contin
uous stream of vehicles passed and re
passed the famous resort. The main
drives of Golden Gate Park were alive
with teams and single "rigs" of all
descriptions.
About 600 persons attended the excur
sion to Santa Cruz and the 1 big trees.
The -special trains- N at Alameda mole
connected with the N boat leaving the
foot of Market street at 7:45 o'clock in
the morning. The excursion returned
at 8 o'clock in the evening. Four hours

CHEFU, Friday, Sept. Â».â The Port
Arthur Nova Krai of August 30 gives
some details of the recent fighting in
front of the beleaguered fortress. At 6
o'clock on the morning of August VI.
during a severe attack., Colonel Kbik
qff, commanding: the -Fourteenth regi
ment, ordered a detachment to, remove
the dead and care for the .wounded
near an unnamed. fort on the east flank.
When within rifle distance of the Japa
nese the Russians hoisted a Red Cross
flag. The Japanese gave Inviting signs
with their caps, whereupop the Rus
sians, thinking that all was well, con
tinued forward. However, . when the
detachment had reached the dead the
Japanese opened flre upon it, fatally
wounding a petty officer. The Russian
detachment, thereupon retired.
Captain Spanoff. who commanded the
detachment, believing that the Japa
nese had mistakenly fired and seeing
the further beckoning signs by the
Japanese, ordered the detachment out
a second time. The Red Cross flag was
again hoisted, but the Japanese again
fired and wounded one private. The de
tachment again retired and the attempt
to remove the dead was abandoned. â¢
On August 27 there v was a little fight
ing on the west flank. The Japanese
had two companies Intrenched at

opened a Eevere fire upon them and dis
mounted two of their guns, but the
Japanese held their position.

GARRISON REPELS ATTACK.
Â¦ On the nights of August 26 and 27 a
similar disaster befell the Japanese
near Redoubt No. 2, but no details have
been ascertained.
The foregoing information is con
tained in a small sheet issued on Sep
tember 3 by the Port Arthur Nova
Krai, a breakage in the press having
made it impossible to issue a full edi
tion. A Chinese .rriving here at mid
night confirms the story ,to the extent
of saying that he heard a report that
many Japanese had been killed by a
mine, but he did not learn the de
tails.
AWFUL DEATH OF HUNDREDS.
The force of the explosion knocked
a number of Russians down and the
sight of Japanese rifles, water bottles,
legs "and arms hurtling* through the
lighted space range of the search
light -was an 'awful spectacle. Some
rocks landed Inside the Russian lines.
There was one appalling moment,
during which the garrison Itself was
stunnedâ then a- deathlike silence. The
searchlight coldly lighted up the road
and hillsides, strewn with dead.
The following day the Russians
buried the dead, but owing to their
dismembered and mutilated condition
they were unable to accurately esti
mate the number of killed. A few Japa
nese escaped.
The indications of Japanese activity
in this vicinity put the Russians on
guard. Near midnight the outposts
rushed in and reported that the Japa
nese were approaching. The Russians
withheld their flre for some time. Sud
denly they threw a searchlight up the
valley.
The Japanese opened with a rifle fire.
The Russians continued to wait until
apparently the whole Japanese column
was in the danger' sone. Then the
mine was exploded.
- CHEFU, Friday, Sept. 9, 1:30 a. m.â
A Japanese column numbering ap
proximately 700 men. while marching
along at night on a road in the valley
between Long Hill and Dlviiion Hill,
near Port Arthur, met with a frightful
disaster through the explosion of an
electric land mine on September 1.
The mine was carefully laid by the
Russians three weeks. ago. It covered
nearly a mile of available marching
space. The explosive was placed at
the bottom. Rocks were placed next
and on top of these clay was packed
so carefully that the ground gave the
impression of not having been dis
turbed.
the east and west of the works and
the Russians allowed them to approach
to within a short distance, when they
opened a heavy flre and compelled the
Japanese to retreat after three hours'
fighting. An Incident of the engager
ment was a clash between Japanese
and Russian regiments of cavalry, re
sulting in thÂ« retreat of the former.
Apparently well-informed Japanese,
who reached Chefu from Port Dalny
to-day, report that the Japanese army
before Port Arthur is preparing to
make another assault on the fortress.
Japanese agents here are sending to
Port Dalny 70,000 gunnysacks and en
deavoring to procure 60,000 more. It is
reported that these sacks are to be
filled with sand and used to fill up por
tions of the moat protecting the Rus
sian right flank.
The Chinese report that the Russians
are paying SO cents each for unex
ploded shells manufactured for use dur
ing the Chinese-Japanese war. The
persistency of this report during the
past two weeks entitles It to considera
tion as indicating a shortage of large
ammunition at Port Arthur.
The last copy of ..the Nova Krai
which- has reached here shows evidence
of an Increasing severity of the Rus
sian censorship. Although it mentions
that the Japanese have occupied new
positions It does not tell how they won
them.
Chinese report that oats and straw
for the Japanese horses are getting
scarce. The Japanese ammunition de
pot at Lltungau has been ; destroyed
by Russian shells."
From August 27 to August 29 the
Russians buried under a severe fire
700 decomposing Japanese bodies on
the northeast front, in order to pre
vent a pestilence. ?
A letter reaching Chefu from Port
Arthur says that the Russians axe dis
tilling sea water, as the Japanese have
cut off the reservoirs In the Etzshan
hills. \v -
It was observed by the Russians that
the Japanese were building a battery
to the left of Orphan Mountain. At 8
o'clock batteries were posted on this
position by the Japanese and firing was
begun. The firing was directed chiefly
against Kurgan fort. All night the
Japanese bombarded along the whole
east front, directing their flre against
the roads behind the batteries, with the
evident Intention of ? destroying the
roadway by which guns can be re
moved in case the Russians are driven
from the forts.
During August 2? a peculiar contrast
to the warlike proceedings on the east
flank was presented on the west flank
by the Chinese, who bad resumed work
in the fields as though war did not ex
ist. - -The Chinese, who have grown ac
customed to the 'firing, paid no atten

1 ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. ?. 2:1*
a. si.â Besides the formation of two
fresh errsy corps as the first answer
to the Japasese success at Liaoyang
the Russian er=y at the front will be
reorganized, probably ,!n the form of
two armies, ia command of General
Licevltch axd General Barcn Kaul
bars. respectively, with General Kuro
patkin as commander in chief. Gen
eral Kaulbars will go out with the
two army corpe now organizing in the
Governments of Kazan, Odessa, Vilna
and Kieff. General Linevitch has been
ordered by telegraph from Vladivostok
to Mukden. This decision is due in part,
doubtless, to the growing unwieldlness
of the big force under General Kuro
patkin's command, which will be large
ly increased by reinforcements.
General Kuropatkln heretofore has
handled every detail of the vast organ
ization. Tbe work is tco much for onÂ«
rcaa. however, and he is now almost
broken down under the strain. It is
krown that the Emperor is personally
one c' Kuropatkin's strongest support
ers ard the general, in all probability,
will retain chief command of the two
armies. . Kuropatkin, howe\'er. has
been seriously criticized by some of the
Emperors clo*e military advisers, and
z: is possible that he may eventually be
superseded. '
There is little information from the
front to-night- A dispatch from Muk
den, bearing Thursday's date, repeats
the story of bad reads, which have
hampered the transports, and intimates
tiAt there is an Intercepting movement
toward Tiding.
It is understood that the Emperor*
inspection cf the Baltic fleet at Jvron
stadt to-day is the last he will make
end that the fieet. when it leaves
Libau, will proceed to the Far East.
ST. PETRESBURG. Sept. 8.â A Rus
sian correspondent of the Associated
Press, hi a graphic description of the
fighting at Liaoyang, says:
"Only the Russian soldiers* tradi
tional splendid Qualities enabled then
to support the terrible conditions, of
which the lack of sleep was the most
unbearable. The Japanese availed
themselves to the- utmost of rain and
darkness and did not cease fighting,
their night attacks testing Russian en
durance severely. , The Japanese suf
fered terribly, but made light of their
losses. They continually drafted fresh
reserves into, the ranks to replace the
worn-out men.
"Indeed, jbe numerical superiority of
the Japanese Is astounding and incom
prehensible, for, after losing enough
men at Port Arthur and elsewhere to
form a perfect army, their, effective
strength appears only to increase, and
they still are concentrating fresh
bodies of troops on the L4ao River.
"The battlefield was a perfect in
ferno. Genera] Stakelberg was wound
ed, but, . defying j death,, he remained
immovable at bis post throughout the
day, regardless of the rain of shot and
shell around him. Several officers of
his staff were killed or wounded. In
the evening General Stakelberg noti
fied General Kuropatkin that he could
hold the position or take the offensive
if necessary.
"Among the incidents of the day was
the slaughter of two Japanese battal
ions which were pursued through the
Chinese corn and grain to Saitsa and
surrounded by the Russians. They
resolutely refused to accept quarter,
preferring death.
"In another part of the field the Jap
anese shelled and captured by assault
one of the Russian trenches, only to
find too late that it had been aban
doned by the . Russians and occupied
by their comrades. They fell upon the
prostrate bodies and flooded them with
tears.
"In one case a party of Japanese
officers found a body of their men re
tiring in disorder and drove them back
to the battlefield at the point of the
sword.' -.â¢--(
"The Russian -frontier guards -died at
.their, posts, refusing to surrender. It
was the anniversary of the creation of
their regiment, which they had cele
brated the previous night. . They lost
a large proportion of their officers.
""At many points the combatants
stoned one another.
"Of late the Russians have learned
to mask their batteries more effectively
and thus have gained a sensible ad
vantage over the Japanese. The Rus
sians worship their guns. General
Kuropatkin's admonition is: 'Soldiers,
die for your guns as you would for
your flag!'
"The pits which the Russians had
dug in the Chinese corn and the .grass
were filled with Japanese corpses,
which were trodden over by their
comrades. The ground was so thickly
strewn with bodies in one fight that
the Japanese raised a white flag and
sought permission to bury their dead,
but this was refused. The air became
polluted with the stench.
"The Russian evacuation of the forts
and entrenchment? was carried put
without loss. The troops cr. the
river on pontoon and railway bridges
in perfect order.-
"The Russian tactics at Liaoyang
were a revelation, for which Oku had to
pay dearly."
Describing the failure of some of the
Japanese infantry attacks, the corre
spondent says:
"The Japanese art of war counsels
persistence and they have material
that can be persistent. Despite the
failure of the first attack on the 30th,
the cold gray of the morning wit
nessed another scene of slaughter on
the Russian right as the defend
ers again hurled back the attack. The
Japanese deserved success, but an en
fiiading fire swept each rush before
the men could even lay hands on the
entanglements."
OKU ORDERS THIRD ASSAULT.
Graphically picturing the ebb and
row of the conflict on August 31, the
correspondent continues:
"Oku/, was growing desperate.
From the position . of the Fifth Divi
sion it was evident that the Tenth Di
vision and Kuroki were making, no
headway, so Oku determined upon the
tl-ird general asault on that, night.
Just think of itâ a third asault' In
j "That evening the remaining Rus
sians in the trenches still kept the
Japanese at bay, but the iron-minded
Oku. little reckoning that his fierce
assaults had already cost close upon
20.090 men, determined upon a final
enveloping on this stubborn rear guard.
The last reserves were pushed in and
at 3 o'clock in the morning, after five
days of the most severe fighting the
world has seen since the American
Civil War, the Japanese army seized
the railway bridge and was in occupa
tion'of Liaoyang."
Tbe corresiKjndent adds:
"No resource known to modern en
gineering for field work had been over
looked. It was evident at the outset
that . Oku's previous successes had
caused him to despise the staying pow
ers of the enemy, for without waiting
for adequate preparations he pushed
his infantry down to the limit of the
standing crops, which had not come
under the Russians' precautionary
sickles.
LIAOYANG CAPTURED.
"We had evidence that Liaoyang
would be abandoned, but it seemed
certain that,- though defeated and
forced by superior numbers and su
perior artillery, and to some extent by
superior troops, Kuropatkin had in
turn defeated Japanese strategy, for,
as far as we could learn or judge by
the direction of the fire, Kuroki was
still fighting to get astride the Rus
sian communications.
â¢"The casualties of the Japanese in
five divisions, at the lowest compila
tion, were not less than 10,000 and
there were probably many more, for,
owing to the crops of millet, many of
the wounded have not been found and
they must have died miserably, while
many bodies will never be found until
the crops are cut.
"It is impossible to estimate the
Russian losses, which probably were
half those of the Japanese. It must
be remembered that my estimate of
the latter does not include the Tenth
Division of Kurokl's army."
The correspondent refers to one of
Oku's artillery attacks as one of the
most severe concentrated artillery
fires the world has ever seen. Every
gun belonging to two of the Japanese
corps was trained in rapid fire on the
left of Kuropatkin's position. The
correspondent says:
'"It was a magnificent and withal
an awe-inspiring spectacle. The Rus
sian go-downs were set on fire, as were
the station buildings, and nothing
could live under the attack. The end
of the Russian resistance had come,
and the Japanese gunners rested from
the devastation and slaughter, "when
suddenly, out of the midst of the
smoke and murky dust left from the
reeking shrapnel, came counter flashes
from two or three Russian batteries.
One was almost inclined to cheer, but
it seemed that it was their last ef
fort â a magnificent farewell to the
enemy whom they had balked for so
long. !
"I will not dwell upon the sickening
and harrowing sights of the battle
field, except to mention one incident:
The Japanese stonners had penetrated
the highest trench and had overpow
ered the Cossacks holding it, but Rus
sians from a splinter-proo* shelter be
hind had fallen with their bayonets on
the gallant Japanese in the moment of
their success and the bodies of both
Japanese and Cossacks were piled thick
upon each other in a hideous heap.
ENORMOUS CASUALTIES.
"The general impression was that we
had only to advance and occupy the
town, but Generals Nodru's and Oku's
armies required a day's rest. In fifty
hours Oku had made four general as
saults, which had failed, and we had
subsisted through the Inclement weath
er on rations carried on the person,
while reserve ammunition required re
plenishing.
â¢The Russians had fallen back in
good order, taking with them every
thing except some -00 of their latest
dead, while the only prisoners to fall
into the hands of the Japanese were
geven men who were entombed in an
observation mine casemate on a brush
covered hill. A Japanese storming
party had piled sandbags over the edi
fice of the casemate. It was ah extra
ordinary incident, for the entombed
Russians had ehot two officers who
wished to parley with them and
eventually surrendered thirty-six hours
later, in a horrible state.

tol was attached to one end of the wire
end the pistol was directly under the
big charge of dynamite.
Romain was waiting In the room with
ethers Tvh*n the train pulled up to the

SALT LAKE, Utah, Sept. 8. â The
Democratic State convention to-day
nominated James H. Moyle of Salt
Lake for Governor and Judge O. W.
Powers of Salt Lake for Congressman
and adopted a platform, which, be
sides Indorsing the national platform
and approving the nomination of Par
ker and Davis, reflects the renewal of
charges of church interference in
Utah politics and the ' reorganization
of an anti-church party by denying
the right of any power to dictate po
litical nominations. The convention
was harmonious. Judge Powers' nom
ination for Congress was made by ac
clamation and Moyle had. a large ma
jority, of the votes for Governor over
William C. Roylance and R. S. Wells.
The platform, which was adopted
amid much cheering, contained the
following plank:
The Democratic party neither seeks nor fears
the interference of any ecclesiastical power
with tlfe expression of popular will at the
polls, and denies the right of any power or
of any man orÂ«any set of men to dictate polit
ical nominations or to control political con
ventions. We hold that American citizens are
politically free and equal, and the people
alone should wield this power.

speak In Ogden and Salt Lake City.
He will visit Cheyenne and-then come
through Nebraska for a big meeting in
Omaha. v The remainder of the time
will be spent in the Middle West.
There are many Indications that the
Republicans will elect a solid delega
tion of eight Representatives from Cal

that Frank Flint of Los Angeles is the

United States. Â«Â¦
Precinct registration in San Fran

and the Republican State Central Com

efforts to bring to the mind of every

there is something akin to apathy in

that they are not giving close atten

. Judge Parker's speech was j listened

most of his .speech, ; and; made "no de
parture from the written text. T Â¦
The Democratic party is not, a machine;. 1 it
Is a body of citizens who believe that on the
whole ; its â¢ fundamental .principles are -best
adapted to the conduct of the Government. .
Amnnr so many - patriotic and intelligent
men it is Inevitable, that. divergence .of opinion
as to. minor questions and differences of view
as to the. correctness of the disposition of dead
issues should ' be Â¦ found. - - The < party | is con
cededly .united to-day as to every vital article
of ! faith which can reasonably- enter | into the
pending , canvass. . . . Â¦_ . ... . . J _ ..
Our adversaries are entrenched in full pos
session of i every department ; of > the Govern
ment, and 'it is a mistaken policy Â¦. that will
drive away voters 'â who 'would "help- to oust
them. '- The cause, cannot be Â¦ advanced . by at
tacks on others within r the party .with. whom
we have had disagreements,' but who' are now
working .with "us for a common 'result. â¢â¢. '
All. men who, have- attained any degree of
prominence have their friends and the. exercise
of : ordinary prudence forbids the alienation of
allies who are willing and anxious to assist.
The coming election is not to be ! determined
by. the September vote In ' hopelessly Republi
can States, whera local Issues and candidates'
even are previously handicapped, -but the re
sult in Vermont on- Tuesday admonishes us â
and v there can be no harm in giving .voice to
the admonition â that harmonious 'co-operation
of- all and the elimination of .personal, fac
tional and unimportant: differences.- involving
no â¢ surrender * of ;.Â» principle. K are â¢ essential to
SUCCeSS. Â¦;Â¦; f .Â¦.'Â»â¢' ;--. â¢Â¦V"./ ' â¢ â¢'.â¢...Â¦.;
The sturdy honesty, marked ability and thor
ough devotion to principle of all those in high
placer -durlnc those Democratic administra
tions may. without hesitation, be placed along-,
side, of the qualifications: of similar officials
in any and all other administrations. Who,
I pray you, would hesitate to compare' the
members of the Cabinet of those years with
the. present one, or with any one? Is the
fame of Bayard, Falrchlld, Kndicott, Whitney.
Vilas, Dickinson and Garland, members of the
18S* Cabinet, and Olney, Carlisle, Lament.
Smith, Francis, Herbert, Blssel, Wilson and
Harmon, of that of 1892. dwarfed when con
trasted with the Cabinet officers of to-day ?
WhÂ«n tho comparison Is once ' completed you
will be eager to ask the people: "Which Is
the better?" ; They will declare the victor in
the contest between administrations to be: the
one which," in addition to other excellencies,
saved many millions a year to the nation.'.
Extravagance is running riot in Federal,
State and municipal- governments In spite of the
well-directed efforts of some excellent officers.
The indebtedness of the" municipal governments
are 'steadily -piling 'up. bond issues are .in
creasingly frequent ' and the people hare > not
the satisfaction In many Instances of a full
equivalent in improvements for the money ex
pended. I And the Federal Government is lead
ing in the race of great. expenditures â¢
Ere 'long- the- people will, demand, a reform
in administrative expenses. And they will do
it now if they; are made to appreciate the
whole truth. - ' â¢'â¢Â¦..'. Â¦ . . .
The comparison will ahow that under Dem
ocratic control the administrative purity of the
fathers was observed > in the conduct of the
government; that no ons of its departments
was permeated as of late with corruption riv
aling, the days of Star Route frauds; that a,
successful effort was made to check the growth
of expenditures; that it resulted In each In
stance in cutting down the expenses within
control of the - executive department of the
Government below â¢ the preceding administra
tions. The comparison will show also that
each succeeding Republican administration
after 1S68 increased expenses,, and in some
instances so greatly as to indicate reckless ex
travagance and .waste of the people's money.
During Mr. Cleveland's first term the av
erage annual expenditures were about (259,000,
000. For the past three years it has been about
$510,000,000. The Government expenditures last
year amounted up to $5S2,0OOv00O, which is not
equaled by any year since the Civil War, with
the exception of the year of the Spanish war.
There is an inevitable result to such ex
travagance. Instead of a surplus in the an
nual receipts of about $80,000,000. which the
present executive found on assuming control,
there !s now a deficit to be found there of
512.000,000. . ; ' â¢
The limits of this address will not permit
a further reference to the cost of administra
tion, but it should receive careful examination
at your bands. And you will bi convinced
that "reform is necessary" â aye, far more nec
essary than in 1876 â in the scale of public ex
penses, and. when convinced, you will 'do less
than your duty. if you fall to make the peo
ple understand It.
The challenge of the Republican platform
permits you to compare the details, the every
day life, so to speak, of the Democratic ad
ministrations with both precedenttve and suc
cessive administrations and you will not shrink
from it.
1 . shall not take up your time, .however,
with any â¢ reference r to the great Issues upon
which our party, through its platform . and
candidates,, confidently appeals to .the people
for Indorsement, but 'crave your Indulgence
while I briefly refer to a single feature of the
platform, of .the Republican party..
That platform opens with a declaration of
tha,t party's many years of control of. Goverh
ment, coupled with the assertion that It "has
displayed a high capacity for rule and gov
ernment, which has been made even more
conspicuous by the incapacity and infirmity
of purpose shown by Us opponents." â¢ *
This challenge to a comparison of Demo
cratic and Republican administrations since
the Republican party came Into existence
should be welcomed. ! Fortunately we have
eight recent years of Democratic administra
tion of the executive department of the Qov
ment, which we will gladly compare with any
similar .period since 1860. _ . ...:..:.._..
. There are questions of great Import to be
passed upon by the people In November, ques
tions, that. It will, be your duty, and,, there
fore, I am sure, your ' pleasure as well, to
present honestly and so clearly that the people
will understand them. Â¦
Though the Instant Judgment of the people
may be often at fault, the ripe and final de
cision Is always for the right. And the part
of leadership Is to know the right aad to
honestly, patriotically, fearlessly and zealously
advocate It. Just as long as the press can
discern and 'lead the unhurried and well-con
sidered judgment of -the people, so long will
Its power grow mightily, and so long will It
hold Its place In the front rank of the .unfal
tering and vigorous march of national progress.
To the upbuilding of the power of the' press,
and to the best use of, that power, you bava
devoted yourselves. '
ESOPUS, N. T., Sept.. 8.â Judge Par
ker to-day received pledges of loyal
support from editors of more than 200
Democratic newspapers, representing
chiefly the Middle West and South.
The speeches were delivered â¢ at, the
edge of the Rosemount veranda. After

Josephus Daniels of Raleigh, N. C,

was some time before "the applause

It is Indeed a *rÂ«Â«t pleasure to welcome
to Rosemount this body of representatives of
the great American press, one of the mÂ»t"nueÂ«t
forces in thÂ» upbuilding and Â¦ strengthening
of a. sturdy American citizenship. You Dave

in this campaign may be as effective as"T?oÂ»

must always Increase the efiectiveness : of the
common endeavor of many hands. v .*v*; .' :
The leaders who have made a thoroughfare
through history, down which In all the centu

have all been men who, though not moved by
hasty expression of the hurried Judgment .of
the people were yet guided in all their public
acts by the knowledge of .what the direct and
mature Judgment- of -the people -would be. So
the great' papers , are those: which anticipate
the careful Judgment of the , majority. The
great tribunal of the American people may
be implicitly relied on. to decide all- questions
with unerring and exact Justice when all the
evidence is in and deliberation had. and those
who would hold place as leaders . of . the peo
ple must be so thoroughly American, so dis
creet, eo far-sighted and so sura of the pulse
of the' people as to discern the course public
opinion will take. ' . .'

OAKLAND. Sept. 8.â Two very charming
Oakjand, girls brld,eÂ».^hla evening, the
p'icluresque" lYultvale'liomi'^of 'the William
Anguses being the scene of one wedding, while
oh Twenty-secorid'street tbV eldest* daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Shay was plighted â¢ to
the man of . her choice. Both weddings occur
ring at identical moments were of more> than
usual interest, as the two' "families arÂ» each
the center of a large circle of friends.
Miss Alice Angus and Arthur Louis Bro
deur were united in marriage this evening at
8:30 o'clock by the Rev. William Carson Shaw,
pastor of. the- Church of the Advent and the
artistic arrangement of palms and trailing
clematis formed an effective background for aa
unusually pretty wedding picture. The bride's
gown of white point d'esprlt was a graceful,
fluffy creation. "elaborately trimmed with Alter
nate ruffles of silk and lace. Ruchlngs of
lace outlined the lace yoke and berth*, and
over all fell the rare old point lace veil that
had been worn by the bride's mother on a
similar occasion. The bridal bouquet waa of
Bride rosea.
TWO WEDDINGS
At the place where Rae claimed the
rtolen goldtiad been buried, not a trace
of it waa uncovered. The expectant
trio were as doomed to disappointment
as were the men of the olden time who
are said to have searched for pots of
gold at the foot of the rainbow.
Cronln and Boyd held a long inter
view with Chief of Police Hodgkins
this morning. They were reluctant to
say what had t>ecome of Rae. But they
told Hodgkins that their search had
utterly failed. Rae. apparently confi
dent, had guided the officers to the
hillside hiding place. He had told them
that twelve years ago -when the plun
der was hidden, a broken-handled
ehovel had been used to dig the hole
in the ground. Sure enough the shovel,
rusted and weather-beaten, was found,
also several pieces of rusted sheet iron,
which, it was said, had been used by
the Judson robbers as body shields
against bullets. These iron sheets were
similar to one that was found In the
buggy which the robbers abandoned
after a long drive through Oakland
after the theft was accomplished.
The three men dug around the epof
that Rae had pointed out. But all of
the digging was In vain. Rae could of
fer no explanation about the failure.
He could only say that some one had
found the gold before the searching
party arrived. Cronin and Boyd were
very guarded in their statements.' The
failure had left them In an uncom
municative frame of mind. In fact
Cronin was ready to make flat-denial to
the public that Ills mission to the north
had anything to do with gold seeking.
To the police the visitors' were not
quite so guarded, and to Hodgkins was
confided the tale of treasure trove that
w as not realized. .

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
The bush fire which broke out yes
terday morning on the Magee ranch,
in Redwood Canyon, - is still beyond
control and despite the efforts of near
ly one hundred volunteer fire fighters
continues to spread. Just after the fire
started it destroyed a large barn on
the Magee ranch.
The wind is now driving the flames
toward Leona Heights and there is
danger that the wood around Mills Col
lege may take fire. If this happens
the buildings of the college will be ex
posed to great danger. The extreme
heat of the last two days has rendered
grass and underbrush in the path of
the fire a& dry as tinker and this, aided
by the wind; makes the task of sub
duing the flames difficult.
As the air became cooler after the
sun had gone down, a breeze sprang up
which fanned the flames, which, in
spite of the efforts of the fire fighters.'
swept on toward Leona Heights. In
its course the fire passed within
1500 feet of the buildings of Mills
College, and some \ of the timber
around the grounds caught fire, but by
the hardest kind of work the college
was saved. â Sweep'ing-up the hill the
flames reached the old Stockton Hotel,
which with its outbuildings was to
tally destroyed.
All possible methods were used to
check the flames but without success.
The fire reached the home of Mrs.
Ryer on. upper Cemetery avenue, and
in a few moments the house and barn
were burned to the ground.
At midnight the fire had reached, the
upper portion of Sausal Creek,
here the volunteer fire, brigade Is using
every endeavor, to check the. flames.
Just across the creek, directly in the
path of the flames, are cottages occu
pied by the families of Messrs. Hunt,
Gray and Wagoner, and unless. the fire
is extinguished these are doomed.
Two hundred men from all parts of
the surrounding country are out fight
ing the flames, but so far they have
been unsuccessful ln : making any im
pression on the fierce conflagrations'

The duty of citizens to register and
express their best judgment at the polls
Is the subject of a letter written by
Governor George C. Pardee to Deputy
County Clerk S. N. Wyclcbn*, who has
charge of the registrations of voters. In
answer to a report sent him on the
seeming apathy of the people of Ala
meda County to register. The Gov
ernor admits that it may be an incon
venience to register and go to the polls
to vote, but he says upon the sense
of duty which impels citizens to do this
the stability of Government depends.
While the estimated number of voters
in the county is 35,000, only 23,000:have
registered so far and but twenty days
more are left.
Upon this subject Governor Pardee
expresses himself as follows:
SACRAMENTO, September 6, 1904.
Hon. 8. N: Wyckoff, County Clerk" a office,
Oakland. Cal. â My Dear Sir: Answering -youns
of September 3. I am a little bit disposal to
be ashamed of tbe good people of Alameda
County on your showing- of their neglect to
register in order that they may vote at. the
coming election. It Is, of course, the duty of
every American citizen to e&rcl&Â« hie rlgat
of franchise In every election. If he neglects
to do that he Is not a flrst-classi citizen and
Is neglecting his duty to his country. In time
of war everybody Is eager to defend the na
tional honor and uphold the flax. In time cf
peace there la equal necessity for â¢rery citi
zen to do his part toward the election of proper
men to office. In time of war negtoct of duty
te treason; in time of peace neglect cf clvtC
duty Is equally treason:
The people of Alameda County are as patri
otic as those of any community In the world.
They are intelligent, and, in every way, worthy
of being called "good American I citizens."
liut If they neglect to register .they will be
Justly accused of not being as good American
citizens as they, should be.^ 'â¢ Â¦*-'
Of course It Is somewhat of an inconvenience
to register. and vote. But no man. should hesi
tate to inconvenience himself- to do that which
is his duty and upon which depends the abso
lute stability and perpetuity of the American
nation. And I feel sure that Alameda County
will not permit it to be said of her that her
people are not good citizens. They always
have 'done their duty, and' I am sure they
always will. Very trmly your*. ... .

I "The action of Governor Sparks is
j attributed by Yerington to political
â¢ motl\*es, as part of the scheme to de
! feat him for Congress. Prior to his
Â¦ nomination for Congress, Yerington
says, he received repeated assurances
from Governor Sparks that an addi
tional appropriation would be forth
coming when needed. Yerington holds
that instead of discrediting him, the
programme adopted by the State ad
ministration will only operate as a
'roorback 1 when the facts become
known. He is chiefly interested at
present in saving the State from with
drawing from the exposition.
"President Francis has informed
I Governor Sparks that the charges of
money being wasted are groundless and
that the State exhibit is among the
best at the fair, considering the small
" appropriation. . Charles M. Reeves.
chief of domestic exploitation, will take
up the subject with Governor Sparks,
supplying him with figures bearing out
President Francis' statement."

crat says: "Nevada's appropriation for
the World's Fair has been exhausted
and unless the State makes an ad
ditional appropriation Immediately the
I State building and the State exhibit
'will be* closed within a few days. /The
, announcement was made yesterday by

ST. PAUL, Sept. 8.â Reports received
In St. Paul to-day, coming from a re
liable source, state that L. R. Man
ning, of Tacoma has informed railway
officials at that point that he is the
personal representative of John T.
Woodward, president of the Hanover
National Bank of New York City, a
Rockefeller Institution, and that deeds
to all the Seattle and Tacoma prop
erty which he has acquired during the
past . six months- are in President
Woodward's hands. -
President Woodward, Manning now
says, is acting for a new transconti
nental route, Â¦ to be pushed through
to the Pacific Coast within a short
time. Manning refuses to name the
railway, but intimates that the re
ports that the recent- heavy purchases
of terminals were in the interest of
the Harriman combine were for from
the truth.
CHICAGO, Sept. 8.â One in every
three school children In Chicago, it is es
timated, is a victim of some form of ner
vousness, mild or ' aggravated. : This is
the finding of public school pedagogues
after observations extending more than
a year. The prevalence of nervous dis
orders among children is attributed to
the following causes:
Strenuous city life.
Impure city atmosphere.
The bringing up of children in flat
buildings. S^''- f'^^'f,
No relief from noise, day or night.
Lack of proper nutrition.
Late hours permitted by parents.
Residence along cable and trolley car
lines. " '.''iy -':'::-.
The finding is based on statistics col
lected in every part of the city. Of 300
pupils examined by the child study de
partment of the School Board during
the last year,' a large majority of defec
tives were found to be sufferers from
diseases of the nerves. According to the
assistant supervisor of the child study
department, the nervous affections
usually took one of two formsâslug
gishness and mental - depression with
tendencies toward melancholia, or un
controllable nervous twitchings.

CAUSES ARE NUMEROUS
Alfred Schwartz, boiler-maker, lives
In the 100 block on Fairmont street
and so does Miss Gertrude Johnson
and her mother. To make the coin
cidence even more â¢ remarkable, both
Mr. Schwartz and .Miss Johnson are
pigeon fanciers and maintain rival
coops. "'When fourteen of the Schwartz
pigeons abandoned their home . and
took up residence with the Johnson
birds Mrs. Schwartz . hotly accused
Miss Johnson of having exercised siren
arts to lure away his property, . and
when the young lady and her mother
warmly resented the imputation Mr.
Schwartz exploded â¢ some language
that good breeding -prohibits In the
presence of the gentler sex. That hap
pened last Saturday, afternoon.
David Lynch, car repairer, called to
visit Miss Johnson last Sunday.- after-
Alfred Zollner of 2204 Stelner
street complained that .Theodore
Frank of San Diego was neglecting his
2-year-old son, Basil, but Mrs. . Al
freda C. Frank, wife of the accused,
wrote from San Diego to notify Judge
Mogan that she would like to have the
charge dismissed, as she had person
ally investigated the matter and found
that Basil was very weir taken care
of by his male .parent. Dismissal or
dered accordingly. _ â¢
"Was the main event much of a
fight?" inquired Judge Mogan, before
whom Master Woest was charged with
malicious mischief.
"Naw," was the answer; "Wolff
didn't show and his substertoot wuz
punched out in de third."
"I think you have been sufficiently
punished by witnessing such a no ac
count scrap," said the Judge, and
Master Woest went free.
While the amateur boxing exhibition
was in progress at Woodward's Pa
vilion last Wednesday evening, Henry
Woest, about 16 years of age, burst
open a side door of the big structure
and thus obtained free admittance for
himself and a number of companions.
Judge Cabanlss ordered Eugene H.
Bruce, a lather, to pay his divorced wife
iS a month for the support of their
six-year-old daughter. When the
Bruces were separated by .the Superior
Court the parents of the little one were
instructed that they could alternate in
taking care of her, the father to have
her for. six months and the mother to
be the child's custodian the remainder
of the year. The .' father remarried.
while the mother remained single* and
supported herself and the child by
doing housework, earning about $30 a
month. As she found her salary in
adequate to provide the little girl with
food, clothing and necessary medical
attendance, she enlisted the aid of Mrs.
John Pettle, president of the Universal
Service Society, to compel the father to
contribute to its maintenance, as he
was earning $3.60 a day and had only
his second wife to provide for.
Bruce offered to relieve the mother of
the child's care entirely, but the mere
suggestion of being separated from
her daughter made the woman burst
into hysterical weeping. Her equanim
ity was restored by the Judge's order.
Mr. Demar's tale was repeated to the
chief of detectives, and some of the
best talent in that official's corps was
put to work on the case. - ..,
It was in a saloon somewhere near
the intersection of Sixth and N Market
streets that Mr. Demar met misfortune.
He had spent the greater portion of
the night in a Mason street restaurant
with some friends, three women and
two men, and when the party broke up
they left him at Sixth and Market
streets, his intention being to go to his
apartment at 32 Golden Gate avenue.
Fate, however, prompted him to take
a drink k before retiring, and he went
into a saloon for that purpose. He car
ried a bouquet which his friends had
given him,' and as he stood at the bar
some men who were present began to
help themselves to the flowers. When he
objected to the larceny, one of the men
struck him on the* eye and Demar ran
from the place, engaged a hack and
was driven to the Emergency Hospital,
where the injured optic was attended
to. Then he re-entered the carriage
and rode back to the saloon. He called
for a drink, he avers, and does not re
member exactly what happened after
that, although he has dim recollec
tion of having been dragged into 41 rear
room. It was at 6:30 o'clock that Spe
cial Policeman Donohue found /him
fighting with the attaches of a res
taurant on Sixth street, near Steven
son. His coat was off, and he was ap
parently crazed.
"This is a most unfortunate occur
rence," said Judge Mogan, after Mr.
Demar's story had been told. "It is
apparent that this gentleman was
drugged and robbed, and I hope the po
lice will leave nothing undone that may
lead to the recovery of his property
and the punishment of those who rob
bed him."
There is one visiting Knight Templar
who will need no material souvenir to
remind him of his stay in San Fran
cisco. He is Leo Demar, a wine mer
chant of Boston. Yesterday ' morning
he underwent the memorable experi
ence of being beaten, robbed and ar
rested. One v f his eyes was badly bat
tered and he lost $650 cash and a watch
valued at 5250. Then he was run in for
disturbing the peace, but the prison of
ficials released him when they found
on his person $95 which the thieves had
overlooked. When the evidence was
heard by Police Judge Mogan he dis
missed the case and expressed Sym
pathy for the defendant.
Antone Caredis, peddler of grapes,
swore that he was unable to prevent
the " obstruction of \ Kearny street ! by
his attenuated steedr He used all the
suasive power at his command to in
duce the animal to move on, he said,
but the only response was a more firm
planting of its hoofs and enhanced
rigidity of Its scrawny legs. In a word,
it balked. When' he resorted to cor
poral punishment some of the specta
tors shouted "Shame!" and one old lady
threatened him* with tar and feathers
for cruelty to the dumb beast. A
suggestion that he apply the fire test
was immediately adopted, but when
the horse felt the heat from the blaz
ing paper underneath his abdomen he
moved just far enough ahead to trans
fer the flame to the body of the wagon
arid threaten it with destruction. Then
the policeman appeared and arrested
both man and horse for obstructing a
thoroughfare, and with wonted perver
sity the horse instantly became most
tractable and ! followed its uniformed
custodian as if it were a faithful dog.
"Ah, heaven!" exclaimed Antone, in
conclusion: ' "It Is not the horse,' but
the wicked pig!"
Sentence postponed until to-morrow.
Of course the policeman could not
preserve his official ; dignity and . let
the epithet go unrebuked. He arrest
ed Quong, charged him with peace dis
turbance and had the satisfaction of
hearing Judge Mogan impose a fine
of %o. Yap was in court and eager to
testify, but his* Honor adroitly side
stepped the ordeal. -.-..:'
Quong Gaw and his wife, Yap, broke
away from the custom of their race,
went a-shopplng in the -Caucasian dis
trict and came to grief. They were in
specting oil cloths in a Stockton
street store when Quong and the sales
man became involved in altercation
as to the price bid and asked and Yap
contributed so vociferously to the dis
cussion that Patrolman George Doug
lass dropped in to see what the ar
gument was about and incidentally to
preserve the peace. He gently hinted
jto Yap that the argument could.be ef
fectively maintained without her par
ticipation, and in native Jabber she
asked Quong if he were going to per
mit her to be insulted. Whereupon
Quong swung around and, addressing
the officer, said:
"What fo* you buttee in? You dam
fool! Sabe?"
George H. Kellogg, 6 7 years of age and
looking every hour of it, was accused
or hojding the door of a Stockton
slreet grocery, a la Davy Crockett. in
the wolf scene, and preventing In
gress or egress of customers until a
brawny policeman removed the bar
rier after some difficulty. In defense
of his conduct Mr. Kellogg pleaded in
toxication.
"You are an old man, Mr. Kellogg,"
said Judge Mogan, "but it's never too
late to mend. If you promise to take
a. temperance pledge and keep it, I'll
let you go."
The promise was given with alacrity.
noon, and, of course, he was told all
about the unpleasant conduct of Mr.
Schwartz. When the visitor, was tak
ing his departure .the, ladies escorted
him to the front grate, and, leaning
upon the fence, Mrs. Johnson told him
again of the Schwartz : incident. Mr.
Lynch expressed â¢; sympathy . for the
women and condemnation of Mr.
fcVhwartz. The denunciatory remarks
M'&re apparently audible to their sub
ject, for while Mr. Lynch' was still
holding: forth he was suddenly -and
severely smitten; 1 on the back of the
head by one of j Mr. : Schwartz's fists,
the blow being so forcible as to pros
trate him. Arrest of Mr. Schwartz for
battery. :
The testimony of Miss Johnson and
her mother before Judge : Mogan was
unsparing of Mr.. Schwartz, who was
pronounced guilty as charged and or
dered to appear for sentence to-mor

On Thursday night the residents of Redlands invited the "Holy
Jumpers" to give an example of their agility, and in consequence
fifty of them jumped immediately to Oakland. With a little training,
from the Oakland peopfls they might be made to jump over the
State line.
â¢ An enthusiastic student of heraldry has discovered that the Sage
of Esopus enjoys the inherited right to sport a coat of arms. This
authority gives us details concerning "vert, a chevron, between three
stag's heads cabossed," but he says nothing about an interrogation
point on a "field or."
Recently David B. Hill opened the campaign for his party by
denouncing the President as a fraud in so many words. If this is
an earnest of what his methods are to be, Democrats may well con
gratulate themselves upon the imminence of that gentleman's an
nounced retirement from the political field.
General Stoessel, mewed up in Port Arthur, has been sending
telegrams home urging the Admiralty to get busy with that Baltic
fleet. With our knowledge of the general's command of sulphurous
Russian we may now believe that the electrical storms raging over
the battlefields in Manchuria were precipitated by the transmission
of a few of these wireless messages from the * beleaguered com
mander.
A Welsh gentleman in Pennsylvania, who delights in the name
of Gwffdd Jones, has a contract to furnish a .French manufacturing
house with 10,000 rattlesnake pelts, and he is now busy collecting
the deadly crotalus. The Squehawken Morning Intelligencer of
Squehawken, Pa., asserts that Mr. Jones decoys his victims as one
would decoy ducks, by coiling up on a butternut stump and repeat
ing his given name with metallic iteration. Since this is not made
in the form of a sworn statement, however, we are privileged to
have our doubts. .
HERETOFORE the pear and apple crop of California has been
measurably protected against the ravages of the codlin moth
only by frequent, costly and laborious spraying with Paris
green. This spraying, to be effective, had to be done three times
during the season, before blooming, when the fruit was set and
turned the blossom end upward, and after it turned down.
But even then a heavy percentage of the crop has been lost by
the burrowing into the fruit of the worm hatched from the eggs of
the moth. Every place in the world where the apple and pear
flourish has been subject to the attacks of this insect. The apple
orchards of Nebraska were so devastated by it that as a remedy it
was proposed to destroy successive crops in the entire State by
taking some means to blast the bloom before setting the fruit. Since
the discovery that nature strives to maintain an equilibrium by fur
nishing an insect to prey upon those that destroy crops, it had come
to be accepted as a fact that the codlin moth was exempt, and could
be fought only by the hand of man.
Now, it appears that there is no such exemption, and thanks to
that great Californian horticulturist, Mr. Ellwood Cooper, an insect
has been found that feeds upon the moth, and it is to be introduced
here in time for next season's crop. So far the information about
it is meager. We are not informed at what stage in the development
of the moth it does its work. Presumably, however, it attacks the
egg in the bloom or in the blossom end of the young fruit.
As California produces the standard and best Bartlett pear in
the world, the importance of this discovery cannot be overestimated.
Our dried and canned pears have captured every market to which
they have been introduced. But the supply for both processes of
preservation has been limited by the operations of the codlin moth.
This discovery may have a wider significance than arises in the
fruit crop. If it be found that this beneficial insect attacks also the
gypsy moth, a peril that has long threatened all of our forests may
be averted by it. Mr. Cooper has put the whole horticultural world
under obligation for his agency in this matter.
A MOTH PARASITE.
WOMEN'S CLUBS ARE
SPLENDID HELPS TO
THE FOREIGN ARTISTS
The coming musical season will
bring to the United States the usual
number of virtuosos and the pianists
and the singers and the violinists will
again travel the length and breadth of
the land. Perhaps in some former sea
sons there have been more noted art
ists, but there will be plenty of ma
terial to occupy the attention of the
women's musical clubs throughout the
country.
The majority of the artists who
come here would never be able to
make an American tour but for these
women's clubs, which show how women
can really be useful in advancing the
interests of music without endeavoring
to compose or do other creative things
of the kind.
When an agent visits a city to se
cure an engagement fcr an artist he
goes directly to the president of one
of these clubs. The president, after
hearing nis proposal, puts the ques
tion before the members of the govern
ing committee, and they decide wheth
er or not they can r.fford to pay the
price asked for the artist.
The sum asked may be $200 or it
may be $400. The vomen when they
accept a performer try to t sell the
tickets themselves, giving first choice
to the club members am" letting In the
public afterward.
Without this guarantee and the in
fluence of the club members. jj many
small towns would never hear the
well-known artists. Managers would
be afraid to undertake to give con
certs In small cities where the mu
sical taste is not '. ighly cultivated and
the public is indifferent to high-class
music. All over the country these
clubs have done a wonderful mission
ary work in bringing to the people of
the smaller cities the best of the vir
tuosos. .
It rarely happens that these organiza
tions are not able out of t* eir own
r*sources to pay the honorariums asked
by the great artists, although one club
In a \7estern city last year paid to a
soprano $2000 for a song recital, and
it was, moreover, given only for the
members of the club, the outside pub
lic not beinr admitted at all.
Often women's clubs will in the case
of famous artists pay a certain sum
toward the receipts of the perform
ance, guaranteeing as much as it can
afford and taking the choice of seats.
It rarely happens hat a club can af
ford to pay more than WOO or $700.
These clubs have also developed a
set of women impresarios, who con
trol certain parts of the country and
are able by the skill they use in deal
ing with their own sex to arrange the
engagements of artists on much better
terms. They will take the singers or
players, for instance, to give concerts
in half a dozen cities in a certain ter T
rltory. Then they will journey from
town to town soiling the artists to the
different clubs.
' One of the best known of these wom
en Impresarios controls the entire
Northwest :d managers are always
eager to do business with her, so cap
able has she proved herself. Her prin
cipal value to the managers conies
from the fact that she has the entire
confidence of the musical societies,
which will always take artists on her
recommendation.â New York Sun.

Intended for his use.
California has a brief history, but every line of it is great. Lust
ed after by Russia and by Great Britain, and possessed by Spain as
part of the world-belting empire of Philip the Second, by the law
of political gravitation it was probated to the republic. Prior to
that time it had been a land of mystery. The pioneer padres had
planted the cross upon its soil and striven for the betterment of its
aboriginal races, and th^ dons, owning the vast grants of land, had
covered them with flocks and herds, and led on their domains a
simple, pastoral life, content and without enterprise, and lacking
insight into the higher capacities and greater resources of the land.
Belonging to a gold hunting race that under Cortez had overrun
Mexico, lured by the yellow, glister, and had followed Pizarro into
Peru to ravage the precious treasury of the Incas, here they drowsed
in dignity and state, within arm's reach of a greater store of gold
than the world had known, unsuspecting its existence.
The eastern part of the United States had its imagination fired
by the expeditions of Fremont, the Pathfinder, and when gold was
discovered the tinder gathered by his reports was touched as by a
torch. It was a great confluence of events. The settlement of the
Oregon boundary, the Mexican war, the discovery of gold! Imme
diately it faced hitherward one of the great movements of the race.
Overland they came in wagons, by slow oxen and* fleeter horses ;
they doubled stormy Cape Horn, felt their way through the Strait of
Magellan and braved the pestilence of the isthmian passage. Hun
dreds fell, death smitten by disease, slaughtered by the wild tribes,
wrecked at sea. But the stream flowed steadily on, gathering in
volume, until California became an American community with an
unquenchable aspiration to be an American state.
We know the full significance of the event that is celebrated to
day. But we cannot know the depth and strength of that feeling
which aspired to statehood. California had no Territorial novitiate.
By General Riley's proclamation the convention was elected that met
at Monterey September i, 1849, and adopted a constitution, which
was ratified November 13 of the same year, when a Governor and
Legislature were elected, and the State, with the government so
constituted, was admitted to the Union September 9, 1850. Gov
ernor Burnett, elected before California was a State, served until
his successor was chosen at the State election of 1851.
There was no appointment of a Territorial Governor from
Washington. Californians from the first elected their own govern
ment. The pioneers, met here the lords of a territory without law,
without jurisdiction other than military, proceeded of their own mo
tion to organize American government. It is. a great history, deserv
ing the honors paid to it and to those who made it, on this birthday
of the greatest civil State in the world.
TO-DAY California celebrates, by holiday and ceremony, the an
niversary of her admission into the ynion. The native sons
and daughters of the State, with a birthright in its glory and
honor, lead in this observance. By their grand assemblage and in
their local centers, which are all over the commonwealth, they give
utterance to their pride in the land of their birth, and show forth
a local loyalty that is hardly felt in equal degree in any other State
of the Union, or any country in the world. ' ;"i :
But while these birthright Californians properly lead, their sen
timent is shared by the far larger number who are Galifornians by
choice. This State is peculiar in this, that the population planted
here by immigration finds it in all things so satisfying that, after
a brief sojourn, every one of that class becomes a thorough Cah
fornian. They find the burdens of life more easily borne and its
blessings brighter and more numerous here than elsewhere in the
world, and their loyalty pays tribute to the State ,in which rri?for
tune is better borne and fortune comes by less sacrifice than in the
land thev have known.

City. A young lady should be very
careful in writing letters to men. The
acquaintance with a man running over
a period of only four days, and such
acquaintance having been formed at a
publlo camp, without introduction, does
not warrant a young lady la writing
to him and addressing him In her let
ter as "Dear Mr. â â ," and closing the
letter with "sincerely yours." The man
may have been "apparently well edu
cated and a perfect gentleman in. his
deportment," yet a young lady should
know to whom she Is writing and at all
times should/ be guarded in letter writ
ing. This department refers you to
any of the modern dictionaries for the
definition of "friend", and "acquain

Under all circumstances the under
taking will bring benefits to the girls.
It will tend to awaken a spirit of self
reliance and independence; It will be
conducive to their education; they
will have had an opportunity in com
ing in contact with American working
girls.
The young girls and married women
spent most of their time in their
houses, attending to domestic duties
or sewing. Attending church and
shopping was always done with some
elderly or married person, or perhaps
a male member of the family. Earn
ing a livelihood, except as a seam
stress or in some vocation . common
only to women, was rare, while the
invasion of any field of labor presided
over by men was beyond thought
Americanization, however, has made
great strides in this respect. It is
common to see the girls go alone to
church, shopping or making calls.
There are now female telegraph oper
ators, who have been taught in a
school established by the Government.
There are schools of stenography,
from which girls will soon graduate
and be ready to take positions. A
few are holding Government positions.
Another instance is the ' school
teachers, who In many cases are
teaching in towns far from their
homes. The Normal .School in Bio
Piedras, the only one in the island, U
attended by female students from all
over the island and they have proved
that a chaperon is superfluous.
Now a precedent has been set
which shatters all ideals. Twenty
three girls go to the" United States
from various parts of the Island; a
majority are unknown to, one another.
! Their stay in St. Louis is optional
with ' them. The company has pre
scribed no time for the expiration of
the contract. So long as they wish
to remain the company will furnish
WOTk.
The company has entered upon *V*
enterprise with a confidence that
Porto Rlcans have a natural fitness
for that kind of work. The venture Is
experimental, but if It proves satisfac
tory; more Porto RIcans will be en
gaged. ' r
The recent sailing of twenty-three
Porto Rican girls, bound for St. Louis,
where they will be employed in facto
ries, is a remarkable indication of the
changes which this land has under
gone with the advent of the American
Government. It marks an epoch in
the history of the country.
Prior to the American occupation
the women in the island lacked inde
pendence. The deportment of the
young women, governed by the social
ethics of Spain, was guarded by some
female of the family or a relative,
who acted as sponsor.

He's nothing much to look at when you
see him here in town.
His coat's not in the fashion â it's a but
ternutty brown:
His trousers bag unseemly and they
ready-made were bought;
He doesn't wear a necktie, as all well
dressed people ought;
His hair is somewhat Jagged in the mat
ter of its trim.
And wild, barbaric whiskers are good
enough for him.
I know you would not think It; it is hard
to understand.
But back in Jimson County he's a power
in the land.
To see him in the city almost any one
would say
That he, in common parlance, was a
typical old Jay,
They'd Jeer at his umbrella and bis old
wool, wide-brimmed hat;
The carpet bag he carries, they would
have their fling at that.
His speech would quite amuse them with
its funny rural twang:
They'd smile to see him "rubber," as they
call it in their slang.
The trouble is he's treading on an un
familiar ground.
Uut back in Jimson County, why, he
makes them stand around.
Yes, 'way back there in Jimson you'd ap
preciate his rank;
He owns the elevator; his Judgment runs
the bank.
He's chairman of the County Board, and
when they celebrate
The Fourth, or almost anything, his
speech is simply great.
A citizen of prominence, he's always in
the lead.
They don't laugh at his whiskers there
in Jimson â no, indeed.
He's not much in the city, where he looks
a trifle green.

which Miss Roberts has been reserv

"Marta of the Lowlands" has been
produced in nearly every Latin coun

last winter that the first English ver
sion was presented. The American
jywniier of the play was produced by

one of the biggest successes of the

WASHINGTON. Sept. 8.â Census sta
tistics Just published show that, de
spite' opposition from various sources,
child labor in the United States is
increasing. According to these figures
every fifth child in the country be
tween the ages' of 10 and 15 years is
a bread winner. Of the juvenilu wago
earners every third child is a girl.
There are 1,750,178 children regularly
employed. This is an increase of 33.3
per cent in ten years. Alabama has
the highest percentage of child labor,
finding work for 27.2 per cent of her
children, while Massachusetts has the
lowest, having only 0.5 per cent of
her juvenile population at work. Of
all children employed 26.1 per cent are
boys and 10.2 per cent are girls.
In all of the Southern States the per
centage of children employed Is high.
It Is also high in Western States and
is remarkably low in the East.
The increase of the conditions is
shown plainly by the census figures
of 1880 and 1900. In 1880 the number
of children' employed was 1.118,356. or
16.8 per cent of the entire child popula

OLD ACTRESS
DIES AFTER A
LONG CAREER
Last evening's Overland Limited
brought home to San Francisco a na
tive daughter who- has during* an ab
sence of nearly eleven years on a
place among the highest notables of
the operatic stage. ' Mme. Fannie Fran
cisca concluded her season at the
Royal Opera, Amsterdam, a few weeks
ago, and since that time has been on
her way to this city, where she will In
augurate a limited concert tour.
The only stop en route made by the
celebrated prima donna was at New
York, where she signed some important
contracts for her appearance in the big
grand opera production the coming
winter. She has selected this city as
the starting point of her tour much
through sentiment, as it was here that
the great soprano was born and raised
and now comes back with a reputation
equal to any artist on the. lyric stage.
Paris, Vienna, . Amsterdam, Munich,
Monte Carlo and other musical centers
have made of tha Californian their
particular lyric pet, and her ap
pearances !n ts}ese places have
always been the occasion for
great ovations. Mme. Francisca
will be heard here at the' Alhambra
Theater for two concerts. The first
will be given on Wednesday night, Sep
tember 21, and the second on Saturday
afternoon, September 24. The diva has
a remarkably large repertoire from
which to select her numbers for the
operatic concerts, and her magnificent
colorature- voice will be heard to per
fection in such numbers as the mad
scene from "Lucia" and the great aria
from "Travlata." As Ophelia in the
opera of "Hamlet," the songstress has
won special distinction, and this will
give San Franciscans an opportunity
to hear the mad scene aria sung to per

The Grand Jury yesterday began an
inquiry into the operations of I* B.
McMlllen, who is accused of fixing up
lodging-houses and selling, them to
gullible Investors, who afterward as
certained that the profits would not
pay the rent.
Mrs. 8. M. Packard . was the first
witness. She told how she had pur
chased a lodging-house at 611 Ellis
street from McMlllen and that the
place did not pay. The witness was
unable, however, to furnish any in
criminating evidence. Annie Brldg
man, a Bister of McMillen, told of her
brother's methods in selling lodging
houses, it appearing that he was aided
In his schemes by his daughter. No
action was taken by the Grand Jury.
Secretry Welch announced that the
Grand Jury had received many com
plaints against so-called "get-rlch
quick" concerns and a general invita
tion was extended to all who have
suffered financial loss from these
schemes to come and tell their stories
to the Grand Jury, which is desirous
of returning indictments against any
one criminally liable.

SAN DIEGO, Sept 8.â Chauncey Au
stin, a young man of Chula Vista, was
drowned this evening about 4 'o'clock
in the surf near South San Diego and
his body has not yet been recovered.
Young Austin was about 18 years of
age. He went to the beach opposite
San Diego with other picnickers of the.
Otay Sunday school. There was a large
attendance and a ' number of the boys
were in bathing at a particularly good
stretch of beach only a little distance
this side of the. Mexican line. None
noted the disappearance of the young
man, but when the rest of the swim
mers came out of the water he was
missing. Not a sign of him was to
be found anywhere.
Bandiiii Dear, one of his companions,
recalls being with him in the water
only a short time before coming out
himself and he was surprised not to
find him on the beach with the others.
A number of the young man's ac
quaintances are patrolling the beach
to-night in the hope of recovering- the
body. The current sets south along
the coast there, and it is morej than
likely that the body will be carried
into Mexican waters before being cast
up.

FRESNO, Sept. 8.â William Lindsay
Allen, formerly a college hero in ath
letics at the University q( Michigan, is
wanted by the people of. Selma for
swindlingr them out of many hundreds
of dollars. His victims are not confined
to Selma. San Francisco has its share,
it is said, and many of his old chums
are out small sums.
Allen came to this State with the
"Vyeber and Fields Burlesque Company
last March. He claimed to have start
ed from Michigan, with $5000 and land
ed In Selma with just five cents in his
pocket. "With his excellent bearing and
polished manners, he presented a front
which won him many friends and loans
of considerable money to start him in
business. He represented himself aa
an agent of the Conservative Life In
surance Company and having won the
confidence of Joseph Smith, cashier of
the Selma Bank, was soon signing poli
cies In the bank offices.
In June Allen proposed to his money
ed friends of Selma to fqrm a Pacific
Coast Mercantile and Collection Agen
cy, with headquarters In San Fran
cisco. A half dozen men subscribed
J1000 each to start the affair along.
Headquarters* were established in
rooms 230 and 231 in the Parrott build
ing. Allen bought automobiles, ran
tailor bills there and spent money lav
ishly. When It cam* time to open the
agency he had spent the money In dis
sipation and was not. to be found.

Park. Before they had accomplished
thiÂ« difficult stunt they made a dummy
play that cost a run and then made a
presentation of a pair of them on an
error by Francks. Score â Oakland,
4: San Frtncisco, 3.
Thus a pretty battle of the pitchers
was spoiled. Not a run had been
amassed by either team tHl Oakland
just barely managed to scratch
through with one in the seventh on a
pair of well placed hits and some
rapid work on the bases.
Tommy Leahy ushered in the eighth
with a drive for two to the score
beard. Corbett cracked one out to
right field and Tommy went to third.
Van Buren came up and zing it went
to McKune. He was a trifle slow in
winging the leather to the plate and
L*>ahy was barely safe. Then Hilde
brand sacrificed both Corbett and Van
Buren along.

Several members of the band of thÂ»
First Regiment of the National Guard
of California, fearing that Colonel
Thomas O'Xeil was about to dismiss
them from that body, asked yesterday
for an injunction preventing him from
doing so. They claim that they hava
expended money for the purchase of
musical Instruments and other neces
sities to become proficient members of
the band. O'Xeil says that he ordered
these men to Camp Atascadero, *but
they refused to go, and because of not
going to camp they are afraid of dis
missal.

The following matches were played
yesterday:
The northern -tennis players again
carried off the honors yesterday at San
Rafael. In the semi-finals of the men'j
singles Percy Murdock of Alameda and
Drummond MacGavin of San Fran
cisco disposed of Fritz Overton and
Trowbridge Hendrick, both of Los
Angeles. Murdock and MacGavin will
meet this afternoon to decide which
will play Alfonzo Bell for the cham
pionship to-morrow.
The morning match between Overton
and Murdock was a four-set affair, in
which Murdock, after falling to win
a game in the first set, won the next
three handllv. In the opening set the
man who recently beat Champion
Bell was at his best and Murdock
looked outclassed. Overton, however,
could not keep up the pace, the heat
and dense smoke overhanging the
court affecting him to a great extent.
In the last three sets Murdock played
his best game and, except for a spurt
in the third set, was in no particular
danger of losing. In this set Overton
seemed to get his second wind and
pulled from a 5-0 lead up to 5-4. Mur
dock undoubtedly played great tennis,
but it is only fair to Overton to say he
could have done better had the condi
tions been different.
In thes afternoon MacGavin and Hen
drick met and the former, to the sur
prise of many, won easily. After dla
posing of Hunt on the previous day
many thought Hendrick would win the
tournament, but he was no match for
MacGavin. The latter is playing bet
ter than he ever did and the man who
beats him will have to play some won
derful tennis. He has steadied down*
and also has more self-confidence than
previously. Hendrick played a good
game in his match with MacGavin, but
the latter, kept him in the back court
and had him at his mercy. The match
went in straight sets. The score waa
C-4, 6-3, 6-3.
The mixed doubles event was com
pleted down to the finals in one half
and the semi-finals in the other. By
beating Miss May Sutton and John
Donnell, Miss Florence Sutton and
Fletcher Elliott obtained to the finals.
Miss Dobbins and Percy Murdock
beat Miss Seymour and H. Donnell. The
winners will meet Miss Violet Sutton
and Trowbridge Hendrick in the semi
finals this morning.
The ladies' singles tournament was
finished and resulted in a victory for
Miss Florence Sutton. In the finals she
.beat Miss Hazel Hotchkiss. Many
thought the loser would make a better
showing, but Miss Florence has im
proved since last year and will make
ber sister. Miss May, work to retain
her laurels.

at 25 to 1, yet he all but beat Hamburg
Belle,, arid, if the .race had been'. at,- a

set by Alari-a-Dale. The latter "bore

making stone culverts for railroad
crossings and piers and abutments

Is at the Stony Creek crossing, which
has been this division's source of
gravel supply for many years. The tile
factory was begun as an experiment,
tut it has proved an immense success
and its permanency is now assured.
This gives quite an impetus to the
town of Orland, as a large number of
men will be given employment at the
plant.

For the Antipodes.
LONDON, Sept. 8.â Home Secretary
Akers-Douglas has appointed a com
mission to inquire into the circum
stances of the conviction of Adolph
Beck, who was convicted In 1896 and
served one sentence of seven years,
and who again was arrested and con
victed, but was granted & "free par
don," when . it developed that it had
been conclusively proved that both of
his convictions were founded on mis-'
taken identity. The case has caused
a great sensation, especially in view
of the rearoused interest in the May
brick case, and charges against the
police of conspiracy in order to secure
the conviction of an innocent man are
freely and openly made.
The Government has offered Beck
as compensation . the sum of 110,000.
which he refused on the ground that
It was not sufficient He demanded a
full inquiry, which is backed up by the'
public and press. The case is expected
td develop a further sensation, reflect
ing seriously on the police.
In both Instances Beck was charged
with having obtained money and Jew
elry from women under false pretenses
and his convictions were secured on the
evidence of men who identified him.
Recently, however, a man giving the
name of John Smith was arrested and
confessed that he was the man who
was convicted in 1877 on the same
charge. When Beck was convicted In
1896 It was stated by the police that
Beck was the man Smith who was con
victed in 1877.
ROME. Sept. 8.â The Pope to-day
: ' cived 1500 French pilgrims, mostly
j.nc^ts and nuns, led by M. Harmel,
a well known manufacturer, who de
livered an address to the Pontiff. The
latter, In reply, said the reception was
most Important, being the first French
j-ilgriHsage to visit Rome since the
conflict between France and the Vat
;oan.
In his discourse the Pope thanked
the pilgrims for the loyalty and devo
tion they had manifested, not only in
word, but by d^eds, thus risking hav
ing to make considerable sacrifices. He
added:
"You, descendants of the sons of
France, who were unreservedly faith
ful to the church, devoted to the chair
Â¦f St. Peter and always ready to de
fend and propagate truth and good
:.ess. will not be degenerate heroes.
â¢n cpite of the difficulties and sacrl
:.ces which you must face, be always
jrenerous minded, with the certain
knowledge that you will thus be work
ing not only for your own happiness,
hut for the prosperity of your coun
try."
After reviewing the historic connec
tions between France and the Vatican,
i he Pontiff said:
"France is always; notwithstanding
all that has happened, most dear to
nor heart. If necessary we are ready
to- endure again sufferings to insure
the welfare and greatness of your
conntry."
The Pope concluded with urging the
7>llgrims to remain firmly attached to
the church. The discourse was greet
ed with warm applause. Its modera
tion was much commented upon. It
was compared with the aggressive tone'
nf the recent speech made by French
Premier Combes at Auxerre and it was
considered to be an Indication that the
Vatican has not yet lost hope that
pome understanding may still be ar
rived at with France.

Without a breath of breeze to tem
per the heat the water front sweltered
yesterday in an Eastern summer.
Visitors to the wharves, San Fran
ciscans seeking fresh air, stranger
Knights, pilgrims from the sun-
Btricken Middle Western and Southern
States, took launch for the war vessels
out In the bay, but found no relief. It
was hot all day along the docks.
The harbor lay in quietude, with only
the trans-bay ferry boats to ripple the
placid surface of the water till the out
bound liners Sierra and Coptic, moving
abreast, swung out toward the Golden
Gate. The little white schooner
Halcyon, which came in during the
forenoon from Grays Harbor with lum
ber and anchored west of Alcatraz,
tried to set up some entertainment by
dragging near to the island. There
was no wind, but the strong current
set her toward the shore. Fortunately,
however, the turn of the tide swung
her away from the beach and she es
caped grounding.

Local Inspector Bulger Finds Them
Superior, to the Best Made of
Cork or Other Material.
United States Local Inspector Cap
tain Frank Bulger, assisted by Cap
tain James Guthrie, has just finished
a .test of tule life preservers. The
first lots were twelve year3 old and
were condemned and taken from the
river steamer Captain Weber. They
were placed in fresh water on August
31, at 3 p. m., and taken out yester
day at 3 p. m.,- after having floated
twenty-four v pounds weight each for
the, whole^of that- time. The new
ones, weighing three and a quarter
pounds, floated thirty-six pounds for
ninety-six hours, and twenty-seven
and a half pounds for the same pe
riod. One of these, after , having
supported twenty-four . pounds for
ninety-six hours in the water, was
dried and supported thlrty-twY and
three-quarter pounds dead weight and
stood four and a half inches out of
water. Twenty-four pounds is _ the
weight required by the regulations to
be supported. The regulation weight
for the British Board of Trade is
only fourteen, pounds.-; Hence Brit
ish life preservers are not allowed. on
American vessels. It is estimated that
a man weighs seven. and; a hair pounds
in salt water.

main ' factor in the situation was the ex

complain of the general dullness. The Butter

generally in soft and poor condition owing to
the hot wave, but the northern coast* goods
are thus far holding their own pretty well,

NATIVE SONS WHO WILL TAKE
â¢ , PROMINENT PART IN- THE,CEL
EBRATION. .
At the Reliance Club' a vaudeville
show and high jinks entertained hun
dreds of the visitors to Oakland. Prep
arations were^ , made ,to accornmodate"
the, crowd in the! spacious gymnasium
of L the club, but the. house, accustomed
to seat comfortably'tro'wds that - at
tend, sparring exhibitions 1 and view the
training of Champion Jeffries, .was en
tirely, inadequate to contain . the multi
tude that applied for admission^ Many
were < turned Â«away. .
V A committee' in 'charge of the- jinks
secured, the services or *a number of
the â¢ vaudeville performers ; in the Â¦ local
theaters and the. entertainment, '.con
sisting of songs; recitations "and comic
specialties, lasted until- after midnight
During < the intermission . between the
numbers /. on . the J programme,'.', refresh
ments .were; served and* a' general' good
time was enjoyed; by all. '
Great hosts of strangers last night
for the first time saw. a procession of
.Native Sons of the Golden .West. . The
San Francisco Parlors marched along
Mason, Market, Kearny, -Bush, Mont
gomery and then down Market again
un their way to the ferry to join their
brothers in Oakland in a night parade
and to-day, in the great, day parade in
celebration of the anniversary of the
admission of California into the Union.
Twenty-three parlors .were .repre
sented in the parade by about 1200 Na
tive Sons, who, with banners and, flags,
fireworks and red fire, made an attrac
tive display. .'Â¦:.*Â¦'Â¦
The procession . started from the Na
tive Sons' . headquarters . on "Mason
street and was made up of a Â¦ platoon
of mounted police followed by a band of
music, Â¦; Grand Marshal H. M. , Squires
and. his aids," Company F, N. .G. C.'a

Sequoia, Oiyhiftus,- Presidio, Precita,
Marshal, Army and Navy. El Capitan,
Dolores arid Twin Peaks parlors. ;
Almost every parlor had a' beautiful
banner mounted on wheels,' but there
was no special effort at uniform,decor
ation, except that many of the" parlors
turned out with the regalia .. worn
during sessions, 'while Alcalde Parlor
made a fine showing, preceded, by -its
drill corps in bright military uniform.
A bit of color -was .added "by Twin
Peaks Parlor appearing in-line, the
numbers carrying parasois illuminated
with American flags. In the parade'to
day the members ' of the parlors will
appear in uniform attire. A feature of
the procession wasithe banner ; of El
Dorado Parlor ; mounted on wheels and
drawn by a pair of. diminutive donkeys.
, The night parade was a creditable
one. and the members of the different
"subordinates" of the order must,' by
their appearance' in the march, have
created a very favorable impression on
the very large number of ! strangers
who saw them pass down the line. Â¦
With the- blare of brass bandstand
the firing of .rockets. and bombs "the
San Francisco parlors met at the foot
of Broadway in Oakland and were^es
corted to their several headquarters.
At least 3000 members of the*organ
ization took part in the Oakland /pa
rade and that' city was filled with visi
tors. ' , ,
The visitors were -met by Berkeley
Parlor, which acted as special escort.
At the slip were also Chairman L.' MJ
Cobbledick of the general 'committee
on arrangements; Frank Smith, chair
man of the reception committee; Sen
ator Joseph Knowland of the recep
tion committee. Rod W. Church and
others, who welcomed â¢ the guests in
the name of the city. As soon as j a
line could be formed the march -was'
begun and the procession paraded
through the main business- streets of
the trans-bay city. â¢ Thousands of peo
ple viewed the ; parade .and -many .ac
companied- the guests to the head
quarters of/the, parlors,, where open
house was kept until a late hour. â¢ ".
The freedom of Oakland has been
given the guest's and to-day members

The trained elephants, performing
seals and educated horses are striking
numbers in the big circus programme.
Ringling Brothers are said- never to
have had so big or satisfying a circus
programme as they offer this season.
The street display Monday morning
promises to throng the'streets witlrex
pectant sightseers. The sensational
"thriller" of the circus programme is
the much-talked-of "leaping the gap."
Walter Lowe, the performer, who dares
death by a desperate ride' down' an al
most perpendicular plane about two
feet wide and then flies on his wheel
through Â¦; space for fifty-two feet, land
ing on .a padded incline, has caused
more sensational interest than any dar
ing performance brought forward by
a circus enterprise within a generation.
Among the odd creatures of wild na
ture to be seen in the natural history
department of the great show are - the
only rhinoceros in the country, . two
giraffes, a horned horse, baby tigers,
panthers, forty- elephants , and a real
baby elephant still unweaned. The cir
cus acts will be, given in three rings, on
two stages and amid a forest of over
head trappings. â¢ The hippodrome races
will be run on a track one-fourth of a
mile long.
The big spectacle of "Jerusalem and
the Crusades" will open the perform
ance and last about thirty minutes. The
costuming of this feature is lavish in
the extreme and the music and ballet
specialties, as well as the athletic pas
times introduced, are new; There are
200 girls in the ballet and chorus and
the music is furnished by a band of
fifty pieces and a tremendous portable
pipe organ. '
Nearly all the circus artists are new
to San Francisco, they making their
first appearance in America with Ring
ling Brothers. The four Eldreds from
England, the four ' Bedinis from Italy,
the seven Clinserrettis from Germany,
the Tasmanian troupe from. Australia
and the eight Colini-Cairons from
France are among these.
. The riding feats of the and
Bedinis are novel and made a great
hit in" the long Chicago engagement of
the Ringlings. The Dacoma family,
Dollard troupe. Rio brothers, Fortuns
brothers, flying Fishers, three Alvos,
Tybell sisters, Kauffman family, Jack
son family and Genaro and Theoll are
foremost in a long list of circus celebri
ties. ; -.;>; v." ;.- : ' Â¦'
Ringling Brothers are known in San
Francisco better than any other circus
firm. The show has grown to enor
mous size. The big tent will hold about
15.000 people. The menagerie annex is
almost as big and the animal collec
tion it contains is claimed to be the
most valuable in America.
Ringling Brothers' , circus will arrive
here . early Sunday morning arid will
at once go into camp at Eleventh and
Marlict streets. The big show will be
in San Francisco all of next week and
will give performances every afternoon
and night, beginning Monday. The
street parade will start from the show
grounds Monday morning at 9:30
o'clock.
The mercury in local, thermometers
took a brief rest Wednesday night and
went back to work with vigor yester
day. The maximum temperature regis
tered was exactly 100 degrees Fahren
heit at 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon,
though the gusss of Old Probabilities
said the weather would be "much
cooler." The average temperature of
the day was practically the same as
that of Wednesday. In the afternoon
a west wind commenced blowing over
the citv at the rate of tv/elve miles an
hour and before the sun had set old
Tamalpais was once again wearing its
customary cloak of fog. Professor Mc-
Adie of the Weather Bureau says he
feels sure that a cool spell is due and
that to-day will be much more, com
fortable. . . :
- The lowest point to which the mer
cury fell Wednesday night was 76 de
grees. At 9 o'clock yesterday morning

The humidity was lower even yester
day, than Wednesday, the official' record
being 15- per cent. People generally
seemed to feel warmer yesterday than
the day before, but such impressions
had no scientific basis, for the tempera
ture was actually two-tenths of a de
gree less on top of the Mills building
and the humidity was Ies3. The public ,
did not realize how hot it was Wednes- '
day and the ' weather experts j had few
inquiries to answer, but yesterday Mc-
Adie's telephone was ringing all day.

broken again and believed it had been. :
The mercury touched 9S \at Point
Reyes and 71 at the Farallones. Strong
breezes were reported from" all direc
tions last night. Eastern people were
surprised and it win require much to
convince them that spells of hot
weather are not frequent.
The Goulds are quietly preparing
formally to annex the Western Pa
cific Railway Company project to the
great system of railroads which they
control. Having selected. a route for
the new line across the Sierra and
entered the Eastern market for ma
terial for the construction of the
Western extension of their roads, they
have now injected into the directorate
of the Western Pacific Company one
of their ablest representatives, who
will" undoubtedly have much to say in
the future affairs of the new enter
prise.
At a meeting of the board of direc
tors of, the Western Pacific Company
held yesterday in this city Edward T..
Jeffery, president of the Denver and
Rio Grande Railway, was elected a
director of the new road, succeeding
William Gray, a clerk in the employ
of Attorney Bartnett, who had been
chosen a director at the time the
Western Pacific Company was incor
porated.-. .;'*'.Â¦;
A statement announcing the ..elec
tion of Jeffery was issued later in the
day by J. Dalzell Brown, treasurer of
the Western Pacific Company, who is
acting for Attorney Bartnett In the
latter's absence in the East. When
asked if, Jeffery had not been placed
on the board as the official represent
ative of the Goulds, Treasurer Brown
declined to make any further state
ment. It is generally understood,
however, that the construction of the
new road, which Is to begin soon, will
be carried on under the supervision of
the Yards. One of them, H. H. Yard,
has been prominently identified with
the local end of the railroad project,
while the other is Chief Engineer
Yard of the Denver and Rio Grande
Railway. The Yards will report di
rectly to Director Jeffery and he in
turn to the; Xew York office of the
Goulds.
Mirs Mitchell, is a handsome maiden
of 19 years and one of the most ac
complished belles of Xew York, having
been carefully educated abroad and in
this country. She was chosen to rep
resent Milwaukee by a committee ap
pointed by Mayor Rose. In conferring
this honor upon her the committee took
into cc-n5ideration the fact that the
Mitchell family is one of the oldest in
Milwaukee, the growth of which was
materially assisted by the efforts of her
father, the late United States Senator
John L. Mitchell, and her grandfather,
Alexander Mitchell, who was one of
Milwaukee's pioneers.
During their stay in this city the
members of the launching party will
have their headquarters at the St.
Francis hotel. They expect to remain
here until Monday, when Mrs. Mitchell
and her daughter will leave for the
north, to return home by way of the
Canadian Pacific road.

woman may be permanently
cured of monthly pains by tak-
ing Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound.
" Yocso Wouex : âr I had frequent
headaches of a severe nature, dark
r pots before my eyes, and at my men-
etrual j>criods I suffered untold agony.
A nxcaibcr of the lodjje advised me to
try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, but I only scorned
jrood advice and felt that my case was
hopeless, but che kept at me until I
bought a bottle and started taking
it. I 600a had the best reason in thp
world to chanjo my opinion of the
medicine, as each day my health im-
proved, and finally I was entirely with-
out pain at ny menstruation periods*
I am most grateful." â Nettie Black-
