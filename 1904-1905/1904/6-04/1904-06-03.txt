FATAL DUEL

Meanwhile the local police searched
long and far for the alleged incendiary
and murderous assailant. Yesterday
Constable Slanker found that the oil
saturated rags came from a room to
which only Willett had a key. Other
suspicious facts were revealed, but the
Claremont people denounced the con
stable's theory that' Willett was the
guilty person.
Constable Slanker and President
Gates of Pomona College went to the
bedside. of Willett to-day and showed
him proofs of his guilt. After two
hours of discussion Willett broke down
and sobbingly confessed that ' he had
planned and executed the attempted
burning: of Mrs. Renwick's house In
POMONA. June 2. â Harry S. Wil
iett, president of the Sophomore Club
at Pomona College and who came
from San Jose, has confessed that he
is the incendiary who operated at the
home of wealthy Mrs. Louise Renwick
at Claremont, in the Pomona Valley,
and that he shot himself purposely to
create sympathy for himself. The
confession has astounded people In
this locality and little else Is talked
of here to-night.
Early last Friday morning the peo
ple in Claremont, the site of the.Po
mona College, heard pistol shots in
the yard of Mrs. Renwick's mansion.
People who ran to the scene found
Harry Willett apparently unconscious
on the ground, with bullet wounds in
his left arm and shoulder. He said
later that he had been roused from
his sleep In an adjacent house by the
sound of steps upon the porch of the
Renwick residence. He said further
that he ran out to defend the prop
erty when an unknown man shot him
twice and that he fell to the ground.
It was discovered that some one bad
carried rags saturated with oil and a
bottle of kerosene to the porch and
had tried to force an entrance to the
unoccupied Renwick residence." All
Claremont was excited at the attempt
at incendiarism and praised Willett's
conduct. For a week he has been the
hero of the college town and profes
sors and students have vied with one
another to nurse him back to health.
CHICAGO, June 2.â One of the most
important moves ever made In this
part of the country toward the stamp-,
ing out of pulmonary consumption will
be instituted at once by the establish
ment of a tent colony at Ottawa, 111.,
under the patronage of the Illinois
State Medical Society.
The site, containing twenty-five or
thirty acres on a bluff overlooking the
Illinois River, has been donated to the
use of the colony and arrangements
are now in progress for the purchase
of tents and other equipments. Men
and women patients will be received.
It is the' purpose of the physicians
backing the undertaking to demon
strate that tuberculosis can be cured
in this climate, when not too far ad
vanced, by fresh air j and good food.
From this beginning it is expected sim
ilar camps will be established through
out the State. The only cost to the
patients will be the actual expense of
food. This item, it is estimated, will
be from $16 to $18 a month.
The consumptives who avail them
selves of the opportunity to regain
their health will be subject to one con
dition. They will be required to prom
ise when they enter the colony that
they will remain there until pronounced
cured. From nine months to a year
is the estimated length of residence re
quired. After leaving the colony the
patients will be observed for two years
and if no sign of disease reappears in
that time they will be considered per
fectly sound.
The tent colony will be open summer
and winter alike.

Reference to the dictionaries proves
conclusively that Tarpey looked after
his ammunition before going into the
fight. He didn't provide himself with
ten-inch projectiles for eight-Inch
guns.
"Webster defines "ambidextrous":
"Having the faculty of using; both
hands with equal . ease. Practicing or
siding with both parties. Esop con
demns â¢ â¢ â¢ all false shuflllnx;
and ambidextrous dealings."
The Century Dictionary la equally
explicit in defining what "ambidex
trous" means: "Having the faculty of
using both hands with equal ease and
dexterityj hence skillful, facile. Prac
ticing or siding with both parties;
double dealing and deceitful."
It is plain now, after the smoke of
battle has cleared away, that Tarpey
planned the onset to" crush and destroy
Budd. The wary ex-Governor must
have had some knowledge or'premoni
tion "of Tarpelan tactics. He did not
lose his presence of mind or yield one
Inch of ground, but returned the lire
with telling effect. The numerous non
combatants were dazed and bewildered.

The battle of the Santa Cruz conven

lasted fifteen minutes. The clash was
between M. F. Tarpey and ex-Governor
James H. Budd. both -of the Hearst
forces. The advance of Tarpey was
sudden and bold. He uttered no. battle
cry in particular, but swore by alhtbe
big and little buttes of great Shasta

iner stated this evening, after filling
their baskets they wandered through
the dense forest, admiring the beauti
ful trees, and when it was time to re
turn took the wrong trail and were
hopelessly lost in the famous chalk
ridge country, where every gulch and
hill looks alike. Bowes, who is. of a
very nervous temperament, became
greatly alarmed. Crawling Into a hol
low log they sought to sleep, but
Bowes, in his excited state, grew worse
and by morning was delirious. Their
continued absence caused alarm and
several searching parties were sent out
from the mill. One of the parties, un
der the command of Walter Bloom,
found them same twelve miles from
the mill, exhausted and worn out. They
were placed upon stretcners and car
ried to the mill, Where medical at
tention was given them, and in a few
daj^s they will be able to return to
Oakland.

RUSSIA'S KINCHOU LOSSES.
Thirty Officers and- Eight llundred
Men Killed or Wounded. '
ST. PETERSBURG, June 2.âA.semlÂ»
offlcial telegram from Mukden, dated
to-day, says the Russian, losses at the
battle of Kirichovrfon May 26 were
thirty officers and 800 men killed or
wounded. The guns abandoned by the
Russians were first rendered useless.
According *to Information in pos
session of the'general staeff, the enemy
has five divisions and five reserve
corps, about 80,000 men, on the Liao
tung peninsula,', and at least seven di
visions and seven reserve corps, or
about 125,000 men, in Southern Man
churia. Although the impressio^ pre
vailed among the members of the' gen
eral staff that 'General Kuroki's pur
pose was to make, feints to prevent
General Kuropatkin moving, but -not
to attack him until the result of the
campaign against Port Arthur was de
termined, there is now apparently more
Inclination to believe he will try a
demonstration In force, which might
result in a decisive, engagement. The
Japanese commander is constantly
shifting his columns back and forth
to conceal his real purposes, the latest
reports received being that he has
again abandoned Saimatzsa, north of
Fengwangcheng.
Â¦ All the reports received at General
Kuropatkin's headquarters from the
Kwantung peninsula are increasing the
extent of the Japanese losses at Kin
chou, one to-day making the number
at about 20,000 men.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 2.â It can
be predicted safely that, the , Russian
squadron at Port Arthur will riot wait
until the last moment before going out.
The Admiralty seems to entertain no
fear, if the situation there becomes
desperate, that the squadron will be
caught like a rat in a trap.
Rear Admiral Wittsoeft's dispatch,
given out yesterday, gave assurances

VLADIVOSTOK, June 2.â Letters

south of Anju. They have destroyed

fleeing to Manchuria to escape the
hardships of war. Chinese are moving
from Kwantung into Northern Man

LOXDOX, June Â¦ 3.â The Times'
steamer " Haimun returned to Chefu
yesterday from a cruise j in Kinchou
Bay. The correspondent aboard learn
ed from Port Arthur refugees tha*\ the
native and civilian population get only
such food as arrives on junks .from
Chinese ports . or what they . them
selves have secreted. The military su
thorities requisitioned all available
food. On half rations it Is estimated
that the garrison has enough for live
months. ._ ._ .....
The five damaged warships mooted
at the Port 'Arthur jetties, the corre-
Bpendent learns, have been denudpd of
everything movable. Gen
eral Stossel retains a large number of
junks in the roadstead. The objec; of
this measure can only be conjectured.
The correspondent says:
'"Eye-witnesses of the .battle of Kin
chou describe it as an unprecedented
military spectacle. Forty thousand
Japanese were massed behind the west
ern spur of Mount Samson, under
such small cover as was afforded by
the twin peaks. The trc-ops were with
in 2000 yards of the Russian worka.
There was so little room to deploy tor
attack /that battalions of Japanese
troops'* were obflged to stand in the
sea, waiting for the moment of at
tack, exposed to a veritable inferno
of fire from the Russian batteries. The
shells plowed into their masses.
"Meanwhile battery after battery of
Japanese guns went into action upon
the Chilishwaug and the Kauchiayan
flats and a sustained gunboat fire
played upon the Russian works. Their
lines were fringed with bursting pro
jectiles. About midday the energy of
the Russian defenders in the worka
in front of Mauchiaying village seemed
exhausted by the gunboat fire: Two
Japanese battalions appeared over the
saddle between the peaks and made a
desperate effort to carry the nearest
Russian works. At first the straggling
walls of Mauchiaying gave them some
cover and a moment's breathing space.
Then the gallant little infantrymen
crept again up the slopes toward the
Russian position. It was an impossible
task. As yet the defenders had not
been sufficiently shaken. An avalanche
of concentrated fire from infantry in
the trenches, machine-guns in the Rus
sian works and quick-firing field ar
tillery in the supporting defenses
struck the Japanese. They melted away
from the glacis like solder before the
flame of a blowpipe. A few, who
seemed to have charmed lives, strug
gled on until they reached the wire en
tanglements.
"It was in vain. Heroic effort was
wasted. Within fifteen minutes those
two battalions ceased to exist, except
as a .trail of mutilated bodies at the
foot/of the Russian glacis.
"Seeing the failure of this attack, the
gunboats and supporting artillery
concentrated the whole of their fire
upon the point where General Oku had
determined to drive home his wedge,
and by evening the works were prac
ticable for an assault by a general who
had such infantry as the Japanese and

oh this point. A portion, which was
made 'public, said that every ship ex
cept the Pobieda was now ready to go
to sea at a moment's notice and that
the channel was clear. He confirmed
the belief which existed here, that the
Japanese will continue their efforts to
block the channel before the decisive
moment to. storm the fortress on the
land side arrives, and has made plans
accordingly.
In the opinion of the most compe
tent military critics the land fortifica
tions must be breached t>ef ore a gen
eral assault can be risked and that is
not considered possible-in less than ten
weeks., . .
"Our putrols on May 31 had a skir

War of words. The air was full of

'You are not my friend. Jim. or you |
wouldn't talk so much behind my
back." said Tarpey.
'I have been more of a friend to you,
Mfke. than jou have been to me."
"I will bet you $100," said Mike.
â¢i will bet you a thousand," retorted
Jim.
"That is more money than you could
borrow," returned Mike.
"Not if I handled the Hearst sack,"
retorted Jim.

be averted by prompt intervention and
he 'promptly intervened at the very in- |
Etant that the right hand of Budd was i
reaching for the malt bottle. Wesley j
Heed joined O'Brien in measures to j
Mill the conflict.
Many allusions spiced the contro
versy that cannot be placed before the
reading public except in a style of cir
cumlocution . or expurgation.
For instance, Tsrpey observed that
he- had never seen the footprints of
IJOdd's friendship in the" Hearst cam
paign, and the ex-Governor replied i
that this defect in ground ward vision i
was. due chiefly, to the peculiar at
titude of- the Tarpey nose during a
period immediately preceding the Santa
Cruz convention: Arthur Fisk, the
Postmaster, inclined to the opinion
that Budd's allusion was not mail
*able. The hottest shot of the encoun
ter was one fired by Budd at the
Hearst sack. As one of. the- non
combat*ive push remarked: "That was
the blow that almost killed mother."
All afternoon- in .the couft of the
Palace and thereabouts the clash was
discussed. It was the general opinion
that another w.ord or two would have
precipitated a free-for-all fight of
large dimensions' The Budd adherents
â¢said: "A fight would have resulted In a. \
.tall for the Coroner, as the Governor '
had a revolver and a knife, in addi
tion to the ready, seize-me-quick malt
bottle."
"Budd would have gone to the "hospi- ,
tal if Tarpey's powerful right had been
ewung," replied thÂ« supporters of the
Hearst leader at Santa Cruz, "and
Tarpey was r.eady.to swing it."
TWO VIKWS OF THE SCRAP.
"Tarpey was the aggressor," said the
Budd sympathizers. "He opened the
attack, but he did not frighten Budd.
Did you ever see a man cooJer than
Budd. He never lost his temper, but
wasn't he sarcastic and nervy? Well,
you it.n(rvf he never runs away. He
stood his ground when Jimmy Mekiris
promised to come over from San. Ra
fael and kill him at high noon."
"Tarpey will not stand for all sort*
of misrepresentation," remarked the
adherents of Mike. "He was compelled
to bear the brunt o'f the battle at Santa
Cruz and his enemies are trying to

WILIi COST MAN'S LIFE
The $135,000 estate of Dyson D.
Wass, a contracting electrician, is the
subject of a contest in Judge Muras
ky's court. It is alleged by Mrs. Isa
bella Strachan. a woman who lived
with Wass for a number of years and
who says she was his common law
wife, that the property is hers. The
claim is opposed by a number of cous
ins of the deceased and by Attorney
Darwin de Golia, on behalf of Fred
Wass, an incompetent brother of the
deceased. Mrs. Strachan hopes to
prove that she had been acknowleged
by Wass as the wife prior to 1896, the
year in which was passed the law de
claring common law marriages null
and void.
She was a witness on her own be
half yesterday and testified that she
lived with Wass from 1893 to 1900,
and that during that time he in
troduced her to many people as his
wife. She said she had been a dress
maker at 471 Valencia street prior to
the time she moved to 307 Stelner
street with Wass. She also testified
that prior to Wass' death. May 14,
and as early as 1S93 she had in the
presence of Wass told many people
she was his wife. She admitted, how
ever, that she had never been known
to any of her relatives as Wass* wife
and that he had never Introduced her
to any of his relatives as his wife. .
A number of friends of Mrs. stra
chan testified that she had been

SEARCH FOR A WHARF
THAT ESCAPED IS FUTILE
All the evidence obtainable was sub
mitted at the Coroner's inquest held
yesterday, but neither the neighbors,
represented by Mr. and Mrs. Stoss, nor
the family, by Louis Caldarella and
Victor Orlando, a brother-in-law, could
give any facts explaining the deatfT of
the young woman. Detective Coleman
of the Police Department was on the
case, but his report was just as vague
as the other witnesses. The entire sub
ject was In such a condition that Cor
oner Leland decided to indefinitely
postpone the final hearing. As soon as
the Police Department has anything
in the way of testimony to show that
Maria secured poison on her own ac
count or that Michael gave it to her,
the case will be reopened and the mys
tery further investigated.
FACTS AT INQUEST.
When Dr. Johnson referred the mat
tor to the Coroner, Dr. Bacigalupi per
formed the autopsy. He found nothing
which would indicate poison, but as
the case had been so peculiar, he sent
the stomach of the deceased to Dr.
Bothe. the City Chemist, and that offi
cial found enough arsenic to destroy
the lives of many. Whether Maria re
alized that she was not the lawful wife
ef either Spiro or Michael and 'deliber
ately took poison the police are unable
to determine, but In the meantime they
are 4ooking for Michael and the man
who sold the deadly drug.
even attend the funeral of his supposed
wife. Arsenic . was found in her re
mains and now the police want -to know
more than they do as to Michael's sud
den leaving.

STOCKTON. June 2.â The conveying
of the non-union mill and warehouse
employes in carryalls to their suppers

was the occasion for a rather exciting'

the police were compelled to open
lane through the mass of people that
the carryalls might approach the
hotel. There was no demonstration
against the non-union men.

OMAHA, June 2.â A Newfoundland
dog taken tc Portland, Oregon, a year
ago has returned "to Omaha, having
tramped the 1800 miles in search of fa
miliar Bcenes and faces. The animal
belonged to Jerry Sullivan, formerly
sexton of Holy Sepulchre Cemetery
here. When Sullivan and his family
moved, to Oregon, the dog. which was
ten months old. was taken along. He
remained six months, but refused to
eat. lost all his playfulness and seemed
to suffer frcm homesickness. One day
he disappeared. Nothing more was
heard of him until a short time ago.
when he appeared in Omaha.
Gaunt and shaggy, with cockle burrs
matted in his tail, his feet badly blis
tered. It was evident that the dog had
covered at least a large part of the
long journey on foot. Some kind friend
had bound his two fore .feet with rags.
Over the rags was a piece of leather
cut from a boot top and each piece of
leather was worn through.
When he reached Omaha the animal
went straight to the house where his
master had lived. Finding strangers
there he whined dismally and soon
limped sadly away. He Is being cared
for by a neighbor, but refuses to be
fully comforted. The owner is in Port
land and has been communicated with.
SpÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK. June 2.â In an article
j under the caption "The Injustice of
i Vacations," the Independent quotes
i Russell Sage to the effect that he
! never has taken a vacation in his life;
: that the "vacation habit is the out
! growth of abnormal or distorted busi
i ness methods and that a man is less
' fitted to do good work for his employer
j after two weeks rest each year than
j he was before.
"When I was a boy." said the vet
j eran financier, "the practice was not
j in vogue. During the eighty-three
j years of my career I have not once
; taken a vacation. Aa a matter of fact
j I was so glad to get a chance to learn
! the business that the Idea of asking
j my employer to make me a present
I of two weeks of the time that belonged
to him would have been preposterous.
j Besides, I was eager to advance In
i business.
"Is it not absurd to suppose that
j a man can in two weeks recuperate
I from the wear and tear of a years
j work? On the contrary, I have too
often observed that men will, while
on their vacations, make inroads upon
their vitality and purses that cannot
be repaired in the following eleven
months and two weeks.
"A man should work 'easy,' be eco
nomical of his time, conserve his
forces and not worry. It's worry and
not work that makes the hair gray.
If I had a thousand tongues I'd preach
'save time* with them all. It's in
finitely more valuable than money."
NEW HAVEN. Conn.. June 2.â A loss
of 530,000 to $60,000. through embezzle
ment of its funds by a trusted em
ploye. Douglass IS. Smith, is admitted
by the officers of the National Trades
men's Bank of this city. The exact loss
Is cot yet known. Smith, who was pay
ing, and receiving teller of the bank,
hes acknowledged that he embezzled
Ebout JO.OQO, and the greater part of
it, if not all, within the past eight or
sire months.
A statement given out to-night by
Cashier H. "W. Simpson of the bank
says;
"The examination, by the national
examiner was held last December and
that by the comrnitte of the directors
shortly afterward, to neither exami
nation vraa any discrepancy in the ac
counts of "Mr. Smith discovered. When
it was decided to have another exami
nation on Tuesday last Smith did not
come to the bank. He sent a. message
saying that "he had been taking money i
from the bark and that he was not j
able to cover It .cp.
"As nearly as we can make out by
the examination thus far made we be
lieve.that he has taken about $30,000.
That is the sum which he himself esti
mates. . He was under bonds for $13,
000. given "by an indemnity company.
As Smith says he has not saved a pen
ny during his lifetime and cannot
make good the loss, we shall have to
stand the balance of the defalcation
above the $15,000 in bond.
"Mr. Smith says he has been specu
lating and that he took the money for
that purpose. The bank is safe and

depositors or our stockholderc."
Smith was arrested and held in $15,

it was stated" to-night after a later
investigation, into the bank's accounts
that Smith's shortage would reach al

Maria waited and Splro came back,
but one month ago he again departed.
Maria could not speak English, but
she saw how others of her class were
doing, and cast her blue eyes upon
Micael Angelo Caldarella. Michael
was smitten and at once took to him
self Maria. One happy month in the
home established at 203 Ritch street was
all there was in store for the two.
Maria was stflcken on the night of May
21. Dr. Johnson of 551 Third street was
MARIA WAITED.
Maria Caldarella, a pretty Italian
girl, is dead and buried, but her death
and burial are subjects for police inves
tigation. Maria died under peculiar
circumstances on May 21, and before
her body could be interred the formal
ity of the' certificate had to be attended
to. Signatures were necessary to the
application for the burial permit, but
before they were forthcoming there was
a quarrel between the supposed hus
band of the deceased and his father.
There was a dispute over her burial.
Later developments show that there
was arsenic in her stomach and that
she would have been a mother within a
few months. "Whether this fact was an
incentive to suicide or a cause for mur
der is what the police are trying to
learn. The case was heard by the Cor
oner yesterday and indefinitely post
poned.
Two years ago Maria was lured from
per home by Spiro Liotto, a young man
who she believed had great possessions
in the United States. Maria accompa
nied him to the city of Boston. For
many months she held the position to
which she considered herself entitled,
and even came to San Francisco with
the man she supposed was her hus
band. After coming to San Francisco
Liotto left his "wife" in the care of
friends while he proceeded to the Alas
kan fisheries to gather to himself more
"possessions."

it will be the greatest deal in an
nals of Canadian mining. '
The merger is being promoted in
London, England, where is located the
head office of the Le Roi. The other
mines are owned by Tpronto stockhold
ers. The Le Roi is famous because of
its sale for $5,000,000 by the Spokane
owners to j Whitaker Wright, who re
cently committed suicide. It was for a
false declaration concerning this mine
that he was condemned to imprison
ment. :
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 2.â A sen
sation was sprung on the mining com
munity of British Columbia to-day by
the announcement of negotiations for
the amalgamation of the Le Roi, Cen
ter Star and War Eagle mines of Ross
land. Their combined capitalisation is
more than $10,000,000.
The speeches were few and brief, but
overflowing with the most cordial sen
timents of good will, for both countries.
Bryce, after proposing the health of
King Edward and eulogizing what the
King had accomplished between ,the
European powers, proposed the health
of President Roosevelt 'as the greatest
man who had occupied the Presiden
tial chair since Washington.
Low dwelt upon the Importance of
the two countries knowing each other
better, the good results which followed
the Pilgrims in this direction and the
Importance of both countries cherish
ing and cementing the friendly rela
tions which now existed. *

i The hoist house was located directly
over the shaft, and when the fire oc
curred two miners were at work In the
mine and the exit was completely cut
off by the fire.. Help was summoned
from McCabe. and; Mayer and the. fire
was extinguished. One man, in his ef
fort to go down into. the shaft, fell 200
feet, and is supposed to be dead. As no
communication could be had with the
two miners they also are supposed to
be dead. â¢ N
At a late hour this evening rescuers
had been unable to descend into the
shaft on account of the deadly fumes,
but a hose has been sent down through
which air is being forced.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., June -2.â Fire oc
curred early this morning at the Hack
berry mine, Big Bug district, which de
stroyed the hoisting plant and resulted

and held them tight. The top of the
buggy being up, they could not fall
out. M*rs. Green received severe in
juries about the head while Mrs. Bar
ber's back was hurt. The children
were not scratched. The buggy was
smashed and the horse was cuti and
bruised.
REDDING. June 2.-rA buggy con
taining two women and three children
was backed over a grade at the Middle
Creek bridge near this city this morn
ing and crashed on the rocks in the
creek, twenty-five feet below. \The
buggy was wrecked and only the cour
age and presence of mind of Mrs. W.
F. Green, one of the occupants, saved
elderly Mrs. Barber and three children
from serious injury and possible death.
The women had started to Keswick
and took the three children with them.
Just before they reached the wagon

afternoon and to-night the police have
been searching the country for M. V.
Clark, an employe in one of the local
abstract offices, who has disappeared
after leaving a note to his wife Inti

Clark, who is 60, years of age, came
to this citv with his family some
twelve years ago, and was well thought
of. Recently he lost some money, and
brooded over it until his friends began
to suspect that he was becoming de
mented. Thl? morning shortly after
he left the house his wife found, post
ed in a conspicuous place, a note say
ing:
"Good-by; I will think of you with
my dyjrig breath." 'Â¦ "
Below was a rudely drawn figure of
a skull and cross bones. Instead of
notifying police headquarters imme
diately, the bewildered family under
took 1 a private search for the missing
man, and only appealed to the offi
cers late in the afternoon.

JO AITS KIDNEY ElixS.
A CITIZENS STORY.
Told by a San Prancisco Citizen for the
Benefit of San ' Fraucisco People.
The greatest importance attached to
the f ollowirg is that it concerns a â¢ San i
Francisco citizen. It would^los* thre-e-
quarters of its interest if it involved
some resident of Kalamazoo, Mich., or
WoonEocket, -R. I. Like all the testi-
mony which has appeared here, and like
all which will follow about the old Qua-
ker remedy, ' Doan's Kidney Pills, it
comes from residents, fellow citizens and
neighbors. No other remedy can show
such a record of borne cures. Read this
case:
Louis Sanquinctti. huckster, of 1819
Dupont street, says: "I was so crippled
with pain in my back. In fact. Lvras laJd
up with it. that I could not attend to my
work, when Doan's Kidney Pills came to
my notice and I took a course of the
treatment. Previous to that I had ex-
hausted my knowledge of known remedies
rathered from reading and prescribed
by my friends. Some recommended
this and some recommended that. I took
Down's Kidney Pills as I had taken other
preparations in the past, with very little
expectation of receiving any results, and
I must confess- 1 was more than sur-
prised when the aching in my back
stopped. That is six months ago
and it has not returned. I honestly rec-
ommend Doan's Kidney PiNs to others
bo that they may know about & prepara-
tion uport which they can depend." :

. Mayor Warren Olney hv*s decided to
Brpear before the UnltW States Cir
iu:i tlourt aSonftrf the ccwivisel fcjr the
Â« Uy'in vhe water rates litisa-tion. The
Mayor \Vill make a personal answer in
it he suit, and besides, he purposes to
actively 'assist in the defense of the
City Council. This decision was reached
to-day after his Honor had read the
bill of complaint that has been filed by
the Contra Custa Water Company.
The Mayor explained that he Re
lieved it to be his duty to assist in the
litigativn as he felt that he was famil
iar with many detail* of the water sit
uation in Oakland that would be of
value to the city in meeting the claims
ut the wat^r company. Mayor Olney
b!so said that the service he should
render in the case would involve no
t oet for fees upon the city, as he would
he acting .as the official representative
tf-thâ¬ city of Oakland, which, with the
City Council, is a named defendant.
After consultation with City Attorney
McElroy'a decision will be made as to
what the city shall do en Monday, the
time pet for the hearing in court on
the order to show cause why an in
junction should not be issued to pre
vent enforcement of the new rates. The
city -wilL ask for a continuance of the
hearing that sufficient , time may be
pranted in .which- to prepare the affl
Â¦ davits in response to the order to show
<" ause. The drafting of tnese affidavits
avlll necessarily- consume . some days.
\\ â¢'â* TWO CAUSES,
â¢ The action brought by the water
company involves two proceedings. The
*fir*t applies to the injunction applica-.
tiÂ«Ki*-and the -other goes to the main
cause â whether the jiew rates are un
just and mean a confiscation <rf the
Â¦water company's property.
Concerning tfifi case. Mayor Olney
eald to-day:
In view cf rrV position b.t Mayor I feel that
}Fhoul<i appear 'at Â«>oun**l. in the litigation.
Â»hairnl* an Â»*ffid.T.vit in my own bchair and
vhatl render all ' BÂ«=lstahc*> possible in tlie
cÂ»Â«e Hf-lir-p. Fatitined that the City Co-mcil
fcaÂ» acted fairly and justly. I'am ready to join
with the City Attorney In this suit.
His Honor also pointed out that
charges hah been made against him in.
the. complaint, touching his - attitude
toward the campaign for municipal
ownership of a water plant. These al
legations iwintouf that the market
%alu.e <if the Contra Costa Water Com
pany's stock fell from an average of
$75 a~ share during the three and a half
> ears "ended December, 1903, to $35 a
ebare during April, and May of ttiis
year. In its complaint the water com
pany, in this connection, recites:
â¢ That" dnrtnjt the year 1U03 certain politicians
commenced an aritation in raid rtty of Oakland
In favor ofmunlrioal ownership of water
wortfy, and industriously and vigorously niiJ=

during th" Cucal year, and to make the rztes
txÂ» ur.reaj'Gnanly low that the value of ccm
platnant't? iironÂ»Â»rt3r will thereby be greatly
iTisened. to the' end that the said city of

- ' VALUATION RAISED. .
- The' water company has raised Its
valuation $1,500,000 over the $7,000,000
allowed by Judge Hart in his decision
four ' years ago. It . now demands 7
per cent net on a gross - valuation of
$Â£,500,000. Including a'n allowance for
or prating â¢rf'xpenRes and taxes, a gross
income of $S. r .O',000 p.Ius $E2,000 for de
preciation-of, a grand total of $932,000 is
demanded. On the basis that seven
eighths' of this Income is to come from
the city -of Oakland the amount would
be reduced to $S15,SO0. ' The company
clalms that .under' the new rate of
grosÂ« income, , exclusive of taxes r and
opeimtlng- expenses, -will be only $401 -

drawing card enough, but he will be
assisted by several talented singers,
including Miss Carolyn Crew, Mrs.
Carrie Brown Dexter and Frederick
Veaco of San Francisco. Mrs. Dex
ter's artistic work is familiar to the
public, but Miss Crew is not so well
known. It is enough, however, to
say that she has an exquisite lyric
soprano, which recently created quite
a furor when she sang before the
critical Wednesday Morning Club.
Mr. Veaco is a tenQr â in fact, one of
the very few real tenors on the coast.

Oakland seems about to realize Its
ambition for a new hotel that will
combine not only commercial: but
tourist features. The project was
launched last week at the annual
banquet of the Oakland- Board of
Trade, and nearly $75,000 was then sub
scribed in less than ten minutes. A
committee oÂ£ citizens is in charge of
thework lzing a stock com.
and collectl 8ubscrIptlons. This
headed b c H KIn
ori&lnator of the plan> and , nci udes
we,,. k Oakland citizens:
wnHam G Palmanteer, manager of the
nes^ # ,,.Â¦-.Â¦',. jf-Vi
Cbloncl Irish had come prepared to,
disc Uss rather the advisability of bond
ing *he city for public improvements,
and >Sa5 heartily in favor of this*
"Anj-thtag thar .will tend to beautify
the c.ty and make it attractive for sei/
tiers 1 am in favor of, he said. Parks.
schoofeouies and good streets are
necessary to an up-to-date city.
JVRGUES FOR CITY'S OWNERSHIP
\ Troy in \answeringr ' this statement
mid that Ite'was not against public
improvements, but he- believed mu
nhtipal ownership of water works to be
of the first importance, and -was pre
partvl to speak on this part of the pub
lie improvement scheme. "Your other
schenv* can warL A new City Hall is
not Â¦ a necessity, but. by,common-con
sent ad adequate supply of water is a
public n>eed and Is. entitled to prece
deace overall other puWic improve

in Great Britain receive -water from
cities of moite than Â»0,000 population
onljtwo havÂ«t private water works."
" ' â¢
\V1IAT OTH1CR TOWNS UEARXKD.
The speaker quoted from reports on
municipal ownership in the United
States to show Â¦Â¦ that as an investment
it was a good thing. .
In reply Colonel Irish said^that most
of the reports quoted failed to prove
anything. In none of the cities in this
country could it be told what the water
really cost the cities, as deficits. were
charged to the general fund and the
ta-xpayers. ''If. however." you , want to
prove this, issue bonds to cover the
plant you are to establish'and let them
not be a lien on the property of the
city. I have' no objection to your try-
Ing this and seeing where you will
land."
, Central Bank; Isaac Requa, capitalist

| Frank C. Havens, manager of the
Realty Syndicate; William G. Hen
shaw, president of the Union Savings
; Bank; E. G. Lukens, president of the
Judson Powder Company, and George
C. Perkins, United States Senator.
This commtttee has already got down
. to work and. announces that it has in
: sight subscriptions amounting to about
5250/000, or one-half of what is required
: to build the hotel. It Is, proposed to
have the full' amount where it can be
used before work is begun..
BOWDOIN' OOLLiEGE PROPERTY.
The general features of the. enter
prise have already been determined.
The proposed site is the former Mer
ritt property, a square block of land
bounded by. Jackson, Madison, Twelfth
and Thirteenth streets. This is now
owned by the trustees of Bowdoin Col
lege, to which It was. left by Dr. Sam
â¢ uel Merritt. Bowdoin College is. far
away in Maine and has no use for non
productive property in Oakland. It
would rather have the money in hand,
and TV*. J. Laymance announced- to the
committee that he had secured an op
tion from the college upon the property
for $45,000, he to take his commission
out of that sum. The commission
amounts to $2000, and he offers the prop
erty to. the proposed. hotel company for
just exactly What the college has
agreed:- to take from him, $43,000. In
other vvrords, he. donates his commis
sion to the project.
j C. H. King last evening gave a din
ner to a number of prominent citizens
of Oakland, those present being- W. G.
Palmanteer, M. J. Laymance, W. B.
Dargie, H. C. Capwell, Charles J.
Heeseman, Bert Reynolds, Henry A.
Butters, Colonel J. C. McMullen, Dr.
H. G. Thomas, Charles E. Snook, J. C.
Klein, Frank C. Havens, A. H. Breed,
Erall Lehnhart and W. J. Laymance.
The hotel project was discussed from
different points of view, and it was the
unanimous opinion! of those present
that the movement should be started at
once. It was decided- that C. H. King
should be made the chairman of a com
mittee that would take the project in,
hand, Mr. King to. name his assistants
later. This was done this afternoon.
Within six months the Pacific Press,
the corporation that has proved a mine
-to the Seventh Day Adventist church
of this State, will be manufacturing
tits; wares: at Mountain View. A reso
lution) for this change was passedio
day at a business: meeting of the Cali
fornia Conference, of Seventh Day Ad
ventlsts. / ' Â¦.--'. r-V-.-t."'
A building will be erected upon a
grant'of land" that has been made by
the people ; of ; Mountain View. As soon
as that building Is> finished the Pacific
Press will be moved from Oakland,
where it has been for twenty- five
years. It 1s proposed to dispose of
the old building at Twelfth and Castro
streets and also- th& church at Twelfth
and West streets.
The change is due to the sale of the
checkbook department of the Pacific
Press to a private corporation. The
church people in command of the pub
lishing company found that their con
tracts for checkbook tablets required
them to print many checks for saloons
and other questionable businesses' and
this was distasteful.
Acting on the recommendation of the
directors another resolution was passed
to-day calling for. the absorption by
the Paciflp Press of the California
Tract Society,, which has always been
a separate institution for the sale of
books manufactured by the Pacific
Press. By gelling its own wares direct
the Pacific Press people will save the
middleman's profit and thus make up
the deficit threatened by the loss of
the checkbook department. Hereafter,
only denominational work will- be. car
ried on by. the* Pacific Press. '. .
The report of the committee on cre
dentials, which was, adopted, recom
mended that 'the following named be
ordained' as ministers: J'. W. Bagby,
Andrew Brorsen, M. H. Brown, M. E.

B. H: Howe.
The Lodi German church,, which was
organized, on May 24, was- admitted, to
the conference- by unanimous vote. The
church has twelve members and; thirty
Sabbath children.
A large part of, this afternoon was
devoted to addresses by members, of
the conference on the subject of health.
The speakers were Dr. B. F. Richards,
Dr. T. J. Evans, Elder J. E. Burden,
E. J. Bowen, Mrs. Anna Morrison, J.

FIRST STEP WILL
BE FOR A DELAY
Far and near she looked, watched,
and waited. One day, she says, a
psychic in Rochester, N. Y., told her
that Cunningham was in San Fran
cisco. Believing the story with the
fervor of a- devotee, she began inves
tigations and- finally discovered that
her former husband, still unmarried,
was a detective with Morse's agency
in- San Francisco.
She tremblingly wrote him the story
of her love; her long search; her
dream of: a reunion. Fervently she
implored him to recall the affection of
the long ago and begin life In mature
y^ars where they, had begun it in the
sunny hours of youtti.
The letter . deeply impressed the
lonely Cunningham, who had suffered'
in silence for half a lifetime, for often
in memory he heard the voice and
saw the face that had charmed him in
the long ago.
He could not wait to answer her ap
peaFby mail, but hastily replied to her
questions by a. long telegram â and
every answer was yeatf* -So it was- not
long before plans were madej for a:
Western trip, and on the shores of
the Pacific the old lovers : met "and
were married here to-day, brought to
getheras If by a- magician's wand.
After eighteen years of separation
under strange - circumstances, Robert
S. Cunningham and Clara M." Cun
ningham, his child-wife of - eighteen
years ago, were reunitecf at the altar
here to-day.
They were children together "at
Portland, Or., and he was a man of 22
years, she a child: of 16" when the first
marriage made them one. The cere
mony was without her parents' con
sent and they had' the marriage an
nulled. Cunningham, was broken
hearted and his: girl-wife "was. miser
able. But in time, their families and
they drifted apart and years sepa
ratedithem; from their great sorrow.
Often, in happy; dreams 'the young:
woman" heard the footsteps of her hus
band's return, and to discover him and
take up again the broken threads of
affection became- the passion of her
life.

john McLaren, who was the
guest of honor at the
BANQUET.
High honor was paid John McLaren,
superintendent of the parks of San
Francisco, last evening in the mag
nificent banquet tendered him in the
American hall of the Palace Hotel.
Representatives of every class were in
attendance to show the gratitude they
feel for the man who has made Golden
Gate Park what It is. Good feeling and
friendship were the keynotes of the en
tertainment. Never has this beautiful
banquet hall presented a more exqui
site appearance. The tables were load
ed with a wealth of American Beauty
roses, whose perfume filled the air.
About the side walls and gracing the
tall Ionic columns was foliage from the
park, reaching almost to the ceiling
and ending in long sprays of purple fox
glove blossoms. The guest of the even
ing received his honors in modest fash
ion. Enthusiasm marked the entire
entertainment, and the spontaneity of
applause was something seldom seen
at a banquet board.
Andrea Sbarboro was chairman of
the evening. His introductory remarks
were in part as follows:
"Our guest is going to Europe and
this is a little send off. He will come
home in a few months and again re
turn to his labors. We have the pleas
ure of honoring this esteemed gentle
man, who has for the last twenty
years been working to improve our
great park and by his intelligence and
natural genius has transformed these
sand dunes Into the most magnificent
park in all the world."
Replying to Sbarboro's cordial words,
Mr. McLaren spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: First let
me thank you for this eplcndld reception. I
cannot for the life of me account for it. . I
have done nothing but my simple duty, and
that very imperfectly. It certainly will en
courage me to do In the future my very best
to serve you while 1 am retained in. the park.
Any one else with the encouragement I have
had would have done as well and perhaps
a great deal better with the encouragement I
have had from the grand men who have i so
faithfully -and Intelligently served you as
Park Commissioner!", men who have studied
and planned lor the Improvement of our parks
and squares and who have given you th,elr
best Judgment freely and unrelftshly, many
tmies to the neglect of their own valuable
Interests.
I eay that under such favorable circum
stances no one could fall to accomplish a
great deal. It Is to the Park Commissioners
much more than to me that you are Indebted
for what has been done for the Improvement
and embellishment of our great park. I have
been fortunate also In having associated with
me many active and Intelligent foremen, who
each In their several sections took great in
terest In the work.
Then again we have been very fortunate
In having In the Mayors' and Auditors' chairs
Gentlemen who took a warm Interest In park
affairs, in every instance recommending all
thi money that the laws and the charter al
lowed. The Supervisors each year gave us
encouragement and asslEtance by voting large
appropriations for park Improvement, and our
citizens generally, by their Interest and en
couragement, helped materially In the work.
So you see !t was practically Impossible for
any one to fall to do good work.
It certainly ' has been a very pleasant and
agreeable work I have been engaged In, study
ing and . planning the Improvement of our
parks and squares, and one of the principal
reasons for my going abroad this summer Is
to collect data and study systems of park
improvement, to that in the work of Improv
ing the new lands that are set aside as jiarkj
we may be more familiar with matters per
taining to parks and how to improve them. .
. â¢ NEW PARKS NEEDED.
, Speaking of an improved park system, I
hope that when the next bond Issue Is voted
on a larger amount than was allowed last
time will be Included, as our outer districts
are poorly ' supplied with open spaces. The
most pressing need, of course. Is In the older
districts of the city, where very few acres
have as yet been set aside. The district south
of Market street should have a large park of
at least 1&0 acres, east of Twenty-fourth
street; that between Twenty-rourth street and
the county line one of at least 500 acres and.
of course, the Twin Peaks. But when the
Twin Peaks question comes up again â¢ I hope

E. N. Willberg, a licensed surveyor,
who made a survey of the Lee property
on Sutter street, between Jones and
LeavÂ«nworth, resents some of the
comments made by City Architect
Shea on his report and has submitted
the following communication to The
Call:
Editor of The Call: Referring to your ac
count of City Architect Shea's report to the
Hoard of Public Works in the case of the
trespass of Mr. Lee's building on Sutter street,
between Jones and Leavenworth, in the col
umns of The Call of June 2. I wish to note
an exception to the wording of the architect's
report. Alluding to private surveyors and
tbelr cheaD work City Architect Shea should
tÂ« aware of the fact that the discovery of
the encroachment of thÂ« Lee bulldlns on
Sutter street was made by myself, a licensed
surveyor, when I surveyed the adjoining lot
for building purposes.
As the architect and surveyor of the Lee
building disputed the accuracy of my survey
I advl'ed the owner of the lot I surveyed to
also employ the City Surveyor to verify the
building line, and he did so. with the result
trit the City Surveyor's and my finding* were
almost Identical.
I have now only to add the Information for
the benefit of the public that licensed sur
\eyers a re not private surveyors, but public
lard surveyors, whose works are Just aa
official as city and county surveyors' work,
b-cpuse according to the statutes of Cali
fornia, every county surveyor must be a
licensed surveyor. ' and private lot surveying
was net contemplated by the new city charter
as a part of the City Surveyor's official duties.
And oÂ» to the cheapness of the work, of course
we cannot compete with the City Engineer's
department, as they have the city treasury
to draw on In case the schedule of charges
ft insufficient, which Is generally the case.
Very respectfully your.. WUXBERa>

Any man would surely be no man at all If
ho did not appreciate me honor paid him by
belns present at the gathering this evening.
A man who has been In the public service
seventeen years and afterward finds that the
citizens appreciate his work Is receiving, tha
greatest compliment that can be paid - him.
About thirty-five years ago some public
spirited cltirens proposed that the sand dunes
should be taken -by the city for the purpose
of making a public park. If you will look
through the files of the newspapers you will
see that these men were 'called . crazy and
some attributed' their action to political mo
tives, but I do not think that men then real
ised that within thirty-five years from that
time there would be a competent man su
perintending that park, one who to-day Is our
honored guest, John McLaren. There must
be some sterling work in evidence to enable
a man to weather seventeen years of political
storm, no matter what party was In power,
and In the seventeen years to be- always
deemed a man who could not be replaced; and
I want to say that In the labor party, which
In only two years old, the same feeling does
and I hope will prevail. I ask you to drink
a toast to John McLaren and hope that when
he reaches his native land he will find that
An outer system of driveways and boulevards
should also bo planned. Beginning also at
".'Â¦in Ness avenue and Market street, follow-
In? lhÂ» line of the inner circle and leaving
McDowell avenue at a point where' the line
oi Seventeenth avenue. If extended, would
crosn McDowell avenue, swing down the hill
to Baktrc Beach and around the cliffs to
Sutro Heights and the Cliff House, then along
t.he Great Hichway past Golden Gate Park
and alonz the Ocean boulevard to Lake Mer
ced, along' the southerly line of the lake to
the-* village of Colma, thence along the county
read around the point of San Bruno Mountain
to South San Francisco and return \by the
w;nd-protected bay shore road past Harry
Blankin's to Potrero avenue and Eleventh
street, where the drive would Join the ex
tended panhnndle, along which the drive would
reach the starting point at Van Ness and
Market, a drive of thirty miles.
Besides the main system many branch drives
wlli be laid out. For instance along the line
of lalals Creek from Army street to the vll
lutre of Ocean View, through the village to
Lake Merced, returning along the Ocean
boulevard, through the park and panhandle
to Van Ness avenue, to Potrero avenue, to
point of beginning. Â¦
The association that has taken up the work
o;: beautifying and adorning the city should
have all possible encouragement, and when
Mr. Buinham calls for our ideas and sug
gtMions I hope that all will present to him
their best and give him all the assistance they
can. to thÂ« end that when he has looked Into
our suggestions he will be assisted In his
work, and when you get his plans and sug-
Kettions you will have the very best that
skilled experience and good taste can possibly
sussest. Â£
Mayor, Schmitz spoke as follows:
will be Included, as It makes such a grand
background to Golden Gate Park. Next
should be included Lake Merced and its sur
roundings. These lakes are Indispensable, if
an extensive park system Is to be planned.
Sutro Heights, of course, must also bÂ» In
cluded In the scheme. The only way to pro
tect such old landmarks as Sutro Heights is
for the city to acquire title to them, and the
only way also to prevent .the overcrowding
of cities is for the people to reserve a large
percentage of the lands from being bullded on.
The park lands reserved â the next question
that presents itself should be the connecting
of these lands by boulevards and parkways.
I-ast year a parkway was secured connect
ing the Presidio with Golden Gate Park. In
the next bond issue the panhandle scheme
should be revived; but. Instead of stopping at
Van Nfh avenue. It should be carried clear
across the peninsula, opening up and giving
breathing space in that thickly populated dis
trict b twtÂ«?n Market street and the Potrero.
Another drive should be laid out connectlng
the park with the southerly Mission district,
by building up the rock canyon past the Alms
house property ajad down Seventh avenue to
the park.* As this drive would run across the
trade winds. It would be perfectly protected
and, with the parkway connecting the Presidio
with the park, will make a very good half
day's drive. Beginning at Market street and
Van Nfss avenue, driving north to Black Point,
past the newly, Improved Lobos Square by a
wide boulevard to the Presidio, around the
McDowell driven to Mountain Lake Park, over
the new parkway to Golden Gata Park, through
the park to the Seventh-avenue entrance, up
Seventh avenue past Lake Honda and the
Almshouse iir.d duwn Hock Canyon (before de
scribed) under the railroad to Bosworth street
and the Mission road, along the Mission road
to its Junction with Dolores street, along Do
lores street (whkh should* be run through to
the extended panhandle) and taking the pan
handle drive to point of beginning, would
make a delightful drive of flfften miles.
FOR MORli BOULEVARDS.
The Fire Committee postponed action
for one week on the proposed amended
ordinance to permit the erection of two
additional stories on semi-fireproof
building?, which are now limited to 100
feet in height.
The committee referred to the board
without recommendation the applica
tion of the National I^aundry Company
for a permit to conduct a laundry at
411 Sanchez street. Residents in the vi
cinity objected to the granting of the
permit in view of the proximity
of the Mission High School and the
proposed park to be purchased under
the bond Issue. The company produced
a petition signed by a number of prop
erty owners favoring the permit.
The method for the measurements of
the height of buildings under the or
dinance was referred to the City Arch
itect for revision.
The Joint Committee on Fire and Fin
ance yesterday recommended to the
Board of Supervisors the passage of the
amended ordinance reducing the height
limit of frame buildings from fifty feet
to forty-five feet. The reduction Is In
the line of better fire protection, espe
cially in the so-callcu lodging-house
district on Bush and Pine streets; and
was favored by the Fire Commission
ers, Board of Fire Wardens and insur
ance men generally, some of whom
were present at the meeting to urge
favorable action on the amendment.
It was stated that the only protest
ants against the change are the lum
ber dealers, and their objection is a
purely commercial, one, as the lessened
height of buildings will reduce the lum
ber bills materially. None of the lum
ber dealer*, however, appeared to voice
their protests, and the committee ruled
that the objection as stated is not a
valid one.
\\ hich Is deemed a necessity, and the
b'iard vill be unable to hire an at

provements if the special l^vy for
fu hools would be put into effect after
the charter Is amended in that re
gard.
The Health Board yesterday pre
â¢pared a statement showing: that the
appropriation made in the next mu
nicipal budget will result In a deficit
in all ' of the departments under its
control. The Supervisors have only al-
Icwed JW.600 for the central office and
the board asked for $TS,?10, which
n>ans a deficit of 517.610. Last year
$71,550 was allowed, making a differ
ence of -J10.3S0. ' The appropriation will
President Roncovierl stated yester
day that after mature consideration be
an;! his eolleaijys had arrived at the
conclusion that the special levy should
be outside of the dollar limit. He
points to the fact that the Board of
â¢Supervisors has already discussed the
advisability of submitting a charter
amendment providing for the levying
â¢ Â»f a special tax of 10 oents for public
â¢improvements ar.d that it would be
.wiypr to make the schools the bene
0ciuy of such a plan.
It is the consensus of opinion that
the p<N5ple would almost to a unit vote
for the charter amendment for a spe
cial tax for schools and it is doubtful
if the amendment for a special tax for
improvements would carry at the polls,
as every one realizes the importance of
properly maintaining the schools. It
is argued that the usual appropriation

Gavin McXab said in part:
1 will say "By their works ve shall know
them." We have bÂ«en showing every visitor
to San Francisco the works of this man, Mr.
McLaren, as our principal chieftain of mu
nicipal genius. There has been not a single
scandal In all tils years or administration.
Under his direction millions have b;?n ex
pended toward maktnjr the park beautiful,
and neither malice nor partisanship has sugr
gettcd the corrupt use of a single dollar. What
would San Francisco be If Â«rvery municipal
department was run on the game basts?

"The landmarks of speculative Masonry
positively excludes females from any

"King Edward has been taken to
task by the London Times editorially,"
says La Marquise de Fontenoy, "for
his altogether too conciliatory attitude
toward the Irish people, on the ground
that it is likely to imbue the Inhabi
tants of the Emerald Isle with alto
gether fallacious ideas and hopes con
cerning tl*e policy of his Government,
and reminding him that, no matter
what his personal sympathies may be,
he is bound by the restrictions incum
bent upon a constitutional ruler, and
that the policy which will be followed
is 'that of a constitutional ministry
supported by a parliamentary majo"bÂ»
ity.' Then the Times proceeds to des
cant . on the unwisdom of his saying
anything either to the Irish or about
then, since he cannot afterward 'de
scend into the arena of controversy to
protest against illegitimate" inferences
from his words to explain away ambi
guities and to correct misrepresenta
tions,' adding that under the circum
stances It is well to avoid giving the
Irish people 'a chance of plunging into
speculations so unfettered by rule.' Un
less I am 'much mistaken, this is the
first time since the early portion of
the reign of. Queen Victoria that the
London Times has ventured to thus
read a lecture to the sovereign. . In
those days the Times was continually
attacking the King's father, the late
Prince Consort, on account of his al
leged unconstitutional influence upon
the late Queen, to whom the abuse
caused much" pain and annoyance. But
since then the Times has always been
the first of the great organs of the
English press to champion the cause
of the sovereign against even any sus
picion of criticism. That the Times
should now have come out in this
fashion against the King is, to say
the least, remarkable."

BAKERSFIELD points with pride to the fact that
there are as many boys as girls in the grammar
grade of its public schools will, this year,
apply for admission to the High School. Heretofore in
.Bak'erafield, as in other cities, the girls entering the
High tchool have been much more numerous than the
boys.
. Why should there be fewer boys at any point who
appreciate the advantages of an education? Why should
the girls a.ee more clearly the good that resides in cul
ture? It is probable that, generally speaking, the boys
and girls have very little to do determining whether
they shall continue to attend school in the upper insti
tutions of learning after they have completed the gram
mar school course. The parents regulate that.
For this reason it is to be inferred that the fathers
and mothers of boys in Bakersfield, in this year of grace,
are wise in- their day and generation. Never have the
-benefits to be derived from judiciously directed study
been more evident.
Applied to the lowest and fundamental condition, it is
easily to be seen that assimilable information and, even
more than that, the habit of thinking in a definite direc
tion makes easier th r e earning of a livelihood. If the
boys leave school when they are very young the very
strong minded may succeed, but the majority are not
as well equipped to struggle with material conditions as
the girls are who remain at their books. In any city
the forward march of the girls into paying occupations
is noticeable. They win place by what they know and
what they can do. They are qualified to become con
fidential clerks, stenographers, teachers, searchers of
records, bookkeepers, and are found later in the per
formance of duties that not many years ago devolved
mainly upon men.
As" to the pleasures derivable from cultivation and asso
ciation with those of kindred mind there need be no
argument. Birds of a feather flock together, according
to an ancient proverb. Knowledge and general mental
refinement unlock so many doors to enjoyment, to
which they are the sesame, that whosoever learns will
strive to learn more. From any point of view, then, the
parents of/Bakers field, who are caring for the minds of
their boys as well as for their immediate /bodily needs,
are doing well. They are setting a good example for the
parents of boys everywhere.

IN THE PLAYBOOERS' CLUB.
"boo-ere" arrested at Sir Charles
"Wy'ndham's playhouse the other night
declared that although they disliked
Arthur Law's new play, "The Bride
end Bridegroom," most heartily, they
made a row because an actress who
had pleased immensely In. Wyndham's
previous production was not re-en
raged. The .fact that it Is "booed"
doesn't necessarily mean, either, that
a play is doomed. William Gillette had
a lot of this sort of thing to face on
the first .night of "Sherlock Holmes"
In London, but he played it at the
Lyceum for nearly twelve months.
Perhaps it should be observed that
some 'boo-ere" "boo" as a matter of
conscience. It Is a London first night
custom to "dead-head" all of the house
except the pit and gallery. The "ear
reft students of the drah-ma" seated
fn these r>artÂ» declare that the stalls
and dress circle are in duty bound
to applaud a piece whether It be good
or bad, so Jf the pit and galleries deem
a* play to. I e. the latter t: e *Wieve
in voicing their opinion as loudly as
f^csEibls in order that the dramatic
critics may not be able to write that
the rJiece was favorably received.
Ry the way, Wie writers on theatri
cal matters are. largely to blame for
the abuse, greater even than "booing,"
that has sprung up in London lately.
Tor- some time, mixed up with the
"boos," there have been expressions of
opinion shouted Jrora the gallery and
these sorne of the critics have been
foolish enough to quote. As a conse
quence there is reason for believing
that the kind of Jibes with which
Wyndham was literally deluged the
ether night are now delivered by their
authors for the simple purpose of "get
ting into the papers" â a tendency
which the following skit, published the
ether day, hits off rather amusingly: Â¦
'booed" off his own stage the other
evening, it Is being declared on every
land fhat sem>tk!ag must be done to
check this peculiarly Biitish means of
oipre^slr.s disapproval in a theater.
Probably nothing actually will be done.
The "pit-queue" has been threatened
many times with abolition, likewise
the custom of charging for pro
grammes â not to mention the censor
ship and the theater dinner that re
sults in fashionable folk arriving In
the middle of the first act; yet all
these drawbacks to play-going In Lon
don we still have with us. However,
it If rather" amusing to compare the
various opinions that, have been of
fered on this portentous subject since
the affair at Wyndham's. What is the
origin of the "boo" as an uncompli
mentary manifestation j no one seems
tc know, but it is a rare thing for
(he final curtain to fall on a London
production without some boos being
hoard. â¢ And when the pit and -gallery
are really on the war-path, the bovine
pounds /that come from them are ab
eulutely deafening. The "boo," how
ever, may mean anything. Some of the

"The agony I suffered when I real
ized my condition." says the victim of
this strange\ experience, "was beyond
all words to express. I was one of
two "personalities, but could not make
up my mind which one."
At this stage a most extraordinary
development took place. A third per
sonality, which Mr. Hanna believes to
have been his "soul," gradually estab
lished Itself. In this third state be
was conscious of the two others, and
for a lojig time the new "soul" strug
gled for mastery, finally absorbing the
other states of consciousness. Then
the mind and memory of Mr. Hanna
returned and his cure is now com
plete.
By progressively reducing the hours
of sleep, however, the specialist .at
length succede<Jjx narrowing the gulf
of transition separating the two phases
of consciousness until Mr. Hanna
would pass from one to the other
while awake.
Finally he led a boy life and an
adult life side by side, in the latter
showing himself an accomplished
scholar and-4n the former a child, but
in neither state did he remember his
parallel existence and if he- went to
sleep in one condition he invariably
woke up in the other.
At this stage Dr. Siddis. a noted spe
cialist, took charge of him and his
efforts to make Mr. Hanna remember
his former life were gradually attend
ed with success. First the patient be
gan to dream of his past and on awak
ing would mention names and places
without knowing their significance.
to stand he had to be taught to move
forward, which he attempted to do by
making high steps as if he did not
know where the floor was. Not for.
several weeks did he learn first to talk
and then to read and write.
The stage in olden times was more
closely allied to the church than now.
Thomas Betterton tottered off the Hay
market stage into a grave In Westmin
ster Abbey. He was old and crippled
with gout when he trembled through
his last triumph before a house packed
with great people, and in two weeks
the same great people were gathered
again in the abbey to see the actor go
dumbly through his last part. Here lies
Mrs. Bracegirdle, and here, too, Ann
Oldfleld, her rival for fame. Born in a
tavern, she went on the stage almost
before she was in her teens, and she
grew up a woman with a great gift and
no character. The ready dean of the
abbey found her a place when she died,
and Ann went to her grave as she
would have gone to a play.
One would not, sure, be frightful when or.e'Â«
dead.
And. Betty, give this check a little red.
Pope makes her say, and the actress
was laid in her coffin decked with Brus
sels lace and wearing new kid gloves.
The preacher in the abbey buried her,
he told the mourners, "very willingly
and with much satisfaction."â London
MaiL BCIHlPlfr - Â¦-..â_ <. _
In the same company lies Aphra
Behn, the barber's daughter, who was
the first woman >to live by her pen in
England. She was a notorious and
scandalous person, fit for the court of
Charles II, who used her as a spy, and
some of her plays were the worst ever
acted. She delighted in her wickedness
and rests with the saints.
More bitter was the Insult paid to the
dead when Thomas Thynn was laid in
the abbey in 1632. He was an infamous
man, murdered in' Pall Mall by the
creatures of a Swedish Count who
wanted to marry Thynn's wife, a girl
three times married at 17. The men
were hanged at the scene of their crime,
where Waterloo place now is, and the
assassination is pictured in bas-relief
in Westminster Abbey, where the vil 7
lainous Thynn lies with Chatham and
Dickens and Wilberforce.
There would be room for all our
great men in the abbey if great men
only had been buried there. The doors
in centuries past were thrown open
very wide. The Duke of Buckingham
buried a Scotsman there for no other
reason than that he was his friend,
and on. the funeral day a dog was
buried in.Tothill Fields in public ridi
cule. Thomas Parr, though he did not
write priems, was not a poet, could ad
vance, at any rate, one claim to lie in
Poets' Corner. Was he not the oldest
man alive? That is reason enough,
clearly, why he should lie where
Shakespeare does not lie, and it was
reason enough in his day, it would ap
pear, why he should lie among our
Kings. 'M-j : .
Parr, if the inscription in the abbey
speaks the truth, was 152, and lived
under ten rulersÂ»of England. He mar
ried again it is said at 122 and threshed
corn at 130. He began life as a farm
servant in Shropshire, and would have
died no doubt on his. Shropshire farm
if the Earl of Arundel had not un
earthed him. brought him up to town
by stages and presented him as a "piece
of antiquity" to the King. "What,"
asked Charles Stuart, "have you, who
have lived longer than other men, done
more than other men?" And Parr in
formed the King that he had done
penance in a white sheet when he was
100. Parr was exhibited as a curiosity
at a tavern in London until he died,
and in 1G35 the "old, old, very old man"
was buried in â Poets' Corner! He had
perhaps of.e other claim to the honor
than his years â he adopted the religion
of his ten Kings and Queens. He came
into this world raw, said he to Charles
Stuart, and he saw no good in being
broiled out of it.
John Broughton, if he had ever any
title to a place at Westminster, has
certainly not left it clear to his pos
terity. He was a waterman, who lived
through most of the eighteenth century
and revealed his bent for fighting and
knocking his brother down. He
knocked his brother down so well that
he left his "boat to become a "public
bruiser," and his booth in Tottenham
Court road was the resort of the elite
of the bruiser-loving fraternity. Tou
would have found even royalty there,
until one day when the Duke of Cum
berland backed him for Â£10,000 and
Broughton lost. The Duke never for
gave him, and though he had made
his -protege a Yeoman of the Guard,
he took away his patronage and left
Broughton to grow rich alone at his
theater off Oxford street. There he
fought ujftil he died and was carried
to his grave by five pugilists appointed
by himself. He has a niche in fame
asUhe father of prizefighting in Eng
land, and it is surely the strangest
claim that any man has ever had for
being honored in the most sacred spot
of English earth, among statesmen
and poets and kings.
It is a strange and startling com
pany that would fill the abbey if its
honored and dishonored dead could
wake up in the night. The son of

Property rights are Equitable rights, and a jury cannot
pass upon a question of equity. To make such a propo
sition and have it backed, as it was in 1896 and 1900, by
one of the great parties of the country, and to renew it
now, is evidence of the rapid growth of the anti-property
sentiment among the people caused by .the loose teach
ings of the Democratic party since it laid ._aside its
brains. The process has been a distinct advance into
socialism. The motto of that cult is "Property is rob
bery." If that premise is granted, property is not
titled to judicial protection, and allv property rights fall,
including the right of contract, which the courts hold to
be not .only a property right but the foundation of all
property.
A party that has this virus in its blood, as proved by
Mr. Hill's expropriation platform in New York and re
affirmed by this last utterance in Nebraska, is not a
party to be trusted with power in this country. Of
course all good citizens regret that this is so. Parties
are a necessity in republics, and their general purpose
should be so in line with the constitution as to make
personal and property rights safe, no matter which wins.
It is among the political vagaries of the day that Mr.
Bryan's platform. Which makes necessary the destruc
tion of the constitution, attacks President Roosevelt for
disregarding 1 "constitutional limitations." We have often
called for a bill of particulars to back up that charge.
It is one that the Democracy habitually makes. So fixed
is that habit that it denounced Mr. Cleveland, its own
President, for conspiring against the constitution and
striving to destroy that fundamental law. ' The charge
was as little true then as it is 'now. .But evidently that
is to be the campaign slogan of a party which proposes
to destroy every constitutional guarantee of the rights of
property.
Governments are instituted among men to secure the
inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness. For that the constitution was devised and for
that it is administered. All men have under it the liberty
to acquire and hold property and have it protected.
When that right fails and falls the constitution is a dead
letter. 1
THE Nebraska Democracy set the pace in 1896 and
1900 and proposes to keep it up. In its State Con
vention Mr. Bryan ruled supreme. He wrote the
platform. and took his place upon it, as the leader of the
delegation to the National Convention. This means
that there will be no complaint of a dull time in St.
Louis^when he gets there. He is better seasoned than
in 1896, when he caused such a stampede as was never
before seen in a deliberative body. He retains all of the
gushing and impulsive quality that won his first candi
dacy, made more persuasive by his experience in hand
ling men. With him and Hill, and perhaps Bourke Cock
ran and the" Southern contingent of spell-binders, at
work the National Convention will be as lively as a
swarm of grasshoppers.
In the Nebraska platform he rewrites his long digested
views. He demands the continued issue of paper cur
rency by the Government, and that the silver dollars
shall remain as a full legal tender lien upon the gold
held by the treasury. This monetary programme is lit
tle less offensive than his free silver issue, and in many
respects has equal capacity to disorder our national
finances. He demands a revenue tariff, and proposes a
constitutional amendment for an income tax. The socialr
istic features of the platform of 1900 are reaffirmed.
These include the New Zealand and Australian plan of
government ownership of public utilities and that sys
tem of forced arbitration of hours and wages which has
helped make the Australasian colonies the highest taxed
countries in the world.
The most radical plank is that which demands direct
legislation by the initiative and referendum of course.
The party has been going rapidly in that direction. It
means a complete revolution of our constitutional form
of government by eliminating its representative feature
and practically abolishing its legislative branch. In its
working this plan will finally abolish the judicial branch
also, and leave the executive standing as the sole rem
nant of the scheme of constitutional government so
wisely and carefully devised by the fathers.
This radical, scheme is urged by the cry that the peo
ple are to be trusted, and by frequent reference to Jef
ferson's views on that subject. There is no evidence
that Jefferson ever contemplated such a system as di
rect legislation. He gave many signs of being aware
that the direct rule of the majority, by the plan now
proposed, would terminate the rights of the minority,
and of course thereby end a republican form of govern
ment.
It has been wisely said that Mr. Bryan's plan of di
rect government, consisting of an executive only, charged
with the administration of laws made in the ballot box,
would be a failure, if every citizen were as wise as Sir
Isaac Newton. The plan pieces in harmoniously with
the denunciation in this platform of the\ use of the in
junction to protect property. It is the final dependence
of property rights, as the habeas corpus is the final pro
tection for the rights of person. Mr. Bryan demands
that such issues as are now taken into the courts on
application for an injunction to protect property shall
be decided by a jury. The motive for such a demand
lies in the desire to prevent courts from protecting
property in labor disputes. If, in such a dispute, the
partisans of one side desire to enter upon private prop
erty and confiscate it by forcibly denying its use by its
owner, Mr. Bryan would submit the issue to a jury, of
course composed of the partisans of one side of the con
troversy or of their sympathizers. â¢

of a Consul in relation to trade and whose reports will
be embodied in the trade journals published by the,as
sociation.
The Manufacturers' Association has this plaint to
make as the excuse for their organization of this irregu
lar consular service: "Canadian manufacturers have
found themselves much hampered," says the associa
tion, "by not being suitably represented in foreign cities
likely to prove. trade centers for the Dominion. The
United States consular service, extending of course to all
foreign countries, looks after such matters and thus the
American manufacturer has long enjoyed an advantage
which Canada and even England does not receive, for
the British consular representative is still a diplomat
and not "a business man such as the United States is ac
customed to send out."
The projected move on the part of the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association will be an innovation in the
trade relations existing between British colonies and the
mother country, for it will signify that, the colony feels
justified, by the implied inadequacy of the British con
sular service, in becoming independent of the mother
country in the matter of trade reports from foreign
centers. The power of the association that fosters the
project and the extent td~which the system of paid agent3
is to be incorporated will make practically a rival corps
of unofficial agents to the regular consular system of the
empire. How the champions of the pan-British Zollve
rein in England will view this indication of sturdy inde
pendence on the part of the Canadians is problematical.
It would certainly appear that the merchants of the Do
minion feel able to stand on their own feet, irrespective
of Chamberlain's schemes.
Our fellow business men on the north cannot be
blamed for "going it alone" if, as they claim, the British
consular service is not adequate to fill the needs of
Great Britain and Greater Britain also. The compli
ment the Canadians pay our consular corps may be de
served now, but will be far more appropriate when Con
gress shall have organized our service upon the broader
lines of the merit system lof selection and promotion.
Then our country will have the excellence of British
consular organization, with the added merit of the fine
business practicability that has drawn the envious com
ment of the Canadian merchants.

GRAND CIRCLE
HAS NEW CHIEFS
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., June 2. â
The Missouri Supreme Court to-day
decided that the State Board of Arbi
tration had no power to punish wit
nesses for contempt who refuse to tes
tify before It-
Lacks Power to Commit for Contempt.
"Go back to Jail ' till next Thurs
day," said his Honor, severely, "and
then I'll decida how^much longer you
are to stay there."
As she staggered away in the bailiff's
custody Mary expressed regret that she
had not forfeited her f 50 bail money.
"You've been drinking again," re
marked Judge Fritz as he glanced at
the flushed face and heavy eyes of
Mrs. Mary Galvin, the "Aristocratic
Soak," to whom on Tuesday he had
given two days' freedom In response
to her appeal for permission to see her
daughter graduated' from an out-of
town seminary.
" 'Deedno," expostulated Mary, val
iantly endeavoring to separate her
words and steady her wavering frame.
Thomas Moore was asleep in a
Chinatown gutter when Patrolman
Clancy scooped him in.
"I'll, hand It to you quite severely
to-morrow," said His Honor Mogan.
"I hope you'll get the limit for giving
the name of Erin's Immortal bard,
whether it's your correct one or not,"
growled Bailiff Hickey as he rudely
thrust Mr. Moore Into the "pen."
when his Honor pronounced Peter
guilty. . Then It developed that the
baseball belonged to neither of them,
but wa8 the property "of a third boy
who did not participate in the quarrel
at- all. Peter will be fined $5 to-day.

"George D. Collins, the attorney, yes
terday filed a complaint In the Su
perior Court against Adolph OttinÂ«;er,
the ticket broker, demanding Judg
ment for $2000 for professional ser
vices.
Collins Sues Qttinger.
The lawyers about town ask, "Why
this delay?" The charges against Col
lins have been made public. Their
transcription into legal form is not a
difficult task. Whenever the matter is
mentioned there is general interroga
tion. No one knows anything of these
charges apparently.
It is rumored that for some pause
or other the charges will not be filed.
None of the interested parties will
â¢vouchsafe any information. A Justice
of the Supreme Court said yesterday:
"I cannot see what has been done so
far except to give him (Collins) plenty
of free advertising." Collins stated
last night that if tlje accusation was
not presented within ten days he would
institute a libel suit.
Referring to the case last night At
torney Collins said: "I have been ac
cused by a committee and there the
case has ended. They have fired a
gun and hunted their holes. They
must file the threatened charges or I
shall sue them forlllbel."
Attorney George D. Collins has filed
in the Supreme Court his answer to
the expected accusation of the San
Francisco Bar Association. He says
he has done this to force his accusers
to file the threatened charges against
him and that he will sue them for libel
if they fail to do so. Collins' argument
is labeled, "In re Accusation Against
George D. Collins; Brief of Accused."
But where is the accusation? The
clerks of the Supreme Court have been
waiting until after the closing hour
for many days in order to be sure to
get the charges which are aimed to
disbar the attorney. The secretaries
have kept their rooms cleared of visi
tors in case the accusers wish to enter
their brief necretly. The Justices have
been perusing the answer to the
charges which have not been preferred.
The whole situation is anomalous.

IS OX THE AGGEESSIYE
Gladys SL Clair corroborated all that
Rose Decker told Judge Mogan anent
the disorderly conduct of "Kid" Nash,
who was jilted by Miss Decker and
uttered dire threats against her life.
Miss SL Clair was described by the
prosecuting policeman as the "star
roomer" of Miss Decker's select apart
ment-house in the 200 block of Mason
street, and she seemed to enjoy the
distinction thereby conveyed.
"I wasn't in me right mind vr*en I
did de t'lngB youse say I did," said
Mr. Nash to his accuser, "an' dis bull
knows dat I wuz bughouse w'en He
pinched mÂ«. Ain't dat right?"
'Miss Decker acknowledged that her
erstwhile consort's behavior was rather
irrational on the occasion referred to,
and the policeman testified to the same
effect.
"Tell youse wot I'll do> Judge," sugÂ«
Mrs. Maud Inman of 119 Turk street
and Mrs. E. Ramft of 906 Market
street tried' to "have it out" before
Judge Mogan, but were prevented by
the admonitory gavel of the ever
vigilant and peacfe-preserving Hickey.
Mrs. Ramft rented a suite of apart
ments toyMrs. Inman, who gave vapor
baths and advice to neurotics in quest
o/ treatment and able to pay for it.
When Landlord Walsh intimated that
he intended to increase Mrs. Ramft's
rental that lady besought Mrs. Inman
to exercise her well-tyiown power of
suasion to Induce him to forego his
intention. "If you talk him Into let
ting my rent alone," Mrs. Ramft is al
leged by MrsÂ» Inman to have said, "you
can have your rooms rent free for
three months." Mrs. Inman immediate
ly Interviewed Mr. Walsh, who yielded
to her request, and Mrs. Ramft fairly
fell upon her shoulder and deluged it
with tears of gratitude. A month
later, however, Mrs. Ramft demanded
her rent, as usual, and pooh-poohed
Mrs. Inman's reminder of promised
immunity. Mrs. Inman refused to pay,
and when she returned from a brief
outing she found her doors locked and
all her effects in the hands of Mrs.
Ramft. So she began proceedings for
their recovery, and thfas It happened
she and Mrs. Ramft, each backed by
an able and eloquent pleader, came
near "having it out" yesterday in the
presence of his Honor.
The women glared at each other In
anger and laughed at each other in
scorn, and each openly accused the
other's legal adviser of excessive real.
His Honor fortunately found a way
oat,, by suddenly discovering that no
return had been made by the officer
who served the search warrant upon
Mrs. Ramft, and when he told the par
ties to take their contention to a Jus
tice of the Peace there was suppressed
joy in his tones.
Joseph McEvoy, who was held in $500
bail to answer the charge of embez
zling $200 intrusted to him as collector
for Reinhold Richter Camp, Spanish-
American War Veterans, was surren
dered into custody by his bondsmen
and is now a prisoner. Thomas Crow
ley, one of the bondsmen, heard that
McEvoy was about to leave the city.
Mary Fleming told Judge Mogan that
she was taking a walk to ease a pain
in her back when a^ policeman arrested
her at 6:30 o'clock yesterday morning
on complaint of Joseph Smith of 603
Natoma street, who alleged that she
had an annoying habit of haunting bis
dwelling with larcenous intent.
Soon after one of Mrs. Fleming's ma
tutinal visits, Mr. Smith said, he missed
an alarm clock which he had wound up
and set the previous night, and he
strongly suspected that she had taken
it, this suspicion being strengthened J?y
the fact that as she was passing a
neighbor's residence the inmates there
of were startled to hear a prolonged
musical whlr-r-r-r emanating from be
neath her wrap, while her manner be
trayed great perturbation of* spirit.
Mrs. Fleming denied knowledge of the
clock and disclaimed intention of taking
property not her own when she dropped
in at cockcrow to see the Smiths. Her
visits, she asserted, were solely of a
sociable kind, so far as she was con
cerned, although fhey were not accept
ed in similar spirit, but rather as in
trusions, by the Smiths. She will be
sentenced to-day for vagrancy.
When the case of former Police Ser
geant Reuben A. Wolf, charged with
having brutally asaulted Edmond Cob
lentz,^ a newspaper reporter, was called
in the court of Judge Cabaniss the at
torneys agreed that they were not
ready for the hearing. So the Judge ar
raigned and instructed the defendant
and set the trial for next Wednesday.
"It was a few minutes past mid
night. " ; Special Officer Canham testi
fied, "and I was standing at Sutter and
I*avenworth streets when these two
messenger boys came running â "
"RUNNING!" exclaimed Judge Mo
gan.
"Nonsense!" muttered Bailiff Hickey.
"Don't forget you're on oath," whis
pered Clerk Grey, warningiy, to the
witness.
The attorneys' table growled incredu
lity, and the Inmates of the "pen"
perked up and took notice.'
"Yes, running," repeated the officer;
"they were running; and running fast,
too, as they passed me."
Then everybody stared at the two
diminutive defendants, who fairly
shrank into their natty uniforms as if
they were ashamed of the traditions
smashing conduct alleged against them.
Bailiff Hiokey immediately opined that
they were amateur Mercuries.
The policeman went on to say that
after the boys had passed him he was
informed by a citizen, name not given,
that they had just burglarized the fruit
store of Emil Savio, at 835 Sutter street,
and that it was his duty to follow and
arrest them. He adopted the sugges
tion, and when he took his prisoners
back to the fruit emporium he found
that the shutters had been broken.
"We didn't burgle nothin'," said
James Itodela, eldest of the defendants.
"We wuz jist a * playin' tlck-tack
tock," was the defensive explanation
volunteered by the other accused, Al
bert Flick.
As the owner of the damaged prop
erty was not present to tell whether
any of his wares had been purloined,
the case was continued till to-morrow,
with bail fixed at $250 apiece.
Peter Morrlsery and William Jagoe,
fourteen-year-olds, fought on Cheney
street for possession of a baseball and
Peter landed a right hook on Wil
liam's mouth which ended the "scrap"
and led to Peter's arrest for battery.
The lads renewed their oral discussion
in Judge Fritz's court and were rap
idly advancing toward the fistic stage
John Donahue confessed that twen
ty-two of his fifty-five years on earth
have been largely devoted to drunk
enness and consequent vagrancy.
"And you look it," said Judge Mo
gan. "For three months from this
dq^te, however, you will not have op
portunity to indulge your penchant."
Attorney Fennel, representing the
Citizens' Alliance, informed Judge Ca
baniss that the prosecuting witness
against Cliff Killner, charged with as
saulting a non-union stableman on
Hayes street, had suddenly and myste
riously disappeared, and that without
his testimony there was no probability
of convicting the defendant. The case
was accordingly dismissed.
Charles Hanson, accused of selling
lottery tickets, pleaded inability to de
cide whether it would be better for him
to acknowledge guilt or stand trial, and
Judge Mogan gave him until next
Tuesday to wrestle with the problem.
Dave Warfleld, similarly charged,
was remanded till June 9 by the same
Judge. The police say tliat Warfleld
sold lottery tickets to the Sheriff of an
interior county, who mailed them to the
authorities here.
Israel Berg smiled when Judge Fritz
sentenced him to six months' imprlBon
ment {or having failed to provide for
the woman and two minor children
whom he deserted in England and by
whom he was followed to this city,
where he had taken unto himself a
wife. Throughout his trial Berg acted
in a most heartless way toward the un
fortunate woman with whonY v he was
forced to confess he had maintained in
timate relationship for years, nor did
he show the least symptom of affection
for the little ones, who unmistakably
inherited his facial characteristics.
Shortly j after Berg's removal to the
prison hi3 accuser appeared as com
plainant against Albert Doran, John
McClean and William Burns, young
men recently from the East, who in
drunken frolic had smashed three doors
of the lodging-house kept by her at 17
Fourth street. They were booked for
burglary, but a charge of malicious
mischief was substituted, and of that
they were found guilty and will be sen
tenced to-day. The owner of the prefn
ises said they destroyed' about $1200
worth of his property.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Edward Crawford, accused of being
connected with the theft of rubber
boots and brass machine fittings from
the Charles Nelson Company, was dis
charged bjÂ» Judge Cabaniss. John
Brown and Â£>aniel Bigelow, boys who
are before the juvenile court on the
same charge, testified that Crawford
had nothing whatever to do with the
stealing. The plunder was Bold to va
rious second-hand dealers on Mission

Two pretty little girls appeared be

that since their father, James McFall,
sailed away to Hilo as master of the
bark Martha D&vis their mother has
been drinking and . neglectful of her
household duties. The case was referred
to Officer Young of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
Miss Decker expressed willingness to
make it a "go," and Miss St. Clair
also acquiesced, although she could not
forget that he (the defendant) had
treated Miss Rose "just awful." The
Judge interposed no objection, the po
liceman didn't seem to^care how the
case turned out, and Mr. Nash's pro
posal was accepted.

i The letters of Miss Merkley, whose pic-i
ture is printed above, and Miss Claussen,
prove beyond question that thousands - of
cases of inflammation of the ovaries and
womb are annually cured by the use of
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
"Dear Mrs. Pin-kham: â Gradual loss of strength and nerve force
told me something: was radically wrong with me. I had severe shooting
pains tbrought the pelvic organs, cramps and extreme irritation com-
pelled me to seek medical advice. The doctor said that I had ovarian
trouble and ulceration, and advised an operation. I strongly objected to
this and decided to try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetablo Compound.
I soon found that my judgment was correct, and that all the good
things said about this medicine were true, and day by day I felt less
pain and increased appetite. The ulceration soon healed, and the other
complications disappeared and in eleven weeks I was once more strong
; and vigorous and perfectly well. â¢
"My heartiest thanks are sent to you for the great good you have
[done me." â Sincerely yours, Miss Maeqabet Merkley, 275 Third St,
i llilwaukee, "Wis.

Captain Mooney's Denial.
Captain John Mooney of the City
Hall station denies most positively
that he has in any manner whatever
been connected with ex-Sergeant Reu
ben A. Wolf or his make-money-ea.Â»y
policy. He asserts that he was never
even approached by Wolf to Invest
any money in the scheme for the sim
ple reason that during the time "Wolf
was attached to Company B Captain
Mooney did not admire his metho-1*
of doing police duty and was more
than well pleased when the specula
ting sergeant was removed to another
district.

The Reno wheelmen will be rep

Angeles has also sent a strong team.
The complete entry follows:
From the enormous entry received
for the bicycle races at Ingleside track
on Sunday it is evident that that once
popular sport has obtained a new lease
of life. Three hundred riders wUl take
part in the different events. The five
mile handicap race attracted an entry
of seventy. There will also be motor
races and contests for automobiles.

MEN. OF WHOM MUCH IS EX
PECTED ON SUNDAY.
After the first two rounds Munroe
increased the length of the rounds to
six minutes. Indeed, he went four
teen minutes with the mitts and dur
ing that time took but two minutes'
rest. He appeared fresh at the end
of the boxing nnd was ready for more,
but his sparring partner -had enough.
A big crowd was on hand to see the
miner work out. and the doors of the
gymnasium had to be closed before
the fun commenced. Tim McGrath
has decided to charse an admission
fee of 23 cents hereafter. Just as he
did when Young Corbett was going
through his training stunts.
the Gymnasium.
It was a lively day at Jack Mun
roe's training quarters yesterday,
and from the time the big ButtÂ«
minfr arose in the morning till the
sun 'was about to set he was at his
work with a vengeance. He ran on
the road, pulled the various muscle
creating machines about and then
boxed six fast rounds with Andy Gal
lagher and Jack Sullivan.
He started in with Gallagher ami
went a fast one-minute round. Then
without taking a rest he called for
Sullivan. He began to get lively right
away, and ere the bout was more
than a few seconds gone caught Sul
livan a short jolt on the jaw that
put him to the floor and nearly
scared him to death. He eased up
with Sullivan after that, but kept
Gallagher stepping about pretty
lively.
Big Miner Boxes and Works Out In
BUSY DAY FOR JACK MUXROE.
The fifth was the time the game
was fixed properly. Tay Streib open
ed it with a bingle to left and Graham
beat out a bunt. Bobby Ganley laid
up against one of Ham's floaters and
sent It a-skipping out to the score
board. Bobby kept on going, and^ so
did the runners. They both arrived in
safety, and the fleet-footed little fielder
turned an ordinary double into a clean
triple by his great sprinting.
Julie Streib started the fourth run
on its course for Oakland in the sev
enth by slapping out a single to right
center. Red Devereaux followed with
a similar one, and Byrnes pushed a
wobbler over Steelman's noodle which
let Jule arrive with the last one of the
day. The score:

An error by Francis gave T. Streib
a start in the third, and the young
man was sacriliced to second and third
by Graham and Ganley. Then Mr.
Kruger came along with a large and
Juicy drive that lifted Mr. Sfeelman
several feet In the air and allowed Mr.
Streib to touch the plate. . Moskiman
eased a two-sackerout to right field,
but McCreedie nailed Kruger at the
pan by a brilliant throw. ,
Ham Iberg had a good collection of
the slow boys, but when the com
muters began to get right they could
hammer in runs without a great deal
of extra effort. All the hits were
bunched well on Ham, but Ganley's
triple in the fifth was the one / that
counted most.
Mr. O. Graham had about everything
yesterday a pitcher' needs to puzzle a
ball team, and it was not strange that
the Brownies should be chased away
from Recreation Park without having
accumulated any runs. They swung
and swung at Oscar's twisters, but it
brouarht them nothing, 'rtie five hits
were all scattered. Score:* Oakland 4.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
ST. LOUIS, June 2. â Jack McClel
land of Pittsburg was given the deci
sion over Abe Attell of San Francisco
to-night at the end of the fifteenth
round of the fight. Attell made a
claim' of foul after the thirteenth
round, but after a great deal of wrang
ling Referee Sharp declined to allow
it. McClellan had clearly the better
of the* tight from the first round. He
sent In stiff body and head punches
almost at will. Nour the end of the
thirteenth round McClelland landed Â«*
hard right to the stomach. Attell
curled up and went down, trying that
he had been hit below the belt.
He then went for a two-mile run
down the Middletown road, and on his
return a plunge and rub-down made
him look as fresh as a May poppy.
When the gong for luncheon sounded
Jeff was cne of the first ones away
from the work, easily distancing his
pretty and attentive wife.
At that Jeft dined sparingly, a bowl
of broth sufficient to feed an army of
unemployed and some Japanese rice
constituting the repast. After lolling
about until stage time he again strip
ped for action in the gymnasium- In
addition to skipping the rope, shadow
boxing and the like, Jeff wrestled with
the huge sand-bag, which weighs fully
200 pounds, for fifteen minutes.
More than likely this will be the last
time Jack Jeffries will train with his
famous brother. He has wearied of
stopping those so-called love taps,
which dent the frame and keep one
rocking like a hobby-horse, and will
probably devote his time to mining.
Jack Js interested in an Arizona pros
pect, and if the ore is all as good as
a piece he carries about In his pocket
Jack may in future become a multi
millionaire. He possesses a well
equipped library and will soon take a
course in chemistry- Apparently the
champion has not fully determined
what .vocation he will follow when the
ring and theatrical life cease to have
a charm. While Jeff admitted that he
would not be ashamed to again follow
his trade of boiler-making, he will haye
amassed a competence, ere many years
and the hammer and rivets will have
no fascination for him. !
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
HARBIN SPRINGS. June 2. â Sam
Berger, the big Olympic Club ama
teur, dropped into camp by this after
noon's stage, and, of course. It was at
once figured out that he had journey
ed hither to put on the gloves with
Champion Jeffries. Such is remotest
from the actual facts, however, for
while Sam may take a few pointers
for future reference, he came here for
a few days of rest and recreation.
The Olympian has soured on the box-
Ing game since his unsatisfactory bout
with Rodenbach and may not strive
again for honors in the ring.
"Jeff was feeling in fine fettle to
day, and If some burly chap anxious
to find out whether he could go some
had only happened along there would
have been some business transacted.
The big fellow Is rapidly rounding into
s'uperb. condition,, his wind being the
one defect. Short runs on the road
and plenty of boxing and wrestling
will quickly remedy this. Both fore
noon and afternoon saw the champion
at work in the gymnasium. In the
morning he skipped the rope, worked
the pulleys and wrist machine and
punched the bag. Four fast rounds of
sparring with his brother Jack fol
lowed. As Joe Kennedy is still un
able to put on the gloves owing to his
lame wrist,, the sturdy Sixth-street
fighter tugged and wrestled four
rounds with Jeffries. This is severe
work, and when through the champion
was perspiring as freely as though he
had been caught in a thunder shower
without an umbrella.

.VEW YORK. June 2.â By far the
most Interesting event run over the
muddy Gravesend course to-day was
ttiat afforded In the fifth race, when
two popular horses, Africander and
Hurst Park, raa like a double team
for a half mile. Africander was near
est the rail, presumably the deepest
part of the course, yet this did not
appear to impair his stride to any per
ceptible degree. Hurst Park, whose
sire, Kingston, was not a mud horse,
ran well and it was only in the last
furlong that the anxious backers of
Africander could safely venture to re
gard their wagers as won. Even then
Hurst Tark was not a badly beaten
horse.

Delmar Handicap to-day from Lemp's
big gelding, Elastic. The latter, un

race and it took Mordella's life to
keep her nose in front. Favorites had
another great day, the form players
handing it to the bookmakers heavily.
Seven books dropped out of the ring

CHICAGO. June 2. â Cloudy weather
kept the attendance down at Haw
thorne this afternoon. The track was
In good shape and the fields were large
in most of the races, there being few
scratches. Glassful gave the talent a
fearful thumping in the third race.
He opened at 2 to 1 and was backed
down to 9 to 5. He had all the best
of the start and then failed to flnlsh
in the money.
The . race furnished a grand finish.
Glassful went out to make the pace.
He could never get far away from his
field. Both By Ways and Walna
moinen were right after him. On the
turn for home Glassful chucked It up.
Wainnmoinen then passeM By "Ways
and led to the stretch. She was on
the rail and in the last fifty yards
Gregor K passed her. Moharib came
on the extreme outside with a mag
nificent rush, but could not quite get
up in time, Gregor K winning by a
nose. The price about the winner was
6% to 1 at poÂ»t time.
A good sized killing was made on
the victory of Tichenor's Admonition
in the second race. Opening at 2 to 1,
so much money was poured in on the
bookmakers that 13 to 10 was the best
at post time. Three favorites won.

HOSPITAL SHIP SOLACE
SAILS FOR .GUAM ISLAXD
Communicates With Honolulu by
Wireless Telegraph When Nearly
200 .Miles Out From Land.
HONOLULU, June 2. â The United
States hospital ship Solace, which left
here yesterday afternoon for Guam
Island, made wireless telegraph testa
and kept In communication with the
apparatus of the cruiser New York
for seventy miles. Later she main
tained communication with the Inter
island Wireless Telegraph Company
for 194 miles. At noon to-day, at a
distance of 250 miles, the test signal
letter "V" was five times repeated.
When leaving San Francisco the
Solace lost communication with tho
shore at seventy-eight miles.
After the entire morning session had
been spent in the wrangling of attor
neys on technical points of the law, six
jurors were finally secured yesterday
of the twelve who will try Jacob Ep
pinger, charged by the International
Banking Company with obtaining
money under false pretenses. The aged
defendant was in the courtroom during
the entire proceedings, but betrayed
no more interest in them than did the
ordinary onlookers. Only when it came
to the making of peremptory challenges
did hfe consult , with his attorneys or
offer any suggestions to them.
When court opened yesterday morn
ing the old dispute regarding the ac
ceptance of jurors who had been drawn
in 1903 was renewed. Attorneys Dunne,
Ach and ghortridge making lengthy ar
guments in support of their challenge
of the panel. They were answered by
Attorney J. C. Campbell and District
Attorney Byington. The chief conten
tion of the defense was that as new
names were drawn this year the hold
overs from last year / should be disquali
fied, even though they had only served
a month instead of a year, as the law
requires^
On the other side the contention was
made that. there had been no departure
from the statute; that the jurors were
all regularly dra,wn and were qualified
to serve.
HOLDS PANEL IS REGULAR.
After hearing the arguments Judge
TÂ«iwlor denied the motion to dismiss
the panel, to which ruling Attorney
Ach took exception. The court held
that the statute quoted by the defense
was not mandatory, but rather direc
tory, and that a broad and liberal con
struction "should be placed upon It. The
names in the jury box were not a false
quantity and the men were still quali
fied for jury duty.
The examination of jurors then con
tinued. H. M. Holbrook, the hardv/are
merchant, was first called, but was ex
cused, as he had discussed the case
with wheat brokers and did not feel
that he could give a fair and impartial
trial. Goldwin McAvoy, a Polk street
shoe merchant, had formed no opinion
regarding the case, had not discussed
it with anv one and had never even
heard of Detective Tom Gibson. He
was accented. William Piljer, who con
ducts a pleating establishment on Post
street, was next accepted. '\ f
Daniel McPhee, a contractor, an
swered all the questions propounded
satisfactorily, but as he admitted that
relatives of his had lost money by the
Eppinger failure he was peremptorily
challenged by the defense. John Man
ning, a retired police officer, was chal
lenged by the defense because his name
was on : :ii 1903 list. The challenge was
disallowed.
BUSINESS MEN* EXCUSED.
John F. Plum, a real estate agent in
the Mission, and John E. Sills, who has
a machine shop in Oakland, were suc
cessively examined and accepted. Solo
mon Schlossa, retired Bhoe merchant,
was challenged by the defense on the
ground that his name was on the 1903
list, and as the prosecution did not ob
ject he was excused. P. C. Rossi was
peremptorily challenged by the defense,
and Henry Schuck was excused by con
sent of both sides. Herman Hinkelman,
who is connected with a hay and grain
house, said it was impossible for him
to give a fair trial and he was dis
missed. John Greely, a contractor, re
siding in- the Richmond district, was
the sixth talesman accepted.
Court adjourned until 11 o'clock this
The Ujilted States cruiser Tacoma,
Captain F. R. Nicholson, from Hono
lulu, arrived here yesterday, having
spent four days. May 24 to 23, cruising
in search of doubtful Islands hereto
fore reported in the neighborhood of
â¢17 degrees north latitude and 136 de
grees west' longitude. The Tacoma
found no islands or shoal water and
saw no signs of land.
James D. Hague of New York, who,
by authority of the Secretary of the
Navy, accompanied the Tacoma for the
purpose of participating in the search,
says that this result is absolutely con
clusive so far as it concerns the ocean
area actually seen from the track line
of the Tacoma. The area thus exam
ined is about one-third of the ques
tionable region where islands have
been occasionally reported, and may,
possibly, yet ba found. The search of
the Tacoma was restricted to four days
by her limited v coal supply. As she
carried no appliances for deep sea
sounding, her exploration was wholly
superficial.
These results afford no hope for light
on the loss of the United States ship
Levant, which disappeared mysterious
ly in 1860, on her voyage from Hawaii
to Panama, and is now believed to
have been wrecked on rocks) some
where In her sailing track. This be
lief is founded upon almost unques
tionable evidence, indicating that some
of the wreckage of the Levant was
washed ashore on the south end of
Hawaii about nine months after her
departure from Hilo. Mr. Hague has
recently obtained some further data
concerning this wreckage and its sig
nificant relations to the question of
the Levant's fate. He is more than
ever confident that the vessel- did not
founder in mid ocean, but was wrecked
on some reef, perhaps, island, when
possibly there might have been, and,
in such event, still may be, survivors.
The search of the Tacoma was un
dertaken in hope of finding such an
island, if there be one. In this re
spect the result is disappointing. In
other respects the result of the cruise
Is beneficial, since It tends to the ul
timate removal from the charts of an
existing menace to navigation.
It is now for the Navy Department
to decide upon a further search. As
lias been stated, the short time of
search was due to lack of coal. It was
originally the department's intention
to fit out a vessel of large coal carry
ing capacity and equipped with proper
instruments for soundings, and this
The determined efforts of the police
to keep in custody William B. Ken
nedy, alias Richard Jackson, alias "Yel
low," who was one of the thugs arrest
ed for the murder of Policeman Eugene
C. Robinson, have aroused the anger
of Judge Cook.' Yesterday he cited
Frank H. Norman, clerk to the Chief
of Police, twice, and Detective .Ser
geants J. F. Dinan and E. J. Wren
once to show cause,, why they should
not be punished for contempt of court.
Kennedy was before the Judge for
the fourth time yesterday morning on
an application for a writ of habeas
corpus for his release. He had been
booked as a last resort "en route to
Grants Pass. Or., for burglary." He
was brought \ into court by Deputy
Sheriff Welch, and an oral return was
made by Clerk Norman that Kenpedy
was not in the custody of the police,
but of the Sheriff. The Judge insisted
upon, a written return being made, and
Norman, thinking the matter settled,
left tho courtroom. The Judge ordered
him arrested for contempt in open
court, and when Norman was brought
back he made a satisfactory explana
tion and was purged of the charge.
He later made the written return and
the Judge granted the writ and or
dered the prisoner discharged.
IS AGAIN' ARRESTED.
As Kennedy left the courtroom he
was arrested again by' Detectives
Dinan and Wren and taken to the
prison, where he was booked for an at
tempt to commit burglary at Cypress
Lawn Cemetery on the night of Janu
ary 20, 1902. Attorney Newburg at once
applied to the Judge for another writ,
which was made returnable forthwith,
and attachments were Issued against
Clerk Norman and Detectives Dinan
and Wren to bring them into court to
show cause why they should not be
punished for contempt by again arrest
ing Kennedy after the Judge had is
sued a warning that if any such arrest
were made somebody would have to
answer for It. They were brought into
court and released on their own recog
nizance till 2:30 p. m.
When the cases were called in the
afternoon Assistant District Attorney
Harris asked for a continuance of the
contempt proceedings till this morn
ing:, as he was not prepared with an
answer. V Â¦: Â¦ ''Â¦''!
NOT TO RK_TUIFLED AVITH.
The Judge said that if the police had
no legal cause to hold the prisoner it
should have been set forth in their re
turn. The prisoner had been arrested
on the threshold of the courtroom, and
the court was not to be trifled with. He
read a section of the code to the effect
that â¢Â». prisoner while going to, in at
teni. -;ice at or returning from court
could not be interfered with. He said
he had repeatedly held that a prisoner
must not be arrested within the court
house. A serious contempt had been
committed, and he wanted' to know who
had done it or advised It. He granted
the continuance till this morning. Tho
respondents were released on their own
recognizance.
After hearing testimony on the appli
cation for the writ th'e Judge said that
although the prisoner had been illegal
ly arrested, still he was in the custody
of the Sheriff. The point that the pris
oner had with the others conspired in
this city to commit a burglary, or at
tempt at burglary, in San Mateo Coun
ty could not be sustained. The offense,
if any, had been committed In San Ma
teo County, and he made an order re
manding the prisoner into the custody
of the Sheriff of this county for forty
eight hours, adding that if no demand
was made by the Sheriff of San Mateo
County for the prisoner within that
time the prisoner should be discharged.

NEW YORK, June 2. â Samuel
Filaraky, silent partner of the defunct
United States Fur Company of this
city, who. with Emanuel Slgrman.
president of the concern, la charged
with grand larceny, to-day made a
confession to Assistant District Attor
ney Garvln indicating that the com
pany was a clearing-house for fur
thieves throughout the country.
Filarsky said in his confession, ac
cording to Garvln, that SIgrman had
many professional theives in his em
ploy and that he even supplied them
with money and tools, and, as the
business increased, they organized the
United States Fur Company to better
dispose of the goods thus obtained.
The company was enabled to under
sell its competitors and many fur
dealers had been watching its opera
tions with suspicion for a long time.

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings ar& like
a living page of Flammarion'e treatise that Is
so electrifying the world to-day. He Is no
Imitator. His work Is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works In the open
He' Is an conspicuous for .bis wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he Is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness, f. -
A teat reading Is not a life reading Wben
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
Â»lve you a full life reading for $1. A test Is
of little value; when the mind Is troubled you
need more substantial aid and advice. This
Is just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives
you when you call on him for a , first-class
clairvoyant reading.
He aeks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find tho cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

to Mrs. Robert J. Burdette by the Cal

ter California oranges and nuts sent by
Commissioners Filcher and Wiggin3
were prbminent among the refresh
ments and helped advertise the State
among the rn^ny Eastern ladles who
were present to pay their respects to
the wife of the celebrated humorist.
Â¦Madge Morris Wagner, the poetess, is
here and will remain during the fair as
the guest of Mrs. Hart, hostess of the
Alaska building. Mrs. Haft has solved
in a heroic manner the problem of se
curing comfortable quarters during the
exposition." She has bought a house
near the fair grounds and will sell it
when tyie'fair is over. In this way she
is sure to escape a successive raise of
rents.

THE BURDETTE RECEPTION*.
The Missouri-California Club â ?Mis
souri first by right of precedence â is
the latest organization in prospect.
It will have unique quartern â a large,
concrete- walled room under the floor
of the Palace of Agriculture, just
where the spaces of the two buildings
meet. A trap door, and a stairway
will lead into cool depths. Ice water
will be kept there. All the exhibiti
tors in the building will be eligible to
membership and the initiation fee will
be $50. It will be the coolest club in
St. LiOuis in the summer time. The
floor is high' toward the front of the
building, which will permit of the
concrete room being constructed.
Among prominent Californians here
during the week were ex-Senator Guy
C. Earle of Oakland; Captain J. W.
Smith, grain merchant, of 'Stockton;
Dr. J. E. Cowles of Los Angeles; Mrs.
Sumner Hunt, a prominent clubwoman
of Los Angeles; Dr. Roscoe Thomas of

G. W. Baird, a real estate dealer of
Lob Angeles; Alpha Adams, a banker
of Oxnard; H. R.' Lipman, dried fruit
dealer of San Francisco, and Judge E.

NEW YORK, June 2. â A special
from Mineola, Long: Island, says: "A
woman about 40 years of age, t dressed
in black, with a black veil over her
face, entered the Surrogate's 'court
this afternoon and asked to see Surro
gate Robert Seabury. Chief Clerk
: Downing said the Surrogate was on
I the bench, and asked the nature of her
business. She replied that she wished
to see the Surrogate regarding her
claim against the estate of William C.
i Whitney, former Secretary of the
Â¦ Navy.
"I am Mr. Whitney's widow," she
declared, "arid I want to put in a
claim for a share of his estate, to
which I am entitled."
The woman declared she was mar
ried to Mr. Whitney on June 10, 1900,
at Plainfleld.

Union labor tactics of a sort that
certainly do not represent the better
principles of unionism and which must
be deprecated by all good American
citizens loving Justice and right, who
belong to labor organizations, are still
delaying the completion of the San
Francisco building. Sidney Newsom,
the architect, who has Just returned
to San Francisco, after watching the
progress of affairs for some time, said
before his departure that two men,
working conscientiously, could have
done in one day what tit ordinarily
took the seven staff workers employed
on the building a week to accomplish.
This, he declared, was no exaggeration
and the oace'at which the men were
going at the time bore out his re
marks. They are receiving eighty-five
cents an hour. It took two plumbers
two weeks toout in two bathtubs.
..The New'.York building is no nearer
done than San Francisco's. 'The fore
man : of ; the carpenters on this . struc
ture was accused, of ordering his men
to work slowly, so as to prolong the
There is but little California litera
ture at the California building, Los
Angeles and San Joaquin counties be
ing the only ones well represented in
that line. The book on California to be
published by the Commissioners with
money Â¦ provided for that purpose by
the appropriation act hawnot yet made
its appearance.
LABOR TROUBLES ANXOY.
The State dairy and honey exhibits
are not competed. The County Com
missioners have nothing to do with
these. There is also said to be a State
cereal display somewhere, but it has
not made its appearance in any space.
Bundles of the neat little pamphlets
advertising the Knights Templar
Conclave in San Francisco In Septem
ber have made their appearance on the
counter of the California building and
are being read with interest by all the
Eastern visitors who get hold of them.
The low railroad rates offered will
cause many to take a trip to California
who have, heretofore been unable to do
so. ; .
While Filcher is hurling himself into
the thick of the . fray Commissioner
Wiggins is sidestepping * everything
that looks like trouble and holding
forth to visitors in the California build-
Ing on the beauties of Los Angeles cli
mate in the summer time. Wiggins
has entire confidence in the ability of
Aubury and Filcher to put the remain-
Ing touches on the mineral exhibit. It
is now about ready and while It will
be surpassed by those of some other
States that made mining their central
feature it will be 'very handsome and
contain a variety of gold quartz and
other minerals that will hold the at
tention of practical mining men. The
stained oak cases that form the in
closure do not compare at all favora
bly, however, with the more elegant
ones used by Colorado in the next
space. The latter are made of a native
hardwood, polished till it glows red.
and the finest of French plateglass,
beveled, through the translucent sur
face, of which the gold-seamed quartz
shows in its complete richness.
The ends of the -plainer looking Cali
fornia cases are of common glass and
the plate on the sides does not seem of
the best. % The Colorado cases cost less
money than those used by California,
bids for their construction having been
invited.
EXHIBITS NOT COMPLETE.
WIGGINS LOVES PEACE.
When Aubury and Greenj read this
remark, the lapldolite tower and the
Imitation dome of the State capital
Â¦will vibrate from mere proximity to
them.
Matters may have been patched up
for the period of the fair, . but the
echoes of this embroilment will be
heard in California while the Palace
erf Mines and Metallurgy Is furnishing
kindling for the housewives of St.
Louis. Filcher's letter is destined to
become historic. Aubury is not the
only one who Is hopping around hold
ing his corns. Colonel Green at Sacra
mento is twice as mad as the most
irascible hornet that ever had his an
cestral castle attacked. He acknowl
edges that Sacramento .was behind, but
then he was sick In bed for three weeks
after he reached here, there was
trouble about adjusting space among
the counties in his association and the
plans of the Sacramento central struc
ture had to be changed.
FJlcher seems actually surprised that
he has created such a commotion.
"Why," he said, "when I heard of the
row Aubury and Green were making
over my letter to the home paper I
looked it up again to see if I really
had written anything. I was surprised
when I read it in print to find I had
been so mild."
CALL BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR,
ST. LOUIS, June 2.â Following his lit
erary night in the columns of the Au
burn Herald, in which he toasted the
State Mineralogist and some of the
County Commissioners for alleged
backwardness in installing exhibits.
Commissioner Filcher has peeled off
his coat and himself sailed into the
thick of the dust and noise surround-,
ing the softly shaded lapidolite column
that marks the center at California's
mining display.
Lewis E. . Aubury, State Mineralo
gist, who felt that he had received
the most severe wounds from the bolt
of criticism turned loose by the State
Commissioner and whose wrath at
what he â¢ termed an uncalled for at
tack brought about a sulphurous ver
bal encounter between the two, is car
rying on business within the same in
closure. He keeps his coat'on. No rem
nants of a paleozoic age are hurtling
through the air and one would think
the entente cordiale had been estab
lished between the two.

'Apart firm a considerable decrease !n
loans Ian Â»Â«-k Â«nd a small increase in sur
plus reserve. ;her* have been no developments
of a nature rnUlr hÂ»!rful to the stock mÂ»r
fcft. ThÂ« most eat'.Etactory element in t*iat
r*rt!etilar fesiui-e Â»as thtt it reflected the
closing up of certain -yndtrate operations
which had ueccesarily tied up considerable
capita! for t lonx i-erlofl. One by one .these
â¢vrtficates are being wound up and more arÂ«
likely to follow- and tince the*e commitments
ha\e had much tÂ» do trith the expansion of
leans It would caupe no surprise if there
chou:d be further contraction in that respect
in the future. - -
"Another rircurartsnee which points to *
contraction ot Joans i* the diminished ac
tivity of remra! bu?ineÂ«s. It it idle to dis-
Sjuice thin fact. Dirtrlbutors report a lessoned
r.-ani in conrnminjr markets; manufacturers
are experiencing a falling off in orders; rall
rntids ar-r.ounc** frequent declines in earnings,
â¢ nd bank clearings rrove that the reaction
which began in the East Is extending to the
WeM aud South. New enterprises have re
ceix-ed a very decided check, as demonstrated
by the fact that new incorporations during
the fin?t four months of thiÂ« y<"Â»r wf-re scarce-,
ly one -third of those created in the same
I>erio<l of 1903 and 1902. The reasons for this
large shrinkage in new enterprise are: flrM.
the general recognition of business reaction;
frond that costs and wapes are often pro
hibitive; third, unsettled Tabor conditions, and
fourth, uncertainty about crops and the elec
tion.
AIJ'.KADY DISCOUNTED.
"There is no occasion, however, to be un
duly depressed by these developments. So far
as the ftock market is concerned, they have
been largely if not entirely, discounted, and
corrective influences are already at work which.
If allowed free r!a>\ will soon result In recu
peration and a fresh forward movement when
conditions become more settled and when prices
and v .-.Â£â¢ Â¦* reach a more normal level.
"'Much depends, of course, upon the crops.
fo far tn* outlook for corn. Â«Â»tion and epring
%-heat is favorable, although the season is gen
erally two week* late. Crop failure* this year
Â«ould be liisastrous; tut with a good average
harvest we are likely to witness reasonable
rc-covery n. xt autumn, preceded perhaps by a
further period of quiet and rest in business.
There Is no unsouridnes* in sight, and we are
?imply climbing down from the dizzy heigh'*
of the boom of 1902 to more natural and
more normal /conditions. Gold exports have
partially subsided for the present, owing to
better r*tes for money here and easier con
ditions abroad. . Tl.ere is also a good demand
for better class invtf tments. as vritnfssed by
the readiness with which the Cuban. Japanese
and other bond Issues havÂ« been taken up.
This is an excellent symptom, and would seem
to promise a better market for railroad shares
as soon as other conditions permit."

New York. Stock Market.
NEW YORK. June 2.â Conditions (\ specu
lation in the stock market were unchanged
to-day. The only conspicuous price move
ments were in the specialties, mostly of th*
obycurer class. Some of the high gra<le stocks
were affected. The general market was inert
and the day's small trading did not alter
materially the level of prices. The news of
the day was not Important. The report of
the April earnings of the Pennsylvania was
a depressing factor and had tome special
effect on that stock. Wall street regard* with
equanimity the declining tendency in the cot
ton market, as promising a better adjustment
to the needs of the cotton industry. But so
sudden a drop as that of to-day and the
presumed speculative losses involved by the
throwing over of long holdings hv the un
covering of f top-loss orders had sf somewhat
disturbing effect on speculative sentiment.
Tlie news of grain crop progress was not feo
favorable -to-day an<1 unofficial estimates of
its condition were given rome attention. The
figures of the national bank circulation for
M2y were discussed. As pointed out by the
circular Issued by the National City Bank
the adlitlonal circulation taken out for the
month of $11,500,000 wag greater with one
exception than any month In three ' years.
At the same time the current redemption of
notes through the redemption fund in the
treasury was $20,OOO,WO. but $1,082,000 meas,
ured the retirement of notes by deposits of
lawful money. The heavy current redemptions
are a t-ymptom of the tendency of the cur
rency to congest in the reserve centers, the
bank notes included In this movement finding
their way quickly Into the treanyry and so
back to their issue source. But the small
retirement of outstanding notes effected and
the large additional Circulation taken out is
the result of the profit on circulation by
reason of the fall In Government bonds on
account of the large amount released by the
Government in the withdrawal of deposits
with national bank*. It Is feared that some
redundancy is â¢ being injected into the . cir
culation by thef<? conditions, with the effect
of facilitating If not forcing th? outgo of
gold. The closing lone of the market was
rather irregular snd the day's changes were
again insignificant.
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, par ralue,
$1,225,000.

CHICAGO, June 2. â Higher cables, wet
weather In the Northwest and bullish crop
news caused a strong opening In wheat, July
balng up %Â©14c to ftig^c. at 87%c to 87%c.
Shorts were the best buyers, although there
WU a good demand from commission houses.
For ' a time the . initial strength
wa* well * maintained as a result
of the Missouri crop report, which showed
absolutely no improvement in the condition
of wheat. Advices from Kansas City stated
that heavy rains had fallen In Kansas and
Oklahoma, and wheat had been much damaged
by severe wind storms attending the down
pour. Strength in corn 'was also a supporting
Influence early in the session. - Later in ths
day trading became less active and sentiment
changed materially. *â¢ As a result of moderate
selling of September recessions wers made In
all deliveries, the market losing the greater
part of the early gain. A reaction in corn also
had a. depressing influence on the whÂ»at mar
ket. .The high-point In July was reached at
8T*4c After touching 87%c, July closed at
87ifc<gS7y 4 e. â¢â¢ .
Â¦ During the first part of the session senti
ment in corn was extremely bullish. Later in
the day much of the advance wu loat on
liberal realizing sales. The close, however,
was firm. July opened VJe to %c higher at
49 %q to 50 %c. sold between 49 %c and 60% c,
closing at 49 T ic.
In sympathy with other grains, oats were
firm. After opening a shade to %Â«fVtc higher,
at 3!t%a to 39%c, July sold between 3!Â»%-;;..j â¢..,..Â¦
and .â¢'.u'lftM'TiL- and closed at 39%c.
Provisions were weak on selling by pack
ers and small holders. Liberal receipts of
hogs and a big increase in the world's supply
of lard were thfe principal bear factors. July
pork closed at a loss of 17%@20c. at $11 87HM
11 40. July lard was off 7%c, at $6 40, and
ribs also were down 7%c, closing at $6 60.

PERSONAL.
The complaint alleged that the ranch
came into possession of John C. Gore
Sr. in 1863 and that in 1860 he gave a
power of attorney to. F. S. Seymour
in Boston to sell the ranch for $33,000,
or exchange it for property of that
value. It is averred that Seymour
deeded the ranch to Edward Tompklns
in the same year in exchange for some
Eastern realty, which Gore alleged
was of far less value and that he had
been tricked and defrauded by Sey
mour.- He asked for restitution of the
premises or their value.
Demurrers in the case of John C.
Gore Jr. and Hamilton Gay Howard
vs. the United States of America,
David Jacks and the Pacific Improve
ment Company were sustained yester
day by United States Circuit Judge
Morrow and the case was dismissed.
The suit was brought to recover pos
session of the Jacks ranch in Mon
terey County, consisting of about
5000 acres of valuable land.
Judge Morrow Rules That Gore
Waited Too Long Before Bring
ing His Complaint.

To Visit San Francisco
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
started for St. Louis last night on a
visit to the exposition. United States
Commissioner Heaccok will start to
day for the mountains for vacation.
He will return on July 6.
Judge Morrow Departs.
Since that date It has been /discov
ered that after leaving the company
Gildersleeve collected premiums on
three or four policies, discounting them
and Issuing personal receipts, which
were as worthless as the paper they
were written upon. From Philip B.
Anspacher, an attorney, he collected
a premium of $50,- not due to be paid
until September 1. giving a receipt
signed by himself personally and not
as agent of the Aetna. Of course the
Aetna could not honor the paper. He
made similar collections from Theodore
Watson of 72S Cole street and from
Robert W. Ritchie, a member of his
own fraternity.
A day or two before his connection
with the ' company ! was severed it Is
said that Glldersleeve was in need of
funds. It Is alleged that he obtained
blank telegraph receipts from the oper
ator at the Palace and later presented
a message to B. H. Lestock Gregory,
local â¢ manager for the /Aetna, Â¦ which
stated that Glldersleeve's wife was
dying at Springfield, Mass., and sum
moning him to come at once. On the
strength of this he asked Mr. Gregory
to advance him $300 for commissions
on premiums due him. This was re
fused and on March 10 he presented
another telegram of urgent character
and was advanced $300 from the per
sonal account of Mr. Gregory- â¢
On Monday. March 14, he left." osten
sibly for Springfield, but it ia* not be
lieved that he went there. He was first
heard from from the Manhattan Hotel,
New York, and is now connected with
the Mutual Life Company at Its Fifth
avenue branch, Windsor Arcade.-
Mr. Gregory said yesterday .' that the
fraudulent collections recited \ above
were the only , ones Â» that j had been re
ported. The company was: in no way
responsible for Glldersleeve'a factions,
as his services had terminated. The
blame for the losses was with the pol
icy holders, who accepted Gildersleeve's
personal ! receipts without ' assurance
that he. was still the company's agent
and . without . even , having hlni'. Indorse
their payments 'on "the notes. given, for
their premiums. Mr.' Gregory., said that
Gildersleeve came to him .with the best
of credentials and was a good agent. .
It was reported that Mr. Anspacher,
RECEIPTS ARE WORTHLESS.
J. Burt Gildersleeve, society man,
college graduate and life Insurance
agent, left San Francisco on March
14 last and in the light or recent dis
closures he will have no desire to re
turn to the exclusive circles that ad
mitted him here. It is only because
of the softheartedness of friends whom
he betrayed that the young man will
be spared the humiliation of facing a
criminal charge in the courts. They
say that he has been punished enough
and his career as an Insurance agent
will shortly end because his "unpro
fessional" acts in San Francisco â¢ have
been reported in detail to every insur
ance company in America.
Gildersleeve had literary and athletic
tendencies and, besides being connect
ed with the editorship or the Chap
arral at Stanford, he was manager of
the university's football team two years
ago. He was a college man and had
married in the East before he came to
Stanford. After graduating from the
latter institution he entered the em
ploy of the Aetna Life Insurance Com
pany as a solicitor in this city. He
wrote policies for his friends, -class
mates and fraternity fellows' and they
say that he was a most persistent and
convincing solicitor. He continued as
agent for the Aetna ror about six
months, his services ending on March.
10 last.

A special dispatch to The Call from
Santa Rosa last evening said that
Judge Morrow's decision has caused
great rejoicing there among all classes.
The people are well satisfied with the
public water supply and believe that
their municipal prosperity would have
been retarded had the city lost the suit
and been mulcted in the damages
sought.
The city of Santa Rosa is furnish
ing water free to the inhabitants. The
expense of maintaining the supply is
being borne' by taxation.
Judge Morrow yesterday ordered
judgment to be entered in favor of
the city with costs.
The order was oral and no opinion
was handed down.
United States Circuit Judge Mor
row decided yesterday that the city of
Santa Rosa was not debarred from
competing with the Santa Rosa Water
Works in furnishing water to the in
habitants of that town. The water
company in a suit filed some months
ago sought to restrain the city from
supplying water to the citizens and
thereby ruining the business of the
company. It asked for a permanent
injunction against the municipality
and for $100,000 damages.

An interesting incident of the even
ing was the bestowal of the society's
decoration upon Judge William H.
Taft, Secretary of War, as a tribute to
his personal sacrifice in declining the
appoinement to a life, position in the
United States Supreme Court shortly
after his visit to the Vatican in Rome
in order that he might carry out a
promise made to the natives of the
Philippines to devote his attention to
elevating them to a plane of citizen
ship that would eventually demand for
them recognition from the United
States Government. The honor was
conferred by a unanimous vote of the
society, of which he was also made
an honorary member.

sulted in the selection* of the follow

Manly Spirit of His Act
STOET OF PHILIPPINES
COMPETITION IS LEGAL
At Palo Alto it was learned that
Glldersleeve's accounts as manager of
the football team showed no dis
crepancies, but his reputation in the
college town for paying bills was bad.
Unpaid debts aggregating $300 to $400
came to light yesterday.
When Gildersleeve came to San Fran
cisco he represented that he owned an
estate in the East, held in trust 'for
him. and it was known that his wife
possessed means. They lived for a time
at the Cumberland. Mrs. Gildersleeve
went East' to her .parents, and friends
say that they have separated.
While at Stanford, on his trips to this
city he- stopped at the Palace, and he
made that hotel his home after be
coming an insurance agent. It is report
ed that his room there was locked and
his effects held for payment of an over
due bill, but the Palace management de
clines to affirm or deny the story- While
there he did not display the attributes
of a "high liver," but those who know
of his personal habits declare that he
was something of a man about town
and was given to gambling, particu
larly on the races.
It is said that he borrowed $200 on a
worthless note from a Palo Alto friend.
one of the victims,: would prosecute Gll
derBleeve. Anspacher says this is un
true. "I % regret," said he, "that the
matter should be published. So far as
I am concerned I consider my differ
ence with Gildersleeve as settled, and
I bear, no grudge against him. I only
knew him as an insurance agent and
talked with him as a college man. I
found that he was a man with high lit
erary gifts and displayed great literary
tastes. He seemed to be more highly
developed from a literary standpoint
than the ordinary college graduate."
Another friend of. the man said that
he was -an anomaly in that he had as
sumed a very high moral position and
then descended to an. extremely low
level.
