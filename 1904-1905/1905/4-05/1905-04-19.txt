NEW YORK, April Important
experiments are now under way in the
Flower Hospital in this city that indi
cate the discovery of an alomst certain
cure for cancer. This is a new and
amazingly effective method in the ap
plication of radium-
Wonderful things were expected of
radium, and its discovery by Professor
Curie had barely been announced be
fore the foremost scientists of the
â¢world were striving to utilize this new
force In the destruction of disease
germs. Learned men of every land
were strong in the hope and confidence
that radium, when properly harnessed
to 'medical uses, would cure tubercu
losis, cancer and the whole grewsome
list of kindred maladies.
The results were disappointing. It
was found that only a small percent
age of radium rays could penetrate
thin glass tubes in which the new and
almost priceless element was placed.
Then the thinnest aluminum was tried,
but without appreciable improvement.
The radium experiments halted at
this stage. Then Hugo Lieber, a
noted chemist of this city, announced a
discovery that held aweSHK* uT prom
lac.
Lieber has succeeded in dissolving
radium, and the resulting solution ex
erts all the activities of pure radium.
Scientists at first could not credit
the claims of the inventor. Finally the
surgeons and physicians of the Flower
Hospital staff decided to give Lieber's
discovery a thorough trial.
There was an old woman among the
patients of the hospital ho was slowly
dying of cancer that had attacked the
Instep of her left foot. She is Mrs.
Â£arah Oliver of New Canaan. Conn.
Realizing the almost hopeless charac
ter of her malady, she eagerly con
tented to undergo experimental treat
ment.
Two weeks ago she recived her first
treament with the solution coating,
as it is technically known.
Six days later the great tumor that
menaced her life literally dropped off,
â¢bowing healthy flesh underneath.
Prominent scientists marvel at the
success of the experiment.

KILLS BEAR
AND BOBCAT
Auspicious Beginning
of Colorado
Hunt,
"Bully Sport" Declares the
Ardent Pursuer oi
Wild Game.
Newspaper Men Who Attempt to Fol

a Lesson.
*
GLENWOOD SPRINGS. Colo., April
President Roosevelt has killed a
bear and a bobcat. He is satisfied with
his hunt for the biggest game the Rock
ies afford. If he gets one more bear, or
several, he will be better pleased, but,
to quote his own words:
"I got what I was after. It was bully
sport and I hope it keeps up."
This is the story brought to Secre
tary Loeb to-night by Elmer Chapman,
a courier with a close mouth, who was
chosen to bear messages between the I
President and the temporary seat of
government at the Hotel Colorado in
this city.
While Chapman came through New
castle, where are camped numerous
correspondents of newspapers, he |
brought his story intact. There was no
leakage, and all the information ob
tained at that place was derived from
a view of a closely rolled fresh bear
skin, which Chapman transferred from
his saddle to the car at the railway
station.
"Is that all you've got?" he was
asked.
"Isn't that enough?" he replied.
This was about the substance of the
conversation in which Chapman par
ticipated at Newcastle. He was chosen
because he knows when not to talk.
Before starting on his hunt the Presi
dent said he did not want any news
paper men to follow him. To the three
correspondents representing press asso
ciations who accompanied him from
Washington the President said:
"You stick by Loeb and I will help
you all I can. 1 cannot send out a mes
senger every day, but as soon as there
is anything worth telling you shall
have it."
The courier got through Newcastle
without talking and the President
"made good" to those who complied
with his wishes.
But if the courier was reticent at
Newcastle, he was different when his
journey was at an end and Secretary
Loeb had removed the injunction of
secrecy. His eyes kindled with a fire
that told his admiration for the Presi
dent's prowess as a hunter more than
could the words at his command. One
expression which the hardy moun
taineer injected into his story was:
"Say, fellows, he's a 'beaut,' and no
mistake. The way he scents game
would make you think he was born in
the mountains and had never left them.
Say, now, being President don't make
any difference with a man that's got
the real stuff in him. Goff said he was
the real thing and did not need show
ing, but I didn't believe it."
According to Chapman, the Presi
ient is taking the true sportsman's de-
light in the rough life of the camp. He
is one of the first to be stirring in the
morning and always the first to sit
down to breakfast. The fare seems to
suit him, although he has said several
times he would be as well pleased if
It were less pretentious. His idea of
camp life is one kind of meat at each
meal, and that fried; vegetables of the
canned variety, coffee made over an
open fire and the smell of smoke in
everything that id cooked,
Things are different at Camp Roose
velt, as the boys have dubbed the out
fit on the Charley Penny Ranch. But
the President has been warned that
the chef may not be able to do such
good work after the camp is moved
and that the party may get enough
canned food to pleaee even the Presi
dent.
The big white horse which the Presi
dent rode out of Newcastle on Satur
day is his favorite of the three that
were taken along for his personal use.
It is not fast, but it is strong and the
trail is never so stormy but that the
President and his steed cover it if any
horse can get through.
Big â¢"Jake" Borah, known as the most
intrepid bear hunter in the Rockies and
the man who will take the most des
perate chanceft on a ride after the dogs,
admits that even the mountain guide
of many years* experience has some
things to learn about riding. He says
he can teach the President nothing.
A huge pair of leather breeches has
been added to the President's hunting
costume. When he left Newcastle on
Saturday he wore heavy canvas trou
sers without leggings. The flap was
taken out of the baggy trousers by
binding them about his ankles with
course twine. Now he has adopted the
leather breeches, as he has found that
they better turn the wind while on a
hard ride.
The early mornings and afternoons
after the sun has sunk behind the
mountains have been cold. Storms
have teen numerous in the vicinity of
the camp and farther up the moun
tains it has snowed heavily.
The thought of starting home appar
ently has not entered the President's
head. He said he intended to enjoy
himself as much as possible during his
outing and his companions believe he
is doing it. If he has had thoughts of
affairs in Washington he has not com
municated them to the mountaineers.
Business will wait until Secretary
Lueb's arrival at camp tomorrow.

Hopes to Obtain Information of Great
Value to the Human
Race.
Soeclal Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, April 18.â A com
mittee to operate with an international
commission appointed by the various
medical schools of Europe to report
upon chaiactertistics of the human
brain has been appointed by the Wis
tar Institute of Anatomy and Biology
here, and the mooted question as to
whether the weight of a man's brain
is a criterion of his intelligence and
genius is at last to be settled.
Thousands of brains of criminals and
I idiots have been examined in the great
prisons and asylums, and a very ex
tensive and valuable collection of sta
tistics made, but the brains of men at
the other end of the social ladder â the
brains of men morally, intellectually
and socially great â are almost un-
I known to anatomists. It is only on
rare occasions that they have had op
portunity of studying such brains.
There is a strong belief among anat
omists that, if it were possible to care
fully study and dissect a series of
these great brains, information of the
greatest value to the human race
would be obtained â information which
would finally set at rest the long dis
cussion regarding the relation of brain
weight and intelligence, and be of vast
importance to educators and criminol
oglsts.
One purpose of the Philadelphia
movement is to create a willingness
among prominent men â great artists,
authors, engineers, statesmen, gener
als, etc. â to bequeath their brains to
science for. weighing and examination.
There are three organizations now in
existenceâ the Mutual Autopsy Society
of Paris, the Cornell Brain Association
and the American Anthropometric So
ciety â the members of which pledge
their brains to science for examination
after death.

GOVERNOR GENERAL OF FRENCH COCHIN CHINA. TO WHOM THS PARIS
GOVERNMENT HAS SENT INSTRUCTIONS TO ENFORCE NEUTRAiJTY IN
THE COASTAL WATERS' UNDER HIS JURISDICTION.
QUESTION OF NEUTRALITY
DISTURBING THE NATIONS
French Government Protests That Its
Jfttitude Has Been Correct
LONDON. April ISâ Japanese diplo
mats and others in London regard the
alleged breaches of neutrality by
France In allowing the Russian Second
Pacific squadron to remain over time
on the coast of Cochin China as one
of the most serious developments in the
situation. Minister Hayashi and Baron
Sumatsu, former Japanese Minister of
the Interior, were both seen to-day, but
they were disinclined to give a hasty
expression of opinion or to anticipate
| official advices giving the facts as to
the period thÂ» Russian ships may stay
I in French waters.
Minister Hayashi was particularly
reticent, and said he preferred to await
confirmation of the reports which
have appeared to indicate a serious
breach of neutrality. Baron Sumatsu,
who took a view that was very far
from being alarmist, said that if the
reports were tjcue Japan would have
good cause to complain. Japan, how
ever, had no intention of seeking a
quarrel with France. He added:
"Japan is far from coveting Cochin
China, as has been imputed in some
quarters. I do not think that France
is encouraging the Russian squadron j
to misuse French friendship. On the
contrary, I believe that France is really
anxious to avoid trouble on account of
the Pacific squadron, in fact I think
responsible Frenchmen regard** the
squadron as an unwelcome guest, and,
therefore, I am fully convinced that
France will manage the matter in such
a way as to avoid being compro
mised."
PRESS SCORES FRANCE.
TOKIO, April' 18.â Discussing the
presence of vessels of the Russian sec
ond Pacific squadron at Kamranh Bay,
on the east coast of French Indo-Chlna,
the Jiji Shimpo declares that the use of
the island of Madagascar by the Rus
sian sauadron was a direct and pro
longed violation of the principle of neu
trality, but on account of the distance
Japan in that instance simply lodged a
protest. The paper, however, insists
that Russia is now using Kamranh Bay j
as a base for action against her op- j
ponent, and she intends to use it as the
point for effecting a juncture with the
remaining division of the squadron.
"If the use of Kamranh Bay is con
tinued." the Jiji Shimpo adds. "Japan
must regard its neutrality as complete
ly ignored and Japan will not be obliged
to respect its neutrality. Violations of
neutrality in distant ports are not im
portant, but when close to the zone of
war it is impossible to" view them with
the same leniency."'
The Jiji Shimpo further declares that
France is lending the Russians effi
cient assistance, thus actually joining
issue with Russia against Japan, and

paper adds, the spirit of neutrality ar
i fords no excuse for extending such
| hospitaiity to a belligerent squadron.
and it expresses the hope that Franc*
will take steps to abide by her obliga
tions and duties as a neutral power.
The Asahi Shimbun asserts that
France has deliberately keyt the pres
ence of the Russian squadron a secret.
The paper expresses regret at the fact
and hopes the Government of Japan
will act decisively.
EVERY PRECAUTION TAkc*.
PARIS. April 18.â The French Gov
ernment has taken every precaution
to secure the observance of neutrality
in French waters in Indo-China. To
this end instructions have been sent to
Governor General Beau of Indo-Chi
na again calling his attention to the
regulations toneerning the observ
ance of neutrality issued at the out
set of the war. These are identical
with the noutralitv rules in force dur
ing the Spanish-American war.
It rs believed Admiral de Jonquieres,
commander of the French naval
forces at Saigon, in proceeding to
Kemranh Bay. where part of the Rus
sian second Pacific squadron has been
seen, is. following the Governor Gen
eral's instructions. The latter were
not the result of the report that Japan
contemplated making representations
on the subject, as no such action has
thus far been ordered and France has
from the outset acted voluntarily la
seeking to maintain the neutrality of
her waters. This, however, is inci
dentally difficult at remote DOints not
connected by telegraph and far from
opportunities for official communica
tion. Nevertheless, the instructions
sent to Beau contemplate the full ob
servance of neutrality.
It is probable th;tt this has been
known to the Russian naval com
mander. Hdwever, it is impossible
for Fi-ance to anticipate or control
the movements of the Russian dquad
ron and she can only direct the Gov
ernor General to enforce the regular
rules concerning neutrality. The of
here have no information con
cerning the length or circumstances
of the stay of the Russian vessels at
Kamranh Bay and therefore they are
unable to determine whether the ships

Toro I*refrr> to Harass Russians With
Tor|>edo Attacks.
LONDON. April 1 8.â Baron Hay
the Japanese Minister to Great
Britain, expressed the opinion to-day
that Admiral Togo would not give
battle to Admiral liojestvensky with
hi? entire squadron, but would con
tinue the cautious tactics which char
acterised his attacks on the Port Ar
thur squadron, not because he feared
defeat, but owing to his desire to in
fli< t the greatest amount of damage
<Â»n the Russian? with the least loss
to himself. While confident of his
ability to accomplish the total de
struction of the Russian squadron in
battle, ther^ is danger of Togo losing
on*- or two of his big ships. Therefore.
Baron Hayashi believes, Tog:o will
employ his torpedo-boats and torpe
do-boat destroyers, which number
more than 100 and are vastly superior
to the Russian torpedo-boat flotilla, in
harassing the Russians, while grad
ually poking off the Russian war-

miral Togo to await Admiral Rojest
vensky off Nagasaki, Japan, where
Togo will have a base to repair his
damaged ships. This, Captain Yep
antchine admits, is important, owing
to the Japanese not having repair ves
sels.
The captain says further that
Togo's total strength represents seven
battleships against Rojestvensky's five.
The gun power of the squadrons, he
asserts, is practically the same. Togo's
heavy guns, dismounted for use at the
siege of Port Arthur, have been re
placed by new guns of English and
American make.
The captain declares that Rojest
y'e lengthy voyage constitutes an
achievement unparalleled in the past.

SUPERB SKILL
OF DETECTIVE
Kashovsky. the ** Russian
Lecoq,"' Runs Down a
Society of Terrorists
WOKEN WITH ASSASSINS
Famous Secret Service 3lan,
Eecalled From Exile, Soon
raptures Entire Band
ST. PETERSBURG, April 18.âGrad
ually many interesting details sur
rounding the recent arrest of a band of
about two dozen terrorists are leaking
out. The capture, which is regarded by
the authorities as being of immense im
portance, was accomplished by Kashov
sky, the "Russian Lecoq," who was dis
missed from the secret police several
years ago on account of his connection
with Philippe, the spiritualist, who cre
ated such a stir at court several years
ago and who, too, went to Paris to live.
Governor General Trepoff upon his
appointment as Governor General of
St. Petersburg induced Kashovsky to
return to St. Petersburg, and within
two weeks the detective captured the
entire band, which had been operating
here under the direction of the central
organization, which apparently has its
headquarter;-- in Switzerland.
Alfred Henry McCullough, the man
killed on March 11 by the accidental
explosion of a bomb at the Hotel Bris
tol, whose real name was Bauman, was
one of the chiefs of the terrorists, hav
ing charge of the manufacture of
bombs, and Kalieff, who killed Grand
Duke Sergius, also belonged to the
same group. After* Bauman's death
Kalieff's duties developed upon Leon
tieff, daughter of General Leontieff,
who recently was appointed Governor
of Yakutzk, Eastern Siberia. Mile.
LeontfefT became a convert to terrorism
during her stay at Lucerne, Switzer
land. Kalieff s identity was established
through the discovery of a photograph
belonging to Savinkoff. who has been
his comrade both at the university and
in exile. When Kalieff was charged
with his identity he admitted it, say
ing:
"Savinkoff has been arrested."
The police later thought they had
captured Savinkoff and so announced
publicly, but it turned out that the* man
held under that name wae another and
that Savinkoff. to whom Kalieff evi
dently had confided his intention of
killing Grand Duke Sergius, is still
safe abroad. â¢
Among the others captured was Mffle.
Ivanovitska, a sister-in-law </f Koro
lenko, the Russian author. She was
involved in the Nihilist plot to assas
sinate Emperor Alexander 11, for which
she was sentenced to fifteen years in
Siberia, but at the end of seven years
she escaped to America.
Perhaps the most romantic feature is
the fact that Mile Leontieff converted
two nieces of Governor General Tre
poff, and Princess Denisheff to the
doctrine of assassination and that after
the arrest of her mentor. Mile. Trepoff
actually attempted the life of her
uncle, firing two shots at him, both of
wbich missed.
Thereupon the two girls became
panic-stricken and attempted suicide,
Mile. Trepoff throwing- herself under
a train and Princess Denisheff shoot
ing herself. Neither of them succeeded
in killing herself. The family has since
tried to make it appear that the girls'
acts were the result of a mutual pact
for self-destruction, both being in love
with the same man, an officer of the
guards.
About 00 male and female students
of the Conservatory of Music who have
been connected with the agitation in
Ctvur of Rlmsky Korsakoff. who was
removed from his professorship in the
conservatory because ojf his attitude
toward the striking students, have been
arrested and sentenced to a month's
imprisonment.
DEATH FOR AN ASSASSIN.
Slayer of Grand Duke Sergius Found
Guilty and Sentenced.
MOSCOW, April 18. â Kaleieff, the
assassin of Grand Duke Sergius, was
to-day found guilty and sentenced to
death. The prisoner refused to plead,
declaring he was not in the position
of a criminal before Judges, but was
a prisoner taken in a civil war.
The only persons present through
out the trial were members of the en
tourage of the late Grand Duke Ser
gius and counsel, of whom two were
assigned to Kaleieff. The prisoner's
mother was not admitted, but re
mained in- the corridor.
Twelve witnesses were examined.
Prior to passing sentence the Presi
dent asked Kaleieff if he would re
peat the crime if he were given his
liberty. He replied:
'Without doubt I would repeat it
If ordered by the revolutionary com
mittee to which I am attached."
When sentence of death was passed
Kaleieff shouted:
"Execute your judgment as openly
as I have acted before the eyes of
all."
The date of execution has not been
specified.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 19. â The
burial of Lieutenant Leontiff, an of
ficer of the aristocratic Preobriensky
regiment and brother of Mile. Leon
tieff, who was arrested for connection
with a terrorist plot, was held yester
day.
Leontieff was asked by his brother
officers to resign after the arrest of
his sister, and thereupon committed
su'eide. Grand Duke M4chael Alexan

Many Workingirien Arrested.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 19.â
The police are making numerous ar
rests of workingmen and "intellec
tuals." and the prisons are now full
to overflowing. In former years those
arrested before Mayday were chiefly
"intellectuals." but this year the
workingmen are taking such a prom
inent part in agitation and disturb
ances that they form a majority of
those arrested.

HYDE ADMITS HE
GAVE DINNER WITH
EQUITABLE FUNDS
Called Sharply to Account
Lie Pas-d Between the Young Millionaire and
Al xander in Letters Made Public.
NEW YORK, April 18.â A letter was
given out to-night addressed to Presi
dent Alexander by James B. Hyde,
saying:
"1 see by the papers that you deny
the statement contained in my letter
to Mr. Frlck that you participated in
the syndicates therein mentioned. If
you made this denial, please inform me
whether you received from me the fol
lowing checks": Here follow details
of checks aggregating $61,447.
James W. Alexander gave out two
letters to-night, which he sent to
Henry C. Frick, chairman of the in
vestigating committee, and to James
H. Hyde, respectively. The letter to
Frick, relating to syndicate profits,
says:
"I deny that I have ever knowingly
participated in the profits of any syndi
cate for the purpose of underwriting
bonds or securities of which the society
became a purchaser. Mr. Hyde's state
ment to the contrary is incorrect."
Alexander submits a letter written
to him by Hyde on March 22. suggest
ing their reaching an agreement as to
the proper disposition to be made of
the syndicate transactions that have
been criticized. In this letter Hyde
states that he had drawn a check
for $63,233, his share of the syndicate
profits, and sent it to the society, to
be retained or returned as the board
should decide. Hyde's letter con
tinues:
THE DINNER TO CAMBON.
"There is also the matter of the
Cambon dinner, ttt% cost of which was
thought a proper charge to advertis
ing, following the common custom of
other companies concerning such en
tertainments. There is no legal lia
bility about it, but as the dinner was
given partly in my name I prefer per
sonally to pay its cost, which was $13,
089. I have therefore sent my check
for this amount."
Alexander states that under date of
March 24 he replied, saying:
"You are mistaken in saying that
the receipt by you of syndicate parti
cipations or profits was a mere con
tinuation of a custom which you found
in existence when you came into the
society.
"I do not know from your letter how
you make up the sum of $63,233 against
which, as you say you have made up
your mind there may be a reasonable
basis of claim that you should ac
count to the society. I am therefore
not prepared to acquiesce in the sug
gestion of your letter that it covers
everything in the category specified.
This is a matter which must be thor
oughly sifted. If you will have pre
pared a complete statement of the mat
ters which are the subject of your let
ter, together with the records of your
office in connection therewith, I will be
in a position to pass upon them. I
need not remind you that your office
is in possession of all data on these
subjects.
SCORED BY ALEXANDER,
"As to the Cambon dinner: I must
express my astonishment that it
should have been treated as an adver
tising scheme which you supposed
would benefit the Equitable Society.
Until I received your letter I always
understood and believed that the din
ner was given by yourself and Senator
Depew as a personal and social com
pliment to the French Embassador.
So the invitations read and I person
ally accepted and attended as your
guest on that supposition. How you
came to charge that dinner to the so
ciety without the knowledge of the
president is a subject upon which I
ask information. As the president of
the society, I also ask you to let me
knÂ«w what, if any. other personal
items you have paid for out of the
funds of the society."
Alexander's letter to Hyde, dated
April 18, follows:
"Replying to your letter of yester
day, permit me to say that you well
know the disposition I made of the
checks in question and you have no
occasion for addressing an inquiry to
me on the subject. I decline to be
drawn into a disingenious correspond
ence with you for the purpose of cov
ering your position and perverting the
facts."
HYDE AGAIN ROUTED.
Young Millionaire Hissed at Meeting
of Agents.
NEW YORK, April 11.â After a ses
sion at the Hotel Savoy lasting nearly
six hours, the 200 odd managing agents
of the Equitable Life Assurance So
ciety from all parts of the United
States adopted resolutions late this
afternoon asking the New York Legis
lature "to assert its plenary power by
enacting an amendment to the society's
charter," this amendment to give the
policy holders admission ta the direc
torate of the society. The resolutions
also provide that a committee consist
ing of one manager in every State in
the Union and one from Canada, to
gether with the manager in New York
city, should be named to visit Gover
nor Higgins and Superintendent of In
surance Hendrlcks and secure their
assistance in getting the Legislature to
act in the matter. This committee,
representing the whole country, will be
designated before the agents finally
adjourn.
To-day's sessions were replete with
developments. Several sets of resolu
tions were adopted. President Alexan
der made a brief speech. Vice Presi
dent Hyde followed him and in the
course of his remarks referred to the
sale by second Vice President Tartfell
of the latter's interest in the renewal
account to the company which brought
forth a sharp retort from Tarbell.
SHARP RETORT MADE.
"I may have sold my renewal inter
! ests," said Tarbell, "but I will never
' be called upon to put any money back
into the treasury of the society." This
declaration was greeted with cheers.
When Hyde arose to speak he was
hissed by a general agent of the so-
I ciety, who was said to be the leader in
i last night's movement to engage Jo
j seph H. Choate, now American Embas
sador to Great Britain, to conduct an
investigation on behalf of the agents
into the society's affairs. Hyde re
marked that any such reception really
was a compliment and proceeded with
j what he had to say, undisturbed by the
incident. He said if he had done any
thing wrong, financially or otherwise,
or had participated in any wrong-doing
by others, he should be "kicked out"
and if any other officers of the society
j had been guilty of wrong-doing they
should be thrown into the street.
As he was leaving Hyde said he
I would not return again to any confer
ence of the agents unless he was sent
for, in which event he would be very
I glad to respond.
At 5:50 o'clock this evening the agents
adjourned, to meet again to-morrow
morning.
The first set of resolutions declared
that the agents pledged their "unquali
fied support" to President Alexander
and expressed their "entire confidence
that the president will continue unfal
teringly and finish the work of mu
tualization that he has so courageously
begun." There was no reference in any
of the resolutions to Hyde.
Resolutions were adopted by the
agents giving their "unqualified ap
proval of the firm stand taken by Vice
President Tarbell in his support of the
president on the mutualization issue."
The resolutions declared that the funds
in the surplus reserve of the company
belong to the policy holders.
LEGISLATIVE DISCUSSION.
ALBANY, N. V., April 18.â An all-day
debate in the Senate chamber on a mo
tion to investigate charges asrainst the
Equitable Life Assurance Society and
the report of Superintendent Hend
ricks, who for the first time since the
Equitable investigation began talked
on that topic with anything approach
ing freedom.brought the affairs of that
corporation into sensational notice to
day. The subject came before\he Sen
ate in the form of a resolution intro
duced by Senator Brackett to take from
the insurance committee his bill to
facilitate policy holders' suits for ac
countings. Being unable to pet a favor-
b r e . re Pf rt on this measure. Senator
Brackets secured a chance to voice his
views by putting in this resolution and
having it made a special order of de-
Date for this morning. The resolution
W Â« s^ efeated by a vote of 36 to 7.

PREPARATIONS GO FORTH
FOR MAY DAY FESTIVAL
Mechanics' Pavilion Will Present a
Wonderful Spectacle to Vast
Audience.
The May day festival committee has
begun its preparations for the May
day fete to be held in Mechanics' Pa
vilion and has let contracts for the
reconstruction work, which will ac
commodate the 1200 singers who will
participate.
About 4000 chairs will be placed on
the lower floor, and the galleries will
be fitted for the accommodation of a
large number. Dressing-rooms for the
chorus, the band and the singers will
be constructed and a library for the
sixty trunks of music will be installed
with shelving and other conveniences.
Much aid has been rendered to Miss
Estelle Carpenter, the conductor, by
Alex Stewart, who has been drilling
the Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda
sections every week since early in
February. His work has been mval
uable and is highly appreciated. The
following announcement* with pro
gramme, has been issued:
The first reeervatlotod for the oetnlng May
festivals in Mechanics' Pavilion, April 30 to
May 7, will go on sale to-morrow mornln* at
Sherman, Clay & Co.'s. These reservations
will be for those holding: the advance saie
tickets and the coupon books, which have
been selling freely through the various schools
and music houses. These carry with them the
provision for a three days' advance selection
of reservations, and It Is the accommodation
of th-?pe that is sought at this particular time.
The regular public sale Is to open next Mon
day at the same place. Meanwhile, mail or
dert lor the regular sale will be received there,
or at 366 City Hall, and selections will be
made as nearly aa possible to the 'desired lo
catloufe.
Yet those who have not bought reserved
seats, exchangable advance tickets or books
need not worry, but may get (teats to-morrow,
rather than next week. All teachers have these
tickets and books, and this being vacation week
they have not been called in. Also, the mu
sic houses have both. It Is a pleasant little
fiction, but still possible, for those desiring
reservations now to walk up to a school
teacher or music house, buy the exchangable
tickets and go and get what they want. This
isn't supposed to be done, but It la quite pos
sible tiat It will b*. nevertheless.
The season coui>on books have proved a de
sirable form of tickets for the festivals, sav
ing, as they do, $2 50 on each weekly series.
These are also secured anywhere by a lit
tle search. They cover every one of the events
of th* great week of music, these being as
follows:
Order of events by days â Sunday night, April
30. Inaugural night; Monday afternoon. May 1,

GOES ON SPREE
AND KILLS DOG
Charles Cook's Thirst for
Gore Ends When He Fills
Canine Full of Buckshot
THREATENS HIS SPOUSE
After Chasing His Wife.
Drunken Man Thinks of
the Pet and Changes Plan
Charles Cook's thirst for blood was
appeased last night when he wan
dered into his back yard and filled his
pet dog with a load of buckshot. Be
fore performing this sharpshooter's
act Cook whiled away a few idle mo
ments by chasing his wife about the
house and trying to make up his mind
whether to shoot her or the dog. He
finally agreed to dispose of the ca
nine and now he is sleeping off a glo
rious jag in the City Prison, uncon
scious of the fact that trouble awaits
him in the morning.
Cook- is- the proprietor of a coffee
(roasting establishment at 1947 Stock
ton street. Yesterday he went out
for an airing and while strolling
around town dropped into various
| places where the cheering beverage is
! always to be had. After stowing away
| a suitable quantity of the fiery liquid,
1 Cook started for home.
When he arrived early in the even
ing he began to abuse his wife in such
strong terms that she was compelled
to lay the matter before Policeman
Hines. The latter called informally
upon Cook and gave the coffee man a
lecture on the etiquette of a husband.
Cook promised to be good, so the
bluecoat went away.
But instead of being good, Cook
started out on another tour of inspec
tion. In his rambles he overlooked but
few of the spirit emporiums and when
he arrived home at a late hour he had
forgotten all about the gallant police
man and his warning.
Upon entering the house, Cook grab
bed his shotgun and proceeded to have
a little fun at the expense of his wife,
so the latter avers. He chased her
from room to room, threatening the
while that he would kill her as his
thirst for gore was so great it must be
appeased.
Suddenly Cook thought of , the dog.
It was a happy thought for the wife, at
least. The blood thirsty man rushed
into the yard and catching sight of the
pet canine fired twice. His aim was
true, though his feet were wobbly, and
the brute fell to the ground never to
rise again.
The shots attracted the attention of
Officer Hines and he did a double quick
hotfoot to the Cook abode to find Cook
proudly standing over the corpse of the
dog, his wife trembling with fear in
the house. The officer quickly did his
duty and locked Cook up in the City
Prison. Cook said something about
the dog's trying to bite a child, but
this did not save him from going: to
jail.
DEATH'S SHADOW
ON JEFFERSON
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., April
18. â Joseph Jefferson at midnight is
gradually growing weaker. His trouble
is a complication oorf r diseases, from
which he suffered last summer. His
physicians regard his condition as crit
ical in the extreme, and while he may
die at any moment there is a possibil
ity that he will rally and live for days,
or even weeks. The veteran actor
realizes that his end is near and looks
forward to it without fear.
For a number 'of years past Jefferson
and ex-President Cleveland have spent
a week or two of each year together
fishing in Florida. It was on his return
from one of these fishing trips that
Jefferson's illness developed. He went
to Hobe Sound about three weeks ago
on his annual fishing outing, and re
turned about ten days ago to his home
here after having taken a severe cold.
Me held his own until yesterday, when
his disease again took a turn for the
worse and it was seen that the end was
near.
At Jefferson's bedside are his wife
and sons, Charles B. and Frank Jeffer
son; his granddaughter, Marion Jef
ferson, and Mrs. Q. Symons, together
with hla secretary, Carl Kettler, and
hiÃ nurse, Mabel Bingham. Dr. Potter,
his physician, and Dr. Worley of St.
Augustine, who has been called in con
sultation, remain with him constantly.

BILL EXCLUDES
PAUPER ALIENS
Drastic Measure Is Intro- 1
duced in Commons by the!
British Home Secretary
PASSES FIRST READING
Proposed Law Would Con
fer Great Power Upon
the Immigration Officers
LONDON, April 18.â Home Secretary
Akers Douglas introduced another
aliens bfll in the House of Commons
to-day. It is much on the lines of last
year's measure, which the Govern
ment dropped on account of obstruc
tion.
The secretary, in introducing the bill,
commented upon the increasing
number of undesirable immigrants ar
riving in Great Britain. He said the
Government was determined to deal
with this organized traffic.
The measure prohibits immigrants
from landing except at ports where
an immigration officer Is stationed, and
only with his consent and after a med
ical inspection. Immigrants may be
refused permission to land tf nnable to
show that they axe In a position to
obtain means to keep themselves de
cently; if insane; if, on account of dis
ease or other causes, they are likely
to become a charge on the taxpayers:
if they have been sentenced abroad for
an extraditable crime, not of a politi
cal nature, or if they have been pre
viously expelled from Great Britain.
The Home Secretary may order the
expulsion of an alien on a certificate
from a court of law.
The bill, however, provides that an
alien shall not be refused permission
to land on account of want of means
If able to prove that he or she is seek
ing admission to Great Britain solely
to avoid persecution for political of
fenses.
The bill passed its first reading.
TUBERCULOSIS
THEIR THEME
ATLANTA, Ga., April 18.â Dr. Au
gustus P. Clarke of Cambridge, Mass
delivered an address to-day on "Some
Clinical Experiences In the Treatment
and Prevention of Tuberculosis" before
the Anti-Tuberculosis League. He said
in part:
The suppression of or the greater restric
tion of the carrying on of noxious trades of
methods of manufacture has often been at
tended with benefit. The withholding of li
censes of stables unless such buildings or
premises were made to .conform to the re
quirements of the public statutes and the
location to be used was sufficiently remote
from surrounding dwellings has been Instru
mental for great good. Indeed, the Boards
ol Health have In our own State almost un
limited power for the suppression of practices
that would affect Injuriously the public health.
Notwithstanding all this, matters now and
then have been allowed to go on to such
an extent that they have been far from being
Innocuous. It may b* said that the Boards ol
Health. possess almoÂ«t unrestricted power for
the abatement of unsanitary conditions. Such
members are amenable to the appointing power
and may be subject to the action of the Grand
Jury.
Dr. Henry O. Marcy of Boston deliv
ered an address on "Tubercular Perito
nitis in Women." He said:
Although the field of tuberculosis infec
tion of the peritoneum is fortunately a com
paratively limited one, the surgeon has by his
intervention made a moat valuable contribu
tion toward thd prevention, limitation and
cure of one phase of the moat widespread and
deadliest enemy of mankind.
Increased interest marked the sec
ond day's proceedings of the Anti-Tu
berculosis Congress to-day. Late ar
rivals brought the attendance up to
about 600 physicians, which Included
a large number of women practitioners.
An Important paper of the day was
read by Dr- C. P. Ambler of Asheville,
N. C, on "The Physician's Permanent
Duty to the Patient and Family in Tu
berculosis." At the conclusion of his
discussion. Dr. Ambler presented the
following points:
Firstâ Tuberculosis 1Â» not the fatal disease
It Is commonly believed to be.
Second â While communicable, it can bÂ« made
practically Innocuous by the proper course on
the part of the patient.
Third â The chief cause Â©t the large mortal
ity iB late diagnosis.
Fourth â Late diagnosis Is caused by the In
difference of the patient to early symptoms
and indifference on the part of the physician
consulted.
Fifthâ By thorough and â yatematir Instruc

complished than by medication.
Sixth â Instruction of patient and family and
friends and close observance on their part of

PARIS, April lg. â The disturbance*
at Limoges were the subject of a
live.'y debate In the Chamber of Depu
ties to-day. Etlenne, Minister of the
Interior, replying to interpellations,
said he deeply deplored the blood
shed. The authorities, however, he
said, were determined to maintain or

peaceful solution. Jaures I
argued that if American workmen it*
France declared a strike and causal
disturbances they would be expelled.
whereas the French army was placed
at the disposal of American employ
ers (meaning the Havilands). who had
occasioned the trouble.
After Premier Rouvier had stated
that the army h;*d not been placed at
any one's disposal, but that it had sim
ply been utilized for the preservation
of order, the House voted confidence
In the Government, 422 against 129.
The strike riots at Limoges are de

Haviland factory, employing SO. OOO
persons, of which Then,
Charles Haviland (Americans) are the
proprietors. Embassador Porter is
taking active steps to ensure the pro

violence and to secure an adjustment
between the proprietors of the factory
and the workmen. He conferred with
Foreign Minister Delcasse to-day
concerning the precautionary meas
ures which the Government Is taking.
The situation is complicated by strong
Socialist opposition to the Government
sending troops to Limoges. Riotous
scenes led to the massing of large
forces of cavalry and Infantry at Li

Three strikers were killed when
the troops fired on the mob last night

there were no letters in that package,
and one letter particularly, written in

Rheumatism
Like Neuralgia, is now known
to be a nervous disease. The
kidneys become weak through
lack of nerve energy, and fail
to filter the uric acid from the
blood; this acid attacks and
burns the nerves and muscles,
and consumes the oil in the
joints, producing inflammation,
fever, swelling â pain.
To cure Rheumatism, then,
you must restore the kidney
nerves and muscles, and neu-
tralize the effect of the acid
upon the joints and tissues
with Dr. Miles' Restorative
Xervine, a nerve medicine,
which has made many cures of
this painful disease. Xervine
strengthens the kidney nerves
and increases the circulation,
and relief is assured.
"Before I took Dr. Miles' Nervine,
I had been looking for a cure for
Rheumatism for 26 years. The last
time I waa laid up for several months,
could not get out of bed or set foot
ori the floor. I tried remedies to rub
In to drink, doctors' prescriptions,
r-tr but none of them had any effect.
One day I read about Dr. Miles*
N>rvlne and rot a bottle. After the
first dose I had a rood night's rest,
6.nd after taking: half a bottle the
pains disappeared, and I went out and
walked all around the town. In a week
I went to work, and waa perfectly
cured but continued to take the
medicine for a time, to make sure the
pains would not come^ck."

Politics are also injected into the pro
ceedings. Finally a vote was reached
and the proposed amendment was re
jected.
The question of polygamy was raised
by Mrs. T. S. Ham! in in her report as

Mrs. Mary F- Allen of Utah supported
the chaplain general's report, which
was unanimously adopted.

Epecia.l Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
ST. LOUIS, April 18.â Mr. and Mrs.
John Beaird of East St. Louis, whose
short and romantic courtship on a train
en route for Los Angeles, Cal., cul
minated in a wedding at the latter
place, have agreed to patch up their
difficulties out of court and go upon a
second honeymoon.
In the summer of 1902 John Beaird, a
wealthy merchant of East St. Louis,
started as a delegate to the Elks' con
vention In Salt Lake City. There were
two excursion trains. On the first were
Beaird and a large party of brother
Elks; on the second were E. de Wolf,
also an Elk, his wife and Mrs. F. H.
Hoeltfoestef, a young and pretty wid
ow, who was traveling with them and
the rest of the party of Elks. In the
mountains around Denver the first
train became stalled, and shortly after
ward the second train came up with
it. The Elks of both trains fraternized
up there in the snowclad hills, and it so
happened that Beaird met De Wolf and
De Wolf took him back in the train to
meet his wife and Mrs. Hoeltfoester.
Beaird became infatuated with the
charming young widow and remained
in the second train for the remainder
of the journey. When Salt Lake City
was reached Beaird remained on the
train, and by the time Los Angeles was
announced Mrs. Hoeltfoester had
agreed to become Mrs. Beaird.

STRIKE RIOTS
ARE FREQUENT
Chicago Non-Union Teamster
Wounded by a Bullet In-
tended for Union Men
STRANGER'S HARD LUCK
Mistaken for an Employe of
the Ward Company and
Beaten Into Insensibility
CHICAGO, April 19. â The first
shooting and the most serious assault
since the commencement of the Mont
gomery Ward strike occurred late this
afternoon at Van Buren and Sherman
streets. Charles Ocker, a non-union
teamster, was leaving the Atlantic
Hotel, when he was attacked by a
union picket. Ocker drew a revolver
and fired twice at his assailant, but
both bullets went wide and one of
them struck Walter Klager, a team
ster, who was unloading a wagon half
a square away. Ocker was arrested.
Klager's wound is not dangerous.
Shortly alter this affray John
O'Reilly of St. Louis, who was walking
on Van Buren street near the scene
of the shooting,^ was attacked by
union teamsters and beaten into in
sensibility. It was believed by the
teamsters that he had been working
for Montgomery Ward & Co., but
O'Reilly asserted that he had not been
working for the firm, had no intention
of doing so and until he was attacked
knew nothing about the strike at
Montgomery Ward's.
The firm experienced less difficulty
to-day in delivering goods than at any
time since the commencement of the
strike. All of its wagons made trips
to the freight depots under police
guard, and none of them were mo
lested.
The deadlock between the teamsters
and employes continues and there is
no indication of the end of the strike.
TRAMPLE ON THE FLAG. *

difficulty.
About 4000 strikers attended an
other meeting on the plaza at Ponce.
Orators of the American Federation
of Labor and President Sanchez of the
local organization addressed the men.
A disturbance ensued and the police
used their clubs, which was followed
by revolver shots from the crowd. The
situation became decidedly alarming,
but the firing brought reinforcements
of police and order was partly re
stored.

Oscar Wilde's "De Profundis"
Vigorously Attacked From
Westminster Abbey Pulpit
Sreclal Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 18. â Charles Mar
riott, whose first novel, "The Column,"
attracted extraordinary attention,
especially on the part of the critics,
has nearly finished another novel,
which he will call "The Man in
Armor," unless some better title oc
curs to him before next September.
The "armor" referred to in the title
Is in this case the hard shell of seem
ing indifference that a man sometimes
acquires as a protection from the
world's hard knocks.
Marriott is one of that colony of
artists in words and in paint which
has made the picturesque little Cor- ;
nish town of St. Ives famous. It is
recorded that the chief exports of the
town are fish, landscapes and novels.
Be that as it may, one could not find
a more kindly, unostentatious and
quick-witted companion for a walk
over the beautiful Cornish hills than
Marriott. It is a significant circum
stance that the artists and writers who
swarm in fc>t. Ives consider themselves
at liberty to open Marriott's front door
without knocking and saunter up
stalrs to his drawing-room at any
hour of the day or evening unan
nounced.
The latest addition to the St. Ives
colony is Frederic Whyte, who has
retired thither from London to write
his "Life of Dv Maurier," for which â 
Mrs. Dv Maurier and many friends of |
the late artist-author of "â¢Trilby" are !
helping to supply material. The life
of Dv Maurier has been suggested sev
eral times before, but Mrs. Dv Maur
ier has hitherto withheld her permis
sion. Arrangements for the publica
tion of the book in England and Amer
ica already have been made.
COMPARES WRITER TO DOG.
Although clever speeches were a
feature of "Dodo" and occur in abund
ance in E. F. Benson's other novels, '
the author himself is not great on
speechmaking outside his books. In
fact, he told the Authors' Society,
which entertained him at dinner the
other night, that he previously had
perpetrated only one solitary speech,
that effort having been made at the
debating society at Cambridge. Ben
son went on to assure the authors and
their guests that the existence of a
writer of fiction was a dog's life. He
had always to be doing tricks, and as
soon as he had done one trick he had
to begin thinking about learning an
other, while the public might be rep
resented as so many masters with
whips cracking at him and on him
if he should do them badly. Though
it was a dog's life, however. Benson
said he rather liked it, and so he pro
posed going on doing those tricks, al
though he might get a smack occa
sionally.
There was a special attraction about
"The Discovery of the Gaping Gulf,"
one of the antique books disposed of
last week at the sale of the John Scott
library. This volume was printed in |
the reign of Good Queen Bess and on ;
account of it both the author, one John j
Stubbs, and the publisher had their i
right hands cut off, Stubbs shouting
'"Ood Save Queen EliSabeth" during .
the operation.
ETON CLAIMS AMERICAN.
No little interest has been aroused
here by the Rev. A. Austen-Leigh's
discovery that one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence was edu
cated at Eton School. This announce
ment is made by Austen-Leigh, who is
Provost of King's College, Cambridge,
and an acknowledged authority on
matters connected with Eton, in a let
ter on "Americans at Eton in Colonial
Days." addressed to the Eton College
Chronicle. He points out that it was
no uncommon practice In the eigh
teenth century for Americans to send
their sons to England for their edu
cation. Some of these boys n\turally
found their way to Eton, but in the
almost complete absence of any rec
ords it is difficult to discover their
names. A few, however, have been
rescued from various sources. The
most important of these names traced
by Mr. Austen-Leigh is that of Thom
as Lynch. The following is his record
as established by Austen-Leigh's re
searches:
Lynch, Thomas, Â»on of Thomas Lynch Esq.
of Prince George's Parish, Wlnyah, South
Carolina <b. Aug. sth, 1749; school, Eton, 4
years under Mr. Barnard, age 18; admitted
Fellow Commoner at Calus Coll., Cambridge,
May 18th, 1767; admitted at Middle Temple,
1767)- Captain Continental Army. 1775-1776;
Member of CongTess, 1776-1777; signed the Dec
laration of Independence ; was lost at sea,
1779.
"Etonians have taken part in many
great events." remarks, Austen-Leigh,
"but it will probably be news to most
of us that one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence was edu

It is not often that a current book is I
either praised or condemned from the
pulpit of Westminster Abbey. Guy
Thome's novel "It Was Dark" was
however, commended not long ago by ,
the Bishop of London, preaching In
the Abbey, and now literary folk in
London are discussing the vigorous at
tack made there by Canon Beechlng
upon the late Oscar Wilde's "De Pro
fundis"âan attack which is especially
significant as showing the religious
point of view. The Canon, who has
been at the Abbey since 1892, is, how
ever, also a writer, having published
several original volumes and edited
both Milton and Shakespeare. Of "De
Profundis" he said: "It presents a cari
cature of the portrait of Christ, and es
pecially a travesty of his doctrine
about sin, that is quite astonishing."

BERLIN, April 18. â The project of
creating a fashionable drive of the
Sieges Allee in the Thiergarten,
similar to the Corso at Rome,
Rotten Row In London and the
Champs Elysees at Paris has

with the German Sport Society, an
aristocratic sporting club, and its
abandonment is due to the action of

drivers desired to drive through the
Thiergarten In the afternoon to see
the equipages of notable persons.

GOOD FRIDAY
SOLEMNITIES
Good Friday, which happens on the
21st of the month, the latest possible
', date, according to ecclesiastical enu
merators, will be observed this year
j more generally and by a larger num
ber of denominations than customary.
' The old feeling among sectarians
against observing church festivals and
fasts as superstitious and unnecessary
is fast vanishing, while their positive j
| value as historical facts is admitted.
The spread of secular observance of
the solemn fast is remarkable as de
j noting the weight of an element in
commercial affairs in favor of a recog
nition of the day. In this country,
i in common with all other Christian
< nations in Europe and elsewhere, Good
Friday is getting to be observed as
sacred to religion alone. The ex
changes in New York were the first
to close on Good Friday, and their ex
ample has been followed by those of
nearly all the great cities.
In this city the Produce Exchange
and the Stock and Bond Exchange
have decided to close and no business
will be transacted at either.
The customs in the Roman Catholic
church will be followed even more
stringently than ever. From Friday
i until Sunday the ceremonies of the
â  church will be informal, without the
brilliancy of illumination and the
studied pomp of ordinary days. The
â¢ lights will be dimmed upon the altars
j and somber draperies will enshroud
j the sanctuaries. The music will be of
\ the plainest at all the services and an
< impressive object lesson given of the
| darkness which came over the world
after the crucifixion and remained un
til the morning of the resurrection
brought light a^ain.
At the Cathedral and St. Ignatius the
i services will be deeply impressive.
I Among the Episcopal churches the day
; will be observed with the greatest pos
sible solemnity. All the churches will
open at sunrise and be open until late
at night. Services will only be in
terrupted at intervals to allow the
throngs an opportunity to visit them
for private devotion.
BUSINESS MEN'S SERVICES.
From 12:15 to 12:45 the rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce will be opened
for a service of meditation. Who will
officiate is* not announced. At the
Church of the Advent, Eleventh and
Market streets. Rev. C. N. Lathrop

by members from other church choirs
in this city, Qakland, Berkeley and
Alameda, constituting a large chorus.

be conducted by John de P. Teller, reg
ular organist of the church. Miss
Helen Colburn Heath, soprano, will be
soloist; Messrs. Arthur A. Macurda
and Richard H- Hunt, solo tenors; Al

OF A MEDIUM
Sad Plight of Elderly New
Hampshire Couple Is Due
to Clairvoyant of San Jose
SENT TO A SANITARIUM
Court Prescribes a Few
Weeks' Rest for Aged Pair
Jailed on Insanity Charge
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 18.â Mr. and Mrs.
Frank A. Drew, who were yesterday
arrested at 395 East St. John street on
charges of insanity, were examined be
fore Judge "Welch to-day. It appears
that the deplorable condition of the
Drews is due to an overdose of spiritu
alism. They are from Milford, N. H.,
where Drew was engaged in the marble
business. They are people of means
and have many thousands of dollars on
deposit in Eastern banks.
The visit to California was made for
the benefit of the health of Mrs. Drew.
The couple arrived in this State last
October. For a while they lived in Oak
land, coming here two weeks ago. They
met a clairvoyant here, and it Is be
lieved that he is the cause of their
present sad plight.
The physicians and Judge Welch
after examining the couple felt that
with rest and quiet the pair would soon
recover. As they are able to pay for
what they need it was arranged that
they should go to the Red Cross Sani
tarium for a few weeks, where they
will be under the watchful eye of Mrs.
Irene Frost, the police matron.

RALPH BROWN LAID
IN ETERNAL SLEEP
WHILE MINT MOURN
WELL-KNOWN BUSINESS MAN
WHO PASSED AWAY IN NEW
YORK CITY.
The funeral services of Ralph Brown
were held yesterday at 1:30 o'clock
from the residence of his brother,
Abraham Brown, 2209 Van Ness ave
nue. Rabbis Voorsanger and Nieto
officiated. The pallbearers were
Messrs. Joseph Hyman, Leopold Mi
chaels, Jacob Stern, Leopold Bach
man, Emanuel Stern, Henry Sshleln,
Sigmund L. Ackerman, Maurice
Schweitzer, I. S. Ackerman, Charles
Hirsch. Max Gans and Martin Triest.
After the services, which were largely
attended, the remains were taken by
special train to the Hills of Eternity
Cemetery at San I'ateo and placed in
the family vault.
Ralph Brown was a member of the
firm of Brown Bros. & Co. of this city
and had been ill for several months
past. He went to New York, hoping
that a change would benefit him. He
became suddenly worse, ;ind. an opera
tion being deemed necessary as a last
resort, he underwent the ordeal. He
did not recover, however, and passed
away in the New York Hospital on
Sunday, April 9.
Mr. Brown was one of those de
lightful men whose acquaintance was
valued by all and he was an ideal
companion.
He was for twenty-five years the
New York buyer for fhe wholesale and
retail clothing firm of this city which
bears his nÃme.
In early boyhood he moved with his
parents to The Dalles, Or., leaving
that place in 1867 for San Francisco,
at which time the firm of Brown Bros.
& Co. was organized by his father,
the late Lewis Brov.-n.
Mr. Brown was a most devoted hus
band, but not blessed with any chil
dren. He leaves a widow, who is the
daughter of the late Jonas Strauss,
brother of the late Levi Strauss. Three
sisters, Mrs. Philip Lippitt. Mrs. God
frey Fisher and Mrs. B. Sheidemar, all
of this city, and a brother, Abraham
Brown, also survive him.
San Francisco has lost one of Its
sterling business men in his death and
more than the family will mourn his
loss.

FINDS REMAINS
OF CANNIBALS
Bones of Prehistoric Men
Are Unearthed by Archae
ologist on Farm in Oregon
SKELETONS MUTILATED
Small Clay Altar Evidently
Used for Sacrifices Is
Found Near the Bodies
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALBANY, Ore., April 18.â While ex- j
cavatlng on a farm five miles south
west of Albany, near the bank of the
Calapooia River, J. G. Crawford of this
city discovered the remains of several
bodies of prehistoric men. and also a
small altar, undoubtedly used as a place
for sacrifices. The remains of five
bodies were found, the skeletons show
ing that all the bodies had been muti
lated.
Crawford, who had made a number
of excavations in different mounds In
this part of the State during the last
few years and who has acquired con
siderable reputation as an archaeologist
thinks the people undoubtedly were
cannibals. Most of the bodies found
were badly mutilated. In one skull
the whole face had been broken out
from the top of the head to the law.
while in two others a jaw and other
small parts of the face were missinz.
The altar, though small, was a per
fect one. It was built on a rock founda
tion, in oval form and was constructed
of clay, which had been burned until
it was as red as brick though not so
hard. The altar proper was twenty
four inches long and eighteen inches
wide. Crawford says there is no doubt
It had been used for sacrificial pur
poses and from what he has been able
to learn about the habits of this race
from his investigations, he thinks it
was the custom of the people to offer
the hearts of the dead on these little
altars as a burnt sacrifice to some deity.

WINE AT FAIR
MAKES TROUBLE
(lovernor Pardee Deluged
With Protests From Temp
erance and Keligious Bodies
EXECUTIVE EXPLAINS
Declares Law Provides That
Liquor Must Be Exhib
ited With Other Products
SACRAMENTO, April 18.â At th#
Governor's office for several days pro
tests from temperance and religious or
ganizations have been received against
the retail of wines and liquors in the
California State building* at the Port
land Exposition. In speaking of this
matter to-day Governor Pardee said:
It is evident that somebody has been mis
informed In this matter; they appear to think
that a bar is to be set up in the State build
ing at Portland for the retail of California
wines and brandies. That is all a mistake.
No such thing Is going to happen. In placing
California's exhibit in the State building at
Portland the law will be followed, of course.
Tbere Is no other way possible. We have no
choice In . the matter. The law says that in
the Stat* building there shall 'be a display
or exhibit of the products of the State of
California. Now wine is a product of Cali
fornia. just as much as grapes, potatoes,
threshing machines oranges or heps are pro
ducts and therefore wine- must, under thÂ»
provisions of the law. be exhibited Just thÂ«
same as other articles produced In the State.
When the conditions are . made clear I pre
sume that there wilt be no further objections
urged In this recard.
Musician Turns on Giu*.
Claude H. Merriweather. a one

night in a lodging-house at 11 Turk

room. When his body was found
both gas burners were open. He has
a wife and two children in Los An

Refusal of Request Leads to Conflict
and Finale in Police Court
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
After hit horse had been caught
straying and waa officially Impounded.
Simon Bergr, peddler of fruit, took his
buxom HtUÂ« wife and three chubby
children from their home at 121 Con
gress street, escorted them to the place
aC thÂ« animal's detention and requested
that they, too, be taken In and cared
for.
"For," he said, "you have deprived
me of their only means of support, and
it's but fair that you provide for them
tzntll I am again able to do so."
There waa conflict of testimony as to
what happened after that. The pound
men testified that they softly advised
Mr. Berg to proceed to the office of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
: Animals and there obtain release of his
horse by depositing a sum of $3. while
Mr. Berg and . his better half averred
that he was set upon and brutally beat
en by one Edward Tumelty. â  an at
tache of the pound, whose arrest for
r.attery followed. Mr. Berg displayed to
Police Judge Cabaniss a face criss
crossed with plaster strips as evidence
that the battery was really anil truly
committed. Mrs. Berg declared that
Mr. Tumelty. a strapping fellow, was
brutality personified in his maltreat
ment of her husband. Patrolman
Jewell said that Mr. Berg endeavored
to amputate one of Mr. Tumelty's
thumbs by gnawing it. Miss Annie
Schultz swore she saw two poundmen
beating Mr, Berg, and that it was per
fectly shameful, because Mr. Berg was
*Â»o little and his assailants were so big.
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ;
contributed to the Tumelty side of the
testimony. .
â¢'They called me a Russian Nihilist,"
Mr.. Berg informed the court, "and
threatened to kill me if I did not go
away and stop talking to them."
But even this clinching averment fir
the prosecution failed to convince' his
Honor that the defendant's guilt of
battery was clearly proved, and an or

Harry Britt was committed for trial
in the Superior Court on two charges
of burglary. He rifled rooms at 119
Fourth street. Judge Cabanlss fixed
the bail at $2000.
Among the many passengers aboard
a westbound ferry-boat last Sunday
afternoon were Lucas Amaico and Ca
tilla Amas, buoyant spirited sons of
Italy, whose horseplay pranks an
noyed some of the feminine occupants
of the upper deck to such an extent
that complaint wa6 filed with the of
ficer on duty, who ordered the of
fenders to go below and stay there.
While obeying the command Lucas
playfully plucked the hat from Ca
tilla's head and tried to hurl It to
Goat Island, several hundred yards
away and of course the headgear foil
far short of the target and dropped
into the tide. In similar kittenish
mood, Catalli drew from its sheath
the long and keen knife which was his
inseparable companion and with it
made a slash at Lucas' neck. Lucas
nimbly dodged the blow and what he
would have done in the way of mirth
ful retaliation shall never be known,
because both he and Catilla were in
stantly overpowered by brawny deck
hands and held in custody until the
boat docked, when they were trans
lerred to the keeping of Policeman
Malcolm.
"These men were merely skylark-
Ing," said an attorney engaged for
the defense, "which we shall be able
to prove if we are given time to find
certain witnesses."
"Case continued till April 25," re
sponded Judge Mogan, "and in the
meantime I would suggest that the
defendants abstain from indulging
their peculiar spirit of humor."
â¢ â¢ "â¢
Joe Willey's claim to Mexican na
tivity and pure Castilian parentage
! was received with skepticism by the
' anthropologists in Judge Mogan's
: courtroom because (1) of the coarse-
ness of his facial features and the
darkness of his complexion; (2) the
wooliness of his hair; (3) the proved
thickness of his cranium, and (4) the
quality of his dialect. His nose waa
?patulous his lips puffy, his skin al
most ebony and his hair kinky. The
impression of Ethiopian descent con
veyed by these visible characteristics
was not marred by his voicing of Engr
lish or the charge that his skull had
(â¢merged unscathed from repeated
violent collisions with wooden doors
and brick walls. The dab of sticking
plaster nestling amid his forelocks
covered a 3esh wound received when
he butted a plate glass door panel to
fragments, but the skull itself was in
tact.
"Spaniard nothing," said Bailiff
Hickey, surveying Mr. Willey with
analytical eye. 'If he ain't seven
eighths coon I'm a dago."
"That boy was born many a mile
north of the Mexican line," was Clerk
"Pat" Gray's finding, "and I'd bet
he'd give a hundred tamales for one
slice of watermelon."
Bailiff Mahoney's opinion was ex
pressed in his summons of Mr. Wil
ley to the bench. "Come out here,
Rastus," he said. Mexican prisoners
are invariably addressed as "Pedro"
by the court officers.
As complainant against Mr. Willey
appeared John Foley, son of Mrs.
Buckley, residing at 927 Broadway.
Without known reason or the least
warning: Mr. Willey utilized his head
as a battering ram against the front
door of Mrs. Buckley's domicile.
splitting woodwork and shattering to
fragments a thick plate-glass panel.
As he butted he uttered fierce howls,
to the great terror of Mrs. Buckley
and other Inmates of the dwelling,
and when Patrolman Flynn and a
posse arrived and undertook to effect
his subjugation he gave them a lively
tusele before they succeeded. After
fracturing the door, it was testified, he
transferred his headwork to adjacent
walls and had the house a-shlver un
der his blows.
An attorney announced that there
would be a defense, and the Judge set
to-day for its launching.
Four Jurors were sworn to hear the
charge of "selling a pool" which the
Grand Jury has entered against
"Dick" Creighton. cashier for "Zick"
Abrams, and Judge Mogan expects the
panel will be completed to-day. The
defense challenged freely and on
many grounds, the talesman being
asked almost every known and un
known question with the exception of
that relative to the age of Ann. The
work of securing eight more good and
true men will be resumed at 10:45
o'clock this morning.
Frank Roberts denied the charge
that his intent was suicidal when he
purchased two vials of carbolic acid
on as many different occasions within
ono day and gulped a portion of the
contents of each in his apartment at
11?5 Dupont street.
"Then what did you do it for?"
Judge Mogan inquired.
"I just wanted to -prove to some of
my friends that poison could easily
be bought by any one who wanted it,"
was the answer. "I purchased both
bottles at the Union Drug Store, on

"We Expect to Prove"
Sceclfcl Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. April 18.â District
Attorney Seymour made his opening
address to the jury this afternoon in
the case of Harry Bunkers, one of the
four expelled Senators Indicted for
bribery. An adjournment was taken
until to-morrow morning, when the
actual trial will begin.
Senators French and Wright, who
are also awaiting trial, sat with Bunk
ers while the Indictment was read to
him. Gavin McNab, William Corbin
and Clarence Grange of San Francisco
were In the courtroom and will be
called as witnesses to-morrow. It is ex
pected that the evidence for the prose
cution will be practically the same as
that adduced before the Senate inves
tigating committee on whose report the
four Senators were deprived of their
seats.
The first sign of a tilt between the
lawyers In the case occurred this after
noon, when Attorney Morehouse asked
the court to instruct the District At
torney not to refer to the statements he
might make in his opening statement
as facts. Seymour showed by his rising
color that he resented the imputation,
but before he Had a chance to reply
Judge Hart stated that District Attor
ney Seymour had made numerous open
ing statements before juries and that
he needed no instructions as to his
manner of doing so. Throughout the
statement made by Seymour he empha
sized for Morehouse's benefit his oft
repeated words, "We expect to prove."
SHINGLE MILLS
LOSING MONEY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 18.â Four hundred
shingle manufacturers of the Sound
country are unhappy over the demor
alized condition of the shingle market.
In spite of the bitter past experiences
the shingle men cannot stand together
long enough to secure a shutdown of
the mills during midsummer and mid
winter, thereby stopping the overpro
duction.
In the Eastern markets there is a
stiff demand for shingles only in the
spring and fall. The operation of shin
gle mills eight months in a. year would
furnish an ample supply for both local
and Eastern markets. Cedar stumpage
near tidewater is becoming scarce, with
the result that the logs are constantly
increasing in price. The mills on tide
water cannot operate with profit with
the present prices of logs and shingles.
The situation shows no sign of improve
ment. The last three months have been
more disappointing than any previous
period.
MAN AND WIFE
ADMIT GUILT
Pl>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 18.â Mr. and Mrs. L.
A. Freestone have pleaded guilty at
Juneau to stealing $600 in gold amal
gam from the Treadwell mines, of
which Freestone was head amalgama
tor. Mrs. Freestone was arrested in
Seattle, where she had deposited the
amalgam in an assay office. She said
her husband had taken the gold from
the mine during the last four months
and instructed her to bring it to Puget
Sound and convert it into gold coin.
Freestone held an important position
and the Juneau authorities believe he
will be given a long sentence at Mc-
NelU Island prison as a warning to
others. Mrs. Freestone probably will
get off with a light sentence. She is
highly educated and the pair moved in
the best society of Juneau.

HOPE TO CURE
DESERTION EVIL
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, April 18â The Navy De
partment has inaugurated a new plan
for the abatement of the desertion evil
which is causing widespread comment
in naval and Government circles. Iri
charge of Sergeant Charles Borchert,
United States Marine Corps, nine de
serters Irom the U. S. S. Tacoma are
now en route to Galveston, Texas,
where they will be placed aboard one
of the vessels of the navy and sent
back to the Tacoma at Norfolk. The
men, who are members of the marine
corps, deserted the Tacoma when it was
announced that she was to sail around
the Horn to the Eastern coast. They
are now being returned to the ship at
their own expense. In addition to
losing all the back pay due them, the
deserters will be punished by an
abridgment of many privileges. Here
tofore it has been the practice of en
listed men of the navy, who did not
desire to make the cruise on which
their ship had been ordered, to procure
a ten days' shore leave and then after
their ship had sailed show up at an
other Government station and report
for duty. They were not treated as
deserters, and were only lightly pun
ished and assigned to the station where
they reported or to one of the vessels
at that station.
This practice has worked a serious
injury to the effectiveness of discipline
and the new plan has been adopted In
the effort to stop the practice.
BRINGS CREW
OF THE TACOMA
VICTORIA, B. C, April 18.â The
steamship Empress of China arrived
from Yokohama to-day, bringing the
crew of the blockade runner Tacoma,
which was captured by the Japanese
after being caught In the ice of Soya
Strait. Captain Connauton remained
to look after the vessel and Chief Offi
cer Chlpperwald and Engineer Ray
mond remained at Hakodate. It was
erroneously reported that they had
been drowned.
Igorrotes from the Philippines,
bound to Portland for the Lewis and
Clark Fair, were also among the pas
sengers of the Empress of China. Lord
Hawke, the celebrated English crick
eter, and Viscount and Viscountess
Castlereagh were also passengers.
FEAR OUTSIDER
WILL GET PLACE
REDDING, April 18.â A rumor that
Governor Pardee would appoint an
outside man Superior Judge of this
county caused consternation here to
day. The local aspirants kept the
wires hot trying to learn the Gover
nor's Intention. A monster mass meet
ing last night sent a strong prayer to
the Governor not to make any appoint
ment. Rumor has it that a San Diego
man is to get the judgeship.
FLAG IS RAISED
ON THE LAWTON
VALLEJO, April 18.â The flag of
Commander William Winders was
raised over the United States Steamer
Lawton at Mare Island to-day and the
transport is now a training ship for the
young men of the American navy. The
ceremony was brief and was without
any spectacular features.
The repairs on the Lawton are not
yet completed and it will be several
days before all the work under way is
finished. Many of the officers of the
Buffalo, who were not transferred to
the Lawton with the majority of the
ship's complement and who have orders
to report at other stations, were de
sirous of getting away from the Buffalo
and for this reason the commissioning
of the Lawton took place to-day.

IN MEMORY
OF HIS FRIEND
OAKLAJs'D. April 18.â Over the lone
ly grave of Colonel Thomas Garrity.
formerly ope of the most popular of
Oakland's attorneys, but now almost
forgtrtten in the press of current
events, stands a plain marble head
stone, placed there by Gee Norn, a
Chinese known as the "Lottery King"
aklaind.
Of ell those who during the life
of Tom Garrity were proud to be num
bered among hi 6 friends, only one, and
be of a different race and color, thought
i. h of the one who had passed
away to seek out hiÃ last resting place
and mark it with a token of regard.
Every year since Garrity's death Gee
Norn has visited the grave to invoke
eternal rest for the spirit of the dead.
At last the spot became so neglected

HARNETT IS JAILED
FOR TWENTY CENTS
"Steamship Man Is Arrested
Has Trouble on Ferry-Boat and Says He Will
Not Pay His Bill Twice.
OAKLAND, April 18.â Benjamin A.
Harnett, assistant manager of the To
yo Risen Kaisha, the Japanese steam
ship line, with offices at 421 Market
street, San Francisco, suffered arrest, a
ride in Oakland's police patrol wagon
and other unpleasantness early this
morning because he stood upon prin
ciple, according to Harnett's explana
tion of a dispute over twenty cents
with the steward of the Southern Pa
cific Company's ferry boat Berkeley.
Also did Assistant Manager Harnett
find a charge of defrauding an inn
keeper registered against him at the
city prison, but this morning the
charge was stricken from the police
court docket because the alleged offense
had been committed outside the mu
nicipal boundaries of Oakland.
It was on the last trip of the Berke- i
ley from San Francisco at 12:25 o'clock j
thlp morning that hunger assailed Har- i
nett. He repaired to the dining room
and partook of succulent doughnuts '
and a cup of aromatic coffee, for which !
the waiters check called for twenty
cents to be paid at the counter. Har
nett started away, according to the
steward, without settling the score.
The steamship manager indignantly
declared he had paid by placing two
dimes and the check on the cash reg
ister stand.
"I didn't get it and you didn't pay,"
asserted the steward.
"I did pay and you get no more
money from me," announced Harnett,
producing his personal card to disclose
his identity to the obdurate steward.
"Well, you don't leave this boat
until you settle," declared the steward,
summoning two husky railroad police
men, Dunne and Greeley by name.
These took charge of Harnett, who
persisted in his stand, and escorted
the prisoner to West Oakland, where he
was given Into the custody of the mu
nicipal authorities. Harnett was re
leased on ball after his arrest.
District Attorney Allen refused to
take further steps after the court had
disposed of the case.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1O ; 1905.
TELLS OF PARIS
CONVENT'S AIM
French Professor at State
University Describes the
31aking of Society Girl
BERKELEY, April 18. â Attracted
in part by the fascinating title of his
French lecture, and partly by one
of the most interesting and magnetic
personalities of the university faculty,
an audience, chiefly feminine, that
filled to overflowing the students' hall
in the observatory, listened this after
noon to M. Robert Dupouey's dis
course on "The Life of a French Girl
in a Stylish Convent in Paris." The
lecture is the first of a series to be
given by the French scholar dealing
with the life and social activities of
French women, each being delivered
in the French tongue "of Paris, in
which Dupouey is naturally a master.
He spoke in part as follows:
At the time the long war between church
and state In France Is ending with victory
for the state It may be Interesting to put
Catholic education opposite state education
by two contrasting examples. Therefore the
lecturer proposes to-day to describe the edu
cation of a girl in a stylish convent of Paris
and nest Thursday ho will tell of the studies
of another girl in one of the laio lycees.
Mile. Simone Is the Imaginary name of a
girl who is raally living in Paris. Her grand
parents, whose ancestors were driving the
plow in the small estate, situated in a re
mote part of the province, suddenly become
millionaires by a lucky series of rich In
herltanres; consequently the father of Simons
married a girl of a higher social rank than
his own ami having removed his home to
Paris endeavored to become acquainted with
the most aristocratc society of that city. His
determination and wealth and the cleverness
of his wife helped him in succeeding, In part,
but he is even now feeling some condescension
in the attitude of his new friends. He 1Â»
with them, but he It not yet â he never will bÂ«
â one of them.
By sending their daughter to the moat
stylish and aristocratic convent of Paris, thÂ«
so-called Cours de l'Assomptlon, situated at S
Lutsecke street, the object of the parents
wag to give her the company and friendship
of the girls of the noblest families, to efface
in her mind and soul all trace* of her plebeian
origin and thus to fa^litate the means of her
being completely ana without any restraint
accepted by the best aristocracy of France.
In fact the convent took hold of Simon*
so skillfully and actively that now she is quite
bent and trained to her future role of an
aristocratic lady. Tha convent supplied her
with all accomplishments necessary to a per
son belonging to the nobility.
First, the school has rarefied, as It were,
humanity all around Simone by allowing her
no cjther companions, no other friends than
the girls and the young men of the highest
social cast.
Second, It has taught her in sciences, liter
ature art and ethics only that which she
will have opportunity of using in her worldly
life. In the conversation of the salons.
Third, it has presented religion to her chiefly
as a society enterprise, as a fashionable and
stylish occupation destined to bind more closely
together the people of the same condition.
At last the school has shaped and polished
the political opinions of Simon* bo as to make
them the perfect mirrors of aristocracy, antl
republicanlem and royallsm by representing
such opinions to her as lndissolubly associate
with a well-understood religion.
Mr. Dupouey gave a circumstantial
account of the foregoing processes,
showing by many illustrations that
the stylish convent provides "Simone"
with what the lecturer called a "su
perficial knowledge of all sorts of
things," so that, as he declared, she
will never stoD short in any talk,
about any subject, also Illustrating
how the convent impresses on the
mind of "Simone" "prejudices and er
rors," because these are the prejudices
and errors of the world in which she
is to live.
Concluding his lecture Mr. Dupouey
said:
In short, the convent has made Simone &
society woman more than a woman, in the
br4ad sense of that word. Simone will now
be distinguished and bright; she will know
how to dress, how to talk, how to smile.
Maybe Fhe will not know how to live. The
Jaic lyceÂ«s give th* girls a stronger a more
human education. That education will be the
subject of my next lecture.

Barter of Little Children
OAKLAND, April 18.â Judge W. H.
Waste declared himself in no unmis
takable terms this morning in regard to
the trafficking In babies, and said to
Miss Helen Swett of the Associated
Charities: "This sale of -babies makes
my blood boil, and it must be stopped,
and will be if I have anything to do
with it." He then ordered Mrs. Ame
lia Funke of Alameda, from whom the
baby was bought, and also the woman
who made the purchase, to be produced
in court to-morrow morning.
The present instance of the sale of a
baby was brought up when Attorney
George E. Jackson applied for letters
of guardianship on behalf of the Asso
ciated Chaxitles fqr a child called Edna
Robinson, for the purpose of the present
proceedings. The child was bought
from Mrs. Funke for JlO by a woman

Miss Swett, but who has been ordered
to be In court to-morrow njorning.
After buying the baby the woman con
cluded that she did not want It and now
wants the Associated Charities to take
it. The parents are unknown, except
possibly to Mrs. Funke. The woman
who bought the child, however, must
come into court and tell her story, not
withstanding any promise that Miss
Swett may have made to the contrary.
ACCEPTS HONOR
FROM OLD YALE
BERKELEY, April 18.â The dispatch
from New Haven printed In The Call
to-day regarding the election of Pro
fessor C. M. Bakewell to a professor
ship in the philosophy department at
Yale gave the university public here the
first Intimation It had that Professor
Bakewell contemplated leaving Cali
fornia. The University administration
officials express regret at the prospect
of losing Professor Bakewell, but refer
also to the honor shown to the profes
sor.
It is understood that Professor Bake
well is to be at the head of the depart
ment of philosophy at Yale, making
him a commanding figure in a great
university. Professor Bakewell has not
yet resigned his place as associate pro
fessor of philosophy here, in Professor
George H. Howison's department, but
he is expected to resign in a few days.
He expresses pleasure at being chosen
by the Yale administration and regret
at leaving here.
Professor Bakewell took his degree
at Harvard, and then taught at Bryn
Mawr in Pennsylvania. He has been
in the department of philosophy at the
State University of California for
about seven years. He Is the fourth
man to be chosen by the big Eastern
universities from the philosophy â¢ de
partment here, as Professor Joslah
Royce preceded him to the East, hay-
Uig been called by Harvard several
years ago. Both these men were stu
dents under Professor Howison, the
distinguished philosopher and univers
ity instructor. Professor Bakewell is
one of the few men who have been
elected to membership In the Phi Beta
Kappa when an alumnus.
The philosophy department of the
University of California has suffered
the loss in the last few years of four of
its strongest men, this illustrating, in
the opinion of educational leaders, the
strength of the department controlled
by Professor Howison. The four men
who have been taken from California
are Charles McGllvary, George M.
Stratton, Josiah Royce and Charles M.
Bakewell. All have gone to larger
universities.

Dr. W. F. Bancroft of the physiological de
partment of the university has succeeded la
showing important connection between the
contraction of arm muscles and the behavior
of microscopic organisms under electrical stim
ulation, as the result of experiments made by
him. The experiments were carried on with
parameclum, a microscopic animal, whose body
is covered with a coat of short, delicate, hair
like projections called cilia. There are neither
muscles nor nerves In parameclum. Dr. Ban
croft, found, however, on examining their re
action to a constant electric current that when
the current waÂ« made the cilia would reverse
only at the end of the animal nearest the
cathode, and when the current was broken
the cilia reversed their natural unstlmulated
position at the anode only.

POSSOFUME GO
Sam Possofume, the Italian who ar
rived at 736^ Green street shortly after
Mrs. Rosa Torturici was arrested, was
charged yesterday with carrying a con
cealed weapon. An attempt will be
made by Attorney Spinetti to have the
man released on a writ of habeas cor
pus. The police believe that Posso
fume >uld throw some light on the
THwrtn murder if he dared, and have
no Intention of letting him go
- 'fume was taken Into custody
because of suspicious circumstances.
On th<' morning of April 8 he went to
the Green -street house where Vilardo
was butchered, asking for Torturici.
He was immediately placed under ar
;.nd when searched a murderous
c dirk was found upon him. This
wtap.'i furnished the police the means
p him. Captain Burnett is
< onfidf-nt that Possofume can give
s.me clew to the identity of the gang
that plotted the Vilardo atrocity.
Am yet the police have no trace of
Torturici. At all hours of the day
I'inan receives reports and tele
gram? from people who are confident
ihat they have seen the fugitive.
Every one of these stories is run
jis soon as it is received.
-iffs and constables over all the
State are nn the lookout for the al
leged murderer. All trains eastward
bound are searched. Particular atten
tion is paid to freight trains. Tor
turici had no money and the police
believe that he might try to "beat"
his way.
The man who was arrested at Grid
ley on Monday is not Torturici. Chief
Dlnan received word from Detective
Bunner that the "suspect" is a half
witted tramp.
A tip came to the police that a man
resembling Torturici had recently
Joined the Norrls and Rowe Circus
at VallÂ«Jo. All the employes of the
Fhow were lined up by the Vallejo po
lice, but no one resembling the fugi
tive waa found. A German named
Karl Muller recently arrived from
New York, told Captain Burnett last
night that he had seen a man resem
bling the accused murderer near Sac
ramento. Burnett takes no stock In
the story.
The furniture of the Torturici home
at 736*4 Green strwt was taken to the
Hall of Justice yesterday and stored
in the basement.

SMEDBERG MAY
BE PROMOTED
Colonel W. R. Smedberg, who was
chosen recorder of the Loyal Legion
thirty-five years ago, when the Califor
nia commandery of the order was es
tablished, and who has been re-elected
to that important position at every an
nual election since, Is slated for promo
tion. He will be elected commander at
the meeting next month, and there is
gossip that the event will be celebrated
by a large throng of the companions.
After serving a year at the head of the
order in this State Colonel Smedberg
may be called on to resume his duties
as keeper of the records.
There is an active sentiment in Loyal
Legion circles in favor of recognizing
the services which Colonel Smedberg
has rendered to the order. Nothing can
add to his military renown, as he
served at the front in the greatest cam
paigns of the Civil War and was pro
moted for bravery on a battlefield
where he sustained the loss of a leg.
There are indications that the depart
ment encampment of the Grand Army
of the Republic at Marysville next
month will be largely attended. The
propressive citizens of Tuba County
are making extensive preparations to
welcome and entertain the veterans.
Signs point to quite a contest for Grand
Army leadership. At Marysville there
may be some agitation in favor of in
dorsing a Californian for national com
mander in chief. Hitherto comrades of
the Pacific Coast have not been able
to agree on a candidate for the highest
office in the Grand Army.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1905.
RESULT SUITS
LOCAL UNION
The decision handed down by the
Amalgamated Society of Carpenters
and Joiners of America refusing: to
affiliate with the English Union has
been well received by the local car
penters' union. The San Francisco
members did not take kindly to the
plan, and therefore the doingrs of the
amalgamated body at Indianapolis
have been watched with much interest.
When the news of the defeat of the
project was received the local carpen
ters were Jubilant.
While there are no differences exist
ing between the countries so far as
union rules are concerned, there is a
difference in the financial status. The
English organization has embodied
beneficial, death, sickness and lost tools
clauses. These bring the monthly
dues up to almost twice those in
America. The union of carpenters
across the . ocean consists of four
classes subject to all the rules and
beneficial clauses, while the American
union has only the union laws and each
separate union fixes its own local
benefits for sickness and members in
jured while at wor.k.
To consolidate these two great bod
ies into one organization has been un
der consideration for a number of
years. Time and again the matter was
up for discussion before national con
ventions on both sides of the Atlantic,
until eventually it was referred to a
board of arbitration, with Strossel,
president of the Cigarmakers* Union of
America, as chairman. The final ac
tion was decided by the delegates as
sembled in Indianapolis by more than
a two-third vote rejecting the amal
gamating of the two bodies.
This action and its bearing on both
countries are what occupied the minds
of the members who have given the
matter thought for a number of years.
The 7000 American members who are
affiliated with their English brethren
were hopeful of better results, as it
would be of immense benefit to them
to have the thousands of American
members Join them., But their hopes
are dashed to the ground by the vote
announced.
The Butchers' National Union, taking
it for granted that the New York law
on hours of labor was constitutional,
before being declared unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court in Washington,
adopted the following as one of the
rules of the union:
A law regulating the employment and hours
of labor of children and minors under cer
tain agps has been received at headquarters
and ivaÂ» read at the last regular meeting.
This law was approved on February 20, 1900,
and Is now In force. Section 1 reads, that no
minor under the age of 18 shall work more
than nine hours per day or fifty-four hours
per week. Section 2 reads, that no minor un
der the agÂ« of 16 shall work between the
hours of 10 p. m. and 6 a. m. No child
under 14 years of age shall be employed unless
he has a permit from a Superior Judge,
statin* that the child is over 12 years of age
and that the parents of such child are In
capacitated for labor through Illness. No
minors under 16 shall be permitted to work,
unless they can read and writs English or are
regular attendants of some night school.
Violations cf the above law In any estab
lishment connected with the meat Industry
should bÂ« reported at headquarters at once.
The strength of the Bricklayers' In
ternational Union, as shown by late
returns, gives new locals added during
the past year, making the total num
ber of 875 locally affiliated with the
parent organization. The total mem
bership is set down at 82,000, with a
fund in the treasury of $750,000, which
is said to be more than that of any
other international organization.
STOCKTON. April 18.â J. C. Floyd, who

Mexican named Juan Dlas. died early thia
morning at the Receiving Hospital.
ROBBERS SLASH
CLERK'S THROAT
Clyde Sanders, a clerk residing at 217
Ninth street, Oakland, reported a vici
ous and daring hold-up to the police
at the Harbor Station late last nieht.
An assault for the purpose of robbery
was made upon him by two men, and
when he offered resistance a knife was
drawn across his throat and he was
beaten on the head. When Sanders
fell insensible to the sidewalk the
thieves continued their work and took
$130 and a gold watch and chain .rom
his pockets. As soon as the injured
man recovered he hastened to the
station and was later treated at the
Harbor Hospital for his injuries.
Sanders says he was walking down
Sacramento street in the direction of
the ferry building for the purpose of
going to his home, when two men step
ped from the doorway of a building
near Front street and demanded that
he pass over whatever money and
valuables he had in his possession.
Sanders stopped and, seelne that both
of the highwaymen were apparently
unarmed, concluded to battle for his
property. Instead of permitting the
men to search him he stepped to the
robber who was closest to him and the
two grappled. Sanders proved more
than a match for his single adversary
and when the latter was about over
come he shouted to his companion to
cut the clerk's throat.
With an oath the other highwayman
who, until this time had permitted his
pal to fight the battle single handed,
stepped up to Sanders and drew a knife
across his throat. Not content with
wielding the blade the robber then
walked behind his bleeding victim and
dealt him a severe blow on the head
with some blunt instrument. Sanders,
stunned and exhausted, dropped to the
sidewalk and the robbers looted his
clothes.
It required some time for Sanders to
recover. No one was in sight and he
lay in a pool of blood feebly crying for
help. When he was able to regain his
feet he continued his way down Sacra
mento street and some stranger di
rected him to the police station, where
it was found he had a deep gash in
the throat extending almost from ear
to ear and a severe abrasion of the
scalp. After telling the police his
story the man was hurried to the Har
bor Hospital and when the wounds
were dressed he was taken to Oakland
by a friend.
Detectives got a description of the
men, who were not masked, and a
watch was kept on the commercial
section during the night.
ACCUSED DEFAULTER WIL.I;
BE TRIED IN FRANKFORT
George Miller, Who Is Charged With
Stealing $5000, Will Be Taken
East To-Day.
George Miller, who is wanted in
Frankfort, Ind., for embezzling $5000
from the firm of W. M. Shafor & Co.,
will leave for Frankfort to-day in cus
tody of Sheriff Corns, who was sent
to this city to bring the prisoner back
there for trial.
Miller was a trusted salesman in
the employ of the grocery house. Sev
eral months ago it waa found that
Miller was short in his accounts. He
suddenly disappeared and nothing was
heard of him until a week ago, when
Detective Harry Braig while on Mont
gomery street recognized Miller from
a photograph he had seen and placed
him under arrest.
Miller's accounts were found to be
short $5000, and It is expected that
these figures will be largely increased
when the investigation is completed.
PLAY UNWORTHY
OF MISS ANGLIN
"Dukes at three a penny." not to
speak of possible Prime Ministers, are
handsomely scattered over the cast of
"The Crossways," playing at the Cali
fornia this week. "The Crossways," or
"The Cookmaid's Delight"â one takes
the liberty of substitutingâ is a play to
ravish the back stairs. It should de
light them almost as deeply aa the im
mortal Laura Jean's works. The way
her Grace tears round in sables and
spangles, in point d'Alencon wrappersâ
oh, peignoirs, to be sure! â and in silver
opera cloaks that make Lohengrin fade
away is simply grand.
Of course, her Grace has a lover and
a French maid, and a husband who is
mean enough to object to her going to
the opera alone with her lover. He is a
curious person, the husband. At one
moment he tells the bejeweled lady
that he would rather have taken a gut
ter maid to the ducal throne than the
said bejeweled lady. The next moment
he is imploring her to forgive If not to
forget, love. To the casual observer it
would seem that the forgiving stunt
should have been done by the dook.
Still, we have the French maid's testi
mony for it that he is " 'orrid, and she
'ates him." And, drat It, one cannot find
either that the duchess has a Past. She
has evidently a very present temper
and a real high-toned attack of nerves
in the second act. Personally, I feel for
the dook.
The conspirators â collaborators â in
the case are J. Hartley Manners and
Mrs. Langtry, who acted In the play
when it was first produced in New
York. Now, Mrs. Langtry should know
something about dukes and such. We
all know that she was banished from
their august society for wasting ice
cream upon the Prince of Wales' royal
spine. Perhaps they do act like Noel,
Duke of Keensbury, Lord Scarlett and
Sir Charles Croffte. If so, no wonder
the Peerage â who is it calls It the
"Beerage?"â is destined to destruction.
For, seriously enough Mr. Manners'
puppets crumble at a touch. They are
beautifully unreal, glltterlngly uncon
vincing. Take the lover, Sir Charles
Croffte. He is a politician who has
given up the hope of a premiership for
the sake of her Grace. As Peter Rob
ertson aaks. Why? There has been no
scandal, no cause for scandal. But the
piece bristles with "whys?" Things
are done without reaÃon. in absolute
unaccord with what one has previously
been told of them, by all of the charac
ters. Naturally the situations, strong
in themselves in places, fail of any
effect.
Miss Anglin as her Grace does all
that could be expected. But even Miss
Anglin cannot make bricks without
straw. Her Duchess of Keensbury is
gowned most convincingly, and she is
as hoity-toity with the Duke, ac high
minded with the lover â who steals
her pearls, and all the rest of the
things the score calls for. But Miss
Anglin is too Intelligent to play such
a part without an atmosphere of re
sentment exhaling from the work.
One wonders, indeed, at her presenta
tion of such a play.
Frank Worthing as the gentleman
who steals th pearls, tries to steal the
lady, and then lectures the Duke on
the sinfulness of jealousy, failed
honorably. So, too. Edwin Emery as
the changeable Duke. Mrs. Whlffen
added to the glad unreality of the
thing with her usual aplomb as Lady
Crofflte; Miss Blanche Stoddard was
lucky in a one-minute part, in which
she didn't have to turn ethical somer
saults, and Miss Cartwright's French
maid was a really clever bit. Mr.
Manners himself was Lord Scarlett,
with herculean self-sacrifice on tap,
and did as well as could be expected.
One thing, the doors shut with a
real bang, in rooms as solidly hand
some as even Henry Miller provided
for his settings, but there is little else
real about "The Crossways."

POLICE ARE NOTIFIED
OF THREE BURGLARIES
Thief Who Has Been Visiting Apart-
ment Houses in the Western Ad
dition Heard From Again.
Miss C. McCarthy reported to the
police yesterday that her room in the
Hotel McAllister, at McAllister street
and Van Ness avenue, had been en
tered between noon and 6 p. m. Mon
day by means of a skeleton key. The
drawers of the bureau had been ran
sacked and jewelry to the value of
$130 stolen. The police say that they
believe the thief to be the same per
son who has been breaking into dif
ferent apartment houses recently in
that district.
Mrs. R. Golding. 2786 Bryant street,
reported that her house had been en
tered on Monday afternoon. The
only thing missing was a lady's gold
watch. An attempt had been made to
break off the lock of a trunk in her
bedroom, and it is supposed that the
burglar was frightened away before
accomplishing his purpose- Entrance
had been effected through a window
in the rear, which the burglar left
open.
Frank Sylvestrie, shoemaker, 325
Mason street, reported that his shop
had been entered through the tran
som about 7 o'clock yesterday morn
ing* and two pairs of shoes stolen. The
thief had left one of his old shoes,
and Sylvestrie recognized it as one
he had repaired about two weeks ago
for a young man who had been em
ployed in an express office near his
shop.

WELL-KNOWN
CALIFORNIAN
DIES AT NICE
From over the seas comes the sad
news of the passing of Mrs. Helen S.
Woolworth of this city.
Her death in Nice on March 30 plunged
the American colony of Paris in gloom.
where with sorrowing hearts they are
keeping vigil with the bereaved daugh
ter. Much as will the mother a-nd
friend be missed by her loved ones, as
sorely will she be mourned by the
American girl students of Paris, to
whom she was long a counselor, guide
and benefactor,
No one knew better than she the
temptations, the sorrows and biting de
privations of many of her compatriots
whom. ambition had lured to an alien
land. To these she stood as a mother,
friend and sister, and bitterly will she
be mourned by them in their hour of
stress.
It is told of her that she held a deep
appreciation of the hardships of poor
students to clothe themselves decently.
and made it a practice to provide bun
dles of clothing regularly for snch as
stood in need. And it is said that even
while traveling over the Continent
these bundles of clothes for the ""girls"
were regularly received.
It is not, however, by the material
aid she gave the struggling artists that
they choose to, remember her, but by
the tender, loving, encouraging words
she held for each "when the burdens
grew heavy and the way long."
Of such is the kingdom of God here
below!
But who will minister to the students
now, so far from home and friends?

THE SAN FRANCISCO REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.
THE Republican League of this city, formed out of the committee
of 250, is already in action. The primary election is in August,
and the time until then must be improved in organization and
preparation. The difficulties in the way are by no means underesti
mated by the league. It will not do to form a league for good gov
ernment and then assume that it will come without effort. Men can
onjure the next administration. They must work for it.
The push has no politics. It enjoys the extraordinary advan
tage of being without political principles or a conscience. At the pri
mary it votes the ticket that promises the most graft. It can thrive
under one administration as well as under another, provided the
system is unchanged. At the primary it will be found probably con
centrating its vote and plumping to get control of the Republican
convention. When bad men conspire, good men must combine. It
is the object of the Republican League to effect such a combination
by offering such a ticket at the primaries as will put the good men
of all parties in combination against the conspiracy of the push of all
parties.
There is a Republican majority in this city, therefore that party
is the most promising instrument for the destruction of the system.
Thousands of Democrats who are shamed by the noisome conditions
here want only the best possible instrument. Such men voted for
President Roosevelt last year because under his leadership the Re
publican party seemed to them the best instrument for the destruction
of a system that had grown like a fungus in national affairs. The
M of the President has amply justified their confidence in him.
They are glad that they voted as" they did. They recognize the ex
istence of an offensive system in San Francisco that makes use of
the municipal administration. They want to destroy it. They want
here the same cleansing spirit that the President has made the mo
tive of the national administration. It is the purpose of the Republi
can League to exhibit a policy, purpose and plan, and select indi
viduals to make them effectual, whereby the municipal administra
tion shall be lifted out of the gutter, set in the light and be made
above reproach and suspicion.
It is a great task? Yes, and the league is the only force in
>ight that offers to undertake it. Look where one will, there is no
movement but this. It is not for personal aggrandizement. It is
probable that the candidates selected will have to be drafted into
the service by this vigilance committee in politics. Personal am
bition cuts no figure in the movement. The men who are enlisted
in it seek only the credit of giving San Francisco the best municipal
government in the Union. We have the best of everything else, why
not that? The achievement is possible, and what is possible is at- ;
tamable. That the ground will be fought inch by inch no one (
doubts. The daughters of the horse leech never let go till they j
have to. The system extends everywhere. It is the municipal
Backer, described by Dr. Jordan as consisting of an appetite and
1 lie power of reproduction. It can be killed only by separating each
sucker from the substance on which it thrives.
What patriotic citizen will refuse to give his time and support
to the league in the high task it has set for itself? One needs no
clairvoyance to read the signs of the far reaching alliances pf the
push in support of the system. Its stake is the control of $18,000,000
to be spent in two years by the city departments for government and
518.000.000 more to be spent on public improvements. It is the
money of the taxpayers. They are the stockholders in this munici
pal corporation. A majority of them want an honest and clean
administration. A minority want the system perpetuated and graft
made profitable. If the well wishing majority fail to act together,
the minority will prevail and graft will become a recognized munici
pal institution.
Let every business man and taxpayer think of himself as a
lolder in this corporation. If it were a private corporation, and
536.000.000 of the stockholders' money was to be spent for a definite
purpose in two years, and it was known that a minority of the
stockholders were in conspiracy to elect a board of directors who
would connive at the dishonest diversion of the money, to the
squandering of it upon favorites and grafters, would the majority
â  1 the stockholders take the risk of dividing so as to let the dishon
est minority gret control? Xo men of sense would do so in their pri
vate business. They would feel that they had but one duty, the
election of an honest directory that would spend the money honestly
and make every dollar produce 100 cents' worth of benefit to the
corporation.
Now that is just what the Republican League proposes. It
wants to get the majority of the stockholders together to plump their
votes, act for the common interest, elect honest directors and spend
the money honestly and legitimately. They do not want to retain
a director in office who is under indictment for a felony, nor other
directors who try to help him evade the law. They want the
whole board to be above suspicion.
This proper course of the league will be supported by the
people regardless of party, as it will be opposed by the push and the
system, regardless of party. Let no man think that the designing
minority will slumber and sleep. It is watchful, alert, skillful. It
will invent new issues to divert and divide the majority. It has
money, ingenuity, energy and no scruples. The fight is now on, and
will be fought to a finish.
AN AMERICAN OPPORTUNITY.
COMMKRCIAL geography, written up to date, could state thi<*
perhaps seldom realized fact: The North Pacific Ocean is
bounded by the United States. Japan and Canada. It conies
clearly into mind when we think of the biÂ£ engirdling circle of main
land and islands, beginning at the Panama canal, which the United
States will control, thence west to Hawaii. Guam ami the Philippines,
then north through the long string of those our new possessions to
Japan's Formosa, then Japan itself, stretching away to the far north
eastward through the Kurile Islands almost to the Aleutians, thence
to Alaska and down the Canada coast to Vancouver, and then our
own coast. Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California, complete
the belting of the ocean which is to bear upon its waters the biggest
development of commerce the world has yet known
The situation has two features of note. .One is that the willirg
receptivity by the Japanese of much of whVt is best and most pro
gressive in Anglo-Saxon ideals and methods should be fostered with
the utmost tatt in our Oriental dealings. The other is that America's
opportunity in the East has been largely increased by the triumph of
Japanese arms, and by Japan's adoption of American principles, such
as the open door and the square deal.
Baron Kaneko, ex-Minister of Agriculture and Commerce in
Japan, says that Japan will be too much exhausted by the war to
develop the immense opportunities for trade in Manchuria and China
proper, but that his people have great advantages with the Chinese
because of racial tie?, similarity of language, tradition, history, etc.,
and so in co-operation with Japan lies our Oriental opportunity.
To that end the first move is to create an Anu-rican-Asiatic bank,
centered in New York, and branched to Newchwang in Manchuria,
Chemulpo in Korea, and the circle of the big commercial cities in
the Orient. Then the railroad from Canton to Hankow, for which
there is an American concession, should be built, for at present there
is no good communication from south to north. It is further urged
that the Chinese Development Company, now owned by Americans,
send mining and railroad engineers and textile experts to China to
study conditions and report. Kaneko points out most forcibly by
figures, comparisons and ensamples the immense opportunity in
Manchuria and China for American capital and enterprise, provided
China be not allowed to be dismembered and the open door policy be
firmly upheld. ________________

A FAMILY OF
"BUTT-INS"
ON Thursday evening Walters
called upon Nell Markham; on
Friday evening Hendricks
came to see her. Now Nell de-
spises Walters to such an ex
tent that she is invariably extremely po
lite to him and likes Hendricks so much
that she barely deigns to treat him with
common courtesy. Her family shares
her opinion of both the men. but their
manner toward them is the reverse.
They shun Walters as they would the
plague and they welcome Hendricka
with whole-hearted cordiality. Inverse
ly Nell should be expected to like this,
but, strangely enough, she complains
that it is only making matters worse.
His sister was with her in the library
when Walters was announced. "Ethel,
won't you come in with me?" she
pleaded. "I can't endure that man's
prattle throughout the entire even
ing."
'This book is too interesting to
leave," was Ethel's reply.
AN EASTER EGG
TRAGEDY.

And wrote upon the shell
Her name and agre. and then described

The egg was shipped to market, and
(Now mark the sequel sad!)
It lingered in the grocery till
Its good was to the bad.
An actor at a one-night stand
A "Hamlet" did essay.
But when he strode across the boards
That egg was hurled his way.
The actor reached the lines, "Oh, my
Offense is rank; it smells "
He never finished, for the "gods"
Let go that egg with yells.
Alas! the lass waits in the lane
The signal of a hand;
She knows not that the shell she sent
Broke ur> a one-night stand.

"I'll buy you a box of chocolate,"
promised Nell.
"Given them up during Lent," was
the response.
"I'll take you to the theater," ca
joled Nell.
"Too high a price," was Ethel's com
ment.
In the hall Nell met her mother.
"Won't you come in for a little while?"
she asked her.
"You know, my dear," said the lady,
"that I do not like to intrude upon your
callers."
As she passed her father's room she
asked him if he would come down a lit
tle while to talk to Walters. Mr. Mark
ham replied instantly that he was go
ing to a political meeting.
"You know that you all think Wal
ters a bore, and that is why none of
you will come," said Nell hotly, and
none of them denied the charge, al
though all resolutely refused to sacri
fice themselves.
Nell spent a dreary evening in the
coldness of Walters' monotonous talk
about himself, his tastes, and his
achievements. She sighed with relief
when he went, although she bade him
a pleasant good-night and expressed
the hope that he would come again.
It was another one af those occasions
when the social white lie spared the
feelings of a thick-headed man.
When Nell went into the parlor the
next evening to greet Hendricks she
found Ethel there before her. Ethel
talked of her school and her dances
and her individual preferences until
she felt that she no longer dared to
ignore the lightning of Nell's eyes.
Just as she went out, Mrs. Markham
passed through the hall and came to
the door. With not the faintest ap
parent remembrance of her remark
concerning intrusion she came in and
talked to Hendricks for an hour about
the time when his mother and she had
attended the same boarding-school.
Before she went Mr. Markham came
in. He had Just returned from another
political meeting, and he was carried
away with enthusiasm. He held the
floor, to his own delight. His wife
slipped out of the room and Nell won
dered if he would not soon follow her
example. But no, he remained until
Hendricks departed. And all the time
he talked politics.
"I did not have one word alone with
him," groaned Nell to herself, as she
turned away.
"I like that chap," said her father,
and wondered why her "It's very evi
dent" was so exceedingly sharp.
UNCLEAN STREETS
MENACE HEALTH
To the Editor of The Call:
In this morning's paper you devote a
few lines to the subject of sprinkling
the streets with salt water, which the
Merchants' Ice and Cold Storage Com
pany proposes to furnish gratuitously.
This is an important subject and one
that has never been adequately treated.
Our streets at the present time are ter
ribly filthy, and necessarily a menace
to the health of the residents of the
town. They should be not only swept
clean, but sprinkled and flushed at
least daily. A nightly flushing, as is
done now in New York and London,
would work marvels in the appearance
of our thoroughfares and would im
prove sanitary conditions wonderfully.
At present the street filth dries and
blows into our faces, into houses and
fruit stands, fish stalls, meat shops and
what not. And then we absorb it, eat
it and drink it. Thorough sprinkling
with any kind of water would help, but
salt water is far superior -UÂ» fresh. In
the first place, it should be very cheap,
an Important desideratum. In the sec
ond place, it keeps a street wet four
times as long as fresh water will be
cause of its salts, which absorb atmos
pheric moisture. It would kill all vege
table growth, whether grass, moss or
bacteria, and, besides, destroy all odors
due to street accumulations. Its good
work would even be continued in the
sewers, as a preventive of putrefaction
and a deodorizing agent.
My work takes me into the dirty
parts of the city, and I often shudder
at the sight of stalls full of fruit and
meat exposed to direct contamination
from the unmentionable filth lying In
the streets, drying and blown about by
every breeze.
Clean sweeping and salt water sprink
ling would go far toward removing un
favorable city conditions, I believe.

MARRIAGES
OF
CONVENIENCE
Dorothy Fen i more
SOME one has written to ask if
I do not think that the European
marriage, which is arranged for
young people by parents or guar-
dians, turns out more happily
than the love marriage which obtains
in our own land.
So much more is involved in the
matter than a mere comparison be
tween young impulse and mature rea
son as guides in affairs matrimonial
that it deserves a longer discussion
than my space will allow. But, as
one who has observed the merits and
evils of both systems at close range,
I am ready to pronounce autocratical
ly in favor of the marriage for love,
which, I believe, promises best for
the evolution of the race and for the
development of the most worthy ideals
of womanhood and home.
The divorce statistics of the United
States would seem, perhaps, to re
fute such an argument. Nowhere else
In the world, except in Japan, is the
divorce rate so hierh.
Yet, according to Professor George
E. Howard of the University of Ne
braska, who has made an exhaustive
study of the subject, never before In
the history of our country has mar
riage been on so elevated a moral, so
cial and economic plane as now; and
the family life in America is the pur
est in the civilizations of the world.
Loose marriage laws and general
lack of education concerning the mar
riage relation are mainly responsible
for the divorce evil that now exists
among us, he declares. And this opin
ion of his is supported by another au
thority. Judge Kavanagh of Chicago,
who has stated that more than 50 per
cent of the 1100 divorces granted in
his city annually take place within
two years after marriage, because of
disillusionment and lack of common
sense. The present unfortunate con
ditions can hardly be considered, then,
as irremediable.
The European marriage of conveni
ence does not exclude the possibility
of love, as many believe who have
viewed it only from afar. European
parents desire that their children shall
be suitably mated; the education that
a girl receives abroad teaches her to
expect that she will love her husband;
and usually a young man falls in love
with his wife, either before or after
the ceremony.
The fact that a money provision has
been made for their life together
tends to create domestic harmony.
But, on the other hand, in coun
tries where marriages of convenience
are the rule both sexes learn early ;
through observation, through litera
ture and through public opinion that
if one does not love one's life partner
it Is In accordance with nature to love
some one else and therefore justifiable.
Thus many young people come to re
gard intrigue as a part of marital ex
perience.
It is unlikely that the marriage of
convenience would thrive iti American
soil if transplanted. Our standards of
womanliness would be enough of
themselves to prevent it from taking
root. As W. C. Brownell has defined
the national feminine ideal, with us a
wife iÂ« a companion first and a wom
an afterward â the exact reverse of
the type developed under the patri
archal marriage system.
Besides, both our men and women
GOT BID OF HER.

THE MUNICIPAL CAMPAIGN.
A Citizen Offers Some Suggestions on the
Situation.
To the Editor of The Call:
There is no thinking man but believes
that if the ideas expressed by the Re
publican League were carried into ef
fect by men of^ caliber of those present
it would be greatly to the Interest of
our city, but it struck me to-day that
the good citizens of the Republican
League forgot that there are also some
good citizens of the Democratic League
who may possibly feel hurt that they
were not invited to assist in furnishing
a better government here. I think the
action of Saturday night Is exactly
what the present administration would
most desire. The Democrats will and
must keep up their organization. The
lukewarm Republicans, who are going
to "wait and see." will howl for the
cunning, cute and crafty Republican
who "made every dollar he possesses
from his profession," and the same
crafty leader, by dropping the present
head of the city administration, will be
able to make such a showing when
back<jd by the police force, the flre de
partment and the sporting element, in
cluding gamblers, poolsellers and sure
thing men of all kinds with all of their
followers, not to speak of the in
trenched army of taxeaters and graft
ers, whose ranks they are so solicitous
of swelling and whose salaries they
pine to increase â with all ot these
forces at their command and with the
two old parties â one already on record
as the cream of the earth, and the
other no doubt to be heard from in a
few days as the entire universal dairy
fighting for supremacy it will not be a
very difficult feat for the Union Labor
party under the guidance of the men
now in control to capture every office In
the coming municipal election. They
can send out eloquent speakers, who
will tell the dear people of the good and
great things done in the last two years
and of other good and great things that
would have been done only for the jeal- |
ous and contemptible conduct of un- j
friendly boards, that prevented them \
from carrying on work as they would |
like to do in the interest of the city and
IB the interest of lahor^unions. The re- I
tallatlon of the workers south of Market j
street mentioned Saturday night would i
have still all the independence which
marks a pioneer civilization. We have
inherited the spirit of our forefathers
who dared to cut out pathsSfor them â¢

"Yankee Doodle" was derived from a
military march played by the Heaeian
troops during the war of the Revolu
tion in America. In studying th*
dances of the Schwalm. Lewalte
struck by the similarity In form and
rhythm of "Yankee Doodle" to the
music of these dances. Last year, At
the "kermess" of the village of Wasen
berg, when "Yankee rjoodle" was
played the young men and girls swung
into a true "Schwaelmer" dance. M
though the music had been corr
for it.
During the war of 177* the chief re
cruiting office for the enlistment <
Hessian hired soldiers was Zlegenhaui
In Kur-Hesse. It therefore seems
probable that the Hessian recruits
from the "Schwalm " who served In
the pay of Great Britain in America
during the Revolutionary War. and
whose military-band instruments con
sisted of bugles, drums and flfes only,
carried over with them the tunÂ».
known to them from childhood, and
played it as a march.

MISSION DOLORES
OPEN TO-MORROW
VftNT ACCESS PERMANENTLY FREE
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
"Why Is it that Mission Dolores is
closed to visitors?" asked an Eastern
visitor of me yesterday. "Having visit
ed every one of your splendid old mis
sions from San IMego to Santa Clara,
I was greatly grieved at being denied
permission to enter the Mission Do
loresâparticularly since its founding is
coincident with the birth of our na
tion," said he with a sigh.
That inquiry has been made before.
In fact, it's been voiced every day for
many years â ever since interest in the
old Missions has been created. t
During the last winter thousands of
tourists have been taken out to the old
adobe sanctuary reared by the good old
friars Palon and Carabon in the long
ago; but a view of the exterior walls,
its long-stilled bells, and its ruined
churchyard were all the visitors were
permitted to see.
"Strange:" say they, "that San Fran
cisco closes to the public the most in
teresting structure within it. And
why?"
â¢Because. " says the pastor, the Rev.
Father v Ãrennan, "vandals have
entered There. Do you see those
statues yonder? Every one within
reach has been mutilated by the pen
knife of the relic hunterâ to whom
nothing that holds historic value is sa
cred."
And herein is a plain statement of
facts â vandalism Is to blame.
Through the unlawful acts of the vi
cious, people legitimately interested in
the old Mission are deprived of the
privileges that should be ours by right
of inheritance. .
Now. for a remedyf-for surely, San
Francisco cannot rest under the im
petuation of apathy toward her proud
est possession by keeping the church
locked forever.
The California Landmarks League is
now preparing a petition to the
Rev. Father Brennan, setting forth
the facts herein stated, offering to the
pastor the services of a caretaker,
whose duty it shall be to guard the
ancient church from assault, with fixed
hours of service to be publicly an
nounced.
Such action has been urged by the
California Promotion Committee and
such public-spirited citizens as desire
that the best San Francisco has to of
fer should be available to her visitors
then let us have the old Mission opened
to an appreciative public, and open at
the earliest possible momentâ for there
are thousands of San Franciscansâ
particularly the wee onesâ who have
never set foot in the sacred old place.
bo full of history and romance, and
only because they couldn't.
Fancy New York, Boston, PhHadel
phia, or nearer homeâ take Los An
geles, or Santa Barbara, for instance
permitting so valuable an asset to ero
unnoticed and unsung.
It is a civir and a social sin! â and it
is hoped that the Rev. Father Brennan
will accede to the request of the Land
marks League, petitioning through its
president. Congressman Joseph R.
Knowiand.
To such *â¢ have been longing for a
visit to the church, with its recently
restored altarsâ restored, by the way,
in a sane and artistic manner' â the
doors will be open to-morrow for the
Holy Thursday devotions, and all who
enter with reverence and respect will
be welcomed.
And a beautiful sight will greet the
eye, as a wilderness of blossoms will
be banked upon the dull gold altar,
with sconces of brass glittering in the
light of a thousand candles. Inoense
will fill the sanotuary, as hundreds of
worshipers kneel before the ancient
tabernacle, therein rests the holy
eucharist.
This is the service of Holy Thursday,
in commemoration of the last supper,
and one of the solemnest services in
the Catholic ritual.
Three years have passed since thÂ«
movement began in the north toward
saving the Old Missions. At that time
Mice Nora Fennell. born and reared
within the shadows of Mission Dolores
(St. Francis de Assisi) took up the task
of raising money for the purpose of
restoring the interior of the old church
to its original state. Succeeding ad
mirably as to finances, she gave the
work of saving the tottering altars to
the Mahoney Brothers, who performed
their service in such manner that a
century hence will see the altars safely
anchored to the adobe walls.
Then the white%vaÃhed walls were
liberally "water-washed," and lying
below the surface were found the orig
inal trarerie? of the Indian neophytes.
With rare skill these have been re
vived.
Besidw the statues in the sanctuary,
many of which are marvelously
carved and colored, and none under
a century old, have been carefully re
paired by C. E. Fennell, who for two
years has devoted his leisure hours to
this labor of love â a phase of patriot
ism that doesn't afflict many of us
children here below.
But such results!â Ah! There's the
reward for these good peopla who
havp done so much for Mission Do
lores.
Then let us have it open, that the
world may see what we of the West

PADRES IN 1776.
may claim in the way of honorable
and ancient monuments.
The Mission Dolores is the proud
est possession in the big city by the
Golden Gate. Then let us talk about
It. bring our children to see it, tell
them its tragic and romantic story,
and bring our visitors to stand within
its sacred shadow.
Walk with them in its quiet church
yard, never so beautiful as now, with
its graves o'errun with blue-eyed peri
winkle, Castillan roses caressing the
tombs long since tenantless. pink
cheeked mallows bending o'er the hid
den pathways, and the weeping wil
lows sweeping the graves of the for
gotten. Oh, It was beautiful yester
day In that silent city of the dead â so
glad in its silence, with the blooms of
nature garlanding each sepulcher. rich
and poor alike.
When you go out to see the old
church, walk for a while in the old
cemetery'- It is in a sorry state of
ruin now, but God hasn't forgotten
it â for the flowers bloom on and on.
I doubt if in England, noted tor pic
turesque churchyards, If one more
beautiful than this can be seen.
See it before the blooms of spring

ESCAPE FROM
DETENTION SHED
Three Japanese Being Held
for Deportation Climb
Through Hole in the Eoof
, L
TWO AXE KECAPTUKED
Missing One's Skin Covered
With Tattoo Work and He
Will Probably Be Caught
Three Japanese who stowed away
in Japan on the liner Manchuria and
were being held in the detention shed
at the Pacific Mail wharf awaiting de
poration- escaped on Monday night.
Two of them tumbled from the raft
ers back to captivity when a revolver
exploded underneath their hiding
place. The third is still missing and
is thought to ha^e made his escape
by walking boldly down the main
stairway when Head ' Watchman
Blackburn, who was on duty, was not
looking. The missing man is elabor
ately tattooed with dragons and Ori
ental gods and his recapture before
long is deemed a certainty.
The men were "missed, at 11:80
p. m., when Night Watchman W.
Wassley ofthe Pacific Mail Company
checked up his charges. The alarm
was sounded and a vigilant search
failed to reveal any trace of the
runaways until Watchman Joe Hays
looked into a locker, little more than
a foot square and noticed that a board
had been removed at the top. Break
ing their way through the watchmen
found themselves among the rafters
and in an inky darkness.
Hays fired a shot through the roof
and before the noise of the explosion
had ceased to echo two cobweb-cov
ered Japanese fell at the feet of the
searchers, begging for quarter and be
seeching that they be returned alive
to their honorable prison.
All of yesterday the hunt for the
third man continued in vain. The
search showed, however, that he did
not make his escape by the roof route,
but must have passed out through the
main door, where Watchman Black
burn of the Chinese Bureau was on
guard.
The locker, through the roof of
which the Japanese reached the raft
ers, is hardly large enough to accom
odate a hat, and in making their es
cape that way the stowaways must
have Derformed a feat of contortion
that an anatomist would pronounce
impossible.
The Asiatics in the detention shed
were counted nineteen times last night
and got little sleep between rollcalls,
but they were all there this morning.

The "Opera Sale** of
WEBER PIANOS
Meets With Remarkable Success
MONDAY was begun the most important annual event in San Francisco's re-
tail piano trade â the special sale of upward of twenty Weber Pianof used by
the Metropolitan Opera Company artists. The public's response to this sale
has been prompt and enthusiastic ; in fact, it has exceeded all anticipations. At
the time of this writing the pianos still remaining on sale are those used by the fol-
lowing members of the Conried Metropolitan Opera Company during the season just
concluded:
Caruso Nordica FremsUd
Scotti De Macchi Louise Homer
Journet Poehlman Dippel
Jacoby Goritz Talma
Paula Ralph
The official selection of the Weber Piano for exclusive use by the Metropolitan
Opera Company and the fact that these instruments were individually chosen by such
great artists are proofs of the intrinsic excellence of each and every piano included in
this offering. The importance of this sale Is readily appreciated when it is- consid-
ered that although the pianos are practically new and have, in addition, the interest of
distinguished associations, they are all offered at
SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN PRICE
Each piano is ticketed with the name of the opera artist who has had it in his or
her apartments during this, the most successful opera season on record in San Fran-
cisco, together with the New York City price of the instrument, at which we regularly
sell it, and its present sale price. All the pianos here offered are in perfect order, and
the complete guarantee of the manufacturers and ourselves covers each purchase.
Both Grands and Uprights are included, representative of the latest style in cases
and the most perfect workmanship that the Weber factory in its fifty-three years' his-
tory has produced.
Time payments accepted. Other pianos taken in exchange.

CRUZADOS, A PROHIBITIVE CHOICE,
FINISHES NOSE BEFORE SAD SAM
Colors of the Baldwin
Stable Becoming
Familiar.
Favorites Capture All
but One Event at
Oakland.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Coming like a Rip Van Winkle awak
rninp. the Mark with red maltese cross
colors of "Ltw.ky" Baldwin are again
as familiar with rat fgrners at Oakland
as they wrwn. with turf patrons a decade
liark. El Dlnero took the two-year-old
rday, and Cruzados, the fly
ing son of En Xorfolk, placed
the five-furlong handicap to the credit
: th<- master of Santa Anita ranch.
Oruzadns it was thought would
Rpreade&gle the other three starters,
fven though shouldering 122 pounds.
The ring held him a 1 to 3 chance, and
after getting away poorly Bullman set
the bay horse down a nose in advance
of Sad Sam at the wire. Iredeus ran
third. Ac the track was Blow the time,
I.OIV makes a fÂ«ist performance.
Favorites nearly scored a sweep, cap-
X al! but one event. Baker, the
â¢utsider to win, ran in ahead of
Ppondoolix in the second.
El Dinero left the maiden two-year
ass= with flying colors in the three
furlong scramble. A.7 to 10 favorite
around poet time, with Bullman up, the
Baldwin colt won very easily. Cazazza,
thf runner-up, grew wobbly the last
fifty yards. losing the place to Com
modore Eaj=tland by a nf-ck. Pal ran a
poor race.
There was nothing whatever to rec
ommend the seven furlong selling: af
fair, the best ones being scratched.
Ppondoolix finally closed favorite over
Gallant Cassie. the latter filly's price
receding Just before post call. Spon
doollx looked all over a winner for
two-thirds of the journey, then he be
gan to wilt under Fountain- Baker,
piloted by Frank Sullivan, closed with
a rush, taking the purse without much
effort. The winner's odds were played
from 15 down to 7. Gallant Cassie
swerved and was left.
Graham landed the 6 t0 % 5 favorite
Emma Reubold first for the six furlong
selling number. the mare had noth-
Reubold Hi-m for thÂ«- mx furlon
numbf-i. The mare had noth
ing much to beat,' and soon showing in
front won ridden out from Yellowstone
and Tannhauser. Billy Taylor retired
early, after displaying some speed.
Many thought Anvil received th
nomination for the mile and a six
teenth selling run. Possibly the geld
ing did, but he had a most modest
cluster of cheap , ones to subdue a
that. At any rate, the smart set
would have nothing but Anvil, and,
starting a 2 to 1 favorite, he was never
headed. Byronerdale, the opening fa
vorite, finished third, half a length be
hind Dusty Miller. Trapsetter made a
dellsrhtful showing.
V/hile High Chancellor was supposed
to be strictly a fast track horse, plenty
of money found its way into the books
on his chances in the speculating done
on the closing mile purse event. Knapp
rode him with the skill of a cow
puncher, finishing fourth. Billy Cahill's
Andrew Mack, the 7 to 10 favorite,
came home under reefed sails, four
lengths in advance of Soufriere and
Briarthorpe.

E. J. Baldwin was present to see his
favorite sprinter, Cruzados, win the
handicap.

He was exhausted and suffering

A world's baseball record went
glimmering on the Oakland field yes
terday afternoon when San Francisco
and Oakland struggled and fought for
sixteen tireless Innings without scor
ing a run. Not a fluke play nor a bit
of luck came to the rescue of either
team during the progress of the
memorable game, which goes to make
tne contest even more remarkable.
mere have been more sensational
games played on many diamonds, but
never has such a remarkable struggle
taken place. The game was devoid of
startling play outside of the work of
the pitchers. It is safe to say, how
ever, that no two box artists ever par
ticipated in such an exhibition as
\Yhalen and Schmrdt starred in yes
terday.
Both men displayed courage, cun
"i 1 / 1 * an <i nerve that were almost impos
sible to conceive. They were pitch
ing as hard and as desperately and
were as effective when the game was
called at the end of the sixteenth
Inning as when they commenced their
days labor. Neither man showed the
slightest sign of weakness or fatigue
during the remarkable struggle.
Although the day was bleak and
cold, the players on each side dis
played wonderful fastness. Only three
errors were committed while the game
was in progress. One of those was
made by Francks, while Gochnauer
and Spencer were each responsible for
one.
It is doubtful whether the fans will
ever have a chance of witnessing an
other such diamond struggle, yet there
were only about 200 "people in attend
ance. As the innings rolled by the
spectators sat glued to their places,
each intent on watching every play
and cheering their favorites when they
performed any feat worthy of notice.
But few startling plays were made.
Devereaux, Francks and Gochnauer
executed all the flashy bits of field
ing.
The work of Whalen was marvel
ous. He pitched the entire sixteen
innings without allowing a single base
on balls or hitting one , batsman. Only
nine of the Oaklanders reached first
base and four of these were caught,
leaving but five to die on the sacks.
Schmidt walked four men, hit one
and allowed eight base hits. Twelve
of the Seals perished on the sacks.
They had the bases full in the tenth
spasm when Walters poked a ground
ed to Francks and was thrown out at
first. This was the nearest either side
came to scoring a run.
San Francisco also had men on sec
ond and third in the sixteenth iniflng.
Captain Parke Wilson came to the
bat with two out. He fouled off sev
eral balls and was trying his utmost to
make a hit, but Schmidt finally let
loose a big drop and Wilson fanned.
Umpire Ferine then called the game
on account of darkness.
Not a man stole a base during the
progress of the memorable game.
Both McMurray and Shea threw to
bases in remarkable style. Each
pitcher tore off two hits, while the
best hitters on the rival teams were
unable to connect safely at all. Wal
ters had seven chances with the club
and could not come through once.

BEEF INQUIRY
WITNESS FLEES
CHICAGO. April 18.â A sensation
was caused among Federal officials in
the investigation of the alleged "beef
trust" to-day, when it developed that
a much-sought-for witness had left
Chicago. The witness is Carl Levi,
head of the Berthold & Levl Sausage
Casing Company of this city. A serv
ant at the home of Levi said that he
left Chicago more than a week ago,
and that a short time later his wife
followed. No Information is given as
to their destination.

NO MORE GOES
FOR A WHILE
Not for several months will the
"amateurs" get busy at Woodward's
Pavilion; not till the present Grand
Jury is dissolved. Coming Jimmy
Britts and Nelsons must saw wood for
a while or fight for real medals that
cannot be exchanged at the door for
filthy lucre.
Foreman Andrews is not making a
Lje Blanche swing at a popular sport,
but he Is certain that he has scented
graft in the game. When he starts
graft has to take the count. Legiti
mate clubs can pull off as many shows
as they like, but they must comply
with the law to the letter. Foreman
Andrews is from Missouri strictly in
regard to the alleged amateurs.
But the tip is out that no more mix
ups with 'amateurs" will be sched
uled until the dissolution of the Grand
Jury. "Rough House" McDonald will
engage in the pleasant recreation of
practing ping-pong until then, and
Sam Berger will dally a while with the
croquet mallet.
Alex Greggains said last night:
"They can't stop a legitimate club.
May be the San Francisco Club will
pull off a* show next month, may be
not, I dunno. What fell, anyhow."
This last sentence expresses just
about what the fight fans say and
think. The game is not menaced in
any way. But the Grand Jury insists
that everything must be on the square
to the smallest item.
It was found in the investigation of
the Hayes Vallej Club that several of
the contestants had not been exam
ined by a physician, as required by
law. A certificate was handed to the
Chief of Police to the effect that this
requirement had been carried out. But
on investigation it was admitted that
several of the boys had not been ex
amined-
Morris Levy declared Sunday that he
would put on real, bona-flde. 18-karat
amateur shows. He had a legitimate
club, and declined to be buffaloed, he
asserted. But now the tip comes that
Morris, too. will lay low.
"What fell, anyhow," as Mr. Greg
gains says.
The Grand Jury has not made any
investigation of the affairs of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Light Com
pany. Foreman Andrews declared last
night that the sweeping statements
made by Henry Sessions have not been
acted upon by the Grand Jury, and
probably will not, unless something
substantial is advanced to warrant
an investigation.
CHARLEY MITCHELL. WILL.
STAND BY AGREEMENT
White's Manager Still Has Hopes
That Coffroth W ill Pull Off
the Fight.
Charley Mitchell, manager of Jabea
White, called upon Manager Coffroth
of the Yosemite Club last night and
asked him what he was going to do
about the proposed Britt-Whlte bat
tle, which is scheduled to take place
this month. "Charley," said Coffroth,
"you have signed to box before my
club on April 26. If I do not pull off
the contest on that date, you are
through with me."
Before their meeting ended Coff
roth gave Mitchell assurance that he
would give him a definite answer on
Friday night, or possibly to-night, and
let him know just what he Intends to
do. Coffroth says he has plans in
view which he wants to think over.
He has not given up hope of getting
the permit.
Mitchell says he has a contract with
the Yosemite Club and he intends to
keep it. He said: "I will fill my part
of the contract and perhaps go a lit
tle further if I am assured Coffroth
can bring Brltt and White together.
He has been under a big expense in
making this match and has treated
our party very failrly. lam not dis
couraged and think Britt and Whits
will eventually come together. I have
been supervising White's training
and he is going along just as if noth
ing was in the way and will be ready
when called upon to box."

PASSENGERS FOR THE ORIENT.
Liner Sails for Far East With Heavy Cargo of Contraband
The Pacific Mall Company's big liner
Manchuria, Captain J. W. Saunders,
mailed yesterday for the Orient, carry
ing the largest number of cabin pas
senger? that has left port on a Pacific
Mail steamship since the days of the
ie-wheelers. Her cabins were
ed and every hold was Jammed to
capacity with freight. The car
go consists largely of contraband for
Japan and includes machinery, struc
tural steel and gun-carr^gres. Most of
ructural steel is the product of a
linn and will be used in replacing
em the Manchurian railway the bridges
sacrificed through the necessities of
The mess beef, if there is no Rus
interference with the Manchuria
â¢n here and Japan, will furnish
for the little brown soldiers and
bailors.
The Manchuria was half an hour late
;n leaving the wharf owing to the tardy
arrlvaJ of the office mail. As she left
her berth the liner's bow scraped the
loof of the wharf shed, tearing to
piece? a coaJ chute, causing a Niagara
( I shingles to clatter into the bay and
stampeding a large crowd gathered to
bid departing friends good-by. The
damage was slight, and such harm as
one was unavoidable, as the liner
. revented by a bank of mud from
*v. inging clear.
Among the passengers on the Man
< huria was Shalnm Bi!vprstone, reoent
;>â  elevated from the assistant secre-
taryship of the Occidental an-d Oriental
nship Company to the position of
agent at Hongkong for the Pacific Mail,
< >cci<3ental and Oriental and Toyo Kisen
Kaisha steamships. Silverstone was
accompanied by his wife and three chil
dren. The new agent takes to his post
in the Orient the good wishes of his
former associates and the regard of a
large number of friends, who assembled
in a smail army on the wharf to bid
him good-by and wish him good luck
in his new sphere.
The passengers included army and
navy officers, diplomats, business men
and travelers for pleasure â 205 of them
a .together. W. W. Rockhill. the new
Minister to China, and H. B. Miller, the
ml General to Japan, are on
the Manchuria bound for their new

â *
Chamber of Commerce Asked
by Promotion Committee 1
to Make Portland Trip
When J. L. Bristow, commissioner
for President Roosevelt and the War
Department to ascertain facts about
the Panama railroad and steamship j
line as concerning commerce on the :
Pacific Coast, was in this city he for- j
mulated a series of questions to be
sent out to merchants and mercantile !
houses. The questions were asked to â ,
obtain data of a reliable sort regard
ing the present movement of tonnage
by way of the isthmus. Yesterday a
special committee of the Chamber of
Commerce submitted a report to the
trustees of the chamber, in which the
substance of the replies was embodied .
with some other matter that the ,
chamber has had prepared.
Since Mr. Bristow was in this city
the War Department has seemingly
decided on Its course of action con
cerning the Panama lines, as the dis
patches from Washington are to the
effect that the Panama road will be
double-tracked and that the steamship
service will be augumented. The re
port of the special committee of the j
Chamber of Commerce still has local |
interest, however. It is very long and
statistical. After the trustees have
had time to read and digest the mat
ter it will be published.
The chamber yesterday held a quar
terly meeting and received reports
from William M. Bunker, the represen
tative of the chamber at Washington,
D. C, and also an invitation to the
members of the chamber to be mem
bers of the California Promotion Com
mittee's excursion to Portland to at
tend the Lewis and Clark Exposition.
A day has been set by the manage
ment to be known as California Pro
motion Committee day, vrhen a recep
tion will be held. A special excursion
will be made to The Dalles, for which
a steamboat has been engaged. The
members of the chamber will be noti
fied personally of the excursion. â

STOCK MARKET.
Nothing New of Importance on the
Local Exchanges.
Business continued very dull on the Stock
and Bond Exchange, and aside from a further
decline in Hawaiian Commercial to $86 there
were no changes worthy of note.
The Comstock mining shares were not as
active as of late, and quotations remained
about as before. The Tonopahs were active
with large eales of North Star at lower and
Jim Butler at higher prices.
The Tonopah Mining Exchange has amended
its by-laws so that hereafter all stocks sold
on the day that transfer books are closed will
be sold ex-dividend, and not as heretofore.
The Bullion Mining Company has levied an
assessment of 5 cents.
The California Stock and Oil Exchange will
be oloeed on April 21 (Good Friday).
The Pacific Coast Borax Company will pay a
regular monthly dividend of $1 per share on
April 29.
The Fireman's Fund Insurance Company has
declared a regular quarterly dividend of $3 per
chare, payable April 19.

The heavy selling in Union Pacific during
the larger part of the day was started by the
early break in Northern 6eourttiÂ«s. The sym
pathetic move In Union Pacific unsettled the
whole market and some sharp declines were
scored London became panic stricken on
Americans and helped the selling movement
materially. Some exceptions to the list were
Eteele, Smelters. Lead, - Fuel &cd Copper. The
strength in Steel with the steady accumula
tion In evidence was caused by the report
that eventually all of the preferred stock
would be retired by refunding five per cent
bonds. This seem/ quite possible.
Hop* In Xew York.
Mail advices from New York say of Hops:
"The market is dull. On* dealer has issued
a circular letter to the brewery trade offering
to sell choice Pacific â  Hop* for May shipment
at 28c New York. . This offer operated against
the market, having a tendency to hold buyer*
in dieck. dealers generally reporting business
with brewer* at flat. Latest reports from the
coast state that crop is making a good start
and that in California it is unusually well
advanced. The Increase In acreage on the

increase in the- acreage in New York State Is
placed at 5 to 10 per cent, the Continent about

The heavy winter rains and the sever* frosts
at the close of March injured deciduous fruits
in soon* sections, but it is believed that the '
damage will prove slight and that most varie
ties will yield large crops. Apricots and pears
are reported light in many places and peaches
have been somewhat Injured by blight in the
Kan Joaquln- Valley. The first box of cherries!
was chipped from VaeavlUe on the 7th. some I

SACRAMENTO VALLET^-Tbe weather dur
ir.g the wÂ«.-ek was warm and clear until Satur
day, when It' became cooler and cloudy, with
quite' heavy rain in all sections. The rain
wav generally beneficial and. probably caused
lit: !â¢ If .any damage .to cherries and straw
berries, which are now rapidly maturing. All
varieties of. deciduous fruitg are well advanced
er.d give indications of large yields with
the exception of pears; this crop will be lighter
than last season's. Grain continues in good
condition in most places, but on some of the
bottom lands it is foul with â  weeds. Pros
pects are excellent for large yields of wheat,
cats, barley and hay. .Alfalfa harvest is pro
gressing satisfactorily. Green feed Is abundant
&cd '>ck is doing well. Hops are in good

plentiful and rtock Is in good condition. Hay
ing is In progress in some places. Deciduous"
fruits In portions of the northern district*
were considerably injured by rain and frost* i
during March, but the present outlook is good
for excellent crops of mo*t varieties in all
sections. The first cherries of ' the season
were shipped East from Vacaville on the 7th

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 18.â Speculators long of
stocks showed a great deal of -.trepidation to
day, which closed a free unloading and rather
severe inroad on prices. The news of the
day contained nothing: to indicate an , impair
ment of actual value, but the action of the
markÂ«t Itself served to create distrust and
uncertainty over the many stories at bril
liant financial projects which have been' the
principal motive for - the buying of stocks
up to the recent high level of prices. The
Incident having the most direct Influence was
-the sudden and violent break of Northern
Securities within the first ten minutes, of
trading on the curb market. The first â  few
Bales of the stock were at a fraction higher
than last night, un to 181, but after that
there seemed absolutely no demand and the
price was offered down precipitately sixteen
points without â¢ finding buyers. - This news
quickly reached the floor of the Stock Ex
change and induced a slump in the price of
Union Pacific and St. Paul. The quick re
covery of ten or twelve points in Northern
Securities was reported almost immediately.
The feverish action left sentiment very much
unsettled and in the absence of actual news
to explain the break there was a disposition
to attribute it to the practical operating dif
ficulties In the curb market, where- facilities"
are restricted both â  in the" matter ' of supply
and lof the conveniences of the buying, thus
leaving- the : market narrow and unrepresent
ative for any stock of such an enormous
volume as that of the Northern Securities
Company. But the volume of the offerings
of the related stocks on the exchange de
prived '. this explanation -of Its : force. There
was more plausibility in the contention that
on the eve of the surrender of Northern Se
curities share certificates to be exchanged for
Northern Pacific and \ Great Northern stock,
there developed a certain apprehension that
with the return to the market cf . a great
floating supply of these constituent stocks
it would be found difficult to keep up their
prices to a level to which they have recently
sold. The tie-up in the Northern Securities
Company ha left the actual floating supply
of Great Northern and Northern Pacific very
â mall, making It easy to mark up the price
to figures more than double those prevailing
before the formation of the securities com
pany The reports current to account for these
prices, and which 'have been entirely without
sanction of official authority, have all indi
cated financial readjustment rather (than any
actual change In the equities of the. com
panies. The supposed plan to Incorporate Great
Northern's Iron holdings into a. separate com
pany Is an example. The market position of
Union Pacific also has been the subject of
growing suspicion. The enormous ; borrowing
demand for this stock, which has attracted
marked attention, has been generally attributed
to the desire for its use for proxies at the
meeting to- authorize the $100,000,000 preferred
stock Increase., ThÂ» books are to close for
thin meeting to-morrow and there seemed a
eudden realization that this might mean the
I release to the market of a very large amount
of this borrowed stock. There: was some
dread entertained even that this enormous
borrowing of stock might represent liquidat
ing saleÂ» by Insiders who were borrowing for
delivery to disguise the source. of the 'selling.
In fact there was a very general disposition
to suspect the speculative conditions of the
market as a whole.- Pools which have oper
ated In various stocks unloaded to a large.
extent. ThÂ« supposition : that there was re
trenchment by selling in the stock market
against the necessities â of the- wheat deal'alvo
continued in force. The , Weather Bureau's
weekly crop report relieved seme apprehen
sion ' of damage from cold weather. â¢ Money
continued MÂ«y. A survey of the- day's nÂ»t
changes, however, reveals a more decided set
back in nrlo's than has occurred in many
I week*. The closing tone was the weakest of
[ the day and prices wÂ»r*,at about the lowest.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetable*
High-grade table Burbanks from Oregon are
weak, the previous high prices having checked
1 the demand, while the cheaper sorts from
other growing- districts are moving freely.
New Potatoes are Improving in quality and the
, best lots clean up readily from day to day.
I Onions were <iuiet yesterday, pending the un
loading of the 3300 crates brought from Aus
tralia by the steamer Ventura. There were
I no new arrivals from Oregon.
Changes in mlacellaneous vegetables were
â light. String and Wax Beans werÂ« lowÂ«r
under increased supplies and quotations for

supply, but liberal purchasing for canning

thing except small Broilers, which continued
to arrive freely from the Petaluma region.

There was no change in any description

the latter showed an increase. Dealers all
I over the street continued disposed to let the
1 markets stay where they a*e for the present,
i as at current quotations the goods can be
: easily moved, and they fear that any attempt
! to advance prices will end In checking th^ dp
; mand. There was an attempt to get up an-
I other car of Butter for the Boat, but it was
abandoned.

RIGHTWAY SHOE HOUSE HAS
BEEN SOLD TO ROSEXTHALS >
\rÂ« 'Owners Will Conduct Store in
Conjunction With the One on
Ream: Street,
The Rightway Shoe Company's
business in the Phelan buildine has
been sold to Rosenthal's (Incorporat
ed). The store will retain the name
of the Rightwa'- Shoe Company and
will be run in conjunction with Ro
benihal's present store at 113 Kearny
street.
ThÂ« Rightway was familiarly
known as the employes' shoe house,
as the clerks and workmen of the
house were owners as well as 'em
ployes.
The deal has been on foot for some
time and matters were completed a
day or so ago. It is the intention of
the new management to retain the
present force of the Rightway and
put in a new stock of goods.
I. L. Rosenthal, president of the
firm, was reticent as to what the pur
chase price was, desiring to wait until
several matters had been adjusted.
Xotlce to/ Mariners.
Captain William G. Goodman of the bark
Emily F. Whitney has asked the hydrograph c
office to warn master* of vessels bouni to
Makawelt from the eastward to keep at least
one mile off the land when abreast of the
-mill chimney and to continue that distance
off shore until they are past it one and a halt
mile* to the westward. This warning â¢â¢
necessary because of the existence of a- ledge
which projects three-quarters of a mile from
the: land. This ledce once was marked by a
â mall spar buoy, but that guide Is not now
in place and will not be renewed.

WORKS BOARD
WANTS LAWYER
The Board of Public Works is pre
paring a supplementary estimate of
birdget expenses for the next fiscal year
to be presented to the Board of Super
visors for its consideration in a day or
two. The estimate will contain a re
quest for the appointment of an attor
ney to conduct its legal affairs. John
B. Gartland. a clerk in the department,
who has been attending to the legal
business of the board for several years,
yesterday requested the board to relieve
him from that portion of his multifa
rious duties.
Gartland -says he has come to be in
the nature of a bureau of Information
for the Department of Works, and the
legal business has increased to such an
extent that he is unable to stand the
strain. Gartland says that there are
now fourteen cases pending in the Su
preme, Superior and Justices' courts,
in which former and present Commis
sioners of Works are defendants. The
board agrees with Gartland that an at
torney should devote his entire time to
its legal affairs, and to that end will
ask that funds be provided for the em
ployment of an attorney. The salary
will be anywhere from $150 to $250 per
monthâ that is, if the Supervisors ac
quiesce. The City Attorney in the legal
adviser of all city departments, but
owing to pressure of other business is
unable to devote much time to the
Board of Works.
The City Engineer's office is confront
ed with a serious difficulty owing to the
fact that several of the assistant en
gineers have resigned their positions to
accept more lucrative employment.
During the last month no less than five
such employes have severed their con
nection with the department, and the
force is badly crippled as a result.
Those who have left or are about to
leave are Surveyors Pidge and Her
mann, Engineers Price and Holcomb
and Draughtsman Burrage, and more
are to follow. The force at present is
unable to handle the regular office
work, and unless relief is provided by
the Board of Supervisors in the next
budget the preliminary work under the
bond Issue cannot be accomplished. The
matter will be considered at to-day's
meeting of the Board of Works.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1905
BEGINS TO FIX
BUDGET ITEMS
The budget estimates of the Sheriff,
Treasurer, Assessor, Recorder and Tax
Collector for the coming fiscal year
were gone over by the Finance Com
mittee of the Supervisors yesterday,
and it was tacitly agreed to allow the
appropriations asked for.
Sheriff Curtis' request was $600 higher
than last year, the extra amount being
for the purchase of three sand wagons.
The total of the Sheriff's item for sala
ries, subsistence of prisoners and main
tenance of jails is $138,220. He also
wanted $1275 to repair jail No. 1 and
$8050 to repair Jails Nos. 2 and 3. The
committee cut down the amount for
Jail repairs to $8500 at the Sheriff's own
request. The other figures were allowed
to stand.
The committee allowed the Assessor
$48,200 for charter salaries, $40,000 for
salaries of extra clerks, $6000 for addi
tional extra clerks and $1000 for ex
penses of field deputies.
Treasurer McDougald wanted $18,700
in all, including $2400 for two additional
clerks and $500 for incidental expenses
and for transportation of funds to Sac
ramento. The matter of one of the ad
ditional clerks was taken under advise
ment, but the other Items were allowed.
Recorder Godchaux asks for $30,000
for copyists, against $27,000 for last
year, and for $20,100 for other salaries,
including $6000 for four extra deputies
and $1200 for a machinist. He also
wants $3800 for book typewriting ma
chines and $750 for stamps. The com
mittee allowed $18,900 for salaries and
$28,000 for copyists. The item of the
typewriting machines was passed tem
porarily.
Tax Collector Smith asked for $68,800
for salaries, including $1500 for a
stenographer, which latter item, how
ever, was withdrawn. For incidentals
he wants $4590, but this item was cut
to some extent.
It is the Intention of the committee to
provide specifically for each item of
expense, so as to preserve the urgent
necessity fund Intact as far as possible.
The committee will resume considera
tion of the budget this afternoon,
when the estimates of the Police and
Fire Commissioners will be taken up.
On Thursday afternoon the estimates
of the Justices' clerk and of the Civil
Service, Health and Elections Com
missions will be gone over, and on
Friday afternoon those of the Park
Commission and Board of Public
Works.

Theaters Dismiss Suite.
In view of Judgre Seawell's decision
enjoining the police from closing the
Baldwin Theater, the suits instituted
by the Unique. Novelty and Midway
theaters have been dismissed, as the
ruling of the court regarding the right
of the first named theater to operate
applies to all. If any of these theater.s
are running in violation of the fire
ordinance the city has but one remedy
and that is to proceed against the pro
prietors in the criminal cpurts.

CALL HARRISON
AS AN EXPERT
William Greer Harrison, president of
the Olympic Club, was called as a
witness for the defense at the trial of
Joseph Smith, the aged contractor
charged with the murder of Joseph E.
McGowan at 2969 Mission street on No
vember 26. In answer to a question by
Attorney Ach, based upon the blow the
defendant received on the chin from
McGowan, followed by the- defendant's
falling and cutting his forehead on a
marble slab, he expressed the opinion
that it would have put the defendant
in a dazed condition so that he might
not know what he was doing for
some minutes later.
"I remember the case of Harry
Chester," continued Harrison. "He was
engaged in a four-round bout at the
Olympic Club about a year ago. In
the first round he was knocked down
by a blow on the chin, but got on his
feet before the count of ten. He fought
out that round and the three succeed
ing rounds and was awarded the
Dout. Some minutes later, when in the
dressing-room, he shook himself, and
looking round, asked when the bout
was to begin. He had fought auto
matically after receiving the blow on
the chin."
Harrison was cross-examined by Dis
trict Attorney Byington, who asked a
number of questions hypothetical and
otherwise, but Harrison steered clear of
contradicting himself, explaining that
he merely expressed an opinion.
The defendant took the stand and.
in answer to questions, said he had
lost all recollection of what happened
after receiving the blow on the chin.
He had no hatred against Joseph Mc-
Gowan and there was no reason why
he should have killed the young man.
He said he had been a heavy drinker
since the death of his wife, two years
ago, and had several drinks of brandy
on the morning of November 26 prior
to the murder. He was troubled with
insomnia and drank to make him sleep.
He contradicted James Beatty in sev
eral important C tails. Several of the
Jurors took a hand in questioning him
as to his drinking habits. He was un
der cross-examination when court ad
journed.
Wants Vicious Dog Suppressed.
Russell Kirby, a boy 11 years of
age, living with his parents at 212Â«Â£
Grove street, obtained a warrant from
Police Judge Cabaniss yesterday for
the arrest of "Jane Doe" Curtis, 311
Van Ness avenue, on a charge of al
lowing a dog to run at large. The
dog is a big and vicious one and bit
the boy's hand badly last Sunday. Po
liceman W. T. Hooper says he has re
ceived several complaints from parents
about the same canine biting their
children and twice it attacked him.
Alleged Gambler Arrested.
James Crichton, 30 years of age,
son of a contractor, residing at 109
Baker street, was arrested yesterday
by order of Captain Gleeson on sus
picion of making a poolbook on the
races. He was charged at the Stan
yan-street station with vagrancy and
was highly indignant over his arrest.

SET CALENDARS
OF NEW COURTS
Appellate Judges Decide to
Begin Work of Hearing
Cases Early Next Month
"JOHXSOX MA DE A CLERK
General Consultation for
Consideration of Rules
Is Held by the Jurists
The three Appellate Courts of Cali
fornia created by the people at the
election of last November and filled,
with judicial incumbents by appoint
ment of the Governor early this
month will take up their work in the
various districts in May. The Appel
late Court of the First District, in
which are San Francisco and Alameda
counties, will be the first to begin the
holding of sessions.
The Supreme Court Commission, all
of whose members have been appoint
ed to the new courts, has probably
passed out of existence for good. The
Commissioners upon receiving their
appointments as Appellate Judges
tendered their resignations to Chief
Justice Beatty of the Supreme Court,
the power that appointed them. The
terms of the Commissioners would not
have expired before May 12 and the
Supreme Court has power to appoint
a new lot. but it is quite improbable
that it will do so. The commission
had but two officers, a secretary and
an assistant secretary and stenogra
pher. The former has been taken
caije of by one of the new courts and
the other will probably be. They
were both appointed by the Supreme
Court.
Appellate Judges R. C. Harrison. J.
A. Cooper and Samuel P. Hall, who
occupy the bench of the First District
Appellate Court, met yesterday at the
office in the Supreme Court quarters
occupied by Judge Harrison as a com
missioner and settled the questions of
who shall be clerk and when they
shall begin sessions. A. W. Johnson,
secretary of the commission, was
made clerk, and May 10 was fixed
upon as the date when the court of
this district will hold its first sitting.
Judges Cooper and Harrison will re
tain the offices now occupied by them
and Judge Hall will take that to be
vacated by General Chipman, who is
on the Third District bench. Of the
other three rooms, two will be set
aside for the clerk and his deputy and
one for the stenographer and the bai- !
liff.
JOHNSON CLERK OF FIRST.
The appointment of Johnson is the
end of an active political fight. James
jR. Oliver, secretary of the Prison
j Commission, was also a candidate. It
\ is said the main reason for his defeat
! is that he was deemed too valuable an
I employe for the Prison Board to let
1 go, so he and the many influential
! friends who worked for him have
' something to be gratified over, even
in defeat. Johnson was deputy Su
| preme Court clerk six years and has
; been secretary of the commission
â  three years.
Miss E. B. McKeen, stenographer
and assistant secretary of the Supreme
j Court Commission, is among the can- j
i didates for the position of deputy :
clerk of the First District Court. j
Neither a deputy clerk nor any other}
officer except the clerk was chosen at i
the meeting esterday.
The First District Judges have been
assigned 200 cases. They will take
I up first those that have been hang- <
i Ing fire the longest and in which there j
!is more urgent need of decisions. !
These number thirty or forty. To
hear and decide 200 cases is a year's
| work and cannot be done at one term. I
Thre are a number of applicants for
1 admission to the bar and the Judges i
| of the First District Court will hear j
: applications for certificates at the j
May session.
Judge Harrison will be the presiding '
Judge of the First, Judge Gray of the J
Second, and General Chipman of the i
Third District.
All nine of the Appellate Judges were
in this city yesterday. They held a i
consultation at General Chipman's of- ]
. flee during the afternoon and settled j
upon some necessary rules.
REPORTER'S SALARY SMALL.
Homer Wood, clerk of the Third ;
District Court, was present during part â¢
of the conference. Wood's appointment ,
was also arrived at after a warm po- â 
litical fight. It was announced that \
he was the special candidate of Gen
era] Chipman, but this is denied by ,
politicians on the inside, who say that
a totally different force brought about
his appointment.
The clerk of the Second District
! Court, in the jurisdiction of which is
Los Angeles, has not yet been ap- â¢
pointed. There is a flght for the place, j
among the leading candidates being
I Justice of the Peace Lillie of Visalia. |
J. M. Meredith of Los Angeles and j
1 Deputy County Clerk Warren of Los '
Angeles. The members of this court, r
Judges Wheaton A. Gray, M. T. Allen !
and George H. Smith, will meet early !
: next week in Los Angeles and make a ;
selection. In fixing its calendar the i
Second District Court will follow the
I lines of the Supreme Court.
For each of the three courts there j
remain to be appointed a deputy clerk, :
' a stenographer and a bailiff, the first j
1 two at $150 a month each, and the lat- ,
| ter at $100. â¢ There are few applica- !
! tions for the positions of reporters be- j
! cause of the smallness of the salary
1 and several of the new Judges have j
expiessed the opinion that the Legis-
I lature should have made the salary of
'â  this place larger.
The calendar" of the Third District
has been set for May 15. The members
I of this court, Judges N. P. Chipman, |
i A. J. Buckles and C. E. McLaughlin, j
! will meet in Sacramento Thursday to
select rooms at the State Capitol.
Those members of the new courts i
J who were Commissioners will grasp the !
i opportunity to take a vacation between j
j now and the calling of the calendars.

Attorney's Objection to Impanelment

for trial Â« yesterday his attorney , chal

i Judge : said ; that If the challenge was

NEW HOME OF MrSICAt
BURLESQUE UNDER WAY
It Is to Be Opened Next Month on
Mason Street by a Manager
From Xew York City.
San Francisco is soon to have a
home of musical burlesque under the
management of a man who has made
that form of stage offering succeed in
New York and other Eastern cities.
His name is Weber and he has leased
the Terrace Garden, on Mason street,
between Eddy and Eliis, and is now
transforming its interior to accord
with, his plan â the only plan, he avers,
by which such an enterprise can be
made permanently attractive to the
public and profitable to the manage
ment. A stage is in course of con
struction which will be sufficiently
spacious to admit of spectacularism,
and a set of principal performers, Â»
mixed chorus of twenty-four voices
and a comDlete orchestra are being
engaged. Lionel Lawrence, who has
produced some good things on O'Far
rell street, will direct the stage.
Instead of confining his audiences
to regulation theater seats. Manager
Weber will have them seated at tables
in both the auditorium and gallery,
where refreshments can be served. The
admission prices will be 50 and 25
cents and respectability is to be care
fully preserved in every respect. It is
the present intention to open tht* new
playhouse early in May with an at
tractive bill.
Dispute as to Signature.
Owing to a conflict of testimony
that clearly indicates free indulgence
in perjury by one side or the other
Justice at the Peace Dunn yesterday
postponed to May 1 further hearing
of the suit of Eugene Zimmerman
against Mrs. David Simpson for JIV,
alleged to be due as commission for
the sale of a piece of proper-
Ellert street. Zimmerman an-1
partner swear positively that the de-
fendant signed the contract, and Mm
Simpson and her son make oath with
equal firmness that the signature is
not hers.
