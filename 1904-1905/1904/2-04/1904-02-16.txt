RUSSIAN FEET LEAVES PORT ARTHUR
TO ATTACK THE SEAPORTS OF JAPAN
PORT ARTHUR,Feb. 15.â The Russian fleet is moving in the direction of Korea or South Japan. It is reported that the Rus
sian fleet intends to bombard the nearest port and will leave the forts to defend Port Arthur. Two of the vessels damaged in the
first engagement have been repaired and have joined the fleet. The third probably will be repaired within a week.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 15.â Instructions were received to-day by the Canadian Pacific Railroad officials containing permission
from the British War Office for British naval reserve steamships on the Pacific to carry foodstuffs of all kinds to Japan during the
war between Japan and Russia, unless the latter should successfully blockade the ports of the former. â¢

PANICKY STAMPEDE

AFTER THE BATTLE

CHEFU, Feb. is-(q:.SO a . m .,
eastern time).â The day on which the
Japanese made the torpedo attack on
Port Arthur was Admiral Stark's
birthday. The occasion was being
celebrated with a banquet, at which
were present many naval officers.
The stampede at Port Arthur on
that day gave rise to dreadful scenes.
Hundreds of persons rushed to the
streets from shops and houses, leav
ing everything, even their bank
books, behind. They boarded trains,
where they were packed like herrings.
Among them, cowering in a fourth
class carriage, was Baron Ginsberg,
whose timber concessions on the Yalu
practically caused the war. A shell
burst in front of his office. The rail
way officials wanted the men to leave
the train entirely to the women and
children, but they refused.

No Japanese battleships have been
seen in the roadstead of Tatungkau,
at the mouth of the Yalu River.
LONDON, Feb. 16.â The volumi
nous dispatches from the Far East
published here this morning are again
characterized by absence of real light
on ~the, situation. Numerous uncon
firmed and. conflicting rumors are
given, and among them is a report of
another engagement. at Port Arthur,
in which the Russians lost eight ves
selo sunk and ten captured. '
A correspondent of the Daily Mail
who witnessed the engagement off
Port Arthur confirms this morning
his previous accounts of the fight and
asserts again that one Japanese tor
pedo boat was sunk and another de
set ted by its crew in a sinking condi

Russians. ., He says also that the
Japanese lost one battleship and had
one cruiser put out of action and that

JAPANESE DETAIN
THE FRENCH CRUISER
PASCAL AT CHE3IULPO
SEOUL, Feb. 13.â The French
cruiser Pascal has been detained at
the last moment at Chemulpo, owing
to the objections raised by the Japan

the Russian refugees, which is con
sidered by them most unsatisfactory.
Twenty-three of the wounded Rus

care of the Japanese Red Cross.
The Russian gunboat Rasbovnik has
been captured at Masampho bv .the

TYPICAL RUSSIAN '
CITY IN THE CENTER
OF MANCHURIA
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â What, the
Russians have accomplished at Har
bin, the great inland metropolis of
Manchuria, is told in a report to the
State Department by Miller, the Amer
ican Consul at Newchwang. Harbin
Is on the Sungari River, at the junc
tion of the Manchurian branch of the
Siberian Railway, and the Chinese
Eastern branch, where it starts south
to Dalny, Port Arthur being distant
from the last point 600 miles. Miller
says Harbin is destined soon to become
the commercial center of Manchuria,
as it is the geographical center, and
that the city on all sides for hundreds
of miles is surrounded with a rich and
productive agricultural country. Of
the administration of this metropolis
Miller says:
"It Is as distinctly a Russian city as
though it were located in the heart of
Russia, and none but Russians and
Chinese are permitted to own land, con
struct buildings or engage in any per
manent enterprise. The city has been
created by the Russian Government
under the management of the Manchu
rian Railway Company. The land for
many miles in each direction' has been
secured against foreigners, who are not
recognized as having any rights what
ever, but are permitted there merely
on sufferance."
With a population of 12,000 in 1902,
Harbin by the census of last year
showed 60,000 inhabitants, exclusive of
soldiers. Only 700 of the inhabitants are
foreigners. There are no Americans.
The city has elegant administration
buildings, railway shops costing more
than $1,000,000, hospitals; commercial,
technical, Russian and Chinese schools;
clubs, hotels and a bank, representing a
total investment in buildings alone of
$15,450,000.
The capital of the foremost enter
prises is supplied by Siberian Jews.
Harbin was started primarily as a mil
itary center and an administrative
town for the government and direction
of railway affairs. Its marvelous com
mercial development was an after
thought.

CLOAKS MOBILIZATION
Assembling of Forces at Various
Military Bases Is Proceeding
VV ltllULLL llll-IvlCllL.
SHANGHAI, Feb. 15.â Advices from
Nagasaki dated Friday, February 12,
state that absolute reticence is main
tained by the Government. An intense
war feeling prevails among all classes,
although there la an apparent absence
of excitement. Among the striking
features of the situation are the strict
censorship which is exercised over all
cablegrams and the close concealment
of military and naval movements. It
has been the Government's policy to
have the news of naval conflicts come
as a complete surprise. The Japanese
themselves | did not know the destina
tion of their warships. The news of
Japanese successes has caused sup
pressed exultation. The only demon
strations have been made by news
boys, wearing bells, who are constantly
scurrying through the city with "ex
tras" which. are frequently issued by
the papers. These are eagerly read
and occasional shouts of "Bansai," the
Japanese hurrah, are heard on the
street.
A torchlight procession in honor of
the Japanese triumphs was called for
Wednesday evening in Nagasaki, where
there is a large colony of Russians.
When the Japanese began to assemble
with lanterns the police intervened and
dispersed the crowd, without the oc
currence of. any disorder.
The Russians in Japan are not ter
rified by the situation, but nevertheless,
acting on the advice of their Consuls,
Jiiey have begun a general exodus.
The mobilization of the Japanese
army has been carried out methodically.
It is estimated that 300,000 troops are
now ready to be placed in the field,
without impairing the national de
fenses. The movements of the troops
are shrouded in secrecy. They are be
ing moved at night toward such bases
as Sasebo, Kure, Moji and Yokosuka,
and the lights of ordinary trains are
extinguished when in the neighborhood
o: troop trains.
Members of the reserve force im

TO-DAY'S WAR NEWS.
IJcwvy reinforcements for Russia are rciwrted as moving toward
Ifurbia and through Manchuria.
Japan has already landed 20,000 troops at Chemulpo.
Belated reports of the naval action at Chemulpo continue to flow
In, evidently having: been held up by the censor and released en bloc.
These reports bear further testimony to the coolness and inflexibility
of the Japanese admiral, the courage of the Russian commander and
his men in moving out to a hopeless fljjht and the evident sympathy of
the naval commanders. of the other powers gathered In Chemulpo for
the officers and men who so gallantly went forth to certain defeat and
probable death.
As grave international questions have arisen from the acts of the
naval commanders, it is' gratifying to note that the captain of the
United States cruiser Vicksburg made every effort to keep himself and
his nation free from entanglements.
From Port Arthur comes the unexpected announcement that the
Russian fleet is moving in, the direction of Korea or the south of Japan.
Tjvo of the injured battleships, it is said, have been repaired and are
with the fleet. v The news lacks -verification. If true Japan's move
ment "of troops 'to 'Chemulpo is threatened and the Mikado's fleet must
fight a decisive battle for the control of the sea.
is perfect and a full equipment is ready
for each one of the reserves.
Hundreds of hotels, tea houses and
temples have been requisitioned in To
kio and other divisional centers. All
the steamships of Japanese merchant
lines are being rapidly converted into
auxiliary cruisers,- armed with quick
firing guns and fitted with torpedo
tubes.
The Government officials refuse to
give out any information regafding
their military intentions. They expect
to profit by dissensions in the Russian
Council of State. It is believed that
the extraordinary powers conferred on
Viceroy Alexieff will lead to a clash
between Foreign Minister â¢ Lamsdorff
and General Kuropatkin, especially as
the latter Is unfriendly to Alexieff.
The disagreement between these two
Russian leaders is expected here to end
in a military muddle. The Japanese
are convinced that the Russians will
be unable to concentrate and maintain
50,000 troop3 at any important point of
military operations.
There is much talk current in. regard
to the possible dynamiting of the Rus
sian railroad In Manchuria. Thousands
of Japanese, who are practically un
distinguishable from Chinese, are work
ing in Manchuria and would willingly
risk their lives for their country's cause.
A large body of troops Is due in
Nagasaki on Saturday to embark on
transports for Korea.
A protective system 1 of mines has
been placed about the entrance of
Nagasaki harbor. Yokohama also Is
guarded by mines. â /
Several Russian merchant vessels
which have been captured and have
been held as prizes have been taken
to Sasebo, where they are -well guarded.
All passing steamships are closely in
spected by a, flotilla o$-torpedo-boats.
Nine transports fitted " with - stables
on their_ decks were lying at Mojl on

PARIS, Feb. 15.â The Foreign' Office
to-day confirmed the announcements

that Russia and France approved of the
United States note on the subject of
Chinese neutrality, with a reservation
excluding Manchuria. '
The success of the American initia

various reclies will constitute an ac
cord of, the powers without signing a
further agreement.
The American officials here expect
Russia to issue a declaration similarto
that of the Japanese, favoring the prin
ciples of the accord, but the French
Foreign Office -understands that Rus
sia's brief approval, already given, con
stitutes Russia's response. .
TJie general view, including that of
the American officials, is that' the ac
cord will prove of inestimable benefit
in limiting the conflict strictly to Rus.
sia and Japan, thus keeping out Great
Britain, France, : China and all other
powers, and also /circumscribing : the
zone of the 'conflict. This , view, how
ever, is not accepted by, every one, cer
tain high quarters; holding that : Russia
secured real benefits from the accord by
the indirect; admission; of the powers
tor the time i that â¢ Manchuria \ is â¢ to : be
treated differently from the rest of
China, The i American , answer to this
is that Manchuria is excluded from the
qocord merely, because ; actual war op
erations are proceeding there, but there
is reason* to bejleve that Russia at-
taches much importance to the powers
excepting Manchuria from the accord
dealing with China.
The* only advices received here con
cerning the operations in the field show
the gradual, concentration , of Russian
and Japanese trgops near the Yalu
River.
A question has arisen concerning the
powers' acceptance of the third clause
cf Japan's declaration relative to her
recognition of China's neutrality. This
clause approves China's neutrality, but
adds 7hat China will be expected to
maintain garrisons at Shanhaikwan
and other strategical points. It is said
that the European powers will not ap
prove of this condition, as It will have
the effect of requiring China to do gar
rison'duty helpful to Japan and indi
rectly prejudicial to Russia. It is also
claimed that the condition is contrary
to the spirit of strict neutrality contem
plated by the American note.
Jaures, leader of the Socialist party
(which holds the balance of power in
Parliament), until recently Vice Presi
dent of the chamber, has made a dec
laration, contemplating the immediate
denunciation of the Franco-Russian
alliance, which has attracted a great
deal of attention in diplomatic circles.
The declaration was made at St.
Etienne, where the Socialist Congress
is sitting. According to the St. Etienne
Tribune, the Socialist organ In that
city; Jaures said:- ~
"Elapsed years and past experience
have demonstrated that Germany,
from which aggression was to be ex
pected, does not wish for war. Experi
ence shows that the alliance with Rus
sia, which has been directed, above all,
first against Germany, has lost the
reasons for its existence."
According to the Petite Republique, a
Socialist paper of Paris, Jaures said:
"Do nothing which will provoke
Japan and nothing which will provoke
England, and then denounce the alli
ance that has become dangerous. Let
us defend ourselves."
French politicians recognize that
there is considerable difference be-
tween the St. Etienne Tribune's report
and that of the Petite Republique, but,
whatever were Jaures 1 exact words,
his consideration of the Franco-Rus
sian alliance will have a decided bear
ing, should it become necessary for
France to be placed in the position of
having: to decide whether or not to
support Russia.

Epec'.al War Corr*>Â«pori<Iert of The Call
TOKIO. Jan. CO.â The best informa
tion now obtainable points to the be
ginning of hostilities between Japan
s^Tid Rusfia within a. very short time.
It seems rrobabie that before this let
ter reaches the California coast the
long: threatened war v.-ill be an .actual-'*
i*5\ yet on the surface there is v almost
no indication h<?re? bouts of the serious
crisis which the nation is facing. Out
xvar.iy Tokio, ar.d in fact all Japan,
vicars a calm such as would never be
Ehowni in the United States under sim
ilar circumstances. Tourists come and
SO in the usual way and the shops do
thrir customary bnsir.efp. The guides
btp al! <pn^agrd. although it is not the
tmsy season. Tho people are occupied
in thfir usual vocations. Xo crowds
Bather in the streets r.r public places
and there is no Fijm ot general excite
rnrnt. Five weeks ago there was much
more indication of thf nation's temper
and interest than now. But then the
newspapers were printing' every day
reports of tho preparations for war
rapidly going forward. The came an
imperial ordinance forhiddir.fr referenc2
to t! .â  movements of troops or war ves-
Bels. The little crowds that had gath
ered about the newspaper ofiices to
r^ad the papers posted on the bulletin
boards no linger collect there. War
"news" has almost entirely disap
pear d from the public prints, being
conlined now to vasrue hint? and to talk
about the "Fituation." A great conspir
acy rf silence lias b*Â»en formed, with
the whole Japanese people as the con-
Fpirator?. Reference to "the war" pro
duces a smile and ;. deprecatory wave
cf the hand* and th^t is all. The man
ner in which the nation has responded
to th? official injunction of silence is
extraordinary. The secrecy that began
officially has become popular, and now
:. dragnet would not turn up a Jap
anese who knew anything.
Uniy in the administrative oiTic.es are
there any FisÂ»ns of what is going on.
The peneral staff and the War and
Navy departments are busy â s>Â» busy

accustomed to the manner in which the
American newspapers report such sit
uations the references in the local
papers are amusing. YesterJay there
was an important meeting; of the war
council. This' morning's papers frrcvely
record that such-ar.d-such gentlemen
met at such-and-?ut h a place yester
day morning at such an hour and con
tinued hi session for ?o m*ny hours.
Of ".'-hat they did cr discussed there is
not a hint. The movements of the
diff"rent officials are thus solemnly
chronicled, and nothing more.
MOVKMEXT' OF TROOPS.
Meantime the movement of troops
goes on steadily, bat at night. Rail
road traffic is not interfered with, at
>ara.not enough to attract public at
tention, and if it were no attention
xnould be paid to it. It is popularly
believed that the. entire army is ready
for any emergency. Certain prepar
atory pteps have bÂ«>en taken which
it was useless to attempt to conceal.
such as the requisitioning of steam
ships of the great companies. But
beyond the fact that they have beon
taken over not a. word has reached
the public concerning these ships.
Many of them have European or
American officers. The captain of one

of the big Nippon Yusen Kaisha lin
ers is a stockholder in a corporation
which is operating mines in Japan.
Recently an increase in the stock was
voted and word was sent to this cap
tain to know if he desired to take up
his allotment, his attorney not caring
to undertake such an important de
cision. There was no reply. The ship
had been requisitioned by the Govern
ment and it was understood that she
was at the Yokosuka naval station.
The attorney tried several times , to
get word to the captain. He went to
the navy department and explained
the business and the urgency of his
need of communicating with hi3 cli
ent. Yesterday he receiver) word that
there was no use in his making fur
ther effortsâ no communication of
any sort would be permitted to
reach the captain, nor would he be
permitted to r-^ly if any communica
tion shouM : li him.
The. theory ..! all this is plausible.
Japan is not at war with Russia as
yet and she <loes not choose to have
Russia informed as to any prepara
tions she may be making for any such
an eventuality. Were they reported
with official consent or authority, it
could be easily represented by Russia
as an unfriendly act.
But in being correct Japan is act
ing like the man who stood up so
straight that he leaned over back
ward. A curious effect of her caution
is to be found in the book and picture
shops. Only a little while ago photo
graphs of the Japanese warships were
on common sale anrl albums showing
views of practically all the vessels of
the navy were hawked about. Pic
tures of naval and military men were
to be had at most of the photograph
shops, as well ar, many views of re
views, drills and sham battle?. Now
not one is to be had. All have been
srlthdrawn by order of the Govern
ment, as if it were possible for the
rtupsian.s .to obtain any information
from such a source of which they
have not long ago possessed them
selves.
HATRED OF THE RISSIAX
So secretly has the Government acted
that it is doubtful if a half-dozen men
in all Japan know to-day exactly what
all the row is about or could detail the
course o/ the negotiations with Russia
since the situation became dangerous
to peace. There have been notes and
notes, and replies and replies. Borne
were principal notes and some were
principal replies, and out of it all if one
had the time and patience a mosaic
eot'ld be patched up which probably
would fairly represent the truth. No
statement of any sort as to the causes
of the differences with Russia or their
character has been made by any one In
authority. The nation is on the verge
of war because of demands upon Rus
sia the nature of which the populace
does not pretend to know. Nor does it
care much. The fundamental causes of
the general hatred of Russia are well
known to every Japanese. The author
ities have no need to work up a public
pentfment for the war. On the contrary,
their tark is more in the way of re
pressing the belligerent feeling of the
people. The extraordinary patriotism
of the Japanese Will lead them to sup
port the war whatever Its causen. When
the time comes perhaps the four or five
statesmen at the head of affairs who
now know what all of these notes and
replies have said will think it wise to
make public their Information. If they
do the people will be glad; but if they
do not it will be all right, and there will
be no failure of enthusiasm for war on
that account.
It Is a situation which could not exist
in the United States. There is a care
fully directed campaign of secrecy,
which, involves watching everything
and everybody. Private and press tele
grams have been closely scrutinized for
some time, and a secret censorship has
been in force. The man who filed a
press telegram had no means of finding
out whether his message had been sent
or not, and if it were sent he had no
means of ascertaining whether it had
been garbled by the . censor. No one
knew who the censor was "or the loca
tion of his office, and it was useless to
attempt to find out anything about it
from any of the telegraph people. Pri
vate messages which were prepaid were
In a slightly better case. When words
were stricken from them . the sender
was notified in the course of a few days
and the money for those words refund
ed. He at least had the satisfaction of
knowing that his message had not gone
as he wrote It. .Now the censo rate has
been modified a little, and a press cor-

respondent can learn within a day or
two after filing a message whether the
censor has stopped "from the. sixth to

SYSTKM OF ESPIONAGE.
It !s a bad time for those who have
2ny underhanded business to transact.
Th? svFtt-ni Oi espionage covers 101
eigners and natives alike, and if there
is anything it misses it is very small.
The care which considers the possible
meaning of private telegrams also in
spects the goings and comings of pri
vate, oersons. The other day two
Amerk-ms came out of a hotel In To
kio and started for a morning walk.
Before they had gone far they discov
ered that thev were followed. Both
were husky men and th^y gave the spy
a merry <:hase for an hour. Then they
brought him back to the hotel, and
while one kept him occupied the other
went into the Jhotel and got an inter
preter. Then they demanded. to know
what he meant by following them.
There was an exciting debate, between
the interpreter and the other, then the
interpreter said:
"He says he is from the country and
has never been in Tokio before in his
life. You are the first foreigners he has
ever seen, and he. was so much inter
ested in your manner and your dress
and your talk that he followed you. He
meant no offense and asks your par
don." :
But all the time war preparations go
on rapidly. There is no question that
the Japanese authorities know exactly
what ther have to do to beat Russia.
Their military information is wonder
ful. When they went to war with <VhIna
ten years ago they, not only knew the
character of their enemy; they knew
the topography of the country over
which they expected to fight and they
knew the condition and equipment of
the Chinese troops. It is not too much
to say that they are now prepared
against the Russians fully as well as
against the Chinese, if not better. They
know as well as the Russians how
many Muscovite troops there are in
Manchuria and Eastern Siberia, and
where they are stationed. Ever since
the Russianization of Manchuria be
gan the Japanese have looked forward
to the time when they would fight, and
have prepared for it. They have stud
ied the country in minute detail.. Their
maps show the result of, this work. In
dividual huts and clumps of trees are
shown. Their knowledge of the ter
rain is complete. It is doubtful if the
Russians themselves areas, well in
formed as to ' the topography of the
battle ground, be It Manchuria or Ko
rea, as the Japanese. For some years
there have been in the neighborhood of
10,000 Japanese In Manchuria. and 30,000
jn Korea. Nearly every one of them
has been a source of Information to the
military authorities here, and V not. a
few of them have been military men In
one disguise, or another. ( V;. :"
SPIES IN ROLE. OF SERVANTS.

maps the Japanese have a way of
making them first on a rather small

tions. Then smaller maps show more

smaller sections are. shown in still
greater detail. I saw some of the
maps they used in the Boxer campaign
in China and they were marvelous.
Every bunch of trees and every hut,
every turn of the road, every change
of elevation was shown. The working
maps by which the column was guided
were only about two- feet square and
the seals was so large that they
showed but a small section of the
country.
Such estimates as the Japanese war
authorities have permitted to become
public fix the number of Russian
troops at present available for this
war as approximately 200,000. includ
ing the railway guards. It is prob
able that since tlmt estimate was
nublished the Russians had brought
forward all the reinforcements they
could, but the limitations of their
transportation make it doubtful if
such reinforcements have exceeded
40,000. To meet this force the Jap
anese are apparently relying on their
regular army. If they have any ex
pectation of calling out volunteers no
intimation of it has become known.
The army is organized on the skeleton
plan, each company in peace times
numbering about half what its full
war cuota is. There are twelve regu
lar divisions and the Imperial Guard,
which constitutes a division by itself.
Each division consists of two brigades
of infantry, each brigade being com
posed of two regiments. The regi
ment is organized like .our own. of
three battalions of four companies.

TOKIO, Jan. 30. â To understand fully
the critical situation in which Japan
now finds herself one must go back
into her history for many years. Un
doubtedly Russia's action in depriving
her of the fruits of her victory over
the Chinese in* the war of 1894-5 has
done much to crystallize among the
Japanese people the hatred which now
longs to find expression in armed ac
tion. But the ultimate cause lies much
deeper. . .
For 2000 years Japan has been Inti
mately associated with or concerned in
Korea. Many of her people came from
the hermit kingdom.' Her instruction
in the Buddhist religion was given by
Koreans. The beginnings of her civ
ilization were Korean. Subsequently
when she outgrew her preceptor she
conquered Korea and enforced tribute.
Now she fs the mentor and Korea the
pupil. In sentiment and in~religion
their ties are strong. Japan feels that
if there is to be any development of
the Korean peninsula in the wayu of
modern civilization it must come
through her agency. Moreover, a mat
ter of military necessity, the very life
of the nation depending upon it, Korea
must either be preserved in her integ
rity and Independence or come under
Japanese influence completely, if not
into Japanese possession.
But as long ago as 1882 the watchful
Japanese saw Russia beginning to
move toward Korea. Even then she
realized what that might mean, and
she warned Russia that there must be
no encroachment by her upon the Ko
rean peninsula. Russia smiled and dis
claimed in the usual way. Even then
Japan was beginning to feel the press
of increasing population. Now her
yearly increase is in the neighborhood
of 600,000. Her territory is occupied al
most to the limit. Only one Island,
Hokkaido in the .north, yet affords an
outlet to her thronging people, and
every year from 60.000 to 80,000 of them
find new homes there. Already the
limit is in sight. There must be an
other outlet.-
When the war with China offered the
chance of obtaining a foothold on the
continent of Asia that might have
But the companies are nearly twice
the size* of ours' when in active service,
numbering on the. war footing 240
men, so that a battalion is about a
thousand strong. Besides the infan
try each division has a regiment of
field or mountain, artillery, two battal
ions of three batteries, six guns in a
battery, 120 men to a battery. The
guns. are of. Japanese invention ? and
make and are capable of doing fine
work. Each division also has a regi
ment of cavalry such as it is. The
horses of the Japanese are very poor
and the men are not specially skillful
as riders.
Military observers rate the cavalry
as very poor. Certainly it is not near
ly the equal of the Russian Cossack
force. Each regiment consists of
three squadrons â troops we should
call them â of about 150 men each.
There is also in each division a bat
talion of engineers, who are among
the best soldiers of Japan, very highly
trained. Besides these there are the
regular commissariat and supply
trains and the sanitary, or medical
corps. All told, on the war footing,
each division consists of about 15,000
men This makes the fighting line
number about 200.000.
In peace the army is hardly half
that size. Every man on reaching the
age of 21 is required to serve with
the colors, but there are many exemp
tions in peace times. After three
years with the colors the men go into
the first reserve for five years. In war
the righting line is at once filled up to
the limit from the first reserve. It is
this fact which accounts for the con
fusion of reports now current as to
whether i the first reserve has been
called out or not. In part it has, and
in part it is standing by for orders to
go. What movements of troops there
have been havs been conducted very
secretly. For the most part they have
been at night. Not long ago the cap
tain of one of the big London liners
that had been requisitioned for trans
port service spent the night ashore in
Yokohama. In tho morning he was
sent -for hurriedly to go aboard. On
reaching his ship he found her full of
troops that had been put on in the
night. Immediately the ship sailed
and only the men high in authority
know where she went.
It is idle to speculate upon what the
movements of the army, will be when
once war is begun. Sooner or later,
however, Korea will undoubtedly be
occupied. Russia cannot prevent that.
The Japanese have the inestimable ad
vantage of a well protected interior
line of communication with Korea.
From Moji to Fusan it is only a night's
steaming. Midway lies Tsushima, with
its great fortifications. Flanked on
either side by the Japanese ships the
Russians would have to exert their en
tire naval strength to force the pas
sage to get at tho Japanese transports,
and It does not seem likely that they
would risk such an .Â»ngagement. It is
popularly believed here that the first
move will be naval. The Japanese
have forbidden newspaper men to ac
company the first operations, either
naval or land, and have issued very
stringent regulations covering the
case.' r Commanders of naval stations
or of Meets are empowered to estab
lish what are termed strategical sea
areas, into which no ship may come
without permission. The captain who
endeavors to enter such an area
against the wish of the commander
may- be sent back in charge of an
armed . vessel and imprisoned and
fined*
One' great advantage the Japanese
navy has is of inestimable value. There
are three great unitsâ the battleship
squadron, the armored cruiser squad
ron and. the cruiser squadron. For
months each squadron has been ma
neuvering by itself, with frequent
grand maneuvers embracing the en
tire navy. At the naval station at
Takeshikl, in Tsushima, twenty tor
pedo * vessels have been practicing in
one flotilla. The result is that every
officer of every, vessel knows not only
what his own ship will do under any
given circumstance, but also what
every other ship will do. That intri
cate and: valuable bit of naval Infor
mation, the helm angle of each ship,
is matter of common knowledge. They
can maneuver, as well in the dark as
in the light, and. if a ship is transferred
from -one squadron to another she but
comes back to old mates who know
her well and no new drill is required
to; fit her; to the new conditions.

'opened a way to relief it was eagerly
grasped. Then, through the aggression
of Russia and the incredible stupidity
of Great Britain, that chance was lost.
The statesmen of Japan saw and real
ized what a blow Japan had received;
her people knew and understood the
humiliating affront which had been put
upon her. The suspicion of RÂ«s^a
which had been felt by the men at the
head of affairs, became a hatred of teÂ»
rible intensity among the common peo
ple.
PREPARES FOR CONFLICT.
Then came the Russian lease of Port
Arthur, and Japan saw her enemy In
possession of the Liaotung peninsula
from which she had been ejected. It
i* an old story how she began then to
prepare for the conflict now about to
break. At the time of the Boxer out
break in 1900 Japan received new evi
dence of the Russian intention. Oreat
Britain and the United States asked
Japan to send her troops to the relle..
of the beleaguered legations in Peking.
Russia protested. Already her designs
on Manchuria were becoming clear.
The Boxers gave her an opportunity.
Immediately after the relief of Peking
she recalled her troops from Chill and
put them into Manchuria. The horror
of Blagovechensk she turned to her
own account.
Japan understood and prepared to
counter by bringing her troops from
China to Korea, but she was not yet
ready for the conflict that might have
precipitated and her men came back
to Japan. She knew the shiftiness of.
Russian promise, but for the time she
was content to strive to obtain its ful
fillment. Russia promised to evacuate
Manchuria and Japan hoped to see the
promise made good. She had given up
hope, at least for the time, of obtaining
the needed footing on the continent,
but she now saw with increasing alarm
the evidences of Russian aggression
upon Korea. When the time set for
Russian evacuation of Manchuria came
and passed and the Russian troops still
held their ground Japan knew that the
time had come to act. Russia not only
refused to leave Manchuria, but ad
vanced toward Korea, Already her
subjects had secured a lease at Mas
ampho, almost in sight of the Japanese
coast. In spite of the explanation that
it was only a private enterprise, purely
commercial. Japan recognized the
menace to her interests. Then began
the series of negotiations aimed at
reaching a settlement of the matter
which Japan could fool would be defin
ite. But each Japanese step was met
by a further advance of Russian de
mand. Russia secured a concession at
Yongampho. south of the Yalu River.
Japan began to prepare to fight. No
one realized better than she the char
acter of the undertaking, but no one
knows so well as she that it is for her
very life.
War is not made because of the fail
ure of negotiations; it is a world move
ment which mere human agencies can
not control. *The old, huge Russian
with his insatiable earth-hunger finds
himself, at the close of his long journey
to the open sea at the East, face to
face with the new-bom Japanese,
feeling at last the irresistible urge of
the press of population. The conflict
is inevitable. It is no irruption of wild
barbarians choking down an old civil
ization to secure new homes for them
selves. It is a new civilization work-
Ing out its.destiny in the path of world
development. The Western Oriental
and the Eastern Occidental are at
grips.
The Japanese reformation "rom cen
turies of exclusion and inactivity Is yet
in its infancy, but it s t.s accomplished
wonders. Now Japan feels that if this
civilization, with all that it means to
the world, is to be engrafted, even
though it be but faintly, upon the ef
fete hermit kingdom, it must be
through the agency of her people, who
know and understand the Koreans and
Chinese as no other people of the
world do.
"Russia is not a civilizer," said one
of, the old Japanese, statesmen to me
yesterday. "There are but two classes
in Russiaâ the rulers, who are corrupt
through and through, and the Ignorant,
stupid, unintelligent peasant, with his
centuries of oppression and misrule
behind him. The vaunted Greek church
itself is not a civilize?. On the con
trary. It is rotten and- corrupt as the
governing class behind It. I say that
Russia is not entitled to attempt the
redemption. of an Asiatic people. She
does not mean to do It. Her interest is
purely selfish."
It is a conflict of civilizations. Korea
will either fall under the slow mov
ing Russian or come under the Influ
ence of the active Japanese. For Japan
it means much more than for Russia:
but the Japanese statesmen realize that
even if they win in the war their re
lief will be but temporary- Korea, with
its 8.000,000 or 10,000,000 of people, is
only half as large again as Nebraska.
Yet they call It thinly settled. Open to
unrestricted Japanese immigration it
will afford relief for but a few years at
the most. In climate and soil it ia
suitable for the Japanese. "When it is
occupied there is nothing In sight be
yond.
There Is a curious difference between
the Japanese public and private declar
ations concerning Korea. Publicly they
profess to desire the preservation of
the integrity and independence of the
peninsula. Privately they admit that
the destiny of Korea is absorption by
Japan. They realize that Us occupa
tion by them can no longer be delayed,
and whether there is war with Russia
or not that will occur very soon.

United States Consul
Protests Against
Outrages.
NEWCHWANG, Sunday, Feb. 14. â
About fifty Japanese men on their way
to Tientsin were arrested at Taihai
chou on February 12 with their wo
men and arrived here in custody. The
American Consul, Henry T. Miller,
procured the release of the women,
but Viceroy Alexieff ordered their re
arrest and transportation, together
wit h all the Japanese in Manchuria, to
l'ort Arthur.
Miller based his action on assur
ances the Russians gave the Japanese
C< nsul that all Japanese subjects
would be protected and permitted to
lnave when they desired.
There are numerous Japanese com
plaints of Russian ill-treatment- Jt
is alleged that 4 00 Japanese refugees
from Harbin and elsewhere, who ar
rived at Mukden on February 10,
vert* arrested and that many of them
vore severely beaten and detained un
til they purchased their release. When
they were liberated the Japanese were
pent in open trucks to Taihaichou,
vheie- they were again maltreated and
sent oi. to Port Arthur. Some of their
voreen were sent to Xewchwang.
Consul Miller took the women under
his protection and sent them to Shan
kaikwan.
Miller protested to the civil admin
istration against the cruel treatment
of the Japanese refugees by Russian
soidiers and requested a census of all
Japanese transported to Port Arthur.
Th<- Consul himself was menaced by
a Cossack without provocation and the
DCsCer commanding at Newchwang ex
presspd his regrets and promised to
severely punish the Cossack. The civil
administrator promised to afford bet
ter i.roU-ction to the refugees.
Independent naval officers say the
Cesarevitch, Retvizan. Pallada and
Novik, damaged in the naval battle off
Port Arthur, cannot be repaired in
time to decide the command of the sea.
They also say the Russian land forces
are demoralized. They are trying to
â u'.itch tht- entire coast.
ThÂ« cflicers of the Russian gunboat
Sivocith at Newchwang declared they
are prepared to blow up their vessel
in case of danger. They are employ
ing a searchlight all night long over
the surrounding plains.
The cutting of telegraphic communl
c.-iriori threatens to complete the iso
lar: Â«m of the war zone, except by dis
patch boats. Admiral Alexieff has for
bidden all ships to enter any of the
ports of the Liaotung Peninsula. For
eigners are not permitted to move
without military permission.
Tl>e foreign missions at Mukden,
apprehending a Chinese outbreak, are
sending the missionaries and their
fanilits away.
The reports that Japanese ships
have been seen using searchlights off
Newc-hwang and off the coast near
Jlinchou are fictitious.
There are about 2000 troops now at
Newchwang.
JAPANESE SECTION
.. HANDS CONTRIBUTE
TO THE WAR FUND
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 15.â Six thou
sand dollars has been raised toward
the war assistance fund by local Jap
anese. Amounts have been received
ranging from $25 to 52000 by S. Ban,
head ot the committee.
"What do you think?" he eald to
day. "A party of five Japanese section
hands on a railroad cent in 5150 from
Junction City this morning. Each one
contributed from $25 to $30. In a few
days we will have raised $10,000, and
this amount will immediately be sent
to Japan. We will then start on an
other fund. Notices and subscription
lists have been sent throughout the
State and they will bear golden fruit.
I headed the list with $2000, and the
clerks in my office all gave from $100
to $200 apiece. Every one is enthusi
astic over the fund.
- "We are not desirous of receiving
contributions from Americans at pres
ent. We want to make this first con
tribution all our own."
About a dozen of the naval reserves
of this city, Who have been called to
Bervice in Japan, will leave for their
country on the next Maru liner from
Seattle.
BRITISH NEGOTIATIONS
WITH RUSSIA ON THE
MANCHURIAN QUESTION
LONDON, Feb. 15.â A lengthy pre

correspondence regarding the Russian
occupation of Manchuria, covering the
period f^m July. 1900, to January 8,
1904. . ; â "- "
On the latter date Count Bencken
darff, the Russian Embassador to Great
Britain, communicated to former Sec
retary Lansdowne a formal declara
tion that Russia would not Interfere
with the existing treaty rights of the
powers. Lord Lansdowne expressed
satisfaction with these assurances, but
he expressed 'his regret that Russia
should have found it impossible to takÂ»
even a single step in pursuance of a
policy which the thus .prescribed fcrr
herself, and said that the people of
England were looking for some con
crete evidence of Russia's intention to
fulfill her promise. . For example, the
announcement that Newchwang would
be evacuated at an early date would
have a reassuring effect, and Lord
Lansdowne was not aware of any local
difficulty in the way of this movement.

KEEPING RUSSIAN FLEET
BUSY WHILE ARMY LANDS
Attacks Upon Port Arthur Made to Prevent
Interference With Japan's Military
Programme.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.âInforma
tion has reached here that nearly 20,000
Japanese troops were landed at Che
mulpo yesterday, the first division of
a large number which will be thrown
into Korea as rapidly as possible in
the effort to thoroughly occupy the
strategic points In the Korean empire,
while the Russian fleet is bottled up
in Port Arthur. By one conversant
with the Japanese plans it is said that
the repeated attacks upon Port Arthui'
are not for the purpose of seizing that
place at present, unless an unexpected
weakness in the fortifications there
should develop. They are part of a
well defined plan for the harassing of
the Russian fleet until Korea can be
occupied. The bottling up of the fleet
there enables the landing of troops In
Korea without the convoy of a large
number of warships. The reports of
disorder In various parts of Korea has
tened the operations of the Japanese,
in order that they might obtain posses
sion before anarchy became prevalent
and foreign interests were menaced in
consequence.
The taking of Port Arthur will form
the second number of the war pro
gramme. First, however, it is learned
that the Japanese propose to cut the
line of communication well up on the
railroad running from Newchwang to
Port Arthur. It Is expected a large
Japanese force will land at Newchwang
shortly for this purpose.
The Navy Department denies posi
tively that any American naval officers
were aboard the Japanese ships In the
fighting at Port Arthur. It is said
that our Government requested permis
sion of both Russia and Japan to place
an American naval officer with each of
the fleets, not as a combatant, but
purely in the capacity of an observer.
While neither power refused the re
quest outright, still they did not ac
cede.
The War Department is having
equally bad luck In trying to place
military observers with the land forces
of Russia and Japan. Right officers
were selected for this duty and re
quests were made that they be per
mitted to accompany the forces in the
field, but a favorable response has not
yet been received, and Ifis feared that
it will not be.
Takahira, the Japanese Minister,
called upon Secretary Hay to-day, and
it is understood that the reported de
tention of about 100 Japanese subjects
in Port Arthur was under discussion.
There seems to be a lack of positive
Information on the subject, and until
the facts are known the State Depart
ment is inclined to go slowly In repre
sentations to Russia. It is bound to
make them, however, if Japan formally
requests it, as the department has un
dertaken to represent Japan so far as
the interests of Japanese subjects in
Russia are concerned.
Taklng notice of the reported escape
from Port Arthur of the American
cargo ship Pleiades, under cover of a
storm, the department officials are in
clined to believe that she may have
brought away some of the detained
Japanese. It is said that large license
is accorded by international law to
military commanders in such cases as
those and they freely exercise discre
tionary power as to the ingress and
egress into and from towns practically
besieged, like Port Arthur, of persons
who might carry damaging informa
tion to the foe.
The Insular Bureau of the War De
partment is informed that the value
of the Mexican* dollar at Hongkong to
day was 48li cents, a Jump of two
points since Saturday noon. This places
the coin on a practical parity with our
own silver Philippine peso. The Mexi-
fHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 190Â£.
can dollar has practically advanced
from 37 cents to its present figure
within a year. This last increase is
explained at the War Department by
the statement that the war has caused
a heavy drain, Chinese and Japanese
merchants converting much of their
stock into cash to be prepared for
emergencies. The result is expected to
be the practical extirpation of the Mex
ican dollar in the Philippines, an ob
ject very much desired, for a heavy
import duty on Mexican dollars will
keep them out of the islands, once they
are withdrawn.
ACCOUNT OF PORT
ARTHUR BATTLE AS
RECEIVED IN RUSSIA
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 15.â The first
unofficial account of the battle off Port
Arthur on Tuesday last has been re
ceived In a telegram dated Port Arthur,
February 9. It la as follows:
"At half past eleven the Japanese
squadron of fifteen vesels began the
bombardment of Port Arthur. Our
squadron and the fortresses replied and
the battle lasted forty minutes.
"The Japanese squadron could not
stand the well-placed first fire of our
fleet and forts, and began a rapid re
tirement. The Japanese flagship was
seriously damaged and, according to
the testimony of an eye witness, five
other Japanese ships were considerably
damaged. Boats belonging to the port
report that they saw two Japanese
ships sinking at sea.
"Our losses afloat were two officers
wounded, one so slightly that he con
tinued fighting; six men killed and
fifty-four wounded. In the forts two
men were slightly wounded. The bom
bardment of the forts and the town did
no damage, but frightened the pop
ulace. At intervals during the night,
firing was heard at sea."
The dispatch adds that the temper of
the army and navy is excellent and
that the bulletins circulated by the
Novyerai have begun to tranquilize the
people. No attempts have been made
by the Japanese to land on the Kwang
tung Peninsula.
The repairs to the ships damaged by
the torpedo attack are proceeding rap-
Idly.
Captain Belllaeff of the gunboat Ko
rutz, which was sunk at Chemulpo,
writing to relatives on January 9, just
previous to the battle, said:
"I am ready to go to sea at any min
ute. From day to day we have been
expecting a fight with the Japanese.
We expect sudden attacks, without a
previous declaration of war. The wood
en fittings are being taken ashore. We
have no armor; our strength is only in
the guns and the courage of our men.
We Russians often depend on courage,
and the outcome Is all right. It may
happen that It will not fail us now. I
shall do all possible. If they send us
to the bottom, say a good word for us."
FREQUENT FIRING
OCCURS IN THE BAY
OF PORT ARTHUR
CHEFU", Feb. 15.â The steamship
Wenchow, arriving from Port; Arthur
reports that eleven Russian ships were
struck in Tuesday's engagement. It Is
said that the cruiser Askold, with a big
holn at the water line, has been toWed
into the inner basin and beached. The
battleship Sevastopol has a shell hole
just above the water line and is useless
RUSSIAN WARSHIP AND
TORPEDO BOATS PASSING
THROUGH SUEZ CANAL.
In rough weather. The cruiser Novik
has a hole In her afterport side. The
battleship Retvizan Is on the beach and
her bottom has fallen out. The cruiser
Pallada was torpedoed abaft the en
gine-room. The battleship Cesarevitch,
which also was torpedoed, has been
docked. The others were chiefly dam
aged in their upper works.
The whole iieet has been taken into
the inner harbor, and Port Arthur Is
depending for protection upon her forts,
which have been reinforced. There is
frequent firing, which is. presumably
drawn by Japanese torpedo-boats. Fir
ing was heard at midnight on February
11 at intervals; also on the night of the
12th and 13th. On February 14 the fir
ing continued until 5 o'clock in the aft
ernoon.
An eyewitness claims to have seen
eighteen dead landed from the Russian
ships on Tuesday. It is understood that
Admiral Stark has been reduced for his
failure to repulse the Japanese attack.
The cruiser Novik was the only vessel
to do effective work. She gave chase
to, the Japanese torpedo-boats, and ac
cording to the Russian account sank
two and captured one.
The Wenchow had 400 Japanese refu
gees on .board, and there was an ex
citing time during the battle, as shells
fell all around the Wenchow. After
several orders were given her to leave
port and as often revoked, she was al
lowed to sail on February 14. The Rus
sian authorities supplied her Japanese
passengers with rice, but paid no at
tention to a signal for a fresh supply of
water. .
It is said that the European residents
of Port Arthur have been reassured, but
.that the Chinese are making frantic ef
forts to get away. Reports of Russian
victories are, it is said, being circulated
to buoy up the hopes of the residents.
It is apparent that the Russians have
for the present decided not to use their
fleet, but to depend upon the land
forces. Eleven ships will have to be re
paired before she can take the ag
gressive on the sea.
. The captain of the Wenchow reports
that he was held at Port Arthur until
all the Japanese in the vicinity were
gathered and placed aboard. Japanese
were brought from points as far away
as Harbin. A few Japanese are left in
Manchuria. The .refugees left their
homes and stores, ' in many instances
losing thousands of dollars.
Several Japanese have been arrested
on the charge of having in their pos
session maps and charts. Refugees who
go to Japan can give the Government
valuable information.

LOSSES OF THE FLEETS
IN FIRST NAVAL FIGHT
Uncensored Account by Eye Says
Japanese Battleship^ Cruiser and Two
Torpedo Boats Were Disabled.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 15.â A correspondent
who says he was an eye-witness of the
Port Arthur naval fight sends from
Yinkow (Manchuria), the port of New
chwang, under date of February 11, the
following uncensored story:
About midnight on Monday the town
was aroused by the firing ofÂ»big guns.
Six Japanese torpedo-boats had ap
proached within half a mile of the Rus
sian fleet and were showing lights,
funnels and signals just like those of
the Russians. The Japanese torpedo
boats crept quite close to the Russian
ships before they were discovered.
Each of the Japanese boats discharged
torpedoes, three of which took effect,
striking the battleships Cesarevitch and
Retzivan and the cruiser Pallada. The
three damaged ships returned to the
harbor to avoid sinking.
Notwithstanding the continuous fire
from the ships and forts four of the
Japanese torpedo-boats escaped. One,
however, was sunk and another, which
was in a sinking condition, was desert
ed by the crew and was afterward cap
tured by the Russians. The action
ceased at 3 o'clock in the morning.
The loss on the Russian ships was
eight killed and twenty wounded.
Apart from the disablement of three
Russian ships the damage done to the
fleet and forts was not very great.
The Japanese fleet again came in
sight about 11 o'clock on Tuesday fore
noon. There were In all fifteen ships in
two lines of battleâ six battleships, six
first-class cruisers and three second
class cruisers. The Russians had out
side thirteen large vessels under Ad
miral Stark. After the commencement
of the action the populace fled toward
the hill outside of town.
On both sides I counted more than
300 shells, few of which reached the
mark. The others did not explode.
The Japanese warships steamed slow
ly past, in line of battle, to the west
ward and about four miles off, each
vessel beginning to fire when opposite
the Russian ships, which were two
miles off shore. The action became gen
eral. There was no maneuvering, sim
ply heavy and fast firing.
The firing ceased at noon, the Jap
anese ships withdrawing to the south
ward, having one battleship and one
large cruiser put out of action. One
small boat was chased and was sunk
by the Novlk (Russian), which after
ward received a shell at the water line,
but reached port all right, Admiral
Stark signaling "Well done," while all
the rest of the fleet cheered her ar
rival.- Even the three Russian ships
aground fired during the action.
The casualties on the Russian side
were twenty-two killed and sixty-four
wounded. Nearly half of the casual
ties occurred on the Pallada and Novik.
The Japanese fleet sailed southward
at 1 p. m. and all was quiet.
ITO'S SENTIMENTS
TOWARD AMERICANS
TOLD IN WRITING
TOKIO. Feb. 15.â Marquis Ito to
day gave the press a written expres
sion of hl$ sentiments toward . the
American people, as follows:
"It is with profound satisfaction that
I see so many symptoms of spontane
ous sympathy with which the free
thinking people of your great nation
seem to watch the present crisis. In
my opinion it was evident that Russia's
high-handed ; expansion toward the
hegemony of the East, combined with
her recent strenuous military efforts
hereabouts, has been becoming a daily
increasing menace to our own future
safety and peaceful existence. Either
to enter into a cordial and durable un
derstanding with her, clearl" defining
and mutually recognizing the respec
tive spheres of interests and binding
her thereby to a certain amount of
self-restraint in the future, or else to
have recourse to measures for safe
guarding our future independence, ere
it was too late, was the drastic di
lemma from which we could not longer
escape. We have tried our best to ob
tain our object by the first alternative
and we have sacrificed much energy
and time and many opportunities for
the sake of peace. Having failed, how
ever, there remains no other way for
us but to stand up in defense of our
own future safety and our own future
undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of
peace and civilization. No trace of race
prejudice, no smack of revenge or
chauvinism, nothing but the cool rea
son of state necessity and of self
preservation Influenced Japan's action.
The rest I leave to the impartial judg
ment of civilized nations, which In the
course of their past history must have
had many experiences of noble strug
gles In defense of the honor and safety
of country.
"I take this opportunity of express-
Ing my thanks once more for all thÂ«
cordial hospitality shown me during
my sojourn in America."
RUSSIAN FLEET IS
SEEN OFF THE SOUTH
COAST OF JAPAN
NAGASAKI, Feb. 15.â The French
and Russian Ministers to Korea have
requested the Japanese Government to
allow the survivors of the Russian
ships Variag and Korutz, which were
sunk in the fight at Chemulpo, to pro
ceed to Shanghai. They guarantee
that the Russians will remain there
until the war ends. ,
Martial law has been proclaimed in
Nagasaki. It is rumored that a Rus
sian fleet has been seen off the south
coast of Japan. The East Asiatic
Company's steamship Manchuria has
been captured and has arrived at
Sasebo.
The steamship Manchuria sailed
from Copenhagen on November 20 for
Port Arthur and Vladivostok. She is
of 370S net tons register and was built
at Copenhagen in 1891.

Thursday, Feb. 11. â In consequence
of the attack by the Japanese upon
Port Arthur Viceroy Alexieff has or
dered all foreigners and civilians to
leave that place. The families of the
Russian officers in Manchuria are be
ing sent to Russia and this is causing
great pressure upon the railway. Dalny
was the first place to -be deserted.
These non-combatants and civilians
have abandoned all their property at
Port Arthur and Dalny.
The Russians freely admit their
unpreparednesa for the Japanese at
tack to have been a terrible blunder.
Only half the shir>s were in line of
battle and their officers were ashore
celebrating the anniversary of Vice
roy Alexieff's birth.
A stirring episode was the re-en
trance into the harbor of the war
ships Cesarevitch and Novik after the
fight, They came in under their own
steam, with bands playing and men
cheering. Throughout the afternoon
and night of February 9 wounded men
were being removed to the shore.
PORT ARTHUR, Saturday, Feb. 13.
In answer to the demand of the
British Government for an explana
tion of British ships having been held
up by the Russians at Port Arthur
Viceroy Alexieff replied that the ves
sels were detained because they had
Japanese on board.
The shots fired at the British
steamer Fuping by the Russian guard
ship at Port Arthur as the Fuping was
leaving that port last Tuesday were,
the Viceroy says, due to a misunder
standing on the part of the officers
of the guardship.

of Newchwang during the war. the
P'oreign War Secretary, Earl Percy,
replied that the Government did not
consider it to be practicable to neu
tralize any territory in the actual oc
cupation of either of the belligerents.
Home Secretary Akers-Douglas, con
firming press dispatches, announced
that the British Government not only
had not been approached with a sug
gestion that it should consent to the
Russian Black Sea fleet passing out
through the Dardanelles, but said
there was no reason whatever for sup
posing tttat Russia contemplated such
a violation of her treaty obligations to
tho European powers.
Foreign Minister Lansdowne an
nounced in the House of Lords to-day
that he had received a cable message
from the commander in chief of the
Chinese station giving absolute denial
of the report that the Japanese f.eet
had been allowed to use Weihalwei
as a base of operations against Port
Arthur. The commander in chief
added:
"Weihaiwel did not know operations
were proceeding until I notified them.
In fact, Weihaiwei's first direct knowl
edge of belligerent proceedings was
the visit of the steamship Fuping to
report the circumstances of her being
fired upon when leaving Port Arthur.
The air is full of baseless rumors, ob
viously deliberately concocted."
The White Star Line steamer Ma
jestic, which is to sail Wednesday
from Liverpool for New York, will
take among her passengers the Earl
of Caithness and General Sir William
Nicholson, director general of mili
tary intelligence of the War Office, and
Colonel J. A. L. Haldane of the Gor
don Highlanders, who will accompany
the Japanese armies in the field.

he was not in any way responsible,
nor was he aware that it had been per
petrated until the evidence had been
adduced before the Elections Commit
tee of the House. It was not done,
he said further, for the purpose of caus
ing his election.
As he announced the conclusion of
cipht years' service in this manner,
most unsatisfactory to himself, his
voice betokened the emotion he felt.
The hush which spread over the floor
and galleries "when the purport of his
remarks was realized became almost
painful. But when he sat down with
words of thanks on his lips for the
treatment he had received from his
colleagues on both sides of the cham
ber applause burst forth and continued
long and heartily. The Democratic
members arc-se almost en masse and
extended personal expressions of sym
pathy and encouragement.
BESCVtS OF AN INQUIRY.
Mr. Glmsted, chairman of the com
mittee in charge of the contest, recog
nized the unusual position Mr. Shafroth
had taken. He said the investigation
by his committee exonerated Mr. Shaf
roth from ai:y connection with the ir
regularities which had been shewn.
The stand taken, he paid, was a most
manly and courageous one. The com
mittee had taken no action toward
formulating its report to the House
on the case, and the surprising initia
tive taken by Mr. Shafroth as has been
explained, by him was based on the
showing made by the handwriting ex
pert employed to examine the ballots.
Mr. Shafroth's statement was as fol
lows:
"Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question or
personal privilege in the contested
election case of Robert W. Bonynge
against Sh^froth. It was stipulated
and agreed by contestant and con
testee that the ballots cast at that
election in the twenty-four contested
precincts should be brought before the
Committee on Elections of this House
and opened for the first time in
the presence of its members. The bal
lots were those cast at the general |
election of 3302 for State officers and
Representatives in Congress. The ob
ject was that the original arrangement,
form and condition of the ballots
Fhould be seen hrst by the committee.
The ballots were shipped to the Clerk
of the House of Representatives at the
joint expense cf Congress, contestant
and contestee.
INSPECTION OF BALLOTS.
"At the first meeting of the commit
tee for the hearing of the caee the bal
lots were presented for inspection. A
Kub-committee was appointed to ascer
tain how many illegal ballots were
contained therein. It was agreed that
in order to facilitate their work their
session should be executive. The sub
committee opened the ballots from
three precincts, and, finding that it
took one week to examine them, asked
the House for authority to employ an
expert, which was granted. Since that
time the expert has been examining
thÂ»? ballots, and on Thursday last he
made his report to the committee. The

BUTTE, Mont., Feb. 15.â Albert J.
Beckman, who on October 13 last shot
and killed Helen Kelly because she re
jected him after accepting presents
from him, was found guilty by a jury
in Judge McClernons court to-night of
murder in the second degree and sen
tenced to ninety-nirse years in prison.
On Saturday while his counsel was
addressing the jury Beckman tried to
commit suicide by cutting a gash in
his throat. The wound was not serious.
To-day he tried to throw himself from
the Courthouse window, but was re

trial.
The jury disagreed on the first trial.
His defense was insanity.
committee then ordered that the par
ties should have one week's time in
which to examine the ballots and then,
if either of us desired to send to the
expert for the purpose of examining
them, that we should have that privi
lege. The case was to be argued before
the committee.
"On Thursday afternoon I com
menced examining the ballots and con
tinued doing so through Friday and
Saturday. I do not believe that 2792
illegal votes were cast (that being the
majority as returned), yet my exami
nation disclosed the fact that the as
surance which I had received as to the
regularity of the votes in many of the
precincts was not true and that there
were illegal votes therein which taint
ed the polls, and the polls so tainted
gave me a greater plurality than my
returned majority.
"That fact was a bitter disappoint
ment to me, but nevertheless true. The
law is that when a poll is tainted by
fraud and it Is impossible to purge the
poll of the fraudulent votes the vote
of the entire precinct, legal or illegal,
must be thrown out. The committee
has given me every opportunity to as
certain the illegal vote so as to save
the valid vote in those precincts. Until
I saw the ballots last Thursday I
thought the illegal vote could be de
tected and scratched from the legal
vote, but I must confess that my in
spection has convinced me that it is
Impossible to do so in this case.
DECLARATION" OF FRAUD.
"The case being as I have stated and
the number of precincts tainted con
taining majorities for me greater than
my returned majority, I must say that
if I were a Judge upon the bench con
sidering this case I would be compelled
to find against myself, and as the vote
In the contested precincts aggregates
less than one-tenth of the vote in the
Congressional district I would be com

Mr. Bonynge is entitled to the seat.
VI did my best to have an honest
election. My law partner, with my ap
proval, organized a citizens' commit
tee, composed of both Republicans and
Democrats who desired a fair man.
The headauarters of that committee,
as shown by the evidence in the case,
was the law offices of Rogers, Shafroth
& Gregg, Denver. I have always been
in favor of pure politics, and wheia
the test is applied to an election where
I was voted for as one of the candi

shirk my duty or change my convic

therefore say to the Committee on Elec

"As this is the last time I will have

I want to thank the Committee on Elec

chairman, Mr. Olmsted, the sub-com

LUMBER SHIP
GOES ASHORE
Schooner Alcalde, Bound for
Manila, Blown From Harbor
to Sea in Storm .and Wrecked
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND. Or., Feb. 15.â The
schooner Alcalde, in charge of Captain
L. B. Harris, laden with a cargo of
lumber, went ashore on the North Spit
outside the entrance of Grays Harbor,
Wash., and is a total wreck. Every one
was saved, the life crew rescuing: them.
Captain Harris had on board his 16
year-old daughter, who was making
the trip with him. The Alcalde loaded
at Aberdeen, Wash., with a cargo of
lumber for Manila and was towed to
the anchorage in the lower harbor
Saturday. A violent storm sprang up
during Sunday and increased until the
schooner began to drag her anchors.
Finally she broke away, losing both
anchors and 105 fathoms of chain, and
was blown out to sea. The wind
changed to the southeast and after
drifting around for several hours in the
fog and darkness she went ashore on
the North Spit. She carried 400,000 feet
of lumber worth about $5000. The
crew was brought to Westport this
afternoon.
An examination of the stranded
schooner made to-day by Captain Har
ris, who was taken to his vessel by
the life saving crew, disclosed the fact
that her hull is broken and nothing
can be done to save her. The Alcalde
was a wooden schooner of 321 gross
tonnage and was built In 1882 at Port
Blakeley. A. Anderson of San Fran
cisco is her managing owner. She was
valued at $20,000.

After Mr. Dlmsted' had made his
statement, following Mr. Shafroth, Mr.
Talbot, member of the same committee,
announced his concurrence in all that
the chairman had said, particularly in
that relating to the upright manner in
which Mr. Shafroth had acted through

NEW PLAN
NOW BEING
LAID OUT
A Few Streets to Be
Effaced, Others
'.Widened.*
BALTIMORE, Feb. 15.â At a meeting
of the Citizens' Committee td^day it
was the overwhelming sense of the
members that the city should be re
built on bread and generous lines and
all main streets widened. The plans
as mapped out provide that the streets
east and west shall be opened from
Jones Falls to Liberty street and be
perfectly straight, while those running
north and south shall extend from
Pratt street to Franklin street. Pratt,
Baltimore, Fayette and Lexington
streets are to be widened. German
street may be obliterated and there is
talk of filling the upper harbor with de
bris. The committee will probably rec
ommend the widening of St. Paul,
Lombard, Light and Pratt streets.
Should it be decided best to leave Ger
man street open it will be recommend
ed by the committee that it be opened
through to Gay street and that Hop
kins place run through Baltimore and
Fayette streets to Park avenue, â¢ a
change also being made in Liberty
street.
One of the results of the fire has been
a serious crippling of the work of the
Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Income of
which was largely derived from the
rent of buildings which it owned in the
burned district.
Sixty-eight warehouses, widely scat
tered, belonging to the hospital have
been destroyed, and the hospital has
lost the income from them for possibly
two years. The hospital property de
stroyed aggregates nearly $1,300,000 in
value.
The business situation was given a
most cheerful aspect to-day by a re
sumption of operations by the Clear
ing-Houae Association, the first since
February 6, and was materially
strengthened by the fact that banks
showed up in splendid condition, the
clearings being three times the normal
amount.

SEATTLE, Feb. 15.â The lumber war
between the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company and the steam schooner own
ers, which has been nearing an acute
stage for several weeks, will be settled,
according to parties concerned. A con
ference between representatives of both
interests is being held in San Franciaco.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company,
unless the compromise is prevented,

Engine and Coach Jump Track.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 15â A special
consisting of an engine and a caboose
was wrecked on the Carquinez branch
ot the Southern Pacific last night near
Kenwood. Nobody was hurt. The spe
cial had brought a carload of Japaneso
â¢to a ranch in the Los Gulllcos Valley,
and was returning when on rounding
a curve the engine left the. track and
was overturned. Traffic is delayed and
the wrecking crew is still at work. The
engine was from South Vallejo and was
not equipped with pony trucks, which
accounts for the accident.
GUARD BATTLES
WITH FIREBUG
Watchman Finds a Masked
-Man in Act of Setting Blaze
to the Portland Flour Mills
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND. Feb. 15.â A fight be
tween the night watchman and an un
known masked man, who attempted to
burn down the Portland Flouring Mills,
and in which seven shots were fired,
occurred last night. That the guardian
of the property was not murdered by
the incendiary was due to the fact that
he wore over his breast a large watch
man's clock, the back of which is made
of heavy iron. A shot from the revolver
of the thug struck the center of the
timepiece, smashed it to splinters, mak
ing a heavy indentation in the metal.
The attemDt to burn the mills was
the latest of a series of incendiary
operations and came near ending in a
fatality, for when Watchman Ber
bethea discovered the firebug he at once
called to him to halt. At that time the
incendiary was bending over a pile of
kindling. The firebug made no reply,
but seeing he was discovered started
to run. Berbethea then opened fire.
Then the fusillade began, for the man
turned and returned the fire. The shoU
whizzed past Berbethea's head. The
last shot was the one that struck the
large clock, then the firebug turned and
made good his escape.
Owing to the attempt to burn down
the mill property, which 1b one of the
most valuable upon the Pacific Coast,
officials of the company stated this
morning that a double array of armed
guards will be placed about the prem
ises.

Light Drizzle in Santa Clara
County Promises to Develop
Into a Great Downpour
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SAN JOSE. Feb. 15.â A number of
showers occurred early this evening
and a light rain now falling promises
to continue during the night. A south
wind to-day leads to the belief another
storm is setting in. While there is not
need of rain at present, everybody
welcomes it. Up to noon to-day 4.95
inches had fallen for the season,
against 10.13 inches for last season.
The Santa Clara College weather bu
reau predicts a heavy storm and abun
dant rain to follow if adverse wind
does not intervene.
REDDING, Feb. 15.â A severe rain
storm, extending as far north as Duns
muir, caused the Sacramento River to
rise rapidly. The stream is fifteen feet
above ,normal and this evening is risÂ»
ing at the rate of a. foot an hour. It is
feared a portion or all of the county
bridge over the stream at this point
will be carried away, as the structure is
in the midst of repairs and is necessa
rily weakened. A landslide 200 feet
long on the Siskiyou has tied up rail
road traffic. A stiff wind, accompanied
by rain, caused some wire damage.
SANTA ROSA. Feb. 15.â Sonoma
County is having a series of severe
storms this season. In one recently
the rainfall amounted to 5.20 inches.
Another rain began in this city Sun
day, being only a slight drizzle during
the day. Early Monday morning the
rain began falling heavily and at 7
o'clock the rain gauge measured 1.05

year is 25.52 inches.
Two railroad disasters are recorded
from the recent storm. The morning

WARSHIP SAILS
TO GUANTANAMO
The Auxiliary Cruiser Prairie
Leaves Colon With a Battal

COLON. Feb. 15. â The United
States auxiliary cruiser Prairie with
a battalion of marines on board, un
der command of Major. Lucas, left
here to-night for Guantanamo. It ia
said that from that port she will go
to Santo Domingo.
The withdrawal of these marines
from the isthmus before the ratifica
tion of the treaty between Panama
and the United States is regarded as
an indication of the belief on the part
of the American authorities that
there is no probability of immediate
hostilities between Colombia and Pan

United States are continuing their
watchful patrol of the entire Pana
man coast.
SAN DOMINGO, Monday. Feb. 8. â
The United States cruisers Minneap

The level of the ocean is more con
tar.t than that of the land. The ex
)r>rÂ«:e of the ocean is three times .--â¢?
great RS that of the land, and its depth
more than ten times as great. If all
th*Â» lr.nd should be sunk in the ocean,
it ntrald raise the general water level
3r.lv about 300 feet. In general we
may Fay with perfect confidence that
:!ie ocean beds represent portions of
the earth's crust which have been
sinking: from thÂ«Â» eariiest geological
times, while thÂ« continents represent
those portions â which, with many os
rfllaUons. hnve. on the whole, been
rising. It probably is not truÂ»\ as is
often stated, that the areas of land
and watrr have shifted places in past
time, so thnt continents were found
where the main ocean beds now lie,
iiri-3 oceans swept without interruption
ovor the continental areas. Still
t!:rre is the best of evidence that
!arsrÂ«Â» portions of the existing conti
nents were at various "times below the
Ievri of the sea.
But. while this is true, it seems
equally certain that during the sub-
Fiden^e of theso areas below the sea
level they existed either as shallow
\v;:ter borders of the main continental
areas or as internal seas. For exam
1'le. the great, depth of sedimentary
rocks which cover the Mississippi ba
sin, extending from the Allegheny
Mountains to the Rocky Mountains,
are shallow water deposits. So shal
low, indeed, vraa the water during long
periods that it was little more than a
Fw.imp in which the vegetation that
f^tmed the numerous scams of coal
CDBld grow and nourish. But the lev
el VMM not constant. After a large
p.'.-i-iimulation of vegetable matter that
d be turned into coal had taken
place there was a slight and very gen
tl<Â» Linking of the whole area, so that
r.:ud and sand were brought in from
tlie neighboring higher lands to form
a' complete covering for the coal; so
that when it was turned into rock it
v.Â«? able to protect it and preserve it
for future ages. This process of slow
but irregular sinking of the Mississippi
barin continued until thousands of
feet of sedimentary material had been
washed into it, as the Mississippi is
carrying sediment into the Gulf of
Mexico at the present time. These
Fucre^sive strata, like the leaves of a
book, record the various downward
movements of the long coal period.
In other countries, especially in Eng
land and China, there is the same rec
ord of long continued I downward
movements of continental areas during
the coal period.
If this downward movement had con
tinued always the coal would have been
inaccessible beneath the depths of the
sea, where, indeed, much of it does still
remain. In Xova Scotia the best seams
of coal are mined many miles and at a
depth of many hundred feet below the
bottom of the sea. .In England also
S'jtne of the best seams of coal are fol
lowed out underneath the sea, and it
is supposed that coal veins are con
tinuous from southern England to the
C< ntincnt far beneath the bottom Â©f
Dover Strait. But" fortunately the
downward motion of the coal area was
in due time arrested, and the contrary
movement begun, which has brought
this priceless material within easy
reach of men in the mountains of Penn
sylvania and China, in the hills of Eng
land and in the plateaux of the cen
tral and. â¢western States of America.
Oih'r illustrations of groat changes in
in nd levels are too numerous to be men
tiun* d in detail. In Colorado there was
a pra>1ual subsidence of land below sea
level <1uring the carboniferous and cre
taceous areas until from 12.000 to 13.000
feet of pediment had accumulated over
the sinking area. But at the end of
that period the area began to rise and
Shis rise has continued untilthe present
time, when it stands many thousand
fc-ct above the level of the sea.
Similar witness to such changes of
level is borne by extensive sedimentary
ro< ks containing abundant sea shells
of late geological age. which are found
at a height of 10,000 feet above the sea
or. the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Cau
casus mountains, and at a height of
14.000 feet upon the mountains of Cen
tral Asia. A map of the eastern con
tinent during the early part of the ter
tiary period shows a great Mediter
ranean Sea covering "all Central Europa
and extending into Asia, submerging
the highlands of Thibet and most of
the mountains of Turkestan. But that
this was not a general subsidence of
tfie continents is evident from the sim
ple fact that these areas are covered
with sedimentary strata. If mud and
sand and gravel are deposited fn water
there must be some area not far awa>
from which they could be derived.
While these general facts concern
ing rnanses in land level in ancient
Geological times beyond all question
are very impressive, less attention than
they merit has been given to the facts
Ehouins that corresponding changes
are ctlll {joins .on, and have produced
Flriking results within recent times,

i.s th<\ most recent of all the geological
â¦-;>Â«( ha. these changes of level are very
evident nnd connect themselves with
the early history of mankind. At the
close of the tertiary pcrriod. which
culminated in the claclal er^ *Ue cea-
tral and northern part ofÂ«North Amer
ica stood at a level of 2000 or 3000
feet above that it at present occupies.
This is proved by the existence of in
numerable channels now deeply buried
by glacial debris, or extending out
into the ocean across the shallow, sub
merged shelf of the continent both
upofl the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
In Illinois, in Ohio and in Central New
York these buried channels .are found
down below sea level, showing that
the land must have been very much
elevated to allow the streams which
crossed these rocky gorges to make
their way to the sea from these dis
tant inland points. The ' cities of
Cleveland, Ohio, and Syracuse, N. Y.,
are built over such buried gorges. The
Delaware, the Hudson and the St. Law
rence rivers then emptied into the sea
100 miles or more east of the present
shore, running through deep gorges or
canyons, which crossed a level coastal
plain. The fiords of Greenland and of
Norway and of the Pacific coast of
North America bear similar testimony,
since they probably, in most cases,
mark the lines of ancient rivers which
coursed through them to the sea when
the land was so much elevated that
what are now the bottoms of these
channels were occupied by rushing
mountain torrents. In short, these
fiords are drowned river valleys.

(Copyright. 1904, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
A parent is no less a parent because
the child hasjattained years of so-caled
discretion. One feels at times that they
should be termed years of Indiscretion.
The relations with which we have to
do just now are those that exist be
tween the child and the parent â espe
cially the motherâ after the boy or girl
Is beyond the boundaries of the nur
seryâthat Is, after he has attained 10
or 12 years of age. It is at this point
that the young animal feels a desire for
freedom, and if not properfy curbed
this freedom will at times amount to
lawlessness.
It is safe to assert that the worst chil
dren in the civilized world are the
American children. I do not mean that
they are more vicious, more unprinci
pled than children of other nations, but
they are certainly less amenable to just
authority, less respectful to their elders
and more sure of themselves, their
rights and Independence. If one doubts
this let one note the manner of the
average girl or boy of 14 toward the
mother.
A few weeks ago in a crowded ele
vated train in which I had managed to
get a seat a mother, daughter and
father stood in the aisle directly in
front of me. I could not help overhear
ing their conversation. All were hand
somely dressed â the father and mother
evidently people of education. The
mother sighed wearily and said, to the
14-year-old girl that she was tired.
"Of course, you are," was the quick
rejoinder. "I told you if you took the
elevated you would have to stand. But
you would do it."
"But," said the mother, in gentle ex
planation, "it takes so much less time
to come this way."
"Well, then," was the pert rejoinder,
"if you are glad you came why do you
make so much fuss about It? You're
here, so let the matter drop!"
The mother, after the manner of the
obedient American maternal, subsided
into silence, and the father, hearing all
this conversation, administered no re
buke to the Impertinent child. Had she
been 40 instead of 14 she deserved
harsh censure for thus addressing a
person older than herself, and that per
son her mother.
Still, the mother was to blame more
than the child. Had she not been al
lowed to go wrong from her cradle,
speaking impertinently, she would not
do so now. One clever but disrespect
ful girl voiced this truth when her
mother, chiding her for impertinence,
added:
"Margaret, I now appreciate that you
were not spanked often enough when
you were a child."
The girl's eyes flashed.
"That was not my fault," she re
sponded. "If you did not see your duty
toward me then, you may pay for it
now."
Verily the education should have be
gun in childhood â yes, even in baby
hood.
Still, there are girls and boys who,
having been tractable in Infancy, feel
that when they leave the childish stage
they need no longer obey. This is the
case in nine homes out of ten. Mothers
ask: "What shall I do with my girl,
who- insists upon going to parties when
I think she should be studying?" "How
can I make my son study? He wants
to leave school now instead of taking
the course we had planned for him."
Ah, the pity of it all! And the evil
lies at the root of our system of child
training. There Is but one remedy. It
is that each home shall be a monarchy
In which father and mother are king
and queen, the children the loyal and
loving subiects. The law followed is
the law of love, always accompanied
by Justice. The children must feel that
love is back of everything, and that
If they neglect to obey this law, Justice
will step in. This is not an Impossible
state of affairs. I know one home in
which the children, growing "up to
men's estate, dread more seeing a look
of disappointment on the face of the
dear mother than they would the lash
of a whip. While young they learned
to obey, and as they grew older their
sense of Justice showed them that love
for them and unselfish - regard ft^ their
symmetrical development physically,
mentally, morally were the ruling pow
ers in the home. After the age of six
or seven years was attained punish
ment was never necessary. It should
not have been. With years of discre
tion should come the feeling of "no
bfesse oblige" that makes a boy or girl
honor the parents and respect them
selves too much to swerve Into paths
that are evil.
An Illinois woman Is said to have
confessed that she stole a lead pencil
twenty years ago and has just paid the
owner of the store for It.
"And yet there can be no doubt that
she meant to do the write thing when
she tools it

THE DEATH OF SENATOR HANNA.
THE country loses a conspicuous and honorable
personality in the death of Senator .Hanna. His
career was characteristically and creditably Amer
ican. Born in Ohio, when frontier conditions were upon
that State, he received his most valuable scholastic train
ing in the public schools and developed his remarkable
business faculty in assisting his father, who was in mer
cantile pursuits in Cleveland. The family is of Quaker
fctock and must have in it an element of great strength.
His cousin, Mr. H. H. Hanna of Indianapolis, the son of
his father's brother/is one of the foremost men of the
country, to whom we owe the improvement in our finan
cial legislation and the final adoption of the gold stand
ard.
The Senator early saw the business possibilities of the
lake traffic and the importance of the iron industry in
Northern Michigan and began development as the
builder of a lake fleet, the owner of mines and dealer in
iron products, in which he amassed his fortune. It â  is
mainly owing to his pioneering that the largest water
tonnage in the world, past a single point, passes Detroit
every year.
He was unknown in politics, except locally, until 1896.
In that year his exertions procured the nomination of
McKinley, between whom and him the tenderest friend
ship had long existed. As chairman of the Republican
National Committee he took charge of that remarkable
campaign, and it was his quick eye that, saw the turn in
the issues when the nomination of Mr. Bryan gave to the
Republican party the advantage of appearing as the advo
cate of v sound' money.
He was a great believer in the triumph of right princi
ples by right methods. His fearlessness of discussion
was shown during that campaign by his order to the
superintendent of his iron mines in Northern Michigan
to give all the employes a holiday to hear Mr. Bryan
speak in the town nearest to the mines.
He was appointed to the Senate March 5, 1897, to'
succeed John Sherman, who became Secretary of State.
In 1898 he was elected to complete the term and for the
succeeding full term, which expires March, 1905. The
present Legislature last month elected him to the term
expiring March, 191 1, by the largest majority ever given
a Senator in that State.
He was a most useful Senator. His capacity for work
and knowledge of affairs were utilized in the business of
the Senate. In debate he was skillful and successful, al
ways sustaining himself in a running fight, even with that
rough rider in discussion. Senator Tillman.
He was a man of plain life and most Jiumane impulses,
lovable and approachable in personal intercourse and a
promoter of good works and morality. He 'Organized
and headed the Civic Federation for the purpose of se
curing justice between employers and employes and end
ing industrial wars.
Though he was a delegate to the National Conventions
of his party in 1S84, 188S and 1S96, and was appointed
bj- President Cleveland a director of the Union Pacific
Railway, he excited no antagonisms until he entered the
arena as the champion of his friend McKinley. Then he
had to endure the abuse which is always the advertise
ment of the success and ability of its victim. But in his
case the sustained attack made upon him had an element
of virulence unusual in American politics. The first im
pression made by it upon public opinion was unfavorable
to him. But he went straight on and outlived it, having
the satisfaction of seeing himself entrenched in the re
spect of his countrymen as a sincere, upright and espe-
cially level-headed American.
He is the last of the older generation of Ohio men who
have so deeply impressed the destiny of their country
and will be sincerely mourned by the good men of all
parties and by all Americans who realize the force he
exerted for the honor and welfare of his country.
Charles E. Murphy, chief of Tammany, says he will
not permit the New York delegation to the Democratic
National Convention to be pledged to any Presidential
candidate. Mr. Murphy might have added that there is
nothing in the history of his organization to indicate that
it can be induced to stay pledged to any nominee.
AMERICANS ON JAPANESE SHIPS.
IT is reported that the Russian naval authorities are
much disquieted, in fact inclined, to panic, by the re
port that American naval officers are directing Ja
pan's ships of war. In this, country no naval officers on
the active list -have been missed, nor is it believed here
that the Japanese require such assistance. Many of their
naval officers were educated in our naval school at An
napolis, and the Japanese naval academy is modeled
after ours. In it her officers have been elaborately
trained in naval tactics, and, like all island people, sea
manship is instinctive with them.
The position of Japan in the East is much like that of
the British Isles in Europe. England maintained her in :
dependence by the seamanship of her people and the
strength of her navy. Since the destruction of the"Span
ish Armada her coasts have not been seriously threat
ened, and military authorities have' generally admitted
the impossibility of landing a hostile force on her shores.
In our two wars with Great. Britain we succeeded in of-
fensively protecting ourselves against her navy, but
made no attempt to invade her soil.
Japan has taken a lesson from the book of England's
experience, and has built a navy modern in all its equip
ment, and in seamanship and tactics, gunnery-and speed,
it is stronger than the exhibit made by comparative ton
nage. If she succeed in naval warfare her position will
exactly duplicate that of Great Britain.
Of course it is possible that 'she 'has in her. service
Americans who have been trained at Annapolis, but
there are grave doubts that any of them are on the ac
tive list of our navy. Russia should not be unduly ex
cited. Americans trained to war are fond of a fight, and
it is not unlikely that many will be found on. Japanese
ships, and even in her land forces. If they, choose to en
ter her service it is at their own risk, and their Govern
ment cannot prevent them. As Japanese officers . they
must have the same treatment as other men-at-arms, un
der the laws and rules of war. If captured they are pris
oners of war, subject to parole and exchange.
The only case in. which our Government could inter
fere would arise if Russia to treat them other
wise, and then we could only demand that they be ap-.
corded the same treatment as Japanese prisoners of war.
To refuse this would be a violation of the laws of war,
for which our Government, could demand and enforce
reprisals. Tn the Russian army are many Frenchmen,
one of the Bonapartes being a major general in com
mand in the Caucasus. During our Civil War French
men were in active service in the armies of the Confed
eracy and theUnion, one of the Bourbon Princes -being
on â¢ the staff of General McClellaru" 'In; the war between
Chile and Peru an American was a high officer in the
Feruvian army. When taken prisoner Chile condemned
him to be shot, but his life was saved by the British
Consul, who threatened to punish such violation of the
laws of war by bombarding Valparaiso.
If the present war be prolonged, no doubt, many
Americans and Englishmen will be found in the service
of Japan, but they will be there as individuals only, and
will in no sense be representative of their governments.
In the war between- Japan and China the Chinese war
ships were commanded by Germans, and no one inti
mated that their presence involved the German empire
in the struggle. There is a manifest disposition on the
part of Russia to kick at this country and Great Britain.
But she is entirely to blame for the sympathy of the
pe"5ple of both countries with Japan. She'has repeatedly
and flagrantly broken faith with both, in the failure to
evacuate Manchuria, and while the governments re
main neutral the people resent such tactics. The supe
rior civilization of Japan appeals to Americans and Eng
lishmen, who have no sympathy with a government
that turns the campus of its own universities into a
shambles,' and beats male and female students into sub
mission with Cossack whips.
It is true that Michael Davitt declares that the sym
pathies of Ireland are with Russia, but this is to be
taken with a grain of salt. It can hardly be possible that
any considerable number of liberty-loving people can
sympathize with a government that is using the sword
to cut out the ancient privileges of Finland, and op
presses and slaughters Jews. As Mr. Davitt was the
special'writer selected by Mr. Hearst to deal with the
Kishenev massacre, it is little less than remarkable that
he can sympathize with such a government as he de
scribed Russia to be.
To go back to the main question, there is every rea
son why Americans sympathize with Japan. Our pos
session of Hawaii and the Philippines has made us the"
dominant power in the Pacific. We want Eastern Asia
opened not to our trade exclusively, but to the com- 1
merce of the world. This is also the aspiration and pur
pose of Japan. But Russia seeks an exclusive control
wherever her foot is planted, that is not only a national
affront to us, but demotes us in the Pacific. Japan .is
pluckily fighting our battle, and if Americans choose to
enlist under her flag they are doing a perfectly natural
lt is said upon the highest authority that both Russia
and Japan are in sore need of money with which to
maintain an efficient state of war. From present san
guinary indications both powers will need a great deal
more money with which to restore habitable conditions
after war is over. '
A HARD TASK.
A CARD is now being circulated throtrgh the mails
by some gentlemen of Kansas City requesting
various persons of more or less local influence to
permit the use of their names as members of a "Nation
al Executive Committee," whose object is to nominate
and elect Hon. Alton B. Parker of New York to the
Presidency of the United States in 1904. .. . ' .
It is rather an indefinite way of making a canvass'. The
cards are evidently being distributed indiscriminately,
for the one that came to The Call, after stating that the
committee is to establish' "National Democratic Parker
for President Leagues in every voting place in the
United States," closes by saying: "If your time is too
much occupied, please hand the request to a 'Parker for
President,' live, always a Democrat, who will organize a
league to be known as No. 1 in your city, county, town
ship or voting place."
It will be conceded by any one who gives the subject
due thought that thejavor requested of us by the card
is a difficult one. It is not easy to find in this part of the
country a "live" Democrat who has been "always a
Democrat"; how tedious then would be the search for
one who in addition to being a live and a perennial, un
changing Democrat, is also a Parker for President
Democrat?
We are inclined to believe that most of the perennial
Democrats are" dead, while the live ones were most of
them at one time either Populists or Greenbackers or
something of that sort. It is doubtful if any of them
ever heard of Parker . or even so much as care to hear
about him.' Of course there may be a Parker for Presi
dent Democrat somewhere in the great West, and if
there be an advertisement in The Call would find him.
However, we have no intention of indulging in such
advertising, for it would be a gross wrong to bring up
some good citizen out of the quiet retirement where he
has had a chance to read Judge Parker's name and to re
member it, and put him into the forefront of his voting
district as an organizer of a Parker for President league,
thus exposing him to every brickbat a Bryanite can lay
bold of. .
There is at any rate no use hunting for a Parker
needle in the Democratic political haystack at this sea
son of the year when there are so many big things in
sight. We may as well let the search pass, content in
the assurance that if there be any such needle some Bry
anite candidate will find it the first time he happens to
sit down on the stack.
LOST, STRAYED OR STOLEN.
D. N Wednesday of last week the yellow journal pub
lished what purported to be a special dispatch
from Douglas Story writing from Chefu.,, On the
following day in the same journal Douglas Story wrote
another dispatch dated London. Thjpn, to the astonish
ment of lovers of. ubiquity, he disappeared or blew up.
Where. is Douglas Story now? Or, more pertinent
perhaps to the curiosity of tolerant readers that indulge
the nightmares which the local yellow sheet is forced to
substitute for news of the Russo-Japanese war, who- is
Douglas Story? On Wednesday he was at Chefu pic
turing events that happened neither on land nor on sea.
He was employing the longest leased wire in the world
tg describe battles that have not been fought except in
the riotous imagination of the Yellow Kid.
> On Thursday Douglas Story was'in London, thousands
of miles. away from Chefu, torturing opinions unthought
of by statesman and diplomats into expressions wild,
weird and impossible. But where is Douglas Story now?
Where has this commissioner plenipotentiary, this cm
bassador extraordinary of the Yellow Kid, this fabricator
of hideous dreams, gone? He is not in Chefu and he is
not in London. Ubiquitous as he doubtless is, is he in
San Francisco? ..-
Or is he of the stuff that dreams are made of? Was
the man' who created him on Wednesday out of town on
Thursday? Has" Douglas Story been lost, strayed or
stolen, or has he gone to join the other war correspond
ent of Yellow "Kidisrn, the immortal Hornbrook? The
Yellow "Kid. is hiding his blushing face behind his ears.

Cupid Danforth and Justice of the
Peace Lawson are of the opinion just at
present that the world is a very wicked
place. They reached this conclusion
several days ago after a little experience
they had with a handsome young man
and a dashing brunette, who requested
their aid In a matrimonial affair.
When the handsome young man got
the license to wed his charming com
panion from Danforth he asked to be
directed to a Justice of the Peace who
would tie the knot with little delay.
Danforth took him to the chambers of
Lawson, and In a very few minutes the
dashing pair became husband and wife.
As the happy couple were leaving the
Judge's rooms the groom, with a beam
ing smile and a very hearty "Thank
you, gentlemen," pressed a ten-dollar
gold piece into the hands of both Law
son and Danforth. "This for your trou
ble," he said in a most engaging man
ner.
Danforth and Lawson congratulated
each other, and then the Judge suggest
ed that as business was so good a trip
acrcfes the street would not be a bad
thing to take. "I concur," said Dan
forth, and forth they went.
They came back sadder but -wiser
men. The bartender refused to take
Danforth's newly acquired gold piece,
because it was not good, and Lawson's
was similarly treated. Danforth is not
so sad as he might have been, for the
$2 given hini for the marriage license
was good, at least.
Yerkes' First Venture.
Charles T. Terkes, who is now busy
supplying London with an adequate
rapid transit system, began his busi
ness career with a successful specula
tion that did not Involve the outlay of
a dollar. It was a Saturday afternoon
and he was strolling along a wharf
in Philadelphia, when he came to a
store where an auction sale was in
progress.
"How much am I offered for this box
of soap?" asked the auctioneer.
The 13-year-old boy looked at the
brand and saw that It was the same
soap as that used in his home. He
knew what his mother paid for it at
retail, and so he made a bid. The auc
tioneer smiled -at him, cried the bid
once, and said: "Sold toâ what's your
name, bub?"
"Charley Yerkes."
"Sold to Charley Yerkes for ."
Then another box was put up and bid
in by the boy. and this was continued
until fifty boxes had been struck off
to him. He had a deposit of $5 in a
savings bank, which had been there
for some months. He showed the auc
tioneer his certificates of deposit and
said he would soon return and pay for
the soap.
He went to the grocer witft whom
his family traded and asked him if he
wanted to buy some soap. The grocer
asked how much he had and what It
was worth. The lad" replied that he
had fifty boxes and that he would sell
the lot for a certain sum, naming an
amount double that which the soap
had cost him at the auction house. The
deal was closed, and then the store
keeper asked the lad how he had come
by It. When young Yerkes told him.
the man opened his eyes and said: "I
had Intended to go to that auction, but
forgot it." The boy did not draw his
$5 from the bank, and thereafter It was
his great pride to add to it. "It Is sur
prising." said he, not long ago. in tell

"Seen a Ghost."
The London Chronicle recounts tha
following remarkable suit Just com
pleted in an English court:
One of the most remarkable claims
under the workmen's compensa<ion act
has been heard at the Tredegar County
Court, the Judge reserving his (decision.
Frederick George SheUard. a lad
aged 14 years, was in the employ of
the Powells Tlllery Steam Coal Col
lieries Company in May last. He was
a pit boy, earning 10s a week as an as
sistant to his father, a collier. On me
occasion the father sent him to get
what Is known as a "stick."
Amid the gloom and loneliness of the
collier the lad says that he suddenly
felt something brush past him and he
was confronted by two glaring eyes.
This greatly terrified the lad. for most
miners are exceeding superstitious. He
cried out to his father to come and
help him. and was so evercome by
what he regarded as an apparition that
he had to be taken home.
Tlje Judge suggested that the eyes
were those of a cat, but the solicitor
for the lad did not readily assent to
this explanation.
Three days afterward the father took
the boy again to the collier, with a
view to convincing him that there was
nothing to alarm him. So great was
the shock, however, that the boy had
not been able to work underground
since. The medical evidence showed
that the lad now suffered from St.
Vitus* dance, brought about by fright.
Compensation was claimed at ths
rate of 5s 3d a week, but the company
repudiated liability.

A remarkable Instance of brigandage,

Adjutant General Drain of Washngton Gives Up Fight
:na Asks That Matter Be Postponedâ C.vil Service
Criticized and Pension and Cab Bills Harshly Treated
WASHINGTON. Feb. 15. â Senator
Perkins has received and submitted
resolutions adopted by the San Fran
cisco section of the Navy League of
the United States setting forth that the
"welfare of the country requires the
inauguration of such definite scheme
Â°f nrvil construction extending over
a term of years as will provide the
country with a homogeneous fleet of
war vessels of all needed classes and
of the most modern approved type;
ilie possession of k powerful neet
'would be a guarantee of peace. The
navy Â«jf the United States at the pres
oni time, the resolutions declare, is
composed of so many r.nd such vary
ing types of vessels as seriously to mar
its effectiveness and confine the ves
sels of greater speed, cos.1 endurance
arnl other features of effectiveness
to the sphere of action of those of in
ferior description. The California
delegation in Congress is urged indi
vidually and collectively to do what it
can to have the National Legislature
take such action as will remedy these
conditions and provide a scheme of
progressive naval development along
definite lines in the immediate future.
XEW MANEUVER CAMP.
"Adjutant General Drain of the
.Washington National Guard, who was
introduced by retiring Secretary Root
to the incoming Secretary Taft us the
best adjutant general of the National
<iuard. has been here some time look
ing after the interests of Washington
soldiery and largely as a champion of
a site on American Lake, near Puget
i^ound, as the rendezvous and maneu
ver camxÂ» for the West. This site has
the unqualified support and indorse
inent of General Funston. who was
delegated by the department to- In
ispect it. That it is not likely to be
chosen, however, is made to appear in
the fa.ct that General Drain has ad
dressed his eloquence and energy to
itaving the whole matter Indefinitely
postponed. The argument he has
bet-u met with in urging the selection
*>f the Pu_ret Sound site is that it is
too remote and to carry the National
Guard of Oregon and California to
Washington would be expensive with
regard to both time and money out of
:tll proportion to the reverse of the
proposition â that of carrying the
guard of the Northwest* to California.
The reason is that the number of
pruardsmen in Washington, Idaho and
Montana are comparatively few.
In behalf of the Washington site
General Drain urges that in the event
of war in the Orient the troops would
take ehii< at Pus;et Sound, he believes
â just why he so believes he does not
inake clear â and that the possession
of a camp ground there would be just
in* thing. In the meantime it would
be good practice for such an embark
ation to carry the troops there to
maneuver every year. If the selection
of a permanent camp is not made now
General Drain believes Congress and
the War Department may be brought
to this view at some later day. To
the average layman this would appear
to be simply handing the case over to
California and if contention among
the advocates in that State does not
keep the matter in the air choice will
piybabJy be inade there.
The proposed appropriation of so

which he suggests that the proper line

In accordance with the request
made by Senator Foster upon the

tified the Senator that he has suggest

possible, at a decision which will per

SEATTLE HAS COMPLAINT.
The Merchants' Association of Seat
tle has sent resolutions to the Wash
i::gton delegation in Congress with a
call for aid from the California dele
gation asking for tne repeal of the act
of Congress approved April 29 â "to
facilitate the procurement of statis
tics of trade between the United
States nnd its -non-contiguous terri
tory." Exporters, say the resolutions,
l;.;ve been and are now required un
der the Treasury Department regula
tions prescribed to file a manifest with
th*Â» customs authorities Bhowfns in de
tail the quantity and value of each
item of domestic merchandise Jn every

fiay, are the source of constant annoy
ence and expense to mercantile inter
ests engr-Tjred !n export trr.de to the
Philippines and Hawaii to an extent
out of all i^roportioii to the value of
the information obtained. The ef
forts of the delegation are asked to be
addressed to the repeal of the law.
While the House of Representatives
tm yesterday wrestling with the item
in the appropriation bill for a loan of
$4,500,000 to the St. Louis Exposition
thÂ« Senate was debating the proposed
nr'Propriation for Portland's Lewis and
Clark Exposition. In the latter case
Senator Perkins occupied the chair â
the discussion in both cases being in
committee of the whole. When, after
much amending of the bill and a ma
terial reduction of the appropriation

to a vote, Senator Perkins manifested
his Interest in behalf cf the Portland

' \VTLL FIGHT WAGON* ROAD.
General F. E. Ballaine, formerly ad
.lutant eeneral of the State of Wash
j::p:ton. is in the city prepared to oppose
certain features of Senator Nelson's
bj;i making an appropriation of $250,009
for the construction of a wagon road
from Valdez to Eagle City, Alaska.
General Ballaine believes this money,
if appropriated, should be placed In the
GRAPE-NUTS.
Ask Wife

hands of a commission authorized to
place it where it would do the most
good. By this it is quite clear General
Ballaine does not think it should be
spent on the Valdez-Eagle wagon road.
Senator Nelson, on the other hand, is
firmly of the opinion that this is ex
actly where the expenditure would do
the most good. This is only another
instance of that opposition on the part
of Alaskan promoters themselves that
works to the defeat of every good thing
for Alaska. General Ballaine is inter
ested in the Alaska Central Railwayâ
a railway proposed to be built from
Seward, a point on the coast at Cooks
Inlet, northward to the Tanana River.
The Alaskan Senatorial Commission of
last summer did not visit Seward, but
did stop at Valdez and was well re
ceived there, as of course they should
have been, in j?o far as a little settle
ment on that bleak coast could enter
tain eo distinguished- a party. Advo
cates of the Alaska Central speak of
this fart as accounting somewhat for
the difference in sentiment with regard
to the two places. There are many
representatives of the Valdez country
here urginp the necessity of the wagon
road, and there will be a warm contest
in committee concerning it. Ey-Unit
<?d States Senator Turner of Washing
ton is exDeoted to advocate the Alaska
Central at that time. These same peo
ple and interests will clash when the
bill introduced by Senator Mitchell
providing for a subsidy of $5000 prr
mile for every mi!<? of the proposed
Valdez, Copper River and Tanana
Railroad that is actually laid is pa3std.
The Alaska Central people will oppose
this with the simple and probably ef
fective declaration that they are asking
for no subsidy.
And now comes Mr. Humphrey of
Washington with a new bill proposing
an appropriation of $500,000 for a mili
tary and postroad from Valdez to
Eagle City on the Yukon, another
$500,000 for a road from Tyonick on
Cooks Inlet to Rampart on the Yukon,
and $500,000 for still another road from
Iliamna on Cooks Inlet to Holy Cross
Mission on the north bank of the
Yukon. The presumption is reasonable
that this generous and doubtless alto
gether proper measure will also be op
posed by Alaskans.
FIG1ITIXG CIVIL SERVICE.
Some week? ago when the civil appro
priation hill was under consideration in
the House that body registered a pro
test against the civil service as it is
operated, or as the civil service system
has worked itself out. The House,
working in committee of the whole,
; voted almost unitedly in favor of with
holding the appropriation for sustain
ing the civil service. Republicans and
Democrats alike excoriated the system
not as a system â a merit system â but
for its development â the condition to
which it had come. The service was
burdened with superannuated clerks,
which embarrassed the work of nearly
every department, and which clerks the
heads of departments suffering from
this embarrassment knew no way of
getting rid of. Of course, it was admit
ted the law gave to these heads of de
partments its authority for releasing
these clerks, made a way to get rid of
them, but custom had become stronger
than the law â no one had ever dis
charged these useless clerks, and there
fore no one ever would or ever could.
The head of one department was quoted
as saying that a large proportion of
his clerical force would be unable to
reach their desks If the elevators were
not running, and that he would under
take to do the work in his department
V>etter and more speedily if he were
given authority to make choice of 200
young and capable men to take the
place of the 500 who were on the payroll
in his office. It was in face of state
ments like this that the committee of
the whole voted to withhold the ap
propriation necessary to sustain the
civil service, while the members them
selves admitted that to withhold the
money would result only in embarrass
ment, for the treasury would still be
liable for the service. Therefore, hav
ing reported as committee of the whole
to the House this action, the House
when it came to a vote upon the propo
sition reversed the committee and sus
tained the appropriation by a large ma
jority. Nevertheless a protest had been
registered, nor was this the first time.
As a result of the sentiment created
the House Committee on Reform In
the Civil Service has begun a series of
hearings that are developing a great
deal of interesting information along
the lines indicated. Just what will re
sult is an open question. From the
testimony already adduced there ap
pear to be hundreds of old men on the
pay rolls, men who have grown old in
the serviceâ but who are not only
lengthening the roll, but interfering
wjth the effectiveness of the depart
ments. What is to be done with them
Is the thing to be determined. The dis
position to shy at a new pension roll is
very general in Congress.
CARRIAGE BILLS EXCESSIVE.
Another thing that developed in the
discussion of that same bill and which
reached no conclusion there has since
borne fruit or is in the process of bear
ing. Representative Landis Introduced
a resolution restricting the use of car
riages at the public expense and for
the public service, generally speaking,
to the Executive and heads of depart
ments. If the carriages for the use of
which the Government had to pay
were strung in line, he said, they
would reach from the Peace monu
mentâwhich stands In front of the
Capitol â to the Treasury, fifteen long
blocks away. Not only were the car
riages used by clerks and private sec
retaries, who might be -expected *to
take the street car, but the carriages
were driven by coachmen for whom
no provision was made in any appro
priation, and who, in order that their
wage might be extracted from the pub
lic treasury without protest were list
ed indefinitely as "laborers." Nor did
this statement create any surprise. In
the very general and interesting dis
cussion that followed it was admitted
by the old members that this condition
was a matter of common knowledge.
Like the tolerance for the superannu
ated clerks, it was a custom that had
grown, and no man â or at least no
Congressâ had been brave enough to
say "Xo" to it. But the resolution
passed, and, not only that, the subject
has been kept alive ever since by reso
lutions of Inquiry, protests on the part
of the heads of departments as to their
lack of knowledge in the premises or
belief in the allegations. However, it
is likely that the carriage bill will be
greatly reduced this year and that
coachmen will be a drug in the mar
ket.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. FEBRUARY IB. li>04.
BOTKIN TRIAL
IS POSTPONED
Disirict Attorney- Byington
3Iakes a Proper Showing and
Judge Grants a Continuance
FILES HIS AFFIDAVIT
Court Is Assured Witnesses
for Prosecution Outside the
State Will Be Here March 10
Judge Cook did not carry out his
threat to dismiss the case of Mrs. Cor
delia Botkin, charged with the mur
der of Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Dunning,
yesterday, but continued- the case
till March 10, when it is expected that
the witnesses in Delaware and other
Eastern States will be present.
The defendant was in court, looking
plump and self-possesled. She was
accompanied by her sister and when
she entered she smilingly shook hands
with her attorneys, George A. Knight
and Frank McGowan. She appeared
to take a keen interest in the pro
ceedings and when the case was con
tinued she engaged in earnest conver
sation for some minutes with her at
torneys. Detectives Kd Gibson and
Whi taker were in court, prepared to
rearrest her should the case be dis
missed.
STATE ASKS CONTINUANCE.
When the case was called Attorney
Knight, for the defendant, said he was
ready to proceed with the trial. Dis
trict Attorney Byington said he was
not ready, owing to the absence of
witnesses outside of this State. He
asked for a continuance till March 15,
when he hud every assurance that
these witnesses would be here, and he
hoped the defendant's attorneys would
offer no objection. He had spoken to
Attorney Knight about two weeks ago
on the subject and Knight had stated
that he was agreeable to a continu
ance. He would ask Knight now if
he would consent to the trial going
over till March 15.
Knight replied that he was ready
for trial and if the District Attorney
desired a continuance he should make
a showing either by affidavits or by
witnesses. It might be that the Dis
trict Attorney would never get the wit
nesses here. He would like the Dis
trict Attorney to show what diligence
he had used and what prospect there
was of getting the witnesses here at
all. A bill had been introduced in
the Legislature of Delaware to provide
for the expense of the prosecution 61
this case, but it had failed to pass.
Now the question was, would he ever
get them here. If the defense had
asked for a continuance the District
Attorney would have insisted upon an
affidavit.
"Not if I had agreed two weeks ago
to a continuance," retorted the Dis
trict Attorney.
"The District Attorney forgets," said
Knight, "that there is such a thing as
a misunderstanding. I do not desire
to bandy words with the District At
torney."
MAKES LEGAL SHOWING.
The District Attorney said he would
make a legal showing. He read an
affidavit by himself, reciting what had
been done in the case since its incep
tion and showing that witnesses ma
terial to the prosecution, T. M. Gooden,
Harry C. Pennington, Leila Deane,
Josephine Bateman, Ethel J. Milling
ton, Joshua D. Deane, Dr. Lemuel H.
Bishop, Dr. P. S. Downs, Dr. T. L.
Wolfe, B. J. McVey and John P. Dun
ning, were all outside this State; that
without these witnesses the prosecu
tion was not ready to go to trial, as
Harry C. Pennington would prove the
receipt of the box of poisoned candy,
Leila Deane and others would prove
that Mrs. Dunning died from arsenical
poison caused by eating the candy and
John P. Dunning would prove a mo
tive; that he had every reason to be
lieve these witnesses would be ready
for the trial from communications that
bad passed between him and Attorney
General Ward of Delaware; that on
February 7 he had been advised that
Downs and Wolf wanted $1000 each be
sides their expenses and others wanted
amounts aggregating $2000 more; that
although the bill providing for the ex
penses of the witnesses had failed to
pass the Delaware Legislature, Attor
ney General Ward had assured him
that all the witnesses would be here
by March 15; that Attorney Knight
had told him' about February 1 that
he wanted the Coroner at Dover, Del.,
subpenaed for the defense and Knight
was then informed that the case would
have to be postponed and Knight had
expressed his willingness for a con
tinuance and finally it was necessary
that the trial be postponed so as to
bring the perpetrator of one of the most
atrocious and diabolical crimes in the
history of this State to Justice.
"All that is shown there," said
Knight, "is that somebody has to guar
antee $4000 to compensate the wit
nesses."
CAN MAKE CONTRACTS.
The Judge said there was no question
but that the District Attorney had pow
er to make any and all necessary con
tracts for the prosecution of crime
There was no way of forcing these
witnesses to be here. The matter was in
the hands of the District Attorney and
the Board of Supervisors must pay the
bill. It was apparent that the District
Attorney did not know until a recent
date that it was necessary to enter into
such contracts, and now the only ques
tion was what length of time would be
required to get the witnesses here.
Knight asked if the District Attorney
would agree to pay $1000 compensation
to the witness for the defense.
The Judge replied that the District
Attorney had no power to make any
contract except for the prosecution. The
defense could take the deposition of an
absent witness, which was not allowed
the prosecution.
PREFERS LIVE WITXKSS.
Knight said he would prefer a live
witness to a piece of paper, particularly
In a murder trial. He asked for an
early hearing.
"If the State paid for the Coroner to
come here," said the District Attorney,
"would the defense allow the evidence
of Downs, Wolf and McVey given at
the former trial to be read as deposi
tions?"
"Certainly not," replied Knight.
"Their testimony is not worth anything
now. Whv, McVey dare not come, as
he has not enough money to repay the
money he borrowed from detectives
while he was here."
"I will be prepared to meet you at the
trial," retorted Byington, "in regard to
McVey or any of the witnesses."
The Judge suggested that the Dis
trict Attorney might bring the Coroner
here as one of his witnesses. There was
no other way to get his testimony ex
cept by deposition.
Byington suggested that Knight pre
pare interrogatories, but Knight said
he would not fight the District Attor
ney on paper.
After further discussion the Judge
said he was satisfied the District Attor
ney had made a showing for a reason
able continuance, and^set the case for
trial on March 10, the defense taking
an exception. ;â ? ,": >:
WOMAN WITNESS EXPOSES
PLAN OF LOTTERY GRAFT
Mrs. Mamie J. /Patten, Who Furnished Biank Tickets
Through Which Local Concern Was Victimized, With
stands Severe Examination â V. Torres Has Experience
Mrs. Mamie J. Patten was an all-star
witness in Judge Conlan's court yes
terday. She is the woman that tipped
off the identity of George Schubach
and William J. Holmes,. who are ac
cused of securing $7500 from Louis
Metzger on a bogus lottery ticket."
According to Mrs. Patten's admission
she stole between fifty and one hundred
blank tickets from a St. Louis engrav
ing firm, by whom she. was employed
as a typewriter. These she claims she
gave to Holmes, who, on one of them,
filled in the blank space for numbers
with the figures corresponding to those
that won the capital prize. With due
diligence he took the bogus ticket to
the lottery company's office and se
cured a check for $7500 in return.
The check was cashed by the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank, and New York ex
change was given for $5000 of the
amount. The remainder was paid in
cash.
Shubach claims to have been an in
nocent party to the transaction, having
formed Holmes' acquaintance on a
train coming from Portland. The ticket
was represented to him to be genuine
and he cashed the draft. He admits
having received some of the money.
Mrs. Patten told a different story.
She said she-had known both Schubach
and Holmes in St. Louis, where they
both occupied the same office. Holmes,
she said, was in the habit of paying
her $10 a week to keep him supplied
with blank lottery sheets and on three
occasions when Holmes "was absent
from the city Shubach paid her the
money.
Attorney Samuel Shortridge tried
to break down her testimony. She
never varied in her statements, and the
harder she was pressed the more shÂ«
disclosed *>f a criminal nature against
the defendant.
"Do you kno\p where Holmes is?"
asked Attorney Shortridge.
"I understand he's in Mexico," she
answered.
Further hearing of the case will be
continued to-day.
Lorenzo Abbugi, a native oÂ£ Venioe
and a sightless mendicant, was before
Judge Conlan yesterday on a charge of
begging.- He will be sent'^o the Alms
house if his friends do not take care*of
him. Clerk Jack Rice said he was a
Venetian blind, and narrowly escaped a.
commitment for contempt.
Vincent Torres, a Porto Rican, re
cently .returned from Honolulu, had the
time of his life Sunday night in a res
taurant on Montgomery avenue. He
went in there to order a plate of mut
ton stew, and as he spoke badly shat
tered English the waiter brought him
corned beef and refused to exchange it.
Torres wouldn't eat the corn be$f, and
to spur up his appetite the waiter
poured a cup of hot tea down the Porto
Rican's back and shampooed him with
the contents of a catsup bottle.
The waiter then barred Torres' exit
with a club and frightened the Porto
Rican so badlv that he seized a couple
of bottles of catsup and fought his way
to liberty.
A policeman rushed to the scene and
found Torres dripping with catsup
from every pore. Hastily bidding a by
stander to watch the dying man he
broke into the restaurant in search of
the murderer. A terrible scene met his
gaze. Catsup was spattered on the
walls and floor and ceiling. It looked
worse than a slaughter-house.
When the policeman found that Tor
res was sound of limb and skin he took
him to jail for disturbing the peace.
Judge Mogan heard the story yester
day and dismissed the defendant.
Francis Rab, a French sailor, and Jo
seph Henry, a colored "pussun," were
before Judge Mogan yesterday on the
charge of battering each other Sunday
morning. Henry claimed that Rab had
forcibly tried to walk between himself
arid his friend, Mistah Johnsing, while
they were peacefully sauntering down
Pacific street. To have allowed this
would have meant bad luck for seven
years and precluded the least chance
for him to make a natural even with
loaded dice.
He admitted attacking Rab and
shortly thereafter he wished he
hadn't. When the police arrived on
the scene the French sailorman was
everlastingly lambasting the two ne
groes. Mistah Johnsing managed to
make a get-away, but Rab and Henry
were arrested. Judge Mogan dis
missed Rab off the reel, but continued

Harry Waidlich, who is charged
with the murder of Pius Liquer, was
before Judge Mogan yesterday and
was instructed and arraigned. A state
ment was made to the court showing
that the killing was more 'in the shape

this showing the bail was fixed at
$2000, which was furnished last even

MUNICIPALITY
WINS VICTORY
San Mnteo Branch of United
Railroads Must Be Assessed
by the Different Counties
JUSTICES CHANGE MIXDS
Supreme Court Deals a Hard
Blow to the Corporations
and Board of Equalization
The Supreme Court has reversed
itself in the case brought by the San
Francisco and San Mateo Electric Rail
way Company against ex-Tax Collector
Ecott and now the corporation's prop
erty will be assessed by the authorities
cr the counties through which the line
runs instead of by the State Board of
Equalization. The Justices who
changed their minds are Shaw. Angel
lÂ«.tti, Lorigan and Van Dyke. San
Francisco will gain about S50W annually
as a result of the court's decision.
This particular difficulty between the
city authorities and the San Mateo line
people arose in 1R99. prior to the^ pui
chase of the property by the United
Railroads. The corporation sought to
restrain thp Assessor, the Tax Collector
and the Auditor from taking the official
stand that thÂ» San Mateo line property
within the limits of San Francisco
thould be taxed by this municipality.
It was maintained by the attorneys for
the company that the State Board of
Equalization should make the assess
ment and that th? two counties con
cerned should get taxes in proportion
to the number of miles of roadbed in
each.
The judgment of the Superior Court
was in favor of the city. The Supreme
Court on appeal decided in favor of the
corporation. A- rehearing was granted.
The decision Just rendered sustains the
Judgment of the Superior Court. The
Lnited Railroads is expected to file a
petition for another hearing.
DISCI SS .MEANING OF WORD
The main question in dispute was a?
to the meaning of the word "railroads"
in the constitution. The article on
which the corporation relied to prove
its case is as follows:
All property, except as hereinafter in this
section provided. 5hall b<? as B sef>Â«fd in the coun
ty, ritv and county. city. township cr
district in which it is situated, in the man
r-r pr*scrihÂ»c1 by law. The franchise, road
Â»sy. rca'fT.vd. rails an<l railing stork of all
railraads rperated in mor* than one county in
this Erate chall be assessed by the State Board
(f Equalization at their actual valu-. and the
tarne shall be apr/Ttioned f .o the counties, cities
End countlÂ«"*. fities. towns, townships and dis
tricts in whirh said railroads are Irx-at^ in
proportion to the number of miles of railway
laid in tuch counties, cities, cities and coun
ti<=F. trwns. townships and districts.
The railroad company argued that the
law applied to inter-county street rail
ways. The city authorities held a con
trary view. The court says that the
question of motive power has nothing
to do with the matter. It must be
Ehown that the framers of the law
either did or did not have street rail
ways in mind when they made the
measure a part of the constitution. The
court says that the context shows they
did not. The purpose of the provision
was to prevent conflicts between coun
ties by having one body make the
whole assessment.
FRANCHISES ARE DIFFERENT.
The franchises of steam and electric
railroads are different. The last named
are for use in the streets of cities and
towns. The former are intended to
stop at more or less widely separated
pftints. The franchise of a street rail
road is more of a "local" affair. The
court holds that it would thus be an
anomalous condition of affairs if the
franchise granted by one municipality
Fhould benefit another local govern
ment.
It is said that Los Angeles might
have a great system of railroads. The
line might run for thirty miles within
the county, and then a short spur track
might be- built into another county. The
State Board of Equalization would
make an average valuation and appor
tion the taxes. Los Angeles would have
by far the-most valuable portion of the
road, but would pet taxes only in pro
portion to the > miles of track within her
confines.
The court says in conclusion that
there are n^w beintj constructed some
"hybrid" roads, whirh are like street
railways in the city and like steam rail
roads in the country. These are except
ed in the decision.
The San Mater, line has a trifle more
than eighteen miles of track in San
Francisco. The road is assessed at a
valuation of J13S.O00 a mile.
The opinion i.Â« written by Justice
Shaw, -with whom Justices Lorigan. An
gcllotti, Vin Dyke and Chief Justice
Beatty directly concur. Justices Mc-
Farland and Hmshaw adhore to their
previous attitude in the^jnatter. Chief
Justice Beatty raised the Â«;nly dissent
ing voice when thfÂ» case was previously
d*cSd<Ki in favur of the corporation.

STARS APPEAR
IN TRAGEDY
Warde and James Represent
3Iarc Antony and Brutus, Re
spectively, in "Julius Caesar"
RECEIVE 3IUCH APPLAUSE
Alcazar Troupe Well Cast in
"The Charity J5all"-"The
Men of Jimtown"- at Central
Warde and James triumphed at the
Columbia Theater last evening, despite
a paucity of accessories that was pain
fully marked and amid anachronisms
that were rather more calculated to up
set the gravity of the audience than to
inspire the dignity that properly at
tends the performance of a Shakes
pearean tragedy. The support was not
Shakespearean. Therefore all the more
marked was the. superiority of Warde
and James, and the greater, necessarily,
was the merit that kept up a sufficient
semblance of reality to provoke 'the
audience to genuine enthusiasm.
The play was "Julius Caesar," and
Warde was Marc Antony and James
was Brutus. Warde played the role
that was his with enough of subtle sug
gestion to make a marked hit in the
oration over the body of Julius Caesar.
Indeed, the audience had the curtain
rung up half a dozen times, and would
not be contented until Warde came for
ward and made a speech, in which he
spoke of the pleasure it gave him to
iind in these modern days the love of
Shakespeare had not died among those
who could understand and appreciate.
Later on James, after the ghostly ap
parition of Caesar at Philippi, was sim
ilarly complimented. He spoke very
briefly. James' Brutus was character
ized by dignity and finish throughout.
His natural physical endowments add
ed to the measure of his success very
materially.
Thomas Coffin Cooke played the small
part of Julius Caesar. Norman Hackett
essayed the role of Cassius. Somewhat
inclined to tear a passion to tatters, he
nevertheless .made a good scene of the
yuarrel with Brutus and came in for a
large share of applause. "The remainder
of the cast does not deserve serious
mention from the point of Shake
spearean presentation with the exception
of Miss Sumner in the one-scene part
of Calphurnia, and more noticeably
Aphie James as Lucius, which role she
made acceptable for picturesqueness
and fidelity.
There is no desire to detract from
the applause that was won on merit by
James and Warde, but if Shakespeare
is to be enjoyed thoroughly at the Co
lumbia there is need of furbishing up
and providing more ample accessories.
Imagine, for instance, the Senate house
where Caesar is slain having only just
enough of size to seat Caesar and the
few Senators who took part in the as
sassination. Then consider the unities
in the light of the fact that when
Caesar enters the Senate house the or
chestra is playingâ what? Xot any tri
umphal march of old times, but just
the plain, every day "Hail to the Chief"
â dear to the hearts of small beer pol
iticians, when they are on the circuit,
barnstorming in half a score of As
sembly districts per night, but decided
ly incongruous when introduced in an
cient Rome in the time of its greatness.
The Roman armies were but a platoon.
Hackett has a bad trick of twiddling
his fingers incessantly' on the hem of
his Roman top;a when he is supposed
to be greatly excited or. enraged. The
effect may be intended to indicate
Roman anger, but in modern times it
has the general suggestion of an in
satiate violinist, who is performing long
trills on imaginary and inaudible vio
lin strings. It is a good trick to cut
out of the performance, unless it is ths
only way Hackett has to show that
h< is perturbed.
The rain kept many away, undoubted
ly, but there was still a large enough
audience to show interest in the trag
edy and the people who were perform
ing in it. The student rlas?, young
men and women from educational in
stitutions, who are engaged in studying
in English courses, were numerously, in
evidence.
Alcazar.
The Alcazar players gave an artistic
initial production of "The Charity Ball"
last night and thoroughly demonstrated
their respective dramatic capabilities in
the parts assigned to them. Conspicu
ous work was done by James Durkin,
who gave a strong- impersonation of
John Van -Buren, the rector. Luke Con
ness played Dick Van Buren with intel
ligence and won thi- good graces of his
audience, when, at the earnest solicita
tion of his brother, the rector, he agreed
to make the woman he had wronged
his wife. John BJ Maher was perfectly
at home as Judge Knux and was made
up to puzzle his most intimate friends â
no small talent in the art of an actor.
George Qsbourne played Franklin Cru
ger with a finesse all his own and
Harry H. Hilliard was refreshing as
Alec Robinson, a plunger in a small
way. Walter Belasco does a fine bit of
character a.s Mr. Uetts, the old organ
ist, and shows ina'rked improvemant in
his work. The ladies of the company
are well cast and effectively aid in the
success of the production. They dis
play several stunning gowns that are
at once a delight and a charm to the
beholderp. Miss Eleanor Gordon plays
Phyllis Lee in a manner to win com
mendation, but should not allow her
emotion to interfere with her enuncia
tion, as it did in the third act. Adele
Block is gentle and womanly as Ann
Cntger and Frances Starr is delightful
as Boss Van Btircn. The list would not
be complete without a mention of Marie
Howe, who is admirable as the blind
mother.
Chutes.
There is a varied and entertaining
j programme at the Chutes this week,
j including Kelly and Violet, the "fash
j Ion plate singing duo"; Irving Jones
j the diminutive colored individual, who
writes his own songs; Hanlon and Zan

Central.
The audience that filled the Central
Theater last night got the worth of its
money in the wild west excitement
The attraction is a new border drama
'The Men of Jimtown," and the scenes
are laid in the Cherokee strip in Okla
homa. The men. with the exception of
the necessary brace. of villains, arc all
brave and daring, rough and Teckless
while the women, as a rule, are para
gons of their sex. The play teems with
thrilling incidents. It starts out with
an express robbery, and after a raid on
the Jimtown bank, a locomotive race in
full sight of the audience and a Jury
trial governed by frontier rules, winds
up with a Fourth of July celebration.
The story is that of a telegraph oper-

DUKE OF NORFOLK WEDS
GWENDOLYN MAXWELL
Distinguished Member of the English Aristocracy Marries
j His Cousin, the Eldest Daughter of Lord Herres, in
Presence of Friends, and Couple Receive Costly Gifts
THE PREMIER DUKE AND EARL
OF ENGLAND AND THE NEW
DUCHESS.
LONDON, Feb. 15.â The Duke of Nor
folk and the Hon. Gwendolyn Mary
Maxwell, eldest daughter of Lord Her
res. were married to-day in the Roman
Catholic church at Everingham.
The ceremony, which for various
causes, had been four times postponed,
was very quiet, the only guests being
near relatives, the tenantry of the
Duke and a few personal friends.
Costly presents were given to the
bride and bridegroom, including gifts
from King Edward, Queen Alexandra
and numerous others. . The Duke of
Norfolk presented to the town of Shef
field a public park in commemoration
ot the wedding.
The Duke of Norfolk is nearly double
the age of his bride, who is his first
cousin once removed.
He was born in 1847 and is therefore
in his fifty-seventh year. The Duke
was first married in 1877 and his wife
died ten years afterward.
He had an only child, a son, who was
born in 1879. From his birth the son
was afflicted and his father made pil
grimages to Rome and Lourdes and
sacred shrines in the hope that the lad
could be cured through spiritual chan
nels, but without ayail.
Like most of his ancestors the Duke
is a most devoted Catholic and was.
held in the very highest esteem by the
late Pontiff Leo XIII. . . .
According to Burke's ' Peerage the
ducal and illustrious house of Norfolk
stands next to the blood royal at the
head of the peerage of England. He is
the premier Duke and -hereditary Earl
Marshal of England. He is^at the head
of the College of Arms or. Herald's Of
fice and has the direction of- all cere
monial matters appertaining to corona
tions, proclamations of war and peacÂ»,
royal funerals and all other great state
functions.
The dukedom of Norfolk was founded
in 1483. and the first who bore the titlp
was the "Jockey of Norfolk" of
Shakespeare and Richard III, who was
an active, ambitious soldier. He '.vas
killed with his sovereign, the crookback
Richard, at the battle of Bosworth
Field, Aueust. 22. 1485.
The three next of his line were ex
ecuted in Tower Hill and the fourth
ator who "borrows" $40,000 from the
man who robbed him of a valuable in
ventionâthe money being removed
from an express train without the for
mality of a permit. The yoftng man
then goc-s down to Oklahoma, grows up
with the country, becomes rich, pays
the money back and marries the girl
who designedly misled the pursuers at
the time of the express robbery. Her
schel Mayall as the versatile hero was
handsome, dashing and able.- Henry
Shumer delighted his admirers in a ro
bust comedy part, and Elmer Booth
made a very acceptable Hebrew. Edwin
T. Emery was the villain of the piece.
Eugenia "Thais Lawton as the heroine
proved herself an expert bicyclist in
one of the sensational scenes, and Myr
tle Vane makes the most of a soubrette
role.

The family of Lord Herres, to which
the Duchess-elett belongs, was long: fa
mous for Its devotion to the Catholic
cause and the house of Stewart. The
Lord Herres of the day was the pas
sionate adherent of Mary Queen cf
Scots and was her sole companion of
rank in her closing days in Scotland.
He begged her on his knees not to take
the fatal step of throwing herself into
the cruel hands of Queen Elizabeth.
The Lord Herres of 1715 took the field
for the old pretender and was taken
fighting sword in hand at Preston. His
Lordship had been created Earl of
Nithsdale. He was sent to the tower,
tried by his peers and left for execu
tion. The evening before the execution
Lady Nithsdale visited her husband in
his cell. She dressed him in her own
skirt, cloak and hood and he, holding
a handkerchief to his face as if weep

France, where he and his brave Coun

Jnd<i:o Morrow Decides Thai
Oral Contracts Cannot Be
Proved 'by Parole Kvidcjicc
The life of the celebrated $5,000,000
suit brought in the United Statoi Cir
cuit Court by the Utah-Nevuda Com
pany against Joseph R. de Lnmur wuÂ«
Very short. Judge Morrow announced
yesterday that he would suntfiln iho
objection of the defendant to thp tcÂ»
timony of Isaac E. Blake with n-fnrcmao
to an alleged oral agreement between
himself and De Lamar on April J, 1M4,
hy the terms or which De Lamjir wnÂ«
to work the Jim Crow, and Monitor
dump mines, in Lincoln County, Neva
da, on which Blake had an option, nnd
to give Blake 49 per cent of the net
profits. The defendant objected to the
admission of parole testimony with ref
erence to this transaction on the ground
that an oral contract for the transfer
of realty could not be proved by parole
testimony and would be of no valufil
Blake alleged that De Lamar had
himself stated that he had taken $13,
000,000 from the mines, of which about
$10,000,000 was net profit. '
Judge Morrow instructed the jury to
return a verdicts for the defendant
which they did. and Blake must seek
some other means of getting the $5,000,
000. An appeal will be taken.
A similar suit was filed yesterday in
the Superior Court.

the time of the adjournment spoke in
praise of the life work of Mr. Foote.
EULOGY BY HANLON.
Charles F. Hanlon. the attorney, ap
peared before Judge Coffey of the Su
perior Court yesterday morning and
made a brief address on the life and
work of W. W. Foote, the dead lawyer.
He said:
It Is with feeling of profound grief that I
rise to announce to this honorable court and Its
officers the news of the somewhat sudden death
of one of the most prominent members of the
bar of this court, the Hon. William W. Focte.
Although Mr. Foote had during the last year
somewhat failed in health, it was hoped that
his constitution, which was of Iron; his phy
sique, which was Herculean, and his courage,
which was unconquerable, would continue long
in the future to carry, him In that same illus
trious .career which, commencing thirty-five
years ago. will now serve to brilliantly reflect
his name in the legal constellation of departed
worth. But the ways of the Almighty are in
scrutable.
A cold, contracted a week ago, terminated
en last Saturday, the 13lhinst., after a few
days of bedridden illness, in the death of Mr.
Foote at the residence of the Hon. J. V. Cole
man in this city.
Mr. William W. Foote, as your Honor is al
ready aware, belonged to that old school of
great lawyers that reared California from total
oblivion In such a wonderful, such a masterly
manner to the very front rank In American Ju
risprudence and American civilization.
It required cuch a body of great lawyers as
that old school', contained to fan the sacred
flame of the laws of a new State, which, dif
ferent to all her sister States, sprang at onee
Into matured statehood as Minerva uprang
armed and equipped from the brain of al
mighty Jove, and which then outstripped her
older Bister StatÂ»s in the fashioning and crys
tallizing of laws second to none among the en
lightened powers of the earth.
. That Mr. Foote by his learning, his elo
quence, his honesty, his good faith, his sin
cerity and his great force, assisted conspicu
ously in the work of this great school at the
San Francisco bar, oun recent, as well as our
older annals, bear singularly convincing testi
mony.
I now, on behalf of the entire bar of this
honorable court, the scene of some of his
greatest triumphs, move an adjournment out
of respect for the memory of the late William
W. Foote. as well as out of sorrow and sympa
thy for the members of his bereaved family;
and I further move that a copy of this reso
lution be spread on the minutes of this honor
able ,coutt and that a certified copy .thereof be
sent to the family of our depaÂ¥ted brother, j
' A SAD AUDIENCE.
Jammed to overflowing, the rooms
in the house 6T J. V. Coleman were
filled with a sad and silent audience.
The services . were brief and unosten
tatious. The Rev. William Carson
Shaw of Oakland delivered the funeral
sermon; At the conclusion the Lord's
Prayer was said in unison by the as
stmblage and by the request of the
family the remains were not exposed
to view.
Prominent 'men from all over the
State were present and those friends
who were unable to attend sent beauti
ful floral pieces. The room in which
the coffin stood was filled to overflow
ing with the tributes of loving friends.
Governor Pardee sent a floral tribute.
The body was taken to the Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery and cremated. The
ashes will be conveyed to Mountain
View Cemetery in Oakland. wHere
they will be interred privately beside
those of Mrs. W. W. Foote, who died
in Hongkong four years ago.
The honorary pallbearers were:
James V. Coleman, Frank J. Moffitt,
Judge Frederick W. Henshaw, T. T.
Dargie, A. A. Moore, Dr. E. H. Wool-

MOURNED IX OAKLAND.
OAKLAND. Feb. 15:â The Superior
courts of Alameda County adjourned
to-day out of respect to the memory
of \V. W. Foote, who was a well
known practitioner at the Alameda
bar. Sitting in bank to-day Judges
TOIlsworth, Hall. Greene and Ogden
listened to a eulogy delivered by Mel

an Hoquent tribute to his dead friend.
He said:

COUNTERFEITER
RUN TO EARTH
Andreas "Winkelmann, "Who
Professed to Lead Christian
Life, Behind Bars of City Jail
DUAL CAREER IS ENDED
Employed During the Day as
a Draughtsman, and at Night
Manufactures Spurious Coin
Draughtsman by day and counter
feiter by night has been the dual. life
led by Andreas Winkelmann, taken
into custody last night bv Secret # Ser
vice Operatives Hazen, McManus and
Foster and lodged in the City Prison.
Secreted In his room at 1415 Polk
street, where the arrest was made, was
found a complete plant for the manu
facture of counterfeit half-dollars and
more than $200 of the' bogus coin.
Winkelmann, who is a member of the
Young Men's Christian Association of
this city, has been under surveil
lance 'for ten days and moved to the
Polk-street address two days ago. He
has beerTemployed by Sylvain Schnait
tacher, a well-known architect, as a
draughtsman, and among his acquain
tances bore an excellent reputation.
Several weeks ago Secret Service
Agent Hazen was told that a number
of skillfully made counterfeit half-dol
lars had appeared in the city. The
Government detectives were at once
put to work and finally succeeded in
obtaining a clew to the identity of the
counterfeiter. It was deemed inadvis
able to make the arrest until the plant
could be seized and accordingly every
move made by Winkelmann during the
last ten days has been watched.
Saturday Winkelmann secured the
room on Polk street, but there was
nothing in his demeanor to arouse sus
picion. A trunk which appeared to be
very heavy was delivered by an ex
pressman. The Government officers
determined to raid the room and ac
cordingly swooped d6wn on the place
last night. Winkelmann was found in
the apartment and placed under arrest.
The trunk was opened and was f ound
to contain everything essential for the
manufacture of the spurious coin and
400 bogus half dollars in various stages
of completion.
Winkelmann, who is a German,
about 27 years of age, has resided in
this city for two years. He says that
three years ago he inherited 10,000
marks as his share of a sister's estate.
He journeyed from his German home
to Mexico and there squandered all of
his coin in high living. He became a
member of the Young Men's Christian
Association last year and regularly at
tended the night classes in mechanical
drawing. Secret Service Agent Hazen
said that W T inkelmann had displayed
great skill in the manufacture of the
spurious coin and. that the molds and
metal used showed ingenuity and ap
plication.
BONDED WAREHOUSE
LOSES ITS FRANCHISE
South End Company Accused of Hav
ing Repeatedly O'vercliarjred Pa-
trons and Must Close.
Advices ' were Â« received in this city
yesterday to the effect that the Secre
tary of the Treasury had decided to re
voke the franchise of the South End
Bonded Warehouse Company. It is al
leged that this concern has been mak
ing exorbitant charges and that a num
ber of complaints have been filed with
Collector Stratton.
William T. Lemman. vice president
of the company, when interviewed re
garding the matter last night, said:
"This comes as a surprise to me. I
had never heard of any complaints be
ing filed with Mr. Stratton and he never
intimated to us that our methods of
doing business were unsatisfactory.
We have had, like all other business
men, some protests regarding charges,
but these have always been amicably
adjusted.
"I have no idea who could have made
the complaint, as our relations with
our rivals, our and the Col
lector of the Port have always been
friendly."
Fonnd With Legs Broken.
Andrew Hagmann, a carpenter," resid
ing at 2020 Twenty-third street, was
found near his home yesterday with
both legs broken. It is thought he was
run over by a wagon while intoxicated.

SENATOR MARCUS HANNA ANSWERS SUMMONS OF DEATH
AFTER A BRAVE BATTLE THAT AMAZED MEDICAL MEN
End Is Peaceful in
Nation's Capi
tal.
Wife of Lawmaker
Absent at Final
Moment.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.â Senator
Marcus Alonzo Hanna died at 6:40
o'clock tc-nlght at the family apart
ments in the Arlington Hotel, after an
illness extending over nearly two
months, filled with apparent recoveries
followed by relapses, and finally drift
ing into typhoid fever, which in his
weakened condition he was unable to
withstand.
When the end came all the members
of the Senator's family were in the
room except Mrs. Hanna. the Senator's
wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Dan Hanna.
Mrs. Hanna had left the room only a
fow minutes before.
The last sinking spell began at ex
actly 6:30 o'clock. Drs. Carter and Os-
Jpr were then in attendance. They did
not conceal the fact that life was about
to end. and all the members of the
family were sent for. Mrs. McCor
rr.ick, one of the tonator's daughters,
ar.d Miss Phelps were present when
the end came. Mr. and Mrs. Dan Han
na were the first to arrive and Â©iey
withdrew immediately to the chamber
of the Senator's wife to summon her
to the bedside. It was while they were
absent that the Senator breathed his
last.
There were no distressing incidents
attending the last moments. It was
a sinking spell which terminated in ten
minutes. Just after his eyes closed in
death Mrs. Hanna was able to come
into the room. She bore up well under
the ordeal, and to-night she is showing
calmness ana bravery.
MRS HAXXA COURAGEOUS.
The courage which had been dis
played by Mrs. Hanna was the sub
ject of the greatest surprise. She had
been In almost constant attendance on
her husband, though realizing fully
that there was no hope of recovery.
Nevertheless, the remonstrances of the
physicians and the added implorings
of her children that she take some rest
were unavailing until late in the after
noon, when she was attacked by a vio
lent headache." She was given a nar
cotic, and then she retired to her cham
ber, but requested that a call be sent
2s ponn as there appeared any change
for the worse. ,
For the last two days Senator Hanna
has net been conscious except at in
tervals, and then only to obey mechan
ically some instructions given him by
Thr physicians. Fourteen hours before
the end was announced life had prac-
Ucallj suspended, the flickering spark
being kept aglow by the most powerful
scientific agencies.
Word of the Senator's death went
over the hotel like a flash. The lobby
was crowded, and a score of friends
were waiting in Mr. Dover's room. No
attempts were made to restrain grief.
Senator! Fairbanks, Scott and Kit*
titdge broke down. General Dick wept
his sorrow at the loss of a friend who
had been almost a brother. So it was
that conversations were a curious ad
mixture of whispers and choked sobs.
NOTABLE MEX MOURX.
Spontaneously outbursts of unstinted
t:ibute were heard on every side. Men
who are acknowledjred leaders of po
litical parties, kings of finance and
commerce and men selected to serve in
the highest positions in the nation
were among those who expressed th-i
country's immeasurable loss.
Funeral services will be held In the
Senate chamber Wednesday at noon,
at which the President, Cabinet, Con
press, public officials and friends will
!>e present. For a brief period in the
forenoon the body will lie in stat* in
the marble room. After the services
special trains over the Pennsylvania
Railway will carry the body, the fam
ily ar.d friends to Cleveland, where
services will be hfld either at the home
of the Senator or his son, Dan Hanna,
on Friday afternoon. It is likely that
Bishop Leonard of the Northern Dio
cese of Ohio of thÂ« Episcopal Church
and formerly rector of St. John's
Church in this city, will conduct the
cervices.
Senators and Representatives visited
the hotel throughout the evening- ami
many cf the dead man's friends were
admitted to the death chamber.
The last intelligible words spoken
by Senator Hanna were pathetic in his
attempt to maintain to the last the
humor which was characteristic of his
life. Yesterday morning he moved bis
head slightly and his eyes a little. The
nurse asked if he was looking fcr his
handkerchief.
'"I think my wife has my handker
chief," the Senator whispered.
DEATH MASK IS TAKEN.
Members of the family when told
of the remark at once recognized it
as one of his favorite rejoinders in
good-natured plaguing In which Mr.
and Mrs. Hanna often indulged. It
was the Senator's custom when he
missed any personal article, especially
his handkerchief, to say:
â¢'I expect my wife has it"
At about 11 o'clock yesterday the
Senator became unconscious and the
patient did not seem to know what
W2.3 groing on about him. When it
eras known that there was no chance
for recovery arrangement was made
to have a death mask taken by Sculp
tor U. S. J. Dunbar and that was done
early this evening. The cast will be
perfect, and, strange as it may seem,
will show the face in its usual full
ness. The Senator's face shows little
emaciation, and, owing to the con
stant use of oxygen, had taken on
what appeared to be a coat of tan.
â¢which gave it almost a life-like ap
pearaneo.
Gathered in the office room, where
Senator Hanna so often had occupied
n desk dictating campaign correspond
ence, at the time of his death were
Postmaster General Payne, who was
*ilso associated with Mr. Hanna as
vice chairman of the national com
mittee; Governor Herrick, Represen
tative Dick of Ohio and a host of
others associated with Mr. Hanna po
litically and personally. When the
death was announced to them there
was a moment of absolute silence.
"It la a great loss," murmured Qen-

eral Dick. Then Postmaster General
Payne rang the telephone, and, the
White House responding to his call, he
said:
"Senator Hanna has Just passed
away," thus conveying the news to
President and Mrs. Roosevelt.
A large number or messages were
sent out by the Hanna family and by
Governor Herrick announcing the
death. Throughout the evening there
was a steady stream of caller? and
messages of condolence. Secretary
Cortelyou, Speaker Cannon, Senator
Fairbanks of Indiana and John R. Mc-
Lean of Ohio being among the earliest
of those personally to offer their re
grets.
President Roosevelt called at the Ar
lington Hotel to-night personally to ex
press his condolence to the members of
the late Senator Hanna's family. The
President walked to the hotel unat
tended. Some consideration has been
given by the President and several
members of the Cabinet to the question
of accompanying the funeral party to
the place of Interment of the late Sen
ator's remains in Ohio. The matter,
however, is still undecided.
The flags on the Capitol will be at
half-mast to-morrow and remain so
until after the funeral. The desk of
Senator Hanna in the Senate chamber
will be draped in mourning. There will
be an official funeral in the Senate on
Wednesday, the body lying in state in
the Senate marble room in the morn
ing. It is expected that the Gridiron
Club quartet will participate In the ser
vices and sing the hymns. This will be
done on account of Senator Hanna's
intimate relations with the club. Hl3
last public appearance was at the an
nual Gridiron dinner.
It Is expected that three special trains
will go to Cleveland Wednesday morn
ing, one with the body, accompanied by
the Senator's family; another with the
Senators who will attend the funeral at
Cleveland, and another with the House
of Representatives committee.
SENATOR'S BRAVE FIGHT.
Physicians Say Resistance to the Dis-
ease Was Remarkable.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15. â Dr. E. P.
Carter of Cleveland, one of the attend
ing physicians, to-night made the fol
lowing statement regarding Mr. Han
na's Illness:
"Senator Hanna died quietly at
twenty minutes to 7 to-night." after a
most superb fight against a very vir
ulent attack of typhoid. The Senator
had not been well for some weeks,
but had been confined to his bed only
during the past fifteen days.
"From the early course of the dis
ease there was no evidence as to the
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY/ FEBRUARY 16, 1904.
intense severity of the infection, and
the outlook at first seemed bright.
Since Sunday, the 7th, the progress
of the fever became more marked,
there being a gradual rise in the tem
perature from day to day, and by
Wednesday the evidences of a severe
toxic condition were such as to make
the physicians in attendance anxious
as to the ultimate outcome, though,
counting somewhat on Mr. Hanna's
indomitable will, they continued to be
hopeful.
"The early inability to retain nour
ishment was finally overcome and the
case seemed to be progressing more
favorably, when on Friday last In the
afternoon the Senator had a severe
chill, a most unusual occurrence in
the course of typhoid. Following this
his temperature rose rapidly, reaching
105 that night, and the evidences of
profound toxemia were marked. Dur
ing the last days of Senator Hanna's
illness he was able to retain the nour-'
ishment given and" responded in a way
little short of marvelous to every
treatment which was resorted to,
rallying promptly from a serious col
lapse which at intervals followed the
chill of Friday. Saturday had been
such a favorable day that his physi
cians took courage and even then
hoped for a favorable outcome. The
change for the worse came early this
morning and was followed by a grad
ual failure of his strength, which al
ready had been overtaxed - by the
severity of the disease. His wonder
ful recuperative power was such that,
though the end had been expected at
almost any time during the early
hours of Monday he clung tenaciously
to life until to-night, when he suc
cumbed."
MASTERFUL LEADER OF MEN.
Popularity of Marcus A. Hanna Due
to His General Manner. -
"Mark" Hanna, as he was popularly
known, was one of the most unique
and forceful characters ever known in
American politics. He combined in his
personality many qualities which made
Caesar, MIrabeau and Napoleon great.
Though his first appearance In national
politics was in 1884, within a very few
years his name was oh every tongue
from Eastport. Maine, to San' Diego,
California, and he was recognized as
one of the "mighty men" of his party.
Without having done preliminary ser
vice in the minor places he became
United States Senator first by appoint
ment to a vacancy in 1897, and in, 1898
by election of his State Legislature.
All through sheer force of intrinric
merit as a. man of brains, Integrity and
forcefulness. ;
Hanna was born at Lisbon (then

New Lisbon), Columblana Cownty,
Ohio, September 24, 1837, in the. same
corner of the Buckeye State where John
Sherman, Garfield, and William McKin
ley first saw light. His father was
Leonard Hanna, one of the Virginia
Quakers who came to the Old Domin
ion in the early days. The Hannas for
generations: have been influential peo-.
pie in Shelby County, Kentucky Middle
Tennessee, New Orleans, Central Ar
kansas and Missouri. Air of these were
of the same stock from which Mark
Hanna sprung and of closer kin than
is reckoned near in . Scotland. His
mother was a Miss Converse, born in
Vermont, and a Presbyterian in reli
gion. ; .,' : i . : -.'.-:
PARENTS OF STATESMAN.
Of this peculiar : union pf cavalier-
Quaker on. the one side and New Eng
land Presbyterian on. the other came a
strong, . sagacious, , honest and master
ful leader of men, who for a full decade
past has been a fore figure in the coun
cils of his party and the halls of na
tional legislation.
His father was a physician and later
a merchant in Cleveland,- Ohky whither
the family removed : in 1852, â¢ when', the
population : was but 25,1)00. Leonard
Hanna, on going ;to * Cleveland,, em
barked in the -wholesale grocery busi-
ness as head of the firm of Hanna,
Garretson & Co.
' Young Mark, after going through the
public schools of Cleveland, entered the
employ of his father's firm, and on the
death of his father, in 1S62, assumed
control of the business. In 1S67 the
grocery firm was dissolved and he be
came a member of the firm of Rhodes
& Co. He had married in 1864 Miss
Augusta Rhodes, a daubhter of the
senior member of the firm, and on the
rettrement of Rhodes .in 18S7 became
the head- of the firm, which he reor
ganized under the name of M. A. Hanna
& Co., which position he held up to
the time. of his death.
In 1887 he organized and equipped the
Cleveland Transportation Company,
one of the largest lines operating on
the great lakes. On the organization
of the Union National Bank he was
elected its president. - All these enter
prises brought him good returns^and
Hanna was noted as a man of weaith
and resources long before he entered
public life. ,
Though always taking an active In
terest in' politics he made his debut on
the national carpet only in 1SS4, when
he was sent. as a delegate at large to
the Republican National Convention.
He went again as a district delegate iu
1883. A warm friend of Senator John
Sherman, he was a strong advocate for
his nomination for the Presidential
nomination and to the last thought that
Sherman's eminent services were never
adequately recognized.
Hanna was one of the men who ad
vanced the m^ans to relieve Mr. Me-
Kinley's financial embarrassment In
1S88. He took charge of his prelimin
ary campaign for the Presidency In
1895-96, and so well did he conduct It
that he was chosen chairman of the
national committee and given the en
tire conduct of the campaign, which he
carried to a successful Issue. He was
the central figure also In the campaign
for McKinley's re-election in 1900.
In 1885 President Cleveland appointed
Hanna to the very important position
o/ v one of the Government directors of
the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1S81
Hanna organized the West Republic
Mining Company of Marquette, Mich.,
becoming the president thereof. In
1882 he was elected to the presidency of
the Pacific Coal and Iron 4 Company of
St. Paul and later became president of
the Cleveland City Railway Company.
He organized and controlled many
other industries and enterprises, em
ploying at a late date as many as
10,090 men, and always sought and ob
tained the respect and friendship of his
men by dealing fairly with them. In
many years there was never a strike
In any, one of the great enterprises
wilh which he was connected or any
trouble of an aggravated character.
,' His prominence in his party in the
national hfllls of legislation, as a man
of large affairs and his efforts to bring
about amicable relations between labor
and capital, led to his selection as the
head of the momentous conference
lately held in New York City between
the representatives of the two sides of
the great question and to his being
made the head of the voluntary per
manent commission to arbitrate any
differences likely to arise between the
two.
Hanna's part in national affairs, both
domestic and foreign, Is a matter of
recent history, but it may be said that
his action was cogent and pronounced
and his motives of the highest order.
He was even tempered and never fret
ted about anything.
In his beautiful home Windemere.
on Lake avenue, In the west end of
Cleveland. Hanna lived, when not in
Washington, with his wife and two
children, Ruth and Mabel, an Ideal
happy American home life. His only
son, Daniel R. Hanna, married some
years ago and set up housekeeping for
himself. He entertained largely and
was a most hospitable but unostenta
tious host, though the family made no
pretensions to social leadership.
Hanna was not very pronounced In
his religious views. His wife is a con
sistent member of the Episcopal church
and he was a vestryman of their* par
ish, though not a communicant.
RELATIONS WITH McKJXLEY. *
His first meeting with William Mc-
Kinley was in an Ohio courtroom,
where a labor dispute wa; 1 ing tried,
and Mr. McKinley was the counsel on
the side opposed to Mr. Hanna. Mr.
Hanna was so Impressed with the
conduct of Mr. McKinley at that trial
that he sought the acquaintance of the
f-.ture Governor and future President,
and this acquaintance ripened into
war friendship.
Mr. Hanna's opportunity to make
Mr. McKinley the Presidential candi
date came four years later, In 1896.
Hanna began the wofrk of getting the
delegates for McKinley at least two
Pages 9 to KÂ£

Sympathy.

years In advance of the meeting of the
convention. "While other Presidential
aspirants and their friends were spec
ulating as to when would be the right
time to get to work Mr. Hanna called
a most important conference of admir
ers of McKinley at Thomasville. Ga.
Here the whole plan of the campaign
was mapped out. The conference in
cluded men from nearly every State In
the Union, and the South was strongly
represented. While Reed was busy in
Congress and Platt and Quay and
Clarkson were thinking of making a
combination some time in the future.
Hanna had started the movement that
was to overthrow all opposition and
place William McKinley in the WhitÂ»
House.
SUCCESS TO POLITICS.
With the election of McKinley cams
additional responsibilities to Mr. Han
na. He had to reward thousands of
men to whom pre-election promises
had been made. As the chairman of
the national committee he was bound
to see that the President received aid
in carrying out the policy to which he
was pledged. The President desired
Mr. Hanna In- his Cabinet, but that
was not to be thought of so long as
John Sherman lived, bo Mr. Sherman
was invited to become Secretary of
State, and Mr. Hanna was appointed
to the Sena'te.
At the next meeting of the Ohio Leg
islature It became necessary for Sena
tor Hanna to fight for the place. The
Legislature was very close, and the
Foraker and McKissen wing of the
party opposed Senator Hanna and tried
to defeat him, even though the place
should go to a Democrat. But Hanna
triumphed and his position was secure.
Not in the Senate, however. There
a man goes to the front only after he
has forced his way there. The Sen
ators of long service hang to their pre
rogatives, which they have obtained
only after years of planning, and a
new man finds little consideration if
he aspires to have a voice in leader
ship.
Hanna gradually worked his way to
the front, but he did not reach it until
after the second election of McKinley.
Even then he got a rebuff which would
have staggered an ordinary man. After
the election of 1900 he sent a letter to
all the Republican Senators, saying:
"Let us all be in our seats the first
day of Congress and pass the shipping
bill."
The Senators, almost to a man, re
sented this, and it was not until two
years later that Senator Hanna was
able to pass his bill In the Senate, and
then with the votes of the Iowa and
Wisconsin Senators against it, which
Insured its defeat in the House, be
cause of the influence of these two
States.
From the very minute that Mr. Roose
velt became President the relations be
tween him and Senator Hanna became
a matter for lively speculation. It was
believed that they would find it Impos
sible to get along harmoniously to
gether.
Mr. Hanna had been regarded as Me
legatee of Mr. McKinley, but the men
from the Western States, who had
forced the nomination of Mr. Roosevelt
at Philadelphia even after Mr. Rocso
velt, then Governor of New York, had
compelled the New York delegation O
drop him as its choice for second place,
did so in the full belief that Roosevelt
was entitled to the nomination in 1904.
Senator Hanna was the first great
preacher among the leaders of his party
against socialism. He put himself on
the platform. "Wealth and property
must meet labor half way if they would
prevent a social revolution."
Senator Hanna became interested in
the Council of Conciliation of the
American Civic Federation, which was
planned to prevent or settle labor dis
putes. He accepted the presidency of
that body. The day before he took the
place, sitting in his office in Washing
ton, he gave the Herald an Interview
in which he said:
"To succeed in this work I would
give up my seat in the Senate. I would
rather . be instrumental In bringing
about harmony Detween labor and cap
ital than be President of the United
States."
As president of the Council of Con
ciliation Mr. Hanna brought to the aid
of the cause men who had" scoffed at
such a thing, and they are now hearty
workers in the field of mediation. It
was Mr. Hanna who brought about the
settlement of the great strike of steel
workers in 1901. He endeavored to
bring to an adjustment the coal strike
of 19C2, and if the coal operators and
coal railroad presidents had followed
his advice the strike would have been
adjusted on terms much more favor
able than they finally got and would
have saved in business and wages the
enormous loss to the country of $39,
000,000.

I look baok over the first year's work
of our club, the details of which will
he given by the secretary in his report.
In genera i we have modified legisla
tion; vre have exorcised our influence
In favor of good roads; we have pretty
veil overcome the antagonism and
jrejudice of the community against
automobiles, and ihave succeeded In
placing our dub upon a sound and
permanent basis.
XEW ORDINANCE.
"I wish to take this opportunity to
explain the provisions of the new or
dinance regulating the use of auto
mobiles in this county.
"The ordinance provides that auto
mobiles always take the righthand !
side of the center of the road on meet
ing a vehicle; that the maximum
epeed shall not exceed twenty miles
an hour; that upon signal from an
approaching driver the autoist shall
k!o\v down to Fix miles an hour and
on second signal he shall bring his
machine to u full stop until the driver
ehall have passed. On mountain
sxades the automobile shall take the
outside of the grade. As a compensa
tion for this just ar.d liberal law we
have agreed to support the law and
prevent as far as we can its violation,
and we have also agreed to keep all
automobiles off the tunnel road.
"The chief work ahead of the club
for the coming year is to discourage
the reckless use of the auto and to
agitate constantly for good roads."
IIISTOI1Y IS REVIEWED.
Secretary YVeston in his annual re
port reviewed the history of the or
ganization of the club and then read
the following:
"The fear of the Merchants' Ex
change about the safety of a certain
road known as the tunnel road, in
which it had invested a large sum of
money for the benefit of Oakland,
w.us brought to the attention of the
club, and it decided to aid the mer
chants in restraining the automobilists
lrom using it, at least temporarily,
until it couid be improved. The exec
utive committee of the club met with
them and while expressly denying the|
right of any one to keep an auto off
a public road* agreed in the wisdom
and expediency of exercising a moral
restraint in this particular case and
has posted notices to that effect on the
tunnel road."
Mayor Olney was among the invited
guests at the banquet and delivered a
short address.

POSITION PLAIN
Oakland's Chief Executive Is
Added to Committee to Ap

THINK MOVE SIGNIFICANT
Politicians Believe Olney's Ac
ceptance "Will Aid Plan
Proposed by John L. Howard
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 15.
Mayor Warren Olney has been ask
ed and has consented to act in an ad
visory capacity with the committee of
three Councilmen chosen to select an
engineer to represent the city on the
board of three experts to appraise the
value of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany's plant. The Mayor's acceptance
is thought to be of much significance
by politicians. Heretofore it had been
reported that Mayor Olney did not ta.
vor the plan of solving the water ques
tion proposed by Councilman Howard.
His agreement to act with Councilmen
Dornin, Cuvellier and Pendleton, the
committee representing the City Coun
cil, apparently removes all doubt as to
where he stands. Councilman Howard
is also a member of the committee in
aii advisory capacity.
The exact purpose of the board of
experts, which is to be composed of
the city's expert, an expert of # the
Contra Costa Water Company an'd .a
third expert to be chosen by these
two, is to fix a basis of water rates for
the ensuing year, this basis also to be
used in the purchase or lease of the
water plant by the city, should such
a plan he decided upon.
Three More Items Deckled Upon.
BERKELEY. Feb. 15.â The citizens*
bond committee to-night decided to re
port three more items recommended by
5ub-committees and intendea for the
proposed bond issue to the Board of
Trustees. These items call for $35,000
for the Fire Department, $75,000 for a
new City Hall and $125,000 for the
schools. As it stands now the people
will be asked to vote upon items call
ing" for bonds amounting to $317,000,
segregated as follows: Wharf, $45,000;
streets. $7000; schools, $125,000; Fire
Department, $35,000; City Hall, $75,000;
parks, $10,000; manual training, $20,000.
When the bonding proposition is final
ly submitted the people will vote upon
these matters separately. The grand
total will be increased if the Town
Trustees decide to incorporate into the
bonding proposition an item calling fcr
$160,000 for a sewer system, making a
further total of $447,000. Guy Hyde
Chick of the street sub-committee told
the committee to-night that the present
sewer system is entirely inadequate.
When it rains the sewers in West
Berkeley overflow, endangering the
health of the district.

OAKLAND, Feb. 15.â These are the
items and amounts submitted to the
City Council to-night by the special
bond committee, which Is composed of
John L. Howard, chairman; B. H. Pen
dleton, A. H. Elliott, George W. Dornin
and B. C. Cuveiyer. The report goes
Into details as to each item. The rec
ommendations are as follows:
CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUNDS.
In recognition of the" general demand from
our citizens, and following the example of
other cities where the establishment of these
facilities for Juvenile recreation have been at
tended with satisfactory and beneficial re
sults, we believe â
First â That the reclaimed land owned by the
city and located In West Oakland should be
put into condition and equipped for the pur
pose at a cost of $30,000.
Secondâ That a suitable location should be
selected in the Sixth Ward, purchased and
fitted at a cost not to exceed $35,000.
Thirdâ That another , site should be pur
chased in the northwest corner of the Second
Ward, and similarly . fitted at. a cost not to
exceed $15. C00. '.
PARKS. V
We recommend â ' the 5 purchase of the De
Fremery property at Sixteenth and Adelino
streets, at a cost of $85,000. and for the Im
provement of the same, $10,000.
This will serve the needs of that portion ol
the city in that regard, and when properly
treated it will form one of the most beautiful
and attractive places of resort in our city.
We recommend the purchase of 300 acres
to be selected in and about what is commonly
known as the Sather Tract, in the nostheastem
part of the city, at a cost of $1000 per acreâ
*:i00,000. For the development and improve
ment of the same. $150,000.
We regard this as only the nucleus of a
central park, which will ultimately be ac
quired by the city. The combination of level
land for recreation and of hills for prospects
makes the site one of peculiar fitness and such
as is possessed by very few cities in the
country. . â¢
We recommend, if this property be pur
chRBed. that the services of an experienced
park engineer be secured to thoroughly study
the various features of the location, to the
end that when his plans shall be finally ap
provW their official adoption will serve to
fix a standard toward which expenditure may
be made. This course will avoid the some
times needless waste, of money In meeting the
views of changing administrations.
Wo recommend for the Improvement of In
dependence Park. $20,000.
And for Bushrod Park, $10,000.
Park site south of Twelfth-street dam. We
recommend an appropriation of $185,000.
The best method of treating this difficult
project has not yet been determined, and It
needs careful engineering stndy.
We recommend that f6r the acquisition and
improvement of property on the west side ot
Lake Merritt, between Twelfth and Lake
streets, and between Oak street and Lake
Shore, commonly known as "The Willows,"
there should be appropriated the sum of $150,
00O and for the Improvement of same the fur
ther sum of $50,000. ' "' "' *â¢-*-â¢
We believe UiHt when the citizens of Oak
land reach a full appreciation of the advantage
and the attractiveness of a salt water lake In
the center of the city, and whose supply may
be renewed with every incoming tide, they will
recognize the value and the necessity of ulti
mately controlling the entire shore front of
the lake, and this reoommendatlon Is Intended
to put the city into possession of a consider
able oortlon of It, when It may be had at a
cost that will not make Its consideration or
purchase prohibitive.
BOULEVARDS.
For the completion of the Lake Shore boule
vard on the east side of Lake M*errltt from
Its present terminus at East Eighteenth street
to station 11. thence across the head of the
lake to Pleasant Valley avenue, $115,000.
For the extension of the boulevard from
station 11 norteasterly to the southern en
trance of the proposed Central Park. $50,000..
This latter will constitute what is commonly
termed a "panhandle to the park," and it may
be so treated as to transfer the real entrance
to tho park from the southwesterly corner of
the Sather tract to the terminus of the Lake
Shore boulevard at station 11.
For the construction of a section of the
boulevard on the west side of Lake Merrltt,
between Twentieth and Twenty- fourth streets,
$65,000.
Proceedings are now under way for acquir
ing the property necessary for this Improve
ment, and the expense Is to be met by a pro
posed district assessment.
Inasmuch as the street improvement must
follow, the committee recommends that it be
treated as a section of the boulevard, which
It Is believed the city in the .future will ex
tend around the entire lake shore.
We believe that in the near future the city
will recognize the necessity of dredging this
lake bottom and of taking measurea to pre
vent the deposition of sewago and other waste
material within the lake area. We therefore
recommend that provision be made for this
future work to the extent of $50,000.
NEW CITY HALL.
The need for this improvement Is self-ap
parent and recognized by every citizen. The
modern practice In design and construction is
to meet the need of a city office building, at
the same time having due regard for such
architectural effects as are called for in a
structure for public purposes.
The present necessities of the city In these
respects may be met by a building to be
erected on the present City Hall property and
estimated to cost $375,000.
In view of the possibility (which by proper
treatment may be made a reality) of securing
a consolidation of Oakland. Berkeley and Ala-

I^^v- and Asthma.
I 2jÂ»e-Slmlta "' X^/'S s?' ,/ ' on erery
f BlCTMnreot box.
meda this design of the new City Hall is such
that it may be extended by additions along
Fourteenth and Fifteenth streets and also
along the rear bo as to make ample provision
to meet the business" necessities of the city in
all the years to come.
In addition to this we recommend the ac
quisition by the city, either by purchase or by
condemnation of the property between Four
teenth and Fifteenth streets and between Clay
street and San Pablo avenue that is not now
owned by the city at a cost of $250,000.
The reasons for this recommendation are:
1. The city will ultimately need the prop
erty and it cannot bÂ© purchased at a lower
cost than now
2. The revenue to be derived from the prea
ent improvements, until the city requires the
use of the land plus the taxes from the- in
creased value that will be given to surround
ing property will offset the interest on the
bonds u#ed by the city In its purchase.
3. When the union of the three cities is ac
complished, as It will be, no point In the
entire area could be found that will be more
central or better suited to the purposes than
the site of the present City Hall.
We recomend further that for the furnish
ing o f the new building there should be appro
priated the sum of $25,000.
BITUMINOUS CROSSWALKS.
To avoid the necessity of constantly renew
ing the plank walks throughout the city by
substituting those of a more desirable and
more permanent character we recommend the
sum of $100,000.
PUBLIC LIBRARY.
To meet the needs of the trustees for addi
additional equipment. $15,000.
WATER METERS.
In the anticipation of the acquisition by the
city of its own municipal water supply, and
In order to change from the present illogical
system of charging "flat rates" to that of
"actual consumption," we recommend that pro-
Vision be made for the early installation of
meters. It will have th"e positive effect of
curtailing, waste, and ' if found desirable this
amount of money may be subsequently re
turned to the city out of the revenues of the
water business â $140,000.
If for any reason the plant of the Contra
Costa Water Company Is neither leased nor
purchased, then the bonds contemplated in this
item will not be issued or sold. If, however,
the lease or purchase shall be made at a
price that commends itnelf to the citizens,
then this expenditure will at once be a ne
cessity. â . ...
STONE CULVERTS.
To replace perishable wooden bridges and
culverts in city streets that pass over deprÂ«s
slons carrying streams, we recommend the sub
stitutions of stone structures to cost $50,000.
CITY WHARF.
To replace the present untreated pile sub
structure by substituting a permanent founda
tion that will call for no expensive renewals â
515,000.
SEWERS.
T(T provide for the reconstruction, of the
western end of the main lake sewer, and to
make this artery efficient (which it is not now)
for the needs of the cityâ $70,000.
To prov/de a proper outlet for the east side
sewer and prevent its material from beins
carried into Lake Merrlttâ $20,000.
"To arrord" tJrainage â¢ for sewage ana storm
waters at Twenty-first avenue. East Oaklandâ
$10,000.
SCHOOL HOUSES AND SITES.
In view of the needs as represented by the
Board of Education, we have adopted and we
recommend the requisition made by that body
for public schools ($oe0,000) and for Polytechnic
School J150.000).
The report was referred to the com
mittee of the whole, to be taken up
at a meeting to be held Tuesday, Feb

WANTS SUIT PUSHED.
Aitkcn Demands Action In Water
Rate Case.
OAKLAND, Feb. 15.â Councilman
Altken to-night Introduced two resolu
tions directing that the City Attorney
push the water rate suit, which Is in a
position to be presented to the Supreme
Court, and asking that the Bay Cities
"Water Company submit a new offer to
the Council relative to a municipal
water supply.
Before these resolutions were offered
Altken read a lengthy speech, in which
he arraigned the plans of the special
water committee for the purchase of
the Contra Costa water plant as im
practical and in favor of the water
company. He advocated the appoint
ment of a board of three engineers as
a special committee to report on the
feasibility of the Bay Cities project and
made an attack upon John L. Howard,
the chairman of the special water com
mittee, which attack was resented and
replied to by Councilmen Pendleton,
Dornin and Cuvellier. *

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 15.
The four brothers of the 'late Mrs.
Gertrude Goewey Haven3 of Berkeley,
who, upon her deathbed, made a will
leavlns all her wealth to her newly
born son. will contest the testament of
their sister upon the ground that she
was not of sound mind when she made
It. To-day they filed a former will
made by her in 10 02, 'in which they
were left practically all of her estate,
which is valued at about $35,000.
Mrs. Havens was the wife of John
W. Havens of Berkeley, who is
wealthy in his own right. Shortly
after" her marriage she made the will
now presented by her brothers for
probate. It was witnessed by Judge
William P. Lawlor of San Francisco
and Elizabeth T. Brice of Oakville,
Napa County, and after a bequest of
$2000 to her husband she devised her
share in the Goewey Estate Company
of San Francisco to her brothers â
Charles H. f Frank B., James M. and
Herbert S. Goewey, share and share
alike.
Last March a son was born to Mrs.
Havens and a few days afterward she
died. Just before her death ' she re
quested that another will be drifwn
up, leaving everything she possessed
to her son and heir. She was too weak
to siffn her name and s'mply made
her mark, which was witnessed by
Ethel Sherman, 930 Filbert street, and
Elizabeth M. Cole, 2033 Charming
way, Berkeley. This last will disin
herits every one but the child, whose
uncles will contest its right to inherit
what they deem should be theirs.

BEGINS TO FIX
RATES FOR GAS

TESTIFY AS TO QUALITY
*
General Manager Lawless to
File Inventory and Value of
Property of the Corporation
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
met as a committee of the whole, with
Supervisor Sanderson in the chair, to
begin Its Investigation into the financial
operations of companies supplying gas
and electricity for the purpose of fixing
thÂ« rates to be charged therefor during
the next fiscal year.
General Manager Lawless of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company
was the first witness on the stand and
gave testimony as to the cost of gas in
the holder, which he said was 31.59
cents per 1000 cubic feet. The cost of
gas in the burner Is 40.73 cents, or a
total cost of 72.32 cents. Of this total,
Lawless said, 10.47 cents was for distri
bution, 2.22 cents for office expenses and
2S.04 cents for miscellaneous expenses.
Continuing Lawless said:
"We manufacture nothing but water gas. but
we bought a quantity of coal gas at 30 centa
per 10OO cubic feet, which we turned into our
mains to mix with the water gas. There is
about 14 per cent more carbon monoxide, in
water gas than in coal gas. The high cost
of manufacturing coal gas would necessitate
a charge of $1 11 per 1000 feet. We have not
made any coal gas for some time, but the plant
is kept in reserve until such time as coal will
be cheap enough to warrant a rate below that
fixed by the municipality. We would have to
purchase South Prairie or Nanaimo coal at
$3 50 a ton. It is now as high as $5 a ton.
In 1003 we used 216.4S2 barrels of ga3 oil at
74.57 cents a barrel. In 1902 we used 142.341
barrels, which cost us $1 09 a barrel. The
cost of coke is advancing and the contractors
win be unable to furnish us oil at the con
tract price
The number of complaints as to the poor
quality of gas has fallen off CO per cent. We,
being under tlrÂ». have dono everything possible
to give the people good service. The result
of the complaints was that we increased thÂ«
pressure, but the bills were correspondingly
Increased.
Superintendent of Gas Manufacture
H. Pabst gave evidence as to the com
ponent elements of water gas, which he
said costs less to manufacture than
coal gas.
Lawless agreed to file an inventory of
all the properties of the corporation and
the value thereof. Lawless said the
mains of the lighting concerns ab
sorbed by the San Francisco Company
were all being used In the Interest of
efficient service. Captain A. H. Payson,
vice president of the company, ex
plained that the mains of the absorbed
companies were in different districts.
The board adjourned to meet on next
Tuesday at 3:30 p. m.
Schooner Alcalde Wrecked.
The schooner Alcalde, while lying at Gray*

It was expected that the entries for
the events would be ready yesterday,

that part of the programme, was un
able to have them classified in time.
He stated, however, that the list was
the largest that has yet been entered,
and that in point of quality the ponies
were the best to be had.

A committee comr>osed of L. Mc-

was named to handicap the events. An
effort will be made to secure the ser
vices of General Barrett as judge for
the racing-, though it is not known
whether he will consent.
Two carloads of ponies were shipped
from this city to Del Monte yesterday
afternoon, and two more carloads prob
ably will be shipped to-day, as well as
three from Riverside and Santa Babara
that are expected to arrive In this city
this morning.
The executive committee is making
strenuous efforts to secure Tanforan
racetrack for the pony racing events.
The California Jockey Club people will
be approached to-day regarding the
deal, and it is thought likely that the
latter will consent to the proposition.
Carolan's private track, while one of
the best laid out and neatest In the
country, is not quite large enough for
the coming event, and for that reason
Tanforan is wanted. The Ninth Cavalry
and the Fifteenth Infantry from Ord
Barracks will give several exhibitions
of rough ridins during the carnival.
HUNT ORDERS DISMISSAL
OF THE GLADSTONE SUIT
Finds Millionaire Is Entitled to judg
ment Because of Lack of Prose
cution by Plaintiff;
A dismissal of the suit of Elizabeth
Gladstone against Joseph â¢ Boardman.
the aged millionaire, was ordered yes
terday by Judge Hunt. This decision,
following close upon the heels of a
motion to dismiss the suit, effectually
disposes of Mrs. Gladstone's claim
against the millionaire. -
Mrs. Gladstone sued Boardman for
$500,000 damages for alleged breach
of promise. The suit was tried before
a Jury in Judge Hunt's court and a
verdict for 525,000 was given the
j plaintiff, Boardman appealed from
the judgment and a new trial was
granted him on the ground that the
evidence did not justify the verdict.
The new trial wasgranted two years
ago and since then Mrs. Gladstone has
made no effort to have her second
trial brought to an issue. Because of
her neglect Boardman came into court
ivnth a motion to dismiss the action.
His motion was heard two weeks airo
and Judge Hunt yesterday decided
that he was entitled to a favorable
f?iT? nt , because Mrs. Gladstone
foiled to give sufficient reasons for her
delay.

COURT ORDERS
FAVOR MACHEN
Justice Pritchard Disposes of
Prayers of Prosecution in
the Postal Frauds Cases
DEFENDANTS ARE FAVORED
"Not Guilty" to Be Verdict if
Facts Can Be Accounted For
on Fair Theory of Innocence
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â When the
postoffice conspiracy trial was re
sumed to-day the prosecution offered
two additional prayers, one referring
to the statements made by some of the
defendants to postoffice inspectors and
the other denning a reasonable doubt.
Justice Pritchard disposed of them
by announcing that he would charge
the jury that these statements should
not have any effect on the defendants,
except on the one making them, and
the jury should not conjure imaginary
doubts to avoid performance of a dis
agreeable duty. The verdict must be
"not guilty" fop all of the defendants,
if the facts and circumstances and
their act's can be accounted for on any
reasonable theory consistent with the
presumption of innocence, or if the al
leged conspiracy is not established as
having been entered into with intent to
defraud the United States. Most of the
prayers of the defense were granted by
the court.
What is deemed by them an impor
tant one Instructs the jury that if they
believe from the evidence that Lorenz
owed Machen $25,000 or any other sum,
Lorenz had a perfect right to pay
Machen that sum wholly or partly in
such manner and methods as he chose.
He had the right to pay it partly by
checks and partly by drafts at his own
convenience or to equalize the balances
in the banks with which he had ac
counts to make payments in such pro
portionate parts as he chose of the
amounts received from the Groffs from
time to time. Machen, the court will
add, had the right to receive and accept
payments on account of the indebted
ness, even though he knew they were
derived wholly or partly from Lorenz's
interest in the profits of the Groff fas
tener sales: provided that Machen's
official action as to the fasteners was
not thereby affected; also provided
that the jury finds the transaction be
tween the Groffs and Lorenz was bona
fide, contemplating in this connection
the manner of the payments.
The instructions granted direct that
no act or statement of ths defendants
after the alleged conspiracy was con
summated can be considered as evi
dence tending to show the existence of
the alleged conspiracy. The statements
of certain of the defendants on May 27
last are not to be considered as evi
dence of the existence of the alleged
conspiracy, but merely as tending to
show that any one making such state
ment was a party to conspiracy which
may have been established already to
tho satisfaction of the jury beyond a
reasonable doubt. In determining tne
question whether the $25,000 note al
leged to have been given by Lorenz to
Machen was in fact executed at the
time stated and as to the good faith
the jury may consider the extent and
value of the oil lands acquired by the
Pluto Oil Company subsequently
turned over to the Crystal Refining
Company, the cost of refining, etc., and
other circumstances showing value of
the property.
The submission of prayers was con
cluded at the afternoon session. The
arguments will begin to-morrow and
the case probably will go to the jury
Friday.

MIMO IS BEATEN BY MURESCA
IN A VERY EXCITING FINISH
Four Public Choices
Take Purses at
Ingleside.
Between a thirty-knot gale that
swept over the course and rain tb/it
fell in sheets there were many dis
advantages about the racing at Ingle
side yesterday. Still, under these un
propitious climatic conditions form was
maintained, four out of six public
choices splashing home first The at
tendance was only fair.
While. Jean Gravler was apparently
best of the bunch starting in the open
ing Futurity course sprint Polonlus,
the 9 to 5 favorite, was returned the
winner. J. F. Sheehan rode Jean Gra
vier and after getting into all sorts of
pockets and being repeatedly cut off
the black horse only lost by a head.
Dr. Sherman, a 40 to 1 shot, which led
into the stretch, was a good third.
Thaddeus, from his poor showing, is
not a mudlark.
Both Edith Vice and Marie J ran ex
tremely bad races, and there is little
wonder that Eduardo won the half
mile scramble for two-year-olds. Why
they performed so indifferently is un
explainable. for as a rule two-year-olds
are very consistent. At any rate Sac
charate, the Napa Stock Farm entry,
was the only one able to raise a gallop
and had the favorite straight to win
by less than a length. Mogregor fin
ished third.
As Roach, while a promising lad, Is
not a fashionable rider, 2 to 1 %-as laid
about Lansdowne in the betting on the
next, a Futurity course run. Hand
press came in for strong backing be
cause of Hildebrand having the mount,
and did play a limited engagement out
i:i front. Then Lansdowne assumed
the leading position and in a drive led
Whiskers out at the end less than a
length. was a remote fourth, be
hind Handpress.
The critics were Inclined to blame
Hildebrand for losing the fourth event
with the favorite, Mimo. He had the
lead at the paddock, but drew his whip
and Knapp, astride Muresca, got the
decision by a scant head. Flaneur, a
10 to 1 shot, finished a fair third.. Hilde
brand carried Muresca wide turning
into the stretch and it is probable that
the best horse won.
It was a Job lot batch that lined up
in the seven-furlong selling number.
Past Master on form looked about the
best, but was unable to get any part of
the purse, after showing prominently
to the stretch. Candidate, a 16 to 1
shot from Dr. Rowell's stable, made all
the running:, only to be collared and
beaten out by Bonner on The Ledaean.
Outburst, at 50 to 1, ran a close third.
First Chip appeared to be every-,
body's pick to take the closing mile
run. .There was a little market for
Constellator, but the bis money went
in on First Chip, forcing the odds from
3 down to 9 to 5 favoritism. There
never was any doubt about the result,
the first choice winning all the way.
Constellator ran a tame second, three
lengths away, and Pierce J finished
third __.
XOTKS OF THE TRACK.
The poor showing of Faulconbrldge
in the stake event last Saturday Is eas
ily accounted for now. The horse bow
ed a tendon.
Almost on the eve of the California
Derby Garnet Ferguson experiences a
piece of verv bad luck. While out gal
loping on the track at Ingleside on
Sunday, his great colt Bearcatcher
shied at a piece of paper and later
pulled up very lame. It transpires
that the brown colt strained a tendon
and will have to be shelved for some
time.
Harry Stover lost Pierce J after the
last race. The chestnut 'horse was
claimed for $823 by E. Tierney, owner
of Mr. Dingle.
Parker & Thwaites shipped their
string of three. Fossil, Planet and Bo
logna, to Little Rock last night, along
in the same car with the Henshall sta
ble. "Big Bill" Knapp, the stable
rider, will remain here until the end of
the week.
Roach rode two wlners yesterday
and has a chance now to make a good
rider.
This will be Hildebrand's last day
here in the saddle. .

VICTIM OF BLAST MAY
YET RECOVER DA3IAGES
United States Circuit Cotirt of Appeals
Reverses Judgment and Orders Re
trial of Henry Smith's Suit.
The United States Circuit Court of
Appeals in the case of Henry Smith
vs. J. G. Day reversed the judgment of
the lower court, which -was 'in favor
of the defendant, and remanded the
case for a new trial.
The action was brouzht to recover
damages for personal injuries. The
defendants were contractors for the
construction of locks for the Govern
ment at the Cascades. The complain
ant alleged that while asleep In the
cabin of a steamboat he was struck
on the head and injured by a frag
ment of rock from a blast operated
by the defendants about 200 feet
Judge Gilbert in his dissenting opin
ion takes the ground that the com
plainant had knowledge ">f the fact
that blasting was going on before he
went upon the boat, for he heard the
noise of the explosions. The sound of
the blasting itself, continues , Judge
Gilbert, was the best form of notice
that could be riven.
In the matter of the condemnation
by the United States Government of
the schooner Kuwalani at Hawaii, the
judgment of the lower court was af
firmed. The vessel had been seized
and condemned for illegally removing
spirituous liauors on which the reve
nue tax had not been paid.

Work With- Gift Â»of $5000
ACCEPT RECTOR'S ADVICE
Both Women Will Add to Sums
Contributed for Aid of Poor
in the Tenement Districts
NEW YORK, Feb. 15.â Mrs. W. K.
Vanderbilt and her sister-in-law, Mrs.
J. Borden Harriman,* have determined
to" accept* literally and act upon the
advice recently given by the Rev. Dr.
Rainsford of St. George's Church, who
deplored the exclusive attitude of wom
en of wealth, saying that they should
take a more direct and active interest
in the affairs of those less fortunate.
Mrs. Vanderbilt has begun her work
by giving $5000 to -4he Presbyterian
Hospital training school for nurses,
with the condition that it be Bpent to
pond nurses into the tenement houses.
This sum, it is understood, will be only
a fraction of what she will devote to
the Fame purpose, if the work prospers
as she hopes.
Mrs. HarYiman has joined in the
movement, and both have determined
not only to supply funds but to give
liberally of their time. For the better
management of the undertaking a gov
'erning committee will be formed, of
which both women will be members.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1904.
AMERICAN SHIP W. F. BABCOCK
IS QUOTED FOR REINSURANCE
Vessel Is on Her Way Here From Baltimore â Was Reported
Ashore in Chesapeake Bay at Outset of Voyage, and Although
Pilot Denied Truth of the Rumor Underwriters Feel Anxious
Shortly after the American ship W.
F. Babccck left Baltimore last Septem
ber she was reported ashore in Chesa
peake Bay. Word was received later
ol her having been floated unharmed
and in condition to continue her barely
commenced voyage. Still later the pilot
that took the ship to sea was heard
from and he denied absolutely that the
vessel had been ashore or in any dan
ger. She had anchored on account of
the fog, he said, and the report of her
having been ashore vaa carried by
some one who sighted her after the
fog had lifted, but before she had got
up her anchor. The Babcock left Balti
more 129 days ago and yesterday was
quoted for reinsurance at 15 per cent.
The Babcock is one of the Sewall fleet
and is commanded by Captain Moxsen,
who was promoted to his present
charge for his gallant efforts in fight
ing fire on the ship Shenandoah, of,
which he was chief officer.
The American ship Bangalore is also
overdue, considerably more so than the
Babcock. She is out 177 days from
Baltimore for Port Los Angeles and Is
quoted at 15 per cent. The French
bark General Mellinet is out 137 days
from Xew Caledonia and 10 per cent
reinsurance is being paid on her.
The other overdues are quoted as fol
lo-.vs: Thcodor. 30 per cent; Martaban,
90 per cent, and Robert Rickmers, 15
per cent.
Spending S20.000.000 on Wharves.
The China Commercial Company's steamship
Clavering left Falina Cruz yesterday for this
port. Salh'a Cruz Is the new port of call in
Mexico for the vessels of this line and prom
ises to be one of the most important ports
on the Pacific Coast? With transcontinental
railroad communication almost coin-ilsted and
$20,000,000 worth of docks and wharves under
construction tbe Mexican port Is beginning to
be considered as a shipping point of no little
interest to the commercial world. Captain
Frederick Miller, who railed in at Kalina Cruz
when on Ms way to Acajutla with the little
tug Izalco, says that the port is being
equipped on a gigantic and strictly up-to-date
plan and that an enormous transcontinental
and trans-Pacific trade will undoubtedly flow
through there in the near future.. Most of
the harbor improvement work is being done by
a British contractor, who has under way work
for which he will receive more than 520,000,
000.
Completes Round Trip.
The steamer Charles Xelson arrived yester
day from San Pedro, completing; the first round
trip she has made since the collier Kdlth
brought her Into port a dismantled derelict.
She has been repaired and is strung and sea
worthy as ever. Captain Gunderson, whose
good judgment prevented the loss of a single
life when the coaster was abandoned, is still
in command. The Xelson left here January
28 for Astoria. She called here on the way
south to lar.d passengers and is back again,
ready for another trip.
Off Port for Ten Days.
The British ehlp Madagascar, which arrived
Sunday from Antwerp, was off this port for
ten days, battling with southerly gales. She
was 150 days on the passage and Captain
Macfarlane says that the worst weather of
the voyage was encountered off this coast dur
ing the last ten days of the long Journey.
Denderah in Collision.
The Kcsmos liner Denderah. bound, from
Hamburg for this port, has put back to Lon
don with her bow plates smashed and dented,
as the result of a. collision.

BEQUEST FUND
TO BE PROBED
Supervisors' Finance Committee
to Inquire Into Distribution
of Cash Left bv II. E.Robinson
PASSES FORAGE DEMANDS
Declares Poor Street Sweeping
Is Dne to the Lack of Of
ficial Supervision of the Work
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
decided yesterday to Institute an In
vestigation Into the manner of the dis
tribution of the Robinson bequest fund.
The committee cited the officers of sev
eral societies who have been beneficiar
ies under the fund to appear at its
next meeting: and give testimony as
to how the money received from the
fund had been utilized.
Supervisor Payot stated that the
terms of the bequest required that the
fund shall be used only for the relief
of women and children and he was
satisfied that the specific provisions of
the bÂ«quest had not been complied with.
The committee approved demands
aggregating 5743 In favor of E. Algel
tlnger & Co. for forage furnished to
County Jail No. 2. The bills are those
that ex-Sheriff Lackmann had refused
to sign because the cost of forage used
during the six months ending Decem
ber 31, 1903, was $500 in excess of a
similar period in 1902. Lackmann said
he had instructed Superintendent Mar
tin not to order any more forage and
in the face of that instruction the ad
ditional bills were submitted. Martin
said he wa$ compelled to order more
forage because he had taken care of
horses belonginp to other city depart
ments. The committee saw no alter
native but to sign the bills, as the for
age was furnished to and used by the
city. The bills were ordered paid by
formal resolution of the Board of Su
pervisors.
The committee designated the room
now used by the Public Library as a
newspaper reading room as quarters
for boys awaiting trial before the Juve
nile Court. Other rooms In the base
ment of the City Hall Were allotted to
the Public Library for its uses.
POOR STKKET SWEEPING.
The Finance Committee also investi
gated the complaints that the streets
are being poorly swept, on which ac
count the bills of J. G. Harney and
Felix McHugh for January were held
up at the last meeting. L. M. King
of the Merchants' Association thought
the contractors were not using due dili
gence In cleaning the streets and that
they were employing men who are
physically incapable of doing the work.
Commissioners of Works Casey and
Woodward said the complaints regard
ing street sweeping were too general
in character. They urged that the
blocks on which poor work was done
be designated more particularly. Good
inspectors are supervising the work and
the contractors are being continually
fined for laxity, much to their dissat
isfaction.
Supervisor d'Ancona said he had no
ticed that seme streets were not prop
erly sprinkled, resulting In clouds of
dust rising when they are swept. In
ordering the bills paid the committee
expressed the opinion that there was
lack of proper official supervision of
the work.
DEFICIENCIES IX FUNDS. .
Expert Williams filed a statement
with the Finance Committee that there
will probably be deficiencies in the fol
lowing accounts on June 30, 1904:
Tax Collector's extra clerks." (10,793 70; as
sessment roll extension. $7409 05; burial of
Indigent dead. $1S9O: examining insane. $750;
reporters in criminal cases. $:{370; mainten
ance non-sectarian institutions. J62O; total.
$24,022 7.V
In the matter of commissions paid by
the State on collateral inheritance taxes
there is now $18,218 87 to the credit
thereof.
There is now available in the urgent
necessity fund the sum of $3456 83.
Get Damnses for Father's Death.
A jury in Judge Graham's court
yesterday gave to Emma E. Salmon
and Lurline Farmer judgment for
$4 300 damages against P. F. Rathjen,
a pork packer. The suit was for $10,
000 damages for the death of John
Farmer, father of the plaintiffs, who
was killed by being run over by a team
owned by Rathjen.

NEW TORK. Ftb. 13.â The stock market
to-Â«i*y marked time tnd at Intervals came to
a halt, but, tlight as was the demand for
â¢â tockB.' it was eurflrlent to maintain prices,
as the offerings were entirely insiginflcant.
There was no eign of liquidation, nor did the
professional traders \-cr.ture to take the short
Â«ic> of the market. In spite of the stagnant
condition of the trading, a condition that
usually invites seme aggression by profes
sional bears. There was nothing In the day's
news that seemed to have any influence upon
tlie market, beyond the negative influence of
the relief felt at the absent of selling pres
sure. The tpeelal demand from Baltimore last .
week for funds which counteracted the cur
rency movement to New York is expected to
continue this week, une estimates of the
probable shipments to bÂ« made this week run
nine to improbable figures. The financial
world, horn-ever, is In a very corr.i>osed frame
of mind regarding the money outlook. In spite
of the Baltimore demand, the coming Panama
can&l payment and the continued temporary
borrowing by railroads, which receives a
" greater or less addition every day. The ab
stract of the reports of national banks through
out the country, as of January 22. shows some
comparisons Â«ith the condition of November
17 the period cf the last caJ! by the Con
troller which helps to explain this confl
uence While the totsl of loans for that period
has increased *o.T.e S.44.O0O.OOO. the reports of
j; cw York Clearinjr-bouse banks between the
nearest coreEpondini; dates thow . an increase
of f7S 000.000. The aErregate Increase of de
posit* which reached S124.OO0.O00. is also ex
reedei by the New York increase, which was
$130 OOO.C'00. It thus appears that the enor
mous increase tvl-.Jrh was noted in the New
Y<rk back leans during that time, and which
has pone rtili further tlnre them, wai accom
par.ied by an actcnl nhrtnka.ire in the loan ac
ecurit ct cthfr R&tlona! barks.
Of te-<5av's few noteworthy movement*, that
in AmalromcteHJ Copper was attributed to an
urt'-snre In the price of copper. The closing
â m firm, but nearly stagnant. The day's

Futurc Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. FÂ£b. 15.â A new ' high record
price was reached to-day in wheat for May
deliveryâ OS cents a bushel. With the war
advancing foreign grain markets, the visible
Ktipply diminishing and with crop prospects
in the Southwest threatened by the cold
weather, short selling of the May option was
practically abandoned, July absorbing mot>t
of the new business. Closing pricesiwere near
the top, with May %c above Saturday's final
figures.
The wheat market was bullish from start
to finish. Higher prices at Liverpool and Ant
werp, together with cold weather in thÂ« South
weft, where the ground lacks sufficient snow
covering, caused an opening advance in May
of %c to %c. initial sales being made at
Sti'^c to l)ti*ic. Julf was up % r iihio to
\Â±<fl%c at SÂ»c x.o.tO'X.Q. There .was' an .unu
sually Bond demand lor the July and Septem
ber deliveries, but owning to the congested
condition of May much difficulty â¢ was expe
rienced in executing orders in that option on
either side. Offerings wi-re remarkably light, !
and on that account little difficulty was en
countered in forcing prices upward. Commls- !
sion houses were active bidders for July, and '
f-horts covered both May and July. Before
the end of the flrÂ«t half-hour May had ad- i
vanced to 9~V,c and July to KÂ»%e. The lead- |
Ing long had wheat for sale on the advance, :
as also did the Fmall holders. Under this
profit-taking celling- the market had a slight
setback. May declining to l)04c and July to
K) l ic The demand, however, was of the best
possible character on the reaction. A report
that the visible supply was greatly increased '
helped to create added strength, and the dl.<
position to buy on the domestic situation was i
more pronounced. The strength of cash wheat
In all markets was again a dominating infln
ence in the speculative trading. The market
was extremely bullish during the last hour.
Under active covering by shorts the price of
May touched a new high record mark at OSc,
while the July option sold up to 9u%o. The
market reacted ellghlly on the profit-taking,
but the dose was strong, with May at IÂ»7v4c
and July at 904c Clearances of wheaf>and
flour were equal to 284,000 bushels. Primary
receipts were 949,000 bUEhels, compared with
704,400 bushels a year ago. The amount on
passage increased 2,112.000 bushels, while the
visible supply decreased 82.0O0 bushels. July
closed 1%Â®1%c up. May corn was l%giv :( c
higher; oats unchanged, and provisions 10c
to 274c hicher.
Corn phowed independent strength on an
active ceneral trade. Like wheat, it was
helped by the foreign situation. May opened
Vic to 4c higher at 55c to SS^ic, sold up to
50%c, but reacted on profit-taking, the close
being at 5C4@50Ue:. July showed a final
gain of 4Â©%c, closing at 53%i@53%c. Local
receipts were B08 cars, two of contract grade.
Oats felt the effects of the war and the in
dication of an increased trade, sharing the
bullish proclivities of wheat and corn during
the greater fart cf the session. Final figures
In May were* precisely where they left off
Saturday. The opening v.-as 4c to %c higher
at 44'4c to 444c and after selling up to
45c, closed at ii%r. July closed ',<,c higher
at :59?ie. Local receipts were 400 cars.
The provision market was comparatively as
active and strong as the grain markets.' In
the face of liberal receipts of hogs a,nd lower
prices at the yards an urgent investment de
mand was manifested during the entire day
which resulted in marked gains. Packers and
local longs were the principal sellers. The
close was strong, with prices near the top
May pork was up 274c at $15. after ranging
between $14 80 and $15 03; May lard closed
10c higher at $7 75, while ribs were 10111240

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Receipts of Potatoes were 11.519 sacks In
cluding 8097 from Oregon. The demand among
retailers and Jobbers was still rather light and
th* top price of Oregon stock, ex-steamer, was
shaded, liivers moved slowly, but the few
dealers who controlled the market were flrm
In their views arid prices were maintained.
Sweets were In fair request and choice lots
were easily disposed of at a slight advance.
Two cars were on sale. Onions ruled firm at
uncharged rates. Receipts were lam sacks,
nearly all of which -came from Oregon.
Prices of Peas and Tomatoes from Los An
geles ranged lower under heavy receipts and a
liberal carry-over from Saturday. Nearly 200
packages of each came In. : Receipts,, of other
vegetables from the same region continued light
and prices of choice lots were well sustained.
There were some very poor String and Wax
Beans offering below the minimum quotations,
but they were . hard to sell. Mushrooms were
suddenly plentiful and ruled weak at sharply
reduced prices. 1 Sales by the box were fre
quent and there was quite a quantity unsold
at the close. Small lots of Asparagus came In
from the river and sold at 50c per pound. .

Poultry and Game.
As usual on Monday there was very little do
mestic Poultry received and prices of all de
' scriptions were unchanged and largely nominal.
A car of Western was on 3ale and moved oft
rather slowly, as the Chinese dealers, who arc
generally the principal buyers on Monday, were
not in the market. Only one case of dressed
Turkeys came in.
Wild Ducks formed a large percentage of the
receipts' of Game and all descriptions were
Quoted lQwer, as yesterday was the last day of
the open sea.Â«on and dealers were anxious to
clean up. The quotations were obtained only
for the best offerings, no reasonable offer being
] refused for poor and thin birds. Geese, Snipe
and Rabbits were fairly steady at previous
prices.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter opened the week dull and depressed,*
with large stocks on hand and & slow demand.
Some dealers were offering the pick of their
floors at 25o. There were sales, indeed, a,
couple Â«f cents over this figure, but such sales 1
represented small lots of special marks taken
by customers who must have those particular |
brands for their trade, practically regardless ,
of price. There are always some consumers j
who usÂ« one particular brand of Butter, nnd
these always pay over the general market. But
the great bulk of buyers could get what they
wanted yesterday at 25(if2Ce.
There was nothing new in Cheese. The mar
ket continued dull.
Eggs, like Batter, were dull, with accumu
lating stocks nnd large receipts. There were ,
large shipments north on yesterday's steamer 1
and it was reported that the (.emand for that '
quurter still continues. This> is fortunate, for !
otherwise prices would probably be much lower .
than they are. :

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Prices of all descriptions stand as pre
viously quoted. The rain checked trade In
Citrus fruUs. both in the open market and In '
the auction rooms, where the offerings were
large. The demand for Oranges was confined ;
chiefly to the large sizes, of Navels, small and j
medium elzed fruit being neglected. At the !
auction sale nine cars of Navels were sold, asj
follows: Extra fancy, $1 2002; ordinary '
fancy. $1Â©1 50; choice. COciftJl 25; standard. I

Chicago was higher on the day, with offer

paid that receipts of Hogs were again large,
although locally a little less than had been ex
pected. Exports of provisions for the week are
little less than last year. The war and the
strength In grains are still Â»ncouraglng the
strcng bullish sentiment and this continues to
add to Its holdings and to advance the price. |

Kennedy Gets New Trial.
The Supreme Court yesterday af
firmed the '.lower court's order grant
ing a new trial to William B. Ken
nedy, who was convicted of complicity
in the murder of Policeman Robin
son on Valencia street about two year*
ago. The only direct evidence against
the defendant was the testimony of
an accomplice. The court says It la
doubtful if a new trial should not
have been granted by reason of the
insufficiency of the evidenct.

ONE HALF BEADY IX CASH
Members of the Concern Stand
Ready to Personally Make Up
Any Deficiency Thai Occurs
The creditors of Bolton, de Ruyter
& Co. win receive 100 cents on the dol
lar of their claims against the firm if
the committee of creditors that was
appointed to Investigate and report is
rot mistaken. This announcement was
made at a meeting ot the creditors yes
terday afternoon and it was well re
ceived. J. H. Jellett. the chairman of
the creditors' committee, read the re
port, which was sigrned by himself and
S. Goldzieher and TO. B. Fisher, his
associates on the committee.
Before the meeting was adjourned it
was voted by the creditors in attend
ance that they would accept the report
and also the terms of the firm, which
were that 50 per tent of. the total in
debtedness should be paid in cash at
the counter immediately: that 25 per
cent should be paid in thirty days, and
the remaining: 25 per cent in six months
or earlier, to carry no interest.
"Our firm conviction is," so reported
the creditors' committee, "that the
creditors will receive 100 cents on the
dollar if the matter is settled out of
court, and we therefore strongly rec
ommend the settlement." tfhere was
little question among the creditors
present, who numbered a score or more.
They accepted the immediate payment
of 50 per cent as an evidence of good
faith and of assurance that the re
maining 50 per cent would be paid as
predicted by the committee.
WILL AVOID COURTS.
While the members of the firm, who
were present at the meeting of the
creditors, made no remarks, Thomas
C. Van Sasa, their' attorney, spoke
briefly and took the same view con
cerning-the final settlement as did the
creditors' committee. After a few
questions had been asked the report
was adopted and the creditors voted
to go on as the committee had recom
mended and not carry the matter into
the courts for settlement.
The creditors' cc-mmittee, Roing Into
details, reported that the assets
amounted to $109,351 53. which cere in
the following items: Cash, $30,358 59;
outstanding: accounts and bills receiv
able, $73,91)2 99; office fixtures, $500;
membership in Chicago Board of Trade,
$3j00; two memberships in Merchj>->tjÂ» f
Exchange, $1000. The liabilities
amounted to $83,273 37, so that there
was an apparent surplus of $26,073 21.
The committee reported that the firm
had no desire to compromise with its
creditors, but would pay the entire in
debtedness in three payments, one of
50 per cent and two of 25 per cent each,
and, to assure the carrying out of the
agreement, would realize on the as
sets and the individual members of the
firm would without delay take steps
to convert their individual holdings into
cash in order to meet any deficiency
th2t might arise.
â¢ BIG PROMISSORY NOTE.
In the outstanding accounts, so the
creditors' committee also reported,
there was a promissory note falling
due in eleven months, upon which there
was a balance owing of $30,713 75. Â».he
same being secured by a second mort
gage on a ranch in Colusa County, con
sisting of about C600 acres and assessed
for $63,100, including improvements; but
this was not immediately available or
convertible into cash.
The first mortgage was for about
$27,500. A portion of the unsecured out
standings would be slow of collection
and some would possibly prove of
no value. The creditors, in the opinion
of the committee, need have no uneasi
ness, for the reason that the individual
members of the firm had interests in
real and personal property aside from
the partnership assets, which should
make up any firm deficiency, should a
deficiency exist.

JUDGE DUNNE'S COURT WHILE THE JURY THAT IS TO TRY. HIM. FOR THE MURDER OF HIS

The task of impaneling a jury to

When Walter N. Brunt, one of the
talesmen, was being examined, he was
asked if he had expressed any opinion
on the case and he frankly replied that
he had read in the papers about the
murder and was satisfied in his own
mind that the defendant should be
hanged. He was led to suppose that
a plea of temporary insanity would be
trumped up.
Attorney Alford for the defendant
objected to Brunt making a harangue
and the Judge said he did not want
to hear any speeches from any one,
either inside or outside the jury box.
Brunt was challenged by the defense
for cause and the challenge was al
