PROMJNENT OFFICERS OF THE

FAR EAST.
The Embassadors again' returned to
the charge. In, a. conciliatory spirit
they, demanded, not 260, but sixty for
eign officers, and, not to be outdone in
the matter* of ' concessions, '. the Sultan
agreed to employ twenty- five. In ac
cepting "this compromise' the Embas
sadors, in a note whlclr they sent in on
March 30, stated that the twenty-five
officers would proceed to Macedonia,
and wheri'it. became, .apparent" that
more* were required they would again
approach his Imperial Majesty on the
subject. i^Si*l- , .
This attitude on the part of Em
bassadors elicited from the palace the
most prompt and spirited ' note that
has come through the Sublime Porte
in many a long day. It stated with
quite ' Western : frankness and without
any Oriental verbiage whatsoever that
the number of twenty-five' represents
the limit of endurance in the matter
of . the .enrollment of foreign officers to
serve a country of whose languages
and customs and topography the offi
cers in ouestion can but be and are
absolutely ignorant. As a result, there
Is much rushing around and number
less strange rumors in : circulation . to
explain the new- and decidedly stiffer
attitude of the Porte.
I do not reproduce them, â¢ because I
think the explanation is not far to
seek. Macedonia is pacified. -but it is
not yetjnah ideal^state-^far from it.
There are at large a~few bands of Bul
garian .cbmmltteemen and a ; few < Al
banians and about half the usual
quota of local bandits.

CONSTANTINOPLE. April 12â The
gendarmerie detailed for the Macedo
nian reforms has entered upon a new
phase. . At last 6ne side of the contro
versy has taken a firm stand, and this
side is not that of the powers, more or
less united, but the Sublime Porte. It
will be remembered that at the begin
ning a demand was made for 260 com
missioned and non-commissioned for
eign officers to serve in the Macedonian
police, more or less under Hilma Pasha.
The Sultan acceded in principle to this
demand â unwisely, as many of his ad
visers thinkâ but. curtailed the number
of foreign officers . considerably. The
Porte announced that Hilma Pasha
could find employment for five officers,
one from each of the interested pow
ers. *

Some of the prelates of Vatican

much .affected of late by reported an
archistic plots against his life. As. he
allows no one to open his private cor

weeks several anonymous letters

SHARP NOTE
FROM PORTE
TO POWERS
King. Edward and Lord Lansdowne
feel that their work is almost ac
complished and that there is no chance
that Russia can appeal successfully to
any great nation to help her in evad
ing arrangements which circumscribe
her ambitions. Hence "the King and
the Foreign Secretary believe that the
time is ripe for a renewal of the at
tempt to conclude an Anglo-Russian
entente that will allay the irritation
between the two nations and arrest the
tendencies 'that seem to be hurrying
them to a catastrophe. ,
Lord Lansdowne's methods In this
matter bring to mind his proposal with
regard to the* fiscal question,, when he
recommended Great Britain to provide
herself ..with. a revolver to compel other
nations to reciprocate tariff favors.
Apparently he thinks now that he has
a diplomatic revolver that he can level
at the. head of Russia to induce a rea
sonable frame of mind on the part of
that country. . .
Moreover, the 'King worked assidu
ously to win the good will of Germany
and Austro-Hungary, thus bringing the
triple alliance bodily over, to the side
of the vast bodv of political and moral
force Great- Britain had been organiz
ing for the purpose of increasing her
influence with Russia in the cause of
universal peace, j" , '.Â¦ Â¦ â¢
RUSSIA MUST MAKE TERMS.
At the outset the British Foreign Of
fice, to strengthen Great Britain's posi
tion, concluded a war alliance with
Japan; but Russia continued obdurate.
Then Lansdowne declared â aiming the
statement, as everybody knew, at Rus
siaâthat Great Britain would resist by
force of arms any nation that should
seek a foothold on the Persian Gulf.
This also failed to influence Russia
and the British Foreign Secretary, fol
lowing the lead and personal work of
the King, proceeded to seek an Anglo-
French rapprochement and still closer
relations with Italy. The King and the
Foreign Secretary together succeeded
in effecting a strong sentimental bond
between Britain, France and Italy,
fortified bv a series of arbitration
treaties and, crowned by an arrange
ment for. adjusting Anglo-French dis
putes throughout the world.
ALLIANCE WITH JAPAN.
Downjng street has long earnestly
desired an Anglo-Russian understand
ing. Lord Salisbury recognized the're
lations of Great Britain and Russia
contained elements of war and wanted
to work out an agreement, but the
statesmen of St. Petersburg did not
seem to encourage the idea. They ap
peared to think that Great Britain was
moved by a sense of weakness and
danger, and announced Russian pre
tensions that Lord Salisbury would
not entertain.
LONDON, April 12.â With the sanc
tion and the support of King Edward,
Lord Lansdowne has begun negotia
tions that contemplate an understand
ing with Russia covering the great
political and territorial questions that
divide tbÂ« British and Russian empires.
The proposed agreement,' "according to
the- views of its promoters in both
countries, would be as satisfactory as
the Anglo-French treaty just conclud
ed ana .would open the way for prac
tical plans . for limiting the military
and naval burdens of Europe.

CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. April 12.â Behind the
rrcent rerall from Washington of Gen
ual Hernandez. (El Mocho), there is
a tangle of South American intrigue.
ThÂ«> FUtpension of the Minister's pay.
th<Â» orders for him to return to Caracas
end the abandonment of the legation
in Washington, were the result of cor
respondence between President Castro
end General Hernandez. The general
ii-. now regarded as an enemy by Presi
dent Castro and another revolution
would not be surprising.
El Mocho (thÂ«- maimed or.e) was re
leased from prison by President Castro
during the period when the allied
powers were blockading the Venezue
lan coast. He had been incarcerated
for political reasons. While the Vene
zuelan Minister was here he received
en February 6 a letter from President
Castro in regard to the subject of the
relations between Venezuela and Co
lombia and certain reforms.
General Hernandez had taken Presi
dent Castro to task for not officially
declaring peace in Venezuela, although
it had reigned unbroken for seven
months. He declared Castro was un
der obligation now to release certain
political prisoners who belonged to the
Nationalist party, of which General
Hernandez was a recognized leader.
He complained that his mail was daily
examined in all postoffices of Vene
zuela, which, .he said, was an evidence
that the Venezuelan Government dis
trusted Nationalism.

but absolute obedience. .

Evarts, in his statement, contended
that the Securities Company, in. its

This intervention was something of
a surprise to the petitioners, who were
not aware of it until after Evarts had
opened the case for the plaintiffs, when
Judge Sanborn asked him if he was
aware that the United Spates Govern

read the objection of Knox, which is
as follows:

so. I consented to do what he wanted. It
was understood that Harlan and I together
were to get 10 cents an acre for all the lan<l

ernment official to the stand: ' '.v ".;
"Did you have a conversation; with
John A. Benson regarding the exchange
of .'worthless titles, procured by. forg
ery, for' lands outside the forest \ r&-~
serves?" _/
"No t " the witness replied. '."Â¦ ;'
Miss Doyle corroborated Mrs. Curtis'
testimony as to the "Dear Sir letters"
that were sent by Hyde to officials
at Washington, but admitted that the
defendant made no attempt to conceal
the contents of these letters from his
office staff, although their destination
was known only to himself, he ad
dressing all such communications. Aft
er Grant I. Taggart, the forest super
visor, had been recalled to say* that he
never received any money from Hyde
or! Dimond, Heney asked:
'.'Did you ever receive any money
from Benson?"
McEnerney's objection Â«that this was
not proper cross-examination was sus
tained by the Commissioner, who said
pointedly to Heney, '^'We'll let you
prove that at the proper time.". .

Where powers of attorney were necessaijf
fop the exchange of these base lands' it wits
the custom of the office to have the powers
siRred in blank. We filled these out^wlittn
needed and sent them by the office boy acio.-.v
the street to a notary public, who" added th*"
acknowledgment. The grantors were 1 ' not ;1n
our office at the time, but I caanot say
whether they appeared before the' notary.
These powers. had to be witnessed. V ..myself
witnessed rome of tli'in at Hyde's direction,
without having seen the grantors sign. ' As to
the non-mineral affidavits which' had to ac
cCmpany the selection?, these, too.rwere fcept
In the office in bulk, after being signed- in
blank by Surveyor J. C. Bunner or Burreyor
A. F. Barton. When I needed an affidavit"!
filled out one of these signed blanks with "a
description of the lands and sent the boy
with It over to the notary, who affixed bit
jurat, declaring that It had been sworn to
before him.
Deeds of conveyance of the selected ' lands
were also kept In the office, signed In blank
by the persons whose names had been used
In taking out the selections. This sending
of the office boy with papers to a notaiy
occurred daily. The signer* seldom accom
panied the boy.
Question by the commissioner â Did the of
fice boy generally bring: back the papers 'with
hÂ«m? .
Yes. He might get back in a few minutes
or be away longer, according to the number
of errands he had to do. Some of the deeds
of relinquishment Â¦ were sent over â¢ to Oakland
to . be signed. When they were brought back
I cent them. across the street for the notary's
acknowledgment. Jurt told the office boy,
â¢Take these across to the notary."
The Ortson and California school lands were
sold to the joint Interest of Hyde and B;nson.
and this joint account was kept by W. K.

or "base" land stood on our office books in
the names of F. A. Hyde, F. A. Hyde &. Co.,

Having satisfied McEnerney's curi
osity, Burns was let go, and the de
fense called Miss Marion Doyle, the
young woman who succeeded Mrs.
Belle A. Curtis as stenographer and
confidential cle.rk In Hyde's office,
where she spent the two years ending
In December, 190L Miss Doyle * was
evidently a trusted and competent em
ploye. She told her story without be
traying any malice against Hyde and
with apparent candor. In the main her
testimony formed a sequel .to the sen
sational 'evidence given ' last week by
Mrs. Curtis, but It was somewhat less
damaging to Hyde, as the witness yes
terday was far more conservative than
her* predecessor and limited her an
swers carefully to facts within her
own ken.
ANOTHER WOMAN'S EVIDENCE.
The substance of Miss Doyle's testi
mony, which dealt largely with her
duties, follows:
My esoecia! duties In the office were to
look after the dockets, or books in which we
kept records of all the State school lands In
which Hyde was interested and the applica
tions to the Government for lieu lands, and
to make' up these applications and forward
them, with the proper affidavits, to the regis
ters of the local land offices. While I was
there Hyde sold much "base land." as the
State school land used for lieu sections waa
called. The -purchasers made their own selec
tion*. But when the selections were made tn
our ofUce for Hyde and thow Interested with
him I had to make out all the papers. These
Included the deed of rellnqulKhment to the
United State*, an abstract of title, and gener
ally two powers of attorney. One of these
powers authorized the grantee to make the
selection and Uw other empowered him to sell
the Jand aftet the patent issued. . â¢
Did you know of any titles based on forged
Instruments for lieu lands? - .
No; I did not know that any forgery of
titles was Amtnitted.
The defendant Dimond was - employed by
Hyde as early ae June, 1801, and later in the
year be went to Washington as Hyde's attor
ney In the â¢election fawn that were.drajrgln;;
Uf ore the department. He took with him Â«
One of them contained directions from Hyde
to Allen retarding lands the writer wanted
the superintendent to recommend for Inclu
sion within a proposed forert reÂ«erve. An
other letter told Allen to send Forest Super
visor Grant I. Ta&gart to Hyde. A third di
rected Allen how to go about getting his
homestead tract exchanged for lieu lands with
out the Government's discovering that he wag
the selector. There were other letters from
Hyde, but I do not recall their contents.
"We ask that the Government be di
rected to produce those letters," said
McEnerney, "as we desire to show by
them that they contain nothing of an
incriminatory nature."
"Your client Hyde knows what is in
the letters," Heney responded. "If you
want to show what you say you do,
put him on the stand and let him
swear the letters were innocent. It is
evident, your Honor, as I have said
before, that this whole proceeding is
an effort on Hyde's part to find out
Just how much it will be safe for him
to deny under oath."
Commissioner Heacock denied thÂ»
motion, and then in answer to Mc-
Enerney's 'question, "What was in the
letters?" Burns said:
HYDE ADVISES XULVLS.
William J. Burns, the Government
detective, was called again by the "e
fense and in answer to McEnerney's
questions said that, acting under
Instructions from the Interior ' De
partment, he had taken perhaps
fifteen or sixteen letters from
Allen's .desk. , Only a few of these
were from Hyde, the majority of his
epistles to Allen having come into th? t
Government's possession previously.
"These letters are now at Washing
ton," Burns continued, "in the office
of the Secretary of the Interior."
The first witness called by Garret
TV. McEnerney. of Hyde's counsel, was
Benjamin F. Allen, forest superintend
ent at Los Angeles and one of the wit
r.esses before the Federal Grand Jury
at Washington. Allen had been on the
Fiand before, but told little. Yesterday
he was recalled by the defense, with the
object, as McEnerney told the Commis
sioner, of disproving- the aifegation in
the indictment that he had been an
agent of the alleged conspiracy to ob
tain Government lands* by fraudulent
means. He said he never had any ac
quaintance or correspondence with
Benson, Dimond or Schneider, three
of the indicted men, but had known
and corresponded with Hyde since the
beginning of Harrison's administration
in 1889, when the witness had been ap
pointed forest superintendent of the
Southern California district.
"What hae become of those letters
from Hyde?" McEnerney asked.
"They were taken away from my of
fice last August by Special Agent Wil
liam J. Burns. He took all Hyde's let
ters. I never kept copies of my own
letters to Hyde."
"We demand the Hyde letters," Mc-
Enerney said, turning to the Govern
ment. "We want them to show that
they do not incriminate Hyde."
"You won't . get them." retorted
Heney. "Besides, we have none that
would show Hyde innocent."
"In accordance with my former rul
ings. I shell decline to order the pro
duction of the papers." the Commis
sioner announced. McEnerney con
tinued his examination of the witness,
who told that the only money he had
ever received from Hyde was some $400
paid him for lieu land the witness had
located. Hyde had settled the unpaid
entry fees and overdue taxes and then
paid the witness the balance due at a
purchase price of $3 75 an acre.
PAPERS IIKLD DACK.
Miss Marion L. Doyle, a former clerk
in Hyde's office, told a story similar to
that repeated last week by Hyde's
other woman employe. Mrs. Belle . A.
Curtisâ a narrative of affidavits and
deeds and powers of attorney signed in
blank and in bulk, to be filled out when
needed and cent in bunches in the
hands of an office boy to an accommo
dating notary, who affixed his Jurat or
acknowledgment, as the case might be,
without seeing the affiants or grantors.
William E. Valk, formerly the chief
examiner in the lieu land division of
the General Land Office, told that he
was coj^ptly paid a large sum to ex
pedite the Hyde-Benson selections of
lieu lands. This Fum was paid him
solely for advancing the cases out of
their order, and not for approving cases
that were defective on their face.
Valk's testimory involved both Hyde
and Dimond, but bore most severely
on John A. Beat-on, whom he charged
with making the payments in the In
terest of the two alleged partners in
thÂ«e lieu land business.
Counsel for the defense in the land
fraud case yesterday opened the door
for more of the Government's evidence
against the alleged conspirators. Con
tinuing'their policy of uncovering the
prosecution by calling the Federal wit
nesses to the stand they brought out
testimony of a highly sensational char
acter.

A Rheumatic Mystery
Here are some marvels of medicine!
A dose of Aconite will climax at three
o'clock In the morning.
Aloes will operate at five o'clock A. M.
and Sulphur at eleven o'clock. â¢
No matter what time, m the preceding
day. you have taken these medicines,
they will climax at the fixed hours here
stated and reveal certain symptoms al-
ways.
How do you account for this.
How account for a Itlieumatic per-
son's ability to predict a coming storm
24- hours ahead, by the peculiar ache in
his bones? *
Rheumatism is simply Uric Acid in
the blood. Can Uric Acid have Its tlnw
limit, like other chemicals, but reflect-
ing backward like a barometer? /
Uric Acid is due to a lack of Alkaline
material In the blood. This Acid absorbs .
the debris, or waste matter, of the sys-
tem.
It carries this waste matter into tho
blood, when there are not enough Alka-
line elements (like salt or soda) to
neutralize the Uric AcsG. and to free the
debris before it reaches the kidneys.
As the blood circulates through the
system, it then deposits small particles
of this waste matter in the Joints and
muscles. y
These particles are like granulated
sugar, or sand, and they grind between
the joints and muscles at every move-
ment.
This grinding causes intense pain ami
inflammation, frequently. -If the disease
be not checked, the inflammation will
cause the Uric particles to be coated
with a fleshy cushion, which in time
grows to the Joints aa well. Then "bony
Joints' and crooked limbs ensue.
ThÂ« only way to cure Rheumatism is
to convert the Acid condition of the
blood into an Alkaline. Then to dis-
soH-e. and carry away, the deposits In
joints and muscles.
Then, to get the digestive organs into
a normal condition, so they will secrete,
without further help, less Acid and
more Alkalines. Upon this condition
depends cure, and the permanence of
cure. But â it is useless to kill Rheu-
matism if we also kill the stomach in
doing so.
Few drugs powerful enough . to dis-
solve Uric Acid deposits' are safe to
take into the stomach. This Is why
F-0-^n.lled "quick cures" are dangerous.
Rheumatism is slowly acquired, and
eo, a cure cannot be expected in a few
weeks' treatment, and never by external
applications. The first essential In a
Rheumatic cure is safety â the second,
effectivenessâ the third, permanence.
In a medical experience of thirty years
I have known but one remedy which
combined these three qualities. It took
nearly ten years of my life to discover
and perfect that remedy.
The chief ingredient I found in Ger-
many, and ' to Shis I added, subtracted
Irom. and combined, until I now have a
prescription t>n which I daily stake for-
tune and repute.
After 2000 test cases I found that "Dr.
Shoop's Rheumatic Cure" succeeded in
30 out of each 40 cases. Then I decided
it was safe to supply It on a month's
trial, at my risk, to Rheumatic sufferers
everywhere.
If it fails, the treatment and six bot-
tles of Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure co3t
you not a farthing, and I bear the whole
cost myself without question.
If it succe^dfe. the cost to you is but
$5.50. This Is no mere sample proposi-
tion, but a practical guarantee of suc-
cess or no pay. Write me to-day â before
you forget itâ for my free Treatise on
Rheumatism.

FIGHTING ON THE YALU.
Belief in Tokio That the 'Armies Are
in Combat.
TOKIO, April 12.â It is believed here
that fighting has commenced on the
Yalu River. It is known that the Rus
sians occupy the right bank of the
river in force. c > '?Â¦
Xo direct information from the Yalu
district has been received here, but the
position of the Russians is known, and
while it is doubted that they will be
able to prevent the Japanese crossing
the river, that they will offer some op
position is v regarded as certain. It is
not believed, however, that there will
be any serious engagement during the
Japanese operations to cross the Yalu.
The foreign military observers at
tached to the first Japanese army have
been directed to hold themselves in
readiness to move, and it is expected

Oakland OfficeSan Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. April 12.
Articles of incorporation were filed
with the County Clerk to-day for the
Realty Bonds ar^d Finance Company,
which has been organized in this city
for the extensive handling of local and
suburban real estate. The corpora
tion is capitalized at $1,000,000, with
$100,000 paid up stock, which is held
by the following well known business
men of this city:
Henry A. Butters, John A. Britton,
A. L. Scott, Anson S. Blake. Frank M.
Wilson. B. C. Soule, William Moller,
F. J. Woodward and W. R. Davis.
In addition to the handling of real
estate, the Realty Bonds and Finance
Company will engage in contracting
and building. The officers of the com
pany have not been elected.
The commodious building of the
Yuung Men's Christian Association
was open to visitors last night, the
occasion being the opening of the
H>ririÂ£ term of the extensive educa
tional department. .
A large number took advantage of
the occasion to inspect the practical
work being done ia this department
for young men and working boys. Le
Roy Eurns Smith, B. A., a graduate
of Cornell University, who is the popu
lar and successful educational director,
presided in the auditorium. An illus
trated address was given by the gen
pral secretary. H- J- McCoy, who chose
kr his subject "The Value in a Man."
.Mr. McCoy gave some exceedingly in
teresting figures regarding the educa
tion of young men and boys, stating
that less than fifteen per cent finished
the grammar grades, only five per
cent succeeded in getting through the
high school and only about one in
two thousand completed a college edu
cation. Â«
His address was Illustrated by means
cf the stereopticon and he threw upon
the screen many views of the depart
ments of association work, which made
the address exceedingly practical and
interesting. The educational work has
developed very rapidly under the di
rection of Mr. Smith, and the school
for boys has become so popular and
effective that it is overcrowded and
twenty-five boys are now on the wait
ing list. In response to an increasing
demand, a department for preparing
young men for college and university
has been established with B. F. Ames,
B. A., a gradate of Yale University,
instructor. Mr. Ames will give
special attention to private tutoring.
Nearly thirty Instructors are employ
ed in the night and day schools and
the work Is of a high grade. They take
young men who are foreigners and
cannot speak a word of English and
instruction is given from this point to
college preparation.
The evening law school of the asso
ciation has been successful and has
about completed its third year of thÂ«
four-year course. The association
school is certainlr one of the most
practical lines of educational effort in
our city, and its work is recognized
by more than 115 universities and tol
lcges in the country.
The following are some of the
branches taught: Algebra, arithmetic,
assaying, bookkeeping, business law,
< hemistry. grammar, freehand draw
ing, geometry, steam engineering, nav
al architecture, penmanship, stenog
raphy, typewriting, structural draw
ing, spelling, etc. New'students may
Â«^nter at anytime, and it is expected
large number will take advantage
<f the spring term which opened last
night. The growth of the educational
work ke*Â»ps pace with all other
branches of this large and diversified
work. One of the great needs of the
work to-day is endowment, particular
ly, in connection with the school for
employed boys.

Main Body of Japanese Is in Neigh

SEOUL, Korea, Monday, April 11.â
The Japanese authorities here say there
have been frequent skirmishes between
Sakju and Wiju. The main body of the
first Japanese army Is in the neighbor
hood'of Wiju.
About 600 flat chested, sandal shod
Korean infantrymen left Seoul to-day
'for the northern part of Hamhiiing
Province, on the frontier of the Kirin
district of Manchuria, to keep in or
der the bandits who ' are constantly
embroiled with the Chinese settlers in
the Tumen region, which has resulted
in diplomatic representations on the
subject from China. It is considered
doubtful whether these troops- will
reach their . destination, as fears are
being that they will desert.
I The Japanese Minister has requested
the Korean Government to facilitate
the plans of General Haraguchi, â¢ the
commander of the Japanese forces at
Seoul! for the thorough sanitation | of
Seoul and the other large towns of Ko
rea, so as not to expose tne Japanese
troops to the ravages of cholera and
ether diseases.
QUIET AT .PORT ARTHUR.
Makaroff's Battleships and Torpedo-
Boats Cruise Out to Sea.
PORT ARTHUR. Monday, April" 11.â
Telegraphic communications have been
interrupted recently owing to the torren
tial rains. The raHroad embankments
in South Manchuria have been dam
aged, thus delaying^ the movements of
troops. >The embankment of the rail
road running to Shanhaikwan is sub
merged at several points.
A squadron of battleships and tor
pedo-boats has just returned here from
a cruise far out to. sea.
Easter passed without the expected
Japanese attack.' Every, precaution
was taken to prevent a surprise. Jfice
Admiral Makaroff, who personally su
pervised nightly the precautionary
measures, spent Easter eve in a guard
boat. During the usual Easter- night
service the church' windows were cov
ered so as to prevent the lights being
seen by the enemy, and the absence of
all illumination in the town was a con
stant reminder to the" inhabitants of
the possibility of an attack.. The troops
celebrated . Easter Sunday at . their
posts. Â¦ Â¦ *Â¦?. <:
British Gunboat Espiegle Is Given an
&tr-s .Official Farewell.
DEPARTS FOR XEWCHWAXG.
. NEWCHWANG, April 12.â Prior to
the departure of the British gunboat
Espiegle, which has been stationed
here; during the past winter, at 1
o'clock to-day. Civil ' Administrator
Grosse visited the warship officially.
After this visit the civil administrator,
in company with the Russian local au
thorities, waited on the esplanade
along the water front while the gun
boat steamed past on her way down
the river.
This official ceremony was In recog
nition of the cordial and pleasant re
lations which have existed between the
officers of, the Espiegle and the Russian
authorities during the stay of the Brit
ish gunboat at Newchwang. The de
tention of the Espiegle after the time
originally set for her departure is un
derstood to* indicate the unqualified ac
ceptance by Great Britain of the es
tablishment by the Russians of martial
law at Newchwang, her" agreement to
the plan for the protection of British
Interests here during the war, and the
final restoration of treaty rights. .. .'".-:.
The departure of the Espiegle re
moves a cause of embarrassment, to the
Russian authorities, and enables- them
to put into execution a system of mar
tial law consistent. with the demands
of the situation. She. was the last for
eign warship at Newchwang, the Unit
ed States gunboat Helena having left
here ten days ago.
" The last of the merchant. steamships
left Newchwang to-day, and the ship
ping companies have notified their
agents to send no more vessels here;
consequently it is expected that hence
forth commerce will be practically at a
standstill.
The streets of Newchwang are no
longer lighted at night, and the move
ments of boats on the river at night is
prohibited.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 12.â The
Emperor has received a telegram re
porting that all is quiet at Port.Ar
thur; that the naval squadron is again
putting out to sea, and that Vice Ad
miral Makaroff has sent a few torpedo
boat destroyers to explore the coasts,
where some of the enemy's torpedo-,
boats are believed to be lurking."
Circassians are volunteering in large
numbers for service in the Far East.
About 12,000 have been enrolled in the
Kouban district, each man paying for
his own horse and equipment.
The Government has agreed, in re
sponse to the representations of the
United States authorities, to show as
much consideration as possible to the
two Japanese taken by the Russians
from the American newspaper corre
spondents' steamship at Newchwang
and who are held under suspicion of
being spies.
In accordance with his annual cus
tom, the Emperor this afternoon re
viewed the Empress Horse Guards,- the
crack cavalry regiment of the empire,
in their riding school on the Horse
Guard boulevard, the occasion being
the feast erf- the regiment's patron
saint. Before an embowered stand oc
cupied by the imperial party, including
the Empress and the highest ladies of
the court, the Emperor, in the Guards
uniform, reviewed the splendid looking
troopers in white tunics and burnished
cuirasses and helmets.
Those present remarked that the Em
peror did not look as ' well as usual.
His voice, when he congratulated the
regiment, lacked its accustomed ring.
The review concluded with the pictu
resque ceremony of saluting the colors,
which occurred outside in full view of
thousands of spectators. The troopers
then proceeded to the refectory, where
the Emperor tasted their soup, drank
their health and distributed a* gratuity
of $1 50 to the non-commissioned offi
cers and 50 cents to the troopers. Later
the colonel and other officers of the
regiment were banqueted in the" Win
ter Palace.
Detachments of each of the guard
regiments yesterday at the Winter Pal
ace conveyed Easter greetings to. the
Emperor and Empress. The Emperor
kissed each of the guardsmen thrice,
the Empress giving her hand to be
kissed and presenting each guardsmen
with a decorated china egg. The serv
ants of the palace were similarly hon
ored. : ;"\
ST. PETERSBURG, April 12. â Gen- I
eral Kuropatkin. in a dispatch to the
1-mperor bearing to-day's date, says
that General Krasma.lir.ski, on the
right of April 8, ordered a detachment
of sharpshooters to cross to the left
bank of the Yalu opposite Wiju. The
sharpshooters landed on the island of
Samallnd and surprised a patrol of
fifty Japanese scouts tis the latter, in
three boats, were approaching the cast
tide of the island. The Russians al
lowed the Japanese to land and then
tired upon them. Nearly all of the
Japanese were shot, bayoneted or
drowned and their boats were sunk.
The Russians sustained no losses.
On the following day the Japanese
lowered their flag at Wiju ami their
outposts, which lately have bee^ seen,
fell back.
On the night of April 9 four Rus
sians crossed the Yalu to Yongampho
und made toward a Russian village,
where they found a squadron of Jan
j:n*Â»Â«3e cavalry. They remained there
twelve hour?;, when they were be
trayed by Koreans and found them
selves obliged to swim the river, their
boat having struck on a sandbar. One
soldier lost his life. The Japanese pur
sued the Russians in a boat, but were
in turn attacked by a Russian boat
which had come to the rescue of the
FYvimmers. All of the Jipnnese were
killed and their boat was sunk.
General Kuropatkin's report to the
Emperor of the annihilation of Japa
rcso detachments on the Yalu River
creates general satisfaction in official
circles. Again, in thÂ«Â» view of the of
ficials, a Russian soldier has proved
his Fupcriorfty in strategy and in the
manner of attack, which left no chance
for a single enemy to escape.
â¢ One feature of the message which la
not pleasing to the authorities is the
action of the Koreans in revealing to
the Japanese the presence of the Rus
sians at Yongampho. The belief pre
vails that the Koreans are not so un
friendly to the Japanese as has been
announced. Incidents such as that at
"Yongampho indicate that the view
held.of the Korean attitude is a mis
taken one.
According to telegraphic advices re
ceived by the Novosti from its corre
spondent at Liaoyang a bombardment
of Port Arthur and a fight on the Yalu
are expected momentarily.
TOKIO, April 13.â Details of the first
skirmish on the Yalu River, which oc
curred last Sunday, arrived .to-day in
the official report of Admiral Hosoga.
The text of the report follows:
"In accordance with my Instructions,
the captain of the cruiser Kasaga di
rected Lieutenant Yamaguchi with five
men to scout in the mouth of the Yalu.
They accomplished their work and
safely returned to the Kasaga on Mon
day. They entered the river in a Ko
rean junk, and at 2 o'clock Sunday
discovered a party of Russians leav
ing the right bank of the river near
Toagtoi yuhe in a junk.
"Lieutenant Yamaguchi attacked
them, a patrol of mounted Japanese
troops on the left bank of the river
joining in. the attack. In the meantime
another large Russian junk joined the
first one and opened fire on the Japan
ese. The Russians retired and reached
the bank. They then fled inland. The
exchange of fire lasted an hour and
twenty minutes. The enemy had one
killed and two wounded. We had no
casualties. Four hundred empty car
tridges were found in the Russian
junk. We believe the Russians were a
cavalry patrol watching the river."

purposes.
A resolution will be introduced by
Senator Bard requesting President
Roosevelt to have the question fully
inquired into with a view to establish
ing the rights of and protecting private
parties in diverting its waters for Irri
gation purposes.. All parties Interested,
for and against the bill, accept the res
olution as the best alternative. The bill

scarcely enough blankets left to keep
them warm. They wagered ponies,
dogs, blankets, wearing apparel, coon
skins, firearms and gewgaws of, all
sorts. The gambling wan in a large

four miles above the Northern Pacific
bridge on the Olympia branch.
The disk was used in gambling. The

fine. The Indian npjiosite guesses which
side holds the disk. If correct it counts
a point for his side. They played for
500 points.

John T. Jewell of the "Press" office
wrltea: "My wife suffered for many
years with x-arlous Kidney complaints
and particularly diabetes. She was treat-
ed by physicians and tried many adver-
tised remedies faithfully without benefit
until Fulton's Compound .was recom-
mended. It lias surely removed the
cause of the trouble in this case"
O. McLnu jrh! in Of 2648 Sixth are
Troy: 'Several months apo a relative
(calling on me was surprised to note how
poorly I looked. In answer to his in-
quiry u to the trouble. I told him my
Kidneys were In bad shape. He told mo
of Fulton's Renal Compound. I laughed
lit him. I did not believe In it. He.
however, bought a bottle and I beiran
taking It. The morning following I was
rrattned to note Ie*s pain. I had never
believed up to that time that medicine
would do much good. I continued to take
II and grew gradually well. I now con-
Klder myself cured and have stopped the
treatment.**
James Doherty. TO Jay Rt.. Troy: "My
Kidney trouble was due to a bicycle In-
jury. Medical treatment 'never reached
It till J started on Fulton's Renal Com-

STORY OP THE ATTACK [
>v Â¦; BY WOOD CONFIRMED
Repulsed, Americans Suffering
Slight Losses.
Forces Under Sultan of Taraca Are
MANILA, April 12. â News has been
received here confirming Major Gen
eral Leonard Wood's official report of
the result of his operations in Min
danao.
With 1500 men General Wood re
cently started a campaign to compel
the allegiance - .' the Sultan of Tara
ca, in Mindanao. He has pacified .the
eastern side of Lake Lanao, where the
Sultan lived. The American"- casual
ties were two men killed, three men
seriously wounded l and three men
slightly wounded, A number of the
enemy's forts were destroyed. The
Sultan of Taraca, Datto Ali and the
leaders of the opposition to the Amer
ican authority succeeded in making
their escape.
Root occupied less than an hour, but
every word was followed with the
closest attention by the throng of at
torneys and spectators who crowded
the courtroom and the galleries and
who sat on even the tables and the
steps leading to the tribunal.
Root's argument was finished just
before noon, and when the court re
sumed at 2 o'clock Judge Lovett began
his argument for the petitioners. He
began with the contention that if the
Northern Securities Company, had been
the legal owner of stock of the North
ern Pacific and the Great Northern
companies it would have been entitled
to thÂ« fruits of that ownership, and the
Attorney General would not have ob
tained the relief tie sought in the orig
inal suit. The foundation of the bill
in that case was that the stock had
been acquired and held for an illegal
purpose.
STOCK IN* COURT'S CUSTODY.
The decree of the court had deter
mined that no title to the stock ever
passed to the Northern Securities Com
pany, because that company was not
legally capable of. holding such title.
The decree further had the effect of
giving the court practical custody of
the stock of the Northern Securities
Company.
The petitioners, he said, were not
asking the courts to wind up the af
fairs nor dissolve the securities com
pany. They were asking it to dispose
of the stock in what they contended
was the only way consistent with the
decree of the court. The plan of distri
bution proposed by the Northern Se
curities Company did not dissolve that
corporation. It simply reduced or at
tempted to reduce its stocks in such a
manner as would leave the stockholders
In control of both roads.
He referred to the statement of coun
sel for the Northern Securities Com
pany to the effect that the company
might have sold its stockholdings, and
denied this, because the decree of the
court determined that it had never
owned that stock. It was not necessary
to enjoin a corporation from selling the
stock because it \ is < not customary [ to
enjoin any one from selling what | he
does not own. The 'stock was as much
in the constructive custody of the court
as if it had seizedlt.
When Lovett concluded, former Con
gressman . James Hamilton , Lewis .' of
Chicago appeared and said that he rep
resented the Continental Trust Com
pany of New Jersey, and asked - to be
heard as an objector, to : the , petition".
The court then allowed him * fifteen
minutes. He said his client was; the
owner of 5000 shares of the stock of the
Northern Securities 'Company ~. and Â¦ ob
jected to the petition: being 1 granted,
because the court; had- no jurisdiction.
The court adjourned the case until 10
o'clock to-morrow morning, when one
hour and fifteen -minutes will be al
lowed for further; argument. .}

HARRIMAI FINDS KNOX AIDING HILL
BARCELONA. April 12. â Premier
Maura was attacked to-day by an an
archist while entering the palace of
the Council General. The Premier
had just returned from attending a
requiem service for the repose of the
soul of the late Queen Isabella and
was entering the palace, when a
youth. 19 years old, named Joaquin
Miguel Artao, approached and, shout
ing "Good day; long live anarchy,"
stabbed the Premier in the chest. Ar
tao was immediately Seized and im
prisoned.
Late to-night a semi-official report
of the attack on Premier Maura was
issued, according to which the assail
ant had concealed a kitchen knife
with which he stabbed the Premier,
but the force of the blow was broken
and its direction diverted by the heavy
lace on the Minister's coat, resulting
in only a slight scratch under the
sixth rib. A doctor attached to King
Alfonso's suite examined the Premier
and prescribed a few hours' rest. His
Majesty sent a messenger to inquire
concerning the attack and as to the
Premier's condition.
Joaquin Miguel Artao, the assailant,
was employed as a domestic. He is an
anarchist and when arrested attempt
ed suicide by dashing his head against
the wall. /
â¢ According to another account the
Premier coolly drew the knife from
his clothing and threw it on a seat
in his carriage, after which he en
tered the palace, walked upstairs and
telephoned to Minister of the Interior
Guerra at Madrid, saying: "I have
been stabbed. Don't be alarmed. The
wound. is not serious."

THE PREMIER
LONDON, April 12.â The Govern
ment, according to the Evening News,
has decided to reimpose the grain du
ties abandoned by former Chancellor
of the Exchequer Ritchie. The paper
added that the former arrangement of
six cents per hundredweight on im
ported grain and ten cents on flour will
be revived in its entirety, as during the
regime of former Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Sir Michael Hicks-Beach. The
announcement that the grain duties
will be reimposed found little credence
among the members of the House of
Commons, who anticipated that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer will make
up the deficit largely from an increase
in the income tax.
The combined efforts of the coal
owners, exporters, ship owners and
miners have failed to induce Austen
Chamberlain, the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer, to repeal the coal duty. An
important deputation representing all
of these interests laid the case before
the Chancellor to-day and pleaded that
the duty was disastrous to every in
dustry connected with the coal trade
and enabled their German and other
rivals to displace British coal.
Chamberlain, in reply, lengthily com
pared the arguments of the petitioners
with the facts in his possession and
concluded with denying that there was
any reason for the abolition of the
duty. He said the fact that the exports
for the past year were the largest on
record disproved the gloomy forebod
ings of the deputation.
Â» '*
Chancellor of the Exchequer
Ignores Requests for Abo
lition of the Coal Duty
SHIPPERS ARE OPPOSED
On amatory conquest bent and with
money to spend, Pat Sullivan, miner,
came down from Butte City, Mont.,
where he had exhausted the list of fair
ones he considered worth flirting with.
The fame of San Francisco as a beauty
phov- attracted him, and when he ar
rived here he sallied forth to conquer.
Fate led him to 195 Shipley street, a
lodging-house owned l>y Mrs. Catherine
Reynolds, and there misfortune over
took both him and the lady. She was
the defendant on a grand larceny
charge in Judge Mogan's court, and
Fat Sullivan was her accuser.
Mrs. Reynolds pleaded not guilty,
and then recounted her experience with
the Adonis from Butte. He entered her
establishment, she stated, and said he
desired to rent a room, and as her live
lihood v.as derived from the renting of
rooms ehe treated him civilly and said
she would be pleased to have him for a
lodger. Then his conduct became ec
jcentrle. Dropping upon his knees, he
clasped his hands appeallngly, address-
Ing her as "queen of his soul" and de
clared his senses were enslaved by her
charms. Then, proposing that she toast
him ln beer, he rushed out. to return a
moment later with a bottle of that
beverage. Conaldering him demented
and being alone and afraid, the
""queen" humored his fancy by drink-
Irg a glass of th<? beer. With renewed
assurances of his imperishable affec
tion, he then withdrew. A few hours
later she was arrested on a warrant
charging her with having stolen 545
from Mr. Sullivan.
Examinod by the Judge. . the com
plainant confessed that he could not
prove the defendant guilty of robbery.
"This woman is discharged." raid the
court, "and I think her arrest was an
outrage. The complainant has proved
â¢nothing more than that he was a fool,
and I hope he will return to Butte as
ppeedily as possible. The issuance of a
warrant on his unsupported complaint
was unjustified."
Mr. Sullivan looked like anything
fxcopt a typical squire of dames as he
walked out of court.
â¢ â¢ â¢
A dispute over the rightful posses-
Fion of a silver dollar led to such seri
ous trouble between Mr. and Mrs. EX.
SoHnski of 31 Ivy avenue that the man
retired to escare the woman's wrath.
"When he had given her ample time for
restoration of reason he returned, to
find that she had barred the door
jicainst him. and then he became
wrathful and smashed the window.
Neighbors heard the crash, imagined
burglar?, raised Fashes and blew
(vhfstles. and in affright Mr. So'.inski
tVd. At the intersection of Larkin and
Hayes streets he ran into the arms of
a iwliceman. and that's how he hap
j^ned to be a defendant before Judge
Mugan. The case is under advisement.

Joseph Fried!, fair complexioned.

Into the shop he roik'd. and addressing

that he wanted a cigarette. In tone of
[frvezfasj dignity she said she *ould not

ciplinarian, but as he made his exit he
I'!ayful!y smashed a window.

So frequently has alleged peace dis
turbance on the 1500 block of York
street. Bernal Heights, been ventilated
in the Police courts that most
of thÂ»Â» feminine dwellers in that
reighborhood have become rather
familiar figures in the corridors
of the Hall of Justice. A large
batch of them basked in the presence
of Judge Cabaniss yesterday morning,
end in the afternoon they entertained
Judge Fritz and a jury. In the former
tribunal Mrs. Lizzie Heller was ac
cused of having disturbed the peace
of Mrs. Jane Doe Daw, and before the
twelve good men and true the same
Sirs. Lizzie Heiler declared that her
p^ace had been disturbed by Siegfried
Magpr and Mary, his wife.
In both cases the witnesses were
numerous and voluble. Their testi
mony showed that the turbulent condi
tion of the 1500 block antedated the
taking up of residence there by Mrs.
Heil<?r. Indeed the lady seems to be
yet in the early stage of an initiation
that ie progressing with remarkable
rapidity. The tumult began when Mrs.
Magcr was arrested for disturbing th*
3>e*ce of Mrs. McCarthy, and Mrs. Ma-
I ger celebrated her acquittal by enter
ing civil *suit against Mrs. Mc-
Carthy and being awarded 55000 dam
ages, not one cent of which she has
been able to collect. From the Mager-
McCarthy feud grew side issues that
gradually involved the majority of
the!r respective friends and proved
rich picking for the Police Court law
yers.
So distracting was the testimony in
the Daw-Heller case that his Honor
Cabaniss sot the sides mixed and pro
nounced the complainant guilty; and
when her attorney vigorously protested
the court squared matters by dismiss
ing the defendant. Mrs. Daw swore
that the Heller family made her life
a burden by casting rocks through the
windows of her domicile, and Mrs. Hel
ler submitted in evidence the fragments
of a glass pitcher which, she alleged,
had been hurled at her by Mrs. Daw.
The Judge ungallantly suggested that
the fact of Mrs. Daw's aiming the
pitcher at Mrs. Heiler assured that
lady immunity from being struck with
the missile, as a woman never hits the
object she throws at-
While Mrs. Heller was testifying in
her own behalf Mrs. Daw sat among
the witnesses and groaned most mis
erably to express the horror conveyed
to her by the defendant's statements.
An attempt by one of the attorneys to
prove the existence of a tender attach
ment between a policeman and one of
the younger witnesses was balked by
the court declaring that the love af
fairs of the witness had nothing to do
with the case.
After listening: to tedious testimony
ard equally tedious arguments in Mrs.
Hc-iler's case apair.st the Magers, the
Jury in Judge Fritz's court convicted
the woman and acquitted the mail.
Mrs. Ma ger will be sentenced to-day.

Three persons accused cf murder
faced Judpe Conlan yesterday. Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin was one of them, and
the other two were Fred Tobelmann
and Thomas Fallon, each charged with
slaying his wife. Tobelmann's exam
ination was continued till next Wednes
day, and Fallon will face the bench
again to-day.
â¢ â¢ â¢
From Bernal Heights came wit
nesses to testify in the peace
disturbance case of Mrs. Sum
merville against Ellen Kelly
and Judge Cabaniss gave them
patient hearing. The prosecu
tion alleged that Mrs. Summerville had
tapped the window of Mrs. Kelly's
kitchen and that when Mrs. Kelly
responded she was informed by Mrs.
Pummerville that she (Mrs. S.) would
send her iMrs. K.) to join her (Mrs.
K.'s) husband at San Quentin, supple
menting that threat with another to
the effect that she (Mrs. S.) would
derive grrea\ pleasure from the act of
carving her (.Mrs. K.) with a knife.
Mrs. Summerville denied that she ever
uttered the remarks credited to her by
Mrs. Kelly.
"What started this rumpus, any
way?" demanded the Judge.
Then came Mrs. Strosser and Mrs.
Coleman to testify that the Kelly chil
dren* and the Summerville offspring
were at outs and that their respective
parents took sides, of course. Further
inquiry elicited the information that
not one of the youngsters referred to
was over three years of age.
"I'll have to think this thing over."
was the Judge's wearily uttered opin
ion.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Judge Fritz has reserved his decision
in the assault case in which Policeman
T. J. Larkin is complainant and John
Nolan Jr., a California-street stable
man, is defendant. The officer shows
no evidence of having been roughly
treated, but Nolan exhibits a broken
nose and other facial disfigurements
as a result of the encounter.

Into the street. He died in a few
minutes after the accident. Fox was
about 35 years old and unmarried. He
lived at the Hastings Hotel, Emery

body.

It is a particularly venomous' little
pest and would not hesitate to even
kill a tree a million times bigger than
itself. A crowd of parasites were set
upon it last year by the" university
scientists; but these entomological po
licemen have been off their beats so
long that the phryga.nidia Californica
has become bold and burglarious.
The oak moth is in its infancy Just
nowâ that is, it is in the*embryotic state
and just able to crawl. If the" Hillside
Club women had not taken measures to
suppress the^oth itwould sprout wings
soon and take to eating up the oak
leaves.
The Hillside Club, the organization of
enterprising women that has done so
much to beautify North Berkeley, has
taken steps to save the oak trees of
their section of town from the ravages
of the oak moth, that pernicious little
irisect known to science by the compli
cated name of phryganidia Californica.
A campaign against the moth has been
arranged for, and to-morrow will see
the quietus of thousands of the bugs.
It is all the work of the Hillside women.
The campaign will be carried on with
the help of the university. It will be as
spectacular as it promises to 'be ef
fective. Professor Warren T. Clark*,
the entomologist, and his spraying ap
paratus will be there, and so will A. L.
Bolton, superintendent of the univer
sity grounds, and Charles L. Keeler,
the poet, all of whom have agreed to
help the ladies. Of course, the Iadie3
will be there, too, and altogether it
looks as if there were little chance for
the oak moths of the section.
Professor Clarke intends to dose the
insects with paris green. This will be
administered with the aid of a portable
pumping plant, ladders forty feet long
and expert tree climbers. There are
sixty trees in the Scenic Tract, and It is
calculated that it will take all day and
perhaps some of the next to get around
to all of them. .

Professor H. C. Myers of the chem

of the faculty researchers. He caught
three pep flies in one inning, fanned
the air five times, stole three bases
and caught Scott Hendricks between
second and third. Professor Myers was
the patriarch of the nine, having whis
kers that he had to tuck under his
vest.

BERKELEY, April 12.â The faculty
of the University of California and the
Skull and Keys men played the annual
game of baseball this afternoon on the
college campus, and the Skull and Keys
won by a score of 18 to 16. It was a
heroic exhibition of the national pas
time and has no parallel in history.
That is. the scientists in the game
never saw anything like it in all their
researches, and it is doubtful if any
body else ever did. It looked like a
skirmish drill or a sprightly game of
follow the leader.
Some of the fouls the professors
struck were as loud as tne prehistoric
egg 2,700,000 years old that recently
broke in South Hall. The errors were
bo rank that some of them were pre
served for chemical analysis In the de
partment designed for such things.
They were as abundant as they were
various. The base hits were on the
order baseballus glganticus and of sjich
a new and strange variety that they
are supposed to have something to do
with^ the tertiary period. As history
repeats itself, the professors' believe
that some of the base running was
almost equal to t{iat of the famous
leaguers of the stone asre.
Both wills have been filed for pro
bate. Johii Havens has filed the last
will on behalf of the infant, while Mrs.
Havens* brothers have filed the first
one, and allege that their sister was
incompetent to rrtake a will at the
time of her death.
In the meantime Havens has been
appointed Epecial administrator of the
estate pending the settlement of the
will contest. He claims that all infor
mation in regard to the estate is being
withheld from him by the brothers.
Shortly after her marriage to Hav
ens Mrs. Havens made a will in
which she bequeathed to her four
brothrrs all of her interest in her
father's estate, amounting to about
*40,000. About a year ago Mrs. Havens
gave birth to a son, and her death fol
lowed shortly afterward. When upon
her deathbed Mrs. Havens made an
other will revoking the first and leav
ing everything of which she died pos
sessed to the child.
John R. Havens of Berkeley, as spe
cial administrator of his deceased
wife's estate, wants possession of her
fortune, and to this end has filed a pe
tition with the courts to have James
M. Goewey, his brother-in-law, cited to
appear in court and show the condition
of the estate of the deceased.
There, is a quarrel on between the
brothers of the late Gertrude Goewey
Havens and the surviving husband
over the estate of the deceased, and
Havens, in his petition to-day, states
that James M. â¢ Goewey, as secretary
of the Goewey Estate Company, is
withholding large sums of money due
as dividends on stock belonging to the
late Mrs. Havens.

The negTO is charged with killing the
policeman on December 2a, 1902. God
ley admits being present, and having a
row with the officer. He stated to-night
that he and a party of negroes had
been to a dance in Pittsburg, and
about 2 o'clock in the morning * were
standing in the stairway making some
noise. Policeman Hinkle came along
and told them to keep quiet, and they
not obeying he arrested Godley.
The officer' pulled his club and God
ley struck him, knocking him down.
In falling the officer fired his revolver,
the bullet making a slight wound over
G6dley's eye. Godley states he then
started to run, and presently he heard
another shot. He thought the officer
was shooting at him, but later learned
that some one in the crowd had shot
the officer. Godley denies committing
the murder and says he was not armed.
The negro then went to his home at
West City, twelve miles away, where
he stayed a day or so and then went
to Indian Territory.
Godley joined Norris & Rowe's show
in Wichita and spent the winter with
them in San Jose. He has been going
under the name of Joe Kelly. The
prisoner's brother was in Jail at the
time of the murder of Policeman Hin
kle, and when Joe Godley could not be
found a mob took the brother from
jail and lynched him. Godley said to
night that he certainly would be
lynched as soon as he reached Kan
sas, as a mob would take him from
the train.
Joe Godley, a negro, is in Jail here
awaiting the arrival of an officer from
Pittsburg, Kans., to take him back
there toi answer for the murder of Po
liceman Hinkle. Godley, who has been
following a circus show, was arrested
at Oakland to-day by,. Deputy Sheriff
Dreischmeyer of San Jose and Detec
tive Kyte of this city.

Teller replied that he had known
General Thomas and considered him a
man as worthy of credence as the Il
linois Senator. To this Hopkins re

ment here, I should judge that he
would be as willing to ' take a state

WASHINGTON, April 12. â A sharp
colloquy occurred in the Senate
day between Senators Teller and Hop
kins, growing out of the reading by
Teller of a letter written by the late
General H. H. Thomas of Chicago at
tacking the civil service administra
tion of the Treasury Department.
While Teller was reading General
Thomas' letter Hopkins- entered the
chamber and at its conclusion inter
rupted the Colorado Senator with an
inquiry as to the purport of > his re

such an exhibition of bad raaners on
the part of the Illinois Senator_he
would decline to yield further to him
or have anything further to do with
him. â¢' . . , â¢ : \ Â¦ yr-f^M
Hopkins said he had no intention of
making any attack on the'Colorado
Senator. He was, however, entirely fa
miliar with the Thomas letter and
knew that its writing had been dictat
ed by spite, as* he' knew also ; that the
course of the Secretary, as well as his
own course in â¢ the matter, had been
open and in the interest of the, public
service.
Cullom. said' General Thomas had
been his personal friend and that he
had stood by General Thomas 'up' to
the time of his removal. He said Gen
eral Thomas was sincere in believing
himself' a good appraiser, but, said
Cullom, "I; think! the Secretary of the
Treasury probably was justified in re
moving him." , . _ . . ,
The postofflce appropriation bill was
passed. '
After IL<^ reading Bartlett said that
whenever Mr. Cleveland's name was
suggested as a possible candidate of
the Democrats for President the Re
publicans seemed to get very excited
and afraid. Bartlett added:
"I know he will not be nominated.
I know, too, that he does not desire to
be nominated."
He said he also knew that the Dem
ocratic party would nominate- some
one who was a true Democrat,
and he added with some deliberation:
: ,"It is not very difficult now to state
who' that .will be.".'
"Does the gentleman know, who it
"I have received a number of in
quiries similar to yours touching my
invitation to Frederick Douglas to a
wedding reception and signing while
Governor of New York of a bill pro
viding for mixed schools.
"I do not suppose that Thomas E.
Watson believed or had any reason to
believe either of the allegations when
he made them. At any rate they are
both utterly and absolutely false.
"I cannot afford to devote a - great
deal of time in denying such foolish
tales. I shall therefore attempt to
cover every phase of the subject now

cither when sleeping or waking, alive

decided to do any of these things,
neither the fear of Mr. Watson or any
one else would fiave prevented me.
When I was Governor a movement
was made in the Legislature to abolish
separate colored schools in Xew York
City. I opposed the measure and it
failed. I do not find that I interposed
a veto, and I have forgotten the
course the matter took, but I know
that whatever I did was in favor of

to uplift the negro race gently, sanely
and in the proper way. The South
had the kindliest feeling for the negro.
Bartlett of Georgia caused to be
read the following letter from ex-
President Cleveland, dated March 4,
1904, in reply to one from himself:
it would be physically impossible for
any counsel to prepare a motion for
a new trial. and attend the-prelimi
nary hearing. The defendant says to
the court, "Don't allow them to crush
me down, but give me* time. to employ
counsel to represent me.* "
The defendant was arraigned, and
when asked by the Judge what was
her true name, Heggerty replied, "Cor
delia Botkin."
â¢ The Judge said he would grant a
motion for a reasonable continuance,
and Heggerty suggested Monday morn
ing.
District Attorney Byington said he
did net understand that the law con
templated any. delay. It says that a
defendant shall immediately be brought
before a committing magistrate. A
continuance could only be granted* by
affidavit. It was not going to be a
trying ordeal for the defendant and
he thought she would be glad herself
to have it over. He suggested ' this
afternoon.. The Judge continued the
case till to-morrow morning, when the
examination of the Delaware witnesses
will be commenced.
WAXTS REASOXABLE TIME.
"All the defendant asks is a reason
able time. Under all the circumstances
"I understand," continued Heggerty,
"that the avowed purpose of the prose
cution in this matter is to take the
testimony of the witnesses from Dela
ware, so that they can return to their
homes and never come to this city
again. That testimony, I understand,
would be used at the trial in the Supe
rior Court. Such a purpose is obviously
at variance with the law of the State.
A witness at a preliminary hearing is
required to give security to be present
at the trial, and, failing that, he would
be sent to jail. Why should a. witness
from Delaware have any greater rights
in this regard than a witness living In
this State?
i Cook on Saturday for sentence and
j her attorneys were busily engaged In
! preparing a motion for a new trial to
; be submitted at that time. That would
! occupy all their time and attention.
I All the defendant asked was for reas
j onable time to get counsel of her own
choice.

Police Judge Conlan's courtroom was
crowded with men and women yester
day morning, all eager to gaze upon
the pathetic figure of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin, the convicted murderess, when
she appeared for arraignment on the
charge of murdering Mrs. Ida Hen
rietta Deane by sending a box of pois
oned candy to Mrs. Elizabeth Dun
ning K Mrs. Deane's sister, to Dover,
Del., in August, 189S. Those who saw
Mrs. Botkin in court yesterday and
the day before freely expressed the
opinion that if she were shamming ill
ness she was a consummate actress.
As she was led into the courtroom
by Deputy Sheriff Johnston she kept
her eyes on the floor and never raised
them during the entire proceedings. As
Williams of Mississippi said it was
an old game, known a long time to
those who knew anything about
American politics, that when the Re
publican party found itself faced with
issues that threatened its supremacy
it began to wave the bloody shirt one
v.ay or another. He said, however,
there was one thing neither the Re
publican party nor the entire world
Â¦ could do, and that was "to make the
South consent to regard social equal
ity as a thing to be desirefc." Xor
t-ould they make the South consent to
the proposition that the right of the
negro consisted in giving him jjÂ°w er
:o govern the white men of the South.
He declared tho n?gro's rights in the
BftaXh were recognized much more
abundantly than anywhere else.
"The Republican party," he said,
"cannot persuade Southern white men
that it is not a good or humane thing
to maintain in the South the white
man's civilization and to perpetuate
there the two things upon which it
was founded â the white man's code of
rthics and the sanctity of the white ,
man's family."

by the 'insertion in a pending appro

the tone of the discussion of the Cab

moves in that direction already have

exclusion and the.probable necessity for
legislative or executive action in view
of the denunciation by China of the ex
isting treaty was again to-day the
principal tonic of discussion at the
meeting of the Cabinet. The President
and his advisers were in session for
more than two ; hours. They consid

"Having reached this conclusion, the

that, in its opinion, it would be well
to; make as formal as may be and to
restrain within the narrowest possible
limits the. action of members in con
nection with postoffices and the details
of other executive matters, and that
the severance of members from work
of that character would augment the
efficiency of the House of Representa

WASHINGTON, April 12.â The re

House appointed to investigate the re
port of the * PostofHce Department,

EVERYBODY in the United States who takes an in
terest in politics ! knows that the Brooklyn Eagle
desires above all things to see Grover Cleveland
re-elected to the Presidency. He also knows that the
desire of the Eagle will never be gratified. It is very
easy for the American people to have too much of Grover,
and they have had a great deal. of him already. Such
being the case, it may be interesting to those who like to
watch the curves of politics to note that the Eagle; de
prived of air hopes of its first choice, turns aside with an
easy flippancy and nominates as its second, choice a man
whom it describes as "the editor, of the New * York
Journal" and names as Arthur Brisbane. .
In advocating the; claims! of its second best candidate
the Eagle says: "The justice ofjiewspaper men every

Journal as Mr. Brisbane; This is as true of the multi
plied forms and reissues ' of, that paper in Boston, in Chi

as, it is in. the borough of, Manhattan: Mr. Brisbane is
as simultaneous as the" light, as pervasive as the- air, as
ubiquitous as a New jersey mosquito, yet as ; impersonal as
fate itself. His name nowhere appears in his productions.
Many of them actually appear underÂ»or over, the name of
quite another person. There are those who , believe
that he has made that other man, as the Lord made' the
Â¦vyorld, by the word of his power, 4 in the space of six days,
and all very good, or as. good as could be expected. But
Mr. Brisbane has never claimed this. He-is as: modest
as he is anonymous or as he is, so to say, multi hominous.'

CHESSâ W. M.. Oakland, Cal. The
origin of chess is unknown. Many
learned scholars have written upon the
subject, appealing to history and phil
ology to support their assertions and
theories. It has been , ascribed to a
Chinese Mandarin named Han Sing,
who, it is said, invented ' It as "an
amusement for his soldiers when In
winter quarters about' 174 B. C. It was
called the science of war. ' Sir William
Jones, the great Sanscrit scholar,
claimed that {Hindu traditions, the
names of the pieces and . other partic
ulars indicate that chess was played
in India in its earliest times. In his
vorks he set forth that a learned
Brahmin had assumed him that the
game is mentioned' in several 'of the
oldest* books of India, in which it is
declare*! that it was invented by the
wife of one of the most ancient Kings
of Ceylon to -amuse that monarch
while Rama was besieging his me
tropolis/ This by the "reckoning" in In
dia ; was between two and three thou
sand I years prior to the Christian era.
Other Sanscrit scholars think the game
was : invented in India i by Buddhists
some time between the third and ninth
centuries, A. D., but this theory is in
consistent .with -.: the Â¦/ unwarllke nature
of the Buddhists, and the fact that the
Hindu name ' of the game, "chaturan
ga,". is a military name, signifying the
game / of :; armies, corresponding with
the /Chinese name for 5 chess. -
A DARK HORSE.
When Diamonds Burn.
"Ladies to whom their jewels are
precious should regard their treasures
with greater regard to-day," says the
St. James Gazette of March 23, "for
this is the anniversary of the discovery
that, diamond is but carbon like unto
charcoal and blacklead, arid at the
proper temperature friable as either.
It was in the Academy del Cimento at
Florence that Faraday and Sir Hum
phrey Davy made the experiment,
using the great burnk.g-glass of the
Duke of ; Tuscany for the purpose.'^ '-'A
glass globe was exhausted of air and
filled with pure oxygen.' The diamond
was supported in the center of 'this
globe by a rod of platinum, to the ! top
of which a cradle or cup was fixed, to
allow a free circulation of the gas
about the' diamond. The burning
gl^ss consisted of; two double convex
lenses, each ./distant , from the other
about 3% feet. The heat from the
sun was concentrated upon the dia
mond for three-quarters of an hour.
When, however, an obstruction of the
sun's, rays was removed, Da Vy
served the diamond to burn. It glowed
brilliantly with ; a- scarlet â¢ light, lnclin-;
Ing to purple, and^when placed in the
dark. continued .-'to burn for four,min
utes. . The ; flame having been .ex
tinguished, the experiment/ was twice
repeated, at the end of which the dia
mond, was /entirely consumed, and so
we had the. knowledge, obtained at
price,, that the gem Is pure carbon."
An unfortunate man so evilly conditioned as to be an
inmate of the Sacramento County Hospital was given
carbolic acid the other day instead of a dose of salts
and he promptly died. Can it be possible that the
health authorities of Sacramento are seeking to emulate
those of San Francisco in one of their recognized
specialties ?W| V Â¦,".,.Â¦

OF late some of the most influential: journals in
Great Britain have been undertaking an exposure
of the excesses to which the exercise of municipal
control of public utilities has been carried by some of the
cities of the kingdom. The excesses, it appears, are nu
merous and costly, so that "municipal trading," as the
British call it, is evidently becoming a very serious mat
ter to taxpayers.
A recent review, of some of the results of the move
ment toward municipal control says' the advocates of the
system wish the city government of London to enter
upon % the construction and operation of iooo miles of
municipal tramways. It then adds: "On some forty
miles, on one of the richest traffic routes in the world, the
Council lost Â£2250 last year. What a cheerful result
might we expect from t%e working of a thousand! No
business man would think of managing a thousand miles
of tramway by attending an occasional committee meet
ing. When Lord Claude Hamilton became chairman of
the Great Eastern Railway he found it necessary to resign
his political positfon, which was one of some eminence.
But gentlemen like Mr. Burns and Mr. Benn of the Lon
don County Council . would manage you a dozen railways
while punctually occupying their places in the House of
Commons and the Council chamber. We cannot get
away from our scientific theory - that radium is ;to be
found, not only in pitchblende, but also in the brains of
municipal representatives." . - Â¦] . / \ -
It is not worth while .trying to figure out what the
Londoners would lose on a thousand miles of railway
through the city generally if they i are now .losing over
$11,000 a year on a forty-mile system in one 'of the
richest traffic districts. The. significant/ point is that the
repeated failures of municipal control- do^not in the
slightest degree moderate the; zeal of the Socialists for
f u rther . experiments. ; . If the Â¦ theory of : our London ' con
temporary , be true, and radium exists in the brains â¢ of
municipal representatives, then the energy of that won
derful substance must be 'directed mainly to making
wheels revolve like buzz, saws.' â¢

Knew His Man.
Captain Drake, head of the ordnance
department at Mare Island, is a firm
friend of the man before the mast. This
has been proven more than once, with
the result that there Is hardly a day
passes that he is not compelled to listen
to the tale of woe of some old salt who
imagines that he has a grievance.
' It was only a few days ago that an
old sailor named Murphy, whose coat
sleeve was almost covered with service
stripes and who -has for several months
past been quartered on the receiving
ship Independence, found his way to
Captain Drake's office.
"Well, Murphy," said Captain Drake
after the old salt had doffed his cap
and saluted, "what can I do for you?"
Murphy grinned, saluted again, start
ed to say something, stammered and
commenced twisting "his cap around.
Drake got busy around his desk in or
der to give the old fellow a chance to
recover himself, and then after a short
silence up a sheet of official
paper and began writing. In the mean
time Murphy moved uneasily from one
foot to another, but uttered never, a
word. It was only when Captain Drake,
after writing rapidly for a few mo- ;
ments>had blotted and carefully folded
the sheet upon . which he had been
writing and handed it to the old tar
that the latter spoke. Then he simply
said, "Thanky, sir," placed the letter
in his cap, saluted and walked out.
As he left a guither came in. Drake
laughed and said, "Old Murphy has
been at sea so long that when, he gets
shore duty he gets 'homesick.' I just
gave, him a letter suggesting that he
be sent to sea again. The old rascal
knew I knew what he wanted when
he came in here. This makes about the
sixth letter like this I have written for
him."
Delayed Justice.
The sentencing of Charles Cackley tft
ten years' imprisonment by an Iowa
court thirty-six years after he had
murdered a constable, the prisoner hav
ing lived an upright, exemplary life
in the Interval, is a pathetic example
of inexorable justice, and reminds one
of the hapless fortunes of Jean Val
jean in Hugo's moving story. Cackley
had married and had reared a family,
who knew nothing of his crime and
of the indictment hanging over him.
His identity was discovered through
an application' for a pension, from
which circumstance it is assumed that
he had rendered patriotic service. He
is now an old man, and the court,
doubtless in recognition of his age, was
merciful and gave him a comparatively
light sentence. The law must be vin
dicated, no matter how strong may be
the appeal to one's sympathies; but.
many who read the narrative will re
gret that the prisoner did not remain
a fugitive from justice to the end of
his life. The incident shows, at any
rate, that there Is latent virtue some
times in persona guilty of grave crimes.
The better nature of the Iowa mur
derer seems to have asserted itself for
thirty-six years, but such a considera
tion could not, in the stern judgment
of the law, atone for the grave crime
committed in his early manhood.
WE believe it is the experience of our business
community that Chinese exclusion laws should
discriminate between the coolie laborer and the
Chinese merchant. This discrimination is provided in
our treaty with China which expires within a year.
The real strength of coolie exclusion is in the -opinions
of those who reasonably regard it as wise economics. Its
weakness is in the use of the issue fÂ«^r political purposes
by those who have a demagogue's fondness for appealing
to prejudice instead of reason. The former class know
how much our Chinese trade depends upon the Chinese
merchants. They supplement our white merchants and
do not compete with them. If we exclude Chinese mer
chants, then our trade with their country must depend
entirely upon sending and establishing American mer
chants there." But suppose China act upon her undoubted
reciprocal right to exclude American merchants? In such
case our trade falls at once.
It is necessary to put some attention into this view of
the case, inasmuch as Senator Patterson of Colorado,
with a zeal born entirely of political ambition, is striving
to include Chinese merchants in the provisions of the ex
clusion law. Such a policy does not affect his State, but
it does directly and vitally affect California. The first
section of the existing exclusion act has the clause: "So
far as the same are not inconsistent with treaty obliga
tions." The treaty obliges us to admit merchants upon
proper identification. Senator Patterson proposes to
strike that clause, out of the' act and if this is done mer
chants are excluded.
This coast faces China and looks to Eastern Asia for
trade just as the Atlantic seaboard looks to Europe.
Does any one imagine, that if Senator Patterson proposed
a policy as destructive of Atlantic coast trade the
commercial centers of the East would submit to such
tinkering? -If we submit to it here we must be content to
see Â«, Chinese- trade go to the Canadian Pacific 'Coast
points. The exclusion of coolies is~ in the interest of
American labor. Chinese commerce is in the interest of
American labor. To exclude the merchants on whom
that trade depends is to injure that commerce and there
fore to injure American lab<5r.
" It is easy for the zealot and the demagogue to go too
far and Senator Patterson is already over the line. A
study of the records of the custom-house' in this city will
convince any California working man, or business man,
of the relation of Chinese merchants to our commerce
with China. Every exchange made through their* agency
is in the interest of American labor, as is all commerce,
domestic and foreign. If we cut off that trade we obso
lete American labor and stop American wages to that ex
tent. All of our Asiatic shipping and commercial inter
ests should be watchful of the propositions of the Colo
rado Senator and of similar propositions by whomsoever
offered.
CHINESE EXCLUSION.
Arpeggio Study.
BY A NICE TERHUNE.
<Sor.R Writer.)
Copyright. 1HC4. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Before bringing to a close my series
tÂ»r music talks it would seem best to
pive a few practic^ supgestions in re
gard to advanced arpeggio study for
We have already dealt with the or
dinary method* of studying the arpeg
gio, but Ihere are other arpeggio forms
of much wider range which our pupil
will find of infinite value as time goes
en, and these it is my purpose to ex
plain to you to-day.
Let the jiupil start on C, two octaves
below the middle of the piano. Placing
the fifth finger of his left hand upon
this note he ascends by way of a
â¢â¢diminished" chordâ that is, he strikes
K flat, then G flat, A and then C again.
In this way he goes up the scale for
four octaves, using his first finger
(thumb) in place of the fifth on C
as he begins each group. The fourth
finger is to be used on E flat, the third
on G flat and the second on A. Thus
the scale runs C. E flat, G flat, A. C.
K flat. G flat, A. for four octaves. When
the C at the top of the fourth octave is
reached it is struck by the fifth finger
of the right hand instead of the thumb
of the left, as would naturally be sup
posed. The right hand in this, way
picks up the thread of motion and
travels down the piano over the same
rotes used by the left hand in ascend
ing. The fifth finger, as mentioned
above, starts on C, the fourth takes A,
the third G flat, the second E flat and
the first fingrer C each time until the
eiudent is finally carried back to the
point from which he started.
This arpeggio should be practiced
with the metronome, if possible, as it
is much easier to acquire a steady,
even swing and to increase. the tempo
in proper ratio if the metronome does
the counting, so to speak.
Every C should be strongly accented,
end the exercise should be played a
number of times in succession before
finally stopping on the lower C.
The fingers must be raised very high
end the notes struck with great firm
ness in the slower forms of the exer
cise, but as the pupil increases the
tempo he must play more lightly, em
phasizing only the accented notes,
vhkh are to be used as pivots on
which to swing the whole phrase.
After the pupil has played the ex
ercise four times, in a moderate
tempo, with the accent as described
above, he must stop for a moment on
C. relax, and then begin again. This
time the accent must come on the sec
ond note in the group. This arpeggio
form is excellent for study, as it brings
the accent on the fourth finger in each
hand.
The fourth finger is? always the
weakest in an arpeggio, and unless it
is under very good control will be
apt to slight the notes allotted to it
in a rapid arpeggio of ordinary form.
â¢The accenting process does away
v.ith any tendency to slight notes,
however, and the value of practicing
arpeggios in this way will at once be
seen.
Next, the accent must be moved up
one note, bringing it on G flat. Each
form must be practiced a certain num
ber of times, after which the pupil
must move the accent up one note.
He must continue doing this until he
finds himself where C becomes the
accented note once more.
"l^ he progresses he will find the
jna.trwÂ» of accenting a little compli
cated, but it will not trouble him if
he works it' out exactly according to
the rules I have laid down for the
first three forms. If he can realize
that the accent simply moves up the
jiiano. while the exercise is stationary,
and that though this brings apparently
a shortage of notes at the upper end
of the arpeggio, they all catch up at
the lower end, he will have no trouble.
The principle is really Just like that
of the old game "Going to Jerusalem,"
which every one has, I am sure, played
in his or her childhood. In this game,
it will be remembered, there is al
ways one chair less than the number
of people who play the game, and as
each time one chair is removed, thus
making it necessary for one person to
leave the ranks, those left out all con-
Krrgate at one side of the room. So
while the number marching around
the chairs becomes steadily smaller
the company of people standing at the
other side of the room becomes pro
portionately larger until finally all are
together again.
This is the best Imaginable simile for
the arpeggio form as I have Just griven
it to you, for as the notes at thÂ« top
grow fewer they seem to congregate
at the bottom, while the exercise, los
ing no rhythm by the changing of the
accent, goes on and on, being swung
back and forth on the eYer prominent
accent.
After the pupil has conquered all the
difficulties in this form of the arpeggio
he must take the next.
In this form the second finger
changes half a tone, making the notes
to be played C, E fiat, G flat. A flat
and C.
This is to be treated exactly as the
first exercise, with the accent creep
ing gradually upward as before.
After this comes another form. In
this the second finger goes back to Its
first position on A natural, and it is
the third finger that changes, lowering
touch their drum with indescribable
skill. They have innumerable turns
of the hand and tricks of style which
one cannot help but admire. That the
rhythm can very well depict of itself
many things is self-evident. The dif
ference between joy and sorrow, be
tween the jubilance of victory and the
depression of defeat is too obvious a
thing that few would fall to recognize
It. The drum Is not only an Instru
ment of music, but the great Instru
ment of joy and social intercourse
among uncivilized races, inasmuch as
it is the constant accompaniment of
the dance. We are not half such per
sistent dancers as our unsophisticated
brethren. "While we limit our revels
to the small hours of the night once
or twice a month, it may be, they are
always at it â at morning, at midnight,
in the afternoon or evening, it matters
not. Wherever a shady spot presents
itself or a frfendly company Is assem
bled this offers a fair opportunity for
a dance, and off they go dancing
where we should only indulge in a lit
tle conversation. To accompany the
dance, as we said, and to mark the
measure of the feet, the drum Is most
useful, and, indeed, indispensable.
With Its strong accented rhythm it
keeps all ihe dancers right and is as
exhilarating and Inspiring to them as
the strains of the violin and orchestra
to ourselves. '*â¢--

Their Little "Arcady.
'Way up on Telegraph Hill, just
where the beginnings of Chestnut
street waver along the verge of the
quarry, there is a little old cottage of
a weather beaten visage and cracked
roof which stands there poised in mid
air over the bay beneath, a mere phan
tom, shade of its * departed glory. In
that crazy old house there has lived
for the last thirty-five years a little
old Frenchman and his good woman.
They moved in there in the days when
some of the "nobs" of the city de
lighted to honor Telegraph Hill with
their presence, and now ,when all of
the old houses are becoming swarming
rookeries and the streets are the prov
ince of an army of tiny, sun-browned
Italians, old M. Cazat and neat little
Mme. Cazat a.rÂ» left stranded upon this
Inhospitable re^f like some gallant
ships of the "roaring forties," speared
through on a desolate rock.
. Behind the house there is a little
garden, all laid out in tiny walks
hedged with abalone shells. There,
with the hollies and the flaring nastur
tiums, the sweet mignonette and the
marigolds, is one so-lltary orange tree,
strange exile on this crag of bleak
winds and fogs. Beneath the strag
gling foliage M. Cazat has long ago
built him a little arbor, very small,
very cozy, just a little lattice work
with some Roman ivy trailing over It
in vagrant festoons and a rustic table
propped up on grapevine supports set
nicely in the middle of the bower.
Every afternoon in these long spring
days and in the later summer when
the wind does not bite and the fog
does not lift up its . gray arms from
the bay below, M. and M.me. Cazat be
take themselves to their little vine
cjad retreat, he with his Figaro or
Monde Illustre, she with her dainty em
broidery work or knitting, there Ux sit
the whole drowsy afternoon through,
as far away from the great roaring
world below and around them as ever
a Pyramis and Thisbe in old Arcady.
"Tout le monde may go on an' on la
bas," chirps M. Cazat with his quiet
smile as he waves his pipestem over
to where the murky cloud from the
city smudges the blue sky through the
interstices in the bower, "but Mme.
Cazat and I myself, we are not of it.
A rich man, a poor man down zare,

THE Sacramento Bee sounds the right note fonCali
fornia's future in exploiting the small farm idea for
the Sacramento Valley. In this connection the Bee
says that fruit planting. needs no further stimulus and
that settlers may profitably have their attention diverted
to variorum farming: . - ...;
We are of the opinion that the fruit planting develop
ment is to be in the foothills that border the valley. The
red soil of the foothills is pre-eminently the fruit soil. It
has a capacity for holding moisture that is not found in
the sedimentary soils of the valley. If kept weir filled,
so that the finely broken surface serves as a mulch, the
foothill soil is able to withstand any drought and pro
duce a crop without any or at most with a very, little irri
gation. The quality of the fruit is excellent. ' \*
Industries develop on the line of natural selection and
this is the reason that on both sides of the railroad, from
Roseville to Applegate and beyond, stretch a series of
fruit farms, small plantations, that make the most pleas
ing Scene to be found in the w$ld. Set among the
orchards of deciduous fruits and olives and small vine
3'ards are orange plantations, figs and houses surrounded
with palms and ornamental trees, that make a picture
that is hung upon no othe*r hills in the world.
But on the plains in the valley are the best conditions
for small farming, in which fruit may be an incident but
not the main object of farming. Alfalfa, root crops,
truck farming and berries, livestock of all kinds, poultry
and dairying offer there the best rewards that rural labor
can win. The sedimentary soil is alluvial and rich and
when the various means of irrigation are in use it offers
every facility the small farmer can 'desire. As for irri
gation it is by no means everywhere necessary to wait
for the accomplishment of great projects for the diver
sion of rivers or the storage and distribution of storm
waters. - Ground water is abundant and pump irrigation
is cheap and easily applied. The late Dr. Blowers of
Yolo County was one of the pioneers of this method of
irrigation, and by its use he first proved the possibility of
raisin production. That industry in the valley has lapsed
and been transferred to the irrigation and white ash lands
of Fresno and the Sacramento 1 Valley is being more and
more devoted to variorum farming.
The Bee is right in saying that our capacity for fruit
production abundantly advertises itself by its conquest of
the Eastern market, and that we should turn to the pro
saic but profitable bale of alfalfa hay as an advertisemeh't
of the capacity of the valley to support dairying, live
stock and general farming. Eastern farmers are trained
for these branches of the business. Fruit culture they
have to learn, and in the process they often encounter
discouraging failure. But they can apply to general
farming an experience already acquired.
The Eastern man who is well located on eighty acres
of land in the Sacramento Valley will astonish himself
by the results. He will find himself in the receipt of a
net income from that acreage greater than his toil could
wring from a half section in the East. His stock thrives
and comes earlier to market, because it is not retarded
in growth by a hard winter, and his work goes on
unvcxed by the hard weather which in the East makes
many months of eachtyear a mere struggle for existence.
Then he can here more easily change entirely or greatly
vary his industries. The transfer of the use of his land
from one crop to another is a matter of months only in
stead of years and he loses no time in the process.
A country and climate that permit intensive and great
ly varied farming are marked by nature for the home of
the small land holder. In that respect no part of the
United States can compete with California and no part
of California excels the Sacramento Valley. There a
farmer can have his house shaded by palms and sur
rounded by an orange grove that supplies his family. with
that wholesome fruit. His family garden and orchard
will produce something for his use every day in the year
and he may work easily, live well and secure a compe
tency sooner than anywhere else outside of California.
It is an encouraging sign that the press of the State
takes space from politics and controversy to devote it to
these economic matters. This is turning the attention of
the people from those things that divide to those that
unite them and the State already feels the benefit of this
new impulse. When Eastern men know our advantages
well and realize that here a farmer may pump water for
irrigation by.electricity, light buildings with it and use it
for power in many operations, this, added to our other
advantages, will increase the tide of desirable immigra
tion and the number of our prosperous and contented
citizens.
the tone to F, and making the notes
C, E flat, F, A, C.
When the pupil has familiarized him
self with this he must change the ex
ercise again, and this time the second
finger is to do the changing. This will
make the notes C. D (E double flat),
G flat, A and C. It will be seen that
in this way every finger in turn\has
the benefit of the accent, and also that
every Imaginable form of note group
ing that could be of use in arpeggios
is brought in. The fingers are strength
ened .and stretched at the same time
and are benefited in many ways be
sides the mere simple finger practice
that an ordinary study of arpeggios can
give. >
Next in order comes another arrange
ment of the exercise. In this the sec
ond finger raises the sound half a tone,
making the notes to be played C, E
flat, G flat, B flat and C.
This must be taken through all the
accents, after which comes the next
form, in which the third finger is raised
half a tone,' and the notes thus become
C. E flat. G, A and C.
. After this comes C, E natural. G flat,
A, C.
Then comes still another variety of
arpeggio, in which both the fourth and
third fingers are raised half a tone,
making- the notes C, E natural, G nat
ural. A and C.
Next comes C, D, F, A, C, which ar
rangement is Just the opposite of the
one before it, as it lowers the fourth
and third fingers half a tone.
After this comes two more forms, C,
E flat, G natural, B flat, C, and C, E
flat, F, A and C. These complete the
set of arpeggio exercises, and when the
pupil has mastered them all he will
have studied the arpeggio in practi
cally every conceivable form known in
music. These different forms are nat
urally not all intended for practice at
once. On the contrary, one form at
a time is quite engugh, and the pupil
should not go from one form to another
until he has perfected each little de
tail, step by step.
In the lesson to-day I have given
the student enough material to last him
a year if conscientiously practiced, and
if at the end of a year he has faith
fully studied his arpeggios along the
lines here laid out I am certain that he
will keen right on practicing them as
long as he has anything to do with the
piano.
These arpeggio forms are excellent
helps to keep one in good practice, for
they accomplish more things at once
than does almost any other branch of
piano work. For instance, there is the
finger practice. It must be Just as ac
curate in the arpeggios as in the scales,
and there is not the chance for slov
enly playing here that there is in scale
playing, for one is naturally more
exact and particular because of the in
tervals between the notes, which neces
sitate care and concentration on the
part of the performer if the tone of
each note is to be properly brought
out. Then there Is the strengthening
and stretching process already alluded
to, and the practice in rhythm, to say
nothing of the familiarity with the dif
ferent tone intervals that Is to be
gained in this waj. Last, but not
least, the alternating free motion of the
arms keeps the whole body in a state
of relaxation,* and the rests, first in one
hand and then the other, make it pos
sible to keep up these exercises for al
most any length of time without weari
ness.
In addition to this v the pupil's or
dinary scale playing jwlll be greatly
benefited by his arpeggio practice, for
after the different stretches between
the notes comprising the arpeggio
forms the ordinary scale will be found
to run most easily and naturally. The
student must, of course, understand
that each arpeggio form must be fol
lowed to its legitimate conclusion and
that in every case the accent must be
carried up the four octaves. On this
point I wish to make myself quite
plain, lest after having raised the ac
cent four times and being brought by
this means to the point where the be
ginning of the accent comes on the C
an octave above where he originally
started the pupil imagines that he has
finished that part of the exercise, or at
least has pursued the accent as far as
is necessary. On the contrary, his
work is at this point only one-quarter
done, and he must keep right on chang
ing his accent until he has elevated its
starting point sixteen times, thus ulti
mately bringing the beginning of the
accent four octaves higher than it
started, and, in other words, to the
top of the arpeggio.
If the student is very enterprising
and anxious to improve every oppor
tunity for advancement he may (after
he has conquered all the difficulties in
the arpeggios herein described and has
worked each form uplto a high rate
of speed, with the aid* of the metro
nome) invert the whole exercise and
begin all over again, working up grad
ually. By inverting I mean in this case
beginning on low C, as before, but
with the right hand this time instead
of the left- By this change the" right
hand plays all the ascending arpeggios
and the left hand the descending. It
is twice as difficult as the other exer
cise, but it is magnificent practice when
taken in conjunction with the first ex
ercise, for, as the student will readily
see, there is thus no point left uncov
ered. I have purposely left this great
arpeggio- exercise until to-day,, because
this is to be our last lesson, and I wish]
to leave the pupil with plenty of mate-'
rial to work on, so that his Interest and
enthusiasm may not cease with these
articles.
It seems to me v tbat I jcould write
forever on this limitless subject of mu
sic*study, but all things must come to
an end some time,' so I now take leave
of my pupil, with the earnest hope that
he will not let his progress stop here,
but will push on and some' time' do
great things in the musical world.
In closing. I wish to tender my grate
ful acknowledgment to the readers of
these lessons, who have become to, me
almost personal friends through the
many letters I have recelved'testlfying
to their interest and appreciation. *

finance and the expansion of our com

enforcement of these policies. The
Democratic party, the platform assert,
with imperialism and militarism as its

substitute for the basic principle of

resolutions say:
The tragedy that deprived the nation of

phasized, nevertheless, the truth that, though
men perish, the republic still lives. The work
of rehabilitation inaugurated and successfully

for President at the national convention to be
held In June.
GIST OF THE PLATFORM.
The President, the speaker declared,
had fulfilled his pledge to carry out the
policies of William McKinley, and the
crowning glory of the Roosevelt ad
ministration, he said, in conclusion,
will be the early beginning of the work
of the isthmian canal.
It Is said in some quarters that he made
a mistake in bringing suits under the Sher
man law. His party framed and enacted the
laws wnlch he found on the statute books.
It was his duty to enforce them. He has
dene so. fearlessly. The result has called .&
halt on unlawful enterprise. It has Improved
business tone. It has brought security to
legitimate enterprise. Now that the law Is
upheld our opponents clamor for the com
mer.centent of a general crusade for the ruin
of all corporations, good, bad and Indifferent.
The Republican party Is an enemy to un
lawful enterprises only. It will not com
mence an indiscriminate slaughter agalnat
those which promote prosperity and provide
wages to the workers by lawful methods. In
a word, the law will be impartially enforoed.
He found a department charged with fraud
In t-ome of its bureaus. He insisted on Im
mediate investigation. It was thorough and
complete. Corruption was unearthed in two
bureaus. The grafters were exposed, Indicted
and trials have followed and the courts will
punish the cuilty.
LAWS FEARLESSLY ENFORCED.
Hew marked a contrast to the course of
the leader of the Democracy In our own State.
He did not hesitate to pander to the lowest
instincts of paternalism and socialism and
write into the platform of. his party tha gov
ernment ownership of , mines. The people
asked for relief. Hill gave them a barren
and buncombe resolution. Roosevelt started
the machinery in motion that brought them
comfort and happiness.
"mistakes he has made." They say he forgot
the dignity of his position, the constitutional
limitations of his office, by Interfering in the
coal strike. Well, he did Interfere. He saw
the strike prolonged through the weary months,
he foresaw the dreary winter with the ap
proaching coal famine. The suffering and an
guish of bis own people became a real and
hcrrld picture and ha could wait no longer.
Ho did not forget that he was President.
This position magnified his responsibility, but
I'bcve all he remembered that he was a man.
He heard the â¢voice of humanity and undaur.t
ed by the risk of failure he threw bis bound
leys ecerey Into the work and won.
Democratic statesmen. In Washington am
burning the midnight oil, poring over the
columns of yellow Journals and the decisions
or our courts of appeals for a leader, while
now and then a good old Democrat, who al
ways believes himself of the Jeffersontan type,
is slncing "Four years more of Qrover," or
sighing for the late "Peerless leader." The
question with them Is not "Is ho fit. is he
capable, is he honest?" Oh, no. The burning
question Is of a financial character. Will the
sinews of war be forthcoming; can we fool
a majority of the people with him?
We have a candidate, strong, earnest, hon
est and brave. The enemy assail him for the
Coming: to the question, of Presi
dential candidates. Representative
Payne said: '

sufficient revenue for the prosperity of the
country and the welfare of the. ware-earner
ts secure we shall "continue to let well enough
alone."
The next time we tackle the tariff we
propose to Improve upon that. But so long
as the present law works well and. produces
Alluding- to the tariff, which the
speaker said the Democrts would want
to revise, he said:
The Democratic leaders are anxiously consid
ering what Issues they may get rid of and
how best to do It. When their platform Is
ftnal!y written ua it* chief plank win be de
nunciation of Re publican policies and defama
tion of the Republican candidates. The end
will be another overwhelming Republican vic
tory Â»n November. Â¦Â¦
Â«ho can write the platform or oar op
ponents? Who can nate the principles of the
Dtmociacy of law? Were they correctly set

The Republican psrty haa no apologies to
offer, no heresies to recant, no Kansas City. or
other eissracfcful party platform to retract
no offensive deceased Issues to be burled and

Representative Sereno E. Payne was
made permanent chairman. His speech
was received with great applause.
Payne said In part:
PAYXE IX THE CIL\IR.
The committee on resolutions met
Immediately after the recees was an
nounced and Chairman Burnett read
the draft of the platform. An attempt
was made to insert the resolution of
fered by Warner Miller, but Burnett
said there was a clause in the plat
form that touched on the subject.
He ha* probed deeply the great departments
of the Government and prosecuted and con
victed those of his own household of faith who
were found sulky. He enforced the law when
dire predictions of disaster were made and
by doing: to lest the favor Â«f some o'f the

but the Supreme Court has sustained his ac
tion and the market* have rebounded with the
phenomenal rise In the securities which dem
onstrated the Judgment of the Investors of
the country.
CHALLENGES THE DEMOCRATS.
Passing to the discussion of Presi
dential candidates, the Senator said
the campaign is to be conducted by
the opposition almost solely against
the tariff and President Roosevelt. We
accept the challenge upon the Dingley
bill and point to what it has accom
plished. He called attention to the
President's achievement* when Assist
ant Secretary of the Navy, which posi
tion he gave up to "take upon himself
the perils of a campaign in Cuba," and
concluded:
The speech of Representative Cockran In
the House laet Saturday was be
cause the President, following the ex
ample of President Cleveland, had. by execu
tive order. Died the limit of partial and total
disability for the veterans of the civil war
Mr. Cleveland and hi? Commissioner of Pen
sions had interpreted the pension act of 1690
to mean that it was within the power and
the duty of the executive to state the years
for partial and total disability when the vet
erans could receive a pension without exam
ination.
When the convention was called to
order, Senator Chauncey M. Depew was
introduced as temporary chairman.
Senator Depew, after sketching the
events which culminated In the revo
lution In Panama, eaid:
Â¦When Panama fulfilled the threat known to
all the world for months and successfully ac
complished her revolution the President acted
within his constitutional privilege with the di
rectness, courage and wisdom characteristic of
hiB whole public life.
SENATOR DEPEW SPEAKS.
Senator Platt Joined cordially in the
applause which followed the tribute to
Governor Odell, which was attended in
kind when immediately thereafter Sen
ator Platt was given recognition.
Delegates and delegates at large were
elected to Chicago.
As a prelude to his assuming the
chairmanship of the State committee,
Governor Odell was elected a member
of that body from the Twentieth Dis
trict.
Immediately after the adjournment
the Stale committee unanimously elect
ed Governor Odell chairman.
The platform strongly Indorsed the
administration of President Roosevelt
and the administration of Governor
Odell and the delegates at large to the
rational convention are "directed to
use all honorable means to secure the
nomination of Theodore Roosevelt."
There was some discussion over the
fact that "these directions" Included
only the delegates at large, but Gov
ernor Odell explained in this* way:
"Since 1SS0, when we abandoned the
plan of selecting the district delegates,
the State convention has not and, in
deed, cannot instruct the district dele
gates. These delegates are selected,
and if so desired by their home conven
tions are Instructed. This direction of
the convention to the delegates at
large to secure Mr. Roosevelt's nomin
ation is the strongest possible way in
which the matter could be put."
FASSETT DELEGATION SEATED.
The Congressional dispute in the
Thirty-third District between adherents
of J. Sloat Faesett and present Con
gressman Gillett was left practically
without settlement so far as the con
vention was concerned, except that the
M on gin -Fassett delegation in Seneca
was seated permanently and the con
troversy over the Congressional nom
ination will have to be decided by the
contestants themselves. Charles A.
Schiren of Brooklyn and George Urban
Jr. of Buffalo were named as electors
at large.

Why
Don't you. give your heart the same
chance you do the other organs?
Why? Because when any. other organ
is in trouble it refuses' to work, and you
hasten to repair it.
The heart, the ever faithful servant,
never refuses as long as it has power to
move, but continues to do the best it
can, getting weaker and weaker, until it
is past repair, and then stops. It is just
os sick as the other organs, but because
it will work you let It.
â¢ However, it's not too late for a "change
of heart," so remember
Dp. Miles' Heart Cure
Will give the heart strength and vitality
to overcome Dizziness, Palpitation, Short
Breath. Faint Spoils, Fains in Heart ana
Side, nnd all other Heart aches and dlffl-
cultiea.
"My heart would ache and palpitate
terribly, and at times I could hardly
breathe. Dr. Miles' Heart Cure has re-
stored me to perfect health, and I am
very grateful."â

afternoon and was observed by one of
the women- guests trying to open one
of the doors. She informed Mrs.
Knoblock, . the landlady, who at once
sent word to the North End police sta
tion, half a block away, and Police
man O'Sulllvan soon had Phillips un
der arrest. He was taken to the City
Prison and locked up in the "tanks."
When searched a bunch of keys was
found in his pockets. He said he was
looking' for- a woman he knew, but
had mistaken the house. The police
are investigating. v
Arrested on Suspicion.
Health Officer Ragan sent a com
munication to Sheriff Curtis yester
day asking that official to appeal to
the Board of Supervisors to remedy
the overcrowded condition of Broad
way Jail by providing additional quar
ters. Ragan calls attention to the fact
that inmates of the jail are confined
in cells in violation of the cubic air
law and that the resulting sanitary
conditions are- very bad.
District Health Officer Tillman has
filed a report in which he recommends
that steps be taken to correct the evil.
Ragan suggests to Sheriff Curtis that
the basement of the City Hall, which
was formerly used for prisoners, be
again fitted up to relieve the conges
tion'in the branch jail.

LOS ANGELES. April 12. â Keefe's
pitching was too much for the Cham
pions to-day and they were defeated
by Tacozna, score 4 to 1. Wheeler also
pitched a strong game, and had he
been given perfect eupport would have
held the Tacoma men down to one
run- There were three errors made in
the game, one by Graham of Tacoma,
which cost a run, one by Chase and
another by Bernard. Chase's mlsplay
was resDonsible for one run and Ber^
nard's for two runs. Pagan's drive
over centerfield fence was the only
earned run made. Score:

"His Royal Xibs" is a musical com
edy by Shafter Howard and W. H.
Clifford and its production will be on
a scale of magnificence and elaborate
ness that has seldom before been at
tempted in this city. The music is of
a high order, while the book and lyr
ics are topical and clever and abound
in satirical hits.
The cast and chorus number sev
enty people, with Miss j Helen | Heath,
the well known soprano, In the lead
ing -nle. One of the, most attractive
feati res in "His Royal Nibs" is the
numoer, "The Summer Girl," suns by
a double sextet gowned in the latest
fashion. The cowris ... were designed
especially for this production and the
millinery worn by the ladies forming
the sextet is very dainty and chic. -
An auction is to be held to-morrow
evening at the Alhambra Theater
commencing at 8:30 o'clock at which
the boxes for the forthcoming produc
tion of "His Royal Nibs" will be dis
posed of. Ex-Mayor James D. Phelan

The members of the California
Amateur Association met last nic'it to
discuss proposed plans regarding?
terms with the 3oxers* Union. "Rough

Charles Augustus appeared and de
manded purses ranging from $75 to
5125. The magnates refused to agree
to these term3 and stated they would
fight the union to the end. They all
agreed to aid the Lincoln Club in pre
paring its card for Friday nightT
C. C. Crowley, chief of the detec
tive service of the Southern Pacific
Company, accompanied by the oper
ators of his department and Detective
Thatcher of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s ex
press, returned last night from Red
ding, where they have been diligently
searching for the men who held up
the southbound Oregon express train
two weeks ago and dynamited the ex
press enr, after killing the messenger.
Although Crowley displayed reluc
tance In discussing the matter, it was
learned that he had abandoned the
search, - but not until after i every
thread of information that tended to
lead to the identity of the robbers had
been carefully followed up and proved
fruitless. It was admitted last night
by Crowley that he and his men had
traced footprints from the scene of
the robbery to the banks of the river,
where the trail was lost, and had sat
isfied themselves that these tracks
were those of the robbers. Thatcher
had gleaned sufficient information to
arouse _ his suspicion that a man
named Lewis, who is wanted for many
robberies, was implicated in the af
fair, and there is also reason, so he
believes, for suspecting that some of
the escapes from Folsom had some
thing to do with it. The search last
ed twelve days and clearly satisfied
the j detectives that the robbers were
clever fellows, who carefully planned
the job and shrewdly arranged in ad
vance for covering up their tracks.

The inning: started with Mohler at
the bat. His ribs came In violent con
tact with the sphere and he wobbled
down to first Smith connected safe
ly, as likewise <5id Frisk. Bending Moh
ler in. When Hall drove one through
the infield both Smith and Frisk trot
tefl to the plate. Brashear then hit
find Delehanty hit and Wilson hit and
Barber hit and Van Haltren hit and
I>osslbly they might have been hitting
yet had they not become fatigued by
running around the bases.
All the runs and hits happened Just
because the Oakland infield played in
close to catch a man as he dashed to
the plate. The Seattle Ftickers seem
f-d to become wise to this fact and
therefore they pegged the ball down
hard through the infield. The volley
of hits seemed everlasting- and Oak
land never rallied a bit after the fatal
Third round.
The baseball pme would have been
a sublime one for Oakland yesterday
had the third Inning been obliterated.
The third was not obliterated, though
the Oakland team was all but so when
the .round was over. Seattle whirred
seven over the path. The rest of the
came filfl not count- It was the third
lnsing. Score. 10 to S.
Such a walloping as the luckless
Mr. Buchanan was handed does not
occur on the EamÂ« diamond more than
once In a week. Nearly every run of
those sex-en that came In during the
third wa? aided and abetted by a solid
base hit. It was as pretty a piece of
plugging es any fan would want to
feast his eyes upon.
Many dogs of class will pass under

He will continue his work to-night and

have had their claims to distinction
passed upon.
The special prizes make up an un-Â«

petition for them will be keen in the
majority of the classes. The pavilion
will be open for the reception of dogs

The exact amount of the subscrip
tion list will be made public at the
cpen meeting Thursday. All persons
holding books have been requested to
report then and give the secretary a
list of the money pledged. In a rough
way the total is estimated at close to
$12,000, all of which has been raised
in two weeks.
President Simpson's committees have
been doing: yeoman service to date and
Treasurer Frank G. O'Kane announced
yesterday that more than J4000 had
already been deposited in bank as the
result of three men's canvass and that
sum did not begin to cover the amounts
pledged to these men, James Coffin, E.
H. Algeltinger and himself. A visit
was paid to the officials of the United
Railroads yesterday and, while no sum
was subscribed, a partial promise of a
liberal donation was made. President
Holland has said that no public pro
ject would suffer for want of substan
tial support from his company; that
San Francisco's jrrowth was identical
with the company's interests and his
words are not Idle ones.
What is wanted by the association
Is willing workers for the cause. Ath
letes have been slow in catching the
spirit. Yet these same athletes have
called loudly for just such a public
cinder path ar/i oval for years. The
lacrosse players have been apathetic
and there will be ho suitable spot for
them to hold their games in San Fran
cisco during the coming season unless
this field is an assured success. The
working member of the association
feel that co-operation from these
sources should be forthcoming. Money
is the essential thing in. the end, but
ideas are also sought and Thursday
night's meeting will be one of fre^
speech.
The Amateur Driving and Athletic
Association will hold a big open meet
ing in room 1000 of the Palace Hotel
to-morrow nisht and every amateur
sportsman who wishes to see. the pro
posed athletic field and speed track
in Golden Gate Park an unqualified
success is invited to be present. 'It
will not be a subscription-raising meet
ing and none need keep away for fear
of embarrassment on the score of
money. What is wanted is a litt!Â»
more general enthusiasm in the affair.
The work is going on. toward the end
of raising $25,000 with remarkable speed,
but too few men are doing all th>?
heavy work which is to benefit th'i
entire city and county of San Fran

McVey, who is to fignt Jack John
son, will commence training to-day at

If this edge of the continent was
tipped down a bit last night it was only
to be expected, as James J. Jeffries,
the champion of all champions; Jack
Johnson, the "colored heavy-weight
champion, and Sam McVey, 1 another
heavy-weight boxer, all hit this vicin
ity about the same time.
Champion Jeffries arrived In Oak
land from New York during the even
ing. He was accompanied by Billy
Delaney. Joe Kennedy and Kid Kagan.
The champion returned to California
to commence training for bis approach
ing battle with Munroe, which takes
place at Mechanic5* Pavilion on June
1. The big fellow was met at Sixteenth
street by a *Jeleg-ation of sporting men,
headed by Eugene Van Court and John
Marco vich. He svent at once to the
Gas Kitchen for dinner. Jeffries ap
pears in the best of health and seems
well pleased at the prospect of once
more donning the padded mits. When
asked about the approaching match he
said:
"As far as the match Is concerned I
don't know much about it, as I have
been on the road almost all the time
and have left all the arrangements to
Delaney. I am to meet Jack Munroe
before the Yosemite Club on the 1st of
June at the Mechanics' Pavilion, and
shall begin training in a few days.
"I expect to stay in Oakland until
the first of next week, and then I shall
go to my fcld quarters at Harbin
Spring?. I had a fine trip out and feel
first rate. "While I was on the road I
had a good time and made, a little
money, but I shall not be sorry to get
into training again. As far as the de
tails of the match are concerned you
will have to see Delaney."
"When Delaney was -asked about the
coming contest he. said:
"Jeffries will stay in Oakland for
about a week and will take a good
rest after the trip from Xew\York, and
then he will go to the old training
quarters at Harbin Springs. As the
Yosemite Club was unable to get a
permit for May the date had to be
changed from May CO, the original date.
The change makes practically no dif
ference in time and is perfectly satis
factory to us. Munroe told me before
we left the East that he would start
for the coast in a few days and we ex
pect heÂ» will arrive here in about a
week."

ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
The Bugaboo, which displayed such
marked gameness iii capturing the
third race, is another of the vast num
ber Qf winners bred at Napa Stock
Farm.*. Maurice Eppinger's colt is a
son of Crlchton.
Sam Hildreth once took Horton
from a selling race, but did not under
stand the - little horse's traits and re
turned him to the Bianchi fold.
Arisbe will meet The, Mist, George
P. McNear, Sea Air and Peggy O'Neil
in the two-year-old dash.
The card at Oakland this afternoon
is a strikingly good one, with the
handicap at one mile and fifty yards
as the feature event.
Trainer Alec Forbes sent Be.au Or
monde into Jake Holtman's hands in
the fifth after a long rest, and the son
of Ormonde brought home the money.
The chestnut horse did not have much
to beat and 7 to 10 looked a liberal
quotation. For a time the 60 to 1 out
sider Whoa Bill looked dangerous, pok
ing his head in front of the first choice
.for a way. When his bolt had been
shot Beau Ormonde downed him with
out effort by five lengths. Peter J, the
second choice, under a lukewarm ride,
ran third.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
With Jed Lewis on her back, Moco
rito was held a 3 to 5 favorite for the
mile and seventy-yard run and finished
unplaced. The old mare cut out the
runping to the stretch and then stop
ped to nothing. Possart, on which See
had been trailing along in fourth posi
tion, moved to the front, easily dispos
ing of the 100 to 1 shot Watkins Over
ton, piloted' by McBride. Merwan was
third.
Del Carina, from Bob Smith's sta
ble, took the two-year-old scramble,
starting a 'Z to 1 favorite. Larsen was
compelled to ride the filly hard from
the breakaway, finally passing Bill
Short and Saccharate, and winning at
the end with little to spare from Vel
na, an 8 to 1 chance. Sileo, backed
from 10 to 4, ran fourth, half a length
behind Bill Short.
Another big batch of platers was
unwrapped in the split of the seven
furlong selling affair. Montana Peer
ess went to the barrier a slight favor
ite over Toto Gratiot and was beaten
out by Sheehan on The Bugaboo. The
winner's odds were played down a cou
ple of points from 8, ana under a vig
orous ride he came from the far rear,
scoring by half a length. Polonius
at 15 to 1, ran into the show.
MOCORITO IS FAVORITE.
Large fields are getting to be the
rule, making it all the more difficult
to pick winners. Del Carina and Beau
Ormonde were the only two successful
favorites.
There were fifteen starters in the in
troductory seven-furlong event, with"
Tannhauser, Judge Voorhles, Varro
and Harka all highly touted as win
ners. The latter and Resigned closed
equal favorites in the betting.
Spry as a cricket at the post, Joe
Jones jumped away in front with the
20 to 1 shot, Lou Clieveden, and was
not headed, leading out â¢ Tannhauser by
four lengths. After a * tempestuous
trip Judge Voorhies finished third.
LARGE FIELDS TILE RULE.
The McCafferty-Blanchi selling race
feud continues to wax warm. On April
1 Horton captured a selling race and
was substantially boosted by Charley
McCafferty, owner of Flaneur, which
ran third. Oswald Bianchi of the firm
erf Bianchi & McGovern, or better
known perhaps as Daggle Smith, re
taliated by claiming Flaneur.
In the last race at Oakland yester
day Horton, with Jed Lewis up and
6 to 1 in the betting, skimmed through
on the rail, beating Last Knight, the
Lamasney entry, out a head. The lat
ter horse had been played down from
30 to 15. The winner was in to be
sold for $500 and was carried up to
$1500 by McCafferty, -at which figure
Bianchi ceased bidding. '
Then a dispute arose over the deliv
ery of the horse to his new owner. The
secretary's office was closed and, not
withstanding that McCafferty was
given an order for Horton from Clerk
of the Scales Egbert, Bianchi refused
to accept a check in payment for his
horse, and it is said Horton retired in
his old stall last evening. There is a
probability, that the two owners will
make some sort of a "dicker" to-day
and declare off the war.

prise by showing that as most of
j South 'America was east of New Tork,
the west end of the Panama canal
â¢will, by great circle sailing, be nearer
to San Francisco than it will be to

It was suggested by Mr. Emery that
a special car be chartered to take the
State Board of Trade party to Modesto
to attend the coming irrigation jubilee

! committee was appointed to attend to
S the matter.
Director S. F. Booth and Secretary
Fletcher reported concerning the ex
cursion of business men to the St.
Louis Exposition the State Board of
Trade has planned. The special train
carrying the representative business
j men will leave this city on May 13.
j Mr. Booth reported that he would do
j everything in his power and that he
was working for the success of the
excursion. Secretary Fletcher said it
might be necessary to run the special
train out in two sections. The sub
ject of the excursion was compara-
{ tively new, but assurances were com
ing in and also applications for accom-
I modations on the special. He judged
i that the excursion would prove to be
of benefit to the State. The board
voted to have Mr. Fletcher go to St.
Louis on the special train to person
ally conduct the party.
A happening of the monthly meet
ing was the introduction of the new
members of the board Â¦_ of directors,
William Haas, S. F. Booth and Harry
D. Loveland. Each new director spoke
briefly, assuring the board of appre
ciation of the Rvalue of . the work the
board has carried on and promising*
full and hearty co-operation in all
ways possible.

"Whatever might' have been the
rights of the petitioners, therefore, if
their licenses had been revoked, I am
of the opinion that a mere regulation
of the exercise of the privilege grant
ed will not confer a rignt to the re
turn of the moneys paid. As the
Board of Supervisors cannot legally
allow an illegal demand it is without
legal power to refund the .amounts
claimed, and you are so advised."
"It is not nepess.iry to the decision of
this matter that we should pass upon
the question whether, in the event of
the revocation of a license without
cause and before the expiration of the
term for which it is granted, there is
any legal obligation on the part of
the city to refund a proportionate
amount of the tax, since' it does not
appear in this case that the license
has been revoked. On the contrary,
it does appear that there was nothing
done by the municipality or any of its
officers limiting the use and operation
of the machines in any part of the
city and county other than on such
premises as were used for the sale of
liquor. And even in such places the
machine eould be used and operated
provided liquors were not sold.

The immigrant officials say that th<i
cases referred to are those of twelve
Chinese who arrived on the steamship
Doric on February 25, of this year.
Eleven came in the steerage and were
entered on the ship's manifest as "of
ficial servants for the Chinese section
at the Louisiana Purchase Exposi
tion." They had the appearance of
coolies and traveled, ate. slept and
dressed as such. Rule 44 of the regu
lations of the department adopted July
27, 1903, reauires all Chinese persons,
excepting Chinese diplomathc officers or
their attendants, to present ascertain
prescribed certificate from the Chinese
Government. ' None of the eleven steer
age passengers exhibited such certi
ficates, but they had letters and other
documents which the Immigrant offi
cials are not allowed to recognize. A
leport was telegraphed to Washing
ton, D. C, and pending the arrival of
the reply the servants and the cabin
rassenger were kept on board the
steamship for four days, at the end of
which time they were, with one ex
ception, permitted to land and resume
their journey. The exception was Chin
Ah Sheng, -who was denied a landing
because he was afflicted with a loath
some contagious disease.
The cabin passenger, in conformity
with the regulations, was required to
give a bond in the small sum of $500
as security for his going back to China
after the" close of the exposition.
Officials of the United States Immi
grant Bureau at this port were amused
yesterday on reading a newspaper dis
patch announcing that the Chinese
Minister at Washington, D. C, had
filed with the State Department a pro
test against the treatment of certain
Chinese who had landed here on the
way to the exposition at St. Louis.
The dispatch represents Chang Yon
Torig, secretary of the Chinese World's
Fair Commission, as saying:
My countrymen were subjected to humiliat
ing treatment at . San Francisco," where they
were held up by the customs officials for two
days, despite the fact that they had sufficient
money with them to Justify the statements
that they were reputable citizens of China
and not paupers.
They also had signed letter* from the Amer
ican Consul at Pekinc stating their financial
and social standing In China, but they were
forced to furnish a bond In the sum of $Â«>0O
gold each before the customs officials would
release them. â¢ ;

Colonel Irish suggested that the
Board of Trade ought to have bound
copies of all the annual reports of the
organization at Washington for ref
erence, with the Department of Com
merce and with the Department of
Agriculture. To instance the need of
this he said he had found that the
board at Washington having under
consideration the selection of a Cali
fornia site for the national experimental
farm was laboring under the belief
that the necessary climate could only
be obtained in Southern California.
He had reports of the California State
Board of Trade and these had sfiown
the Washington board that the Sac
ramento Valley was the place for the
farm. This incident illustrated the use
that could be made of the statements
contained in the annual reports of the
State Board of Trade if they were al
ways available at Washington.

substation committe.
On instruction camp â N. P. Chip
man, W. H. Mills, H. D. Loveland,
John P. Irish, Edwin Stearns, George
C. Perkins.
Manager A. R. Briggs said that If a
proper effort were made it would be
possible to have the canal commission
substation here and that the canal
commission would pass a part of the
year here* on account of the climate at
the isthmus during certain seasons. A
substation at San Francisco for the ca
nal would prove of great importance.
W. H. Mills said that it -would be well
to have the co-operation of all /the
commercial bodies of San Francisco.
Upon motion by Colonel Irish it was
voted that the committee to be ap
pointed on canal should be instructed
to seek co-operation on the part of or
ganizations in San Francisco. On sug
gestion by Mr. Briggs it was decided
that President X- P- Chipman of the
State Board of Trade should be ex
officio chairman of the committee on
instruction camp and* also on the canal
substation matter. These two commit
tees, as made up. Include the following
named :
Colonel Irish called attention to the
importance of having a substation for
the Panama canal at San Francisco.
Through such a substation, he said, a
large amount of business would come
to San Francisco. If the cement and
lumber men of California were alive,
for instance, there would be an expend
iture of $60,000,000 to $70,000,000 for Cali
fornia materials to be used in the con
struction of the canal. This was based
upon the supposition that the United
States customs tariff will protect the
canal strip.
Colonel Irish said that when he was
recently in Washington h^ found that
the different' California 'parties inter
ested in securing the camp for their
respective localities were wrangling.
He appeared before the Military Com
mittee of the House as a representa
tive of the California State Board of
Trade. Captain Hull of the committee
said that the Californians that had ap
peared had made enough damaging al
legations concerning the climate in lo
calities other than their own to destroy
the climatic reputation of the whole
State of California. Another commis
sion will be appointed to consider the
selection of a camp of instruction, if
the camp is near San Francisco it will
insure the continuance of the transport
service between San Francisco and the
Philippine Islands.
CAXAL. SUBSTATION.
Situated in this vicinity. Mr. Mills re
marked, the institution would better
distribute its benefits throughout Cali
fornia than if located anywhere else. It
ought to be in some county near the
bay.
The camp will have from 3000 to 7000
in it for instruction a great deal of the
time. There would be demands for
supplies, forage and other things that
could be* most 'conveniently furnished
from this center. He moved the ap
pointment of a committee to act. This
motion was seconded by Colonel John
P. Irish and was unanimously adopted.
Several important matters were
brought before the California State
Board of Trade yesterday at a monthly
meeting. VÂ»'. H. Mills said that every
thing possible ought to be done to have
the Government select a site for the
proposed instruction camp for the
United States army near San Fran
cisco.
Bulwer alleged in his bill of equity
filed August 1, 1902, that in the early
part of 1901 he was the owner of 5000
shares of the stock of the Yukon Crude
Oil Company and 20,000 shares of Rex
Crude Oil Company. These companies
were consolidated into a corporation,
known as the Union Consolidated
Crude'Oil Company, and- it was alleged
that by reason of such consolidation
the shares of the Yukon Crude Oil
Company were increased In number 50
per cent and those of the Ameridan
Fuel Oil Company 20 per cent. Bul
wer received 47,500 shares in the Con
solidated Oil Companies of California
in exchange for his holdings in the
original companies. It was alleged that
three directors of the Union Consolid
ated Crude Oil Company and its secre
tary, without consent of the stockhold
ers, "by some illegal and fraudulent
means"- transferred to the Consolidat
ed Oil Companies of California all the
franchises and property of the other
companies.
Owing to the"death of Hen?y F. Bul
wer at Boulogne, France, the suit in
Â¦which he was plaintiff and the Yukon
Crude Oil Company, C. S. Benedict, F.
W. Sumner, H. A. Jones, Henry J.
Crocker, Easton, Eldridge & Co., Wen
dell and George Easton and others
were defendants was dismissed yester
day in the United States Circuit Court
on stipulation. An affidavit by J. C.
McGarvin, Public Administrator of Los
Angeles County, recited that the com
plainant died on April 19, 1903, and that
it was deemed for. the best interests of
all parties that the suit should be dis
missed. It was agreed that without
Bulwer's evidence the suit could not be
won.

PACIFIC MAIL STEAJISIIIP CO
LON. WHICH STRUCK A REEF
OFF PUNTA REMEDIOS.
The steamer F. A. Kilburn, built by the
Fulton Iron Works for the WatAnvllle Trans
portation Company, was grlven her trial trip
yesterday afternoon and proveu.ln every way a
success. The Kilburn was "milk to carry
freight from Pajaro Valley to San Franclsce,
in competition with the, railroad company. The
Kilburn is a 14-knot boat and wilU make the
round trip in one day. Â¦Â¦ She is 175 'feet. long.
30 feet beam, 12 feet deep. She has two cargo
holds and carries her machinery amidships.
She has accommodations for thirty-four'first
class passengers. . t
Captain William A. Irvine, command
er of the Colon, has been in the Pa
cific Mall Company's service for a quar
ter century and bears the reputation of
being a thorough seaman and'careful
navigator. His career has been remark
ably clear of accidents, and in his pres
ent trouble he has the sympathy of a
wide circle of good friends.
The Colon has plowed the seas and
avoided rocks for more than a score
and a half of years. ,She was built in
1873 at Chester, "Pa.
F. A. Kilburn a Success.
Point Remedios reef, where the Coign
struck, extends out about eighteen
miles from the point and is one of the
worst menaces to navigjrtion on
the San Francisco-Panama route.' The
Pacific Mail steamers Nicaragua and
San Bias both got into difficulties on
this reef, which also spitted the Kos
mos liner Kambyses.
The Colon left here March 26 with
many passengers and a full cargo.
Many of the former were booked for
Central American ports north of Aca
jutla f and reached their destinations
in safety. The cabin passengers on
board when the vessel struck included
the following named:
Miss C. N., Powell, Miss H. Olafson,
O. A. Rowan, W. S. Vincent, Miss P.
Schmid, Lieutenant E. W. Wood, U. S.
N.; M. T. C. de Chasse, Rev. and Mrs.
J. H. Painter and Rev. and Mrs. S. V.
Dille. : .
In addition to these there were a
number of Chinese and twenty-seven
steerage passengers bound for New
York. ;
. â ; â .
The Pacific Mail Company's steam
8hip Colon, Captain William A. Irvine,
which left here March 26 for Panama,
struck on a rock Monday afternoon at
Punta Remedios. She was badly dam
aged, an<J when backed from the reef
was found to be leaking at an alarm
ing rate. The Colon is unprovided with
water-tight bulkheads. There is no
place in the vicinity of rocky Remedios
where a vessel could be beached, so
Captain Irvine put back to Acajutla,
which port he had left but a short
while before. By making vigorous use
of the pumps the run to Acajuila was
made. There the Colon was bea"ched. .
The passengers were landed and the
cargo is being lightered ashore. The
extent of the damage cannot be deter
mined'until a more complete examina
tion is made. \
Panama Liner Strikes a Reef Off Punta Remedios and Is Saved
From Foundering by being Beachedâ Passengers Are Taken
Safely to Land and Cargo Is Being Transferred to Lighters

Xezc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 12.â To-day's Â«ock
i market waÂ» F;ill lacking In the animation"
I Â»!.nh had characterized trading previous to
I thi<= week Â«nd the sagging tendency of prices
berame rather more uronounced than yester-
I daj-. There was not the .-sine effort to lilt ;
j pi ice* ty the t-ttmuiating effect of marking up
â¢ etÂ«clal stocks. -The market was not left Co
drltt as a dcrtlict. however, and a sort of
rurf-ing proems!" was adopted. It Is the prev
ail nt conviction in Wall street that the rectit
campaign for higher prices has enjoyed the
i'v: :â¢Â¦Â«Â¦- of some lnSuential capitalists who
believed that outride interest In speculation
could be cv/akent-d in that way. The course
j of to-<!ay> market was evidently Influenced
{ by the Government report on the condition of
j v. iiner wheat. The free offerings in the wheat
I miiiket served to modify the bad Impression
Â¦ of ihe rei>ort. but there was a belief that
j wheat moved under the influence of realizing
on speculation based on the conditions re
vealed by the report. The hope was expressed
also that the crcp had benefited since the
i fir?t of April. The" Weather Bureau's weekly
I fi'mnwrj' shook this hope to pome extent
! ov.ir.er to it* report of damage to winter wheat
! by heavy rains in parts of the belt as against
! the benefit In other i^arts where moisture was
need.-d. The imputations through newspaper
interviews as to the motives of the Northern
Securities suit by the principal parties gave
material for puzzled discussion. There was a
j disposition to eevk some indication of policy
I i the public attitude thus assumed which
i m.glit tfford Fome clew to the mystery of
1 thf- late absorption of Union Pacific. The re
port that the United States Steel Corporation
hail oGrlceifd an option for the purchase of
1 tons of Bessemer plrlron possibly
j helr-exJ to depress the preferred stock. The con
centrated absorption of the Â«?cond mortgage
bond* was the teature cf the early market, in
which seme J2.Â«K),000 or upward of these
bonds were taken by one firm. The impression
nas conveyed tbat much of this was on orders
for German account. London was a free seller
itÂ« -'.he balantv of stocks in this market, not-
JKttfestUdtaS the generally buoyant tone or
j ihe Lordon market. The failure of the ad
' va'ioe in Unlcn Pacific cf a point to lift the
! murket wa? followed by a steady decline In
the. whole market. Unlcn Pacific slumried at
the !asi on the hasty reading of the. bulletin
on the Attorney General's attitude toward the
intervention suit at St. Paul. The closing vac

"Prunes continue to hold the same tone. The
reports from England show considerable fruit
in bonded warehouses there, and there is also
a rood supply on the coast. Estimates differ
as to the amount of Prunes In the latter place,
the figures varying from 800 to 1000 cars. Deal
ers are awaiting the outcome of the annual
meeting of the California Raisin Growers' As

CHICAGO, April 12.â A large Increase In
the world's available stocks of wheat, to-
Cther with a sharp decline in corn, caused
weakness in wheat to-day. The close was at
the bottom. July wheat was down l%@lÂ«.Jc.
Corn shows a loss of IVic. Oats are off %@
%c and provisions 2 He higher to 10c lower.
A* fair degree of strength was evident in
wheat at tbe opening, the influence being the
bullish character of the Government crop re
port and advices of delayed seeding opera
tions Northwest. Initial quotations on July
were unchanged to %c higher at 87c to &~%c.
It did not take long to minimize the effect
of the low condition of the winter wheat as
rhown by the official figures when condition*
prevailing since April Â¦ 1 were taken into con
sideration. In tbe opinion , of many traders
sufficient rain had fallen during the first
week In April to overcome many of the de
ficiencies shown in the Government report.
AS a result of these opinions there was a
tendency to soil. Bearish sentiment was ac
centuated by tJ.e downward course of prices
In the corn i>lt. As the session advanced the
wheat market became extremely weak. Â¦ Re
l<orts Trom the Northwest stated that the cash
situation there was in a very demoralized
condition. Additional force to the report* was
Civen by heavy selling orders credited to
houses with Northwest connections. An in
crease of nearly two million bushels in the
world's visible supply also had a depressing
effect on the market. Under general selling
July declined to. S0%@8o%c and the - market
closed with prices at the low point. May
sold between 92Â«$c and 04 iÂ£c and . closed at
D2%c-
Heavy liquidation of the July options and
a sharp break in prices were the features of
tradlns in corn. July corn closed at 49%c â
lÂ»4c lower. May cloeed at 52c,- after selling
between 51Hc and 53%c. Â¦-*;. .
Oats exhibited pronounced weakness. The
market closed weak, -with July . at 36%@37c
and May at 37Â©3T^c.
Provisions were tlrm early, due to a small
run of hogs and flrm prices at the yards.
The close was weak, with July down 10c:
lard 2V4c higher and ribs 2Â»4c lower.

ceived from Los Ansreles. A few drawers of
Longworths were sold at $1 25, but most of
the offerings were of poor quality, being sun
burnt, and sold nlowly at 75cfifl. The Los
Angeles berries brought 15$i2Oc per small

In from San Leandro and met with prompt sale
at $2 50.
Despite t*e cooler weather the local demand
for Oranges continued brisk and there was a
good demand for shipment to Honolulu on the
steamer Ventura, out to-morrow. Good Lem

David Young of Newark. N. J.. rep
resentative of Brown Bros, of New
York, who financiered the United Rail
roads In its purchase of the local street
railway interests, arrived from the East
yesterday and Is at the Palace Hotel.
The preserfce of Mr. Young in San
Francisco fit this particular time is
regarded as significant, in view of the
threatened strike of the carmen. In
his official capacity he is the adviser
of the New York.banking firm in all
matters pertaining to the physical con
dition of the various interests which
they control or in which they
have important holdings. Dur
ing the last trouble between
the United Railroads and its men Mr.
Young was a visitor in San Francisco
and participated in the conferences of
the management of the big corporation
following each day's meeting between
its representatives and those from the
Carmen's Union. It is understood
among the employes in the offices of
the railway company that Young's sud
den arrival is in connection with the
new troubles, and this theory is borne
but by the fact that he was in con
ference with General Manager Chap
man and the latter's assistant for more
than an hour after his arrival in the
city yesterday. Concerning the trou
bles between the company and its men
he had little to say, except that he
hoped they would be amicably settled.
He also remarked that he was sur
prised that the men had made a move
In the "direction of trouble before the
expiration of the present agreement.
The representatives of the Carmen's
Union and the manager of the United
Railroads did not meet yesterday, and
neither side would make any state
ment, except that there had been no
developments. The conference . will be
resumed to-day.
From good sources - it ; was learned
yesterday afternoon that the manage
ment of the Union-street road has be
come satisfied that its men are pre
pared to strike if the men employed
by the United Railroads decide to go
out, and in anticipation of this move
the company has followed the example
of the United Railroads in laying in
provisions and other stores (it its car
barns, which would suggest that the
company will oppose the demands of
its employes.

Though' William tried twice., to, fire

time, he says, that he does' not know
just what took place. He merely, re
members having seen his; brother rush
in the room and having heard him ac
cuse-the family of stealing his money.
Frank. Casement was employed as a
shoe cutter by the firm of Buckingham

Detective Harry Reynolds .was de
tailed on the case last night and ob
tained.statements from all of .the par
ties concerned. All were reluctant in
After his arrival at the hospital the
wounded man made the following state
ment to Assistant District Attorney
Louis Ward: H'-'^fr
i My name Js Frank Casement, . This after
noon, about 6:30, In my kitchen at 1330
Valencia" street. BUI came In,- that is my
brother. He was excited. He had the -gun
in his hand. . I tried to. get It away from him.
I thought he was fooling. In th^e' mixup Â¦ the
gun went off. I was ehot once *ln the neck.
Then 1 said, "You have broken, you have shot
my arm."' 1. was bleeding and told him to get
something to strap around my neck. I Â¦ have
had no trouble with* my brother recently. This
shot was accidental. This Is- my brother Bill,
standing at the foot of the- bed. that , shot
me this evening. I feel all right. I- am sure
I will recover. K"i$
The shooting occurred in Frank
Casement's house on Valencia", street
a little after 7 o'clock, when the fam
ily were. at dinner.. The drunken man
rushed into the room and, brandishing
his pistol in the air, demanded that, the
entire^ family remain seated until he
had djscovered who it was that robbed
him of $20.
A few, days ago Frank Casement's
wjfe met her brother-in-law in a gro
cery on the corner of Twenty-fifth and
Capp streets. She jokingly asked him
for some money, and in reply he hand
ed her his purse. After a little jesting
the woman returned the purse, as she
says, without having \ opened ' it, and
left the store. > The. next- day she met
William, who was slightly intoxicated.
He accused her of having taken V $20
piece out of his purse. The ' woman
stoutly denied having taken the money
and felt hurt at the accusation. . v
Casement j next accused -his- wife of
having stolen the "money, and when she
denied her guilt he brooded and was
in bad temper until last evening, when
the trouble reached a climax that may
result In one death.
Officer H. N. Powell and Corporal
Shanahan, who were passing the house,
heard a shot and rushed to the scene
of action. They found Frank strug
gling with his brother in .an endeavor
to take the revolver away from him.
The blood that had steadily poured out
of the wound Just above the heart had
considerably weakened the victim, and
his, chances for living would have been
small had it not been for the timely
assistance of the officers.
The wounded man was Immediately
conveyed to St. Luke's Hospital, where
it was found that the ball hadVenteted
the left side of the chest below the col
lar bone and above " the heart. Dr.
Brady worked for nearly an hour In
an endeavor to locate the bullet, but
was unsuccessful. It is feared that the
wound will Drove fatal.
After a heated last night
William Casement, a newspaper, car
rier, shot his. brother Frank, who may
not recover. The assailant was drink
ing and femarting under. fancied, griev
ances, and the shooting took place in
the heat of passion.

and wines at their banquets, and while
the movement is growing a further
observance of the temperance move
ment in Secular circles was advocated.
The Rev. Frederick A. Doane ex
pressed entire opposition to the use of
a fermented wine in the administra
tion of the sacrament. The recom
mendation was accepted by the assem
bly.
GIVE UP USE OF LIQUOR.
During a discussion for an appropri
ation of $600 for the Hebrew Presby
terian mission it developed that the
Rev. Moses Bcrcowitz pays his rent,
printing and the living of himself and
wife and children out of the 5600 per
annum allowed him.
All the church appropriations were
allowed without curtailment.
Dr. Gilchrist has recently been oc
cupying the pulpit at Calvary Presby
terian Church, alternating with Pres
ident Macintosh, D. D., of San Fran
cisco Seminary, during the temporary
absence of Dr. Hemphill in Australia.
When the church appropriations
came up for consideration there were
matters which kept up the interest
for some hours. The dissolution of
Franklin-street Presbj-terian Church
was protested against by thirty-five of
the congregation and it was ultimately
resolved that Professor Gilchrist shall
take charge of the church for the next
six months.
The moderator suggested that the
autumn would be a grood season in
which to invite Dr. Stelzle. and lhÂ«
Rev. C. C. Herriott agreed that an ef
ficient worker such as the doctor
would stir this city to an interest in
the religious work.
The Rev. Mr. Bevier said that his
church work brought him much in
contact with the laboring man and in
speaking of the importance of the
proposed visit ot Dr. Stelzle said that
his experience had shown him that
labor unions were ready to be ap
proached, but that it should be ac
complished in a wise way.
The reverend gentleman remarked
that there were certain labor unions
with which one could not become af
filiated if he worked on a Sunday.
This he considered was a good be
ginning, .iyii
Ttoe greatest problem In the life of San
Francisco is the labor <juestion. and. as you
know, it has comt to a j>oint in this city not
rtachfd in any other city in the l'nit-_>d
Etctts. And thi* very Hrment is not being
reached by religion as represented by Protest
antism. Look to the south of Market street,
Tvhere there is work to bf done among this

OTHER ACCOUNTS SHORT.
The total appropriation of moneys received
from ihe m'.dKal department amounted to
$l'fi>41 12. Of thlF amount $'J7Â«rt :!Â«. In form

All of the savings bank deposit?, being

bef-n found to be intact.
The&e recei:itt included students' deposits,
fees and money received from other sources,
which had been paid Into the secretary's office
at B rk>l<> and later deposited with the
treasurer, but it appears that the late secre
tary never ke;t any record of this in perma
nent form, making his distributions when the
trensurer's account came in, cither from the
stu'os of receipts or loose memoranda or from
memory.
The eystem seems to have been that, when
the statement* rendered monthly by the treas
urer were received at the office, then, and not
till then, the receipts of mon^y during the
month were entered in the cash book.
At the beginning of thÂ» defalcation the sec
rctp.ry appears to have used the cash which
came In by the way of students' depoelu,'

ultimately depositing them with the treasurer
to make up the proper amount of students' de

them to the account to which they belonged
when he had come into posssssion of other
funds.
A. W. Foster. John A. Britton and I.
W. Heilman of the finance committee,
Board of Regents, University of Cali
fornia, submitted to the board at a reg
ular meeting yesterday an elaborate
report of the defalcation of the late
secretary. W. A. McKowen. Excerpts
from the report of the experts. Knight.
McLaren & Goodie, are embraced In
the document. The deficiency estab
lished beyond question amounts to
$51,478 76. The following statements
are contained In the report:
At the -session yesterday Guy C.
Earl presided. The roll call was re
sponded to by Regents Britton, Yorke,
Â¦Way-mire, Taussig, Foster, Dohrmann,
Rowell, Anderson. Reinstein, Ellinwood
and President Wheeler. No motion was
made to proceed with the election of
a secretary.- It was remarked that the
interest on the Flood endowment this
year would amount to $8000. The an
nual commencement at Berkeley is set
for May 18. At the May meeting of
the Regents the budget for the next
year will be considered.
The special committee on the status
of the medical department of the uni
versity presented an elaborate report.
The members of the committee are Dr.
Chester Rowell. J. B. Relns\ein, R. J.
Taussig and C. AV. Slack. T"he presi
dent of the university was invited by
the committee to present his views of
the subject under consideration and a
letter from the president is therefore
embodied in. the report.
DEPARTURE CONTEMPLATED.
The discussion on the report indi
cated that a new departure in this de
partment is contemplated. If the re
port is adopted the colleges in San
Francisco will hereafter be devoted to
chemical work. Instruction in the
scientific branches, such as chemistry
and bacteriology, will be given in
Berkeley. Hitherto the medical depart
ment has been conducted on its own
resources. Hereafter it will share with
other departments in the general ap
portionment of university money.
Regent Reinstein wanted the, report
referred to the finance committee with
favorable indorsement, but A. W. Fos
ter, chairman of the committee, vigor
ously opposed the suggestion. The
proposition was simply referred to the
finance committee with instructions to
report thereo-n when the budget was
submitted.

A paragraph in the report of the
finance committee recommending that
all endowments be pooled caused some
discussion. The recommendation was
adopted. The committee simply recom
mends the savings bank system of put
ting all the money to be loaned Ip one
fund and crediting to each endowment
its pro rata of the interest received.
The chairman of the committee, in re
sponse to inquiry, said a loan of $50,000
had been made to the Dominican friars
of Txjs, Angeles. The loan was made
on the recommendation of Mr. Hellman.
The land held as security is appraised
at $105,000. The rate of interest is 6
per cent. - - . . ,
The Regents resolved to appoint a
committee to confer with Wine Grow
ers Frank T. Swett. Charles Bundschu,
H. Weinstock, C L. Larue and John
Swett. The conference was invited by
the State Viticultural Club. It is rep
resented to the board that there are
10,000 wine growers in the State and
that they have JSQ.000.000 invested. In
ten years one disease destroyed prop-

The president announced that Pro

from the students' fees were covered up by reT
celpts from other sources, these belns made

moneys no estimate can be made. From the

In oil lands in Kern County.
According to the complaint the
plaintiffs purchased the land in 1900
upon Blood's representation that it
was % a valuable -piece of realty. The
consideration' was $11,000, and that
sum was paid to ; J. J. Mack. of Ba

of paying for it at a future date."
Last December a demand for -the

made upon. Blood, but he denied ever
