General Trepoff Issues Warning
That Troops Will Fire
Upon All Disturbers.
FRIGHTENED CZAR TURNS
TO DE WITTE FOR RESCUE
Cossacks Succeed in Maintain
ing Semblance of Order
in the Capital City
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 26.â St. Petersburg was in a panic to-day, but to a
large extent apparently without reaso/i. The most alarming rumors were in cir
culation and the shopkeepers on all except a few of the principal streets closed
their stores and boarded up the doors and windows, while peaceful-minded in
habitants kept within doors. Anxiety was evidenced In the whole atmosphere af
the city, but so far nothing has occurred to Justify these fears. There were no
disorders.
General Trepoff. who has been placed in command of the St. Petersburg
garrison and given an additional division of reinforcements, declares that he is
amply able to maintain order, and the* police are allowing the strikers to vent
their enthusiasm, so as to avoid a demonstration. General Trepoff instructed the
police not to interfere with the parades so long as they were orderly, but he gave
notice to-night that he was prepared to cope firmly with any disorder. He had
printed :n all the evening papers a notification thai the troops would to-mor
rov. he ordered to use cartridges In case there should be any outbreak.
By the jjieatest exertions the Government to-day succeeded In moving trains
xnanneJ by military operatives en a few railroads. Traffic Wai resumed irregu
larly o:i the Moscow and St. Petersburg Railroad and on lines from '. Moscow to â¢
H'Cist anu Kazan. The first- efforts were directed to the moving of cattle trains^
so us to meet the pinch of approaching famine in the two' capitals, andVbne
traiji \CiiQ cf cattle arrfved^at St". Petersburg and another at Moscow. A scant
eurply of milk, butter and eggs is arriving in St. Petersburg over the Finland
Hailroad, the employes of which refuse to strike.
The situation, however, cannot be regarded as much improved. The strikers
at their meetings to-day were as determined as ever to continue the strike, and
the full force cf the Government railroad battalions is almost helpless in the
face uf the general strike on the railroads. -The most encouraging feature of
the situation is the absence of any widespread disorder.
Students and Strikers Throw Up Barricades.
Picturesque details have been received of the rising at Kharkoff, where
students and strikers took possession cf the locality in the center of the city
containing the university, the cathedral and other buildings, threw up barri
cades, constructed a regular fortress and elected a provisional government, but
cool beads effected a rearrangement of matters.
The strike contagion is spreading. All classes of workmen are organizing
sympathetic strikes and industrial life in the country is coming to a standstill.
The situation cannot long continue. Either the workmen will' soon -be starved
into submission, or pillage, with military interference and bloodshed on a large
scale, is bound to follow.
At Moscow tiOO cabmen have already fought the strikers, whom they charge
â¢with taking bread out of their mouths. In many cities, especially lloscow, the
Question of food is becoming extremely serious. \u25a0
Collisions between troops and strikers have occurred at several places. At
Ekaterinoslav a pitched battle between soldiers and strikers was fought and the
city was left in darkness.
The ranks of the 40,000 workmen from the mills and factories who joined the
strikers yesterday were increased by 30,000 more this morning. All the employes
of the port, 4000 in number, walked out, and 12,000 other men fro: i the steel works
left, work in a body. The inhabitants of St. Petersburg awoke to find the capital
resembling a beleaguered city. The shops in the Vasiliostrov district and in all
the suburbs are closed, windows were boarded and barred, and mounted patrols
tv tx*Â© lo Dc te en c\ cry wflfeirÂ© in tnc strccls.
Supply of Bee/ Sufficient Jor Only Three Days.
The prices of food have gone up and the supply of beef is only sufficient for
three days, but there are ample supplies of wheat and rye for two months.
The Emperor and the Court at Peterhof are supplied by a warship - from St.
Petersburg. All the families who can afford it have hastened to lay In sup
plies to withstand a eiege. The suffering falls the heaviest on the poor, who
live from hand to mouth. All the bakers sold out their bread before noon.
The meat dealers have been ordered by the revolutionists not to deliver meat
to the troops, under pain of death, and consequently the eoldiem are living on
canned food. The butchers have notified their patrons that the meat "market
probably will be closed to-morrow, because of lack of meat. All the St. Pet
ersburg schools were closed to-day and the children were sent home with in
structions not to return until their parents think it safe to do so. . \
During the afternoon striking workmen began marching into the outlying
districts and inviting their comrades to join them. The police and troops did
not. interfere, but by General Trepoff's orders the spirit shops were closed.
Puring the day the pharmacists formally struck.
The police are becoming frightened, many of them offering' their resignations.
As a result of a series of special ministerial councils under the presidency of
Count de Witte, held to adopt measures to deal with the internai situation,
the new national assembly law and laws granting practical freedom of the
press and of speech were adopted and will be promulgated forthwith.
Upon the peremptory demand of Prince Khilkoff, the Minister of Railroads,
the budget covering the remuneration of railroad employes will be revised to
meet the promises made last spring. Unless this were done, the Prince an
nounced, Jat would resign.
De Witte Now Practically Dictator in Russia.
Count de Witte, even in advance of the promulgation of his formal appoint
ment <>$ Premier, completely dominates the situation.
Interesting details have been learned regarding Count de Witte's interview with
Emperor Nicholas last week, at which it was agreed that the time had come
to limit the autocratic power and give the people a real share in the govern
ment of the empire.
The Emperor asked Count de Witte to speak frankly and after listening ,to
the statesman's exposition of the situation he appeared to be utterly unnerved
by the deplorable state of affairs and cried out that he was weary of the strug
gle and felt like leaving all and fleeing to Darmstadt; hence, probably, the or
igin of the report tftat the Emperor was going abroad.
Count de Witte, however, told the Emperor that, in his opinion, not even a
republic could now save Russia from anarchy. It was the Emperor's duty to the
people and "the country to face the situation by meeting the crisis, namely, to
abrogate the autocratic power ajrfl grant a constitution by creating a .'ministry
responsible alike to the crown and the representatives of the nation. The Em
peror finally accepted, requesting Count de Witte to draft a project, which in
ckeleton form he approved last Sunday when the Count agreed to accept 'the
premiership on condition that he could name the ministers, -and that they
should report to bis Majesty only through himself as head of the Cabinet.

record of the Mortuary Clerk's ofica tor

Commissioner Bnodgrass tnat the fad tor
automobiling Is one of the most potent
modern causes of race suicide. Of eighty*
four still-born children in one month, th*
Health Commissioner declares, three un
doubtedly were due to mothers indulging
In auto ride*. Others are suspected of
having, been caused the same way. though
the proof Is not positive.
â¢ "The auto â¢Is a new factor In the race

to-night. "But the determination of tha

POLITICIANS BEFORE
SUPREME COURT.
Question of Ballot Forms Is Argued"
in Highest Legal Tribunal. j
RuePs "Independent" Side Shows Will.
Know Their Fate To-Day.
For two hours yesterday morning the
attorneys tor tlie Ruef faction and for
the fuFionists argued the question
whether the headings "Independent
Republican" and â¢"Independent Demo
crat :o" should be placed on the ballot
"to be used in the coming municipal
\u25a0 election. The case was before the Su
â¢prÂ«-me O^urt sitting in bank. At the
end of the discussion the highest ju
dicial body of the State took the mat
ter undor advisement, with the promise
to give a df-cision to-day. A quick de
cision is necessary because of the pro
vision in thÂ«> law which requires the
distribution of sample ballots at least
ten days before the date of election,
Â«nd those sample ballots must be out
on Saturday to meet the requirements
of the law. Kvery member of the
court was present except Justice Hen
eha-.v, and each listened to the argu
ments of counsel with greatest atten
tion.
The form of the question as to the
raising of the license on saloons of San
Francisco County was settled without
requiring a decision from the Supreme
Court. The question at issuÂ« was
whether "yes or no" was to appear on
tlie ballot or "for or against." J. E.
Wiilte. attorney for the petitioners,
\u25a0who claimed that the law required the
latter signification, was told by James
A. Devoid, member of the Board of
Election Commissioners, that the words
\u25a0for or against" had already been or
dered placed upcrti the ballots- Attorney
White accepted the change. This was a
victory for the advocates of higher li
cense for saloons.
IXI'BF "THIS MAX BEHIND/
For John 6. Partridge, fusion candi
date for Mayor, who petitioned the Su
preme Court to prohibit the use of tlie
names ""Independent Republican" and
/"Independent Democratic" on the muni
cipal ballot, appeared Attorney E. F.
Treadwell. O:i the opposite side were
Thomas V. Cator, M. J. Stein, A. S.
Xewburgh, who announced that he was
present to represent the Independent
Republicans: J. A. Devoto, Election
Commissioner, and A. W. -Voorsanger,
also a member of the administration
board. Behind this array of talent sat
Abraham Ruef. a silent spectator.
Ituef did not once change expression
daring the long arguments, but he
scanned tlie faces of the six Justices
continually, as if he hoped to see there
some sign of the final decision of the
court. But he apparently missed the
hoped-for signal and departed with
als cohorts, apparently very dubious as
to tlie outcome.
-I.XDEPKXDEXT" A. SUBTERFUGE.
Attorney TreadweJl. declared with
force that the attempt to use the
names. '"Independent Republican" and
"Independent Democratic," was merely
a subterfuge to catch votes for
me Sohmitz element. He said plain
ly that the "'lndependent Re
publican" and "Independent Demo
cratic' tickets represented no real
parties and no real principle, but that
\u25a0 it was merely an attempt by indivi
duals to distort the law arid use it to
deceive the voteK, He argued that such
cognomens would tend to confuse the
vater and might lead him to vote one
ticket when he thought that he was
really voting for other candidates on
the ballot. "What do these so-called
parties mean? What do they denote?
What principle "do'lhey stand for and
what policy will- they follow? If they
are bona flde in their pretenses as reg
ular parties why did they not select
some other name which does not so
closely resemble- those already placed
by law upon the ballot? Is it not rea-
to suppose that those men
who selected the names "Independent
Republican' and "Independent Demo
Â«ratk' did so with .the deliberate In
tention to catch unwary voter*, and for;
, no other purpose?"'

SThurloMi JJtocki
These were the questions which At
torney Treadwell asked the court and
the opposition and they seemed deeply
relevant to the case at hand.
COXFUSIKG TO VOTER.
His argument in short was that an
effort was being: made to place a ticket
upon the ballot which would confuse
the voter and that there were no such
parties legally as the "Independent Re
publican" and the "Independent Demo
cratic." because they had nev^r ap
peared before the people at an elec
tion and received the necessary 3 per
cent of the votes cast. Unless they
were regular parties t they had no right
to place upon the ballot the names of
candidates who were already upon reg
ularly formed tickets
On the other side Attorney Cator de
clared that the headings which John
S. Partridge was trying to keep off tho
ballot were adopted by regular parties
and that they should be legally allowed
a place upon the ballots. He claimed
that the word â¢â¢independent" wag not
at all misleading or confusing and
that it should be given a place upon
the ballot. He claimed that there was
a non-joiner of parties plaintiff in the
petition, inasmuch as Partridge should
have been Joined by the chairman of
the Democratic and Republican county
committees. He urged that the cases
which Attorney Treadwell introduced
as conclusive evidence on his side ap
plied to different circumstances, and
that according to law the names "In
dependent Republican" and "Independ
ent Democratic" should have a place
upon the ticket. Both attorneys agreed
as to the facts of the case.
The Kuef lawyers also stated that the
Election Commissioners were the last
resort in this case; that their action
was final, because at the time of the
filing of the petition to place these
headings upon the ballot no objection
was made. :
POIXTS MADE BY TREADWELL.
In part, Mr. Treadwell argued as
follows:
A point that I with to call attention to that
counsel has argued is that these petitioners do
form a ixirty; that the intre filing of a petition
signed by a certain number of people consti
tutes a political party, ,'lf a mushroom organi
zation like \u2666hat is a political party it certainly
iÂ» a new proposition to me. I cay that on the
contrary there Is nothing In the law that per
mits a party to be recognized as a political
party until it has stood the test of the votens
and polled a requisite three per cent of the
votes for their party, and is entitled to .a place
on the next ballot, and until it does that it is
an independent nomination in the exact words
which counsel himself read.
' The court will see that in every one of these
cares the names that have been selected are
names that have more force *nd more dlstlnct
ivenesr than the name Independent Republican
Party or Independent Democratic Party that
had been chosen by these petitioners. Could any
name be selected that would mean lees than
the word Independent Republican Party? What
did it mean? What principles does it show
that they htand for? Does it mean that thÂ«
men who signed that petition are Independent
in the Â£?ns*? that every man that is in the
regular ' Republican party la dependent? It
certainly does not mean that. Does It mean
that the party Is a party that is in favor of in
dependence '! Is there any party that is in
favor of Independence? Now what doe.s it
mean? I will tell your Honors what it meant.
The Uw had aJready given a definite meaning
to the word "independent." The law. In re
ferring to section 118S, Political Code, has al
rt-ady characterized persons nominated under
that section as Independent nominees. The
law that Axes the form of the ballot had pro
vided that they thould be called Independent
nominations, and that at the head of he col
umn, where those persons should appear in
the ballot It should be beaded "Independent
nominations." Now let us see what that
brings us to. Thty not only appropriated the
names of jwo political parties, but they also
appropriated and attached to themselves a
T^ord which is already on the ballot, and which
is v word which the law has given a dellnlte
mf-aning to. Now what is that meaning?
What do we understand by an independent
nomination? We do not mean by that that
he is a man that is any lean a slave than any
other man. but we mean that he is a man
not nominated by a regularly constituted politi
cal party, but that he is a man that goes tin
Jjy original petition.

UPRISING OF THE DECENT PEOPLE
FORESHADOWED BY FUSION LEADER
Significant Meetings Point to the Gang's Defeat
Crowds in Two Sections of City Hear Candidates Speak
The Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth dis
tricts redeemed their reputation last
night from the foul blot that has rested
upon' them since the'Ruef hoodlums and
thieves flung in the face of their resi
dents and the citizens of the entire city,
an insult that has burned in the hearts
of ' the "districts* vfiters since the " mem
orable, joint meeting of the districts over
a week ago at Garibaldi Hall.
. The. blue, and red buttons mingled in
the crowds that blocked, the entrances to
the crowded hall last night, and the men
wearing both : emblems saw to it that
toughs or thugs would not interfere with
the meeting and cast disgrace upon the
manhood of t the districts.
It needed but the words of Partridge,
strong, forceful, convincing, eloquent, to
draw his hearers to them, to keep them
quiet during .his address and to cheer
him throughout the evening.
Nobly did the residents of the districts
respond to the call of fair play and free
cpecch. What better sign can the decent
men of San Francisco require foreshadow
ing the clean sweeping of the grafters
from power than the magnificent demon
stration that occurred last night at Gari
baldi Hall? Not only the man but the
cause for which he stands evoked the
frenzy that caused the throngs of Its
supporters and admirers to march shoul
der to shoulder through the entire length
of the Forty-fourth District from Broad
way along Kearny to- the Call building
at Market street.
And it all is due to Ruef, In a way.
He had his thugs at th<3 meeting pre
pared to break up the assemblage, but
when they saw they were outnumbered
by the decent element they remained out-
Bide and their cries could be heard with
in the building during the entire evening.
At the conclusion of the meeting the
towdies lined the sidewalk prepared to
insult the Fusion leader. When their ac
tion was seen by the Partridge support
ers they also lined the sidewalk and a
human lane six deep extended from the
hall to Kearny street. When the stand
ard bearer of decency emerged from the
hall he was greeted with the hoots of
the Ruef men and the cheers of his sup
porters.
ROUGHS ARE \OISV.
Not satisfied w?lh this response to their
Intended insult the roughs crowded
around the candidate as he prepared to
board a car for home and prevented his
departure. Seeing this his friends gath
ered about him and the long march along
Kearny street began. .
As the dives and brothels of the Barr
bary Coast and Chinatown were passed
the throngs of Schmltz men far outnum
bered the Partridge adherents, but once
past the Hall of Justice the ranks of the
Fusion leader's force grew rapidly.
Men 'of all classes sprang from the
pavement to the roadway wheTe Part
ridge was being escorted and joined In
the cheering for the leader. Marching
shoulder to shoulder \u25a0 the entire width of.
the street rank after rank was formed.
MAYOR KEPT BUSY
IN HIS CAMPAIGN
Strenuousness of Schmitz Fight Is
Increasing Each Day -
Last night was a busy, one for Mayor
Schmitz and his fellow-candidates on
the Union Labjr party ticket. They
spoke at four large meetings south or
Market streef. and visited as many
more entertainments about town. It
was, not until' -at an early hour this
morning that they were a-blc to hjÂ«
their weary bones to bed\for a-littla
rest before the strenuous : work of to
day. It is true that the ieandldates on
the Union Labor party ticket are mak
ing a. strenuous tisht. It may be the
light *pf despair, although , they main
tain that ihey are working so hard
for the reason that they hope to elect
their ticket straight. Not only do they
speak at nights, but they, spend the en

city, meeting the voters: of every dis

Along the whole route the hoodlums of
from fifteen to twenty years of age kept
up a continual booing and cheering for
Schmltz, but the Partridge adherents far
outnumbered them. Seeing their yelling
was of no avail the youths sprang to the
head of the 2000 marching men as It
r.eared Market street.
As the Call building was reached the
immense throng crowded into the . en
trance and extended to the car tracks on
both sides of the building. Here the can
didate paused and attempted to address
the multitude, but the noise made by the
Ruefltes rendered him unheard. Seeing
that the riff- ran* were not disposed to

Dr. A. Glannini made an excellent and
efficient chairman of the evening. Prior
to introducing Mr. Partridge he made the
following speech in behalf of the resi
dents of the district: - Â£fy
Before presenting the fusion', leader to th!Â»
audience' I want to deliver to him a messa**
from the decent- people of this district. : A
message of apology for the discourteous treat

trict in which we have lived all our llveÂ»
other candidates begin to look a little
Jaded, as though the work was telling
on them. Each one of them speaks for

Good crowds greeted the Mayor last
night. He spoke along the lines which
he has followed all through thecam r
paign, pointing to* the present proper
lty of the city, the failure of the recent
Grand Jury to convict any one con
nected with his administration, and in
sisting that this, was a class light be

we appeal to the press of this city. lrrespectlv%
of their political feelings, to tell the city that
we are^ heartily so:ry that John S. Partridge
was insulted . by sneaking curs who' for tnt
most part came from without our borders.
In response to these manly words
Mr. Partridge , said: . .
There Is no need for apology from thÂ« citizen*
of the. Foity-fourth. An apology must come
from him who offends and I have never baei.
offended by the respectable people of this dis.
trlct. I know who it was that hurled tht
shameful insults at me. . It - was not ' the re
spectable, honest worklngmen, but hired thugs.
Mr. Partridge then quoted the consti
tution of the United States and the
State of California regarding free
speech. He reviewed the miserable
failures, of the present administration,
and especially promised the bonding
of a. new .City He reviewed
the various commissions and told what
he would do, when elected, in the way
of cleanfng them out and making them
honest and clqsed with a pledge to de
vote himself to jfhe securing of munic
ipal ownership. The last speaker was
Henry U. Brandenstein, whose fiery
words carried the audience by storm.
Even though the truths stung many of
those piesent he was cheered by the
crowd who perceived Intuitively that
he ppoke the truth. He confined his
talk principally to the discussion of
the many things that Ruef and Schmltz
have not done for labor. The other
speakers were. Dr. T. B. W. Leland,
John Connor and O. C. Pratt.
THIRTY-EIGHTH -'IN LINE.
Jleu Pack Jefferson Square Hall to Suf-
focation to Hear Partridge.
Before going to Garibaldi Hall, where one
of the triumphs of the campaign was await
ing him, John S. Partridge visited Jefferson
Square Hall In the Thirty-eighth District* where
a crowded house greeted him. The magnitude
and warmth of his reception Is doubly reas
suring to the fusion leader, as It evidences
the fact that all parts and classes of American
manhood is rallying to the support of decency
and to use the standard bearer's own words
"the 1 Ã¼bllc conscience is aroused."
The size of tha meeting may be shown from
the words of A. Van der Naillen, one of the
speakers, who said that when he appeared to
make some arrangements for final decorations
early In the evening he found the hall al
ready comfortably tilled. By S ' o'clock the
place was Jammed and In the hallways stand
ing room was at a premium. In proportion
to the â¢ numbers was tha enthusiasm of the
crowd and the warmth of the fusion candi
date's reception.
' The chairman of the evening was' A.. Van
der Naillen, who told of the conditions that
met his eyes south of Market street during
the campaign this year. Two years ago he
was a. campaign speaker in the labor districts
for Henry J. Crocker and spoke there forty r two
times. Many meetings at that time, he said,
were so poorly attended that, they had to be
declared cff. In contrast to that time he
spoke "of the crowded meetings that have been
held In thÂ« district- the Ruef men are claim
ing by large majorities. . -'
j When Mr. Partridge was presented he. spoke
of. the awakening of the public conscience. He
said that every citizen \u25a0 is awake to the re
sponsibility .of the government of San Fran
cisco resting on him . and promised to put on
his commissions when elected men who would
servo the people faithfully.
He went over Â«ach department from the
Board of Works to the Board of Health and
told of the graft and corruption existing in
them. ' He made an exception of the rank' and
file of'tfte Fire Department, trho are tend
ing to their business without a thought of
politics.
He characterized the Board of Health as a
crime and a disgrace and a stench In the
nostrils of decent people. He pleaded for a
new City -Hospital and said that the - Emer
gency Hospital system- was so bad that in
jured men would hardly permit themselves' to
be taken there. He closed with an appeal to
the voters to vote according to their - con
science and .with the belief that he would
give them what San Francisco needs." a square
deal all ; around, a clean city and a clean
administration. -
The other, speakers of the evening were:
Fred EggofV. Henry U- Brandenstein; Ik*
Goldman and Senator E. I. Wolfe. . \

FORECAST OF PARTRIDGE VICTORY
Estimates of Majority for Fusion
Nominee in the Districts.
JUDGE DIBBLE OUT FOR RUEF
Enthusiastic leaders in the battle to
oust the, boodlers from control of mu
nicipal affairs predict- an overwhelm
ing majority" of something like 15,000
for Partridge. The grafters, on the
other hand, are predicting that Ruefs
candidate for Mayor will win out by
15,000 majority. The betting at this
time is slightly in favor of Schmits.
but tho odds against Partridge are
steadily diminishing.
There are many signs indicative of
a great popular uprising in support of
the fusion nominees, but students of
the contest, who are endeavoring to get
a line on the probable" result, eliminate
the probability of an uprising, and fig
ure as to ithe' outcome on the basis of
the existing registration and the votÂ«
cast for Mayor two years ago. *
Sangruine supporters of Partridge
claim that the result will be something;
like this:
ilajorities for Partridge â Thirty
fourth Assembly District. 600; Thirty
fifth. 1000; Thirty-sixth, 300; Thirty

Judge Dibble Is back home amon?
his old congenial associates. He pre
sided at a Ruef-Schmitz meeting In the
Forty-first Assembly District a tew
nights ago. Early in the present cam
paign he made a speech at a Republi
can League meeting in the Forty-first
In which he expressed his joy In being
identified with a movement to better
the conditions of local government, and
Incidentally threw In the remark that
he had defended Maestrettl as a lawyer
only. â¢ â¢'â¢-"
The Judge's "identification with an
honest movement in politics occasioned
some surprise to himself and others,
but did not produce a lasting impres
sion. Later on his name was elimi
nated from the proposed list of dele
gates to the Republican convention be
cause the citizens of the district did
not like his record.
Nothing" more was heard of him In
the campaign until he bobbed up as
the presiding genius of a Ruef-Schmitz
rally. Many leading citizens of tho
district, wJio are actively engaged in
the cause of clean government and are
therefore working night and day to
promote the success of Partridge's
candidacy for Mayor, are extremely
anxious that The Call should give the
widest publicity to the announcement
that Judge Dibble is standing in -with
Ruef. ??.i~-7s -\u25a0 " \u25a0 ' â¢
The grafters have been brought to a
realization of the fact that they cannot
bluff, bulldoze or intimidate the fusion
nominees. T In every Assembly district of
San Francisco Partridge will speak his
sentiments. The record of boodle and
graft at the City Hall will be submitted
to the people. Last night Partridge ad
dressed a. vast audience of voters In the
north end of the city and was greeted
with cordial enthusiasm. He Is hourly
gaining strength. Rowdies and ruffians
in ' the service of the municipal adminis
tration cannot check his advancement.
The notion j that he will be t*he next
Mayor of San Francisco is entertained by
the closest students of the political sit
uation. The stortes, that Immense sums
of money are on deposit at '"this or that"
barroom for wager that Schmitz will be
elected are fakes. When the tales are
Investigated it is usually found that book-
makers have deposited small sums, to
keep the betting alive.'

Writes
CWhen a man like Carl
- Schurz, a man who for
fifty years has enjoyed the
confidence of the greatest
legislators of the world, a man
who never writes a word with-
out giving it due thought,
and who, though writing in
an acquired tongue, has made
himself a master of that
tongue â when such a man
presents the Reminiscences of
his long and useful life, that
work marks an epoch in his*
tory and an epoch in litera-
ture. When a magazine like
McClure's publishes these ,
Reminiscences it marks an
epoch in magazine-making,
even for McClure's.
These Schurz papers, which
begin in the November Mc-
Clure's, with the fascinating .
story of the boyhood of
Schurz, will take up before
long his point of view of such
men as Sherman, Grant, Lin-

RUSSIAN RAILWAYS.
Government Owns and Operate* Most
Of lilt- JJnex.
At the time of the breaking out of
thÂ« war with Japan the various rail
way systems of European Russia com
prised a. little more linni 31,0u0 miles
of road open for traffic and the Asliatlc
lines were 5153 miles.
Of the Kuropean iines the Govern
ment owned and operated 24.311 miles,
\u25a0while 10,873 miles were owned and
operated by public companies, and with
126k miles of short local lines, made
up the total.
The whole network consists of twenty
eight lines uninterruptedly connected
with each other and eleven isolated
lines, nineteen of the former (60 per
cent) operated by the Government and
nine (40 per cent) by public companies. ,
For many years the Government has :
operated its lines at a heavy loss, j
which, however, gradually decreased |
from 30,000,000 rubles deficit in ISS9
to 11,500.000 rubles in 1901. The cost of
construction of all the Russian rail
ways, not including those in Finland,
Is estimated at 5,250,000.000 rubles, or
about 99,000 rubles per verst. .
The gross receipts of the railways
(except those of Finland) for 1901, the
latest year for which there are com
plete returns, were 596.802,000 rubles,
\u25a0while the expenditures were 416,
057.000 rubles. In that year there were
employed on the Russian railways a
total of 615,5 M men, who received in
wages an aggregate of 202,075,471
rubles, an average of a little more than
?-2S rubles per man.

come from America, In response to an
appeal published recently in Xew York

The tactics of the revolutionists In St.

might escape arrest. However, they
consented to testify against the pro

ROOSEVEL T CLOSES
TOUR OF THE SOUTH
Begins First Stage of His Return Journey
to the Capital of the Nation.
New Orleans Gives a Most- Enthusiastic
Reception to Our Chief Ruler;
NEW ORLEANS, L,a., Oct. 26.â At the
end of nine strenuous hours of varied
entertainment in New Orleans, which
brought his exceptionally peasant trip
through the South to a close, President
Roosevelt at 6:30 o'clock to-night boarded
the lighthouse tender Magnolia and began
the first stage of his return journey to
the national capital. No newspaper re
porters accompanied him and he will be
out of touch with the world throughout
the night, but daylight to-morrow is ex
pected to bring news of his successful
transfer to- the armored cruiser West
Virginia, which lies at anchor oft the
mouth of the river to receive him, and of
the beginning of the second stage of tho
journey. For four days he will be absent
from American soil, which has never
heretofore happened to a President dur
ing his incumbency, but through the
means of wireless telegraphy it is prom
ised that he will be seldom out of com
munication with the shore. .
The President's New Orleans reception
was a signal testimonial \of popular es
teem and of grateful recognition of the
service which he has . rendered the city
In her period of distress. New Orleans
to-day remembered not only that the
President had acted with characteristic
promptness when asked to send federal
surgeons to take charge of the fever
struggle, but throughout the flght here
sustained the people of the stricken city
with expressionsj'of unfailing sympathy
and, when a large share of the public
opinion of the country opposed his ven
turing into New Orleans with the fever
still prevailing, he refused to consider the
t-lement of-personal danger and declared
his purpose to keep the promise he made
when he accepted the original invitation
to come. ' ...
MET BY CHEERING CROWDS.
The crowd jammed St. Charles street
from property line to property line all
the way from Poydras street to Ninth,
and it spread over Lafayette Square
almost from St. Charles to Camp
streets. Probably 50,000 people were
gathered in and around the .stand from
which the President was to have de
livered the address. When the Presi
dent decided to abandon his effort he
shouted to the throng to go home and
be good citizens, and then disappeared
Into the Mayor's parlors, well-nigh ex
hausted. To -those about him he ex
pressed himself as immensely pleased
with the demonstration in his honor,
which was far beyond his expectations
or the expectations of the members of
his party, and said that the reception
was the greatest that he had had since
he had started on his trip.
The demonstration at the luncheon
was scarcely less exuberant. When
the President entered the superbly dec
orated dining-hall the 625 banqueters
rose and gave way to frantic cheers.
Every thought he uttered was the sig
nal for an extraordinary- exhibition of
enthusiasm, and as his speech dealt
almost entirely with local subjects and
had special -reference to the fight
against yellow fever, the; banquet de
v-eloped into an (Increasing ovation.
At Harapan, ten miles from New Or
leans, the President's car was switched
from the main track of the Illinois
Central and carried over the Belt Line
to Stuyvesant Docks, where the com
modious ocean going Southern Pacific
Bteamer-Comus awaited him. On board
the steamer were 400 of the leading
men and women of the city. Governor
Blanchard and his staff. Dr. White,
who fought the good fight as the Gov
ernment's representative against the
fever, together with all the surgeons in
full uniform, officers of the army and
navy, Mayor Behrmari and leading
Federal, State and city officials.
When the Comus had straightened
she headed up stream with the Presi
dent again on board and ran around
the crescent, past South Port, where
the President was enabled to obtain a
view of the great levees of the Pont
chartrain district and see vast fields
of ripening sugar cane on the planta
tions lying on either side of the river.
A few miles above the city the Comus
turned and went slowly down the river,
passing along the whole front of the
southern metropolis. On either bank
people lined the levees as the steamer,
aflutter with flags, proceeded on her
way amid the din of the sirens of river
craft and shrill whistles of the manu
facturing industries. Passing the Al
giers Point the Comus hugged the west
shore and the President law for the
first time the immense steel floating
dock of the Government and the naval
reservation. Further down on the east
bank of the river he saw the hlitorlc
Urjwlines Convent enshrouded In the
national "colors, the United States bar
racks where several hundred of the
regular soldiers escaped infection dur
ing the faver, the unfinished shaft of
Chalmette marking the battlefield of
New Orleans, and still further on he
got a glimpse of the Federal cemetery
where lie thousands of bodies of tbosa
who perished for the Union. The Co
mus carried the Presidential party be
yond the immense terminals under
construction at Port Chalmette and
then turning, headed back to -the. city.
CROWDS FLOCK TO CITY.
Immediately the Comus was moored,
the parade got under way. The Con
federate veterans held the right of the
line with the Sons of Veterans and the
Spanish War Veterans, made up of sur
vivors of several Louisiana regiments
which had responded to the nation's
call to arms In the most recent of

included numerous! civic bodies, j . ,- ,-â¢:
i r Long before \the parade hati neared
i the City Hall the people began to "con
1 gregate there, and such a dense, lm
-niovable crowd wus never before seen
In this city of annual crowds. Haifa
hundred policemen mounted and on
foot labored for an hour to make a
clear space so that the President's car
riage could come up to the entrance.
MAKES BRIEF SPEECH.
The President realized : that an acci
dent was imminent, and if the crowd
was not soon dispersed there might be
serious trouble/ Jle urged Mayor Behr
man to Introduce ; him immediately,
which was done simply, though the
Mayor's voice- was drowned In the hub
bub. J:; Vr-'v/--; : . I ;'^ v v : . 'â¢ " \u25a0 > Y.v~
The President climbed upon the rail
ins before which he was to speak, sup
ported by the Mayor, though he kept
his balance admirably.
He waved/ his hand to the crowd and
they broke forth with, redoubled vigor.
He urged the crowd to keep still and
called their attention to the fact" that
many women were caught in the jam
and might be injured. Each utterance
of his, though unheard by the mass of
homanity, evoked a cheer and waving
of handkerchiefs and parasols, and then
the President tried to deliver a short
speech. It was impossible and he.real
ized the futility of It
"That's all right," answered the
President. "Stay right there no w,'\ he
added, addressing the t crowd, 'â¢\u25a0 which
was beyond control. v '
The Mayor attempted to secure si
lence and the President began again:
"My fellow countryman: Give me a
chanceâ ," whereat there was a tremen
dous uproar, of applause and a voice
shouted: "We will give you one and we
will give you another.""
Again the President started: "My fel
low countrymen: I appreciate more than
I can cay. this greeting and it is beyond
the power of any human being to ac
knowledge it by speaking, for you could
not hear him. (Great applause.)
"And now you have shown such ex
traordinary qualities throughout this
dreadful summer, that' I want you .to
show your capacity for self-government
(tremendous applause) and that means
don't jam. (Laughter and applause.)
ENTERTAINED AT LUNCHEON.
After a short visit In his .hotel the
President held a series of receptions.
The first was to a group of cpnfederate
veterans who presented to him a watch
charm of crossed Union and Confederate
flags as a souvenir of the trip. The sec
ond of the receptions was to a group of
Grand Army veterans.
The climax of the day's entertainment
was the luncheon which started shortly
after 3 o'clock and was prolonged fifteen
minutes beyond the time set for it, as. a
result of the continuous ovation given to
the President. The President | sat be
neath the pelican flag, with Mayor Behr
man on onÂ©; side , of him and Governor
Blanchard on the other. Governor Blan
chard extended the welcome on behalf of
the. State. ;. ..â¢â¢:' ; ,
When the applause that followed the
toastmaster*s remarks ' introducing him
had subsided the President said in part:
Gentlemen, as you have greeted me so well,
you have given me the opportunity to Indulge
myself in a luxury. There â¢ have been mo
ments in the past when I was afraid of say
ing how well I thought of the Senators and
Representatives in the National Congress from
Louisiana- for fear I might damage them,' Now
I am emboldened by your generous kindness
and confidence to say I that it has been in
deed a pleasure to deal with Louisiana's rep
resentatives in the Senate and -in 'the lower
house of Congress, because whenever I had to
do with a great question of national Importance
I could go to them convinced that if I could
show them It was really for the good of the
nation, they would stand for it.;
Now. from the representatives of Louisiana
I was - sure of support, whether' it , was a
question of building up and keeping at a high
point of efficiency the United States navy
or whether It was a question of building the
Panama canal. And mind you, gentlemen,
the two questions go together. One thing that
as President of this country I won't do is
to make a bluff that I can't make good. I
don't intend on behalf of the nation to take
any position until^l have carefully thought
out whether that position will be advantageous
to the nation, but If I . like it I am going to
keep it. And I am sure that you gentlemen
know it has been a mistake to think of me as
a man desirous of seeing this nation quarrel
some. I have no respect either for thÂ« nation
or for the individual that brawls.
SPEAKS OF PANAMA CANAJU
I want to seÂ» this nation do as thÂ« Individ-'
ual men in thÂ« nation who would respect
themselves should do, - scrupulously regardful
of the rights of others and honestly endeavor
ing to avoid all cause of difficulty.. But I
want, on behalf of this nation, the \u25a0 peace that
comes not to the coÂ«vard who cringes for It,
but. the peace of the just man armed, who
asks it as a right.

See Our Fall Suits With the New Peak Lapels
. Have you seen the new peak lapelâ the lapel on single breasted suits that
is the subject for conversation whenever men's clothes are being discussed?
In the Eastern States the careful dressers are demanding the peak lapel on
all garments. It is one of the biggest hits in clothes for some time.
The peak lapel is broad, flat and cut low so as to show a portion of the
vest. It gives a single breasted coat a broad effect, making the wearer look
athletic in buifd.
Now we knew that the peak lapel would be the thing this season, so made
up hundreds of suits in this style at prices ranging from $15.00 up.
Another thing â gray is the color â gray worsteds, gray cheviots, gray cassi-
meresâ they have the call from New York to San* Francisco. Gray is selling
ten to one over.,any other color.
This we also knew would happen, so months ago we ordered our workshops
to make gray suits â and here they, are for you from $15.00 up.
Men ? s Suits in New Fall Styles $1 j-QQ,
You haven't an idea of what $11.00 will buy in clothes until you see these suits.
The materials are blue serge, black Thibets and gray, and brown mixtures in cheviots

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, ; 1005;
RIVAL CONVENTIONS
ARE ORGANIZED.
DECLINE TO TAKE PLEDGE
Split Among Delegates to Interstate
Commerce Law Assemblage.
CHICAGO. Oct. 26.â Refusing to stand
for President Roosevelt's policy for the
regulation of railroad rates, a large num
ber of delegates to the Interstate Com
merce Law Convention were barred from
the convention of that organization to
day and thereupon held a separate meet
ing to give expression to their ideas on
the subject. The original convention was
held in Steinway Hall, while the "anti"
convention met in 'Music or Studebaker
Hall, several blocks away.
Aware of alleged attempts to thwart the
purpose of the convention, the delegates
at Steinway Hall refused to 1 admit dele
gates,' although properly accredited, un
less they would agree to .support the
President's rate plan. These delegates ob
jected to the procedure,/ demanding they
be given the right of iree. speech, while
the opposition charged they were sent
by the railroads and other alleged unfair
Interests to pack the convention. A num
ber of exciting scenes followed before the
meetings weer called to order. The num
ber of delegates at each convention was
about equal, ranging between four and
five hundred. Speeches, organization and
resolutions. Including one which was pre
sented in the Studebaker Hall convention
asking the President to settle the dis
pute as to which was the regular con
vention, but upon which no action was
taken, occupied the time of the first
meetings of the convention. The con
vention will continue in session to-mor
row, when resolutions will be adopted by
the Steinway Hall convention in favor
of the President's policy.
RAILROAD FACTION' MEETS.
The so-called "Railroad" faction of the
delegates to the convention met at the
green room of the Auditorium Annex this
morning -to prepare for a conflict with
the "Regulars" at Convention Hall. Prior
to the meeting at the Auditorium Annex
coal dealers who are identified with the
"Railroad" element met at the Great
Northern Hotel and after satisfying them
selves that their credentials were sat
isfactory, proceeded In a body to the
Annex, where D. M. Parry, president of
the National Manufacturers' Association,
and other so-called "Railroad" delegates
were assembled.
Parry, mounted upon a table, acted
as chairman of the meeting, with a
cane as a gavel.
"We are advocates of free speech,"
said Parry, "and we demand our right
to be heard. I understand that we are
to be deprived of uor right to be heard
In the convention unless we sign a cer
tain pledge. "What Is your pleasure?"
W. A. Meese of Michigan moved that
the delegates go to the convention in a
body and If refused admittance retire
to Studebaker Hall, where a second
convention could be held. This mo
tion was met with some opposition and
was tabled. A motion that the dele
gates gro as individuals was made and
carried./
Badges, reading "Interstate Law
Convention, Supervision, Not Commer
cial Revolution," were thereupon .dis
tributed. Wearing the badges con
spicuosly, all the delegates at the Au
ditorium Annex meeting, headed by D.
M. Parry and Robert Lake of Michigan,
marched in a body to Steinway Hall,
where the so-called "Bacon" or "reg
ular" delegates were assembled.
POLICE GUARD THE DOORS.
Vollowing the plan decided upon by
an executive committee to avoid a clash
with the dissenting, or Parry faction,
no delegates had been admitted to the
convention except those who subscribed
to what the officers of the organization
called "the creed and articles of faith,"
which indorsed President Roosevelt's
message asking enabling legislation by
Congress enlarging the powers pf the
Interstate Commerce Commission, so
that It may regulate the freight rates,
subject to Judicial review. In addition
to police, half a dozen "regular" dele
gates guarded every door leading to
the hall and all who had not signed
the Indorsement of President Roose
velt's message were denied, admission.
-mong the first delegates to subscribe
to the principles of the convention and
gain admittance was L. W. Noyes, rep
resenting the Illinois Manufacturers'
Association. Mayor Dunne also was an
early arrival and he congratulated the
officers, on their decision to bar dele
gates charged with being in sympathy
with the railroads. '
"I will see that you have all the po
licemen needed to hold your convention
without Interference from the railroad
lobbyists." said Mayor Dunne.
Judge S. H. Cowan received the fol
lowing telegram from Washington just
before the convention was called to or
der: .
JtidÃ'e.T. H. Cowan: I hope that thÂ» cÂ«"n
vntlon w'll reÂ«!st to the utmost the admitUtnc*
of any delegate who will not i'pi"the p-o-
PÂ«*Â«<J pledge. Lot the railroad hired men px
hllilt their free pasre? and jro home. If they
outnumber you by violence, go elsewhere and
hold a Roosevelt convention.
W. K. CHANDLER.
Former United States Senator from New
Hampshire.
REFUSE TO SIGN PLEDGE.
The first disturbance was created by
F. J. Kiesel of Ogden, Utah, said to.be
a representative of the railroad fac
tion. He entered the ante-room of the
hotel and demanded that the statement
which delegates were asked to sign
be read aloud. The clerk In charge
of the registration declined and Kiesel
shouted "All in favor of my sugges
tion, say aye." Three voices responded.
Then somebody asked for those op
posed and there was a lusty shout of
"no" from a score or more of delegates.
"I \u25a0 will never surrender my rights as
an American citizen by putting my
name in that book,', shouted Delegate'
Kiesel. -Â± will not slg-n away my birth
right."
Followed by several friends the dele
gate then left the room. In the ab
sence of E. C. Bacon, chairman of the
executive committee, who Is ill. Judge
S. H. Cowan of Texas, who called the
convention to order*, said:
I know that the delegates ' who are her*
will abide by the action of the executive com
mittee and indorse the railroad ra\e re&ula '
tlon advocated by our great President. Tlico
dore Roceevelt. . We might have hart morÂ«

PARRY DELEGATES RETIRE.
The mention of President Roosevelt's
name was greeted with long: continued
applause. . \u25a0 " s.
;R. W.Hlgbee of. New .York, was "cho
sen, chairman of the â¢ convention!"; Mean
while the- Parry "procession .of dele
gates had reached Steinway Hall. Tha
doorkeeper offered F. : H. j Mason,' secre
tary- of the j Buffalo' Chamber; of,
merce, a pledge v already ; prepared. :C Af
ter looking/at the ; pledge. I Mason' tsaid:
"I iam a regularly accredited

"I 'will not do so/M'roturned/; Mason.
-H. .C, ,'EI wood,' chairman: of , the^ Buff a
lo;delegation, was : 'refused .admittance.
Then one by one- the -other, Parry fdele-^
gates ' went to \u25a0 the 'Jdoor;f and : ; ' were ::\u25a0 re
fused: When , the last-man- had-' been
refused admittance? the 'Parry :nartv
went in a body to Studebaker Hall
where nearly 200 delegates assembled
for a so-called "Rump" convention.'
F. J. Bradley of Haverhlll, Mass., was
elected temporary .chairman of the
Studebaker Hall convention and made
a brief speech advocating calm and
dispassionate discussion of the matters
under consideration.
T. B. Aldrich of Colorado was select
ed secretary. \u25a0
: Delegate W. A. Meese characterized
the meeting at Steinway Hall as "a
meeting ruled by two policemen and
one man." ; .
Delegate Meese offered a resolution
to appoint a committee to present the
debarred delegates' grievances, to the
Bacon meeting- in session at Steinway
Hall. â¢ Motions and amendments fol
lowed thick and fast. The main point
of conflict was the right of the dele
gates to vote as State representatives.
It was finally decided, after the Meese
motion had been defeated, to have -a
rollcall of States for the appointment
of one delegate from each State as a
member of a committee on credentials.
After the appointment of the cre
dentials committee a recess until 2
o'clock was taken.
SIAYOR DUXXE ATTENDS.
At Steinway Hall, meanwhile. Mayor
Dunne warmly welcomed the delegates
who signed the Roosevelt pledge. â¢
E. P. Campbell of Ohio. In responding
to Mayor Dunne's address of welcome,
said: . â¢ â¢,
It is unfortunate that the railroad interest*
attempted to interfere with- this 'convention.
It is a mistake to attempt to combat public
opinion. We are here to indorse President
Roosevelt's plan of governmental regulation 01
railroad rates. I am in favor of Koine even
further than the President, but I am also
heartily in favor of supporting him.
John W. Kern, fepresentlng the In
dianapolis Commercial Association, -.ex
plained that D. M. Parry is a member of
the Indiana 'organization and that after
a sharp contest Parry's efforts to Instruct
the delegates against the Roosevelt rate
regulation plan were defeated by a vote
of 10 to l.
CONVENTION CALL EXPLICIT.
Former Governor S. R. Van Sant of
Minnesota said:
There is no ambiguity in the call for thtÂ»
convention. No one has been deceived 01
brought here under false pretenses. Our flgru
is an open one and our platform proclaimed
to the world. We stand squarely upon that
platform and will fight it out upon that line.
After the secretary had read the call
for the convention the chairman ap
pointed committees on credentials and
permanent organization and the conven
tion took a recess.
About 500 delegates signed the pledge
which made them eligible to enter the
Steinway Hall convention.
The so-called "anti" convention recon
vened in the afternoon in Studebaker
Hall and the "regular" met an hour later
in Steinway Hall.
While the Studebaker Hall meeting was
in session the Steinway Hall convention
perfected organization by the' election of
the following officers:
Chairman, W. E. Hughes, Colorado;
vice chairman, John W. Kern. Indiana;
secretary,- P. E. Goodrich. Indiana. ..
,The report of the committee on creden
tials was read and approved and all dele
gates in the hall were seated. v
CALIFORNIA* OX COMMITTEE.
Among those on the committee on reso
lutions were appointed J. W. Call, Cali
fornia, and H. A. Holmes, Kansas. . A
communication was received from the
other railroad advocates at Studebaker
Hall, saying It was "the convention," and
asking the "regulars" to join with them.
This caused much discussion, and the
"enemy" was hotly denounced by J. W.
Call of California and others.
A committee was appointed to reply to
the communication.
The convention then adjourned until
to-morrow morning.
PARRY .MAKES SPEECH.
At the Studebaker Hali convention 435
delegates were placed on the roll call.
N. W.. McLeod of St. Louis was chosen
chairman and G. X. Wendellng of Cali
fornia one of the vice presidents. ' .
D. M. Parry, leader of the delegates,
then made a speech, in which he said in
part:
I am here to reflect the opinion of those
shippers who believe In carefully considered
action and who also believe that every indus
try, including even the railroad iudustry, is
entitled to tair treatment and the enjoy jnenl
of those rights of property which . are accord
ed to other industries. . ,
' I confidently believe that all of the fair
minded men, if they give due study to the
question, will come to the conclusion that the
power to make rates should continue to lodge
where It is. and that thereby the general in
terests jof the country will be best subserved,
the' right 'Of communities to enjoy the advan
tages of population, wealth and geographical
location will bo respected; the less developed
sections will not be at the mercy of the more
powerful sections, and rates will on the whole
gradually decline while the services rendered
by the carriers will develop In efficiency.
. AJfter the speech an adjournment was
taken until to-morrow.-

AT VIVISECTION
Not ; Enamored of Idea
Suggested by the President
of Nebraska University
VIEWS OF THREE MEN
One Willing to Be Operated
Upon if Freedom Would
Follow His Recovery
Epeclal Despatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. :6.-"Shou!d condemned
murderers be vivisected?"
This question, by Chancellor E. Benja
min Andrews of the University of Ne
braska, in an address in Lincoln. Neb.,
>esterday, was put to three condemned
murderers at the county jail to-day. They
discussed it with vigor.
â¢ Johann Iloch. "Jocko"* Briggs and John
Mueller, the first two of whom have ob
tained a respite and the other having
been sentenced on Saturday to be hanged
December 15, failed to agree on the ad
visability of submitting themselves to.
Burgeons. Mueller and Briggs" repudiated
tfce idea. Hoch favored it to a certain
\u25a0extent.
It was explained to Mueller, on his say
ing he would "rather face the rope,"
that Professor Andrews suggesteu that it
would be well where criminals volun
teered to be made subjects of anatomical
study to expunge their criminal records.
Tht suggestion carries with it some hope
of freedom where u.e criminals recovered
from intricate operations. A light of hope
ehot into Mueller's face.
' I'd take a chance on tnat, I believe."
he said, at last. "If 1 recovered I might
be happy again, and I'd know I had done
humanity some good, anyway."
Briggs walked up to the bars. The
question of vivisection was explained to
him.
"I wouldn't stand for it," he declared,
positively. "I'd rather take the rope, if
all hope were gone."
VVhen Briggs was speaking Hoch re
garded him contemplatively. Then he
turned and paced a short distance down
the corridor.
"I don't want any speculation about It,"
declared Johann, as he turned to give
his final opinion. "I wouldn't want to
hope for recovery. I would want to know
the doctors would never let me wake up.
I'd be willing, for the sake of humanity,
to let the doctors chloroform me and
get to work on my body. What's a man's
,l!fe worth if he gets out and everybody
points Ire finger at him and calls him a
murderer? I'd rather have the doctors
than the rope if the high court decided
'against me."

MISS ESTELLE BEXDEK OF THE STAR SHOW GIRLS COMPANY WHO WAS
SERIOUSLY INJURED EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING BY THE OVER
TURNING OF AN AUTOMOBILE ON THE OCEAN BOULEVARD.
Estelle Bender, a chorus girl In the

the police, engaged Chauffeur Ben
Mendoza, who was standing outside
Spider Kellv's saloon, Eddy street, to
take them for a drive to the park and
boulevard.
They went to Tom's Cabin. Stanyan
and Fell streets, where the party had
some drinks. Three young men drove
up In an auto, one of them, known as
"Hook Hand," and followed the four
girls out to Sheehan's Tavern, where
they all got out and partook of liquid
refreshment. After Indulging in sev
eral drinks three of the girls joined
the men. Miss Bender speeding along
with Mendoza toward Dibble's resort.
On reaching a point between H and I
streets the auto collided with a sand
bank and turned over, pinning Miss
Bender beneath Its ponderous weight.
She remained In her perilous posi
tion for half an hour, during which
time Chauffeur Mendoza ran around the
neighborhood calling for assistance
and knocking at doors. Fremont Older,
\u25a0who occupies a car at the beach, was
one to respond to the call and hurried
with Mendoza to give whatever aid was
In his power.
With some effort the automobile was
lifted, off the prostrate form -of
the girl and she was conveyed to the
Park Emergency Hospital by an auto
mobillst who was hailed by Older.-
Besides being fearfully bruised with
contuslonson the hlps.elbow and back,
It Is possible that Miss Bender sus
tained serious Internal injuries. She
was taken later to the St. James Hotel.

JEROME SURE
OF ELECTION
New York Republicans Will

CHANGE IN SENTIMENT
Executive Committee Alters
Its Attitude Toward
the Independent Candidate
NEW YORK, Oct. 26.â With only one
dissenting voice and acting under a legal
opinion rendered by Joseph H. Choate, the
executive committee of the â¢ Republican
county convention late to-day decided to
reconvene the New York county conven
tion to-morrow nlsht, the call for the
convention carrying with it the recom
mendation that "William Travers Jerome
be nominated as District Attorney to nil
the vacancy created yesterday by the res
ignation of Charles A. Flammer, who. In
retiring: from the ticket, advised his fol
lowers to vote Cor Jerome.
The committee, which almost unani
mously voted for Jerome to-day, opposed
his nomination by twenty-seven votes to
eight when his name was â¢ suggested for
the Republican ticket a few weeks ago.
â¢\u25a0 Former President Grover 'Cleveland
has written a letter to Mayor George
B. McClellan. in which 'he indorses the
latter's candidacy for re-election as
Mayor. of New York, saying:, among
other things:
I confess to a feeling: of astonishment when
I ice the evidences or rank hysteria pervad
ing a canvass which should especially jbe
characterized by sober thoughtfulness. Ques
tions of the most far-reaching- importance term
to be pressed upon the city's voters, not so
much as subjects demanding: their serious re
flection and thorough information, as sub
jects furnishing opportunity for appeals to
passion and misinformation cunningly Intended
to aid personal ambitions and unworthy pur
poses.
There are conditions just now prevailing
which n&turally suggest this as a favorable
time for demagogic manipulation of the peo
ple and nowhere are these conditions so in
viting to those who are willing to bÂ« dem
agogues as in the city of New York. \u25a0
Every man who thinks must know that tna
opportunity thus offered to play upon ths
unusually aroused popular prejudices, resent
ments and passions has not been overlooked
and that the constant stimulation of these
things constitutes the chief stock in trade of
some oÂ£ those who are now bidding for thÂ»
people's support. Every thinking man must
also appreciate the fact that there are prin
ciples and theories underlying the pending,
municipal canvass ' which vitally concerns thÂ»
city's future life.
In these circumstances how plainly it i&
the duty of every voter who has the welfare
of your great municipality at heart to avert
the danger threatened by rash notions or by
the neglect of a good citizen's duty to strive
against the tide of demagogic mlsrepresanta
tlon.
It Is because I believe you are looking ltv
this direction of dutiful citizenship and rep
resent the steadiness and honest conservatism
the city needs that I earnestly hope for your
election.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
LOGAN'S FATHER VISITS
HIM IN OAKLAND PRISON
The father of Henry A. Logan, the church trustee who eloped from Oakland Ayith 16ry ear-old
Ethel Cook, visited him in jail yesterday, but left town without making arrangements .to furnisK bail, for
him. Notes found on Logan show that he feared mob violence when confined in the Medford jail. It
develops that he was discharged from a Sacramento grocery house by which he was employed as porter
for breaking open cases of liquor and drinking the beverages.
Makes No Effort to
Supply Bail for
His Erring Son
Notes Show Prison
er Was in Terror
in Medford Jail
OAKLAND, Oct 26.â That Henry A.
JJogan, the renegade church trustee
who eloped from this city with Ethel
Cook, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, is not
the guileless victim of a hopeless love
he would have the people of this city
believe, is the opinion of the police. It
develops that Logan had an unenvi
able record in Sacramento, where he
was employed as porter in a wholesale
grocery house. He was discharged be
cause he was inattentive to duty and it
was suspected he had broken into
cases containing liquor and drank it.
(Subsequently he was In the employ of
c commission firm and told a story
\u25a0while there of having prevented the
breaking of the safe by a burglar. It
Is suspected that he tampered with the
â¢afe nimself with the view of gaining
favor with his employers by telling
how he prevented a robbery.
.When asked this morning' whether
he had ever been in trouble before,
Logan did not make a denial, but de
clined to make any statement. With
downcast eyes and pale face he said:
*'I prefer not to talk any more, and
xnust refer you to my attorney." He
has retained Judge A, L. Frick to de
fend him on the charge of child steal
log.
On his arrival at police headquar
ters, Logan vehemently denied that
there had -been any attempt to take
feim from the Jail at Medford, but an
other story is told by the authorities,
And this is borne out by the following
notes written by Logan when he heard
the uproar outside the Medford jail and
thought he was about to meet sudden
punishment for his crime:
October 16, 1905.
So we are caught. But alas, ire are not
sad, but happy. I hope every one will be as
happy as we ere. But we can go. Just the
came.
Tto My Mother: /
May God forgive me, but I loved the dear
girl. She would have been happy. I hope
you will forgive me. I did hate to go before I
â¢aw you. but It had to be. I hope everybody
will forgive me, because it was another case
ef love.
I hope all wiJl be forgotten Boon, for I was
always trying my best to live a good life. It
1* hard to go. but better than being a â well,
you know. What will become of me now?
Good-by father, mother and sisters. Your son
and brother. HENRY.
Tv whom it may concern:
I Jii.\c tried and felled. It is better to have
lovod and lost, than never to have loved at all.
She was a good girl, and is as pure as the
day I took her. I swear before God I was
true to her, and never harmed her. j May God
forgive .me for this, but it is all over now. I
Â«.:.> porry for the onr. and one only. The dear
girl. I know she shall be as happy as some of
thÂ« rest of the people, but here goes a man
*ho loved and lost.
Logan's father, who resides In
Sacramento. arrived in Oakland
last night and called at the City Pris
on to see the son who has brought dis
irrace on his name. He had a long con
ference with the renegade church trus
tee, but on leaving he said nothing
about bail for his son, and the author
ities bolieve that he is not going to
come to the rescue of the imprisoned
tnan. Logan bag been confident that his
relatives would furnish bail for his
appearance, but his hopes seem doomed
to disappointment. )
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 26. â P. C.
Drescher of Mebius & Drescher, whole
sale grocers, says Logan was employed
by his firm as porter about Gve years
ego. He was inattentive to duty and
it was suspected he broke into cases
containing liquor and drank it. He
\u25a0was discharged.
Subsequently ' Logan worked for
Castle Brothers, commission merchants,
a.nd one night he told at the police sta
tion of finding a man in the act of
breaking open the cafe. It was be
lieved be broke the safe himself to
make himself solid with his employers,
Nothing came of this matter.

ABDUCTING SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD ETHEL COOK.
MAN AND WOMAN
HELD FOR ARSON
OAKLAND, Oct. 26.â Charged with hav
ing deliberately set fire to their dry goods
store In the Crichton building at Point
Richmond, J. S. Mayer and his wife are
held at the Martinez County Jail for ar
son. Their bail was fixed at $5000 each
by Justice of the Peace Hull, but so far
they have been unable to furnish that
amount and they are etlll in custody.
The flre broke out early yesterday morn
ing and before the firemen could do any
effective work three buildings were de
stroyed. ,
Mayer and his . wife conducted the
Eastern Dry Goods store on Richmond
avenue. Early yesterday morning Mayer
went to San Francisco and about 8
o'clock Mrs. J. Osborne, who went into
the store to make a purchase, noticed a
blaze in the interior of the building.
At the same time E. B. Flinton, a pa
perhanger, saw flames in the kitchen.
John Spiersch, a plumber, also noticed
the two blazes. The fact that the fire
started in two places led to the belief
that it was of incendiary origin and Mrs.
Mayer was arrested Immediately. Her
husband was not taken into custody until
S o'clock in the afternoon, when he re
turned from San Francisco. The May
ers went to Point Richmond a few
months ago and engaged in business.
The other merchants of the town have
been suspicious and when the fire oc
curred yesterday, H. B. Kenney, who
lived with his family in the upper story,
promptly swore to the complaints charg
ing the Mayers with arson.
The total damages from the disastrous
conflagration have now been appraised
as follows: William Crichton, $5000;
Thomas Schad, $9000; J. C. Mayer. $3500;
H. B. Kenney, $1300; D. Entrican, $1000;

NELSON AGREES
TO COMPROMISE
v OAKLAND, Oct. 26.â After every
thing: was in readiness for a battle over
the will of the late Margaretha Hilde
brand Nelson, who died after a short
year of married happiness, leaving her
share in the estate: of ; her father, val
ued at $200,000, to her young hus
band, the contest was suddenly aban
doned this morning by the sister and
brother of the deceased woman.
They charged in their complaint
that the holographic will: left
by her was not entirely In her hand
writing, which, if it could have been
proven, would have invalidated the
Instrument.
James Nelson, who is well known in
Alameda'and Oakland, had employed
former State Senator E. K. Taylor to
fight the . contest to the bitter end, as
he considered the charge implied that
the document was a forgery, and pho
tographs and drawings gof it, several
feet in length, had been made by hand
writing experts as exhibits in the case.
The contestants were William H." Hilde
brand and Mrs. Anna Hildebrand Ship
ley. The family Is a- well-known, one
In Alameda and San Francisco, where
Henry Hildobrand, the' father, left a
large estate in real property.. The
three children were his only heirs, and
Nelson is entitled to one-third of the
estate. The contestants had employed
H. C. McPike and D. M. Delmas as their
attorneys. :

BERKELEY, -Get; 26.â "C0-eds" who
Insist upon the wearing: of hats in
classrooms are made the subject of a
pathetic editorial plea from the pen of
11 D. Bohnett In the current issue of
the student paper, the Californian. Boh
nett hn.B seen the evil that follows the
habit of :._ wearing picture and: other
hats in classrooms where savants aro
attempting to instruct collegians, ] and
pleads with the women students to dis
continue forever the practice he de
plores. His editorial, which reads as
folio W3, has the backing of the male
contingent of the student body, whose
plight he feelingly describes:
History teaches us that Cato's oft repeated
"Carthago delenda est" was a chief cause of
the destruction of a great city. There are
students In the university who are anxiously
looking for a second Cato insistent enough with
his "big hats must go" to free the lecture
room of one of Its greatest nuisances. Wa have
no intention of attempting to play thÂ« role.
But we do want to say a word or two in
support of the demand for the removal of hats
In the classroom.
Certain Instructors have refused to allow
men to sit in their classes clad in sweaters.
The stand was a good oneJ President Wheeler
has repeatedly intimated that the appearance
of the men students could be greatly improved
by ordinary care in the matter of dress. \u25a0 His
stand also is a good one. But . the big hat
is a far greater nuisance than the sweater or
the careless attire of the men. The latter
may violate good taste, but the big hat vio
lates the rights of every, student who Is 'so
unlucky as to sit behind it. Every student
likes to see his. Instructor often enough to be
abl<Â» to recognize him when he meets him on
the campus. And even the wearers of big
halH will admit that it does add somewhat to
the interest of a lecture to be able to get an
occasional glimpse of the lecturer.
The women themselves started a campaign
last year against hats on the campus. Many
of them still keep their promises, but there is
opportunity for the number to crow. - . .
"RUNNING"
OF SOCIETY
ON CAMPUS
BERKELEY, Oct. 26. â The usual mystery
surrounds the . preparations of the Skull and
Keys Society for its annual "running" on the
campus to-morrow. It Is an event utilized
for the initiation, in part, of those chosen for
membership In the unique society. The fa
culty has not interfered to prevent the "run
ning" this year, despite the objections that
were made to the affair last winter, and so
the annual . spectacle of favored students,
decked out in grotesque garb, go{ng through
spectacular "stunts," will again 'delight the
multitude. The "running" will r not. b^. made,
however, from the Greek Theater through the
campus to the football Held as of old. I The
authorities objected, to that, as It brought the
excitement bo close to the- colleges as to in
terfere with, studies. The start will , be made
to-morrow from the new football field, on the
Hlllegass tract, and will end under the oaks,
on the lower part of the campus. The speak
ing will be done on a platrorm to be erected
close to the Oxford \u25a0 street entrance to the
grounds. The exercises are scheduled to be
gin at 3:30 o'clock..
The members of the German department
and students in the upper division of German
courses have received an invitation- to inspect
the German cruiser, the Falke, now lying In
the bay. The trjp will be made next Saturday
afternoon. 'Professor Schilling, head of tho
German department, entertained the officers
Of the Falke at dinner last Sunday. .
The following- freehmen have been chosen
to represent the class in its debate on Novem
ber 17 with the sophomores: C.-H. Cunning
ham, H. D. Hoover and W. H. Plllsbury. with
A. Kilgore as alternate.
An "Old Folks' Social" is to be given by
the women members of the class of '05, in
Hearst Hall, on the night before the big foot
ball game. The class reunions are for men
only, and because of this the women students
df ciJed upon an Innovation in' the form of this
social for themselves.
The half . hour of music to be held at 4
o'clock next Sunday afternoon. October 2tt,
will be under the direction of W. J. McCoy.
The programme will be as follows:

Committee of Professors
Appointed to Stop Knocks
at the Stanford University
PROMPTED BY "BOGIE"
Matter Under Consideration,
but Action Is Quickened
by the Late Publication
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 26.â
In order to prevent the students of
Stanford University from carrying: too
far Joshes and "knocks" that always
appear ! in the junior class plug: ugly,
which is due to appear shortly, Presi
dent David Starr Jordan has appointed
Instructor E. K. Putnam to act as an
advisory committee of one. r All manu
scripts must be submitted, to the rep
resentative of the 5 faculty before the
authorities will allow v them to be pre
sented. ; The action is unparalleled In
the history of the institution and bids
fair to stir up dissatisfaction In the
community.
â¢ It is believed to have been brought
to a. head by the recent appearance of
the "Bogie." The faculty probably sur
mised that from the tone of thl3 pub
lication a general spirit of revolt
existed among the students and that
the junior show, which is at beat pure
ly a rough house affair, might turn out
to be of indecent nature.
There are at present three pieces un
der way. The boat club will produce
"All Tangled Up" to-morrow night.
The piece was 'written by a professional
playwright and will probably suffer no
correction. The football show is of
like authorship, but as it is to be local
ized to a marked extent it will prob
ably be carefully considered.

for improving the Town
PALO AX.TO, Oct. 25.â Plans for a pub
lic^ boulevard and park to; take. in the
land from Alma street along San Fran
cisquito, Creek to the northern end or
Palo Alto avenue are bein* favorably dlsw
cussed here. The matter will be pre
sented to the Board of Trade for action
at its next meeting.
Commencing at the famous landmark
from which the town was named, thq
Palo Alto tree, and extending north
about a mile, Is a strip of land varying
in width from fifty to three hundred feet.
It follows the windings of the creek. Us
heavily wooded with live cak trees, and
is admirably situated for the purpose.
The residents here feel it can be more
easily made into a park than any blocK
of barren land in town.
San Francisquito Creek forms the
present western and northern boun
daries of this place. With the installa
tion of the' Pope street bridge, opening
the territory farther north to settlement,
the project is considered most feasible.
The running water through tlta middle of
the proposed park will also add to its
natural beauties.
This land belongs to Timothy Hopkins
of San Francisco, and those Interested
In the proposition are in favor of asking
him to donate It to Palo Alto.

Headache
When your head aches, there ;
is a storm in thel nervous sys-
tem, centering in the brain.
This irritation produces -pain
in the head, and the turbulent
nerve current sent to the stom-
ach causes nausea, vomitings
This is sick headache, and
is dangerous, as frequent and
prolonged attacks weaken the
brain, resulting in loss of
memory, inflammation, epi-
lepsy, fits, dizziness, etc.
Allay this stormy, irritated,
aching condition by taking
Dr. -Miles' Anti-Pain Pills.
They stop the pain by sooth-
ing, strengthening and rcliev-*
ing the tension upon the nerves
. â not by paralyzing them, aa
do most headache remedies.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills do
not contain opium, morphine,
chloraljcocaine or similar drugs.
."Sick headache ia hereditary in my

TACOMA, Oct. 26. â The British ship
William Mitchell arrived to-day thirty
five days out from San Francisco with
a crew and officers thoroughly disgust
ed with the long voyage which was due
to headwinds during the entire trip.
Captain Gaze declares, that never be
fore in his seafaring experience has it
taken him so long to cover the same
distance. As. the vessel neared Cape
Flattery, Captain Gaze was fearful lest
fogs or changing winds should causa
him trouble.. He was picked up oft

Wanderer and towed into" port.
During five days (120 hours) of the
voyage the ship made only five miles.
The officers and crew believe that sea-,

them swam alongside until the tug
took the ship in tow. The Mitchell is
under charter to Balfour Guthrle & Co.

all of the entire offering of Salvage from the wrecked steamer Alameda. These goods consti-
tute the remaining Salvage . taken ' from the ship and include several lines not yet offered .to
the general public. Our purchase -included wines and liquors, men's furnishings, dry goods,
-400 French dressed dolls, 1500. baseballs and other goods, all of which we shall place on sale

LABOR CONDITIONS IN NEW YORK.
IMPROVEMENT in the condition of trade and industry and in
the opportunities for workmen to find employment. is most sat
isfactorily shown by the Bulletin of the Department of Labor,
State of New- York, for September. In some ways the figures show
quite an astonishing betterment, and inasmuch as great improve
ments in the metropolis and its State are likely to be an index point
ing to general advance throughout the whole country this latest
report of the department will receive wide welcome. Progress was
steadily climbing a climax until the last month of the last quarter
figures up in the bulletin as a record breaker. )
This is most fjuicklv noted by considering the tables of the
numbers of idle workmen. The betterment for the first half of this
year is decided over the three previous Years of 1902-4; but the most
surprising showing is seen when we notice the advance month by
month. In January there were 22.5 per cent of unemployed mem
bers of representative organizations of wage earners, and by the
months of May and June there were only 8 to 9 per cent of unem
ployed. There are several contributory causes for this change, but
the" main one is said to be the renewed activity in trade. Another
cause is the peaceful settlement of disputes between employers and
employes: and a third is the efficiency of labor organizations in se
curing position^ for skilled workmen. >
Reports from trade unions embracing a membership of 100,000
show that they have only 151 unemployed members per thousand
as compared with 202 last year. At the beginning. of July this year
the proportion is only 91 as compared with 145 in 1902. Some spe
cial trades show remarkable activity ; for instance, the iron, steel and
machinery industries show a decline of the unemployed from 147
to 42 per 1000: the woodworkers from 287 to 93; tobacco from 87 to
36. and clothing from 384 to 102. The avoidance of strikes and lock
outs is largely to be credited with these wonderful figures; in the
last quarter of the year there was only one considerable dispute,
namely, that of the New York building industry.
This Xew York building industry is another subject of aston
ishment. The buildings begun in Xew York City this spring were
7316. as compared with 3164 a year ago. The permits issued for
the second quarter of this year amount to the great sum of 578.
417,896: and for the first haff of 1905 the projected buildings exceed
the cost of those projected in the whole twelve months of either 1902
or 1903. Other cities of Xew York State are also increasing their
building operations; Buffalo for the second quarter of 1905 au
thorized construction to the amount of $2,370,237.
So great has been the general improvement from the many con
tributing causes that there has been a reorganization of the Free
Employment Bureau, because that institution is only partially used.
This was to take effect after October 1, and hereafter the bureau will
be simply an office of registration for wage earners who are seek
ing employment.
JAPAN'S NEXT JOB.
NOT so spectacular as her surprisingly effective war work will
be the task which Japan must now of necessity set herself dil
igently to perform, but the opportunity in it is greater ; it will
require the same intense and concentrated energy, and it will be a
century-long undertaking if it is to be brought to such successful
issue as the late brilliant war will lead the world to expect of the
young giant of civilization. Count Okuma, once Minister of For
eign Affairs and now leader of the progressive party, has been
.lalking about it to the Associated Chambers of Commerce at Tokio.
Now that peace has come to Japan without any payment of in
demnity the debt she is burdened with is the vast sum of $1,250,000,
000. The annual interest will be $75,000,000, and to appreciate the im
mensity of that sum to young Japan jt is to be remembered that it
is nearly twice the sum that ten years ago the revenue from all fiscal
sources yielded. The per capita share in the national debt is four
times what it was two years ago, and is now $25 per head. Considering
the comparatively small earnings of the bulk of the Mikado's people,
this is an immense load of debt. It is expected to act as a guarantee
of peace so far as Japan's aggression is concerned for generations to
come; and as for any power attacking the little empire, the treaty
recently made with Great Britain assures her of safety from any
unjust quarrel. The uneasiness that Japan might cast covetous
glances upon the Philippines seems unfounded on correct calcula
tion of the trend of events: for European and American financiers
would assist no more unless Japan shows sincere intent for peace.
As for the temptation, or the necessity, of her statesmen to, find
some new outlet for the surplus population, that will not need the
Philippines, for Korea is thinly populated and the Japanese will
have free hand in developing it. >
When Japan failed to win her contention for a war indemnity
it at first sight seemed as if the net result of the war was all glory
but no profit for victorious Japan ; but her material gains will be im
mense. The New York Sun is authority for the statement that the
group of coal mines adjoining the Japanese section of the Man
churian Railway which have been transferred to Japan by the treaty
of Portsmouth are alone capable, if vigorously worked, of paying
the interest on the entire public debt. Besides that, the coal in
the southern half of Saghalien, which Japan won, is of much finer
quality than is elsewhere to be had in the Mikado's empire; and the
fishing privileges granted on the Russian littoral, from Vladivostok
to Bering Straits, are worth from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 a year.
So there is both intense necessity and immense encouragement for
Japan to be diligently peaceful and industriously enterprising, for
these are but parts of her great opportunities of the aftermath of
THE MINERS' CONVENTION.
T") RESIDENT BENJAMIN of the Miners' Association ' has de
|^ cided, wisely, that its meetings shall be hejld in the mining dis
* tricts of the State. This is good sense and good policy. Not
withstanding the progress of Alaska,- Colorado and Nevada in min
ing. California has still the greatest possibilities as a mining State.
There is evidence that our resources in mining have only been
scratched, and that improvement of processes, and, above all, the
use of electric power, may restore to California her supremacy as a
producer.
President Roosevelt has helped the mines of the State greatly
by promoting legislation which releases the use of hydraulic power
in the mountain streams, that it may be used in developing electric
â¢energy to run mines and railroads into the mining regions. Here
tofore, since the forest reservations were made, necessitating the
use of coal for steam power, entire mining districts were put out of
commission for lack of power. It is probable that very soon there
will be life in the old camps of Mariposa County from Hornitos to
Hite's Cove, and that the new energy will be felt all over the State.
There is sense and sentiment in holding the meetings of the
Miners' Association on the field of actual operations. They will be
reunions of old mining cronies, the occasion of swapping stories
about Peg Leg Smith and the lost prospects of amazing richness,
and, mingled with the social pleasures, the business will take on a
..practical tone, not possible when the meeting is held in this city.
; The meeting in Nevada County next month will be largely at
tended, and Grass Valley and Nevada City will give a real Highland
'welcome to the honest miners.
Senator Dcpew says it is not wise for corporations to contribute funds
to political campaigns; indeed, it's quite otherwise if it gets found but.â

THEY'VE GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM
BUTTINSKY.
The new Webster's International Dic
tionary contains 25,000 words which have
not been printed in any previous dic
tionary. But one word which deserves a
place in any English dictionary was
omitted. That word is buttinsky, says
the Columbia Herald. It is slang, but it
is a word which has earned a respected
place in the language. It has no syn
onym of half its force. No other word
can take its place.
A buttinsky is a man whose own busi
ness is of such small importance that
he amuses himself by assisting in the
affairs of others. He is full of sug
gestions, wise counsel, advice. He is full
of self-confidence. He knows how to
build the Panama Canal and would do it
if given half a chance.
But he. is harmless if properly watched.
At the worst he is merely annoying. His
suggestions are impertinent and the at
tention he attracts is of the same sort
as that attracted by a meddlesome mos
quito.
THE NEW REGIME.
Doctor : Lubbig had on,â and
many of his patients wereV employing
Elector Pond. A little girl who had a
good many brothers and sisters, proudly
announced to a neighbor:
"We have a new baby at our house."
"A new baby!"- said the neighbor.
"Where did you get it?"
"Well, we used to take from Doctor
Lubbig; now we take from Doctor Pond."

TEACH YOURSELF TO STAND ALONE
Angela Morgan
I AM asked If I believe it true that "he
Is greatest who most stands alone."
If by standing alone is meant being
able to command the forces within
oneself to meet the problems, sorrows
and difficulties of life, I certainly believe
the statement true.
We do not know anything about our
own resources until we have taught our
selves to stand alone. Not until we can
think for ourselves, decide for ourselves,
and act for ourselves do we become more
than infants in the mpral universe.
We must learn how to suffer alone; we
must learn how to conquer alone; we must
really learn how to HverriO.^a sense
alone, if we would develop into grown
men and women.
The more completely we do stand alone
and the less we depend upon external
aids the more conscious do we become of
help within ourselves. , ["' ." ; ' \u25a0--
Further, than this, if we will persist
ently seek in ourselves the strength; the
comfort, the health . and the happiness
we are tempted to seek without, we shall
discover within us regions of power and
beauty such as we never dreamed ex
isted.
For I believe it true that all of us have
resources we do not suspect; ..that there
are unexplored continents within .us
awaiting development. We have been so
accustomed to .looking without that we
have neglected to look within and have
been in ignorance of our hidden powers.
Sometimes, when grief has goaded us
and pain or heartache urged us, we have
caught glimpses of these unguessed re
gions; but rarely have we had the cour
age to explore them.
Philosophers and poets, in all ages have
sought to impress upon us the truth that
in ourselves are the elements of strength,
beauty, happiness, for whioh we are ever
searching without. And these seers have
shown us that in the end it is to this hid
den source within we must all come for
the good we crave. .
"If thou wouldst have aught of good,
have it from thyself," said Eplctetus.
"It is only as a man puts off- all for
eign support and stands alone that I see
him to be strong and to prevail," de
clared Emerson! ' ' ' -
And Browning says: t :
"There is .an inmost center in us all \
Where truth abides in fullness, and
around, v
Wall upon wall, the gross flesh hems it in.
This perfect, clear perception, which is
truth.
A baflling and perverting carnal mesh \
Blinds it and makes all error; and 'to
know
Rather consists in opening out a way
Whence the imprisoned splendor may es
cape
Than in effecting entry for a light
Supposed. to be without."
There comes a time in every man's life
when he finds lie must stand stripped of
all aid from without. When he must face
some great sorrow, some terrible problem,
or some dread crisis and meet it with sin
gle strength. At such a time he. is com
pelled either to discover himself or fail
utterly. If he is brave he will go within
himself; will find his hidden center; will
explore the unsuspected continents and
become king of a new empire.
None of us can boast that he is entirely
independent of the people and the condi
tions about him for help and encourage
ment. We all depend in a sense upon the
books we xead, the minds we encounter,
the' scenes that meet our eye, for much
of the happiness and inspiration we find in
life. '
Yet all these external influences are
mere agencies in helping. us discover our
selves. â¢ *
Gd to your, friend for sympathy; that is
natural. Go to your books for comfort,
for counsel But the time will come when
no book, no friend,, can decide your prob
lem for you; when nothing can help you,
nothing can save you, but yourself.
Begin now to stand alone.
WALKING A LOST ART.
The elevator and .the' street car are
doing damage to man's anatomy. Every
elevator boy can tell of instances where,
a man will push the electric button till
it rings like a general fire alarm, call the
elevator from the basement, get in at .the
seventh floor and as the car begins to drop
shout- "sixth l" There; are busy men who
will wait ten minutes for' a street car
to' ride one block. As for long walks in
the country and I the exploration of fields
and : woods, : why, perish the pernicious
thought! On Sunday, after a week cooped
up lni the office or the shop, a man -must
spend ; his week's earnings J for a buggy
or an 'auto. Even the tramp would rath
er steal a ride, on the truck of a freight
car, than ;'i be true :to his name. People
ought to walk, more for recreation. It Is
a. fine way of ". seeing the , near-by coun
try. It " ; is exercise ; that gives strength
to the body and the brain.â Washington

FABLE OP THE LITTLE BOY.
Once there was a Little Boy. who
was observed loitering about a pantry
in which was a choice and succulent
gooseberry pie. Soon the Little Boy
departed from the pantry and it was
noticed that the gooseberry pie de
parted about the same time; so his
mamma called the Little Boy to her
and instituted an official investigation.
"Willie," she said, "did you steal the
gooseberry pie"
"No, mamma," was the response of
the innocent little lad, "I did not
steal it."
"But you were in the pantry, and the
pie was there; then you were gone
and so was the pie, andâ"
"I admit, mamma," the Little Boy In
terrupted, "that I took the pie. but In
deed I did not steal it." â¢
"What did you do, then?" his mamma
inquired.
"I only grafted it."
Now It so happened that the Little Boy's
mamma had watched the Dear People
and consequently knew what not to do
in such cases; so she did not Imme
diately elect him to office, but instead
she went into the yard and cut a large.
stingful and effective switch, with
\u25a0which she argued with the j innocent
little lad concerning the error ' of his
ways.
"Now," she said, after she had argued
until her arm ached 'and the Little Boy
looked more or less like some interest
ing: ; and rare red-striped tiger in a
zoo-t-"now are^you sorry?"
"You bet I am, mamma," was the
dear child's feeling response, as he
rubbed the beautiful red stripes.
But after the Little Boy was safely
out of doors his Sweet "Sister said to
him:
"You know very well that you were
not a bit sorry for^what you did."
"I didn't say I was," responded the
Little Boy, "but I was mighty sorry for
what mamma did."

EMMA EAMES
CHARMS CROWD
AT ALHAMBRA
A brilliant crowd came to greet
Emma Eames last night at the Alham
bra, when, with her goodly company,
she gave the first of her two concerts
of the week. It was as large a crowd
its it was brilliant, and as musical as
it was well dressed, for among the
sheerly beautiful memories of grand
opera Eames in "Le Xozze.di Figaro,"
In "Aida," stands with the brightest.
The disappointment felt at her opening
Mozart aria was only flattering 1 . Curi
ous, but Eames paid San Francisco the
compliment of being nervous. She was
distinctly nervous, feeling her way fn
the "Cosi. fan tutti" aria. She seemed
doubtful of the hall, ill at ease with
her audience." The exquisite purity
and simplicity that marked her Mozart
of three years ago was not there. But
encored, Madame Eames warmed to the
"II Bacio," later to come to-â in the
Tosti "Good-by," with the Browning
"God's in his heaven, all's right with
the world." a triumphant dramatic lift
that set the audience shouting. Both
encores these, to a group of lieder,
Strauss. Brahms and Henschel, the lat
ter with the "Spring Song." Here it
was that Eames began to sing like the
Eames of lovely memory, and here It
was that the house began to shout. But
she was heard at her best only in this
last. One therefore awaits Saturday's
concert with Impatience, with Its ex
cerpts from "La Tosca,' its Massenet
and Bach arias and a new group of
songs that will be substituted for the
programmed colsing duet with Slgnor
Crogorza.
In Gogorza Eames has a delightful
assistant. He is artist, poet to his
finger tips, admirable alike in English

Its Witnesses Figured
In the hearing of the suit of the
Spring Valley Water Company against
the city to enjoin the collection Of wa
ter rates under the schedule of 1903,
City Attorney Percy V. Long and En
gineer Expert John H. Dockweiler in
troduced their first witnesses for the
defendant. They were Robert Higgins
and J. S. Emery,, contractors who had
built some of the Spring Valley tunnels
and dams under contract and could
testify absolutely as to what the work
had cost. Experts for the water com
pany had testified merely as to their
estimates of the cost, not as to the ac
tual cost. Mr. Lfong contrasted these
estimates with the actual contract
prices and showed large differences as
follows:
Spring Valley expertsâ Number of brick laid
per diem by one man, 400; Contractor Hig
gins' estimate, from 1000-to 15Â»>0 brick per
day. Higgins testified that the total cost of
the bricking and labor on the Bald Hill tunnel
was 534 per thousand brick, as against $50,
the water experts' estimate. 'Cost of labor
on Pllarcltos tunnel No. 1, per estimate.
?31 70 per thousand brick: per Higgins' con
tract price, $24. Estimated cost of brick work
on Locks Creek tunnel. |3l 70 per thousand;
contract price $16. Estimate of total cost of
bricking that tunnel (labor and material), $66
per thousand brick: actual contract price, $43.
Unl\ - ersity Mound tunnel, estimated cost of
bricking, $57 per thousand; contract price, $30
per thousand. Estimated cost of drifting that
tunnel, $12,100; contract price paid. $10,591.
The cost of drifting and bricking the Crystal
Springs tunnel was estimated by Higgins at
$44,727; by the water company's experts at
?57.000.
J. S. Emery testified that he built
the Pilarcitos dam at the contract
price of 36 % cents per cubic yard. The
water company's estimate was 70 cents
per cubic yard and they swore that the
important part of the work was done
by expert white labor. Mr. Emery
swore that the work was done by Chi
nese labor at $1 per diem, the coolies
boarding themselves.
The examination will be resumed be

KAUFMANN'S FRIENDS SAY
HE WILL PUT O'BRIEN OUT
Bettors Willing to Wager 10 |o}6 on
Big Fellow's Chances.
A1EN MUST GO ALL THE .TIME
California may srlve to the world an
other heavyweight champion to-night.
The wisÂ» mencf pusrdom pick Al Kauf
mann to brinsf over a haymaker on the
jaw of Philadelphia Jack O'Brien at
Wooduard'e Pavilion, and if the youngster
does he will be In line to take up the
burden which Jim Jeffries was forced to
cast aside for want of a suitable op
ponent.
If the pride of the Olympic Club wins
he will be the pugilistic star of the coun
try. The eyes of the sporting; world are
at present focused .on the husky black
smith who has yet to find a man able to
stay longer than a round with him. He
has the punch and the disposition, and
his admirers are willing to risk ten
against cix that these two requisites will
win over the ring: generalship and clever
ness of one of the foremost boxers in the
world to-day.
If Kaufmann keeps his head when
O'Brien dances around, and' shoots those
tantalizing: lefts into hJs face, his chances
are bright. If, on the other hand, he
takes an axial trip bis doom is settled,
for the clever Pblladelphian will surely
bide his time and quickly settle the as
pirations of the local giant.
The betting is 6urely false, for the
youngster has no license to prevail a 10 to
6 cnance over the veteran of so many bat
tles. But the eports. about town think
that the walTop which Kaufmann can
deal "Ut of his right mitt will take ail
the fight out of O'Brien If it lands once,
find they all seem \u25a0 confident that Al is
capable of bringing It over before the
twenty-round limit is reached.
Straight Marquis of Queensberry rules,
which permit ,of fighting at all times
and cautions the pugilists to protect
themselves in the clinches* and the break
aways, will govern the contest. Tins style
of boxing is most popular with the pat
rons of the fighting game, for the reason
that there is more real fighting than in
the clean break fights. Both Kaufmann
and O'Brien preferred this kind of going,
and an exciting mill, ending with a
knockout, is almost. a certainty.
O'Brien proved himself an exception to
â¢he rule common among pugilists by
liot making yesterday a holiday. A
lighter usually- rests the day before a
light, but not so with the Philadelphian.
He took his regular seven-mile run "in
the morning, and with the exception of
cutting out the boxing, his programme of
gymnasium stunts was unchanged. He
worked just as earnestly yesterday as he
did when he first ftaried his training,
ana never was he in better condition. He
did not appear to be the least bit worried
;Â±buur the outcome of to-night's en
counter, and he is awaiting the starting
pong with a calmness only to be seen In
a. hero of more than two hundred ring
tngagements. O'Brien Is so well pleased
with himself that he could not resist
placing a little bet that he would win.
Chapman de Wolff, who came '.all the
way from Philadelphia 10 see Jack fight,
also sent in $200 to be wagered on the
Quaker. : '- 1 .. .'\u25a0-
Billy Delan'ey had Kaufmann doing
light work yesterday afternoon. There
was no hard road yrcrk, only a iew short
sprints. During the afternoon there were
a few short sessions of shadow boxing
and rope skipping, but at 4 o'clock Al's
work was done and he was ready for to
night's struggle. The boy's condition la
perfect. '. -> ""\u25a0'\u25a0

NEW CHAMPION MAY BE MADE TO-NIGHT
SHEPARD GIVEN
HEAVY SENTENCE
Yanderbilt's Grandson Is Or
dered Fined and Imprison
ed by French Magistrate
PARIS, Oct. 26. â The ninth correc
tional tribunal of the Seine to-day sen
tenced Elliott Fitch Shepard, son of the
late Colonel Elliott F. Shepard of New
York, and a grandson of the late W. H.
Vanderbilt, to three months' imprison
ment and Jl2a fine and to ' pay $4000
damages to the parents of Madeline
Mardul. who was killed by Shepard'a
automobile at St. Oven, April 24. The
imprisonment part of the sentence will
not be carried out while awaiting the
future course of procedure on the part
of Shepard, who was present in court.
Friends of Shepard said later that
he intended to appeal from the fine and
Imprisonment part of the sentence, but
that the company insuring the auto
mobile would not appeal from the
award of $-1000 damages to the parents.
The appeal will postpone the imprison
ment until a final decision is given.
Shepard says he deeply. regrets the af
fair, but- feels, that the prosecution as
sumed undue proportions owing to the
recent popular agitation against fast
automobiling.
Maltre Perncare, counsel for the
prosecution, emphasized the need of
making an example of Shepard, declar
ing that American millionaires had the
habit of coming to France and running
over peasants like chickens. Â»,*;-\u25a0.;

Only two of the seven bouts for the
Coast amateur championships went the
limit last night at the Olympic Club.
Hard fighting marked all. the contests and
there was hardly a moment of slow mill
ing during the evening. George Murray,
unattached, and James McClair of the
Olympic Club, middleweights, fought
three hard rounds. Several times during
the contest both men were on the verge
of going out, but they came back quickly
and at the sound of the gong in the third
round both were battling desperately.
Murray was given the decision and
trophy. A medal 'was given McClair. for
his good showing. \u25a0 /" â¢ '
It took Frank Flores, an Olympic Club
lightweight, less than a round to finish
his argument with T. Kerwin. Ajright
swing via the jaw earned him. the medal.
D. Itiordan, Olympic Club light . heavy
weight, gave A. Snooker a good beating
and Referee Graney saved Snooker from
further punishment by giving Riordan
the verdict in round two.
In the final of the featherweight diviÂ»
ion Harry -Baker of the -Hayes Valley
Club and Mike Kutchos put up a good
go. Baker's cleverness offset Mike's hay
makers, as the former kept continually
poking his left into Mike's face. The de

G. K. Earley, a representative of the
Occidental Club, showed to be a good one
by beating his opponent, H. Carr, in the
125 . class. Earley kept jabbing his left
into his opponent's face, which had its
effect. Carr fought all the way, but
Earley seemed to have a better knowl
edge of the game, and when the oppor
tunity presented itself in the second
round he brought one over which sent
Carr to the mat for the count.
Willie Wolff put up an excellent fight
with J. Young in the Welterweight di
vision and stowed him away in two
rounds by the knockout route. -Young
started the bout as if he were going to
beat Wolff quickly, but Willie got in his
stride and fought him to a standstill. ? In
the second, round Wolff's left made fre
quent visits to Young's jaw, and when his
opponent was ripe Wolff sent a right hay
maker to the point, which ended mat
ters.
The heavyweight bout was the only
farce of the evening. W. Schulken
knocked out J. Clasby In a round. Clasby
appeared to know little about the game
and seemed muscle bound. Each of the
winners were awarded trophies in their
respective classes.

- The Seals took another fall out of the
Portland stars at the Eighth street lot
yesterday ! afternoon >. and . their victory
brought them up in second place. They
had a hard time at that in beating the
Giants to the finish by a run, but every
thing .- came out all right, ; for the Seals
profited by Sweeney's bad throws in the
fourth and fifth which gave them enough
to go through with.
Uncle was afraid, that Williams was
not going to weather the storm, so he
stuck Jimmy Whalen In after the sixth
when Williams was bumped for threa
runs. It began to look awful bad for the
Seals then, but Whalen came to the
front Just In time.
Joe Nealon put the first one over for
Uncle in the fourth, when He slapped one
to Sweeney, who heaved the ball into the
bleachers, letting Joe come all the way
around. Williams leaned up against one
for three bags in the next period and
when Sweeney threw Waldron's hit away
the blonde pitcher arrived. Waldron
quickly got away with a steal of second
and third and Hilde put him through
with a nice bunt that went safe.
â¢ The Giants made an awful rally In the
sixth, when they seemed to be able to
hit everything "Williams had. Schlafley
beat out an infield clout, stole and scored
on McHale's blngle. After this both
Sweeney and Cates rapped out doubles,
but the batting f est ceased before the
score was tied up. The score:'

MILK RAID
BY BOARD
A FIASCO
Warning Given Dairymen by
Prosecution of Smart and
Delay by Officials Causes
of the Negative Results
NO DRUGS FOUND
IN SEIZED FLUID
Lacteal Supplies Tapped by
(Citizens Show, the Use of
Hair Bleach as a Preserva
tive of the Cow Product
The' belated action of the Board of
Health in the matter of dairy inspection
has resulted in nothing. Balds made on
the milk dealers after they had days of
warning by reason of the prosecution of
George C. Smart for selling drugged milk
were only a flash in the pan. City, Che
mist H. G. D. Gibbs' report, filed yester
day, on the 163 samples of milk 'seized
early this week by the inspectors dis
closes that the dairymen, with ample, no
tice, had protected themselves.
Not a single case of formaldehyde, coal
tar or other poisonous adulterant was
brought to light. Out of the entire batch
the worst that could be found was tjie
presence of large quantities of bacilli,
some pus, and in a number of Instances
a low percentage of butter fats.
In contradistinction to these results
from Board of Health Inspectors'- collec
tions are the discoveries made in milk
samples submitted by citizens. These
samples were sent to the board by dairy
patrons who had made.no trumpeting of
their intentions, but had quietly prflpured
the milk and cream samples from vari
ous sources of supply. Chemist Glbbs
in submitting his report on such samples
disclaims all reponsibllity for them.
Health Officer Ragan goes further and
demands that any prosecutions based on
the reports must be inaugurated by the
persons who furnished the ' milk for
tests. .
FINDS NEW DRUG IX MILK.
Hydrogen peroxide, used as a medical
antiseptic and also is commonly utilized
for hair bleaching purposes, is the latest
poison to find a place in the up-to-date
San Francisco dairyman's laboratory ad
junct to his milking department. In ' a
sample of milk from the Green Valley
Dairy, submitted by Mrs.- J. Tomalty of
702 Natoma street, the chemical test re
vealed hydrogen peroxide. The drug is
used to prevent fermentation. Mrs. D.
B. Green of 1616 Hyde street furnished
milk from Shafer & Green, which tested
only 2.0 per cent butter fats, or U per
cent' below standard.' The same low per
centage was found in a sample from the
San Carlos dairy, sent in by M. Roche of
527 Castro street. Dr. H. M. Beck of
305 Sutter street supplied milk from the
Morning' Star Dairy which tested only 2.6
per cent. Cream from the Standard Milk
Company, supplied by W. Turner of IT7
Seventh street, contained borax. Mrs. J.
La Roche of 1634 Webster street turned
in milk from the Oakland Dairy that
tested only 2.2 per cent butter fats. *
Only two arrests were ordered by
Health Officer Ragan of dairymen whose
milk was seized by the inspectors this
week. These are Z. Sham, of 'the Marin
Dairy, whose milk tested only 2.9 per cent
fats, and E. H. Arnold. Arnold's milk
ran 2.4 per cent butter fats. He is in
the Police Court now on a charge of
using a filthy wagon . and with carrying
a can of water in his delivery cart.
So the mountain, labored and 10, a
mouse popped forth.
In Its dilemma the Board of Health
held a special meeting yesterday . morn
ing to attempt to shunt responsibility for
the conditions exposed by the Smart pros
ecution. The board solemnly j resolved
that it needed more money, that without
money nothing could be done. So \u25a0 the
official game of "passing: the buck" was
invoked and a bunch of "whereases" con
cluded with a demand upon the Board of
Supervisors for coin, $3000 being the
amount which the board concluded would
provide for outside inspection and labora
tory examination of milk.
Not forty-eight hours before that the
department officials were explaining that
their Inaction as'to milk was due to elab
orate'inquiries concerning olive oils. Now
a question of emptying mare gold .out of
the d(y treasury is the excuse. The City
Chemist said he had made 932; chemical
analyses of milk samples since July 1.
Health office records show that more than
2.5 per cent of them were made since Eu
gene LÂ«nt, the attorney, opened his cam
paign against poisoned milk not ten days
ago. Chemist Gibbs reported he had found
In the milk examined the following adul
terants: ' One hydrogen peroxide, seven
formaldehyde,', ten borax, nineteen arti
ficially colored, 171 below the 3.4 per cent
and above 3 per cent in butter fats and
hfty-two below 3 per cent. . . :
DEALERS WATER THE MILK.
He was satisfied from his investigations
that the use of poisonous adulterants is
not generally practiced by the milk deal
ers, but the milk supply, Glbbs comments,
is by no means ideal. Gibbs adds:
A oractlc* which is quite common among
some of the larie dealers Is that of watering
tho milk. ThiÂ» is â¢ Intellirently carried on
by means of analysis of the milk received from
the country shippers, and the -maximum
amount of water which can be added and still
keÂ«p the milk within thÂ« standard.
Dr. James ..Ward, president of the. Board
of Health, said yesterday that . prosecu
tions of dairymen whose milk shows ba
cilli cannot be prosecuted.' He asserted
there was no law'^under which' they could
be reached. - :\u25a0\u25a0/\u25a0\u25a0 .
Dr. A.' A. d'Ancona of the health com
mittee oÂ£ the Board \of Supervisors ob
jects to the implied criticism of the board
contained in the resolution adopted yes
terday by the Board of Health. .: He said:
The Board of Health last year declared that
the appropriation lor food investigation. In
cluding of course milk, should provide for
laboratorlcal work, 'rather than for direct ex
amination of food by outsMe inspection. .In
accordance with that view the Supervisors al
lotted $12,000, representing i eight Inspectors"
pay tnr a year, and that money was j used. I
presume, for laboratory work. The same . ac
tion was taken this year, ample funds for the
chemlcar analysis -belns' set aside. Besides
this there are three dairy inspectors In addi
tion to' other 'inspectors; for food products. I
am satisfied funds; are sufficient for proper
conduct of thu dairy- work. ;\u25a0 ..',,'.

FIRES BULLET
TO STOP THIEF
Detective Armstrong Chases
Man Who Purloined toti-
Jiefl Check From Marine
PROVES GOOD SPKINTEB
Others Join in Pursuit, Using
Horse and Wagon, but the
fugitive Makes His Escape
Thomas-McCarthy, -a marine from
Mare Island, * reported' to the . police
about 6 o'clock yesterday morning that
he had been robbed of a certified check
for $440 ,on the Wells-Fargo Nevada
National Bank. He said he had been
drinking with a man who took him to
the "Winchester Hotel and stole the
check . from, his pocket while he was
asleep. He gave" a description of the
man.
Detective Armstrong, who happened
to be on duty in the Hall of Justice,
went with McCarthy to look for the
thief. As they passed a pawnshop on
Montgomery avenue, a man ran out
and , -McCarthy . instantly recognized
him as the stranger 'Who had taken
him to the Winchester Hotel. Arm
strong and .McCarthy gave chase and
Armstrong called upon the fugitive to
stop or he would shoot. No attention
was paid to the threat and Armstrong
pulled out his revolver and fired three
shots in the air, but that had no effect.
Policeman Engel, who was in the
branch postoflice on Jackson street,
between. ' Montgomery and Sansome,
heard the shots and ran out. He Joined
in the chase, but " the fugitive had
proved himself such a good sprinter
that there seemed little chance of over
taking him. Sergeant S. Campbell was
in' toe neighborhood and he and Arm
strong jumped into a wagon and
whipped up the horse, -but they lost
sight of their man on Broadway, near
the v/ater front. \u25a0-' ' . . '
Payment of the certified check has
been stopped at the bank and descrip
tions of the thief have been sent to all
the outside stations, r
Linehan, charged with using coal tar dyes
in cream and milky were " continued yes
terday in Judge Cabaniss' court until
Saturday.
AFTER 3IILK DEALERS.
Sausalito Board of Health 'Will Prevent
â¢ Us* ot Drogs.
SAUSAL.ITO, Oct. 26.â The Board of
Health of Sausalito to-day commenced
a rigid and thorough inspection of milk
sold here and also of milk shipped 'to
San Francisco.- Milk shippers and
dealers having: adulterated milk in
their possession will be dealt with In
the courts. Owing; to the numerous
complaints of impure milk being: fur
nished to families, the board at a re
cent meeting determined to take active
steps 'to prevent the use here of adul
terated and impoverished milk. ' They
are now taking: samples out of the
milk cans and will have it analyzed. If
any milk examined fails to pass the re
quired test and shows presence of for
malin or any other deadly \u25a0 preserva
tive, the guilty, person wJU-.be charged
with selling adulterated milk and vig
orously prosecuted in the courts by the
board. : ' ' ' . . ..
Several of~"the dealers were- 'cau
tioned some time ago about using pre
servatives in their milk and selling
milk from sick cows. A large' pdrtton
of San Francisco's supply comes from
this county. ''..]'."' '." ".

DECIDES RIGHT
OF EXECUTORS
Appellate Court Gives Opin
ion That Upholds Employ
ment of Separate Counsel
GAETLAND GAINS FEE
Sustains Judge Coffey, Who
Granted an Allowance to
31inority 31an's Attorney
The First District . Court of Appeal
has decided that where there are two or
more executors of an estate each executor
is entitled, to an attorney of his selec
tion and that a reasonable allowance for
fees la chargeable to the estate. In the
earns opinion the right of an executor
who might be in a minority of three or
more to engage his own counsel is
held. 1
The decision results from an appeal
taken by two of the three executors of
the estate of Angella R. Scott from a
â¢lecree made by Superior Judge Coffey' in
connection with- the settlement of the
executors' accounts'. Under order
$5000, allowed for attorneys' fees, was paid
by two of ' the executors, Frank Garcia
and C. M. Gerrlsh, to their attorneys,
Philip G. Galpln and A. K. ; Bolton, noth
ing being allowed to John B. Gartland, at
torney for C. S. Tilton. the third executor.
Prior to this, $250 had been paid to Gart
land, and Judge Colfey ordered an addi
tional $750 allowance to him. Garcia and
Gerrish appealed.
In the opinion the court recites that
section 1355. Code of Civil Procedure, does
not mean that the act of the majority
can deprive one of the executors or ad
ministrators of the assistance and. advice/
of counsel Heretofore the practice of
permitting executors to- retain independ
ent counsel has been one of professional v
ethics. The decision establishes the prac
tice as one of right and a matter of law.

National Board of Under
writers Issues Exhaustive
Report on San Francisco
UEGES BIPROVEMENTS
Says City Has Violated All
of the Traditions of Busi
ness by Not Burning Up
"San Francisco has violated all under
writing traditions and precedent by not
burning: up. That it has not done so is
largely due to the vigilance of the fire
department, which cannot be relied upon
indeflnitely to stave off the inevitably."
Such is the opinion of the National
Board of Fire Underwriters as expressed
in an extensive report on fire hazard con
ditions In this city, i The report is the
result of three months of investigation,
made by a corps of engineers, under di
rection of a committee of twenty. This
committee has been charged with the duty
of supervising such inquiries throughout
the United States in the hope of improv
ing the fire risk . situation. This work
results from the Baltimore conflagration.
In the summary of the report, which Is
In much detail and volume, the nre-flght
lng facilities are handled under five
heads, the water supply taking prece
dence. The committee gives many paces
to a study of this subject and reports
that the Spring Valley water/ works is
efficiently managed, but lack of satis
factory agreement and pending litigation
react unfavorably on the quality of lire
protection rendered. The supply is
ample for present needs, but additional
conduit capacity is necessary to avoid
possible shortage in the near future. The
large proportion of distributing malns>
are too small, particularly In congested
and other, mercantile and manufactur
ing sections. Many occupied streets are
without mains. There are too few gate
valves for efficient control. The hydrants
are well Bpaced but of unsatisfactory
typea.
CO3IMENTS OJT "WATER SUPPLY.
The fire department is credited with be
ing well organized and under an. able
chief, but the equipment Is reported as
only fair. The general comment on wa
ter supply and fire \u25a0 department Is:
Water Kupply ample In quantity for present
demands, but decided probability of local fail
ure In . emerxency due to faulty distribution
system, which la particularly bad in outlying
aectlons_Fire Department efttcient and In gen
eral adequate. Fire alarm Â«ystem fairly ex
tensive, but only moderately reliable.
Touching buildings and hazards the re
port recites that the building laws are
fairly satisfactory "but are poorly . en
forced. The potential hazard is very se
vere and the probability feature Is alarm
ingly-severe, say the engineers.
Many recommendations along engineer
ing lines are offered for the Improve
ment of the water . supply and service.
The chief is that the proposed separate
fire main system be installed at the
earliest possible date. It Is urged that
immediate steps be taken by the com
pany to increase the capacity of the Ala
meda conduit, with provision for large
storage area for water. Detailed recom
mendation touching construction, size
and new installations -of mains V are
given.- Specifications are furnished for
a separate fire main system for congested
districts. ,
In the matter of fire department equip-^
ment the report suggests"^ large num
ber of items of Improvement, Including
the Installation of a light-draft flreboat.
More ladder companies . are recommended
and that not less than five engine campan
ies respond to first alarms In the congested'
valve district. The board urges that the
building laws be amended along lines of
the code prepared by the National Board
of Underwriters, specially encouraging
the use of modern protective devices.
Other recommendations. are:
That the building laws be rigidly and Im
partially enforced; that the lurce of inspectors
be at leajl doubled at once and thÂ« force bÂ«
put under civil service rules and vested with
full power to enforce the laws; that the fire
limits be extended to the south to provide for
future building growth In this direction.
PROTECTIVE MEASURES.';
As to other protective measures the
report reads:
Explosives and Inflammable*. â That a com
plete code of regulations governing the manu
facturo. sale, storage and transportation of all
explosives and Inflammable substances be
adopttd. It Is suggested that the rules of the
Municipal Explosives Commission of the City*
of New York bo used as a guide In framing
new regulations; that the fire marshal be as
sisted by an inspector whose sole duty shall be
Inspection and control of all places containing
oils, explosives or other Inflammable sub
stances, with full authority to enforce the laws
and regulations; that the "Oil District" be
restricted to a smaller area, the: limits on the
north being withdrawn to Sixteenth street, as
It is at present in too close proximity to the
lumber and manufacturing district
Electricity. â That measures be taken Imme
diately to secure the removal of all - overhead
wire*, excepting: trolley wires. In 'the under
ground dlstrlot; that an ordlnano* be passed
that all overhead wires excepting: trolley wires
be plaoed underground within tha fire limits;
that all old wiring- be relnppec ted and defec
tive installations ba remedied; that no over*
head vrlrts carrying current in excess of ap
proximately 2200 volts be permitted In the
built-up portions of the city; that six elec
trical inspectors be appointed to act under di
rection of the chief of the department of elec
tricity, t
Conflagration hazard. â That prompt . meas
ures be taken to relieve hazardous I conditions
in narrow streets by widening- the streets, , by
enforcing adequate window .. protection, or ' by
oomblnlng both methods; ' that automatic
sprinkler equipments be \u25a0 required In all build
ings which, by. ; reason of their size,' construc
tion or occupancy, singly or combined, . might
act as confla eratlon breeders. '
The engineers who prepared the report
are R. C. Clark, in charge of party and
structural work; A. H. Smith, in charge
of hydraulic work, and jR. C. : Martin, in
charge of fire department. | " The National
Board of Underwriters represents j 120 of
the leading fire , Insurance /companies ' of
,the United States. It has no control over
rates of insurance. The board has four
parties of engineers in the "field on work
similar to that done in, Son Francisco..

Head of King Alfonso's Navy
Is Expected to Retire
From /the Rios Cabinet
MADRID, Oct. 26. â President Lou
bet's visit to Madrid was concluded this
evening .without special/incident. He
was. accompanied to the station by
King Alfonso and left for Lisbon at
6:16 o'clock. He will reach the Portu
guese frontier early to-morrow morn
ing. '. -V" '-. : â¢
The ministerial crisis augments
dally,; owing: to the' peculiar attitude
of the friends of Minister of Marine
Villaneuva, who ; objected to President
Loubet bestowing 1 the -grand cross of
the legion of ..onor on him after con
ferring: a higher order on General 'Wey
ler. the Minister of War.
The attitude of Senor Villaneuva
created a serious incident and is
threatening a disruption of the Cab
inet Villaneuva maintains that, as
supreme head of the navy, he should
not receive lower decoration than the
head of the army. -French circles hold
that Villarieuva's action Js the result
of his unsympathetic sentiments to
ward France and it is said that the
Incident will result in his retirement
from the Cabinet. The Premier is seek
ing to prevent the disruption going
beyond the Minister of Marine, but
other retirements, including that of the
Minister of Finance, are considered to
be imminent. - â¢ â¢>
In Government circles it Is said that
Senor Montero Rlos will not surrender
the Premiership. until after the conclu
sion of the Moroccan conference.
FATHER ARKESTS SON
AND INTENDED WIFE
Wedding Party Is Landed in
Jail With Stolen
Property.
A wedding at the Washington^Dance
Hall was interrupted last night and the
prospective groom, bride and best man
were taken to the City Prison, where
they may remain f,pr some time. Special
Policeman Joe Cuppers was the man who
gave Hymen the solar plexus.
The groom that was to be is Cuppers'
son, Fred, the bride that wasn't is Car
rie Gomez, and the best man, who turns
out the worst of the trio. Is Thomas
Lockyer, *Â«on of Captain Lockyer of the
Vigilant. "
When Fred Cuppers was searched at
the prison a pawn ticket for a $90 watch
that had been stolen from Captain Lock
yer was found in his pocket. It Is j de
clared that young LocKyer. took the
watch to defray expenses of the nuptial
feast. A diamond pin, which had also
been taken from Captain Lockyer, was
found in the possession of the unblush
ing bride that was not.
"The guests were met. the feast was
set" at Washington Dance Hall, when
Special Joe Cuppers arrived. The schoon
ers were frothing at the mouth with the
liquid for a toast. A marriage license
had been secured and somebody was out
hustling for a sky pilot or somebody who
would, splice the nuptial knot.
"This Is my : bride, pa." said young Cup
pers. , -
"Not on your life," shouted the parent."
I've pinched her too many times. I'll not
have May-the-Bullet for a , daughter-in
law If I know it."
So the wedding party was pinched, with
disastrous results.

trade conditions: "It is somewhat difficult

wild excitement of yesterday the market quiet

bearish feeling, as about 1700 gins
failed to report. In addition to thls-the mar

proflu brought more oiTerlngs than could

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Fnture Grain* and Provision*.
CHICAGO, .'Oct. i 26.'â With '. the markets - of
Europe all agitated over the \u25a0 critical '\u25a0 situation
in Russia, : the market for | wheat here "opened
amid marked excitement. â¢ Clamorous \u25a0 covering
by . shorts was simultaneous" with ': a ; big. in
vestment demand. The result-was an unusual
buying demonstration. ; An" advance of ; l<gl >4 c
in the price 'of wheat at '; Liverpool â¢ formed the
immediate - cause of the openlng-.furor.- Offer
ing* at first were . exceedingly meager, j and
consequently initial quotations showed radical
gains, the May option - being' up %c to/l%@
lJic at S9%c to 00>@00%c. December was up
%Â®?ic at BSV4c.to BS%c.;-For a. time trading
was at -almost white heat." Under cover or
the excitement there was heavy selling of _th#
December option by a leading long. THere was
also liberal selling by commission housqa^^n is
the market and caused some reaction in^rices.
arrested temporarily the bullish trend oÂ£
December declining t6 88c. ". The price of the
May delivery, however, did ' not < recede . below
the" lowest price recorded at the opening. Cable
advices from Europe, \u25a0 regarding the situation
In Russia were extremely pessimistic. A dis
patch from Odessa stated that loading of grain
at that port had become exceedingly difficult,
owing to labor disturbances and the market
was greatly excited. This Information started
f rejh buying many of the early sellers being
anxious to reinstate lines. Much - of the later
demand was for the May delivery. '
As a result the premium" for May over De
cember advanced to over 2 cents, as against
l%c yesterday. In addition to the foreign sit
uation the domestic news was also quite
favorable to the bulls. Minneapolis reported
receipts from the country 1 very light. Demand
for Hour -in the Northwest was excellent. .The
close, was strong, wlfh final quotations on 'May
up 2 ! !ic at 91%@01%c. December closed l%c
higher at 89% c. . : _
The corn market was active and strong. De
cember closed %o up at 4696 c. . \u25a0
Sentiment in the oat market was bullish
and the volume of trading was large/ De
cember closed %c up at 30% c. â¢
Provisions were a trifle easier earlier, but a
steadier tone developed later. At the ; close
January pork- was up 2%@5c. Lard showed a
gain of 2%@5c. Ribs were a shade higher.

For tlie past month we, with our designers, have studied on
styles and effects for fall and winter suits, and as a reward
for our efforts have turned out a stunning garment, with
box back effect, which we, as critics on styles, have termed
a "correct garment for winter wear." These suits are built
of Scotch mixtures in all the regular tweed CZi\
and homespun effects. Special \plAarcvfvF
Regular $17.50 value.
The Blouse Suit is a fashion that is a staple, and a style that
is good the year round; not alone is it a winner in this re-
spect, but it is a garment that has the swing- and dash that
most suits lack. Broadcloth, in navy blue, black and cardi-
nal, are the fabrics and shades you have to fi^<TfeÂ£* 4"|A
choose from. Special
Regular $35.00 value.
A three-quarter coat of a tan covert is the garment we are
j making a hurrah on, and a coat that speaks for itself. We
\ are sure you will be astonished at its style and swagger
when you learn the price. Special ..... gÂ£\ f|/\

ACCUSES WEGER
OF THIEVERY
Assemblyman of Ukiah Faces
a Charge of Embezzling
Money of His Employers
Ex-Assemblyman F. M. Weger of
Uklah has been arrested on a charge
of embezzling funds of the A. P. Hotal
lng Company, wholesale liquor deal
ers of this city. Weger is charged with
being short in his accounts as sales
man and collector of the- well known
firm, in whose employ he has been
about a year.
The specific count against the ex-As
semblyman Is the embezzlement of $120
of the firm's money. But, according to
Thomas Kirkpatriok, vice president and
general manager -of trie Hotaling Com
pany, this is not the total amount of
the shortage. Weger's accounts are
being checked to ascertain how he
stands.
Weger's preliminary examination has
been set for November 10 at Santa
Rosa. It was reported last night that
txie alleged defalcation had been set
tled by the ex-Assemblyman's friends
and that there would be no prosecution.
Kirkpatrlck, when seen at his resi
dence, 1013 Steiner street, said:
"I know nothing about any settle
ment. So far as matters stand now,
Weger . will be prosecuted. WÂ« have
not learned the full amount of the
shortage charged against him. Our
books are under examination for that
purpose. Weger was not under bonds.
I do not know what- he did^ with the
money." â
Weger was appointed to handle the
company's business in Sonoma County
and adjoining territory, where he was
well acquainted. His prominence in
politics gave him an inside lead to a
great deal of business and he was
known generally as a good fellow.

captain immediately ran to the Ulejraph and
stopped the engines, but the vessel scraped
bottom a few moments later. The ship then
became unmanageable, the rudder post havlr.Â«
been broken and Jammed Into the wheel, and
drifted upon Guano Rock. A tur was sent for
and towed the steamer to North Bend, where
the cargo was discharged. None of it was
damsred excepting 261 eaoks of wheat, which
were soaked with salt water. The steamer
was lowed to San -Francisco for repairs'.
The testimony of Louis Mataon, the man at
the wheel, and the other officers corroborated
that of the captain. The case was submitted.

"ThÂ» bearer. Mr. J. H. Roth, is en
gaged to enter our employ. Please ac
commodate him with board and lodgr
lngr for one week and charge the- same
to us."
Thus ran the note' presented by a
corpulent, smooth-faced and decently
clad man to Adolph Lacaze, whose hos
telry is at 473 Fourth ; street, and so
favorably impressed, was Monsieur La
caze by the visitor's personality that
without further ado he escorted him to
the best chamber in the honse, request
ed him to make himself thoroughly at
home, notified him of the time : that
meals were spread and left him to his
own resources.
As he returned to his office Monsieur
Lacaze bethought him that he had neg
lected to note the signature of Mr.
Roth's sponsor, so he reopened thÂ« let
ter of introduction and saw that It
was captioned and signed with the title
of a mercantile firm doing business at
a certain number on Fifth street. The
name of the corporation was not fa-
mlliar to him, and to satisfy himself
that It really existed he hied to the
designated number on Fifth street â to
find It occupied by the United .. States
Mint. Then he hastily Inspected the
missive again and discovered that the
words "Fifth street" thereon . printed
were followed by the words "Sacra
mento, Cal."
"Why dfdn't I see that at flrstr
Monsieur Lacaze solused, figuratively
kicking himself, and he enlisted a po
liceman to accompany him back to his
caravansary.
They found Mr. Roth, in neglige of
shirt-sleeves and stocking-feet, reclin
ing In a Morris chair, his pedal ex
tremities resting on. thÂ«' pianoforte and
wreaths of thin blue smoke ascending
from his lips, which daintily, nipped a
brown-paper, cigarette. \u25a0/ - -
"Ah, gents,", he languidly drawled,
"welcome f me boudolre.-. T' wat am
I Indebted fr dÂ« honor lv dis/vislt?"
In a pocket of*hls"coatwas. dlscov- :
ered a pad of letterheads similar to the
one on .which was-.written theYmessage
that had -temporarily- deluded Monsieur
Lacaze, and when arrested and. booked
for having:, defrauded an innkeeper he
chuckled and sarcastically asked his
accuser why the charge was 'not that
of forgery.
"It's Jls -'s easy," he declared, "f
convict me lv de. one as \u25a0 de , 'odder, f'r
ye pinched me afore I had time t' de
fraud ye. Wy didn't ye wait till I
chewed yer chuck or pounded me car
on yer bed?" .
Then he considerately -Informed the
policeman that it would be .waste of
time to attempt to "cinch" him on a
charge of forgery, because the letter
heads and signature he had utilized
were those of a firm now defunct
"You're a smooth operator," said Po
lice Judge Fritz to Mr. Roth, "but
you'll trifle with the law until it trips
you up. The worst I can give you Is
twenty-four hours."
"Do I get baok me letterheads?" Mr.
Roth Inquired; and the court replied
that it supposed so.
Among the nomadic vagabonds who
recently arrived from the country was
Harry B. Smith. His Impedimenta con
sisted of a mattress and blanket, and
when he took up winter quarters in the
basement of a tenanted mansion at
O'Farrell street and Van- Ness avenue,
without having- asked for any one's
permission bo to do, he spread his
couch In a corner, constructed some
shelving, drove a few nails In the wall
to serve aa a clothes ; rack and then
settled down to the lightest kind of
housekeeping. There he was discov
ered and arrested by Patrolman Cleaver,
who booked him ; for vagrancy. '
"I suppose," said Judge Mogan to
Mr. Smith, "that to send you- to jail
would be In; accordance with- your, de
sire to be cared for In Idleness, but the
desire of the taxpayers to 'be \u25a0 relieved
from maintaining able-bodied pauper
ism must also' be consideredâ indeed is
paramount to yoursâ and for that rea
son I will give you twenty-four hours
within which to pack up : your house
hold gods and resume .your aimless
Journey, 'if " you are : brought before
me again this winter I shall sentence
you to toll on the rock. pile." 4

When th* clerk. of Judge <Mogan's court
summoned Solomon -Schiff to .receive
sentence for having' battered Mrs/ Mm-_
nic- Jacobs -of ; 1119 \b" Harrison '.'. street/
the | prosecutrix/ rose |to a', question ,*of

a moment l had passed -the bench s re
gretted^': its courtesy, .for :' the v-'lady
launokod a torr*atiaJ stream of crlmi-
nation against the * defendant ' that
would not be stayed.
Her generous physical proportions
completely filled the witness chair and
as she hurled accusation after accusa
tion against 'Mr. Schiff, who cowered
before the oral hurricane, she em
phasized her arraignment by thumping
the Judge's left knee with a chubby
fist. As she drove home each charge
she glared at Mr. Schiff and asked him
If It was not true, and when he falter
ingly endeavored to respond, she fierce
ly commanded him to "shut up," as she
did not propose to sit there and be
abused to her face and in the. presence
of many witnesses by any such, etc.
Among the atrocities which Mrs. Ja
cobs alleged Mr. Schiff had committed
were (1) the starving of his family,
(2) the abandonment of his better, half
while she was afflicted with stomachic
cramps, superinduced by lack of proper
nourishment, (8) the failure to provide
his children with proper clothing, (4)
the beating of a crippled milkman who
sought to collect a bill, (5) the scroog
lng and skimping of , every dollar he
earned' ln order to swell his Jmnk ac
count, now popularly believed to exceed
$5000 in amount. She challenged Mr.
Schiff to disprove any or all of the
foregoing counts and then prevented
him doing so.
"Good Justice and honorable gentlemen
of the Jury," she said to his Honor, who
tat In -semi-petrifaction, "punish him
much, and after you get through with
him I -will persecute htm for infamy. I
will show him that he is not now in Rus
sia, but living In this blessett, intelligent
land." %. \u25a0 *.
Acting in accordance with Mrs. Jacobs'
suggestion, the Judge postponed, sentenc
ing Mr. Schiff until next Monday, when
she will introduce the defendant's wife,
Mrs. Stein, Mr. Snyder and Secretary
White of tjie C. S. P. C. C. to corroborate
every word of her denunciatory \u25a0â¢ ha
rangue. . .
Mr. SchlfT. who is a tailor and dwells
at 1120 Mission streetâ not Howard, street,
as he represented to the courtâ avers
that he battered Mrs. Jacobs because she
visited his house and kept his wife from
attending to her work. Mrs. Jacobs
swears that the object of her several
visits to the Schiff residence was to col
lect moneys due her from. Mrs. Schiff and
which Mr. Schiff resolutely declined
to pay.

Charles Harrington complains that
Maggie Holland conveyed to him gteat
annoyance and embarrassment by accost
ing him while he conversed with ladles
on the street, accusing him of the pa
ternity of her babe in arms and request
ing him to" there and then contribute to
its maintenance. Claiming that he is in
no wise responsible for the infant's sup
port, he prays the law â¢to relieve him
from Miss Holland's unwarranted accusa
tions, which, he alleges, are serving to de
prive him of desirable feminine friend
ships. Judge Mogan continued the case
until Mr. Harrington has formally sworn
to a complaint charging Miss Holland
with having disturbed his peace.
Judge Fritz deferred till November 11
the handing down of his decision in the
caae of W.F. Hopkins, , accused of having
assaulted with intent to murder James
McGlnley by stabbing him with a knife.
The defense was not-represented in oourt

case. . \:
Mrs. Annie Hoffman, accused of having
battered Mrs. Sadie Brown in j the latter
