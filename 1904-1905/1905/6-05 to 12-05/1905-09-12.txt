BLINDNESS
THREATENS
HILGARD
Noted Savant May
Lose Use of
His Eyes.
Berkeley Professor Is
Obliged to Suspend
Work on Book.
Fruits of a Half Century's
Study May Be Lost Be
cause of Affliction.
BERKELEY. Sept 9.â The lons-cher
ished dreams of Professor E. W. Hilgard.
*ho planned to bring his great work of
thirty-one years as a soil expert at the
University of California to its crowning
achievement in the publication of an- ex
haustive work on "Soils," seems likely to
be shattered by a misfortune which was
made public on the campus to-day.
Professor Hilgard is threatened with
blindness and Dr. Loughridge. his" as
sociate for many years m the college of
agriculture, has been called in to assist
him in the mechanical details of the .big
volume on "Soils." Professor Hilgard has
had to cease work on his beloved book,
laying Â«aside the manifold pages of copy
â¢with infinite regret, but with the heroic
resignation that is considered part of the
equipment of a great man and great
savant. . -
The book of Professor Hilgard on
"Soils" was to have been the ripened
fruit of his half-century of study in a
field wherein he is acknowledged to be
pre-eminent master. Students all over
the world, and teachers as well, were in-
JfrrmcA that Professor" \u25a0 Hilgard purposed
rounding out fcis great career at" the uni
versity of California with such a volume,
and its appearance has been awaited over
all the world with uncommon Interest.
To all who mow of the important char
acter of the work and the place it had
m Professor Hilgard's heart the news
that it may not be finished or may be de
layed an indefinite time has come as
tidings of especial sadness.
While Dr. Loughridge, himself an ex
pert of note in the world of soil problems,
is helping Professor Hilgard in some of the
details of the tabular work on the manu
script. Dr. Hilgard has taken a few' of
Profec*or Loughridge' s classes, this latter
work involving no strain whatever upon
his eves.
This arrangement, will be continued
until it is definitely known whether Pro
fessor Hilgard is to lose the use of his
eyes completely. \u25a0 %
Professor Hilgard was granted a year's
leave of absence by the regents several
months ago. He planned to utilize this
\-acation by completing the work on
â¢\u25a0Soilfc" and placing it on the market at
the end of the year.

BY CRATERS
Three Volcanoes in
Simultaneous

Danger That Lava
Flow May Have De
stroyed Valley.
Missionary Back From. South
Seas Tells of Savaii's
Unhappy Plight.
Among the passengers who arrived here
yesterday on the liner Sierra was J. F.
Brim, a Mormon missionary from Samoa,
who a few days before joining the Sierra
at Tutuila visited the scene of the great/
volcanic eruption on the island of Savaii.
The eruption was still active when he
came away. â¢ The lava, still flowing, had
covered a distance of four miles. Upon
the direction it takes depends the fate
of one of the most fertile valleys on the
island and the welfare of about 400
people. In any event the lava field will
change the southern 'coast line from a flat
stretch of sand to a tumble of barren
boulders. â¢â \u25a0
The eruption occurred in a mountain
behind the district of Matauta. About
3 o'clock a. m. of August 21 the natives
and missionaries for ten miles : around
were awakened by a ', terrific 'booming/
Investigation showed three volcanoes on
the Matauta . slope in full action; The
glare of the fire from the three cones
bathed the sky -for miles : around", a deep i
crimson. Huge. boulders shot hundreds of '
feet t .loto yth^.^lr.-and^cams^iJe'wYf^ilke':'
shooting" stars". "The awflil pyrotechnics';
have continued with varying activity, ever
since, and an .old volcano, twenty, miles
away, has awakened. from a long slumber
and is'once more in. full' eruption.
TERRIFIC EARTHQUAKE. .
The earthquake which preceded the first
eruption shook down many native j huts
and damaged numerous buildings belong
ing to the London Missionary: Society:
Only one death is recorded. . A native
chief, climbing over the hardening lava,
flipped Into a crevasse and before ! he
could climb out a fresh flow, filled the
crack into which he had fallen, burying
the chief and obliterating all trace of his
last resting place.
visited -the scene of the eruption
onfAugust 23. He.got within half a mile
of the .crater. There, is only one cone
visible" now, the places where the natives
say the others were being burled beneath
a mountain; of boulders and lava thrown
â¢Â«jp-'from the main crater.
-.JThe air vibrates with a terrific boom
ing which* ceases whenever the- tide
comes in. As the tide recedes a low mur
mur is heard: which grows in volume the
farther out the tide flows, and at low
tide,, says Brim, the sound is terrifying.
On August 25 the lava', -with its burden
of boulders, had traveled four miles. It
was then six miles from the ocean, but as
the volcano showed no signs of exhaus
tion, it was expected that the flow would
keep on until it reached the sea.
Â«TO\V>* IS MENACED."
The little town of Safotu is menaced by
the flow. There is a possibility of its
turning down another slope, and the
people of Safotu are anxiously waiting to
see what it will do. If it takes the Safotu
route it will wipe out many acres of rich
cocoanut groves, the homes of four hun
dred people and an extensive German
trading station. -
The natives are in a state of panic and
in fear-stricken awe. They spend most
of the nights watching the volcano and
tho days- keeping anxious watch on the
lava flow.
As Brim watched the volcano he says
he saw- it throw out-boulders big as the
Sierra and what appeared to be great
ledges of rock. They . were hurled hun
dreds of feet Into the air, and when (they;
fell they added their barren . bulk to the
desolation so rapidly" spreading over the
face of one of the fairest : lands in -, the
South Seas. Brim leaves to-day for his
home in Albion, ldaho,' v

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 11.â Ex-Senator
E. J. Emmous of Bakerstleld. charged with
bribery, was placed on trial before Judge
E. â¢ C. Hart of the Superior Court at 10
o'clock this morning. Unlike Bunkers,
when he appeared before the bar of the
judgment of his peers, Emmons seemed
to. feel the fullness of the disgrace , that
rests upon him. Throughout the day he
sat in silence, resting his head upon his
hand, seldom glancing at tue veniremen
under examination, seldom noticing his
counsel, and never looking in the direc
tion of his wife and little daugnter, wnu
watched the proceedings with intense In
terest. Ex-Senator Wright, who will be
placed on trial as soon as the Emmons
case is disposed if. was present, looking
pale md worried, but? Frank French dis
creetly remained in the background.
Grove L. Johnson, representing Emmons.
increased the interest by announcing .to
some acquaintances that If the people
I were prepared for sensations they wotild
| not be disappointed, for the defense was
: well ready for the fray.
I "Wo purpose proving," he said, "that
j the . building and loan associations in
volved in this case were guilty of actuat
bribery. We will prove that their conten
tion that they simply laid this trap to rid
the legislative halls of the State of con-,
scienceless boodlers is a snam, and that.
as a matter of fact, they are guilty of
actual bribery and brought ; about the
expose to divert public attention' from the
rottenness of their operations. When we
have concluded our case we are confident
that, the guilty building "and loan business
of California will lie a shattered wreck
and vindication will be ours. .The build-
Ing and loan associations compelled the
Senate to drop the investigation of their
affairs. ;"We will take ; It up" where the
Senate dropped it. We are now In a court
of -justice 'Where the sleek hands of Cor
ruption are impotent." i,
-\u25a0 Interest in the trial was also Increased
through speculation as to the. whereabouts
of Joseph Jordan. District Attorney Sey
mour said: that he had positive assurance
that Jordan would be 'present, : but not
withstanding; his , confidence a few bottles

During tht night, the dispatch t-^yn,
incendiaries tried to land at Bibitbat

volleys from the Cossacks. They then
attacked steamships in which the em

The incendiaries succeeded in setting
fire to three- machine shops in th^.Uolshin
district, killing the proprietor of one..
In the "black town" district the patrol
fired' a volley into a crowd of Russian
workmen, from which a shot was sup
posed to have been fired, but the dis

Throughout the "black town" district the

STEAMSHIP LADEN WITH ARMS.
Revolutionary Vessel Snnk by Her
Crew \Vfaen Detected.
HELSIXGFORS. Finland. Sept. 11â
Customs officials on Saturday discovered
6CO carbines of Swedish make, with bay
onets, and 120,000 cartridges on a barren
Island in the Gulf 'of Bothnia, near
KernL On Sunday morning a boat be
longing to the customs service discov
ered a CM-ton steamship near Kalfskaer
Rock, twenty miles outside of Jakobstad.
The captain and members of the crew,
who spoke in English, declared that the
steamship was fully loaded with rifles
End cartridges, and thereupon- the cus
toms-officials ordered the captain to take
his vessel into port and discharge the
cargo.
The steamship proceeded toward the
phore. the customs boat going in the
meanwhile to a nearby island. Suddenly
several explosions were heard from t3e
steamship anfl the customs officers on
returning round the vessel sinking and
her crew in lifeboats, disappearing hur
riedly toward the south. The officials
immediately pressed into service a num
ber of fishermen, who unloaded most of
the rifles and ammunition on the beach.
The steamship grounded in shoal water.
Her name was painted over, only the
letters "John Bash Fton"- being visible.
American and German flags were found
on board the vessel.
On the ni?ht previous to the discovery
of the rifles and ammunition on . the
island near Kerr.i a fisherman declared
he saw a small steamship cruising In a
curious manner in the offlng.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 12, 3:43.â
The news from Finland of the accidental
discovery of the importation of rifles and
munitions in large quantities is the most
serious disclosure regarding the revolu
tionary movement in Russia that has
yet been made, as it indicates an inten
tion to form a regular military organiza
tion. The Importation of revolvers to
Finland, Poland, the Baltic provinces and
other districts of Russia has been an
open secret for a long time. In fact, the
initiated have found little difficulty in
purchasing repeating pistols of a small
type in St. Petersburg itself, but these
are pocket weapons, intended only for
use in street rioting and in attacks on
the police. The importation of small
caliber repeating rifles and carbines of a
modern type, however, presupposes a de
sign to organize formal resistance to the
troops, and the presence of bayonets In
the consignment strengthens this suppo
sition.
No information can be obtained here
concerning the possible Identity of the
f.llbustertng steamship, which, according
to one dispatch from Helsingfors. is sup
posed to have been cruising under the
American flag, though this probably was
used as a mask.
â¢ It Is considered here that the active
faction of the young Fenoman party of
Finland lc probably Involved In the con
spiracy, and it is recalled that the In
vestigation into the assassination of Gen
eral Bobrlkoff, Governor General of Fin
land, in June of last year disclosed the
existence of a society formed for the
purpose of importing arms.

MEANS MUCH
TO AMERICA
WASHINGTON, Sept. 11.â The State
Department has not yet been informed
officially of the. action of the Russian
Government in revoking the ukase,;..im
posing maximum tariff rates 'on certain
American articles of importation, princi
pally machinery and metal goods.;
American cast and wrought metal work ,
tools, machinery, portable engines, loco
motives and other important staple ex
ports, which were being fairly driven out
of the Russian market by the competition
of German and English machinery
favored by the minimum; tariff. rates, are
now expected to have. an enormous sale,
not only in Russia proper, but; in Siberia*
which will develop rapidly from an agri
cultural point. Qf view as a result of. the
cessation of hostilities. . ,*
It is understood that Secretary ' Shaw
will : recommend to the next Congress
legislation calculated to remove some ol
the severe features of the existing' tariff
laws providing for the imposition . of a
countervailing duty on bounty-aided
sugar, the application of which by. Secre
tary. GageV in^ia&l, caused; the retaliatory
action by', Rusfiiat embodied in the^ukase
directed against American machinery.*;
It . is learned that Switzerland, too,,
which has imposed ' maximum rates*. on
American -products, is about to volutarily
extinguish'them and" allow American ex-"
porters the. benefits of the minimum tariff
rates. .
COLOGNE, Rhenish Prussia, Sept. 11.â .
The Cologne Gazette, In an inspired;
dispatch from Berlin; corrects a' report*
cabled to one of the/; Berlin newspapers 1
from New York f asserting that President"
Roosevelt had written to Baron ' Speok
yon Sternburg, the German Embassador
at Washington, informing : him that. the
concessions offered to the \u25a0 United : States
py Oermany were insufficient "to induce
the United States Government to make a
commercial treaty with Germany, because
th"c United States would be giving up
more than it. would receive. The 'iiper
denies that- any such letter- has been
written or that Germany has already
made specific offers to the Government
at Washington.
The German authorities, the dispatch
goes on to say, are working assiduously
upon the preliminary \u25a0 preparations/. .fcr ;
treaty negotiations. Data regarding the
wishes of Interested . parties are :
collected and commissioners from sov^ral|
of the Imperial Prussian ministries will^
soon begin work In this matter. 1 " The/
authorities will then" decide definitely \u25a0
to whati position they will. take, in the;
forthcoming negotiations. - '
In conclusion the dispatch says: ii
In view of the extraordinary Importance'
which German- American trade relations have:
for the business of the nations- living, on a
friendly footing â¢ with , each other, one may
reckon with confidence upon - auccesa in - the
making of a treaty which will form the basis
of amicable trade relations between : Germany
and the United States for many years.
ANTI-GRAFT CRUSADE

\u25a0 CHICAGO.". Sept.".. 11.â The Rev. John;
Balcom Shaw in his. sermon at the Sec-j
ond Presbyterian Church last night
said in part: .
For year* Use Americas conscience seemed
to be sleeping its last sleep. Graft had flour
ished until we \u25a0 had become a' nation of graft
ers. Corporations hadsrown so lawless â¢ and
merciless as to cease , to be \u25a0 cautious. \u25a0â¢ \u25a0:. . -\u25a0 '
But six months apo; ; with â¢ the ; suddenness j of.
a meteor's flash, ; like â¢ a bolt out ot a clear,
*ky, a new situation ' appeared. . FlrstT came
the cry of "tainted ' money,". : . which was . sa
loud and so widespread as to. warn corrupt and
unscrupulous men, to - arm ' reformers with
weapons they could never /before - carry., and
to push the cause of truth 'and honesty miles'
ahead. Following this f was ; the Eaultable ; ex
pose, which has - dealt - corporation : trickery a'
blow from which it will not soon -recover. *'-?,.
What' all' this promises fonthe work.{>f the

station. the railroad is to be turned over
to the -Japanese, at Kwangr Cheng Tse

.Tnis question is very" important. If
the- transfer .occurs at Kwangr ' Cheng
Tse',' then Russia cedes :to Japan 100
miles of yet unoccupied line and like
wise the only coal mines south of Har
bin. From Chantufu start' all the
trade routes to the very .rich Kirin
province,â and should the road become
the property of the Japanese toKwang
Cheng- Tse the, complete possession; of
Chantufu would place ,: Kirin province
entirely under "Japanese influence. This
would be undesirable for. Russia. Should
the transfer be made at Chantufu or
farther south, Kirin province, which
has supported the Russian "army for

.WOOSTER^ Ohid,\Septl 11.â "I cannot
characterize *, these '\u25a0; charges \u25a0 against â¢ ' Mrs.'
Taggart as 'effrontery-" -They are nothing
but: lnfamous;* dastardly,*- damnable' lies,"
said Attorney Smyser in bis 'comment to

sessions - ; to-day. room was crowded
to the doors t by men and women who had
gathered : r to Smyser's 1 impassioned
plea Jf or Â» hlsTclieht, ? "In -speaking of the
captain teaching his boys to pray he said:
"If Taggart ever -did teach the boys a
prayer it must have. been something like:
"Now I lay me down, to sleep,' l .pray the
Lord; my 'cocktail 'keep; "and Mf M die be
fore I wake, some one my good mint
julep , make.' '.' \u25a0/:', .-Â£ r- '-.'-' *~ '
;He compared Taggart to Dr. Jekyl and
Mr. Hyde and told the story of Christ and
the adulterous woman." He detailed Mrs.
Taggart's stay at "Hurd Hquse," said
she .was there simply while she was wait
ing ' for -a' little house \io be prepared "into
which \u25a0 she * afterward moved, and that
there was nothing : to show that although
Billy.also rcomedin the house, the.rÂ« was
anything ; out"of the wpy. He^arguid the
same way 'in reference to the statements
of neighbors to the effect that â¢ Billy was
often seen at Mrs. Taggart's hou-je in
Orrville.
."Just think of ; thiÂ« : high-bail roller,
this mint julep mixer, -this cocktaU con
coctor. taking , unfermented" grape juice
when he i set up whisky to Billy at the
time he (the. major) arrived In Orrville
with the children. Their talk, about Mrs.
Taggart j making Billy presents 'is the
idlest thrash."
" Then ; on ' the â¢ charge of smoking cigar
ettes against Mrs. Taggart he .said:
!- --"'ineyj have ,* searched " the earth, and
they; have " not produced a single witness

KNOW THE SYMPTOMS
People Suffering From In
nocuous Complaints Are
Sent to Suspect Barracks
. BERLIN. Sept. 11.â An official bulletin
issued to-day says" sixteen cholera cases
and six deaths were reported from n-wn.
September 9, to noon. September 19. and
fifteen Â»as es and six deaths from noon.
September 10, to noon to-day, making:
the totals 170 cases and -fifty-eight deaths.
The symptoms of cholera have become
so 1 well understood throughout Germany
that In numberless cases innocuous com
plaints, such as cramps of the stomach,
are suspected by sufferers to be cholera
and "physicians are summoned in wild
haste. The doctors themselves are fre- .
quently misled and order patients off to
the nearest cholera suspect barracks.
Three such cases were reported in Berlin
to-day and seven at Jagersburg. Experts
from the Infectious disease offices are also
mistaken my their diagnosis, as'thd 'laily
corrections of bulletins state. Only bac
teriological tests fix the presence or Ã¼b
sence of the Asiatic cholera bacillus with
certainty.-
Al though there were thirty-one fresb
cases during the two days ending with
neon that is seven fewer than the pre
eedlng twenty-four hours. This fur
i nlshes continued cause for confidence-at
! the Ministry of Health that the infectmn
is. under control, although a steady flght
will be necessary to keep that control.
The cost of the campaign Is likely to bo
an addition to the Prussian budget. - In
West Prussia, where the cholera has beea
most serious, nearly JlOO.OOO has so far
been spent.

TRAI.V CREW ARRESTED.
The cause -of the accident and the im
mediate responsibility remain to be seen.
The motorman of the wrecked train Is
a fugitive, while a switchman, conductor
and four guards are under arrest.
The switchman is charged with man
slaughter and the trainmen are held as
witnesses. To-night Coroner Scholer,
who has undertaken the work of fixing
the blame for the wreck, announced that
the switchman's bond has been placed
at $5000 and those of the witnesses at
$300 each.
"Whatever may have caused the mis
take, the accident, worst In the
history of the overhead railroads
In New York, came when a south
bound "train 'on the Ninth i Avenue
line was switched off to the Sixth Avenue
line at the Fifty-third Street junction.
The motorman, expecting a clear track on
the direct line of the Ninth Avenue, with
out regarding the warning signal that the
switch was open, rushed his train along
at a high rate of speed. The first car
swung around the right angle curve,
holding the rails because of the weight
of thÂ« train behind. Then the strain be
came too The couplings broke, the
second car was whirled about almost end
for end, and, to the horror of those \u25a0who
locked on from below, pitched Into the
street. N
HURLED THROUGH SPACE.
The first Indication people on the side
walk had -of the "accident was loud rum
bling along the overhead structure. Look
ing up they saw a shower of sparks.
Then followed splinters and the sound of
splitting timbers. Suddenly the outer
guard rail of the railroad structure gave
way, a score of bodies were hurled
through space, and with a deafening
crash the car fell to the street. For an
instant, it stood fairly on end. Then
the sides gave way as if they were made
of pasteboard, bursting out a mass of
humanity. Those passengers who had not
Jumped from platforms and windows be
fore the plunge came were thrown into
a mass at the forward end of the car.
As the injured men and women were
struggling to free themselves two heavy
front trucks of the third car of the train
fell almost in their miast, as the car
Itself jumped partly ofE the elevated
structure and was wedged against a
building at the southeast corner of Ninth

Time, Says Forest Hill Re

Before the World. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND. Sept. 11.â Although years
ago John D. Rockefeller found it im
practicable to speak for publication and
he has adhered strictly to this rule he
bears no personal ill-will toward
newspaper fraternity. He ' tntimated as
much to-day when he admitted your cor
respondent to his Forest Hill home and
talked to him' at length. Indirectly he
said that all who looked for the, truth
concerning him would find It some day. '
"All things come around in time," he
said on this subject. "Time works won
ders."
To-day the oil king's clothing was neat,
of perfect nt and chosen' with excellent
taste. . Withal he was the picture of a
well-groomed old gentleman, '- who \u25a0 was
at peace with the world, who enjoyed life
and who lived for all there was in life.
When told of the pleasure and surprise
expressed by the press humorists who
called on him at Forest Hill last week
and spent an hour in his' company : he
said: .' â¢
"Surprise? You say they were sur
prised? Ah, there is something I cannot
and never could understand."
BELIEVES HE IS MISUNDERSTOOD.
His. hand passed nervously over his
forehead and although .he did not say
so it was evident that he thought of- the
popular Impression of himself, cloistered
in his fortress at Forest Hillâ an impas
sable fortress, beyond the ijates of which
it is supposed none may enter.
"Time will straighten out many of these
things," he saidT after a brief pause. And
then, suddenly referring to the jokers
again:
"Yes, we had a pleasant hour together.
I enjoyed it and hope j they did. . In . re
lation to what Is. referred, to; as my; se
clusion I do not deny, myself to the as^
sociations that . I naturally^ e.njp.y:-' 'Jfg't
I have, been much ",wlth' : "'.t>eople^-lri . facl
almost every day people come to; me. and
it is a bright spot, in the, lives of all 'of
us as we drive or walk about the grounds.
I : have never been a club man, and .have
not frequented places where .people \u25a0 gen
erally go for company. : My, friends dur
ing the hours of recreation , are, many
of them, from my home church." .
.Other, topics came up; but, as if re
ferring to my . remark \u25a0 about newspaper
"knockers," he added to .his "comment
that "time alters : and > adjusts .almost
everything."
"It takes infinite patience and courage
to compel men to have confidence in you.
I believe I have both of these qualities
and 'I also believe that they - are -the
secrets of >my success. I learned to cuK
tlvate both of them when I was 16 years
of age. My 'first real test was- when; I
was making out bills of lading for: canal
and lake boats here in Cleveland. - There
was much to try the patience there and
the \ first opportunity in my life to take
a wrong course, to repel rather than com
pel confidence from my associates and em
ployers- : * â¢ â¢ \u25a0':-â¢ \u25a0
ALWAYS TRIED TO DO RIGHT. :..
"Often a captain' would want me to
put down the wrong - figure.' He would
assure me that it would never 'be known,
that it was ' the ; customary way |of i doing
things and that it was" the right* thing
for me to ! do/ I reasoned- with him: v^'lf
this and this is so, , then Iso and. so is
right.' I Insisted - upon what I thought
was right, bu WJiad j patience , with all who
opposed me. Soon my Employers noticed
my methods of doing business; other em
ployers knew that.l wanted to do the
right thing; j bankers then came to have
confidence in me and success 'followed
step by step." ~ \u25a0'. \u25a0. A \u0084 \u0084 \u25a0.',-:.. ..^: â¢.:'â¢

I closet In the boat house during the
1 night by five youths whose last names
'â¢ she does not know. The officers of the
I Alameda Boating Club have also takea
i the matter up and will make a thor
ough investigation.
Miss Cook is an orphan and has been
s , employed bi v Mrs. J. H. Tingman of
1609 Lafayette street, who is temporari
\u25a0 ly out of town and who before her de-
I parture placed the girl in charge of

TO PAY CLAIM
Three Former Public Works
Comniissioiiers Are Held
Liable .;for Big Damages
HEAVY BUBDEX IMPOSED
Justices of Supreme Court
Hold the Defendants Are
Individually Besponsible
The members cf the Board of Public
Works and their sureties are directly and
personally responsible, -according to a
decision rendered yesterday by the Su
preme Court, for all damages to the
amount of their bonds granted in suits
brought for Injuries caused by defective
ctreets, sewers and other municipal prop
erty under their jurisdiction.
This ruling makes the position of Com
missioner rather precarious from a finan
cial standpoint. The decision will also
cause a great Increase in the cost of the
bonds the officials must furnish. The
opinion is signed by a majority of the
court with no fecord of dissent of the
three Justices who did not attach their
names to the document. The case estab
lishes a precedent in California juris
prudence.
The plaintiff was Dorah A. Heath, a
widow residing on Post street, near
Buchanan. One night, more* than two
years ago, while walking along Buchanan
street, between Geary and O'Farrell,
Mrs. Heath accidentally stepped through
a hole in a wooden sidewalk and in fall
ing broke her arm. Several attorneys re
fused to take her case on a percentage
basis because the woman In front of
whose house the accident occurred did not
appear to be financially responsible for
the amount desired as compensation.
Finally Mrs. Heath secured a lawyer who
thought the members of the Board of
Public Works might be made to settle,
and suit was immediately Instituted. In
Judge Kerrigan's court a jury gave the
plaintiff a Verdict for $5000. An appeal
was Immediately taken to the Supreme
Court.
On account of the principle involved the
Commissioners and their sureties made a
stubborn fight, and several of their at
torneys occupy the front rank in the
legal .profession.
The Supreme Court sustains the plain
tiff and Judge Kerrigan's rulings through
out. The Commissioners asserted that,
their jurisdiction extended only" to -the
sidewalk, that p the plaintiff had ucen
guilty of contributor!' negligence, and
that because of the defective notification
to the board of the condition of the walk
the members should be absolved of all
responsibility.
All of these contentions are held to be
Injudiciously taken.
An inspector of the board twice notified
the owners of property abutting on the
sidewalk in question tnat repairs must
be made within five days or nic board
would itself perform the work and charge
up the expense. This showed that the
Commissioners were aware of the danger.
They held that the notice was defective,
and that therefore thejr should be ex
cused from paying the bill if exonerated
on otber grounds. The court ridicules
this position.
The Commissioners held responsible for.
the $5000 are Marsden Manson, Michael
Casey and A. Van der Naillen. Justice
Hensh&w wrote the j opinion and Justices
McKarland. Lortgan and Shaw;; directly
concur. Attorney Carl W. Mueller was the
attorney for Mrs. Heath,
Grand Jury Elects Secretary.
The new Grand Jury met yesterday
afternoon with only two members ab
sent. It was expected that Foreman
Mitchell would announce the commit
tees, but he said the list would not be
ready until the next meeting. Robert
S. Atkins was elected secretary. It
was decided to hold regular meetings
Monday afternoons at 4 o'clock and
the body adjourned until that hour
next Monday.

Some of the Bar Room Battles

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
On the Police Court calendars yes
terday morning were many cases di
rectly traceable to the influence of the
Britt-Nelson prizefight- upori^ the pub
lic temper. The great fistic event and
Its unlooked-for outcome were creative
of barroom debate \u25a0In all parts of thÂ«
city/ and In many instances argument
led to combat Just as fierce as was
waged by . the two lads In the roped
quadrangle at Colma. All of. the im
promptu encounters did not result in
arrest, but the police scooped in enough
of the peace disturbers to make an ex
ceptionally long Monday docket ;for
each of the three Judges. .
Master Willie Wilson (colored) might
not have routed peace from an Afro-
American ball at Bush and Powell
streets Saturday night if ' he had spent
the afternoon elsewhere than among
those who absorbed the bulletined re
ports from the ringside to the newspa
pers, for many persons of good repute
in the community were ready to testify
that he was an industrious and well
behaved boy until he was stirred up
by graphic recountal of the civilized
savagery displayed by Jimmle and Bat
for the delectation of 15,000 esthetic
spectators.
Indeed so highly recommended was
Willie that when he applied to Coroner
Leland for the position of coachman
his services .were Immediately, secured
by that faithful servant of the munici
pality, ;rior was his conduct thereafter
assailable In^ariy respect until he be
came In teresfred : in the Brltt-Xelson af
fair, asasis
Patrolman; O. P. Burge, ' who was
summoned to the dance,-, to suppress
Master : Wilson," informed. Judge Mogan
that in 'all his experience as a peace of
ficer he never experienced more . diffi
culty.ln asserting the authority in him
vested than when he undertook to ar
rest the young disturber. So ferocious
ly was he resisted that the alternative
confronted him of beating his prisoner
to submission or enlisting aid to im
prison him, and he humanely chose the
latter course, which he would not have
done if the, boy had been a man.
. "He's a second Stewart, that's what
he Is," concluded the complainant,'
thereby pronouncing Master Wilson. the
legitimate successor. of a negro black;
guard and bully who was recently done
to death In a brawl on the Barbary
Coast. .
' It was claimed in behalf of -the de
fendant, however, that - he was,
figuratively "j speaking, less black
that he appeared. True, he had
manifested a keen interest in the pugi
listic event that for weeks had engaged
world- wide attention, but truculence
was far removed from his spirit when
he entered the hall in which the. light
fantastic was being: tripped. He had
been advised by his employer, Dr. Le
land, to equip himself . with all avail
able social accomplishments, and It was

SEATTLE. Sept. 11.â It was not until
the seventh inning that the Champions
nantged to make a run to-day. Roscoe
Miller was the thorn in the Tigers' sides.
Xordyke opened the seventh with a three
hagetr and Kagan followed with a single.
Truck was doubled on a fly to Hart a
few moments later, after McLaughlin had
struck out, and the champion hard luck
pitcher of the league had won a game.
The locals did not get any more hits
than the Champions, but they got' them
when they were needed. Passes. by Fitz
gerald also helped in his undoing. Ben
nett had another great day at the bat,
rapping out two hard doubles to right
ncld and a single. His last rap scored
two runs in the eighth inning.
Fitzgerald was given great support or
the score would have been larger against
him- With the bases full and hone out
in the ttfth," Blankenship hit a hard
gTounder to Tommy Sheehan. who choked
Bennett off at the plate and a double
play resulted. "
Jim McDonald was absent again, mak
ing the fifth straight game he has missed,
and Jack Drennan, the old Seattle and
Portland player, who finished out the
teason in the Northwest League as um
pire, officiated and gave satisfaction.

-The day was lovely, the atmosphere be
ing particularly clear and bright. The
event, which is the last of the Del Monte
golf tournament, was much enjoyed. The
whole tournament has been most success
ful, some of the matches having attracted
larger "galleries" than any ever held on
the Del Monte course.
A tournament for golfers who have
never taken part in any competition .was
held yesterday over the short nine-hole
course.. Two prizes were offered by Mr..
King, one for the. lowest score and the
other for the worst card. Miss Jennie
Crocker won the prize for the lowest re
turns with the good score of 54 and little
Miss Oyster captured the other award.
The contest was one of the most amusing
ever seen on a golf course, the partici
pants playing in all sorts of styles, crowd
ing on to the 'lawns" and running into
the couples ahead of them. The specta
tors agreed that nothing quite so funny
had ever been seen on a California links.
When a 'Boston bulldog and a large
bull terrier, owned by: two young ladies
well known In society, engaged ' in a free
fight on the home green, getting such a
grip on each other that it was necessary
to tear them apart by main force, the
spectators began to wonder what was
coming off next. :
Mrs. L- I. Scott and party returned this
morning" to Burlingame in their - auto
mobile and Mrs. H. T. Scott and party
will return . home to-morrow marning.
P. R. Sargood and Mrs. Sargood leave
by train to-morrow fbr San Francisco.
By the end of the week nearly all the
golfers who have participated in the
tournament will have left Del Monte.

- This is a good picture of Mr.' Jacob Bryan.
Mr. Bryan is a pioneer. He has lived In sight
of San Francisco for forty years. For fourteen
years ,. he- was : postmaster rot Oolma. a ' small
place \u25a0 Just outside of San Francisco, which at
the present time is . prominently before- the
public Mr. Bryan is also a Notary Public
and Is well and favorably known in and about
San Francisco;. - Rheumatism haa been about
the limit of Mr. Bryan's physical suffering.
He ' found ' this trouble getting a strong hold
upon him.' however. . and when . the disease be-
gan to locate In the region of the heart he de-
cided ' upon prompt action, and. having heard
of the success |of Electro-Chemistry In curtnir
seemingly .incurable cases of . rheumatism of
all . varieties,; he decided upon this treatment
for himself. -SMMBMm|nMpMHMj[
In speaking of his cure. Mr. Bryan says:
"I did not feel like poisonlnz my system with
strong drugs. - that' seldom cure . rheumatism '
anyway, so I took â¢ the Electro-Chemlo course.
I only took the treatment for about a month,
and at a small cost was thoroughly cured. X
have sent a good many friends to the Institute
for the treatment, and I:â¢ shall, continue to :
recommend it \u25a0to all sufferers. My own cure,
and the cure of friends suffering from different -
ailments, gives me every confidence In Its ef-
ficacy." ' ,'
In the distressing aliments of women, which ,
so frequently send the sufferer to the operating '
table, the curative powers of Electro-Chemistry .
are marvelous. - No woman, no matter what "
hÂ«r trouble may be. should think of" undergo- '
Ing surgical treatment before Investigating
and positively knowing Just \u25a0 what . Elactro- 1
Chemistry is accomplishing In bad female dis-
orders.

THE PRESIDENT'S WORK.
THE United made much' ihoriey "out of the Eastern war,
and will make much more out of the Eastern peace. Japan won
many victories in. war, but the United States, wins a great com
mercial one in the peace. President Roosevelt has achieved the un
precedented victory of entire admission to Russian commerce for his
country. Heretofore, as we have pointed out, our commerce with
Russia has been small. In fact it has-been of less importance to us
than our trade with Japan. : .. > ; :S
Immediately preceding the , meeting^ of the peace , conference
Baron Kaneko.came to this country to negotiate an enlargement ,of
our commercial relations with Japan. He made a comprehensive
study of conditions here. He is making ready for his departure and
declares his mission to have been a success, and expresses^ great con
fidence in the expansion of trade between the two countries, because
of his investigations and because primarily of the Presidents part
in securing peace. This move on the part of Japan' was not unnoticed
in Russia, and the Czar, passing over the Russian Minister at Wash
ington, constituted De Witte a commercial agent through whom to
announce to President Roosevelt that Russia withdraws her retalia
tory tariff against American goods, giving us admission to her mar
kets on perfect equality with all other nations. . . ,
It is surely an august and impressive spectacle. Two warring
nations, in a death grapple in one of the greatest wars in history,
the most exhausting, the most sanguinary, with its stake the political
control of Eastern Asia, both court , the. commerce of the peacemaker.
Some critics of the President questioned his action in interfering, as
they put it, in a war between two foreign powers. They saw in it
signs. of "an .entangling alliance," that would seriously involve. us in
the. future quarrels of . the .world. . But he went on, regardless of
these misgivings, and' time and again prevented a - rupture between
the peace envoys, finalty bringing them together in a settlement. The
rival armies are cheering him in> Manchuria, and the, countries they
represent are both racing for our commercial favor. It will be ob
served that this has been accomplished without any commercialcon
cessions on our part. We give nothing and what we gain is all gain,
without any discount inimical to our trade. Russia gets no,enlarge
ment of her access to our markets. But she opens her own to us,
for a trade that* will soon swell into the many millions. It is one of
the most conspicuous victories of peace.
The act of Russia in placing retaliatory duties on our com
merce was brought about by the Dingley tariff, which puts a coun
tervailing duty on bounty paid beet sugar. Russia, like the other
beet sugar. countries of continental Europe, pays a bounty on the
production of that sugar. The result is that beet sugar,. stimulated
by the bounty, is produced by nearly all of the bounty paying coun
tries in a surplus for export. To admit this product at an equalit) r of
duty with the non-bountied cane sugar would place the 'countries
which produce the latter upon an inequality amounting to a great
disadvantage. Our countervailing ; duty is, therefore, intended to
put the sugar producing countries upon an equality in our market.
German}' was ruffled by it, and though she' does hot give that as .1
specific reason for her commercial war upon us through Her new dif
ferential tariffs, it is no doubt a factor-in that policy.-
Russian retaliation took the form of excluding our manufac
tures, especially our metals and machinery. As she is the most
backward of the countries" in metal and machinery manufacture, her
growing demand for such articles has "made trade in them of vast
value. Since she retaliated upon us her market has been supplied by
Great Britain and Germany. They have the advantage of the great'
demand for machinery in the construction "and equipment" of the
trans-Siberian road. The completion of that thoroughfare opens an
immense agricultural country in Southern Siberia, and a great min
ing country in Northern Siberia. The , colonization of these two
sections of that great province from Central Russia has been inter
rupted by the war and will now be resumed. â¢* As it; progresses the
demand for farm and mining tools, implements and machinery will
rise. How captivating is it to the imagination that President Roose
velt, by making peace, has made possible the settlement of such a
region, causing a demand for what our industry- can supply, and has
so impressed the Czar that the whole market is thrown open to our
enterprise !
Every home made in that region which, tempted the alnbition
of Alexander the Great will have the hand of the American President
impressed upon its lintel. Every field will owe to him its harvest
and every dollar gained in trade by his country will be in praise
of his policy, diplomacy and persistence, in making a peace which
probably prevented a conflagration of the world. It must not be
forgotten on .this coast that we are the nearest to Eastern Siberia
and -that Vladivostok, connected by rail with Krasnbiarsk and Omsk,
â¢will : be the port by which our trade will enter Siberia and find its
4 way north and south.
President Roosevelt has broken the record as. a- ; peacemaker/ as
he has. broken all records in our domestic politics. -Between" man
and man in feud, the peacemaker usually finds himself repaid for his
benevolence. by the: ill will of one of the parties. But the President
has made. peace not only with the personal good will s>i both parties,
but with trieir first, commercial favors for the trade of his country.
There is a growing indisposition in the country to. lose!; his services
while he is in the prime of life. But of that-,we snail see' what we
â¢hall see later on. ' ": -
AN INTERESTING FIGHT.
rHE resumption of the boodler trials at Sacramento promises to;
furnish a legal duel of great interest.- Of all the accused men !
Emmons is the only one having real ability, and training. HisJ
nerve was tried the day the accusing affidavit was read to the j
Senate. A regular order Avas on, and Emmons wasVmaking.an.ar-J
gument to the Senate. The special order intervened and the affi- "
davit was read 'accusing him and Bunkers, French .and Wright of
bribery. WTiile the keenest fright and apprehension wefe^shown j
by the others, Emmons was entirely unmoved,' and on return to
the regular . order, pf business he resumed and finished his argu
ment without skip or miss. ;\u25a0; â¢) '"\u25a0';.;< '-â¢\u25a0" ? :::,: ? v '^; â¢ '
The man who could do that under such circumstances may be
expected to sho\y the prosecution a fight such as has never been had
in a California court. It will attract the attention of the whole State,'
and will be of interest to the legal profession, and especially to crim
inal lawyers. Viewed from either standpoint, as an innocent man'
mistakenly accused, or a criminal of -great ability and iron nerve,
Emmons is the only object of interest in the whole sad and sordid
business. It is not the first time that men of ability, lacking moral-"
ity,'have been accused of- like offenses.:. Wejhay^the erotic-and er
ratic Collins interesting the courts -jof two : nations,i^nd -likely to" be
come a figure in Washington and ; London, through appeals to the"
Supreme Court and the Privy, Council, but he is pushed out of focus
by Emmons. District Attorney Seymour of Sacramento has shownV
himseif a prosecutor ofunusual addfess, arid th'e'kind.bf* foeman he'
must meet now will put him on his mettle. -. X ' ! . â¢ i
It is not known Whether Emmorisjwillcpnductlhis own defense !
unassisted. But if he -have counsel he be theimotrvV power in i
the case any way, and Mr. : Seymour will have no time for napping.' i
It is .'already, apparent - that his; task is far greater than any imposed '
upon Mr. Folk in his prosecution of the St. Louis boodlers. Folk's I
success made him Governor of Missouri, with" higher places in pros- '
pect. What prophet can foretell what , political 7and jpersonal â¢\u25a0 conse
quences may follow the boodler^ trials. at Sacramento ?C We wish; that
courts and prosecutors might have sora e otliejFl way- 'of ; 'making/ the '

"JAGITIS" FROM
EXCITEMENT.
ii\jTS&\ ; In my opinion it is quite pos-
V Bible for ; a man to become ' ln
.. â¢* toxlcated Jn\ moments of great
exclteinen't," and sometimes a
man. will ") become Just as drunk as he
'wouldiifi he emptied:, the contents of a
gallon "jug,",; said the observant man] to a
new; Orleans 5 Times-Democrat reporter,
"though* It Is,' from my observation, very
rarejto flnd^a man who will lose control
of his legs in cases of the sort. Crowds,
with . the \ excitements that go along .with
these gatherings, the ! noise and hurry
and ; all â¢ that : kind of ! thing, will make
some men drunk as readily a3 booze." We
have known the same -condition to be
brought * about \ by ~i great heights ' or ' dis
tances, lin J the dizziness experienced, for
instance,. by some persons In reaching the
top of, High ; buildings. Seasickness in my
judgment is drunkenness. Have you ever
stood close to a railroad track while a
passenger train whirled by at full speed?
If t you ? have * you ! can - understand fully
what \T am to tell you. .The noise
and swift motion of the train intoxicated
you ' for - the : moment,"! arid : . for * the * time
being yon are just about as drunk as you
can be. ! Rapidly moving \ street cars will
have i the . same . effect '; on some I persons.
Tho: temperament of the person of coursa
has much to do with the degree of drunk
enness resulting * from, these conditions.
The crowd > is ; probably the most ' prolific
source of drunkenness of the kind I have
reference to. v Few : persons can escape
some sort of intoxication In a crowd. The
most sedate persons imaginable will show
the ; symptoms,; and you will find the con
ditlonto exist, no: matter, what the char
acter "of "the gathering. ! Crowds In the
streets* will cause it. We find It In the
ballroom.!. Church gatherings are not ex
empt.;! I have : seen * preachers, noted for
thelrj sedate, "courtly -and dignified bear
ing,' drunk with! the \u25a0 excitements- and fine
emotionalism of some big ; religious | gath
ering. ! , No '\u25a0: doubt ; almost ; every man can
recall many Instances of the . form, of in

"II Trovatorc!"
That is what the Tivoli gave us last
tiicht, and one would like to borrow
Mr. Angiolettl's high C to voice the pe
culiar joy of the combination. For tho
opening of the season Polacco promised
an "II Trovatore" according to Verdi.
We may or may not have had it last
night. If not, one is tempted to sayâ so
much the worse for Verdi! As Mr. Po
lacco grave the opera last nigrht it might .
have been made last week. It came with i
the dew on it. The barrel organist was
forgot; the thing ran red with youth.
Even the "Ah che la Morte" came as a
new thrill. It was all new but the house,
and that was the came magnificently
noisy, crazlly happy, crowd as of old.
The romance splendid, so done, "II
Trovatore" becomes. Swinging, flash
ing, pealing along goes the music â
and you make your own drama. Even
last night they did not quite succeed
In humanizing the story. It can't be
done. But very much was done even
in that way last night at the Tivoli.
that It .seems to matter very
' .-.men, with the drama of the music
sweeping along. As keen a trick of it
Verdi has as a Dumas. He makes very
Booths out of his fiddles, tragically
striding through the "Miserere," and
what of romance is lacking when he
flings into the cloaked silence the care
less jewels of the harp? Full of color,
young, blood pounding through every
pulse of it, pageant piling upon page
ant, the old opera went last night,' and
the audience said in every key that it
was grood.
It is quite likely that Thursday's "II
Trovatore" will be even better. A little
careful, restrained, Polacco's b*at still is.
On Thursday he will be able to trust
fully, to his people.
Assuredly these are the best so far
fathered together at the Tivoli. No cast
of equal excellence has before sun? to
gether .there. . For ..'artistry, pure, .and
eltnple, palm goes to the barytone, Signor
Moreo. but in Anjriolettl there is a tenor
of a thousand, and In Petrella a soprano
of rarest beauty.
One wonder* whether Signor Moreo
likes to sing the di Luna? It is the
bete noire of most baritones, and sung
usually as If he would rather sing 1 any
thing- else.. Sitrnor Moreo's di Luna
was a triumph from every side. He
slnffÃ like an artist and a gentleman,
and looks that way. Not so powerful
is the voice, but resonant to a degree,
and with the prettiest possible lyric
quality. His "II Balen del Suo" was
exquisitely sung, as indeed was his
every phrase. Excellent, also, on the
dramatic side was Sigrior Moreo's count,
' und as a picture it could hardly have
Jieen bettered.
The Angiolettl voice Is all that it has
been heralded,- a big, brilliant, ringing
tenor, and with a high C that sent the
house howling to Its feet. Charmingly
Signer Angloletti sings some things. The
duet with Azucena in the second act was
a superb bit of dramatic elnging, thÂ«_"Di
Quella Pira" another. It' was 'here, -With
the chorus and high C ' usually omitted,
that Angloletti got his first taste of a
Tivoli welcome. As to acting, Manrico
is hardly a role to judge any one from,
\u25a0and Angiolettl just sang it.
Gravina made his debut at Ferrando
and added agreeably to the sum of
success. He has the intelligence, the
distinction that distinguishes Moreo,
much of the sa.in<- artistry, and a voice
that, thoujrh light, promises most use
fully. .
In Olive Petrella, the Tivoli has a
soprano at' once uncommonly pretty,
dramatically gifted, and possessed of
a voice that satisfies all demands.
There seems to be no end to its power,
and it is brilliant and sweet to its final
t-h!Â«M.Â£. Very well she' eings, too, with
fine temperamental qualityâ one foresees
a .-plendid Floria Tosca in the young
wouuin. One has not heard many finer
things than the trio at the end of the
eecoud act. Moreo, Angiolettl and
Petrella.
Grasse ther* is, too,, a capital Azu
t-ena. One almost forgives her a bad
tremolo for the dramatic, truth of her
work, and there is plenty of a very
good voice varied by Miss Graese.
Then the chorus is the best of the
best of what the Tivoli can do this way.
So the orchestra, and Max Freeman has

The dramatic .version of Jack Lon
don's hovel, "The Sea ' Wolf," was pre
sented at the Majestic \u25a0; Theater last
night to a crowded^ house. There were
evidences of. a dispoeition to enthuse
on tho part of tho audience during the
early part of ; the eveninar, but as : the
play progressed there was an entire
absence of any pretense at enthusiasm.
Joseph Noel,- the; dramatist, has
neither, done justice to' himself nor. to
the author. The play is bttÂ«y con
structed. - .There i 3 not u -climax that

California.
"The Wise Guy," which opened at the
California last night in contradistinc
tion to its name, is everything funny
and foolish. The \u25a0'\u25a0audience* enjoyed the
burlesque immensely. Edmond Hayes
in the title role deserves a gold medal,
brass-plated, for his success in mak
ing sore the^sldes of his hearers. Tom
Llpion (alias "Lydia Pinkham") was as
laughable in fact as In .no nunciature.
Gertie Wonderbllt also erred not at all
In entering the burlesque field.
There were plenty of songs to make
sandwiches of the strata of nonsense
and the "galaxy of beauty" or chorus,
as one may prefer, was quite ' better
than might have been" expected. 'â¢ -
Along toward the eleventh- honr'that
battle-scarred hero of Saturday's af
fray over the county line appeared to
box three rounds with a local, pugilist.
>.elson received such hearty applause
that he was forced to come forward
at the earnest solicitation of friends
behind the curtain and, niuch "against
his will, to make a speech.
Alcazar.
Romance and politics, love and. cabal
are happily blended In Villon, the Vaga
bond, and the hero or the title is aptly
personated by White Whittlesey. whose
temperament is nothing, if not . romantic.
\\ hile there is no intricacy of . plat, no
subtleties of motive to unravel, no psy
chological problem to be solved, the play
holds the interest of the audience from
the beginning to the tend. At the very
outset sympathy goes out for Villon and
the Dauphin and wtten-the poet is saved
from ignominious death on the scaf
fold the audience applauds*' and
the curtain falls on a touching ex
emplification of pootic justice. Eugenic
Thais Lawton, ' handsome and magnetic
played Catherine deVaucelles, the King's
ward, almost too sweetly for. so "cold
hearted an intriguante. 'No other wom
an of the company has , much 'to do ' or

was excellent support to the, leading man,

Central. . .
A well-filled house testified last even-
Ing to the merit of the production of
the melodrama, "Wedded, but No Wife,"
at the Central Theater. This play has
a pleasant plot and Is far above, the
average of the ordinary melodrama.
The performance was excellent.- Her
echeil Mayalland Edna Ellsmere
played the leading roles with convinc
ing force. Henry Shutner and Lillian
KUiot wefe the two wicked peoplfe in
the play and the cold-blooded manner
in which they plotted' ruin drew hisses
from the gallery.
George Webster added to his list of
clever character impersonations in the
role of a tramp, and 'James Corrignn
looked after the comedy. Little Ollie
Cooper pluyed a child's j role tn a j way
that drew te.ars from every one in the
front of the house. True Board man
and George O. Nicholls were good. 'The
remainder of the company renders ef
ficient support to the principals. '

S-T-R-O-N-G-L-Y I-N-D-O-R-S-E-D _ ' .
BY A NOTED CITY " E-D-I-T-O-R."'' -
"FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD" I , deliberately
and conscientiously TESTIFY- that after 20
years' distressing LAMENESS and exhaust-
Ing sufferings from RACKING : PAINS,
caused- by RHEUMATISM, which numerous
physicians and all kinds of remedies had
utterly FAILED -to cure, Rexradio, by 'only
FIVE SECONDS of his truly MARVELOUS
drugless treatment : absolutely, COMPLETE-
LY. "PERMANENTLY", removed EVERY
- SYMPTOM, root - and branch, and for â¢ a
WHOLE MONTH, to 'this date.v I have con-
tinued to feel like a' NEW MAN. without
the SLIGHTEST RETURN of any of the old
SYMPTOMS. I was > I-N-S-T-A-N-T-L-Y
(mark that word) able to STOOP to the
' floor. STAND straight. RAISE my limb 'to
a table and much higher; SIT . and â¢ RISE
quickly," naturally, without: the usual help
of my hands, and then I R-A-N fleetly and
J-U-M-P-E-D H-I-G-H from the floor MANY
I times, without strain, stiffness or pain, ALL
these : feats having for 20 years been abso-
lutely I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-L-E. I am still/ as
LIMBER, ACTIVE and capable of HARD
WORK as I was when a healthy, } strong
BOY; My f riends ate astounded :- and can
hardly believe their own ; eyes. : â¢': Since : m^
I-N-S-T-A-N-T \u25a0 CURE I \u25a0 have sent several
sick friends to Rexradio and he has quickly
and wonderfully -benefited, all. .Here .are
some of my FRIENDS, whose >: - NAMES I
can give you:". A friend, 28 years, \u25a0 TOTALLY
' DEAF, Instantly heard a distant WHISPER:
another of 25 years heard distant I whisper;
friend with LAME limb from SPINAL dis-
. ease . Instantly had -free: use of. limb; -friend
aged 79, nearly powerless PARALYZED leg,
instantly raised it a great height, RAN.
and LEAPED; an exactly similar, case in-
stantly RAN, LEAPED and DANCED;
friend's large ULCER quickly ~ healed:
friend's PARALYZED ] arm â¢ instant-
ly restored, grasped, lifted and '; swung
heavy furniture; friend" 1 with,", same trouble
and same "Instant" benefit; friend, hav-
ing " life-long agonizing STOMACH dis-
ease speedily cured. .IV PERSONALLY
, WITNESSED t" all : these : wonderful re-
sults, and pledge : my. 40 years' -reputation
In this city that they are all TRUE, and not
"exaggerated." Once I. : Imagined \u25a0' : Rexradio
was a mere FICTION, but NOW am SURE
Ihe Is a genuine ; REALITY and : the MOST
EXTRAORDINARY HEALER rOF - -THIS
CENTURY; and as a noted- city financier
(cured by him) said, I emphatically repeat:!
"I think he can do almost anything - but

BIG SUM SAVES
TO EQUITABLE
President Morton Reports
That Expense Account Is
Already Eeduced $600,000
REFOEM ONLY BEGUN
Agents Are Told That Re
trenchments Will Reach
a Much Greater Figure
NEW YORK," Sept. 11.â President Paul
Morton' outlined the - policy of the new
management of - the Equitable Life As
surance Society In an address which he
delivered at Manhattan Beach to-day to
750 agents of the society, who came from
different - parts : of -.. thÂ« country.
"After briefly. - reviewing recent - events
in the . Equitable, Mr. Morton said:
. I am goln* to say a few words to you on
your new administration. There will be no at
tempt to make it dazzlinmy brilliant. The ef
fort will be to maks It honest,, courageous and
conservative. :: There ; will be the â¢ greatest i con
sideration shown 1 for the policy-holders and at
every turn * thalr : Interest* * will be. - protected.
All of ; thÂ« : new directors arÂ« poUcy-holders.
Buslneaslike methods will prevail. The more
economy of the right sort wa can Institute/ the
more >wa can sava Ito - tha . poioy-holders. : In
vestments will ba of the highest character.
'i The ; Institution â¢ will not be run as an ad
junct to . any ' one or several banking houses.
Every owner, of securities will have a chanca
to deal with us, and - our aim will be to- buy
the vary best >at the very lowest prices. The
cheaper tho society can be properly adminis
tered, tha better wa'. can Invest our earnings
and the better showing we can make the easier,
will It : ba for agents to sell our insurance.
\ I want to aea the Insurance business removed
as t far; as possible, from politics. I believe in
| proper laws safeguarding tha sacred trusts of
: insurance ' and 1 1 will ; co-operate In the enact
; men t of ~ any necessary laws with that end in
view. 'We shall all i work to put ' the business
, of life - Insurance on the elevated plane It ought
to occupy;, - \u25a0
i The ' new management of tha Equitable will
insist on an annual audit of its affairs by an
unbiased and Â« independent accountant. . There
will be no attempt to deceive anybody; not even
ourselves.- â¢
Retrenchments " are the order of the day In
the Equitable. They will amount to more than
$600,000 a year, which is equal to 4 per cent on
an Investment of .$15,000,000. They will amount
to a -much larger sum before we are through,
and I am . sure that we will satisfy not only
our policy-holders 'and our - own agents, but
the many who will buy. what we have to sell.
EQUITABLE FOOTS THE BILL.
Entertainment of Its Agents Costs the
Society $150,000.
NEW YORK. Sept 12.â The Herald

the" Equitable V Life Assurance Society
are attending a convention at Manhat
tan" Beach, which opened yesterday. . It
Is; said that the entertainment* of the
agents \u25a0at the Manhattan and Oriental
hotels will cost $150,000 . of : Equitable
money, but if. was found to be abso
lutely necessary to. endeavor to inspire
renewed confidence in the ' Equitable
Society amongst its own agents.
Z Gage E. Tarbell presided yesterday
afternoon ; and said that â¢: Equitable's
business in New York City fdrthis year
was only $2,000,000 behind that of last
year for. the same length of time,
which, '.under' the circumstances, was a
remarkable showing. He promised
that the agents would be given a new
form of policy at the convention that
would make it easier than ever before
to write \u25a0 insurance; v \u25a0>: '\u0084-,-. \u25a0-

The report of G. N. Salisbury. Section Di

Washington Crop Bulletin week ended -Septem
txr S ia as follows:
ThÂ« wÂ«k was, oa tha whole, unfavorable
for crop*. It *v cool, and there was Ilgnl
frost reported In. exposed localities on Augunt
30, which, nowever, did little damage. There
light ehowers on two or three days and
la the northwest counties the rain was to
beavy as to damage oata. causing them to fall
oown. A heavy wind Â«torm on the 27th caused
much daiaare to crops in the central and
eoutheact counties, blowing down hop \-ines,
chattering much of tho wheat that remained
uncet. which was about one-fifth of tfie crop,
and blowing mach of the fruit trom the trees,
in toce localities nearly all.
Pastures and root crops were somewhat im
proved by the rain. Alfaira is growing well
and will make- a pood third crop. Tha late
potato crop wIU bÂ« eood on heavy soils. To
t&atoes aad melons are yielding One crops this

Â«â¢ *ffÂ«cU of lice In the western districts.
ThÂ« yield wIU be lighter . than a%-erage.
Threshing In tha heart of the oats district !n
the westers counties shows the yield to be
below tha average.
XUsults of threshing in thÂ« principal wheat
districts chows a great faUtnr off of the yield
from earlier expectations, due to chattering by
the recent high winds and to the July hot
spells. In the eastern part of Whitman County
tha hot winds greatly injured the wheat, caus-
Inc much of it to grade below number one.

trend gained headway -.an- influential bull be
came quite active on tlie buyins fide.. In con

ment of something more than $4,000,000
In cash for the stock, when it is depos
ited.
With this part of the business so near
accomplishment the completion of the
transfer will take some time. The stock
xcust be placed in escrow. The action ot
the stockholders cannot be immediate.
There is no chance for the deal to fall
through. The signing of the papers to
flay will practically tie up the entire mat
ter. The stockholders of the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company get an
advantageous offer for their holdings
and the syndicate has manifested its de
sire to hold the San Francisco Gas and
Electric stock by meeting and going
above a bid of competitors that was
made during the progress of the negoti
ations. * v â¢
The deal thus far has bÂ«en carried on
by a committee from the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company and the Cali
fornia Gas and Electric Corporation and
representatives of the Eastern interests
that have undertaken, with the Californa
Gas and Electric Corporation, to buy out
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany and to control Jointly the two cor
porations named.
For the San Francisco Gas and Electric
etock $25 a share will be paid in cash and
565 a share in bonds amply secured by
provisions heretofore published in this
paper. The work of the committee In the
premises Is done and now the directors
of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Corporation are to act.

BABY'S TORTURING

Ears Looked as if Would Drop Off-

of Soresâ Three Doctors Could
Not Cure-Child Grew Worse.
CURED BY CUTICURA
IN TWO WEEKS FOR 75c.
Mrs. George J. Steese, of 701 Coburn
St., Akron, Ohio, tells in the following-
letter of another of those remarkable
cures of torturing, disfiguring skin
humors daily made by Cuticura Soap,
assisted by Cuticura Ointment, after
phj'sicians, and all else had failed: "I
feel it my duty to parents of other poor
euffering babies to tell you what Cuti-
cura has done for my little daughter.
She broke out all over her body with a
humor, end we used everything recom-
mended, but without results. I called
in three doctors, they all claimed they
could help her, but she continued to
grow worse. Her body was a mass of
sores, and her little face was being
eaten away; her ears looked as if they
would drop off. Neighbors advised met
to get Cuticura Soap and Ointment, and
before I had used half of the cake of
soap and box of ointment the sores had
all healed, and my little one's face and
body were as clear as a new-born babe's.
I would not be without it again if it
cost five dollars, instead of seventy-five
cents, which is all it cost us to cure
our baby, after spending many dollars
on doctors and medicines without any
â¢ benefit whatever." - \u25a0

CAUCUS TO-NIGHT WILL NAME
NEXT MAYOR OF THIS CITY
HARMONY AND DEMOCRATIC) SUPPORT ASSURED
Delegates Resolved
to End Reign
of Graft
Auditor Baehr May
Be the: Lucky
Leader.
The caucus of the anti-Ruef delegates
of the Republican municipal' convention
at Pioneer Hall to-night will probably
select a candidate for Mayor, and there
are many indications that Auditor Harry
Baehr will be called to lead the forces ,
of good government in the campaign to :
wrest the control of San Francisco from i
the clutch of grafters. i
Whatever may be said touching the i
merit and availability of other aspirants '
for the nomination, there _is knowledge ;
that the favorable progress of Baehr's"
candidacy has caused intense apprehen
sion in the camp of the grafters.
Men familiar with the facts are astound
ed at the efforts put forward by the un
der-coyer supporters of the Ruef-Schmitz
administration and their corporate allies
to prevent the caucus indorsement of
Baehr.
The organization committee of the San
Francisco Republican League, consisting
of George D. Clark, chairman; Daniel A.
Ryan, secretary; Fairfax H. Wheelan,
John D. Daly. Richard J. Welch, John
Lackman, David Rich \ and E-* J. Bowes,
was in session last night from 8 until
11:30 o'clock. Another conference .will
take place at noon to-day. It is reported
that the names of Harry Baehr, Daniel
A. Ryan and John Lackman were con
sidered. Information was imparted at
the close of last night's session that the
prospects of agreement on lines of com
plete harmony were exceedingly bright.
A prominent member, of the executive
committee remarked: -"We will agree to
recommend to the caucus a good man
for Mayor and a man who will readily
obtain the indorsement of the Demo
cratic convention."
It transpires that the name of Colonel
John C. Kirkpatrick has been withdrawn.
The story goes that he would not accept
a nomination if It were not freely and
harmoniously tendered. \u25a0
The executive committee of the league
Is confident that 231 delegates, compris
ing a substantial majority, will meet in
caucus at Pioneer Hall this evening.
The grafters are working with despera
tion to detach a delegate, here and there
from the league column and holding out
to candidates promise of labor indorse
ments as a reward for helping Ruef in
his efforts to defeat the league, but there
are no signs of weakness or wavering In
any of the delegations elected under the
auspices of the Republican League
Aspirants lor office clearly understand
that the "favor of Ruef will bring dis t
aster to their candidacy in the conven
tion. The feeling is stronger than ever
that San Francisco has â¢ had enough of
Ruef and Schmitz.'
The Fortieth Assembly District dele
gates to the Republican convention met
last evening at 2100 Bush street and
elected Albert E. Castle chairman and
Sam N. Levy secretary of the delega
tion. A resolution was adopted pledg
ing the delegation to use all honorable
effort to bring about the nomination of
Harry Baehr. for; Mayor.

Members of \u25a0Â£he Board Accuse

; ; PoKtics at the Expense
of Municipal Development
There . was considerable wrangling
among the members of the Board of
Supervisor's, r which resumed its business
sessions yesterday 'after a " vacation of
fivs'weeks, over the, differences that have
arisen , between the \ Democratic majority
and. the Schmitz faction relative to the
construction of new school houses under
tho bond Issue. \u25a0 v
. fhe ! debate -. became very ' acrimonious,
each side ' accusing "; the \u25a0 other of attempt
ing to do politics, and at one stage of the
proceedings -it looked as if the Britt-
Nelson -contest would - be emulated. " \u25a0.:.".
\u25a0?. The wrangling was precipitated when
;a report from the Finance Committee was
read by the clerk. The report follows In
pa-rt:,-^'r:;i:':-v.j .;â¢- - :; ;; -; : y- . \u25a0''\u25a0'": v;-.;; : .
-: Each * appropriation for each ' particular
school, must :be held ' sacred' and the appro
priation â¢ for no school shall be impaired '. or
exhausted for the benefit â¢of any other school.
That is the express â¢ command of the law and
the dictate aa well , of ; sensible : business ad
ministration. The legislative body has already
'authorized' the construction of 'the Washington
Grammar School \ at an expense not to exceed
the full ' amount available, and 'it has appro
priated sums \u25a0 for the preparation of i plans for
the. following schools, viz: .Bay View, Monroe
Primary. Park, . Sunnyslde and Bergerot. v and
how* urges' that. work, on these buildings be
beÂ«un 'at 'once and - prosecuted diligently;
.â¢'-.- In i conclusion I we ' recommend |to administrat
ive < bodies the â¢ wisdom of .Immediate action
In " the construction >of our Â» school buildings
and deprecate delays \of deliberation and f con
ference that lead. to, nothing. We know of no
reason why the should not go ahead im
mediately, ii ' The '; legislative . body has acted.
It \u25a0 Is .now in" order. for. the executive; branches
of the government; to perform ' their duty and
to ; carry, out ' the i orders lof this . board, which
Is Itself in -turn simply obeying the- Instruc

will be more certainly Insured when executive

mation, and misreri .-.'iitatlon.; . â¢- -
NOT DILATORY.;
;\u25a0; As proof j that the -Supervisors- have not
been dilatory in the matter reference was
made to the fact -that the board has
passed ,' thirty-five ; resolutions .for -the
preliminary work relative to the erection
of ; : school buildings .and ; the purchase 'of
necessary sites for the same since March
9,' J 'i9os.-;- ;\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0;\u25a0;.; â¢ . â¢ ;
. D'Ancona said he regretted that -the
lowest -bid for; the -Washington Grammar
School was $215,000 and largely in "excess
cf .= ,- the! $119,000 ; available ;.under "the I bond
issue.^but there had -been -no legitimate
bidding, as two of '.the bids 1 were not ac
companied , by, certified 'checks. D' Ancona
said he wasjagalnst; using up the 'funds
set: aside -for other., schools to -make Jup
the i increased cost ; for the Washington
school, -which would ,be unfair, to "the dis
tricts ."in- which it. was desired Ito improve
the -school ...
;â¢. Gallagher made a strong objection to
the clause in the report ac
cusing / the g Schmitz administration jof
''political declamation and misrepresenta
tion,':, saying that; the progress of the city
would only, be : insured when the different
branches of the. city - government I would
accoid .to : one another; the honesty of

JUDGE SMITH MAIZES
ANSWER TO CHAEOE
Avers He "Did Not Intend to
Act in Gontempt in
Noel Case.
Judge Lucas F." Smith. Judge of the
Superior Court of Santa Cruz County,
appeared before the .District Court of
Appeals yesterday morning to show causa
why . he should not be \u25a0 punished for : con
tempt of court. .
Judge . Smith filed an answer in which
he :, declared that-; he had acted with all
respect and \u25a0 according to his best judg
ment in continuing the Noel caae and that
the | reason -he ' did j not obey the opinion
of Judge Harrison was only because the
document came to him. unsealed. He fur
ther showed j that he had always been re
spectful to the higher court "and that at
this : particular : time. :\u25a0 when he" proceeded
with the case in' question, h^ had acted
as he thought was right and courteous.
/ The. reason â¢ for -I the citation \u25a0of Judge
Smith came from his actions in continu
ing the famous Noel "divorce case against
the \u25a0 written , order of Judge Harrison of
the. District Court of Appeals. Theophllus
Noel, the plaintiff, through Attorney Del
.mas, asked for, a writ of mandate which
would order Judge Smith either to place
the .case with another Judge or show
cause why he 'should : not, do so. This
writ ; was granted ron August 12,'. 1905.
Then ! he"' continued with the \u25a0 case against
the objections of the plaintiff.
A nice point of law : was here involved.
The . question arose . whether this writ . ex
tended for thirty days after Its first issu
ance, this time not having elapsed * when
the ' proceedings were ; resumed by Judge
Smith, or whether the writ was no longer
binding. Judge Harrison sent in an
opinion to Attorney j Delmas .that the writ
was .still binding and it was this opinion
which was forwarded to Judge Smith.
It bore no seal and for this reason Judge
Smith; ignored it and called the case. At
torney Delmas' at once' brought the action
for contempt.
The case iwill be continued at 10 o'clock
this morning. The plaintiff alleges that
Judge Smith is very bitter against him.

on block 73 under the bond issue. The
protest says:
The people have voted to go ia debt at . a

Now, as the purposes for which thÂ» Grand
