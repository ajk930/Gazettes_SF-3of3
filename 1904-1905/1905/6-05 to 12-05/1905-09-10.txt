THE BEST OF THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES
THE ADVENTURE OF THE
SPECKLED BAND
This la the second of a Â«erfeÂ«
of stories by A. Conan -Doyle,
deallns vrlth the ail vent ure* of
the fnmous detective, Sherlock
Ilolmes, up to the time of hi*
memorable struggle for life
upon the Switzerland moun
tain path, ivith the redouotaltle
Mortality. Tlicrc are the orig
inal Sherlock Holmes tttoriea,
and the. ones irhlch made" Dr.
Doyle** fame. They ore entire
ly apart from. the series which
.recently appeared In the.Sun
day Call ' entitled Â«The . Return
of Sherlock Holmes."
(Copyright, 1905. by Harper & Brother*.) /.
ON glancing over my . notes of ' the
seventy odd cases in which I have
during the last'ieTght"yÂ«arT studied
the methods of my friend, Sherlock.
Holmes^ I'find- xnany., tragic^, some
comic, a large number 'of .,' merely jWanVeVi
but' none commonplace; for, ; workine .as
he did. rather for the love of his art than
for the acquirement cf wealth, he refused
to associate himself with any In veitlgaV
Uon which did not tend toward the un
usual and even the fantastic. Of all
these varied cases, however," I : cannot re
call any which presented more, singular
features than that which was associated
with the well-known Surrey family of the
Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The ."events in
question occurred in the early days of my
- SBsociatlon with; Holmes, ; when we were
' charing rooms 'as^ bachelors In Baker
ctreeL, It is possible that. l might have
placed them on record before, but a
promise of secrecy was made at the time,
from which' l have only been freed dur
ing the last month by the untimely death
of the lady to whom the pledge was
given. It is perhaps as well that the
facts should now come to light, for I have
reasons to know that- there are wide
spread rumors as to the death of Â° Dr.
Grlmesby Roylott which tend to make
the matter even more terrible than the
truth. .-'-'IV.
It was early in April in the year 'S3 that
I woke one morning to, ; find Sherlock
Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the
side cf my bed. He was a late riser as a
rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece
showed me that' lt -was only 7:15 I blinked
up at him In some surprise, and perhaps
just a little resentment, for I was myself
regular in my habits. ,
**Very sorry to wake you up, Watson,"
eald he, "but it's the common lot â¢ this
morning-- Mrs. Hudson has been waked
up. she retorted upon me and I on you."
"What is it, thenâ a fire?":
"No, a: client: It seems that a young
lady has arrived in a* considerable state
of excitement. ' who insists upon seeing
me- She. is waiting now.; in the .. sitting
room. Now, when ; young ladies wander
about the metropolis *at thls, : hour,' of \ the
morning â¢* and knock sleepy people out of
their beds I presume 'that it is something
i very pressing. which they, have to commu
1 fclcate. Should ' It \u25a0 prove "< to >be\ an inter- â¢
>estlng case you' would, I am sure, 5 wish" to
It from the outset. - I . thought, at
any rate, that I should call you and give
you the. chance.".
"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for
', anything."
I had no. keener pleasure than in fol
lowing Holmes in his professional " in
vestigation j and in admiring \u25a0â¢\u25a0 the rapid
deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet
always founded on a logical basis, .with*
which he unraveled the ' problems which
were submitted to him. \u0084I ; rapidly; threw
on my clothes and was', ready ' in < a few.
minutes to accompany inyvfrlend } down'
to the sitting-room. *. A' lady /dressed - in>
black and heavily velled,"Â«.who: had - been
sitting in the window, rose as we entered.-.
"Good-morning, madam I ,'.' said. Holmes,
cheerllj'. "My name^is, She'rlock'-Holmtt."-

'.'When Dr. Koylott t was In India, no
married ": my. mother, Mrs. Stonar, the'
young; widow of Major-General S toner,
of 'the Bengal Artillery. My, sister Julia.
and I were twins, and we were: only two
years old at the time of my mother's re
marriage. She had - a considerable sum
of \u25a0> moneyâ not less . than Â£1000 a year-;
and this she bequeathed to I>r. - Roy
lot t : entirely while we resided with. him.
with;; a , provision that a certain annual
. sum should ' be allowed . to each of -us In
the event of our marriage. " Shortly after
our return to England my mother died â
she was killed eight years ago In a rail
way accident ] near \u25a0 Crewe. Dr. Roylott
then , abandoned his attempts to estab
lish himself in practice In London and
took ;us to . live with " him in the old ' an
cestral house at Stoke '-" Moran. Tho
money which my mother had left was
enough for all our wants, and there
seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
- "But â¢ a . terrible change ' came* over my
stepfather about this time. Instead of
making friends and exchanging visits
with our neighbors, who had at first been
/overjoyed to ' see " a .Roylott of Stoks
. Moran - back In the old family : seat, ha
shut himself up In his houso and seldom
came . out, '. save \u25a0\u25a0 to < Indulge in ' ferocious
quarrels T with whoever/ might cross his
: path. ; of\ temper approaching
to ' mania has been hereditary in the men
of ithe "family, 'and in my stepfather's
case it had. I believe, been intensified by
his long residence in the tropics. A series
;of disgraceful brawls took place, , two of
uwhich^ended.in the police'court, until at
>last< he became the terror of the -village,
x and ' the] folks" would fly 4 at his approach.
" for he Is a man o( Immense strength, and

opened his lids now and glanced across
at his .visitor.. .. , , .
"Pray be precise as to details," said he. -

" Roylott â¢. had ; gone ; to his - room , early,

pressed me. My sister sJbd " I, you will
recollect, were twlns.'-and you know how
subtle are the links which. bind. two souls
which are so closely allied. J It was <a wild
night. ! The wind was howling j outside
and the rain was beating and splashing
against the windows. Suddenly, amid all
the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth
the, wild scream of a. terrified^woman. , I
knew 'that it was sister's voice. 1
sprang from my bed, wrapped, a shawl
round me and rushed Into the* corridor.
As I opened my door I seemed fto hear a
low whistle, such as my sister Â«Jesdrlsed,
and a few moments later a clanging
sound, &s if a mass of metal had fallen.
As I ran down the passage my sister's
door was unlocked and revolving slowly
upon Its hinges! ' I stared at it horror
stricken, not knowing what was about to
issue from it. By the light of the corri
dor lamp I saw my sister appear at the
opening, her facÂ« blanched with terror,
her hands groping for help, her whole
figure swaying to and fro like that of a
drunkard. I ran to her and threw my
arms around her, but at that moment her
knees seemed to give way and she fell to
the ground. She writhed as one who is
in terrible pain and her limbs were dread
fully convulsed. At first I thought that
she had not recognized me, but as I bent
over her ehs suddenly shrieked out in a
voice which I shall never forget: 'Oh, my
God! Helenl It was the band! The
speckled, band ''There was something
else which ehe' would fain have said, and
she stabbed with her finger into the air
in the direction of the doctor's room, but
a fresh convulsion seized her and choked
her words. I rushed out, calling' loudly
for my stepfather, and I met him hasten
ing from.: his room In his -dressing-gown.
When he' reached my sister's side she
was, unconscious, and though <he poured
brandy down her throat : and -' sent for
medical aid from tha village all; efforts
were In vain, for she slowly eank and
died without having recovered her con
sciousness. Such was the dreadful end
of my beloved sister." ' â¢ \u25a0
"One moment,"! said Holmes; "are you
sure about* this " whistle and metallic
sound? Could you swear tp it?"
"That was what the County Coroner
asked me at the Inquiry. It is my, strong
impression, that I heard it, and . yet.
among â¢ the crash of the; gale and the
creaking of an old house,' l may possibly
have been deceived." ;
"'Was your sister dressed?"
"No, she was in her nightdress. In her
right hand .was found the charred stump
of a. match and in her left a match boxt"
"Showing . that she had struck a light
and looked 'about her when \u25a0 the" alarm
took place. 'That is important;* And
what conclusions did ; the; Coroner .come
to?'!.-,., ,'_['\u25a0 V. />/' * \u25a0'. \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0-.:. :-;U^i
"He investigated the case/ with great
care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long
been notorious In the county, but he was
unable to find any satisfactory ' cause/ of
death. My evidence showed thatithe.-door
had been fastened upon the inner side,
and the windows were blocked, by.; old
fashioned shutters with broad Iron bars.
which were secured every night. /.The
walls were carefully sounded and were
shown to be quite solid all around, and
the flooring was also thoroughly exam
ined, with the same result. The chimney
Is widÂ«, but It Is barred "up by four large
staples. It is certain, therefore,, that my
sister was quite alone when she met her
end. Besides, there were no marks of any
violence upon her." ;
"How about poison?" ;
"The doctors examined her for. it, but
â¢without success." /^<
"What do' you think that this unfor
tunate, lady died of, then?" . â¢ .
"It is my -belief that ehe died of pure
fear and nervous shock, fthough what it
was that frightened her I cannot im
agine." ' \u25a0 ; \u25a0 \u25a0
"Were there gypsies In" the planta{lon
at the time?" '
"Yes, there are nearly always some
there."
"Ah, and what did you gather from this
allusion to a bandâ a soeckled band?"
"Sometimes I have thought that it was
merely the wild talk of delirium, some
times that it may haven-efcrred to some
band of people, perhaps to these very
gypsies In the plantation. Ido not know
whether the spotted handkerchiefs which
so many of them wear over their heads
might ' have suggested the . strange ad
jective which she used."
Holmes shook his Â»Â»cad like a man who
is far from being satisfied.
"These are very deep waters," said he.
"Pray go on with your narrative."
"Two years have passed since then, and
my life has been until" lately lonelier than
ever. A month ,ago, however, a dear
friend, whom I have known for many
years, has done me the honor to ask
my hand in marriage. His name is Percy
Armitageâ second eon of Mr. Armitage,
of Crane Water, near Reacing. My step
father has offered no â¢ opposition to the
match, and we are to be married in the
course of the spring. Two days ago some
repairs were started In; the west wing
of the building, and my bedroom wall
has been pierced, so that I have had to
move into the chamber in which my sis
ter died and to sleep in the very bed
in which she slept. Imagine, 'then, â¢, my
thrill of terror when; last njght, as I
lay awake, thinking over her terrible
fate, I suddenly heard In the silence of
the night the low whistle "/which had been
the herald of her own death/* I sprang
up and lit the. lamp, but nothing was to
be seen In the room. I was too shaken
to go to bed again, however, so I 'dressed,
and as soon as it was daylight, I slipped
down, got a dogcart a{ .the Crown inn,
which Is . opposite, 'and drove to Leather
head, whence I have cdmeon* this morn
ing with the onÂ© object of seeing you and
asking your advice." - #
"You - have done wisely,*' ; said my
friend. "But have you told me all?"
"Yes, aIL"
"Miss Roylott, you have hot You are
screening " your stepfather."
"Why. what do. you. mean?"
For. answer Holmes , pushed back the

'- "What can it mean?" I gasped.

Is % for the best.- Take your pistol and
we* .will enter Dr. . Roylott's room."
With a grave face he lit the lamp and
led the. .way down, the corridor. Twice
he struck at the 'chamber door without

the handle <and entered. I at his heels.

"eyes. On the .table stood a dark-lantern
-with the "shutter half open, throwing a

safe, the door of which was ajar. Be- :.
side this ; table, on the wooden chair, sat
Dr. onmesby Roylott. clad in . a . long
gray dressing-gown, his- bare ankles pro-,
truding beneath, and his feet thrust Into '.'
red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his
lap lay the short stock with the long
lash which we had noticed during the
day. .. v Hla chin was cocked - upward and
\u25a0\u25a0 his eyes- were fixed in a dreadful, rigid .
stare at the comer of tha ceiling. Around \u25a0
his brow, he had a peculiar yellow. band,
with " brownish speckles, which seemed
to s be, bound ; tightly around his head. As
we entered -he made neither sound nor â¢
motion. * Â» .: '" :
-."The band! the speckled band.* whis
pered Holmes. took a step forward, \u0084

'to" move, and 'there reared itself from

to the conclusion that the doctor "met his ~~~
.fate "which I had yet to learn of the 'case. \u25a0 * :
.was. toiC -by Mr.' Sherlock 'Holmes as we
traveled" back next day. >Â« ,â¢-..., ..
' "I had."; staid he, "come to an entirely
erroneous conclusion, which shows, my â¢
dear Watson, how dangerous It always .is
: to- reason, from t insufficient ; .data. . The
presence of the gypsies and : 'the use of
the word .'band,' which was : used by the
poor 'girl, no doubt to explain the'appear- .
ance -which she had caught a hurried
glimpse of by the light. .of her-,match.
-were sufficient to put me uponan.entirely
wrong scant. I can only claim the merit
that I instantly reconsidered my position
when t however, " it became â¢ clear to " me
that /whatever danger threatened ' an oc
cupant of the room could not come either
from the window or the door. My atten
tion was speedily, drawn, .as I have al
ready remarked to you.' to this ventilator
and to the, bell-rope which hung down to
\u25a0the bed. r . The discovery that this was a
dummy and that the bed was clamped to".
'the'floor instantly gave rise to the-suspi
cion thatthe rope was. there. as a. bridge .
fori something passing, through' the hole
.and coming to the bed. Thelidea of x a
snake instantly occurred to me, and when
.1 coupled /ii with' my knowledge that the
doctor 'was furnished with a supply of
creatures from India I felt that I prob
vably was on the .right track. The Idea of
using a ,form of poison which could not
possibly - be - discovered by any chemical
test was Just such a' one as would "occur
/to a clever and ruthless man who had an .
Eastern * $ training. The rapidity -i with -
! which such a poison would taker , effect
'would also, from his point of view, be an
"advantage. , It. .would be a sharp-eyed
'Coroner.' indeed, who could distinguish
the two little dark punctures which would
show ,where . the poison * fangs . had done
their work. Then I thought of .the whis
tle. Of; course, he must recall the snake .
"before the. morning light revealed it to
the victim.. He had trained It. probably
by. the^use of the milk which we saw, to '
return to him when summoned." He would
put it. through this ventilator at the hour
that hhre r thought best. -with.. the certainty
that It would crawl v down the "rope and
land on -.the "bed." It might or might not
bltej the "occupant; perhaps she might es
.cap'e every night for. a week, but sooner
or later she must fall a victim.
"Ihad come to these conclusions be
fore"l had entered < his room- .An In
"spection of " his chair showed me that .
he had, been In the" habit of standing
oh 'it,', which," of course, would be neces
sary in order, that: he should reach the
ventilator. : The, sight of -the safe, the
raucer of milk.jand the loop of whip
cord were enough to finally dispel any.
doubts, which may have.. remained. The .
metallic";* clang heard by Miss . Stoner *
was i" obviously:, caused 'by. her .step-.

voice out of a big, wide-armed re
volving chair.
The declaration, so quietly, almost
shyly made, is accompanied by. a

upward the corners of an enchanting cu
pid-bowed mouth. Above the smile, shin

This is Portia of the Police Court.
I ask my question unsuspectingly, with
my hand on the knob and but one foot
over the threshold of that office room in
the Clunie building which, according to
the lettering on the door, is sacred to
CLARIBEL, DAVID
Attorney at Law.
There Is no one In the room but this
piquant little figure in the ample em
brace of the big armchair; and surely no
one, not even a newspaper woman accus
tomed to the contradictions and surprises
of this most surprising world, would sus
pect this pretty, petite, pink-tea person

frock and soft silk blouse, with the dainty
lace collar setting off her round, white
neck, with the tiny, trim, patent-leathered
foot swinging six Inches from the floor, of

doorâ of being in fact. Claribel David,
attorney at law. 4
I am sure 1 do not.
She may be a younger sister waiting in
the ante-room, while Portia is within in
eccret, solemn consultation with a client.
I offer this to myself as the first guess.
may be an admiring, petted girl

tia in her hour of ease, for your able,
strong-minded, pioneering woman not in
frequently has her softer side, which she
i:idulÂ£Â«.s by coddling some dear, fluffy girl
thai is all she is not.
1 accept this casually as * second guess.
But Po/tla herself?
The enterprising young woman who is
the firtt of her sex to practice law in the
Police Coilrt?
NoJisense!
4 ra possible!
I'oit.ii. 1 remind myself, has been prac
tic.;!g ia\v uere for two years.
PoÂ» tia ucnt through the prescribed
cLUisse at Hastings Law College before
taking her degree with honor.
Portia put in a preparatory yearâ or
*.iis it twvâ in the college of tetters As a
co-td at the University of California, n
She con*<4entJously finished the high
Â£choo! course at L<owell before that.
She traveled 1 the preliminary' educa
tional route from start to finish at the
Hamilton Grammar School, aqd was the
xned&iist of her class.
AH this industrious pursuit of knowl
edge takes time and leaves its marks.
And the pretty little personage in the
revolving chair, who swings around with
the opening of the door, who turns her

and in the most accustomed way when
1 ask for Claribel David, attorney at law:
"I am the."
I am staggered.
There is so little of herâ not more than
a hundred pounds; not more, scarcely a
fraction more, than five feet of her. . 1
have three and three-quarter inches the
b< X of her, and as she rises to give me
her hand I feel myself towering above her
splendidly. I wish my friends could see
me.
There U so little of herâ but what there
Is is charming.
I had not expected to find her like this;
jet finding fcer thus, I would not have her
different.'* !'..'â.
When woman's scojÂ»e is widened It is
always an interesting circumstance.
Such a circumstance occurred the other
day. when Claribel David, attorney at
law. made ' her appearance in Police,
Jndgc Mosan's court in defense'of a pris
oner charged with vagraucy and assault
and batten* and ' a general and deplorable
lack of private and civic virtues.
Long before Claribel David was born
the right ct woman to cultivate wrinkles
and make the . beauty doctors a paying
profession by- fctudying law was estab-
and the' woman lawyer ceased to
a novelty. But her ways in the legal
prolusion . were the quitt ways of the
prybattf courts and courts of equity, of
aUvice and compromise lw the way of :
Â©nice practice.
lato the uraeiislit of criminal practice
che never ventured, and the police courts v
km w. her not. . : /
Ai least not until' the days of Claribel \<
Diivid. i;--;^ ' ' \u25a0_'.''
in this new field eÂ»f her profession she 1 '
la the pioneer of her sex. Â» ,'i
fn spile of all the crowing she has done ( '
on'hti- own cccount and the polite appro- i
bation she luis received from men. In I
spiv <jf the pleasant exchange of profts- J,
kkmai iKTslflage. the woman who enters,
a m^n'ii profession knows thiit Bhe enters .
the camp of the < t.cmy. and that she must <
ja.ikÂ«r her way with discretion and circum- '
tpection. She finds uut that man doesn't \
cany his chlvaliy into bis business, that >
he regards her as an interloper, and takes ;
on unholy* 1 joy in her discomfiture. i
She must carry herself with something',
of the caution and the vigilance of thei
lion tamerâ with a firm show of self-con- r
fidence and at the same time a secret un- '
densUtndiug of the limit of his tolerance.'
If she would make her way she must not |
presume, but walk with due propriety and ,'
humility In the way he % opens to herâ i
and keep her^ weather eye open. '
With . this tacit understanding, in the \ >
| profession of the law It is decreed by, l
lÂ»iÂ«Â»n and agreed to by woman that crim-i
inal practice is not a seemly branch of .
the law for the woman lawyer. And as \
To say the vrry leastâ lt Is not respect- )

HELEN DARE
It la most unbecoming; most unworn- <
anly.
At least this is what an able member of '
the San Francisco bar tells me:
"Women lawyers are all right," he tells
me. "all rightâ in their place."
But Claribel David, attorney at law/. I
discover, seems not to have thought of
this at all. Perhaps with the insouciance
of youth, or the fresh' girlish Impulse' of
kindliness, she has overlooked this point
altogether. g^iZTi?-* \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0^^ -;Vl"^.is,K
At any rate, however unseemly, how
ever unbecoming, however unwomanly it
might have been for the woman lawyer
to go Into the Police Court, the reason
that took Claribel David there as a prac
titioner seems to me the most womanly
in the world. , *
We don't discuss the seemliness. the be
comingness or the respectability of her
professional venture. She seems not to
have thought of that at all. It seems not
to have mattered. So I pass it by.~"
I have a notion, in fact, that when she
so surprisingly appeared before Judge
Mogan and made her plea for her client
she never gave a thought to her profes
sional dignity. She' thought only of do
ing a kind act for another Woman be
cause it was in her professional as well
as her .woman's power to do it.
I ask her why she went into the Police"^
Court, and for answer she does not launch
into al discussion of the ethics of her de j
parture. She just says In the gentle",
sweetly girlish- way characteristic of her:
"Why. I know the mother of the young
man I defended, and I was sorry for her
and wanted to do what I could to help
her and her son.
"You sec. It was like this: This young
man. George Howath, for whom I ap
cpeared, seems to.me_more unfortunate
than bad. He Isn't altogether bad. I
think. few people are that, don't you?
I think there's some good in every one,
if we only knew how to reach it. .When
he got into trouble I thought it. might
help him to have another chance, and I
wanted to help his mother all I could; I
felt sorry for her; so I took the case."
'.'And I suppose you felt terribly cm- â¢
barrassed about appearing in the Police
Court?" ; 'i^:-jy-fi,
"Embarrassed?" She turns blue, won
dering eyes upon me. "Why, no; why
should I be? I knew v what to do.- It was
nothing; it didn't amount to muchâ just a
few minutes', work. And, besides, 1 got
him off." n^
'She tells me with a laughâ almost a gig
gle. It is so girlish, so naive, so frankly
pleased.
"I didn't actually win the case. He
wasn't acquitted, you : know; only al
lowed to go on probationâ but that's bet- '
ter than nothing." _^ -"
"And so that ends your Police Court
practice?" ..' -â \u25a0'-. i_' : ; -.._ ,
"I don't know. Why should it?"
"You would do it again?'*
"Why. yes, ; of course. Why not? If I
had me^ame good reason? If 1 had a
case where I could do some one somÂ«
why not?"^
Why not, indeed?
The fair, pretty, girlish face is very
earnest in Its questioning, very gentle and
spirituelle, and for the life of me, "even
though I know with what austere con
tempt the grave and reverend seigneurs
of the bar regard Police Court practice, I
cannot think of one good reason why
there should not be an angel in every Po
lice Court in the landâ a pitying, plead
ing, little, golden-haired, blue-eyed angel
in a smart little tailor frock.
"Then you would take a ctlminal case,
too?"
â¢â¢Why. yes; of course, I would. I have
never done so yet because 1 have never
had one offered to me. But I sec no rea
son why a woman lawyer shouldn't. .Very
often in looking over the cases In court I
see many reasons why she should. . 1 .
think where a woman Is involved that
very often a woman lawyer could get the
facts of the case from her more success
fully than a man, and could present them
more justly. I -~n see no 'impropriety'
in a woman pleading for a woman. Can
you?" . ,
And again, for the life of me, I cannot.
Can you?
Yet, after all, this Is not law.
This* is merely sentiment.
So I ask her. by way of rehabilitating .
myself: .
"Why did YOU study law?"
Perhaps-1 ask it a' little resentfully, a
little captiously. , v
Foe why shouldn't this little golden
haired girl with the big. swlous blue eyes
have been a poetess or a reformer?
"Why?" she says. "Why, just because
I had a taste for" law. I suppose. Just as
other girls have a taste for music *or
painting orâ anything. - :
\u2666'Why. I remember that frdm -the very

and lt?is the part of wisdom, to borrow;
money from friends and acquaintances.
1 Experience has proved that the cash
'basis is a.';b*ad oiio for. any workingt

H. A- I* Ryfkogel. M.D., instructor

epoke on the theory of yellow fever In

as follows:
"As late as 1830 Surgeon General
Sternberg concluded that the cause- of
yellow fever Infection had not been
satisfactorily proven- - The 'mosquito
theory* did not then agitate the minds
of medical melÂ£ In '^lB37 Saranelli of
Buenos \u25a0 Ayrcs discovered' '9. \u25a0 bacillus,
which, he claimed, was the . -one re
sponsible for the dread yellow-fever.
As proof of his contention he asserted
that he had produced symptoms very'
closely resembling yellow, fever in ani
mals which he had contaminated with
the bacillus. . Further, than this, he

"This supposed discovery of Saranelli
attracted much attention and iri 1899
the United States Marine Hospital Ser

tigate its validity. , This commission
in due time reported, agreeing ; with
Sanarelli, much to the chagrin of that
excellent department later. ,The United
States Army Commission â¢ In Cuba . in
1890 examined a large number of yel
low fever cases and conclusively proved
that the former investigators were mis
taken andjthat the bacillus which they
had proclaimed the yellow fever bacil
lus was thalparityphoid bacillus, which
science well knows as productive of a
fever, but.-T>ot yellow fever.

were renovated, but no' attention was
paid to mosaultoes. In 1899 I6S deaths
occurred from yellow fever and In 1900
310*. deaths.'-' In 1901 the authorities
planned their campaign in accordance
with the mosquito theory. Fines' were
imposed; on those keeping uncovered
receptacles with water in them:!; pools
were covered with kerosene;
pyrethrum was used to disinfect houses;
cases of yellow fever were carefully
screened to mosquitoes' from
acquiring infection from them.-.. As a
result only eighteen deaths occurred
from- yellow, fever and some ibr, these
cases were brought in from neighbor
ing:, towns.; ; - -
Summing up, I would say that for
yellow fever infection there must be
first a case of -yellow fever, then there
must, be the mosquito, scientifically,
known as Stego'myia' fasciata, to carry
the disease. The fever is - due'to^ the
conditions ot swamps and other ' un
sanitary surroundings, only in so Car as
these conditions are favorable to- the
breeding of the yellow-fever-carrying
mosquito." y y
Researches made by Guiteras in Ha

confirm the conclusions of theAmetlckii

Mr. liurriscn's voice broke -in upon
toy gl<>omy reverie.
â¢"The protjosition is this: the. Olympic
Club has secured control of twenty acres
of land on tho ZUi<i of the ucw \u0084' cmi
shore railroad from Santa Cruz to San
Francisco. The location is a.bout seven
milct; south- of Halfmoon Bay or at ,'je
northern arm pf the half moon of the
bay.
"Most of the land is flat and level,-af
fording -the nucst sort of ground for
running tracks, inclcsurts for field sports,
tennis, football, baseball' and every sort
of outdoor sport. There will be a club

out: the slope being so gradually that
you can wade out a considerable disance.

i three and four hundred yards, before

due, of course, to the fact that the land

TbÂ«se advantages combine to make this
one of the must Ideal bathing benches in

"As I haxe stated, "Â» the project is con- .
ditiunal upoti the new road' coming
through that part of the country.'. But
i:iasr3urb as that e;iterprise is: now "an
atrui-ed thing. It only remains for. "the
final choice to be mÂ«de regarding .these '

road will be about twenty-flve miles, and
the railroad people have stated thut thfy
will niakc- a tlnie schedule of thirty-five"
â¢minutes from Sa.ii Francisco to . the
grounds. All of these features combine ;
toraake thl3, I think, the very choicest,
location that could possibly be secured
in any the country about San Krari
cicoo for â¢: the purposes of an outdoo
re<rÂ«-ation grounds for the club."

Immediately pursuant: thereupon I hied
me ecstatically toMax'Roscnfcld'e heÂ«id-

there was-- nothing to it but 1 automobile.

It was all fixed in* about two minutes,

Mr. Ram?dell v takes ur> the thought:
"Here you could place your tracks.

"and so forth. Put your clubhouse say
there, on 'that sl!Â«rht knoll. fronting out
to the ocean". Back there in those low

\u25a0for :golf links. But* here Is our blg:

you 'cannot duplicate that beach In the

a quarter of a railo and find, only e'sht

And etrtatn'.y all the conditions are
ideal. If for 1 no other one thin?, then
just for the sake' of r that two hour ridÂ©

"The German" â "Lunch for.flve."
While lunch, ls. preparing we cngagB
the .German (one Winkle) In conver

have a railruud on his -property and
plenty of neighbors and a clubhouse a

lncntrHerr Winkle looks unconvinced;
indeed, looks mournfully unconvinced.

tt \ WILL use Dominick to destroy
â¢ â¢ I and then I will destroy-
I him," I said to myself. But
*\u25a0 ih-\t did not satisfy me- . I
saw that I was temperizlng
with the weakness that has wrecked
more careers that misjudgment. I
ltlt that I must decide then and there
wnether or not I would eliminate per
sonal hatred from my life. After a long
and bitter struggle, I did decide once
and for all. : -'
I telegraphed Woodruff to go ' ahead.
WbtÂ»n I went back to Pulaskl to settle
my affairs there, Dominick came to see
me. Not that he dreamed of the ex
fotenee of my combine or of my connec
tion with the new political deal, but
simply because I had .married into, the
Karn&ay family and was therefore now in
the Olympus of corporate power before
which he "was on his kneesâ for a price,
like a wise devotee, untroubled by any
fcuch qualmishness of self-respect. 1 was
ready for him. I put out my hand.
"I'm glad you're willing to let bygones
be bygones. Mr. Sayler," said; '- he, so
moved that the tears stood In his eyes.
Then it flasheti on me that, after all,
he was only a big brute, driven blindly
by his appetites. How silly to ;pldt'ie
ven^es uixm the creatures of '.cireuin
staiiceâhow like a child beatins the Â«:hair
it happens to strike against! Hatreds
and tevenges are for the small mind with
>mall matters to occupy It. Of the stones
i have yuan-led to builds my career, not
one has been, or could have betn, spared
lo waste as a missile. \u25a0":'\u25a0"..;> '-^
I went down to the Cedar Grove
cemetery, whtrc my mother lay beside
my father. My two gisters who died be
fore I was born were at their feet;' her
parents and his on either side.. And I
taid to her, "Mother, I am going 'to climb
up to a place where I can use -my -life
as you would have me use it.-' To rise in
such a world as this I shall have. to do
matiy things you would uofc- approve. â¢,'\u25a0 I :

what they bad to handle that when they
arrived they were past cleansing; and
they neither kept nor cared to keep their

this pledge to you."
CHAITER VIII.
A Call From "the Hart r."
â¢ About a month after the Chicago and
Fredonia bill was smothered, in .com
mittee there appeared upon \u25a0 the
threshold of my office in the adminis
tration building of the. Ramsay Com
pany a man wnom at firm gla's'ce you
might have, taken for an exhorter or
a collector for some pious enterprise.
But if you had made a study. of faces
your second glance would have cut
through' that gloze of. oily, apologetic
appeal. Behind a thin screen of short
gray beard lay a heavy loose mouth,
cruel and strong; above it, a' great beak
and a pair of j>ale green eyes, intensely
alive. They were In startling Â«?oritrast
to the apparent decrepitude of tlie
stooped shambling body, far too small
for its covering of decent but somewhat
rusty black.
"Senator Dunkirk," said I. rising arid
advancing to greet the Justly feared
leader of my party. I knew there was
an Intimate connection between .this
visit and the death of hiÂ« pet project. I
thought it safe to assume that. he^ had
somehow ; stumbled upon : Woodruff's
tunnelings, arid with that well-trained
note of bis had exnelled out their origin.
But I need' not-have disquieted myself^
I did not then know how. softly Wood
ruff: moved, sending no warning-s .ahead
arid, leaving no irail behind.
â¢ For several minutes the Senator and
I. felt for each other in -. the dark in
which :we , both straightway^ hid. He
was tbe first to give up and revcul him
self In the open. ."But I do not . wish
to , waste * your time and my own, Mr.
Sayler^"' iie.; said; "I have come to see
you about the threatened spill Jn-ithe
imrty.;. You are perhaps surprised that
I should have, come to -when' you
liave been so many years out of politics,
but I ; think ,*yf>u will understand as I

a great, man." '.Dunkirk, went on. "\u25a0 "'But

possible demands, he ha^ declared .war on
the .party. "He haa raised', up In.ltajfac

ofjall that is abhorrent 'in; politics." \u25a0:\u25a0/-â¢
i ..\u25a0-\u25a0â¢ - -. .
"A faction headed by Domini ck- couldn't
be very .formidable." I suggested.
"But Dominlck' isn't the nominal lead
er," \u25a0 replied'- Dunkirk. "Roebuck is far
too shrewd for that. No, he has put for
ward as; the-. decoy my colleague. Croffut
âperhaps . you know him. If so, ; I
needn't tell you what a vain.' shallow,
venal fellow he Is. with his gift of gab
that fools the people.'* -
"I know him," said I. in â¢* tone, which
did not deny the accuracy of Dunkirk's
description. .
"Their object," continued the Senator,
"Is to buy the control of the party ma
chinery away from those wno: now man.
age It in the; interests of conservatism
and fair dealing. If they "succeed the
only interest that will, be (con
sidered in this State will be the Power
Trust. And w e shall have Dominick. : the
ignorant brute, lashed.^pn by' Roebuck s
appetites untU the people will; rise In
fury and elect the opposltlott-and you
know what It Is." \u25a0 ' "\u25a0\u25a0;. <~-i'^'-
"What you fay is most , Interesting,
faid I, "but I confess I haven't imagi
nation enough to conceive, a condition, of
affairs in which anybody with .'the price
couldn't get what he wanted by paying
for it. Perhaps the business interests
would gain by a changeâ the other crowd
might be less expensive. Certainly the
demands of our party's machine have be
.coroe Intolerable.". . ' *
â¢ "It astonishes me. Mr. Sayler, to hear
you say thatâ you, who have been in pol
itics." he protested, taken aback by my
hardly disguised attack upon himâ for
he was in reality "party:,* and "machine.
"Surely you understand the situation. , \v c
must have money, to maintain our organ
ization and to run our ' campaign. Our
workers. can't live on air; and. to speak
of only one oth^r factor, there arc thou
sands and thousands of our voters, honest
fellews, too, who . must be paid to
come to the ,- polls. They ' wouldn't
vote against us for any surh: but, un
less we pay them for the day lost in the
fields, they stay at home.. Now. whore
does our money come from? The big
corporations ore the only sourceâ who
else could or would give largely
enough? And It is necessary and just
that they should -be repaid. But they
arc no longer "content with moderate
and prudent rewords for their patriot
ism. They make bigger and bigger,
and more- and more unreasonable, de
mands on us, and so undermine our
popularityâ for the people .can't be
blinded wholly to ."what's going on.
And thus. year r by year, it, takes .more
and more money, to keep us in control. '
< "You seem, to- have forgotten , my
pohit.": said I. smiling- "Why should
. you'bekept in control? If you go out.
thc.otljers come in. They bluster and
threiateh.; in. order to get themselves in;
: but. once they're elected, they discover,
that! it ;wasn't the people's woes they
were shouting about, but their own.
And soon they are docile 'conservatives'
lapping away at the trough, with noth
ihir'dangerous in them but their ap
petites." -
"Precisely â their appetites," said he.
"A starved man has to practice eat
ing; a long; long time before he can
equal '? the ; performances of a trained
glutton'," I suggested. . . â¢
His. facial response, to my,' good
humored raillery was v feeble .' indeed.

To the Seats of the Mlsbty.
We, our -party, "carried the State, as
usual. :,"Oiir'*leglslatlve majorlty^was in
creased by eleven, to thirty-seven on
Joint _ ballot. IV was certain that Dun
kirk'a' successor would be of the same
political faith, .but would ,he .be Dun

partjv caucus for.' ainonthâ members from
the purely rural districts, where the senti
ment of loyalty is. strongest, where his
piety and unselfish devotion to the party
.were' believed in. and his significance as a
"statesman." I let, this deadlock con
tinueâforty-one for Dunkirk, fojty-on*
for Schoolcraft-until I felt that the
party throughout the State was heartily
sick of the "struggle. Then T^d" 1 *
bought, at $12,000 apiece, two Dunkirk men
to vote to transfer- the, contest to the
floor of a joint session of the two house^
After four days of balloting: there, sevas^
DomlnlcK-Croffut men voted for meâ nvjr
first appearance as a candidate- On _tne
seventy-seventh ballot Schoolcraft with
drew, and all. the Domlnlck-Croffut men
voted for me.. On the seventy-ninth bal
lot 1 got. in addition, two opposition votes
JVoodruff had bought for meat *SOO
apitce The ballot â¢ was: Dunkirk. .41.
Grassmere (who was receiving the oppo
sition's complimentary vote). 36r Bayier.
43.\1 was a Senator of the United State*.
There was a wild scene. Threats,
sults, blows even, were exchanged. Ana
down at the Capital . City Hotel Dunkirk
crawled -upon a table and denounced me
as an lnfamous'lngrateTa traitor, a Â»Â«r
pent he had warmed in his bosom. BUX,
the people of the State accepted tt ms
natural and satisfactory that "the-, vigor
ous and fearless young chairman of. tnÂ©
party*s.State committee" should be agreed
on as a compromise. An hour after that
last ballot he hadn't a friend left except
some galling sympathizers from whom he
hid himself. Those who had been nia
firmest supporters were paying: court to
the new custodian of the plum tree.
â¢ The Governor was mine, and tad
Legislatures Mine was the Fed
eral patronage. also â all of U.
If I chose, for Croffut was my dependent,
thoueh he did not realize it: mine also
were the indefinitely va3t resources of
the members of my combine. Without my
consent no man could get office anywhere

not 'defiedâ l was master of - the making
and execution of laws. Why? Not be
cause I.was leader of the dominant party.
Not because I was a Senator of the
"United States. Solely . because I con -
trolled the sources of the money that
maintained the political roachtaery of
both parties. The hand that hoTds the
purse strings 13 the hand that rules â
if it knows .how to rule; for rule is
power : plus ability.
. I.jWas not master because I had the
plum' tree. I had the plum tree because
I was master.
The Legislature attended to such of the
demands of my combine and such of the
demands of the public as I thoujht it
expedient to grant, and then adjourned.
\u25a0 Woodruff asked a three months' leave.
I did 'not bear from or of him until mid
summer, when he* sent me a; cablegram
' from -London. â¢ He was in a. hospital there,
out of money and out of health. _ I cabled
him, a thousand dollars and asked him
to , come home as . soon 5 as," he could. It
was my ilrst personal experience \u25a0 with
'that far from- uncommon American type,
the periodical drunkard. I 'had;. to cable
him money three times before he started.
.When, he came to me at .Washington,
in T December, he looked just. as before â
calm. â¢ robust, cool, cynical, and dressed
in the very extreme of the extreme fash
lon. -I received him ' as if nothing had
happened.. It was not until the current of
mutual liking was again . flowing freely
between us that I said: "Doc. may I im
pose i on your friendship to the extent
of an intrusion into your private affairs?"
. He started, and gave me a quick look,
his color mounting- "Yes." be 'said aflgi
a moment. .'â¢*.- jF'
"When I heard from yon." I went Â©a.
"I made some inquiries. I .owe you no
apology. You had given "me a shockâ one
of the severest of my life." But they told
me that you , never letâ thatâ that pecul
iarity of yours interfere with
His head was hanging. "I always go
away." he said. .. "Nobody that knows
me ever sees me when â at that time."
I /laid, my hand on his" arm. \u25a0 "Doc.
why do , you doâ that sort of thlnj:?**
; The * scar ; came up â¢ into ; his face \to
put agony into the -reckless despair
that looked from his eyes, s For an in
stant I stood on the. threshold of Us
Chambers of Remorse and Vain Regret
âand well I knew where I was. "Why
not?" he ; asked . bitterly. .' ."There's al
ways aâ sort of humorâ inside me. And
It grows until I can't bear it. And then
âI drown iiH-why shouldn't I?"
v' "That's very stupid for a man of your
brains." said I. "There's nothingâ
'nothing in the world, except'deathâÂ»
that can't be wiped out or set right. PlajT
the . game, Doc. Play it . with .me for
, five years. Play it for all there Is In It.
Thenâgo back, if you want to."
_He thought a long \u0084t ime.. and I did
not try. to hurry him. At . length -he
said,' in hl3 offhand maner: 7." Well. 4 I'll
: go you, Senator; I'll not touch a drop."
And '. he didn't. Whenever I thought
I saw signs of the savage internal bat
' tie against the weakness _.I. I gave hjaj
something Important and absorbing te\
do. and ; I kept him busy until .' I knetÂ«4
the temptation had lost Its powar (oT
the time.
. ; This is the proper place to put it on
the record that he was the most scrupu
lously honest man I had ever known.
'\u25a0' He ;dealt , with " the shadiest and least
"scrupulous of menâ those who train
. their consciences .to be eager servants
-of thefr appetites; he handled hundreds
% of thousands of dollars, millions, - first
and. last, all "of it money for; which he
could 'never have been- forced to ac
count. He has had at one time as much
as half a million dollars in checks pay
able; to J>earer. I am not confiding by
nature. or training:, but' l am confident
that he'okept not a penny for,- himself '
beyond his salary and his fixed commis
sion.'!! put; his salary at the outset at
\u25a0 ten thousand a year;, afterward at fif
teen; â¢ finally, at twenty. ." His commis
sions, perhaps, doubled it. \
.'-There are- many kinds of -honesty"
" nowadays. -There is "corporate hon
esty." not unlike that proverbial "honor
among? thieves." which secures a fair or
fairly fair division of ,the;spollsJ., Then
there ?is /."personal ; honesty," + which 5 sub
,; divides into three klndsf-legal,' moral and
Instlncttlve. Legathonesty. needs no defi

; how. untangle its intertwinings of motives
of fear, pride, insufficient temptation, sac-^
rifice of jtfce, smaller, chance* in the hope
. ;ofj a' larger? 'Finally, there Is Instinctive

Â«^"i GIRL who has brothers Is never
f | at a loss for comrades If her
r~l brothers have the right bring-
I ing up. There are brothers and
"* brothers, however. I heard ol
one not lons ago who was ashamed to
be seen walking to school with his
sister and who refused to carcy hÂ«r
books or her umbrella on a rainy day.
That boy may. one of these days be
very attentive to somebody else'B sis
ter, but he . will not prove a good
friend for all that. He has missed the
home training which lies at the foun
dation of all friendship. Boys and
girls in the same family and under the
same roof should be good friends.
Neighbors who attend school together
should equally be friends.. The boy
next door and the girl next door ought
not to be strangers, and In every street
the young people who arc growing; up
together should have good times -and
realize what It means to be friendly.
This does not mean that boys and
girls should be foolishly sentimental.
Nor do I think they onen are. ; You
cannot be sentimental about a '--boy
who is in the same class with you,
who helps you with your algebra, and
it may be is glad of your help in his
l.atln translation. So long as boys and
girls' enjoy outdoor games and indoor
pleasures together there is nothing to
be criticized in their friendship. It; is
only when they begin to be mysterious
and furtive about it that their mothers
ueed to take alarm.
For instance, when Willie hangs
about the door in the duck and does
not come in, but waits for Mary to
steal out and meet him at the gate,
there is room for complaint. Mothers
have told me that their daughters frojn
14 to 16 have been determined to walk
up and down in the evening with; boys
of their own age whom' the mothers
did not know.
Here is where the line should be
drawn. A school girl simply . cannot
have friends who are not welcome in
her fathers house, and of whom her
mother does not approve. She may not
write letters to boy friends or receive
letters from them without .taking her
mother into her confidence! ' If there
are picnics, merry-makings, .evening
walks, .drives or sails by moonlight.* it.
is all right if a gTOup cf boys and girls
are accompanied by an older friend. A
mother, cunt or married lady who is a
trusted acquaintance must take charge
of such a party. Above all, a girl must
have her life and conduct an open book
for her family to read. She cannot
have secrets and reserves from* her
mother. This is more important in the
real hi of her -friendship than anywhere
else in the whole of life's Intercourse.

"A question worth considering for
each of us is, what "do I mean to; my
friends? For what do I stand?
Girls do not always remember that
it is their privilege to exert a good in
fluence over the boys they know. A
girl who uses slang and permits.her
self to be rude and discourteous in tier
behavior to boys, who does, not 'exact
from them by her sweet behavior some
thing that is like homage paid to; an
ideal, misses her opportunity. Ido not
mean that a girl should be self-con
scious or a prig, but she should not
forget that she is in a way a little
princess, and is to be treated accord
ingly.
Ethel should not ask Theodora to
come and see her. any more than she
should beg him to.be her partner in a
dance. If he wishes the pleasure of a
call he should ask and she should grant,
and her mother should be present at
least during pa,rt of the evening. The
pleasant' and natural- way for very
young. people is to visit In the family,
and have every one coming and going
while they are there. .*
A good deal of pleasure is added to an
ordinary call If, before If Is 'over, there
is something to eat. Lemonade and cake
do not come amiss,,and there is no end of
satisfaction in an old-fashioned candy
pull if a half-dozen boys and girls .take
part in it. I have yet to see the boy who
does not like to call at the house where
the girls Invite him to help them { make
fudge. There Is the more fun if, the boys
help to clear away after the feast. .
We ehall never dp our friends good un
less we are ourselves right-minded, sin
cere and unselfish. ' There Is not the least
use In pretending to be what one Is not.
Unless we have real principles and. care
about living up to them, we shall never,
know the golden value of true friendship.

its hardships. \
: .They begin to realize at this time.
when tha wedding Rnery is faded and
the trousseau" is .worn-out, what the
real; strain of matrimony may, be. Small
means- complicate the situation for
some.-''' lf there be a fairy \u25a0 godmother
or^ a .wealthy spinster -aunt" or. a -rich "â¢
father-in-law, he or she may materially
add .to the comfort of the wedded pair
by bestowing upon them on the oc
casion of their leather wedding a
pocketbook well stuffed with. bills. AH
sorts of devices in leather, from the
daintiest purse to the latest thing in
traveling trunks, -fit into the scheme
of the leather wedding. At the first
mention leather suggests only boots
and" shoes, but on reflection one seea
that It. may mean much else of small
and great, inclusive of the softest of
Sleepy Hollow chairs and the most
luxurious of coucties. Nor would most
of tis despise a good stock of footgear.
The fifth year Is the wooden wedding
anniversary. The seventh the woolen;,
the tenth is signalized by tin. Each of
these anniversaries may call, together
groups , of dear friends and r may be
celebrated with much rejoicing. In
wood.' In wool, in tin, one. may choose .
gifts galore, regardless of expense.
f The twelfth year brings a woman her
china' wedding, and as no woman ever
keeps house without loving china and
having heart-breaks and heart-aches
over the way It is treated in heedless
hands, this anniversary , is one . that^
brings deep content. A walk through"
a large shop filled with china and por
celain ta an excursion into fairyland.
Her china closet is as precious in the
eyes of t a; matron as her jewel box tn
the eyes of a Queen. <-What delight In
Ailing it anew!
The happy woman who has had a china
wedding must wait three years more for
the crystal wedding which signifies fifteen
years of wedlock. Cut glass Is now the
proper gift, and in i his there Is endless
variety.
.After twenty years comes the linen
wedding. It is to be hoped that a shower
of fascinating articles will then fall on
the wife. By this time sons and daugh
ters assist in making the fete a success.'
"The twenty-fifth year brings the silver
wedding; then follows a long stretch in
which no special namo is given to a.wed
ding'anniversary, yet they are not to be
neglected nor overlooked.
r The fiftieth year brings the golden wed- v
ding, and the sixtieth year of marriage
the- diamond' wedding. . '._.-'
.A golden wedding day Is an event worth
celebrating In family history- Through
the shadow and shine of fifty . years on
ward from ' youth to old . age. the couple
have fared together.' Probably most of
those .who were guests at : their wedding
have passed away. ; but there are a few
who linger, - and ; they ; Bhould be honored
beyond other." friends, when the children
and grandchildren, the^ neighbors and
kinsfolk assemble- to give congratulations
on the gala occasion. .
\u25a0 The decorations should be yellow deep
ening, to. gold, and. whatever the season,
flowers may i be found "which will carry
out . this color scheme. : The bridal pair
should > receive their friends at the end
of /the room with a special background
of (flowers, amid which In white lettering
should stand out the two dates," thus
1556-ISOS, or whatever the years may hap
en to be. The same color scheme, yellow
deepening "to gold, should be carried but
in "the table where the refreshments are â¢
served, and .the golden gifts are In order.
Sometimes ."a '>. purse , of broad pieces is
made up and given to the_pair. with;thÂ»
request that they shall spend their money
strictly for their own gratification.
Very, few . couples are spared to cele
brate their diamond wedding. But .'as
the health rate of people in general is
everywhere on the increase, and llf Â» is
longer. than it , used to be. we may cher
ish. a hope that diamond weddings may
cease to be Infrequent.
Wedding anniversaries.;! repeat, should
never be passed by, without notice. The
household need not always call In friends,
from outside, but In the home: the day
that" wa3 home's : starting-point should
be marked by some unusual Joy. >

(Continued Next Week.)â¢"â\u25a0 VIGHT in the heart of this great
f J city and In spite of its wind and
Jr\ dust and its smoke and its
X fogr. there is a most beautiful
garden filled with luxuriant
vines and shrubs and abounding In
beautiful flowers and tropical plants.
TMs Is the garden of Dr. Harry Tevis
et his Taylor-street home. But the lo
cation conspires to aid him. Sheltered
from the winds by the hills in front
*nd safe- from the fogs that dampen
.the air farther to the west, the loca
tion is ideal for the purposes of plant
culture.
Dr. Tcvis has from his boyhood taken
a great Interest In ph-.nt* and flowers.'
und of late years has acquired consid
erable fame for enlarging some plants
end for producing new colors in so.ne
One of the finest carnations that we
have, the "Hunnah Kobart." owes its be
ing: to him. It is famous for its size,
bat chiefly for its beauty, and it takes its*
name, very appropriately, from one of
the most beautiful women in California.
The Tcvis mansion hides the garden .
on one side and on the Jackson-street
tide it is hidden by the slope of the
hill, which leaves the tMewa.Dc' way bslow
\u25a0 the garden, and by the stone wall and
fringe of trees above. The traveling pub
lic, however, has a glimpse of the wealth
of Us flowers in the abundant mass cf
tweetbrier roses which hang their blos
eoms over the top of the stone wall.
A garden party might easiiy be given
In this fine garden without exciting any
Interest or comment " from passersby, so
thoroughly is it concealed from the pub-
Looking from the east windows of
the house the natural outlook Is
exceedingly attractive, as the range
of the view extends from the~~o!d
marine hospital at the foot of Kineon
Hill and down the bay past Alcatraz anJ
Angel Island to Red Rock. Kerry-boats,
excursion steamers and vessels of all
kinds, are in constant motion and make
the view very animated and interesting.
Bat when one brings the vision closer
and looks down, there is an artistic and
highly cultivated garucn spread out be
fore one's eyes. A wide lawn, which is
Cropped <.oiitidcrab!y below the stone ter
race mar the house, extends down to tile
Â«:nd of thÂ« lot, surrounded and ornament
ed with lioweiu and fronels of many
kinds.
On the right ir; a "monkey puzzle" tree.
Jt is tall and thick and serves to shut oft
the view of icd locf* and uninteresting
dr.eliing houses which woul^J otherwise
form an undesirable background. But the
tree is extremely ornamental Â».s well as
uscftiL
Standing next to this trcj; is a beautiful
Pittosporum, the foliage of which la very
thick and of a beautiful shade of green.
Then we nci.t see an exceptionally large
nn<J vigorous banana tr:e, with enormous
frond*, that are \u25a0 sometimes rudely
tbrathed about by our Hun Francleeo
v. :;:ds. It Is an unusunlly One Epccimen
cf the banana tree, and must be;, 1 should
think, about twenty-live feet in height.
The effect is decidedly tropical and sug
gestive.
Aflvi that, there are several* varieties of
bamboo, of which tree Dr. Tevis has; made
a special study. He undoubtedly has more
varieties of i.umboo than can be found in
airy other single collection in the State.
*lh(-bÂ«: en.** ah<j are rudely switched
t.boui ;â¢:' Â»!jo familiar winds of the city,
but i?;ey can htand the assaults cf the
â¢wind much bitter than the broad leaves
of tha banana. /
Ficrn hie ranch Dr. Tovls has brought
te liW city carUcn only a few of the'
choicest varieties of bamboos, but his
collection at Ihev ranch includes almost
every known variety. He Is, Indeed, an
authority on the pubject of bamboo trees.
All these use.; are light and graceful, but.
their foh-j-ge differs, of course, being quite
tl:icl: and heavy in some of the varieties, -
as nicy be seen in one of the Illustrations
tc-doy.
Completing the semicircle, which is ar
rar.ge-Â«J to shut out the view of. undesira- \u25a0
b'.e thiny, la a myrtle, tha foliage of
which I* thick ai.c* soft.
Between this fringe and ihe house,
stretches the- real garden, and one of \u25a0. it*
charms is the Imprep^'on conveyed by it of
wlidne.'s. No bods are laid out and no
paUis cut 'it up, apparently. But there
arc paths, of ourse, only they are con
eealerj'fcy bamboo branches or some other,
kind of foliage. There is such a path, for
instance, running down the Jackcon street
side, and as one wanders down that path, "
the view of the unattractive street is
found to be entirely shut off by a hedge of
sweet brier roses 'of several different \u25a0
kinds. It' is astonishing how beautiful
and how varied are those sweet . briers -.
and how long they keep in -blossom.
They are the red. pink, white and yel
low flowers, and whlie they' are in bloom,
they are very beautiful. 1 am always as
tonished at thtir perfection and their
vigor. The fragrance of them is delicious.
The public passing by also c,an admire
these beautiful blossoms, because they
hang over the Jackson street tvall in
great profusion, but very fortunately tney
are so li!gh as to be out of the reach of
Within the garden itself, which we have
now skirted on two of its sides, are s'jme
of Dr. Tevis' specialties, tulips, which
art the wonder and aamiration of tvery
beholder. Standing on stems two and a
half or three *. Â«iisjh,'thcy are placed in
nfagnificent groups, according to their
colorsâ red, white, yctlow.'pink and royal
purple. 1 have never seen, anywhere else,
such imposing and bewildering masses of
color. Do they cultivate these mammoth
ant! gorgeous tulips in Golden Gate Park?
If bo. It has not been my good fortune to
s>Â«;c them there. (
'\u25a0.. It \u25a0 must not be supposed that, these
groups of tulips are email bedsâcontain-
ing si-.mplcs.'iis it won;. On the contrary,
one of the strikir.t; features .of - these
tulips is the wealth; of - them! One could,
pick several hundred, of- them in the at a-" '\u25a0
con, 1 !>>ive no. doubt. * , ,
Ntirt to tulips, and lrTno wise inferior ty
thÂ«.ni, .arc the dahlias. .There arc mure
than twenty-five varieties, of elahlias.
and all these the \u25a0 choicest and
showiest kinds, each one a gem.
1 "have endeavored to give, in a. pho
tograph an illustration of a particularly
beautiful- dahlia, Lut, naturally, the
picture, is disappointing. . Of course, .the .
color cannot be tshuwn, and, besides, the
surrou:itl!r.g slfrubbesy precluded .the pos
sibility of a good view of, lt. Almost the
only idea that the picture gives is of*it3
s!zÂ«i. ThiÂ« dahlia is of the cactus variety
uiid la called the \'ibÂ»ctUi. from its color,,
which Is a, very : dslieate shade of violet ,'/
All of these dahlias are imported from .
fc'cotlnnd. and Violetta is one of this sea
son's plants. It is certainly a most beau- \u25a0-
tlful production: The 'foliage is a very
rich deep green, which. set's off the violet
hue of the flower wonderfully well.
Vfoietta's tisters, and there are many 1
of them surrounding her, are all remark
able for siso and color.
Eut, quite naturally, every one hastens '
toward the greenhouses, on the old; prin
ciple that ."who loves a garden loves 'a
greenhouse,, too," . but' there Is a great r
deal 'to sco on the way.
Passing under a stone arch that Is cbv-\
ered with many kinds of rare ferns and
mouses and proceeding Â»-on : under the
fchade'of several varieties of bamboos and
â¢ palms, we reach a circle bounded on alii
sides by greenhouses, r
All, kinds of beautiful' things are to be
found in the magic circle, which is thick- ?

is the "Cup of Hebe/" "a most difficult

of a few of the lovers of roses. Mrs. John

B torm.w: t - #: : \u25a0_: .THE DEVOTION OF JOHN DUBBS
Copj-r! ? fct by the S S McC'.ure Company
PARADISK Is the grimly satirical
name of a desert station of the .E.
I\.& XV. Railway. A strong spring
sushes out of the earth in the bot
tom of a gxtlch. and the outburst
i*.Â«i waters go trickling ' down to extinc
*Uon over the rocky bed. The crisp hot
air prinks of the moisture ko tnlrstly. the
Band sucks it up w-ith such greed that;
less than a mile below its "source, the
faint trickle ends Jn a deep and silen. v
pool, frcra which there is no outflow.
Upon that liquid foundation the town
of Paradise was built, and, doubtless, in
that drought-stricken land, more than
one wanderer, coming out of the hell of
the desert upon that llfe-6aving stream,
passing the moist fluid over a cracked
end dusty tongue, had found the name
appropriate and even significant.
r From the railroad a long pipe trailed
over the ground to the dusty bank, where
it plunged beneath the surface of the
pooL A pump, standing In a flimsy board
house on the right of way. clanked end
lessly, and drew out the water to an
overhead tank. Locomotives halted wear
lly under the movable spout, and tenders
were supplied for the -dry miles on either !
side. j t j
The railroad wound away to the west,
tlxty miles to fVasbburn Junction, and
wandered deviously through the. north
western cattle ranges to a desolate termi
nus at Ward. From Ward a stage ran
to Altanior.t. 170 miles away. Freighters
followed the stage road down the Sweet
water to Bitter Creek Canyon, up Its
defiles to where the Stinking Fork forced
an entrance from the plains, across the
divide to Little Bear "River, and down
the river to the foothills that had to be
climbed to high-seated Altamont, on the
borders of the desert. It was a road with
plenty of water of an infinite variety.â
bad, worse, and worstâ but the way was
an unceasing up and down, wearisome
and trying, and loaded wagons took six
days to the trip, and sometimes more.
Therefore John Dubbs. otherwise known
as Desert Jack, still held to the desert*
trail. Others thought it dangerous, and
expressed themselves profanely over his
folly.
Jim Brown, better known in, the
-Â«-dges of the Escondido as Â£hiflÂ«s Jim,
r ame out of the mountains of East Ten- .
nessee. and. having for many years'
â¢wandered about the world, became at .
last a citizen of Paradise. Water was :
freÂ« and of good quality; the sand was
soft and warm, and under the, weight,
of the body and without exertion, hol
lowed itself out, making a most accom
modating bed; the sky. painted* with
etars. was a gaudy covering; a little
labor provided a sufficiency of whjsky
for a man who was not even ambitious
of continual drunkenness; and the hos
pitality of the townspeople' rendered
etarvation reasonably improbable. So
Jim concluded that on this earth he
would find no other place bo deserving
of its name. and. much to the disg-ust
of the inhabitants, announced his in
tention-of making it hie home. There
he dwelt year after year.
In the coarse of time word was taken
to the. East Tennessee mountains how. ;
JimiÃrown had settled In Paradise," and""
the report had it that he was even rich,
a respected citizen of that newsrreat'
empire of the Southwest. An old. and
lonely widow, the energetic mother ;of
that degenerate son, living a life of soli
tude in a moist and shady cove at the .
foot of a b!g: knob, bent-with tolU-trem
bling with the palsy of. age, heard the
pleasant news of her son and her heart
felt young again and she was sorely
hungered for a sight of the face of
her only child. ... \u25a0 .
The little farm that lay in, the cove,
its few stock and all its humble fur
nishings were sold and the widow made
her way to Paradise to end her days
f-fe the sunehine-of her boy* face, to
" fpend the golden sunset of life in an
earthly Eden.
But before she arrived an indignant
outburst, caused iby the unparalleled
â¢worthlessnes**of Shlfless Jim. -had led
to his reluctant departure from Para
dise, sad he had gone to Altamont. ' And*
&â¢ the train went puffing" on .its way
and left her behind, surrounded by
dingy, "stolid faces, wherein were deep-,
set, unresponsive eyes, it seemed to her
like thÂ« breaking of the last tie that had
held her to the world she had known.
6he grasped and choked and a tear
clipped out and ran down her. wrinkled,
cheelt. Bat Bhe vat a brave old. woman,
and she- gulped down her sorrow, and
held 'herself steady, save ror thc-shak-*
Ing of her palsied head, as she asked.
of one of those nearest, her, "Ain't there ,
any of you-uns as knows my boy an' ,
kin tell me where b<* Is?' â¢;
It was an old, old question In Para
dise. , ;
"Wbat'e his name?" Inquired Whisky j
Jake, whom she had addressed, taking off ,
his wide-brimmed hat and standing be-. ,
fore the widow, his head gallantly bared ,
to that Intense and burning "sun.
Whisky .was a sturdy old conservative, \u25a0
who kept a record of his own and private ,
dead by cutting notches in the stock of ,
his gun. a method of keeping booÂ«.s with
the grave which has fallen into disre- \
pute.
"Why, I'm thorely "eprised at myself," \u25a0
allowed the widow politely, her head '\u25a0
bohMng about with m:Â«;g!ed palsy and
\u25a0^excitement. "I'm shorely a-losin' of my
wit* . It's Jim Brown as I'm a-lookin'
for, little Jim as is my boy, an' a good
un. too, if I do say it, as hadn't orter."
"Ycs'm, yeK'm." answered Jake; "I
don't Just call to mind any sech around '
here. I can't think as I knowed him."
Suddenly his face brightened, he fairly
beamed upon the old woman and began
speaking rapidly, as if he feared some
oi:e else ' would be ahead of him \ with
the information.
"Oh. I remember now, mum." he said.
"I did hear as how his name was Jim
Brown." Then he turned to the* little,
crowd, so that all could share his tri-'
umph. "It's Shirâ lt's Shir " The un
fortunate nickname Ftuck in his. throat;
Inwardly he cursed himself for his awk
wardness; the rim of his hat revolved like,
c wheel between his 4uisers: he shuffled
his feet in the dust of the road and the
eweat stood out on his forehead in beady
drops.
All Paradise came to his rescue, and
without a dissenting voice lied itself into*
the lowest depths of purgatory.
"Wlij". It's Jim Brown, the lady's askin"
8 f ter," declared Three Spot. "It's old ,
Jim. as we was all so proud of. one of
the distinguished citizens of Paradise.
SbiZfly Jim, the Mexicans . called him;
'cause that means. he don't go back on :,
a friend, not never. Why. WHsky; we're
plum ashamed of ye. Miss* Brown, we're \u25a0
shorely proud to know Jim's mother." â¢ (
The strain was over, and the old ;
woman was no longer ashamed to cry.
Her rounded shoulders, curving down .
upon her sunken chest, rose and fell v as .
she fobbed.". . - . .
T!i "en Paradise did Itself proud." In :
-triumphal procession, Mrs. Brown In i
the center, the townsmen - streamed to . â¢
the hotel. The best room. was had. the :
belongings of the unfortunate occupant
trere hustled out without ceremony and. i
the -widow was Installed. All afternoon â¢
men tramped up and down the stairs
and along the wooden veranda, throng
ing the approaches and entering the
presence with a courteous deprecatory
gravity. One after another they.listen
ed with sympathetic attention to won
derful-anecdotes' of . the -childhood of
Shlf'less Jim, "and: ono after another
they, lied unblushingly,- telling how. his
maturer days. were the fitting climax
of the p'rornise of , his youth. â¢ There
were tales of; valor, stories of raunlfi-;
cence, of a kindness that was royal in.
Its - beneficence, supplying the wants of
the unfortunate -with a kingly disre
gard 'of- his. "own ."_ needs, ".traditions *- of
financial. 'success, anecdotes illustrat
ing .the shrewdness and wit of the
widow's son, all poured out with an
enthusiasm that made the old woman's
eyes snap and; sparkle and quite -took
away her breath, with pride.
She became et.hoibe with those out
casts. She took .Three Spot Charlie to
her motherly heart. and her.-^oul went
out to Cherokee Kate, whose occupa
tion was nameless, and to Mrs. O'Crool, .
who kept the hotel jand did occasional
washing for the. rest of." the* town.
These, she believed and declared, were
true ladies and. gentlemen. She \u25a0 de- ,
clared Whisky Jake was- a born noble
man, which he was not - ; and never'
claimed to be, being the soul of humil
ity when not crossed. She took those
lost ones of Paradise under her wing,'
and loved them as she had not thought
she could over love any one but her
boy Jim. ... \u25a0
And thus It was' that when John.

all its leading, citizens ..were : present.". ,' lt".'

dreaming of her boy. \u25a0 ," ...--,- .
"It'll never do in the world," declared:
Three Spot. "Some galoot'll be sure to ".
tell her, and then where'll you be?"
"I'm sure I don't know whatever -to
do," moaned Whisky. - .-' \u25a0 -. ; \u25a0
"Why don't 'you 'send "her onto 'Alta-

whispered huskily. "I'm mighty glad you

a, wise old -woman, wherefore she. said,,
nothing more to John Dubbs.
The road had disappeared ;â¢ not a mark
of wheel or a track of horse dldvthey
see on the face of the desert. But. this
was no cause of disquietude, so said tha
driver, who surely ought to know; iit
was- a common .event, ha^said.- and :< the.,
desert wayfarer was expected .to know
the details of the land. ' the location of
the springs arid the places where. : the,"
tanks lay hidden in the* hollows between x
the slopes quite aa well as if they .were*.,
marked off on the palm of his hand. For
this reason, he explained, he : drove, with
unusual rare, searching . the : earth with
seeking eyes, which thus became blood
shot and were sunken in his head until
they gleamed like coals of era ia the
black throat. of a cave.. -.
OnÂ» day John asked Mrs. Brown %o
' drink sparingly. ' : He had only .a few
hours before been* telling- how? much -less
than they .thought was the amount, of.
water consumed by thÂ« .drinking of
thirsty people, so that the vessels that
held: the lives of ; persons: shipwrecked
upon the ocean and the stores of those
who. were slns In desert place's lasted'sur- ,
prisingly | and seemed." to be- ; renawed^as
if -it- were by 'a 'miracle. And now -the
3 request â¢ was v haltingly. . made. . the ,. man' s ,
embarrassment showing guilt as" plainly
as if v he ' had' been detected In ' a petty -
theft. ' -The - widow â¢ was surprised, and,
chocked, but, .hiding her. emotion, she
promised obedience. That night "In -her
silent prayer to God she asked to 'be kept
from unjust suspicion, of-tho driver.. who
was -to her so like, a son. But for all
her efforts she believed John had begun
to grudge her thÂ« water she drank. *and
she was afraid.-. -â¢ \u0084.., ;..*i .
The next day the driver's mind, began
to wander, and ho talked la a husky
whisper,^ foolishly, \u25a0 about" springs .'that?
did- not exist, and water, holes and .tanks,
that were mere Imaginations of thÂ» brain. "
The old woman easily "called 'him 'bade'
from his '.dreams. -, which,- ho * explained;
were -caused -by .the intense heat, aggra
vated by a foolish habit hÂ» had acQUlredr
being sÂ«* much alone, of dozing' ln' the"
daytime and talking aloud- to himself. HÂ«.
was also much troubled with aa obstinate,
bleedinx of the lips, so that he was for
ever "sucking the blood' into his mouth.
and* swallowtor >It. - Because : .of. these
things the widow was much . distressed. ;
but the driver still ' smiled and snowed
eagerness to have her \u25a0 talk to him. and"
was. so \u25a0 kind and " attentive .that, she .was .
reassured and her alarm died out.
It was on the day following that one of â¢
the horses fell to- the. ground and refused
to rise. -The driver, who was sitting. on
the seat, a slack and dusty heap, coma
tose and almost breathless, was thrown
forward by the â¢ sudden halting, of ' tho
wagon, until It, was as much as the widow
could do to hold him In placeOEVhea'ahe"
shook him and called : his name he opened
his * eyes.- stared' around stupidly,- either.:
seeing nothing, or else teeing what did not .

which he tried to make loud and rollick
ins, "Well, hÂ«re wÂ© are at last, an* Tm

The widow- shook him by the. arm. but
he. made no response. .She shouted la his .
ear and \ shook' him soundly, yet still' he
did not* awake.' Then, as' she poshed 'him'
i back; and forth, his . head slipped off \u25a0 ths

4 DECORATION out of the ordi
nary, which jpive excuse 'or
maitiag a collection, was a
pitcher ruck, which one woman
had running around all four walls of her
dining room.
Tht? rack itself was more like a shelf
than a rack, made to match the wood
work, aiid braced at intervals with odd
ly carved little supports. For pitchers
are a good deal heavier than the usual
things put on racks.
Underneath the rack proper were
hooks â grood tiout onesâ which held
more pitchers.
And these pitchers presented more va
riety of kind and form and coloring
than would seem possible. Water cool
ers from Cuba and Mexico â queer
shapes, of dull, porous pottery â stood
side by side with the most' gracefully
shaped little Dresden pitchers. Oid pew
ter tankards and the tiniest of tlagons
net each other off. And beside the
most valuable of all. from a curio lov
er's standpoint, a water bottle picked
up in the Orient, stood a delicate
French pitcher, small and exquisifelv
colored and most aggressively a repre
sentation of the new world.
They represented a collection it had
taken years to acquire. "Souvenir
pitchers" had been the hobby of the
woman who turned her collection to
this novel use; and it was only because
pitchers overflowed the bounds she had
set aside for them that the idea of put
ting them to use struck her.
There's not a pictureâ not another bit
of decoration to be seen upon the walls
cf that room; yet. as no two pictures
axe alike, and as colors and shapes are

The Proper Care or the Baby
Vomiting is Not Naturalâ What it May Mean
Dr. Emelyn L. Coolidge
Copyrlett. 1935. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
X T" OMITING.or even regurgitatlon of
.\ / food, by a young infant should
Â» not be regarded as "only natu
ral," and hence no attention paid
to It; It Is not natural for a healthy
baby to vomit frequently, and, if ; he
does so, something is wrong.
-, .When a- baby vomits examine his
bands to see if they are too tight, for
If they press too much on a full stom
ach, vomltijig Is apt to be the result.
Then inquire whether he has been rocked
or danced about directly after a meal,
or sucks his fingers. If the vomiting
cannot be accounted for by any of these
causes, there is most likely something
â¢wrong with the food or the manner it
giving It. ,
If the baby vomits directly after a
meal, and the milk comes up looking
Just about as it did when it went down,
the child is probably being overfed. Re
duce the quantity given at each meal,
and, if this does not help matters, make
"the interval between each meal a little
longer.
If the vomiting takes place half an
Hour or mere after the feeding, and the
milk comes up in sour-smellins: masses,
It usually means that the child Is set
tins food too rich in cream. Use less of
the top milk or cream when making up
the foimula: or if. after trying thi?, the
vomiting still continues, leave out all of
the top milk and make the food up with
plain milk and water or gruel. A breast
fed baby who vomits or has curds in
his movMnents may be giv*;n' an ounce
cr two 3f boiled water or barley water
Just beftre he is nursed, then nursed
oxily ten or fifteen minutes, and the ln
tcr'/'ils between feedings may be mada,
a liille longer than they have been. '- ;
WHEN TO CALL THE DOCTOR""
' W'h:n the vomitinr is accompanied' "by
diarrhoea stop all milk at once and give
a teaspoonful of castor oil, then, feed
the baby on barley water until the doc
ttor comes, when his directions should
bc M fo]lowtd.
- "When there is n ; vomiting, with colic,
and the ttools contain many, curds, the
formula which Is being used is too
'strong for this particular baby. Go back
-to a formula that has been used for
one of the' previous months until one is
.found that can' be properly digested, or,
if the doctor approves, peptonize the
milk for a a>hort.time until the baby's
digestive organs become stronger. Ptp
tonizins should not be continued' any
great length-of time. .however, for, the
\u25a0 organs become so accustomed to having
their work" done for them that they will
after a Trtiile cease. to work properly for
themselves. ' '
Should the baby reject his food with
great force," or have whatÂ» Is called

Ing, with hot water and a, pinch , of bi
carbonate of soda, will often help the
child more than anything else that can
possibly be done, and if the doctor
wishes to do this the mother. should not
be alarmed or make any objection, for
the operation is entirely painless and a
very simple one to perform. ' It -will

Many otherwise pretty babies are made
ugly by 'the "fact that their .cars stand
out from their heads a considerable dis
tance. While .the child is i very young 'is
the time, if ever, to correct this trou
ble. A skeleton cap especially made for
this purpose may be bought in a chil
dren's clothing store y in; New York city
for $1.25, or. If the mother is ; unable to
procure one of these, she may make one
herself out of thin lawn or -pieces of
broad tape, but In order to do any good
it must fit very snugly and be worn, for

A Screen for Photos
SOME of the cleverest ways of dis
posing of fine photographs have
been devised.. For it's no. longer
the fashion to keep them hidden. away
in cabinets for the mere joy of '-posses
sion. William Morris* ' theories are ; be
coming more and more widespread, es-;
lieclally. the one which demands a use
for everything that is about. 'V *
,t, t A plain wooden screen was called upon
to create. one of these uses for photo
graphs.': Tho wood Vwas stained; a dull
brownâ one of the innumerable; Flemish
finishes. At, the top of each panel was
mounted a fine photograph, all in warm
brown tones that harmonized rcstfully
â¢wlthr the* wood. ; â¢
The photographs were covered with
glass," and \u25a0 around each ran ; a narrow
moulding, stained to" match the "wood
exactly. V /'.-'â¢
Those .photographs ..were^ /.-'almost
square; but the came idea could be car
ried butVwlth : theVtall,.; narrow^ photo

WAYS OF EARNING MONEY -- -MILLINERY

Invitations by telephone are not oot>
sidered very good form, and should hm
resorted to only on the most informal
occasions.
It Is' perfectly correct to send bat ovtm
Invitation to both husband and -wife.
If this is an engraved card to a lan*
dinner, dance or recaption. ; all' that Is
necessary, If It Is one- of the sort that
â¢â¢requests the pleasure of your com
pany," Is to address the envelope to
"Mr. and Mrs. James Gray." If the
card '\u25a0 Is of the style that require* " the
names written In. then, of course, the
names "Mr. and Mrs.. James Gray", are
written In -on the blank line and .the
envelope addressed to both' husband and
wife. "An invitation on a visiting card
can : have < the envelope addressed ' "Mr.
and ' Mrs.'," but 'when â the Invitation
takes the form of a note written In the
first person It should be addressed on
the envelope to ; the .wife.-"; The not*
would begin something like this:
My Dear Mrs. Brown:
Will you and i your husband (or "you
and . Mr. Brown" ; either < form ' Is cor
rect) dine with, us next Thursday even-
Ing, March the fifteenth, at half -past
six Cordially yours, .
."â¢â¢/; Margaret .White.
One Invitation can also be sent to two
or more sis tes, in which "case It should
be addressed "The Misses Brown," but
must never be sent to two , brothers.
Bachelors always require separate invi
tations. It is not considered in good
taste to make * one Invitation Include a
whole family, as Is sometimes done.
Society considers it decidedly' a breach
of etiquette to address an "envelope; "Mr.
and Mrs. Brown and Family.*.' \

[BUDAPEST, Sept. 9.â Three weeks
ago strange and sensational rumors
were in circulation regarding a roman
tic affair which was said to have taken
place in the neighborhood of Gross
trardein in which a youthful nobleman
and a fascinating young lady were said
to have played the principal parts. In
quiries were immediately instituted by
the Hungarian papers and several of
them now publish details of the affair,
which tarns out to be as romantic as
any cne could wish. The reports pub
lished ia different newspapers vary in
some details, but they agree regarding
the main outlines, so that the follow
ing particular* may be accepted as au
thentic:
The hero cf this romance is Count Sig
irmurd Zendovsky, aged 23, heir to one
cf the foremost aristocratic positions
in Hungary. The wonderful doings of
- his warlike ancestors were first chron
icled by the monks of the eleventh cen
tury and ever since that remote period
the Zendovsky family has occupied a
prominent place in Hungarian history.
The Zendovsky family possesses vast
estates in Transylvania and in the re
mote northeastern provinces of Hun
gary, which yield an annual revenue
of many thousands of dollars. Their
three ancestral castle* â one situated in
Transylvania, another high up among
the Carpathian Mountains and a third
ia Croatiaâ are among the oldest medi
eval bsildlsg* ia -existence ia Europe.
Life oa their estates It carried on In
the old fea&al style and the head of the
family exact* from his retainers those
marks of respect, which nowadays are
usually reserved for royal personages.
Above everythiag It has become a point
cf honor ia the family to maintain the
purity of the blue blood created by
nine centuries of aristocratic aacestors,
s.nd there is a family- tradition handed
down from the sixteenth century that
a. terrible curse will blight the whole
clan of the Zeadovskys when one of
the scions of the house contracts a
marriage with a person of unaoble
birth.
Count Eiglsnv.ind Zendovsky was
brought up with great. care to respect
all these family traditions. At the age
of 18 he was sent to the University of
Budapest and at the expiration of his
three years' period of study he was
recalled home to undergo a course of
training in the administration of the
ancestral estates.
DAUGHTER OF A PEDDLER. -
It was in the vicinity of his "father's
estate of Kesmetecetcsy, on the borders .
cf Transylvania, that be met the hero
ine of this romance. Miss Irene Xanson.
A greater contrast than that between
Count Sigismund Zendovsky and Miss
Irene Xanson can hardly be conceived.
Miss Xanson's parents were Galician
Jews, who emigrated to America. Her
father began life as a street peddler at
Leraberg and her mother was. the ;
daughter of a Jewish grave-digger. I
Her parents emigrated and settled in '
New York and Miss Irene Xaason was j
born in Hobo ken twenty-five years ago."!
Her father never rose higher than to i
b<; a petty storekeeper. Irene, how- j
ever, was a pushjng and ambitious girl ;
and neglected no opportunity of edu- \
- eating herself for a higher sphere of'
activity. She was the only child and i
after her parents* death, two or three I
9 years ago. there were no ties . to bind ]
her to America, so she came over to ;
Europe to earn her living as an English j
governess. \
After holding- one position in Ger
many and another in Austria she came '
nearly a year ago to act as governess I
in the house of a Hungarian gentleman j
aansed Zoltan Xakocsi, whose residence
The San Francisco Call.
is situated in the vicinity of the Zen- i
dovsky â¢family estate of Ke3znetecet-'
csy. Count Sigismund Zendovsky met
Miss Xanson for the first time on the
occasion of a visit which he paid to i
the Xakocsl family toward the end of
last year and she immediately attract
ed his attention and interest.- Miss
Xanson is a typical Oriental beauty
â¢with prominent features, dark com
plexion, black flashing eyes. Jet black
hair and a full rounded imposing fig
ure. The young Count fell in' love -with
her at first sight and ; soon contrived;
to convey to her an Intimation of - his ;
feelings. The penniless governess wa3 ;
pleased_and flattered by his attentions i
and secret communication was soon es- i
tablished between the two lovers. ;
One day they were seen together and j
the inevitable consequences ensued.*;
Miss Xanson was ejected from her situ- \
ation and Count Sigismund Zendovsky j
informed his father that he intended to !
marry her. The effect' of . this declara
tion may be well imagined. Count j
Zendovsky, senior, was enraged beyond i
measure and took energetic steps
to prevent his son from, committing
what he Considered to be a colossal act
of folly If not a crime. Misa. Xanson
took up her quarters â¢in a cottage : be
longing to a peasant in the neighbor
hood, who waa heavily bribed by Count
Sigismund. to admit his sweetheart as a
lodger.
COVKTS CRUEL. FATHER. i
Count Zendovsy, senior, first applied
to the police to expel Miss Xanson from
the country as an. undesirable ; alien,
and when ha was informed - that this
could not be done without /legal
grounds the old aria tocrat instituted
systematic inquiries with a" view 7to
finding out ' something, discreditable
about the American girl. . In this ,he
failed. Finding . that it was .Impossible
to expel her he approached the peasant
and offered him a heavy bribe .to jsject
her from her- lodgings. The \ peasant,
seeing an opportunity of -. doing/good
business reported the father's offer ' to
the son and the two counts outbid. one
another successively, for a ,. Time * until
Count Sigismund found that he -\could
not outbid bis father . and . Miss ' Xanson
was ejected from her lodgings. .The
old! Count exerted _his- -rinfluence
throughout the whole neighborhood : to
prevent Miss Xanson from finding j ac
commodation and ultimately she was
obliged to beat a retreat and went .to
Budapest . to await developments."
This dispute culminated In \u25a0< bitter
hatred between father and son, and
open war was declared between" 1 them.
Count Sigismund left his home and
proceeded . to Budapest with the de
clared object of making the necessary
arrangements for his marriage. Count
Zendovsky, senior, cut off his allow
ance, so that Count Sigismund was "re
duced to absolute penury. Hisposi
tlon and expectations, however, "enabled
him to borrow" almost any amount of
money . from the usurers 'at Budapest,
for the Zendovsky estates are all en
tailed "and must one day pass* to the
eldest soii . Irrespective of the : father's
likes and dislikes.
HE IS -TAKEX PRISONER^^S^
As Count Sigismund was of age there
was no way of legally preventing his
marriage and lii these circumstances
Count Zendovsfcy, senior. - resolved vto
resort' to .forcible measures. -With .tat

aid of detectives he was kept Informed
regarding ! tile .progress of the j prepara
tions j for. the' marriage and arranged
that the blow j should fall suddenly and
dramatically, at the~ last ' moment. V.
On- the. eve of the wedding "Count
Sigismund was walking homer. toward
midnight when he was .waylaid *in t a
quiet street; and quickly gagged before
he could ahout for. help. He ;was-then
bound ; tightly, and , removed .f rom 7 ? the"
railway train . to /the ; ancestral ; castle
of \ his r family, , situated ; - in the "\u25a0:- Carpa-"
thiana. T On arrival at the castle he waa
Imprisoned* In a chamber at^ the very
top of "one of ' the round \ towers -which
adorn the building.-; Here he ; was 120
feet above theground, so there was no
apparent outlet In that ', direction. â¢%, The
round chamber was well lighted by five
windows, 'all; of which -were -guarded
by thick Iron bars firmly embedded [In
the masonry of the. walls. .: The . only
access to tha chamber was by means of
a marrowr narrow > circular "staircase f not t^wlde
enough for : \u25a0 two " . persons :to stand
abreast. - 'Count Sigismund " wwa s told
that he would be~ required to J marry a
lady whom Count Zendovsky, " senior,
had chosen to 'be â¢ his ; wife. * The mar
riage would have to be :\u25a0\u25a0; celebrated
within the 'castle In; which he '.was im
prisoned,, and *' not until \u25a0 'the wedding
was . over ,would Ihe - regain '; his / liberty.
If he agreed to; these terms his father
wasvwilling to pay Miss : Xanson's ' fare
across thfe Atlantic and" a sum of ? ! j 15,
000 wherewithâshe could begin' life
again! in 'America.;: Count Sigismund
promptly, -rejected,., these;-. propositions
and so he remained a prisoner in'; the
turret 'Among the ; retainers
was a, man who /could not. withhold :hls
sympathy '; from' the * young '> lovers j "and
allowed himself to be enticed by Count
Sigismund ; Into "; forwarding ,*a "letter *to
Miss . Xanson "atj Budapest.^. In" this t let
ter ' Count Siglsmund ; Informed -her"; of
his whereabouts, and explained that : If
another/ wayj of j escape : could Â» be plan
ned he L would prefer,.that the; matter
should not j be; made" public because" he
feared i that .: the I storyXbf ( . his ;, capture
and imprisonment*.\wouldj make '.. him 1 ? a
ridiculous 7 figure "lnithe eyes of all-his

\u25a0;';\u25a0 Miss r Xanson fully : appreciated - this

BERLXX, Sept- 9. â Considerable ex
citement has been caused in the town
of Duilsburg. in Prussia, by the trial of
two "sorcerers." â¢ a man and a woman,
self-styled "professar3 of "the black
art." who extracted large sums of
money from credulous persons by
"raising the devil" with all manner of
mysterious rites.
The premises *on which the opera
tions were conducted were fantastical
ly decorated with strange wooden Bg
ures. stuffed snakes and owls, and
weird inscriptions on the walls.
The client was brought into a dimly
lit room, thick with the odors of evil
smelling- herbs and sulphur. The sor
ceress, draped In black and scarlet
robea. glided In. As she entered. her
confederate disappeared and the cere
mony began.
Long: Incantations were jase
through, and a mystic appeal wu la
timateljr made to the Inhabitants of the
lower world. After a long silence, th*
appeal was answered in a high-pitched
tenor voice by a song of the Prtnca
of Darkness pronouncing the destiny aZ
the -client. The Interview closed with
the anointing of the victim wtth a
salve warranted to preserve Mia from
sickness and disease tor all time. This
small boon \u25a0was granted for sums oi
from 12 cents te $23, according to tha
appearance of the client.
The sorceress, whose nan* Is Sibsles.
and his Satanic Majesty, who was
christened Bonne, were shown ta bÂ«
Impostors In a curiou3 manner. Bonne
was engaged to, sing at a local concert.
His performance was but half finished,
when an agitated member of tit* an
dience rose . and announced htzx as
Satin, with" tha result 1 that both tha
impostors wera arrested - aid cut on
trial. They have now been sentenced
to three years* Imprisonment each.. -

Signor Polacco fays tint we are very
"cxigcant." This, with shrugged shoul
ders, protesting pa'.ms. vycbrovrs ' lifted to
cur unrcascrabioncss. is Italian for
"wanting t!.c earlb-V At least it would
be U it were Kot French. Which is aiot
Infrequently Uie way Polacco arrives at
his Englishâ not so mention short cuts by
the German route!
Laughing, what in a woman would
be pouting, iit these terrible Americans
â¢who want so much, the conductor pro-,
tested: "You want everything in the
t:rgci5 â youth, fine face, fine figure, beau
tiful voice, temperamentâ everything you
want."
'That is why we get it," I explained.
"It Is perhaps true!" Polacco acknowl
edged, then asain at It: "In Italy now
if we have the art, the voice, we do not
xr.ind if the sinscr looks like aâ what you
coil the big. blue beast of Barnum?"
â¢\u25a0Elephant"â l supplied. ...>â¢;\u25a0
Ke annexed the word with a laughing
nod. and added:: "Nor if they are like a
little codfishâ eh?" â¢'Shrimp." I am sure
Sigaor Polacco intended.
I had gone over to the Tivoli to chat
vrtth last season's Idol of the conductor's
desk. More enthusiastic than ever, if
that were possible, the same passionate
reverent artiet. 1 found him. Incident
ally, there was much more of Polacco's
youthful cheek, clear as a girl's, than'
before, loot of his long holiday. The
conductor was supremely happy over the
prospects of the season. The Tivoli man
agement. "Doc" Leahy, to whom grand
opera is as mother's milk, have given
Polacco the best tools of his art. A com
pany such as has never before gathered
at the Tivoli is to his hand. An orches
tra, picked, \u25a0winnowed, lavishly chosen,
Â»-Ith a harpist, Mme. Morreale, brought
from New York; a splendid new bassoon
ist, and all the best of the local genius,
le at his bidding. 1 heard them the othtr
morning, swinging through the new
"Trovatore" that Polacco is to give in
this season, and understood somewhat of
his enthusiasm. The chorus Is in keeping,
large, handsome and splendidly voiced.
Then Max Freeman has charee of the
aesthetics, which will Insure us the loss
of the oiebald Aidas and such like ec
centrics, and the gain of everything
ecenlcally desirable.
That the "aesthetlk" of "11 Trovatore"
\u25a0would be as Kood as the music Polacco
had begun by saying. The company is
all things the "exlgeant" Americans
would have. "II Trovatore" from the
American standpoint as it was seen givtn
at La Scala last seassn, with tremendous
success, fourteen performances during
the season, he described.
"Not too much, to say, it if," recounted
Poiacco, "that Leonora weighed 225
pounds. She was like this." Polacco's
r-lbows shot out to their limit , to indicate
the soprano's circumference. "She was
like a â a barrel, like a woman to carry
cannon at circus. And the tenor he was
likeâ as tall as this." Four feet the Po
lacco hand lifted from the floor, "and as
ihln asâ your pencil! But they singâ and
\\f> do nut mind."
Unregenerate. I said I liked '.our way
bf-st; then asked the conductor something
of what he hopÂ«d to do with "II Trova
tore."
"Ah, that is of my heart!" the conduc
tor exclaimed, and to be quiet at the
talk wo -went through the dim theater to
Po'acco's 'own sma.ii' den. " On ~ the" way
Grcgoretti flashed his white teeth at us,
boomed a careful. . Jovely barytone
"Good-a morning," and went on to plant
a large, delighted. Italian kiss on Gretch
en's cheek â Gretchen, the wardrobe wom
an, who thinks there is no barytone quite
like Grtgorettl. who thinks there Is no
wardrobe woman quite like Gretchen!
And Gretchen should know, 6he thinks.
She "dressed" him. and Ischlerdo, his
friend, "her boys" all the season they
wÂ»=re nere. . ,-. .. ;v\
Polacco began, "It is, after all. but lit
tle that I hope to do with 'Trovatore'â
only to give it as Verdi Intended! But
so. I tell you. it Is new opera. It-has been
assassinated very long, turned out of bar
rel organs like sausages. You know"â
*.he Polacco right forefinger went to his
nose, laid alongside its sensitive line in
the funny little fashion In which Po
lacco accents hie talk, "in the old scores
there Is not' sufficient indication of th
tempos. Careless conductors have changed
them, commonplacedâ lt Is English?â
them. In the soorÂ« psrhaps, would be
'peco plu mosso/~they would -make of it
a gallop. You know in the third act.
Azucena's beautiful little melody in three
quarter time? I have heard this, In gTeat
theater, taken Just as a. waltz.*.' \u25a0
I don't know if my horror camÂ«* up to
Polacco'* expectations. But I did my best.
It was ac If he had said that he had heard
!'Ma Ragtime Baby" In St. Peter's.
"We. of the younger school." he went
en, "have the conscience to try to restore
the true traditions of the opera. 'ReprlÃ

Signor Poiacco , then commandtd that 1

for the prologue,- "a splendid page. You
shall see new action. I will rehtarse the

to do the proud chorus lady, waving a
stiff little fingtr. to prove hcrailvc. *'I
wii! uot have them as little soldiers of

"Like your beautiful chorus last sea

"Oh." Polacco laughed.: "it is true they
were museum freaksâ ehl archeological
curiosities, prehistoric! 'No! This year I
have fine chorusâ American chorus. They
are- very quirk, intelligent. Just now
they were rehearsing *Manon \u25a0 Lescaut."

Reâ markable."'. . ' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.\u25a0.-.
I told him that, the "Manon. Lescaut"
was a novelty, that it had been only, orlce
presented here, before, by the little Del
Conti Company to whom we owe our tirst
"La Bohtme." - ...
Of It Polacco believes that "it is the
only work of Puccini's that was writ
ten without an eye to the public. It
has been saia." he remarked, "that for
Its period the music is too .meridionals
â passionate, dramatic. Not -for me. It
is. true it was a time of frivolity, pou
dre, patents, but for me it is very
ambiente, full of treasures of the heart
and sentiment, not at all too dramatic
for the story." *.V '.'"
"It is much heavier music than the
'Manon' of Massenet," 1 suggested.
"Yes, and its people you love them
more; you 6ufTer more wun them; they
are moreâ more human. When the
public goes home the people go home
â¢with him. the images of Manon and
Dcs Grieux. It Is an incision â how ' say
you 'incise'?â cut into the heart."
.That the Del Conti "Manon Lescaut"
had been given with "apocryphal instru
mentation" Polacco surmised, was glad to
think that next Wednesday he would
give it to us in Puccini's own beauti
ful orchestral wording.
"Very . dramatic," he says, is Cilea's
"Adrienne Lecouvreur" that is to be
given here for the first time this sea
son. "Most pure artist of all the liv
ing Italian composers," Polacco stamps
Cilea. "He Is not -avid of glory, is all
for -art," he says. "His genius is not
perhaps so rich in inspiration, but pol
ished and elegant."- personally the con
ductor prefers Cilea's "L'Arleslenne."
that he was the first to conduct. By
the public it -has not been so well re
ceived;' "too sad," 'Polacco explains.
Various 'samples of choral feminine
pulchritude -kept - swishing, by, j with a
"by. your leave," and ' as one even come
lerthan even the comely crowd wished
her "how dye do" 'to "us Polacco re
turned to his grievance. Again he ac
cused the Americans of. unreasonable
ness, said that- in Italy they "knew
that artists 'did not -spring up in a
night \u25a0 like champignonsâ -mushrooms?
â oh, yes." Particularly now, he added.
"How .so?'* I -asked.
"There- is, great degeneration, deca
dence â you have the word?â among the
singers," the conductor alleged. "The
standard is .very low among them at
present;" â¢ .- - . \u25a0 "\u25a0, \u25a0â¢
' "So?" I queried, "and to what. do you
attribute it"â Wagner "and the music
drama I' did not dare to sdggest. For
when- it -is- not- Beethoven. Polacco is
worshiping he is pouring libations to
Wagner. 7 "Was It that singers did riot
study enough?" I asked. <
"They \u25a0 don't study' at -all,"- the con
ductor put it. Then he returned to. his
delight in the company that has. been
gathered together for this season: Of
It one can say In preface that Polacco
is satisfied. In San Francisco nothing
more need be said.
His clear brown eyes â¢ flashed all
kinds of artist joy. In" the prospect. "I
can workâ "work" should be \ln great

programme of music and pantomime done
by Harvey Worthington Loomis and Ed
win Star Belknap. Those familiar with
the Wa-Wan press publications will know
Mr. . Loomis' work. He is of the new
Americans, and has much that is inter
esting to say, particularly in his transla
tions to -the sophisticated ear of the na
tive Indian music. The * programme will
include songs, pianoforte works, studies

other compositions. Mr. Belknap will have

Harrison Grey Flske spent some time
in Paris during his recent. trip abroad,
and. -of course, studied theatrical con
ditions at the French capital. He noted
a very unsatisfactory season in that
city, there having been but one or two
notably successful/plays. From what
he saw and heard the French drama is
at a very low ebb. "Comparatively."
says Mr. Flske. "the New York theaters
are vast Improvements on the Paris
theaters as regards safety, comfort and
beauty in front of the. house. Produc
tions here, too, are far superior to their
productions. The chief point in which
the theater in Paris excels is the act
ing. There the most minute attention
is paid to the smallest details and the
minor parts are played quite as well as
the principal parts. In the musical the
aters of Paris many points of inferior
ity are seen in comparison with the
musical theaters and their pieces here.
Scenery, costumes and even the music
are all inferior to ours. Imagine, if you
can, for instance, a scene purporting to
show a sumptuous drawing-room in a
club with a cut-glass chandelier repre
sented by a piece of flat painted 'pro
file.* the lights themselves being simu
lated by round pieces of oiled paper. A
feast in the same play, to which a party
of men and women sit down, shows an
appetizing array of chickens, fruits.
etc.. v made of flat, painted pasteboard!
It is needless to speculate on the re
sults of such representations in a pre
tentious musical piece in this country.

THE MAID
AND
THE HORSE
PRESIDENT OF WASHINGTON'S FEDERATED CLUBS, A WINSOME; BIIIDI2 AND ONE OF THE HOSTESSES OF THE WEEK.
Hale little maiden!.
You're riding astride, and it has become
passe.
Of course, you didn't know it, or you
wouldn't have done it, because to be passe
is to be impossibleâ in society. There are
only a few smart set maids who have the
courage to follow their own tastes in ex
ternals.
There , aren't ' many girls like Alice
Roosevelt and Ethel Hager. who do as
they pleaseâ in externals, of course â and
they are refreshing. They don't set any
cane laws of propriety at defiance, but
they do and say -things with \u25a0 charming
frankness.'
But back -to the new edict â that of rid
ing with a side-saddle. *.
The promulgation has gone forth from
the riding teachers of Gotham, who con
ferred with physicians as to the merits of
man's saddle and tie Fide-saddle.
AftÂ«>r profound discussions and learned
dissertations it was agreed that from a
physical standpoint the Eide-eaddle had
far the best of it. Now that, I think, is
rather a new decision, it tegering some
where in my mind that the physical su
periority of ridng astride has been its
chief defense.
Surely no one will openly confess to
thinking it more attractive than the'elde-
Kaddle, when the lines' of a woman's fig
ure and costume are undulating and
graceful. â¢
The same cannot be said of the man's
saddle and "the accompanying -rig where
good horsemanship is the centralizing fea
ture.
To be sure, you will rebel at the upset
ting of the "new woman" idea of rldlng-i
ridlng Just like a man. It will,' of course.
Jar you a little, especially if you have a
new nkirt built for astride riding-and.au
angular figure.
Bu. if you have all the curves harassed
nature intended for; you and you-, don't
E*t the shivers at ci vine tha man's sad-
dle skirt to the poor, instruct your tailor
to get busy. upon a new skirt, ask papa
for 'a new side-saddle and sally forth to
the blest breezes of the beach' in tho
fashion nature built you to .ride.
And these are the doctor's orders.
-â¢--â¢- â¢_..... .... .
At last! At last! .
Well, last winter we-all prophesied that
the waltz was doomed.'
In fact, many of us feel .almost Justi
fiedâalmost, I repeatâ in saying' "I told
you so." For at t^e big dances last sea
son the waltz was danced principally -by
the lumpy belles and the fat beauxâ lt
doesn't require so much breath.
The young things. 'the quick, danced the
two-step to everything, be it waltz, schot
tische; polka, or a dead march.* Every
thing was a two-step,- with. the exception
of the aforesaid fat partfss." -,
Now comes the American Society, of the
American Dancing Professorsâ not.;teach
ers, 'nor instructors/ but "professors"â
who "declare officially* that the "Waltz ;is
decrepid, wobbly, and is fast passing into
the glcom of yesteryear." And all; for that
mad, feverish ' gallop-to-get-somewhere,
and never getting there-^the two-step. -;
It Is said , to be in line with everything
else we Americans do, the maddest people
in the world to :be : in"; action, verbal -or
physical, \u25a0 sometimes mental.
But the '. aforesaid ""professors"*, have
determined to ;' resuscitate . the , waltzâ the
exquisite ; grace of' motionâ to' ita^ proper
etation among ; the prescribed , modes Â»of
motion. .They say they will not let it die.,
And in at' s just what Jolly : Ned : Green
way says-^-the ' waltz /must \u25a0 not ; die. y And
to make good hiscommand, he : will have
the vraltz upon :â¢ his \ dance . programmes
this winter, just: as of -yore." :.- \u25a0 -

THE JAPANESE MOBS.
IT is not likely that any very serious situation will develop out.
of the mobs and riots in Tokio, unless they should overawe the
Mikado into refusing to sign the treaty. That would ring the
death kncl! of japan. The feeling that has been, behind the dis
turbance is the national spirit that for ages has put the Soldier and
the art of war first among national concerns. This spirit, loving
war and its spoils, has magnified the military power of the empire
until it eclipses everything else.
The leaders who are jusing this sentiment as a political mo
tive are acting in opposition to everything that has made the new
â¢ Japan. Ever since the civil war which broke the power of the Dai
ir.ios japan has been guided by her sages, statesmen, diplomats, men
of science and political economists. These have shown wisdom
that makes them peers of any in their class of any race or country.
They were willing to make war for the national life, for self-preser
vation, for the position which new Japan should occupy in Eastern
Asia, and they were willing to make peace when -these ends were
attained. They weighed at their real importance the gains that
were made by fighting, and they secured them by a timely treaty,
honorable to themselves and to their country.
In Japan there are sordid people, as in every other nation, who
can see only the things of the moment and not those of the future.
They but little comprehend the diplomacy that puts their country
among the powers of the world, or the enormous value to Japan of
the respect and confidence of the nations. They see war as the only
occupation worth considering, and taking advantage of the national
spirit which puts the soldier first and the merchant and producer
last, they have in effect started a reactionary movement which
would put Japan back where Commodore Perry found her.
On the other hand, the sages and statesmen see that the coun
try, while kept ready for defense, must cease putting the soldier
first and must from this time on lift trade, finance and production
to their proper place in the national economy. Men like Ito and
Komura see clearly that the commercial future of Japan, with
Korea open to her control and China to her influence, means im
measurably more than any indemnity that could have been taken
from Russia even if all Siberia had been overrun by the Japanese
armies. The leaders of the mob are madmen and not statesmen.
They, are leading their country into the pit from which no army
and no general could dig her again.
Japanese statesmanship having wrought such wonders of ad
vancement, we are persuaded that it will not fail now. The Mikado
is known to be anything but a puppet, moved by those around him.
Whiie he maintains the Oriental state that is necessary to command
the respect of the masses, he is known to be keenly intelligent and
well informed in international affairs. He knows the two groups
of politicians in his empire, and realizes that a revolution now would
be promoted by the feudal lords who were disarmed by the civil
war of forty years ago. If successful, such a revolution would re
store, as his rival in power, the spiritual head of the empire. The
dual dynasty and the feudal system, and the soldier as first in all
things, held Japan to her ancient moorings. To return to \u25a0.them
now would be as great a reversal as to plunge Europe into the
midst of the dark ages.
That will not be done. The treaty will be ratified and the dis
turbance will subside. There will be action and reaction between
China and Japan. China will teach the island empire to haye 1
proper respect for, and give proper place to, commerce and the
merchant. In turn China will learn from Japan the principles of
honor in government and the need of proper equipment for defense
without making war the master motive of the people.
In treating the question in this country it is well to remember,
that we have felt the demoralization of war, and that it has been
expressed in m&bs and riots. The draft riots in New York during
our civil war. which were nothing less than an uprising against
the National Government, far exceeded in slaughter and serious
ness anything tha^ has so far occurred in Japan. In the formative
stages of our Government we had the whisky rebellion and other
revolts against public policy and authority, and finally the Civil War
itself. But our national life and our representative institutions sur
vived them all. We should therefore be patient with Japan, remem
bering our own past and the faults and follies of leaders who were
themselves misled by passion and ambition.
It is a study for the thoughtful that both Russia and Japan,
so recently embattled against each other, are now occupied by
serious civil disturbances at home. Of the two, Russia is in the
more serious plight because of the insufficient intelligence of her
people and the character of her government. Americans wish well
to the people of both empires, that they may enlarge and appre
ciate the rights of man, and the solemn responsibility imposed by
international obligations. . .
DOMESTIC FINANCE AND CONSUMPTION.
SECRETARY METCALF has issued the statistical abstract
for the year 1904. It shows the national debt at $11 83 per
capita and the interest at 30 cents. The total expenses of ,the
Federal Government are $7 n per capita. The money in the'
country was $34 29 per capita. The exports were $17 87. Of our
agricultural exports, cotton was 60 per cent, wheat 18 per cent,
crude mineral oil 25 per cent.
The extent of the home consumption per capita is especially in
teresting, as showing the percentage of surplus remaining for . ex
port. We retained for home consumption per capita, of cotton 25
pounds, of wheat 6 bushels, of corn and corn meal 26 bushels/ of
sugar 75 pounds;. we consumed of coffee 11 pounds, of tea 1 pound.
Oiu- spirit bill was not very heavy, for we consumed per capita of
distilled spirits a gallon and a half, malt liquors 18 gallons, and
wines only half a gallon. It is rather' remarkable that we each
drank only one gallon more of whisky than we did of wine. The
vintner seems to be gradually overtaking the distiller. Of wool we
consumed each five and a half pounds, of which V 7 per cent was
foreign wool.
The revenues of the postoffice were Si 76 per capita, the cost
was Si 86. We each therefore had to pay 10 cents out of our
pockets to keep the mails going. Our public schools cost us $11 \u25a010
per capita of the population of school age. -
The immigration for the year was 58 per cent of the total in
crease in population. This is a portentous fact. We are getting
more increase by immigration than by native births.
Our imports of merchandise for consumption were $12 02 per
capita. There is food for reflection that only \u25a0' 10 per cent- of our
foreign trade, exports and imports, was carried on American ships.
In IS7I American ships carried 31 per cent and the decline has been
steady from that time until 1901, when it fell to 8 per cent. The
small rise in 1904 is perhaps accounted for by an increase of 3, per
cent in American tonnage on deep water. The population of "Cali
fornia per square mile was g, that of Massachusetts- 348. The
densest population in the Union is in the District of Columbia, 4645
per square mile, but it is practically all a city population and cannot
be compared fairly with the totals of States 'which include urban
and rural both.
The clearing-house exchanges for the Pacific States were $2,
920,770,740, of which San Francisco had $1,513,927,257. or more
than half. Our imports from countries which are now threatening
'cur trade by differential tariffs were: From Germany, $169488,554:
from France, 881,410,347: Italy, $33,158,042; Spain,^ $8,346,173â a
total of $232,103,116. Our exports to the same countries were
$350,542,817. The, apparent balance of trade against them is the
reason for their proposed tariff war, on the. result of which hangs
the fate of a total international trade of $582,645,933.
The imports .and exports at San Francisco were " 537,542,978^
THE SAX FRANCISCO' CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER, 10. 1905.
UNCLE|SAM--THE PEN'S MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD, SERGE-EH?
A RESEMBLANCE
Jacob Rils. the sociologist, in an ad
dress to a workingmen's : club, praised
generosity. \u25a0> \u0084 r . â¢
"I see a handful . of children here,"
he said. "May they grow up generous.
May none of them grow up into such
a man as an old banker whom I know.
"He Is a millionaire banker, and he
lives in a palace, but his heart is hard
as steel and as cold as ice.
"One of his men completed the other
day his twenty-fifth - year of service.
For twenty-five years this honest man
had' worked for the banker faithfully.
He and his chief were "both poor at the
beginning, but where, in the quarter
century, the banker had accumulated
a few millions, the faithful, middle
aged bookkeeper has only accumulated
a few hundreds. His salary, you see,
was only $26 a 'week.
"He didn't think the banker would
remember the twenty-fifth anniversary
of his engagement, but the ; old man
did. That morning he handed" the book
keeper a sealed envelope.
" 'George,' he said, 'to-day ends the
twenty-fifth year of your work for me.
and you have worked steadily and well.
In this envelope is a memento" of the
occasion.'
"The bookkeeper opened the envelope,
trembling and eager. Within lay his
employer's photograph. That was' all.
"In the face of a disappointment
so bitter the poor fellow could say
nothing.
" 'Well,' asked the banker, 'what do
you think of it?' *
" 'It's just like you,' said the book
keeper simply."
and the duty; paid \ras $7,304,^85. ,The imports and 'exports' at 'this
port were highest in .; 1891, . being then â¢ $60,943,299/; but \u25a0 the duty^ col
lected was $7,648,752, only a little more, than last year on a smaller"
volume of trade. Our volume cbi' -trade -has been rising since. 1901,
but the duty collected fluctuates as the quantity of free imports rises
and falls. -> . .'' . ;./. â¢
Of course we are able to give only the slightest, extracts from
this volume;; \u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0lt should.be in the hands: of -all mercnants:and busi
ness men, and of all public men: who have; to do with the economic
policies of the country. Secretary Metcalf's department^has been
the first to put. all of these statistical facts an shape for convenient
study, and the book" in which .they 1 appear - should be in all our
I public libraries : where it will be; accessible. A great many crude
notions and economic theories are' washed out by a shower bath of
exact figures. The impression Idrie^ gains. from a study of : .tlie facts
is that trade and production ' follow certain . lines fixed by. natural
laws, and that legislation can db';little more than systematize the
processes by which they operate. 'â¢"
ROOM IN CITIES.
AT the formal ; opening of; the : new Postoffice arid -. Federal Court
building in San Francisco the nobility of the structure as to
its exterior and interior inspired the eloquence of every
speaker. But this was tinged by regret. The splendid structure is
crowded.: It is not ; set in sufficient space. It is not visible in proper
perspective. The ' speakers all agreed 'that the site is propery the
location good, but that the obstructing property from to
Market street should have been bought and cleared" by the .Gov
ernment so as to permit 'the needed perspective. This is a case
of hindsight. It ought to have been done; but was riot. The city
sold the. space in front of the new City Hall, and that building- in
like manner, suffers ;for -lack of - ,
Cities as they grow old and; great have occasion to \u25a0.'.lament as

MOST of the millionaires of to-day
. married on what would now be
called a pittance. : It is not prob
able that any of these marriages
were contracted as financial Investments.
When it is considered, however, the num
ber of times I the wealth of some of the
rich men" of ' to-day has doubled Itself
from the astonishingly small sums with
which they ventured into matrimony it
would indicate an investment of good
financial possibilities as well as those of
happiness, ; writes G. R. Clarke in the
Chicago Tribune. :
F.H. Cooper, married on $10 a week.
He came -to "the United States about
thirty-five | years "ago. He started in life
as a clerk. at $8 a week in the employ of
Adam, Meldrum & Anderson in Buffalo,
N. Y. A year later, when his salary was
increased to $10, he was married. J>uring
the next four years, during which he
worked for the same firm, the young
couple saved $1500. With this he with
drew and went into business for himself,
the firm for which he had worked grant
ing, him a reasonable credit.
KEEXE'S COURTSHIP STORMY.
The experiences of James R. Keene
would make a thrilling; chapter of "How
to succeed, though married.'^ He aspired
to the hand of a Virginia belle whom he
had met: while she was visiting her broth
er, Judge William P. Daingerfield of Cali
fornia.-When he made his first successful
venture with Flood and O'Brien in the
speculative world, he began his wooing,
which was bitterly opposed by the young
woman's brother. The ' comparatively
small amount of money he had made in
speculation did not make up with this
family i for the fact that he was a "curb
stone, broker."
Young Keene pressed his suit with all
the energy and astuteness he afterward
displayed in business affairs. He en
countered increasing opposition from the
Daingerfield . family, and tne Judge de
nounced him as an upstart and threatened
to disown his sister lfshe should. marry
him. In spite of it all he won her, and
they had just settled down to housekeep
ing when he had to face; his first serious
reverse. The market went the wrong way
one day - and Mr. . Keene saw. everything
he had swept into chaos. Even their
household goods were sold out at auction.
Many a time ; since . has he lost a dozen
times what he. lost then and only smiled,
but at that : time it was his all, and left
him to 'start the world over again.
While' he refused off ers of .employ
ment the young couple got along some
way until he could begin his curbstone
operations again in a small. way. as he
was firm in his belief that here lay his
fortune. . He finally, made a friend of
Senator Felton," who was a . powerful
factor In finance, and when he retired
from the San Francisco Mining Ex
change sold . his seat- to young
Keene, and \u25a0 trusted him for o the
moneys The arrangement made was
that he should pay, whatever price seats
were aelling for on - the exchange at
the time of the "calling in" of the loan,
which was left to the Senator. As soon
as he became a recognized broker
Keene prospered amazingly, and when
the loan was called be paid . back five
times the original - sum -he had ' bor

The larger success of Leslie M. Shaw
has all been made ' since Ihe . married.
He- paid V his -way through-^ college by

as a "hired man." At 28 he had worked
his way ;through:a law college in the

at Deniaon, lowa. "A* year, later, with a

PEARSOXS PRAISES WIFE.
"I started in life aa poor as the devil."
Dr. D. K. Pearsons occasionally remarks.
He worked his way through an academy
from ' a " farm, sawed wood in ' the "winter
and plowed corn in the summer.
He graduated at "Woodstock Acedemy
in Vermont and taught school five years,
during which time he was married, and
then took his degree at Dartmouth Col
lege, afterward practicing medicine. "But
my wife got that out of me." he said.
"She thought I could do something bet
ter, and she told me to go to work." It
was after this that Mr. Pearsons began
to make his money in land-selling ven
tures.
Referring to the happiness of couples
\u25a0wiTo have married on small Incomes, De
pew once said, "I said to a rich man one
day, 'What were your best days?' Ha
said, 'When I was station agent and was
getting $40 per month and I sold tickets
and my wife sold pies over the counter.*
I knew a. man who married when he had
$1200 a year and was perfectly happy.
When be got $50,GG0 a year he spent the
whole of it and was not nearly so happy.
He was in a business which kept growing
steadily, and he kept enlarging his style
of living as he went upward."
The often quoted saying of Mxs. Russell
Sage to the effect of her far greater hap
piness when she was, helping Mr. Sage
during the earlier years of their married
Ufa, when they had little money. Is one
of the cases which support this theory,
which Mr. Depew elaborates still farther.
â¢ ; "Search the lives of the men who have
made history, of the men who have
achieved true greatness, who have won
fame, who have acquired wealth. ThÂ»
vast majority,: of them^were married, and
of these. the greater part married young.
Annexing a wife and family In youth Is
merely a higher and wiser form of put
ting money In the bank. No other Invest
ment yields so much In later years. That
marriage halves one's principles and
doubles one's troubles is an idiotic saw.
probably Invented by a bachelor. There
is too much talk of this sort. Men speak
of matrimony, as if it were a millstone
tied about their neck. The lives ;of tha
world's most successful men give the He
to this fallacy. Let a man marry Just as
soon as he can support a wife, although
not before he can support one. the In
come that is necessary being a matter to
be decided between the two people."

That sentence, taken- from the 327 th
fciage of Anthony Hope Hawkins' new j
fcovel, "A Servant of the Public," Is per
haps the one most characteristic of the
fetory which could be culled from it. This
htw work of the famous author of "'The
Prisoner of Z<nda" is a study of life in
its stcond-best eventualities. Things
might have been, better; they certainly
could have betn worse. This is true of
the lives of all of us; but it is especially
true ol the lives which are unfolded for
our contrmpiation in this book. X
The sentence mention* d was uttered by \
Ashley iiead, who was the person prin
cipally interested in and affected by the
life and character of tht "Servant of thÂ«-
Publlc." Lady Muddock had been talk
ing to Ashley, trying to convert him to
the erred of the best in distinction to the
6tcond best.
Â» But Ashley wuuld n<x b* persuaded. The

From that extract you will know at
once that it is not as pleasant story. It
leaves you with more than half a heart
ache; but with the consolation that your
heart had ached the more had not the
p<ople been at least half sensible and
half virtuous, so' as, to save their lives
from being wholly wrecked. While not a
delightful story, it is one well worth read
ing. It is strong, thoughtful, witty, and,
it is unnecessary to mention, well writ
ten, since Anthony Jiopc wrote it. The
conversation* are a brilliant feature of
the work, which might have been ex
pected, blnce the author of "The Doiiy
Dialogues" is probably the present prince
of conversation writers. It is said that
practical politics is compromise. The
mood In which Anthony Hope was when
he composed this study of the lives of
half a dozen fairly virtuous people must
have moved him to write down with all
the consummate cleverness his ta:cnts
made possible that human life is but a
compromise.
Ashley Mead, who accepts this fate of
second best for himself as the most man
ly way of looking the facts squarely in
the face unflinchingly, is the character
perhaps of co-equal Interest. in the story
i^Sth the "servant of the public"; or at
A'^st it is in her relations with him that
' iier nature is Ik st illustrated. She Is an
actress named Miss Ora Pinsent. Her en
trance into the circle of the lives of the
five people,, whose history Hope gives,
changes their fate toTSuch an extent that
eht might verily be called their fate. She
may have b<:Â«n intended by the author as
typifying the temperament of^a certain
class of women who are - naturally ac
tresses; but whether so or not, this par
ticular one only justified her existence by
being a good servant of the public in
her profession as actress. In private
life the tendency of her influence was
to make things happen second best for
all concerned with her. It was,prob
ably just as much their fault as hers,
however. Certainly this was bo In' the
case of Ashley, who deliberately let
hlxnstlf drift into close association with
her, and risked whatever pain there
might be mingled with the pleasure of
loving her. as a xnan,x>f the world who
, dares the price.
To describe this woman briefly would be
very difficult, for most of the book is her
description. A glimpse can be got by
what hrr friend. Lady Kilnorton. said
and thought of her. This friend had a
double motive for trying to form a cor- i
rect Judgment, for, as was said. It was
notorious to all London that she was \
'â¢desperately" In love" with, the actress;
end, further, she was growing quite jeal
ous because the man she loved. Lord i
Bowdon, was fascinated with Ora, Â» "I ;
tdmlre and despise, love and most bitter- ":
ly hate. Ora Pinsent," said Lady Kllnor- ;
ton. Later she went and looked at the
portrait of her friend as it stood on the
mantelpiece.
â¢' showed a woman in a .mood of audacity,
â¢t>v merry and triumphant.' but : distantly, ap
pr^honsive of some new and untried danger.!
ICxuJta.tion, barely yet- most eurely touched
with fear, filled tie Â«yes and shaped the
fmile. It seemed to Jrene Kilnorton that, if
Ora knew Jhereeli' and her own temper, such
reasonably might be "her disposition toward the
world and her own life, as well sf her pqse in
the play to which she now drew all the town;
Tor her power of enjoying greatly in all like
lihood carried with It its old companion, the
power to greatly surfer. Yet to Irene a sort
of triviality affected both capacities.
Irtne is a widow of 29. Ora is 27, and
is living apart from her husband, who is a
worthless fellow. Lord Bowdon was- a
bachelor of 4L an old friend and compan
ion of Irene. He had drifted into a strong
affection for' her and had about made up
bis mind to propose to her. She guessed
this truth and intended to accent him.
When he meets Ora he loves her. Irene
guesses this alÂ«o correctly. Wonderful
are the intuitions of Irene. Later she,
from intuition's promptings, guesses
rightly another important thingâ the very
core <-of the story's plotâ namely, that
Lord Bowdon had 'lent Ashley a thou
sand pounds, with which that youth 'had
cleverly bought off Ora' s drink-demoral
ized.l - .Qshand and made him pledge.hims
elf not to come to her not to . bother
her. Bowdon Dlays with the 'emotion of
loving the actress for a sfiort time, but
decides to be sensible," and To. lnsure him
\ self against any further ' folly hastens
: his suit for the hand of Irene and rushes
into "marriage as a precautionary mea*
ure." â¢
A desciiotlon of Bowdon's visit to the
actress is one of the book's many good
things. i
Fhe was lying back on the sofa. "And 1
think." she went on, "that the world is rath
| â¬r dull, and that you're rather;like the world
I this alternoon." ,
He did not dispute the point. A man who
wants to make- love. but. is withheld by the
sense that he ought not Is at his dullest. Bow
don's state was this and ~ even worse. Ora
w,as a friend of Irene KUnorton'e; hew much
had she guessed, observed or been told?
"Have you a conscience?" he asked her sud
denly.
"Oh, yes," she answered; â¢"afterward."
"That's a harmless variety." he said wist
fully. .* \u25a0 ' .
"Tiresome, though." she murmured. Lat?r
she said to him, "Irene Is so charming and
clever. She'd Just suit you."
"You're ebsolutely right," said Ilowdon.
- "TheA why don't .you?" Â£he looked nt him
for a moment and he met her gaze; a. slight
tint of color cam* en nor cheeks, and her lips
curved in amusement. "Ob, what nonsanee'.''
she cried a moment later and drew back from
him and stood there smiling al him. The next ,
moment she went on: "It is quite nonsense,
you know." Â£
Now when we remember -that Irene
knew -with her wonderful .intuitions and
her inquisitive inquirings that this inter
view, or else one quite eaulvalent to it.
actually happened, and, -notwithstanding
that, she soon afterward married Lord
Bovrdori, we can realize how;tragi-comi
caliy that couple accepted the' formula of
the second best. That settles them, and
\u25a0we will proeecd to consider the"* cases ot
the: other characters. Their settling;
down, however, need not have been :so
awfully second best if they had sweetly
held their tongues about Ora; but Irene
must needs make her husband confess
about the thousand pound buying-off af
fair. Bowdon owned up fully, but by fate's
caprice ' when he mentioned Ashley's re-_
payment of the loan his manner betrayed
Irritation. . Instantly ; Irene.* of the won
derful Intuitions, guessed -that her lord's
irritation proved that he still -loved Ora.
He wanted' to ! hug to himseff the credit
of having < paid the thousand pounds and
so saved -her i, fro ro tne return of ; her
drink-spoiled husband. Irene was '-- rather
pale but. she "smiled a little. "I j knew
all the time that you ; were in love with
her- too." she said. : ."Of 'course -you
wouldn't let the man "go near; her!"; Bow-*
don raised his eyes â¢ to - his * wife's * face.
She turned away again. "I knew, it when
I made you \u25a0 propose : to â¢ me," she : said. \u0084

Ashley looked him . full In the face for a

'Although the author is a partisan of
the Christian religion he endeavors to
give i his work a. ;â¢ scope beyond sectar
ian, and- to furnish subject of thought
for. all who have â¢ any religious belief
whatever. . Far from being a contemner
â¢or belittler of the religions of > the
East, he treats them with the greatest
respect; and instead of asking the In;
dians to throw away their religion; ln
order-: to ,accepj ? ours in Its place he
uses the \u25a0 figure of. two great rivers
flowing into one of broader, deeper,
grander flow, to'; Illustrate the coming
union of Christian and; Oriental'
thought.:. He even goes so far as to
evince the^belief r that' when a large
body~of Hindu scholars accept the doc
trines of Christ as the" supreme relig
ious'* truth these intensely contempla
tive devotees of religion will ; give to
Christianity a far -finer interpretation
and a purer, completer realization of . it
into life's actual .living than ever we
Westerns have reached up to.
It , might be playfully suggested j that
this is one of the \ moat potent argu
mejits that, could possibly ,be made to
the skeptical -Eastern; scholar with his
eyes | wide-openly aware to conditions
In/the wicked West. If Dr. Hall could
convince those Oriental tpundits that
Christian principles w^tuld show up ail
right if Westerns were not ; such im
potent and futile practicers^ thereof,
and that the , same principles put - to
proof by -devoted Oriental disciples
would "surely and swiftly make the
world Ideal, -then. Indeed, they might
seriously consider speedy , adoption of
our doctrinesâ but failing*, success of
that consummately clever appeal it is
to be feared that, despising our ex
ample, they will .continue reluctant to
embrace our belief. _', *
"There is a' tone to the book that
awakes attention to world-wide ques
tions, aside from the great religious
considerations. There has been quite a I
progress in events and rapid change in
international conditions, which have
broug-ht Oriental affairs and ideas into
prominence. The lecturer says: j \u25a0
. \u25a0â¢-' An opinion steadily gains /ground that the
East is the horns of ideas and forces that - are
to \u25a0 have j a .- significant \u25a0\u25a0 bearing ; on â¢ the ? future

John Philip Sousa
Writes' a Good Tale
The- "march king," John Philip Sousa,
has shown his versatility by writhig a
very good story called "Pipetown Sandy,"
a narration of boy life which will delight
both boys and grown folks. This is notÂ»
his first excursion into literary effort, as
witness the novel named "The Fifth
String." The great orchestra leader tells
a rattling good tale of - the lively kids
and he has their dialect dowÂ« very pat.
There is a little about music interwoven
in the work, but he has not-tried to make
that "a feature: ' \u25a0'. : '- <Â£\u25a0'Â£\u25a0?
The storyÂ»- opens with a scene In a
f choolroom \u25a0 that is well done, and there
we get acquainted with some of the boys
who get on the nerves of the teacher,
Miss Maisie, and make things lively gen
erally. Sandy is very dull at school and
he Is kindly assisted In his studies^ by
the delicate . little Gilbert. . who has a
bright brain and a good heart. Tom
Foley 13 the bad boy of the school. He
lr? detestably mean to his teacher and
also to' his mother, who Is a widow, quite/
poor and who needs the help of her son
very much. She does not know she is
a widow, .but her. husband has forsaken
her and she has not heard from him in
years. Gilbert tries to comfort the stupid
Sandy, by s such, expedients, as .this: . -â.â..
"My father says. there have been some
awfully smart people high up In the world
who were hot worth shucks In doing
sums In, arithmetic." . .-..-.
Tom Foley behaves so badly that Maisie
has to = â¢ expel him. - Mrs. 1 Foley. who,
though a young and charming woman
and' handsome, has had no advantages
of birth or education, drags the expelled
boy back to the schoolroom, beating him
all the way. and pours out her distress
and dlsheartenment about her incorrigible
boy to the teacher: â¢ . '
"Maisie Latham; this Is the third time
this brat has been sent home this month.
Do I pay you to suspend him. or to
educate him? -Answer me that? You get
50 cents a month in advance for
him. and I'm not a-payin' for nuthin*."
Then Mrs. Foley took fram her pocket
a small pamphlet and' read slowly and
emphatically:
The object of Miss Maisie Latham's School
for Boys is. first, to arouse the mentality of the
pupil and to awaken his power to think; sec
ond to foster a sturdy moral nature and to
develop the scholar's Individuality; third, to
perfect the : student in . those general studies
that lead to a preparatory course. t
Mrs. Foley. mad with her son. and the
exasperation of -things generally, claimed
that in that promise there was V'nothin*
'bout : suspensions, and beln" incorrigible,
as I can decipher. '\ Malsie, in 'pity 'for
the' mother, took the bad boy back.
The prettiest episode in the book is the
wooing of the widow Foley by the grocer.
Mr. 'Jebb. :It. cameabout through
sympathy for her on account of her son
'Corn's and disobedience to her.
Pipetown Sandy was the- medium : that
made the wooing t progress ;\u25a0 pleasantly,
humorously and successfully. Tom would
come home hungry and his mother would v
promise him dinner provided ,he brin?
water and fill up the barrels for her; for
she was a woman who tolled. The young
rascal would protest that he couldn't
work till :he was fed, ; and she would In
dulgently share her fare with him. "Glm
rne my'gtub fust, I ain't goin* to promise
nuthln' while I'm starvinV*. After he had
devoured everything on the table he
walked to ; the door one- day. : and called
to â¢ his mother: "Eh. old woman. ,. carry
your own .water; â¢ over the river, ta-ta!"
and away he went.v Mrs. Foley, standing
in>the doorway,- heard his parting shot,
and stood in a stare as he
scampered away. .
' It is.! this pathetic incident that the
artist, Charles Louis. Hinton, has chosen
to . picture. . The young^ widow looking
despairingly after her Incorrigible boy,
who "was the son of a man who had been
a bad husband. "Sadly, and with Just
trie susplcldn of a tear, she picked up, the
water buckets and started for the pump."-,
Mr. "Jebb saw her, plight, loved; her. and
hired : Pipetown Sandy to tote water for.
her. He Instructed the boy to artfully
pretend \ that" he .was doing It ,out of his
own boyish \ sympathy - and kindness; but
"Mrs. Foley discovered ;the little plot; and
then bliss. -\u0084.-.. \

: ed of your literary auld lan* syne.
i In his essay. "Adventures Among
i Books." he tells us of the literary things
he loved from the boyhood days of Ms
I earliest recollection. He says there la a
nursery legend concerning him which re
lates that he was wont to arrange six
open "books on six chairs and go from
I one to the others perusing them by
I turns. "No doubt this was desultory
[reading, but I did not hear the criticism
, till later." Certainly that must be the
I most remarkable example of the much
I deprecated "desultory reading" that can
t be found In all literature; and the asser
i tion that such Is a ruinously evil dissi
pation may be deemed to have Its tri
umphant confutation in the brilliantly
successful literary career of the adult
j Andrew Lang, who evoluted from that
adolescent browser on bookish tidbits..
He says that "people forbid children to
read this or that. I am sure they need
not. * â¢ In Shakespeare's magic mirror
children see only what Is pure." In his
essay on Dr. John Brown, which he fe
licitously entitles "Rab's Friend." he #
says, "of *Rab and his Friends' It is su
perfluous to tell, for every one who reads
at all has read that story, and most read
ers not without tears."
.In his composition on 'The Confessions
of Saint Augustine," he. like as some old
' friend would, tells us of his individual
copy of the famous work,, "a dark Tittle
book." and quotes "a size uncumbersome
to thÂ« nicest hand." and says that it
was bound in black morocco, and adorned
with skulls and cross-bones. He selects
from this little skull-decorated book
what was probably the frankest of all
the confessions of the greatly frank
Saint Augustine. It was of the time
when the spiritual and the carnal wills
I were fighting within the saint for mas-
I tery: "Give me chastity and continency,
0 Lord." he would pray, "but do not
give it yet."
Talking of Nathaniel Hawthorne he re
lates this of his methods of labor: "All
his work was leisurely. All his language
waa picked, though not with affectation.
He did not strive to make a style out of
the use of odd words, or of familiar words
in odd places." Almost always he looked
for "a kind of spiritual medium, seen
through which his romances, like the old
Manse in which he dwelt, had not quite
the aspect of belonging to the material
world." '
\ About Mr.. Morris* poems Andrew Lang
writes as one who had been by them en
chanted. I will give you here as well
worth rereading a fragment of one of
those Fairtly wrought poems which held
the power of enchantment for that keen
but kindly critic. Andrew Lang. It is
from a song of the. Nereid to Hylas. and
VMr. Morris is always happy with his
Nymphs and Nereids":
1 knew a little garden close
Set thick with my and with rosÂ«.
Where I would wander if I might
From dewy morn to dewy night
And have one with me wandering.
And though within it no birds slug.
And though no pillared house is there.
And though the apple .boutrhs are bar*
Of fruit and blossom, would to- God.,
Her feet upon the green grass trod
And 1 beheld them as before.
Yet. tottering as I am and weak.
Still have I felt a Uttle breath
To seek within the jaws or death
An entrance to that happy place.
To seek the unforgotten face
Once seen, once kissed, once rett from tnÂ»
Anlgh the murmuring of the sea.

Dainty Verse Comes
Untler Dainty Covers
A tiny* brochure of verses â jttit a
baby of a book â comes to us from thÂ«
California Hotel. It 'Is called "What
They Have Done, and Other Verses,"
and Is written by C. F. Davis <"NÂ«al").
In the center of It are these four
stanzas, which may bring memories of
some similar incidents to many who
have loved and lost:
THAT BABT HAND.
My thoughts are. with the past to-night J
In a night long years gone by
I stooped to feel a baby hand.
And Heard a baby cry:
'"Oh! Mama,' dear, it's g'owte* dark,
I feels afald. mama;
If oo will let me take oo hand.
ril know Just whera oo are." U
I pressed that little fevered palm:
And then, with restless will.
It wandered o'er my fice and head: .
And then. O God, was still!
"" -And ever since, though striving hard'
God's will to understand.
I crave no greater Joy above
Than clasp that baby hand!

revolver to the trembling cocher*S tem

"Your money or your life!" The night
was dark and the street deserted.
Dazed with fear. Schreider began to
count out his money.
Just then a revolver shot rang out,
and a third man appeared on the scene,
threw himself on the highwayman who
was holding the horse's bridle, while,
seeing this turn of affairs, the cabman
seized hold of the man beside him. The
two bandits were eventually overcome,
bound and placed in the cab, and, thus
hauled off to Auteuil.' There It trans
pired that the rescuer was a well
known artist, who had seen the attack
from his window on the Boulevard de
Murat, and rushed. down to the rescue.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 9.â While Presi
dent Roosevelt gets great praise for
the adjustment of peace between Rus
sia and Japan, the State Department is
not likely, to emerge with much credit
trom the negotiations, although As
sistant Secretary of State Pelrce was
on duty at Portsmouth throughout as
the representative of the President.:: '".j
The publication of the correspond- ',
tnce from the Japanese and Russian i
envoys showing that each had con- j
tributed fIO.QOO to the State of New'
Hampshire in appreciation of the en
tertainment that had been accorded
them is taken by diplomats here as a
direct slap in the faces of Mr. Pelrce,
Governor McLane of New Hampshire
and the gentlemen in control of the
Frank Jones estate, who manage the
Wentworth Hotel at Newcastle.
Until there is a Congressional In
vestigation nothing will be known as
to who was responsible for the selec
tion of Portsmouth as the meeting
place of the envoys or of the Went
worth Hotel as their lodging place.
The State Department approved the se-
of the navy yard and the hotel
and also a cottage on the Jones estate
as a temporary residence for Assist
ant Secretary of State Peirce. It is as
sumed that all the arrangements were
made by Mr. Peirce and approved by
the President.
It is certain that the envoys went to
Portsmouth expecting to pay for their
own board. However, officials of the
State of New Hampshire declared that
while no appropriation had been made
for ihiÃ purpose and no funds were
available, "private citizens** would ad
vance the money and that "possibly"
the State would reimburse them.
During the progress of the conference
It became more than a suspicion that
the envoys were being used as a great
advertising scheme to fill the Went
worth Hotel with Bummer guests. It
succeeded admirably. If that was the
scheme. Mr. Pelrce was very comfort
able in his cottage and Governor Mc-
Lane spent most of the time at the ho
tel with his family.
When the conference was over both
the Russian and Japanese envoys asked
for their bills. The Japanese addressed
to the Governor a letter in which they ,
asked for the liberty of enclosing ' a
check for $10,000 as a slight token of
their appreciation for the many marks
of courtesy shown them. They asked
him to be gooA enough to utilize this
check for such purposes In the State of
New Hampshire as his Excellency
might deem fit.
The Japanese envoys sent the check
they absolutely refused to ac
cept f reÂ« board from the State of New
Hampshire or the United States and
there is not a doubt that the total
amount of the check they tendered to
the Governor of New Hampshire to be
applied to "6uch purpose as he may ,
deem fit" will much more than reim
burse the "private citizens" who are
alleged, to have advanced the price of
the envoys' hotel bills.
The letter of the Japanese envoys to
Governor McLane is dated Monday; Sep
tember 4, the day before the treaty was
signed.
The Russian envoys sent a similar .
check to the Governor of New Hamp
shire oh September 7, after they had
arrived in Neiv York, and in their let
ter to the Governor asked him to have
It distributed as he might see fit among
Jhe charitable institutions of the State.
The Japanese letter indicates that
both parties of envoys feel that they
were not willing to rest under the im
putation of having received free board.

Surgical Miracles
Worked by Chi
cagoans.
Vital Organs of Animals
Moved to Various
Parts of Body.
University Men Succeed in
Reversing the Circulation
of the Blood.
Epeclal Disr&tcb to The Call.
CHICAGO, Sept. $.â Experiments upon
the vital organs have been conducted at
the University of Chicago by Drs. Car
rell and Guthrie *f hich. it Is thought, may
lead to knowledge permitting the graft
ing of the heart of one being to another.
The doctors have successfully moved the
hearts of dogs up into their necks, where
they have - continued to perform " their
functions perfectly. They also have been
able to reverse the circulation of the
blood in animals experimented upon with
out killing the animal.
Dr. Carrel 1 will begin new experiments
early In October. He declared that many
startling things have been learned about
the heart. - , . - â¢ -,' \u25a0 - 'v-> W -*â¢â¢:; \u25a0â¢*
"We have hope," he said, to-day, "from
what we have learned, that some day we
will be able to replace a wounded or worn
out heart in a human being with a
healthy, youthful and strong one from a
living monkey."
Among other experiments performed in
his laboratory. Dr. Carrell has switched
the circulation of dogs from some of the
arteries, thus leaving them dry for a
time. -This opens vast possibilities for
new methods of surgery in extreme cases.
One of the animals selected for the ex
periments was completely bald in places.
His circulation was switched and Dr.
Carrell declares hair began to grow upon
spots that were apparently permanently
bald.
Another^ experiment which was per
formed by Dr. Carrell, who was formerly
a surgeon in the French army and" in
structor in the University of Lyons,
showed that gangrene and other poison
ous diseases of the blood could be cured.
He altered the location of a dog's kid
neys, moving them to a point In the ani
mal's neck in such a manner that the ani
mal is still living. The doctor asserts
that by this means he can reverse \u25a0 the
flow of blood and that, consequently, in
the case of gangrene, poisonous matter in
the blood would be forced out.
In another operation, Carrell sawed off
one of a dog's legs, and, after experi
menting with It, successfully replaced it,
the dumb martyr to science being able
to walk about without limping.

VICTORIA. B. C. Sept. 9.-That not
withstanding the present friendliness be-%

envious eyes cast by* Uncle Sam, upon her
territory Is the opinion of Hon. Sir Fred

Defense, who has Just arrived In British-
Columbia on. a 'general trip of Inspection."
In an interview to-day he said:
' "We are - arranging ror> a- chain of
fortresses from Halifax .to Vancouver,
and while, of- course, this will be Im
mediately utilized as places where officers
of the militia can receive training and for
the maintenance of order. within our. own
borders, we must look to the future and
be prepared to show the necessary de
fensive strength to our aggressive neigh

The .Government has noticed with soma
degree of uneasiness the remarkable in
flux 'of Americans into Manitoba and taa
Northwest Territories. These now num
ber several hundred thousands and many
of them do not evince : a disposition to
become Canadian citizens. - Than again,
we are cognizant of tha fact that tha
United \u25a0 States is â¢. fast .becoming a great
military and naval power. In tha present
state of Its defenses tbÂ» United States
could take Canada in a week. We must
not allow even such Â«. remote possibility
to remain unprepared for and tha policy
of a the Government Is to materially
strengthen its defensive works. Tha total
estimate for tha present yÂ«ar for military
purposes is 35,500,000.
: In British Columbia we will examine thÂ»
fortress and works at Esquimau, which
we are shortly . to take over from Great

EHIItLIN. Sopt. 9.-The studios of the

more "or less well-executed portraits to be
Mowed from the regulation distance, or

style.
It is therefore something of a surprise
that awaits the visitor to the ateliers of
Fraukin Grete Waldau, .the foremost
woman painter in Germany, who has won
this high position in the most difficult of all
the branches of artâ that which is known
as architectural painting. Her ateliers,
xvhich occupy the top floor of a house in
one of Berlin's most exclusive streets, are
furnished 'in massive style, there being
little or nothing in the way of decoration
iK'sidc tbe artist's own works. High up on
the vrjills hanjz the sketches for some ol
her colossal paintinir?, Â»nd the pictures,
which are many in number, representing
mainly city bui'dinss or etre*ts, church
Iricnorn or sketches of architectural de
tails, give insight into the tireless dili
pence of the artist, which testimonials
and a warmly expressed personal tele
gram from the German Emperor show
tljit her work has won for her both royal
and official recognition.* . v>* : -

A CLEAN MAN.
Outside cleanliness is less than half I

it. He \rill work with *'* * '
energy and think clean, clear, healthy
thoughts.
He will never be troubled with liver,-

found where there is unclean blood, i

!,the floor, shouting that he would waste f
no more time on such a stupid scholar,
that she would never be able to draw
and that she had better go home.
i The little girl obeyed meekly, but
her purpose, confessed only to herself,
never wavered, and* when, some time
later in response to her earnest, re- \u25a0
quest, her mother, ever her. closest and j
best friend, permitted her to buy a box;
of paints, the eager young artist seated
hcrst-lf before the Roman portal in the!
! ancient llagdalcna Church in the spring j
1 sunshine and painted her first picture,
I which was received with* such favor- j
â¢ able criticism when it was exhibited by 1
j the leading art dealer in Breslau that !
i her destiny was at once determined." 1
She entered the Academy of Art in â¢
I her native city and later went to !
Kuremburg, where she placed herself j
under the celebrated architectural â¢
painter, Ritler, but her own joyous and )
exuberant love of the glory and bril- j
llant colors that her young eyes saw ;
in nature around her could not agree \
with the "gray theories" of the old \
technicist and she left him to follow'
nature for her teacher. The next few j
years were devoted to traveling and in- j
dependent study in Russia. Holland, j
France and England, the faithful Bres
lauer returning ever to her native city
for motifs, proving with each new work
her broadened views and ripening
talent.
ATTRACTS KAISER'S ATTENTION.
Her first important work was . the j
Lorenz Church in- Nuremburg,. which!
is In tbe possession of the King of j
Roumania. Then followed a number. of t
church interiors, the mural decorationsj
in the palace .of a Polish magnate and^
In the: postoflice - in : Oldenburg, . for
which latter the : young artist was \u25a0
I awarded >'her first .honor.- the -..Grand I
j Duke of Oldenburg's gold medal for
art -and science.
After exhibiting in Vienna, London,
Munich and -Berlin ; the < artist, whose
works, owing to her untiring energy
and zeal, .followed eacn -other ' In . in- I
credibly quick succession, came to the J
capital and established her studio, ex- 1
hibiting at the same time the picture]
that won for her me position of the j
nrst woman artist in Germany. It was j
the high altar of the ancient Cisterciiri
Abbey in' Grussau, Silesia. The critics
were unanimous in their praises of ; it,
recognizing another Menzel \u25a0 , in ; the
work of the younger artist; no medi
ocre talent could have overcome the
technical difficulties of reflex light fall-
Ing on the rich creamy marble pil
lars, the fine carving on the choir 1
stalls and. the plastic figures of angels.]
In addition to this the work showed j
strong individuality and a youthful j
enthusiasm, free and untrammeled by
j schools or traditions. This work turned i
* the attention of the German Emperor, ]
â¢ever alert to find such, of his subjects J
J as. share his enthusiastic interest in the]
I preservation, of signs; of Hhe alte" zeit"
in the fatherland, to- the young artist,
and it was at his instigation that she
was given the state, commission, for
two colossal pictures for the Deutsches
Hans at the Paris Exposition of 1900.
Thus she was. the first woman In Ger
many to receive commissions; for.
works of art from' the Government ',:
.KARXS ROYAL PAV On./
She . chose a' view of "golden". ' Mainz, |
j the cradle of printing, and one of Leipzig,!
I the chief commercial center of the trade..]
The paintings were executed in the short j
space 'of- two" months- and 'won for the'
artist the award of a gold medal. Since;
then the Emperor and , ,' Empress have
\ taken jjreat Interest hi Grete; Waldau and
- her work. ' Not infrequently; she; ls* sum- i
i moned to the imperial pal Me, where the ;
â¢ Emperor points out to .: her : some view â¢
\ which he likes or discusses anotherj
' ; which would : present technical or \u25a0 other :

followed the second state commission for
the German Industrial Hall at the St.
J.oui.Â« Exposition,- and the result was four
of the most remarkable paintings in this
; line that have ever been executed, by; a
: woman. Two of these ( showed the mam
; moth Krupp works |at j Essen, the other
two the Konigshutte iron foundries* in
1 Silesia. A less conscientious and thor

. ";The great- electrical parade to-night
was. a magnificent rinisn to ; s thV splen
did ceremonials and f estiyities'in honor
of the. nfty-iifth anniversary, of tbe ad
mission of CalifonÂ»*ii' to the Union.
Nearly; a score of goats were in line,"
all electrically; fllujppiated, with avbril-.
liaiicy . not ' bef ore^qualed. - There was
no float jn the line: that was not artistic
in design artd 'finish, and in the great
majority of "cases" the outlines of the
structures; were' all J laid down,j,in ; in
candescent lights.. One of. the floats, in
three sections, employed 2000 lamps.
In that, as in- nil the other cases,, the
electrical " current ' /was ' fed / from the
overhead trolley and therefore the pro
cesnion followed the course of: the elec
tricrailway. "The most brilliant and
novel of the floats was that of the Sac
ramento -Gas and ;Electrlc Railway
Company.' It* was a reproduction inac
tion of its work from* the Genesis of
P9wÂ«r tothlÂ»eity,-a distance' of- twen
ty-two miles. . . .
, Henry 'J. Angelo. district deputy grand
president of. the. Native Sons, was. as
usual, one 'of the" active participants in
the celebration. .Angelo, has been a mem
ber of the order sinco ISSS, when he be

monstrated. In" striking manner here to
day, to the great delight of the thousands
of Native Sons, assembled in honor of

that -serious" delay in trig regular 'train
service would wait on . the efforts of the
Southern Pacific to salely move the
throngs to the festival city The Call made
extra arrangements to see that there
would not only be no delay in distribut
ing the paper-in Sacramento but'that the
people here would be served \u25a0 even; earlier
than : usual. * The arrangements were
executed j without a hitch. - .. ! -
' This morning at* 6:40 a large edition of

special train .en route to Sacramento.

for the special and at every station along
the route bundles 'were thrown off to the
waiting crowds, "oacramento was. reached
exactly at 1u:45 o'clock and there was not
a moment's delay -in the final work of
distribution. S.: C. Spero, â¢ Sacramento
agent of The Call, met the special at the
depot' with wagons.. V -.'.\u25a0â ..'\u25a0-";'
The moment the : train^came -to a

Of "disrtibution, . - where hundreds of
youngsters. -were .in-waiting. .-All were
supplied with- Calls, and Vwithin half an
hour 'the entire editionr<w*s. "distributed:
"'As 'the paper contained -a^ulli and : *ac-l
curate account of the festive events that
were to "occur,? together' with aIL of the
news" r of the'day,' ,-it was eagerly-sought;
with the result that when ; the other gan

after The Call- was on, the- streets, .they
found every one 'supplied.' 'Many of ".the
Native Sons called at -The Call head

BETTER THAT ADVERTISING
. How. often we hear arid read the ex-
pression. "A. triend [ advised me [ to try
Peruna. < I' tried it and found it to be
exactly what I wae: looking for."
At least ten times as many people
.have taken Peruna because a friend ad-
. vised: them tv do 50 as have taken .it
because they saw. it "advertised.
Advertisements,, however attractive
they may be made,: cause only a small
per cent of .the sales of Peruna.
â¢ It Is the advice which friend gives to
friend which sells Peruna. \u25a0
' sPfruna ' cures one,, person of some

this: cure a doren other people are in-
duced to take Peruna. [_

"I considnr Peruna one of the greatest
remedies known to mankind. .-
"Being- an active man all my life, and
with the constant strain and ambition
to try "and make life a success, I
found out to my sorrow, some five years
ago, that ray physical strength was
leaving fast, although not then had I
reached the meridian' of life.
"I began at to try to study my-
self and apply such remedies as I
thought would reach my case.
"I tried every remedy I could think
of. but only temporary relief would re-
sult, and I finally came to the conclu-
sion that proprietary or patent medl-
cinea were a 'fake.'
"Coming: to your city about a year
ago, I looked upon the trip to Columbus
tes being my last. -'

most prominent citizens I was Induced
to give Peruna a fair trial. â¢ Â» \u25a0 '

C-M.DUER, Prop.. IVtiKht* CÂ»i.PRISONS OF THE MIKADO'S
CAPITAL ARE CROWDED.
Rioting in Tokio Is Chedked, but Active Rolitieal
Agitation by Educated Classes Continues. â> v
COMPLETE LIST OF THE KILLED;IS BEING PREPAREI):
TOKIO, Sept. 2. 8:30 p. m. â Public
excitement and apprehension are subr
elding. While an active political agita
tion continues, the prospect .of addi
tional violence is decreasing.
It is Impossible to obtain accurate
figures of the killed and injured during
the rioting. Many of the wounded were
conveyed to their homes, concealing
their condition.
The Barristers' Association is gath
ering tiati&tics of the killed and
wounded and it is probable that it will
produce an accurate list later. The
cumber of arrests is withheld, but it
Is estimated that it will amount to
xs&ny hundreds.
General sSakuma's instructions to the
troops preserving order in the capital
have produced a favorable Impression.
Â£:r.ce the proclamation of martial law
there has been no act of violence ne
cessitating the use of armc The street
cars resumed their usual service this
evening.
Among the educated there is every
Indication, however, of a strong under
current of dissatifaction, verging on in
dignation, aganist the peace terms.
The council of the Propressive party
held a meeting to-day and passed a reso
lution strongly condemning the Govern
ment for having concluded a peace that
is tensed humiliating and one that re
sulted in an uprising In Tokio, necessi
tating martial law.
Count Okuma was absent from the
meeting, owing to illness.
T&e resolution was as follows:
"The peace concluded by our pleni
potentiaries is opposed to the purpose of
the war, forfeits the fruits of victory and
Is diametrically against the national
Interest. It is a lasting humiliation
and the Government must be held re
sponsible therefor.
"The inefficiency of the police, result-
Ing in the proclamation of martial law
end the annulling of the freedom of
epeech guaranteed by the constitution.
Is the greatest "offense since the estab
lishment of constitutional government.
ThÂ« Cabinet is responsible for this
grave offense."
The Government has ordered the sus
pension of the Asahi, a Tokio news
paper. It also has ordered the suspen
sion of the Nippon, a Conservative pa
per, and the Jinmln, a Radical paper,
on account of objectionable articles
dealing with the local situation.
Another attack was made upon the
residence of Home Minister Toshlkawa
<>arly Wednesdaj' morning. The mem
bers of the mob closed in on the build
ing, into which they threw firebrands
and succeeded in starting a small blaze.
â¢ This the military guards extinguished
and beat off the attacking party. It is
reported that explosives were thrown
et the building: during the attack, but
this Is not confirmed.
SThe g-uard captured twenty of the
tta^king party and imprisoned them
within the compound. Later the crowd
j-ent emissaries to the guards, who
bfgged for the release of the captives.
Their petition was refused and the
guards are still holding the prisoners.
FURTHER RIOTING UNLIKELY.
Kntsara Cabinet Will Retire When the
Diet Is Convened.
TOKIO. Sept. 9.â Yesterday irnd last
evening were almost without incident.
A few crowds collected at various
points A.nA made slight demonstrations
against the police stations, bat there
was neither fijrhtlng; nor disorder.
General Sakuma. who established
his heademrters at the War. Office and
directed the military operations and
the policing of the city from there, has
withdrawn tha guards from the for
ei?n Ideations, which are deemed to be
In no dnnger and without the necessity
of strong protection. However, sentries
!n small sctuads continue to watch the
legations, and the military patrols have
been extended in order to' completely
protect the city.
There have been no further demon
strations against churches or missions.
It was feared for a time that tho
crowds might menace the larger, for
eign missionary establishments at Tsu
kljl nr.d Aoyama. but the principal es
tablishments have not been disturbed.
The rusnenslon of streetcar traffic at
sundown has made the city more quiet
than usual, and In several districts
guards have patrolled 1 the deserted
streets.
The situation in other cities is being
keenly watched. Apparently the trou
ble is not spreading. There has "been
some disturbance at Chlba. Kobe and
Kyoto, though Â«t has not been serious.
Anti-peace meetingÃ which are being
held In many cities and towns are pass
ing resolutions denouncing the settlement
at Portsmouth, but are not Interfered
with unless they result In breathes of
the peace.
â¢ The destruction of the statue of Marquis
Ito at Kobe is generally resented and de
plored. It is pronounced to have been an
act irresponsible rowdies. It is report
ed to-night that the statue was recovered :
and conveyed to a warship lying in Kobe
harbor.
Better feeling followed the conferences
at Premier Katsura's house to-day, the
actual provisions of the treaty proving
elightly more satisfactory than had been
expected. This had a tendency to allay
resentment against the Government, and
the Premier's promise that there would
be a session of the Diet in October also
tends to Improve the situation.
ffhere is a growing belief that physical
violence will speedily end and that the
opponents of the Government will use
only ordinary political methods.
It is generally believed that the Kat
suia Cabinet will retire when the Diet
meets.
rn.YCE MEAXS DEVELOPMENT.
Field Jlarnfanl VamnjraJa Defends, the
Slalcado's Course..
TOKIO. Sept. ?. â The Nlchi-Nlchi pub
lishes an extended statement from Field
Marshal Yamagata reviewing the war. He
mst discuses the Russian advance into
Manrrhuria and Korea, and gives details
of .the'futile nesrotiations. He then re
fers to the increase of the Russian
r.av;il force arid Japan's resolution to
draw the sword for her own protection
txnd conQUer or die.
"After the victory of Mukden the prin
ciple of humanity," he says, "started
the rry for pence in Europe and Amer
ica. After the naval-victory in the sea
of J;ipan President Roosevelt advised
both belligerents to cease their of
f<Â«risfvt: operations. Difference of opin
ion and dissension over tho terras of
pence were unavoidable. !>ut the people
must remember that Russia's obduracy,
and desire to continue the war left no
hopx? of obtaining adequate repayment
to the Japanese without further sacri
fice of life and expenditure or money.
The cessation of hostilities was also ad-
Viintagcous to the national development
of Japan. A continuation Jof the war.
n;npnt a wastÂ«* orencrgy and resources."
Yamagata concludes by asserting that
Japan's military strength Is unimpaired
and that the armies could have taken

PEACE TERMS 'MADE' PUBLIC.
Premier \u25a0', Kntaura Explains * Treaty to
Japanese Lawmakers.,
TOKIO, Sept.^9.â At an informal meet
ing which took place yesterday ; between
the Premier, Count'Katsura,'and'mem
bers of both houses, representing the re
spective parties and associations, Count
Katsura made a full statement concern
ing the peace .negotiations.
It now transpires that the report that
Cape Soya, on La Perouse .Straits, could
not be fortified is unfounded, the -only
stipulation made with Russia being in
regard to the free passage of the straits.
Japan acquires a suzerainty over Korea
and will control entirely with a free hand
the affairs of the Peninsula Railroad
south of Changchun (not Changtu), the
former being ceded ' to Japan, with â¢ the
right to retain military guards for the
protection of the railroad. Japan also
holds the right to retain the collieries at j
Fushan and Tentai, even after the evacu
ation of the country by the Russians.
About ten months is the period allowed
to complete the removal of the Russian
troops from Manchuria.
The actual expense for keeping the
Russian prisoners of war is to be paid to
Japan.
Baron Tamamoto. Minister of the
Navy, who was present at the meeting,
said that although there was strong
popular dissatisfaction with the terms of
peace, it must be borne In mind that a
far heavier sacrifice of life would be
necessary to take Vladivostok than that
Involved in the capture of Port Arthur,
besides the heavy monetary outlay. It
was advisable, therefore, he said, to be
satisfied with the present terms. In con
clusion Baron Tamamoto said that Rus
sia was sure to build a strong navy, and
that Japan must ibe prepared to make
adequate provisions for such a con
tingency.
M. Olshi. leader of the Progressive
party, suggested that the Cabinet should
resign after concluding peace upon such
unsatisfactory terms.
When the fact that no stipulation ex
ists against the fortification of Cape Soya
and that Japan is to have a free hand in
the government of Korea becomes known,
It is expected that the popular indigna
tion will be considerably allayed.

FAIRBANKS CITY
IS LEADERLESS
Mayor Is Away and Mem
bers of Council Stampede
to the Kantishna Diggings
Special DUpatch to . Th* Call.
TACOMA, Sept. 9.â The stampede
from Fairbanks to the Kantishna dig
gings, 300 miles away,, has left that
city almost without â¢ city officials. A
majority of the Councilmen have gone
to Kantishna and Captain Barnett,
Mayor of .Fairbanks, is outside for the
winter. Dozens are leaving Fairbanks
daily for Kantishna, where a townsite
has been laid out.
Lte Van SHke, a former member of
the Washington State Legislature from
Tacoma, has been appointed Commis
sioner for the new district by Judge
Wickersham. Van Slike has been In
structed to make his headquarters at
that townsite, which will best serve
the largest number of miners after he
has examined the merits of all.
The owners of three Fairbanks sa
loons have gone to Kantishna to es
tablish mills. The steamers* te&ving
Fairbanks are carrying in 500 tons of
grub. It is takeh around by circuitous
route and must finally be portaged
for a long distance.
A dispatch announces that during a
etorrn several days ago the barge
Dwight was sunk near St. Michael,
losing 400 tons of freight from the
steamship Oregon. Its average value
was $100 a ton. The freight was des
tined for Tanana.

PITCHES TENT
IN A CEMETERY
Octogenarian Keeps Guard
Over Spot WTiere His
Wife's Kemains Are Buried
Special tHecatch to The Call.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Sept 9.â Because
he fears the grave diggers will remove
the body of his wife from the old ceme
tery on Main street, M. E. Lewis, four
score years of age, has pitched his tent
In the burial ground and stands guard
over his lot with a loaded rifle. Efforts
of the neighbors of the old man to get
him to return to his comfortable home
are of no" avail, as he has refused counsel
and will not stir from the home of the
dead.
Several months ago. the Town Trustees
closed the cemetery to further acceptance
of bodies and permission was given many
families to remove the bodies of their
relatives to the new burial place farther
from town. Lewis, who has zealously
planted flowers and cared for the lot in
which his wife is burled, supposed all the
bodies . would be removed.
Being superstitiously disinclined to see
the remains of his .wife reinterred, Lewis
warned people to beware of digging in
the place. ,. His mind, became fired with
hatred, it is saidi as the days passed, and
now he is spending his time In the ceme
tery living In a tent pitched on the lot
where his wife's remains are buried.
Mrs. Lewis died two years ago and
her aged husband has been suffering
from melancholia ever since.
No relatives of the old man are known
here, but if he can be induced to return
to his home the neighbors will care for
him, it is said. .

Enjoys the Confidence and
Love of His Countrymen
CHOICE FOB PRESIDENT
If the Norsemen Decide to
Overthrow the Monarchy
He Will Be Chosen Ruler
fr*<-'-Â»! Dieaatch to Th? Call.
CHRISTrAKTA: Sept. 9.â Norwegians
consider themselves particularly for
tunate that the present grave crisis
In their nation's career has produced a
mar. whom they .implicitly ,consider
equal to the emergency â Christian
Michelsen, Prime Minuter and "father
of independent Norway.- Pending de
cision ;is to the ultimate form which
the new Norwegian Government shall
tak*â whether monarchy or republic
J!ic!i^!sen is practical dictator of the
country: The Ministry of which he is
the head Is powerless 10 act without the
authority of the. Storthing (Parlia
ment), but Michelsen possesses the
hearts and confidence of his people to
*>o extraordinary an extent that his
\u25a0wil! is ss rood as law. If the Norse
men dtcJde to overthrow the monarchy
and set up a republic, Michelsen will be
the country's almost unanimous choice
lor President, though he has insisted
privately to his Intimate friends that
he cherishes no such ambition and
would shrink from anything savoring
cf telf-advancement or self-gratifica
tion.
MJchelsen is still a young man. He
Is not yet 4S years of age. Tall, broad
e.;oa!dered. square jawed and Roman
nosed, his physique spells strength
from head to foot. He is cool-headed,
reserved in manner and speech and
thoroughly conservative â attributes
one would expect In a man who has
been tried in the practical school of
â¢business life and attained success and
eminence in It.
REACHES A DECISION' aUICKLY.
Michelsen's father, a prominent Ber
gen merchant, designed him for a legal
career and he was graduated with high
honors from the law school of the Uni
versity of Christiania; but the shipping
trade, that bulwark of Norway's in
dustrial life, coon tempted him and at
22 he was already a factor in the navi
gation interests of his native city. He
founded the firm of Michelsen & Co.,
shipowners, which is now one of the
largest in Norway. Its vessels com
prise a good-sized mercantile marine of
their own and their flags flap in the
breezes of every busy port in the world.
Michelsen is several times a millionaire
and is one of Norway's "captains of In
dustry." Friends and business rivals
say that his ability to reach a decision
quickly â and to stick to it when
reached â has been the determining fac
tor of his success in trade, as it has
proved in politics and statesmanship.
At Bergen he has for years been known
as "Spot" Michelsen, because while other
ehipowr.ers have haggled and procras
tinated ever big deals and contracts Mi
chelsen acted on the "spot" â and got the
business. It is his way of tackling a prop
osition, as Sweden discovered to its sor
row, when he came to - the ministerial
fctiza at Christiania a few months agt> and
decided that the time for a reckoning
with King Oscar had come and could not
be deferred longer.
Michelsen was a pioneer in introducing
eteam power in the Norwegian mercantile
marine. He was among the first to dis
card sailing vessels as practicable ocean
carriers for modern shipping needs.
STUOXG MAX OF NORWAY.
This strong man of Norway entered
politics less than fifteen years ago and
within that time has risen to the highest
clUce within the gift of his countrymen.
Elected to the Storthing to represent his
native city of Bergen, he early became
associated with the negotiations with
Sweden for a regulation of the consular
question. His practical business experi
ence made him particularly well qualified
10 advance Norway's case ' for separate
Consulsâ the rock on which the union
with Sweoen finally broke two months
aÂ£o. His parliamentary record was es
tablished, however. In connection with the
project to build a state railway from
Bergen to Chrlstlania, a scheme costing
$12,u0u,000. For three years he fought for
this enterprise on the floor of the Stor
thing and nnally beat down all opposition
to it.
From that time he has been considered
one of Norway's real leaders and when
in the eprir.g of this year it became
necessary to stlcct a cabinet consisting
cf men of iron, to flgbt tne consular ques
tion with Sweden to a finish, Michelsen's
was the name on every Norwegian's lips
ep the figure around which the country's
ideals and hopes could Best be rallied.
He assumed office on the frank platform
cf a ditruption -of the union unless Nor
way's demands were unconditionally met.
and when Sweden's King: rejected ICoi;
v. t-y's proposals AlicheiÂ»un led the nation
bol&y on to the policy of secession and
eethronensent which has brought the
s-tr.cina-An nations to the brink of war
throughput the summer. '
"We. have not -committed revolution,"
eald MicheUen In conversation with The
Call correspondent at Christiania. "We
have gimply done what ivas necessary to
preserve our constitutional rights and
libertiesâ to Ineure our being masters in
our own houseâ and we are prepared for
all the consequences that our action may
precipitate."

FIRE DESTROYS
GRAIN ELEVATOR
Blaze Is Started by Spontan
eous Combustion in Wheat
Bin on the Top Floor
BUILDING A TOTAL LOSS
Scarcity of Water Makes' lt
Difficult for the Firemen
to Subdue the Flames
CHICAGO. Sept. 9.â The Santa Fe ele
vator, containing 545.000 bushels of grain,
was destroyed by fire to-day. Loss 5725,000,
fully insured.
The building was located at Twenty
seventh and Wood streets and was a flve
etory frame structure. The fire is thought
to have been started by spontaneous com
bustion In a wheat bin on the top story,
where an explosion was heard by the
workmen. Before the Fire Department
arrived the flames had made a way to the
first floor and were beyond control. The
firemen experienced difficulty in reaching
the flames and obtaining -water, although
twenty engines and two flre tugs were at
the scene.
The elevator was controlled by Harris
ScOtten & Co., grain brokers, and
was 1 valued at 5300,000. Forty or more
grain cars were standing on a sidetrack
and were moved under heavy risk by the
train crew and saved.
Within fifteen minutes after the fire had
been discovered the building was a mass
of flames. The heat was Intense and the
firemen were forced back from, the build-,
ing. An hour after the fire the floors
collapsed and later the sides of the build
ing gave way. Hundreds of bushels of
grain flowed into the river. The elevator
contained about 845,000 bushels of grain,
of which half was oats.
The fire was one of the most spectacular,
that has occurred In years. Large embers
were carried across the river to the
north and fell among the lumber piles in
the lumber yard of John Spry Lumber
Company, Hlnes Lumber Company and
the South Side Lumber Company. . To
prevent a repetition of the lumber yard
fire of IS9I five engine companies were
sent to the lumber yards to extinguish
several Email fires which had been started
by the flying embers.

I this particular floor covered a good deal, of ground and that it was closely packed with merchandise, ; but within the very short period- of two-
I years both the space and:^ the quantity of goods; it ;contairie(i; became inadequate to meet the wants^ of Â± Pragers great army, of Satisfied^
Customers. \t became* necessary to lease ahe -//.four^remaining floors, / ' and^ the big Murphy Office; building was transformed into the'
I iargest department store in the West This splendid record of expansion stands alone in the annals; of' San Francisco retail stores, as there
has never been such an immense^acquisition of space in so ; short a time.

Los Angeles Woman Lashes
Daughters Insulter While
Policeman Guards the Door
IX)S ANGELES. Sept. 9â While a big
policeman stood guard outside the
door, with his back discreetly turned,
Mrs. Amos C. Wilklns this afternoon
curled a blacksnake whip with terrible
force around, the writhing form of a
young masher who had Insulted her
little daughter. She gave him a dozen
lashes that left red and blue rings
around his body.
The insult was given on the street
near the child's home and as the little
one ran into the house crying, her
mother caught sight of the culprit and
an officer. She told the latter the cir
cumstances and he took the -wretch
Into the house before the Irate woman,
who demanded his arrest. \u25a0 The wretch
tremblingly admitted all and offered to
apologize. The patrolman would not
arrest. She demanded ! that he thrash
him and again the. bluecoat demurred,
saying he might lose his' job.
"Step outside the door and don't hear
anything," commanded Mrs. Wilkins.
"I. have a mule whip and Til thrash
him myself." The patrolman obeyed.
"Stand in the middle of the room,"
he heard the woman's sharp voice com
mand. Then he could hear the "ping*
of the blacksnake and the shufflins of
the young man's feet- as he cried and
jumped with pain. \u25a0.-â¢":"
Mrs. Wllkins lashed her victim^ un
til hegroaned 'In 'anguish 1. ahd'lshe* was
exhausted. It so happened that' | the
masher's mother came along "just ;^. as
the young man emerged and 9 the po
liceman had difficulty agaiu.'>.Bnt ;,tbe
two 'women went In, cried together and
forgave. It was agreed that the mash
er's name should never be disclosed.
Captain of Police Auble sustained the
policeman in his course throughout.

Prepares a Table Showing
Small Percentage of ; '
Births. : Of . V
PITTRBURa, Sept. B.â A table" of the
deaths and births in Pittsburg '. during'
the past 14, years, prepared by City
Physician Dr. B. A. Booth, for the Bu
reau of Health, shows a. startling de
crea6Â« In . the number of ; births, not
withstanding a large increase In popu
lation, la 1891 there were 7067 births,
the rate per 1000 being 28.61.
In , ; the same year there were
5Â£S2 deaths, the rate per 1000 being
23.61. The table is complete to the end
of 1504. and shows a decrease in the
birth rate to 21.74. more than 7 per
cent. The death rate Is decreased from
23.61 to 19.70 from 1891 to 1904. .
The figures for the first three months
of this year are surprising. In 1891 the
excess of births over deaths. was 1235.
The figures for this year Indicate that
the excess of births has been wiped out
and the conditions are reversed, there
being a decrease of twenty-three births
over the death rate.
In. commenting upon the report. Dr.
Booth said:
- 'The figures- show -that race suicide
Is a fact, and I think more so in Pitts
burg than in any of the larger cities of
the country.'V
SWISS RAVE PASSION' PL.AY
THAT BUT FEW PEOPLE SEE
GENEVA, Sept 9.â ln the' quaint lit
tle village of Selzach, which Is situated
in the Canton of Soleure, -about- twenty
minutes by train from r Blenne, a t pas
sion play Is enacted every Sunday dur-
ing the entire season.
The setting of the play, which was
first produced In 1893, is very simple)
and the actors, to. the number of 400,
are all inhabitants of Selzach andithV
neighboring villages. There are : no
grand scenic effects nor talented-act
ing, as at Oberammergau; but the sa
cred scenes, are produced simply and
faithfully, with great effect. """*
Though the Swiss flock thither from
all parts of the country, very few Eng
lish or American visitors are to be seen
there, for the play is not advertised,
nor is it run on commercial lines.' The
play is worth witnessing on account of
its .simplicity and, its directness of ap
peal. ,\ --. â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0-;â¢:\u25a0 \u25a0 "- \u25a0 ' - ;. ;; v ;':
â¢The performance is divided Into two
parts, with an .- interval of two hours
between the two- representations. ,The
first portion, which consists; of -twenty
scenes, takes place in the morning, and
treats of the life of Jesus .up .to; the
entry in Jerusalem. -In 'theVaftern6on i
the actual representation of .the passion'
is given with a' precision and exact!-'
tude all German. The singing arid
music are much above the average, and
the performers are all chosen for their
fine physique.
The passion play is encouraged rby
the church authorities, and the profits
â which are small, as the charges are
very moderate â go to charities.

In the office of District Attorney Seymour
are running high and the hope exists that
each Incoming mall will bring word from
Joseph Jordan that he is packed to start
back to the scene of his disgrace to aid
in the \u25a0 effort to send his associates in
bribery to the penitentiary. ' However no
definite word has yet reached the District
Attorney, though it Is fully expected to
morrow. ?
Ex-Senator E. J. Emmons, who will go
to trial Monday morning, has not yet
made his appearance. His absence, ..how
ever,'ls believed to be due to bis desire to
permit as many; Native Sons and Daugh
ters as possible to get out of- the city at
the conclusion of the carnival that the
curious lines he will pass between on his
way -to court may â¢ be diminished in
numbers., s . ..-, -,

unless something /.unforeseen occurs | the
work of., selecting ._ a ';." jury, will begin
prompty i at ' 10 o'clock Monday morning.
The fact that "Wright's new bondsmen
were beginning to display some appre\
henslon led to the belief in* the Sheriffs
office that he would return here again
to-day as a prisoner. He did not come,
however, and this Is taken to mean that
he has re-established confidence in the
minds of his bondsmen that he will- not
flee from the ordeal that confronts him.

NEW PLAY MAY
MAKE A HIT
Forbes Eobertson Believes
He Will Score a Big Suc
cess with "The Conqueror"
REAL POWER IN PLAY
Drama Will Be Produced
in London Next Week and
Is Expected to Go Well
SpecUl Dlsi>atch to The CalL
LONDON. Sept. 9.â One is rather in
clined to counsel American play-goers to
look out^for reviews of the new play
which ITorbes Robertson is getting ready
to produce In London, for it. seems likely
to prove a bit out of the ordinary.. In
which case congratulations will be in
order, this actor's luck, of late, having
been distinctly bad. Hia production of
"The Light That Failed." though moder
ately successful here, was ,not liked by
American audiences. Then London
frowned on 'â¢The Edge of the Storm,"
which Forbes Robertson brought back
with him from the United States, and
almost as chilly a reception seems to have
been meted out to "Love and the Man,"
the Esmond piece which he tried on his
latest tour in America.
There have been reports from the in-
Eide, however, . that "Morven," as the
four-act play is called with which Robert
sou will open the new Scala, was believed
by every one who had read it to be a
long way out of the ordinaryâ a work. In
fact, that might be expected to make
something of a sensation on both sides
of the water, and it seemed worth while
to get some details regarding it from the
prospective producer himself.
AUTHOR'S XAME X' SECRET.
As a result it can be eaid that this
pieceâ whose author prefers to remain
anonymous for the presentâ is likely to be
renamed "The Conqueror" when pro
duced at the Scala on September 16, and
that it is a romantic drama in blank
verse. Stephen Phillips is about the only
dramatist who has had any success with
this medium, of recent years, but it is
really no ordinary theme that has in
spired the forthcoming play, and if the
workmanship is adequate there seems lit
tle doubt that something really interest
ing is In store for play-goers *on both
sides of the water.
"I have 'every intention," said Forbes
Robertson, when seen at the Scala yes
terday, "of producing 'Morven' or 'The
Conqueror' In the United States if it ful
fills my hopes here. And 1 may say that
these are very high, indeed. The story ot
the playâ which is .medievalâ is- one of
beauty and real power. The conqueror is
a captain of war who has swept through
the country with fire and sword. Rapine
and lust have had full play. But just as
the drama opens the conqueror feels that
he is beginning to tire of such victories,
and when he sees the young daughter of
the chieftain whose stronghold he has
Just captured â who is, indeed, the one liv
ing thing left in the castle â he feels more
than ever the emptiness of his triumphs.
And yet she is only a child. He will go
away for eight years, and then will return
to claim her for himself.
MILL PLAY LEADIXG PART. \u25a0
"So the conqueror goes, but in the mean
time, some years afterward, another comes
to her, one strangely like the conqueror
yet, indeed, he is no conqueror, but the
conqueredâ flying from the sword' of the
ever victorious captain. But Morven
thinks it is the other. She listens to him
and loves him. And when the conqueror
returns, bring her captive kings and
princes and the wealth of the world in
Jewels to lay. at her feet, he finds that
the prize he had denied himself for eight
long years has fallen to another.
"The successful wooer is condemned to
die, but Morven wins his life from the
conqueror. He spares her lover and de
stroys himself. Then a miracle happensâ
which, however, I am keeping a secret
for my first-night audience. The play
ends interrogatively, and the question re
maining for the living lover is whether
he has not in winning lost allâ whether
the conqueror in dying has not won that
which, living, he could not gainâ the love
of the woman.
"I am to play the conqueror," said Rob
ertson, "and my wife. Miss Gertrude El
liott, will be the heroine, .Morven, while
for the young lover I have engaged Hen
ry Ainley, who made so great a success
as Paolo in Phillips' play of 'Paolo and
Francesca,' and who scored another suc
cess in Zangwill's piece, 'Merely Mary
Ann.*
CHARGE OF PLAGIARISM.
Tempted by the uncommonly pleasing
experience of his friend, W. W. Jacobsâ
whose "Beauty and the . Barge" will be
done in thÂ« United States by Nat Goodwin
this seasonâ Arthur Morrison Is the latest
British novelist to go into the play writ
ing .business. 'â¢ Like Jacobs, Morrison will
begin by putting some of his own stories
on the stage, the first' of which will be
"Cunning V Murrell." This story, novel
readers will remember. , was , singularly
unlike its author's earlier works, "The
Child of the Jago" and "Tales of Mean
Streets"â its -scene being laid in. rural
England and its hero being a sort gof
modern sorcerer, a wizard and charlatan,
who gets a living. by selling charms, love
philters and 80 on. Cyril Maude, who
has just left the Haymarket to go -into
management on his own account, has
commissioned the dramatization of "Cun
ning Murrell." It it succeeds there Is a
possibility that -forrison may try his
hand at a stase version of his detective
story. "The Red Triangle." l .
Following the famous "Clngalee case.
I hear that another sensational charge of
plagiarism is about to be brought in Lon
don. The piece which, it concernsâ a
musical oneâ was among the most suc
cessful given in London In tecent times;
it was withdrawn some little while' ago.
The plaintiffs will be the authors of a
French play, who claim that the plot of
the English piece was "conveyed" from
theirs, without authority and without
payment. They will sue for damages for
fees, and will. I hea r. demand a - large
sum.

STOCK MARKET
CLOSES WEAK
Restored Confidence of

EASING OFF IN PEICES
Eadical Changes in Yarions

9 - . ' .
NEW YORK. Sept 9.â The restored oon
fldence over the money market which
caused the rally In stocks yesterday was
somewba^ Impaired again when trading
was resumed to-day. An active bear
party put out short lines freely in various
Quarters of the market. There was some
covering from this source after the bank
statement appeared, but prices eased ! off
again before the closing as the radical
changes in the various items of the bank
statement were not liked in spite of the
small impairment of the surplus which
was made to show as a net result.
The bank statement, in faot, showed a
much easier loss of cash than the most
liberal estimates of the preliminary com
putations. The highest of these had run
to ?5,500,000, while the decrease shown by
the bank j statement runs to nearly . $11,
000,000. In order to effect the necessary
reduction in the deposit item to keep pace
with this heavy loss of cash and conserve
the surplus the clearing-house banks had
marked down the average of the loan

The decline in deposits thus affected
amounts for the week to $41,165,100. These
changes are far in excess of the reduc
tions made in previous weeks in the his
tory of the clearing-house.
The trust companies have alone taken
over large loans during the. week. The
break in foreign exchange has been due
to the borrowing of funds in foreign mar
kets. It is reported that some Western
institutions have also placed large loans
in New York this week, and the upward
course of New York exchange at Chicago
bears out this supposition. The compara
tive tranquillity of the call money market
Is supposed to be due in a large measure
to shifting of stock market borrowing
from call loans into time loans. The mar
ket closed unsettled and irregular and
very dull. Total sales of bonds, par value,

THOKOUGH CLEANING
FOR HONOLULU GITY
Acting Governor Asks for the
Aid of the Federal
Government.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call
HONOLULU. Sept. " 9.â A' Federal
saniary commission" to' clean up the
cit J^ of Honolulu, much the same as
Havana was cleaned with such good
results after the war with Spain, is be
ing asked for by Acting - Governor
Atkinson In correspondence with Pres
ident Roosevelt. " :
Atkinson is suggesting that In view
of the dangers of disease from Panama,
Honolulu, as , the calling place , of most
American steamships which' cross , the
Pacific, should receive special attention
in health matters. He suggests as
commissioners an army engineer, a
Quarantine officer and a Honolulu at
torney, and urges that such ' a com
mission be appointed with' general'in
structions to. thoroughly, clean the; city
and',make v It sanitary. ;' The ; Territory
has done, a' lot of work along these
lines, says the acting Governor, and
the Board of Health Is still active, but
he. thinks that the situation justifies
Federal assistance at least if not as
sumption of. all the burden by the Fed
eral Government . " - >
\u25a0-;â¢ Direct â steamship communication
with . Panama . will be established early
next â¢ year and* the sanitary ; condition

GRIM WRECKAGE OF BAKU
Scenes of Indescribable Des
truction in Oil District.
Troops Obtain Mastery Over
Ferocious Tartar Bands.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 10. 3:20 a.
mm â The situation at Baku yesterday
showed a slight but perceptible change
for the better. Dispatches received
here indicated that the rioters had
made no headway in their attempts at
Incendiarism in the "Black Town"
quarter, where comparative order was
restored, and only a few shots were be
ing fired. Beveral banks had reopened.
Oil men. escorted by the troops, were
able for the ttrst time to visit the fields,
which for four days had been practically
la the hands of the Tartars. They re
port scenes of indescribable destruction.
About three-quarters of the property
there, they say, was burned to the
ground and plundering and incendiar
ism continued. Hundreds of tanks were
destroyed, the pumping machinery Is
useless and the houses of the workmen
were destroyed. It is impossible to fix
accurately the losses sustained, but
rebuilding operations will take half a
year if the workmen return immedi
ately.
One of the oil men estimated the
number of dead at more than 1000, half
of whom were killed in the city during
the eaily rioting, but he admitted that
the estimate was only a guess.
AJthou&h the loss in ihe oil fields had
been reported as total, the St. Peters
burg representative' of the Baku Bourse
committee declared that, after an in
spection .of all the telegrams received
by the oil men here, not a single refin
ery in "Black Town" had been burned
and that that important department of
the oil Industry, was not touched.'
The troops are reported as being
tired, owing to their continued exer
tions, but fresh reinforcements are re
lieving them.
A. member of the staff of the hospital
at Balakhan, where all the patients
were reported to have been massacred,
telegraphs that the staff of doctors and
the patients are all safe.

message to the authorities here, say
ing that the devastation and resultant
misery at Shusha is appalling. The

Mr. Brjaii Is a pionttr. lie has lived in sight

years ht was postmastfr of Colma, a email
place Just outside of San Francisco, which at
the present time is prominently before the
r-uhlie. Mr. Bryan iÂ« also a Notary Public
and Is well and favorably known in and about

the limit of Mr. Bryan's physical suffering.
Ke found this trouble retting a strong hold
upon him, however, and when the disease be-
gan to locate in tne region of the heart he de-
cided upon prompt action, and. having heard
cf the success of Electro-Chemistry in curing
â¢eemingly incurable eases of rheumatism of
ail varieties, he decided upon this treatment
for biroself.
In speaking of his cure, Mr. Bryan says:
"I did not feÂ«l like poisoning my system with
strong drugs, that seldom cure rheumatism
anyway, bo I took the Electro-Chemlc course.
I only took the treatment for about a month.

have sent a good many frienda to the Institute
for the treatment, and I eball continue to
recommend it to all eufferer*. My own cure,
and the cure cf friend* suffering from different
ajiment*. gives me every confidence in its ef-
â¢ ficacy." . . .
In the distressing ailment* of women, which
so frequently send the pufferer to the operating
table, the curative powers of Electro-CtiemiKry
are marvelous. No woman, no matter what
I her trouble may be. should think of undergo-
ing surgical treatment before Investigating

Chemistry is accomplishing in bad female dis-
orders.
Electro-Chemistry cures cancer*, tumor*-, dis-
placements, irregular and painful , periods,
weakness, headache, backache, nervousness.

ringing ears and head noise*, almost hopeless
cases have been promptly cured, and in the
milder cases it never rail.. Testimonials and
reference* to cured patients will be gladly fur-
r.l*hed to any on* wishing them. In all stom-
ach, liver and bowel disease*, especially in
those bad cases where the patient has been
compelled to take cathartic medicines' for a
long time, Electro-Chemistry cures from the
very beginning moet serious and long land-
ing cases. Thi* is also true in bad kidney
and bladder troubles and In special diseases of
men. Young men who are nervous and suf-
fering from weakness and loss of nervous and

after medical treatments have absolutely
failed. In old. men suffering from proetatic

the fusillade Friday night was cannon
firing and that houses were still burn
ing. In the "black town" and the
works comparative quiet reigns.
Another Baku dispatch says flres and
murder do not cease, despite the for
mal armistice. About 1500 tartars, it
is announced, have been killed or
wounded.
The oil men met to-day and resolved
not to reopen their works until the
right to keep private guards for the
protection of their property is granted
by the Government. -.-; ;
Additional reinforcements are urg
ently needed. The troops now at Baku
are powerless to control the wild, fa
natic Tartars who resist the troops en
ergetically. Attempts made v to recon
cile the Armenians and Tartars have
been unsuccessful. ...;v ,
The Baku catastrophe leaves no al
ternative to Southern Russia than the
use of coal instead of oil in : a large
part of the factories and railroads. The
furnishing of sufficient coal, however,
Is very difficult on account of the scar
city of rolling stock on the railroads,
cars having been withdrawn from ttie
regular service throughout European
Russia to carry supplies and men to
Manchuria. A temporary reduction of
the removal of duty on coal is pro
posed.
UIGA STRIKE CALLED OFF.
Socinl Democratic Committee Tells tbe
.Men to Return to Work.
RIGA, Sept. 9.â The end of the gen
eral strike here was announced to-day
by a manifesto issued by the Social
Democratic Committee.. The manifesto
recites that the Sociaist movement in
Russia brought about the end of the
war and effected great improvements in
the conditions of the workingmen
through the land. The new National
Assembly, it is also claimed, is due to
the Social Democrats.
The committee commends the work
ingmen to return to work, enough hav
ing been accomplished for the present.

MOBGAX SYNDICATE
\u25a0AFTER -COAL -MIXES
Negotiating- to Purchase De
sirable Properties in
Manchester.
LOXDOX, Sept. 9.â Some time ago It
was reported here that an American
I syndicate was operating In Lancashire
I with the view of buying up some half
j a dozen coal mines in the immediate
j neighborhood of Manchester. The ne
gotiations fell t-hrough for want of
sufficient : capital, but now the same
syndicate Is endeavoring to acquire a
few mines in another part of the coun
try. This time the promoters will have
the financial backing of J. Pierpont
Morgan and a few of his London
friends who are- associated with him
in his North East London "tube"
scheme. Harry P. Whitney is also one
of the leading spirits of the syndicate.
The operation of this "tube" railway,
the bill for which, after a long and bit
ter fight against it, passed the House
of Lords recently, will necessitate a
vast electrical generating station. That,
of course, will consume large quantities
of coal, and if the syndicate is able
to obta'n the coal at first cost from Its
own mines a grea,t initial saving will
be effected in this" heavy item of ex
pense.
In another way. it is believed by
those financially interested in the; pro
ject, the mines could be made profit
able. Many of the cotton cargo steam
ers and cattle boats that reach Liver
pool and Manchester have to; return to
America in ballast- It is proposed to
load them with coal, which they could
carry at nominal cost. This coal." It is
said, could i then be utilized on the Mor
gan steamers. > It \u25a0> is even suggested
that, despite the high -American tariff,
under' such exceptional circumstances
considerable portions of. the' coal; could
be sold at a profit- In the American
market. In the working of the mines
the latest and most economical ; meth
ods and labor-saving devices will, be
employed, with the;result s that;the"coal
will be mined much cheaper than is
ordinarily done In England. The mines
whose purchase the syndicate is now
considering will cost at the .lowest es
timate $15,000,000.-

Paul Steindorff received a great ovation
last night at the new Louvre, Powell and

as leader of the orchestra at that popular
cafe. At 6 o'clock he was: tendered a
banquet by forty members of ; the ! Ger

magnificently^ decorated board, set at the
western end of main hall. The table
was decked with a wealth of superb
roses and great bunches of long-stemmed
pink lilies. During .the banquet Stein
dorff was presented" with two' gorgeous
laurel wreaths, tied with streamers of
red, white and blue ribbons. These were
from the Owl and German clubs.. Stein

REVIEWS EVIDENCE ;

Lawyer Wertz Accuses Fort
escne of Evading the
Truth. :;
Sp*dal \u25a0 Dispatch to-ThÂ» Call.
WOOSTER. Ohio; Sept. 9.â Attorney
Wertz concluded his argument for the
: plaintiff in the Taggart divorce case a
few minutes before adjournment. Wertz
reviewed the testimony and the substance
of the charges against Mrs. Taggart-
S peaking of affairs at Fort Leavenworth
he said: ..
'â¢Mrs. Miner called on Mrs. Taggart but
once during - her whole stay at Fort
Leavenworth. Common, courtesy " de
manded that. After Mrs. Taggart's cotil
lion she should have, made a party call
on Mrs."" Miner and the fact that she did
not ' call; shows that she was suspicious
of, her husband's infidelity."
â¢. Speaking of Fortescue, Wertz; said:
iVMrs. Taggart says -she never smoked
cigarette. said she did. Now,
if ; Fortescue ,is lying, what Is he lying
about? .They claim Hirschler .was in ;the
cellar that night with Fortescue and-Mrs.
Taggart after ice. Now,- If he was really
, there, why did "they neglect such an im-
portant matter and not get his deposition
or have him there to testify? Ha la at
Fort Leavenworth and can easily be
reached."
In the few minutes occupied by Judge
Smyser h* said:
"In my. opening statement a few weeks
ago I said: Thank God! the hour has
come when we can have vindication In
the limelight of publicity.* In all the
days of this trial there has not been,
with one exception, a single word In the
public press favorable to my client. Xow,
thank God.' the hour has come when not
the newspapers but your Honor will de
cide this case. I don't know whether the
press is subsidized or not, but I know that
all the papers, with but onÂ© exception,
have been on the side of the plaintiff.
But let us turn to my client. Who is
there who can say that there ever ran,
for a single moment through this wom
an's head one thought of. disloyalty to
her husband?"

IS BOY'S BED
Ten-Year-Old Robert Larber
Found Asleep in -Packing
Ca^e on - the Sidewalk
IJUNS AWAY FROM HOME
Tells Police He Does Not
Want to Return to Father,
but Will Shift for Himself
OAKXAiCD, Sept. B.â Curled up in a
dry goods box. which has been his only
home for the last four nights. RQbert
Larber, a ten-year-old boy who ran away
from Ibis home at 240 Louisa, street last
Tuesday, was found, fast asleep last
night: by Police Officer Poulter. When
takes to the police station the boy said
he had slept In the box every night since
he left home, and that in the daytime
he had worked for a peddler.
Young Larber sturdily maintained that
he was entirely able to take care of him
self, and protested against being held at
the station to await the arrival of his
lather, as he said that he did not want
to go home. The. little fellow said that
the reason he left home was because he
could. not get along with his brother. He
declared that when they quarreled and
fought ' his mother always took the part
of his brother, although the latter Is the
older ; of the two by a year.
Robert told the officers and jailer that
whenever his brother hit him it was all
right; but that If he returned the blow
he was always punished by his mother,
and it was to get away from this unjust
punishment that he at last decided to run
away, and ehlft for himself.
When he left the home of his parents
last Tuesday Robert came directly to tne
business district of the city, and after
a 6hort search for employment secured
a Job with a fruit peddler. As the meager
\u25a0wages he received would not suffice to
pay for a room in addition to his board,
the boy had spent the four nights in the
box in* which he was discovered asleep
by the officer.
The boy Is the son of John Larber,
a tailor, and is extremely sturdy and in
dependent for his age. He said that he
did not intend to be satisfied with what
he was doing, and was on the lookout for
a better job, so that he would not have
to sleep out of doors, and he says that
if he had not been arrested he would have
been able to make his own way without
any trouble. He was returned to' his
father this m'oriftng.

LAWYER PLAYS FALSE
TO CONFIDING CLIENT
After Accepting; Retainer Leaves the
Case to Another.
A lawyer tells how he once played a
client false. . "I shall have to make a
lawyer out of that boy of mine.' I
don't see any other.; way out of it,"
declared the well-known attorney with
a laugh. â¢
"He came Into my of ice on the way\
home from school and laid a ' nickel
down on the desk before me. "What IS
this for, son? 1 I asked. 'Retainer,' he
answered soberly.. 'Very well,* said I,
entering into the joke, 'what, have I
been retained' upon?" My. hoy dug
down into his pocket and produced a
note : from his teacher and placed it
before me without comment. It : was to
the effect, that he had been 'cutting up*
and advised a whipping.
" 'Now, what would you advise?* he
asked in a business-like voice." after "I
had. read, the note and saw the trap
that young rascal led me into. "I
think that our first move should be
to apply for a change of venue,' said* I.
'Very . well,*, he answered. . 'you're han
dling the case.* â¢ (
"â¢Then we will turn the note over to
your .'mother,' said L I saw the : yqung
imp's face fall at this, but he T braced
up and. said, 'See ' here, pop, you're
bound to see me . through on this,
'cause you've accepted my retainer,
you know!' ' 'I'll argue your case be
fore the court,' I answered, 'but you'll
have " to ; accept the decision. I would
not dare- to attempt to influence the
court.*
"Well, I pleaded .the boy's case,
promptly had it thrown out of . court
ur.d the boy got what he deservedâ a.
good whipping.- It was the first time
I ever played false to a client," â De

LEGAL WEAPONS
FOR CHURCHMEN
Inj unction Proceedings Are
Planned b^ : Faction of
Berkeley; < : vPresbyterians
OPPOSE SALE OF CHURCH
Conference Held by Minority
to Discuss Ways to Cir
cumvent Plans of Majority
BERKELEY, Sept. 9. â An important
meeting of prominent Presbyterians of
Berkeley who oppose the sale of the
First Presbyterian Church to" the Trin
ity Methodist Episcopal Church,: as
agreed upon by a majority of the con-!
grfg-ation last Tuesday night, was held ,
this afternoon at the home of |
Fairbanks, 2420 Ellsworth street. As
a result of this conference injunction
proceedings will probably be begrun
when the first move Is made in court
by the 'opposition church members' to
dispose of the property on Allston way.
.'. a; Pinkerton and Rev. Mr. War
net of Xorth Berkeley attended this
conference and strongly advocated the
procuring of an injunction to stop the
sale on the ground that a part of the
congregation proposed to sell the prop
erty for much less than Its real worth.
It was finally decided to procure legal
advice, by which the minority faction
In the church may be guided In its ef-^
forts to defeat the will of the major
ity. The old split in the church con
gregation, originally wide and pro
nounced, threatens to become a chasm
at the rate the rift is : increasing, as
judging by the expressions at the con
ference this afternoon every measure
possible to devise will be employed to
spoil the plans of the members who
want to dispose of the church' building
to the Methodists.
' MIZVOIUTV IS DETERMIMID.
Last Tuesday night, after a stormy
session in which scores of proxies were
: used, the congregation decided by . a
| vote of 227 to 104 to sell the church
property to the Trinity Methodist Epis
copal Church for $25,000. Two months
ago the trustees of the Methodist and
the Presbyterian churches agreed to a
transfer of the property for $22,500.
Then the faction of Presbyterians
which objects to leaving its old church
home on' Allston^way arose .and said
'"Nay â not less than $30,000 can be ac-.
cepted." A meeting of the congrega
tion was called, the $22,500 offer was
rejected and at a later meeting held
this week a $25,000 proposal was ac
cepted. \u25a0â¢_ " .Â» '\u25a0\u0084
The triumphant majority, however,
has a determined minority to deal with,
and this minority^proposes,.to exhaust
every resource lnv preventing the will
of its opponents.
While financial.- reasons, will be v cited
as proof.; of the i impropriety; of the
sale of the rhurch, it is known that
sentimental reasons have,.- influenced
scores of those who object to the sale.
Those who have worshiped In the beau
tiful old church for years, who helped
build it and have contributed memorial
windows for their dead and witnessed
many a historic church event in Its
four walls, declare that it will be like
tearing at heart strings to part with
all that is dear to them in the church.
GAVE MEMORIAL. WINDOW.
Mrs. H. McDonald of 2224 Chapel
street is one of those, who contributed
memorial windows, her husband having
been the subject of the memorial ex
pression. She is too deeply affected by
the proposal to turn the church over
to another body of Christians, even to
discuss the matter. Her hope la. that
Mr. Fairbanks, Mr. Pinkerton. Dr. War
ner, Mr. Jungck and other male mem
bers who also * oppose the sale will
eventually succeed in stopping it. .
In court when permission is asked
to sell the property the argument that
may be advanced by the opponents of
the proceeding will Include a declara
tion that the value of the church prop-*
erty is very much more than the
$25,000 which the Methodists have been
asked to give. It will be shown in
event of court proceedings that the
property is worth almost double , that
sum, and so the court will be asked,
in this contingency, to forbid the sale
as a protection to the equity of the
minority Involved.
The Methodists . have agreed, it is
said, to let the Presbyterians retain
the use of the building for a year in
event of a sale, while a- new. home for
the Presbyterian ; congregation could
be constructed. 'This; concession, 'how
ever, \u25a0 has â¢ not â¢ pacified the opponents
of the sale proposition.

on or ' along the African * coast, from
using his resular crew as boatmen. He
is / entitled ; to . enlist "Krumen," ,or

of Infantry, NVG. C, in the Mechanics'
Pavilion on the evening of Thursday,
September 21. have been completed, and
the indications are at this time that the
affair by the regiment that volunteered to
go to the front during the Spanish-Amer
ican war and was the first to go to for
eign territory in defense of the flag of this
country will be one of the grandest In
that iinc ever got up In this city. A l*rge
T>ror r "iion of the 10,000 tickets that have
-\u25a0been primed for this military event have
been already disposed of. and from the
liberality manifested to further the enter
tainment, which will be for the benefit of
the patriotic First, it looks as if the com
mittee will have to obtain at least 5000
Oiore tickets.
'Tht exercises for that night will include
ell kinds of military athletics as practiced
lii the United States army at tOurna-
Bipnif, and h review by the commander
in chief. Governor Pardee. who during
tJie evening 1 will present a stand of colors
to tho r*-jrirti^r,t. In addition to this there
be various frames and then dancing.
The arrar.srrment of the details is in the
bands of a committee composed of Cap
tain 11. G. Mulhev.son, regimental adju
tant;: Captain Alexander McCulloch and
Lieutenant D. A. Hagrens. .

Interesting data relative to members *of
Company C. He says: "In a recent is*ue
cf The Call there was an item about the
record, of a faithful guardsman who had
â¢crved his State for twenty years, and
the capUon of the article was, 'Who Can
Ueat This Record?" Away up in the foot
hills of the Sierras, isolated from the oth
er companies of the National Guard of
thp State, is Company C. Second Infan
try, located in Nevada City, which was
organized April IS, ISÂ«>3.
"Nearly every business man in Nevada
City at one time or another has served
a three-year enlistment in this company,
c.nd all feel proud of the service each
r'l s rendered the State. Each one is en
j i lied to credit fcr what he did. Were it
rot for the fact that some years ago this
company had the misfortune to have its
records destroyed by lire it would be a
pleasure to write from these in order to
chow the service of many of its members,
who have 'a faithful record of service to
the State of more than twenty years.'
But without this record a few instances
may be mentioned.
KOKTV-TWO YEARS HIS RECORD.
"Private J. C. RishilL, a member of the
company and for years its quartermaster,
\u25a0was one -of the charter members, having
er.listed April IS,' I>E3, and shows a record
of more than forty-two years of continu
ous service. Private James Hockley. once a

May, ISG4, showing a record of more than
forty years of rontinnous service. PrivaXe:
D. B. Getehell, once second lieutenant.
enlisted in August. 1564, and there, are
others whose continuous service to the
State extends over a period of more than
thirty years, and others whose service
passes the twenty years limit. Among
these may be mentioned Private J. C.
Dean, Corporal Levi \V. Nicholson and
Captain B. A. Bost. We have many ten
and fifteen year medal men in our ranks.
V.'c are proud of being one of the oldest

that we have so many tried_ old guards

claims to be Helen Butler, but is in
"reality the wlte of a man named An

ducted a place , of questionable char

is said that one ,"of the inmates of the
place, known tbÂ»the police as '/Dutch
Annie," gave birth to a child while
"Minnie LiOe' conducted the place. -.At
that time the Lee woman said: v. ..
"You bet I would make- "some mil
lionaire pay for it." '
v -Dutch Annie" never made any such
attempt, so far as the police know, or'
if any such attempt was made it was
completely hushed up. It is believed,
howtver, that the Lee woman â¢ made
several attempts, selecting /Myron T.

"Two or three years ago a woman,
whom I- had. never seen before, came

of my attorney. . He engaged the ser

NELSON DEFEATS BRITT IN EIGHTEEN ROUNDS
A GREAT CROWD WILDLY CHEERING THE VICTOR
Battling Nelson defeated Jimmy Britt decisively at Gdlma; yesterday^M rounds Britt cast all his science and
cleverness as a boxer aside and played into his ty landed 'countless blows, chiefly
about the head, bt/t they had \nc y effect on the Dq7ie, who kepi bon^ efforts.

of Punishment During the Battle.
His Ceaseless Advance in Face of Fire Eroves.
to Be Utterly Irresistible.
Eddie Graney Is Chosen to Referee Bout After
Spectators Abandon All Hope.
Battling Nelson lived up to the name his fond parents bestowed upon him at his chrisfeningan
far-away Denmark and also to his title of the "hardest nut in the profession to crack .by causing
Jimmy Britt, .the premier lightweight of the coast, to strike his colors yesterday in the open-air
ring yesterday at Colma.
The end came somewhat unexpectedly in the 'eighteenth round. Britt was breaking groundat
the time, but was not. in such dire distress as had marked his condition at various stages of ;the 'fig^t-
He ' was backing away from Nelson, and' had reached his own corner, when ;the Dane -caught /him a
comparatively light blow with his left glove on the jaw. This was -followed;by^the:right:"atalrriqst
GOES DOWMTO DEFEAT WRITHING IN JlGOtiY.
Britt sank tp the canvas-covered ring and rolled over tm His stomach. He 'writhed ; about in
apparent agony and in an effort to regain his scattered thoughts. One could- 'imagine the prostrate
hoxen^saw. the great world whirling about him. and everything in mad confusion.. As his senses re
turned-To 'liim slowly, he made an effort to arise. " "-".,'
The implacable timekeeper tolled off the seconds, and Britt had caught -the lower.rope of : the
ring- just' as the ten-seconds allowed by the ; Queensberry /rules elapsed. 1 . > V".
The victorious Dane seemed to know the power behind, the blow he had^delivered. He took
one look at Britt as he lay on the floor, arid then walked toward his corner, apparently; the /coolest
man in the assemblage. . â¢' ,
HUSH COMES OVER THE VAST ASSEMBLAGES
There was a hush over the great crowd as Britt went down, the majority of the spectators
apparently expecting him. to regain his feet and continue the struggle. But^in'.an.instarit the spec
tators grasped the situation, and before Britt had been counted out they were cheering the new. star
in the boxing firmament. The crowd made a rush for - the ring and \u25a0\u25a0 overwhelmed the victori
ous fighter with congratulations. ..
Nelson's remarkable capacity, to take punishment was never more in evidence. Britt hit.him
with all his force on jaw and head and body, but there .was no stopping his advances. -The Dane was
effective only in the close work, where his blows had teiling,effect:The blow with which; he didvthe
most execution was a left hook to .the^head. Each time this landed it distressed Britt, who seemed
unable to withstand punishment about the head. . .
BRITT LACKING IN HIS USUAL GENERALSHIP.
Without detracting from Nelson's brilliant and hard won victory,' it is ;only fair to say fÃritt
did not show the judgment and the ring generalship which has carried him through, his other fights.
He had confidence in his ability to knock Nelson out, . and . from ; the first tap '-of-^^ the gong he -bent: all
his efforts to accomplish the feat.
In his eagerness to score a clean-cut victory Britt played .directly /into the hands of his oppo
nent, unconsciously shaping his campaign in the ring oh the lines which made the Dane unusually ef
fective. The latter was able to do the most damage at close range, and Britt; in his endeavor to' lajid
the decisive blow, kept in, close. Nelson would take an incredible number, of BrittV blows aixmtfthe
head in order to land one; but that one invariably shook up Britt.
CASTS ALL HIS BOXING SKILL TO WINDS.
Britt foolishly cast aside all his, boxing skill and depended on, mere slugging. /In .addition to
this, he aimed the major portion of his blows at Nelson's head, where they; seemed to have : the least ef
fect. At times he would rip in a left to the jbpdv and the Dane would curl up, indicating the-blow
landed near a vulnerable spot. - Instead of following up this advantage,- Britt/ switched his blows
from body to head and wore himself out. .-
Britt seemed to hit harder than at aoy previous time 'in his career, throwing, the full weight
of his body with hi*s blows. He caught Nelson a clean right cross to thejaw near the end'of the/third
round, which Britt's adherents thought would end the; fight Nelson wentdowii as tHough shot. He
was up in an instant, and as the gong sounded- "corners" he turned . anid [laughed /at .Britt. His .'nose
was bleeding badly aÂ£ the, time, and Britt kept peppering it throughout. There was a /continuous
stream of blood coming from it until the end of the fight -

Either might have won in the fifth round, " as they, stood ',< and [slugged dneianother at close

Early in the fight Britt's friends saw his hardest blows^ had no "stopping"; power in them, and
as they, saw him wasting his energy in slugging they feared . for ; the outcome. ; Nelson never /gave
way an inch, paying.no heed to the; shower of blows which .-were rained upon hisihead andsjaw.'-TTie

had a n-st. hut it would probably have
done him so grood.
The ring was not the regulation 24-foot
afTair required by the Queensberry rules,
ft proved unusually small for a runaway
fig-ht when Britt tried to evade the steady
rushes of the Dane.
Th<? fisrht attracted a crowd which filled
every part of the huge amphitheatre.
The t-pectatbrs were drawn from all
\u25a0walkF in life â merchant princes, doctors,
bankers, clerks and mechanics Jostling
and pressing; about^the ring. The spec
tators were orderly and good-natured and
were willing to put up with any incon
venience.
The Fituation was tense and strained for
The three-quarters of an hour which In
tervened between the appearance of Brltt
5n the ring and the coming of Kelson.
Both had been so stubborn over the
selection of t the referee that doubts were
expre?sed as to whether there would be a
fight. When it was definitely known the
rrten h&4 agreed upon Graney as referee
the spectators settled back to enjoy, the
epectacle.
KHITT ENTERS THE lUXG.
Britt entered the ring at eight mln
t;tes 10 2 o'clock. He was clad In a
red sweater, gray suit and gray over
coat. As "the pride of California" took
his seat in the sauthwest corner of the
arena, the crowd gave a lusty cheer.
Britt was accompanied by "Spider"
Kelly, his' chief second: Tiv Kreling,
Curtis Richardson, \u25a0 Frank Rafael,
Sammy Berger and Manager "Willus"
Brltt. The crowd took no notice of
the usual tin bucket and water bottles,
but when one of the many trainers
carried in a mother's clothes boiler
spectators wondered. Every one at the
ringside had a theory as to what It
contained, but the theory advanced by
a v:ag near to the r_-pes was accepted
as the best solution.
'"^Vhy," he announced, "that's J. Ed

DANE ADMIRES BRITT'S GRIT.
**T GUESS they will not tell you any more that Britt is
J[ the cleverest and hardest hitting lightweight in the
business. I think I showed the people I can beat him at his.
own game. I told all my friends I could beat him, and I did
it. I will say he is a great fighter, and as game a boy as
ever donned a glove. He fought me every inch of the way,
and I was puzzled for a while by the way in which he came
back. 1 can't describe just how I knocked him out. I saw
my chance, and waded in with rights and lefts. lam not sure â¢
which did the trick, but I got him, and that is all there is to
it. I will admit he hit me often, hut none of those blows had
any steam' behind them and they did not hurt me. I thought
J had him in the sixth round, and again in the thirteenth
round ; but he was so game and so strong that I could not
quite put him away. Jimmy has promised me we shall be.
good friends now, and I am glad of that. lam sorry my.
friends could not cash on me on account of the bets being
declared off; but Eddie Graney knows what is right, and 1
was a forty-five round contest and
Jimmy will need refreshments?'
"Kid"' Makowski, a one-armed youth,
Â« was in Jimmy's corner as "mascot," but
in the light of what happened he was
not playing true to form.
While awaiting the coming of the
battling one Britt's seconds encased his
hands in adhesive plaster to strengthen
them and to bold the bones in place.
The crowd impatiently looked for the
coming of the Dane, and to while away
the time "Willus" BrJtt, the "boy man
agrer," entered into an explanation.
"He says he won't take Jeflt." "Wil
lus" announced. "We won Mr. Jeffries

The crowd amused itself dnring the

were cries for Nelson and every min

sat close to the ring-side, and as the
his fallow wended his way to the roped
arena he was heartily cheered. Jeff
removed his straw hat and Eritfs sec
onds showed their approval of the
champion by clapping: theli\ hands.
Britt left his corner and grasped
Jeffries by the hand and this brought
'ortli more cheering.

"Gentlemen, Mr. Nelson refuses to

When the. crowd heard the announce

somewhat restored Jordan raised hia
voice again and said:
"Mr. Britt will not stand for any
body but James Jeffries."
There was more cheering, and when
Jordan could be heard he grasped Jef
fries by the arm and introduced him as
follows:
"Gentlemen: The only . undefeated
champion of the world,, who has retired

The crowd stood up and cheered Jeff,

There was more applause and then
the spectators became interested ,In a
fight on the side. The combatants were
invited to enter the ring ; and "settle
their differences, but declined to do so
as there was no money/in Sight..

PICTURES OF FIGHT S
PEOYE BIG SUCCESS
Fog Clears Away as Bout
Progresses, Dispelling
Light Question.
The moving pictures of the battle
are said to be a great success, though
only a few copies of the films, were giv
en out last night. Two machines were
in operation when the; fighters entered
the ring, and ; from that time till the
final punch was landed the cameras
were going all the time, catching every
incident in connection .with -the battle.
During the first two rounds the light
was not the best and therefore the pic
tures taken at that time were of only
ordinary merit. But the "sun com
menced :to \u25a0 shine as ,the battle waxed
hot and' the pictures Improved as the
minutes rolled by. , Miles brothers, the
operators. of the big. machine, say the
pictures will surely be the hit of the
century, in the fight line and promise
big 1 results. : â¢\u25a0
-It is expected the photographs will
be: on exhibition by- the: first; of. the
month, though It Is barely possible
they .will ; not be ready quite so - soon.
Manager. Jim Coffroth of the club has
bought ; the exclusive', rights to show
them all over the; world and If they
are a success he will make a small
fortune out of them.

half of Battling Nelson, sold his rights

.. Had Billy Nolan not objected to James
Jeffries serving aa referee the receipts
I -would have far exceeded the figures given
out last evening. According to the box of
flee figures 545.3U was taken in. The first
day the sale of seats opened the advance^
waa J13.0C0. The second day brought in,'
$10,000. Nolan then became suspicious of
Jeffries and his statements in the papers
brought the advance down to a few thou
sands. Many stayed away from thÂ« fight,
fearing it would not take "place.
. Although Manager Coffroth made
money he did not make as much as ha
had expected. He had hoped that Brltt
and Nelson would draw a 170.000 house,
but he was disappointed. However, there
may be balm for his feelings if the mov
ing pictures are a success, as he owns the
lion's share in the films.
Coffroth will turn over 53000 to Nelson
'for his share, if the pictures are a suc
cess.
The Tosemite Club gave the fighters 63
PÂ«r cent of the gross receipts. It Is un
derstood, however,' that Â« Jimmy Brltt -was
givon'a side Bonus to make the match.
According to the figures given ont by the
club,' Nelson's 'share is $13,84139.- Britfs
share will be $12,560.82. plus the side per
centage given him by the Yosemlte Club
and an Interest in the moving pictures.
If Manager Coffroth turns over $3000 ad
ditional to Nelson for his Interest in the
pictures/the "Battling" one will have a
bank roll amounting to ' Â£3.841.29. Of this
sum his manager. Billy* Nolan, receives
25 per cent. ' Nolan's share of the gate re
ceipts will therefore amount to $3950.?2.
This will amply - repay Nolan for the
weight he lost worrying over Nelson and
the referee dispute. -
The boxers will be calWd upon to pay
E. Mervin Graney, referee. 1500 apiece.
This was the price fixed by Jeffries and
as Graney is a high-priced man he irU>
ask the same ram. \|l
$8000. This was Â» very low pries If
the photographs turn out well, but No
lan said he did not want to be both
ered with them, as he had a whole lot
of work for the Dane already cut out.
Jimmy Britt still retains his Interest
in the pictures and he will probably
reap a small-sized harvest from them
when they are put on exhibition. It
everything goes right Jimmy will maks
more money out of the pictures than
he did out of the fight.
Coffroth plans to sell his copyrights
In the various States throughout ths
country and also In Europe and Can
ada. The pictures will be much more
valuable because the fight was a short
one. for none . of the dull features will
have to be cut. but and the whole ar
ray of films can handily be thrown oa
the canvas without wearying the on
lookers.
. Just before thÂ« battle Coffroth and
Nolan haa a .tilt over, their arrange
ment. Coffroth would not guarantee
Nolan his money unless the pictures
were good. , At that time the light was
bad and the fogr commenced to roll in,
but when the weather brightened up
the bargain was completed.

ascribe his first actual beaUng to the
cvtrconfidence wlrh which a previous tri
umph over the same opponent had ln
*-pjred him. It led him to the indiscretion
cf relinquishing tactics which had won

The Dane. Perhaps he desired to rebuke

iv the first contest, and show them that
he was not afraid to "mix It" with the

victory would have improved apace with
the rounds.
â¢ â¢ â¢
As for Nelson, his neatness as a fight-
Ing machine is unassailable. He, too,
fought like a gentleman, and Ilk* a gen
tleman he wears his honors. The Quanti
ty of punishment he assimilated In order
:o administer one of his stinging up-Jabs
pronounced him a physical marvel. He
:nvited Britt's punches and swings as if
he relished them, and seemed to feel well
rewarded if he landed one blow In return
for a dozen. Paradoxical as it may sound,
he was strongest when most distressed, i
As witness him stagger to his corner at
the finish cf the fifteenth round and a few
eeccntfs later, as he sat apparently col
lapsed, pluck a towel from the hands of
one of his 6econds and calmly wipe his
face with it That little action told the
whole story of the lad's marvelous recu
perative force.
Local flstiana does not record a more
unique event. There have been prize
fights that Involved as much money and
individual glory, but none of them took
place al f reeco. In daylight and within a
short ride from the .city's center. Jfor

crowd. It would be cafe to . wager that
every calling except that of the ministry
was represented within the corral at
Colma.
. But the mooted leveling of class dis
tinction was not apparent. It is tradition
that caste crumbles as it approaches a
prize ring and that In the tumult and the
shouting democracy comes to its own.
Nothing of the kind was visible at the
Eritt-Nelson show. The banker did not
jog flbows with his barber, nor did the
merchant drink from his messenger boy's
j-ocket Sask. Perhaps the prices of ad
mittance to the select sections were pro
hibitive of such socialism. Classes were
segregated in accordance with their abili-
Ay to swell the gate receipts. Presidio
Jieights did not^hrong the bleachers, nor
did the region south of the slit contribute
to the crowding of the 120-a-seat com
partments. In the production of vocal
noise only was social equality apparent.
In that respect the men of ducats broke
even with the horny-flsted.

"Stop buttin'. Nelson:"
'"Stop holdin', Brltt!"
"Move around, Graney!"
"Hats off!"
"Down in front!"
"Good" boy. Jlmmle!"
"Oh, you, Bat!"
Those were the most frequently heard
ebullitions of pent-up excitement. -But
there were many others. Almost every
person outside the roped quadrangle
Fhouted suggestions to his favorite box

self was constantly showered with fer

fighters nor referee paid the least atten

the slightest effect In quelling the clamor.

of Grit aria r Glevei 'ness.
The following is the story of the
fight by rounds:
souxrr-r.
The men came up and sparred care
fully for a few seconds. Nelson was
the first to lead, sending a light left to
Britt's head. Jimmy sent two straight
lefts to Nelson's nose, which left a red
mark; a right to the ribs and a left
hook to the stomach. Nelson forced
the pace, but was shaken up by a hard
right cross. Brltt got a left on the
nose that broke the skin, but put two
hard lefts to the body. Brltt drew
back from a left hook and stepped In,
delivering a hard left to the face and
a right to the ribs."' Nelson's nose was
bleeding slightly from a left, but the
Battler got in a left hook that jarred
Jimmy slightly.
ROUND 2. â¢ â¢.. V
Britt sent in two lefts to the face
after much fiddling. Both were very
cautious. Graney made the men break
without any stalling whenever they
came together. Britt's nose bled from
the abrasion. Brltt staggered Nelson
with a. left and rained blows with both
right and left to the Jaw, sending the
Battler back. Nelson came back
strong, however, sending Brltt back
with lefts to the face. Brltt then de
voted his attention to the body, send
ing in terrific rights over the hear with
an occasional j stralgnt left to the face.
Nelson attempted to fight In the
clinches, but Brltt blocked his at
tempts and â¢ Graney forced them to
break. At the ' grong Britt sent in a
hard left to the stomach. This was
Britt's round by a good margin.

Commuters Take a Brace at

Over the Orange Pickers
There wa* a fairly trood crowd at
Recreation Park yesterday, despite the
fact that the attraction t>f attractions
was on. The Commuters started badly,
but when the news came from the
arena they took a brace.
"If the Scandinavian can win a bat
tle, there' 6 a chance for us," remarked
Bill Devereaux. So the Oaks grot busy
in the sixth and the I>oo Loos, para
lyzed over the fall of the pride of Cali
fornia, went to pieces. It was 2 to .1
until the news from Colma was whis
pered around. " . a
Flood started for Morley's collection
in the first with a pretty wallop. To
man sacrificed and Smith lined one into
the left grass patch, landing Flood. A
smash by Brasbear, which the Old Red
Dog failed to retrieve, brought In
Smith.
The Oaks tapped the bell once in
the second, but It looked like a hope
less case until the sixth. By that time
the finish of the fiat-builder had been
announced and the crowd was saying
"1 told you so."
Hall went up in the air 'then and
Kruger found htm for a nice swat. He
booted an easy chance from Kelly and
the Loo Loos Â«eemed to get paresis
unanimously. When the debris was
cleared away the Oaks had annexed
three and the Angels had a severe
headache. Hall was good until the
Colma tragedy preyed upon hlÂ« mind.
Schmidt kept the wallops separated the
first hrning and on the whole twirled a
good game. Following Is the score:

good work behind him saved liim from
a worse beating. Bennett led the batting
gait with four hits out of five times up.
and they were all hard line drives. Rusb
Hall's two hits were most timely, and
Julie Strelb broke the hoodoo by getting.
a hit in a pinch. The folding of Russ
Hall, I Kane and Casey was high class.
Nordyke did not get his mitt on a couple

There is a familiar saj'ing, and a true one, that "Time proves all \u25a0*Â£{) YEARS\
things." When a medicine has stood this test for a period of forty j /Â» y^ >\u25a0_ I j
years, and is then more in popular favor than ever, there is no doubt \J CUJcES T |
as to its merits. This is the standard by which S.S.S.. has been â¢/SST'l^o^ â¢
measured, Wd its record of forty years of cures fully justifies its pop- i^SSr^s
ularity as a blood medicine. For nearly Imlf a century this great
remedy has been used in* the treatment of blood and skin diseases of every character, and so-
satisfactory have been the results that it is now the best known and most widely; used blood;
medicine in the world. The success of S. S. S. is based upon the fact that it has always
done everything claimed for it; it has maintained the confidence of the people because it de-i
served it The constantly increasing, demand for S. S. S. is the result of .the good words 1
spoken of it by those who have been cured of disease by its use, and,- therefore, know from
experience that it is l the greatest of all blood purifiers. : TTS FORTY YEARS OF EXIST-

Ever Given in the State
i One of the largest trap shooting tourna

opened yesterday by the Empire Gun
Club at Its Alameda Point grounds and
will end to-day. Eleven thousand blue
rock targets were whirled from three rap
id-fire automatic magazine traps for the
shooters and seventy gunmen fractured
the flying, disks. Owing to the counter
attractions at Colma and Sacramento
many clay smashers were lured away
from their favorite sport, but these will
be on hand to-day and it is expected that
nearly 100 marksmen will test their skill
and try for prises. In addition to the reg
ular programme of three merchandise and
three sweep shoots to-day there will be a
100-blrd race for the Phil Bekeart chal
lenge cup and a five-man interclub shoot
between teams from the San Francisco
Gun Club and the Santa Rosa Gun Club.
One o* the features of the shooting yes
terday was the appearance at the traps of
Mrs. J. C. Phelan. She used a strange
gun. but despite this handicap, beat many
of her masculine opponents. There were

she would "lower hers lid!" Caustically

she *unskewered and removed her . hat

almost as high- as: had \ its recent .cover.
Then, noting " his dismayed countenance,
she mischievous^ inquired: '.

THEONaGrKEETSTHE
VICTOR AFTER FIGHT
Battl ing Dane Takes His
Honors With Much
Modesty.
As Battling : Nelson ; fought : and ' strug
gled to get; through -the t vast crowd that
awaited him at the ringside after the
fight; he; paused now and then ~ to receive
the \u25a0 greetings of his friends and 'â¢ shake
hands with some of ; the more j privileged
ones. -It was a hard task for him and
his retinue 'of seconds to 'fight = their way \u25a0
outside, the; pavilion, ;,:- but "they- finally,
landed there' and raced, to ; Billy ' Nolan's
cottage, half a mile down the road. -
Here another vast.'crowd; awaited the
coming of the champion.-. â¢He I was ' hailed
like a victorious gladiator;of the : olden
times. Every one ; was cheering and ask
ing for a speech. ,. Men, women and ; chil
dren shouted and yelled" V and' - camera
fiends galore surrounded \ the! house, all
anxious to take a snapshot ;cf L the' man
who lowered the colors of Jimmy. Britt.";
; As soon at the Battler\ arrived at the
cottage he went Immediately. to| his
dressing-room, .where he -took a shower
bath and was xubbed down. He was
bright and cheery, and did not look; like a
man who \ had .just gone through 'eighteen
rounds of terrific 'milling. ' He ; finished
dressing, in a .twinkling; and; then calmly
sat down to greet "his }\u25a0 friends , and . ad
mirers as they flocked into the room \u25a0to
extend congratulations. "..'.. â¢\u25a0
The first- one to greet . trie .victorious
gladiator was his father, the | humble' lit
the Hegeswich carpenter. Nelson Sr., like
his son, seldom changes the expression
on his countenance, and when he-came to
talk to Bat he was his usual calm, pos
sessed self, with just the faintest sugges
tion of a loving smile overspreading his
face. ..\u25a0.-,.â¢
"Well, my boy, I : knew you would ."do
it," said the old gentleman as he sat down
alongside his son. "You had him all the
time and I -knew it. I was sitting just; a
few feet away and I saw the knockout"
"Well, daddy, I am glad you were here
to see me win," responded Nelson, ."I told
you I would beat Britt and I have kept
my promise. He had no chance ; against
me, t daddy. Mother will be waiting \ for
this news, and when she hears it I know
just how she will feel. It's i all * over now
and we are all satisfied and happy." ;
Nelson Sr. talked to the crowd and
looked more contented each minute. The
house was soon invaded by a; small army
ot admirers, and the Dane was anxiou/
to get; away, as the situation was too
strenuous. He ' wanted "to get ; down* to
take a hammam bath, but his'; manager
wanted him to wait till the crowd thinned
out.
The Dane's face was a bit damaged by
the awful wallops which Britt sent in, but
outside of these few scratches he . was
well and sound and not a bit. tired or
worn- looking. , He did not \ seem very
much elated over his great victory, but
took it much as a matter.of course. . He
had ' apparently been sure of winning the
fight, and when victory came his: way .he
accepted it without any undue demon
stration.
"Nelson said after the battle that he. in
tended to take a good rest and' ahow his
father around tha country. "I really .have
no .'definite plans as yet," said the great
Dane,\"l guess I will accept a few the
atrical engagements , in the East; and , if
there iei. any chance to take on a : few
good men,* why, I am. there, though I am.
not going to break my neck- trying to get
matches. :, I am the ; real; champion now,
and they, will have to come to me in: the
future, and don't you forget it" ;,
The Dane spent -the earlier part of the
night in the hamrnan' bath, after -which
he went to a hotel to sleep the- sleep ot
the just and fight the great battle over
and over again i^his dreams.

Miss Violet Sutton
and Mrs. Bruce
C -\u25a0
Win Doubles.
.-Before the largest crowd ever gathered
at the Hotel Rafael tennis courts the an
nual coast championship tennis tourna
ments came to a close yesterday. Miss
May Sutton, the cleverest woman â¢ player
in the .world, made her first appearance
since her "successful tour of i tha United
States and England, and despite numer
ous counter-attractions about 1000 peopla
crossed the bay to see the wonderful lit
tle player in action. Needless to say. shÂ»
successfully defended her title of coast
championâ in fact,' she - completely \u25a0 out
classed her sister. Miss Florence, ' allow
ing her but one game In two sets.
; To the surprise of "a majority of tha
spectators, George Janes of the Califor
nia Tennis Club defeated Fred Adams of
the Golden Gate Tennis Club in the finals
of the men's singles. Many thought the
State champion would win easily, but
Janes proved too much for him. In tha
absence of J. D. MacGavin the champion
sUlp went to Janes, the tournament win
ner, by default.
As was expected, the morning macth
between Miss Violet Sutton and Mrs.
Bruce and Miss Ida Mearns and Misa
Vera" Crocker was won easily by. tha
former. TTIe local girls did' their best,
but they were outclassed and did well to
win two games. The score was 6-0, 6-2.
Miss May Sutton. despite blistered fee:
and travel tire, played a more wonderful
game than ever, and her clever sister had
all she could do to win one game in two
sets. Miss Florence played her usual
steady game, but May had speed, accu
racy and direction. Her backhand has
Improved and her forehand drive, which,
Is her main reliance, was speedier than
ever. Many of the games were close and
the match was interesting from start to
finish. The score was 6-1, 6-0 l ~-,'.'.
The match between Adams and Janes
was the . poorest championship contest
ever played at San Rafael. At times
there was some good tennis, but almost
invariably each contestant scored on bis
opponent's errors. The best thins about
the matter was tls closeness, the windu?
being unusually exciting. It went the full
five sets, the score, in Janes' favor, being
6-0. 4-6, 5-7. 6-2, 8-4.
Adams was probably suffering from,
stage . fright at the outset and played a
miserable game for more than a set.
Janes, on the other hand, was cool and
played his best game. He took the firstl
nine games, Adams being unable to break
in until the tenth game. Adams soon ran
the score up to 5-4. and pulled out tha
tenth game from an 0-40 lead.
Adams* was always a trifle In the lead
in Ihe third set. and after many deuca
games won^it. 7-5.\ ~At this stasa'of tha
match Adams looked all over a winner.
Janes had an abundance of nerve yester
day and did not quit when he lost tha
lead. â¢ He played harder than ever In tha
fourth set and won It easily. Tha score
was 6-2. .
In the fifth and deciding set each player
iron on service until 2-3. when Janes
broke in on Adams' service game, but
lost his. own. Janes again won on Adams"
service and also won his own, giving
him a lead of : 5-3. In the ninth gama
Janes had a lead of 40-15, but after going
to deuce four times Adams finally won it.
Janes did some terrific serving in, the last
game -and took it without losing a point.
Janes undoubtedly owes his victory to
the fact that he broke up Adams* fast
driving game. Janes realized from tha
start that Adams possessed a weak
backhand, and he played to It on almost
every occasion. Jane 3 chopped the balls
low and swift to Adams' deep backhand
court, and followed Into the net fast.
Thi3 style of play undoubtedly won the
day for Janes. The latter played his best
game, while Adams at times was as wild
as a March hare. Just whether Janes*
style of play was responsible for Adams*
poor form or not is a question that will
be argued for some time. The fact re
mains that Janes won out and will hold
the championship for the coming year.
The match was without the class ot
championship matches in' past years.
Miss May Sutton said yesterday that
she .will -not 'play in this city. She has
had a long siege and is anxious to get
back home, as soon as possible.;
A ball and the distribution of prizes
last night wound up the week of sport.

fact that, although rubber^tlred cabs ap

lefts* to the' head and then staggered Britt
with \u25a0a : right. They stood head to heacj
and i slugged. Britt coming back and flsht-j
ing, desperately. when the bell rang.
Nelson seemed much the fresher In tht
fourteenth round. Britt's seconds helped
him out of his chair. Nelson, staggered
Britt with a straight left. Britt missed <*
right "and then caught Nelson a hard left
to the head. Brltt walked into a har4
right; "which did him no good. . Britl
seemed on the verge of collapse, but hÂ«
put in a desperate raUy at the bell and
was doing the more' effective work. Th*
fifteenth arid 'sixteenth rounds were no|
whirlwind affairs. Britt continued to land
on "Nelson's Jaw. but could not stop him,
The seventeenth .was another- slugging
round. Early; In the eighteenth roumt
Nelson missed 'a terriWe right swing and
then landed blows which brought him th*
long end of the purse.

BY A NOTED CITY E-D-I-T-O-R.
"FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD" I deliberately
and conscientiously TESTIFY that after 20
years* distressing LAMENESS and exhaust-
ing sufferings from RACKINO PAINS,
caused by RHEUMATISM, which numerous
physicians and all kinds of remedies had
utterly FAILED to ours. Rexradlo. by only
' FIVE SECONDS of his truly MARVELOUS
drugless treatment absolutely, COMPLETE-
LY. "PERMANENTLY" removed EVERY
SYMPTOM, root and branch. &ad tor a
WHOLE MONTH, to thisdate. I have- con-
tinued to feel like a NEW- MAN, without^"
the SLIGHTEST RETURN of any ot the ojd
SYMPTOMS. I was I-N-3-T-A-X-T-L-Y
(mark that word) able to STOOP to. thÂ»
floor. STAND straight. RAISE my limb to
a table and much higher, SIT and RISE
quickly, naturally, without the usual help
of my hands, and then I R-A-N fleetly and
J-U-M-P-E-D H-I-G-H from the floor MANY
times, without strain, stiffness or pain, ALL.
. these feats having for 20 years been abso-
lutely I-M-P-O-S-3-I-B-L-E. I am still as
LIMBER. ACTIVE and capable Â©f HARD
WORK as I was whan a healthy, strong
BOY. My* friends aro astounded aad cai.
hardly believe their own eyes. Since zay
I-N-S-T-A-N-T CURE I hava sent several
sick friends to Rexradlo and he has quickly
and wonderfully benefited all. HÂ«ra ar-Â»
. some of my FRIENDS, whose NAMES I
can give you : A friend, 28 years. TOTALLY
DEAF. Instantly heard a distant WHI3PER:
another of 25 years heard distant: whisper;
friend with LAME limb from BPINAL dis-
ease instantly had free use of limb; friend
aged 79. nearly powerless PARALYZED leg.
Instantly raised It a srreat height. RAN.
and ' LEAPED; an exactly similar â¢ caas ' in-
stantly RAN, LEAPED and DANCED:
friend's large ULCER quickly â¢ healed:
friend's PARALYZED arm Instant-
ly restored, grasped, lifted and swung
heavy furniture: friend with tama trouble
and same "instant" benefit r friend hav-
ing life-long agonizing STOMACH dis-
ease speedily cured. - I PERSONALLY
WITNESSED all these wonnderful re-
sults, and pledge my 40 years* reputation
In this ctty. They are all TRUE, Â«nd not
"exaggerated." OneÂ© I Imagined Rexradirt

EVOLVED BY PERRIER
31 >st cry of Its Presence In Del ngm
That Live bat a Short
Time.
. According to the theory that instinct is
inherited experience it is difficult to see
why insects that live only a few weeks
or months should have any Instincts at
all, since the time in which they may ac
cumulate experience Is so limited. But
Edmond Perrier, an advocate of this the
ory, shows us that we may reconcile it
with these facts by supposing that the
criminal experience, of which the Instinct
of insects is the successor by hereditary
transmission, was acquired by their an
cestors ages ago, when they li\*ed longer
and had time to learn. Of this ingenious
theory M. A. Latour says In La Nature:
"The progress made recently in the
BtuSy of the nervous system led Edmond
Perrier to a new theory of Instinct, re
garding which philosophers will probably
be somewhat skeptical, but of which a
geological consequence deserves to be
known for its ingenuity. The author is
endeavoring to explain, by means of ex
perience and heredity alone, how insects
whose adult life lasts only a few weeks
or even a few days, and who know noth
ing of their parentage, have the time and
the ability to acquire their wonderful in-
Evidently there Is no possibility
* here of education nor of customs; It
would seem as If the manifestation of
Instinct In the individual were quite spon
taneous. . *
"But il. Perrier notes that the existence
of the seasons, as we know them, ap
prars to be of very recent geological
origin. Geologists In general agree that
temperature and climate were once, for
very long periods, absolutely uniform In
all parts of the earth and throughout the
whole year. This 1Â» explained by the
fact that the sun was then much larger,
the inequalities of the. seasons having
been finally brought about, little by lit
tle, by Its gradual condensation. Now, In
sects existed at a time when this con
densation had not yet taken place. In
sects were remarkably abundant on the
banks of the carboniferous lakes or la
goons, and the Interesting discoveries
Of Messrs.-^Fayol and Charles Brong
niart at Commentry have shown how
great was their variety and how huge
their size at that time.
VICow, since there were then no sea
eonsâthe cause that now brings about
the early death of Insects, so soon after
their reproduction â these carboniferous
Insects must have lived as long as any
other creatures; they must have been
able, like our higher animals, to ac
quire experience and transmit it to
. their . offspring, thus gaining an ac
quired and cultivated intelligence in
the same measure aa other living be
ings. This was then transmitted by
heredity, and. when the seasons . began
to appear. In the. tertiary epoch, when
by . the . appearance -'of _ cold Insect life
was . reduced to a brief season, when
experience and parental education
. could, no longer, play their part, the in
telligence formerly, acquired and trans
mitted from generation to generation
must, according to M. Perrler's theory,
have been changed Into Immutable In
stinct; that Is to say. It mtist have been
fixed at a determinate point without
power to progress further. Our pres
ent insects . are thus reproducing In
definitely the faculties and cerebral de
velopment .of the insects of the sec
ondary epoch â¢ of geological time." â

THE LUMBER TRADE.
Condition of the Industry Reported
Exeellrnt.
Pacifle Coast Wood and Iron says:
The whole co&tt notices an Improvement In
the lumber trade, and evidences point \u25a0 toward
the continuance of the present betterment.
There are many lumber manufacturers i and
dealers who believe that . there will be even
greater advancement In their Interests and
there is cone reason for their contention. The.
general demand 'is adtive. with - offshore call*
Increasing, while Eastern orders are more plen^
tiful. The summer dullness is passing rapidly
away and, with the resumption of improve
ments by the agricultural communities, - local
coast business will positively expand until last
year's record will undoubtedly be surpassed.
- Building all over the Pacific Coast is most
lively, with hardly a city, cr town that does
not record the greatest activity. The local
retail lumber yards report \u25a0 that their orders
are of times far In excess of â¢ their normal
stocks, and imny of these yards are stocking
up as never before, as the current . pointing of
the trade weather vane indicates an approach- 1
ing fall and winter Increase of trade require
ments that will cot allow them to be back
ward: in their yard holdings. Architects ; and
all builders and contractors have all they can
stand, and the former are. In many instances,
Increasing their ofnee forces, In order to enable
tt> m to keep pace with their work. ' \u25a0 \u25a0-:
Redwood Is active beyond even the fondest
hopes, with prices strongly held and some
possibilities of a near-by advance. .The East
ern end coast orders are plentiful.' while off
shore business Is picking up. The mills are
many of them putting on their night crews,
while almost all of the larger plants are run

DETECTIVES ACT QUICK
London's Six Millions Under
Surveillance Soon After
a Crime Has Been Reported
Directly a \u25a0 big, \u25a0 mysterious crime oc
curs i in London, Scotland Yard throws
over the metropolis a' strong but lrivls-*
lble net, . from "which onjy, the ,very
lucky;or tha ..very .clever, criminal can
escape.; When ', you consider that the
London : over which ,- Scotland Yard has
power has <a r radius of " fifteen miles
from .' Charing,- Cross :you. will under
stand the wonderful nature of the po
lice organization, r Within -a -few hours
of the discovery of a sensational crime,
the; author of which has escaped, the
6,000,000 people", in. London are more or
les.s under, surveillance.' . â¢ â¢
Imagine ; a terrible . murder such as
that at Deptford a few days ago. .The
local police ' immediately . communicated
|with; Scotland Yard, giving the f acta â
stating, for; example, that three people
have ": been : murdered â¢in ', a. house and
that a fair-haired man; of 40; .wearing
a. long gray overcoat, had been seen to
leave \ the; house. \u25a0 From : Scotland Yard
there radiate , to , the twenty-one metro
politan police' divisions. . from "A" or
Whitehall district -to the "V". or High
gate-district,: such facts as the authori
ties in the great central building on, the
embankment .think it necessary should
be' known. ,
CHIEF DETECTIVE AT WORK.
, It ;ls \u25a0 then only a matter* of a few
hours "before ;: the policemen* in the
streets are keeping their eyes open for
a fair-haired man of 40; wear ing- a long
gray overcoat, v But this Is only the be
ginning of the' work. One of the chief
detectives of Scotland Yard jls ,on f the
scene of the" crime as quickly as it is
possible for him to get, there and'pos
eibly the assistant-commissioner.him
self rushes down on his motor car. The
chief s,: with " their assistant, make a
thorough examination of Uie place and
take photographs.
" Apleceof glass bearing the marks of
two. fingers is sent off : at once to Scot
land Yard. It has been decided, that
the . criminal is V a \u25a0 casual - laborer, " and
there? is ; a .detective ,- quietly watching
every .common lodging-house within" a
radius of miles.- Meanwhile one of the
senior detectives at the yard, with a
memory stored with the names of each
of the desperate habitual criminals who
might be likelyto commit such a crime,
has set * on ; foot a : search' for. each, of
these^ men, whose movement will,"'un
known to themselves, be traced ' for
days back. :'..',
That businesslike-looking commer
cial traveler who lounges round the
bookstall or near, the booking office Is
also : probably.- a 3 man -from "the yard.
,The methods vary.^ according 'to clrcum-'
stances, but in every direction there
are: the: strong, unseen meshes of the
police net..\-Up at: Scotland Yard the
finger prints x on : the piece' of glass are
being, carefully compared^ with ; some of
the \ finger i prints -of known criminals.
For - years finger '-\ prints ' have ', been'
stored and there arc- now on register
more, than 60.000 sets. :
Prisoners have had to Ink their fin
gers slightly ' all ; around on a pre
pared slab ;and then place .them on 'a
piece of ', specially /prepared paper, turn
ingjthem slowly roundbythe directjori
of -an official. until an impression' of all
the skin* markings' has been left on the
paper.' I ? Finally the sets of finger prints
are ]' indexed * and ; stored away until
wanted for comparison either with
finger; prints subsequently taken or
with , accidental . marks made by escap
ing criminals, such as those left on the
piece of : glass. ,
OFTEX FURXISH GOOD CLEW.
Perhaps - finger ; marks on .the
glass coincide with those of a criminal
who*: has â¢ not \ been : seen or; heard of ; f or
many months.- An ; independent search
is at once made for him and possibly
some of . his old acquaintances are en
listed In the quest. Hemayibave .been
af frequenter <of 'all kinds of low "dens.'
Be sure that.ln every one of those dens
there "is: an; official or : unofficial repre

ways strenuous Scotland Yard seta its
silent; machinery, in ' .motion ' for '.-.'the
cause of. Justice. The criminal who es
capes 'from i the = rlng-f ence^ may esteem
himself fortunate, j Day by . day * In ' any
particular case the ring is drawn tight-,
er.;arid .the criminal' is kept i within the
region . of -his "crime." ,

HEAVY DEATH ROLL
\u2666 FROM THE PLAGVB
Over a SXIUIon of People Died There
from 'In India . Durlo; - ,
gBBBBsir- Last -Year.
In - 1903 , the ; number of deaths \u25a0 from
plague in India was 353.000; In 1904 It
was over 1,000,000. being 1.040.000. Off
the 1,000,000 deaths more than 35,000^
occurred In one province, . and that
province was the Punjab, the one from
which some of the best Indian soldiers
are recruited. Consider the possible
significance of a fact like this upon tho .
ethciency of the Indian army. The Pun- â¢
j*b is not a large province, ita actual
population being about. 20.000.000 or
only- two-thirds that of England, and
yet the .deaths In the Punjab during
1904 from plague amounted , to- over
250,000 In the course of. twelve weeks
only.
WebelXjve that these figures, which
have been published before, .have never
been contradicted, . though â¢ they ' seem
incredible. What would be _thought.
said or done in.Kngland if In the sourso
of ;twelve .weeks.over 250,000 persona,
were swept off by one disease? Surely
there would be something like a panic
And if this destruction threatened ;to
be an annual one would not any. inac
tivity on the part of the authorities in
whom prevention, is vested be deeply
resented? ,T&e English public has. of
course,^ not r realized the . position, â¢ and.
though we> are not playing the alarmist
with any special relish for the office, wa
think that . the policy of concealmentâ
or the absence of policy that, has neces
sitated concealment â has gone on lon g
enough.
\u25a0 The small number, of deaths from
plague :In Hongkong and Mauritius la
regularly published every "week in tha
daily ' papers and presumably ' the in
formation comes from; official 3ources,
but the mortality which occurs In India
from the same danger not only to India
but to the world Is never publishedâ
it is not ; considered ', wholesome read
ing. The public Is not aware from 1 of
ficial -information of the 'terrible trag
edy going on In one" part of the em
pireâin - that part which is always
termed the brightest Jewel In the.pos

idea of inquiry is a sound one wÂ» hayÂ«
pointed out that we do not think thÂ«
measures to be undertaken really meet
the case. Three and a half millions of
people have died f rom' ; plague . In India
since 1898, and the proposal to send out

causes \u25a0of the .tragedy strikes us as , in

ARE BLOWN UP
Of the Thirty-Two 3len'Em
ployed at the Works Nine
teen Are Known to be Dead
3UXY OTHERS IXJUEED
Buildings Twenty Miles Off
Are Rocked and Damaged
by the Terrific Explosion
COXNELLSVILLE. Pa.. Sept 9.â The
Rand Powder Mills at Fairchance, six
miles south of Uniontown, were wiped
out by an explosion to-day. Of the
thirty-two men who went to work in
the mills nineteen are known to be dead.
Of these thirteen have been identified.
The list of dead and missing: follows:
Fred Waterstraw Jr.; - Mclntyre,
died at hospital; Albert Woods. O. M.
Humphries, George Llewellyn; Harry
Underwood, died at hospital; Elmer
Hughes, Clyde Woods, James Break
iron, George Martin, Charles Barclay,
Gilbert Mitchell, A. Gribble, Fred Wa
terstraw Sr., Charles Fritz, William
Llewellyn. Oscar Metcalf. Omer Swaney.
Frank Ryland.
Beside* nine of the factory force who
were seriously injured, scores of peo
ple in the town of Fairchance, within a
half-mile of the powder mills, were
more or ltss painfully mjured.
The shock of the explosion was dis
tinctly felt in Conncllsville, twenty
miles away, buildings being rocked on
their foundations. At Uniontown.hun
dreds of panes of glass were broken.
In the town of Fairchance there is
'scarcely a house that did not suffer
damage. Haystacks were toppled over
in the fields and livestock were stunned.
Tho rails of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad and the West Pennsylvania
Traction Company were rooted from the
roadbed and traffic was delayed six
hours.
Train No. 52 on the Baltimore and Ohio
had a narrow escape from destruction. It
hafi just passed the Rand mills when the
explosion occurred. The windows in the
coaches were shattered and passengers
thrown into a panic. A street car on the
West Pennsylvania Railway had also
passed a few seconds before the explosion
\u25a0ad was far enough away to escape dam
age, though it was derailed.
There were eeven explosions In all.
Evory one of the ten buildings was totally
demolished. The debris that was strewn
ever the ten acres of ground where the
was located took fire soon after the
txplosicn and added its terror to the dis
aster.
The first three explosions were not as
serious as the last four. Then the pack
house, pressing room and magazine blew
up, followed by two cars of dynamite.
Many of the survivors had thrilling ex
periences. Orrville Swaney was working
in the glazing room and ha~ gone out
for a drink of water, he was just out-^
side when the mixing mill went up. The
\u2666^plosion threw him high In the air, but
ne landed on his feet in a network of
fallen wires. Dodging these he sped
around the hill and was fifty feet away
when the second explosion threw him on
his face. He lay there stunned and Knew
nothing cf the terrific blast that came
when the storage magazine went up. A
half "hour after u.e explosion he was
picked up and carried to a. place of safety.
AJI day. at short intervals searchers would
bring m bits of bodies or clothing. A
majority of the dead men were single,
although several of them leave large
families.
\Yh*=n the bodies were recovered the
work of identification was very difficult.
The hole where the magazine exploded
it fifteen feet deep and fifteen yards
EQ'jare.
Conservative estimates place the loss
to the Rand Company at several hundred
thousand dollars. There are also exten
sive losses to private houses and buildings
in ail surrounding towns.
YOUNG WAXAMAKER
KEXTS A FIXE HOME
Secures a Famous Residence
on the Thames Not Far
Prom Windsor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Sept. 9.â On account of its
peculiar location,. Temple House, on the
Thames, not far from Windsor, which
Rodman Wa.namak.er na-s taken, is one
of the most desirable of all the delight
ful sumaitr homes now such a feature
on the' river. Instead of standing close
to the biink of the main stream, ex
posed to the view of constant river
traffic,, the house is hidden up a pic
turesque "backwater," which, branch
ing from the main channel, winds Â£or
a long distance between overhanging
willows.
Temple House, which is a large and
commodious building, became famous
come year* ago as the residence of the
late General Owen Williams. Screened
even from;explorers of the quiet back
water, by a heavily wooded island and
situated some distance from a main
toad, the house with its beautiful park
of more than 600 acres made such a de
lightful retreat for tired society folk
that invitations to spend a few days
on the estate became-greatly desired.
Some time before he came to the
thron.e King Edward formed a friend
ship with General Williams, which
laÂ«ed until the latter's death a few
year* ago, and Temple House has been
honored by several \trom the
present sovereigns. His Royal High
ness* first stay was marked by a pe
culiar preliminary. Determining that
every one of the royal visitor's early
impressions should delight him. Gen
eral Williams cut a new drive right
through a magnificent grove of ancient
trees to the comer where ."the Mario w
road joins the Henley road and built a
fine lodge there so that the Prince
might pass through the grounds all the
way to the house Instead of approach
ing it by the public road.
Substantially in its present condition
the estate passed down to General "Wil
liams' son at the father's death and it
is- from this son that Wanamaker has
succeeded in leasing it. Among the
ereat summer colony along the fiver
Iber are several places that eclipse
Temple House in grandeurâ notably WV
W. * Astor's Cliveden and" Shiplake
Courts near Henley, which belongs to
F?r XV. R. Clayton, but In Temple
House Wana.ma.ker has a residence
which for general advantages ranks
sernjid to none on the Thames.

when the prospect was much more serious
than to-day. The council heard what the
health authorities were doing and con
firmed the wisdom of the measures. Tho
most hopeful feature of the situation,
a semi-official summary of the pro
ceedings says, is that the- puWlc can
be entrusted with carrying out" the
precautionary regulations. Through this
disposition on the part of the peo
ple both the danger of an epidem
ic and exaggerated fears are overcome.
The danger of an epidemic is not to be
referred to because the possibility of such
a misfortune does not exist. The most
confident feeling prevails that the disease
is now nrraly in the grasp of the sani
tary authorities and that they are ' co
operating with the private health service.
HAMBURG, Sept. 9.â Dr. McLaughiin
of the â¢ United States ' Marine Hospital
Service jsays that the preventive agencies
here "have the cholera by the throat," to
use his expression, and that there is
scarcely one chance in a thousand of an
epidemic. Three days - have now passed ,
without another case, and if Monday
passes without one it may be assumed
that the cholera here has ceased to be i
sporadic. - \u25a0
BROMBERG. Prussia, Sept. 9.â Six hew
cases of cholera and one death were re
ported to-day in the .five villages of this
administrative district. . :Â»
PUBLIC STILL DOTES
OX "MARY ANDERSON
Birth of a r Baby Girl Brings
Her Congratulations From
All Sections.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. 9.â That Mary Ander
son, as an affectionate public still calls
Madame Antonio de Navarro, has lost
little of her popularity since her retire
ment from the stage years ago has been
shown by .the hearty congratulations that
have been showered upon her from all
quarters on. the birth of a daughter re
cently. She still retains most of the good
looks which long procured for her pict
ures a bigger sale than those of any oth
er actress. She leads the life that most
conduces. to the preservation of youthful
charms. In the old-world village of
Broaaway,. Worcestershire, .she has _a.de
lightful home in the midst of a colony of
literary and artistic celebrities, and there
she spends most of her time. If she cared
for that sort of thing her social triumphs
might be as conspicuous as those she
"achieved on the stage. But the gay world
of fashion, for which less favored women
make bankrupts of themselves, physically
and pecuniarily, has no attractions for
her. v .
It is now more than fifteen years since
she retired from the stage, and "in spite
of all temptations" she has remained true
to her resolution not to return to it again.
What the resolution has cost her In cold
cash represents a sum bo enormous that
it would challenge credibility. After she
had been off the stage for several years
she was offered a salary of j $10,000 a week
for a thirty weeks' season in America,
but she declined it. There is little doubt
that if she should choose to act again
any time within the next ten years she
could pick up ' a fortune within a few
months, for, fickle where most of its fa
.vorites are concerned? the public has al
ways been true to Mary Anderson. But
it is net likely she will ever do it.
Though she cannot be induced to" use her
gifts to make money for herselfâ of which
* Tie has all she needsâ she has' no such
scruples where the cause of charity is
concerned. True, she never acts or re
cites. now, but since her retirement she
has studied' singing, for. she discovered
herself to be the possessor of a magnifi
cent contralto voice many' years ago.
This grift she uses freely, not- only for
the delight of her friends, but to assist
those who' are in need.
ROCKEFELLER TELLS
OF CHURCH'S NEED
Advocates Business Basis for
the Teaching of tlie
. Gospel.;
CLEVEI^AND, Sept. 9. â John D.
Rockefeller last night at the prayer
meeting in/ the Euclid-avenue Baptist
church ad\-ocated a business basis for
the teaching of the gospel. " Rev. . Dr.
Eaton had asked that, the Ideas of 'his
audience 'on the great need of .the
church be given. Two men replied.'
One was Rockefeller. The. other was,
from his dress, a laborer.
The laborer was 'given "'the floor, "the
multi-millionaire sitting; down with a
smile. Rockefeller's chance came lat
er, when he said:
"I believe what the church needs
most is concentrated common sense
common sense In business and business
sense In spiritual matters. If we as
individuals don't attend to ' the tern-^
peralside of the church the spiritual
side is bound to fall. We can't' hope
for^a sustained revival of religion,'
,", "I believe that. it i 3 our duty ; to pray
and* work, and I believe it is pur duty
to'givp ia support of the churches.
Th's' is. the secret of our success in
business. Why should not it be the
secret of. our success here?"

BOTH LITTLE MEN^HI
.-\u25a0'. WEIGH-IN SAtfELT
Mr Tumbles Violently
Wlien Ex-Champioii Steps;
the Scales.: .:'â¢â¢; .
When Jimmy Britt and Battling: Kelson
weighed 'in yesterday morning at Harry
Corbett's". the premier California-.light
weight'was a bit heavier than the hus'.ty
Dane and barely made : the weight. The
bar -"came near trembling when trie
plumber boy mounted the scalea. j There
was an Instant's pause and It settlÂ«d
down, ''lndicating- that 'everything was all
right. tigggiaeSgssssEsy *. .
\u25a0; Nelson was - the . first >to - arrive" on- the
scene and "when 19 o'clock rolled around
and the Britts failed to show. Manager
Billy. Nolan became uneasy and told BÂ«t
to undress and pile on the scales. The
Dane was about to obey when some of
his; friends', suggested it would " be better
to wait . a minute so ' there would be no
danger of taklns cold. - ' \u25a0, ;
When 10:07 arrived.. Nolan told Nelson"
to go ahead and undress. In a twinkling
the Dane climbed on the scales. All eyes
were- turned on him and a sigh of relief
was breathed alt along the line as Bat
stood on th?" scales and failed to maKe
the bar move the, hundredth part of an
inch. "
Harry Corbett balanced the scales, pat
on his glasses and. nodded his head as as
sent when he >saw JTelson had made, the
weight without any trouble.
There was another wait. a-Â« 1 stQl no
Britts. .The bij* crowd 'bÂ«san to grow Im
patient and some one susgrested that there
would bean awful- row when the plumber
boy and his retinue should arrive, fbr
th<-y all thought the Britts would â¢ insist
that Bat climb, on the scales again.
At 10:12 there was a racket at the door
and the police shouted to the crowd to
stand _asidÂ«. . A few secondÂ» later a bi;
auto dashed up to the place bÂ«arlns
James Edward and his seconds. They
jumped out of . the machine and fougrht
their; way Into the place.' Jimmy was at
tired in a red sweater and cap ' and a
cravenette coat and wore a pleasant ex
pression on his face.
"I. am very, sorry to have kept you
waiting-." said Jimmy as he pushed his
way through the crowd to where Nelson
sat near the scales. "Have, you weighed
yet?" asked the California^, and whÂ«n
Nelson 1 nodded' affirmatively. Britt com
menced to peel off his clothes without go
ins: through the formality of ~ shaking
hands. â¢ , . \u25a0-â¢ \u25a0 â¢ . .
In a trice Jlmray was * on the scales.
He. wore a serious look for an instant
when it looked as though he would go
bver the weight. AH eye 3 were turned on
the indicator as it poised and barely trem
bled. A few seconds of: anxiety arid it
was all over, for the plumber boy barely
managed to pas 3 the trying orde-i to the
satisfaction of Stakeholder Harry Cortxtt
and the entire assemblage. . |
During the whole performance. Britt Sr.
and Nelson Sr. stood at opposite sides of
the scales casting admiring 1 glances at
their offspring. Britt had a fat cigar in
his mouth and looked like a true sport.
Nelson had. his hands in his poet ets and
was a -striking contrast to the ;bustUns
man opposite him. He seemed wrappÂ»diuj>
in - thought and ;did not appear to realize
what. it- all meant.
When: the weighing in was over. Britt
again jumped info hls'bfg~auto and was
whirled to his home on Bryant stret-t.
Nelson and hia followers left the place for
a nearby hotel, where the Dane rested till
thr hour of the -battle.
BRITT IS FAVORITE r
> UP TO LAST FOMENT
Kelson Backers Suffer When
. Graiiey Calls Early .
Bets Off.
Eddie^Graney's decision in calling * off~
all bets made previous to the time he was
chosen referee of the great fight did not
do- a great amount of harm for the rea
son that the wagering up to that time, did
â not run very high. 'When tire decision 'on
referee was 'made the' wagerers '.at* once
began to make a new book and the bet
jting started in with Britt a favorite at i*
to 7 and 10 to S l i.
In some circles around the rin* a. few
big bets were made, but for the most part
the * wagers ' were . small ones. Pool boys
were busy running hither and thither
through the crowd, offering money on
both ends. At the entrance to the big pa
vilion several pool boxes were In opera
tion, but these did little or no business,
for when, the fight started naturally
everybody flocked inside and did. the best
tw ccuud>4Â« getting bets down at -\u25a0 the
ringside.
Many.*, of Nelstm^g admirers were very
sore after the fight. A few Eastern men
had big wagers on. him. There was many
a. lucky Britt man who was blessing his
stars that Graney. did fender "such a de
cision at the eleventh hour. " -â¢
John Curley. a well-known Chicago sp^rt
and one of- Nelson's mest intimate friends,
bet several hundred dollars on the Dace
at odds of 10 to 7 and 10 to $Â£. When
Graney said the wafers did not yo Curley
was a sore man. He had confidence In the
ability of. the Dane to- beat Britt and
risked all ho could lay hands on. To make
natters worse Curley did not have any
money with him when he came to the
pavilion and as it warn too late -to send
after it then he simply had to be content
and stand his loss.
William McClatchy. another strong Nel
son man. was the victim of the same un
fortunate circumstances. He came >all
the way -from Chicago to get a good slaeil
bet down on Nelson and took a lot of
the ! short end money. Like " Curley._ he
came out to the pavilion with only a lit
tle bit of change and was tearing his hair
around the ringside as Nelson was busily
giving Britt a beating.
Both McClatchy and Curley would have
brought a lot of money with them to tho
ringside, but friends advised them 'tw
leave it at their " hotels, saying that the
place would be ' full of pickpockets . who
would not 'overlook a single ,. chance to
rob a person who might be , suspected of
having a bit of change'ln his clothes. *
A number . of well known "sporting 'men
around town were at the ringside ready
to make big bets. But most of these did
not succeed in their efforts to get; their
coin down, for all the Nelson takers " at
the ringside .were mostly of the piking or
dtr. and. a few .dollars proved their limit.-
Even money^thaf Britt would^ win with-
In thirty: rounds was liberally laid In .the
poolrooms along the line" and in the pool
boxes at the. pavilion. These wagers were^
also canceled by, Graney's 'rullhj and be-*
cause of lack of tfrne ' there was no new
book made on the rounds when the men
entered the ring.
