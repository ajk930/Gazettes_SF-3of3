Throughout the day, when Northern
Securities shares were booming on the
curb and its affiliated stocks and the
Pacilics. chiefly Union Pacific, were ad
vancing by leaps and bounds, on the"
Stock Exchange, the air was full of
rumors, some of them of an alarming
character.
Dealings in Union Pacific common
aggregated over 40 per cent of the
total outstanding issue. It was de
clared in various quarters that the
Hill-Morgan party had for some reason
deemed it necessary to buy heavily in
this stock.
The belief in this rumor was height
ened by the fact that brokers who often
represent Morgan interests in this ex
change were heavy buyers of Union
Pacific all the way up.
Large amounts of Southern Pacific
shares also changed hands, and sales
of Great Northern preferred, of which
the floating 1 supply is very small,
amounted to 1000 shares. In the bond
division Oregon Short Line fours,
Union Pacific convertible fours and
Burlington fours were in demand at
substantial advances.
After the close of the market a long
conference was held at the offices of
J. P. Morgan & Co. Those who at
tended Included Morgan. Harriman,
Hill, Lamont, Perkins, J. P. Morgan
Jr.. Francis Linde Stetson of counsel
for J. P. Morgan & Co. and ex-Judge
Dunn of Minneapolis, Hill's personal
legal adviser.
Messrs. Hiir and Harriman left the
Morgan banking house arm in arm and i
apparently in the best of spirits. Both
declined to make any statement be
yond saying that a perfect understand
ing had boen reached all around.
At the banking houee of Kuhn, Loeb
& Co. the chief financial backers of the
Harriman system of . railroads, no
statement of any sort was forthcom
ing. A report that the firm had,! as the
Harriman representatives, received a
substanthil cash bonus for agreeing to
the distribution plan could not be veri
fied. The street heard that Hill-Mor
gan interests would be given repre
sentation in the Union Pacific road, in
return for which Union Pacific inter
ests would be asked to take a place
in the Northern Pacific directors.
Sales of Union Pacific common ag
gregated over 400,000 shares at a net
advance of 8V4 points. Southern Pa
cific was traded in to the extent of
161,000 shares, gaining net 2% points.
The advance in the 1000 shares of Great
Northern preferred was 7iÂ£ points. On
all the Pacifies in fact the market went
higher with the boom in the Northern
Securities stock.
On . the -, curb Northern Securities
made- a net gain of 6 points on the j
Bales of about 23,000 shares. The stoclr I

This demand was refused, the home
claiming the moneys should go to the
post fund under the rule cited. The
executor resolved to test the Â¦validity
of the rule, and to that end brought a
suit which was heard In the Superior
Court Saturday. In to-day's decision
tbe court held the rale to be absolutely
void. It being directly in conflict with
the laws governing the disposition of
estates cf decedents.
In the Veterans' Home at Yountville
there are 600 or 600 Inmates, and over
half of this number are receiving pen
sions from the United States. As this
decision affects .all these pensioners
and perhaps those In like Institutions
elsewhere. Its Importance can be read
ily conceived.
DECISION AGAINST HOME.
There i3 a rula^adopted by the board
of directors which provides that in case
of the death of a pensioner, any pen
sion money due him and remaining in
the hands of the treasurer shall be paid
to the deceased v/idow, minor children
or dependent parents, and in case ther*
are no such heirs the money shall 'M
paid into the post fund of the home.
William Hi Coffey had been a mem
ber of the home for three years prior
to his death, which occurred last April.
At that time he had on deposit certain
pension moneys which by the terms of
his will were bequeathed to a nephew
in the East. N. W. Collins, who was
named In the will as executor, imme
diately demanded from the home these
moneys amounting to some hundred^ of
dollars.
RULE AT YOUNTVTLLE.
* NAPA. March 22.â A decision of far
reaching: Importance was to-day ren
dered by Judge Gesford In the case of
N. -W. Collins., as executor of the will
of James H. CoCfey. .deceased, against
the Board of Directors of the Veterans"
Home of California.
The suit was brought to test the
right claimed by the board of directors
to retain the pension moneys of de
ceased members of the home. When
an ex-soldier wishes to become an in
mate of the home at Yountville ha
must siarn an application in which ho
agrees, if he Is receiving a pension, to
turn in all future pension moneys to
the treasurer of the Institution, which
money during bi3 lifetime Is subject tu
his control. He also agrees to conform
co all rules and regulations of the
home.

All efforts were futile, however, and
the trades building was soon a heap of
ashes. There were a number of nar
row escapes from injury' by falling
timbers.
IONE, March 22-â The most dis
astrous fire that ever occurred at the
Preston School of Industry here de
stroyed the trades building at about 10
o'clock to-night. Fora time while the
flames were making a^hes of the costly
structure it was feared that every
other building, on the grounds would
be lost in the ruining blaze. The loss
is estimated at $30,000.
The fire started in the furnace-room
and gained surprisingly rapid head
way. The youthful inmates of the
other buildings were hurried from
their dormitories and lent what assist
ance they could to stay the progress
of the fire.
DENVER, March 22.â A proclama
tion was issued by Governor Peaiody
! to-night declaring the county of Las
Â¦ Animas in a. state of insurrection and
Â¦ rebellion.. isubsequently an order was
j issued for 300 Troops under Â¦' command
of Major Zeph T. Hill to proceed to
Trinidad, the county seat.
The men were instructed to gather
aboard trains and their commanders
given sealed orders and told to open
them at midnight. In his ploclamation
I the Governor says that there exists in
Las Animas C6unty a certain class of
Individuals who are fully armed and
acting together, resisting, the laws of
the State and ..offering violence to
citizens and property.
The civil authorities of the county
are cuoted as authority for the state
ment that not less than 1500 unem
ployed men are armed in apparent an
ticipation of an open conflict.
Las Animas County forms the larger
portion of the Southern Colorado codl
fields, where the members of the
United Mine Workers of America have
been on strike for several months.
The new plan was formally* adopted

What Women Once Couldn't Wear.
While we may pick and choose and do
exactly as we please about our clothes,
there have been, In times gone by, in
many countries, and even in our own,
what were known as "sumptuary
laws." These laws regulated expendi
ture for dress, for ornament, for food,
'or for whatever refreshments you might
give company when they came to take
tea.
Among the first of these sumptuary
laws was one made in Rome in 215
B. C, and called the "Oppian law." It
declared that no woman should possess
more than half an ounce of gold, wear
a dress of different colors, or ride' in
a vehicle'ln the city, or within a mile
of it except on occasions of public re
ligious ceremonies. The law lasted only
. twenty years.
Italy and France are the countries
where most of these laws have been
passed, and some of them read very
strangely. In 1330, in Italy, no woman
was allowed to wear a dress with fig
ures on it; she could only have them
embroidered. And in 1348 in the same
country neither dark green nor black
dresses were allowed to be worn in the
morning.â St. Nicholas.

Oil Joints of Your Umbrella.
A former peddler, now a rich insur
ance man, stood in a sheltered corner
during a big storm and watched the
umbrellas go to pieces as the wind hit
them full force. "Probably all those
umbrellas are wrecks because of the
lack of a little oil," he said. "That's a
trick I learned as a peddler." An um
brella is primarily a , thing of joints,
and to keep it. in good condition the'
joints should be oiled. I found that
nearly all umbrellas break in the joints
first, and why shouldn't they? The
joints are never oiled, and yet are ex
pected to respond easily to sudden
opening. To get the best use out of
an umbrella the joints should be oiled
first with coal oil or kerosine, to clean
off the rust, and then with a lubricat
ing oil to make them work easily. Thus
treated an umbrella framework will
last indefinitely."â Wilkesbarre Leader.

the stormy weather which is gener
ally experienced in the Highlands of
Scotland in these months. Then most
unexpectedly one smart snowstorm
followed another and the condition of
the stags, especially in the little-wood
ed forests, became a matter of grave
anxiety. The Field states that in spite
of hand feeding many deer now pre
sent a sorry appearance. In the larger
and better forests artiflicial feeding is
now being carried on on a liberal scale.
At one particular spot in a certain
forest no fewer than 300 stags are reg
ularly fed every day and have already
become familiar with the call of their
feeders. â London Globe.

match to-dav from Alec Knox. "I
thought that Jes fer fun I'd try a big
hotel, you see, an* so I walked on into
one â no more oÂ£ 'era fer me. The first
blamed thing, a soldier boy run up an'
grabbed my grip, an' would 'a' stole
it, but you bet I landed him a clip. He
fell a-sprawlln' on the floor a-shakin'
like a leaf. I hung onto that grip an'
sez, 'Git out, you little thief.' Well,
then I ast 'em fer a room. A feller

where things, I.knowed, was right, an*

TRAGEDIES ARE MANY
IN THE TOWNS OF TEXAS
Epidemic of Murder and Suicide 'in
a Single Day in the Ixme
Star State.
â¢ HOUSTON, Tex., March 22. â There
was an unusual number of tragedies
on, Texas soil to-day, an epidemic of
suicide and murder having seemingly
broken out. At Fort Worth John Wil
bur Duboise, aged 43, shot .himself.
At El Paso "Max Wunderwalt, a boiler
maker, slew his wife, two children
and himself with ' a revolver. Mat
Taylor, aged 21, a butcher, blew out
his brains at Houston. '
At Temple A. Chandler entered the
telephone office, where his wife was
employed as chief operator, shot her
three times and then fired three bul
lets into Manager William McLaugh
lin, to whom she was talking. At
Fairfield eight persons drank water
poisoned by unknown persons. Jas
per Lenox and two children are dead.
Near Whitfield Joe Grimes was kill
ed by negroes as an outcome of race
troubles.
WASHINGTON, March 22.â The Sen
ate spent the greater part of the day
on the Indian appropriation bill. Lodge*
took exception to the provision ex
empting candidates for the position of
Indian agency farmers frbm civil ser
vice examination,' and, on^his sugges-"
tion the amendment was passed over
without "action. \.y}*- ..,'.Â¦ X
' Later .in< the, day Senator-elect Dick
of Ohio appeared In J : he Senate cham
ber. He went ' direct to' Senator Fora
ker's seat ' and was cordially greeted," 1
but their conference" was cufe short by~
the announcement of an ;Â«cecutive ses
sion, from>which Dick', not yet having
bad the path of olfice, was excluded
under the rules of the Senate. The first
discussion was in connection with the
bill over .the House provision permit
ting superintendents of Indian schools
to act as Indian agents. Spooner
called attention to the fact that school
superintendents are appointed as the
result of civil service examinations,
whereas Indian agents are appointed
by the President and confirmed by the
Senate. He said that to adopt the
resolution would be for the Senate to
abandon its functions. The resolution
was defended by Stewart, Dubois and
Platt of Connecticut, as calculated to
promote the service in the conduct of
business at. the agencies. .
The provision was amended by strik
ing out the word "hereafter," which
has the effect of confining the opera
tion of the clause to the next fiscal
year. . ."..-.
Lodge made a point of order. against
the amendment relieving the agency
farmers from civil service examination.
Messrs. Stewart, McCumber, Teller
and Platt of ponhecticut contended
that the provision is necessary in order
to procure efficient service, and said
that a collegiate education is not neces
sary to efficiency in teaching agricul
ture to the Indians.
Gorman: criticized the provision as
showing a tendency to get away from
the requirements of the' civil service
law*.,; He 'referred to reported utter
ances -by: Admiral Walker in favor of
Â¦the suspension of the law in its appli
cation to the isthmian canal commis
sion.
Spooner supported the, amendment,
paying that to require farmers and
stockmen of the aliens to pass civil
service is "absolute nonsense" and
away beyond the intention of the orig
inal civil service reformers. Gorman
said he agreed^largely 'with Spooner's
.view, but Congress did * not act by
piecemeal In modifying the civil ser
vice laws.
At Lodge's request the amendment,
together with that of a similar na
ture relating to the employment of
matrons at Indian agencies, was
passed over.
The committee amendments author
izing the Commission on Indian ?Af
fairs to exercise supervision of the
renting of homesteads and surplus
lands by the Creek, Choctaw, Chlcka
saw and Cherokee Indians in Indian
Territory, requiring the recording of
all leases of land by the five civilized
tribes, and authorizing the Secretary
of the Interior to dispossess lessees
claiming leases obtained by fraud or
by inadequate consideration, were
stricken from the bill on points of
order.
Without completing: thÂ« reading of
the bill the Senate at 5 p. m. went into
executive session and at 5:15 ad
journed.
WASHINGTON, \ March 22.â General
Instructions to the members of the
Isthmian Canal Commission, contained
in a letter from President Roosevelt
to the. commission under date of
March 8, were read at a meeting to
day. They are as follows:
I have appointed you as the commission
which Is. to undertake the most Important and
also the most formidable engineering feat that
has hitherto teen attempted. You are to do
the work, the doing of which, if well done,
will reflect high honor upon this nation, and
when done will be of incalculable benefit, not
only to this nation, but to civilized mankind.
As you yourselves must Individually know, I
have chosen you with reference to nothing save
my belief, after full and patient inquiry, that
you are among all the available men of whom
I have knowledge those best fitted to bring
this great task to a successful conclusion.
You have been chosen because of your personal
and professional reputations for Integrity and
ability. You represent thÂ« whole country.
You represent neither section nor party. I
have not sought to find out the politics of a
single one of you, and, indeed, as to the ma
jority of you I have not the slightest Idea
what your political affiliations are.
I believe that each one of you will serve
not merely with entire fidelity, but with the
utmost efficiency. If at any time I feel that
any one of you is not rendering the best ser
vice whicn It Is possible to procure, I shall
feel called upon to disregard alike my feelings
for the man and the man's own feelings and
forthwith to substitute for him on the commis
sion seme other man whom I deem capable of
rendering better service. Moreover. I shall
expect, if at any time any one of you feels that
the work is too exhausting and engrossing for
him to do In the best possible manner, that
he will of his own accord so Inform me. In
order that I may replace him by some man
who to the requisite ability joins the will and
the strength tc give all the effort needed. But
so long aa you render efficient service of the
highest type in the work you are appointed to
perform you may rest assured of my hearty
support and backing in every way.
WANTS BUSINESS METHODS.
These are the conditions under which you
have been appointed and under which I shall
expect you to proceed. I shall furthermore
expect you to apply precisely the same prin
ciples in the choice and retention of the sub
ordinates who do the work under you as I
have applied In your choice, and shall apply
in your retention. I shall expect you to ap
point no man for reasons other than your
belief In the aid he can render you In digging
the canal. If, having appointed any man.
you find that your expectations about him ar\j
not fulfilled or that Iron: nny reason he falls
short of his duty. I shall expect you to ills
miss him out of hand; I shall expect that
under such circumstances you will pay not
ths slightest heed to any backing or influence
the man may have. I assume as a matter
o! course tha* In dealing with contractors you
will act on precisely the principles which
would apply In any great private business
undertaking. There Is no man among you to
whem I think It 13 necessary to say a word
a3 to the standard of honesty to be exacted
frcm every employe or contractor: for If I
had the slightest ground for suspicion that
there were need to say such a word to any
of you I should not have appointed him. But
I do wish to emphasize the need of unceasing
vigilance in the performance of this great
work.
QUESTION* OP SANITATION".
As to the details ot the work Itself. I have
but little to say. It is to be done as expe
ditlnusiy as- possible, , and as economically ae
Is consistent with thoroughness There Is one
matter to which I ask your special attention â
the question of sanitation and hygiene. You
â¢will take measures to secure the best medical
experts for this purpose whom you can ob
tain, and you will. o( course, make the con
tractors submit as implicitly as your own
employes to all the rules and regulations or
you will find it best to have onÂ» head for
this medical department, but that 1 shall
leave to your own Judgment.
The plans are to be carefully made, with
a view to the needs not only ot the moment
but of the future. The expenditures are to be
supervised as rigorously as if they were being
made for a private corporation dependent fcr
Its profits upon the returns. You are to se
cure the best talent this country can afford
to meet the conditions created by every need
which may arise The methods for achieving
the results must be yours. What this nation
will Insist upon lj> that the results be achieved.

To the Isthmian Canal Commission.
WASHINGTON, March 22.â Outside
of a few routine matters the House
devoted' the entire day to further dis
cussion of the postoflice appropriation
bill, but disposed of only one page of
the bill. . .. ' - â¢
Mr. Butler of Pennsylvania endeav
ored unsuccessfully to have passed an
amendment to transfer back to the of
fice of the First Assistant Postmaster
General jurisdiction of the free deliv
ery and rural delivery service, which
caused Mr. Moon of Tennessee, the
ranking minority member of the com
mittee, to administer a rebuke to those
members who are trving to take the
Fourth Assistant Postmaster General's
duties given him under the law. He
said there was a motive behind it all
and that certain members, chafing un
der the recent report of the Postofflce
Department, are seeking to punish
Bristow for discovering frauds in an
other bureau of the department.
An amendment by Mr. Tawney of
Minnesota, which was agreed to, pro
hibits the Postmaster General from or
dering out of postoflices telephone com
panies other than the Bell Telephone
Company.
Charles B. Landis of Indiana called
attention to what he said was the ri
diculous practice of the department in
renting canceling machines, and of
fered an amendment for their purchase
outright. During the last year he said
the department spent $176,000 for this
purpose. He spoke of a machine which
he said could be bought outright by
the Government for $325. In four
years, he said, the rental of each ma
chine in the service amounted to $1600.
Mr. . Stafford of Wisconsin opposed
the amendment and said the committee
appointed, to investigate the subject
had recommended against purchasing
machines, because they are soon worn
out.
Mr. Overstreet also opposed the
amendment, saying the cost would be
enormously increased should the Gov
ernment be unable to purchase the ma
chines. The Landis amendment was
agreed to, 64 to 38. ;â¢ ;;.....
The resignation of Charles Dick, a
Representative from Ohio, to take ef
fect at noon to-morrow, .was read.
At 5:32 the House adjourned.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March 22.â Judge Mar
tin _T. .McMason, who has returned to
New York, said to The Call correspond
ent to-day:
"I have no special means of knowing
whd will be elected superintendent of
the Soldiers' Home at Los Angeles. The
office is not appointive. The various su
perintendents are elected by joint reso
lution of Congress for a term of six
"years. There are eleven of them, and
the President of the United States, the
Secretary of War and the Chief Justice
of the- Supreme Court are ex-offlcio
members.
5- "I have heard General Shaf ter's name
most favorably mentioned for the of
fice, , also that of ex-Governor Mark
ham and Colonel Smedberg. Naturally
the members of the House Military
Committee have much to say concern
ing the selection, and as their report is
almost invariably adopted by the
House and Senate the choice practically
rests with them. My own term expires
next month, together with four others',
but I have heard nothing to indicate
whether the committee has decided
whom to elect."

WHAT TEA DOES TO
RHEUMATICS.
When you next take tea. think of th!Â«.
Tea contains 1T5 grains of Uric Acid
In every potinct
Meat contains only flve to seven
(rains.
Rheumatism IÂ« Uric Acid In the blood.
UrJc Acid accumulates from food when
the digestive apparatus ear.not create
enough Alkaline elements (like soda) to
neutralize It.
This Add collects urea, or worn-out
waste matter, from the system.
That Urea enters the blood when Alka-
line action has not previously dis-
solved it.
By and by the waste matter reaches
the joints and muscles, through circula-
tion of the blood.
There It gradually deposits in solid
particles, like' granulated sugar.
These solid particles grind between
the Joints and muscles at every move-
ment.
This grinding causes Irritation and
pain.
These in turn may develop inflamma-
tion and swelling. That inflammation
bestirs Nature to help herself.
. She proceeds to coat the hard Uric par-
ticles over with cushions of pulpy mu-
cous, like the first healing strata of an
outer sore.
This pulpy covering grows to thÂ«
bones, as well as to the particles deposit-
ed. There it hardens like plaster or
sealing wax. Then we have "'bony
Joints, almost inflexible, and usually
fixed in a bonded position, from the paia
and inflammation.
That is Rheumatism at its worst.
It is bad enough before it gets that
far.
There is but one sure way of curing
Rheumatism. The flrst step Is to neutral-
ize the Uric Acid already in the system.
Next, to dissolve, and carry away, the
hard deposits that grind between the
joints. Then get the digestive apparatus
Into such healthy condition that it will,
unaided, produce less Uric Acid, and
more Alkaline*.
This is what Doctors generally havÂ«
failed to do.
It Is what I studied a lifetime to ac-
complish, and achieved only after many
failures and thousands of experiments.
At last I found, in Germany, a Solvent
which was not only effective, but abso-
lutely safe to use.
Few agents powerful enough to be ef-
fective in Rheumatism are safe.
My discovery, now called "Dr. Shoop n
Rheumatic Cure." acts directly, but in-
ternally, .upon Uric Acid in the Joints
and muscles.
It dissolves, and carries off. the pain-
ful deposits, producing an immediate Al-
kaline condition of the blood, and neu-
tralizing the Acid in it which would
have fed the Rheumatism and extended
the disease.
It won't restore bony joints to flpxibil-
Ity. and it can't undo,- in a week. thÂ«
damage caused by years of rheumatic
condition.
But it will benefit every casÂ». and it
will entirely cure most cases of Rheuma-
tism.
So sum am I of this, that I will supply
Dr. Snoop's Rheumatic Cure, to any sick
one who writes me for it. on a month's
trial, at my risk.
If it succeeds, the cost to him is only
$5.50 for the six bottl- treatment.
If it fails. I bear the whole cost my-
self.
And â he alone shall be the Judgeâ
shall decide who shall pay.
Surely you will not continue to suffer
when you can thus get well, at my risk.
I have written an important Treatis*
on Rheumatism, telling of its relief and
cure.
It is free to Rheumatic people.
Write me a post card for It to-day.

Harry C. Pennington was recalled to
testify that as far as he knew the
only box of candy In the Pennington
home on August 9, 1898, was that which
was received by Mrs. Dunning and
which Is an exhibit in the case. â¢
Dr. Theodore R. Wolfe. State chem
ist for Delaware and professor of chem
istry at the' Delaware , State Univer
sity, was the next witness. He it was
who made the analysis ef three pieces
of candy taken from the box by Dr.
Bishop and submitted to Dr. Wolfe.
The chemist testified that he broke the
three pieces and extracted : from : them
several lumps of white, crystallized sub
stance. Then he treated the candy to
five recognized tests for the discovery
of arsenic and succeeded in recovering
.42 of a grain from It. Subsequently
he tested the lumps removed from the
candy and found them to J3e arsenic,
weighing 11.66 grains. â¢ He stated that
a fatal dose of arsenic was from two
to four grains, varying as regards the
condition of the system.
- In making the analysis he used the
Marsh test; the Reinch test, a pecu
liarly delicate one; the manganese test;
the charcoal reduction test and 'the
sulphuretted hydrogen test, and with
all of these arsenic .was -found in the
candy after the removal of Hhe'lumps,
and the lumps also were ascertained
to be arsenic The results of all of his
Knight started to air some of his
recently acquired medical knowledge,
but he found Dr. Downs so thoroughly
Intrenched at all points in medical mat-*
ters that the attorney quickly aban
doned this line "of attack. He finally
succeeded in bringing out that the doc
tor did not regard lump arsenic and
powdered arsenic as essentially differ
ent, both being chemically the same
and differing only mechanically. Much
stress was laid on this point by the
defense, as it is purposed to show that
the arsenic In the candy was lump ar
senic, which is not readily obtainable
at pharmacies. Dr. Downs also ad
mitted that he had been promised $500
in addition to his expenses for his 'trip
westward and the consequent loss of
business.
Dr. Pressley S. Downs, a graduate of
the University of Pennsylvania and a
medical practitioner for twenty-five
years, proved an entirely different kind
of witness, and Attorney Knight
handled him gingerly and cautiously.
Dr. Downs was called to the bedside of
Mrs. Dunning the morning after the
death of Mrs. Deane. After an exam
ination he at once positively diagnosed
the case as one of arsenical poisoning,
and so informed Dr. Bishop. He said
he had not the slightest doubt of it and
did not need an autopsy to convince
him, but thought one should have been
made as a matter of corroboration. He
described the symptoms at length and
made intelligent differentiations be
tween ptomaine and arsenical poison
ing and cholera morbus.
tlon to his expenses for coming to the
coast to testify in the case. He Identi
fied the box of candy in evidence as the
same as that he had seen in the Pen-:
nington home, and testified to taking
five pieces of the candy to Dr. Wolfe
for analysis. He gave as a reason why
he did not perform autopsies on the
bodies of the dead women that the
family objected to such a course. He
admitted that he had made a mistake,
and said that he should have overruled
the objection. His testimony the
morning session.
Had no doubts.
He had previously met Mrs. Botkin
at the Baldwin Hotel pharmacy, where
he had been introduced to her by ont
of the clerks. Grey was rather weak
in his identification of Mrs. Botkin
yesterday, although he stated that as
far as he could judge she was the
same woman who purchased from him
two ounces of arsenic nearly six years
drug store, where he was employed as
a pharmacist, and purchased two
ounces o* arsenic, stating that she
wished to use it, for the purpose of
bleaching straw -hats. He fixed the
occurrence In his mind largely by the
poison record of the store, wherein
there was an entry of sale of two
ounces of arsenic to "Mrs. Bothin,"
who gave her residence as the "Victoria
Hotel, corner of Hyde and California
streets.
tests were attached to a large card,
together with the vial containing the
arsenic recovered. This was introduced
in evidence. *
Attorney Knight made no attempt
to cross-examine Dr. Wolfe on his
analyses, but he went deeply into the
question as to the difference between
lump and powdered arsenic. The chem
ist explained that arsenic in its manu
facture was an incrustation on the
walls of a cooling chamber, on which
it was deposited. This was broken off
and subsequently reduced to whatever
fineness was desired. In answer to the
question as to whether or not lump
arsenic was readily procurable at phar
macies the chemist stated that he did
not knoiv, although It was widely dis
tributed as an article-of commerce.

He was not very clear on the differ
ence in symptoms between arsenical
and ptomaine poisoning and cholera
morbus. Attorney Knight took him far
afield in search of the tetanus germ
and the effect of antitoxin in diphthe
ria cases, where the doctor floundered
hopelessly and finally admitted that he
knew very little about bacteriology. He
admitted that at no time did he admin
ister peroxide of iron to either patient,
although he said he knew it was the
generally accepted antidote in cases of
arsenical poisoning.
"What causes the decomposition of
meat?" asked Knight.
"Oh, the atmosphere and moisture, I
suppose," answered the doctor.
"Do you know that fish are the great
est field for the production of pto
maines?" asked Knight.
Dr. Bishon admitted that this infor
mation was new to him. Judge Cook
finally came to the rescue by declaring
that the cross-examination was being
unnecessarily drawn out. The witness
admitted that he received $500 in addi-
LIMITS EXPLANATION.
Dunning appeared on the stand "find
eyed her scornfully before beginning
her testimony.
Joshua D. Deane, husband of one of
the murdered women, was the first
witness called In the morning session.
He told of how his wife was taken ill
shorly before midnight on August 9,
IS 98, the same date on which she had
partaken of the candy. She was suf
fering from severe pains in her
stomach and a burning sensation, ac
companied by vomiting. She grew
worse, despite the household remedies
administered for cholera morbus, and
at 9 o'clock the fiollowing morning Dr.
Bishop was called in. Mrs. Deane
grew steadily worse until August 11,
when she showed some improvement,
during the forenoon. In the after
noon a collapse occurred and she died
after suffering a terrible convulsion.
Drs. Bishop Â»and Davis were at her
bedside. Mrs. Dunning was showing
the same symptoms at this time and
died the following day at 9 a. m.
On cross-examination Attorney
Knight asked Deane if he knew E. E.
Clement of Dover. "I do," replied the
witness. "He tried to blackmail me
before I left."
"In what way?" persisted Knight.
The District Attorney objected to the
tone of the question and remarked, "I
didn't, expect that the defense would
bring that out on cross-examination."
"Well, let It be stricken out," said
Knight, and the Clement element in the
case was lost to disclosure.
Miss Leila Deane was recalled to
make a minor correction in her testi
; mony of the previous day, having re
freshed her memory by reading. her tes
timony at the former trial.
PLEADS IGNORANCE.
Dr. Lemuel H. Bishop was the next
witness. He was the attending physi
cian on Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane
during their fatal illness and was pres
ent at the deathbed of both. He de
scribed the symptoms of each as con
sisting of inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the throat, pains and
burning sensations In the stomach,
nausea and vomiting, flushed skin and
swollen bodies. Asked the direct ques
tion by the District Attorney, he stated
that he was positive that their deaths
were caused by arsenical poisoning.
Attorney Knight took the physician
in hand and drew from him the fact
that it was not until after the death \
of Mrs. Deane and when Mrs. Dunning
.was beyond medical aid that he had de
termined that the cause of their Illness
was arsenical poisoning. At first he
had treated them for cholera morbus,
and failing to relieve them he had ap
parently gone It blind in hopes that
some of the medicines he administered
might bring relief. He had given
strychnia to stimulate the heart action,
morphine to allay vomiting, digitalis,
creosote, pepsinoids and other things. >
Finally he administered egg albumen, \
j which he said was an excellent antidote
for arsenical poisoning, but he naively
admitted that he bullded better than
he knew, because at that time he had
no idea that his patients were victims
of arsenic. Â¦
The defendant, her sister and her
brother-in-law. X. C. McClure of
Healdsburg, sat together. Mrs. Botkin
possessed herself of a printed tran
script of the testimony given at the
former trial and followed It closely as
the various witnesses testified. Occa
sionally she would whisper suggestions
to Attorney McGowan, who sat beside
her. She was not noticeably nervous,
but displayed some emotion when Miss
DEFENDANT IS CALM.
Thereafter none was admitted to the
room.
Excellent progress was made yester- |
flay In Superior Judge Cook's court in
the -trial of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin,
charged with the murder of Mrs. John
P. Dunning In August, 1898, by send
ing to her at Dover. Delaware, a box
of poisoned candy from this city, of
which candy Mrs. Dunning and her
e!ster, Mrs. Joshua D. Deane, partook
and from the effect* of which they
both died a few days later.
By the testimony of Drs. Bishop and
Dcnvcs of Dover, the prosecution seem
ingly la-tisfactorily established the fact
that thÂ« tfeath of thÂ« two women was
du* to arsenical poisoning. Both
physicians were positive of this fact.
Dr. Bishop was far from being an lm
.prcszlv* witness aad Attorney Knight,
Â¦who had primed himself for the Â©c
csjttea. tock thÂ» Eastern physician
ever ths medical hurdles until he
balked and took refuge from pertinent
questions In a plea of Ignorance. On
th* other hand. Dr. Downs was ready
in his answers, positive in his opin
ions and prepared to explain intelli
gently and convincingly. When he first
appeared on the stand he was asked
to describe the symptoms that afflict
ed Mrs. Dunning when he first saw
her and he ripped out such a string of
sesquipedalian medical terms that the
stenographer nearly succumbed to
neurasthenia- The doctor obligingly
spelled out all the hard names and
then got down on the ground floor and
explained to the laity what they all
meant.
Attorney Knlsht did not have nearly
as much fun irlth him as he did with
Dr. Bishop. His cross-examination was
brief end hinged almost entirely on the
difference between powdered and lump
arsenic. He scarcely attempted to
phake the doctor on his opinion of the
â¢ cause of Mrs. Dunning's death, but
'seemed to derive considerable satisfac
tion when the witness stated that fish
wan a. prolific source of ptomaine pol
Â¦poninp. In this connection Knight let
slip an admission that probably out
.lines the theory of the defense. In
answer to a question. Dr. Downs stated
that the cause of death could not be
ptomaine poisoning. "But 1 think it
"was," said Knight, suavely. "That's
where we differ."
CHEMIST IS CONVINCING.
The most imposing and Important of
the witnesses examined yesterday was
.Dr>. Theodore R. Wolfe, State chemist
â¢ if Delaware and professor of chem
istry 5n Delaware State University. To
him at Newark, Del., Dr. Bishop took
Jive pieces of the candy from the box
received by Mrs. Dunning and he an
alyzed three of them. He subjected
them to five of the recognized tests for
arsenic and found the poison In all
three. The other two he did not an
alyze. He was clear and convincing In
his testimony and no attempt was
made by the defense to impeach either
his knowledge or methods.
A new witness appeared in the per
son of Miss Mary A. Dunning, sister
of John P. Dunning, husband of the
woman for the murder of whom Mrs.
Botkin Is now on trial. Miss Dunning
fills the missing link in tracing the pos
' session of the box of poisoned candy.
By the death of John B. Pennington,
v ho kept the package in his possession
until it was formally turned over to
the Coroner's Jury at the inquest, the
< ha in lacked completeness. For this
rrason her testimony was important.
Another important witness was
Frank. S. Grey, a pharmacist, .who
Bold to Mrs. Botkin two ounces of ar
senic on June L 1898, while in the em
ploy of a local drug store. His identi
fication of the defendant was some
thing of a disappointment to the prose
cution because it lacked positiveness,
but it was sufficiently certain to an
rwer all purposes.
All who could get into the court
room without violating the order made
by Judge Cook that the center and side
.â¢tisles leading to the entrance should
b*> kept clear were present during the
morning and afternoon sessions. Hun
dreds were refused admission by the
police, eight of whom were stationed
withm and without the courtroom to
' kerp the crowds in order. The num
1>cr of women attending was not so
*rreat as on the day before, but there
were plenty of them and they followed
the proceedings closely. When the
Â«loors were opened for the afternoon
session a regular stampede occurred.
Women emerged from the boiling
crowd with their hats off, their gowns
torn and their hair disheveled. Even
the big policemen were unable to stem
the rush until the courtroom was
overfilled. Then all those who could
not find standing room in the allotted
places 'were compelled to withdraw.
"I am as positive as one can be who
has not seen the person in question for
four or five years." .
"But are you absolutely sure?"
queried the attorney.
The witness admitted that he was
not absolutely sure and even reading
his testimony at the former trial, when
the identification was positive, failed
to bring certainty to his mind. He ex
plained the spelling oÂ«. the - name'
"Bothin" as being what he understood
her to say her name was when she
purchased the poison.'..
Miss. Mary A. Dunning was the clos
ing witness of the day. She is a resi
dent of t Philadelphia and lives with
her brother, John P. Dunning. "When
she read in the papers of the death of
Mrs. Dunning, she went at once to
Dover, arriving there on August 13.
On August 16 she was shown the box
of poisoned candy and the wrapper it
came In, and in the evening of the
same day she was again shown them.
At that time they were In the posses
sion of John B. Pennington, father . of
the two murdered women, who has
since died. On August 22 she saw him
hand the box and wrapper to the
Coroner and one of the jurors, who
called at the Pcnnington home to se
cure them. She identified the box and
wrapper introduced as exhibits as
being the same shown her by John
B. Pennington in Dover. .
At the conclusion of her testimony
court adjourned until 10 o'clock this
morning, after the usual admonition
had been given the jurors not to dis
cuss the fcase nor read 'anything in
the papers concerning it.
A dispatch was received from Dover
last night to the effect that the death
certificate of Mrs. John P. Dunning Is
missing from the office of the Recorder
of Deeds. District Attorney Byington
states that the certificate is not neces
sary as evidence in the hearing "of the
case, for he is in possession of the
Coroner's certificate and has all the
evidence pertaining to the death of
Mrs. Dunning.
"Are you absolutely certain that this
defendant Is the woman to whom you
sold two ounces of arsenic on June 1
1898?" asked "Attorney McGowan.

AN* ABSOLUTE NECESSITY.
So Thinks at Least One Traveling
Man.
I would as soon think of starting
out without my mileage books and grip
as to start out on a trip without a box
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in my
valise, said a traveling man who repre-
sents a St. Louis hardware house.
Why? Because I have to put up at
all kinds of hotels and boardins-
hoitses. I have to eat good, bad and
indifferent food at all hours of the day
and night and *!â¢ don't believe any
man's stomach will stand that sort of
thing without protest, any way I know
mine won't. It has to have some-
thing to break the fall and Stuart'a
Dyspepsia Tablets Is the crutch I fall
back on. '
My friend3 often "josh" me about
it, tell me I'm an easy mark for patent
medicine fakers, that advertised medi-
cines are humbugs, etc., but I notice
, that they are nearly always complain-
ing of their aches and pains and poor
digestion, while I can stand most any
old kind of fare and feel good and
ready for my work when it needs me,
and I believe I owe my good digestion
and sound health to the daily, regular
usÂ«of Stuart'a Dyspepsia Tablets, year
In and year out, and all the "Joshing"
in the world ;will never convince mÂ»
to the contrary.
I used to have heartburn about
three times a day and a headache
about three or four times a week and
after standing for this for four* or flvÂ«
years I > began to look around for a
crutch and found it when my doctor
told me the best investment I could
make would be a 50 cent box of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and I have
invested about 50 cents a month for
them ever since and when I stop to
think that that is what I spend every
day for cigars. I feel like shaking
hands with myself, for I can keep my
stomach and digestion in first-class or-
der for 50 cents a month. I don't care
for any better life insurance.
My druggist tells me they are the
most popular of all stomach medi-
cines and that they have maintained
their popularity and success because
they do as advertised. They bring re-
sults, and results are what count In
patent medicine as much as In selling
barb wire.

ST. PETERSBURG, March 22.â The
Russ in an editorial to-day on Russia's
new. protest against the violation of
The Hague convention in bombarding
the Quarantine hospitals on the San
shantao Islands . (opposite Port Dalny)
declares Japan cannot meet the charge
by pleading ignorance of the character
of the buildings on the Islands, as the
bombardment of unfortified towns and
buildings is forbidden by the same con
vention, and adds that Japan's act was
a flouting of all the powers signatory
to the convention.
"Who knows," continues the Russ,
"what excesses Japan may go â¢ to in
violation of international law? The ob
ligations assumed by her, the feeling
of solidarity among the nations and the
defense of the fundamental principles
of humanity, must compel the world,
If not to-day, then to-morrow,- to say
to Japan: 'Thus far and no farther.'"
s The editorial concludes with express
ing the hope that Russia's protest will
make an impression upon the other
powers.
TOKIO, March 22.â The Japanese

Japanese in Siberia to retunWo Japan.
According to information received here
comparatively few Japanese are now in
Siberia. Most of them left there just
prior to or after the breaking out of
the war. The United States embassy,
which is charged with safeguarding
Japanese interests, has thus far only
responded to the appeals of a score of
Japanese coming from Siberia through
European Russia. The last party of
twelve, from, Irkutsk, was sent to Ber

After consulting together and with
the Government, both political parties
agreed to support the Government pro
Â£ramme of war taxes, but to lower
slightly the proposed rate of land tax
and reject the taxes on salt and silk
stuffs, thereby reducing the projected
revenue about $5,000,000. The political
parties further display a disposition .o
limit the period for the levying of in
creased taxes to one year after the
conclusion of the war. This implies a
radical change, inasmuch as the In
creased revenue thereby ceases to be
available for reducing the new debt.

COPENHAGEN. March 22. â By au
thority of the East Asiatic Company it
was learned to-day that the capture of
the company's steamship Manchuria
deprived Russia of 7000 tons of ammu
nition intended for the large long
range gruns in Port Artfcur. It is said
that if the Manchuria had reached
Port Arthur safely the whole situation
would have been changed. It is known
that the Russian Government regard
ed the Manchuria's cargo as of the
highest importance.-; '
While at Suez in October of last
year the Manchuria was partly burned.
It was repaired at this port on rush
orders from St. Petersburg for the spe
cial purpose of conveying ammunition
to the Far East. The cargo was valued
at nearly a million dollars. Its cap
ture is said to account for the ina
bility of. the Russians to make effect
ive use of their long-range guns. The
Manchuria was only two, days' sail
from Port Arthur when she was seized.
She was navigated by a Danish naval
officer on formal leave of absence.

MUKDEN, March 22. â The train north this afternoon from' Dalny brought five wounded for

ing shortly after 11 o'clock. They say that great holes were torn in the forts'^ batteries were dis
mounted, houses destroyed and the Government biddings completely wrecked. Five soldiers were
killed and ten wounded by one shell on, Silver Hill. An entire family was destroyed by a- shell,
which went clear throngh two houses before it exploded in their main. room. Several houses were
on fire at one time. One hundred shells fell in the old city, one-third of theni exploding, between 9
Women and children ran from the town early in the morning, in a blinding. storm of rain, far
out of reach of the enemy's fire. One-third of the soldiers in the Golden Hill fort were wounded
during the morning assault and the list of dead numbered seventeen. The cruisers Askold and Bayan
were hit by six-inch shells.
. The wounded who have come herewere^pn the ground. : 'floor of a house completely wrecked by
a shell. They were injured by .falling' walls. They say -tha'f- more than forty dead were carried out
of the forts before 10 o'clock, and that two shells fell on the.battleship Pobieda, exploding on her
deck in the inner harbor. " ,
While the Japanese battleships were firing from behind the promontory at 9 o'clock the heavy
cruisers went on the west side into Pigeon Bay and fired six-inch shells into the Russian forts in the
rear for an hour and a half. It is not known what damage these accomplished.
"We lost one man during the. bombardment, which ceased after n o'clock, when the enemy's
ships reassembled, and, after passing along the outer roadstead, drew off without attacking our fleet."

cruisers, six second and third class cruisers and eight torpedo-boats, approached from all sides. At
7 oclock our squadron commenced to leave the inner harbor, the cruisers leading, with the Askold,
flying my flag, ahead and the battleships following. '*}*s~>>
"The enemy's battleships approached Liaotheshrn and Tired one hundred shells from their
twelve-inch guns at Port Arthur and I oS shells at the environments of the town.
"Our shells, fired at a range of eighty cables, were well" placed. At about ib o'clock a Japanese
battleship was struck by a shell and retired.. :" *
ST. PETERSBURG, March 22. â The
Emperor received the first message re
garding the attack upon Port Arthur
late this afternoon, but nothing was
allowed to' reach the public until Â»10
o'clock to-night. The dispatches to
the Emperor stated that the Russians
sustained no "great losses, having only
five soldiers killed and ten wounded.
Vice Admiral Makaroff reports that
one of j the Japanese vessels was struck
by a shell.
All information which has reached
St. Petersburg shows that the defend
ers of Port Arthur have taken serious
ly to heart the coup of the Japanese
Yorpedo-boats at the beginning of the
war, and are now maintaining a sharp
lookout.
The Japanese torpedo-boats were
twice discovered sneaking toward the
harbor entrance under cover of dark
ness, but both times they" were Â¦ de-.
tected far out at sea and were driven
off by the hot fire opened on them.
The breaking of day necessarily pre
vented further, torpedo-boat operations,
but Admiral Togo brought his battle
ships and cruisers up. The .' division
of his fleet was for the purpose of mak
ing a cross fire upon the harbor, in the
hope of destroying the town and of
damaging the Russian ships lying in
the basin.
The bombardment of March 9 showed
to the Russians the advantage to. the
enemy of the position off Liaotheshin
which Vice Admiral Togo's ships took
iip this morning, and \ Vice Admiral
Makaroff sought to minimize this ad
vantage by so stationing the battleship
Retvizan that her shells could reach
the Japanese battleships.. The fact that
the Retvizan was used for. this purpose
proves the falsity of the report that her
great^guns had been removed, and in
stalled as a battery at Pigeon Bay, and
it has given rise to the impression that
there is an inadequacy of great guns
at Port Arthur, as otherwise a battery
would have been erected, to protect the
town at the only point which Vice Ad
miral Togo seems to regard as* vulner
able from the sea. /v * .
When the official dispatches were re
ceived the belief gained ground that
Vice Admiral Makaroff had put to sea
and that a naval fight^had taken place.
Later advices established the fact that
the admiral had simply gone with -the
undamaged portion of his fleet to the
outer roadstead, where he could more
effectively support the batteries and at
<he same time take advantage of any
weakness which might develop in the
enemy's attack.
The Russians are continuing prepa
rations for a prospective ; siege of - Port
Arthur, rushing large tiuantitles of sup
plies to* that point. More '.than? forty,
cars loaded with barley, 'chickens and
other foodi' arrive' there daily.

LONDON, March 23.â The Seoul 1 cor

. The Japanese are displaying great
vigor in the construction of a light
railway to Pingyang and other
strategic projects, according to the
correspondent. Should she fail to expel
Russia from Chinese territory and be
compelled to defend the- Korean
frontier, the existence of a railway in
the rear, running to a port within fer
rying distance of Japan, will be of In
estimable value to Japan.

ST. PETERSBURG, March 22.â Vice
Admiral Togo's activity at Port Arthur
is being emulated by the commander of
the Japanese forces in Korea. The rg
port of General Mistchenkow shows
that the Japanese have taken the pre
caution to erect earthworks near Anju,
which are being held by a Japanese di
vision until the remainder of the First
Army Corj>s comes up from Pingyang,
about forty miles away. The advance
of the Japanese shows that they are
losing no time and that they are more
rapid than the Russians expected. Nev
ertheless the fortifications of Anju
show the Japanese operations are ac
companied by all proper military pre
cautions. So far as the Russians are
concerned they have no intention of
attacking Anju, but the province of the
5000 to 6000 cavalrymen under General
MiFtch^nkow will be to harass and re
tard the Japanese in every way possi
ble.
The authorities here believe that it
â¢will be only a matter of a short time
r.ow \vhon active land operations begin,
but at first these will take the form of
skirmishes*, as the main Russian force
remains in occupation of strategic
points on the Yalu River.
The following official dispatch has
b^en received from Viceroy Alexieff,
dated Mukden. March 22:
'"General Mistchenkow reports that
on March 17 our scouts approached
Anju and observed on the left bank of
the Chonech^ng River, opposite Anju,
intrenchments made by the enemy. Up
to that date the enemy had not ap
peared at Ybngpyong, fifteen miles
northeast of Anju. It is supposed that
there is one Japanese division at Anju
and that the remainder of the First
Army Corps is at Pingyang.
"In consequence of the report that
two squadrons of the enemy had ar
rived at Pakchong. fifteen miles north
west of Anju. 200 of our cavalry -was
dispatched for the purpose of prevent
ing the enemy from crossing the Pak
chong River. Our cavalry found three
Japanese squadrons on the left bank
of the river, but they withdrew toward
Anju on the arrival of our detachment
without fighting. The Japanese squad
rons number about 190 men each.
The persistent wooing of an ardent
lover found it3 reward at the Palace
Hotel yesterday evening when Miss
Florida W. Graves, a pretty belle of
Birmingham, Alabama, gave her heart
and hand in marriage to Edward D.
Smith, a resident of her native city.
The happy young bride is the daugh
ter, of Captain W. II. Graves, a promi
nent lawyer of Alabama.*
With' her father and sister. Miss
Virginia Graves, she arrived from the
Southeast several days ago on a pleas
ure tour and coincident with the ar
rival of the Graves was the coming of
E. D. Smith, City Attorney of Bir
mingham, ostensibly in search of rest
and recreation in California. Those
that are acquainted with Mr. Smith
are inclined, however, to strongly sus
pect that Miss Graves' westward jour
ney had something to do with her
lover's coming, j At anjr rate, the
young couple met here and â¢ Mr.
Smith's proposition that their wedding
be celebrated during their sojourn in
California met with the approval of
the young woman and her father and
arrangements for the marriage cere
mony were immediately made. Last
evening Rev. Dr. Hemphill officiated
at the simple service.
In explaining his marriage 3000
miles away from home the happy
groom said that Miss Graves and he
had been engaged for some time and
were' to have been married later' In
Florida, but arriving here they de
cided to hasten the affair and lost no
time in having the marital knot tied.

ST. PETERSBURG. March 22.â It ap
pears that the Japanese, who appar
ently left no stone unturned to obtain
support Drior to the war, went so far
as to send a special agent tc Sweden
in order. to see whether he could pre
vail upon the Swedes, counting upcm
the well known sympathies existing
with them, to fall upon Finland and
acquire that country while Russia'a
hands were tied. The Swedish Gov
ernment, however, -was not taken in
by any such exceedingly naive political
proposal, the acceptance of which
would have been fatal to Sweden, and
the Japanese mission failed.
However, Minister Kurlno's late visit
to Stockholm, which excited curiosity,
may perhaps be in a measure explained
by the foregoing.

In a note to the powers protesting against Japanese procedure Russia claimed that her Minister In
Seoul was notified to leave by Japan's representative /while Korea was yet neutral territory. Japan, re

forced departure of the. Rusian 'legation staff. is published; with this morning's war news.
/Russia suffered a heavy loss in the captureVof the steamship -Manchuria soon after the outbreak of
hostilities. The vessel carried 7000 tons of ammunition intended for the defense of Port Arthur, the car
go being valued at nearly a. million dollars. ; It has been stated in Toklo advices that this ammunition is
reaching its original destination with the assistance of the gunners of Admiral Togo's fleet.
At last there has come.. some hews concerning .land operations in; Northwestern Korea. In an of
ficial report Viceroy Alexieff states that one Japanese' division is stationed at Anju und the rest of the First
Army Corps Is at Pingyang. Intrcnchments have been thrown up by the brown men on the west bank of
the Cheiigcheng: Jtiver, opposite Anju. Japanese cavalry has occupied Yongpyong. fifteen miles northeast of
Anju, with material for pontoon bridges to be used in crossing the river. A force of Russian cavalry Is
operating In Northwestern Korea to harass the Japanese 'advance, but apparently it is the intention of the
Russians to gradually fall' hack -'to the Yaln. . Â¦
A rising 'of Koreans against Japanese soldiers sat Samurig, north of Geiisan, was quickly suppressed,
five Koreans being killed and twenty wounded. . ',
The. ice is breaking up at Newchwang:, thus removing one obstacle to the Japanese operations against
that point. An attempt to capture. Xewchwang probably .will be made without much delay. The Rus
sians are preparing to make desperate^ resistance, as the fall of Newchwang would mean a break in the

seldom seen in the streets of London.
Life Guards, Lancers, Grenadiers,
Hussars, Dragoons and Highlanders,
with their bands, marched through a
lane of brilliant color formed by the
infantry along the â¢ route. Behind
these the spectators formed a con

the sun that had been so seldom seen
of- late by the Inhabitants of the me

Nearly two and a half hours elapsed
before the cortege reached the ceme

excluded. The King and others stood
by' ttie" graveside, while a squad of
Grenadiers fired three volleys for their
old field marshal and the funeral came
to an end.

LONDON, March 22. â The Duke of
Cambridge was buried to-day after a
funeral such as has-been accorded to
no English soldier since the death of
the Duke of Wellington. King Ed
ward, Queen Alexandra and nearly all
the members of the royal family, rep
resentatives of foreign monarchs, a
majority of the nobility, the diplo
matic corps and representative British
subjects of all walks in life attended
the impressive national service at
Westminster Abbey.
Thereafter the body of the "Old
Duke," as he was affectionately known
to the people, was taken to Kensal
Green Cemetery and buried beside that
of his wife. Thousands of troops
marched through and lined the streets
and dense crowds watched the spec
tacle, which in military magnificence
rivaled the funeral of Queen Victor'a.
The King, wearing a field marshal's
uniform, and the Queen, in the deep
est mourning, drove from Buckingham
Palace to the abbey shortly before 11
o'clock. The crowds uncovered in
silence and the troops reversed arms
on their arrival. The abbey was then
packed with diplomats, privy council
ors and army officers, all In gorgeous
uniforms.

6EOTJI* Korea, Feb. 12. â Seoul
to-day has witnessed the clos
ing of the RuEsian legation and the
departure of M. Alexander Pavlov, the
Russian Minister, his family and staff,
;.s well as a complete legation guard
of upward of sixty men. In addition
to the members of the legation and
other Russian officials priests and resi
dents left Korea to seek a haven of
refuge.
At 8 o'clock in the morning large
crowds had assembled at the railway
station, many to say good-by to valued
friends, but more " drawn by curiosity.
In a heavy snowstorm stood American,
British, French, German, Italian, Bel
elan and Japanese Ministers and lega
tion officials to bid farewell to their un
happy Russian colleague, and lined up
on the platforms were some 130 Jap
anese soldiers, restraining the crowd
from interfering with the comfort uf
the travelers.
The special train which had been pro
vided by the Japanese Railway Com
pany left at twenty-five minutes to 9
Â©'clock. It comprised three cars, and
on the platforms of each were stationed
Japanese eoldlers.. Although there was
plenty of color and life, the scene was
anything but a fray one, and bore many
evidences cf sadness, for none of the
passengers were leaving of their own
free will.
In less than one week the active Jap
anese Government had outstripped its
powerful opponent in striving for con
trol of the Hermit Kingdom, and rorne
1500 troops of Japan had quietly and
without opposition marched into Seoul,
thus securing possession of the city,
for it would be the last thought of the
Korean Government to use its army of
20.000 eoldiers against any force of
armed men possessing evidence of
etrength.
The troops had scarcely found rest
in temporary barracks before the Jap
anese Minister sent a polite message tc
the Russian Minister, through his
friend, the Vicomte de Fontenay, the
French Minister, Indicating that his
fT.tir.ued presence In Korea was not
desired at this particular moment.
There was no alternative but to give
immediate compliance to the wishes ex-
Iires-sed by the representative of the
Japanese Government.
HOW THE RUSSIANS LEFT.
At a quarter to ten o'clock the spe
cial train, bearing the Russian Min
ister. M. Pavlov, his family, the lega
tion attache?, his marine guard and the
Il-^i^fian residents of Seoul, eighty-four
}ifr. c or.5 all told, reached the Chemulpo
railway station from Seoul. At the
railway station at Chemulpo were
drawn up two hundred Japanese
troops. At the head <if the hatoba
(landing state), adjacent to the sta
tion, an additional three hundred
ir-'Cipp were nn guard.
Major CJeneral Ic-hichi of the Japan;
ese forces, accompanied M. Pavlov on
the train, alto ML Eugene Dradier,
Vice Consul for France at Seoul. No
others outside of the Russian party
vere allowed on the train. The Rus
sian legation guard, numbering sixty
four marines, vere detrained" fully
armed, with full cartridge belts and
fixed bayonets.
As XL Pavlov, at the head of his
party, with the Russian marines bring
ing up the rear, passed down the line
of Japanese troops, a salute was blown
on the bugles and the men stood at at
tention. The party was joined by the
Consul. M. Pollanovsky and the half
dozen Russian residents of Chemulpo
end proceeded directly to the landing
ctage. where launches and cutters from
both the British cruiser Talbot and
the French cruiser Pascal were wait-
Ing. The party embarked at once and
proceeded to the Pascal, which will
leave for Chefu, China, as soon as ar
rangements are completed with Rear
Admiral Urlu, commanding the Jap
anese fleet at the entrance to the har
bor, for the free passage of the ship.
In spite of the far-reaching Influence
possessed bv M. Pavlov In the Korean
Court up to five days ago, not a single
Korean official was present to wish
him good-by. M. Pavlov's arrivals
action of Japan in ordering him and
his people from a neutial country, al
though, of course, his complaints fell
upon unheeding ears.
One can imagine the consternation
that has come over the Korean court
in witnessing the official- degradation of
the representative of the mighty Czar
of all the Russias.
During the troubles following the
war between China and Japan, in
which unhappy Korea was again the
scene of action, the Korean King flei
to the Russian legation for personal
safety and the expostulation of the
Japanese Minister availed nothing. Tht
King remained with his Russian
friends for nearly eighteen months and
could only be seen within the walls of
the Russian legation until the clamor
ing of his own people induced him to
return to his palace.
Now his Majesty, who has since be
come an Emperor, is in despair,' for he
has no confidence in the promises of
Japan, and his only hope lies in the
iintimate victory of Russia, in whose
vast power he had placed all his re
liance.
Before leaving Seoul the Russian
Minister bitterly protested against the
The French cruiser Pascal, that car
ries M. Pavlov and his party from
Korea, will go to Chefu as soon as per
mission Is obtained to pas3 through
the Japanese fleet.
From Chefu to Port Arthur it is but
eighty, miles, but Just now those eighty
miles are important ones^ as they con
tain a large Japanese fleet engaged. in
attacking Port Arthur, the Gibraltar
of Asia, and it is difficult to say when
M. Pavlov will reach Port Arthur and
be able' to report to Viceroy Alexieff
the full extent of Russia's reverses in
Korea that have occurred In such an
incredibly short space of time.
One of the last official acts of the
departing Russian Minister was to re
quest the aid of the American Min
ister In removing the Russian refugees
from Tuesday's naval engagement at
Chemulpo, now on board the British,
French and Italian cruisers, to some
neutral country, where they can
remain until the war Is terminated,
and thus avoid the humiliation of be
ing held prisoners in Japan, and the
American Minister, after consulting
with his Japanese confrere, has wired
his Government for instructions. \
The situation contained in this ques
tion is, indeed, one involving delicate
diplomacy. The Russian refugees are
not prisoners of war, at least, not yet.
After scuttling their ships in the har
bor of a neutral country they, escaped
to the vessels of other neutral coun
tries. The sea battle that led to their
defeat and consequent destruction of
their ships was commenced In neutral
waters and the protests of the nations
who have accepted the refugees were
ignored.
It Is claimed that the British officer
who was sent with the joint protest to
the flagship Mikasa of the Japanese
fleet failed by a few minutes to reach
the Japanese admiral before the unex
pected early' movement of the Rus
sian vessels precipitated firing. All
circumstances considered, it is . be
lieved that Japan will agree to the re
moval of the unfortunate Russian
refugees to a neutral port, under dis
tinct assurances that they will not
be permitted to again* take up arms
during the present conflict.'
It is good for Korea that it is so, for
a more oppressed, downtrodden people
does not exist on the face of the earth.
Nevertheless it will be a work of time,
care and patience to convince the peo
ple that their rulers will no longer be
able to "squeeze" them and that they
may develop prosperity by their own
Industry.
QUESTION OF REFUGEES.
All this within six days from the date
that Japan announced that she would
adopt her own course without further
consultation with Russia if that coun
try continued her policy of refusing to
withdraw from Manchuria and of de
clining to consider the claims advanced
by Japan concerning Korea, But a few
days ago the influence of the Russian
Minister was all powerful at the Rus
sian court, and when his Japanese col
league requested 'an imperial audience
he was Informed that his Majesty was
indisposed.
Ever since the assassination of the
former Queen of Korea, on October 8,
1895, the Emperor of Korea, his govern
ment and the Korean people generally
have mistrusted the Japanese, and his
Majesty has placed reliance on the
pledges offered him by Russia.
Suddenly a body of troops arrived at
Seoul, and the Japanese Minister, with
out deigning to consult the trembling
Korean monarch, suggests that Korea
does not need advice nor assistance
from Russia any longer, and her Min
ister has no other choice than to obey.
Already the Emperor of Korea is
pleading for forgiveness and offering
assurances of better government in fu
ture; but whether Russia is able to re
assert her power with the Korean gov
ernment or not, Kprea's days of com
plete independence have been number
ed and the full number counted.
ONE WEEK'S CHANGES.
The effect upon his Majesty and the
higher Korean official circles of the
Russian naval reverses of the last few
days and the prompt observance of thÂ«
demand of the Japanese Minister, M.
Hayashi, for the withdrawal of M. Pav
lov and his countrymen from the Ko
rean capital can hardly be overesti
mated. The Korean officials who are
known to be of the Russian party at
the capital, and who have been work
ing with M. Pavlov for the further
ance of his plans regarding the future
of Korea, are hiding in fear and trem
bling. Some have fled from the city
and others dare not show themselves
for fear of Japanese reprisals, now that
they hold the balance of power.
There were no visible signs of dis
composure among the Russian party as
it embarked to-day, but a general air
of sadness hung over it and the friends
who had come to say good-by. The
farewells were short and hurriedly
spoken, as though all were anxious to
have an unpleasant though unavoid
able task quickly over with. And the
question that was uppermost In the
minds of all was, "When and under
what auspices will the departing ones
i-eturn?
The impossible has occurred. The
representative of one power has or
dered the representative of another
power to leave, with all his country
men, from the capital of an independ
ent neutral country, one over which
neither of the powers in question is
internationally supposed to possess an
atom of control. With the withdrawal
of M. Pavlov to-day the Russian flag
has disappeared from Korean soil, and
Its return will be one of the Important
milestones in Oriental history.
KOREANS ARE OVERAWED.
and departures from Korea have al
ways heretofore been events of note
in Korean official circles. They were
always present bearing gifts \f or the
Minister and his family and a special
deputation from his Majesty, the Em
peror, was always conspicuous. To
day's departure was in marked con
trast and is indicative of the ebb of
Russian Influence at the Korean Court.

JNO. J. FULTON CO.
On his visit to this city last fall Mr. Han-
num was not extra well and procured a bottle
of Fulton's 'Compound to have with him In
ease of an emergency. Not feeling the need ot
It on his return to Ennls, he gave It to. the pa-
tient mentioned I above. ' Even then he would
not take It, feeling certain that nothing could
be done for him.
Mr. Hannum now sends back home the de-
tails of the Interesting denouement.' The pa-
tient finally got eo badly off that his life was
despaired of, and the end was looked for dally.
He could not get his breath and was In the
smothering condition that comes toward the
lust and had to be propped up in bed with pil-
lows In order to breathe. His condition be-
came so extreme that his physician was unable
to aid him cr offer any hope, and he then re-
sorted to the bottle left by Mr. Hannum..
In a short time be was resting and breathing
easier, and he continued to Improve till Â¦ at
last account he had made such fine progress
that he drove to the city himself to get further
supplies of the Compound, his only concern
being that there might be none of it at. hand.
As a matter of fact there was none in Ennls
and they had to send to Fort . Worth for It.
This seeming miracle created great Interest,
and. the physician in the case, who was an In-
terested observer, told Mr. Hannum he would
hereafter use the Compound In his practice.
Mrs. Hannum gave.ua these facts, . and they
can be relied upon.

will be sent free to any address.
"I recommend 'Pyramids' wherever
I know of any one suffering as I did.
It sivrs me pleasure to be able
to say I am entirely cured, which my
doctor say? is true. I pay God bless
Pyramid Pile Cure." From a former

Unity street. Frankford, Philadel-
phia. Pa.
This remedy, which is sold by drugr-
grists generally, in 50 cent and dollar
packages, is in a suppository form, is
applied directly to the parts affected
and performs its work quietly and
j;ainlcssiy. Its value is evidenced by
the testimony given above, and we
ursr<? all sufferers to buy a package
Knotr the Value of Pyramid Pile Cure.
"Gratitude alone prompts me to tes-
tify to the efficacy of Pyramid Pile
Cure. Last March I bought a dollar
package at the drug store, which cured
me of bleeding piles, and I was a suf-
ferer from them for eight years; but
I had not been troubled with them
Fince. until last September, when I
ps-ve birth to a baby girl, and after
that I had a very severe case of pro-
truding piles, which a trained nurse
paid was the worst case she ever saw,
and my doctor told me to get Pyra-
mid PI1Â«? Cure again, which I did, and
was completely cured in three days.
I have not had piles of any kind since,
and it is all owing to this wonderful
remedy. My nurse took a box, which
I w.is Kiad to be able to srive her. for I
know jÂ«h<? will be able to help lots of
suffering people whom I could never
hop or know.

It became very evident this afternoon
that there was going to be trouble be
tween the two classes if the majority
of the members of those classes could
bring it about. The proressors had
threatened expulsion and the classes
had passed resolutions against rushing,
but in spite of all this the freshmen
went up on the hill this afternoon and
dug the trench for the gigantic figures
of their class, '07, preparatory to filling
the trench with lime. The programme
was that a fire was to be built as a
challenge, and then the sophomores
were to rush the hill. When this was
learned Professor Corey appealed to
the Oakland and San Francisco police
departments for men and Policemen
Ford, Ahern and Gunther were sent
from Oakland in full uniform. They
were stationed with the San Francisco
men . uppn the hillside, with instruc
tions to stop any ruBh. â¢
The sophomore class formed in
Berkeley and finally went to Shattuck
Hall. to^ keep out of the wet while
awaiting the signal. There its mem
bers told stories and enjoyed refresh
ments, but at a late hour nothing had
been heard from the freshman class.
A squad of policemen, three from
Oakland and several from San Fran
cisco, is guarding the hill back of the
State University in a pouring rain to
night- in order to prevent a rush. Up
to midnight there were no traces of the
freshmen class, while the sophomore
class was in full force in Shattuck
Hall, holding a smoker ajj^j waiting for
the challenge it expected from the
freshmen.

' "The State universities, have' .made
m6re progress in 'broadening" the sdope
of the scientific colleges than the en
dowed universities. This is simply be
cause the. State institutions have more
money. ' The\ endowed institution
usually must wait until some ..-one
makes a gift for some specific pur
pose. If the State institution want?
anything the authorities appeal indi
rectly to the people and eventually
their requests are complied with.
"It does not seem that people at
tach so much importance to the old
classic course that included Greece and
Latin as they formerly did. Per
sonally I am for the old classic course.
But. as I said, young men go to the
university to fit themselves for the
'struggle with the world and the future
and sc they incline toward the scien
tific colleges."
Owing to the inclemency of the
weather President "Wheeler announced
to-day that the Charter day exercises
would be held in Harmon gymnasium
instead of the Greek theater as had
been planned.
Only in a general way would Presi
dent Angell discuss the ways of uni
versities. Upon the ways of state, the
ways of foreign war and the wavs of
politics he knew nothing for publica
tion, but what he did say about the
universities exhibited the good, solid,
common sense thinker â not of the
theorist, the idealist. That there is
good in all institutions, State or en
dowed, expresses in a general way_
President Angell's views, and it all
amounts in the end to progress. In a
word, he Is an optimist.
"The University of California enjoys
a very good reputation in the East,"
he paid. "It is everywhere favorably
known. The engagement of Professor
Jacques Loeb gave the university some
prominence. It was a distinct loss to
Chicago when he left that university.
."In a general way California and
Michigan universities are very much
alike) There is really no difference,
for j Uiat matter. In the methbds of
conducting any university "supported
by the State. I take it that the State
university Â¦Â¦ Authorities try to provide
the students* with just what the people
Lof the r 'State wish "/.them .provided, j
': /'And I think that 'this accounts for
the development of the scientific col-
Wges in thâ¬ State universities. ] , They
are.ijjolng. in ;for..the mpre practical
things. For there will always be more
students in the department tbat.will
provide an immediate livelihood after
graduation than from those" that'lrim
only to give culture. . It is essentially
the duties of "the ; " Universities to : "fit
their students fbr.llfe.Â» *--;,;; t. i;
President Angell betrays little of
the fifty years of wear and tear of ac
tivity In his personality. He is hale
and ruddv and active.
but it demands some sort of re
search and study, and not even a uni
versity president may dash off 10,000
words without pausing.
"I'm going- to tell what I think
about "The Type of the State Uni
versity,' " said President Angell. "It's
going to.be short, too, because I don't
believe the people want to hear much
on a subject of that kind, especially if
it rains."
Many enthusiastic evangelists attend- :
ed the closing session of the Interde
nominational Conference c-n Evangelism
at the Union-street Presbyterian Church
this evening. The first session this
mtrrning was devoted to a discussion of
practical evangelistic methods by the
Rev. E. R. Dille, pastor of the First
M. E. Church of this city. Among the
other speakers were: Rev. A. I. Good
friend. Rev. W. C. Sherman, Rev. J.
A. Fraser, Rev. W. M. White, Rev. C.
M. Hill and Rev. R. C. Stcme.
At the close of the morning session
luncheon was served in the parlors of
the church, and at 1:30 p. m. the dele
gates reassembled for a general dis
cussion of the subject of evangelistic
work, in which a large number of
prominent clergymen took part.
The feature of the evening session
was a description by Rev. H. W.
Houlding of the many difficulties that
confront the Christian missionary In
China. Horace W. Houlding has re
cently returned from a missionary sta
tion In Northern China, and Ms dis
course this evening was most enter
taining. ' After, describing the work in
detail Mr. Houlding said:
"Many of those, interested in mis
sionary work make the mistake of at
tempting to urge faint-hearted people
to take up missionary work, when they
should rather hold them back. If the
Lord elects that one of his children
shal^ go forth into the field no urging
will be necessary nor will there be

McCoy, a prominent musician, who
rescued the young woman while her
garments were in flames.
Miss Cronan was drying clothes in
the basement of the Corder residence.
A floor joist caught fire near a stove
pipe. While trying to extinguish the
blaze the servant girl's dress "caught
afire. With screams for help she ran
out of the basement Into the yard.
Her cries attracted the attention of
the three men. who were paÂ«engers
on an electric car bound downtown.
They ran, to the resxme and quickly
had the blazing garments smothered
at some risk to themselves. The girl's
hands were severely burned, but she
escaped serious if not fatal injury.
The fire department responded to
a call and the flames in the basement
were extinguished with little damage.

ibe man's life. Near the bed was a vial
that had contained carbolic . acid, and
there was external evidence that
Blouin hail drunSt the fluid.'

ly-five years. Recently forjune desert

The club members met in the parlors
of the First Presbyterian Church and
at the appointed time marched in twos
to the rear entrance of the theater,
where they took a space , allotted to
them. Although the rain was coming
down in torrents, they marched in un
broken ranks and filled the stage with
representative business men of the city.
The figure of a '.'knocker" was carried
upon a bier by four pallbearers and was
cast into a trapdoor opening leading
to the under world.
The demonstration was one of the
most successful held in connection with
the bond election movement. At each
meeting of the Boosters' Club its en
rollment is being increased, until it is
thought in a few weeks more it will
number 1000. . Its purpose is to work
for the passage of the bond election to
be called shortly.
A unique demonstration in the rnove-%
merit toward voting bonds for the beau
tifying of the city and the consolida
tion of Oakland, Berkeley and Ala

by the Boosters' Club to-night, when,
a hundred strong and under the lead
ership of A. Dodge Coplin, the club
marched into the Liberty Theater Just
before the last curtain was runs down
on the play of "Barbara Frietchie," and
by arrangement took possession of the
house and presented to the audience
H, C. Capwell and Councilman A. H.
Elliott, each of whom spoke for. a few
minutes uDon the subject of voting

The City Council and the Board of
Health have two decidedly different
ideas upon the question of a pesthouse
for the city. The Council is desirous of
locating upon a tract of land donated
to the city by 'the Realty Syndicate, on
the banks of the tidal canal in Fruit
vale, while the F.oard of Health wants
to secure possession of the residence of
Daniel S. Richardson, formerly Assist
ant Postmaster of San Francisco, who
lived in Highland Park. But while
these two municipal bodies differ as to
location, both are agreed upon the
necessity of a pesthouse, or hospital,
for contagious diseases. It is now
costing the city $10,000 a year to handle
cases of this kind, the municipality
being compelled to pay for guards
where they quarantine a house. The
bill for guards alone amounts to an
average of $7000 a year.
It was this item that staggered some
of the hardheaded practical business
men of thf present Council, who could
not see the necessity of paying this
amount out each year, particularly
when it fell to a few political retainers.
The result was that they decided at
once upon a pesthouse.
But the location was the cause of
trouble. Whenever it was proposed
to purchase a site, the residents In the
neighborhood made vigorous protest,
and it looked as if the whole matter
would be checked.
Then the Realty Syndicate agreed to
donate a site on the banks of the Tidal
canal in Fruitvale, and the Council
stood willing to appropriate money for
the buildings. There were no residents
in the neighborhood to protest, and it
looked for a while as if the question
was settled. Then the Board of Health
objected and produced an offer for the
sale of the Richardson home in High
land Park. But the Council did not
take kindly to this site, upon the
ground that it would have to pay for
a site and a few buildings as much
money as they had at their disposal.
The Board of Health secured from
City Attorney McElroy an opinion
that it could legally be empowered to
spend the money, and upon that opin
ion it asked Â«the Council to ttfrn over
to it the $10,000 that had been set aside
for that purpose. But the Council has
taken the matter into its own hands
and has decided to turn over to the
Board of Public Works the power to
build the new hospital. If the Board
of Public Works, and not the Board of
Health, handles the money, the site on
the banks of the tidal canal will be
taken.
FOR3IER SECRETARY

Hushes' Will Filed for Probate.
The will of Rienzi Hughes, the
lodging-house proprietor, who died a
few days ago, was filed for probate

ow, Mary Hughes, when it is to bÂ»

Judge Samuels Finds No Criminal In
tent In Sale of Interest in
Mortgaged Stable.
OAKLAND, March 22. â R. F. Jack
son, former secretary of the Board of
Public Works, was discharged to-day
by Police Judge George Samuels after
the preliminary examination on a
charge of fraud in the sale of an in
terest in a Telegraph-avenue stable to
James Van Schaack had been held.
It was claimed that Jackson, con
trary to the law. had failed to tell *he
purchaser that there was a mortgage
on the stable. The defense was that
Jackson- had shown no criminal intent
and the court took that view of the
transaction.
Poses as Colonel in Army.
Abe Becker of the Fawn saloon, 326
Grant avenue, obtained a warrant
\ from Police Judge Cabaniss yesterday
for the arrest of Thomas R. Scott on a
charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses. Becker alleges that Scott
has been cutting a wide swath in the
saloons in the "tenderloin" district by
representing himself as a colonel in
j the army and giving worthless checks
in payment for liquid refreshments.
Becker got a check from him for $25
on the "Western National Bank and
) was informed that Scott's account at
j the bank had been closed for over two
I months.

CALLS TO GIVE FRENCH
LESSON AND DROPS DEAD
Mrs. Marie A. Perrier Dies Suddenly
Â¦ in the GouglJ- Street Residence of
Mrs. Abraham Rosenberg.
Mrs. Marie A. Perrler, "a teacher of
French, died suddenly yesterday af
ternoon in the residence of Mrs. Ab
raham Rosenberg 1 , 1810 Gough street.
The deceased, who resided at the Ho
tel, Bradbury, 1604 California street,
called upon Mrs. Rosenberg to com
plete arrangements to grive her French
lessons. \
Upon entering the house she was
conducted to'the parlor, and complain
ed of feeling faint. She sank exhaust
ed upon a divan and Dr. Terry was
summoned. Before his arrival death
occurred and j the Coroner's office" was
notified. The body was removed ; to
the Morgue by Deputy Coroner Mike
Browni Heart failure undoubtedly
\vas the cause of death, as the dead
woman had not complained of any
illness prior to leaving the hotel , In
which she resided. ,
Madame Perrier was about 65 years
of age and had been an instructor of
French in many of the * most promi
nent families in this : city. : A grand
son, employed by, the. Pioneer ,Auto

of the deceased here..
Later, when another official -was on
watch, who did not' understand that a
man was wanted, one drove to the line
.and went across. The official was able
to give only a partial description of
the man. but it tallies with the print
ed description received to-night from
Sheriff Ralphs. The rurales have been
sent after the stranger and he will be
overhauled to-morrow and given an
opportunity to explain his presence in
that country.

allowed to drop here, as the committee

Rev. D. O. Kelly pronounced the
benediction at the conclusion of Mr.
Macarthur's remarks. To-day, at the
same time and place, Rev. Frederick
W. Clampett, D. D., rector of Trinity
Church, will speak on "Righteous
Citizenship in Public Spirit."
The solution of the labor problem depends
upon getting the right perspective and the
acceptance of the spirit of reciprocity. The
labor problem- cannot be solved on purely
economic grounds, hut must be solved on
ethlral or religious grounds. We know that
In the parly days the struggle of the workers
was primarily agralnct the pagan conception of
labor, which relegated the man who worked
to the cattle of the fields. We know that- it
was Christ the Savior, Christ the carpenter,
who first Instilled man with the knowledge
that all men arc equal in the sight of God.
It Is under the lpadershlp of Christ the Savior
that we shall ultimately solve the labor prob-
Irm. Those who are acquainted with the
labor movement; know '. that it la primarily,
fundamentally and essentially vti religious
movement. We take the- work .of the savior
as our guide In our efforts to bring about
amicable. Just and permanent relations be
tween employer and employe.
In the difficulties that are surrounding us
neither factor is blameless or blameworthy:
neither can Â¦ pay that hie side has been all
right and the other side all wrong; error has
been committed on both tildes, on the side of
the employe in his organized capacity and on
the side of the employer in his organized
capacity. .
SOLUTION* OF PROBLEM.
To the man of righteousness and righteous
character, who takes a sane and rational view
of the labor problem, the outlook is bright.
The problem is simply a question of fair play.
With fair play the problem of labor melts and
disappears; it Is no problem at all.
Macarthur's subject was "Righteous
Citizenship in the Shop." He said in
part:
We Â«haJl be doing no violence' to the sub
ject nor taking liberties with it if it is trans
lated to read, '\Kighteousnes3 in the Relations
of Labor." As It is true that by labor alone
do we live, it is true that just ajÂ» the con
ditions under which labor Is performed are
righteous or unrlehteouy. so must be all con
ditions of life. I use the term labor In no
narrow sense, not as a class term, but as a
generic term, implying all riEht methods by
which men derive sustenance from the earth
Labor is a fundamental condition of life, if
righteousness In all the avenues of lite is to
be achieved It is by the righteous relations In
labor. The future is bound up in the solu
tion of the question of labor. To the man
of unrighteousness, governed by the narrow
spirit of selfishness, by narrow ideals, the
future of labor is indeed dark. We find men
of that character arrayed against the laborer,
seeking tp deny to him the poor boon of or
ganization â the privilege won by the employe
through centuries of struggleâ the right which
the employe holds by the universal law of
.nature. We find the narrow employer seeking
to destroy the organization of labor under the
Fpecious guise of the "open shop." The aim
of the "open shop" employer ls.to have the
shop open only to the elements that would
destroy the organizations of labor. There la
nothing to be gained by treating labor that
! way.
jAB0R A CONDITION.
Walter Macarthur, editor of the
Coast Seaman's Journal and one of the
labor leaders of this city, delivered the
address at the second of the series of
i:6onday Lenten services, conducted by
the Brotherhood of St. Andrew in the
rooms of the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce yesterday. Every avail
able seat in the rooms was occupied,
and many were compelled to remain
standing during the services. Although
in the larger cities of the United States
noonday Lenten services have been in
vogue for many years, they are al
ways held in one of the churches.
This is the only city where religious
worship is conducted during the peni
tential season in the commercial dis
trict, so that the busy man of affairs
is afforded an opportunity to attend
without losing time from his business.
The services were conducted by F. T.
Foster and followed the usual order.
The lesson was taken from St. Mark,
6:1-6. Mr. Macarthur's address was
a brilliant effort, and his remarks on
the righteous relations that should ex
ist between capital and labor were
most timely. He maintained that the
only solution of the labor problem was
through religion. *

RIVERSIDE. March 22.â The doors of
the Orange Growers' National Bank
of this city, one of the principal finan
cial institutions of Riverside County,
were closed shortly after 1 o'clock this
Rfternoon, after a run of three hours.
H. T. Hays, former cashier of the bank
nnd one of the most prominent men
in the social and business life of this
city, has fled, presumably toward the
Mexican border, and the Sheriff is on
his trail with a warrant for his arrest.
There is a shortage of between $90,000
and $105,000 In the funds x>f the bank,
and it is alleged that this sum was
appropriated by Hays during his tenure
as cashier. President Gaylor Rouse of
the Orange Growers' National Bank
authorizes the statement that deposit
ors will receive every dollar that is
due them, but that in order to prepare
for a liquidation of all the liabilities
Â«*f the institution the directors, after
r meeting this morning, decided to close
thp doors and take an inventory of the
assets.
Several months ago H. T. Hays was
requested by the directors of the Or-
Rrge Growers' National Bank to re
sign on account of his alleged connec
tion with frauds in securing right of
way titles for the Salt Lake Railroad
in Riverside County. Hays acted as
local land agent for the Salt Lake Rail
road, and when an expose was made
r.f the methods used in securing rights
<>f nay In this county there was a big
ynsaticn. and Hays was asked to re
sign his position as cashier. Some time
t-:;bs:equent to his resignation Hays was
a^ked to make good a shortage of
?r.fi(%n, with which request, according to
bank officials, he complied. Later a
further shortage of $1300 was discov
Â«=r<v5. and this also was made good by
Hay*. A further Investigation of his
su-counts developed a shortage of $18,000,
which he was asked to pay. He could
net do so, but gave security instead
in thp form of a trust deed to his prop
*rt y.
About ten days ago the National
Kank Examiner arrived here to expert
the books of the bank. He soon un
covered a large shortage, unofficially
estimated at $100,000. The officials of
the bank then decided to prosecute
Hays, but deferred action until last
right. Hays learned of their intentions
and disappeared. It is said he drove
in a buggy south toward the Mexican
border. A warrant is in the hands of
Sheriff Corbun and officers are on hia
trail.
Depositors got some intimation of the
hank's troubles and this morning a long
line of people stood in front of the
doors, waiting to draw out their de
posits. Between $80,000 and $90,000 was
paid out before notice of suspension
was posted.
The bark's directorate is composed of
well known and prominent citizens of
this county and it is believed depositors
will be paid In full.

Dispatch. A. H. Naftzger and E. S.
Mculton looked after the interests of
the California Fruit Agency. The fruit
men issued a statement after the con
ference detailing the matters consid
ered and ending with the following dec
laration: /
"Every question bearing upon the
matters' in hand was fully and freely
discussed, with the result that the peti
tion for a reduction was denied by the
railroads upon the ground that they
could not afford to haul oranges for a
less rate than that now prevailing, viz.,
$1 25 per 100 pounds.
LOS ANGELES. March 22.â The con
ference held in this city to-day be
tween representatives of the Southern
Pacific and the Santa Fe railroads and
those of, the California Fruit Agency
ended at a late hour this evening with
out definite results. The fruit men
asked for a reduction of 25 cents per
hundred pounds in the rate on oranges
"from Southern California to Eastern
markets, which th.e railroads declare
they cannot grant. The present rate
is $1 25 per hundred. pounds, and the
Â¦erange ' men assert that they cannot
pay it and make a living in the fruit
business. The matter rests where it
was before th^ conference, although the
fruit men declare th'ey have not done
with the subject of rates and will con
tinue their fight for a lower'rate.
The snowfall bulletin just issued by
the Department of Agriculture shows
that the precipitation in California i3
a trifle above the average.
The barometer fell slowly yesterday
afternoon and a southeaster was rais
ing big waves outside the heads at
nightfall. Storm warnings were sent
out broadcast by the . Weather Bu
reau. Professor McAdie says that the
weather for the last three weeks is of
extraordinary interest to meteorolog
ical students.
The worst feature of yesterday's
storm was the volume of water it put
into the rivers. The Yuba. Sacramen
to,, Bear, Feather and American riv
ers are all running bankfull as it is
and when these streams get the new
flood to-day the result is likely to be
disastrous, according to McAdie. The
weather -was warm enough to melt
the snow In the mountains yesterday
as well. Detrition has already weak
ened the levees in many places. The
Weather Bureau predicts more rain
for to-day for the whole of California.
* It has rained eighteen days out of
the last twenty-two and more wet
weather may be expected. Incidental
ly the record for the number of rainy
days in March has been broken.
The rainfall is 4.21 inches for the
month thus far. The precipitation in
March, 1879. was 8.75 inches; in
March, 1889, 7.78 and in
March, 1899, 7.68 inches. The great
est average rainfall for any one month
was in January, 1862, when the pre
cipitation was 24,26 inches. Last Feb
ruary at Bowmans Dam in Nevada
County the rainfall amounted to mor$
than 46 inches. The seasonal rainfall
is about normal this year.
Rain Falls Eighteen Days Out of
Twenty-Two.
SAN DIEGO. March 22.â After sev
eral light showers during the afternoon
and evening, rain began to fall steadily
at 10 o'clock to-night.
FRESNO, .March 22.â Fresno was
again blessed with a good rain to-day.
Nearly the whole day long the rain
has come down steadily, and at times
the downpour has been very violent.
The streets are filled with water and
things are wetter than ever before this
season. Many smiles can be seen on
the streets as the.farmers of the com
munity think of their crops and the
good that the rain will do them. Up to
8 o'clock this evening it has rained .78
of an inch and the storm is not yet
over. The prospects for the county are
brightening with the March showers.
SAN JOSE, March 22.â Heavy show
ers have fallen here this afternoon and
to-night, the measurement at 11 p. m.
being .30 of an inch. Total for the sea
son 11.03 inches; last year 12.29 inches.
VALLEJO, March 22. â With the
country hereabouts already thorough
ly saturated with water a heavy rain
storm has been prevailing during the
past seven or eight hours and is rag
ing heavily to-night, i
It seems certain that much damage
will be done to railroad and other
property. Much low land in this sec
tion is flooded and the roads are almost
impassable. The rainfall for the sea
son exceeds seventeen inches.
HOLLISTER, March 22. â Hollistcr
is having a bounteous downpour. The
total rainfall is now over eight inches
at Hollister and In some parts of San
Benito County is as mufh as fifteen
inches. The orchards and alfalfa fields
are all being irrigated from the canal
with water taken from the river.

WEATHER RECORD BROKEN'.
LOS ANGELES, Match 22.â The heav
iest rainstorm of the season began in
Los Angeles at 1 o'clock this afternoon
and has continued steadily ever since.
At 10 o'clock to-night the rainfall was
very' heavy for half, an hour and the
downtown streets we're Impassable to
pedestrians. The low-lying residence
section of the city, will probably suffer
damage from the flood waters if the
rainfall continues throughout the night.
Street cars on many lines are expe
riencing .much difficulty in making
their way over their routes. The rain
was not much needed at this time, but
will insure crops of every description.
Reports from other points in Southern
California tell of a heavy rainfall.
On the night of the murder Singleton
entered the saloon of Benjamin Bros.,
corner of First and Market streets, in
this city. In. the place was Bojorgues,
Joe Patron, John Higgins and Joe Ben
jamin. Singleton had been drinking.
He sat down at the table, and taking
a large revolver from his pocket placed
it on the table. SInffleton imagined the
others present at the bar were talking
about him. When Bojorgues tried to
explain they were not. Singleton shot
him in the neck, death resulting in
stantly. Singleton then i drew a big
dirk knife. Joe Patron, a cousin of the
deceased, jumped on Singleton and
gave him a good beating. The murder
er then ran home, and a half hour later
when the police arrested him he was
asleep in bed.
Singleton, who was the only witness
for the defense, took the stand in his
own behalf. He said that when he en
tered the saloon he removed the revol
ver from his pocket and placed it on
the table because he could not sit down
with it in his pocket. He had gone
there to meet Charlie Desimone. He
said those in the saloon were friends
of his. Benjamin asked him to place
his gun in his pocket, and he said he
could not. Bojorgues then came over
where he was and attempted to take
the pistol. Singleton declared that while
they both had hold of the weapon it
was accidentally discharged. On cross
examination he stuck to his story of the
killing being accidental. This is the
first time Singleton has spoken of the
killing, his mouth having been sealed
to the police and reporters. His mother
and sister were present in court and
wept while he related the story.
Rebuttal testimony was Introduced
showing that it was almost impossible
for Bojorgues* to have been shotJin the
manner stated by Singleton.
Argument will commence in the
morning and the case will probably go
to the jury to-morrow night.
SAN JOSE, March 22.â Accidental
killing is the defense urged by William
J. Singleton, the surveyor who is on
trial for the murder of Simon Bojor-
Rues on the night of November 29 last.
To-day the defendant went on the
stand and testified that what had every
appearance of a cold-blooded crime was
merely an accident.

" WENDS â Subscribers. Alameda.
CaL Wends is a name gtven by the
Germans to roving or wandering
tribes of a branch of the Slavs, which
as early as the sixth century occu
pied the north and east ot Germany,
from the Elbe, along the coast of the
Baltic, to the Vistula, and as far south
as Bohemia. In a narrower sense the
name Wend Is given to those remnants
of the Slavic population of Lusatia
who still speak- the Wendic tongue
and preserve the peculiar Wendic
manners and customs.
Of late our courts appear to have become privileged
ground for the publication of unwarranted and outra
geous slanders upon innocent persons that, under the
law,: have no: redress. There should .be some statute
providing for "the infliction of severe penalties upon at
torneys that use the courts for the promulgation of
statements they cannot; prove. Liberty is spilled license
by too many lawyers.
When the pupil has in this way be
come familiar -with the outlines of .the
live* of the most well known musi
cians buy a book In which their biog
raphies are ffi ven and read it aloud
Htudy up the lives of the musicians
and some rainy day take the child
on your lap and in your own language
tell him the story of one of them,
simply and entertainingly. Avoid
dates and leave out the dry parts of
the biography, if any there be, telling
the boy such things as will best stay
in his mind and. give him a vivid pic
ture of the musician in question. If
one has the knack of story telling
these little histories can be made as
interesting: to children as fajry sto
ries.
Do not be in a hurry to turn from
one Btory to another. Tell the story
over and over again 'on different days
and eometimesget the' child to repeat
(o you all that he can remember of it.
This will help to fix it firmly Jn his
mind and pave the way for the next
story.

HAND AT TOP OFPAGE.
A French student, medically inclined in the enuncia
tion of his theories, expresses the opinion that war is a
disease in which the death-giving germ may be discov
ered and . destroyed if science will only give itself pa
tiently and courageously to the task. As a contribution
to the discussion from a layman please accept the sug
gestion that' the easiest way and perhaps the only one
to ' kill the germ is to destroy humanity. Men being
rational must fight with one another.
A few weeks ago England was
startled by the news that a laborer,
going to work at 3 in the morning, was
literally swallowed into the earth in a
Cheshire ' town. As It was Impossible
to recover the body, funeral services
were held over the spot where he dis
appeared, and It took eighty tons of
earth to fill up the hole.
Now alarming reports are coming
from Northwich, another little pretty
Cheshire town, where many of the
houses are sinking into the ground.
Up to this time there has been no loss
of life at Northwich; but the damage
to the property has been jio tremen
dous that the town Is a practical non
entity, so far as land values are con
cerned. Since the town began to sub
side property valued previously at $1,
659.425 has deteriorated to $514,743, and
the annual loss from these causes is
more than $25,000. Seven years ago
Northwich built a 510,000 police station.
To-day, building is an abandoned
shell, the foundations of which have
long ago sunk into the ear A to a
depth of some 130 feet.

COMPOSERS â Subscriber. Pacific
Grove, Cal. It is impossible to
give a general answer to tne
Question, "Who were the five
best musical composers?" for the
reason that there Li no standard for
arriving at a determination. Music
is a matter of individual taste and
Â¦w hat pleases one displeases another.
State Chemist Walker of Nebraska,
after spending several weeks in anal
yzing tomato catsup and strawberry
jam Btates that only one brand of cat
sup was found which was made from
tomatoes and was not artificially col
ored. Pumpkin was found to form the
basis of all the others, and the col
oring is attained by means of coal tar
dyes. Alleged strawberry Jam in a
number of case3 he found was made
chiefly of pumpkin, colored with coal
tar dyes and containing a preservative
in the form of benzole. Timothy seed
was also found to be an Ingredient in
some cases.. \; V

WOOD FIRE â A. S. B.. City. The
various colors in flame in a wood fir?
are caused by the combustion of thÂ«
elements of the fueL The light blue ia
from hydrogen, the white from car
bon, the violet from ma.nga.nese. the
red from magnesia and the yellow
from soda.
The close proximity of the half tones
makes it necessary for the pupil to
strike a carefulW direct blow at the
very center of the note in order to keep
the fingers from Interfering- with each
other. ; ,
In practicing this exercise the boy
uses more strength than' he has ever
put into an exercise before, and there
fore he must be careful to keep arms
and wrists free.
Systematic relaxation is the safest
plan in this exercise, and I would ad
vise the pupil to relax entirely and to
try his "circle exercise" (explained fully
â¢In the earlier lessons) at" the end of
each ascent or descent during the pro
gress of the study. This will leave him
fresh for each attack and will prevent
him from becoming the victim to nny
.possible strain which might be engen
dered ; by the strenuous and unusual
work a study of this exercise Involves.
The student must never \ work j very
long at this on a stretch. It is a good
plan to practice it, or a part of it, for
a few minutes after^orklng on light,
airy music. It is best always when do-
Ing a great deal of heavy piano work
to intersperse JL_with music containing
delicate, graceful passages.
After, haying .finished this form of
the eieretee'the'papll 6hould try It in
another way, beginning with the sec
ond finger, instead of the thumb, and
using this finger to come back to each
time. This will bring the fifth finger
on the final note 'of course. The left
hand must now begin with the fourth
finger, finishing the exercise with the
thumb, instead of the second finger
as heretofore. v :^ <
Coming down the scale the opposite
rules are observÂ«d, as usual.
Jn this way all the finge'rs have an
equal chance at the strengthening
process.
the plan of action described above, the
left hand is doing exactly the oppo
*fyz 'thing.-r That., is to say, the left
feantrbegins with; the* little" (fifth)-fln
gerÂ»?an<l while playing. the same. notes
as thosâ¬ played in the right hand, uses
the "fifth ' finger, fourth, fifth, third,
fifth, second, and bo on up the scale,
while the right hand is working with
first, second, third and fourth fingers.
In descending the scÂ«le the left hand
naturally begins with the first finger,
ueing next the second, first, third, first
and fourth, as the right hand did in
ascending. .--.â¢'"

WE are glad that the Board of Health in Hawaii
is holding up foodstuffs, imported from Califor
nia, that arc impure and fraudulent. Jellies and
jams are found by the chemist to be sophisticated, in # ;
that there are no currants in the currant jelly and no '
berries in the berry jam, and that both are colored with !
coal tar dyes; These dyes carry zinc, copper, tin and j
arsenic, none of 'which chemicals are freely chosen by j
the people as a proper part of the diet. They are high- I
ly injurious, to the health, and their use in commercial!
products can be punished, if in no other way, by the con- j
demnation and destruction of the articles in which thej f I
are used.
â¢The loss from-, such commercial dishonor runs back to
the grower of the fruits which should be used in these
manufactured products. Currants and berries are pro
duced here in quantities more than sufficient for all the
jellies and jams called for by our domestic and foreign
trade. If they alone were used the articles would be
wholesome and of such high character as to extend the
consumption. Such extension would go back . to the
grower in the form of a proper return for his industry.
But the manufacturers make jelly out 'of gelatine, treated,
with mineral acids and colored with mineral dyes, and
jams out of dried apples and glucose, with a few berry
seeds, snubbing the currants and berries which we pro
duce in excellence and abundance, and betraying the
confidence and injuring the health of the consumer.
It is an injurious trick of the trade. California can
supply the world with these fruit products, in absolute
purity, but will lose that trade and opportunity by vio
lating the principles of commercial honor. There is no
plea to sustain this offense against the prosperity of the
State and the health of the people. It will not do to say
that our currants and berries will not make commercial
jellies and jams, for every housewife' knows better. It is
no excuse to say that these injurious arts are, practiced
by foreign competitors, who must be met in the markets
with equal craft and as bad drugs. The true way to com
pete is to establish the reputation of California products
for purity and excellence, when they will be' preferred
to the impure and poisonous article. Buyers and con
sumers are not so foolish as to take poison because it is
The Treasury Department is exerting every energy
to prevent the importation of impure foodstuffs. All of
its work will be thrown away if it prove to be only for
the purpose of shutting out foreign adulterations in order
that our people may be poisoned by the domestic sophjs
ticator. It is a question of such large importance as to
induce a keen interest in the food show by the grocers
jn this city. If publicity and law can restrain these adul
terations, both should be invoked.

There appears to be little question that British mili
tary experts are giving advice to the Japanese in refer
ence to the conduct of their land campaign. Whether
or not the advice is voluntary or solicited is not known,
but of one important fact there can be no doubt. The
Japanese certainly are familiar with the South African
war and hardly want to imitate the tactics of the British
displayed in that conflict.

quasi public nature of their property. But later on, in
the sixties, they resisted public regulation on the ground
that it was not provided for in their charters and fran
chises, and that these constituted an inviolable vested
right. In this view they were supported by the decision
of the Supreme Court in the Dartmouth College case.
That doctrine was finally overthrown and reversed in
the Granger cases, because railroad property had become
quasi public, through the use of the, power to condemn
private property for its purposes.
This opened tip the whole question of public regula
tion and the method of its exercise. The States pro
ceeded to exercise it by the use of legislative and execu
tive power. When this issue arose it was discovered
that a change had been made in the Federal constitution !
by the fourteenth amendment, which became operative i
July 28. 1868, and provided this: "Nor shall any State
deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without
due process of law." As the power to fix railroad rates
is the power to take property from one for the benefit of
another, and affects both the shipper who pays his
money, his property, for transportation, and the railroad
company, in whose quasi public character there remains
an element of private property, it became important to
know the meaning of due process of law. One school of
reasoners held that it was the legislative and executive
process, another that it was the judicial process only.
The latter position is obviously right. Were it other-/
wise the legislative or the executive could inflict loss of
liberty or life, -without the agency of the courts.
In the Minnesota and Texas cases the judicial pro
cess was "upheld. We assume that it is this decision
which is held to have shorn the Interstate Commerce
Commission and the State Railroad Commissions of
their genuine powers. The mistake is in assuming, that
the powers "were genuine which were obnoxious to the
fourteenth amendment
. Eliminating the element of private property, co-exist
ent with the quasi public character of railroad property,
the affirmation of the judicial process as the due process
of law still stands vindicated. Therefore, no inconsist
ency appears in Justice Harlan's decision. Congress
has the same control over interstate and the States over
domestic commerce as before, but- must provide for the
exercise of such control by due process of law.
In the evolution of the system of control we will have
cither the existing appeal from executive regulation, or:
the Interstate Commerce Commission-' and State Rail
road Commissions will be made courts of first instance,
entirely judicial in their character, and their decisions
will be subject to' the same appeal. The nation and the
States retain and may exercise the same power over com
merce, and may 'legislate against combinations to.' re
strain trade by preventing competition, but the courts
have the last word. That is all, and it appears to us
perfectly plain and consistent. The power of public reg
ulation arises in the quasi public character of Â¦: the prop- ;
erty, and the right to the judicial process for protection j
in the associated element of private property.
This question was first foughl over in New Hampshire,
where it disrupted the Democratic party. The fight ex
tended westward as railroads were extended, and reached
the States west of the Mississippi in 1851. -^Railroads ac
cepted the use of condemnation and thereby accepted the
property."
An examination of the decisions, in the Minnesota and
Texas cases, discloses something quite different from
this. The courts have not treated railroads as entirely
private property, but have recognized the right o.f public
regulation. The quasi public character of railroad prop
erty is derived from the permission to railroads to use
the right of eminent domain, in the condemnation of a
The right was a burning question in American politics
more than sixty years ago. When it was demonstrated
that the construction of railways was impossible, if the
corporations had to deal with each owner of real estate
for a right of way across his land, because he could re
fuse to sell at all, and thus block the enterprise, the right
to condemn was asserted. Now one owner" of- private
property cannot condemn to his use the private property
of another. The right to* do so is a public right. Private
property may only be condemned for a public use, and
paid for at such rate as a court may find to be a just
compensation.
THE decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
the Northern Securities Company is antagonized
from an unexpected quarter. The Redding
Searchlight, known as one of the ablest organs of labor
unions in this State, discusses the decision at great
length, and, granting the premise, with conspicuous abil
ity.
The Call is not of the belief that all the wisdom or all
of the ability in journalism is to be found in the metro
politan'press. Both truth and error are propagated with
equal ability by the country press, and it influences
public opinion for right or wrong with as much power
as the city press. Therefore, we take the opinions of the
Searchlight as significant and forcible.
After declaring that the Federal courts have shorn the
Interstate Commerce Commission of the genuine pow
ers delegated to it by Congress, and that the State
courts have done the same with the State Railroad Com
missions, the Searchlight says: "This showing would
seem to effectually dispose of Justice Harlan's assertion
that the power of Congress over interstate commerce is
as complete as the power of a State over domestic com
merce, for the courts of last resort in both cases have
denied these genuine powers delegated by Congress to
the Interstate Commerce Commission and by the State
to the Railroad Commission. This gross and insur
mountable inconsistency proceeds from the constitu
tional impossibility 61 reorganizing and protecting and
ignoring and destroying at one and the same time the

up one of the now whimpering mis

"Yes, they did, too." contradicted one
of his companions in misery.
"Who was it?" inquired the sergeant.
"The 'cop' that pinched us," replied
the boy.
"Put 'em away," ordered the ofilcer.
"I guess they are not so much to blame
as their parents. We'll turn them over
to the Juvenile Court."
"Don't you know it's wrong to steal?"
interrupted the sergeant, kindly ad
dressing his mites of prisoners. "Didn't
any one ever tell you that you shouldn't
steal?" he urged.
"It's this way," explained the police
man. "These kids here got a chance
to sell the coal they stole to a water
front restaurant man. who paid them
10 cents a load. I suppose there was
100 pounds in a load, and you can figure
what the restaurant fellow made on it
by educating these little waifs to be

"We found that a great many wagon
loads had been hauled to this place
by this bunch of youngsters and, what's
worse, they did not see anything wrong

to the little boy. There are many ex
cellent books written on the subject
.2nd some of them are particularly
tilted for children.
If this idea is followed out care
fully by you. the boy will thus add
very materially to his knowledge and
a* he progresses in his piano studies j
and gradually reaches the place where j
he is able to study music by Mozart,
Mendelssohn, etc.. he will feel twice
the interest in it that he would other
wise, because he will know who the
composer was, how he used to live,
Just the struggles he had when he was
a little boy, and soon. The composer
will thus become to him a real person
instead of some abstract being: in
whom he feels no interest.
It is now time to teach the boy a
strengthening exercise, which I have
kept until these later lessons, as the
pupil needed the weeks of finger prac
tice en the earlier studies before he
could possibly be fitted for the ad
â¢\anced finger work which I am about
to explain.
The exercise that I have in mind is
one of the most Eplendid studies for ac- {
quiring strength ever invented* and is |
particularly advantageous to the j
fourth finger, which is always inclined
to be weaker than the other fingers.
The hands are to be used together,
and both begin orÂ±. C. being an octave
apart. The right hand begins with the j
thumb /first finger) striking a heavy, 1
ringing blow with all the strength the j
pupil can possibly muster, without at
the same time throwing the hand out
of position or tightening the muscles
by the effort.
As the thumb descends the next fln
gf-r risesâ Just as far as it will go, in j
accordance with the directions given
for slow gcale practice.
As the second finger descends the
thumb (first finger) rises once more, de
scending again with hammer-like preci
sion, as before. This time the third fin
ger rises instead of tbe second. After
this the first finger strikes again, and j
then the fourth. In this exercise the J
notes are struck chromatically, instead |
of according to the ordinary scale, j
That is, the thumb strikes C and the j
second finger C sharp, instead of D, as j
would be the case ordinarily. Therefore j
the exercise is played in this way: C, C
sharp, C. I>. C. D sharp. This is the end
of the first part of the exercise. i
The thumb then start!? on C sharp
and the exercise runs in the same way
as before, only half a tone higher, mak
ing the notes C sharp. D, C sharp, D
sharp, C sharp. E.
Next the thumb starts on D. and the
exercise goes on as before. This should,
be continued, after -which the return j
trip begins. '
This time the fifth finger starts the j
exercise, beginning on G. Next comes j
the fourth finger on B, then the fifth j
on C again, next the third finger on
B fiat. C once more, and then the sec
ond finger on A-
After this the fifth finger starts once
more, on B. continuing the descent ac
cording to the rules of the exercise as
aJready given.
While the right hand is following
~State a double service. He adds a family to the forces
! of rural production, and leaves a place for another me
chanic, who is added to the consumers, and in his turn is
to go out upon land. This 'process has given to many
parts of California their best. and most intelligent tillers
of the soil. In the valleys around Mount Diablo are the
homes of men who got their start as carpenters, black
smiths, teachers, hod-carriers and cabinet-makers. In
Tulare County there are many more of the same class,
and in the awakening that is going on in the Sacramento
Valley, there is room and opportunity for thousands of
them. The year book of the State Board of Trade deals
with this subject, in a statement of the wages and oppor
tunities for labor here.
The great impulse that business, *building and produc
tive industries feel in our cities is naturally attractive to
mechanics and laborers, who are the solid foundation of
all development in a State, and our efforts to get people
to come here and join us in the making of a State should
be especially directed to the putting ot our resources and
opportunities before the intelligent American mechanics
and workingmen, who have in their skill and strength
the means ot becoming land-owners and financially in
dependent citizens.
In that way the States of the upper Mississippi Valley
were settled. In every farming neighborhood there
could be found mechanics of all kinds, whose skill at
some trade stood them in good stead in their farm life.
It must not be taken for granted that only farmers in the
East are to be looked to as the source of our rural immi
gration. Farming communities there contribute to it,
when land-owners find other farmers to whom to sell.
But we must look alÂ«o among those who want to be
land-owners, and who can come here and by tiieir work
acquire the means- to achieve their. wish. At St. Louis
we should make this feature prominent and strive to in
terest the handicraftsmen of the congested districts of
the East. When convinced that they can come here
and more quickly achieve independence than elsewhere,
that class of immigrants will turn this way.

concerned he proposes to pursue to
the end the work he has undertaken
without deviating a hairbreadth from

is interpreted as applying to the work

. The missionary further asserted that
the Hereros rebelled partly through
the oppressions of the traders, partly
owing to the cruelties Inflicted on
them, and partly on account of the dis
regard of the Germans for the sacred
ness of the marital relations of the
natives.
BERLIN, March 22. â A missionary
in Southwest Africa has written a let
ter to the Reichsbote, defending .the
Hereros against the charges of massa
cring women and "children and the In
discriminate slaughter of men.
He gives the nanves of a number of
women who had been reported killed,
but who are all alive, although the.
Hereros had opportunities to murder
them. Native Christians, the mission
ary addB, assisted a number of women
and children to reach the military sta
tions safely. 1
The missionary who wrote to "the
Reichsbote also related a case in which
three Germans sought refuge in his
house, two of whom were traders op
posed to the natives. The third was a
man named Martens- who a year ago
traveled through Hereroland, seeking
for a scot to establish a farm, and
gave the natives the Impression of
being fairminded and who maintained
pleasant relations 'with them. Hostile
Hereros came to the missionary's
house and seized and shot the two
traders, but they spared Martens.

It is reported that the defense set
up by Lieutenant Richards will be
temporary insanity, but what the de

FIELD EXERCISK FOR CAVALRY.
The field exercises of the Xinth Cav
alry, which will take place this morn
ing at 9 o'clock, will be of a highly
interesting character. It is the inten
tion to give a drill as though troops
were being landed upon a foreign shore
to attack the enemy located on a high
bluff above their landing place.
In the present case the enemy will
approach from the Bandy beach, at the
extreme- western end of the Presidio,
near the junction of Avenues A and B.
In this exercise the blue force will con
sist of troops I, K and M and the
brown force of troop L. Cantain Cor
nish will accompany the brown and
Lteutenant Camp the blue force, as
umpires. The troops on each side will
be uilder command of Captain John
T. Nance. The exercises will begin
promptly at 9 o'clock. The final ma
neuvers will probably take place on
the brow of the hill, about half a
"rnile west of the golf links.
The Twenty-eighth Infuntry held its
monthly field day yesterday morning
on the oarade ground in front of the
| Oeneral Hospital. The- recent rains
have put the field in bad shape, but
nevertheless the different events were
tried out. Following were the winners:
Putting the sixteen-pound shot:
i First, Cook Rowley, Company C, 30
feet 10 inches; second, J. Perkins. Com
pany K, SO feet \V* inches; third, H.
Bowers, 23 feet 8%. Inches.
Young of Company C won the 100
yard desh.
Riopelle won the running broad jump,
14 feet 11 inches.
The final of the 120-yard hurdle was
won by Kyle of Company* G.
I The sports were cnlivenea by music
I of the Twenty-eighth Infantry band.
While both Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Bor
land are non-committal concerning the
< hange, the fact is that there # has been
more or less of an official 'shake-up
in New York as well as In this city
and at other places where the National
Surety Company has branches. Mr.
Dean, present vice president of the
United States Fidelity and Guaranty
Company, was until very recently iden
tified with the former company. When
he changed his location certain of his
friends did the same.
According to Mr. Borland's version
of the matter, a rumor was circulated
seme time ago that the. National Surety
Company was about to go out of busi
ness. He telegraphed to New York for
ir.fnrmation and then went to New
York to se^k the knowledge he desired.
He met President Joyce of the National
Furety Company and a^ked whether the
company was going to retire. Mr. Bor
land d^Fired to get nn assurance from
the company's executive committee, of
which John A. McCall. president of the
New York Life Insurance Company, is
the chairman. This assurance was not
then forthcoming.
It has since been received and it is
announced that the company continues,
but in the meantime the change :n
manapement of the rival companies Â«.-n
this coast was made, and so the matter
stands. The managers speak of one
another in the friendliest terms. Th>Â»
Â¦shake-up, so far as reprards this coast,
would seem to have been due to a mis
understandin?:. President Joyce >f th.Â»
National Surety Company has recently
been in this city lo ( ,-king after the af
fairs of his eomnanv.
An odd story is told to account for
the sudden change in the management
(ft the National Surety Company of
New York in this city. Frank E. Gil
bert, who has been the assistant man
ager of the company, has been ap
pointed manager for the Pacific Coast
by William B. Joyce, president of the
company. James H. Borland, formerly
manager of the National Surety Com
pany, has gone over to the United
States Fidelity and Guaranty Company
and with Robertson and Hall will be
one of the general managers of this
company.

One of the Parties Says
Moves Are Due Entirely to
Rumor That Proves Untrue
After Mr. Judkins returned to San
Francisco, having with him a copy of
the contract to deliver to the San Fran
cisco committee, Schlueter gave notice
that he would recede and would, not do
the work after all. Within a few
weeks of the opening of the Exposition
and with not enough money on hand to
provide for all the expenses that the
San Francisco exhibit at St. Louis will
involve, this setback caused some ex
citement at this end of the line. Prompt
action was evidently necessary. The
committee met and decided to send L.
M. King to St. Louis without delay to
let a new contract and bo make sure
of a home for San Francisco at the
Exposition. It was also decided not
to give out any information about the
emergency that had arisen until news
of success could be received from Mr.
King.
Yesterday the expected telegram an
nounced that a new contract has been
awarded. But, with the rush to com
plete the Exposition buildings in" the
limited time remaining before the date
of the official opening.it was impossible
to get the same price for construction
that was mentioned in "the Schlueter
contract. Mr. King's telegram informed
the committee that the price agreed
upon and embodied in the new contract
is $16,250, or $4450 more than the first
contract price. The new contract is
awarded to New York parties. The
San Francisco committee has enough
money in sight to pay for the build
ing and for certain large permanent
exhibits, but the advance in the cost
of the building will make it necessary
that a few thousand dollars more than
the originally estimated sum shall be
raised to make the exhibit equal to
the occasion. The committee is work
ing to get sufficient money to make
certain that the San Francisco show
shall be a credit to and not a reflec
tion upon the city.
During the last week anxiety has
filled the San Francisco committee to
provide a building at St. Louis to
house the San Francisco exhibit at^ the
World's Expo/ltlon. Some time ago T.
C. judkins traveled to St. Louis in the
Interest of San Francisco and, under
the ' direction of the committee, let a
contract for tha construction of the
San Francisco building.
The contractor to handle the work
has been noted on the Exposition
grounds for engaging in^ large enter
prises. When he agreed to put up a
structure for San Francisco at a cost
of $11,800, that part of the Ban Fran
cisco enterprise at 6t. Louis seemed to
be certain of accomplishment at once.
Schlueter of Chicago was the con
tractor. He erected the California
State building on the Exposition
grounds.

BUSINKSS 3IEN SEEK TO
IMPROVE GEARY STREET
Bettinp on the Britt-Corbett fight
ruled 10 to 7 yesterday afternoon. In
the evening it dropped to 30 to 6!i
â¢with the possibility of going lower to
day. There is a lot of Corbett money
in the market to be wagered at 10 to 7.
There is also an abundance of Britt
money to be bet at 10 to 6. It is ex
pected the wagering will be lively to
day and the market will Boon settle
down to the odds at which most of
the" coih will be placed.
The demand for seats has exceeded
all exr-ectatior.s. From present appear
ances the boxers will fight before a
$45,000 house. Men who have handled
the sale of seats for many bis fights
say Â»hâ¬ present demand for tickets is
unprecedented in the history of fight
promoting in this city.
Young Corbett was a busy man yes
terday and managed to drive away the
blues that threatened to overpower him
by plenty of work. It was one of the
most eventful days the champ has
*pent since he began to train for his
engagement with Jjmmy Britt, and
after finishing up his work, he" looked
jjood enough to fight anybody.
CORBITTT WORKS HARD.
He was not in the best of spirits on
account of the weather and every time
he looked out of the window of the
gymnasium and saw the rain coming
down it made him savageâ so savage
that he would take an extra hard
punch at Billy Otts just for revenge.
Corbett did twelve miles on the road
in the morning and then lounged
around till 2 o'clock, when he par
took of a hearty dinner and then cn-
J-iypd another Ions rest. It was late
when lie repaired to the gymnasium,
but still the crowd was willing to wait
till he got readv for the afternoon
stunt.
He treated the exercise machine to a
few extra pulls and spent much time
in jolting it about. Then he skipped
the rope till the perspiration fairly
poured from his face. The swinging
bag and the light punching bag came
in for their share of rough work, after
wliich Billy Otts was trotted out into
the ring with his catcher's pad on.
'"orbett roughed it with his sparring
partner for four long rounds. He just
waded in and walloped the chest pro
tector until he got tired. When Otts
came at the champ he was alwavs met
with a few stiff jolts and the mixing
became fierce at times.
BRITT, ON TIIE ROAD.
Jimmy, the "cute little St. Bernard
puppy, was recovered yesterday, and
his return was the signal for much joy
in the camp. Corbett was worried over
thr loss of the fuzzv pup, and a big
weight was taken off his mind when his
1 nder brouÂ£ht him back to camp yes
terday morning.
DÂ»lly Otts has been matched tn fight
Jc:ry McCarthy, the -hampion weiter
v-rrght of Utah, before the ShamrocK
Athletic Club of Salt Lake on May 3.
The men will weigh in at 142 pounds
at 3 o'clock and fight for 65 per cent
of the gate receipts.
Road running and light gymnasium
work was the programme at Britt's
tamp in Alameda yesterday. Spider
Kelly, the trainer of the next fighter
to go against the redoubtable cham
pion .from Denver, is satisfied with the
condition of his man, and asserts he
will make the required weight by Fri
day evening without any trouble. It
1b intended that Jimmy shall carry
the extra few pounds as long as he
can and then get rid of them so they
will not be in evidence when he jumps
on the scales to weigh. ' By the time
he clambers Into the ring he will have
taken on some of the discarded weight.
Roadwork will be the principal part of
Britt's work from now until Friday.
ANNOUNCE BALIi SCHEDULE
FOR FIRST FOUR MONTHS
Baseball Magnates Make Known Play-
Ing Dates for Teams of tlie Pacific
Coast League.
The schedule committee of the Pa
cific Coast Baseball League finally an
nounced the schedule for the first four
months of the coming season. Ac
cording to the schedule, the season will
open to-morrow afternoon. Seattle will
meet San Francisco in this city, Oak
land will meet Los Angeles at Los An
geles and Taeoma and Portland will
cross bats at Fresno, which will be
the home town for the Taeoma team
during part of the season.
The Bchedule provides for five games
each week In this city and two at Oak
land â on Tuesday afternoon and Sun
day morning. For the first time in the
history of the game San Francisco will
not have continuous ball. From June
12 to July 12 there will be no games
plryed in this city, because the home
team will be away on the road. . There
will be no baseball In California during
that period, aÂ« the six league teams will
be contesting In the northern cities.
The coming season will be what is
known as a "double season." At the
hnd of the first four months another
schedule will be arranged, and It will
probably be so fixed that all the games
will be played" in California during th*
rainy months.
A large number of Geary-street
business men met last night at
Vaughan & Keith's studio and formed
thÂ« Progressive Geary-Street Improve
ment Club and outlined plans for the
proposed improvement of Geary
street. The club is composed mostly
of prominent merchants on that thor
oughfare and their object is to make
Geary street second to none in the
city. The meeting was Inaugurated
by the election of H. G. Vaughan as
president and H. Schessler secretary
and treasurer.
Horace Platt of the Geary-street
railroad was present and offered a few
valuable suggestions. He said that if
the company could secure a franchise
from the Board of Supervisors he
would guarantee â¢ to transform the
present cable system into a modern
underground trolley electric system
and arrange with the United Rail
roads so that passengers from the
Geary-street line might travel to all
part of the city on one fare.
It was decided to bring the matter
before the Supervisors at the earliest
opportunity. An effort will "be made
to light the street in the business sec
tion â¢ with thirty arc lights on every
block and also to have a concert at
Union square every Saturday after
noon. The following committees were
appointed at last night's meeting:
Lightingâ T. E. Valentine of the John
Breuner Company, S. B. Hicks of the
Kirk, Geary Company, H. P. Bristol

STANFORD UNIVERSITY.- "March
22. â Norman E. Dole. '05, who won
the title of champion pole vaulter of
the Pacific Coast in the last inter
collegiate field day with a vault of 11
feot 7*i inches, cleared the bar this

Dole been performing in an inter

BOTH MEN WORK HARD
Old Searcher had another easy one
passed to him, the mile selling affair,
fifth to be decided. Looking half an
hour the best horse, the liberal price
of 2 to 1 could be had. Contrary to
custom, Holbrook, who rode the favor
ite, picked the rail position. The aged
sulker outclassed his company so much
that he caught up with Batidor the
last part of it, winning by almost a
length. Decoy quit early in the game,
show. honors falling to Carilee.
It was apparently not Travers' day
to shine In the saddle, for he had the
mount on Galanthus, favorite for the
last event, and finished third. Again
it could be said he was beaten on the
best horse. Roach, on Mlnio, cut loose
from the field at the start, and in a
driving finish led Criss .Cross out a
neck. Travers came up from the uni
v -sity section of Berkeley with the
favorite and then only lost by two
and a half lengths.

Travers was also beaten on Light
of Day, favorite for the two-year-old
scramble at half a mile. With the
race well in hand he threw the filly's
head away a hundred yards from
home and Martin, astride Escobosa,
scored by nearly a length. Saccharate,

dangerous at one time, tiring, how
ever, as the wire was approached, and

beating next time out.

Captivate in the third selection, even
if the mare was beaten something like
a dozen lengths in a race^ the preced
ing day. A word to the wise Is suffi
cient, and many took a seat in the
front row, popular prices, 6 and 7 to

take, and in a hard drive disposed of

purse for "Doc" Kyle with Lady
Atheling. Travers on Resigned, the
18 to 5 favorite, led^into the stretch
by more 1 than a length and would
have won but for miserable piloting.
Travers got over the ridge and into
the ditch or the extreme outside, and
Smith, on the second choice, won by
a length. J. Jones finished third with
Hogarth. Crlgli received support, but
was ridden to no advantage by Shee

track was ankle deep with mud.

Nearly Every Winner on
the Card Is Quoted at
Liberal Odds by Bookies
The officials of the Amateur Driving
and Athletic Association, which organ
ization has in hand the raisins of funds
for the new speedway and athletlo
grounds In Golden Gate Park, are san
guine of success.
The first lot of subscription books
were distributed yesterday to person*
interested in the cause. Each sub
scriber is given a small receipt upon
the payment of the amount he desires
to contribute. Later on he is sent a
certificate showing the amount of his
subscription. A clause in this reads
that the money will be returned if the>
required $25,000 cannot be raised or If
better terms cannot be made with tha
Park Commissioners. It Is also agreed
that If more than the required amount
is subscribed the surplus will be re
turned pro rata.
The officers are confident they can
raise the amount required within sixty
days. When this Is placed to the credit
of the Park Commissioners tha work
will be commenced immediately and
will be hurried as much as possible.
The plajs indicate a beautiful ad
dition to Golden Gate Park. It will in
clude a speedway, built cm the most
modern lines, a cinder path for athletes
and an Infield suitable for polo, base
ball, football and other sports.
The members of the association will
meet to-morrow night in room 1000,
Palace Hotel. The meeting is open to
all persons interested In the new pro
ject to add to the park's attractiveness.

CONVENTION* IS CALLED
BY VINEYARD OWNERS
ASKS COURT TO DISPLACE
ATTORNEY CHARLES G. XAGLG
Given by His Former Client, the
Late Elizabeth Boyne.
Formal Proceedings Involve Note
In the estate of Elizabeth Boyne, de
ceased, Judge Coffey yesterday granted
an order directing the executor, James
L. Nagle, to show cause before htm on
Thursday morning why the court
should not appoint another attorney
for the* executor in place of hi3
brother, Charles G. Nagle, to defoml
an action b rou ght against the estate
by Dr. H. J. Conradt, the present
holder of a note and mortgage for
$2500 given by Mrs. Boyne shortly be
fore her death t& Nagle & Nagle, who
were then her attorneys. Both the
Nagles said yesterday that they would
not oppose the petition, in fact, they
said James L. Nagle had called on
Judge Coffey only a few days ago to
ask for the appointment of another at
torney to defend this suit.
The note and mortgage, which wert
given to protect the attorneys* fees In
the numerous litigations in which Mrs.
Boyne was involved with Dennis Kear
ney and others, were assigned by tha
lawyers to Thomas Moran and by him
transferred to Dr. Conradt, who re
cently entered suit thereon. The not*
and mortgage have been attacked by
Lent & Humphrey, attorneys for
Fathers Caraher and Torke, the resid
uary legatees under Mrs. Boyne's
will, and Judge Coffey granted the or
der to show cause yesterday on thein
petition.
The petitioners set forth that aa thÂ«
Nagles are indorsers and therefore
guarantors of the note, they are
estopped from properly defending
Conradt's suit. Attorney Humphrey of
the law firm said yesterday that fraud
was not charged against the Nagle* la
the petition.
Organization for General Good and to
War Asalnst Insect Pests Is Mo
tive for Action.
A committee, consisting of John
Swett of Martinez, Noah G. Rogers of
Los Gatos, Frank T. Swett ot Mar
tinez, G. M. Westcott of Concord, Bur
ton A. Towne of Lodl, Leonard Coates
of Fresno and John Markley of Gey
serville, have issued a call for a con
vention of vineyard owners In this city
to be held at 31 Post street on Friday
and Saturday of the present week.
The purpose of the meetings is to form
a permanent organization. The call is
in substance as follows:
A small number of men who make their
living by the culture of their vineyards have
come to the conclusion, after comparing views,
that the time has come when the grape grow
ers of this State ought to make some effort
to help themselves by means of some kind of
organized effort. The dangers that confront
us. If not alarming, are very serious. The
phyUoxera we are holding in check by means
of resistant roots, but we have yet much to
learn about the adaptation of different kinds
of resistant roots to soil and climate condi
tions, and about the affinity of different vinl
fera cuttings when grafted upon resistant
roots.
We are menaced by a still greater danger
In what Is known as the "anaheim." or "Cali
fornia vine disease." which has already de
stroyed many thousands of acres of vines
and is slowly making its way Into vineyards
which the phylloxera had spared. The dis
ease has thua far baffled the Investigations
of scientific observers and of practical workers.
The viticulture! department is doing all it
can with limited means and still more limited
staff to aid us now, as It has done in the past;
but the State University Itself needs behind
It the power of a larg*> organized body of the
men most directly interested in the preserva
tion of the vine. Is it the part of wise men
to sit down in our vineyards and cry aloud
for State aid or Federal Government experts
while we make no concerted effort to help
ourselves? These are the times that try men's
souls; let us show that we can fight in self
preservation.
One annual meeting- of two days will enable
uÂ« to establish committees of correspondence
and committees to urge county Boards of Su
pervisors to lend a hand in securing and pay-
Ing for exoert work. At the annual meetings
members can exchange views in an Informal
manner and give one another tha benefit of
their practical experiments. An organization
Ilka this might be known as "The State Viti
cultural Club." for the purpose of mutual Im
provement and mutual aid.

Audience at Century Hall by Ren
dition of Attractive Programme. .
Century Hall was the sce'ne of a de
lightful song recital last night by Mrs.
M. E. Blanchard. Notwithstanding
the inclemency of the weather the hall

composed of a trio of ancient Italian
songs of the sixteenth century, "In
torno all'idol mio," by CestI; "Se Flor
indo," by Scarlatti, and "Plaislr
d'Amour," by Martini.
Mrs. Blanchard's mezzo contralto
was also heard to advantage In
Brahms' "Feldeihsamkeit" and "Han
selein," by Taubert, a most delightful
creation. Of the French numbers "Le
Chevalier Belle-Etoile" met with
much favor.
"A Ballad of Trees and the Master,"
by Chadwick, was delightfully ren
dered. The programme as a whole
was most pleasing and demonstrated
the singer's great versatility. Fred
Maurer contributed to the success of
the affair as accompanist.

always contributed to the support of
the two children and without any rea
son the mother on Sunday evening left
the baby, George, on the doorstep of
the Falkenburg home at 543 Jessie
street, where he was discovered and
carried into the house. A warrant
was asked on a charge of abandoning
an infant, but it was deemed better to
make the charge one of cruelty.

ages for breach of contract against the
firm of Hysham & Neel is on trial be
fore a Jury in Judge Murasky's court.

fendants of an agreement to send to
this State 10,000 head of cattle to be
pastured and sold by the plaintiffs,
with the understanding that for its
services the firm was to have all
over 516 a head it received for the cat
tle. According to the complaint the
defendant sent only 2012 head, thus
preventing the earning by the plain
tiff of a sum commensurate with the
money it Invested In preparing to pas
ture the number of cattle it was
agreed would be sent.

A thief with a fancy for diamond
rings mixed among the frequenters of
the Hammam baths, at 1Â» Grant ave
nue, yesterday morning and selected
two that sparkled on the fingers of two
of the sleeping bathers, who had not
taken the precaution to leave their jew
els in the box assigned to each.
B. H. McLaughlin of the Royal House,
126 Ellia street, and F. J. Finch of Re
dondo, who Js at present stopping at
637 Post street, were the victims. Mc-
Laughlin's stone was 3^, carats and
was valued at 5450, while Finch's was
two carats and was valued at 5315. The
rings were on their fingers when they
went to sleep after having a bath, but
when they awoke the rings had, disap
peared.
Thinking that an attendant might
have taken the rings off as a precau
tionary measure while they were asleep,
they hastened to the clerk, who. dashed
their hopes to the ground by assuring
them that he knew absolutely nothing
about the rings. The attendants were
questioned, but denied ,any knowledge
of the missing jewels., Then it dawned
upon them that a thief had been in
their midst, and a telephone message
was sent to police headquarters.
Detectives Bunner and Freel were de
tailed on the case.
.vjien informed that she must go back
to the asylum, for a time, at least.
Bhortly before leaving for Napa she
was questioned in regard to the let
ters she had written. She admitted
the authorship and in a very deter
mined manner said she would not take
back a word she wrote. She refused,
however, to discuss their contents, say
iryr that she had been instructed by her
attorney, William Alford, not to dis
Â« sis? tJu-m or anything connected with
.her case-.
Mrs. O'Brien certainly does not ap
pear to be insane. She talks and acts
lationally enough, and during the pro
ceeding! yesterday displayed no evi
dence tending to Fhow that she is in
competent, except perhaps that she
broke into tears and grew excited
family and I know of several she has
v.ritten to relatives of patients at the
.hospital, accusing the management of
i he hospitatl of all sorts of wrong
dofne"
""She violated the provisions of her
parole and it was our duty to take her
into custody," he said in an interview.
"I know nothing about the charge that
thf was railroaded, but I do know that
beyond a dnubt she is insane. She
v as, at any rate, but if. after her re
turn to the hospital. I find that she is
row pane, she certainly will be re
leased, and immediately. Why, you
should see thp letters the woman has
Written me. I have several from her
in which she threatens me and my
Dr. W. L. Stone, who was present at
the- hearing before Judge Hebbard yes
terday, emphatically denied that there
v.as any attempt made by any one to
illegally restrain the woman of her
liberty, or that he feared any exposure.
STOXE DENIES CHANGES.
' According to the friends of Mrs.
O'Biion, her arrest is due to the ef
forts of Dr. \V. L. Stone, superintend
ent of the Napa institution, to prevent
her from making public certain alleged
abuses of the patients of the hospital,
srbich she threatened to do in letters
Fhe wrote to Dr. Ptone and to the rela
tives of inmate? of the asylum. It was
also intimated that she was the victim
of the spite of relatives. In connection
with the charge that Mrs. O'Brien is
bting returned to the hospital to pre
vent her threatened expose of the
methods alleged to be pursued there,
JT J. Kennedy, one of Mrs. O'Brien's
lawyers, said: "My client knows a
y hole lot about the manner in which
the hospital at Napa is conducted and,
because of her knowledge and the
threats she has made to expose the
officials, she is being 'railroaded" back
t<> the institution. It is an effort to
l-UFh her ui>, and she will not submit
to it."

â¢ A wrtt of habeas corpus was denied
Mrp. Carrie O'Brien yesterday by
Judge Hebbard. and she was remanded
to the custody of the officials of the
N'ayu State Hoepital for the Insane,
who, in consequence of Mrs. O'Brien's
failure to report to tht? authorities her
whertaboutP, as the law provides a
j'P.roled insane patient should, caused
l-.t-r to be arrt-stfd and confined in the
â¢insane ward at tht Kmergt-ncy Hop-
I-ital. pending her return to Xapa, She
Eftught her release on the ground that
Bht was not insane, but Judge Hebbard
denied in r the writ on the ground that
it should have been applied for in Xapa
County, the law providing that, once a
person is committed to an asylum, an
appeal fur release and consequent
i<~ptoration to capacity can only be
prosecuted in the county wherein the
asylum is located. She was returned
to the asylum yesterday afternoon, and
to-morrow an effort will be made to
eecure her release.
Police Are Notified, but
They Obtain Xo Clew
to the Paring Criminal
Burglars entered the saloon of D. E.
Collins, at First and Mission streets,
between S o'clock , Monday night and 6
o'clock yesterday morning. The . fact
that burglars had paid a visit to the
saloon was largely apparent when it
was opened for business yesterday
morning.
Collins made an inventory of the
stock that was left and reported to
Policeman T. P. Riordan that cigars of
the value of' $S2, nineteen pints of
champagne of different brands valued
at $24, eight bottles of whisky valued at
$11 and a bottle of brandy valued at $2
were missing. The burglars were also
'successful in working the combination
of the safe, but after the door was
opened they were confronted with a
locked strong box. They evidently were
prepared for such : an emergency with
tools, as the box was broken open and
the contents â $150 In coin â stolen.
The burglars also ransacked every
drawer in the place, and the floor was
strewn with papers and other articles
that had been in the drawers. En
trance was obtained by means of a lad
der,- which had been taken from in
front of the Langley & Michaels Com
pany's, wholesale druggists, 38 First
street. It belonged to painters that are
working on the building. They carried
the ladder to the saloon and placed it
against the First street entrance to the
saloon. They climbed up the ladder to
the transom, and the rest was easy.
The ladder was found about 100 feet

Captain Martin was notified and two
detectives were detailed on the case,
but so far no arrests have been made.

Judge Mogan dismissed the charge of
distributing adulterated milk that had
been made against Fred Gillette by Dr.
Macy. The physician failed to prove
his accusation that the milk had been
served to him by Gillette, and his as
sertion that the milk had been analyzed
and pronounced impure by the city
chemist was flatly contradicted by that
official, who testified that he had no
recollection of analyzing any milk for
the complainant.
Judge Fritz refused Attorney Can
non's motion to dismiss the charge of
embezzlement against Dr. T. F. Bren
nan, accused of having appropriated to
his own use $37,000 intrusted to his
keeping by the Rev. Father Gray, and
testimony for the defense will be heard
to-morrow.
Violet Carter, accused of robbing a
Portuguese mariner - in a Washington
street saloon, had a flock of feminine
witnesses examined before Judge Mo
gan, and with affecting unanimity they
testified that they knew nothing detri
mental to the defendant's character.
They were employed in a Pacific street
dance hall, of which Violet was the
terpsichorean star, and they did not
see her do anything more reprehensible
than to induce her accuser to purchase
many bottles of beer. More testimony
will be heard to-day.
George Lavelle, whose beat as a beg
gar was in the vicinity of Fifth and
Market streets, will be missed from it
for thirty days, as the imprisonment
prescribed for him by Judge Mogan
covers that period.
Judge Fritz reduced from burglary
to petty larceny the charge against
John O'Connor, who smashed a show
case in front of a Market street store
early yesterday morning and abstract
ed therefrom twenty-five neckties and
an umbrella. The charge was reduced
because burglary consists of feloniously
entering a building, which O'Connor
did not do.
James Murray, who has only one leg,
entered the boot and shoe shop of Har
ry Perry, 239 Third street, night before
last and solicited alms, and when re
fused became so abusive that Perry
undertook to eject him. During the
scuffle that ensued Perry struck Mur
ray's nose with a hammer, breaking
that organ, and then had him arrested
for battery. Murray obtained his re
lease on $5 bail, but when Judge Mogan
heard the facts of the case he Increased
the amount to $100, and now Murray
is in jail.

Mr. Coyne of 739 Tehama street was
engaged in a fistic argument with an
other gentleman in front of the Coyne
residence when William Moore entered
the house and, it is alleged, attacked
Mrs. Coyne, who complained to Officer
Curtin, who arrested William Moore.
Judge Mogan has the case under ad
visement.
Lee Ow is on Mogan's docket for
keeping an opium den at 32 Ross al
ley and six Chinese were arrested at
the same time for being Inmates of the
place. The Judge is considering what
he would better do with the greasy
group. To warrant conviction it must
be proved that Lee Ow either sold or
gave opium to his fellow prisoners,
and that is what Police Sergeant
Christensen, who led the raid. Is un
able to prove. So it looks like dis
missal and another chance for the po
lice to complain to the Grand Jury
that they find it difficult to convict in
the police courts.
pocket had been picked and that Po
lice Officer Cooney, a fellow passenger,
had picked it. Cooney was in plain at
tire, else McGrain might not have
made the accusation and then empha
sized it by smiting the policeman's
nose. He was greatly surprised when
Cooney placed him under arrest, and
now he is wondering what sort of a
sentence Judge Mogan will hand out
to him this morning.
Pat McGrain, who has attained some
notoriety as a boxer, was aboard a
Mission-street car and bound for the
pony races at Tanforan when he sud
denly conceived the idea that his
When an inquisitive policeman ar
rested Charles Lyton for begging on
the street and searched his clothing he
found 83 cents in one of the pockets
and Judge Mogan sent the opulent
mendicant to spend three months in
the County Jail.
There is discord in the home of the
Stohrs, No. 8 Stanyan street. The
mother of Frank Stohr bequeathed to
him a deed to the residence, and his
sister, Clothilde, a teacher in the pub
lic schools, is suing to have the deed
set aside. Brother and sister live in
the house, and the latter keeps Mrs.
F. M. Todd and an aged gentleman
named W. G. Gibbs, also dwelling
there, for the alleged purpose of pro
tecting her from her brother. The
presence of Mrs. Todd, and Mr. .Gibbs
is obnoxious to Frank, and last Sun
day he ordered the old gentleman to
get out and stay out. This command
was resented by sister Clothilde, and
In a scuffle that ensued Frank is al
leged to have struck Gibbs with a
whip. Arrest of Frank.
After the case in all its bearings
had been heard by Judge Cabaniss he
continued it for thirty days in order
to afford the parties opportunity to ar
rive at some kind of an amicable un
derstanding as to who should and who
should not retain possession of the
house, as It is apparent that peace can
not be preserved while Joint occupancy
Is maintained. It is understood that
Frank Is taking legal steps to get
Clothilde ousted.'
Alexander Campbell, an attorney,
was held by Judge Cabanies in $500
bonds to answer to the Superior Court
on a charge of felony embezzlement,
he having failed to turn over to one
Espanoza the sum of $60 which, it is
alleged, that person employed him to
collect from one Ross.
Alfred Smith, George Redmond and
Edward O'Brien were found guilty of
burglary and Judge Cabaniss held
them to the Superior Court with the
bond of each fixed at $3000. They are
accused of entering the grocery of E.
Ring at Twenty-fifth and Mission
streets and stealing $8 from the till.
All of . the foregoing was corrobor
ated and considerably elaborated by
Gismonda herself. Perish the idea of
her having tendered any provocation
to the defendants. True, her relation
ship with them had been somewhat
strained for some time prior to that
memorable night, but she had studious
ly endeavored to keep out of their way.
Ae for hurling an obscene nickname
at either of them, far would it be from
her to do such a thing. She guessed
she never forgot she was a lady. Her
facial injuries kept her at home four
days and she still suffers from the ef
fects of the nervous derangement
caused by the assault.
A masculine attache of the so-called
theater had witnessed the assault and
heard the epithet that provoked it. No,
he did net interfere. His prescribed
function was to serve beer to the pa
trons of the establishment â not to "split
out" warring comediennes.
Other ladies will testify this morn
ing, and it is rumored that some of
them will ascribe the assault to pro
fessional and personal jealousy. Gis
monda, say some of her friends, can
sing more sweetly than either of the
defendants, and in the matter of per
suading gentlemen of the audience to
purchase llauids she holds the^ Bar
bary Coast record.
It was on the night of March 1 and
in the below-the-sidewalk temple of
public amusement at Jackson and
Kcarny streets that Mane Alberts was
assailed by Tiilie King and Lola Hal
lett. Attorney for the defendants did
not attempt to disprove the assault,
but directed his efforts to the end of
convincing the court that complainant
furnished sufficient provocation to jus
tify the beating she received. This
provocation was oral, he claimed, and
so often did he repeat an uncompli
mentary epithet alleged, to have been
addressed by Miss Alberts to one of
the defendants that the Judge protested
in the interest of decency.
Leontine Center, a matured soubrette
with a wealth of flaxen hair, was the
most interesting witness of the lot. She
was on the stage, regaling a small but
select audience with one of the latest
popular song hits when the "doing up"
of Gismonda occurred, and. although
the assailed lady was her friend, she
remained on the stage and heroically
continued her warbling, thus prevent
ing a possible panic among her hear
ers. When she finished her "turn" she
inspected the visible injuries of Miss
Albert, and found they consisted of
many deep scratches- on her face, a
pair of blackened eyes and a dimin
ished coiffure. So distressing was the
sight that it incapacitated Miss Center
for further professional effort that
evening, and she doffed her stage cos
tume, donned her street apparel and
went home.
Jling of the spectators and the forlorn
prisoners in the cage.
The distinguished visitors graced re
served chairs within the rail and their
beauty and talent enabled them to di
vide attention with the attorneys who
Sff strenuously battled for or against
the cause of Marie Alberts, whose stage
title is Gismonda. She sat fondling" a
pretty little girl, her daughter, and
the youngster played with a golden in
signia of wlfehood that graced the ma
ternal finger. But if Mr. Alberts was
among those present he practiced self
effacement.
There were unwonted, sounds and
smells in the court of Mogan while the
assault and battery case of Marie Al
berts vs. Tillie King and Lola Hallett
was on hearing. The parties are of the
vaudeville profession, and a bevy of
their sister artists were there to do
the witness act. Most of the ladies
were of hard-to-guess age, blonde of
complexion, buxom of figure and fash
ionably attired. Their perfumed pres
ence disturbed the tribunal's every day
odor of staleness and the froufrou of
their silken gowns mingled queerly
with the every day shuffling and snif-

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 22. â A price movement
of first-class importance, with a mystery at
tached, stimulate/^ the languid speculaative ap
petite of the stock market to-day. Union Pa
cific was the leadÂ»r of the movement, but the ,
mystery centered . about the Northern Securi
ties Company and the probable process of its
dissolution. All the securities related to that
company and Us Interests made free price
movements. But as Union Pacific is the only
one of them In liberal supply in the market, the
bu!k of Of. activity was in that stock, and
it wag fMiiously active, on dealings in 1000
to &0u0 bliire lots. The source of this buy
ing, as well as its motive, was kept obscure.
Bankers associated with the finances of the
company emphatically disclaimed any part In
the buying or any knowledge of Its cause,
and were. In fact, sellers with tome ostenta
tion of the stock at Its highest price. Great
Northern preferred and Northern Securities
Â«Â»re in demand on the rising price scale.
Other etocks concerned in the Northern Securi
ties have disappeared, but the Oregon Short
Hue 4's. which are secured by the Union Pa
cific's Northern Securities as collateral, and
the Burlington Joint 4's. which were exchanged
for Burlington stock, were active and
higher. The prlncipaL question in the public
discussion of this problem has been whether
Northern Pacinc and Great Northern stock
should be redistributed to the holders from
whi.m the Northern Securities received it or
to present holders of Northern Securities in
proportion to thÂ» \-aluc 'at which that stock
has been exchanged for the merger stocks.
The buoyancy of Union Pacific was presumptive
evidence of tho safeguarding of the advantage
secured Â»o that company bv Its controlling
interest In Northern Pacinc before the merger.
The market closed without nny announcement
to clear away the day's mystery. Money was
*8?y. Until the enormous buying of Union
Pacific the market was. Inclined to extend
without additional news, unless it might be
the disturbing Influence of the Sully complica
tions. The rise In foreign exchange was
cheeked and the gold export movement thereby
apparently deferred. The arrival of $2,500,C00
additional Japanese money at' San Francisco
wag also reported.
The closing was strong and active.
The bond market was strong, led by bonds
related to the Northern Securities merger.

The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdle, section
director of the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau. Is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The t^n^jerature was nearly normal during
the week, with lower temperature at the close.
The weather was generally cloudy or partly
cloudy and rain Ml Dearly every day in tha
central and northern sections, with frequent
thoners ia otiier section*. Kiverg and creek*
in lortlons of Northern California again over
flowed tfctir banks and considerable damage re
fulttd. Heavy snow fell in the mountain dis
tricts.
The broken levees in the Sacramento and
Pen Joaquin district* are being closed, and In
SL>me jjlan-s there ie a. possibility that fair
crops may be raised this season. In the over
sowed fct-ctlons and in the districts where *x-
CMEtWB: rains have submerged the lands grain
is not dates well, and it Is feared 1 that the
viÂ»ld will iall below early estimates. Sun-
Fhine and warm weather will do much to im
rrove conditions. In all other sections grain
is rrocrttd in excellent condition and making
E'.oa growth, with indications of a large crop.
Ttu lrin!c!l In the southern districts Is still
belo* average,- but its distribution recently
has been must favorable, and the crop pros
pect its considered better than at any time
auring the- season. The Incessant rains in
NcrthÂ«rn Cali:ornia have caused a suspension
of t?.rni:ng oix-rations. and tiie cultivation of
crrhardt and h<y> fields ie being seriously re
tarded. Grass is making rapid growth in all
et-ctSons and er^en fÂ«-d Is abundant.
C'TxhP.rus and vineyards are in good condi
tion except in the flooded districts. Many va
rieties of deciduous fruits are In bloom and
pivt indications cf" a large yield. Pruning is
practically completed.
BACHJUtENTO VALLEYâ The temperature
Â»as nearly normal during the week and the
weather doady ar.d rainy most of the time.
ThÂ« !iÂ«**vy rains again flooded some of the low
lands, but llie damage was not great. The
breaks in the leveey are belna rauidly closed,
an<i in some of the overflowed districts it Js
bellev'C! partial crops may be raised. All farm
v;ork has bet-n suspended and thÂ» cultivation
of hou fields and errhards is being seriously
retarded. Grain has made good growth, but
in tome sections it 1Â» feared the crop will be
coxifjceraljiy curtailed on account of the in
ce*F.ar.t rainfall. Orass Is growing rapidly
Â«tr,e fc-i-d :s abundant. I>eclduous fruits are
in bloo*n and the outlook for crops in goods.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONSâ Wa^m,
cloudy weather prevailed most of the treOc,
Â¦with "rain nearly every day. In the central
ani northern dinrir-ts the precipitation was
heavy and considerable farming land was over
flowed. Grain is not in as good condition as
at the c!-^se of last week owing- to the con
tinuouc heavy rain?, and sunshine is ne*>d<d
lor all crops. The rainfall in the southern
districts was lightrr, but it was sufficient for
present purposes. Grain and grass are now in
â¢xrellfr.t condition in the south, and pros
pfcti- ar*? better than at any time during the
p<ason Orchards are In excellent condition
Â«xerpt in a few places that wer* overflowed.
and the outlook 1b good for a large crop of
deciduous fruit*. Apricots, reaches, pears and
plums m<? in hlootii.
SAN JOAQl'IN VALLEYâ Warm, cloudy
â¢wrathcr with frequent thowrrs prevailed during
the wÂ»Â»k and w?.i very beneficial to all crow
ing crops. Wfc*at and barley are making rai>ld
BfOWtil, Tilth prospects for a large crop. De
oici!"us fruit trerÂ« are in blo^m in all <iis
trir^y. The hich wind of the Wh slightly <1am
ac-j *.he blossoms in some districts. Many
\o-j-- vuiÂ«-y*r<Js are being planted, and old
KtaKU are making good growth and are in rx
cell'iM rendition, Gre*n feed is plentiful and
[ifk -ire healthy and improving rapidly. Con
r'.cVrarlo snow is resTte-1 in the mountains.
The fWd renditions remain -practically un-
CSuLRXed: the water remain* hiph In the ex
treme northern Fan JcAquin Rivrr. but no
<5ar*:Â»s" has b^/>n rÂ»pnrTÂ«<l since the last report.
COtrrUKRN CALIFOP.NIAâ The Tempera

partly â¢ \â¢Ay during the week,*" with frequent
Ugfat t-hf./rrs sad fairly hÂ»a\y rain in some

CHICAGO, March 22.â Marked increased in
terest to buy wheat was manifested at the
opening. July opened %Â®Vic lower to M&%c
higher at 86c to 8G%c.' May was unchanged
to %c lower at 91%Â©92c. From; the start the
volume of â¢ commission house buying was
larger than for some time past. Shorts were
active buyers. Possibly the most important
Influence- responsible for the increased Interest
was the issuance of the Kentucky crop report,
showing nearly 50 per cent decrease In the
condition of the growing wheat piant aa com
pared with, the condition a year ago. Presum
ably on the basis of the report .a rumor was
started that the next Government report would
be." sensationally bullish. The fact that the
Southwestern markets.- had small receipts to
day while making big shipments also helped to
create a better demand. Later in' the Â¦ session
the weakness in corn and oats brought out a
number of realizing sales In wheat and caused
a loss of about a'cent from the hight point in
July. July closed eteady at StÂ»%@sti',4c. May
closed Vic up at 82>4c.
During the first hour corn ruled quiet and
firm, influenced ' by the steady tone of cables
and by unfavorable weather and the close w^s
near the low point. May closed at 52VJC, July
at 49%c.
Oats .showed Â¦ weakness. The close was at
the bottom, with May down %c at 49 Vic and
July at 37%c.
Provisions j were strong early, but on the
break in' corn there was free selling by pit
traders and peckers which resulted in a gen
eral loss. ' The close was steady, with May
perk down 5c, lard 5c higher and ribs 2%c up.

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Rates remain about
the same, at 13s spot and 20Â®22s 6d for new

has a registered tonnage of 5446, against 8000

83.110 tons, against tfr.CCO; on the way to this

WHEAT â The markets all over the. world
continue flat and uninteresting, with no news
of moment, and Chicago alone shows sufficient
fluctuation to attract attention.- The closing
down of the Minneapolis mills Is supposed to
be due to the rcor di-mand for Flour. Cargoes
en route to Liverpool continue heavy and de

In this market the cash Wheat is a fraction
higher, and firm at the advance. The millers
are in the market, but they are about the only
buyers. There is little change in futures.

port, and as they bring more or less Butter,
the market of course Is affected.
Cheese remains as before, with a depressed
and oversupplled market.
Another advanco In Eggs is noted. They
are in smaller receipt than usual at thts time
of the year, and the purchasing activity in
Sonoma County continues unabated. Thla cut*
down receipts materially. The medium and
lower grades continue relatively firmer than
ranch.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Aside from a limited Inquiry for choice and
fancy Navels for shipment to Honolulu on the
steamer Sonoma, which sails on Thursday,
trade in the Orange market was quiet, aa tha
wet weather repelled local buyers. Owing to the
continued rains a large portion of the dally
receipts, particularly choice and standard
graies, are showing evidence of decay and have
to be carefully repacked before being offered
for sale. Six cars are announced for to-day's
auction. The other Citrus fruits were without
especial feature, and, with the exception of
Mexican Limes, prices of all descriptions stood
as previously quoted. An easy leehng pre
vailed in Limes and a steamer arrived late In
thr day. with fresh supplies.
There whs a lair amount of business in
ch^ap Apples, but fancy offerings moved
slowly. Bananas wfre in good supply, with
trade quiet at previous prices.

Other descriptions under this head continue
quiet. Peaches' meet with the most inquiry
and prices are steady. Stocks of Apricots ara
reduced to practically nothing. Apples are
steadily held. Prunes are in better supply
than anything else, and holders are reported

TTÂ»e tratriD steamer Hero. Captain Sytort
pen. which arrived yesterday five days from
La<Jysm!th with 02C0 tons of . coal, waa hove
to for thirty hours during the pasrage. Cap
tain Syvertsen reports that on March 10 h*
encountered a gale from the southeast and
southwest wheih blew with hurricane force.
Tiw forward bulkhead of the Hero's poop was
carried away, windows and doors on the stfir
board side were , stove in and considerable
other damage Uon|- about -the clicks. During
the thirty hours tne vernel wns hcve-to it was
impossible to traverse the dÂ«?cks.
The steam schooner Ilalnler al$o had a hard
time nf it. When about forty miks off Tll
lsmrok. on March 10. during a heavy Emtth
weÂ«t s&Ie, the decklcad lashings snapped and
the decklr*ad of lumbf-r. wna washed over
board. The. steerlne gear was damaged and
the. clearing of the wreckage waa a terrible
tflek. The Itainior ninety-eight hours com
inK down from Neah Bay.
The arrival yesterday at Ferr.ar.dlna of the
Belgian steamer Clematis cost the local specu
lators In reinsurance about $7300. that amount
having been placed on. her "not to arrive."
She was forty-five days making the run from
Antwerp ar.d her f.rrival was not expected.
She was quoted at 40 per cent. What makes
the blow harder for those that contributed
the $7500 la the fact that cioet of them In
vested when the rale was \0 per cent and
iniesed the chance to set better than three to
one for their money by selling out when the
r;ite readied 40 per -cent. The British bark
Lamorna, v.hich left Tacoma twenty-four days
ago for Queenstown, was -quoted yesterday at
45 per- cent. The reason for this was the
finding a few days agro of some wreckage and
a bundle of letters belonging to the mate of the
vessel. .
A New Whaling Schooner.
Captain MoKcnno, who formerly command
ed the whaler Fearless, which was lost In
the Arctic seme years zgq, is ftttlne out the
schooner Charles Hansen for a whaling cruise
When the Hanren leaves here she will carry
a gasoline engine for the schooner Altalr'
which Is already -In the north. The whalinrr
steamer Hermann, formerly the missionary
ship JdcrniiiK Star; the Gayhead and the
Alexander are all ready for sea. When they
get away the schooner Monterey will be the
only whaler .left in port 1 and she will follow
very shortly. The Gayhead will go direct
to the Arctic instead ot making the usual
preliminary cruise through the South Seas
and to the coast of Japan.

\ Stato of Innocence
A question of the wisdom of too-early
Bible teaching was brought forcibly- to
a mother's mind. She arrived home
one afternoon to hr.d the house in con
fusion. All of her palms and pottei
plants, of which she had many, had
been removed to the nursery and ar
ranged in a semicircle on thp floor. In
the midst of this improvised grove sat

Among .the passengers that arrived
here yesterday on the steamship City of
Sydney were three sailor men that were
driven from their floating home by
flames during a December gale and
withj their shipmates reached a storm
swept South Atlantic island after a
thrilling twelve-hour ride in small
boats. The fire-blasted ship was the
Clarencp S. Bement, and those of her
company that reached here yesterday
were Cantain G. G. Grant. First Mate
R. R. Grlndley and Carpenter J. B.
Truby.
The Clarence S. Bement was owned
by George W. Hume of this city, but
Captain Grant is a New Yorker and is
now on his way home. The Bement
left Philadelphia August 16 and New
port News September 22, bound for this
port and loaded to her full capacity
with a cargo of Baltimore coal. It was
at noon of December 22, while the ves
sel was in the clutches of a fierce
northwester, that Captain Grant dis
covered his ship on fire. Daily tests had
been made of the temperature of the
cargo, but the thermometer, even after
the flames had eaten a way through
the decks, told no tale of unusual heat.
The tests had bee^h made near the
hatches, where coal usually heats first.
fn the case of the Bement, however,
conditions were reversed. Before the
warning smoke appeared the flame3
had eaten their way through a wooden
bulkhead and- crept upward to the deck,
which was all ablaze within a few min
utes after the first smoke was seen.
Fighting the fire with water was out
of the question. The vessel already had
all the weight she could carry, and
Captain Grant decided that the only
hope of saving the lives under his care
was to run for the nearest land, which
was Care St. John of the Falkland
Islands and about eighty miles south
of the Bement's position. Sail was
crowded on, and while the ship tore her
way through the angry waters those on
board did their best to hold the names
in check by smothering.
By 4 o'clock, however, the blaze shot
through the ventilator hatch in the
midship house, and the flames took full
charge of the ship. The boats were pro
visioned, supplies sufficient to last for
some weeks beJns put aboard. The
sails were cut adrift, and when the ves
sel rounded to both anchors were let
go, finding holding bottom in twenty
five fathoms of water. The boats were
launched and Captain Grand and his
24 officers and men pulled away from
their blazing home. . As they pulled
away from the ship's side the flames
shot aloft, lighting the ocean for miles
around. Closely reefed sail was hoisted
on the boats, but before they lost sight
of the Clement her stout steel masts
had melted at the base and toppled into
the seething furnace, which now
glowed in the iron shell.
The boats reached Fox Island twelve
hours later. A high surf made landing
difficult. The second mate's boat was
smashed to atoms, but the whole com
pany got safely ashore and were cared
for by a hospitable Scot, who had
chosen that remote end of the earth
for a sheep ranch. A mail schooner
took all but the Captain's Japanese
steward to Port Stanley. The steward
remained on the sheep ranch to cook
for the Scot. From Port Stanley the
shipless Bailors were carried Jo Monte
video, where the United States Consul
took charge of the sailors. Before leav
ing*Port Stanley Captain Grant cliirfbed
a mountain and through his binoculars
took a farewell glance at his ship.
Without a apar standing and with
6moke rising from her hold the hull of
the Clarence S. Bement was still riding
at her anchors, and will probably ride
there until some well-equipped hurri
cane comes along and wipes her out.
From Montevideo Captain Grant,
with his mate and carpenter, took
steamer for Valparaiso. Prom there
they went to Panama, where they
joined the City of Sydney. \
The City of Sydney brought up 1106
tons of cargo, treasure valued at $1680
and thirty-one passengers. Among the
latter were the following named: v
James Yocom, MlsÂ« Alice M. Brooks. Dr
Charles A. Stephens. Charles Zavala, M. o".

Excavations at Vesuvius.
The most recent excavation shows
that Vesuvius began Its work as a con
servator of antiquity earlier than .the
memorable year A. D. 79. During the
excavations in the valley of the Sarno.
near San Marzano, some most interest
ing antiquities have come to light.
These had been covered up by a vol
canic deposit about six feet thick,
which points to an eruption of Vesu
vius which must have taken place in
the seventh century before Christ. The
relics include a Greek burying place,
archaic Italian tombs and various
bronzes and terra cottas. â New York

Valuable Discovery Accidental.
Cheap commercial- acetjiene gas was
discovered by accident, according to
Harper's Weekly. Willson, a scientific
experimenter, believed that nearly all
metallic oxides cc-uld be reduced to a
metallic state by heating them to an
extremely high temperature by the
voltaic arc in the presence of free car
bon. Aluminum has been success
fully reduced in this way. Mr. Will
son wished to obtain metallic calcium.
He therefore mixed a quantity of
quicklime with pulverized coke and
brought the mixture to a high tem
perature by the action of the voltaic
arc. He expected to obtain a white
metal, but instead he appeared to pro
duce nothing but slag. This was
thrown into the yard and one day at
noon, while the boys were having their
luncheon, they picked up these bits
of slag and threw them at each other.
One p'ece fell into a pail of water and
produced a bubbling effect and a
strong odor. This attracted Mr. Will-
Fon's attention and upon investigation
he found that the strong smelling gas
was extremely inflammable. Further
investigation revealed that it was pure
acetylene gas.
Kels 1/rom the Nile.
Eels are so highly prized In Ger
many that the supply Js g*Â»ne.:{U!y
short of the demand .and an enterpris
ing German firm has therefore started
an eeling industry in the lower Nile
delta. . The" industry is centered in
Matarieh-Mensaleh. a station on the
railway, where a large depot has been
established, to which the eels ar*
brought for sale by the fishermen,
who receive for them about 1 cent
each. Before dispatched to Trieste,
.whence they are sent to Hamburg by
rail, the eels are cleaned, rubbed with
salt and packed in casks between lay
ers of ice impregnated .with forma
lin. It is expected- that when the
scheme is in full working order no
less than about sixty tons, or 150,000
eels, will be sent from Alexlndrhi
weekly: â Chicago News.

King Kd ward's Many Togs.
King Edward of England has a re
markably large stock of clothes, and
it is seldom that the King, when on
the Continent is seen wearing the same
suit twice. The King never assumes
fewer than three suits of clothes every
day. When he arises he puts on an
easy fitting lounge suit of black, navy
blue or dark mixture. Later, if he is
going to shoot, he dons a brown tweed
sporting costume, with his favorite Ty
rolean hat and feather. If he has been
subjected to any great exertion during
an outing he undergoes on his return
a system of massage and then dresses
for dinner.
If his Majesty made it a rule never
to wear the same suit twice, a simple
calculation shows that he would re
quire no fewer than 1095 suits in the
course of a year, whfch would bring
up his tailor's bill to about 555,000 a
year.
The King undoubtedly has the larg
est wardrobe of all the monarchs in
the world. At Windsor, Buckingham
Palace and Sandringham the King has
a total of about 200 suits of all kinds,
besides nearly a hundred hats and caps.
He hap, moreover, a splendid collection
of fur lined overcoats. For mornings
in the week the King at present favors
trousers of a pattern with a thin ver
tical stripe and a white' vest. The slip
which he lately made fashionable hns
been discarded. He also likes velvet
collars on overcoats.
To sum up, the Kiner orders about
thirty suits in the course of the year. â

Emigration from Italy.
Those who follow Italian affairs are
perfectly astonished at tljPyStatistlcs of
emigration. In 1869, what was consid
ered the immense number of 119,000 men
left their native country, the emigrants
oscillating between that and 135,000 up
to 1881, until in 1S87 thosenombers were
215,000, rising to 290,000 the. very next
year. Arrived at this figure, it seemed
as though the maximum must have
been reached and that the numbers
would decline; but instead, in 1891. there
was another rise to 293,000, maintained
for three consecutive seasons, the cen
tury closing with the enormous num
ber of 352,000 emigrants; but even that
was not the consummation, as, in 1901,
they were 532,000. Thus, in the first
two years of this century Italy sent
over 1,000,000 souls to other countries
to enlarge there the already numerous
Italian colonies. The largest contingent
of permanent emigration comes from
the center and the south of the penin
sula, while temporary emigrants us
ually go from the north, and are in
the greater part agriculturists, peas
ants, stonemasons and bricklayers.
When one takes into consideration the
fact that Itals* is obliged to import
yearly from 8.000,000 to 10.000.000 quin
tals of grain to feed the nation while
her workers are leaving the country in
such numbers, the only conclusion ia
that there is something seriously wrong
somewhere. â Pall Mai! Gazette.

Hyde and Dimond were at once taken
Into custody by United States Marshal
Shine, but this formality was soon over
with, as each of the accused lawyers
had his bondsmen ready. . Crawford W.
Clarke, the Sacramento capitalist, and
L. S. Sherman of Sherman, Clay & Co.,
this city, were accepted as Hyde'r sure
ties. For DUnond's appearance when
wanted Charles S. .Wheeler and WV R.
Sherwood appeared and duly qualified
as bondsmen.
The hearing before Commissioner
Defendants' counsel told the Com
missioner that they had not had suffi
cient time to study the indictment, and
therefore asked for a week's delay to
enable them -to prepare the defense.
This was opposed by the attorneys for
the Government, and the Commissioner
finally set the case for 10 o'clock this
morning.
Mr. Heney then asked that the de
fendants' 'Â¦; bonds be raised, declaring
that the sum of $10,000, in which each
of them- had been held, was incom
mensurate with the offense charged and
out of proportion to the ball required
in other cases of like gravity. John
A. Benson and J. H. Schneider, who
were jointly Indicted with Hyde and
Dimond for the same offense, had been
placed under $20,000 bonds at Wash
ington. Commissioner Heacock said
that inasmuch as Hyde was charged
as a principal in the indictment, while
Dimond's relation to the case' was
rather that of an accessory, he would
fix the bond of the former at $30,000
and that of the latter at $15,000. Mr.
Schlesinger objected vigorously to the
increase of bail, but without avail.
BONDSMEN ARE READY.
Fred A. Hyde and Henry P. Dimond,
indicted by the Federal- Grand Jury at
Washington for conspiracy to defraud
the Government of valuable Western
forest lands, were taken before United
States Commissioner E. H. Heacock
yesterday morning for their prelimi
nary examination. Their attorneys
asked for an adjournment of the hear
ing, but the Commissioner consented
to only one day's delay. Hyde's ball
was increased from $10,000 to 530.000
and that of Dimond from $10,000 to
$15,000.
A great array of eminent'counsel con
fronted Commissioner Heacock when
the case was called at 10 o'clock. The
Government was represented by United
States District Attorney Marshall B.
Woodworth, with whom came Francis
J. Heney as special counsel, ex-Judge
M. C. Burch, special Assistant Attor
ney General of the United States; A. B.
Pugh, one of the attorneys for the In
terior Department, and O. E. Pagin of
the Department of Justice. The de
fendant Dimond was represented by
Charles S. Wheeler of Bishop. Wheeler
& Hoefler and by Samuel Knight of
Page, McCutchen & Knight, while Gar
ret W. McEnerney and Bert Schlesin
ger appeared for Hyde.

HYDE-DIMOND
CASE IN COURT
Heacock is for the purpose of deter
mining whether there i3 sufficient evi
dence to establish a probable cause
against the accused. If the Commis
sioner finds that the crime charged
has been committed and that the evi
dence makes it probable that the de
fendants were parties to It he will
hold them for trial. The trial, if
the men are held, will take place at
Washington, D. C, where all the four
indicted men, who are now under bonds w
for their appearance, will be required*
to present themselves.
The power, however, given the Board of
Public Works to have "charge, superintend
ence and control" of the repair and main
tenance of any and all buildings and structures
owned by the city and county Is free from
such .limitation, since no such power -appears
to have been conferred upon the Park Com
mis-Mon'Ts with respect to the buildings under
their control. While no express authority ! is
conferred upon either board to insure such
buildings eucn power may be properly im
plied.
It It a general and undisputed proposition
of law that a municipal corporation possesses
and can exercise not only such powers, as -are
expressly granted, but also those necessarily
or fairly implied in or incident to the powers
expressly granted. (1 Dillon Mun. Corp.. p.
145; Von Schmidt vs. Wldber. 105 Cal.,^151.)
. And It has been held l>y the court of In
diana that the power to control and maintain
public buildings includes, as a nfcensary in
cident thereto, the power to Insure the same
and pay such Insurance out of the public
funds.
The power conferred by the charter upon
tbÂ« Board of Public Works to construct pub
lic buildings being general in Its terms muct
be held to have been restricted by the par
ticular terms of section C of article XIV. and
as so construed the "exclusive right" is' vested
In trie Park Commissioners "to erect and .to
superintend the erection of buildings and
structures thereon."
public buildings, because the charter
being silent on the subject it has been
construed that no department of the
municipality had the necessary power.
The matter, has been considered by
the Board of Education, which was' also
on the point of asking for an opinion
as to whether it had authority to in
sure the public school buildings. Presi
dent Roncovieri of the board has been
giving the subject much thought, be
cause if. a school building should burn
down there would, be no,. available
funds to build one in its place. . Long
in his opinion says:
The decision is important, as hereto
fore no effort has been made to insure
City Attorney Long yesterday ren-.
dered an opinion in which he holds that
the city, has the power toinsure public
buildings, although the charter con
tains no express provision to that ef
fect.
The opinion was rendered in response
to a query of the Park Commissioners
as to whether they had the power to
place fire insurance on the conservatory
or other buildings in Golden Gate Park.
Long says that while the Board of
Park Commissioners is without powej
to insure the buildings under Its con
trol, such power is vested-in the Board
of Public Works as a necessary Inci
dent to their express power to superin
tend, control and manage' the repair
and maintenance of all public build
ings owned by the city and county.
This investigation by the Finance
Committee is considered ominous by
the clerks themselves, especially those
employed in the boards of Health,
Public Works and other boards in
which Mayor Schmitz has assumed
control. The employes figure that,
owing to the strained relations now
existing between Mayor Schmitz and
the . Board of Supervisors, the lat
ter body will materially cut down the
appropriations for salaries. Some of
them may thus be thrown out of em
ployment or have their salaries re
duced.
The Mayor has effected a retrench
ment in the Health Board and Is anx
ious to put the same policy in effect
In the Board of Works. The war be
tween the Mayor and the Supervisors
over the next budget .promises to be
an exciting one!. The Mayor has the
rower to veto any specific appropria
tions In' the budget if : he so chooses,
and it will require' fourteen votes in
the board to override, him. It is an
cpen question whether ,the opposition
can muster the necessary fourteen Su
pervisors to overrule . the Mayor, and
It is oft the cards for the adoption of a
compromise before summary action is
taken by the board.
The employes in the .various depart
ments of the city government are be
coming decidedly uneasy, owing to a
quiet investigation now being pursued
by 'the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors.
The Investigation is being directed to
the amount and kind of work per
formed by the clerks and other em
ployes of the city, with' a view to
ascertaining If the services of some
can be dispensed with when the appro
priations for salaries in the next muni
cipal budget are adopted by the Board
of Supervisors.
With that end in view the Finance
Committee has employed H.-A. Mason
to inaugurate a system of observation
among the clerks of the various city
offices. Mason is secretary of the
Municipal League and, through the
grace of the board, has been accom
modated with desk space in the upper
committee room of the board. Mason
is at present receiving no .compensa
tion, but the Finance Committee has
assured him that provision will be
made In the next budget to pay him
for bis services.
The Finance Committee is maintain
ing the secrecy about Mason's,
employment, and on that account has
not introduced a resolution in. the
board formally authorizing him to
represent the committee in ; the matter
of inquiring into the necessity for the
employment of the various clerks.
Supplementary to. Mason's inquiry,
Supervisors d'Ancona and Payot are
also making personal investigations
for the committee that will guide them
ir. designating the amount in salaries
to be allowed the city departments
during the next fiscal year. Payot and
d'Ancona have visited the office of the
Board of Public Works during the last
few days and closely questioned the
clerks in the main office, the bookkeep
ing and other departments as to their
exact duties. .
When Hynes' petition was presented
to Judgre Kerrigan he promptly issued
the order requested, making it return
able before him on Wednesday, March
30. when Perry, Nagle, Rickman and
Miss Nightengale will, under oath, be
compelled to explain the whereabouts
of the money.
Although Hynes does not make any
<Jirect charges against the respondents
he intimates in his petition that a
searching Investigation by the court
will reveal a peculiar state of affairs.
He charges that Rickman. Perry.
Nagle and the alleged daughter of
the Kryzyanowski woman "are sus
pected of having embezzled, concealed
and made away with the funds of the
Kryzyanowrki estate."
Public Administrator M. J. Hynes,
through his attorneys, Cullinan &
Hlckey. made a start yesterday in the
fight he intends to wage to recover
what is left of the estate of Palagia
llaria Kryzyanowski. He filed a pe
tition asking the court to direct
Charles Rickman. former executor of
Mrs. Kryzyanowski's will and her
residuary legatee, whose powers as
executor were suspended last Novem
ber by Judge 'Troutt; Charles H.
Perry, his attorney, and Charles L.
Xagle, attorney for Marie Nighten
gale, also known as Marie Kryzyan
owski, who claims to be a daughter
of the Polish woman, to appear and
Fhow what has become of $11,000 that
has passed through their hands since
the $30,000 estate of Mrs. Krj-zyan
owFki came under their control. Marie
Nightengale is also directed to appear
and explain her dealings with Nagle,
Perry and Rickman in connection
with her appearance as the daughter
of Mrs. Kryzyanowski.

the idea of paying Mrs. Clarke alimony
while his suit is pending, as he was
ordered to do by Judge Seawell last
week. ' He will within a few days taka
an appeal from the order to the Su
preme Court.
Mrs. Clarke asked the court to award
her, $250 a month alimony pending the
determination of her husband's suit,
$2500 counsel fees and $500 for cost3
of court. When her motion for alimony
was heard before Judge Seawell he
made an order granting her $100 a
month temporary alimony gnd $500
counsel fees. The order for ' counsel
fees was not prejudicial to a petition
for more, and in denying the motion
for court costs Judge Seawell made a
similar ruling. When the order was
made Clarke asked for a stay of pro
ceedings for five days, and on securing
the stay immediately set about the
preparation for his appeal. - Notice of
the appeal will probably be filed to-day.
