WASHINGTON. Jan. 11. â It ts
learned here that in 1S98 Mrs. Jack
Gardner of Boston began the Importa
tion of paintings and other works of
art. which were admitted free of duty,
Â¦which were originally intended for
XJUbJic exhibits. It Is understood that
the importation aggregated about
SI. 000.000. A month ago the Treas
ury Department began to receive
complaints from citizens of Boston to
the effect that, while these pictures
and works of art were supposed to be
on exhibition, they were unable to see
them. The department placed the
matter In the hands of the United
States Attorney In Boston, who re
ported that the law had been violated.
Proceedings were about to be Insti
tuted, when Mrs. Gardner paid the
duties under the law, amounting to
about $200,000. This payment, it is
understood, was made about three
months ato.
- The Dally > News, which represents a
large Fectlon of the 'British public dis
liking - that treaty, regards Balfour's
speech as a "plain ' and unnecessary
threat "to 'Russia," and declares" that
the treaty was made without consult
ing- the British representatives in Ja
pan, who, since i ts adoption, have re
peatedly warned the Government of the
perils ' attaching to it."
Dispatches from Seoul record further
arrivals there of Russian marines. Rus

BALFOUR'S SIGNIFICANT SPEECH
Premier Balfour, speaking at Man
chester* last night, declined to discuss
the "differences between Russia- and
Japan, on the ground that such discus
sion would do little service to the cause
of peace. The Premier said: Â¦ ,â¢
"No one can contemplate hostilities
between, two . great'dvllized countries
without feelings of misgivings and of
depression."
Premier Balfour added that Great
Britain would carry out to the fullest
extent nil her treaty obligations.
Premier Balfour's guarded state
ment is commented on by this morn-
Ing's newspapers as an intimation of
the Intention of the Government to ac
cord full support to Japan in the event
of circumstances arising which would
call Into action the Anglo-Japanese
treaty.
Reports from Tokio and Shanghai
say that the Dowager Empress of
China and her court have for the pres
ent abandoned the Idea of fleeing to
Hslansu on the advice of thÂ« foreign
Ministers.
from St. Petersburg and Tokio, to-day
take ,a calmer -view of the situation.
The view taken in European capitals,
based on 'the outlines of the Russian
proposals published in Berlin and the
incidents of the' past few days, is that
although Russia has not modified her
demands she Is displaying a more con
ciliatory, tone and a willingness to ne
gotiate, which is attributed to the
Czar's personal influence on the side of
peace.
SEOUL) Korea. Jan. 11.â The Jap
anese Minister has- made reiterated .de
mands, hitherto -without result, upon
the Emperor of Korea that he . recog

Korea, the Korean Government holding
itself to the Russo-Japanese agreement
concerning Korea.
LONDON. Jan. 12.â The Times' Pek
ing correspondent, cabling under yes
terday's date, says the Chinese Min
ister in Tokio, at the request of the
Japanese' Foreign Office, telegraphed
the following communication to Prince
Ching: , .
"The second Russian reply 'to the
Japanese proposals has been received
at Tokio, but it is unfavorable and can
not be accepted by Japan, which, will,
unless Russia recedes, be compelled Â«to
promptly resort.to arms.'
"In view of suchf an eventuality Japan
urges and expects China to maintain
the strictest neutrality, to preserve or
der throughout the empire, to guard
foreigners resident In the interior and
to take especial care to preserve order
in the provinces of Shantung and Yu
nan, lest, foreign powers might seize
the pretext of disorder and make ag
gressive movements therein."
The correspondent says that. the dis
patch has deeply Impressed the qhl
nesei who now believe .war to be cer
tain. He adds that notes looking, to the
ratification of the treaty between China
and Japan were exchanged yesterday
afternoon. . , -\
RUSSIA GRANTS NO CHANGES.
It Is learned that the terms enunci
ated - in the forecast of j the Russian
communication to the powers, cabled
from Berlin to-day, and which gave the
substance of Russia's proposals to Ja
pan regarding Manchuria and Korea,
are practically Identical with Russia's
former reply, of which Japan asked. a
reconsideration. , It is said that Rus
sia's last reply, .which Japan is now
considering, differs in no essential from
Russia's previous proposals, the only
difference being In the wording, to
gether with SjOme " minor concessions
concerning Korea, which, it Is said, Ja
pan considers immaterial.

clared the s revolutionists were ready
for any step and prepared to go to
any extremity. He said that one of
the objects of his visit to Rome was
to learn what support the Vatican au

pared to go to the length of leaving
that church and joining the Roman

, CHICAGO, Jan. 11.â Six thousand era- j
ployes of the city and of the United i
States Government located in Chicago !
,, have hit upon a plan which will give j
them all the advantages of belonging to j
a labor union without their becoming Â¦
in fact members of such an organiza- I
tion.
Ten thousand acres of land has been
acquired in the state of Chihuahua,
Mexico, and is at the present time held J
under an option. This land is the pro
posed property cf the corporation which
Is to be formed. Of this corporation,
which is ostensibly to be a land-holding
organization, policemen, firemen and j
postal employes are to be the share- |
holder*, and all the deliberations of the
body are to be held behind closed doors.
Lest any member shall acquire un
due powejvand in order, that the de
sire for profit shall not induce the gen- |
oral _public to enter the corporation,
one of the chief rules is declared to be !
that no one shall hold more than ten j
' shares cf stock, the par value pf which
is Jl per share.
With the money thus gathered,
which may be increased by as
sessment whenever the directors so de
cide, legislation is to be influenced.
In this city an organization of the po
licemen was broken up after a hard
fight, and within the last six weeks
Mayer Harrison and Chief Mushman of
the Fire Department have been com
pelled to issue a strong order against
the formation of a labor union by the
firemen employed by the city. At
'present neither the firemen nor the po
licemen in this city are allowed to be
members of a secret organization which
carries with it any other allegiance
than that of the city government.

having conceded Japan's paramount

The questions at issue were dis
cussed at to-day's conference of , the
'Cabinet and elder statesmen, and a
'final decision ' is expected to-morrow.
When this has been reached the con
ferees will appear before' the throne
and submit the answer -. agreed upon.
Then the final proposals of Japan will
be handed to Baron de Rosen.
China's decision to observe strict
neutrality In the event of war between
Russia and Japan was taken partly on
the advice of Japan. The latter points
out that the war could thus be localized,
Jhe disturbance of trade minimized and
that the danger of internal disorders in
China, as well as needless complications
of China's finances, would be avoided.
The note delivered by Foreign Min
ister Komura on Saturday to Baron- de
Rosen, the Russian Minister, was mere
ly preliminary to Japan's formal re
sponse, which has not yet been de
livered. .
TOKIO, Jan. 11.â The Cabinet and
the elder statesmen met for a Joint
conference at the official residence of

Embassador' Meyer ended by^p'ro
posing a toast to the -health of'^KihV
Victor Emmanuel and Queen Helena.
"Thie is the first time that an Ameri
can artistic Institute has been opened
by the head of a foreign state. To the
founders of the academy this fact will
be most gratifying and most reassur
ing. It will encourage their hopes
that- from the 4 modest commencement
they have made by their own unaided
efforts this academy will grow in a,
manner worthy of our country and of
Italy, which offers it a home." .;, : /-Â«
tentively examined the exhibits. 4
Director Mowbray gave an elaborate
dinner to-night at the Villa Aurora to
celebrate the of the exhi
bition. Among the twenty-five guests
were United States Embassador Meyer,
Signor Monteverde, president of the
Royal Academy of San Lucia; Count
San Martino, president of the Italian
committee to the St. Louis Exposition;
United States Consul General'. ;de
Castro; Professor Lancia, the .arch

Apolloni, the painter. . .'s"".V"f*"^
.Director Mowbray was the .'first
speaker. He recalled the factUhat th?
academy owed its existance principally
to Architect McKim, who was a .mem
ber of the Academy of San Lucia, and
who had been the recipient,*, of the
King's medal from the Royal' Institute
of British Architects. ... . â¢
"These are honors." said Director
Mowbray, "but who can.- say Mr.
McKim would not consider it a greater
honor to see this academy achieve high
position and be a credit, to the
tion?" 'V; : - â¢'
**'No truly great country has yet ex
isted without an art of Its^own." said
Embassador Meyer. "As yfiome coun
tries have turned to Greece, it is only
natural that the United States should
endeavor to absorb something from an
older civilization. The most gracious
recognition of King Victor Emmanuel
the most cordial interest taken by
Queen Helena to-day will do much to
give this academy the position which
we desire it to hold in the eytfs of; the
Italians and of the people of our own
country. Â¦_....
ROME, Jan. 11. â The King . and

AUBURN, Jan. 11.â The inquest into
the killing of E. M. Armstrong, on the
train Saturday night, by Thomas
Gostlin resulted in little beyond the
facts aJrcady given.
Conductor Bryce, J. K. Stephens,
Mrs. Delbert Baxter. G. C. Pierce and
M. D. Murphy all testified that there
was no conversation between the men
at the time or prior to the Bhooting.
Gostlin walked down the car to where
Armstrong was sitting and deliberately
fired three shots, two bullets taking
effect. The third was warded off by
Stephens and struck Gostlin'3 arm.
Armstrong evidently did not notice
Gostlin coming.
The trouble is raid to have been over
a lawsuit, thousrh it is intimated that
a woman Is Involved. .
VIENNA, Jan. 11. â A more hopeful
feeling prevails here regarding the sit
uation' in the Far East. A favorable
impression has been created by China's
ratification at this juncture of a treaty
with the United States. Makino, the
Japanese Minister, ' says that this
measure is bound to exert a strong
moral effect and that the most oppor
tune moment was chosen to consum
mate it.

United States Supreme Court to-day
granted a writ of certiorari in the case
of Hackfcld & Co. vs. the United
States, which will have the efTect of
bringing the case to this court for re
view. Hackfeld & Co. are the owners
of a steamship, in which unacceptable
Japanese immigrants were brought
into the United States. They were or

SHIP OWNERS GRANTED WRIT.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â In an opin
ion by Justice Brewer the Supreme
Court of the United States to-day de
cided the case of the Wabash Railroad
Company vs. William' N. Pearse, ex
ecutor of Charles fj. Pearse, involving
the question as to. whether a common
carrier retains a lien upon imported
goods shipped in bond to a given' point
and upon which tariff charges have
been paid by the company in transit.
The goods involved in this case con
sisted of four boxes of curios, purchased
In Japan by Charles E. Pearse, and
shipped via the Canadian Pacific Rail
way Company's steamers to Vancouver.
B. C. and thence over the Canadian
Pacific and connecting lines to St. Paul,
Minn., where the railway company was
required .to and ' did pay the tariff
charges, amounting to $264. The goods
were transferred to the Wabash Com
pany and by it delivered at St. Louis,
Mo. Pearse resisted the claim of the
railroad company to hold, the goods
until the money paid on account of the
tariff should be refunded and the* St.
Louis Court of Appeals sustained this
view. That decision was, however, re
versed by to-day's opinion, in which it
was held "that it is common law duty
of the carrier to receive, carry and de
liver goods and by virtue of this obli
gation it4s entitled to retain possession
until its charges are paid. Nor i3 this
Hen confined to Its charges for trans
portation." . V".
The treaty was signed on May 20,
1903, but was not ratified with the other
treaties between the United States and
Cuba at the close of the last session
of Congress. The Committee on Foreign
Relations held up the treaty until to
day and then reported it by order of
the Senate. The report of-the conlmit
tee recommended the adoption of the
treaty, urging: that it would not change
the political status or the relations be
tween Cuba and the United States in
any manner.
The Senate passed the amendment to
the tariff commission bill and then held
open until late to-night., awaiting thÂ«
action of the House, on the bill, and,
also decided as to whether 5 an adjourn
ment would be finally taken to-night: :
The House, after a long discussion of
the tariff question, during which many
amendments to the Senate bill were
offered, took a recess until to-morrow.
The prevailing opinion among thÂ»
representatives remaining m Havana,
appears to be that Congress ought not
to go further than giving President
Palma authorization to temporarily In
crease all the duties by 25 per cent..
The advocates of the lottery bill have
not risked the attempt to pass the bin
over v the veto of President Palma oa
account of the small attendance.
â¢HAVANA, Jan. 11.â The Senate, after
clearing legislative business and beins
in readiness to adjourn until the
spring, rushed through the ratification
of the so-called permanent treaty with,
tha United States. There was no de
bate and the vote was taken simply
by a show of hands.
The treaty includes all the provisions
of the Platt amendment verbatim.
This was the proposition 'the Cuban
Government made,' because of the de
sire to eventually eliminate the amend
ment from the constitution, and so re
move the cause of the constant criti
cism of the makers of the constitution
for accepting such an amendment from
the United States. The standpoint i3
regarded as immaterial whether the
requirements and restrictions of the
Platt amendment be continued In the
form of a constitution or in the form
of a treaty.
BERLIN, Jan. 11.â The Russian Gov
ernment has informed the powers that
it will 'respect .fully the right any na
tion has in- Manchuria under treaty
with China. This declaration is made
without reservation.
Russia gives formal expression to
this policy now in consequence of the
controversy with Japan, one of w^iose
persistent contentions has been for a
definition of Russia's policy in Manchu
ria and an acknowledgment of Japa
nese trade privileges. Russia's reply
has been in substance as follows:
' "We cannot discuss -Manchuria with
you any more than we could Australia
or the Philippines. Manchuria belongs
neither to us nor to you. It does not lie
within. -the jurisdiction of either of U3
to'dlsp'ose of the future of Manchuria."
Â¦rUisEia,^ however, is willing to observe
the. treaty rights of all the powers In
Manchuria, and now engages to do so.
Russia, it is added, thus removes from
theVnegotiatlons one of the points upon
which Japan counted for the moral
support "'b^' other powers and whereon
Bhe especially hÂ»d the sympathy' of the
.United States and Great Britain.
The terms of Russia's last .note to
Japan afe not known officially, here, but
ft is understood ; to '.'_ have produced a
quieting effect' . upon^ the \ Japanese
statesmen. Japan's reply, it is; assert
ed, will be in a similar tone.
f "Japan has Informed Germany that no
troops have,. bepn landed in Korea and
that Japan has' no intention at present
of landing troops.
'/.The published in London
on 'high' authority that Germany and
the triple alliance will remain neutral

LONDON, Jan. 11.â The Japanese
Government is alarmed at the report
that theÂ» Russian Black Sea fleet In
tends to pass through the Dardanelles.
At the request of the TokJo authorities
Baron Hayashl, the Japanese Minister
to Great Britain, lias made inquiries
on the subject- here, but the British
Foreign Office has not heard that Rus
sia has asked Turkey's permission and
Is notv inclined v to~ believe Russia will
raise such a question in Europe at the
present time, not only on account of
the Far Eastern crisis, but because of
the unsettled state of the Balkans.
It was said at the Foreign Office to
day that a circular somewhat similar
to the synopsis of the Russian position
in regard to Manchuria cabled to the
press from Berlin, to-day has been re
ceived, here. Cpmmentlng on it the
Foreign Office says that as no power
has acquired any Interest In Manchuria
except under treaty with China it falls
to see the force of Russia's circular.
Hears That Russia Intends to Send
Fleet Through the Dardanelles.
RUMOR ALARMS TOKIO CABINET.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â The State
Department has been informed; that
Japan" has requisitioned thirty mer
chant vessels for^ transports. Advices
received here show that the Russians
are increasing the guard at Seoul
daily and that the French have made
arrangements to establish a guard
there. ,
A cablegram to-day from Rear Ad
miral Evans, commanding the Asiatic
fleet, announced the arrival of the
battleships Iowa, Oregon and Wiscon
sin at Guam,' on the way to Subig Bay.
It was understood that the cruiser
squadron, consisting of the New Or
leans. Albany, Cincinnati and Raleigh,
would arrive at Guam to-day or to
morrow. The cruisers left Honolulu
in company with the battleships, but,
unlike the latter, stopped en route at
the Midway Islands.
Rear Admiral Evans will remain at
Guam until the cruiser squadron ar
rives, and it is expected that he will
be fully advised by cable of the policy
of the United States Government fcn
the event of war between Russia and
Japan, In order that he may dispose
of the vessels of his fleet in accord
ance with that policy.
Only that portion of the Chinese
treaty which relates to the opening
of the ports of Moukden and Antung
and provides in general terms for
prMlegres of American shipping will
become effective upon the exchange
of ratifications of the treaty, which
will take place within six week's.
There Is a possibility that the Chinese
Government will authorize its Minis
ter here? Sir Chentung Liang Cheng,
by cable to effect an earlier exchange,
but Minister Conger has not made
this request. . < - "
The other features of the treaty
abolishing the likin taxes and increas
ing the average customs dues on
goods coming from the United States
into China will not become effective
until similar treaties containing simi
lar provisions have been concluded
between China and the other powers
signatory' to the treaty of Peking. Be
sides the United States. England and
Japan have so far negotiated such
treaties, leaving Germany, France,
Italy, Austria and Belgium to effect
like arrangements before the new du
ties go into effect.
Requisitions Thirty Merchant Vessels

JAPAN* ACQUIRES TRANSPORTS.
The Lokal Anzeiger's correspond
ent adds that Admiral Alexieff, the
Russian Viceroy In the Far East, has
of late been sending two or three
comprehensive dispatohes daily to the
Government, ' in which he takes a
gloomy view of 'future developments.
The war idea is unpopular in Rus
sia, but it Is feared that some un
toward incident' may occur any day
which will make it inevitable for
Russia to become fully convinced of
Japan's warlike Intentions. - ; â¢
"Fifth â In reference to Manchuria,
Russia accepts no conditions, but de
clares that she is ready to permit
Japan and other powers Jo represent
their interests, embracing the 'open
door' for Moukden and Newchwang.
"The Czar personally edited and
corrected these points of the commun
ication." Â¦
"Fourth â A neutral zone fifty kilo
meters broad Is to be created between
Korea and Manchuria, along the Yalu
and Tumen rivers, in which neither
Russia nor Japan can establish forti
fied positions; also that the strait be
tween Japan- and Korea shall be neu
tral, thus giving free ingress and
egress to Russian vessels. .
"Third â Russia allows Japan full
commercial freedom of action in
North Korea, But Japan must not per
manently occupy fortified towns either
to the north or to the south, neither
on- the coast nor in the interior.
"Ssecond â In South Korea the Jap
anese can '-act not only in tKeir eco
nomic interests, but they can adopt
strategic action corresponding with
these interests.
zeiger gives a much more serious view
of the Far Eastern situation than has
hitherto emanated from the capital.
The correspondent claims he has au
thentic information that those in of
ficial circles entertain a greater con
cern over the differences between
Russia and Japan than they have
heretofore allowed to become known
to the public and he says he suspects
that the utterances of the press have
been optimistically colored in order to
conceal this official disquiet.
The correspondent goes on to say
that the Czar takes the keenest inter
est in bringing order into the compli
cated situation and that he insists that
an unvarnished report shall be made
public.
Recently Count Lamsdorff, the For
eign Minister; General Kuropatkin.
Minister of War, and M. A. Vasa,
chairman of the committee on- East
Asiatic affairs, assembled in the pal
ace -of Zarskojesselo to draw up a
communication, which .will soon be
Â¦published in the Government Messen
ger. This communication will give a
complete story of the negotiations
with Japan, including the latest de
velopments. The correspondent says:
"The Czar wishes, as he told Count
Lamsdorff, that the whole truth be
given to the public. He is personally
against war and refuses to believe that
it will come. He hopes to convince
Japan that Russia's wishes are rea
sonable and must be respected. The
communication chiefly embraces five
joints:
"First â Japan will get various con
cessions In Korea.
The Moskowskija. Vemostl says it Is
announced that Russia has acquired
the rights for the Holland submarine
torpedo-boats, and adds that it con
siders "this will render the building of
costly battleships unnecessary."
The paper ridicules the reports of
the depreciation of Japanese strength,
and says: ".
Â¦ "She has five millions of men nearer
the scene than Russia's one million.
Japan iÂ» better armed and equipped
and has powerful backers. Russia
cannot profit by- a victory and the re
sults of her defeat would be appalling
ltd the country." Â¦'â¢':-
MOSCOW, Jan. 11. â Notwithstand
ing^ the rumors' of movements on the
part of the Russian and Japanese
armies and navies, war is not con
sidered likely here. The Russktja
Vedomosti, which reflects the opinion
of influential merchants and the edu
cated middle class, says:
"It is more important for Russia to
foster internal development and hus
band her resources for a weightier
purpose than to seek the acquisition
of a yellow Russia, involving enormous
expenditures and profiting only adven
turers." â¢â¢
Says Russia Has Everything to Lose
and Nothing to Gain by War.
cess will attend his campaign of edu
cation remains to be seen. It' is ac
knowledged, however, that 99 per cent
of.the public believe that circumstances
have led Russia too far afield.
. Another method of arousing public
sentiment has been employed by some
newspapers, notably in the Far East.
They have begun calling the Japanese
"the Jews of the Orient." Moreover,
the whole press in Vladivostok and
Manchuria is dally emphasizing the ex
istence of the "yellow danger." But
this seems designed to cause Europe
to pause and reflect, rather than to
inflame the racial feelings of the Rus
sians.
It is pointed out here that the sta
bility of the Russian state loans
throughout the crisis cannot be ac
cepted, as a trustworthy index of the
feeling of the business world, since it
Is well known lhat the Government
regularly operates on the Bourse to
prevent fluctuations of its loans. The
Bourse otherwise has been weak. Many
stocl:s have fallen considerably.
MOSCOW PRESS PESSIMITIC.
A special dispatch to the Patrie
from Harbin, a town on the Manchu
rian Railroad, describes the ' Russian
war preparations. The Russian of
ficers declare war is inevitable, but add
that they are ready. Port Arthur, Jt
is further asserted, will be occupied
by 100,000 men, and in ten days re
inforcements of '100.000 can reach
Manchuria. ! â¢ â¢*
Manchuria .would "create questions of
political and racial domination. '
It -is asserted to be in the interest
of the commerce of Europe and
America that Russia should replace
China's authority within Manchuria.
It is also pointed out that Japan re
cently restricted the operations of
American insurance companies, and
this is cited as evidence that Russian
control of Manchuria Â¦ is likely to
prove as liberal to American and Eu
ropean commerce as Japan's. There-:'
fore it is maintained in governmental
quarters that it is to -the general ' in
terest of Europe and America to give
moral support to a settlement of the
pending conflict 'on the basis of
Japan's authority in Korea and Rus
sia's authority in Manchuria. Those
.wlio^are in the best position to know
Russia's intentions say her determi
nation to exercise her sphere of in
fluence In Manchuria is irreconcilable.
Owing to Russia's latest attitude in
Manchuria it is the view of official
circles here that the main issue of
the negotiations now centers in Man
churia instead of Korea. .-.y^H

NEW REPUBLIC MAY* GROW.
Island of San Andres Seeks Annexa
tion to Panama.
COLON, Jan. 11. â The schooner
Herald, which arrived here yesterday
afternoon from Bocas del Toro,
brought a commissioner from the isl
and of San Andres, who will endeavor
to obtain the annexation of San Andres
to the republic of Panama, owing to
the dissatisfaction of the Inhabitants
of the Island at the recent oppressive
actions on the part of the Colombian
authorities. The commissioner went
to Panama this afternoon to confer
with the Junta. He says 400 Colom
bian troops are now in garrison on theÂ«
islands of San Andres and Provlde'nce
and that more soldiers are expected
momentarily. *
The dissatisfaction, he adds, is gen
eral throughout the islands. During
the past few weeks no less than $18,
000 has been collected by means of the
property tax, which the inhabitants
are ndt In a position to meet, but
which they have been compelled to
pay. Several families have already
migrated to Bocas del Toro; conse
quently the ports of Providence and
San Andres are now closed. Coast
ing vessels are not alowed to leave.
This does not apply to American ves
sels trading with San' Andres. The
commissioner, who is a seafaring man,
left San Andres ; surreptitiously at
night time in a small schooner bound
for Bocas del Toro.
Many of those who desire the an
nexation of San Andres to Panama de
clined to sign the/petition, fearing the
possible consequences. _.
Panama is desirous .of annexing
San. Andres and Providence, but*lt is
believed that steps in that direction

".The Beauty Shop" Is Given Its First
Presentation at Fischer's and '
Is Heartily Applauded.
"The Beauty Shop" was given Its
first presentation at Fischer's Theater
last night and the frequent applause
with which the piece was greeted at
every turn was a tribute to the talents
of local composers who,' evolved the
lyrics and music of the farce. J. C.
Crawford and Miss Ada Clement have
every reason to be proud of their ef
forts, for the production is one of if
not the best that has ever been given
at this playhouse, or will be as soon
as the second and third acts are whip
ped into as -good shape as the first.
The material is there and all that is
necessary is, for the performers to per
fect themselves in their several parts.
Miss. Helen Russell; the new leading
lady, made an unmistakable hit from
the moment that the tones of her mag
nificent voice were heard in the first
number, "Navajo." until they were
given full play in a- waltz song by
Strauss. Her voice Is flexible, well cul
tivated and under splendid control, and
she is most generous of a splendid high
note, of which she sang no less than
six in her first song. Her rendition of
"Comin* Thro* the Rye" was a gem in
its way and she was compelled to re
peat it no less than three times, and
then the audience was loth to let her
go. Her dramatic powers suffered
sc-mewhat, most likely from, the fact
that she was nervous and probably
tired from a rehearsal which did not
end until an hour before the regular
performance began. 6he is handsome
and wears some gowns that were great
ly admired.
John Peachey, the new leading man,
proved a valuable acquisition to the
company with his pleasing barytone
voice, which he used to advantage in
"Obstinate Lizzie May," one of Miss
Clement's best musical bits In the piece.
Peachey earned the favor of the audi
ence at once and in every way de
served it. * .â¢"">.
Georgia O'Ramey demonstrated her
versatility as "Sapho Sweeney" in a
make-up " that was so ugly that one
marvels how such a pretty girl can
transform herself into such a hideous
creature. Miss O'Ramey is so homely
(In the play) that the same one could
wish that Madame Voluptia, the beau
ty doctor (Miss Russell), would . us'e
some. of her art to beautify her before
the end of the last act. Miss O*Ramey's
specialty with Ben Dillon, who plays
Professor Hercules Branagan, was one
of the successes of the piece, which
were many. Dillon's boxing bout with
Pugsy McGurk was excruciatingly
funny."
Kolb and Dill arp names to conjure
with, and it is needles3 to say that they
lived up to their reputations as German
comedians per excellence in the parts
of C. Schwa bber Pilsener and Jay Bier
pump Culmbacher, the latter the presi
dent of the pretzel trust. The audience
rose to the occasion when Dill entered
as the thin man and Kolb as the fat
man after treatment in Madame Volup
t'ia's establishment, for it was then that
Dill turned the tables on Kolb and ad
ministered a succession of kicks on his
stomach in return for the many he had
received from his partner in the past.
The. audience was hysterical when Dill
blurted, ..out, "You did this to. me' for
years; now I get back at you." Allen
Curtis also did good work as Jay Gould
and helps in tho fun to a large extent.
,The Althea twin sisters are clover, and
their singing of "My Chocolate Cream,"
with the dance accompaniment, was
gracefully done.. The chorus displayed
a variety of pretty costumes in the
numbers "We're Being Educated,",
"Along the Line," "Matutinal Medley"
and "Gathering Shells." The local al
lusions were comical and tickled the
risibilities of the audience. The staging
of the piece was excellent. : . ,

YALE MEN* OPPOSE TREATY.
Twenty Citizens Present Anti-Panama
Petition to Senator Hoar.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Jan. 11.âTwen
ty prominent citizens of New Haven,
headed by Professor Theodore S. Wool
sey, professor of international law at
Yale University, have signed and for
warded to Senator George F. Hoar a
petition asking that the Senate defer
ratification of the Hay-Bunau Varilla
treaty and that this Government's ac
tion in Panama be subjected to careful
and deliberate Investigation. Among
the signers of the petition are Franklin
Carter, formerly president of Williams
College; Henry Wade Rogers, dean of
the Yale law school; Frank K. Sanders,
dean of the Yale divinity school; Pro
fessors William G. Sumner and John C.
Schwab of the department of political
economy at Yale University, Secretary
C. A. Lindsley of the State Board of
Health, the Rev. Dr. Newman Smythe,
the Rev. Watson L. Phillips and Thom
as Hooker, members of the Board of
Education, and Samuel Â¦ L. Bronson,
formerly a Democratic candidate for
Governor of the State.
After declaring that there is a recog
nized body of law which ought to gov
ern the conduct of nations, irre
spective of their strength, the petition
says that a belief has arisen in the
minds of many In this country and
abroad "that in our dealings with the
state of Colombia we have violated and
are about to violate the rules of inter
national law, and that we are adopting
a line of conduct toward that country
which we would not have taken against
a stronger power."
The petition further says that the
fact of Colombia's comparative weak
ness should make us the more careful
to avoid the suspicion that we are mak
ing an unjust use of our greater power;
that the mere existence of such a sus
picion is' injurious to our honor and
self-respect, and concludes:
"We therefore respectfully ask that
before final ratification of the Hay-
Bunau Varilla treaty our action In
Panama be carefully and deliberately
Investigated, to the end not only that
this republic may do no wrong, but
that Its good reputation In the world,
which is dearer than any gain of lands
or trade, should suffer no loss."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â Senator
P.latt of Connecticut says that he has
received no information concerning the
action of the New Haven residents who
have forwarded a petition to Senator
Hoar.
"They may have thought I would not
present the petition," Jocularly re
marked Senator Platt. He added:
"There is a very strong anti-Imperialist
In New Haven who is much opposed to
the ratification of the Panama treaty,
and possibly he inaugurated the move
ment."
REYES MAKES A THREAT.

BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 11.â Harry R.
Fletcher, a well-known employe of the
Kern County Land Company, who has
resided In Kern County for nearly four
teen years, was arrested last night by
Deputy Sheriff Tower on a charge of
murder. The arrest was made on an
order from Sheriff Dillard of Texar
kana, Ark. The crime is alleged to
have been committed nearly fifteen
years ago. Details are Jacking, but it
\j said that Fletcher, whose right name
is reported to be James R. Coffee, is
accused of killing his cousin. Fred Cof
fee, in Hemstead County, Arkansas, in
1SS7 or 1S8S, that he broke jail and ha3
been a fugitive from justice ever since.
Fletcher has been known for many
years in Bakersfleld. where he has been
more or less steadily employed by the
Kern County Land Company in -the
building department. He Is a carpenter
by trade. During his employment he
has been saving his money and he re
cently purchased from the land com
pany a house and lot oa E street, near
Twentieth. To this home .he lately
brought his mother, and sister. Mrs. B.
H. Bell, and more recently Mr. Bell,
who was residing in El Paso, joined
his wife here. Bell says that all was
not harmony in the household and that
Fletcher did not treat Mrs. Bell prop
erly. Resenting this alleged ill-treat
ment Bell notified the officers in
Bakersfleld and those in Texarkana
that J. R. Coffee, wanted for murder
at the latter place, was none other
than Harry R. Fletcher.
Fletcher was seen at the County Jail
this morning, but refused to make any
statement concerning the matter. So
far as -pertained to the alleged crime
he said:
"I have lived In Bakersneld and vicin
ity for fourteen years. I came here as
a boy and am now 29 years of age.
Everybody here knows what my con
duct has been and I want to be judged
by my record here."

NEW YORK. Jan. 11.â A preliminary
examination of John A. Benson was
begun before United States Commis
sioner Shields to-day, '.mis Is sup
plementary to the regular preliminary
examination held In Washington last
week and is under section 1420 of the
Revised Statutes of the United States,
providing that when a complaint un
der the Federal statute is made in any
district and Is certified to the district
in which the defendant Is apprehended
an examination shall be held to de
termine whether Buch complaint is
warranted by the evidence.
William R. Macy, chief clerk of the
United States Land Office in Wash
ington, was the chief witness for the
prosecution to-day. On cross-examina
tion he admitted that the two land
department clerks, Harlan and Vaik.
who were concerned In tne alleged at
tempted bribers*, acted In their respect
ive clerical capacities under verbal in-
Btructions from both the Secretary of
the Interior and Commissioner of the
General Land Office, there being no
written law enacted by Congress or
â¢written regulations prescribed by Con
gress defining their duties, and that
such oral instructions were liable to
change from day to day.
Joseph S. Campbell of San Francisco,
assisted by Frank M. Platt. son of
United States Senator Platt, and Philip
Mansfield of Washington, argued that
no crime had been committed because
no act had been perpetrated which was
prohibited by the written law of Con
gress or written land office regulations.
Three witnesses are here from San
Francisco â Messrs. Slack and Johnson
and Miss Doyle. They are from the
office of F. A. Hyde and will be ex
amined to-morrow, when some sensa

HONOLULU. Jan. 5.â Consumption,
cigarettes and morphine were a com
bination which ended in the suicide at
the Hawaiian Hotel of William S. Han
cock, a youth of 20, who arrived here
recently, and was apparently a college
graduate of good family. With a mir
ror in one hand and a 45-caliber re
volver In the other he fired a bullet
through his head.
Hancock had plenty of good clothing
and Jewelr>\ but little money was
found among his effects. He Is said to
have been from New Orleans, and was
one of the liveliest passengers on the
last trip of the Ventura. He was an In
cessant cigarette smoker. The stubs of
twenty-eight cigarettes, thrown about
the room In which he finally ended his
consumptive sufferings, give testimony
to his indulgence in that habit to the
end. ,
Hancock was also a user of morphine
and this is thought to have contributed
to his depression. Several days ago he
was heard to say that he had not a
relative in the world. There is reason
to believe that this was part of a sui
cidal plan well thought out, with a
view to concealment of his real iden
tity. The suicide left little to show
where his relatives are, if he had any.
All that exists as clews to his identity
are his clothes, his name and his jew
elry. The cuff buttons bear a design
which appears to be of the Kappa-Ep
sllon Greek letter fraternity.
Hancock destroyed all his letters and
photographs before shooting himself.

lette, at a conference to-day, at which
the need of relief to the United States
courts of California was discussed, de
cided to each introduce a bill to-mor
row making as many different provi
sions to the same end. .with a view that
all be referred to the Judiciary Com
mittee and there the whole problem be
threshed out and the plan most to be
desired adopted.
Metcalf's bill will provide for an ad-,
ditional District Judge to be appointed
by the President and having the same
powers and jurisdiction is the other;
the senior Circuit Judge of the Ninth
Circuit or the resident Circuit Judge
within the district to make all neces
sary arrangements, and for the assign
ments of cases for northern districts.
Needham's bill will provide for the
creation of a new district, to be known
as the Eastern District,- to include
counties contiguous to the capital city
and the court to sit in Sacramento.
Gillette's bill also will provide for a
new district, to be called the Eastern,
the court to sit in Oakland, preference
being given that city because . most of
the work of the court would be In the
circuit of San Francisco, and th? Judge
thus be near at hand.
Metcalf says he "does not see the ne
cessity of a new court with Its expense
for United States Marshal, clerk and
other officials, as he believes another
Judge will answer every purpose In re
lieving the stress of business.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Jan. 5.â After twenty
years of service the Kalakaua silver
has passed out of existence as legal
tender. Only about $815,000 of the
coin has been redeemed, and the re
maining $185,000 is worth only about
half of its face value, theoretically,
for with all the dire predictions in' the
United States of what might happen
If the backing of the Government Is
withdrawn from the silver dollar, the
Hawaiian coin' is worth just fs much
now as It ever was. The coin, how
ever, has a historic worth that will
always keep it above par.
Not a single dime was offered for
redemption. There were $25,000
worth of dimes originally brought to
Hawaii when Clans Spreckels had a
million dollars coined for King Kala
kaua in 1883. The dime didn't re
main in circulation long, for specu
lators saw a splendid opportunity to
make a little money on the side and
bought in the entire Issue of 10 -cent
pieces. After that the dimes could
only be obtained at a premium, and
they are Quoted now at 40 and 50
cents apiece. The remaining $160,000
which have not been offered for re
demption are probably scattered to
the four quarters of the globe. The
bulk of it has been used in the man
ufacture of jewelry â pins, cuff but
tons, belts, buckles, etc. â while a
good many thousands of dollars'
worth of the coin Is believed to have
been melted in the big Chinatown
fire. All the jewelers have laid in an
extra supply of the coin within the
past few months, and probably sev
eral thousand dollars are tied ud in
this way. Collectors of coins have
also invested largely in the Hawaiian
silver, and although intrinsically the
money is not worth more than 50
cents on the dollar, the chances are
that no Hawaiian dollars will be pur
chased at less than 100 cents on the
dollar. It is more probable that all
the coins will be at a premium
within a few years.

Senate Tables Morgan's Motion to Recon
sider Confirmation of W. I. Buchanan's
Nomination to the Post of Minister
WASHINGTON. Jan. 11.â The Sen
ate in executive session to-day laid on
the table the motion to reconsider the
confirmation of the nomination of W.
I. Buchanan to be Minister to Panama.
The vote was 28 to 16, divided on party
lines, with the exception of Senator
McCreary (Democrat of Kentucky),
who voted with the Republicans. By
this action Buchanan now has full pow
ers to act for this Government in all
diplomatic exchanges between the
United States and the new republic.
The motion to "reconsider the confirma
tion was made before the holidays by
Senator Morgan, thus withholding for
three weeks Buchanan's commission as
Minister. In the meantime Buchanan
had arrived on the isthmus, where he
occupied the position of private citizen,
except for a special commission to act
as the personal representative of the
President in gathering Information
concerning existing conditions there.
Senator Morgan took the floor when
the Senate went into executive session.
.He made a general protest against the
confirmation of Buchanan as Minister
on the ground that* the position to
which the President had made the ap
pointment was not in existence at the
time the appointment was made and
could not be created without the co
operation of the Senate. Senator
; Spooner answered for the Republicans.
i He cited numerous authorities and pre
cedents in support of the President's
action.
Senator Allison also spoke briefly in
support of the administration and Sen
ators Bacon and Culberson favored the
Democratic contention. The motion to
lay Morgan's motion on the table was
made by Lodge.

OF AMUSEMENT
George Osbourne Jr. was engaged to
be married to Miss Eugenie Haydeh,
a prominent actress, who^is a member
of the same company in which the actor
was playing this season.
The deceased was held In the highest
esteem by a host of friends and he
gave every promise of attaining a dis
tinguished position in his profession.
The deepest sympathy is felt for the
parents of the young actor, who were
devotedly attached to their son.
The body of the deceased will be sent
to this city and will be interred at
Oakland.
When Charles Frohman sent Powers'
Chinese play, to New York and London
George Osbourne Jr. was engaged as a
member of the company. Returning
from, London Charles Frohman engaged
the young actor for the Empire Theater
company of New York City and the
young man made his first New York
appearance in the role of Bottashe in
"The Conquerors." He continued un
der Frohman's management and was
in the original cast of "Mrs. Dane's
Defense" as the leading juvenile. He
was the understudy for William Faver
sham in the principal character in the
play of "Brother Officers" and was seen
as John Hynes when the company
played in Boston and other cities. Last
summer he was a member of a stock
company at Albany, N. Y., and was the
recipient of nattering criticisms. This
season he joined Charles Richman as
leading man in the play of "Captain
Barrineton" and made a pronounced
hit. : > Â¦:.â¢ V
George Osbourne' Jr., the only son of
George Oebourne, the well-known ac
tor, now playing In this city, died early
yesterday morning in Detroit, Mich.,
after a. short illness.
The news of the death of George Os
bourne Jr. was received by his father
yesterday afternoon while the latter
was attending a'rehearsal at the Alca
zar Theater. The sad information was
a terrible shock to the father of the
young actor, as he had received a let
ter from his son only two hours before
saying that he was in the best of health
and recounting the pleasant Christmas
he had spent.
Although the management of the Al
cazar Theater desired Mr. Osbourne not
to appear last night the actor insisted
on doing so, and but few of the audi
ence realized that the player's gayety
was only on the surface and that he
was bowed with deep grief.
George Osbourne Jr. was born twen
ty-six, years ago -in Virginia City > and
was educated at a Catholic college at
Eureka. His father and his mother,
both players, were opposed to their son
going' on the stage and desired him to
follow, some other profession. V.
t The^ young man, however, was in
sistent, and without his father's knowl
edge secured an engagement with the
J. M. Ward company, appearing In
repertoire on the Pacific Coast. After
two seasons the young man induced
his father to use his influence and
young Osbourne was engaged as a
member of the Alcazar Theater com
pany. He made his first appearance
at the Alcazar in a i>roductl6n ot
"Rosedale" and also in Francis Powers'
play, "The First Born."
DEATH CALLS
YOUNG ACTOR
IN THE EAST
The last order of * business for " the
afternoon was the . selection of an ex
ecutive" committee composed of the
presidents of State organizations.
It was suggested that the relief
Bought by the sheepmen would* be at
tained could they secure the passage
of the bill now pending in Congress
transferring the executive control of
public lands to the Department of Agri
culture from the Department of the In
terior, for the argument was that the
former department knows the nature
of the lands and would work In har
mony with the sheepmen.
Professor Gifford, chief of the Bu
reau of Forestry, was introduced to
the convention and explained thie policy
of the Government relative to public
land that it is proposed to follow if
the executive control of foresUreserves
Is placed in the hands of the Depart
ment of Agriculture. He stated that
the desires of the sheepmen as they
have been exoressed during the con
vention would influence the Govern
ment's policy. The intention of < the
Government, he said, is to permit the
etockmen to use ranges under regula
tions to be determined upon, so.%that
exclusive, ranges j may be afforded la*r
abldlng sheep -raisers for use so long as
they observe ..the regulations f or ' the
protection of the reserves. He said (he
Government was ready to meet the
sheepmen and make Â¦ such agreements
as will be to the benefit of, all.
The action of the railroads in leasing
out public land grants for use as range
grounds was pointed out and it was
argued that the Government could do
likewise with profit to itself and to the
inestimable benefit of the sheepmen.
In a few words the expressed desire
of the sheepmen is that the Government
shall adopt a broader and more liberal
plan in relation to public lands. The
sheepmen want permission, to use the
reserves for grazing, subject to such
regulations as the Government may see
fit to adopt for the protection of the
forest reserves. These views on the
public land policy that should be adopt
ed were given before the convention for
the purpose of supplying Information
as to the desires of the wool growers
to Professor Gifford Pinchott and F. H.
Newell,' President Roosevelt's commis
sion appointed to consult with the
stockmen on this matter. -These repre
sentatives of the Government were
present.
PLANS FOR RELIEF.
The attention of the convention was
then directed to the condition of the
! range sheep' industry,' in the,- States', of
Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho.
;f Montana, Oregon,: Washington .and
Utah. . Representative "sheep raisers of
â¢(hose States gave brief reviews of the
conditions in their respective States.
These talks were devoted particularly
to the public land question. The con-
I sensus of opinion was that the Gov
ernment in setting . aside extensive
ferest reserves for the purpose of aid
ing irrigation and bettering natural
water 'supplies was going to the ex
treme and cutting down the ranges* to
j an unwarranted degree.
The speakers asserted that the in-
J terests of the sheepmen are suffering
and many are being forced out of busi
ness by the infringement on grazing
lands. While they admitted the neces
sity of preserving the watersheds, they
were of the opinion that this erld could
be accomplished and the interests of
the sheepmen be taken care of at the
same time. .
the fact that the amendment permit
ted organizations of sheepmen to mem
bership ln the Wool Growers' Associa
tion. The suggestion was made by the
secretary that the change in the consti
tution be ratified.
The crowded condition of public lands
and the encroachment upon ranges by
Government forest reserves was refer
red to. The report stated that this con
dition had resulted in the last year in
a large number of sheep raisers being
forced out of business.
Just before adjournment for lunch
eon Senator Warren announced that
President Roosevelt had sent his greet
ings and best wishes to the conven
tion. The announcement was received
with prolonged applause.
The afternoon session showed a larg
er attendance than the morning. The
real business of the day was taken up
when the committee on credentials re
ported and the constitution was
brought up for adaption. The only
change of importance in the new docu
ment was in the membership clause
admitting organizations of sheep rais
ers to membership in the Wool Grow
ers' Association. The committee on cre
dentials renorted, recommending that
the official roster of membership be the
roll call of the convention, and that
the representatives of the associations
be allowed the full vote of their asso
ciations. The, report was adopted.
When the matter of the adoption of
the constitution was put to a vote it
was sustained unanimously.
CONDITIONS ON RANGES.
Captain Hall of the Holyoke was not
even informed by Captain Roberts of
the condition of the Clallam and his
first knowledge that she was In Im
minent peril was when Captain Rob
erts, just before his vessel sank, sig
naled the Holyoke to cut the towllne
and stand by to pick up the people
about to be hurled into the sea.
3ELLINGHAM, Wash.. Jan. H.â
The young^woman Hst-d 'among the
drowneU from the steamer ClaUarr. as
"Miss Spencer, residence unknown,"
Â¦vras Miss Hattie Moore of this city.
How she came to be registered as Miss
Spencer Is not known.
Criticism of Captain Roberts is be
coming general in all the Sound cities,
particularly in Seattle and Victoria.
No one attempts to explain or excuse
the apparent lack of Judgment ln put
ting off the lifeboats laden with women
and children on the stormy sea fully
ten hours before the steamer went
down, or the failure to Immediately
transfer the remaining passengers to
the tug Holyoke as soon as she ap
proached the Clallam several hours
later.
H. M. S. Grafton left Esquimalt this
morning and went to the scene of the
Clallam wreck. It was the purpose of
the Grafton's commander, If the wreck
of the Clallam did not lie at too great
a depth, to send down divers In an ef
fort to recover the mails and any bod
ies that may have been caught among
the debris. The Grafton had not re
turned to Esquimau at a late hour to
night, so that the result of the search
is not known. It is possible that she
may rerrjain in the vicinity of the
wreck for several days.
Mrs. Charles N. Cox and "John
Thomas, who have been carried in the
list of dead with residence unknown,
were residents of Ladysmlth, B. C.
They were sister and brother, and had
been visiting another sister in Car
bonado, Wash. The remains of Captain
Livingstone Thompson and C. P. John
son of Victoria, the latter being; tha
fifth of those taken to Port Townsend.
were removed to Victoria to-nrght.
The funerals c-f the Victoria victlm3
begin to-morrow. W. J. Harris, the
Spokane capitalist, accompanied by
friends, went to Victoria to-day to se
cure the remains of his daughter, Misa
Louise Harris, which were picked up
in the first lifeboat of the Clallam. The
body will be brought here to-morrow
and transshipped at once to- Spokane
for interment.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 11. â No more
bodies of victims of the Clallam wreck
were discovered to-day # although the
erratic course followed by the disabled
steamer has been covered over and
over again by a dozen tugs. The in
ahore waters were searched by launches
and small boats, and the beaches near
Victoria and on San Juan and Whldby
islands have been patrolled by scores of
willing workers.
The thirteen bodies recovered Satur
day and Sunday have now been all
identified. The three women's bodies
unidentified at Victoria Sunday night
prove to be those of Mrs. Mary Rey
nolds of Seattle, Miss Hattle Moore of
Belllngham and Miss Minnie Murdoch
of Seattle. Miss Moore is believed to ba
the woman entered In the list of the
drowned as Miss Bellies. Miss Mur
doch has not been previously mentioned
among the pasaengers. She was the
daughter of R. Murdoch of Monroe,
Wash.. 18 years of age, and on her way
to visit friends in Victoria.
In the absence of Secretary Morti
mer Levering, the report of that offi
cial wag read by Assistant Secretary
Fred P. Jehnson. The report dealt
principally with the efforts to reorgan
ize the association under the revised
constitution. Attention was called to
GREETING FROM PRESIDENT.
PORTLAND, Or.. Jan. 11.â The con
vention of the National Wool Growers'
Association, which opened in this city
to-day, promises to be one of the most
important gatherings in the history- of
the organization. Questions of vital im
port to associations of sheepmen, indi
vidual raisers, the farmer and the live
stock man are being discussed. An ef
fort is being made to reorganize the as
sociation, to transform it from a mere
legislative bo$y Into a business, asso
ciation to protect and further the in
terests of its members.
The reconstruction was begun with
the adoption of an amended constitu
tion admitting lesser organizations and
associations to membership in the
parent body. The general expression of
sentiment is in favor of the sheepmen
getting the matter upon a more thor
ough business basis, that they may be
able to enjoy better success and be ln
a position to demand assistance when
it may be needed.
The condition of the range sheep in
dustry and the influence upon it by the
exclusion of sheep from forest reserves
was thoroughly discussed by repre
sentative sheep raisers from the ma
jority of the Western States. The sheep
men asked for a broader policy on the
part of the Government and the privi
lege of grazing upon reserves. Govern
ment representatives- promised the
adoption of a policy agreeing with that
outlined by the wool growers. During
the afternon resolutions were adopted j
asking Congress to pass the bill trans- j
ferrtng the executive control of reserves
from the Department of the Interior to
the Department of Agriculture.
To-morrow morning there will be a
joint session of the wool growers and
the National Live Stock Association,
at which a welcome will be extended
to the big convention on behalf of Ore
gon and Portland.
SENATOR WARREX SPEAKS*.
The convention was called to order in
the Baker Theater. United States Sen
ator Warren of Wyoming, president of
the Wool Growers' Association, pre
sided at .'the; opening session, and the
business of the convention was in
augurated with the reading of his an
nual address. He said in parU
The changes since 1SC3 in the wool growing
industry have brought about hew problems.
Among them is the adaptation of the Industry
to the public land laws with a view to foster
ing to the gr*atÂ«trt degree the most important
industries affected. In forÂ«Â»rt reservation mat
ters thpre- hae b^en friction and the patience of (
flock masters ha* bÂ«n sorely trie-i. But thrre j
is a prospect of forrÂ«ry matters being consoli
dated ln the Department of Agriculture and
for a satisfactory adjustment of many of the
troubles which have heretofore attended for
estry administration.
The Intercuts of the wool growers and wool
manufacturers are in the main neutral. There j
i* very little that the two can or should differ (
about, and a great lieal upon which both should {
ajree. In the matter of protection by means j
of tarifi for both there Ehould be no differences. J
ln the let 'station las* made upon the subject
end in rom:lderlnff dangers by way of legisla
tion or through treaties offered Vince, both as
rociationc have be*n a unit. In the matter of
rang* difficulties thÂ»rc Is -nothing needtd by the
wool grower that shomld be antagonized by the
woo! manufacturer.
! One matter in which there is an apparent
<ilfr>renpe of opinion is in the prevention of al
\rgcd fraudulent sales of woolen goods. The
Vool manufacturer*, while not taking open is-
Rie. are yet known to be fearful that the jjro
poaed "sheddy biif mirht inflict hardships and
jjerhapa Impossibilities upon the manufacturers
'without, as they think, reaching the desired
rerrwdy. We are reasonably certain that the
present protective larlfT legislation will not be
disturbed, and therefore we apprehend no vio
lent or sudden change in the industry. With
comparative freedom from apprebension on this
â¢Â»core we have time and inclination to seek bet
ter methods of preparing the wool for market.
and more satisfactory methods of marketing
in fact, we enter the year 1901 In condition
and with sentiment to improve and build up
and make permanently prosperous this great in
dustry.

Wyoming Delivers Address
Senator Scott. comments on the evi
dence Introduced tending to reflect di
rectly upon General Wood's character
aa a man by Impeaching hla Integrity
and veracity, and then, after summing;
up other, charges, says:
To my mind, a most grievous injustice has
been done in the preferment of General Wood
over, a hundred or more old army officersâof
ficers who won distinctions many bloody bat
tlefields â battlefields where more lives were lost
and more prisoners taken in one day than dur
ing the- entire Spanish- American war.
This I submit, was to me and must be to
every one perfectly monstrous. When did It
come about that this individual, a doctor in
civil life and a bloodless soldier, in battle, if
he ever saw a battle, has reached the exalted
position that he Ir unlike other people and Is
not to be accountable to any one, not even to
the. Senate of the United States, and will not
even honor it with his presence. Now, for my
part. I want to say that it is due to General
Wood, it is due to the people of the United
States, that he should not only explain, but
disprove many statements made in the evi
dence now here for consideration before con
firmation should be thought of. The fact that
he la willing to let this investigation go on
without personally meeting it like a man is in
Itself strong evidence, to my mind, that he Is
not made. of material that goes to make up sol
diers such as we need for our major generals
and. chiefs of staff. > â .Â¦
NOT ABOVE THE SENATE.
At the conclusion of the evidence of General
Wilson, the Junior Senator from Ohio. Mr.
Hanna asked that General Wood be brought
before the committee of this body having this
investigation in charge, to the end that he
might answer the allegations and accusations
made against him and relieve himself from the
unjust (as his friends claim to be the case) im
putations and criticisms made against his
character, and quite a colloquy ensued, it be
ing claimed by some of his champions that
there was no reason' for him to be heard; that
nothing had been proved against him; that
there was nothing for him to answer; in a
word, that he -was self-vindicated.
Referring to the conduct of General
Wood toward his superior officer. Gen
eral Brooke, Senator Scott says that
no impartial person â¢Â¦ can,- review the
evidence without reaching the conclu
sion that the charge of disloyalty is
fully established.
In reference to the support siven by
General Wood to gambling games
played in the Jai Alai Company's "fron
ton." Senator Scott says it is shown
by the testimony that General Wood
was a habitual attendant of the game,
especially spending his Sundays there,
on which days the betting reached as
high as $50,000.
In closing his review Senator Scott
says : -
The testimony of General James H.
Wilson concerning the advancement of
General Wood is quoted at length, in
cluding that portion which asserts thaf
General Wood was not ln the battle
of San Juan. In reference to this the
review says:
This statement of General Wilson shows
clearly the natural, resentment that will ex
lBt if this great wrong is perpetrated upon
the army of the United States by the confirm
ation of General Wood, and its injurious effect
must necessarily be very great, affecting as
it dees the ambitions of scores of young men.
which must be nlj>pÂ«l in the bud because of
the youth of General Wcod and the long time
that he may remain at the head of the army.
WOOD AND THE. GAMBLJ2RS.
The evidence ln this case quite clearly es
tablishes the fact that he wai appointed be
cause of his supposed capacity as a civil Gov
ernor, and there Is much to throw dtubt upon
the question of whether even his appointment
as a brisradler general was not regretted by
the President, and no one will believe that
Mr McKinley would ever think of promoting
him to a major generalship, certainly not in
the light of the present development.
Commenting on a statement in the
brief qf Senator Foraker calling atten
tion to the fact that it was President
McKinley who jumped General Wood
over hundreds of officers in the army.
Senator Scott says:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â Senator
Scott of the Committee on Military
Affaire has submitted ln executive ses
sion of the Senate a review of the evi
dence introduced before the committee
in the hearing of the nomination of
General Wood to be a major general.
Senator Scott made a strong per
sonal argument to the Senate ln op
position to the appointment of General
Wood to be a major general. He pre
faced his remarks with the statement
that confirmation to so high a position
as that of major general should be
made with due deliberation, and the
person to be confirmed should be highly
qualified and ln every way worthy and
above suspicion. Concerning nomina
tions of this character Senator Scott
Bays:
The President, the appointive power, is the
comniander-ln-chief of the army and navy of
the United States, and appointments in either
of these come from tym to those under him
with peculiar force and power, in that what
he says to those under him is to them the
law, and even complaint or criticism on their
part are really acts of insubordination. These
officers and men. thus cut eft from the right
of complaint. havÂ» a peculiar claim to be
heard here in the matter of appointments af
fecting them, and it behooves every Senator
to exercise his very best Judgment and do his
utmost to throw every possible safeguard
around this class of appointment?, particularly
when the act of confirmation has the far
reaching effect that this one will have.
REPLIES TO FORAKER.
The acquittal by a customs o^urt of
W. D. Ballantyne. formerly customs in
spector, fivho was accused o* having
conspired to allow Chinese to enter the
Philippines illegally, virtually ends the
scandal connected with the American
consulate at Shanghai, which was al
leged to have issued or connived at the
issue of fatee certificates for Chinese.

Special Dispatch to The. Call
NEW HAVEN". Conn., Jan.' 11.âWil
liam J. Bryan was the guest of honor
to-night at a banquet in Warner Hall,
at which about 150 Democrats were
present. Governor Garvin^of Rhode Isl
and and Congressman* de Armond of
Missouri were among the guests from
other States. The occasion took the
form of a celebration of Jackson day,
and was also declared by some of its
promoters to be intended as a sort of
prelude to the opening of the Presi
dential campaign in New England. Mr.
Bryan's topic was "A Conscience Cam
paign." He said in part:
The word "campaign" suggests warfare. It
is rood tactics to strike the ene:ny where he
ia weakest and to use the weaponB which are
most effective. The weak point of every bad
policy is that it sacrifices human rights to
selfish interests, and to-day to prove a sys
tem I of evil we* have . only to show
that It violates Hiat sense of justice
that is satisfied with ._ nothing less
than equal rights to all and special privi
leges to none the only appeal that Is perma
nent la its effectiveness and enduring in its
usefulness is the appeal to cAscienoe. and,
while it may seem weakness to the brutal and
folly to the sordid. It arouses a response that
Is at last irresistible.
If we would touch the consciences of others
we> must give evidence that our consciences
have been quickened. The great lsue at this
time is that between man and mammon, be
tween plutocracy and democracy. All sur
face questions of policy, of taxation, of regu
lation and of finance are but phases of that
century-long-, that world-w|de struggle be
tween the common people and' organized wealth.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 11.â The third
annual convention of the State Council
of the Federated Trades was opened in
this city this morning. '
William Pook, president of the Sac
ramento Building Trades Council, de
livered an address of welcome, in which
he extended the hospitality of the Sac
ramento Council to' the. delegates.
President P. H. McCarthy responded
in an address in "which he spoke of the
prosperous condition of the councils
throughout the State. He said that
there had been a gain in membership
of several thousand during the past
year. The president said union labor
in L03 Angeles was in a state of chaos
and urged that the State Council lend
it a helping hand:
The report of Secretary Tveitmoe of
San Francisco was read and approved.
The secretary spoke of the good condi
tion of the finances* of the council, and
urged the placing of competent men in
responsible places. The convention then
settled down to routine business and
appointed committees to act during the
convention.
ARMOR PLATE
POOL INQUIRY
CHICAGO, Jan. 11â It was expected
the City Council would to-night defi
nitely determine the exact nature of
the alterations which will be demanded
in all Chicago playhouses before they
are again allowed to open their doors
! to the public. The amended building
ordinance covering playhouses recom
mended by the Council committee was
so long and the pressure of. other busi
ness so great that it was decided to
make the matter the subject of a spe
! cial meeting of the Council, which will
be held next Thursday evening. The
main features of the proposed ordinance
probably, will be passed exactly as rec
ommended by the committee. Such of
these features as relate to theaters have
already been published.
A resolution was offered by Alder
man Hunter in the Council meeting to
night directing the Council committee
which has been examining theaters and
department stores to also investigate
the safety of hotels and club buildings,
Having heard the testimony of the
seven chorus men and eight chorus girls
fit the "Mr. Bluebeard" company in re
gard to the fire. Assistant State's At
torney Barnes toc-k a nonsuit in the
cases against them to-day. They had
been held on technical charges to in
sure their appearance at the inquest. \
Ten men connected with the theater
were arraigned before Justice Caverty
and their cases continued until Jan
uary 21. Justice Caverty said that
those who are being held to testify at
the inquest would be released immedi
ately after such testimony was given.
James M. Strong, a witness at the
inquest to-day, testified that he, with
his mother and wife, bought standing
room tickets fc-r the Iroquois perform
ance and were In the first balcony.
When the fire sfarted he left the bal
cony, followed by his wife and mother,
and went to a door, which proved to
be an exit, but was locked. He threw
himself against the door, but could not
force it open, and then reached up
and broke the transom with his fist.
Being unable to open the door, he
pulled himself up and through the tran
som, dropping* on the outside of the
door, where he found a man with a lot
of tools, presumably a carpenter. The
two men tried to break down the door
from the outside, but could not, and
Strong pulled himself up into the tran
som a second time, intending if pos
sible to pull his mother and wife
through the transom. While he was
half way through the flames filled all
that part of the theater, his mother
and wife were, burned in front of his
eyes and he was so badly scorched that
for. several days his life was despaired
of. . â¢ ' . .';..".
It is upon Strong's evidence that the
State's Attorney will largely rely if
an attempt is made to secure indict
ments .in connection with the fire. He
said that not only his own family but
hundreds of other persons could have
gone through this door and been saved
had it not been locked. When he look r
ed through the transom a second time,
he declared, the entire passageway was
jammed with people. ' v
Deaths of two more fire victims to
day brought the total up to 571.

The work of construction is being
performed under the direction of a
commission composed of W. H. Ban
croft, vice president and general man
ager of the Oregon Short Line, and
Chief Engineer Hood of the Southern
Pacific Company, as the representa
tives of Harriman. | and J. Ross Clark
and H. Hawgood, manager and chief
engineer respectively of the Salt Lake
road, acting as the representatives of
Senator Clark.
Chief Engineer Hood of the South
ern Pacific Company, owing to . the
vast amount of work that devolved
on him in the building of the Lucin
cut off and straightening out the line
of the Central Pacific, had little time
to devote to the construction of the
Salt Lake road until recently, when,
with Chief Engineer Â¦ Hawgood, he
made a thorough inspection of the
southe'rn end of the route of . the new
road, over which rails are Â»yet to be
laid. He has made a report in which
are incorporated many valuable sug
gestions, antl it is said that these, will
greatly aid the directors in. arranging
this week for the early completion of
the road.
A meeting of the directors of the
San Pedro. Los Angeles and Salt Lake
road is to be held in Salt Lake City
this week, when it is expected that
the contracts for the final construc
tion work on the new road will be
awarded and definite plans made for
making the through connections from
the latter city to Los Angeles.
It has been frequently announced
that the promoters of the road fig
ured that at least fifteen months
would be necessary to place it in con
dition for operating purposes, but it
is now reported that E. H. Harriman
hns been advised, by his chief engi
neeer,' William Hood, that this work
can be accomplished easily in much
shorter time.
As a result of this report Harriman
has given orders to rush operations.
A year ago, when it was announced
that Harriman was behind Senator
Clark in the building of the San Pe
dro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake road,
and that the transfer of a portion of
the Oregon Short Line to the control
of -the Clark company was simply a
move on the part of Harriman to aid
the new line in getting quick terminal
connections, the Senator was prompt
â¢with a denial of the report. Sinoe
then, however, it has been learned
that Harriman holds more than -. 60
per cent of the new company's stock
and is taking an" active part in all the
arrangements for the completion of
the line into Los Angeles.
Harriman Is Eager to Have the Xew
Line Finished Inside of Ten

The theme of "DanielÂ«in the Lions'
Den" has been taken by Rene Whaite
for one of the most striking animal
paintings that has been seen in San
Francisco in years. Mr. Whaite's spe
cialty is animals, and at Schussler,
Brothers' Art Gallery at 118 Geary
street lions in various attitudes and
involving, many phases of life on the
deserts are displayed with eood effect
on various sized canvases. One of
the pictures is a battle between two
lions. Others are entitled, "Voices of
the Night"- â a suggestive theme,
"Monarch of All He Surveys," "Rulers
of the Desert."" "African Lion" and
"Bengal Tiger."
The work in which Mr. Whaite has
presented his most elaborate and
strongest study is "Daniel in the
Lions' Den." It is an original treat
ment. The tawny brutes, treading
under foot human skulls and bones,
are tactfully arranged to make their,
size and significance apparent to the
prophet, who stands upon the summit
of a fijght of stairs calmly and fully
aware of the fierce beasts below, that
are waiting to ."devour him. While the
hunger and desire of the lions- are
plainly pictured, the face of Daniel
reveals the calm spirit within. The
exhibition will be open daily until the
16th, inclusive.

has not been seen since last Wednes

of no reason why he should have done
so. Kaplan had been worrying about

Judge Mogan had a roast coming for
Dan Shea yesterday. Shoa complained
that a boy named Patrick Sullivan had
stolen his wagon. Shea has an unen
viable reputation and his brother has
been in the County Jail so many times
that the walls are warm with him.
Sullivan, is only about 17 years old and
it was a matter of bad temper that
caused his arrest. He was properly
dismissed on the charge of petty larceny
and the complainant was warned that
the next time he brought a case of that
kind into the police courts he would be
prosecuted for perjury.
Michael Tobin went to bed with a
charitable lodger at the Valencia Ho
tel. He awoke earlier than his com

petty larceny and given six months, in
the County Jail, where "thieves do not

hearing.
Victoria Fuevolow, the woman that
tried to broil 8. child" on a â¢ hot stove,
was before Judge Cabaniss yesterday.
The baby was in court, as also some of
the witnesses who had seen other cru
elties she had imposed on the baby.
Mrs. Fuevolow asked for a further con
tinuance, and her case was set over
until January 19.
Drury further said he would show
that death was due to natural causes
and pointed out that the autopsy failed
to show any arsenic in the kidneys,
liver or other organs, and if arsenic was
the cause of death it must have existed
in these organs.
The witnesses examined yesterday
were Dr. L. D. Bacigalupi, autopsy sur
ceon; James R. Murphy, ex-messenger
at the Coroner's office; Dr. Charles L.
Morgan, who analyzed the contents of
the deceased's stomach; Dr. Carl W.

â¢District Attorney Byington in his
'opening statement to the jury stated
fully what he intended to prove, all
the principal points having been al
ready published in The Call.
Attorney Frank G. Drury also made
a statement to the jury outlining the
â¢Irfense. After detailing the cause of
death he referred to the fact that the
defendant had sent for four different
physicians, none of whom treated her
liufband for arsenical poisoning, but
they all from the beginning prescribed
arsenic, strychnine, morphine and other
poisons*. %
Bowers was naturally a weak and
sickly man, suffering from a number
of ailments and had been under treat
ment for a number of years, Drury
saidr He would show that Patrick
Lorvy was merely a friend and that
Bowers never made any objection to
Lervy calling at his house. Regarding
the alleged forged prescription he said
he would fhow that the defendant did
not write ix nmr did Phe cause it to be
written or filled. She never had any
arsenic in her possession and none was
found at her house. Mrs. Sutton, he
said, never presented the prescription
to be filled as alleged.
â¢"I will show," continued Drury, "that
Harry Bowers h,id been on unfriendly
terms with his brother Martin, neither
having any use for the other. Harry
Bowers \yas in attendance upon Mar
tin Bowers on the Sunday night and
Monday night prior to his death and
went with him in the ambulance on
the Tuesday morning to the German
Hospital, where he died that day.
"Harry left the hospital before Mar
tin died, but sent his wife, Sadie,
and when she reported to him that
Martin was dead he went to the Morgue
and said that the defendant had pois

The tfial of the contest of the will of
the late Isabella D. Clark, the wealthy
young woman who committed sujclde
in the McNutt Hospital some months
ago, was commenced yesterday In the
probate court? before a jury.
â¢ The contest was brought by Alice
Ann Hart and Mary E. Carter, sisters
of the deceased, who ask that the will
be set aside on the ground that Miss
Clark at the. time she made the will,
the day before she tpok her life, was
not possessed of her sound senses, and
that for many years prior to-her death
she had been under the influence of Dr.
W. F. McXutt.^The will bequeathed all
of the $300,000 estate of the deceased to
Grace E.' Strohn, her sister, and named
Dr. McNutt as executor.
The only witness examined yesterday
was Rev. John Hemphill, the spiritual
adviser of the deceased. He testified
that jn his opinion Miss Clark was not
mentally sound, and gave as his reason
the fact that even during her child
hood she was melancholic. He also
testified that he based his conclusion on
her manner of receiving him when he
visited her at the hospital.
Whether the Miners' Union at Hod
son, Calaveras County, or Us members,
have beaten and intimidated non-union
miners on their way to the Royal Con
solidated mines, or whether they have
used moral suasion simply.- was the
problem before United, States Circuit
Judge Morrow yesterday for solution.
Several weeks ago the Royal Con
solidated mines came before the court
and made a showing by affidavits that
strikers were forcibly preventing per
sons from going to work at Hodson.
and a temporary restraining order was
issued by the court commanding the
strikers* to refrain from threats and
violence and from any Interference
whatever with the business and prop
erty of the company. At the same time
Frank Rochester and about one hun
dred and fifty other strikers were or
dered to appear in court and show
cause why the temporary restraining
order should not be made permanent.
The strikers were, represented yes
terday by James G. Maguire and W*.
H. Walker and the complainant ivai
represented by Jesse W. Lilienthal and
Arthur L. Levlnsky. A batch of affi
davits was read on behalf of the de
fendants In which they declared they
had not resorted to violence.
In order to rebut these denials Mr.
Lilienthal produced a large number of
affidavits. In which the deponents de
posed that non-union men had been
beaten and their lives threatened by
former employes of the company. It
was averred under oath that more than
one man had refused to drive the com
pany's oil teams because from wh,at
strikers had told them they feared they
would be ambushed and killed on the
road. It was averred further that non
union men had been intercepted oa
their way to Hodson, had been taken
prisoners by the strikers and taken
out of the district by armed guards.
Mr. Maguire moved to strike out such
portions of the affidavits as related .to
Incidents occurring since the beginning
of the litigation.* but Judge Morrow
overruled the motion. Mr. Lilienthal
stating that the complainants desired
to throw all the light possible upon
case in order to show the methods and
the animus of the strikers.
The case was continued until, next
Monday and the restraining order will
remain In effect meanwhile.
The present spacious rooms of the
Union League Club on the ground floor
of the Palace Hotel, facing New Mont
gomery street, are quite central and
readily accessible and many of the old
time members are opposed to a sur
render of the premises. The report,
however, is circulated that the Palace
Hotel owners will not subscribe to a
long lease, hence there is an active
and growing sentiment in the league
membership favorable to. the acquisi
tion of permanent quarters wherein
modern club facilities may be extended
to resident and non-resident members.
. The annual election of the Union
League will take place this afternoon
and evening. There is no opposition
ticket in the field and at a late. hour
last night there were no indications of
a contest. The following candidates,
comprising the regular ticket, will
doubtless receive all the votes cast at
the election: President, George H.
Pippy; first vice president, S. J. Hendy;
second vice president. H. G. TV. Dinkel
spiel; secretary, J. B. Fuller; treas
urer, I. W. Hellman, Jr.; directorsâ C.
H. Garoutte, F. E. Beck, C. L. Field,
E. E. Gates, John Rothschild and E. D.
Page.
A topic of general interest to the
club membership will be discussed at
the annual meeting to-night.* Club gos
sip is to t:.e effect that Colonel Pippy,
president of the league, will be able
to prese r nt to the meeting a clearly de-'
fined proposition from Mr. Burbank,
the owner of the premises now occu
pied by the Pacific-Union Club. It is
reported that Mr. Burbank has con
sented to the acceptance of plans Â¦ for
remodeling his spacious building: at the
northwest corner of Post and Stotkton
streets, which will permit the Union
League to lease one complete story of
that building.
There was considerable talk some
time ago of Joint occupancy of the
house bv the Union League and the
Press Club, but the discussion never
reached the point of direct negotiation.
It is reported that the new home of
the'Paciflc-Union on the northeast cor
ner of Stockton and Post streets will
be finished by Xovember 1 next. It is
fancied that e remodeling of the in
terior of the Burbank building could
be carried out within two months after
the premises were vacated, hence it Is
predicted that the Union League may
be able to mo j in some time in Janu
ary, 1905.
If the test is satisfactory it is pro
posed to introduce It into the army
at once. The hash is put up in cans
large enough for one day's rations, and
is guaranteed by the packing company
to keep in any climate, no matter how
tropical it may be.
The transport Meade, which has been
laid up so long, will go on the drydock
in all probability. to-day. She is to be
put In first class shape to go to sea.
Bids were opened yesterday for nec
essary repairs to the big troopship. The
expense of pLtting her into commission
will cost Uncle Sam somewhere in the
neighborhood of $50,000. She was orig
inally the old City of Berlin, built in
1874, and afterward known as the Ber
lin. When the Government bought her
at the outbreak of the Spanish-Ameri
can war a big pile of money was spent
on getting her into condition to
meet requirements. She was kept busy
while the war was on. but beins an
expensive ship to run she was one of
the firrt laid up. When under full
speed her consumption of coal is about
150 tons daily.
The cantonment formerly occupied by
the Seventh Infantry Is being put in
fine shape to receive the Twenty-eighth
Infantry, Colonel Owen J. Sweet, due
to arrive here on the Sheridan early
Thursday morning. The Twenty-eighth
will be stationed at the post for some
time to come, unless there should be
war troubles in Asiatic or southern wa
ters, when their services probably
would be required in those directions.
Henry St. Denys Thomason, first
lieutenant assistant surgeon, has re
ported at headquarters for examination
for promotion.
Lieutenant Thomason was major sur
geon of volunteers in the Philippines,
and waj also executive officer of the
large Santa Mesa Hospital in the su
burl - of Manila in the early days of
the Spanish-American war.
The Signal Corps was out practicing
last night with its acetylene lamp
lights. One party was stationed back
on the hilis at the Presidio, and the
other on the grounds in front of the
General Hospital. The practice was
successful.
The passenger list of the transport
Sheridan, scheduled to sail February 1
for Manila, will consist principally of
casuals, but no organized troops are
listed to sail on her.
The report by the men at the Pre
sidio yesterday was that the hash was
eminently satisfactory and every man
ate more than his allotted share. It is
well prepared, and certainly is as ap
pealing to the palate as any home
made hash. It consists of fine cornbeef
and potatoes, with just enough onions
to give it a relish, and is well seasoned.
Its nutritive qualities are deemed to be
equal to the fresh article.
Beginning yesterday the enlisted men
at the post began experimenting with
this diet and will continue the pleas
urable occupation until Wednesday
night- The experiments in the East
were favorable and the troops approved
of the new diet.
The new army hash which has been
suggested by the Government to take
the place of cornbeef and potatoes
while troops are campaigning is now
being given a thorough test at the Pre-
Eidio.

Front streets and the bay. None of the
old offenders know him. As one of the
instances of his career he passed before
a shoe store on Market street and found
a woman and a man disputlngly ar
rayed against the proprietor. His en
trance and power of authority were
strenuously disputed by Jennie Â¦ L.
Thompson, and under duress he was
compelled to take her into custody.
When the hew captain appeared in all
the trappings of his rank in Judge

The three sailors who have been held
as witnesses in the carving operations
of Thomas Turner were dismised yes
terday by Judge Mogan. The carvaree,
B. Hanson, was able to be in court, and
the three witnesses gave testimony to
the facts of the attempted killing. They
have been in the City Prison for nearly
a month. Their testimony was needed
to convict the defendant of an unlawful
use of a caseknife. Lest they should
seek the seclusion of the bounding bil
lows they were held in custody. Judge
Mogan has worried over their detention
until he has lost nearly eight pounds.
It was a glad moment for him when
he was able, under the law, to set the
three sailors at liberty and give them
the wide berth of the sea instead of the
cramped quarters of the City Prison.
Mary Brennan is an advocate of the
boycott. She persists in standing out'
in front of a saloon that refuses her
drinks and declaring it an "unfair
house." Mary was arrested by Police
man Hostetter and appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday. It was shown
by competent testimony that Mary was
habitually Indulging in intoxicating li
quors and generally made a nuisance
of herself around the neighborhood of
her Minna street residence. Judge Mo
gan thought that six months in the
County Jail would be a proper correc
tive measure, and Mary was led care
fully away.
Accordingly he sought her, and in the
process of his search he found a burly
landlord who painfully abused him for
the manner of his entrance. Bradley
had gone through an entrance caused
by himself, which formerly was a .win
dow, carefully forged from silica ore.
Bradley looked like a Swede when
he appeared befofe Judge Fritz yester
day, but his accent and behavior proved
him an Irishman. He- said he had
known the girl for three yeaTs and
was acting on the impulse of newly
acquired information that she was an
occupant of the house In Question.
He said he had no idea of burglariz
ing the house and really did not know
what he was doing when he battered
the wjndow until it fell with a crash
at his feet.
At first Judge Fritz was Inclined to
hold Bradley, but when -the full light
of the love affair dawned on him he
concluded that the defendant was more
to be pitied than censured. According
ly he allowed him to depart on the
promise that three, weeks from-yester
day he would appear and report his
conduct.
"Because he loved her"â with two
minors that should be .clung to like
a boy on a limb over a pool â James
Bradley was arrested on the charge of
attempting burglary. He had placed
his affections on a girl that did not
requite them. Heated with drink, he
concluded to find her. From some
source of information he learned that
she was an occupant of a room at 452
Minna street.

... The scene of enthusiasm was repeated
later on when Mme. Patti again ap
peared. The cheering was kept up until
the, Binger. sang "CominV Through the
Rye." and then again that wave of ap
plause went up in a mighty volume and
would not cease.' Again and again
Mme. Patti returned to the stage. She
kissed her fingers to her, admirers,
J>owed and passed from- sight.
Back on the- stage of the 'opera-house
Mme. Patti was fairly besieged" by
those who had- purchased theV .stage
eeats. The police .officers were unable
to restrain the enthusiasm- of dozens
at women who flocked around the diva
as she was escorted to her carriage, by
her husband, Baron Cederstrom.' , / .
;' A final number by -two, singers of the
company followed Â¦ the exit of Mme'.
iPatti, and 'the concert was over.' *
The vast audience slowly dispersed.
"I have heard Patti again," was an
expression freely used in the lobby,
while there were many that congratu
lated themselves at- having taken ad
vantage of their first opportunity to
hear,the once great singer. Some there
were, however, that quietly, remarked,
"We will' never hear the Incomparable

with a variable quantity. of fun." Had
it been in accordance with the plans of
the Tivoll management to" give "When
Johnny/Comes Marching' Home" as' the
first. attraction in' the new house then
there . ' would have been ; fewer empty
beats' during the first weeks of the
season. ; â¢
Patti threw her arms around two of
the ladies of her company and kissed
them affectionately. -v
One woman who had a little child
of two years in her arms pressed for
ward and held the child ou,t toward
the diva. Pattl took .the little one and
kissed It, making the young mother the
happiest woman in that large audience
of the gentler sex. t\
When Mme. Patti left the stage after
singing her farewell song her eyes were
filled with tears and she greeted a
number of ladies that had gathered
close to the entrance.
The song was indeed the farewell of
the singer whose. silvery tones have
been heard for half a century, who has
won the homaee of many millions of
men and women, who has swayed rul

When the doors of the opera-house

Captain Spillane of the Police De

on hand, and Assistant Chief Dough

a squad of men on duty at the theater.
The policemen and- firemen were, sta

have liked to have been among those

rendered In this city by the famous

The scenery of "When Johhny Comes
Marching Home" should hqt be over
looked. There is a moonlight scene that
was so good that the'audlence applaud
ed it on first sight when there was no
one on the stage; so there was no' doubt
that it, was the sparkling of the moon
light on the river and the fireflies flit
ting about In the dusk of the magnolia
trees that caught the public fancy. In
addition to the white chorus there ] was
a black one arid a regular Southern
plantation "breakdown" on a, large
scale to lend variety and verisimilitude.
In the iine of adhering to the unities
of time the female chorus appeared in
the' first and second acts In full-blown
"crinoline," ' such as our mothers wore
in the days of the *â¬0's and thereabouts.
When thestage.was crowded end the
tiltlve crinolines were pushed about by
dancers, like so many, inflated balloons,
the audience laughed at the, outworn
custom of the good old time' to. its 'full
content. Hartman .had one turn in
crinoline.' -". : â¢
The odd thing about this last scene
was that Hartman actually went into
it with seriousness enough to arouse
the suspicion that he would be a melo
dramatic light ifjÂ»ver his coruscations
and twinklings in the comic arena
should become dim. If there was any
surprise in the performance' Ferris
Hartman furnished It in the scene al
luded to. .
The essence of the story Is that a
newly married Union crmy officer,
brought by a singular train of circum
stances under suspicion as a spy, rath
er than to permit blame to fall upon
his wife or upon her young brother,
who is guilty, goes through a court
martial without telling the truth that
would save hirrfself from peril. Finally,
in the last scene, when the execution
of this officer Is due to take place, a
grotesque character, which is of course
Ferris .Hartman, supplies the excul
pating facts. i
in irum me ensemDie is the thing in
"When Johnny Comes Marching
Home." The solo work is not very am
bitious from the musical golnt of esti
mation,, but (here is a story and . the
acting was well enough* done to carry
to tHe end the' interest that fairly be
gan in 'the second act and to hold the
audience: in* suspense, notwithstanding
that the "argument" as printed In the
programme in advance left very little
to be guessed at. â¢
evening. It was put on with a chorus
that crowded the stage. whenever It was
all concentrated within the compass of
one scene. It not only filled the stage;
its volume filled the house so strongly
that it was' like a first-class imitation
of grand oDera at times.
Mr. and Mrs. Walter Dcaves' "Merry
Manikins" were new at the Chutes yes
terday and made hits at both perform
ances. La Drew and- La Zone, "tHe

lers, society acrobats and equilibrists,
and Luce and Luce, comedy sketch art
ists, also made their first appearances
and were well received. Joe and Sadie
Brltton, the clever colored dancers; Ma
bpj Lamson, the illustrated singer,
and the animatoscope, showing many
new and interesting moving pictures
completed the programme. The ama
teurs will appear on Thursday night. .
Chutes,
The play as presented is strong in
character sketches and as weak in the
heroic as a play could very well be.
But whatever the finical critic might
find in shortcoming in the matter of
scenic effect and stage mounting, it
must be confessed that the character
sketches atoned for all the rest- Adele
Belgarde, as the gossipy Sirs. Lorimer,
was one of the central figures, with
Frances Starr, a winsome soubrette,
as a cheerful foil. There was a little
part in the cast that was cleverly and
conscientiously taken care of, and
that was the Howes of Walter Belasep.
The fault of overdoing was adroitly
avoided. Another sterling bit of acting
was that of the old-time favorite,
Georg? Osbourne. whom age cannot
wither nor custom stale, and the splen
did ovation with which his first ap
pearance was greeted must have been
highly flattering to' him. Fred Butler
should cast himself for a role that "will
keep him on the stage longer than he
remained last night. The audience
couldn't help thinking that the com
pany was materially weakened when
he was made stage director. The
Fletcher of Mr. Conness was good in
Bpots and rather tame in others, and
he seemed to have infected Miss Block's
role of Marian Wolton with the same
peculiarity. Mr. Durkin was appropri
ately dignified as the hero, Douglas
Rhodes, and Maria Howe played ditto
in the character of Mrs. Wolton. The
part, however, did not afford her an
opportunity of doing her special work,
hut dignity sets well upon her never
theless.
The play was the flame, and the
moths were the audience to' see what
little there was to be seen and to hear
a good deal of "The Moth and the
Flame," which began the week last
night at the Alcazar.
Alcazar.
The one Innovation of the melodrama
is that Georgie Woodthorpe smokes a
pipe. Georgie has to be : one. of the
"po' white trash," and she carries her
Missouri meerschaum with an air. but
tt/ thos*Â» who sit In the front rows the
secret will out. She smokes cubeb to
bacco. The smell of it reminds you
of your youthful days, when you used
to sneak behind the barn with the
brave, Imitation cigarettes when papa
was not at home. Besides Miss Wood
thorpe's pipe, there Is Tommy Shearer,
who fills In the gaps with blackfaco
specialties. The gaps demand same
thing strenuous, and he is some of that.
If any person does not feel a shud
der run up his spine at the Central thia
week it is because he, has no spine â
no nerves. For "The Moonshiners" Is
a mod old Morosco play of nerves./
The fact that there are no real pile
drivers or real fire engines is account
able for only because such things
would be out of place In the Blue Ridge
Mountains. They have a r5al villain,
however, and he Is compensation Â»for
the absent piledrlver and the missing
fire engine.
"The Moonshiners" is dangerously
like "In Old Kentucky." with the
horsey part cut cut; it la also, kin to
a dozen other melodramas of the plain
folks stamp. The promiscuous shoot
ing comes In just where such actions
should come. But there Is shooting;
and what would the Central be with
out the smell of powder after the ad
vertising curtain had been dropped?
Central.
The women also are very satisfying,
kathettne Stewart is an elaborately
comical and splendid .person as Lady
Granpler, and - Ina Goldsmith as the
spinster daughter Susannah Is Intelli
gently humorous. The rest as well as
these are well gowned, and the set
tings are solidly beautiful. Not expect
ing too much, one may v enjoy "Mrs.
Deering's Divorce."
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Percy Fendall has made a character
in Mrs. Deering that fits the chief lady
of ks cajst very happily. With the play
as a whole he has not been to success
ful,. The story is of a rather tempestu
ous pair who have too hastily decided
upon divorce. They still love each
other, but think they don't. A year
after the divorce the husband decides
to marry again, a wealthy spinster
with views. He comes amiably to tell
his wife about the matter and finds her
an the eve of receiving a visit from
the wealthy spinster, who is thought
fully coming to look into her future
husband's references. This scene 13
excellently handled by the playwright.
In fact, the whole first act is lavish In
promise. The husband goes to an ante
room while the catechism takes place,
his wife, divided between laughter and
tears, giving him an excellent "charac
ter," that is duly noted down by the
spinster. In the character of the spin
ster Mr. Fendall has again, been fortu
nate, the humorous and pathetic being
very skillfully blended. Deering comes
out after her departure to thank his
wife for her amiable recommendation,
and in five minutes is in the midst of
an affectionate quarrel with her. The
act closes with Mrs. Deerlng's accept
ance of a rich, "silly ass" kind of fel
low, Jimmy Foster, who adores her.
Up to here the play Is plausible and
quite ingeniously compounded. As will
be seen, Mr. Fendall had a meaty plot
to his hand and thus far had skillfully
developed It. Here, however, he seems
.to have become tired. His second act,
containing one very humorous scene
between Captain Deering and his Im
mensely respectable future mother-in
law. Lady Granpler; another between
Mr. Deering, the prospective father-in
law, and Lady Granpier, is sufficiently
funny but unconvincing. Its ...peAple
talk as even the lowest of high society
never talks, and the act ends in a near
approach to what south of Market calls
a "rough house." The third act again
is lightweight, with Mr. Fendall's big
gish opportunities gone a-gllmmerlng.
It takes place In the "parlors" of a
fashionable dressmaking establishment,
wher,e Jimmy Foster, Captain Deering
"and all the rest of the people rather
impossibly find themselves. Still, there
is plenty of entertainment In theÂ»"pla'y
and it is excellently acted.
Capricious^ witty, high-spirited, Mrs.
Langtry Is as Mrs. Deering. There is a
constant suggestion of Mrs. Campbell
in the deep voice, though the nervous,
snappy delivery is very unlike the
suave measures of Mrs. Pat's phrase.
Not less unlike the serpentine quality
of the Campbell movement Is the large,
free, almost gawky gesture of Mrs.
Langtry. It is . a very satisfying as
sumption, her playful fencing with Cap
tain Deering, her scene with the spin
ster, the delightful bit where, listening
to a risque story from the model father
in-law, she sets the couch shaking with,
a laugh that Is the best of Its sort since
Dolly Varden's, all of high comedy or
der. Of course, .Mrs. Langtry's gowns
are charming, a black satin frock In
the Jlrst actâ she Is laughably In
mourning for Captain Deering. white
and glitter in the second, and black vel- !
vet and ivory satin in the third. Curi
ously the actress' "make-up" was dis
tinctly amateurish. '
The support Is of unusually good
quality. Frederick Truesdell as Cap
tain Deering brings a not plausible
part convincingly into the picture. He
is virile, good natured and slightly
scampishâ in the "Man-from-Mexlco"
way, just as the part demands. The
scene between him, Mrs. Langtry and
Mrs. Haydon in the first act Is a rather
remarkable example of stage manage
ment. It goes with splendid zip. Har
lod Mead is the "silly ass" man, Jimmy
Foster, and is vacuously clever. Steph
en B. French is an excellent Lord Gran
pier, with a little overleaping to the
farce comical.
I did not see Mrs. Langtry sixteen
years ago, so cannot say whether the
actress has "retained" her beauty. It
Is, however, a handsome woman, tall,
slim and shouldered like a Juno, that
comes out this time. They gave her
fifty-one years In -the foyer last night,
she doesn't look them by a good ten.
She still suggests, though irregular in
feature, the classic mold of her pictures;
her hair, bronze in its lights, is still
worn in Its graceful, old fashion, and
her bearing Is the same regal habit of
former fame. One thing is changed.
They said she could not act when she
was here before. Mrs. Langtry can act
now.
Stranger here for sixteen years, Mrs.
Langtry last night reappeared to local
ken in a new comedy by Percy Fendall,
"Mrs. Deerlng's Divorce." The audi
ence was large and gowny that greeted
the once famous English beauty, and
would probably have been as large
whatever she had presented. As with
Pattl it is a case of personality, curi
osity and sentiment. Those who saw
her sixteen years ,ago wanted fo see
If the "Jersey Lily" still retained her
beauty. Those who hadn't wished to
see the woman who came first into
prominence by pouring an Ice down the
august neck of the Prince of Wales.
Others again â but whatever the reason
every one was there and the house
crowded.

There was a stageful of audience be
sides the houseful outside, and when the
curtain went up, revealing the assem
bled multitudes like a great chorus,
there was a twitter that became a roar
of laughter. Then, really, these are
good people thai Patti brings.* Signor
Sapio as accompanist is a'host in him
self, discreet, sympathetic and thor
oughly musiclanly. ' Miss Zamels, who
went on atta moment's notice with a
couple of solos in place of Anton Heg
ner, who was ill, again proved herself
a delightful fiddler. She "has, by the
way, Ysaye's own fiddle for â¢ seventeen
years. Her substitute, numbers were
the prelude of. "The Deluge" (Saint-
Saens) and the rarely heard ''The Bee *
of Schubert, that, arranged for the
cello, was to be given by JMr. Hegner.
Miss Zamels'' other number was the
Gpunod-Wiehlawski "Faust Fahtaisle,"
conspicuous for some fine harmonics in
its clear and- fervid rendering. Miss
Margolles was again heard in some
brilliant Liszt, and Mr. Cunningham in
a smooth' and tender. "Liedariden
Abendstern" from Tannhausor. with a
rather unflramatic "I'Pagliaccl" pro
logue as encore. Mr. Virgo's numbers
wore "O Vision Entrancing" and
"Quando le Sera." There seems no par r
ticular xeason for Mr? Virgo to > sing.
An<3 so, and so, the greatest. voice of
the last century has for U3 ggne with
the things that return no mor? and to
the tuno of "The Last Farewell." :Â¦
BLANCHE PART1NGTON.
Schubert's "Serenade" was the next
programmed number, and not striking
ly sympathetic In fact; until madatno
reached the "Home Sweet Home" she
was not at her Thursday night level.
But here she came to her own again. I
suppose no one can sing this old," old
song, that even the whole ba'd band of
barrel organists has failed to kill, as
Patti can still sing it. There were pas
sages in it purely divine, and one cried
out: "Oh, the pity of it, that this thins
can ever die!" As second encore she
gave the "Cotnln* Thro* the Rye"
again'. But there was not in the ren
dering that amazing moment of youth,
that buoyant coquetry that carried thÂ«
thing off so victoriously on Thursday.
The audience was by no means so en
thusiastic as on that famous day. The
applause . was as lengthy, but thinner.
Yet after the last note of the last song
that this greatest of singers will sing
here, it rang out tumultuously. Again
and again the' little lady returnedâ I
heard her say VBless their hearts!" as
she went to bow for the last timeâ and
how, oh, how, we should have loved
her but for that "Last Farewell!"
It spoiled for me all that went before
and came after it. Yet otherwise the
singer was not in so'good voice as on
the first evening. This doubtless wag
caused by the shock attendant on the
railway accident in which the Patti
company was concerned on Sunday.
Perhaps it was in consequence of -.his
that the song happened. The first night
audience escaped it. But she gave us
Handel, the lovely "Angels Ever
Bright and Fair," and with a charm
that is wholly hers. Fearful, after my
enthusiasms of Thursday night, to be
woefully disappointed yesterday, I was
doubly glad to find again that exqui
site, unique vocal quality that is the
essence of Patti's power. One hardly
got it fully yesterday, however, cer
tainly not in the Handel number. It
came more ripely in the first encore,
the favorite Gounod "Serenade." de
liriously phrased and balanced. Miss
Roza Zamels undertook the violin ob
ligato with quick and delicate sympa
thy, and with Signor Saplo's chivalric
support "at the piano there "\wa3 as
charming a bit of ensemble work as
you'll hear this side of Christmas. Ma
dame liked it herself, for she gave Miss
Zamels a sounding kiss as' sha came
off the stage and led the young vjolin
iste to the footlights to share the ap
plause. To this madamegave as en
core the never to be ' sufficiently exe
crated "Last Farewell."' Â» ' .'.
More, the unspeakable name. of Its
perpetrator is upon the programme.
The pong is advertised as for sale In
the foyer. It is further shamefully ac
knowledged to have been expressly
composed for Mme. Patti's farewell
tour. The inference is obvious, and
goes far jo justify those who have
cried out upon the commercialism of
this last visit of the singer. With
Handel, Schubert and Gounod upon the
programme, with all the wealth of Mo
zart andâ to think for a moment of all
there is yet in the Pattl throat, and be
fore a vast audience at least entitled
to common courtesy, the singer's in
troduction of , this unholy, claptrap is
utterly inexcusable.
Qh, Patti, how could you? How could
you?
What have we ever done to you that
you should impose that â¢ miserable
"Last Farewell" upon us? It is a
damned spot that will not out. The
cheapest ballad monger at the Orpheum
has never done worse, the Bowery
never beaten it. The rhyme is atro
ciousâ"real" with "feel," for one shin
ing example; the musicâ save the
mark!â a shrieking banality; the senti
mentâI thank thee for, the word, Wal
lace Brownlowâ "putrid," positively
putrid. And Adelina Pattl sings it
sings it with a stage tear, as she says,
â¢'I smile, but I am weeping." or some
other such gibberish in which the thing
abounds.

and battens. The steamer had violent
pairs and very heavy head seas
throughout, the passage. The greatest
force of the gale was on January 6 and
7. Among the passengers was Melton
Prior, artist of the London Illustrated
News, who is on his way to Japan.
The sea which did the greatest dam
age boarded the Umbria over, her port
bow last Monday, smashing in the front
of the port Bide of the deckhouse and
wrecking the captain's room. The cap
tain's sextant, chronometer and other
instruments were destroyed and the
deck broken so that the water poured
down in the salon." So terrific was the
force of water that the brass port
opening, which received the full force
of the blow, was torn off and the thick
plate glass which covered it smashed.
Four sailors were injured, one of them
seriously. As goon as possible the open
ing was covered by a tarpaulin and
wood braces lashed to the front of the
deckhouse. This was not done, how
ever, before she shipped another wave,
which again flooded the cabin. A third
great sea was encountered on the after
noon of Wednesday, further wrecking
the captain's room and stripping off
the tarpaulin. ' m
Commissioner MeKenzie called the
President's attention to the urgent
need that the colony of Americans,!o
cated at Coldfoot be given reasonable

ernment.
MeKenzie says it is imp6ssible now
to obtain fresh meat in Coldfoot ex
cept that of -wild animals killed in the
vicinity, and that is scarce. Provi
sions of all kinds are high, as on ac
count of the practical impassability
of the trails, it costs $400 a ton to
transport provisions from Seattle to
Coldfoot.

thereby, both in efficiency and in accomplish

PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
No treatment of our public school system
within the limits of an Intelligent economy
can b-_- too liberal. The pres;nt Board of
Education has raised the character or our
schools to a very high standard. I am con
fident that the School Department will re
ceive at your hands Just and fair consider*
tlo::. The Board of Health Intends, during the
coming year, without extra cost to the city,
to provide for the regular sanitary and med
ical Inspection during schcol hours . of all
schools and school children In the city, and
I have no doubt that their work in this
direction will cause better health conditions
throughout the city.
It will also Institute a similar inspection
of t^e factorl?s nnd v.-orkshons of the city
for the protection and benefit of the children,
an we".! as of the adults v.bo toll therein.
ThÂ«se conditions will conduce to create much
better conditions for the tolling masses. The
system of milk and food inspection and analysis
also about to be established by the Hoard of
Health will do much to prevent Infant mor
tality, and will also provide better security
for us all.
The harbor front, of San Francisco should
be under the control of the municipal authori

to achieve this result. No better benefit could

Ordered Hack for Duty.
The Police Commissioners met as a
Pension Board yesterday afternoon
and out of the eight men on the re
tired list who were examined as to
their fitness for active duty only one
was ordered to report to Chief Witt
man. He is Raymond M. Silvey, who.
whUe doing detective duty, was retired
on April 16, 1900. He jofned the force
on February 27,. 1874, and was 55
years of age when retired. The cases
of some others have not been finally
disposed of.
Anthony to Walk the Carpet.
Corporal Abraham Anthony has
been cited to appear before the' Police
Commissioners on a charge of derelic
tion of duty. Anthony was detailed to
find out whether Mrs. Lydia Hume of
Toledo. Ohio, had died in this city, and
where, but he failed to do so and
through his negligence her body was
cremated here instead of being sent
to her home in Toledo for interment.
Custom-House Xotes.
Ramon Arias Feraud Jr. has been
recognized as Consul General for Pan
ama at this_ port. He was recognized
as temporary Consul a few weeks ago.
The services of William K. Hatch as
sampler in the custom-house have
been dispensed with and he has been
transferred to the Los Angeles cus
tom-house as examiner of merchan
dise at a salary of $1500 per annum.
The Secretary of the Treausry has
notified Collector Stratton that the
Venezuelan Government had estab
lished custom-houses at Tucasasand
Cristobal Colon and had reopened
the custom-house at Ciudad Bolivar.
Frederick A. Whitney has been ap
pointed an unclassified, laborer at
$J>40 per annum.
This slackness and lac'.Â» of sysieni have cost
the city many thousands of dollars in ascer
tained defalcations,, many more thousands, un
doubteoly. which have never been discovered,
and additional thousands for expert services
for discovery what in alt probability can never
bs recovered. I^ast year the bills for expert
accountants alone of official books amounted
to over $7C0O.-
In addition to these losses and expenses, the
present system of disorganized accountancy
Involves. thr> employment in the various of
fices of cashiers at good salaries, multiplies
the possibility of losses by error as well as
by intention, and is wasteful and pernicious ln
the extreme.
STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
Under present conditions there is hardly any
check on any' official Â¦ who receives' money If
he makes no entry of It In his books. In sev
eral of the offices several deputies may receive
moneys, and. If not entered, it. can scarcely
be traced. There Is protection neither for the
city nor fcr the citizen who pays. I suggest
that a system be devised of numbered receipts
(something In the nature of. a Wells-Fargo
money order), which shall be delivered to the
respective city officials and charged against
them for their face value, and each receipt
shall thereafter be accounted for by the of
ficial receiving the same.
Notices should be posted conspicuously in
every office that no receipt except the official
receipt should be accepted by any person pay-
Ing in any money. This would safeguard the
city's Interests and would effect a great sav
ing of expense. One clerk In the Treasurer's
or Auditor's office could. In my opinion, do all
the 'necessary cash accountancy of every mu
nicipal department, except as to the collection
of taxes. I respectfully recommend that an
ordinance be framed on the line of these sug
testions.
. I strongly reiterate the recommendation
made ln my first inaugural message, and which
has just been made also by the .Merchants'
Association of San Francisco, that the city
acquire and operate its own street-sweeping
plant, and I see no reason why the city should
not also own and operate a municipal paving
plant. Private corporations find no difficulty
in operating economically and efficiently such
plants, and I see no good reason why the
city should not be able to do likewise.
I shall favor strongly, and I recommend
earnestly, that at least (until the money from
the proposed bonds shall be available for the
purpose and Indeed thereafter) a liberal appro
priation be made for the proper repair and
improvement of accepted streets. Many of
them are certainly In bad condition now. and
the most liberal appropriation posaible under
our charter restrictions will be none too large
for these purposes.
It may be possible that upon proper Investi
gation and regulations enough money could be
realized from the rentals of the spaces under
sidewalks In the business districts now used
and rented for. business purposes to aid mate
rially In the work of repavlng and Improving
such streets. A cursory examination Into tVii.->
matter discloses that many, many thousands
of dollars are annually collected as rents for
sub-sidewalk spares by owners of abutting
lands who have no more legal right to col
lect rent .for the space under -ihe sidewalk
than they would have to collect rent for simi
lar space In the middle of the street: for the
legal street belonging to the city exteeds from
building line to building line and includes the
sidewalk as well as the roadway. Justice, it
seems to me, would require that the city should
receive the rent of Its own property -rather
than that the same should be collected by
persons who have neither legal nor moral right
to receive such rents. I Isy this matter be
fore you for your early consideration. Tli*
city could certainly utilize the sub-sidewalk
space for Its own conduit system Iftthe own
ers of the adjacent properties should decline
to pay a satisfactory rental therefor.
I DISCUSSES GAS RATES. ,
ThÂ« consolidation of the various companies
which have txeii supplying the city, with gas
and electric light has led to an increase in
the price of gas In San Francisco, not at all
justified by the cost of its manufacture and
distribution. The consolidation itself and the
improved and cheaper methods of manufacture.
It sefms to me, should have impelled a re
d'jctlon, â¢ rather than a raise In price; and I
have recently betn Informed by gentlemen who
contemplate the establishing of a 'competing
plant thai a large profit could be r:alized by
the consolidated companies from the sale of
gas at the prices prevailing before their con
solidation. *
Many complaints have come to me lately,
not only of th. high price, but also of the
poor quality of the gas furnished. As it will
be your duty durlnx the next month to fix
the minimum rates for gas and electric light
In this city, I deem It my duty to call these
facts to your attention and recommend that
youtfike action therecn. -
In view of ths many recent fatalities due
to gas asphyxiation, most of which are said
to be due to the presence of an undue propor
tion of deadly carbon monoxide cas, I sug-
S'*t also for â¢ your consideration the advisa
bility of considering the question of restrict
ing, by proper legislation, the percentage of
such monoxide iras which may be permitted
In any gas furnished for Illuminating or fuel
purposes.
ThÂ«> failure of the Secretary of the Interior
to allow the â¢ city the II?tch-Hetchy reser
voir sites in connection with a prop<s?d
municipal water supply has been extremely
disappointing, bet this action will merely
postpone, for a rhort tim*, the problem of
securing for ?an Francisco an adequate
municipal supply of . nure > water for Its In
habitants. There can bs no â¢ question
that such a supply will s ion bo an absolute
necessity. The company now sntplyine the
city is taxed to the utmost to keep pace with
our advancing needs, and may not b*> able,
with Its tireaent facilities, to equal the de
mands of t!-.e immediate future. Everv ef
fort should , b? made to secure, without any
unnecessary delay, p. better and more abund
ant supply. The peonle of this city are en
titled, to pure fresh water, to as much* of it as"
they may ne<d. and at a lower rate than that
which they have- been obltced to pay and are
now paylnc. . 1 recommend that your honor
able board take up the question of acquiring
& municipal water supply as one of the most
serious and important propositions which ; can
come before you. 1 pledge you ,rny support
and assistance toward the achievement of. this
result at the carllert possible time and with
the least possible delay. .
THEATERS TO BE SAFE.
' The appalling disaster which has 1 recently
overwhelmed Chicago, has called our atten
tion to t'.>e possibility of similar danger hire.
While the urecautlons which have In recent
years be*>n taken here have minimized ~ the
risks. It -iP our bounden^ duty .to 'make con
ditions In our theaters and in all our places
of . amusement u secure and 'safe aa human
power and human foresight . can make them.
I was glad to see that your predecessors have
called' for reports and recomendatlons from
the 'various departmental authorities regard
ing', the safety of these places of public re
sort.' Prior, to that actlcn, I had made a sim
ilar-request upon the' departmental officials.
Their reports will soon - be received. whTe
upon I trust that you will take such legisla
tive proceedings as will- render least possible
any. caUstrophe such -as that which has
brought sorrow upon our sister city, r
,1 'wish also to. repeat, a. recommendation
heretofore made by me to' your predecessors
that provision be made in the budget for pub
lic open-air concerts Jn various public squares
of f the city, bringing = clow to the â¢ people of
earning factors of the same community and
pledge themselves to contribute large sums of
money to a common fund for these purposes,
hoping by the liberal use of such moneys to
force a capitulation of the laboring classes to
their prospective demands or present desires,
they are building up Ideas which will eventual
ly not only react upon themselves, bringing sor
row and perhaps ruin to many and danger to'
the city's best Interests, but will also bring
about discontent and industrial strife among
our people, arraying class against class ami
producing conditions the end of which no one
can foresee. I have repeatedly said, and I
have always consistently endeavored to five up
to the declaration, that capital and labor,, em
ployer and employe, should have equal
consideration, equal protection, that cap
ital must have *afe and steady in
vestment In order that labor may
have constant and remunerative employment;
that the Interests of both are for a conserva
tive and friendly recognition by each of the
rights of the other, and under all circum
stances and conditions I propose to abide by
and to effectuate these Ideas, and I will ask
your support in these views for the safety and
security of vested rights, for the progress and
prosperity cf our city, and for the well being
of the Individual citizenship of San Francisco.
Any secret alliance of citizens of San Fran
cisco having such purposes and objects will un
doubtedly become a menace to the advance
ment of our city's material and social Interests
and an obstacle to her Industrial progress. I

time materially increase the potential effi
ciency of the office. This Is but one example
of what may be done. Whenever It may bÂ»
found possible to economize without cnnnlinit
or Injuring the working power of a department
it Is my present Intention to carry out the
same policy. In this connection I submit to
your Judiciary Committee the consideration of
proper legislation to bring all the departments
of the city under municipal control It i"Â«

Early in my term I commenced an Investiga
tion Into some of the matters which developed
flagrantly later In the County Clerk's office
but was prohibited by the courts from con^
tlnulng my Investigation on the ground that
the office was a county office and that the
charter provision giving the Mayor the- rlirht
to Interfere with such offices was Invalid -If
such be the proper construction of the law
then any of the various so-called county of
fices may at will ond with Impunity dissipate
the funds of the city by the employment of
useless and Incompetent clerks and in many
other ways which It Is not necessary "to re
view here. Â¦ Something should certainly bÂ»
done to abrogate the distinction now made be!
twe*n county and municipal offices in this city
where all elected officers derive their office
and their pay from the same source
BUREAU OF SUPPLIES.
CASH .ACCOUNTANCY.
In the same line of economical administra
tion It seems to me that a large and intelli
gently governed city like ours should be ablÂ«
to put Into cfTect a . rt form in the matter of
the purchese and distribution of supplies for
public institutions and departments which
would not only prove more economical but
would render much better service. And this
should be secured, even if it be necessary to
submit a charter amendment to accomplish the
object. No well-regulated private business con.
cern would think . for a moment -of, having a
dozen or more , storekeepers, commissaries and
agents In as many different departments act-
Ing independently of one another in the same
generar direction. A concentration of this ele
ment of. our municipal business in a central
department and Its proper regulation would
effect a rational â¢ saving of thousands of dol
lars a year In salaries and In the purchase,
receipt and distribution of municipal supplies.
I strongly recommend to your honorable board
thÂ» earnest consideration of this suggestion.
Such a bureau would also render possible more
careful supervision, and would "enable the city
to make certain that goods of home manufac
ture and the product of free white labor were
being delivered. at the various Institutions us
called for. , â¢ - . .
My experience and investigation during the
last two year* has convinced me. as It must
convince every one who has considered the mat
ter at; all. that there Is much looseness and
carelessnerj In the cash transactions of -.the
various city ' of flees and departments. '- Â¦
Mayor Schmitz yesterday transmit
ted his annual message "to the Board
of Supervisors. It was read by the
Mayor himself. It was received in si
lence by the Supervisors during its
reading, and no comment was made by
any of them afterward. The message
follows:
Ocntlemen of the Board of Supervisors â Pur
suant to a very agreeable and useful custom
I am pleased now to pn-sent to you my second
inaugural address and bespeak for its sugges
tions and recommendations your indulgent con
sideration. 1 shall depart from the usual prac
tice of presenting a historical retrospect of the
events of the past term, and shall take the
liberty of laying before you a few impressions
and ideas which may be found of public in
terest and benefit and of future advantage to
our city.
THANKS THE PEOPLE.
At the outset, however, I wish publicly and
formally to express to my fellow-cltlzens my
deep sense of appreciation and obligation for
their continued confidence in me, as evidenced
by the flattering and increased majority' by
which they have returned me to the chief
magistracy of the city for a second term. I
shall endeavor to Justify their trust by un
swerving and unending devotion to their inter
ests and to a Just. Impartial, efficient and
business-like administration of the city's af
fairs eo far as the power so to do in me lies,
keeping ever before me the principle of equal
rights to all without distinction of class, or
station, or industrial, religious, political or"
financial stations.
To the retiring members of the Board of
Supervisors I wish to S8y that while they
have not at all times been In accord with my
views or policies, I recognize that they have
throughout their term zealously; and earnestly
acted for what they believed to be the com
mon good, and that they deserve the besÂ«
wishes and the utmost consideration of their
fellow-citlzene. To you, the newly elected
Hoard of Supervisors, I would say that you
will have my earnest and hearty co-operation
In all matters looking to the public weal, and
I truÂ« that I shall receive from you the same
friendly co-operation in similar matters. The
powers which are vested in you are vast and
important. You are to make the law for this
great city, and It Is for you to provide Ite
finances and to apportion and Indeed, in ef
fect, to expend its funds In every department
of its covernment. The proper exercise of
these Important powers will require Judgment,
zealous attention and energetic action on your
part, and at no point will you find me lacking
in most cordial support and assistance.
MAYOK AND SUPERVISORS.
Between the Board of Supervisors and the
Mayor there is such Intimacy, both of official
and of personal relationship, that the recip
rocal attitude of the one to the other should
and I hope ever will be of the most pleasant
and friendly nature^ â In the Interest of har
monious and successful administration.
Petty personal animosities or political dlf
ferencts should not affect ,us on either side
in our a>alinsÂ» with public affairs, and our
action should in no case be determined by
personal feeling or prospective political ad
vantage.
In the last two yean, 1 took occasion twice
to veto what, upon careful examination, ap
peared to me to l>e appropriations for extrava
gant and unnecessary municipal disburse
ments.
Thene vetopa were overruled by your pre
decesfors, and the moneys which might hav-f
bepn saved for street improvements or other
municipal betterments were expended as
originally appropriated. My attention has been
called to come 111 feeling expressed by some
of the members of the preceding board, who
are also members of your board, because of
my notion in that regard. I wish to assure
these centlemen now, as I did then, that on
my part there was naught of personal con
sideration or of personal feeling; It Is my
desire that a similar condition shall prevail
with them, and that they shall harbor no
rcst-ntment for any offlcal action taken In the
public Interest. Antagonism based on such
official action Is always injurious to the peo
ple's interests.- of which we are but the tem
porary trv.stet-s.
For the work which Is before you and for
yourselves. I invoke the utmost succefs and
satisfaction, and for your term of office the
credit and appreciation which goes with hontst
effort and successful realization.
POINTS OUT DAXGEIt.
The past two years have been years of pros
perity and of good fortune for San Francisco.
They have been also essentially years of peace,
and of freedom from violent strife. It Is, of
course, not possible in so short a time to
adjust to an absolute nicety relations between
elements of the community which have for
years been brought to look upon one another
as adveroe. but marked progress has been
made along lines of Industrial peace, and a
better understanding has been brought about
between the two great divisions of our in
dustrial activities, labor and capital, employer
and employe. The differences which have ex
isted between them have been due somewhat
to misunderstanding. - somewhat to misrepre
sentation, and largely to bad and probably
not disinterested advice, on the one side or
the other It has been my endeavor, on every
possible occasion, to create a better under
standing and a better condition between thes.Â»
groat elements of our commercial and Indus
trial prosperity, and 1 am pleased to say that
In almost every Instance I hav* succeeded In
accomplishing that purpose, to the satisfaction
and advantage of both sides. Of course, there
have at times been unavoided petty squabbles,
which for various reasons, have resisted ad
justment; but, on the whole, there has been
a most sattstactory solution of every labor
problem which has confronted us during our
preceding administration^
The hopes of the people have become strong.
Indeed, that during the next two years all dif
ficulties and differences, if any should arise,
can be profrreissively and more readily adjusted
along the lines cf pleasant and intelligent un
derstanding and co-operation between these two
important elements of our people, that the lines
of distinction between them would be dimmed.
If not obliterated, and that in one homogeneous
tody they would go forward together to pro
mote the . eventual and unquestionable destiny
of San Francisco as a leader of the world of
commerce and of Industry, of enterprise and of
achievement. But Just as this picture of ad
vancement and of pride appears upon the hori
zon of our hopes comes the depressing an
nouncement that a number cf misguided men
are Initiating a movement. for the estnblidh
ment <<of an organization which shall disrupt
the peaceful condition which we have striven
for H> long and so earnestly, which will put an
end to the co-operation and mutual good will
which we have sought to create and which will
net up In their stead distrust, dissatisfaction,
discord, class hatred and etrife. How men of
Intelligence and of civic patriotism, men Inter
ested in San Francisco's welfare. In the success
of their own business enterprise, and In the
advancement of their fellow citizens' prosperity
can be go blinded to the results which will fol
low the establishment of such an organization
is .almost beyond comprehension, â¢ ,

City's Chief Executive Makes Numerous Recommendations
for Improvement of Municipality. ,
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a number of resolutions de
signed to improve the safety of thea
ters and other buildings. The first or
dinance aims to regulate the use of
aisles, passageways and stairways in
theaters and public halls, and Â¦ was
passed to print., It forbids any person
during a performance to sit or stand
in any aisle, passageway or stairway.
A resolution requests the Board of
Fire Commissioners to idvise whether
the fire limits should not be extended
and over what streets or parts of
streets such extension should be made.
The Board of Public Works and the
Fire Warden were requested by reso
lution to make a written report on
the condition of all hotels, hospitals
and lodging-houses with respect to their
safety against danger from fire. The
first named board was requested to
make a report of the number of such
buildings, their locations and the dates
of their erection.
The chief of the Department of Elec
tricity was directed to report on the
condition of the electric wlring"of thea
ters and public halls and other public
places of amusement.
ISLAIS CREEK PLANS.
The Board o* \Vork3 was requested
to give information as to what steps
have been. taken by it and the Har
bor Commissioners in compliance with
a resolution recently passed to have
their engineers prepare a plan for the
improvement of Islais Creek and
Swamp District in order that the same
may be used as a barin and harbor to
accommodate the growing commerce of
the city.
The ordinance declaring the length
of the main track and the assessed
value of the /United Railroads as fixed
by the State Board of Equalization was
indefinitely postponed in view of the
City Attorney's opinion that the city
would surrender its right to assess the
corporation within the limits of San
Francisco if the ordinance is passed.
The Union Oil Company was granted
permission for a period of sixty days
to maintain a spur track already con
structed on Illinois street. The Board
of Works is to prepare a map to deter
mine the lines of the property of the
company located on Illinois street.
TO EXTEND AVENUE.
An ordinance was finally passed ac
cepting a deed from M. A. Fritz to
land for the extension of Tremont ave
nue. â¢
The roadway of Bartlett street be
tween Army and Twenty-sixth was
fully accepted.
The recommendation of the Board of
Works that prevision be made in the
next budget for the widening by eight
feet of the roadway of Mission street
from East to Ninth and for its rc
paving with basalt blocks on a con
crete foundation and a binder course
was adopted.
' The property owners on norland
street between Church and Sanchez
petitioned the board to place an ade
quate main "in the block named and to
erect another lamp at the corner.
The petition of citizens that the
Health Department be authorized to
issue permits to bury the ashes of cre
mation in the various cemeteries was
referred to the Health Committee.
The Board of Supervisors, by a votÂ»
of 14 to 3, yesterday overruled Mayor
Schmitz's veto of the ordinance tak
ing from him the power of appointing
a poundmaster and placing it in the
hands of the board. The vote on the
proposition whether the ordinance
should be finally passed notwithstand

denstein. Braunhart, Comte, Connor.
d'Ancona. Eggers, Hocks, Lunstedt,
McClellan. Payot, Rock.
Xoes â Bent. Finn, Rea (3).
The passage of the ordinance, in
effect, removes Quinn from his posi
tion, but the Mayor intimated that ths
matter would be contested in court.
The Finance Committee has recom
mended that the pound be placed un

for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals.
The joint Committee on Finance.

or. The report resents the assertion
of the Mayor in his veto message tlmt
the ground of objection to Irwin's ad
ministration "is claimed to be his us
ing'on occasion when on the road un

â¢ "That is a complete mlsstatement
that was doubtless involuntary. The
Mayor's statement that he believes
that the public pound has never been
better or more fairly administered
than by the Incumbent is astounding
in view of the testimony of Sam
Pearce. one of Irwin's deputies, who
testified that he had pocketed money
to allow animals to roam at large."
The report repeats the testimony of
John Partridge, who said the Mayor
had informed him that the pound was
being admirably conducted by the So
ciety for Prevention of Cruelty to An
imals. The Mayor agreed to appoint
a man Selected by the society, but
when the man went to the Mayor hÂ«
was informed that another would bÂ«
appointed. y
MAYOR PASSES THE LIE.
"The statement attributed to Mr.
Partridge I notv denounce as a mali
cious lie," said the Mayor. "It seem*
to me that if any evidence was intro
duced at the committee's investigation
personally reflecting upon me I should
have been notified to attend the meet
ing. I never had any conversation
with Mr. Partridge on the subject. The
only one whom I spoke to was Mr.
Holland, who agreed to accept Irwin
as poundmaster if he would work for
$75 per month, but afterward refused
to do so." . ;
"You may denounce Mr. Partridge
as a perjurer," said Branden3tein,
"but it is a fact that he testified under
oath and bears an excellent reputation
in this community, but the point here
involved is that Irwin has proven to
be incompetent and his administration
is inadequate and the pound is loosely
run." : . -

The Board of Public Works is mak
ing preparations to carry out a plan
of reorganization similar to that put
into effect last Saturday by th,e Board
of Health, which will result in nearly
100 subordinates losing their positions.
These will include a large number who
are not under civil service and quite a
few who are presumed to be protected
by the merit system.
The sweeping changes contemplated
by the Board of Works will' be made in
all probability at to-morrow's meeting,
or at a special meeting to be held at
a later date. Commissioners Schmitz
and Woodward have been in consulta
tion with the Mayor and are arranging
the details for the proposed wholesale
removals.
There are 140 positions not under civil
service and a large majority of these
w-ill be declared vacant and successors
appointed thereto who were open In
their advocacy of Mayor Schmitz's re
election. Among those of the class men
tioned whose tenure of office is in jeop
ardy are City Engineer Grunsky, City
Architect Cuthbertson and Gas Inspec
tor Tui.cr, whA will be succeeded on
January 31 by Thomas Eagan.
TO MAKE OTHER CHANGES.
Other changes contemplated will be
in accorl with the policy of retrench
ment of Mayor Schmitz as expressed in
his message to the Board of Supervis
ors, in which he vetoed certain specific
appropriations of salaries for positions
which he considers unnecessary.
The positions that will be directly af
fected, together with the yearly sala
ries attached to them, are as* follows:
One clerk in the general office, $1500;
one messenger, $900; one stenographer
and clerk of the bureau of buildings,
$1500; one clerk in the bureau of streets,
$1200; three clerks, bureau of streets,
$4500; one keeper in the corporation
yard, $900; two carpenters at the cor
poration yard, $2100; three inspectors,
bureau of architecture, $3900; certain
employes in the bureau of engineering
not specified, but considered unneces
sary by the Mayor, $10,000.
TO REDUCE SALARIES.
Several subordinates whose salaries
were increased by Commissioners
Casey and Manson without authority
from the Board of Supervisors are like
ly to suffer a reduction to the original
figures.
Among the changes that will be made
will be the deposal of eighteen janitors,
who will make way for a similar num
ber made ud of one man from each of
the various Assembly districts. There
are thirty-four janitors in all employed
by the board, leaving sixteen more
places to fill. v
The Board of Supervisors adopted a
resolution introduced by D'Ancona pro
viding for an investigation by the
joint Committee on Finance, Civil Ser
vice and Health of the proceedings of
the Board of Health in removing civil
service employes without cause. The
resolution follows:
Whereas. At itÂ» meeting, held Januarv 9.
19l4. as reported by the press, the Board of
Health adopted resolutions abolishing posi
tions filled bv officers appointed from the
eligible list certified to by the Civil Service
Commission after competitive examination, no
charge* whatsoever having been filed with the
Civil Service Commiwion. and no opportunity
having been given to said officers to be heard
In their own defense, as required by the
Charter, section 32, article 13. which reads as
follows:
"No deputy, clerk or employ* In the classi
fied civil service of the city and county, who
Â¦hall have been appointed under said rules,
shall be removed or discharged except for
ca.u?>e. uoon written charges and after an op
portunity to be heard in his own defense. Such
charges shall be investigated by or before the
Civil Service Commission, or by or before
eeme officer or board appointed by the Corn
imfstoiier! 1 to conduct such investigation. The
finding and decision of the Commissioners or
rach investigating officer, or board, â¢when ap
proved by the Commissioners. 6hall be certl
fiej wÂ» the appointing officer or beard, and
?hall be forthwith enforced by cuch officer.
Nothing i:i this article shall limit the power
of any officer or board to suspend a subordi
nate for Â¦ reasonable period, not exceeding
thirty days": and
Whereas. The Board of Health established
fimilar tuitions with similar duties, appoint
ing thereto persons not on the eligible list
n.r eertfled to bv the Civil Service Commis
sion; and
VIOLATES THE MW.
WhTfaj, The abolition of an office on th?
classified civil service list and the recreation
of wjrti office under another title is a flagrant
viulation of the letter and the spirit of the
< ivil t^rvico provisions of the charter, and a
i-ubtci-fu;je by which the merit system Is re
r!a'** > d by the uikjIIs s-ystem, and must â¢â¢â¬.
I'^nd-'mneii unqualifiedly and checked In its
un-ipi<Mi<y by the supervisorial power of the
city government; and
Ulirrpas. The violation or evasion of the
r ivil t^rvicc provisions Is an assault upon
the fundamental principle of the .charter,
which every municipal officer must support;
and
Wlif!-eaÂ«. All political parties, through their
party platforms, have unequivocally and un
Â¦-'.Â»â¢!> declared in favor of & strict cn
fon-emÂ»nt of the civil service provisions of
thÂ» charter to which all the elected officers
are pledged: and
Whereas-, Paid civil service provisions are
th-- f=ure?i guarantee of an honest and eco
nomical expenditure cf the moneys to be de
rived, from the sale of the. bond* recently
voted by the iÂ«?ople; therefore be it
nrsÂ«o!vf><l. That it be and is hereby declared
to be tlie fcenee of the Hoard cf Supervisors
that, white it will encourage an economical
ndniiiTit-tration of the city government, and
will Fvpport all the departments in the con-
of positions and the abolition of
OCfloM when thf efficiency of the service is
not tfw>r<=by impaired, it will use every lawful
method to prevent the violation or evasion of
thÂ«* civil service provisions of the charter, to
th" end that the merit eystem may be perma

our riunlcl;al government; and be It further
TO MAKE INVESTIGATION'.
IlesoHed. That the Finance Committee and
the Committees on Civil Service and Hospital
and Health be and they are hereby directed
Â»Â¦> investigate the proceedings of the Board of
Health, and in the event of the verification of
dK report.' of the proceedings of the Board
of Health, tu advise this board what action
i-hould be taken to prevent the violation or
evasion of the law by said Board of Health.
"The throat of civil service has been
cut by these proceedings," said D'An
cona. "and this investigation should be
directed toward ascertaining if civil
service employes can be removed and
their places filled under different titles
by men who perform the same duties."
Protests were ftled with the board by
several civil service employes who were
removed from their positions against
what they term the' unjust and illegal
act of the Board of Health. The pro
tests recite that at no time have the
protestants been charged with official
misconduct or with violating any rule
of the Health Department. The abol
ishing of the position is alleged to be in
violation of the rule of the Civil Ser
vice Commission providing that when
ever it becomes necessary to reduce the
number of permanent employes the em
ploye last appointed shall be laid erf
first. The protest concludes:
niLE IX FULL< FORCE.
"Said rule was in full force and effect
at the time of the act here complained
of. â¢ â¢ â¢ Said acts are subversive of
the principles of civil service and a pal
pable and willful \*iolation of the merit
system provided in the charter."
The protests were referred to the Joint
Committee on Finance, Civil Service
and Health.
Ex-Secretary Emery of the Health
Board verbally protested against what
he characterized as a flagrant, violent
and willful violation of the civil service
law. Emery said that the plea of econ
omy raised by the Mayor Is a pretense
and a sham, and pointed to the aboli
tion of the positions of dislnfectors as
a menace to health and nothing less
than a. vile crime.
"If the statements are correct a crime
has been committed," said Braunhart,
"and there is a power of removal high
er than that of the Mayor. The Inten
tion of the Health Board Is so plain
that an escape from the Home for the
Feeble-MInded could see through it." t
"This resolution means something,"
said D'Ancona, "and if the facts are
verified it commits this board to appro
priate action."
â¢The investigation will be taken up at
2 o'clock Wednesday, and all employes
who lost their positions ana the mem
bers of the Board of Health and others
interested will be subpenaed.

O EVERAL happenings at the City Hall yesterday served to add interest to the affatrs of the
O municipality. The first was the annual "message sent to the Board of Supervisors' by
Mayor Schmitz. In his message the Mayor recommends that the business of the city be con
ducted on lines of rational economy, and expresses himself in favor of reducing the number of
city employes zvithout impairing the efficiency of a department. He submits to the Judiciary Com
mittee the consideration- of proper legislation to bring all the departments' of the city under mu
nicipal control He says it is shameful that the abuses that have existed in the County Clerk's
office should be allowed to continue zvithout the right of interference by the , municipal authori
ties while the city pays the cost of the administration :of such offices. He recommends the creation
of. a bureau of supplies to enable the city to purchase goods of home manufacture and the prod
uct of white labor for the * various institutions of the city: He calls attention to 'the looseness and
carelessness in the cash transactions of the various city* departments, and makes, other recommen
dations, .which will be taken up by the Board 'of Supervisors at the proper time.
The Board of .Supervisors decided to begin an investigation into the alleged violation by
the Board of Health of the civil- service laws in abolishing certain positions under its control, de
claring others vacant and appointing thereto men zvho are not on the eligible lists. The Demo
cratic members of the board zv ere outspoken' in zvhat they term a crime against the - merit sys
tem. The joint committee on Finance, Civil Service and Health was directed to summon zvit
nesses and probe the matter to .the bottom. The fact that the Board of Public Works is pre
paring to put into effect a retrenchment policy on lines similar to that inaugurated by the
Health Board renders the situation acute, as the merit system is directly involved in the proceed?
ings. The power of the appointment of the poundmaster zvas taken away frofu the Mayor by the
passage of an ordinance over his veto, and will result in the removal of Poundmaster Irwin, the
Mayors-appointee.

A GENERAL ADVANCE.
latter part of this series before touching
on Â« any of the variations from the
hard-and-fast rules governing the
manly art. Do not deviate from any of
these rules until correct boxing has be
come second nature to you. Do not,
above all. allow tricks of slovenly or
awkward carriage and motion to creep
into your work; nor imagine that, by
such tricks, you are forming a style all
your own. For you are not. You are
merely weakening your attack and de
fense.
Individuality in boxing does not con
sist in ignoring established maxims,
but in improving on them. And no one
who is not a thorough master of a sub
ject can hope to improve on that sub
ject.
What I shall now teach, therefore, is
only for the use of students who have
advanced to a degree of skill justifying
its use. If you are a beginner cut out
this "lesson (not in the slang sense of
the term) and save it until you are suf
ficiently skillful to warrant you in
studying it.
Nearly every professional boxer has,
by dint of many experiments, laid out a
style of his own. I shall outline sev
eral of these styles, together with-some
blows invented by the best modern box
ers. If you find any of the attitudes
available in your own personal case
adopt them at discretion. You will, in
any event, find the blows easy to learn
and most effective against men - ho are
not acquainted with them.
When Fitzslmmons first fought Jef
fries for the championship of the
world the former expected to meet a
man taller than himself and trained
with that idea in view. To his sur
prise he found himself confronted by
a. man Aho stood scarcely five feet in
height, a man who crouched awkward
ly instead of standing in the conven
tional attitude.
Jeffries, though six feet two inches
tall, was in such a position as to take
at least twelve inches from 'his stature.
His great left- arm was stretched out
almost straight in front of ""him, his
feet much farther apart than the ordi
nary eighteen inches (yet not so â¢ far
apart as to prevent quick motion), the
heart and wirfd drawn back by reason
of his position and further protected
by his right hand, which was held near
his body, his chin drawn in close
among the powerful -neck muscles, the
hard, bony forehead being thus 'made
the most prominent portion of the head,
the protruding left shoulder adding to
the protection afforded to the vulner
able jaw point
Small wonder that this utterly
unique attitude confused the , veteran
Fitzsiramons! .
The first time I boxed with Jeffries
I was familiar (by sight) with this
famous "crouch," yet I found It most
confusing. The advanced left arm,
swift and accurate of motion, met and
stopped nearly every rush. Wind and
.heart were out of reach. Swings
glanced off his left shoulder,' and such
straight blows as reached the 'jaw
found it protected by a mass of throat
muscles, into which it had receded. On
such occasions as I was able to break
-through his left guard I usually found
his right hand ready. The odd posi
tion further braced, and steadied his
great weight (he stripped to 218) and
the left hand, being. held palm down
ward,-was able- to. shoot up or down
with incredible speed- .
Altogether, the man's . posture : ren
dered him almost impregnable. -.-..-
The light revealed the face of a man
well known In the neighborhood by the
name of "Henpecked Sam." ' . 4
"Well, I'llâ. Say, what are you doing
here " angrily shouted the officer.
"I live here," gasped Samâ as the
officer's clutch had not been a light
oneâ "I promised my wife I would be
home at 10 o'clock and it's now after 12.
I was just trying to make a sneak."
On his hands and knees, along a long
dark, rubbish littered passageway
crawled the officer. Visions of medals
galore decorating his manly bosom
were running through his mind. "1*11
get a medal, store," he soliloquized, sub
duing an oath' as his knee struck the
sharp edge of a tin can and he felt
his "inspection day" trousers \ tearing.
"The Chief will surely make nie a
'plain-clothes' man for this."
The passageway was long and the
officer was indeed brave to. venture the
trip, especially with the knowledge thai
somewhere in . the darkness ahead
lurked the crouching form of a man,
who only a few minutes before had
stealthily, and almost noiselessly run
into the passage.
Foot after foot crawled the officer,
bent upon' doing his duty and doing it
well. Suddenly he arose, andÂ« with a
sharply uttered "Surrender!" grasped
the feet of a man who, intent upon his
task of climbing up a water pipe that
ran up the side of the building forming
one side of the alley, apparently did
not know of the officer's approach.
With a thud both men came to the
ground, the officer on top.
"What the ," came with a gasp
from 'the figure underneath.
"I'll show you}?' puffed the officer,
grasping his prisoner by the throat,
and, after considerable fussing, striking
a match. \* - .

A GROUP of Yale alumni have just launched a re-
educational movement whose object is
no less than the establishment of a branch of
Yale University in the city of Changsa, capital of the
province of Hunan, China. An association to foster the
project, with President Timothy, Dwight at the head of
it, has already raised $17,000 and has the promise of suf
ficient funds in the near future to insure the success of
the new college. Already a young graduate has looked
over the new field and pronounced the sentiment of the
higher classes in Hunan to be strongly favorable. High
officials of the Government have guaranteed the im
munity of the school from the attacks of the reactionary
counselors in the imperial court.
The establishment of an affiliated branch of Yale Col
lege in China will mark a distinct advance in the educa
tional spirit and tendency of the times in the Emperor's
domains. China is waking up. Her wise men" are Be
ginning to see that if she would maintain her integrity
in these grasping times she must have the wisdom of
her foes, who hedge her about on every side. Perhaps
a few of the very far-sighted ones see that it needs only
the touch of knowledge to brush away the clouds of.the
centuries and make China one of the powers of the earth.
Just as soon as the Flowery Kingdom feels the prop of
her own trained minds under her and can do away with
the artificial support' which has to be paid for into the
pockets of \ Europeans will she become a nation of inde
pendence and progressiveness. /
Fortunate it is that the scheme for education which
the Yale association has mapped out for their guidance in
the college project is not founded, upon the missionary
idea. Our proselyting in China,- worthy though the
cause may be, has not been an unqualified success. -By
a fair-minded person it even can be seen where the Box
ers had some' justification- in believing themselves in the
right. To the average Celestial mind it appears, and
with good excuse, that knowledge of a strange deity
must accompany the priceless learning of the West. In
their determination to eliminate all idea of the mission
spirit from the working scheme of their college the Yale
alumni have approached their task Jn the manner which
best* promises success. â¢

Captain T. D. E. "Wilson, superin
tendent of the Occidental and Oriental
Steamship Company, has developed a
grouch on the subject of politeness as
practiced in street cars.
"No woman ever manned a strap
while I occupied a seat," said Wilson
yesterday, "but hereafter they can
dangle till they drop and they'll find
Wilson taking his full nickel's worth of
seat."
Now, CaDtain Wilson is the soul of
chivalry, and a declaration of this kind
sounded strange to those of his hearers
who Jcnew the courtly nature of the
speaker. He explained: *
"Coming down town on a -Haight
street car the other morning I was the
only man passenger. I had ridden most
of the way swinging on a strap, but
just before we turned into Market
street two girls feot off and I dropped
gratefully into the space their going
had left.
"I was barely settled, however, when
a stout lady accompanied by a fat hus
band and 'leading a vicious looking bull
dog boarded the car. The lady glared
at me. I got up, bowed toward the va
cant seat and resumed my strap.
"The 'thank you' that never came
was hardly expected after the glare,
but I certainly never looked for what
followed. ... , ~ Â¦ ' . . ' .-"Â¦ I"
" 'Jump, Brutug,' I heard the lady
gurgle. There was a growl, a scratch
ing of feet and a gentle thud. When I
turned my gaze toward my lost seat
there sat Brutus, licking his ugly chops
contentedly, while his' mistress patted
the beast's head and looked affection
into his bleary eyes.
"The other passengers showed some
Indignation at first. They glared at the
woman, stared at the dog and then
turned their glances up to me. A pret
ty girl smiled. - A grin broadened a
face across the aisle. A chuckle sound
ed behind me, and when my eyes again
swept the faces of my fellow passen
gers they vÂ»ere all grinning: I felt the
blood mount to both cheeks. A mist
dimmed my eyes. The lines of C*ees
became the smiling mouth of one big
Cheshire cat, with that, bullpup grin
ning in the foreground. One look was
sufficientâ I left the car. After this
Wilson keeps his seat." . ; ; /.

DOUBTLESS the merchants and the manufactur

better. than any one else, but there are certain re
sults made evident in official statistics of trade which
point to the conclusion that however, well they may
know their business they have not been very dilligently
attending to it. The Call has published figures showing
how our trade with -Alaska and the Philippines has
lagged in comparison with that between those countries
and the Sound* ports, and'hasahÂ»o published the com
ment of leading commercials men' on the subject: Taken
together the two form a very instructive lesson. They

various objects of recent years, we are Still, in some
very important respects, maintaining -our proverbial "in
difference to fate," and are patiently waiting for destiny
to bring fortune to us without exertion on our. part.
In commenting upon our lack of a due share of the
trade with Alaska, .one of our most prominent merchants
said very blandly: "Alaska will buy in San Francisco what
it can obtain here at better advantage than anywhere
else, and will probably buy nothing more." The saying
shows an attitude of indifference to ! the whole* subject,
for it evades the real issue in the fcase. The vital point
in commerce is to supply markets to better advantage
than any competitor and to make the purchasers in those
markets aware of the fact. Who is, to determine what
goods Alaska can obtain to better advantage in San
Francisco than elsewhere? Surely our merchants and
our manufacturers ought t,o have a voice in the determi
nation, of such questions.
Trade advantages are of many kinds and are by no
means solely dependent on natural advantages. Men of
enterprise and courage can overcome less energttic
competitors, even though the latter have many natural
advantages. The Alaskans will buy in San Francisco
whatever goods the San Franciscans can offer them on
better terms than any one else, and with- our superior
capital and prestige on the coast we ought to be able to
capture and to hold most of the Alaska trade for years
to come.
One thing is certain â he who tries for nothing will
win nothing. Only by entering actively in air the com
petitions of the world and the time can San Francisco
attain the N commercial eminence for which her position
with relation to the Pacific Ocean commerce, of the.
United States entitles her. We have at present an op
portunity to make a special exhibit at the St. Louis Ex
position and should exert every energy to display one
that will compel attention and command admiration.
Such an exhibit would go far toward instructing' all visi
tors to the fair, and through them a much wider circle of
business men, as to the nature and variety of the many
articles that can be purchased here to better advantage
than elsewhere. That would be doing something at
least to hold our trade and to extend it; while if we do
nothing, the Alaskans and the. Filipinos will never know
what we have to offer or why they should trade in our
market at all.

Jeffries' Boxing Style.
BT ALBERT PAYSON TERHUNE.
(Athletic Expert New York Evcnins World.
Author of "Muscle Building:," etc.)
(Copyright. 1904. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Every boxer has a style more or less
his own â a style of defense, attack and
pose, into which he gradually drifts or
which he has planned out as most ef
fective for a man of his build and
Bpeed.
It is not well for a beginner to as
sume any particular "style," He
should rely wholly on the positions, mo
tions, etc., prescribed by his boxing
master. The regulation attitude and
movements are far better in every way
than any novice can mark out for him
self. They are the outcome of decades
of study and experience, and he must
indeed be a most conceited youth who
thinks he can improve on such tactics.
For that reason I have '.raited until the
President of the Confederation, he will
assume direction of the foreign affairs
of Switzerland. He took a large part
In framing the Slmplon Tunnel Conven
tion, and much is expected from hi3
conduct of the various commercial
treaty negotiations.â London Globe.
The Federal Government has loosened its pur.se strings
and through its generosity we are to have an immigration
station to cost $200,000. No better addition to the na
tional service in this city could be suggested. It will more
than repay 'if s cost by removing from San Francisco the
imminent danger of contagion from the Chinese detained
in that. worst. of Â¦biillpens on the Pacific Mail dock.
IN our big sister city there is raging the battle of the
palms, brought on, we are persuaded, by The Call's
' articles on the use of palms as a street tree. A pro
fessor in the university lifts his pen against the palm. To
him it is a pest. He looks upon it as Shylock says some
do upon the harmless, necessary cat. He wants the
streets lined with elms, which shed their leaves and^half
the year scud under bare poles. As this is a winterless
land, and he is from a winter country, he desires to give
a winter aspect to our cities. f
Byron says "the cold in clime are cold in blood," but
Californians are not that kind. As our climate permits
the presence of summer glories all the year, ,we want
the good old summer time, all the time, in our street
trees as well as in our temperatures.. To set out trees
that are bare in what are winter months by the almanac
is to despitefully use our climate. It is ours and we
should make the use of it.
California is the semper idem and semper virens State.
At this moment travelers from the East over the Central
Pacific see ripe oranges on the trees in Placer-County,
from Clipper Gap to Rocklin. If the ideas of our anti
palm professor were. applied, the people "of our gateway
county would strip the orange trees of their yellow
fruit and evergreen leaves, so as â¢ to make the^ winter
worn Eastern folk feel at home! So, likewise our mer
chants should display in fronf of their stores arctic over
shbes, sleighs, cutters, bobsleds and other snow-gbing
vehicles, and quantities of ice skates. Such an exhibi
tion would imply frequent snow and much ice.
Our climate is free from thunderstorms. We do not
dodge the lightning. If Olympus had been here, Jove
would have thrown bouquets instead of thunderbolts, for
he could not have found a thunderbolt with a search
warrant. But in the East they must have the protection
of lightning rods and lightning insurance _ companies.
Again, applying the theories of the professor, we should
ignore the thunderlessness of our climate, and invite the
lightning-rod man here, and put up rods on our houses
and barns. If the Eastern man cannot sing the songs of
Zion in a -winterless land, should we dress in fur gar
ments, cut down our evergreens, salt the green grass of
our lawns, rebuke and behead the January bloom, all to
immerse him in his accustomed gloom?
The cause of the palm in Oakland is upheld by a citi
zen, Mr. Bell. He has absorbed the cheer of California
sunshine, and rings like a true joy bell. We doubt
whether a dirge could be got out of him. He sees the
enormous value of our climatic- asset, and proposes that
we get a dividend out of it by using palms for street
trees. He wants no bare and cheerless limbs, to take all
the pleasure out of our sunny welkin. He does not be
lieve that Eastern people come here to find what they
have at home. If they did, they would save railroad
fare and huddle against their base burners, curse the
coal man. listen to the gale whistle in the bare trees, rub
their chilblains and shiver and srieeze from October t<}
April. He believes they come here to escape all that, to
get away from the ground hog, and come where they can
hear the meadow lark and robin in February. There
fore, he wants to give them* in everything the contrast
they seek. He would line our streets with" tropical trees,
which find that nature here is no stepmother, and flour
ish as in their natural habitat. He would lift up our
palms to make oath to our winterless climate, and there
in he is wise.
We would regard it as a distinct injury to any Califor
nia city to fail to use climate in tree setting. Florida
advertises herself as the land of the pine and palm. Rail
roads going south have their "Palm Limited" trains to
carry tourists to that ague-smitten peninsula. But the
palms are there, lining the streets, and they are an at
traction which offsets the lack of zest in the Florida cli
mate. How would it look to advertise California as the
land of the red oak and water elm? Yet that is just what
the professor desires to do. By their trees ye shall know
them, may be said of California cities. We hope that
sunny Oakland will not be known as "the pity of the
wintry trees." ' . . Â¦ â¢ \
T'AKING a comprehensive view ,of California the
most striking fact presently observable is that pros
perity 15 widespread. This is well. The good for
tune of one section is the benefit' of all others in this
State, common interest and common destiny being theirs.
Not long ago this. paper called attention to the large
transactions in real, estate in this city during the year
1003. The total consideration for properties sold was
more than $47,000,000. The significance of this may be
made more apparent when it appears that the. large sum
was more than double the entire value of the mineral
output of the State in the preceding twelve months, the
latest period for which any complete statistics are avail
able. Â¦ : ';Â¦:': .- .,, '
While San Francisco advanced in all material things
the same good fortune attended Los Angeles, Fresno,
Stockton, Sacramento, San Jose, Oakland and its sister
communities' on the east 'shore of the bay of San Fran

made returns through the medium of the local news
papers.
Special editions of the publications'. of the interior have
given many interesting facts. "The ' valley towns and
cities are particularly to *the, agricultural con
ditions obtaining in; the country of ''which they are local
centers of trade and enterprise. So it, follows that if
towns and cities thrive in California- the proof is accept

but are steadily advancing. The same applies to mining.

Whence Coincs Fertility?
BY G. FREDERICK WRIGHT. A.M.. LL.D.
(Author or "The Ice Age in North America,"
"Asiatic Rubsia," etc.)
(Copyright, 1904, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
It hardly needs saying that in general
the prosperity of a nation is dependent
upon the fertility of its soil. In some
few cases, it is true, nations may pros
per because they have a monopoly of
mines, of manufactures, or of the means
cf trade and commerce. But the larger
part of tlte things whicn minister to
the necessities and the comforts of
mankind are the direct products of the
soil.
The relation of the soil to the under
lying rocks, however, is dependent upon
the action of transporting agencies
which are at hand. Where there are
no transporting agencies sufficient to
carry away the disintegrated particles
as fast as they accumulate over tHe
surface we have what is called "resid
ual soil," whose character will partake
entirely of that of the underlying rock.
If the underlying rock is a conglom
erate or sandstone the residual soil
will be composed of nothing but sand
and gravel, whtch is capable of sup
porting only a limited variety of veg
etable life.
But even such soils are not without
their higher values. When Professor
Lesley was asked why the Lord made
those long stretches of unproductive
sandstone rocks separating the Lehigh
River from the Susquehanna and ex
tending in a broad belt across the en
tire breadth of the State, he replied
that, in the first place, they were useful
in holding the world together; and, in
the second place, in providing the vast
populations on either side" with pure
water and pure air, the two most val
uable gifts the Creator has to bestow
upon men.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The celebrated Wyoming Valley on
the Susquehanna, the Shenandoah Val
ley in Virginia and that of the upper
Tennessee are illustrations of that ag
ricultural wealth which is supplied by
the disintegration of limestone rocks.
In numerous places in Central Penn
sylvania, as in the mountains south of
Williamsport, there are limited out
crops of limestone over which have
sprung up flourishing communities sur
rounded by barren sandstone moun
tains, as islands are surrounded by wa
ter in the isea.
The blue grass region of Kentucky is
similarly situated, being bordered by
barren outcrops of Devonian subcar
boniferous conglomerates- and sand
stones, while the thin covering of soil
resulting from the disintegration of the
Silurian limestone supports a vegeta
tion which furnishes the elements most
necessary for the best development of
cattle and horses, and so in consider
able measure accounts for the pre-emi
nence of that region In those depart
ments of industry, it would not be
strange, also, if the pre-eminence
claimed by the Kentuckians for the
beauty of their women and the strong
physique of their men were due to this
gift"frbm nature of a- richly endowed
limestone soil.
But so limited are these deposits of
rock' containing the concentrated ele
ments of fertility that an undue por
tion of the world would be barren If
it were not that nature Is provided
with elaborate means of transportation,
whereby the richness of one section is
carried to another, resulting in a com
mingling of elements, which is of the
highest advantage. During the long
geological ages water, ice and air had
been engaged , in transporting and de
positing in distant regions the residual
soils which were accumulating thou
sands of years before man came upon
the scene. The flood plains . of nearly
all rivers are rich in agricultural pos
sibilities because they Have brought to
them the elements of soil supplied by
the entire river basin. The Mississippi
Valley from Cairo to the gulf is a de
posit of pediment to which the whole up
per portion, extending from the Rocky
to the Allegheny Mountains, has "fur
nished its quota, and so it is with
nearly all the larger river systems of
the world.
The Nile, the Indus, the Ganges, the
Yang-tse-Kiang and the Hoang-ho fur
nish ! old flood plains of great extent,
where aRricu -re has been carried- on
for, thousands of years with little de
terioration of the soil. The vast plain
of Eastern China, through which the
great canal wends its way, is little else
than the combined delta of the two
great Chinese rivers.
In the northern part of Europe and
of the United States and in the south
ern portions of British America gla
cial . has been the plow and the har
row and the scraper which have pre
pared the region for its most successful
occupation by man. The northern part
of the United States is living to a con
siderable extent upon the richness of
Canada. Everywhere down to the lim
its" reached by the Ice of the glacial
period Canadian bowlders are found,
mingled with, the finer grist of-Cana
dian rocks which was ground off from
the highlands by the ice and carried
in its movement south for hundreds
of miles. A European expert has
taught us how to enrich our soil by
grinding up the granite rocks, contain
ing a large amount of feldspar (which
is the basis of clay) and other elements
of value, and spreading It over, the soil.
An eminent authority in the United
States recently asked me if we could
not accomplish that purpose in' the
United States by grinding up the Ca
nadian bowlders. The answer at hand
was, nature has already performed that"
work for us. The Ice movement of
the glacial period ground a large part
of the elements it. brought with it to
finest powder and spread it far and
wide. .It is estimated that on an aver
age the .deposit .of glacial grist over
the northern part. of the United States
is 100 feet thick. .When I had nearly
completed ; the survey of the glacial
boundary in Ohio' twenty- years ago^I
chanced to meet Professor W. I. Cham
berlain, the accomplished i secretary of
the Board of Agriculture, and showed
him the" line -across the State. â¢ He at
once remarked that that line separated
the more-productive agricultural por
tion of the State frpm the least pro
ductive. Taking down the . reports , by
counties, it appeared that the counties
in the glaciated area produced, on the
average, Â¦ twice as much per acre under
cultivation as did those south of the
line. BgaftHKSSH

While talking with some friends the
other day a well-known Jurist remarked
that not very long ago he was strongly
tempted to commit the crime of kid
naping a child. The jurist is a married
man, but no olive branches have ap
peared to bless his home.
"About R o'clock one evening," he
said, "a policeman called at my house
leading by the hand a pretty little girl
about 3 years of age. She was able to
tell her name, which was the same as
mine, but did not know where she^ lived.
The officer brought her to my 'house
thinking she might belong to me. I
happened to answer the doorbell, and
when the little thing saw me she said,
as her eyes swam with tears: 'Am I oos
Mttle dirl?' I said, 'Why, of course, you
are,' as I picked her up and kissed her.
She put her arms around my neck and
hugged me, and my heart filled with a
joy it had not experienced for many a
day.
/'I told the officer to leave word at
the police station that if any one in
quired for the child she would be found,
at my house. When I carried her into
the parlor my wife was met with the
same tearful query from the little one,
and she smothered her till I became
jealous. The child was soon quite at
home, and I began to regret having ad
mitted to the officer that she did not
belong to me and pcay inwardly that
her parents would forget all about her.
My prayers were useless. "We had just
finished dinner when the child's mother
called and took away a blessed ray of
sunshine that had come into our child
less home."

his way to visit his wife's parents, who
reside at 375 Fell street, and had
reached the corner- of Octavia and
Fell streets when three young hood
lums accosted him and asked him for
a match. He offered them his match
box, when they immediately sur
rounded him and told him to hand out
his coin- The request was emphasized
by one of the gang drawing a pistol
and telling him to '"shell out, and shell
out quick, or you will get daylight let
in on your brain."
Helsner produced the $3, which the
hoodlums grabbed, and then marched
him up the etreet to a dark corner,
where the thug with the gun struck
him above the eye, leaving a deep cut.
The whole affair of the holdup took
place Just opposite a grocery store,
which waa brightly lighted at the
lime.
â¢ Heisner had $50 In gold secreted in
one of his Inside pockets, which the
thugs overlooked. He says the thugs
were tough-looking cunstomers, and
would nol Etop at any deed to gain

lucky to have escaped as easily as he
did, and is congratulating himself that
ho was not more seriously injured.
Eugene E. Cerf had a similar ex

his way to his home, at 1155 Octavia
Ftreet, and had got as far as the
corner of Post and Franklin streets,
when two men suddenly appeared be
fore him, pointed pistols at him and
ordered him to disgorge. Their de
mand was made in an ugly way, so
Cerf reached down and produced 60
cents, stating that it was all he pos
sessed. The thugs then tore his coat
o,pen and relieved him of 53 in gold and
his geld watch and chain.
. At this juncture a man appeared,
coming toward the trio, eo the thugs
forced Cerf to walk between them up
the street, threatening that if he made
the slightest outcry they would shoot
him on the spot. When the man had
passed out of sight, the thugs told
Cerf to -make himself scarce," and get
up the street as fast as possible, or he
would get a dose of cold lead. Cerf

- The Hibernia Bank officials stated
last evening that Purcell's accounts
were straight and that so far as they
knew there was nothing to prompt him
to destroy himself. Â¦>â¢>..
Purcell came to the United State3
about eighteen years ago as a mem
ber of the famous English-Irish team
of eleven athletes. They won more
than 60 per cent of the contests in
which they participated and appeared
in the principal cities of this country
and Europe. Purcell was at that time
in the excise department of the city
of Dublin. Later he located perma
nently in San Francisco and was
quickly identified with the athletic
sports of the Pacific Coast He be
came a member of the Olympic Club
â¢and as^a hurdle runner, jumper and
hammer thrower he won many medals
and had few equals. He also took an
active interest in the affairs of the
Gaelic Athletic Association.
Purcell's family consists of a wife
and four children. He is 37 years of
age. v^tj-

own life. She explained that not long
ego he spoke to her of a> clerical ; er
ror in his accounts at the Hibernia
Bank, which had caused him much
annoyance and brought on a repri
mand from one of the, bank officials.
This occurrence, Mrs. Purcell said,
appeared to worry her husband and
he would constantly refer to it His
eldest son, a' boy' of 16 years, asserted
that of late his father had often passed
him on the street and on the ferry
boat and would fail to recognize him.
Another source of worry to Purcell,
it is said, was a severe cold that at
tacked him nearly two years ago and
annoyed him greatly. He feared that
the trouble would eventually develop
into consumption.
JOHN PURCELL, WELL-KNOWN ATHLETE AND BANK CLERK,
WHO SHOT HIMSELF THROUGH THE HEAD AT HIS HOME IN
ALAMEDA YESTERDAY WHILE TEMPORARILY DERANGED.
A romance,, which had its origin on
the Atlantic Ocean, . reached its happy
climax on the shores of the Pacific yes
terday when two young guests at the
Palace Hotel quietly embarked on the
sea of matrimony. The early morning
train from the East brought to this
city Gerald Groesbeck, who promptly
registered himself from New York.
Later there arrived at tne same hog
telry a handsome young lady, who
shyly inscribed on the hotel register
the name and address Miss Lena Lutz
of Boston. . That the Palace had been
prearranged as the common destination
of the young persons was immediately
suggested by the fact tnat Groesbeck
was on hand to creet Miss Lutz and
this formality over they hurriedly ad
journed to the. Turkish room for a short
consultation.
A few minutes later Groesbeck was
on his way to the City Hall, wjiere he
procured a marriage license and re
turning to the Palace he was joined by
Miss Lutz on a hurried trip to the
Hotel Pendleton, where, it had been
learned, Rev. Dr. Rader was paying a
visit to some friends. Arriving at the
Pendleton Groesbeck called Dr. Rader
to the parlor and confided to him that
he and his fair companion were anxious
to be married at once.
Dr. Rader, after a conference with
his friends, secured the use of their
apartments for the ceremony, and ten
minutes later Mr. and Mrs. Groesbeck,
with their newly made acquaintances,
were on their way to a down town
French restaurant, where a wedding
luncheon was ordered. Last evening
the happy young couple returned to
the Palace, but remained there ohly
long enough to gather up their belong
ings and settle their bills. Groesbeck
instructed Dr. Rader to forward the
marriage certificate to the Nevada
Bank, and remarked that he and his
bride would probably spend their early
married life in London.
Groesbeck is well connected in New
York In a business way, but his family
is said to live in London. His bride
is a daughter of a prominent merchant
of, Boston. According to the story re
lated by Groesbeck to a fellow traveler
on the train which brought him to this
city yesterday, he first met his bride
on an Atlantic steamer.' The acquaint
ance led to a courtship by mail, and
finally' resulted in the wedding cere
mony in this city yesterday. Suspicion
that possibly the young couple had
eloped from the East had its only foun
dation in the fact that they came so
far West to get married.

and a 1 large quantity of illicit brandy
that had been made in his. distillery
was discovered by the revenue officers
in a barn belonging to Constant near
Novato. The distillery and stock were
accordingly confiscated and sold for

NOTES OF THE TRACK. ;
Glenwood's work on birds was the
redeeming feature of the day's work,
which was in all rather discouraging,
owing to an oversight of Trainer Lu
cas, who failed to have C. E. Wor
den's pointer dog, Sandlewood, on the
grounds. The running of the stars,
Rod-Sandlewood, heat was postponed
until to-morrow morning, and W. W.
Van Arsdale's English setter bitch,
Keepsake, handled by Charles Bab
cock, and W, B. Coutts' pointer dog,
Glenrose, handled by Charles Coutts,
were put down where the preceding
brace was taken up. Both dogs show
ed excellent speed and range, that of
Keepsake being especially good. This
bitch is the smallest competitor in the
trials, scaling less than twenty-five
pounds, but she runs with surprising
ease and grace and reminds one of her
famous dam, Champion Peach Blos
som, whose recent running in Eastern
trials is still fresh In the memory of
field trial patrons. I
The pointer, too, proved himself a
good one, and together t,he dogs work

tory. Just before crossing the rail
road track to where birds flushed in
the preceding heat had taken refuge
in fine, low grass cover, a- number of
birds were flushed by' spectators, al
though the dogs had ; run over the

flushed ahead of her, while Glenwood
showed his training by rooding care
fully on the scent of running birds,
finally ending with a stanch point,
which Bab backed for a few moments
when she moved up. Dodge flushed
the birds and shot and both dogs were
steady.
Sent after birds which had scattered
on a knoll covered with alkali weeds,
Bab rooded to several birds, which
she flushed as soon as she located
them. Glenwood soon secured an
other point, holding it well and being
steady to shot. Bab finished up the
heat by running over several more
birds, after which she pointed mo
â¢mentarily and then went to a flush.
Aside from her unsteadiness on game,
which may be corrected by more, ex
perience, she is a promising bitch and
should train on to make a good one.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 11.â Favorites
divided honors with outsiders at Ascot
Park to-day, but the winning first
choices were all at almost prohibitive
odds and there was light betting on.
them. The result wts that the books
held a goodly balance in their favor
when the programme was finished.
The initial race' was a surprise to the
talent, Toto Gratiot, at 10 to 1, beating
a very ordinary field. Effervescence
was second and Evander, the favorite,
third.
Peggy Mine was held at 4 to 5 for
the two-year-o!d dash. There was a
strong play on Melar, which was back
ed down from 3 to 1 to 8 to- 5. Peggy
Mine won handily, Melar second,
Woodclalm third.
Another strong favorite, Eugenia B,
at 1 to 2, won the third race at five
furlongs. Ocyrohe was second. Lady
Usk third. Ocyrohe was played down
from 20 to 1 to 15 to 1, then drifted
back to 20 to 1. He ran a good race.
The fourth race, a mile selling event,
went to Henry Clay Rye, at 8 to 1. Lu
nar, the strong favorite, was second:
Greenock third. Taxman was played
for a killing, but in rounding the first
turn was interfered with and dropped
out of it. He pulled up with a bleed
ing leg.
Blissful looked to- be such a sure thing
for the six furlong race, the fifth on the
card, that only a few books put up any
odds against her. Those that did held
her at 1 to 4. She galloped home in
front of Neko, which was two lengths
in front of Buccleuth.
The last race was an ordinary field
of platers, with Ultruda the favorite.
Canejo won by a nose from Ultruda;
Schwarzwald a nÂ£ck behind the sec
ond horse. Jacob Holtman did the

"Young Corbett" and Jimmle Britt
will fight before the Colma Athletic
Club the first week in March. This club
last night offered 76 per cent of the
gross receipts, with the guarantee of
$15,000 to the young pugilists. Jim Neil
and Albert Brandon, representing the
Colma Club, will place a certified check
for $15,000 in the hands of Referee Ed
die Graney on Wednesday night, when
the two boxers meet to sign articles.
It Is safe to say that It is about the
quickest work that has yet been done
in that line in this city. It took just
five minutes to make the deal. Both
fighters were more than satisfied, and
grasped at Neil's offer of a $15,000 guar
antee in a flash. So rapid was the
work accomplished that the old timers
gasped at the lightning manner in
which the work was done.
At 9 o'clock Jimmy Britt and his
brother Billy were on hand at Harry
Corbett's to consider the bids already
posted. "Young Corbett" was at
Fischer's Theater enjoyinff the first
night of the new production^ "The
Beauty Shop." He promised to be at
Corbett's at the end of the first act.
but didn't show up. He sent word that
he would not arrive until 11 o'clock.
Britt was anxious to close .the deal,
and "Young Corbett" was sent for and
arrived shortly afterward. He acted
for himself.
"We'll give you 76 per cent of the
gate receipts, with a guarantee of
$15,000.'' said Jim Neil.
"What's that?" "Youns Corbett"
quickly asked. "You'll guarantee us
515,000?"
"That's what I mean," said Neil.
"I'll take you," said Corbett, and.
turning to Britt. "Is that satisfactory
to you. Jimmy?"
"Perfectly." answered Jimmy.
And the deal was made.
After arguing for a few minutes
about the posting of the money and
about forfeits, it was agreed by the
bidders for the Colma Club to post a
certified check for $15,000 in the hands
of Eddie Graney at the time of the
signing of the articles. Albert r randon
gave his check for $1000 as a guarantee
that he would have the mt.iey ready
Wednesday night. Britt and "Young
Corbett" each agreed to a Xorfeit
of $2500 that they would be on hand
on the date which is yet to be set.
< To-night Billy Britt will meet "Young
Corbett" and draw up the articles. The
previous understanding that the winner
take 65 per cent and the loser 35 per
cent of the purse will undoubtedly be
adhered to.
Much speculation as to the ability of
the Colma Club to arrange accommoda
tions for the large number of sports
that will attend the fight was rife.
Judd Gibbs, manager of the Colma
Club, says that he will have the pavil
ion at Colma in good condition to seat
a $27,000 house. New flooring is n#w
being put in and the place will receive
a general overhauling. The prices of
seats will range from $2 to $20.

The other "special match," that be
tween Harry Tenny and Joe* Troy, did
not last a round. Tenny started after
his opponent like a wild man and
dropped him to the floor with a wicked
right on the point after they had been
fighting less than a minute. When Troy
arose at the count of five Tenny waded
in again and drove his right into Troy's
stomach, dangerously near if not be
low the belt. Troy went to the floor for
the count at any rate, and Referee
Hayes gave the fight to Tenny.
The fight between Dick Hyland and
Tom Sullivan was won by Sullivan,
though the best he should have re
ceived was a draw. He was so much
taller than Hyland that the latter had
to jump to reach his jaw. Sullivan kept
him from reaching it with any effect
during three rounds, but in the fourth
the little fellow, who had won the sym
pathy of the crowd by his gameness
and willingness to try the big fellow
at any sort of fighting, landed with fre
quency. When the judges decided in
Sullivan's favor the spectators hooted
and yelled and hissed, and when Hy-
Jand left the ring he was given three
hearty cheers for his gameness.
The fight between Lew "Powell and
Jack Moran was fierce from the start
to the finish. They are both willing
fighters and clever ones and gave an
exhibition worth traveling a long way
to see. Powell appeared to be the
stronger of the two, but he was not
near as stiff a puncher as his oppo
nent. It was anybody's fight up to the
third round, when Moran caught Pow
ell a stinging right on the Jaw and
sent him to the floor. Powell was
dazed and when Moran landed three
straight lefts in the same place he was
plainly in sore straits. He lasted out
the round, however, and came up
Ftrong for the finish. U-:';
iloran was cool and collected and
clear-headed and opened up the round
with another straight left that dazed
Powell. Then they both mixed it and
for the rest of the round the ring was
not big enough. They did everything
but bite and kick, and when the gong
sounded the' finish were in the center
of'the ring fighting away like mad,
though Powell was not any too strong.
The judges decided, however, that he
was the winner, much to the disgust
of the crowd, which yelled and hissed
and called Foley and Everett all sorts
of cheats.
The KiÂ»ecial match between William
Duffy of the Hayes Valley Club and
Dirk Cullcn of the Relmont Club was
the tamest affair on the card. The
nidges decided that Cullen was the win
ner, notwithstanding that Duffy did
all the leading and forcing during the
four rounds. More than once Cullen's
habit of shirking the issue caused the
crowd to hiss him.
The second fight, that between
George O'Brion and "Mike" Conway,
nas lively from the start to the finish.
Everything seemed to be coming
O'Bripn's way until near the end* of
the third round, when Conway cut
loose a swinging left thaWtook all the
flptit out of his stocky opponent and
rhdrd the battle.
The first fight was between Harry
Williams, a Palace Hotel bellboy and
i member of the Hayes Valley Club,
and George Raymond of the Bay City
Club. Williams had the fight from the
start, and when the second round still
had five seconds to go Referee Milton
Hayes stopped it and pave the fight
to William;?.
The four-round bouts arranged by
Ihe Bay City Athletic Club and pulled
off last night at the Pavilion Annex
were all good fights, but they were
spoiled by the decisions of Judges Har
ry Foley and Fred Everett. At least
two of the fighters, Dick Hyland and
Jack Moran, were wrongfully deprived
of the winner's prize. The place was
packed to the doors and the crowd was
not a bit backward in showing it* dis
like for the judges' opinions, particu
larly when they gave Lew Powell a
decision over Jack Moran.
A stop was now made at Gosford's
ranch, where lunch was partaken of,
after which J. W. Considine's English
setter bitch Hick's Bab, handled by
Coutts, and the Stockdale Kennels'
pointer dog Cuba's Glenwood, handled
by . Dodge, were taken several miles
west of Gosford's and put down on a
wide expanse of open territory con
taining nice cover and ran forty min
utes. This was one of the best braces
of the day, both dogs ranging out fast
and wide and quartering nicely to take
advantage of the cool northwest wind
which was blowing. The setter, showed
a slight superiority as to range, al
though that of both was excellent, and
both made nice casts to likely ground,
which indicated the possession of con
siderable bird sense. In speed they
were about equal, while in style Bab
excelled, as Glenwood was inclined to
lain with a rather low head at times,
which detracted somewhat from his ap
pearance. !;^V"
At the further end of the field the
dogs commenced making game and
after working out a little bit of cover
in a hole crossed the railroad track
and commenced rooding on foot scent
of running birds. Bab proved un
steady on a portion of the bevy, which
After a short run of five minutes a
bevy was seen running from cover to
more open ground, whence they flushed
when the handlers and dogs came up,
taking to some trees which skirted the
field. An attempt was made by spec
tators to force the birds from their re
treat while the dogs were being worked
over the field, but it was impossible to
drive them to good cover.
Cuba's Cottonwood, a pointer dog
owned by the Stockdale Kennels and
handled by N. M. Dodge, and Charles
C ggins* English setter bitch Miss Nel
scn, handled by Lucas, constituted the
third brace, and were put down in a
heavy cover along a dry slough bed.
Soon after starting Cottonwood ran
through a bevy which was hiding in a
dense growth of high grass, and al
though, the birds flushed in all direc
tions he failed to catch scent of the
bevy and passed on down the slough
bed. Both dogs showed nice action,
with fair speed and range, but came
in to their handlers quite often, which
may be accounted for by the nature of
the cover through which they ran. Both
were stylish in their way of going, but
unfortunate as to further opportunities
op birds. They ran forty minutes.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 11.'â The twen
ty-first annual trials 6t the Pacific Coast
Field Trial Club were commenced here
this morning under conditions none too
favorable for high-class work. An early
start was made for the grounds, located
some eleven miles southwest of Bakers
field, and the first brace of dogs, con
sisting of Charles Coggjns' English set
ter dog Sharon Boy, handled by J. Lu
cas, and H. W. Keller's English setter
bitch Sombra. handled by W. B. Coutts,
were cast off in open territory, rather
devoid of suitable cover, a^nd ran fifty
minutes. Sombra showed a superiority
in speed and range, running well to the
end of her beat without letting up in
her search for birds, and showing con
siderable bird sense. Sharon Boy moved
rather heavily in comparison. Soon
after starting a bevy flushed wild and
took to the trees, where they remained
until driven out by some of the field
trial attendants. Sombra rooded on
foot scent of the birds after they had
flushed, and Sharon Boy, coming up,
drew to a point, but discovered his er
ror and moved on after holding it a
few moments. The dogs were then
worked across a large extent of terri
tory containing many alkali deposits,
and when brought back to a patch of
weeds where a few birds had hidden
lost their scenting powers and were
unable to locate the birds, the majority
of which were flushed by spectators.
The second brace, consisting of J. E.
Terry's English setter bitch Countess
Lou, handled by Coutts, and B. J.
Baum's English setter dog Starlight
Jr., handled by Lucas, were taken to a
new location and ran thirty minutes
without any results as to bird work.
Lou showed best in range and speed,
while Starlight Jr. had a slight advan
tage as to style. In speed and range
he was somewhat constricted, and suf
fered somewhat in these respects when
compared with his bracemate.

There was no trace of the light down
pour of rain, and the track could not
have been better. The attendance was
excellent, the books did a thriving busi
ness and four public choices landed in
front.
On form Pure Dale, the hard luck lit
tle Puryear r> gelding:, looked best of
the eleven starters in the opening sprint
at six and a half furlongs, and closed a
mild favorite, backed from 3 to 13 to '5.
The Miller and Flyer were the next
most fancied. At the start Hildebrand
lost no time in going to the front with
Pure Dale, and rating his mount well
put him over the line half a length
ahead of Yellowstone, a 7 to 1 chance.
Emily Oliver, a 15 to 1 shot, ridden by
Foley. led out Our Pride for the show.
It looked, like stealing lead pencils
from a blind man getting 9 to 5 about I
Know to win the six and a half furlong
spin, and the mare won at leisure. She
closed at 7 to 5, and Hildebrand, who
had the leg up, took matters as quietly
as if seated on the back of McChesney.
He 'was pocketed for a time, but got
through three-sixteenths from home
and* downed Louis Wagner, with con
siderable "to spare. Rollick, under poor
handling, finished a good third.
Only a nose separated the favorite.
Glendenning, and Escalante, the Patten
entry, at the finish of the Futurity
sprint, fourth to be decided. The race
had a most open look, and Mimo, Jane
Holly and Scotsman, besides Esca
lante, were all well supported. Larsen
nursed Glendenning along superbly,
and holding out a pound or two for the
pinch outflnished Waterbury, astride
Escalante, receiving a nose decision.
Jane Hojly led- Mimo out for third plr.ee
honors. Scotsman ran an inexplicably
bad race, considering the fact that
Speculation on two-year-old events is
always brisk, and the one decided at
Oakland yesterday was no exception.
Betting had not progressed long before
It became apparent that Meada, a black
fllly by Figaro-Afamada, â¢ owned by
Blanchi & Co., was the real hot one.
The ring was deluged with coin until
the little Miss closed almost equal
choice with M. A. Powell, the favorite
on form. Meada did well for a begin
ner at the game, but could finish no
closer up than third. The winner turned
up in Salable, a 98-,pounder, ridden by
Crosswaite. which not only galloped in
first, ahead of Ragamanda, at odds of
25 to 1, but at the same time equaled
the California record of : 41^ for three
and a half* furlongs. M. A. Powell ran
fourth. .

annual convention here a few days
ago. The fraternity was founded in
San Francisco* on March 10, 18S2, by
R. H. Webster and six other San Fran
ciscans. The most important work of
the convention was the adoption of &
plan which forms the chapters into
districts. Portland was selected as the
meeting place for the convention ln

present, including delegates, and se

The efforts of the executors of the

case came up for hearing yesterday in

for the third time to enable the exec

Andrew Clunle. one of the execu

in the way of the compromise. He. is
perfectly willing 1 that - the widow
should get part of the residue of the
estate, but he does not want her share
taken out of . his half. He' will agree
to any amount the widow asks, but
with the understanding that he
should not be made to pay more than
his oro rata. the percemta^e to be

Union Lumber Company at Fort
Bragg, were run over and killed by
one of the logging trains last Thurs
day. Morrow and Collins had been in

two cars of logs were released to run
into the mill yards by. gravity. The
two men were caught under the

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â Bids for
the Philippine friar lands bonds were
opened at the State Department to-day.
The highest bid for the purchase of the
entire issue of $3,000,000 was from Har
vey Fiske & Sons, associated with
Fiske & Robinson, and the * National
City Bank of New York. Their figures
were: For all or none "of the bonds,
$107,577; or for any part of the
bonds, $105.57. There were eighty bid
ders in all, and much higher figures
were offered for smaller lots of the
bonds.
The greatest part of the proposals
were from individuals who offered to
take anywhere from $1000 to $50,000 of
the total loan. Some of the bids were
from the South and from New Eng
land, but none from west of Omaha.
The difficult task of scheduling the va
rious bids with a view to ascertaining
the best terms offered can be completed
and the result announced to-morrow,
it is expected.
The impression in the Insular Bureau
is that the Harvey FIske & Son bid of
$107,577 offers the best rate, considering
that the firm offers to take all the
bonds at that figure.
This figure undoubtedly is lower than
the bonds at first were expected to
bring. It was stated at the Insular
Bureau that the state of the money
market, a general downward tendency
in Government securities and, more
than anything else, certain limitations
placed on the availability of these Phil
ippine bonds in. connection with their
use by the banks which were not im
posed in preceding issues, prob
ably have acted to keep down the bids.
However, it' is said thÂ£t the figure pro
posed was in excess of the estimate of
Wall street financiers.

CARSON. Nev., Jan. 11.â The Su
preme Court of the* State of Nevada
to-day handed down a decision on the
eight-hour law, sustaining its legality.
The opinion is written separately by
the three Judges of the court. Judge
Fitzgerald and Judge Talbot sustain
ing the law, while Judge Belknap dis
sents. '
The law was passed during the Leg
islature of 1902. It provides that it shall
be unlawful for any party, company
or corporation to work men in mills,
mines or smelters for a period of more
than eight hours in twenty-four. The
law was attempted at the Legislature
of the session before, but was beaten
by a few votes. At the session of 1902
it passed almost unanimously.
Shortly after its passage an arrest
was made in Gold Hill, the object being
to test the constitutionality of the law.
In the lower court the law was declared
unconstitutional and was immediately
appealed to the Supreme Court .of the
State.
The case has been in the hands of the
Judges for over four months, and its
final decision meets the approval of the
unions that carried it to the higher
courU Attorneys on the other side state
that the law will now go to the Su
preme Court of the United States. They
intend to push the issue to the final
Judgment. Â»

were also present -, Rev. E. W. Darst.

Sorrow 'occasioned by the death of
Dr. J. N. Beard prevailed at the regu
lar weekly meeting of Methodist minls'
ters that took place at Epworth Hall
yesterday morning.
It had been the Intention of the min
isters to listen to a paper on "Ritualism
In the Methodist Church" by the Rev.
Mr. Oxnam, but owing to the loss of
their friend It was determined as on the
previous week to dispense with the reg
ular programme.
Almost every one of the big gathering
of divines arose and offered tender
tribute to the memory and -worth and
Christian manhood of the late Dr.
Beard. ;
The Rev. A. C. Bane, who was with
Dr. Beard at the time of his sudden
death in. St. Louis, told the assembled
ministers of the passing away of their
friend and colleague.
The Rev. Mr. Bane told them that at
5 o'clock oh Monday morning, January
4, he called Dr. Beard, who intended to
rise early. He found the doctor in pain
and dispatched a messenger for medi
cine.. Dr. Beard moved painfully from
side to side and then, turning upon his
pillow, seemed to collapse. Mr. Bane
hastened to his side and found >that life
was extinct.
A post-mortem examination showed
that death was due to valvular disease
of the heart.
Dr. E. P. Dennett presented the fol
lowing resolution, which was adopted:
EXPRESSION OF GRIEF.
The unexpected and. to our mortal eyes, un
timely passing of our beloved brother. Dr.
James N. Beard, has removed from our circle a
loyal brother *nd a Christian soldier whosÂ« loss
we mourn with a grief to which words furnish
a mort Inadequate expression.
Just at the prim* of his success, in the midst
of magnificent activity and opportunity, he has
been taken from a work for which only he
seemed entirely adequate. We desire to place
on record expression of our esteem and affec
tion.
In the lucid clearness of his thinking and his
splendid mental-grasp, in the breadth of his in
tellectual hospitality and his practical power to
grapple with practical problems. Dr. Beard had
few equals.
The warmth of his heart, though concealed
under an â¢ exterior calmness that made eome
think him COM, was ruch as to bind to him
with fetters of steel all who had learned to
know him. and to make them count his friond-
Khip among the choicest treasures of their
lives.
He was a true, great heart, ever bearing the
burdens of the burdened and ever ready, to the
full extent of his ability, yea, and beyond his
ability, to help all people and all causes worthy
of help.
The nobility of his character showed itself
in a hatred of shams and a candor and integri
ty that was exceptional in its quality and de
gree.
He had an even: handed sense of justice and
a .uniform courtesy to friend and enemy that
never failed even in mont trying times. While
always etrlct with himself, he was lenient in
his judgment of others.
DEVOTED SOUL TO CHURCH.
He devoted his whole soul to Christ and this
church. ,To them he gave the undivided energy
of his active yean and finally his life Itself.
He had Â¦ settled faith and a religious fervor
that never left him though he faced the doubts
and sins of the age with a candid appreciation
of their depth and significance which is all too
uncommon.
Hi? skill as a revivalist, his influence with
the youth who were" under his !nstructlonj his
mental guidance of the younger ministry, his
record of pastoral and educational work, his
sagacity in the administration of church busi
ness and his manifest influential relations to
the work of the' church at large, and his coun
cil and advice ln all times have -left behind
htm a record of usefuliu'f s which will long re
main a monument to his memory in California
Methodism. - ... -.
We canr.rt forget and. we would not conceal
cur dismay and rrief. We remember with
prayerful sympathy his bereaved and smitten
family. But we thank God for the royal record
of his stainless soul. We rejoice in the legacy
his example and achievements have bequeathed
to the church.
SYMPATHY VOU FAMILY.
From his faithfulness even unto death we
take fresh hope for the church and an inspira
tion for fresh devotion to its purity and pros
perity.
To our sitter, Mrs. Beard, and hor daughters
we extend most fcincerely and deeply our heart
felt sympathy and prayers.
It was also resolved to transmit a
resolution of gratitude to the St. Louis
Methodist ministry and laymen for
their thoughtful kindness and services
following the death of Dr. Beard in
their city.
Among those who were present at the
meeting were:
Dr. H. V. Hcaccck. in the chair; Dr. F. D
Bovard. Dr. K. R. Dille. Dr. G. W. White,

CLERGYMAN'S. PLAIN .VIEWS.
At the Congregational ministers'
weekly meeting held in their headquar
ters in the Y. M. C. A. building yes
terday morning the Rev. J. H. Phillips
read a paper the subject of which was,
"Final State of the Unsaved."
The Rev. Mr. Phillips said he did not
believe in the everlasting torment of
the wicked, but he believed that the
wicked would be finally destroyed ac
cording to the teachings of the Scrip
ture. His reasons were â first, because
the doctrine of everlasting punishment
is utterly inconsistent with reason and
our best judgment: second, because /it
appears to be equally inconsistent with
the character of God. revealed in both
nature and' the sacred Scripture; third,
because the doctrine is not taught in
the Bible in anything like a clear, di
rect and prominent manner; fourth, bo
cause it seems that the Old Testament
when critically examined does not even
appear to teach the doctrine; fifth, be
cause those passages in the New Testa
ment which seem to teach it are ca
pable of other and more satisfactory
explanation.
There was a difference of opinion
shown by the body of ministers and
a strong criticism, it is predicted, may
be looked for. ,
The Presbyterian Union met yester
day morning at the Woman's Occiden
tal Board. Sacramento street, the Rev.
Moses Bercovitz, the president, in the
chair.
The Rev. C. R. Callender. a well
known missionary, read a paper on the
"Laos Mission Sociologically Consid
ered," in which he described-the.ami
able and peaceful lives of the Laos who
are under the Jurisdiction of r the Siam
ese, the British and the French. He
showed that their mode of life con
duced to old age and" that they, take
pleasure in family life a[nd' they con
sider a large family a blessing. Th^
Rev. Mr. Callender quoted statistics
from the - San Francisco' Call which
showed the fatalities in the United
States and compared these 'with the

TOMALES. Jan. 11.â Joseph Sander
sal. James , Zurmlni and Checo and
Crockett Wescott went out In a boat
three days ago to Inspect a French
bark which was wrecked November 21
of last year. On the return trip they
tried to cross the bar on an outgoing
tide 1 , not realizing the impossibility and
danger of such an undertaking. The
breakers were so heavy that their boat
was swamped. Old sailors on the bay
say it was suicidal to attempt to cross
under the existing conditions.
Sandersal landed on Tomales Point
by aid of an oar. The others were car
ried out by the tide. Sandersal arrived
at his home Saturday in a dazed condi
tion and is unable to give an intelligent
account of the disaster. Searching par
ties have patrolled the beach for the
bodies of the two missing men. oPart
of the boat was found, but the bodies
probably have been lost.

Health Commissioner Believes Increase
of Deaths Is Dae to Expectora
tion in Public Places.
NEW YORK, Jan. 11.â Deaths from
pneumonia in this city last week ag
gregated 364 and axe causing the
Board of Health to adopt energetic
'measures to check the progress of the
disease.
"In my opinion," said Commissioner
Darlington of that department to-day,
"the habit of expectorating in public
places has much to do with bringing
on disease. Last week's increase of
deaths from that disease, nearly 100
more than for the corresponding week
last year, is positively alarming, and
I have taken measures' to try to keep
the disease from spreading."
PNEUMONIA CAUSES
ALARM IX NEW YORK
The cadets are the sailors. They do all
the work required' of any crew, and In addi
tion attend the ministrations of a professor
of mathematics, instructors in navigation and
seamanship, and everything else likely to ibe
uyeful to a modern officer of the merchant
marine. The Herz^gin Cecilie also carries
two boatswains, two carpenters, a sailmaker,
four cooks, three stewards, a baker and a
donkey engine operator. Discipline* on board
the training chip is maintained with military
strictness. The- cadet quarters are spctless
and odorless, as is the broad white deck, and
wherever there is brasswork tt is shining like
burnished cold. As an attraction the Herzo
gin Cecllle promises to draw many visitors, who
will be welcomed on board. The cadets are
all boya of good family, some of. them bear
noble names, and the local German colony
has already made preparation to entertain
thern. The Herzocln Cecilie, during her stay
at Portland, where she visited a year ago,
entertained more than 10,000 visitors. She
will dock in a few days to' discharge the 3500
tons of cargo she brought from England.
The Cecille's good time was made in spite
of adverse weather, which beset the wind
jammer's rath almost Incessantly. Terrific
storms were encountered off the River Platte,
and Cape Horn was rounded in the teeth of a
mad procession of howling winter gales. Sail
ing from 50 In the Atlantic to 60 in the Pa
cific, the Herzogln Cecilie, in spite of
the opposition of the element*, occupied only
6 days 6 hours. Some days the training ship
reeled off as many as 320 knots, and during one
period of 37 hours her headway was so slight
that it could not be recorded.
The North American German Lloyd Steam
ship Company's training ship Herzogin Cecllle
arrlxed yesterday, 115 days from Newcastle,
in many months, but Captain Max Dietrich Is
unconao'able because tho passage occupied
more than 100 days. The Cecllle is the hand
somest tailing vessel ever in this port, and
her crew, composed entirely of cadets, one of
the smartest afloat. The Herzogtn is the nur
sery of the North German Lloyd officers. Ca
detp. who are carefully selected, are admitted
to the training service only after attaining a
certain degree of scholarship In the high
echools of the Fatherland. They serve three
years on the Cecllle, one year on a North Ger
man liner and one year in the German navy
before being accepted as officers In the steam
ship service. After that promotion depends
upon their own efforts. Th* Herzogln Cecilie
haÂ« on board fifty-seven cadets. Emll Schln
dler, a cadet, was washed overboard from the
jlbboom and drowned during a gale encoun
tered off the River Platte.

The skipper rolled out and inquired
the cause of the commotion. "Breakers
ahead." shouted a subordinate. Cap
tain Daniel peered forward and saw a
light. He mistook it for a beacon on
shore, but it turned out to be a steam
er, lying hove to. AH about the Aber
deen the waters swirled and foamed,
and in the darkness had every appear
ance of being breakers. The mate had
Been the foamy water and thought the
lookout called 'â¢Breakers ab,ead," when,
in fact, he had passed the word that
there was a light ahead.
The 6teamer was brought about in
time to avoid a collision, but only to
r*cei%'e a huge sea over her stern which
completely enveolped her house and
threatened to drive her bow first to the
bottom. Captain Daniel says the storm
was the worst he has seen off the Ore
gon coast for years.
The identity of the steamship could
not be made out in the darkness, but
her master evidently was afraid to
brave the storm and preferred to re
main hove to until it abated.
PORTLAND. Or., Jan. 11.â But for
the sharp eyes of a lookout on the
steam schooner Aberdeen another trag
edy of the sea would have been enact
ed as that vessel was passing Heceta
Head on her way up the cÂ«ast. She
left Coos Bay Friday morning and went
outside in time to get the full benefit of
the blow which raged that night. Cap
tain Daniel had retired but a short time
when he was awakened by a commo
tion overhead. Amid the roar of the
gale he could distinctly hear the hur
ried command of the mate to the man
at the wheel to "put her hard a-star
board."

Professor Hussey of the Lick Univer
sity was another passenger. Mrs. and
Miss Little, the wife and daughter of
the Sonoma's chief engineer, returned
on the liner. Miss Little is a vocalist of
great promise and local fame. She
gave a number of concerts in the An
tipodes and from the musical critics of
the principal colonial journals received
praise calculated to turn the head of
any less well balanced young woman..
The Sonoma's passengers included
the following named:
"If my trip proves as successful as my
voyage across the Pacific was delight
ful, I will return to Sydney a well-sat
isfied man," is the way Australia's en
tertainment king summed up the nice
things he had to say about the Sonoma
and the attention he and the other pas
sengers had received from Captain
Herriman and his officers.
W. A. Mifrison of the Donohoe-Kelly
Bank of this city returned on the So
noma, a convalescent, but still far from
a well man. Murison left here to take
a trip around the world. In India he
was taken sick and was ordered to the
hills, where his health went completely
to pieces. His only hope, he was told,
was to set back to California. He
boarded the Sonoma at Sydney, appar
ently a dying man, but the sea air and
the administrations of Surgeon McNul
ty worked wonders and, although very
weak, Murison is thought to be on the
road to recovery. . . \
C. A. Green. World's Fair "Commis
sioner to the colonies, returned on the
liner. Green went to the Antipodes
from South Africa, which country he
also visited in the interests of the St.
Louis Exposition. He says the kindli
est feeling for the United States pre
vails throughout the colonies and
comes home with assurances that
Oceanica will be well represented at the
fair. â¢ . *
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
finer Sonoma,- Captain Herriman, ar
rived yesterday afternoon from the
Antipodes and cleared quarantine Just
in time for her British mails to be
placed en board the overland train. The
big liner was somewhat delayed by
head winds encountered between Hon
olulu and this port. The Sonoma did
not call at Fanning Island on the
homeward run. Foggy weather pre
vailed when the liner was in that vi
cinity and as Fanning is a hard place
to find, even in clear weather, Captain
Herriman was afraid that if he stopped
to look for it the time lost might mean
delay for the mail, so he cut out the
Fanning Island call.
Among the Sonoma's passengers were
some notable people. G. Musgrove, one
of Australia's principal theatrical men,
came on the liner from Sydney. He is
accompanied by his wife, who is an
actress, known in stageland as Nellie
Stewart. Musgrove is here and is go
ing to London in search of attractions
for the entertainment of his colonial
patrons. He pays a tribute to the
comfort of traveling on the Sonoma
and expresses the highest regard for
her behavior in all kinds of weather.

>ears.NEW YORK. Jan. 11.â There war a general
agreement to-day that the outlook for a peace
ful adjustment of the Russo-Japanese diypute
was distinctly more cheerful. All the tpecu
la.Uve markets moved In conformity with this
view, stocks and cotton advancing and wheat
thowinp a declining tendency. The movement
in stocks Â»Rf moderate and rather spotty, and
there was obvious difficulty In holdlnj the
higher level or pricey. There was no change
in the character of the war outlook, so far as
published news Indicated, to account for the
reactionary tendency, which prompted the
r-oncluFion that buyers of IVccrr.ber were still
disposed to realize rather than to hold on any
t-trenrtheninj? appearance. The very general
character of the upward movement in low
prade stocks after the opening thin morning
t VM taken as an unpropltious development, ow.
ing to thf- BUFDicion of manipulative. method*

at the existence of. ptock market resources
The revival of their activity is considered
Mg-hly sisnitJcant of the greater liberality of
borrower*, not only in the amount of funds of

there was \'ery little Inquiry from outside
points. Offerings were large, both In the open

all grades of Navel Oranges were quoted lower.
The toj> quotation for Navels' was an extreme
figure for desirable sizes of special brands. At

CHICAGO, Jan." ll.Â«â The whÂ»at market to
day was o. nervous affair, owing to -the uncei#
tainty surrounding the transactions of the lead-
Ing bull intcreFt. Opening prices were steady <
on the comparatively firm attitude of. the, early
Liverpool market, ' r.nd May was unchanged to
V 4 c higher at S6ig$CVic. The market eased oft
soon after opening on\ celling due to larger
world's shipments than expected and on liberal ;
rwÂ«ipts, together with more peaceful news i
from the Far Kast. At S5%c there was con- I
eiderable buying by the big long. The Ucal ;
crowd followed the leading and the market be
came firmer. May advancing to &(J^c, when tlie |
big operator then changed his tactics and *old
freely, and with only ecant support Mey reacted
to 83 %C. The decline wns emphasized by the
latÂ» "Liverpool cables, which were quite weak.
I"o\vsir<! ihi^ clo&e thf> market ag^in rtrTnf 1 '] up
on advices frcm Argentina reporting unfavorr

her In an impoverished condition, al
though she still retains an interest in
a ranch near Napa and claims a share
in a valable lot of diamonds now held
by a local bank and over which she
has been flgtlng in the courts for some
time. A fe,w days ago, when she began
failing, she sent for Attorney, More

other arrangements for the disposal of
her remains. It was agreed that she
should be burled in the family plat of
the Sherwoods in Napa and there her
remains will be taken to-morrow morn
ing by Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood.
The illness that- resulted in Mrs.
Pleasant' s death yesterday dated back
several months. â¢ Last November ) Mrs.
Sherwood called at the home of the col
ored woman at 2107% "Webster street
and found her ill and, wanting neces
sary attention. Although only slightly
acquainted with ."Mammy" Pleasant,
Mrs. Sherwood prevailed on the sick
woman to move to her own â¢ ; home,
which "Mammy" entered on Novem
ber 19. For a time the patient showed
some signs of improvement and : - was
able to move about, but her doctor,
Peter A. Kearney, gave little hope for
her recovery, and, taking . his advice,
the woman, who only a few years ago
was so noted for her mental, and phys
ical vigor, reluctantly prepared for the
end.
Mrs. Pleasant Is not survived by any
blood relations, her nearest relative be

home shortly after "Mammy's" death

Last night the. police found a knife
in j Boeder's room, with which, they
claim,' the crime was committed.
When [confronted; with* the evidence
against him Soeder remained firm in
his .denials. He . was placed In the
tanks and the investigation will go on
to-day. -
Tne landlady said she heard the pal
leave the house at 5 o'clock, the time
they went to. dinner, but did not hear
them return an hour later, when Soeder
says they did. "Â¦'.â.
'.The, body had lain all night in the
roadway.' It, was stiff arid cold, and
the clothing was drenched with moist
ure.
. There is another point on which
the police lay stress. The amount of
money possessed by Blaise was but
$200, according to .the .statement
made by, the man now under ar
rest. A $10,000 'policy, had it been
given, would have cost nearly double
that amount. ..and Soeder would have
had .to. furnish" the funds. \. His readi
ness to- put up a large amount . of
money for a relative with whom he
had just become acquainted, the po
lice say, furnishes a motive for the
crime. '
Newspaper men informed Secretary
S. M. Marks of the Pacific- Mutual Com
pany of the murder and questioned him
regarding the insurance, jj Marks was
surprised and immediately told of the
incidents that led up to the granting
of the policy. Â¦
This information was communicated
to the police and at once detectives
were dispatched to' again find Soeder.
In the meantime Captain Martin ascer
tained the facts surrounding the is
suance of the other policies as stated
above.- ~..;
cause, he thought he had gone to visit
a- family out on the Mission road and
had remained there for the night. Early
yesterday- he asked the landlady If his
friend had come home, and upon being
informed that he had not says he im
mediately started out to the address
on the Mission' road to see what had
become of him. When he went back to
the Jackson street house later in the
day the detectives had already been
there, and he was instructed to go to
the Central police station. Soeder's
story seemed frank enough, and when
he viewed the body at the murdered
man at the Morgue he evinced emotion.
There seemed to be no reason for de
taining him and he was permitted to
go on his way.
INSURANCE PEOPLE TALK.
Soeder told the detectives how he had
brought Blaise to this country and of
their efforts to secure employment. He
said both had gone to dinner from their
room about 5 o'clock Sunday afternoon
and after a repast at a~ Mexican res
taurant on Broadway had .returned
soon after 6 o'clock. Then, Soeder says.
Blaise announced his intention of tak
ing-a,- walk. He ,went from the place
alone^ and Soeder claims he never saw
him alive afterward.
When questioned^ as to- the amount
of money. Blaise had in his possession
the â relative ; stated . that when he ar
rived In this city he had $200,- arid 'that
when he : left the house Sunday night
he had $90 in . his pockets. , In account
ing for. the disappearance of $110 within
five; weeks, Soeder told of the life in
surance >, policy made in . favor .of the
woman, but he failed to mention tHat
in Â¦which he was named as beneficiary.
: <r Soeder then said that he was not un
easy when Blaise did not return, be-
SOEDER TELLS STORY.
: It /was shortly after 8 o'clock yester
day^ morning â¢ When the body of a man
was â¢ found on Taylor street between
Green \ and Vallejo. ; At this point the
ground is high, and adjacent to it is a
bluff of masonry that extends jfome for
ty feet into the air. .The] body lay on
its back, and a gaping wound, from
which- much blood' had ! flowed, was
found in the ,- neck. There I were ' also
cuts on ; the back, of the head,-, dealt by
a sharp^ instrument. At first it was be
lieved that, the victim had been hurled
over the cliff. Later it was found that
the deed had been done where the body
was found and that .the attack of , the
assassin had been quick and sure, j
The! body was found by Wiliarn Ho
gan, who reported his discovery to
Sergeant ! H. H. . Christiansen, who re-,
sides- in *the neighborhood. The ser-"
geaht' hurried to the scene and notified
the 'detective department and then" the
morgue officials. ; ;
; Captain Martin, Sergeant Christian-
Ken and Detectives Charles Cody'and
Tom" Gibson started to work at once
and after, a thorough examination of
the 'scene learned the Identity ot- the
murdered man. â¢ A ; letter written by
his wife gave his address and the land
lady, Mrs. J. Nevilas, from whom he
secured -apartments; told of 'the pres
ence* of Soeder. The latter was re

their idleness the small demand for la
borers of their craft. On December 23
Soeder applied to the. Pacific Mutual
Company for a $10,000 policy on Blaise'3
life. Immediately the agents of the
concern became suspicious and report
ed .the matter to headquarters. ' j It ap
peared Btrange' that a cook, without a
positipn, would desire such a large pol
icy, but. owing 'to the honest'appear
ance of the man, a policy for $3000 was
granted him. Soeder did all the talking
while in {he offices of the Insurance
people. When the policy was taken
out $103 was paid for it, and Blaise's
wife was' made his beneficiary.
Qn January 1 of the present year the
two again visited the Pacific Mutual
building and each took out a policy for
$3000. Soeder was made Blaise's bene
ficiary and vice versa.
MAKES '.BRUTAL ATTACK.
brother-in-law of the murdered man,
under arrest for the crime.
Not only is the accused said to have
murdered his relative who now lies in
the Morgue, but he is suspected of hav
ing taken the life of his own wife. She
died mysteriously near Petaluma a few
months ago and he collected Insurance
"on her life. Then a ranch house that
was Soeder's property burned, an.d
again the insurance people were called
upon to pay a claim presented by him.
The crime of yesterday was diabolical
ly planned according to the investiga
tion made by the detective department.
Blaise was brought to this country
by Soeder, and the last named attempt
ed to insure Blaise's life for $5000 in
New York City. Failing in this, he
tried to induce the. Pacific Mutual Com
pany of this city to give him a $10,000
policy, but the insurance people became
suspicious and refused to allow more
than $3000. Later he succeeded in tak
ing out an accident policy for a similar
amount, in. which he was made the
beneficiary. The murdered man could
not speak English, and Soeder transact
ed all of his business for him, Interpret
ing what he said and telling him what
ever he wished. â¢ .
LURES VICTIM HERE.
Blaise was about 30 years of age. He
had been married to Soeder's sister for
$ everal years and was the father of
three children. Blaise and his family
lived quietly at Hub, Alsace Lorraine,
Germany, until some months ago? when
Soeder went back to the little place on
a visit. The last named had lived in
the United States for more than twen
ty years, and into the ears of his
brother-in-law he poured stories of
great possibilities in California, and
the two came here together about five
weeks ago. Blaise was unable to speak
any language except the German, and
being a stranger in the country de
pended upon Soeder for direction and
advice. Both were cooks by occupa
tion, but since their return had not
been able to secure employment.
'On Decemebr 13 both men arrived in
this city and took apartments atv827
Jackson street'.- They appeared^ to be
quiet people and gave as an excuse for
phia and the daughter of a man of con
siderable means named Williams, who
bonded her out to service in Boston
when she was a mere child. The father
provided ample funds for the education
of his daughter, which seemingly were
well applied, for Mrs. Pleasant was
possessed of more intellig nee than the
average colored person ajid certainly
was regarded as exceptionally shrewd,
as was frequently demonstrated in the
greater part of her career In this city.
Coming to San Francisco in the pio
neer days, she gained prominence first
as a cook, later by her work in behalf of
colored slaves and finally as a ruler of
the destinies of several wealthy fam
ilies.
HER STRANGE INFLUENCES.
For years she seemed to exert a won
derful influence over Millionaire Thom
as Bell, in whose family she t was em
ployed, and after his death she con
tinued to act as dictator of the house
hold and maintained her connection
with the family until a few years ago,
when she and Mrs. Theresa Bell en
gaged in litigation over the property
holdings of the husband of the last
named. It Is only recently that the
lawyers in the case bejan their effo:ts
toward a compromise, which has been
slowly progressing for a number of
months.
The greatest prominence attained by
"Mammy" Pleasant was during the
conflict between the late Senator Wil
liam Sharon and Sarah Althea Terry,
in which she espoused the cause of ths
unfortunate woman, who is now an in
mate of the Stockton Insane Asylum,
to which she was committed a few
years. after the death of her husband.
Judge Terry, who was killed by Dave
Ncagle while assaulting the late United
States Supreme Court Justice Field.
By many Mrs. Pleasant was regarded
as a dangerous woman, but by those
who knew her well she will be remem
bered for her many deeds of charity.
She was possessed of a forceful char
acter that readily asserted itself in all
her dealings, and even when minister
ing to the wants of the needy she
would insist that her will should be
obeyed to the letter.
Some years ago Mrs. Pleasant was
The long and remarkable career of
Mrs. Mary Ellen Pleasant, more famil
iarly known to the San Francisco pub
lic as "Mammy" Pleasant, ended in a
most peaceful manner yesterday fore
noon. Shortly before 11 o'clock, as a
comforting and sympathizing friend
teated by her couch sang the conclud
ing lines of "Rock of Ages, Cleft for
Me," the colored woman, whose name
has been, so frequently linked with that
of many prominent families in this city
during the last thirty years, answered
the summons she had been patiently
awaiting for several days.
She ha/3 realized for a number of
days that the hand of death was upon
her and had made all preparations for
the end. Ker last request was that her
friend, Mrs. L. M. Sherwood of 2751 Fil
bert street, in whose house she died,
chould. when she found that death was
near, cheer her with a religious song.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Sherwood on
entering the room of "Mammy" saw
that her aged charge was rapidly sink
ing. Placing her mouth close to the
patient's ear, Mrs. Sherwood remarked:
" 'Mammy,' I am afraid that you are
dying. If you can hear me give me
evidence of the fact by opening your
Â«yes, for I want to sing to you as I
promised."
DEATH COMES PEACEFULLY.
For a time the wrinkled and sunken
features of the colored woman retained
iheir impassive expression, but finally
yielded to the last effort of the dying
woman, who slowly opened her eyes
and gazed silently into those of Mrs.
Sherwood. A second later the clear
voice of the attendant softly rendered
the words of the consoling song, and
then death ended the dramatic scene.
Mrs. Pleasant died in her ninetieth
ye&r. She was a native of Philadel-
On another sign Johnson declares he
will not discriminate in favor of nor
against any union, neither will he com
pel his employes to join any. A com
parison of conditions shows that he pays
better than union wages by an average
of 15 per cent: also gives better than
union hours, six days constituting a
week's work, and claims that this all
proves the statements of boycotters on
sidewalk to be malicious falsehoods.

their disapproval of the boycott as un-

JOHNSON'S LATEST STATEMENT.
AGED COLORED WOMAN WHO
DIED YESTERDAY AFTER A
REMARKABLE CAREER.
The favor the game of lacrosse has
met with throughout the. coast is ex
ceedingly gratifying to the promoters.
Among the teams that have applied for
admission to the association are five
in this city, several in Los Angeles and
Santa Barbara, one in Portland, one in
Seattle and teams in New Westminster
and Vancouver, B. C.
At a meeting last night at the Olym
pic Club the 'old association was dis
solved and W. J. Black\vell was elected
temporary chairman and A. S. The
berge temporary secretary of the new
association. M. J. Tansey, J. D. Rob
inson and R. l'Hommedieu were ap
pointed a committee to form a new
constitution and by-laws. There will
be another meeting two weeks from
last night at which the permanent of
ficers of the new association will Ote
elected and a name will be given the
club.
The California association started a
short time ago with a membership of
a few teams. Of late so many teams
in coast cities from Los Angeles to
Vancouver, B. C, .have applied for ad
mission that it was considered advis
able to form a new and larger associa
tion. â¢ â¢ *
The California Lacrosse Association
is no longer In existence." Last night
a special meeting was held by the- mem
bers and the old association was dis
solved that a larger one, to take in
the teams of the entire coast, may be
formed.
Several hundred young men have se
cured employment during the year
through the employment agejiey of th?
association, and the men's Sunday so
cial-religious hour had; "more than
doubled in attendance, .while the BiblS
study department hart also largsly in
creased.
It was further shown that the asso
ciation is doing rapid and strong exten
sion work, and especially will this be
the case throughout the various sec
tions uf the city in the future. A
branch has been established in the Pre
sidio and the work among the troops
has been most encouraging.
Addresses were made during the even
ing on the following subjects: '"Our
Work For Youn? Men in Foreign
Fields," F. A. Jackson; "Our Work of
Practical Education For Young MÂ»n
and Boys," Le Roy Burns Smith: "Our
Religious Efforts," George B. McDou
gall; "Our Gymnasium and Physical
Department," Howard Jf.. Strickler;
"â¢The Boys' Side of Our Work," Wil
liam Webb; "What We Undertake So
cially." R. S. Fulford; "Our Member
ship," F. E. Miller.
Following these addresses there was
a genera! discussion. It was suggested
that the special need of the association
was a separate building for boys,
equipped foÂ» industrial education.
Nearly 600 students are enrolled in the
night and day schools for young men
and working boys, and jsp crowded is
the , boys' department that a waiting
list has been established. . â¢
Both day and night 'schools, it was
shown, were taxed almost to their limit
and It was stated that an extra in
structor and another room would soon
be necessary to.carry on the educa
tional work.

The reports of the' various secretaries
and committees showed that the â¢work
of the association had reached a high
state of efficiency and the membership
had reached nearly 2O)0. ' Â¦*
An enthusiastic meeting convened at
the Y. M. C A. last night, when the
annual reports were read and the elec
tion of directors was held. Rolla V.
Watt presided. '-\-X.
It was stated In the report3 that the
greatest yearj In the history of the as
sociation had been in 1903. which, was
the jubilee year. It was shown that
during the year the mortgage of $115.-
OtfO had been paid and the building
dedicated by President Roosevelt on
May 12 last. It had been . therefore, a
year of exceptional happiness for
those in whose hands the management
and direction rested.
A nominating commutes, of which
William D. Kelly was chairman, made
its report and the following directors
were re-elected by acclamation for a
term of three years:
