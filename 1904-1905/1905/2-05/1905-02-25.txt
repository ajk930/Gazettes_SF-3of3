TROUBLE IS NOW BREWING
FOR FRIENDS OF CRESS UNGER
WERE FEDERAL JURORS APPROACHED?
United States Attorneys Are Determined That
Accused Seizure Clerk Be Punished.
The charge of crime against Cress
Unger, ex-seizure clerk at the locai
Custom hou6â¬. has had its many start
ling developments, political and other
but none more surprising than the
ecandal that has followed the aJleged
effort of certain unknown persons to
influent* the United States Grand Jury
In Unger's favor. The story that sev
eral of the Grand Jury had been ap
proached in Unger's behalf was com
mon talk about the Federal building
day, but the United States At
torney, Marshall B. Woodworth. and
Assistant Attorney Charles Ivi. Fickert ;
were not in a position to give any in
formation on the subject.
The report was that a few days ago
certain members of the Grand Jury
were approached by friends of Cress
Unger and George A. Wright and so
licited to ignore the charges of theft
end embezzlement preferred against
the defendants. Unger's -indictment
earning to be certain, it is alleged that
political friends made desperate efforts
ye him and that thegf persons
even went so far as to threaten some
of the Federal prosecutors with po
litical extinction if they did not ease
up on the accused clerks.
Attorney Fickert, who has had
charge of nearly all of the cases of the
character of the Unger and Wright
cases, is said to have cautioned the
Jury against allowing itself to be in
fluenced in any manner whatsoever in
Unger's favor or otherwise. He is said
to have warned the Jurymen to indict
Unger else he would officially inform
United States Judge de Haven of what
he had heard.
FRIENDS MAKE THREATS.
Attorney Woodworth was then ap
proached by friends of Wright, who
boasted of more or less political in
fluence and who said that the political
wires would be pulled in such a way as
to render it difficult for Woodworth to
be reappointed. Woodworth ordered
that Unger and Wright should be in
dicted to the full limit of the charges,
which in Unger's case contain about
seventy counts. The indicement of
Unger is certain and may be made in a
very, few days. The Wright indictment
* may not be filed for a week or more.
There has all along been a mystery
in the power behind Unger. His club
friends are said not to have given him
more than moral support during the
early days of his second trial, but of
late have cut very little figure with
him. However, the mysterious influ
ence that saved the clerk during his
threatened arrest soon after the death
â¢ izure Clerk E. B. Jerome, to
whOM . n he was elevated, was
behind him up to the time of his sec
end offense against honesty a few
months ago.
omplaint was filed against TJnger
for the shortages discovered in his ac
counts soon after he had taken office as
ire clerk. When Unger was pro
moted to Jerome's place Henry Farmer
was given the position of assistant to
Vnger. Farmer found, after a super
ficial examination, that something was
wrong with the books. Upon more
careful inquiry he discovered that cer
tain payments had been held back by
Unger and that there was a shortage
of $1700.
SHORTAGE MADE GOOD.
The powers behind Unger commenced
to work their mysterious influence and
he was permitted to make good the
money he had appropriated. This he

CTTORS AND THE TWO DELIN
QUENT CUSTOM-HOUSE CLERKS.
TNDICTMENTS against Cress Unger,
[ clubman and man about town, and
George A, Wright, accused of em
bezzlement of Government funds while
in the employ of the Customs Service,
will undoubtedly be returned by the
United States brand Jury next week.
As a result of the strenuous efforts of
political friends to assist both men
an ugly story has been circulated that
certain grand jurors have been ap
proached by Unger's friends and an
effort made to influence them. Gov
ernment officials engaged in the prose
cution are net as yet in a position to
give out the facts, but it is conceded
that a scandal is brewing.
ecutlon was at a standstill, the com
pounding of a felony went unchal
lenged and he was reinstated.
Unger wrote a long explanation to
â¢Washington in which he said that the
shortages were not the result of his in
discretion but were handed down to
him by another person whose sins
Unger felt called upon to cover up and
forgive.
The second charge of embezzlement
found against Unger was when Secret
Service Agents Channlng and West re
ported to Collector of Port Stratton
lhat the clerk was $1500 behind in his
accounts. Stratton notified Washing
ton and United States Attorney Wood
worth. Political influence seemed again
to be with the clerk. He offered to re
sign and his friends gave him strong
support in bringing pressure tq bear at
Washington to allow him to retire aft
er making good the losses the Govern
ment sustained through his actions.
Collector Stratton and Attorney Wood
worth stood by their guns and prosecu
tion of Unger followed.
All manner of rumors were extant in
the Federal building during the weeks
following the prosecution of the clerk.
Many of them were wild exaggerations
of the persistency of Unger's friends in
attempting to clear him and there was
also talk of "corporation influence"
that could not be ignored being
brought to bear on the Treasury De
partment.
STRAINED RELATIONS.
There appeared to be strained rela
tions between some of the Federal offi
cials at San Francisco. The report was
that John C. Lynch, Collector of Inter

nal Revenue, was a close friend of both
Wright and Unger and was doing all
within legal right to clear both men.
Lynch is related by marriage to
Wright, and his efforts to help Wright
are said to have angered those engaged
in the prosecution. Lynch retaliated.
No one of the officials who has
knowledge of the correctness or incor
rectness of the reported attempt to In
fluence the jury is in a position to talk.
It is a foregone conclusion, however,
that the prosecution has been much an
noyed by the reports and has told the
jury to" use the utmost care to avoid
discussing the cases. The jurors were
told that an indictment was insisted
upon by the orosecution, else Judge de
Haven would be asked to solve the
mystery of the Unger army of political
supporters.
George A. Wright, whose name has
been brought up in connection with the
alleged Grand Jury scandal, was for
merly Chief Deputy Internal Revenue
Collector under Lynch. He was ar
rested on November S on a warrant
containing four counts charging him
with embezzlement of sums of money
paid to the Government by local firms
for special revenue taxes.

Federal Grand Jury who have the Un

NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â A woman
on a First-avenue horsecar whispered
to the conductor and he to the driver
and the car jumped along by hops and
bounds. At Twenty-sixth street Po
liceman Gallagher rushed into Belle
vuc Hospital for a doctor. By this
lime the woman was quite ill. The
window shutter was raised and the
doctor entered the car. Five minutes
later he emerged, his face wreathed
in smiles.
"It's an eight-pounder and a girl "
h e whispered to the conductor and the
policeman, who were holding back a
score or more of curious ones The
woman refused to go to a hospital and
she and the baby were bundled into
an ambulance and taken home while
a cheer went up from the crowd
"Name her Bellevue," suggested
some one.
The idea caught on and some one
proposed three more cheers for the
baby, which were given with a will
as the ambulance drove off.

DENVER. Feb. 24.â "Gentlemen of
the Jury, I desire to state that I hid
out last night all night away from my
husband, relatives and friends to bring
a complaint against myself to have
these proceedings in lunacy brought in
this court this afternoon, so that it
would be officially settled whether or
not I am insane, or so distracted that I
cannot look after myself."
Such was the startling statement
made to a jury in Judge Henry V.
Johnson's division of the County Court
to-day by Mrs. Jesse M. Martin, for
nine years principal of the Grand-ave
nue School.
Mrs. Martin was a daughter of the
late William R. Scott. She has figured
in the newspapers before, because of
alleged peculiar actions. Drs. H. T.
Pershing and S. D. Hopkins, alienists,
testified that the woman was not ra
tional at times, because of the position
occupied by certain muscles of the hips,
which press against the spinal column,
but added that the indications did not
point to her condition becoming such
that she would do injury to herself or
to others. The jury declared Mrs. Mar
tin sane.
The woman comes of & highly cul
tured family and her relatives, dread
ing publicity, have upon two occasions
heretofore atteniyted to have h*r con-
fined in private institutions where ner
vous diseases are treated. She was in
the county institution in December and
remained ten days.
Jesse M. Martin, the husband, for
merly was Probation Officer of Teller
County, but three months ago, because
of the labor diffic Mlties, lost his posi
tion. Since that time he has devoted
almost his entire time to caring for
Mrs. Martin. However, he is financially
unable to continue this, but, as brought
out during the proceedings, he dare not
leave her because during his absence
Mrs. Martin does odd things, to the
mortification of himself and family.
Mrs. Martin is in many ways a re
markable woman and her face is re
fined and intellectual.

MAY BE A SKELETON
OF PREHISTORIC MAN
Santa Fe Official Makes an Interesting
Discovery in Southern Part
of State.
SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. 24. â W.
H. Oliver, assistant engineer of the
maintenance of way department of the
Santa Fe, has found between here and
Redlands In a gully near the railroad
track a skeleton which is supposed to
be that of a prehistoric man. The
skeleton was laid bare by the recent
rains. It was evidently not buried,
for It was lying on its face with the
knees turned up. There is nothing to
indicate it to be that of an Indian.
The skeleton is still partly imbedded
thirten feet below the surface of the
fields, in a clay formation, which is
held to be prehistoric. There are no
hills or canyons near to explain its
burial by a landslide.

- . i Situation. .
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 24.â The executive
officers of the Western railroads will
meet here next Wednesday to discuss
the coming prosecution by the Govern
ment of the beef trust for violating
the anti-trust law. It is no secret that
the railway managers Â£ear they will be
involved in the suit through their con
tracts to use private cars owned by the
beef trust, if not in other ways more
damaging. It is alleged that Govern
ment officials have evidence to prove
that the railroads entered into a con
spiracy with the beef trust to shut out
competition.
Last month the Interstate Commerce
Commission, after an exhaustive inves
tigation, made a ruling that the Great
Western, the St. Paul, the Northwest
ern, the Rock Island and the Monon
roads were discriminating unjustly in
making rates on livestock higher than
on packing house products, following a
contract made between the Great
Western and the big packers for cer
tain rates on their products for a period
of seven years from August, 1902.
After that decision of the commission
was rendered the executive officers of
the railroad met and agreed not to
abide by it. but to fight it in the courts.
Now it is apparent that some of the
railway managers have changed their
minds and want to reduce the rates xm
livestock in carloads to at least as low
a basis as carload rates on packing
house products.
This question will be discussed at the
Wednesday meeting of the executive
officers, and from present indications
they will agree not to-* fight in the
courts the Interstate Commerce Com
mission's ruling that livestock should
be reduced.

CHICAGO, Feb. 24.â Dr. William R.
Harper, president of the University cf
Chicago, spent a restful night and was
comfortable to-day. The indications
are that there will be no complications
as the result of the surgical operation.
The surgeons expect their patient to
be able to leave his room and attend
to a portion of his duties within a
month. It is reported that they do not
have any substantial hope that the X
ray will have a favorable effect on the
cancerous growth, except to mitigate
the pain somewhat.
Dr. Harper is said to have decided
that in his case the X-ray treatment
should have the most complete trial
possible. Dr. Harper is possessed of a
remarkable power of concentration,
and it is his plan to demonstrate at
least a partial mastery of the mind
over bodily ills by directing his great

NEW TORK, Feb. 24.â A feeling akin
to panic was created among the stu
dents of the New York Polycllnic Med
ical School and Hospital to-day when
it was discovered that, through a mis
take, the wrong patient had been
brought into the amphitheater and sub
jected to a dangerous operation intend
ed for another patient under the same
roof.
The patient intended to have been
operated upon was a woman suffering
from some intestinal trouble, the hospi
tal's officials allege. An attendant had
been ordered to remove the patient
from the ward and to bring her into
the amphitheater, under the Influence
of anesthetics, ready for the operation.
A woman was brought in upon a
wheeled stretcher, under the influence
of chloroform, with a card designat
ing the ward and cot from which she
had been removed.
Without a moment's hesitation Dr.
GofTe made an incision in the abdo
men, at the same time explaining to
the students the conditions which he
expected the operation would reveal.
When the internal organs had been
exposed Dr. Goffe hesitated.
"I do not seem to find here,'* he
said, with a puzzled air, "evidences of
the disease which my diagnosis had
led me to expect."
There was a whispered consulta

sulted in the discovery that a mistake
had been made. The woman is out
of danger and no harm resulted from
the operation, the doctor says.

obtain her release was to supply bonds

out and tried to get bonds, but the

GOVERNOR PUTS
SIGNATURE TO
TWO MORE BILLS
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 24-
Approval has been given by
the Governor to Senator San
ford's bill prohibiting the sale
of intoxicating liquor within a
mile of the Mendocino State
Hospital for the Insane. Sen
ator Carter's bill providing
that real estate may be dealt
in by life i surance com
panies has also received the
Governor's signature.
tiAMK LAW PASSED.
Usual Debate Takes Place in Regard
to the Measure.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 24.â Though
nearly ail members of the Assembly
who had any amendments to the ex
j isting game law gathered and agreed
I on a committee substitute for the vari
ous bills introduced the general mea
i sure could not get through without
lone debate. The plan of a composite
i bill, representing as nearly as possible
I all sections, orevented, however, any
i such continued wrangling as previous
1 sessions have witnessed.
Creighton of Redding offered an
i amendment providing that the open
j duck season begin on October 1 instead
jof October 15. He said such an amend
' ment was necessary to give the peo
1 pie in the duck-breeding fields of the
north a chance to kill some of the
1 birds.
â¢It has been practically said to us
by people down this way." he said,
, "that all we want you people up there
to do is to raise the ducks so they may
I come down to the central part of the
â¢ State for us to shoot. If yie season
remains as it is the people of my sec
tion, will violate the law openly, for
no jury can be found there to convict
: them for what is deemed in that lo
! cality an unjust law.
"The youth of that section see their
fathers violate the law and they foi
low the example. Taught by this ex
ample to violate one law of the State
I they will violate others."
Rolley spoke in favor of Creighton's
amendment, saying the law was
I (hanged two years ago for the express
purpose of giving the sportsmen in and
around Sacramento and San Francisco
two weeks extra hunting.
Creighton's amendment was defeated
and the bill was passed. The para
graph providing that no ducks shall
be killed from a sneak boat had been
eliminated. It was argued that this
worked too much in favor of the rich
and leisure class, who could practice
a great deal at the trans and become
expert wing shots, while the average
marksman would have a much less
chance of securing the bag of fifty,
which is retained as the limit.
Bills were passed by the Assembly
to-day as follows:
By Mucnterâ Providing , an extra Superior
Judge tor San Joacuin County;
By Arnerith â Appropriating . $10,000 for an
electric lighting and power plant for Lick Ob
tervatory.â¢â -â 'â¢â¢ * -â¢ . ' â¢ â â¢â¢ ' - * - â

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 24.â After an
interesting debate the constitutional
amendment affecting sessions of the
Legislature, as proposed by the Senate
Committee on Constitutional Amend
ments, was amended this morning and
sent to the printer. As it now stands
it reads:.
The sessions of the Legislature shall com
mence at 12 o'clock m. , on the* first Monday
after the first day of January next succeeding
th" election of "its members, and after the elec
tion held in the year 1880 shall, be- biennial,
unless the Governor shall, in the interim, con
vene the Legislature by proclamation. No bill
shall be Introduced in either house forty days
after the commencement of each session with
out' the consent of three-fourths of the mem.,
bers thereof.. ~ \- '. . -â¢ â â¢
The members of the Legislature shall receive
for their services the cum of $1000 per session,
to be paid at such time during the session as
may be provided by law and mileage to be
fixed by law and paid out of the State treas
ury; such mileage not to exceed 10. cents; per
mile and contingent expenses not to exceed
$"' for each session.
The Legislature may also provide for ad
ditional help, but in no case shall the total
expense for employes or attaches exceed the
sum of 'ssoo per day for either house, nor shall
the pay of any attache be Increased after he
is elected or appointed. .- V V-'-_v f r : ';.â¢â 
During the debate Senator Carter
proposed a further amendment to the
bill limiting the sessions to seventy-five
days, but he withdrew it when it was
pointed out that if sessions were lim
ited a strong minority might make
such combinations that legislation
would be effectively blocked.
Carter's proposed constitutional
amendment providing for the deposit
of Btate, county and municipal funds in
national and State banks was adopted
and sent to the Assembly. Reconsider
ation of Sanford's bill to establish deer
reserve? and Carter's bill providing for
the appointment of interpreters of the
Italian language in cities and counties
of 100,000 inhabitants was denied.
Senator Shortridge's bill regulating
the use of automobiles on the public
roads of the State was passed and sent
to the Assembly.

THK SAY FRAXCJSCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1905.
SENATE PASSES
A BILL TAXING
CORPORATIONS
Imposes an Annual
Fee of Ten,
Dollars.
s*i)'-cial Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 24.â The Sen
ate got rid of a batch of bills this
afternoon and evening. Among those
finally passed were the following:
By Lukensâ Providing for the increase of the
salary of. the secretary of the Bank Commis
sion and vpsting him with authority to ex
amine banks and file reports of their finan
cial condition, final action thereon to be taken
by the Bank Commission.
By Assemblyman Stanton â Appropriating
$4;fÂ»l 20 for the transportation of officers and
members of the National Guard of California
when on duty for the State.
By Mattos â Making it a misdemeanor to
kill me.tduwlarku and other sons birds except
by ownem Of lands upon which the birds
are destroying crops.
By Cromwell â Making it a misdemeanor to
violate or refuse to conform to the rules and
regulations of the State Board ol" Health
-.expecting the quarantine of persons and ani
mals afflicted with intectious diseases. ,
By Absii iml>!> man McKenney â An act provid
ing that all prisoners upon first conviction of.
felony shall be sent to the San Quentln prison,
which shall become a reformatory, and all in
eorrigibles to Folsom. The bill also permits
of the .sending of felons of a certain age to
ihe Preston School oi Industry when it is
stiown that such action would not endanger the
discipline of the school.
By Treadwellâ An act to pay the judgment
of J . R. Hanify agrainst the State for dam
ages sustained by the breaking of Fremont
street wharf in San Francisco.
By Treadwell â An act empowering the Board
of Harbor Commlssioneif; to lease certain North
Beach lands at their discretion.
Hahn's bill, providing for the pay
ment of an annual license of $10 by
all corporations doing business in the
State, passed the Senate after a
lengthy debate. Several of the Sen
ators Questioned the right of the State
to levy a. license tax, but decided final
ly to vote for the bill and let the courts
decide the constitutional questions in
volved.
The bill providing for the increase
of the salaries of guards at the State
prisons from $50 to $76 a month also
passed.
INHERITANCE TAX DEBATE.
Lukens' bill providing for the levy
of a tax on Rifts, legacies, inheritances,
bequests, devises, successions and
tranfers went over after it had been
strongly assailed by half a dozen Sen
ators. The question as to the wisdom
of the policy of compelling the wid
ows, orphans and mothers of the dead,
to say nothing of other relatives, to
contribute to the support of the State
by special tax after the property had
already been taxed in accordance with
law, was raised by the opponents of
the bill. Many said point blank that
they would refuse to support such a
measure. The debate waxed so warm
that the bill was allowed to go over
for further consideration. There are
yet three special tax bills on the file
for consideration, one referring to cor
porations, one to insurance companies
and one to the sale of liquors.
Beardslee succeeded in having his
and Senator Muenter's bill, providing
lor a third Superior Judge for San
Joaquin County, already approved by
the Senate, passed. Drew of Fresno
opposed it, stating that Fresno had
more legal work than San Joaquin and
it was not asking for an increase in
the judiciary. The Increase in the San
Joaquin bench will begin two years
from now, if the Governor approves the
bill, as a new Judge will be elected
tnen.
ADJOURNMENT CONSIDERED.
Atkinson moved that the concurrent
resolution providing for the adjourn
ment of the Legislature on March 4,
which is in the hands* of the Ways and
Means Committee, be withdrawn at
once and placed on file that it may be
acted on at any time. The motion was
adopted. Members who have appro
priation bills pending are fearful that
the resolution will be adopted and that
their measures will not receive atten
tion. There are many who will fight
adjournment before March 11, unless
the Assembly gets much further ahead
than it promises to be on March 4.
The bill providing that the statute
of limitations shall run against a claim
only from the time the last payment is
made was passed. Assemblyman Pyle
made a speech in favor of It, saying It
would prevent the merchants of the
State from being beaten out of thou
sands of dollars that they now lose.
The grade-crossing hill came back
from the Senate that the amendment
excluding its operations from cities
and incorporated towns might be con
curred in. and that it might be passed
as amended and sent to the Governor.
Walsh moved immediate action, but
Cromwell and Espey asked for time,
saying that the members should be
given time to study the new amend
ment. Walsh himself finally consented
that the matter should go over for
special consideration on Monday aft
ernoon.

BLINGUM SET
Tales of Heated Disputes
at the Athlumiiey Dinner
Provoke a Prompt Denial
OXLY A MERRY SCENE
So Say Guests and to This
Pirouetting "Little Egypt"
Adds a Shrill Disclaimer
A startling rumor that found its way
into the lobbies and cafes of the Palace
and St. Francis hotels last night has
set clubdom by the ears, and like all
rumors it is still growing and there is
no telling where it will stop. It is
whispered that at a swell dinner given
by certain members of the Burlingame
set in a well-known French restaurant
Wednesday night, at which the guests
of honor were Lord Athlumney and his
friend Mr. Ansil of London, some awful
things occurred. It is said that a cer
tain female dancer, a .professional wig
gler from a well-known Market-street
resort, contributed to the entertain
ment of the foreigners and their hosts
from the top of a table, and that finally
there was a row and the whole outfit
was ejected from the place.
It is even said that the trouble was
over the dancer, that because she de
clined to dance, according to prescribed
notions of certain members of the
diners they started a "Tough house."
But nothing at the sort took place, it
is declared.
That there was. a dinner is admitted
and "Little Egypt" coyly confesses
that she danced, not on the table but
on the ffoor. But as to the row and
a scene on the street all the diners
unite in vociferously denying, and
there they rest their case.
"A row! Nary a word nor a blow
that would provoke ill feeling," is the
emphatic declaration of the gentle
men who applauded "Little Egypt" on
that eventful occasion.
"Little Egypt" tells hbw she was
summoned bytefephone to the French
restaurant and "did her part."
"I don't know all who were there,"
said she last night, "but I remember
there were a lot of them. As I entered
the room everybody was addressing
the other as 'your lordship' and I
imagined that I had suddenly fallen
into the midst of an English club
jinks. Then I danced and their lord
ships paid me for my performance, as
they had agreed to, and I left. lam
certain that there was no Quarrel â
that is, while I was present," and
"Little Egypt's" bosom .swelled with
pride as she again recounted her
meeting with the members of British
aristocracy.
DECISION OF LOWER
COURT IS SISTAIXKD
Judgment in Hayti Bond I Yam I Case
stand-, but Damages Against
State Are Annulled.
PORT AU PRINOE. Feb. 24.â The
Court of Appeals in the case of the ap
peal of the NationÂ«U..^|j^k of Hayti
for a reversal of judgment' in the mat
ter of the fraudulent bonds issue*? in
1902 upholds the deci^on of the lower
court, but annuls thejdamagfa against
the State.
The case grew out of the act of the
Haytian Congress of 1902 authorizing
the consolidation of the national debt
in a bond i^sue <rf about $6,000,000 and
an additional $213,282 to be paid to the
Bank of Hayti for financing the deal.
Before the transaction was completed
the Government of President Nord
came into power. The bank officials
were imprisoned a year ago on charges
of bribery and of conspiring with the
Secretary of the Treasury in fraudu
lently issuing from $200,000 to $850,000
in bonds. Of the thirty-three persons
accused, among whom was ex-Presi
dent Sam. thirteen were present at the
trial, the others having fled. The court
rendered judgment in default, con
demning Sam to imprisonment for life
at hard labor.
Madame Sam was sentenced to fif
teen years' imprisonment and several
members of Sam's Ministry and other
high functionaries were condemned to
terms of imprisonment ranging from
five to fifteen years.
AN UNDESERVED ARREST.
Mr. K. I. A. Jake, in attempting to

was arrested two weeks ago, charged
with having in his possession a $10,000
United States Government bond, stolen
twenty years ago in the Manhattan
Bank robbery, to-day was released on
$10,000 bail, pending his examination
before a United States Commissioner.
Dr. Wilcoxson to-day, through his
counsel, again reiterated that he came
by the stolen and forged bond honestly,
having received it from one Samuel W.
Miller, as part payment for stock in a
copper mine which the doctor owned in
Valdez, Alaska. He said he believed
that now he is at liberty he will be able
to find Miller, for whom the police have

YAQUI CHIEFS
PUT TO DEATH
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz., Feb. 24.â Passengers
arriving from Hermosillo report that
as the train left that city a ghastly
sight met the eyes of the passengers.
Six Yaqui chieftains, part of the band
of Indians who took the warpath and
were captured' near Ures, were taken
to an old graveyard, about a mile from
the city, and strung to the trees. The
bodies of the Indians thus executed are
allowed to remain hanging to trees and
telegraph poles for days and sometimes
weeks as an example to others of their
tribe.
Hermosillo is full of troops which will
be sent into the districts where the In
dians are upon the warpath. Several
thousand men have already been
brought into Sonora through the port
of Guaymas and from Chihuahua.
Governor Ysabell has received a let
ter signed by five Seri chiefs, offering
to take the field against the Yaquis
with a force of five hundred archers,
but the Mexican authorities are not in
clined to trust these bloodthirsty in
habitants of Tiburon Island, who
themselves have given the Government
much trouble in the past.
Minor depredations are reported from
every section. A trader, who ventured
to make a trip from La Colorado to a
neighboring town without a guard,
was murdered and his wagons plun
dered. The authorities have made no
concerted movement recently, prefer
ring to await the arrival, of reinforce
ments.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24.â Consul-
General Hanna telegraphed to the
State Department from Monterey to
day that the Mexican Government has

OPPOSES VOTING
BY THE RED MAN
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â Efforts to
harmonize the differences over the
statehood bill continued fruitlessly in
the Senate to-day. There seemed to be
no disposition on the part of the
friends of the proposition for two
States to be made of four Territories
to accept a compromise permitting Ok
lahoma and Indian Territory to come in
at the present session and compelling
the other Territories to wait.
Morgan intimated that the pressure
to secure the passage of the bill was
due to would-be officeholders. Speak
ing of the provision for voting by the
Indians, he said:
The pettifogging- politician could ha%-e no
better fleld than this. With a bottle of whiÂ«ky
a few pipes and some gewgaws, hÂ« can achieve
marvelous results.
He predicted that the scandal that
would come out of these elections
would adhere not only to the new
State, but to the people of the United
States.
Morgan read a magazine article
quoting Governor Garvin of Rhode Isl
and on political corruption in that
State, and said:
That i.x the cultured State of Rhode Island:
If men go openly into the market there to buy
votes, what may be expected from a community
like that of Indian Territory, unrestrained
by safeguards of any kind?
Morgan declared that if Indian Ter
ritory is to be converted into a State
there should be a law making it a pen
itentiary offense to go to the polls with
a jug of whisky. Otherwise, he said,
the Indians all would be drunk before
election and remain so as long as
there was whisky.
Foraker interrupted to move to ad
journ, but before doing so he yielded
to permit a motion to appoint confer
ees on the Panama canal bill. Bailey
objected, saying that no more confer
ences could be had until the statehood
matter was settled.

of the questions that followed.

Chadwick, and the retttw daciarad
that that explanation of her position

The referee's examination was a se

Chadwick answered a few questions,
but her answers were remarkably free
from information. Finally the court
and counsel on all sides agreed that
the examination might Just as well
stop abruptly because there â was no
hope of securing any Information from
the bankrupt. Accordingly March 13
was set for a resumption of the hear

Chadwick would testify freely on that

WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.âRepresen
tative Vandiver of Missouri introduced
he following resolution In the House
to-day:
solved. That thÂ« Attorney General inform '
the House at his earliest convenience whether
or not any proceedings have been instituted,
either civil or criminal, against the armor
plat* trust, and if not. why not? And further
Resolved, That the Attorney General also in
form the House what steps have been taken
by him to determine whether or not said
armor plate trust should be prosecuted for
violation of the United States ami-trust law
of July 2. 1890, or other United States statuies
against trusts and combines on the restraint
of trade .
The resolution was referred to the
Judiciary Committee.
A preamble to the resolution recites
that on September 6, 1901, the Attorney
General was petitioned to institute civil
and criminal proceedings against the
Carnegie Steel Company and the Beth
lehem Steel Company, as combining
and constituting what the petition aJ
leged was an armor plate trust for con
trolling the price of armor plate, and
that there was filed with the Attorney
General and with the President a
statement of facts and evidence show
ing a conspiracy, whereby the trade
and commerce in armor plate had been
monopolized and the armor plate trust
enabled to sell many thousand tons of
armor plate to the United States Gov
ernment at prices ranging from $445 to
$520 a ton, after a duly appointed board
of expert naval constructors had re
ported that the actual cost of the ar
mor did not exceed $187 a ton. The pre
amble further alleges an agreement be
tween the Carnegie and Bethlehem
companies as to prices and that they
have divided the contracts of the Gov
ernment between themselves, each bid
ding lower than the other for one-half
of the armor required at any time by
the Government. Additional evidence
of this conspiracy to prevent free and
open competition in bids for armor
plate, the preamble continued, had been
shown in the hearing of the present
Secretary of the Navy when, on Janu
ary 26. 1905. Secretary Morton stated to
the House Committee on Civil Affairs
that the bids of the Bethlehem and
Carnegie companies on 7^o tons of
armor plate, which had beeri opened on
January 12 last, were discovered to be
identical.

CRUEL HOAX
OF AGITATORS
Russian Peasants Made to
Believe Czar Has Ordered
a Distribution of Lands
3IOOIKS AEE EXCITED
Already Measuring and Stak
ing Off the Ground That
They Expect to Eeceive
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 25.â The be
ginning of a dangerous movement has
been observed among the peasantry of
some of the southern provinces, where
revolutionary agitators are circulating
reports that the Emperor will on
March 4 issue a manifesto providing
for a general division of lands. A new
allotment has been the dream of the
Moujiks ever since emancipation and,
according to private reports, the sto
ries have spread like wildfire and are
implicitly believed.
In the government of Tula a large
proprietor went to his estate last week
and found the peasants at work meas
uring and staking their shares. In re
sponse to his demands for an explana
tion, they told him of the coming man
ifesto. Refusing to listen to his decla
ration that the report was absurd, they
would only say:
"We have heard the little father has
decided."
When the proprietor asked what
would become of him, they replied:
"Oh, we will leave you the building
and forty acres."
Once the peasantry becomes pos
sessed of the idea that the Emperor
has willed a division 1 of land it will be
exceedingly difficult to disabuse their
minds, and agrarian troubles on a
large scale are feared. The Moujika
are likely to turn on the proprietors as
they did several years ago in the prov
inces of Saratoff and Polteva, when
anarchy reigned for some time.
Among the reservists, agitators are
spreading the story that the war is
over.
CZAR ENDS RAILWAY STRIKE.
Grants the Demands of the Workmen
on Polish Roads.
MINSK, Feb. 24.â The manager of
the Libau-Romny Railway says that
Emperor Nicholas has ordered the es
tablishment of a nine-hour day in all
railway stations and workshops and
that the employes should be allowed to
elect representatives to report on their
grievances. An increase of pay is
promised. The statement created
great satisfaction and work on the line
has been resumed.
WARSAW. Feb. 24.â The Governor
of Warsaw has been notified by the
Warsaw and Vienna Railway that the
Railway Council at St\ Petersburg
consented to increase the wages of em
ployes of the road this year by a sum
of $325,000. The men have been noti
fied that their demands have been ac
ceded to and an immediate resumption
of traffic is expected.
FEW ABLE TO READ OR WRITE.
Warsaw Official Says the Russian
Strikers Are Illiterate.
"WARSAW, Feb. 24.â Imperial Coun
cilor Mienkein, who, because of the
illnees of Governor General Tchertkoff
is virtually acting as Governor Gen
eral of Poland, said to-day that, with
the exception of Warsaw, the condi
tion throughout Poland was improving.
In Warsaw the strikers return to work
one day and walk out the next. Speak
ing generally, the councilor said:
The whole strike movement is in the nature
of an epidemic. Starting from St. Petersburg
it has ravaged other parts of the empire. A
strike In Russia is a very different matter
from a similar movement In Great Britain or
Germany. There the workmen are educated,
while In Russia only a few are able to read
or understand what they are demanding. Such
a condition tends greatly to complicate the
situation and renders a settlement much mure
difficult.

TRADE IMPROVES
WITH WEATHER
Dun's Review Eeports Con
fidence in Every Branch of
Industry and Firm Prices
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â R. G. Dun &
Co.'s weekly review of trade to-mor
row will say:
Ettter weather has greatly Improved trade
In many sections of the country, spring mer
chandise being distributed freely by Jobber*,
while retail business and mercantile collec
tions are more normal.
In almost every branch of Industry there 1Â«
confidence of active trade with the appearance
of settled weather. The prices of commodities
are still firm. Railway earnings for the month
of February thus far were 6.2 per cent smaller
than last year, and foreign commerce at this
port for the laet week made another phenom
enal record as to imports, exceeding the game
week last year by $9,347,234, while exports
were $2,321,406 larger.
Failures this week numbered 252 In the
United States, against 240 last year, and 29 in
Canada compared with 22 a year ago.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
With the exception of a few lake and sea
board ports which show the effect of past bad
weather, distributive trade at most leading
markets assumes a more favorable aspect. This
is due to the spread of milder weather condi
tions and the Increase In the number of coun
try buyers.
The general"^ tendency of reports as to the
winter wheat crop is that the heavy snow
covering has helped the crop. Heavy rain o*
the Pacific Coast has made good crop pros
pects, especially In California.
Wool is slow of sale and easier In price
for low grades.
Among the industries Iron and steel still
show relatively the most active demand and
the largest turn over.
Business failures In the United States for
the week ending February 23 number 220,
against 243 last week and 200 in the like
week In 1904.
In Canada failures for the week number 27,
which compares with 17 last week, 15 in the
same week last year and 27 In 1903.
Wheat Including flour, exports for the week
ending February 23. are 923.022 bushels, against
636,540 last week. From July 1 to date the
exports are 42,504,470 bushels, against 106,
846,697 last year.

SALLY SHARP
What a dash the army and navy give
to the social life of San Francisco! And
to a ball! Why, the two arms of the
service are as paprika to cheese. And
so it was last night at the Friday Co
tillon at the Palace â the last of the
dizzy dances of the newborn dancing
club, when tons of gold braid and bul
lion on the manly bosoms of young
warriors gave the affair a fine distinc
tion â and to the total extinction of
mere civilians.
But will not some good Christian lift
a helping hand in behalf of naval offi
cers, that some sort of a sane dress
coat be adopted, instead of the carica
ture that is now worn? It's not so ter
ribly bad tor a big, athletic fellow, but
the dapper little chaps look like the
deuce under those Garibaldi epaulettes.
Those navy men â coats or no coats â
were immensely popular with the girls
last night, however generously sharing
honors 'with the Presidio and Fort Ma
son fellows. And I entertain a strong
suspicion that the lads about town are
not keen on "army and navy" dancesâ
they wouldn't admit defeat, of course;
but they weren't enthusing o'er much
over the innovation.
With the colors aloft and gleaming
bravely from the ivory pillars, the uni
forms made a gay picture, threading in
and out from among the groups of
stunning women. Not without value,
however, were the "plain-clothes" men,
whose black and white furnished a
strong note in the ensemble â and some
rather clever dancers.
Punch was served in the vestibule
and in the Empire Room, and, as usual,
supper in the Maple Room. Here the
tables were graced with masses of
green foliage, with pink, red and green
shaded candelabra. There was the
usual outpouring of debutantes, belles
and youngish matrons for this last
dance, and some mighty fetching
gowns were worn. Among them were:
Mrs. Ynez Shorb White, fn white crepe de
chine over white silk.
Mlee Ethel Shorb, iridescent sea green chif

Miss Dorothy Duetan, spangled and em

MINORITY WINS
FIGHT IN HOUSE
Appropriation for Kental of
the Old New York Customs
Building Is Stricken Out
DENOUNCED AS A STEAL
Sulzer and Williams Claim
Money Would Have Gone
to Standard Oil Company
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â 1n the
House of Representatives to-day the
fight that had been waged for many
years against the appropriation of
$130,600 for rental of the old New York
Custom-house resulted in a victory.
Hemenway of Indiana, chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, being
unable to muster sufficient strength to
retain the provision in the bill. The
opposition was led by Sulzer of New
York, supported by Williams of Missis
sippi, the minority leader, both of
whom denounced the expenditure as a
public scandal and in the interest of
the Standard Oil Company, which. It
was alleged, was behind the National
City Bank, the purchaser of the build
ing from the Government. The action
in striking out the provision was on a
strictly party vote.
Sulzer, in opposing the provision,
said it was the "old, bewhiskered.
long-standing steal of the City Na
tional Bank.
"It is a notorious scandal, a steal and
a fraud." he vigorously asserted, and
he could not understand why the City
National Bank had not been compelled
to pay to the Government the $3,000,
000 purchase money for the building,
instead of the money being simply
transferred on the bank's books, except
that it was due to the influence of the
Standard Oil Company, which owned
the bank.
Explaining that he was not defend
ing the contract which was made by
Gage, who was then Secretary of the
Treasury, Hemenway contended that if
the amount for rent were not appro
priated the bank could go into court
and get a judgment.
Hemenway admitted in reply to Wil
liams that no deed had passed from the
Government to the bank and that the
bank was not paying taxes on the
building. Hemenway insisted that
former Secretary Gage was not
charged with having committed a
crime, but with having made a bad
contract.
"He has not committed a crime!" In
terjected Sulzer. "Why. as soon as we
got an honest President he had to get
out of the Cabinet."
Williams said he did not criticize the
original transaction, but he asserted it
was the subsequent dealings that were
surrounded with fraud, in order to ob
tain Congressional appropriations.
A motion by Sulzer to strike out the
provision prevailedâ 93 to 71.

Secretary of State Asks De
partment of Justice to
Make an Investigation
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24.â The Secre
tary of State has called to the atten- "
tion of the Department of Justice cer
tain members of bodies of men ia
Mobile, Ala., who are said to be en
gaging in a filibustering expedition
against Guatemala. This action wu
taken at the suggestion of the Guate
malan Government, which represented
that an American port was being used
as a base of hostile operations against
a friendly nation and that the men.
who were represented to be merely
laborers going to develop a railroad
concession, were really part of a fore*
recruited in the United States to initi
ate a revolutionary movement in Guat
emala.
The State Department has asked th*
Department of Justice to make an in
quiry and if need be to take the neces
sary steps to thwart the movement.
The relations between Guatemala and
Mexico threaten to become seri
ously strained, the former Government
being disposed to connect the revolu
tionary movement with Mexican activ
ities. Mexican troops placed on thÂ«
boundaries between the two countries,
ostensibly to maintain neutrality and
prevent the organization of filibuster
ing expeditions directed against Guat
emala, are under suspicion of being in
tended to invade the smaller republic,
and a rapid exchange of dipiomatio
notes is in progress between Guate
mala City and the City of Mexico.
Meanwhile, following the precedent es
tablished during the existence of the
last clash between the two Govern
ments over the boundary line several
years ago, the State Department has
instructed its agents in both countries
to use their good offices to prevent the
growth of ill feeling between the two
countries, and is doing all that it can
properly here in the same line.

\DO, Switzerland, Feb. 24.âPierc

was completed at 7:20 o'clock this
ing. The work was commenced in
Ifc9B.
The meeting of the boring parties
Swiss and Italian) waa signaled
throughout Switzerland by ringing of
hurch bells and ssJutes by cannon.
Many unexpected obstacles were en
â¢untered, ihe most serious being hot
springs, vhich threatened to wreck the
whole enterprise, and a temperature
which at one time rose to 131 degrees
Fahrenheit, making a continuance of
the work impossible until the engineers
i.iund means of cooling the atmosphere.
Now that tno borers have met it will
enable thr- water accumulated in the
north gallery to be drawn oft.
The work of preparing the tunnel for
a permanent railway will be rushed as
rapidly as possible and it is hoped to
inaugurate the tunnel about March 20.
The piercing of the Simplon is re
garded as being one of the engineering
â¢ vements of the age. Many diffl
' ulties were encountered and overcome.
The length of the tunnel from Briga, in
jprland, to Izelle, on the Italian
side of the mountain, is about twelve
miles. "Work was begun more than
seven years ago and, according to con
tract, the tunnel must be ready for
traffic on May 15 next. The SwiÃS and
Italian Governments jointly financed
the undertaking, share and share alike,
at the cost of $15,000,000. As 6oon as the
boring is thoroughly completed and the

constructed, parallel to thÂ« large one,
which will be increased in !*ize, so as to

ART IN PHOTOGRAPHY
. Â« â
Dr. Arnold Genthe Shows Marvel
ous Pictures at Vlckery's.
SCENES FROM SPAIN AND MOROCCO
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
Can photography be classified assart?
Now, before you say unholy things,
go out to Vickery, Torrey & Atkins'
and make a fair and honest study of
Dr. Arnold Genthe's photographsâ
those that he brought over with him
from Europe. And if you're honest,
and on speaking terms with the prin
ciples that underlie art, you will have
to admit that some photography; can
be art, and that Dr. Genthe's IS.
True, the medium of these- wonderful
Spanish and Moroccan scenes is â¢me
chanical. The camera in a few seconds
caught the picture in its entiretyâ that
would have taken months to produce
with a brush. But what of the infinite
taste, understanding and instinct that
suggested the bits of landscape or the
types of people in the manner of their
presentation? Could such an aggrega
tion of splendid results ensue from ac
cident? Or was it a keen sense of val
ues, an instinctive knowledge o* com
position that wrought such sensitive
things from the camera's eye?
Nearly all the pictures were gathered
while Dr. Genthe was wandering about
in Spain and in Morocco, and it is evi
dent that the romance and glamor of
the country soon enthralled him, even
as it did Washington Irving, who c- n
fessed to have found himself enthralled
by the atmosphere cf old Granada. It
is this intensity of-sympathy and feel
ing, quite as much as his sense of com
position that lifts Dr. Genthe's work
into the domain of art. And the truth
to tell, these photographs show a in
finitely vaster sympathy and under
standing than some paintings I have
known.
As to the methods of their produc
tion, here is mastery of the mechanics
of photography. Take, for instance,
"The Cathedral of Cordova," outlined
against a cloudy sky, high up from the
banks of a shimmering river. Night
has almost fallen, and the great black
pile of dome? and turrets throws its
spectral shadow In the waters below.
But to impart the sense- of illusion and
of distance. Dr. Genthe has caught the
nearby bankrin the view, black with
the falling shadows.
This picture is, to my humble mind,
one of the .most, subtle and thoroughly
artistic things in the collection. Then,
for delicacy of detail, mechanically, and
for taste of composition, artistically,
"Market Day in Granada" is perhaps
one of the best, just as "The Gypsy
Girl" is one of>Â£he fetchlngest figure
pictures This daredevil of a Romany
child threw a lot of spirit into that
picture, which Dr. Genthe was not
slow to . catch. And herein again lies
the artistic instinct, the quick percep
tion as manifested in the ready eye
and the dextrous hatod.
If, after having seen the collection
(which runs until March 7) you refuse
to admit that photography may be
art â and sometimes la â then is jrour
mind hermetically sealed.

DOES NOT WANT
NEGRO LYNCHED
Mississippi's Governor Is
Making Fight to Prevent
Mob Acting in Jackson
JACKSON, Miss., Feb. 24.â The ex
citement over the assault on Miss
Mamie Marsh by a negro continued to
day, its effect being heightened by the
burning of a negro church. The flames
are believed to have been of an in
cendiary origin. A negro with blood
on his clothing and scratches on his
face has been arrested and the police
believe they have the right man. The
negro has been put in the city Jail,
which is surrounded by the local com
pany of militia, called out by Governor
Vardaman.
When the news of the crime reached
him the Governor sent his friends all
ever the town as emissaries of law and
order, telling them to plead with ev
ery man they met to allow the law
to take its course.
Then he started on a personal cam
paign. Charging up and down the main
street, he expostulated with every
group of men on the corners and used
*very argument at his command to in
duce them to disperse. The Governor
soon saw his efforts were likely to
prove unavailing, and finally went with
the rapidly increasing mob to the
Courthouse, where, according to ru
mors, the young woman's assailant was
under guard.
The reports were unfounded, but the
mob refused to believe the Sheriff and
began making threatening demonstra
tions. Governor Vardaman, after in
structing the Sheriff and his deputies
to defend the prisoner to the last if
he should be brought to them, mount
ed the steps and began an impassioned
address. He declared the law provided
fit and proper punishment for the crime
in question, assured the citizens of
Jackson that there would be no delay
in carrying it into effect and pleaded
with them to "allow the law to take
its course."
Miss Mamie Marsh was going homo
from the State House, when she was
seized by a negro and dragged into the
yard of a residence. She was beaten
into insensibility and may die from her
injuries.

MAKES BIG HIT
WITH HUGO PLAY
Bernhardt Revives in Paris
Angelo, Tyrant of Padua,
Popular Fifty Years Ago
DRAMA A MASTERPIECE
Play Gives "Divine" Sarah
Opportunities for Acting
She Seldom Has Had
PARIS, Feb. 24.â Whenever Sarah
Bernhardt decides on another Ameri
can tour it ia pretty safe to say what
will be one of the first pieces selected
for her repertoire. Bernhardt was in
spired recently to revive Victor Hugo's
half-forgotten drama, "Angelo, Tyrant
of Padua," chiefly by the fact that her
great predecessors. Mars and Rachel,
both made successes in it, and without
much idea that the play would draw to
any extent. But lo and behold! this
work of Hugo's, unacted for more than
fifty years, has hit Paris so hard that
It looks like running for months. In
reality there is nothing surprising
about it, for the play's construction
shows the master's hand, its move
ment is as rapid as though it had been
written yesterday, and it gives Bern
hardt such opportunities for acting as
she seldom has had recently.
The plot is thoroughly Hugoesque.
The time is the middle of the sixteenth
century, when Padua was a tributary
to Venice. Angelo, the Governor of
Padua, though married, is madly in
love with Tisbe, the beautiful leader of
the half-world in his city. But she
keeps him at arm's length, for she is in
love with Rodolfo, a young nobleman.
But Rodolfo, on his side, treats Tisbe â
Bernhardtâ almost as cavalierly as she
treats the Tyrant, for his heart has
been won by a beautiful woman whom
he has seen only once and has not been
able to identify. Suddenly there ar
rives upon the scene a spy named Ho
modfci, sent by the Council of Ten at
Venice to make trouble. He contrives
to get possession of the secrets of the
different personages of the drama and
promptly resolves to play them against
each other. Homodei also discovers
that the mysterious lady with whom
Tisbe's beloved Rodolfo is infatuated
is no other than the wife of Angelo the
Tyrant. Whereupon the spy decoys
Rodolfo into the Tyrant's house by
promising to show him the woman he
loves, and also brings Tisbe there to
prove to her that the man she loves is
unfaithful.
A POWERFUL SCENE.
The scene in the palace is a power
ful one. Caterina, the Tyrant's wife,
and Rodolfo are together when Tisbe
enters, and the man has just time to
hide himself and thus avoid actual dis
covery. But the demi-mondalne sus
pects his presence and she upbraids
her successful rival with bitterness and
is ready to bring down vengeance on
her head. The opportunity is favor
able, too, for suddenly the Tyrant en
ters, attracted by the noise. Tisbe is
on the point of denouncing his wife to
him when she discovers on the wall a
crucifix given by her own mother to a
young woman who had saved her from
the gallows. Bernhardt's glance at this
little cross and her portrayal of the
woman's struggle between jealousy and
compassion are conceded to be among
the finest bits of acting seen in Paris
in recent years. Compassion wins and
Tisbe makes a specious excuse to An
gelo for hia wife's presence there and
thus saves her.
Now, however, Homodei, the Vene
tian spy. Sends the Tyrant a letter
proving to him that his wife loves an
other, but does not reveal Rodolfo's
name. Angelo decides that his wife
must die and gives her the choice of
the axe, or poison. But Tisbe saves
her rival again. She volunteers to help
Angelo make way with his wife and
advises Caterina to accept poison. In
stead she gives her a powerful nar
cotic, undertakes to get rid of the body
and has Caterina taken to her own
home. Rodolfo, learning what has
happened, hastens to Tisbe's palace. It
is she, he believes, who has murdered
his sweetheart and he curses her to
her face. Sure now that she has no
hope of being loved by Rodoflo, Tisbe
has but one desire â to die at his hand..
She cries, "I killed her, I tell you,
strike me!" and Rodolfo plunges his
dagger into her bosom. At this mo
ment Caterina awakens, and as Ro
dolfo asks, "Great God, who saved
you?" Tisbe, with her last breath ex
claims, "By me for thee."
One doubts if this character ever was
played before as Bernhardt plays it.
Her anger and frenzy at Caterina in
the second act and her pathos after the
discovery of the crucifix move many
to tears. Blanche Dufrene is a capable
Caterina and the Homodei of Max is a
subtle piece of acting.
COQUELIN FOR THE SEXATE.
Will "Cyrano" become a French
Senator? Paris is wondering, and
rather chuckling at the thought. In
the minds of Parisians, of course, Ros
tand's hero and his greatest portrayer,
Coquelln, are associated inseparably,
and Coquelin has just been invited to
"stand" for the Senate. The invitation
comes from a country constituency and
the actor actually has accepted it. It
is not unthinkable that he will be
elected. His duties a 9 a Senator would
not necessarily interfere with his
theatrical cereer, for important days
in the Senate are rare and the great
comedian would be considered as doing
his duty if he only attended once a
month.
Sardou ana Mascagni have* met and
formed a friendship and as a result
the composer is going to make an
opera out of one of the dramatist's
works. Mascagni is now in Paris,
where he is being feted in a way that
is making him forget his rather tragic
experience in the United States last
year. The other day, it having come
to his ears that Victorien Sardou wished
to meet him, Mascagni went to the
playwright's house, to be received with
open arms, Sardou declaring that he
was the first to applaud "Cavalleria
Rusticana" in France. After a while
the dramatist said, "Ho-nr would it be

"I shall be only too honored and
happy," was the prompt reply.
"Then," Bald the other, "choose!
With the exception of 'Hatred,' which
I dream of having: acted in Prance Just

They are at your disposal!"

OSLER ADHERES
TO HIS VIEWS
Repeats His Assertion That
Men Past Sixty Years of
Age Should Be Retired
LAUGHS AT HIS CRITICS
Scientist Says That His
Reference to Chloroform
ing Was Only a Pleasantry
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
BALTIMORE. Feb. 24.â Dr. William
Osier, who declared that nothing had
been accomplished for the progress of
the world by men more than forty
years old. and that all men more than
sixty should be retired or chloro
formed, returned from New York to
day, much surprised at the storm of
criticism he had awakened, but adher
ing to his statements.
This has been a conviction with Dr.
Osier for years, and he has for a long
time been engaged upon an essay to be
called "The Crisis of Forty Years," in
which the statements referred to are
the text, the conclusion and the whole
theme.
Dr. Osier admits that men above for
ty years old have a great place to fill
and are needed In the world, but he
declares that the vitalizing, fundamen
tal creation in science, literature, art
and elsewhere are by men under forty.
This is the rule, he insists, which
some exceptions only serve to accent
uate.
As to chloroforming men at sixtyâ a
plan he designated as admirable â Dr.
Osl4r laughed heartily at the severe
criticisms it has brought cut.
"Of course," said the doctor, "that
was only a pleasantry. I was quoting
from Antony Trollope's story, 'The
Fixed Period," and his story hinged
upon chloroforming of an old fellow
at sixty. I am very sorry my essay is
not ready for publication. I think it
will show pretty well that the best
work of a man is done while he is un
der forty years of ag"?.**
NEW YORK. Feb. 24.â J. Pierpont
Morgan, 62 years old, "seemed much in
terested when this question waa sent
in to him to-day:
"Should a man be chloroformed when
he is 60, or is he worth preserving alive
for a while longer?"
After a hearty laugh he dictated this
reply:
"Mr. Morgan says he has about
thirty engagements to meet during the
next hour or two, and he would ask to
be excused from saying anything fur
ther than that he feels as young and
can do as much now as he could be
fore he was 40."
CHICAGO, Feb. 24.â President James
B. Angell of the University of Michi
gan does not subscribe to the state
ment that men lose their usefulness
when they reach the age of 60 years.
Dr. Angell, in an address at the annual
banquet of the Chicago Alumni Asso
ciation of the University of Michigan,
said:
I would like to extend the time of a man's
life Instead of shortening It. The experiment
of klllln* off old men has been tried In
Africa for centuries, and I would suggest to
tbe distinguished physician that civilization
haa not advanced very rapidly there.
LITIGATION BEGUN OVER
PROPOSED ELECTRIC T TNE
City of Palo Alto Object* to Methods
of J. F. Parkinson, the
Projector.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 24.â More trouble
and litigation is ahead for J. F. Par
kinson, the promoter of the Santa
Clara County Interurban Electric Rail
way, which is to run from Palo Alto
to this city. To-day suit was com
menced by the town of Palo Alto, in
the name of the people of the State,
against Parkinson, in which he is
asked to show cause why he has as
sumed privileges and franchises for his
proposed railway which have not been
granted him. An injunction is also
asked to prevent him from construct
ing and operating the proposed road.
The complaint states that Parkinson
claims the right to construct and oper
ate an electric railway upon certain
streets in the town of Palo Alto, but
that he has no such right.
It is the franchise on University
avenue that is being attacked. This
proposed route is from the Southern
Pacific depot across the full length of
the town. A short time ago the South
ern Pacific secured a temporary in
junction to prevent Parkinson from
crossing the track at that point with
his road. Parkinson now has the ma
terial on hand to construct this part of
the road, which is the beginning of a
line to be built to this city.

MARYSVILLE, Feb. 24. â Gordon

day. He is the son of Dr. Hawkins of

Hayes Valley 3lerchants Ob
ject to Block No. 73 as a
Site for Public Library
The Board of Education yesterday
declared itself opposed to the proposi
tion suggested by the Supervisors'
Public Utilities Committee that the
proceeds of the sale of a portion of the
school bonds amounting: to $650,600 be
applied to the Immediate purchase of
lands to be used as sites for the build
ings. The committee believes that the
money should be so expended in view
of the fact that real estate values will
enhance and a saving will be effected
by buying thÂ« land at once.
The members of the Board of Educa
tion take an opposite view, claiming
that the money 6hould be used to erect
the first seven buildings considered as
absolutely necessary to relieve over
flowing attendance in several districts.
The object desired is to provide school
facilities in these districts, which will
not be attained if only the sites for
most of the buildings be purchased.
School Directors Altmann and Walsh
were ready to present their case to the
committee yesterday, but a proposed
wiet-ting for the afternoon had been
postponed earlier in the day until next
Friday afternoon.
Walsh has prepared a list of the
school houses to be built, in order of
their urgency, as follows:
Washington Grammar, building $119.
000. lot $14,300; Spring Valley, build
ing $119,000. lot $24,700; Burnett or- New

The cost of thÂ»-sp seven buildings, in
cluding the sites to be purchased, ag
:e sum of $626,200, and there
will be $650.6<Vi available from the
bonds sold. There are twenty-fi/ur

dent and Harry M. Kelly is secretary,
against the selection of Western Addi

STREET MENDICANT EMPLOYS
A BUSINESS MANAGER
THEY' DO TEAM WORK
ONE PRETENDS TO HAVE BURNT
HAND AND THE OTHER ORATES
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Various housewives living on the 500
block of Waller street, between Steiner
and Pierce, declared that Special Po
liceman George Delmar was unneces
sarily vigilant when he detected John
J. Rogers and Cassius M. Parker in the
act of soliciting alms and that he was
unduly severe when he arrested them
for It. In their heart goodness the
matrons believed that the evidence of
physical disability displayed by Mr.
Rogers, to say nothing of the piteous
tale that accompanied the ex
position, entitled his mendicancy
to exemption from interference.
And as for Mr. Parker, the ex
cellent ladies said, it was simply in
human to restrain him from aiding an
afflicted fellow creature to beg the
necessaries of life, which a crippled
hand preventf-d him working to ob
tain.
In the court of Judge Mogan, how
ever, the policeman proved that his
capture of Messrs. Rogers and Parker
really was deserving of commendation
instead of censure from any honest
housewife. Indeed so thoroughly was
his acti<m vindicated that the defend
ants were sentenced to three months'
Imprisonment.
Mr. Rogers, it appeared, had painted
one of his hands with iodine and ac
quired the art of rigidly crooking the
fingtrs until they looked as if they
were irreparably gnarled. It was his
wont to summon a housewife to the
door of her dwelling, exhibit his un
lovely hand and spin a piteous tale of
how the member was burned while he
was rescuing a helpless babe from a
blazing house. While he was thus en
gaged Mr. Parker would casually gaun
ttt psst Ihe <toor, abruptly stop as if
he were haltea by the begsars petition.
advance and examine the painted hand,
express deep sympathy and deplore the
impecuniosity that prevented him giv
ing more material proof of his pity.
Wot youtse need, me pore fren'," he
would chokingly say. "is money enough
to- buy a peddlin' business of some
kind, an" its qic dat would gladly help
yniise jf 1 wasn't broke meself."
Then he would tenderly take the bo
Â£us deformity in his own hand and elo
quently elucidate to the housewife how
surgical science could not possibly re
st"].- it to titness for useful service.
And unless she were a housewife of
adamantine soul her purse would be
opened in response to the elucidation.
How many housewives had been thus
imposed on by Mr. Rogers and his busi
ness manager the policeman was un
able to estimate, but he believed the
Western Addition .>as toured by the
pair ere they entered the park district.
He had ascertained, also, that most of
the money obtained by them was ex
pended for beer.
Mr. Parker was tall, slender and
neavily mustached. while Mr. Rogers
was dumpy and apple faced. As they
confronted th<? bench their appearance
recalled the physical contrast that
made fame for two German comedians
and fortune for an OFarrell-street
playhouse.
Nervously nibbling at his finger nails,
Fred St. Clair mumbled that it was
neither alcohol nor opium, but dread
of a vengeful female that caused him
to disturb the peace. His nemesis, he
muttered, erroneously believed that he
had wronged her, and she made his life
a continuous shudder of apprehension.
Asked by Judge Fritz to disclose the
identity of his alleged pursuer so that
she might be restrained from chasing
him, Mr. St. Clair responded that he
would rather fdll by her hand than
subject her to the humiliation of ai
rest. Then he browsed more diligently
than ever t;n his digital points and the
court r<-manded him for further inves
tigation.
Mock Jo and Wong Chung, arrested
for fighting on Dupont street, informed
Judge Conlan, through an interpreter,
that they were only fooling and loved
each other as cousins. The accusing
policeman mutely directed the courts
attention to an ugly, gash on Wong
Chung's left eyebrow, and Wong
Chung readily explained that he had
received it by accidentally falling
against an iron balcony rail while he
was fooling with Mock Jo. The Judge
discredited the defense and will pass
sentence to-day.
Joseph Adam and Louis Allain. able
seamen, were indebted to John Cane,
boarding-master at 15 Vallejo street,
when they requested his permission to
remove their personal belongings to a
vessel on which they had shipped. He
declined to release the baggage until
his claim was settled, so they broke
into his baggage-room and transferred
their clothes bags thence to a stable.
Now they are accased of burglary and
Judge Mogan has continued the case
till next Friday.
Merrill Webster and John Lynch,
vagrants, who were released by Judge
Fritz last Wednesday on condition that
they immediately leave the city, re
appeared on a similar charge entered
by a Southern Pacific special officer
who found them asleep in an outgoing
box car.
"You told us to get out of town,"
said Mr. Webster to the Judge, "and
we were obeying your order when this
policeman stopped us."
"Try it again," said his Honor, "and
I would suggest that you cross the
boundary of this county before you
take a train. If isn't far from here to
San Mateo, and you look healthy
enough to walk the distance."
Olaf Hanson and Emil Anderson,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1905.
street mendicants, expressed their
wrath by spitting upon a sidewalk
when a passing pedestrian declined to
contribute to their support, and as he
would not prosecute them for begging,
the arresting policeman booked them
for violating the anti-expectoration or
dinance. Judge Conlan gave them
twenty-four hours apiece.
Gustave Barnson, who was arrested
while wooing Morpheus amid the fol
iage of a stately oak in Golden Gate
Park, will x^erforce abstain from tree
dwelling for thirty days, Judge Mogan
having sentenced him to imprisonment
for that period.
Robert E. Jackson, an infantryman,
was intoxicated and disorderly near the
Presidio and naughy little boys were
having fun with him when Patrolman
Sutton scooped him in. Judge Fritz
fined him $5.
When the bailiff of Judge Conlan's
court shouted "R. G. Godfrey," a big
man arose from amid the spectators
and yelled, "Here I am," stumbled for
ward and fell in a heap. He had been
arrested for drunkenness and released
on bail, and it evidently was a pro
longation of the same drunk that
caused his collapse in court. The
Judge ordered that he be kept in cus
tody until to-day.
Mrs. Georgia Harrington was
charged with vagrancy by her father,
but her husband expressed willingness
to "give her another chance," and
Judge Mogan dismissed her. Asked
why she preferred haunting the Bar
bary Coast to keeping house for an
industrious and indulgent spouse, she
said she dearly loved to waltz, and as

Arthur W. Wolfe, slender, spec

ly surprised by the evidence of civic
advancement reflected in his arrest
for violating the anti-expectoration
ordinance. He arrived direct from
Boston a week ago and while engaged
in a pedestrian tour of urban inspec
tion he deposited salivary offering
upon a sidewalk of Market street.
"Dear me," he exclaimed when Pa
trolman Nolan promptly collared him,
"is it possible that spitting upon the
footways is prohibited by law so far
west as this?" When this remark
was quoted to Judge Mogan he asked
Mr. Wolfe if spitting in public places
is tabooed in Boston.
"Most certainly it is," was the re
ply.
"Then why did you spit upon a.pub
lic thoroughfare in San Francisco?"
his Honor inquired.
"My dear sir," replied Mr. Wolfe,
"San Francisco is a long way from
Boston."
"That is so," acquiesced the
court. "From the hub of culture you
have transferred yourself to the tire,
but pray remember you are still on
the wheel. In these days of rapid
transit it is not such a far cry from
Massachusetts to California as it was
when you and I were boys and I was
at liberty, if you were not, to spit
where and when I pleased. You are
now at freedom to go forth and find
more astonishinp pro*ofs that we are
somewhat civilized, even if we are not
ho.iKting of it."

TIME TO OUST
THE GRAFTERS
Citizens of San Francisco Are
Bent on Better Manage
ment of Their Local Affairs
MUNICIPAL CAMPAIGN
Party Leaders Assert That
Primary Election Law Is
the Best Agency at Hand
Citizens deeply interested in affairs
of local government predict that the
municipal campaign in San Francisco
will open early this year and be con
ducted to the finish with a vim and
vigor that will surprise the oldest in
habitant.
In the several Assembly districts of
the city the political leaders of each
party are taking soundings to ascertain
the deptn oi public sentiment in favor
of a purely non-partisan ticket. The
campaign will probably open up in
good earnest soon after the Legislature
adjourns. It is remarked in every po
litical camp that the citizens intend to
make a strenuous contest for better
local government, but opinions vary as
to methods and details of organization.
The Republicans are naturally Uated
over the magnificent victory of last
November and many of the district
leaders contend that the party is strong
enough to cast out the bosses and call
a convention that will nominate a
ticket that cannot fail to command the
support of the best citizenship of the
metropolis.
A leading Republican yesterday re
viewed th?. situation in this fashion:
We have not had a Republican local ad
ministration since the adoption of the new
charter. fucler the plea of special knowledge
concerning the new charter the Democrats rode
into power ami for several years administered
the affairs of local government. Then the
Union Labor party got the upper hand and i<.r
nearly four years has handled the reins ot
authority.
GOVERNMENT IS BAD.
It Is admitted on all sides that the city is
not anything like as well governed now as it
was under the old consolidation act, but Urn
lai-t should f.e kept in mind that the new
charter has not yet been* tested under the
direction of a Mayor chosen by the Republican
party. In 1903 the Republican municipal con
vention cast out the bosses and save the peo
ple an opportunity to vote for Henry J
Crocker, hut the adroit politicians of the old
machine i.ulled the wool over the eyes ot the
merchants and thus brought about a division
of the forces that were standing for good gov
rmmt-nt and the rssult was the defeat of both
Republican and Democratic nominees. It is
doubtful whether a candidate more acceptable
than Mr. Crocker could be found to enter t..e
campaign for Mayor. His defeat did not sig
nify lack of confidence in his integrity or
lack of respect for his ability. It signified
however, that well-meaning Republican mer
chant.* took the advice of Democratic leaders
ami voted tor Mi. J.ane, who was not able to
<airy a single Assembly district of the city.
The ReuublHiin.^ are the most independent of
voters?. For example. James D. Phelan re
ceived his must pronounced majorities in the
strongest Republican Assembly districts and
hf was the straight-out candidate of the regu
lar Democratic party. The Republicans of
the city can be relied upon to support a good
Democrat in the evont of failure upon the part
of the Republican local convention to nominate
the. right kind of h man. In view of the re
sponsibilities of this coming campaign the Re
publican citizens of every Assembly district
should take the initiative In the battle for
honest and clean administration of local af
fairs. They ought to put in the Held such a
ticket as Democrats would be bound to sup
port. PhPlan. a Democrat, wag elected twice
by Republicans. Why should not Democrats
stand in i..r a good Republican Mayor?
DEMOCRATS ARE GUESSING.
In the Democratic camp there is a
deal of conjecture concerning the ap
proaching municipal campaign. An in
fluential Democratic leader inclines to
the opinion that good conventions can
be obtained through the agency of the
primary election law. He doubts the
wisdom of advising good citizens t<
keep away from the primary polls in
order to preserve their right to petition
for an independent place on the official
ballot. He fancies that the Republi
can and Democratic local conventions
might reach a common choice on a
candidate for Mayor.
There is an agitation in both Repub
lican and Democratic ranks for high
class conventions under the primary
election lew.
SHOULD CONSIDER TICKETS.
It is further suggested that a muni
cipal league or non-partisan council
should consider all tne regular party
nominations and give indorsement to
nominees whose election would guar
antee honest and capable administra
tion or their respective offices. It is
claimed that knowledge of such con
templated Indorsement would impel
both Republican and Democratic nom
inating bodies to select candidates of
exceptional ability and fitness.
The general trend of comment in all
political camps is to the effect that the
people of San Francisco are resolved
on better local government. It is the
live question. The race question in the
South, the atrocities in Bulgaria and
the peril of Japanese invasion may en
gage the attention of profound spe
cialists, but the vital popular issue in
San Francisco relates to the condition
of the streets and the management of
the various departments of the muni
cipal government. Citizens, irrespective
of party affiliation, hold that the time
has arrived tor the abolition of graft
and the expulsion of grafters.
DISASTROUS HINTING EXPEDI
TION.
The Messrs. Onion and their friend.
Mr. Murphy, started on a rabbit shoot
the other day. but scared up a Mtb
bit of unusual size, which turned the
tables on the erstwhile nimrods, with
the result that 3Lr. Murphy and his
companions lost their heads, which
went rolling down the hill, and the
whole affair ended in a rabbit stciv.

Commissioner Hcacock Finds That
Discharged Artilleryman Did
JSot Steal Trunk.
The charge against James Shelton
of having stolen a trunk, the property
of James McConnaha, was dismissed
by United States Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday. McConnaha testified
that he had sold the trunk to Shelton,
a discharged soldier of the Sixty
fourth Artillery, and that when Shel
ton did not come up with the money
he swore to a complaint for his ar
rest. Shelton is of good family in
Knoxville, Term., and left for home
last night.
Frank Sylvester, indicted for steal
ing and destroying a packet addressed
to Camilla King at San Lorenzo,
pleaded guilty yesterday in the United

CLEVER AMATEUR WHO WILX.
TAKK THE LEADING FART IN
"FRAU KOENIGIN."
"Frau Koenioin"
to Be Heard
To-Nioht.
To-night the dashing German com
edy, "Frau Koenigin," will be produced
at the Alhambra, with Miss Grace
Llewellyn Jones playing the leading
feminine role and Dr. Johannes Karl
Plincz, the distinguished German
scholar, the role of Gabriel yon Rosen
worth, the gay deceiver.
The play is said to be a delicious bit
of comedy, and both Miss Jones and
Dr. Plincz are amply capable of inter
preting it in fetching style.
Before the curtain's rise, and for the
benefit of those whose German is yet
to be acquired, Mrs. Charles Bundschu
will read a synopsis of the play.
The proceeds of the affair will be de

JOHN F. SEYMOUR WILL.
SUCCEED L.ATE J. B. HUME
Former Captain of Detectives to
Enter the Employ of Wells,
Fargo & Co.
John F. Seymour, for many years
connected with the local Police De
partment and latterly captain of the
detective force, has been appointed
special oflicer of Wells, Fargo & Co.
to fill the vacancy caused by the death
of Detective J. B. Hume. He will en
ter upon his duties on March 1, shar
ing with Detective Thacker the re
sj.onsibilit.es of the secret agents' de
1-artment.
Seymour's ability as a detective was
thoroughly proved for many years on
the force and during his occupancy of
the position of captain of detectives
on the local force and this fact car
ried great weight with the officials of
the express company in selecting a
successor to Hume. A few days ago he
was unexpectedly offered the position
and after careful consideration he ac
cepted it.
Custom-House Transfers.
Collector Stratton announces the fol
lowing transfers in the Custom-house:
D. J. Moynihan, assistant weigher at

Bispham at the Alhambra.
David Bispham will give the last
toncert of his series in the Alhambra
this afternoon. It is the first Bispham
matinee, as well, and should attract a
big audience. The dimensions of
Lyric Hall were found to be altogether
too limited to accommodate the num
ber of people who wanted to hear the
great barytone. The impression left
by Bispham's singing of the Tuesday
and Thursday concerts was a splendid
tribute to his great ability. His voice
never sounded better in grand opera
when he appeared here with the great
opera company brought to San Fran
cisco by Maurice Grau in 1900 and
1901.
Miracle Play to Be Repeated.
The Senior Dramatic Club of Santa
Clara College will repeat its production

again be brought to San Francisco.
The cast will contain James A. Bacig
alupi. William Johnson. William J.
McKagney and John Ivancovich and
all the other players who scored such
remarkable successes in their respec
tive roles.

"Our Martyred Presidents" was the
subject of a lecture by the Rev. J. H.
N. Williams at Simpson Memorial
Methodist Episcopal Church last night.
Mr. Williams reviewed the lives and
acts of Lincoln, Garfield and McKin
ley and told of the high aims and pa
triotism of each of the mourned Pres
idents. Before the lecture the assem
blage and choir joined in singing "My
Country 'Tis of Thee." The pulpit was
draped with the Stars and Stripes.
MANY INVALIDS
TURNED AWAY
City and County Hospital
and Alnvshouse Are Both
Crowded With Patients
COMPLAIN ABOUT FOOD
Nurses and Internes May
Strike if the Bill of
Fare Does Not Improve
The City and County Hospital and
: the Almshouse are crowded to their
j utmost capacity and many persons
have to be turned away daily. The
' city's- sick list seems to be on the in
! crease at an alarming rate and the
; destitute and ailing are making so
' many applications to the Board of
I Health that it is at its wits' end to
! know what to do.
The crowded condition of the two in
stitutions is not the. only difficulty that
! confronts the health officers. The
! nurses and i^ernes at the City and
! County Hospital, are beginning to com
i plain about the qjnality or food served
them and unless the bill of fare
changes soon there is likely to be a
strike at the hospital.
An average of seven or eight perstms
ire turned away daily from the City
and County Hospital. About thirty
five or forty are sent to that institution
each week. The health department can
. generally find, a way to accommodate
any one who is very ill or in need of
' immediate medical attention, but the
vast army ot' sufferers who are simply
worn out or complaining: or slight ail
ments finds it harder to break into
the public institution than can be
I imagined.
At the Almshouse the condition of
affairs is nearly as deplorable. An
average of five or six deserving appli
cants have to be turned away from
that institution daily. There is a
dearth of beds for women. As a gen
eral rule the male patients soon tire
of the monotony that prevails at the
home. of the public charges and quit
the place after a brief stay. It is dif
ferent with the women. They all seem
content at the Almshouse and,conse
quently, it is impossible to accommo
date the large number who make daily
applications for admission.
SAYS HE WAS BEATEN.â James Mcln
tyre. who lives at SKI Mission street. was
treated at the Emergency Hospital yesterday
for injuries to his head and face. He told
Dr. Hilt that he had been beaten by an un
known man whom he met at Fourth and Bran
man streets some time during the early morn
ing hours, and that the assailant robbed him
of $323. Mclntyre was intoxicated.

Rev. Dr. W. C. Pond Retires
From Old Bethany Church
Amid Expressions of Love
SHOWN HIGH HONORS

Record Esteem for Divine
and Wife in Resolutions
A remarkable reception was given
to the Rev. W, C. Pond, D. D., last
night on the occasion of his retiring
from the pastorate of Bethany Con
gregational Church after a service
there of thirty-one years. The church
was crowded with old and young*

Pond, principal of the High School,
Oakland, their sons, and Mra. Arthur
Rhodes, a daughter. Mrs. Helen
Searles. another daughter, living- in
Nevada, was unable to be present.
The most interesting part of the
the notable affair was the reading of a
set of resolutions which the members
of Bethany Church had unanimously
passed. These told of the regret ex
perienced at the retirement of Dr.
Pond and expressed the highest ap
preciation of the long years of labor
both the doctor and his beloved wife
had given to the welfare of the church.
The address was handsomely bound
and presented to Dr. Pond by A. P.
Ruch.
A. W. Gunnison. on behalf of the
members of the church and a num
ber of Christian Chinese of the city,
presented Dr. Pond with a purse.
Dr. Pond in acknowledging the
honors paid him and Mrs. Ponil
overwhelmed with so great an evi
(Jrnce of love from those with whom
he had been so long and closely asso
ciated.
The church was beautifully deco
rated with Bermuda and calla lilies
and greenery and above the pulpit was
the inscription, â¢1874 â Our Pastor â â 
1905."
A musical and literary programme
was rendered by Mrs. Richard G. El
rick. Miss Hilda Chamberlain. Miss
Daisy Veaco, Paul E. Kritch and Irv

however, the merry throng of pleasure seekers

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 24.
Tired of waiting longer for her hus
band, who for seven years has been
prospecting near Colfax for gold,
Christina Lewis this afternoon charged
him with desertion and told Judge Hall
that he had failed to give her any sup
port.
They were married at San Francisco
in 1879 and have three children. Her
husband's name is W. S. Lewis, and he
is still digging for the gold that so far
has never materialized. The hearing
was continued until Tuesday.
Mary Butler was granted an inter
locutory degree of divorce from
Thomas Butler, former business agent
for the Carpenters' Union, this morn
ing on the grounds of habitual intem
perance and cruelty. He said his dizzy
sjh-Hs which caused him sometimes to
fall from a chair or lied were the re
sult of a fall he sustained some years
ago. The Judge said something about
a fall off a water-wagon and granted
the wife her petition and $22 50 a month
alimony.
Suit for divorce on the ground of
cruelty was begun to-day by Gabriel
Y. Moraga. after whom Moraga Valley
was named, against Ella F. Moraga of
Berkeley. He says she kicked him and
c,alled him an Indian. They have seven
children. May J. Nelson has asked for
a divorce from Oscar Nelson on the
ground of desertion. They had only
been married a short time, when one
day he left her. A final decree of di

the ground of desertion.
â¢MIKADO" SING BY
IMVKRSITY AMATEURS
I'rytanean Society Scores Hit on Stapc,
Rendering Lyrics and Lines of
Famous Opera.
BERKELEY, Feb. 24.â Gilbert and
Sullivan's comic opera, "The Mikado,"
was produced to-night at the Mac
donough Theater in Oakland by the
Prytanean Society of the university
for the benefit of the university hospi
tal fund. The theater was crowded to
overflowing. The production scored
more than the hit usually made by
college performers before a college
audience. The attempt to render in
fitting style the music and lines of the
opora was more ambitious than most
dramatic essays of amateurs, and the
success achieved by the Prytaneans
was accordingly the more notable.
Professor Walter Magee appeared as
the Mikado, his splendid voice and fine
stage presence making one of the most
striking bits of work in the produc
tion. The three little maids from
school were Ethel Meredith, Marguerite
Shoecraft and Mary Ratcliff. Miss
Clara L. Cooper was the Katisha of
the east and Edwin Rust Ko-ko. Ed
gar Stern sang the part of Pooh-bah,
Chester Moore Pish-tush and MeCul
louph Graydon Xanki-poo.
The chorus, drilled by Clinton R.

Contest Against Testament
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 24.
Failure to tell two witnesses that the
document they were signing their
names to was his will resulted in the
setting aside to-day of what purported
to be the will of the late George D. Hall
of 2246 San Jose avenue, Alameda, in
which he leaves his entire estate to his
wife, and his brother Henry H. Hall
and his sister Helena Crocker in conse
quence are each entitled to an eighth
of $13,822 72 cash in bank.
Hall deeded all his real estate in the
city of Alameda to his. wife prior to his
death, but the money in bank he left
her in a sort of bill of sale, which he
had E. L. Reese and Charles H. Hubbs
of San Francisco witness, telling them
at the time that fby the paper his wife
would ; get all that he > had at his death.
This I was held ;by Judge Ogden not to
be . in accordance with the law, and : he
refused fto admit; it !to j probate. Notice
of appeal to the Supreme - Court was
given; the attorneys basing their hopes
on the fact that while the deceased did
not say the ' document was his will his
language will be construed to be equiv

Says Breaking of Marriage
Bonds Sometimes Saves
Souls of Wedded Slaves
Berkeley Office San Francieco Call,
214* Center street, Feb. 24.
Four distinguished representatives of
the educational, the civil and the re
ligious life of the community spoke
this evening at St. Marks Epis
copal Church on "Phases of the
Divorce Problem." Addresses were
delivered, by invitation of the
Rev. E. L. Parsons, the rector, by
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
State University, Mayor Warren Olney
of Oakland and the Rev. C. R. Brown
of the First Congregational Church of
Oakland. Bishop William Ford Nich
ols, one of the Invited speakers, waa
absent because of illness and sent a
letter of regret. Among other things
President Wheeler said:
Without home, society is a farce, civilization
worse than confusion. After all, we have to
come back to the woman as the fountain and
the mainspring of all goodness, of everything
that is spiritual and ethereal and conserva
tive In society. Woman is the conservator of
our civilization. I am praying every day
for more of the good old-fashioned women,
educated as our mothers were, in the old
fashioned way, whose home was their king
dom and whose kingdom was their home.
Mayor Olney of Oakland defended
divorce in cases where evident good
resulted from severance of matrimonial
bonds, he said:
I recall three cases that came within my
experience as a lawyer and citizen where three
women obtained divorces, and In each ca*e the
woman was released from a galling bond that
fettered her life and warped h^r soul. Each
woman remarried, and the marriage of each
wao hapry. There was blessing as a result,
and the souls ot those women in the broader
sfnse were saved by their divorces and re
marriage. You will Judge, then, that I ap
prove of divorce when It op/erat<-s In cases like
the three I mention. But I believe divorce
should be applied for with caution, granted
with scrupulous care, and only when an of
ne^r of the court, representing soctety, has
made a special investigation of the petition for
divorce, and given the court a report, inde
pendent of the testimony offered by witnesses
before the Judge. I believe that a uniform di
vorce law would be a decided advantage to
society.
Rev. C. R. Brown, as a representa
tive of the church, denounced that
falÃe liberty which permitted more
than 25,000 divorces in one year in thi*
country, against 20,000 in all of Europe
in the same year. He cited England's
record of 528 divorces in a year, com
paring it with the 25,000 in America,
and charged the difference to the craze
for individual freedom, degenerating
into license.
VERDI BENEFIT CONCERT
IS A SUCCESSFUL EVENT
Audience Is Large and Instrumental
Performers and Vocalists Win
Great Applause.
More than 200 local instrumental
performers and singers were on the
Alhambra stage last evening at the
Verdi monument fund benefit con
cert. There were two conductors,
Minetti and James Hamilton Howe of
the Howe Club. In addition to the
orchestra and chorus three of the
artists of a former Tivoli grand opera
season, Mme. Roma and Signors Cor
tesi and Borghese, together with Mrs.
Edith Scott- Basford, contralto, and
Miss Grace Freeman, violinist, ap
peared. The audience was large and
enthusiastic. The programme as pre
viously published was adhered to
without change. This included of
Verdi the "Nabucco" and "Sicilian
Vespers" overtures, the quartet from
"Rigoletto" and the finale of act three
of "Ernani."
Of course the great piece was the
"Rigoletto" quartet, with Roma. Mrs.
Kcott-BHPford. Cortesi and Borghese.
The orchestra and chorus were very
effective jointly in the march and cho
rus from "Tannhauser." The orches
tra was large and entirely satisfactory.
The- chorus work, in addition to the
"Tannhauser" number, included a
chorus from "Paradise Lost," by Du
bois; the "Ernani" scene and two un
accompanied numbers. Miss Grace
Freeman distinguished herself partic
ularly in the allegro of a Saint-Saens
concerto. In addition to the numbers
already mentioned the orchestra had
two for strings alone, one of which,
the minuet by Belzoni, has been
played by the orchestra before. In
the "Ernani" number Borghese was
the soloist.
HAWAIIAN ISLAM) VOLCANO
IX STATE OF ERUPTION
Manila Loa Is Once More Belch-
ing; Out FlHmes and
Alolten Lava.
A cablegram from Hilo says the
great volcano Mauna Lioa. in the
Hawiian Islands, has again broken out
and is now in a state of eruption. It
is emitting great volumes of smoke,
flames and molten lava.
The sight at night is said to be a
superb one. The great flames shoot
hiyh into the air, anywhere from 500
to 1000 feet. Hilo, which is twenty
fuur miles distant, is in no danger.
Mauna Loa has been practically quiet
for many years. During the last erup
tion crowds from all parts of the
country went to see the gorgeous
pyrotechnical display. The brilliant
flumes, while of a moat livid
hue, at times embrace every
color of the rainbow. The present
spectacle is as brilliant as its predeces
sor. From the meager details of the
cablegram it is believed that the erup
tion will be as extensive as that which
made Kllauea a burning mountain,
filled with lakes of fire and rivers of
lava, in 1893.
Skull Fractured on Pavement.
Frank Raymond, an ex-policeman,
is lytn* at the Harbor Hospital in a
precarious condition, suffering from a
fractured skull, and Augustine Ro
manl is at the City Prison, held pend
ing the result of Raymond's injuries.
Roman! says that he and two other
Italians approached Raymond at the
corner of Merchant and Montgomery
streets last night and asked him for a
match. Raymond made a move for
his hip pocket, and Romani. thinking:
he was going to be shot, struck Ray
mond, knocking him to the sidewalk.
Raymond's head struck the sidewalk
and he lay inert. The three men made
no attempt to get away, but failing

DEATH'S CAUSE
IS A MISTERY
Physicians Fail to Discover
AVhat Suddenly Ended the
Life of Old-Time Boniface
CHEMIST INVESTIGATES
Coroner Melmiiann Post
pones Inquest Pending Ke
]>ort on the Chapeland Case
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Feb. 24.
Autopsy surgeons have been unable
to find what caused the death of Peter
Chapeland, a pioneer hotel-keeper who
died suddenly on Wednesday after
noon at his residence, 854 Sixty- first
street. â¬hap*land's death followed al
most immediately after he had eaten
a light noonday meal. He had been
conversing with his wife and two
friends shortly before he left the table.
A few minutes afterward he fell un
conscious in the garden at the rear of
the house. Dr. H. N. Rowell waa call
ed, but Chapeland waa dead before the
physician arrived. Asthma was sup
posed to have been the trouble.
Coroner Mehrmann took charge of
the case and ordered an autopsy. Dr.
Rowell and Dr. Ellis made the exam
ination, but were unable to find suffi
cient evidence upon which to give a
decision.
The hyoid bone in the neck waÂ»
fractured, but ;his injury wa3 not of
a fatal character. In view of the sur
geons' report Coroner Mehrmann has
ordered a rhemical analysis of the
contents of the stomach. The Coroner
has postponed the inquest until
Wednesday, March 1, pending the
chemist's investigations. Chapeland
for many years conducted a resort at
Golden Gate, where epicures could
tickle their palates with fine wines and
dainty morsels.

Two ferry steamers lost themselves
yesterday morning in the fog and re
d their bearings only when they
<r ashed against the State property
iÂ»rdering the water front. The Gar
den City on her 7 o'clock trip from
< >akland. in command of Captain
James McLean, missed her slip on this
side and knocked away such of the dol-
BB Mission street wharf as the
steamer Centennial and other wander
ing coasters have left unsmashed. The
SausaJito, Captain Johnson, on her 6:45
trip from Sausalito, wandered off hr
Bt and rammed the end of Broad
vay wharf No. 2. The limbers of the
Fausalitos paddle-box were crushed
and for a few minutes wharf and ferry
were locked in a tangle. Some of
the Sausalitos passengers jumped
ashore, but the majority stayed with
the steamer until she reached her slip.
Nobody was injured in either acci
dent.
Surprise Astonishes Her Pilot.
The Peterson launch Surprise, in charge of
Engineer Fred Johnson, started out at 3
o'clock yesterday morning for Emeryville.
About the time the Key Route pier should have
been looming up through the fog the launch
â went ashore with a crash. When the fog
lifted Johr.eon found that he had been trying
to buck .â¢ Santa Fe breakwater in the China
BaElr. Without compass and unable to take
any bearings on account of the fog, John
con had wondered off his course and instead
of heading Zcr Emeryville the launch had
turned completely around and stranded on the
eide of the bay that Johnson supposed was
far astern. The receding tide left the Sur
prise high and dry and it was late yesterday
afternoon before ehe M floated off.
Lindstedfs Wild Ride.
William Llndstedt. who lives at 967 Mis
eion street, accepted the offer of a ride yes
terday on one of Pierce. Rudolph & Co.'s
wapons. At Broadway and Battery street the
horses ran away. The driver Jumped to the
ground, leaving Lindstedt to the mercy of the
galloping steed*. A sudden swerve dislodged
the abandoned passenger and overboard he
liitcht-d. cutting open his scalp and bruising
his back. The horses continued their gallop
to East street, through the gates of Broadway
wharf No. 2, and only when they reached the
end of the wharf did they stop. Lindstedt's
injuries were attended to at the Harbor Hos
pital.

SISTER FILES
WILL CONTEST
Louise Bee Alleges That
Mrs. Hoover Was Unduly
Influenced by Husband
THREATS OF DESERTION
Contestant Says the Man
Demanded Property on
the Day of His Marriage
With pointed charges that Marie E.
Hoover was influenced to make a will
and to deed more than 5100.000 worth
cf property to her husband, George S.
Hoover, a few days after their mar
riage, Louise Bee, sister of the de
ceased, yesterday filed a contest of the
will. She sets forth cnat she is the
only surviving sister Qf Mrs. Hoover
and is her heir at law.
At the time of making the testament,
says the contestant, Mrs. Hoover was
under the undue influence of her
husband. On the day of their mar
riage, October 4 last, it is charged,
Hoover induced his wire to make the
will and bequeath only one dollar to
the sister. It is alleged that the hus
band of a dty told his wife that unless
she made the will and deeded her prop
erty to him he would not live with her.
Believing that he would carry this
threat into effect, and in fear of the
humiliation to which she would be sub
jected, Mrs. Hoover, it is charged, on
the following day made the will and
within two weeks delivered a deed con
veying her property absolutely o-n her
death to Hoover.
Mrs. Hoover was married three times
and was the mother or Harry Poole,
who was shot by the mother of Truly
Shattuck, then a Tivoli chorus girl.
Hoover was a newspaper carrier, con
siderably younger than the woman,
and it has been surmised that she mar
ried him for the purpose of preventing
the sister from receiving any of her
property. The sisters, as the Gerlach
heirs, had previously been in legal
warfare over the property "at the cor
ner of O'Farrell and S^ckton streets,
and their controversy \ms finally com
promised. Bert Schlesinger is attorney
for Mrs. Bee. Sullivan & Sullivan rep
resent Hoover.
SCENES FROM CHILDHOOD.
Eugene Field in his poem entitled
"Seem* Tilings" gives a remarkably
true picture of a youngster's dream,
but the realities a small boy encoun
ters are even more interesting and will
be found well illustrated in next Sun
day's comic.
W*hite Wants Goods Back.
H. S. white, an iron dealer, 132
Beale street, yesterday afternoon ap
plied to the Sheriff's office to obtain

a lot of scrap iron from in front of
"White's premises several days ago and
it is at present in the corporation
yard. The board informed White that

ment.

SON OF YOELL
NEGLECTS WIFE
Refuses to Support Child
Unless She Promises to
Begin Action for Divorce
TIES UP HIS LEGACY
Deserted Woman Restrains
Him From â¢ Transferring
Share in Father's Estate
To the Yoell family troubles aired In
the trial of the will contest now in pro
gress in Judge Kerrigan's court spice
is added by the suit for maintenance
begun yesterday by Doretta T. Yoell
against Herbert Alexander Yoell, son
of the pioneer attorney over whose for
tune his children are now at war.
The wife sets forth that they were j
married on July 8, 1896, and that he '
abandoned her in 1838. After his deser- j
tion a son was born, Laurence Yoell,
now 6 years old. From February, 1SÂ»8. ;
Yoell has been living in New York,
where he is said to be in receipt of an
abundant salary, but he has not con
tributed to his wife's support, though
until a year ago he sent $5 a week for
the maintenance of his child. He then
refused to continue his small contribu
tion unless Mrs. Yoell would bring a
suit for divorce. This she declines to ;
do and she asks the court to compel
him to support her and give security to
guarantee that he will obey any order I
the court might make. She also asks !
that a receiver be appointed to take
charge of his share in his father's es- |
tate, as she is informed that he intends
to assign it to some one in order to de
feat her claims. Judge Kerrigan has
issued a temporary restraining order
preventing any such transfer, pending
a hearing on March 3.
Judge Hebbard yesterday ordered
Alex R. Anderson, a saloon man, to pay
his wife $25 by next Monday or go to
jail. Anderson has sued for divorce
and his wife has made a cross-com
plaint, alleging that Anderson, who is
twenty years her senior, married her in
order to get $3000 she had, which he
has invested in a saloon.
Tillie Ferguson sued Daniel M. Fer- '
guson for divorce and $100 a month ali
mony. They were married in 1896. and
since then his favorite form of abuse
has been, she says, to kick her black
and blue. He is particularly violent
when he has lost at gambling.
Mildred Ford wants to end the cruel
ty of John W. Ford, which culminated
February 18 when he threw a clock at
her. On that occasion she called the
police and left him. Ford owns the
liquor and grocery business of Ford &
Donovan, at Page and Octavia streets, 1
which is said to be worth $7000 and pro- j
duces an income of $500 a month.
Mary A. McCormick. married twenty
two years ago, wants a divorce from
Martin J McCormick. a butcher, on the
ground of cruelty.
Judge Murasky yesterday annulled
the marriage of Fusakichi Hadano and
Chlyano Hadano on the ground of the
wife's physical condition.
ROHTEN SYME IS ARRESTED.â Officer
TJnger of the Humane Society arrested Rohten

THE NORTH SEA AFFAIR.
PRELIMINARY outgivings indicate that the court of inquiry
into the North Sea incident will find practically in favor ol
Russia. The verdict does not affirm the presence of Japanese
torpedo-boats, but. it is reported, will declare that the Russian naval
officers were justified in firing upon the trawlers as a precaution
against possible attack. If this be the verdict it will meet a stormy
reception in the British press, and will not find much favor on this
j-ide of the water. .
It was obviously the duty of Russia to know whether hostile
ships were in those waters, so many thousand miles from the scene
of hostilities. Japanese torpedo-boats could not possibly carry there
the coal necessary for their use. They could not possibly have been
built and launched anywhere in Europe without being identified in
advance. All of the probabilities were against their presence in the
North Sea. Therefore to say that the war fleet of Russia was justi
rled in firing upon fishing boats and killing their crews, as a military
precaution, is to trifle with the issue.
Great Britain accepted arbitration as an alternative for war and
agreed to abide by the result, and will do so, as far as the Govern
ment is concerned," in good faith. The people, however, will not share
its policy of submission. They will be bitterly antagonistic and the
!*sue will be carried into politics. Upon a motion of inquiry in the
House of Commons there will be a feeling responsive to the popular
aversion, and the Ministry may lose power as a result. This will
make the affair a burning issue in the parliamentary elections to fol
low a dissolution. The people of England are intensely sympathetic
with their sailors and their seagoing interests. These have made
( ireat Britain what she is commercially, and offensively and defen
sively as a military power. The right little, tight little island would
be inconsequential in the world except for her jack tars. Being
jealous of their safety and their rights, the people will not accept as
a permanent policy and a right verdict the conclusion that a war
fleet of a friendly power may at will run amuck among a British
commercial fleet, as a precaution against a naturally impossible at
tack.
The event, added to the seizure and the sinking of British mer
chantmen by the Black Sea auxiliaries, which passed the Bosphorus
in violation'of treaty obligations, will stir John Bull to wrath, and
justly so. The British Government is readily responsive to public
ieeling, and in that respect its mechanism is as sympathetic as our
own. Americans have the same feeling about their ships and their
sailors. There would have been no Spanish war except for the de
struction of the Maine in Havana harbor. That act stirred American
feeling as it had never been stirred before. The anger was focused
in Congress and no administration could have withstood it The
- did not stop to inquire critically into the agency of Spain in
the destruction of the ship. A Spanish man-of-war had just visited
New York and had anchored in safety in our waters. The visit of
the Maine was a naval courtesy in return, and she lost her life in
Spanish waters. That was enough. We felt the impulse of our
character as a maritime nation and flew at the throat of Spain re
gardless of our own preparation for war, but confident that in the
long run we could amply pnni# our enemy.
Looking back at the state of American feeling at that time we
may measure the provocation that the English people will have for
an outburst of feeling over such a verdict as is rumored in the case
of the trawlers. The British Government will no doubt itself make
restitution for the lives and property of its subjects. But that will
not appease the discontent that will not down until in some form the
nation has made it even with Russia.
No matter what governments may do, the people of every mari
time nation will sympathize with the view of the British public. The
greatest interest in international law centers around the rights of
neutrals in war. There is a constant and irresistible pressure toward
relieving neutral commerce of the risks and exactions of war in which
it has no concern. The supposed verdict is a long step backward.
If the merchant ships of neutrals are to be fired upon at will by the
\\ arships of a belligerent on the suspicion that they may be enemies
in disguise, and the attacking party cannot be held to any responsi
bility for a mistake, then any war between maritime powers may
the uhole world.
Under such conditions, if such a verdict be accepted by gov
ernments as a precedent, settling a principle, neutral commerce has
no protection and becomes impossible. The mercantile interests of
the world will not accept such a conclusion. Commerce does not
make war. It makes peace. Under the rules regulating. the rights of
belligerents heretofore neutral commerce has had heavy burdens to
bear and has been subjected to great risks. It will bear no further
exactions. v
PLANNING STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
IN the expenditure of money appropriated under the bond issue for
a proper street system San Francisco is fortunate in having the
expert advice of Architect D. H. Burnham and his enthusiastic
ants of the Association for the Improvement and Adornment of
San Francisco. This city has suffered from lack of knowledge of
the best methods to be used in street work, and has made costly ex
periments which could have been obviated with the aid of such
advice.
Even in laying out the streets originally our estimable fore
fathers used the hurry-up method of drawing off squares on paper
with a ruler rather than to study the natural lines and elevation of
the townsite and then run the streets along the lines of least re
sistance. Had such a study been made some of their descendants
would not now, in order to reach home, be under the necessity of
scaling a cliff intended for a street or have the esthetic privilege of
watching grass grow among cobbles that can never be reached by
any horse but a pegasus.
There has never been a time when good streets were so much
of a necessity as now. The spirit of the time, with its increase in
the number and variety of vehicles, requires rapid and comfortable
transit. That can only be obtained on clean and well paved streets.
The work of permanent improvement in contemplation covers many
miles of thoroughfares, and the questions of repair, repaying, the
right kind of pavement for a given traffic, and proper care after com
pletion, should all be given most careful consideration, and sugges
tions or plans offered by those of recognized ability on the subject
will be of much value.
From the days when De Lesseps first began to think about It the Panama
ranal undertaking has been full of mysteries. The American people have the
right to ask that these mysteries be cleared up before they are asked to put
their money into the work. â New York Times.
It will not be denied by the bar of any Btate that collusion la close to
the root of "the divorce evil," now receiving such general discussion, or that
a considerable percentage of divorces are collusively obtained. â St. Louia Re

BREAD FALLACY
The fallacy that the whiter the bread
the higher its quality seems to prevail
all over the world, and the demands
for snow-white flour have been an
swered by the production of a flour
which Is robbed of considerable of its
nutritive value. There are various
ways of accomplishing this object, but
the newest and most novel process for
the purpose comes from France. Here
the dough has been treated with
ozonized air, and the effect was that
while the bread was nuch whiter than
the untreated the quality of the bread
â was very much impaired. Both the
taste and the amount of nourishment
were very much Inferior.
RACING AGAINST ODDS.
One of the late Professor Huxley's
best stories is of an Irish painter who
was observed covering the Bide of a

plied at a furious rate of speed. A

dent haste, inquired the cause of his
hurry-
"Sure," replied the Irishman, glanc
ing uneasily at his half-empty bucket,
"Oi'm trying to finish me worrk on
this wall before the paint runs out."

PAVEMENTS AND CORNS
""Well, the only thing I'm hoping
for," said the chiropodist, as he let
in his nineteenth customer Tuesday
morning, "is that the city of Chicago
will never take a notion to pave Its
streets smoothly. These cobble stones
are the making of the chiropodist's
business. You may not believe that,
but Just think . for a moment. You
walk across the street, slipping on the
rough stones at every step. Ever no
tice how it hurts your reet every time
you take a step. Result is corns, bun
ions, crooked toes, and a trip to the
chiropodist. If the streets were
smoothly paved we wouldn't have half
the business we now have. I'll gamble
that the inventor of the cobble stone
was a corn doctor." â Chicago Inter

WHEN the maid opened the
door in response tÂ© Holland
er's tug at the bell he walked
into the little consultation
room and ensconced himself
comfortably in a chair near the win
dow.
"Tell Dr. Allen I'd like to see her
at once, if you will," he said pleas
antly. "No! Never mind the name.
Just a patient." â¢
As the maid withdrew Hollander
glanced about the room. Everywhere
were medical books and technical
magazines. A grinning skull and a
yellowed femur reposed on the man
telpiece and on a neighboring table
was a sealed jar containing a human
brain. Hollander grunted his dis
gust. He was loth to associate Ce
celia Allen with these things. The
idea of women invading the profes
sions â especially such women as Ce
celia â was extremely distasteful to
his mind. He rose and. crossing the
room, stood before a framed diploma,
reading in Latin phrases, which an
nounced with all the ponderous dig
nity of steel engraving and crinkled
parchment that Cecelia Madison Al
len was a full-fledged M. D.
Standing thus, with his back to the
door, he did not see Cecelia enter the
room.
"Good afternoon," she said in her
best professional manner.
Hollander turned.
'Hello, Cecelia," he said with cheer
ful informality.
"Oh, it's only you!" she said.
"Well," he said In challenge, "can't
I have troubles as well as any one
else? Haven't I as much right as the
next man to summon medical aid?"
Cecelia regarded him doubtfully.
"Did you really come for medical
advice?" she asked.
'I really did," he asserted gravely.
"Can't sleep. Worry all the time.
Lost my good nature and feel broken
up generally.'"
"Indigestion," she declared. "Aren't
you smoking too much?"
"Your diagnosis is all wrong-." said
he. "The trouble is with my heart."
"Indeed!" she said frowning slight-
"Even so," he affirmed. "And what
is more, it's a sad case."
â¢ Cecelia's frown deepened.
"You'd better consult a specialist,"
she advised.
"You're the only one who would
understand the case," hÂ© said. "Do
you suppose I want to go to a special
ist and tell him I'm troubled with an
obstinate case of unrequited affec
tion?"
"So that's it," she said wearily.
"Yes, that's it." he returned. "I
know of only two methods of treat
ment â matrimony or cold poison."
"I don't approve of either," she
said.
"I dont fancy the cold poison my

"You didn't come here to propose

"I came here to ask you honestly if
you're satisfied with this sort of thing;
if you really and truly are making a

Ceceiia glared at him.
"You're very brave," she said sar

DISTRICTS ARE BUSY
Progress ol Various Sections Is Reported
to Be Profitable and Promising.
The special feature of the time con- i
nected with mining in California is
the series of reports that come in re
garding the several districts. These
:-re generally satisfactory. Consider
able progress Is noted in many direc
tions.
In the Greenwood district In El
Dorado County the Santa Claus Mining
Company has been organized to oper
ate, with 100,000 paid up capital, ac
cording to the Georgetown Gazette.
The property of the company has been
worked before, but it will now go on
a' larger scale. In the same district
development work is proceeding at the
Oliver Quartz mine. The mine is
owned by Mrs. Sarah J. de la Mon
tanya, who is developing the mine with
her own capital. Several good pros
pects axe to be developed by indivi
duals in Greenwood.
In the Humbug district In Slsklyou
County the McKinley quartz mine has
been leased to William Jamison, to be
developed. The Mono quartz property,
otherwise known as the old Punch
Creek claim, will resume during the
coming month. Eastern people have
bended placer ground at the mouth
of Vesey Creek, in the Virginia Bar
District. Operators are drilling for
prospects In the Oro Fino district.*
In the Forest Hill district in Placer
County, so reports the Placer Herald,
mining operations at Bath are pro
ceeding on an unusually large scale.
The Paragon mine has been working
steadily for four months. The prop
erty has been leased from T. W.
Browne of San Francisco. Good re
turns from the Grennell & Rush
hydraulic mine are reported. The
<Jaylord mine has been leased by E.
C. Gaylord and others.
In Trinity County the Qulmby mine,
On Quimby Creek, has been developed.
A stamp mill will be operated next
menth. According to the Amador
ledger, a rich strike has been made
in the Gwin mine. Prospecting at the
Treadwell continues.
TEARING DOWN" COVVERTERS.
The Redding Searchlight reports
that the converters at the Keswick
smelter of the Mountain Copper Com
pany are to be torn down and to be
removed to the new plant of the com
pany in Contra Costa County. The
Searchlight says concerning this move:
The fact that the converters are to be re
moved Is no surprise. For years the company
chipped Its low-grade matte to Elizabethtown.
N. J.. where it was treated at a refinery.
With reduction works. including a refinery, so
<-lo!>e at h&ad as Bulls Head Point, the matte
produced by the one furnace that it promises
to keep in operation at Keswick can be treated
*>conoinically. It certainly will no longer have
need of the number of converter stand* it had
at Keswick. when three of its five furnaces
were often in operation at the same time. An
important pipe line is now being taken up at
the smelter in Kecwick. These changes going
on in th* smelter town cause treat concern to
the Deople who have property Interests at
Flake.
The Amador Record says that a
ledge has been discovered in the Pio
neer district, in Amador County, that
assays $40 to the ton.
The Angels Record says that C. D.
Lane will soon personally superintend
the Utica Company's mining interests
in Calaveras County and that L. V.
i>hinn will go to Alaska to supervise
Alaskan properties in which Lane is
interested. It is also reported on the
Fame authority that new ground will
be opened south of the Angels An
nex.
An article was recently published in
The Call relating to the peat resources
in California. According to the Min
ing World, published at Chicago, the
peat deposits of Canada are estimated
to cover nearly 37.000 square miles,
exclusive of those of British Colum
bia and the Yukon country. The Min
ing World says in part:
The average depth of tb.es* deposits is from
five to ten feet. In addition to these Canadian
areas of Deat there are considerable deposit*
in the Northern States on the American Â»tdÂ«
of the line. These figures give some idea of
the great possibilities In the utilization of this
product for fuel purposes when a satisfactory
snd sufficiently cheap process of treatment
becomes available. European countries as yet
Ktm to have made more of a success of the
manufacture of peat tnto fuel, and in come in
stances it is used for the manufacture of tex
tile products, such as mats, baskets, etc. In
Russia and France peat is made Into cloth for
medical and eurgica.l purposes on account of
It* antiseptic properties, and in England the
use cf the fiber for paper making is being con
sidered. The experiments with peat In Can
ada have been more extensive than In the.
I'nited States, but it cannot yet be eald that
th*> problem of its utilization for fuel in Can-
Bda or the United States has been solved so
as to make the operation an assured financial
success. . â  .

FAILING EYESIGHT
Caused by Improper Food.
Writers who live sedentary lives and
vho use coffee are apt to be troubled
by faulty vision, which they usually
tribute to overwork. Tint they are
sometimes mistaken is proved by the
following statement from an old news-
paper man:
For nearly 40 years I have earned
my living with the pen. A lew years
ago I began to suffer from occasional
blind spells.' My vision frequently be-
came obscured .by what may be called
kaleidoscopic blurs. in which constant-
ly changing figures like wheels, stars,
etc.. f oated before my eyes, making it
gsiole for me to work while th*y
lasted. They were usually followed by
dull, heavy headaches.
â¢My physicians, two of them, ad-
visw? roe that my eyes had become
wr aliened by overwork. I consulted
an rtulist, but he could not discover
the cause of the trouble. I bought
stronger glasses, but they did not help
me.
"Last cummer, while living tempora-
rily in a boarding-house, I found the
very weak coffee a thing to complain
of, till suddenly I discovered that my
blind spells' were becoming less fre-
quent. I then satisfied myself by ex-
periments that it was coffee that was
deranging my optic nerves.
A friend advised me to try Postum
coffee, and although I had no faith in
it. I began to use it. In three days' time
the 'blind spells' completely ceased.
Going back to the old coffee the 'blind
spells' returned. * I am entirely satisfied
that coffee was the cause of the all-
ment, and that Postum was its cure."
Name given by Postum Co., . Battle
Creek. Mich. â --
There's a reason. Coffee is a narcotic
that breaks down the cells in the nerve
centers and unless nature succeeds In
repairing the damage each day disease
and distress follow : in some one or
more organs. . It may : be eyes , in ' one,
stomach and bowels ; In another, heart
or kidneys in : another, and yet each af-
fected from the same cause, coffee. The
sure way -to certainly know jis; to ; quit
coffee 10 days and use Postum. If , the
disease begins to disappear you have
the key to your puzzle. . " -|^ #%
shares to be sold to a gullible public,
the subject of mining fakes is also
under consideration in Colorado. Ac
cording to the Mining World, the Col
orado State Geologist has suggested
to the Governor of Colorado that
blanks shall be issued by the State
Geologist to mining companies, call
ing for comprehensive statements in
regard to property, development and
finances. The statement is not to be
compulsory. The World argues that
all legitimate mining companies would
be glad to take advantage of the op
portunity to be afforded through the
blank system to place themselves on
tecord, while persons who have been
invited to become investors will be
able to learn whether the company
that desires their capital has assumed
the proper attitude. Every investor
Will know what the States questions
are, and if any are unanswered it will
be possible for the investor to get
information why the needed answers
are withheld.
Wyoming has a law that makes it
the duty of the State Geologist to re
port upon the physical condition of
uny mining property upon request, on
the payment of a fee of $26. Fifty
four such examinations were made in
1904. "Publicity," saiys the World,
"is the best protection against swin
dles. When this publicity is made a
matter of record the interested par
ties have reliable data upon which to
base their action."
Another scheme for the protection
of the investor in mines has been pro
posed in Colorado, which is summed
up as follows:
It is proposed to have the State examine
raining corporations ac banks are examined.
The promoters of the plan urge that the State
bureau of mines is responsible only for the
physical condition of the property and that it
has nothing to do with the financial status
of the operating companies. It is urged also
that there is no authority to whom a prospec
tive investor may go to ascertain the value of
any stock or the condition of the financial af
fairs of any mining: company. The inspector or
examiner, according to the Ideas of the men
back of this new legislation, "shall be ac
cessible to visiting investors so far as advice
is concerned, and shall further have power to
satisfy himself as to the status of any mining
corporation by personal inspection of its books.
He shall also be empowered, if satisfied that
any company is insolvent, to prevent its re
ceiving any money in exchange for stock."
VALUES IV DREDGIVG.
The charm of the modern method of
gold dredging for gold is the element
of certainty with which it may be de
termined, before dredging is actually
begun, what rate of gold yield may be
confidently looked for in any given
tract. Frank W. Griffin has written
an article on gold dredging in which
he holds that the value of a property
can be ascertained to a practical cer
tainty before any money is spent for
work other than prospecting, whether
the property is paying.
Mr. Griffin says that one hole to ten
acres is considered to De close pros
pecting. Nevertheless, if ten holes are
sunk on a 100-acre tract, and the total
value of the discoveries in ten holes
be divided by ten, this result is taken
as an average value of the property.
In actual operations this is misleading
to some extent for the reason that in
practice the dredge will produce but
60 to 70 per cent of the drill values as
shown by drill prospecting on this
basis. This does not imply that the
dredge will save but 70 pÂ«r cent of the
gold, but it means that the average
value obtained from computing pros
pecting values is erroneous by about
30 per cent.
The United States Geological Sur
vey published a report by C. W. Pur
ington concerning the difficulties at
tending mining by reason of lack of
good roads in Alaska. The gold that
has been produced in tne interior of
Alaska has been brought out under
great difficulties. Travel is not easy
during even the summer months.
During other seasons transportation is
very difficult. Purington says that the
conditions regarding roads in Alaska
are in sharp contrast with the facts re
lating to the Canadian Yukon. The
Canadian Government has constructed
good wagon roads in the Yukon and
hp.s helped the prospector and settler
hi various ways. It is estimated by
Alfred H. Brooks, also of the United
States Geological Survey, that an ap
propriation of $1,000,000 would build
900 miles of road in Alaska and would
thereby greatly aid In the develop
ment of the territory.
Recent changes in China include the
passing of the control of mines and
railroads from the bureau of mines
and railroads to the board of com
merce. By this department some rules
and regulations have been promul
gated. The general purpose of these
is that Chinese capital must predomi
nate in all development enterprises.
At least 50 per cent of the capital,
where foreign assistance is sought,
must be Chinese money. Foreign com
panies are not permitted to hold more
than 70 per cent of their own capital,
the remainder being reserved for the
Chinese. Mortgages cannot exceed 30
per cent of the original cost of the
erection of a mining plant. The mort
gage can be made to cover only the
machinery and buildings and no lien
can be given on the land. The ex
treme area for which a mining license
can be issued is ten square miles.

cessful and pleasant events in the his
tory of the club.
Chief D. D. McCrae presided and
welcomed the ladies in a few appro
priate remarks. Then followed a pro

McNair and James R. Watson; selec
tion on the bagpipes by Pipers Neil
Lindsay, L. S. R. Tevendale, John
Bennett and Adam Ross; remarks on
"The LaÂ«ies" by First Chieftain D. J.
McFarland; highland reel by lads and
lassies, and a. recitation by Alexander
Smith. Dancing followed, to the music
of Fairgrieve's orchestra.
The lower hall was reserved for re
freshments for the ladles, and In the
ante-room there were stronger re
freshments for the sterner sex. Much
credit for the marked success of the
event is due to the members of the
literary committee, composed of D. J.

MISS CROCKER'S
FORTUNE READY
Heiress Attains Majority
and Her Guardians File
Final Account of Trust
BIG ITEMS OF EXPENSE
Cost of Repairing Private
Car a Feature of Bills
Charged to Young Lady
Miss Jennie Adeline Crocker attained
her eighteenth year yesterday and is
now the mistress of her own millions,
or will be as soon as certain legal
formalities are complied with. Inde
pendently of her probable celebration of
the event, her guardians, Henry T.
Scott and Charles E. Green, observed
the anniversary by filing their four
teenth and final account of their guar
dianship, not only of Miss Crocker, but
of her brother, Charles Templeton
Crocker, who will reach his majority
within a few months.
Doubtless application will be made
immediately to Judge Coffey to relieve
the guardians of their trust and turn
the property over to the opulent young
woman. It has been variously estimat
ed that she will receive between $7,
000,000 and $9,000,000 worth of realty
and dividend-paying securities. Seven
years ago her third interest in her
father's estate was appraised at $2,
500,000 and two years later Mrs. Bur
ton Harrison, her sister, received about
$4,000,000 as her share. Property values
have grown since then, new realty has
been added to the estate, and funds
have accumulated, hence the size of the
fortune of the youngest of Charles F.
Crocker's children.
There is an interesting story in the
figures submitted by the guardians â
one showing that big receipts are
drawn upon by big expenditures in the
care of minor heirs. On August 31 last,
the cash to Miss Crocker's credit was
$459,089 85. .Since then her half of the
irlcome of the estate amounted to
$73,361 43. There were expenditures
that brought the total on hand down
to $413,822, but this included a payment
of $132,000 for a half interest in new
property and $50,000 paid on a mort

that Mr. J. Smart and Miss Jolly are
now strangers. Unfortunately for Mr.
Smart he struck Mr. Jolly on the head
with a pUlow which was intended for
Miss Jolly's younger brother. The old
gentleman was naturally incensed and
ordered young Smart from the prem

the affair will be patched up. and if

Cantata Is Well Sung.
The Young People's Society of St.

chorus was especially effective and
rang out with telling effect in the
concerted numbers. The opening
number was a piano solo by John

"DAVID HARUM"
AT CALIFORNIA
TO -MORROW
W. H. TURNER. WHO WILL PRE
SENT THE CHARACTER OF
DAVID HARUM.
Turner to Plau
Westcott's
Hero.
Local play-goers are centering con
siderable interest in the coming ap
pearance of the popular comedian,
William H. Turner, at the California
Theater on Sunday nig Tit in his in
imitable portrayal of "David Harum."
Turner Is the original successor to
William H. Crane as the famous old
'â hc-ss trading" banker and is now in
his third successful season in the role.
He is still surrounded by most of his
original company, including Walter
Pratt Lewis as the deacon.
Turner has made a deep study of
Harum and to this is probably due his
great success, for he comes as near to
being the ideal David as Westcott, the
author of the story, could have desired.
STREETCAR HITS BUMPER
AND SEVERAL ARE HURT
Passengers Receive a Severe Shaking
Up, but Suffer Only Slight
Injuries.
Several persons were slightly in
jured yesterday forenoon by the col- :
lision of a Polk-street cable car with
thp "bumper" at the Polk and Cali
fornia streets crossing. The car struck
with considerable fÂ«rce and gave the
dozen passengers that were north
bound a quick jar. Every pane of
glass in the car was broken and traffic
on the Polk and California street lines
was delayed for several hours.
H. F. Mann, who lives at 1650 Polk
street, was thrown over the front
dashboard of the car and struck on
his head upon the dummy. His head
was cut. E. Tarrant of 5720 Califor
nia street, who was seated on the
dummy, was thrown with force to the
street, escaping with a few bruises.
W. O. Miles of 68 Portola street re
ceived injuries to his right hand,
which necessitated treatment at the
Emergency Hospital.
LARGER HOUSE FOR
THE UNIVERSITY CLUB
Sutter-Street Quarters of Organization
to Be Replaced by Substan
tial Structure.
The University Club is to have a
fine new club building on the site of
the present structure at 722 Sutter
street. The present club building will
be torn down to make room for the
more modern structure. This was the
derision of the board of directors of
the club at its meeting last evening.
Plans and estimates for the new
clubhouse will be submitted by Bliss
&. Faville, architects, and work of
demolition and rebuilding will begin
at a near date, or just as soon as the
architects are ready with their speci
fications.
The present University Club house
was originally a large family resi
dence. From time to time additions
have been made to it and very cozy
club quarters was the result. The
club has outgrown the clubhouse and
an enlarged home has been in con
templation for several months. The
new clubhouse will be something simi
lar to the present one, but will be
larger and much more substantial.
CHADWICK MUST
BE SENTENCED
Judge Cook Says He Is Get
ting Tired of Having the
Cases on Court Calendar
GRANTS A DATS DELAY
Is Waiting Punishment for
Perjury, Also for Trial
on the Charge of Forgery
Ernest Moore Chadwick'3 pleasant
and profitable sojourn in the County
Jail is drawing to a close. He has been
there for about three years and a half
and has made it his business, it is said,
to coach defendants waiting trial and
to earn money by prescribing for pris
oners who were sick.
Chadwick was tried before a jury in
Judge Cook's court in June, 1901, for
sending by telegraph a forged message
purporting to be from another person.
That was the time he eloped with No
rinne Schneider from Vallejo Junction.
The jury disagreed, and in the follow
ing September he was tried before a
jury in Judge Lawlor's court and con
victed. On October 5 he was sen
tenced to serve ten years in San Quen
tin, but an appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court.
Meantime he was indicted for perjury
committed at his trial, and on July
29, 1902, he was convicted of that of
fense in Judge Cook's court. Sentence
was deferred till the result of the ap
peal to the Supreme Court on the for
gery charge was ascertained. It was
felt that if the Supreme Court should
decide that the information was defec
tive it would be doubtful whether the
perjury charge would hold.
On May 31, 1904, the Supreme Court
made an order granting Chadwick a
new trial, and since then both cases
have been on Judge Cook's calendar,
the one to be set and the other for sen
tence.
Yesterday when the cases were called
Judge Cook said he was getting tired
of continuing them and he wanted
them disposed of. The continuances
had chiefly been granted at the re
quest of Frank J. Murphy, the defend
ant's attorney, because he happened
to be engaged on other cases.
Defective Rope Causes Accident.
J. F. Conway and William Walleson
were injured yesterday afternoon
while attempting to hoist a case of
merchandise from the sidewalk to the
second story of the store of O'Connor,
Moffatt & Co. on Post street. The
case weighed about a ton and had
with difficulty been raised to the
height of thirty feet by means of
block and tackle when the rope broke.
In its descent the case struck both
Walleson and Conway. Conway was
hurt about the head. Walleson's left
toot was injured by a piece of board
broken from the case. Both men were
treated at the Central Emergency
Hospital.

the latter has been Increased in
strength and works together more har
moniously than in the opening games.
The Albion Hovers, on the other hand,

the tournament between teams repre
senting; the San Francisco Golf and
try Club and the Claremont Coun
try Ciub -vvill be played this afternoon
on the course of the latter club in
ridge Park. The first couple will
diive off at 2 o'clock.
As C. E. Maud is not playing in the
San Francisco team, R. Gilman Brown i
hap been included. Otherwise the team \
i^ made up of the same players, though '
F"me slight changes have been made
in their order. John Lawson will play
apainst K. R. Folger and W. P. John-
Bon against H. C. Golcher, as on Sat
urday the 11th inst.. but all the other
players will be paired differently. R.
M. Fitzgerald, who was No. 5, Is at
the bottom of the Claremont team,
and Dr. A. M. Carpenter goes from
sixth to ninth place; G. E. de Golia,
C. Curtis, F. S. Stratton and J. O.
Carlman moving up one or more places.
The first four men in the Claremont
team retain the same order and the
twelve is made up of the same players |
as on the first day of play. The team I
and the order of the players are shown

substitutes of the San Francisco Golf
and Country Club.
On the first eighteen holes of the ;
match which were played on the Pre
f-idio links, the Claremont men ob
tained a lead of seven points. Unless
the San Francisco players can over
come this lead in to-day's play the
match will be credited to the '
Claremont Country Club. A second (
home-and-home match over thirty-six
hoies will be played in April. The scor
ing will be by points and not by holes.
The hole that wins the match will
count one point, each successive hole
to the good counting half a point. This
system diminishes the advantage of
a crushing lead that might be gained
by a member of one team over a mem
ber of the other.

in this city on Monday evening. On
the same evening the members of the
Alameda Cricket Club will hold their
annual dinner and meeting at Croll's
Hotel, Alameda. At both meetings
officers, committees and delegates to
the California Cricket Association will
be elected. The annual meeting and
election of officers of the California
Cricket Association will take place in
this city on Monday evening, March 6.
The Aiameda, Pacific and San Fran
cisco county clubs will probably be
joined this season by a fourth city
club, formed by the Independent Asso
ciation footballers, who desire to keep
together during the summer. The
Santa Cruz Cricket and Athletic Club
and the Sacramento Cricket Club will
retain their membership in the Cali
fornia Cricket Association, but it is
doubtful whether the Burns VaJley
Club will continue to be a member.
The original settlers in Burns Valley
have been greatly thinned out by death
and removal and the remainder are
growing a little too old for the game.
For two or three seasons past the
Burns Valley cricketers have had no
antagonists, the interest of Lakeport
men in cricket having died out. It has
been hard, too, to make up a team of
city cricketers to visit Burns Valley, as
a visit to Lake County requires three
days, two of which are spent in travel
ing, much of it in a stage over rough
and dusty roads. The cessation of
meetings between the players of San
Francisco and those of Lake County is
greatly regretted, as the hospitality of
the Britishers to their visitors was un
bounded.
At various times several country
clubs have belonged to the California
Cricket Association. In 1895 the Brit
ish C. C. of Bakersfield and the Citrus
Colony C. C. of Penryn, Placer County,
were members. In 1897 San Jose and
Lakeport cricket clubs joined, the
Penryn men, coming in under the name
of the Placer County C. C. In 1898
two of the country clubs and two of
the city clubs dropped out, leaving only
three members of the association. In
1899 two Lake County clubs (Burns
Valley and Lakeport) came in and the
British employes of the big copper
mine in Shasta County Joined under
the name of the Mountain Copper Com
pany C. C. In 1900 the Sacramento and
Santa Cruz clubs appear for the first
time among the members of the asso
ciation.
The California Cricket Association
has remained without a head since the
death of Edward Brown, the best sup
porter the game has ever had in this
State. It will be the duty of the dele
pates from the clubs at the annual
meeting to elect a successor to the late
president. For several years Mr.
Brown presented a handsome silk pen
nant to the club which won the highest
percentage of matches during the sea
son. Last year he gave a silver cup
as the championship trophy.
Baird in Trouble Again.
David I. Baird. scion of the wealthy
Baird family, got into a mixup at
Tom's Cabin, Fell and Stanyan streets,
last night and was hit on the h^ad
with a bottle. He accused the bar
tender of striking him. but the lat
ter denies the charge. Baird ams
taken into custody in company with
John Floyd, a colored chauffeur, who
was with him at the time of the trou
ble. Both men spent the night in the
City Prison.
SCHUSSLER STILL ON THE STAND. â The
cross-examination of Hermann Schussler, chief
engineer of the Spring Valley Water Works,
was resumed yesterday before United States
Commissioner Heacock. An evening eeeslon
was held in the office of M. B. Kellogg-. The
testimony related solely to values.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1905.
STANFORD NINE
IS IMPROVING
IN ITS HITTING
Coach Cowden Has
Worked Wonders
With the Mate
rial at His Hand
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 24.
The recent warm weather has done
wonders for the Stanford baseball team
and the men are furnishing an exhi
bition of snap and ginger that has
brought delight to the heart of the
coach and much praise from the
bleachers. Coach Cowden had a squad
of men at the beginning of the sea
son, only four of whom were veterans
and these were the remnants of a los
ing team. With these players and
some new material the freshman class
brought to college the head coach has
already developed a nine that is su
perior to the team of last year at this
time of the season. There was some
luck to this, for two of these fresh
men are players of remarkable abil
ity. The first is Fenton, a fair haired
youngster from Portland. He is cov
ering third base in good style and is
hitting well. In Wednesday's game
he found Lanagan, Stanford's old
varsity pitcher, for two two-baggers.
The other is Cadwalaaer, from Po
mona. He is in center field and seems
to be both a sticker anu a fielder of
merit.
The Cardinal will have four pitchers
this year, Sales, Thiele, Menardi and
Johnson. Of these Sales is the veteran.
This year he has better control and
far more speed than he did in the in
tercollegiate series last season. He
is a big man and can stand lots of
hard work. Thiele is a freshman who
has considerable yet to learn, but he
gives promise of becoming a first-class
twirler before his college career closes.
What he lacks is control and an in
tricate knowledge of the game. He is
larger than Sales and will have all the
speed of the former. Menardi and
Johnson have not had much chance yet
to show Just what they were able to
do, but they are both being used on the
second team.
The fight for the positions on the
team has dwindled down to a few men.
Stott and Daily are both trying for
catcher's position, with Stott in the
lead. Presley seems to be annexed to
first base and the struggle now is for
second between Bell, a freshman
from Holtt's School, and Colbert, first
baseman on last year's varsity. Cap
tain Trowbridge will piay short again.
Freshman Fenton is a fixture at third.
In left field Chalmers, a veteran of
last year's nine, is both hitting and
fielding well and his position is safe
for him. Freshman Cadwalader is in
center and Dudley, an old second team
PASSES BOGUS CHECKS
ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE
Police Are Searching for Hennas J.
Franche, Who Paid City a Fly

The police are searching for Hen

felony charge of passing a fictitious

from two persons and it is said that
there are others. A warrant was
sworn out for his arrest in Police

Franche came here last month and
called upon George J. Lynch, hack

man, has the lead in the fight for right.
Batting is the head coach's watch
word and he practices the men in hit
ting for an hour every afternoon.
Then follows a regular game with the
second team. Three games a week
with visiting teams keep the varsity
busy. As a result of these practice
games the hitting of the team has im
proved wonderfully. With the revival
of the slugging powers has come con
fidence and it is this that has brought
about the recent gingery feeling of the
players.
There has been little doing on the
track this week because of the soft
ness of the cinder path. Miller ran a
fast mile for this time of the year and
the hurdlers have done some good
work. The sprints and the quarter are
still the weakest points and "Dad"
Moulton is making frantic efforts to
develop some fast men in these dis
tances.
ATHLETICS AT BERKELEY.
Blue and Gold Men Active In the Va-
rious Shorts.
BERKELEY, Feb. 24.â The securing
of a professional coach from Harvard
to drill the boating crew in its work
preliminary to the contest with Stan
ford on April 15, is a departure in
University of California atheltics that
has aroused more interest than any re
cent event in college. E. M. Garnett.
the man chosen, is said to be an ex
pert in his line. His coming is expected
to aid in reviving interest in a branch
of sport that has not attracted a large
following at the university in the past.
Concerning the action of the student
body's executive committee, in arrang
ing for Garnett's services. J. P. Loeb,
editor of the Daily Californian. who
was coxswain of the varsity crew last
yeaT, says In an editorial:
At last rowing: has go far forced Itself Into
friend Wand to indorse it. It was
paid into the Nevada National Bank
and returned as worthless. Wand as
indorser had to pay the money to the
bank.
Franche lived in a lodging-honse at
6 O'Farrell street, kept by Mrs. Eliza
beth Metschulate. On February 11 he
got her to giy c him $200 on two
checks, aggregating $235. drawn on the
same company in Kansas City, and
both checks were returned as worth
less. Franche left the lodging-house
on that day and all trace of him has
been lost since. Detective Whitaker
has charge of the case. Descriptions
of Franche, who was also known as
W. R. Moore and Charles E. Morgan,
have been sent out by the police and
asking that he be arrested.

favor that the Associated Students will en
gage a coach for the crew and we may expect
intercollegiate rowing to take another long
forward stride before the end of the season.
California oarsmen have always been ham
pered by lack of proper instruction, which
made development of good form Impossible.
Last year Hindt of Wisconsin offered his ser
vices gratis and coached class and varsity
craws purely for love of the sport. Under him
the men made great improvement, but under
the circumstances he was able to give only a
limited time to coaching. Now that a coach
has been engaged to devote a part of each
day to the 1 crews this year's varsity ought to
b'_> the fastest crew on the coast. With a new
and up-to-date shell and a good coach the
boating men of the university are in a better
position than ever before. A large squad of
freshmen is training for their class crew and
ei-thuslastic upperclassmen are trying for the
varsity four. If we keep up our enthusiasm
rowing will soon be given the recognition it
deserves, and the;, timely action of the ex
ecutive committee will do much to keep that
enthusiasm stirred up.
The new racing shell, which was in
jured in transit from Cornell Univer
sity to Oakland, has not yet been re
paired, and the candidates for places
on the crew are compelled to practice
in barges, as of old,
Thus far this season, In the practice
games that have been played by the
varsity baseball team, but one victory
has been won, that being In the game
with the Independents, a team of
picked professionals, against whom
"Heinle" Heitmuller pitched a phe
nomenally clever game last Saturday.
The varsity met defeat again last
Tuesday when the Claybrough-Golcher
men defeated them by a score of
5 to 1.
The freshmen baseball team is trying
to get a match with Belmont. which, if
arranged, will be played during the
next few days.
The first competitive track work
with athletes outside the university
will be done on March 1. when the
freshmen of the university are to meet
the team of track and field men from
Berkeley High School on the campus

tryout for both teams.
Tryouts for the intercollegiate rifle
team will begin at the rifle range at

SAVINGS SOCIETY BORROWED
MONEY UPON ITS PLEDGES
Ceiyplaint in Intervention Filed in
State's Suit to End Business
of Concern.
That the Pacific Coast Savings So
ciety borrowed money upon the
pledges it had secured for loans made
to its clients is indicated in a com
plaint in intervention filed yesterday
by the firm of Daniel Meyer in the suit
brought by Attorney General Webb to
restrain the society from doing any
more business. Meyer's firm alleges
that between August 27, 1901, and Oc
tober 12, 1903, it loaned the society
$25,000 and took certain pledges as
security.
These pledges, if foreclosed, it is
said, will not pay the amount of the
loans by the society and Meyer, for
which they are double security.
Among the heavier notes, secured by
realty, and some of them flanked by
certificates in the society, are: Mary

Brandon Gup.
Out at Union Coursing Park this
afternoon the first of this season's
greyhounds will appear in the Belle
Brandon cup stake. / Whether there is
a For Freedom or an Emm Pasha

what trials they have been given were
all in private, so there is no positive
knowledge as to their class.
The first of the Roman Athlete pup
pies will be seen in action. The dam
of the three which will start is the
great English greyhound, Fiery Face,

SEVENTEEN TO COMPETE
San Francisco Cracks Win
Everything in Sight in
Alameda County Contest
The good weather has enabled the
tennis players to catch up with therr
schedules and for this reason there
will be but little doing on the courts
to-day and to-morrow. The only tour
nament on the tapis is a ladies' handi
cap singles event, which will be played
on the park courts to-day. This tour
nament is for the Cochran Cup, which
is in the possession of Miss Lulu Weg
ener, the club champion. Miss Weg
ener played from "15 2-6" back >f
scratch in the last tournament. To
day she will be -2-6" farther back, and
as most of the other players have had
their handicaps increased it is expect
ed a new winner will develop.
Seventeen of the club's strongest
players will be in the competition,
which will begin promptly at Â» o'clock
this morning. All matches will be two
sets out of three.
The Golden Gate Club has an unfin
ished tournament to dispose of, but it
will probably be put over until a week
from to-morrow. Two of the four re
maining players will compete in the
Alameda tournament to-morrow. Tht-y
are George Baker and A. Brabant. The
event across the bay will not consume
more than one day and the park play
ers will surely play their three remain
ing matches on March 5.
In the Alameda County champion
ship tournaments on Wednesday the
San Francisco players won everything
in sight. Particularly was this so
with the park contingent. Of the six
players left in the singles four are from
the park, one from the California Club
and one from across the bay. In the
doubles Long and Janes have w<_ i
of the four semi-final places. The
other three places are open to a num
ber of teams.
A. Brabant caused quite a surprise
by beating both the Long brothers. H
first beat Melville Long easily ami then
in two long close sets disposed of Her
bert Long. Brabant is an aggressive
player and his tournament game is
fully up to his practice game. HLs
weak spot is his back hand. In the
singles he first meets Charles I
The latter is playing great tennis and
ought to dispose of the Australian
champion, though not without a strug
gle.
Fred Adams upset calculations when
he beat Charles Dunlap. The latter is
one of the strongest players at the
park while Adams has never been con
sidered a first-class man. He beat
Dunlap decisively, the score being one
sided. Adams will meet the winner of
the Griffin-Noble match.
Carl Gardner looks to have an ex
cellent chance to meet Baker for the
championship. He defeated George
Janes in straight 3ets and played a
consistent game throughout the day.
The doubles championship undoubt
edly lies between the Baker brother?.
Long and Janes and Gardner and
Long. The Bakers are considered to
have almost a sure thing, but they will
have to play their best to beat Long
and Janes.
There will be no tournament on the
California Club courts to-morrow.
Many continuous tournament and
practice matches will be played.
The first tournament of any impor
tance in March will be the mixed dou
bles event, in which the Ladies' An
nex and the Junior Club will partici
pate. The boys will join forces with
the young ladies and an Interesting
tournament should result. Two hand
some silver loving cups have been of
fered for the event, which is scheduled
for next Saturday.
The qualifying rounds of the Indoor
tournaments will be played early in
March. The semi-finals and finals will
be played at the pavilion in April.
The tournaments down to the semi
finals will be played on the park and
California Club courts. There will be
a singles and doubles tourney, one to
be played at each place.
TITUS MAY ROW HERE
AGAINST ALEX W. PAPE
Pacific Coast Association of Amateur
Oarsmen Hopes to Arrange a
Shell Race.
The Pacific Coast Association of
Amateur Oarsmen Is endeavoring to
arrange a match race in shells be
tween the well known scullers, George
Titus of New York and Alex Pape. A
communication has been sent to the
manager of Titus in the East and a
reply stating the terms and conditions
upon which Titus will race is awaited.
If the race is arranged it will take
place on the El Campo course.
In addition to the big event barge
and outrigged skiff racas will be held
for the members of clubs in the as
sociation. It is hoped this interesting
event can be arranged, for rowing on
San Francisco Bay has been rather
dull for some time and something is
needed to give it a fillip and to stir
up public interest.
The Dolphin Swimming and Boat-
Ing Club frequently adds some im
provement to its quarters. It has been
decided to build a solarium, either on
the roof or in the rear of the boat
house, and plans for this desirable ad
junct are now being prepared. A
"cheeping" or clam bake will soon be
held on the beach; also another cross
country run of the members. The
course will be from Tiburon to Es
calle, where a dinner will be served to
the runners and to any members who
may come over from this "ity to join
them.
Barge races for the members are
being arranged, the entry lists being
already open. Four or more strokes
will be selected from those who enter
and these will choose their crews by
lot, the stroke who gets first choice
on one round geting last choice in the
second round, and so on, the object
being to make up as nearly equal in
strength as possible. The winning
crew will receive prizes presented byÂ»
the club.

Three Long Shots
Surprise the
Students.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Roman Gold, a brown filly owned by
W. 08. Macdonouph and trained by
Bto Timmona. displayed a dazzling
turn of speed in the two-year-old dash
at Oakland yesterday, which entitles
her to more than passing attention.
She had been so highly touted since
her first public appearance that the
books took no chances, 6 to 5 being the
first quotation. Ridden by "Big Bill"
Knapp, the brown mlse Jumped away
from her field at the start, and stepped
off the four furlonga Just buck-jump
ing In :48^4 over a track not lightning
fast. F. w. Barr, the second chice, lost
the place to Ramona, an outsider.
Three healthy priced horses and
three public choices annexed purses.
Mountebank at 15, and Whoa Bill, a 10
to 1 shot, furnished the surprises.
WRIGHTS LEISURELY RIDE.
Wright, on My Order, the 7 to 5 fa
vorite, tossed off the Futurity course
sprint, second to be decided. Charley
Murray's apprentice took matters easily
from the head of the stretch, suffering
from the delusion that he could tap
I'onner. astride Mogregor, whenever
the occasion required. But Bonner, like
Battling Nelson, is a hard one to down,
and he simply put It all over Wright,
landing the 6 to 1 shot first by a neck..
It was a race thrown away. Alone fin
ished third.
_ Billy Cahill grabbed a purse first rat
tle out of the box with his recent pur
chase, Andrew Mack. KnaDp had the
xnount on Andrew, which the books
installed favorite. He was by long
odds the best, for, after getting -badly
buffeted about at the first turn, Knapp
had his mount in the lead entering the
etretch, and breezed in first. Follow
Me disposed of Flaunt for the place.
P. Ryan's black horse San Nicholas
â¢cored a farcical win of the mile and
a furlong selling fixture. The book
makers seemed bound to give away
something and laid 11 to 10 almost
throughout the betting. The price
looked a long one and, with Jakie
Jones in the saddle, the Ryan entry
led from start to finish. Divina, the
second choice, led Barrack out ten
lengths for the place.
MOUNTEBANK A WINNER.
How Anvil beat Mountebank eight
lengths on the 18th insL is too dim
cult of solution. Forgetting that weird
seance. Mountebank receded from 8 to
15 to 1 in the betting on \he six and
a half furlong run yesterday. Jones
again rode the gelding and he gave the
hot foot to a clever field, running
home more than a length ahead of
The Volt and Matt Hogan.. The latter
had first call in the betting. ."T
Whoa Bill, piloted by Alarie and 9
and 10 to 1. took the concluding six
furlong sprint from Gallopoff in a
driving finish. Rector, the 11 to 10
choice, did not appear in the best con
dition and, after cutting out roost of
the pace, ran a close third. Whoa
BUI displayed a decided improvement
in his form, Alarie bringing him up
from last position and winning by a
length. Gailopoff. the Derby candidate
from the Daly stable, had his odds
sliced from 20 down to 10, and if a
quicker beginner he might have won.
TKA< X NOTES. ' 'Â£?<?/â 
Roman Gold and Sir Wilfred will run
gome when they meet. The former filly
looks like the best of the season's out
put.
"Big Bill" Knapp and Jakie Jones
each piloted two winners.
Tommy Clark, who was suspended
for an indifferent ride some weeks ago,
has been restored to good standing by
the stewards.

The Volt that. he bet $1000 on the

If Knapp had kept Sol Lichtenstein

EXHIBIT OF CHILDREN'S PETS
IN GAME ASSOCIATION SHOW
Young Students of Nature Will Have
a Section Set Apart for
Themselves.
The children's pets exhibit, which will
be one of the numerous adjuncts of the
Forest, Fish and Game Association ex
hibition to be held in Mechanics' , Pa
vilion during the first two weeks in
April, is attracting great attention
from the little oner, and will form a
clever side issue to the general scheme.
Children under 10 years of age are in
vited to become exhibitors. In a sec
tion sot apart for them will be found
a varied collection of plants, birds and
animals, which must be tha property
of the children. One little tot has trans
formed the remains of an old street
lump into an aquarium, and will show
his finny treasures in this strange
glass house. Another has entered a
parrot; still others some plants they
have reared from the seed.
Dr. F. W. d'fivelyn is honorary chair
man of the committee, and the scheme 1
is a hobby of his because he believes it
will be a great educator for the chil
dren.
Theodore Kytka wrote the associa
tion yesterday that he had contracted
for a band of some thirty Shoshone In
dians to move their village to the banks
of the lake that will adorn the cen
ter of the pavilion. They will not give
any performance, but t*uir engagement
shows the world of detail which is be
ing covered to make the exhibition at
tractive and to lend color to the In
door forest effect.
It being necessary to keep the auto
mobile trade exhibit on the main floor,
George T. Marsh has advanced a
unique plan to get away from the stilt
ed line of vehicles and keep up the out
door idea. A panoramic view of Cali
fornia hills will be painted for the side
wall, and, with the aid of trees, mow
and shrubbery, a country road will be
produced. In this road will be found
the different manufactures of ma
chiries, and the road win wind in a
manner to separate each exhibit from
the other
BOXERS WORK
LIKE TROJANS
Corbett and Nelson Are Put
ting Forth Unusual Ef
forts in Their Training
WEIGHT IS A PROBLEM
Despite the Most Favorable
Conditions It Comes Off
Both of the Men Slowly
Young Corbett and Battling Nelson
are working like Trojans at their re
spective training camps in Marln
County for their battle, which takes
place at Woodward's Pavilion on the
28th inst.
Neither boxer has left a stone un
turned during the long siege of train
ing and both seem in the pink of con
dition. Neither has as yet tipped the
beam at 130 pounds, the weight they
are required to make at 6 p. m. on the
night of the battle, but Doth are con
sidered within striking distance and
they expect to have no serious trouble
reaching the required mark.
As usual a large delegation of sport
ing men visited Shannon's villa yes
terday to watch Corbett box with Gans
[ and to get a line on the little Denver-
I ite's conditon.
Corbett is immensely popular with
j the sporting fraternity an~ standing
I room in the gymnasium was at a
I premium. In the afternoon Corbett
spent more than an hour in the gym
nasium and worked like a Trojan.
He started his work by punching the
bag, but a fierce right swing knocked
the leather ball from the platform tcr
the other side of the room. He then
tackled the huge oakum bag which Al
Herford imported from Baltimore for
his benefit. The bag on former occa- i
Bions has been used by Gans and it is j
a wonder to bring the perspiration. It
weighs more than a hundred pounds
and is five feet in height. Five min
utes' steady punching was allotted to
j Corbett and he was ready to quit when
the time expired.
The jumping rope was then brought
into use and Corbett Jumped exactly |
a thousand times. After doing his
other various stunts he donned the
mitts with Gans and four rounds of
furious boxing was indulged in.
The spectators were immensely
pleased and for a minute they thought
they were viewing a real battle. A
dusky friend of Gans' became greatly
excited and yelled "Soak him, Joe."
After a rubdown Corbett weighed
133% pounds.
Al Herford stripped to the waist
and helped Trainer McDonald rub his
protege.
In the morning the usual run of ten |
i miles over the hills was indulged in by
Corbett.
Battling Nelson spent a busy day at
hiÃ training camp at Metzner's Tavern,
â  Larkspur. The "big Dane," as usual,
! arose with the birds and took a long
tramp through Baltimore Canyon be
fore breakfast.
At 10:30 a. m., Bat, accompanied by
Manager Billy Nolan. Bill Benner and
Fred Landers, went on the road. The
morning was extremely warm and
Landers and Nolan soon became also
rans. Bat and Benner kept on, but the
latter in a few minutes also blew up.
Bat continued to Sausalito and re
turned with the perspiration rolling
from him.
In the afternoon a large crowd was
on hand to see the Battler go through
: his paces in the gymnasium. He work
ed more than an hour there and his
work convinced the spectators that he
could not be in better condition if he
were made to order.
The bout with Fred Landers was
something tierce and the quickness dis
j played by Nelson surprised his friends.
j Bat is rapidly becoming a finished
I boxer. He seems twice as fast as
when he fought Corbett before.
Nelson's weight was given out by.
Manager Nolan as being 136 pounds
yesterday morning. After his day's
work he weighed 133 pounds. He is ex
pected to weigh 134 V& pounds this
morning. If Nelson's trainers can
count on a net reduction in his weight
of one pound per day they are quite
well satisfied.
STANFORD STUDENTS RATIFY
NEW ATHLETIC AGREEMENT
While They Do Not Object to Profes-
sional Coaches They Retain Lan
ugnn for Three Years.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 24.
The executive committee of the Asso
ciated Students met last night and
ratified the athletic agreement recently
recommended by the graduate boards
of Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia. The main feature of this agree
ment is that the two universities are
no longer limited to the employment
of a graduate coach in football. While
there has been much discussion among
the professors and students here as to
the advisability of changing the rule
and allowing professional coaches to
enter into Pacific Coast college athlet
ics, yet the agreement passed the ex
ecutive committee without a dissenting
vote.
Stanford, however, will retain James
F. Lanagan, a graduate of 1900. to
coach both baseball and football for
the next three years. By this agree
ment the special students of the Af
filiated Colleges of San Francisco are
debarred from participation in inter
collegiate athletics. After this year
there will be a field meet between the
freshmen of the two universities.
The freshman track athletes will
meet the combined forces of the San
Jose, Santa Clara and Palo Alto high
schools to-morrow in a field day on
the Stanford campus. While the fresh
men are expected to win easily, yet
the ev*nts will give the Stanford train
er thff first good opportunity to see
just what strength the entering class
brought to the Cardinal this year. Cope
will be the only youngster not en
tered, an injured ankle still keeping
him out of the sprints.
In the afternoon the varsity base
ball team will line up against Charley
Doyle's team of San Jose professionals.
This aggregation of players defeated
the Cardinal two weeks ago, but Coach
Cowden expects the recent revival of
hitting powers of the varsity will last
long enough to take the visitors into
camp.
The second preliminary tennis tour
nament will be played to-morrow. A
freshman, A. R. McSwain, won the first
tournament a week Â«ago and with the
winner of to-morrow's games will play
a round robin with G. A. Hodge, a
member of last year's varsity team, to
decide the places on this year's varsity
team.

INVADER SHOWS
HIS CLEVERNESS
Thomas Gets Hairline Ver
dict Which Is Roundly
Hissed by the Multitude
POWELL SCORES EASILY
Harry Tenny Takes All Urn
Fight Out of Jimmy,
WTiile Cairns Beats Otts
A boxing product from the Old
World in the person of Jack McLaugh
lin of London bowed to the fight fans
of this city for the first time at Wood
ward's Pavilion last night and, al
though his initial attempt ended in de
feat, he showed he could go enough to
make many of our natives sidestep.
McLaughlin was pitted against the
hard-hitting Joe Thomas. The bout
went the limit of four rounds and most
of the fans thought McLaughlin should
have left the house with the heavier
portion of the Back.
The English boxer is not graced with
any particular sort of style or motion,
but he is there with a snappy sort of
left, which he used wjth deadly effect
in countering. Several times he had
Thomas wondering what was about to
come off next, but the decisive wallop
was never brought over, though both
boys had chances to turn the trick.
The initial round was about even,
with both men boxing cautiously and
doing but little mixing. McLaughlin
commenced to put on steam In the sec
ond spasm, especially when Thomas
came at him with a lead. The British
er sent in those choppy boys with good
effect and Thomas was dazed for a
time. Thomas had the third to his lik
ing and nearly finished the English
lad.
BRITISH BOXER AGGRESSIVE.
McLaughlin made a final stand In
the fourth period and came near get
ting Thomas a couple of times. For
the first time during the bout the Brit
isher assumed the aggressive. A min
ute before the bout ended he sent in
left after left and the crowd pulled for
him. He was still after Thomas when
the bell clanged. Both judges agreed
on Thomas as the winner, though the
spectators were not at all pleased.
Lew Powell was far and away a bet
ter man than Gus Salisbury in the last
event on the programme. Salisbury
barely escaped the knockout penalty.
Powell was the aggressor in every
round save the first and worried Salis
bury by shooting in hard lefts and fol
lowing up the lead with well-placed
rights. Salisbury went to the floor in
the third from a right on the Jaw and
Powell came within an ace of ending
the battle there.
Salisbury started in by jabbing Pow
ell all around the ring in the first
round. The latter was worried, but
came at his man with a rush when the
next period opened and from that time
on there was not a thing to it. Salis
bury could not mix and when Powell
got him in the tight places the former
seemed reaJy to go to the carpet at
any moment.
TENNY FINISHES MURRAY.
Young Dempsey and George San
franson put up the best mill of the
night. It was slug and fight from the
sound of the bell, with both men wav
ing in and fighting for fair. The de
cision was as close as any ever handed
out at an amateur contest. Dempsey
receiving the verdict amid the cheers
and jeers of the assembled hosts.
Bob Cairns brought a couple over on
Nobby Otts' jaw in the second round
of their mix-up and the latter's sec
onds were there with the towel. Otts
never had a chance and Cairns simply
waded in and did the best he could.
Harry Tenny finished Jack Murray
of New York In the fourth round. Mi -
ray's cleverness counted fur naught
when the South Side slugger s?ot under
way and an avalanche of rights and
lefts in the final spasm ended the mix
up.
Pete Sullivan and Joe Ward started
to fight, but Ward quit in a round and
the judges ordered another go. -Tan
glefoot" McGovern and Jim Bradley
went to it and Bradley got the decision.
Al Elkins had little trouble in out
pointing Bob Ritchie in their mix-up.
TERRIFIC EXPLOSION.
The well known inventor, Mr. P. B.

Limited to Two Rounds
PHILADELPHIA. Feb. 14. â Abe
Attell had much the better of a six
round fight with Eddie Hanlon to
night at Industrial Hall before a small
attendance. Attell outpointed Hanlon
at all stages of the bout and at no
tlmÂ«. was he in a tight place. Al
though Hanlon outweighed his oppo
nent, he could do no effective work
except tn the clinches.
Attell was quick on his feÂ«t and was
in and out before Hanlon knew what
he was about. With the exception of
the fourth and fifth rounds. In which
most of the work was done, the flght
was an ordinary affair. Neither man
was punished to any extent.

Cables Sympathy to Bed
side of Sir Henry Irving
WOLVERHAMPTON. Feb. 24.â Sir
Henry Irving's condition to-night is
unchanged from the morning. The pa
tient himself is brave and hopeful. The
attending physician told the press that
Sir Henry was completely run down
and that it was impossible at present
to make any aafe prediction concern
ing the prospects of his reappearance
on the stage. As soon as he is able he
will go to the south coast.
One of his doctors told the Associat
ed Press to-night that Sir Henry's con
dition was the result of overwork at
his age. combined with a continuous
round of entertainment at every place
he has visited during this, his last, pro
vincial tour.
All this, coupled with eight perform
ances each week and continual travel-
Ing, has resulted in a breakdown.
The doctor says he hopes that his pa
tient will be able to leave his bed be
fore the end of next week. At mid
night Sir Henry was resting well.
The messages of sympathy Include
cable dispatches from Joseph Jeffer
son, Richard Mansfield, Sir Charles

Board Dismisses Charges.
The Board of Fire Commissioners
yesterday afternoon dismissed the
charges against Hoseman N. A. Roeb
ling of engine No. 12. Roebling was
accused by Battalion Chief John Wil
lis of being absent from his post and
with neglect of duty. A number of
firemen were reported to be on the
sick list. To some of them full pay
was granted, while the other cases
were taken under advisement.
PENCHI ANGRY
WITH POLACCO
Takes Up Grievance of Wife
and Says Conductor Has
Kept Her From Singing
TIVOLI PEOPLE IN KOW
Tetrazzini Not Involved,
but Berlindi and Others
Take Part in the Feud
AH Is not harmony among the Ital
ian singers at the Tivoli. The same
voices that can warble and trill can
also snap and growl. There Is a deep
| rooted feud, which/ has been growing
j and expanding with the season until
now it is a case of open 'warfare.
On one side are Polacco, the con
1 ductor, and Berlindi, the dramatic so
prano, and on the other Signor Penchi
and his wife, also a dramatic soprano.
j The entire company is rent with the
j dispute, and all, with the exception of
I Tetrazzini, have taken sides. Tet
razzini has held aloof from the qifar-
Hrel and considers it none of her af
fair. .
The trouble centers upon Signora
Penchi. She is a regular member of
the company, with a great reputation
as a fine soprano voice, but not once
.; has she been allowed to appear dur
ing the stay of the company in San
! Francisco. Signora Penchi attributes
â  the snubs she has received to Polacco,
i who, she asserts, desires to advance
! the interests of %rlindl to the detri
j ment of herself. The aggrieved song
stress had appeared with great success
1 in Milan with Caruso and in the City
of Mexico.
When she came to San Francisco
i with the company she was given to
â  understand that she would appear as
heretofore in such operas as "Aida,"
I "II Trovatore" and "L'Africaine." From
; time to time the programme was
changed and idleness enforced upon
Signora PenchL
The public has remarked the absence
cf any of the heavier operas, and the
impression has gone abroad that there
is no voice in the company suited to
the roles. Such, however, is not the
case. Polacco's acts alone, it is as-
I serted, have kept the company from
producing "Aida" and "Carmen."
Signor Penchi has at different times
i asked an explanation of Polacco. First
it was a mere postponement and then,
according to Penchi, Polacco would
trump up some petty excuse.
"It is purely a case erf jealousy," is
the way in which Penchi accounts for
the conduct of Polacco.
At one time Polacco said Signora
Penchi did not have the requisite
boauty; at another time he said her
figure would not do. Signora Penchi,
it may be remarked, is not as stout as
Signorina Ines de Frata or Lina
Benedetto, who achieved great suc
cesses in past seasons in the heavier
roles at the old Tivoli.
Signor Penchi held his wrath from
day to day, believing that in the end
Polacco would give his wife the op
portunity which was hers by right. It
was finally settled last week that
Signora Penchi should appear to-night,
but now at the last moment there is
a sudden change and Signora Penchi
has lost her last opportunity to ap
pear during the present season in San
Francisco.
Signor Penchi has now made it a
personal matter with Polacco. He has
addressed a note to the conductor in
which he states his opinion of the
> leader in no uncertain terms. Signora
Penchi and Berlindi modestly remain
in the background, saying harsh things
about each otheiv but leaving the set
tlement of the issue to their cham
pions.
AWARDS CONTRACT FOR
H STREET IMPROVEMENT
Board of Works Also Accepts Bids for
Repairs to Many Bitumin
ous Pavements.
The Board of Works yesterday
awarded a contract to the City Street !
Improvement Company to pave with [
asphalt the roadway of H street, from !
Seventh to Twentieth avenues, for j
$27,990 10. The Yorke Company, |
which had the original contract for â¢
the work, afterward rescinded owing
to a technicality, protested against the
award of a new contract and will be
gin court proceedings to test the mat
ter when work Is begun.
Contracts were also awarded to the
City Street Improvement Company for
the repair of bituminous pavements
in the district bounded by McAllister,
Waller and Devisadero streets and Van
Ness avenue for $264 9, and the district
bounded by Golden Gate avenue, Post
and Devisadero streets and Van Ness
avenue for $3690. The Barber Asphalt
Company got the contract to repair
asphalt pavements on blocks on Va
lencia, Polk, O'Farrell, Jessie, Steven
son and New Montgomery streets and
Grant avenue for $200. Contracts j
were also awarded for the improve- â ,
ment of Palmer street, between Fair- i
mount and Chenery; Mateo street, be- !
tween Chenery and Laidley; Sixteenth
avenue, between H and I streets, and ;
Parnassus avenue, between Stanyan
and Willard streets.
The Panhandle and Ashbury Heights
Improvement Club petitioned for the j
removal of unsightly poles now being '
erected by the San Francisco Gas
Company on Shrader, Oak, Frederick,
Page and Ashbury streets and Central
avenue, it is alleged, in violation of the
charter. The board decided that it \
had no jurisdiction in the matter and i
referred the petitioners to the Board
of Supervisors for the relief desired.
The Supervisors were requested to j
provide money for the repair of the
elevators in the City Hall and Hall of
Justice, which are in dangerous con
dition. Unless repairs are made at
once the elvators will be closed down.
SEEKS REGULATIONS
FOR UNSIGHTLY POLES
Supervisors' Judiciary Committee Di-
rects Clerk to Secure Data on
Subject From Eastern Cities.
The Supervisors' Judiciary Commit- j
tee yesterday reported in favor of the !
amended ordinance requiring permits !
to be obtained from the Board of |
Works, as well as the Department of \
Electricity, before poles and electric
wires are placed in the streets or side
walks of the city. The clerk was di
rected to procure data from Eastern '
cities as to any regulations in effect i
for the installation of poles, the res- '
idents of Ashland Heights having pe
titioned for the removal of unsightly
poles in the district.
The claim of Warner Temple for
damages caused by the widening of
Mission street between Silver avenue
and Tlngley street was referred to the
Finance Committee.
The petition of William Maguire
that he be paid $100 for the convic
tion of two unlicensed physicians was (
granted, and that of James A. Code
for $25 84 interest on a Judgment was
denied.

A striking feature of the situation is the
abundance of funds seeking aafe Investment
<â  a 4 per cent basis. In 1904 over $450,000,-
Ow new bonds and 9222.000,000 new railroad
*tock s were Issued, a total of over $670,000,000
railroad issue*. Since January 1 over $100.-
OÂ«i0.000 additional railroad issues, chiefly bonds,
hfcve been added. A portion of these Issues
tÂ«-as for refunding purposes, a part for taking
u> notes issued two years ago and a part to
provide for present needs. Just how much
to apportion to each class of needs It is lm
posrible to determine, but a very considerable
portion *-enÂ» to take up notes and to meet
current requirements ana therefore represrnt
*<l new fixed capital. Even this large output
cf new securities does not seem to have satis
fied the public demand, which Is particularly
fortunate for both the railroads and the bank
ers- who have bonds to offer. There is still

ers, however, not always exercising the dis
crimination that they should, end In all prob

roads reporting earnings made a showing 8

cf unfavorable climatic conditions the in

on 178.0^0 miles of road (80 per cent of out

NEW TORK. Feb. 24. â^The atock market
Â»â Â» more settled to-day and there was a re
6umpuon of strength. This was larg.-ly due
to a decrease in th? feanÂ» of a disastrous out
ciiiup Â«o the etruirple for control of the South
ern iron companies. Thrre were less reasons
â¢ â  in th.iefe I their
movements were Ipss excited and convulsive
thÂ»n"tlio*e of yesterday. The group was re
pjirdcd with mere or-. leas suspicion and dis
trust, however, - which was accounted for by
th;-. trmtinuaJ conflict of the various statements
and r?i'9rt put in circulation with a semblance
of Hu:ht>rity. Tb^se were concerned with the
HHHvifij al>sed to I>e made in the accumula
ti->n of controlling holdings In the various
Â«.â¢' mpaniÂ»*s and of the terms said to be agreed
u|Â»on for payment for the stocks. The quota
tion in the market continued widely different
from the alleged terms, and the public at
large was much at a logs to form accurate
conclusions as to the probable final outcome
or the whole aft Air. Activity reverted very
lankly to the rall*-cad list and high grades of
the Htocks most prominent In the trading
h'ijw?<l to reassure sentiment disturbed â  by yes
terday's sensational fluctuations. New Tork
<Vntral cas a leading feature and its advance
of over seven pointe was made on much lancer
tranj-JK-tionÃ than are usual in that stock. The
principal operations were attributed to the
pa me BourcÂ»a as the recent campaign In Onta
rio and W**tern. This led to a revival of a
former rumor that the recently acquired con
trol by the New York. New Haven and Hart
ford of Ontario and Western was to be trans
ferred to or shared by New York Central.
The movement in other Eastern railroad stocks
tcp.f largely sympathetic. Union Pacific recov
ered vigorously from its rather eharp break
of late yesterday to a record price at 136. and
th!Â« woÂ» another cvmpathetlc Influence, of wide i
effect in the market. Illinois Central was the
leader in the Southern group. ' The buying of
the Ftock had no other explanation than pen
eral considerations .of Its relative price level.
" Amalgamated Copper seemed to be helped by
the extra dividend declared yesterday on the
stork of an important Independent copper com
pany. The Wabash system reported net earn-
Ingi-' for January, which showed a falling eff
of considerably over 60 per cent from those of
Jar.ua.ry for the preceding year, but its pre
ferred itfock was not debarred from a share In
the day's strength. The Gould croup was
helped by the very large over- subscription for
the $25,000,000 of Missouri - Pacific bonds,
which were offered to-day. â  Th* subscriptions
rf-ee!ved were reported by the bankers to be
over eight times the amount of bonds. This
evidence, which is corroborative of many oth
er*, of the abundance of capital-se*-kinÂ« InveÂ«r
nwnt marks the real sustaining factor In the
present extraordinary market. The upward
movement snread rapidly toward the. last snd
gained greatly In animation with the outburst
In New York Central and , Union Pacific, j
which carried prices with them to a firm close.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
â 'â 'â  CHICAGO. Feb. 24.â Corn was the leader In
the " grain trade to-day, pulling Âup - prices iof
both wheat and oats. Big exports of corn was
the principal reason | for â¢ the â¢ unusual situation.
May corn at the close showed an advance of
: %Â©lc.'"~'-. Wheat â ', is up %c. Oats made net
gain of Vi@%c. Provieiona are practically un
changed. --â -."-'â  'â .'-':,. * - â "-â  â :'',\^'-'4?-:*-t--*; I ',.:u ''i-if-r'
*-i An â¢â  active demand . from . several * prominent
bulls and good buying by cash houses started
the sharp = advance In : the 'â¢ price of corn.
Alarmed ' at : the ' appearance jof urgent " demand
shorts endeavored to cover; but offerings be
ing extremely small they only served to force
higher 'prices. ' The clearances 'at the seaboard
wab the = factor which received . much . attention.
Owing to lower cables the market opened
easier, . May â " being ;a , shade :,. to ;%@Uc Â» lower
at 46*i(g>40%c. v Almost .Immediately, 1 how
ever, heavy purchases . by a' recognized - leader
of the bulls precipitated an active inquiry
from : shorts â¢ and as the session - advanced ;. the
. volume - " of. : : trading increased. - , Prices " rose
steadily until May had reached. 48c. The mar
ket I closed ' practically at the : highest point,
final quotations .of May being 47% c' 'â : ; . : t

wheat opened easier. May"' was unchanged to
>be higher ; at 91 is V" l 18%. and July was
unchanged -,'. to %c lower ; at , $1 01%@l 01%.
The -weakness ' at Liverpool : was attributed to
enormous : shipments from > Argentina, *i' exports
from. that country being 4,360,000 bushels, com
pared with 3,965,000 bushels in the correspond
ing week a ' year ago. - Pit 'traders -sold -quite
freely, at : times forcing May down- to 91 184.
On the dip commission houses became active
buyers, causing \ a quick rally. 'During ' the
last half-hour the volume of trading was very
light, the Interest of traders â¢ being 'diverted
temporarily to the -corn pit. The strength of j
the â¢ yellow . cereal was the â¢ main cause of ' late |
firmness -â¢ In other grains. At .91 18% May ;
leached the highest point of the day -and the |
closing â  was at the top. ; ; July sold 'â  up â to

, present. ".â  The â â  feeling was * firmer . yesterday, ,

some : activity .-.'. in >.â  December at an ad- !

The feature of the Oriental business at pres- j
I ent ;s, the .canceling of the â¢ shipments to â 
i Vladivostok, which the vessels cannot reach..
! and 1 ; their diversion to Yokohama. The grain
', thus goes out of the country just the same, ,
| whether to Russia or Japan. As mentioned a
i day or two ago. it is expected that â¢ four or |
five vessels will load Barley. Oats. Flour. Pro- '.
I visions, etc., for Japan at this port and Seattle
during | the . next sixty days. ;'. In fact. two. new '
charters 'â â¢ for < this account are : reported else- I
where in this ' issue. A large ; line of Col lisa
Barley is reported sold for Port Costa delivery
at higher prices than those ruling here, which .
shows that, though this local . market may be i

Hay and Feedstnffs.
It was reported yesterday that some of the
Hay shipped on the steamer Olentur^et for
Yokohama has been diverted to Honofulu. The
Hay recently bought for the Orient la being
buffeted about in so many directions that no
body knows where it ia going, or in fact,
whether half of It will finally go at all. It
places the market in a very bad condition.
It was unsatisfactory enough as it was with
out this added complication.

Within forty-eight hours after the;
publication of its first number, for Feb-
ruary,. THE ' PANDEX OF THE
PRESS was the most widely read maga-
zine ever issued on the Pacific Coast. It
took an instant grip upon the popular pa-
tronage. It was pronounced the most
original and useful of all periodicals â
the most indispensable and most fascin-
ating. .;;: < ;
Preliminary demands from the
news stands and from all parts of the
country indicate that the second num-
ber, for ' March, will be sold out within
half the time. The idea of giving the
best material from all the newspapers
of the world has made a "hit"â the
greatest hit, indeed, since the Review
of Reviews was published in England
in 1901.
If you want the March issue* go to
your news dealer at once. He will be
sold out if you wait. "

NO PRECAUTION
AGAINST FIRE
Architect Tharp Makes His
Eeport to Grand Jury on
Conditions in Playhouses
The Grand Jury's desire for drastic
action in regard to the showhouses
that have failed to comply with the
lire ordinance has abated, and instead
of insisting that they shall be closed
summarily, as was done at the begin
ning, the attention of the Board of
Public Works and the Police Commis
sion is to be respectfully called to the
violations of the law that these au
thorities might take the proper steps
to enforce obedience.
The inquisitorial body spent yester
day afternoon in going over the report
by Architect Newton J. Tharp of his
inspection of the various theaters in
the city. Hardly one of them was
found to conform to the regulations or
to be up-to-date in the matter of pro
tection from flames. The architect has
four or five more inspections to make,
and when these reports shall have been
made the Grand Jury will send cop
ies of them to the proprietors of the
amusement places and also to the
municipal boards with pointed sug
gestions that the ordinance is on the
books to be obeyed.
A distinction arises between the the
aters that were built before and those
after the passage of the ordinance. Al
most a!f of the larger show places were
constructed before the stringent mea
sure was made law by the Supervisors
as a result of the awakening of the
horrors of theater fires after the Iro
quois disaster in Chicago.
Architect Tharp picks out the Bel
vedere Music Hall for the following
"general remarks":
"With the exception of one or two
particulars, none of the provisions of
the ordinance have been complied with.
As this building was altered to its
present plan and for its present pur
pose since the passage of the ordi
nance, nothing can be done but recon
struct it entirely to make it comply
with the ordinance."
The Novelty, Unique, Mission-street
and the Baldwin theaters, which are
all of the 10-cent sort, were construct
ed after the ordinance was enacted,
and Tharp points out that they must
be made to comply with it. They are
all mostly of wood construction and
some of them are even without hose
reels or water barrels. La Boheme Mu
sic Hall, of which Supervisor Alpers is
one of the proprietors, needs only a
few improvements to meet approval.
The architect explains that its owners
had given the matter of fire protection
much attention.
Reports were also made on the Co
lumbia, Orpheum, Grand, California,
Alcazar, Fischer's and the Oberon, all
of which were built before the ordi
nance was adopted. Fault is found
with each of them under the present
law.

have engaged Marshall Darrach to

for the benefit of All Saints' Mission.

TIDE CARRIES
BOYS TO SEA
William and Charles Muller
Spend the Night Drifting
About in a Small Boat
PARENTS GROW ANXIOUS
Start for Sausalito to Tow
Home Skiff and Are Absent
for Twenty - Four Hours
An acquaintance with the strength
and eccentricities of the tide is neces
sary for those who would navigate the
waters of this harbor in small boats.
Experienced boatmen and fishermen
use the jiu Jitsu method an* utilize the
strength of their enemy, the tide, to
lighten their labors. William and
Charles Muller, who live at 906 Lom
bard street, possessed only a swimming
acquaintance with the greatest harbor
in the world, and when they under
took to visit Sausalito in a Whitehall
boat they made trouble for themselves
and caused their parents an anxious
night. .
The Muller boys bought a skiff in
Sausalito. They borrowed a Whitehall
boat and Thursday morning at 8
o'clock started in the borrowed boat
from Meigg-s wharf. Intending to row
to Sausalito, get the skiff and tow it
to North Beach. The tide allowed
them to reach Sausalito in fairly good
time. After resting from their toil
with the oars, they started, Thursday
afternoon, to row home. Therp was a
strong ebb tide running and as soon
as the oarsmen cleared the land they
found it out.
Tug and struggle at the oars as they
would they made no headway against
the swift current, which soon had them
speeding seaward. They concluded
that the Whitehall boat was too heavy
for them to row so they transferred
themselves and the oars to the skiff
and tried towing the larger boat.
They ran into a fog bank before
dark and when the fog lifted a little
darkness prevented their plight being
seen by passing vessels. Then the fog
settled down again. They think they
went outside the heads. They believe
they heard the people on the Faral
lones calling the chickens for their
morning meal. Charles is certain he
heard a number of pilots arguing as to
whether a straight flush beat four aces
and William tells of almost colliding
with the lightship.
As the waves washed away their
tracks as fast as the boats slid by,
they will never know just where the
tide carried them. Daylight found
them still traveling. A heavy fog phut
them in and silence reigned on all
sides. They thought they must be
somewhere near Honolulu, when the
blast of a whistle told them they were
unpleasantly near the track of some
ferry boat. Then out came the Cali
fornia sunshine and drove away the
fog.
On Meipgs wharf the parents of the
boys were watching anxiously. All
night long they had waited for the
boys to return. At daybreak they vis
ited the water front, questioning fish
ermen and imploring boatmen to make
a search for the missing youngsters.
"There they are," said Michael Fitz
gerald, the eagle-eyed lookout at
Melggs wharf for the Merchants' Ex
change. In the field of Fitzgerald's
long telescope, what looked to the
naked eye like a tiny dot stood out
sharp and clear as the skiff, the white
hall and the missing Mullers. Still in
the clutches of the tide they were just
off Sausalito. A gasoline . launch was
sent to their assistance, the long voy
age ended in safety, and at the Mul
ler breakfast table the boys told the
story of their adventures with the tide
and of how it tried to run away with
them.

WITTMAN'S
TRIAL IS
PUT OVER
Police Board's Calendar Too
Crowded and Case of Chief,
Accused of Incompetency,
Is Set for Monday Night
HIS ACQUITTAL NOW
BELIEVED PROBABLE
Commissioners Begin Hear
ing on Charges Against
Members of Ellis' Squad for
Corruption in Chinatown
The trial of Chief of Police Wittman
on charges of incompetence and neg
lect of duty was postponed last evening
by the Police Commissioners to Mon
day night. Press of business, cases
that had precedence on the calendar,
occasioned the delay. The attorney for
the Chief pleaded for an early trial and
the board was agreeable to his wishes.
"Are there any objections on your
part to a postponement of the trial of
Chief Wittman?" asked President Po
heim, addressing Congressman Kahn,
Wittman's attorney.
"We are ready to proceed," respond
ed the lawyer, "and desire to begin the
trial at the earliest date possible. We
ask the fullest investigation of these
charges and of everything connected
with the official career of Chief Witt
man. But the Chief is Under suspension,
and as we are ready we ask that there
be no delay. If you cannot go ahead
to-night we ask that the trial be held
to-morrow night, and if not then that
it be set peremptorily for Monday
night."
Monday night was satisfactory to all
the Commissioners.
"We understand, then," spoke up
Kahn, "that the case is set perempto
rily for that time."
"We cannot promise absolutely,"
was Poheim's reply, "but we'll do the
best we can."
The attorney then withdrew, accom
panied by Chief Wittman, who had oc
cupied a seat near the entrance N to the
Commissioners' room.
CHANGE IN THE TIDE.
It is reported that the Commission
ers have come to look more favorably
on Wittman's failure to suppress gam
bling in Chinatown. Their temper is
said to be abating from the high stage
it reached when the Grand Jury made
such caustic comments on the inability
of the department to stop the fantan
games. It does not look now as if
Wittman will be ousted from his office.
The trial of Policeman J. H. Crow
ley, accused of drunkenness while on
duty, was then taken up. He was found
guilty and dismissed from the depart
ment.
The testimony of Frank O'Keefe. the
young man who, -while under the in
fluence of liquor, stabbed Captain Duk<?

BUDD HAS TILT
WITH FERRAL
Eouses Assistant District
Attorney by a Remark Re
garding Eppinger Cases
HONORS ARE ABOUT EVEX
Motion to Set Aside Indict
ment and a Challenge to
Grand Jury Will Be 3lade
A lively passage-at-arms between
ex-Governor Budd and Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Ferral occurred in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday when
the cases of Herman, Jacob and Josua
Eppinger and James Demings. charged
with obtaining money by false pre
tenses, were called ;tor the defendants
to plead.
It had been understood that the cases
would not be set for trial until Attor
ney J. C. Campbell, special prosecutor,
should be present.
Ferral wanted the defendants to
plead, but Budd objected, saying that
it had been stipulated between him and
Attorney Campbell that nothing would
be done till Campbell's return, and as
Campbell had entire charge of the case
for the prosecution, he thought that
the stipulation should be respected.
"It is not* so," retorted Ferral. "The
District Attorney has charge of the
case, and Mr. Campbell is simply as
sisting him."
"That's very strange," said Budd.
"How is it that all the witnesses for
the prosecution are taken to Camp
bell's office and that the banks are
supplying him with the funds to carry
on the prosecution."
"How is it," replied Ferral, "that the
defendants have now engaged an ex-
Governor of California to beat the
case?"
At this Juncture District Attorney
Byington made his appearance and
Budd's rejoinder did not materialize.
It was decided that the cases should
be continued till March 6.
Budd intimated that on behalf of the
defendants he would, at the proper
time, file a motion to set aside the in
dictment and challenge the Grand
Jury.
FURNACE WOULD NOT WORK.
Mr. Small and his family suffered
during the last cold spell, owing to
the fact that their furnace gave out
on one of the coldest nights and there
was no other means of heating the
house. Investigation disclosed the
fact that Master Sam Small had filled
the furnace with everything that 'was
not combustible. It is needless to say
that the young man was the warmest
member in his household when his
father discovered the trick. See next
Sunday's comic for particulars.
of I. W. Parsons. Parsons holds a li
cense to conduct a saloon on Mont
gomery avenue. Besides being a sa
loon-keeper, he is editor of the North
End Review, and as such he is said
to have urged O'Keefe to testify false
ly that the policeman Vas engaged in
wrongful conduct when O'Keefe as
saulted him with the knife. All of
which. Captain Duke complained to
the commission, shows that Parsons is
an improper person to hold a saloon
license. The trial will be resumed next
Friday night.
ELLIS' SQUAD ON TRIAL.
The trial of Policemen Doran, Munn
and McGrath, members of Sergeant
Ellis' former Chinatown squad, was
then called. It had been begun at the
last meeting. L. G. Carpenter, an at
torney who took part in ex-Commis
bioner Hutton's raids of fantan games,
was the lirst witness. He told of the
existence of gambling among the Chi
nese. Incidentally he described the
Chinese Kducational Society, the head
quarters of which was raided recent
ly and a gambling game found in
progress therein, as an "organizatiton
devoted to teaching the Chinese Eng
lish and other branches of schooling."
Foreman Thomas P. Andrews was
called to the stand in an effort to gain
evidence that the Grand Jury had
gathered in its investigation of China
town corruption. Being prohibited by
law from divulging the secrets of the
Grand Jury room, he declined to an
swer. Commissioner Drinkhouse ex
postulated with him and expressed the
opinion that the Grand Jury ought to
aid the commission in its probirigs.
Andrews' retort was full of stings,
though measured out in calm sen
tences.
"I regret," he proceeded, "that the
Board of Police Commissioners was not
a little more patient with the Grand
Jury. I am satisfied that if this board
had not insisted on beginning its in
quiry and thereby interfering with our
efforts, we should have been able to
present a clean-cut case that would
have been much more far-reaching and
startling than the conclusions we were
able to report when we were com
pelled by your action to bring our work
to a close."
President Poheim explained that the
board acted in good faith, having been
led to believe that the Grand Jury was
sidetracking the Chinatown case for
other matters, and that the inquisitors
were not pursuing their work with
proper diligence.
CANT STOP GAMBLING.
The witnesses called were Lee Sing,
Richard Cortier, A. J. Chisholm, A.
McConachie, Joseph A. Kelly, Harry
A. Duffield, Sergeant McMahon and
Sergeant Cook.
"Do you think it is possible to stamp
out gambling among the Chinese?"
Sergeant Cook was asked.
"I don't think so. It can be restrict
ed, but not stamped out. The gam
bling can be stopped in the clubrooms
probably, but there are many secret
places in the big buildings where they
might play."
The commission at this point an
nounced the close of its case, and the
defense began by calling George Dow
ney, a Chinatown watchman, who de
scribed various raids by the squad.
"Why is Sergeant Cook so success
ful in stopping tjÂ»e games?"
"Because he can read Chinese, can
understand it spoken and because the
Chinese believe he has a supernatural
power. They are much in dread of
him. Their superstition leads them to
believe that his mysterious power has
caused the death of four Chinamen.
It's the fear of Cdok's supernatural
powers that stops fantan playing in
Chinatown."
Fred A. Doll, a collector, and E. G.
Buckley, a watchman, testified as to
the efforts the squad made to stop
gambling.
William Doran, one of the accused
policemen, was on the stand when an
adjournment was taken to to-night.

EXPERT DECIDES THAT
DRESS DOES NOT FIT
Judge Daniels Thereupon Gives Judg
ment for Mrs. B. Bernheim. Who
Was Sued by Tailor.
Justice of the Peace Daniels yester
day gave judgment !n favor of Mrs.
B. Bernheim. who was sued by S.
Honig, a ladies' tailor, for $40. the
value of a dress made for the plaintiff.
The case was first tried several months
ago, but Judge Daniels deferred his
decision until expert testimony could
be secured as to the fit of the dress,
upon which Mrs. Bernheim and the
tailor entertained different opinions.
The litigants agreed to abide by the
decision of Mrs. Ada Eckert. a dress
maker employed by a downtown con
cern, who is considered an authority
on the art of dressmaking.
When court convened Mrs. Bern
1 heim retired to the privacy of the ad
joining chambers and arrayed herself
in the garment which caused the dis
j pute. She then came into the court
room and Mrs. Eckerfs expert evi
dence was taken. Mrs. Eckert, with
the air of a connoisseur, thereupon de-
I creed that the waist of the dress was
'â¢ far too tight for the wearer, which
: caused Honig to remark that possibly
Mrs. Bernheim had grown stout in the
| last four months since the dress was
! made. Mrs. Bernheim indignantly de
i nied that she had gained in avoidupois,
' saying on the contrary that if any
â  thing she had become slender. Mrs.
I Eckert pointed out several other de
fects in the dress, which constrained
! Judge Daniels to give judgment in be
! half of Mrs. Bernheim, who sailed tri
j umphantly out of the courtroom to di
â  vest herself of the despised dress in
order to resume her own garments.
