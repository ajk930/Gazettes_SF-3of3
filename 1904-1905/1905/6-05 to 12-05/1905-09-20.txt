McColloch will go to New York to

A scrutiny of the committee books and
legislative journals of both the Senate
and the Assembly for the; session of 1904
does not reveal j any proposed legislation
affecting insurance Interests that would
seem to call " for: the expenditure at that
time .of any large sum of money. Of the
measures killed, a majority were not de
sired- by the big Insurance companies
and the committees. In killing them,
simply responded to the wishes of the In-;
surance lobby. - " .
A former member of the Legislature to
night expressed the belief that the ex
penses of the life insurance companies
were no heavier last rear than they had
been for. ten years back,' and that the Hat
of checks sent by them to ] their Albany,
agents "^o -square accounts" \u25a0 would
average up about the same, most 'of. the

subllcan Convention, to order."
Th!Â» ie a large political \u25a0 assemblage and
tuny visitors are present. \u25a0 It . 'will be neces
sary on the part of every one" here to main
tain decorum so the deliberations and pro
reedings of thi6 convention may not be
marred. - \u25a0 ; - .:
The rood citizens of this community will
watch with deep interest whatever action you
UJre. and they entertain the hope that the
4cket you may place in the field will be for
i clean city, clean politics and a clean ad
ministration. Let their hope be realized and
*cy Will do the rest.
Colonel Sonntag then named Chief Dep
uty County Clerk Charles C Morris to as
Â«iÃt the secretary, Thomas E. Atkinson.
Morris was cheered when he ascended the
platform. The full enthusiasm of the au
lience did not manifest itself, however,
until John S. Partridge, the caucus 'nomi
nee of the convention for Mayor, entered
the hall and took his seat with his dele
ration-that of the Thirty-fifth. Partridge
modestly kept his seat and made no re
Â«ponse to the mighty roar of approval
*&at marked his entrance.
CHEER PABTniDGE'S NAME.
When the cheering had subsided the call
if the Republican County Committee was
read and the call of the roll followed.
When Partridge's name was called more
cheers were given the popular candidate.
The Schmitz claquers in the gallery
\u25a0howled with joy when Maestretti's name
was called, but Chairman Sonntag let it
be known that further interference would
not be tolerated. The claquers were then
lees obnoxious. â¢ '
The calling of the roil completed, nomi
nations for temporary chairman were
called. Edward F. Treadwell took the
platform to nominate Daniel A. Ryan. In
part he .said: . â¢ *\\* \u25a0\u25a0'-' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0- *v-*i.yC
â¢ It has been the hope of evil-minded persons
that this convention might be disorderly and
de' Eire anything except latr play. .I- believe
that we will elect as chairman a man big
enough and brave enough to do right, 'and
that this convention will not be disturbed, but
will be carried on in' an : orderly 'manner. '--*
. During the last few weeks certain men have
been mentioned as> being worthy to bear our
standard In the coming campagln. . During
that time we have heard the praises sounded
of such men as honest John LacJunann and
euch a citizen as honorable Harry Baehr, and
responded with the honor due to that match
less epecimen of American manhood. 1 John S.
Partridge. I3ut we have never heard of a more
courageous man than Daniel iC. Ryan, v He
presents a character that honors any conven
tion he attends. He is a man of the greatest
courage, faithful to his friends, an ardent Re
publican and a Talthful and loyal native son.
1 have great pleasure in nominating as chalr
xr.n of this convention Mr. Daniel A. Ryan.
Before a second to Ryan's nomina
tion could be offered Thomas K. Kase
of the Forty-fourth rose at his place,
refusing to take the platform, and
named Daniel G. Coleman for tempor
ary chairman. In part he said:
I am heartily in accord with the hope that
harmony will characterize thie convention. I
believe the Eentlment of the delegates here
is unanimous that we- shall conduct ourselves
as Republicans and that whatever rivalries
ensue will be renerous in their nature.
\u25a0 It is my Drtvilege to present for your con
sideration to-night another man. The man 1
have in mini is also a native Bon. If you eject
him chairman you will find. that he has all ihe
requirements necessary to enable him to Dron
erly preside over any convention, be Its se.s-
Bion ever so turbulent. I refer to D. G. Cole
man of the Forty -second, whom I now Dlace
In nomination for the chairmanship.
The nomination of Ryan. was second
ed by Senator Bauer of the Forty-first,
David Rich, F. A. Healy and others and
the nomination of Coleman was sec
onded by A. C. Taylor of the Forty
fourth. The seco.nds.for both nomina
tions were still pouring in when a mo
tion broke in above the uproar calling
for the ballot. The motion carried and
then came the tumult.'
...... ttIIAA*. ELECTED CHAIRMAN.- - -
The Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth,
Thirtieth, Thirty-first, Thirty-second
and Tnirtyrtnird districts cast, their
votes solid for Coleman, the west side
of the hall berng-frxed for Ruef and
Schmitz without a break.,; > The Thirty
fourth was i then -announced solid for
Ryan, but howls from the Schmitz wing
of the' convention made it evident that
one or two of the delegates had be
trayed thejr principles arid abandoned
the league.-, The' chairman granted the
demand for tne rollcall and out of the
twenty-three, delegates It was found
that three had prqved disloyal. These
three are Maurice Moreno, Isaac Gibeau
Jr. and John P.. Connors.
The Thirty-fifth stood solid for Ryan
â¢wrlth the exception of . A. T. Gruttner,
who voted for Coleman amid the hoots
of his own delegation." and the cheers
of the Ruefites. The Thirty-sixth voted
solidly Xor Ryan, but in the Thirty-sev
enth one. disloyal delegate^ E. C. Cook,
was found. He voted for Coleman.
D. B. Faktor of the Thirty-eighth
also abandoned his delegation, voting
for Coleman, and A. A. Friedlander as
tonished all by declining to vote, his
courage falling him when the crucial
moment arrived. F. A. Maestretti, who
headed the Thirty-ninth delegation, an
nounced its solid vote for Coleman. The
Fortieth voted solidly for Ryan. " Mor
ris Behan bolted his delegation in the
Forty-first and voted -for Coleman. be
ing hooted for his conduct.
"The Forty-second delegation . was
solid for Ryan, as was the Forty-third.
The Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth were
solid for Coleman.
.When It . w.as seen that Ryan had
been elected to the chair a roar of . ap
proval 'burst- from 'his supporters',. while
the Ruef end of. the convention howled
and hooted" in Its rage. It was some
moments before quiet was sufficiently
restored to enable the chair. .to" an
nounce the rote. When it was an
nounced-Ryan.* 223.- Coleman 175, the
mingled. Â«houts of approval # and;Â« rage
again . broke out: â¢ When? order' was
again restored Coleman. the defeated
candidate, and Delegate:Treaflwell were
appointed to Ryan to: the chair.
W^en : Ryan reached . the" platform \ he
fc'as greeted enthusiastically." ,lby his
importers, but the callery hooted and
howled and continued the uproar until
Sonnta? threatened to -clear the house
of all but delegates. - ..
STANDS FOII FAIRNESS.
Ryan -then addressed the gathering,
winning respect,, for the firmness of his
attitude, though hoodlumlsm was still
rampant and he suffered many inter
ruptions during the progress of his
speech. Chairman Ryan said:
Mr. Chairman, Fellow Delegates and Yellow
Republican*: I stand before you to acknowl
edge the compliment by which I have been
made chairman of this splendid convention.
Gentlemen, if you are all Republicans and
good citizens you will at least listen. I say to
you. gentlemen, that Tarn proud of the honor'
tr-at you have given to me. You must- be sur
prised that any one EhouM aspire to the Job
tilled capably by our present chairman,- Colonel
Sonntag. I highly appreciate the honor and
accept the chair.
- It is an honor to preside over a convention
\u25a0of. my fellow citizens, selected by the people of
San Francisco. It is indeed, a compliment to
be chosen by Â«uch a convention â truly a dis
tinction
It is a solemn duty, this American privilege,
to "cho6se Jrom' our- citizens those who shall
govern. us and whom we agree to uphold â men
who shall stand for , decency *ln public and
private life.' When a man who has risen 'to a
high place in the' public service -outrages the
people by -violating his .word it is '. our privilege
.10. retire him .to private life. ..:- . ;
And it is given us, when a servant is found
wanting in any of these essentials, to drag
him "from the sacred station which he has dis
honored and to heap upon him' ttie contempt
and scorn of an outraged people. ' Citizens of
Pan Francisco, the name of your city stands
in ill repute by reason thereof, and, (notwith
standing that it possesses great and vast
resources, and capital is everywhere, I.ts very
bonds are' not acceptable to me investor. This
condition prevails because corruption abounds,
graft exists. laws are not enforced, confidence
is "shaken, and the : people dwell in the 'dark
shadows of uncertainty and doubt. Even our
greatest necessities have been overlooked and
neglected. .Our streets unpaved and unswept,
our school buildings old and dilapidated I and
our -sewer system ancient, insufficient and dis
ease breeding. ..If under such adverse circum
stances San Francisco Is a thriving and .pros
perous city, who can foretell the extent of her
prosperity if her people have occasion to feel
that eecurity which comes of good govern
ment? â¢ â¢ '
As chairman I will treat all with equal jus
tice, \rtll recognise all entitled .to recognition,
and every man who conducts - and comporta
himself as a gentleman will -be treated ' with
consideration, and I say to you at . the start
that, while I intend to give eijual justice to
all. I will not be bluffed (by any man. :I: I prom
ise to treat you fairly, and I ask you in turn
that you treat me fairly. â¢ ..\u25a0\u25a0'.

*.. A. 'K. Daggett next offered the fol
ldTrlirg" resolution:' "f , :: ' '-.;:â¢â¢'..'
Whereas. Charles Sonntag *"ls the ' a.ctlnp r
chairman -of the Republican County Committee
of \u25a0 the city "and .^county: of San Francisco and
aa such acting chairman has taken ' the side
of richt and . decency in all political matters
and has Â»-hown his loyalty to the San Fran
cisco Republican' League, whose principles he
has strongly Indorsed by- word: and action;
now, therefore, be it , , . â¢-- . , â¢
Resolved. That this convention. through \u25a0 its
officers and "delegates ttnder to the said Charles
Sonntag the privilege of the floor and request
him to take a seat on the platform.
. The resolution carried with cheers
from" the league wing and hoots and.
hisses from the Ruefltes.. Mr, Sonntag
appreciated the honor, however, and re
mained on the platform, "an interested
spectator. '"â¢,-, -t
The Irrepressible ;McGushin again
gained the platform at this point and
said: ~*ar -*; v* '.-
"I - won't use "any ~ blarney this time 1
because you all" know now since 1 have
displayed my fighting .propensities that
I am all right.' If I didn't fight / 1
wouldn't be worthy of my race. And
I am now going to offer a resolution
that will test your Republican princi
ples. It is as follows:
We commend and indorse the illustrious aa
tninistration of the chief standard-bearer of
our party, the President of our â¢ nation. The
oCore' Roosevelt, and the policies -and prin
ciples of the \u25a0 Republican party for which he
stands, and which have given to this country
the peace and prosperity which have "made us
the most 'notable 'nation- in' the annals or
civilization.- and we -point out to our fellow
citizens .the difference between- the results ol
these .policies and principles and those whieft
wourd have flowed from Democratic success
hi recent elections. The policies of the Repub-Â»
lican'i party: mean ..happiness, ' contentment,
wealth and progress for the entire community,
while those of the Democratic party' have ever
resulted In unhappinese, misery, want j and
stagnation. -
We indorse the economical and' business-like
administration of the State Government iby
Governor George . C. Pardee. whose career In
office is a triumph of Republican principles
and policies and an inspiration for future
action and success on the part of his fellow
Republicans. \u25a0 â¢ .- - â¢\u25a0_ - . . \u25a0 . \u25a0 ,
\u25a0 We. pledge all our nominees to a strict ad
herence to the principles and policies of The
odore Roosevelt and of George C. Pardee.
McGushln moved that the., committe.e
on platform and resolutions be in
structed to Incorporate his composition
in-the platform-,- but he was -defeated,
a motion that all resolutions be re
ferre.d to the committee and.be passed
upop by it before to the
convention being adopted. The conven
tion then adjourned to next Friday
night at 8 o'clock. .
. Thoroughly beaten on every. point :the
Ruefites filed out to fliscuss the situa
tion. Ruef. was mad clear through. 3
"That's the-dlrtiest work I ever saw
in a convention in my life," he said.
He had no further comment to make. â¢
HOODLUMS IX EVIDENCE.
Chairman Ryan was warmly cheered at
the conclusion,; of his address, the hoots'
of the Ruefltes losing, some of their vim',
the language of the chairman making it
apparent that' he would, not tolerate the
hoodlum tactics ... of .. th*e delegates that
were opposed to " decency. > Ryan -then
calUd for nominations for vice chairman;
Luther Elkins of the Forty-third, after
congratulating the convention upon -its
selection' of Its efficient chairman, placed
William H. Davis of \u25a0> the Forty-third in
nomination for 'vice." Chairman.' His nom
ination was seconded by Walter, S. Brann"

as. far as Mount Atyati. a very high
mountain of , the Alaskan Range, where
the greenstone formation is lost under
the glaciers of that mountain and

Mount Atyati to be almost or quit* as
high as St. Elias. "> The ore Is, of the

Nabesna .copper is found in bands of
greenstone 'ln .ehot-llke shape, often
carrying. 10 to ' 30 per cent of : metallic
copper. .There.la also, much copper on
the White River, where It Is In slab
like shape, arfd pieces were found run
nlng.from two to four feet In width
and'two^.inches thick.- These slabs lay
in s eams in greenstone, : making the
most,, wonderful surface showing Brat
nober Iras, ever seen in j this or foreign
countries.
Eight v miles .farther up the White
River copper occurs in-th'e same formar
tion in nugget shape,- the nuggets
running from half an ounce to two
ounces. ; The formation here is about
500 feet wide, ; with ;. vast quantites of
copper lying) at" the. fbotS>f- the hills,
where the greenstone has decomposed
and "the copper , ore washed down In
ravines. The^ gravel is full of native
copper, whlchf- lies .. on -.* the : surface liÂ»

of vigorous development work will de
velop a copper mine Â»which can produce
from two to three thousand tons a day.
The ores will be hauled by railroad to
Valdez and reduced' there by smelter.
The construction of a railroad, he de
clares, will, quickly make it the largest
copper producing district in the world,
the surface showing being undoubtedly
the most favorable that has ever been
discovered. The copper veins on Na

feet wide and seem: very continuous.
His men are making about twenty good
locations on this river. ., Where the slab
copper occurs ' the formation is; very
wide, running from 300 to 400 feet.
Five or six locations 'will be made here.

Rosene's railroad up the Copper River
will have ' a" water "grade to Nabesna

divide to Nabesna. About sixty-five miles'
above Valdez a branch road, will run thir
ty-five miles to the Bonanza copper mines
owned by the The main
line ' will be' continued to a distance of
about 160 miles from Valdez, where it will
again branch to the right with a . line
about seventy miles to ; Nabesna.
\u25a0 The bonanza mines are of'entlrely differ
ent formation, being a bornite and sulphide
proposition like the Montana mines.' These
ores must *be roast.cd and concentrated at
the mines and then " shippe-" by rail '; to
Valdez for "refining or shipment by water
to Puget Sound.".; The" Hayemeyers have a
force of men doing development work un
der the direction of Stephen' Birch* of
Ne^ York, a nephew of the Havemeyers.
Bratnober says that â¢ the Bonanza' group
promises to"beeome;ttie first big copper
producer -in that section because it. wfll
be reached by a railroad. a. year or two

NEW "LEX"
Losses Sustained by New;

Large Loan Made Good
'ijyVtlie Equitable Society
Continued from Page V Col. 3.
I together with the snmof J7l*,2M. with ta
â¢ terest, growing out of the ** so-called
' "Turner loans," aggregating an amount
r considerably in excess of 51.000.000. Thla â¢
l^sum,- Morton contends, is due the Equl
table from the Mercantile Trust, which
I has been one of the most important or Its
[ subsidiary Institutions.
Concerning the "Turner loans" ' (aggre
gating, with Interest, $561,491) Morton ex
plains thai the Equitable held about
two-fifths of the stock -of tnÂ« Western
National Bank. Before the Equitable
Society became Interested In the stpclc
of this bank, the latter had made certain
loans upon collateral as follows:
To John W. Youngâ
Salt Lake and Fort Douglass Railroad
Company, bonds and stock: , Salt
Lake and Eastern Railroad Company,
stock; Salt Lake Dock Company,
stock; Demlng. Sierra Madre and Pa
cific Railway Company, stock.. v. ....$113,065

ber Company â

Southeastern Kentucky .... ....''.. 258,304

Colorado 264,501
Total $638,049
Interest to Novnnber 15, 1904 25,443
Total : 1.. $661,401
The loans not being paid, the bank took:
over the so-called "collateral". which a
bank, examiner objected .to. . Henry B.
Hyde then arranged for Its transfer to
the Mercantile Trust Company by assign
ing it to a "dummy," viz.: George V.
Turner, private secretary to Louis Fitz
gerald, then president of the Mercantile
Trust v Company. Contemporaneously
with this,' Turner secured from, the Trusty
Company on this \u25a0 "collateral" a loan of .
$661,491 and this amount was turned over
to the bank in payment for the collateral
which it had assigned to Turner.
Mr. Morton says:
"I have been unable, to form t definite
opinion as to the value of the properties
by which the 'Turner loans' are secured
They, certainly Bare a substantial value
and the officers of the Mercantile Trust
Company are sanguine that they will
ultimately produce sufficient money for
the liquidation of the loans. In any event
the individual guarantors of loans, In
cluding the estates of Henry B. Hyde and
Marcellus Hartley, are amply responsible
and tbÂ« \u25a0 Trust Company, -by enforcing Its
rights against them, should be able to es
cape'unltimate loss."
Morton also reported to the directors
that It would be neccessary to ob&rge off
$S6,4SS unpaid balance of a loan to John
E.*"Searles, who has gone through bank
ruptcy; The collateral against this $56,453,
Morton declared, was without value. .
Of the mysterions $683,000 loan. made by
the Mercantile Trust Company , on the*
"J. W. A. No. 3 account," Morton said,
that no such loan had been authorized by
the society and then repudiated. The
"J. "W. A. No. 3 account" loan was re
j paid recently by Individuals. Morton dis
covered, however, that from 1901 to 1904
the Equitable paid $265,000 on this loan
and' he has instructed "counsel"; "to take
. the necessary proceedings to' recover
these amounts for the society."
The Searles loan was originally $340,000
and was reduced to $86,488.
At the. conclusion of his report, Morton
â¢ "Incase other transactions of this char
acter arc developed, you will be duly

that General Rafael Reyes, President of

September 16 and imprisoned the mem

many of the rioters. The reports say that

Btaying at present in this city. When in
formed of the Panama dispatch to-night,
he said:
**I don't believe there Is a word of
truth in the resort. I had a cable dis
patch from Bogota two days ago, and it
said that the country was in complete
and absolute peace and that President
Reyes was engaged in th^ reconstruction
of the Colombian finances. If . anything
of importance occurred, I would surely
have been informed of it. I am sure
there Is no disturoance in Colombia.'"

TORONTO. Ont_ Sept. 19. â The. On
tario Fisheries Department .. will insti
tute a rigid Investigation into alleged
illegal fishings by American, firms in
Georgian Bay and Lake Erie. It is
claimed that thousands of tons of fish
Illegally, taken are shipped to the
United States every" week. â ;
The chances taken by fishermen on
Lake Erie of clashing with the Gov
ernment's cruiser Vigilant ; are not > the
only means taken by American firms
to get ; fish from Canadian waters, ac
cording to a Government official. It is
alleged that they secure the services
of- licensed Canadian fishermen and
supply them with nets and tugs." The
Canadian' fishermen then turn their
catches; over to boats. belonging to the
American companies.

OTHER ROADS
ARE INVOLVED
Local railroad officials are anxiously
awaiting a . move on the \u25a0 part of the \u25a0 In
terstate .Commerce Commission in regard
to the recent discoveries made by secret
agents that several of the Middle West
ern lines . have been . paying rebates to
shippers in this city. The news that the
Washington authorities were on the track
of a number ! of violators of the : Elkins
'bill/has caused no end of -excitement In
local railroad circles. For the last two
days the wires between this city, and
Chicago have been kept hot with in
quiries regarding the , matter and as a
result there is not' a general agent in San
Francisco who is not prepared to explain
Just : why his own road of late has been
unable to land some of the big . west-;
bound freight shipments.
\u25a0 Since the first news. was given out that
damaging ; evidence had been" - secured
against several local merchants/ who
have been receiving rebates from, the Chi
cago ; and" Great ; Western . and - the ' St.
Joseph and Grand . Island roads; 1 * it : has
become known that the Interstate \u25a0 Com
merce Commission has equally ttrong evi
dence showing that the lowa Ointral and
the Lake Erie and Western^ lines t have
also been Violating t the . law j by; paying re
bates. In fact, it is now claimed that one
agent has 'been working mC the" Interest
of . the^f our roads and paying rebates ' of
$5 and $10 a carload for freight, according"
to which way it' was shipped.
The secret agents sent here < discoverec/
that a big contracting. firm that is about
to construct one of the tall downtown
buildings; entered Into an agreement with
the representatives of the Â» Chicago * and
Great Western and the ; St. Joseph : and
Grand . Island roads for the handling- of
the westbound material : for A the \ new
building. .; Certain 'rebates were agreed
upon, but the contract * had . to be finally
dissolved for the reason; that the loss in
time experienced by :, the contractors
while awaiting the ] arrival of ; their, ma
terial amounted ". to more ; , in I the way * of
money than would have : been ;derlved lin
the way , of rebates 'on , their 5 freight. :"
It is said that one ;; obstacle : that ;; has
stood in the way; of ; prosecuting \ the ; of-;
fending merchants '\u25a0\u25a0 as f well as \ the rail
roads has treen a recent Vdecislon sof the
United States Court in? the , East * that
where freight is solicited by a â¢ broker
through whom the rebate 1 is. afterward
paid; a conviction ; under the 1 Elkins v la w
cannot be obtained. ?In j several '.of the lo
cal cases unearthed, by the secrets agents
sufficient evidence to prove that the soli
citors for the freight: handled by* the ;
roads under suspicion . were c- acting/ ; as
agents ; and ' not as brokers 1 has ' not ; been
obtained. It.is': claimed, however," that
there ' Hi' strong evidence ; in other c cases,
and: prosecutions .will follow.

VALJLEJO, Sept. 19.-â Judge Advocate
Ernest ; E. \u25a0 West sprung ral big surprise ; at

Commander | Lucin Young ' this morning
when * he \ requested "that % the ; ' testimony
of Ensign V Charles T. Wade .\u25a0\u25a0'; be; tak

were called. .There were other "mem
bers of ; the Bennington's cre w. : outside
the door of the courtroom" waiting;; to
testify, but , the : prosecuting -attorney
waved them aside "\u25a0- and asked that 'the
court adjourn to the bedside of the
young. officer -ilni the hospital. -
The court marched out to the hos
pital and then marched back; again.
The testimony; of I Ensign^ Charles \Wade
was not ? taken. H; The ; advice .of Dr.'
Charles E. Smith, attached' to lthe Mare
Island Hospital, :,who ' swore ; that a : pro
longed crass-questioning, would seri
ously affect his patient, was taken, and,
the ' 5 Objection Ito \u2666 proceeding 1 with ';. thÂ«
sick man/ made by Judge Gear, wu
sustained. \/_ J - .
The request wag entirely i unexpected.
The ; defense stood aghast and ; even f the
faces : of the officials : of ' the court ? plainly
showed their surprise f at the speech of
Captain ' WÂ«st. , ; Lieutenant % Wade they
know was very 111 at the Navy Hospital,
. slowly recovering , from | one " of the sever
est operations for appendicitis ever known
to medical : experts. , A ; scarce two ' weeks
had passed since the ; knife had "\u25a0 entered
his vitals , and during { this time -he , had'
been suffering fearful agonies. Could his
mind remain clear during all this'suffer
ing? Could he stand ! questioning on a
subject which to - him ; must be . one of
terrible memory, a reminder of the death
of sixty-six of his shipmates by an' explo-*
sion_ of which : thÂ« Secretary" of the Navy,
has "said he is the cause Could he" stand
the hours of cross-questioning under which
Judge Gear. was sure to grill him in'order
to get out the facts which would clear his
client. Commander Young? "These were
the questions which passed through the
minds of the , thirteen members of the
court when the adjournment was ordered.'
' WEST IS AMAZED. ,%T"
When Captain West heard the decision
of the court he seemed \u25a0 amazed; : During
the last few days jhe has seemed Ito ? f eel
that the weight? of i evidence lay- against
him and now he appeared unable 'i to pro
ceed.\ ."I'do not see how~ I > can go i fur
ther without^ the; testimony -of' Knsign
Wade," he said, "for I regard that the
most important." , ' ' L
"He -will be" better able to talk in a
week," answered? the court, "and we will
not hear rhim until then."- : ,
Shortly betore i noon the thirteen mem
bers of the court / marched .to the Ben

VOTERS REFTSE TO REGISTER.
Odessa Citizens Regard tbe Popular
Election nÂ» a Farce.
ODESSA, Sept. 19. â The registration
here in; connection with the elections
to the National Assembly" shows a
somewhat remarkable' condition of af
fairs. " Only .115 out of 7000. qualified
voters thus far; have placed their
names on the voting registers. ThÂ«
fact that the.i 520.000 inhabitants of this
great port are allowed only a slngl*
representative led to action on the part
of the municipal authorities, who,"an
ticipating the failure of the .elections,
vainly petitioned the. Government to
give Odessa another deputy. The mil
itary restrictions preclude the possibil
ity of an election campaign.. 'Advices
from Kieff, Ekaterlnoslav ' and Khar
koff' show similar conditions. Only
four days remain for registration.

Johnson asked if Mr. Page put up $25,

Jadse de Haven Oremxlea the Demur
rer Interposed by Attorneys for the
Persons -Heretofore' lndicted.
United States District Judge de: H
aven yesterday overruled the demurrer
Interposed by Frank & Mansfield
against the Indictment charging , Rpb
ert J. Tyson. Alexander McLean, 8. E.
R. de Bmidt, "W". J. "Wood and W. J.
Woodslde with having consptred "to
commit an offense against the United
States by outntting a vessel for. the
purpose of .poaching \u25a0on the fur seal
fisheries In Bering Sea. The basis 'of
the demurrer was that the Indictment
did not charge the defendants with the
commission of any crime and that there
was no law in the United States pro
hibiting the killing of seals In . the
Bering Sea except by a citizen of the
United States or by the use of a ves
sel of American registry.
The Indictment nowhere alleges that
the" defendant* were citizens of the
United States : and ' the allegation is
made that at the time of the alleged
poaching the Carmenclta was a vessel
under the Mexican flag. The date 'of
the beginning of the alleged conspir
acy, however, is fixed when . the same
vessel, then known as the Jennie The
lin. was under the American flag.

Accepts \. the 'Offer .From, President Eliofc
I FORMER -STANFORD PROFESSOR." WHO WAS DISMISSED BY PRESIDENT
JORDAN. -HE- HAS'JUST BEEN MADE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
GERMANIC 1 LiANGUAGES AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY.
Dr. Julius GoebeV former head, of the
department of - Germanic languages at
the- Stanford University,- has- received
an n:.-pv,:..:;nent to - a similar, position,
at Harvard [ University. 1 :A. telegram
was \u25a0 received : late , Monday night from
President Eliot of Harvard by Dr. Goe
bel'- and he Immediately telegraphed
his acceptance .of the' offer." ~- â¢ .
This was the second offer- that Dr.
Goebel received : from Harvard. . The
first came from President Eliot two
weeks ago. With it .was, coupled; the
information that â¢ B.jvon Jageman's po
sition was. open to him. . .
Dr. Goebel at\ that' time informed
President Eliot" that" he"".would- not ac
cept â¢ the position .. until"; his , dismissal
from Stanford University, had : been
thoroughly .investigated- by the . head
of the . Eastern: university. ,The docu
ment* in . the case that was before the
Stanford- trustees' were "sent, to ' Pres
ident Eliot. â¢ That the' President of Har
vard'was. satisfied was signified by the
message that came to Dr.' Goebel Mon-.
day night. -.
The department '; of " Germanic lan
guages . at : Harvard â¢ Is considered- to \be
the best among the.u niversities of the
United ' States, and" ther honor of ".being
appointed .to | the; head . of "â¢ the [ depart
ment,ls very gratifying to Dr. Goebel.
Dr.. Goebel Raid f last night: : r
"My reason for not accepting â¢ President
Eliot's ; offer to -become ; head of the de
partment ; of German - philology - at . ' Har
vard sooner, was because of "the unpleas
ant j notoriety attached \to my ; deposition
and the libelous statements made against
me by President Jordan of Vol
unteer vindication of any of Jordan's.;al
legations, which were sent - to President
Eliot <of Harvard by the . Stanford trus
tees, places me 'ln the right light: before
the public and surely counteracts r the in
sults heaped on me since my. deposition. '
"If my. reputation was in any way sul
lied I would still hesitate about accepting
President Eliot's offer. After attempts to
bribe me and use. of. other means to hush
the differences between Jordan' and my
self I feel now that I am placed rightly
before the '\u25a0 public Â» in : being -. asked ;to the
chair of th* greatest university In Ameri
ca, I would'have accepted the offer. even
though I had been still head of the Ger
man department at Stanford. The ' sal
ary and honor would have made it a suf
ficient inducement . for -me to resign here
'even though the circumstance of my; re
moval , had ' not \u25a0 occurred. The German
and educational' societies which were soil 2 -'
citous about my welfare ] will be pleased
with my new honors' and "when 7 this news

BERKELEY, Sept. , 19.â Prof essor
Jacques Loeb has just published;
through' the university press,; a bulle
tin dealing- with his^attempts . to pro
duce an artificial membrane around
the starfish. A similar attempt under
taken with sea urchins was successful.
Both experiments are in the- line of
research having as its object the" dis
covery of the origin of life in its lower
forms. .
.Writing of his latest achievement Dr.
Loeb says: i: .T^c^ v
Two years , ago I . published avmethod
whereby the : egg of ' the sea-urchin ! can be ler
tllized by the- eperni of' all kinds, of. starfish.
This method consisted in Â». rendering the sea
water slightly alkaline (or increasing: Its .alka
linity slightly above the limit of alkalinity it
naturally ' reaches). . It "is- probable -that this ;
increase in. alkalinity serves solely, the, purpose j
of making if possible for . the â¢ starfish sperm-!
atozoon to fuse with the protoplasm of the sea- j
urchin's egg; and. it ia not very probable that j
the increased alkalinity Is â¢ required for "aug
menting or : modifying the. fertilizing power-ot
the starfish \u25a0 spermatozoon. \u25a0,'â¢â¢- \u25a0 â¢"â¢' ?
, Since the entrance of the . starfish spermato-
Boon into, the -egg 'of 'the sta-urchln also' calls
forth the - formation of . a membrane In this |
egg, it looks as if the fertilization of the star- j
fish egg were caused 'by , the ; same or similar
chemicals which cause the j fertilization of I the'
egg of the, sea-urchin.' I have recently) under-;
taken, some experiments on the;- egg of .the
starfish for the. purpose of deciding , this ques
tion. The starfish used in these experiments
was the asterina from - the bay .of Monterey.
The egg of \ this starfish ' Is Â» especially well
adapted for the : investigation ; of this question,
Blnce it also forms a membrane. upon. the en- I
trance of .the \u25a0 Bpermatpzoon. \u25a0â¢\u25a0.â¢'. \u25a0 , - * "'; \u25a0 \u25a0 I
The first task was to discover whether the j
substances which : call forth' the artificial mem- ;
brane formation , in , the egg of | the . sea-urchin
act In the same way upon the unfertilized egg
of asterlnaT- This Is,: Indeed, the case; the only
difference being that it requires, as a rule, : a
higher concentration of these substances in
the ' case . of , aster|na . and t in ' the case of the
sea-urchin.. â¢-\u25a0â¢' 5 ' \
Our former . publications on .an improved
method -of artificial , parthenogenesis .: In sea
urchins have shown ' that the ; membrane for
mation, or the process which Â«- results in the
membrane formation, .is Â» an - essential ; part \u25a0; of
the normal process of fertilization, as â¢ well as
of - a complete \u25a0 physico-chemical ' Imitation ~of
this process. - The question : arises,": is this also
true in the case |of i the . starfish ? - In order,, to
decide this, we must' compare the , behavior iof
eggs of â¢ asterina . in which ;. the â¢ membrane ; for
mation .has been' called forth by artificial
means with those in which â¢ no : membrane for
mation â¢ has been produced. " . Before Â«we - state
this difference It may be well to recall the fact
that the eggs of .the, starfish differ . In .an es
sential point . from .. those,' of ' the '- sea-urchins.'
StrongyloeentrotUÃ'. and -Arbacia. '*â¢ The. eggs -of,
thÂ« starfish I show a* slight tendency to | develop
spontaneously . without Â». any i external Influence.
It : perhaps expresses . the . difference â¢ partly . (but
only partly) when we '. state that the ', mature
egg. of asterina is in somewhat similar condi
tion into which : the eggs of Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus are brought â¢ by > a one and >a , half
to two - hours' treatment with hypertonlc sea
water. â¢"" ; "'.."..".' : ",..\u25a0" "\u25a0 \u25a0
Following . a technical discussion of
his experiments Dr. j Loeb says:
We 5 have, therefore, two . types lof â¢ develop
ment In tlwse eggs. One type is "represented by
the . fertilised i egg. and this ' type â¢ can -bÂ« â¢\u25a0 pro
duced artificially. In a number of eggs, at least,^
by calling ; forth â¢ the : membrane ' formation by.
artificial means.* The second type is represent
ed . by ; the spontaneously ' developing _â¢ egg â¢In
which no membrane formation . has WÂ«B called
forth;: these latter Â«ggs begin to SGftmpt later,
and ; possibly \u25a0 develop more S slowly .,. taan \u25a0 ' the'
other, eggs, and form . larvae â¢ which ; an tot as
perfect as those belonging < tor the' &T*t? type.
The .'number -of eggs "which ; undergo ' Wide-e \u25a0\u25a0 de-'
velopmentof the ; second type ; can be increased
by putting the eggs for some time Into acidu
lated - sea-water, , even At . tills ' ; treatment does '
not lead: to a' membrane formation. This fact
had- already been established by;; the experi
ments of Nellson and? myself, \ and ' of Delage.- f
.; Charles ". D.' Snydef, Â« an assistant 1 of
Professor Loeb, has - issued a bulletin
in : conjunction 'y withv the â¢ work of :: his
chief, f entitled "The .' Influence' of ... Tern-'
perature Upon Cardiac Contraction and
Its : Relation ?to E Influence ofÂ»Tempera

BLOCK BURNED IN OAKLAND
Fire in Planing #lill and Lumg^^Yard
Section Causes Loss of $BG-f3<3o. i
I SCENE AT THE FIRE THAT BROKE OUT YESTERDAY- AFTBRXOON \u25a0IX THE.-
STANDARD PLANING MILLS IN OAKLAND. v PRACTICALLY ,THE ENTIRK
BLOCK WAS DESTROYED BEFO RE. THE FLAME&"\V^RI2 EXTINGUISHED.
OAKLAND. Sept. 19. â Fire that
started this afternoon at 3 o'clock in
the Standard Planing Mills, 526 -Second
street, swept the block bounded by
Second, Third, Washington and Clay
streets, destroying mills; iron "works,
dwellings and other shops, causing- a
loss of between $80,000 and $90,000, and
leaving nothing but charred embers to
mark the section* of busy industrial
life. So swiftly did the fire run that
before the department apparatus was
on the scene the big mills were a mass
of flames that fairly tore through the
flimsy buildings. A general alarm
brought all of the fire department
forces to the scene. Only the utmost'
efforts of the firemen checked the
flames from sweeping out of the block
and destroying the many mills and
factories that faced the block in which
the fire was confined.
Because of the almost prohibitive
rates, insurance was light and many
of the losses were not covered.
W. J. Ifoth. proprietor of the Stand
ard Mills, was caught in the second
story of the building and hemmed in.
He escaped by dropping down the side
of the mill by- a rope. C. Jensen of
876 Seventh street, an employe of the
mill, was also caught in the flames
and had to slide down a lumber chute
to save himself. He was cut and torn
by splinters, his injuries being dressed
at the Receiving Hospital. O. R. Bent
son of 52$ Twenty-seventh street, a
Standard Company mill hand, was
burned on the hands while trying to
cave* tools. Mra. A. M. Dlxon's gar
ments caught fire while she was drag
ging- furniture from her cottage at 652
Clay street. She saved herself, but
was burned on the hands.
MILLS SOOX AFLAME.
When the firemen arrived the Stan
dard Mill was enveloped and the lire
hud swept into the Bay City Planing
Mills, E. L. Reed owner, adjoining- on
Second street. Both of these factories,
with their Inflammable piles of lumber,
finished and unfinished work, were in
flames in a few minutes. Water had
no effect on the mass. The fire swept
on eastward, striking the big two
story, lodging-house and saloon of P.
Lavorel at the northwest corner of
Washington and Second streets. Then
another leap of the flames that ran
through the block attacked the .'Bay
City Iron Works at the southwest cor
ner of Third and Washington streets.
Though this was a large brick struc
ture, -with metal roof. It' could- not
withstand the rush of fire. As the
flan>es swept along the shops of S. J.
M. Coates on Second street, west of the
Standard Mills, were cleaned to a rub
bish heap of cinders. As Coates' place
burned the flames were carried ' still
farther wÂ«t ag&lnst * the- light- breeze,
setting flre to a rowj>f fire cottages
facing Clay street, north from Second.
The occupants had warning- In time to
save their household effects, which
were carried, out -by- volunteers and
piled promiscuously, across the street.
- In Its pathway. northward through
the block the fire destroyed a row of
shops along Third street, among them
being those of J. T. Carrier & Sons,
Etalrbuilders; E. C * Ecranton, wood
turner, and J. Brandt, blacksmith. An
unoccupied cottag-e was also destroyed.
At the Bouthwest corner of- Clay- and
Third streets stood a couple of two
story frame- buildings owned by
Charles' Roeth and occupied Iby R.
Munce, blacksmith, and the Pacific Nov
elty Pottery. Works. Munce's shop was.
badly eutted, but the pottery- works
escaped. \u25a0 Here -the \u25a0 firemen made .a
stand,' using: the large monitor stream
of four combined hose lines to combat
the roaring flames. These,' with the
blackened row- of- cottages -oa .Clay
street, marked the western edge of the
fire's Â«weep. Nothing was left on
Third street' but they battered, black
ened ruins of the. Bay City. *ron^Works
and the Munce building:. Along Wash
ington street â¢ south : of ,the\lron^,works
stood unharmed a portable house
owned tty Burnham, Standeford &â¢ Co/
It escaped damage. Next' south were
three small shacks, owned by the Lav
ortle, end their destroyed building. on
the corner" finished the fire's work 1 on
that side -of the block.' The-Second
etreet front of the block , was . swept
clean. \u0084â¢..-.-.. \ .
WORKMEX SAVE JIUILDIXGS. .
Directly across Second â¢ 6trâ¬et from
where the fire started stands , the big
frame buildings and lumber piles' ~i of
Burnham, . Standeford & ,Co.'s planing
mills, the Oakland Planing Mills^and the
Sperry Flour Company's warehouses and
barns. . The lumber piles" caught fire re
peatedly. Gangs of â¢ workmen ..from the
mills labored effectively, and -saved ', the
buildings. Had" the fire got' into. the t lum
ber the. department ; could not have' con
trolled it. Across. Washington street the
shops of .\V. Hamelin & Co., blacksmiths,
were -In constant .danger. Streams of
water were kept playing on the wooden
front* which was several times ablaze
from the sparks, and the intense heat
from the burning mills.
Many of the workmen in the planing
mills lost their tools, so little time was
there to get anything out of reach of the
ewift rush of fire. .
At the outset the firemen were ham
pered somewhat by a light pressure from
the water mains, but before long this
was remedied, and heavy streams from a
dozen hydrants were aoon in service.
Chief Engineer Ball's efforts were direct
ed solely to the flames within
the block. He knew the, danger that ex
isted In the possibility of the- extension
of the fire outside of bounds.
The fire started In the rear of the Stan
dard Mill, either from an overheated box
or from spontaneous combustion at a
sandpaper machine. )An alarm was
sounded from Second and Jefferson
streets, followed soon afterward by a
general alarm from, the same box 65.' A

Issues Statement on Work
and What He Desires of

BERKELEY,. Sept. 19.â; Without loss of
anytime Professor Wolle is to enter upon
his work "as instructor in music at the
university. 'To-morrow morning he will
meet students whose voices ar^ , to be
tried by him,- and who" are to be passed
upon as. candidates- for membership in a
great- chorus he will organize at the uni
versity.
; He ' issued through the university ad
ministration offices this afternoon the
following statement . regarding "his J work,
and the part he desires students to take
in it:
It Is Dr. "W'olle's feeling that through the
opportunity of membership In a chorus which
shall --render great musical works, the stu
dents oi the university can recelv-e In the hlgh
â¢ est degree and In the broadest . way . the op
portunUics represented by the establishment of
this department. " \u25a0 ' ' â¢ . /
' It -Is his urgent desire^ that -all U\<> siudsnts
at. the university- should realize that technical
knowledge iof music is wholly unnecessary for
membership In the university chorus. No stu
dent should, refrain from trying '.to- become *
memtÂ«?r"of the chorus, merely because .he -Is not
already familiar' withâ sight â¢ reading. > -It-. .1s
unnecessary that ' candidates, for .the chorua
should know one note from another."
Beginning with to-morrow (Wednesday, Sep
tember 20. ,U)Ca,>. Professor VWolle will dÂ«" at
Stiles Hafl from Â£11- to A 12 . on Monday "and
Wednesday mornings and from 2 to 5 on other
afternoons, to try: the- voices of the; students
desirous of Joining the. chorus. It is his plan
that \u25a0, the -first general : meeting of the chorus
shall be* Tield in. Hearst Hall at T:3O p. m;.
next Tue.oday. September 2t5. Regular rshear
sals will -be held * every Tuesday and Thurs
day evenings and will last for an hour. Uni
versity credit of one unit per week is ottared
lor membership In the chorus. ~ This additional
unit will b* permitted no matter for how many

FIRES IN FORTS

Three Conflagrations of a
Suspicious Mature Arouse
the Military Authorities
INQUIRY TO BE MADE
Magazines. Barracks, Hospi
tals and Guns Destroyed
Upon Different Occasions
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.â Four mysterious
fires in three of the forts protecting lyew
York harbor within the Fast two months
have Caused the military authorities of
the Department of the East much con
cern. Two of the fires have been at Fort
Hamilton, one on the night of July 17
and the other last Friday night. On the
same night In July of the fire at Fort
Hamilton there was a disastrous fire at
Fort Wadsworth. The latest fire was at
Fort Slocum, on Davis Island, in the
sound, on Sunday night. \u0084
In each case there have been suspicious
circumstances concerning the origin of
the fires. Magazines, barracks, hospitals,
forage anu even big siege guns have been
destroyed and damaged in these fires,
and despite the most thorough investiga
tion nothing is known definitely as to how
the 3res started.
The officers in command of Fort Blocum
regard the fire there on Sunday night as
so suspicious that a court of inquiry has
been ordered to make an investigation. *
It is likely that an effort will be made
by the commanding officer of the Depart
of the East, General Fred D. Grant, to
see whether the fires In the three forts
had any connection or resulted from a
prearranged plan.

EXCUSE NOT ADEQUATE
Skipper to Suffer for De
clining to Assist Sylph
Off North Carolina Coast
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19.â The . fail
ure of Captain , WV HJiHotville,', as mas
ter of thejUnlted! Fruit Company's ship
Oteri, to give assistance to; the" United
States steamship Sylph, whictrwas dis
abled off the coast of .North Carolina
on the night; of April; 12, has cost him
his position by the revocation -of : his
license by the United States ; steamboat
inspection service. ,\u25a0 This 'action v was
taken by the inspection officers of Nor
folk, Va., on September 15, and the cor
respondence was made public ' to-day
by the Department of Commerce and
Labor. The Sylph was disabled while
Lieutenant Evans was .bringing ..;. the
vessel up the coast from Florida; where
it had been used by Mrs. Roosevelt and
her children for, a cruise. - ' >-; V '
Lieutenant Evans details the acci
dent to the Sylph and his failure to get
the Oteri to answer his signal of dis
tress and ; says; he was entirely "help
less and the Oteri 1 knew it." ; He then
graphically describes the happenings of
the night; the failure of v the other
steamships to see the signals of the
Sylph, and finally i the rescue on the
morning of the -16th by the Morgan
liner El Cid, which put about from her
course to New Orleans.
The morning had broken with the
weather wet and with a falling barom
eter and an increasing sea. Lieutenant
Evans asked to be towed to a V safe
anchorage In Chesapeake Bay, and the
request was complied with. .The~ Sylph
was taken in tow. The condition of the
Sylph 1 was so bad' that the'
liner was compelled to slow down from
"ten to five knots and later three knots
an hour. The report of Lieutenant
Evans closed with this statement: .
"I am firmly convinced that had not
the El Cld taken us Into port the Sylph
and all her passengers must 1 have been
lost"
The Inquiry adduced the fact that
Captain Hotville refused-- to slow^ down
for the alleged reason that at the time
the Sylph was spoken the telegraph
system on' the Oteri became impaired
and there was \u25a0no direct manner - of
sending word to the engine-room for a
reversal of the , engines. The Inspectors
held that this excuse showed the mas
ter to be a man without resources and
on that account revoked his license.

Just; as the Government ships are : to
be , withdrawn < from | the : trade new*
comes that foreign ships, - . operating
particularly ; from Â« Hongkong, ' have
made a; rate from that port to the four
principal ports of entry in the Philip
pines for foreign vessels-^Manila,llio
lo, Cebu and Zamboangaâ which is I less
than the lnterisland rate j between these
ports. The result of this rate.ltisi ex
pected, will be to divert: the -commerce
between " these ports to I Hongkong fat
the I expense of Manila; that - merchants
in '"these cities will purchase their: sup

'-There Is reason to believe that the

tion of the Philippines --has increased
the cost of operating ships restricted
to ' the regulations *of coastwise laws

STATE'S MONEY
FOR GAMBLERS
Governor of Indiana Tells
, >Vhy He Compelled Aud
itor Sherrick to Eesign
. " MILTON, : Ind.V Sept. IÂ».â ln an address
at the reunion iof the ] Thirtieth Indiana
Regiment, Governor Hanley, the principal
speaker, made public his reasons for. his
action in the case of ' David B. Sherrick,
iex-Audltor of State.*, whose â¢ resignation
.was \ forced ' by j the i Oovernor. " Facts " and
figures were J used to ? show \u25a0 what became
of the money belonging to the State that
,was ; lost by ; "David \B. Sherrtck, Auditor
of State," a common gambler." : : "-"
"The Governor charged that 910,000 of the
State's ' money /'went : by check â¢ into 1 the
hands of the 'gentleman who '.\u25a0/was ? then
operating the Casino at French Lick.' The
Governor .then enumerated a list of what
he called" "wildcat* speculations," aggre
gating face value of J75,000," into which the
State's .: money; went. ' He - charged- that
Sherrlck's continued absence from?;, the
sessions jof the ] State . Board ' of .Tax Com
missioners ': ''was occasioned by drinking
bouts and midnight carousals around I the
gaming â¢; table,, from which :he could â¢ not
recover" In time* to \u25a0 meet: with; the com
mission/ \u25a0''. ;: 1
He charged that Sherrick,' at the time the
Monon' Railroad came up j for assessment,
.urged that 'the assessment be allowed to
remain at $18,000, because, in that case, a
friend of his," to whom he was ' under great
obligation . personally, could - get perma
nent employment with the company. The
Governor continued : ; \u25a0* '\u25a0
; Before ".; my.. Inauguration [\u25a0 I . received':'trust
worthy information. that- he had written to thÂ«
management -of several * railroad . companies la
the month .of \u25a0\u25a0 December, \u25a0 1004, - over his own
signature as Auditor. of State, asking them to
send | small , passes Intended for. members of the
General -/Assembly, ' \u25a0 then about " to - convene,
stating |In I substance , that . he ' expected to \u25a0 have
some : legislation of personal ' interest to himself
before, that body,, and' ll they would' send their
transportation ; to \u25a0 \ him :\ for . . he
would - see i that their Interests \u25a0 and i his ~' werÂ«
cared I for . at \u25a0 the same : time.' : \u25a0 For ; three weeks
the office! of the Auditor of State waa made a
broker's v office for , the . distribution of free
passes ' to such 5 members ' of j. tho -. General As
sembly as would ..receive ' them.' â¢ â¢ -
'..'â¢ On . the \u25a0 evenine of ' the ' 30th of September . I
was ,\u25a0 informed sby I one .who had . been aiding
him,' \u25a0 and , in ? whom . I . hn ye confidence. / that \u25a0he
could not make payment; on the 15th. I then
pent him a verbal -demand for his immediate
resignation. . . The next morning his resignation,
did not come, but some of his friends did cam*
and > Informed ;: me 2 that ? the ' money could .' be
raised only upon condition that 'the 'defalcation
be kept a secret and that, he retain, his of floe.'
Upon Inquiry: I learned . that some of - the men
who. were to furnish .the money.. were the . rep
resentatives - of ; large railroad interests : In the

depending: upon them and, that their assistance

The story as it stands is in.no way

an interview with an unnamed "finan

supposed failure of Schwab and -other
Americans to secure the "order, declared
that the United States-could not pro
vide a new navy^except at , prohibitive
cost â perhaps 50 per cent more than tho
cost in Great Britain. He added that
he believed that the rumor waa true,

GOVERNOR FOLK ON CIVICS.
THE reception to Governor Folk of /Missquri furnished the op
portunity for saying many things of apt application to local
conditions. One great truth ran through it all. The majority of
the people in cities want them to be well governed, and they will be
well governed when this majority gets together for that purpose
alone. The members of this majority differ on the issues of national
politics. They differ about municipal ownership. They differ about
a multitude of things, and when these differences keep them apart
the ) minority, which agrees upon government for graft, standing
stoutly together, wins by a plurality and proceeds to use its power
for the purpose which unites it.
\u25a0Now who is to blame? At first we say, "the united grafters."
They ought not to be grafters. They ought to be good citizens.
They ought to use their power for good government. But they arc
grafters. They are not good citizens. They will not use their
power for good government. This is known to the upright ma
jority. That majority knows that the united grafters will graft;
misuse their power, corrupt the government and divert it to crim
inal gains for themselves. The majority has itself to blame for split
ting into two minorities and giving the grafters a plurality. .
All that was clearly put by Governor Folk, as it' has been put
time and again by The' Call. The Governor said, truly: "He who
lives for his country may be as true a patriot* as he who dies for it.
Patriotism does not abide alone in the roar of cannon and. in the
din and clash of arms, but in the everyday duties of civic life.
There may be as much patriotism in the ballot as in the bullet. The
patriotism of peace is even more necessary than the patriotism of
war, for history shows that where one government has been de
stroyed by wars, pestilence and all other calamities combined, cor
ruption has undermined a score. When good citizens disregard their
obligations to their country they leave its control to undesirable
elements."
The Mayor sought to place himself on the Governor's platform
by intimating that he is a martyr to the enmity of "corrupt editors."
But the Grand Jury was not made up of editors. It and not the
newspapers indicted his followers for ballot-box stuffing. A petit
jury, that was independent of the press, convicted them and an
independent Judge sentenced them to the penitentiary. Tf a man
is known by the company he keeps, no one need experience any
difficulty in* distinguishing the Mayor of San Francisco ' from the
Governor of Missouri.
The reception had in it two distinct features. It was official
and it was personal. The Governor of California was there, known
to stand for pure civics. The Mayor was there, and where he stands
is known. Mr. Gavin McNab was there, speaking for the union of
the majority on the single plank of decent government, and Gov
ernor Folk gave him special recognition for his encouragement of
the campaign for decency in Missouri. Mr. McNab said: "The
solution of the problem lies with the people alone. The citizens who
stayiavvay from the polls are otherwise the best. It is harder to
get men to vote at all than to get them to vote right. I believe there
should be a law to fine those who neglect their civic duty. They
should be punished for contempt of country. The boss is a man
who capitalizes the good citizens' neglect of duty and pays dividends
upon it at public expense."
These utterances tell the whole story. There is needed a re
vival of the civic conscience and of "civic patriotism.' >So wide is the"
difference between municipal and general government that the poli
tics of one cannot be the politics of the other; Party organizations
are useful in municipal government as organizations only, and not
because of their special opinions upon national issues: This has
come at last to be recognized in San Francisco, and the party or
ganizations seem to be girded up to their duty of uniting in order/
that the municipal government may be. rescued from graft ; and
greed. The appearance here of Governor Folk -was timely. It im
mediately preceded the final act of the reform movement .which
began wh^n Fairfax Wheelan arrested the ballot-box stutters. That
seemed a small beginning. It was the act of one man, bravely going
forth to fight against many, and to resis^ every effort of official
power to defeat his purpose of punishing the guilty. The great con
vention that is nominating the candidates chosen to carry the ban
ner of reform will he inspired and encouraged, and all citizens who
seek to crown their city with the graces and decencies of good gov
ernment will feel admonished to do their duty.
It was noticed that at the reception the names of stout war
riors for good -government, Roosevelt, Folk, Weaver and Jerome,
were cheered impartially, regardless of their views on national poli
tics. We seem to be at the dawn of a time in which city politics
shall be for cities, and when States and the nation will have politics
of an entirely different kind. 'In such a time virtue will lead-Ameri
can cities to the heights of cleanness, decency and sanity.
ENCOURAGE LOCAL ENTERPRISE.
THERE is no logical reason why the Street Committee of the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors should hesitate to report
favorably on the Ocean Shore Electric Railway Company's ap
plication for right of way and terminal privileges in this city. No
public protest has been entered against the granting of the proposed
franchise, nor, as far as is known by the projectors of the enterprise,
has any private interest filed objection. Indeed, it seems impossible
to find tenable ground for any opposition that would find popular
approval, for the strongest phase of the project consists of the, fact
tiiat its chief beneficiaries will be the masses.
California capitalto the amount of $5,000,000 is invested in the
construction and development of a trolley line extending from San
Francisco to Santa Cruz and traversing a territory rich in undevel
oped natural resources. Every dollar of this money is to be spent
and earned by Californians in the upbuilding of a portion of Cali
fornia whose material advancement has been delayed, by want of
proper facilities for the transportation of its products. From the
day construction of the road is commenced until it is in operation
$250,000 a month will be expended in wages and purchase of
materials, and it would be needless to elucidate how, San Francisco
will reap advantage from the outlay. When work is commenced at
this end of the line 1500 1 men will be kept steadily employed for at
least a year. Their earnings will, of course,' be spent here.
Looking still farther forward it is easy to perceive how this
city would be benefited by the opening up of a country that is nat
urally tributary to it. By establishing faster speed\ and; cheaper
fares than now exist between San Francisco .and Santa Cruz the
Ocean Shore Company aims to populate the intervening couhtry,'. at
present sparsely settled, with 'desirable , home-builders, an*dto be a
means of instituting new and important industries. The strip be
tween mountains and sea is rich in timber and minerals, and 177,000
arable acres await tilling. Even in its backward state last year the
country sent out 77,000 tons of freight by wagon roads and water.
4 With the foregoing facts andmany others to commend encour
agement of the Ocean Shore undertaking, by San Francisco n the
Street Committee of the Supervisors rriay Yeasonably-be expected to
report favorably on the petition for a: franchise, at their meeting to
day. The ninety days' limit for acting; on the petition will expire
with t,he 26th of this month, so any further delay fin granting it
would be dangerous. To permit such an unquestionably meritorious
enterprise to suffer by legislative neglect would? serve; to discourage
the inauguration of similar projects. Local capital has often be'en
censured for its timidity.' Kpw is the time to stimulate its invest
ment by placing every legitimate facility at command ; of the 'Ocean
Shore Electric Railway Company-

Dorothy Fenimore
HAVE*you ever taken note of that
typp of individual' who likes to
v . use his friends as blotters;. whoso'
mind, whenever V'it comes In contact'
with other minds, thereby makes its
own writing: clear," but leaves a blurred
and^unsig'htlyimpresslon on the other?
There; are Innumerable -varieties and
modifications' of 'the type. * You dis
tinguish In what ; class they belong, by
the.fact that so often j-ou find yourself
changed;for,the" worse,- when they are
through^with you. ... %
There is 'the woman who shops' with
j'ou all . the ' forenoon \u25a0in order 'â¢ to come
ilnally.' to a decision *"to; buy the. first
piece^of. dress -goods she looked at.
There is the man who establishes his
own [ first Judgment in a business deal
; by gaining 'your advice to follow ex
actly^ the -opposite course to the* one
whichsuits him: . ~- >. -
There is the person for whom a good
row clears- the air; if only it sours the
milk of, human "kindness In, everybody.
else about. .There is the. miserable
wretch who is forever lightening his
heart by shifting its burden on. yours,
but ne\-er taking a single practical step
toward easing his sad situation. '
It Is the easiest thlngf in the world
for a sympathetic person to become a
blotter. ; A little. overstrain, \ excess of
fatigue, a nervous Jar. .will take the
sizing out of a man's mental constitu
tion in the twinkling of an eye. \u25a0. It
doesn't matter so much until he accu
mulates so many impressions of .'other
people's woes that the ink of them is
ready, to rub off on all it touches.
What then? Of what use on earth is a
used-up 1 blotter?/ . ;
This points a double moral: Don't
use your friends :as blotters, and refuse
yourself to be one.
.The world is . made up, I have ob
served, of health-givers and health
takers. If you are the former you at
tract ' 'troubles as a magnet draws
needles. . \u25a0 Probably it Is part of . the
Big Plan that this shoufd be so. But
it ; is : appallingly easy to become de
magnetized-^-to degenerate into that
other species, the health-taker.
Remember thisâ -you j can't? help the
world except out of your reserve. De
plete your. own vital force of.personal
ity, and you rob the social life of which
you are a member. You may share
your, material poverty/with a beggar,
and in so d^Jng, perform a worthy act,
if you have 'the stamina make your
loss good and save .yourself from pau
perism. 'But it helps nb-man. no mat
ter how poor he is. spiritually, to give
him out of I your^-soul's poverty; ; you
must give to him of its riches.- ,\.
And don't forget this: When a man
is warbling about his woes he doesn't
need you to comfort'him; he. has â¢ the
sound of his own^voice to cheer him.
Nor do tears express the "heart's deep
agony; that is ice-rbound and mute.
One who can weep '; ls on' the softer,
warmer side of sorrow.
Pity, the weak, j You can't help it, for
they are pitiable. Help 'them as much
as you can without overstraining your
muscle. "But -save your' handclasp f>pf
genuine sympathy,. -and your word fof
encouragement, for,' him who | fights his
way through the night with forehead
high and colors flying, asking no mercy
where mercy' is not, /protesting not
where protest is futile, but simply
fighting and hoping. To make it really
count to him, however, you have got to
be somewhere near his level. You
can't be a poor. 111-used, defaced human

7"he Dowieltes who arrived here from
Auckland. New Zealand, on tne steam
ship Sierra and were detained on board
by the United States Immigrant In
spectors were allowed to land after a
rebearJng yesterday afternoon. The
party consists of William F. Smith, a
civil engineer; his wife and three chil
dren; James Todd, a laborer, and Miss
Kate Hawthorne, a house servant.
They came from Auckland under prom
ice of employment at Zion City and
-were held by the authorities on the
ground they were contract laborers.
In the case of Patrick Coyle, his wife
and five children, ranging from one to
fifteen years, permission to land was
granted after a rehearing by the Fed
eral authorities yesterday afternoon^
The family arrived on the Sierra and
were denied landing on the grounds
that both the father and mother were
deaf and likely to become public
charges.
A daughter Sophie, aged nine years,
is suffering from inflammation of the
eyelids and turning in of the eye
lashes to such an extent that an oper
ation is considered necessary. The
family proved they had many friends
in the city, among whom was Rev. M.
J. Casey, of St. Mary's Cathedral, who
took such an interest in them as to se
cure permission for them to land.
George Maxwell, a custom officer at
Vancouver, left for that city yesterday
alter an agreement between the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company and the
Oceanic Steamship Company that in
case he were denied landing by the au
thorities the latter company would re
turn him to Australia. Maxwell's case
is a peculiar one. He left Vancouver
to spend his vacation in Australia and
on his return asked the privilege of
landing here in transit to his home. He
was denied landing, as the doctors say
he has trachoma and the immigrant of
ficials .are of the opinion that he will
be denied landing in Vancouver also
on that account. He is a British sub
ject, but not a Canadian subject.
EXHIBITS PICTURES
OF THE HOLY LAND
Father 3lulligan Takes Part
at St. Joseph's Fair
Benefit.
A delightful entertainment, including
Etereoptlcon views of the Holy Land by
th* Rev. Father P. E. Mulligan, was
given last night for the benefit of St.
Joseph/s fair in St. Joseph's Hall. In
his opening remarks Father Mulligan said
that a visit to the Holy Land disillusioned
the traveler of many of the romantic
ideas formed as to the beauties of the
place. Still, he said, to the eyes of faith
the Holy City is still beautiful, notwith
standing the devastations that have gone
on there.
The scenes thrown on the screen began
from the landing at Jaffa, through the
plain of Sharon to Jerusalem and then
from Hebron through Bethlehem to the
Holy City. The various parts of histori
cal interest Jn the city were the Church
of thf Holy Sepulchre, the Pretorium and
the MosQue of Omar. *i
Along with the historical scenes were
rriiglous pictures typifying Biblical
events; Subjects taken by Father Mulli
gan himself while in the Holy Land were
appropriately portrayed by moving pic
tures, j '

Miss Claribel Freeman, youthful and
dusky, told Police Judge Mogan that
George B. Washington "did pufflckly
right", when he smote the head of Robert
Willibert Jones with a 44-caliber revolver,
because Mr. Jones had not only "made
hlsself 'tensive" to her, but slapped the
face of Mr. Washington's better-half.
Moreover, Jhe impudence Bhown by Mr.
Jones in causing the arrest of Mr. Wash
ington on a charge of battery was consis
tent with his preceding behavior, which
exceeded anything in the line of "fresh
ness" that Miss Freeman had ever heard
of. much less observed.
"Dis yah Jones man," Miss Freeman
elucidated, "is eh ba-bah at V'leb. en

"How did Mrs. Washington . expostu

"Didn't she attack him with a broom

"No, sah; nuffin ob de soht," wag the
emphatic answer. ."She jes sez teh 'lm

"What did she mean by that?" queried
the attorney.
"Wot wud she mean by et but dat she

"No, sah; 'c didn't git, but stuck 'roun'

recklessly prevaricated. "Ah'H tek oath,

LAME EXCUSES
ARE OFFERED
]*ortland Exposition Rep
resentatives Shift Blame
for the -Cheap Prizes
KERBIGAX ? S POSITION
Director of Athletics Says
lie Permitted Men to Be
lieve Trophies Valuable
PORTLAND, Sept. 13.â Athletes from
various sections of the United States
who competed in the Lewis and Clark
championships given under the .au
spices of the Lewis and Clark Kxposi
tion and who imagined that for win
ning first place they received gold
medals valued at $22 50 are just awak
ening to the fact that the medals are
gold-plated affairs valued at from $5
to $12 50, though there were a few
of the higher-priced medals cast.
The first complaint that some of the
prize-winners were displeased ''with the
treatment accorded them by the ex
position officials was received from
San Francisco in a letter addressed to
Bert Kerrigan, director of athletics at
the exposition, by Eugene Van Court
of the Olympic Club. of San Francisco,
who protested against the small in
trinsic value of the medals .won by
several of the champion athletes of
that club.
.When seen to-day Mr. Kerrigan ad
mitted he had permitted the impres
sion to get out among the' competing
athletes that the medals were of gold
and valued at $22 50 for the first
medals and \u25a0 down to $15 for the less
meritorious testimonials. Kerrigan
claims he never made the direct state
ment that the men were competing for
gold medals, but simply permitted the
men to believe they were contesting
for really valuable prizes.
In order to protect himself from
scandal, the manufacturing jeweler ex
plained to-day that he had never rep
resented the medals to be anything
more than "they were â gold-plated on
copper. He also showed his accounts,
which make it plain that several hun
dred medals were ordered by the Lewis
and Clark Exposition management and
that J.he prices were from 'ss to $12 50
each.
The firSt story regarding the quality
of the medals was given publicity in
the Call. It attracted widespread at
tention, as athletes from New York and
from the Middle West had competed at
Portland. The exposition officials do
not offer to make good the value of the
medals. \u25a0 .
FOOTBALL AT STANFORD.
First Contest of the Si-aunn la Sched
uled for To-Day. -
STANFORD UNrV'EBSITY, Sept. 19.
The freshmen football squad â¢will line
\u25a0up to-morrow for the first actual con
test of the season, when they meet the
eleven from the Berkeley High School.
The "prep" school players are reputed
to know the game and are nearly as
heavy as the university youngsters.
The game will be rather a scrimmage
practice than a struggle for victory,
from the standpoint of Coach Lanagan.
There are some seventy . players who
are eligible to play on the '09 team,
and all of these aspirants as far as is
feasible will be given a chance to show
their mettle. Â»/ ,
The lads from tnÂ« s rival college town
high school will line up as follows:
Fullback, Peck; right half, 1 Thomas;
quarter-back. Miller; left half, Watts;
center, Doane; right guard, Steams;
left guard. Bowman and Nance; , left
tackle, Solinsky; right tackle, llerritt
and Stubt; right end, McKuily and
Barnett; left end, Steele and New
comb.

By, bunching six hits iff the fourth
inning yesterday afternoon at Idora
Park Portland chased four men in suc
cession across j the \u25a0 pan and | broke '\u25a0 up
the i game, sending the Commuters \' a
step down the ladder. , Oakland started
in the first as'if determined to take
the game,, offhand, and the
spasm was over one man had made the
circuit. \
The Webfooters, however, had am
ple revenge, in their, half tff the second
inning, doubling Oakland's score.' That
did them no good, for the Commuters,
aided by j two | hits, a man j hit by the
.pitcher and an error by Portland's
catcher, tallied three men, making the
score four to two. Then, came the fatal
fourth. -..Blexrud went up, inf the air
and was hit all over the. lot. Schfafley.
led the procession 'with a three-bagger
and was scored; by JVlcLean. Hit fol
lowed hit, and before, the slaughter was
over Portland had scored four runs.
In the next inning. Graham' replaced
Blexrud, but it: was. too' late for -; the
Commuters to . retrieve ; the game. â¢> In
the seventh Portland secured another
tally/ This, ended the run-getting for
the game.":. Oakland had an' excellent,
chance *to do ; something -in' the ninth,
but was not equal to -the task. The

POOE JUDGE OF PRICE
Thinks the Battler Should
Have Entered the Ring
Public Choice at Colma
Manager Billy Nolan seems under th*
spell of an unlucky star theoÂ« day*.
In addition to his Sacramento ! Grand
Jury troubles and his Justice's Court
suits he has had his pet wager decided
against him.
Some weeks since ha bet Judge Hor
ace H. Egbert of the New California
Jockey Club $100 even that when Brltt
and Nelson entered the ring at Colma
on September 8 the Dane would bÂ«.thÂ«
public favorite in the betting.
When Referee Graney declared bet*
off Nolan refused to pay his wager, al
though sporting men throughout Amer
ica held that Graney*s ruling applied
only to the result of the actual contest.
The Egbert-Nolan bet stood as would a
bet on the attendance.
Harry Corbett, who held tho money,
ruled in -Egbert's favor. Nolan insisted
on the matter being referred to Georg*
Slier of Chicago. The latter decided
yesterday that the referee's ruling doss
not cover the case in question and
awards the coin to Egbert.

The Kcsxnos liner Memphis, Captain
Yon Helms, arrived yesterday afternoon
.from Hamburg by way of South and
Central American ports. She had a -clean
bill of health from all ports of call, there
was no sickness on board and the Federal
ii'ithcrities gave her quick dispatch
through quarantine. The Memphis is the
first vessel from the southern coast for
many months that has not been sent to
Angel Island to Le fumigated.
The Memphis brought 2400 tons of car
go and twenty-one passengers. No acci
dents marred the trip and tine weather
was encountered throughout the long
voyage. Captain Yon Helms is related to
bar pilot Yon Helms of this port and to
Captain Nopander of the steamship Uma
tilla.
The Memphis' passengers included ' the
following: " *

Changes on Liner Manchuria.
The Pacllic Mail Company will probabiy
:. ._*â¢- many changes of officers on the liner
Manchuria before the starts again across the
Pacific. R. P. Schwerin has taken a special
pride in the company's lour big ships, and
a: fleers and men. have beÂ«n picked because
they were thought to possess the Qualifications
r.ic-ssary for the smooth running of the com
plex affairs of a floating hotel. In the cases
tr the Mongolia, Korea, and Siberia results
have justified the general manager's judgment.
iSchwerin fell down, however, on the Manchu
ria. She has been a source of trouble from
the first. On her last two voyages she has
brought home many bitter complaints from
passengers. Passengers who arrived here the
other day. and who made the round trip on
the liner. *ay that on the outward voyage,
thanks to the presence en board of the Taft
party, even thing was lovely, but that, on the
homeward voyage scant courtesy was shown
to any of the. passengers. As- a result of these
complaints It is understood there will be
f weeping changes in the purser's and stew
ard's deparunents, and that when the liner
go*>s t 0 sea It will be with a. new purser and a
nrw steward. Chief Officer Morton was in
jured the day -the liner arrived and will re
main ashore for awhile. The hand that oper-
Utta the Pacific Mail guillotine is getting ready
to harvest a backet of heads from the Man
churia, and in the unrest that now reigns
on board there may be come satisfaction for
the passeri(r?TS who Buffered from Indifferent

IS VICTORIOUS
University Freshmen Defeat
Oakland Eleven Decis
ively on the' Gridiron
\u25a0NEW RULE FOR EOOTERS
Coach Knibbs Requests the
Students to Refrain From
Discussing the Game
BERKELEY, Sept. 19.â The freshman
football team of the State University de
feated * with i the i . utmost ease to-day tha
eleven from the Oakland High School, .the
score at the end oÂ£ play standing IS- to 0.
The freshmen, twlce^fmada ; a touchdown
and twice kicked a goal |in the first half,
and .contented themselves ;,wlth j a touch
down and a goal in ! the second half. They
bucked the high school's line at will, and
showed great superiority to i the visiting
lads at every stage "of the game. , ; >
, The; Oaklanders were a crippled aggre
gation,"^; however. They played the Cen-;
terville. aggregation . last ' Saturday and;
several of : their , best men were injured in
that con test, so that the â¢ freshmen S found
opposing them'; a weakened- teaml \ . ': '.[ f ' : \
. Captain Jim ; Force of the.yarsity team
acted as referee.' 'He was'not enthusiastic
over the work of the freshmen, despite
their easy victory.' appearing to believe,
their form .was not at all satisfactory.
The line-up: .
Freshmen â Sneil, fullback; Stanton, right
half; Cerf, ; left half; Shafer, quarter; G. John
son, right end; O'Connor, left end; Cunha, left
tackle; Miller, : right: tacxte; R. Johnson, left
guard; Fiske, ' right guard; Sproule, center. '
Oakland â Yon Loben Sels. fullback; StroudU
right half; R. Walton, left half; E. N. Walton. 1
quarter; Malcolm, right end; Spangler, left
end; Kutz. left tackle; Maiden, right tackle;:
Harris, left guard; Davis, right guard; Ralph,'
center. \u25a0;:.. : - . . . > \
Coach Knibbs has handed out a . new,
wrinkle, through . Captain Force, to- the
university students. To the rooters, f'Cap-;
tain Force has . expressed the wish of .the
coach, that students refrain from discuss
ing football with the players. Hitherto,
football has been the all-absorbing topic
for discussion before the big game, when
ever a member (of the squad was met by,
students. It is understood the coaches be-)
lieve the men get "keyed up" too much'
when there is a great deal of football talk
and that they will be better off if in-!
duced to discuss books, studies, social af-'"
falrs-^ariy thing but football. .-. , ]

Voices of Wonderful Singers
% Stir the Vast Audience
to Highest Enthusiasm
"Luclaa" like last nlgfht'3 at the Tlvon
and we shall soon be sending East mora
than a Tetrazzlni. We are not Inviting in
junctions here Just now. but Mr. Conn^
might do much worse than present Mr.
Coppola to the metropolis. As Edgardo,
Coppola'.last nlarht developed delightfully
and Polacco's destination seems Inevit
able, every performance only more surely
pointing the way. Possibly the last re
pose is yet wanting In his achievement,
possibly a shade of charity to the singer,
but Polacco's seem the attest shoulders
yet for the Mandnelll mantle. -\u0084 '^jjj
Altogether it was one of the bright par
ticular performances last night. One ol
the standeesâ there was a thick fringe oÂ£
themâ put it that "it made you forget that
you were standing." Many things it mada
one forget, everything, in that victorious
moment of the sextet, saev that "God" a
in his heaven, all's right with the world:"
"Honest to goodness," as Kose Stahl
says In -"The Chorus Lady," the price of
it makes one feel like a pirate. Tetraz- ,
zini they gave you, Coppola, the Tlvoli
Saleza. Dado, than whom no better Ray
mondo Is needed. Gregorettl as Henry
Ashton, a brilliant chorus, an admlrabU
orchestra, Polacco, all . for 50 cents up.
And that it Is what the people want they
showed by? coming until the big. hospit
able TtvotV could hold no more of them.
Tetrazzini was "in fine form on thÂ»
whole, though; not at quite her best. Her
"mad scene" "was as usual beautifully
done,* and vociferously applauded, and a
few measures repeated. Beautifully in
deed, again went some of the ensembl*
work between Tetrazzini and Coppola,
the two voices a miraculous blend. It
was doubtless the temperamental gifts
of Tetrazzini that inspired the tenor with
the aplomb that he brought to the Ed
gardo and that was so markedly lacking
in his Dcs Grieuxin the "Manon Le*
caunt." And there Is still more of self-con
fidence needed by this admirable artist.
One beard with new delight the exquislt*
enunciation, the perfectly delivered note,
sweet, vibrant, distinguished, of this lat
est of the Tlvoli discoveries. Vocally.
Coppola Is absolutely to "be depended,
upon, and his Edgardo after hia Dt;*j(
Grieux was an agreeable surprise botb:_
from the dramatic and picturesque s.de.
Gregoretti was more himself last night
part'of last nightâ than I have so far
heard him this season. But not yet quite
the bid GregorettL And yet at -moments
more than the old GregorettL Quite \u25a0
sharp, from a certain nervousness, was
his pitch in the whole first act, and in
the beginning of the sextet even, a
little rhythmic hesitancy, as in other
places, was felt. Again, as in the second
act in the duet between Henry and Lucia,
Gregoretti's* - artistry and noble voice
were in best evidence. Dado was a gor
geous Raymondoâ if you know a better
word, use "It.*
It Is not to be forgotten that Mme. Tet
razzlni's gowns by are in the cast, and
that there Is a real fountain In Lucia's
garden thrown In. ""~" --â-'â\u25a0?? â ,t*^^~^~~. â - -_..

There Is no hesitation in saying that it
has never been done better In San Fran

to select a cast anywhere that would
do better justice to it than the one now
bringing out Its good points for thu
Majestic Theater, audiences. The stag
ing: Is excellent. One of the scenes
brings forth - applause because it is
picturesque. James XeiTl as Colonel
ivloberly does the part to perfection.

Robert Wayne does well with the rola
of Captain Davenport and Underwob<l

Wilson as Raymond Page and Ravolo
as Decatur are well fitted to the char
acters' they assume. Little' France*
Slosson as. Carey Preston Is charmln<
and has an ingenuous stage presence.
The part of Mrs.' Page is exploited by
Edythe Chapman Neill for all that It 1?
worth and' is by all odds the star part
of the cast on the women's side of- tho
house. Miss 'lleason and Marie Gordon
are also in the cast.
The Majestic ~ quartet sing plantation'

Â»*Â«\u25bc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 19.â 1t has been assumed
for feme time past that anxiety over the money
outlook was the sole ' restraining S influence
against -speculative advances in stocks, the
general brightness cf the Industrial situation
serving to cause . a chafing against this re
straint In present prof esslonal operators of all
classes." The interesting - developments in the
money market to-day were distinctly a re
laxing of tension, but this did. not prevent In
terest In stocks, the tendency of prices
toward a lower level. The technical condition
of the market after .last ireek'a considerable
advance,* which . was made In the face of ad
monitory p!Â«adtngs on. the part of a large cle
ment In ' Wall street, might be held account
able ' for the reaction \u25a0In Itself. -There were
some factors of a positive - nature . against the
market. â¢ On the c!d>-of--ihe taoney situation
the most disappointment . was the . expression
of the oYficiaU of -the Bank, of France 'and
other Parts bankers "contained In a cable to the
Associated Press :iaÂ«t night en the prospects of
a gold movement to New,. York. :It was dls-
( closed that the Paris' banking -q-grid would
'*^tard " a surrender . of gold by â¢ the Bask of
./JHctnce for shipment to New â¢ York with en
tlr- equanimity. The impression which hai
rrown in New Tork that the forthcoming ' Rus
sian loan ''would prompt the placing of obstacles
to tlie withdrawal- of cold from ParU is 4lÂ«-
pelled by : this expression of opinion on . the
part of the \u25a0 Paris ! bankers. " The news of the,
engagfiment of $1,650,000 of gold for shipment
to NÂ«w York contained In the Paris dispatch
was confirmed to-day. The withdrawals up to
this time are all from the London \u25a0 market. â¢ As
a consequence there has been a further
advance in the Bank of England rate
and Interest centers In the New . York
demand from London â¢ to Paris. This
prospect unsettled the London market. \ The
recall of the â¢ crisis regarding affairs In Mo
rocco was another disturbing influence in for
eign markets. The volume ot selling for for
eign account was heavy and this . played no
small' part In the market. -Pension payments
and purchase of foregln exchange by the Post
office Department are the special items of the
Treasury Department's demands. â¢ The pros
pects of the money market were brightened.:
Bonds were heavy. Total sales, par value,
$3,160,000. ' â¢' â¢' , \u0084 - .
United Etates bonds were all unchanged on

tions showed slight losÃes, December /being off
a shade to %SV*c at 63%@84c. The principal
: factor contributing to the easier tone was Con
tinued marketward movement .â¢ of 'enormous
quantities; of new wheat in .the Northwest.
Notwithstanding additional j rains throughout
the greater poftibn .of the spring wheat bell
arrivals -to-day" at ' Minneapolis, and
totaled 1033 cars. -At \u25a0 Winnipeg also reoojts
showed tin Increase. It was reported that: the t
\u25a0 movement would be. much greater but for thÂ«
Inability of the railway companies to . furnish
' sufficient cars". ':.', Lower -prices for: wheat/ at

here. v For a > time > the -. market X had r thef aaÂ«

PLAN TO ANNEX
THE ALEXANDER
Crockers Considering Propo
sition to Make New Hotel
Part of the St. Francis
DEAL IS UNDER WAY
Owner of the Geary Street
Property Offers to Sell
Her Holdings for $450,000
The trustees of the Crocker estate are
considering a proposition, submitted to
them several weeks ago by Mrs. Golda
Alexander, to purchase the Hotel Alex
ander on Geary street, and make it an
annex of the St. Francis Hotel. The
matter waa discussed thoroughly at a
meeting of the trustees yesterday morn
ing, but Just what deolsion wu arrived
*t .was not announced.
The Hotel Alexander is an eleven-story
stone and brick structure that was fin
ished and opened only a few months ago.
It lias a frontage on Geary street of thir
ty-flve feet and is separated from the St.
Francis Hotel by. the News building,
which la owned by the Crocker heirs.
Mrs. Alexander's proposition to sell
waa made to the Crocker heirs after it
had been learned that the San Francisco
Hotel Company, the lessee of the St.
Francis Hotel, had expressed an inclina
tion to annex the building, with a view
of anticipating the heavy business that
the coming winter seas&n promiiea to
the hotels of this city.
ANTICIPATING 810 BI7SXXES3.
It way realized more than a year ago
toy the hotel company, as well as by the
Crocker estate, which owns a large block
of the hotel company etock, that the ca
pacity of the St. Francis is Inadequate
for the . Increasing hotel business and.lt
was this fact that prompted the Crocker
estate to build another wing to the big
hostelry. The latter will not be com
pleted until January, 1907, and poeslbly
later, which means that two winter sea
sons will pass before the rooms In the
addition will be earning a revenue.
The hotel company ha* figured that if
It could get the Hotel Alexander and con
nect it with the ,St. Francis by means of
a covered bridge across the News build
ing, it would assure the company an in
creased revenue. .The Alexander Is fur
nished on a plan similar to the St. Fran
cis and in fact ltc general Interior was
patterned after the bigger hotel. Mrs.
Alexander is said to have named $150,000
as her price and it is upon this figure
the trustees of the Crocker estate have
been considering the proposed deal.
HOTEL PEOPLE ARE HOPEFUL.
One of the Crocker people, discussing
the matter yesterday, said that while the
Crocker heirs appreciated the immediate
need of more room In the St. Francis Ho
tel and regarded Mrs. Alexander's propo
sition as one worthy of careful considera
tion, they had not fully determined wheth
er it would be advisable for them to in
crease their holdings in that neighbor
hood, especially aÂ£ it would only be' a
matter of two years before the new wing
of the St. Francis would be completed.
It is admitted that the directors of the
St. Francis Hotel are endeavoring to in
duce the Crocker estate to. acquire the
Hotel Alexander and have not yet given
up hope of accomplishing that purpose.
If the deal goes through it Is said that
the bridge across the News building will
be built immediately and that before
December 15 the Alexander will form part
of the St. Francis, giving the latter 300
additional and much needed apartments.
She Charge* Fraud.
Ma&?ie A. Harper filed suit yesterday
against Mary Howard and Hattle Mc-
L-eniran to recover $20,000 damages for
alleged conspiracy. The plaintiff says
that ehe was left property valued at
$20,000 by Ann Olbrecht In her last
Till, but that subsequently Sarah Bor
land produced what purported to be a
later will, excluding- the plaintiff as a
beneficiary, and that all of the defend
ants then falsely swore that the later
document was genuine. As . a result
the later document was admitted to
probate. The plaintiff says that In fact
the later will was fraudulent and that
â¢he has been damaged In the sum sued
for through the action of the defend
ants. t

ing a jury was immediately taken up and

plete. Those that will try the case are
Jacob Phillips. William Schilling, Samuel
M. Frank. John Higglns. John B. Greene.
Henry Wetren. Ernest Schmidt, -T. P.
Conlan, A. Lang, T. G. Williams, Max

Including Heller & Powers, Sidney M.
Ehrman. Garret W. McEnerney. Carter
P. Pomeroy. M. F. Michael, P.F. Dunne.
John J. Barrett, E. S. Pillsbury and. Oscar

outlined by counsel, follow:
The fÂ«.thÂ«r Â«nd mother of Samuel Da\'is were
Paul and Esther Bamabee Davis. They hid
Din* children, three sons and six daughters.
None or the children survived Samuel Davis,
who died April 6. 1904, except one sister, Jane
Davis, who died unmarried and childless Sep
tember 19, 1004. One brother and one sister
of Samuel Davis left descendants. The brother
was Henry Davis and the elster Marietta Davis
Henry Davis left a daughter, Mary Q. Btone,
still living; a son. Henry Davis Jr., who died

survived Samuel Davis. The four grandchil
dren are Edward C. French, George w.
French, William G. French and Samuel D.

vis left surviving him one elster. Jane Davis;
one niece Mary G. Stone; one nephew, Henry
Davis Jr*. and six grandnieces and grand
nephewsâHiram C. Davis, Sarah Louise Davis,
Edward C. French, George W. French, William

I hereby revoke all former willa made by me.
"SAMUEL DAVIS, 40S California street.;

all my clothes. - The remainder of my. property
I srlve to my nieces and nephews . and grand
nieces and . grandnephews share and share
alike . SAMUEL DAVIS."
If "the codicil -Is admitted to probate, cne
half of the Samuel Davis estate will go to the
estate of Jane Davis, as Indeed it will under
the will without the codicil. The other half
will go to the \u25a0 legatees named In the codicil
and then be divided between the nieces and.
nephews and grandnieces and grandnephews;
whereas, if the codicil Is not admitted to pro r
bate the half which does not go to the es-^
tatÂ« of Jane Davis will go In equal shares to
Mary G. Stone and the estate of her brother,

floating, in lslals Creek yesterday by, two
lumbermen. His legs were firmly fastened
with a â¢ bandana '] handkerchief 'and ; one of

The man had evidently made up his mind
to die and fastened his limbs so that he
could , not save himself. . >'
. At first the fact "of. his limbs being tied,
roused suspicions of foul play. A careful
examination of the manner in which they
were tied v proved ' conclusively that the
man had done the work himself. Lewis
had very little money at the time he_ dis-
appeared. ' . "" ; vâ

The shrieks brought a crowd
of angry Chinese" to ; the ; scene. Reyol

for. Wade, , when; the policemen arrived.
Chinamen came rushing up from all parts
of the.iquarter: and the three policemen'
had all they could do to get the constable*
and . the ; girl through I the ' mob. ' " ~ :V; \ ,"?
Sin Gook's friends and relatives declare
that she has; never; been:out ; of the/city
and that , the | charge of grand larceny |Is
trumped , up, to get the girl not of the
city. She is a 'beauty from the Celestial
point' of .view; and it is alleged that a
rich Chinese in I San Jose has become ln
fatuated ,with ; her and is â¢\u25a0 attempting to
obtain: possession* of her through the * aid
of the; constable. / :
As soon as Wade > arrived . he had the
warrant signed by -Judge Fritz and -ac
companied by a^ Chinaman named Wong
Sin, who, it is charged, is in ; the plot to
kidnap the girl, '-went to Baker alley.
Without consulting- the squad '.Wade at
tempted to : drag : the woman from her
home. \ His lif 5 was in jeopardy when the
policemen arrived. >
The, woman; was : taken to San Jose late
in the afternoon. She ; was. accompanied
by. several. of her relatives and Attorney
