SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 9.â The forest

seem dubious. The fire has now been
burning fifty-four hours and has de
stroyed over 8000 acres of brush and
fine timber. The flames are now mak
ing their way toward the Carson Gulch
and Camp Taylor. Efforts to back
fire are . fruitless, as the flames leap
many- feet and the hot cinders fly
across the clearings and start fresh
fires.
It is now feared that the flames will
reach the tracks of the North Shore

North Shore has sent a gang of men

to foresee thÂ© genius which inspired
the strategy of the Russian commander

ThÂ© Daily Telegraph, in commenting
on the account of the battle of Liao
yang, Bays it waa a struggle "terriblÂ©
beyond thÂ© imagination, with a des
peration unparalleled in war." "Hence
forth," it says, "a new standard of he
roism is set in war. Japanese and Rus
sians alike have shown capacity for
sacrifice, contempt for death and utter
abnegation of self. In answer to the su
preme demands of patriotism, which
have never yet been excelled."
The paper reads a lesson to the Eng
lish people, drawn from the battle,
which is to the effect that they must
be prepared to fight for existence to an
extent not even Indicated in the South
African war, "when the unprecedent
edly low rate of casualties was suffi
cient to induce the British armies to
abandon attack and acknowledge fail
ure. These lessons have already been
wiped out by the lessons of a far
greater war."

Sheriff Edward ' Bell to-day said that

"I have no details as to whether Ro

that before the strike he was a mem

about a /year* and a half ago, shortly
after having been released from the
Canon City Penitentiary, where he had
served a sentence for burglary." ; ;> ; '--c

HIS CONFESSION
FT. PETERSBURG. Sept. 9.â Thl5
evening's reports are to the effect that
â¢Kuroki has tackled Count Meinberg's
forces, and another Is that Kuropatkin
is wounded. Neither can be confirmed.
Rumor has it that the second Pacific
fquadron starts to-morrow. It is b#
lieved from good Â»ources that they
cannot get away until Monday at the
tariie8t. Owing to the important prob
ability of needing troops for the Â«le
iense of Vladivostok, it transpires that
General Linevitch eanno^ send the su
perior force called for by General Ku
ropatkin. This and other uncomfort
able reports flew through the Bourse
to-day with the effect that consols are
Â«'own to SI. .he lowest point reached
yet.
Business men fuMy realize that the
war is to be very prolonged, when hos
tiiitits even now are seriously affect
ing trade An instance is the Nijini
Novgorod fair, always reckoned a sure
barometer. It closed showing 25 per
< ent reduction in the volume of busi
ness, while of weightier import is the
announcement that not less than a.
million rubles ($500,000) worth of bilis
falling due have been protested.
The story of the inability of mer
chants to meet their obligations going
to the Novgorod fair was spread widely
over the country, and another issue of
4j.000.0M rubles ($20,000,000) notes is
announced. The enormous losses of
life recently have caused further call
on r*Â«erve forces, while all who vol
unteered are forthwith accepted.
Military men differ as to where the
next right is to bo. Some say und?r
th* wall of Mukden, others Tienling,
v.hile the Invalide iÂ« of the opinion that
the next battle will be fought in the
tpring at Harbin.
The meager reports published in the
foreign prers are not fully communi
cated to the Russian papers and for
three days practically no newspaper
dispatches have been coming through
from the front. Information may be
w;"' 'eld for strategic reasons, but the
public is disposed to regard it other
wife, resulting in the circulation of the
v.:!dest reports, some of the Russian
pftpCra tie ending in pretty outspoken
lafhisn reorganization of the condi
tions at the front and als<> demanding
that Geneial Kuropatkin be given un
tyammeled control as commander In
Â«:hiet. evidently aiming at Viceroy
Alexieff, who is supposed to be respon
sible tor insisting latterly that the re
inforcements should go to Vladivostok
in view of the probability of early
Japanese operations there or at Har
bin, thus depriving Kuropatkin of
_tr<xjps which would have turned the
fcalt; at Liaoyang. The Russ Is espe
cially bold considering the restrictions
placed nn the Russian press. It de
clares that numerical superiority is not
enough and that what is needed is some
of the do-or-die spirit of the Japanese.
The paper quotes the words of General
Dragomiroff, farmer Governor General
of Kieff. an authority on military mat
ters, as follows:
"Give me a soldier who is firmly de
termined to die for his country and I
will guarantee that my tactics will be
euperexellent. The man who will lay
dot% n his life is terrible. A bullet may
Flop such a man. but will not stop a
company. It is difficult to fight and
more difficult to vanquish them."
The Russ continues: "What we need
is an entirely new organization of
e\*erything connected directly or In
directly with the military operations.
A good deal is admirable but a good
deal also is deplorable. The fact that
things have not gone well at the
theater of war may be due to the fact
that everything is not directed with a
single aim, subservient to a single, un
divided wilL Kuropatkin, now en
trusted with the command of the Man
churian army, should be commander In
chief."
The following dispatch filed at Liba.u
hes been received from the captain of
the Russian cruiser Ural:
"Have just returned from a thirty
days' expedition raiding the enemy's
contraband on the Spanish coast."
The announcement that the water
supply of Port Arthur has been cut off
does not create particular anxiety here.
It Is explained that the water of Port
Arthur was never good and that the
fortress Is provldetl with a large dis
tilling apparatus.

LONDON, Sept. 10.â The Daily Ex
press says it has trustworthy informa
tion that the Russian army is divided
into five columns. The first has reach
ed Tie Pass (forty miles north* oÂ£ Muk
den) and is preparing to defend that
place against the Japanese. The sec
ond is midway between Mukden and
Tie Pass. The third is at Mukden. The
fourth, consisting of 40,000 men, under
General Myendorff, is holding General
Kuroki in check by hard fighting
twelve miles south of Mukden. ; The
fifth, of about 12,000 men, is further
south, exhausted by incessant righting
and harassed oif three sides by the
Japanese, its position being one of ex
treme danger from which it can hardly
hope to escape.
"Everything now depends," eays the
paper, "on Myendorff 's ability to hold
Kuroki in check, which thus far has
been successfully done."

FIFTH COLUMN IX DAXGEK.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 9, 6:20
p. m. â Official news from the front to
day confirms the reports from Muk
den that the Japanese are still resting
their main forces, but their outposts
are in contact with the Russians. The
latter continue to hold Sintsintin,
sixty-six miles east of Mukden, and
Russian cavalry . is operating over a
wide area east of Mukden to prevent
a Japanese column from slipping
and making Its way north.
" The reports that six more army
corps are to be mobilized are untrue.
As stated in these dispatches, only
two corps are mobilizing and at pres
ent there will be no object in mobil
izing more than the railroad is able
to transport. The present facilities
permit the transportation of a .'little
over one corps each month, but this
is expected to be increased in a few
days with the completion of the rail
road circling Lake Baikal.
The "War Office promises to give out
detailed figures to-morrow in regard
to the number of Russian wounded.
The press dispatches place the figure
at more than 12.000.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 10, 1:50
a. m.â It eeems to be definitely estab
lished that Field Marshal Oyama's
tired troops abandoned on Wednesday
the attempt to head off General Kuro
patkin, whose army has arrived safely
at Mukden after frightful experiences
floundering through mud and mire
over the Manchurian roads. Some de
scriptions of the scenes along the line
of retreat are almost incredible. They
tell how the men lay down in the mud
and slept In a drenching rain.
It is evident that the last determined
effort of the Japanese to bring Kuro
patkin to bay was made on Tuesday,
but the Russian commander in chief
faced about and two corps with artil
lery beat off the Japanese, while the
remainder of the troops continued t*
march to Mukden. After that the Jap
anese could only hang on the flanks
and try to shell the retreating columns
from the hills. The outposts are stlil
in contact, but they are not. even ex
changing Fhots.
A late dispatch sent to-night from
Mukden describes the horrible plight of
the tentless and shelterless soldiers.
The detailed statement of the Russian
losses, which it is promised will be
issued on Saturday, Is awaited with in
tense interest. The general expectation
is that the losses will approximate 20,
000, as against 30,000 for the Japanese.
The work of burying the dead was
left to the Japanese, who were forced
to attempt the task as a matter' of
self-preservation, but it was an almost
Impossible undertaking. The awful
rains have handicapped the work of
cremation, which the Japanese . re
lied on, and only shallow trench burials
v/ere possible in many cases. Not only
is such burial one of great difficulty,
but it is almost valueless from a sani
tary point of view, the storms un
doing it soon after it is accomplished.
The care of the wounded has taxed
the hospitals to the utmost. One cor
respondent says that 12,000 wounded
had passed through Mukden hospitals
up to Monday and only the most se
vere ' cases could be attended by the
nurses and surgeons. Many, there
fore, had to be left to the rough but
well-meant care of their comrades.
The proclamations are addressed to
the Jews in particular, but the appeals
are made to all the heterodox sects,
workmen and # socialists, and a new
feature is that special appeals are made
to soldiers and peasants. Many of the
proclamations have been seized, and
it is proved that they have been printed
in London. Until now they have met
with little response in Russia proper,
but tnere have beentceveral manifesta
tions in various places in Poland and
Southwestern -Russia, where the popu
lation is largely Jewish.
ST, PETERSBURG,, Sept. 10. : 3:55 a.
m.â Intense activity is being displayed
by gome Rusaophobic revolutionary or
ganizations abroad. It seems that they
have, united in an effort to appeal to
all the discontented classes of the Rus
sian population. Incendiary proclama
tions have be^n smuggled across the
border and distributed broadcast in the
towns and cities, and especially in Pol
ish and Jewish centers, calling on the
population to take advantage of the
Government's preoccupation, owing. to
the war, to rise against the authorities
and overthrow the autocracy. Such
propaganda in Russia always results
in an increase of violence.
Jews Are Being: Incited' to Rise
Against the Government.
SLAV EXEJ1I.ES ACTIVE.
Tho subsequent retreat of the Rus
sian army over the terrible roads, har
assed by the determined foe, is .re
garded as a brilliant feat by all, but
it is undeniable that Kuropatkin has
disappointed many of his old admirers,
who are unable to forgive the defeat,
and who now recall that Kuropatkin's
reputation was made as chief of Sko
beleff's staff and njot as a leader of the
army. .
They- know how^ carefully the posi
tion at Liaoyang was prepared, and
they have been assured that if Kuro
patkin accepted battle there he would
achieve victory. Instead, they, say, re
gretfully, he was outflanked and out
generaled.
The change in commanders at such a
critical time is regarded as extremely
unfortunate. . Although it is admitted
that the eastern army had to face Ku
roki, who had earned a reputation as
tne most skillful of the Japanese lead
ers, the poor showing which it made in
comparison with the southern army,
perhaps not altogether unjustifiably,
might be attributed to^this change of
commanders, and the battle might have
been won if Bildering had been able
to duplicate in the east the splendid
stand Â¦ which .the southern army made
against Oku and Nodzu. ,
But Bildering was twice repulsed) It
was the second repulse by the Japanese
forces on the Heights of Yentai which
induced Kuropatkin to order a retreat
and there are officers of the general
staff who believe that this order-' was
precipitate, holding that if Kuropat
kin had-followprl'.up the offensive on
September 2, - leaving, to , Stakelberg,
who arrived at : Kentai mines in time
to support Orloff, the blocking of the
sweeping movement, j the day might
have been eaved. These officers are
inclined to believe, that, like Napoleon
and some other of the world's greatest
generals, Kuropatkin suffered a tem
porary eclipse of judgment in recall
ing the army. corps which had launched
against Kuroki and in ordering a re
treat. As it was, they declare, Kuro
patkin's skill reasserted itself and
shone brightest ' in the hour of appar
ent disaster, when, massing his armies
along tlje branch railroad at Yentai, he
held the Japanese in check long enough
to enable the south force to. pass him
and escape northward.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. _ 10.â Now
that the ba.ttle of Liaoyahg is history,
officers- of the. general- staff- are-more
disposed to discuss some of the circumr'
stancesVof the tight, although they", lacl^
specific' confirmation, making itlifipos
sible for themto speak authoritatively
oh' many points.' General Kuropatkiri-'s
army at Liaoyangiconsisted of twenty
battalions of infantry, 147 squadrons of
cavalry and ,700 guns, approximately
108,000 bayonets, 15,000 sabers and " 10,
000 gunners., r. : ' Â¦':^;:;'-V-V'.v:,'/.
Portions of two European corps and
one Siberian . corps had jjj been - left at
Mukden, and a number of these
serves were brought into the fight.
"The size of the Japanese army has
not been definitely "established, but its
actual fighting force is supposed to
have had a superiority in numbers of
from 50,000 to 60,000 men and a consid
erable superiority in artillery.
One of the advantages possessed by
Field Marshal j Oyama, according to
Russian experts,"consisted in the great
er elasticity in movement and in hand
ling, on account of 'the. separation of
the respective armies of Generals Ku
roki, Oku, and Nodzu.
General Kuropatkin very late also in
troduced'the same system, after a fash
ion, when he created the eastern and
southern armies' under the respective
commands of Generals Ivanoff and Sa
roubaieff, but these arm>es had not
been acting independently for months,,
while the Japanese armies had been
acting separately.
On his arrival at the seat of war
Lieutenant General Bildering of the
Seventeenth Army Corps took over the
command of General Ivanoff, who,
though a seasoned and tried â¢ com
mander, familiar with his men, with
the field of battle and with the tactics
of the Japanese, had to give way to
a man older In years, but possessing
none of these advantages. '

TACOMA, Sept. 9.â Recently the
Methodists of Issaquah found their
church had been built on property not
belonging to the organization. - The
owners became troublesome and while
moving the church was imperative, the
church funds were so low that it was
practically- impossible. It was at this
time that a big windstorm came up
and beat fiercely upon the church. In
stead of falling the building scooted
along the ground in the direction of the
proper site owned by the congregation.
When it arrived on the site It stopped.
"All that was left for the trustees
to do." said Dr. Harrington in his re
port to the Methodist Conference, "was
to put jacks under the building and
construct the foundation."
When many of the ministers inti
mated they thought the church moving
a windy story Dr. Harrington, who is
presiding elder and a prominent di
vine, offered witnesses to prove his
statement. # The members of Issaquah

ADVERTISEMEXTS. _'_. -
f # AN D "^ OT H E R3.
The' Better, class* Qf druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devote their lives to the welfare of their fellow. men in supplying the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents 'of known valuej in accordance with physicians* prescriptions and
; scientific formula. â¢ i>ruggi8t8 of the belter class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under "original o'r, officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to .deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard "remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a^first^jlass pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and, remedial appliances.
..Thel earning of a iair. living, with -the satisfaction which- arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon" their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative-remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling. many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they, always take > .pleasure in handing out /the genuine article bearing the full
; name of tlie^Companyâ Calif ornia-Fig Syrup Co^â printed on the front of every package.
They know ; that in cases of colds and headaches attended, by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver- and bowels, arising from irregular habiti; indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant; prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs,' and they /are glad to sell it because, it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and thÂ©
immense demand for it, imitations have ; been made, tried and "condemned, but there are
individual druggists to; be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and.whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
â¢sometimes have the nameâ " Syrup of Figs"--dr "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter hi3
establishment, whether it be large^ or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
% physicians* prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
"Knowing that the great majority of. druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class of
druggists who wiHeellyou what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

ments were features of both entertain
ments. Mrs. A. J. de Lamare was

ed, while the larpe hall could not hold

to the splendid musical selections of
Armand PÂ«uz and his Third Band. Ar
tillery Oorps. The street in front of

tracted a gTeat crowd of people from
all parts of the neighborhood, who
perched on every available space to en
joy the music and watch the beautiful
ly gowned women as they came out
for a promenade on the sidewalk to
enjoy a breath of the fresh cooling
evening: air. The Lenox, which is just
opposite the hall, was gayly decked
with a great profusion of flags and
every window was filled with ladies
and their escorts, which gave the ap
pearance of proscenium boxes in the
Grand Opera-house. It was midnight
before the handsome entertainment
came to an end.

an Impostor.
Leo Demar, who said he was a wine
merchant of Boston and also a Knight
Templar of that city, succeeded in
passing a hard luck story on a Police
Judge of being robbed and beaten by
thugs and gained his dismissal on a
charge of disturbing the peace, proves
an impostor. After an investigation it
was found that no man by this name
was connected with Boston Comman

Demar called at the Central Emer
gency Hospital Thursday morning to
have a discolored eye dressed. Later
he was arrested by Policeman Dono
hue. who found him fighting with at
taches of a restaurant at Sixth and
Steveneon streets. At the station he
gave a, plausible story of being a
Knight Templar and tnat he was rob
bed of $650. He still possessed $95. The
police, believing his tale, released him.'
The next day his case was called be
fore Judce Mo^an and he repeated his
tale. The good-natured Judge express

Strike Off In, East St. Louis.
The Earl of ; Euston and his suite de
parted for the_ East yesterday after
noon. They, received a handsome send
off at the hands of the Knights Tem
plar, . fully in keepjng with the roy:il
reception that was accorded to them
on their arrival here Monday morning.
The feature of the departure was.thi*
Earl's presentation of a beautiful ban
ner of the Great Priory of England and
Wales to-California- Commandery- No.
1. This commandery had been appoint
ed a special escort to the' Earl while
he was sojourning in the city. -
Long before 5 o'clock, the hour an
nounced for the departure. of the Earl,
crowds began to assemble in the court
of the Palace Hotel, at the Market
street entrance and at the entrance to
the court in New Montgomery street.
Every window in both the Palace and
the Grand was filled with onlookers.
Promptly at 5 o'clock, the members of
California Commandery No. 1,' arrayed
in their knightly robes and mounted on
their splendid horses, drew up in front
of the entrance to the court." They had
only to wait a moment when" the Earl
appeared, accompaniet Jy Sir. Knight
Reuben H. Uoyd. As the Earl stepped
to the edge of the sidewalk Commander
Charles M. Plum dismounted from his
white charger and, with his chapeau in
hand, advanced to meet him.
In presenting the . banner \ the Earl
said: "I take great pleasure -in pre :
sen tins to you and the California Com
mandery No. 1" this banner of the Great
Priory of England and Wales. I *am
glad Â¦ I have this opportunity to . show
the appreciation that our.order has for
yours, and I take a special pleasure in
thanking you for the great assistance
and kindness you have shown to me
since I have been staying in your beau
tiful city."
Replying. Sir Charles M. Plum said:
"In accepting this beautiful banner al
low me to assure you that California
Commandery No. 1 will always cherish
this gift with loving .remembrance of
your visit to our country and to the
twenty-ninth Triennial Conclave held
in our city. May God speed you on
your homeward way to England."
At the conclusion of this - speech
the Earl handed* to Commander Plum
six superb badges, richly wrought -In
gold and jewels, representing the cross
of the Great Priory of England and
Wales, with the request that they be
presented to the highest officers in the
California Commandery. After these
formalities the â¢ Earl entered a coach
drawn by four black horses . and the
procession started on its march to the
railway station. A band led -the "way,
playing lively marches, and was' fol
lowed by the escort of honor, the Earl's
coach being last in the procession.
The crowds lining the streets cheered
heartily and the Earl acknowledged the
salutes by raising his hat and smiling
pleasantly as he passed on the wy to
his train for home.
CONFERS GRAND ' CROSS.
The Earl of Euston ' conferred the
grand cross of the Great Priory of
England and Wales upon Colonel Wil
liam Edwards and Major Cornelius
Toohey, two prominent local knights,
and decorated- them publicly with the
emblem of .the order, 1 a massive golden
Maltese cross, with the royal British
monogram in the center, surrounded
by the words "Great Priory of England
and Wales," surmounted by the crown
of Great Â¦ Britain, and suspended from
a cross bar and ribbon of the Victoria
Cross.
It was a pleasant interchange -: of
knightly courtesies which took place
quite unexpectedly at the Mark Hop
kins Institute of Art during the recep
tion of Golden" Gate 'Commandery on
last Thursday evening. The Earl and
his party of distinguished visitors from
England arrived somewhat late ' in the
evening and were made the. objects of

Several of the Knights who accom

coast remained, in. the, city and will
go East via the* northern route, first
visiting points of Interest in Northern
and Central California.
â¢ The escort of California Commandery
that has done such good service in : wel
coming the coming and' speeding the
parting' guests, performed '., Its final
function last night so far as the Grajid
Encampment of the Knights Templar
was concerned. Grand' Master-elect
George M. Moulton and ex-Grand Mas
ter Stoddard and all of the corps of
the Grand Encampment bid farewell
to the. city and left for Southern Cal
ifornia on the 8 o'clock .boat from the
Ferry building. A detachment of the
California Commandery ' mounted a es
cort,-a'band, and a number of Califor
nia Knights in carriages, accompanied
the departing officers to the city front.
Grand Master Moulton expressed
himself as highly pleased with the re
ception tendered the Knights during
their stay In San Francisco and he
spoke' feelingly of â¢ the, hospitality of
the State in general. Ex-Grand Mas
ter'Stoddard was also profuse in- hts
expressions of sincere, thanks for the
courtesies shown him.
There was a busy scene in the corri
dors of the Palace Hotel prior to the
departure of the Grand Encampment.
Delegations of Knights called to bid
godspeed to the departing quests and
to assist them in perfecting arrange
ments; for their, trip across the conti
nent. A special train awaited the
Grand Encampment on the Oakland
side. Â¦
Grand Commander Rinaldo Rich
ardson of Boston Commandery took
occasion. to thank the citizens of San
Francisco for the many courtesies ex
tended and in return said that he
gave the parade not so much for
the desire of parading as tc give the
citizens an opportunity to see the fine
body of men composing the Bostonian
delegation.
â¢ At 2- o'clock the California Com
mandery escort arrived at the St.
Francis and formed on the, west side
of Powell street, north of the hotel.
The Bostonians were lined alonsr the
east side of the street, photographs
were taken, and at 2:15 o'clock, with

the ferry passed without incident. Just
as the column reached the ferry plaza
the bands struck up "Auld Lang Syne"
and as 'they marched into the court
in N front of the ferry slips "Onward
Christian- Soldiers" was * played. A

the : commandery were joined by their
families. The party will stop at Salt

"This â¢ banner has been presented to

In giving this standard to this com
mandery the King shows that it is
presented to the commandery. on the
Pacific 'Coast that is most worthy to
receive it.'-
After this short speech the command
ery circled . the floor : of the pavilion,
carrying the -banner at their head,
while the spectators that lined the
stands and railings applauded them.
The Governor's staff were resplendent
in their uniforms and were accom
panied by . their ladies. At the begin
ning ceremony they, promenaded across
the floor .to ; "a -position, near the band

-Many took advantage of the excur
sions to witness the Admission day
celebration in Oakland. The earb*
boats to the pier were crowded and at
noon the Southern Pacific ferry sys
tem had all it could do to handle the
great crowds that awaited transporta
tion to the east side.
It is sufficient to say that the Gov
ernment at Washington is growing par
ticular regarding the location of its
coast batteries and just who shall
know thereof. The ' authorities la
charge of the Department of Califor
nia asked Washington; Washington
was too busy with other matters to
reply and it was concluded by those
in charge of the floating mines of mili
tary knowledge at Lime Point that it
was best for the Knights Temclar to
follow the axiom, "Don't tread on
me," and keep away from the sacred
soil of Fort Baker. The Knights came,
but were forced to disappear almost as
rapidly as the rifled defenders. of Point
Bonita. It was just a fishing excur
sionâthat's all.
The California Promotion Committee
had arranged to have their guests
leave the ferry building at 1:30 o'clock
in the afternoon on the regular boat
of the Sausalito line. On the Marin
side it was planned to have the excur
sionists met by a specially chartered
steamer that would carry them to Fort
Baker and the Point. When word
reached the committee that the Gov
ernment authorities had decided not to
allow the excursion to land at the forti
fications the committee immediately
sent word to the several commanderien
that the trip had been called off. All
who applied at headquarters were told
of the change of programme. ' â¢
Quite a number of Knights and tfleir
families had crossed the bay to Sausa
lito before learning of the decision.
They waited awhile for the special
steamer to show up, and on being in
formed that there would be none, they
spent the afternoon cruising about in
small boats, fishing, enjoying the "cool
shade of the wooded hills and the hos
pitality of the yacht clubs. They were
well pleased, after all, with the after
noon's outing.
Army officers explained that it Is not
customary to allow outsiders to visit
the fortifications about the harbor and
that it Is nothing new to exclude visit
ors therefrom.
"Great guns and little fishes" were
on the programme for the day's enter
tainment on the Marin side of the bay,
arranged* by the California Promotion
Committee, but the great guns proved
to be a masked battery, and the little
fishes came in cans and between small
slices of bread, with French mustard.
Military secrecy, army regulations
and an interruption of communication
with the War Department at Washing
ton put an abrupt end to the advertised
excursion to the fortifications . on the
north shore of the bay. SeveraL hun
dred Knights and. ladles who applied
for transportation went over to Sausa-
Hto in the hope of seeing a battery oÂ£
breech-loading sixteen-inch cannon of
the disappearing kind, but had to con
tent themselves with a short life on
the ocean wave in and about-Richard
son cove and a diet of sandwiches and
cold drinks.
Departures have thinned the ranks of
the Templars and weariness has at last
seized those that remain, so to-day, the
last of the conclave, will be quietly
passed. This morning at 11:50 o'clock
visitors that care to take advantage of
the opportunity may witness the
launching of the United States cruiser
Milwaukee at the Union Iron Works.
All Sir Knights in uniform and their
ladies will be admitted to the Iron
works. This will be the main event
of the day. In the afternoon and even
ing receptions will be held at the head
quarters of the various commanderies
of the California- jurisdiction, by the
ladies' committee at the Palace Hotel
and by California Commandery at Me
chanics' Pavilion and Golden Gate
Commandery at Golden Gate HalL
Yesterday many of the Sir Knights
end their families witnessed the Ad
mission day celebration of the Native
Sons at Oakland. Orders whose prin
ciples and purposes are similar to those
of the Native Sons of the Golden West
are almost unknown in the East.
Yesterday afternoon and last evening
the escort committees of California
Commandery were busy escorting de
parting commanderies to trains and
boats. To-day and to-morrow will wit
ness still more departures and by Mon
day night the last of the delegations
will have started home.

afford another contest .between Tam
many and the Hill forces in this State,
and nothing will be left undone . to
bring about harmony. The managers
realize the importance, above every
thing else, of bringing Tammany into
line and Charles F. Murphy will be a
prominent figure In ah the harmony
talk. No candidate will be decided
upon who is not acceptable to Tam
many as well as to the rural Demo
cratic leaders. It Is believed the choice
will lie between E. M. Shepard, Dis^
trict Attorney Jerome and Grout.
When Tammany started to pick a
candidate for Governor it is said that
consideration .was being given to Con
troller Edward M. Grout.

SHEEPSHEAD BAT, Sept. 9.â The
Omnium handicap at nine furlongs was
won to-day by Colonial Girl, the five
year-old daughter of Meddler, which
defeated Hermis in the World's Fair
handicap at St. Louis. As an evidence
of how slowly the field covered the first
half-mile, it may be mentioned that
McCtiesney, although left at the post,
joined the other horses on the back
etretcli. The fractional time of the first
dx furlongs was as follows: Furlong,
0:13; Quarter, 0:26; three furlongs,
0:Â£8 4-S; half. 0:51; five furlongs,
1:03 J-6; six furlongs, 1:16 1-5; full dis
tance, nine furlongs, 1:6S 8-5. or but
little better than a good selling plater s
performance.
The ring wu saved a hard blow
when Mlsa Modesty ran third Instead
of first In the opening event. The filly
is owned br Albert Simons. She was
formerly owned by L. V. BelL The
average opening betting against her
mt&b 15 to 1 and If she could have won
a fortune would have been captured by
come bettors.

The tandem race went to Long and
McLaughlln of the Bay City Wheel
men, but the pace was too slow. It
was declared no contest, as the time
was outside 12:20.
The prettiest event of the day waa
the half-mile ''>* coast championship.
From start to finish the wheels were
so closely bunched that they looked
like one machine. Walter de Mara
led under the wire by half an Inch.
The mile went to W. C. Waibla
of the Garden City Cyclers. When he
came through at the finish with a fine
burst of speed a delegation of lassies
from San Jose threw their parasols
Into the air. Waible. the popular, also
whizzed past everything in the two
mile handicap.
The two motor races were easy for
Arthur Yonse of the New Century
Club. C. McCormick, who rode against
him. sot castor oil in his motor instead
of- .benzine, and the machine had
croup every once in a while.
The pursuit race was a wonderful
test of endurance. The teams did
their ten miles nicely, although the
track was like the Interior of a hot
oven. The Garden City representatives
had by far the best of it, though one
of the team had an upset. Earl Gray
turned turtle and plowed about an
acre of track with his face.
The first day's meet of the California
Associated Cyclists drew an enthusi
astic crowd of bicycle fans yesterday
to Ingleside racecourse. The after
noon was a triumph for 'California

- The â¢ postponed \ field day of Gaelic
sports,, under . the .auspices of the
United Irish Societies, which was to be
held on March 17- last, was decided
yesterday at the Presidio athletic
grounds and proved a decided success.
A large crowd attended and cheered
the winners in the various events. The
day was an ideal one for such sport.
Some. of the best amateur athletes par
ticipated in the various events.
The card was composed of races at
different distance, shbtput and other
athletic exercises. In each case the
contests excited great enthusiasm. The
hurling " match for a trophy was
awarded to the Emmet Club by de
fault, as their opponents, â¢ the Inde
pendents, failed to materialize.
Great interest was shown in the
half-mile relay race, which brought
two teams on the field. The St. Mary's
College team, composed of four crack
sprinters, beat the Vampire team.
The winners were given' a rousing re
ception after their victory, as they had
many: admirers in. the stand.
Usually in a mile race the runners
are strung out, but it was not so yes
terday. One of the most spirited fin
ishes that , has been seen In many a
day happened when A. Glarner of the
Vampire Club defeated H. H. Man
drell, unattached, in â¢ the last five
yards. . Â¦ _- . - /

Outside of an occasional brilliant
stroke by Whitney the match consisted
chiefly, of lobbing. Had: young: ; Griffin
been possessed of more experience ". the
result might have been different. Allen
was the mainstay of his 'team and his
MacGavin has acquired steadiness
since the last championship tourna
ments and this tells the story of his
victory. He outplayed Murdock at the
net and was steadier in the back court.
Bell will have to play his best game
if he hepes to boat MacGavin to-day, j
The spectators had their first oppor
tunity to tee Champion May Sutton
since her return from the East. It was
her first match In singles and she re
ceived a hearty welcome when she
stepped on the courts. , That she was
deserving of this applause she soon
demonstrated by defeating her sister,
Florence, in straight sets.
The little champion started with a
rush and in the first* set Florence won
only one game. The latter improved In
the second set and . to the surprise of
all ran the score to .4-J. In her favor.
This was more than any woman In the
East had done and May. fearful lest
she should lose a set for, the first time
in her career, put more speed into her
strokes and won five games straight.
Florence, although beaten, -was --not
disgraced and has the satisfaction of
knowing that no ; other woman player
In the United States could have beaten
her but her 'sister.. Miss Moore, the
ex-natlc-nal champion,' did not get more
than two games in any. set against May
and In one match failed to win a
game. Florence, gave . her sister the
hardest battle of her career and the
little champion had anything but a
walkover. It -is well known that a
Sutton never gives a game away, ; so
the games Florence won' were earned.
The finals. of the'men's doubles were
not particularly classy, but .was inter
esting from Btart to finish. It .was "as
close a match as erne would care. to see
and the rallies were exceptionally long.
The old game of "get the balls back"
won the day for Allen and Baker. They
won the first two sets .and it looked
like a "straight' set" match. In the
third and , fourth sets Whitney and
Griffin steadied down and also com
menced a safe game. These two sets
Whitney and Griffin won quite easily
and when they led at S-l and 40-15 in
the Â¦ final set victory seemed : assured
them. Baker was about to give it up,
but the old warhorse Allen stayed wjth
it and pulled out the set when it looked
lost to them.. They won four. straight
games, giving them a lead of 5-3. Whit
ney and Griffin made a last effort and
tied . the â¢ score at 5-5. .. ThÂ© -next . two
games and set went to Allen and
Baker.wUUMflHttUl - - ' '-Â¦
An unusual number of spectators
braved the heat at San Rafael yester
day and witnessed some of the best
tennis games of the week. Two .cham
pionships were decided and three more
will be up for decision to-day. . Miss
May Sutton successfully defended her
title to the championship of the coast,
beating her sister Florence.' in the
challenge match. Will Allen and George
Baker beat It. X. Whitney and Clar
ence Griffin in the finals of the men's
doubles and th.2 championship gees to
them by default. Freeman and Bell
will not be on har.d to defend.
J. D. MacGavin beat Percy Murdock
in the finals of the men's singles tour-,
nament and will play Alfonso Bell for
the championship this afternoon. The
MacGavin match brought out the best
tennis of the day. Murdock started
like a winner, taking the -first set by
a 6-3 score. MacGavin changed from
a drive to a chop Etroke in the next
three sets and to this he owes his vic
tory. The second and third sets he
won easily. In the second set Murdock
won only one game and in the third
secured but one more.
In the fourth and last set Murdock
fought desperately and at one time
needed but c-ne more point to win the
set. This was where the score stood
6-5 and 40-30 in his favor. MacGavin
brought the score to the deuce and "then
won it out 8-6.

ciation. The crowd was large numeri
cally and in enthusiasm.. , It fairly,
packed the sloping banks, extending
half a mile on each side of the course,
and scores of boats laden with passeiw
gers ; llitted around the starting point
and frequently provoked the judges to
profanity by their trespassing upon
the water reserved for the contestants.
Two brass bands alternated in produc
ing good music and the tlirong 'never
slighted an opportunity to cheer. .Bach
race was started amid encouraging
shouts and finished amid a mighty ac^
claim complimentary to the victor.
* In addition -to the seven pro
grammed events there were three im
promptu natatorial features that
served to enhance the Interest of the
spectators. Alex Pape, the crack
oarsman , of the Dolphins, had -the
senior shell race well in hand and. was
coming home easily when, one of his
sculls fouled 'a stake pole and he was.
upset. Soon afterward Alex Keegan
ol. .' the Ariels caught a "crab" as- he
was fairly getting down to work in
the junior outrigger skiff race. He
succeeded in righting his boat without
aid and was slowly, pulling for home
when over and down he went again.
Then he. and his waterlogged craft
were taken in tow by a sailboat and
were run ashore.'. In the final event,
for junior, shells, Harry Dumont of
the Alamedas damaged his boat' in
some., unexplained way and after arÂ»
riving at the finish it gracefully went
down and left him swimming. These
several mishaps seemed to be even
more productive of thrills among the
gentler sex than were the closest
finishes. Â¦

In our pride. Our pioneer fathers and mothers

who laid the foundation of our glorious Cali

loving gratitude for their undying and unfal
tering loyalty to duty and affection for home
that has been inculcated In their descendants.
The visitors among us must realize why we
The Native Sons of the Golden West in their
original organization carved out for themselves
the duty of keeping- alive the traditions of
the 'early days of California, to create in the
minds of the young men of our State an ap
preciation of the trials, struggles and sacri
fices of the pioneers, the fathers of California.
In the early times of our order it was not
dreamed that It would attain such a place In
the commonwealth's activities as it has
reached. It has performed that first duty of
love and more than that It has bullded upon
character. It has takon upon itself the charge
to lift up the patriotism of the sons of Cali
fornia, to make them better men 'for their
affiliation with this great organization and to
keep uppermost in their minds an, ever
tttrengthenlng pride In strong devotion to the
State and to our country.
A race of creat men and women must, at
least until stern nature wills It otherwise,
produce its like. The men and women,
pioneers who came to California two score
years and more aso> were strong and sturdy,
both in mind and limb. The weaklings never
left the homestead nor dared the dafzerB
that the journey hither called for. Our pioneers
carved from the wilderness an empire and
upreared a State, which, in hardly more than
half a century, has compelled the admiration
of the world and has drawn to her as the
magnet does the steel well nigh a million
and three-quarters of hardy men and beauti
ful women, who love our native State as only
California can be loved by those who- live
within h?r borders. With such forefathers,
with such a population, California's great
ness Is secure. Her sons and daughters will
do well thÂ»lr parts toward forcing ever on
ward In the fray her peaceful standard. And
in the ranks of those who do and dare, fight
ing In the very forefront, will be always
found those who, like us. are proud to claim
California as their birthplace.
For the Native . Sons Grand First
Vice President Gallagher gave respon
sive greeting as follows:
This anniversary of the birth of the Golden
State flndf California's people happy, content
ed and prosperous. To us the God of nations
has ever been kind. Over us Is hoverins: the
destinies that the over westward course of
the empire has given to our land. And hurry
ins down, upon us, with a speed never known
before, are events, responsibilities and oppor
tunities that will make our State the re
incarnated Greece and Rome of the twentieth
century. , To furnlnh . men and women for
world's work, such ' as "is already here, is
California's present duty. Is the race of men
and women born beneath her genial skies
possessed of virtue and of force of mind that
will compel such bending of events and men
as California needs demand? Or shall we
find Napoleons in the throng of those who
come to uÂ» from other climes?
prove to the world and to themselvÂ«a that
they are fitted to ,take the lead of our glori
ous commonwealth In her onward career of
progress and a higher civilization.

the city miide up It* mind that it was
RfhiS to make the day memorable, not
b|<NM to the visiting Native Sons, but
to all others who FhnuM com** within
its gat?s.
But while this \vÂ«fÂ» the general crim

\hc\f was still nnother gathering of

Oa\laiÂ»d to-day was stormed by Na
tive Sons in uniform. Native Daughters
In lisht dre-pses. and miscellaneous vis
itor* in every kind of garb possible,
from thp uniformed members of the
KntchtF Tomplar to the scanty suits of
th? participants in thÂ»* boating races
on Lak< M. rritt. Everybody who vis
ited Oakland made himself at home and
everybody who was in Oakland exerted
himsolf t<Â» make th<Â» visitors comforta
ble in ppite of the wrathor.
Thi' pnra<U> surprised even those who
had planned it. It was an event of
which Oakland can be proud, for it
was twice as long as was expected and
â¢â¢ojitHimd more attractions than even
the committees planned for. The mem
bers of the local parlors, who arranged
the celebration. 'wore dumfounded at
the number of visitors. Arrangements
had bÂ«-r>n made for 2900 men and women
in line, but the number that paraded
thruuch the streets of Oakland more
than doubled the original estimate. It
was this fact that caused several vexa
tious delays qn the line of march. The
OflSOfN <'f the parade were not pre
pared to handle thÂ«? number of mem
ber* of the two orders that presented
themselves, and several stops had to
lw made when turns and counter
marches took placÂ«*.
In spite Â«..f all this, and in spite of,
the hottest day that Oakland has seen
for many y^arP, the visiting Natives
had a good day. The parade was full
Of variety. There were many different
ard attractive uniforms and many fea
tures. The Native Daughters, particu
larly, added to the beauty of the pa
rade by their light drosses and bright
appeararce. Add to this the presence of
Governor George C Pardee, who had
re-turned to his old home, and other
crkbrltles of both State and national
importance, who were present, and the
celebrct'.on assumed unwonted impor
tance. Governor Pardee was repeatedly
cheered along the route by his former
townsmen, who recognized him and
wifihrd t<< him honor.
After the parade the visitors scat
tered. Some went to the literary exer
cises at the High School building, and
many to the regattn at -Lake Merrltt.
ThÂ»- racing men all declare that Lake
Merritt is the ideal place for a regatta.
The (Water is still and offers all con
tes ants f .ilike a fair chance, while any
number of spectators can find places
upon the banks of the lake from which
to witness the races.
There were many who did not wish
\iy see the race*, however, and the Oak
land lodge i,f KlkÂ« threw open its hand
pome rooms and welcomed everybody
who was either Oaklander or visitor.
AH -afUTr"Â»on the rooms were crowded
and the Klks made good their reputa
tion for hospitality by the way in
which they welcomed the visiting Na
tives on behalf of the city of Oakland.

Signs ; of .better conditions In \ the
leading manufacturir- industries mul
tiply, as '.the season advances and the
Crop progress is better than aver
age and high prices promise large
profits to the farmers. Railway, freight
is heavy, chiefly due to the' marketing
of grain' and cotton, and earnings in
August were 2.8 per cent larger than
in 1903.
. Domestic trade holds up better than
foreign commerce, which suffers from
pricfes above the views of consumers
abroad, yet the last week's returns for
this port are encouraging, $736,363 in
comparison with the same week last
year, while imports gained $2,678,
343.. â¢ Â¦Â¦ - Â¦.*/ : . ' ' â¢ . Â¦Â¦:,'-::
In iron and steel, past and prospec
tive price reductions have encouraged
inquiry, consumption has finally over
taken production and stocks of crude
material are smaller.- With the be
ginning of the crop movement, which
is -reasonably heavy for this period,
have come improved collections and
better railway earnings .returns. Aug
ust results point to a 6 per cent In
crease in gross receipts over a year
ago. All in all the prospects continue
favorable for a fairly active trade in
most lines, but nothing in the way of
record breaking is looked for in gen
eral business or. in crop outturn. .
The stubborn- strength' of prices is
perhaps the most, notable feature in
the entire situation. Bradstreet's gen
eral index number shows a very small
percentage of increase on September
1 over August 1, with provisions and
groceries, fruits, hides, leather, oils
and breadstuffs showing most
strength.

NEW YORK. SepL 9. â R. G. Dun &

morrow will say:
influence is calculated to
check ) distribution of merchandise,
but the past week has brought more
encouraging results in the business
world and from many points come re
ports of steadily, expanding trade,
while it is not exceptional to find
comparisons with the corresponding
week last year favorable to 1904. Re
tall trade In fall lines, of dry goods,
clothing, millinery and nearly all
wearing apparel shows a healthy
growth and for hardware, : household
utensils and kindred lines there is a
broader demand. The best develop
ment of the. week was the resumption
of work in many industries that, have
suffered through strikes, while sev
eral serious j controversies j were avert
ed.^:---'''V- : - -Â¦Â¦.:Â¦Â¦;.Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ " .. â¢ .
Trade, crop and industrial develop
ments have been generally favorable
this week. Distributions on fall and
winter trade: accouuf.have enlarged at
most markets, the corn crop having
progressed another week toward final
maturity, which, however, . this year,
is later than usual, and several Indus
tries hitherto greatly depressed or op
erating on short time have resumed
running full. -The industrial situation
is slightly less etrained than it was
and the beef strike is now ended.

Nothing clings to popular favor lika
the circus parade. There is peculiar
warrant for this in a display like that
of Rlngling Bros., announced for next
Monday morning. With them it is
always new and always interesting. No
San Francisco man or boy ever tlrea
of seeing the elephants carry their
great bulks through the crowded
streets and no one is bored by observ
ing the humps on the camels as they
drift by. The roaring lions in the
gaudy cages never cease to bÂ« an ob
ject of curious wonder, and the pert
ponies always provoke the exclama
tion, "Aren't they cute?" The clowns,
acrobats, minstrels. Jugglers, musi
cians, soldiers, high stepping horses,
open animal dens, with keepers sit
ting quietly in the midst of their wild
charges, smart traps, gayly gowned
women riders, gorgeous tableau floats,
courtier attendants, fun-making
clowns, all possess a peculiar charm
which never fails to give the streets a
holiday air. â¢ ..* ; v.
The Ringlinga carry nearly every
animal specimen that went into the
ark with Noah and a few more not
mentioned in the list of "among those
present." Another good point with
the < Rlngling shows is the establish
ment of a -ticket office downtown
where no extra charge is made for ad
mission tickets and reserved chairs.

The new year ceremonies will be fol
lowed later in the month by the formal
observance of other holidays in the
Jewish calendar, among them being the
fast of Guadaliah. the Yom Kippur,
the feast of the Tabernacles and. the
feast attending the rejoicing of thÂ«
law. The business houses of the city
conducted by Jews will be closed until
Monday, while employers and em
ployes are attending to their religious
duties. * â¢
To-day the regular new year will
be celebrated in all the local syna
gogues and in several there will bo
ceremonies to-morrow. At the Temple
Emanu-El to-day the Rev. Jacob
Voorsanger will preside and to-morrow
the eloquent orator will deliver a ser
mon in the Beth-Israel Temple on
Geary street. The members of all the
synagogues look forward to Rosh
Hashona with the keenest Interest and
this year they have increased their
choirs and arranged elaborate musical
programmes for the annual event.
These will include the rendering of
many cherished religious melodies of
the Jewish faith.
The blowing of the shofar in" many
of the homes in San Francisco at sun
down last evening proclaimed the ad
vent of Rosh Hashona. the Jewish New
Year, the coming of which is always
hailed with traditional ceremonies ot
a festive character. The new year is
the five thousand six hundred and
sixty-fifth of the Jewish calendar, and.
as is the custom, its arrival was
marked by home gatherings, where
the followers of the faith maks prep
arations for the day of atonement.
Short services were also held in sev
eral of the synagogues.
At Republican headquarters In this
El&te the result of the Vermont elec
tion is accented as conclusive proof
that the gold Democrats are again vot
ing for sound money and prosperity.
The prediction is now made that the
majorities for Roosevelt next Novem
ber in the New England and Middle
States will exceed those given by the
E3me States for McKinley in 1900.
Politicians here and elsewhere as
s^rn California to a permanent place
in the Republican column. Party lead
ers would not be surprised if Roose
velt should lead Parker by 60.000
\otes in this State.
The battle for Congressmen in Cali
fornia promises to be interesting. The
Republicans will not achieve a full
mad complete triumph if a single one
ot the eight Congressional districts
rends a Democratic to the House of
Representatives. With a delegation of
lea Republicans in Congress, two Sen
ators and eight Representatives, the
t>tate can command recognition.
Intelligence comes to the Repub
lican State Committee that the Demo
Â« rats, while supporting Judge Parker
in a. perfunctory manner, will exert
special efforts to elect their Congres
sional nominees in the Second, Fourth.
Fifth and Sixth districts. The Repub
lican leaders are quite confident of
success in the Second, Fifth and Sixth.
The Fourth is in the air. so to speak,
as the Republicans will not nominate
a candidate until September 22.
STXTU DISTRICT.
J. C Needham, the Republican
nominee in the Sixth District, is re
garded as very nearly invincible. Talk
in the Democratic camp that his op
ponent. Judge W. Mi Conley of Ma
oera. is a great vote-getter Is not jus
tified by figures. Conley ran for As
sociate Justice on the Democratic
lirkol in 1S9S. He was the nominee
of the Democrats, the People's party
and the Silver Republicans. He re
Â«â¢Â« ived 109,742 votes. W. Van Dyfce.
the Democratic nominee for the other
Justiceship, received 117.287 votes.
Judge Maguire, who headed the
Democratic ticket that year, got 129,-
L'61 votes. The figures plainly show
that Conley ran far behind his ticket.
SECOND DISTRICT.
The Republicans of the Second Con
gressional District were in bad form
two years ago. By reason of dissen
sions and discord In the party many
Republicans voted for Bell, because
Frank L*. Coombs openly proclaimed
in favor of Senator Thomas Flint for
Governor as against Henry T. Gage.
Bolls majority was very slight on the
face cf the returns and it is the gen
eral impression that a recount of the
ballots would have shown Coombs'
election. The latter, however, did not
contest the election. Bell is endeavor
ing now to credit hl:nso]f with meas
ures of legislation accomplished by
Senator Perkins and other Republi
cans, but the only thing he accom
plished in Congress was the adoption
of an amendment to the appropriation
bill forbidding the apportionment of
Federal monÂ»y to any State soldiers'
home that maintained a canteen. The
only persons in California benefited
by this legislation ore a few saloon
keepers near Yountville, although the
prohibition papers applaud Bell for
his efforts in the cause of temperance.
The Republicans of the Second Dis
trict are now united and enthusiastic
in support of Duncan E. McKinlay.
Bell has forfeited all chances of Re
publican support by referring to Presi
dent Roosevelt as a dangerous man.
The Naoa Register, one of the leading
Republican papers of the district. In
pists that the Democratic nominee for
Congress shall define wherein the
President is dangerous.
The Oakland Tribune's San Fran
cisco correspondent writes:

ing in Washington anyhow, spending a largÂ«
part of fc-s time on a farm in Connecticut,
and cuairrlins with !J\-Â«mash and Wyr.n
whenever be went to Washington.
FIFTH DISTRICT.
All the element* of the Republican
party of the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict favor the election of E. A. Hayes.
The district is normally Republican,
although in the of
1800 by the State Legislature several
stronsr Republican A/iÂ£Pmbly districts
were taken from the Fifth to
ritrengtlien the Republican column in
the Â¦Fourth. The wise politicians, who
"knew it all." blundered, because they
weakened the Fifth without giving
rufflcient reinforcement to the Fourth;
hence in the campaiiem of 1902 the
party lost both districts. E. A. Hayes
Is a Republican leader of acknowl
et!ge<3 ability and energy. He is dis
playing tsct nm a politician and ell the
sUrna point to his njecesa.

LONDON, Aug. ii.â English labor
leaders are astonished at the style
American delegates are able to main
tain when they arrive on this side.
They put up at the most luxurious
hotels and it is estimated that their
expenses during this sojourn here run
Into a higher figure than the total of
the emoluments received In twelve
months by any of the English labor
leaders.
The annual International Trades'
Congress takes place in Leeds the first
week in September and it is stated that
a j greater number of American dele
gates will be present than has ever
been seen at the English congress be
fore. John Mitchell has been here for
some weeks and Messrs. Ryan and
Driscoll have just arrived. They are all
stayihf at the Hotel Russell, which
ranks in the same class with such lux
urious caravansaries as the Cecil. Carl
ton or Savoy hotels. Mitchell will rep
resent the American miners and Ryan
and Driscoll the National Federation
of Labor. Several other labor repre
sentatives will reach London in the
course of the next week or two.
Hitherto the United States has been
satisfied with sending two delegates
only. The trouble with the coal miners
in both countries and the meat strike
in America are said to be responsible
for the increase In the representation.
Workers in the meat trade in England
have never yet been organized and it
is believed to be the intention of the
American delegates to bring them into
line with the American workers on this
particular trade. If they succeed it is
probable the combination will cause a
crisis in the meat trade between Eng
land and America that will require
very careful handling. It would be
dMHcult to replace the present workers
in the meat trade in England by free
or non-union labor if the former de
cided to go on strike. They are usually
recruited from the very roughest sec
tion of the working classes and once
aroused it would require the whole of
the police "in London to keep them in
check. There have been a few efforts
to organize the meat workers during
the last week or two in consequence
of excitement produced by the Ameri
can trouble, but it was decided at a
meeting held privately on Saturday
evening last In the neighborhood of
Smith field market to postpone further
action pending the arrival of repre
sentative meat workers from America.

IN the Sunday Call Magazine to-morrow will appear the first in
stallment .of one of the cleverest of the summer's novels, a story
of bohemian life in Paris and London, "Anna the Adventuress,"
by E. Phillips Oppenheim. The story deals with the fortunes of two
sisters, one struggling to gain recognition as an artist, the other
a favorite of the Parisian dance halls and a prominent figure in the
faster side of Parisian life. The interests of. the two sisters, who
are' very similar in face and form, become strangely interwoven.
Anna, with the hope of reforming her wayward sister and with the
desire to help her to a profitable marriage, unselfishly shoulders the
blame and lives under the stigma of the escapades of her notorious
sister. The love interest is especially strong and is sustained with
all the power at the command o^an experienced novelist who writes
of a life that he is thoroughly familiar with. The story will appear
in four installments, aptly illustrated.
Other fiction features embrace an article by Marie Corelli,
"Accursed Eve," in which the relations of men and women are dis
cussed with all the keen insight into human motives and actions at
the command of one of the most remarkable writers of the day;
Jerome K. Jerome contributes a somewhat facetious dissertation,
"The New Fad in Literature"; "A Batch of Love Letters," a new
serial, begins, the initial installment of which, "Cupid in Country
Quarters," is from the pen of Sir George Douglas, Bart. Each
succeeding installment will be handled by a different -writer, all be
ing names familiar to readers of fiction. "Swart Pete's Wedding at
Grizzly Gulch" is a clever California storiette, and there are storiettes
by Richard Shelton and Dorothy Douglas.
There are as usual many, pages of special articles. Madge Moore
tells how to make a potpourri of roses; Augusta. Prescott describes
the new shirt waist styles for fall; the. physical. culture series con
tinues with exercises. for the trunk; and there is a full page story
with illustrations, showing. the old Aztec methods of mining. and
beating copper. The puzzle page and the music page are in colors
and there are many shorter articles of interest.

KNIGHTS TEMPLAR â Subscriber.
City. .The Knights Templar owe their
organization to seven French Knights,
together with Hugues de Paganes and
Goeffrey de St. Omer, who, in the
twelfth century, founded the order In
Jerusalem for the protection of pil
grims to the Holy Sepulcher. Gov
ernors were appointed In every country
and known as masters of the temple,
and by degrees the ranks, which at
first were filled by wealthy laymen,
were thrown open* to "spiritual persons
not bound by previous vows," and
finally laymen of humble birth were
admitted as serving brothers. Knights
Templar Is the , designation given In
Freemasonry to the comma nderiea
which are the representatives of the
ancient Knights Templar.
The Government has made It possible
for every 'woman in the country who
owns a. few mulberry trees to keep her
self In pin money, provided she is will
ing to work for it at the rate of six
weeks in the year, telegraphs the
Washington correspondent of the New
York Tribune. ,
Silkworms the world over feed on ttfe
leaves of the mulberry, and after an
experience of more than two years the
Agricultural Department is justified in
the belief that America in time will be
able to rival the looms of Italy and
France. In order to Interest the people
of the country in this new field of work
the department will send to any appli
cant silkworms enough to start busi
ness, with full instructions how to
make the venture a Euccess. When the
crop is gathered the department .will
pay for the cocoons on a scale of $1 a
pound when dry. It is such simple
work and so easily done that women
and even children can engage in it
profitably, and if conducted intelli
gently there Is no reason why silk cul
ture cannot yield as good results as the
raising of chickens or bees, with far
less trouble. For Instance, a half-dozen
mulberry trees will net the culturist
about $60 a year. There will be literally
little or no expense and the care of the
worms means a few weeks' work in the
springtime, when it is a positive pleas
ure to be out of doors.
In a sunshiny room In the Arglcul
tural Department three young women
are kept busy every day, reeling' silk
from the cocoons that, are being sent
,in from nearly every State in the
Union, notably Utah and â¢ Alabama.
Afterward it Is twisted â¢ into shining
yellow hanks, ready for the mills of
Paterson,. where it will be 'woven Into
native ribbons and silks.
As the .department pays out. $4 for
the raw material, to say nothing of the
expense, of clerk hire, Â¦books of .instruc
tion, machinery and' even mulberry,
cuttings for those who have no tree's/
It wiH be seen that ..the additional >1
a pound given by the mills does not
begin to cover the cost â¢' of the under
taking. The Government s does not
mind a small thing like that, .however,
if the. outcome proves ' successful, and
the department : has { pledged > itself to
buy all cocoons sent in until. sucli time
as the outputencourages" the erection of
silk mills throughout the country,
when the market will be general, 'as in
the case of other staple products. .

gBound for all the advanced ideas re
specting the arbitration of labor dis
putes, state ownership or control of
public utilities and the ballot, says a
contributor of â¢ the Philadelphia Led
ger. Whether these experiments suc
ceed or fail in practice, Australia is
doing the rest of the world service as
an object lesson. A contribution to
the current number of the Nineteenth
Century and After, by a Melbourne
woman, on "The Political Woman in
Australia." presents an interesting
resume of the progress made in the
political emancipation of woman un
der the most favorable circumstances.
The writer" rejoiqes in the fact that
her country has granted her sex ab
solute political equality with men and
has thereby reached "a position
unique in the world's history." The
Australian constitution is peculiar in
that it has no sex limitations. The
women enjoy the right to vote equally
with men, may 'become members. of
the Legislature' and hold other of
fices. It required about twenty years
to persuade the Australian woman to
ask for the franchise; but it finally be
came her possession and had a
marked j influence upon the recent
Federal elections, when the women
voted in as large numbers proportion
ately as the men hi. most of the con
stituencies.
. The writer notes that the women as
a rule voted 'for the candidates who
stood for economy in public expendi
tures and for careful national house
keeping. 'Â¦;-Â¦ To the assertion commonly
heard wherever woman suffrage is
urged, that women will vote as the
men desireUhe writer replies^ that the
elections showed that the women, on
the whole, voted with independence:
at any rate, that they did , not vote a

HIS LIST EFFORT.
HUMOR OF THE DAY.
COPYRIGHT, 1904. BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL AND THE NEW YORK EVENING MAIL.
WHILE all business men feel confident of the safe and sound
condition of the country, it is a- further addition to their
feeling of security to have it affirmed, by the able Secretary
oi the Treasury in his political and his non-partisan addresses. In
his talk to the "business men of all parties who gave him a banquet
here on Monday night, he showed that, with the largest volume of
circulating currency in the world, the most money per capita of
any natioq, and every dollar equal to gold, the" standard for it all, we
are in a position td" avoid any business vicissitude by having the
resources to meet it and avert it. â¢
The gold standard has so increased our stock of that metal
that we are able to sustain in circulation $300,000,000 of greenbacks,
pure fiat money, with no value except for redemption in! gold, and
can also carry a silver dollar circulation of $300,000,000 less in its
intrinsic than in its nominal value. Our gold stock is capable of car
rying all this, and the gold standard makes every dollar worth a
hundred cents.
But the Secretary appreciates, as do all financiers, the desir
ability of doing still better in the future, by substituting sortie other
and better form of curreiyy\for the fiat paper and the over-valued
silver. It is believed, and there is much financial experience to jus
tify it. that a gradual elimination of the fiat paper would result in
supplying its place by gold. As the Treasury retains $150,000,000
reserve gold to redeem the fiat money, that sum would be released ;
at once, and it is easily thinkable that gold certificates as a convenient
paper currency would soon take the place of the rest of the fiat
notes. Some time this part of the problem must be approached,
dealt with and solved, and when it is, fiat currency will be a thing
of the past. .- : ;;f. 'V
Maintenance of .the present volume of standard dollars in silver
is not exactly the same as support of fiat paper, because each silver
dollar, having one leg to stand on, is only 'half the burden on a gold
dollar that a fiat dollar is. Yet the time will come that standard
silver will disappear from our circulation, largely by conversion into
subsidiary coin, and thus will be realized the*purpose of the coinage
act of 1853, a Democratic measure, the purpose of which was de
clared -to be a sufficient supply of subsidiary, silver to serve the
public convenience in small transactions, leaving gold the standard
and the currency for large transactions. ; "-%.-}
In respect of these two measures the currency question, greatly
advanced toward a settlement since 1896, awaits a scientific con
clusion. Another feature in our currency system was referred to
at length in the banquet speech of" the Secretary. The Call has
been insistent in arguing for a more flexible banking system, .that
will enlarge the volume of currency in such commercial emergen
cies as the annual movement of the crops, and contract, it again
when the necessity is past.
Without suggesting it as the only plan, or going to the extent of
an official indorsement, the Secretary said : "Suppose the national
banks are permitted to issue a certain volume of currency, either
based upon the capital of the bank, or upon the amount of bond se
cured currency, and are charged not less than 5 per cent interest
during the time this currency is out. Certainly such currency will
spring into existence whenever money is scarce, and if the banks
are compelled to pay 5 per cent interest thereon, they will retire it
as soon as the pinch is over. It can be retired by the deposit of an
equal volume of currency at any of the sub-treasuries. It will not
be-necessary to redeem each individual bill. The volume would be
contracted as much by the deposit as by the destruction of the
bank bills. The interest charged would vastly more than cover any
possible loss. I desire to go upon record as being opposed to the
issue of any kind of currency the Government does hot guarantee,
and I am equally opposed to the Government guaranteeing bank
currency without first being amply secured."
Our California bankers have not been hospitable to the propo
sition for an emergency issue. Perhaps this is because they feel the
pinch less than it is felt in the financial center, New York. But the
sentiment of one part of the country arising in its local situation
should not stand in the way of a measure for general relief which
may safeguard the whole country against a currency pinch that
may degenerate into a panic. As we have often pointed out, the
problem is not one so much of volume as of distribution of cur
rency. An emergency issue will reinforce distribution, by appear
ing where the necessity is and disappearing when it is over.

NEW YORK, Sept. 9.â Reading held
the center of the Stock Exchange stage
and its violent movement was the
dominant influence on the whole mar
ket. WMen It broke to more than a
point under last night, after the mar
ket had opened strong, it was concluded
that important speculative interests
were getting out and the . traders
rushed to follow the movement. Union
Pacific also got a point under last night
and the Pacifies continued to be af
fected by profit taking all day.
Some- selling of stocks was based on
the belief in damage reports to the
corn crop. ! That oereal, however, was
Inclined to decline in price. This was
attributed in part to the disposition to
take profits in It before the appearance
of the Government's monthly report to
morrow. This report is also awaited
with Interest in the stock market as a
measure of the - prospect in that crop.
It is evident that the stock market is
sensitive to the- corn crop news and
anything decisive on that point would
be likely to have Important effect on
the Grangers.
United States Steel preferred was
sluggish during the greater part of
the day, but it was suddenly brought
into the advance and lifted to a new
high figure on the movement. Other
metal stocks and those of metal-con
suming companies also responded, in
cluding Amalgamated Copper. The
movement in Rock Island was- asso
ciated with the current reports that the
control of Chicago and Alton had been
picked up in the open market in the
Rock Island Interest. Chicago and Al
ton was .neglected and unaffected by
the story. The late upward movement
in sympathy with United States Steel
preferred made the closing strong. The
prospect of another weak bank return
was of little effect on the market.
' Bonds were active and firm. Total
sales, $6,210,000. United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
Then followed an ' intermission of
the races to permit of a contest be
tween a quartet of Court Acacia and
Court Southern Heights. . The first
prize of $20 was awarded to the first
named court, and the second, SI 2. to
the last named. The Acacia quartet
is composed of A. C Laurarice, Fred
erick Adams, George A. Gielow and
O. K. Brown. " ' *
This was followed by a short ad
dress on the "Day We Celebrate," by
High Treasurer Ed N. .Cameron, who,
at the close, presented to Junior Past
High Chief Ranger O. S. Cooper of
Vallejo a handsome and valuable em
blematic jewel voted him by the High
Court as a token of appreciation of
his services while high chief ranger.
After the distribution of the gate
prizes the races were resumed with
the following results:

and Lewis of Court Southern Heights.

to Shell Mound Purk this afternoon. The
register at the turnstile revealed that
there were nearly 2000 people within
the park, though the noise and mirth
cf the n:errymakers made it seem as if
there v.cre 4000 there. It was largely
a family affair, almost every father and
mother in the parish having gathered
up the little ones and taken them for
the outirff.
Â¦ There v\ere all sorts of things to
amuse the bis and little ones. Dancing
â¢went eo la the pavilion all day. In
a big Bummer-bouse there - were Jig
dajicarg: and various other informal
"j tunts." On the race track there were
trials for the many, from the fat man
to the boy under eleven years old.
Sixty prizes were given a\ray to the
â¢dinners of the competitions, the gifts
bavin? been donated by the business
men of the parish and the Fathers J.
F. Xugeat, C. E. O'Neile and Charles

That the picnio was aa unqualified

TILK EDITOR'S BRAI.V
Did Not Work Well UndÂ«-r Coffee.
A brain worker's health Is often in-
jured by coffee, badly selected food
and sedentary habits. The experience
of the Managing Editor of one of the
most prospr-rous newspapers In the
Middle West with Postum Food Cof-
fee illustrates the necessity of proper
f^edhiK for the man who depends on
hi? brain for a livlnr
"Up to three years ago." writes this
pentteman, "I was a heavy coffee
drinker. I knew it was Injuring me.
It directly affected my stomach and I
was threatened with chronic dyspep-
ela. It was then that my wife per-
euaded me to try _ Postum Food
Coffee. . The good results were - so
marked that I cannot say too much
for it. When first prepared I did not
fancy it. but inquiry developed the
fact that cook had not boiled it long
enough, so next time I had it properly
made and was charmed with it.
Since that time coffee has had no,
place on my table eave for guests,
r.oth myself and wife are fond of
this new cup which 'cheers but does
not inebriate* in a much truer and
fitKr sense than coffee. Jly stomach
has rftnimed its normal functions and
I am now well and strong again men-
tallyinnd physically."
"I |iin confident that coffee is a
npison to many, stomachs, and I have
recommended Postum with great suc-
cess to a number of my friends who
v.r^f silvering from. the use; of, cof-
fee." ..Name priven by Postum Co v

NEW YORK, Sept. 9. â There Is
reason to believe that, Alton B. Par-
Jeer will make arrangements to come
to New York City for temporary resi
dence as soon as his letter of accept
ance is made public. It is known that
leading Democrats have strongly pre
sented to him that his continued resi
dence at such ah inconvenient place
as Rosemount, with no hotel accom
modations, has kept Judge Parker
from personal contact ' with many
prominent men who are frequently in
New York City, but who have not time
for a trio to Esopus.

CHICAGO, Sept. 0.â At the opening of the
wheat market Ideal harvesting weather pre
vailing ' throughout the : spring- wheat country
counterbalanced the influence of higher cables,'
causing a somewhat easier tone. Initial quo
tations on December were unchanged to \ic
lower at $1 uÂ»U to $1 08%. Immediately after
the openinc the market experienced a sudden
advance as a result of a general demand for
May. On the up turn December rose to
ft O8TÂ», but the higher prices brought out
liberal realizing sales. The consequent''de
cline .was as. abrupt as had been the pre
vious advance. During the first half of the
section the price of the December option hov
ered around ?1 08. Although crop news from
the Northwest to-day was as bullish as ever,
the demand lacked the energy manifested of
late. The selling was in preparation for a
poepibie surprise when the Government figures
and crop ' reports are given out to-morrow. -
Tht- market closed fairly steady, with Decem
ber at ?1 08%. ? -
Excellent weather was perhaps the main cause
of a decline of nearly a cent from the' price of
corn. Another factor bearing on the situation
was the Intimation that .the Government report
to be Issued to-morrow would be of a bearish
character. ! The market closed almost at the
lowest point. December opened a shade higher
to JiofiT'ii: lower at 52VÂ«c to .*>2>ic and closed,
at 51V6@51%c. ?
For a brief period at the' opening the oats
market showed some firmness, but soon weak
ened In sympathy with other grains. During
the rreater part of the day trading was of
light volume. December opened a shade higher
at 33c, sold off to 32>Â£c and closed at the
bottom.
Provisions opened ' firm on buying for the
outside account, but later 'selling of pork by
the pit traders caused an easier tone. At the
close January pork was off 5c, lard closed
unchanged and ribs were a. pbade lower.

NEW YORK, Sept. 9. â Apparent
proof that insanity may be communi
cated like hydrophobia is shown in, a
case which is attracting much attenr
tion among physicians at Bellevue
Hospital. The subject is Nellie Hal
pin, a trained nurse, who was bitten
on the hand by an insane patient in
the King's County Sanitarium nearly
a year ago. Since then the wound
frequently has given MI$s Halpin
great pain and never completely
healed. About two months ago she
began to show signs of mental dis
turbance. These grew longer and
finally, her friends had the .young
woman removed from her h6me to
the ho3oital. She now suffers severe
convulsions resembling the manifesta
tions of rabies, while the mental de
lusions are almost continuous.

SALT LAKE, Utah, Sept 8. â By the
arrest "at Warrick, Mont., of a man
named Stevens the Salt Lake police
believe the murderer of W. A. Ver
million, who was killed in his -drug
store In this city on the night of Au
giist 22, is in custody. Stevens, it is
reported, has confessed his guilt and
has consented to return to Salt Lake
without extradition papers. Stevens'
arrest was the result of a long chase
by a Salt Lake newspaper man, fol
lowing a slender clew. Stevens, it was
learned, had been a constant borrower
of money from Vermillion and had dis
appeared suddenly the day after the
murder. He' was traced to
thence to Blackfoot, Idaho; Idaho
Falls and finally to a rar\ch near War
rick, Mont., where he was arrested.
The authorities. here have wired the
Sheriff of Silver Bow > County, Mon
tana, to hold Stevens on his arrival
there until an officer arrives from Salt
Lake. Vermillion, the. murdered man*
formerly lived in San Francisco.

*Tls not often the good fortune of a
bride to be wed In the same house
wherein her mother became a bride â
likewise on the anniversary of her
mother's wedding day.
But such was the tale of the Bund
schu-Slmras nuptials last night, cele
brated In the famous old home up on
Chestnut street, that has kept vigil
these many years. of the ships that slip
through the Golden Gate. There. In "the
big window of the library, beneath a
great bell of white sweet peas, the vows
were spoken, the Rev. Dr. Clampett
reading the service.
Always picturesque, the old home,
with its rambling balconies and ter
raced gardens, was 1 .beautiful in its
gala garb â with a forest of wood
wardlas, white asters and '. red carna
tions in the drawing-room, halls and
library. ' '
The bride was beautiful in an ex
quisite nuptial robe of white panne
satin and old lace, her tulle veil caught
with' a spray, of orange blossoms. On
her arm she" bore a shower of orchids.
She . was attended by Miss Alma
Bundshu as maid of honor, who was
charmingly gowned in white point
d'esprit, trimmed . with ribbon and
Valenclenes. Her bouquet was made
of pink Bridesmaid roses. The brides
maids, Miss Anita Hintz and Mrs.
A. B. C. Dohrmann, likewise were
smartly gowned. Miss Hintz wearing a
dainty frock of pale pink mulle and
Mrs. Dohrmann a heavy cream lace
robe over chiffon, both bearing pink
carnations, and a prettier bridal party
would be hard to conjure up.
â¢Mr. Slmms was served by Benjamin
Weed, the famous "Ben" Weed of the
University of California, who was laden
with laurels as an actor-man while at
college. As a support to ; the groom he
scored a famous success, having played
a leading part at a similar ceremony a
few years ago.QSBI Â¦>
During the reception â¢ supper was
served under the grafce -grown arbor,
which was agleam with mystic lights.
ThÂ« young people 'will leave to-day

Jealousy, engendered by^ a white
woman, was responsible for the shoot
ing of William Waldron, colored, by
a negro named Joseph Smith, better
known as "Sweety" Smith; at 205 Na
toma street at half -past 5 o'clock last
evening. The wounded man occupies
a cot at the Central Emergency Hos
pital, and the surgeons hold out but
little hope of his recovery. Smith fired
"rive shots at Waldron -while the latter
was sitting in a chair. Two of the bul
lets took effect, one entering the right
side and lodging in the lung, and the
other striking the breast bone and
glancing: off. Smith disappeared | be
fore the arrival of the police and is
now being eagerly sdught for by the
detectives.
Mrs. Mary Tull, the white woman in
the case, lives at 205 Natoma street
with her child and husband. Smith
and Waldron have occupied rooms in
the house for some time. Considerable
jealousy has existed between ' them
over Mrs. Tull and about a month ago
Smith fired 'a shot at Waldron, but
the bullet went wide of its mark. â¢
Last evening - Waldron borrowed a
blacking brush " of . Mrs. Tull's child.
While in Jthe kitchen shining his shoes
he spoke to - John Coldwell, another
roomer, about going Into the bootblack
business. According to ' Waldron's
statement Smith, who was In the room
occupied by Mrs. Tull, at this junc
ture rushed into the kitchen and with
out warning fired five shots. He then
turned and ran downstairs into the
street. .
Patrolmen J. J. Tillman and Bruce
were soon on the scene,. Dut were un
able to find a trace of Smith. Waldron
was removed to the hospital in the
ambulance and there attended by Dr.
C. G. Wilson. Late last night an op
eration was. performed by Chief Sur
geon Stephen, assisted by Dr. C. Ai
Glover. A dying statement was se
cured by Deputy District Attorney
Ward. Detective Harry Braig is
searching the city for Smith. Waldron
is a cook and Smith is employed in a
barber shop at 628 Post street.
Detectives searched for Smith at his
various haunts, but "were unable to
find him up to a late hour last night.
They believe he has left town, as he
had a start of three hours on the po
lice.

The Commuters have finally taken
on the gait that wins. Twice yesterday
did they make the Seals look like so
many codfish. They outfielded 'em,
outhit 'era and outhotfooted 'em on the
bars. The morning game ended 2 to 1
and it was a clean . coat of the old
white paint in the afternoon, 2 to 0.
Both victories were legitimate ones
and the kind that count. It was due
to the grand pitching of Graham and
Schmidt that Uncle Hank took that
double ride on the toboggan. Unlucky
errors by San Francisco brc-ke up both
games. Wheeler, Gorton and Goch
nauer being the arch offenders.
Schmidt twisted the elusive ones over
the pan in the afternoon game Just as
he used to do for Brooklyn. He had
perfect command of the ball and his
curves were puzzlers to the Seals in
every Inning. Whalen was right be
hind him and possibly twirled just as
good a game, but the errors broke up
his chances and robbed â¢ him of much
glory.
The Oakland team played the game
like the real article of champs. They
started with a run in the second spasm
when Gochnauer's bad throw to first
gave Streib a life. Devereaux pushed
one into right field and Streib took
third. Gochnauer made a perfect re
turn to the plate of Byrnes' drive, but
Gorton failed to glim the leather and
the run was safe. Immediately after,
McKune hit to Van Buren and after
putting his man out at first Van caught
Devereaux slumbering and completed
a pretty double.
The Seals had their only chance in ;
the sixth and then they failed. With
two in the well, Anderson tore off a
double to left. Gorton sprung through
with a drive to the Eame spot, but
Dunleavy's magnificent throw on a
line to the plate caught "Wooden
Shoes" five feet from his destination
and dashed the hopes of the admirers
of the home team.
Oakland managed to top It off with
one more in the final round. Ganley
hit for two, but Dunleavy forced Kim
at third on a bad bunt. Dun immedi
ately stole second and then tore for
third. Gorton tossed the ball away
over Irwin's head and Dun meandered
home. Meany let drive a nice double
to right in the Seals' half of the ninth,
but no one had the hit to bring him
home. The score:

part .of ..the .seconds year. -.-By -taking advan
tage of the law, locator agents may hold- a
large number, of claims for nearly two years,
which are. taken for speculative purposes onjy
The purpose of .the law Is to foster and pro
mote "the* mining' industry 'and" to secure the
development of the mineral lands of the United
States territory, while -protecting: the- claim
holder in the' possession of the claims.
Looking at it broadly, it seems to matter
little whether the lands are held by a large
number; of Individuals or by a smaller num
ber who : control large, holdings, so long as
the 'law is ' complied with; but in- many-in
stances neither the individual holder of a, large
number of claims nor tbc wealthy corporate
owner of Â¦ an equal -. number â¢ of claims actually
complies with the lawâ the one from Inability
the other from disinclination.' -
. Th> United States statutes fix the minimum
of requirement, â¢ and the several States and
Territories may add additional requirements
Â« s wrt of the act of location â such, for
Instance, : as the- performance -of- a - certain
amount or work within stipulated time, as
ninety days In Arizona. Alaska Is not a Ter
ritory and has no. legislature, and therefore
legislation of this 'character cannot be-en
acted within thÂ».t district: .but Congress may
make laws controlling the disposal of Alaska's
mineral - lands, Â¦ and I the wholesale Â¦ taking; of
claJmu .by agents- who perform â¢ no work 'is a
matter deserving of Congressional . attention.
POINTERS FOR MIXERS.
Giffbrd I Pihchot,'; chief -of the â¢ Bureau
of -Forestry of 'the: Department of Ag
riculture, took .trouble, .at .the American
Mining Congress, . to clear up .â¢ some
misapprehensions concerning the intent
.of < the . reserve .' policy,, of '.the
Government as related, to the mining
industry. . An? extract - from-'/; his. ' re
marks "is , as follows:. ; . - , .' ;
1 The'- President's j Idea in creatinr the'^Publlc
Lands Commission ' is 'to sret' at the best - way
of uslns .and preserving: â¢ the public lands "of
the ' United. /States,- and. 'particularly .of j the
western ; part of > tbe , country.'- 'The question
now Is, Â¦ VHow,,can- we. tive the forested part
of the. public, lands, their best' use?" /Â¦'. The
lumbermen want Â¦ the r forests reserved In order
that â¢ their .Industry , may .bÂ« â¢ preserved. The
grazing man wants the forests thrown, open
to grazing, and also wants the; grass as well
as i the -forest* -'for ;htmself. As to the min
ing Industry, - you - cannot - run a mine without
timber \and Â« water, ,and both' must . be .hear
and" cheap. --"The policy of the " Government
toward ' the m Inln e man |s to get the timber
near enough for him : to operate â¢ his. mine , at
a profit. ;,O^\.of. the .misconceptions of the
law Â¦ creating . forest â¢ reserves ' is that - it pre
vents * the .location and development of 'mining
lands.' â¢ Tou^cin .develop mines ' in forest re
serves the' same as- you "can 1 elsewhere.'. You

The State Mineralogist has [ issued â¢ a
report v concerning the mineral output
of California In 1903, the' first complete
and official figures at handi. With, this
report is a bulletin that makes it pos
sible to compare.the California" mineral
returns for seventeen years in detail/
from 1887 to 1903, inclusive of both
years. ' . . - Â¦
Naturally- the first- interest -will, be
regarding the gold product of -the State
in 1903. This amounted to i $16,471,264.
Nevada. County kept its position as* the
leading gold producing county of Cali
fornia. . Its gold output was $2,458,047.
Amador County yielded $1,609,744 in
gold;. Butte County, its product being
largely swelled by the operations of
the gold dredging machines, $1,571,507;
Calaveras County, $1,904,125; El Do

Intf resting are the comparative fig
ures of mineral output in 1903. and; 1902.
Taking' all mineral substances together,
including those that are non-metallic,
the oils, the structural materials, etc.,
California â¢ shows an increase ; in - total
mineral output for 1903 that amounts
to more than $2,000,000. The total: for
1903 is $37.759,040,"'as compared, with
$35,069,105 in.. the preceding year. 1 ; The
mineral countfcs areled, in the .matter
of total output, .by Kern County,
which is credited with $4,957,602.: .The
second place is held by Shasta County,
with $3,201,680 as its total product. Los
Angeles is third with $2,549,128; Nevada
County fourth with $2,466,044; Cala
veras, fifth with $2,270,668; Tuolumne
sixth with $1,791,056; Amador' seventh
with $1,639,819; 'Butte eighth with $1,
581,325; San Bernardino ninth with $1,
516,618; Orange tenth with $1,029,435.
These are the only counties above the
$1,000,000 class. / . . ;
Miners of a few years ago would have
been surprised to see the mining coun
ties of California arranged. in this or
der in matter of total production. Cop
per has given the, primacy to a north
ern county. .Oil is now giving it to. a
southern : county, coupled with a re
spectable output of precious and other
minerals. . ; t ;
In this' connection the totals for oil
production in, various counties 'are; of
interest, as returned for 1903. Of Kern's
total of $4,957,602, petroleum amounted
to $3,600,230. Los Angeles produced a
value in petroleum of $1,294,866.. Orange
County's I petroleum was worth $1,016,
285. Ventura's petroleum product was
$517,611. The . petroleum product of
seven counties. amounted in value t to
$7,313,271. 'Fresno County is credited
with' $730,673, ; Santa Clara County pro
duced some petroleum, the total value
being $3966. -; â¢
VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. â¢
Values of various mineral products, of
California in â¢ 1903, of leading Â¦ impor
tance, include"^ $2,520,997 . -for ." copper,
$1,237,419 for rubble, $1,335,954 for quick
silver, $592,268. for .lime and limestone,
$678,670 for granite, $503,659 for .asphalt,
$661,400- for borax. $968,727 for cement,

$75,237 for natural gas, $211,365 for, salt,
$585,309 for sandstone, $51,744 ' for silver.!
The prominence that structural;mater
ials are assuming. In the total'output of
the State is notfceable.
The variations of the gold production
for seventeen years- are* indicated and
they are interesting. Taking the seven
teen years that; the State Mineralogist
has selected for purposes of compari
son it Â¦. will be . found that . in,- this series
of years the gold production -of I Cali
fornia was greatest - in 1896, when ' the
total value was- $17,18i;562. , The gold
