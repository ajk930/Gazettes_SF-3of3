morning and afternoon . in the pic
turesquely ; decorated . auditorium at
Golden : Gate Hall. All the officers of

Nature placed an additional obstacle j
In the shape of the weather in the path j
of the Knights Templar drill corps that
ttrived yesterday at Golden Gate Park i
for the rich trophies offered to stirau- |
lete their efforts, but withal the com- i
petition was the most picturesque '
event witnessed since the conclave was !
inaugurated. The victory of Louisville
brought forth a tremendous cheer that
attested the fairness of the judges. This j
has been a notable festival and pleasant
memories have been born with each
passing hour, but yesterday's contest,
when splendidly-drilled crusaders of
peace strained for coveted honors be
neath a broiling sun, .while. great multi
tudes applauded, supplied a dramatic
culmination tfiat fulfilled to the highest
degree the anticipation of the people. â¢
J The first of the many excursions
"planned for conclave .week were given,
yesterday and furnished a pleasant re
laxation from fraternal duties to.thou-;

and friends. The Cliff House and beach

thousands that sought entertainment

packed Hazard's Pavilion' to the^iimlt

That he was pleased was Indicated by
the fact that after the meeting, weary
as he was from, a -day's, hard work, he
beamed with pleasure and stated .that
the demonstration, was one of' the
greatest which he has seen during his
tour* of .the West.
'The most important thing about the
initial rally of the campaign is that it
sets at rest all fears that the Repub
licans of Los Angeles County are
apathetic and that they will take, the
re-election of President Rposeyelt as
a foregone conclusion and ' therefore
refrain from doing their political
duties as citizens. 'Â¦
The distinguished visitor arrived
early this morning on the Owl and
was met by a reception j committee
composed of some of the most' promi
nent members of " the party in' this
section of the State. ' The morning
was spent showing him the city and
in -'an entirely.- informal reception, at
which he met the- party leaders of
Southern California. V "â¢'Â¦'' â¢ â¢
In the afternoon he went to Pasa

set for the evening meeting at the
pavilion. Escorted by the Columbia
Marching Club of Santa Ana and ac
companied by prominent citizens
without ' reference to their Â¦/*' political
faiths, Secretary Shaw was (Jriven in
an open carriage from his hotel to the
place of meeting, the route being
through the' principal streets of the
city. Arrived at the pavilion the
party found it difficult to enter.
The streets were lined with people
and the building was packed. ' A larger
crowd never attended a political meet
ing'or other function there.. Upon the
stage were' seated the vice presidents of
the evening and even their rights to
the distinction of holding : such ' seats
were not regarded by the crowd which
encroached upon the rear of the. stage
to make room tori those behind them.

Both the Russian and Japanese ac
counts seem to agree in saying that
until the withdrawal of the main Rus
sian army from Liaoyang commenced,
Kuropatkin had beaten oft the Japa
nese assaults in front of Liaoyang and
that the Russian commander-in-chief's
first movement against Kuroki also
was measurably successful.
No further details of the losses suf
fered by the Russians during the ten
days* fighting have been received. How
long the roll of casualties ultimately
will be can be estimated by the official
report of the number of officers killed
or wounded between August 26 and Au
gust 31 In a single division. This di
vision, that of General Kc-ndratsvltch,
which is under General Zaroubaiefl*.
and which formed part of the Russian
right below Liaoyang, lost twelve offi
cers killed, thirty-five wounded and one
missing.

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 7.â As the
Russian newspapers begin to realize
more fully the catastrophe which
General^ Kuropatkin avoided at Liao
yang and the skillful manner in which
he upset Field Marshal Oyama's plan
to surround the Russian army, they
take a more cheerful view of the result
and are beginning to bestow upon
Kuropatkin great praise.
It is now apparent that Oyama's pur
: pore in pressing the Russian positions
1 in front c-f Liaoyang was to hold
Kuropatkin's attention while the Japa
nese right v.ing was thrust .around the
Russian rear to block the Russian line
of retreat. But Kuropatkin, at its very
inception, had his eyes upon this flank
ing movement, and countered by early
withdrawing his main army to the
right bank of the Taitse River, chang
ing his front to meet and hold General
Kuroki in check while General Zarc-u
baleff's corps at Liaoyang crossed,
burning the bridges behind him and
placing the river between him and Gen
eral Oku.

With great presence of mind and
courage the drivers of the hose wagon
and engine saved the horses by. driv
ing them right through the doors of
the building after hastily hitching one
engine and hose wagon. The other, a
new engine, recently purchased at a
cost qf 55000, was lost, also the hook
and-ladder chemical engine and the
greater part of the hose. An extra sup
ply of hose was obtained from Kern
and assistance called for from Fresno.
Then the electric power was shut off
and the water supply gave out almost
entirely for lack of power for the en
gines. With their single engine the
firemen did their best, but their efforts
were unavailing.
Iri a few minutes the entire row of
brick buildings on Nineteenth street
were ablaze. Including the fine three
story Midland block. Leaping across
Twentieth street the flames seized two
brick" buildings and from there at
tacked a row of frame buildings, all
of which were totally destroyed. The
heat was' terrific and the flames quickly
attacked the Windsor Hotel. This
was a frame building and from it
the fire " attacked Rjche's Opera
house, a brick building, belonging to
the Bank of Bakersfleld, and not used
for several years. Both these were
destroyed. From there the fire seriously
menaced the large department store of
Hochhelmer & Co. and the Conklin
block on Chester avenue. The fire,
burned itself out by 4 o'clock and the
request for the Fresno engines was
countermanded.
BAKERSFIELD, Sept. !7.â To-night
three entire blocks of the' city are in
ruins, two men are dead and a third
may not recover and the loss finan
cially will probably reach 1250,000, with
about $100,000 insurance at the outside.
The fire started at 2:10 o'clock this
afternoon in the engine-house of the
Bakersfleld Fire Department. William
Silver, a brick mason, well known in
the city, entered the place in an In
toxicated, condition and jay down to
sleep. It is supposed that he was smok
ing: and he started the rtre from his
cirrar. His charred remains were re
covered after the fire.- They were ut
terly unrecognizable.
The engine-house was a frame shack,
long since condemned. The Trustees
had received bids for its sale and re
moval preparatory to the erection of a
brick building. It burned like dry
tinder. It was surrounded on all sides
by frame shacksâ veritable fire trapsâ
and in a few seconds these were all
ablaze. The flames spread north and
south on K street to Twentieth and
Nineteenth, and In the rear to Jap al

ST. PETERSBURG, Thursday, SÂ«pt.
S. 2:02 a. in.â The General Staff is not
displaying great anxiety over the
alarmist reports that General Kuropat
kin is in serious danger of being cut
off, but if they had any information
from the front on Wednesday they
have not revealed it. The members
also decline to say, even if they know,
whether General Kuropatkin purposes
taking his army north of Mukden. An
officer of the General Staff said last
night: .
"I believe it is safe to say that Gen
eral Kuropatkin's army Is now out of
danger. Our advices since Monday in
dicate that the fighting is of an Insig
nificant character and I do not believe
that the tired Japanese troops are ca
pable of seriously threatening the line
of retreat. The greatest difficulty our
army is now having to contend with is
the terrible roads, owing to the rain of
Monday and Tuesday.
"Our information is that the bulk of
the baggage has already passed
through MukdA. This is the usual
procedure in case of any retreat."
Kuropatkin's movements, after all,
must depend chiefly on the tactics of
the Japanese, with whom lies the ini
tiative. If the Japanese continue to
press northward in trie hope of cutting
off the Russians and bringing them to
bay, then Kuropatkin will be obliged
to move northward to circumvent them.
But both armies already are terribly
exhausted and if they again come into
grip the result will depend largely upon
which of them is able to throw the
most fresh reserves into the fight.
If there is a race northward it is ap
parent that the greatest danger will
come at the narrow defile of Tlehling.

CHIXESE GROW. RESTLESS.
Become More Anti-Russian as the
Japanese Advance.
1 MUKDEN, .Sept. 7.â A correspond-
ent has just arrived, here after a jour
ney covering a', distance of -120 miles,
from Sintsintln, east of Mukden, and
says that during the .latter- part of his
journey he could hear the fighting at
I.iaoyang. The correspondent says: .
. "The whole country; Is -aflame with
the wildest and most contradictory ru
mors. The principal interest in the
situation is in the fact that the Chi
nese population is: becoming more
anti-Russian with the advance of the
Japanese army.
"Mukden itself is overcrowded and
it is almost impossible to get food or
a place to sleep. . Everywhere there
is the greatest uproar and confusion
and many families are leaving In the
direction, of Harbin.. The soldiers,
however, are not at all disheartened
at the result of the fight and they say
that the Japanese losses are- so tre
mendous as to seriously weaken them.
They declare that they have made the
Japanese pay infiintely more for Liao
yung than it was worth."
At 9 o'clock of the evening of the
29th a Russian regiment made a sud
den onslaught on the Japanese trenches
and at the point . of the bayonet the
Japanese were forced back to redoubt
No. 2. The Russians were unable to
proceed farther .than this redoubt,be
cause of the fierce flr^ poured in upon
them by the Japanese. According to
the comment by the Novi Krai this
redoubt had evidently .been greatly
strengthened during the previous night.
On the east flank the remainder of
the night of the 29th was quiet. Noth
ing occurred on the west flank during
the night of the 29th.
On the' morning of August 30 Rus
sian artillery dispersed a small body
of Japanese cavalry.
A Japanese torpedo-boat recently
flred on the Tiger's Tail fort. She. was
found by searchlights and repulsed by
Russian batteries. She appeared to be
somewhat damaged.
On the evening of the 29th the Japa
nese opened a heavy flre from Fort No.
3 and other points, directing their
larger, guns chiefly at the Russian posi
tions : on a hil! called the Small Eagle's
Nest." At Shushiyen the Japanese re
moved the roofs from a number of
Chinese houses, strongly constructed of
mud and stone, and converted them
into excellent redoubts.
Another reconnoitering party found
the Japanese vanguard trenches at
Shushiyen to be unoccupied. The Rus
sians remained in the trenches a while
and presently discovered a company of
Japanese troops. There was an ex
change of rifle fire, during which a
number of the Japanese, who had been
surprised, were killed. The remainder
retired. . .
CHEFU. Sept. 7.â It Is is now ap
parent that the heavy fighting re
ported'by numerous Chinese refugees
as having occurred before Port Arthur
between August 27 and 31 occurred
chiefly on the first two days mentioned,
the Japanese thereafter directing their
efforts almost entirely to holding the
positions â¢ they . had obtained. That
these positions were of considerable im
portance is evidence'd by the fact that
the Russians risked the lives of valu
able men in open fighting in their ef
forts to dislodge the Japanese from
them. As has been previously reported
In these dispatches, the Japanese troops
retired from 'nearly all points on the
morning of August 31.
The Novi Krai of August 31 devoted
considerable space to an account of a
small Russian _ reconnaissance which
started from Palungshan and reached
a point near Shushiyen without en
countering - any Japanese. Returning
to, their own lines jon the night of the
29th, thTs party came upon a trench in
an open field garrisoned by a solitary
Japanese soldier, who abandoned his
rifle and fled upon seeing the Rus
sians. . The Russians captured some
trenching tools, but they discovered
the Japanese In force behind r. barrier
thrown .across the Mandarin road and
returned swiftly to the fjortress.
There is little news from the Far East, either from Russian or Japanese sources. For
the world watchers of the great tragedy the curtain has been dropped and all is conjecture. Not
even an expression of opinion conies from Japanese sources, but from St. Petersburg
it is indicated that the authorities are confident the critical stage of the Russian retreat is past
and that Kuropatkin no longer is in danger of losing any part of his forces to the pursuing Jap
anese. The Russian commander has arrived at Mukden, and it is given out in St. Peters
lwrg that the bulk of his army is near there, while a dispatch from Mukden, filed on Thurs
day, says that the main Russian army is pushing northward and evacuating that place. It is
indicated that the Japanese arc still harassing the Russian rear. Further than this nothing is
/known. An absolute news silence prevails. N

The Daily Tclt-graph holds that the
latest developments are merely the
prelude to the â¢'colossal conflict loom
ins in the future."
Mort of the English critics look for
s. repetition of the Liaoyang battle at
Tiohlir.g. or in that neighborhood.
Scarcely any London newspapers
believe that Kuropatkin has brought
the bulk of his forces with him to
Mukden. It is pointed out that neither
fide is likely to risk the desecration
of the imperial tombs by a pitched
battle at Mukden, the cradle of the
Manchu dynasty and the Mecca of all
good Manchus. :t is believed, will be

The Morning Post, though confes
sedly unable to sum up the situation,
owing to the absence of Japanese of

Being armed "with his 1 badge of au

that any crook would be bold enough

His diamond scarfpin, valued at $150,
was gone. , Then' it occurred . to him
that the three men who jostled against
him on the car at Third and; Market

ST. BERNARD IS SNAPPY.
The crack St. Bernard Commandery
Drill Corps came on almost at a quick
step. Precision and rapidity marked
their every movement. "Snappy," the
crowd remarked.
But it was soon perceptible that the
St. Bernard Commandery was going
through different evolutions than its"
two predecessors. Then the whisper
went around that the St. Bernard
corps had secured a special dispensa
tion to drill under its own tactics. They
went through evolutions that they had
practiced lor years. ' ;^% â¢'
Quickly, almost hurriedly, but with
perfect precision and certainty of every
move they did their work.
The difference between the St. Ber
nard corps and that of Louisville wa3
almost the same as that between the
northern and the southern tempera
ment, the one deliberate and graceful,
the other sharp and precise. By ac
clamation and by the judges* decision
the Southrons triumphed over the best
of the North.

When Ivanhoe Commandery of Mil
waukee appeared their delegation burst
into the unique yell:
"Ivanhoe! Ivanhoe!
Three times three! -Â¦Â¦
Ivanhoe! Ivanhoe!
Mil-wau-kee!"
The Ivanhoe Templars were given
the third award.
METHOD OF SCORING.
Following are the results, with the
official scores: Louisville Command
ery, 779.54; St. Bernard, 771.14; Ivanhoe,
725.03; Malta, 655.82.
The average was made on a basis of
3 points for every, movement, making a
total of 810. The three army officers In
charge simply computed impartially,
according to their own estimates.
Before the awards were announced
the four competing commanderies
marched around the field in battalion
formation. Then there was anxiety
among the Kentucky delegation.
In the judges', tent sat 'the stern
judges and they decreed that none
should hear their deliberations. They
emerged and quietly but firmly re
fused to tell who had won.
"This is â¢ awful, the suspense,"' re
marked one of the blue grass beau
ties. sOh,' if those Yankees win after
all our hopes and troubles!"
The competing corps swung round
in battalion front. Sir Knight Rickton,
chairman of the drill committee, step
ped to- the front and center. In the
midst of a dead silence he said:
CALJFOKNIAXS DRILL.
"The judges have given their decis
ion, t I trust that all will be satisfied
with it. Louisville wins."
The rebel yell started again and the
entire assemblage took it up. At the
commanderies the Kentucky girls
started "My Old Kentucky Home" once
more. The blue grass belles waited till
their Sir Knights were dismissed and
t nen _verily It is pleasant to be a mem
ber of a winning corps. The Southern
girls know how. to congratulate.
When the competing commanderle3
had been dismissed the drill corps of
Sacramento went through some beauti
ful evolutions. They formed stars,
squares, crosses and double crosses,
never losing the rythmic cadence of
their step.'
Many remarked that if hospitality
had permitted the Los Angeles Knights
to enter the .competition . they would
have stood a fine chance to win. Theirs
was purely an exhibition drill.
Golden Gate Commandery's drill
corps â¢ turned out with the following
members: Colonel W. Edwards, com
mander; Major George Filmer, senior
warden;; Thomas Trebell, junior war
den-; Robert Ashe, Dr. P..F. Alden, W.

/.While the Golden Gate Sir. Knights
were drilling the California Command
ery's mounted, corps dashed into the
amphitheater. The splendid black
horses were so anxious to show them
selves that their riders were unable
to hold them back.
/â¢A 'drill by this splendid body wound
up the programme.
The banquet tendered to the most
eminent grand master, officers and
members of the Grand Uncampment, .
Knights Templar of the United States
of America, at the Ht. Francis last
night was the crown of the hospital- |
ity that has distinguished the con- j
clave. The beautiful white and gold j
dining hall of the great hotel was ra- i
diant with its wealth of electric j
lights, enhanced by a marvelous flo- ;
ral display, ralms of huge propar- j
tions fell in graceful profusion from ;
the gallery, while about the side walls j
were banners emblematic of the dif- |
ferent commandcries and great clus
ters of rare and beautiful flowers.
The long tables were decked with .
American Beauty roses and clusters j
of luscious grapee. while at intervals
were Masonic designs.

I thank you moot kindly for drinking to the
tuast of the priory of England and Wale*. I
bring from this priory a greeting of brotherly
love lo the Kir Knights of your country. Your
hon)itallty has been unbounded. I have Jour
neyed acre*:* your country in a most comfort
able manner. Everywhere I have received hos
pitality and Irtnda*â. I take back with me*
an Idea of the greatness of America. We can
not gne >ou in England anything like the
magnificent pageant of yesterday, for we have i
only 2OWÂ» members of cur order there, but
when you come to visit us these 2000 will all
extend io you the same magnificent hospitality
that ycur great hocts have extended to us here
in this grand conclave. (.Cheers.) ',
The turns chivalry that exists here permeates
our own order at home. I want to ccme here
again and se* you all once more. We are very
fond cf you en our side of the water. We
want you to cross the herring pond and come
and visit ve.
I want to make a little remark about tho I
fcpaniEh-American War. While this war was *
in its Jnciplency there was a little island that i
Â»M a friend of yours, and this little iy'.and
eatd a few words to the other powers, the pur
port of .which wai that you should be left to
fight the battle out yourselves. (Cheers.)
Now In closing I want to thank you all for
your kindness and may the bonds of union be
tween uÂ» become closer and clos-er. (Loud and
repeated cheer*.)
Sir "W. B. Melisk was fully in accord
with his subject, "The Ladies." This
toast was introduced in a masterly
manner by R. H. Lloyd, who paid a
glowing tribute to women. Sir Knight
Melish. in his reply, mentioned two j
samples of beautiful womanhood, the Â¦

It was rumored last night about the
corridors of several hotels that the
selection of the next meeting place
had been made and., that .Saratoga
Springs, N. Y., had been, decided uppn.
It was also said that some of the com
manderies had already begun to ar
range their itineraries for their home
cities to Saratoga in preparation for a
trip during the next triennial. ,
It is announced that the grand mas
ter of England, the Right Honorable
the Earl of Euston, and the other high
officers of. the Great Priory will -be in
attendance to-day in the gorgeous coÂ»
tumes of their order and will , be . es
corted to their places by officers of the
Grand Encampment In full 'dress uni
form. .
At the afternoon session will be de
cided the important question of where
the next conclave' will be held. There
are several commanderies in the field
desiring to have it held in their home
towns, but so far Saratoga Springs, N.
Y., and Chicago, III., seem to', have the
leading chances of success. It Is pos
sible, however, that a dark horse may
develop when the question comes up for
a final decision.
It is understood that there are many
who would be glad to receive this
honor and the chance of promotion to
the highest places in Templardomthat
it carries with it. , Unless some unex
pected hitch occurs, all officers will be
elected tc--day at the. morning session.

be filled by the present grand junior

tion and election of an officer from the

of grand prelate and all offices sub
ordinate thereto do not â¢ advance - in

George W. Arper presented a set of
resolutions adopted by the Merchants*
Exchange objecting to the outlay of
$300,000 and advocating the construc
tion of an ordinary county road upon
the survey of the proposed boulevard.
E. P, Flint also opposed the building
of the boulevard, contending that the
cost of construction would not be Justi
fied by the benefit received.
. -At the close -of these arguments Ed-'
win Stearns, of the 'Oakland
Board of Trade, presented a resolution
from that body heartily favoring the
construction of the boulevard. Mr.
Stearns also made a brief address along
the same lines. Hugh Hogan, Stuart
Booth and M. J. Keller, members of
the committee from the Board of
Trade, also indorsed the proposed im
provement.
Among the opponents of the proposed
road were Dr. E. R. Tait, representing
the Alameda County Advancement As
sociation; George W. Arper, represent
ing the Merchants' Exchange, and E.
P. Flint. Dr. Tait, when called upon
by Chairman John Mitchell, stated that
the members* of the organization of
which he was the rep'resentative were
of the opinion that. the. expense of
further improving the foothill road
should be borne by the residents of the
district through which the road is to
be built. Dr. Tait said that under the
proposed conditions about $240,000 of
the $300,000 would be contributed by
Oakland. Alameda- and Berkeley, the
communities least to be benefited.
The Bpard of Supervisors to-day lis
tened to the arguments for and against
the scenic boulevard between Oakland
and Haywards and finally decided to
build the roadway upon the lines ori
ginally proposed, and awarded the con
tract to the Ransome Construction
Company at $300,000. 'The vote/ was
unanimous. ! -\ .

And It was through Professor Putnam
that the Rumsey collection. was gath

at that time was carried on by the late

and subsequently a great number of
relics were purchased by Mr. Rumsey.

Pretty Violet Fife at high noon yes
terday became the brlda of Law
rence Foster, and a lovelier brida haÂ»
seldom been seen. St. Paul's was gay
with palms and green things from th*
forest, and the man aisle was spanned â¢
with a trellis of ferns and pink and
purple asters, rivaling in color the) bril
liant gleams from" the noonday sun
streaming through the cathedral win- .
dows In the chancel.
Before an altar abloom with ferns
and St. Joseph lilies and agleam with
scores of yellow light. the> Rtv. Mr.
Reilly read the service.
The bride was attended by . her
Titian-haired sister Beatrice, who worÂ»
a frock of pink chiffon over whits
satin, the skirt and bodice* outlined
with pink rosebudsâ a Parisian conceit,
this pink setting for red hair, and Â«*â¢
suredly stunning. Fenton Foster at
tended the groom.
The bride's robe was of wavy satin
and rose point- lace, fit close to her
slight figure. 8hÂ« wore a long tulle
veil and carried a shower bouquet of
lilies-of-the- valley.
f After the service ajreception was held
at the home of the bride's mother on
California street, where the decora
tions were in keeping with the glad
event, rivaling the church in color ef
fect.
The young people left last night for
the Eastâ presumablyâ the guess
being based on circumstance. Later
they will set up their household goods
in a fine home Just over the way from
the parental firesideâ the splendid gilt
of Mrs. Fife.
At her home on Baker street, Misa
Aimee Van Winkle last night became
the bride of Earnest A. Lee, the Rev.
H. S. Thomas officiating.
The drawing-room, where the service
was performed, became a miniature
garden for the night, the bridal pair
standing beneath a bower of wood
warded and white carnations.
The winsome bride was attended by
Miss Sarah Van Winkle as honor maid,
and Miss. Martha Lee as bridesmaid.
The groom was attended by Louis Cau
doin.
| The bride, who Is a lineal descendant
of Lady Jane Grey, and grandniece of
Edmund Burke, bears much of the
beauty of her illustrious ancestors, and
in her bridal robe of white crepe and
Irish point she was never prettier.
After the wedding a reception was
held, to which only relatives and a few
close friends were bidden.

The war" between the vaccinationista
and the anti-vaccinationista goes brisk
ly on. As soon as one side makes a
move the other advances to offset it.
Last niÂ«ht the Board of Education
passed a resolution declaring: that all
physicians' certificates excusing chil
dren from% vaccination on account of
ill health must be first approved by
the health officer. This the antl-vac
cinationists considered a reflection on
the honor of their physicians, and so
they propose to make things interesting 1
by suing somebody for damages for the
death of Myrtle Conklin. the child
whose death a week ago followed an
operation for vaccination.
The board's resolution was suggested
by the talk among antl-vacclnationists
that their friends among the doctors
would issue disability certificates for
the asking. As several hundred such
certificates were filed the directors grew
suspicious and fixed matters so that
the law could not be evaded.
The school directors acted on this
resolution while their president, Dr. W.
W. Allen, who is also president of the
first anti-compulsory vaccination
league, was absent. This action, more
than anything else, aroused the anti
vacclnationists to anger and through
the executive committee of the Anti-
Compulsory Vaccination League they
promulgated the' following resolution,
designed to make trouble for somebody,
and especially for the Board of Educa
tion:
Whereas, There have beÂ«n a number Â©Â£
deaths In our vicinity which are due directly
to. vaccination, and especially In the case of
Myrtle Conklin; therefore, be It
Resolved. That It is the sense of this com
mittee that legal advice be obtained to deter
mine where lies the responsibility for the death
of said Myrtle Conklin. It Is also the sense
of this committee that a suit for damages be
Instituted against the responsible parties and
also that the constitutionality of the compul
sory vaccination law be tested, so that If there.
Is any way of protecting the lives of our chil
dren we may ascertain the way.

'JA1NESVILLE, Va., Sept. 7.â With j
â¢ uiitinuuuE fighting since S o'clock on |
e defense line established by General
BeU last night, hostilities were stopped |
by General Corbin at noon to-day in J
order that the men, who had been on j
the firing line for practically thirty-six;
hours, might be relieved. 'â¢
Just before the recall was sounded \
Colonel Wagoner, umpire, sustained the i
advance of the blue army practically ';
through General Bell's left wing. This ;
â¢Aould grive the advantage to the blue*
array on Its face, but there are many j
other points to be taken into considera- j
tion, which may have a bearing on the â¢
result.
Besides this final movement a battle
Tias fought throughout the morning, in
Â¦which two brigadea of the blue ham
mered one and a half brigades of brov.-n
just to the north of the final flanking
movement. Besides having a superior
force, the blue army masked a strong
battery, consisting of twenty guns,
Â¦which commanded the brown defense
line on each side, occupied by a slip
of woods, and fought over a space of
about â¬00 yards, which sloped down in
the center. Time after time the blue
army ventured out into the open, only
to be ruled back by the chief umpire.
Tu ice hostilities were stopped that de
cisions might be rendered. With the
exception of the hissing noise of the
bullets and the shriok of the shells
The roar of battle was reproduced.
A daring attempt was made last
night to capture General Bell -in his
headquarters at Thoroughfare Gap. The
capture was not made, because General
Bell heard of the plan and literally
took up his bed and walked. He se-
â¢ reted himself in a farmhouse near by
and slept until morning. The capture
as planned by a scouting party and
â¢would undoubtedly have been success
ful had not General Bell made his es
cape in time.

The policeman went on to tell of
how the trio resisted arrest, how he
was compelled to use first his hand

defense, how he was finally forced to
blow his whistle for aid. Testimony
for the defense was so overwhelming
ly against the officer, however, that
the case was dismissed.

for the second time was convicted of

In the court o^f Police Judge Ca
baniss yesterday morning the cases of
Watkins and Grady were continued.
Detective Kindelon expects to have
the list of defendants augmented be
fore the week is out.
Joseph ,. Watkins and John Grady
were the men captured. A purse was
stolen from a woman and J. W. Dance,
butcher, residing at 120 Railroad ave
nue South, found the plunder In
Grady's possession. Grady said that
the purse had been placed in his
pocket by Watkins and when the
butcher undertook to arrest both of
them the fight be'gan. Detective Kin
delon attempted to handcuff Watkins
and Grady and a stranger hit him
on the head with a pistol. Then the
battle became general â the detective
and Butcher Dance arrayed against a
dozen armed thugs. Pistol3 were brand
ished in the officer's face and he was
kicked and thumped and threatened,
but, like a bulldog, he stuck to his
prisoners until the train rolled into
Ocean View. There the would-be res

less and left the train. >

that he captured, after flÂ»e toughest
fight he ever had, wore headgear of
the kind described and the dozen or so
who tried to effect their rescue were
similarly hatted. There may have been
nothing extraordinary in the uniform
ity of shape and /.olor of those hats,
but the detective thinks otherwise.
Fred J. Hurat of 1647 Mission street
and his wife were admiring the illum
ination at Kearny and Geary streets
when a bystander saw a young fellow
abstract Sir. Hurat's watch from its
fob and walk away with it. The citizen
immediately notified Mr. Hurat, who
followed the young fellow and found
the watch In his hand. Placldlo Gomez
Valencia was the name given. by the
thief and he will be tried before Judge
Mogan to-day. s
"Chick" Malone, colored, pleaded not
guilty of vagrancy and professed ina
bility to explain how he came to be
called "Chick." He never had any
other name and could not tell whether
"Chick" had been formally conferred
on him at baptism. Yes, he was fond
of chicken, but never had been arrested
for stealing birds of that species. No,
he would not swear that he never had
visited another person's fowl preserves
with felonious intent. What had that
to do with the present charge of va
grancy, anyhow?
"Nothing at all," said Judge Caban
iss, "and we'll consider the vagrancy
charge later."
Ole Peterson sang so Rmdly at a
Salvationist meeting on Kearny street
that his discordant tones drowned even
the bass drum and he would not desist
bellowing until it was necessary to
summon a policeman to remove him.
He was given twenty-four hours' im
prisonment despite his plea that his
voice Y' as raised in worship instead of
derision and that it was unjust to pun
ish a man for having unusual vocal
strength.

were unable to ascend and get ' him.

Judge, however, dismissed him with a

"You Never Spoke to Me Like That
Before" was the songr warbled by Miss
Gertrudino Gasperino^i the North End
Concert Hall, where Silvio Bacigalupl
and Frank Glannini disturbed the
peace and were, arrested. There was
nothing in either words or the plaintive
music of the ditty that would provoke
any reasonable spirit to disorderly con
ductâindeed, many of the feminine au
ditors were moved to tears, and sobs
were audible from various parts of the
auditorium, when one of the defend
ants shouted "rotten!" and the other
one laughed mockingly at the singer.
When the special policeman sought to
eject the two Irreverent youths they
struck him. Judge Mogan will hear

dis: I takes de booze because de doc
orders it for me noives."
"What's the matter with your
nerves?"
"Dey have been shattered ever since
de captive balloon got away."
Arthur's further statements were so
utterly irrelevant and incoherent that
the Judge hastily gave him twenty
four hours.
"I know nothing of the sort," said
the Judge. "Am I to understand that
because you drink whisky you do not
use opium?"
Merchants in the vicinity of'Sacra

the police that they were greatly an

It is a serious matter for the State. There be those who will
<ay that the reputation of our fruit is established, and it is not nec
cssnry to make any further effort at spreading its fame. But this
i^ a mistake.^ As well mijjht we say that our reputation as a minim?
r.nd timber Stztc is established and it is unnecessary, to illustrate
either of those resources at the great exposition. " Hundreds ' of
thousands of visitors there carry away in lasting form the im
pression that is made upon them by what they see. : If they find the
fruit oi Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Florida and Missouri there,
in greater excellence than what we exhibit, they will inevitably con
clude that, challenged by the opportunity California has not made
gootf. *
.There is much time left, and much fruit yet to mature in Cali
fornia, and our planters should bestir themselves m holding up the
hands of the State Commission and vindicating the reputation of
California. It is true that fruit is a short crop this year, but the
quality is excellent, and* there is enough to spare the quantity needed
to bold fpr us our place as the foremost fruit region in the world.
IT was to be expected that California would be handicapped in
keeping up a fresh fruit supply at St. Louis by the difficulties of
distance and transportation. But it was not expected by the
State Commissioners that in addition to this their efforts would be
made useless by the failure^of the orchardists here to siipplv the
best material in sufrkientquantity, the Commissioners assuming 1 the
risk and meeting the difficulties of transportation. It seems, how
ever, that the supply is lacking. The orchardists have not come to
the front as they should, either in the quantity or quality of the fruit
pv.t at the disposal of the Commissioners.

London Woman
Successful as
a House Agent
Her Intrusion in the Field
Rouses Ire of the Men in
the Business and They Bar
Her From Their Institute.
THE house agents of London
are up in arms against the
intrusion of a woman upon
the domain they have here
tofore regarded as exclusively
their own. Their organization,
known as the Institute of House
and Estate Agents, has refused
to acknowledge Mrs. Arthur
Holland of 44 BromDton road
as a house agent and refused to
allow her membership.
Mrs. Holland is the only lady
In London who personally man
ages the whole of her business
and. although she has been es
tablished only two years, she
has already a very extensive cli
entele. â¢ ; jj
"I think the house agent busi
ness an ideal one for women,"
she told an interviewer.
"Women manage, their; houses,
live within doors more than
men and j in every way know
more about, the i possible com
forts and discomforts than a
man possibly can. For _ these
reasons alone women are well
suited to the occupation, provid
ing they have sufficient business
ability and push.\ I have been
successful so far, i partly because
I do what I believe no other
agent does â that is, personally
undertake the choice of a house '
for an applicant."*
Mrs. Holland's work branches _
out In many other, directions be
yond the mere letting and tak
ing of housesj She undertakes
to pack furniture, to transfer '
and rearrange "it; also to furnish
houses completely and t to dec
orate and renovate them.

house she let last year, and sev

"Dress records" are the latest nov
elty in the way of* scrapbooks now be
ing kept by girls in high society, and
it is a distinctly pretty and inexpen
sive idea. For 25 or 60 cents a good,
strong scrapbook is .obtained, and in
this book are pinned small cuttings of
every dress which the owner has worn
since a certain date, along with bits
of the trimmings.
Besides the cost of the dress the
special occasions on which each was
worn is written beside the cutting.
In later years It will be refreshing to
the mind of the keeper of the record
to note such interesting annotations as:
"I was wearing this dress at the Bar
ring's ball, when Tom proposed," with
a few inches of ping satin snippings
of ribbons, laces and so en, and- the
figures "$60" alongside. Such a book
tends to foster economy, too. for most
young women are quite startled when,
by glancing through their "dress rec
ords," they find how much money has
bten spent on their personal adorn
ment.âChicago Tribune.
"Dress Records"
Pretty Idea
A glorious American eagle, as
jaunty as any that ever spread across
a gold piece, got tangled ingloriously
in a woman's petticoat in Trenton, N.
J., the other day. Now It is smooth
ing out its ruffled feathers, no longer a
bird of freedom, in a cage at ' Cad
wallader Park, Trenton..
Mrs. George T. Shaw of 749.Beatty
street. Trenton, fought this eagle and
vanquished it with -her petticoat. It
measured just five feet eleven inches
from tip to tip, and it looks hungry.
Mrs. Shaw and her friend, Mrs.
Armot Penrose of 321 j Monmouth
street, Trenton, were walking in Mrs.
Fenrose's garden when down swooped
the eagle. The big bird sunk its talons
into Mrs. Shaw's shoulders and ac
tually tried to carry her off.
The woman screamed for help. Mrs.
Shaw threw herself to the ground and
the bird fluttered away for a second.
Before she could arise it flew at her
ajrain. and, "gripping- her skirt, tried
to rise with her. The terrifying spec
tacle of the ungainly bird smothering
her with its flapping wings did not de
piive Mrs. Shaw of her presence of
m.'nd.- Seizing the bottom of her skirt
and petticoat she drew them up over
the struggling bird, enveloping it The
eagle fought with its head and beak,
talons and wings.
"Sit on it,", cried Mrs. Shaw, and
Mrs. Penrose , dropped on the bundle
of petticoat that ; held the American
eagle. ,The two women held , on for
dear life until men arrived and helped
them "out of their predicament. The
bird's wings were bound | with ropes
and the feet tied, and the two women,
much delighted, gave the bird of free
dom to the keeper of the park, to be
cased and gazed on by the younger
generation. :

LONDON, Aue. 21. â There was
graduated from Oxford University
about a 1 month ago a young man re
garding whose future English literary
folk are exceedingly curious. They
are anxious to see if Edmund Curti3
âthat is his name â will fulfill the
promise given in his boyhood, when
he produceo>^>oetry which so good an
authority as Andrew Lang pronounced
better than the e..rly efforts of Sir
Walter Scott. Curtis' career thus far
recalls in many ways that of Charles
Dickens, though the author of "David
Copperfleld" received no such en
couragement in his youth as that
which has been the portion of Curti3.
Dickens planned stories while^pastlng
labels on boxes of blacking. Curtis
composed poetry while making golf
balls in an India rubber factory. His
parents were poor folk, living in the
East End of London, near the Albert
docks, a district given up to chemical
factories, soap-boiling plants, India
rubber works and similar industries â
not the sort of surroundings most
likely to foster the muse. When he
was 10 Edmund Curtis entered one of
these India rubber factories and there,
for nearly three years he worked
eleven hours a day. But, in such
leisure as he could get, he read the
classics â Homer, Cervantes. Byron.
Moore and Burns, and when he was
13 he began to write poetry, get
ting his inspiration, however, from
the misery he saw about him.
In 1896 a London magazine published
a poem of his callecj "The Factory
Bell," which at oi\ce called attention
to the young writer.
early verses good.
Andrew Lang saw quite a lot of
Curtis' work, and his exact words
concerning it were these: "The early
verses of Scott are really not so good
as those of Edmund Curtis." Such
praise led to a local interest being
taken in Curtis, with the result that
four men of means clubbed together
to give him a thorough education.
They sent him first to a private
school in Devonshire, then to a high
school in Keswick, and eventually to
Keble College, Oxford. From the first
Curtis has distinguished himself and
justified the confidence of his "back
ers," and in the July examinations
at Oxford he gained a first-class with
honors. "Promptly upon leaving the
university he plunged into literary
work in London and is at present on
the staff of a daily newspaper, so it
should not be long before he shows
what there is in him.

day or two ago for Marienbad. where

Special Correspondence.
The use of the power of organization for the injury of others is
having a startling illustration in the butchers' strike. President Don
nelly made public proclamation that he intended to afflict the whole
country with a meat famine, and has taken steps to that end. His
forces have torn out railroad tracks and obliterated switches in the
Chicago stockyards, to prevent the running of meat trains, and have
invested and besieged every slaughtering and packing plant from
New York to Omaha, to prevent, by intimidation and active violence,
their operation by non-union labor, which seems to be plentv and
available. Mr. Donnelly is making war by arms and by famine, to
force the employers to make a contract which Judge Ludwig holds
to be unlawful. Upon this original violation of the law, coercion to
procure an illegal contract, are built various other violations, includ
ing attacks on life and property.
If Mr. Donnelly can 'make war upon the law by means of a meat
famine, he may add thereto a bread famine. He may also cut off
the water of a city and compel its surrender by thirst. The Milwau
kee decision makes it plain that if the community be starved into
compelling the employers to raise the siege by surrender to Mr. Don
nelly, that gentleman will have been put above the law. The example
will be bad. Every surrender of lawful rights to physical -force is
bad. Every capitulation to numbers who defy the law makes defiance
of the law safer for a less number, until finally it will be without
the respect of any.
The decision of Judge Ludwig and the law and its spirit, which
that decision expresses, will be appreciated and accepted by all the
intelligent trade unionists who have the right American spirit. Its
propriety was in effect. declared by Mr. Benham, in his Labor day
speech in this city, when he said : "There is a charge made against
the trade unionists that no sane man would attempt to denyâthat
their mistakes have been grievous and many, and because of their
mistakes some unthinking persons say that the unions should be
destroyed.**
As the courts point out these mistakes the number of such un
thinking persons will be less..
The matter is of great present interest in Milwaukee. The City
Council of that city has recently ruled that bids for a new pumping
plant shall be jimited to firms which have contracts for the employ
ment of union labor only, and who will agree to never employ any
other. In addition to this the same Council has passed a resolution
lo employ only union labor in all classes of city work. All this is
voided by Judge Lud wig's decision, and therefore the matter is a
burning issue in Milwaukee, which makes it remarkable that only
one side of the case was sent out to the country.
So much of the decision serves to disclose its reach, and that it
declares principles long held to be essential to civil liberty. Men
cannot by contract deny the right of others to live by their labor,
for that is condemnation to death.
"The effectuation of such a purpose would conflict with that prin
ciple of public policy which prohibits monopolies in exclusive priv
ileges. It would tend to deprive the public of the services of men
in useful employments and capacities. This- agreement strikes at
the right of contract and provides that complainant shall employ
none but members of the several unions, thus discriminating in favoij
of one class of men and against all others, creating a monopoly in
favor of the members of the different unions to the exclusion of the
workmen not members of such unions, and is in this respect un
lawful. Contracts tending to create monopolies are void."
A LABOR INJUNCTION.
THE press dispatches not long ago published a decision of a
Milwaukee court, which by injunction had enforced a con
tract made between employers and a tailors' union, by which
the employing firm bound itself to employ only union tailors. As
it was the first instance in which an American court has been asked
to enforce such a contract, much astonishment was caused by the
decision. It lias always been believed that when contracts and
agreements to employ labor, discriminative and exclusive in their
nature, were taken into court, they would be voided as against good
conscience or public policy.
The Milwaukee case had a sequel, though it was not pub
lished as widely as the original finding. The case was taken before
judge Luuwig.'who ruled that the temporary injunction was improv
ident!}- issued, and dissolved it. But he went further, handing down
3 decision which voids all such contracts. He held them void for
hck of mutuality. The employer binds himself to employ only union
labor, but the union enters into no undertaking to supply such labor
as he may need; and suffers no forfeiture for not supplying it. It is
a principle of the law of contracts that the party who is not bound
himself cannot enforce the contract as obligatory on the other party.
Hut while Judge- Ludwig finds the contract void for lack of mu
tuality, his decision points out that that is the least of its infirmities.
He says: ""The contract is void as against public policy. In the
general consideration of the subject it must be premised that the
organization or co-operation of workirigmen is not against any pub
lic policy. Indeed, it must be regarded as having the sanction of
law when it is for such legitimate purposes as obtaining advance in
the rate of wages, or any of the other purposes stated in plaintiff's
complaint. It is proper and praiseworthy, and perhaps falls within
that general view of human society which perceives an underlying
Inw that men should unite to achieve that which each by himself can
not achieve, or can achieve less readily. But the social principle,
which justifies such organizations, is departed from when they are
so extended in their operation as either to intend or accomplish in
"Public policy and the interests of society favor the utmost free
dom in the citizen to pursue his lawful trade or calling, and if the
purpose of an organization or combination of workingmen be to
Hamper or restrict that freedom, and through contract or arrange
ment with employers to coerce other workingmen to become mem
bers of the organization and to come under its rules and conditions,
under the penalty of loss of their position and of deprivation of em
ployment, then that purpose seems clearly unlawful and militates
against the spirit of our Government and the nature of our institu
tions.

HOW TO "DRAW" KIPLING.
Rudyard Kipling has no greater af
fection than most authors for the "au
tograph fiend," but there is one way in
which he can always be "drawn" and
that is by addressing him on some sub
ject connected with either the British
army or navy. Kipling's interest in both
services is so genuine and he has so
many ideas for their improvament that
it is seldom indeed that a letter ad
dressed to him about Tommy Atkins or
"the Handyman" is unanswered. The
other day one wrote to him asking
what he thought the best means of cre
ating among the general public a real
interest and sympathy toward the
navy. Kipling's reply was not long de
layed: "By making the general public
liable to serve in the navy." he wrote.
"Nothing quickens one's sympathy
with another man's work so much as
the possibility of having to do that
work himself."

Regarding the recent trouble between
the executors of the late George GIs
sing and H. G. Wells over the intro
duction written by the latter for Gis
slng's posthumous novel, the impres
sion has been given that the executors
were entirely in the wrong. It may be
recalled that they refused to allow
Wells' contribution to be Included in
Gissing's volume and that the pub
lisher declined, on that account, to pay
trie price originally stipulated for the
work. The "introduction" has been
published In the Monthly Review and
after reading it one feels that Gissing's
representatives had some reason for
their action regarding it, as one or two
brief extracts will show. Wells, who
was, of course, one of GIsslng'3 closest
friends, says that the hidden element
In him was practical incapacity, a "cu
rious Inability to do the sane, secure
thing." He did not know what would
offend and he did not know what would
please. He Irritated others and thwart
ed himself. He had no social nerve.
"In his novels," Wells continues, "there
are great uninspired intervals, uncon
vincing characters, and gray, tired
places." There is much more of the
same kind of thing. By the way. most
people here were surprised to learn
what Wells says is the case that Gls
sing* was for a short time a classical
tutor in Boston, and later came near to
absolute starvation in Chicago, where
his literary career began with some
newspaper fiction, now lost track of
entirely.

CALL, BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. Sept. 7.â Alleging that
more than 1500 Chinese women are liv
ing a life of wretched slavery in San
Francisco, the women composing the
Women's Christian Temperance Union
of California appealed to the State De
partment to-day to take some action.
The appeal was turned over to the Bu
reau of Immigration, whose officials de
clared that the statement was not ex
aggerated. Numerous schemes are em
ployed to bring immigrants in and each
person is charged a comparatively
large sum. The immigrant, of course,
has no money to pay, so the amount
is forwarded by merchants, with the
promise that the immigrant will pay
it back from his wages. Under this
condition he becomes the virtual slave
of the merchant who advances the
money. 'All qf his wages are turned
over as fast as they are due. The wages
are small and the sums usually de
manded for entry very large. Num
bers of unfortunate men and women
brought fr*om China in this manner
live as slaves for ten, fifteen and even
twenty years.
The immigrants, it is said, never
think of breaking their contracts. They
know that such action would mean
death to them, or, if they escaped, it
would mean death to their relatives in
China. /â¢-'./
The Bureau of Immigration has just

$800 in Mexican money and then $110
in American money was added to their
debt on the ground that it was needed
to overcome some unexpected difficulty.
In answer to the charges of the Cali
fornia women the immigration officials
say that it is impossible to tell' how
many men and women are living In
slavery In San Francisco. Even the
census officials were unable to get any
statistics. Repeated trips through
Chinatown and investigations of the
tenements there fail to produce results,
and the officials declare that the break
ing up of the wretched colony is prac
tically impossible.

BUILDING FOOD.
To Brins tbc Babies Around.
When a little human machine (or a
larjre one) goes wrong, nothing is so
important as the selection of food
which will always bring it around
a fain.
"My little baby boy, fifteen months
old, had pneumonia, then came brain
fever, and no sooner had he got over
these than he began to' cut teeth and.
being so weak he was frequently
thrown into convulsions," says a Col-
orado mother.
**I decided a change might help, so
took him to Kansas City for a visit.
When we got ther*> he was so very
weak when he would cry he would sink
away and seemed like he would die.
"When I reached my sister's home
she eaid immediately that we must
feed him Grape-Nuts and, although I
had never used the food, we got some
and for a few days gave him Just the
Juice of Grape-Nuts and milk. He got
M ranger eo quickly we were soon feed-
ing him the Grape-Nuts itself and in a
wonderfully short time he fattened
right ur> and became strong and well.
"That showed me something worth
knowing and. when later on my girl
came. I raised her on Grape-Nuts and
rht Is a strong healthy baby and has
been. You will see from the little pho-
tograph I send you what a strong,
chubby youngster the boy Is now, but
ho didn't look anything like that before
we found this nourishing foodL, Grape-
Nuts nourished him back to strength
when he was so weak he couldn't keep
any other food on his stomach." Name

All children can be built to a more

The draft was allowed and every
thing was thought to be lovely, but
now a letter comes from President
Hart of the Chicago Nationals, claim
ing he had notified the commission on
August 30 that he had purchased
Whalen. Careful search reveajed that
the notice of the Whalen purchase
had been stuck away in a letter In
which notice of sale of another player
to the Chicago club was also men
tioned.
Naturally the claim of Chicago was
allowed and Cincinnati loses the
player.

SEATTLE. Sept. 7. â All kinds of
baseball and the worst exhibition of
umpiring ever seen In Seattle were the
features of to-day's ten-inning game,
which went to the Tigers. Umpire
Brown made Jay Hughes cut the plate
every time in order to get a strike. In
the tenth inning Hughes apparently
struck out. two men who were sent to
first on balls. A double by Lynch
then scored three men and won the
game.
Seattle tied the score In the ninth
by a remarkable batting rally, scoring
six runs after two men were out. Fitz
gerald pitched well for Taeoma, al
though he was liberal with bases on
balls. Doyle dropped a fly In right
field inside -the line, yet Umpire Brown
called it a foul. The score:

will bring out some spirited racing.
Much interest centers In the free-for

should be a smart race In every heat.
The best two in three heats will de

With the thermometer at 110 degrees
in the cool places and many degrees
higher in the sun-baked courts, the
tennis players struggled for supremacy
yesterday at San RafaeL The specta
tors were treated to the greatest sur
prise In years. This was the defeat of
Percy Murdock and Drummond Mac-
Gayjn at the hands of Robert N. Whit
ney and Clarence Griffin. After dispos
ing of Elliott and Overtcm easily on the
previous day, MacGavin and Murdock
looked like- sure winners. Some figured
there w&fra. possibility of their being
beaten by Allen and Baker, but nobody
conceded Whitney and Griffin a chance.
MacGavin and Murdock were pos
sibly suffering from over-confidence,
while Whitney and Griffin went
into the match with nothing to
lose and with everything to gain.
If . the defeated team had lost In
a five-set match it would have been
surprise enough, but they lost in
straight sets. Whitney and Griffin
played an excellent game both at the
net and in the back court.
The first set Whitney and Griffin won
handily and one and all thought the
losers would only have to get started
to win out In the second set Mac-
Gavin and Murdock led at 4-2, and had
vantage In several of the games, but
they all went to Whitney and Griffin.
The third and last set was a repetition
of the second. MacGavin and Murdock
again led at 4-2, only to lose the next
four games straight.
Whitney did some fine volleying,
driving and smashing, and received
good support from his younger and less
experienced partner. It was another
match that demonstrated the uncer
tainty of tennis. By virtue of their
victory Whitney and Griffin will meet
the winner of the match between Allen
and Baker and Gardner and Rolfe in
the finals on Friday.
Despite the experience he has gained
on the Eastern tennis courts, Reuben
G. Hunt proved no match for Trow
bridge Hendrick of Southern California.
The latter lost the first set but won the
next three by scoring 8-6, 6-2, 6-2. Hen
drick looks to have an excellent chance
of meeting Bell on Saturday. He will
meet MacGavin in the semi-finals. The
other semi-final match will be between
Murdock and Overton^
In the ladies' singles. Miss Florence
Sutton defeated her sister. Miss Vio
let. The. latter won only three games
in two sets. Miss Florence Sutton will
meet Miss Hazel Hotchkiss of Berke
ley in the finals. The winner will play
Miss May Sutton on Saturday morning.
The matches played yesterday resulted
as fallows:
Men's doublesâ R. N. Whitney and C. Grif
fin beat J. D. MacGavin and Percy Murdock,
0-3. 6-4. 6-4.
Ladies' singles â Miss Florence Sutton beat
Miss Violet Sutton. 6-1, 6-2.
Mixed doubles â Mrs. Seymour and Griffin
beat Miss Hotchkiss and Will Allen. 6-4. 6-2:
Miss Violet Sutton and Hendrick beat Mrs.
Bruce and Long. 7-5, ti-2: Miss F. Sutton and
F. Elliott beat Miss E. Ratcliffe and Dunlap.

When Jimmy Buchanan is right
none of them has any license to hand
it out to him. He came near being
the shutout kid yesterday and It was
agonizlnz to see the Seals swinging
wildly and hitting nothing. A double
dummy play by Kruger and Devereaux
in the eighth round let San Francisco
get one and spoiled Buchanan's
chance for a blank. Score â Oakland
4, San Francisco 1.
Although the day was the hottest
that ever visited the Eighth-street lo,
the talent put up a good article of ball.
All the errors that did happen were
unlucky ones and allowed runs to
come in. Oakland made its first two
runs off misplays by Gorton and Goch
nauer. The latter booted another ball
and let another run score ere the
game had gone Its course.
Barber was bit hard and often. He
had nothing with which to puzzle the
Commuters and were it not for their
bad work on the sacks they might
have rolled up twice as many runs as
they did. In the seventh three hits â
a double and two singles â failed to
produce a single tally.
Dunleavy had ten chances In left
field and took "em all. He might have
madf it eleven, but in going after
Waldron's drive in the seventh he
slipped and could only get one mitt
on it. This was the first hit made
uff Buchanan's delivery. The score:

STANDING OP THE CLUBS.
Jimmy Gardner, the Lowell boxer,
who was pronounced a fighting mar
vel recently, has notified Manager
Gresgains of the San Francisco Ath
letic Club that he will not come West
to ficht Joe Gans. The lightweight
champion Is on the ground without an
opponent In eight.
Gardner fought Martin Canole near
Boston on Labor day and different ac
counts have been sent out regarding
the affair. One had It that Gardner
was eo badly punished that he cried
In the ring. Another report said one
cf the rounds was cut to two minutes
to save Canole from being knocked
out. It was also claimed that a friend
ef Canole'a was referee and that he
favored the latter.
What reason Gardner has for call
ing off the match is not known here.
If Canole could make him cry, what
the hard-hitting Gans would have
done to him would have been some
thing terrible. Manager Greggains is
trying to make another match. As
there is no one In sight to fight Gans
he Is considering a bout between Twin
Eulllvan and Dave Barry and another
between Kid Sullivan and Dick Hy
land. the amateur.

SHEEPSHEAD BAY, Sept. 7.â In the
presence of an enthusiastic crowd of
racegoers, August Belmont's splendid
filly. Beldame, racing in the name and
in the colors of Newton Bennlngton and
ridden by his regular Jockey, O'Neill,
defeated Graziallo, Ort Wells and
Ocean Tide in the September stakes to
day at Sheepshead Bay. She thus emu
lated the no less memorable exploit of
Pretty Polly in England, winning the
Doncaster St. Leger and defeating the
best of her age and of either sex which
had the temerity to engage with her.
Excellent race though Beldame ran, it
was claimed that Ort Wells could not
have been as good as he was in the
Century stakes a few days ago when
he was beaten a short head by Stal
wart at one mile an'd a half in 2:311-5,
the best time on record for the stake.
But whereas Ort Wells carried 115
pounds in the Century,' he carried 126
pounds yesterday, and in the opinion of
many racegoers that made a difference
in his performance,' although not as
much as the marked difference between
his head defeat in the Century and his
comparatively poor third In the Sep
tember stakes.

I had Nasal Catarrh for years for which I
nsed S. S. S. with very gratifying results.
I tried local applications for some time,
and getting no permanent relief I came to
the conclusion that the seat of the trouble
was in the blood. Knowing S. S. S. to be Â»
a good blood medicine I began its use,
and after using it for some little while it
did away entirely with the offensive mu-

hawk and spit, especially in the morning,
to dislodge the catarrhal matter.

000 alleged to be due as commissions
on the business of Catton, Bell & Co.
during the ten years that Clark was
manager of the concern Judge Sea
well yesterday overruled the defend
ants' demurrer and gave them ten
days to answer. The Judge said that
in his opinion" the alleged agreement
"to, pay the plaintiff a certain per
centage of the net proceeds of the
business 'as the business would jus
tify" is void for Its uncertainty and ae
will entertain a motion to strike out
all of the allegations in reference to
a bonus. If such a motion Is made
and granted Clark's claim will be
greatly reduced.

, "I am in favor of making a test case
In court of the arbitrary action of the
Supervisors in making appropriations
for specific purposes," said Commis
sioner Maestretti, "so that the money
cannot be used for necessary repairs
to accepted streets, despite the fact
that the commissioners are held per
sonally liable for accidents."
Later Maestretti and Donovan held
a consultation and hit upon a plan to
compel property owners to put down
good sidewalks. It was agreed that a
resolution of Intention be adopted 'to
reconstruct all defective sidewalks. All
protests would be overruled and then
bids would be invited In the same man
ner as when the city does the work,
but the expense .would be made a Hen
on the property fronting the sidewalk.
The owner of the sidewalk at Post
street and Central avenue was noti
fied to put down a new sidewalk, as
the old one Is dangerous. Pending his
action a barricade was placed around
the pavement.
The City Engineer reported that the
city would have to bear $120 of the cost
of improving Forty-ninth avenue, near
H street. As the board has no funds
for the purpose the Supervisors will be
asked to provide the money out of the
urgent necessity fund.
The board notified Rogers & Duffy to
remove certain fences obstructing the
westerly side of Buena Vista avenue,
between Haight and Waller streets.
Corrected deeds were accepted from
the Pope Estate Company for the ex
tension of Shrader and Cole streets and
Alma avenue.
Deputy A. J. Donovan ascertained
that the street described had not been
accepted bythe city and the property
owners are liable for the Improvement,
so a resolution of expediency was
adopted for the laying of new side
walks on the block.
Additional complaints were filed yes
terday with the Board of Works rela
tive to the dangerous conditions of sev
eral sidewalks. H. Bohls complained
that the sidewalk on Fremont street,
between Howard and Folsom, was a
constant menace to life and limb and
had injured several persons. He asked
that the sidewalk be fenced In.
Resolutions of Intention
Will Be Adopted and Then
â¢ AH Protests Overruled
WORK IS TO BE ORDERED

BRAVE FIREMAN
ANSWERS THE
FINAL ALARM
The re^dents in the neighborhood
of O'Farrell and Laguna streets were
yesterday treated to a novel eight. A
home made waterspout was caused by
a private ambulance striking the hy
drant on the north side of O'Farrell,
between Laguna and Buchanan. The
hydrant was broken short. The force
of water raised the stream to a height
of fifty feet with a ten-inch diameter.
This spouted for threA-quarters of an
hour before Captain H. D. Rice of the
Fire Department arrived and shut off
the supply. The repairing of this
break will entail an expense of $S0 to
the city, as the owner of the ambu
lance is unknown.

Dr. Askam is a well known physician
in Mountain View and Mr. Levin is a
business man of that place. A few
friends of the g'irls had been let into
the secret. It is said that -while here
the young ladles wrote a letter to their
father asking his forgiveness.
A wedding breakfast was enjoyed in
one of the restaurants, and at 9:20
o'clock the party left on a south bound
train for an extended honeymoon,
which will Include a trip to St. Louis.
The two brides are daughters of S.
H. Kifer, a large land owner and or
chardlst. -who resides on the Grant road
near Fremont avenue. They are pretty
and accomplished and have many
friends in Mountain View and San
Jose.
SAX JOSE. Sept. ".âA double elope
ment, in which two sisters participated,
took place from Mountain View about
4 o'clock Tuesday mornfcig. Miss Lil
lian Kifer and Dr. O. P. Askam were
one of the couples and Miss Nita Kifer
ar.d George A. Levin the other. Ths
party left Mountain View about 4
o'clock in the morning with a double
team and drove to this city. They ar
rived here about 6 o'clock and routed
a deputy clerk out of his bed to se
cure a license. The couples at once
went to the residence of the Rev.
Francis Palmer on South Eleventh
street and were married.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Fire in a building at 32 Fremont street
last night caused damage to the extent
of $40,000. The fire began in the top
floor and burned out the entire interior.
Tons ol water were poured into the
building by the flre department. The
alarm came late and between fire and
water ther building was. made a sieve.
The first notice of the conflagration
came from A. W. King, a watchman.
Before the department arrived the
flames "were painting crimson pictures
against the night sky.
From the roof of the burning build
ing the firemen poured water on the
flames. It sifted through to the base
ment like rain. Two flre walls on each
Bide of ths premises prevented the
spread of the flames. The Interior of
the building was ruined. Its occupants
lost practically everything.
On the fourth floor, where the flre
started, was located the Consolidated
Paper and Box Company. Its loss in
stock was total. The third floor was
occupied by the International Paper
and Bill Company. "Water ruined its
entire stock. The West Coast Rubber
Company occupied one of the floors.
No estimate could be given last night
of its lossf but it will not be large.
The Pacific Steel and Hardware Com
pany, a branch of the United Iron
Works, occupied the ground floor. It
had much valuable machinery and the
damage to it by water is problematical.
The building is owned by the Dona
hue estate, and the lossÂ»on it will prob
ably amount to $20,000. v

STOCK MARKET.
* CHICAGO. Sept. 7.â The wheat marken
opened firm on higber prices at Liverpool and
on continued reports of damage -in the North
west. ' Initial quotations on December were,
up a shade to U@% at $1 OtJ'-i to $1 Otivi- Dur
ing the early part of the day trading was
rather light in volume, but toward the^uoon
hour some good buying developed. One of the
principal operators was credited tvith buying
both Deceember and May through. commission
houses while selling . December openly. Favor
able weather throughout the greater part of the
country was responsible for much of the early
selling. As the season advanced the market
became quite strong under, the Influence of a
bullish situation in the Northwest. An Im
proved demand for flour was manifested at
Minneapolis and a 'consequent rally in wheat
prices there helped the speculative trading in
this market. St. Louis also reported a : better
demand for flour. Primary receipts were much
.smaller; than, a year ago. Theee deficiencies
in arrivals imparted some additional strength
to the market. There was also some buying on
an unofficial estimate of the total French crop,
the figures being placed at 292,000,000 bush
'ele. The. yield last year, according to official
sources, was 366,000,000 bushels. Stimulated
by these bullish influences December advanced
to" $107Â»i. Although part .of : the gain wan
:Iost on realizing, the market cloeed firm, with
December M9Â¥s higher at $106TÂ«.
; Higher cables and strength of wheat was
'largely responsible for; a- firm tone In corn.
December closed with a gain of Me at 5t?ic;
Oats, were dull,. December closing Uc lower
at 82Â»4c. . : - . jr.-,.;
. .The feature of the trading in provisions was
'a moderate demand for lard. Prices showed
little fluctuation. October pork closed un

NEW YORK. Sept. 7.â Special telegraphic
communications received by Dradstrcet show
the following changes in available supplies
with last accounts:
Wheat â United States and Canada, east of
Rockies, increased S7Â£.00O bushels; afloat for
and In Europe. Increase 3.100.000 bushels:
total supply increase, 3.07S.0OO bushels.
Corn â United States, anil Canada, east of
Rockies, increase 4.234.OCO bushels.
Chicago Board of Trade.
Available Grain Supply.
The Chicago wireÂ« of E. F Hutton & Co.
said: "The closing was a fittl* ea6y and 1
the market did not hold more, than half the j
day's advance. . The bullish Items were the j
higher cables, better demand for Flour and I
strong cash markets In the Bouthwest. It Is a I
dull market, however, and the dullness op
erates against Improved prices. There has ,
been a little better buying' of "Wheat by pro- J
fetsionals the past two days, but it is not
on a large scale, ar.d there Is no great snap
to the market. There is no modification of
previous estimates of crop conditions In the
Northwest. Threshing returns continue to bear
out earlier reports of excessive damage. It
seems likely that quite a large per cent of the
crop will produce very little flour-making
Wheat. Stocks of Flour are everywhere pretty
well exhausted.' We would rather work on the
long *lde and buy -Wheat on soft spots."
In thic market -,the cash grain was quiet.
Futures were l^c higher on the morning ses
sion In sympathy with" Chicago,' but were off
in- tho afternoon, and the market was devoid
of feature.

KEW TOEK, Bept. T. â TliÂ« advocates ef
hlgbcr prices for stacks met less enooorae*
raerrt frost tie action of to-day's market than
tram that of resterday. Ther* was little news
to aococat for the reaction, as there was to
exjjlaia the afivanc*. Tie volume of dealings
was weH cp to tint of jesterday. but the buy
ing of tlocij fnxa outside aouroea and throegfa
cossiaslon booses or aeUlcg wu as little In
â¢vldenoe es ax any time tfurin* the current pe
riod ef activity. The conclusion was general
that the dealings are largely due to operations
of parties of speculator* or of lanre individual
traders who rake an avocation cf operations.
It was quite evident that many of such, opera
tor* wfco were conspicuous buyers in yester
day's market were free sellers to take profits
â¢o-dty. This Is the sufficient explanation of
the artual movement of prices and in order
to adequately Judge the value of the price
movement if an index of conditions and value*
It would be necessary -to know the motives
ana information which prompted operations.
There were no public development* to throw
light on tbis subject. In view of yesterday's
wide advance In the Pacifies and the subse
quent public announcement of hopeful views
cf prcepects for values from an official quar
tt connected with the system thus ' aXTe^ted,
fomf cf -the efeculative followers of the. move
ment ev.deatly feared that the effective fcuy/
ir.g that thry had tyen following might be coo
i-'.dered to be now concluded: The pressure, to
take profit? in the Pacifies in consequence vu
Â«;uiie urgent. The opening prices for them
ehowed a motr.<?ntar>" eSect from the interview
r^rerred to. but these were the highest prices
of the day. Their subsequent decline proved
of <J?cJFive effect on sentiment. In the railroad
IiFt effort* to contejrt ttie reaction were rather
ineffectual. In a i?ectir>n of the industrial list,
however, a ccnFiderable degree of strength
developed aed served as a partial offset to the
heaviness in the railroad list. The iron and
Â«eel Gtocks m-ere most conspicuous in this
movement, but other metal stocks and also the
railroad equipment companies which make a
large use of iron were affected. In
fiympathy. It vrai argued that the
agreement of the pools In steel products to
reduce prices had done away with the danger
ef an opÂ«i market and harmful eoznpetitiSn.
Report* were also current cf come large orders
for railroad construction and equipment which
were awaiting the reduced prices of steel prod
ucts. These conflicting Influences kept prices
moving irregularly all day. The reaction was
In force at fhe closing, which was heavy. An
appreciably firmer tone was evident' both for
call end time loane as a consequence of thÂ»
decline ' In the banking surplus and the in
creasing demand for money in connection with
the etock market speculation. Some attention
Â¦Jeo was paid to reports of corn crop damage
'from the Southwest. Neither of these factors
ceemed to be sufficiently pronounced to have
rmich influence on the movement of prices.
To-day's reports of railroad gross earnings
f cr the fourth week ta August were uniformly
eseorraglR*.
The bond market ecctlsaed broad and gen*
esa!!y firm. Total sales, par value. $5,465,000.

The market was active, as retailers were
obliged to purchase freely to rep!eni.-h thÂ«Ir
ftocka. which had been practically exhausted
by the active consumptive demand of the pa-n
few aays. The market for Watermelon* was
booming and. although offerings were liberal,
the market was pretty well cleaned up at the
close. The -best lots or Cantaloupes and Xut
mrg Melons met with prompt faie at good
prices, but a considerable portion of the offer
ings were soft and otherwise poor and dragged
at unsteady rates. Table Grape.-i in large boxss
were in good request and brought better prices,
while offerings In Small packages were in
excessive supply and inclined to easiness.
Wine Grapes were selling Mowly at jirl'es
ranging from $H lo $1S per ton. Figs were
abundant and hard to sell, although ofter?d
at sharjily reduced prices, while other small

active and Oranges. Lemons and Mexican

were closely cleaned up.

The extra demand caused by the large num

buying for the Jewish holiday trade, caused
continued firmness In the Poultry market, and.
although receipts were large, the market was

Receipts of Potatoes were .moderate.' but
there was a heavy accumulation of old stock
lying around. All handlers reported a quiet
and weak market and some were trying to
force sales by shading the quotations. Onions
were quoted firm but inactive.
Changee in miscellaneous vegetables were
slight.' All kinds were In free supply and low
prices ruled for most descriptions. The "top
quotation for Tomatoes was obtained only for
a few brands of exceptionally fine stock. 40c

Beans were In increased supply. and dragged

usual answer to the contest of Adolph
Schander, denying that the girl was of
unsound mind when she made her will.
questions popped in like a fire from a
Maxim. Mostly they related to facts
that have already been, made public
regarding the Dolbeer case. Johnson
said after the examination that his
questions were largely preliminary.
"Expect a, sensation before we finish
with this case," he said. .-
The maih'Trfend "of tb;e.*questions was
regarding the disposition of Miss Dol
beef. The question of her fondness for
meri->was gone into. Miss Warren tes
tified that Miss Dolbeer mostly dlsUked
the male sex. Only two love affairs had
been. confided to her by Miss Dolbeer.
One of these occurred In San Francisco
about five years ago and the. other at
Coronado about three years later. Th*
names "of the men were riot mentioned.
She said she had never seen Mis3 Pol
beer despondent, but once she had
heard her say; that she wished she was
ide'ad. This, was durlny a spell of des
pondency due to Illness. Miss Warren
gave Miss Dolbeer. a high character for
sweetness of disposition/ declaring that
she had never exhibited any crossness
toward her. during an Intimacy of fif

In the witness chair she showed
signs of worry and fatigue. Hiram

I The- group in- -the' office d.uring the'
taking of the deposition: were Garret
McEnerney. Albert arid : Hiram John
son; Miss Gertrude Schanler, one of the
contestants, aged about 15 years;-Hor
ace D. Pillsbury. an- attorney for Â§ev
eral of the contestants, a nurse and
Miss Warren.
* The jaunty air of the deponent which
she exhibited the day before was gone.
As usual; she was gowned in black and
heavily veiled. She made her entrance
to the Nevada block by ..the least
known , way and . carefully ..avoided
giving- a proupW photographers, an op
portunity to get her likeness, which has
never been published.
. ; MKRELX A PRELUDE.
The trend "of the questions propound
ed to Miss Warren yesterday indicated
that much. The hearing was held in
the office of Garret McEnerney, who
has., recently,, been brought into the
case. . The proceedings were secret, ow
ing to an order of .Probate Judge Cof-.
fey,' but Attorney McEnerney insisted
on making public the questions and an
swers. He .instructed.' Stenographer
Smith to give the newspapers the '.en-'
tire "proceedings. 1 "' *' . ' '-. Â¦Â¦
j From the veiled threats of the attor
neys on both sides it is apparent that
a noisome "scandal is forthcoming un
less some settlement Is made.
SCANDAL IS PROMISED.
"All. of the collateral heirs are trying
for a slice. of the property. Miss War
ren,is the shining target for the assault
because she is the main beneficiary.

beer jumped from a nine-story window!,
in the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New|
York last April. '""â¢ , .
The' estate she left amounts to more
than $1,000,000. The, bulk of it was be
queathed to Miss Warren, who had
been decedent's governess and compan-.
ion for fifteen , years. Generally,
the. jblobd" relatives were forgotten, in
the distribution of an' estate acquired
by the industry of a man who piled
lumber for a' beginning. After Amass
ing, a fortune he died inl'this city on
August 17, 1902. leaving to his daughter

McAdie says that the tidal wave re
ported from the south is : merely a
phenomenally heavy surf due to dis
turbances along the Mexican coast.
OAKLAND. Sept. 7.â Oakland ex
perienced the hottest day of the pres
ent* " year'"!" to-day; "'the temperature
reaching 98 degrees in the shade.
The prophecy bore Mr. McAdie's sig
nature, but there was no wind, there
was ho fog. and there never has-been
so hot a day in- San Francisco. Fur
thermore, there was not eo much heat
in Manila or Honolulu, in Boston or
New York as in this city yesterday.
Yesterday" broke all records for hot
weather. and for dryness in. San.Fran
cisco. The mercury reached 100.2 de
grees Fahrenheit in the shade, and
there was only one-fifth of the normal
amount of moisture in -the -air. Pro
fessor McAdie,' of the Weather Bureau,
says the' temperature .will probably be
more comfortable to-day." - /
At 12 o'clock Tuesday night, the tem
perature'was 70 degrees;' at .4 o'clock
yesterday morning, 72; at 5 o'clock," 74;
at 7 o'clock, 76; at 9 o'clock,; 84; at 11
o'clock, 91; at 12 o'clock, 95; at 2 o'clock,
97; between 2:30 and 2:45 o'clock,' -100.2;
between 2:45 and 3 o|clock, 96; between
3 and 3:15 o'clock, 98;- at 3:30 o'clock,
100; at 4:30 o'clock, 56. "â¢;.
In measuring moisture, the meteoro
logists count fog as 100 and* absolute
dryness as zero. Â¦â¢
The- normal .humidity In San Fran
cisco is S8. Yesterday it was only 18.
The excessive dryness prevented people
from fully appreciating the heat,
although no one could doubt - yesterday
that the weather was a shade above
being cold. â¢ . â¢ -
Had San Francisco Jiad its usual hu
midity, or that of any city east of the
Mississippi River, thousands of people
would have. been prostrated yesterday.
But in this elysian region it "Is always
dry when the mercury climbs high.
According to McAdie, people -suffered
no more in San Francisco yesterday
With the temperature' at 100.2 degrees
than the Inhabitants of Boston of New
York do with the mercury at 80 ; de
grees. This- peculiarly fortunate state
qf affairs. is, due to the. city's, location
at the confluence of atmospheric rivers
from the land and from the sea. - t '
The second hottest day in the hjstory
of San Francisco was on June 29, 1891.
The third hottest day was June 6 of
last year. The hot weather is said to
be due to the .existence, of an area of
high preEHu're civer Nevada or low pres
sure over Mexico.
All who read the weather forecasts
yestef day morning rejoiced over these
words: "Fair Wednesday; cooler; 'light
north wind, changing to- brisk westerly,
with fog." .. > V
Judge Murasky granted a divorce to
Vyra Rommel from Gustave Rommel
for cruelty; Judge Lennon. In Judge
Kerrigan's court, to Birdie Jeffress
from William H. Jeffress for neglect;
Judpe Hunt to Archie A. Black' from
Nellie A. Black for desertion.
Suits for divorce were filed by Lu
rinda M. Herlihy against Robert T.
Herlihy. charging him with going* to
j'Srnies and dances v.ith other women;
Jfssit E. Murphy against John J. Mur
phy, neglect; Annie Perry against
William Perrr for cruelty, which com
menced a week after their marriage
last April; Eva M. Fuller against A. T.
Fuller. desertion; Albert M. Duff
against Mary Duff, desertion and cru
elty and a habit of kissing other men
in public; Anna B. Mills against Will
iam O. Mills, cruelty; Michael Meyer
against Sarah Meyer, desertion;- Ber
tha E. Rankin against Charles E. Ran
kin, desertion.
Because the evidence was insufficient
Judge Seawell yesterday denied the ap
plication for divorce filed by James
Gardner against his wife Annie. The
husband charged her with cruelty, con
sisting of her habit of going out . at
night with strange men. In his com
plaint he said that she was away from
home once for three days and nights
*nd in April last she left for good..
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted a
divorce to Charles Teshner from his
wife Kathleen. They were married at
Ked Bluff on February 10 last and the
husband showed that his wife had said
that she only wedded him so she
"could blow -him and get a sealskin
racque." She refused to cook for him.
At that time Peterson alleged that
before starting on a trip to Europe he
deeded his property to his wife in order
that there might be no trouble over his
tr.tate in; the event he should' die
abroad. When he returned Mrs. Pe
terson refused to reconvey the proper
ty. In her suit of yesterday she says
that she is the sole owner of the boat
business and has been for three years.
She says that Peterson continues to
come around and pretend to direct af
fairs and that he will ruin the business
unless restrained by the court. She
charges him with cruelty and says that
his suit was only begun to annoy her.
She also cays that he has been guilty
of acts of infidelity with a woman un
known. The Petersons were married
at Sacramento fourteen years ago.
Elizabeth Peterson, wife of Henry C.
Peterson, familiar as" the owner of the
Peterson boathouse at the Folsom
gtreet wharf, has sued him for divorce.
The action is her way of answering
his suit of August 16, wherein he charg
ed, her with defrauding him out of his
business and property, worth 520,000 or
more.
Spouse Claims to Be Owner
of the Profitable Business.
Other Domestic Matters
A million of dollars will- be annually
saved to this State by dispensing with
the costly ": sprays that -have been ap
plied five or, six. times annually to the
fruit trees 1 to destroy' the codiin- moth.
Other millions will . be" earned by the
great increase 'in production of the
trees when' the codiin -moth Is made
scarce. Countless millions, taking the
world at large, may therefore~be added
in a comparatively short period to the
world's wealth by this discovery.
. The genuineness of the discovery. Is
vouched for .by the fact .tliat, the apple
orchards , that are . the > habitat of the
newly found parasite bring 95 per cent
of their fruit to maturity. In California
and in all other portions of the world
hitherto the product of the world's ap
ple and pear orchards -has not been
more than 30 per cent to 35 per cent of
the promise at setting. ,
The discovery of the codiin moth's
destroyer, which has been sought in
vain for many years, therefore means
that the' world's output of apples- and
pears can be made, reliably and regu
larly, about 'three times its present size.
There will be three good pears and
three good apples In all parts of the
world 'where there now is one of each.
The apple and the pear are to be found
In all parts of the world where the cli
mate is temperate. The codiin moth
is also to be found all over the. world.
The vicious insect causes apples and
pears to be wormy and false at heart
and to . drop prematurely from the
trees.' It preys on apples and pears
with equal and impartial diligence and
has. been a destroyer of these luscious
fruits for centuries. Its reign is draw
ing to a near end.
Mr. Compere' has sailed from West
Australia, acting under the direction of
Ellwood Cooper, to forward to this city
the first colonies of the codiin moth's
tiny but invincible foes. Here the colo
nies will be Cultivated. Billions of the
parasites may easily be raised here un
der favoring conditions. From San
Francisco the colonies may be for
warded to all parts of the world. Cali
fornia will receive the first benefit nat
urally. It is said that wherever the
codfln moth lives the codiin'' moth par
asite will also thrive, regardless of ex
tremes of temperature. Consequently
the discovery becomes at once of
world-wide importance. The first of
the codiin moth parasites will probably
arrive at San Francisco before the ex
piration of the present year. The work
of multiplying the parasites will at
once be prosecuted. There is food
enough for them in this State. The
success in propagating other beneficial
parasites demonstrates in advance that
the newest ' parasites will -vastly Jn-.
crease here. â¢ Â¦ \
The most Important discovery that
has ever been made for the. benefit of
horticulture Js announced. Thepara
gite that destroys the codiin moth has
been found in South .' America by
George Compere, who > is : : employed
jointly by the" State of California,
through Horticultural Commissioner
Cooper, and by West Australia, , to find
beneficial insects that are born to prey
upon those that are injurious. .
