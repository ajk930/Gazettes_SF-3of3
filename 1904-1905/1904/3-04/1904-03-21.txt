CONSTANTINOPLE. March 20.â
The Russian and Austrian embassies
to-night renewed their pressure upon
the Porte to accept unaltered the
Austro-Russian scheme of reforms in
Macedonia. The Russo-Austrian note
pointed out that the counter proposal
of the Porte made on March 17. which
objected to the placing of foreign of
ficers In command of the gendarmerie,
in -Macedonia, did not tally with Tur
key's original acceptance of the re
form scheme. The note warned the
Porte of the grave consequences that
would follow any further delay.

YINKOW, March 20.â Two Americans
who arrived at Newchwang on Satur
day from Vladivostok say that half the
population there was unaware of the
recent bombardment until the next day.
No damage was done. All the women
and children have left the place.
The Americans could see a few sol
diers between Tsalchow and Neweh
wang, but witnessed no preparations
to defend the former station or the
railway line. Forty miles north of
Newchwang one railway bridge was de
fended by a single gun. South of that
point nothing had been done.
Harbin and Mukden are swarming
with troops, who seem to be coven
trating there. .
VLADIVOSTOK, March 20. â The
Russian military plans are progressing
satisfactorily here, along the main coast
and at Saghalien Island. Many inhab
itants continue to migrate to Khab
arovsk and Nlkolsk. and some women
and children are returning to Russia.
The first detachment of the Red Cross
from Russia has arrived and ha3 been
distributed among the field hospitals.
More than 100 nurses have been sent
from here to Manchuria and Korea.
The delivery of Russian malls to the
frontier and to ports is working fairly
well, and the telegraphs excellently.
Letters reach Vladivostok twenty-two
days after leaving St. Petersburg.

Describing the bombardment of Port
Arthur, the same day, the correspond
ent asserts that more than 100 shells
fell in the town. The effect of the great
shells from the twelve-inch guns must
have been appalling. Outbreaks of fire
were seen and the report of an explo
sion was heard, which it Is surmised
occurred in one of the magazines of tha
forts. Â¦
BOMBAKDMENT
OF VLADIVOSTOK

, The ; fight lasted nearly an hour. The
.weakness of the Â¦ Russian torpedo-boat
destroyer armament again proved- fatal.

RUSSIAN. ARMAMENT WEAK.
On the Japanese side one- destroyer
was hit on the water line, two : of her
compartments were flooded and her
quick-firing ammunition was wetted.
This vessel retired from the actldn. Her
officers...- escaped r narrowly from a
twelve-pound shot, which struck the
platform In. front ".of Â¦the bridge, killing
one man and sweeping the bridge .with
splinters. -The same vessel received a
three-pound shot through" the hull, but
the damage was repaired Â¦ within four
daysl - . - Â¦Â¦ .. ,; "y*v, "!
. .A Japanese lieutenant who boarded
the Stereguschtche^said.he had never
seen a more sickening sight. Thirty
bodies, terribly mutilated by a shell,
were lying on the deck. As the Japa
nese, approached \ two Russian bluejack
ets Â¦â¢ rushed from the conning -tower,
locked themselves in the cabin aft and
refused . to come out. Two stokers
jumped overboard and were" picked up.
These, with ; two wounded men, were
the -only 1 survivors of a crew, of flfty
five. SS5lSÂ£93tl3S3B
Describing the fight between the
Russian and Japanese torpedo-boats,
the correspondent confirms the report
of the fierceness of the contest. The
vessels were so close that the Russians
threw charges of explosives on the
bridge of one of the - Japanese boats.
These, however, failed to detonate. All
of the - vessels engaged were more or
less damaged. The Japanese losses
were six killed, and eight wounded.
That the Russians were defeated in
spite of 'their superior numbers is due
to the better shooting of the Japanese
and the fact that the Russian vessels
were armed % with three-pound guns,
while the armament of the Japanese
ships was made up of six-pounders.
In reference to the fight of three
hours which occurred later, the corre
spondent says the Rusians fought with
desperation and the Japanese with con
fidence born of their past victories.
One Russian commander was killed
early in the fight. A lieutenant then
took - command, ' only to fall, shot In
both legs. Then the command de
volved upon the sub-llentenant, who
also was shot and killed after taking
the wheel himself. When the cock
swain fell -this vessel was captured by
the Japanese. The other Russian ves
sels escaped.
RETIRES FROM 1 ACTION.
The correspondent says that Vice Ad
miral Kamimura's bombardment of
Vladivostok was solely intended to
harass, the. Russians and compel the
Russian cruisers to leave the harbor.
The vice admiral brought his ships
within opposite range of the dead point
of -the forts on the northwest entrance.
The Rusians did not reply because the
Japanese vessels took up a position be
yond the arc of the training of their
guns. 1 Vice Admiral Kamimura, the
correspondent says, sailed south on
March 11 after searching Amur Bay.
' Since Vice Admiral Makaroff's ar
rival at Port Arthur, he adds, the Rus
sian defensive-tactics have been more
active, and their torpedo-boat destroy
ers more alert and enterprising.
EVERY VESSEL DAMAGED.

graphic storr.- of the battle at
Port Arthur on Mareh'9.~ He says that
Admiral'. Togo, has been comparatively
passive, according to the last advices,
and that "Port Arthur has been given
a respite, although the cruisers and the
torpedo-boat destroyers have kept up

DUBBED -THE CO8SACK OF THE SEA": THE OFFICER WHOM txE HAS DIS
PLACED, AND A WAR SCENE ON L.IAOTUNG PENINSULA.
Treese has been in the city for
about seven. months and is employed
by Byron Jackson. Mrs. Butler
stated at the hospital last night that
she had only known Treese a month
and knew of no one that would shoot
him out of revenge. In telling her
story she said that they did not see a
pistol in the hand of the highwayman
when he stopped them and It was
only after Treeso started after the
fellow that she saw the weapon and
so Informed her escort It is her im
pression that the thug again ran into
the alleyway where he first appeared
after firing the second shot. Â¦->
Detectives Graham; Fitzgerald. Bun
ner. Mulcahy, Freel and O'Dea are
working on the en s=e. . '
He is described as a young nian
dressed in a black coat, back derby
hat and dark trousers. Owing to the
darkness neither Mrs. Butler nor
Treese were able to give the police a
description that might lead to the cap
ture of thjp fellow.
At St. Joseph's Hospital Dr. Ander
son ascertained that the bullet had
gone through the left shoulder blade
from the back, but was unable to lo
cate it by probing. Treese's condi
tion, although serious, is not neces
sarily fatal. Detective O'Dea, who is
working on the case, stated last night
that the case did not look like one,
of holdup and intimated that revenge
may have played a prominent part in
the crime.
Upon being struck by the bullets
Treese considered it foolhardy to battle
further against odds and immediately
turned and ran to the drug store at the
corner of Twenty-second and Guerrero
streets. There Dr. Joseph Brady made
an examination of the wounds and ap
plied a temporary dressing. Upon the
request of the wounded man he was
removed to St. Joseph's Hospital.
The shots caused intense, excitement
in the neighborhood. Officer J. T. Gal
lagher, who was in the neighborhood,
arrived on the scene a few minutes af
ter the shooting, but could find no
trace of the footpad. Both Treese and
Mrs. Butler agree on the description of
the highwayman.
DESCRIPTION OF THUG.
During the enactment of this tragic
affair Mrs. Butler. pluckily remained
on the scene and followed the men
into the street. Not for a moment
did she lose her self-possession until
the shots were fired; she admits that
after that the only thing she remem
bers is running with Treese to a
nearby drug store.
Treese made a sudden lunge with the
umbrella and as he did so there was a
flash and report and the middle finger
of Treese's left hand was shot away
at the second joint. Treese whirled
around and, as he did so, the thug
fired a second time, hitting him in the
back.
The robber backed to the edge of the
sidewalk and said, "I told you to put
up hands." Treese pluckily started to
attack him again with the umbrella.
The ominous snap of the hammer of
the thug's pistol was heard, but the
cartridge failed to explode. By this
time both men were in the street.
Treese advancing and the robber re
treating.
Shortly after 8 o'clock last evening
while Treese and Mrs. A. Butler were
walking down the south side of Twen
ty-second street, between Dolores and
Chattanooga streets, a fellow weariner
a white handkerchief j across his face
stepped out of a dark alley * /and j'or
dered them to throw up their, hands..
Instead of complying' with* tWT reauest
Treese, who - is a - powerful man. dealt
the thug a blow across the arm with
an umbrella he was carrying. .
ROBBER FIRES SHOTS.
Failure to comply with the peremp
tory command, "Hands up," and an at
tempt to give battle to a footpad last
night, may cost E. J. Treese, an iron
molder, his life. As the result of the
encounter he now lies in a precarious
condition at St. Joseph's Hospital, with
the middle finger of his left hand shot
away and a bullet hole in his back.
This crime by one of the murderous
crooks that now infest the city oc
curred in one of the thickly settled sec
tions of the city, but as usual there is
no clew to his identity and the police
are working in the dark. The fact that
his intended victim was accompanied
by a woman did not deter the thug
from attempting to carry out his plans.
SOUTHAMPTON. March 20. â The
American line steamship . New York,
Captain Young, from New York March
12 for Plymouth, Cherbourg and South
ampton, met with two mishaps to-day,
grounding off Cape La Hague, France,
in the early morning and later coming
into collision in the English Channel
with the Peninsula and Oriental steam
ship Assaie, under contract " to the
British Government and used as a
troopship bound for Bombay with 500
troops on board.
The New York grounded while ap
proaching Cherbourg at 2:30 o'clock
this morning during a fog. The sea
was smooth, however, and the tide was
on the flood and within an hour and a
half the vessel was floated without as
sistance. Her bottom was damaged
and there was water in the holds, but
she was able to proceed.
During the voyage up the channel a
dense fog descended. When off Hurst
Castle, England, the Assaye suddenly
appeared -and. it- was found Impossible
to avoid a collision. The New York's
bow crashed Into the Asaie's star
board bow, tearing a great gap in that
vessel. The New York's bowsprit and
figurehead were carried away an* the
latter was smashed into fragments.
There was great excitement on both
vessels. The boats of the Assaie were
lowered and the troops were mustered,
but the bulkhead of the troopship saved
her and the vessel was able to enter
Southampton and the New York was
docked at 6:30 o'clock for temporary
repairs. Nobody was injured. It will
be impossible to estimate the damage
to the New York until 6he has been
put into drydock.
It is believed that both vessels have
been seriously injured. Another ves
sel will replace the Asaie.
When the New York grounded at
Cape La Hague the passengers, who
were asleep, hardly felt the shock.
James Sellers, a passenger on the
New York, says that while he was at
luncheon there was a grating noise,
followed by a tremendous shock. Every
.one, he says, ran to the deck and It
was found that the New York's bow
was firmly fixed in the side of the As
saie. Sellers was close enough to ob
serve the marvelous discipline aboard
the troop ship. Not a second was lost
and there was no sign of a hurry and,
while the boats were being prepared
for launching, the soldiers were mus
tered with the precision of an orderly
drill.
"As, the vessels parted," concluded
Sellers, "we saw a gaping hole In the
Assaie ten feet wide and sticking ,on
our stem was a portmanteau and other
portable property. There was no panic
on our boat. Had we struck the As
saie amidships she would hare sunk."
The greatest damage has been done
by creeks overflowing their banks and
inundating hundreds of acres of young
fruit and vegetable farms. All over the
county thoroughfares have been great
ly harmed, by washouts and sinkholes.
Both the California -Northwestern and
the North Shore railroads have been
damaged by landslides. The precipita
tion for San Rafael and vicinity. up, to
the present time is 41.42 inches, against
HAN DIEGO, March 20.â Rain com
menced falling in light, misty showers
this evening at 8 o'clock, and, though
the wind was not right for a good rain,
the barometer was down and the pre
diction was for a good drenching be
fore morning. In the last twenty-four
hours .14 of an inch of rain fell here,
with the same sort of a fall through
out the southern portion of the county.
SAN RAFAEL, March 20. â The storm
which has been In progress fn Marin
County for the last several days has
done great damage in various sections.
It has be^n raining for several days
and thf* precipitation for San Rafael
and vicinity during the last three days
has been nearly eleven inches. To-day
a severe hail storm was witnessed near
Mill Valley, while to-night Mount Tam

wind storm which occurred here yes
terday did much more serious damage
than was at first thought. About 600
Yeet of the fence around the Lewis
and Clarke Exposition grounds was
blown down and in some instances
the boards were carried several hun
dred feet. The wind unroofed the
grandstand in the baseball park, tore
the porch from the clubhouse and
razed part of the fence. A house was
blown down in South Portland and a
large warehouse which had Just
reached completion on the east bank
of the Willamette River was demol
ished. Shade trees were uprooted in
every direction. Telegraph and tele
phone communication has been par
tially restored, but it will be several
days before the damage is entirely re

STORM VISITS PORTLAND.
Rain fell stea/My to-day and the
storm continues to-night. Much water
is Cowing through the break in the
South Yuba levee and the country is a
sea of water for miles. The damage
from this will, however, be lieht. Wa
tÂ»r over the Fifth-street grade between
this city and Yuba City is five feet deeo
end boats have taken the place of
Ftr^t cars. It is thought that the
Yuba River will establish a new hurh
water mark of twenty feet before she
falls. No alarm is felt in this city at
this time.
MARY6VILLE. March 20.â A north
bound extra freight train from Sacra
mento to Red Bluff went Into a ditch
near Reeds, six miles south of
this city, shortly after 10 o'clock this
morning, the engine, tender and one
freight car turning completely over. At
that hour water was running over the
track and the embankment had been
undermined. The engineer and fire
man escaped by swimming to the
shore, having Jumped from the cab
when they felt the engine leave the
rails. Their escape from death Is con
sidered miraculous. About 500 feet of
the track had been washed away, the
current being very swift. Flood water
from Reed Slough, which had over
flowed its banks and was flooding that
Feet ion for a distance of over a mile,
caused the wreck. Water from the
break In the south levee of the Yuba
River also Joins this stream and much
of ihe track is inundated. It will be
impossible to raise the engine and tend-*
er until the water recedes.
The Yuba and Feather rivers have
reached high water mark again and
are slowly rising. Marysville rests se
curely behind her magnificent levee
system, but Is shut out from all outside
points by the torents that are
flowing on all sides. No trains arrived
in this city to-day excepting the south
bound Red Bluff local, which was un
able to proceed farther on account
of the washout near Reeds, be
tween this city and Wheatland. The
Knights Landing and Oroville roads
are inundated for several miles and
Tvathouts are reported. The company
has large forces of men at work, but
traffic will not be resumed until the
water recedes.

REDDING, March 20. â Three
masked men armed with a revolver,
shotgun and rifle held up Dave En
dicott's saloon at Kennet at 1 o'clock
this morning, securing $100. There
were fifteen men in the place when the
robbers entered. They were forced to
line up lacing the wall. While the
two highwaymen kept the fifteen cov
ered with their weapons a third went
through the pockets of the victims
and also robbed the money drawer of
its contents. When the men left they
warned all present to remain in the
saloon fifteen minutes under penalty
of death. It is believed the robbers
are the same men who have been
committing saloon burglaries during
the past few months in small towns
north and Â«Â¦â " of Redding.

LOS ANGELES. March 20. â The
Chatsworth Park cut-off, which re
duces the distance between this city
and Santa Barbara on the coast line
of the Southern Pacific by ten miles
and puts Oxnard on the main line,
was opened to traffic to-day. This will
reduce the running time of limited
trains op the coast line by probably* a
half to three-quarters of an hour and
will obviate the congestion of traffic
between Los Angeles and Saugus, with
which the railroad company has fre
quently to contend. Train No. 21.
known as the Coast Line Limited, was
the first to pass through the Chats
worth tunnel over the new cut-off.
For the present only coast line pas
senger trains will be operated over
the new S route â¢ and a few through
freights will be diverted that way. Ul
timately all southern traffic will come
through the new tunnel, leaving the old
San Fernando route for the San
Joaquin valley service.
The great tunnel on the Chatsworth
cut-off is over a mile in length and
has required several years' work of
putting it through the mountain. Ac
tual construction has been in progress
on this tunnel since 1899. . Picturesque
scenery is an attraction along the new
route to Oxnard.

There will also be private cabinets
of gold specimens which will be very
valuable and attractive. From present
appearances it is more than probable
that the beautiful cabinet of specimens
presented to President Roosevelt by
Nevada County during his visit to this
State last spring will be secured for
the exhibit. This Is the most superb
cabinet of gold specimens ever pre
sented to any official. The cabinet was
made of manzanita wood. It contained
more than $2500 in gold and was by far
the handsomest present the President
received during his entire trip through
the West.
The agricultural, horticultural, lum
ber and other industries of the county,
and in which it is known to excel, will
be fully displayed. The mining men
and others realize that this is Nevada
County's opportunity and they are de
termined to make the most of it No
similar area in the world has produced
the same amount of gold that stands
to the credit of this county. Since the
discovery of gold In 1848 In this State,
Nevada County has produced nearly
$300,000,000 of the yellow metal, a record
unparalleled in the history of America.
The first gold quartz ever discovered
in California was found witnln its bor
ders. The deepest mines ,and tho
richest veins in the State are located
in Nevada County. The largest hy
draulic mines and the richest gravel
channels yet , discovered In the world
are known to exist there.
The county is also rich in other min
erals.- Recently large deposits of cop
per have been encountered and hav*
been found to contain copper as rich
as any in the State or country.
Nevada County will have an exhibit
of resources at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. This has been made possi
ble through the liberality of the Super
visors and the untiring energy of the
Nevada County Promotion Committee.
The former recently made a large ap
propriation for the maintenance of the
exhibit. At a meeting of the Nevada
County Promotion Committee Samuel
Butler, editor of the Grass Valley Tid
ings, was selected to manage the ex
hibit. It Is the intention of the'Super
visors and the committee to make this
the finest display ever sent from any
county in the State to any great inter
national exposition. The mineral dis
play alone will exceed $10,000 in value.
It will be by, far the best mineral ex
hibit ever sent from this State by any
county. In addition to the general
milling ores which will constitute the
exhibit there will be some very hand
some cabinets of specimens. Nevada
County is noted for rich specimen ore
and this will be very much in evidence.
There is provided a magnificent cabi
net, 21 feet long and 11 feet high. witH
a depth of 18 inches. The shelves of
the cabinet are of glass and the -back is
lined with mirrors. This cabinet has
been constructed especially for miner
als and will make a handsome sight
when filled with the precious metals it
is made to contain.

With the moving to St. Louis of the
entire force of the California Com

of California, who are intensely inter
ested in getting benefit from the
money appropriated by the State and
by the counties and by private enter

measures of promotion that will
there be employed in the State's be
half.
VIEWS ARE SELECTED.
Much will, however, naturally depend
upon the literature and other auxil- !
iaries that are adopted to convey an '
intelligent understanding to the minds \
of spectators. Counties will have lit- â¢
erature that is devoted to the facts and ;
resources in their respective localities, i
Special industries will also have their |
own distinctive literature to distribute. |
The California State Board of Trade !
hae provided a way to give to the!
world a comprehensive knowledge of !
California as a whole, so. that the en- !
tire glittering domain between the Si- j
erra and the Pacific Ocean shall be |
pictured firmly in the minds of mil- j
lions who have never seen California. |
but who may be induced to come to j
this State to live.
Some allusion has been made in The
Call to the annual report that was re
cently submitted to the State Board I
of Trade by General N. P. Chipman, j
the president of the board. An ar- I
rangement will be made to have all the j
great array of facts contained In that
able document put before all who come |
rear California's exhibit at St. Louis.
A great edition that will probably |
number hundreds of thousands of cop- !
ies will be put through the press in I
order that gratuitous and reliable in
formation may be dispensed largely
during the entire exposition season at
St. . Louis.
If the opinion of the California Com
mispiontrs is correct, then California
has secured an exhibition that will sur
pass all others that have preceded it
end that will give to the people in at
tendance at the exposition an adeauate
Idea of California mines and minerals,
horticulture, agriculture, viticulture,
education, art, timber resources, etc.
The offices of the California Commis
eioners to the St. Louis Exposition have
been closed. The next step that will
be taken to advertise the resources of
California to the world throuKh the
agency of the exposition will be the in
rtallation of the exhibits that have
been prepared in this State. Much has
been scid concerning these exhibits.
In the exhibition hall of the State
Board of Trade sharp rivalry may be
stimulated between California counties^
by the progressive action of Tulare
County. . The large hall in the Ferry
building houses the exhlbitB from many
counties, and horticulture, agriculture,
viticulture and varied California in
dustries are there exemplified. Care
has been given to the method of instal
lation that the special products of the
State may be so attractively displayed
as to prove first-class advertisements
for the sections that they repreent.
Tulare County has discovered in
these conditions a chance to do good
â¢work for itself. The county has long
had an exhibit with the State Board of.
Trade. Now a combination of cir
cumstances has' given Tulare' County
one of the greatest collections of prod
ucts that any individual county in
California has ever possessed. These
were gathered for the purpose of mak
ing an exhibition at the St. Louis Ex
position. After the work of.prepara
tion had been performed, It was decid
ed that Tulare would not send Its coun
ty exhibit to St. Louis. The result is
that a magnificent display , for the
county is now. available for use in this
city, where it will be seen, by; at least
10,000 persons per month -on the aver
age, throughout the year. The display
will; be made a permanent attraction
in the exnibition hall > of the State
Board of Trade in San Francisco.
During the last weekÂ» A. E. Miot

with the management of the State
Board of Trade in reference; to the in

decided to locate in Sonoma County,
where he will Invest 55000 in the poultry
or orange business.
The success of the California Promo
tion Committee is shown by the number
of persons it has been influential in
.bringing into the State to settle. Thus
a recent report of the committee says:
It is confidently believed by the State
Board of Trade directors that this prac
tical advice, coupled with the great ar
ray of material and reliable facts con
cerning the State that are contained
in the president's report, will r be the
means of securing direct communica
tion with thousands of thoughtful men
who have already become impressed
by the show of California's products
in the mines and mining, agriculture,
horticulture, forestry and education
buildings of the exposition. Probably
no better device has ever been adopted
to attract and hold attention than the
combination of exhibits and literature
that will be In view and in ready reach
of the Inquirers for facts at St. Louis.
Another matter that will be exploited
by the State Board of Trade under the
heading heretofore given is transporta
tion. On this point it is set forth that
"the Sacramento Valley has railroad
facilities from San Francisco to Red
Bluff on both sides of the river, where
the roads unite and proceed to Oregon.
Competing railroads traverse the San
Joaquin Valley, namely, the Santa Fa
system and the South Pacific Com
pany's lines, connecting Northern and
Southern California, and the Southern
Pacific Company has a coast line from
Los Angeles to San Francisco. There
are three overland roads centering at
San Frandncoâ the Central Pacific, via
Ogden; the Southern Pacific, via South
ern California and Texas, and the San
ta Fe system in Southern California,
Arizona and New Mexico. Nearly all of
the leading roads in the East have
representatives in San Francisco com
peting for the through travel and
freight. Two railroads are operated
through the north coast counties from
San Francisco, one terminating now In
Wllllts, Mendocino County, and . the
other at Cazadero, Sonoma County.
One of 'these is to be extended by the
Santa Fe system to Eureka, Humboldt
County. -
"There Is rapid transit by numerous
lines to points not far distant
fronv San Francisco, and South
ern' California is being gridlroned
around Los Angeles by electric
roads. Many electric roads are in
operation . about i Fresno, Stockton â¢ and
other points in the. northern and cen
tral parts of the State. There is also
the open sea, via Cape Horn," and be
fore many years the isthmus route will
be available. The sea makes it also
possible to. reach competing overland
roads in Oregon and Washington."
"It la generally desirable for the
homeseeUer or investor to be put in
communication with one or more re
liable persons in the town or district
preferred. This can usually be ac
complished through the California
State Board of Trade, which is always
ready and willing to help intending
settlers in any way it can."
"They should also make known
their needs with reference to church,
school and social privileges; whether
they are willing to locate some dis
tance from towns or expect to make
their homes near towns and villages
and whether they wish land improved
or unimproved. If they have prefer
ence for any particular part of this
State they should name the county,
and the information in respect to the
particular district may be easily given.
"Difficulty is often experienced by
the California State Board of Trade
in replying: to inquirers because of in
definiteness of inquiry. Questions
concerning climate, industries and
resources would be generally satisfac
torily answered by this report, but
when specific information is desired,
that can only be given by letter. In
quirers should therefore state their
present occupation, what they wish
to do on arrival in California, wheth
re they are married or single, whether
they wish to engage in farming or
other branches of business. They
should state, approximately, the sum
of money they wish to invest and, if
they are seeking homes in the interior
on farms, they should write as to
what branch of farming they wish to
engage in.
ADVICE TO INQUIRERS.
One extract from General Chip
man's report, of which no mention
ha* been heretofore made, but Which
is considered of value in addressing
possible settlers, relates to transpor
tation facilities, land values, labor
demand, cost of living and sugges
tions to persons wishing information
about California. One passage under
this heading, that the State Board of
Trade will call to the attention 'of the
public from abroad, is in full as fol
lows:
be many pictures of this sort which,
it is supposed, will have a better ef
fect upon those who look them over
than would a greater number of views
of the more conventional and hack
neyed sort that deal with scenes in
special industries.

The confession vof a North Yakima

the desperado. Sheriff Grant and local
officers tracked Gingle yesterday and
located him in a lonely cabin in Union
Park addition.
Gingle lived alone. The officers
watched the place all night, forming
for the attack this morning just before
daybreak. When Officers Doak and
Pugh kicked in the door of the cabin
and sprang inside, yelling "Hands
up!" a form on a rude bunk at the op
posite side of the cabin stirred and one
hand was seen to rise. Then came the
report of a heavy revolver. Gingle

officers both returned the fire and Push

as the latter changed his gun to his
left hand and began shooting again.
As Officer Pugh bore down on his
man he felt a tremor pass through Gin
gle's body. Doak had stopped shoot
ing, and as Gingle's revolver dropped
from his hand the outlaw groaned and
gasped for breath. . The other officers
had rushed ' in and were striking
matches while Gingle was dying. Two
bullet wounds in the body and one in
the leg had done their work.
When the body was laid out it be
came apparent that Gingle had ex
pected an attack. Around his bodv.
over his underclothes in which he
slept, was strapped a belt filled with
revolver and rifle cartridges. The
heavy revolver which he used so des
perately was drawn from this belt when
the officers entered the cabin. Beside
his bed stood a rifle with the magazine
filled with cartridges.

His death was the result of a surprise

President Angus M. Cannon of the
Salt Lake Stake of Zion, referring in
the Mormon Tabernacle to-day to his
confinement in the State prison for
polygamous cohabitation some years
ago, described himself, as being "im
prisoned for the testimony of Jesus."
He said:
"When I was out there on the hill
(at the ; peDitentiary for polygamous
cohabitation), imprisoned for the tes
timony of Jesus and testifying to the
teachings of God, I wrote to the
mothers of my children to teach them
obedience to the will of God. I wrote
them, 'Men cannot build walls so high
or prisons so deep as to shut out the
spirit of God.' "
Mrs. Elizabeth Kompe, a German
immigrant recently arrived here, ha3
set forth In an affidavit what she al
leges is the treachery of the Mormon
elders. She says in her sworn state
ment that she was induced by Mormon
elders to leave her husband and come
to Utah, and since coming here she
has been in dire straits, which the
Mormon people have not tried to al
leviate. She also avers that she was
offered polygamous marriage by the
mormon elders, Hottendorf and Huef
ner, after arriving in Salt Lake. The
woman has been ill at the Holy Cross
Hospital for some time. She declares
that these two Mormon elders told her
that she need not mind the fact that
she had 6. husband in. Germany, as
when she was baptised into the Mor
mon church the baptismal water acted
as a divorce.
SALT LAKE. March 20.â Young Mor
mons throughout the State of Utah
have united in a movement having for
its object the enforcement of the
pledges given to the Government when
Utah became a member, of (he sister
hood of States. These young Mormons'
are particularly vehement in their as
sertion that the law must be obeyed by
the members of the Mormon hierarchy
as well as by other citizens. As a re
sult of this movement,' which already
numbers some 500 young men in its
ranks, the practice of living with
plural wives by the high officers of the
Mormon church must be abandoned or
else these young Mormons will leave
the church. This is the ultimatum that
is to be given to the Mormon hierarchy
at the general conference of the saints
to be held here next month.
These young Mormons are thoroughly
American, and they are not at all
pleased by the notoriety which the
State has achieved as a result of the
disclosures at the Smoot hearing. It is
said by this element that the younger
Mormons were as much surprised at
these disclosures as the Gentiles
of the East. At all events the move
ment has been started to force the
church to make good its promises made
at the time Utah was admitted to the
sisterhood of States. The denouement
will come at the April conference of the
saints. Then, it is declared, the young
Mormons will serve notice on the gov%
eminent body that they will leave the
church in a body unless President Jo
seph F. .Smith and other leading Mor
mon high priests cease to violate the
law by living with their plural wives.

a battalion of a WelsM regiment, num

yesterday at Howick, Natal. The bat
talion was on the way from PretQria

The officers had tried -vainly to
maintain discipline, but the men got
entirely out .of hand. They carried
their arms into Howick, raided drink

wild scenes of rioting and soon there
were forty-one casualties.
. The mutineers spread over a circuit
of two miles, taking possession of
houses and pillaging and terrorizing
people.

The French Government has already
transmitted to Tokio Russia's protests
against the seizure of Russian whaling:
vessels wintering at Nagasaki before
the expiration of the date fixed for the
departure of Russian vessels from Jao
anese ports. To this Japan replied
that, a prize court having passed upon
the question. It was no longer a diplo
matic one, but that the owners had a
right to appeal to a superior court.
Russia refuses to take this view, and
asks France to renew the protest.
Count Lamsfiorff, the Russian For
eign Minister." considers this to be a
violation of the laws of war. notably
of the twenty-fifth clause of the Hague
convention, to which Japan was a sig
natory. The Minister, therefore, asks
France to call Japan's attention to the
matter, apart from the general protests
contained in the recent Russian note to
the powers.
PARIS, March 20.â The Russian em
bassy has received from St. Petersburg
and has handed to Foreign Minister
Delcasse, for transmission to the
French Minister at Tokio, who Is
intrusted with the protection of Rus
sian interests in Japan, a protest
against an alleged infraction of the
laws of war. It appears that during
the attack on Port Arthur on March

Â¦ VALPARAISO, Chile, ( March 20.â The
Chilean Times reports the consensus of
native opinion as growing in bitterness
toward the United States. The semi-
J official journals of Santiago, by their
attitude en the Panama question, have
encouraged the anti-American senti
ment, which became so pronounced as
to force an abandonment of the project
ed Chilean exhibit at St. Louis, "for
reasons of economy," but on the same
date the resolution was taken it was
announced that in 1910 the South
American Exposition will be held In the
capital, "to celebrate Chile's independ
ence and demonstrate the advancement
of the republics of Latin. America dur
ing the hundred years since It was ob
tained."
The leading Valparaiso papers com
pliment the administration upon its ac
tion in holding off from the Louisiana
Purchase Fair as commemorating the
beginning of the American imperialis
tic policy of expansion â "which can
only be looked upon with distrust by
Latin republics of the continent and a
menace to their future political exist
ence."
It is intimated that Chile will at
! tempt the formation of an anti-impe
j rialistic league by republics which ac
cept an invitation to take part In her
projected exposition In 1910, with a well
defined anti-Yankee programme.
FRANCE TO MAKE
PROTEST AGAINST
JAPANESE ACTION
The Queen City left Victoria the week
befcTe last on her usual trip and has
not been spoken or reported since. She
was due Thursday, but no anxiety was
felt until Sunday morning. The Queen
City goes as far north as Cape Scott
and Quatslno Sound, t SomeÂ«of the
roughest waters of the coast lie be
tween these points and the Strait of
Fuca. The Queen City is about four
hundred tons.
The Queen City is a low-speed boat,
and it is feared that in the gales which
have been raging all along the west
coast north of Cape Flattery she was
driven ashore, as the wind has fre
quently reached a velocity of sixty
miles an hour.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 20.âCap
tain Troup, manager of the Canadian
Pacific Navigation Company, to-day
asked Captain Gaudin, representative
of the Department of Marine and
Fisheries, to send out the Dominion
Government steamer Quadra to look
after the steamer Queen City of the
company's line, which is now more
than four days overdue from the west
coast ports of Vancouver Island. Cap
lain Gaudin immediately ordered the
crew of the Quadra summoned and
steam raised on the vessel, which sail
ed to-night on her quest, taking with
her a couple of newspaper men. She
will carefully search all the coves and
inlets from Race Rocks northward In
the endeavor to locate the missing
steamer.
Serious alarm is felt here because no
word has come from Clayoquot, Barn
field Creek or Cape Beale about the
Queen City, all those points being con
neeted with Victoria by telegraph. The
officials this morning held a consulta
tion as to what should be done, and It
was decided best to apply to the Do

Libby and Hoff say that the winter
at Vladivostok has been exceptionally
mild. The sea has been frozen only
six miles out from the harbor entrance
and the Ice-breakers go out every
morning, returning at noon, clearing a
channel. Coasting vessels were running
in and out of the harbor without dif

Russian fleet was anchored in the har

quite a long period. The Russians, lust

blocked and the railway between Vlad

considerable distance, they were com

1000 miles to the nearest port on the
Korean cbast. They were arrested at
the Siberian-Korean frontier, where
there was great trouble about their
passports, and where they were in dan

platform, bowed to them and imme

Katsura advanced to the throne and
handed . the address to the Emperor.
The latter read it in a voice low but
firm, which carried to every corner of
the chamber. It was as follows:
"We hereby open the Imperial Diet
and address each and all of the
members of the House of Peers and the
House of Representatives. We an
nounce with high' satisfaction that our
relations with the treaty powers are

are especially urgent in connection with
the situation and- which we have or
dered the Ministers of state to lay be

The members remained with bowed
heads until. the reading was concluded.
The president of the House of Peers
then ascended the: platform, advanced
to the throne and received the address
from tho Emperor. The â¢ Emperor
stepped to the front of the platform,
bowed, left the chamber and .returned
to the palace.
The other galleries were filled with
Japanese civil officials and- military
and naval officers. No women were
present.

Lrong before the Emperor reached the

occupied the right side of the chamber,
and the Commoners, all in evening
dress, filled the left. The seats, which
occupy rising tiers, had been removed,
and the members stood in semi-circles,
with the presidents and vice presidents

TOKIO. March 20.â With stately cer

Mikado - Opens a
Special Session
of the Diet.
LONDON, March 21.â Nothing has
reached here to confirm the report that
a battle has taken place on the Yalu,
in which the Russians are alleged to
claim that they captured 1800 prisoners.
A dispatch from St. Petersburg to a
news agency, dated yesterday, says
there has been no change in the situa
tion and that all is quiet on land and
sea. Along the Russian line from Ping
yang to the Talu River and the Japa
nese line to Gensan there have been
slight skirmishes between scouts, but
no battle has taken place, as the dis
tance between the opposing armies is
too great. The bulk of the Russian
forces, the dispatch adds, has not yet
passed the Yaln.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Daily Telegraph says that the mili
tary authorities werf startled by the
attempt of the Japanese to land in
Helena Bay, as the nearest Russian
force that could have been used against
them consisted of three rifle regiments
at Newehwang. A storm having hin
dered the Japanese landing, energetic
measures are now being adopted to
prevent such a descent. Among the
other devices adopted has been the con-
centration of troops at Foochow, twen
ty-two miles south of Helena Bay.
In cabling the fact that all British
and American residents at Newchwang
must remain within the walls, the cor
respondent of the Daily Chronicle at
Newehwang says:
"I vras arrested while attempting to
leave yesterday."
"The correspondent says It is* rumored
that a Japanese squadron arrived at
the mouth of the Liao River on Sun
day night and landed a party which,
after reconnoitering, re-embarked.
A correspondent of the Times at
Newehwang cables as follows:
"According to information received
here, the reason the Vladivostok forts
did not reply to the bombardment by
the Japanese was because the batteries
were not provided with guns. Since
the bombardment parties have been
working night and day to place the
guns in posjtion. The bombardment
destroyed the Linievitch battery. The
Russian losses were slight because the
batteries there are deserted. The same
conditions prevail at Vladivostok as at
Port Arthur. The supply of provisions
there is running short and the popula
tion is panic stricken. The ice is con
sidered the only real protection." â¢

MOSCOW, March 20. â Owing to the
discontinuance of the trips of the
volunteer fleet steamships no tea is
coming from Ceylon by water. The
practical suspension of freight trains
over the Trans-Siberian Railroad
makes it almost impossible to get tea
from China. One merchant, who has
20,000 chests of tea en route in Man
churia, offers to sell it at a nominal
price to the Government for the use
of the soldiers. Because of the-diffi
culty in delivery here the merchants
have decided as a last resort to return
to the old Mongolian caravan route
through Kiakhta and will petition the
Government to afford them facilities.

"May you have a long life and a hard
death; I would like to give you the
contents of a revolver," Is the threat
against the Rev. William Rader in an
anonymous letter recently received by
him.
It was in a sermon at the Third Con
gregational Church last night that the
Rev. Mr. Rader mentioned the fact of
his having received a threatening let
ter which was the outcome of a sermon
he preached Sundav night, March 13,
in which he scored agitators and
bluntly asserted that San Francisco is
full of anarchists; is full of people that
do not love this country, nor this coun
try's government.
On that occasion the Rev. Mr.
Rader declared that those that Insult
the Government of the United States
and those that Insult the flag of this
country should be deported, and he
continued by saying- that men that In
sult the Stars and Stripes are not
worthy Its protection.
Anarchy, he also declared, was in
disguise in the city under a "sweeter
name," a "more sugary guise," and he
pictured the mourning that had over
taken the nation through the assas
sination of three Presidents.
The subject of the sermon preached
last night was "The Leavening of the
Nation." "... .
Rev. Mr. Rader said in part:
A man sine against the Holy Ghost when
he becomes Impervious to truth, by prejudice
and bigotry.
One Is appalled sometimes at the attitude of
men toward the gospel. How frequently I
receive letters of condemnation for speaking
the simple truth. These letters, of course, are
unsigned and are consequently, from men who
are bad.
A man who would write an anonymous let
ter is oar>able of murder; is capable, I say,
of any crime of the calendar.
For the Â«ermon I preached last Sunday I
have received one letter which Illustrates the
hard mind.' In this tetter the writer politely
exrresses the desire to give me a "lead pill"
and wished me a "long life and a- hard death."
I hope he is here to-nlgnt. If I â¢ were called
ux> at any hour of the night to help him, or
any other man, I would give my strength to
serve him.
That Is what I am in the world to do. but
these threats ere anarchy, not against me per
sonally, b'.it acalnst God. against the church,
against the truth and against the Government.
How shall the church make itself felt against
euch dreadful threats in this beautiful city.

CLUB TO TEACH
HOME BUILDING
One of the features of the concert
â¢will be the motion songs by some fifty
primary girls. They will be dressed in
costumes of white canvas and blue
ties and trimmings, and dance and
motion to the singing of their friends
of the higher classes.
So much rain has fallen that the
grounds leading to the Greek Thea
ter of the University of California are
in a deplorable state, and unless the
rain ceases for the rest of the week it
will be necessary to wait. A postpone
ment is a thing the managers wish to
avoid, as it will demoralize the sine
ers and the singing, too., Mrs. L. V.
Sweesy, who is training the voices,
said to-day that not until the middle
of the week could she say what would
be done in this emergency.
The children have been carefully
trained for this concert. First they
were practiced in their various schools
and then as a whole. The initial re
hearsal of the 500 children was held
yesterday and was entirely successful.
The programme for the day will be as
follows:
"Columbus. Glorious Nation," chorus; scngs
of the season, chorus; "An Apple "Orchard in
the Spring," "Spirit of Summer Time," "The
Golden Rod," "Snow So Fair." Primary
songs, Longfellow school â "Sailor Song,'
"Summer": Southern sores, chorus â "Suwa
nee River," "Dixie Land," "Old Black Joe":
MeKinley Glee Club â "The Children's Armr," r
"The. Finland Song"; sacred songs, chorun â
"Cast Thy Burden." "Christmas Seng," "Oh,
for the peace"; primary songs, Longfellow
Schoolâ "An April Child," "Froggries* Swim
ming School"; Scotch pongs, chorus â "Blue
Bt-llB of Scotland," "My Heart's in the High
lands." "Bonnie Dundee"; Whittier .Boys'
Club â "Styrlan Song." "Jolly School of Boys";
slumber song?, chorus â "O, Blue Eyes,"
"Lullahy." "Cradle Song"; patriotic songs,
chorus â "Star Spangled Banner," "America."
BERKELEY, March 20.â The man
agers of the concert to be given by 500
school children for the benefit of the
fund to furnish the juvenile room in
the new Carnegie Library are in doubt
as to whether or not they will let the
concert go on next Saturday, the day
fixed for the big festival of music.
Having failed to negotiate, the club
has abandoned that plan of campaign
and will attack the legality of the pro
ceedings under which the franchises
were granted, and John Yule, the at
torney and president of th<Â» club, has
made a report on that phase which de
clares that there are three fatal errors
which invalidate the franchises. This
report, with a petition from the inter
ested property owners to postpone final
action on the franchise ordinance, will
be presented to the City Council to
morrow night.
This offer is considered a prohibitive
one by the club's committee which had
the* negotiations in hand. Macdonald.
the committee declares, has admitted
that the cut-off franchise is of no use
to his principals â that they could not
utilize it. On the other hand, the Tran
sit Company desired it simply to im
prove the Fourth avenue service into
Peralta Heights and the contiguous
territory. The two franchises involved
are merely new connection* between
the Fourth avenue branch and the main
line on East Twelfth street. No other
company could under any conditions
find the slightest practical value in
these 'franchises except for speculative
purposes.
Macdonald's offer to make the assign
ment is considered by the club as evi
dence that the privileges are not of
service to his principals for road-con
struction purposes. The College avenue
franchise might be made valuable as a
feeder for the "corkscrew" franchise
out "Webster street, which is in Mac
donald's name.
The Peralta Heights and Boulevard
Improvement Club has failed in ita
move to get an assignment to the Oak
land Transit Consolidated of the Fourth
avenue cut-off franchise, which was In
cluded In a blanket purchase of fran
chises by J. H. Macdonald, representing
principals who have not made public
their identity. Macdonald has demand
ed for the Fourth avenue franchise one
third of the $8300. the total amount at
which he bid in these and the College
avenue privileges.

All this is to cost $200,000. that is. if
the Town Trustees decide that it must
be done. Engineer Huggins suggests
that the best way to pay for it is by
the district plan, each district being as
sessed for the benefit that will be con
ferred upon it.
The rains c-f the last month have
demonstrated that the sewers ought to
be laid, for whenever there was a heavy
rain the sewers overflowed throughout
West Berkeley, making it disagreeable
and unhealthful for the people living
in that section of the twn. The sew
ers were uuilt for a town much smaller
than Berkeley and naturally the in
creasing growth of the city has finally
resulted In the overtaxing of the pipes.
City Engineer C. L. Huggins has hit
upon a new plan for draining Berkeley
of its surplus waters and diverting
them so that they will not repeat the
immense damage to property that was
â¢inflicted this year. In substance, the
plan consists in four big storm sewers
that will be built in the bottom of the
natural waterways of the town, on the
principle that it is easier to follow the
lead of nature than it is to create new
ways. (
It will be possible to use but three
of the natural drainage systems, as
there is no system adequate for the
purpose in one of the sectionsâ South
Berkeley. One of the three sewers will
be laid in School House Creek in North
Berkeley, another in Strawberry Creek
in Central Berkeley and still another
in Derby Creek in South Berkeley. The
fourth will be laid in an artificial be"d
along either Tyler or Woolsey street.
Immense pipes, large enough to carry
off the surplus no matter how thick the
population or how heavy the rain will
be laid. These will probably be- three
feet in diameter.

Richard Cornelius, president of the
Street Railway Men's Union of San
Francisco, delivered an address this
evening at the socialist headquarters
on the subject of "The Citizens' Alli
ance vs. the Trades Unions." Repre
sentatives from nearly all the labor or
ganizations in this city were present; a
large number of the members of Car
penters' Union No. 26 having attended
the lecture in a body. Mr. Cornelius
contended that the only way for the
labor unions to meet the issue which
the organizing of the Citizens' Alliance
had brought about was to go into busi
ness on the co-operative plan. He said:
We are living In an age of organization,
and in order to live we ipuM perfect our own
organization. Xever before In th<? history of^
the world was- society so thoroughly organ
ized. We are fed by an organization of pro
vision dealer?; we are clothe by an organi
zation of dealers in sho<idy. for seldom indeed
is Ihe workin^raan able to buy anything but
nhoddy. and lastly, if by eome chance a
Â».'orkingman Is ahle to build a home of his
own. he is confronted by the lumber trust.
All that now remains la for the laboring man
to have a trust that he may meet the other
trusts on even frnxs. and now. when the
workingrnan begins to organize for â¢self-pro
tection, he in confronted by the Citizens' Al
liance, which eayg, "\\> ar* out to destroy
you unless you He down and be good dogs."
Tlierr- are on'y two way*, lie down or fight
back, and I for one am- going to fight back.
Organized labor is going around In a circle,
but with "very revolution the circle is getting
wider, and more .worklngmen are being brought
into the ranks of organized labor. Now jhe
Citizens" Alliance has come just about the.
right lime. Not that th<Â» Citizens' Alliance
amounts to much, for it does not. but if the
f-omlng of this mushroom growth ends in forc
ing the union man to go Into business for
himself I for one nhall thank God for the
Citizens' Alliance. If I had my way, the
union!" would conduct their own stores, and
then the union man could defy the power of
such organizations as the Citizens' Alliance.
Herbert George faid that the labor
unions were all bluff and that if the employer
would only stand firm the laboring man would
take ofT his hat. Well, time will prove Â¦wheth
er or net that is so. In my opinion there is
nothing to the Citizens' Alliance but bluff and
bliiFter. It flgilres that enough union men
will turn traitor to their principles to. allow
the employer and the business man to win
out. but if the workingmen stand together the
employer cannot hurt them and they will havs
nothln~ to fear from the Citizens' Alliance,
l^t the union men start a co-oyeratlve store
of their own and put their best men at the
hea>] of it and as their capital grows let them
extend their business *and t^ey will soon find
that thÂ»y can do without the men who are
mÂ«-mbors= of the Citizens' Alliance, and when
these nvn low the support of the laboring
men it will n^.t be Ions before they will be
looking for a job, po?Â»!bly from the very mÂ»n
whom- they wftld now force to the wall by
means of the Citizens' Alliance.
The plans for the next rally of the
"Oakland Boosters" are now com
pleted, and the meeting will be held
ii^xt Tuesday evening at "Ye Liberty
Hayhouse."
'ihe raliy Â»tll be held after the close
cf ihÂ« regular performance, which will
be slightly shortened to accommodate
tho s=jÂ»eakers at the rally.
Thfe "Boosters" will gather in the
chapel of th4 First Presbyterian
Church, and will enter the theater by
the stage door on Franklin street.
While the la^t art of the piay is being
finished the speakers, among whom
are the Rev. E. It. Dille. the Rev. E. E.
Baker, Rev: Father AlcSweeney. Coun
cilman A. H. Elliott and James P. Tay
lor, will take their places on the rear
of the revolving stage, and immedi
ately on the fall of the curtain' the
stage will be turned, brinjons: the
speakers fate to face with the audi
ence. The present campaign of the
"Boosters" is for the proposed bond
Issue, and on Tuesday evening the
ei>eak<TS will point out the great bene
fit that will accrue to the city of Oak
land if the bonds are authorized.
The members of the Oakland Real
Estate Dealers' Association are also
working for thr bond issue, as they re
alize that if th*Â» proposed public im
provements are t-ceomjiliFhed property
will increase in value and at the same
time will be in greater demand. Twen
ty-five members of the association en-
Joyed the hospitality of the Press Club
at luncheon yesterday afternoon, and
the following committee has been ap
pointed to draft resolutions of thanks
to the members of the club on behalf of
the association: Charles Taylor. Henry
Dodge and James S. Naismith. The
Real Estate Dealers' Association has
created the office of assistant secretary,
and yesterday afternoon Ellis E. Wood
was elected to fill the position.
Real estate dealers report little busi
ness during the past week, the almost
steady rain having kopt prospective
purchasers within doors. Dealers are
confident, however, that as soon aa
the weather clears up the market will
be better than ever before in the his
tory of Oakland. Lost week was the
first this year that the inclement
weather has interfered ivith the realty
market, business during the preceding
â¢week having been unusually brisk.
Hyde & Hirges, contractors, are

On the back of this note he had
written that weakness and illness as a
result of an operation for appendicitis

capacitated him for work. "I am very
well connected," he wrote, "probably
better than any one In the theatrical
profession. Last season I played a

critics were loud in their praises. Mrs.
Coe addressed the Pioneer Daughters

she gave "Parsifal" with oral and

The address of the afternoon was by
Dr. J. D. Hodgen, professor of dentistry

his subject "The Chemistry of Ra

On Tuesday last the California Club
heard a charming dissertation upon a
subject dear to all womankind â laces:
somehow, laces are so intricately inter
woven with loves that apart from their
infinite beauty they appeal to all
women. Mr. J. P. Weil gave to the club
of his generous store of knowledge,
illustrating his explanations with sam
ples of the laces under discussion. Fol

the happiest of the season â came the
following reports from sections: Lit

"On with the clubhouse!" is the slo- !
pan cT the California Club, and behold
the splendid unanimity in the launching
of the big projectâ for who is there in
the club that doesn't gaze upon that
yawning Sacramento-street lot with
irr.apTir.ativo longings for a fireside
thereon? And now at last the initia
tory step has been takenâ the die is
crust. For on Monday last the build
ing committee and board of directors
unanimously decided that the time was
r.ow rips for building, and enthusiastic
discussions of plans, architects, costs,
ways axd mean and other vital Ques
tions ensued. Mr. Pissis came recom

with ideas â and unlimited 'patience â so
be was accordingly chosen to draw the

It bo shockingly difficult, as there are
many level-headed Â¦women on that
building committee (Mrs. Hovey, chair

all know a thing or two about business
methods.

mitted on Tuesday to the club at large
ar.d the matter went through with a
whoop â the clubhouse became a thing
cf reality In the short 6pace of a half
hour. And Mr. Pissis, the patient archi
tect, is now busy upon the plans. And
may success attend him! The money
to be raised is $35,000, which sum is sup
posed to cover the cost of the new
home.
With matters progressing: satisfactor

its fall term in its own new home â the
first club in San Francisco to own its

5THE irrigation experts of the Department of Agri
culture at Washington and the agricultural college
at the University of California have reported that
their work of surveying the Fresno alkali lands, which
has been carried on since the "summer, of 1002, has now
approached so near completion that actual work upon
the construction of drainage canals may be inaugurated
at any time. Their estimates place the cost to the State
of these necessary drains ' at $260,000, and their report
assures the ranch-owners about the southern city that
with, this expenditure there will be reclaimed from
aridity several thousand acres of valuable orchard and
grain lands. ,

cided to kill me and I want to protect
my life. The truth of the matter is that
she is hopelessly insane, and to bring

THE Agricultural Department desires to locate an
extensive tree and plant experiment station near
Chico. This is for the purpose of serving the in
terests of the fruit planters and ranchers of Northern
California. The department is continually searching the
world for trees, vines and plants that will add to the
varieties now in cultivation and use. It also uses such
experiment stations as schools of instruction in the best
and most improved methods in horticulture and agri
culture. The experts of the department desire to aid
the people of California in making the best and most
profitable use of the natural resources and climate of
the State.
In many vays such a station is useful. It will dis
tribute the fig wasp, the blastophaga, to the end that
the Capri fig, which preserves the wasp for its work in
fertilizing the Smyrna fig, may be available in the Sac
ramento Valley and in the, foothills, to which niany
believe we must look for 'the best dried fig supply. It
is known that the variety of our nut crops may be
greatly extended. The true filbert will flourish here if
properly planted and cared for. Its crop is important.
We now import great quantities of this nut, which
comes into favor as the wild hazel nut disappears from
the East. The Irish filbert is but little known here and
is not often seen in the market. But it is a large nut
of excellent quality, and if its planting be promoted by
such an experiment station it may be made to occupy
land that is not in action for any other profitable pur
pose.
The best variety of the pistache nut can also be do
mesticated here, and it is the purpose of Mr. Swingle
of the Agricultural Department to introduce it as soon
as this station furnishes proper facilities. The large
pistache is 'used as we use the almond. The tree has
the advantage over the almond of being a late bloomer,
when the rains cannot interfere with it. The nut is now
imported for use in confectionery and also as -a table
nut at a high price. California can produce it in quan
tities to supply the American market. Our great suc
cess with almonds and English walnuts should induce
our planters to encourage everything that will add to our
variety of nuts. The proposed station will be used also
to enlarge our varieties of deciduous fruits. Having
the best fruit climate in the world, we should never abate
the effort to use it up to its full capacity in the kinds of
fruit that we may. raise.
It is to be hoped that the people of Chico will see the
importance of this opportunity and enable the depart
ment to secure the desired location. . They were liberal
to the State in the location of the Normal School, and
we venture to assure them that this experiment station
is not second to that school in its importance to them
and to all Northern California. They can afford to.be
liberal. Their locality has recently felt the impulse of
progress and has received large numbers of well satis
fied settlers from the East. The advertisement it will
get from this proposed station will warrant them in
donating to it the land it requires. /
I China has created marked concern in the capitals
of the world by seizing the first opportunity for freedom
from international treaty restrictions to order enormous

preserve the "administrative integrity" of the Celestial

Anrd'ers to Queries.
George Dalton Morgan, who has
brought from the Orient a Japanese
bride, told the other day a story about
the Japanese seafighter, Admiral Uriu.
"In Tokio," he said, "Admiral Uriu
Ik regarded as a â¢ kind of Haroun al
Raschid. . They declare there that he
investigates personally â sometimes
even . in disguiseâ every . detail of the
workings of the Japanese navy. Hence
many odd adventures befall him. â¢
"Once Admiral Uriu got wind of cer
tain complaints that had been made
against the soup served on a torpedo
boat in his squadron. He shot from
his flagship in a launch one day at
meal time and boarded this torpedo
boat just as two sailors came from the
kitchen carrying a huge and steaming
caldron.
" 'Halt!' the admiral shouted. 'Set
that caldron down.'
"The sailors, with wondering looks,
obeyed.
"'Now,' he said, "bring me a spoon.'
"Ati officer hurried forward.- â¢
" 'But, admiralâ' he began.
" 'Never mind, sir. There's a com
plaint from this boat, and I'm going to
settle it now,' said Admiral Uriu.
"He lifted the lid from the caldron,
ladled up a spoonful of its contents,
and. after blowing on the liquid, he
swallowed it. Then he made a wry
face.
" 'You call this soup?' he exclaimed.
'Why, it is nothing but dirty water.'
" 'Yes, sir,' said one of the sailors;
'we have just been scrubbing the galley
floors.' " â Buffalo Enquirer.
A True Criticism.
AN EXPERIMENT STATION.
The Japanese-Russian war has come, as a boon to
those, of our fellow citizens that love to spread their
learning in . glittering generalities before a wondering
public! The conflict to them is bristling with potenti
alities of world disaster, but after we reduce the clash
to its lowest terms and to its most sensible expression
it is nothing more or less than a case of grab and greedi
ness on the part of two nations.
"This world Is a mighty queer place."
said a prominent merchant the other
day, as he sat at lunch with a number
of his business associates. "A little
thing happened to me this morning that
makes me think that if a few of us
would do a little more thinking and act
less hastily the inhabitants of the world
would be better off.
"Almost twenty years ago, when I
first started in business here and had
but a small store on Battery street, a
young man, or rather boy, came into
the place and asked me if I could give
him something to do. As I was only
doing business enough to support my
self and one clerk I felt compelled to re
fuse him work, and told him so. He
was insistent, however, telling me
that he only wanted pay enough to buy
food and clothing. He said he had been
all over town looking for work without
success, was without funds and needed
a place badly. 'I have recommenda
tiones,' he finally said, offering for my
perusal a bunch of letters. I did not
look at them, and finally had to tell him
that I was too busy to listen to him
and walk away from him. He stood for
a few minutes, and then with his head
hanging walked out of the store.
"This morning that young man, now
in his prime, walked into my store as
the representative of one of the largest
ctothing houses in the world. As one of
the -firm, he came to see me about a
businss deal that meant much to me â
in fact, meant the life or death of my
business. I sought for concessions, but
he was like adamant, and finally after
a business talk that lasted for several
hours he left the store, saying as he did
so, 'I will give you until noon to de
cide."
"When he came for his answer I gave
it to him, consenting, of course, to the
terms he dictated. It was when the
cantract had been signed that I learned
who my sharp opponent was. He told
me of the little incident that happened
in my office twenty years ago, and said
that after leaving my place he had
gone to the water front, shipped for a
voyage around the Horn, landed in New
York and secured employment with the
firm which he now represented and in
which he was one of the junior part
ners."

War correspondents are book writers
in reserve; and this is their chief
function in modern campaigns. In
South Africa the censorship was so
rigorously employed that the English
press did not receive any adequate re
turn for its enterprise and the enor
mous expense of the service. The spe
cial dispatches were mutilated at head
quarters and held back by the block
ing of the cable lines; and the public
was dependent upon the offi
cial dispatches for information, and
these were condensed and often ren
dered unintelligible by inscrutable pro
cesses of revision at the War Office. At
critical times, when there were British
reverses of when important movements
like Lord Roberts' march to Kimberley
and Bloemfontein were impending,
London was the best center of news,
because there was more or less leakage
from official sources. There was a
legitimate cause for complaint on the
part of the English people, who were
paying heavily for the war in blood
and treasure. They were intensely in
terested in the campaign, yet were not
allowed to have an intelligible account
of it from day to day; and this was
not in consequence of any lack of en
terprise on the part of the London and
provincial journals. The press was
well represented by a competent staff
of correspondents; but the military
censors were most arbitrary in their
methods, and the dispatches were held
back and clumsily edited and condensed
by officers who were without the train
ing and judgment requisite for an in
telligent discharge of their functions.
Good descriptions of battles were re
served for the mails, and were not
printed until a month or five weeks
after the fighting was over. â New York

Prospecting and locating of mining
claims are in no way interfered f* with
by reserve regulations, for the mining
laws apply exactly as on the public do
main. Settlers and others are allowed
free all the timber they use. Reser
voirs, roads, stores, and similar enter
prises are permitted 'upon application.
Grazing by sheep and cattle is permit
ted with only such restrictions as prove
recessary to preserve the range and
protect settlers, or others having rights
4 â Regulation, as far as practicable,
cf grazing and timber cutting so as to
prevent waste and utilize the full pro
duction of forest and range.
o â Protection of young growth so as
to Insure a future supply.
If sufficiently large and tveil dis
tributed areas can be held as re
serves, only the mature Umber cut,
and the young growth protected from
fires, there is no reason why lumber
ing should not be a permanent and
profitable industry. Small mills scat
tered over the timber districts will
perpetuate local prosperity, and' the
price of lumber to the resident will
be low. Without reserves the pres
ent tendency toward syndicate own
ership of all commercial timber is
apt to result not only in wasteful use,
but in the disappearance of the small
mill and in high prices for lumber.
Almost if not quite as important
is the relation of forest reserves to
mining, ". -ilch absolutely requires an
immense amount of timber and a sus
tained supply of water. In all cases
its profits depend directly upon the
cheapness of these commodities. With
out protection from fire, and from en
terprising lumbermen who may ac
quire all the timber around them and
ship it out of the States, many im
portant mining camps are certain to
be in serious straits in a few years.
One of the objects of forest reserves
is to preserve the timber for its logical
users. Resex~ves do not make it more
difficult for miners to secure timber, for
prospectors are allowed free use of all
they need ard large concerns can pur
chase as cheap or cheaper than from
private speculators. There is no inten
tion of working hardship on legitimate
Industries, for the desire is simply to
secure the following objects:
1â Maintenance of the area Intact
under one management.
â¢3â Establishment of fire protection.*
3 â Preservation of resources for local
use.
A trip through the white pine
States of the Great Lakes region, or
through a hundred other once forested
districts of the world, will convince
any man of the short sighted abuse of
timber resources, and of the effect of
attendant forest fires on permanent
prosperity. For a while times are
good: towns and railroads are built;
farms are cleared and prosperity is
evident everywhere, but it does not
last. Only the best timber is cut,
while millions of dollars' worth of
poorer material, which in time would
be worth quite as much, is destroyed
by fires. These fires also kill all young
growth and seed trees and eventually
turn the land into a desert, which is
abandoned by its owners and does not
even pay taxes. The mills are moved
away, the towns abandoned, the far
mers find themselves without a mar
ket, and the enterprises, and some
times even the counties, which were
built upon such unstable foundations,
become bankrupt. This is not theory;
it is history written in lumber district
after lumber district, not only'all over
the United States, but throughout the
world.
The lumbermen were not to blame;
it was only the natural outcome of
conditions which obliged them to con
duct their business in this way or lose
money. The private owner of tim
ber often cannot afford to do" other
wise. But the Government can, and
this Is the reason why every civil
ized country in the world, including
our own, has adopted the forest re
serve system.
The possible uses of most forest
r.reas are manifold. They may in
clude the production of lumber, or of
mineral, or of pasture, or the conser
vation of water. One of these func
tions may be the most Important or
all may be fairly well balanced, but
in any case the industries and Te
f ources of a region, or a State, should
be considered as parts of a whole,
each contributing to and sharing the
general good. Practically every Im
portant industry in the intermountain
States, whether mining, agriculture,
grazing or lumbering, depends for its
existence upon the forests of these
States, and the forests can serve all
these interests bes=t only if placed un
der a management which will prevent
u"due promotion of one at the ex
pense of the aggregate good of all.

Before any discussion of the forest
reserve question in the West there
should be a clear understanding of the
Government's policy in creating and
managing these, reserves.
Through ignorance of this policy,
possibly justified in some measure by
occasional mistaken interpretation of
it by overzealous or incompetent of
ficials, many citizens have objections
to reserves which thev would be the
first to drop if they understood the
true situation. The Government has
but one aim in creating forest re
serves â the best permanent use of the
land by the people and the prevention
of waste of any of its resources.

Away sailed the navy to the south
ward, bent on an errand that should
sustain the honor - of the Hawaiian
flag and the prowess of the Hawaiian
bluejacketâ if he wore a jacket.
A month passed and the month wore
into two months, with not a word from
the seat .of war. An anxious monarch
scanned the blue horizon with weary
eyes for a sign of the fleet. Not a
sign, until along about the eleventh
week came a message that the navy
was In distress off Hilo. Explanations
followed soon afterward. Everything
had gone well for a few days until the
crew had consumed all of the square
bottle gin it had taken aboard, when
the cruise began. They could not fight
without gin and to get it the brave
tars were ready for any sacrifice. Su
they put into Hllo. They traded the
brass cannons for more gin and for
eleven weeks held out against no worse
a foe than the seductive distilled strong
waters from Holland. The navy re
turned In disgrace. The admiralty
went out of business and the flag was
lowered on the only ship in the navy.
For many years thp Kaimialoha was a
hulk in the Honolulu harbor, the last
and the only man-o-war the royal
family ever owned.
This is the true 3tory of the Royal
Hawaiian Navy. It was in the days
of the kingdom. Some one at the court
of the dusky islanders conceived the
idea that Hawaii Bhould be graced by
a navy. This was particularly desired
because King Kalakaua had a row on
hand with his brother monarch at
Samoa. So a navy was acquired.
The navy consisted of a converted
teak wood trading; schooner fitted with
a third mast and full rigged. The
Hawaiian admiralty provided the naVy
with a lot of old brass cannons, en
listed a crew of natives and forthwith
sent them out to battle with the ob
streperous Samoans.

The tendency in wheat and cor- has been toward

have been almost wholly due to the Armour deal, owing
to its purely local character, but Armour is now said to

prising, as the current wild activity in cotton there would
naturally run up the volume of clearings; but a gain of
20 per cent at Minneapolis, which has been sending in
complaints of a stagnant market for flour, with the mills
preparing to close down if the inquiry does not improve,
is rather paradoxical. The failures for the week were
229, against 220 last year, but with the single exception
of the Sully collapse, were not of serious importance.
Apathy still prevails in Wall street. Speculation is
at a low ebb and the break in cotton, with the failure of
its bull leader, is regretted by the banking and other
financial interests, who fear that it will give the public
another fright and effectually check any further aggres
sive bull movement in stocks for the present. Consid r
erable disappointment is express :d, for the stock market
was showing signs of awakening activity, and within the
past few days there has been a "welcome drift in quota
tions toward a higher range of values.
All this recovery and buoyancy seemed swept away
On Friday, however, and the general stock market sym
pathized with cotton by going off a point or so, with a
disposition to realize all along the line. The depression
may prove merely temporary, however. At any rate,
two or three days will probably tell the story. Condi
tions are certainly, in favor of a better feeling in bonds
and stocks, as the great financial interests publicly an
nounce that they have released all checks upon an up
ward movement in prices and, indeed, are quietly advis
ing their customers to invest in good dividend-paying
securities. Money continues abundant at reasonable
rates and readily accessible to solvent borrowers, and
the financiers say that the chances for profit at the pres
ent plane of values are larger .than those for losses.
Hence the panic in cotton came as a wet blanket to
Wall street.
The above conditions show a satisfactory state of
trade throughout the country, taking the situation as. a
whole. California continues to make a bright showing,
as the drenching rains now sweeping over the State,
while doing more or less damage along the river bot
toms, almost injure abundant crops of everything this
year. . Â¦ . _ ,
Both of these "features are encouraging, as they
presage more activity in the steel trade, which has been
languishing of late, and which, when dull, exerts, a de
pressing influence throughout the country, and vice
versa. A third welcome feature was the moistening of the
great wheat fields of the Southwest, where a prolonged
season of dry weather was beginning to damage the
crop. This was partially offset toward the close of the
week by a dry dust storm which swept over .Western
Kansas and Oklahoma, doing more or less injury to the
growing plant in that region.
The leading feature, of course, was the panicky break
in cotton, which carried with it over the dam the lead
ing bull operator, D. J. Sully, whose holdings were about
300,000 bales. The disaster occurred on Friday and in
the frenzy to realize the day's sales were run up to about
1.500,000 bales. Brokers were astounded by the enor
mous offerings, as the cotton came pouring in upon the
market from all queers. It was a deluge of cotton and
the market went d(^vn as if there were no bottom to it.
Just what effect this' great break will have on the cotton
manufacturing industry remains to be seen, but the re
sults will probably manifest themselves this week as
soon as the cyclone has cleared off.
Another feature of the weeic was the decisive vote by
which the bituminous coal miners decided to accept the
proposed reduction in. wages without declaring a general
strike, which would have worked great mischief to the
manufacturing industries at the very moment they were
commencing to revive. Another important feature was
the continued improvement in the iron and steel trades,
which showed an expansion in the movement and a cor
responding steadiness in quotations for most descrip
tions.
THE revival of activity in general trade noted a week
or ten days ago was still more pronounced last
week and the whole line of domestic commerce
showed more animation. The weather was riot' of the
best, and storms, more or less severe, checked the dis
tribution of goods in many sections, notably on the Pa
cific Coast and especially in California, but on the. whole
the business situation was encouraging throughout the
country.
BUSINESS STILL EXPANDING.
While it is true that many of the
earlier reserves were established with
out investigation sufficient to prevent
the inclusion of some agricultural land,
this is impossible under the present
system. Now the land is carefully ex
amined and mapped and the lines are
drawn to exclude all considerable areas
susceptible of settlement. Small agri
cultural areas are provided for in the
legislation just recommended by the
Public Lands Commission. This sys
tem removes one of the strongest argu
ments which has been made against
reserves. A no less welcome change
Â¦will be the proposed new policy of re
ducing' control from "Washington to a
minimum and placing more authority
in the hands of local officers who are
familiar with their State conditions,
and will thus be free to conduct the
business promptly and acceptably to
the people, unhampered by red tape,
unnecessary restrictions and delay. To
accomplish this end a bill has been In
troduced in Congress to transfer the
reserve management to the Bureau of
Forestry, in the Department of Agri
culture, and Its passage will result in
an immediate revision of the many
cumbersome and restricting regulations
which have caused dissatisfaction.
These two changes will remove prac
tically all objections which are. now
urged against forest reserves. In short,
the object of the Government is not to
blot these areas off the map, but to
protect them from fire and to manage
them so the people can get more from
them than they do now.
of priority and equity, from outside
competition.
Even though this destructive operation of the laws of
nature is due to the presence of irrigation canals it be
came evident to the experts from Berkeley, who first
undertook the study of the situation, .that since " the
waters from Kings and adjacent rivers were absolutely
essential to the continued fertility of the country, irri
gation could not be dispensed with, and the only remedy
which could be brought to bear would be that of drain
age for the alkaline seepage water. Upon an appropria
tion of $15,000 made by Congress in the summer of 1902
Professor Elwood Mead of the University of California
and also head of the Bureau of Irrigation at Washington
went down to the southern fruit district to direct the
work of a party of Government engineers in platting the
contour of the country and determining the proper steps
to be taken for the creation of an elaborate drainage
system. C. G. Elliott, who has remained to complete
the work inaugurated by Professor Mead, announces in
his report that drains from five to seven feet in depth,
and laid out in half-mile parallel lines will rid the low
country of the destructive alkali.
With the remedy for, this destruction of acres of the
richest fruit land in the State now found to be prac
ticable by the experts from the Washington agricul
tural bureau it remains for the State to set to work im
mediately upon the construction of these seepage chan
nels. Each season which brings with its alternate damp
ness and sunshine additional, strata of the noxious salt
to the surface renders more and more worthless land
which should be bringing forth its sown seed a hun-.
dred fold. :
the most peculiar anomalies presented by the modern
science of systematic farm productionâ that of too much
irrigation being a hindrance rather than a benefit to
the lands upon which it is applied; for the concentra
tion of alkali upon the surface soil has been a phe
nomenon coincident with the introduction of the irri
gation ditch system in the Fresno district. The physics of
the surface precipitation of the alkaline salts is sim
plicity itself. It is merely that the presence of a num
ber of irrigation ditches add greatly to the volume of
subterranean waters through seepage; the level of these
waters consequently rises until in, very low elevations
the surface of the ground and the height of the sub
terranean flow strike a tangent and the alkaline sub
stances in suspension in the waters are precipitated out
upon- the surface of the soil by evaporation.

to get into port, and a more battered

Second Mate Albert Maas had a ter

In speaking of the storm he said:
"The gale struck us just as though it
had been fired from a gun. There was
no warning about it at all. It hit us in
a bunch, threw the ship on her beam

struck the petitions between the rooms
and smashed them as though they were
paper boxes. I was washed overboard
twice, and as I went over the first time
I caught the starboard fore sheet,
when suddenly the ship gave a tremen
dous pitch and rolled me back again.
Before I could grab hold of anything I
wns washed overboard a second time
and the sea threw me back against the

washed to the bilge pump. This I

LONDON, March 21, â The Daily
Mail's Hamburg correspondent says
that the captain of the Berwick Castle
is persistent in the assertion that it is
impossible that his ship could have
collided with the submarine boat No.
1 ' A, as the shock would have been
much more violent. He says he felt
only two very slight shocks and that
the atmosphere was clear and that he
saw no submarine boat.
PORTSMOUTH, March 20.â Attempts
were made to-day without success to
raise the British submarine boat No. 1
A, which was run down by the Donald
Currie line steamer Berwick Castle Fri
day afternoon. The principal damage
appears to have been done to the con
ning tower, which shows the marks of
the collision. The hull of the vessel ap
pears to be intact.
It has bee.n ascertained that the sub
marine's hull was also pierced. The
boat will be salvaged first by repairing
and then filling It with compressed air,
the position In which. she lies and the
currents having compelled a suspension
of the attempts to lift her. The divers
report that it is impossible to aee inside
the submarine. The opinion is that the
boat filled with water immediately.
The disaster to the -No. 1 A has cre
ated a most painful 'impression in all
classes. Queen Alexandra, the Duke of
Connaught and the chiefs of the Ad
miralty have sent messages of sympa
thy to the relatives of the victims. Ad
miral Fisher, in an official signal to the
fleet expressing sorrow, says:
"Practically our gallant comrades
died in action. Their lives were not
thrown away, if we consider their
splendid example of cheerful and en
thusiastic performance of duty, in
volving all the risks of war."
HAMBURG, March 20. â The Don

to meet so many at the exercise which
it had come to him to perform.
Following is a list of those who re

ents take into their homes newspapers
proper for perusal and not of a doubt
ful character. With regard to night
and mornihsr prayers, he wished that
the practice which obtained in years
pone by would be again continued gen
erally.
His Grace directed pertinent remarks
to the younger ones in the assemblage
as to their future conduct and spoke
especially of the sacredness of the
home and the duty that it owes to the
church.
Seldom has a more impressive scene
been witnessed in any sacred edifice of
the city than the confirmation of boys
and girls by nts Grace Archbishop
Montgomery in thÂ« Church of St.
Charles Borromo, yesterday.
The children were appropriately at
tired, the boys in black suits with rib
bon of white satin on their breasts and
the Misses in pure white frocks and
long lace veils, hanging: gracefully from
their heads.

Archbishop, attended by the Rev. Fath

the Rev. T. Moran, the Rev. Father
Philip O'Kyan and the Rev. Father E.
Looney, entered the sanctuary and the
exercises were begun with profound
ceremony.
After devotional exercises. Archbish
op Montgomery expressed his delight
at seeing so many youths present for
confirmation, which showed, he said,
the loyalty of the parents of the chil
dren to the church and to their paa

WASHING WITHOUT WAtEB
la Like Tryinsr to Get Rid of Dandruff
Without Kerploide. ,
Did you ever see any one trying to
wash themselves without soap or water?
If you did what would you say of him?
It is every bit as foolish to try to get
rid of dandruff and to prevent baldness
by feeding the germs which cause ' It,
with Cantharldes, Vaseline, Glycerine
and similar substances which form the
principal ingredients of most so-called
Hair Vigors.
Newbro's Herpicide Is successful . be-
cause it attacks and kills the parasitic
germ which feeds on the hair roots.
It is the original and only genuine

Prank Mitchell and Grant Smith Start
a Promisins Singles Matchâ The.
Day's Scores.
The tennis court3 of the California.
Club were covered with water most of
the day yesterday, but several of the
players by working energetically gut
the water off and played a few sets be
tween showers. Frank 'Mitchell and
Grant Smith started what promised to
be a fast and interesting singles match.
Both players were rather out: of prac
tice, particularly Smith, who had not
played for more than a month. Th3
first set was a lively and an extremely
close one. Smith finally won by an 8-6
score. The second set was - played in
the rain and Mitchell proved much the
better mudlark. In this set Smith
was unable to get a game, the score
being 6-0 in Mitchell's favor. ' r ; : -
R. B. Daggett and Harry . Gabriel
played two close sets, bot'u of which
went to the former by a score of 6-4.
Daggett has been practicing regularly
of late and there is a marked improve
ment in his game.
The only o'ther match played was a
one-set one * between Bradley Wallace
and H. Spring. Wallace won the set,
the score being 6-1.
The players are having the usua'
difficulty getting -used to the new.* balls
for 1904. The first, lot each year are
always lively and consequently hard
to stroke. They are a trifle larger and
heavier this year and will prove more
satisfactory than ever when the players
become accustomed to theml

Rev. John A. B. "Wilson, pastor of the
Market-street Trinity Methodist
Church, delivered a novel sermon to
his flock at the services last night. It
dealt with the labor question and was
the outcome of a letter received by Dr.
Wilson from the executive board, of the
Retail Clerks* Association of this city.
Following is a copy of the letter, which
Dr. Wilson read to those present:
Dear Sirâ Knowing you to be Interested and
In sympathy with all questions that affect
the public we. the Retail Clerks' Association
of this city, would like to have you "press
your views upon the subject of that for which
the association Is earnestly contending: namely
the uniform doeing hour for all retail stores
of Â« o'clock five evenings in the week 10
o'clock Saturday evenings, Sundays and legal
hO A I fs?' S wnat. d 1n 8 your r ?u t d C ment. should be the
right action for the Justice-loving public to
take oi this question. Yours very respectfully,
taKe Â° q THEODORE ROSENBACH.
Secretary No. 432. R. S. I. P. A.
The clergyman took the letter as a
theme for his sermon and spoke in part
as follows:
I am Blad of this letter: not only because J
KvrnnÂ«thize with this contention, which I
certafnly do but because It Is a* It should I be
for tsSL e people to come to the church of God
for an expression of active sympathy with
them In their most reasonable effort .to secure
lot themselves that which justly belong, to
everv man. Time was in the history of the
church when it afforded an asylum for every
nnÂ» In trouble. A man who had no oth*>r
friend ml>.ht find "shelter, food and protection
there I think it U not true to the extent
sunposed by-manv that the church his been
on theVlde of "Him that oppressed the hlre
llns In his .wages and that fear not me. salth
the -Lord." Sure I am that the Bible Is al
wa~Â« on the side of the poor in every just
ronVention. I want to thank these retail clerks
far knowing in advance that I would speak
for then? They are right: they know It: their
empleyers know it; the great patronizing pub
lic of this generous, fair-play city knows it:
and the three or four hotrs of employers who
would oppress their clerks to take advantasre
of their fair-minded llvÂ»-and-let-live com
petitors know that. their clerks are askine for
only what is equitable and- Â«ust. They know
also that they, themselves are swine, -with all
four of their feet In the trousb to host all its
contents They do not know that they are
coins to turn the trouch over, however, and
lose it all If. they do not become mori human.
If I knew, the' names of these shyiocks 1
should be strongly tempted . to let you know
As to what' the public* shouM do. " It seems
to me there is but one thing: namely, to pa
tronize the fair-minded merchants who .are
wiPinsr to accept a reasonabls day's work from
their employes, and on- no account to; patronize
the men who want it all and do not carp how
they get It. nor -at whose expense. Let us turn
their trough over. When the hours of closing
are uniform a hardship is worked to no one.
Â¦\Vhen some refuse to do so." then the others
are compelled- in self-defense, to keep open
also or suffer loss. I hate boycotts, but I love
fair play too well not to deplore lhÂ» ns trnn â¢
age of these :unfalr- storekeepers by this fair
play-lovln? public, of San Francisco.' It : not
only 'weakens the. cause of the' clerks, hut
shows JÂ» lack of appreciation of those who are
fair and. upright. I shall certainly request the
members of my family to limit -thelrypatron
age'to those who keep In good fntth Jhe hours
requests by - the . Retail Clerks' Association.
After all. the law of love taught by the Savior
Is the only true solution of these correlative
obligations. ' Thou shalt love thy neighbor
NEW YORK, March 20.â At a confer
ence held to-night by Senator Platt,
Governor Odell, the chairman of the
Republican State Committee, and many
other prominent Republicans, after an
exchange. of views and statements by
Senator Platt and Governor Odell, it
was unanimously agreed that Senator
Platt should remain as he has been in
the past, the active leader of the party.
It was further agreed that in contests
for leaderships in the party there
should be no interference in. favor of
or against any one either by Senator
Platt or Governor Odell.
The resultof the conference was
generally interpreted as being equiv
alent ; to a complete settlement of all
points at issue between Governor
Odell and Senator Platt, the basis of
the compact being the acceptance by
the Governor of the offer of â the
chairmanship of the State Committee.
This is said to have been the point
for which the Governor was contend
ing, and in return for the concession
he willingly:, conceded allegiance to
Senator Platt as the recognized leader
of the Republican organization of the
State. . _ ' . Â¦-../Â¦
Senator Platt after the conference
said:: ' - . -
"The atmosphere has been cleared
absolutely as a result of the plain
talk we had to-day. Republicans in
New York State had. good cause for
alarm up to noon to-day. It looked
as if the party might go \o the" devil,
butall that has been avoided, I do
not think anything could have brought
together the large number of leaders
from all parts of the State which met
with me tq-day and later met the
Governor/ aside from myself and one
or two others who put the success, of
the party, above, all personal consid
erations. " I shall return to Washing
ton to-morrow and about Wednesday
I intend to go 1p Aiken, S. C, for: a

'.'I have agreed to accept' the chair

Platt," he replied.

ROSE.. THE CALIFORNIAN,
ESTABLISHES NEW RECORD
Lowers the World's Mark in the Shot
Put, Which Has Stood for
Ten Years.
ANN ARBOR, March 20. â The phe
nomenal feature of the Michigan
freshmen-Detroit University/ school
track meet here last night was the
shot put event, in which Ralph Rose,
a varsity freshman, established a new
world's record with a twelve-pound
ball. He hurled the missile a distance
of 56 feet 3% inches and beat the
former record by 1 foot 1% inches.
This distance of 55 feet 2 inches was

STARTS BLAZE AT RUSS
Frightened Guests Are Soon Relieved
of Their Fears by the Timely Ar
rival of Firemen.
Smoke Issuing from one of the rooms
on the upper floor of the Russ House
caused ten minutes of excitement
among the guests of that hostelry yes
terday afternoon and resulted in an
alarm being turned in to the Fire De
partment. -
An investigation developed the fact
that a careless lodger had left- a lighted
Turkish, cigarette lying on a bureau,
down which flames eventually were
communicated to the carpet. The fur
niture in the room was rapidly taking
on a pyrotechnical appearance when
the occupant of an adjoining apart
ment scented smoke and, rushing out
into the hallway, gave the cry of
"fire," which aroused the entire hotel.
For a time there was a small sized
panic In the hotel, but the timely ar
rival of a chemical engine and the
prompt quenching of the blaze soon
pacified the guests, who returned to
their rooms and began to rearrange
their property, which they had hurried
ly gathered together preparatory tÂ»
flight. The damage was about $50.
BASEBALL NINES WILL PLAY
TO-DAY AT RECREATION PARK
Large Sundny Crowd Visits Eighth
Street Grounds, â¢ But Inclement
Weather Prevents Game.
All one needed to prove the eagerness
of the fans to see a ball game after the
long let-up in this city wtu. a trip to
Recreation Park yesterday afternoon,
where Chicago and San ' Francisco
were to have played the first exhibition
game of the season." With' only slight
intervals of clear weather the enthu
siasts still hoped a kind fate would de
cree sunshine at the last moment and
they went to the grounds In hordes de
spite the showers that descended for a
full hour before the time Tor play. At
2 o'clock it was seen the grounds would
be unfit for immediate use and the dark
skies did not portend a decent after
noon, so the crowd was turned back
and the ball tossers returned to their
hotels.
' Manager Harris had a little surprise
up his sleeve, however, and those who
wanted to see the big league club In ac
tion will not be disappointed i if the
weather will permit games to-day and
to-morrow. Manager Selee announced
that he was not due to appear against
Seattle at Sacramento until next Wed
nesday and could stay over here If
Harris cared to show on those dates.
Harris did care and the matches were
straightway arranged,* to be called at
3 o'clock. â¢/'. ";-T\0
As Harris may be able to dicker for
one or more of Chicago's extra men
the games, will have an added interest.
Selee has not actually given a promise
to that effect, but he has had several
long conferences with the local magnate
and it is known such a thing was dis
cussed. Otto Williams, the young la
fielder, who has been sougnt by several
of the major leagues. Is the one -most
fancied by Harris.
William Clancy, Oakland's new first
baseman, arrived from the East last
night and will Join the team at Hanford
to-morrow. He Js a raw-boned six
footer and comes with the reputation of
being an extra good man. Clancy was
to have joined the Chicago Nationals
this spring and $1000 was offered for
his release, but he chose to play in Cal
ifornia as he did not relish the Idea of
possible bench duty and could not see
where his . opportunity to displace
Captain Frank Chance was brilliant.

Wind Is That Can Be Desired, but
Rain Interferes With
Pastime.
The members of the San Francisco
Model Yacht Club picked a poor day
for the opening of the racing season
yesterday at Spreckels Lake, Golden
Gate Park. It was an ideal day for
racing as far as the wind was con
cerned, but the rain made it impos
sible to finish all the races.
The honors were carried off by W.
Roeckner's Apache, wÂ£ich won three
out of five races. Second honors went
to B. Jurgen's Bulletin, which won
the other two races.
The Apache also had the distinction
of making the fastest time of the day.
The Piute, owned by Forreft, made
the second best time. The Apache and
Piute are both scows, and not much
to be looked at, but their time was
much better than that of their trim
mer looking rivals.

A large crowd from this city visited
Jimmy Britt yesterday at his Alameda
training quarters despite the inclement
weather. The Californian went through
his work with a dash and snap which
indicated the high development of his
physical condition. He weighed 134^
pounds before he commenced his work."
In the morning he went on the road for
a short run. He did no boxing, and will
probably cut it out entirely to prevent
possible injury to his hands. He
punched the bag for some time and put
extra steam into his blows.
While Britt's muscles all show the
developing work to which they have
been subjected, the casual visitor is im
pressed particularly with his neck
muscles. These stand out in knots, as
though meant as a possible protection
against a knockout blow.
Britt's arms look big and his should
ers and chest are also impressive. He
has none, of the gauntness which it was
expected would show toward the end of
his training. When he takes off five
pounds, as he probably will have to do
to make sure of his weight on Friday,
he may take on a tucked-up appear
ance. Â¦-.;Â¦'..
He showed great strength yesterday
while roughing it with Frank Rafael.
He forced the latter all. around the im
provised ring and would not let him
make a stand.
Britt kept up a continual fire of fun
ny remarks while he was working. His
favorite proverb is, "The pen is
mightier than the sword, but the box
ing glove brings home the most
money."
Both Britt and Corbett were interest
ed spectators lastv night at the Or
pheum, where moving pictures show
ing the rival boxers in training were
thrown on the screen.
Corbett went on the road yesterday
and covered nearly sixteen miles. He
did no work In the afternoon.
The Sacramento greyhounds starred
at Union Coursing ParK yesterday.
When the deciding course was reached
bath contestants were products of the
capital city. George Nethercott's Barge,
that ever reliable fast one, carried off
the stake, the money, the glory and in
fact everything J that was possible for
a greyhound to win.
Silver Heels, however, was there
strongly and until the red flag was dis
played the spectators were in a quan
dary. The rival hounds raced after
the hare in such a wholehearted and
fearless manner that the spectators
kept up the cheering until the great
course was at an end.
Barge had the speed and that count
ed, for the wet, sodden ground was
bad for the hare. Silver Heels ruled a
favorite at odds of 1 to 2. She was slow
to settle down to work, but when once
started she ran gamely and had a
chance all the time.-
There were sixteen upsets in the first
round. Such fast ones as Sea Lion,
Red Rock, Haughty Helen and others
went down to defeat to the surprise of
the wise bettors. The hares were slow,
owing to the cold weather. A large
crowd was in attendance. Following

Michael Egan, the Jersey City'hand
ball expert, who is here to play Cham
pion Fitzgerald for the world's cham
pionship, took part in a four-handed
game at the Olympic Club yesterday,
and the big crowd present watched him
with deep Interest. Egan did . not ex
tend himself during the game, but at
times showed himself fast on his feet
and possessed of a qulckeye. He used
his left hand with as much skill as his
right and drove the ball with unerring
aim. The ball struck the front wall as
if shot from a rifle, and the Impact
echoed throughout the court. : Egan had
J. C. Nealon for a partner, and they
defeated Alderman James Dunne and
Al Hampton the best two out out of
three games. . â¢ â¢- â¢
The sale of seats for next -Sunday's
contest is large. Al Hampton has only
twenty seats left, and standing room
will be at a premium. Fitzgerald did
not play yesterday. He is in: perfect
condition. The members will pay $5 a
seat to see the champions perform next
Sunday and the following Sunday.
"When the championship Is decided the
pair will play exhibition games for the
members of the club and ., their fair
friends. ,
As a. preliminary to the big contest
next Sunday Henry Corey and Jimmy
White will play Midgy Magulre and
Joe Collins. The following Sunday
Henry Corey and Louis Levy, the
Oylmplc Club experts, will contest with
Joe Condon of the Occidental Handball
Club and Al Leach of the St. Ignatius
Athletic Club. Corey and Levy defeat
ed Condon and Mahoney last Wednes
day night.
A match game between Corey and
White and Levy and Maguire was
played yesterday, and the former won
by one point. It was a game of crip
ples. Corey's shoulder was out, Maguire
had a sore finger. White was suffering
from a bad "mit" and Levy's right
hand was badly bruised. In the final
game Levy and Maguire led and had
20 to their opponents' 10. White and
Corey took a brace and won out amid
great cheering.
J. C. Nealon, the veteran, and Alder
man Dunne, Phil Casey's side partner,
played a single-handed game, and when
the score stood 20 to 20 Scorer Jack
Gleason called it a draw. The two'men
played remarkably well and were heart
ily applauded. Following were the

The condition of the weather was en
tirely against good marksmanship yes
terday. The alternating dark and light
with heavy showers of rain kept the
riflemen busy adjusting their sights for
a center shot. The attendance of shoot
ers at. Schuetzen Park was far greater
than was expected under the condi
tions.
Joseph Straub, an old-time member
of the California Schuetzen Club was
the winner of the best bullseye with
257 points; he was closely followed by
Adam Brehm with 323.
In the Turners shooting section Otto
Burmeister was high man in the medal
shooting with 198 rings, followed by
Captain F. Attinger with 196.
In the bulseye contest of the Grutli
shooting section Charles Muller was
high man and won the Adam Brehm
medal. V\ ;i \ , *.-,' â¢ ~
Edward H. Benjamin, one of the vet
eran sharpshooters of the State, made
his appearance on the range and took
part in the proceedings of the Califor
nia Schuetzen Club. He demonstrated
by his good scores that he was still
a master of the rifle.
The opening rifle tournament of the
season will be held at Schuetzen Park
on the first Sunday in April. The pro
gramme is an attractive one and
marksmen are eagerly looking forward
to the event.
The special prize presented for bulls
eye shooting by Philo Jacoby was won
by H. Scheunert with 820 points.

The Oakland Hornets turned up yes
terday at the Presidio athletic grounds
for their penultimate match In the Cal
ifornia Association Football League
championship series with an incom
plete team. The match was forfeited to
the Thistles and a friendly game of two
half-hour periods was played, J. D.
Robertson acting as referee, with T.
Hunter and F. Lynch as linesmen.
The ground vaa in exceedingly poor
condition for play, the water standing
in deep pools in many places. It was
almost impossible for the players to
keep their footing, and fine play was
out of the question. Though the This
tles had several shots at goal neither
they nor their opponents scored. The
team3, neither of which was complete,
lined up in the following positions:

In the semi-final round for the Califor
nia Association football union cup the
Independents defeated the Occidentals
two goals to nothing. The match con
sisted of two periods of forty-five min
utes each. Arthur Robinson was ref
eree, with J. D. Robertson and H. R.
Gillchrest as linesmen. The match was
stopped for a few minutes on account
of heavy rain, but was resumed. Dur
ing the first period, which began at 3
o'clock, neither side was able to score,
though the Independents had several
shots at goal, A. E. Chivers doing
splendid work in saving. In the second
period T. Fay and Duncanson got one
each past the clever goalkeeper. The
Fay brothers, as usual, played a strong
game, In which they were well support
ed by Duncanson and Mechels. The In
dependents will play the final tie for
the cup next Sunday against the This
tles. In yesterday's match the teams
lined up in the following positions:

In spite .of the threatening weather
and the Icy wind a goodly number of
spectators watched the match to the
end.
In thÂ« open stake at Ingleside Cours
ins Park yesterday E. Reddy's courser
Full Moon showed he is possessed of an
abundance of Btamina as well as great
speed.
After beating: the fast Presidio Boy
in the second round it fell to his Uot
to go against Viking for three unde
cided trials before he could have his
colors raised. In the next round in a
course with Rector it looked easy for
the dog from the Eastern kennels. The
talent was so sanguine that their Judg
ment was right that 5 to 1 was auoted
on his chances. ]
Full Moon, to the surprise of all, just
ran away from his opponent and be&t
him by a score of 6â1. Later he went
out to Reckless Acrobat, the ultimate*
winner, after holding him well to the
hare.
Reckless Acrobat led everything he
met In the stake and was the best dosr
in the going. Homer Boy, the runner
up, also showed to good advantage.
Following are the day's results., with

Twelve years ago a pr6fessional gar

writer in the County Gentleman, found
a slight Irritation in -his fingers
after pitting up some Primula ob

moment at the time, so he thought no
more of It, especially as he felt no
further inconvenience all through the
summer of that year. The following
spring it recurred at the time the sap
rises In the trees and every year since
the same Inconvenience has asserted
Itself, despite the use of blood puri
fiers, dressings and all sorts of med

that it Is a form of . vegetable blood

Back in the seventies, when Dewey
had command of a ship of the old
Hartford type, he was lying in the
harbor off Genoa. Visitors were al
lowed on board at all times except
Sunday morning, at which time in
spection took place. One Sunday a
well known American millionaire
ateamed out with a party of friends
in hi3 private yacht and succeeded in
getting on . deck, where he was met
by Captain Dewey, who asked. him to
leave. Mr. Money remonstrated, and, 1
finally, exasperated by the cool firm
ness of the officer, he burst out: \
"No, sir, I won't leave. I am an
American citizen and have a perfect
right on this, vessel. I pay taxes in
America; I am on my own property;
part of this ship belongs^o me!"
Calmly Dewey opened his penknife,
stooped down, split off a piece of the
deck flooring. Handing it to the in
censed American citizen he replied:"
"That's about what you own, and
there's the ladder â -now grit!"
And he got â Lippincott's.

The state of things now prevalent
In the relations between the people
themselves of many parts of the Bal
kan Peninsula may be described
roughly as Christianized barbarism.
Murders are committed by one tribe or
family nominally Christian, against
another, and the murderers walk
unmolosted provided they can keep
clear of the victim's relatives, who
would wreck vengeance, not only on
the murderer's â¢ relatives, but even
against his fellow tribesmen or co
religionists. The truth is, as the Bul
letin d'Orient pomts out. that the Mirl
dites, the Malissoris and other sections
of people are still, in all essential
characteristics, barbarous and almost
semi-savage. â -London Globe.

Movements of Steamers.
It occurred to a writer in the
Rochester Post-Express to apply
President Harper's test qualification of
a good college professor to other oc
cupations.. He did so. with amazing
results. It will be remembered that
Mr. Harper said of a college professor:
First--He should be married.
Secondâ He should be a church mem
ber.
Thirdâ He should mix with the stu
dents outside the classrooms.
Fourth â He should have a doctor's
degree.
Fifthâ He should be willing to work
hard eleven months in the year.
Sixth â He should be in sympathy
with the public and take an active part
in public affairs.
This* ie a curious list of qualifications,
says the Post-Express, and every one
of them looks more like an incidental
than an essential thing. Let us see
how far they are "characteristic of a
college professor only. Take the case
of a brewer:
Firstâ He should be married.
Secondâ He should be a church mem
ber.
Third â He should mix with his work
men outside the brewery.
Fourthâ He should have a certificate
of apprenticeship in the art and mys
tery of brewing.
Fifthâ He should be willing to work
hard eleven months in the year.
Sixthâ He should, be in sympathy,
with the public and take an active part
in public affairs.
The formula seems to fit like a glove.
Try it on a circus manager:
First â Hft should be married.
Secondâ He should be a church mem
ber.
Thirdâ He should mix with the show
men outside the tent. ;
Fourthâ He should have a doctor's
degree.
Fifthâ He should be willing to work
hard eleven months In the year.
Sixthâ He should be in sympathy
with th<Â» public and take an active part
in public affairs.
President Harper's Test.
Henry Clay Evans is back in Wash
ington for the first time since he went
to London as Consul General of the"
United States. He says he finds Amer
ican ways decidedly more to his liking
than some of those on the other side,
and he is not getting rapidly used to
his new surroundings. There are
some tricks of speech that especially
annoy him. He fails to see why they
should speak of the "goods van run
ning off the metals," when they mean
that the freight car had run off the
track, and he hasn't got used yet to
London newspapers.
Evans has never had quite a fair
chance in the political game in Wash
ington. He was a candidate for Vice
President In the St. Louis convention
of 1S96, and he withdrew on a promise
that he should be given a place In Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet. When the time came
to cany out the promise it was inex
pedient to do so, and Evans was put at
the head of the Pension Office, where
he quickly made himself so obnoxious
to the pension attorneys and the pen
sion seekers that McKlnley had to
promise to let him go. It remained for
the present administration, hpwever,
to send him to London, where his Ag
gressive American habit of mind keeps
him In a state of pretty constant irri
tation with his surroundings.â New
York Globe.
; K\-ans on English Idioms.
Fellnlty finds its competent expres
sion in the genuine English tile cat.
There is, to my mind, nothing like the
same attraction in the petted Persians
uf the parlor beyond the fact that they
are cats of a kind. Not having to en
dure the rough-and-tumble life, they
lose their individuality and their char
acter, just as human beings do. They
love the cream pot more than the per
son who cares for them. The darlings
of the drawing-room, too, often are
greedy, conceited, irritable and selfish.
Has the cat a conscience? I am com
pelled to confess that I am rather
doubtful en that point. Let us leave it
on the basis that a cat is a true woman
and that fhe can dissemble passing
well. It is 'not her fault if she develops
a liking for the family canary and lor
the goldfish, nor if after eating a brace
of the latter she comes with an in
scrutable look of innocence on her face
and asks for milk. â Chicago Record -
Herald,
Another point in the complex charac
ter of the cat is her capacity for jeal
ouey. There is never Jealousy without
love, and this may be added to the
proofs of the cat's capacity for af
fection so strenuously denied by super
ficial observers. I have seen a cat de
liberately plan punishment for a dog
that was receiving more than she con
sidered his fair share of attention at
her mistress' hand?. She sprang on his
back, fixed her claws in his coat and
tame back with an air of reproach to
â¢\\aid her mistress after the dog had re
tired to a safe distance.
Cat's Jealousy and Revenge.
Details which are now transpiring as
to the avalanche which cost the lives of
six French soldiers bear another touch
ing tribute to the saving intelligence of
a dog. But for the sagacity of this
faithful animal the death roll must
have been doubly greater than it was.
After the rescue of the men entombed
the troops formed themselves into two
parties, one of which went forward in
the darkness at once with the Injured.
Luckily Captain Bartoli, who com
manded, had with him a small pocket
lamp. This gave light enough for the
leading rank to march by. The second
party had no such aid and were In a
desperate plight, when Captain Bartoli
had an inspiration. "Stop! Stop!" he
called,' and his dog crouched at his feet.
Attaching a string to the collar the
captain said, "Forward, Stop," and the
column marched behind the dog
through the dark. At dangerous points
the dog often had to turn back to find
the tracks of the first column, but It
always did find them, and at last led
the column to safety. â London GIbbe.

Five Cent Error Cost $17,000.
The greatness of little things finds
frequent illustration In railroad opera-
tion. A case has Just been discovered
where, nine years ago, an error of 5
cents was made In the computation of
a rate sheet between two given points.
It u-as found upon investigation that
as a result of this error the two rail-
roads operating between the two points
have lost cpward of $17,000 during that
time. This shows why railroads are
so strenuously opposed to what are
considered inconsequential reductions
in rates. The business in question was
simply the passenger traffic between
Dallas, Tex., and a small town located
a few miles, away. It is the multipli-
cation of the little things that so se-
riously affects railway revenues; The
loss of a fraction of a cent per hun-
dred pounds on some commodities
means thousands if not millions of dol-
lars to the railroads and makes the
difference between profit and loss. It
Is only by the most zealous care that
railroads are enabled to maintain their
revenues on a paying basis, and it is
for this reason that the value of little
things is so !well understood by rail-
way officials generally.-â Engineering

Iver Grunbach, a Swedish sailor, re
ported to the police last night that
he had been held up and robbed at
the corner of Washington and San

he was held up by three me.n, who
beat him cruelly on the head and then
rilled his pockets of ?6, allthat he
had. ;
Policeman J'. Attridge found Grun
bach lying on'the sidewalk at the cor
ner mentioned,"bleeding from several
ugly scalp wounds and cuts on'the
face. Grunbach told the patrolman
that he was on his way to his scow,
which lies at the seawall, when he
was struck from behind and felled to
the ground. Then, he says, three men
went thrQugh his pockets and relieved
him of his money.
Grunbach's face plainly showed the
effects of an encounter," it being cov
ered with contusions and cuts. The
policeman was unable to 'find any
trace of his assailants/Detectives

The second outcast was found on the
steps of the Third Congregational
Church, on Mission street, by Edmund
Clarence, the sexton, shortly, after 10
o'clock. The infant, a girl baby, prob
baly had been left there early in .the
night, for when found she was shiver
ing from the cold and all but famished.
The waif appears to be but a few days
old and is very frail and delicate. She
was wrapped in a , few fragments of
feminine wearing apparel of cheap tex
ture. She' was also given in charge of
the matron of the Central Emergency
Hospital.
Two more deserted waifs were found
in the Mission district yesterday morn
ing on doorsteps. Within the last week
no less than four discarded children
have been discovered in this section of
the city, and all within a radius of a
few blocks, and the finding of the un
fortunate babes has become the general
topic of the residents of the section.
The first waif to be discovered yes
terday was left on a doorstep at 1813
Mission street and' was found by
Charles McCarthy of 1831 Mission street
shortly before -2 o'clock yesterday
morning. The outcast was a boy, prob
ably about three weeks old and appar
ently healthy and happy. It was care
fully wrapped 1n a costly quilt and
placed in a telescope basket. From the
texture of the quilt it would appear
that whoever discarded the infant was
well to do. The child was taken to the
Central Emergency Hospital and given
in charge of the matron. It will be
turned over to some charitable institu
tion. ;

The Free Speech and Defense League
has been" organized but a few weeks,
yet at the present time it has 185 mem
bers on its roll and the list is rapidly in
creasing. It was founded chiefly for
the purpose of defeating the so-called
anti-free-speech ordinance, introduced
to restrict street corner oratory.
Benham advised every workingman
in San Francisco to Join the newly or
ganized league, for, he said, it waa to
their own interest and benefit to de
feat the proposed ordinance. He care
fully reviewed the bill, pointing out
many of Its alleged defects and showing
why he thought it unconstitutional.
Benham was followed by W. Leonard,
a prominent labor leader of Cripple
Crerek, Colorado. Leonard was given
an ovation when he appeared on the
stage and his address was an Interest
ing one. He told of the martial law in
Colorado and showed how the working
men there had been treated.
Benham told why the new league had
been organized. He bitterly attacked the
new ordinance and said it waa in direct
violatiqn of the constitution. He warn
ed the members of the league to be on
their guard and fight the new measure,
for*, he said, if they did not act with
alarcity, their foes were likely to steal
a march on them.
The Free Speech and Defense League
held its first public meeting last night
at the Alhambra Theater. Many prom
inent labor orators took the stand and
denounced' the proposed street speaking
ordinance now before the Board of Su
pervisors.
G. B. Benham, president of the Labor
Council, was the first talker of the
evening. His name was the signal for
a round of applause and he was fre
quently interupted during his talk by
cheers.

Connolly and Krueger, who hurried to
Sewelt's room. They placed Sewelt's
prisoner under arrest and booked him
at the City Prison on a charge of bur

Sewelt claimed that $1 35 had been

When Rogers was searched the comb
was found in his pocket and identified
by Sewelt as his property. A bunch

Then and not until then did the world
know that Moxey was possessed of con
siderable method. In the long legal
document filed by Mandeville he laid
bare the plot for a . fortune skillfully
laid and skillfully carried out by
Moxey and Hoover. He had learned
of the plot through a visit paid by
Hoover to Boston. The "professor,"
who had attended to all the details
connected with the transfer by Mra.
Moxey to her youthful husband of her
great holdings, for once overreached
himself. He hastened to Boston as
soon as the deeds had been completed,
assumed the name of Young, made
many inquiries about the value of tlw
realty, and then filed the deeds, thus
acquainting Mrs. Moxey's relatives
that she had for "love and affection
and $10," transferred to one Oliver N.
Moxey, her Boston property.
The case was on trial before Judge
Coffey for several weeks and ended
only when the Court, In an opinion that
branded Hoover and Moxey as a pair
of schemers, declared Mrs. Moxey In
competent and appointed Mandeville
the guardian of her property.
Mrs. Moxey, formerly Mrs. Gage H.
Phillips, aged 64, a Boston woman of
means, came out here two years ago.
She became inbued with the idea that
she should remain perpetually youthful
and when she was introduced to
Hoover and Moxey, it is claimed they
did the best they could to convince her
that perpetual youth could be obtained
and maintained by any one that took
a course of physical culture at "Hoo
ver's University" for the development
of muscle and grace. She matriculated
at the "university," and soon becams
the special charge of Oliver N. Moxey,
aged 27, instructor at the Hoover school.
It soon became known that the pupil
had means aplenty, and with this kowl
edge.came the revelation that the
sword-master had been smitten by tho
mature charms of his pupil and that
she, in learning to parry the sword
thrusts of her teacher, had exposed
herself to the deadly aim of cupid.
They finally went to San Jose, and were
married. Then came Mandeville's suit
against Mrs. Moxey, who is his mother
in-law. It was filed at a time, when
Moxey, with his pockets lined with the
gold of his bride, was living a life of
ease and comfort and filling his wife's
ears with honeyed words that only
made stronger the web he had woven
about her.
At the law offices of A. A. Moore,
Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Moxey was
examined by Drs. Wadsworth, Rethens,
McGettigan and Lustig as to her com
petency. These physicians are all
members of the Insanity Commission,
but did not make the examination in
their official capacity.
Mrs. Moxey will undergo a further
examination by the same physicians
this morning in Judge Hebbard'a
chambers, the purpose being to deter
mine her competency and if the same
is established, to restore her to capacity
that she may legally effect and agree
to a compromise division of her proper
ty that has been arranged between her
husband, the fencing instructor, Â¦ and
her guardian and stepson, Harry Man
deville.
A few minutes after the occurrence
several policemen were at the scene of
the attempted robbery and made a
search of the neighborhood, but failed
to find any one answering the descrip
tion of the thief. An investigation
failed to disclose the location of the
bullet fired at Knox. Back of the desk
is a gallery, on which is stored a large
supply of hams, bacon and soap. It is
probable that the bullet imbedded
Itself in these.
Detectives . Fitzgerald and Graham
are detailed on the case, but in view
of the inability of Knox to identify the
robber, it is not probable that the
search will be successful.
I made a move, all right, by dropping behind
the desk and, as I did eo, he discharged his
weapon. As soon as I dropped I commenced
to cry out 'Murder, thieves' and everything
else of an alarming nature I could think of.
Between the noise of the shot and my outcries
the robber evidently "became frightened and ran
out the front door. I followed him at a dis
tance of about 100 feet, until he reached Cum
berland street. He disappeared down the alley
land, a<Â« It waa dark and extremely mujjdy. I
thought it -was useless to pursue farther.
When I first saw the robber he was trying
to open the rlgister with his. right hand and
held bis revolver In his lafC hand. He wore a
white handkerchief bound over his face below
the eyes, concealing- his fpaturr* in such a
manner that it would be impossible for me to
Identify him positively. Ho was about five
feet ten Inches In height and wore a dark suit
of clothes and a derby hat. The register is
one of the latest patterns and requires that a
key be touched and a handle turned before the
drawer can be opened. He was evidently un
familiar with its workings, and to this Is due
the fact that he secured no money.
We were preparinc to close up. Robert
Knox. my eon. and Frank Walt and Henry
Burg, two clerks, were In the rear oi the shop,
cleaning uu, and I was sittlnc at the desk in
the front, maktng up some accounts. Opposite
the desk, on the other Â«i<Je of the shop, is the
cash mister. I heard an unusual noise and,
lookisg ud over the desk, discovered a^man
trying to open the reelster. He saw me as
quickly as 1 saw him and, pointing a revolver
at me with his left hand, he told me that if
I made a move he would blow my head off.
A lone robber made a desperate atr
tempt Saturday night at 9:30 o'clock
to hold up -the grocery of Robinson &
Knox at 876 Valencia street. Discov
ered in his attempt to rifle the cash
register, he fired one shot at Andrew B.
Knox, one of the proprietors, and then,
becoming frightened at the outcries of
those in the store, ran out of the front
door and made his escape. He ran up
Nineteenth street to a narrow alley
called Cumberland street and then dis
appeared down the dark thoroughfare.
Knox followed the robber as far as the
alley, but abandoned the pursuit there %
In telling of the incident Knox said:
Roattino and Stevens in a novelty
singing and dancing act are good, and
Montell Brothers, equilibrists, acrobats
and head-to-head balancers deserve
credit for their performance.
Emmett Corrigan and company ap
pear in "Jockey Jones," or "The Day of
the Handicap," and are as popular as
they were last week. The other hold
overs are the Nichols Sisters and Loney
Haskell. The moving pictures are par
ticularly interesting, showing the train
ing quarters of both Britt and Corbett,
also a scene at a life saving station.
Taffary's trained dogs are the best
that have been exhibited here in some
time. The little beasts appear almost
human and do tricks that seem almost
incredible.
La Belle Guerrero heads the bill at
the Orpheum this week. She appears
in a pantomimic sketch, "The Rose and
the Dagger," and the audience responds
with applause. She is ably assisted by
Philippe Daufaure and the, two carry
the piece to its finish. There is clever
dancing and the pantomime work is of
the best. The scenic effects are good
and the plot, though worked out in rno
tion, is complete.
Billy Clifford, known on the bills as
"The Broadway Chappie," makes a hit.
He sings good songs, has easy manners
on the- "boards" and retires with hon
ors.
"Erik of Sweden" is the offerinsr at
the California for this week, with Ben
llendricks, the Swedish dialect come
dian, in the title role. The play is a
good one of its kind, albeit Swedish
comedy has been overdone_jand under
done these twenty years past. Better
thap the play is Hendricks, who would
make a success in almost any kind of a
comedy role. He is genuinely funny,
and in addition possesses a splendid
barytone voice, which he used to. nood
eltect in a number of songs scattered
throughout the various acts. Notably
acceptable among these are "'Fair Land
of Sweden" and "Northland Lullaby."
The plot is somewhat more involved
than is usual in Swedish dialect plays.
The hero is a Swedish baron who comes
to <his country to gain a livelihood.
He discards his title and hires as over
seer to a wealthy man who had de
spoiled and disgraced Erik's father in
the old country. The overseer falls in
love with his employer's daughter and
his suit is favored by her fathei\ who
hopes thus to repair the wrontc he has
done. The villain, Count Ardale. Indif
ferently played by Charles Rowan, also
lays siege to the heart of the heiress,
and after four acts of narrow escapes
and blood curdling attempts on Erik's
life is finally thwarted and croes out
the right upper entrance with a mock
ing laugh. Then the heiress. Anna Al
lonstrom by name, and creditably ren
dered by Miss Helen Nelson, succumbs
to Erik's pleadings and the play is over.
Little Evelyn .Wright, precocious and
interesting, delightfully portrays Little
Elinore, and, together with George Mil
ler as Jim, a New York street waif,
lends a strong element of comedy to the
performance. Miss Belle Francis as
Henrietta Mowbry. sister to the villain
and something of a plotter herself,
made everything possible out of her
role, which was considerable. Miss Jo
sephine Florence - Shepard as Mrs.
Christina Gulden played the kittenish
widow* on somewhat broad lines, but
managed the part very well. The play
will run for the remainder of the week.
