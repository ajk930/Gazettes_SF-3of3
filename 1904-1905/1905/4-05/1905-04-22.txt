FRANCE TO MAINTAIN STRICT NEUTRALITY
France desires to maintain neutrality in the Russian-Japanese trouble and has taken steps to escape being
drawn into the complications in the Far East. The Russian cruiser Diana, which took refuge at Saigon
last August, has been ordered disarmed by the French Government. It is reported that Vice Admiral
Rojestvensky has sailed with his fleet from Kamranh Bay for Vladivostok. â¢

ST. PETERSBURG, April 22, 2:40
a. in. â Report* are current here that
the Russian second Pacific squadron
has already left Kamranh Bay and is
on the way to Vladivostok, bat the
Government will proceed with action
on the Japanese protest as If the
squadron had not continued Its voy
age.
A special service was held in the

PARIS, April â The announcement
cf M. asses intention to resign as
Foreign Minister was but one of many
incidents in a day of much anxiety
throughout the Government quarters.
Following close upon the heels of the
Â«m;pfJr**lOT3i with Germany ..over
Morocco, the Franco-Japanese indict
ment suddenly assumed serious propor
tions and unusual energy was shown in
preventing its embroiling France in
complications in the Far East. In or
der to secure definite co-operation be
tween three departments of the Gov
ernment, namely, naval, colonial and
foreign, a conference was held this aft
ernoon between leading representatives
cf each department. This brought
about a clear understanding regarding
the measures necessary for the main
tenance of neutrality of Indo-Chinese
â¢waters, and orders were sent to Gov
ernor General Beau to specifically re
port the exact location of the Russian
Pacific squadron and whether it had
or had not withdrawn from French
waters.
Communications with St. Petersburg
led to orders being transmitted by the
Russian Government to Vice Admiral
Rojestvensky to vigorously respect the
neutrality of French waters. It was
even stated that Foreign Minister
Lamsdorff would carry the question
before Emperor Nicholas in order to
assure complete respect.
Probably the most significant devel
opment from the energetic measures
edepted was the receipt of a dispatch
trcra Saigon saying that imperative or
ders cad been given for the disarma
ment of the Russian cruiser Diana,
which sought refuge in the harbor of
Eelgon eight months ago for the pur
pose of repairs. The main portion of
the Diana's machinery must now be
handed over to the French naval au
thorities at Saigon.
The anticipated debate in the Cham
ber of Deputies of the Question of neu
trality was postponed owing to the
Dfe!c&Â£se announcement. The only ref
erence to the subject was the inquiry
by Deputy Deloncle pad the brief reply
from Premier Rouvier, who said:
"Formal, precise and repeated orders
have been given cur agents In Indo-
Cfaina to assure the absolute neutrality
of France in Indo-Chinese waters."
It was stated at the Foreign Office
late this afternoon that no represen
tations cf any kind had been presented
by Great Britain concerning neutrality.
At the same time it is anticipated that
some such representations will be
made. The fact that the British Em
bassador, Sir Francis Bertie, ha* given
up his Easter holiday and will return
to Paris to-night after a conference
with Foreign Secretary Lansdowne.
appears to support this view. How
ever, the cordial relations existing be
tween Franc* and Great Britain would
doubtless modify any representations
co as to relieve them from serious sig
nificance. Anything like an energetic
protest from Great Britain at this
time would deeply wound France, who
relies on the Anglo-French entente as
a counterpoise to Germany's menaces
over Morocco.

ANNOUNCES
HIS DESIRE
TO RESIGN
MinisterDelcasse May
Quit the French
Cabinet.
Colleagues Request Him to
Reconsider His De
termination.
Declare That Interests of Country at
This Time Require That He
Retain His Portfolio.
PARIS. April 21.â After a notable ser
vice of nearly eight years in the divis
ion of foreign affairs. Theophile Del
casse to-day informed President of the
Council Rouvier of his desire and in
tention to resign. This announcement
came as a surprise and shock to M.
Delcasse s colleagues of the Cabinet,
who Immediately took steps to en
deavor to secure a reconsideration of
his determination. A Cabinet council
was held this evening at which M.
Rouvier, in the absence of M. Del
casse, laid the situation before the
' Ministers. It was the unanimous de
termination of the council that the
interests of the country at this time
required that M. Delcasse retain the
; portfolio of foreign affairs. Accord
ingly, at the conclusion of the council,
,M. Rouvier proceeded to the Quai
d'Orsay. where he held an extended
' conference with the Minister of For
eign Affairs. The president of the
; council, voicing the wishes of Presi
! dent Loubet and the Ministers, earn
estly besought M. Delcasse to retain
It is evident that M. Rouvier's earn
est appeal caused M. Delcasse to
waver in his determination. When the
President of the Council came from the
interview h# stated to his colleagues
that he bore a favorable impression
of its results. M. Delcasse, he said,
had given no final answer, but had
promised to reserve his determination
until to-morrow, when a final answer
will be given.
It is believed that M. Delcasse will
yield to the insistence of President
Loubet and the President of the Coun
cil.
The motives leading up to M. Del
casse's sudden determination to retire
from the Cabinet are primarily attrib
uted to internal controversies over the
Moroccas question; and this to some
extent rra.s been accentuated by simi
lar controversies over French neutral
ity In the Far East. The opposition
has been quick to seize upon both
questions, and. headed by Socialists
and Nationalists, have directed their
criticisms against M. Delcasse. The
Socialist criticisms have been particu
larly vehement during recent days on
the Moroccan question and this ap
pears to have already decided M. Del
casse to surrender the question into
other hands. It is felt that his retire
ment now would be hailed in Germany
as a German triumph, and this is one
of the main considerations leading: M.
Rouvier to earnestly appeal to M. Del
casse to remain in the foreign office.
casse to remain in the foreign office.
The news of M. Delcasses inten
tions made a profound impression in
the Chamber of Deputies, where it wag
first received with incredulity. Later,
however, when M. Deloncle. (R.) ques
tioned the government on the neutral
ity question and M. Rouvier replied in
stead of M. Delcasse. it was realized
that the report had solid foundation.
Several Deputies stated that M. Del
casse had sent a letter of resignation
to the President of the Council and
that M. Rouvier had declined to ac
cept it, saying he would be obliged to
present it to the council of ministers.
It was as a result of this presentation
to the council that M. Rouvier per
suaded M. Delcasse to withhold his
final decision until to-morrow.
OPINION OF PTPIX)MATS.
Bolleve That Moroccan Affair* Are
Cause of Threatened Retirement.
WASHINGTON. April 21. â Diplo
mats in close touch with European
Chancellories hold the opinion that
Morocco more than the menace to
French neutrality in the Far East is
responsible for the threatened retire
ment of M. Delcasse, the French Min
of Foreign Affairs. It is learned
that France has informed Germany
that nothing could have been further
from her intentions than to injure
German interests in Morocco and even
has gone so far as to say that the
French position there not only fur
nishes a protection to the commerce
of other nations, but insures rather
than threatens the integrity of Mo
rocco, and thereby the maintenance
of the status quo. which was the espe
cial cause of concern to the Berlin
Government. So satisfied is Germany,
It is paid, with the attitude of France,
and fo different is that attitude from

MAN KILLED
IN HOLD-UP
OF SALOON
T. Reilly Falls Dead
in Fusillade ol
Bullets.
Masked Man Opens Fire on
Bartender Who Shoots
From Coyer.
Jtevedore Laid Low During the Duel
and Police Are Puzzled Over
the Strange Case.
A hold-up man whose face was con
cealed behind a black mask stealthily
entered the saloon of John C. Brutt at
1 Second and Brannan streets shortly
before midnight last night. When the
bartender refused to throw up his
hands the robber opened fire and in the
pistol duel that followed, Thomas
Reilly, a customer of the place, fell
dead, his heart pierced by a bullet.
Whether Brutt or the intruder fired the
fatal shot remains to . be proved. The
burglar made his escape try a side
door.
Reilly and Brutt were the sole oc
cupants of the place when the man en
tered by the side door. In deliberate
i tones he commanded Brutt 'to hold
jup his hands and no fooling. ' Instead,
I the bartender reached for his revolver
behind the bar. When the robber saw
this he opened fire. Brutt raised his
head above the bar and returned the
I fusillade. In all live shots were ex
changed and Reilly fell dead during the
volley.
The position of Reilly s body would
indioate that he was shut by Brutt. He
wae found face downward on the floor
near a small door that leads from the
grocery store to the bar. The door is
pierced by a bullet hole and' the mis
sile entered from the barroom side.
The big mirror behind the bar is
shattered by two bullets, both of 32
caliber, which were fired by the hold
up man. Brutt used a 38-ealiber re
volver, so when the autopsy is held
on the remains of Reiliy it will be
ascertained whether he was killed by
thi** bartender or the robber.
That two men were mixed up in the
job is a likely theory, though Brutt
says he saw but one. H. Verney, who
resides in the neighborhood, says he
saw but one man run out the front
door of the place and down Second
street, while Brutt positively asserts
that the man who tried to hold up the
place ran out of the side door. He
was not seen after making his â ape
from the saloon.
Police Officer J. S. Cook was the
first to arrive on the scene after the
shooting. He heard the shots from
where he was standing a block away
and ran quickly to the scene. He saw
nobody hastening from the place. He
thinks the man or men probably
turned into one of the numerous side
streets in the vicinity and made haste
toward the water front.
Cook picked up the robber's hat in
the barroom. It is black, well worn
and dusty. Brutt says the robber had
it turned down over his face, so as
to hold the black mask in place. The
saloon man describes the robber as be
ing a man of medium build, about 5
feet 6 Inches in height and wearing
dark clothes. He talked in a steady
voice and seemed cool and collected-
Brutt tella the following story of the
hold-up: "I was standing behind the
bar talking with Reilly, when a man
wearing a black mask and displaying
a revolver entered the side door of the
saloon. He said, "Hold up your hands
and no fooling!' I reached behind the
bar to get my pistol and he fired. I
ducked down and returned* the fire as
quick as I could
"I fired two shots and the robber fired
three. Reilly was standing at the end
of the bar but I was so excited I did
not see him drop till it was all over.
The robber ran out the side door. I
found Reilly lying face downward. He
was dead. Policeman Cook came in
shortly after and found the robber's
hat."
The saloon-keeper was very much ex
cited over the affair and was not able
to give a clear account of what hap
pened. He does not know whether
Reilly tried to escape or not. He does
not know whether the robber aimed at
Reilly, but if he did he could not have
been shooting at Brutt, for the bar
tender was directly in front of him,
while Reilly was standing at his left
hand side and he w^ould have to turn
directly around to have killed the lat
ter.
Detectives Ryan and McManus came
on the scene to make an Investigation.
They are not convinced as to who fired
the fatal shot, as there were no wit
nesses to the affair save Brutt, and he
was too wrought up to give a clear
version of the fatality. He will prob
ably be held pending an investigation.
RÂ«illy was a native of Brooklyn, New
York, and 47 years old. He was a
stevedore by occupation and resided
HARRY E. WISE MUST FACE
CHARGE OF GRAND LARCENY
\ccused of Taking a
Dress Without Pay
ing Bill.
H. Kramer Avers the
Clubman Issued
Bogus Draft.
A warrant is out for the
arrest Of Harry E. Wise, son
of former Collector of the
Port John H. Wise, on a
charge of grand larceny.
The complaining witness is
H. Kramer, a ladies* tailor,
who alleges he delivered a
dress to Wise for his wile
last February and that the
latter gave a worthless
draft in payment. Kramer
says Wise promised to pay
the bill, amounting to
$?7 50. but failed to make
good his promise.
rfarry E. Wise, prominent young
business man, former club swell and
bon vivant, is wanted by the police
on a charge of grand larceny. A war
rant was issued for his arrest yester
day afternoon by Police Judge Fritz
on complaint of H. Kramer, ladies'
tailor, 20 Sansome street, who accuses
Wise of giving him a worthless draft
for $77 50 in payment for a lady's
! dress.
Kramer says Wise came to him last
February a"d asked for credit on a
lady's dress. Kramer told Wise he did
not give credit, but agreed to make the
dress for Mrs. Wise and deliver it C.
O. D. According to Kramer, the dress
â¢ was delivered on February 20 and the
i messenger who took the parcel was
I handed a draft by Wise on the old
I firm of Christy & Wise for the sum
When the messenger arrived with the
draft, Kramer discovered it was worth
less. He was quick to notify Wise
of the fact and s, ys the latter agreed
to pay the bill at once. According to
Kramer, Wise has been agreeing to
settle ever since, but when the tailor
tried to collect the money he was in
variably turned down.
Kramer complained to the police
several days ago and the bond and
warrant clerk wrote to Wise and asked
him to settle the account in order to
avoid trouble. Wise promised to make
good the amount without delay, but
again his promise counted for naught,
and the warrant for his arrest is the
result.
That Wise has been in financial
straits for some time seems to be the
general opinion of ail who know him.
He told several of his friends that he
was in all kinds of trouble and had a
hard time in settling his accounts, so
that is probably the reason he kept
Kramer waiting.
Kramer waiting.
Wise is the son of John H. Wise, for
merly Collector of Customs of this
port and prominent Democratic poli
tician in the old days. Ytrung Wise
cut a wide swath in club and busi
ness circles a few years ago and was
known as one of the best dressers in
town. Since that time he has lost a
great deal of money and consequently
the clubs and resorts have not seen
as much of him as they formerly did.
Wise is believed to have lost heav
ily in the stock markets within the
last few years. He budded out as a
political power on the strength of his
father's reputation some lime ago, but
did not last long as a shining light.
He was married only a short time ago.
He could not be found last night. The
warrant will probably be served on
him to-day unless the case is settled
out of court.

DIPLOMATS ARE AI.ERT.
Believe Japan Is Contemplating: An
other Bold Stroke.
WASHINGTON, April 21. â Little
significance is attached here to the
Cling with Secretary Taft of Japan's
protest to France by Mr. Hiokl, who
Is in charge of the Japanese legation
in Minister Takahira's absence. Sec
retary Taft acccepted it as a formal
notification to this Government of the
Japanese attitude in regard to France
without answer or comment and for
warded the note to President Roose
velt, together with other official pa
pers. It is regarded by officials that
the purpose of Japan in notifying this
Government that she had protested to
France against giving an asylum to
the Russian fleet in Kamranh Bay
was to place on record with other
Governments her claim that this is in
violation of neutrality and "In order
that it may not be charged that she
has lost any rights by any neglect to
assert . them 'with proper notification
to the other powers. In on way, it is
said at the State Department, can the
filing of the note involve this Govern
ment in any controversy between
France and Japan.
Far greater importance is attached
to the matter by members of the dip
lomatic corps. They remember Japan's
sudden way of beginning the war with
out the usual informal notice . and
thai, too, after she had assured the
other nations j that hostilities would
rot be begun until after a declaration
of war. For that reason they are pre
pared to hear at any time that Togo
has sailed to Kamranh Bay and en
gaged the Russian fleet or done some
thing equally as bold v
Members of the corps are not pre
pared to accept the reports of the
junction between the main body of
the Russian fleet and the third squad
ron. Reports to the State Depart
ment indicate that Nebegotoff Is near
Singapore and is following the route
taken by Rojestvensky. Making pro
test to France at this time would, it is
calculated, tend to divert attention from
the progress of the third squadron and
lead to the belief that Japan was in
tent upon disposing of the question of
the violation of neutrality before do
ing anything else.

at Kamranli I iky.
TOKIO, April 21. â Government
continues silent in regard to the Kam
ranh Bay incident. It is understood,
however, that the diplomatic corre
spondence on the subject is not con
cluded, and it is expected that France
will make a formal investigation of the
situation at the port of Kamranh. In
the meantime political leaders are
I counseling the Japanese press to use
greater moderation and to calmly await
the outcome of present negotiations.
- Count Katsura, Premier of Japan,
and Baron Komura, Minister of
Finance, were received in audience by
the Kmperor to-day.
It is popularly believed here that the
Rupsian fleet is still at. Kamranh Bay
and is making the freest possible use of
the pert. The demands for strong ac
tion on the part of Japan are daily
growing louder. Political parties and
other organizations are passing res
olutions condemning France's alleged
violation of neutrality. It is proposed
to hold a^great popular demonstration.

the evidence is conclusive that Admiral
Rojestvensky is using Kamranh Bay
as an actual naval base for belligerent
I The Jij; Frances historical
The Jiji discusses France's historical
attitude on the question of neutrality
and insists that the use of Kamranh
Bay enhances Admiral Rojestvensky's
lighting capacity and offers facilities
lor warlike preparations. Continuing
it says if from the complication grave
consequences result to Russia France
will be responsible.
A former Cabinet Minister discussing
the incident to-day said:
''We are keenly anxious to avoid in
volving others, but we are bound to
protect our rights. If France gives
Russia the use of Kamranh Bay why
cannot England allow us to use Hong

Displays Xo Anxiety Over Alleged
Violation of Neutrality.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 22.â N0 re-"
ply is expected from Vice Admiral
Rojesti-cnsky for several days relative
to the instructions to him to respect
the neutrality of French .waters. Ad- f
mira! Wirentus stated last night that
Hojestvensky^s -telegram announcing
his arrival at Kamranh Bay took four
â¢ days in transmission.
Admiral Wircnius added that he had
no idea of the present whereabouts . of
Roj?stv*nsky, but that he believed that
he had deft Kamranh Bay. In any
case, he said, at this season territorial
waters offer no greater advantages,
because the weather Is good. and the
sea calm.
The Foreign Office displays no anx
iety as a result of the protests made
by Japan over the alleged violation of
French neutrality, expressing conli
' dence that when all the facts are
known it will be found that the Rus
sians did not violate the neutrality of
France. Serious complications are not
anticipated.

AWAITS FRANCE'S REPLY.
No Official Statement From Britain
on the Neutrality Question.
LONDON. April 21.â A1l the Govern
ment offices were closed to-day and
most of the officials were out of town,
making it almost impossible to secure
an official statement regarding Great
Eritain's contemplated or actual action
in connection with the neutrality
question in the Indo-Chinese waters.
The question was discussed yesterday
between Baron Hayashi, the Japanese
Minister, and Foreign Secretary Lans
downe. The Baron said this afternoon
that he was not prepared to discuss
the question whether or not Great Bri
tain would send a note to France on
the subject.
"It is a pending matter," he said. "I
am not prepared to make a statement
which might embarrass both my own
Government and the Government of
Great Britain.'"
It would appear, however, that it is
not improbable that Great Britain is
awaiting France's reply to the Jap
anese protest before taking definite ac
tion. Sir Francis Bertie, the British
Embassador to France, left London
to-da.y for Paris and it is considered
\W4P\- that he is the bearer of special
instructions from Foreign Secretary
L-ansdowne directing him to take ac
tion under "certain eventualities.

WARSAW POST
WARSAW, April 21.â A dispatch
from St. Petersburg says that General
Maximovitch has resigned the Gover
nor Generalship of Warsaw owing to
differences with the Committee of Min
isters regarding Polish concessions.
The report appears to be well founded
and if true it will seriously affect the
situation in Warsaw.
A drunken soldier at 8 o'clock to
night fired his revolver in the crowded
streets of this city, killing one and
wounding six persons, c-ne of them
probably fatally. A patrol had at
tempted to arrest the man, but failed
and as the culprit fled he fired in all
directions. Among the wounded are
two soldiers, a policeman and two
Jews, a father and son. A workman
finally captured the miscreant.

who fired five shots at him, all taking
effect. The assailants escaped.

15 of the imperial family, including the
Emperor Empress, the Czarevitch, the
Grand Dukes and the Dowager Em
press as- lying dead in their coffins, has
been reproduced on cards bearing on
the reverse side the Russian national
anthem. These carda are being scat
tered by thousands throughout St. Pe
tersburg and in other parts of Russia.
The cards were printed abroad. The
police apparently are puzzled as to the
line of action to pursue.
DEATH CALLS
CONNECTICUT'S
SENIOR SENATOR
WASHINGTON, Conn., April 21.â
Vnited States Senator Orville Hitch
cock Platt of Connecticut died at his
summer home in Washington, his na
tive town, at 8:53 to-night. The end
came almost unexpectedly, the im
mediate cause being the breaking of
an abscess which had formed in the
right lung and which produced strang
ulation. In the room at the time were
Mrs. Platt and the Senator's only son,
Juage James P. Platt oÂ£ the United
States Circuit Court.
The funeral will probably be held
next Tuesday, with services in the
Congregational church. Both houses of
Congress will be represented.
Senator Platt contracted a severe
cold while the Swayne impeachment
trial at the national capital was in
progress before the Senate. He had
not fully recovered from it at the time
of Senator Hawleys funeral. He stood
in the railway station at Hartford for
some time awaiting the arrival of the
train on which General Hawley's body
was brought from Washington. During
the wait he complained of a slight chill,
in consequence of which, after the ex
ercises at the Capitol he returned di
rect to his country home in Washing
ton.
On Friday, March 31, the Senator
was taken with the illness which
proved fatal. The first attack was of
bronchitis-pneumonia of v a compara
tively slight nature. This fcvas folfevved
on April 4 by a second infection which
lasted for about a week. On April 11
he showed signs of improvement, so
that hopes of his recovery were enter
tained, but soon after an abscess de
veloped and on April 18 he had a bad
chill. The following day his physi
cians and nurses feared it would be thÂ«
end, but he rallied from that attack.
Other chills, however, followed at in
tervals, culminating in a particularly
severe onp this forenoon between 9 and
11 o'clock. Although the sick man
seemed to rally somewhat from this at
tack and became comfortable during
the afternoon, it was evident that his
life was ebbing away. His physician at
8:46 o'clock stated that the end would
come with another chill and that the
thread life would snap suddenly.
This iwJved to be the case and a few
minutes later Senator Platt's life was
ended.

REFUSES TO BETRA V RE VOL UTICKYJRIES
yot'ng polish girl arrested during the riots in warsaw and /
beatp:n to death for refusing to betray the leaders in the
movement against the officers of the czar.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WARSAW, April 2J.â Russian offi
cialdom's latest victim is a girl of
seventeen, Angele Zochowski, who h^s
just died as the result of barba'roua
treatment meted out to her in a War
saw prison.
It will be recalled that during the
recent riots in Warsaw many of the
school children struck the only means
they had of showing how passionately
they s slded with their parents in their
struggles against the oppressor. With
this juvenile protest, Angele Zochow
ski, who was a pupil of the Second
Gymnasium, as it is called, was asso- j
ciated. She was promptly arrested and
placed in solitary confinement, after
which the police officials set to work
to terrify her into telling who were
the ringleaders of the "strike."
As Angele steadfastly refused, they I
kept her short of food and water, and
when, after a course of this treat
ment, she still held out. she was beaten
several times a day. Her health gave
way under this brutal handling and
now she is dead, but she breathed her
last without telling her murderers
what they wanted to know.
Warsaw, already on the point of re
volt against Russian rule, has been in
flamed almost to madness by the fate
of this unfortunate child. To add to
the horror of the story, nineteen other
girls of the same school are still in
prison and liable to similar treatment.

BEEF INQUIRY
CHTCAGO, April 21.â The Federal
Grand Jury, which is investigating the
business affairs of the meat packers, re
sumed to-day its inquiry into the de
tails of the sausage casing business as
carried on by the packers. Over a
score of clerks and other employes of
the packers told the Grand Jury what
they knew of this branch of the pack
ing industry.
Chief Jehn E. Wilkie of the United
States Secret Service Bureau, who is
in Chicago, en route to the Philippines,
said to-day that he had learned that
certain packers and their attorneys had
questioned the right of the United
States Secret Service Department to
make an investigation in conjunction
with the Federal Grand Jury. The
packers. Chief Wilkie said, contended
that the Secret Service Department is
under the charge of the United States
Treasury Department and that the
funds provided by Congress cannot be
used in a special investigation because
the secret service is really only fo-r the
suppression of counterfeiting.
In reply to this contention Chief Wil
kie said that the special detail of men
connected with the investigation of the
packing industry is being paid out of
the $500,000 appropriation made by Con
gress for the purpose of pushing the
investigation and that the secret serv
ice men would be kept on the case as
long as they were needed.

M. WITTE MAY
SOON RETIRE
ST. PETERSBURG, April 21.â The
personnel of the Goremykin Commis
sion, appointed to discuss questions re
lating to peasant tenure of lands, was
announced to-day. It includes M.
Stichlnsky, formerly chief adjutant of
| the Russian Interior Department; M.
j yon Plehwe, son of the late Interior
Minister, and other adherents of the
former Minister, giving it a decided re
actionary tone.
The position of M. Witte, president
of the Committee of Ministers, grows
more and more untenable. Interior
Minister Bouligan has proposed to the
council of the empire that the question
of higher education confided to the
Committee of Ministers be transferred
to a special commission. The Slovo
again publishes a report that M. Wltte
will retire immediately, intimating that
his successor will be Count Solsky,
president of the economic department
of the Committee of Ministers.
An interesting re#ort is current that
M. Shipoff, president of the Moscow
Zemstvo, will succeed M. Bouligan.
Should this be true it might indicate
that the Government is disposed to ac
cept the programme proposed by the
National Progressive party at Moscow,
of which Shipoff is the head.
Additional Cossacks are being
brought to St. Petersburg in view of

Two squadrons of Cossacks of the Don

The students who were tried for en

As the time they have already spent in

days longer to serve.

under the name of "Mrs. Howard E.

The identity ot the woman at the
Palace has been established as that of
Mrs. E. E. Crandall. divorced wife <>f
one of Los Angeles' wealthy mer

movements, have convinced many that
her mind is unbalanced. She is many

he can find no reason why she should

JOSEPH JORDAN
ON THE STAND
SACRAMEXTO, April 21â The new
feature of Joseph S. Jordan's testimony
in the trial of Harry Bunkers, charged
with bribery, to-day had to do with the
:â ! of legal advice by Jordan from
Attor.iey H. W. Johnson of San Fran
cisco prior to testifying before the
S< nate Committee.
In answer to a question as to how
he came to be a witness before the
Sf-nate investigating committee, Jordan
said he had been offered no immunity
stifying. He said he had been
subpenaed and that Attorney Hiram
W. Johnson told him that if he took
the stand that would be a bar to all
criminal prosecution, so far as he was
concerned.
r^-direct examination the witness
said that his attorney had read to him
the section of the law providing that
should he testify, prosecution for any
thing but perjury in his case would be
barred. The impelling reason, how
ever, was !>ecause Tirey L. Ford, at
torney for the United Railways in San
Francisco, had advised him as a friend,
not as a lawyer, to go on the stand and
tell the whole truth.
An objection that what was said at
the conference by others than Bunkers
could have no bearing as a confession
and could not be admitted was over
ruled. The witness said he did not
â¢like to divulge what was said by oth
ers at the conference without first
consulting Attorney Johnson. Judge
Hart said the District Attorney could
irsÂ»ist upon a reply if he desired to do
P". District Attorney Peymour said he
did not feel like compelling the wit
ii<-Fs to proceed without consulting his
attorney, and in the end Jordan was
fxcused from further testimony until
such time as he might have conferred
with Lawyer Johnson in San Fran
cisco.
An absent witness caused adjourn
ment, by agreement, until Monday
morning.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. APRIL 22. 1905
EQUITABLE MUSS PLACED
BEFORE THE GOVERNOR
Appeal Made to Authorities of
State of New York.
SOCIETY FACES MORE LITIGATION
ALBANY. X. V., April 21.â The af
fairs of the Equitable Life Assurance
Society were laid before Governor
Higgins at the executive chambers this
afternoon by the committee of thirty
five of the managing agents of the so
ciety, which earlier in the day at
Syracuse had made an appeal for the
mutualization of the society to Super
intendent Hendricks of the State In
surance Department. The views of
the agents were presented to the Gov
ernor by John Bowes, manager for the
Equitable at Baltimore, as chief
spokesman. The agents also presented
to the Governor the resolutions adopt
ed earlier in the week at the agents'
convention in New York City.
Governor Higgins made very evi
dent his appreciation of the great seri
ousness of the situation in the Equit
able Society. His reply to the agents
was greeted with applause. He said
that the Governor and Legislature had
not the power to settle the Equitable
difficulty; that the matter was in the
courts, properly, he thought. He con
tinued:
"'I do not feel at the present moment
that I can assure you as to whether
the time will come in the immediate
future when it will seem to me wise to
communicate with the Legislature and
ask it to pass any particular bill in
reference to the Equitable Life; but
I can say to you this, with the utmost
frankness and sincerity, that at all
times I shall be interested more in the
interests of the policy-holders of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society than
in the interests of any other person or
party connected with it. And if I
come to the conclusion that I can fur
ther the interests of those policy
holders, if I should come to that con
clusion, you can rest assured that no
act will be left undone by me that will
bring about better conditions for that
society."
APPEAL. TO HEXDRICRS.
Insurance Superintendent in Favor of
Mutaalization Plan.
SYRACUSE. N. V., April 21.âPrefer
ably mutualization, the turning over
of substantial interests to the policy
holders, or some other remedy to re
lieve the embarrassing situation in
the affairs of the Equitable Life As
surance Society, was the burden of the
request made of Superintendent of In
surance Francis Hendricks by the
committee of general agents who laid
their wishes before him here to-day.
About forty members of the special
committee of seventy-two, appointed
at the meeting of general agents re
cently held in New York, were pres
ent at the conference held at noon in
Superintendent Hendricks' dfficer at the
State Bank of Syracuse, of which he is
president. Among the prominent
agents present were: Wyman Ellis,
Helena. Mont.; W. S. Bowen. Albu
querque. N. M.; J. H. Allenberg,
Spokane. Mr. Hendricks said:
"As far as the mutualization of the
company is concerned, I have already
expressed myself very clearly. I am
very much in favor of that outcome.
I am not sure, however, that you can
obtain the relief by legislation. Of
course I speak to you as Superintend
ent of Insurance. You know I have no
control over the Legislature and can
not say what that body will do. The
question has got to be determined by
the courts. If Judge Maddox decides
that I have no power to put in force
the amended charter, an appeal will
be made either to the Court of Ap
peals cr the United States courts.
"I will tell you frankly that I do not
believe the Lord suit was instituted by
Hyde interests. Mr. Lord is only anx
ious that I shall not approve the
amended charter for the reason that he
believes that the value of his own
stock would be endangered by such
approval.
"The first proposition, you know, I
refused to accept. The second one,
which is now in the hands of the At
torney-General, I am disposed to ac
cept. It provides that the policy hold
ers elect 28 of the fifty-two directors
and I believe that under it, it will be
only a question of time when the pol
icy holders will be in full control.
"I will assure you, though, that
whether legislation is feasible or not,
I'm heartily in favor of mutualization.
Before we get through the Insurance
department will disclose absolutely if
there are dummy directors. You can
rely on this. When we get done, we
will tell y#u the true condition of that
society. I can't say how long it will
take, whether days, weeks or months,
but it will be thoroughly done.
â¢Meantime the Frlck committee has
asked questions of the officers which
will take them thirty or forty days to
answer."
After the conference the agents gen
erally expressed satisfaction at the re
ception by Hendricks and with his
statement.
ASK FOR RECEIVER.
Grave Charges Made by Policj -Hold-
ers in Chicago.
CHICAGO, April 21.â A bill for the
appointment of a receiver for the
Equitable Life Assurance Society and
for an accounting was filed in the
United States Circuit Court here to
day by Attorney D. J. Schuyler.
The petition is filed in the name
of Abraham Sitron and others,
policy-holders of the society. Sitron
says he holds a $2000 policy in the so
ciety and that his interests are being
disregarded by the officers and direc
tors of the society. He names specifi
cally President J. W. Alexander and
Vice President James H. Hyde.
In the bill Alexander and Hyde are
charged with misappropriation of funds
and mismanagement. The bill also de
clares that for ten years the charter of
the company and the laws of New York
have been violated inasmuch as the
officials have failed to distribute the
profits of the company among the pol
icy-holders. The complaining policy
holders are seven In number, each
holding a policy of from $1000 to $3150.
HYDE ISSUES STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, April 21.â James H.
Hyde to-night issued a statement in
reply to that of the committee of
agents which waited on him yester
day In this statement he says in part:

TRADE REPORTS
ARE IRREGULAR
Weather Conditions '--Are Not
Favorable \ and in Con
sequence Prices Fall Off
NEW YORK. April 21. â Brad
street's to-morrov will say: Trade
reports are irregular in character, dis
tribution of seasonable goods at retail
being retarded by cool or rainy
weather at the West, Northwest and
South, where truck fruit, products and
young cotton are reported damaged
by frosts. Industries, however, are
active, jobbing trade at some centers
is still good and retail business toward
the latter end of the week became
more animated.
Building is brisk, money is firmer,
bank clearings having increased
heavily, - prices in general display a
downward tendency, weakness in
grain and securities being especial fea
tures. Railway earnings are still on
the up grade and Western wheat crop
prospects continue favorable, timely
rains helping with the wheat, though
cold weather has delayed spring wheat
and oats seeding and plowing. While
iron and stee! still continue buoyant,
demand for pig and other iron is l*ss
pronounced and the markets therefore
present a quiet appearance. Inquiries
for foreign billets are numerous, their
scarcity here being the immediate fea
ture in the market. American houses
are said to be figuring on the con
struction of iron and steel works in
Japan and China. It is usually a quiet
season for jobbers, but paints, oils,
lumber, plumbers' supplies and build
ing material are active, while agri
cultural implements are in good re
quest. Here and there industrial dis
turbances have cropped up, but so far
the situation in this respect is very
satisfactory.
MARKET QUIET BUT FIRM.
Coke prices have softened con
siderably during the week. Anthra
cite coal ia active, but the soft coal
situation is rather unsatisfactory, re
cent concessions in the district having
placed those sections at a disadvantage
as compared with Western regions.
The wool market is quiet but firm as
regards old supply of wool. Foreign
grades, however, are. In good demand.
Cm the Pacific Coast the outlook
seems without a flaw. A very heavy
export trade with Asia is looked for
on the coast this year.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending April 20 number
183. against 196 last week, and 199 in
the same week in 1904, 152 in 1903 181
in 1902 ard 214 in 1901.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber twenty-one, as against twenty-one
last week and eleven in this week a
year ago.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending April 20 are 1.242 267
bushels, against 1.292,301 last week. 1,
645,425 this week last year, and 3.885.542
in 1903. From July to date the ex
ports are 51.087.914 bushels, against
120,712,997 last year, and 133,672,023 in
1903.
RESULTS ARE SATISFACTORY.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s review of trade
to-mormw will say:
Erratic weather has tended to make
trade reports somewhat irregular, but
on the whole the week's results were
satisfactory. Early delays were fol
lowed by increased activity, particular
ly in what might be termed Easter
times. It is noteworthy that much
business for fall delivery has appeared
and more supplementary spring and
summer contracts are being placed
than jobbers anticipated. Mercantile
payments are also increasingly prompt.
Industrial activity expands, iron fur
naces and steel mills maintain their
good record, textile plants securing
larger orders, and footwear manufac
turers are able to hold full prices
without curtailing operations. Labor
controversies are few and cause little
inconvenience, while immigration for
the last week will be more than double
that <A the corresponding week in 1904.
Transporting interests are able to han
dle the increased business with little
congestion, railway earnings thus far
reported for April exceeding last year's '
by 10.2 per cent. Foreign commerce at
this port for the last week showed a
gain of $2,069,861 in value of merchan- '
disc exported and imports were $3 -
415,922 larger than in the same week of
1904.
Jobbin" trade at Salt Lake City is
noDjnal for the city and somewhat bet
ter than a y-ear ago. San Francisco
real estate is active, building contracts
large and money abundant.
Packer hides are strong and active
Foreign dry hides are unchanged.
Failures this week number 200 In the
United States, against 241 last year
and twenty-one in Canada, compared
with twelve a year ago.
are known to the policy holders I believe that
all right-minded men among them will be as
indignant aB 1 am with the methods that have
be*n employed by my enemies for their own
ends. In pursuing which they have not hesi
tated to sacrifice the best intereÂ«s of the so
ciety and to disregard the proper protection of
the policy holders.
You probably know in a general way of the
circumstances under which I was hastily sum
moned to the offics* of the president by tele
phone from the country un the eve of ths
annual meeting and shortly before the exnira
tion of the trust under which my stock is held
that I was there confronted without previous
notice or warning with a memorial of officers
and employes v.hieh had been secretly clrcu
late<l and in many instances signed under coer
cion; that my Immediate retirement was de
manded under threats; that I peremptorily
refused to retire. *nd that such refusal was
followed by the immediate submission to the
board of directors of a demand for my retire
ment and for the practical aisfrar.chlsement if
the stock of the society.
The plea cf mutuallratlon was a mere sham
under cover of which it was designed by these
leaders to wrett the control of the society
from the responsible hands of the most repre
sentative body of directors in the country
and to transfer it to their own grasp through
the use of the agencies as Instrumentalities
I can understand the desire of your body
for mutuaJixatlon. but I have never believed
and I do not now believe, that a system of
control which virtually places the agents over
the directors and officers Is sound In principle
I offered to place my stock in the hands of
trustees for five years, to be voted in ac
cordance with the directions of the board of
directors. I could hardly have given a stronger
evidence of my solicitude for the welfare of
the society. This offer was not accepted.
It is evident that I have been designedly
tricked. Thug far I am the only person In
this controversy who has made any sacrifices
The others have no such substantial interests
In the society and nothing to lose by this
warfare against Its prosperity. I now know
that those sacrifices which I have been de
ceived into making have been simply an en
couragement to further attempted Invasions ot
the rights of stockholders.

He's particularly interesting to
women, who feel a sort of pity for
him âfor such of him as knowa no
home, no hallowed spot that his
thoughts may hark back to, when the
smoke curls up from his pipe in the
fo'castle.
So they've'made a home for him â
here in our big city of homes, at 85
Steuart street, and called it the Sea
man's Institute. HÂ«re Jack's made
welcome when his ship rides In from
the sea. Here he may cast anchor and
be safe from the storm and stress of
"the coast," the lure of the tarrying
mariner. Here at the home are com
forts, entertainment and companion
ship. Sometimes these hold him â
sometimes the tide of temptation runs
too strong.
Now, it takes dollars to maintain a
home. And if It costs a hundred to
run a home for two, what do you sup
pose it costs to run a home for 200?
The institute must have money for
its current expenses.
Jack must be looked after, and
money must be on hand to do it.
Therefore a wide-awake coterie of
Fmart pet folk will appear on Monday
night at the Alhambra in vaudeville,
which will include on its menu a. skit

BELONGS TO BIG
GOULD SYSTEM
Promoters of Western Pa
cific Admit New Line Is
a Rio Grande Extension
JEFFREY FOR PRESIDENT
To Succeed Bartnett, Who Is
to Be Made a Vice Presi
dent and Chief Counsel
At last the promoters of the West
ern Pacific Railway Company have
abandoned the secrecy that has
marked their operations since the new
transcontinental road was conceived
and have formally announced that the
Goulds are behind the project. Yes
terday J. Dalzell Brown, treasurer of
the company, stated that he had been
authorized by President Bartnett, who
is still in New York, to make public
the fact that the Goulds are behind
the road and that it will be used as a
Western system of the Denver and Rio
Grande and share the Gould line ter
minal at Salt Lake.
After much deliberation the West
ern Pacific has decided to enter Cali
fornia by way of Beckwith Pass,
which will afford the road a grade of
1 per cent over the Sierras eastward
bound and eight-tenths of 1 per cent
westward bound. Another announce
ment made yesterday was to the ef
fect ' that the arrangements for the
financing of the road have been
completed in the East, where the
banking firms of Blair & Co., William
Solomon & Co. and William Reid &
Co. have agreed to act as the syndi
cate managers.
As stated several days ago in. The
Call, work on the western end of the
new line will be started within a few
weeks, Immediately after the con
tractors, Flick & Johns, have com
pleted an inspection of the route be
tween this city and Salt Lake City.
Point Richmond, by reason of its con
venience, will be the base for supplies.
In a few days the local directors of
the nsw road will leave for New York,
where the company is to hold a meet
ing. It is reported on good authority
that E. T. Jeffrey of the Denver and
Rio Grande road, who was recently
elected vice president of the Western
Pacific, will be chosen to succeed Bart
nett as president and that the board
of directors will be reorganized to per
mit the financial factors in the big
enterprise to be properly represented.
Bartnett is scheduled for the position
of vice president and general counsel,
making his headquarters in this city,
as does Chief Counsel Herrln of the
Southern Pacific lines.

A VTEW OF THE RAVD.
A vastly Interesting aeries of state
ments relating to the Rand mining;
problem* Is contributed by Thomas
Kaigfct Leggett and other facts of
scarcely leas interest regarding dia
mond mining are presented. About the
Rand, Leggett says in part:
The question has naturally arisen as to what
depth mining would ultimately reach on the
Rand. Tills touches closely upon the matter
of the goid ocntents of the reefs and their pay
ability. TV ith . the object of endeavoring to
form some Idea of bow much gold there was
in the known area of these reefs. I had the
hcaor of collaborating. In 1902, with Dr. Fred
erick H. Hatch, in the preparation of an es
timate of the gold production and life of the
main reef series down to 6000 feet.
This does not mean that in our opinion the
Band reefs would be worked everywhere to
a vertical depth of 6000 feet, but as It was
necessary to set tome limit, and as it is evi
dent that the reefs could be worked out to
this depth without sinking a single vertical
fhart of 6000 feet in depth, but by means of
Incline shifts at thÂ« bottom of the verticals
from 45C0 to 6000 feet deer, we felt it safe to
estimate the gold contents to this limit. There
Is no doubt in my mind that the miners
cf the Rand will feel th*lr way to these great
er depth? la the future Just a* they hayÂ« done
in tne past.
The profitable yield from the first row of
deep level mines encouraged the more strenu
ous <Sevelei>irient of the second row, the mines
of which are now reaching the producing stage;
and this. I take it. will be the case with thÂ«
third and any successive row. My personal
crtnion is that beyond the third row of deep
lrve^ there will be very few vertical shafts.
as it trill b- feasible to work out payable
ground by long Inclines from the bottoms of
the shafts already projected and in course of
sacking.
in speaking of the working capital neces
sary for th* development of the deep-l*vel
properties en the Rand. -I am telling nothing
new hen I pay that ThÂ» mines In the first
row d deep-levels have expended from | two
end a half to three million dollars each for
development end Â«julpmÂ«nt ' before getting
out a Binrle. ounce of gold. But with a gold
deposit of pebble-conglomerate lying in ;Befll
rfientary strata, and proven by boreholes to a
depth of 4880 feet, to say nothing of the hun
dreds of miles of workings now existing, this
comprehensive policy of mine development has
chown Itself to have been not only well found
ed, but commercially successful. At the same
time, like all policies, It has Its limits and
cannot be carried too far in exploiting the
deep-level area of the Rand without Inviting
Cli-aster: henoe my remark that the nsinere of
(tie Rand will undoubtedly "fee! their way"
in the exploitation of the greater depths bo
fcre undertaking too bwry expenditures in
deep rhafts.

the output through the imposition of
official regulations. In part Leggett
says: :
Ther* Is one Interesting point !n reference
to diamond mining in the Transvaal, and that
la the recently enacted diamond law. The Gov
ernment has takÂ«n 60 per cent of every dia
mond mliM discovered In the Transvaal, leaving
tha owner* 40 per cent. As a consequence of
this profit of Â£1.371,375, which the Premier
expects to make this coming year, the Gov
ernment will ret Â£822,000.
This la a law that has been enacted einoe
the advent of the new Government and applies
only to the Transvaal. ThÂ« highest dividends
paid by the gold mines was in 1698. amounting
to Â£4,800.000. The Government told tax is
10 per cent of the profits. That means Â£480.000
a year the Government will a-Â«t out of the
Tranevaal gold mines when they produce about
Ji lf 000,0(10. as they did In 188S and will do in
mm.
Now, out of one diamond mine, the
Premier, last year, the Government's Â»harÂ« is
Â£420,000, or almost as large an lncomÂ« as
from all th* gold mines of thÂ« country com-
Maat
I do not think it Is too much 1 to anticipate
that inside of two years thÂ« â¢ lnoomÂ« of the
23* a " r **l OoTÂ«rnment from this diamond mine
will far sxossd the income of the 10 per cent
tax on profits from the entire cold-mining in
dustry. \
In the matter of tils 60 per cent thÂ« old law
** T v* t the dlsoorerer of a diamond mine onÂ«-
'â¢/-Â£: th * â¢â *â¢*- That is to say. If a mine
had 3000 claimi he would ablÂ« to take one
'v,. 1 or â¢ Â«thlng near 400 claims. The
puWio could than step In and locate all the ad
d.tlonai inÂ». In such caae. howsTer, they
would have a repetition of thÂ« experience in
Klmberly. namely, of breaking the diamond
market a m.
The people .would/ work this ground, which
.Â«â  easily washed, and the market would -be
Hooded with diamonds Therefore the Gov
ernment took the attitude of saying: "We will
Â»â¢ the public to take these additional claims In
order to pr*TÂ»nt this dieaster (and It was a
treat disaster In KlmbeTly. unquestionably).
ana w * will satisfy the owner by giving them
40 cer cent of the mine. Instead of 12^ per
â¢eat, reserving the balance for ourselves."
" w *Â» discussed for seme time, a com
rewslon was appointed and a number of en
gineers were called to give technical advice,
It was. however, finally passed that the Gov
ernment should hare 60 per cent of the dia
mond mine and of all future" diamond discov
eries They allow the owner* of the mine to
deduct the cost of equipment, etc., and after
that they share thÂ« profit They thus prevent
any floo<J|Â»g of the diamond market.

KAHN ARGUES
FOR WITTMAN
Counsel Cites Authorities
to Show Police Board Had
So Right to Try Chief
QUOTES CITY CHARTER
Congressman Contends That
Charter Limits Kiglit of
Trial by the Commission
Judge Hunt has taken under advise
ment the question as to the leeral
method that must be pursued by ex-
Chief of Police George W. Wittman to
secure a review by the courts of the
proceedings taken before the Board of
Police Commissioners that resulted in
his dismissal from his position.
A demurrer interposed by the City
Attorney to Wittinan's petition for a
writ of mandamus was argued yester
day morning. Judge Hunt ordered
counsel to submit points and authori
ties in support of their various con
tentions, the time allowed being fif
teen days. This means that perhaps a
month will pass before a decision on
this point will be reached. An inter
ested audience listened to the argu
ment, among those taking notes being
the new Police Commissioner. O'Gradv.
and Attorney Fabius Finch, formerly
connected with the law offices of A.
When the case was called for ar
gument Assistant City Attorney Bro
beck made the point that the ex-Chief
was improperly proceeding to attain
his end. Quo warranto proceedings to
determine title to the office, or pro
ceedings in certiorari looking to the
review and annulment of the proceed
ings taken by the Police Commission
ers, he said, would be the rÂ»rooer course
for Wittman to pursue. He asked that
the demurrer interposed on behalf of
the commission be sustained.
MANDAMUS IS PROPER.
Congressman Julius Kahn. who reD
resents Wittman, differed in hie view,
however, and cited authorities by the
score supporting his contention that
mandamus i 6 the only and proper rem
edy in the case at bar. He said the
City and County Attorney had rea
soned from the standpoint that title to
the office in question was to be deter
mined, while no such contention had
been urged by the petitioner. The at
torney continued as follows:
It Is our contention that Â»he title is al
ready determined: that Mr. Wittman has been
appointed to serve for four years and that
he was Illegally removed prior to the expira
tion of his term. Xot only do we maintain
that he was not given a fair and Impartial
trial, but we maintain that no matter what
offense he may have been guilty of, though
we know he has committed none, the Police
Commission ha* no power to try him and an
li-spection of the charter will sustain us in,
our i>osltlon.
Chapter 7 of article 8 of the charter de
fining the duties of the Board of Police Com
missioners, confers no authority upon the
Board of Police Commissioners to try the
Chief of Police and by implication It forbids
it. The charter says that the Police Depart
ment shall consist of a Board of Police Com
missioners, a Chief of Police, to be appointed
to serve four yearn, officeri and patrolmen,
to be appointed under civil service provisions,
acd clerks.
RIGHT OF TRIAL LIMITED.
It Is expressly given the power to try for
offenses, real or alleged, only those members
of the force that axe appointed during good
behavior. The Chief of Police is in himself
a unit of the department, whose term In office
Is fixed and he Is an ex-officto member of the
commission. The commission has no more
right to try him than it would have to try
one of its own members.
Now, another point. The charter strictly
provides that no man shall become a member
of the police force itself, as distinguished from
the Police Commission and the office of Chief
of Police, who Is under 21 or over 36 years
of age. When the late Chief Sullivan was
appointed this question arose, but it was de
termined that notwithstanding the fact that
he was 42 years of age he was eligible to
appointment as he did not come within the
provisions of the charter fixing the age limit
of members admitted under the civil service
rules.
Nor does Jhe office come under that pro
vision of thÂ« charter providing for promotion
of members, for if it had Mr. IMnan could
never have been made Chief of Police and the
office would have gone to Captain Splllane,
the senior officer of his rank. Every pro
vision of the charter relating to the police
force considers the office of Chief of Police
an a unit separate from the department over
th' members of which the commission ha/i
the right of trial. It Is our contention that
the Board of Police Commissioners had no
right to try Mr. Wittman and that when it
took this authority to Itself it acted illegally
and dismissed him afer a partial and man
ifestly illegal and unfair trial.
A LOS ANGELES CASE.
Our contention that mandamus is a proper
proceeding to be taken to restore Mr. Witt
man to the office he occupied was sustained
this month by the Supreme Court in the case
of Davenport against Los Angeles. Mr. Daven
port waa removed from office under the "re
call" provision of the charter of that city,
but the Supreme Court held that as he was
appointed for a fixed term of office the right
of removal did not vest In the City Council
that tried him. The court ordered him re
stcrfd t o his office.
All of the text book writers are unanimous
In the opinion that mandamus Is the propel
remedy to secure the restoration of one to
office "that has been illeeally removed. We
will admit that if Mr. Wittman had never
held the office and sought to get It after ap
pointment from one that refused to yield it
the only <'ourne for us to follow would be to
Institute an action In quo warranto. This
is not the condition here, however, and we
shall stand by the course we are pursuing.
In the event that Judge Hunt de
cides that a writ shall issue the entire
case will be reviwed by the court, and
then, if it is found that Wittman was
removed, through the result of a con
spiracy, as is commonly charged, his
restoration to office will he neremDto
rily ordered.

SECOND WIFE DECLINES
TO DIVIDE HER BURDEN
Scorns Husband's Hint That Wife No. 1
Would Help Her Support Him.
He Confesses Inability to Understand
Perversity of Feminine Mind.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
When his first wife obtained divorce
and thus deprived him of sustenance
George Grassell quickly led to the altar
a second provider of his creature neces
saries and luxuries, and when she com
plained of the heaviness of the burden
he considerately suggested that she
invite her predecessor in his household
to shoulder one-half of it. With fem
inine perversity, however, she declined
to share with any woman the marital
responsibility she had undertaken, and
alone she sturdily bore it until mater
nity compelled her to apply for aid to
the Society for the Prevention of Cru-
elty to Children. Result, arrest of the !
husband and father and his arraien
ment before Police Judge Mosran on
the charge of having failed to provide |
for his minor offspring. The complaint I
was sworn to by Mrs. WatÃon of 118
Page street, in whose custody the in
fant has been while its mother worked
1 as a domestic for a family residing: on
Washington street.
Mr. Grassell told the court that he
I was at a loss to explain the spirit of
selfishness which prevented wife No. 2
assigning to wife No. 1 a portion of the
| expense of his board, lodging, washing.
| tobacco and beer. He could only at
j tribute No. 2's obstinacy to the unrea
j son that is inseparable from her sex.
So long as he was willing to have No.
1 admitted to his household, and that
'â  lady herself had entered no demurrer.
. he failed to see any logical ground for
! No. 2's objection. It was this areu-
I ment that prompted Clerk "Pat" Gray
| to dash off the following lines and hand
: them to the Prosecuting Attorney:
George Gr&gael reclined In hie flrst wife's bed,
: His second wife's pillow under his head,
His third wife's ooverlet over his hide,
i His fourth wife slumbering by his side.
Mr. Gray modestly disclaimed author
ship of the quatrain, but the attorney's
; table opined he did so because of dls
| inclination to have the taxpayers imae-
I me he was frittering away their money
by trifling with the muse during his
hours of officialism.
In response to a query from the
j bench Mr. Grassell stated he was a
contracting painter unable to obtain
â¢ employment. "And you'd better figure
on that," he added, tapping the palm of
! his left hand with the index finger of
I his right ditto. "Before sending wie to
; jail you should figure on the fact that
I jobs are hard to get."
"I'd do so," said his Honor, "and
while you are figuring on what your
sentence may be you might as well
make due allowance for the absolute'
certainty that it shall be as severe as
j the law prescribes for your offense. You
may now return to the cage and plunge
| into mental calculation."
Before the same magistrate Albert
Heissner also stood accused of having
failed to provide, the victims of his ne
glect being two children, aged respec
tively three and six years. Mrs., Jen
nie Horan of 453 Ellis street was the
complainant. The defense was that
Mrs. Heissner, who works in a cigar
store, loved dancing so passionately
that she spent most of her nights trip
ping the light fantastic, while Mrs.
Horan took care of the little ones.
"If you devote more time to terpsl
chore than to your babies they will
be taken away from you," the Judge
warned Mrs. Heissner, and then to Mr.
Heissner he said: "The police records
show that you are an incorrigible
loafer and have already spent thirty
days in jail for the yery same offense
now charged against you. To-morrow
I shall sentence you to the limit,
which is six months."
But worst of all cases of paternal
neglect was that in which George
Chapman stood accused before Judge
Fritz. It was testified that Mr. Chap
man was father of seven, the oldest
of whom is sixteen, and their support
almost since their birth has devolved
upon his mother-in-law, Mrs. Eliza
Freeman of 1318 Dupont street, who
works as a house servant, although
her age is seventy-one years.
Like the party by the name ; of
Grassell.% this :.'. defendant ; ; informed the
court that !>! > he was â a contracting
painter N unable Ito obtain ; work. 'ti\ His
utterance - of v the ; statement â ;', was '<â  so
thick as to expose inebriety, and the
Judge ordered that he be kept In v cus
tody â â :â  until rlto-dayV%when , the a extreme
penalty will undoubtedly be r prescribed
for him.
Officers Young and Walsh found the
entire Chapman family dwelling in one
squalid room on Howard street, near
Third, and when they undertook to
arrest the unnatural husband and
father he fought them like a demon,
after taking from one of his pockets
a handful of silver coins, probably
earned by his wife's aged mother, and
throwing thena in the street. George,
the eldest chila, was the only one of
the seven who brought any money^ to
the home, his contribution being $1 BO
a day. For years the unfortunate little
ones have been recipients of aid from
the Associated Charities and other
eleemosynary institutions, their father
spending for drink most of the money
earned by their grandmother.

Tetrazzinl's limpid voice was heard
in Judge Conlan's chambers, where
she sat awaiting summons to testify
against Julio Ziegner Uriburu, whom
she accuses of having embezzled 27,000
franks while serving as her financial
agent. The diva's vocal impairment
was only -temporary; -and- she could

audience with entrancing melody.
But the songbird was not called to
court. Ex-Judge A. B. Treadwell and
Attorney George Collins, for the de
fense, asked for and obtained a con
tinuance till this morning. Otto Hey
nemann, Tetrazzini's counsel, acquies
cing. Senor Uriburu had nothing to
say, not was Bazelli, that tenor of the
ah-so-silvery tone, asked to speak. It
was incidentally stated that the J465
found in Senor Urlburu's possession
when he was arrested is in the hands
of the police property clerk. Signor
Wanrell, who booked Tetrazzini to
sing in Mexico, claims the money.
Owing to the illness of the com
plaining witness, Paul Q. Smith, the
jury trial of Daniel Creighton, uccused
of "selling a pool," was continued till
next Thursday by Judge Mogan. Mr.
Smith is confined in St. Winifred's
Hospital, and to make sure that he
was really sick and unable to appear
in court, the Assistant District Attor
ney visited the hospital and returned
with information that there was no
pretext whatever about the man's con
dition.
James Gallagher, driver of a coal '
wagon, stopped his vehicle in the mid
dle of the car tracks on Sixteenth
street and for ten minutes obstructed
traffic, to the great annoyance of pas
sengers who were in a hurry to reach
their respective destinations. Motor
neers and conductors clustered around
the obstacle and alternately coaxed
and swore at Mr. Gallagher to drive
on, but he calmly sat upon his lofty
perch and challenged them to ascend
and compel him to do as they desired.
Thus the blockade stood when a car
among whose Inmates was Patrolman j
Joseph joined the waiting line. Ere '
he became a peace guardian Mr. Jo- ,
seph was a teamster and report had it |
that no man could handle the ribbons >
more deftly than he, so with expert |
eye he immediately saw that it was
Mr. Gallagher instead of the horse
that was balking.
"Why don't you drive on?" inquired
the officer.
"Why don't you make me drive on?"
was the coal deliverer's retort.
The implied invitation was promptly
accepted. But when the man in uni
form climbed to the wagon seat its I
occupant refused to relinquish the
reins and in the ensuing struggle for
possession both men rolled to the road
way. After clearing the track the po
liceman arrested Mr. Gallagher and
booked him for battery and obstruct
ing a streetcar. Judge Conlan pro
nounced both charges proved and will
speak the sentence to-day.

Mr. and Mrs. Hening, prompted by
Judge Fritz, kissed and made up in
open court and departed arm in arm.
Mr. Hening had been charged with
having failed to provide for his better
half, who had instituted suit for di
vorce, and she not only withdrew the
accusation but informed the magis
trate that she would also quash the
proceedings for separation. And the
Judge seemed to relish his function as

Henry Brandt, a young fellow, at
tired in a striped sweater and display
ing an awry eye and a cauliflower ear,
pleaded that it was for the pur
pose of repairing a poor little
boy's bicycle that he robbed
his employers, the Aleos Freed
Company, 1734 Market street, of tires
and pedals and handle bars and pumps
anil other appurtenances to the
spidery wheel. It was proved, how
ever, that for six months he had
steadily been pilfering and concealing
his plunder in a coat which had been
furnished with capacious pockets for
that very purpose. Judge Mogan will
sentence him for petty larceny.
Fred Tiernan declared that while he
knew he was shot, he did not recollect
how, where or by whom the shot was
fired, although Thomas Dougherty
stood charged with the crime. Judge
Conlan then continued the hearing of
the case against Mr. Dougherty until
next Wednesday and hinted to Mr.
Tiernan that in the interest of justice
it would be well for him to undergo
a course of memory culture ad interim.

Philosopher liakewell. Called
to Yale. Scores Califor

ROAKT FOR PLAGIARISM
1 of <; en nine College
Spirit Is Explained to
Youth of the University
BERKELEY, Apr;! 21.â Professor C.
M. Bakewell made his farewell address
to university students to-day at Har
mon gymnasium, and incidentally
mftde his hearers pquirm by straight
talk regarding what constitutes real
college spirit. Professor Bakewell Is In
the department of philosophy. He has
been called to Yale, as head of the
eaxne department there. Apropos of his
removal to the Eastern university,
Bakewell epoke of attempts made here
to Imitate Yale's traditions and cus
toms, a practice which he declared was
not conducive to the growth of gen
uine college spirit, or calculated to en
hance the prestige of the University
o* California. Speaking of this mat
ter Professor Bakewell said:
Yale spirit vas a tiling unknown her* six
rears spo. A fÂ»w years agro, however, we took
to imitating Tale, with ha.*. results to us, and
when Stanford stole our imitation of Ell's tra
ditional fence, we all rejoiced thereat. We
cannot deveicp any virtues through plagiarism.
College spir!t is a natural, contagion. In a
small eollf p* a certain soliaarlty and spirit is
acquired which takes years to develop In a
large ua'ver^lty.
In California T.e have grown too quickly,
arid It is now impossible for Ftudents and fac
ulty tc mingle as in the minor lnstitutone. Such
men as Sill, Le Come and Kellogg have helped
creal* ro!!<-gpe Fpirtt. and we are striving to
maintain ant? develop it. Now we are divided
in many camps. We only come together on the
athlete Held. We are going through a period
cf transition and we have a. difficult path to
follow. Getting together .Â»ua shouting is not
ooUege spirit, but a mere symptom of it.
Thtre is only one way to acquire real college
erjirit, and that Is to develop humanity in us
is Â« acquire an education, and not merely
acquire a profession nat will enable us to
livÂ«*
We are becoming provincial. I fear, and that
rot becaus* of our It-elation, but through fail
ure to make cur educational work Include the
development of soul and spirit. It Is true that
no man can enjoy the products of civilization
if he has only prepared himself for hie occu
pation in life.
It is a matter of regret to me that more
students are not taking the courses In philoso
phy at this university. Philosophy is espe
cially concerned with humanity and life, and
in itÂ» Ftudy her* there is an opportunity for
students- tc meet and mingle with one who

JOYFUL NEWS
BERKELEY. April 21.â News that
brought delight to all the university
students who are compflled to drill
in military fashion was received by
President Wheeler from the War De
partment at Washington to-day, the
information conveyed being that here
after neither juniors nor seniors shall
be required to drill. Drill will be held
three days each week, however, begin
ning with the drill in August.
This order of the War Department
is understood to be the result of con
certed action by the land grant col
leges of the country, these institutions
having united last fall in a petition
to the Government asking that the
drill regulations be modified and made
less onerous.
President Wheeler went East last
month and presented the university's
Bide of the question in person to Sec
retary of War Taft. The military men
are loth, apparently, to see the regu
lations under which the military de
partments of colleges operate modi
fied, but in deference to the united
petition of the institutions affected the
order Just received by President
Wheeler vat promulgated.
So strong was the feeling in army
circles over this matter that the last
number of the Army and Navy Regis
ter devoted a lengthy editorial to a
criticism of President Wheeler's stand
in the matter, declaring that the War
Department was not likely to take any
step which would lessen the drilling
or other features of military Instruc
tion in colleges that receive Govern
ment aid. Military men's ideas of the
affair are understood to be mirrored
in the editorial, which Is in part as
follows: â¢
If the professor standing at the head of the
University of California, Benjamin Ide Wheel
er, has been correctly quoted by .reporters of
the Baa Francisco papers, he is cherishing the
notion* of a material modification of the re
quirements adopted by the War Department,
after considerable consideration of the subject,
for the government of those colleges and uni
versities In all parts of this country where are
on duty military officers in the capacity of
professors of military science and the art of
w"nr. That college functionary has been in
Washington and hag appeared at the War De
portment Â«is the representative of his own in
stitution as wtll as of other* of the same
class, among the faculty of . which more or
less objection exists to the present rules im
posed by the general staff (or the conduct of
the military departments' of â¢ those educational
Institutions. This objection, of course, is
bei><?d entirely on the assumption that too much
is expected by the War Department, and that
the students of the colleges are required, in
an excessive degree, to attend the lectures and
drills m the military department. â 
The official reports from the army officers
who have inspected these colleges and the con
ditions existing there have indicated that
these objections were firmly rooted, and would
appear as 'a somewhat, effective block to the
scheme of the general staff for the encourage
ment of the military spirit in the college stu>
dent body. These colleges, as has been repeat
edly jointed out. are manifestly benefited by
th* existing conditions. "The laws of the coun
try give them very material favors In the way
of annual allotments from the public funds and
tl.fr gratuitous -service of army officers to act
a* instructors. It was considered that in re
turn for. these advantage' the colleges should
do something toward establishing and main
taining in this country among its youth an ap
preciation of loyalty and some familiarity with
military devices. \ This expectation on the part
of., the Government w?.s not prompted -by
tbeory. It was realized that there . would : be
ample turn In -time, of emergency . for thÂ«
Income given to' colleges and for the free
detail of army officers for the maintenance of
the rnilHhry departments. '
' Now. It appears that .the colleges are tin
willing to assume their chare In the respon
sibility and to yield anything like a Just re
turn for the advantages which have been theirs
without â¢ ro*t or trouble. The whole subject
has evidently been reopened since : the . criti
cisms, complaints and objections which come
f ronr college sources have cone once more be
fore the general staff. There will naturally be
considerable Interest in th* result. Of coarse,
it may appear from the information which "has
reached the War Department that the <. exist
ing rules, hitherto considered reasonable, and
possible at execution, are. not practical .when
applied to college government. It â¢ will * sup
port the pression, formerly reached In vari
ous quarter*, that If â  the t military depart
ment* Â«re a failure and cannot' be "maintained,
the detail of army officers to college duty
should be . discontinued and the allotments
rrsde to the colleges should be reduced, if not
canceled.: ..â¢â'â¢

TRYING TO FIND
HEAD SMUGGLER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 21.â The examina
tion of the nineteen contraband Chin
ese captured in this city yesterday
morning is still going at police head
quarters under the direction of Chief of
Immigration Mehan. The examina
tion of the men will not be completed
until some time this evening.
The capture of the Chinese was due
to the fact that a switchman in the
yards here had noticed that the seal
on the car was broken and reported
the matter to the railroad authori
ties. This seal must have been broken
in this city, or it would have been no
ticed at the other division points on the
railroad. This leads to the supposition
that an agent of the smugglers in this
city about to liberate the Chinese was
frightened away.
The capture of the Mongolians is be
lieved to be one of the most important
made in a number of years. To-mor
row the prisoners will be taken by
United States Marshal Shine to San
Francisco.
Several attempts have been made by
the Chinese to get letters taken out by
trusties of the City Prison and mailed
to frienifs in San Francisco. These
letters have been turned over to the
officials now conducting the examina
tion of the men here.

PLOT IS FRUSTRATED
â¦Japs Try to Destroy Ammu

Lying Near Troopshfr.
FIRE IX FERRY DEPOT
Had the attempt of the Japanese at
Manila to destroy the disabled British
Fteamer Carlisle succeeded, the army
transport Sherman, which arrived here
on Sunday, would have been blown to
I ieces and all on board killed. The
officer* of the Sherman still shudder
when they talk about their narrow es
cape. The Carlisle is the British
tramp which lost her propeller while on
her way to Vladivostock with a cargo
of arms and ammunition. She took ref
uge at Manila and by special permis
sion from Washington was allowed to
stay there.
Japanese living at Manila decided to
â erve their country by destroying
this friend of their country's enemy.
Taking a large quantity of dynamite
they rowed out to the Carlisle on the
night of March 7. They were seen by
the people on the Carlisle and scared
away. They returned the next night,
however, and only withdrew after sev
eral shots had been fired at them.
The American authorities were ap
peaJed to for protection, and the
thfrd night a rapid flre gun was install
ed on the Carlisle's deck and the po
lice boat Bucky O'Neill steamed
around the British steamer during the
hour* of darkness. The next day the
Carlisle was taken inside the breaic
* ater for better protection.
On an old hull used as a meeting
place by Japanese was found a quan
tfty of dynamite, with fuse and caps

Th^ Manga Reva'* Troubles.
The life of the chip Manga Reva from the
Cay many months ago when, as the British

with her cargo of coal ablaze on a South Sea.
island <nral reef to the present time has been
filled with trouble and her tribulations are not
yet over. Captain Thayer of this city bought
the charred and stranded hull. After months
ft hard work he got her afloat, rigged her
and .-a.;-d her to this port. Here she was
jjractlcally rebuilt and b- special act of Con
a.mi] Â«m given American register. She has
boÂ«i chartered to carry a cargo of sugar from
Hone lulu to New York, but there are more dif
ficulties to be overcome before she gtts away.
The contract for rigging the vessel was given
to a non-union firm in Oaftland. The work
was not comoleted when the vessel was char
tered. She was hauled to this side and dock*d
at Union street wharf to take on ballast and
while, the stiffening was being loaded Captain
Thayer exi>ected to have the work of rigging
the v*sst! completed. When the union riggers
engaged to do the work found yesterday that
nan-union men had been engaged in the first
I>lace t>*ey refused to work unless all the
work set ud by- mob-union- labor Is first torn
down. This Captain Thayer will not â  p*r.mli.
bince he bought the wreck of the Pyrenees
Captain Thayer has been busy overcoming ob
etsicn't. and the history -' the evolution of
the- Manga Reva from the charred shell of
the Pyrenees is the story of one of the pluckl
*â *â â¢< Fingle-handed fights against a succession
of adversities recorded In the marine history
of the Pacific If the riggers will not do the
needful work on the Manga Reva it is probable
that the work will be left for the crew to
finish after the v-.-sel ft? to sea. After all
hÂ«r has gone through a little question of union
ethics is not going to prevent Captain Thtyer
sending his ship on the voyage for which she
has been engaged.

MILK COMPANY
IS IN STRAITS
Attachments Levied on Prop
erty of the Workingmen's
Co-operative Corporation
LABOR FIGHT INVOLVED
Drivers' Union fiefuses to
Aid the Concern When It
Reduced the Ketail Price
As an outcome of the fight the
Dairymen's Association, assisted by
the Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, has
waged against the Workingmen's Co
operatice Company two attachments
have been placed against the latter
concern. One is levied on the com
pany at its office at 205 Ninth street by
the Curtin Collection Agency for
$329 16 and the other by the Raver
Collection Agency for $100. Posses
sion of wagonloads of milk brought
across the bay was taken under the
writs.
The officers of the Workingmen's
Co-operative Company, which was
formed six months ago by members of
the street railway union, admit that
the aggressive attacks of the opposing
dairymen have placed the company in
a bad way. They say, however, that
it is lack of capital that handicaps
them, as they have more than enough
money on outstanding bills to cover
the indebtedness.
The co-operative company was
formed for the purpose of supplying
workingmen's families with milk
cheaper than was formerly provided
by the Dairymen's Association. The
new concern cut the price down 50
cents a month to the consumer and
immediately acquired a large patron
age. Opposition developed where it
was least expected, however, and the
members of the Milk Wagon Drivers'
Union employed by the new company
soon began to complain.
Later they left the co-operative com
j pany and endeavored to disrupt it for
the alleged reason that the union had
made an agreement with the Dairy
men's Association not to drive for any
company that would cut the price of
milk to the consumer. It is said that
upon this agreement the ' dairymen
recognized the Milk Wagon Drivers'
Union.
The San Francisco Labor Council
was appealed to and gave its decision
in favor of the Workingmen's Co
operative Company, but the re
calcitrant union has failed to comply
with its mandate and continues to
antagonize the company.

BRONZE GROUP
FOR THE PARK
Aitken's "Luck of Roaring
Camp" May Be Placed in
Gulch Near the Aviary
MEMORY OF BRET HARTE
Commissioners Are Advised
That Hotaling's Hotel
Site Is Within Boundary
The Park Commissioners met at tbe
Palace Hotel yesterday afternoon, the
president of the board, A. B. Spreckels,
presiding. Commissioners R. H. Lloyd.
W. J. Dingee. W. H. Metion. Earl
Cummings and Superintendent John
McLaren attended the session.
A delegation from the Bohemian
Club, consisting of Willard T. Bar
ton, president; Robert I. Altken, the
sculptor, and Edgar Mathews, archi
tect, informed the Commissioners of
the club's desire that the Bret Harte
memorial in bronze, designed by Mr.
Aitken, should be placed in the quarry
or gulch near the aviary of Golden
Gate Park. It was stated that the
monument would bear this Inscription:
"In memory of Francis Bret Harte.
This group in bronxe was placed here
by the members of tha Bohemian Club,
nineteen hundred and five. Subject,
'The Luck of Roaring Camp.' Sculptor,
Robert I. Aitken."
Mr. Barton, in addressing the board,
remarked that the gulch mentioned
resembled in some degree a mining
camp and he requested that the Com
missioners should name it Bret Harte
Oulch.
The delegation was informed that the
Commissioners always referred topics
relating to the art of scuplture to the
artist member of the board, and such
reference was accordingly made in this
instance. Immediate action may be
taken by a special meeting of the Com
missioners, as Mr. Aitken has ar
ranged to sail for Europe at an early
data.
Captain Gleeson, commanding the po
flce force in the Golden Gate Park
district, stated to the board that he
had conferred with Superintendent Mc-
Laren. Assurance was given by the
captain that every effort would be
made to meet the wishes of the Com
missioners in the way of patrols on the
ocean beach on Sundays and holidays
and in attendance at the concerts.
Commissioner Lloyd directed the
board's attention to the fact that boys.
In disregard of the ordinance, pursue
the quail In Golden Gate Park and
kill the birds with air guns and sling
shots. It was announced that Officer
Clarke would renew his war on cats
and coyotes that molest the birds. On
motion of Mr. LJoyd, seconded by Mr.
Dingee, a resolution was adopted of
fering a reward of $50 for the arrest
of any person caught in the act of
molesting the quail in Golden Gate
Park.
The concession for printing the park
programme was awarded to the Phil
lips and Van Orden Company. The
firm offered $125 a month for the priv
ilege. A. J. Lyons, who was compelled
to surrender the concession because he
was losing money, was released on an
agreement that he should pay $35 a
month for the ensuing year. If Lyons
had not offered $250 a month for the
concession the board could have ac
cepted a bid of $160, hence he is re
leased on the payment of the difference
between $160 and $125. The board re
ferred the subject of adjustment to
Commissioner Metson. Lyon must pay
all arrears before his bondsmen are re
leased.
The Commissioners awarded to the
Bowers Rubber Company a contract for
3000 feet of one-inch rubber hose at 13
cents a foot and 1000 feet of one and a
quarter inch hose at 20 cents a foot.
A contract for 1000 feet of one-inch
hose at la^i cents a foot was awarded
to the Pacific Coast Hose Rubber Com
pany on a guarantee that the hose
would last two years.
The subject of lighting the Memor/xl
Museum was discussed. Commissi>iier
Cummings was requested to get t/i es
timate of the cost of wiring the build
ing.
Secretary Herbert Schmitz, c*i behalf
of G. Harris of Oakland, pres</ated the
Commissioners with a female /innamon
bear. Miss Bruin is aged y[ months
and is remarkably big and active for
her age. The bear pit in C/olden Gate
Park will be enlarged to a/commodate
her.
The Park Commissioners are advised
that the premises near the ocean
beach, on which R. M. Hotaling pro
poses to erect a large tavern, are with
in the park reservation. It is said that
the board will insist on strict adher
ence to the original lines of survey.

A NOVEL PENSION.
NEARLY all of the great railway systems of the country have
a pension system. Their employes are retired at a fixed age
and receive for the rest of their lives a pension, which is a
certain percentage of the average compensation earned during their
service. It is an excellent system. By it men are encouraged in
thrift and economy, so that they may have accumulations to add to
their pensions and increase their independence. On all roads where
this system is in operation there is less liability to labor strikes, and
the men have a sense of stability and responsibility which is an ele
ment in the safety and usefulness of the road itself.
Now appears a novel projection of the pension policy in a plan
adopted by the Rock Island and Frisco systems. Instead of a stated
money pension those roads propose to give each retiring employe a
homestead of 160 acres of land. They have selected lands in Colo
rado for this new kind of colonization, and the people of that State
are helping the plan ahead. This means that retired employes will I
not remain in cities, to increase the congestion of urban population,
but that instead they will add to the ranks of rural producers. As
railroad policy it is wise, because these producers will by the product I
"f their land add to the rail tonnage that has to be carried to market.
All well conducted railroads strive wisely to increase the settlement I
and production of the country through which they run.
There are in the country 1,000,000 railroad employes. They re
ceive the highest railroad wage,? paid in the world. They are men j
who know something. It is impossible for any man of fair intelli- j
jjence to be in contact with any part of a railway system without
learning something, acquiring some skill and getting ideas that equip
him for the duties of any calling to which he may resort for a living. |
There is evidence, furnished by the history of many railway employes
in California, that such men develop a taste for land and a desire
for i t s ownership. Train crew* run through the country. They see
it in its changing aspects as the seasons pass. They come in contact
with rural people and products, and a large percentage of them come
to look upon country life and land with a degree of favor that readily
leads them landward, as soon as they are able to follow their own
inclinations.
In the San Ramon Valley and other regions around Mount
Diablo, in Gontra Costa County, are many fine small plantations
owned by retired railroad men. In Tulare County are many pro
ductive farms owned by retired railroaders and also by men still in.
active service. Their fondness for land has made them economical,
and by saving their wages they are able to indulge their tastes. One
tract of land near Tulare is owned by a Southern Pacific engineer,
still in active service on a passenger locomotive. He has devoted
his leisure and his savings to the development of his lands and ranks
in the first class of farmers in his community.
Why not take advantage of this leaning landward and settle colo
nies of retired railroad men in this State, on land given them instead
of a money pension? We believe it will pay our California roads to
buy up some of the great ranches of the State, subdivide them and
give the land to employes in lieu of a money pension. While a tract
of 160 afcres in the climate of Colorado may be accepted as the land ,
unit necessary for a family, the unit may be much less here. A
family having industry and intelligence is assured of a good living
on 20 acres of California land of good quality. This is not a specu- ]
lation : it is a fact. In many counties families have acquired a com- j
petence on 10 and 15 acres, and Yolo County displays its celebrated i
one-acre farm that has enriched its owner. The great need of this 1
State is small landholders. To what class may we turn with greater
confidence for the supply than to the railroad men, operating our '
extensive lines, to whom we are under obligations for the safety J
and comfort of travel ? They are men of ideas, desirable citizens, and i
make for the strength of the State.
We are sure that if their different organizations take up the i
matter of a land pension, making its acceptance optional, and leaving
the money pension for such as prefer it, the officials of the different ,
companies will be led to consider it. The State is looking for settlers j
upon lands. Where can it find better? A money pension is spent'
aÂ«i it is received. It is beneficial, but it passes through the hands !
that receive it. It has a tendency to keep its recipients in cities,
where they are not needed, and when it is gone, it is gone. It is j
paid to the male head of the family and ceases when he dies, and j
perhaps leaves some helpless members of a family behind him.
But if it be in land, a home is built up, a permanent property is j
created, the producing forces of the State are recruited, and when
the head of ihe family passes away the means of a good living
remain for his family. Now is the time to consider this beneficial
policy. Many great land holdings are read)' to dissolve into smaller
units. They can be bought in a body at a wholesale price. Turned
into tracts of suitable size each family homestead will cost less than
a quarter section in Colorado. The land is easier reduced to tillage.
It brings a crop quicker and may be subjected to a greater variety
of uses. It can be made to produce something for sale every month
in the year, and is not under hard winter conditions. The railway
employes of California should give immediate attention to the sub
ject and they may find it of the greatest value to themselves and
their families and their employers.
OUR ANILINE BEVERAGES.
'THE Board of Health is rapidly destroying our confidence in
I things to drink. Of all the liqueurs, thit green and syrupy fluid
called creme de menthe has been supposed to be the most inno
cent of all evil designs. Its flavor recalls the mint julep of our old
Kentucky home, and its color reflects the vernal landscape where
the mint crop prows. Now it turns out that it is made of everything
except mint, and that it? lovely green is due to aniline dyes made
from repulsive and ill-smelling coal tar! Our French friends in
Bordeaux make this mixture and put it on the American market, and
with it we paint our interior green and produce a gentle after dinner
exhilaration.
Hereafter if an American wants mint in Ms liquor, let him take
the aromatic plant Itself, bruise it, bathe it in spirits and drink it,
innocent of coal tar and other things that are not intended to be
drunk, chewed or sniffed. If these revelations end in driving all
sorts of colored mixtures out of the market it will probably be better
for the public health. If an alcoholic beverage is to be used Â£t all
it i? better to take it naked and unadorned, for the imbiber will at
least know what he is swallowing. The public habit of taking these
foreign mixtures has led to the development of great ingenuity in the
Continental adulterations. One way to stop it is to reject these aniline
mixtures entirely. It is a fact that a lot of stuff is made in France
that has no market anywhere except in this country. We are sup-
K4 to be such guys that we will take anything.
The pre#s can suppress this sort of thing by exposing it. The
rational authorities should add their power to that of local health
boards, and make the extermination complete. An American stom
ach is too valuable to be destroyed by these foreign sophisticators.
We need it in our business and it is entitled to protection. There are
rj score of varieties of these alcoholic mixtures that come in fancy
bottles, illuminated by titles in various languages, and all justly ob
jects of suspicion. Let them be anathema, and also be spilled.
If the Moroccan sensation has caused satisfaction In Russia. It Is plain
that the dual alliance is on Its last legs and that a realignment of the powers
is Impending, The ~ bond between England and France will doubtless be
strengthened by the Kaiser's diplomatic T coup, and as Russia has never" liked
that development - her feelings toward the French may undergo a decided
chant* â Chicago Rscord-HÂ«ral4.

THE first telegram that came to
Mrs. Barton last Friday morning
read:
"Mother is ill. No serious dan
ger, but wants you to come at once.
"FATHER."
Mrs. Barton was too perturbed to
remember that her husband's only
aunt. Miss Wendell, was due to arrive
at the Union depot at 4:30 that after
noon. This circumstance was broueht
to her mind by the coming of a second
telegram that she opened with trem
bling fingers, fearing that her moth
er's condition would be worse. She did
not know whether she was relieved or
more troubled to read:
"Will reach Chicago to-day at 1:15
instead of 4:30. Union station.
"MART WENDELL."
Barton was on a business trip up In
Michigan and would not arrive home
until 6 o'clock that evening. Mrs. Bar
ton's train left Chicago at 11:46. What
was to be done with Aunt Mary?
Mrs. Barton had not much time in
which to think of what courses of ac
tion lay open to her. She snatched
at the only thought that came into her
head. "I have tickets for the orches
tra concert this afternoon for the two
of us," she thought. "Now, I have
never met Aunt Mary, but I am sure
that she will enjoy the concert'"â Mrs.
Barton has a happy way of judging
the rest of the world by J|er own pref
erencesâ"and I shall semi the tickets
down to her at the train. Katie will
take them. I can trust to her for find
ing the old lady."
Mrs. Barton took her own train,
leaving Katie in the station with a
note for Miss Wendell that was auite
lengthy under the circumstances. Con
trary to the way of stories. Katie found
Miss Wendell without the least difficul
ty and delivered the note to her. Miss
Wendell smiled at her and asked the
way over to Orchestra Hall. Â« Katie was
delighted to be the guide. Miss Wen
dell asked her timidly to remain with
her. Katie had had other plans for the
afternoon, but she was a most arree
able maid and expressed a willingness
to remain.
Mrs. Barton had procured excellent
seats for the occasion. Katie hoped
that MisS Wendell was enjoying the
programme. For her own part she
would have preferred a ragtime con
cert. But she was the custodian o*
the guest and she held to her post. She
piloted the guest out to the Barton
flat and made her comfortable until
Mr. Barton arrived Just in time for
dinner. He was surprised to find the
notÂ« from his wife, and still more sur
prised to find his aunt.
"What time did she get in?" he
asked her.
"What?" she asked.
"What time did you get in?" he Que
ried again.
"Oh, 11:45."
"And what did you do all afternoon?"
"Pardon me."
He repeated the query.
"I went to the concert."
"Did you enjoy it?" He had to ask
her three times.
"They looked nice," said Aunt Mary
Barton went out on the hack porch
to laugh. He wonders if he ever told
his wife that Aunt Mary was deaf.

ENTHUSIASM BRINGS SUCCESS
ANGELA MORGAN
ENTHUSIASM is one of the prime
essentials of success. The impor
tance of this heart and soul faculty
as a business qualification is recognised
by employers to-day as never before.
In these times of sharp competition
in the commercial world the men and
women who are counted of greatest
value by business firms are those Who
exhibit an ardent interest in the work
given them to do.
No matter how expert you are In your
chosen line, no matter how thoroughly
famJHar you may be with the details
of your occupation. If you fail to mag
netize It with your personality, you are
sure to fall short of the success you
desire.
If you would make yourself invalu
able to your employer, cultivate this
necessary quality of enthusiasm. Leflrn
to infuse vitality and interest into
whatever you are doing, even if your
vocation be not less prosaic than sell
ing neckties, fitting gloves, making
hats or soliciting for an insurance com
pany.
If you have enthusiasmâ if you can
mak* others feel that the thing you are
selling or demonstrating is a good
thing, so good that it rejoices you to
be its representative â you have the
quality most eagerly sought 4n the
business world at the present time.
The other day, in a large department
store, I watched a young woman
demonstrating soap. She did it with
such manifest joy and Interest that it
was a delight to observe her.
She was a pretty girl, but it was not
her looks attracted me so much as her
radiant manner of exhibiting the
article she was commissioned to ad
vertise. It was fascinating to witness
her happiness in detailing the merits
of the soap. She did it with all' the
ardor of a young girl displaying- her
engagement ring.
That was the beauty of it â the per
sonal delight she seemed to take in her
occupation. As I stood watching her I
marveled at her apparently inexhaust
ible enthusiasm. No matter how often
she repeated her explanation, she
seemed to lose not one bit of Joy or
buoyancy. Her last argument was still
Just as full of color as her first.
Her atmosphere of joy was contagi
ous. Her interest so positive, so vital.
that it communicated Itself to others
and roused a corresponding interest in
them.
I heard afterward that It was throueh
this radiant quality she won her pres
ent position. She had been emDloyed
at a small salary in another retail
house. It was there her present em
ployer was attracted by her ability to
interest him in an article he did not
want. She succeeded in makine the
sale, though at first he had no thought
of purchasing.
He concluded that her gift would be
of value to him in his own enterprise.
Enthusiasm can be cultivated. It is
a mistake to suppose that some per
CAT CAME BACK.
After having been imprisoned un
derground for twenty-two days, a cat
owned by Levi Poff of York Township
still lives and seems none the worse
for her experience, says the York (Pa.)
correspondent of the New York Sun.
The cat disappeared and a search by
the family failed to reveal the animal.
On the premises there is a summer
cellar which is a sort of cave walled
up, with a door at the top. Yesterday
faint cries coining up from the cellar
caused Poff to open the door. Out
crawled the cat, staggering in be
wilderment but giving no other evi
dence of having suffered from im
prisonment for almost a month. There
was not a drop of water in the cellar
nor a morsel there to eat.
The cellar had been covered with a
heavy snowdrift during most of the
period of the cat's confinement.
PTOMAINE POISON.
The term "ptomaine poison" is In
everybody's mouth, but few know what
it really is. It develops, says "What
to Eat," through the action of acid
on tin. That is why every can of meat
or vegetables or fruits should be
turned out into an earthen bowl or
crock immediately upon opening, and
that is why mayonnaise should
never be put into tin receptacles.
Only recently several women were
made seriously ill by eating salad
at a reception. Investigation showed
that the mayonnaise, in which was
considerable lemon juice, had been al
lowed to stand all day in a tin pail.
According to the physicians, enough
poison was generated to kill forty
men, and had the women eaten the
mayonnaise from the bottom of the
pail it would have been fatal to them.
HIS SPEED.
"He leads a terribly fast life.**
"Who Is he?"
"Mr. Paytheflne's chauffeur."
sons are capable of it and that others
are not. It is all a question of getting
the right attitude â mentallyâ and then
practicing dally until it becomes the
natural thing to be Interested in one's
work.
Make up your mind, to begin with,
that the work you are assigned to do
is Worthy your very best efforts. If
you are compelled to stand behind a
counter and sell merchandise instead of
standing before the footlights and en
tertaining audiencesâ as. indeed, you
may be fitted to doâ don't despise the
immediate work which is yawrs. It la
Just as necessary that charm and mag
netism should be employed in pleastnjc
customers as in pleasing audiences.
Nothing is more refreshing, more
gratifying, and more altogether de
lightful to a customer than to find a
saleswoman or salesman who really
enjoys trying to give satisfaction.
Nothing is more depressing to a cus
tomer than the colorless, don't-care at
titude of some clerks.
It never pays to be listless or Indif
ferent or ashamed of one's occupation.
The very fact that a certain work is
assigned you should give it dignity in
your eyes.
Be happy in your vocation. Love your
work and It will love you.
Enthusiasm creates enthusiasm. If
you face your customers with a wide
awake, cheerful interest, they will re
spond to your mood and give back vi
brations in kind. Thus you will add
daily to your own store of hapDv zeal.
Begin now to practice enthusiasm. You
need It if you intend to succeed.
MIRROR OF DAME FASHION
Fine chiffon broadcloths, of dull rather than a high finish, are devel
oped in charming semi-tailored effects. The bolero. In double- breasted
shape, with square chemisette, is a novelty. It is shaped with shlrrings
under the arm, and the arrangement of similar shirrings in the skirt is a
notable feature. Reseda green cloth, cream lace and bands of black lat
tice work braid are used in thin model.

ABOUT SPRING VALLEY
Assistant City Attorney Partridge
Comments Upon His Estimate of
Cost of New York System.
Rudolph Heriny, witness in the
Spring Valley case before United
State? Commissioner Heacock, was
confronted yesterday by Assistant City
Attorney Partridge with his own re
port* made to the Merchants' Asso
ciation in the city of New York while
he was actingr as a member of the en
gineering commission appointed by
the association to devise a new supply
for that city. He admitted that he
had estimated that all the work nec
essary to bring 260,000,000 gallons a
day from a distance of eighty-five
miles above New York would cost only
! about $38,000,000 and that included
jln addition the cost of a filtering
plant to filter the entire 250,000,000
â¢ gallons a day. He also admitted that
! the cost per million gallons of water
I delivered in the city of New York in
, the year 1698 was less than $25, and.
iln fact, was nearer $20. He likewise
i admitted that the company had of
i fered to supply water for New York
1 at a cost of $70 per million gallons
! and that he had stated In public that
â¢ he considered that $70 was a very cx
l cecstve amount.
The witness swore further that he
'â  was receiving a $15,000 fee from the
I Spring Valley Company as expert, all
his expenses and $50 per day for each
day he testified. The cross-examina
tion will be resumed to-day.

HANDSOME GIFT FOR CHURCH.
Throng* Munificence of Citizen Pres
byterians Will Have New Edifice.
With the approach of Eastertide
has come the good news to Presby
terians of San Francisco that the con
tracts have been signed for the erec
tion of the new St. John's Presbyteri
an Church at the corner of First ave
nue and Lake street.
The grand old church at California ;
and Octavia streets, of which the Rev. i
George G. Eldredge is pastor, will
soon be taken down, but the hand
some windows, the pulpit, the organ i
and the baptismal font will all form |
a portion of the new edifice.
The building, aside from those parts
which will be added from the old
structure, will cost $20,740. The lot
upon which the church will stand
was purchased for $10,500 and the
whole cost is estimated at $40,000.
Through the munificent gift of over
$31,000 from A. W. Foster the build
ing of the new edifice was mads pos

MARGARET ANGLJN 18 TO
PRESENT A BRIGHT PLAY
Will Appear in "The Eternal Femi
nine" at California Theater
To-Morrow Night.
Margaret Anglin will present "The
Eternal Feminine" to-morrow night
at the California Tneater. The play
was selected originally In which to
launch Miss Anglin on her stellar ca
reer.
The scenes are laid in a mythical
island, where women rule supreme
and man is only tolerated as a neces
sary domestic appendage.
Lysander and his Greek warriors
take refuge on the island during a
storm: they are made prisoners and
despite their protests are compelled
to marry with the understanding that
, the wives are to be the masters, while
I the husbands must hold humble posi
i tions. The plot gives ground for
plenty of comedy.

PIONEER BANKS
TO CLOSE TO-DAY
Nevada National and Wells-
Fargo & Company Will
Cease Business at Noon
WELL KNOWNINHISTOE V
Consolidation of Financial
Concerns Is Effected and
New One Will Open Monday
With the close of the banking hotir
to-day two of San Francisco's pioneer
financial concerns will pass out of ex
istence and Monday wilf witness thÂ»
entrance upon its career of another
hig bank'ng institution in this city.
It was announced yesterday that the
work of consolidation of the Nevada
National Bank of San Francisco and
the Wells, Fargo & Co. bank under
the name of the Wells, Fargo-Nevada
National Bank of San Francisco had
been completed and that the latter in
stitution would open its doors on Mon
<?.iy.
The passing of the Nevada National
Bark out of existence removes from
this city an institution that has fig
ured prominently in the financial af
fairs of San Francisco for thirty years.
1 During that entire period it has occu
pied its present quarters on the
ne.- of Montgomery' and Pine streets
and 't v as there that the millions in
gold taken from the Comstock min<*s
of Nevada were originally deposifed.
Formerly controlled by the bonanza
kings, Flood, Mackay, Fair an 1
O'l-rien, the bank was an important
factor in their big stock manipulations
an.l was known throughout the world
as the mining bank of the Pacific
Coast. It passed into the control of
I. W. Hellman and his associates in
IS B3 and under their management
largely became Identified as a com
mercial bank, handling all the hjg
deals beginning with the sale uf ihe
Market Street Railway to the United
Railroads a few years ago, up to the
recent Japanese bond issues.
Wells, Fargo & Co.'g bank is an
older bank than the Nevada National
and was the depository for miners all
over the coast in the early days of
minitag in this State, but although as
widely known as the other, it never
figured so prominently in the finan
cial affairs of the city and State as the
Nevada National.
The opening of the Wells, Fargo-
Nevada National Bank on Monday
will give to San Francisco the sixth
largest national bank in this country,
the larger ones being one in Chicago,
one in St. Louis and three in New
j York City.

RAINS RETARD
TROUT FISHING
Give Angling With the Fly
a Setback, 1 but Do Not
Spoil Sport With Bait
The rains of the past week have given
the anglers who are devotees of fly
fishing another setback, as the streams
are higher than they were and the time
when the trout will take the fly has
been put farther away. The rain will
have but little effect on the bati fish
ing, which is reported good at present.
One effect of the late rains will be to
freshen up the streams and to help th_
last run of small fish, which usually
come in from the ocean about this time.
In a dry year they cannot get far up
the stream, but this year they can do
so. This should make the late fishing:
good.
The nearby streams still attract a
large number of anglers, but this is
only the skirmish line of the army
which will be afield later on, when the
sport begins on the rivers and moun
tain lakes. The first of the great fly
fishing will be engaged in the Big
Meadows at the headwaters of the
Feather River. About the same time
the McCloud will be available, then the
upper Sacramento, and finally the
Truckee. Flyfishing on the latter
stream is seldom good before July.
Many of the men out now believe "It
is not all of fishing to catch fish."
They are repaid by the pleasure of bo
ing on the stream under the blue skie6.
The sight of the wild flowers" in their
profusion and the general fr^sjpness of
the country are alone sufficient to at
tract the lover of nature ouAof doors.
The Paper Mill, although wnfpped by
many men, continues to yield good
catr-hes to those who know Its peculiar
ities. Some large fish have been taken
at Point Reyes. Four steelheads landed
there ranged from 2Vfc pounds to 6
pounds.
Quite a number of fish from 6 to 10
inches in length have been taken there
on the fly. To secure a good catch the
fisherman must know all the conditions
of the water. He must also know how
and where to cast.
Dr. Henry Van Dyke, the noted au
thor, will return to Princeton with a
high opinion of California anglers and
of California angling. As the guest of
Charles S. Wheeler at the latter's
country home on the McCloud he had
the unalloyed pleasure of landing a
seven-pound Dolly Varden. These flsh
put up a stubborn fight like that of
the bulldog. Others of the trout fam
ily fight for their lives near the sur
face, but the Dolly Varden usually
seek the depths and it requires great
skill %> bring them to the landing net.
The Dolly Varden preys on the small
er trout and when a full-grown one is
taken the fisherman usually says,
"That means another 60,000 rainbow
trout saved."
Many fish are being taken on the
McCloud with bait at the present time.
William Halstedt and some friends
fished the San Lorenzo near Santa
Cruz recently- and had good sport.
W. W. Richards will soon be on his
favorite streams in Santa Cruz County.
He knows this territory thoroughly.
Al Cumming and party left last night
for the Klamath. This is the first of
his angling pilgrimages of the reason.
Louis Boutellier fished Kidd Cr<?ek.
near Cazade^o, some days since and
secured a limit basket.
Although the upper Sacramento Is
high the small streams which empty
into it are yielding good returns. The
anglers who live near Sissons are en
joying good sport in the meadows ntetfr
the, head waters of the Sacramento. .
Favorable reports have been received
here from the Garcia River in Men
docino County and also, from the Big
and Little rivers. .
Striped bass fishing was good at San
Pablo until the recent rain. A party
of anglers went up from this city last
Sunday, but got no returns. The muddy
streams emptying into the bay are held
responsible for the absence of flsh. â¢
Many fish are being taken from the
PurisÃima in San Mateo, but they are
of small size. The six-inch fish are
plump and weigh more than fish of the
same length taken elsewhere.

COURSERS MEET
ON TWO FIELDS
Greyhounds Will Compete at
Union Park and Also on
the Ingleside Grounds
There will be coursing at Union Park
and at Ingleside to-morrow, although
the scarcity of hares is still a problem
which the promoters find it difficult to
solve. For this reason the entries are
limited to the best dogs.
The Union Park management is hold
ing off the Grand National champion
ship stake, waiting for conditions to
change. The Ladies' Day champion
stake is . run usually about this time,
but that has also to be postponed. It
is hoped that hares can be secured in
numbers next month. If the situation
is relieved there will be two days'
coursing, each week.
There are a. number of puppies the
owners of which are awaiting a chance
to show them in competition. What
this season's youngsters may lack in
numbers they make up in quality, all
being of the finest breeding.
Jack Dennis has added the fast young
dog Humboldt to his kennel.
The likely winners at Union Park to
morrow are:

MOTOR CAR OPKRATORS
MUST HAVE LICENSES
New State Law Classifies Owners Who
Run Their Own Cars as
"Mechanics."'
After to-day no one, whether owner
or chauffeur, will be permitted to op
erate a motor car on any highway or
public road in the State unless he is
duly registered in accordance with the
provisions of the law regulating the
ownership and use of automobiles.
A supply of blanks for the registra
tion of motor vehicles and of chauf
feurs has been received from the Sec
retary of State and members of the
Automobile Club of California may
obtain them by application to A. J.
Frey, the secretary, at the offices of
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company-
There has been some discussion as to
whether an owner who operates his
motor car is required to register as
chauffeur or not. The owner of a car,
when operating it himself, is a "me
chanic" within the meaning of the
law and must be registered as a
chauffeur.
The law even goes further than this.
If the wife, son or daughter of an
owner who is duly registered as the
law requires desires to operate the
motor car he or she must take out a
license as a chauffeur.
The membership roll of the Auto
mobile Club of California now has
about 400 names of people in all parts
of the State, the number of members
having been all but doubled since the
Ist of January of this year. It is ex
pected this will be an active season
among the automobilists of California.
The Supervisors of Santa Cruz Coun
ty have already declared the mountain
road open, saying that if the State
law is constitutional the road would
be open without any action on their
part as soon as the law becomes op
erative.
The first run of the Automobile Club
during the present season will take
place next Saturday and Sunday, the
29th aird 30th inst.. to San Jose, those
who take part reaching the rendez
vous at the Hotel Vendome by the
route and at the time they prefer. In
the evening an entertainment, the de
tails of which are being arranged, will
be given. Sunday morning will be oc
cupied by trips around San Jose and
in the afternoon the automobilists
will return home. L. P. Lowe, chair
man of the executive committee, haa
prepared a circular showing the rates
and accommodations at the hotel and
will reply to questions that may be
asked in regard to the run.
CITY ATTORNEY DECLINES.â City At
torney Lone yetterday nottfled the Board of
Works that be would not attend to the legal
business of the board except In cases wherein
the city Is made defendant for any official
actÂ« of the board. As moÂ»tof-the-Â»ults against

TENNIS CRACKS
AFTER HONORS
Championship of San Fran
cisco County Brings Out
the Keenest of Bivalry
The next tennis event of importance
will be the annual event for the cham
pionship of San Francisco. It will be
played as usual on May 30 at the Cali
fornia Club. This will be the first
championship eve"nt of the year
each and every tennis crack in the â  ity
is anxious to win the title. J. D.
Gavin, the present champion, will not
defend. Unless Percy Murdock de
cides to play the championship will
probably go to George Baker.
The latter is a trifle stronger than
any of the other players arid will be
in little danger of losing unless some
body like Murdock decides to enter.
The others who would have a chance
against Baker are George Janes, Her
bert Long, Charles Foley. Clarence
Griffin, Harry Rolfe, Neil Baker, Her
bert Schmidt and Carl Gardner.
The Academic Athletic League ten
nis tournaments are scheduled for the
29th inst. and for May 13. The singles
will be played a week from next Sat
urday and the doubles two weeks
later. Some of the schools are anx
ious to hold the doubles across the
bay, but the players from this city
are opposed to this plan. As most of
the school represented are in this
the doubles, as well as the single?
probably be played, as in the past,
on the California Club courts.
There will be an unusual number of
high-class players in both events thia
year. Judging from the entry list on
this side or the bay. Lowell High
School will be represented by Herberr
Long and Melville Long in doubles and
by the former in singles. Lick win
have Marius Hotchkiss and Harol .
briel in doubles and one or the other
in singles, probably Hotchkiss. Poly
technic- will also have â  strong repre
sentative in singles. It will pin its
faith to Charles Foley. The Utter is
one of the cleverest players at th>s
park. That the singles championship
will go to either him or Herbert Long
is almost a certainty, la doubles Poly,
technie will not be so strong. Foley
will have rather a weak partner. Tlv*
doubles championship will in ill prob
ability go to either the Long brothers
or Gabriel and Hotchkiss.
The players from across the bay
have not been heard from, but it is*
safe to say none will turn up that
Foley and Long need fear much.
Although active players are more
numerous in the California Club than
ever before, there seems to be less in
terest in tournaments than formerly.
Especially is this t*o among the so
called first class and second clasa
players. Both of these classes are com
paratively small and the player? show
little or no inclination to try conclu
sions with one another.
A state of affairs entirely different
exists in the third and fourth classes.
These sections are both large and
rivalry is keen among the lower class
men. The players are evenly matched
and go into a tournament with a de
termination to win if possible.
Arrangements are under way for a
tournament to settle the grammar
school championship. A cup has been
donated and the first annual tourna
ment will be played probably during
the month of May. Many of the boya
in the Junior Club go to grammar
school and they are anxious to settle
the question of supremacy among
them.
Two tournaments will be completed
to-day and to-morrow. This morn
ing on the park courts Misa Lulu
Wegener and Mrs. Watson (owe
15 1-6) and Miss Weed and Miss Van
Vliet (1-6) will meet in the finals of
the handicap double tournament for
the Olds cups.
The finals of the third and fourth
classes will be played on the California
Club courts to-morrow. In the third
class Moulten Warner and George Cut
ler will oppose each other. Daniel
Volkmann and Ed Bacon will meet in
the fourth class.

COFFROTH SEEKS
A CONFERENCE
Manager Jim Coffroth will announce
to-night at 6 o'clock the status of the
proposed Britt-White fight. He has
asked Charley Mitchell, representing
White, to meet Britt and himself at
Harry Corbett'g at that hour when he
will divulge his plans. He has proved
a game fighter against tremendous
odds and is not willing to acknowledge
defeat.
When it seemed he had won Super
visor Bent over to his side it was be
lieved he had carried the day. Bent
would not change his stand, however,
so it seems impossible for Coffroth to
promote the fight this month.
He has been advised by men well
versed in the law that he could defeat
the present boxing ordinance in the
courts. The Supervisors make it a
crime to do what the Legislature al
lows. The State law covers all points
regarding prize fighting, but does not
require that a permit be secured. The
law allows "domestic incorporated
clubs" to promote boxing. There is
no mention of "athletic clubs." The
word "athletic" was eliminated by the
Legislature in 1903, the amendment
being introduced by Walsh of Ala
meda.
Coffroth was closely associated with
courts for fifteen years ane" haa no de
sire to meddle with the law, so he will
hardly fight in that direction.
If he tries for a permit during the
next two months he will probably have
the same opposition of the politicians,
together with that of the other club
managers, who claim the right to pro
mote fights in those months.
With all these conditions against him
his chances of carrying out his con
pact with the boxers seem small.
White ig said to have been guaranteed
$2FjOO win, lose or draw. Whether
this will be forthcoming if the fight is
abandoned is a question. Morris Levy
would like to put White against Han
lon next month. If he could defeat
Hanlon handily he would then be in
line to fight the lightweights.
Battling Nelson has accepted an
offer of $3000 for two fights to take
place before Philadelphia clubs about
the middle of next month. His oppo
nents will be selected from boys who
are familiar with the six-round game.
Nelson may also fight Jack Clifford
at Grass Valley, a liberal offer having
been made for such a fight.
Rufe Turner of Stockton has been
challenging Kelson. Manager Nolan
has made the following offer on behalf
of his protege: "Nelson will sign ar
ticles to fight Turner at once if the
latter will post a Hide bet of $2500.
We will not give him the chance to
pick up a big losers end of a purse."
JOKERS DRIVE
YOUTH INSANE
Special Dlceatch to The Call.
LEWISTON, Idaho, April 21.â Ray
W. Nannes, the Indiana young man
who was recently the victim of a mock
hold-up at Lake Waha, has lost his
mind as a result of the joke. He was
taken to the Blackfoot Insane Asylum
.. Nannes is in a pitiful condi
tion. His mind is a total blank as to
his past life. He has no recollection of
the hold-up, neither does he recognize
his friends who have called at the
County Jail to visit him.
Hi? commitment to the asylum is the
climax of the sensational disclosures
made in a damage suit brought by his
attorneys for $10,000 against the Jokers,
who are well known residents of the
Waha country.

Commuters' Second Baseman
Brings Lone Run Home in
Tenth Inning.
Grahnin and Henley Use
Curves That Make Stars
Look Like Buskers.
Uncle is beginning to ride swiftly on
the old baseball .toboggan. He is go
ing down the line fast now, and if the
pace keeps up he will be in the second
division soon. At Recreation Park yes
terday the Commuters beat him to the
finish for the third time running. It
was a hot old battle, lasting ten in
ning?, and the final score was as close
as it could possibly be. Score: San
Francisco 0, Ookland 1.
Kelly again managed to sustain the
name that is immortal ott the baseball
diamond. His timely old hit in the
tenth spasm broke up the game once
more. This makes three without a miss
that Kelly has brought home to Uncle
Rip, and for tnrs reason he is in the
idol class and stands right with every
fan who has seen him perform this
week.
"Silver" Henley gave another exhibi
tion of how to pitch baseball without
letting in runs. He was there for nine
rounds and came pretty near getting:
away with the tenth one. The busher
had everything, including perfect con
trol. Graham let the Seals down with
two hits and after the fourth inning
had great command of the ball. It was
useless for Uncle's stickers to swine,
for they could hit nothing.
Although the field was wet and sliD
pery, the fielders managed to grab al
most everything that came alone.
Francks played a wonderful game at
short, and so did Gochnauer. Little
McMurry. for Oakland, pegged in per
fect style to the second sack, and not a
Seal could get away with a stolen base,
though several of them tried.
The only run was scored by Krueer
in the tenth inning, when he singled
over second and promptly stole. Dun
leavy dumped one at Henley, who lugr
gled the ball for a fraction of a sec
ond and thereby was too late to catch
Kruger at third. Streib went out to
Murphy, but Kelly swung through
with a drive to right field and scored
Kruger. Dunleavy did a runabout act
between third and home and managed
to avoid Wilson, Henley and Irwin as
they chased him along the lines. The

STATE ATTORNEY HEALY
AFTER THE RACING MEN
Declares He Will Not Allow the Wash-
ington Park Track Officials to
Run the American Derby.
CHICAGO, April 21.â Derby day is to
come in for State Attorney Healy's at
tention when he starts his anti-race
track crusade, unless Mayor Dunne
previously announces he will close
Washington Park track. Healy to-day
reiterau-d his declaration that he would
ferret out the gamblers and prosecute
them, declaring he does not accept the
old argument that Derby day is the
wealthy mans pleasure day and that it
shoujd not be molested.
Mayor Dunne was asked about Wash
ington Park track to-day and said he
had received official notification the
track was to open. When told Healy
would proceed against the track unless
he did, the Mayor said: "Mr. Healy
knows his own business."
Lawrence A. Young, president of
Washington Park Club, refused to
make any comment upon State Attor
ney Healy's plans.
"Ed" Wagner, one of the owners of
"Worth" track, which meeting opens a
week from Saturday, also refused to
comment on the question. "We expect
to open on the date announced," he
said.
Weller to Captain Stanford Team.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April
21. â M. J. Weller, better known to'
college sportsmen as "Sunny Jim Wel
ler," was elected captain of the Stan
ford track team to-day to pilot its
fortunes through the season of 1906.
Weller is one of the best performers
on the cinder path, making the car
dinal team as a freshman and winning
seven points in the intercollegiate
meet with the University of California.
He is a broad jumper and a hurdler.
The prospects for the Stanford trVck
team for next season seem p rosy.
Hurdler Lanagan, Whitaker, the pole
vaulter, and Crawford, the hammer
thrower, are the only men whom the
cardinal will lose. With the addition
of the freshmen who have expressed
their intention of coming to Stanford
Captain Weller thinks his team will
surely come out ahead in the next in
tercollegiate meet with the blue and
gold.
Trnpshooters Go South.
A number of well known trapshots,
including Holling, Reed, King and
Hoyt, have gone from this city to Los
Angeles, where they will compete in
a bluerock shoot to-day and to-mor
row. From there they will go to
Santa Ana, where another two-day
meet will be hÂ«ld.
The old time shoot of the Lincoln
Oun Club will be held to-morrow on
the Ingleside grounds. The various
events will be held under novel con
ditions and a large gathering of trap
shootera is expected.

Giants Out.
Bernard's Two-Bagger Fol
lowed by Smith's Single
Tells Talc of Defeat.
PORTLAND, April 21.â Ten innings
were necessary for the defeat of the
Giants to-day. The Loo Loos won by
the score of 3 to 2. They might have
been scoring yet had they not been shut
off by a neat double play. The Giants
opened up by hitting Dolly Gray hard.
They made four hits in the first, which,
together with a weird double heave
gave them two runs as an appetizer.
Van Buren singled, McCreedie failed
to sacrifice him, but Van went to sec
ond on his out. Schlafley. flew to
Cravath. Householder put one past
Cravath and in the tangle reached
third. Then the next move Toman
threw the ball so it hit Householder's
shoulder and rolled off a mile and
Kddie fell on the hearthstone. In the
tenth, McCreedie, Schlafley and House
holder all went out and Los Angeles
won by Bernard's two-bagger and his
homecoming on Smith's single.

FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Cruzados, the star of the .Baldwin
stable, carrying "Handriding" Kelly
and 122 pounds, captured the six fur
long handicap from rather a sprightly
field of sprinters yesterday at Oakland.
Cruzados ran coupled with Ameri
cano, a younger brother, the entry
ruling a 4 to 5 choice. Sad Sam, quite
a finished mudlark by the way. out
broke the others at the start and tried
to make a runaway race of it. Before
three furlongs had been traversed
Cruzados passed him, and while the
Texas halfbreed displayed unusual
gamenoss, the favorite led him across
the line a handy winner by more
than a length in 1:15. Tocolaw. after
meeting with some Interference on the
back stretch, ran a bang-up third.
It seemed Collector Jessup might
cut a figure at one stage of the race,
then his light flickered and went out.
Nigretto pulled up lame, which ac
counts for the poor showing made by
the mare.
THREE FAVORITES SCORE.
The first three favorites went by the
board, after which better luck attend
ed the efforts of the remaining three.
The track was muddy, making fast
time an impossibility.
One hundred and eighteen pounds
to negotiate didn't appear to bother
I'm Joe any more than if it were a
sack of feathers to carry in the two
year-old scramble. He looked a hot
bird ready to match a cold bottle and
at odds of 5 to 1 breezed home ahead
of Syphon Girl, the favprite. Tooman
succeeded in getting srfway last with
Lady King, thereby fooling a vast
concourse of people.
Strangely enough the price, climatic
conditions, track and everything else
pertaining to the game suited C. Mil
ler, the astute pilot of Serenity, and
he let the mare down in the six-fur
lojoe selling sprint at odds of 20 to 1.
Wilier has been accused of being timid,
but that must be a nursery rhyme.
Yesterday the Dayton & Kahn rider
would have attempted a head-stand on
a buzz saw. He turned Eldred around
on the stretch turn, and. slipping
through a crevice two Inches in width,
won easily at the wire from Dr. Sher
man and Dorice. Dan Collins. the
favorite, foundered at sea, and all
hands were lost.
GLOOMY GFS BRIGHTENS IT*.
Possibiy the new owner of Gloomy
Gus has resorted to the use of Sapoilo
in liberal doses, for Gloomy has bright
ened \UP wonderfully since changing
hands. A winner on the preceding
day at odds of 25 and 30 to 1. the rinsr
laid 12 about him in the betting on tha
third race, and he downed Calculate a
neck. McClees piloted the winner.
Baker, the favorite, ran unplaced.
Dan Lamasney at last took a purse
with Allopath. The mare went to the
post an 8 to 5 favorite for the first
mile and a furlong selling number and
defeated J. V. Klrby with apparent
ease. Bozcman finished third with
Henry Clay Rye.
T^edus, favorite for the split of the
mile and a furlong, found the road a
bit more rocky, although he scored.
Marelio, a 15 to 1 shot, assumed thÂ»i
leading position on the far turn, and
Graham, astride the first choice. Just
got up in time to receive a head de
cision. "Cricket" Kelly landed May
Jlolladay in third place.

CONVENT FIRE
COSTS 14 LIVES
MONTREAL, April 22. â The little
village of St. Genevieve la in mourn
ing to-night over the loss of fourteen
lives in a fire which destroyed the Con
vent of St_ Anne there early to-day.
One nun, nine children ranging in age
from 10 to 19 years and four aged
women perished in the flames. Two
nuns were so severely burned that it is
feared they will die. In their grief,
over the catastrophe the villagers find
some comfort in relating the heroism
displayed by Sister Maria Adjuteur,
who grave up her life, and Sister Marie
Therese and Sister Marie Robertine.
who were fatally burned in their ef
forts to save the lives of the children
and helpless old women in their
charge.
The dead:
SISTER MARIE ADJUTEUR, mualc
mistress, aged 32 years.

Injured: Sister Marie Therese. Sister
Marie Robertine, both probably fa
tally.
Sister Adiuteur, in her efforts to
save the lives of the children in her
charge, succumbed to the smoke and
flames. The pupils who perished were
â¢ in a portion of the building where the
fire had obtained too much headway
before the alarm was given to enable
te who responded to effect their
: rescue.
I The fire started about midnight in
I the old ladies" hospice and the smoke
j was so thick that the children on the
| floor above were unable to get down.
The convent was called St. Anne
âºwas a branch of the Convent of the
I Sisters Of St. Anne's of Lachine. The
I building was a gray stone structure.
I handsome In appearance, massive in
J character, and with the church it
I formed a central figure of the pretty
litUe village.
The parents of Miss Bertha Tessier,
one of the victims, are In California.

LABOR UNIONS
MAKE PROTEST
Attitude Is Strong Against
Employment 'of Japanese
to Dig the Panama Canal
APPEAL TO PEESIDENT
The employment of Japanese for the
construction of the Panama canal is
meeting with strong: protest from 'the
labor unions of San Francisco. Last
night two of the leading organizations
of the city took formal action to make
known their attitude.
The San Francisco Labor Council
adopted the following resolutions:
Whereas. The Isthmian Canal Commission
is about to conclude or has already concluded
contracts for the employment of Japanese
laborers on the Manama canal; and
Whereas. The employment of Asiatic labor
ers to the exclusion oi white or colored labor
ers of American origin would be a confession
to the world that this continent is unable
to furnish labor that in skill, endurance and
ability t'j combat adverse conditions to suc
Â«ebbiully carry on the construction of its great
public works, which we emphatically deny;
and
Whereas, Such a course would not only
commit our Government to the fatal and short
sighted policy of choosing the cheapest and
most servile labor available, but would also
ba a violation of the spirit, if not the letter,
ot the alien contract labor laws and possibly
In violation of the thirteenth amendment of
the constitution of the United States; and
Whereas. No real difficulties need arise in
procuring the ten or twenty thousand men
necessary, from either the acclimated inhab
itants of tropical America or from the hun
dreds of thousands of our own unemployed,
who. if cared for with but half the solicitude
shown our naval and military torcÂ«s in the
trorlcs. would, we can safely assert, meet
all reasonable requirements as to efficiency,
endurance and supply; and
Whereas, The construction of this canal, the
greatest undertaking in the history of our
country. Is to be paid for by millions of dol
lam ot American money, appropriated by tht
American Congress, and was designed for the
benefit of American's first of all; therefore be it
Resolved, That we enter our earnest and
emphatic protest against this flagrant attempt
to wrest trom American laborers and citizens
their natural and civil rights to do the work
of this nation exclusively and under Govern
mental protection from debasing competition
with servile and alien Asiatic labor that, once
having gained a foothold on the Isthmus, la
bound to establish upon the American conti
nent a plague spot which will spread out and
in time affect our entire civlzation:
Resolved. That we urge upon our Govern
ment its paramount duty to favor American
labor at ail hazards, and not to forego this or
any other opportunity for the utilization of
American skill and toil to promote the well
being, the oontentment and prestige of the
American people; further
Resolved, That we urge and request the im
mediate canceling of any and all contracts
made or Intended to be made for the employ
ment of Asiatic laborers on the isthmian
canal: end be it further
Resolved, That conies of these resolutions
be sent to the President, the Secretaries of
the Departments of State. Wax. Labor and
Commerce, the Attorney General, the Isthmian
Canal Commission, central bodies of labor or
ganizations throughout the United States and
to the press; and be it further
Resolved. That a telegraphic dispatch be
sent to the President of the United States as
follows: "To the President: The San Fran
cisco Labor Council emphatically protests
against the employment of Japanese and
Asiatic laborers on the Panama canal, and
earnestly requests you to have all contracts
for the same canceled."
The following resolutions were
passed by the City Front Federation:
Whereas, The Isthmian Canal Commission
Is at present making arrangements for the
importation of thousands of Asiatics to be em
ployed in constructing the Panama canal; and.
Whereas, Experience has proved that where
the Asiatic race, especially Japanese, have con
gregated In numbers they have driven out the
white population; and.
Whereas. The Importation of Asiatics to
perform labor under contract or agreement in
the United States or her possessions is a direct
violation of the alient contract labor laws; be it
Resolved. By the City Front Federation, in
regular meeting assembled April 19. 1905, that
we are moat emphatically opposed to the em
ployment of Asiatics on the construction of the
canal as being inimical to the best Interests of
the Amtrlcan people and a danger arM menace
to our country: further
Resolved. That we are opposed to the Gov
ernment of the United States contracting for
foreign labor in violation of the law; further
Resolved, T!iat a copy of these resolutions
be forwarded to the President, his Cabinet and
the Canal Commissioners, and that a copy be
given to the press.

The report of Edward A. Beale. Section Di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
Oreron Crop Bulletin, week ended April 18,
1* as follows:
The first half of the week was. dry. with
frosty nights and warm afternoons. The laÂ»t
half was showery, and good rains fell In all
sections of the State. The eotl is now in ex
cellent condition â¢ for plowing and germination
cf seeds, and farming operations have made
rapid progress during the past week
The stand of fall wheat is rood; the plant
Is healthy and Its growth during the week has
'been satisfactory. Spring wheat seeding Is
Tvell advanced and In many sections . completed.
The early sown came up nicely and m cora-
I lainte Â«re made in any locality regarding Its
condition. Barley and oats are also doing well.
Pasturage is much better than usual at this
**ason of theÂ«.-ear, and all grasses and forage
plants are thrifty and promising.- Lambing is
well -advanafd sad the loss*? have been small.
Goat shearrhg Is finished and the mohair clip
1? above the average, both in quality and
quantity.
Barly gardens are up and good progress ha*
bpen made in planting late gardens. Consider
able .iand ha* been prepared for corn, and in
the southern sections some corn has been
planted. Early potatoes are dbing well, except :
In a few exposed -places, where they were ln
lured by froeu Hope are thrifty and promis
ing. - . - - r
lt<f frosts have undoubtedly done consider- I
able harm to fruit, but to what extent cor- ]
respondents disagree. Some -think- only a
reasonable amount of thinning has occurred ;
and that the fruit crop will be better In con- '
â¢Â«suÂ«ice thereof, while others claim that '
Italian prunes, peaches, pears, cherries and I
plums have been seriously harmed. Apples
and French prunes have received but little
Injury. Some varieties of apples have not 1
fciooraed co fall as usual, but the condition â¢of
apples is -generally promising.

a total of 392 boxes being received yesterday.
Prices were lower under these increased sup
plies and poorly colored lots, particularly of
the ordinary White variety, were slow of sale
at the inside quotations. Strawberries, too,
were in increased supply, the receipts being
353 chests, but prices were well maintained
and attractive lots cleaned up readily at or
near the^outside rates. The Orange market
ruled firm under continued light receipts and
a brisk demand, and prices of the choice and
fancy grades of Navels had another arlvan'-c.
The auction sale drew a large attendance "and
the bidding was spirited, with small sizM
fruit keenly competed for. A straight carload
of fancy Mediterranean Sweets was offered
and brought $1 40, and five cars of Navels
were told as follows: Fancy, $1 4(V?H ".".;

HEYWOOD WILL
NOW ATTACKED
Stepdaughter Makes Move
That May Give Her Entire
Estate of the Capitalist
SAYS TKUST IS INVALID
Attorney Contends That It
Falls Under Decisions
Beached in Noted Cases
The controversy over the valuable
estate of Franklin Heywood assumed
a new aspect yesterday, when a peti
tion was filed by his adopted daughter,
Agnes Maud Heywood, which calls on
Judge Kerrigan to pass upon the
validity of the trust clause in de
cedent's will. The petition filed yester
day is another complication in the
estate, which at present involves an
interesting contest between the widow
and the daughter tor the valuable
home left by decedent at 1490 Hayes
street. The petition of the daughter
filed yesterday questions the validity
of the trust declared in her father's
I will and specifies with great particu
larity the reasons for its invalidity un
der the law of the State.
It appears from the statement of the
daughter's attorney, Timothy J. Lyons,
that the trust in the will is an exact
counterpart of the trust which was
declared void by the Supreme Court
in the estate of James Q. Fair, and is
within the rulings laid down by that
court in many subsequent cases, among
others the cases of estate of Sanford
and Carpenter against Cook, and the
estate of Willey. It is said, also, that
the Heywood caae involves many of
the features urged before Judge Cof
fey as to the invalidity of the trust
of the Clunie building in the estate of
Thomas J. Clunie,
If the daughter of Franklin Heywood
should prevail under the petition Jnst
filed by her she will come into the pos
session of the entire estate left by her
father, which is said in her application
to be worth $220,000.
Judge Kerrigan fixed "Wednesday,
May 3, for the hearing of the petition.
An interesting story lies behind this
petition, which will come out before
Judge Kerrigan at the hearing before
him next week in the contest between
the daughter, the widow and the other
relatlevs who are opposing bath of
them. Attorney Lyons, for the daugh
ter, has twice argued before Judge Ker
rigan that the attorne> for the exec
utors and the trustees, EL A. Powell,
has so acted in the interests of the
collateral relatives mentioned in the
will as to put the daughter in the ap
parent position of having lost her
rights to a homestead. It is the con
tention, however, that she has not lost
these rights, and an interesting story,
it is said, will be told in court relative
to the manner in which she came to
be placed in the position in which she
now finds herself.

JAPANESE MAID
FIGHTS PERSCH
Mlbb I. Yamamoto, a pretty Japanese
girl sixteen years old, played havoc
yesterday morning in Wakelee's drug
store In the Occidental Hotel build
ing. She had taken refuge In the drug
More to escape the clutches of H. A.
S. Persch, a handsome young immi
grant officer who had placed her under
arrest for deportation.
Miss Yamamoto arrived by the
steamship Korea with her mistress,
Mrs. J. Chapman, a missionary, but
was denied a landing by the medical
authorities because they found that
she was suffering from trachoma. She
managed, however, to elude the vigi
lance of the watchman and joined
her mistress at the Occidental Hotel.
United Btates Immigrant Inspector
Persch was sent to the hotel and ar
rested her, but when she got out
side she ran into the drug store
in an effort to escape. She caught
hold of a lady's dress, implor
ing her to save her from "dat bad
man." Persch was in pursuit of the
Oriental beauty and she ran behind the
counter. After a catch-as-catch-can
wrestling match he succeeded in drag
ging her to the door, breaking sev
eral bottles of toilet water on the way.
The maiden a second time tore away
from his official embrace and again
took refuge behind the counter. Then
Persch, fearful of demolishing the
drug store, telephoned for assistance,
and Chinese Watchman Blackburn and
Inspector de la Torre came to the res
cue.
'In the meantime the girl's father,
who keeps a store at 530 Dupont street,
arrived and took a hand in the game
by attempting, to Jiu jitsu Persch. But
Watchman Blackburn, a man of one
time athletic renown, banged him
prone upon the pavement and sat upon
his chest, while Persch and de la Torre
drag]?ed the unwilling maid to the de
tention shed on the mail dock to be de
ported by the next steamer.

POLICE SEARCH
FOR EX-CONVICT
The police are satisfied that the bur
glar who has been operating in the
Western Addition is Frank Beal. an
ex-convict. They have arrived at this
belief from the description given by
Arthur J. Falvey of the burglar, who
entered his residence, 465 McAllister
street, shortly after the noon hour on
Thursday and stole $310 worth of Jew
elry. The description of the burerlar
tallies exactly with that of Beal re
corded at the identification bureau at
police headquarters.
Beal has always been known as a
daylight burglar. He has served three
terms for burglary. The first was six
years in Folsom for burglary in Ala
meda County in 1887; the second, seven
and a half years in Folsom on three
charges of burglary in this city in 1891.
and the third, eight years in San Quen
tin for burglary in this city In 1898. He
was only recently discharged.
Captain Burnett has instructed his
staff of detectives to bend every energy
to capture Beal, and accurate descrip
tions of him have been sent to the dif
ferent police stations by Chief Dlnan
with similar instructions to the Datrol
men.
The police believe Bear was the bur
glar who entered the residence of Rob
ert Tibbitts at 541 Steiner street on Sun
day morning, between 10 and 12 o'clock,
and stole about $5000 worth of iewelry.
They are equally positive that he is the
crook who has been visiting apartment
houses in the Western Addition and
opening the doors of rooms by means
of a skeleton key. Several burglaries
of this description have been reported
to the police within the last two weeks,
the latest one being on Wednesday last
at 1201 O'Farrell street.

Auditor Baehr yesterday filed with
the Board of Supervisors his annual es
timate of the revenues and expendi
tures of the municipality for the fiscal
year 1905-6. Baehr recommends a tax
rate of SI 07 on every $100 (including
seven cents for parks) on a basis of
an assessed valuation of $510,000,000,
subdivided as follows:

The following communication from
Baehr accompanies the estimate:
The city's steady Increase In population is
manifest in thÂ« amounts needed for new im
provements In street work, additions to school
houses, hospitals, Jails, etc., which neces
sarily reaulres a heavier expense in providing
for maintenance, supplies ana proner police
*nd fire protection for lives and property; and
It follows that an increased expenditure Is
required in nearly every branch of the gov
ernment.
-I have recommended an increase of about
100 officers for the Police Department. In
suggesting^ an increase of officers in this rie
partment, I am actuated by a desire to have
the city proiperly protected from the Invasion
of the criminal classes. ThÂ« Chinese and the
Latin uuarter (where crime is rampant) and
the outside districts should be properly po
liced and the homes and lives of law abiding
citizens protected.
FOR FIRE PROTECTION.
I have carefully considered the wants of the
Fire Department and submit to you an ln
ereÂ«6G for the regular running expenses there
of. New companies should be organized in
the rapidly growing districts from Ashbury
Heights to the ocean; also the Richmond Dis
trict, the Potrero and South San Francisco, as
the companies located in these territories are
iradefjuate to cope with thÂ« common enemy.
In the' natter of th*> appropriation to\main
tain thÂ« School Department. I have been as
liberal as the law will permit, taking Into
consideration the estimated amount of the
assessment roH. and having In view the fact
that several new classes will be added to our
rchools which will necessitate additional teach
ers. I have therefore recommended an increase
of $37,500 for salaries.
Several departments have asked for in
crease* of the salaries for their subordinates,
without giving any sufficient reason therefor.
As the charter Is very explicit In the matter of
salaries, wages, etc., I most respectfully de
cline to recommend these additional expenses.
The following recommendations for nfw
improvements, other than those which I have
specified above In detail, are submitted: Elec
tric system for municipal buildings, $7200;
new fire alarm system in the School Depart
ment. $15,000; new engine houses and equip
ments, $50,000; purchase of right-of-way, $2.V

fitting up offices, $25,000; repaying streets and
reconstruction of county roads, $100,000; re

$40,000.

OELRICHS WINS
MOOTED POINT
Hebbard Decides Capitalist
Need Not Testify Against
Wife in the Seymour Case
APPEAL WILL BE TAKEN
Counsel Contends Action at
Bar Does Not Involve the
Principle Court Upholds
Judge Hebbard decided yesterday
th^t Hermann Oelrichs is absolved
under the law from testifying against
his wife, Theresa A. Oelrichs, in the
suit instituted against her and Virginia
Vanderbilt by John A. Seymour, former
captain of detectives, to recover $26,000
for breach of contract. . Seymour al
leges that he was employed by the
late Charles A. Fair, Mrs. Oelrichs and
Mrs. Vanderbilt as agent of thir es
tate in this city at a salary of $350 a
month for a period of ten years. After
the death of Charles Fair, however, he
was dismissed from his position, but
alleges that there is due and unpaid
him under his contract the sum sued
for.
Hermann Oelrichs was summoned to
give his deposition before a notary,
but under instructions of his counsel
he refused to testify on the ground
that his relations with Mrs. Oelrlchs
were confidential and he could not be
compelled to give evidence that might
Injure her case. Attorney P. F. Dunne,
Seymour's counsel, took the point to
Judge Hebbard for decision and after,
argument yesterday the court sus
tained Oelrichs in his refusal to tes
tify.
An appeal will be taken to the Su
preme Court by Seymour, whose coun
sel contends that though as a general
principal of law a husband cannot be
compelled to testify against his wife,

FUNSTON WILL
BAR PICNICKERS
The United States tvÂ« McDowell is
no longer to be used as a picnic boat.
Hereafter she will be used solely for
the purpose for which she was intend
ed. Such is the edict that has come
forth from the department headquar
ters in a circular issued yesterday.
The McDowell was originally in
tended to carry officers and troops of
the United States army and their fami
lies to and from the different posts
about the bay. Intimate friends of
the army people were also supposed
to enjoy the privilege of going on the
boat to visit the different stations.
But the privilege has been very much
abused of late and it became too com
mon a practice to organize junketing
parties for the run of the little vessel
around the bay.
Hereafter permits for transporta
tion will be issued only by Lieutenant
Burton J. Mitchell, aid to General
: Funston, the commander of the de
partment. Heretofore the McDowell
has been so crowded, especially on
Sundays, that officers and their wives
have been so inconvenienced by the
rush and right for seats that they had
practically abandoned any attempt to
come to town on that day. Forty and
' fifty people have been in the habit of
asking the department headquarters
for.passes on the boat, giving all kinds
and sorts of reasons for making the
: trip. All that is now abolished.
General Samuel S. Sumner, the new
i ly appointed commander of the Divi
sion of the Pacific, is expected daily
to arrive here. Reports came yester
day that he had been relieved from
his command of the Southwestern di
vision, with headquarters at Oklahoma
, City.
The transport Sherman will sail
from this port on Monday, May 1, at
noon for Manila. She will take the
Ninth Infantry. Colonel James Regan
; commanding; the Second Squadron of
I the Seventh Cavalry, Major L. S. Mc
i Cormick commanding, and 142 re
| cruits. She will carry the usual nura
; ber of officers high in rank, among
I whom are: Colonel G. S. Anderson.
: Eighth Cavalry; Lieutenant Colonel HJ.
! B. Robertson, Ninth Infantry; Major
!F. B. Jones, Ninth Infantry; Major
j Alexander O. Brodle, military secre
i tary's department; Major Paul E.
Shillock, medical department, and
j Major P. G. Wood. Twelfth Infantry.
Surgeon Edmund D. Shortlldge.
who haa been stationed at the Presidio
and Fort Miley for the last two years,
i will leave for his new post at Hot
Springs. Ark., to-day.
Brigadier General T. McGregor, re-
I tired, and Lieutenant Emery C. Hatha
i way, Ninth Cavalry, from Fort Riley,
! on leave, registered at the department
headquarters yesterday.
The transport Logan, which sailed
I from Manila on April 15 for this port,
iis due at Nagasaki to-day. She haa on

DOG'S BITE THE CAUSE
OF A DAMAGE SUIT
Evidence Regarding Vicious Charac
ter of the Canine Is Contradictory
and Delays Decision.
J. J. Fograrty. a letter carrier, testi
fied yesterday in Justice of the Peace
Danels' court that he was severely
bitten by a vicious dog belonging t<
Mrs. Joseph C. Kanny at 236 Elsie
street one day while he was deliver
ing the mail.
Fogarty exhibited two scars on one
of his left legs to the court in sup
port of his claim for $299 damages
against Mrs. Kanny. John Wichmer,
another letter carrier, swore the dog
was vicious and that he had notiflM
the owner that unless she tied the
animal up he would not deliver her
letters.
Mrs. Kanny. in her own defense,
said the dog was 11 years old and had
no front teeth, so he could not bite
if he was so inclined. She was sup
ported by a dozen of her neighbors,
all mothers of children, who testified
that the dog was "the pride of the al
ley" and "the pet of the children" and
the dear thing was incapable of harm
ing any one. Owing to the contra
dictory evidence Justice Daniels took
the case under advisement in view of
the fact that under the law it is not
enough to prove that a dog: is vicious,
but it must be shown that the owner
had been notified to that effect. In
other words, a dog is entitled to one
bite before his vicious character can
be determined. â yS&KgSJgB *
