CHICAGO. June 20.â So many State delegations swung into the Fairbanks column fo-day that before noon the Indiana Senator appeared to be practically certain'of the nomination for the Vice Presi
dency. New York's declaration for Eoosevelt and Fairbanks to-night was all that was needed to win over the undecided delegations. One resnltof the day's conferences is that the forthcoming plat
form will have a strong "stand-pat" plank relating to the tariff, the revisionists having failed to make any headway. Apparently the national convention will nominate candidates, adopt the platform and
adjourn without the semblance of a contest to disturb the harmony of the proceedings.

SIMUCHEN. Manchuria. June 20.â
The Japanese artillery at the battle of
Vafangow included heavy siege guns
using lyddite and sweeping the entire
battlefield. Th* Japanese suffered tre
mendous losses In turning the Russian
right, one battalion of the Twenty
sixth Regiment being annihilated. Tha
hospital station at Vafangow was re
peatedly struck by thÂ» enemy's shells,
which mutilated the Russian tvounrteci.
LIAOTANO. June 20. â A correspond
ent who spent the night at Haichens
reports having heard heavy firing to
the southward and believes It to have
been either an attack upon Tashichiao
or the fleet again bombarding the
coast, near Kaipinsr. The firing con
tinued from 10 o'clock at flight until
2 o'clock in the morning.
JAPANESE USING IAT>DITE.
It is estimated that the Japane?<Â»
force moving northward Is 70.000
strong, with 90.000 men In the aggre
gate engaged In the operations at Port
Arthur.
NEWCHWAXG. June 20.â A Russian
officer who was wounded in the battle
at Vafangow (Telisau) told a corre
spondent that the losses on both sides
were severe. He places the Russian
casualties at 7000. He says no soldiers
in the world could have withstood the
Japanese as they have been fighting
lately. Their artillery fire, he says. Js
marvelously effective. The Russians
fought stubbornly, desperately, but
were unable to withstand the enemy's
dashing persistency.
Several hundred wcunded Russians
have been sent north, owing to a lack
of hospitals and surgeons. The Jap
anese buried most of the Russian dead
after the battle.
RUSSIAN PRAISES THE FOE.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 20.â A de
tailed report of the Russian losses at
the battle of Vafangow, given out thl3
afternoon, places the total at 200Â©
killed or wounded, mostly men who
belonged to the troops forming: the
Russian right flank.
The Emperor has received the follow
ing dispatch from General Kuropatkin:
â¢"The enemy in the direction of
SaimatZ3e and Fengwangcheng have
not only stopped but have made a retro
grade movement. They have evacuat
ed several point3 toward the north of
Fengwangcheng, which until recently
they occupied.
"The movement of the Japanese
troops toward the Dalime defile has
been stopped, but a rather important
movement of the Japanese forces h3Â«
been discovered in the direction of
Siuyen and Haicheng or Siuyen and
Tashichiao."
Chinese who witnessed the fighting
from the Russian side report that the
Russians removed many dead on the
trains with their wounded, and that
they buried or cremated many corpses
in the village of Huasungkou before
they retreated.
The number of prisoners and trophies
taken by the Japanese is increasing.
General Oku is not yet able to report
the total number of prisoners.
SLAV REPORT OF IXJSSES.
Up to June 17 General Oku had
buried 1j16 Russian dead, and he re
ports that many more dead have been
found.
TOKIO. June 20.â Further reports re
ceived here show that the blow in
flicted by General Oku upon the Rus
sians in the fighting at Telissu (Vafan
gow) on June 15 was more severe than
at first was believed. The number of
Russian killed in this battle probably
will exceed 2000, and their total losses,
including prisoners, is estimated at 10,
000. The Japanese losses are less than
1000, or about one-tenth of the Russian
total.

While this is all very remote from

This attitude seemed to irritate some

Considerable criticism has been di
rected at Senator Fairbanks because
of his failure to definitely declare his
position. All that it has been possible
to obtain from him was a statement
that he did not consider the honor one

failed almost in their inception and it

The "stalwart" faction in the Wis

a vain search for a single member of
the credentials committee who will
shoulder the task of making a
minority report in case the majority
favors the "stalwarts." This failure
has discouraged . the La Follette fac
tion, . it is reported,- to the extent of
abandoning the contest even before the
committee. Should this . be done they
could go before the Wisconsin voters
with the claim of unfair treatment and
as having been denied a hearing at the
hands of the committee. It will *be
much/ more desirable to the "stal
warts" to have the La Follette griev
ance thoroughly aired in the conven

their case settled by default. This

HAS NO PREFERENCE. '
The delegation from New Mexico or
ganized to-day, but. expressed no pref"
erence for a Vice- Presidential nominee
and took no action on the tariff ques
tion.
At a meeting of the West Virginia
delegation Senator Elklns was indorsed
for Vice President, while Fairbanks
was declared to be the delegation's
second choice. ,
At a meetings of the North Dakota
delegation there was discussion of the
question of tariff , reform, based on
Senator Hansbrough's resolution, but
the decision was reached by a majority
vote to support the policy of antUre
vislon. The prevailing opinion was fa
vorable to a declaration on the lines
that were followed four years ago. By
general consent Senator Hansbrough
was placed on the committee on resolu
tions and no objection will be made to
his offering the resolution. â¢'
... Fairbanks and "stand pat" is the.po

â¢ The Hawaiian and Porto RIcan del-
Senator Fairbanks made a speech of
some length, saying that he had not
been a candidate and was^not a candi T

changed his position from the time he
was first mentioned for the place. He
would not be r>ut in . the attitude of
seeking the place. -
Members of the delegation said that
the Senator would accept, but it was
not the intention of Indiana to present
his name to the convention., -

"LILY WHITE" DELEGATION*.
Members of the delegation differed
as to the ' position the State should
take, in view of this development, but
individually several said they would
like to have the Senator nominated,
and the State would appreciate the
honor of Senator Fairbanks' nomina
tion. . :
CHICAGO, June 25.â The Indiana
delegation held a meeting in Governor
Durban's room to-day, when the Vice
Presidential nomination of Senator
Fairbanks was discussed. After ad
journment it was stated that they were
just where they were before, without
definite plans. At the same time, it
was said that the attitude of the dele
gation was that Indiana would be
pleased to have Senator Fairbanks re
ceive the nomination. A motion de
claring this to be the sense of the
delegation was made, but Senator
Fairbanks said that was more than he
desired, and the motion was with
drawn. . ,

State Delegations Select Members of
NAMED IN CAUCUS.
Indiana's - Delegation
Would Indorse
Fairbanks.
After the New York State delegation
had adjourned with three cheers for
the ticket there came the first en
thusiastic incident of the day. Senator
Depew, trying to pa33. downstairs, was
intercepted by a crowd of delegates,
among whom were many Indiana .men.
Compelled, amid great cheering and the
music of a band to speaK, Senator De
pew- said:
"We of New York have held a con
ference which will be ratified to-mor
row and the next day. We have nom
inated Theodore Roosevelt for Presi
dent and Charles W. Fairbanks for
Vice President and they will be in
dorsed. We have written a platform
of principles and they will be ratified
to-morrow or the next day. We are
people who have" received grace and are
absolutely sure of salvation. Our con
vention is quiet because a certainty
produces no excitement. In conventions
when they riot and fight they fear pub
lic opinion. I have never seen more
harmony than that at the New York
meeting to-night. That 13 important
because as goes New York so goes the
nation."
The New York State delegation in
caucus to-night Instructed Senator
Thomas C. Platt, by motion of Gov
ernor Odell, to cast their votes for
Theodore Roosevelt for President and
Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana for
Vice President. The meeting was ver>
harmonious. Governor Odell personally
named Senator Platt as chairman and
moved that he cast New York's vote as
a unit. When the Governor moved that
New York instruct for Fairbanks for
Vice President there was a cheer and
former State Senator J. S. Fassett said:
"I want to say that I think Governor
Odell's proposition a very sensible one.
We all know Senator Fairbanks and
we all know that he is a capable and
patriotic man. He will lend strength
to the ticket." The resolution was
unanimously adopted.
Prior "to this one of the delegates
had asked that Theodore Roosevelt be
selected as the choice for President and
the chairman putting the motion said:
"AlPln favor say aye; there are no
negatives."
Senator Depew was chosen chairman.
All of the Brooklyn delegates, includ
ing Lieutenant Governor Woodruff,
v/ere absent, but it was understood
that they were being, dined and they
had previously acquiesced in the pro
gramme followed by the delegation.
DEPEW MAKES SPEECH.
CHICAGO, June 20. â Elihu Roofs
positive refusal to be made a candidate
for the Republican nomination for
Governor of New York this fall has
proved a heavy blow to the Platt fac
tion in the State which had counted
upon being able to abring about the
election of an executive whom Gov
ernor Odell could not control. Senator
Platt has not abandoned the Idea of
forcing Root to accept by nominating
him regardless of his wishes, but the
former Secretary of War has permitted
no doubt to remain as to his determina
tion. He did not hesitate to-night to
declare his attitude. He was informed
of the report that in his talk with Sen
ator Platt yesterday he had positively
declined the Governorship.
"That is true," he replied.
"Is your refusal positive?" was
"Yee, it is," Root said.
"Do you care to assign any reason for
your refusal'"
"I have been away from my home for
five years," Root replied, "and I feel
that I ought to be let alone."

resolution, which is the "Iowa idea" up
to date, is as follows:

should be broad enough t6 furnish com
fortable standing room for alt Republicans
who bellev* in the essential principles and

the time-proved policy of protection.
Second â An unmistakable recognition nt thÂ»
fact that tariff schedules must b* readjusted
at reasonable Intervals to ni.-.-r the chansvi*
conditions of production; and that any such
readjustment should bo made by the friends
of protection.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, June 20.â With the time
occupied in caucuses of State delega
tions, which, with a few exceptions,
were mere ratification meetings held to
approve State convention programmes,
the day preceding the opening of the
Republican National Convention has
been the quietest ever known as the
forerunner of similar gatherings. Sena-
the Lack of Excitement.
Contention Delegates Are Ennuied by
NO CONTESTS PENDING.
Several other EUfr^estions, not now
contained in the prepared draft of the
platform, will be made. One of these
declares for international arbitration.
Another, urging that the Interstate
Commerce Commission be given more
power to enforce its Gecisio-ns, will be
offered.
WANTS OF THE TERRITORIES.
The Territories are in a turmoil
about the declaration as to their ad
mission into the Union. New Mexico
and pome Oklahoma men want a dec
laration in favor of a bill which has
passed the House and is pending in
the Senate, providing for the admis
sion of Arizona and New Mexico as
one State and Oklahoma and Indian
Territory as another.
The Arizona delegates are much op
posed to anything being done, while
the Indian Territory delegates say that
Statehood is so remote that they want
a declaration of the home rule idea in
the making of appointments in Ter
ritories.
Some interest was displayed during
the day in the effort that is being
made to secure the incorporation of an
anti-polygany resolution in the plat
form. It is being urgeG especially by
various women's organizations that
have been so active in the tight to
unseat Senator Smoot of Utah. One
prominent man, who is a member of
the resolutions committee, said that
there could be no harm in a declara
tion against po-lygamy any more than
in a declaration against bigamy. But
Senator Smoot believes that any dec
laration on the subject will be used to
his disadvantage in the Senate. Also
it is felt that there is a possibility that
any declaration might materially in
jure the Ilepublican prospects in sev
eral Western States where there is a
large Mormon vote.^
CHICAGO, June 20.â The men who
are to examine fhe platform, which
has been in the possession of Senator
Lodge for several days, have been se
lected by the various State delega
tions and there is practically no doubt
that the declaration for protection will
be emphatic and that there will be but
little comfort for tariff revisionists. A
pledge to make changes in schedules
when such changes are necessary is
the only concession that will be made
by the 'stand-patters. " Possibly the
wording may be changed and those
who have been talking revision will se
cure the use of the word "revised" to
express the idea that is to be con
veyed, but even this is considered
doubtful. The majority are against
having anything like a general revi
sion of the tariff suggested and they
will contend for the words "changes
in tariff schedules" when "conditions
make them necessary" a? being ample
to cover all that is intended by the
Republican partv.
Senator Hansbrough. who intends to
offer a provision for a revision declar
ation, has not received much support.
Only Oresc-n seems to have approved
the revipion idea, the Senator's own
State delegation refusing to give him
support. Oregon also declared against
a ship subsidy, but it is not intended
to make the declaration for an im
prcvement of the merchant marine in
dorse any particular plan. Various
plans are now being considered by the
Joint Congressional Commission, but the
platform will not attempt to anticipate
the commission's report.
ANTI-I > OL.YÂ«AMY PLAXK.
Expressions of genuine regret at the
absence of two faces familiar at similar
gatherings four, eight and twelve years
ago are heard on every side. Men who
have played leading roles in the art of
making tickets and platforms, men
whose personality, shrewdness of quali
fications and persuasiveness have
changed entire States or sections of
the country, are missed in the hotel
lobbies and various headquarters. Some
of these have figured in Republican
conventions for a quarter of a century,
notably the late Senator M. S. Quay
of Pennsylvania and the late William
Sewell of New Jersey.
One whose absence is felt more, per
haps, than that of any other man, is
the late Senator Hanna,' though his
debut on the political stage was of more
recent date. Numerous pictures of the
late Senator attest to his popularity.
But the absence of the great men
mentioned does not indicate that the
caste of the play which opens at the
Coliseum to-morrow has been weak
ened. In the shoes of the men who
have passed away are politicians
equally astute, who have had their
training at master hands. They may
not be so well known in national af
fairs and their names not so effective
to conjure with, but they are ready
and competent to perform any task
that offers. The only difficulty is that
the task is not there. Contests worthy
of the name are utterly lacking.
The tight between the La Follette
and "stalwart" factions in Wisconsin,
the contest between the Addicks and
the anti-Addick? faction in Delaware,
the "lily white" and the "black and
tan" factions of Southern. States were
disposed of with so much dispatch that
they failed to furnish the gossip
necessary to an interesting convention.
About all that was left to feed the
craving delegates for excitement and
to furnish a topic of conversation was
the question of how long Senator Fair
banks' inscrutable silence would con
tinue.
Â¦ The principal. diversions were offered
by the caucuses of the Iowa, Illinois
and Washington delegations. Governor
Cummins presented to the Hawkeye
delegation the "Iowa idea" in an en
tirely new dress. It was in the form of
a set plank setting forth the idea of
the declaration for reciprocity and the
reduction of tariff schedules. It was
rejected by the delegation and this
sounded its death knell so far as the
present convention is concerned.
In the Illinois caucus the contest was
for-<he chairmanship of the delegation.
Senator Cullom was opposed by the
Yatcs faction, but won out handily. It
is conceded that his defeat would have
prevented his re-election to the Senate.
In the Washington caucus Senator
Ankeny was elected national commit
teeman against the combined opposi
tion of formrr Committeeman James
M. Ashton and J. S. McMillin. both of
whom were candidates for the position.
What has been popularly termed the
"Indiana puzzle' 1 was one of the fea
tures of the day. The members of the
delegation from the Hoosier State met
to determine their course in regard to
the boom for Senator Fairbanks for the
Vice Presidency. Senator Fairbanks at
tended the meeting and addreesed the
delegates. He talked for fifteen min
utes, the meeting adjourned and the
delegation was no wiser concerning his
wishes beyond a reiteration of his
statement that he did not desire his
State to present his name for the Vice
Presidency.
When the leaders reached a
few days ago they found nothing for
them to do. The programme for the
convention was mapped out weeks ago
and there was a full realization that it
was unalterable. ;..:
tors and Representatives* in Congress
were ax thick on the streets and in the
hotel lobbies as in the national capitol
when a particularly uneventful or dry
debate is in progress in Congress. Fig
ures prominent in the political strife
of former national conventions were
everywhere. They mingled with dele
gates and others not on the inside,
talking of anything which promised
even momentary interest.

E. S. Farrington; committee on cre

T. Robinson will serve on the rules
committee, and E. A. Knudson will no
tify Mr. Roosevelt of his nomination
for President.
"The candidate of the Democratic
party must be a man who has stated
hla principles and can be . trusted to
apply them with firmness and cour
age." . .
"Be It resolved, That a committee of
twenty-five, of which the chairman
shall.be one, be appointed by the chair
to present this protest to the St. Louis
convention."
In the course of the resolutions this
declaration is made as to a candidate:
The party should refdse to follow the
leadership of such men as August Bel
mont, declare the resolutions, adding
that the Albany platform failed to
make a single issue with Republican
policies, contained no denunciation of
"President Roosevelt's usurpation of
power," no reference to the breach of
faith with Colombia, no opposition to
the government of colonies by this re
public and no condemnation of monop
olies in private hands. The platform
adopted to-night denounces protection
of monopoly by tariff and concludes:
"The present issue is whether the
beneficiaries of special privileges shall
control the Government or whether it
shall be administered for the protection
of the rights of all the people."
BEL.MOXT DENOUNCED.
"Judge Parker is the candidate of
tariff beneficiaries, imperialists, mo
nopolists and those who profit by spe
cial privileges and seek to uphold them
as vested rights.
The platform adopted at the meeting
opens by condemning the expansion
pqlicy of the Republican administra
tion. In speaking of the recent Demo
cratic convention, the platform recites
that the convention instructed for Par
ker .by a vote of 301 to 149 and that
many of those who voted against this
resolution of instruction represented
the Democratic districts of the State
where enthusiastic support of the nom
inee is essential to party success. The
platform goes on to say that Parker's
candidacy is discredited by the char
acter of his sponsors and that neither
he nor .those who spoke for him have
presented his canaidacy so as to de
serve success. The platform continues:
"Judge Parker Is silent. Senator Hill
speaks for him. We know Senator
Hill's record. As Governor of the State
of New York he blocked the secret bal
lot. As Senator he opposed his party's
position on the tariff and income tax.
The people of New York expressed
their opposition of Senator Hill when
he was beaten for the office of Govern
or in 18D4 by 156.000 votes. Neither
harmony, confidence nor success can
now follow his discredited leadership."
The platform continues by saying
that Parker was elected Chief Justice
of New York in 1898 because the name
of his opponent did not appear on the
ballot of the Citizens' Union in New
York City, and then says:
A DO 1*1 PLATFORM.
NEW YORK, June 20.â Cooper Union
was crowded to-night at the anti-
Parker convention called by some of
those who do not concur in the Parker
instructions given at the New York
State convention. W. J. Bryan was the
principal speaker and when he ap
peared on the platform was enthusi
astically applauded. Before making
his address he said he would not name
his favorite candidate for President,
but he made a savage attack on the
"reorganizers" and vigorously opposed
the nomination of Judge Parker, who
was held up as the candidate of the
corporations and not of the people.
Judge Samuel Seabury of the City
Court, who presided, spoke of Parker
as the candidate of the "plutocracy."
He advised the meeting to repudiate
Parker and urged the sending of a del
egation to St. Louis to protest against
his nomination and to assure the con
vention that if nominated Parker could
not carry "the State of New York.
Dissatisfied Democrats Adopt
a Platform in Which Judge
Is Referred To as the Candi
date of Tariff Beneficiaries
The agreement of the delegates to
name George A. Knight for confirma
tion by the convention as National
Committeeman for California was ful
filled to-day. When the delegation met
in executive session this morning the
first question to be taken up was that
of the selection of a National Com
mitteeman. True to his word, A. Ruef,
who has aspired to the honor himself,
arose and in a speech rich with eulogy
and commendation Dlaced Knight in
nomination for the office. The nomi
nation was indorsed by acclamation.
The delegation avoided a possible
contest between Ruef and Short for
appointment on the platform and reso
lutions committee by delegating to
Chairman McKinley authority to ap
point all members of Â«-ommittees. Mc-
Kinley forthwith named Short to act
on the platform committee and dele-
Rated Ruef to act on the committee
on rules.
The withdrawal of Gunst as a candi
date for appointment on the notifica
tion committee left the way clear for
the appointment of Governor Pardee,
and this action on the part of Chair
man McKinley permanently disposed
of what threatened yesterday to de
velop into an unpleasant controversy.
Judge McKinley next appointed E.
D. Roberts of San Bernardino honorary
vice president from California, George
W. Reed of Oakland to act on the cre
dentials committee and C. E. Clinch of
Grass Valley a member of the commit
tee on permanent organization. Gunst
i\as given the honor of representing
California on the committee that will
notify the nominee for Vice President
It was the general belief when the
delegation met in the Auditorium at
10 o'clock this morning that it would
declare in favor of Fairbanks of In
diana. After some discussion, how
ever, the Californians decided to fol
low the majority of the big Eastern
States and a>vait an official declaration
of Mr. Roosevelt's desires before com
mitting themselves on what appears
to be the only open Question that will
come before the convention. A ma
jority of California's delegation favors
Fairbanks, but does not desire in any
way to run counter to the wishes of
the President. In all probability Mr.
Roosevelt's wishes will be made known
to-morrow. The announcement of Cal
ifornia's position will immediately fol
low.

STOCKHOLM. June 20.â A local
newspaper publishes a letter to the
Emperor of Russia purporting to have
been written by Kugene Schaumann,
the assassin of Governor General Bob
rikoff of Finland, the original of which
Schaumann said would be found upon
his bodv after his deed had been com
mitted. The letter follows:
"Sire: Through the Senate, xrhich
Is obedient to Bobrikoff. the latter has
succeeded in creating lawlessness in
Finland. Through lies and false rep
resentations Bobrikoff and Plehwe
(Minister of the Interior) have induced
your Majesty to issue ordinances in
compatible with Finnish laws, which
you promised at your succession to
guard firm and unshaken.
"Many of the officials of the Eiate
have been removed without a trial in
favor of fortune hunters and others
ineligible to state offices under Finnish
laws, and your most intelligent and
truest subjects have been banished.
"Plehwe. whose duty it is to report to
your Majesty all matters concerning
the Grand Duchy of Finland, is not a
Finlandor, has no knowledge of Fin
land's laws and customs, and has com
mon interests with Bobrikoff, there
fore vour Majesty does not get a true
knowledge of the real situation.
"As it is not probable that the real
eituatlon will be known to you in the
near future unless Bobrikoff be re
moved, there is only one way to take
ee'f-defense, and that is to render him
innocuous. The remedy is violent, but
it la the only one.

ST. PETERSBURG, June 20.âNego
tiations for the purchase by Russia
of six Argentine cruisers had almost
reached a successful conclusion when
Argentina raised the question as to
what (lag they would be transferred to,
she being unwilling to sell direct to
a belligerent. The medium through
which negotiations were conducted sug
gested that they be transferred to
Venezuela or Costa Rica or Bulgaria,
which would turn them over to Rus
sia, but President Roca rejected the
proposal, insisting that -a bona fide
power should be the purchaser. Then
Turkey negotiated through the Argen
tine Legation at Paris. The result of
the negotiations is not known.

NEW YORK. June 20.â X cable dis
patch to the World to-day, which was
not signed and which probably was
forwarded by the American legation in
Peking, announced the . shooting of
Colonel Edward Emerson Jr., one of

that Colonel Emerson had been shot

-6T. PETERSBURG. June 20.â An in
terview with Baron Suyematzu, pub
lished in Paris and suggesting that
Japan is willing to accept the media
tion of a power equally well disposed
to Russia and Japan, while regarded
as a tentative utterance, attracts mur-h
attention, coming from Marquis
Ito. It is generally interpreted as
meaning that Japan is shrinking before
the prospect of a long, exhausting war.
Government ofRcials do not show the
slightest disposition, however, to relax
their position, the Sentiment being
that, having been forced into the war
and driven to make heavy sacrifices,
to stop Just now, when Russia is pre

FRESNO, June 20.â The remains of
an unknown man were found along the
Southern Pacific Railroad track this
morning and were picked up bit by bit
and placed in a market basket. So
thoroughly disfigured are the remains
that no trace is left whereby he can
be identified save a light brown cap, a
leather watch fob and a pair of buck
skin gloves.
Last night as the midnight freight
passed through Selma a fire broke out
in a Jruit car at the end of the train.
The car was backed up to the tank,
uncoupled and the fire put out.
As the train pulled out a tramp pass
ing the livery stable of G. R. Sweeney
stopped and told a strange story. Ac
cording Â¦ to his story he and another
man, who is thought to be the one
killed, were beating their vay. He
noticed the fire in the car and ran
ahead on the top of the train and re
ported to the engineer. The man se
cured a bucket and filled it with water
and started back along the top of the
train to put the fire out. He said as
he rushed along in the dark he ran
into a man and knocked him down,
causing him to roll off the car.
With the remark, "I wonder what
happened to him," he strolled down the
street. He has not been seen since.

TANGIER, June 20. â Apparently
there is another hitch in the negotia
tions for the release of Perdicaris and
Varley. Authorities at the British
consulate express the opinion that Sat
urday will be the date for the release
of the prisoners. It appears that
Raissouli suggested to Mohammed el
Torres, late representative of the Sul
tan of Morocco, that the exchange of
prisoners be made through Zelal, Gov
ernor of the Beni tribe. Zelal refuses
Raissouli's proposition to take the ex
change away from the Beni tribe,
which seems to indicate fear of his
own followers.
Kaissouli's Proposition to Exchange
Prisoners Through Other Than
Bonl Tribe Is Opposed.

PERSONAL.
Of course, you are soiiig to have a pe
riod of rest thin year, but do not decide
as to where you will pass this season
until after you have read "Vacation
1304." This is a book issued annually by
the California Northwestern Railway
Company, which gives informatio'n re
garding the many rest and pleasure re
sorts to be found on that road. These
resorts are numerous enough and varied
enough to supply thousands of people
with whatever may be needed in the way
of relaxation and recreation, and a"t
prices which may suit every one's pocket.
To be^in with; there is no prettier part
of California than that through which
winds the California Northwestern Rail
way. This is. In itself, a pleasure, and
this is enhanced by the splendid equip
ment of the road and the ceaseless
watchfulness, care and unfailing cour
tesy of the employes.
Aside from the attractive features of
the road, the country traversed by it is
richly endowed with mineral springs,
which restore health and vigor to the
ailing; woods and copses in which game
abounds, running water and lakes in
which swimming and boating may be in
dulged, and streams from which the
trout may be drawn In all its beauty.
While enjoying these, poople may live in
tents, farm houses or hotels, just as In
clination suggests.
Information on all these features is
found in "Vacation 1904." which contains
over 150 pages, and which is richly il
lustrated. The cost of maintenance at
each place is. also given from $7.00 per
week upward.
"Vacation 1904" may be had at the of
fices of the California Northwestern
Railway, or hf mail, in response to a re

I was comifierÂ«d to be In politics because of

The address was received with the
greatest enthusiasm, and general in
quiry was made as to how the clergy
men could each help in returning Sena
tor Bard to the United States Senate.
My answer is: No,
The Senator will come from Southern Cali
fornia. There is no man in Southern Cali
fornia .who is Senator Bard's peer In character

REV. DR. C. G. BALDWN. WHO IS
A STRONG ADMIRER OF SEN
ATOR BARD.
Thomas Rickard of. Berkeley, an ac
tive, able and popular Republican, en
tertains some notion of going to Con
gress as the representative of the
Third District, and from all accounts
he will not ask the Governor or ' the
prospective Cabinet Minister from this
coast for permission to submit his
claims to the convention.
The story that the Contra -Costa
County. Republican Committee Intends
to appoint delegates to the Sena
torial nominating convention is dis
credited. Information comes that
the delegates will be chosen by primary
election, in which all voters of the
party in that county will have a right
to participate. Considerable resent
ment has been aroused in Republican
camps of Contra Costa, County by the
report that George Hatton had quoted
Senator Perkins as saying that- Bel
shaw ought not to be nominated for
the State Senate.
There are many indications that M.
F. Cochrane of San Rafael will be
nominated by the Democrats as a can
didate for State Senator in the Marln
and Contra Costa District.
It is the talk of the political camps of
the Third District that State Senator
G. R. Lukens, who is a candidate foi
the Republican nomination for Con
gress In that district, stands high In
the favor of the State administration.
It is said that Lukens would lend his
influence to advance the Senatorial as
pirations of the Governor.
The gossip goes that Congressman
Metcalf looks with special favor on
State Senator Joseph R. Knowland as
a Congressional candidate, and the in
ference is derived that Mr. Knowland
would like to see Mr. Metcalf in the
Senate as the successor of Senator
Perkins. This alignment therefore
presents Lukens as the Governor's fa
vorite and Knowland as Metcalf's
friend and supporter.
Leading politicians in Contra Costa
County were informed yesterday that
State Senator Charles M. Belshaw
would not under any circumstances
enter the Congressional fight this year.
He expects renomlnation and re-elec
tion to the State Senate. The Call is
informed that' Lieutenant Governor
Alden Anderson of Solano has no in
clination at present to go to Congress,
and he will not enter the contest for
the nomination.
KICKAKD IS AMBITIOUS.
LUKENS VERSUS KNOWLAND.
Affairs in the 'Third Congressional
District continue to engage the atten
tion of politicians. The Call's announce
ment, published some. weeks ago, that
Victor H. Metcalf would be tendered a
position in the Cabinet has been veri
fied. It is regarded as certain that Mr.
Metcalf will accept. There is a general
Impression that his acceptance has al
ready been signified to the appointing
power. There Is a common impression
also that Mr. Metcalf expects to be a
candidate to succeed George C. Perkins
in the United States Senate four years
hence. Senator Perkins, however,
whose health seems to improve, with
experience in public life, will probably
be found ready and willing to succeed
himself. Governor Pardee also has an
Inclination to serve the commonwealth
of California in the Senate of the Unit
ed States, and every one knows that if
he enters the contest four years hence
he will go in to win.
Lucille Mulhall is 19 years old and
won her tlt!e of champion steer roper
in South McAlester, f. T. She once
gave a performance . before President
Roosevelt in Cheyenne, Wyo., when she
tied a steer in twenty-eight seconds.
.ST. LOUIS, June 20.â Colonel Zach
Mulhall, the wealthy cattleman, who
shot three men on the "Pike" at the
World's Fair Saturday night, was re
leased to-day on bonds of $20,000.
Colonel. Edward Butler was his surety.
This caused some surprise, as it had
been decided to hold Mulhall pending
the outcome of the wounded men's in
juries. ><
"There's only one thing I am sorry
for." declared Mulhall to-day, "and
that is that this innocent boy got hurt.
Whose bullet it was I don't know,
but- I do know there were several in
that crowd who were popping at me."
Nearly. 200 friends of Colonel Mulhall
called on him to-day and about seventy
telegrams expressing sympathy were
received from various parts of v the
country.
The colonel is an old friend of Pres
ident Roosevelt, but he refused to say
whether he had received any message
from the President. The shooting was
the culmination of a dispute between
Mulhall and Reed that started some
time ago, when Reed objected to the
amount of feed given to the colonel's
horses, which wÂ«re a part of the Wild
West 'show.
One of the attractions of the show
Is Lucille Mulhall, the colonel's daugh
ter, who recently won a $10,000 prize
for being the champion steer roper of
the world.
Colonel Mulhall is one of the best
known men in the Southwest. He has
been In the cattle business since he
was a boy and owns a ranch of six
thousand acres near Mulhall, O. T.,
which was named after him. He has
frequently been urged to become a can
didate for Governor.

In this connection the necent order
of Secretary Hay Is Interesting to note
â that no more will the word United
States appear In connection with the
foreign legation. or consulate. It is to
be the "American" legationâ the
"American" consulate over the. door, on
all the stationery, seals, stamps, etc.,
etc. He prefers the word, he says; It
la brief and carries a dignity, that the
other does not. Besides there are other
United States, but all up and down
the Western hemisphere and elsewhere
there Is but one America.
Ministers and Consuls have urged
that Congress should correct these evils
so far as possible by legislation, espe
cially that pie conditions under which
American citizens expatriate them
selves may be defined and that for
eigners mav no longer be granted cer
tificates of citizenship except through
the slow processes of the Federal
courts, a longer residence and a more
thorough test as to the understanding
and appreciation of the benefits con
ferred.
England, by act of Parliament in
1870, changed the status of the married
woman, but the United States still
holds to the old rule. It is a rule that
does not work both ways, for an Amer
ican woman marrying a foreigner re
tains her nationality, while an alien
woman marrying an American becomes
thereby an American citizen. The
American woman living with her hus
band in his own land may acquire citi
zenship there, but she does not thereby
lose citizenship here.
The word citizen here has no dis
tinction of sex and in this has lain
a fair share of the international dis
putes that have attended the whole
matter. The question has arisen as to
the return of Mrs. Maybrick after her
long experience in an English prison.
Having been the wife of an English
man was she not to be rated as an
alien convict, but the question was
quickly disposed of. She is still an
American citizen. In every country
save where the English common law
prevails the nationality of the woman
merges, when she marries, into that
of her husband.
CASE OF MRS. MAYBRICK.
It may be interesting to recall tha't
this right to shift allegiance, now, so
lightly exercised and almost universal
ly acknowledged, was not formally as
sented to by Great Britain until so re
cent a year as 1870, when Parliament
declared that a Briton was no longer
such when he fc-rmally became a citi
zen or subject of another state. The
contention that a Briton could not de
nationalize himself or even that his
sovereign could not denationalize him
was stoutly adhered to all the way
down to 1S14, when she abandoned it
to the- contrary contention by the Unit
ed States and exchanged certain pris
oners of war, formally her subjects,
but taken in the service of this coun
try. And the curious thing about it
was that at that time there was no
such thing as a "citizen of the United
States." Such a thing had no- defini
tion until article XIV, amended, de
clared that "all persons born or natur
alized in the United States and subject
to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens
of the United States and of the State
in which they reside."
The doctrine of Jefferson had, pre
vious to that time, been assented to â
that a person was a citizen of the
United Slates only as he was a citizen
Â«'f one of the States. A person so un
happy as to have been born in the
great public domain, in the Territories
or in the District of Columbia, was
not a citizen of the United States,
though subject to "their" jurisdiction.
Since the war and the fourteenth
amendment â the influence of both of
which is as meaningful to the white
as to the black â and the United States
has come to be spelled "it" in its
grammatical relation, a person born or
naturalized in the United States is a
citizen of that country whether he has
a residence in any particular State or
Territory or not. A person may be
a citizen of the United States without
being a citizen of any State, but none
may be a citizen of a State without
being also a citizen of the United
States.
It is quite the thing to accuse the
United States of failure to protect its
citizens abroad, but the records in such
cases at the State Department show
that in almost every instance where
such charge is made the alleged victim
was either of doubtful nationality or
he had invoked the power of his adopt
ed country to relieve him of the penalty
of an obligation assumed prior to his
having become an American citizen. It
is these "citizens," many of whom can
not speak the language or have not
spent time enough in the country, to
understand or appreciate remotely its
institutions, that are forever creating
embarrassment and irritation in our
international relations.
SHIFTING ALLEGIANCE.
The thing has been done so often
that even the obscure Consuls know
that it is useless to report the case.
The naturalized citizen learns and must
Kara that when he passes beyond the
jurisdiction of the United States he
must beware.
To the man who seeks to evade du
ties and obligations imposed by his
native land by moving beyond its
borders this serves as a most attractive
invitation to "join us." Having so
served the newly made citizen may go
swaggering back to his native land
with a chip on his shoulder to find that,
however benevolent Uncle Sam may
be in his intentions, he cannot by any
law of his own annul the laws of other
countries. So the man who, to escape
service in the army, for instance, ran
away to America and returns to his
native land a citizen of the United
States, depending upon the expatriation
act to protect him, will find that law to
be entirely impotent in the matter let
him beseach and annoy the American
representative 'as he will.
Congress passed a law â June 27, 1868 â
known as the expatriation act, in
which it is asserted that "all natural
ized citizens of the United States, while
in foreign countries, are entitled to and
shall receive from this Government the
same protection of person and property
which is accorded to native born cit
izens."
While the naturalized citizen remains
in the country of his adoption and be
haves himself he is on all fours with
the native born, but when he goes
abroadâ for instance, to his native
country â it is different.
enough to enlist Uncle Sam to back
him in hifc roguery or deviltry abroad.
MAKES TKOUBLK ABROAD.
This is the law and so far it is so
pood. A lengthened period of probation
is advocated and educational and even
financial qualifications are suggested
by those who would hedge tho Ameri
can citizen about with safety measures.
But there arf those who think the chief
laxity of the law as It is lies in the fact
that the final paper may be issued by
Judges of the lesser courts Tho may
bo influenced by impending elections
and ward bosses or upon whom, at
loast, frauds may be practiced in the
hurly burly of such times. The advo
cacy is that the Federal, courts should
have exclusive jurisdiction in the mak
ing of American citizens, just as the
Federal Congress has the exclusive
right to legislate in the matter.
But even those who believe that this
change would go far toward remedying
the evil of eitizenship-made-too-easy
would add several years to the period
between Castle t.arden and the first
vote, together with an acquaintance
with the American language, if not
with the constitution itself. It is not,
however, with the citizen who has be
come naturalized for the purpose of
voting that the representative abroad
or the State Department is concerned.
It is the fellow who is far-sighted
This fact is a large Influence in .lie
movement to set a higher valuation
upon American citizenship to be ex
pressed in adding diffk ities to the
trick of securing it. Under the law a
foreigner is iequired to reside in the
< oUntry for five consecutive years. Two
y*ars before he can hope to secure his
Jinal papers he must file a declaration
of his intention to make such applica
tion and at this time he must under
<>ath renounce aU other allegiance and
promise "support of the constitution of
the United Stales. At the time of his
rinal application two citizens must tes
tily to his contiguous residence for the
time prescribed and hp must prove that
during that time his behavior has been
good and that he is attached to the
principles of the constitution. The
Â« ountry of his former allegiance must
be at peace with the United States or
he cannot be admittedâ not until the
war is over.
HIGHER VALUATION
With this explanation the feeling of
irritation passes and the movement of
the ships is affirmed. But the incident
has served to quicken interest in a
question that has ever vexed the State
Department and worried American
Ministers and Consuls around the
world. It is the question of the natur
alized citizen when he goes abroad.
He causes nearly all the trouble â at
least he causes a great deal of it. In
the pride of his new nationality and
his vast appreciation of its greatneps
and power he is apt to become ob
noxious and require the aid of Amer
ican representation to get him out of
the resulting Jail.
John Hay asked the Question and,
fortunately for Mr. Perdicaris, a few
were able and willing to answer. He
is an American all right. His father
vkas a naturalized citizen and while
serving as Consul at Athens the son
was born in the consulate. So his title
Is clear and although he has taken
up his residence at Tangier these many
years, he resided here long enough in
New Jersey to be esteemed a citizen
of that State. *~~" '
The stories, of his reai estate holdings
at Tangier and the barbaric splendor
of the furnishings of his palaces ana
the manner of his living sueeested to
everybody's mind a Prince of Morocco.
His father, who gave him his name,
was a Greekâ that was apparent. But
had he ever seen Broadway or the
statue of liberty of which he had been
deprived, that he called upon Uncle
Sam in the name of his citizenship to
rescue him at any cost to Uncle Sam

al complication.

Perdicaris was carried off into the

rected at the United States and the

to Tangier the plain American citizen
was roused from the contemplation of
his peaceful pursuits by emotions that
were considerably mixed. The first was
interest in the picturesque affair, the
second approval of the prompt and
businesslike rescue measure and the
third was irritation. Sentiment that
provoked the first two was overtaken

IS THE AMERICAN BECOM- fc/
tNO A OOURMAND ? X ZA
In our largest cen- / I \ j J
ters of population, / \ 1 I
such as New York and / 1 J J
Chicago, we daily see \l/
more attention jjiren Vv
to the inner man.
Cafes aad lunch-rooms are filled vilh inei
and women who seem to gire all their time
aad attention to thoughts of properly oi'
improperly feediajj their stomaebs. "II i:
of course best to eat slowly, but not ten
much," eays Dr. Pierce, chief consulting
phjrsiciaa to the Inralids' Hotel and Sur
gical Institute, of Buffalo, N*. Y. In thi?
ioth century people devote so much trnc
\o bead work that their brain is fagged anc
there isn't sufficient blood left to properly
take care of the other organs of the 6odj\
The stomach must be assisted in its hard
workâ the liver started into actionâ by the
use of a pood stomach tonic, which should
be entirely of rentable ingredients and
without alcohol. After years of experience
in an active practice, Dr. Pierce discovered
a remedy that suited these conditions in s
blood-maker and ti*iue-builder. He cailt-c 3
it Dr. Picrce's Golden Medical Discovery
âan alterative extract that assists in thÂ«
digestion and assimilation of the food in
the etomacbâ so that the blood gets what
it needs for food and oxidation, the liver it
at the same time started into activity anc
there is perfect elimination of waste mat
ter. When the blood is pure and rich, all
the" crgant wort without effort, and the
body is like a perfect machine.

In a free lecture last night before
a large audience at the American
Academy of Sciences, 819 Market
street, Harley R. Wiley, special lec
turer on jurisprudence at the Univer
sity of California, discussed the many
notable American qualities. He chose
for his address, which lasted nearly
two hours, the title, "The "American
Character." After comparing this at
some Â¦ length with the characters of
other nations, he spoke of the impres
sion Charles Dickens received when he
visited this country â impressions, for
the most part, humorous and satirical:
and then of Kipling, who perceived not
only the humorous and comical side,
but also the destiny of a great peo
ple.
Mr. Wiley deplored the American
habit of scattering intellectual forces
over a vast field. He attributed this
somewhat to descent -from a pioneer
people who *had been compelled to
work at almost everything. In clos
ing he remarked on the American ten
dency to go to the extreme In all
things, as well as to develop an inten
sity that has its culmination in pat
riotism.

The striking stablemen heard of the
injunction restraining them from ha
rassing the Nevada Stables at about 6
o'clock yesterday evening. Their
nightly parade was omitted and their
pickets were called in from their posts
before the stables. The enforced with
drawal of the boycott was accepted
quietly on the surface, but Individual
remarks from the strikers showed that
Judge Hunt's decision was very un
popular. There Is nothing to prevent
the seventy other stable owners who
advocate "open shop" from obtaining
the same relief from the boycott.
The' Stablemen's Union held a meet-
Ing last night in the Foresters' build-
Ing, at which they decided to stand
firm, providing they receive financial
aid from other unions.
Upon reading and filing the complaint of
plaintiff herein, duly verified, and It appear
ing therefrom that it is a proper case there
for, upon the motion of the plaintiff it is
hereby ordered that on Friday, the let day
of July A. D. 19(M. at the hour of 10 o'clock
a. m. of that day. or as noon thereafter as
said matter can be heard, the defendants here
in show cause, at the courtroom of said court,
why injunction should not be iftsued against
them In accordance with the prayer of the
complaint herein. And. in the meantime, and
until the hearing and disposition of said mo
tion for said injunction, it is ordered that
said defendants herein, and pach of them, be,
and they are hereby, restrained and en olned
from In anywise Interfering with, or harass
ing, or annoying the plaintiff In the conduct
of hi? business at his stable, known as the
Nevada stable, situated at "Xo. 1350 Market
utreet. In said city and county; or from or

sentatives or pickets for the purpose of In
ducing the customers of plaintiff to quit deal
ing with him. or from in any way using or

customer or customers; or from causing said

dating or coercing or attempting to molest, in
timidate or coerce any customer, patron or
employes of the plaintiff while working for
or dealing with or employed by him In said
business.
The attorney for the alliance says
that the order of Judge Hunt Is the
strongest restraint against the actions
of unions that has yet come from the
local courts. It is given herewith:
The pickets who have been parading
with banners in front of the Nevada
Stables since the strike of the union
stablemen have been ordered by Su
perior Judge Hunt to cease their dem
onstration. The Stablemen's Union and
Its representatives are enjoined specifi
cally from committing any of the acts
complained of by E. G. Pierce, pro
prietor of the stable, until the court
can hear his application for a perman
ent injunction on July 1.
Bush Finnell, attorney for the Citi
zens' Alliance, who is prosecuting the
case for Pierce, appeared before Judge
Hunt to secure the temporary restrain
ing order. The defendants named are
as follows. Stablemen's Union, Locar

BERKELEY, June 20. â The 117 students of
the civil engineering department of the Uni
versity of California who composed the sum
mer school at Santa Cruz and Monterey re
turned to Berkeley yesterday, after being away
for three weeks. Their camp was pitched on
the ocean shore, near Santa Cruz, and from
that point all their work of purveying and
mapping out the country waa carrteU on. In
struction was carried on under the direction
of Professor E. N. IÂ»routy and Instructors J. J.
Ji-i.su p, C. A. Lorlng, H. R. Ebright and R. B.
Boyd.
Professor F. T. Blolettl of Cape Colony,
South Africa, has been called to the university
as an assistant in viticulture. In consultation
with Professor E. H. Twlght he will carry on
Investigations In the vineyards of the State.
The viticultural office of the agricultural de
partment will be materially strengthened by
the services of Professor Bloletti. Professor
Twlght has bÂ«en the sole Investigator for
more than a year, and the work became so In
volved that he was not able to give all the In
vestigations as much attention as he would
like. This became known to the nowly or
ganized California Viticultural Association,
and through its influence the attention of
President Wheeler and the Board of Regents
was called to the matter. The result of the
agitation was the appointment of tho new
assistant.

With the possibility that failure to
act might involve a prosecution for
malfeasance in office, the Board of
Education to-night directed that no
pupil shall be admitted to the public
schools with the new term opening un
less the scholar shall show satisfactory
evidence of successful vaccinatk/n.
This action was taken upon " a state
men made by Dr. W. K. Foster, secre
tary of the State Board of Health,
who appeared before the school direc
tors this evening, supplementing a let
ter he recently wrote on the subject of
vaccination with an oral explanation.
Secretary Foster said the law was
on the statute books requiring the vac
cination of public school children, that
it had been upheld by the Supreme
Court and that the State Board of
Health wxmld be compelled to enforce
it. Dr. Foster explained that it was
impossible for him not to recognize the
existence of the law.
"What could happen if the Board of
Education should not enforce the law?"
queried Director A. H. Pratt.
"Well, the board might be proceeded
against for malfeasance in office," re
plk'di Dr. Foster.
In this view of the situation the di
rectors decided to re-enact the rule
that was adopted six months ago but
had been rescinded because of much
protest from parents who objected to
the vaccination of their children.
Director Hardy reported that the
Board of Supervisors would receive
bids for the $960,000 school bond issue
up to July 5 at 10 o'clock a. m., and
would open them at 11 a. m. The
bonds will be sold for delivery Sep

With the issuance to-day of a license
to marry, a. pretty,, rorrtance is uncov
ered in the 'life of the Rev. August
Drahms, chaplain at the State Peni
tentiary at San Quentin, who will wed
his schoolday companion and friend for
many years, Miss Jessie P. Danford of
Aurora, 111.
In their childhood days Dr. Drahms
and Miss Danford were boy and girl
together at Geneva, a town near the
present home of the bride prospective.
They went to school together and en-
Joyed a friendship that ripened as the
years rolled by, growing stronger and
stronger. Now in the older days, that
friendship became the stepping stone
to closer relation. A year ago Dr.
Drahms won the hand of Miss Danford.
She leaves the East this week for Cali
fornia and will meet her intended hus
band at Sacramento. The pair will be
married at the residence of Mrs. George
W. Watson, Eighth avenue and East
Eighteenth street, this city, on June 30.
Mrs. Watson was a school teacher of
the clergyman and his brfQe. Chaplain
Drahms is 55 years old and Miss Dan
ford is eight years younger.
The recnt meeting of the board of directors

r<rtor5 1* tu be h Id In the East in Septem
t>er and It Is rxiwctrd that at that session
it wi'l hv. decided Just what improvements
and addition* erÂ« to be made' to the plants.
Our work" In Oakland are to come In for a
inrjr* share of the expenditure to be made, in
expanding: the manufactori'a of the corpora
tion. Mr. HuntinKton'n aggressive policy in
business is known to nil and his election as
the head r.f the director* of the corporation is
Â¦ cuarantee that it will move ahead In a
husinem way. At present the Oakland plant
nippilea all of the I'aclflc Coast territory as

wi^fc the work* at Haycnne, X. J. In the
O-r.tral Stsfs the territory Is fiupplled by our
plant at Do Kalb. III.
Extensive improvements and addi
tions are to be ,mad,e to the plant of
the Pacific Steel and Wire Company,
located near Twenty-third avenue, and
which is controlled by a corporation
that is fast becoming a formidable
competitor of the United States Steel
Trust. H. E. Huntington has been elect
ed manager of the board of directors of
the company, which has plants at New
Haven, Conn.; Bayonne, N. J.; De
Kalb. III., and this city. D. O. Mills
is also heavily interested in the cor
poration and is a member of the board
of directors.
Frank L. Brown of Alameda, man
ager of the Pacific Steel and Wire
Company, has just returned from the
East, where he attended the meeting
ot directors of the major corporation
and at which Huntington was chosen
manager. In speaking of the plans of
the company. Mr. Brown said:
Oakland Oflice San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, June
ALAMEDA, June 20. â Through
brooding over the treatment accorded
her by her husband, Mrs. A. W. Tesche
of 1709 Eagle avenue became despond
ent and after^ addressing a farewell
note to the man whose name she bears,
swallowed carbolic acid to-day in an
attempt to end her life. Her rash act
was quickly discovered by neighbors,
who heard the woman's groans and
summoned Dr. A. A. Stafford to at
tend her. After much effort the phy
sician succeeded in overcoming the
effects of the deadly potion and saving
the patient from death.
According to persons living in the im
mediate vicinity of the Tesche home,
quarrels between the husband and wife
have been frequent and to more than
one neighbor the woman complained
that she was abused by the head of the
house. Tesche and his spouse have
both been married bgfore, the former
having two daughters, aged 10 and 7,
by his first wife, and Mrs. Tesche hav
ing a young son by her first husband.
Tesche's girls make their home with
him, but Mrs. Tesche asserted to
friends that Tesche would not allow
her son to make his home with them.
This, it is said, was the chief cause of
the differences of the pair and indi
rectly the motive of Mrs. Tesche's ef
fort to commit suicide. Tesche is in
the employ of the Southern Pacific
Company.
All this is to cost many thousands of
dollars â thousands that the students
are not prepared to spend now, for it
is the students that must foot the bills.
The football field alone will require
between $14,000 and $17,000. In addition
to the $4000 for excavating, it will cost
from $10,000 to $13,000 to build the
bleachers that are to surround the field.
The other things will come in time, as
the students find the means to pay for
them. A field with an ordinary wooden
fence and bleachers, everybody knows
will not be a very sightly adjunct to
Hearst Hall, and all the haste pos
sible will be made to carry out the
great plan.
The income from games will be de
voted to paying for the stadium. The,
first intercollegiate game between Calfc*
fornia and Stanford will be played thts
year on the new field. A large sum
will be saved 'the university for Â£he
rental of grounds, which in other years
have cost about $5000 for a single day.
Excavating for the football field will
be a simple matter after all, when the
immensity of the whole project is
taken into account. In -time the en
tire Hillegass Tract will ba transformed
into one broad athletic stadium, state
ly and classic in its surroundings.
There will be, besides the football field,
baseball grounds and an athletic oval,
so arranged that they may be turned
into one field. A grand sweep of level
ground will stretch from Hearst Hall
to Barrow street, the whole surrounded
by majestic columns.
BERKELEY, June 20.â The first
shovelful of earth for the athletic
stadium that is to form an important
part of the greater University of Cali
fornia was turned this morning on the
Hillegass Tract, which is included in
the area covered by the Hearst plans.
Here, where the trials of brain and
brawn of future generations of college
athletes will be desperately fought, the
earth is being twisted and molded into
shape. For a thing meaning so much
to California the first turning was sin
gularly barren of formality and hardly
passing notice was given it. There
was no ceremony, no speechifying â
only a word from the- foreman and
the digging began.
"With plows and scoops the crowd of
workmen set about the task of digging
a big hole in the earth opposite Hearst
Hall and between College avenue and
Barrow street. About 12.000 cubic yards
will be taken from an area a little
larger than a football field, for it is
proposed to build only the football field
now. The plans call for the removal
of the top soil, which will be stored
until a sufficient depth of the clay sub
stratum is removed and then replaced.
It will take more than a month to do
this and the cost will be about $4000.

KEAIi ESTATE TK.\.\ SACTION [S.
Supervisors Talcott. Mitchell and
Rowe based the opinions expressed in
favor of the Crandall-Silva end on the
ground that minor parliamentary de
tails had not been observed by the fac
tion attempting to depose Crandall.
Crandall. head of the fighting end of
Jhe tanple. was formerly chairman of
the I'nion Lalmr party. At a meeting
held on April 1 a motion was made to
(Srpoaa him. Of the seventeen member?
of the committee present thirteen voted
him out of office. He ruled the motion
Â«'Ut of order and abruptly adjourned
the meeting. The thirteen members
ihen reorganized the central commit
tee by electing Lawrence A. Hyde as
ihairinan and retaining A. W. Ather
'An as secretary.
Crandall. with the following of four
â¢m-mberp. held a meeting of their own.
They filled the thirteen vacancies and
formed a new committee, of which II.
J. Silva was elected secretary. Both
committees have been asserting the
functions given under the law, and
:he matter now ha? come to a show
down before the Board of Supervisors.

Foreign Governments had been duly

Naturally I imagined that I should
have no difficulty in obtaining the in

was referred to the "Private Secretary

written communications passed be

I was finally informed 'that there was
nobody in that huge department who
could answer my query. What was
meant, of course, was that there was
nobody present who would assume the
terrible responsibility of giving out a
mite of information for publication.
An American editor would delight in
"showing up" things of this 6ort, but
an English editor of a staid, respecta
ble, run-in-a-rut penny journal would
regard such exposure as "rank sensa

GENERAL DUNDONALD has been compelled to
resign as commander of the Dominion regulars
and militia. He criticized the parsimony of the
Government in the matter of military equipment and had
to resign or be dismissed. Dundonald is a fighting
Scotchman, but likes to have something to fight with.
When he found the transportation facilities of the Cana
dian army reduced to eleven pack saddles he concluded it
was time to let ''Our Lady of the Snows" know that she
was in danger, and # now some other great captain will

He is unduly excited about the United States and de
clares that Canada owes the integrity of her territory
to the forbearance of others, meaning the United States.
He* may calm his ruffled nerves. Thi9 country has no
warlike designs upon Canada. We have some people
who talk annexation and Canada has some. But we
doubt whether the people of the United States would
take Canada if it could be done by passing a resolution.
We would not look passively upon the conquest of Cana

Russian authorities ask us to believe that the battle
of Vafangow and the attack on Japanese transports were
part qi a great strategical movement that bristles with
potentialities of woe to the Japanese. The information is
a glad acquisition to our knowledge of the Czar's fight

that the Russian heroes either can't fight or won't.
"No," he rerflied, "that is all we shall

B. LISLE SNELL.
It is recognized as a thoroughly legi
timate charge. To this extent do Lon
don editors aid and abet in police cor
ruption and bribery.
News is gauged by a very different
standard from that which prevails in
America. The managing editor of a
great London daily once handed me a
proof with the observation that it con
tained something which might be
worth cabling. It stated that two
Americans had been arrested at Char
ing Cross for shooting at each other
and would be arraigned in Bow-street
police court in the morning. No names
and no particulars were given.
"I suppose you have a reporter out
running the story down," I remarked,
being then somewhat green with re
gard to English journalistic methods,
"and will get the rest of the story
later."
No official Information Is ever given
to reporters at Scotland Yard or the
police stations concerning murders,
suicides, burglaries or any crimes of
sufficient magnitude to be of public in
terest. Judicial inquiries are the only
recognized source of legitimate official
information on such subjects.
When a reporter is put on a criminal
story, if the facts are not obtainable
in any other way, he tackles some po
liceman concerned in it and privately
offers him a shilling or two to tell what
he knows about it. The money is al
ways taken provided the policeman
runs no risk of being detected .by some
superior official, but often the Informa
tion is not worth the price paid for it.
Frequently it % is manufactured on the
spot for purposes of revenue only. The
usually phlegmatic British Bobby can
develop a very lively imagination when
there is a prospect of earning a few
shillings thereby. But the reporter
gets his money back. In his weekly ac
count he charges:

lice So much
recognized even by the most conserva
tive British journals as legitimate Jour
nalism, but it is not practiced to any
thing/ like the extent that it is In
America. British officials high and low
have a great horror of it. Mr. Cham
berlain may be interviewed in America,
but never would he submit to it in
England. When a reporter seeks in
formation of the London County Coun
cil he is given a paper to sign by which
he pledges himself not to use what he
learns in the form of an interview and
not to mention the name of his Inform

The transformations which have thus
eet Fleet street agog will have to be
followed sooner or later by other con
temporaries who will find it impossible
to sustain dignity and dullness on
dwindling circulations. As the London
morning dailies circulate all over
Great Britain many provincial papers
will undoubtedly be compelled to fol
low their lead. It marks a new era In
British Journalism, a general waking
up and shaking up in the editorial
"sanctum eanctoriums" Â¦which have
long been consecrated to routine.
News that concerns itself with gov
ernmental or municipal departments is
infinitely harder to obtain here than
in America. Officials display much
greater zeal In suppressing Interesting
intelligence than in making It public.
Red tape, conservatism and blank stu
pidity oppose all manner of obstacles
to the reporter who has recourse ' to
any department in quest of what In
America would be regarded as perfect
ly legitimate information. A question
once arose as to the number of war

We are likely to see the South again in the position it
occupied in the campaign of 1900, when it supported
Bryan for policy and prayed for his defeat for pros
perity. When the speakers at the recent annual meet
ing of the Confederate Veterans suspended their
threnody long enough to felicitate their section upon a
prosperity greater than the South ever knew before they
furnished Republican campaign argument of the greatest
value. It proved that the prosperity brought about by
sound money and protection was not exclusively for the
manufacturing and commercial North, but is for the ag
ricultural South as well.
THE contrast between the Ripublican^ National Con
vention that meets to-day and'many of its prede
cessors is not as great as appears to some of the
special, correspondents. The fact that President Roose
velt is the unanimous choice of the delegates makes it
unlike the conventions of 1876 and of 1 880 and 1888 and
1896, when the Presidential nomination was an open
question. But the convention of 1864 was merely for the
purpose of nominating a candidate for the Vice-Presi
dency, as Mr. Lincoln's renomination was inevitable.
The same was true of the conventions of 1872 and 1900.
The issues now are the nomination of a Vice'Presi 1
dent. It is now probable the* choice will fall upon Sena
tor Fairbanks of Indiana. He is 52 years of age and a
native of Ohio. Born and reared on a farm he chose law
for his profession and was admitted to practice by the
Supreme Court of Ohio in 1874, and removing to Indian
apolis began his professional career there. After achieving
great success at the bar his political life started in 1892
when he was chairman of the Indiana State Republican
Convention, and was his party's candidate for the Senate
in 1893 in the Democratic Legislature which elected
Judge David Turpie.
He is not a stranger in national conventions, having
been a delegate at large to that of 1896 and its temporary
chairman, and in that of 1900 he was chairman of the
committee on resolutions. He was elected to the Senate
in 1897 to succeed Mr. Voorhees. and was chairman of
the United States High Commissioners in 1898 to settle
our boundary and other questions with Canada. His
present term in the Senate ends in 1909. He is of tall
and commanding presence, dignified and approachable, a
speaker of winning power, and in all respects a strong
man. His location in the 'West is favorable and adds to
the party strength in the Middle West.
The question^f platform will cause very proper divi
sions and^ discussion. The party will adhere to the
principle of protection and it need not say that the pres
ent tariff schedules are immortal. Every expression by
Democratic leaders concedes protection as our national
policy. John Sharp Williams, the Democratic leader of
the House, has broadly accepted protection and differs
only as to its extent. - As no one wants an undue de
gree of protection, going no further than is necessary to
safeguard our home market and defend the American
scale of wages and standard of living, the margin be
tween the Republican and Democratic' positions is so nar
row that it is difficult to see how the opposition can
make a vote winning issue of the tariff. Free trade is no
longer heard of anywhere in the country. This does
not mean that there are no free traders, but with both
the leading parties committed to protection they have
no party through which to make themselves felt. They
may be expected to antbush in Democratic declarations
about the trusts, using the anti-trust sentiment to as
sault the tariff. But they must work by indirection.
The country has great work before it. The Panama
canal, a work of peace and mighty in its consequences
to the whole world, must be constructed as speedily as
physical conditions will permit. It 13 of more impor
tance than anything likely to be taken in hand by any
foreign power. Other nations may make war, engage in
schemes of selfish aggrandizement and dynastic ambi
tion, but their benefits to mankind arc imperceptible in
the presence of this undertaking of the United States.
Not only will we build the canal, but in building and
administering it. our presence and example on the
isthmus will regenerate civics in Central and South
America and induce freedom and stability in those Gov
ernments where disorders have for nearly a hundred
years restricted progress and threatened the peace of the
world. President Roosevelt made this stupendous con
struction and all of its beneficial consequences possible,
and that fact alone invests the National Convention of
his party with unsurpassed dignity.
What the convention does will be ratified by the coun
try in November, because it will represent the aspira
tions and the hopes of the American people. The con
vention does not have to reverse any policy of the party
or snub any of its record. In it there is no contention
between reorganizers and regulars. All elements are
regular and there is nothing needful of reorganization.
Since its return to power in 1897 the party has adopted
the gold standard, liberalized our banking policy, made
currency panics less possible, and has so safeguarded our
trade and finances as to make it unlikely that any hard
times can ever reach the distressing proportions that
made men desperate in the awful years between 1893 and
1896.

BARBER POLESâ S. C, City. In an

operations in surgery, and when bleed

who did the cupping and bleeding. To
assist In this operation there was a pole
or staff which was grasped by the pa
tient and to this there was also at
tached a strip of bandage or fillet to
tic up the patient's wound after opera
tion. When these were not in use they
were hung at the door as a sign. This
was replaced by a red pole with a whits
strip painted around It in imitation of
a bandage wound arounct it. and after
cupping and bleeding was discontinued
as a method of treating; the sick the
striped pole was retained as a barber's

Since the catastrophe at Port Arthur
in which Admiral Makaroff and the
officers and men of the Russian battle

preciative admiration. Introduce vari

beneath a stern and Impressive ex

He spoke English with accuracy, and
because of this his intense activity and
his liking for outdoor sports, Emperor
Alexander nicknamed him "The Eng
lishman." Even when past middle age
he devoted two hours each day to
physical exercise. A favorite sport was
swimming. When In command at
Cronstadt, "Old Bluebeard" â so named
because of the huge whiskers and mus
tacheâwas rowed out from the gov
ernment quay for his dairy morning
plunge and swim. It seems the very
irony of fate that so skilled a swim
mer should have perished fit drowning.
He had a kindly heart *f or "the poor
and the unfortunate, and his morning
outings found him surrounded by the
waiting halt and blind, among whom
his copecks were liberally distributed.
Nor was he always discriminative In
his charities. "Makaroff's mendicant,"
for example, was a well known char
acter In Cronstadt. This was a de
crepit and not at all reputable old
sailor, the object of MakarofTs fre
quent charitable regards, who "wÂ«re a
placard on his breast on which was in
scribed, "I am under the patronage of

THE rating and registering of the population of the
Philippines having been completed by the United
States Government, the results of the first Ameri
can census for the islands, that of 1903, are embodied in
part in a pamphlet that has just been received from the
Federal Department of Commerce and Labor. The re
lations that San Francisco and the entire Pacific Coast
will have with the Philippines supply obvious reasons
why official conclusions concerning the islanders should
have local interest. The census was taken on March 2,
1903. There are in the Philippines archipelago 3141 isl
ands and islets that extend from latitude 4 degrees 40
minutes to 21 degrees 10 minutes north and from east
longitude 116 degrees 40 minutes to 126 degrees 34
minutes. *
Within an area of 832,968 square miles of land and
water there dwell 7,635,226 human beings, of whom
6,987,426 are classed by the census takers as civilized, or
partly so. and 647,740 as wild. The aborigines of the
Philippines are supposed to be the Negritos, and of
these 23,000 remain. They are found in many but not
all the provinces. They live in a primitive state. They
are black. Their hair is woolly and bushy: Their toes
are remarkably prehensile, and they can use toes almost
as well" as they can their fingers. They wear no clothing
excep^ a gee string. They live on such food as they can
find, have no fixed habitations or occupations, wander
about the forests and have little contact with other peo
ple except when trading. The women, as .is usual with
uncivilized peoples, do all the work. The men are skill
ful in the use of the bow. in throwing stones and in
making a fire, which they do by rubbing together two
pieces of dry bamboo. These facts, recounted by the
census officers, may be generally in the public mind, but,
as the Negritos are considered the progenitors of a
very numerous population, some few general facts of this
sort may well be recalled for the proper understanding
of several interesting questions.
How the civilized or partly civilized and the wild
Philippine islanders are distributed among the prov
inces is all made clear by statistical tables that are sup
plied in abundance in the census report. It is of less in
terest to the general reader to find out about that than
it is to learn of some more general characteristics from
official sources of the people whose interests are now
.bound up with those of the! United States to a certain
extent.
The civilized Filipinos are classified by the census in
eight tribes â th'e Bicol, Cagayan', Ilocano, Pampangan,
Pangasinan, Tagalog, Visayan and Zambalan. Since the
discovery of the Philippines by Magellan in 1521 the
population has multiplied fifteen tinges. While the peo
ple of Mindanao are largely head hunters, they are not
classed by the census as savages, because they raise
maize, mountain rice, taro and a fine quality of hemp. The
Moros live in Villages, generally along the seashore
or by some lake. They are famous boat-builders and also
manufacture their arms and some cannon, weave a large
amount of cloth, gather considerable quantities 'of gutta
percha annually, and those living in the Sulu group
are expert pearl divers. They have no political organi
zations, but obey' some datto or petty chieftain.
In the report Taft, Governor when the census was
taken, is quoted as saying: "Contrast the Filipinos
with other Malays and the oriental peoples, and I ask
you to name a people offering more opportunities for
development along, the lines which American ideals re
"qltire than the people 'of these islands." Director San
ger adds his own personal opinion, which is that "the
Filipinos are generally subordinate to lawful authority,
that under competent officers they make excellent sol
diers, and in the course of time will make good citizens.
The ephemeral tribe distinctions that now exist will
gradually, disappear, and the Filipinos will become -a
numerous and homogeneous race, exceeding in intelli
gence and capacity any other people of the tropics."
No attempt is made in the pamphlet referring. to the
population to give statistics regarding Philippine indus
tries. Facts of that sort will be published in detail by
the Census Bureau. It is of some interest to learn that
in a general outline of physical conditions the Census
Bureau estimates at this time that there are about 12,
000,000 acres of private lands and 61,000,000 acres of pub
lic lands. Of the latter 40,000,000 or more acres are
forest, leaving about 21,000,000 acres available for agri
culturevand capable of producing all kinds of tropical
fruits and vegetables and many of those usual in the
temperate zone. The' forest lands are estimated to be
worth $2,000,000,000. . *

"The Lights o' London" has every
thing that melodrama demands â
human interest, natural pathos, thrill
ing situations, abundant wholesome
comedy and climaxes that serve as
preludes to vigorous and repeated cur
tain calls. The piece is well mounted
and the bridge scene Is particularly ef
fective. The dive for life Into the
Thames (a huge tank of "real water")
Is highly realistic.

The Alcazar Stock Company began
the final week of its engagement last
night in a very creditable production
of Clyde Fitch's pastoral comedy,
"Lovers" Lane." There Is much to
amuse in the piece and a great deal
that touches the heart strings. The
parts are all well sustained, prominent
among them being that of Simplicity
Johnson in the capable hands of
Frances Starr, who again has an op
portunity to display her versatile tal
ents, an opportunity of which she
takes the fullest advantage. John B.
Maher Is capital in the dual role of
Uncle Bill and Mr. STcillig, the man
ager of the opera house, who is his
own bill poster. Miss Marie Howe is
perfectly at home as Matty, the min
ister's housekeeper, and her work,
which is at all times clever, meets
with the approbation of her audience.
George Osbourne is as reliable as ever
as Hosea Brown and James Durkin
acts intelligently the part of the min
ister, barring a slight disposition to be
too mournful. Adele Block is accept
able as Mary Larkin and Adele Bel
garde is convincing as Mrs. Wood

taken care of by Luke Conness, Harry

The recent awarding of contracts for
supplies for the State insane asylum
at Napa bodes trouble for the direct
ors of that institution. A report was
circulated yesterday that several local
business houses, which have been in
the habit of bidding Tor tire asylum
contracts, feel grieved over the al
leged unfairness of the directors in
making awards and are preparing to
enjoin the latter from carrying out
their recent decision. It has" been
charged that instead of awarding the
contracts for supplies of butter, eggs
and other provisions to the lowest and
most reliable bidder, as provided by
law, the directors have been giving the
contracts to the highest bidders.
The claim is made that the direct-*
ors of the asylum have acted in this
unlawful manner on several occasions
and naturally aroused much dissatis
faction among many local firms which
had submitted lower bids than the ones
accepted, and have qualified in every
manner required by law. Among the
dissatisfied firms ia Lundy & Co. of

of "The Mormons" -last night. They
worked earnestly and with intelligence
to make the most of the material fur
nished them by the author, but what
they made of it fell far short of adding
it to the season's dramatic successes.
For whatever hits were scored the in
terpolated matter was solely respon
sible. When the players got away
from the book and introduced busi
ness of their own manufacture they
lightened up the gloom.
Among the specialties that brought
recalls was Edna Aug*s imitation of
Elfie Fay, who was headlined at the
Orpheum last season as ,**The Crazy
Soubrette." Some of the folk who
were awakened from sedateness by the
Imitation declared that it was several
degrees crazier than the original. Tork
and Adams created hilarity by poking
into the second act some of the
parodies and duologues that they had
tried and found not wanting in vaude

any of his colleagues in making fun
out of his allotted lines, and Ben Dil

Gallick sang three songs and got
thrice as many floral tributes. Mr.

the vocal gem of the show. Stage

money won by \V. M. Scheftel, owner
of High Ball, that won the Derby on
Saturday, fall ridiculously below the
real mark. The New York stockbroker
won $320,000 on the victory of his colt,
according to his own statement while
dining with friends last night. .
"I began betting on High Ball with
Eastern bookmakers when High Ball's
price was as good as 30 to 1," said he.
"More than $300,000 in wagers and
nearly $27,000 from the purse was my
good fortune. Of course the trip here
was a costly one. taking about $10,000
off my winnings."

CHICAGO, June 20.â Rumors that
the racing season- at Washington Park
would terminate with the last race to
morrow were heard in all of the places
where sporting men congregate this
afternoon and to-night, and every at
tempt to secure a denial or confirma
tion of the story from the officials of
the club was futile.
If the racing season comes to a sud
den end to-morrow afternoon it will
be due to the stand which Mavor Har
rison has taken on the betting ques
tion. His decree that there be no bet
ting, and the rigid manner in which
the police have enforced it, has led to
diminishing crowds.
Rumor That Track May Close.

SEATTLE, June 20. â Seattle won the
last game with the Los Angeles cham
pions to-day, thus making the series
a tie. Baum, who pitched such a good
game against the Siwashes on his first
appearance, was driven to the woods in
three innings. Ten men went to the.
bat in the second inning, five hits were
made and five runs scored. Captain
Flood finished the game In the box.
He was touched ur> for eight hits, but
held the runs down to five.
Shields came within a hair's breadth
of making a record. Up to the ninth
inning Los Angeles had only one hit
and not a base on balls had been given
by Shields. In the ninth Toman hit
for two bases and Flood got a base
on balls. No runs were scored, how
ever, as Shields, contrary to his usual
custom, held his nerve and scored a
shut put. The score:

llunroe's plans are unsettled. His
manager, Harry Pollock, wired to sev
eral theatrical managers yesterday in
an endeavor to make some arrange
ments for a starring trrur for the miner.
If he does not succeed in getting what
he wants, Munroe will remain in the
city till the fight. Pollock will prob
ably leave for the East to-day or to
mcrrrow and in the meantime Billy
Roche will look out for Munroe's . in
terests.
Jfffries will leave Harbin Springs to
day and go to Oakland, where he will
rest his injured knee and have it
treated gradually so that he will be
ready to fight when time is called. He
Â¦will not leave the State before the
battle and will probably return to Har
bin again to train for the encounter.
Van Court came into the place load
ed down with bills. He flashed the big
roll in a triumphant manner and an
nounced that as long as there was so
much talk about Jeffries not having
the price and so forth, he would show
'cm all by ignoring a check altogether
end bringing forth the real coin.
Pollock Insisted on a 50000 forfeit,
and when this was made known to
Van Court he looked disappointed. He
stated that he understood that 52500
vas the specified sum and accordingly
went to the bank and drew that
amount. After a discussion it was
agreed that 52500 would do. provided
that 52500 more be deposited by each
man on August 1.
Jeffries was represented by De Witt
Van Court, and Pollock appeared for
the miner. A large crowd of sporting
men was oresent to see that the deal
vent through all right and each one
seemed satisfied when the 53000 was
turned over to the stakeholder, Harry
Corbett.
ThÂ» flret step toward bringing Jim
Jeffries and Jack Munroe together for
the heavyweight championship of the
world next August was taken last
night at Harry Corbett's when repre
ecntativefc of the two boxers got to
gether and posted forfeits of $2300 each,
guaranteeing the appearance of the
men in the ring. Manager Harry Pol
lock, representing Munroe, originally
Insisted on a 55000 forfeit, but finally
consented to 52600 with the provision
that the balance be put up on Aug
ust J.

More than a quarter of a mile from
home "Jack" Martin was sitting so
still on Dekaber, who was then a close
third to Pacemaker, that her ultimate
success was predicted. When Martin
called on his mount she was able to
outstay both others. The time was not
fast, 1:54 1-5, or two seconds slower
than the track record.
Both Savable and Whorler, high class
racers, were defeated in the nine-fur
long handicap, won by that shifty
mare, Dekaber. But her victory can
to some extent be attributed to early
pace-making tactics of Whorler and
Savable.
SHEEPSHEAD BAY, June 20.âVisit
ors to 'the beautiful grounds of the
Coney Island Jockey Club to-day left
the course declaring that they had seen
an excellent day's sport, ending up
with a dead heat, which was followed
by a run-off almost as exciting as
the original.
The dead heat, cool-headed observers
thought, should have been won as easi
ly by Dainty. The rider of Jennings'
mare, however, fumbled with his bridle
near the finish and the never ceasing
efforts of Burns on Sheriff Bell got
that much improved gelding up in time
to make it nobody's race. The owner
of Dainty desired a division of the
stakes, but Hayman insisted on a run
off and this was done.

Special Dispatch to The Call
PUEBLO, Colo., June 20.â Two de
ported union miners from the Cripple
Creek district, John Yates and Peter
| Styler, members of the last party sent
i beyond the borders of Colorado and in-
J structed not to return, arrived in Pu
eblo this mornins: half dead as the re
â¢ suit of the torture to which they were
j subjected a week ago in the Victor
1 bull pen. They were sadly In need of
j medical attendance, which they claim
' they were denied by the military au
j thorities. They tell a story of alleged
I barbarism committed, they allege, un
j der the direction of Adjutant General
I Sherman Bell, in command of the Na
| tional Guard forces in Teller County,
; which is under absolute martial law.
They claim they were strung up by
' the thumbs for four hours and sweated
I for information they were supposed to
) possess concerning the perpetrators of
: thr recent Victor depot explosion out
! rage, which resulted in the death of
i fourteen non-union miners and the per
; manent injury of a score or more.
This, thev say, occurred last Tuesday
"morningr Just before the departure of
th*; deportation special for the State
line. Failing to force a confession Gen
eral Bell, the miners claim, had them
cut down and hurried them to the de
pot at the points of bayonets. Packed
in box cars like sardines, thev aver,
j they were twenty-four hours on the
Â¦ journey and were finally thrown off
1 among the barren eand dunes of South
i em Colorado and driven across the
i State line into New Mexico.
With great labor the two Injured
miners were carried back to the first
j station on the Denver and Rio Grande
I road and sent to Pueblo in a box car.
j Here they found friends who will care
for them and endeavor to bring their
cases before the Federal Court. The
thumb on either hand of each man is
sadly torn and mangled. Their arms
are swollen and black from the fingers
to above the elbows. Both protest that
they know nothing concerning the per
petrators of the Victor outrage.

AGAINST BELL
He declared that all the preservers
were stamped 1S91.
To United States District Attorney
Wise Flanagan said he had no license
as either master or mate. His duties
were to take charge of the deck crew.
"Did you ever have a flre drill?"
Flanagan placed his hands on his
forehead and then replied:
"Not to my memory. I did not keep
track,"
"Have you ever seen the flre hose un
coiied since the season opened?"
"Not to my memory. 1 don't recall
it. I have been very sick."
Flanagan said he never counted the
life preservers aboard, but he was con
fident that more than the 2500 called for
were aboard and within easy reach of
the passengers. In his opinion the life
preservers were in first-class condition.
Adjourned until to-morrow.
NEW YORK. June 20.â The list of
those who perished on the General
Slociua is growing at an alarming
rate. Bodies came to the surfo.ee to
day off ihe shores of North Brother
Inland singly end in groups of twos
and threes until at dusk ninety-eight
additional bodies had been recovered.
Kvery pausing steamer seemed to churn
up the water to such a degree that
v. ith Us wash one or more bodies would
h'i swept on to the beach. Between
the hours of 3 and 6 in the afternoon
f.Jty-live bodies, seme of them badly
mutilated, were taken ashore by the
eiarchinsr parties.
This brings the total number of bod
ies recovered up to 730, and yet there
are something like 3-3 persons unac
counted for. A number of these are
among the 125 unidentified at the
Morgue and over ori North lirother Isl
and and the "unrecosmizable" that
have been buried in the Lutheran
Cemetery on Long: Island.
The Coroner's inquiry into the disas
ter was begun to-day. Thousands of
persons gathered in and around the ar
mory in the borough of the Bronx,
where the inquest was held.
XO FTRK DRILL.
According to the testimony of John
J. Coakiey. one of the Slocum's deck
hands, at the Coroner's inquest, he
never had been instructed in a fire
drill since he became an employe of
the Knickerbocker Company at the be-
Finningr of last season. Coakley said
f.e first lf-arned that the steamer was
on fire when a small boy called his at
tention to the smoke rolling down from
the bow. Coakley said he ran up to
vard the bow of the steamer and
found a blaze in the locker where the
oil for the lamps was kept. He dumped
charcoal on it, hoping to smother the
fames, then cut down the hose and
called for assistance. The fire was so
hot that he and those who came to
help him were driven out of the locker.l
but they pot the hose in position and
had just directed a stream on (he fire
when the hose burst. When the crew
found It Impossible to control the fire
they turned their attention to the pas-
Fencers. Coakley said he took down
many life preservers rfhd distributed
them among the women and children,
far as he could see all the preserv
ers were in good condition.
FLANAGAN TESTIFIES.
Edward Flanapan. the mate for the
last two seasons on the Slocum, said
that thÂ«* forward cabin, where the fire
broke out, waÂ» used for storing old
linens and worn out - awnings and
bropms. He had one barrel of sperm
oil there and there were some empty
barrels that had contained oil.
Flanagan said that as soon as he
vas aware of the fire he notified the
captain, calling up the tube:
"We are all afire forward."
"What answer did you get?"
"I did not wait for any answer. I
vent to the engineers to give me
water."
"Had you given any orders up to
that time to man the lifeboats?"
"Not ud to that time."
"What orders did you give your
men?"
"None up to that time. When I got
back from the engineers I manned the
pipes. Then when the water pressure
Â«ame a coupler blew off and the pipe
burst. Then we tried to reach the other
Ftandpipes, but we could not pass the
flames."
PRESENT AT INSPECTION*.
Flanatran said he was present when
the epecial inspection took place. At
this point the Coroner ordered Inspec
tors Fleming and Lundberg to leavtj
the courtroom.
Flanagan, however, said he did not
accompany the inspectors on their
rounds. He knew, he said, that ten or
twenty of the life preservers were or

WILli APPEAL HIS CONTEST
FOR FRIED3IAV ESTATE
Jose Y. de Seminario, representing
himself as the holder of' an assigned
claim from his sister Yda. yesterday
commenced suit against Edwin Mohrig
in tho Superior Court for the recovery
of $9000, which, he alleges, was prom
ised to his sister by Christopher F.
Mohrig, now deceased. It is alleged in
the complaint that Christopher Mohrig
was possessed of 518,000 in cash and
that he intrusted that amount to Ed
win for keeping until his death, with
the understanding that when he died
half of the amount was to be given to
Yda Heminario and the other half re
tained by Edwin. The trust, it is
averred, was made on April 10. 1900,
and Christopher died February 16, 1904.
Seminario hays that the payment of
$3000 to his sister has not been made.

The Tropic Bird will discharso her
cargo and be placed on the drydock
fo- a thorough overhauling. When she
is ence more tight and seaworthy, the
voyage will be resumed.
The TroDlc Bird is a vessel of 330
tons rvstllter and has for many year?
traded fcttween here and Tah'tl. She
was lÂ»uMt in 1882 at North Bend, Ore
gon.
Tht* water gained on the pumps at
the rate of seven inches an hour ami
metiers were getting serious when the
barkentine passed in tlm-mgh th9 Gold
en Ciate. When she was well insMi
the harbor no time was lost getting
sail off the vessel. This relieved the
strain on the hull and when she came
to f.nrhor the leaking was reduced to
three inches an hour.
The barkentine Tropic Bird, Captain
Eggar, which left here June 18 for
Nome, came back to port yesterday,
leaking like a sieve and getting lower
in the water every hour despite the
efforts of all hands at the pumps.
Fortunately for the Tropic Bird. h<?r
winprs had not carried her far from
port when the leak was discovered.
She sailed June 18 and June 19 at 1 p.
in., when 75 miles southwest of thft
Farallones, the carpenter reported lhe
vessel leaking. Pumps were manned,
but the water came in through the
o|,ening seams faster than the pumps
could suck it out and Captain Eggnr
shaped his course back to San Fran

Captain John J. Bradley left yes
terday for Yosemite Valley to go on the
board of court-martial proceedings now
in progress there.
Major Morrow, accompanied by his
mother, will leave to-morrow for a ten
days' visit to Yosemite Valley.
He goes from his post here on a
two months' leave of absence, but in all
probability his leave will be continued
for a:i indefinite period. He will be ac
companied <>n his trip by his little son
and h's sister-in-law. Miss Martin.
Yesterday still another report be
came current In the post that there
was a possibility that the Twenty
eighth Infantry. Colonel Owen J.
Sweet, would be ordered to Fort Jay
in New . York harbor. This again
brought an entirely different aspect to
the situation. If the Twenty-eighth In
fantry is ordered to go to Fort Jay,
the Tenth will remain here some time.
In the meantime, awaiting further or
ders from the War Department, the
Tenth has commenced in a way to pre
pare for a move, but to what place
it is at a loss to know. Whether
to prepare themselves for the chilly
blasts of the Camp Nome shores, or
for the summer heat of Seattle and
adjacent posts in Washington, or for
the fogs at the Presidio, the men now
stand in great doubt.
Chief Surgeon Thomas L. Rhoads,
United States General Hospital, leaves
to-night for Allentown. Pa., taking
with him the remains of his wife, who
died during an operation at the hos
pital on last Friday. Dr. Rhoads has
been stationed here sincr December It.
1002. and has won the highest esteem
of all with whom he came in contact.
Officers of the army, associates in the
medical corps and friends in civilian
liff* unite in tendering to him the deep
est consolation in his affliction.
The Tenth Infantry has- been In a
state of excitement and commotion for
several days over the subject of the
different rumors concerning its change
of base.
The first cause of the excitement was
the telegraphic announcement from
Washington, ten days ago, stating that
the Tenth Infantry had been ordered
to the Department of the Columbia. No
confirmation of this report has reached
headquarters here, although it is fully
time for the regiment to have received
official advice from the War Depart
ment.
Sunday came a report to the canton
ment that orders had been changed in
Washington and that the Tenth was
not to go to the Department of the
Columbia. Instead it was to go ; to
Alaska, and the Third Infantry, which
had been previously destined for that
station, was to go to the Department
of the Columbia.

Eighth May Go to Fort

bi nation to put up the rates of grain freights
under the name of "The Sailing Ship-owners'
International Union." Of the 1,800,000 .tons of
tonnage engaged In the grain-carrying trade
1,367,000 tons signed the agreement, which la
to charge a rate on Wheat from San Francisco,
usual European options, of 22s 6d and on Bar
ley 23s W. lay days to begin after July 15- The
rate oa Wheat from Portland will be 27s Cd
and from Puset- Sound 26s 3d. A local grain
shipper and buyer, being asked as to the effect
of this advance In freights on the Wheat mar
ket, said: "If this is carried Into effect It
will mean a lower price for Wheat as far as
shippers are concerned. All the shippers could
pay now at the proposed new rate on the pres
ent Liverpool basis of Wheat would be $1 12%.
and all they could pay for Barley would be
95c. There will be a good deal of poor Wheat
this year and less choice milling Wheat than
last ytar. Hence good milling Wheat will
probably sell much hlsher than shipping.
Under present Indications all the choice Wheat
will be taken by the millers, but there Is a
contingency that may offset this. The crop In
the northern States â¢ promises to be vast,
being estimated at from 1.250,000 to 1.50O.OO0
,tons, with a full crop of Barley as well. This
means a large output of Flour, of which a
large quantity would be shipped In here, and
this would naturally depress both milling and
shipping Wheat."
The feeling in the cash grain was weak yes

were tha largest ever known In this market,
being 1720 cases. The market did not weaken
under this heavy load, however, but was held
right up by the receivers, and some of them '
actually reported a steadier feeling In the fine
creameries. Still, there- is Â» large quantity
of Eaotern Butter reported on the way here,
and this has more or less Influence on the tone
of the market. Â¦ Â¦ :Â¦_ .

prospects of a possible advance, have attracted
the attention of the Oregon , Cheese makers,
and In consequence . receipts . from Oregon
showed a large Increase yesterday, offsetting
the advancing tendency of the market. Some
dealer* quoted 8c for choice mild new. but the
majority still named 8%e in view of the In
creasing receipts from Oregon.
The Egg market' was amply supplied and

The Lumber Market.
ThÂ» W**. Coast Â«nd Puget Sound Lumber-'
man say* :
"The attempt to reduce the output cf lurn
b*r in the fouth and on the coast it being 1
rnrt in a ha!f-h*arte-1 way, and dÂ»s not prom- j
1*Â« success. The same results are being
reached, however, by th# voluntary or forced
doting down of many mills. It is \-ery prob
able that this curtailment is greater than it
Â»-<-Â»uld tt from every mi'.l shutting down only
â¢>ne day In the week. In one district 60 per
cent at tiie cut is rfj-oruid out of commission.
The sblacle n;arkÂ«>t Is about as bad as It can
b<\ and any one who ne<*is r hlrutles need not j
frar to buy at present trices. Shipments for :
the first live month* of the year show a heavy
d-crtsst over the same months in lÂ»03. The
jifit two or thrÂ«* months will probably be dull
nuf% In the thingie market, and any niillman
who can cio*e his mill will be wise in so
doin*. The loÂ«r market Is generally weak.
In Pugtt Sound log* are bringing more money 1
tr.an in eny other market on the coast. The j
t-hulting down of many of the camps hae po !
far proven beneficial to the logger, but It puts j
the rr.illTnan on the Sound to a considerable 1
disadvantage In competing with mills that
buy lops in other market*. In British Colum
bia tba log market if stagnant and the log
Â«c*rs are f hutting down mar.y camps. In
Â«;rays Harbcr and on the Columbia River logs
â¢vie 'ovtrylentllul. with prices low and weak."

Nezu York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, June 20.â An unimportant vol
' ume cf business was done In the stock mar
, kvt to-day, but the tone was plainly firm, and
oonfldence over the prospect for values .was
1 thereby fostered. News bearing upon values
was slight, but In the absence of threatening
dev*lr,pments and with protection afforded to
Southern Pacific there was no urgent pres
sure to sell. Bankers usually Intrusted with
i financial operations for the company were
larpp buyers of Southern Pacific, and the of
! ferinps including several thousand shares for
i London account, were readily absorbed. The
circular issued by the president to stockhold
ers In explanation of the proposed preferred
stock Issue seemed to make a favorable lm
[iri âIon upon sentiment and was followed by
the rUe in the stock to 4tiS%- This wbb a sen
sible relief to the general market, where th<
effect of a decline In Southern Pacific had been
dreaded. Weekly estimates by rallrcad offi
cials of their traffic were little changed from
the recently prevailing tenor, but they showed
conditions no woree. Good earnings for the
Kecond week of June coming to hand make
better comparisons with last year's figures
tlitn for some time past. Missouri Pacific's
report for April, showing net earnings of less
than half those for April last year, did _ not
afff-ct the firmness of that stock. With x no
feare for the favorable progress of the crops
and with the extraordinary strength of the
backing position shown by Saturday's bank
statement there is opportunity to await the
progress of events, with opportunities for a
favorable outcome." Cash i-eservee. especially
gold holdings, are now well above any pre
vious record. The satisfaction over this show
ing has its reservations ae to Its index of idle
trade conditions and as to the responsibility
far high Interest rates on deposits paid by
the New York banks tn effecting the result,
but it insures freedom all pressure of.
securities en the market frcm the necessity
of realizing ready cash. None of the best
prices cf the day were maintained. The mar
ket became lifeless at the slight reaction and
closed stagnant.

Superior Judge Sloss yesterday heard
the arguments upon the demurrer oÂ£
the Citizens* Alliance to the complaint
of Will J. French, president of San
Francisco Typographical Union No. 21,
whereby, the latter seeks to enjoin the
Alliance from using an alleged in
fringement upon the label of the Allied
Printing Trades. After the argument it
was agreed that the court should take
not only the demurrer, but- the whole
case, under submission and therefore
the decision of Judge Sloss will doubt
less affect the mooted question of the
right of a labor union to own a trade
mark.
the case for the Alliance was argued
by Attorney Bush Finnell. John H.

on June 16.
j Robert J. Aspden, a brother of the
deceased, testified that he had been in
j formed by Miss Joan M. Hadenfeldt
that she was afraid something had
happened to his brother, as she had
received a letter from him which indi
cated an intention to take his life.' The
witness at once visited the room he
and his brother occupied and found
the note left for him before George
departed to carry out his plan of self
destruction. He at once notified the
Police Department and later the body
was found. The only reason he could
assign for the act was that his brother
had been working very hard and had
been ill. He believed his brother had
become tired of life and simply gave
up.
Miss Joan M. Hadenfeldt had been
subpenaed, but Dr. J. C. Stinson of
533 Sutter street furnished a cer
tificate saying that she was suffering
from nervous prostration and could
not appear.
Miss Hadenfeldt sent the following
communication, which Â¦was read to
the jury: y-Â« v v
To Dr. Leland: Thin Is to certify that I
have Known George Hougrhton Aspden for four
yeark. For the lsst two years we have been
associated in business. Mr. Aspden has always
been 111 more or less since my acquaintance
with him. We were engaged to be married,
but I asked to postpone our . marriage, owing
to my own health not being; as it should and
knowing him to be far from well. I. of course,
did not dream such a fatal ending would come.

The State Fish Commission has
scored a notable victory in a decision
rendered by the Supreme Court yes
terday in the case of I Thomas J.
Miles and A. S. Dinwiddie. who were
arrested in Sutter County last year for
using set nets in Sacramento Slouch. 4
The defendants maintained that they
were within their riprhts in using the
net in Sacramento Slough because it
had no tide. The court declares that
the slough is State water, even if it
has no tide. Miles and Dinwiddie
have made an unusually hard fl^ht to
defeat the commission. This makes
the fifth successive victory the State
board has won in th% Supreme Court.

Ask the Public to Help Then Enforce
the Six O'clock Weekday
Closing: Law.
The retail dry goods clerks of San
i Francisco have^ issued the following
j appeal to the toiling public: -
The retail clerks of this city appeal to you
I (or your co-oprratlon and assistance in m:iln
j tattling the tt o'clock closing hour, and for
j which they have bo earnestly contended for
! many years.
Their efforts have met with marked success
and the closing hour of 6 o'clock has not re
sulted in any loss of trade to the merchant,
owing to the uniformity with which it has
been observed up to the close of the past
year. 1903.
Tour attention is called to the fact that at
present there are a few stores (men's fumlsh
! lnr) situated on the main thoroughfares â Mar
ket and Kearny streets â who keep their 6tores
open until a late hour at night, and some of
them are open Sunday*, thus violating the laws
of both God aad man.
These stores named have expressed a deter
mination to destroy the just and humane sched
ule of working hours now in force, agreed to
and observed by all the leading stores and the
Retail Clerks' Association, namely, to close at
6 o'clock five days of the week, lo o'clock Sat
urday evening, with Sunday a day of rest.
We acknowledge the risht of any man to
conduct His business as he pleases. But we
i deny the right of any man to grind out the vi-
I tality of his fellow by demanding of him the
only few hours he has to devote to home and
social duties, because he is compelled to de
pend upon his meager wages for a livelihood.
I.*ar reader, is Â«ny member of your family or
social circle compelled to work as a. retail
t-lfrk? If there is. you know what it means to
| look at his vacant chair In the evening hours.
The plea made by these storekeepers for vio
j lating the closing hour Is that the public de
Â¦ mands it: we say that this plea Is false. The
actuating motive Is that grasping desire to se
cure something at another's expense.
To prove the falsity of this plea, we make
this appeal to all justice loving people, espe
cially those who are compelled to toll for a liv
ing.
we ask. you to apply our remedy; It is easy;
it needs no argument, no abuse, no coercion;
, It is dignity personified:
Keep away from all store* after 6 p. m.
except Saturdays and the stores will elosÂ«
themselves. Â»

result of a recent Superior Court de
cision. â
Attorney Ach raised the point that a
director In a corporation does not nec
essarily know the actions of the cor?
poration and objected to the line of
questions. Attorney Campbell, special
prosecutor, replied that he would show
that Jacob Eppinger knew of the exact
condition of affairs and he would trace
the worthless receipts on which the
loans were negotiated direct to the
hands of the defendant. Judpe jLawlor
then permitted the examination to con
tinue and Watson W. Topping, book
keeper in the local office of the defend
ant, was called to the stand. He said
his duties were to keep the grain
ledger and that he also received re
ports from the warehouse, which were
placed on Jacob Eppinger's desk. These
were, returned to him to make/copies
of, frequently'" by Jacob Eppinger in
person.
"Who had custody of the -warehouse
receipts?" was asked.
"Jacob Eppinger."
"When wheat was delivered out of
the Crockett warehouse to whom were
the receipts handed?"
"To Jacob Eppinger."
The witness testified that he canceled
the receipts and they were brought to
him sometimes by Jacob Eppinger,
sometimes by Herman and at others
by Bernard Ettlinger.
The case will be continued to-day.
TRACING RECEIPTS.
Having shown tnp shipment of the
books before the failure, the prosecu
tion interrogated the witness regarding
the methods of conducting the ware
house business and what facilities Ja
cob Eppinger might have for informing
himself as to the conditions in the
warehouse. The witness replied that
both daily and monthly reports were
sent to the office of the Pacific Coast
Warehouse Company, which, as had
already been shown, was identical
with that of Eppinger & Co. These re
ports showed what grain was brought
into the warehouse daily,, how it was
marked and what lots were shipped
out. . Copies of these reports were, made
in a letter press book, but the witness
could not say whether or no these let
ter press books had simply melted
away or were included in the assort
ment of valuable records carefully
wrapped in gunny sacks. His memory
on vital points seemed to be hopelessly
poor.
Edwin Freund, formerly bookkeeper
for the Pacific Coast Warehouse Com
pany, testified that he had been in the
employ jof the Eppingers for about sev
enteen years prior to the failure of the
firm on June 6, 1903.
"Do you know where the warehouse
books are?" was asked.
"No," he replied. â¢ â¢
" "When did you last see them?"
"In my office a day or so before the
failure."
"What became, of them?"
'"I don't know. At the request of
James Deming, superintendent of the
warehouse, I helped wrap them up for
shipment."
The witness thought this was done
between the hours of 9 and 10 on the
night preceding the failure of^Epplnger
& Â«.*o. The books \v' re then carried
on board the steamer San Joaquin. but
the witness did not know what marks,
if any, were placed on the packages.
REGULAR REPORTS MADE.
The prosecution, In the case of Jacob
Eppinger, charged with obtaining mon
ey on worthless warehouse receipts,
got down to business yesterday after
noon after days of squabbling ovpr
legal technicalities and elicited from
the lips of apparently unwilling wit
nesses information damaging to " the
defense. The most important testi
mony was given by Edwin Freund,
the former bookkeeper for the
Pacific Coast Warehouse at Crock
'ett and in the local office. Through
this testimony the prosecution seeks
to connect Jacob Eppinger with
the alleged fraudulent acts. It
tends to prove that statements show
ing the lot numbers of grain in the
Crockett warehouse were forwarded
daily to the office in this city and were
available to Jacob Eppinger, many of
them being placed directly in his
hands.
The defendant is apparently daily
growing weaker under the ordeal of the
trial. At the noon recess it was feared
that he was about to collapse and dur
ing the greater portion of the after
noon session he lay back in his chair
with eyes closed and his head resting
on the ample shoulders of his son,
Josua, apparently oblivious of all that
was' going on. From time to time when
telling points were made, however, his
eyes would partially open and other
signs of animation be shown.
Theodore D. Moines, Isidore Davis
and James Crampton corroborated the
statements made by former witnesses
regarding the quantity of wheat in the
warehouse.
PACKED UP THE BOOKS.
For a greater part of the day
he sat about the hotel looking the
picture of dlsconsolation, and toward
4 o'clock was cogitating over the best
means of replenishing himself with
funds from the" old country, when a
special delivery letter bearing the vic
tim's name and temporary address was
handed to the clerk at the hotel office.
Opening the big envelope. Von der
Becke was surprised to find that It
contained his wallet and all its papers,
excepting the $200 In currency. Sev
eral robberies of a similar character
have occurred In the hotels of this city
during the last few months and in a
number of cases, where the purses and
wallets -stolen contained papers valu
able only to their owners, the latter
have received them back by the next
mail.
The German visitor immediately re
ported his loss to the hotel manage
ment and another search of his
apartments was made, with the
same discouraging results. It was
about this time that Von der Becke re
called the Incident at the entrance of
the hotel elevato-r and readily had his
suspicions confirmed by the Occidental
attendants, who explained to their
guest many of the interesting methods
of the American crook. Von der Becke's
wallet contained $200 in American cur
rency and $500 In New York drafts in
addition to a number of other valuable
papers.
Carl von der Becke. who arrived here
Saturday from Central America on the
German steamer Luxor, had an experi
ence at the Occidental Hotel yesterday
that cost him $200. but he has philo
sophically figured out that his loss
netted him considerable knowledge of
the ways of a great city.
Â« Von der Beck is a guest at the
Occidental Hotel and was leaving
the elevator of that establishment
early yesterday morning on his way to
visit a friend, when he was suddenly
jostled by a stranger. The latter
promptly offered an apology for his
apparent rudeness and Von der Becke,
continuing his journey, soon forgot the
Incident. He paused at Sutter street
to await a car and while standing on
the corner it occurred to him that his
coat did not hang to him in it3 cus
tomary snug manner. ,A second later it
dawned upon him that a large wallet,
which was supposed to be on the inside
pocket of his coat, was missing and
suspecting that he had left it in his
room he hurried back to the hotel,
where a diligent search failed to re
veal it.
Mrs. George A. Lynch yesterday ob
tained from Judge Graham an injunc
tion to prevent her husband from
drawing his money from bank pending
the hearing of her application for per
manent alimony of $100 a month. Lynch
Is ordered to ehow cause on June 24
why the Injunction should not be made
permanent. Mrs. Lynch alleges that he
drove her from their home and that
she is without means, while he is said
to be worth $10,000, In addition to earn
ing wages sufficient to support them
both.

day to show cause why his wife, Katie
Letitia Fowler, should not have cus
tody of their minor child, Ruth. Mrs.
Fowler has Instituted suit for divorce
and in her petition to get the little

person to care for her and "is rapidly
approaching the scriptural alloted
years of life," being 66 years of age.
He is an ovster peddler and without
money, while she is only 23 years old
and able and willing to earn a liveli
hood for the child.
Ada R. Duncan, who recently sued
her husband. Benjamin B. Duncan, for

cruelty, and who has figured since in
the civil and police courts by reason
of Duncan's leaving with his money
and his brother attempting to eject Mrs.

6he would move for an allowance of
$150 a month alimony, $500 attorney's

vorce filed vesterday that of Edith P.

His abuse of her, she says, continued

MOTHER CLAIMS BABY
Albert Rosa, who keeps a vegetable
store at 626 Front street, was fighting
with his son Louis last Sunday after
noon at Twenty-eighth and Church
streets when a policeman arrested
them for disturbing the peace and
placed an additional charge of carry
ing a pistol against the elder defend
ant. Young Rosa told Judge . Mogan
that the cause of the quarrel was his
refusal to comply with his father's de
mand that he ; associate with v Italians
only, the pater having > a most unrea
sonable antipathy to American institu
tions and folk. As the young * fellow
was reared | and educated ? in this r city
he considers /himself a pretty good
American and old enough to select his
"Kid" Nash, convicted on two
charges of peace disturbance and one
of vagrancy, was given twelve months
In the County Jail by Judge Mogan.
Mr. Nash was arrested under suspici
ous circumstances in a Turk-street
apartment house, and pleaded that he
went there to visit a woman, but, like
a famous royal personage who once
was placed in a somewhat similar
predicament, resolutely declined to di
vulge the lady's name.
John Duzke and William Jarrett were
held to the Superior. Court in $2000
apiece for burglary. They were ac
cused of robbing, Joseph Brzezlnskl, a
Pacific-street saloontst, of $360, a watch
and chain and three boxes of cigars,
and 20-year-old Raynee Langford, a
danseuse, is held as a witness for the
prosecution.
Dorothy Morton, who disclaimed any
connection whatever with the bur
lesque stage, was given thirty days for
vagrancy by Judge Mogan. It was her
third conviction.
Walter Taylor, who for many months
had been employed in a position of
trust by George H. Wiegner, butcher,
1823 Point Lobos avenue, and then em
bezzled $50, was given a severe lecture
by Judge Fritz before he was dis
missed for lack of prosecution.
Mrs. Fred Leroy Lausmasser de
clined to prosecute her husband after
she had him arrested for threatening
to kill, and. of course, there was noth
ing else for Judge Conlan to dothan
dismisp the case. When the parties
left the courtroom the corridor re
sounded with their kisses, three young
ladies who had been subpenaed as
witnesses freely participating irj the
congratulatory osculation. *
> Three jurors have been secured to
try E. G. Sproat, a member of the firm
that owned Sproat's market, Avho is
before Judge Fritz on the charge of
concealing property with intent to de
fraud jtwenty-seven creditors whose
claims Aggregate J 18,000. The panel
will probably be completed to-day.
When the case of E. L. Wadham, ac
cused of embezzling $1078 intrusted
to his keeping as treasurer of the local
eyrie of Eagles, was called in Judge
Fritz's court the clerk announced
there was no complaint on file nor was
Policeman A. Jewell, who made the
arrest, present to .attend to the mat
ter. The Judge then delivered a few
remarks that were not eulogistic of
the way in which the case had been
handled by the police. Later in the
day a complaint was sworn to by Sec
retary Westcott of the Eagles. Waa
ham is under $3000 bonds. He will
be arraigned this morning.
Alexander Centre, accused of vag
rancy, declared that his arrest was a
grievous error, as for months he had
been employed at Warren's quarry and
had just come into town to spend
Saturday evening with friends when
a policeman ran him in. Judge Fritz
hearkened to the tale and then ap
,plied the hand test, finding that Mr.
Centre's palms were as soft as a
babe's. "I'll send for the foreman of
Warren's quarry." said his Honor,
and if he disproves your story I'll give
you the limit." "Then," said Mr. Cen
tre, "I guess you might as well give
it to me right now, for I've been hand
ing you a jolly." He will get it to
day.
For stealing a silken cape from a
woman of Bacon place last Friday,
concealing the garment and turning in
a false alarm of fire, James Gagan
was given nine months by Judge Con-
Ian.
â¢Joseph Baron, 19 years of age and
employed as clerk in Flotow's men's
furnishing goods store, 1033 Market
street, was charged with beating his
mother, Mrs. Rebecca Baron, last Sun
day afternoon at the family residence.
1149 Devisadero street. Policeman
Mclntyre was summoned by telephone
to the house and there found the de
fendant, who had a poker in his hand,
being held in restraint by his elder
brother, David. Mrs. Baron informed
the officer that Jacob had been in the
habit of calling her vile names and
beating her. The young man denied
he struck his mother last Sunday, but
confessed that on previous occasions
he had been so unnlial as to assault
her. Judge Mogan pronounced him
guilty as charged and will sentence
him to-day.
The battery charge was dismissed
and the agreement ordered on file.
Senora Diaz, a portly matron, ex
plained that section 2 of the unique
covenant was not uncalled for, as
Senor Diaz's susceptibility to feminine
bladishments was largely responsible
for the trouble in the Diaz household.

CONCHA R. DIAZ.
When the case of Rafael Romero
Diaz, accused of battery by^his wife
Concha, was called in Judge Fritz's
court yesterday morning the defend
ant's attorney submitted this self-ex
planatory document . and on the
strength of it asked for dismissal:
James Hagan, a striking freight
handler, was drunk and behaving in a
disorderly . manner when Patrolman
Bruce arrested him at. Fourth and
Townsend streets.
"If you are out on strike," said Judge
Fritz to the defendant, "you should
make special effort to keep sober ajid
abstain from disorderly conduct, for
you cannot help the labor cause by
losing your senses or breaking the law.
I will continue your case ten days and
would suggest that you stay away from
Fourth and Townsend streets during
that period."
Harry Stack, who was arrested for
brandishing a pistol In a rude and
dangerous manner at Kearny and Pine
streets" Saturday evening, Informed
Judge Mogan that his reason for car
rying the weapon consisted solely of
the fact that* once upon a time he was
a special policeman for a railroad cor
poration. His Hror enlightened Harry
by stating that when he ceased to be a
law officer he was deprived, of liberty
to carry concealed weapons. Sentence
will be delivered to-day.
John Oleson, who was arrested for
drunkenness Saturday night, manifest
ed considerable surprise when Judge
Fritz exhibited a warrant, alleging
battery, which was sworn to by his wife
several months ago. â¢ The woman ap
peared in court and stated that John
spends all his earnings for drftik. while
she is obliged to work as a housemaid
to provide for their three children,
which are inmates of St. Francis Di
rectory. The Judge then ordered the
husband to pay for the children's main
tenance and "warned him that failure
to do so will result in his imprisonment
for as long a term as the law allows.
May Reed is sought by Patrolman
W. J. Kavanaugh, who "has a bench
warrant for her arrest, issued yester
day by Judge Mogan. She is an old
offender who was arrested for va
grancy and. released on 510 bail, which
she forfeited, but the court ordered
that >she be brought in and compelled
to stand trial just the same.
Mrs. Joseph Brooks pleaded so piti
fully for leniency for her dishonest and
generally worthless husband that
Judge Fritz, gave him three months
instead of the six that he had earned
by stealing wool from a warehouse.
The woman stated that the man was
her only means of support, as she is an
invalid. <J
Wong Wing' and Ah Ling were
among many Chinese who disturbed
the peace Sunday afternoon at Sacra
mento and Dupont streets by infor
mally congregating and in loud and
boisterous language discussing the war
situation in Manchuria. In the court
of Judge Mogan both Wong Wing and
Ah Sing declared they were Christians
and restrained by religious scruples
from breaking the Sabbath In the man
ner described by the policeman who
arrested them. Their plea won out.
and they scurried forth chattering.
Louis Typo, a teamster, will be sen
tenced by Judge Fritz to-day for hav
ing carelessly driven his wagon into a
bicyclist at Third arid Market streets,
the collision knocking him off the
wheel and severely injuring him. What
made the matter worse for the'defend
ant was his effort; to escape without
ascertaining how badly the wheelman
was hurt, and he might have succeeded
in getting away if another teamster,
R. H. Moore, hadn't stopped him.

Harry Reardon was sampling the
luncheon in a saloon at Fourteenth and
Mission streets Saturday evening, when
Mr. Jinks and a friend facetiously
emptied two glasses of beer upon him.
With natural aversion to taking his
beer externally, Mr. Reardon picked up
a plate and hurled it at Mr. Jinks, but
the missile flew very wide of its in
tended mark and struck the face of
Joe Seidlitz as he entered the door.
Whistles were blown and when two
policemen responded one of them es
corted Mr. Seidlitz to the Receiving
Hospital to get his face patched, while
the other took Mr. Reardon to the
Southern station and booked him for
assault with a deadly weapon. The
case was called in Judge Mogan's
court, but as Mr. Seidlitz declined to
prosecute the defendant was dis
charged
George Grant and Walter Farrell
were bending over the prostrate and
inanimate form of a drunken man at
Market and Eddy streets late Saturday
night, when Patrolman James Culli
nan, sometimes alluded to as "Jimmie
the Cricket," arrested them and made
the charge vagrancy. In the shirt
bosom of the prostrate inebriate, the of
ficer informed Judge Fritz, there nes
tled a large and' glittering diamond,
and it was his opinion that if. he had
not "pinched" the defendants when he
did they would have removed the gem.
The defendants pleaded that they were
going home from a theater in which
they were employed as stage hands
when they saw the drunken individual
and charitably decided to awake him.
Just as they were about to do so, and
with no intent whatever of touching
his diamond, they were clutched by
"Jimmie the. Cricket." They were re
manded for further investigation.
