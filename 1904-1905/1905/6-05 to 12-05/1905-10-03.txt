DENVER. Oct. 2.â The spectacle of
a member of the judiciary being drag
ged about by a mob and forced to re
ccind an official order ended a day of
turmoil at Brighto(i, Colorado, the
<-ounty seat of Adams County, adjoin
ing- the city limits of Denver.
A." H. Guthicl, County Judge, haled
the Mayor. Marshal and members of
the Town Board before him this morn
ing and lectured them for their alleged
failure to enforce ordinances against
gambling and Sunday liquor selling.
Following: this, he ordered the Sheriff
end Marshal to gather the slot ma
chines In the town of Brighton and
when they reported' later" that they
could Cud only one. Judge Guthiel dep
utized two men to arrest the officer for
contempt. In the meantime both the
Sheriff and the Marshal disappeared.
The report of the Judge's action
concerning the two j>eace officers
epread through the town . and caused
much excitement. - Citizens began to
gather on the streets and' fearing for
his personal safety \u25a0 Judge Guthiel
boarded a Union Pacific freight en
gine as it was pulling a train slowly
through the town. He ordered the en
gineer to uncouple the engine from the
train, it Is said, and run to this city
with him. threatening legal action un
less the engineer complied" with the
order. The latter refused to obey the
demand and while they were discussing
the matter a mob gathered around the
engine and Judge Guthiel was dragged
from the cab.
He was told that he . must rescind
his order of arrest against the Sheriff
and Marshal and upon being assured
that he had already done so, the Judge
was released by the mob and allowed
to 'proceed to Denver on a passenger
train later. Jud^e Guthiel has, been at
W ar almost constantly with other
county officers since his administra
tion began about a year ago and has
liad tlÂ«e officials and members of the
bar before him time and again on the
charge of contempt.

BUDAPEST, Oct.. 2.â The idea is cur
rent here to-night that the political crisis
is undergoing an important development.
Minister - *of ,7 the Interior Kritbff y, ''who
originated the plan to defeat the coalition
by the introduction of measures for uni
versal suffrage, has gone to Vienna with
Premier Fejervary and Minister of Jus
tice Lahyi for an audience with the King-
Emperor to-morrow, and this has given
rise to a report that. his Majesty is ready
"to abandon his resistance to suffrage re
form,! Nothing definite, however, can be
known until after the audience. The coali
tion party is also making a new move.
Francis Kossuth, who until now ; has only
been president of the- independence' party,
wiir be elected to-morrow president of the
parties -forming the. united opposition in
(he.Diet, and^the coalition will , to-morrow
publish a stroiig protest against the Vien
nese: attitude ;toward . Hungary.

SEATTLE," Oct. 2.â The regular Great
Northern Overland train, which left
Seattle eastbound at S:2O o'clock to
night, .was held, up by a gang of ban
dits and -the express' safe dynamited
ten" miles from here. More than one
hundred shots were exchanged be
tween the bandits and the train crew.
Two boys who got on the blind bag
gage here as soon as the hold-up be
gan, entered the passenger coaches and
began holding up the passengers. They
were captured. â¢ They say two of the
: hold-up men were on the blind baggage
when they got on and a third got on
at Ballard." All were, well dressed with
raincoats and slouch hats.
-\u25a0 So far as reported no * one; has been
killed, but it- is said that Charles An
derson, the express \ ' messenger, is
silghtly .injured. \u25a0 .
Manager Waring of the Great North

not know Â«the contents' of /the safe, but

The train was flagged near the brick
yard, and as the engineer slowed up. two
-men with "â¢ rain coats climbed /..over the
tender, and presented revolvers to his
head. When the' train stopped the bag
gage and express cars were uncoupled
by one of the robbers and the engineer
was instructed to pull ahead,, which he
did for several hundred yards, when he
was again commanded to stop.
' Two of the robbers . then jumped off,
making the engineer and fireman do the
same, and all inarched to the baggage
car door. The messenger was command
edto open. the door. He refused, and an
extra heavy- charge of dynamite was
placed against it and . exploded. The - ex
plosion - tore the car .'almost to pieces.
The safe wag then dynamited. \ \u25a0
The train was delayed two hours' and a
half and then pulled Into Edmonds, mak

The two boys claim they never met the

Diplomats m Washing
ton Seem to Fear
President Castro.
Hold Conference, but Fail to
Agree Upon a Conrse
of Action.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 2.â Venezuela
and her troublous conditions are now
the subject of earnest consideration by
the Washington and Paris Govern
ments. Just from Paris with full in
structions, M. Jusserand, the French
Embassador, called at the State De
partment to-day and was in confer
ence with Secretary Root for half an
hour. Venezuela was the main sub
ject under discussion, special atten
tion being given to President Castro.
To-day's conference is the tlrst of a.
series which may be expected on this
subject and was of a preliminary na
ture. At its conclusion the announce
ment was made thi:t the Venezuelan
situation had not entered on "an im
minently critical" stage.
No course of action was agreed upon
to-day, and none 'was proposed. What
the\ relative attitude of the two ag
grieved" nations is.. toward Venezuela
was informally discussed, but pending
the investigation there which the Amer
ican special; commissioner. Judge " Cal~
hvanv is now making- on behul/ of the
Washington Government, it was not
possible for the Secretary of State-to
outline to the Kmbassador the definite
course of this country.
M. . Jusserand made it plain that
while France proposed to protect tha
rights other citizens in Venezuela, as
elsewhere throughout the world, the
French Government will continue its
; traditional policy of courteous recog
nition of . the special Interest ot this
country in a Question like this, which
affects another American republic. It
â¢is a well-known fact, not only in army
circles but throughout the diplomatic
corps, that the general staff of tha
army has been making a thorough
, special- study of Venezuela from a mll
tary standpoint, but this Government,
as well as* France, appreciates the diffi
culties of an international .expedition
to the Venezuelan capital even
should a critical turn of events war
' rant the serious consideration of such
' a movei At the same time France,
with the remainder- of the European
nations, realizes that a naval demon
stration off La Gualra, if such a course
should ever be determined on, is not
a sure, method of forcing President
Castro to yield, because of the distance
t of Caracas from the sea.
.In diplomatic circles the significance
of to-day's conference is attributed not
; so much to Its direct results, but a3
evidencing the firm purpose of the
American and French Governments, in
dividually perhaps, but none the leas
effectively, to ' protect rights of their
citizens in Venezuela. It is under
stood that France is not primarily
seeking assurances from Washington
that a French naval demonstration
against Venezuela will be approved
here,Â« though such assurance, -it <-ia
stated on high authority.' would be
vouchsafed- - What FrancÂ© - desires to
find, and thl3 desire' la thoroughly
shared by the Washington Govern
ment, is a; means, of assuring Justice
to foreigners in Venezuela. <- x
Mr. Jusserand will continue his pol
icy of discussing quite frankly with,
the .Washington Government the griev
ances of hi 3 country against Venezuela,
that there may be no misunderstanding
of the motives of the two claimant
powers.
French Company Agreeable.
CARACAS, Oct. 2.â The " Venezuelan
authorities to-day received Information
from the officials of ' the . French Cable

consents to the closing of its Caracas

ACCEPTS RESIGNATION
FOR GOOD OF SERVICE.
Lieutenant A I Har
rison is Out
of Army.
Nephew of Former
.President is Now
'; j in Disgrace.
.This resignation of Lieutenant Archi
bald Ir Harrison, nephew of the late Pres
ident "Benjamin' .-Harrison, from the
United ; States army and the con
ditions of ""its ~~ acceptance by Pres
ident . .Roosevelt have stirred \u25a0 up
much excitement In army circles here.
The officers- here "are nail guessing what
was the cause, of ,the trouble. The Presi
dent's borders i,were brief. \ They read as
follows : '"The resignation of Lieutenant
Archibald L^Harrison of the Twenty-first
Infantry; of his commission as an officer
of f the army has been accepted, to take
place from September B, 1905, for the good
of . the . seCTice."JfÂ£iÂ§jÂ£|i3l
,â¢ . It ' is the last clause, "for . the good of
the service," that causes the auery ln
military circles. What were: the actual
causes that led to this ts not known here,
but it: is rumored that financial matters
had much to do with* it. The i\ews comes
as a double surprise, as Lieutenant Har
rison had only just been ordered to report
to Major Aaron H. Appel ; at Camp Con
nell, Cabtayog, Samar, to be examined for
his promotion to captaincy. Harrison
was stationed at Bulao, Samar, when he
; sent in his resignation. The young lieu
tenant i 3 well known here, where he was
; stationed with his regiment, the Twenty
first Infantry, ! at the Presidio for some
i months prior to the departure, of those
troops for the Philippines. Harrison and
his wife occupied' handsome quarters at
the cantonment at the Presidio, where
they entertained royally. In fact, they
\u25a0 kept what might be called open house,
and tbeir^ home became a sort of a gen
eral rendezvous for the officers and ladies
'\u25a0 of the- post. '
rHarrison entered the " service of the
' army a3 second lieutenant of the Twenty
! fifth Infantry on July 9, 1858. He was pro
moted to first lieutenant of the Twenty
first Infantry September 8. 1593. He was
appointed from Missouri.

Alabama Save a Ship
mate From Drowning
I NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â A rescue, which
the officers of the' battleship Alabama
declare was one of the' most heroic that
has taken place in the navy for many
years was effected by three seamen of
that battleship .off Provincetown, Mass.,
Saturday. - . .
The man who was rescued is Andrew
Anderson, a seaman, and the men who
saved him are Edward Wagner, William
Brannon and E. V. Anderson.
The Alabama is the flagship of the
second division of the first squadron of
the North Atlantic fleet, which arrived
here yesterday. . When the order was
given to the Alabama to weigh anchor
and proceed to New York the chains
fouled the stock, and someDody had to be
lowered to untable them. The job fejl to
Anderson. . Anderson was getting aJong
-all right when the controller of the drum
around which Â» the anchor chain was âto
be wound was "released. , A minute later
the anchor, had sunk in twelve fathoms
of water and Anderson went down with
The sailor managed .to; free himself
of the rope. that was wound around his
waist. Once free, Anderson tried to rise,
to the surface. Instead of doing so he
struck the bottom of the Alabama. Three
times the sailor: tried to rise, and then he
lost consciousness. Captain W. H-^Reeder
had -signaled for full speed astern and
as soon as the Alabama had ' cleared
the spot where Anderson had gone down
the : form of the sailor appeared .on the
water.
. Wagner was the " first of the sailors to
see hlm.^ He plunged into /the sea and
swam to where the sailor was. He caught
the unconscious man : around the neck
and, swimming with one .hand.' held his
head above ? water, awaiting the. assist
ance of " Brannon \u25a0 and ,E. C. - Anderson,
who had also plunged Into the water.

TELLS OF RELATIONS

an Opportunity Was Of
fered the State Senators
to Get Some Easy Money
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 2.â E. S. Em
mons, the former Senator, charged with
accepting- a bribe, was on the witness
stand In his own behalf during the
whole of to-day. During the first hour,
\u25a0while under direct examination, Em
mons was confined to details. He was
asked by Grove L. Johnson to give his
version of conversations and Incidents
to which Harry Bunkers and Arthur
P. L<ee testified. He contradicted both
Bunkers and Lee on essential points.
On cross-examination the answers were
emphatic and earnest, and at times
even dramatic. An adjournment was
taken half an hour before the regular
time because Emmons complained of
being 111.
Although William Corbin and Clar
ence Grange were in attendance at the
session of court, there was none of the
promised inquiry into the affairs of
either the Continental or the Phoenix
Building and Loan Associations.
Attorney Johnson began the exam
ination of Emmons by asking: "Please
explain your relation with the Conti
nental Building and Loan Association
prior to the session of the Legislature
Of 1905."
Emmons state dthat in 1901 his wife
borrowed from the association $3800. The
building, he said, was partly erected and
allowed to remain in that condition for a
year because the money had run out.
TVitness stated that he ascertained that
money had been misappropriated by the
Bakersfield agent, to whom it was sent,
and that he had written to William Cor
bin asking for an explanation. He af
firmed that Corbin had called him a
blackmailer and that he had commenced
suit for accounting and an Injunction
restraining the association from proceed
ing with the sale of the property.
Emmons stated that negotiations for a
settlement, once commenced, had result
ed in another suit, brought by the asso
ciation to recover nearly $Sow, and that
this action was still pending. Emmons
affirmed that Gavin McNab was attorney
for .jia^jQHsUnental when depositions In

my way to recommend the prepara-

complaint. Before I took a course of
the treatment I had tried more than
one standard remedy, but the results,
as far as stopping the trouble, were
just as remotely in the distance as
when I first noticed that my kidneys
were out of order. A sure indication
that in some way the action of my
kidneys was upset was the too frequent
action of the kidney secretions, added
to the backache, particularly if I con-
tracted a cold. 7'or the last six months
there has not been an indication of

stated that he was not on friendly terms
with the Examiner at the beginning of
the session; that he did not solicit a place
on the Building and Loan Committee^
and that he did not .have any acquaint
ance with Wright. He had known Jordan
as a newspaper representative since IS&7.
Asked to detail the proceedings at the
first meeting of the Committee on Re
trenchments and Commissions, Emmons
said:
The meeting was called by Senator Bunkere,
the chairman who sent notices to our desks
bj" paces. WÂ« waited half an hour or mort
before we did anything, and then - proceeded
to a hasty organization. Then we adjourned.
Senator Wright was appointed secretary to
keep a rough draft of the minutes, in order
that they might be shown to the absent mem
bers of the committee. There was action
taken regarding the get-rich-quick concerns.
It was decided, too. that the newspapers
should be given the fullest information for
publicity regarding* our proceedings. We in
tended to examine every get-rich-quick con
cern and building and loan association In the
State. ,
There was no agreement to keep the othei
members of the committee misinformed as to
our doings. It was not decided who was tft
be the inquisitor, but I was suggested be
cause I had had charge of the Investigation
of the pilot commission at a previous session.
Emmons stated that T. Tuite, Charles
Hogg. Lou Martin and Arthur Lee were
on the same floor when the meeting was
held. -\u25a0
The witness . denied having said that
they could give the Missourians some
pointers or that they could get.some easy
money. He amrmed that It had been
agreed that the chairman might Issue
eubpenas without calling the committee
in meeting. He added that they had de
termined to wait for complaints.
Emmons denied that Jordan's name had
been mentioned at the meeting or that
there had been any talk about getting all
they could. He also contradicted the
statement to the effect that the four ex-
Senators had shaken hands and agreed to
share alike. He declared that he never
received any money and denied all the
accusations of the witnesses for the pros
ecution. "
HIS JPLACB OX COMMITTEE.
Emmons declared that he did not seek a
place on the Committee on Commissions ;
and Retrenchments, although he did ask
Lieutenant Governor Anderson to. ap
point him on three other' committees,
which he named.
The witness then told of having known
French, Wright, Bunkers and Jordan,;
telling how long he had known each one.;
Emmons then related the proceedings '
leading to the, organization of the com
mittee, and denied t all â the statements
made by Bunkers tn his confession deal
ing with* this subject. *He denied' that he
had said that J. W. Vaughn should be^
appointed stenographer to the committee
because he could handle him. He stated
that the reason he named Vaughn ; was
because the latter had reported the pilot
investigation of the preceding session and
had done excellent work. \u25a0
Johnson took > Emmons, question by

Bunkers, every section of which Emmons
denied positively. j. :_ ' '\u25a0'

Harry Corbett and Colonel

Before Grand Jury and

Five Assemblymen willXbe indicted
by the Grand Jury of ' .'Sacramento
County within a few .days for accept
ing bribes to vote' down the rÃalstonr Ralston
anti-prizefight bill. Several local
sporting men who raised and distribu
ted * the corruption/ fund may s also be
indicted. Harry Corbott, Colonel Brady
and others of the local sporting fra
ternity will be subpenaed by the Grand
Jury at Sacramento. . ,
"Billy"- Nolan, the .manager of Bat
tling Nelson, was before the Grand
Jury yesterday and told how ,he had
been approached to contribute to * the
fund. Assemblyman Fayette Mltchel
.tree, who led the fight against the
Ralston bill, :.as already given District
Attorney Seymour of Sacramento posi
tive evidence against five Assembly
men. He declares that he is morally
certain that many more were bribed,
but he has unassailable proof against
nve. â¢ " . 'â¢ . \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 â¢::.\u25a0.\u25a0\u25a0 â¢
Who these five are, Mitcheltree posi
tively refuses to say. He has been ad
vised by Seymour to say nothing.
Mitcheltree also refuses to tell who
passed out the money. "But it was pass
ed out all right," he declared. "I know
who did the passing and who took the
money."'
Mitcheltroe's stand is. peculiar. ' He
admits that he learned soon after he
became active against the Ralston bill
that there was "something doing,"
meaning that the corruptionists were
abroad chinking bagsful _of twenties
and rattling crisp banknotes. Mitchel
tree said nothing at the time, however,
nor did he ever intend to say.' anything
about the crooked work until it af
fected him.
"I wouldn't be a squealer,", he said. "I
would never holler, but I had ; to vindi
cate myself. The inference was open that
I was a bribe-taker, because I worked so
hard against the Ralston bill.' I never got
a cent." \u25a0'...-'
"How much money was paid to these
CAsstmtlynrien-?'-' was asked.
""' PRICES' OF ASSEMBLYMEN.
"Oh, some got as high as $300, others
got as low as J50," v.*as the reply. "Some
of them_got thelr^coin .at:
The rest? of ; them got "their, shares ? when
.they landed iM: San Francisco." " V
' "Did you know that jthe money was
boing passed out whew you voted: against
the Ralston bill?" , was asked. ;
"Yes, but I was leading the ; fight and
I had toTstay with it.' I have /lots of
lighting blood and I am not a quitter." :
This !s the;admission that puts Mitchel
tree in a peculiar light.. He knew that
wholesale boodling ', was going on. and the
only reason he 'gives 'for not .exposing it
is that, he did 'not want to be regarded
as a, "squealer." .
When the thing was brought home to
him, -when the people in his own town
began to whisper that he had "got his
bit," Mitcheltree decided to do what he
should have done in the first place^ Had
it not been for the talk andâ possiblyâ the
actions ;of "Billy" Nolan, Mitcheltree
would never ; have spoken:
He is anxious to re-establish himself
in the community where he lives. "It is
the only -way I can do it." he says. "To
tell everything 1 know."
._\u25a0> "Is the evidence you have against these
five Assemblymen â¢ as strong as the evi
dence against Bunkers, French, Wright
and- Emmons?" was asked.
"Oh; '!a whole,, lot stronger," . replied
Mitcheltree. \u0084"1 have it all. complete.'. 'lt
was a whole , lot easier . to get than the
evidence in the. other case." . . .
Mitcheltree . maintains that he took the
stand against .the . Ralston bill "just be
cause he thought he was. right." â¢
-. "Alex Greggains came to me in Sacra
mento," he, said/ "and wanted me to

A family named Camara started the

that a woman in her night clothes and H
'with "long/ black hair falling over a ;

slipped into bed between two young '
girls." This happened twice according j
to their story the second time the !
terrified folk took refuge with an
American family.
' The! panic quickly spread and the
Portuguese now refuse to enter the

A peculiar thing about the matter is i
the statement of two reputable Ameri- i

CANDIDACY 0F JOHN S. PARTRIDGE FOR

Organization of tlieiiewly; a ppo to-morrow and the great cam

RUEFS HENCHMEN INDORSE
UNION LABOR TICKET.
Gangsters Take Name^of^inyependent
Republicansin This Campaign-
Fully 600 .persons, including delegates
I and policemen, were present last night at
i the Ruef Republican Convention at' the
Alhambra Theater to indorse the men
placed on the . Union Labor ticket and
listen to the flourishesof oratory of A^bra
j ham Ruef and his men. VThe, indorsing of
the ticket occupied but -one minute,* while
the numerous 'speeches i of the delegates
consumed the, rest of the evening. The
outcome of a fathef sjubdued and funereal
convention, despite the* presence vt -the
band, was the indorsement r of the ticket'
headed by Schmitz, the ratification ot.tHe
Unio'ri Labor platform and the adoption
of a resolution" urging, the _ convention .to
secure the necessary signatures bo -.that
the ticket may be placed on the ballot
as that of the -Independent Republicans.
After a delay of nearly three-quarters !
of an hour the minority delegates of the
Ruef wing of the Republican forces were
called to order ) by Myrtile Cerf. . tem
pcrary chairman* of the "rump" conven
tion. - .
The actual strength, or rather weak
ness, of the Ruefltes was concealed by the
presence of'many spectators among the
delegates of the ,Ruef districts. Cerf in
defining the cause of the meeting said:
As actirur chairman I have called together
tele large delegation to voice the sentiment
' existing in the Republican: party adverse to
the action of the recent local convention in
"fusing" with the Democratic party and In
, sacriftcinf party nominations, party principle*
' *nd party policies and to, protest against the
1 alienation Irom our party of the great massen
or its fighting strength, the voters upon whom
It has always relied for its electoral successes,
the wageworkers iof the community. This
con\-Â«nt!on, insisting of 800 delegates. Is tno
iargeÂ»t local convention ' which has . ever \u25a0 been
held ln^San Ftancisoo. and the strong attend
ance', show* ' the deep Interest in ; the present
political situation.' ' - ' â¢ .
Believing that the action of the local Re- |
publican Convention has tended to disrupt our I
! party and its organisation In San;v Francisco,
and further believing that â¢ the so-called
â¢â¢fusion" ticket is the result of absolute bar
gain and sale, this meeting has been called.
I Tbla convention's duty will be to recommend
and nominate a ticket for the suffrage of the
I voten of San Francisco who do not believe in
I the swallowing up of the Republican party by
a handful of Democrats. After such recom
rnendation and nomination a petition will be
circulated and the nam^s will be placed on
the official ballot. The name suggested for
' the ticket Is; -'Independent. Republican." .
t i :" KASE TAKES ! CHAIR. . - - ,
Daniel Coleman of the Forty-first Dis
trict, who was the Ruef nominee for
chairman '61 -Ihe -Republican convention,
\u25a0 then eulogtetically nominated Ruef s Ueu
! tenant. Thomas K. Kase, for permanent
I chairman of the convention. The>.nom
j inatlon was duly seconded. John Me- ;

marks were received with perfunctory ap
plause by the delegates. He promised to
recognize the delegates as they arose and
to give each a hearing. He denied that
there was any. program prepared and in
vited any .delegate -to "break the slate."
He strenuously called attention to the al
leged failure ,of- the conference commit
tee to report to the .Republican conven
tion. -':\u25a0â¢:â¢ -.- ;

by Cerf that Â§00- delegates were present, j

and contributed a long speech denning

A recess of five minutes was then taken
to enable Chairman -Kase to name a com
mittee of eighteen to be the committee'
on organization and action. John Whit
ney next contributed a resolution and: ten-:
minute speech, declaring that the minor-,
ity of the Republican 'convention in real
ity composed the majority from the al

majority, of {he "Republican voters. ;"'â¢ '
SHOUTS VFOR l RUEF.
\ According to arrangement' a chorus was
then started fora speech from Ruef. He
was accorded the ? floor 'by a rising vote,
escorted to the platform: and introduced
as the foremost Republican of California.
;Half of Ruef's , speech" 'was devoted to
scoring of the Citizens' Alliance and half
to the generous roasting of the public
press. Compared with the bosV defense
littered some weeks ago at the Alhambra.
last. night's tirade was simply gentle and
amusing. Ruef's f speech was entirely
suited to his audience, and for an hour
the boss Continued ' his*' efforts to get
newspaper advertising.
At the 'conclusion of/ the speech Ruef,
and Schniitz were "cheered. A. H. Pow

committee of eighteen, read the commit

Mayor JMakes Three Ad
dresses at Halls; in Differ
ent Sections of the City
MaYor Eugene E. Schmitz opened the j
campaign for the Union Labor party last
night with striking vigor. He made three
speeches In different sections of the city
and everywhere he was â¢ received with
great enthusiasm. He drove 'from, place
to place In a single" carriage with hi 3 I
brother," ; Frank, . and ', was j, pulled . by the i
same speedy white - horse, that has car- :
rled him through two "campaigns. Other,
candidates of. the \ Union Labor party
spoke during the evening. |
Schmitz pointed with pride to the four
years of municipal history, since .he took
command. He scored <the recent Grand
Jury as a "packed body of hired .spies/,
and in even more severe. terms arraigned
the Citizens* Alliance. He declared that
the . Republican League was controlled' by
this organization and that the Democrats
had, sold themselves, out.
The largest; crowd' of .the evening
greeted the Mayor a{ the Potrero Opera
house. This was the .first; address made
last night. ;"I \u25a0 chose, to open here," he
said, "because, four years ago your, dis
trict gave me my largest .votei and . I
wanted 'encouragement for * the coming
campaign. ." Ever_. since * I .came "into " the
political field I have;never had Tone fear :
of defeat, because :I knew that you,, the.
bone and sinew. -of this, city, were behind
me. ,1 have been attacked on" every hand,,
yet I : have had no fear.* -A. packed Grand
Jury spent the people's money^ lllegitlT
mately when it hired experts and detec
tives "at an enormous cost to investigate
my affairs." It went; through the admin
istration with a fine tooth comb,' yet was
forced to retire ; without | having placed
one linger on , a dishonest. .'act."/.." . '
j J. J. McTiernan was the president I of
this meeting and introduced the speakers.
W.- H. Langddn. Charles 'Boston, James'
de Succa and Thomas F. Egan spoke
briefly. ,
An enthusiastic house/greeted the
Mayor at Teutonla Hail, on Howard
street. "There Is more,' interest in this
than in any other campaign In years,"
he said. "There is also a great principle
at stake.' The coming fight is clearly be
tween the plain people and ; the ; Citizens'.

RUSH MATTERS
AT CONVENTION
Lidependent Democratic
; Party Adopts Union Labor
Platform and Adjourns
About thirty persons attended" the con
vention of the Independent Democratic
party, which met last night at 102 O'Far
rell street to adopt a platform and select
npmlneers for the coming municipal elec
tion..;^. .. . ...
The meeting had hardly been called to
order when a motion was carried t,to ad
. Journ. They found enough time to adopt
the rjlatf orra of. the Union Labor party
and promise to support their nominees
at " the coming election. S. Cornell was
selected chairman and Richard R. Cun
, ningham secretary. . . Another resolution
I was adopted to place- on the -ballot an
Independent - Demooratic ticket. A mo
, tion was then carried to adjourn .and the
1 crpwd left the hall and promise to assem
ble again when the chair saw flu
The following platform was adopted: ;
' To the Independent Democratic Party " of the
" City and County of San Francisco. State
of California: . . i
.Tour committee,, appointed to confer with
the Union Labor party with a view 6f select
ing nominees for office to be voted for at the
ensuing election, respectfully presents the fol
lowing report: - â¢
Certain -. gelf-conatituted "bosses'* of thÂ»
Democratic party, by forming a perfidious and
un-Dembcratic alliance with | the Republican
party and its allied corporate- Interests, hava
In a great measure destroyed the identity and
Integrity of the local Democratic party. This
act of treachery, inspired solely by a desire
to secure' political patronage and the dlspensa-
tion of political. jobs, has made it difficult, if
not impossible, for the Independent Democratia
party, with' any hope of sucprss, to select and
place before the citizens of San Francisco at
the ensuing election a ticket composed en
tirely of Democrats.
Your committee believes that the Union
Labor party is -more thoroughly democratic
and in accord with Democratic principles than
the hybrid Republican-Democratic "fusion"
party which . has lately sprung into being.
For that reason your committee respectfully
recommends that \u25a0 the Independent ' Democratic
party indorse and select as Its candidates the
nominees of 'the Union Labor Convention, held
in this city on the 30th day of September. 1905.
:Many of the said nominees are stanch and
unswerving Democrats, - who - hold dear trie
precepts and traditions lof true Democracy.
TbOÃe of the said nominees who are not Dem
ocrats In name are, 'at- least. Democrats In
principle, since they have espoused the cause
of -the toilers.- who constitute the bone and
sinew -of true Democracy. Respectfully sub
mitted. . MATTHEW O'BRIEN.

The following resolution was adopted:
' ResoH-ed, E That I the Independent Democratic

There is etill some hope for saving the

underwriters call It, and they are pre,
paring to put up as good a fight as the
equipment at their disposal will allow.

shadow of Fort Point
Diver Abrakamson made an Investiga
tion yesterday of the conditions under

inside the vessel, his way being barred by
an Intricate network of pipes, through
which he could not thread his way, ham
pered as he was by the cumbersome div-
Ir.g costume and the air tubes connect

afternoon he went down outside and
walked around the stranded liner. His
report put heart into the underwriters,
and if the weather holds fair they have
some hope of succeeding In getting the
Alarneda off. far, the hull does not ap

CHICAGO, Oct. 2.â Reckless auto

scathingly yesterday by the Rev. P. J.
McDonnell, speaking from the pulpit of
St. Mel's Roman Catholic Church, Wash

Father McDonnell's utterances were
prompted by an accident almost at the

Hannon, a widow seventy-two .years
old. was run down by a machine.* She
was crossing the street to enter the
church, of which she is a member. , Her
injuries were severe and she was car
ried to the priest's house.
JT. : IT. Eustace, owner of the car,
stopped and gave what aid he could

strong that she may be floated Into deep
water. \u25a0
The Oceanic Steamship Company has
turned over the ship to the underwriters.
TLe latter held a meeting yesterday aft
ernoon and decided to leave the efforts
for saving the liner in the hands of Cap
tain Plllsbury and Captain j Metcalfe,
Plllsbury representing the local insurance
Interests and Metcalfe the British insur
ance companies.
The underwriters say that as a busi
ness proposition^ it might pay them better
to leave the Alameda where she is, . but
that local pride and sentiment combine
to make them unwilling to have It re
corded that they abandoned a fine liner,
almost In the harbor, without turning a
hand to save her.
All depends now upon the weather. The
work of discharging the vessel has not
stopped since Saturday afternoon, and
there will be no resting until the Ala
meda either comes floating home or is
abandoned to the elements.

Ine wrecked coasting steamer Santa
Barbara, is -being slowly towed* "to this
port by theT'omo.' She was last, sighted
at 8 o'clock yesterday morning by the
Centralla. At that time the Santa Bar
bara Was very low in the water and the
Porno was making 'slow progress with
her. helpless tow. They were fifty miles
south of Point Arena when seen by the
Centra Ha. . -
The Santa Barbara's bottom" was badly
damaged by the sharp rocks near Del Mar
and there Is some danger that Â» she may
never reach port. When the. passengers
were taken from her, her engine-rooms
were flooded and water was pouring into
her almost 86 if she had been a sieve.
It is evidently all that the crew of four
left on her, with the help of men from the
Porno, can do to keep her from sinking.
Should anything like a squall, set . In, the
Santa Barbara would have to be aban
doned.
, The steam schooner Vanguard, which
sighted the Porno and her tow at 6 yes- j
terday morning, reports that they were i
making very poor progress, though the
sea "was smooth as glass. . At that time
it seemed to those on the Vanguard. that
the decks of the Santa Barbara were
awa6h. The Santa Barbara was ' then
eighteen miles northwest of ; Point Reyes.
The Santa Barbara went ashore at 4:30
Del Mar. The sea was calm and the day,
according to members of the crew, was
unclouded. The little vessel evidently
tried to hug the shore too closely and
struck upon some hidden rocks. Second
Mate Arthur Self was on watch when
she jammed hard and fast upon the
jagged reef. \
The passengers were asleep at the time
and at the first alarm there was a wild
scramble to the decks. Captain Frank
Zaddart ran out .of his stateroom and
took in the situation in an instant. He
calmed j the frightened passengers land
quickly restored. order- '.
An effort was made to back the vessel
off, but she was jammed hard and fast,
and the water -was rushing in' through
her punctured bottom. In a. few. minutes
the fires. were. out and .the vessel settled
low in the water. .' ;_; _
The passengers were .taken . ashore
through a rough surf in lifeboats'. Wet
and cold, they waited until the Porno
and the Sea Foam arrived. < They were
brought to this port by the Sea Foam.'
The Porno. the Phoenix and the Punta
Arena passed hawsers. to the Santa Bar
bata and tried to pull her off. After
several ineffectual, attempts they sue"
ceeded.- . ."â¢ .-. ;- . ... . -,'.,.;,;
,It is. thought that the Santa Barbara i
will reach port some time this morning,
barring mishaps.

Trial of X. Bobbins Develops
Fact That His Confederate
Fired Shots and Escaped
DIJNNE GIVES. ACCOUNT
W- L. Gleason Furnishes
Description of Affair as
He Saw It From a Window
OAKLAND. Oct. f.â The story of a
midnight shooting at the corner of
Thirteenth and Clay streets on the
sight of June 11 was narrated before
Judge Henry Melvin and a jury in the
criminal department of the Superior
Court to-day at the trial of Lee.Rob
bins, charged with being implicated in
an attempt to kill Frank Dunne. A
third man. with a light overcoat, who
made his escape from the scene of the
shooting, is said to have been the man
who sent a bullet through Dunne's
cheek, but only Robbins knows who
the man is and he won't telL
According to the story told by
Dunne to-day on the stand lie and Rob
bing had had several quarrels and on
the night in question Robblils and a
man unknown to him attacked him
near the Gas. Company's office and
while Robbins held him his companion
fired two shots at him at close range,
Rt)bbins calling. to his friend to "plug
him." The story of the struggle as
seen by \V. I* Gleason, dramatic critic,
from his windows at the Hotel Tou
raino is new ia tho case and confirms
the belief that a third man fired the
shot. Tho prosecution takes the
gTound- that Robbins was a principal
before the fact. Mr. Gleason's story
follows:
My wife and ' I were preparing for bed
ebcut 12:aO 9' clock when I heard a. *hot- I
was Quite close to the window, to I opened the
ahutter, ard right down Clay street, under an
electric light at the corner of Thirteenth street.
I jsaw tbree men. Two T".ad hold o", each oth
er's anas and were ajs:>&rently etruKSHn*.
while the third man circled around them as a
referee would at a prizefight. I fancy he
went around them about three time* when I
aaw him suddenly step up on tie sidewalk and
deliberately are at one of the men's heads.
Both men drooped to the ground, and I saw
people Ixrin to father, and the tnan with tbe
lUrfct overcoat snd one of the. men who had
been In the struggle came right up Clay street
toward me. Kubbina stej>x>ed Into the door
way of the Methodist Church and was arrested
by Policeman Mulgrew, but the man with the
light overcoat came across Fourteenth 6treet
right under my window. I called to the oo
licesian and said to hlni: "You have the
wrong man there. The rann who did the shoot
ing is going up the street." He. however. I
gueÂ«.s. thought he had the right man and did
Dot believe me. and the man got away.
Both Robbins and Dunne are well
known young men about town and
there is considerable speculation as to
whether Robbins will be put on the
Etand to testify in his own behalf and.
If he does, what explanation he will
make as to who his companion was on
the night Dunne was shot:

Y. M. C. A. HALL
BERKELEY, Oct.' '2.â Arrangements have
been made by the Voting Men's "Christian Asso
ciation men of the State University and of
j Stanford for a Joint reception to bÂ« given on
the n!fM of the freshman football game, a
week from next Saturday. The suggestion that
â¢ such a reception be held- was given by Secre
tary J. G. White of California and received
the approval of the Stanford men at once.
Htilt-s Hall will be the ecene of the affair.
Stanford footbal! players will speak and Cali
fornia men will make short talks. A large
reception committee, made up of California stu
dents. Is to be appointed. The hail will be
decorated In the colors of both universities.
Refreshments will be provided and an abund
ance of music.
The song and yell committee announces that
ihe new song bock will be distributed next
week.
The R. A. Roos challenge punting cup. pre
sented to the association Etudent body by R.
A. Roos, '04, has been put on exhibition at tbe
co-operative store on the campus. The cup is
* fine silver trophy, fifteen inches high. Three
buckhorn handles are on the sides. Each year
there is to be inscribed on the cup the name
of the champion punter of the team and his
punting distance. The year of each contest up
to 1914 is engraved on one side of the cup
now, and after that year the names and dates
will be inscribed on the other sides of the cup.
The freshman class will elect officers to
morrow. A scrimmage 1b expected, as the
coponomorcs hold it to be their inalienable
right to "rough house" the under-class men on
thi* occasion. There will be but one contest
. among candidates, as the class has nominated
only one person for the offices, with the ex-
oeptlon of the vice presidency. For that place
Miss Edith Brown and Miss Florence Jackson
are candidate*. The other officers nominated
ere: C. A. O'Connor, president; Helen Pink
ham, secretary: Robert Shuey, treasurer; F. Q.
Stanton. perareant at arms.
Somi-offlcial notice was given the sopoho
znores to-day by the faculty that they would
be held strictly to account for any property
destroyed in the rush that is anticipated : to
morrow.

AUTOING DEVELOPS
SERIOUS ILLNESS.
Brings Sp>inaK :Men
i ingitis 'Attack to
J.B.John.; :-;'r
Doctors Say Excess
\u25a0 ive "Bubbling"
Is Cause.
[ OAKLAND. Oct. 2.â At death's dooKbe
cause of too "much, too rapid ' and too
recKiess automobillng is the' condition of
J. B. John, a well-known, young business
and club man of .this city. 1 It is not
through any accident . or wreck that Mr.
John's dangerous condition has arisen, but
constant riding and the Jolting and Jar
ring of the machine, in passing over car
tracks and. chuckholes in the street has
developed spinal meningitis. j
Mr. John began to feellll on Thursday
last and was compelled to go to his room
in the Hotel Metroyole, where he called
Dr. M. M. Enos. Dr.. Enos j pronounced
the attack one of spinal meningitis â¢ and
put him to bed with a trained nurse in
charge of the case. ( Yesterday the casTj
took a eudden" and- extreme, turn for the
worse and for a time life was despaired
of. Dr. Enos called Dr. W. .S. Porter
Into consultation and Dr. Porter agreed
with the diagnosis" of Dr. Enos. To-day
the patient was a little better, but is far
from out of danger.
Dr. Enos attributes Mr. John's condition
entirely to the excessive use of his auto
mobile, .jvhich has, by the Jar, disturbed
the nerves and the circulation' of. the
blood so as to bring on this result. This
is what Dr. Enos said of the case to-day:
I attribute Mr. John's condition to reckless
and excessive U6e of his automobile. H* wiÂ»
constantly riding about in . his machine and
he did not pay proper attention to crossing
tracks and looking out for holes In the atrent.
His machine was a short runabout and there
ia more jar to the short than to the long ma
chines. The result was that he constantly
subjected his system to Jar and Jolt until
this condition has arisen.
Mr John told me that one day last week
be was compelled to make a sudden turn to
avoid a bugry. and In so doing struck the
curb not hard enough to break, the machine,
but hard enough to give him a jar. That
Jar turned him tick, but he recovered enougn
to continue with his work. Later, a few
days before he was taken down, he was
nibking \u25a0 a trip to Berkeley and crossed the
tracks of the Key route at Fortieth stree.
at -a high rate of speed. The Jolt of th:s
croielng made him so eick that he was com
pelled to turn around and come home.
EverythinÃ points to the automobile as be
ing the cause of his condition. \u25a0 .
Mr. John is a very popular young man.
a member of the Nile Club and connected
with the real estate firm of A. J. Snyder
& Co.

YOUNG SARGENT
IN SAN PLIGHT
Student Wounded by Officer
May Liye, but His 5 Memory
Is Probably Gone Forever
FATHER VISITS HIM
Broken Parent Says His Boy's
Anxiety to Gain Educa
tion Ma^de Him a Thief
OAKLAND/ Oct. ; 2.â There is now no
doubt that Earl A. Sargent, the univer
sity student whp was shot yesterday
morning by Policeman McCready while
trying to escape from, the officer, was v a
kleptomaniacâ a thief without j the reason
for so being. While: traveling with peo
ple of high moral, character and having a
home with his parents, who are : in com
fortable if â¢ not opulent circumstances, , if
he wished it young Sargent seemed unable
to keep from stealing. He seemed stu
dious and ambitious and his professors
liked him. The articles taken were none
of them of great value/, Among \ them
were t books ; from libraries, guns, tools
and bicycles. There has been no apparent
effort to dispose of these articles \ for
money, and even the police , have come
to . the belief that he stole because he
could not help it.
The whole; story came out to-day, when
Sargent was identified as a student who
entered the State University at Berkeley
something over a -year ago, giving his
name as Earl Arthur Sargent. When'he
was arrested |in j San Jose he reversed
these initials and called himself simply
A. E. Sargent. Probation ' Officer. Decoto
to-day identified Sargent as a young man
he had known when a,t college and who
had got into trouble . in Berkeley from
stealing some : tools ' fnom a . man
named Dallerup while Sargent was try
ing to work: his way through the univer
sity, and. who was' nominally, under his
care as probation officer with the charge
of the theft of the tools still hanging
over his head.
AUTHORITIES SYMPATHETIC.
The theft of the tools by. Sargent at
Berkeley a, year ago caused a great deal
of interest at the time. Sargent had borne
the best kind of a reputation and was
known as a .studious boy who was trying
to earn a little toward hls.expenses while
at college. As a result there was a great
deal of sympathy for him, and when it
was found that he had stolen a number
of things of not very great value the uni
versity authorities interested themselves
in his case and secured his release upon
probation. For a. while all went well, but
his usefulness at the State institution was
gone and he transferred to Stanford and
had Just completed his tests for entrance,
hoping to complete the education that he
longed for. BUt he .could not overcome
the. desire to steal, and the story of how
he stole the. bicycle, which was his largest
theft, his escape in San Jose and his
flight and shooting in. .Oakland has been
told. â¢â¢ . - ' â¢; fJyiaV *>$} r. : i *-rJ \u25a0' \u25a0'
Sargent's kleptomaniac--- tendency was
further shown this \u25a0 afternoon, .: when
the homevof his parents^at Berkeley
was searched and aÂ£ ; lot- of, miscellan
eous.-articles, \u0084 reco,vered, â¢ -including
abouÂ£ $100 worth of (books, , many from
the State". Universinty. . library, j a rifle,
tools and other, articles. . \u25a0;
J. C. Sargent, the father of .the boy.
called at the, hospital this morning and
identified,., his son.-. The. latter^ lay on
a- cot witha policeman on guard. The
meeting .was most pathetic, ; for parent
.and son recognized, each other at once.
The boy tried to . speak,, but that por
tion, of his brain which' controls the
memory of words is gone, and he was
only able to utter, a few disjointed syl
lables.The â¢ father, a grizzled miner,
with all the evidences of a hardy con
stitution, staggered and would have
fallen had it not been for a hospital
assistant, 'who 'caught jhim and almost
carried ; him to a chair. "
"Oh,: myi poor ; boy. 5 It, has come to
this," moaned the old man.
.;, â¢FATHER IS
The â¢ father \u25a0. i seemed-, /completely
crushed bythe injury to his; boy and
the disgrace. -He did hot ; want to talk
and was so broken that he did not ask
about the crime with which his son
was charged. .He is'inclined to lay all
the trouble to an inordinate ambition
to get an . education . that | seemed to
possess his son. . Mr. Sargent : said:
My | boy always wanted { to , get a : complete
education.. When we lived in 'Oregon he
worked in the mines as a carpenter and in any
way to put himself -through the college there.
Then .he wanted to go through the university
at Berkeley .and we came to live in that city.
My r work kept â¢me away from - home a great
deal and Earl 1 ived. with his mother. ;, He did
not want to burden us too much and so worked
his way through the college there until he got
Into his first trouble.. He found ; that what he
had done hurt him* at Berkeley, and 'so he de
termined . to go *to Stanford. \u25a0He left - : home
last Wednesday to complete his work, at that
institution, and wrote me on Friday ' that he
had successfully entered, and . that he .would
be back at the end -of the . week. The next I
knew was when I read the story of the shoot-
Ing in \u25a0 the papers. - Of- course .1 knew â¢ that it
was my boy and so came to the hospital. \u0084
\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Young Sargent never exhibited his
kleptomaniac tendencies until he came
to Berkeley and so his . father , believes
that his. ambition to get an education
made him a. thief. . \
Young Sargent will , probably '2 not
die, j but . so I much of his . brain ; is gone
that he can never be normal' again., At
present he has all; of theipower,rieces
saryjto talk, but ;hls memory of words
is? gone. > There r are^ Indications that
he is trying to say something, but that
he ; cannot find the .words j necessary to
f ranie . his thoughts o- ideas. \u0084

will never,' : be normal again,",. sa.id; Dr.

J. R. KNOWLAND
IN A RUNAWAY
On Saturday last- Congressman Joseph
\u25a0R. Knowland and his wife of Alameda fig
ured in a runaway accident on the road
leading from-- King- dty to- Mission- San
Antonio -dc Padua, In Monterey County.
TLey â¢< narrowly escaped serious injury or
death. â¢ â¢^
â¢ That the'young Congressman and his
wife were not seriously injured seems
miraculous, as both were thrown out, and
over an embankment.* As It was, a se
vere shaking up and -a few aching bones
are the only physical evidences of the
mishap, and both are wondering how they
escaped bo fortunately.
The accident occurred as Mr. Knowland
was driving to the old mission, whither
he was going to start the work of restor
ation upon It. The- upset, however, did
not disrupt his plans, and before leaving
there on Monday morning he had several
men at work rebuilding the vestibule roof
that fell during the winter, and safe
guarding" the great adobe walls that the
Landmarks League caused to be rebuilt
two' years ago.
The work at that time came to a stand
still;' owing to a scarcity of funds, but
matters are brightening for the future of
the old landmark and Mr. Knowland has
determined '? to finish the urgent repairs
before returning to Washington..

According to Lachance's testimony

Revolver. *
Frederick R. oimedo, a barber, living
at 744 Bush street, was held up about 9-13
o'clock last evening by three masked men
at the corner of Central avenue and
Haight street. The robbers secured $6 in
cash and a $25 gold watch and disap
peared down Haight street.
Oimedo was standing on the corner
waiting for a car when the robbers ap
peared. The foremost presented a re
volver at his head and commanded him
to throw up his hands. He Immediately
complied with the request, but the foot
pads were not taking any chances, and
the second one also drew a revolver* while
the third went through Olmedo's pockets.
The robbers were evidently ' novices
at their - trade, for they neglected to
take a revolver which Oimedo had in
his hip pocket, and after they had se
cured $6 and his gold watch they turn
ed and fled down Haight street. OlinedoJ
immediately fired three' shots at the fu-^
srltives and at the same time began s
blowing his police whistle.
An excited crowd gathered, but as no
policeman was in sight, some one vol
unteered to telephone to the Park sta
tion. Sergeant Boyd, who was in
charge of the Park station, regarding
the story as fishy, refused to send a
man to the scene, saying that the story
did hot; sound good to him.
It was twenty-flve minutes later when
Policeman Dougherty arrived at the
corner, -where the excited crowd was
still discussing the hold-up.

ALCAZAR THE \TER, AND WHICH SERVED TO INTRODUCE TO MANY SAN FRANCISCANS THREE J SPLENDID ACT
ORSâCHARLES WALDRON. LUCIA MOORE AND HENRY SHUMER. , *
They have an astonishing little pro
duction of "The Eternal City" at the
Alcazar this week, the occasion the in
troduction of the new stock leaders,
Charles Waldron and Miss Lucia Moore.
"Splendid haÂ» been worn out on worse
things- The pictures are particularly
pood, that of the g-arden of the Vatican
being handsome to a degree, and all of
the settings fit and adequate. In fact

Itself and for a week to week produc
tion last night's "Eternal City" could
hardly be betteredâ one notable in
etar.ee in the cast excepted. But the
actors, even to "Johnny" Maher as the
Pope Pius XII, fitted easily into their
roles, and the performance went like
clockwork. There were others besides
Mr. Bcleeco who claimed the produc
tion a better one than that brought
here by E. J. Morgan.
Very actable stuff is "The Eternal
City," and chromollthographlo, unsubtle
es it is, the play has the quality of hold
ing the attention. It could hardly have
been bettered (apparently) as a medium
for the new leading man, Charles Wal

counted with. His Rossi discovered him

| as a player of personality and distinc
tion and excellent actorlal technique.
! Mr. Waldron's voice is not one of his
J least assets, and he has a face rich in
I possibilities. As Rossi'a it is quite re
; markable in Its garment of expression,
picturing with admirable fidelity the
ascetic, the enthusiast, the fanatic of the
play.
Mr. Waldron had not the best chance
in the world last night to show what he
could do as a lover. Miss Moore's Roma
being not to say inspiring. Then he
i doe* some after White Whittlesey, and
lit is hard to come after Whittlesey
: here! We shall ho^e to see him later.
I But in all his scenes Mr. Waldron show
' ed power, ease, a grateful sense of re
j straint as well as characteristic grip,
i and there is seemingly no doubt that
j the Alcazar has been exceedingly lucky
]in its choice of a leading man.
' Whether the role happens to nt unusu
! ally well remains to be seen. It can be
; seen next week, when the actor appears
â¢in "What Happened to Jones." What
! happens to Mr. Waldron will interest.
! Miss Moore is rather another story.
\u25a0Perhaps the role of Rona does not fit
iher. She seemed. to think it did. I
â¢ don't know. Just where Miss Moore's
\u25a0 "I-shall-always-be-ter-rue" style of
elocution does fit â these days â is
i rather difficult to determine. Kremer
â¢ calls for it perhaps, and perhaps as a
; black alpaca heroine Miss Moore "be
j longs." She was overmelodramatlc
I even for Mr. Calne's ripe, red melo
| drama, and of the stock, stocky. She
does things â as the children sayâbe
cause she "haster." not because she
must. There is not the slightest ele
ment of spontaneity in the work. One
could believe that Mist Moore counts
her steps as she doles out her wordsâ
possibly most of this, as before said,
because the role is ungrateful to her,
I partly, of course, by reason of the first
j night nervousness. But Miss Moore, so
] far. Is not particularly promising.
The rest of the cast held many bits of
good work. \u25a0 Par Â«ft;ularly effective Is Fred
Butler's Bruno Rocco, sincere," robust and
powerful throughout. Almost very good
Is Henry Shumer, who has beÂ©nÂ« imported
from the Central to play Baron Bonelli.
Mr. Shumer brought his villain's, tall hat
with him, but otherwise " there was '\u25a0 no'
trace of the Central in his careful and
thoughtful study of Mr. s Caine's. Scarpia.
It is really rather a mild brand of villain,
and might be horrider with advantage.
Much interest naturally centered
upon the figure -of the Pope, that' Mr.
Maher's thin nose and: chin * probably
brought his way. The make-up: is ex
traordinary, the porcelaip skin and the
rest of the, familiar features being cap
itally reproduced, and beyond a little
over-shaking of the head, Mr. Mah.er
does nothing to discredit- the make-up.
Mr. Byers is as good, -as Father Plf
feri; Ruth Allen effective- as -Rocco's
wife, and the rest: all well: in the pic
ture. A feature of Interest is the Mas
cagni Incidental music, quite .well dorle,
and crowded houses are assured for/the
week. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.? .
California.
There is plenty to amuse in. the mu
sical extra vaganzao "Every-Day 'Life,"
presented by the Ideal's Company at
the California last night. The piece,
which, like others of Its class, is de
void of plot, serve's to introduce a num
ber of very clever specialties and an
ensemble ( of chorus girls that are "far
above the average in good looks. 1: The
comedy work is entrusted- to Frank
O'Brien, who plays the rather thread
bare part of a tramp in a way to win
the laughter of his auditors. His danc
ing is not the least of. his accomplish
ments and earned for him 'several .re
calls. Katherine Klare is handsome as
the leading lady, who has nothing to' do
but wear beautiful gowns and sing two
or three songs, both of which she does
admirably. Carrie Franklin makes" a
pretty soubrette. although " somewhat
inclined to . avoirdupois. The, - chorus
girls arc seen and heard in a delightful
miniature minstrel show': and their cos-~
turnes, which are new and bright, lend
considerable color to the show. 'One of
the best features in a performance well
worth seeing is the Llvingstono-.Fam
ily^ who are billed as marvelous, \ and
certainly live up to. -the adjective.
They do some new stunts in the'acro
batic line â¢ which - would . soern- to have
reached its limit in sensational .turns.

presents the best side of her work.
James Xeill, in the part of Sir Phillip,
Is as pleasing as ever. Of course. Mrs.
Nelll plays Thelma and makes love to
her husband â fact and fancyâ in the
beautiful Norwegian way demanded by
the piece. Reginald Travers makes an
excellent Lorrimer, giving enough -hu
mor to the production to remove the
gloom that otherwise might oppress as
a result of a very accurate transfer
ence from book to play of the Corelll
morbidness. The others of the cast
furnish adequate support for the lead

success from the box-office standpoint.

N Central.
The production of the melodrama
"The Lighthouse by the Sea at the
Central Theater last night was greeted
by a large and enthusiastic audience.
The story of the play is interesting and
appeals to the sympathies of the au
dience. As usual, virtue triumphs over
villainy and all ends .happily. Herschel
Mayall as Paul Clifford, : a young, coast"
pilot, was excellent .and, the ways in
which he foiled the. villains literally
brought down the house. Miss Edna
Ellsmere, as Flora, the heroine, played
the part to perfection. George P. Web
ster was a villain of the darkest hue
and was aided effectively by Charles
Edler, who was In love with the hero
ine. George Nicholls gave a spirited
portrayal of the blind lighthouse keeper
and James Corrigan was funny in the
comedy role of a foundling. % Myrtle
Selwyn was clever as the maid of all
work and the other' parts were well
sustained. The drama was' most effect
ively mounted.
The Chutes.
Stephen Fltzpatrick and his clever lit
tle company, presenting their pretty
playlette, "The Honored Visitor," head
ed a good bill at the Chutes yesterday.
Wallace's pickaninnies proved agile
dancers and good singers, -and the De
tric Brothers, direct from the Hippo
drome, New York, gave one of the most
extraordinary exhibitions of strength
ever seen in this city. James Hawley
told some splendid dialect stories and
Cliff Dean and. his company of come
dians repeated their hit |of last" week.
Leona Clifton, the pleasing singer of il
lustrated ballads, and the animatoscope,
showing many modern and amusing
'moving pictures, completed an unusu
ally 'strong - programme: '. Zarrow, " the
Intrepid cyclist, gives his startling act,
"leaping- the gap," every afternoon and
evening *and the amateurs promise sev
eral surprises on Thursday night. There
is a cake walk at the Chutes every Sat

what a - simple device" the elaborate safe

is;, In a measure, corroborated by the

\u25a0was \ highly esteemed.'
; Soon after .the theft Leonard mailed a
package containing. $300,000 In securities
to the; residence of Dyer Pearl, senior

HER BANDIT
CAREER SHORT
Special Dtesatch to Tba Call.
LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. 2 âDressed in
trousers and otherwise _ disguised as a
man, Mrs. James Gifford, a pretty young
woman of 22, was last night captured
at Hallam, Neb., while trying to rob a
store. â¢ According to the woman's story
her career as a bandit was a short one.
She came to Nebraska three weeks ago
and had in that time successfully held
up stores In three different towns, get
ting away with a total of about $110.
Her husband accompanied her to keep
watch and warn her if officers came in
sight.
At Hallam she watched her opportu
nity and entered the store when no one
was in sight but the clerk. Walking to
him in a business-like way as if Jto
make' a purchase, she pointed her gun
in his face and asked for the cash in the
till. Her coming, however, had been
anticipated, and as the clerk walked to
the* till an officer stepped out and dis
armed her.. . ; '/^
. It appears she had been followed from
the town of Cortland, where she ope
rated a few nights ago, and when she
arrived In Hal lam an officer was Imme
diately placed In the only store in the
town to await her. Her husband was
arrested \u25a0 with her' and both were*
brought to Lincoln. .
moved to the Central Emergency Hospital,
where his injuries were dressed by Dr.
Kucuch. . '

the small boat, which began immediately
to fill with water. \u25a0 Neither Shannon nor
Miss Bones wa3 able to swim. Driswell
made a heroic. effort to save Miss Bones,

were too much for him and he was obliged
to release his hold.

girl's aid, but was himself almost
drowned. The' bodies were recovered this

MR. LOOMIS AND THE PRESIDENT.
/pHE persistent attacks upon Mr. Loomis, Assistant Secretary of?
J State, by several newspapers, have really been made for the
* purpose of indirect censure of the President. As soon as Secre
tary Hay died these attacks appeared. and increased in virulence,
using the great name of Mr. Hay to impeach the course of the
President. It was said that Mr. Hay revolted at official contact
with Mr. Loomis, and that he chafed under the decision against
Bowen, who was the accuser of Loomis. The matter was a serious
thing, affecting the honor of the country.
The State Department must be above suspicion. It must have
the respect of foreign nations. It is the keeper of our international
character. Not only his country but the world trusted John Hay.
If it were true that he supported Bowen and distrusted Loomis, then
the President was under the serious charg^ of overruling his Secre
tary of State in a matter vitally affecting the morals of the State
Department, and calculated to lower it^and the Government in the
estimation of the world. Any one with a knowledge of affairs could
see that these attacks were inspired by Bowen himself. When it
became necessary to deal with his charges against Mr. Loomis he
went to trial before a friendly court. r>"*
The investigation was made by Secretary Taft. He and Bowen
were classmates and personal friends. Bowen,' in his semi-official
â¢ letters to Taft, addressed him as "My Dear Bill," and in other ways
manifested extreme personal familiarity. Secretary Taft on his side
treated Bowen in the way of a friend, assuring him that his position
in the diplomatic service was assured, if the investigation went well.
On the surface of things Loomis went to trial under circumstances
unfavorable to him. The President does not regard personal friend
ship in official matters that concern official integrity and- the honor
. of the country.
No matter how good his personal relations were with Mr. Loomis
that gentleman could, expect only the severest condemnation if war
ranted by his conduct. He entered the investigation with absolutely
no protection except the integrity of his conduct, while Bowen had
all the advantage on his side. Under such circumstances the case
was gone into patiently anci thoroughly. Bowen was given every;
opportunity and extension of time in which to collect his evidence
and present it. Moved by his venomous personal feeling against
Mr. Loomis, it is to be admitted that he made the best use of his
opportunity.
He was toiling to avenge himself upon a man whom he hated,
and to secure for himself honor and promotion in the diplomatic
service. That he exerted himself to the utmost is evident. He had
â¢ the assistance of President Castro of Venezuela, who is also virulent
against Mr. Loomis, and is full of the peculiar resources required in
fighting such a battle.
With all of these advantages Bowen and Castro failed utterly.
Their evidence was shown to be sophisticated and worthless. All
â¢ that Mr. Loomis had done was to use the American Asphalt Com
pany instead of a i)ank, in the transfer of money. This was per
fectly natural, as tnere was no American bank in Caracas, and the
asphalt company was continually handling money and exchange be
tween the two countries. Still, that was regarded as bad judgment
on his part, because the asphalt company was in collision with Cas
tro, and he was censured for it in the report.
But Bowen. was condemned, and properly dismissed from the
service* Then followed the death of Secretary Hay in the height
of his popularity and when he enjoyed, more than any other head
of a chancellory, the respect and affection of the world. With his
death came the opportunity of Bowen, and he used it in misrepre
senting Mr. Hay's attitude to the controversy and his feeling toward
Mr. Loomis. There were newspapers that willingly lent themselves
to his purpose, in the belief that no means existed by which the
President and Mr. Loomis could prove the position of Mr. Hay*>and
â¢vindicate themselves. But the means were at hand and have been
used. â¢ .
It is proved that Secretary Hay. profoundly distrusted Bowen,
regarded him as unsafe^and disloyal, an.d at the same time had the
utmost confidence in the integrity and ability of Mr. Loomis. He
was hurt by the qualified censure of Loomis, believing that it was
hardly warranted by the facts disclosed in the investigation. It
further appears that instead of being forced out of the State De
partment Mr. Loomis had informed the Secretary long before the
Bowen charges that he intended to resign^ and that Mr. Hay depre
cated this decision and desired him to remain while he continued as
Secretary of State. These facts are clinched by the word of the
President of the United States, and Mr.- Loomis stands vindicated
arid clean before his countrymen.
Aside from the large national considerations involved, California
is gratified by this vindication, because Mr. Loomis is a property
* owner in this State and is almost one of us. He has been prompt in
assisting California interests before the State Department, which
is quite necessary because of our distance from the capital, which
frequently makes us wait until those who are nearer get service. He
has represented his country usefully abroad in matters of difficulty
and delicacy, and all good men are glad that he stands proved blame
less and stainless. â. â¢;\u25a0; , >
GREAT BRITAIN'S COUP.
. /^*\ UR Uncle John Bull has been quiet to the verge of.humility and
f .1 submissiveness. He has been listening to tales^about his mil-
itary and naval defects and weakness, told in his own Parlia
ment. He has, watched the flirting of his imperial nephew of Ger
man}' with the Sultans. There have been those who see in their
mind's eye his great empire dissolving, his trade going to the dogs,
his army in retreat, his navy flying signals of distress.
Through it all he has kept still and sawed-wood. That is his
way. He looked dejected while the last Russo-Turkish war went on,
and then one morning turned up smiling with a majority of the
. Suez canal stock in his trousers pocket; the owner of a water high
way controlled at one extreme by Gibraltar and at the other by Aden!
The Russian Baltic fleet started out by firing on his fishermen, and
sailed on arid on past Singapore and through the .China Sea until it
met Togo in the Sea of Japan and sailed no more. iThen Uncle -John
Bull, as the boys say, got a move on. He does not like the entry of
war fleets into the China Sea over his roadway, and, using.his owner
ship of some land and his protectorate over more," decides upon plac
ing at Singapore an impregnable naval station for his use and.that
of his friend, the Mikado.
; Get down- the, map of those warm parts the world and it will
*be seen that no armed fleet, or unarmed for that matter, can pass on
the way to China without his consent. The Kaiser may" tip. winks to
Sultans on the Mediterranean and the Golden Horn, but he" is shut
out from his land grab on the Gulf of Pechili, and will have to walk
humbly before the lord of the hot waters of the Orient. It is a coup
of the first importance in its relation to the future of Eastern, Asia.
With Russia shut out of Manchuria and the railroad in possession of
Japan, the naval power that commands the Straits of Malacca .polices
the. China Sea against every nation except the United States. .
We reach that sea on our own water to Manila. Thus the United
States, Great Britain and Japan are the only nations that can- make
effective any policy concerning Eastern Asia, its destiny and its trade.'
That they will co-operate to secure justice, to respect the autonomy
of China and the progress of that empire" under its own government
there can be no" doubt. With the British navy at Singapore, the
Japanese at Nagasaki and ours at .Manila, there will be peace that
passeth all understanding in Eastern; Asia.
However, Mr. Rockefeller should remember that one Thomas M. Lawson
is. the only simon-pure panic predicter.â Detroit Free Preii^

OCCIDENTAL
ACCIDENTALS
A. J. Waterhouse
WHEN BLOSSOM AROSE.
BLOSSOM appreciates the charm of
rural existence, and so he lives pret
ty well out in the country over on
the other; side of the bay. As he has to
be in his office in the city at 8 o'clock, his
morning hours ]J are strenuous enough to
please our honored" President. They
would be more strenuous, however, were
it not for Mrs. Blossom, for, she rises at
6 o'clock, milks the cow, prepares the
breakfast, calls her husband at 8:10 and
otherwise takes much of the burden from
his frail shoulders.
The other day Mrs. Blossom was called
from home by the sickness of her mother,
and with many misgivings* she left her
husband to attend to his own destinies.
She said that she thought he ought to get
an alarm clock, but he said, "No; I wiil
sit up all night before I will . be roused
from sleep and scared to death by the un
expected explosion of one of those infer
nal machines of , horror!" Mrs. Blossom
remarked that she felt some apprehension
that he would not wake without such a
clock,, but Blossom said that 'women were
always feeling apprehension and that a
business man could not afford" to devote
time to attending to them. So the lady
gave him a long and complicated list of
final instructions (none- of which he re
membered) and departed, his last words
to her Deing an- assertion that : she . need
not worry about his not getting up in
time, as he had but to fix his intellect on
any given time and he would awake then
without fail. His intellect must have
slipped a cog in the instance under con
siderationâbut that is the story.
Blossom went to bed that night, with a
fixed determination to wake at precisely
eleven minutes before 5 o'clock. He slept
fitfully, his slumber being broken by
hideous dreams that his wife had bought
an immense alarm clock, which she was
determined to get into the house In order
to awaken him, but found it too large to
go through the door. When he finally
waked the room was very bright and he
feared that he had overslept, so be
jumped out of bed In a hurry in order to
ascertain the time. Ifl doing so he stepped
on the cat. and that miniature tiger im
mediately buried her claws deeply in hia
left calf. If Mrs. Blossom had been there
then to hear his remarks she probably
would have wept profusely.
Mrs. Blossom usually wound the clock;
he had forgotten to do so, and the trusty
timepiece had stopped at 12:03. His watph
was at the jewelers for repairs, but the
brightness of the room told Blossom an
awful tale about the time, so he dressed,
hurried up his scanty breakfast, although
he did not seem to be hungry, seized the
milk pail and went out to interview the
bossy. ' When he got outside he found
that the full moon was responsible for
the brightness, and Blossom's suspicions
grew antithetically dark. Just then
Smith, his next neighbor, came "reeling,
rolling home, boys." and after much ex
planation Blossom ascertained from him
that the time. was 2:25. â¢.....\u2666 < J,
Unless you have been similarly situated
you will not realize the situation in
which Blossom was then placed. The
question was. To go to bed, or not to go
to bed? It seemed a pity to Vaste two
and one-half hours of precious possibility
of sleep, but, on the contrary, he had lost
some confidence in the ; capacity of his
intellect to break the silken chains ox
slumber at a given . time. He finally de
cided to pass the rest of the time till
daylight by reading in his Morris chair,
keeping his clothing on.
When Blossom reached the office the
next morning at .ten minutes before 11
o'clock, after sleeping in the Morris chair
till 915, he' did not like the â¢ glance that
the "old man" cast at him. ' He devoted
an unpleasant five minutes to explaining,
but the "old man" only said: "Humph!
Yes? 1 hope you will not let.it occur
aBÂ»a BÂ» now 'has bought an alarm
clock and is growing pale underwits morn
ing ministrations. He says he trusts no
body will let Mrs. Blossom know about
his adventure, for if any one does he
never will hear the last of it, and I hope
that his trust will not be misplaced.
"Fogg told a story at the club the other
day. and then he laughed andjaughed.
but nobody else smiled."
"Must have chilled him considerably,
"Well I should say not! At any rate,
he catted me to one side shortly . after
ward and expressed the opinion that the
lack of the sense of humor displayed by
some people was both pitiful and ap
palling." -. *

A few brief hours In guessing spent.
And then the misty veil is rent.

SWEARS FROST
KNEW OF CODICIL
Day Says Eastern Attorney
Was Aware of Existence of
Addendum to Davis Will
Robert Day, a beneficiary under the
contested penciled codicil of the will
of tbe lato Samuel Davis, who was
present at the finding of the instru
ment and one of the most important
| witnesses for the proponents, was on
I the stand all day yesterday In Judge
j Kerrig-an's court. The most important
j testimony g-iven by Day was thaf At
torney Frost of New York had knowl
! edge of the existence of the contested
| codicil before it was found among the
! effects of the deceased and that Frost
I Instructed the searchers to look closely
I for such document.
i The admission of this evidence,
) which is of great importance to the
proponents, was fought against by the
attorneys for the contestants, but
without avail. When, he was finally
permitted to testify Day said:
"H. H. Frost Jr., attorney for Samuel
Davis French, one of the grandneph
ows of the deceased, who resides In
! New York, instructed me to search for
I a pencil codicil, ' saying that ' he had
I been informed that Davis had left such
an Instrument,"
This testimony was given by Day
!at the afternoon session. During the
! morning: session he recited the story
i of the search of Davis" effects shortly
i after his death and of the finding of the
! codicil that is now In Question. He
said:;
In June lesa than two months after Davis'
death. Attorney Frost and Samuel . DaylÂ«
French came West. In company with W. B.
R*is and the witness the Easterners went to
tbe office of Attorney E. S. PllUbury. There
i Frost stated that he had heard ot tne . pencil
codicil and asked that a search for the same be
made among the Â«ffects of inÂ« deceaÂ«ed. It
was suggest ed that Mr. Kris and I make the
I search. 1 being assured that I would be paid
i for my work. Young Rels consented, to as
sist If his father, who was named as executor
of thÂ« original will, would give his consent.
This was obtained and a starch was carried
on tor -several days but without success.
Our failure to find the missing instrument
Iwfti reported to Mr. Pillsbury. The attorney
[ then suggested that I continue the siarch, as
! sleted by Charles C. SuUlvan. who is con
nected with Mr. Plllsbury'a office. ThÂ« search
then recommenced, 1 acting chiefly aÂ« a wit
ness. Mr. Sullivan doing : most of thÂ« work. ;
AH of the papers left by the deceased were
crocured and finally the codicil was discovered.
I waÃ standing probably five or six feet
from Kullivan when hÂ« found the codicil. He j
haa a' bunch, of papers on his lenee. In the-j
midet of a bundle he found an envelope; one
that had contained a letter, inside of which
was the penciled codicil. There were several
otner people In the room at the time of the
discovery.
After identifying- the envelope in.
which the codicil wad; found, Day was
excused from, the stand and an ad
journment until this morning ordered.
He will be further questioned to-day. :

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. q-UESDAY; OCTOBER 3,, 1905/
Visit to the Cliff
' House to Vary
Proceedings.
There was: a hum and buzz about the
Palace yesterday that made the loungers
In the Palm Garden look up. ...
It was the - foregathering: day of the
Dixie Daughters, and the upon
credentials for the national convention
had a busy time of it. \u25a0 .
Early in the day the â¢ delegates were
about, exchanging greetings ' ana getting
their bearings about the neighborhood
of the hotel. .- .-Â» ; ,
In the afternoon the visitorsâ all of
whom are the guests of the Albert Sidney
Johnston Chapter â were* taken about' the
bay in the Slocum, visiting the islands
that jewel the bay and Sansalito and
Vallejo. A perfect day on the water,
tbe guests were- enthusiastic over the
beauty of the bay, enfolded by the roll
ing hills of Alameda and Marin.
Last night many private affairs were
arranged for the visiting womenâ and for
the visiting men, too, of whom there are
manyâ but no public function.
The real work of the convention will
begin this morning in the White and Gold
room, when the president of the na-
tional body, Mrs. A. T. . Bmythe of
Charleston. S. C, will be escorted to the
chair by the hostess chapter. Prayer will
then be offered byahe Right Rev. Bishop
Nichols, tq be followed by the presenta
tion of the keys of the city by Mayor
Schmitz.
To Governor Pardee : falls the honor of
the address of welcome to the State, and
Mrs. Victor Montgomery of Santa Ana,
the State president, will voice the wel
come to San Francisco. .
The speechmaking, which is- always
more or lees prosy_ will be foregone in
the afternoon for a trip to the Cliff
House. But the evening will see the con
vention in session again, as there is much
business to get through, and women are
not particularly expeditious when there's
a nice chance for an argument.
To-day will occur the pretty ceremony
of presenting to the national body a por
trait of the well-beloved flounder, Mrs.
Merriweather Goodlet, she who is ac
knowledged queen of the convention.
To-morrow the usual morning and even
ing business sessions will be held, with a
trip to Mount Tamalpals on the 1:45 boat
âthis one of the strongest features of the
entertainment provided by the hostess
chapter.
Thursday afternoon comes the smart
reception at the St. Francis, at which the
Jefferson Davis Chapter will be hostess.
Friday the annual tree-planting will en
gage the delegates, and at night comes
the big. charity ball, the culminating so
cial feature of the convention week.
And, apropos of the ball, every delegate
may secure her card of admittance onap
plication to Mrs. Eugene B. Grace, treas
urer, who .will be on hand at the head
quarters at the Palace every ' morning
during -the week. \u25a0..\u25a0 As a worker this
plucky little Southerner is a trumpâ so,
too, is the president of the hostess j chap
ter. Mrs. Alfred Hunter Voorhies, who is
entertaining . a large, bouse party of dele
gates and friends.
": One of the most distinguished women
in the local chapters is. Mrs. : William B.
Prichard, daughter of General Albert Sid
ney Johnston, who holds the honor of be
ing one of the live honorary vice presi
dents of the organization. .

SALE OF DRUGS

of Remedies That Contain
Any Deleterfous ; -Prbperties 1
COMMISSIONER IS HERE
Octavius ?eaie Will Study
the Laws of Tkis Country
Bearing on the Subject
Among yesterday's arrivals; on the
eteamshlp ' Sonoma from the Australian
colonies was Octavlus C. Beale of Syd
ney, one of the leading manufacturers
of -New South Wales and president, of
the Chamber of Manufacturers of that
country. The visitor, who Is accom
panied by his wife and is en: route to
England, has been commissioned by
his Government to look into the vari
ous laws *of this country bearing upon
the sale of so-called patent medicines
containing deleterious properties, with
a view to suggesting means â¢ for .dis
couraging the traftic\ in the:cplonie3,
where a strong feeling is being
aroused against the use of "mixtures
that are known to be destructive to
mankind. Upon this^ubject Mr. Beale
said last evening at the Palace Hotel:
The sale of so-called remedies, filled with
deleterious properties, has . grown \u25a0to an alarm
lns state In , 'the colonies. .\u25a0 All one has to do
is to patent hls-confcoction and-: send it . Into
the open market^for sale. .There Is need, ol
a law to . regulate ' the sales of f patent med
icines and the " Chamber of Manufacturers , ii
apitatins: a- movement in that direction and
has the support of the people and the Gov
ernment/The same terrible condition of affa:ra
exists in -England, and while I am not -here
to, criticize- Americans I understand that you
have been having experience of a'eimilai
nature. \u2666.--We are not making any fight against
AmeHcan medicines, but simply preparing .to
protect our people aeainst medicines of this
character from all parts of ' the \u25a0' world. In
Germany it is a crime to sell . medicines In
which poisons are used in the manner they
are in our country and England. We intenu
to adopt some kind of a law that will com
pel the â¢ manufacturer of patent medicines to
register his formuFa and to live up to it.'
without. poisoning the people.- \u25a0
Mr. Beale says the people of â¢ the
Australian colonies are watching with
deep interest the present agitation in
this country against unrestricted im
migration of the Oriental races to the
United States. The >colonists. he said,
feel that their interests" in the matter
of Oriental immigration are practically
the- samo as those of vthe Americans,
but he doubts, whether jany change in
the sentiment here, particularly if it
should be in favor ol the Chinese and
Japanese, would, in any way alter the
feeling- -among his countrymen. He
said:
. The people of the colonies long ago took
precautions that have greatly restricted tha
Chinese and Japanese immigration to their
countries and there is little rear that the
existing laws will be changed. A tax of $500
la imposed on every Chinese who enters the
colonies and" naturally comparatively few have
come to our shores. , Strangely though, al
though our records show that
the immigration has not increased, we have
discovered through the 'means of the * census
that It has and the fact has suggested* the
possibility of many Chinese having secretly
crossed the colonial borders. . In the case of
Japanese a strong restriction haa confronted
them in what is commonly called the language
test, applied In; all the. .colonies, which re
.qulres that eveTy'immlgrant must speak onÂ»
of : several Kuropean languages before he can
be permitted , to land. . Although It has been
claimed by many of the mine owners of'Aus
tralia-'that-cheap-Oriental labor iÂ» necessary
in the operation of, the mines, the coolie ha*
not yet been permitted to enter the "mines
and I doubt If he will In .the future, -i . .

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.. Oct. 2.â Theodore
Roosevelt Jr. and more than 100 other
awkward freshmen to-day came out as
candidates for the Harvard 1909 eleven.
Roosevelt was clad in a well-padded new
yellow suit with crimson Jersey and
stockings. In contract to the big fellows
on the squad he looked slender and unfit
for a rough game. Inasmuch, however,
as fully two-thirds of the squad were no
larger than he, the President's son was
by no means conspicuous for his stature.
Roosevelt was put through the differ
ent stunts of falling on the ball, running,
catching and passing Just like every other
member of the squad. His training at
Groton, where he played end for four
years, stood him in good stead and he
made a less awkward appearance than
many of tbe other freehies.
He seemed to have lots of spirit, too,
and when it came his turn to tumble on
the ground in front of the rest of the
fellows he did so with all his might. As
usual quite a number of persons were
on hand, many of whom undoubtedly
being drawn by curiosity to see a real
President's son. Harvard as yet is not
altogether used to the idea of having
such a celebrity in her ranks.

mings at that time was the thought of

becomes a permanent trouble.

as a result, and tho doctor told zno I

TRANSIT TOLL
DECLARED LAW
Circuit Court of Appeals
Decides in Favor of the
Collection of the Same
GILBERT DISAGREES
Says That Possession of a
Through Ticket to Europe
Sufficient Evidence
The alien-in-transit head tax case was
decided yesterday by the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals against the
Oceanic Steamship Company and in favor
of the action of 'United States Customs
Collector Frederick S. Stratton in having
collected $2 per head for 210 alien passen
gers in transit through the United States.
"The opinion of the court' was written by
Judge Hawley, and a vigorous dissenting
opinion was filed by Presiding Judge Gil
bert. On the trinl in the United States
Circuit Court Judge Morrow- decided that
the Imposition 'of $2 head tax, even tem
porarily, upon alien passengers in transit
was a violation of thtj statute, which ex
pressly forbids the imposition of such a
tax. The Government appealed.
Judge Hawley. held that rule 15 of the
regulations of the Commissioner of Imml-;
gratlon was valid: that it was necessary*
to protect" the, Government from imposi
tion by aliens who. might, at an Asiatic
or Australian port, purchase a through
ticket to Europe, then on their arrival at
San Francisco or. other . point id the
United States might sell the ticket and
remain here, thus defrauding the Govern
ment out of $2. Judge Hawley called at
tention to the fact also that the record
did not show that any of the 210 passen
gers had ever left the United States. }
Judge Gilbert in his dissenting opinion
said :
The statute which imposes a tax on passen
gers not citizens of the United States arriving
on vetseis coming from a foreign country to
a port within the United Slates contains the
express provision that the nead' tax. herein ;
provided for shall not bÂ» levied uuon aliens
in transit thiough the United- States. The act
furtlur provides that the Commissioner " Gen
eral of Immigration shall establish such rules
rtot Inconsistent with the law as he shall deem
best calculated for carrying out the provisions
of the act. and ' for protecting the United
States and aliens migrating thereto .from
fraud and loss. This provision for the protec
tion oÂ£ aliens evidently- refers to aliens in
transit through the United States for other
liliens can ned no protection. The Commls
siorer General has seen fit to protect the
United States and the aliens migrating thereto
from fraud. and loss by requiring the payment
of the head tax by every alien who arrives at
a port in thf United States in transit there
ihrough. and by leaving him the doubttul rem
edy of obtaining repayment thereof upon proof
satisfactory to the immigration officer in
charge at the port oÂ£ arrival that he has passed
through and out of . the United States by a
direct and continuous journ;y. In other} words,
the plain Intendment of the statute is violated
in the first instance by levying the tax upon
aliens who. the law gays, shall be exempt from
the tax; but it is said that the law is not vio
lated tor thÂ« reason that provision is made for
refunding the tax so levied. Just what kind
of proof shall be required of such aliens in
order to recover the money paid is not specified
in the rules and regulations. â¢ * * If the
possession of through tickets to European ports
by way of the United States Is not sufficient to
convince the Collector of the port of San Fran
i-lsco that the holders thereof ' are In transit
through the United States, it is not.perceiv
able how any \u25a0schenid can be de\-ised- by" which
lhÂ»y can thereafter. r pn)Ve 'to Ms satisfaction
that they did/in fact carry out their pro
fessed purpose, without incurring a burden of
cxr<Â»nÂ«e and trouble so great as to effectually
deter them Jfrom undertaking < it." â¢; â¢ â¢
There Is the plain statutory provision that no
head tax shall be imposed upon alien pas
sengers in tnnslt. The effect of the regulation
of the Commissioner of Immigration is clearly
to lnnx.se such a head tax.- and for that rea
son I think the Judgment of the Circuit Court
fhould-be affirmed. '. '. ( :â¢'\u25a0â¢ ., . ..

A BRANCH LINE
Southern Pacific Company
-> Desires Additional Privi
leges for Bay Shore Road
BUYS LAND FOR PARK
Board of Supervisors Takes
Steps for the Preserva
tion of Telegraph Hill
The Southern Pacific Company filed a
petition with the Board of Supervisors
yesterday for a franchise to operate a
branch line of railroad, together, with
certain spur tracks, in connection with
its Bay Shore line. The proposed line
starts at a point on the already con
structed railroad, on Seventh street, be
tween Pennsylvania avenue and Missis
sippi street, and runs thence along Sev
enth, Sixteenth, Texas, Eighth. Fif
teenth. Carolina and Rhode Island
streets. The petition also prays for
spur track privileges on Arkansas, Six
teenth. Rhode Island and Fifteenth
streets, to connect with Potrero block
136./; The petition was referred to the
Street Committee.
The Southern Pacific Company also
submitted an ordinance authorizing the
lease lof certain real property owned by
the city, known as Produce Exchange
and Market Place. The ordinance di
rects that bids be advertised for the'
lease of the blocks at â¢ a price not less
than $600 per month for the first flve
years, and thereafter an amount equal
to 3 per cent per annum on the value of
the properties, to be determined by arbi
tration, but not to be less than $750 per
month. The Southern Pacific Company
desires to lease the property under the
terms of its Bay Shore franchise. The
ordinance will be considered by the Fi
nance Committee.
SPUH TRACK PERMIT.
The ordinance granting the Santa Fe
Company a permit to operate a spur
track on Kansas and De Haro streets
was passed to print. Attorney Jere
Burke objected to the passing of the per
mit because it would shut the Southern
Pacific Company out of the dis
trict lying west of Kansas street, and
from Eighth and Townsend south to Sev
enteenth and Mariposa streets. His pro
posed amendment that the right is re
served by the board to grant to any or
all other railroads jointly the same privi
leges granted to the Santa Fe Company
was adopted.
W. Jones ' Cuthbertson petitioned j that
the publication of the map presented by
the Association for the Adornment of
Ean Francisco, upon which is delineated a
certain " boulevard from Market and Do
lores street to the present park panhan
dle, be laid over until a settlement has
been made of tils claim as "author" of
the part copyrighted. It was referred to
a committee.
The board accepted the offer of G. P.
and C. A. Wetmore to sell for $5075 a lot
of land at the corner of Montgomery and
Lombard streets, required for a park to
preserves Telegraph Hill. .
The offer of Ellen Goff to sell for $30,000
a lot of land forming part of the new
public library; site'," on Fell street;! was
rejected ; and the- City ,' Attorney directed
to begin' condemnation s proceedings'^ for
the same, the price being considered ex
cessive.
â¢ ,T^p -board authorized the repairing of
HaVrison street," from Fourth to Sixth,
for $31,500.
EXTRA CLERK NEEDED.
The Mayor .was .requested to recom
mend â the appointment of an additional
clerk in the County Clerk's office . to ex
pert the books and to collect collateral
inheritance taxes. Tne Finance Commit
tee reported that the clerk is needed.
The following ordinances were finally
passed:

Company to lands reaulred for the widening
of fourth. Kentucky and Sixteenth streets in
accordance with the conditions of the Bay
Shore franchise.
Imposing a graduated license of $25, $15

Washington Crop Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
W&sMnsion Crop Bulletin, week ended Sep
tember 26, Is as follows:
The mean temperature of the week was
about 5 degrees above normal In the- western
division of the State, and still warmer in the
eastern dlrtsion. The warm spell culminated
on the 21st and 22d with maximum tem
peratures in the tout heart counties of 60 to VO
degree*. There was nothing to be Injured
by the warm weather aod It was favorable
for farm work, excest itat it was very warm
â¢ lor threshing. There was no rain to Interrupt
ifcresfcleg in the eastern counties, except la
.& few localities, and it is nearly completed,
except la the latest districts, such as Douglas
County, where It will be continued for several
\u25a0weeks. The results of threshing show the
wir.ter wheat yield to have been excellent,
and the aprinc wheat crop Is very good, ex
â¢cept In a portion of Whitman County, wher*
it was damaged by heat and winds to the
extent of one-fifth. Walla Walla, Adams.
Spckane, Lincoln and Douglas counties report
excellent yields of wheat. Barley was a verj
pood crop, and oats a fair crop. Potatoes arÂ«
)ess than an average. Fruit, except in thÂ» i
irrigated valleys, vai either injured by late ;
froete or blown oft by high winds. Some â¢
plowing and fall wheat sowing have been
dor.c but the soil is yet very dry.
Rains fell on three or four dates in the
western counties ana were heavy In some parts.
oa.* threshing was delayed In the northwest
~Jk~iztlem but If the ebocks and stacks dry
eoori. there will not be much Injury. TnÂ»
>V 4 la quit* heavy and of excellent quality.
iiop picking was interrupted by wet weather.
The crop Is -very uneven; is some places
heavy In others light; in some yards of good
quality, and In others green, rusty aod la
jured by vennla.
The rains greatly improved pastures sad
helped vegetables some. Late potatoes ha<l
Insufficient moisture in July and August,
fhorterrlrg the crop considerably. The fruit
crop is on the whole plentiful in the western
counties.

aM of the nÂ«wÂ« s calculated to uphold con

Future Grain nnd Provisions.
CHICAGO, Oct. 2. â Notwithstanding a num
ber of bearish influences the wheat market i
was strong throughout the entire session. At
the start the market was affected to sonla
extent by :th.e steadiness manifested In the
wheat market at Liverpool, v Owing to th*
sharp decline in Chicago Saturday a majoritj
of traders here expected a considerable re
action- in prices at foreign grain markets.
Cables, ' however, failed jto confirm â¢ this ex
pectation values at Liverpool being a trifle
lower. For December opening quotations hert
were unchanged to *>,c higher at -&t%@S39sc.
From the.start a leading bull, was an active
bidder for wheat, To this 1 fact seemed due
almost entirely, the strength manifested
throughout the entire day. Spurred on by the
demand of tfce bull leader pit traders be
came active purchasers. As prices advanced
Bhorts started to cover, causing still greatei
show of strength notwithstanding that news
of. the day otherwise was favorable . to the
bears. Weather.' in the Northwest was gen
erally clear. Receipts at Mlnneapols and Du
luth were again ot liberal volume. World*
shipments were large and the visible, supply
showed an Increase of 1.G45.000 bushels. Never
theless the market continued to gain In firm
ness. During the -. last' few moments, of trad
ing December touched the highest point of.
the -'day., sales being made at 84%@-84%c.
The close was -strong, with December l%t
higher at S4%c. " . ' \u25a0

ish and prices showed a moderate decline.

were notable features. Table Grape 3 were in
good supply, but steady, and some extra fancy
offerings of Tokay In crates from Santa â¢ Cruz
conircanded a- small- -premium. Seedless and

on the market. All other kinds were In bur

SAYS TOURISTS
ARE INSULTED
attorney Thomas Complains
of Way Inspectors Treat
Passengers on Steamers
ZIONIST WROUGHT UP
W. F. Smith Alleges United
States Officials Accorded
Him but Scant Courtesy
\V. Ford Thomas. Custom-house attor
ney for the Oceanic Steamship Company,
is very much wrought up over the dis
courteous treatment that is alleged to
have been accorded passengers on the big
liners of the company who arrive in this
port. Mr. Thomas a few days ago. wrote
Csmmiscioner . of Immigration Hart
Northr. asking that the matter be taken
up. Mr. Thomas cited the case of W. F.
Smith, one of the party of Zionists, who
was detained on the Sierra fro:n Septem
ber 11 to 20.
According to Smith's statement, he was
harshly used by David Griffiths, one of
the United States inspectors who boarded
the *hip. Smith alleges that Griffiths
insulted and abused him in every way
possible. He says Griffiths demanded to
be shown all the money of the party and
then turned to Smith and asked him if
he were married.
Smith replied he was and says that [
Griffiths pointed to his vrife and asked
Smith if that was his spouse. Smith says
he nodded assent and that Griffiths in
solently asked him if he were married to
Th? woman: Smith adds that he was
humiliated and insulted before the other \
passengers and was forced to wait around \
till Griffiths got ready to pay his atten
tions to him.
Thomas says this sort of thing has been
jrolng on for a long time and passengers
have been rudely treated and in fact in
sulted by the inspectors time ar*j again.
Thomas alleges it is hurting the busi
ness of the company, for tourigts who
have had bitter experiences on the ships
have been wont to compJain of their ill
treatment all aver the world.
Commissioner North refused to say
what official action would bÂ« taken In the
matter, but it is likely he will refer it
to the general department at Washing
ton. No formal charges have been filed
ag-ainst Inspector Griffiths.
Griffiths has made an affidavit, to
North setting forth his side of the case.
He says he did not treat Smith or any
other passenger with any disrespect.
He claims he held up Smith, thinking 1
thu. la*rter w.is a contract laborer from
statements he made. \u25a0 He says Smith
presented a very slovenly appearance
and looked as If he might have been
brought to this country under contract
to work for some firm.
To back up liis assertions, Griffiths has
presented affidavits signed by Hubert
O'Kcliy an<l George Maxwell, a customs
inspector of Vancouver, both of whom
wore passengers on the Sierra. They say
Smith was treated with due respect and
consideration. Griffiths says Smith was
slow -and\rather stupid in his replies to
question?. Tor which reason-others were
examined first. He al?o 'says that as
50 to 100 passengers have to be examined
In Jialf an hour there Is not time for
ceremonial politeness in the asking of
question*. fl

Prtsooff C>4<^nW With Murder, But
Ihr i:%lcÂ« ,_Â«â¢ Vk'im Held to
tie inftafÃctent: -â¢'
After a jury had been impaneled in [
Judpe Cook's court yesterday in the case
of Frank Donohue. charged with murder,
the Judge instructed the jury to return
a verdict of acquittal owing to the in
sufficiency of the evidence. '
Donohue lived on Mission street, be- !
twÂ«N?n Fifth and Sixth. On the evening of \u25a0â¢
November 20 he Â«nd his wife were sitting
on the front steps, and he arose and
crossed the street. When he returned to
his wife in a few minutes she told him
that Thomas Waickford, a respectable,
middle-aged man. who lived in the neigh
borhood, had Insulted her. -
Donohue went after Wackford and
struck him a blow on the face, knocking
him down, the back or his head striking
against the cobblestones. Wackford made
his way home, and the following morning
he was found unconscious In bed. He was
pent to the Central Emergency Hospital,
where he died. The autopsy showed that
a clot of blood had formed on his brain,
which was the cause of death, superin
duced by the effects of the blow from

Had Japan continued the war, he saiÂ£, |
it would have exhausted her financial re

To that * end the - city . has been 1 divided Into
four districts.- In district ' No. 1, which com
prises the principal- heavily traveled business
portion of the city, the 1 speed is limited to ten
miles an hour.' while this Is an increase from
the cxistlne "eight-mile rule,' "the fact that
cars stop at every - crossing minimizes , tha
danger of accidents. la 'district Ho. 2,, com
piling; the more densely settled' residence sec
tion, the speed .is limited to. twelve miles an
hour and In \u25a0 section No. 3 district . a' speed
of fifteen . mile's '- Is permitted. In the outlymg
section no. limit ?is .fixed, but:. tlio, company
will not run -cars 'at . a speed - treater ; than
safety - requires for : Its ' own protection from
damage suits. '; .; .' -'-, '". : \u25a0'-'-, '
The 'ordinance also provides that all
cars weighing more than eighteerMons
shall be provided , with -both air and

VOTE TO GRANT

Supervisors" Unanimously
Pass Ordinance in Favor
\ of Ocean Shore Company
CONDITIONS DIPOSED
Park Branch Line Will Be
Abandoned to the City; at
End of Twenty-Five Years
The Board of Supervisors yesterday by
a" unanimous vote finally passed the or
dinance granting the Ocean Shore â¢ Rail
way Company a franchise for' a term of
fifty years to operate an electric road
from a point on the county, line along cer
tain' streets ito the intersection of Army
and; Illinois streets, and also a twenty
five-year franchise for a>brancti line
crossing the park; intcf tne Richmond dis
trict and .terminating at Eleventh avenue
and, Fulton "street. The francnise was
granted on the express condition that the
park branch shall become the property
of (the city at the . end of twenty-five
years. \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0~ v ' \u25a0 \u25a0 '':'\u25a0-\u25a0:'
D'Ancona submitted an amendment pro
viding that "the franchise over the park
and Richmond route be granted upon the
condition ;that at the- termination, of .twen
ty-five years, the period of the franchise,
all the ; right, title, and interest of the
Ocean Shore : Railway Company, its suc
cessors or. assigns, in and to. the- road,
track and bed thereof and all its station
ary fixtures upon the public, streets, shall
become the property of the city and
county." \ v : 1 / '
WILL SURRENDER ROAD.
The attorney of the company agreed to
file a stipulation to surrender that portion
of the- road to , the city ; at the { end of
twenty.-flve years. D'Ancona said the con
dition is, advisable in: view of the doubt
as to the legality of granting a franchise
for -what Is regarded as a street railway
since j the charter requires bids ; to be in
vited for the* sale of such a franchise.
Camte " objected to imposing the' condi
tion as being superfluous. D'Ancona then
withdrew,, the amendment, after Branden
stein's motion that the condition to be im
posed upon the company, be incorporated
in a separate agreement with the city,
aside from the regular franchise, to be
filed before the Mayor signs the ordin
ance. ~'\u25a0. '' . \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0- .' - . " . -'- .-:-

tically the same route as that of the
! Ocean Shore Company and urged that the
! entire matter be referred to the City At
torney/for an opinion as to whether the
: franchise is still in effect. Asked as to
why the road /had not been buHt in thir
teen years, Sullivan said that $65,000 had
been expended in work outside of â¢: the

the franchise has not lapsed lies with
the WesVShore Company. ,

Boxton'said that Jtvhlle he would vote
to grant the franchise, because the public
demanded it, he believed that it was be

Jn vain did the gentleman from

Could ;he not manifest esteem for that

The bailiff, being of choleric temper,
warmly replied that only, ladies were
permitted to keep their heads covered
in that tribunal. Therefore, if Amman
Dammas did not retire .to the corridor

was probably a prayer for. forgiveness
of the unbeliever who thus abased- him.

noises emanated â¢ from the cafe, and
that they were made by the defend

requested to desist they united in a de
risive howl and uttered guttural gib

to be threats. Such goings-on were of
almost nightly Occurrence in the cafe.

have jarred the auricular nerves of

REMARKABLE CURES
BY CUTICURA REMEDIES
"I suffered with eczema oa my hands
for two years, but was at last cureil '
\u25a0v^ith the Cuticura Remedies* The dis-
ease commenced by finall, watery
pimples breaking out on the back of
-my. hands, which itched, burned, and
pained awful, as if an electric battery
was being held against my body. My
hands would swell until I could hardl^A-
use them. Then " they . would get <Â£r^
and scaly, then break out again and be
. the same tiling over. I was treated by
our family physician, but did not get
any better. Then I tried every kind
of oinjment I ever heard of, and every
home remedy any one recommended.
* "I then went to another doctor, who
helped them some, but after being
treated by him for three months my
hands were not well and the treatment
was so severe it was almost worse than
the disease.' I had often seen Cuticura
advertised and concluded to try it. It
just took two applications of Cuticura
Ointment to take the soreness out of
my hands. I commenced by putting
it on three times a day, then just in /
the evening, and when I had used four
boxes of Cuticura Ointment, one cake
Cuticura Soap, ariU three yjals of Cuti-
cura . Resolvent Pills, my hands were
well, and much softer and smoother
than ever before. Thanks to the Cuti-
cura ; Remedies. Yours respectfully,
Mrs. G. L.'Heston, Lucas, lowa, May
29,1905."
