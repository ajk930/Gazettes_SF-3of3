He hroke off. stared hard at me, and in
a trice stood smiling in his own despite,
"Or a better knave than I thought you,
Bunny, and by Jove it's the knave! Wellâ
I suppose I'm fairly drawn; I give you
best, as they say out thtre. As a matter
of fact I've bvtn thinking of the thing
myself: last night's racket reminds me of
It In one or two respects. I teil you what,
though, tnis is an occasion in any case,
and I'm going to celebrate it by breaking
the one good rule of my life. I'm going
to have a second drink!"
The whisky tinkled, the siphon
fizzed, tne ice plopped home; and seat
ed there in his pajamas, with the inev
itable cigarette, Raffles told me the,
Btory that I had given up hoping to
hear. The windows were wide open;
the sounds of Piccadilly floated in at
first. Long before he finished the last
wheels had rattled, the last brawler
was remeved, we alone broke the- quiet
of the tu".imeT night.
"â¢ â¢ â¢ No, they do you very well
indeed. You pay for nothing but
drinks, so to epeuk, but I'm afraid mine
were of a comprehensive character. I
had started In Â£. hole, I ought to have
refused the invitation: then we all
went to the Melbourne Cup. and I had
the ccrtnin winner that didn't win. and
that's not the only way you can play
the fcol in Melbourne. I wasn't the
steady old stager I am now, Bunny; my
analysis was a confession in It6elf. But
the others didn't know bow hard up I
was, and I swore they shouldn't. I
tried the Jews, but they're extra fly
out there. Then I thought of a.kins
man of sorts, a second cousin of my
fathe&s whom none of us knew any
thing about, except that he was sup
posed to be in one or other of the col
onies. If he was a rich man, well and
good, I would work him; if not. there
would be no harm done. I tried to get
on his tracks, and as luck would have
it. I t-uccceded (or thought I had) at
the very moment when I happened to
have a few days to myself. I was cut
over the hand Just â¢ before the big
Christmas match and couldn't have
bowled a ball if they had played me.
"The surgeon who fixed me up hap
pened to ask me if I was any relation
of Raffles of the National Bank, and
the pure luck of it almost took my
breath away. A relation who was a
high official in one of the banks, who
would finance me on my mere name â
could anything be better? I made up
my mind that this Raffles was the man
I- wanted and was awfully sold to find
next moment that he waen't a high of
ficial at all. Nor had the doctor so
much as met him, but had merely read
of him in connection with a small sen
sation at the suburban -branch which
my namesake* managed; an; armed rob
ber had been , rather pluckily beaten
off, uith a bullet in him, by this Raf
fles; and thfe sort of thing was sp com
mon out there -that this was the first
I had heardÂ»of it! 'A' suburban branch
âmy financier had faded. into some ex
cellent fellow with a billet to: lose If
he called his soul his own. Still a man
ager was a manager, and I said I would
soon see whether this was, the relative
I was looking for. if he would-be good
enough to give, me the name of that
branch. \
"Til do more/ cays the doctor. Til
TIJAT night he told me the story of
his earliest crime. Not since the
fateful morning of the Ides of
March, wheu he had Just men
tioned it as an unreported inci
dent cf a certain cricket tour, had I
succeeded in getting v word out of Raf
fles on the subject. It was not for want
of tryir.g; he would chake his head and
watch his riparctte smoke thoughtfully,
a subtle look in his eyes, half cynical,
half wistfui. as though the decent, hon
tct days that were no more had had their
merits alter all. Raffles would plan a
fresh enormity or jrlory in the last with
the unmitigated enthusiasm of the artist.
It was impossible to imagine one throb or
twitter of compunction beneath those
frankly egoistic and infectious transports.
And yet the ghost of a dead remorse
seemed still to visit him with the memory
of his tti-st felony, so that I had given
the story up long before the night of our
return from Milchester. Cricket, how
ever, was in the air, and Raffles' cricket
bag back where he Eometlmes kept it, in
the fender, with the remains of an Orient
label still adhering to the leather. My
eyes had been on this label for some time,
and I suppose his eyes had been on mine,
for all at once he asked me if I still
burned to hear that yarn.
"It's no use," I replied. "You won't spin
it. I rauFt imagine it for myself."
"How can you?"
"Oh, I begin to know your methods."
"You take it I went in with my eyes
open, as I do now, eh?"
"I can't imagine your doing otherwise."
"My dear Bunny, it was the most un
premeditated thing I ever did in my life."
His chair wheeled back into the books
as hfc sprang up with sudden energy-.
There was quite an indignant glitter in
his eyes.
"I can't believe that," said I craftly. "I
can't pay you such a poor compliment."
"Then you must be a fool"

and making for a peak that we could see
through the trees and following a creek
that I should see from , the; peak. Don't

a child in those days, r Of course,'^ the
shortcut .was the ; long way 'round,- and
it was nearly dark wnen ' that unluciy

"Well, Bunny, I may be a blackguard
myself, but I don't think 1 ever looked at
a fellow as that chap looked at me. But
1 stared him '\u25a0 out, "and "forced him to ad-,
mit that it was, blood- on. the twisted
saddle, and after that he became quite
tame. He told me exactly whÂ£t had hap
peued. A mate of \ his had been dragged
under a branch and had his nose smashed,
but that was all; had sat tight after it
till he dropped from loss o. blood;'an
other mate was with him back in the
bush.
get you the name of the branch he's
been promoted to, for I think I heard
they'd moved him up one already.' And
the next day he brought me the name
of the township of Yea, some fifty miles
north of Melbourne; but, with the
vagueness which characterized all his
information, he was! unable to say
whether !â¢ should find my relative there
â¢ pr not.
" 'He's a single man, and his initials
are, jW. F.,' said the doctor, who was
certain enough -of the Immaterial
points. 'He left his old post several
days ago, but It appears he's not due
at the new one till the New Year. No
doubt he'll go before then to take things
over and settle in. 'You might find him
up there and you might not If I were
you I should write.'
"â¢That'll lose two days,' said I, 'and
more If he isn*t there,' for I'd grown
quite keen on this up-country manager,
and I felt that If I could get at him
while the holidays were still on a lit
tle conviviality might help matters con
siderably. /
"'Then,' said the doctor, 'I should get
a quiet horse and ride. You needn't use
that hand.'
"Can't I go by train?'
" 'You can and you can't. You would
still have to ride. I suppose you're a
horseman?*
" Yes.' .
" 'Then I should certainly ride all
the way. It's a delightful road, through
Whittlesea and over the/Plenty Ranges.
It'll give you some idea of the bush,
Mr. Raffles, and you'll see" the sources
of the water supply of this city, sir.
You'll see where every drop of it cornea
from, the pure Van Yean. I wish I had
time to ride .with you.'
" 'But where can I get horse?*
"The doctor thought for a moment.
" 'I've a mare of my own that's as fat
as butter for want of work,' said Kp.
'It would be a charity to me to sit on
her back for a hundred miles or bo,
and then I should know you'd have no
temptation to use that hand.'
" 'You're far too good,' I protested.
"'You're A. J. Kaffles,' he saldl.
"And if ever there was a â¢ prettier
compliment or a finer Instance of even
Colonial hospitality I can only say,
Bunny, that I never heard of either."
He sipped his whisky, threw away
the stump of his cigarette and lit an
other before continuing.
"Well, I managed to write a line to
W. F. with my own hand, which, as you
will gather, was not very badly, wound
ed â it was simply this third finger that
was split and in splintsâ and. the next
morning the doctor packed me off on a
bovine beast that would have done for
an ambulance. Half the team came up
to see me start; the rest were rather
sick with me for not stopping to see the
match out, as if I could help them to
win by watching them. They little
knew the game I'd got on myself, but
still less did I know the game I was
going to play.
"It was an interesting ride enough,
especially after passing the place called
Whittlesea, a real wild township on the
lower slope of the ranges, where I rec
ollect having a deadly meal of hot mut
ton and tea. with the thermometer at
three figures in the shade. The first
thirty miles' or so was a good metal
road, too good to go half around the
world to ride on. but after Whittlesea It
was a mere track over the ranges, a
track I often couldn't see and left en
tirely to the mare. Now it dipped into
a gully and ran through a creek, and
all the time the local' color was inches
thick â gum trees galore and, parrots all
colors of the rainbow. In one place a
whole forest of gums had*been ring
barked and were Just as though they
had been painted white, without a leaf
or a living, thing for miles. And the ,
first living thing I did meet was tlv
sort to give you the creeps; it was a
riderless hor*e coming full tilt through
the bush, with the saddle twisted
around and. the stirrup-Irons ringing.
Without thinking, I had a shot at head
ing him with the doctor's mare, and
blocked him just enough to allow a
man who came galloping after to do
ttre rest.
"Thank ye, mister," growled the man,
a huge chap in a red-checked "shirt,
with a beard like W. G. Grace, but tho
very devil of an expression.
."'Been an accident?' said I, reining
up.
"'Ye?.' said he, scowling as though he
defied me to ask any more. '

"Well, there were heaps of gold In the
safe, but I only took what I needed and
could comfortably carry, not much more
than a couple of hundred altogether. Not
a note would I touch, and my native cau
tion came out also in the way I divided
tbe sovereigns between all. my pockets
and packed them up so that I shouldn't
be like the old woman of Banbury Cross.
â¢WÂ£ll, you think me too cautious still,
but I was insanely cautious then. And so
It was that, just as I was ready to go,
the moon had risen and was letting quite
a lot of light into the bank. I had. how
ever, brought a bit of candle with me
from my room, and in the strongroom,
which was down some narrow stairs be
hind the counter in the banking cham
ber, I had no hesitation in lighting It.
There was no window down there, and
though I could no longer hear old-Ew
bank enorlny I had not the slightest rea
son to anticipate disturbance from that
quarter. I did think of locking myself in
while I was at work, but, thank goodness,
the iron door had no keyhole on the in-
keep, the keys at night. . Of course I
thought he would take them with him
to his room; but no such thing; he had
a dodge worth two of that. What it
was doesn't much matter, but no out
sider would have found those keys in a
month of Sundays.
"I. of course, had them in a few sec

their count they, found that I had a rup

told them that in 18S8, some time after my
three hours* fight with Mitchell In

vere Illness got me and I was In my

with typhoid fever, gastric fever, inflam

It was in the latter part of- December,
1&8, that I chucked the crutches. Stick
a pin' in this date arid then remember
that on July 8, 18S9, I fought Jake Kilrain
at Richburg, Miss., that battle lasting
seventy-five rounds. .What do you think
of that? And I let that battle go seven
ty-five/rounds on purpose to show that .1
was able to go any distance any living
fighter could do. I'll tell you in my next
how I let Kilrain do air that was ln^ him
in that fight, holding off the knockout till
everybody was tired of the battle. Just to
show that I was "still the champion, and
the crutches didn't show in the count. â¢
I have brought out these: facts at this

WHEN I met the present King
Edward VII. then Prince of
Wales, in 18S7. I shook his flip

si ruck me as a sport of the
right sort, and we chinned one another
for two hours.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Sullivan," said the King
<then Prince) "that your people ever left
Ireland. You would be a credit to the
Britten empire as one of her Majesty's
subjects, as you certainly are to the
American republic, where I have many
true friends."
"My people didn't want to leave Ire
land, your Highness," said I, "but they
couldn't stay, not with their appetites."
"You meanâ"
"I mean that if I lived in Ireland a
year there'd be another famine there, that
there Isn't enough to feed the Sullivans
in that country; that's why so many of us
had to vamoose the ranch."
"You Irish-Americansâ if that is the
right way to say itâ are a fine blend, a.
f.ne bknd," said the Prince, smiling cor
dially. "You have caused us over here
tome trouble which we would have been
better off without."
"Yes, your Highness, it would have
been money in your pockets to have kept
the Irish just plain Irish. As plain Irish
they don't want much. As Americans
they want everything in sight."
And we chatted as i hail fellows well
met. I boxed at a private exhibition be
fore the Prince, there being about 250 per
sons present, and he admitted that he'd
Â£ot hfs money's worth.
When He Didn't Punch Kins Kdviard.
After my return home to Boston I was
telling a few friends about my meeting
with the Prince. It was along about St.
Patrick's day time when Irishmen feel
like "doing" everything English, and one
of my friends, a fellow who believes that
some day . England will be used as a
browsing place for Irish goats, got very
"much excited.
"Do ye mane to say yez were all thot
toime widdin arrum's reach of the bloody
tyrant?" he asked. \u25a0 >
"Sure I was, Dinny." . . .
"Oh. melia ' murther, what a chansL

"Let what go by?" . _ .
"The chanst to land on him. And you

Fiven hundred years of starvation and

ashamed. to tell it. If Oi'd been in yer -
place Id given it till him so he'd be willin*
to make Olreland free whin he kim out
av ut. th* robbln' invader."
My private opinion of the King is that
if he had his way he'd give Ireland free
dom, for he Is a pretty good sort and
would rather make friends than enemies.
But he has to keep his Job by doing what
he's told. If he tried to get gay with
things he wouldn't last as lo*hg in the
king business as a ham sandwich at a
Hebrew picnic. He's only a hired man.

thing of the kind, and the man who
stored away Jack Hoot and gave Fltz

career took a drop backward.
Both O'Brien and Gardner have coma
up through hard work. O'Brien went
away from Philadelphia, where he wasn't
appreciated, and walloped everything In
England. Gardner went away from home,
where he wasn't taken seriously, and
after hunting out the best men he could
fiad in Africa and Australia, came home
to make good. Foolish living Is dolns
them both up. I'd like to get the pair of
them together long enough to bat some
sense into them.
I've been through the mill and advice
from me on the score of silly living la

enough to take a brace and "come back."
If they don't brace they will both be
counted out very soon. This Is no pipe

Bubble-Blowers to the Tall Weed*.
The three-cornered taffy-passing sworry
goes on. Jeffries says Fitz Is the real
thing for heavyweight champ after him.
Fitz says Jeff Is a great man and .that
one J. Corbett 13 the greatest boxer the
world has ever seen. Corbett owsis up
that Fitz, a middleweight. Is a better
man than he Is a heavyweight, and he
says that Jeff Is a better man than I
am because he has fought us both and
ought to know, i Fudge, pish, tush, rats.
Fitz has delivered the goods and is en
titled to all he has. He never got his
reputation because of educated feet. But
Jeffries has not only sidestepped yours
truly, but he has ducked Marvin Hart
after a dozen promises to meet him. As
for Corbett, when he puts footracing be
fore stralgljt-and-above-board fighting ha
might as well try to prove that a cruiser,
is a better fighter than a .battleship be
cause it can run away from a fight.
Those who make a trade of fighting know
better. Had I been able to make Corbett
pause long enough In his running to let
me hand him one In his pantry pr on the
jaw he would have different . notions la
his noddle when he woke up. *

A ~ French '^Professor's Opinion of Ills
Voice.
When I was over in Paris I was taken
around a great deal and one of the places
I: visited was the studio of a teacher of
music. There was In the place a battery
of the finest pianos you ever saw. Think
ing, it was a good chance to have my voice
tested, so that if I wanted to go into fhe
ballet when I got old, I'd be ready, I gave
. the keys -of one of the pianos a right
: hook and â¢ roared out a few notes of a
song. \
Next morning he came around to see
me to show that there wasn't any hard
feelings. 7 and he invited me to look
through the mill where he worked- Just
before we: got to the mill there had been
an; accident, one of the workmen losing
â¢part of a hand in some gears. My oppo
nent of the night before explained to ma
how the accident occurred. .
When he stripped to take his medicine
the $500, he hoped) he sure was a

money quick. I let him have his way
for a . while, slipping past his hardest
'swings, 'and when he placeu his jaw
proper let him have it. Down he went m
a heap. â¢ He came back at me with . fine
spunk until I landed my*rlght on his ear.
"When he came out of it, and It was a
long time 'before he got on "earth again,
he asked :
"What place is this?" And then, "Did
I fall off'n the barn?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO:} SUNDAY CALt;
JOLTS FROM "JOHN L"/THE: Z SAN TRANCISCO;. SUNDAY )CAUI:
f~y OLOKEL HENRY BALCH. having
/ / acquired his military title from
I I*l his successful shaving of notes,
yr-s and having taken his place at the
â¢ crest of society in consequence of
the few thousands of dollars held tight
within his erasp. halted at the house of
LJmuel Jucklin and inquired of the old
man if he desired to sell a red steer that
\u25a0was walking about a small inclosure as
if he owned the place
"Get down." called out Jucklin.. "Come
in and we'll talk It over."
The colonel dismounted from his old
nag, came forward and seated himself
on a hide-bottomed chair in the hallway
that ran between the two sections of the
old loz house. LJmuel resumed his seat
in an Andrew Jackson rocker, made of
hickory saplings" "Well, how are things
out your way," he asked of his visitor.
The colonel, loosening a red woolen
6carf from about his Adam's-appled
throat, remarked that everything was at
a standstill, as the farmers must wait
on the. humor of nature before they could
do anything- "I was just thinking as I
came along,"' said he, '"that the farmer's
ie the hardest life of all. I've heard a
good deal of talk ever since 1 can 're
member about the freedom of the coun
try, but 1 haven't found it. They tell me
that my life has been a success, but I
don't know."
â¢â¢I think! I do know," the chicken
fighter replied.
The colonel, expecting a compliment,
smiled upon him and said, "Yes?"
"Yes, think I do know. It has been
about as near a failure as any man's life
could be."
"Why. Jucklin, what do you mean?"
"I mean that when a man at your time
of life rerrets having lived his life.' he
is ja failure. That's what I mean. ; You
are lamenting on~behalf of the farmer,
but you don't represent . him. He. lives
close to nature, but your - struggle has
becu to get away from It. You are a
fence-corner speculator."
"Everybody grants you the privilege of
saying what you please, so go ahead."
"Much obliged. Now let us look at him
for a moment. The farmer, ranges over
nearly all the landscape of life. In him
all of the emotions of human nature are
embodied. His world is his neighborhood
and every community contains every
shade of the human .mind, undeveloped,,
but there in the rough, you might say.
Children and old people love the country."
"Yes, but about that red steer?" '
"All right, we'll get to him pretty soon.
The man who has worked on a farm all
his life has just as many pleasures to
look back upon as the city merchant.
The farmer may in his time have bought
the fold brick, but may be the merchant
has been taken in by a bigger swindle.
And along toward the end they both have
something to think about. And that is
about all there is to lifeâ something to
think about. At a very early age wo
begin to live in the past. The farmer
has his past closer about him than other
men have. They have seen the same sea
sons pass over the same endeared fields."
"That is very true," the colonel ad
mitted. "Now what will you take for
that steer? 1 am in something â¢ of ~a
hurry."
"All right. I don't know of a finer
etecr anywhere than that one. But just
wait a moment. Let's get at the farmer
a little closer. In a small way, the suc
cessful farmer is a statesman. ' Experi-
ence is his 'guide, and we are, told;- that
all wisdom dates back to experience.^ It
is true that he doeEii't handle as much
monty as the banker, nor does he handle
as- niuch bread as , the baker, but the
baker can eat.only a certain amount, and
the/, money* that the banker handles
money-that can't relieve a real want of
natureâ ain't 'doin*. his soul any. particular
good. -The doctrine 1 of -.contentment is an
oldfoiie, 'but a" better; one , wasf never
preach'ed^7 : Ahd^the. farmer; ougnt- to \u0084be
the very model of contentmentl\:Ue would,
be if 'hel stopped '< to think. . Meh"that!'set
the world afire-die in the flames. Great
ness â¢at-'last^acknowledges its weakness.
In 'this ; there; is :. a valuable" lesson. It
should 'teach', us- to be contented. We
all ought to \ ask ourselves , this vital
question: \u25a0 What is success? It ain't noise,
tor] silence must follow, and ; Bilence can
last longer than: sound. -There never was
a"' storm as'long^as the calm. They that
find^happiness liT bluster wiir find misery
in quietude."; V J
."Tour lecture ia very good," said the
colonel, "but really, I should like to get
down to that steer.".
"We'll get down to him pretty soon.
But you spoke -about' the ; farmer, and
let ' us take one { thins at a time. The
steer- will- wait. .That Ms a part of his
duty toward man. Don't" let; him outdo
man in politeness. The greatest thing
about man is to teach ; some other man
something. Each man "Is | an' Illustrator
of life. And the farmer/ instead ot
bein' the joke of the ignorant folks
that ; live In towns,' ought to be en
vied by the philosopher. " He could
:give,at least 'half of his time In
.winter to fruitful .medltationr'and
:in ; doing j this he {would not only
; store lup contentment â¢ and . pleasure,
for himself in the future,; but out
of%it -might come great benefit to
mankind at large. Thought', is the
food of the soul. I remember when ;
old Sam Fersey was dyin'. I don't
"suppose there was a poorer man^in
the neighborhood. But some of the
. shallow-minded ri used ; to ; reproach
'him. for his happiness. "They said
he" was thoughtless. But the fact
,1s that he had more of ; the right'
sort ' of thought than any man for
> mites around. He worked' hard,
made' a.livln' and didn't grumble.
That "was thought to be some sort
iof mental dlsease^-the fact that he
;dfdft't complain; and a joker ' told
him' he'd better take somethin* for

found them and tried to make them
better and more cheerful. Well,
when he 'was lyin*. on his death

.particularly regretted. .'Yes.V he

""Who sent you the clipping?"
"Plympton. He still hunts In Michi

* "How it carried me back!" she sighed.
"Those lovely days in the open!"
-It was very late when John Browning
reached his hotel, but he did riot go to
bed 'until he had lighted a cigar and
lived over again the deer-hunting sea
son r of; seven years ago,. which a party
of Eastern people, including Vaughn.
Lyle and himself, had spent in North
ern Michigan..
â¢ Those were halcyon days when he and
Lyle had tramped over fields lightly
brushed with . snow, through thickets .
and in the b'rown forest in .pursuit of
deer. At night they would return tired,
happy and hungry ,to the big cabin,
ready to start out again in the morn
ing. Lyle had ever been a gay little
comrade with him. but up there In the
great northland. of ice and snow he be
gan to hope that he might not be too
old. after all, to ask her to be still more
than her,"father*s friend."
At the end of two weeks, however, he
acknowledged to himself his mistake. .
The party had secured a. new guide, a
handsome young. Canadian Frenchman,
with soft voice and lustrous eyes. He
knew every inch of ground and every
trick of deer-hunting.
" Lyle. romantic, "willful and head
strong, took snapshots of him in every
conceivable 'pose. She demanded his
services on all occasions and chatted
with him in French, a language not
understood by John Browning, who
was deeply concerned at the young
girl's fancy.
He reasoned with her . father one
night that the weather was getting al
together too severe for Lyle up there,
and it would be prudent for her to re
turn with the Crosbys the next day.
Vaughn -acquiesced. :-.- He' usually did
acquiesce in - any suggestion- from ;
Browning. - '
When her father announced to Lyle
the. next morning that she was to go
home that day, to Browning's surprise^
she did not False any objections. He
thought, though, that she seemed very
serious when he bade her adieu.
The. life and light went out of the
party for. him after her departure, and
he was glad when the season ended.
En route fo Lower Michigan he re
ceived a dispatch calling him farther
west on business, which detained him
until April. He arrived in New York to
learn that Lyle was in college. In the
latter part of the month war with
Spain was declared, and as an officer in
the National Guard he was mustered
into the United States service and went
to Cuba. Peace declared, he again re
turned to New York. This time Lyle.
and her parents were abroad. He fol-.
lowed* Just missing them at every place
in their erratic tour. â .
Then had come the war in Africa and
the "siren i song of the bullet" lured him
to the cause. of the Boers. Now he was
again in New York and was to see in
the morning his little friend of the long
ago' who had grown into a charming
woman. ' s
' She teased him when he came into
the "library " the , next morning: "Still
jealous of Plympton, John? You. were
such a stupidl Those cabin partitions
were regular sounding boards. I heard â¢
you counsel to papa about my, return.;
Of course the "severe weather* was not
the reason . you ordered 'removal from

"And weren't you?"

AFTER SEVEN YEARS - EVEN AS JACOB

{Copyright, 1904. by Belle Maniates.)
iN the Palm Room of the Waldorf
at a table partially obscured by a
lot of palms sat John Browning.
He was a man well past his" first
youth,' of form erect and face bronzed
by the sun that burned upon tropical
battlefields. From his rather remote
corner he scanned with interest every
one who eDtered.

A party of four were seating them
selves at -a table nearâ a man and
woman of middle age, a beautiful
young- woman with eyes that matched
the violets tsrxe carried, and a lemon

swinish. of eye. â
Browning was about to , start for
ward when a voice at the nearest
table spoke in subdued but carrying
tones: x
"Lyle Vaughan's fiance! The en-:
gagement is conceded, 'though not an^
nounced." Â«
.John Browning resumed his seat.
"It would have been far better," he
thought; "if I had not - called a halt
on her affection for the trapper. Any
thing but this specimen! He is a link
below the missing one!!' ; Â«
One of the voices at the next : table \u25a0
again had a hearingr
. "I admit he Is not a howling, suc

and antecedents." â
John Browning scowled ' and rcÂ°o

' Seven \u25a0 years since Lyle had ' her* first

f { T"T RANK." asked Gray, thousht-
Ly fully. "What is the proportion
rV. of the killed and injured in this
J^ service?"
"Crippled about one in five
and killed about one in ten."
"What becomes of the badly injured
ones? Do tlie companies make any pro
vision for them?" > â¢
"Somet'me?; a job calling, car checking,
or sealing, or the purgatory of a crossing
to watch: but as crossings would havo to
be thicker than rail joints to take care
of all of them. a. large proportion emerge
from the hospital to face a future of pov
erty and suffering. The boys working,
rrowever. arc- very loyal to their own. and
full many a smug social leader, with
charitable faOs, would raise their hands
in astonishment were th<y to know the
extent of the 'cheerful givers' of the
f^jrltch shanties. If true charity is self
facrlfico. there is full many a grimy
fallow in these yards to-day who is en
tithd to sit in the seats reserved for the
greatest of all. Last winter In Buffalo
three switchmen after paying their bills
had a few dollars apiece, it was the mid
dle of December and summer clothes
were uncomfortably porous, so they start
ed down Gencsee street to find Scotch
caps, gloves, arctics, etc. On the way
they ran up against a long absent com
panicnâan odd character well-known all
over the country as always making good
his boast of 'never staying over ten days
in a place'â tho boys noticed with pity the
empty coat sleeve flapping In the bitter
wind.
"Poor eld Jimmy had, a few days be
fore, been discharged from the Cleveland
Hospital; the company had no place he
could fill; a common enough story, but
one that never fails upon a cold void,
when heard by men like his hearers. A
gleam of mutual understanding, and when
an hour later three busted boys tenderly
bade farewell to a warmly clothed per-
Eon, in the pocket of whose comfortable
trousers jingled a handful of silver, they
had no feeling in the matter other than
a pleasant duty willingly performed; but
1 think in the great city that night many
a widely heralded philanthrophist or
charity ball organizer would have dipped
deeply into ; their surplus treasures, or,
even exchanged warm beds and luxurious
surroundings with the three thinly clad
forms > bravely facing with frost-nipped
ears- and stinging fingers the arctic waves
of the wind-swept yard, could they have
seen the approving benison of the pierced
hand or heard the brotherly love quiver
ing in the divine 'to the least of these.' "
Gray looked upon the grave glowing
face a moment, then said; "Frank,. I
sometimes wonder if this life will fill my
ideals as completely as it does yours."
"If I'd had any like thoughts about it,
our acquaintance would never have pro
gressed beyond the guord incident," re
joined Howe quietly. Then silence fell
between the friends; to be broken after
a few moments by Howe saying:
"Well, it's well toward supper time and
Girlie ought to be back. Shall we go the
place of the descendants?"
"All right." replied Gray, then arising
they started for "Mammy's," each feel
ing he had a new and better knowledge
of the other. As they reached the house
they encountered "Mammy." a large
empty market basket on her arm.
"Been marketing?" asked Howe.
"Yes," answered the old lady, "crab
fashion. I got a thinking of the poor hun
gry boys > so I filled my basket and went
down in the yard, and I'll bet a strike
wouldn't have stopped things better. But
come up. The night gang will be getting
up."
"Have you seen anything of Girlie?"
asked Gray.
"No, bad cess to him. I only hope I
can get supper. over before the villain
chows up," exclaimed Mammy, wrath
fully.
Entering the living room they found It
occupied by several sleepy young men, all
growling hungrily for suppjer. After
seating themselves In a corner, Howe
looked the group over and. turning to
Gray, he said, in a hushed whisper: "See
that tall fellow standing at the window
well, that's 'Scranton Pete,' of whom I
was talking to-day."
Gray saw a tall, gra\-e man of about
forty years; one who seemed to stand
aloof from his fellows and who was evi
dently respected. None of the rude jokes
or rougn horse play was directed his way.
As he stood silently looking out of the
\u25a0window unheeding the noisy buzz behind
him, there was something very strong and
gTa\*e in the poise of the head and steady
Eet of the shoulders.
"His dear 'Girlie* is late," elyly re
marked a young man with furtive evil
eyes, "and the old man is thinking of go
ing after him."
His companion jerked his chair harshly
away, muttering. "I wish he had heard
you."
Here "Mammy" threw the dining-room
door open, saying, "Come on, ye wolves."
The "wolves" crowded, a noisy hurtling
drove, into the room, followed by the tall
taciturn Pete.
As the boys entered the room "Mam
my" drew out a couple of chairs, saying,
"Here are yer places and the rule of the
house is that yer eat here and here only.
If ye find a man In yer place he !s looking
for trouble, and if ye leave him there yer
pays double board and cats the scraps of
a second table."
"A nice way to encourage trouble."
commented Howe.
Stating themselves before the generous
supply of plain, well cooked food they fell
to. Gray, however, was more interested
in the scraps of conversation than in the
cabbage and potatoes. . .

him a look full of loving congratulation
and they resumed ' the interrupted meal. ,

bells and shrieking whistles. They .sat si

a fierce- roar from an unseen stack, then
an Inverted Niagara of fire pours against
the smoke-curtained night. \Then silence

\u25a0' "Something wrong down there, let's go

They -stumbled quickly down the em
bankment and after-a swift run along the
tracks : ;came to a place where a motley,
swiftly ' absorbing crowd collected, vul
r around a yard engine. On its
s outskirts i a dark, foreign-looking woman
-with black, streaming hair was endeavor
ing to quiet a frightened, sobbing girl of
aboxit'6 years.

man -who with craning neck stood on the
pilot, beam.
"A switchman has got both legs cut off

The human wall surged. Through a rift
In. the crowding forms Howe caught a

enters the 'solemnity of wide space, the

,"SoI thought then." replied Law

me intently, a look of deep compassion on

"Dear old Dick. I stayed with him all
winter, then when spring came the cries
of the* mourning doves and sagehena
drove me frantic. So one day I start
ed back to the old life. Heavily bearded
and loughly attired. I had no fear of be
ing recognized. After lots of varied ex
periences I- found myself in the Pennsyl
vania coalfields. One nlsht I walked
into a yard office at Scranton and asked
for a job switchingâ no trouble to get it.
I well knew that with the murderou3
contrivances operated by the railways
of that locality these yards were veri
table slaughter pens, but boys,'* hero
the voice took a deeper tinge, "if was
what I wanted. I, however, came through
all right, and in a short time, by-^my in
different recklessness acquired the so
briquet by which I'm known.
"About two years since I met the boy
who died . last night. From the first I
was attracted to him by his high spir
its and affectionate nature, then' as I
grew to know him he entered as a ray
of sunshine Into my darkened . life.
When I accompanied htm home last fall
I was in the same morbid gloomy state
that my awful experience bad placed mo
âa being whose dark past clouded both
present acd future. The bright houso
with Its loving home life was as gall to
me. Too much might have been about
It. The evening prior to our intended
departure Judge Mason asked me to
step into his library. Entering; he crossed
to stand before the fireplace. I can
see the scene yet â the erect form, with
heavy ' white hair surrounding the
thoughtful brow and grave, steadfast
face, the cozy, brilliant room, the walls
deeply booklined, and even the .crackle
of the hickory fire are- ever present In
my memory.
" 'Be seated,' he said, motioning me to
a great easy chair; 'my duties have, I
think, made me a good judge of men. and
I am very glad you are my son's friend.
Your face and eyes tell me that you havo
passedâ and successfully â through tho bit
ter waters in which my poor boy Is en
gulfed. Now, my hands are tied, but 'can
you, to . whom 1 give him as a younger
brother, go out into his life and- stay by
him?' '- â¢: ' â¢ ,
"I clasped the extended hand, my 'yes*
was to m: as though uttered before the
highest altar. . . .
"Now," Lawrence continued, arising.
"Howe, when he is at his home I want
you to take Judce Mason into the room
where the coffin is placed and say to him
those words: 'The wandering outcast to
whom you gave this boy was In word and
deed faithful to the trust, and when he
died his head was on his breast, the last
words coupled his name with yours.*"
-Howe bowed his head In assent. Law
rence resumed: ,
"When Ward was killed he left a help
less mother In his little home "town" in
California. I wrote to the" pastor of her
church and arranged to "each month send
her all I could spare. Aryear ago she
died, not without, however, i sending me
a message of blessing. 'I am now free
from all claims and Intend to go back to
the old life."
"In what way?" asked Gray.
"This way," answered Lawrence: -\u25a0' **I
have a friend In the Inter-Mountain who
has always believed in me. I wired him
last night for transportation for myself
and one. Gray, go with me. Howe. I'll
fix "it so you can join us on your return.
Then I'll try to redeem the past."
Howe said quickly, "All right.' John: it
will be the best for both. But there is tha
call to breakfast." i . >
The dining-room seemed another place.
"The quiet- faced, silent men "whose eyes
followed Lawrence's tall form with'com
â¢ passionate eyes were In wide ' contrast to
the noisy ."gang" of the preceding meal.
-Mammy was nowhere .visible, the ill
cooked food was being 'served by a slat
ternly Polish woman. After the quiet
meal Lawrence arose and crossing to
mammy's room knocked oh the door. Re
ceiving'an answer he said: ' â¢ \
â¢ "Mrs. Sullivani I am going down: to
,the undertaker's; don't you want to see
our boy ?" -- , ,
\ In \u25a0' a few minutes Mammy emerged.
\u25a0 and many a brave eye dimmed aa they,

"Come," said Lawrence, placing hia

fccranton wit silent at the foot of the 1
table, but John noticed. at every foottall
in the hall, or slam of door, an eager, ex
ptctant look flash over the impassive face
and wondered If he, too. was under the
spell of the "young devil."
Supper was nearly over when the fel
low who had previously commented upon
Scranton started to address him, but
changing his mind, looked at Howe, who
sat opposite: then, In an impudent, sneer
ing voice, said: â¢
"Say, you fellow, with the mug of a
sky pilot, where did you run in from?"
Howe quietly answered, giving the re
quired information correctly.; but the
courtesy only seemed to encourage the
bully to further insults. "An Eastern
man usually succeeds better in herding
calves than cars in this country," he
continued, adding, "where did you pick
up your mullet-headed partner?" .
Howe noticed John's great hand close
with an almost audible snap. but. kick
ing his foot, answered, "From Virginia."
"Oh," came the contemptuous answer,
"a cussed rebel or the son' of one?"
Then happened a thing that Howe
never forgot. He saw Gray rise slowly,
his face like an icy mask, and when,
amidst the surprised silence, he stretched
forth a restraining hand, it was thrown
back with a savage, dislocating jerk,
while a nev.-,' strange voice, said sternly:
"That will do, Mr. Howe; this is my
Job." .
As he walked slowly around the table
heads were raised in surprised wonder
and mingled resentment â the rebellion of
a "greeny" was usually put down by
concerted actionâ but while a few at
tempted to rise, none did soâ a look at
the set face and straight lips, an incar
nate vengeance, was enough. . Passing
Scranton, Gray walked to where his tn
sulter sat. Stretching out his hand he
laid it upon the shoulder: then
for a moment stood gazing silently down
into the frightened eyes. To Howe, sit
ting opposite, came an old reminiscence.
"When a boy he had, in a dark swamp,
encountered. a rattlesnake: a heavy pole
quickly pinned the enraged serpent to
the ground; then, boy-like, he had
knelt at a close distance to further
tantalize his terrible captive; now
as he looked upon the scene before him,
a shuddering sense of similarity swept
along his spine; the concentrated men
ace of the poise of the head" and deadly
gleam of eye was terrible akin; again
swept over him a chill knowledge of the
near presence of death. With an odd
juniclt: of a strained arrow-like head,
malignant, blazing eyes, and 'dark,
sweeping laurel, he heard John's steady
voice sa; r : \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0
."Stand up. I wish to talk to you. What
is your name? Well, Mr. Long."
Casting an appealing look along the
table Long with blanched cheek and
hanging jaw obeys. heavily built
young man who sat next, arises, Baying:}
" greeny must want to run the
house." steps up behind him.
As Howe kicks his chair back, a vi
brant voice from the foot of the table
rings out: "Sit down! The first man
that lips in deals with me," and Scran
ton's heavy fist clashes on the table; In
the enduing silence Gray lays his hand
again on Long's shoulder, then In the
low. gentle voice of a father chiding an
erring child, says:
"Mr. Long, the remark you made . a
moment ago is one I cannot pass by. My
father was a Confederate soldier and a
good one, too. â¢ I. as his son and a son of
Virginia, believe that he and his com
rades were very far from being rebels,
only men, acting upon a deep conviction
of rightâ one of the rare epochs of trie
world, when conscience made as naught,
wealth, station or personal consideration.
Probably you can understand how I take
it when, in addition to contempt, you ap
ply, a curse to them. Now when f first
got up it was with the intention of"â
here the hand closed viciously upon the
shoulder, while the thumb strayed to
ward the shrinking throatâ "breaking
your neck, but I cannot do It; you are a
coward and a slink and, as such are
tabooed to a gentleman. Â» But remember
this, if you Were to disgrace this earth
until your hair becomes as white as your
heart you will never stand closer to death
than- you have in the last few minutes."
Under the strange magnetism of the
low blasting words every - face ' blanched
as though brushed by the visible trail of
the "sable robe." Turning, his eyes full
upon "Mammy," who from her seat at
the head of the table was regarding him
In breathless excitement, a wave of con
trition swept over his face as in boyish
appeal he said.- "Pardon me, madam, for
the language 1 have used in your pres
ence. I'm sorry to say I forget every
thing a moment ago; it will not happen
again." .
"I rather think not!" thought Howe.
"Mammy" arose, then with flushed,
cheek stood leaning on the back of her.
chair. â¢ ' ,v, v - ,i
"My boy," she answered with a new
dignity that sat well upon the massive
shoulders, "you did right. I say black
shame upon the boy who would do other- .
wise when his father is cursed before
him; as to you. Long," extending a great'
hand toward him, "git yer duds together
and skin out of here as quick as the devil'
will let you, and If ye have any friends In
the gang let them go with you." -...,...
Long arose, ran his eyes; along the
table, but all' remained seated, then,
turning he passed, out alone. â¢ ;;.-'\u25a0
John felt a . hand upon his . shoulder.
Turning, he looked directly into a pair of
deep eyes. He had heard his father; tell. \u25a0
of. men who believed that imprisoned :
within the cells of being were souls who
carry the misty recollection of previous"
lives, and at times two would meet: and
recognize, each behind the transparent
barriers, in a lonely captive one whom in
long past ages they had loved and" trust
ed ; and from that meeting the fancy to
him was almost belief.
"My . boy," said a deep, kindly, voice,
â¢Tm'known here as Scranton -Pete. .My '.
name is Peter Lawrence."
Here a little. stir ran along the table,-:
and the "gang" looked a mutual surprise. '

on:
"But â they don't stay married; they

I had asked Gretchen what becomes
of all the chorus girls. â
That has always been a fascinating
Snystery to me.
Of course, when you are very young
and have never been any nearer to the
beguiling chorus than your opera
glasses will bring you. still young
enough, I mean, to believe everything
you Bee in print because it is in print
â and not understand half of it, you
know exactly what becomes of the cho
rus girls. You know so many things
exactly at that age.
You sit so demurely in your orches
tra seat, under your mama's or your
chaperone's wing, so demurely that the
admiring blase world looking at you Is
sure that butter wouldn't melt in your
mouth, and In your mind's eye you see
the chorus girl, that creature of de
lightful audacity in dress and abandon
In movement upon the stage, being
whirled away from the stage door in
an enchanted carriage to an enchanted
existence of delirious excitement and
luxury and adulation:
You never picture her . in her hall
bedroom, sitting on the side of her lit
tle Iron bed, easy in her 75-cent kl
mona -with her hair braided down her
back, eating 1 her midnight supper out
of & cracker jar and a deviled ham tin
sumptuously arranged upon the top of
her trunk.
You never "Dicture her wiping the
dinner dishes for her mother before
she hurries to the theater on a street
carâ if she is lucky enough to have a
home.
You never picture her snuggling
to his elbow and walking home with
the stage carpenter or the property
man, or that unromantlc. Impecunious
â¢ brown bird the man of the chorus, and
figuring out ways and means of fur
nishing a three-room flat.
Nor going to 6 o'clock mass every
morning in Lent and knitting bedroom
slippers for needy friends as a Lenten
dutyâ as I remember one - New York
chorus girl doing, a chorus girl who Is
now a leading soprano with a salary In
three figures.
Nor going to 11 o'clock service every
Sunday morning: with her motherâ as one
cf the prettiest of the Tivoli girls doesâ
and reverently making the responses with
the same sweet voice she tra-la-las
with in "The Tenderfoot/.'
"There you have the secret of what In
comes of the cho rust girls. There's noth
ing so very, wonderful about It. is there?"
Just fancy, qh ye wide-eyed ingenue, ye
Kosslp-eycd Johnny, ye green-eyed wo

that" glittering â¢ incandescent life, in
.which- she la so alluring. â¢â¢ to haggle
.with the butcher and the grocer, to
save for the rent day and watch for
holes In socks and the stair carpet!
It. is very prosaic, isn't It?
It doesn't seem possible, does it?
.Yet Gretchen. who surely ought to
know, who has seen it come to pass with
her own eyes, not ence. but many times,
says that this is trueâ that this Is what
becorne3 of. the chorus girls, usually, and,
what's worse, she says, "child â¢ of the
theater" as she . Is, that If she ; te*Â£ had
her own, way she would never. have gone
on the stag's, and never would encourage
a girl to "go on the stage. Â«
Of course, this 13 only Gretchan'3
point' of view.
- The , stajce-struck girl, all suspicion*
womankind and -Johnny himself, no
matter. how much, nor how earnestly and
honestly Gretchen may disclaim, you may
be r Bure.l,**win cling T to their pet deluÂ«t<"Â»
"There's not much magic in the aver
age chorus girl's careerâ at least here in
San Francisco, and I think not anywhere.
"They make mistakes and have their
disappointments and troubles, their likes
and dislikes Just like any girls. When
they leave the stage and go broke they
come back because this is, as a rule, the
only thing they can do. and they usual
ly go broke very soon, for they're easy
with their money and don't save."
"And the automobiles and diamonds?"
"Not enough to go aroundâ the averagÂ»
chorus girl doesn't have them."
"But Truly Shattuckr*
"Oh, Truly Shattuck." and Gretchen
looked dour and tight as a clam.
"If you want to know just exactly what
becomes of the chorus girls we can take
our old Tlvoll chorus of twelve for ex
ample." I can account for every_ one of
them and that will show:
"There was Julia Simmonsâ she*Â» living
right here in the city now; she married
a stage carpenter and she's happily mar
ried I trink.
"There was Carrie Pfeifferâ she's
married here, too, and living with her
husband, a business man of some sort.
I forget just what, but not rich.
"There were the three Valersa*-onÂ»
of them is dead. Tilly married a mu
sician, and is living in Oakland. Mina
married a real estate man. '
"There were the three Stockmeyersâ
. Freddie is dead ; she married Geori*
Wood, the minstrel man. Lottie married
Harry Norman, the barytone. Mlnnia
married an officer on the police force here.
T ' "There was Emily Pozessiâ she marriod
a chorus man at the old Tivoli.
"I ; married and left the chorus, nevtr
to go back againâ as a chorus girlâ and
I didn't marry rich.' My husband be
came an invalid and I went -to work
sewing, dressmaking, until I sot tha posi
tion I have. here. That accounts for ms
âand I'm just a fair example.
"The only one that's left is Lillian Law
renceâshe is leading lady at tha Alcazar
now. ;
Perley, the erratic manager, and retired.
Lottie Stockmeyer of our old chorus
married Harry Norman, the barytone.
Quite a number of girls have married
fairly well, comfortably, but not bril
liantly." \u25a0
"And, how about the attentions and the
gilded youth?"
"The old Tivoli chorus wasn't good
looking enough to be In very- much dan
ger, and now. when looks count more
than anything else In the chorus, tha
management doesn't allow notes and vls
, Itors behind the scenes. Sometimes a girl
attracts attention: sometimes a girt goes
into the chorus for the sake of attract
ing attention, but if that sort of -thing
counts for more than her work" Â«he
doesn't last lons in the chorus. Those
girls come and go. So very often do the
girls who are ambitious to rise quickly;
â¢they will leave the chorus for vaude

wlM'be stars right away, and when they're
* disappointed they come back. Some
times they marry in 'the companyâAmy

The arrangements for the housing and
entertaining the visiting members have
been most complete. Nothing will be left
undone to make the convention in this
city a memorable one. A series of excur
sions, banquets and high jinks have been
arranged and California hospitality will
be dealt out in generous doses.
One of the most important features of
every convention is the- souvenir book.
For several years O. A. Sontag of Wash

of this work. How well he has succeeded
in his task is i testified to by ' the most
handsome production of. the printer's art
seen in the West. A special cover fii gold,
symbolic d? the State, has been prepared
by Langutu. the -well-known illustrator.
Against a background of gold in a wreath
of palms, the Golden Gate is depicted. A

subordinate bodies scattered over thÂ«

objects of the organization are to promote
the best interests of the trade, to s-cure
- living wages and to discuss all matters
appertaining to the elevation of the mem
bers. -_ \u25a0 : ,
One of the most Important matters to
come before the convention is the discus
sion of the ultimatum issued by the local
typutbetae that after July 1 the hours ef
labor will be increased from eight to
nine at the same scale of wages. Thei
action of the local unions will depend
i!P3ii the result of the convention. An
eight-hour day throughout the United
S'.ates is to be a principal topic of dis
cussion. On this subject President Hig
ginj of t-e International U,nion says in
his annual message: -
" "One of the most delicate problems now
confronting us as an organization, aside
< from our baunden duty as an organiz

: "Our Cincinnati convention went on

important and. on our part, economic de
sire, and on the part of all fair and hon

sirous of getting as much out of life.
without becoming business failures or so

UNHERALDED by any of the glit
ter and pomp that has character
ized many of the organizations
that have made San Francisco fa
mous as the "Convention City" of
America, the representatives, of the In
ternational Printing Pressmen and -As
sistants* Union of North America have
come quietly and unostentatiously to
town to gather for the seventeenth time
in annual convention from June 19 to 24
inclusive.
To the average < itizen unfamiliar with
the purpose of the organization or the na
ture of the craft, thia is not of great im
port. Beyond v pardor.ubJe pride in the
ihoyght "..hat this city n-is again been se
lected for convention purposes and for
the nrst lime by the pressmen, he is in
different and rests content with the
knov.-ledjre that another "union" is hold
ing an annual gathering. Did he but
know, however, that the 300 delegates as
sembled within the city's gates directly
r^prÂ«Â»sent over 20.00;} of the men who have
been almost as potent a factor in
the development and civilization of the
w oriel as the Holy -Writ, his interest
v.ou!C be awakened. As a tribute to the
mechanical genius of the members of the
1. P., P. and A. U. the development of
the printing press to its marvelous state
of efficiency stands as an everlasting mon
umtnt.
During the sixteen years following the
organization of the pressmen, San Fran
cisco waÂ« entirely overlooked as a con
vention place, partly because an invita
tion had never been extended and owing
to the distance from the Eastern centers.
With the enthusiasm thai is character
istic of the average Californian, the dele
gates to the annual convention at St.
Louis last year determined that the print
ing pressmen should hold their next con
vention in San Francisco, v.ith the result
that Mayor E. E. Schmitz will formally
turn over the keys of the city to the dele
gates to-morrow in Eagles' Hall.
It was no small undertaking that was
imposed upon the local unions to bear
the expense of bringing 200 of their fellow
craftsmen to the Pacific Coast and the
effective work of the convention commit
tee has been responsible for the success
ful outcome.

AND ASSISTANTS
UNIONwhite lingerie petticoats imply a large
wardrobe of them for very frequent
changing, but the changeable ruffle is
a simple device which relieves the sit
uation greatly. On a plain white petti
coat made to reach a little below the
knee, a beading, about an inch wide, is
sewed, and on this beading two or threÂ«
flounces, deep enough to give a proper
length to the skirt, are attached. The
top of the flounce should have the same
kind of bcadiug as the skirt, and with
a ribbon of the right width those two
headings can be run together. The
flounces can be made as dainty and as
elaborate as desired. Many society
women in San Francisco, who are noted
for their neatness and for their ele
gance, have adopted this changeable
jlouncÂ« skirt. - f
For this summer skirts appeal to be
very elaborate. .In the large illustra
tion is shown a very richly embroi
dered petticoat. It is French, hand
made and hand embroidered, and it is
made cf thin lawn. It will be seen
that the flounce is put on considerably
above the knee, with a piece of Inch
\u25a0vvide lace insertion, under which is run
a strip of wash ribbon, lied in a. large
bow on the side. The t-mbroidery of
the flounce is of a largo, lily pattern
and very btautlful. A little above the
top of the shoe, a piece of Inch-and-a
half-wide Insertion is let In. and on
that is sewed a strip o* lawn which
carries the lace ruffle at the bottom of
the skirt. Under this ruffle there arc
two others, the first having a deep
hem. and the second one edged with
narrow lace. A tklrt of this descrip
tion is so elaborate that when worn
with a dressing sacquc It will appear to
be a dress-skirt. The little Kacque worn
\u25a0with it, as shown in the illustration, is '
a very dainty affair. It is'madc of baby
blue surah silk. The yoke and top of the
sleeves have very small tucks close to
gether, and the neck is finished by a
piece of lace insertion, which is car
ried down the front and around the -
bottom of the yoke and sleeves. The
silk is accordion plaited . and . hangs
loosely from the bottom of the yoke
to a little below the waist, where it is
finished off. by a lace ruffle. The sleeves
have a large accordion plaited flounce
hanging loosely from a little above the
elbow, and they are also finished with
lare ruffles. The sacque has a loose
lining of eoft silk, buttoning down in
front. A matinee of this style is meant
for bedroom' wear.

This, of course, had been In the days
of provincialism, before Banker'Kar
sens had come to the city to prosper
and die a millionaire. His son, Her
bert, had only the haziest memory of
the flitting of Minton, the little home
town, and - haziest of all. of Mildred,
as a wisp of long, white clothes with
something red and squirmy at the top
of them, which he had been bidden to
kiss, but from which he had turned
away in disgust, sticking small fists
Into his first pair of pockets and say-
Ing grandly: "I'm a man nowâ don't
kiss. girls any more." ' â¢.
Until two hours before they were to
leave Ilidaway. the Barton country
house, he told himself the Gore girl
was out of the question.
(Copyrigtt? 1905. by Martha McCulloch
r Williams.)
{"T>HE "mischief was done all in a
I minute. Fate perhaps knew how.
I .Karsens certainly was all In the
\u25a0I dark and as angry as he was
amazed to find himself in Cupid's
toils. He had got almost through this
house party, as through a hundred
others, -scot free.- unburdened by more
than: passing memories of black eyes,
or gray, or blue.' Indeed, he had passed
up Mildred Gore as impossible two
minutes after he took'her in to dinner;
regretfully, too. â¢It was on many
counts so desirable that he should find
iii'-her the' woman he" wished to marry.
She was 'his equal in birth, in for
tune," in position; his people approved
her thoroughly, moreoVer there had de
scended to him a burden of obligation
to her, blood; which it was impossible
that money could discharge. Her father
had come ti his father's rescue In a
day .of trouble that otherwise must
have ended in disaster, forcing his way
through a mob of clamoring depositors
In the elder Karsens' bank, with bags of
gold in cither hand' and a ready promise
of ten times as much at need. That had
stopped the. senseless run. Men who had
been ready to fight for their money had
begged abjectly to have~it kept In the
vaults.
thick under note. "Mildred. Mildred!" ho
went on. "I have been blind this ten
days â now that I see â is it quite too
late?"
"I don't understand," Mildred said,
suddenly prim and pale.
Karsens stood staring after the van
ishing figure in a scowling daze. He was
angry clean through. If it was Fate's
decree that he should be thus bowled
over, why had it not come to pass at
first?
There was also the man in the locket
she had blushed, furiously when Dicky
told of him. Who could he be?
She was, after all. the wife for him.
yet they had given her no chance. He
had been likewise defraudedâ how was he
to know that aught so nunllke could
soften and brighten like a gray sky at
dawn? Until train time he asked hlmselr
these things, and many more, over and
over. He meant to have them answered
in part before he got back to the city.
There fate balked him. At the very last
minuts Mildred decided to stay another
day. Dicky howled delight and triumph
when he heard it and Instantly carried
her off from everybody. Karsens made
his adieus with what grace he might and
went home more than ever dazed.
He did ! not sleep that night. Next day
betimes he sped him back to Hldaway.
He found the house deserted. 1 Mrs. Bar
ton was out driving, said the butler. Miss
Gore? He was not sure; she might be In
the grounds; she was not in her own
room nor anywhere about the house.
Wherever she might be. Master Dicky,
was with her. Karsens * waited to hear
nothing more. He plunged into the shrub
bery, took a short cut that led to the plna
grove and came out at the edge of \u25a0It
breathless, yet content. For he heard
voice 3 through the murmuring stillness of
Itâ Dicky's shrill and gleeful. Mildred's
touched with pleading, yet wholly good
humored. Karsens crept noiselessly to
ward the pair, stopped in. the ambush of
a big pine, six feet away and listened
shamelessly to what was said, having
much ado the while to keep himself from
laughing.
Mrs. Barton doted on antiques; she had
astounded the countryside by paying;
fabulously for all manner of track, an
cient and weather-beaten. Thus It hap
pened she had bought from the town
authorities the old stocks rummaged out
when the town hall was rebuilt and had
set them up in the pines* arranging them
so strollers might sit on them and hear
the tale of them. Adventurers even put
their feet in the allotted spaces of tim
bers still stanch. Thus Dicky had learned
the trick. He had played It this morning
himself, then persuaded Mildred to do ths
same. When her feet were nicely settled
he slapped down the upper half, fastened
it tight and said: "Now you are my pris
oner. I will not let you out untilâ"
"Until what, Dicky dear?" Mildred
had asked, laughing heartily. She was
asking It still when Karsens came In
sight.' Dicky seemed pondering deeply.
"It's not fair to ask two things for one."
he said at last; "and I want to ask two..
I don't know just yet which I want
worst."
T "Oh well! Then I'll go to sleep and let
you find out," Mildred said, pretending
to sign deeply, although Karsens was
sure her eyes were dancing. Dicky went
very near her.' "You better not." ho
said; "'cause if you do I mightn't have
to ask hut one."
"Indeed: Tell me what they are! May
be I can decide which of them you ought
to care most about." Mildred said, coax-
Ingly. Dicky shook his head. "1 know
all by myselfâ now." he said. " 'cause
if I said you must stay here always you
couldn't. We're only here for summer
time., So . you've' got to show meâ the
man In the locket. If you don't I'll keep
you here till mamma comes to find us.
Thenâ she will punish me, and you'll be
mighty sorry."
"So sorry I cannot possibly let It hap
pen." Mildred said, with a bubbling laugh.
Karsens heard the faint click of a spring,
then Dicky's sorrowful shout: "Why. it' 3
nobody in* the/ world but that silly Bert
Karsens! What do you want wiih him.
â¢ Mllly?. I know I'm ever so much better
looking!"
VNot a doubt of it." Karsens said, rush
ing forward and kneeling' beside Dicky' 9
prisoner.' The tell-tale locket lay open
face down in her lap. where It had fallen
from her nerveless fingers. -: 'As he closed
it. after. one glance, he: saicÂ» ln Mildred's
ear: "Darling, if you kept that thins
' maybe I can persuade you." after a long,
long! time, to take the original."
" "Not unless your mother says soâ she
sent me the picture." Mildred whispered.
Dicky -had scampered - oft. As Karsens
set her free he drew her hand over his
arm,' saying, with a shake. of thÂ« head:
"You're much too dangerous to bÂ« left
at large: ; I- shall keep you" prisoner all
the rest of your life." -

MARTHA MCCULLOCH-WILLIAMS
WHEN I was In Paris last year I
had the pleasure of seeing the
Countess of Portales, a most
charming woman. -and she ir
tercsted me greatly, partly 3e
cave she was an American girl, and
partly, or rather chiefly, on account ci
her personal charm. She came from the
South, and had the Southern manner,
which is always so attractive. I was tod
that when she was a debutante she Â«sis
homewhat famous for her dresses ;n:iÂ«l; n:iÂ«l
especially for her lingerie, which t.-js
h*r jrreatr&t care, and on which she
.--rendered ail her pSn-moncy. Her beauti
ful skin?, made of lacs and embroidery,
caught the eve of Â«* Frenchman, who was
traveling in America, with the happy re
sult that this pretty girl became iiie
Countess of Portaies, and a member of
the highest society of Paris. She still
retains her love oi" dress, and still de
votes a great deal of attention to the
lingerie. But ordinarily. American girls
do not iM^haP 55 understand
The winning wave tdr^c rvirg note) .

Or do .jot realize that it
Dcs more bewitch one than nhen art
Is too precise in cvtry part.
They tan learn a lesson from the Parisi
etine. who by nature loves everything
dainty, and delights in everything thot
excites admiration. It is impossible In
"The Story of Fashion" to avoid a' fr*
ciuent recurrence to Paris, for that is
where Fashion holds undisputed sway,
which gradually extends its empire and
cists* its glamour over all the other coun
tries of the earth. The Parisian woman
of fashion spends as much time and al
most a.s much money on her lingerie, her
petticoats, and her lace ruffles, as she
does on her gowns, and she fully real
izes the effect which these articles of
dress produce. One can hardly blame her
if she manages occasionally to show in a
modest way the beauties of these dainty
flounces and ruffles and laces.
li should not be assumed that petti
coat;? are mere';; petticoats, with few
variations in style or material. On the
contrary, there are a great many styles.
The skirt made with a changeable ruf
fle is a most convenient style. Plain
pretty. It Is made of nainsook and from
the knee to the bottom of the' skirt eight
rows of one-inch wide lace insertion are
set in. A lace ruffle, matching the inser
tion, is sewed to the bottom of the skirt.
On each side of this petticoat there are
six embroidered buttonholes, through
which colored ribbon, with a bow at each
end. can be laced in, making a remark
ably pretty effect. The matinee intended
to be worn with this skirt is quite sim
ple, but altogether charming. It is made
of white silk crepe, tucked on the shoul
ders and hanging straight down to a- lit
tle below the waist. The sleeves are
made of two large ruffles of lace. ' A
sacouc like this can bt tvorn in the bed
room at any time.
Another very elaborate ; French petti
coat has a. panel of embroidery up the
front and In the one shown in. another'
of the illustrations, the - pattern, in the'
panci is of clover leaves, running up the
front breadth way above the knee. This
pattern is also carried out' around the
bottom or the skirt. ;md the effect of the
front panel is very pretty. This. 'petticoat
Js 'finished off on the bottom by a narrow
scalloped flounce, about six ; inches in
depth, and with an underflounce' having
an edging of lace on it. A very summery
dressing sacque is worn with .this skirt.
It is made of the very softest white silk,
with a dainty pattern of mess rosebuds in
pink and green. The fashioning of ' it is
quite piain. as it liangs ''loosely from the
shoulders, where it is shirred a little
down the seams. The neck has a little
Hat collar of; lrish lace. Then it opens
down the front and is tied together hi
three places with satin ribbon. The
sleeves are^three-quarter length and are
made of net lace, very full and in two
flounces.
For afternoon tea a sacque is permissi
ble under certain conditionsâ for example,
if one is very tired and if nobody but in- .
timate friends is present. In such cases a
sacque that is belted in at the waist is
the best style. Quite a pretty sacque 6f
this kind is shown in the illustration ot
the "Afternoon tea in your room." It is
a mauve china silk sacque and is made
shown in one of the illustrations, is called
an all-lace petticoat, and is exceedingly

HOWEVER comfortable flat or
suburban cottage may be,
the residents commit a
serious blunder who live
in either all the year round -without
changing air or scene. The phil
anthropist who pronounced the man
â¢who -works seven days in the week
a fool, because a sinner against his
health and reason, was wise in his
generation.
As grave a charge may be brought
against those who, finding no other
place as comfortable as home, settle
down upon the lazy lees of present
content and, as the old people used
to put it, "never get out of the
smoke ot their own chimneys*' from
one years end to another.
They are right in one respect.
Our sensible householders may as
\u25a0well make up their minds first as
last to the truth that "there's no
place like home." Change of air
*and'scene are sanitary and remedial
measures, and often heroic. To
make the change as tolerable as
possible requires the exercise and
the practice of much philosophical
resignation.
The millionaire needs neither
when he shifts his '"establishment"
from town to country house. Peo
ple of moderate means and ambi
tions to match shut up the three-
Btory dwelling in a cross-street, and
transfer children and maids to a
frame cottage back in the hills, yet
rear enough to town to enable Pater
Familias to "run" in and out sis
days in the week.
Even frame cottages -with a gar
den and stable attachment and
"modern improvements"' inside, cost
too much to be indulged in by
young couples with growing families
and with their fortunes yet to
make.
AN IMPORTANT POINT
The most sensible thing for such
people to do, as the sultry early
heats bring sickening premonitions
of trying days and weeks in store,
is to look up a country boarding
place that is not as yet "a resort."
Such are to be found even in the
neighborhood of great cities â neigh
borhood counting by hours, not
miles. Farmsteads there a-re which
are comparatively free from the
tyranny of fashion, where "grown
uppers" play croquet with their
children upon the lawn, and the
golfer intrudcth not; where the milk
is not watered, where eggs are fresh
and plentiful, and the bell of the
baker's cart is never heard. Old
orchards deep in lush grasses are
there, and groves of virgin oak and
hickory. Within doors cleanliness
and thrift are continual guests, and
prices are within the reach of board
ers "who do not expect city living in
country places.
. That last clause is the pivot upon
\u25a0which turn comfort and mutual
satisfaction, or discontent on the
part of all concerned.
- If you are common-sensible and
know something of this world in
which we live, you will adjust ideas
and expectations to the environment
\u25a0which is to be yours for a month â
maybe three months â to come.
Your rooms will be plainly and
meagrely furnished; the sheets will
be cotton and coarse, your beds non
elastic, the table service will be
homely, and napery, including tow
els, insufficient in quantity and in
ferior in quality to the damask and
huckaback you recollect with long
ings you will not voice if you are
prudent in speech and kindly of
spirit. If the house be clean, the
fare wholesome and abundant, the
surroundings healthful and pleas
ant, engage your rooms and set your
wits to work to mitigate absolute
discomfort and create something
like the homo atmosphere.
THINGS TO PROVIDE
Provide at least a couple of ham
mocks in which, wheu they are
6\mn{j under the trees, you may for
get in the day siesta the deficiencies
of the nightly resting place. What
ever coaxes you into sending many,
many hours a day in the open air
is a benefaction. The hammock 13

character and consistency and does

moreover, that the ropes attaching
it to tho supporting posts or trees
are of real hemp and very strong.
Take no risks in this respect. Many
an incurable spinal affection has had
its origin in the sudden rupture of
hammock cords.
Include among what are aids and

"The little wildcat." Adgate mut
tered, which spurred Jimps on to more

"I never mind nobody, and nobody

A heavy coffee pot struck the green
necktie with brilliant emphasis. Its
owner "dodged angrily, and uttered im
precations against "the brat."
"Thet's the kind of little gell I be."
finished Jimps breathlessly, while Me
lissy drew her skirts away from thÂ«
pool of muddy coffee on the floor.
"She-devil," ejaculated Zenus, ap
proaching his wife, enraged both with
- her and himself for the foolish position
in which he felt' himself placed. "Is
this the high jinks we wants goln* on,
in our house? Let's tek our things and
go. and be well rid of the rubbish."
VShe. tells the truth anyhow, don't

ashamed to be the mother of such a
violent mite.
"An' I don't tell the truf, nuther!
Not hardly ever!'' disclaimed Jimps
with' vehemence afraid to leave open
even this loophole through' which the
enemy might worm in. "Yestiddy in
the dogroom I telled a lie, the drefful
lest one" â how much this confession
cost the child at bay no one could have
guessed. "I telled a lie right clean out
of ray own head aboutâ about a little
squirl that bowed perlite and talked."
She could not keep from her voice the
note of creative tenderness. She glanced
around . with the pride of self-abase
ment, for the boys, once her "spell
bound audience, now must be witness
to her downfall. It was the last drop
of the price she must pay to stay with
Jeremy "forever'n' ever."
"I said he talked to me and called me
'ma'am.' an* 'twas no sech thing at all.
1 lied, didn't I, boys? A drefful black
lie!"
The blazing sprite, with hot tears be
hind the -proud pale look, appealed to
the gray, weather-beaten men, who
were her "boys.".
"You did. Jlmps," came from them
in loyal unison. \u25a0 ,
Little Mrs. Adgate gathered up her
skirts and stepped gingerly across the
cluttered floor. At the outer threshold
she turned, as if to speak, but Jimps'
face did not yield. Zenus hurried her
through with an unceremonious hand
upon her waist. His harsh laughter was
heard as he hitched up.
Then Jimps flung herself on Jeremy's
breast In a passion of weeping.
VT'ne.boys 'ull never. b'Ueve me again.
They'll gag , me vto def." she moaned,
"but you know* why,- Jeremy. You
know why!"
Jeremy could only pat her cheek with
hand that trembled. Ell rubbed the
horny back of his hand across his eyes.
,"I,lied to that woman' deceitfully, but
I telled the solemn truf at the end."
Â« Jimps* tears â¢ flowed afresh, for that
darling lie had been her fondest treas
ure,*'and' now it lay discovered. The

pang. â¢
"I want to see her sleeping," said
Melissy. "May I?"
She had never wanted anything so
much, as at that moment she wanted
little Jessica. Jeremy kept alternately
cursing and blessing himself as he
took her up the steep stairway to his
sleeping-room.
Jimps lay. beneath the gray blanket,
one -dimpled first curled lovingly to
ward the mouth in dreamy reminis
cence of the days when thumb-sucking
was desirable and luxurious. Her black
lashes and furze of corn-colored hair
made somehow a pathetic contrast.
The red lips smiled half humorously.
Jeremy's big hand shook as he held
the candle close to her face.- He dared
not look at the mother.
"Mother and child, mother and
child!" his heart kept saying.
"Has she forgot me?" whispered
Melissy, coming a bit nearer. She was
softened by recollection of the time
when he and she first leaned over the'
rude bed together. For even the shal
lowest woman has her moments of
depth. .
"She don't say much abaout. you â ;
naow," answered Jeremy reluctantly,
>and-turned'hi3 face the other way.
i . Melissy fell on her knees 'anil buried
her face in the warm blanket by the
little head. She was not clever tnuogh
for acting, but she could not have bet

;- "Oh, my baby! my baby!" he heard
her^moan. .

an intruder.' and so he crept down

THE evening sunlight, pink as a"
wiid rose, shot through the open
spaces of the clearing and into
the men's room, where the tired
river drivers, released from the day's
work, lounged about the central stove.
The sunlight fell on the rough floor in
streaks, and lighted Jimps' head till her
hair looked like motes in the sun. It
touched with flame the bowl of Jere
my's pipe. The rest of the room was in
dusk, concealing from Jeremy, ever
fertile raconteur, that his mates had
yielded themselves to after-supper doz
ing. Only his little girl sat, erect and
eager, as if drinking honey from his
lips. The unintelligibility of his tales
to her childish perception only height
ened their charm. Like dim incanta
tions, they had the spell of the mystic,
and she translated them to suit the
mood or the hour.
"To cut a long story short"â he re
peated the euphemistic phrase as those
do who cut short stories long â "she
s-ays, says she, to me, 'Would you have
the goodness to remove that ere pipe
of yourn from your lips?' or words to
that effect.
" 'This be the smoker, madame,' says
I, cam-like and firm, 'and pipes be al
lowed. But would you be so obleeging
as to remove that ere dorg of yourn to
the freight, whar he belongs?' "
"How did the doggie, look, Jeremy?"
cried Jiraps, alive to this feature of the
incantation.
Nothing is .more annoying 'to the
story-teller than irrelevant queries that
swerve the course of the story mid
etream. But the snag was Jimps, so
Jeremy treated it with respect.
"The same war the hombliest critter
you ever laid eyes on. Molasses-colored,
with ears like two pancakes on him.
You'd ha' thought them ears of hisn
would have bothered him considable in
chawin" when he come to chaw."
Jeremy's wit was richly rewarded by
J imps' cascade of laughter. He ram
bled on.
"Her pawin' the smoke away and
sniffln* the foolishest. But I was never
one to stan' out agin a woman, only
tht-t long to uphold my manly dignity;
so I lays my pipe daown on the sill,
accidental -like, the while I mought be
pondcrin' somethin' purty deep."
Jeremy's voice, sinking mysteriously,
aroused. Jimps' nirable imagination.
Her dark eyebrows were raised to a
point above her triangular brown eyes
as she leaned forward out of her high
chair. She looked like a startled in
eect.
"How deep were it, Jeremy? 'Bout as
deep as that woodchuck hole by the big
beech tree?"
"What be you talkin* of, daughtie?
There warn't no woodchuck holes on
thet Adyrondack express. We was
halfway between Big Moose and Beav
er River. I reckon, when quick ez a
wink ihet wumman flipped my pipe out
of the window!"
"Oh! That were smart or the lady,
weren't it?"
Jeremy, instead of gratitude for this
Folitaiy instance of attention in' a
roomful of sleeping dummies, betrayed
the slightest bitterness.
"A durned bit too smart fer me. So
I jist yanked her dorg up by his big
cars ami ho follered the pipe daown
the tracks. I'm blessed if he didn't!"
"The poor little doggie!" burst out
Jimps. in a frenzy of unexpected com
miseration.
She jumped from her chair and ran
to Jeremy vengefully. Her red lips
quivered to a sob, and her eyebrows
were ruffled.
"You hurt the poor doggie, and I
won't love you any more."
"Whatâ what's this?" muttered old
Ell, turning in his barrel chair. "Who's
hurUn' little Jimps?"
Jeremy had at least gained a listener.
Eli, when he heard the next catch
word, recosnized the tale, and groaned
at nis inopportune wakefulness.
"I didn't hurt, the critter none,
dausrhtie. Listen and you'll find out.
At Clear Water I was stoppin' to see
my sister's folks, and purty glad to get
shook off from that jawin' wumman;
but off she gets, too, tv pursu the argy
xnent, when, what In the name of
vonderment did we see a-comin' daown
the railroad tracks?"
The thrill of an approaching climax
aroused the last sleepers, and Jeremy
was tickled by" the stir.
"Thet ere lap-eare<l dorg of hern,
trottin* ez cool ez ye please- â "
"Oh, was he reel cool?" rippled Jimps,
appreciative as always of minor points.
Jeremy swept magnificently on.
And thet gol-darned pipe of mine
in his ugly mouth! Hey, what d'ye say
to that, old man Joe?" \u25a0
"The dear little doggie!", bubbled
Jimps. "And the pipe in his mouf! And
were he smokin* It. Jeremy?"
The satire, unconscious though It
was. did not escape the quick-witted
lurabcrracn. They burst into roars of
laughter at Jeremy's expense. The
simple-hearted old fellow accepted the
laughter as tribute to the success of
his tale.
"I were witness to a most astoundin'
occurrence last winteV," began Mart
waggishly. : . ; â¢ >
"Yes, I reckon we've all sawed
mighty wonders," said Dave dryly, "e r
you give us time to think on 'em up."
Little Jimps, in Jeremy's arms, suf
fered the agony of unworthy obscurity.
Here were all the "boys" with such
marvels at the tips of their tongues,
while she must sit in extinguishment.
There was a silence, during , which
Jimps meditated a hundred fine begin
nings, like one who -trembles on' the
verge of his first impromptu speech.
She slid down from Jeremy's knees and
began In an awe-struck tone: "I've had
a wonder, too! I haven't telled no one
what I sawed on the tote road" this ,
mornin'.'.'
Her tone so dellciously echoed Jere
my's own at his most inspired moment
that the men laughed, but were si
lenced by Jeremy's gentle plea.
"Let the young un tell her story, and
you boys listen and hark. to it." - ; Â«

were the very incarnation of desperate

Jeremy's dazed look was gradually
growing to one of comprehension.
Davy pointed out to Man by panto*
"I bent a nice little gell." she
shrieked, stamping her foot with sav

glanced up with slow Interest, and
mild Garetta turned from her dish
washing.

sawed. I screams when her combs my

"I stamps when he puts mÂ» to bed.

Her intoxicated fancy took widÂ«

"Be a good little gell. Jimps. She is

"Where's the kid's duds? There's no

with- incisive brutality.
Jimps' quick wits rose to the situa

"You got driblets on your whiskers

he emerged. "You look like 'my black
tomcat when he's been in . the milk

In this manner was the entente cor

was discomfited by the applause that
Jimps evoked. Poor Jeremy struggled
hard to correct the opening negotia

i The child ate her oatmeal sloppily,
distracted by the new faces and the as

wardly'fortifying herself.
"Wipe.. off your month, little gell."
said Zehus patronizingly, sousing hl3

"Come, Jessica. I'll show you my

Jimps turned to Jeremy in quick

Thon ihey sailed away again, and before many
; month's Roger and Peter Hughes returned^ home,
4 wiicr and more humble, for Captain Barritt had;
â¢fined them all their wages for deceiving him. Still
they had enjoyed seeing many foreign lands, and
the be3t of it was that now. Roger could discrasa,
things with Uncle Abercrombie with almost as inuch^.
of actual knowledge as he had. â¢ \u0084v . -.
So to Atlantic City he promptly hastened, eager >
to relate his adventures, and when at last all wa3
told and Uncle Abercrombie asked: "Why did you
run away so secretly?" Roger replied:
"Because I thought that you had once been* a
l>irct'j, and I'm not sure yet."
Then he showed his uncle the mysterious paper,
and told all of his suspicions and doubts.
Uncle Abercrombie roared and almost choked,
but at last he pulled out hia old note book and, tak
ing out a piece of paper that exactly matched tho
one found by Roger, and which showed at once that
it was the missing half, he said, when he.: had re
covered his breath: f"ri&*;.>--:f "ri&*;.>- - :
"Jow I'll show you the danger of going "off half
cock, my lad! This paper is part of 'the j Qne"Â«you
found, and now we will place them together*io~that
we can read wh*at is written on them. ?lt is a" little
memorandum made by me on an oldiacrap of paper
that I picked up on the floor â made to'reinmd 'm*
where 'l .planted certain things."
He laid the two pieces of paper together, the
torn, f.Tjrged edges exactly fitting, and with scarlet
checks Roger read this:
"In the east end of the garden
I planted 10. bags of onion 3
and 3of gold en rod seeds,

Roger read; this four time 3, and then cried:
"Oh! Uncle Abercrombie, but I am a fool! I
ought to be kicked half way 'round the block! But
I'll certainly! never be such an idiot again,' I "am'

"" Â»-So, with the assistance of some of the crew, fat
'Captain Barritt would have nothing to do with the
I scheme, preparations were begun for what was to
be : the most- mammoth and colossal Welsh rabbit
ever cooked, and in a few days it wa3 ready. Roger
had never made one, of course, but he well remem
bered Uncle Close's recipe given long ago, and ho
1 conducted everything exactly as the old man had
-''directed. -, ;
. .Hundreds of chafing dishe3 from tjjp ship's cargo
were sending forth a fragrance that made the na
tives dance with frantic eagerness, and when the.
smoking hot food was laid before them, all, from

that was delightful to see. > \. s
Before morning all the fierce, blood-thirsty tribe,
except six feeble old men, eleven women, nine boy 3
and thirty-two babies lay dead or dying under the
waving palms, for Roger had mado a Welsh rabbit
'.that was fatal to savages. Perhaps he put some
* thing in it that didn't belong there. I do not know
ioi what he made it, but it laid the natives out lika

His uncle, whose name was: John McCalhim
Campbell Duncan \u25a0' Ulysses Abercrombic, was a

Main, and h slaver,; also, for in any a queer scar
showed on the old man's nisset' checks.;*, He was

\u25a0 "It's the poor snvagrV who will have the pan j

your r ;inrk suggests ant idea to me. Perhaps I
oari ; induce the King to alter his stj-le of living."
Of; course : the captain -jeered, but Roger went to

"Well, that makes no difference," said Roger. ' ; lt
can easily be split." ~ '"-" '
"Well, if you kin split I'll give you two dollars!"
exclaimed Hiram, "and mighty glad to do it/ tool"
Aftor looking at the big stone, all seamed and
cracked, but weighing twenty tons, at least, Roger
said, very calmly and with a quiet smile: *
"But why don't you. split it?"
"That's^ just what we're scrapping 'bout!" ex
claimed EIL "It will cost a hull lot to blast that
'ere rock, lemme tell you that!"
"I didn't mean to blast it. I said split it," said
Roger.
"Do you think it's made of wood?" retorted J2H,
with â¢ scorn.* "It's the very hardest kind of hard
sandstone, or limestone, or granite, or something
or olher!" . â¢, i â¢ ,
So Uncle Mose promptly moved hia Led. and his
warped house soon settled over toward the cthfr
side, and thus straightened up into something rear
the perpendicular once more. Ho never tiroÂ«l of
tellitijr people about the boy's- remarkable pcrcci?
tion, thus adding to his local reputation, and :non
afterward another incident helped to increase ihc
envy of the other boys and Roger's own c,ouceit.
He was walking along the road one day, and came
upon Hiram Peters and Eli Binger squabbling over
a great stone they had dug out of the hillside and
found too immense to place on their cart) and ra
move. Xli said that unless it was shattered by
dyneinito it never could be takeuaway at all. Hi
rani pointed out that they had contracted to re
move the soil to widen the road, but as the stono
â¢was so large, they must certainly lose money if
they had to buy dynamite, bore holes and blast; the
rock. s;>^*:,.C "',
"Well, 1 done reckon dey don't git a joke on you
berry often, anyhow! You'in a purty smart boy.
I wenter as you a question meself. How do you
reckon 1 kin git dat house o' mine io.stand strai^'it ?
It ler.ns over mighty bad, and 'pears to me it's
a-grnne to just topplo right over some night and
fill mn full of splinters !"
"If you move your bed over, and sleep on the
other <?ide of the house, it will come around all
riglu," replied Rorer. <; Vou ye c aÂ£Kt.i it down on
that side, that's nil."
"Oh, I've been up all night/ replied Roger.
"I've been to see if I could see any Welsh rabbits,
but I never saw one, although Pa says they are
night critters!''
Hose laughed, and then he told Roger what they
were, and how they were made, for Mosc was a
famous cook and prided himself on his Welsh rab
bits and clambakes. Roger was much put out, but
the old man Â«nid:
Uncle Mose Johnson used to tell with awe how
the Loy had, without a moment's reflection, given
him an answer to a puzzling question. Uncle Mose
\u25a0was an old colored man who weighed about three
hundred pounds, and who made his living by carting
asher,. One day he stepped out doors to find Roger
Coverly sitting on a stone and staring at his little
frame cottage.
"Mawnin\ mawniny' said the old man. "Ain't
ye bin up purty early dis mawnin' V*
I fancy many a boy and girl imagines that a
Welsh rabbit is merely a variety of the common
animal which all have seenâ with long ears, short
tail and a silly yet serious expression. But no; it
is vastly different. It is a mess of melted cheese,
blistering hot, poured over a piece of toast, end
even old folks who eat it in the late hours of the
night will confess that they often dream of weird
and awful things when th.ey get to sleep. Once,
after I had eaten two plates of this remarkable
dish, I dreamed that I was chased for miles by a
train of cars like a great serpent, that ran swiftly
along the tops of fences, over barns and churches
and rivers, until, just as it was about to seize me, I
awoke trembling with fright.
Now, very few boys are curious to know what
such tilings are and how they are made, but there
was a boy in our town, named Roger Coverly, who
had a perfect passion for discovering things. When
anything unknown to him was mentioned Roger
began to ask questions, and, strange to say, he al
ways remembered the answers, also. Thus, when
he heard Dan Trout boasting of eating seven plates
of Welsh rabbit at one sitting, Roger was curious to
know what sort of animal it was and how it
was cooked. What he learned remained in his
memory and long afterward was the means of ex
tricating a whole party of tliipwrecked mariners,
travelers and missionaries from an awful fate.
Rop-er took a keen delight in searching for the
causes of things. , He. , .tracked the four-footed
beasts and the birds whenever He went abroad; he
read every story of wood lore and each tale of de
tective's cunning with an eager interest; in fact,
he was ambitious to become a Sherlock Holmes and
be able, by merely glancing at a footprint or the
smudge of a bloody hand on the wall, to say who
had committed the awful crime. People often said,
I must confess right. here at the start, that he wa*
a prying nuisance, at Jimes, butting into matters
that didn't concern him at all in his eagerness io
play ths pert of detective; yet more than once he
showed that in him was the making of a real won
der, if nothing adverse happened. It was certain to
everybody in Riverside that he was possessed of a
fund of general information far superior to that
of any boy in the village, and even the teacher, was
compelled to r.dmit that he was "mighty smart for
his age," which was 13. He was often quoted. in
the neighborhood for his cleverness. Thus he gained
quite a reputation for smartness, which, after all
was but the result of studying things and.remem
bering what he saw.
WELSH RABBITS are not good for little
boys; hence and therefore, they are
never allowed to eat them. Thus very
few boys concern themselves about this Etrangc
delicacy, which is served to the old folks long after
the children have gone to bed and are deep in the
shades of Dreamland.

than the somber, barrack-like structure
in which the British sovereign is housed.
And within its sumptuous apartments
will suffer nothing by comparison with
the favorite rooms of royalty. For state
lineEs there is nothing in the palace that
equals its grand marble staircase, which,
it is interesting to note, is said to have
cost $150,000. It is built throughout on the
same scale of grandeur. It is. Indeed, a
place fit for a King to live in, but. as all
patriotic Americans will maintain, what
Is good . enough for a King is none too
grood for an American citizen when , he
represents Uncle Samâ and pays for/ all
the style, he puts on out of his own
pocket.
Tt is not anticipated that there will be
any knotty points of diplomacy to be set
tied between England and the United
States in the near future. The chief
function of the American . Embassador
will be to cement and strengthen the good
feeling already existing between the two
countries. In that sort of game lavish
hospitality counts" for much. Dorchester
House will give Reid opportunities for its
exercise such as no other . embassy" in
London affords.

Dorchester House contains one of . the
finest collections of pictures in England,
as may be inferred from â¢ the fact -that
they are insured for $25,000,000. Most of
them are by old masters. They include
fine specimens of Titian, Velasquez, Tin

Wouverman. Another of the attractions
of the house Is a superb library contain

"Herr Spamer's playing Is quite out of
the ordinary. His sonorous tone, his ac
complished bowing, the power arid ear
nestness of his Interpretation, his won
derful execution, of the mechanical' diffi
culties, especially in the pure intonation
of octave 3, all unite in Indicating the mas
terful ability of this virtuoso. He played
the Concert Pathetique of Ernst and also
several Wagner paraphrases of Wil
helmj. which showed in brilliant light
Herr Spamer's splendid mastery -of the
Instrument."

The rumors that Gaudenzio Salassa is
to be ue re In -August gain strength. It Is
four years since the famous barytone
was heard here, and he will be enthusi
astically welcomed by a large contingent.
One hopes that the coincident rumors that
Salassa's voice Is In fine form now â as it
was not during his last season hereâ are
true, for his and Gregorettl's are incom
parably the best, barytone voices ever
heard at the Tivoli. Nor have we had
many finer artists than Salassa here. It
Is in concert that the barytone will be
heard.

deplored that he had not mentionel
"Julia" at the lecture.
"Tell me truly," he s,aid suddenly â
"I'm not a bit vain, do you think the
people really enjoyed ... the lecture â
didn't find it a bore?"
My assurances that it was extrava
gantly interesting throughout were
pleasing to Mr. Winter, I think, for

reign. Not only creeds (that* must \ die). J
are attacked, but spiritual faith and hope. |
Heedless luxury rears its head in i all di- ,
rections. A "seditious, .boisterous and
dangerous foreign element is exerting its
pernicious influence in politics." Youth is
trained- not to <-oarn by modest effort
and labor, but to take by craft and the
strong hand. Manners do" not exist.
The cars gather their crowds like cattle
in a pen. Reckless newspapers print
whatever they feel. The "erotic delirium
and sentimental rot" of a Zola arc de
voured unashamed by the young person
even in public places. It is to th<se ,
things that the prevailing coarseness
and triviality of the drama are dueâ AND
to the reign of the theatrical syndicate.".
"The syndicate," said the lecturer, fis
draining the life blood of a great art.
Under its rule acting has become a mat
ter of barter like pork or beans." What
will pay is first considered. Duty. to dra
matic ideals has gone to the wall. "Give
'em what they want," says â¢ the commer
cial manager, not what they should have.
"Illiterate and unscrupulous," Mr. Win
ter designates the six managers that dic
tate the policy of sixty-flye of the best
theaters in the United States. Without
their consent, as in the case of Mrs.
Flske, now here, no actor may play in
these theaters. No.'manager of any but
these theaters can obtain attractions in
the hands of the syndicate. For'the priv
ilege of obtaining plays- and players each
manager of these theaters must renounce
33 1-3 per cent of his profit. / .
That managers had been thus driven
out of the field, browbeaten, broken,
overwhelmed, . the lecturer averred;
that many actors had found themselves
driven out of the- profession; that
critics, for unfavorably reviewing syn
dicate plays, had been ousted from
their positions. He instanced Grover
Cleveland's dictum that of the trusts
that should earliest receive gov
ernmental attention the theatrical
trust came first, as it "most'
nearly assails public morality." He
then instanced the historic fight of Mrs.
Fiske against the institution and her and
Harrison Grey Fiske's management of
the Manhattan Theater as an exhibition
of matchless courage and energy. As
authentic leaders of the drama of to
day he t*ien classed these leading op
ponents of the trust.
The audience swiftly applauded. It
applauded all through here. It ap
plauded Mrs. Fiske sitting there "in
trepid and brilliant." It applauded the
name of David Belasco, now perhaps
debarred from his native town. Above
aIL It applauded the gallant old cru
sader, holding a manuscript that some
times trembled, fighting a great fight
in a voice that sometimes quavered, but
sweeping all before him with his
sledgehammer fact and compelling sin
cerity.
The press next came in for Mr. \Â» In
ter's attention, and in a few keen, pointed
words he outlined the critic's duty to the
drama, to himself and his public.
"A newspaper is not a stage manager,"
he said, "Details of stage management
do not interest the reader, and that is
one of the critic's duties.' Sympathy
should govern the relations between actor
and critic. Nor omniscience : nor om
nipotence should be "assumed. To say the
true rather than the smart, the peppery,
should be the ideal. No critic can make
or mar an actor. Nor is the newspaper
a teacher of actors. 3ut it must-de
mand beauty, purity, truth, ; nobility, \u25a0>
upon the stage, or it fails In its high
est duty and purpose."
That the remedy for the evils existent
lies in the people's own hands the lecturer
agrain Insisted. With all his eloquence he
made a plea for beauty in the drama, for
purity, for nobility... To the managers he
says, "Give the people what they should
have." To . the actor he says, "Give all
the truth and worth of you -to your art.
Live up to your highest*" ideals." To the
critic he says, "Tolerate only â¢ the- best."
To the public he says;-"Demand the
beautiful, the pure, the noble, and you
will get. it."
After some personal recollections of his
actor friends, with shrewd and delicious i
criticsmby the- way;â Mr. Winter'then!
closed the most significant talk upon the '
drama that wo have here heard. " ',
It was after this that I found myself j
privileged to a few moments of Mr. Win
ter to myself. From the: Palace to Mr.
Winter's hotel we drove, Mrs. Fiske, Mr v
Winter, Jefferson Winter and myseif. Mr.
Winter told of meeting a man with whom
he had been at schol in 1842after'the
lecture. . ; \u25a0 . ..
"I was a bad boy," He said quaintly,
"I'm a bad boy now; used to play with
all the quarrelsome beys at school; was'
always Retting whipped," with all an old
man's pride 'n his terrific young days.

George Bernard Shaw himself, with his.

invective so bitins. arraignment so bit

drooping mustache shades a gentle mouth,

blue under the frosty eyebrows, and Mr.
Winter. e!im, frail, yet erect as a reed
detpite his seventy-something years,
looks down upon nothing, I imagine,
teller. than five feet two or three.
Few men of sever.ty-somethine could

couched in English of as startling vigor
ss it was distinguished in refinement and
clarity and beauty. Mr. Winter gave
us. It is by the way, but the exquisite
de-livery of the lecturer, the limpid purity
of his pronunciation, might well serve as
mc-dels to the actor folk of whom he has
cpent fifty-five long years in writing. It
if as^ain by the way, but the dean of
American critics was fittingly and charm
ingly introduced to his audience by Mr.
Peter Robertson, local Cean of the craft,
who is next in the American succession
to Mr. Winter.
Possibly not one among the very rep
resentative audience that greeted Mr.
Winter, save Mrs. Fiske, with her mis
chievous eyes alight, knew what was
coming. Here most of us know the
critic through his "Wanderers,"
through the Quiet charm of "Gray Days
end <Jold," through "The Life and Art
of Edwin Booth." It was not this Win
ter to whom we listened the other day.
It was to a Winter that made one gasp,
thrill and think down deep and deep
again, even while under the spell of his
music.
One may not always agree with the
lecturer. It is the young who will most
vitally agree and disagree. At oneÂ«
sternly conservative and as gay a
young rebel as ever breathed, Mr. Win
ter carries a double standard. Shaw as
a "fourth-rate imitator of W. S. Gil
bert." with an unclean infusion of hlm
eelf. is hardly the light in which that
popular imagre-breaker â¢ just now ap

still cry for Ibsen, though possibly a

"Gay Lord Quex" mood. To Sudermann.
bo far as the "onuoly and unhealthy"
*Magda" goes, it !â¢ tÂ» "be feared we
give whole-hearted admiration. For
these; for D'Annunzio and for his priest
ess Duse; for Maeterlinck, with his
"talkative flies upon a gossiping door"
âor some such; for Sardou (through
Bernhardt, who has devoted her er
ratic genius to the "exposition of the
bestial appetites and passions of the
most loathsome types of womankind");
for Oscar Wilde, Mr. Winter expresses
a scathing and picturesque contempt.
Clyde Fitch, as the maker of "the
tailor-made and corner-grrocery drama,"
was apparently cast ; to the entire
amusement if' not content of the audi
ence.
Less amusement was manifested when
Mr. "Winter turned his attention to the
public. It is the public, in its deadly
laissez-faire, in its base demands,
that is at the bottom of the corruption
of the stage, as it is the inspiration of
that which is noble and beautiful, said
the lecturer. "Pure society, purÂ© stage." j
That the stage is frequently "hospital or^j
madhouse," the shrine of a Duseâ a "con- |
summate type of charnel-house affecta
tion, and deadly photographic miscalled

gwims in actual water and actual â¢ horses I
run to an actual fire almost as fast as
they run in the street," the public has
only itself in the last issue to thank. Ac
complices in first degree are the press
and the syndicate. |
Everything is made the subject of jest, j
the lecturer avowed. "Seriousness is no

NATIONAL ANTHEMâ W. N. 8., City.
"The United States Government has never
designated any air Qr tune as the official

regulations '"The Star Spangled Banner"
is mentioned as an air to be played and
saluted on occasions of ceremony. The
following are the regulations:
Army, Regulations of 1901 (now In force)
â512. At every military post or station
the flag will be hoisted at . the sounding
of the first note of the reveille, or of the
first note of the. march, if a march be
played before the- reveille. The flag -will
be lowered at the sounding iof the last
note of the retreat, and while the flag

In duty that will not permit them. to do
so. The same respect shall be observed
toward the national air of any other
country when- played in , the .presence of

EIGHT-HOUR LAWâ J. O. P., City.
This department does not construe tha
law and give legal opinions: it will giva
the law as it Is in the books. The law
of the United States in regard to the
employment of workingmen eight hours
per day is: "Section 3733 â Eight hours
shall constitute a day's work for all
laborers, workmen and mechanics em
ployed by or \u25a0in behalf of the Govern

MR. JUSTICE BREWER of the United States Supreme Coifrt,
â¢'who was married , not -long ago, has delivered the" bacca
laureate address" at the commencement of a\u25a0-\u25a0;woman's'vcol
lege., He was original in this effort. Instead of complimenting the
young ladies upon .their gifts and graces, he- gave them solemn
warning, to project their "\u25a0, college" training into the study of-. politics;
as it is likely that one of ; them may be called on to assume the
duties of President of the United, States.
j This is turning: the tables. It is customary to regard every
American- bojt as; a "-possible President, and many graduating classes
of young men have been told to so live that Presidential 'lightning
may strike them. -The^wildest hope held Vput to girl graduates ,has
been that they may aspire to. the position of first lady: of the land
by \u25a0marrying / a";; possible President. Now. Justice^ Brewer has put a
buzzer, in the female "bonnet, and-that'little bee will' hum. henceforth.
What- a changed this possibility' implies! When a ladw-takest the
Presidential oath and becomes commander and chief : of > the army
and navy her "husband \ will be the first gentlem an of the ' land only.
He will take; the childrenout walking, boss the servants and* do the
\u25a0general rlollipopping that now falls to the first jlady. . .
' "Justice Brewer seemed "to ./be very convincing, when he eulo
i gized the late' good Queen J Victoria/ as the able ruler of a vast em
pire, -vvvhen las^v matter of/fact : she didv not rule ; anything^). The
Justice should ;know that ;the .British- Empire ds; ruled^by}a ; Parlia-;
mentary committee, ;called: the ;M^inistry.*T
to appoint the'; Prime /Minister.^ and he selects the Cabinet; But even
this; is a -fiction::.; Great "Britain :has^ party government. The -leader
of the ; political ; party avHo wins in the Parliarnentar}' elections is
appointed Prime^ Minister,. and he is thejactua

Mr. B'u'rnham points out that lack of funds, and present im
practicability of executing the plans should not acf as a .disheart
ening deterrent of the comprehensiveness of planning. Cities will
be* much- 'richer twenty-five to fifty years hence. : Besides, money,
ir.ay come from unexpected sources. Men of wealth much more
frequcntlv bequeath parts of their fortunes for public benefits than
was customary in former times. To make definite plans for civic
beautifying gives an invitation and ah opportunity to men ;who want
to 'do" 'something. It enables them to' see 'clearly what they, are
about in their generosity.
. Another thought advanced by the speaker is that :\u25a0' the â¢.putting, of
a city iii beautiful order- is not: merely, a question of pleasing fancy
and sayi:ig-wc will have it thus just because, we like it ; .it\vi!l
tend to better citizenship and to end disturbing conditions. ;. Beauti
ful building and the, putting of things in ordervvill Jtend -to drive
away disorder, disrespect and.. as Burnham fixes it in pur Vniinds,
everything with "a "dis" before.it that causes a black cloud
DANIEL H. BURXHAM. the architect who is working on the
plans for the beautifying of the city of San Francisco, de
livered last week to the Board of Trade of Springfield. Mass.,
an address in which he talked of the esthetic improvement~of cities.
Having made his fame as the planner of, the White City of Chicago
and done good work for various cities, including Washington, Cleve
land and Manila, he is qualified. to speak with as much authority,
upon the subject-as any one in the country..
Burnham's method is to lay bold., comprehensive plans for the
future, and then to patiently and persistently work- toward, their
fulfillment. He says we should plan for the best the. mind can
conceive and bids us stop at nothing short of physical; impossi
bilities. To select for* quotation the following inspiration .by ex
ample of past achievement is to give the keynote of the" address:
"That is the story of Paris. It is over fifty years ago that; Louis
Napoleon approved the plan that Haussmann' laid out. Paris; is
still executing the plan, and she lias twenty-five years v work still
to do. , * * * The plan maintains itself. Therefore I say,\ plan
comprehensively. Don't be afraid to \u25a0 put everything down that
occurs tc you as an clement of beautv/' :-'A-

"For irttance,' one day last summer I
landed in Baltimore. If you didn't: know
it I'd like Ito jrise to remark that Balti \u25a0
more in. summer is not frigid; no, sir. I
got there early in the morning after: a
night ride, croES and dirty. And I had a
lot of customers to see. I made a rush
for my room to take a sponge oath.
There were no towels. \u25a0 There never 1 are
at that particular hotel. 1 rang for the
chambermaid. - She j said she'd have -era
there in a minute. The minute grew to
ten, mighty hot ones at* that.'* I took the
sponge and used the sheet for a towel.
Then I went down town and did ; not're
turn until dark. I went to my. room.
Still no towels. Then I went downstairs
and indulged in a few remarks to the pro
prietor' or. manager, whichever the man.
was.; I didn't stop to; ask his pedigree.
As I: went back to â¢ my room the corridor
was darkâ all the lignts turned low on
account of the heat or the j price of gas,
I' don't know whiu..â and just as I got to
my door I heard 'a rumpus In the room
next to mine. The dodr was open and a
man was' saying: 'In. the name of time,^
you never do' anything right! Why^
didn't you bring :'Â«m'ââ .
."With the memory of my grievance
strong upon me, I paused just outside the
open door, and 'shouted, 'That's -right,'
give it to her strong, and' when you get
through with her send her in to me. By
George! I haven't seen a towel to-day.
This is the worst managed house on my
route.' . : â¢
"Then another hot night Pinkie and I
struck a Pennsylvania mining town ; to
gether. Pinkie is good-hear tea and means
well, but his flow of language is too pro
fuse. We had â¢ had a hard day, nothing
doing, weather too hot to allow any man
to, talk business, and we sat down at our
open window -with a nice cool pitcher.be
tween us and some good cigars. Pinkie
was just ; explaining in picturesque Clan
guage why rio decent: firm would send a
man into such an inferno of heat ; and
coal dust 'when a fife and drum 'corps
began to parade' up and; down, up and
down, before the hotel. 'j.*iey.were prac

something; of "the sort, and 'they couldn't
keep in. tune any better: than in step.
The leader would march 'em back and
forth right past our window, where it
seems the-big mogul was to sit on the,
day i of the tournament. .. ', '.':\u25a0
"You couldn't hear Pinkie's pictur-"

and Pinkie doesn't like to. waste his

crossed to the washstand. " Say, they
''Maybe I didn't feel cheap. â¢ ; At, first I
thought It ;was theiowner of the hotel,
but he came in and .we > had. some ice

was a ! traveling, man taking his bride on

"Well, everything stopped and I went
into my room and slammed the door. In
about five minutes, maybe less, there
came a knock at' the door and I flung it
open, thinking to find a repentant cham

strayed out to the fair grounds. Never
saw such a scrubby bunch of stock at
a county fair In -all my life,' but Pinkie
he just raved about that blooded stock.
Pretty soon he had half the farmers
.with" entries trailing him, about the
pens. sÃy and by he dropped a hint that
he represented a big New York \u25a0\u25a0 de
livery firm that, wanted to. buy strong
blooded horses for its vans. Then every
farmer about the grounds was hard on
'Pinkie's heels. When we went, back to

from each farmerâ given secretly, of

horses at the hotel that afternoon at

through the window. The best part of
the deluge struck the bass drum, but
midway it dropped a few drops- on a
fife player who had side' whiskers a
foot long. I can. see him yet. Very
carefully he deposited the fife on the
hotel steps and then began to wring out
his whiskers, for all the world as I've
seen my mother wring clothes.

which was deep in proportion to the

HUMOROUS SIDE OF LIFE ON THE ROAD
âNEW YORK PRESS S
NICHOLAS lIâ I BELIEVE I'LL APPLY. AMTHIHG'S BETTER THAN THE JOB I'VE GOT HOW!
Amid the ashes and dirt of the untidy
kitchen of a dark, one-story house on
the outskirts of this town lives Henry
Wolcott, one of the last of the distin
guished family of that name, says the
Cheshire (Mass.) correspondent of the
Washington Post. His life is almost .that
of a recluse, but a strange feature of his
existence is that he is unable to distin
guish near-by objects in the daylight,
though after darkness falls he can see
plainly, and on this account he turns
night into day, and Is rarely seen outside
his hut after sunrise.
Because of this affliction Wolcott ha 3
been nicknamed the "human owl" by 'the
people of Cheshire. They are now accus
i tomed to having him prowl about the
I woods and fields when they themselves
are abed. He shuns companionship, is
content to fish all night in the summer
in the near-by ponds for hornpouts and
eels and to spend the days in the dark
ened kitchenr
\ The house is a mere shack, showing
signs of disuse. The buildings are falling
in ruins, every window Is tightly screened
with papers and blankets, and the small
; kitchen where Wolcott sits all day smok
ing his black pipe is dark. He was af
flicted by a strange disease, of the eye
about a dozen years ago, and sun rays
are so painful to' his optic nerves that at
times he is completely blind. At night his
vision Is excellent, and then he goes fish
ling, gathers supplies or chops his wood.
Wolcott is about 57. n0w and an object
of charity, but he wilL receive aid only
.from some of the older families of Che
shire people who were his friends in bis
youth. A newspaper man called on the
recluse one day this week.
I "I'm Hen WolcottJ' said he. "They call
me^ the "night owl, in the village, but
there's no truth in the story that I go
about, at night frightening people. -My
eyes are bad, and I can't see well in the
sun. so when I go Into the village I usual
ly go at night, when I don't have to shade
my eyes to see the way.
."I hear there is a story that I. wept so
much when my wife died that I lost my
day, sight, . but that isn't so. I guess*', it's
a hereditary complaint. Up to the time I
was 40 I had "as good sight as any one. I
don't live here by choice. I have no other
place to live, there's no one to care for
me.' I'm the last of the Wolcotts."
The family history of the Wolcotts in
cludes several famous. men. The founder
of the family was Oliver Wolcott of Con
necticut. When Aaron Burr killed Alex
ander Hamilton in a duel at Weehawken
George Washington invited Oliver Wolcott
to become Secretary of the Treasury.
Some of Oliver : Wolcott' s sons settled in
Vermont, and from this branch the re
cluse .springs. Earlier In life he was a
pension attorney.
The Wolcott homestead Is one of the
finest in the town.. It is now occupied by
a relative of the recluse.
HUMAN OWL.
There are various other details in the plan .which approximate
it to the German license system. The whole plan is, legally and
financially feasible. The City Council can limit the number. of
licensed saloons to seventy-five, and can make the yearly license
52400 and put the local restrictions upon the kind of liquors -sold.
It can ?lso restrict the licenses in their 'first issue to the members
of the combination and there will be no other applicants.
The plan is novel. It introduces entire financial responsibility
into the business. The capitalists who propose. it'"are not connected
with the liquor business. They simply see an opening for ari invest
ment and one that can be made to pay while operated . in accord
with the public interest and with law and order. It is to be hoped
that the experiment will be tried. It will have the effect of taking
the saloon out of politics, and of putting the retail liquor business
in exactly the same position as any other; mercantile pursuit.
< If the license has a proper forfeiture, clause, it Will minimize the
use of adulterated liquors and protect the drinkers who abuse their
appetites, If will lift a shadow off the residence districts and re
duce temptation to its lowest. point. With air of these results in
sight it may well be that what may come to.be known as the Los
Angeles system will be the means of solving the saloon problem
in the United States. Grant that it will' be done by a trust, to what
better use can the trust principle be put?
THE liquor saioon question - is always in focus in American
Where prohibition has been' tried the drinking, place
simply ceases to be an open saloon and becomes a ''blind pig, '.
or liquor is dispensed by the "boot legger/'* who carries his. stock
in his boot legs and pays neither local nor Federal license. -Ihe
stories of the expedients ; adopted to evade prohibitory laws .would
make a book and its chapter- would have the zest of a serious and
a comic side. . . _ , \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 J
Colonel Ingersoll was a believer in freedom of the liquor traffic,
?. 3 he held that'men who .wanted that beverage .would get it anyway,
while the far larger number who do not abuse liquor would not be
hired by its accessibility. He said that if. the Mississippi were a
river of whisky, running between banks of sugar, with mint grow
ing on them, there would be no more drunkards than now. No one
disputes the harm that is done by the abuse of liquor.- Self-control
ih not equal in all men, and those who lack- it will surrender to ex
cesses in the use of stimulants, narcotics, or even food.
Xo legislation can strengthen the- will N or man's power to resist
temptation. That must come from within. In other countries a
system of license and strict supervision seems to produce^ habits
that are fixed in the majority of the people. The German license
system provides a high rate for the privilege of- selling liquors, and
also provides forfeiture forever of the license if impure liquors
are sold, or if sale is made- to a drunkard after warning from, any
member. of his family, or any public officer. /This system of license
is a limitation on the number of drinking places, and it makes, them
all public, because the licensed sellers become detectives- in their
own behalf, and for the sake of their profits, are watchful that no
unlicensed drink is supplied in secret. â¢ ... . _ .
The license also provides for the protection of minors. Per
haps no nation makes mere gpneral use of liquor in. some form than
the Germans and yet no people is freer of drunkenness and excesses.
It is claimed that this is due to long and reasonable indulgence of a
natural appetite, and to the use of the fermented beverages, beer
and wine, in preference to the more alcoholic products of distilla
tion. Whatever "may be the cause, the effect deserves the sturiy
of the promoters of temperance. . ' * ' .
The prohibitionists in California, who deserve admiration be
cause they have the courage of their convictions, are moving in an
active way to use the right of local option in securing absolute and
total prohibition of the sale and use of all forms of alcoholic bever
age. It is held by many that to do this would probably not much re
duce the abuse of liquor, but it would discredit the wine industry
of the State and injure the very large investment of our people in
vineyards and the vintage. Such as these argue, therefore, that
there would-be no gain for sobriety to offset the loss inflicted upon
a leading California product. The first combat between these op
posing ideas has occurred at Los Angeles and the prohibitionists
lacked several thousand votes. But men who are impelled by con
scientious theories do not mind defeat. They try again and so it is
expected that the issue will be renewed in other California cities.
The fight in Los Angeles was by no means fruitless of benefit
in curbing the evil wrought by drinking places. In that city the
opponents of prohibition used high license as their weapon against
it. Their victory is not the end of the matter.' . The license men now
propose a new saloon system entirely. A combination of capitalists
has been formed which proposes to take over, all of the saloons and
saloon property in the city, to reduce the number from 200' to 75,
and to remove saloons entirely from .residence districts. In the
mill and manufacturing districts drinking places are tojbe .rigidly
restricted to the sale of beer and wine only. This saloon trust pro
poses to pay the city as a license the sum of $180,000 per annum,
and also to expend all profits in excess of $200,000 in public.im
provements. ' - - \- : .". .. ;
THE NEW SALOON, i
To the Editor of The Call:
Vy| ANT people in this city work for
â¢IYI their living-. Many people in this
1 v 1v 1 city do not work for their living,
blit they live sumptuously and care not
a -fig for the discomfort or incon
venience of the honest and hard-work
ing, poor. . I refer particularly -.to.; .'the
overcrowdinjr of the ' streetcars 'af^ter
.the working people are through their
day's toil and anxious; to get to their
homes as i'qutcxly as. possible. I believe.
Mr. Editor, that the <rars of this city
should belong for one hour at least In
the twenty-four to the working people.
That hour should be from 5 to 6 o'clock
in the evening. Many of the working
people live a long way out. After work
ing for at least: eight hours a seat In
a car is their right, and it should not be
denied them and usurped by the leis
ure class. Every evening gorgeously
attired women, many of whom during
their' life do not know what it means
to get right down to hard graft and
earn the dollars they foolishly and care
lessly flitter sway, enter the cars! dur
ing the busy hour and occupy the seats
that belong to the laboring class. Can
not some plan be adopted by which the
people of means and leisure* If they In
sist on crowding cars during the busy
hour, may be compelled to hang on to
the straps instead of the working wo
men and the working men? I. like oth
ers, live a long way out. I ride. I can
usually get a seat in the morning; in
the evening sometimes. \ I have noticed
things. We working people know who
is who â we know who work and who
don't work, and the '.'don't "works" are
at least half in the car every evening.
A scheme should be devised to compel
them to do their shopping, etc., at other
hours or stand up. A WORKER.

"You probably wonder, when wÂ« have
become a mere lump of brain without a
body, how we can transport ourselves
from place to place, how we can talk
without a mouth, how the brain will get
nourishment for Itself and how the race
will reproduce Itself. It Is not so difficult
to understand something of how all this
will be done. Evolution and science will
take care of It aIL You know that even
now people often know what another Is
thinking without a word having been ut
tered. Wave thoughts seem to pass
through the air. So by the mere thinking
wave currents of thought will ba sent
out and all other brains may receive
them, even as wireless telegraph Instru
ments receive their wave vibrations. As
for transportation, this will be easy when
we consider that we have now Instru
ments which can detect the heat of. a
candle a mile away. Wo shall have more
delicate machines, which will catch the
power of the wave thoughts and set the
machine In motion, likewise chemically
predigested food will be supplied to thÂ«
brain by the use of a machine run by thÂ«
force of thought. The science oÂ£ chemls-.
try will easily take care of the reproduc
tion of the race of brains."
"Conditions have changed wonderfully
in thl3 short space of 3000 years. Even at
this very moment evolution seems to be
jumping and hastening forward at a paca
unknown to the past. This 13 especially
true with the brain. Dr. John Carty of
Chicago, who has made measurements of
the heads of students for the last dozen
years, says that the head of the average
American student has grown an Inch In
circumference in that space of time. I do
not doubt the truth of the statement.
"When, however, we consider what thÂ«
brain must yet come to and how hard it
is now to learn and to perceive things, wo
know the brain has really just begun to
develop. It is even difficult to remember
what we have once been told. We have- to
be drilled and drilled before we learn a
thing. In fact, the brain is quite stupid
when we consider Its limitations. This
will not be true when the brain U further
advanced. : '\u25a0 <
DR." BURT GREEN WILDER, the
-well-known neurologist of Cornell
University, has a. collection of hu
man brains. In the neighborhood of a
thousand in number, and he is con
stantly adding to it. Not a few promi
nent men. among them Mark Twain,
have willed their brains. to Dr. Wilder.
Naturally the neurologist, with hi 3
large collection now in hand, has an
exceptional opportunity to study the
organ.
\A short time>ago, while in conversa
tion with a group of student friend 3,
he made the most startling prophecy
for. the future of man. "It is no play
ol the imagination," said he, "to say
that some time in. the future the body
of man will not exist â he will be just
brain. We are fast approaching that
state now. The eternal law of nature,
which says that all things that are not
used shall not exist, is at work with
man. Man. is not using his body, but
his brain, therefore the body -must
cease to be. Evolution works slowly
but truly. You know Emerson said we
have coaches and streetcars, but we
have forgotten how to walk., It Is true.
Just to give you an idea how fast our
bodies are becoming dwarfed and weak
ened I might mention the fact that less
than 3000 years ago â an extremely
short .time In the course of evolution
all people were athletes, and a man at
the Olympian games in Greece made a
broad Jump of sixty feet. Something
like twenty-five feet Is the limit now.
In these days an athlete is such a won
der that we pay money to see him per
form little feats that a 5-year-old child
could do in former times.

nucleus a story complex enough to fill

and then having; mused a while upon the
potentialities of. the little gem, sat down
and wrote them out with large elabora
tion, but free of unlifellke padding. -
Such a trinket was this tiny amethyst
box. Sinclair bought it as a sample of
exquisite Jeweler's work. It came from
Venice and might have "adorned " the
bosom of a Borgia," for in it was a vial
containing a drop of the most deadly
poison. Walter, Sinclair's friend, tells
this tale of a night In the first person.
The morrow Is to be Sinclair's wedding
day. Gilbertine's the girlâ good, beauti
ful, niece to a millionaire aunt who is a
gorgon. Walter loves her cousin, Dor-
I othy, who holds. him in doubt as to her
response. The scene is at Mrs. Arm
strong's Newport villa, where the wed
ding is to . take place. Sinclair displays
the jewel to some ladlesâ just to see their
eyes chine with admiration and curiosity.

The "Amethyst Box," by Anna Kath
arine Green, is a fine example of the art
of elaboration upon a single Incident until
the telling of it grows to be quite a
lengthy and intensely interesting story.
It's 150 pages about what happened at a
house party in one nlgnt, but it was a
crowded nightâ deciding the destinies of
five people about whom we are skilfully
compelled to feel curiosity. It is a use
of the grewsome for art's sake, and an
art that uses horror as subservient to an
end that justifies its shudderâ causing pre
sentment to us.

SHORT stories by the cleverest
writers of many lands' are
cnthcred together i;i the first
number of the new magazine.
Talcs, in .t way that makes a
. sort of international compari
son possible, it is more a chance to
observe contrast in styles, however,
than .in opportunity of measuring rela
tive merit?, for so different in kind are
these exhibitions of story-telling tal
ent that the authors can reg-ard any
statement of special preference by
readers more as expressions of indi
vidual taste than as attempts to de
cide positively which are best and
worst and medium. Perhaps if a de
cision had to be given of which one is
best, the prize would gro to the skilled
Frenchman, Anatole France, for his
1 Craiquebille." the story which Is the
foundation for the Parisian one-act
play of that name. That exquisite tale
is something more than just an enter
taining story, it is a sort of veil-lift
ing thing, which suggests to us that
the finer literary artists are. as they
strive ever to better their work, ap
proaching higher toward the compre
hensive view of those "who watch like
God the rolling hours, with, larger,
other eyes than ours, to make allow
ance for us all."
In the collection there is a notable
quartet of stories, each by the most
popular woman writer of the respective
countries. France, Italy, Germany and
Spain, which almost seem to have ar
ranged among themselves to come to
gether here in friendly rivalry for the
prize of a" verdict of best. France Is
represented by "Gyp," which is the
pseud of the Comtesse de Martel. Her
story, cailed "The Fairy," is the longest
in the magazine, and therein gets first
place. It is undeniably clever, and, al
though at the first b!ush it inclines the
reader to think it is going to be too
French, it clears up toward the end
as having had all through an artisti
cally pare intention. The German
writer is the Baroness yon Heyking.
who gix-.es a strong story, called "The
End," but Jt Is such a short sketch the
effort can scarcely be considered as a
thing to measure the author's talent in
comparison with the others. The
Spanish woman, Emilia Pardd Bazan,
little known outside of her own
land, but, holding In Spain the foremost
place among women writers of short
stories, tells a good tale of a strange
duel, called "In the Name of the
Father," In which an old man, almost,
it would seem, by supernatural aid,
avenges a wrens done to an idolized
daughter. If it were really a prize
contest the palm should be given to the
Italian. Mathilde Serao, for the very
satisfying story, "The Peacemaker."
She writes quite as cleverly as the
other women, and in the beauty of her
choice of a theme to write about she
leads them a long way. . â¢
"Gyp," who is a delineator of Franch
fashionable life, is In her element in de
scribing to us the young wife of an old
Count, who is the charming girl called
"The Fairy." The thing Is somewhat
French la the way it handles the love
passion and keeps It so unmitigatedly
prominent, but as the end of the story
shows It Is done by a literary artist with
the effect of making us wise about human
nature and teaching us to beware of. the
subtleties of pseudo-cnarm, a little
French license may be allowed. It is not
at all bad: the Fairy Is a charm
ing girl. who does nothing im
moral, but she was up .to very adroit
tricks in the love game, and she had one
trump card of apparently Innocent con
duct, but used to capture masculine ador
ation by too physical compulsion,
which the Comtesse de Martel Is deli
cately French In the reserve of quite
explaining to us. Â» - â¢ .
Gyp's -work is to give us some clever
character sketches, a picture of French
fashionable life, the entertainment of lis
tening to a talented woman talking about
the frailties of men in being willing vic
tims to the charms of a heartless wife,
and above all an analysis of a woman's
charm whose dangerousness lay In the
fact that though never grossly false she
was never truly true. As her grand
mother said, she has an extaordlnary
faculty of blushing and weeping when
ever she chooses. This accomplishment
and the allied capacities of deception
that go naturally with such a nature en
abled her to play with the hearts of many
men for her own amusement, while for
herself she remritned safely virtuous and
cold. Her grandmother, the Marquise de
Braeleux, loved her dearly and believed
in her faithfully until far into the story
the revelation comes that though her
favorite could Inspire love she- was In
capable of feeling It- When a youth
whom the old Marquise thinks a great
deal of kills himself because of infatua- \u25a0
tion for "the fairy" the old woman hard- !
ens toward the girl. In the last scene of j
the story the grandmother witnesses how (
fate gets in its revenge in a revolting
way upon the beautiful young woman,
but she will not interfere to save her.
With eyes as dry and hard as when she
saw the youth's corpse who had killed
himself she said: "It is justice â at last."
The sample of Mathilde Serao's work;
"The Peacemaker.", shows how^ the re
conciliation of a man and wife who had
been years estranged was brought about
by a eort of poetic justice. They were
angry with each other, but they both !
loved the kindly old man who was the {
wife's father. To spare him pain and J
make him think his daughter was Just as
happy . as she expected to be when she
insisted on hiss permission and blessing on
the marriage the man .and : wife try ." to
conceal the estrangement from him. Tnev
The Spanish woman's story, ."In the
Name of the Father." tells of an old cob
bler, who with "riddled jSkin, clouded
eye and game leg" nevertheless got him
a fine wife, who presented him with a
lovely daughter. "Slargarita was a star,
and her doting father, admiring by
stealth his lovely offspring, was childish
ly proud of the girl." A fencing master
ruined her. He mocked at the old cob
bler's prowess as a duellist. But the old
man went to mass on the morning "of the
fight and in his crazy" grief lie cried out,
"In- the name of "the Father" at the
stroke of his sword, and the thrust went
to the right .place.
. One of the best of the stories by men
writers Is a good translation of Slaxim
Gorky's famous "Makar Chudra," which
was his first big success. It tells of the
love of .the . gypsy, . Loiko, he., .wh.q. could
make many kinds of music, among others
that which causes us to long for some
thing which we feel that if we had It.
then it would not be necessary to live
any longer. The fascination of the story
is that it makes outward nature that
surrounds, men as something so united to
the play of man's Inward life, and that it
tells of a strange abnormal love which
was intense enough to lift . Itself above
the commonplace of Inability to decide
daringly between two great Issues.

China that >Japan will : adhere^ to -that

China has turned from the tfzar to

Chinese' sovereignty over the.; rich

-which withdrew only- when -driven; out

If France,; under ; farther pressure,

.It Is understood that France, reply-
Ing to Germany's demand for an inter
national conference on Morocco, will
consent, with the proviso that no exist
ing agreement to which France is a
party shall be Interftred with. -This
answer, of course,- is . equivalent to a
declaration that the Anglo-French-
Spanish compact must stand. Germany
cannot accept .it without abandoning
her chief contention.
The British Government is by- no
means unwilling to put the genuine
ness of German aggression to the test,
and the opportunity to do so js likely
to arise In the near future. . Tnis was
clearly indicated in Lord Lansdowne's
message to the French Government
yesterday, when he said that Great
Britain was prepared to support both
the letter and the: spirit of the Morocco
agreement. . .
The policy which -Germany is pur
suing: toward France, if directed
against England, could have but one
result. â¢
The government of this country, has
sot the slightest desire to shelter. Itself
behind Its more exposed j . neighbor.
There is reason to believe that - tbe
Marquis of Lantdowar, Secretary of
Foreign A Hairs, vrill soon take meas
ure* to make Great Britain's position
clear end tbe Issue direct.
LONDON,' June 17. â It is probable
that the crisis which Germany is forc
ing upon 'the nations' will soon assume
a new phase. - Every move thus ' far
laafle by the Kaiser has been aimed at
France, although it has ' been chiefly
designed to damage British interests.

One of the chief difficulties that thÂ«
Government engineers will have '* to
contend with Is the wind, which carries
in front of lit and its ' trail ' a . whirl of
sand. On a stormy day the desert sand
drifts into the ditch so rapidly, that
it threatens the usefulness of the canal
if x. not ' cleaned â¢ out every few weeks.
The only remedy that has been^found
for ; this; evil is a. series of fences .to'
;hbld' v back the powdered \u25a0 silica. Three
tunnels are on the line of the ditch in
addition â¢to a tunnel * spillway. These
are lined with cement and were difficult
of construction on account of squeezing

his sword arid battled for Cuban freedom.
For several years, with a mixed and bad
ly equipped band, he maintained a parti

parts of the island,' "requiring the Span
iards to keep "a strong garrison in every
,town of. any importance, and. to -heavily
guard eyei;y .wagon train passing through

The yoke of General Bayer, then Presi
dent of Hayti, was becoming intolerable
to the San Dtimlngans, and young Gomez,
ever, a lover; of justice, and of an. inde
pendent nature, took ; part with the mal
contents and fought in their ranks at the
battle . of Sabana de San Tome. July 5,
1*55. He later became a captain in the
Dominican army, which afterward was
known as the "Reserves" under the-gov
ernment organized on annexation to
Spain. On the conclusion of the war and
the withdrawal of j the latter power from
San Domingo to Cuba- the "reserves",,dis
banded and Gomez, with other Dominican
officers, found; himself on' Cuban soil

No Government to-day can afford to
send out its navy without equipping
it with wireless telegraphy.
Marconi has fulfilled bis promises to
keep passenger? at sea In touch with
land and to publish daily newspapers
in midoe*an. Both thfise branches of
the wireless service are proving Im-
mensely profitable. We are absolutely
Â«ure to-day, as the consequence of the
resultÃ already obtained, that Marconi
will fulfill his greatest promiseâ trans-
Atlantic wireless telegraphy. Enormous
profits must result from the successful
operation of this the most important
branch of the business. These profits
will be divided between those who have
the foresight to recognize in Marconi
securities an opportunity unsurpassed
in the history of commercial enter-
prises. Some of the greatest fortunes
in this country were made by early
investments in Edison Electric Light,
Bell Telephone. Cable and Telegraph
Companies, while thousands of email
investors became Independently weal-
thy, i ...
The profits to an original investor of
$100 in the Bell Company are more
than 5200,000.
The Linotype (automatic typesetting
machine) paid in seven years $127,000
for each original $100. \u25a0
While wireless telegraphy has been
widely exploited in the press, it was,
for a time, practically understood only
by the scientists who made it a study.
However, its theory, its wonderfully
rapid development and its destiny are
to-day better understood and appre-
ciated by the general public. Ten years
ago, if any one had predicted that mes-
sages would be sent to ships In mifl-
ocean. his sanity would have been
questioned. To-day this apparent
miracle has become an important factor
in our everyday business life. It re-
mains the greatest achievement of the
twentieth century. Its success is as-
eured, as it has proved itself a neces-
sity, i
liy means of his latest improvement,
the Magnetic Detector and Transmitter,
a working capacity of upwards of 100
words a minute can be maintained.
"The speed of my new apparatus," says
Marconi, "is 'greatly in excess of the
cabl<\ and the- earning power of each
station will greatly exceed that of a
single ocibJc. The new station at Pisa,
Italy, will be the largest In the world,
and as soon as it is sinished it will be
possible to send messages around the
world. "
"It is to be hoped that before long
Mr. Marconi's system may be made
compulsory on all ocean-going passen-
ger steamships, just at life boats, belts
and other equipment providing for the
safety of passengers and crew are in-
sisted upon by both the British and
American authorities."
NEW YORK, June 17. â Mr. Marconi
arrived in Ungl&nd last Saturday on
tne K. ii. S. ' Campania" and reports
that during her entire trip across the
Atlantic Â»ne was in constant comrauni-
cauoit with both England and the
Uniied States by wireless telegraphy.
iiV will immediately proceed to
Poldhu for the purpose cf completing
thÂ»- installation of his latest hign
jjower apparatus, similar to the one lie
iias jim installed on this coast, so
that tiK- wireless service between Kng-
iand aiid America may now be looked
lor any day.
"The advantages of wireless teleg-
raphy are indeed so great" that it ap-
pears to me almost criminal to send a
passenger ship to eea without flrst
equipping her with the necessary in-
struments.
Mr. F. P. Fish, president of the Bell
Telephone, is reported -to have said at
the banauet of the Magnetic Club in
New York City that all those interested
in telegraphy and telephony must re-
luctantly admit that wireless will soon
supplant them both.
NEW YORK, June 17. â Captain
Pritchard, one of the senior officers of
the Cunard fleet, in a recent interview
said:
That a company operating a trans-
Atlantic cable should flnd it necessary
to employ wireless telegraphy for the
successful operation of its cable sys-
tem is the best tribute that could pos-
sibly be paid to the superiority of wire-
less telegraphy and is strong evidence
that it has already begun to make its
inroads upon the fields of submarine or
overland telegraphy.
NEW YORK. June 17. â A contract
has been entered into between the
Commercial Cable Company and the
Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company
under which the cable repair ship
"Macks y-Bennett" has already been
equipped with Marconi apparatus, so
that the cable vessel can be advised as
to breaks in the cable and thus avoid
the loss of time and expense involved in
putting into port for instructions.

probably be t employed, as it 13 necessary:
that, the exposures shall be ' made simul

there will ; be a . properly adjusted dia
phragm or stop for each lens, so that the

who is l"ue jiuthor of those famous Drury
Lar.e jneJodrainas. "The Great Ruby,"
"Hc-rts arc Trumps" and "Thp Price of
Ptafc" :-lwayÂ« i^s been great on "ac
curacy of detail." and incidentally on ad
vertising, but he lias just eclipsed him
ecif by rel)carÂ»Â»tng a play on a railroad
tratk. A much used track, too. over
v.-hich trains were passing every ten min
utes cr so.
Raleigh's play is called "The Diamond
Ilxprcsrs" and 5s to be given at the Lon
don Coliseum. One of the scenes shows
aÂ» attempt at train wrecking and it is
thts opisode which the playwright got
rHnriJfcfrion to rehearse on the line of the
Southeastern and Chatham Railway.
Perhaps It ought to be mentioned that
the first performance of "The Diamond
Express" wii. be 1 for a worthy charity,
which Is probably one reason why the
Foutbeastern and Chatnam Company
proved so complaisant in the matter.
They not .only placed, the country station
cf Knockholt at Raleigh's disposal, but
gave hfm an empty train to play with.

superb In their violence,'", said .D'Annun
zio. with a modesty becoming one." freed
from all egotism, "and ; I< have, I -think,
written a work which will prove "epoch
making." . * '. i ;>
The dramatist is" now seeking a"'com
poser, to "frame Jils '\u25a0 masterpiece : in mu
sic," and t for. an" Italian theater large
enough to, stage the, play, V which' will. call
for at least 400 supers. --
"HER OWX\Wr XEAR EXD/
lions hold the vessel' for the sacred ink.
Incidentally the dramatist declared, that
the "poetic cure': which; he had under
gone for the last seven years had "freed
him of allegotism." Â»Then he went on.to
describe the unparalleled beauties of his
new poetic play, which is called "The
Ship," and is concerned with the birth of
Venice. ' -"'. . , ' -;,'.'.
It seems that, with the exception of one
which he has ju*Â»t completed, we are to
have no more poetic dramas by ; Slgnor
Gabriel d'Annunzio. Speaking* to a French
correspondent the other day. D'Annunzio
declared that he had . "forced his way
through the trammels of verse to prose,"
and; announced that j his next Work for
the st&ge would be in the latter medium;
As -yet not c a line, of , this "masterpiece,"
as the author described it, has been wriU
ten, but D'Annunzio, has got as far, Â«s thÂ«
purchase of. a'.flftcenth century inkpot of
white porcelain. In 'which two heraldic

wrecking scene and several railway,.of
ficials, went down to Knockholt. when
the rehearsal took place, doing on to
the line the playwright, who proved to
have Informed himself pretty accurately
on the subject, explained to the "vil
lains," the "character" railway porter
and the other members of the company
how the signals and . switchers were
worked, and instructed them in other
"business" while the officials stood by
and made useful suggestions. On the
platform was another official armed. with
a time slip, who gave warning to, the
company when trains were due.
Another, of Raleigh's ideas was to add
io the realism of his scene by means of
blogrtph pictures of. a train approaching
at top speed. It w^s for this purpose
that the special was given him. Inci
dentally Jt had required several hours of
calculation and a full page of typewrit
ten instructions to fit this property; train
into the ordinary traffic. First it thun:
dered along the up-track and ;was .bio
graphed, and then came crashing along
in the other direction with the Intelli
gent engineer and -fireman -waving ..fran
tically from the window, and . thus ; pic
tures were secured which will be effec
tive as' part of a stage scene.

Ar.d we arc likewise rorry if It is the
cas-; that the fine old custom is being
dropped. . In past days two distin
guishing features of American home life,
especially in the South, were the family

"sajing grace" before. meals. There are

The:e was sincerity in the invocation,

"During the past 6everal months," taid
a South Georgia preacher recently, "I

having 'grace before meat,* in the good

â¢''Mr. Henry has made a practice of it
from the time he was elected to serve in
the fifty-fourth Congress. On March 4,
1537, the sergeant-at-arms of the House
paid him $10,000 and the process hasbÂ«n
repeated at two year Intervals ever since.
He likes to have It come that way. It Is a
distinction entirely unique that he enjoys.
"He does not need his- salary for any
purpose of solving the problem of exist
ence; he has made enough in business to
make tha howling of the wolf a matter of \u25a0
entire indifference to him.
"Mr. Henry was born in Massachusetts,
but when a boy removed with hts peo
ple to Connecticut and has resided there,
ever since. He was educated, in the pub
lic schools of Rockville and grew up in
that prosperous manufacturing. city. . ,
"He is a successful business man, is
connected with several financial institu
tions, is a farmer and breeder -of thor
oughbred stock, and a director In the
American Jersey Cattle Club.
"He held various political offices in Con
necticut before he was chosen to serve In
the fifty-fourth Congress. He represents
the- First District of his State in the
House."â Hartford Courant.
When March 4 comes around Congress
man E. Stevens Henry, who represents
the First District of this State;, will draw
his salary for the entire \u25a0 term in a big
chunk. The salary of a Congressman Is
$3000 a year, or JlO.OOO for the two-year
terra for. which he Is elected. It has
been Mr. Henry's custom to wait until
the and of- his term before making any
draft upon his pay, and at the- end of
each, two-year period he â¢ receives' his
JIO.OW in a lump. The Washington Times

almost hour by hour, since Mr. Meyer,
the American Embassador at St. Peters
burg, first sounded the Russian Emperor
that the views of! the belligerents them
selves, as wellas-those; of the other pow
ers,- have considerably modified. Even
the Spectator, which . earnestly desires
peace, said to-day Â» : \u25a0
"It is dpubtful whether the President,
far-sighted as he is, has caught the right
psychological momentâ that is, whether
Russia is sufficiently crushed to accept
the terms which Japan Is bound' for the
sake of her own safety to make severe.
The Czar, of course, has "sent a reply to
Washington, for one does not affront the
President of the United gtates for noth
ing, but the acceptance of his advice
pledges Russia to little, and may, in
deed, bring her great advantage."
A dispatch from St. Petersburg says:
"There Is not now any real reason why
Russia should seek a very early peace."
Irretrievable damage^ in a military pres
tige sense has been "done already. It is
recognized that, in any case. General
L.ine\itch will have a. battle and will suf
fer defeat. After this the Russians could
keep up an Interminable and practically
passive state of war.
"It must be borne In mind that the. Ter
poff 'system, judged by results In crush
ing eerioua anti-dynastlc demonstrations
and keeping the Czar's family alive, has
been asucoess so far.- Until it is broken
the Czar will not believe that; his internal
foes can bend him. Moreover, his en
tourage realize instinctively that if they
stopped the war and maintained a status
quo at home it would be the most sui
cidal calamity of all. - - .t : * .
"Many . Russians . think . that President
Roosevelt's initiative was entirely an er
ror, because they know their Â«wn people,
as well as the Government's , power of
self-deception. If Russia Is not by force
of arms driven to taking absolutely alone
the 6tep ot a defeated combatant asking
for peace oh * y terms, then 'she will
succeed before .c year Is out In convinc

For eighteen years I've been treating Dyspepsia. During that time my prac-
tice has grown "from a email one to the largest of Its kind in the country. The
reason's plain enough â I've always been honest and fair with my patients.
Here In KÂ«w EneU-nd where I've been so long and am known so well â and. all
out through the country, too â people have found that I never deceive them!
My treatment for stomach trouble Is no experiment â It's the result .of years ox
study Ire founded on my own scientific discoveries. The fact that I've cured thou-
sands of sufferers proves It a success. I know Dyspepsia in. all its forms â and
they're many. It's an ailment that affects different people in different ways.
What Trill cure one will not cure another. You're quite right In thinking your
case different from your neighbor's. It is â and no one else can understand Just
what you suffer. More than that â the remedies must be different. Now I ar-
range ray treatment to suit the case In band. \u25a0<Dyspepiia can b# cured only by
Individual treatment. Til study your case carefully for all its little peculiari-
ties. U you are skeptical and unbelieving I especially want j'ou to know my
methods. 'Twill cost you nothing- to learn how hone6t and effective they are.

legitimate student and merchant class
of Chinese and at the same time ex
plain that the repeated frauds by Chi
nese on the Immigration Bureau at San
Francisco have made the people of the
Wost suspicious of Chinese certificates.
I'ndoubtedly the desire of the Pacific
Coast people in the matter of Chinese ex
clusion is misunderstood. Certain legal
bars have been erected in the strenuous
efforts to keep out the objectionable
coolie that leaves no alternative for the
immigration officer when it comes to rul
*ng on the case of the "merchant." Possi
bly, so say those who support the coast
demands, there may be a moderation of
the law us now applied with a view to
giving the freedom of the country to edu
cated Chinese. But at the same time they
adroit that Ihe abuse of- the "Chinese cer
tificate" has been co sreat by the Chinese
people that an amicable adjustment -of
the matter, which will admit of the pla
cating of China by giving her a greater
field for the operation of the unscrupu
lous among her people, for whom she
really has no moral responsibility, is good
ground for combating a proposal to
modify the present stringent laws against
Chinese immigration.
â¢â¢ \u25a0 â¢
The conclusion reached by such men
as Admiral Dewey Is that something
was lacking In the. Russian personnel
and that the battle simply sifts down
to a Question of making superior use
of material at hand. The Russians are
believed to have suffered greatly from
discord among the crews of the ships.
This idea is strongly entertained
among the navy attaches of legations.
JCearly all of these gentlemen profess
to believe that the stability of the bat
tleship as a fighting machine has not
been shaken. They believe that tor
pedo-boats are useful only when ex
ecuting maneuvers under cover of a
fog or during a very dark night In a
narrow channel.
The result of the great battle. It is
definitely known, will not alter any of
the plans now under consideration In
the navy programme except in minor
details.
WASHINGTON. June. 17.â The mys
tery of the battle of the Sea of Japan
1Â§ still unsolved. All manner of
guesses have been made by experts and
by the man behind the gun, but none
has penetrated the steely exterior of
the Japanese bureau of keeping and
maintaining secrets of "how we did It."
The Navy Department officials to a
unit discredit the stories of submarine
mines and look with considerable ap
prehension on the reports that have
come from a. semi-official source that
the Russians sunk their own vessels
to avoid capture.

Mrs. Mansie Is a comely woman of 34
and shows no sign of deranged Intel
lect. She is a native of Boston and has
been married to Mansie seventeen
years.
The woman's clear and 6imple story
convinced the Judge that something
was wrong ar.d he decided that an in
vestigation was needed. Sergeant
Mansle and Dr. Briechemin have been
ordered to appear on Monday, at which
time -M.rs. Mansle, who is still in the
detention ward, will be brought to con
front them.
After signing the canr.nitment paper
the Judge decided to make a personal
investigation. xi:e c.\:i!nr.iation of the
unfortunate woman was held In her
husband's presence. On seeing the lat
ter she began pathetically to recall
their married life a.t the lonely army
post, during which time four children
were born to the coupJe. The \u25a0woman
Epoke calmly ar.d turning to the Judge
said that she had been overworked
and was nervous ar.d run down. She
denied being crazy and demanded a
jury trial to determine her sanity.

Julius Raphael, who is one of the
originators of the scheme, said that the
report that definite plans had already
been decided upon was Incorrect. As a
matter of fact, he said, a plan for an
artistic arcade had been prepared, but
it was only as a suggestion, and it
would remain for the property owners
and interested citizens to decide upon a
proper structure for the avenue.

Gross brutality on the part of members
of Metal Polishers' and Platers* Union
is'o. 12S Is alleged as a complaint filed yes
terday .by the Thomas Day - Company,
dealers In gas and electric fixtures at 725
Mission 'street., to restrain the unjon^frpm
interfering with the conduct of^fcflSttff 's
business and intimidating and attempting
to kill its employes. The most startling
allegation, which is supported by affidavit
of thÂ« victim, is that on June 15 five
members of. the defendant union attacked
and attempted ; to murder \u25a0 George" , A.
Hanks, an apprentice. . â¢ They v knocked
Hanks down. It is alleged. ' and s tried to
beat him to, death,' but he managed to
grasp one of them and hold him between
himself . and the other assailants. Then
the men tried to gouge out J the J eyes of
tTTeir victim, it Is alleged, and in so do-
Ing fearfully lacerated his- face and-oth
wlse maimed him. I Hanks held j on to , his
man, however, until ' a po]lceman J arrived
and placed him under arrest. The names
of the assailants are not known, though
Haiiis says he could identify three ot
those that escaped. >_ . ,

makes j affidavit I that he was abused *by
members of the: defendant .union,; and de
scribes', the methods of S the ; members" by
whTc'n they forced J all of the men of the
works -to walk i out and frightened away
the . apprentices. ,";
;; All of this; came about, 1 says the plain
. tff* company, : through its refusal to ' dis
j charge a number of apprentices. 1 On June
(s.it Is alleged. 'President Caldwell' of the
: union called upon the company and de
j manded ther apprentices be:/ dls-
I charged. "The . union does \ not want \ any
more men in j the ' city.; to : learn : the trade
of metal polishing and plating," Caldwell
said, "and you \u25a0 must,; discharge ' them.
Failing to do so, "we will call out the un-;
ion men employed by you. and drive away
the apprentices." .',:>:\u25a0 \u0084. ,
The demand was refused, it Is said, and
the threat - was forthwith carried into ex

and a : series of assaults : on , the \u25a0 appren
tices so | frightened .them that I they; were

The investigations of the Grand Jury
expert, Douglas Young, have resulted so
far In tho formulation of four reports,
which have been sent by the Grand Jury
to the various heads of j city departments
affected by the investigations. Prompt
replies have been received in almost every
case and immediate 'action is: promised.
One report dealing with a conflict of law
regarding the duties of -Treasurer Mc-
Dougald in his collection of ' the inherit
ance tax for the State will be referred to
the City Attorney for an opinion*. ,
Three other reports affect the theaters
of the city. One deals with the granting
of a license to the De Hague Restaurant
Company for permission to '; conduct a
cafe and . restaurant on the premises for
merly, known jas : i; Terrace 'Garden;? and
now known as "Weber's Music Hall." and
calls attention to the application for per-;
mission to -. establish V a .. theater onj the
same premises recently refused by the
Board of Public Works. .* The, report Im
plies that a theater, is Â« being ' conducted
under a restaurant Â« license, c Four thea
ters, the Alcazar, Central, and
Lyceum, are found '- to ; be running on sec
ond-class j licenses and are; liable to suits
f or ; backi taxes.? -i
In the review of ., the \ Inheritance .tax
Young reports a seeming^conflict between
the law of the State and, that of the char
ter regarding the Treasurer's use of fees
for the collection and remission of-mon
eys received from J the: inheritance tax.
The tax belongs to the State entirely, and
i the law : requires [ the \u25a0 Treasurer >. to make
a settlement twice a: year, ; and provides
a percentage of the ! money collected as a
fee for his work.;-. The charter, however,
stales that salaried, officers; 'shall not; rer
celvo a fee for services i performed. In offi
cial, capacity other than , his salary ias
fixed ; by .;law. â¢ IThe-i charter ) furthermore
provides' that such fees,; if given, shall be
turned ; into ! the, treasury, to be added to
the unapportioned fee : fund. ; , ; , ','â
" Since 1903 - theT Treasurer ?â¢ haa collected

Hughes* husband, and that his home
life wss made so unpleasant by his
wife's bad temper that two weeks ago
he abandoned her and engaged an
apartment in the McCue home. Th-a
object of Mrs. Hughes' visit to that
home was not to ask her spouse to re
turn to her, but falsely to accuse Mrs.
McCue of having: alienated his affec

vine punishment upon that lady's head.
"Humph!" said Mrs. Hughes, when
Mrs. McCue-had concluded her com
plaint. "I'd like to know what right
she has to kick. Her own husband left
her because he could not put up with
her nasty disposition, and then she
stole my old man and has him in her
house. She can keep him if she likes,
but I think I have a right to express
my feelings and let her neighbors know
what she's doing."

Monday, after having spent Sunday In
Alameda and San Francisco ". wiiu their
father, Alva had with him" the Jewels. of
his deceased mother, .which had been

Wie6e, formerly City Electrician, was the
man who shot himself and plunged over
board from the ferry steamer Newark
Wednesday night was furnished to-day by
Jacob P. Wagner Â«r. of this city, who
met Wiese "In the depot" at'the Alameda
mole Wednesday night and went on board
the boat with the electrician. The two
conversed and promenaded the ' lower
deck for five minutes and then separated.
When the Newark docked .s on 'the other
side Wagner waited at â¢ i-e - gang plank
for Wiese to leave the vessel, but failed
to see him. Wagner is employed on the
Belt' Road In San Francisco and was on
his .way across the bay to work, when he
met \ . iese. He knew the electrician well

NIGHT OF SUICIDE
BERKELEY. June 17. â Professor D.
T. Fowler returned to the State Uni
versity to-day from one of the longest
tours of the State ever undertaken by
a member of the faculty. He has lec
tured during HÂ»e p^st six months at
fixiy-sevon farmers' Institutes con
ducted by him in various parts of the
State and during the course of his
travels has covered practically every
cectSon of California.
Accompanying' JiÂ»~Â» on the trip was
his wife, who also is a lecturer em
ployed by the State, her department
being the field of domestic science.
Mrs. Fowler has addressed her lectures
to the wives of farmers and other
women who have attended the Insti
tutes.
Professor Fowler declares that the
Interest in these institutes is increasing
to a notable degree, the attendance In
dicating that the rural population thor
oughly appreciates the provision made
by the State for carrying instruction
to its doors.
The domestic science feature of the
Institutes in particular has proved so
popular and valuable In every way that
Professor Fowler has recommended to
the university authorities the employ
ment of two able women lecturers on
domestic themes, in addition to those
already in the service of the university.
The additions to the staff doubtless will
be procured, according- to Professor
Fowler, and with their coming the
popularity of the institutes is expected
to increase iv a marked degree.
OAKLAND, June 17. â Helpless In the
powerful embrace of a huge brown
bear, Henry Harmon, a well-known
Allendale grocer, had a struggle for
life with the savage brute to-day. His
screams of agony were heard by, Wil
liam Carregethas. a clerk In Harmon's
employ, who went to tlie aid of his
employer, and attacking the. enraged
animal with a heavy club succeeded,
after a combat. In which he was him
self severely Injured, in rescuing Har
mon from a terrible death. The latter,
as he was freed from the grasp of the
bear, with nearly all his clothing torn
from his body by the sharp claws and
teeth of the animal, fainted from the
pain of his Injuries and is now confined
to his bed, with his body covered wua
cuts and bruises inflicted by the bear
in the brief but almost fatal struggle.
Trie anima.l, whose treacherous and
savage Instincts almost cost the life
of Its owner, was given to Harmon
when a cub about-a. year ago and has
been kept by him as a pet ever since.
It had grown so docile in captivity that
the children of the neighborhood were
allowed to play with the animal. Har
mon had gone to feed his pet, when
without the slightest warning the ani
mal attacked him. After the manner
of its kind the bear at once seized Har
mon with its front paws and attacked
him with its teeth, and had It not been
for thÂ«Â» timely arrival of help he would
never have escaped from the brute with
his life.

cuses /himself : on the ground that when
he turned over the'' ticket -in his office to
the lottery 'people he did not know.: '.what
they intended to do with the bit of paper
that ca lied I for a- large payment of j coin
out of the company's .treasury. . -â¢ > .
This condition of .affairs was disclosed
this morning to Prosecuting Attorney A-
P. Leach in the Police" Court â¢ during the
hearing of/ search warrant proceedings
brought by Perry to recover - the tickets
that had been taken by the police. -When
Leach picked up, the bundle of tickets; he
found the mutilated one.' :The "numbers
had been destroyed and across the face of
the ticket was written, "Canceled, D. Ba
bero. May 17." This was the only slip in
the bundle that had been thus handled.
As the bunch had been turned over .to
Leach by the police who had held cus
tody of the tickets, the Prosecuting At
torney at once called a halt to the court
proceedings.
' "Your Honor, these tickets are evidence
in this case," declared Attorney Leach.
"While in the possession of the- police
this piece of evidence has been mutilated.
A ticket that had won a large prize has
been destroyed without the authority of
this court. I purpose to know why that
valuable coupon was destroyed, by whom,
to what end and by what inducement. I
desire a week's time in which to make a
thorough Investigation of this proceed
ing." " . . ; â¢
Leach was granted a continuance until
June 24. The Prosecuting Attorney de
clared that ti.e extraordinary nature of
the case warranted the most thorough
and complete Investigation*.
After Perry's arrest the company's
drawing was held, and the saloon man
discovered that one of the tickets the po
lice had ; seized was a big winner. Before
he had a chance to attempt to recover
this coupon ..agents of the lottery com
pany went, to Chief of â¢ Police Hodgkins
and persuaded him to produce the tickets
taken from Perry. Hodgkins admits he
did not surrender the prize ticket to his
visitors until after he had a long conver
sation with them. v But j surrender it he
did. No sooner ; was < the coupon in' their
hands than ! the agents quickly "tore off
the S numbers- and ;- thus Â« destroyed .^all
chance that the company would ever be
obliged to cash the 57500 coupon. 3 Then
the chief representative wrote across the
mutilated slip and; returned it to Hodg
â¢ kins. : * ' â¢' V -'*'V :~"': ~"' : ; -':-;;' ':.':.',-â .:,\u25a0"-
The Chief of Police explained his con
duct by saying he did not know that the
tickets he had in hand were Perry's. He
says he thought sthey5 they were that
had been taken from : C. : . Isaacs, wMo was
one of his callers that , day., He con
fessed he had made a mistake tln permit
ting the agents, to get their hands on
the ticket, but he did not explain why
he did not take steps to prosecute the
men who committed a statutory offense
by destroying or evidence.
Hodgkins' statement ' fo.iows:
"I think it was on Wednesday, May
17, when a San' Francisco --attorney and
D. Babero and C.'. Isaacs of . Oakland
came to my office and Isaacs introduced
Babero to me as the agent of the com
pany to which the tickets that were
seized belonged. Both men % stated that
one of the tickets, had it been sold, would
have won $7500; that the ticket, not, being
\u25a0old. was a dead: ticket. They. produced
a search warrant receipt for the tickets,
and knowing that Isaacs had been arrest
ed and from their statement- to me : that
he was an agent, \u25a0'. I got Impression
that the ticket was one of the lot seized
from hla place. They guaranteed that
there would be no contest, and after con-,
slderable conversation on that subject I
handed them ' the ticket to" cancel^
"Instead of their canceling ticket
tKey tore off the numbers, which. I did
not think they were going to do. â¢,^ .v _
"Subsequently I learned that the ticket
did not belong to Isaacs, but was _of
a number seized in the saloon of John
Perry Ido not know how, the error oc
curred.' and regret it very much."
OAKLAND, June 17.-A will, dusty and
old, was dragged forth into. the light of
day this morning and perused with even
more interest than when what it con
veyed was all that stood between a widow
and tho outside world, for upon its pro
visions now hang the titles to several
valuable blocfcs of city realty.
The will was that of Harry I. Thorn
ton, a lawyer here in early days. The
document bears the date of 1851 and was
made In Alabama. Thornton died In 1861,
and the paper was number 85 to be filed
with County. Clerk Church, who was the
first incumbent of that office in Alameda
County and whose office at that time was
at San Leandro, the old capital of the
county.
Thornton died leaving a small estate
of several ncres of land near what Is now
the junction of Broadway and Hobart
street, in this city. By his will he con
veyed it to his wife, who without the for
mality of a decree of court sold it off to
people who are now very anxious to have
this little matter righted. According to
searchers jyolngr over the titles the pres
ent owners have no titles until it can be
shown that Mrs. Lucy Thornton had a
right to convey the property.
In order to get a proper decree It Is
necessary to have the estate of Harry
Thornton probated, aiid to this end Mil
lard F. Hudson to-day petitioned for let
ters of administration on an estate forty
four years old. g When this is done he will
petition to have the estate duly set apart
to Mrs. Thornton by virtue of the provi
sions of the will, and her deeds will then
become legal.

\u25a0 The forlorn Giants were making a bid
to pull-' off/. something in every inning,
but they never "made good. Slowness
on the sacks cut off enough runs to win
half a dozen ordinary ball games, while
a good 'base hit that would do some
damageVnever: came through when it
was the. only thing =to save 'the lives
of the Giants.- â¢-. . ' ,
The grief of ithe Giants began in the
first inning, when Mitchell injured him
self sliding into second. Judge Me-
Creedie, consented to guard the first bag
and Corbett was forced to humiliate
himself by going to right field. Mc-
Creedie booted the first ball which
Spencer hit and Wheeler blngled. send
ing Spencer, to third. Hlldebrand laid
down a bunt and Spencer hotfooted
.through. -Wheeler came right on and
reached the pan before McCreedie re
turned the* throw to McLean. â¢
The Giants started ofÂ£. strongly in the
second,. but tiie bliss did not last long.
McCreedie. McLean and Householder all
blngled off the reel, and it looked good.
Runkle then hit into a double play. Mc-
Creedie manag-ed to scamper: 1n, ... and
that was the only run the Giants made.
Â§ The Seals kept on hammering away
and never overlooked any bets. In the
fourth, -fifth and sixth, they sent men
over without a sreat deal of difficulty.
Cates mt hard at times. Gochnauer
was I there with three singles, the/first
two of them bringing men home.

The Russian ship Fennia, 147 days from
Antwerp,, arrived yesterday after an un
eventful voyage. Russian merchantmen
are rarely seen in this harbor since the
old barkentine â¢ . Behring was lost, . . The
Fennia was here about a year,: ago, and
since then, except on the cruiser LÂ«na,
the Russian flag has not been', among
those fluttering, in the afternoon â¢ breeze.
Captain Hallman shrugged his shoulders
and looked bewildered when told "of .the
destruction of the Czar's navy; but made
no comment. .He reports that-on April 3,
when 200 miles off the ru.^land Islands,
Otto Innonen,- a .seaman,, fell ".' overboard
Trom the . crcssjack yard and .was
drowned. Otto was 20 years old and a
native of Finland.. .
Henry Hahn, a teamster, who lives at
1511 Ellis street, where, he says, "we're
just as tough as you'll find at Third and
Brannan," came to Â«rrief yesterday in the
effort to collect $15 from a . water front
street sweeper. HÂ« cornered the sweeper
behind the bar of a water front saloon,
and with a friend inaugurated a siege,
which was not to have been raised until
the $15 was forthcoming. The bartender
was a Swiss and not in favor of war, so
he telephoned for an arbitration commit
tee from. the, Harbor police station. "When
Policeman Castor entered the place'Hahh
seized the man in blue and threatened to
roll him in the sawdust if he did not beat
a quick retreat. "And then," said Castor
at the Harbor Hospital, "I gave. him the
foot, and when we hit the floor I rapped
him with my stick." Surgeon F.J.Till
man did some plain stitching on Hahn's
scalp, and as the teamster's skull did not
seem to be fractured Policeman Castor
escorted his prisoner, to the Harbor sta
tion. The $15 still figures in Hahn's assets
among the '.'bills .'receivable."

take her out of school because she could not
hear her teacher. Both ears discharged a foul
stcellisg matter that was most distressing.
The ' child had been given medical treatmÂ«nt
without a&y benefit. Her general health waa
affected by ber trouble acd she could cot eat.
\u25a0nd her afSlctloa ! made her very miserable.
Â£he did net car* to pUy with other children
and was in ervas danser of becoming stone
deaf. In two mootls" time Rosa, was per-
fectly cured at a very small expense. Tne*
catarrh waa cured. ,t>e dlscbarse from the
ears was prcmptly cured, her appetite re-
turned and her general health grew "better from
the Btart of the Klectro-Cbcxalc treatment.

It is certain that a squabble occurred
over something among the American
women.
that she could take'no part in the affair.
The Countess of Yarmouth, formerly Miss.
Alice Thaw of Pittsburg, was the only
American among 1 the stall holders who
etuck it out. She wore a costume of the
perioa.of Charies.l. and. very pretty /she.
looked In It. and made a very successful
saleswoman. .. "/,
The Duchess of Marlborbugh was an
other who made the sudden discovery
On such occasions American women are
not usually found occupying backs eats.*
As a matter of fact, conspicuous posi
tions had been assigned, to several oÂ£
them. Mrs. Edgar Speyer -was to - have
had charge of the candy booth, ; but ' at
i he eleventh hour she dropped out, plead
ing illness as an excuse, and as. there
was no time to make other arrangements
the booth Itself was omitted.
IX)NDON, June 17.â Much curiosity has
been aroused In fashionable circles as to
the reason why all the prominent Ameri
can women save one withdrew from ac
tive participation in the Westminster
Hospital bazaar, held in Dean's Yard,
Westminster. It was the greatest char
ity fair of the year and under the patron
ajre of the Queen and a lot of lesser roy
alties.- 'Â£h**i>

. In Europe" something like a boom in
Rousseau seems on the way. At Mont
morehcy'a" statue' to the philosopher's
memory. is abdut r to ; be erected.*! Eight
een more", of ' Rousseau's ; letters : are
about 7to be published." ' Finally . the
membership' of 'the'; Genevan 'Rousseau
Society, has just received an important
addition in , the = person of Count Leo
Tolstoy. In his letter accepting "mem
bership. In' the' society,; Tolstoy y says,
"Rousseau has been my master since I
was 15. His works and the:Holy;Gos
pel - have been' the two great' and 'benefi
cent Influences 'that: have affected my
life. Rousseau .-, 'does ;:not grow old.

and felt the same elevation of the' soul:
and the same/ admiration that I /ex
perienced when', reading him in the
days of my youth.V ,/ /' t ; \u25a0' -, . ' .. .
_ The new Rousseau letters, which are
about to ; be . published; all ' have to do
with:- the ' susceptible philosopher's re-
gard'for. Madame d'Houdetot end have
been \. preservediby *:aV member of / that'
lady's . family. . In â¢ one, of them, sixteen
or twenty pages' long,; Rou6sÂ«au gives
his views on the; nature Vof friendship; 1
and in another discusses his feelings
in regard to/death; which he/ tlien r be
lieved; to>be near. There Is no, doubt
that | the r documents ; were //written ". In

It is i probable that Napoleon, upon
his arrival, would have left the tMar
ciana unmolested if he had not coveted
Its home for 'an "addition to*, the royal
palace. â¢ Accordingly/ the \ 60,000 > books
and manuscripts which the library then
numbered were hustled out of the pal
ace built' by Sansovino : and for want of
a better place transferred- to that of
the - Doges. After -that' the collection
increased rapidly, and long > before ,It
reached Its present, size '.began to im
peril the stability of the ( venerable
structure to "which i it had -been', trans
ferred. Stowed , away ; in various {parts

GREAT HELP TO STUDENTS.
Some time 'before his death in 13741
Petrarch determined .to bedueath. his
books to Venice 'â¢andthereby^foutidv a
grrjeat. and famous^. .library, 'like > those
of olden times." -The /poet's wishes,
however, were not. respected fully, his
books being dispersed and only aya v few
coining- to the city oh" the Adriatic. To
these, however, was added In 1468 -the
great collection presented" to Y thÂ« , re
public by Cardinal Bessarlon. The li
brary of this learned ecclesiastic nurn-'
bered more than a thousand Greek arid
Latin codexes; and had been grot to
gether at a cost of 30.000^ffolden^u:
cats, or $600,000. Thus augmented' the
Venetian Government- at* once decided
that the Marciana library should, have
a worthy home and commissioned Ja
copo Sansovlno to" build a* small pal
ace for , its reception.'. This' was . fin
ished in* 1553. and afterward'ornament
ed with paintings by Veronese- and
Tintoretto and with stucco work by
Vittorla. There the library was in
stalled and â¢it Increased ] hardly at all
until the eighteenth century,' when leg
acies from the houses of Contarini and
Recanati added greatly to its volume.
'LONDON.^ June _17.â After., a delay 'of
many years one of the most .famous
libraries in the world "has been .re
moved from a situation where it was
practically useless and a , source "of per
petual \u25a0 danger to one where students
will be able to utilize it to the best ad
vantage. The library ; in. duestion is
the historic Marciana collection at Ven
ice, which "was founded by. Petrarch
and which. since the time of Napoleon
I has been housed An the : Dogre's Pal
ace. The new repository of the library,
which ; consists of more 'â¢ than 200.000
volumes, is 'tlie'Falazzo della Zecca,* or

The- Supreme Court decided that the
Superior Court erred in fining ex-Police
Commissioner Hutton $100 for. contempt
in arresting Mary Duran, an ' inmate" of
the brothel at 1129 Dupont- street. The
penalty is and a precedent" is
established 'for future action..
Jean Pon opened ; a restaurant at the
entrance *of-. the disorderly, house, at
1129 Dupont street, s According to the
arguments presented by George D. Col
lins,": Pon's -attorney,, none" of the .fallen
women /who : make their ' headquarters
at .the. brothel could be arrested .if, it
were shown ' that.' they were patrons of
ithe pseudo" restaurant.' District-Attor
ney.-Byington/ in -his presentation of

maintained -that: Pon's "place was es
tablished : merely to evade the law.
' Judge. Cook Issued an 1 injunction for
bidding any. member of the Police De

of the ibagnio. 'Hutton, who was then
a member :of the Police Commission,
succeeded in having himself appointed
"Special Chief of; Police" for, 1129 Du

company .'with -Patrolmen :G." F.- Barry

of Uhe' fallen women -to attempt to're

RESPECTABLE
ELEMENT WINS
The. Supreme Court decided yester
ilay thaT Charles A. Smith, cashier of
tho Southern Pacific Company, need not
pay- his -.wife ..more than $100 .a- month
for; her support.' She claimed that .she
was entitled to S2OO a month, but the
Justices disagree with her.
Smith lias for many years held a po
sition with the railroad which pays
him $375 a month. Early in 1599 each
decided that the other was "cruel and
inhuman." After .various court en
gagements, ranging from skirmishes to
battles, he won his case. The suit was
of particular interest from the fact
that the wife acted as her. own -attor
new and raked over all the unwashed
family linen in the sweet feminine way.
Then she procured the services of a
competent attorney and the struggle
\u25a0was renewed. Smith was directed to
pay her $100 a month for maintenance."
He appealed to the Supreme Courfand
the order was sustained. Meanwhile
Fhe had reopened the divorce case, and
asked for $100 alimony, which'^was
given her. The railroad man "was
aghast at the idea bf paying out $200
a month alimony for the lady with
\u25a0whom he was fighting in the courts.
He Again appealed to rhe' Supreme
Court for relief from his predicament. 1
A few months ago the Justices â¢ de
clared that he must pay the $100 a

"WASHINGTON, June 27. âR. .'P.
Schwerin of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company has asked Secretary Taft to
make an important restriction of mer
chandise shipped to Colon for : delivery
via the Panama Railroad at Panama,
thence to be transshipped to Central
America, Mexico and the Pacific coast
of the United States. l' : -:i'P.
i " Schwerin desires that such merchaa
dise be handled on the Panama Railway
only on condition that it is trans
shipped In x American bottoms to the
points named. He makes his plea 7 on
the ground \u25a0. that , American steamships
cannot compete with foreign ships, in
this trade because of the high cost*. of
American labor. and supplies. American
steamships -being now without any
governmental assistance or subsidy"to
equalize the disadvantage. He " stated'
that it cost $25,000 more to operate an
American . than ' a foreign steamship â¢of
large. size. . . - *"
\u25a0 Schwertn's request does not apply, to
merchandise to be shipped - from Pan
ama to South America. It refers only
to shipments northward , from that
point. 'j^ffiJSJKJSS
.The request has not yet been grant
ed. It is considered a most, vital ques
tion by^Taft.', who .will take it up , with
the President. ..The monopoly which
the Pacific Mall Steamship Company, at
present r: enjoys ;as to : shipments from
the ? Panama, Railroad to . Pacific ; ports
will ;be broken up on July, IS by the
abrogation -of -Its contract with taÂ»

It is further claimed/ that : Dr. Baird
has at all times sSnce; he became a mem
ber of the State board been gruff. and dis
courteous ito applicants : askins: for ; - Jn?"
formation and access to the boards',rec
ords." It. i& alleged c that; Dr. Baird, . in-?
stead of prosecuting illegal ..practitioners,
of whom there are hundreds ;in 'â¢\u25a0 the State!.
has devoted C h!s : time, . for p which E.- he
eharsed the State * ?10 " a * day, ia ; brlngins
\u2666There J ; have been no , more illegal
practitioners , prosecuted < under; the â¢ ad
ministration of the â¢" present dental
board than under any, previous - board,
yet the. expense* have been ninStiplled
tÂ»yelv* fold."
Clf ARGED WITH DISCOURTESY.
board. lie has granted more temporary
license* than, all of' the members of the
board ten times oi er, merely, ire be
'liev* we can fehow, to sain the pecuni
ary benefit. On days when business Is
doll he takes jaunt* Into the country to
look tor Illegal practitioners. For this
be charjret the board ?10 a day. He
ha* tone to tbe various dental depots
about town and asked the : clerks to
â¢end any one askins for a member of
. the State Board of Dental Examiners to
him, that he mlzht grt the $5 fee al
lotted to the man Riving; an examination
tor temporary license. Further than
this* he flasxautiy violated the State
dental law by putting In a bill for $50 a
month for acting as secretary; when he
held that office. The law plainly states
t not . the position of dental examiner is
an honorary one, and. that the members
of tbe dental board shall receive : no
compensation for th err services, \u25a0; other
than ' $10 \u25a0\u25a0 a ; day.Â» for ;. the time, actually
epent In r* vine examinations , to ' appli
cants ' tor 'permanetn _.; licenses, i ; Dr.
Balrd employed his wife ' to: assist him
as secretary* and charged tbe board $20
for her - services.^ He also employed \u25a0 a
man to . look . up Illegal .; practitioners,
payinff him $40 a month.. All:tbis ex
pcn*e Mas In open violation "of the law.
Tee better' element of the board songbt
to throw out these bills, hot Balrd,' by
â¢ome peculiar Influence, held sway, over
ttie majority. , . /
Among the many things alleged , against
Dr. Baird is that he has promiscuously
grajited temporary licenses, for which he"*
received a $5 fee each. In support of this
charge the affidavits of two dentists, one
In this city and one in Chico, are in the
possession of Drs. Cool and Dunn. These
affiants allege that they secured their li
censes by the mere payment of the $5
fee to Dr. Baird, no questions being asked
and no written examination given.
Dr. Baird also will be charged with
having grossly misused the office of sec
retary of the board, which he held. for
two years, and the office of president,
\u25a0which he now holds. It is charged that
Dr. Balrd has misused the funds of the
iEtate board and spent more of the board's j
money than any preceding officer. Last
year when acting as secretary of - the
board Balrd drew from the funds of the
board and secured from the wholesale
granting of temporary licenses more than
Ji2oo, over JlOOO more than ever before
collected by any previous secretary of
the board. Previous boards *rarely had
an expense of more than $35 or $50 for tbe
â¢ecretary*s office. These facts are a mat
ter of public record. The dentists bring
ing the charges against Baird claim that
they will chow that the moneys drawn
from the treasury of the board by Dr.
Balrd "were not actual expenses, but
taken Illegally from the board's funds.
Speaking last night of the alleged irregu
larities of Balrd, Drs. Cool and Dunn
said:
"Dr. Balrd Is no fit nun to represent
the dentists of California on the, State
POCKETS THE FEES.
The board yesterday finished its regu
lar examinations in this city of appli
cants for license. Drs. Dunn and Cool
hid proposed to launch their charges
against the accused members at the af
ternoon session, but the Baird followers
Eraelled a rat and an ttdjournment to Los
Angeles was voted as 'soon as the meet
ing was called to order, so that the scan
dal was temporarily averted.
While the Â«ait for the restitution of
funds aliened to - have been illegally
appropriated v.-11l be primarily directed
as^ilstt Dr. Baird, it is said that Drs.
Arthnr B. Maybew of Palo Alto; C. A.

In the wheat districts the conditions have
been ideal, and both winter and spring wheat
have made wonderful progress. Winter wheat
in headed out ready to bloom and spring sown
wheat is in some instances nearly as far ad
vanced. It ie generally "in the boot." but
come is beginning to head out- The prospect
tor an exceptionally heavy crop was never
better at this stage of the eeason.
Another splendid growing week has just end.
cd. perhaps better than any that has preceded
it. Copious showers in the fore part of the
week were followed by several days of warm
sunshine, which has caused all vegetation to
make rapid progress. More rain has already
fallen since the first of June than usually
falls during the entire month.
\u25a0Pastures and meadows are In the best pos
sible condition. Clover is nearly ready to cut
and a small amount of cutting has been done.
Oate are growing finely, but in fome localities
of the White River Valley they are t--aid to be
weedy. Hops are making fair growth, but
have rot armed out yet. Barley In being cut
in the Klikitat country and is a good crop.
Potatoes are thrifty and all vegetables are
making satisfactory progress. The week has
been mere favorable for strawberries than the
preceding one. Cherries are beginning to ripen;
thÂ» crop will not be large. ;
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section di
rector/ United Slate* Weather Bureau, for the

The market opened steady and unchanged to

Wall-street bulls gave sUpport.at the opening.
Mr Neill of New Orleans was out with a re
port estimating the crop : at 11,100.000 bales .
This had a great deal of influence on the mar
ket, which is in a very nervous. condition, 1 with,
trade at sea, as to i^at ! course to | pursue, the
flhon Interest being pretty well run in and a
Ion? one no doubt accumulated.'
Â»vr-YorlÂ£ Cotton Market.
STOCKSâ The market ruled dull without any
special ; feature. Very little stress was laid
on the fact that both Germany and France are
reported to be mobilizing their troops and war
ships. The general feeling se*>ms to be that
the coming week will clear up many of the
dark clouds that overhang ihe financial sky.
The activity of the bears meets with only little
response which leacs to the impression that
the market is badly oversold. A little -aggres
sive buying of a favorable turn in events could
racily bring about a sharp rilly. The closing
was ceneraJly lower.
COTTONâ The market ruled fteady through
out the session, buying by commission houses
and support by the big bull operators being the
factor*. The sharp advance in the last few
â¢iays seemed to have weskened the technical
and speculative position, for. with the retire
ment of the former bear leader, shorts gener
ally in all the markets have been active in
covering and outsiders have been coming in
rapidly It looks now as though the specula
tive ehort interest ha* been reduced and that
rbere is danger of the market gftting into an
overbought condition, and therefore we are ex
rectlng to ccc sharp reactionary movements
from time to time, with opportunities for op
erators liquidating on the bulges to get in
again at a lower price. The tendency of the
market is likely to continue to work to a
higher level throughout the month.

V Such a beating \u25a0_ as Clancy took s about

about several times; but , that was r all."

NEW YORK, June : 17.â James R.
Keene's Sysonby, with Nlcol in the sad
dle, won the Tidal Stakes jof $20,000 over
one mile and a quarter to-day at Sheeps-.
head Bay. Sysonby, which made his first
handicap ~ appearance on May. 4, : was in
the best possible condition, having, worked
a mile and a quarter In 2:07. 1 The books
made him a ; hot favorite at 9 to 10. r He
ran the distance to-day in 2:05,. which is
a new record for the stakes, v; ;^
Captain S. S.. Brown's Agile, paying
even money for .the place, ran second,
while Sydney Paget's Cairngorm, the sec
ond choice, was third. The Tidal Stakes
is one of the features of the Coney Island
Jockey Club's programme. It was^flrst
run in ISSO, and has been won by some
of the greatest horses America has ever
seen. The gross value of the stakes is
$20,000, of which $15,000 goes, to the winner,
$2500 to the second horse, 'and $1500 to the
third. - - - \u25a0>;' ' :. : ;;.7^v.-\-; â¢.â¢\u25a0;-;\u25a0\u25a0;â¢ \ : V,- ;
Out of the original six entries two were
scratched. : Sydney j Page t withdrew. Tra
dition, depending: - upon : Cairngorm 3to
carry his colors to victory, and J. ' E.
Madden declined the issue with Hot Shot.
Mr., Keene was naturally, elated after
the race. "Beldame Is queen of the
turf," said he, - "but there ; is no doubt
after this performance that Sysonby; is
king. Moreover he j has not been himself
until lately. , It is ; ; not< for the; value of
the stakes I am pleased, but because the
colt seems likely to take His rightful place
as the best of his age. At, last I, have a
grand horse. He could; have run In 2:04
or better if necessary.'.' Summary:

In a good race sailed on an ebb tide
in a stiff westerly breeze with a mod
erate sea, the centerboard sloop Corin
tiiian won a decisive victory yesterday
over the tin-keel sloop Challenger. She
won by a margin of 8 minutes 16 sec
onds, corrected time, and retained the
San Francisco Perpetual Challenge cup
for the Corintixian Yacht Club.
The race was sailed ox r er the Corin
thian Club course, the reach to the lee
ward stakeboat being lengthened from
one and an eighth miles to three miles.
The Corinthian outsailed her rival on
every leg except the first beat to the
Presidio Shoal buoy, on which the Chal
lenger gained 23 seconds. On the run
to Goat Island buoy the Corinthian
gained 2 minutes (7 seconds. On the
reach to the northerly stakeboat, off
Angel Island, she gained 1 minute 6
seconds. On the second beat out to Pre
sidio Shoal buoy she gained 3 minutes
SS seconds, and on the run home to, the
finishing- line she gained 1 1 minute SS
seconds. The total gain of the Corin
thian was 9 minutes 16 seconds, from
which was deducted the Challenger's
gain of 23 seconds on the first beat, plus
Â£7 seconds time allowance, making a
total of 1 minute, and a net gain of 8
minutes 16 seconds for the Corinthian.
The rival yachts, with their hulls
black-leaded till they shone like newly
polished stoves, were on the scene in
good time and cruised about waiting
for the preparatory signal. It had been
arranged that this should be given at
1:25 p. m., and the starting signal at
1:30 p. m., but the non-arrival of the
steamer H. J. Corcoran, which had been
chartered to convey spectators round
the course, caused the start to be de
ferred till 2:15 p. m.
Commodore W. G. Morrow, who sailed
the Challenger, evidently intended to
cross the starting line first, and would
have done so had not a tug with a long
tow compelled him to go about just as
he was beating 1 up to the line. In con
sequence of this Frank Stone, who
sailed the Corinthian, put her across
the line 1 minute 5 seconds ahead of the
Challenger, and, as the San Francisco
boat gained only 23 seconds on this leg.
the Corinthian rounded the mark first
and was never caught by her opponent.
On the other four legs the Corinthian
gained steadily. On the last beat out
the jib sheet of the Challenger carried
away and the sail was down for three
minutes, but even counting all this as
less the beating was a decisive one.
So far as the critics on the steamer
could see Mjth skippers sailed a race free
from error, but Frank Stone displayed
good judgment in ha\-ing his mainsail
:T-ff<-d. whereas the Challenger's full
eprefta of canvas proved a little too much
for her at times. The race was under the
management of T. J. Kavanagh. Stewart
Middlrmtis und Alexander J. Young, rep-
Tlie Corinthian crossed the starting line
at 2:16.-05 p. m.. and the Challenger at
2:17:10: the Corinthian rounded Presidio
Shoal buoy at 2:41:36, and the Challenger
at 2:42:18; the Corinthian rounded Goat
Island Shoal buoy at 3:07:36. and the
Challenger' at 8:11:15;- the , Corinthian
rounded the leeward stakeboat at, 3:13:05.
and the Challenger at 3:23:50; the Corin
thian rounded Presidio Shoal buoy for
the second time at 4:04:12/ and the Chal
lenger at 4:12:32; the Corinthian crossed
the finishing line at 4:20:58, and the Chal
lenger at 4:30:56. The times of the yachts
for each leg of the -course are shown in
the table: â¢ â¢ : . . , ', -' \u25a0 ' â¢ '
resenting the Corinthian Yacht Club, and
Roy C. Ward. Henry G. Toll and L. P.
Rixford, representing the San Francisco
Yacht Club. The racing length of the
Corinthian, which carried 1073 square feet
of sail, being 29.36. and that of the Chal
lenger, which had a sail area of 067 square
feet, being 28.99, Challenger received,
thirty-seven seconds time allowance.
The Challenger was sailed by her own
er, W. G. Morrow, commodore of the San
Francisco Yacht Club,. and the Corinthian
by Frank Stone. The referee was H. E.
Chapman, commodore of the Vallejo
Yachting. Club, the Judges being Roy C.
Ward and T; J. Kavanagh and the timers
Stewart Middlemas and L. P. Rixford.
The course was across the starting line
off Powell street wharf to and around
Presidio Shoal buoy; thence to and
around Goat Island Shoal buoy; thence
three miles due north to and around the
leeward stakeboat anchored off Angel
Island; thence to and -around Presidio
Shoal buoy for the second time, keeping
Alcatraz . Island on the starboard hand;
thence to the starting line off Powell
street wharf, all marks being left on the
port hand.
The crew of the Challenger consisted of
R. S. Bridgman, W. W. Farrar. W. Fol
lansbee. W. I*. Spencer, A. E. W ray and
Harry Helen.
The crew of the Corinthian was made
up of T. Jennings, J. C. Brickell, J. Short,
Douglas Erskine, F. E. Schober and
Neill McLean.

The Leading Specialist.
* DR. O. C. JOSLEN',
Quick and
Certain Cures
for Men.
ilj" uneqaaied success has fully es-
tabtlsbed tny reputation as the lead-
ing- specialist In men's diseases. I not
only treat with certainty of effecting
a cure, bat all my cures are accom-
plished In the least posslbl* time.
Prompt and thorough results mark all
really scientific methods of treatment,
and are just as Important as they are
desirable, because any slow form of
treatment endanrers ths case to chronic,
complications. To trust to the dd-
facbloned methods Is to take serious
chances.
"WEAKNESS"
Doeiag the system with powerful
stimulants and tonics In an. effort to
restore functional vigor can have but
one final resultâ ths condition is ren-
dered worse than before. "Weakness"
Is merely an Indication of a low form
of Inflammation In thÂ» prostate rland.
and this Inflammation Is but aggra-
vated by stimulating remedies that
excite temporary activity. I employ
the only scientific and fully effective
treatment for \u25a0"Weakness" which- **â¢
fects a permanent cure by restoring:
the prostate eland to a sound- and
; healthy stats. I obtain complete re-
sults In every ease I treat.
