Jlarriage Follows Closely Upon the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 11.âA. Hart
McKee, who was divorced a few
days ago by Mrs. Eliza Sutton McKee,
and Mrs. Hugh Cornelia Baxter Tevis,
former wife of Hugh Tevis of Califor
nia, were married to-night in the
Hotel Walton. The ceremony was wit
nessed by Mr. and Mrs. H. Sellers
l'iKe>;. parents of the bridegroom,
and Mr. and Mis. G. M. Baxter, par
ents of the bride- It was performed
..by Rev. Dr. Hill, pastor of the First
:Presbyterian Church of this city.
Owing to the publicity that has at
tended recent events in the lives of
4x>th McKee and Mrs. Tevis, efforts
â¢were made to ha%e the marriage quiet,
and at first to prevent the hotel em
ployes giving out any notice of the
aflair. Mrs. Tevis did not even regis
ter at the hoteL She arrived with her
parents early in the afternoon and
â¢was accompanied by a maid.
McKee did not register either. After
' his arrival a big box of roses was sent
to MrK. Tevis' room, and soon after 3
o'clock the wedding party gathered in
one of the parlors of the hoteL
Mrs. Tevis is considered one of the
most beautiful women in the WesL
McKee is not only the son of a Pitts
burg millionaire, but has more than
a million dollars in his own righL
Friends of both families say the rea
â¢son the marriage was performed in
this city was the desire of both fam
ilies to avoid any further sensation in
the home cities.
The announcement of the McKee di
vorce was a sui prise to Pittsburg, but
the marriage of A. Hart McKee and
â¢Mrs. Hugh Tevis was not unexpected
by their friends. It was generally un
derstood that when McKee obtained his
freedom from his wife, who had insti
. tuted divorce proceedings, he would
marry Mrs. Tevis.
McKee sailed for Europe on October
'â¢5, accompanied by Mrs. Tevis and her
small son. While the couple were in
Europe frequent reports were received
â¢fn this city of their constant compan
ionship. McKee returned to this city a
; few weeks ago, leaving Mrs. Tevis in
Paris. On his return he denied that he
had any intention of marrying Mrs.
'.T-evis. He declared he had never been
engaged to her and insisted that he
. had no knowledge of her whereabouts.
. McKee is the son of Sellers McKee,
who made $15,000,000 in the glass busi
ness in Pittsburg. He was named as
: co-respondent in the suit for divorce
brought by her husband against Mrs.
Genevieve C Phipps. Later it was said
that McKee and Mrs. Phipps were en
gaged, but that the engagement was
broken when McKee and Mrs. Tevis
sailed away together.

QUESTION OF FEDERAL PATRONAGE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. n.â Frank P. Flint, United States
Senator-elect, was asked this afternoon on behalf of The Call
where he would be found in the event of a clash between Presi
dent Roosevelt and the of the great trusts and
railwny corporations of the country. He replied:
"I will stand by the President. You cannot make the
declaration in this respect too strong for me. I now say that it
is my purpose to resign the attorneyship of all corporations for
which Jam counsel. This includes the Associated Oil Company.
I will accept no employment from railway or other corporations
during my term as Senator, and my law partner will take the
same course. I am heartily in accord with the President in
his efforts to broaden the powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission and to abolish rebates and regulate private car lines."'
ALWAYS* VOTED FOR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS.
It was remarked to Mr. Flint that much had been said on
the quiet during the Senatorial to the effect that he had
been a Cleveland Democrat.
"There is no truth in the story." said the Senator-elect.
"When 1 was studying law 1 held a clerkship in the oftice of D.
R. Risky, United States Marshal, but* I have voted right along
for Republican Presidents. This fact is well known to Republi
cans in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Reports to the contrary
have no foundation in fact.''
As the topic of Federal patronage is already engaging the at
tention of the Legislature, Mr. Flint was asked if there was any
truth in the stories that promises ni patronage had already been
made and that several aspirants for lucrative positions in the Fed
eral service had been slated.
DISTRIBUTION OF FEpERAL PATRONAGE.
The Senator replied: "There is absolutely-no truth in these
stories. I have not made a single promise in this regard and no
one has been authorized to make any promises for me. I shall be
guided in the distribution of patronage by the judgment of Sen
ator Perkins and the recommendation of the Republican organ
ization and party leaders in this State. The Republican State
Central Committee, of which General Stone is chairman, and the
several county committees throughout the State will be recognized
as elements of the organization."
The Senator-elect frankly responded to all the inquiries pro
pounded, and expressed special delight over the manly letter from
George A. Knight. He spoke in the very highest terms of his old
friend. Senator Thomas R. Bard, and expressed sentiments of
friendship for Arthur G. Fisk and Henry T. Oxnard.

Stanford Professor
Arrested and
Fined.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO, Jan. 11.âProfessor C.
H. Gilbert, head of the department of
zoology of Stanford University and
chairman of the scholarship committee,
was arrested last night for riding a
bicycle on the sidewalk, contrary to a
city ordinance, and on appearing before
Justice M. H. Thomas at noon to-day
was fined $10 for his Indiscretion.
The ordinance under which Professor
Gilbert was fined went into effect on
January 1, and was intended as a pro
tection against student "sprinters,"'
who race from the university through
Palo Alto to their boarding places. The
fact that a university professor was
the first to be arrested has caused con
siderable amusement among the citi
zens of Palo Alto and actual hilarity
among the students of the university,
Who regard the fining of Dr. Gilbert as
a huge joke.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAGRAMENTO, Jan. 11.âThe Sena
torial contest having been settled, Re
publican leaders in the Senate and As
sembly will put forward their best ef
forts to bring the Legislature down to
the regular business of the session.
There is a general feeling that the
election of a Republican of the south
will tend to the perpetuation of unity
and strength in the party. No scan
dals or stories concerning the lavish or
imporper use of money mar the har
mony of the occasion. In all the camps
it is conceded that the Senator-elect
is a high-minded and deserving citizen
whose career in the United States Sen
ate will reflect credit on California.
While there are many comments on
the line that the ' organization" early
in the campaign slated Flint for the
toga, the best information obtainable
is to the effect that the Herrin or rail
road end. of the organization did hold
"hands off" until last Saturday night,
when the head of the law department
decided to send Ruef to Sacramento to
settle the fight by casting his strength
in favor of Flint. It was positively
known at railroad headquarters that
Ruef would not help Knight. The dis
position of the Fisk forces was never
in doubt. As announced exclusively in
The Call yesterday, George Hatton
came here and arranged with Arthur
Fisk for a transfer of the Perkins sym
pathetic vote from the Postmaster of
San Francisco to Flint.
It now dawns on Knight's friends
that neither Senator Perkins nor Wll
FRANK P. FLINT, WHO WAS ELECTED YESTERDAY TO SUCCEED THOMAS R. BARD IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
11am F. Herrid favored the candidacy
of the orator from the Redwoods.
When Jim Oil lis programmed the
Sacramento delegation for Knight,
Flint was depressed, but the depression
was soon relieved. It transpires now
that the transfer was made in order to
keep Knight in the field, by holding out
to him the prospect of ultimate suc
cess.
The letter from Senator Bard to Dr.
Rowell, which the latter now
is accepted as proof that the Senator
never cared very much whether success
or defeat should follow his reluctant
candidacy. Dr. Rowell wired to the
Senator to-day that the game was fin
ished. He expressed his own sense of
disappointment with the hope that the
defeat might prove a blessing in dis
guise. The men who gave their sup
port to Bard are not sullen or vindic
tive. They feel that they gave their
support to one of the noblest men of
California, and they refer with spe
cial satisfaction to the belief that they
will be known to Republicans of the
future *aa men who refused to bow to
the railroad yoke.
United States Senator-elect Frank
P. Flint will be in San Francisco to
morrow and will spend several hours ln
the metropolis. He will leave Sacra
mento at 7 o'clock in the morning with
his formidable array of Los Angeles
supporters and will reach the bay
about 11 o'clock. He will depart for

SIGNIFICANCE OF TERMS
"PHYSICIAN" AND "DOCTOR"
Latter Term Now Very Promiscuously
Applied to Many M'rongfully.
The Society of Medical Jurisprudence
on Monday night took action leading
toward the stricter and more exact use
of words, which ought to be commend
ed by all people having at heart that
feature of good English style. Hereafter
the society is to designate its medical
members as "physicians" and not as
"doctors." One of the most frequent
mistakes made by people who use the
language loosely is the employment of
generic words where the specific are
demanded.
Few persons realize that a physician
is a doctor, but that there are plenty of
doctors who are not physicians. The
elements of etymology show that doctor
means teacher, the Idea being, of
cuurse, that a man who has attained a
doctorate in any subject is so well
versed in that subject that he can
teach it
The medical practitioner's occupation
is that of a physician, and his title is
that of doctor simply because after a
rigorous course in medicine the
academic degree of doctor of medicine
has been conferred on him. If a man
has a doctorate in laws or in divinity
he is as much entitled to be called
"doctor" as he who has a doctorate in
medicine. Yet we constantly hear peo
ple say, "He's a doctor," meaning a
physician, as If "physician" and "doc
tor" were necessarily synonymous.â

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
WASTING AWAY
It's the small but constant
loss of flesh that indicates
physical waste â the gradual
slipping away of healthy flesh,
pound by pound, which no
ordinary food seems to re
store. Scott's Emulsion will
restore it. This Emulsion is
the greatest flesh builder ob
tainable. Scott's Emulsion
first stops the wastingâthat's
one gain. Then when it sup
plies new flesh and takes one
back to normal strength and
weight, that's another gain
and a big one.

Hand Control of Torpedos.
"Every country has Its heroes, and
it is refreshing to read something of
the heroic In the history of countries
south of us," said a thoughtful man.
"In a recent history of South America
attention is called to a number of
things which tend to show that the
popular estimate of valor and heroism
in that section of the world may not
be altogether the correct one. It is
related that once the Peruvian monitor
Huascar fought against three Chilean
ships.
"After both Admiral Grau and his
flag lieutenant were killed. Captain
Aguirre took command, was killed, and
then succeeded by Captain Carbajal,
who was put hors de combat by a shell.
The command devolved then on Lieu
tenant Rodriguez, who was killed, then
on Lieutenant Palaciaus. who was dis
abled, and finally Lieutenant Gareyon,
with the ship on fire, three feet of
water in the hold, and with a loss of
haif his officers and crew, was forced
to strike his flag. On July 23, 1870. the
Huascar was in action against the
Chilean ship Abtao. Torpedoes at that
time were not much understood, and
one being fired from the Huascar.
through faulty mechanism returned
back straight upon the ship. Seeing
this, and knowing that If the ship was
struck she must sink, Lieutenant Diaz
Cansco jumped overboard and in the
water with his hands altered its course
just before it came ln contact with the
ship."âNew Orleans Times-Democrat.
New Way of Gilding.
One more proof that all is not gold
that glitters is found in the fact that
much of the gold lettering seen on
signs and also much of the gilding of
picture frames has no gold whatever
about it. Among laymen the opinion
prevails that all such decoration re
quires the actual use of gold leaf, but
the reality is different and a substi
tute that defies detection lid's been
widely used for some time. The exact
effect of gold is secured by using "a
leaf of either silver or aluminum un
der yellow paint. $ The metal backing
gives the required luster and the paint
gives the required color. This method
cannot be used in all cases, because
the paint Is of peculiar quality and
requires putting on with an even
thickness. For this reason It Is gen
erally applicable only to flat surfaces.
Parts of a gilded picture frame which
are molded into waving surfaces gen
erally require genuine gold leaf to
cover them.âPhiladelphia Record.
Felt Bound to Do So.
Representative BrownloW looks like
the Tennessee mountaineer that he is.
Stocky and broad, he tips the scales
at considerably over 200, as does Rep
resentative Sims, to whom he was
talking recently.
"When I first ran for Congress,"
said he, "there were several candi
dates in the race. We had all as
sembled at a certain" town and were
on one platform at a public meeting.
There was a rough old fellow in the
audience, who was looking the aspi
rants over with a critical eye. One of
them had done him several favors
and he felt in duty bound to vote for
that man, who, however, he had never,
seen before.
" Not a very promising lot, are
they?* observed this mountaineer
philosopher after a while. "Them's
only the kind we used to run for Con
stable when I was a boy. Thar's my
candidate. I'd given $10 if I hadn't

HOW TO IMPROVE
YOUR SECKEL PEAR
Its Size May Be Greatly Increased
by Proper System of
Grafting.
If the Seckel pear were ever as big
as it is gdod what a bouncer it would
be. writes a correspondent of the Agri
culturist. Exceedingly sweet, rich
flavored and melting, its one great
defect is lack of size. It is the aim of
every grower to raise the largest speci
mens possible, for it is size that takes
the premium every time. Some time
ago an old nurseryman let me Into the
secret of raising extra-sized deckels
and, as the Information was given
without any promise of secrecy being
exacted, my brother farmers are wel
come to share it with meânot that I
am ready personally to indorse it, for
I have not as yet made a test of It,
though intending to do so.
"If you want size In your Seckels,"
said the old gentleman, "bud them into
top branches of a Beurre Hardy tree
and you will be sure to get it." He
gave me no reason why the Hardy
should be especially selected for this
purpose. Assifming that it was be
cause it imparted some of its vigorous
growth into the slow-growing Seckel,
then one might suggest why not an
ticipate as good results if either of
those rank growers, Anjou or Diel,
were selected as the mother tree? Of
course, one cannot find in a nursery
catalogue Seckels advertised as having
been worked Into the tops of the
Hardy, but I suppose it would not be
an impossible thing to find a nursery
man who. at a reasonable price for his
extra trouble, would breed and supply
them on order.âBaltimore American.
Woman Kept Light 38 Years.
For thirty-eight years a woman has
kept the light off Santa Barbara. The
lighthouse is situated about two miles
southwest of Santa Barbara on a low
point of land, the light being 178 feet
above the sea. The tower rises from the
center of a small white building with
the usual red roof and green shutters,
with a tiny porch opening toward the
sea. .
The building was erected in 1856 and
its first keeper was Albert J. Williams,
the husband of Mrs. Julia F. Williams,
the present keeper. He received his ap
pointment when Franklin J. Pierce was
President. The light is a fixed white of
the first order, and may be seen seven
teen miles at sea. Just as the Civil War
was closing in 1865 Mrs. Williams was
appointed keeper in place of her hus
band, who had died, and she has had
the longest service of any keeper on
the Coast.
Mrs. Williams has been away from
her post but two nights in twenty-sev
en years, and does not go away in the
daytime save on Sunday, when she
rides into town fb attend the Congre
gational Church, of which she has long
been a member. The family came orig
inally from Maine. When they came
to the lighthouse in 1856 Mr. and Mrs.
Williams had two little daughters, and
while there two sons were born to them
and one child died.âLos Angeles Times.

BADDELEY
A DAD MAN
SAY POLICE
More Evidence Showing His
Association With Train
Robber Gang and Murder
Theory Is Strengthened
BEST CLEW SO FAR
IX OAKLAND CASE
Detective Matheson at Work
Among Saloons That Have
Been Held Up Trying to
Have Suspect Identified
More evidence was gathered yester
day tending to show that Ben Badde
ley, who stepped unwittingly into the
toils of the law when he accused Mrs.
Minnie Segger. his former paramour,
with bigamy, has been asosclated with
"Black Joe's" gang of train robbers
in the Middle West.
The best theory that has been
evolved as to the identity of the mur
derer of Policeman George W. Brown,
who was shot down in Oakland a few
weeks ago, was developed yesterday,
pointing to Baddeley as the man who
fired the fatal bullet.
Deputy Sheriff Newsome of Stani
slaus County arrived in the city yes
terday and told of the contents of let
ters Baddeley had written to Mrs.
Segger, with whom he was infatuated,
in whiclv he stated that he was en
gaged In criminal operations in the
East He was in St! Louis at the
time, and among other things wrote
In one missive that he was about to
take a trip to the ex
pected to come back with a good
haul." These letters were forwarded
to Detective O'Keefe of Chicago some
time ago.
Detective Matheson. who is hand
ling the case, believes there is also
jrood ground to suspect the prisoner
af the murder of Policeman Brown
in Oakland, and is diligently working
an that phase. The general descrip
tion obtained from the several per
sons who saw the murderer running
iway after the shooting and from the
man whom he had just held up tal
lies to a nicety.
The murderer was described as five
s#et Aye or six inches in height. Bad
leley measures five feet five and a
half Inches.
The weight of Policeman Brown's
slayer was estimated at 140 pounds.
Baddeley weighs <12 pounds. The
roan who killed the policeman was
jaid to be of slender build, and this,
>00, fits Ac suspected train robber
md murderer.
The bullet that caused the death of
[he mounted officer was of 38 cali
3er. The revolver found in Baddeley's
-oorri after his arrest is of that cal
ber. \
KEST THEORY IN MURDER CASE.
"While direct evidence is altogether
acklng, 1 think the probabilities are
mffleiently strong to justify a thor
ough investigation on the theory that
t was Baddeley who committed the
murder," said Detective Matheson
yesterday. "It is certainly the best
;lew that has been developed so far.
[ believe that we have got our hands
jn a thoroughly bad man. While I
lo not regard Baddeley as a keen
*iminal, but rather one of the 'hobo'
:ype, I think many crimes could be
laid to him If his record were laid
oare."
The detective spent most of yester
lay visiting saloons and other places
that have been held up during the last
several months and seeking for some
Identification of Baddeley by means
3f a photograph.
"Bobby" Johnson, the welterweight
pugilist and husband of the woman ac
cused of bigamy, told Captain Burnett
yesterday of a cipher letter from
"Black Joe" to Baddeley, from which
It appears that the former accused the
latter of having robbed him. Trans
lated, the missive read: "Fetch back
that money yOu stole from me, or I
will hang you." Johnson said he had
destroyed the letter.
Deputy Sheriff Newsome says that
the three letters that were sent to the
Chicago detective were full of incrim
inating matter connecting Baddeley
with the gang of robbers headed by
"Black Joe," whose name is said to be
Joe Palmer. When Mrs. Segger first
Intimated to the Stanislaus authorities
that Baddeley was a train robber, De
tective O'Keefe was notified and he
came out from Chicago. But he said
the descriptions of the hold up men did
not agree with Baddeley, whose stat
ure was much too small.
Nothing has been heard from Chi
cago concerning developments ln De
tective O'Keefe's investigations. The
local police heard nothing from St.
Louis yesterday, not learning till late
In the day that O'Keefe Is connected
with the Chicago force. It is expected
to hear from him ln a few days and
that further light can then be gained
on Baddeley's career.
MRS. SEGGER ARRAIGNED.
The charge of bigamy against Mrs.
Segger, preferred by Baddeley in
revenge because she had married John
son, was taken up by Judge Mogan
yesterday, but at the request of the
District Attorney was put over to Jan
uary 13 that records may be looked up.
l'he woman said Bhe thought Segger
was dead when she married the fighter.
She lived with Baddeley for eighteen
nonths at Newman, Stanislaus County,
where they kept a dance hall, "and since
rhe left him, she says, he has never
:eesed his pleadings for her to return
to him. She still adheres to her orig
nal story as to Baddeley's record, and
aer anger toward her accuser has not
ibated.
Captain Burnett last night had Ed
P*inn, better known as "Mickey,"
irought before him, Finn having been
in associate and roommate of Baddeley
'or some time. He, too, had seen the
etters that Mrs. Segger received from
he suspected train robber and had also
leard Baddeley make mention ln a
reneral way of his exploits. Finn was
convinced, he said, that the prisoner
SOLDIER THUG
SHOOTS VICTIM
J. D. Bulger Is Held Up and
Wounded Inside Gate of
the Presidio Reservation
ONE FOOTPAD ESCAPES
Lieutenant G. C. Mullin and
Three Privates Arrest
Highwayman Near Scene
Two soldiers held up James D. Bul
ger last night just inside the Seventh
avenue gate of the Presidio. Because
Bulger resisted one of the soldiers,
Private George Caesar, fired point
blank at him. The bullet made ah ugly
flesh wound in Bulger's head. Caesar
was caught shortly afterward by Lieu
tenant George C. Mullin and three pri
vates of the guard.
The hold-up took place shortly after
8 o'clock. Bulger entered the Presidio
gate and was walking through Lovers'
lane. Two soldiers suddenly darted
from behind a clump of trees. One of
them leveled a revolver and ordered
Bulger to throw up his hands.
"Be hanged if I will," retorted Bulger
and reached for his pistol. The thug
sprang at the civilian and beat him
on the head. Bulger attempted to
strike back, whereupon the soldier
fired. Bulger fell stunned and the
highwaymen fled.
Lieutenant Mullin, who was officer of
the guard at the Twentieth Infantry
cantonment, heard the shot. Taking
three men, he ran up the road in the
direction from which the sound came.
As the men reached the spot where
Bulger lay they saw a man skulking
through the brush. They ordered him
to come forth. He obeyed and when
searched two revolvers were found, his
own and one which Bulger identified as
his.
The footpad and his victim were
taken to the Twentieth Infantry Regi
mental Hospital. There a sergeant
identified the criminal as Private
George Caesar of Company I, Tenth
Infantry. Bulger declared In the pres
ence of twenty privates and Lieutenant
Mullin that Caesar was the man who
shot him. Oetectives Dinan, Wren and
Reynolds were detailed on the case, but
Caesar is held by the Presidio authori
ties pending action of the commandant.
Bulger's son was robbed near the same
place a few months ago. Caesar's
"pal" Is still at large.
SHOT DOWN IN THE STREET.
Henry Smith Fires Two Bullets Into
J. R. McCann.
Joseph R. McCann, a stonecutter,
was shot twice and probably fatally
wounded by Henry Smith, a worthless
character, at Taylor and Eddy streets
shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday af
ternoon. .They had begun a quarrel
in a nearby saloon, but Smith was or
dered out. McCann waited in the sa- I
loon for a quarter of an hour, think- |
ing that Smith might go away, but i
McCann found Henry Smith \ind a
brother, Fred Smith, waiting for him. i
According to bystanders. Smith '
drew his revolver after a number of
hot words and McCann closed on him j
and tried to pinion his arms. But 'â 
Smith fired twice, one bullet piercing
a lung and the other entering the ab- i
domen. The infuriated Smith tried to
shoot again, but Andrew Roberts, a !
spectator, ran up and wrested the
weapon from him.
The quarrel in the saloon is said to
have started over some statements al
leged to have been made by McCann
concerning Smith's mother, who con
ducts a shady resort at 115 Mason
street. It appears that the McCann
and Smith families lived together a
number of years ago and bitter feel- j
ing arose between them.
It is said that the victim has a fair
chance of recovery. To the police
Smith said his memory was an utter
blank as to what had occurred. He
has a bad reputation, being an asso
ciate of depraved men and women of
his class.

STEPFATHER SHOOTS BETRAYER.
Tells Police That Victim Wronged His
Stepdaughter.
Suddenly pushing through the
swinging doors of a saloon at the
northeast corner of Bryant and Fourth
streets yesterday afternoon at S
o'clock, Thomas Dougherty sent a bul
let Into the body of Frank Teirnan,
who was standing at the bar. Teir
nan dropped to a chair and exclaimed
that he was shot. Word was sent to
the Southern police station and Cap
tain SplUane detailed Patrolmen Till
man and Gaston to investigate. They
had Teirnan conveyed to the Emer
gency Hospital, where Dr. Carl G,
Wilson made an examination of his
injuries. It was found that the bullet
had entered at the sixth rib on the
left side under the shoulder blade,
passed through a portion of the spinal
column and into the 16ft lung.
In the meantime Officers Clay and
Dowd went to the residence of
Dougherty at 25% Welch street and
placed him under arrest on the charge
of attempt to commit murder. The
accused was taken to the Emergency
Hospital, where he was Identified by
Ttirnan.
The wounded man was sulky and
uncommunicative and declined to
throw any light on the trouble that
led to the shooting. Not so, however,
with Dougherty, who declared that
before Teirnan had been sent to the
County Jail for petty larceny he
had betrayed Dougherty's step

girl 15 years of age. Since his re

had a bad record, but had no definite
Information to give the captain of de

Finn was unable to give any light on
the movements of Baddeley that would
tend to connect him with the Oakland
crime.
"We have not yet succeeded in fast
ening anything on Baddeley, but I am
sure that we have a bad man ln cus

closed his office last night. "I think
there Is much opportunity for hard
work on the case."

fcas been expressed among some of the
politicians that have gathered here as
to the absence of use of what they term
â¢'practical politics" on behalf of the
candidacy of Senator Thomas R. Bard
lor re-election. But the, explanation of
this condition does naught but reflect
the highest credit on Senator Bard, and
no better one can be given than that
contained in a letter bearing date of
January 2 written by Senator Bard to
State Senator Chester Rowell regarding
the Senatorial contest. This letter Sen
ator Rowell consented to make public
this evening. It is as follows:
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan- 2. IJWfl.âTo
Hon. Chester Rowell, Sacramento, Cal.âMy
Dear Lvrur: I regretted that I could not
"consistently send you this morning a mora
satisfactory reply to the telegram received late
last night, signed by yourself and Senators Bel
i-haw and Anderson and Assemblymen Perkins,
Drew and Pyle. l was very much terupted,
after announcing my inability to go to Sacra
memo immediately, to say to the six gentle
men who sent the telegram that 1 would leave
to them to do and say anything which in
their judgment it was proper for me to say
and do under all circumstances In respect to
promoting my candidacy. I feel absolutely
sure that what thesÂ»e friends might recom
mend to do would be inspired only by honor
able motives, and that nothing that they would
do or say for me would In any degree com
mit me to any unwise, indiscreet or Improper
declarations or act. Still Ido not believe that
any authorization of that kind is needed. I
think that you especially will understand, for
example, lhat I will make no premises for
the distribution of patronage or the advocacy
of or oDposition to any private legislation meas
ure: that I would prefer to be defeated, and
dof.at"d by an overwhelming vote, rather than
to deviate from the line or conduct which I
have substantially laid down for myself In
to my candidacy in the old letters,
which were published and which constitute
1 c cniy announcement or my willingness to
be a candidate for re-elecUon.
PLACES FAITH IX FRIENDS.
1 can easily anticipate that my friends will
be called upon to say for me at least that 1
have no prejudices which will prevent me from
giving: proper consideration to the recommenda
tion of any representative Republican ln the
State; that I have no prejudices which will
prevent me from dealing fairly and honestly
with the interests of any section of the State
or any private Interests which may be In
volved In any legislative measure or policy In
which I may be called upon to participate.
There may arise some questions upon which
my attitude may with propriety be made
known In advance. I realize that my friends
and supporters may be unable to speak for me
ln such matters, and it is possible that I my
self might not have sufficient information orn
cernin.if audi matters to enable me, ln ad
vance, to express an opinion. But in a general
way it is practicable and proper. If necessary,
for a group of my most active friends, includ
ing always yourself, acting sn concert to com
mit me to some policies which are not the
mbject or conscience or concerning which I
have no formed or unalterable convictions.
I appreciate that exigencies may arise in my
absence where such action may be necessary.
I must lo.t.'Ss that the expression in this
telegram of oeiief that my presence at Sac
ramento is absolutely necessary seemed to be
en int (nation that things are not going along
quite satisfactorily and that the situation can
'only be improved by my, personal participation
In thÂ» ranvasa. /That, you know, is distaste
ful to me, but nevertheless I realize that it is
my duty, whenever possible', to uphold the
efforts of my friends to re-elect me. If the
way were clear I would immediately start for
Eacramento. but several important duties de
volve upon me now.
REMAINS AT POST OF DITTY.
In the first place. Inasmuch as I am the
only Republican member of the Committee
en Territories who i s in opposition to the
Statehood i,;]| an especial responsibility rests
upon me in that matter, and as in all prob
ability the statehood bill will be taken up
for consideration immediately after Congress
â¢hall have reconvened and that the debate In
the Senate will consume several days and may
be postponed from time to time, I could not
possibly send 'you a more encouraging reply
to the telegram. There is 'a probability that
.the order now fixe.l by the steering committee
may be chanted an<! that the pure ,'ood bill
may be given preference over the statehood
bill. In such case there will still he some
uncertainty abdut my able to get away.
On the other hand (he statehood bill may be
firessed to a vote immediately, notwithstandi
ng there will be strong opposition, and l>e
disposed of in time for me to reach Sacra
mento before a decisive vote 'or Senator shall
be taken. It is very probable, however, that
the Important matters already referred to and
other more Important matter* which will be
referred to the Committee on Irrigation, of
which I am chairman, will rÂ»nder it impos
sible for me. consistently, with my sense of
duty, to absent myself from my own com
mittee meetings and the Senate .hamper.
I am hoping that my attitude with reference
to the statehood matter may be appreciated
and approved by the people of my State. Mr
Beveridge gave notice that he would r a ]| up
the bill for consideration immediately after
the morning s?ssion of the 4th instant. Re
member, dear doctor, that while it may be
n disappointment to you if my candidacy shall
not be successful I shall not fret about the

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 11.âFrank P.
Flint of Los Angeles is to be the next

reached at 9:50 o'clock this morning at
a caucus called by Flint's supporters
and held in the Assembly chamber of |

caucus last night, Flint's managers |
were active early this morning and by j

"Governor Pardee has programmed

Anderson, and Lukens withdrew his
motion.
CHEERS FOR THE VICTOR.
As the legislators left th*; Assembly

corridors ring with slogans for both
Flint and the defeated candidates.
Governor Pardee was raised aloft on
the shoulders of the enthusiastic law
makers and carried to his office.
Senator-elect Flint was accorded a
tremendous ovation as he left the Capi
tol. He was carried on the shoulders
of his admirers and. after visiting the
Governor's office, left for his hotel.

his success. He held an informal re
ception at his headquarters, where he
was congratulated by his managers
and friends.
George A. Knight, one of the Sena
torial candidates, appeared at the Capi
tol after the caucus and gracefully ac
cepted his defeat.
"My defeat was Inevitable, so It
seems.'' said Knight. "There were cer
tain political combinations which made
it impossible for me to win. It might
have been different if the Senatorial
question had been submitted to a vote
of the people." he said.

Â«
MAKES BRIEF ADDRESS
Senator-Elect Speaks a Few
Words, but Does Not Make
Any Reference to Politics
Special D:scatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan, 11. â Wine
flowed and cheers rent the air at the
1 Golden Eagle Hotel again to-night, the
occasion being a reception given to
Senator-elect Flint. The Los Angeles
spirit of enthusiasm was dominant.
There was a crush of people. Nearly
every legislator in town and hundreds
of other visitors called to pay their re
spects to the newly elected Senator and
partake of the hospitality offered.
The reception was held in the de
serted headquarters of Candidate
j George A. Knight, the parlor of the
hotel, and where that aspirant
! had just closed his losing fight
the shouts of victory rang. Several
handsome floral pieces sent by admir
ing friends stood at various places in
the room, one of thefh being from B.
W. Cavanaugh. and another from D.
Hewes, Flint's uncle.
The guests passed in through the
main door and out another toward the
rear, progress necessarily being slow
because of the crush in the room. In
one corner stood Mr. Flint with a
hf;nd-grasp for all, but before he
eculd be reached by them guests had
to be announced by a crowd of Los
.Angeles booster.-, who performed the
ceremony much after the fashion of a
I lodge initiation. The merriment grew
| greater earn moment.
Nearly everybody made a speech.
| Flint spoke a few words, making no
!mt ntton of politics. He said he could
| not find phrases adequate to- express
i his gratitude, but he wanted it under
, stood that he was grateful and that
' there had never been a moment of his
i liff- when he felt he ow ? ed a greater
debt of gratitude. He said he was not
the Senator of San Francisco or Los
Angeles but of the whole State.
Un.de Hewes, with his happy smile
and smoked glasses, was a prominent
member of the assemblage and was
congratulated by many of the guests.
Setiator Belshaw made one of the prin
cipal speeches. It was highly eulogistic
|of Flint and he even announced that
!he would support Flint six years from
! now. Mrs. Belshaw was brought in by
! her husband with four other ladies and
' three cheers were given for them. Then
cheers were given for Mrs. Flint and
Uncle Hewes called for three more for
the Senator-elect's mother and these
I were given heartily.
Oscar Lawler made a talk for the Los
Angeles delegation and Assemblyman
McGowan spoke from the shoulders of
a crowd of revelers, who thus elevated
him. Assemblyman Rolley was among
j the foremost of those shouting for
j Flint. Senator Selvage made a speech
of some duration. An orchestra dis
pensed music just outside the room
while the merry-making was going on
and there was singing.
FIFTY-THREE DAYS IN SNOW
WITH A VIOLENT MANIAC
WINNIPEG, Man.. Jan. 11.âCorporal
Field of the Royal Mounted Police has
Just arrived at Edmonton, the most'
northern railroad station in the North
west Territory, bringing with him a
maniac missionary. Corporal Fields
was stationed at Fort Chippeway. He
was directed to proceed to another sta
tion in the Arctic Circle and escort the
madman to Edmonton. He traveled
by dog sled, using seven dogs and
traveled light.
It took him fourteen days to reach
the station where he was to meet his
charge. Here he found a missionary
named Buckman. who had become a
raving maniac in the lonely solitude.
Then began his long Journey with his
demented charge. He had not pro
ceeded far when the missionary became
violent and it was necessary to strap
him to the sled. Then the man refused
to eat, scratching and biting Field
whenever the latter sought to force
food down his throat. For fifty-three
days' this journey continued through
blinding snowstorms and the wind
swept prairies. -*
Field finally arrived at Edmonton
with the madman, where attendants
took him 2400 miles to the asylum at
Brandon. Field was exhausted and is
now slowly recovering his lost strength
under medical care. He says It was
the most discouraging, lonely and dif
ficult trip he ever made and the # author
ities say it has never been equaled.

HINTS AT EARLY PEACE.
Russian Admiral Says Second War
Will Follow Lull in Fighting.
PARIS, Jan. 11.âThe declaration
made by Vice Admiral Doubasoff. the
Russian member of the International
commission to inquire into the North
Sea incident, in an interview, to the ef
fect that an honorable peace between
Russia and Japan was likely to be con
cluded, is considered highly significant.
The Admiral, who is chief of naval
construction, says he submitted to Em
peror Nicholas last Thursday a plan
to complete the rehabilitation of the
navy. The Emperor gave It favorable
consideration and said it would be sub
mitted to the Council of Ministers.
"I am convinced," said Admiral Dou
basoff. "of the Immediate necessity for
the reconstruction of our fleet at all
the Russian and foreign shipyards, for
the purpose of , securing strength
sufficient to command supremacy at
sea. This Is absolutely indispensable
If we are to expect victory ln the next
war with Japan. The remnant of our
fleet is hardly more than debris and
entirely unequal to Japan's naval
strength."
The Admiral further said It was
necessary to recognise these conditions,
however painful they might be to na
tional self-love.
"Therefore," he said, "I do not hesit
ate to say that "we tend toward not
far-off peace. We will lÂ«ave to the
Japanese Port Arthur and the territory
they now occupy In Manchuria. We
will set ourselves resolutely at work to
prepare an invincible navy, as this
peace will be but temporary and the
next time we shall be amply prepared."
PLAIN TALK TO THE CZAR.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 11.âTire
Metropolitan of St. Petersburg In a ser
mon preached before the Imperial fam
ily at Tsarskoe-Selo yesterday, on the
occasion of the religious festival of
Christmas, drew a parallel between the
peace of the Gospel and the peace of
Flint soon became active in politics and
was among the earliest Californians
to advocate McKinley's nomination for
the Presidency. Upon that event tak
ing place he became President of the
Los Angeles McKlnley Club. As a re
ward for his activity during the cam
paign he was appointed United States
District Attorney of the Southern Dis
trict of California by President McKln
ley. He served for four years and then
accepted the position of attorney for
the Southern Pacific Railroad In Los
Angeles. About the middle of last July
he announced his candidacy for the
United States Senate.
Flint was married in 1889 to Miss
Katherlne Blocs of Los Angeles, whose
father was at one time a well-known
business man of Merced. They have
two children, a boy and a girl. Sena
tor-elect Flint's mother lives in Los
Angeles. She has married again and
her name now is Mrs. Danskin.
the world. In concluding he addressed
the Emperor as follows:
"Tour Imperial Majesty, may Goxf
grant that thÂ« present war will soon
end. Above all, may God grant that
the angelic message of peace sink deep
er and deeper into the hearts of m;n
and that strife may soon end forever
on, earth."
In a leading editorial to-day the
Russ, while maintaining that the war
must go on, says: "But the fullest suc
cess is only achievable if the nation is
united," and declares that, after all.
"the question of peace or war abroad
is a minor matter. What Russia wants
is peace at home, as war at home is far
worse than that in Manchuria."
Then, in the plainest fashion, the
Russ sketches the internal conditions,
which it says "are tantamount to a
state of war. producing mortality
among the peasant children equal to
that of the battlefield." concluding with
the statement that the "work of regen
eration must begin nowâwe cannot
wait until the war in the Far East is
ended."

SENATE HEARS
NEWLANDS' PLAN
Xevadan Presents Argument
for Federal Incorporation
Act for the Railroads
FOE NATIONAL CONTROL
Controversy Leaves Little
Time to Be Devoted to
the Statehood Measure
WASHINGTON. Jan. 11â The at
tention of the Senate to-day was di
vided between the statehood question
and governmental regulation of rail
toads. Newlands made a formal speech
on the railroads and at its close en
gaged in a controversy over the points
involved with Senators Spooner and
Foraker. All amendments to the state
hood bill except that relating to liquor
t raffle in Indian Territory were agreed
to.
Newlands addressed the Senate on the
joint resolution which he introduced
some days ago. which provides for a
commission with instructions to frame
a national incorporation act for the
< 'instruction of railroads engaged in in
terstate commerce. He said it was time
to ignore State lines in the operation
. and management of railroads, and add
ed that the power sought was constitu
tional and involved no contradiction of
the Democratic views as to the re
served powers of State and local self
government.
Foraker asked Newlands how he pro
posed to secure the reincorporation of
the various railroad companies as pro
posed by his resolution. Newlands re
plied that his measure is so framed as
to partially drive and partially coax
the rules.
Spooner raised 'he point that it would
he impossible by Federal enactment to
regulate commerce between the States.
Newlands replied that he did not con
tend that Congress had power to regu
late commerce confined exclusively to
any one State. He did contend, how
ever, that when the Government con
stunted a railroad no State had power
to tax it out of existence.
The statehood bill was taken up, and
an amendment which will hive the ef
fect of leaving the location of the cap
ital to the Legislature of Oklahoma waj
passed.
The amendment making a donation of
15,000,000 for the benefit of the public
schools of the proposed State of Ari
zona was adopted after striking out
the provision for the payment of in

Confirmation of Report That the 1
Northern Securities Case Is to
Be Settled.
NEW YORK. Jan. 11.âThe report
that a settlement in the Northern Se- \
curities case had been practically
reached hy the Hill and Harriman in- I
terests was confirmed to-day by a high
official of a big Western road which j
has considerable at stake in the matter.
He added:
"Undoubtedly events are progressing
toward a final settlement of this tire
some and expensive litigation that will
be generally satisfactory to everybody.
The Burlington is to play a very prom
inent part in the setlement. It is prob- j
able that the Harriman interests are to I
. have an important voice in the control j
of the Burlington, and they do not care !
anything about Northern Pacific be- j
yond the fact that under the present j
arrangement it controls the Burlington
jointly with the Great Northern. The
strong financial interests of the country
are anxious to see peace and their good
offices are being used to that end. I
think it safe to say that an early set
tlement is at hand."
There is a story in Wall street that
the relations between J. P. Morgan and j
James J. Hill are no longer as cordial '
as they were. Financial interests gen
erally demand a settlement of the fight
in order that the enormous sums held
up in Great Northern and Northern Pa
< ifiv dividends may be disbursed. Hill
thus finds himself in a state of prac
tical financial isolation and has been
persuaded to yield to the suggestions
for a settlement.

FRANTIC "RUN"
UPON A BANK
Policemen Obliged to Use
Their Clubs Upon a Mob
of Frenzied Depositors
NEW YORK, Jan. 11.âThree police
men and two Hebrew women were in
jured in a - ;run" on the State Bank in
Grand street, in the heart of the busi
ness section of the East Side, to-day
The "run" was attended by some sen
sational incidents. The 5900 persons
crowded about the bank became so in
sistent that they broke down an iron
ratling around a light-well in front of
the building, and it was only by des
perate clubbing on the part, of the
police that the excited and unruly mob
was prevented forcing many of its '
members into the well. The policemen
and women were hurt at that point.
The emergency police detail of the
Delancy-street station was finally
called out, and policemen were sta
tioned at interval of five or six feet
for two blocks on each side of the
bank.
The cause of the "run" was as ex
traordinary as the freturted character
of the "run" itself. Yesterday tht>f
was a rush of depositors to get their
money into the bank in tlnie to begin
to draw interest at once and the long
line of waiting depositors convinced
the excitable Hebrews that something
was wrong with the institution. Five
hundred persons waited in front of the
building last nisht and their number
quickly swelled to f>ooo uhen the bank
opened to-day. though not all that
number were depositors.
The bank, which has deposits of $10.
--505,000 and a cash reserve of $4,000,000,
and which. Cashier A. L Voorhees
says, earned 24 per cent profits last
year, sent for money early to-day and
$250,000 was brought by thÂ£ wagon,
largely in specie. At the sight of the
money those waiting seemed only im
patient to get at it. The bank paid off.
the depositors as fast as possible. In
all It paid out to-day $55,000 and re
ceived In deposits $440,000.
Remarkable scenes attended the pay
ing off within the bank. The officers '
paid In two-thirds specie and one-third i
bills and some depositors were fairly l
overwhelmed by the amount of cur- I
rency thrust upon them when they
passed in their books. Immediately
upon getting their money Into their
hands and' becoming convinced that
the bank was able to pay them, the
frantic Hebrews became extremely
anxious to get their money into the
bank again, and several of them creat
ed scenes when the officers refused to
accept It. The depositors were paid in
specie to prevent a redeposit. as this
was the sixth "run" the bank has ex
perienced from equally trivial causes.
Payment of depositors was made up
to 6 o'clock to-night. Officers of the
bank declare it is absolutely sound and
can pay $4,000,000 at an hour's notice.
They received many offers of help to
day and declined most of them.

EXECUTIVE URGES RATIFICATION
OF THE ARBITRATION TREATIES
Emphatic Talk to
the Big Men of
Congress.
Filibuster Operations
Will Prove ol
No Avail,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON,Jan. 11.âThough Pres
ident Roosevelt has yielded to the Re
publican leaders of Congress on the
tariff question and there will be no re
vision ln the immediate future, he to
day took a decided attitude upon two
other questions and threw down the
gage of battle to those who care to take
It up. President Roosevelt has de
clared unequivocally that there must
be legislation Increasing the powers of
the Interstate Commerce Commission â
if not at this session, he will summon
an extraordinary session. He also
caused it to be understood that if any
attempt were made 4o alter the pro
posed arbitration treaties now pending
in the Senate they would be withdrawn.
Leaders in the Senate were told plainly
that the President desired the ratifica
tion of the treaties, and without the
slightest alteration.
It can be said that the President re
gards the interstate commerce question
as the paramount subject now before
the American people. At the confer
ence last Saturday he informed those
whom he had summoned into consulta
tion that in his judgment the question
of railroad freight rates was far more
important trran that of the tariff, and
that while he desired a readjustment
of the existing customs duties he would
not permit any radical differences in
't* Republican party on that question.
He said definitely that he would call an
extra session of Congress to consider
interstate commerce legislation unless
definite action was taken by Congress
at the present session. The interstate
commerce question involved a principle
dear to every right-thinking and right
minded American, precisely as the
whole matter of dealing with corpora
tions Involved a principle, and he would
fight for that principle with all the
power that he possessed.
At the same conference the President
informed the Senators that he desired
the arbitration treaties to be ratified.
The treaties now pending were nego
tiated by Seoetary Hay with the rep
resentatives of the powers, and all of
them were signed in Washington.
Thp conventions entered into were
with France, Great Britain, Germany,
Italy. Portugal, Switzerland, Spain and
Austria-Hungary. The President and
Secretary Hay felt in negotiating the
treaties that a lc-ng step toward uni
versal arbitration and consequently
universal peace had been taken. Both
have expressed surprise that an atti
tude inimical to the conventions should
have been assumed by some of the
Senators.
The President has impressed upon
members c-f Congress,particularly of the
Senate, that he regards the arbitration
treaties ana a formidable navy as the
best assurance of peace the United
States Dossibly could have.
The Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations to-day continued considera
tion of the arbitration treaties.
TALE OF A PURCHASED
SENATORSHIP IS DENIED
WASHINGTON. Jan. 11.âSenator
Knox and Senator Penrose of Penn
sylvania unite in saying there is no
truth in the story that the election of
Knox to the Senate was bought by
friends, who paid $500,000 ln notes
against Senator Quay, Senator Pierce
and other Pennsylvania State leaders,
held by the late S. W. Oliver of Pitts-
burg.
"The story is absurd and untrue,"
said Senator Penrose. "There never
were any notes like those mentioned
or any other kind of notes. Senator
Knox holds his seat without taint of
any kind. It is all a lie."
Senator Knox said: "The story is
untrue in every detail."
George T. Oliver, brother and ex
ecutor of Henry W. Oliver, says the
story is false. '

REPUBLICANS
NOT IN FAVOR
OF REVISION
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST
BUILDING, WASHINGTON,
Jan. 11.â"AH right," said
President Roosevelt to-day. "I
am willing to yield to the sen
timent of Congress and the
country on this subject. There
will be no Andy Johnson busi
ness about this."
And with that the tariff re
vision flag was hauled down
from the staff of the White
House.
"I"nolo Joe" Cannon. Speaker
of the House, won this capitu
lation from the President and
the tariff revisionists and there
will be no overhauling of the
Dingley law by the next Con
gress, in extra or regular ses
sion. Speaker Cannon called
upon the President to-day and
showed hlni the result of a can
vass of the House which had
been made under his direction.
This showed that whatever
might be the sentiment of the
public in favor of revision, the
overwhelming feeling among the
Republican members of Con
gress was against a general re
vision of the tariff. Cannon
told the President that 90 per
cent of the Representatives did
not want any extra session and
at best only a few of them were
in favor of a few minor correc
tions in the Dingley schedules.
The Herald and The CalV
made another canvass of the
Republican members of the
House to-day. The result tal
lies closely with that obtained
by Speaker Cannon. It shows
that 196 members out of a total
Republican membership of 210
arc opposed to an extra session
of Congress and a general re
vision of the tariff.
It Is now generally under
stood that the President will
confine Ids surplus energies to
an attempt to obtain railroad
rate revision and supervision.
Says President's Foot
Is Down Throat of
Wall Street.
Epecia: The Call.
BOSTON. Jan. 11.â Thomas W. Law.
j son issued the following statement to
j day under the caption "Wall Street's
j Mouth and Washington's Foot":
"The wider Wall street opens its
i mouth the further down the President
| rams his Coot. The able Senator from
j Rhode Island is, as every one knows,
', a partner by marriage to John D.
j Rockefeller, his daughter having mar
j tied young Johnle D. Therefore the
I talented Senator from the little State
is the constructive partner of John D.
j "He went to Washington for a sit-
I down with the President. That was
, sufficient for Wall street. The President
i was harnessed, muzzled and shackled,
so far as the tariff was concerned, and.
consequently, shackled, muzzled and
harnessed in regard to all other Wall
street affairs. Poor Wall street! It's
not only the Joke of the civilized world,
but it's rapidly monopolizing tear
drools as well.
"I herewith call attention to the fact
that while figuratively our President
only has one foot down Wall street's
throat, he will have both buried out of
sight there' shortly.
"THOMAS W. LAWSON.
"P. S.âl suppose Wall street will use
the fact of both the President's feet be
ing down its windpipe as a bull point,
and try to make the people believe that
it is swallowing him. T. W. L."

Coast Delegation
Favors Dingley

Takes Leading Part
in Anti-Revision
Campaign.
Speclal Disaatch to The Call. ,
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.âThe Pacific
Coast delegation In Congress, which is
taking a leading part in the propagan
da against tariff revision, made an ef
fort to get together to-day to arrange
for concerted action by all members of
Congress from the Pacific States. The
meeting called for this evening failed
of a quorum, however, probably for the
reason that, because of the announce-
ment that the President would not con
tinue to urge a change in the Dingley
schedules, it was not believed that
there was necessity for prompt action.
It is understood that the sentiment of
the Westerners is practically unani
mous in its opposition to any altera
tions of existing conditions.
All of the leaders of the House ex
cept Representative Payne, chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee,
who is ill, and Representative Tawney
are against revision. The work of
crystallising sentiment against revision
is being done by Representative Dal
zell of Pennsylvania and Grosvenor of
Ohio.
The friends of revision seem to be
taking no active interest ln advancing
their ideas in the House, but claim to
have many members in the various
delegations on their side.

RIPLEY WITHDRAWS HIS
REQUEST FOR A HEARING
tent* Fe's President Does Not Desire
a Reopening of Rebate Case
Inquiry.
CHICAGO, Jan. 11. âPresident E.
P. Ripley of the Santa Fe Railroad
Company, has withdrawn his request
for a hearing before the Interstate
Commerce Commission in the Colo
rado Fuel and Iron Company rebate
case. His reasons for this action are
given by him in the following tele
gram sent to the chairman of the
commission:
Since requesting a hearing in the matter of
the Investigation of the Xew Mexico coal rates
I have been furnished with iiuies of evidence
already taken, and find that there Is no tes
tiniony to support the criticisms of the press
that have concerned me personally the most,
and that, while there may have been technl
cal violations of the law, yet Inasmuch as I
know to have been unintentional and
that they have resulted In Injury to no shipper,
and in view of the fact that the entire matter
is the subject of a pending civil action, which
will be heard before a Federal court. I beg
to withdraw such request.
In regard to the statement that
there had been technical violations of
the law, Ripley said:
I mean that the tariff* we filed with the
commission included the price of the coal and
that there was nothing In the tariffs to show
that this was the case. That Is the way those
matters were customarily handled, and though
not technically legal It led to no discrimina
tion or Injury to any one. These tariffs have
been corrected at Washington and would have
been corrected long ago had the matter been
called to my attention.
The so-called secret rate sheet is nothing
more nor less than a regular division sheet of
another road. The other circular was neces
sitated by the rates Included In the price of
coal and the price fluctuated. The price could
be learned only from the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company.

DISCUSSION OF SALARY
Measure Adopted Reducing
Pay of High Officers Who
Join the National Guard
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.âThe ap
pointment of Lieutenant General Nel
son A. Miles as inspector general of
the State of Massachusetts overshad
owed all other questions in the discus
sion of the army appropriation in the
House tQ-day.
The debate had proceeded leisurely
until Hull, ln charge of the bill, of
fered an amendment providing that re
tired officers above the grade of major
should not receive the full pay of their
grade when assigned to duty with the
militia of the several States. Many
members declared that the amendment
was directed especially at General
Miles. Hull insisted that he had no
such thought in mind, and argued that
the best results were obtained from
officers of the lower grades. He asserted
that not until the law was passed al
lowing Increased pay for officers as
signed to the militia did retired officers
of higher grades apply for the appoint
ments. He said it was such Increased
pay and not patriotism which prompted
them, and he characterized their con
duct as unseemly.
The statement aroused Cockran of
New York.who declared that it was sim
ply penalizing superiors to the advan
tage and profit of inferior officers.
The measure was adopted.
A message from the President was
read In which he recommended the ap-
polntment ln the naval service of John
Henry La Fland, Earl W. Chaffee and
Joseph Drummond Little, midshipman,
dismissed from the Naval Academy for
hazing. The President says: A
Their severance from the academy, their re
duction to the foot of the claaa ot which they
were members and their entry Into the naval
service without formal graduation would be
adequate punishment.
BRODIE DUKE'S
GOLD AT STAKE
Relatives and Bride Begin
What Promises to Be
a Long Legal Battle
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 11.âBrodie L.
Duke's incarceration in a sanita
rium at Flushing, Long Island, has
Involved eight lawyers, representing
three interests, in what promises to be
a long legal wrangle. In addition to
these, two members of District Attor
ney Jerome's staff are paving the way
for criminal proceedings against those
who are believed to have made Duke
the victim of a conspiracy.
By permission of the State Lunacy
Commission. Duke was to have been
removed to-day from the sanitarium
to the asylum at Amityville. This
transfer was prevented by the serving
of a writ of habeas corpus Issued by
Judge Gaynor, which calls for the pro
duction of Duke before Judge Gaynor
at 10 o'clock on Thursday morning.
This was the first step taken ln the
legal battle by the opponents of the
Duke family. The writ was issued on
the theory that Duke is sane and capa
ble of taking care of his personal af
fairs. Alice Webb Powell Duke, the
bride, is still in hiding.
This action was taken before Judge
Gaynor in Brooklyn simultaneously
with a counter move on the part of
Nicoll, Arnable & Lindsay, represent
ing Duke's family, who were obtaining
Judge Greenbaum's signature to an or
der in the Supreme Court in Manhat
tan. This order was returnable on Jan
uary 20 and called for the appointment
of a committee for the care of the per
son and property of Duke. In the ap
plication for this order it waa alleged
that Duke was an habitual drunkard
and was insane and absolutely Incom
petent to manage or take care of his
property.
Duke at one time was considered to
be worth anywhere from three to five
million dollars. His estate now is be
lieved to be worth about $250,000.
â¢ Members of the Duke family were in
consultation with Delancy Nicoll near
ly all afternoon. They are determined
to annul the marriage of Duke to Alice
Webb ln the first instance; to have a
committee appointed for the care of
their relative, and to do all that lies
within their power to prosecute those
i who. they believe, took part in the
| conspiracy to get possession of Duke's
| estate.

St. Louis brewers had given $21,000 to
Thomas K. Niedringhaus, chairman of

ST. LOUIS. Jan. 11.âR C. Kerens,
formerly member of the National Re

who failed to win the Republican cau
cus nomination for United States Sena
tor to succeed Francis M. Cockrell,
made a statement to-day as to the ac
tion of the Legislature looking to the
investigation of the campaign contri
butions of Thomas K. Neidrlnghaus.
the successful candidate. Kerens said:
"I would not accept the office of
Senator with the slightest taint upon
its title. A United States Senatorship
tarnished, if secured by the promise of
Federal or State offices or other dis
reputable considerations, would be a
blight upon Its owner that would de
stroy his usefulness to the State, the
people and the party to which the re
cipient belongs. Therefore, it should
be assumed the friends of Mr. Neid
rlnghaus in the Legislature will place
no obstacle ln the way of the fullest
inquiry into the many rumors current
and published, Involving improper
methods."

NEW OFFICERS ELECTED YESTERDAY BY THE FIRE UNDERWRITERS'
ASSOCIATION OF THE PACIFIC, WHOSE ANNUAL MEETING CLOSED
LAST NIGHT WITH A BANQUET AT THE PALACE HOTEL.
The Fire Underwriters' Association
of the Pacific yesterday elected
officers for the year, read and de
bated papers of especial Interest to
underwriters, laughed at the funny
contents of "The Knapsack" as re
vealed by George F. Grant and feasted.
The matter of "leading importance"
that was referred to in the annual
address of President Fuller, the es
tablishment of insurance institutes
and the gradual combining of Ameri
can insurance organizations Into a fed
eration, was reported back by a com
mittee with a recommendation that a
special committee beappointed to take
up the subject and report to the
underwriters at their next annual con
vention.
In addition to this it was voted to
provide a salary for an assistant sec
retary and librarian, that the valu
able reference library that has been
created may be made available for the
instruction and benefit of the mem
bers. It was voted that the co-opera
tion of the University of California,
fnd particularly of the professors con
nected with the College of Commerce,
would be heartily welcomed. Author
ity was given for the publication of
pamphlets embodying papers of spe
cial interest to the underwriters. These
matters were reported favorably by
the committee to consider the presi
dent's report. The underwriters as a
body approved of the recommenda
tions.
AN INSURANCE INSTITUTE.
Mr. Folger. chairman of the com
mittee, explained, referring to' the pro
posed establishment of an insurance
institute for the instruction of the
underwriters of the Pacific Coast, that
while no definite plan could be at once
suggested, it would be advisable to
correspond with existing institutes and
insurance organizations and to request
co-operation on the part of the organ
ized underwriters of the United States.
Federation might follow the forma
tion of institutes. There is no under
writers' institute in the United States
and in this direction the Pacific Coast
takes the first step for the entire
country.
A suggestion was made by F. J.
Alex Mayer that much might be ac
complished in the education of under
writers through the agency of corre
spondence schools on the subject of
fire insurance in all its branches.
This will be considered by the execu
tive committee.
By the annual election the presi
dency of the association went to the
Northwest. A. W. Thornton of Se
attle, the vice president during the
past year, was advanced according to
the custom of the association and was
made president. F. B. Kellam was
elected vice president and Calvert
Meade was again re-elected secretary
and treasurer. The new excutive com
mittee includes in its membership
President A. W. Thornton, J. L. Ful
ler, Whitney Palaehe, W. H. Gibbons
and George W. Dornln. The old
library committee, consisting of W. H.
Lowden. Herbert Folger and B. J.
Smith, was re-elected.
Technical papers that were read
yesterday occupied the greater part of
the time. James C. Cunningham

treated the subject of the relations of
the special agent to the local agent.
Amos Sewell discussed building losses
for beginners. F. B. Kellam spoke
about the insurable interest of a ,
bailee. Guy Francis-read a paper con- j
corning the uses of co-insurance and
Professor A. \V., Whitney of the Unl- j
versity of California spoke at length
on the theory of lines of Insurance. i

COURT REFUSES
FURTHER DELAY
Attorney Countryman Asksj
Time to Secure Witness
Detained at Sacramento
WYMAN DEFENSE OPENS >
. |
Counsel Begs That Jury Be
Instructed to Acquit the;
Accused Ballot Stutfer
*
With the completion of Handwriting
Expert Kytka's testimony the prosecu
tion in the case of Charles Wyman, ac
cused of fraudulent voting, rested its
case. Attorney Countryman, acting for
the accused, was up in an instant with
a motion to Instruct the jury to acquit
on the ground that there was no pen
alty provided for the offense of imper
sonating a voter. Then he sought to
have the case postponed. Countryman
dilated on the expense and trouble
that the case would cause the State.
He declared that the person who
framed the law regarding purity of
elections did not intend to make an of
fense such as Wyman is charged with
a crime.
"Do you think that the Legislature
intended to make a person who imper
sonates a voter immune from punish
ment?" was asked by the prosecution.
"I do," replied Countryman. j
Ju/lge Lawlor said firmly. "The mo
tion is denied."
The next move made by Wyman's at-'
torney was to try for a postponement.
Assemblyman Thomas K. Atkinson,
Countryman declared, was an indispen
sable witness for the defense. He had
telegraphed to Sacramento for Atkin
son to be present yesterday, but the'
Assemblyman replied that he was un
able to come.
Judge Lawlor ordered that Country
man be sworn. The attorney was asked
if he had not stated that he was ready
to proceed when the case was called.
Countryman admitted that he had said
that he was ready. "But," added Wy
man's attorney, "at the time I had an
understanding with Mr. Maestretti
that Atkinson would be on hand when
we needed him."
Countryman asked that a postpone
ment be granted until January 14. By
that time, he thought, the missing wit
ness would be able to attend. The mo
tion was denied. Countryman said that
Atkinson was wanted to prove an alibi
for Wyman.
John Dowd. a janitor employed in the
Hall of Justice, was called by the de
fense. He testified that Special Police
man Joseph P. Doyle had confided ln
him to this effect: "They were hound
ing me. Tou can't fool those mer
chants."
Policeman Fairweather seemed to
have a defective memory. He testified
that he had remarked openly in the
Police Court at the preliminary hearing
of Wyman, "I am surprised to hear
Doyle give such testimony."
m cross-examination his memory be
came even more defective. He was in
troduced by the defense to contradict
the evidence given by Doyle. .
The afternoon session closed early, as
one of the Jurors was subpenaed as a
witness in the Monnier case. The trial
will be resumed at 9:30 o'clock this
morning.
CONTESTANT'S SIDE OF THE
TAYLOR LAWSUIT ENDED
Witnesses Declare That Testator Was
of Unsound Mind When He
Made Wttt
The contestant's side of the case of
Lizzie Taylor McÃride, who seeks to
revoke the probate of the will of her
half-brother. J. D. Taylor, was con
cluded in Judge Troutt's court yester
day afternoon, and a motion by the
proponents to dismiss the action was
denied. The hearing of the other side
will begin this morning.
Ella H. Talbot, in whose house Tay
lo' was a lodger, and who signed his
will had testified when the document
| was' admitted to probate that Taylor
(was of sound mind. Yesterday she
i said she had thought the matter over
land concluded that he was incom
petent. She drafted the will for the
old man, and when he signed it he
was not able to speak. Her husband,
William H. Talbott, described graphi
! cany the weakened physical and men
! tal condition of Taylor when the will
I was made, three days before his
death. The aged man was unable to
' talk and was so weak that the pen
i slipped from his fingers while he was
i signing the paper which disposed of
hi* estate to other relatives to the ex
clusion of the contestant. Other wit
nesses were Lena Kester, Sallie Wil
son and Maud Moore, all of whom
saw Taylor in his last sickness and ob
served his condition. They thought
him Incompetent.
BANKS RENEW BATTLE
OVER RAISED CHECK
New Trial of Suit for Payment of
Money Lost by Becker's Clever
Crime.
An echo of the sensation of nine
years agoâthe $22,000 raised check
of the Becker-Dean-Creegan gangâ
was heard yesterday In Judge Sea
well's court, to whom the supreme tri
bunal remanded for retrial the case
of the Crocker-Woolworth Bank
against the Nevada Bank for the re
covery of the money paid out on the,
bogus paper. In the former trial
Judgment for the plaintiff bank was
given for $25,177 48, which represent
ed the difference between the original
$11 check on the Bank of Woodland
and the slip which the Nevada Bank
cashed for the penmen and in turn
collected from the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank, with interest added.
The retrial consists in the reading
of the transcript of the testimony for
merly taken to certain passages of
which objections are being offered by
both sides, with some success. D. M.
Delmaa and T. t Bergin are repre
senting the Nevada Bank and the in
terests of the other institution are
looked after by W. S. Wood, John
Garber and Peter F. Dunne. The
famous check, in a glass frame, is the
carefully guarded exhibit in the case.

REGISTRAR MUST
FACE THE TEST
Election Commissioners De-j
fend Themselves Against
Charge of Irregularities
MADE NO SELECTIONS
Investigation by City's
Chief Executive Will Be
Surely Held on Saturday!
â¦
Inquiry was made yesterday of the
Election Commissioners as to whether
a possible indictment by the Grand
Jury on alleged charges of irregulari
ties in the appointment of precinct |
election officers would affect* the pro
posed investigation of the accusation
by the Mayor next Saturday morning.
The reply was made that an indictment
would make no difference, as the in
quiry' would be proceeded with and a
defense put in. Asked as to what the
defense would be, the Commissioners
stated that a reply had been prepared
which would be filed with the Mayor*
just previous to the beginning of his
investigation. The board made a gen
eral denial of the charges, and in it the
Commissioners plead not guilty there
of. It saddles Registrar Adams and
his deputies with the responsibility of
selecting the election officers, and is in
part as follows:
DO NOT ADMIT CHARGE.
That as to the charge ln said accusation
that twelve of said primary election precinct
officers therein named were all members of
the same political party, these defendants, r.ot
admitting such charge, say: That defendants
had no knowledge at the time of said ap
pointment that they were not' of different po
litical pai:fes as required by law; that
said defendants, and the Kcg'strar of Voters,
acting upon written applications, as afore
said, and the informations relied upon la the
Usual practice and course of business in t on
nectlrtl therewith, in good faith believed the
said persons at the time of their appoint
ment to be of different political parties, as
required by law; that said appointments were
published In a dally newspaper, as required by
law. in said city and county, and the members
of the county committees of the political par
ties who were interested in having equal rep
resentation on said precinct boards never in
formed said R'pistrar or the defendants that
said officers were not of the political parties
named in such publication. whl<di stated the
reputed politics of each appointee, as required
b} law, nor did any person ever make any
corrplalnt of that nature or at all prior l>
&a id election.
As to the charge that said twelve persons
were not upon the last assessment list, these
defendants, not admitting the same, say: That
the office of the said Board of Election Com
misslrm rs is not and has not been provided
with a copy of the assessment list or taxpay
ers of said city and county; that the said
list is made up, If at all. annually by the
Assessor of said city and county, and consists
of about SO,O(K< names of persons thereon,
and is only to be found in thr office of the
Assessor of said city and county, and is con
tained therein in mere than seventy volumes
in use in the tax department.
LEFT TO REGISTRAR.
As to the charge that five of said election
officers in said charges mentioned had not
been registered In the prerlnet where they
served for thirty days prior to the said elec
tion these defendants say that if It be a.
fact that such was the case that the number
so disqualified In such respect amount to less
than one ln one hundred of the number ol
precinct election officers appointed for said
election and less than one in five hundred of
th'- number who made application for such
appointment; and that such matter was neces
sarily left to the Registrar of Voters for ex
amination in the usual course of the conduct
and practice of the said election commission.
That in the year J904 there was a new
registration in said city and county and that
the registration for said primary election
amounted to over fifty thousand voters, and
that the task of comparing said application*
with the registration was very great and
arduous as a duty upon said Registrar of
Voters and he was compelled to rely upen
deputies and clerks in his employ; and the
defendants are Informed and believe that such
disqualification (if any there were) In regard
to said five persons was the result of an
oversight in the Investigations by clerks, made
and carried on In the office of said Registrar
of Voters, and that the action of said Regis
trar of Voters in the said matter waa ln good
faith; and these defendants had no knowl
edge or information of any such disqualifica
tion at the time of such appointments of such
election officers or rrior to such election.
As to the charge in said accusation that
three of tho raid precinct election offlaars were '
holding salaried positions under the municipal
government of the city and county cf San
Kranolseo, these defendants say: That it the
said fact was true, that these defendants had
ro knowledge thereof, and that there Is no
list kept.ln or furnished to the office cf the
said Board of Election Commissioners of the
employes of the said municipal government, or
In the departments thereof, and such matter
was not known to the Board of Election Com
missioners or any of the members thereof at
the time of said appointment or prior to said
election, and they are informed and believe
that the said fact did not come to the knowl
edge of said Registrar of Voters during the
period of his investigations) in regard to the
appointment cf said precinct election officers
or prior to said election. That the number
of minor employes in various departments Is
very large.
NO TIME TO VERIFY.
That upon the application blanks above men -
tioned, ln the Usual course of the proceedings
of the Board of Election Commissioners,
it not being a part of the duties of said board
and they not having the time personally to
verify the statements in said - applications;

and it having been the usual necessary and
1 roper practice of said board to leave the same
to the Registrar of Voters, and his deputies
and clerks under him. to see that precinct
election officers to be appointed were duly
qualified, ihe said matter was so necessarily
left to the said Registrar of Voters, who, with
the means at his command and the deputies
and clerks upcr. whom he relied, as defendants
are informed and believed, made all such in
vestigation ln good faith, as was required,
end calculated to. ln good faith, secure the se
lection and appointment of all said precinct
election officers having the qualifications re
quired by law, and that if any errors occurred
therein or any such appointees were disquali
fied, as set forth in the sail accusation, that
the'same was the result of mistakes or over
sight by the persons relied upon In the office
of the ReÃistrar of Voters, and such as might
occur under similar circumstances at any time
In good faith, without any Intention to appoint
any Â«is.iualifled person aa an election officer.
MADE IN GOOD FAITH.
Arid these defendants answer that the said
appointment of precinct election officers, as
made by them or by their authority for the
said prtmarv election, were all made in good
faith and without any knowledge or Informa
tion that any of the said precinct election
officers were in any manner disqualified for
any reason whatsoever and ln the belief that

GROWS HOTTER STILL
Morris Issues New Circular
â  ! _Â«
Sends Stockholders Details of
His Sensational! Charges.
OAKLAND, Jan. 11â H. C. Morris,
former cashier of the Central Bank,
and his father, H. S. Morris, are still |
hurling their broadsides at the man
agement of the bank in which they j
hold much stock. They are denouncing j
the management in circulars that they
mail to the stockholders.
The directors of the bank are still
standing by W. G. Palmanteer, at
whom these circulars are aimed, and
they express their confidence in his
ability and management. It is as
serted that Mr. Palmanteer and his
friends have more than enough votes
to continue them in control. President
Thomas Crellln says the charges have
all been investigated and dismissed by
the bank officials. Mr. Palmanteer re
fuses to discuss the matter. The last
circular runs in part thus: -
Tc the stockholders of Central Bank: As
I predicted in my former circular most ot tho
proxies obtained from you, ostensibly to revise
the by-laws of Central Bank, turned up in
the hands of one man and were used to dis
miss me from Die directorate at the special
meeting of December 22. There were a few
plain statements I wished to present fir your
consideration at that meet ing; ' but I was
dtnied the privilege of stating truths, that
you as stockholders should and shall hear.
Principally I wished to prefer the following
charge, that I had previously presented to
the board of directors. October 5, ISHM, with
the request that It be made part cf the min
utes:
"I herewith charge W. O. Palmanteer with
having forged the name of Frlederlka Blume
on a proxy for one hundred shares of Central
Bank stock standing in her name, and with

CATTLEMEN BAR
THE RAILROADS
Decide to Give Them No Part
in the National Livestock
Association as Replanned
DENVER, Jan. 11.âThe reorganiza
tion plan of President Frank J. Hagg
barth, by which the National Live
Stock Association was to be remodeled
and its control vested in a board com
posed of representatives of the trades
and interests-allied ln the raising of
live stock, has been torn to pieces so
far as the railroads are concerned. For
two days an executive committee com
posed of three representatives of each
industry has been working on the pro
posed reorganization plan, and it will
require at least one day more to finish
its work. No report will be made to
the convention before Friday morning.
Before it was definitely concluded to
prevent the railroads from acquiring
membership in the association a bitter
fight was waged In the committee
room. The Texas and Colorado cattle
men became wrought up over the pos
sibility of the railroads having a voice
ln the management of the live stock
association had announced their inten
tion of withdrawing from the associa
tion if the measure was carried. Other
Western organizations gave evidence of
a desire to take similar action.
There was a lively debate over the
packers, but it was Anally decided to
admit them into the association. All
the other branches of the livestock in
dustry will also be allowed to have
representatives in the reorganization.
Only the railroads remain outside.
S. H. Cowan of Fort Worth, Tex.,
spoke on the transportation question.
The vital defect with the interstate
commerce laws, he declared, was that
the Commissioners lacked the power to
enforce their decrees. He favored
speedy action by Congress empowering
the Commissioners to make their or
ders binding upon the railroads and
upon the shippers.
At the conclusion of Mr. Cowan's
address the convention adjourned until
to-morrow morning, when It is expected
that the committee on organization will
report to the convention.

vote said forged proxy at the stockholders'
meeting of Central Bank, held in. March, 1904.
I herewith most respectfully ask that a com
mittee ot live director? be appointed to in
vestigate this charge of forgery. I further
more ask this- committee .-to investigate the
cc of the proxy for 295 shares of
stock standing in the name of Claire Curtis
Huxley and voted by W. G. Palmanteer
prcxy at the above mentioned meeting, and
also to investigate Palmanteer's statement that
thtre was an old proxy somewhere around
that Mr. Yates had."
Since that date I have collected more evi
dence of these forgeries and now liave state
ments signed by both Mrs. Blume of San
Pablo and Miss Huxley of Paris, France.
The circular quotes In full the letters
from the persons named, corroborat
ing Morris' allegations regarding the
proxies. Morris demands that Cashier
Blake be compelled to produce from
the archives of the bank what he
terms the evidence of Palmanteer's
forgery- Continuing, Morris sayÃ:
No attention whatever ssas paid to these
charges. Apparently an effort is being made
to suppress: these facts and stifle investiga
tion. Why any one should assume this atti
tude of shielding the forger and preventing
investigation of unlawful acts of such gravity
and magnitude is inexplicable. If Palmanteer
is guilty he should be dismissed from the
service of the bank and punished. If he is
innocent he should invite the fullest and most
searching Investigation. Surely his present
attitude of suppression Is not calculated to In
spire confidence in his innocence. Turn on the
light. There is no middle ground for an hon
orable man to take in this matter.
I now urge upon every stockholder of this
bank the necessity of attending ln person the
annual meeting. You have the power; will you
assert it and take such action as you think
wise and best for the future welfare of tha
Central Bank? H. C. MORRIS.

In His Message Sent to the
Legislature He Favors a
Commission for Purpose
OLYMPIA, Wash., Jan. 11.âBefore a
Joint session of the two branches of the
State Legislature held in the hall of
the House and before a throng of spec
tators and State dignitaries, Governor
Henry McÃride to-day read his retiring
message, and Governor Albert E Mead
took the oath of office and read his in
augural address and first message.
The Inaugural ceremony was very
brief. A simple oath office was ad
ministered by Chief 'Justice Wallace
Mount of the Supreme Court, and Gov
ernor Mead immediately began the
reading of his inaugural address.
In his message to the Legislature
Governor Mead recommends the estab
lishment of a State Railway Commis
sion and favors the adoption of meas
ures, whereby the Legislature by a
two-thirds vote may submit any bill
under consideration by that body to
the Judgment of the Supreme Court to
determine its validity. He recommends
the enactment of legislation to prevent
the acquisition and indefinite holding
of large tracts of State timber lands to
the exclusion and prejudice of small
mill owners; the passage of an anti
pass bill and the enactment of a law
providing for the appointment of a
commission with power to determine
and assess the value of corporate prop
erty.
UTAH SELECTS
NEW SENATOR
George Sutherland Will Be
Sent to Washington From
the State of the Mormons
SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 11.âAt a
joint caucus of the Republicans of the
two houses of the Legislature to-night
George Sutherland was nominated
unanimously for United States Senator,
to succeed Thomas Kearns. As there
are only six Democrats in the Legisla
ture the nomination is equivalent to an
election. The houses will vote separate
ly next Tuesday.
George Sutherland was born in Buck
ingham, England, in 1862. At the age of
2 years he came with his parents to
Utah, where his father engaged in
trade and mining. After completing
his course at Brigham Young College,
Logan, Utah, he studied law at the
University of Michigan, where he grad
uated in 1883. He returned to Utah and
began the practice of law at Provo.
When Utah entered the Union Suth
erland was elected to the State Senate,
and in 1900 was elected to Congress,
where he served one term in the House
of Representatives. He declined a re
nomination in 1902.
Sutherland was married in 1883 to
Rosamond Lee, daughter of John Per
cival Lee. While not a member of the
Mormon church, Sutherland received
the support of the Mormon members of
the Legislature.
KEEPS COIN HE COLLECTED
TO DEFEND MAN'S LIFE
Sailor Fails to Turn in Money Gath
ered to Help Seaman Accused
of Murder.
HONOLULU, Jan. I.âLocal naval
circles are perturbed over the com
ing trial of N Master at Arms Geneau
of the United Btates gunboat Wheel
ing for the murder of the negro prize
fighter, Ulysses Harris, in June last.
A feature of the case is that one of
the crew of the United States steam
ship Solace, when in port here, was
asked to see what could be done to
ward getting together a fund for the
defense of Geneau. He succeeded in
gathering more than a hundred dol
lars, but* never turned over the money,
and the unfortunate sailor is left here
ln Honolulu to face a trial for his life
practically without funds. The action
of the man on the Solace has been
reported to Captain Lyons, command
ant of the naval station, and he has
cabled to Guam to see what can be
done when the ship arrives there.
The Secretary of the Navy has been
communicated with in order to get
the attendance at the trial of Lieu
tenant Coontz, who was executive of
ficer of the Wheeling at the time of
the killing of Harris and who is now
navigating officer of the Buffalo.
CATAMOUNT ATTACKS STOCK
TRAIN ON ERIE RAILROAD
Hungry Beast Attempts to Get at a
* Carload of Sheep During
Halt.
PORT JERVIS, N. V., Jan. 11.âAn
east-bound stock train on the Dela
ware division of the Erie Railroad
last night stopped to cool hot jour
nals. The train was transporting cat
tle and sheep. No sooner had it come
to a hart than the crew was startled
by the piercing cries of a wild animal
in the woods and a moment later a
huge catamount came bounding out of
the bushes and made direct for a car
of sheep.
The animal sprang rapidly against
the side of the car, sniffing and snarl
ing in its vain attempt to get at the
live stock. Then it crawled under the
trucks, causing great commotion
among the frightened sheep, whose
blratinga were loud and incessant.
fhe catamount lingered about the
train until it was well under way and
finally, with a snarl of baffled fury, re
treated to its lair.

WEDS JOSIAH HOWELL
BRILLIANT CEREMONY AT TRIMITY CHURC
A fair bride was Miss Gertrude Dut
tou as she plighted her love last nisht
to Josiah Howell, the well-known club
man.
Fair, too, was her troupe of attend
ants, gowned In chiffon c'.oth of the
pink of a pale rosebud.
At half-after-eight, the organ at
Trinity announced the coming of the
bride. Beautiful in all truth was she,
robed ln her nuptial gown nf cream
Spanish lace over chiffon, with a bil
low of fluffy flounces at her feet. Her
veil of tulle fell from a spray of orange
blossoms, and on her arm she bore a
shower bouquet of lllles-of-the-val!ey.
The bride, on the arm of her father,
William J. Dutton, was preceded to the
sanctuary by Miss Moliie Dutton. her
maid of honor, who was smartly
gowned in white chiffon cloth over pink
silk, and carried bridesmaid roses.
Then followed the four fascinating
maidsâMiss Maylita Pease, Miss Belle
Karmes, Miss Edna Middleton and
Miss Pearl Landersâall gowned alike
in pale pink chiffon cloth frocks, and
bearing bridesmaid roses.
The groom was attended by Thomas
Barbour, while Edward M. Greenvvay,
Enrique Grau, Harry Dutton and Linrl
say Scrulton made a picturesque group
.of ushers.
The service was performed by Dr.
â¢Clampett, according to the impressive
ritual of the Episcopal church.
Soon after the ceremony, which was
witnessed by about 400 guests, the
bridal party and about 100 friends and
relatives drove to the home of the
bride on Pacific avenue, where a smart
reception was held.
At the supper table of the bridal
party were seated Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Dutton, Mr. and Mrs. Grayson Dutton,
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Janes.
After a post-nuptial tripâwhither no
one knowsâMr. Howell and his bride
will occupy apartments at the An
toinette.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preferring; Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans
ing puroose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present ln
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im
proves the complexion. It whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
"Willow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather In
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is, that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "1 ad
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stom
. ach and bowels, and to clear the com
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited hy the daily use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal In Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

ORDERS RETURN
OF LAND MONEY
Department of the Interior
Benders a Very Important
Decision in Xevills' Case
A decision recently rendered by the
Secretary of the Interior at Washing
ton reached this city yesterday and
will be of great interest to purchasers
of Government land throughout the
country. In effect the decision orders
the return of purchase money paid for
land that has been confiscated by the
Government where it can be proven
that the purchaser acted ln good faith.
Millions of dollars that have been tied
up in Washington for the past twenty
flve years are likely to be returned to
claimants.
Government land is divided into three
classes âmineral, timber and agricul
tural. In attempting to secure this
land the prospective purchaser must
state specifically what character of
land he is taking up and must use it
for such. Should he make an entry on
timber land and It were afterward dis
covered that the property was more
valuable as mineral land his entry
would be canceled and the deposit
money forfeited. Injustice has been
done to many people ln this way, be
cause they acted In good faith at the
time they acquired the land and were
Ignorant of its properties. Nevertheless
the Government had driven them from
the land and retained their purchase
money.
Demand has been made many times
on the General Land Office at Wash
ington for the return of the money,
but the officials connected with that
institution claimed that they had no
right to do so. Affairs have run along
in this manner for the past twenty-five
years and there seemed to be no re
dress. Recently the law firm of McClel
lan & McClellan of this city made a de
mand for $232 97 paid by Captain W.
A. Nevills In Sacramento County dur
ing the year 1888. Nevills acquired the
land as timber land, but it afterward
transpired that It was rich in mineral
properties, and in 1890 his entry was
canceled. When the demand was re
fused by the General Land Office the
attorneys appealed the case to the Sec
retary of the Interior, and that official's
decision reached here yesterday. The
decision.states that inasmuch as Nevills
acted ln good faith the money should
be returned to him, and an order 'to
that effect was made. It Is expected
now that hundreds of other claimants
will take advantage of the decision and
press their claims.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. JANUARY 12, 1905.
JURORS BELIEVE
WOMAN IS SANE
Verdict That Mrs. BaltzelPs
Mind Is Sound Contrary
to Testimony of Experts
Eleven of the twelve members of the
I jury called in Judge Murasky's court
â  yesterday to pass upon the sanity of
i Mrs. Kate Baltzell decided that she
! was mentally competent, although two
j members of the Insanity Commission
â  who had her case under observation
! testified that she was Insane. Mrs.
I Baltzell was the only witness In her
\ own behalf.
The woman a few weeks ago went to
| the Grand Jury rooms with a grievance
and told Foreman Andrews that if she
did not get justice she would take the
law Into her own hands. Mr. Andrews
detained her for awhile and turned her
over to Drs. Lustig and Wadsworth,
j who kept her in the detention ward of
the Emergency .Hospital for several
days. She demanded a jury trial and
had an hour's hearing. Both experts
declared that she was unbalanced and
was dominated by a delusion that she
was being defrauded and persecuted In
j connection with a patent obtained by
her many years ago. Her accusations
were directed against Attorney Powell,
who had assisted her in getting the pa
pers, and she named prominent men
who she said were against her.
W. J. Stone, a medical student, who
had known her for fifteen years, told
of a change ln her manner and of her
ideas of persecution, which led him to
believe that her mind was falling. She
was suspicious of her friends.
When Mrs. Baltzell took the stand
she answered every question rationally,
though she went Into interminable de
tails. She produced her patent papers
for her invention of a bandage to as
sist the knitting of wounds in surgical
cases. She admitted that she told Fore
man Andrews that she would take "the
law into her own hands," but said she
only meant that she would do some
thing to herself to get arrested and
thereby bring her case before the pub
lic. "Why, I wouldn't harm a hair In
Mr. Powell's head," she said. "I would
not kill a fly If I could. I am a weak
woman and It would shock my nerves."
When the jury returned Its verdict
Mrs. Baltzell rushed forward and shook
the hand of each one, including that
of the man who dissented ln the opin
ion.

TUTORS OBJECT
TO PRINCIPAL
Twelve Teachers of James
Lick School Petition for
Transfer of Albert Lyser
MAKE APPEAL TO BOARD
â¦
Appear in a Body and Aver
That They Can No Longer
Continue Under His Sway
s
An extraordinary scene was enacted 1
yesterday in the asembly-room of the j
Board of* Education, when twelve j
teachers of the James Lick Grammar j
School appeared in a body and made a '
personal appeal to School Directors j
Roncovieri and Altmann that Albert
Lyser, their principal, be transferred
to seme other school.
j The gist of the complaint was that I
j the discipline of the school was becom- !
I ing demoralized as the result of the j
' overbearing tactics employed by Ly-1
â¢ ser, and that if he were not trans- â¢
; ferred applications for transfer would
Ibe filed by the twelve teachers them-
I selves, as they felt they could no long
â er continue under Lyser's sway. The
! delegation was headed by Miss Mary
! Boyle, and each teacher explained her â¢
grievance, and did not mince words in
the explanation. The teachers objected
to having been reported fair or good ln
discipline. Miss Boyle was the only one
to be marked excellent, but she joined
in the appeal to have Lyser transferred.
"Mr. Lyser is insulting ln his man
ner to us," said Miss J. C. Evans, fifth
grade teacher. "He has frequently told
us that we did not know how to teach.
He himself does not teach in the
classes and seldom gives illustrated
work to the pupils.'.'
"We are here to ask this board to
send us somebody else as principal,"
said Miss J. L. Murphy, seventh grade
teacher, "if you do not we will all be
taken down with nervous prostration.
What is the use of breaking up a school
for one person? Mr. Lyser has pro
nounced us all miserable failures, and
we resent his adverse criticisms."
"He insisted that we should have to
live up to his ideals," said Mrs. Hattie
B. Steele, seventh grade teacher. "I told
him that I might be able to do so, but
it would put me in my grave. I have
done my best."
"That is right." said Miss Boyle face
tiously, "you cooked him a chop and a
cup of tea every day, but he had no
chops to-day or yesterday."
Another teacher said that Lyser had
treated her outrageously by misrepre
sentation, having told her that she was
his best teacher yet marking her only
"good" in discipline.
"He expects long extracts from the
Declaration of Independence," said
Miss Boyle, "and has no use for gram
mar or arithmetic. The children are
unhappy and do not want to work, and
the teachers are discouraged. We can
not do our duty with Mr. Lyser as
principal, and yet we do not want to
leave the school."
"How many of you want Lyser trans
ferred?" asked Roncovleri.
"We all do," said tfie twelve teach
ers, rising to their feet. "If he stays
we all want, to be transferred."
Roncovleri said the petition for Ly
ser's transfer would have to be consid
ered by the full board, which will be
done at to-day's meeting.

THIRD WIFE GETS LETTERS
ON SECOND WIFE'S ESTATE
Mrs. Butler Smith Makes Another
Move In Behalf of Stepchildren
Who Are Heirs.
Another move, significant in its
bearing upon the impending contest
for the guardianship of the two chil
dren of the late Butler Smith, was
made yesterday by his widow. Emily
May Smith, who applied to Judge Mu
rasky for special letters of adminis
tration upon the estate of Ella Rob
erta Smith, mother of the children
and second wife of their father. Judge
Murasky granted the application upon
the showing of her attorney, Burrell
G. White, that the rents derived from
the real estate need immediate atten
tion. Included in the realty Is a
building on Kearny street, which has
been appraised at $82,000.
The widow already has special let
ters upon her husband's estate, which
is worth about $60,000 and increases
the fortune to which the children are
heirs. The 13-year-old daughter,
Genevieve, accompanied her step
mother to court and told the Judge
that she wanted Mrs. Smith to be her
guardian. There is a provision in the
law giving a child old enough to judge
the privilege to make this selection, i
It is expected that some
may-develop from Mrs. Ella Chamber
lain, mother of the deceased Mrs.
Smith, .who lives in the East. It is
rumored that the application of the
nurse. Mrs. Findlay. for letters of
guardianship may Ye in the grand
mother's interest. It will be contend
ed that the grandmother has shown
herself to be opposed to the rights of
the children by having contested the
provisions of her daughter's will in
which she was left an annuity.
Mrs. Smith's guardianship applica
tion has been transferred to Judge
Kerrigan's court and will be heard
to-day.

DISLIKE PLANS
FOR STRUCTURE
General Protest Against
Arrangement of Offices
in New Customs Building
Several letters of protest from brok
ers and others have been placed in pos
session of the Secretary of the Treas
ury, concerning the plans of Eames &
Young for the proposed Custom-house
to be erectea ln this city upon the site
H/t the present building. The most se
rious objections are made by customs
brokers and others having business at
that place. They say that there is a
crying need for the new Custom-house
because the business of the port has
largely outgrown the capacity of the
present establishment and that every
department in the building is over
crowded, but that an inspection of the
plans shows that in the new building
the congestion will be' Intensified in
stead of diminished.
Another complaint is that the new
plans contemplate the narrowing by
ten feet of the space between the Cus
tom-house building and the Appraisers*
building, which will not give drays suf
ficient space in which to turn around.
Under the new plans brokers and oth
ers will be required" to travel up and
down stairs and all over the building to
perform their duties, because the vari
ous offices, instead of being on one floor
as they are now, will be scattered on
different floors.
The proposed location of the United
States sub-treasury Is another serious
cause for objection. By actual scale
measurement on the plans, at least 1200
United States pensioners will be obliged
once a month to travel 280 feet by a
tortuous route to get to the sub-treas
ury from the street.
Some adverse criticisms have been
made against the exterior architectural
appearance of the proposed edifice. It
is said to resemble a large packing case
with holes for windows and doors
gouged into it. Senator Perkins and
his colleagues of the California delega
tion have been petitioned to use their
influence with the Treasury Depart
ment to cause the plans to be changed
to conform to the requirements of the
business.

matter, and that he would not, as he

Archbishop Riordan has appointed
the Rev. Father Edward P. Dempsey to
the pastorate of the Church of the Im
maculate Conception, Oakland, to suc
ceed the lamented and venerable pas
tor, the Rev. Father Michael King,
whose death occurred December 12 last.
The announcement of Father Demp

should have been conferred upon him.
Dempsey has acted as one of
the assistant priests at St. Mary's
Cathedral for some time, and his untir

those who came in close touch with
him.
He is a fluent speaker and of the
kindliest bearing. Father Dampsey

RUSSIA'S REASON FOR FIGHTING.
IMMEDIATELY after the fall of Port Arthur there was.a wide
spread feeling that peace would now be possible. With that
stronghold in the hands of Japan, and with the whole coast clear
beyond V ladivostok guarded by the fleets of Togo and Kamamura,
it is apparent that Russia must handle a military situation by land,
over 6000 miles of single track railway,, and that distance from her
base equalizes her resources with her smaller enetrn\
Japan did not hesitate in declaring that peace with future safety
would accord with her policy. This declaration was agreeable to
the rest of the world, and a sign from Russia has been anxiously
expected. But there is no sign. The enormous carnage in the East,
the pathetic sights at Port Arthur, the sorrow, suffering and death,
make no impression in the presence of a desire to repair the national
prestige. It was hoped that the splendid conduct of Great Britain
would appeal to Russia. The North Sea incident was an attack on
the prestige of the British empire. The nations expected that it
would lead to war. But Great Britain, with admirable self-control
and a spirit that is beyond praise, dismissed the issue of prestige
and ambition, and consented to peace by arbitration.
The analogy is not forced nor remote. If Russia had chosen
she could have indicated her respect for the "world's desire for peace
by proposing arbitration of the issues that are between her and
Japan. It would be no sacrifice of prestige to do so. Indeed, from
the point of view of the sober mind, her prestige would be increased
by such action. We believe the time is here when the nation that
submits a warlike challenge to peaceful adjustment by arbitration
will stand at the head of the nations, morally the greatest of them
all. But Russia puts aside the olive branch and turns the dove of
peace over to the pot hunter and insists upon recovering by arms
the prestige that she has lost by arms. The Russian press calls the
roll of sad and sore defeats and declares there can be no peace until
the score is evened by victory. Therefore the war is to go on. The
Russian logic is that every future defeat will make continuance of
war more necessary. It seems like a whim, a fantasy, but this logic
seems intended to throw upon Japan the responsibility for the
continuance of the war. If she would only cease whipping the Rus
sians they would make peace!
When the Czar called the first peace conference at The Hague
it was hailed as high evidence of Christian enlightenment, heralding
the end of war. The spirit believed to be expressed in that call was
complimented throughout the world. Had the Czar that spirit? Did
he desire peace? Was he sincere? These are the questions asked
everywhere now. If the Czar desired to establish peace on earth,
to end the sorrow and suffering, the poverty and national decadence
caused by war. he must have known that he could only impress this
desire upon the world by making a sacrifice. He has now the op
portunity to go into history as the greatest man who has ruled men.
If he desire to acquire prestige in which he will have no rival, he can
do it by proposing arbitration.
Japan is necessarily passive. Her war is defensive. She has
no ambitions for conquest and asks only the right to exist. She is
where England was when the invincible Armada sailed for her
coasts, and her existence was threatened by Philip 11. Then the
greatest empire on earth attacked a small and weak kingdom and
was defeated. The Czar can learn from that history that victory
is not always with the strong. He can be greater as a peacemaker
than as a warmaker. As the war goes on he is only increasing the
respect felt for his antagonist. Even the Kaiser decorates both Nogi
and Stoessel, an acknowledgment of equality of merit. If Russia
go on making war to recover prestige, .the world, now lacking in
sympathy for her, will not be lacking in enmity.
MATRIMONY IN KANSAS.
SINCE one of the legislators of Kansas introduced a bill for a
law making marriage a limited contract, with a tenure of ten
years, with a proviso that when that period is up the contract
is renewable.at the option of both parties, or they may divide the
property and the children and separate, with freedom to make a
new conjugal contract with somebody else, another legislator, per
haps moved by some unhappy conjugal experiences, has expressed
a desire to limit the contract to five years. Of course if the policy
of limitation be once adopted, there is no bar to a shorter period, and
many will prefer one year.
\\ hen the bill was first proposed it was regarded as a joke, but
it seems to be meant in all earnestness. Many say it will put an
end to divorce. This is not so. A divorce is the judicial dissolution
for cause of a marriage contract. The proposed law will establish
automatic divorce. It will make divorce practically universal. View
ed from the standpoint of morals and public policy, the law is a prac
tical dissolution of all family ties and an abolition of the home life.
It invites the exaggeration of petty differences and bickerings, and
makes unnecessary that exercise of patience, philosophy and mor
ality upon which the family relation depends. It degrades that re
lation to the level of the beasts that perish, and destroys the repose
and confidence and certainty so necessary in the right rearingÂ»of
children. ,
We doubt the capacity of a State to enforce such a law. All
contracts are judicially reviewable to test their conformity to good
conscience and public policy. These have dictated the permanency
of the marriage contract, making it dissoluble orriy for such reasons
as the divorce laws define as proper cause for its termination. We
cannot believe that a limited contract would be held by the courts as
of superior sanctity to those temporary and immoral relations which
courts have always frowned upon. The good of the state depends
upon the permanence and virtue of the domestic relations of hus
band and wife, parent and child. The evil of divorce is that it in
terrupts this permanency and makes temporary those relations which
are needful to the perfect home as the foundation of the perfect
state.
CALIFORNIAN OLIVE OIL.
IN a bulletin recently issued by the State Agricultural Experiment
Station at Berkeley G. W. Shaw, one of the station's staff, calls
attention to the wide possibilities yet remaining undeveloped in
the olive oil industry. With changing commercial conditions and
the introduction of more scientific methods in the process of oil
manufacture, a field* of activity which has heretofore been given
over to more or less spasmodic and insufficient effort now becomes
broad enough to attract the attention of the most progressive grow
ers and manufacturers in California.
According to Professor Shaw's word the olive oil industry has
undergone a change similar to that recently effected in dairying
interests. It is no longer the individual oil producer of small ca
pacity that has a chance in the market, but the work of manufacture
must be controlled by a central plant, located in reference to the
olive orchards as a creamery has relation to the dairy farms sup
plying it, and working either co-operatively with the growers or un
der private ownership. Under the old system of individual manu
facture by the growers themselves, done as it was on a small scale
only to fill a limited special demand, the quality of the general out
put was such that the competition of foreign and adulterated oils
could not be met. A uniform product and a strong home market
alone can justify olive oil manufacture in the State at the present
time.
The total importations of olive oil from Italy, France and the
other foreign centers of production for nine months ending March
31, 1963, aggregated $1,314,676; the California product for the same
time was of $150,000 value only. This is a strong market to oppose,
but in our State conditions for olive production and oil manufacture
are favorable enough to warrant a certain shifting of the balance in
our favor if only uniformity in manufacture and vigorous promotion
of the home product is inaugurated.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. JANUARY 12. 1905.
ALMS AND THE MAN
THE little old barrel organ wmnea
away monotonously, its squeaky
drone all but drowned in the roar
of traffic in the street. Its three tunes
followed one another in ceaseless suc
cession; the jerky strains of "After the
Ball" were supplanted by "The Last
Rose of Summer," and this in turn
cave way to "Lead, Kindly Light"âa
rendition which was unique in uneven
breaks and phthisicky wheezes due to
implications in the internal mechan
ism of the dilapidated affair.
Huddled on the bricks of the side
walk, his back resting against an iron
fence, an old man with a rusty gray
beard patiently ground the crank; in
the little tin cup beside the organ were
three pennies; and suspended from the
aid man's neck was a tin sign with the
time-Worn announcement, "I Am
Blind."
As Francesca West and young Hol
ander came down the street, the or
jan was in the throes of "Lead, Kind
y Light," and the spasmodic snarls
it sent out seemed somewhat in the
nature of a protest. Francesca caught
ike young man's arm, and they halted
!>efore the organ.
"Oh," she said under her breath,
'what a horrible old man!" And fish
ng a quarter from her purse, she
iropped it into the tin cup.
The old man touched his hat. grunt
'd a stereotyped "Thanks, mum." and
he hymn squeaked along Its uneven
vay. Hollander watched the pmceed
ng with a grim smile.
"The old humbug!" he commented as
:hey continued their way down the
rtreet.
"Why do you say that?" Francesca
isked.
"Well," said Hollander, "perhaps you
lotlced he suffixed his thanks' with
l 'mum' instead of a 'sir.' I was watch
ng closely and saw the old codger
:overtly open the eye nearest the cup.
Rest assured he saw the quarter and
ts donor as well as I did."
"Anyway," she said, "he earns the
>ittance he gets. Imagine sitting there
ill the morning grinding that organ
md listening to its drone, all for
hree pennies."
"Don't let the pennies deceive you,"
Hollander protested. "He puts the
dckels and dimes in his pockets. It
vould hurt business to have the tin
up look too prosperous. By this

FROM GIRL'S STANDPOINT PROPOSAL
MARKS THE BEGINNING OF COURTSHIP
DOROTHY FENIMORE
WHEN does courtship begin? Does
a young man commence to court
his affinity when he first meets
her. or when he recognizes her as his
affinity?
This Interesting question was raised
a few days ago in the English probate
and divorce court, when the validity of
a certain Scutch marriage was ques
tioned.
When the witness on the stand hesi
tated over her answer to fhe query,
"How long had your husband been
courting you when he proposed?" Sir
Francis Jeune, who was on the bench,
came to her rescue by the decision that
a man does not himself know when he
begins to court a girl.
Says Oliver Wendell Holmes, through
his "Autocrat" as mouthpiece: "The
court of nature assumes the law to be
that all men love all women; and the
individual man therefore is bound to
show cause why he does not love any
particular woman."
Now, if the Autocrat is right about it
the decisive moment which fixes a
man's fate is the one when his sponta
neous gallantry toward the other sex
changes into a readiness to state why
he does not love any woman on earth
except one. This would make real
courtship date from the proposal.
A distinction should be drawn be
tween gallantry and courtship. Every
pretty girl knows the difference be
tween the two. She has had dozens of
men who are willing to confess that
they prefer tandem to double harness,
tell her that she is adorable, that their
suffering hearts are beneath her danc
ing feet. But they are too generous by
far to be trusted.
They ask for nothing in return for
that picturesque self-abnegation which
THE AGENT DIDN'T KNOW.
ILLUSTRATING the frequent ignor

(true) story .is told by H. W. Lanier ln
January W T orld*s Work:
There are to-day some thousands of
varieties of life insurance policies,
each of which has a technical name
and Is capable of being made quite
unintelligible to the average man.
Some unscrupulous agents trade on
this; many do not really understand
the meaning of terms themselves, but
have learned their lesson, parrot-like;
and most of them apparently find it
unnecessary to describe in plain Eng
lish to those about to insure what they
are contracting for. The result is a
mass of misinformation and confusion
about the whole subject.
Injurious Effects of Smoke.
An interesting discussion has been
going on in Utah to determine the ef
fect of the smoke from smelters upon
crops, as many of the farmers near
Salt Lake City claim that they have
suffered damage by the injurious
fumes given off from such establish
ments. Inasmuch as the annual value
of agricultural products in Utah
amounts to $17,000,000, while the metal
lic output js practically twice as much,
it is of importance, says Harper's
Weekly, that conditions should be reg

"I'd hate to look at the world through

said. "I always give something to

"Allow me to take exception to that
statement." said the young man.

"There is one beggar in particular,"
said Hollander, "an honest beggar,

"Where Is this neglected beggar?"
she asked. "When have I seen him?"
"He has dogged your steps for the

For instance, an agent was trying
to insure an editor on some new plan.
The editor had a theory that any fact
could be put into plain every-day Eng

knew what he was talking about. After
listening to an involved flow of "pre
miums," "deferred dividends," "cash
surrender values," and "optional
choices," he said gravely:
"See here. I don't understand what
you're talking about. But til tell you
what I'll do. If you'll write that
proposition out in ordinary English,
so that an ordinary man can under
stand It, I'll not only take the policy,
but ill publish the explanation as an
article and pay you $100 for it."
"Will I? Sure, I will," exclaimed
the overjoyed agent, thinking he had
jured, either by direct effects or by
restrictive legislation.

asked. "Would I know he was a beg

"You would know he was a beggar
just to hear him." he returned.
"Is it money he begs?" she inquired
sweetly.
"No," he said, "it's not money he
wants. He has enough of that him

"And suppose I dropped some

he grind me a tune on a decrepit bar

"He'd give you life-long deyotion la

"Perhaps he's as big a humbug as

he's picked the metaphorical dimes

them in his pockets and only lets me

"He's a most persistent one," she
laughed.
"You say you give alms to every
ragged mendicant who crosses your

with palms and other greens, were
lavishly used in decoration. The bride,

bridal robe of ilne old mousseline and
rare lace. Beautiful in itself, the robe
was also an heirloom, having been
worn by three brides before this fair
one donned it. She carried lilies of
the valley. Miss Dorothy Chapman,
maid of honor; Miss Alice Eloesser,
Miss Jeanne Gallots, Miss Avis Sher

TIVOLI AUDIENCE.
Italian Opera Company Opens In "iupoletto"
For the first night of its first grand
Opera season the new Tivoli heaped up
history last night with all kinds of a
wonderful 'Rlgoletto.'' The audience
was as large as the house and almost
as Latin as the cast. It was as en
thusiastic and ready to say so as any
audience this side of Milan, and said so
mightily last night.
There were must reasons for en
thusiasm. There is a sopranoâbut of
Tettrazzini laterâand there Is a con
ductor that lives up to even the Mexi
can legends of his achievements.
Yesterday morning the company
walked into the Tlvoli after a little
4000-mile journey from Mexico. They
were washed out at Banning, almost
kidnaped by the music-loving Governor
of Chihuahuaâwho wanted them to
put us off for a day or two and sing
-a little tenor for himâand otherwise
happily beguiled on the way. Yester
<iay morning tired, dusty, with a hand
ful of orchestra, part of a chorus, the
scores somewhere, the costumes else
where, the principals and a conductor,
they arrived. It is owing to the fact
that the conductor was a Pollacco that
last night's performance was given at
all. Its kind also is due to the same
fact.
Signor Pollacco is a wonderful sort of
person. He has the fire of a Creatore
and the fineness of a Mancinelli. He
was all over the orchestra last night.
dartMsj: a rapier-like baton at the vio
lins, whipping in the brass, coaxing the
wood wind and compelling them all to
a quick, clean, close, sensitive ensem
ble that 1 do not remember to have
heard equaled before at the Tivoli. And
if Signor Pollacco can do this uith om
rehearsal with a number of men yet
musical stranger? to one another, what
.will he do in a few days? The scores
he Is evidently on the most musician ly
of terms with; he is apparently as lit
tle inclined to spare himself as Mas
ragni, and in the orchestra, both home
and imported, he has evidently the best
of material. There are to be fifty-two
men all told; last night's count was
forty-eight. One thing only the con
ductor has to learn âthat in shouting
as we did at the end of act three we did
not want an encore, but the privilege
of a stage view of Signor Pollacco âhis
back view is of the young and hand
some sort! However, the audience took
it out in applauding him between acts.
A little woman about the height and
something of the build of Sembrieh
is Tettrazzini. One had heard all sorts
â¢of wonderful things about her âand
feared things therefore. But the Tet
trazzini legends, as well as the Pollacco
legends, are all less than true. One is
almost afraid to own to the depth and
â¢character of the impression that the
. singer made. To me, however, the
voice has all the crystalline purity and
â¢ freshness of the Melba voice, while the
method of using it much more nearly
approaches that of Sembrichi Large
words these, but I believe them entirely
justified. The voice is flawless. It is
perfectly sweet, perfectly clear, per
fectly evenâup to a full E in alt âand
perfectly round. It runs as easily,
lightly as a lark's. There is a trill
that shames any lark I ever heard and
a stale even as a string of pearls. It
.is the purest bel canto. Just three
notes it took the audience to discover
what was before them In the way of
voice and the Tettraxzlnl cigar is as
good as labeled.
As before said, she is as good a
l ger as owner of a voice. Tettrazzlni
is further an actress of unusual abil
ity, though it is apparent that, like
her feeling is more for com
edy. Her <Jilda, however, was notable
for the sincerity and charm of the act
ing, the scene where, despoiled, the
Jester's daughter confesses her misfor
tune to her father in particular rising
to power.
Signor Romboli was the Rigoletto,
and the cast was happy in him both
from the dramatic and vocal stand
point. Signor Romboli has a bright,
powerful and resonant barytone that
he uses with ample freedom and con
viction. In the sustained notes one
gets a little too much tremolo occa
sionally, but otherwise the Romboli
method is entirely artistic The en
semble passages between the Jester and
his daughter were delightfully sympa
thetic, the duet in act 2 being rede
manded for this alone.
The Duke was essayed by Signor Ba
zelli. who, to a successful vocal
handling of the part, added an excep
tionally happy acting of It. He is a
distractingly handsome person, as the
matinee girls will say. and sings with
great spirit and dash. Bazelli's voice
lacks the pure tenor quality of say
Russo's. but is delightfully flexible,
resonant and powerful. It is rather of
the tenore robusto order. His "Da
Donna c Mobile" was given with all
essential deviltry. The following quar
tet, in which Signorina Bettini as
M; ddalena added a vivacious and col
orful contralto, came with even more
than its accustomed flavor. Signor
Cirotto .idds a Sparafuclle that looks
like Captain Kidd and that sings in a
handÂ«ome enough basso at need.
fl to the chorus, it is as good-look
ing as Mr. Grau's, but can sing, and
even takes the trouble to act. Its
' Zitti, Zitti," the whispered brigand's
< horus, was the best sung within my

RESIGN PLACES
Inspecting Physicians Han

Inspecting Physicians William J.
Walsh and J. B. Hannah have filed
their resignations with the Board of
Health. The resignations were pre
sented at last Mu-nday's meeting, but
nothing was done pending an effort
which will be made to have the two
physicians reconsider their determina
tion to sever their connection with the
Health Department, but they are be
coming tired of working for the city
without pay. When they were first
appointed last January an Injunction
to prevent the payment of their sala
ries and those of- other subordinates
was dissolved. They then received sal
ary for about two months. Another In
junction was obtained and the inspec
tors have not received any salary for
nine months.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', THURSDAY, JANUARY 12, 1905.
PURLOINED
GEMS ARE
RECOVERED
Fortune in Jewels
Found Buried in
a Jar.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 11.âBuried in a
glass jar, under a few inches of earth,
gems and Jewelry worth more than
$25,000, stolen from the Albert Corning
Clarke estate offices in Cooperstown,
N. V., last July, and the property of
Mrs. F. Ambrose Clarke, have been re
covered by a Pinkerton detective
agency.
William Coleman, the man arrested
for the theft, is sixty years of age, has
a criminal record extending from 1869
and is known as one of the boldest
thieves ln the country.
Heirlooms of the Clarke family, most
of them wedding presents to Mrs.
Clarke from her husband or his moth
er, who is now wife of Bishop Henry
C. Potter, the stolen gems are priceless
in the eyes of Mrs. Clarke and her hus
band's family.
Buried only a few inches below tha
surface and not five feet from a side
walk along which thousands of per
sons passed every day. this fortune in
precious stones has lain since last
July.
Before Mrs. Potter's marriage she
was the widow of Alfred Corning
Clarke, who left an immense fortune
and a beautiful country place at Coop
erstown, called Fernleigh. This estate
is surrounded by a large park, which
Mr. Potter presented to the village sev
eral years ago. At one of the park
gates is a low marble building, which is
used as the offices of the Clarke es
tate. It has vaults, safes and the usual
furniture of a bank. From'this office
the Jewels were taken while the clerks
were at luncheon.

PHOENIX, A. T., Jan. 11.â"Light
rain has continued to fall at intervals
to-day. adding to the already flooded
condition of the country. Last night
an area, five miles square, northwest
of Phoenix, was under water from six
i inches to two feet, and in places water
is still standing. This overflow was
mainly caused by a freshet from Cave
Creek, which comes from the mountain
and sinks into the desert above Glen
dale. Considerable damage has been
done to farm crops and irrigation
ditches through broken banks.
One end of the flood crossed the west
side of *Phoenix, surrounding many
houses with water, but doing little
damage, excepting to a colony of in
valids who lived in tents In the
suburbs, and who had to be carried
from their beds which were surrounded
by water. Some of them are very ill.

W. B. Kennedy. Arrested in Benicia,
Alleged to Be Slayer of the

WOODLAND, Jan. 11. âThe local
police declare that W. B. Kennedy,
who was arrested at Benicia and
t barged with burglaries committed at
Dunnigan. in this county, is the Ken
nedy who was accused in San Fran
cisco of muredering Policeman Robin
son. The police say that he served
a sentence of thirty days ln the Sac
ramento Jail and allege that on the
night of January 6, with three accom
plices, he blew open two safes and
robbed two stores, the postofflce and
thf Wells-Fargo office at Dunnigan,
getting about $200.
Kennedy and his companion, named
McDonald, were arrested at Benicia.
Two other men declared to be acces

Captain of Detectives Burnett said

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO. Jan. 11.âA movement
to colonize a tract of land and form
a new town has been starred by mem
bers of the faculty of Stanford Uni
versity. The site purchased is the
Bellview tract, three miles north of
the campus in the foothills. Those
at the head of the project are Profes
sors W. R. Dudley, R. E. Allardice,
H. W. Rolfe, D. H. Campbell and W.
G. Dodge.
It is announced that the land will
at once be subdivided and building
operations begun, and it is assumed
that none but college people will be
encouraged to become residents.
The conditions on the campus pre
clude the sale of the land and those
who build there do so under lease at
a rather high rental. This has been
found unsatisfactory and while many
professors own homes on the campus
many others have built in Palo Alto
and adjacent places. Naturally the
professors desire to invest where they
can share in the steady increase in
realty values, hence the new project,
What view the Stanford trustees and
Manager Lathrop will take of the mat
ter is causing much surmise, as it will
tend to divert residents from the
campus and make property there less
valuable.

BY ASSHETON SMYTH.
PpeclaJ Dispatch to The Call-
RAXERSFLELD, Jan. 11.âThe Pa
Â«lfLc Coast Field Trials Derby for 1905
is at last a matter of history, having
*een won to-day by Ladylike, owned
by J- E. Terry of Sacramento. W. W.
Tan Arsdale's Mariposa was placed
aecond. Both proved sporting dogs of
â¢ .the highest quality and it seemed a
pity a loser had to be named, as re
quired by the rules, each having done
auch clever work.
Ladylike Is a lemon-white English
Better by Orion-Terry's Lady. Both
sire and dam were field trial winners.
Lady especially being a high class set
tor, which character she has transmlt
! . lt d in a marked degree to her daugh
ter.
Mariposa is a black, white and tan
English setter of good site and true
English type, having already won a
blue ribbon on the bench in the puppy
class. He is of such confirmation as to
m.ike him both a handsome and an
easy mover. He should be what sports
men call an "all day" dog. He is by
Detroit Joe, out of Countess Mark.
While neither of these has been a field
trial winner, they come from strains
which have made the highest records.
Third prize was divided by Rose &
Obristenson's English setter Del Rey
Lelle and J. E. Lucas' pointer Chiquile.
FIRST RACE EVEN CP.
Tho usual large gathering of spec
* tators followed the dogs throughout
the day, watching Intently every move
made in the field. There is a charm
ing absence of commercialism about
the affair. No wagers of any descrip
tion are made and no comments are
b<*ard as to the money the different
dogs will win. It is sport for sport's
-sake and materialism plays no part in
iho affair.
The first brace waa put down this
morning at 9:12 and consisted of Del
'Rey Belle and Burbank. the latter
opened proceedings by running through
a covey and flushing it without pay
ing any attention to the birds, but
.working over it, where they scattered.
He made three good points, Del Rey
' Belle scoring the same number. Neither
dog maintained the good form shown
in the first heats. This was probably
caused by the fact that they are ken
>nel mates which caused them to run as
" a couple instead of working independ
ently. Toward the end of the heat Del
Rey Belle did some excellent work.
On account of one of the Derby dogs
being absent, four braces of the "all
age stake" were run off before the
Derby was resumed. When the Derby
â was taken up again, the final was a
brace of pointers, Japan and Chiquite.
The latter at once laid out the work
for the big pointer, setting a pace en
tirely too hot for him and doing clean
point work. Japan was, in the par
lance of the handlers, "off his nose,"
which meant his power of scent was
' lacking for the time being. This was
show n by his constant hesitation and
uncertainty in locating and pointing his
birds. At the conclusion of ttys heat.
Judge Bettner announced the winners
as is told in the foregoing.
JUDGE'S DECISION CLOSE.
It was considered by the experienced
men present that a decision giving
either Ladylike or Mariposa first would
have been just, as they were so evenly
matched. The division of third money
between Chiquite and Del Rey Belle
was also generally approved.
The first brace in the "all age" was
J. E. Terry's Kilgarif, black, white
and tan English setter, handled by W.
B. Coutts, and W. W. Van Arsdale's
black, white and tan English setter
Keepsake, handled by Charles H. Bab
rork. Here was a case where the ex
tremes, met, Kilgarif being one of the
largest of the English setters, while
Keepsake is characterized as a pocket
edition of the breed, weighing about
Â£fi pounds.
Notwithstanding the disparity in size
there was but little difference in the*
high quality of their work. Both proved
wide rangers, looking in likely places
for their birds. They were stanch
and snappy on these points and true
backers. In speed at the beginning
there was but little difference, but as
the competition worn on the feather
weight, having less to carry, flew over
the weed, a bit the earlier.

CARDINAL MEN
WILL BE BUSY
Lengthy Schedule Framed
Up for Both Track Ath
letes and Ball Tossers
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 11.
Manager R. W. Barrett has secured a
partial schedule for the track and base
ball teams. The most important pre
liminary field day will be held at Po
mona between the track teams of Po
mona College and Stanford University.
Treasurer Barrett has other meets in
view, and it is probable that a field
day will be held each Saturday until
the week before the intercollegiate meet
with California.
This season the freshman track team
will also take part ln several field
meets. On February 22 It will contest
with the combined teams of Santa
Clara and San Jose high schools. Later
the 1908 team will meet the athletes of
the Bay Cities League and Santa Rosa.
A long series of games with Santa
Clara and St. Mary's College has been
arranged for the cardinal baseball
team. For the last two years these
Catholic Colleges have worsted Stan
ford at baseball, and this year's games
will be hotly fought. Other games for
the varsity will be scheduled as the
season progresses, but the present
schedule is as follows: Santa Clara,
January 28; St. Mary's, February 4;
Santa Clara, February 11; St. Mary's,
February 18; St. Mary's, March 11;
Santa Clara, March 23. The intercolle
giate games with California will be
played on April 1, 8 and 22.
For the first time in the history of
Stanford and the University of Califor
nia athletics, there will be held this
year an intercollegiate freshman base
ball series. What sort of a 1908 team
Stanford will develop Is merely a con
jecture, as no chance for practice has
been given the youngsters. The idea of
an Intercollegiate freshman match is to
keep the young baseball material en
couraged.
nels' black and white pointer Midget,
handled by A. S. Carlisle and J. A.
Peebles; orange and white English set
ter Uncle Jimmy Whitestone, handled
by J. E. Lucas. TJiis brace was cast
down where there were a lot of quail
and gave a good exhibition of point
work, which proved the leading char
acteristics of both dogs, one scoring six
and the otiier seven stanch points. A
change was then made to another field,
where S. N. Morris' liver and white
pointer, Faith, handled by Carlisle and
Rose, and Christenson's black, white
and tan English setter, Bellex Fontain,
handled by Coutts, were cast off. This
was the only blank heat so far during
the stakes.
"While the dogs worked Industriously
over several large fields no birds were
found. The range and pace of these
dogs were not to be compared * with
other of the preceding braces.
HARRY H DISFTAYS SPEED.
After luncheon served at the Gosford
Ranch, W. W. Van Arsdale's black and
white English setter, Harry H, handled
by Babcock, and Charles Shaw's liver
and white pointer, Oak Knoll, handled
by J. E. Lucas, were cast off in a new
field into which a number of birds had
been flushed. Harry H going at a clip
ping pace ran into a group of three or
four birds and instantly dropped to
wing.
Soon after Oak Knoll secured a good
point on which he was perfectly
stanch. This was followed by one by
Harry H. This was repeated over and
over, the free dog backing whenever
possible except once, when Oak Knoll
ran in badly. In range the two dogs
were about equal, both making many
wide casts. Harry H's slashing speed
and beautiful way of going placed the
other dog at a disadvantage.
The annual meeting field trials
club was held to-night. The old offi
cers were re-elected as follows:

Giant Shotpntter Is Under
the Ban for All Time at
Ann Arbor Institution
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANN ARBOR. Jan. 11.âRalph Rose
was to-night barred from all Michigan
athletic teams by action of the Univer
sity of Michigan board of control. The
board formally decided that the great
shot-putter by competing without per
mission for the Chicago Athletic Asso
ciation at New York during his Christ
mas vacation had violated rule thirteen
of the Western conference, and was
therefore for all time ineligible to com
pete for Michigan. The big athlete
himself has not yet appeared to make
any explanation of his action.
Rose is at present spending his win
ter vacation at his home in Healdsburg.
He returned from the East a few weeks
ago, and at that time it was rumored
that the great shot-putter would not
return to Michigan. He complained of
"too much knocking" in the East and
thought he was not getting an even
break.
It is not unlikely that Rose will enter
Stanford University soon. Some time
ago he gave out that he would like to
wear the cardinal, but changed his
mind and returned to Ann Arbor.

FALSE RUMOR DISTURBS
JOCKEY PIGGOTT'S FATHER
Reads of Son's Death, But Message
From State Department Allays
Fears.
HONOLULU. Jan. I.âLast Sep
tember a call was made at the office
of the secretary of the Territory here
by John Plggott, an employe of the
Honolulu Iron Works, who said he
had read of the death of his son, Joe
Piggott, the jockey. The latter was
reputed killed In Russia. He asked
for Information and the request was
forwarded to the State Department at
Washington. A few days ago the
Governor's mail contained a communi
cation from Secretary of State Hay
enclosing correspondence from the
American embassy at St. Petersburg.
It was stated that Jockey Piggott had
fully recovered from injuries sustained
in a race and was spending the winter
at the Hotel San Remo at Rostoff on
the Don.

Sir JVilfred Again Proves Too
Speedy for the East Filly
Daruma,
SAD SAM IS UNPLACED
" BY FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
Any time that Bombardier can min
gle with a select few, where every
body behaves like a real lady or gen
tleman and there Is no bumping or
jostling, he Is sure pumpkins. Frank
Skinner's Maxlo gelding started in a
sprint handicap on Tuesday but was
outfooted from the start, and finished
last. With a heavier track to run over
and only three starters to compete
against, he looked to have a rare good
chance in the $1000 mile and a six
teenth handicap at Oakland yesterday.
W. Davis again had the mount on
Bombardier, and the books held him
second choice. He won hands down
from Oro Viva, after Nlgrette, the 9 to
10 favorite, had mapped out the route
to the far turn. The black mare even
there began hoisting distress signals,
and was downed five lengths for the
place by Oro Viva. Major Mansir
could not keep within hailing dis
tance of the leaders.
Favorites captured four of the six
events decided. The books would have
had a decidedly off day but for the
downfall of Sad Sam in the concluding
race.
For the introductory Futurity course
run, with a bunch of ten starting, Sub
urban Queen ruled a slight favorite
over Yellowstone. O. Chandler, who
had the mount on the first choice, got
the mare away in front, kept her there
and won easily from Brennus. Yellow
stone met with some Interference on
the back stretch, though eventually
running third.
SIR WILFRED LIKES MUD.
Sir Wilfred now has the "Injun sign"
on Daruma, for he has beaten her
twice. From the manner ln which he
tramped along through the mud in the
baby event the youngster has not
shown around these parts that can
lower the colors of the Cameron colt.
Ridden by Jakie Jones, the son of
Ossary and Plumeria had first dill In
the betting and scored without effort
after leading from the time the barrier
was released. Daruma ran gamely un
der Bullman's hard urging, but could
not get up, losing by three lengths. Abe
Meyer ran third.
Staggering at the finish, Mlmo, the
favorite, received a nose decision over
Educate at the close of the six and a
half furlong event. The first choice had
Davis in the saddle and cut out all the
running. He bumped Educate some as
the wire was approached, but a claim
of foul on the part of Chandler, who
piloted Educate, was not considered.
Flaneur, a 50 to 1 shot, took third
position. With a rider up Glendene
would have had a chance. McÃride on
Riesca rode a poor race. â¢

nimble as a club man with the gout
would climb a flight of stairs. He
look a 1 to 3 chance, but his infirmities
created a very generous quotation. Rid
den again by Bullman the aged cam
paigner scored easily, after Vigoroso
had played a one ; night stand out in
front. Theodora L and Gin Spray, two
fancy priced ones, ran second and third
respectively. Adirondack retired very
early.
Sad Sam stock opened strong at the
call on the last race, but the curb
stone brokers handled him with the ut
most recklessness later on. A decided
slump sent the price to 9 to 5, and the
smart ones were not buyers. The half
breed sprinter was outfooted by David
Boland from the jump, or at least W.
Daly extracted more speed from David.
The favorite finally melted away to
nothing. Anderson on W. R. Condon
rode a live, energetic race, reaching
home the handiest sort of a winner over'
Squire Johnson, another outsider. San
Nicholas took the show. Ten to one
could be had abouÂ£ the winner.
TRACK NOTES.
W. Davis was there with two win
ners again.
O. Chandler handled Suburban
Queen very cleverly and only lost the
decision with Educate by a nose.
Emmett Doague could win some
races if given the opportunity. He
showed to good advantage on long
shots and some owner might give the
boy a chance on one that could put it
over.
Possibly McÃride thought he rode
an excellent race on Riesca. He
didn't, and the next time the mare
starts, instead of being 15 to 1, she
will probably be 8 to 5.
Charley Henshall stated last even
ing that he would ship his stable to
Los Angeles on Saturday evening.
Jack Joyner, the noted Eastern
trainer and owner, arrived from New
York last night. He will probably
have W. Davis under his wing next
season.
Jimmy McLaughlin, the former
famous rider now racing a string of
horses at Los Angeles, will ship Pas
adena up here to start in the Burns
handicap.
Colonel Applegate got in from Se
attle last night. The poolroom In
terests at that point have been pooled.
Twenty-two books cut in yesterday,
one less than at the previous drawing.
Thomas Fitzgerald is now the own
er of Edrodun, having purchased the
three-year-old at private sale.
A carload of horses reached Oak
land from Los Angeles last night.
Among the lot were Tarn O'Shanter,
owned by J. L-. Tullett; three or four
belonging to Jimmy Coffey and An
drew Mack, the latter consigned to
.Billy Cahill.

CANNOT GIVE
RACING NEWS
Town Trustees of Emeryville
Make It a Crime to Do So
Unless Right Is Obtained
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 11.
Emeryville Is the first town on rec
ord to enact an ordinance making it
a crime punishable by fine and impris
onment for anyVerson to give out in
formation concerning a horse race
without first obtaining the permission
of the managers of the track. The
measure legalises the power of the
officials of the California Jockey Club
to say who shall or who shall not han
dle the racing results in the town of
Emeryville. Its primary object is to
keep pool rooms from securing infor
mation from the track. Although this
authority has always been claimed and
exercised heretofore by the proprietors
of the California Jockey Club, It was
not until Monday night that the Town
Trustees passed the ordinance that
practically gives the track managers a
corner on the conveying of all racing
results.

SIXTY-TWO STUDENTS
MUST LEAVE STANFORD
Only Three Women Among Those
Dropped Because of Lack of
Scholarship.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 11.
Because of the lack of scholarship
shown In their work during the past
semester, sixty-two students were
dropped from the register of the uni
versity by the committee on scholar
ship. Seventy-eight others received
notice that unless an Immediate im
provement in the quality of their work
was shown they would be dropped
some time during this semester.
No athlete of any prominence was
forced to leave, all of the foot
ball, baseball and track . men
being well up in their work. Of the
total number dropped but three were
women.

I had Nasal Catarrh for years for which I
used S. S. S. with very gratifying result*.
I tried local applications for some time,
and getting no permanent relief I came to
the conclusion that the seat of the trouble
was in the blood. Knowing S. S. S. to be
a good blood medicine I began its use,
and after using it for some little while it
did away entirely with the offensive mu

hawk and spit, especially in the morning,
to dislodge the catarrhal matter.

port for about forty-five days. Dur
ing her stay she will go to the navy
yard at Mare Island to be placed on
drydock and to undergo a thorough
overhauling. The Protet is one of the
speediest vessels in the French navy.
When clean she can reel off twenty
one knots with ease. As she Is at
present, hampered by a heavy growth
of grass and barnacles, she is far from
being a snail and if circumstances de
manded haste could make something
like eighteen knots an hour.
The Protet is the best known here
of the foreign war vessels that visit
this port. Once upon a time this was
B favorite port of call for British and
other ships of war. A few visits dur
ing sailor famines, however, convinced
the rulers of alien navies that the San
Francisco crimp was altogether too
shrewd and active. Whole liberty
parties were annexed by sailor board -
mc, house runner? and shipped on
v. haters and deep sea merchantmen.
Every visiting warship was a larpe
but involuntary contributor to the
lix-al sailor supply, end as the hands of
the commanding officer were tied in
the matter of recruiting here it grad
ually became tha custom to give San
Francisco a. wide berth, ll is only on
special occasions now that one of King
Edward's vessels drops ln here and
other foreign visitors are few and far
between.
U'uh the Protet, however, it is dif
ferent She is a frequent visitor and
her wardroom is better known to
local society than the wardrooms of
many of our own ships. The Protet's
officers in the past have been made
much of in a social way and those
now on board who have been here be
fore yesterday expressed their delight
at again coming within reach of the
v ,:rni glow of California hospitality.
It is not unlikely that this may be
the Protet's last visit to this port. Her
oilicers expect that before they leave
here orders will be received for the
< miser's return to France.
The cruiser is anchored off Folsom
street wharf and as past visit
ors will be welcomed aboard.
Chilean Tax on Shipping.
The following letter has been teceived from
Captain Henry W. Campling, master ot the
British ship Kinross, now at Valparaiso:
'T regret to have to Inform you that an
extra tax on shipping visiting Chile has bÂ«>-n
ln force since the latter part of last July.
The new rate la 60 cents, Chilean golJ, per
registered ton for light dues, which, added to
the 10 cents Chilean gold, previously ln force
for hospital dues, makes a tax of 70 cents
Chilean gold per ton. At the present rate of
exchange it will amount to about Â£74 for
the Kinross. Not only this, but In our case
we have to pay twice, once for t'J'M at this
port and for 1905 at th- nitrate Dcrt.
"This extra tax for light dues is not gen
erally known ar.d the fact of it being Impossd
ought to be well circulated at San Franclscc,
for it requires a much higher rate of freight
tv enable ships to pay It."
Barkentine Hawaii Scuttled.
Word waa received yesterday from Kobe
that It had been found necessary to scuttl?
the barkentine Hawaii in oreler to extinguish
the flames which threatened the vessel. The
Hawaii was from Killisnoo. with a cargo cf
fertilizer. Fire" was discovered in the hold
during the voyage ana was supposed to have
t.-en extinguished. When the hatches were
taken off at Kobe it was discovered that the
fires had only been banked and with the In
rush of air they biased out fiercely. The
scuttling of the vessel settled the Are ar.d
the cargo Is now being discharged In fairly
i.ood condition.

BROTHER TELLS
ABOUT MONNIER
With the examination of a half dozen
witnesses yesterday in Judge Graham's
court, the widow's side of the Monnier
will contest was submitted, and to-day
the cross-examination of one of the six
win conclude the hearing. The argu
ments will probably be made next
Monday.
The star for the proponents was Pe
ter Monnier. brother of the deceased
winemaker. He is serving as a juror in
Judge Lawior's court in the Wyman
case, which was cut short yesterday
afternoon to permit him to appear on
the ritand in detense of his brother's
stronemindedness. He declared that
Geo ge Monnier was a man of iron will,
and had'everything his own way. If
he was influenced by his wife. It waa
the influence that a good wife haa
oyer a good husband: he was of an
< x< itable temper, "ln the French way,"
but auick to forgive, as the witness
had occasion to know when they were
in business together and had a falling
out. When asked if George Monnier
was a drinking man, Peter aptly said:
"I know of no man ln the business
who will not take what is good for him,
but he is not compelled to."
The brother said that George had
consulted him about the adoption of
George Jr. Peter had seven children
of his own. but he was certain that
George was not present when the adop
tion papers werp signed. The witness
told of quarrels In the family and said
that George Jr. was below the aver
age young man in his treatment of his
adopted father.
Of the other witnesses. T. P. Riordan,
a real estate dealer, said that he had
heard the elder Monnier express satis
faction with the provisions of his will,
declaring that he would leave the boy
nothing. Selina Howes, a friend of the
family, who took her Sunday dinner
with the Monniera, told of quarrels, bad
names, and the unfillal behavior of
George Jr. Frank Schaffer, an employe
of the wine merchant, told a like tale,
and John Meyer and Anton Borel, old
acquaintances of the deceased, ex
pressed their opinion of his soundness
of mind.
HOUSE IS NOT
HIS DOMICILE
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler
Says a Man May Have Sev
eral Places of Residence
CLOSES LONG ARGUMENT
J. C. Campbell Concludes
Presentation of Cause
in Dunsmuir Will Case
The battle for the Dunsmuir millions
was again in progress in Judge Coffey's
court during both sessions yesterday.
Mr. Campbell finished his long argu
ment In the morning, and Charles S.
Wheeler began his reply to the plain
tiff's mc-tioa to have the will set aside
at the opening of the afternoon session.
Attorney Wheeler devoted nearly all
his time to the definition of the words
"residence" and "domicile." Upon what
Judge Coffey may believe to be the
meanings of these words, may rest the
decision regarding the validity of the
famous document.
J. C. Campbell in closing his exhaus
tive argument upon the subject made
a short and very concise resume of the
facts he had presented in his long
address. He closed his argument by
reading the affidavit of James Duns
muir made when he petitioned the
courts in Victoria to have the will
probated. He laid great stress on the
fact that ln the affidavit of James
Dunsmuir It was especially cited that
Alexander Dunsmuir at the time of the
making of his will was a resident of
San Francisco and of the State of Cali
fornia.
During the afternoon session Attor
ney Wheeler told the court that he was
suffering from a terrible cold, but that
he would go on with his reply as long
as he was able to speak. He then asked
Judge Coffey if he would grant permis
sion for his associate counsel from Vic
toria to be allowed to speak before the
bar here. Judge Coffey consented. Mr.
Wheeler, replying to the argument of
Mr. Campbell, said he had three prop
ositions to place before the court; viz:
That the counsel for plaintiff take the
case in question before a court of
equity; that the words domi
cile" and "residence" be de
clared to have separate mean
ings, and that the counsel for plaintiff
be found to have misconstrued the law
in regard to the jurisdiction of the
court.
Mr. Wheeler then stated that the de
cree of distribution of the Alexander
Dunsmuir estate had been granted
over three and a half years ago; that
the Attorneys. Wilson & Wilson, had
been settled with and had withdrawn
from any connection with the estate,
and that service had not been made in
proper form. "Notwithstanding these
informalities," Wheeler said, "we are
here to reply to plaintiffs' arguments.
"The word residence said Wheeler
"upon which so much stress is made
by plaintiffs' attorney, has several
meanings. It is a word of doubtful
definition. A man may have a dozen
residences but only one domicile. A
residence in some senses would only
mean a 'temporary residence.' A man
might sojourn in a residence, but ho
could not sojourn In his domicile."
The opposing attorneys base their
case upon the question cf domicile anVI
use it In conjunction with the word
residence. Taking the word residence
in one sense it would support the valid
ity of the will and in another it would
destroy its validity.
The case will come up for hearing at
11 a. m. to-day.
PHYSICIAN'S WIFE WALKS
EIGHTY-SIX CITY BLOCKS
Says Husband Denied Her Carfare
With Which to Return From a
Visit to Mother.
William M. McLaren, a physician,
whose wife says he has an income of
$200 a month and owns property on
H street, near Tenth avenue, worth
$5000, has woefully neglected her, ac
cording to her suit for divorce filed
yesterday. She declares that she went
to visit her mother and the doctor re
fused to give her carfare to return
home. She was compelled to walk
eighty-six blocks tin the night and was
exhausted and made ill by the ex
traordinary journey afoot. They were
married In 1901 and since then, she
says, he has frequently abused her
with vile names, and on New Tear's
day he told her that he did not want
,to live with her any longer. She asks
i for $30 a month alimony.
Judge Graham yesterday granted a
' divorce to Lillian W. Brown from Ed
ward Brown on the ground of cru
elty. She charged him with gambling
and intemperance and says that once
he drank carbolic acid with suicidal
intent, but she saved him. After the
suit was filed be applied to the court

year-old boy. He took the child out
several times, then kidnaped the
youngster and neither has been heard

room at 1203 Market street late on
Tuesday night and shortly after he
was sent to his room the smell of es- â 
caping gas was At the
Emergency Hospital Dr. Herzog said
that there was litle hope of saving his

CELEBRATE FALL
OF THE FORTS
Local Japanese Associations
S]>end Entire Day in Sport,
Speech making and Song
MANY THOUSAND ATTEND
Novel Portrayal of Customs
of Nippon Attracts Crowd
of American Visitors
â¦
Local Japanese patriots celebrated
the fall of Port Arthur yesterday at
the Presidio Athletic Grounds, with
singing, speechmaking and all manner
of Japanese games and races. All day
long thousands of Japanese who were
able to leave their work filed in and out
of the grounds while many spent the
entire day In the big grandstand. Hun
dreds of pretty little Japanese girls,
from the various schools, in charge of
American teachers, added life and
gayety to the scene, and scattered
throughout the crowd were many
Americans attracted by the novelty of
the entertainment.
At 9:30 yesterday morning the cele
bration began with the singing of the
Klmigayo, the Japanese national an
them, and this was followed by an ad
dress by Mr. loki, a graduate of Cali
fornia University. Mr. Takada, secre
tary of the Japanese society, followed
with the reading of the Japanese edict
declaring war with Russia and was
heartily cheered. The cheering in
creased with the arrival of Japa
nese Consul Uyeno, who responded with
a short speech. The morning's speech
making closed with an address by the
Rev. Mr. Hosugai, of the Japanese
Methodist Episcopal church.
The afternoon was given over ex
clusively to sports and feats of strength
and the distribution of prizes. Hun
dreds of bare-legged, bare-armed ath
letes of Nippon swarmed over the
Held, running races, polevaulting.
Jumping and wrestling, to the delight
of thousands of their countrymen.
The athletes were divided into two
sections, one wearing blue and white
caps of the Japanese Y. M. C. A. and
the other the red and white caps of
the Japanese Methodist Episcopal
school. A third detachment wore the
red and white ribbons of the student
class and took sides in the sham battle
that opened the afternoon. The com
batants were armed with Japanese
armor and bamboo two handed swords.
They whacked each other lustily In
Japanese style. At the conclusion of
the fight nine "red" and three "blue"
men were left standing and the "reds"
were hailed as victors.
following the battle came pole
vaulting, running broad jumping, 300
--yard dash, three-legged race, obstacle
races, a blindfold race and a half-mile
run. Japanese straight catch-as-catch
can wrestling and Japanese fencing
ended the day's sport. The prizes were
distributed by Miss Margarita Lake, of
the Japanese Women's Home.
Peterson's Conduct Was Rough.
Martin Peterson when sober is a
quiet man, but when drink gets the
better of his senses he does rough
stunts at his home at 18% Freelon
street, as was made apparent yesterday
when he upset the peace and quiet of
hir family by removing the stove
from its accustomed place and setting
it on the center of the kitchen floor
and otherwise turning things about.
This caused his wife to reason that he
had lost his mind. Accepting this
charitable view of her husband she
had him taken to the Emergency Hos
pital for a diagnosis of his ailment.
The hospital authorities passed Peter
son over to Captain Mooney, who
diagnosed his case as "booze" and
had him booked as "drunk."

English Stockholder of
British Firm in America
LONDON COURT'S RULING
â¢
Attempt to Collect From an
Individual of Company in
California Not a Success
c .
LONDON. Jan. 11.âA decision to-day
of the King's Bench division of the
High Court of Justice debars American
creditors from recovering debts from
shareholders of British companies do
ing business in America.
The question arose through a suit of
the Risdon Iron Works Company, which
sought to recover from Sir Christopher
Furness as a shareholder of the Cop
per King, Limited, now liquidating, the
cost of work supplied to the latter com
pany in California. The plaintiffs con
tended that as the Copper King Com
pany did business in California the
shareholders were amenable to the Cal
ifornia laws, and therefore liable for
the company's debts.
The court held that the Copper King
was an English company, and that the
liability of the shareholders was limited
to paying In full for their shares.
MUST GO TO SAN QUENTIN. âThe Su
preme Court yesterday decided that Charie*
Clark must "spend two years at San Quentin
for the commission of grand larceny In Los
Angeles eighteen months ago. Clark con
tended that the Jury had been Improperly
charged by the trial court.

THE MODERN ORIGIN
OF VICTORIA SWINE
New Composite Breed Which Was
Produced in 1850 by Careful
Crossing.
The Victoria swine is a composite
breed of comparatively modern origin.
There are two distinct branches or
breeds that are called Victorias, and
have originated from two different in
dividuals, says the Detroit Live Stock
Journal. The older branch was orig
inated in Saratoga County, New York,
by Colonel Frank D. Curtis, and denom
inated a breed as early as 1850. It was
made up of a combination of the
blood of the Grazier, Byfleld, York
shire and Suffolk. These bear a close
resemblance to the Suffolk, except the
lack of the deep dlsh-in face.
The other was originated by George
Davis, Dyer, Lake County, Ind. They
are the outcome of the amalgamation
of the Poland China, Chester Whites,
Berkshires and Suffolks. They were
called a breed as early as 1870. They
appeared at the fairs ln Indiana and
Illinois and at the Fat Stock Show in
Chicago, in IS7B. They were acknowl
edged as a distinct breed by the Illi
nois State Board of Aflriculture in 1882.
Sim ~ that time they have been quite
successful winners at the " Fat Stock
Show, Chicago, and have received rec
ognition â¢ from several other State or
ganizations.
The Victoria Swine Breeders' Asso
ciation was organized in 1886. In 1887
the first volume of the register was
published and two subsequent volumes
have followed. From the small begin
nings the number of animals recorded
has reached beyond 1600, which shows
that the breed is growing in populari
ty. When we consider that only stock
that is likely to be kept for breeders
will be placed on record it is a good
showing.
The Victorias seem to occupy a posi
tltjn distinctively their own and are not
close imitators of the other breeds. In
size they are not the equal to the Po
land China, but somewhat larger than
some of the so-called small breeds, de
pending greatly on the individual in
whose hands they are reared. It Is
claimed that they are easily adapted to
surrounding conditions, and thrive
either in field or pen. We conclude from
a close examination and study of them
that they can be fattened in any age.
The superior feeding qualities, as well
as the quality of the meat, has been
proven by their winnings, in both live
and dead classes, at the fat stock Bhows
at Chicago.
In general appearance the "Victorias
are strong and growthy, and in the
typical specimens are quite symmetri
cal in outline. They are not quite so
large as the Berkshlres, nor do they
seem to, as yet, equal them in uniform
ity. They are white, while the Berk
shire is black with white points. The
originator once declared that he had
"produced the model hog, guaranteed
to reproduce itself white."âBaltimore
American.
An Elusive Debtor.
Collecting money from Turkey Is a
heart-breaking enterprise. A distin
guished American once went there to
collect a debt of $500,000 owing to an
English syndicate, which included two
members of Parliament and a Cabinet
Minister. He expected to see the busi
ness through in two or three months.
But a foreign Embassador undeceived
him. "Say three or four months, and
then you will be as far off from ob
taining your money as you are to-day,"
he remarked. Men had gone out there
to prosecute claims, he added, whose
hair had turned gray with the strain
to which they were subjected, and who
had gone home thoroughly broken in
health, unable to obtain a Turkish lira
to show for years of fruitless labor.
One victim of Turkish duplicity and
procrastination died in a lunatic asy
lum. One of the embassies had been
twenty-five years prosecuting claims,
without realizing a cent.âExchange.
Knee Breeches Coming Again.
As King Edward has cast his royal
eye with favor on the revival of knee
breeches, stockings and pumps for
men's evening wear, and as the latter
part of this month has been set for the
appearance of a party at a dinner in
the Carleton House, London, garbed
as in the days of the* Georges, the imi
tative set in New York is in a flutter.
Nothing will do but that this custom
shall be adtvted here immediately. The
women, without stopping to think how
unbecoming "short clothes" would be
to many pairs of metropolitan shanks,
are more clamorous for the innovation
than the men. It is not purposed to
appear in silken breeches and stock
inged legs on special occasions only,
but every evening after dinner, whether
in the home, at a theater, in the street
or at a late supper.âChicago Chronicle.
LONDON CAB DRIVERS
FINDING POOR BUSINESS
Little Call for Them and Little
Money, Though Work
Is Hard.
There are in London 2711 cab pro
prietors and of these 2224 own fewer
than Aye vehicles. As you see, it is
a poor man's industry. There is only
one large companyâthe London Im
proved Cab Company, which owns 500
cabs; the Earl of Shrewsbury and Tal
bot, who was once a large owner, went
out of business. In the main, then,
the small proprietorâthe "mush" â
who owns a few cabs and drives one
himself, controls the trade. The aver
age price for hiring a cab is 12s 3d a
day. In addition the cabman has to
pay the yard fees. He gets two horses
a day and is usually fourteen hours on
the box. His license costs him 5 shil
lings a year. The tax of Â£2 on the
cab and the 15 shillings wheel duty are
paid by the owner.
Taking it day in and day out the
cabby makes about 5 shillings a day.
In the season he may take ln more
money, but as the hire Is raised on
him it comes to the same thing. If he
is not content âand there is no reason
why he should beâhe does not grumble
unduly. Every day In London 120,000
people ride in cabs. Of course there is
friction and there is a great deal of
noisy quarreling over fares, but, so
far as my experience goes, the cabby
is usually right in his estimate of the
distance he . has traveled and the
money that Is due him.
The cab horses are a good lot. They
are worked six hours a day on an
average. About three years in a han
som, however, will do up the best of
them. Then they drift down to the
four-wheelers. A melancholy vehicle,
that. You remember, do you not,
Gregers in Ibsen's "Wild Duck, whose
unhappy destiny It was to be, always
thirteenth at table? It Is the gloomy
function of the four-wheeler to "follow
with the luggage." At best it never
rises higher than the funotion of
freighting home roysterers and bad
husbands, night wasters and cordial.
Ignoble girls. A melancholy destiny.
The driver of a four-wheeler pays
less cab rentâ6 or 7 shilling a dayâbut
his earning power, Is less than that of
the aristocratic of the craft; he is the
dickey. Usually he is a weedy old man
who has looked out on life through
red-lidded eyes so long and has come
to know it so well that the milk of
human kindness in him is mere curds
and whey. He Is essentially a crea
ture of the fog and night. Mankind,
as he knows it, is either coming away
from a railroad station with too much
luggage or going home sodden or riot
ous with too much drink. Why should
he have confidence in his fellew men?
He and not Edgar Saltus should have
written the "Philosophy of Disenchant
ment." His melancholy destiny is to
go through life trying to detect pewter
half-crowns. âNovember Outing.
Many events are blessings dressed up
like misfortunes.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. 11.âSuch a market as
there was for stock to-day was restricted to
testing operations by professionals In attempts
to discover the trend of the market. The at
tempts were unsuccessful, for the simple reason
that the market had no trend. There was a
condition of lethargy, with prices very near
to last nlghÂ£s level. The undertone is un
deniably firm and such testing operations as
tne professionals venture upon are Indicative
of a spirit of hopefulness for higher prices.
For several days past the early transactions
have been light, buying orders following re
cessions and the disappointing fact Is devel
oped that traders are alone in the market.
This stagnant condition of speculation is v
surprise to those who looked for active deal
ings with the January congestion of money
supply and the effort to find explanation for
It points to various surmises. The natural
accumulation of money in New York iÂ» modi
fled to some extent by the outgo of gold and
next week's requirement of $10,000,000 lor the
return of Government deposits Is a subject for
consideration. But the almost plethoric con
dition of the money market and the loan in
terest rates urevailing make this an improb
able explanation for the neglected speculation.
The unprecedented rush of depositors at the
local savings banks this week is offered as
part explanation of the diversion of Invest
ment funJs, the attraction being the advance
In the interest rate tc depositors offered by
many Â«f the banks. Then there Is some dis
trust of the level to which prices had been
pushed in anticipation of the January' move
ment. The. rise of a few special stocks left
â¦the Indeterminate tone of the market un
cfcangea up to the close.
. The movement of bond prices was irregular,
but there was a well diffused activity In the
riiarket. Total sales, par value. $3,540,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

Hay and Feedstuffs.
The Government has awarded an order for
1000 tons to this market and another for 1000
tons to the north. There still remain on its
army requirements over 5000 tons to be sup
plied, but the deliveries will extend over many
mouths, so do not affect the market.
The, circular of Somers A Co. says:
"Receipts of Hay for the past week have
amounted to 200<> tons, an increase of about
a thousand tons over the week preceding
The demand, though not heavy, has become a
little more active since the holidays, but con
signees still have difficulty in making dis
position of all their shipments. Prices have
not advanced, though we might say the mar
ket seems to have a steadier tone. We can
not but think this a temporary condition, pos
sibly caused by consumers' willingness to
stock up a bit for the\new year.
"There have been no Oriental . shipments
during the week, and the Government has
placed an order for a thousand tons, immedi
ate delivery, up north. Bide have just been
opened for the regular half year's supply for
the army ln the Philippines, but we think
it will not have any visible effect on the mar
ket, for the amount is not large when we con
sider that there are six months in which to
make delivery."

Harrison's circular says: '"Since the de
parture of the steamship Ventura, last month, i
there have been only two arrivals of Coal from
Newcastle N. S. W., viz: Gael. 209 tone, and \
E. B. Jackson. 1100 tons; total. 4009 tons
Since the beginning of last month there have
been but three arrivals here with 5860 tons,
hence the quantity here -in yard has been
considerably diminished within the past six
weeks. There are seventeen vessels on the
chartered Hat to load coal at Newcastle for
here, with a carrying capacity of about 43,000
tons, the major portion of which will not ar
rive before April or May next. The stormy
weather prevailing here lately has materially
Increased the sale of Australian grades, they
being in brisk demand for domestic uses.
Prices remain unchanged, although 75 per cent
of the colonial Coal remains under the control
locally of one firm. The existing ratea of
freight from Australia on Coal for this mar
ket are ruling at full figures, fifteen shillings
per ton being the present asking price; this
leaves a very meager profit for the Importer
and will probably lead to reduced shipments
this year, as the British Columbia product can
be delivered here at a much lower figure and
Is eagerly sought for by large consumers of
steam and house Coals. The oil product for
1904 will aggregate thirty millions of barrels,
so It can be readily figured that the sale for
steam fuel this year will be largely dimin
ished. It Is to be hoped that the importations
colonial Coal this year will at least equal ;
the Amount delivered here ln 1904. as that la
the smallest amount Imported for several
years."

TO FILL HOLES
WITH RED ROCK
Board of Works Orders Tem
porary Expedient to Rem
edy Condition of Streets
* The Board of Public Works yester
day directed Boone, inspector of street
repairs, to supervise the placing of red
rock in the numerous chuck-holes in
the bituminous street pavements as a
temporary expedient to remedy the dis
graceful condition of the city's thor
oughfares due to the persistent disputefl
between the Supervisors' Finance Com
mittee on the one side and the Board
of Works and the F. M. Yorke Com
pany on the other.
No work has been done by the latter
company, which has the $40,000 contract
for repairs to bituminous pavements,
since the controversy began some two
months ago. The company demands
payment of some $14,000 due for previ
ous work, alleging that the money is
required for it to prosecute further
work. The Finance Committee will
not pay the September demand of the
company unless It resumes the repairs,
and there the matter stands. Commis
sioner Aigeltinger declared that the
streets are in a frightful condition and
accidents both to human beings and
horses are becoming frequent. He said
some means should be devised to have
the contract carried gut.
The Board of Public Works desires
to reduce the possibility of accidents by
filling in the most dangerous chuck
holes with red rock. The holes in front
of the Phelan building will be treated
in that manner, as they are probably
the most dangerous ones ln the city.
The cost of the work, Commissioner
Maestretti said, cannot be met with the
appropriation for repairs, but will be
paid.
The board cited the members of the
F. M. Yorke Company to appear at its
meeting next Saturday morning for the
purpose of holding a conference with a
view to repairing the bad pavements.
Counting the work already done, which
the city has not yet paid for, there re
mains some 530.000 to be expended, and
in the present condition of the streets
this amount is not one-tenth enough to
improve them.
City Architect Shea reported to ths
board that the attorneys of the Cowell
estate say there is a difference of eight
een inches between private surveys and
the City Engineer surveys of the lines
of Merchant, Sansome and Clay streets.
The estate is about to erect an eight
story building on the east side of San
some street, between Merchant and
Clay, which, according to the lines of
the city map, will prove an encroach
ment.
To prevent this Shea asked that the
City Engineer furnish the official lines
of the three streets named and this was
ordered to be done.
The board recommended the curbing
and the bituminizing of Grove street,
between Scott and Devisadero. the city
to pay for one-half of the work and
property owners agreeing to pay the
other half.
The petition of the Pavers' Union
that a union foreman be put in charge
of the pavers was filed.
The board adopted a resolution, giv
ing, notice that on and after January
26 it will meet on Wednesdays st 1:80
o'clock p. m.
CALIFORNIA IS LEADING

There was evidence that the child lay
under the trucks of the car for a con
si deVable time before workmen ar
rived with the necessary tools to re

the motorman from all blame and
suggested that the United Railroads
provide suitable afleans for lifting cars

DESERTS WIFE
IN NEW YORK
Dr. Carl Graeb Comes Here
With Woman, Five Young
Children and Furniture
PLACED UNDER ARREST
AVronged Spouse Traces Him
and Asks Aid in Getting
Possession of Offspring
Dr. Carl Graeb, who is accused of
having deserted his wife in New York
last October and eloping with Mrs.
' Francisco Boda, a midwife, was arrest
ed here yesterday on a warrant issued
by Police Judge Cabaniss. The com
plaining witness is Officer W. H.
Young of the California Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The
arrest was made by Detectives Braig
and Sllvey.
Mrs. Graeb was left not only penni
less, but her five children, the oldest 15
and the youngest 4 years of age, were
taken by the husband. The house was
. stripped of all its furniture and effects
and even Mrs. Graeb's personal prop
erty, including her clothing, was packed
and forwarded to this city.
As soon as Mrs. Graeb learned that
her husband, accompanied by Mrs. Bo
da and the five children, had left for
this city, she determined to follow
them. On her arrival she consulted
Secretary White at the California So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children. Policeman Young was de
tailed to assist Mrs. Graeb in finding
the runaways. They were traced to 404
Third street, and from there to San
Jose. Mrs. Graeb arrived in San Jose
Just a day too late, and the search was
resumed in this city. They were finally
traced to 1829 Ellis street, where Dr.
Graeb and Mrs. Boda were living as
husband and wife. Mrs. Graeb met two
of her boys on the street on Tuesday
evening and they told her to keep out
of the way of their father, as he would
kill her. Mrs. Graeb laid her troubles
before Congressman Julius Kahn, and
' yesterday morning the warrant for Dr.
Graeb's arrest was obtained from Judge
Cabaniss. When the detectives went
to the house on Ellis street the woman
and the children had disappeared. Mrs.
Graeb is anxious to obtain possession of
the children and take them back with
her to New York. Yesterday afternoon
she got a search warrant from Judge
Cabaniss to recover possession of her
personal effects from the house on El
lis street.
Mrs. Graeb said her husband first
met Mrs. Boda seven years ago. At
that time he had a large practice in
New York. He became infatuated with
the woman, neglected his business and
was expelled from every society he was
connected with. He got the furniture
away by telling his wife they had to
leave their house and he would place
it in storage. Her husband, she says,
belongs to a wealthy family in Ger
many and he received a large remit
tance from his father's estate about
every six months. Just before he and
Mrs. Boda left he received a remit
tance of $1200. Mrs. Boda's husband
died about two years ago.

LAD'S BIG PHYSIQUE
DECEIVES GROCER.
FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD WITH
SIZE AND VOICE 0E MAN
Easily Buys Flask of Whisky
Suspecting that Edward Riley,
grocer at Leavenworth and Glover
streets, respected neither the letter nSr
the spirit of the ordinance which pro
hibits the selling or giving of intoxi
cants to minors, Patrolman Flynn en
listed a 14-year-old lad to serve
as a decoy and thus rout or confirm
nis suspicion. The youth was pro
vided with money and instructed to
purchase a flask of spirituous liquor
4 1.
from Mr. Riley, which he did with
neatness and dispatch. Mr. Riley was
arrested, and in Police Judge Mogan's
court the bottle of whisky which he
had sold to the minor was produced
as Exhibit A for the prosecution.
"But wait till you see the boy,
Judge," said Mr. Riley. "If he ain't
the healthiest 14-year-old you ever
saw I'll plead guilty."
The boy stood about five feet eleven
inches in his shoes and his girth was
in proportion. Furthermore, his voice
was a deep, rich baritone. But his
age was vouched for. He will be
fifteen his next birthday.
Mr. Riley admitted having sold the
whisky, but alleged he did so under
the impression that he was selling It to
a young man whose age, as. indicated
by his appearance, might be aijywhere
from twenty to twenty-five years.
Business was brisk when the liquor
was called for, else the grocer might
have devoted more time to inspection
of the customer. To enhance his de
ception the youth had drawn his hat
over his eyes, thus hiding any evidence
of adolescence that might have been
afforded by his smooth forehead.
"Just look at; him for yourself.
Judge," Mr. Riley appealed, "and then
tell me if you'd ever suspect him of
being a minor."
After the Judge had commanded
the boy to put on his hat, and had
carefully noted the effect thus created,
the charge against Mr. Riley was dis
missed.
"That lad'll be a comfort to his par
ents when he grows up," remarked
Bailiff Hickey as the stalwart 14-year
old strode from the courtroom.
* * *.
Splitting of hairs was indulged in by
the attorney representing Gustav Ahl
stead, accused by Martha, his wife, of
mixing strychnine with ground coffee
at their home, 331 Jessie street, his evi
dent intent being to poison her.
It was absurd, the able advocate aT
gued, to Imagine that Mr. Ahlstead
could be held to answer for attempted
poisoning. The statute covering such
cases prescribes that the poison must
be placed in "food, drink or medicine,"
and as ground coffee was none of those
commodities it was clearly the duty of
Judge Mogan to dismiss the complaint.
If the strychnine had been placed in
brewed coffee âmark the distinctionâ
then Mr. Ahlstead might both legally
and logically be committed for trial on
the felony charge, because brewed cof
fee is food, whereas ground coffee is
not.
Ere the court had time to folly digest
the foregoing plea its author sprung
another one almost as unanswerable.
It was to the effect that Mrs. Ahlstead
was disqualified to testify against her
husband by the fact that he had not
subjected her to physical violence, and
the law specifically states that a wife
cannot prosecute her spouse for at
tempting her life unless physical vio
lence has been used by him.
His Honor wearily continued the case
till to-morrow.

Frank C. Miller, accused by his male
parent of disturbing the peace of their
home, 1153 McAllister street, by vio
lently enforcing his protest against the
sire's noisy method of partaking of
soup, will not be tried on the charge,
because the complaint has been with
drawn and domestic tranquillity re
stored.
Young Mr. Miller declares that his
father's asthma had nothing whatever
to do with the soup incident. Miller
pere had been drinking to excess, he
avers, and spluttered over the soup be
cause it was peppered too heavily to
suit his taste, and he warmly accused
Miller nls of having maliciously perpe
trated the peppering. Denial of the
impeachment only served to make the
old gentleman's table manners even
more objectionable, and his compulsory
retirement to the kitchen was accom
plished by the son in the interest of
etiquette, and not with intent to do him
I bodily harm. The elder Miller also as
; serts it was pepper, and not asthma,
j that compelled him to gurgle in his

severed her # union with Harry Seeger,
told Judge Mogan that she had good
reason to believe that Seeger was dead
when she again approached the altar,
but to be on the safe side of the law she
instituted proceedings for divorce and
"was not aware that her wedding to
Johnson was illegal.
"This woman's accuser," thundered
her attorney, "is one Ben G. Baddeley,
whom she accuses of being a train rob
ber and whom the police suspect of be
ing the murderer of an officer in Oak
land. Will "the court please remember
that?"
"This woman's accuser is not on trial
just now," responded the Judge, "and
it makes no difference what his charac
ter is if this woman has willfully com
mitted bigamy, as charged."
Then a continuance till to-morrow
was asked for and granted.
Frank Harris, who was shot in the
neck by W. R. Worthington one day
last week in the latter's home, 120 Sixth
street, appeared in Judge Conlan's
court to prosecute his assailant, in
which task he was enthusiastically
aided by the defendant's wife and her
mother, Mrs. Ethel Irwin. Worthing
ton considered his pistol* play justified
by Harris' undue attentions to Mrs.
Worthington, but both that lady and
her maternal relative declared that Mr.
Harris had never exceeded the limits
of strict decorum in his dealings with
either of them. It was true, Mrs. Irwin
confessed, that Mr. Harris had taken
herself and daughter to the theater on
several occasions, but surely there was
nothing improper about that. Nor
would she deny that since the shooting
Mr. Harris and they have resided in
the same house, 393 Sixth street, but
she hoped no wrong construction would
be placed upon that fact.
"Is it not also true, Mrs. Irwin."
asked Worthington's attorney, "that
this defendant found his wife and
Harris sitting side by side upon a
lounge and that their defiant treatment
of him provoked the shooting?"
"That lounge racket is all a He. and
well you know it is, young sir," was
the answer; delivered with great sever
ity.
Mrs. Worthington also pronounced
the shooting of Mr. Harris absolutely
unprovoked by anything either Mr.
Harris or herself had ever said or done.
"It was the defendant's jealousy of you
that led to the shooting, wasn't it?"
the prosecuting attorney inquired, en
couragingly.
"I guess it was," replied Mrs. Worth
ington; "but I'm sure I don't. know
how any one could be jealous of me."
And the ungallant advocate of the
people glanced at the lady's none-too

Union delivered addresses at yester
day's session of the Bricklayers' and
Masons* convention. They talked on
the object of the union label and its

accomplished. They asked the delegates
to help this cause and work among the
other members of the union for recog

Beautiful souvenir programmes of
the convention were distributed among
the delegates. Tickets for the smoker
which was held last evening were giv

regard to changing and enlarging the
scope of the constitution and by-laws.
They were referred to the committees,

will be sent back to the convention.
A trolley ride has been planned for

HICKEY CLUBS
DEAD TO LIFE
An Inebriate Who Is Laid
Out on a Slab at Morgue
Receives Rude Awakening
*
ARRESTS THE CORPSE
Hector McClain Comes Back
! From the Beyond and Is
Escorted to .City Prison
â¢
A corpse awakened at the Morgue
! yesterday and was arrested for being
dead. Bailiff Hickey performed the
miracle with his club.
Nobody seems to know how the lively
dead man came to be reposing on one
of the slabs. He was Hector McClain
before he was officially declared dead
and labeled John Doe.
Olaf Olson, a mariner, wandered into
the mortuary looking for the remains
of a shipmate who had gone to Davy
Jones. Olaf bared his head respect
fully as he gazed upon the placid
i countenance of McClain. Just as he
was about to drop a tear he heard
something that sounded like a snore.
"Yimminey," muttered Olaf and his
hair adjusted itself into a pompadour.
He realized that ln the last sleep there
is no snoring.
The marble cold lips of McClain
opened. "Whisky," murmured the
sepulchral voice.
With a yell Olson darted into the
Central police station and staggered
into the arms of Bailiff Hickey. "There
bay a daid man at the Morgue who
wants some whisky," he panted.
"Come and show me," ordered
Hickey.
"I tank Ay better not," said Olson.
i "Ay tank Ay go away." And Olaf
j swung through the door on a port tack
I with all canvas spread.
j Hickey entered the chamber of silence
and looked at the placid features of
McClain. An irreverent fly alighted
; upon the nose of the deceased. The
i corpse raised Ks hand and smote the
I insect.
Bailiff Hickey drew his club and
struck the departed over the soles of j
the feet. "Lemme 'lone," complained
j the remains. But Hickey conducted
the corpse to the City Prison, where it j
I waa charged with being drunk. Had it !
not been for Olson's discovery McClain
might have been interred at the ex
pease of the city.

BIGGEST MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
MANUFACTURER IN THE WORLD
i
Forms Alliance With Largest Music
House on the Coast.
Probably the most important deal ever
I consummated in local piano circles has
! just been announced by the Weber Piano
; Company of New York City,
j This is the company which recently
' furnished so much talk throughout the
| piano world, both in this country and
' abroad, when it united interests with the
Aeolian and Pianola Company of Xew
York, thereby forming a single corpora
'â  tion with a capital of $11,000,000, and
bringing into and under its control the
following named musical instruments: m
The Pianola, the Aeolian, the Orches
trelle. the Aeolian Pipe Organ, the Weber
Pianola Piano, the Weber Piano, the
Wheelock Piano, the Stuyvesant Piano,
the Wheelock Pianola Piano, the Steck
; Pianola Piano and the Aeolian Pianola
Piano. â
This company is the largest manufac
; turer of musical instruments in the
i world, operating factories and owning
houses in New York City, London, Paris,
Berlin and Australia, #
The agency ot such a company is nat
l urally regarded the most desirable that
can be obtained in the musical trade, and
the matter of selecting an agency to rep
| resent this company on the coast has
L been given most careful consideration.
The first matter up for consideration
lin the choosing of a representative was
that of general standing and reputation.
Such a company as the Aeolian, Weber
Piano and Pianola Company, which is
the style of name assumed by the "mer
gered" interests, and whose instruments
are the standards of their type through
out the world, could afford only to be
represented by a concern of unquestioned
integrity in the trade.
This question settled, and the course
to be pursued largely remained a matter
of determining If that concern command
ed sufficient capital and possessed ade
quate facilities for handling the largest
volume of trade.
Kohler & Chase may well feel proud of
having been appointed to such a promi
i nent place in the music trade. No greater
| compliment could possibly be paid them,
I and it has been justly and fairly earned.
The house of Kohler & Chase was
! founded in IRSO. It was ot;tablished in
the same month of the year and only one
year after, the admission of California
into the States of the Union. Active, un
relenting toil of more than fifty years in
business has surely brought its rewardâ
the securing of the most valuable
agency in the musical trade.

NOTE GIVEN FOR LOSSES
AT CRAP GAME NOT VALID
H. T. Brickell, Who Borrowed His
Own Money Several Times, Wins
Suit tor Payment.
Judge Troutt. in a written opinion
given yesterday, sustains the law that
a note given as a promise for pay
ment of a gambling debt is not a valid
debt. William Schmalz, who sued H.
T. Brickell for $2705 04, is the con
structive loser by the decision, al
though Brickell is really out $250,
which he dropped in a crap game in
October, 1903. The plaintiff is a
pawnbroker. The game was played ln
a room adjoining his shop, which was
occupied by his sub-tenant, named
Peters, the banker of the game. When
the dice began to roll Brickell had
$250 of his own money. When that
was gone he rapped on the partition
and asked for a loan from the pawn
broker. Schmalz borrowed the money
which Brickell had lost from the
banker and took a due bill. This
process was repeated several times
during four or five hours and Brickell
borrowed his original capital enough
times to run the total up to $2600, for
which he was asked to give a prom
issory note. Then he refused to pay
and was sued for the principal and in
terest. As a defense Brickell set up
the law against gambling and against
debts contracted in play as against
public policy and good morals. The
law specifically provides that money
lent or advanced at the time or place
of the betting shall not be a legal
debt.

The Collector acted upon a telegram
from the Collector at El Paso, notify

passed inadvertently without exami

their broker that the baggage men

by customs inspectors at El Paso, and

Collector at that point had denied
that such had been done.
