ploughed along the ties for fifty yards.
Striking a guard rail, the wheels again

Investigation by the train crew
showed that a brake rod pin had been
placed in a frog in such position that

been to derail the train. It could not
have been dropped there by a passing

end under a tie and the other extend

a wheel and throw it off the track on
the Fide toward the deep gulch, across

"The stranger said, 'Don't you think it would be better for
you to leave town before the investigation proceeds further?'
"He continued to say that if I did so 1 would have $1500
put into my hand. I asked him right out who he was speaking
for. and said I would like to know who he was doing business for.
He replied that if I took the money and got out it didn't matter
who it was that furnished the money, and as long as I took the
â¢ motiey and got out T needn't know more.
"Fie went as far as the car house and returned with me to
Kearny street, speaking to me between the times that I was at
tending to my duty. Before getting off the c^r he said he would
come to the house to see me. ] told him thai $1500 was a small
sum for a man to give up his family and honor tor. I trieft to lead
him on and see what he would do. I hoped to arrange it so he
would hand me the money before witnesses. 1 have not seen the
stranger since.
"Up in the neighborhood where I live there have been lots of
rumors of threats against me â that I would get done up. People
have warned me not to go to certain places." â Charles E. Merrill.
Charles E. Merrill, the election officer on whose testimony the indict
ment of Public Works Commissioner Maestretti was based chiefly, has a
startling tale to relate of "gang methods" to prevent him from appearing
in court against the accused. He declares that he was offered $1500 to leave
the State and that nrnre lately threats have been made to intimidate him.
The identity of the men who have approached him is unknown, how
ever. Merrill says he- did not recognize any of them and it is therefore
a difficult matter to fix responsibility. He told his story to Foreman An
drews of the Grand Jury last night, but Andrews refused to state whether
steps would be taken to investigate the matter.
Merrill was an election officer in the Seventy-third precinct at thfe
primaries last August. It was there that Charles Wyman and Adolph'
Steffens voted illegally, of which offense they have been convicted. The
statement of Merrill to the Grand Jury was in effect that Maestretti had
come to him with a request that he testify that Wyman voted only once.
In the attempt to prevent him from giving this incriminating testimony
in court, Merrill now says, his life is being made miserable. The offer of
money was made only once. Merrill tried to arrange for a second in
terview for the purpose of laying a trap, but the stranger who made the
offer failed to keep the appointment.
STRANGER APPROACHED HIM ON CAR.
Merrill is a gripman on the Sacramento-street line, and he says that a
man whom he had never seen before boarded his car at the ferry last
Wednesday evening and engaged in conversation with him. The stranger
opened a discussion of the indictment that had been returned that after
noon. He rode to the end of the line and, on the return trip, said there
was "SISOO in It" if the gripman would leave the State. Merrill answered
that he wanted to think the proposition over and asked the stranger to see
him again. But the plan of the gripman to have the man identified and
entrapped failed, because he did not show up again.
Following is the statement made by Merrill:
"The papers have been after me and I have been put in a wrong light,
and I want to put myself right in this matter. I am a gripman on the
Sacramento-street car line. On the same evening that I grave my testi
mony before the Grand Jury, the same day Maestretti was indicted, a man
got on my car at the ferry. It was about 7:30. He was well dressed. He
got to talking about the case and said that it was very unfortunate that I
got mixed up in it.
"The stranger said: 'Don't you think it would be better for you to leave
town before the investigation proceeds further?'
"He continued to say that If I did so I would have $1500 put into my
hand.
"I asked him right out for whom he was speaking, and said I would like
to know for whom he was doing business. He replied that if I took the money
and got out it didn't matter who it was that furnished the money, and as
long as I took it and got out I needn't know more.
GRIPMAN'S ATTEMPT TO LAY TRAP FAILS.
"He went as far as the carhouse and returned with me to Kearny street
speaking to me between the times that I was attending to my duty. Before
getting off the car he said he would come to the house to see me. I told him
that $1500 was a small sum for a man to give up his family and honor for
I tried to lead him on and see what he would do. I hoped to arrange it so he
would hand me money before witnesses. He said that no matter where I
went it would start me in business.
"I have not seen the stranger since he rode with me. Since then five and
six people have been coming to my house daily to see me, until we have rÂ»
fused to open the door.
"The man who approached me on the car was prosperous lookine I
had seen him before, but where I cannot remember. I see so many faces dur
ing a day that it is hard to remember where I have seen a person before
"The man was short, heavy set, had a brown mustache, was about 46
years of age, well dressed, substantial looking and wore a stiff black hat and
long overcoat.
"He asked me so many questions that I did not know but that on their
aide the Grand Jury or the District Attorney had put up a plan to try me
"When I got appointed to the Election Board I was put down as one of
Maestretti's hirelings and was put in a bad light by the papers. I have been
in Countryman's office but once, and then I went there with my wife. Coun
tryman called meetings of the election officers with Maestretti, but I never
attended one of them.

threats against me â that I would get done up. People have warned me not
to go to certain places.
"When the man got on the car he first asked me if my name was Merrill,
and spoke of Steffens and Wyman.
"The papers looked on me as one of Maestretti's gangsters. I hardly
know him. I want to be put right. I know Adolph Steffens. and I went as
far as I conscientiously could to help him.
"I called on Foreman Andrews and told him of the threats against me,
and told him also that I had been warned that it was dangerous for me to
live in the neighborhood where I reside and that the safest place for me was
out of town. I have already told of Wyman calling at my house and Maes
tretti waiting outside. I don't want to be mixed up with such a gang."

NOT ASKED TO MEDIATE.
lÂ»i-e*idcnt Roosctelt la Unaware of
rcaoe Negotiations.
WASHINGTON, March . 29.â Neither j
Kussia nor Japan has asked President j
Roosevelt to assist her in ending the
war. So far as the Washington Gov- ;
ernment is aware, Emperor Nicholas :
has not yet weakened in his decision
\to prosecute the war to the bitter j
end."
The genuine wish of this Government !
lor peace in the Far East is not based
upon seitish interests. American finan- j
ciers have not overloaded themselves,
â  with bonds of either of the belligerent
â¢ nations. Washington believes that it is j
to the advantage of both belligerents
that the Far East war come to a j
speedy end, and anything that this
trovernment can do to bring that about
will be done gladly; but it Is authorita
tively stated that no official of the
Washington Government is ambitious
to pose as the mediator between the
Czar and the Mikado.
It is the feeling here that Russia and
Japan should negotiate directly and
avoid an international conference. This
â¢pinion also prevails in Berlin. Indeed,
Japan has recently received an urgent
warning against indirect negotiations, '
lest they lead to an international con
ference, the results of which might
prove disastrous to the interests of
both belligerents.
There is authority for the statement
that France is diligently striving to end
the war and for cix weeks past negoti
ations of the most confidential charac
ter have been in progress between
Paris and St. Petersburg. . Even diplo
mats of the highest rank have failed to :
obtain from Delcasse, the French Min
ister, the results of the negotiation*.
but it is announced on the same au-' '
thoriry that Count Lamsdorff, the Rus
sian Minister for Foreign Affairs, has
â within a week admitted that he had in
a general way outlined to Delcasse the
terms along which Russia might con
sent to consider peace.
Advices from Europe tell of the fear
prevalent there in certain quarters that '
the activities of Lamsdorff and 1 Del
caffse are directed toward an interna
tional conference, to be held in some
neutral European capital, such as
Stockholm, where peace negotiations
might be conducted. It Is said that this
move has been in a measure blocked ')
by th* re fusal of Japan to give any In- j
dication as 'to the peace terms' she '
v ould accept until positively assured in
the name of the Czar himself that Rus
sia is prepared to negotiate in good
faith for peace. Not only does Japan
insist upon this assurance, but she
prefers to. negotiate directly with St. '
Petersburg.
With the United States, Germany
and Japan opposed to an international
conference to end the war, the belief is '
strong in Washington that successful
peace negotiations will date from the i
day St. Petersburg communicates with
Tofcto direct. The Washington Govern- ;
ment is already watching for the op- ;
portunity to assist Russia and Japan !

RIGOROUS PEACE TERMS.
Japan Is Said to Demand $800,000,000
Indemnity.
PARIS. March 29. â All the official
information relative to peace is of a
negative nature. At the same time
the â >rficia: view is now strongly opti
mistic that peace is not far diÃtant.
This view is not due to exact informa
tion, but is the result of a settled con
viction that peace is the only logical
ovtcoÃW of Russia's present predica
ment. However, the Foreign Office re
fuses to credit the various reports that
Fiance is taking: a hand in the nego
tiations or preliminaries and specific
ally denies the report from a northern
capital that Russia has asked Foreign
Minister Delcasse to act as intermedi
ary.
Another report prominently displayed
in the Echo de Paris in-day says the
United States "is about tv make a
coup de theater by initiating peace."
This likewise is not credited in high
quarters, as letters just received from
Embassador McCormick say Russia
has not made any advances through
him.
.Although official information is lack
ing, it is asserted in well informed
quarters that Japan has permitted
Russia to learn that the peace condi
tions will be rigorous and will not be
responsive to the recent sentimental
plea to Japan's magnanimity. In par
ticular, it is said that Japan's indem
nity figure is $100,000,000 and that this
stupendous sum has proved so stagger
ing to Russian diplomacy that it is the
chief cause why the peace preliminaries
do not advance y< a decisive stage.
BILDERLIXCS'S BLUNDER.
Kiiropatkin's Plan of Retreat Upset by
Subordinate.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 30. .1:50
a. m. â An interesting fact throwing
light on the supersession of General
Bilderling from the command of the
Third Manchurian Army haa been
brought out by a Russian dispatch
from Gunfchu Pass, describing the re
treat from Mukden. According to the
plan of retreat as outlined each divi
sion of the Third Army was to have
retired by the Mandarin road and roads
to the eastward of that highway. In
stead it moved for some reason along
roads to the west of" the Mandarin
road, leaving a breach between the
First and Third armies, of which the
Japanese took advantage.
The correspondent says the wagon
trains were ordered north three days
before the evacuation, but their de
parture was delayed, causing confu
sion in the withdrawal.
Discussing the battle of Sandepu the
correspondent says he personally saw
a map made from observation by a
balloon on January 20, showing the re
doubt al Randepu on which the attack
wax shattered, but of the existence of
which the attacking force first learned
during the attack â "an unimportant
detail, but one which cost us 10.000
men and the success of the opera
tion."

ST. PETERSBURG, March 29. â
Russian fours took a further sharp
decline to-day to 83Vi. closing 2>4
points below yesterdays low mark.
Other Government securities and in
dustrials suffered in sympathy and
there was much excitement on the
Bourse, though traders retained thefr
heads in thp face of the fall. The de
cline in the price of fours' was man
ifest in the opening quotations and
the bonds remained steady at fhe low
point throughout the day, being
slightly firmer at the close.
Among other Government securi
ties the Government's first lottery
loan fell 4H points, to 381, and the
second lottery loan 2 points to 303,
while Southwestern Railways, guaran

STOPPED BY THE SMOLENSK.
Steamship Dragoman Forced by Rus
sian Shot to Halt.
BOSTON, March 29.â The steam
ship Dragoman, which arrived here
to-day from Manila and Cebu, reports
having been chased by the Russian
volunteer cruiser Smolensk while on
the way from Batoum with a cargo of
petroleum for Nagasaki and Kobe.
The Smolensk approached the
Dragoman within hailing distance and
ordered the steamship to follow her.
Captain Owens of the Dragoman re
fused, whereupon the warship flred
two shots across, the steamship's bow
and the Dragoman lay to. A boat was
sent from the cruiser to the steamship
prepared to take charge of the vessel
but the presentation by Captain
Owens of a bill of lading naming
Shanghai as hig destination seemed to
satisfy the officer in charge of the

Claim Is Again Made That

HARBIN, March 29. â There has
been no fighting of consequence
lately. Reconnaissances establish the
fact that the Japanese are gather
ing in strong force twenty miles
south of Slpinghai, evidently intending
to attack the Russian position at Sip
inghai. The Russians are strongly for
tifying there and apparently expect to
make a stand. The country is compar
atively clear of Japanese.
The Japanese are approaching Kirin,
threatening communication in the Us
suri district.
The number of Chinese bandits is
constantly augmenting.
Chinese continue to report that Field
Marshal Oyama has issued proclama
tions fixing the date for the occupation
<>f Harbin as April 10, but this predic
tion, if actual, is apparently improbable
of fulfillment.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 30, 2:30
a m. â Another duel between the op
posing armies in Manchuria may be on
the programme for the coming week.
The Russians, according to a Harbin
< "rrespondent, are now strongly forti
fying their positions at Sipinghai,
against which tho Japanese are report
ed to be gathering in force. The re
ported Russian retirement from Sip
inghai to Chaoumiaodzi was incorrect,
due to a telegraphic error in the con
fusion of similar Chinese nameÃ, Cha
oumiaodzi with Shuamuyaotsi, south
of Sipinghai, whence the Russian ad
vanced force retired to the fortified line
at Sipinghai. The Japanese followed
to some extent, but a border of twenty
miles of debatable ground still remains
between the two armies, over which
the Japanese probably will, not advance
until they are ready to attack.
Equally important news is that a
column of Japanese is moving against
Kirin, perhaps with the intention of
turning the position eastward and
striking at the Vladivostok line of com
munication with the double purpose of
isolating the fortress and separating
General Lanevltch's army from a val
uable base of supplies, the Ussuri dis
tiict.
PFRIL OF TACOMA'S CREW.
Barely Escape? Death in the Ice Floes
Off Hokkaido.
YOKOHAMA, March 29.â The crew of
the steamship Tacoma, owned by the
Northwestern Commercial Steamship
company of Seattle, which was cap
tured by the Japanese on March 14
north of the island of Hokkaido, ar
rived here to-day and were released.
â¢ They tell a graphic story of their ad
ventures in the ice floes from Febru
ary 4 to March 14.
The Tacoma left Seattle at midnight
on January 5 and on January 14
reached Dutch Harbor, where she
coaled. On February 4 the vessel be
came helplessly icebound north of Hok
kaido Island and was seriously threat
ened by the heavy ice packs which
crashed and pounded against her sides
with a report that could be heard for
miles. The decks and rigging were
covered by hundreds of tons of ice.
The crew expected that the vessel
would be crushed and made sleds so
as to be prepared to seek land.
The supply of coal ran short and the
fires were put out, which resulted in
many of the crew nearly to
death. Provisions also ran short and
the cargo of beef had to be broached.
On March 11 the Tacoma drifted in
ihe midst of an ice floe only a half
mile from the dangerous rocks near
which the British steamship Mars
stranded a few days later.
On March 14 the Tacoma encoun
tered a Japanese warship by which she
was seized.

PAID SALARY
FOR NO WORK
ALBANY, N. V., March 29.â Frank
P. Ball, the Dunkirk ticket broker) al
legred to have been placed in the Fre
donia postofnee through the influence
of Justice Hooker, testified to-day be
fore the Assembly Judiciary Commit
tee, which is investigating the charges
against Justice Hooker.
Ball said that, although he had done
no work at the Fredonia postoffl.ee, he
had received $2533. Practically all of
this, he said, was used to repay the
wife of Judge Hooker, who had en
dorsed a note for him. JLater he re
turned every dollar of the amount he
had received to the postmaster at Fre
donia, who had been ordered to refund
it to the Government.
Ball testified that he was notified by
Postmaster Taylor that he had received
an order from the department to repay
to the Government all the money that
had been paid to Ball as salary. In
the same month Ball gave a note to
Taylor for $2500 and a check for the
remainder of the money.
It was developed by the evidence that
three men, one a newspaper man of
New York city, and the two others
hostile to Justice Hooker, had at
tempted to corrupt the testimony of
Ball by assuring him that he would
not have to pay the $2500 note, and
that they would furnish a lawyer at
their expense to defend any suits that
might be brought as the result of the
non-payment of the note if he would
disclose evidence which they believed
he possessed in regard to Judge
Hooker. Ball declined to enter into any
agreement to injure Hooker.

B^e an article in relation to Japanese
immigration to the United States and
to say what steps, if any, are imposed
by the Government of Japan upon the
emigration of its subjects to this coun

"I beg to state that my Government,
in appreciation of the sentiment which
has found expression from time
'to time in the United States op
posing further immigration of Jap
anese laborers; has gone so far as to
positively prohibit it. With a view to
the enforcement of this regulation the
authorities are prohibited from issuing
passports to laborers desiring to enter
the United States, and such care Is
exercised in the enforcement of this
prohibition that the police make spe
cial investigations to determine the
status of persons suspected of belong
i ing to the laboring class before pass-
I ports are issued."

LOCAL CAPITAL
RUNS TO LOAN
Subscriptions in this city for the new
Japanese loan were made yesterday to
the amount of $3,650,000, or $1,150,000 in
excess of the amount that was reported
to be allotted to the Pacific Coast. The
subscriptions began promptly at 10:30,
the hour announced for the beginning.
Investors were early in evidence at
both the Nevada Natioal^Bank and at
th^ Anglo-Californian Bank, which
were authorized to handle the loan on
the Pacific Coast. The allotment of
$2,500,000 was all taken within an hour.
Telegraphic dispatches were received
from the East at noon, giving informa
tion that the Eastern subscriptions had
been so large that it had. been decided
to close the taking of subscriptions
there at 3 o'clock this afternoon, in
stead of continuing to the time first
set for the closing, namely, on April
5. The same will be done here.
The sum of $2,000,000 was subscribed
within a very short time, less than half
an hour, after the opening of the local
banks. The subscriptions ranged from
as low as $350 to thousands of dollars.
The record in this city was broken.
New York asked that San Francisco
might give up some of the share of the
loan allotted to it, but the subscrip
tions had already been taken. Prob
ably subscriptions will be received
through interior California banks and
also from Washington and Oregon to
day.
The Japanese loan is for $150,000,000.
The principal and interest are both
made a first charge on the revenues of
the Imperial Japanese Government to
bacco monopoly. The rate of interest
is 4Â»2 per cent.
BIG DEMAND FOR BONDS.
Investors Besiege Merchants' Nation-
al Bank at Los 'Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, March 29.â Within
the three hours that subscriptions to
the Japanese loan were open to-day
capitalists, other banks and big cor
porations looking for investment ap
plied to he Farmers' and Merchants'
National Bank for Â£85,000, and after
the bank closed for the day telegrams
and letters were received asking for
Â£20,000 more. Most of the applica
tions came from the country banks,
one Pasadena bank asking for $75,
000, and a Riverside bank for a sim
ilar amount. The amount subscribed
by local capitalists is in excess of
$250,000 and so great was the demand
for portions of the loan that the bank
here had to telegraph to San Fran
cisco to ascertain the extreme limit to
which it could take subscriptions. A
Salt Lake capitalist asked for $150,
000 and offered his personal check for
the amount, offering to pay a prem
ium if that amount of the bonds was
given to him, but his offer was 1 re
fused. Acting upon instructions from
San Francisco, the bank here an
nounced that it would close subscrip
tions at noon to-morrow and that it
â would accept offers of only $25,000 ot
over. If the allotment to Los Ange
les amounted to Â£200.000 it could
easily be taken.
BIG DEMANDS ELSEWHERE.
Japanese Loan Heavily Oversub
scribed in New York and Ix>ndon.
LONDON, March 29. â The issuing
banks estimate that the Japanese loan
haa been oversubscribed at least ten
times. They think the foreign appli
cations alone fully cover the whole
amount.
CHICAGO, March 29.â Chicago in
a few hours to-day subscribed for
$15,000,000 of the new Japanese war
loan. Subscriptions were received at
the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank
and at the Merchants' Loan and Trust
Bank. The subscription books here
close to-morrow at 2 o'clock p. m.
NEW YORK, March 29. â The new
Japanese loan was heavily oversub
scribed here.

his room and the nearest one passed
directly in front of the door of the
room occupied by the detectives. Zim
merman chose the longest hallway, but
had grone a very little way before the
three detectives were on him. Taylor,
with revolver drawn, sprang at him and
with one arm pressed him against the
wall. Dinan and Wren each caught a
hand and before he could move, the
handcuffs were on his wrists.
As he leaped upon him Taylor said,
"Zimmerman, if you move I'll kill yuu."
Zimmerman replied, "1 give up. l was
expecting this would happen." He was
immediately taken to the Hall of Jus
tice, but refused to make any state
ment about his own movements or
<>f Collins. After being identified
by Daly and Roche he was given into
the custody of Sheriff Veale.
The Sheriff and hiii prisoner, together
with W. G. Palmanteer, vice president
<>f the Central Bank, and Detective
Dinan, entered a cab and were driven
around town for an hour before going
to thÂ» ferry. During that time another
attempt was made by threats and ca
jollery to rndke Zimmerman taiK. but it
w as Unsuccessful.
While Zimmerman was being con
veyed to Martinez the detectives ran
sacked his room. On the prisoner's
si had been found $35 in gold and
1135 in hills, and a gold Waltham
watch with a leather fob, the gold band
on v. hich bore the inscriptions, "From
C Carter, L.ockport. N. V., to F. C. M.'
and "Fred." A triangular topazz was
attached to the fob. Zimmerman had
recently bought a trunk, as though
preparing for a journey, and the cloth
ing he wore on the day of the holdup
v. as found and identified by Daly and
Roche. <>n opening the trunk the first
article found was a handsome Colts 45
caliber revolver. This weapon was im
mediately recognized by the police, it
having been taken from him when
Zimmerman was in custody before.
Attached to the revolver was a small
I>arkage of cartridges of the same cali
ber. A white-handled knife with a com
bination blade, containing a file and a
=lw. was also found, and the police de
clare it an ideal tool for prying win
dows.
IMPORTANT LETTER.
The most important find was made by
Detective Reynolds. The rough draft
of a letter, evidently sent Tuesday,
was found in a magazine. It is ad
dressed to "Tom," presumably Collins.
It is couched in meaning terms and il
lustrates the cunning of the writer. It
reads:
"Tomâ Write to inform you that I
did not start to-day (Tuesday) because
the dentist is not finished, but he ex
pects to relieve me from torture to-day
or Wednesday morning. I will be all
ready on Wednesday evening, 29th.
"The: weather here is getting finer
every day, and I look forward for a
good crop. I have already put about
one-fourth of my alfalfa In a dry place.
The forecaster thinks the storm has
gone E&at. I will try if possible to
leave, river. Wed. eve. You can figure
up on the time table. Hoping this will
I find you in good health and spirits, I
remain yours, ZIM."
The second paragraph is interpreted
by the police to mean that the writer
believes the police less active, that he
has hidden part of the plunder and that
the police are looking for him and Col
lins in the East. The many crossings
out and re writings indicate that the
letter was being written according to
"code" and this was but the rough
draft of a communication that was sent
by Zimmerman.
The proprietor at 321 Ellis street said
that Zimmerman and Collins applied
for rooms December 31. Zimmerman
gave the name of Kimmerman, and was
thought to be a lawyer, while Collins
kept his own name and posed as a
business man. Their hours were very

hold-up. Among those who knew of j
the plan was Charles Henry, alias Mul
cahey, now at the Broadway jail,
awaiting transportation to Folsom to
serve fourteen years for burglary.
When told Of the robbery by a Pinker
ton man he uttered an exclamation of
surprise and regret, and it is believed
that the gang proceeded with the work
without his consent. He said that he
knew who did the job, but has steadily
refused to implicate his pals. ,
The first information pointing to
Zimmerman and Collins came to the
Pinkertons from a stableman in Oak
land. He was working at a stable near
the Central Bank and saw Zimmerman
and Collins watching Daly carry the
coin from the bank and place it in the
buggy. Zimmerman had often been
seen watching the bank and the stable
man knew him, as both worked at the
oil works in Point Richmond.
Collins and Zimmerman were also ap
prehended through the statement of a
woman who overheard them talking in
a saloon, while she was hidden behind
a slot machine. She told the police of
what she overheard and identified the
photographs of Collins and Zimmer
man.
The local police and the Sheriff's dep
uties of Contra Costa and Alameda
counties are on the alert for Collins,
with every prospect of finding him.
The Pinkerton men have been with
drawn from the case, as that office is
certain that the capture of Collins is
only a matter of a few hours.
OAKLAND, March 29. â The center
of interest in the Stege Crossing rob
bery was transferred across the bay
to-day with the news of Zimmerman's
arrest. Early as possible W. G. Pal
manteer. vice president of the Central
Bank; John E. Daly and Frank K.
Roche were sent to the Hall of Jus
tice, where Daly's absolute identifica
tion of the prisoner as the toiler of
the Stege highwaymen settled mat
ters.
The Oakland authorities have not
been advised that there is any suspi
cion of Collins being in this city or
on this side of the bay. The theory
obtains here that the missing man's
whereabouts is known to Zimmerman
and that a way will be found to induce
the prisoner to talk.
The officials of the Central Bank to
day issued the following:
During the preliminary investigation into the
details of the robbery the officers of the cen
tral Bank stated that a reward would be paid
for the apprehension and conviction of the
parties who perpetrated the Stege robbery
This has now been arranged, and a reward of
(1000 will be pa.id for the arrest and convic
tion of the parties who robbed J. E. Daly and
Frank Roche near Stege Station, Contra Costa
County, Cal., and an additional $1000 will be
paid for the return of the (9000 stolen or a
pro rata amount of the (1000 will be paid for
the amount recovered.
This reward will be paid 'through the Cali
fornia Bankers' Association, according to the
above conditions.
Vice President Palmanteer to-night
went to Martinez with Sheriff Veale
and Zimmerman.
THINKS HE HAS COLLINS.
Kern Oonnty Sheriff Arrests Man Who
Looks Like Stege Robber.
BAKERSFfELD, March 29. â It
was stated to-day at the Sheriff's of
fice in this city that there is a, strong
possibility that in the arrest of a man
giving the name of Mike Kelly the
officers have unknowingly captured
Thomas A. Collins, the man who is
â wanted In Oakland for the robbery of
the Central Bank messengers, Daly
and Roche.
Kelly was arrested yesterday on
suspicion of having been implicated
in the murder of an unknown man in
Kern City Sunday morning. When he
was brought to the jail Steve Price,
the jailer, immediately noticed a
strong resemblance between him and
the picture of Collins he had seen in
a San Francisco paper. So striking
was the resemblance that the jailer
communicated his suspicions to Sher
iff Kelly. The prisoner was brought
before the Sheriff, and while he was
undergoing a close scrutiny he was
plainly ill at ease.
In order to observe the actions of
the man. after a prolonged examina
tion, the Sheriff said: "That is the
man, Steve; take him back." Kelly
gave a quick start and turned notice
ably pale. He was much agitated as
he was led back to his cell. He ques
tioned the jailer closely in his ef
forts to determine the identity of
Sheriff Kelly, but was given no sat
isfaction.
A request for pictures and a de
tailed description of Collins has been
sent to San Francisco and Oakland by
the Sheriff's office.
FIND COATS OF ROBBERS.
Boy Directs Frank BHtton to Vacant
Lot Where Garments Lie.
OAKLAND, March 29. â Two coats,
believed to have been those worn by
the robbers, Zimmerman and Collins,
were found yesterday, carefully hid
den under a clump of bushes in a va
cant lot on Golden Gate avenue, near
the Deaf, Dumb stnd Blind Institute
in Berkeley. They were found by a
boy, whose name is unkno.wn, and in
the pocket of one of them was found a
mask like those worn by the high
waymen. One of the coats is a black
cutaway of rough cheviot and the
other square cut and of gray material.
The boy, not realizing the value of his
discovery, threw the garments aside
after searching the pockets, but later
told Frank Britton, a cement worker,
of his find and Britton recovered the
coats and now has them at his home.
He searched for the mask which the
boy said he had taken from the pocket
of one of the garments, but could not
find it.
TEN YOUNGSTERS CONFESS
TO A SCORE OF ROBBERIES
Loot Stores in a Suburb of Chicago
and Secure Candy and
Gum.
GHICAGO, March 29. â Ten boys of
Harvey, a suburban town, have con
fessed in the Juvenile Court to the rob
bery of eighteen stores, three churches,
two schoolhouses and a railroad sta
tion. The plunder consisted of candy,
glim and pennies and it was too free
distribution of the candy at school that
at last enabled the police to capture
the band, which had led them a merry
chase for months.
"We started it just for fun," sobbed
one of the culprits, "but when we got
into it we could not stop. We just had
to go right on stealing because there
was always some boy that dW not
have what he 'wanted."
Stamps costing $19,500 were recently
required for an agreement between
two London railway companies.

Requests the Members of
the Commission to Tender
Their Resignations to Him
THEY PROMPTLY
ACT AS DIRECTED
Chief Executive Wants Clear
Field to Name New Body
of Ken to Dig the Big
Ditch Down on the Isthmus
WASHINGTON, March 29.â The first
practical step having in view the re
organization of the Panama Canal
Commission was taken to-day, when,
in compliance with instructions from
President Roosevelt, Secretary Taft re
quested the members of the commission
to tender their resignations. This re
quest was promptly complied with by
the members of the commission now in
Washington and their resignations will
be placed in the hands of the Presi
dent to-morrow. The contents of Taft's
letter requesting the resignations of the
commissioners were made known to
Major-General George \V. Davis, Gov
ernor of the canal zone, who is also
one of the members of the commission,
and a prompt answer is expected from
him.
As indicated in the letter of Secre
tary Taft, the resignations are request
ed in order that the President may
have a free hand in reorganizing the
commission. That the President has
contemplated the reorganization has
been known for some time, and he has
been in consultation with Secretary
Taft as to his future policy in choos
ing its personnel and directing its
work. It was believed originally that
better results might be accomplished
by the appointment of a smaller com
mission than that now existing, but
a recent opinion of Attorney- General
Moody held that under the 'aw the
President is required to name seven
members in all. The appointments
probably will be announced during the
progress of his Southern trip.
The members of the present commis
sion, in addition to General Davis, are
Rear Admiral John H. Walker of the
navy, retired, chairman; William Bar
clay Parsons, William H. Burr, Benja
min M. Harrod and C. E. Grunsky.

tul: value of charcoal.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
In Preserving Health and Beauty.
.Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal Is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier In nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system. 'â¢â¢-;:
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables â 
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic- ,
It absorbs the injurious Â£&ses which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
Ail druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best i
charcoal and- the most for the money
Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges;- they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozengere. the charcoal being mixed
with honey. â  , â 
The daily use of these lozenges will
coon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood
and the beauty of it is, that no pos-
sible harm caw result from their con-
tinued use. but on the contrary 'great
benefit. ~ . '
A Buffalo ' physician In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I d-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
era bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents' a box
st drug, stores," Â«nd although In .some
pense a patent preparation,' yet â¢ I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in any
of the ordinary charcoal â tablets.-" I**1 ** lv

Alaska Will Give a Compre
liensi ye Display of Her
Resources at Portland
Spec!*! Dispatch to ThÂ«Â» Cm.l!.
PORTLAND. March 29â The Alaskan
exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Expo
sition will be more complete and in
teresting than that ai St. Louis. Gov
ernor John G. Brady of the District
of Alaska, who is executive commis
sioner, i? at present in Alaska arrang
ing for additions to be made to the
exhibit which will serve to make i.
materially more instructive.
Alaska is paying considerable atten
tion t- the Centennial, inasmuch as the
enterprise is distinctly Western and the
people of the district feel that they are
now afforded their best opportunity to
exploit the country. In consequence
of this, a liberal display of large and
valuable gold nuggets, representing one
of the principal resources of Alaska,
will be made, a. feature which was
lacking somewhat' in the St. Louis Ex
position. The marble display at St.
Louis was awarded a gold medal, but
the exhibit at Portland will be larger
and more comprehensive, and the same
may be said of the tin, coal and other
mineral displays.
Five carloads of Alaskan exhibits
have already arrived, and these will
be installed as sonn as is practicable.
Of the various exhibits, there will be
one of totem poles, characteristic of
the peculiar sculpture of the Alaskan
Indians, and this should arouse un
usual interest among the visitors. The
intention is to have the poles ar
raneed in a circle just south of the
Alaskan wing of the Government builcl
ing. An Indian dugout, fifty-four feet
long, will be fic-ated upon Guilds Lake.
Aside from the mineral displays and
those of archaelogical and geological
research, Alaska will make a very
thorough exhibit of its agricultural
and natural resources. Forestry, graz
ing and fishing industries will "also be
represented with creditable displays.
The Alaskan educational exhibit will
include displays from the various edu
cational institutions for white people
and also from the Government free
schools for Indians. Transparent pho
tographs depicting Alaskan scenes will
be shown upon the windows of the
building. The great topographical map
of the District of Alaska, explaining
the resour'fs and character of the va
rious section.- which proved a popular
feature at the Â£*. Louis Exposition, will
be included in the exhibit at Port
land. Gilded blocks exemplifying the
size and value of the annual produc
tion of the famous Treadwell mine,
representing in round figures, $22,000.
000. will also be shown. As a whole,
the Alaskan exhibit at the Lewis and

CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. March 29. -Secretary
Taft tci-day announced that William
Nelson Cromwell, counsel for the Pan
ama Railroad Company, had rendered
an invaluable service to the Govern
ment in obtaining for it 275 shares of
the outstanding stock of the Panama
Railroad Company. This gives the Gov
ernment entire control of the railroad,
whereas until Cromwell purchased
these shares in this country and Eu
rope there was a sufficient minority to
have combated the applications for an
injunction and the receivership efforts
of the United States to conduct tht
road according to its own interests as
chief stockholder. '
The sub-committee of the Interstate
and Foreign Commerce Committee of
the House of Representatives which in
vestigated the Panama Railroad com
mended its management as conspicu
ously able, businesslike and progressive,
and recommended that the United
States obtain the ownership of the en
tire stock. By extreme effort and at
some expense Cromwell obtained 270
out of the shares outstanding. Th^
Government nnw holds 728 shares. He
holds the contract of the owner of the
last five shares to deliver them upon
his return from Europe.
Cromwell has delivered the 270 shares
to Taft, and his offer carries with it an
irrevocable proxy to the Government
should any limitation be found as to
the Government's power to acquire the
stock.
Secretary Taft. who considers this
transaction one of the most important
yet performed in connection with the
canal construction, has written to
Cromwell, saying:
'â¢I cannot exaggerate the importance
to the Government of securing all
shares of the stock, and therefore I ten
der to you cm behalf of the President
and myself our sincere thanks for the
very great rapidity and success with
which you have brought about this
much desired result. I cannot fail to
note your patriotism and unselfishness
I in not permitting me to hand you, as I
might reasonably do, a substantial sum
iin compensation for your services,
which have been of such great value to
the Government."
This transaction gives to the Govern
ment not only the entire control of the
railroad, which is an indispensable
factor in the construction of the- canal,
but also of a steamship line from New-
York which is owned by the railroad
company.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
has been given notice that its contract
with the Panama Railroad for trans
portation from Panama, the Pacific
terminal of the canal, to San Francisco
will terminate on July 12.
MORE TROUBLE
ON THE SOLACE
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
VALLEJO, March 29.â The proverbial
bull in the china shop did not cause
more of a rumpus than did Captain J.
Bull of the United State* navy trans- !
port Solace and Lieutenant Commander
J. J. Knapp on the last voyage of the
ship from Manila to San Francisco. The
refusal of Captain" Bull to allow the
wife of Warrant Machinist Costello of
the Cavite naval station the use of
the deck with the other passengers be
cause her husband was not of sufficient
rank is the cause of much bitterness
in tho naval colony on Mare Island and
the end is not yet.
The Solace has been at Mare Island
na\V yard for some 1 1 rile undergoing
repairs and the friction which was
caused between several of the petty of
ficers of the ship and Captain Bull and
Lieutenant Commander Knapp through
the Cdsttllo incident is on the increase.
The ships physician, Dr. Frederick J. <
Cordiero, who went to Captain Bull
and protested against the treatment ac
corded Mrs. Costello is now suffering j
ten days' confinement to his room !
aboard the ship for alleged infraction
of navy regulations. Mrs. Cordiero is i
not allowed to see her husband.
Dominlck Glynn. chief boatswain of \
the Solace, is doing seven days straight
duty, contrary to navy regulations
while a ship is in port. It is said, he
neglected to salute Lieutenant Com
manaer Knapp while passing that offl- J
cor. Glynn gained considerable fame
while serving on the Charleston when
the cruiser went on a reef in the Phil
ippine, cilynn sailed 1300 miles in an
open boat and obtained relief for the
stranded crew of his ship.
There are several other officers
aboard ship who were veryS^ndignant
over the treatment accorded Mrs. Cos
tello and they are dally expecting to be
' put under hatches" as punishment for
opposing the stand taken by their exec

MRS. MAYBRICK
ON THE STAND
WASHINGTON, March 29.â The tes
timony of Mrs. Florence Maybrick in
the taking of depositions in the case ot
her mother, Baroness yon Rogues,
against David W. Armstrong and oth
ers, involving valuable tracts of lands
in Virginia, West Virginia and Ken
tucky, was concluded to-day.
Mrs. displayed marked ca
pacity for avoiding direct answers to
the rigid questioning to which she was
subjected. She declared with respect
to the signing of certain papers in
prison that she simply signed the docu
ments without any clear knowledge of
the transaction. Upon being pressed
for a more direct answer, Mrs. May
brick insisted that when she signed the
papers she did not know the nature of
their contents.
The defendant produced a number of
letters said to have been written by her
mother, Consul Potter and others be
fore and during her imprisonment, bui
she expressed her inability to identify
the handwriting of any one sixteen
years ago.
"The impression of my mothers
handwriting prior to my release," she
said, "is too dim fbr me to identify
definitely any letter."
She would not state even to the best
of her knowledge and belief that the
letter shown her had been written by
her mother, saying that a statement of
that kind would be too definite.
Counsel for the plaintiff objected to a
question as to whether Mrs. Maybrick
had received a pardon from the British
Government, but the witness neverthe
less cautiously replied that she had pa
pers in her possession given her by the
British Government. Asked if she were
willing to produce them, Mrs. May
brick replied with equal caution that
they could be produced only at the re
quest of the American Government.
On redirect examination Mrs. May
brick detailed the circumstances under
which she acquired an interest in the
property in dispute, saying that at her
marriage her mother gave her as a
gift one-third of her property interest
in Kentucky. Virginia and West Vir
ginia and later assigned the same in
writing. The deed and assignment,
said Mrs. Maybrick, had been confirm
ed repeatedly by her mother up to the
present day by word of mouth.
"That. 1 " she said, "is the agreement
that now exists between us," and she
smilingly left the stand.

that the blow should not be struck at

Increased In membership to fifteen. In order
that all section* of New England may be rep

tmraber throughout the country, both Inside
m.nd without the Congregational church. More
and more representative men are coming over
to our e:dÂ« The matter is not settled by any
tccans.
An abstract of the report of the sub
committee of the American Board of
Commissioners for Foreign Missions
reads as follows:
For almost a century the board haj re
ceived rifts from every quarter In America.
in receiving gifts from these varied sources
the board ha* in no degree and in no way
passed judgment on the religion, character or
UfÂ« cf the donor*. In this policy we have
followed the tmlveraal custom of the past,
fcr the church In all ages has received upon
Its altars the gifts of all who were moved
to lay them thereon. The came principle has
b*es followed not only by philanthropic and
educational Institutions, but by other mission
ary bodies. -' J -"''.-Â«
The principle on which this policy rest* is
the belief that our responsibility begins with
the receipt of I gift; It then becomes our
trust, for which we are to be held responsible.
We are aaked now to make an exception and
to single out this recent voluntary girt for re
fusal. It phould be stated that this rift of
El 00. COO was offered to the board and only
accepted by the prudential committee on Feb
ruary 14. It is a building and equipment fund
and is available only for the purpose named.
Of this. $91,000 has been already appropriated
er.d $41,500 hae already been forwarded.
: Tour committee sees no' reason why we
Ehotild have departed from the custom of the
bi>trd ard make our committee practically a
tribunal to decide whether Rifts are to be re
ceived. It would be manlf/-*tly unjust and
unthinkable to reject gifts without thorough
scrutiny, and it i* equally clear that no com
mittee could possibly undertake the task of
BU'h a scrutiny.
ARGUMENT FOR ACCEPTANCE.
It seems to us that It would have been an
assumption and usurpation if we had " tried
to etop any man who wished to give for mis
sionary work. The reason assigned for the
rejection of the recent gift is that gifts con
ttltute a relation of "honor' between the re
cipient and the donor. This gift was made
without conditions. Thin means that It in
volves the American board In no obligation
â¢whatever, material or moral, to the donor.
The church must make such an assumption
abcut its gifts or receive none at all. Gifts
made to the church can be accepted only on
the assumption that they are debts paid to
God and humanity and involve nothing what
fcrer in the way of favors. To aHtmmc that
enllgation iÂ» designed or contemplated is to
accuse the giver of seeking to further his own
lntercrta. and the church of being a respecter
of persons. The committee feels that Euch an
assumption concerning ftlthcr the giver or the
recipient ie unwarrantable and that they have
no right to prevent this money from doing
the work for which it has been designated.

various ways and by different protestants in
the last few daye is summed up practically In
this-: That there is a great evil In our
country; that the donor of this gift is believed
by them to be identified in a conspicuous way
with this evil, and therefore the American
board should refuse this gift in this conspicu
ous way and thus strike a blow at this evil."
We feel that the protCÃtuts hay. other ways
of making their view* known and that the blow
should not be struck at the f m nun of the
people in the non-Christian world. We Jo not
deem that any gift is made to the committee,
but simply throueh the committee to objects
for which the committee is a trustee. For
this reason, also. the. acceptance of gifts in
volves no expression of opinion on the part
of the committee as to the character of the
giver-e, and to intercept a gift made to others
in order to express an opinion for ourselves
teems unwarrantable. In common with the
protestants we are not blind to the moral
l6sue they have raised. But the committee
does not feel warranted by a refusal of gifts
to rass final judgment on questions which
have never been settled before the courts or
at the bar of public opinion.
While, therefore, we do respect most sin
cerely the conscientious convlctigni of the peti
tioners, we on our part must ask that our con
science also be respected, believing as we do
that under cur solemn obligation to care for
our trust we have no right to decline this
gift. It is obvious, therefore, that we can
take no action in order to grant the request
of the retltloners.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 29.â "There

done at once. I shall consult the au

WEDS TWICE
ON SAME DAY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 29.â According
to the Judges of the General Session,
never has such a strange case of big
amy been brought to their attention as
that of John Steffler, who pleaded
guilty to-day before Judge Newberger
to having married two young women
nn the same day. Steffler told the
court that he had no recollection of
having contracted either marriage and
could offer no explanation of his con
duct. Judge Newberger remanded him
to the Tombs for sentence and will
make an investigation into his case.
The indictment charges Steffler with
having married Estelle Deffely on Au
gust 13 last. On the evening of the
p-him* day Steffler married Hannah

INDICTED AGENT
Head of Beef Trust Says
Connors Is the Victim
of Grave Misunderstand
ing as to Facts in Case
CHICAGO, March 29.â Several wit
nesses, for the most part employes of
the Chicago packers, were heard at to
day's session of the special Grand Jury
which is investigating the business
transactions of the beef trust. All of
the witnesses were subjected to a rigid
examination as to whether they had
been approached by outsiders since be
ing called as witnesses, the inquisitorial
body evidently being more anxious, for
the present at least, to secure further
evidence of alleged tampering with wit
nesses by Interested persons than to se
cure facts concerning the beef com
bination.
From a Federal official it was learned
that several witnesses had been ap
proached, and as soon as the proof is
in the hands of District Attorney Mor
rison it is said more Indictments will
be returned.
John Shields. Government witness in
the case against John Connors, Ar
mour's general superintendent, indicted
on a charge of trying to influence a
witness, was put under $1000 bonds to
day to appear at the July term of the
United States District Court, when the
Connors case is set tor hearing. Shields
signed his own bond and left for New
York to-night. Secret service men have
increased in numbers so rapidly that
now almost every witness of conse
quence is being shadowed.
Many other persons not directly in
terested in the daily proceedings of the
jury are also being shadowed, and
every endeavor is being made to pre
vent any tampering with witnesses.
In a statement given out to-night J.
Ogden Armour, the head of Armour &
Co., declared that the indictment re
turned against his confidential man,
Thomas J. Connors, "is the result of a
grave misunderstanding as to the
facts."
Shields is the New York representa
tive of H. J. Ellis & Co., agents for Ar
mour & Co. in Singapore, and, accord
ing to Armour's statement, Shields
called at the office of the packing com
pany of his own volition. Continuing,
Armour said:
"The usual courtesies of a business
house to its representatives were ac
corded Mr. Shields to the extent of
granting his request to communicate
with his officers in New York over ths
private wires of the compiny concern
ing his business affairs there and to
care for his incoming mail and tele
grams received until he called for the
same. During his stay in Chicago Mr.
Shields was not entertained by repre
sentatives of Armour & Co. at theater
parties or elsewhere. Mr. Connors as
sures me, and I have every reason to
believe him. that he did not, a*
charged in the indictment, attempt to
influence Shields in the performance of
his duty to appear before the jury and
give evidence on any subject on which
he might have information."
EL PASO, Tex., March 29.â The fol

resolution of Texas cattlemen to give
all possible evidence in the United
States investigation of the so-called
beef trust was issued to-day by Presi
dent W. W. Turney of the Interstate
Cattle-Growers' Association:
"Ninety-nine per cent of the cattle
growers of the country believe there
is an illegal combination, having for
its object the stifling of competition
and the controlling of 98 per cent of
the cattle shipped to the six great
slaughtering markets, Chicago, Kansas
City, St. Louis, Fort Worth, Omaha
and Los Angeles, and they are ready
to help the Government, and will help
it all they can. to break up this mon
ster. It can be done and the cattle
men will help."
OFFICERS FIND
BUNKO TRUST
PHILADELPHIA, March 29.â J. Hec
tor McNcal, receiver of the Provident
Investment Bureau, said to-day that
before the end of the week Federal of
ficials, assisted by the receivers of the
Storey Cotton Company and of the
Provident Investment Bureau, expect
to have in their possession evidence of
a widespread conspiracy to defraud the
public through the medium of ''get
rich-quick" concerns. The plan was to
form a sort of trust of big profit con
cerns. McNeal said:
'â¢We have just come into information
which leads us to believe that the
Provident Investment Bureau was only
a part of a huge conspiracy, and that
its operations covered only a small part
of a field which was designed to em
brace the whole country.
"According to our information, when
the scheme Â»b.s devised, It was recog
nized that the illegality of the transac
tion it had in view made it probable
that some one of the concern might
take French leave with most of the
profits. A written agreement was,
therefore, drawn up and signed by all.
The possibility that ajiy one of the
company might be prosecuted by the
authorities made it inadvisable to have
copies of the contract where Federal
officials might find them. Only one
copy was made, and It was placed in
chai *c of a man whose trustworthiness
could be relied upon.
"This man we have seen, but he de
nies all knowledge of such a document.
We expect to have the paper in two, or
three days, and its disclosures, we be
lieve, will be of a startling nature."

Chancellor yon Bulow Says
in the Reichstag That the
Open-Door Principle Must
Be Maintained in Morocco
KAISER WILL DEAL
DIRECT WITH SULTAN
Paris Government's Claim
to a Controlling Influ
ence Over Moorish Affairs
Will Not Be Recognized
BERLIN, March 29.â Chancellor yon
Bulow, speaking on Morocco in the
Reichstag to-day, said that Germany
would in the first instance place her
self in communication with the Sultan
of Morocco. Germany had such inter
ests in Morocco as other trading coun
tries, sÂ«ch interests as she had in
China and other parts of the world.
These interests were real and would
be protected in Morocco according to
the open-door principle.
Herr Bebel, the Socialist leader, had
raised the Moroccan question by criti
cizing the Government for taking dip
lomatic action to safeguard German
opportunities in Morocco long after the
French-British agreement, when it
should have ai-ted a year ago.
Chancellor yon Bulow said that, al
though the moment was not especially
opportune to discuss Germany's rela
tions with Morocco, he would say that
Emperor William had declared more
than a year ago to the King of Spain
that Germany had no selfish aims to
ward the territorial integrity or in
dependence of Morocco. The Emperor's
visit to Morocco had no aggressive
purpose, but apart from the indepen
dence of Morocco and apart from the
Emperor's visit, German economic in
terests remained to be protected and
they would be. These interests were
considerable.
Baron yon Kardorff, Conservative,
speaking before Chancellor yon Bulow
on Morocco and coupling the names
of France and Great Britain together,
said Germany was not accustomed to
under-estimate her opponents. Her
military power was equal to that of
any enemy.
The Deutsche Reiehs Correspondenz.
regarded as voicing Chancellor yon
Bulow's views, says Emperor William's
visit to Morocco shows that Germany
"continues her relations with the sov
ereign of Morocco and does not and
will not give up such relations to
France, which seeks to exercise a con
trolling influence in Morocco."
TANGIER, Morocco. March 29.â The
Governor of Tangier has dispatched an

It is underelooÃ that the German lega
tion has guaranteed Raissouli against
any interference from the Moorish Gov
ernment. .
STUBBORN FIRE
IN THE SUBWAY
NEW YORK. March 29.â A severe
explosion, followed by an outbreak of
fire, which up to a late hour to-night
had defied all efforts of the firemen
to extinguish it completely, occurred
to-day in an unfinished section of the
subway at Broadway and One Hun
dred and Sixty-seventh street. The
tunnel at that point is 125 feet below
the surface. The explosion followed a
collision between an ejnpty train,
which had been run too far beyond the
terminal switch, and a flat car, on
which were several Italian laborers.
General Manager Hedley stated that
the explosion was caused by a short
circuit on the third rail and the feed
cable, resulting from the collision. It
set fire to some of the timbers used by
the contractor in the tunnel. No per
son was injured.
LAND OFFICE INQUIRY
AGREEABLE TO RICHARDS
Commissioner of Opinion That Dis

OMAHA, Neb., March 29. â W. A.
Richards, the commissioner of thr
General Land Office, passed through
Omaha to-day en route to Wyoming
to visit his daughters. In regard to
the report from Washington that his
office was to be investigated with re
gard to promotions of clerks, he said
he had no knowledge of anything of
the kind, but would have no objection
to it.
During his administration of the
land office promotions had been made
solely on merit, he said, in acordance
with the requirements of the civil ser
vice. Some clerks had been reduced
because of their inability to earn the
salaries which they received, and
some of these were probably respon
sible for the report of an investiga
tion.

JOINT CONTROL
FOR MACEDONIA
New Plan Said to Be on Foot
Which Calls for United
Action on Part of Powers

Present Reform Programme
ot Austria and Russia Is
Declared to Be Inadequate
VIENNA, March 29.â The statement
i made by the British Foreign Secretary,
i Lord Lansdowrie, in the House of Lords
, yesterday on the subject of Macedonia
j was read here with great interest to
! day in official circles, where the opinion
I was reiterated that the Meurzsteg
(Au3tro-Russian) reform programme
I has now come to an absolute standstill
and is inoperative. Lord Lansdowne's
! suggestion of the necessity of further
' reforms, including the financing of
I Macedonia, was well received in official
! circles, but little hope is entertained
, that it will be successfully carried out.
j The opinion prevails that if this is at
! tempted Germany will withdraw from
I the existing union of the reform powers
and use her influence, because of her
various interests in Turkey, to coun
. teract with the Porte any further re
form measures proposed by Great Brit
ain.
In a well-informed but unofficial
! quarter it was declared to-night during
a discussion of Lord Lansdowne's
1 speech that the Macedonian question
| will soon enter uuon a new phase. The
1 powers, including Auscria and Russia,
it was declared, are now convinced that
| the programme must be enlarged and
extended and Macedonia placed under
international financial control. One of
: the features of the new control suggest-
I ed is that money collected by the au-
I thorities in the villayetes of Salonica
I Monastir and Uskub shall be employed
! solely for the benefit of Macedonia. It
! is not known here what form the in
ternational control will take, but it is
i asserted that neither the Ottoman
! Bank nor the Dette Publique will have
a hand in the financial part of the con
, trol. .._
It was said that there was reason to
; believe that the principle of introduc
i ing further international control in
' Macedonia has been irrevocably re
solved upon by the powers. Should
I Turkey offer passive resistance to this
plan ways and means will be found to
make that Government withdraw its
I opposition. These reforms, once start
; ed, will be made effective by the powers
; participating in the movement.
MISSION CLUB
HOLDS JUBILEE
The Mission Park Association held
an enthusiastic mass-meeting ar. Turn
Verein Hall, on Eighteenth and Va
lencia streets, last night to celebrate
the new grounds which are to be turn
ed into a park to adorn that part of
the city. The hall was crowded with
residents of the Mission Distr'ct, the
fair sex being present in large num
bers.
Eustace Cullinan, president of the
club, was in the chair. He opened the
meeting by giving a short address, in
which he stated the purposes of the
organization. Through the efforts of
the club the city has purchased the
old Hebrew burial ground. Now the
club will endeavor to have $25,000 ap
propriated in the next budget to beau
tify the property and make it one of
the finest parks in the country.
James D. Phelan said: "You must
get out and work if you wane to ac
complish anything." He said the peo
ple of the Mission had got out and
worked and the result was that they
were going to have a park. They had
got the land and the next thing to do
was to beautify it.
"I am in, heart and soul, for beau
tifying this great city," he said. "Na
ture and its natural situation have
done much for us, but it rests with us
to do the rest. Our beautiful Golden
Gate Park is admired by people from
every part of the world, and this
should only be a beginning of a chain
of parks that should stretch through
out the whole city. We want places
where the children can get out and
enjoy the fresh air and grow up stur
dy and strong."
Phelan's remarks were frequently
interrupted with bursts of applause.
The other speakers of the evening
were Mayor Schmitz, Percy V. Long
and Samuel Braunhart. M. J. (Billy)
Hynes, Public Administrator, enliv
ened the proceedings by doing a clev
er stunt in the shape of an amusing
monologue and wound up by singing
two new popular songs.
Miss Ethel Grazer played cleverly
on the cornet, and Charles Hay and
Miss Millie Flynn contributed inter
esting vocal numbers.
A fine band was in attendance and
played patriotic airs.

mining camp, where he will construct
the first plant in America for the ex
clusive working of molybdenum ore.
There have been many discoveries of
molybdenum in this country, but in
the past the quantity has proved toÂ«>
small for a successful enterprise. A
new ore body has been developed on
the property of the Troy- Manhattan
Copper Company, and a department
has beer organized for its exploitation
under Schwabe. The machinery has
been ordered. A contract has been se
cured from a large steel company *â¢â¢
the first 150,000 pounds of the met*
ready for the market at $1 50 per
pound.
The ore is very refractory, requires
intense heat for reduction and necessi
tates operating with electricity. Th â¢
most important use for molybdenum
will be a? an alloy for steel in the mak
ing of armor plate, heavy guns, steel
tools, etc., for which purpose, if suffi
cient quantity can be produced, it wili
supplant tunststen. a more b
metal, now in general use in this coun

employed by thy Krupp Company when
it began experimenting with molyb

Interesting talk on "The Public School* as

the energetic young pastor of St. Paul's, gave
his hearers at the Oakland Club to-day much
food for thought. Wherever there is work to
do the Oakland Club generally (alls in line
and to good purpose, and Mr. Walkley' s words
were fully appreciated as the practical sugges
tions of a real philanthropist. For instituting
the -Mothers' Club" Mr. Walkley has donÂ«
much to lighten the burdens of downs of
mothers, ho have hitherto been unable . to
enjoy any pleasure that did not come Into the
home. Now. one club day. the members take
the children, from the tiniest Infant up, to
the parlors of thÂ« church, where the pastor,
who wemÂ» to understand humanity and its
need*, has ever "some new Joy in store for old
and young. Only the other day he told them
all about the opera "'Lohengrin,'* illustrat
ing hi? talk with selections on the gramo
phone. The people who are paying $7 60 to
hear the Conried stars that are coming may
smile at grand opera on a gramophone, but
I'll wager these same people will not listen
to the real thing with more pleasure than did
those tired mothers, whose feel may not stray
into the pleasure paths that others seek, be
cause little hands are keeping them within
the rate* of home.
Then again, at Mr. Walkley's request, the
Starr King Art Association Invited the Moth

INQUIRY GOES
TO OTHER MEN
OAKLAND. March 29.â Following in
the wake of the Police Commissioners'
action demanding Patrolman J. F. Sill's
resignation for the good of the service
comes the report that two more police
men are slated for possible forced re
tirement Friday at the last meeting of
the board before its term of office ex
pires. None of the Commissioners would
to-day admit more than the fact that
two alleged derelict bluecoats' names
are under consideration in connection
with charges. One of the men is said
to have been involved In an affair with
a woman. The other accusation runs
that a patrolman was caught stealing
newspapers from front doorsteps on his
beat. i
President McElroy of the board said:
The charges are not In shape and as a
matter of fact may not materialize. The mat
ters are under inquiry. It would be man
ifestly unfair and unjust to these men to
name them until definite form has been given
to the subject.
Of the same mind was Commissioner
F. C. Turner, to whom both men's
names were first given. Turner de
clared he would not consent to publicity
until better information was at hand.

WIDOWS' FOE
IS SENTENCED
"Dr." William Proctor Must
Spend Six Years at San
Quentin for His 3lisdeeds
HE ROBBED OLD WOMEN
Would Propose Marriage and
After Gaining Their Con
fidence Take Their Money
OAKLAND, March 29.â For robbing
aged Emily Tyson of Niles by getting
money from her under the pretense
that he was going to marry her "Dr."
William S. Proctor, a bunco man, was
sentenced to six years at San Quentin
this morning by Judge Melvin. Old
women were his victims, and his graft
was to seil an old lady a pair of spec
tacles and rub up an acquaintance in
this way, and in a few visits make a
proposal of marriage. He is a big
strapping fellow, and from the com
plaints received by the authorities he
was Â«uccessful in many instances.
In his courtship of Emily Tyson he
represented himself to be 59 years of
age, thougrh he is some twenty years
from that mark. He induced the old
lady to let him have two diamond rings
and $108 in cash. For stealing the rings
he was found guilty of petit larceny
and another jury found him guilty of
Krand larceny for taking the money.
In passing sentence on him Judge
Melvin tod him that he had not only
been found guilty, but that he had
added to the offense by taking the
stand and perjuring himself. He said
the community was entitled to pro
tection from such persons. A stay of
ten days was granted in which to give
Attorney W. H. H. Gentry time to
appeal to the Supreme Court, it being
a mooted question whether it was grand
larceny or embezzlement of which
Proctor is guilty. If he has been found
guilty on the wrong charge he ma>
gain his liberty.
"HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT"
ON BOARDS TO-MORROW
Clever Performance of Children to Be
Given at Steimvay Hall
for Charity.
"The House That Jack Built," the
children's operetta, to be given to
morrow night at Steinway Hall for
the benefit of the charity fund of the
Society for Christian Work, promises
to be a great success. Over 100 chil
dren will participate and many of
them show talent of an unusual order.
"The House That Jack Built" is full of
lively music and pretty dances. The
various characters of "Mother Goose"
tales are portrayed and there are many
opportunities for clever work by the
young singers and actors. Several of
the younger children have solos to
sing, and among them, especially the
boys, are some exceptional voices. Re
hearsals for the performance have
been in progress for nearly a month
under the direction of Miss Margaret
Martin of Chicago, assisted by Miss
Fernanda Pratt of San Francisco, as
accompanist.
The children have taken a great in
terest in the play and have worked
hard to make it a success. To the
boys fall most of the comedy parts,
notably that of Old King Cole, played
by Leon Vanetta: the Knave of Hearts,
by Marion Vecki, and Jack Goose, by
Chester Cohen.
There are dozens of interesting char
acters besides Old King Cole and
Mother Goose, such as fairies, flower
girls, attendants to King Cole and the
Quen of Hearts, etc.
The Starr King Cadet Corps will
give an exhibition drill during the per
formance.
The patroÂ»esses of the affair are
Miss Anna Beaver, Mrs. Alpheus Bull,
Mrs. James Marvin Curtis, Mrs. Wil
liam Hardy, Mrs. W. B. Harrington,
Mrs. Louis Lisser, Mrs. Charles H.
Mann, Mrs. William H. Mills, Mrs. Ho
ratio Stebbins, Mrs. Austin Sperry,
Mrs. Franklin Sumner, Mrs. Arthur
Sharp. Mrs. William R. Wheeier and
Mrs. Fafrfax Wheelan.
Negro Tliief Conscience- Stricken.
Harry Treese, a colored bootblack,
surrendered himself to the police in
Oakland on Tuesday night. He said
he had been employed In the barber
shop of W. E. Dellow, 1102 Slitter
street, this city, and on Tuesday af
ternoon had taken $6 50 out of the
cash register. His conscience had
been troubling him and that was why
he wanted to be arrested. The police
here were notified and yesterday De
tective Cody went to Oakland and
brought Treese to the City Prison.
Dellow had reported the theft to the
police.
JEFFRIES IS WILLING
TO MEET MARVIN HART
NEW YORK, March 25. â When
Champion Jim Jeffries received word
to-day that Marvin Hart had defeated
Jack Johnson he repeated his state
ment made some time ago that he
would be willing to meet the Ken-,
tuckian if the latter/beat the colored
champiofi. Jeffries said:
'"I am glad Hart won, not that it
necessarily means we will get into the
ring in a fight for the championship,
but because it puts the negro out of
the running. If Johnson had won he
would never have fought me, as my
decision never to fight a negro would
have been faithfully kept. If Hart is
considered out of my class I will retire
from the ring this year forever."
To the spectators who witnessed
Tuesday night's affair In Woodward's
â  Pavilion the proposal to match Hart
| with Jeffries sounds like an All Fools'
day joke. Hart declared his willing
| ness yesterday to meet Jeffries, pos
sibly having in view the loser's end of
a big purse. There are city authorities
| charged with the prevention of cruelty
j and they would undoubtedly prevent
i such a match.
! The scientific world is probably the
; loser through the defeat of Jack John
son. Had he ever faced Jeffries the
scientists would see a man change his
| color, a phenomenon in which many
are interested.
Johnson was a sore disappointment
to his backers. Many of the shrewd
est judges of form backed him heavily.

Autnorities Working
on the Theory
ol Murder. \
Companion Is Taken
in Charge Pend
ing Inquest.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SAN MATEO. March 29.â The moat
sensational tragedy in the history of
thiÂ« town occurred here last night,
when Miss Polly Locke died from a
pistol shot while alone in a room with
Jeff Stewart, a married man and an
employe of the Crocker estate. The
body lies In the county morgue at Red
wood City and Stewart is held with
out bail in the county jail, pending
the result.of the inquest. District At
torney Bullock and the local police
are puzzling their wits to ascertain
if death was the result of murder, sui
cide or accident.
When taken into custody last night
Stewart said the woman deliberately
killed herself. To-day he is said to have
told the District Attorney that she killed
herself by accident. Which statement.
If either, is correct the Coroner's Jury.
\vhk.'h will sit next Saturday, will de
cide, and on its decision depends
whether Stfwart must stand trial on
a felony charge or be set free.
The tragedy occurred in a room sit
uated in the rear of M. F. Brown's
saloon, which is used as a sleeping
apartment by Ben Race, a former bar
keeper of Brown's. Stewart borrowed
the key from Race Tuesday evening,
telling him he desired to take a nap,
as was his custom. It was Sta*art
who, half an hour later, gave the alarm
and, when Constable Sheehan arrived,
surrendered himself. He stated that
when he and the woman vent to the
room he laid his pistol on a table.
After they had been there a short
time she seized the revolver when his
back was turned and fired the fatal
shot. He knew of no reason, he said,
for the deed.
Dr. Norris examined the dead woman
and found that the jugular, vein had
been severed. Judge Booth then com
mitted the prisoner in default â¢ f $1000
bail. After a more thorough examina
tion by Redwood physicians under the
direction of Coroner Crowe this morn
ing, District Attorney Bullock ordered
that Stewart be held without bail. The
uature of the wonted showed that the
bullrt had entered the left side of the
head, near the top. and passed out on
the right side of the neck. It was held
that it would be extremely difficult
for such a wound to be made by the
victim, and the fact has materially
strengthened the theory of non-suicide
upon which the police are working.
The dead woman, who was about 40
years of age, was one of four daugh
ters of the late John Locke, an emi
nently respectable man, who lived near
Half moon Bay. The wife and mother,
h<uvever, was a Peruvian Indian girl,
reputed to be a descendant of the
Incas. She possessed rare beauty in
her youth, much of which was inher
ited by her daughters, who were reign
ing favorites on the Coast side some
twenty years apo. The family re
moved to Mountain View some years
ag<> and Miss Polly lived with them.
She came to San Mateo yesterday and
imbibed to some extent in company
with Stewart.
Stewart was married in this city to
Miss Congdon. a highly respectable
young woman, from whom he was re
cently separated. They have one child.
He came here from Colorado about
three years ago and for some time
has been employed as a watchman by
the Crocker estate. He habitually
carried a revolver, which he was fond
of flourishing.
GRAND JVRORS APPEAR
ON ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
Reason (iivrn Why They Refused to
Testify In Damage Case for
False Arrest.
Thomas P. Andrews, foreman of the
Grand Jury, and E. J. Bowes, a mem
ber of that body, were before Judge
Seawell yesterday to show cause why
they should not answer certain Inter
rogations put to them by the court
commissioner in the case instituted
against the Grand Jury, former Chief
of Police Wittman, his bondsmen, and
District Attorney Byington by Robert
E. McCarthy, who seeks 1 10,000 dam
ages for false imprisonment.
McCarthy was arrested while leaving
the premises at 620 Jackson street on
January 23 last. He alleges that the
premises described are occupied by Se
bastian Ravini as a store. On the
other hand the defendants allege that
in fact McCarthy was arrested while
leaving a disreputable resort and that
hence his arrest was legal and proper.
The members of the Grand Jury re
ferred to admit they caused the ar
rest, but there they stop.
During the examination of the
grand jurors before the court commis
sioner they were asked certain ques
tions they deemed were intended to
disclose secrets of the Grand Jury and
the policy it Intends to pursue in its
campaign against vice in the city.
They refused to answer the questions
on the ground that such information
as they possessed was privileged.
Yesterday afternoon before Judge
Seawell Attorney Henry Ach said that
the act of the defendants in causing
the arrest of the plaintiff without a
warrant was in itself a crime and that
McCarthy was entitled to such infor
mation as they could give that wtmld
enable him to successfully prosecute
his case. District Attorney Byington
of counsel for the defendants con
tested this claim, saying that the ar
rest was entirely lawful and that what
ever part the grand jurors played in
the case was in line with their duty
and that they were entitled to keep
the facts arising at their, deliberations
secret.
Judge Seawell took the case under
advisement.
Lost* Her Watch and Chain,
Miss Cleo Townsend. 2132 OFarrell
street, reported to the police yester
day that her gold watch and chain
valued at 125. had either been stolen
or lost. She rode on a Turk-street
car on Tuesday night to Market and
transferred to a Powell-street oar
She got off the latter car at California
street, when she missed the watch and
chain.

ASKS FOR REHEARING
Ex-Sergeant Thomas Ellis,
Who Was Dismissed, Makes
a Plea to Be Reinstated
Contrary to all expectations, the new
Chief of Police was not named by the
commissioners last night. Though Ser
geant Ellis' place was filled by the pro
motion of Corporal William M. Ross,
and the vacancies caused by the re
moval of the patrolmen of his squad
were filled from the eligible list, the
matter of the appointment of a new
Chief was not touched.
Rumor was persistent before and dur
ing the meeting that the appointment
would be announced and that Detec
tive Sergeant Jerry Dinan would be the
man selected. The board did not touch
the matter, however. All three Com
missioners maintain that they are in
no hurry to announce who has been
chosen.
The application of Sergeant Ellis for
a rehearing was filed and laid on the
table for two weeks. Eliis seeks an
other hearing on two grounds: "That
the board had no jurisdiction to hear
and determine upon the charges, and
i hat ther- nee introduced

There was a hitch in the programme
- to the fact that Herbert Sehmitz

ner. In fact. Herbert went so far

HAGGARD LABORS
FOR THE MASSES
Author Strives to Uplift Mankind
H. RIDER HAGGARD. EMINENT ENGLISH NOVELIST. WHO IS HERE TO IN
VESTIGATE COLONIZATION SCHEME OF SALVATION ARMY AT SOLEDAD.
HE WILL DEVOTE SEVERAL DAYS TO WORK OF INSPECTION.
H. Rider Haggard, the English
novelist, whose weird stories have al
ways proved interesting reading mat
ter to the American public, arrived
here last evening froth the south and
is staying at the Occidental Hotel.
Haggard is accompanied by his daugh-^
ter. Miss Angela Rider Haggard, his
private secretary, Ranson Coygill, and
his assistant secretary. Henry Wright.
The author has come to America on a
mission That is expected to result in
much benefit to the poorer classes of
London and possibly those of other
countries of the eastern continent,
whore the congested conditions of the
cities and the unfortunate predica
ment of the lower classes as a result
of their restraint is becoming a seri- J
ous subject for national consideration.
Haggard has been commissioned by |
the British Government to visit the j
init^d States for the purpose of look- j
ing into and reporting on the success â¢
of the colonization projects undertaken
by the Salvation Army. It was his
â¢Rural England," a comparatively
recent production, dealing with de
terioration of agricultural pursuits in j
England, in which the writer gave vent
to opinions that were accepted as I
warnings to the Government and
promptly heeded by her statesmen, that
was responsible for Haggard's present
visit to this country.
In the English farmer's abandonment
of the plow and his rush to the larger [
ctiies in search of lighter work and i
supposed greater remuneration, and the
resultant overcrowding of the metropo
lis with ill-conditioned people, Hag
gard saw a danger that has readily
appealed to the sound sense of his
countrymen, who were not long in ap
preciating the possibility of a deteriora
tion of English manhood and the ulti
mate fall of the empire.
BOOTH TUCKER'S SOLUTION*.
It was a subject that provoked much
discussion and finally brought forth
from Commander Booth Tucker the
declaration that a solution of the dif
ficulties existing would be found in the
colonization experiments of the Salva
tion Army in this country. Forthwith
Haggard was duly commissioned to
visit the United States and look into
the colonization scheme of the army,
and a month ago he embarked on his
Western trip. Arriving in New York he
remained three days there, then pro
ceeded to Philadelphia and from there
to Washington, where he was a guest
of President Roosevelt, who expressed
to his visitor his hearty co-operation in
any project that Haggard might in
augurate that would benefit mankind
throughout the world. Leaving Wash- I
ington. Haggard journeyed slowly
westward by way of the southern
route, stopping off at various points to
study irrigation, and finally reaching j
several days ago the Salvation Army's |
colony at Romie, in Monterey County, |
where he made a thorough investiga
tion of the conditions existing. In this
work he was assisted by Colonel
French of the army, who had met him
at El Paso.
Of his observations at the colony
Haggard would have little to say, ex
plaining that in view of the fact that !
he was under commission to make a I
report to his Government he did not j
feel that it was within his province to i
discuss the matter publicly. He did
say this, however:
I was pleased to find the members of the
Romie colony extremely contented with their
environment* and happy over the thought
that they were not only enabled to gain a
comfortable livelihood, but to eventually ac
quire, aÂ» the fruits of their labors, the ground
they are tilling. I failed to find one dtÂ»
gruntled person in the entire colony. I would
like to say more about these happy people,
but I must save my Information for my re
port.

dent Roosevelt, the distinguished au
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. MARCH 30, 1905.
thor suddenly brightened up and made
a move that suggested that he : was
about to enter upon a long discussion
of that â  affair, but suddenly relapsing
into a silent mood again, he said:
The people of the United States, from my
point â¢of view, made an excellent selection
when they elevated Theodore Roosevelt to the
highest position in their gift. He is a re
markable manâ a fact that deeply impressed
me at both visits I enjoyed with him. He Is
a man worthy of any trust the people may
repose in him. He certainly showed a deep
interest in my mission, but I would not care
to discuss our interviews. I would like to
say something about your country, that Is,
what I have already seen of it. It is un
doubtedly a great one and remarkably pros
perous. In my opinion, however, it still needs
more populating. There is still much , idle
land that needs to be tilled, for the more
that your toilers take from the ground the
longer will they be assured -of their pros
perity. ; > . .
Our greatest failing at present in England
is the fact that the tiller* of the soil are
growing fewer and fewer. The alluring attrac
tions of the big cities have caused thousand's
to leave the healthy atmosphere of the open
country and strive in vain in the overpopulated
metropolis for a livelihood for which they
originally -were -not destined. It is to coun
teract this mad rush " that England must rind

â WILL VISIT AMITY COLONY.
_ Haggard expects to remain here
three or four days and then continue
on to Colorado, where he will visit
the Amity colony, the largest and
most successful undertaken by the
Salvation Army. It is possible that he '
will . also visit Salt Lake for the pur- i
pose of investigating Mormon meth
ods of co-operation and to also in
spect various irrigation enterprises.
Much of his ; tour between San : Fran
cisco and Denver will depend on the
suggestion of John Hays Hammond,
the noted mmmg â : engineer, who is
soon to leave for the East in his pri
vate car and is eager to have Haggard
as his guest. j The two first met 1 in
South Africa and " between them exists
a strong. bond of friendship that dem
onstrated itself at their meeting yes
terday and : later when the English
author was I the guest of Hammond at I
dinner at the Pacific Union Club. . -â¢ I
In response ,to the question if he had
been gathering material for a new
novel during his short stay in this
country, Haggard â¢ answered that he
had not. > He referred to his latest pro
duction, "The Brethren," a story of the
crusaders, which has only recently been
issued and is meeting, with success in
this country. : Before he - undertakes to
write another ; story, Haggard said, â¢he
will have ; written a great * deal 5 about
colonization schemes and : other phases
of a general plan ; to relieve the rapidly
increasing burden of the poorer classes

Company.
File Suit in WlUch Wreck
ing oi a Railroad Is
Alleged,
Secretary of State FeDimore Chatter
ton Named as One of the
Defendants.
6peclal Dispatch to The Call.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., March . 29.â A !
sensational suit was filed in the Dis
trict Court at noon to-day and marks
the beginning of the gigantic struggle
between the Belgo-American oil in
terests, backed by the Rothschilds, and
the Chicago and Northwestern Rail
way, backed by the Standard Oil Com- \
I puny.
Joseph H. Lobell, promoter of the
i Eelgo-Ameiiean interests, which own. 1
! the oil wells at Lander, the Caspar re- j
fineries and the Salt River oil wells, '
is the plaintiff, and General Manager
George F. Bidwell, Chief Attorney
i White and local attorney Clark of the
I Northwestern, Secretary of State Feni
j more Chatterton and H. B. Coolidge
j of the Wyoming State Railway, are
named as defendants.
Lobell in his petition asks that a re
ceiver be appointed for the Wyoming
State Railway and prays for an in
junction against tht same concern, re
straining it from proceeding further j
with the surveys an.l building of the
Btlgo- American Rail.oad from Orin ;
Junction to Lander.
Lobell alleges that he paid to T. J. '
i Milner the sum of $5000 to make the
surveys from Orin to Lander and that
aiilner, Chatterton, Knight and the
others then organized the Wyoming
State Railway Company for the pur
pose of wrecking the Belgo-American
! Company. They incurred an indebted
j ness of more than $8000 in excess of
the $5000 paid to Milner and finally sold
out to the Chicago and Northwestern
I Company. Coolidge, Knight and Mil
[ ncr resigned from the Wyoming State !
Railway as part of this deal and Bid- ;
well. White and Clark were elected in :
their places. A portion of the stock, I
involving the right of way and other
privileges, paid for by Lobell, was
transferred to the three later, they
I practically, absorbing the road.
Lobell, representing the French. Bel
gian and English capitalists who had
planned to build railroads, erect oil
refineries and carry on a general oil
business in opposition to the Standard
Oil trust, demands the surveys and
right of way privileges. The Burling
ton Railroad is said to be associated
with Lobell. It is expected the case
will be thrown into the Federal court
and all of the details of the alleged
raiway steal exposed.
TOPEKA, Kan.. March 29. â The
Standard Oil Company has discontin
ued giving jobbers and wholesalers in
Kansas concessions in price on refined
oil and gasoline. The effect of this
j order will be, it is said, to take the
j business of the handling of the kero
| sene away from the wholesalers, who
! now will have to pay the retail price
j for these commodities.
This new order was made public to
! day through a letter to Governor Hoch
i from J. S. George of Hutchinson, a
I wholesale grocer, who inclosed a copy
' of the order received by his company
: from the headquarters of the Standard
jat Wichita. The order was signed by
: A. C. Dunks.
This is believed to be the first step
; in a campaign which the Standard will
make to have the anti-discrimination
law repealed by the next Legislature.
JEFFERSON CITY. Mo., March 29.â
Attorney-General Hadley to-day filed
in the Supreme Court an application
for a writ of quo warranto for the
purpose of ousting the Standard Oil
Company, the Republic Oil Company
and the Waters-Pierce Oil Company
of their franchises for doing business
in Missouri. The Supreme Court issued
the writ and made it returnable to the
court en bane on April 11. The applica
tion charges the company with being
in a combination to control prices, and
the supply of oil in the State.

WASHINGTON, March 29. â The
President has decided t<\ recommend
the selection of William E. Gould of
Baltimore as one of the Collectors of
Customs in Santo Domingo.
BALTIMORE, Md., March 29.âWil
liam E. Gould is a New Yorker, though
he has resided here for some time past.
He is a graduate of Johns Hopkins and
has made a special study of the Ro
manic languages. At present he Is do

of the Evening Herald of this city.
Professor Jacob H. Hollander of
Johns Hopkins University, who has
been appointed special Commissioner to
Santo Domingo by President Roose
velt, will sail from vÂ»ew York on Sat
urday morning.
Professor Hollander said this morn
ing that his mission was purely to
study the conditions in Domingo,
so as to be able upon his return to
make a verbal report to the President,
who was anxious to know the exact
financial and industrial status of the
people.

REVOLT CANNOT SUCCEED.
United States Will Protect the Mo- |
rales Government.
WASHINGTON, March 29.âSecreta
ry Taft made no declaration to-day
about the alleged revolutionary move
ment at Monte Cristi, Santo Domingo,
but said that an American agent was
at that port collecting the revenue, and
intimated that II was not likely that
this Government would allow any dis
turbance to interfere wi'.h his duty.
This refers to Commander Leper of the
Detroit.
It is said at the department that the
next step in the execution of the de- j
partment's plans relative to Santo Do
mingo cannot be taken until President .
Morales has formally concluded the ar- j
rangement with the foreign creditor
powers, two of which, up to yesterday,
had not acted. When the President has
secured ihc necessary signatures to his
agreement and has so informed Wash
ington the Secretary of War will at
Dnce nominate to President Morales the
person who is to act as chief collector,
and perhaps the sub-collectors at the
minor ports, though it is possible the
designation of these will be left to the
chief collector.

Warship Must Be Sent to Protect i

The Navy Department, it is said, ;
probably will send the cruiser Newark.
Admiral Sigsbee's flagship, now at
Guantanamo, to Port-au-Prince. The
distance is but 180 miles and the latter
port can be quickly reached. The
Brooklyn Is expected to arrive at Guan
tanamo to-night or to-morrow.
J. E. Jager, the Haytian Minister in
Washington, said to-night that he was
greatly surprised to hear of Minister
Powell's cablegram, as he was not
aware of any threatened trouble in his
country. He has telegraphed to the
President of Hayti for Information. To
day the Minister had a talk over the
telephone with the Haytian Commis
sioner at New York, who said he had
received a dispatch from the President
of the republic to-day and that it con
tained no reference to a possible rising.
The Minister is unable to understand
why the specific dates of March 31 and
April 1 are mentioned as dates on which
it is doubtful whether the authorities
can maintain order. So far as he is
aware there is nothing of an unusual
nature to occur on those dates.
DOMINICANS ELATED.

SAN DOMINGO, Republic of Santo
Domingo, March 29.â The news of the
acceptance by the Government at
Washington of the proposition of the
Dominican Government that the Gov
ernment of the United States assume
control of the finances of this republic,
with the view of setting aside a portion
of the revenues for the payment of its
debts, pending definite action on the
part of the American Senate, has had
a most favorable effect here. The opin
ion is expressed that the action taken
by the authorities at Washington Vill
change the situation completely.
AUSTRALIANS SEER TRADE
OF PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
Simultaneously Strive to Have Tariff
Placed on Dried Fruits From
California.
In a circular just issued by the Pa
cific Commercial Museum attention is
called to efforts that are making for
the capture of trade in the Philip
pines by the merchants and manufac
turers of Australia. The circular is,
in part, as follows:
It appears that the Government of New
South Wales. Australia, has for some time
past maintained a commercial agent in the
Orient, Including the Philippine Islands, who
has received much encouragement from Manila
merchants.
Among other articles for which the Aus
tralian commercial agent has had inquiries
are manufactured leather goods, resulting in
the prompt shipment by Australian manu
facturers of representative lines of samples, in
cluding boots and shoes, harness, trunks,
valises and leather for various purposes. Other
Important items for which the Australian
agent expects to develop a substantial trarU
are soaps and candles. The importations of
these lines into Manila last year amounted
to, approximately, $140,000. As such good*
have appeared on the Manila market only
during the last few years the demand seems
to be constantly increasing. Australia has
also been asked to supply timber for the
islands, the demand for which Is only In its
infancy.
Besides the above items there are many
avenues for new- trade for the producers and
manufacturers of New South Wales and it is
jeported that a kindly feeling exists on the
part of Manila merchants toward fostering
the trade with the Australian colonies.
The museum has called frequent attention
to the trade possibilities of our island pos
sessions and it is to be regretted that local
houses do not undertake to secure this trade
for San Francisco. It has been previously
pointed out that merchants of Manila are.
anxious to foster commercial relations with
the* United State*, but they an- not disposed
to come to us for their requirements entirely
unsolicited. Direct efforts should be made to
interest them tn the goods obtainable on the
Pacific Coast. ~\
At the present time Australian fruit grow
eri" are strongly urging the Government to
impose a heavy protective tariff against Cali
fornian dried fruits and similar products and
yet it is apparent that Australia is making
strenuous efforts to capture the trade of the
Philippine Islands, which could, by a little
effort be directed to the Pacific Coast.
The' Pacific Commercial Museum will be
pleased to furnish all those interested in secur
ing trade in the above mentioned lines the
fullest information regarding the trade pos
sibilities and how business can be secured.
BATHS AS CURE
FOR DEMENTIA
Entirely New Method Tried
in a New York Hospital
With Encouraging Success
WATER ENDS DELIEirM
In One Case a Patient Was
Kept Immersed in a Tub
for Period of Two Weeks
NEW YORK. March 29.â 8y the sys
tematic use of various forma of hot and
: cold baths, Jets and douches, vapor and
â¢ hot air baths, the Manhattan State
Hospital on Ward's Island has done
away entirely with sedatives or me
: chanical restraint for the patients, even
i when violently demented or in strong
: deliriums.
This hospital, the first public institu
! tion in the country to adopt the use of
j water as a recognized part of Its course
! of treatment, has been experimenting
' and tabulating the results for some
time.
Forms of "water treatment" are in
| use there, which are said not to have
! been tried elsewhere, notably the "con
: tinuous bath" for patients In violent
i delirium. The patient, placed in a
| bathtub of water at exactly blood heat,
is kept there under observation by ex
perienced nurses and the physicians
! for hours â for days if necessary â until
the delirium has abated. In one case
it was found necessary to keep the pa
tient Immersed in the water fourteen
J days. She came out of the delirium
I and under other branches of the treat
' n.ent recovered from her dementia.
i The death rate in such cafes was for
i merly 60 per cent, but the physicians
I having charge of the experiments be
lieve their treatment will save the life
; of every patient under delirium, unless
some other form of insanity or physical
disease sets in.
Under the new scheme patients, no
longer subject to constraint, are kept
outdoors in tents and pavilions. They
are first examined carefully by a physi
cian and the nurses who then from
the data map out a plan of treatment.
i In some cases a bath of carbon dioxide
has been used. An elaborate arrange
i ment of bath apparatus has been es
\ tablished in the hospital for the full
development of the system.

ANOTHER TRANSCONTINENTAL ROAD.
WHILE the conditions of transportation and the effect pro
posed reforms in this country may have upon transcontinental
freights are discussed here, the Dominion of Canada is launch
ing another transcontinental road, under conditions and stipulations
ibat interest American commerce, and may be studied by our legis
lators with advantage. The new line is the Grand Trunk Pacific
RaiHray, which when completed will be in extent second only to
;he trail-Siberian line, its Pacific terminus is not yet selected. It
will start at Moncton. whence it will radiate in four sections. One
of these will run to Sydney and Halifax in Xova Scotia, one to St.
Johns. New Brunswick, and a third to Montreal. The fourth is the
main line which runs by Winnipeg, and on to the Pacific. The road
will be operated as a whole, fulfilling its character as a trunk line.
ill send branches to Hudson Bay and the Canadian shore of
Lake Superior.
Invested in this greatest of the transcontinental roads is th?
credit of the Dominion of Canada and that of the Grand Trunk
Railway, a corporation owned in London, which will operate the
fine. The Eastern division, which ends at Winnipeg, is to be
built entirely by the Dominion Government ; it will then be taken
over by the (iraml Trunk corporation, which will pay the Govern
ttt on its outlay. At the end of the lease, which runs
-. the Government, being the owner, may re-lease it, or
other disposition of the property. This division covers 1875
â¢ "mated cost is $40,000 per mile. The length of the
livtstOti is 14K0 mile--. For its construction the Government
guarai ; ranÂ«l Trunk Pacific Company Â«rithoul
|8o miles of mountain construction, and up to $t 3.000 per
the resl of the line. Tor the fir>t seven years after con
struction the company has the use of the Eastern division without
rental, with an extension to ten years, if the income will not war
rant the payment of the 3 per cent. It was intended that there should
Â» neither mileage subsidy nor land grant, but since this was
in the Dominion Parliament, the company asks for a land
grant that amounts to 7.000.000 acres.
The objects of building this road are stated by the Finance Min
ister to be : A complete road from ocean to ocean, wholly in Cana- i
dian territory, so that Canada in dealing with the United States ill
international trade arrangements may not be handicapped by lack j
of a road of her own : to provide another transcontinental railway to
supply facilities required by the rapid settlement of the Northwest j
Territory, and to have effective competition with the Canadian Pa- j
dfic : to promote settlement in British Columbia, the Northwest Ter- j
ritory. Manitoba and Northern Ontario and Quebec, and Central
New Brunswick, and finally to make this a part of a new traffic
rente from Western Europe to Eastern Asia, by connecting with it j
steamers on both oceans. This means competition with the San
Francisco and Vancouver routes.
The agreement with the Government provides that all freight'!
originating on the line, not specifically routed otherwise by the ship
per, when for Canadian points, shall be carried entirely on Canadian i
territory; and when not specifically routed ."hall be carried through
Canadian seaports, and that the through rate on export traffic shall
?.t.no time be greater by way of Canadian than by way of United J
States ports. ;
The company agrees that it shall not. in any matter in. its
power, directly or indirectly, advise or encourage the transportation
of freight by any other routes, but shall in good, faith develop'; trade
through Canadian channels and Canadian ports; and that.it will not
divert, but. as far as it lawfully can will prevent the diversion of
trade to ports outside of Canada. These conditions prevent pooling"
or joint traffic arrangements with other transcontinental, lines. - ;-/'.* ;
It is plain that this new road is to play a. large part in land and
ocean carriage. It is claimed that it will be able to carry eastward
the wheat crop of its territory; in competition with the part rail
and part water routes. â :-;.
This project is the definite entry of Canada into commercial
competition with the United States. The enterprise is infused with
a strong spirit of patriotism, and may have also some germs of in
dependent nationality. Our business men and transportation inter
ests will find that it isÂ« force that must be reckoned with. It will
divide the attention of the commercial world with our isthmian
canal, for it is, in a high sense, a counter enterprise.
BUSINESS MEN FOR PEACE.
OBLIGATORY arbitration of international disputes is 'plainly
the next step to be taken in the world's advance toward the
abolishment of war. When we advance so far as to deny the
rig^lu of nations to settle disputes by violence that will be a long
' c in the evolution upward. How to achieve that is a question
which the Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration has
undertaken to solve.
The organization aims to induce business men to work with
it. In a review of the first decade of the conference's doings, it
-tated that perhaps the most striking results have been achieved in
that way. The Boards of Trade and the Chambers of Commerce
practically al! the large cities of the country are taking an active
interest in the subject of international arbitration. Fourteen of these
omeroial bodies have appointed permanent committees to give
iheir attention to it. Thirteen send official delegates to the confer
ence : all of ihem are correspondents of it and are showing a lively,
interest in the promotion of arbitration.
Ideals count for little until united with some practical force to
make the dream take on the form of fact. Business men see how
and more closely interwoven are becoming the interests of all
â pie*. The depression of prosperity in one country by war, or even
the fright of the rumor of war, affects the welfare of the whole
world of workers and savers. Without counting the expense and loss
of life in war, the mere cost of the preparation is an enormous waste
that advancing civilization should refuse to stand for.
An enterprising citizen of Japan has published a crudely printed
pamphlet in both English and Japanese in which he pleads for uni
versal peace, and to that end proposes tfje establishment of a uni
versal peace society. In it he expresses the suspicion, which may be
the natural one for the whole Japanese nation, that the Hague con
ference might be a new and extremely subtle move made by some
power in an international game. Certainly the Czar's actions toward
Japan show that he most signally failed to use the best opportunity
<>f his life to prove the sincerity of his high ideals in having the
Hague tribunal established. There was his chance to breathe strong
ality into that fair child which he so promisingly fathered, but
he did not so elect. To give that Hague ideal full vitality, arbitra
tion should be made obligatory. So says the Mohonk Conference.
<>ur business men are our best hope to hasten that next step in
civilization's advance.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 30. 1905.
SPLENDID NERVE
OF HENRY FRICK,
THE IRONMASTER
ONE of the
most notable
cases on rec
ord where a man
won his cause
through the exer
cise of sheer pluck
wAs when H. < '.
Frick was shot
down by anarchist,
Berkman during!
th c Homestead |
riots, says the Chi
cago Tribune.
Whatever may be
one's opinion as to
the justice of his
cause, his . nerve
must arouse ad-l
miration. It was al
time of great polit
ical excitement and party managers
brought the greatest influence to bear
on Mr. Frickj to get him to agree
to the terms demanded by the men.
He had answered some of the requests
by the remark: "'lf the President of
the United States and his entire Cab
inet, and the Republican National
Committee and Andrew Carnegie in
person should come to me and ask
for peace 1 would not yield an inch.
I shall fight it out if it takes all sum
mer and all winter, and every dollar
I have in the world:" Then came the
blow that struck him down physical
ly, and more than promised to defeKt
hif= ends as well.
hiS..RY C â¢ *KIUK.
Berkman strolled into Mr. Fri< k's
private office and shot him. Frick
turned upon him and in spite of the
stabs which the man landed grappled
with him until help came. When he
had been helped to a sofa and the
man overpowered, Mr. Frick's remark
was. "Turn that man around, I want
to look at him." The speedy end of
tho strike was predicted. From his
bed for two weeks, however, Mr.
Frick directed its course, thinking of
nothing else until he had won the
strike, although for the whole time
his life was despaired of.
THE RAINY DAY.
"Archie" Gunn, the artist, tells a
story of the fellow worker who was

chap who has regularly â¢ made it a
practice to borrow money of Mr.
Gunn's friend. ' **'â "'/
In this letter the <;hap who is al

his correspondent by saying: "This
time I have decided to reverse the
usual order of things,, and. instead of
borrowing from you, ' I inclose here
with $50, which 1 am going to ask that
you will lay aside for mfc for ii rainy
day."
But thÂ» friend of Mr. Gunn couldn't
find any remittance in the letter. He
searched for It on the floor, under the
table, in f act ; ' everywhere he thought
'he nrigfrtt hav<? dropped it. â¢ Then quite
accidentally he turned over the sheet

CHICAGO WOMAN ASKS
BURGLAR TO RETURN
HER WEDDING RING
MRS. CHARLES
T. WILT, 71
Lake View
avenue, Chicago,
has appealed to
the sentirilfcnt and
manhood of a
burglar to return
her wedding ring,
which, together
with diamonds and
jewels to the value
of $500, was taken
from her room
while the family
was at dinner one
day recently, says
the Inter Ocean. Mr. Wilt, who is
trunk manufacturer, inserted an ad
vertisement in the papers, asking the
thief to return the wedding ring and
keep the diamonds, or to return the
jewels and receive a reward of $100.
As yet there has been no reply. The
thief entered Mrs. Wilt's room over
a porch roof, but was frightened away
before he had time to secure more
than the jewel case. The theft was
discovered by Miss Ana Fairbairn, a
sister of Mrs. Wilt, who passed Mrs.
Wilt's room a few minutes later and
found the window open. In the jewel
case was a pair of earrings valued at
$300, and several ring's, one of which
was carried by Mr. Wilt through the
Santiago campaign.
MORE HAPPINESS THAN SORROW
Health and Love and Truth Form the Founda
tions of Our Gladness.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
-. ." â  âHE Burden of Joy." the first essay in Blisr, Carman's latest volume,
â¢â¢ I palled 'The Friendship of Art." will interest that correspond-
I ent of mine who asks;: "May not joy teach all that sorrow and
â  pain can? Does love teach more than jojr <>r hotsow? Goethe be-
lieved we best grow in an atmosphere of joy."
For it insists that joy is the only tiling in the world more inevitable, more
universal than sorrow;" that even in small lives there is more gladness than
grief, and more delight than despair. Happiness, says the essayist, comes to
us in three waysâ through health, through love and through knowledge of
truth. In order to be greatly happy one must have his due share of all these
kinds of gladness; and unless he has something of at least one of. them he is
not happy 'at all. ->v-> ' -
This 's a clear and wise statement of a general fact. Into the -lives of
most men and women there certainly comes more happiness than sorrow.
And. health and love arid truth form the foundations of our gladness. Never
theless, pain has its ministry. It helps to make us men and women. It opens
to our view the hidden-meaning of realities.,. It _Âi s an experience, .moreover,
V'l UUI VIC" tile 1 1 1 ' it it 1 1 1 1 1 *<\ 1 i 1 11 Â£ ' Â» 1 1â¢- oÂ«f ii.m,o. iv po on .-Â»
that we cannot escape. Living means pain, and so does growth, and so does
joy itself.
"The cost of joy is Joy; suns fright the moon:
The rainbow hope dissolves in truth's high noon;
To-day costs yesterday in hÂ»^art and brain;
And love, while it may be called a part of happinessâ since in loving we
are happyâ yÂ«*t it is as much mure than this as the inlinke is than the finite.
Joy teaches only half the lesson that we must learn, and sorrow is no abler
as an instructor. It is through love that we come into possession Of our di
vine natures. Love is both joy and sorrow: it comMOM the clear-eyed vision
of the morning and the deep tenderness of twilight. As Goethe's Bettine
wild. "Love is a spiritual eye." It is our finer sight which, undaunted, fates
the starry mystery of unfathomed skies.
When we are happy, certainly we are increasing our vitality. A cheerful
spirit is the fairy's gift which takes us safely over the mountain of ice and
the sea of glass. But if you recall this sweet child's story by Mrs. Moles
worth to which I am referring you remember that the true princess with the
golden Vial Is went a long journey and suffered greatly, with love her only
guide and gentleness her only weapon, before she found the magic by which
to overcome all further difficulties of her road. She endured much, and, had
love not led her. surely she would have fallen by the way exhausted.
Endurance ia a matter of training of spirit and muscle. We grow by do
ing. We know our weaknesses and we develop our strength through failure.
The atmosphere of joy is nothing but a help, a beneficent influence, if it
works upon us from without. Of course, if it is within us it is more than
thatâ it is vital power.

A JOB IN THE SENATE CHAMBER
afraid you had gone from my life.
But pardon me, we cannot talk here,
and I have a great deal to say. May
I call on you at onee â this evening?
Is your father here?"
"My father is dead," she had man
aged to say. Her brain had been in a
whirl, her heart in a tumult. What
did it all mean? What was this im
petuous madman saying, implying?
By a strong effort she had controlled
herself.
"Yes, you may call," she had an
swered in a low voice. "Iâ l will be glad
to see you," and she had given him the
number of the house in which she rent
ed the small room.
"Thank you. I will be there early. I
would ask to go back with you now,
but I have an appointment which is al
ready overdue. Isn't it providential,
though, this meeting? I have been in
Washington only three days, and to
turn up against you like this!"
"Have you employment here?" she
had asked, for want of something bet
ter to say.
"Yes, temporarily, a job in tlfe Sen
ate chamber. You remember, I was a
jack-of-all-trades, from a farm boy to
an impecunious prospector, with occa
sional dabs at fresco painting and jour
nalism to help me through college. But
I will not detain you here in the wind
any longer."
She had watched him spring into the
carriage and drive away, an odd light
in her eyes and a warm color in her
cheeks. As she went down the sidewalk
she laughed softly. Eight years before
she would not have been like this. Evi
dently he was without any regular em
ployment, just doing s<mje temporary
work in the Senate chamber â fresco
painting probably, for he had spoken of
being familiar with that. At first, from
his beins in the carriage holding the
horses, she had thought he might be a
coachman waiting for htiÂ« employer's re
turn. But after all, what did it naat

Ed and honest and ambitious. She
could read that in his eyes and in the
strong, full grasp of his hands. And he
had remembered her and â and cared
for her. It was beautiful to know that
in the hurrying, indifferent world there
was one who still thought of her and
cared for her a little. The matter of
lack of employment was such a small
matter compared with that. Knowledge
of life soon leveled such petty distinc
tions.
Almost unconsciously her steps had
turned toward the Capitol. The only
alternative seemed a continuation of
her search for employment; and some
how she shrank from that just now,
even though she had been restricting
herself to a single meal a day for a
v eek. She would celebrate the finding
of a friend. It was opening day at the
Senate chamber and would be unusu
ally interesting; and perhaps she might
see this friend himself or some of the
work he had been doing.
There was a sudden stir in the line
ahead of her and she felt herself be
ing' pushed forward. The door was
open at last, and foot by foot, yard
by yard, she was being impelled
toward it. But when she entered
every seat was taken and she could
only crowd herself into the narrow
space behind the last row. She could
see the chaplain and a few of the
Senators on the far side of the cham
ber, and upon the few desks in night
a gorgeous display of flowers.
Presently she heard the opening
prayer and bowed her head. Then
there was a confusion of voices, with
quick, crisp sentences from one desk
and another, followed by a short re
emm, in which there was a great shak
ing of hands and introductions among
the Senators. At the end of fifteen or
twenty minutes some of those n the
visitors' paltery began to rise and

The announcement caused a
Srsat sensation at military headquar

Early this month Captain Harry C.
Kenson and Captain W. C Wren went
io i'osemite under orders from General
Francis Moore, commander of the De
partment of California, to select
nites for the camps of 'the Fourth
Cavalry, who are ordered by the
Government to act as patrol
men of the park during the sum
mer months. Captains Benson and
Wren went into the valley and located
several sites that would be desirable
for permanent camp locations.
Uncle Sam had made an appropria
tion to put up some substantial quar
ters for troops, and it was with this
ond in view that the officers in ques
i ion made a tour in search of a camp.
Captain Benson had ii" sooner selected
Mies than he was informed by one of

I'pon what ground the Park Commis
sion takes its stand is not known. It is
reported that there is in the treasury

$10,000.
Guardian Harlowe, who has charge
of the park, has just had his salary
raised from 51500 a year to $3000 per an
num. Naturally he wants to keep his
job. When the Government steps in he
will lose it. In the meantime the troops
of the Fourth Cavalry are getting
ready to march to the park, and if
Uncle Sam says they are to go into the
valley the chances are good they will
jro there. The Park Commission seem
now to dp apparently in doubt as to

At the Columbia Theater, com

comedy organization in Mr. Barry
more'B latest dramatic creation, Kid
Garvey, the gentleman pugilist, in
Augustus Thomas' latest comedy, "The
Other Girl." This attraction proved to
be a big comedy success of New York
last year.
The novel idea of a modern pugilist
is utilized as a leading character of In

athletic minister. The scenes are laid
in N>w York, representing the strata of
the modern whirl of life in that city.
The story, while furnishing an abund

touches of human interest in a unique
love story, which is the central mo

NO AGREEMENT
ON FRANCHISE
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday resumed consideration of the
petition of the Santa Fe Railway Com
pany for a franchise along certain
streets. Three or four property own
ers had filed protests against the grant
because their claims have not been
Fettled by the company.
("ajHain Payson, vice president of
the company, stated that he had of
fered H. Lehrke $70,000 for his prop
erty and JIS.OOO for that of P. .J. Tier
ri"n, hut that the two owners wanted
Sllo/MM' jn settlement of their d&ims.
Paysmi produced figures submitted by
real estate experts placing a valuation
on Lehrkes property of sums ranging
from $."6,700 to $65,500. Captain Payson
admitted he would bp willing as a
money lender to loan $60,000 on the
Lehrke estate property. Payson said
he did not think an agreement could be
reached with the protestants, though he
raised his offer for Tiernon's property
to $20,000.
Supervisor Braunhart contended that
the failure to reach an agreement on
damages should not be a bar to grant
ing- the franchise.
"The committee has never recom
mended a franchise until everything
hag been settled," said Braunhart.
"Very well, then, "_ said Payson. "the
franchise will not be reported back to
the board, as I see no chance to agree
on the claims. New protests are being
filed even at this late date, and there
seems to be no end to it. If we are
compelled to pay the higher claims we
do not want the franchise."
Action on the matter was postponed
two weeks.

MINE PROMOTER
SUES BROTHER
W.F.and Marie Patrick Want
to Recover $100,000 From
L. L. Patrick of Nevada
TROUBLE OVER CLAIMS
Tonopah Capitalist Denies
Suit Was Filed and De
clines to Discuss Matter
The complaint in what promises to
be one of the most sensational suits
of its kind tried here in many a day
was filed in the County Clerk's office
yesterday by W. F. and Marie Patrick
against L. L. Patrick, brother of the
first-named plaintiff. The suit is
brought to recover $100,000, and many
startling details regarding big min
ing claims at Tonopah and Goldfield
will be aired when the hearing comes
up.
The Patricks came to this city sev
eral weeks ago and registered at the
Palace. At that time there were stories
of trouble between the brothers, whose
rich mining claims in Nevada made
both men famous there. No one seem
ed to be able to get at the bottom of
the impending trouble, and nothing was
done in the matter until W. F. Patrick
and Marie Patrick filed the suit yes
terday.
L. L. Patrick left the Palace and
went to Tonopah a few days ago.
Since that time W. F. Patrick and
Attorney George C. Collins have had
many heart-to-heart talks and the
stories of trouble between the mining
men were verified yesterday, when
Collins filed the suit for $100,000.
NO DETAILS IN COMPLAINT.
The complaint is a very brief one
i and does not go into details regarding
j the case. It is understood that the
1 whole trouble arises over financial
; transactions the two mining men have
had. They managed to keep their own
counsel, and so the inside of the story
j did not reach the ears of the public
The suit has been threatening for
! some time, and it is understood a com
; promise was proposed by L. L. Patrick
| before he left for Nevada, His brother
I would not listen to any plans for a
â  settlement, and when L. L>. Patrick
1 went away without being able to ar
range matters the long-threatened
suit was the result.
Attorney Collins refuses to divulge
the inside of the suit. "It Jb going to
he one of the most sensational of its
kind we have had here for a long
timp." he said, "but I am not in a po
sition to give out thp details. We
have carefully considered the case and
think our chances of winning it nre
very bright."
STRANGK DENIALS MADE.
In spite of the fact thai the suit was
filed in his name, W. F. Patrick denies
emphatically that he is in any way
connected with it. He adds he gave
no attorney any authority to file the
suit, and says it must be some other
Patrick.
"1 know nothing about a suit," said
Patrick at the Palace Hotel last night.
"A fellow threatened to sue me over
a little matter some days ago, but so
far he hag not kept his promise."
â¢But," Patrick was asked, "is it not
true that a suit was filed in your name
by Attorney Collins yesterday?"
"I know nothing about it," was the
reply.
"But Collins could not very well
admit that such a suit was filed if the
facts were not true?"
"I know nothing about that, and I
do not want to talk ahout it," was
Patrick's r<*ply.

ager of the concern tmtil the Western
agents arrived here and looked the
ground over and concluded that in
stead of seven gentlemen undertaking
the direction of affairs of the depos
itory it would be better that the whole
management should be placed in the
hands of one man, the commission to
act as an advisory board.

Will Expend Balance of Fund.
Several ladies from the Century and
California clubs, comprising a com
mittee by which a special appropria
tion of $5000 to purchase comforts for
patients in the County Hospital is t6 be
expended, appeared before the Super

mission to expend a balance of $762

explained that it was desired to pur
chase underwear for the patients, to
be used during their convalescence,

HOLLAND SENDS
REPLY TO CLUB
Head of United Railroads
Avoids Question Asked
by Sutter Street People
WANT ANSWER AT ONCE
Citizens Will Meet Shortly
for the Purpose of Act
ing on the Communication
The members of the Sutter-street
Improvement Club will hold a meeting
next Wednesday night to again talk
over the question of compelling the
United Railroads to install an under
ground electric system to take the
place of the present Sutter street cable.
The members of the club are anxious
that some action be taken without de
lay. A communication was sent to the
president of the United Railroads some
time ago by the club and the following
reply has been received:
Hon. Frank J. Sullivan, President Sutter
street Improvement Club. 128 Phelan Building.
San Francisco â Dear Sir: We have your letter
of March 20, 1905, the body of which we beg
to quote in full as follows:
* "The Sutter-atreet Improvement Club re
quests your company to give a positive answer
on the question -. of changing the present : cable
system into an electric conduit system. An
answer before Wednesday next would greatly
oblige." â¢ .-'.â¢-.â :.- â â â -... -â ...â  -i-.; -./â¢"â  ' - â :
.We assume that by the expression, "present
cable * system." ' you mean the Sutter-street
system of cable roads, though just what
"question" it is' you desire answered .Is not
so clear. We do not recall any communication
from ; your club or any. of 'â ' Its officers other
than such as were orally. made on the occasion
Of two visits from representatives of your club
to this company. >_â Â ' " ; _ '.'
'â ; The first', of . these visits was by certain of
your directors namely. â¢â  -. Dr. . Rosensilrn. Dr.
Merrltt. Mr. Ha&ell and Mr. Sawyer. These
gentlemen were met < by the president, the gen
eral manager and 8 the general " counsef of this
company and the i matter . of thÂ« proposed , re
construction of the Sutter-street cable system
was gone over at considerable length. \ This
was about January 21, 1905. Shortly -there
after you did us the honor to call on our gen
eral counsel, accompanied by your 'secretary, â¢
and the matter was . gone - over again and th*
company's attitude carefully explained. -
iln addition to th* ; foregoing â¢ the .:, company
issued a public statement, which was published
In The Call, the Chronicle, the Examiner and
the Bulletin of Sunday, January 29. 1905. '
â  We scarcely know what can, be added to the
foregoing except to repeat â  that whether cable
or overhead electric shall be finally adopted as
the mode of reconstruction, the work will be.
as good as skill and money can produce and
the service the best - obtainable. Respectfully,
UNITED RAILROADB OF SAN FRANCISCO.

â¢ and. though the grounds

. a ded in and took
a <<vi of their wings. Every
man on the team is fit. with the ex
< option of Ike Walters. His old wheel
wobbles some yet, but he figures on
being in two-year-old form ere the
season is many days old. Gochnauer
has bidden his rheumatism good-by.
Its a last farewell this time, says
Jack.
Uncle's kids had on their new Sunday
ball clothes yesterday. They looked
sweji and each man refused to slide.
("aptafn Wilson wanted to take the
siiffnqss out of the swell togs, so he
ordered every man to dress up. They
did not have to be told to swell up.
That was accomplished, as a matter
of course.
Mr. Jaraes Whalen will do the tossing
for Hank this afternoon. James has
opened the season many times here,
and. San Francisco always wins. He
figures on getting away with it to-day,
as he did in other years. Captain Wil
son will wear the cage and the team
will line up against Seattle just as it
did against Chicago last week.
The Seattle team arrived last night
from its training quarters. Captain
Russell Hall announces his bunch looks
good and should beat the Seals. Either
Dick Williams or Charley Hall will
pitch. Th* Smashes are of unknown
quality this season, though they have
Johnny Burns, Bobby McHale and a
few more old familiar faces on their
lineup, besides several well-known
bushers.
While the Seals are busy with the
Si washes here. King Fisher will be. the
suest of the Commuters on the Oak
land grounds, while the Angels will
entertain Portland in the south.

BLOOD
<^<V^^^^S^^^^ "S. s s for the blood" has grown to be a
household saying. When the blood is out of order, or ,i
reeds treatment from any cause, this great remedy is the first thought of
and used by thousands of people all over the country, because it is superior
to all other blood purifiers. . It is a purely vegetable remedy, and while it
penetrates the circulation and forces out all poison and morbid matter, it
also builds up the entire system by its fine tonic effect. : During the win-

Sports Canvassing the Field
With Jabez White and Jimmy Britt
safely settled in their training quarters
the sporting men are already casting
about for ihe man who will nil the im
portant post of referee when they meet
in April. Although Charley Mitchell
has not proclaimed his intentions from
the housetops there is a suspicion that
he will object to Graney, Welch, Roche,
Wand, Smith and Greggains, the Cali
fornians who have done the bulk of the
refereeing here in recent years.
While Mitchell objects to a California
referee the club officials do not want to
bring out an Eastern man for the occa
sion. The one man who stands out
most prominently in this dilemma as an
available official is Jere Dunn, the vet
eran New York sporting man, who is
spending the winter on this coast.
While he is essentially a New Yorker
he has made a host of friends during
hi? stay in this city. He is friendly
with Mitchell, O'Rourke, Dwyer and
other friends of White and is also a
great admirer of Britt, with whom he
has spent much time since he came
here. He picked Britt to beat Nelson,
predicting he would outgeneral the
Hegewisch boxer.
Mr. Dunn has refereed more than 200
ring battles and shows a keen knowl
edge of the fine points of the game.
Those who know him best are sure
that each contestant would get all that
was coming to him. He was asked to
referee the Hart-Johnson affair, but de
clined on the ground that he did not
want to officiate where a negro was a
competitor.
Those who know Mr. Dunn's sturdy
character are sure he could not be ap
proached by any one to do a dishonest
act. His presence in the ring would
certainly increase the confidence of the
Eastern people in the fight. If a square
referee is wanted he .fills the bill thor
oughly. The fact that he is on the

grojnd is also much in his favor. The
boxers have until twelve days before
the fight to select a referee.
Hawthorne Club Wants Permit.
The Hawthorne Club filed an ap
plication yesterday for the profession
al boxing: permit for April, which the
Hayes Valley Club tried unsuccessful
ly to B ( ?cure last Monday from the Su
pervise rs. The Yosemite Club has
also ai plied for the permit.
If the Hawthorne Club secures the
in-portant sanction it will probably
match Nelson with Rufe Turner. This
would necessitate the transfer of the
scene of the Britt-White affair to Col
ma. I* would probably cut down the
receipts one-half to hold It over the
line in San Mateo County.
ENJOYS A NIGHT'S LARK
AND WIFE DIVORCES HIM
William J. Hickey's Escapade In a Val
lejo Schoolhouse Proves
Disastrous.
Because William J. Hickey, an en
gineer employed at the Protrero gas
works, enjoyed a night's lark with an
other friend and two girls in a Val
lejo schoolhouse, his wife, Louise
Hickey, divorced him yeÃterday. Mrs.
Hickey complained that her husband's
conduct on this and other occaslona In
flicted great mental anguish upon her
and the decree was granted on the
ground of extreme cruelty.
Minnie C. Iverson proved that her
husband, Christ P. Iverson, deserted
her without cause or provocation and
she was given a divorce on that
ground. Kuna Szmulowitz established
his allegation that his wife, Rachael
L., had been unfaithful and Judge
Hunt granted him a divorce. Jose
phine Billings has been granted a di
vorce from Orville Billings for deser
tion.
Nicholas J. Lindt has sued Minnie
Lindt for divorce, alleging desertion.
Georgia Zawod asks for a divorce from
Anthony Zawod for cruelty. Suits for
divorce were also nled by Agnes Pierce
against Stephen A. Pierce for cruelty,
Jeanette Williamson against Hector G.
Williamson for desertion, Thomas. Mc-
Combe against Elizabeth McCombe for
desertion and George Bellof against
Katie Bellof for desertion.

SPORTSMEN
LOOK FOR
FINE SHOW
Exhibition of the Forest,
Fish and Game Associa
tion in the Pavilion to
Embrace a Wide Eange
INTEKESTING DISPLAY
OF CHILDBEDS PETS
Collection Will Include
Turtles, Chipmunks, Gold
fish, Kabbits, Guinea Pigs
and Many Other Animals
A great array of youngsters with a
bewildering variety of parcels found
their way yesterday to Mechanics' Pa
vilion. In the bundles were animal pets
of every sort and description for . the
children's section of the sportsman's
show to be inaugurated to-morrow by
the Fore&t, Fish and Game Association.
The idea of giving the little ones an op
portunity to become a factor in the
success of the enterprise was a conceit
of Dr. P. W. d'Evelyn's and he has
aroused an interest that could not have
been incited in any other manner. The
pets to be displayed are of all kinds
and descriptions. There are pet white
rats, hens, squirrels, canaries, turtles,
rabbits, linnets, guinea pigs, goldfish,
chipmunks and a host of other unlikely
candidates for the affection of a child.
Many of the exhibits are in home
made cages and the entire section is
interesting because it shows the love
of children for living things. Each of
the exhibitors has been given a season
ticket and the particular corner of the
gallery devoted to this part of the great
exposition will never lack spectators.
While the opening of the show will
come to-morrow night when the com
plimentary reception is given, the real
ushering in of the two weeks' season
will be on Saturday morning. From 10
in the morning until 1 o'clock in the
afternoon children will be admitted for
10 cents on Saturdays only. The For
esters' Juvenile Band has volunteered
to furnish a concert during these hours
and special attention will be given the
tots, that they may have a good time
and also imbibe some instruction from
the exhibition.
Invitations for the opening Friday
night, when James D. Phelan, vice
president of the association, will de
li%-er the dedicatory speech and a prom
enade concert will be given by the big
band, have been eagerly sought and the
tickets are exhausted. iNo admissions
will be sold on this occasion, it being
the idea to give associate
members and other notables a private
view before the doors o? the wonderful
show are thrown open to the public.
Indian Agent Peter Paraquet and his
little band of Navajos arrived in the cityt
Tuesday and were immediately taken
to the Pavilion, where they will make
their home during the two weeks of the.
show. Tall braves, soft-eyed squaws,
children, clinging to their mothers*
skirts, and puny pappooses made up
the party. There was a grunt of satis
faction on all sides when they saw for
the first time the artificial forest in
stalled in the big building. A complete
camping outfit came with the Indians.
They also brought looms for the mak
ing of their famous blankets and tools
for the manufacture of pottery, toys
and silverware. The Navajos are the
industrious sort and will be kept at
work during exhibition hours.
Indoor tennis for the association
championships in doubles and singles,
coast wrestling championships, fly
casting and lure casting championships
and revolver, rifle and pistol champion
ships Will be decided during the show.
There will also be other athletic events
of a varied character every night. The
exhibitions will be limited in time and
there will be ever changing shows on
the athletic field in the center of the
pavilion.

Tennis Tryouts.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
29.â Final tryouts held yesterday for the
selection of a women's tennis team to
represent Stanford in the Intercollegi
ate matches wun uaniornia, resulted
in the choice of Miss Mabel Ray, '05,
and Miss Elise Owen, '07. Miss Owen,
as runner-up in the semi-finals, de
feated Miss Georgia Pitman, who was
a member of last year's intercollegi
ate team. The deciding match for the
singles championship between Miss
Owen and Miss Ray resulted in the
score 7-5, 6-4 for tho latter. Her vic
tory to-day gives Miss Ray possession
of the silver championship cup offered
by the Women's Athletic Association
of the university. She has held the
championship tfor the last two years.
Miss Owen played a strong game in
the preliminaries last spring, but was
outclassed in the semi-finals by Miss
Pitman. The date for the intercol
legiate women's tournament has not
been definitely settled. It will be held
on the Stanford courts some time in
April.

it will be Illustrated.
DR. LEGGO BEATEN
BY BOMBARDIER.
Bia Surprise in the Handicap
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
No fault could be found with the per
formance of Dr. Leggo in the $1000
handicap over one and an eighth miles
yesterday at Oakland track. Allotted
309 pounds, the three-year-old con
ceded weight to the half-dozen start
ers. llndÂ«r moderately good handling
ho was then beaten out half a dozen
lengths in a hard drive by Bombardier,
a 100-pounder and SO to 1 in the betting.
Bombardier is a horse capable of run
ning a good race when he feels like
it and when the track suits him. The
course was slow yesterday, and, vig
orously ridden by Tommy Clark, he led
from start to finish. On his recent races
the outsider did not look to have a
chance, and only those willing to take
a shot at the moon cashed any paste
boards.
XiGRETTE'S POOR LUCK.
Nigrette, which finished third, might
have been a keen contender at the end
but for some ili racing luck.
I FayoiitLS captured four purses. The
books did not lack patronage, and the
attendance was up to the standard.
Achelita, the Napa Stock Farm en
try, made a romp of the two-year-old
dash. Ridden by Tooman and a 9 to
10 favorite, the daughter of Libertine
ran home two lengths before Southern
Lady, the second choice. Third place
went to April's Pride.
Only last Monday Baker was favor
ite for a sprint won by Sun Rose. "With
Birkenruth in the saddle he ran
fourth. In the second event yesterday
Knapp piloted Baker and 8 to 1 went
begging. Sincerity Belle looked a cer
tainty, but after McÃride had finished
with his calisthenic exercises the
mount of Knapp had earned the deci
sion by half a length. Lloyd Foun
tain on Calculate was third.
HULFORD IS FAVORITE.
Seven owners resorted to the scratch
ing blank and Hulford went to the
post an even money chance for the
Futurity course selling number. The
gelding won in a big gallop, Albemarle
disposing of Yellowstone for the place.
Any price looked good against An
drew Mack, and Billy Cahill's horse
came home at his leisure for the mile
selling affair. Hainault, the second
choice, made the pace for six furlongs
and then lost the place to Stilicho, a
10 to 1 shot.
There is a late play in the ring at
Oakland that the form chart people
miss, and the judges as well. When
everything is apparently set and the
dealer is ready to spin the ball this
coin then comes to the surface. Dela
goa won the last race, backed off the
boards toward the last, but it is Solo
mon's mine to a rags, bottles, sacks
wagon that the mare had assistance.
If she did not, then what happened to
her in the handicap on Tuesday, when
every sharpshooter on the track played
Misty's Pride? In yesterday's race
Jones waited with Magrane until sun
down before moving up. Bell got
ashamed finally with Gateway and the
riding of Birkenruth, astride Judge,
was a nightmare and a delusion.
TRACK NOTES.
Tooman was the only rider to pilot
two winners.
Bullman and Birkenruth left for
Los Angeles last evening, where each
will have a mount in the two-year
old stake to be run to-day at Ascot
Park. The former will probably con
tinue on to Memphis, but Birkenruth
returns to Oakland.
G. W. Berry, superintendent of Napa
Stock Farm, was granted letters of
guardianship over Solomon Bonner,
the colored jockey, yesterday by Judge
Ogden of Oakland. The action was
taken with the consent of the rider's
father, a minister of Willitsville, S. C.
Bonner's guardian stated yosterday
that W. B. Jennings could have a con
tract for* the boy's services if will
ing to pay as much for the same as
other turfmen in quest of a pilot.

CREW OF C. A. KLOSE IS SAFE AT SAN PEDRO
Though the storm which went shriek
ing over this part of the world on Tuee
ingtit made a lot of noise and
1 considerable discomfort to those
whose business or pleasure kept them
out late, the damage it wrought among
hipping in the harbor was slight.
A few vessels dragged anchor, some of
â  harves suffered where floating
:ty had rubbed up against them
snd many of the passengers on tho
boats were seasick. Early in the
ng the wind, which had been
ng a gale from the southeast,
i round to the northwest, and
from that quarter it blew all day with
ng violence. Off the Farallones at S
k yesterday morning the wind ac
quired a velocity of forty-eight milc-s
sn hour. It was blowing flfty-six miles
an hour off Point Reyes, and off Point
J^obos twenty-eight miles an hour. The
I hers Fremont and Zampa were
not able to leave on account of the
weather, but otherwise the storm
' aused little inconvenience.
The big schooner Andy Mahoney, ly
ing at the east side of Powell street
wharf, was compelled to leave her berth
to save her sides from being torn to
pieces by the wharf. The gale poured
Us full force into the little bight where
the big lumber carrier was moored, and
every see threw the schooner with ter
rific violence against the wharf. Rope
fenders and bales of hay slung between
ship and bulkhead availed iittle to pre
vrnl the terrible chafing, and before
liie storm reached its height powerful
tugs dragged the Andy Mahoney into
the stream, where both anchors held
iier'safcly. Her starboard side tells the
tale of the hard rubs she received at
Ihc wharf.
ThÂ«? barkentine Fremont, which went
into the stream Tuesday afternoon to
allow her crew to sober up before put
ting to sea. dragged her anchor and
narrowly escapea collision with the
rodfishing schooner Zampa, which also
dragged. The Fremont's mudhook
â¢ -iupht the cable, and midway between
th' lorry slips and Yerba Buena. in the
very middle of the ferry fairway, the
barkentine swung all yesterday until
late in the afternoon, when to\v boats
helped to free her from her entangle
ment with the Pacific Postal Telegraph
Company's submarine property.
The barkentine Arago. at section B
of the seawall, was badly chafed on the
etarboai-d side, but weathered the
storm without leaving her berth.
The schooner yacht Josie was driven
ashore at the foot of L*rkin street,
where she lies a total loss. Both masts
were carried away and her port side
ripped out. A jigger yawl and six
pleasure boats were driven ashore at
the foot of Taylor street.
< "rew of C. A. KIosÂ« Saved.
ajuain and crew or the schooner C. A.
srMek was abandoned at sea in a
ogg-ed condition, uere picked up by
San Pedro. All hands are reported
The C. A Klose, after her abandonment,
â Â»as sighted by the steam schooner Chehalis,
â which tried_to. v w her to port. The line
p-arted. an4,<iaricneEÃ and rough weather pre
vented any further attempt to cave the dere
lict. ThÂ« tug XtauntlCES was sent out in
search of the Kloee. but soon after' the
Dauntless started word was received that the
jvicr* l^d turned, turtle and bad been thrown
by the sea. on the Oregon shore.
The C. A. Klose was abandoned on March
28. ten mile* off Port Candy. She was bound
from the Columbia. River for this port. Shortly
after leaving Portland she sprunk a leak,
filled rttpidly and soon became waterlogged
and unnanaevaMe. The crew took to the
rigging and remained there for a dsy and
a right. The Jv>larts Â»as lighted, and in
response to signals ran alongside the C. A.
Klow. launched a boat in the heavy sea,
end after many efforts succeeded in taking
off the derelict's crew. Captain Wagner and
the eijrtit men Â»-ho were with him on the
Klow are said to be none the worse for their
experience. Their sufferings, they say, were
very mild under the circumstances.
Both on Thrtr Beam Ends.
Two Brttlrh ships which left this port last
October for England and have reached their
<estlnatlT>nÂ» in safety were seriously damn*:' i
ebout the middle of March In a heavy hurri
cane. The Gunford, which left here October
27 fcr Liverpool, reports that on March 15
in latitude 47 north. longitude 18 west, she
wa> thrown on. her beam ends and before she
was righted a large I art of the cargo had
to be- Jettisored. â  The Thalatta. .which left
hero October 31 for Ipswich, encountered the
ssjr.e hurricane March 14 and was on her
bÂ«s4ii ends for forty-eight hours. The ship
and carjro were greatly damaged.

MYSTERY VEILS
OREGON FIRE
Supervising* Inspector Is
Unable to Account tor an
Ocean Disaster Last Month
NO CAUSE ASSIGNED
Opinion That White Lead, Oil j
or Oakum Will Not Ignite '
Spontaneously W T hen Apart
Unitd States Supervising Inspector
John Bermlngham filed his opinion yes
terday in the matter of the burning of
the steamship Oregon, Captain Fred
Warner, on February 27 fifteen or
twenty miles southwest of Crescent
City, Cal. The steamer was damaged to
the extent of $30,000 and the cargo to
$16,000. The following is an extract
from the opinion:
There was a considerable number of case* of
white lead, raw linseed oil and mac line (Ml, be
sides several bales of oakum, stowed there.
The oakum was etowed on lop of other freight
and not within four feet of the cas?s of oil
or lead. They finished stowing the freight In
tho after between decks about midnight before
the day of sailing, sa*-. thirty-six hours before
the discovery of tn* fire. No open lights were
used, but, on the contrary, large and closed
lights were employed, all of which were re
moved from the frelghtroom before the hatches
were closed. The fire charred some of the
deck plank laid on top of the iron deck, the
plates of which were warped in some places by
the heat, and the deck irames ppiung there
abuut.
Neither white lead, oil cr oakum will sepa
rately ignite spontaneously. Oil nnd oakum, if
mixed, might so ignite, but not at the tem
perature of a frelghtrdom in so shoit a time
us thirty-six hours. It is possible a lighted
match carelessly thrown on a bale of oakum
in her cargo by a stevedore o; a lighted clga
ratte so thrown may have been the Ciiiise of
thf fire, but that Is mere conjecture. There Us
nothing whatever In the evidence to establish
the cause or origin of the fire referred to,
which must apparently remain a mystery. Nor
is there anything In the testimony Indicating
in the least that any licensed officer of the
Oregon was in any way responsible for the
fire In question. Therefore. I must decide such
officers to be entirely blameless In the matter.
Sor Is it apparent from the testimony that any
of the crew of that vessel had any connection
whatever with the origin of the flre.
The efforts of Captain Warner, his officers
and crew are deserving o' great credit In
battling with the flre as they did constantly
for about forty-eight hours before It was finally
extinguished.

SAM HFLDRETH CM TRAIN
OX THE EASTERN TRACKS
Stewards of the Jockey Club Decide
to TJft the Suspension of Five
Years Ago.
WASHINGTON, March 29. â Sam
Hlldreth, the noted trainer, who was
told to go West by the Jockey Club
stewards five years ago and who has
been steadily refused a license to train
in the East each season, will be granted
permission to do so this year. The
stewards of the Jockey Club have de
cided he has been punished sufficiently
and in a few days he will be granted
a license to pursue his vocation. He
is under engagement to E. E. Smathers,
the Pittsburg millionaire turfman. The
cause of Hildreth's suspension from the
Eastern tracks is supposed to be on
account of a fight with John E. Mad
den at Morris Park.
A wise wife never reminds her hus
band of the fool things he said when
courting her.
SAYS POLICE FORCE *
SHOULD BE INCREASED
Acting Chief Spillane Files Estimate
of Appropriation Required for
His Department.
Acting Chief of Police Spillane yes
terday submitted to the Supervisors
an estimate of the appropriation
needed to conduct the Police Depart
ment for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1906. The sum of $941,680 is
asked for salaries as constituted to
day, of which $.46,848 is for 602 pa
trolmen.
Spillane says that under the char
ter provisions and estimating the
population of this city at 400,000. the
department should be increased by
the following additional officers:
Two hundred patrolmen. $244,800;
2 captains of police. $4800? 4 lieuten
ants, $6720; 16 sergeants, $24,000; 7

lice stations. $24,450 for miscellaneous
expenses; $3600 to employ two car
penters and one painter. Spillane
recommends that 15 horses used in
the department be condemned and
new horses purchased.
To obviate the expenditure for rents
Spillane recommends that new sta
tions be erected where the city has
suitable ground, as follows: Golden
Gate Park. $25,000; North End, $20.
000; South San Francisco. $10,000;
Potrero station, $25,000; Ocean View.

WANTS A FUND CREATED
TO REMOVE OBSTRUCTION'S
Commissioner of Works Aigeltinger
Urges Passage of Ordinance to
Commissioner of Works Aigeltinger
appeared yesterday before the Super
visors' Finance Committee to urge the
passage of an ordinance authorizing
the Board of Works to remove from
the public streets any materials, mer
chandise or appliances unlawfully
placed thereon; empowering the
board to collect the cost from the
owners incurred in removing the ob
structions, and creating a new fund
to be designated "Street obstruction
fund," and authorizing the payment
from such fund of the cost of labor
ar.d teaming employed in carrying out
the previsions of the ordinance. Aig
elfnger explained the difficulty in
rt moving obstructions because there
are no available funds to pay the cost
the:-rÂ»of. He cited an instance of fur
niture belonging to a family named
O'Brien, which was put on the side
walk in front of 8 Kate street by the
Sheriff. Aigeltinger said if a fund
hnd been created the furniture could
be removed, although he contended
that the Sheriff should take the fur
niture away. The committee will
take formal action when it compiles
the budget.

BALFOUR DEALT
ANOTHER BLOW
Opposition Has the House ol
Commons All to Itself and
Scores the Fiscal Polity
WAKMXG FOR PKFMIEK
Daily Mail Declares That He
Has Reduced Proceedings
Close to the Farcical
LONDON. Mann 29. -The House of
Commons apent another night in one
sided debate of the fiscal question. No
member of the Ministry was present.
Osmond Williams. Liberal, offered a
motion declaring that in the opinion
of the House grave injury would be
caused to the shipping industry and
other industries dependent thereon by
the adoption of the changes in the ex
isting fiscal system proposed by Josepn
Chamberlain. In the course of th* dis
cussion both the mover and Denny, thÂ«
seconder of the resolution, referred to
the condition of American shipping
and ship building as an argument in
favor of free trade. The speaker said
that British shipping and ship build
ing may be ruined by protection.
Maclvor, Conservative and tariff T9m
former, opposed the resolution on bÂ«*
half of the shipping interests of Liver
pool. He pointed out that American
duties on ship-building materials werÂ«
reimbursed In the cases of vessels built
in the United States for the foreign
and coasting trade. He said the rea
son America did not build mom ship*
was the higher wages prevailing tn tha
United States.
Rea. Radical, in responding said
that witnesses before the shipping
commission in Washington had testi
fied that drawbacks on ship-bulldln*
material were illusory and he asserted
that statistics showed that Great Brit*
am was not losing her position In th 4
ship-building world.
Osmond Williams' motion wan
adopted without division.
The opposition will have another
inning on April 12. Tuft (Unionist >
has secured by ballot the right to in
troduce on that day an anti-home rula
resolution, the terms of which hayÂ»
not yet been announced, but which it
In understood will condemn the utter
ances of both Liberal and Nationalist
members on the home rule question.
It is stated in the lobbies of the Houso
to-night that the Liberals will not
take up the challenge, but will re
fuse to participate in the debate and
divi3ion on the motion.
LONDON. March 30.â The Daily Mail
editorially this morning warns Balfour
that he is wrecking the party to save
the Cabinet and declares that Parlia
mentary proceedings have now been re
duced to a level which borders danger
ously near the farcical. It will be mui'h
better, the Daily Mail says, to face the
issue fearlessly and dissolve Parlia
ment.
Berber May Meet Rodenbach.
Boxer Berger is about to have his
fondest hopes realized. Rodenbach,
the only man who has a decision over
him, has practically consented to meet
him in this city on May 18 before the
San Francisco Athletic Club. Nego
tiations for the match have been penn
ing for some time and the bout ia
practically assured. Dr. Knipe and
Emery Payne, both Eastern boxers ai
repute, are also anxious to meet
Berger.
Berlin has ten homes for po^r girls
where the charge for lodging and light
is H 50 and $2 50 a month, and for
board and lodging $10 a month.

l'fie immediate influence on the call money
market was the placing of subscriptions for
the (75,<Xk>,Oou lnstaJlment of thÂ« Japanese
loan. Whatever precauuons may be taken
to avoid disturbance in the placing of sub

It is reported that large subscriptions are

influences eerved to check the advance in the

whether the subscriptions to the Japanese

the demand of the Japaaeo* Government. The
eucc^ssjul London Stock Exchange settlement
was an additional Incentive to buying for Lon

other strong demonstration, although the only

ctatomer.t of ret earnings for February by the

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, March 29. â Interest of traders
to-day centered in the corn pit. The market
was a. Me . affair, with profit : taking * by a ,
prominent long, the leading feature, v The sales
by - this one . trader are said 'to Â£ have ; exceeded
3.000.000 . bushels. -â  Influenced . by this heavy
liquidation â¢ pit Â» trader* â -â . became i short sellers,'
thus adding <â  to -an already . weak situation.
One of the chief reasons ' for : the ; unusual sell
ing pressure,: It -iÂ»/ claimed, was the : excep
tionally good weather conditions and the pros
pects of extremely early s corn , planting-. â  One
report claimed that . planting will be over In '
Central Missouri In two weeks. Another â  fac- >â 
tor, however, that Is eaid to; be exerting a '
powerful Influence ; on the '- corn market at the i
present time >Is the ;_ probability â of X a ;â¢â  heavy
movement from j Argentina in the immediate
future. : The â  market opened : steady, : with - May

The â  wheat " market -. was ; affected to . a : large
extent by the : slump ,In .- corn. A ? secondary I
factor -was ". the continued 1 excellent weather I
conditions and additional reports of the favor- !
able progress of " the growing-: crop. An optl- ,
mif tic report ! Â» from * Kentucky L was *> that more j
wheat will be raised In that ; region; than ever. 'j
While : the I acreage Is not , large. llt I was ! assert- |
ed that the condition '- of i the crop ;â¢ is r close â¢to '
100 and that' the weather is â¢ perfect. This re
port ' was supplemented *by ? one x from â ; Kansas
asserting that - the ;. total -â . acreage ;.â  devoted â 'â¢ to \
wheat Â»In that State |la 5 . per cent | greater | than ;
ever before and that =, the condition :of : the; new j

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market continued firm for top
quality table Burbanks. and fresh arrivals of
Coos Bay stock readily commanded an ad
vance. The_ cheaper sorts were still tn heavy
supply and dull at easy rates. Fancy Onions
were closely cleaned up and firm at higher
prices.
Receipts of Asparagus were lighter than
usual and a fractional advance was obtained
for a few lots of extra. The lower grades
cleaned up well, surplus stock being taken by
the canners. who paid 4#4%c for No. 2 and
5c for No. 1 stock. Rhubarb was weak for
the fceneral run, while fancy stock from San
Jose cleaned up readily at firm price* String
Beans were in increased supply and lower,
while other southern vegetables were generally
firm.

Deciduous and Citrus Frnits
Prices of sound Oranfes were well main
tained, both in the open market and the auc
tion rooms, but the market was lacking in
:--nap. as the threatening weather and the
heavy offerings at the auction caused buyers
to operate cautiously. Twelve carloads, in
cluding one car of extra fancy from Redlands,
were auctioned as follows: Fancy, $1 25@
1 S5; choice, SOc-g^l 40: standards. 50c@$t.
The choice and fancy grades were In good con
dition, while the standards showed conÃlder
nble decay. The other Citrus fruits were
quiet and featureless. Ripe Bananas were
more plentiful and lower prices ruled for the
Central, American article. Strawberries were
offering rather freely. Longworths sold at

Look over at Mount Tamalpais this

ful man. reported last night that tiic
Marin County peak was enveloped in j
a genuine snow storm. A white mantle

the Si.-rra all yesterday afternoon.
Cold weather is promised for San

terior of the State there will probably
be a frost. Professor McAdie sent
warnings 10 the fruit growers yester- â 
day morning to look out for a cold
snap.
The Sacramento River was quite
high at Rid Bluff last nlgrht, but unles>s
a fierce rain arrives to-day there will
be no danger of an overflow. The wind:-:
wore higher than normal Tuesday
niprht and all day yesterday.
At Point Reyes and at the Farallones
the wind attained a maximum velocity
of seventy miles an hour. The % gale
was intermittent- however. The high
winds were caused by the existence of
an area of low pressure over Nevada.
:?an Diego received a light rainfall
yesterday. Last night rain fell in San
Franci9<-o. The big: end of the storm
has departed tor Utah, according to
th? meteorologists.
IfcAdfe learned yesterday that
Professor Charcn of Xevada Univer

Marsh, had ascended to a point above
the 13.000-foot level on Mount Whitney.
In view of the projected establishment
of a solar observatory on this mountain

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Carlo Gustavino was father of a boy
â when he married Giuseppina, widowed
mother of two girls, and from the day
the quintet began dwelling together
the juveniles were cause ' of dissension
between the adults. Carlo's son com
plained to' his : sire that the' choicest
viands were bestowed upon ." Giusep
pina's daughters, and the latter filed
ccmnter-complaint- that they were
systematically nagged and. bullied by
their new brother. So it naturally
came to pass that Carlo ' and Giusep
*- : :: â â â â : â â
i Â»
piria found â their union less â  blissful
than it promised to be when they ap
proached the altar, '. that conjugal
â tiffs' became of frequent occurrence,
that Giuseppina finally threatened, to
return to single harness . via the di
vorce route, and that "Carter .declared
the marital tie* could not be severed
too speedily to suit him. -;â  c
Such was the domestic situation
when Carlo and Guiseppina and their
respective offspring sat down to sup
per last Tuesday evening in their
abode at 467 Filbert street. To dis
tribute the food was one of Giusep
pina's housewifely prerogatives, and it
was her discriminative buttering of the
bread that, provoked .Carlo, to violence.
He chlded.her for spreading the olea
ginous substance more thickly upon the
staff of life intended for her children's
consumption than upon the slice pre
pared for his son to eat, to which she
retorted with the words so vitriolic that
Carlo, stung to anger, sought to stay
the torrential abuse by laying on of
hands. She avers that he plucked the
bread-knife from her grasp and slashed
her neck, with evident intent to decap
itate, while he maintains that she ac
cidentally cut herself while lunging at
him with the. keen blade. The lacera
tion of her throat did not end the
duel, however, for two female neigh
bors, whose attention had been at
tracted by the sounds of the strife, in
formed Police Judge Mogan that when
they hastened to investigate they saw
Carlo and Giuseppina wrestling on the
front' porch of their domicile until he
secured a half-Nelson hold f and threw
her down, after which .he 'â  ' â¢ sat
upon her prostrate form .. and
briskly applied his fist Bto her face. It
was this disinterested testimony that
induced his Honor to pronounce Carlo
guilty of battery and order him to ap
pear for sentence to-day.

Mrs. Mary .Moriarty, denied the charge
in toto, and her cause was warmly
espoused by Miss Frances Rafferty,
who declared that never in all her
born days had she known a person of
more amiable temperament under any
and all conditions than was possessed
by the defendant. It was true, Miss
Rafferty added, that Mrs. Johnson was
a native of Ireland, and had married
a German, but surely that was no dis
grace, particularly as Mr. Johnson was
both kind and industrious, earning his
$22 50 a week, year in and year out,
and turning every penny of the money
into his wife's custody. If she (Miss
Rafferty) were matrimonially inclined
she would seek a counterpart of Mr.
Johnson, if such -were possible of ac
quirement. Indeed, to make a long
story short, the Johnsons were a model
couple.
A. B. Treadwell, specially employed
for the prosecution, asked Mrs. Johnson
if she did not provoke arrest and pun
ishment by calling Mrs. Moriarty a
"chippie," and Mrs. Johnson replied
that she might have done so, but really
did not know the meaning of the ap
pellation. "The truth is," said Mrs.
Johnson, "that this Moriarty woman
got a warrant for me because she knew
I was going to get one for her. And
you'd better keep your nose out of this
affair, Mr. Treadwell. I'm talking to
Judge Cabanlss here, and have no use
i r you, anyway. I'd have you under
siand that I could come to this court
every day for a month and have on a
new silk dress every time. Don't you
start a-knockln' me, Mr. Treadwell, for
even if my husband is a squarehead,
he's worth a dozen of you. So don't
you talk to me. Frances Rafferty ain't
the only one that can tell you who I
am. Poor Frances! Why, Judge, every
time she walks down the street this
Moriarty woman and her friends shout,
"There goes the rebel from Cork that is
fend of the Johnsons and has Panama
teeth.' How would you like, Mr. Tread
well, if people were to shout after you,
'There goes the big Indian'? Don't

presented â with the boa by an Oakland

John Joseph Sullivan, salesman, had
a habit of staying out late o' nights,

primed to visit upon her the customary
castigation. Instead of being con
fronted by her frightened face, how
ever, he was met at the door by her
two big brothers, who turned the tables
by giving him such a trouncing that he
was sent to the Emergency Hospital for
repair. Then they charged him with

to appear before Judge Cabaniss the

Max Goldman, tailor, dwelt in Oak-
I land, while his wife resided at 631 La
l guna street, this city, and during

responsibilities.

I When Aileen recovered her senses, she

himself a week for consideration of
what punishment he should deal out to

out of the window uttering shill crle^

available missiles at the gaping throng
below. Ere the officers reached the door
the lady must have exhausted all port
able ammunition, for the last objects
she cast forth were two small dogs,
which howled dismally as, grasping
their tails, she swung them around her
head preparatory to launching. Fortu

caught by humane hands and thus

he remanded her for examination by
the Lunacy Commission. She was ap

IMPROVEMENTS

Works Board Orders Plans
to Widen and Sewer Mis
sion and Fourth Streets
LEVY GETS A NEW JOB
Property Owners Charge a
Contractor With Fraud
in Obtaining Signatures
The Board of Public Works yesterday
directed the City Engineer to submit
plans and specifications for the follow- ;
I ing improvements to be carried out un
der the bond issue: Sewer in Mission 1
street, from Second street to the bay; ,
; widening and repaying of Mission '
street from East to Ninth; sewer iv
Fourth street, from Howard to Chan
nel; widening and repaying of Fourth
street from Howard to Channel.
The board opened bids for the paving
with asphalt of Mission street between
Onondaga street and Porter avenue, I
from the Barber Asphalt Company at
$G4,Blt> 24, and from the City Street Im
provement Company at 9CT.628 61. The
contract will be awarded to the lowest
bidder at a meeting to-day.
Louis Levy, deputy health officer, was
appointed secretary of the board during
the six months' leave of absence oi
Morris Levy. The last named Levy
said that it had been his intention to
resign from the position, but owing to
certain published allegations against
him as a city official he considered that
he was under fire and he would not re- ,
sign under the conditions. The board
was in doubt as to the legality of ap- '
pointing a new secretary during a leave
of absence, as it might invalidate a
number of street contracts. It was de
cided that all official documents would ;
be signed "Morris Levy, by Louis Levy
acting secretary." In all likelihood
Morris Levy will get an extension of
his leave or will resign altogether. In
the meantime Louis Levy will secure a
leave of absence as deputy health of
ficer pending the outcome of the suit
to determine the legality of his ap
pointment as such.
The Haslett Warehouse Company
was granted a permit to construct a
tiack across Second street between
Townsend and King streets for grading
purposes.
The Moody Estate Company was
granted a permit to construct a spur
track on Seventh street, between Irwin
and Hooper.
Joseph Poheim and Thomas Cusack
filed protests against the paving by J.
J. Dowling of Twenty-third street, be
tween Vicksburg and Church, on the
alleged grounds that the permit for the
v.ork was obtained by submitting to
the board the forged signatures of Po
heim and of J. B. Garland deceased;
that Dowling's agents have used
threats, misrepresentations and Intimi
dations to compel several of the prop
erty owners to sign his contract; that
Dowling proceeded to tear up the street
before obtaining a majority of the sig
natures of property owners; that Dowl
ing secured the signature of Mrs. E.
Schneider after the street was torn up,
and that the price charged for paving
is excessive. After hearing the protest
ants the board ordered Dowling to re
store the street In front of the prop
erty of Cusack and Poheim to Its orig
inal condition.
The City Engineer was requested to
file a report on the petition of the Sun
set Property Owners' Association that
the northerly half of H street from
Twentieth to Twenty-fourth avenues be
sewered and paved with asphalt, and
that a sewer be built in the south side
of H street under the bond issue.
The board ordered that Berry street
between Fourth and Fifth be paved
with basalt blocks.
Residents of the Potrero petitioned
that the railings on the Eighteenth and
Nineteenth street bridges, now being
constructed by the Santa Fe Company,
be safeguarded with wire netting, so
that passing school chijdren would not
fall through to a depth' of seventy-five
feet. The attention of the company will
be called to the complaint.
Bids for a sewer in Mission street,
from Onondaga to Amazon avenues,
were ordered invited on April 6, the
plans for the same having been
adopted.
The City Engineer submitted an esti
mate of cost for the grading of Fulton
street from Twenty-fifth to Thirty
seventh avonu's, which he fixes at
$13,500.

UNDERGROUND
LAW VIOLATED
Supemsors Criticize Hew
itt tor Permitting Over
head Wires to Be Strung
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday began an Investigation Into ;
the violations of the ordinance requir
ing all overhead wires to be placed un- j
derground in four designated districts. |
W. K. Hewitt, chief of the Department
of Electricity, was questioned at length j
by the committee as to the reason why
the overhead wires had not been or- !
dered to be taken down. Hewitt claimed j
that the Supervisors had on sev.n-al oc
casions suspended the enforcement of
the ordinance, but the committee said J
no such suspension had ever been or- |
dered.
Hewitt admitted that a permit had !
been granted to the San Francisco |
Electric Protective Company, a burglar
alarm concern, to string overhead wires t
to connect with the Central Fire Alarm j
Station. The ordinance granting the
company its franchise was produced I
and provides that Its wires should be j
placed underground. Hewitt said the j
overhead privilege was granted because I
the company did a telegraph business 1
and he considered that telegraph com- I
panics were exempted from the under
ground ordinance. Hewitt said that
the Direct, Bay City and Independent |
Messenger companies had been per
mitted to string overhead wires in the
downtown district.
General Superintendent Frank Jaynes
Of the Western Union Company d*Â»- I
clared that the ordinance was not being j
enforced, as five ot six groups of boys ,
who were not incorporated had strung |
overhead wires without permission.
"When we saw that othÂ«=>r people :
were running wires overhead," said
Javnes. "the American District Com
pany notified Chief Hewitt that it pro
posed to put its wires overhead aa the
cost of. putting them underground was
too great to compete with the small
messenger companion."
Hewitt insisted that a burglar alarm
system Is of the same character as a
district telegraph and messenger serv
ice and therefore could be permitted
under the ordinance to string overh-ad
wires. \
The committee wanted to know what
particular persons or companies were
maintaining overhead wires in pro
hibited districts, but Hewitt said that
the ordinance did not contemplate that
his department should keep such a list
as no appropriation had been made for
such inspection. Hewitt, however,
agreed to prepare a list so far as lies
in his power and the Inquiry went over
until to-day at 1:30 p. m.
The American District Company filed
a formal protest against the burglar
alarm company being allowed to put its
wires overhead In violation of the or
dinance.

The Supreme Court has decreed
