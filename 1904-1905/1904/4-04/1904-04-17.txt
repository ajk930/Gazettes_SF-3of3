CHAPTER XL
the noise of â¢ the Incessant clamor and
crash of the sea where the waves
pounded the' black seawall.
. When Kepneff woke me, his face "was
still dark, for the poor roan knew he
could riot weather that sea, and had to
tell me so. : And I saw at the water's
edge two ponies, saddled. I knew the
rest. â¢ â¢
; After two terrible days /and nights,
Kepneff 's servant and I reached Keln
riing. ' The first night we slept a few
hours in a deserted hut near a village
where we had. made an unsuccessful
attempt .to purchase new mounts. Our
two little Korean ponies broke down
In the middle. of the afternoon', and we
had pushed on this far afoot ' The sec
ond day our , experience . was similar,
though the ill-fed horses gave way
sooner on the rough; unused road along
the mountain ridges. We walked on.
At last wÂ« stopped on the summit of a
'precipitous ridge and built a fire.. My
man had brought a little rice with him.
and we put it to boil before trying to
push'ori to the nearest village. After
consuming our meager dinner, he went
into the valley to the brooki and after
a long absence returned.
' On a stone by our fire he placed two
freshly baked loaves of Chinese bread.
I was too thankful to question gift or
giver, though nothing could have been
more miraculous to me. Kepneff's ser
vant only smiled. At a> venture I
drew -from my belt a roll of Japanese^
yen arid he weighted them down with
a little stone on the rock beside the
fire.'.and;I felt that hidden eyes were
watching us as we passed away.
V -That afternoon . we procured more
ponies.' and at dusk passed the Imperial
Mausoleum outside of Keinnlng.
Howbeit. TOe'jneff had. not been will-
inpr to admit that ; the. relatives of the
desecrated dead could become Insane
until 1 they knew of the desecrationâ
and who knew of the destruction of the
Queen's body except its destroyers and
myself? Not one human being! Arid
would I tellâ or could they "make me?
In such wise did my thoughts turn
anxiously to those who had won the
game at the temple of Chlng-ling.
KepnefT evidently had no trace of them,
for he told me frankly that all had
been destroyed. I was sure that, had
he any" trace of them, he would not
have spoken in such a way. Evidently
their original plan to get possession of
the Queen's body had been frustrated
by thÂ« sudden advance of the date of
the funeral and by the arrival of Colo
nel LI and 'myself on the scene. But
after that, they had played their
forced hands desperately and well, and
my accidental escape was all that now
stood between them and. complete tri
umph. With an oath I swore into my
wet pillow that I would still thwart
their damnable, helUÂ»h-plot even more
completely than I had already! That
funeral must be postponed, and the de
struction of the Queen's body be kept
a i oral secret! .Here I laughed and
clinched my flstÂ«: the thrill of our wild
game was on me. and I was instantly
caught up in a delirium of daring
courses.
And yet some very sober thoughts
tamo to mo us the day grew brighter.
What of our Russian protectorate? As
I thousht of that phaee of the nffnir
things took on a different color. .It was
one thing to win f com Tuen by post
poning the funeral, but quite another^
thing to nak Colonel Oranoff to pcÂ«t-~
pone the announcement of the protec
torate. It certainly could not be an
nounced when the people â¢ wers just
cheated out of a holiday upon which so
many thousand hearts had been so lorig
and so fondly set. If the pageant were
postponed, Tuen'B men might easily
false the cry that Tuen had, after, all.
"pawed Que!parte. over" with success,
and the proof of it was that there was
no Queen to* bury. , â¢ ' j ' ;
But by the tirne our little boat had
beaten her way into the smooth course
of the Khan I had definitely, resolved
to telegraph Oranoff to â¢ postpone f.the
funeral;' this was the 'important' thing.
Other ..matters must adjust"; themselves
some way. And 'despite - my; mental
'. suffering the hours of quiet. had ;dbne
Â¦\ybriders for me ; I felt* stronger .than' I
had thought "I could, arid while; Kep
neff. protested : vigorously;: against;- my
'venturing out, I _had my^ way? and i was
soon â¢ striding^ up '.the j main Â¦ street v of
Han .Chow toward" the long,', low,^ build
ing to - which : the : zigsag .Hne' L of * tele
graph poles from " Keinnlng' led 'me.^' 1 ";
A boy sleepily, answered ,.". ray' sbout
and I entered' the 1 ! paper door into", a
large room which'. I saw Vat "once was
the operating room. ? '
"Can I send a message to Keinnlng?"
I said hurriedly..
Â¦The lad stood speechless... A voice in
the next , room spoke asurly mono
syllable, and the boy answered: .
"Yes."
I turned to the table and composed
the following: .'Â¦;
â¢ "Message carried by Cossacks prema
ture. Am re turning on Dulcette alone.
Postpone funeral indefinitely.-; Martyn."
After rereading, 'I:; rewrote" this ; in
cipher and handed i it to the : man who
" Iiwariied'to EhbcR the nodding head
off the" man's shoulders In my anger.
He was 7 holding the message in his
hands where he lay when I crossed the
room. The boy fled, jj In my. despair I
touched the Instruments, I fondled the
shining little bars. I opened the key
and shut it, each motion being re
corded on the; receiver. .Then the re
ceiver began to sing alone monoton
ously, and then,it stopped for a reply.
Sweat poured from my face, and I
thought of putting my mouth down
and of shouting my. message Into the
Instrument.] Then: I arose, crossed the
room, and kicked down the paper walls.
Cautiously the boy returned with a
man who could explain the situation,
and. from him I learned that V a new
"Minister of Interior" had recently ,
been appointed, and. to satisfy a great
host of relatives halfway down to the.
"eighth joint," even the telegraph ser
vice had to be invaded, capable opera
tors being thrown out and novices put
in* their places. They had held office
a month now, and not a message had
passed over the imperial Quelpartien
telegraph line. All this I learned as I
stormed, out of the building and down
th- straggling. street to the village.
Consider my desperate plight. A
hundred mountainous miles from Kein
ning, and out of connection with it, no
decent horse to ride, and the Imperial
funeral but four days off, not to be
postponed until I could come and de
clare that there was no Queen'e body
to bury! .
It eo happpns to a fellow spmetimesÂ»
(and happily for hla sanity) that fail
ure beepmes so overwhelmingly appar
ent that he -feels he is being led provi
dentially Into paths he would never
Â¦otherwise have entered. As I ran to
the shore' of the Khan and Ayas being

As I sat on the "deck *of -the yacht and
stared gloomily before 'me, what I saw
matched my sickening brain. We were
(while the great .< tide of the Yellow
1 Sea was out) thirty feet below the
high-water ; line. -A" thousand slimy
roots lay exposed to view, covered with
black/mud which slid; oft continually
and dropped into, the ' water below. A

were wriggling -back into r the river. 1

1 Then, silently, a change- came. .Our
"Yes, and the , King will breathe
easier when the body is in that marble
tomb."
. "He will be lucky to get It there, too,
against Tuen's bragging."
"Look at the banners," another cried
out ' suddenly. We had approached,
nearer the city than we knew, and be
side the gate great bamboo poles bore
silken flags announcing the imperial
funeral.' Â« .
"Oh, see the roof," a third traveler
cried out, at the sight of the green and
red flags and steamers which ran off
westward with the~ evening -breeze. As
with the gates, so with the streets, the
Bell House, the Legations,, the' Marble
Pagodaâ flags, streamers, pennons, ban
ners, .were everywhere, . and . my heart
sank lower as I watched each piece of
bunting ; rise* on the freshening 1 wind.
The v words of the countryman con
cerning. Tuen struck' home : hard and
quick, ~ and trebled every fear I had
known. . If alF. these thousands were
talking thus, what would be said when
the announcement of postponement was
made? Yet I knew, Oriental statesmen
were prolific in. excuses, and I; doubted
not for one moment Oranoff *s ability to
meet the n. extremity; Some reason
would be. raked up which would quiet
the people. The King might be taken
ill; we had him, and it surely would bo
"Oh, no; the owners are afraid they
will go insane if the grave* are dis
turbed, and so they,, pay large sums of
money to the government prospectors,
who move along . to ' the next wealthy
man on the list."
For a time there was silence as each
one pondered the matter, now and
then emitting a half cry and groan as
the plight of their poor country came
up before their eyes. - '
"The 'funeral has been lone delayed,"
Borne one put in after a continued si
lence. -
party KepnefTs servant listened tcjd
their conversation, and I asked him ~
what was said. After waiting a mo
ment, he repeated to me each travel*
er's remark In turn.
"We are lucky to get In before thÂ«
robbers are out."
"Yes, the robbers will do bir busi
ness before the great moon haa set."
The speaker looked back at us. and
seemed to feel more safe In our com
pany.
"We might as well bÂ» robbed by
highwaymen as by the rovernment, I
think," put in another of tha band.
Several laughed solemnly.
"Has the government been robbing
you lately?" asked tha first speaker.
"No, but it will get to us In time;
since the Americans found cold In tha
mountains the government has been
sending out men to locate cold mines
around through the country. They
came into Chuila province . last
month. They find out who the rich men
of a province are, and then go to their a
family graveyards x and decide that
there Is a large gold mine on that very
spot." A deep, querulous . growl arose
from each man in the company.
"But they don't dig the graves up for
gold, do they?" //'
Plans having been decided upon, we
went at once to raise the sarcophagus
I am sure we thought frequently of
the enemy by which we were surround
ed and of his plans, but of this no one
bo much as spoke. How old was the
conspiracy? How had it been effected?
Had the conspirators been warned by
confederates who reached Lynx Island
before us? Had it been disconcerted by
the sudden arrival of .Colonel Li? What
was the object of the conspirators in
assisting us to raise the sarcophagus?
These and a score of other questions I
oskfd myself, but. I could give no an
swer. Our success depended, I felt
sure, on the rapidity with which I
could get my Cossacks into this can
yon of Lynx Island. Of them' I was
confident and bo was LI; he did not
mention his own body of horse at this
Juncture cf our affairs, and I did not
anticipate that he would! However, I
fpit like kneeling: to the man. as he
etood there In the, temple, surrounded
by his trembling priests, to ask him to
forjrive ray suspicions of him.
A search for arms was instituted by
Colonel Lf, amd, knowing the thought
fulness of General Ling. I was sur
prised that the search resulted in pro
ducing but two guns. There were per
haps a dczen revolvers at our disposal.
But Ling, nothing daunted, put out his
gentries, who could, at least, give warn
ing when the assault came, and sum
moned all the others within the temple
walls.
Even to the most confused among us
come things were very plain. There
â¢uas now no longer hope of keeping the
sarcophagus secreted within the tem
ple, for every traitor had looked upon
it, and could find it again wherever
in that subterranean apartment we
mljjht stow It. Any secret there would
be readily unraveled. The only hope
was, then, to obtain assistance from
Nrlihout, drive away the villains, and
carry the earcophagus immediately to
the Dulcette.
Hcr.or and praise to those two brave,
faithful men on that night; not be
cause it was their last night on earth,
but because, brought BUddenly to bay
by the cruel foe so long feared, they
fehowed the stern Etuff of which they
v.cre made. In spite of the many as
perslor.s cast upon their race by the un
knowing world, I remember with awe
the courage of those men, and realize
something cf what millions of other
hearts may be capable of enduring,
though they be oriental and heathen!
Caught once by the deceptive wire
headdress. Colonel Li first determined
to thwart further danger from that
â¢source, lest there be traitors I still
among us. Accordingly, one by one, the
trembling priests were made to kneel
while their hair was loosened from the
netting where such 6trange 6ecreta
lurk. As the long hair fell down over
the face and shoulders of each, and
testimony of faithfulness to the King
came from lips parched with fear, we
all took heart to make ready a stout
resistance.
Alarm is net so terrible when an
enemy is located and the distance
measured. Despite the peril of our
situation, surrounded as we were in the
little temple of Chlng-llng by the
armed body of treacherous priests who
had been corrupted by emissaries of
the Chinese Prince, our fears were not
iÂ«o acute as hen, for a moment, each
if us looked the other In the eye, a
traitorous accusation on each stern lip.
As our suspicions cf one another
lifted, and we counted a score of men
left witb. and still faithful to, the treas
ure, a great weight rolled from my
heart, and I could Bee that General
Ling and Colonel Li experienced like
relief.

I Â¦ did not know what I was asking,
for the storm which had; cc-me down
upon Lynx Island was still raging
over the Yellow Sea, stirring. the mud
bottoms to their stagnant depths.
There was but one way for. Kepneff to
get me to Hah Chow, and that was by
running around the southern extremity
of Quelparte to the mouth of the Khan,
and ascending that river. It was a
desperate "risk, but he knew somehow
that we were at a desperate pass, and
without a -word to me, he Bet' the little
craft Into the teeth of the gale. . By
worrying cautiously, along in the lee of
the islands which lay between Lynx
Island and the mouth of '"the -Khan,
Kepneff, brave matÂ»,~.neared the- river
as day began to dawn. â¢ -
The tossing of â¢* the little vessel
caused.me excruciating; palii, and it
was only by bracing myself firmly that
I kept from rolling' upon 'my /injured
arm. ; But when, now and then,, we ran
Into smooth .water, behind the;numer
ous Islands, my thoughts -turned from
myself to the play In which' I was be
coming eo important an actor.
One thing was sure ' now. Dejneff 's
fine-spun theories regarding- one of
those absurd Quelpartien my thS" would
soon be put to the test. There was no
doubt about the destruction of the sar
cophagus and of- the; Queen's body
within it Now, if the myth held good,
the King of Quelparte was to "become
insane and his' dynasty": perish. I
smiled grimly as my thoughts ran on;
while , I , knew every sane . man would
agree with me and against ".' Dejneff
touching his silly belief, I had not ex
pected to precipitate any such actual
test as this! ' " -Â«i
For a whKe I could : not get; the con
nections of things, and now, and then I
saw that bear again.. But the world
came back clearly to me at last, end I
remembered with r groan the events
of the night previous â or had it all
happened weeks * before? \ 1; remem
bered.Lins^ and /Li, and pondered if
they were really burned 'klive with the
sarcophagun nnd their. faithful priests.
Perhaps, at the last moment, they did
escape, and the imperial 'funeral >, had
long since been celebrated and the Rus
sian protectorate successfully declared.
Or perhaps Ling had attempted to es
cape with the sarcophagus' and had
been cut down swiftly on the walls.
For sc-me reason I felt even now, that
the destruction of the temple, so long
and so cunningly planned, had been
accomplished.
Then suddenly my mind. jumped fev
erishly across the mountains to Kein
ning, whither my Cossacks had taken
that letter to Colonel Oranoff,, In
which I promised to be in Keinnlng
with the Queen's body within two
days! Here I groaned aloud, and, to
my surprise. Captain Kepneff arose
from a chair at the head of 'my berth
and leaned over me.
"If you are ablo, Martyn," he said,
with greatest scr.tlenees, "let us have
an undemanding at once, for with
Colonel Li gone I am under your or
ders. We found you on the rocks last
night while hurrying up to the tem
ple." ;
"Was !t destroyed?" I broke In. .
"Utterlyâan^ all within it."
"All?"
"Nothing remains but nehes and the
bones of those cremated."
I groaned alt-ad. A sob broke from
the fa<e nbbve mi. For ft time I could
not answer, and 1 listened. to the flab
by drum that was now starting; out
across the bay again . in search of
devils. But cs I listened my thoughts
ran on to the task now dropped unex
pectedly on my shoulders. I must now
do what Li would . huvo done, and t
tried to think what that would be.
"Will you telegraph to Keinning?"
asked Kepneff, gently.
"Yes. from Han Chow," I said, re
membering Oranoff 's words.
When I regained consciousness I. was
lying in my berth on "the- Dulcette.'
My headswas heavily bandaged,' "'and
I could. not move my left arm. v.I /found
this out by trying to do : so, arid for a
little time I was unconscious again. â¢.
As consciousness' returned once more,-
I lay. very still, thinking of my strange
dream. For hours, it ?seemed, I had
â¢been watching a bear walking slowly
over a great meadow of red and white
â the red portion steadily growing larg
er, for. the bear wa3Â»;bleeding. The
blood \viÂ»s spreading In" 1 all directions,
and I thought the animal was wounded
in the shoulder. â¢ This reminded me. of
something, but I could not for the life,
of me tell what it, w?.s; I thought I.
wrote It down, Intending to ask Oran
off. The bear went on limping .until
it came to the mutilated' body of a sec
ond bear, whereupon it- arose on its
hind legs, as though crazed' with grief,
and then keeled ever upon [ its back
and lay pawing the air convulsively,,
which set me to laughing. 'Â¦' This woke
me up. ' â¢ V
AT THE5 END OF THE SEA.
CHAPTER X.
This is the second in
stallment of "The Queen
of Quel parley' a novel of
the superstitions of the
Koreans and Russia's
secret intrigue in the
Far East â both of which
have led to the present
war with Japan. This
novel is historically true.
It is more fascinating:
than history because of
the thrilling love story
that runs through it.
You will get it complete
in four installments.
That means a Â§1 50 book
for 20 cents â an offer
uneqtialed anywhere
The treasure! What of it? I- knew
too well the -answer. There : waan now
no sacred â¢'sarcophagus. v :.There'"\waJ
now no body of the Queen to bury,
though a nation was preparing "for the
imperial pageant but five days 'off!
And the dynasty â it,, Â£6o.' was doomed
now with every kinsman of the . late
Queen. '
All this swept over me as I lay. in
utter darkness on the hillside'. Then^
on the land, breeze which came with
the' storm, I heard * the ' clatter -of
horses' hoofs on the distant'hills.
The signal of flame had been given!
My flying column of Cossacks, was off
for Keinnlngâ with .that letter 'of { good
news to Colcmel Oranoff. a "' â¢â¢" â¢ *
As I lay there, dazed, delayed ex
planations seemed to cc-me to my dis
tracted mind â explanations of all -tho
miscellaneous phenomena which ac
companied the complete triumph of the
emissaries of the ; Chinese Prince Tuenl
Then I thought of the good men^-God
have pity on their darkened "souls!â
who were being burned beside tha
treasure. . . .>' -. "â¢;â¢"
The temple of Ching-ling had been
fired.* â¢
"If I get through it will make your
son a captain. Let us not both die â for
his* sake."
Bo it came about that I attempted the
Journey down the cliffs of Lynx Island
that night, though it was certain, as old
Ling said, whlla he helped me get ready
that I was running a most murderous
â¢gauntlet. But in my heart I preferred
It to remaining in the temple. In such
times I am quite a coward if I cannot
be In action â many a man has led a
rout because he could not lead a
charge.
As I crossed the court In the dark
ness the nearest sentry was standing
still, listening, and Ling, Li and I
stopped, too. Now and again the
tramping of many feet approached the
wall, retiring immediately, but to re
turn again. It was quite unintelligi
ble to me, but I noticed the men were
anxious that I be gone. I crossed to
the farther wall, where all was Btill.
As the sentry without trudged by to
ward the corner, I sprang upcm a
straw-thatched roof and climbed from
it to the wall, where I lay down, look
ing over. Nothing was audible save
the tread of the returning sentry. His
head was five feet below me. I leaned
further over to add my arm's length
to that of my sword. Unconscious of
his peril, the fool walked under me.
and then sank lifeless to the ground
without a groan.
I fell after him and not an instant
too soon, for at, that moment a form
came quickly to 'the corner and, utter-
Ing & Blngle but piercing exclamation,
fled into the darkness. I stopped once
to listen. All I heard was the sound of
rolling stones started from their places
by iny feet.
But it was not my duty to inquire
into the method of the campaign con
ducted by the besiegers of the temple.
My duty was to get my Cossacks at
the -earliest possible moment, and I
ran on to the crest of the canyon, where
I paused, to breathe before risking my
life on the cliffs below. The hillside
was all rocks. One by one I reached
for them and slid and fell forward to
the next, sometimes with good fortune,
but more often evil. Now and again I
paused in my flight to gain. my breath,
or measure the extent of my latest in-
Jury. V' : '
I must have been more than halfway
down, for I had fallen again and was
lying quite helpless ? where I fell,
watching the lights on the yacht be
low me, when a dull, unearthly roar
sent a million echoes ringing through
the rocky canyon, and reverberating
sharply among; the hills beyond Wun
Chow. A HghC as of a . descending
comet, suddenly lit up the thunder
heads over Lynx Island; then the
dulled glare of burning buildings filled
the sky.
LI. who knew me best, yielded first;
then Ling acquiesced, but inconsolable,
as one could well see. I guessed at a
selfish reason and spoke to him, and
what I said struck home.
"Faugh!" I burst out. partly for my
own encouragement (for Li's sugges
tion would have daunted a more head
strong man even than myself}, "I do
not fear the cowards. Moreover, a for
eigner would fare better in their hands
than a native."
The good man raised his hands to
object, but I would not let him inter
rupt "I can get through if another
can," I continued, "and, c-nce through.
I can quickest get our yacht into ser
vice and reach Wun Chow and- my Cos
sacks."
"But, sir," broke in rough old Ling,
"you are more likely to drop dead in
your tracks once over the wall."
"As well dead there as here," I said.
as gruffly, i
"Or captured alive andâ" This .was
from Li. -He did not finish, for he saw
me start.
to the temple area, ready to be trans
ported at the moment of the arrival of
assistance â If. indeed, assistance
should ever come! We mustered twen
ty men, four of the priests belonging
\vithln the temple walls" having bolted
out of the gates with the others, now,
doubtless, prisoners, though I thought
Ling and LI were secretly hoping: that
they had gone to summon help.
The work went on more rapidly than
I feared It would, the aperture above
the box being found quite completed.
Slowly we lifted the dead weight by
cheer 6trength of arm ami shoulder,
end, once In the narrow hallway, we
made a quick Journey to the second
opening, and there lifted it again. Si
lently we laid the treasured coflln of
the Queen in the area of the temple.
Â«.nd covered it with a drapery made of
the great curtain which had formerly
hung before the inner court.
This done. I bethought me of another
duty, and quickly let myself down Into
the lower hallway, hastening toward
the bloody antechamber. As. I de
scended the stone steps the ekirt of a
Quelpartien robe disappeared through
the door toward which I was hurrying.
Placing my hand on my revolver I went
on without flinching. It was General
Ling, moved to come here by a similar
motive. Together we moved the bc-dy
to the bed, and Ling (for I could not)
arranged It in proper position there.
He then came out with me, and de
scended the wide stone steps weeping.
I made .a hurried round . of our
guards. All was quiet- No one had
appeared, though we could heir foot
steps of sentries without, walking
guard about the walls, and now and
again we heard stones rolling from the
Fides of the canyon: when it became
evident that our court was being
watched from those heights, the carry
ing of torches was forbidden.
I returned to the temple. I had con
sidered the whole situation and had
(tetermined, myself, to make the at

entered, and I found I had been antici

THE QUEEN OF
QUELPARTEDulcine w<u> humming the song of
the Widowed Wild Goose. After a time
Dejneff sauntered- in' again arid flung
himself down into his chair. Soon he
too was humming the song, ; and I
wondered If Dulcine had told him that
I had put the Queen's body in the sar
cophagus. As soon now as I could I
was determined to tell Dulcine. the
whole truth: But I decided to wait
until Dejneff was out of hearing.
Yet as I waited another step sounded
at my bedside and .i; knew Colonel
Oranoff had come from the King.
"What does all this, mean?" he said
If It seemed that I was unconscious,
I was not. I knew well enough when I
was tenderly gathered up out of space
and *)orne to my bed again, and I knew
when the doctor came. He was a good,
faithful man with a beard like Dej
neff's and a gentle voice. I heard,
some time before, that all the food the
King had eaten for months after the
murder of the Queen, when he feared
that Tuen was attempting to poison
him, was prepared by this man's hands.
The medicine he prepared was admin
istered by my faithful , nurse" Dulcine,
who came as soon as I had been put
to bed. The medicine made my head
stop ringing and I ' lay still; thinking,
for I could not sleep.
A NEW PROGRAMME.
CHAPTER XIII.
M. Grouchy, the Russian Minister to
Quelparte, was standing midway down
the table addressing "the throne" amid
cigarette rings which the King of Quel
parte could blow as well as any wise
man. The members or the cabinet
were leaning forward from their chairs
In varying picturesque attitudes. In
tently listening to the address.
"Within two days," M. Grouchy was
Baying, "this decree of your great and
noble King will be given to the people
of Quelparte through the government
Gazette. It is an auspicious time. The
nation is enjoying a memorable holiday
and the happiness they must feel at
coming at last under, the protecting
arm of the Czar of all the Russians
will dispel in part the gloom which they
feel at the burial of their beloved
Queen."
As Grouchy proceeded, my eyes were
still on Oranoff. He sat quiet as a
shadow while his underling spoke as
he had directed, expanding on the bene
fits to accrue to Quelparte from Rus
sian rule: Oranoff never did his own
talkingâ he attended to the rest, with
others to do that for him. â¢ .".; : V, ;
"Russia has been the boon of Asia
and will be all that and more for Quel
parte. But we do not desire." the
trickster went on,,' "to hold Quelparte

The great room was brilliantly
lighted. At Its end, on that mottled
throne, sat the King of Quelparte, his
cabinet ranged before him in an ex
tended semicircle. On his left at a
small table sat Prince Ting, the Prime
Minister. Behind Prince Ting stood a
group of household Ministers. On the
King's right Colonel Oranoff was
seated at the head of a long table, his
head in his hands, his elbows thrust
characteristically Into a mass of papers
and maps. To him my swimming eyes
went quickly and there they rested
long. â¢

Spread wild rumors, no doubt, but how
eoqld they prove them? Who would
dare question, by. force, the burden" of
the Â¦; royal 'catafalque? Or who would
propose to examine the contents of the
royai;bier? These things were out ;of
the question.
Yet there were risksâ I did not try
to persuade myself otherwIse-^-but they
were inconsiderable to risking the pos
sible failure of the Russian coup In
Quelparte and perhaps a more terrible
expose which might come with delay.
A delay would lend a bad color to any
rumor Tuen's agents might circulate.
As for an attack on the funeral:pro
cession itself, I would trust Dejneff to
take care of that! The whole army
was to surround the bier, and if such
nn attack were made and were success
ful, the sarcophagus would be found
empty and It would be no task to have
It understood that the body. had been
carried In ; the royal palanquin or in the
casket prepared for the memorial tab

As Pak made ready to /leave I

I found myself stronger in the morn

Pak had caught the wrong .word again.
But my laughter did not discompose
him as it did when he was first in my
service, and he continued:
"Yes, HuMok is very, wise, and he
braids his eyebrows and hangs the
braids over his ears.",
"How doVs.he tell what's the matter
with people Pak?" 'Â¦
; "With hi* magic stone; one day Hu

he came back the day after he brought
a stone so bright that you could look

- "Use it as a looking-glass, Pak."
"Yes. you could see yourself in it;
when any one is sick, Hu Mok comes
and puts the stone on them and pretty
soon hV can tell where they are sick
and what is the matter."
"Then I don't want Hu Mok, Pak,"
I replied firmly and with great truth,
"for I don't want Hu Mok or any one
to see inside of me now." ' C-^
That was as good as I. wanted.
Once more * in my room ; I . dismissed
Pak with a stern : injunction as . to se
crecy /and enough silver to make him
"quite the reverse. Then I turned eag
erly. to # my; task. . -
'â¢ ' Now,- it : is trite; beyond hope of- ex
cuse to remark that some. things seem
difficult I nearby which at ; a distance
and off-hand seem exceedingly easy.
I. remembered, with what force this con
clusion: was .impressed upon ;me that
night at ' the . Russian Legation in Quel
parte, where, I, attempted*. to cajry out
my,- resolution : making, a counterfeit
queen to replace the real Queen; that I
had ' lost on Lynx Island.
For a time I v walked around my ; bed,
which was I loaded iwith the ; silks Â¦ Pak
had' deposited there^ at my order.- Then
I . sat ' down and 'Â¦ pawed ' them", over gin-"
gerlyn while : the truth of /"the afore
mentioned Â¦ observation "came home to
me with { added ; , emphasis. ; Now
then : I "got together,"- to : use\ a \ phrase
moreVexpressive .to ; some \ than , ,to/oth
ers, arid made , a . fresh start ; but every-,,
thing I 'got . niy ' hands Â¦ on next "seemed^
the most ? absurdly "impossible thing to
begin- with*. SQpQPHHI
/ Finally I despaired of doing' anything
with* my material" en masse, r whenVthe
creditable Â¦ idea ; occurred to; me Utb sort
out the ; articles - an'd hang}, them .where
I â¢ could fg'et , a: moro'esmpreherisive^no^
,tion of their shape arid; size;.- and soon
chairs/. bed-posts, i tables'; pictures and
mantels v were "alive with "the; fantastic
robes of a' wealthy Quelpartienne.
Then I went out into the night and
made my way to^the Bell House, to the
great- booths where the be'st of native
garments were for sale, taking Pak for.
a : guide and interpreter. I to'.d him on
the way what I wanted.
Soon ' we were being ihown ; i , large
assortment cf fine silk; outer garments
Worn by the women '.Â»jf Quelparte.
Pak's eyes glistened as the great pieces
"of "silk â¢Â¦were thrown by. the cunning
hand of the merchant before our eyes.
I, of course, knew nothing of them, not
even their quality, but as this was the
only thing about which I cared, I asked
Pak concerning it)
"He says they are good enough to
bury the Queen in," replied Pak, sim
ply/after a* word or two with' the mer
chant.
"There's but a step between the sub
lime and the ridiculous," I quoted so
berly as I dressed for dinner; "I shall
diminish that distance by half before
morning." \ My shoulder was very lame,
but otherwise I felt able to resume my
accustomed place in the life of the le
gation. At Â¦ any rate, - 1 knew that my
new plans would necessitate my going
out; I was only preparing for emer
gencies.
. The ladies had not returned from
their sight-seeing,* and" I was spared
playing hero: I made way with the
courses as . rapidly as practicable
against their return. But I did 'not
leave the room- without placing a note
under Dulcine's ring, encouraging one
of the table-boys with 'a' coin to see
that she did not miss it. I a".so left
word with Dejneff that I would be
ready for duty as usual in the morning."
1 saw he was not sorry to'.ba able to
depend upon me to command the troops
around the bier; for he was. to march
with the King, and Andorrh was to
guard ' the mausoleum throughout the
night and day. I also saw that peJnefC
would not cry either wheti this pageant
was over safely!
Â¦ But the effect of the girl's words and
all the depth of their deceit was even
more marked upon the man who lay
on Â¦ the bed before her. ' And as I
looked covertly upward Â¦Â¦Â¦ for the brief
second during which - the film of my
memory was exposed to thi3 picture, I*
became thrilled until every unstrung
nerve throbbed and then was steeled. I
saw more clearly_than before our ter
rible .plight, and saw my duty clearer
too. Yet through the vision there came
courage and to spare!
But nowâ when I was In too deep to
get out, when it was too late even to
consider owning up^, to the truthâ I
found : that the 'King himself must look
into the. empty casket and close with
his own thin hand its golden lid.
I met this new shock with far greater
courage than any preceding one; now
I was driven only one dye deeper: a
form resembling a human body must
meet the King's eyes!
. I arose, smiling grimly, from the bed
upon which I had \ fallen with a groan.
There was something ridiculous in this
resolution which was the logical end'of
my. deception, and the reckless daring â¢
of it fascinated me. .
Â¦Â¦',- There are times when we know ; a
crisis has been passed, but it . is rare
that we know * the* exact moment of Its
passing.
As' I look back from the end to the
beginning of the story I remember
plainly âaye, best of allâ the moment
when Dulcine Oranoff raised her proud
head and repeated to her father my
desperate lie. It was impossible for
the: girl to think I had failed. Then,
where else could the Queen's body be
but in the, casket prepared for it?
"I am very far from sorry that my
eyes were not firmly closed when Dul
cine uttered those thrilling words, for
If I . have one picture of her more
worthy of the admiration of the curi
ous than another, '> it is that of the
lithe, trim girl fingering the lace of my
pillow as she looked straight over me

of .magnetic power, a vcniRtJ to darj
and do, y and make others llkÂ» herself.
I would have wondered that Colonel
Oranoff could take > those startling
words at full face value, had I not seen
the firm; true lips, the steadfast eyes of
the one who uttered them and believed
them to be true. '.Seeing this. I won

DULCINE.
CHAPTER XIV.
This King was no novice and no fool,
and he had a pretty wit all his own.
"He has a son in the army. Sire," I
said, keeping my promise to old Ling
most unexpectedly, "as faithful as his
father; I pray you to remember him."
The King instantly turned to Prince
Ting and said:
"Appoint Kim Ling to his father's
former office as secret guardian of the
Queen." "
I felt Oranoff f s eyes burning' two
holes in my back and I hurried on with
my wretched story, for, as the King
lived, I now had to hold one eye shut
to keep from seeing two of him.
And I knew the strength the liquor
gave me was all the strength I had.
"Colonel LI was '.ost. too." I mur
mured, holding desperately to the car
pet to keep from falling off the floor.
"Ll lost!" spit out the King of Quel
parte, suddenly; this affected him.' "It
must have been a sudden fire."
"It was. Sire, God knows It was sud
den, but â " and here the King broke
In again with another, gay laugh and
cut off the words which were on my
parched lips.
\l could not hold to the carpet any
longer, and so with a hrppy sigh I let
go and went out Into space.
"Accidental fires are sudden some
times,*' I heard the King laugh. But I
was too far away now to answer. \ I
heard much cheering, which sounded at
a great distance, but I could move
neither hand nor foot, nor lip to tell
either the truth or any falsehood.
"No, he did not swim to Tsi," an
swered the girl, proudly; "he came
overlrr.d." f
"And the Queen's body?" the man
cried out; "did he dra's it over the
mountains behind him?" I did not
blame the man for his sarcasm; my
silence at such a crisis had been cruel.
"The Queen's body," said . Dulcine
Oranoff. composedly, "is where .it be
longsâIn the new sarcophagus."
Oranoff repeated ; those startling
words like a man in a dream; then he
asked. "Do I understand you, Dulcina?"
She did not reply, and he spoke again
as If the -room were empty. "He
brought it overland because the little
ijboat I sent could not weather the
gale."
What I had passed through in the
last week was nothing to this â was
"nothing beside 'the stinging of those
gentle words which were so much to
my credit. When the man went out
of the room, a head sank on the pillow
beside my own and the bed trembled
as the realization of my position came
over me. It was a positive relief when
From the moment! she . had uttered
those words to Colonel Oranoff my
course was clear. .1 had done my best
to bring ' the Queen's body. . Failing I
had then done my^best to send an ex
planation, and-have the funeral post
poned. Failing here also, I had come
as fast as human strength permitted
to arrange at the last moment for a
postponement of the pageant. J; I had
lied outrageously to â¢ Dulcine, never
thinking that the lie would be passed
on. But now, since every one thought
the Queen was safely in the ' sarcoph
agus prepared '. for herâ let . them go on
with their parade and show!
Who would know the difference?
No one but myself knew that the body
had been, destroyed,, save only the'
â¢wretches. wh6 destroyed it. I had been
taken Â» first to the anteroom where the
sarcophagus was, and with my own
hands I had closed its golden ' lid. i The
very daring of It .was the ' salvation of
the plot. The faster. I thought,' the
more ; reasonable It" - all seemed. The
body was lost Deybnd all recovery, and,
after all, what /would delay or.'post
ponement accomplish?' Nothing, .per
haps, unless the terrible Â¦ denouement
that ; there was no Queen 'to bury! ; r?
": Then, too, the Russian protectorate
was at stake. ; Nothing would be surer
than the "Â¦ failure of \ Oranoff's coup :â¢ if
the loss of the Queen's -body became
known.
The pageant must go on!
Then I remembered ; ,Tuen,.\ and I
clambered r out ' of ; bed ; a t the '-Â¦ thought
and ' went { striding * up> and down \ the
roomâ a ' human ship '] In } distress ! . But
I laughed - as ~ I 'went and clinched . my
fists I again,' even 'as ; I did > in; my berth
on "I the pulcette.- : . This ; ; would *" \ be
balking the devils that 'checkmated "me
that night - on Lynx > Islandâ to Â¦; have
the '. funeral "go on." Queen's * body ' orrrio
"Yes, Sire," I answered, glad ' to find
I could talk if I could noi walk, "the
temple of â¬*ing-Ilng has" been de
stroyed." Then I added, eager to bol
ster up my string of lies with one un
doubted truth, "It was 'burned to the
ground and lies in ashes.".
"Ah," sighed the King of Quelparte,
with admirable affectation; and then,
just as I was opening my 'mouth 'he
turned to Prince Ting (evidently not
wishing his cabinet should guess that
Lynx Island was to pass into the hands
of the Russians), saying: *
"Orders must be issued to all our sa
cred temples regarding the. danger
from fires" and the removal of all com
bustibles to a safe distance, and let it
be known that no temple destroyed by
accidental fire shall ever b*e rebuilt."
The wine on my empty stomach was
at once my friend and my foe. It
gave me strength, especially of sight!
I felt Oranoff's eyes on my back, and I
broke out for fear I could not speak at
all soon:
"General Lin? was burned with the
temple."
"Ling lost," echoed the King, holding
his head sideways to avoid the smoke
of his cigarette. "Faithful Ling; he
was such a man as kings need â some
times." He leered significantly toward
Oranoff as he said the words.
without a single word of introduction.
His voice was low and tense. ,_ Coward
that I was. i" did not .move, 1 and Dul
cine answered simply:
"I do not know, father; It was a
hard trip to Keinning."
"Did he swim to Tsi?" was Oranoff's
reply, and the words were almost a
groan; "the Dulcette did not bring
terminated at any time by either gov-'
ernment. It will be the purpose of my
government to study, during the follow
ing days, the sentiment of the people
of Quelparte. and if it Is found that an
alliance with Russia such as we have
signed to-night is displeasing to the
people of Quelparte, Russia will imme
diately-withdraw from. the agreement
and remove the officials whom â¢ your
King has aopointed to high office."
With such words M. Grouchy paved
the way to throw. Quelparte over to
Japan when the lease of Port Arthui
MWjj announced.
I Had entered the room v-lthcut at
tracting attention, and I stood by the
door listening to the Russian's* words.
It was clear that the news brought by
my Cossacks had put 'all in good cheer,
and that the funerafwas to come off as
liror-osed. beginning day after to-mor
row. I had been blinded by the bril
llani light in the room, and the scene I
have described came to me slowly, and
no other picture has 'stayed .with meâ
save oneâ so perfect in detail and color.
Totally unbalanced as I must have
been by fatigue,. -Â«id ' desperately
drugged with wine, I remember turning
from the bright light and wishing that
I could, after all, tell Ivan Oranoff the
truth. But even as I reached helpless
ly to the wall for support, the hilt of
my sword went clanging against it
and every face in the room looked my
way.
I believe the King himself recog
nized me first or at least saw me first;
he rose and pointed the fire-tipped end
of his cigarette toward me. The cabi
net arose, and M. Grouchy ceased his
remarks. Of these things I am a little
uncertain, but I am not at all uncertain
as to Colonel Oranoff. I knew well
enough iVas late â later than I should
have been without telegraphing him
the reason of my delay at such a time
as this. I also knew that my report
should have been to him, not to the
cabinet or the King. The man drew
himself slowly to his feet and leaned
over the table *upon his hands heavily
as I came swaying through' the long
room.
I had not dressed for the occasion,
and my bedraggled appearance and un
steady deportment evidently added lus
ter to the heroic role I had suddenly
chosen to assume. The King put his
cigarette in his mouth and began puff-
Ing and clapping his hands. His no
bles, mimicking him in -everything 'on
peril of their lives, , took the cue -and
applauded me vociferously, and I stag
gered on to the foot of that _"throne"
(I could not have gone another, yard
for the King's crown), receiving . an
ovation rather than the thrashing I
deserved.
"The temple of Ching-llng has been

Martyri?" " -
'â¢% I â¢ had gone over toward . my bed
while Dejneff told me these things, and
stood there' dazed f I was glad the room
had not' been 1 lighted. Dejneff could
not see me.
"No, old man," I replied, "you go
on; I believe I'm; not hungry."
When he was but of the" room I fell
upon- the bed with a groan.
" The ' King was to '. Iook. into my
empty' casket!
Yet there in the firelight I told It all-
God helping meâ all, the whole story*
from the tiger-skin throne where wa
bade each other, good-by to the holo
caust on -Lynx Island, and back again
to the '. yellow throne where I had, kon -'
estly attempted to tell the* Kinf\a little
of the truth. Now and then "Dulcine
started, frightened; at times she clung
to me in utter fear, and again she
burled her face in her hands. But at
the end she grew wondrously calm.
We , sat then m 'silence, and I knew
she had gone' from the gloomy past to
the: dark future, and so ' I ; outlined
briefly/- the ruse; I had conceived. The
plan was as-fascinating as the "reckless
ness of, its deceit. My words fairly
raised 5 the girl to her feet Trembling,
hand ; and foot, Dulcine , looked; ' at . the'
fire.. at me, and then, like a. guilty per
son,'around the: dimly lighted \ room.
We both looked Into the fire and then
steadily into each other's eyes. I am
sure the same thoughts passed through
our. rninds. Tof night*, (for? it Â¦ was "the
nineteenth,. the booming 7of the great
bell . had sounded the . midnight â¢ hour)
the" King ; would look ,; upon bis; Queen
for the last time, as the 5 sarcophagus
lay : in state on the catafalque in the
throne ; room.' >
"It . is : all too late now , to . prevent < or
postpone.'* I went on impetuously; "for
the sake of the Russian ;â¢ protectorate
about to be announced In the morning;
. I gasped In dismay v/hlle those seri
ous eyes ran over that disordered room,
lingering with awkward, questioning:
glance on each piece of Quelpartienne
finery.
"Has the hospital become - an
asylum?" Oranoff asked quietly. I
laughed and gave some answer which
he can remember better than I. Then
I went to him with the inspiration
which had suddenly come to my dis
tracted brain. I dared not be silent one
moment before this man, and I risked
everything by delivering myself earn
estly of the following Impromptu ex
planation:
"Colonel Oranoff," I said. In & low
voice, "you know our great danger is
an attack by Tuen's men upon the fu
neral procession. I have spent the day
planning to frustrate the attack if
made. My plan is to place a counter
feit body in the sarcophagus and put
the real body in the casket prepared
for the memorial tablets. The army
will surround the sarcophagus, and if
that is harmed the Queen's body will
still be safe."
Even as I spoke I wondered if, after
all. Colonel Oranoff had not gone to
the throne room to prove for himself
the miraculous truth Dulcine had told
him. But 'if he had, he had 4et the
matter pass, and I was sure either he
was deceived or had chosen to let mo
play out the farce to which I had so
desperately resorted at the eleventh
hour.
There are times when the best of men
pass back and forth a black lie know
ingly, and act toward each other as
though it were the truth; might not
this sober man have guessed even
from the first my lying role, and yet
determined to trust me and let me play
it out? Such were my thoughts as I
spoke and as the man looked at me in
tently yet kindly when I had finished.
"That is a good plan, Robert,*" he
said, after a moment's thought; then
he added poignantly, "But you will
need Dulcine in this. I will can her
and remain irr the smoking-room until
you 1 are done." He did not say that he
knew I expected Dulcine; he. did cot
hint that he had seen Dulcine. Yet ha
paved the way easily for our meeting.
There were tears of gratitude In my
aching eyes as he passed me to go out.
and I found his hand in the skirts of
his . coat and wrung it silently. The
pressure he in turn gave me brought
confidence and determination.
Dulcine came in almost as her father
passed out, and stood for a moment In
blank astonishment within that littered
room. Without a word (my throat
suddenly became parched) I placed a
chair before the fire and : drew away
such garments! as lay near it. The
girl did not move. I then went to her
unmindful of the stolid Cossack who
had followed her In, and took her
hand.
Then I saw the was already In tears,
and I quickly found they were hot and
running fast. .
"Robert, dear." she said, un&tr my
trembling caresses, "tell ma what it la.
There is .nothing I would. not do to
help you.""
I drew : her to the chair. Each mo
ment since Dulcine entered my door I
had felt guiltier than ever . before. " , I
had failed everywhere, and I seemed
to be able to do naught but force the
girl Â¦ whom I loved to bear the burden
of my failure. Now, when the moment
came for me to make a clean breast of
it all, my throat seemed paralyzed.
It looked as though I was drying , a
""big week's washing." I locked the
door and sat ; down in the onÂ© empty
chair and lit a cigarette. ;>V>.
"Perad venture these were the silks of
the women of . mine ' own" country." I
soliloquized grimly, "I \ might maks
some progress," and I -gazed about
helplessly enough;. yet I knew that any
good, single ' man of ? sense would have
Ibolted the -whole, thing even then. But
I could not bolt, and the danger.of my
situation came suddenly home to me
as I looked : mechanically at my, watch
and found* the evening was far gone.
How fast the hours were speeding.
Aroused now to my task with fresh
ening. fear, I was seized with the hal
lucination ; that a - subdivision of my
stock would help unravel the mystery,
and 7,'sirode frantically up and down
to select^at first, the smaller garments.
But vhere were they? The silk crea
tion on the bed would have covered a
span of horses, and the gauze scarf or
fish-net or Vhat-not that trailed over
my dresser, some chairs, and a table,
would have hidden two French win
dows. If I found anything of lesser di
mensions, I had no sooner got it under
control than I - discovered It was con
nected by a tail or silk ' isthmus to
some greater affair near by that might
have been an awning over a ship's deck.
Nor was <it easier to get free of these
things than to get hold of them, for
when I had Iain one down and gone
elsewhere - in my search, I found thÂ©
last two * things I had looked at were
still following me about familiarly
enough. The texture of this collection
of Quelpartienne clothing may have
been all I have since heard It was and
all that its cost suggested, but this only
served to bewilder me the more that
night..
-. And so I floundered up and down la
tfcar 5r?Â» of Quelpartienne lingerie which
by znlrlnlsrht was running. high in that
-vr.'io room, when a low knock at my
doer brought a~frightened sigh of relief
to my lips. With one despairing: glance
about me I 'broke over to the door and
threw it open wide. I had mada no
pro^rpss whatever, and the night was
half pper.t; in a doubly serious sense- I
needed Dulcine now.
In walked Colonel Oranoff.
I dreaded to begin my lying role, and
especially with this girl I loved, but I
could see no happier alternative. Her
face was pale, and I could see that
some one had been suffering beside my
self. "The storm has been terrible, and
we were afraid the Dulcette might be
destroyed with all it contained," she
added.
This was a new turn to the black lane
I was traveling, but I gave the same
answer that had formed upbn>my lips.
"We came overland, Dulcine. 0 A
great, happy light broke over the girl's
face, and I saw she believed I had
placed the Queen's body in the new
sarcophagus Colonel Oranoff had pre
pared for It. I ached to tell her the
truth, but I withheld it and let her
bury her face in my hands a moment
for very Joy. ,
When she left the room I got up sick
at heart, and went over to the chair
Dejneff had left, and sent Fak for a
decanter of wine, from which I drank
and drank desperately. I did not know
how weak I was, nor how much liquor
Dejneff had poured into me before.
Then I asked to be taken to the
Kins.
"When I became myself I was in my
own bed, a 6oft hand on my brow; my
boy Pak was standing beside Dulcine,
'and In a chair pulled up before the
fire Dejneff was sprawled out, his face
tilted dejectedly over into his great
beard. Nothing could have brought mo
more Quickly to my senses than that
picture of Dejneff and I closed ray
eyes and went to work on the miser
able problem now confronting me.
I knew and felt at the time that I
should have called Dejneff and Oranoff
to me and made a clean breast of
everything, but as fate would have It I
had conceived a sort of a plan which
to my dazed brain bade fair to save
me from making a confession. I would
go to the King and tell him that Ling
and Ll had perished in the fire, which
consumed the temple of Ching-llng,
and that I. being only an aide, had not
been allowed to take the Queen's body
from Lynx Islandâ the order LI car
ried from the King being lost Â¦with him.
By this ruse the funeral would be post
poned at least until another messenger
was sent to Lynx Island for the corpse;
in the mean time new and better plans
could be made.
So I lay quiet under the stroking of
that kind hand until Dejneff got up
and went unsteadily out of the room.
Then I pretended to return to con-.
sciousness" and attempted to sit up. I
was surprised at my success; evidently
the nourishment given me was of no
weak character.
"Lie down. Robert," Dulcine said
softly: "you-are ill; the doctor is com
ing soon."
"I must not be 111," I blurted out
"Where is Colonel Oranoff?"
"At audience with the King â " Dul
cine hesitated, and then added reluc
tantly, "who has Just sent for you."
"Good," I said with a spirit I did not
possess. "I must go at once"â before the
doctor comes, I thought to myself.
For a moment there was silence;
then, unmindful of the servants, Dul
cine seized my hands:
"Tell me first. Robert dear, have you
brought itâ the Queen's body?"
Such were my thoughts as my pony
stalked unsteadily over the stones of
the pate and Into the vide avenue ly
ing beneath the moon. It was crowded,
os though another spring: rice famine
was on the land and had brought a
dozen Coxey's armies to Keinnlng; yet
this was not a famine crowd, for It
was weil dressed and not very drunk.
The merchants in their booths and the
candy boys with their trays strapped
to their backs were doing a big busi
ness. How they would growl when
this celebration was postponed!
I felt my pony growing weaker, and
at last the poor thing stopped and then
sank slowly upon the ground. Kep
neflTs servant caught me in his arms,
and tried to lift me to his own horse.
I asked him to support me while I at
tempted to walk to th\ legation, the
blaze of its lights making it seem now
but a short distance away. So we went
forward, but as I gazed unsteadily up
on the blur of lights, my strength left
me, poor swimmer that I was. Just as
I neared the river shore! My compan
ion dragged me along to the legation
gate where the Cossack guard came to
his assistance. From there they took
me In the first door, which happened
to be the anteroom of the throne
room where the new sarcophagus
stood awaiting the body that I did not
bring. Here I revived and asked to be
taken to my own room. With my last
bit of strength I closed the lid of the
sarcophagus that no one might know
that I had failed In my errand. Then
I sank on a Cossack's shoulder and let
go of everything.
no task to arrange some hitch. The
soothsayers could be bribed (If there
were any rubles left!) to put the af

THE SAN FRANGISGO; SUNDAY CALL.
3Continued Next Sunday.
Thus I killed an hour In living over
the day to come; then I sot into my
uniform, and calling a boy who could
ppeak English I went out 'into the
night which was/ even now, growing
pale at the thought of day.
I shall hereafter try the reader's pa
tience with the description of Kein
ning on the night of the imperial fu
neral; therefore, I will make shorter
work with the city as I saw it now â
awaiting, with fevered dreams, the
great day now dawning. Tet it is no
less worthy his attention. The city
slept, and yet did not sleep. The
braying of asses tied about the new
palace, where the King's cabinet was
in session, kept that portion of the city
awake; the great bell had aroused all
That was a picture worth remember
ing! A lithe, comely girl in black, her
arms laden with a Quelpartlenne's
filmy white wardrobe, going frankly
and swiftly to that task she had im
petuously struck out for herself. I let
her go willingly, though aching yet that
my failure had brought her this wild
night's work- Mind, I never once
doubted Dulcine Oranoff's ability or
daring; I only regretted that things had
.come to such a wretched pass. I knew
she would find her woman (I made a
shrewd guess as to which servant it
was) and I knew the woman would
surely play the part. But I knew, too,
that Dulcine would be in terror for
forty hours until I had freed the
woman at the Altar of Spices.
Keyed up to the wild business of the
night, I could not sleep, and no sooner
had the orders of the day been Issued
than I sent for mine. For a long time
I studied them and the general procla
mation which was sent with them
touching the pageant of the night." It
wag all as I hoped: Dejneff had or
dered me with the best troops to
guard, through the whole day, the
main entrance of the King's wing, and
to close in about the sarcophagus
when it was brought from the throne
room. Dejneff was In. general com
mand, and rode near the King. Andorph
was at the mausoleum.
One by one Dulcine Oranoff placed
upon her arm the â¢ scattered pieces of
raiment that lay about my room, and
at last 6wept bravely through the cur
tains which the Cossack sentry held
aside for her.
AN EARLY MORNING'S TASK
CHAPTER XV,
As I struggled en through the thor
oughfares, these papers were now get
ting into general circulation. Many
who coijld not read were gathered at
the corners of the streets, where men of
commanding stature and voice read the
proclamation ajoud. Here and there
single white-robed citizens were read
ing it apart by themselves. Some,
whose angry faces showed plainly their
bitterness,' were crushing the white
pages and growling aloud.
But it was a nation's holiday, and the
Russian ruse ' held good! Holiday
clothes, an abundance of regalia and
drink, and a national conscience
drugged to Indifference by centuries of
oppressionâ all these had their influ
ence, and the patriotic orators shouted
in vain. They were as â¢ powerless as
rats in a doomed ship which they can
ho more leaveâ though running speed
ily toward a. maelstrom of "Russian des
potism.
jj Behind the scenes all. had been work
ing well.. If friction showed anywhere
the' "parts"* were quickly lubricated
Â¦with; gold rubles andâ well, "the King
of Quelparte was shaved.
But this funeral, which was the sav
ing of the Russian plot, was now the
wrecking of Tuen's. It made little dif
ference whether Russia, had (Quelparte
if the -world ' did : hot . know "of j it, : for
how,, then could it.be thrown over, when
Port Arthur was taken ? .'And it made
little 'difference > to the Chinese prince
â¢whether the ; body of . the . murdered
Queen was whole or in a thousand
But the beginning of the pageant, the
crowds of people, the holiday skillfully
prepared, came none too soon! The
Government Gazette, published at
noon, announced the agreement reached
between the King of Quelparte and the
Czar of Russia. It was diplomatically
stated that, for reasons best under
stood by the people of Quelparte, Rus
sia, out of the kindness of- her. great
heart, had assumed.'for the moment, at
the request of the King of Quelparte
and his cabinet, the management of the
financial, commercial andrnilltary de
partments of the kingdom. This was
done from two humanitarian motives:
to take some of the burden from the
King's shoulders, and to bring Quel
parte into such a relation to Russia
that she might share her civil and com
mercial advantages.
A QUEEN INCOGNITO.
CHAPTER XVII
"That is all. Captain." HÂ© saluted,
and I strode on across the- plaza to
ward the King's wing.
' There I ran .upon Dejneff, Issuing the
orders of the night to the cavalry offi
cers flaring in their gTeat red silk
sleeves. .
I called him, and he stepped back Into
the gloom with me.
"We must change this route, Dej
neff," and I pointed to the orders.
"Why?" broke out the old soldier,
holding his breath.
"Because this parading up and down
in the Chinese. quarters is nothing but
senseless bravado. Look you," and I
pointed toward the . west gate, "tha
whole quarter is In darkness. Even the
boys' are pelting the silk lanterns with
stones. And . the commonest coolie
knows Prince Tuen would rather miss
the tribute from a dozen Quelpartes
than have that tablet dropped over the
Queen's corpse. If, as the , Kin? has
said, he 'has pawed Quelparte over for
her,', do you think he . â¢will let us carry
her body safely through a thirty-foot
street in a Chinese city at midnight un
opposed?"
I quickly made up my mind to go to
the King and demand a change of the
route, but I paced up and down in the
hollow square formed by my com
panies considering a worthy excuse. I
did not wish to frighten His Majesty,
yet, if it lay In my power, the route
of the procession should be altered. I
also needed to have an alternate
course on my tongue's end; on this lat
ter point I needed help and sent for
Lieutenant Kim.
When he came I pulled him Into the
dark. }
"The route of march is out the West,
Gate?" I asked.
"So the orders read," answered the
youth.
"Is there no better "way, Kim?"
He looked at me In surprise.
"Why better?"
"Wellâ safer, then!" for I felt I
could trust this serious lad.
"Oho! so you are troubled too," he
said, thoughtfully: "there will be few
sorry when this business is over."
"Answer me," I ordered; then I added
encouragingly, "I do not like that Chi
nese quarter, Kim."
"Nor I!" he put In quickly; 'it's
dark as night."
. "You mean â "
/ "I mean there are no lights burning
in it; even our lanterns in the silken
nets which line the imperial route
have been, put , out by boys who are
throwing stones Into them."
All this chilled me.
"But can we go another way?"
"Yes," answered Kim, thoughtfully,
"through the little West Gate."
"A roundabout course?"
"Very."
"But a possible one?"
"I think so. 1 *
"And we could evade that quarter?"
"Entirelyâ but â " and Kim looked
away across the dimly lighted city.
"But what?" I asked sternly. "Tell
me anything you know, Kim. I dread
going into the Chinese quarter; if .we
do, I am sure there will be the devil to
pay."
' "The orders" are out, and I do not
think they can be revoked." .
"Is that all?"
THE TRAIL OF EARTH.
CHAPTER XVIII.
Now, if I had thought Whang-Su
would look thus upon the matter, I
should certainly have told h'lm the
whole truth before undertaking the stu
pendous deception now on hand. But
it was too late.- I could have confessed
failure and Tuen's success, but I
would not confess to this deceit. It
would lay bare the whole string of my
lies for ope thing, and, after all, the
King might fear the myth more than
he had confessed. At any rate, we
should have to deceive every one else,
and he was only one. So I held' my
peace.
But the King was t still serious and
/worried, as could be seen with half an
eye. Again I Jumped to a conclusion:
''You fear Tuen yet?" I suggested.
He blew a cloud of smoke, looked at
me gravely through It, and nodded.
"I shall fear him until she"â blowing
a straight column of smoke toward the
Earcopbagus- : -"is In the tomb, and the
great tablet has fallen upon her.','
."Faugh!". I exclaimed, '.'trust that to
us, Sire, . your best"' troops will sur
round the bler^ at all times. It is safer
than ever it was at Lynx Island." r
The King looked long into my face,
and I thought I could see a pathetic
thing there â the questioning look of
one to whom the real truth is never
told. But I lied on right and left, and
the King believed all I said. And his
face grew more serious still. I thought
perhaps I could venture a probe or
two, and so I too went straight to cen
ter by saying:
"You were fearing Prince Tuen;
Colonel Li told me."
He started and put his finger to his
lips. But then he laughed i and whis
pered:
"Yes; the old boar has been trying to
find , her," and he Jerked his thumb
toward the golden casket. "But we
fooled him," added the King, with his
only English oath and a chuckle.
Here was my chance.
"And would your Majesty fear the
myth if he had destroyed the Queen's
body?"
" 'To hell with the myth,' as Oranoff
saysâ fto; but the people would;. oh, the
people!" and the King held up his
hands with an expression of pity I can
not describe. . â¢
"You had no trouble?" he then
asked' swiftly. -
"No,* Sire," I answered.
I wondered if the King of Quelparte
was over serious. "I was taking / a
turn before bedtime," he went on, after
laughing covertly at his own Jest, "and
heard you were here. I want to thank
you for ably completing Colonel Li's
mission."
He was looking at the sarcophagus
now. and my hand curled tightly over
the blade it obscured from view. ,
"But permit me to warn as well as
thank. The' announcementâ"
He paused again until I nodded sig
nificantly. ' â¢
'"Yes, this announcement. It .may
make trouble. You should be on your
guard? Certain 'â¢so-called patriots,' im
bibing your Eastern ideas,, pose as
statesmen and breathe revolutionary
sentiments. Usually they only breathe
âsometimes moTe. But, more or less,
be on your guard."
I bowed. For a moment there -, was
utter silence in the room . save for the
pounding of my heart. What if the
King should come to the sarcophagus?
I determined to block his way even at
the risk of my life. I would say my
orders were to let no one look upon the
body, and that I should obey the order
literally at any cost. Our game] had
cost too much to be broken up now.
Arid the woman, maybe, had heard the
conversation. I feared for her if she
thought the King's'own eyes were rest
ing on her.
But instead of coming nearer, the
King moved backward to the. wall and
beckoned me to his side.
For the first time in his life, for all I
knew, Whang-Su's face was serious.
He had produced his' cigarette box and
offered one to' me and lighted his own
from the plebeian match. ,
It was not until after two or three
nervous puffs and a spasmodic inhala
tion .that his Majesty spoke. . \
What may have seen to '. Whang-Su
abject obeisance was little less than a
swoon/for, though I sank to my knees,
the action was wholly due to the weak
condition of my nerves, Suddenly un
strung at the sight of his Majesty.
It was a moment before ' the King
spoke, but a moment long enough for
me to determine to hold fast to the
hand we were playing until I knew it
had been exposed. I rose with clinched
teeth . and hands, even saluting with a
closed flat. I placed one hand irrever
ently^on the sarcophagus, and I had a
dagger In It. If our woman played her
part poorly, through "fright or hys
teria, I was determined that her gen
uine corpse should grace the occasion!
The King's first word, spoken in that
Jaunty, leering tone, with which I was
familiar, dispelled my fears, and I
breathed a prayer of thanksgiving.. Â¦
"I slipped in. Captain Martyn, while
the room was cleared^ I *like cleared
rooms."
THE KING
CHAPTER XVI.
At last I took her arms from my
neck, for 'she clung to me tenderly â as
though she were praying. Thank God
for the tenderness of that farewell! Â¦
"At five o'clock the body will be ly
ing at the end of the hall leading to
the antechamber of the throne room,
behind the curtains of the alcove. You
will place it where it belongs."
I offered Dulcine the chair again, and
she took it. and we sat many minutes
in silence, thinking.
Ar.on we spoke of dangerous possi
bilities and discussed them rapidly in
low tones. I asked Dulcine once more
of her purpose, and again she gently
t hided my lack of faith in her. and I
said no more. I then told her that my
own command would guard the bier
on the long Journey to the mausoleum.
More than once the possibility of her
being betrayed occurred to me, and I
could not help saying:
"If your woman plays us false?"
And I spoke slowly, for I hoped the
girl would interrupt me.
"Kill her where she lies!" Dulcine
whispered, trembling. Evidently the
thought of my taking the woman's life
overcame the girl, for 8he hid her face
Â«>n my shoulder. Then she admitted it
wns possible that under the terrible
strain an involuntary movement might
be detected and prove disastrous. But
when she arose presently, there was no
signs of tears in her dark, steadfast
eyes. I kissed her good-night; but then
she did not go. All our happiness,
even our very lives, it seemed, hung
in a trembling balance. Dulcine was
to Join a house-party at the British
Legation in the morning, and attend
the funeral with the legation ladies. I
knew 1 might never see her again, for
accidents happen in desperate games.
"When we meet again â " I said. But
I could not complete what I had begun.
A great gulf seemed to yawn between
us already.
"We will never part, Robert"
"M the Altar of Spices." I answered,
after a moment's thought. "At three
taps cf my scabbard on the sarcopha
sus let her raise the lid within, and I
will slide the cover. Until then let her
move not."
The girl steadied her eyes into the
fireplace and then answered slowly,
"You can do that for me, Robert, and
better than L"
Then I paused to think. Dulcine
found questions to ask In her turn.
"And where would the woman be
freed?"
"You can have the antechamber
cleared and place her in the sarcopha
gus?"
for the sake of Colonel Oranoff. whose
reputation la at stake, for the sake of
my oÂ»wn name and honor, the imperial
funeral must ko on over a counterfeit
body!"
I sat down In a chair, my head In my
hands. Dulcine stood quiet by herself a
moment- Finally she whispered:
"Robert, you are. right. It must all
go on without a quibble. You have
done your full duty, now let me do
mine. I know a wtrman who will play
this 'part for us."
This took me utterly by surprise.
And yet the slrl was right. After
those hours of struggling It was plain
that my dummy queen would be too
unreal. Dulcine misunderstood my si
lence.
"You can trust me, Rooert?"
It was not lack of trust, God knew,
that made me hesitate.
"You can embalm the body?"
"Apparently."
"You know a woman you can trust?"
â¢I do."
"Who would dare tu Cie, if necessary.
Thus he approached slowly into the
dark cave en the right. Here he found
the stone sides were not smooth, as he
feared they might be, but rough and
as easy to mount as the sides of the
image without. And when he stopped
a moment to rest, he looked upward
and thought he saw a dim light, as
though there actually existed an open
ing to the top of the head! This awoke
all his tired muscles and on he scram
bled up through toward the light. Then
suddenly a terrific wind burst through
the gorge, carrying poor Song Do with
it. His climbing in the nose had made
the great stone god' sneeze!
But when the bruised lad came to
consciousness, he found that the giant's
Bneeze had loosened the pear which lay
In the road beside him; and the Quel
partiens still say, "It's a bad wind that
blows not good for some one."
We had Journeyed to the Great Bell
and were now back at the barracks,
and, as I went forward to get the son
of old Ling to help me, I thought of
our own' adage so like the Quelpar
tlens'; but of all the ill winds of which
I knew, what wind blew good for me?
Once in* the officers' quarters, I or
dered out my troops and sent for Kim
Ling. A strong, sober youth of per
haps eight and twenty answered my
summons. I was pleased even the mo
ment I looked upon him. The quiet
grave face assured me that the father
had not misjudged the son. I told the
lad of his father's prayer to me, and of
my words to the King. The youth
drew from hla breast an appointment
he had Just received. It was that of
Secret Chief Guardian of .the Queen.
He had been Informed of his father's
death and that he was raised to his
father's position. Just what that posi
tion wag he had not, as yet, been in
formed, though he was to begin duty
the day of the funeralâ to-morrow.
Meantime he was under my control and
â as I admired his stolid presence and
It was like climbing the steepest hill
side in his native mountains, and the

Ing through all the years of his boy
hood were now put to their, stiffest
task. Large clusters of bushes were
growing wherever there had been
earth enough to catch and nourish
wind-strewn seeds. Those nearest the
path were worn by the hands of thou
sands of aspirants as high in hope and
as excited by glowing dreams as Song
Do. Then he stopped to rest and look
down; the Image had now lost its ac
customed figure, and from his high
perch the boy could identify no feature
save only the two great caverns cf the
nose above him. On these he kept his
eyes, and, when the great path turned
away from them, he left it and began
to pick out a new and dangerous
course.
As Song Do (for such was the lad's
name), sat- looking upward, thinking
of the high position in the government
the first possessor of the pear was
prophesied to reach his eyes rested
with fascinating intentness upon the
great black gorges of the Idol's noser
Had no one sought a passageway to
the head through th)>se great caverns?
The Idea was soon burning Song Do's
brain, and. eating the dried fruit he
carried, and otherwise lightening him
self by throwing off his flowing white
cloak, he was soon threading with fe
verish haste the worn path which led
to the steep ascent up the idol's side.
When a mere lad the Governor of
Chal-dong determined to leave his
home in the little mountain village
where hl3 parents lived, and go to the
capital and take the examinations for
a government position.
The boy studied as he journeyed,
scarcely locking about him until he
reached the Great Buddhaâ an im
mense stone image of great height.
Upon the idol's head, which towered
Into the skies, he saw the famous pear
tree, and the one fine pear upon it
which the youth of his land had vainly
striven to secure for years and genera
tions. V
As. the boy scanned the ragged stone
ride of the idol's jaws and cheeks, and
the precipice of the straight forehead
(at the base of which hundreds had
been killed), he wondered that no one
had endeavored to find another course
to the top of the head. The path
around the ear to the base, of the pre
cipice of the forehead was deeply worn
âbut that precipice had never been
scaled.

where the devil could not "sting him

even . as my fine charger broke oh
through j the j great tides of white-robed

.anxieties more easily, but I could not.
If I could have reached one single clear
conclusion '; concerning the next move
of: Tuen's people, I might have pre
pared to thwart them; but I could not.
It all resolved itself now.tq a fight for
Dulcme's life with an -enemy whose
power and tactics could not be guessed.
' And the King's fears now Increased
my own an hundredfold!
; When I galloped up to the plaza be
fore the legation, I heard the steady
tramp of my columns, hastened by
Kim from' the barracks. I knew my
, control over, them. "While the ammu-.
nition dealt to others might be blank
cartridges, my men | carried heavier
â¢shells. The men knew it and respected
themselves and me the more. And we
were to surround the bier on the march
to' the tombj
We are apt to go to extremes In times
of trying suspense. As I rode forward
' v at the head of these hundreds of well
armed men- who respected me, I tried
to laugh at my fears.
We drew- up in a hollow square on
the plaza before the King's wing. With
in, the antechamber and the throne
room .were* seething masses of ser
vants, royal eunuchs, military officers,
palace officials and aides â all hurrying
to and fro silently, but, to the-eye, in
utter confusion. Far up the room, be
fore the throne, stood ' the elaborate
catafalque banked with lotus leaves
and chrysanthemums. Upon it lay the
magnificent 'sarcophagus glittering and
resplendent ! In the swinging lights.
Around* it Â¦ moved three stalwart Â¦ eu
nuchs In gorgeous apparel. To it my
eyes ran, arid on it they rested long.
It seemed as If I had not begun to
realize Dulclne'a situation before. As
I looked over the heads of the con
'course of people upon her glittering cell
I/ groaned In anguish. For twelve
hours she had lain as one dead, without
a crumb of food or a drop of water to"
moisten the parched lips. But' the
physical strain was nothing, perhaps,
to the mental. With eyes bound over
with flaxen bands she could not know
whether she was plain in view or com
pletely screened from the gaze of the
people.
~ Was "aT" woman ever so placed? A
sneeze or 'cough might cost her a
father's and a lover's life too. And yet
I could have trusted no one else there
as, I could the dauntless, stern Dul
cine. While the perspiration streamed
from my face I sank on a chair, my
head In my shaking hands, and prayed
God to guide and guard.
A roll i of drums brought me to my
feet. The King was coming! Impul
sively I began to press- forward to be
as hear' Dulcine as possible until my
troops could surround her. Of the cere
mony now begun I knew, absolutely
nothing more than Dulcine herself had
told meâ that the King was to close
the lid of the sarcophagus. I won
dered anxiously if the girl was right.
Would his Majesty attempt to identify
the remains? This I doubted since they
were embalmed.* No, that fear was
groundless. . BuP fear of Tuen hung
over me like the sword of Damocles. I
felt It might fall any moment at the
raisins of a finger. ,
My very audacity ' In approaching
near the sarcophagus was the best cre
dential I could have had, and Dejneff s
uniform now stood me in good stead,
and I advanced unchallenged until I
could survey the golden, flower
strewn casket.
It seemed strange that I had only
given it a passing notice before. But
how â¢ different it seemed, now that I.
knew what a precious charge It con
tained. It was a very long, deep case,
beautifully ornamented with gold and
mother-of-pearl Inlaid. It measured,
as I ran my eye over it, perhaps nine
feet . in ; length by four ; in depth, and
was ; three feet wide ; the great orna
mented cover which the King was to
draw on was hollow, and was at least
two feet in height. Dulcine could even
stand' up in her golden prison-house.
The cover' locked itself automatically
when once. shot 7 Into, placeâ this much
I<had ascertained when Kim placed
Dulcine in Â¦ It . . that "A morningâ and it
could only, be opened from within. Thus
when the King drew the cover on, he
locked ; the Queen's remains In their'
eternal cell, making them proof against
all, but violence. This was the signifi
cance of the present ceremony and di
rectly pointed to the popular fear of
that terrible legend of Quelparte-
Pressing istlll nearer, I could at ; last
see within the flower-strewn . casket.
Far beneath a long glass cover, which
lifted on golden hinges, a form in
musty gray cerements lay/ still and.
calm. 4 So loose was the upper robe that
the^ motion ; of ; breathing . co'uid not be
detected. The face, bound closely In
flaxen bands, seemed calm as In
death.' As I looked, the matchless
bravery of the girl overcame me, and
fora moment I delighted In the daring
of the farce.
Amid another roll of drums the pro
cession entered the throne room, thj
King sauntering: behind his head eu
nuchs, and beside him walked the
Crown Prince.- I stepped down quickly
from my position of vantage on the
steps ascending to the throne, by
me. as I knelt passed the royal party,
the King taking his seat upon the
throne." Finally, after an age of heath
en mummery, Whang-Su descended the
, broad steps to the catafalque, dropped
thejglass lid ;and drew on the golden
cover â gracefully, jauntily." as his .
Majesty did all else. .The girl lay as
dead before him, but I felt sure that
when the heavy cover shot into. place
her nerves gave way from the terrible
strain. I was glad the great cover was
hollow, allowing the prisoner air, for
she could raise the glass lid herself and
sit upright within her magnificent ceU-
My heart, too, was in the Queen's
sarcophagus, smothered by the dense
fragrance of flowers and spice.
As the King passed out, the Imperial
watch, dressed in the brilliant uni
forms of Quelpartlen armjr officers,
took its stand around the sarcophagus;
but I saw at once that they were gen
darmes In disguise. Dejneff was with
them, and I spoke to him as he handed
me my orders for the night. "
"Those men are armed?" I asked In
French.
"To the teeth."
"With powder and ball?"
"Powder, ball, rapier and dagger,**
said the man, swiftly, and I saw he,
too, sensed trouble In the wind. And
he looked at me significantly.
I did not realize that I looked like a
ghost, and so I read into his searching
glance more, than he ever meant. But
to talk a moment with another did me
a world of good.
"You look for trouble?"
"You look as If you had already j
seen it," he replied evasively. -
"How do we get to the tomb?" i (
'/Through the "West Gate; the King's \
Trail of Earth is laid that way."
"My God, Dejneff, not through the
Chinese quarter," I gasped.
The Russian shrugged his shoulders
and tapped his orders significantly and
then moved away.
With a groan I gave one longing
glance at the, golden sarcophagus and
rushed out Into the open air.

OVER A HONEYSUCKLE
"What, Sarah Pendergast, the old
maid? Why, she's been trying her
very best for the last fifteen years to
catch a man, and she'd give all her old
shoes even to say yes to a widower
eighty years old." 4 _
Indeed, it was no one's fault.. It
was simply one of those things that
occur now and then in every commu
nity. A girl gets left out for no par
ticular reason, and the first thing she
knows she's being called aunt, and
looked up to with respect due to old
age. Sarah had a brother William for
whom she kept house. William was
an old bachelor and inclined to silence,
but now and then he had a way of
making the sister feel .that her mission
had been left unaccomplished. On
the night of her thirty-third birthday
the spirit moved him to say:
"Sarah, I've lived a single life for
forty years, and I . don't- Intend to
change it, but if I were you, I'd get
a husband if I had to chase him from,
here to Bebee's Corners."
. "I could have married ten times
over If I had wented to leave you."
she replied.
"Well, don't let me stand in the way
any longer. - I ain't blaming you Â¦ al
together, but folks are giggling and
poking, fun at you all over the county.
.Why don't you get out and hustle lik-_Â»
other girls?" '"
Sara Â¦ defended ; her position with
spirit, but that night after I she got to
bed she lay awake for two hours and
then came to a decision. For the first
time since she was. old; enough to
marry she made up her mind to go on
a man-hunt and show brother, William
and the rest of Temple County that
she could get married as well as other
folks. One thing that helped her to
reach this decision Just at the time
was the fact that , young Enos John
son, son of Fanner Johnson,- had. been
paying her attention. That is, he had
The innocent Enos didn't* know what
was in store for him, and, therefore,
came over the next evening to tell how
the old spotted cow 'had a sore, back
and one of the hogs had a swelling on
its Jaw. If he hadn't been so busy eat
ing, Spitzenberg, apples and ." cracking
black Â¦ walnuts Â¦ he - might have noticed
that Sarah was more affectionate than
usual, and that brother William 'went
oft - to bed; half an hour ahead of his
usual '.time. â¢â¢Â¦â¢But Enos 'had , no ' guile
and â¢ didn't " expect It in others. Before
he left for home 4 he had agreed to go
sliding' on the pond with Sarah the
next evening, and that night^she lay
awake again to do a little more plan
ning. T Next morning as soon as the '
bachelor brother had : taken' his de
parture ; for the woods, 'she hunted up,
an old s. ax i and waded through 1 the
snow; toafuond'in the old wheatfleld
to' cut a good-sized hole In the Ice.' Had
the | pond -been', on a. gentleman's farm
it would' have ;been called ,*a' lake; had
it j been nearer, the barnyard E it ' would
have been referred to as a horse pond,
called at | the; house now: and: then .of
an ! e venlrig; to eat : apples an d pop-corn
in* her company, and to talk - weather
and crops with her ; farmer brother.

â¢""Y ARAH Pendergast was not to
V^X blame that she had lived to the
X_J a se of thirty-three without being
4â¢^ married. When she looked back
over the long road she couldn't' see
where it was her fault, and as for oth
er people, they said:
â¢'And I've fell in love with Sarah!"
"It can't be!"
"Enos, .darling,. kiss me!" came from
the soppy bundle on the. floor. . â¢ ;
."Durned If I don't, and right off now,

When evening came again behold
brother William nursing a sore heel
-before the kitchen fire, and Sarah and
Enos cantering about the pond like two
children given a holiday. The No. 10
boots worn by Enos soon made a slid

slide and be set on her feet again by his
strong arms. Gradually, as she grew
more coy. and artless, and as Enos gal
loped about with more vigor and began
to wonder if he wasn't a good deal of a
feller after all, she so managed things
as to approach nearer and nearer the
hole cut in the Ice that morning. By
and by she got a warning, and later on
another, but she smiled and said she
had a hero at hand to save her. Then
came the climax of her planning. There
was a quick run down hill, a long slide
and a fall and a scream, and into the
hole she went. It was no matter that
her feet could touch the cold mud and
make the bullheads wonder what was
going on, or that she could have pulled
herself . out as fast as she got in had
she so minded. She had a part to play,
and she played it. At her first scream
Enos started for the house yelling "po
lice!" at the top of his voice. At her
second he turned back and grabbed a
fence rail and shoved it at her so vigor
ously that he came near breaking her
ribs with the end of it. It was not until
scream the fifth had risen on the nhrht.
air to make the stars turn pale and
shudder that Enos flung down his hat.
yanked off his overcoat and blue yarn
mittens and showed himself the hero
that he was. - <
After trying to push Sarah a foot
farther down into the mud and water
he suddenly realized that the right
way was to pull instead of push, and
with a heave and a grunt he flopped
her out on the ice. He had heard
that half-drowned people ought to be
rolled on a barrel. There was no bar
rel handy, and so he rolled Sarah over
and over in the snow. When he be
lieved that he had recalled the flame
of life he picked her up like a bag of
potatoes and flung her over his shoul
der < and smarted for the house, and
there was no mistaking his feelings
when he said:
"If Sarah dies of this I hope our
old muley cow will kick my head off."
In wading through the snowdrifts
and climbing rail fences Sarah was
dropped three or four times," and ' each
time she faintly protested that she was
able to walk, but the hero had been
roused to action, and nothing could
stop him. Up went- Sarah again, her
shoes leaking, mud and water and her
wet arms clinging around Enos' neck
and shoulders, and at last he arrived
at the kitchen door and kicked It open
and laid his burden on the floor. .
"Gee-whiz, but what is it?" gasped
brother William, as he got his sore
heel under his chair and faced about.

Howbridge tried to get down to work
on his story, which was to be of no
great length, and which ordinarily he
could have written in a few days, but
he made -no headway. He could not
suit himself; he made a Jumble of it.
and each morning's 1 installment was
written in a different mood. At last
he destroyed it and began over again,
wondering what was the matter with
him. 9i}.'il
He soon found out. Meanwhile, he
found himself at an inexplicable stand
still In his acquaintance with Joanna,
who seemed to avoid him. One day
he entered the studio while she was
posing, and her eyes met his with a
question new to him. The same day
she , broke off in the midst of a song
to ask:
"To compose a heart-breaking thing
like that did he have' to have had the
experience himself?"
"Not necessarily. If he had suffi
cient artistic imagination he would
get a better perspective of the suffer
ings of another."
She struck up a gay melody, but her
face was thoughtful. Then her mood
changed, and he could not keep up
with her brilliant sallies. She teased
and dared him, half bewildered /ind
wholly charmed him. He decided that
she could flirt most gloriously, and
was ready for her, but by evening she
was again unapproachable.
The next morning he was called to
the studio, where he found Joanna
posing listlessly. Phil was irritated
and critical. ;
sonaliy, as ne nad studied all girls since
his betrothed married another man
while Howbridge was at college dream
ing and writing her sentimental love
letters. â¢ -The other man had always
wasted her, so he stayed on" the spot,
saw her every day, and djd things until
he got hsrâ which taught Howbrtdga a
lesson. He woke up, and after that his
characters . were more real â not like
those In his first book.
Joanna had no : heart history. Men
who saw much of her did. They v al
ways to her surprise, fell in love with
her, and to their own surprise, married
other women, and sighingly remem
bered her as a lost love when they had
Indigestion, or lost out in some project.
Joanna liked men in a comradely way,
and never flirted, for she was very sin
cere, and hated to hurt any thing. Be
sides, she wanted to keep her heart all
in one piece.
She and Oliver walked and drove
and canoed together, and talked much
about nothing in particular, and said
a lot that they did not mean, which
was a sure method of learning each
other's, tastes. She ridiculed his com
monplace title, and began posing to
Phil for the illustrations.
But he knew it was. He walked to
her side and drew her into his arms,
with his face against her hair and her
tmr<<*Â« in h+T, i He quivered, knowing
his touch meant nothing to herâ thai
she vu only 1 posing.
When it wa^over he thought It out
in his room. And nearly all night he
wrote â bis own story â and Joanna'sâ
Just as it' wasâ how he had met and
come to love her. He put into It his
heart and soul, going beyond fact only
in making her finally yield to his plea
for her love. It was morning when he
finished.
After breakfast he told Phil to let
the pictures go for awhile, got thÂ»
sketches of Joanna, locked them up.
and .went to touching up his work of
the night preceding. Surely It would
move herâ it would tell her better than
spoken wcrrds.
After luncheon he slipped the manu
script under her door, and waited. He
heard her enter her room. He walked
the floor, but all afternoon she made no
sign.
At dinner her head was high, her
cheeks pink and her eyes very bright,
and later she asked Howbridge to go
up the river. They walked silently
to the canoe. Johanna took the paddle,
and bade Howbridge not to talk. He
did not wish to. It was enough to loolc
at her and wait till she let him ask hex
about their story. As they glided near
the shore In blurring tree shadows, aha
spoke,
"That !Â¦ a good story. I congratu
late you on your success." Could she
be Joking? "The plot is clever, tha
characters are true to life and ft is
full of feeling." Her tons was cutting.
"Joanna! Don't you understand?
Don't â ~.":\-
"I understand perfectly. You came
for material, and you got it. Phil say*
you are going to see your publish
ers to-morrow. Well, you needn't re
turn. I despise you. You not only
made me care, but you dared show me
to what, advantage you use my love.
I shall get over it." .
"Joanna!" Her eyes blazed.
"And vou dared to touch me when
my brother's presence made me power
less to resent it, and you knew what
it meant to me? Oliver Howbridge,
you â " but he stopped her.
"It's my turn. now. I love you. The
story was written for you alone; no
one else will see it. It Is the story of
my heart, dear. I thought you would
understand. It was my way of telling
you that life is made up of wanting
you. Don't you see? â¢ Can't you love
mei Jo?"
Her anger died away. Tears stood
In her eyes, but her laugh was saucy,
provoking.
"Yes, Oliver, but not enough to die
with you Just yet."
"Die?"
"Yes, we will, if you don't stay where
you are and stop- tipping' the canoe.**
She was her old teasing self. It was
shamefully late before she. would land,
and let her lover take her Into bis arms
and Into his heart for all time. tf/
"You can't know Â¦women very well.
do you? You're tooâ" she paused
roguishly.
"Too young?" he hazarded.
"I don't know how old you feeL
But it's not a^e that elves insight. Is
It? By the way. Mr. Howbridge,
where do you get your material? For
your new story, for Instance,, that's
announced for September? The title
â isn't !t 'weak? And how do you know
"What Life Is Made Of?' '*
"Suppose I came down here Just
to find out?" he said mysteriously.
"Perhaps you can show me? They
cay that -women know. The story Is
hardly begun. Can't you find me a
model for a heroine? It would be a
charity to the reading public" Joanna
rr.'jsed.
. "There aren't ten Interesting women
in this neighborhood, not even count
ir.K my sister-in-law â "
"And you."
"Thank you, since I couldn't say It
myself." Their conversation was cut
short by the entrance of Phil and his
wife, who liked her husband's friends,
and had invited Howbridgre to spend
his six weeks' vacation and write his
story at "The Place Apart," as they
called their summer home, which was
near. Phil was an illustrator, and be
tween him and Mrs. Phil, who had been
an interior decorator, the co-ttage was
a thing to dream about artistically.
They had a keen sense of what not to
put lr.to a house. Joanna, who was
practical, lived with them, did the
housekeeping, which she loved, posed
for her brother and roamed the woods
with her big St. Bernard dog.
Howbridge was given a room, abso
lute disposal cf his time and potluck
In a family that had all the charms
and rone of the discomforts of camp-
Ing. Joanna treated him like an amus
ing playmate, teased him about his lit
erary abstractions and his writing and
pretended to search for a model for
bis heroine. Ehe knew little of books,
but could caricature effectively, sing
like a thrush and play the piano with
znuslcianly Instinct. She was 22. and
had always lived. He was 33, and had
always writtenâ with moderate suc
cess.
HowtorldgÂ» studied Joanna lrnper-
"Follow your conscience. Miss Tren
ton. Hut did Phil make you read It? I
wouldn't mir.d knowing whether you
cried at the ri^ht places. Did you?"
He leaned toward her. His strong face
â¢was clean shaven; his gray eyes were
non-committal; he had the sad mouth
and pestle manners of a humorist.
"Oh, I didn't read it." she said.
"Why not?"
"Because I did read your first book.
I don't like your women. I'd like to be
pclite, but you mentioned my con
science."
"Don't nilnd my feelings, and tell me
what is wrong with the women in my
tales."
"They are all right. It's you. You
make them do what they never would
do of their own free wilL Now, you
married Fanny to that Burson; he
wasn't even interesting." He waited
for her to continue, his fertile fancy
fitting literary situations about her
personality.
"He's ell right, Jo," Phil said. ~and
I hope you won't break his heart badly
enough to keep him from finishing the
story I'm to Uliffitrate â if rouTl pose
for me."
Jocnra's b!tse eyes danced â then, and
a little later when Phil made an insuf
ficient excuse, and left them alone.
Howbridjre felt as If he had been told
to play with a strange little girL Joan
na Â¦was Quite at ease. The mischievous
freedom of her slance contradicted the
reserve of her bearing. Howbridge de
cided that she was fit to be the heroine

By A. M. Bavies Og'des*
Still in silence the girl bent across
the odorous hedge and slipped the
flower . into his coat. Suddenly his
hand closed over the fingers on his
breast, holding them so that she could
feel the pounding of his heart. For
a long moment the girl looked deep
Into his eyes.
"The game has been very pleasant,"
she said slowly. "But now the end
has come and ..to-night I am to say
good-by." Â¦ mm . ' *
Maxwell started. "Good-by," he
echoed stupidly. "Now, after you have
come to me. . Good-by! It has not
been all a game," he went on, gather-
Ing courage. The girl put up a pro
testing hand..
< "No, no, we were pretending. Re
member." . . v
Â¦ "There was no pretense on my
side," Maxwell's voice was steady. "I
love you." -Â¦ . V.v 'â¢
"But you can't, you mustn't. You're
not playing . fair. Besides, you don't
even know. my name," urged the girl
in dismay. Maxwell laughed. .
"Not know you ? I Â¦ tiave always
known you and waited for you," he as
serted. The girl, who â¢ had glanced up
quickly, shook her head.
"You are mistaken," she murmured.
"Iâ I thought' ourselves just, pretend
ing, I thought you knew the rules of
the game, : forgive ' me, butâ I am Â¦ al
ready engaged."
"What ! " .;-; the exclamation . broke
sharply from MaxwelL" I, When he went
on It was in ; an â¢ altered voice. . t . , .
; "I â¢ seel It * has been ' m'r own Â¦ fault.

now."
"But," Interposed Maxwell again,
"can't you see it's only because I want
to meet you again somewhere, any
where," recklessly. "What do I care
for Mrs. Cory. You will come back
here," he implored. The girl smiled.
"You will promise to stay on your
own side of the hedge?" >.}
"If I must," obediently. "But â am I
never to cross it?" Her face changed.
"Before I leave I will myself break
the spell, and then perhapsâ" she
hesitated. "But until then, no."
"You are going," In alarm. She
laughed again, wjÂ£<
"Surely you cannot expect me to re
main forever."
"I could remain here â forever," he
answered. * . .
"On the other side- of the fence,"
with tilted chin. , â \
â¢ "On the other side," emphatically.
"Would I were there now." >
"Already wishing for my depar
ture," murmured the girl In exagger
ated reproach. "Good-by, then, this
time really good-by."
"But you will come back," eagerly.
She paused and glanced back over her
shoulder. Â¦
"Perhaps,"- she answered.
The slow, sweet summer days drift
ed lazily by and with them Maxwell,
half . consciously, but none > the. less
steadily, felt his peace of mind slip
ping Â¦ likewise n ' .
And then at last, when all r the world
lay white and dreamy beneath, the
moonshine, she. came, stepping dain
tily across the dewy grass. At sight
of her Maxwell drew a long breath:
"Ah, moon of my delight, that
knows no" wane." r he breathed. The
girl's gaze wandered past him to
where the waves, danced 'in shimmer
ing rippies under the \ soft radiance,'
and for a" space the spell of the. night
laid .its hush upon them.. 'Maxwell
leaned toward the barrier. 1
"Do you smell the . honeysuckle ?*â¢
he murmured.' The girl shivered.
"It Is almost " too sweet," she an
swered low. t "Too intense."
"Then cireme the spray yon wear."
"What do you know of me?"
"Who has not heard of the great ten
nis champion?" she laughed, half-mock
ingly. "Here Is your book."
"But you were only a child then." he
persisted. "And I have been abroad
ever since." Â»
"Sure, but children have good memo
ries, you know."
"You must have been a lovely child,"
he murmured reflectively. The girl
frowned.
"I really must go," she repeated. Max
well took a hasty step forward.
"Please don't. And forgive me. And
won't you tell me who you are?"
The girl ehook her head decidedly.
"I only tell my name to my friends."
"And are not we friends?"
She opened wide eyes. "Not yet, sure
ly."
"Well, let's pretend then," he urged.
The girl, gazing at him with more ap
proval, relented a little.
"Let's pretend by all means. I will

ing her hand toward the hill.
Maxwell sighed contented.
"What a lovely name. It exactly suits
your eyes. And Is Mrs. Cory your aunt,
then?" hurrying on at signs of danger.
"Why haven't I met you before? I will
come and call," reflectively. "I .love
Mrs. Cory." The girl flushed.
"No, no, you mustn't," she cried ab
ruptly. "That Is, my aunt is ill," half
confused. Then at Maxwell's puzzled
stare she broke into persuasion. "Don't
you see how the whole thing would be

Follows Villard's exhaustive account
of- the campaigns of the war wherein
he acted as war correspondent for the
New York Herald and later the
Tribune. Engrossed In the fascinat
ing recountal of the terrible succession
of momentous events which he wit
nessed, Villard has expanded the rec
ord of his . personal observation into
detailed accounts and comments upon
the more important campaigns drawn
from close study of the authorities
upon both sides. His first battle was
the disastrous affair of Bull Run, then
he became connected with the > army
of the West- His description of the
tremendous fighting at Shlloh is made
striking by the assertion that Grant
was unprepared for the blow of the.
first day's fighting. "While it was no
doubt true,*' says Villard, "that the
Union pickets were on the alert and .
that their firing gave a short - warn
ing to the Federal camps of the ap
proach of the enemy before the hostile
host was' actually upon them, it is
likewise \ incontestable that neither .
General Sherman, whose division held
the most advanced position, nor Gen
eral Grant had the remotest suspicion
that the whole rebel army was within
artillery range of the former. Wit
ness Sherman's report by field tele
graph on that very Saturday afternoon
to Grant: 'All is quiet along my lines
now. The enemy has cavalry, in our
front, and I think there are two regi
ments and one battery six miles out-L
And still later In the day he reported
further: 'I do not apprehend any
thing like an attack upon our posi
tion.* Witness, further. Grant's dis
patch to superior, authority â¢ on the
same day: 4 I have scarcely the faint
est idea of an attack being made' upon
us, but -will.be prepared should such
a thing take place.* " " ' .
.Villard was present at 1 , the woeful
battle of Fredericksburg.and was the
first correspondent to get the news to
Washington. He saw the attack of
the ironsides upon Charleston forts
in /63. The " battles of Murfrees
boro, Chickamauga * and Chatta
nooga command the most able of all
Villard's efforts. Though- fever" pre
vented Villard from active duty In this*
campaign, he has made an elaborate
study of its tactical problems, which
reflects very greatly upon " the char
acter of Rosecrans, the commander of
â¢ the Federal forces.' With the close
of this campaign. Villard's com
mentaries upon ', the war come to an
abrupt end and the next and last
book comprises a hurried ; resume of
his successful career as a Â¦ railroad

â¢many despairing faces are turned.
.This novel of Miss- Mlchelson's, the
outgrowth of a little story of hers
which appeared in Alnslee's Magazine,
hits upon a decidedly new theme in con
temporary fiction, a thing, by, the way,
which is in itself deserving of especial
mention^ There have been stories of
gentleman rogues, and lady adventur
esses aplenty, but the tale of a full
blooded lady- crook and shoplifter who
finds her redemption ; out of her own
heart is something refreshingly unique.
Miss Michelson's. Nance Olden is as
sprightly a young creature as .one
would meet in a month of Sundays.
Miss Michelson has gone at her story
in the right way. ; Instead of looking
down on her, plot from. a distant place
and developing her heroine's character
through ', the* clumsy, medium of % the
third person, the, author puts. the. whole
story into the. delightfully fantastic
mouth of -Nance,, the waif from the
"Cruelty." It rieeds no' lengthy disser
tations upon , Nance's i unhappy v - child
hood and" the. application of the sta
tistics .of 'crime "to 'account' for her
seemingly hopeless degeneracy at -the

Although considerable historical mate
rial concerning the Jews has been col

and Herman Rosenthal, respectively. ::
Under the heading, "Gregory . the
Great," on page 90, one finds a brilliant
article on the attitude of this- eminent
Pope toward the Jews, written by Dr.
Hermann Vogelsteirv rabbi at Konigs

work on the "History- of the Jews of

section of this article is supplied by
Dr. I. Broyde, .who tells us that in
rabbinical times "a man who, curled
his hair was regarded as a vain person.
At the age of 17 Joseph was still termed
*na. f ar,' or lad, because he was childish
enough to curl his hair. -Elijah had

THE "Memoirs of Henry' Villard"
is a book of strong appeal. The '
American loves to read of a |
successful fight, whether It be
against a foe in the field or a niggard
ly and resisting fortune. Henry Vil- â¢
lard, who came to the land of promise
from his home in Germany a poor out
cast boy. sans purse and sans friend,
died a millionaire, the man of * many
affairs, the captain of industry; that
way a good light, and that it is which
will appeal to the restless, striving
American. But aside from this rec
ord of strenuous endeavor Villard's
posthumous memoirs have a value
from another i>oint of view. Few peo
ple know, perhaps, that this builder of
railroads and strong nan in Wall
street was ujkmi the grounds when tha
tremendous history, of the Civil War
was in the making. As correspondent
for various New York papers, Villard
was In the thick of the fighting from
Hull Run to Chattanooga. It is the
careful transcript from his persona^
observation of these great events, in
corporated to make the major part o*
his story, that gives his "Memoirs" an
historical importance.
Unfortunately for those who would
know thoroughly the*v.hole record of
Villard's varied activities, the autobi
ographer has chosen to dwell at great
length upon his early life and experi
ences in the Civil War to the sacrifice
of much that would be fascinating
reading were he equally as cyclopedic
in recording the period of his financial
triumphs and his pioneering in West
ern railroads. But ill health intervened
to prevent Villard's completion of his
memoirs upon the scale which he had
mapped out, and he was forced to .
make only a "compendium" of his ac
tivities from 1863 to ISS9â a brief 125
pages in which the writer drops the
ego which had made the previous
pages so absorbingly interesting and
writes from the distant formalism of
the third person. Notwithstanding the
fact that throughout the narrative we
are given pen pictures and personal
Judgments of such men as Stephen A. Â¦
Douglas, Lincoln, Grant and Sherman,
Villard himself is the most command
ing figure in the book. Simple and
unassuming in his recountal of his life
struggle, free to criticize and free to
acknowledge himself in error, seeming
to view his remarkable achievement!
from a purely Impersonal view, yt*
finding in them something of interest
from a quaintly objective standpoint,
Villard reveals himself without boast
ing â a character which strikes our im
agination and arouses our admiration.
Villard was born in Bavaria in 1835,
the son of a hard-headed Justice of the
Supreme Court. Hardly . had young
Henry's gymnasium course been fin
ished when there arose between himself
and his father a dispute as to what his
life work was to be. Despairing of
winning his father over to his way of
thinking young Hilgard, or Villard, as
he called himself after leaving the
fatherland, left for America in 1853
without a groat in his pocket over and
above his passage money and with not
the slightest knowledge of the English
language. The space within which this
review must be confined does not per
mit of a resume of the long series of
struggles which the boy made both in
New York and in the van towns of what
was then the West before he succeeded
in becoming the correspondent of the
New York Staats Zeitung to "cover"
the Lincoln-Douglas debates in Illinois.
Villard'e accounts of the historic de
bates are somewhat meager, but the
picture he gives of Lincoln as that
great man first impressed him is one
cf the most noteworthy things in the
bÂ«,ok. With characteristic frankness
Villard says that the gawky, untutored
backwoodsman disgusted him outright
with his provincial manners and coarse
speech.
"As far as all external conditions
were concerned there was nothing In
favor of Lincoln," says Villard. "He
had a lean, lank, indescribably gawky
figure, an odd-featured, wrinkled, in
expressive and altogether uncomely
face. He used singularly awkward, al
most absurd, up-and-down and side
svise movements of his body to give
emphasis to his arguments. His voice
was naturally good, but he frequently
raised it to an unnatural pitch. Yet
the unprejudiced mind felt at once that,
while there was on the one side a skill
ful dialectician and debater arguing a
wrong and weak cause, there was on
the other a thoroughly earnest and
truthful man, inspired by sound con
victions In consonance with the true
spirit of American institutions. There
was nothing in all Douglas' powerful
effort that appealed to tne higher in
stincts of human nature, while Lincoln
always touched sympathetic chords.
Lincoln's speech excited and sustained
the enthusiasm of his audience to '.he
end."
So much for the Lincoln of the po
litical rostrum. As to the man in
social converse, Villard is not at all
backward in expressing his convic
tions. Says he:
"I was introduced to Lincoln at
Freeport and met him frequently
afterward In the course of the cam
paign. 1 must say frankly that, al
though I found him most approach
able, good-natured and full of wit and
humor. I' could not take a real per
sonal liking to the man,- owing to an
inborn weakness for which he was
even then notorious and so remained
during his great public career. He
Â¦was inordinately fond of Jokes, anec
dotes and stories. He loved to hear
them, and etill more to tell them him
self out of the inexhaustible supply
provided by his good memory and of
his fertile fancy. There would have
been no harm in this but for the fact
that the coarser the Joke, the' lower
the anecdote and the more striking
the story, the more he enjoyed them.
The Life Labor
of Henry Villard
In a succeeding paragraph . Villard
gives another picture of the grat Pres
ident which Is supreme in its essence
of unconventionallty. ' Meeting ..by
chance at a lonely flag: station near
Springfield, the young correspondent
and the young politician were forced
to take refuse from a thunderstorm
within a friendly freight car. There,
with his lanky legs hoisted up about
his ears, the future President con
fided to Villard his wife's ambition
that he should be some time the
highest man in the land. "Just think
especially when they were of bis Â«wn
invention." .

"Slack away your spanker sheet," he
ordered next.
A man did so. but the block on the
boom Jammed. The mate leaned over
the railing to overhaul the sheet. Sud
denly it cleared, and the boom shot
out with a Jerk to leeward. The mate
had been leaning against the boom, 30
naturally he went with It, but not hav
ing wings he fell, and a minute later
was shouting in the ship's wake.
The mate's watch was made up
partly, of Melbourne larrikins and part
ly of Frisco roughs, an unwholesome
mixture. Olafsen had not been very
courteous to them on ihe trip, and
they remembered it now of all times.
The ship was making a good six
knots, and even had -the helmsman
brought her up into the wind It would
have taken a good hour to pick up the
mate. But the wheel remained un-
they paid no heed. An hour later, the
man at the wheel cast loose a life buoy
and roared out: '
"Man overboard!"
The captain came on deck, all hands
were called, the ship was hove to and
a boat lowered. They, spent an hour
hunting, but ; of course it wasn't Jlkely
that they would find a man dropped
six miles astern. ' : â¢ ..
A week after the Aloha came into
Honolulu and officially reported her
mate lost at sea. , . , ;
The Aloha .hauled up . alongside the
railroad dock and began discharging
her cargo of coal. -The, crew were em
ployed- on deck manipulating burtons
and whips and driving winches^ while
the Kanakas filled the buckets below.
By Saturday you could no longer Jump
down ' the hatchways to the top of the
cargo.
It. was nearly noon. The men ex
pected to knock off early and were in
ing big Steve at the burton. The man
driving, thVfor'd'l winch stood stiff, hia
face; the color i of -a snake's, belly, his
eyes bulging. The others were about
to swear at' him, -but following. : his
rigid gaze, horror likewise, stiffened
them. Complete; .'stillness ,had s come
over the .busy scene. . '".". All .eyes .were
fixed I on something on the dock.' . "
Picking its way \ through the line of
freight cars on: the r wharf came the
towering figure, of the "drowned" mate

The Aloha had cleared the doldrums
and had barely caught the northeast
trades. It happened in the morning
watch, about 5 o'clock. The yards
were braced sharp up on the port tack,
and if the Aloha was making her
course, that was about all. The mate,
enifflng the wind, to take prompt ad
vantage of any favorable change, kept
faithful watch by the weather mizzen
rigging. The men were Just taking cof
fee when the breeze hauled aft a trifle.
Instead of waiting until they had fin
ished, Olafsen gave the order to square
From a Eallor's point of view this
was an ideal run, and the Aloha was
a first rate ship for living and easy to
handle, but her crews Invariably left
at the end of each passage. Few made
a full trip. As they didn't stop to col
left their wages, the owners found it
profitable to retain Trig Olafsen in
their service. But on one trip they
almost lost him.
IF you have knocked about Hono
lulu much you will have heard of
Trigr Olafsen. perhaps you are
a stranger there. Then go down
to the docks some Sunday morning
when the seamen are loafing about the
gangways' and ask. They will sing
> ou the saga of Trig Olafsen. It will
cuiiie couched In language hideously
profane, but no matter, you will learn
all about Tris: Olafsen.
Perhaps, if they are in a good hu
m<-r. they will tell you of Trig Olafsen's
long E\v!ni with liberal criticism of the
ways cf Providence in preserving the
mdr&lly unfit. For Olafsen's notoriety
as a hard case bucko mate equals his
fame as a swimmer.
If you should ever meet Trig Olafsen
you will understand why he is feared
liig of body, arms like thljrns, gnarled
and hairy; a UdflUkc head on a bull
neck, a tawny mustache drooping over
ponderous jaws ar.d hair of the most
liery hue â such a man is Trig Olafsen.
Sailors on the West Coast will rule or
be ruled. Trig Olafsfn has never been
ruled in spite of many efforts on the
part of insubordinate crews to sub
due him. A crowd of Irishmen tried
It once on the Island Queen, but Trig
piled Into them and smote with the
mighty arm of his Viking forefathers.
Those were the days when Dave Kala
kaua's banner floated from the palace
towers and from the gaffs of a dozen
good sailing ships. Trig Olafsen was
mate of the Hawaiian bark Aloha, then
in the sugar, lumber and coal trade â
coal from Australia to Honolulu, thence
to San Francisco with sugar and back
to Australia with Puget Sound lumber.

is a few keys lower than a bull's bel

You bet!"
On heroes. With him. you' se* th*
white sails fade. out on th* horizon,
and >wlth him you are alone In -. the
great circle. Drunk as b* is, he speaks
distinctly now, . carefully articulates
each word. Have you ever been out
in a small boat, alone with the gulls,
a clear horizon and land a thousand
miles away 1 No! He has. It's a sen
sation that sets the entrails wriggling
t within you.
"But think, then," he continues,
pointing a huge gnarled forefinger at
you, "think, then â how would you feel
without a boat in mldoccan, with a
clear horizon about you? How would
you ; feel then?"
- You know â with his eyes looking Into
yours. You know you would throw
up your hands and sink. But noâ not
with that fiery hate in you tUat burns
in your very bowels. You would fctrim
â swim â swim!
You are always with him â with htm
as he treads water, or strikes out,' or
floats, looking up into the, blue cloud
less sky. You see the froth In his
fiery hair, the spume in his tawny mus
tache, sometimes floating about his
mouth like a seaweed, ana those bugs
white limbs moving under water. And
you see that broad, square chin beat
against the wavelets like the prow of
a Viking pirate ship. So hs fougrht.
ten long hoursâ fought while the son
climbed up the. center of the metallic
dome of the heavens and began to. de
scend again, and the screaming gulls
circled about his head and even lighted
near by.
Here he pauses once more, and tells
you he sank â only for a second, mind
you,- but he sank.' A picture* flashed
before him. He saw the men of bis
; watch stalking about the . streets of
Honolulu. He saw ' them in the drink
ing shops leaning against tha bars. H*
heard -them telling how ha had
drowned and they chuckled and ogled
one another. He saw big Stev* grin
as he said: â¢ , .,
"Poor sucker, we'd *a' picked him up
if we could." ' .
Sink! Neverl He could swim â a
thousand miles. He could swim in spit*
of hell Itself. :
v He must have been a fearsom* sight
then, shooting up again above thÂ» sur
face like a sea demon, snouting venge
ance. Neverl He will swim â erwim â
swimâ swim! .
By this time he is pretty drunk. It
he were an ordinary man you would
say he was nervously unstrung. But
Trig Olaf sen has no nerves, so he's- only
beastly drunk. But still you feel thÂ»
thrill of -fire In that last spurt.
' The captain recoveredâ no ; drowned
man could swear .like that, no living
man _ could swear like that but Trig
Olafaen, in- flesh and blood. "
The skipper and the mate approach
ed each other, but what they said the
watchman could not hear. ' Finally
both went below Into the cabin.
None of the mate's watch came
aboard that night. The men of the
other watch came straggling aboard
toward dusk. They had no guilty con
sciences to keep . them '., away. The
others made for ;the : hills up by the
Pall and were captured Â¦ by the police
next day and brought 'aboard in irons.
The mate. himself, conducted the hunt,
but' lodged no complaint against them
âhe only wanted . them .with him on
the passage to; Frisco. \
Â¦ ';â¢; Of : course he/ left 'â¢ Honolulu on the
Aloha as - mate. "*Â¦-.'. \ The/ record of that
passage is lost ; to authentic history,
.but occasionally you Vneet a sailor who
Â¦: will; tell you that 1 there really is a hell,
because he has been there. ? The port
watch of the Aloha reached' Frisco
alive' that passage, but they were car
ried ; ashore on stretchers aboard the
marine hospital. launch. Nor was Trig
Olaf sen ever, heard to complain of hav
. ing gone unavenged. He always refers
to that passage with a big- complaisant
smile that sends his two-lip whiskers
up like S bull "horns.
Now to ' his . story. He only tells It
when he Is drunk. He weeps and
laughs by, turns, but you do neither â
you listen, spell-bound. And after he
has finished you | know why â¢ the Vik
ings .ot old ruled the sea.
'He begins by swearing at the spank
er sheet block. Never trust a spanker
sheet* block when it jams. You can't
depend on.it;. it's treacherous, he says,
it usually takes five beers to bring him
through a treatise on Its proper man
agement. About then he will plunge
into his story, as he plunged into the
tropical sea '. that dark morning.
I When Â¦ he rose he saw the Aloha's
stern fading -into the darkness.
"Haul . in on your fore braces," he
roared, expecting to hear the shouts
of the watch and the rattle of blocks
and cordage. But he heard only the
lapping of . the still seething wake
about him, and then suddenly he re
alized .the, truth. The stern light
dwindled and at last danced far away,
a" mere speck.
v I can Bee him yet as he described
that moment. The dark pupils of his
pale-blue eyes spread, and .those big.
mustaches stood straight out as.
though he .had a stick between his
"clenched teeth. '""';""
I ,"De \ hounds," he j grinds, ."dey vill

roars as he did in th* water. "You

and if I can't tow my blasted carcass
dat farâ I swim In spirit. I: vill haunt
you â on de night vatches â I will haunt
you till you yoump overboard!"
, He doesn't â¢Â¦â¢ say. so, but you know
that he. peeled oft his clothes and
struck out after the ship. His power
ful jaw is set, and the muscles under'
his ears are like huge walnuts. When
he sees the .bark, by the light of the
breaking dawn, j miles ahead, and they
have hoy* her to. - As he mounts the
crest of a wave. he sees a boat put off.
Here he usually laughs.
"By gumâ it vas funny.' You know

of merriment. Here ha pauses, nor

of .two more beers. Â¦ His \ mustache

into those sea-gray eyes.

.Captain .Baumgarten. was an. old
campaigner. In the Eastern provinces,
and before - that - ; in" Bohemia, he ! had
learned the "art of quartering." himself
upon the enemy. While the butler
brought his supper" lie occupied" him
self in making his. preparations for; a
comfortable night. He lit thecande
labrum Af ten candles upon the center
table. The lire was .already burning
up, crackling- merrily, 'and" sending
spurts of blue, pungent smoke into
the- room." He was tired and hungry
after his : long: tramp,: so he threw -his
sword,, his . helmet and . hi3 revolver
belt' down upon a chair, and Â¦ fell , to*
eagerly upon hisj supper. â¢â¢: Then,'- with
his' glass of wine before him" and^his

per, in >the ancestral hall; of/-* these

was hot.'.and the^ captain's: eyes * were

"Those thousand francs, colonelâ"
"Not a eou until your story has been
tested. Come! ' Who Is it who .has
murdered my men?"
"It is Count Eustace of Chateau
Nolr."
"You lie!" cried the colonel, angrily.
"A gentleman and a nobleman could
not have done such crimes.".
The peasant shrugged his shoulders.
"It Is evident to me that you do not
know the Count. It is this way, col-.
oneL What I tell you is the truth, and
I am not afraid that you should test
it The Count of Chateau Noir is a
hard man; even at the best time he
was a hard man. But of late he has
been terrible. It was his son's death,
you know. His son was under Douay,
and he was taken, and then in- escap
ing from Germany he met his death.
It was the Count's only child, and, in
deed, we all think that It has driven
him mad. With his peasants he fol
lows the German armies. I do not
know how many he has killed; but it
is he who cuts the cross upon the fore
heads, for it is the badge of his house."
It was true. The murdered sentries
had each had a saltlre cross slashed
across their br^ws, as by a, hunting
knife. The colonel bent his stiff back
and ran his forefinger over the map
which lay upon the table.
"The Chateau Noir is not more than
four leagues," he said.
"Three and a kilometer, colonel."
"You know the place?"

the Aisne and to the south of the Loire.
Black and bitter were the thoughts
of Frenchmen when they saw this weal
of dishonor slashed across the fair face
of their country. They had fought and
they had been overborne. That swarm
ing: cavalry, those countless footmen,
the masterful guns â they had tried and
tried to make head against them. In
battalions their Invaders were not to be
beaten, but man to man or ten to ten
they were their equals.
Colonel von Gramm of the Twenty

He commanded In the little Norman
town of Les Andelys, and his outposts
stretched amid the hamlets and farm
houses of the district round. No French
force was within fifty miles of him, and
yet morning after morning he had to
listen to a black report of sentries
found dead at their posts or of forag
ing parties which had never returned.
Then the colonel would go forth "in
hie wrath, and farm-steadings would
blaze and villages tremble; but next
morning there was still that same dis

he could not fhake off his invisible ene

in his wooden chair withhis feet upon
a box, while a bottle of white wine
stood with a half-filled 'tumbler "upon

"Silence, for your life! '.The' house is

It was a cold December night when
Captain Baumgarten marched out of
Les Andelys with his twenty Poseners
and took the main road to the north
west. Two miles out he turned suden
ly down a narrow, deeply rutted track,
and made swiftly for his man. A thin,
cold rain was falling, swishing among
the tall poplar trees and rustling in tha
fields on either side. The captain
walked first with Moser, a veteran ser
geant, beside him. The sergeant'e wrist
was fastened to that \ of â¢ the* French
peasant, and it had been whispered in
his ear that in case of an ambush the
first bullet flred would be through, his
head. Behind them the twenty infan
trymen ploded. along through the dark
ness, with their faces sunk to the rain
and their boots squeaking in" the soft,
wet clay. "

at a place. "where two ' high â¢ pillars,
crowned with some heraldic stone
work, flanked a* huge iron gate. ! The
black chateau lay In front of them.
ThP moon had shone out between two
rainclouds, and threw the. old house

"Send Captain Baumgarten to me at

The officer who answered the sum

jawed, blue eyed, with a curving yel
low mustache and a brick-red face
which turned to an ivory white where
his helmet had sheltered it. As a sol

brave. The colonel could trust him
where a more dashing officer might be
in danger.

huge giant whose blows were raining

half senseless, he staggered to his feet

Into the great oaken chair.* He sobbed
In his impotent anger and shame.
"My boy was frequently moved to
tears by the humiliation; of his posi

understand mVwhen I say'that It Is a
bitter thing to' be, helpless in the hands
of an insolent and remorseless enemy.

. "Well, . to â¢ continue my storyâ at the
end of a fortnight my son and his
friend escaped. I need' not trouble you
with the dangers which :~they ran or
with the privations which they en
dured. Suffice it that to disguise them
selves they had .to take the clothes of
two peasants, whom they -waylaid In
a wood. Hiding by day and traveling
by night, they had got as far Into
France as Remllly, and were within a
mile â a single mile, captainâ of crossing
the German lines when. a patrol of
Uhlans came right upon them. Ah!
it was hard, was it not, when they had
come , so far and 'were j so near to
safety?".- \
Â¦ The Count blew. a double call upon
his -whistle and three hard-faced peas
ants, entered the room.
VThese must represent . my Uhlans,"
said he. , "Well, then, the captain in

French soldiers- in civilian dress with

them, without trialor ceremony. I

Â¦ The unfortunate soldier was dragged
from his chair to where a noosed rope
had Jbeen flung over one of the huge
oaken rafters which spanned the room.
The cord was slipped over his head and
he felt 1 its harsh grip round his thro**:.
The , three peasants seized the other
end and looked to the Count for his
orders. The officer,' pale but firm,
folded his arms and stared defiantly
at the man who tortured him.
. "You are now face to face with
death,- and I perceive from your lips
that you are praying. My son was
also face to face with death, and hÂ«
prayed also. It happened that a gen

deal out of it. Here is the tale as it
Inches too long In iront. The back can
be anywhere from six inches on the
floor to a foot, or any length that fancy

"It Is very trying upon a stout
woman," declared a fashionable dress
maker, "to have her gown so very long

the long skirt embarrasses 'her. But,
if the stout woman only knew it, the

The Bands of Canvas.
Another ornament that must not for
a moment be forgotten is the embroid
ered ' band.: â¢ The bands of canvas em
broidered in flowers,' or in a vine, or In
a Roman pattern, cannot be counted.
â¢The variety is endless. These bands
are used for â belts, for cuffs and for
the. orthodox waist -trimmings. They
are . in cross *; stitch, in â¢ key stitch, in
embroidery stitch and in Kensington.
; The colors are many.
One of the prettiest set of bands Is
made upon a foundation of heavy linen
In cream color. . The pattern is a Jap
anese one* and the bands "are sufficient
for stock,. cuffs, and for the trimming
of vest and skirt.
A trimming that Is to be much seen
is the trimming which consists or
bands of material. These stitched
bands are employed upon, skirts andU
waists and are finished: with a fancy^
button, or with a deep fall of lace.
The . . plain . ' stitched i band, finished
with a deep fall of lace, is a feature of
the spring sleeve; . and some of the
most charming sleeves are finished
with the wide stitched " ; band below
which falls a frill of lace at least three
fingers wide. This lace is beautifully
done ; in- colorsâ that; is, the pattern is
picked out with embroidery stitched
in 'many tones. -/
Lace is a 'thing which has undergone
a complete change. "From being a- dell
' cate ; fabric, closely connected with
heavy expense/ the laces of to-day are
made of many different threads, coarse
as well as fine, wood fiber as well as
thread, and are turned out in all sorts
of shapes from the great-piece of lace
which is one of the features of modern
dressmaking to the deep points of lace
which are to be used for flouncings.
Â¦Among the new sleeves can be count
ed at least half a- dozen that are very
distinctive in style. There is ther^
sleeve, which is shaped like a crook
neck squash. It Is long and tapering
until it '.. reaches the main portion,
where it widens out into a deep shape.
This kind of sleeve Is. now made all a
mass of tucks. At the wrist it is side
plaited into a wide band of goods,
which is 'covered with a cuff of lace,
which is finished with a big chou of
ribbon, or a , rosette .of cloth. â¢
The Ldvely Sleeve Fashion.
Then there is the delightful old sleeve
which, is shirred very 'full into the
armhole. It falls limp and baggy to the
/wrist, where it is trimmed with r.# less
than six ruffles, each one bordered with
narrow lace. These' ruffles reach al
most to the elbow and the effect is
decidedly quaint. >
The umbrella sleeve. Is lovely and is
best described by Its* name. If it could
be "lifted" it would form a very nice
parasol : cover. As it is it is gathered
Into -I the 'armhole and falls in many
points .around â¢ the - hand. Underneath
there lsvV lingerie cuff over which th*^
I points; make a s very , nice trimming.
.There' is the bag. sleeve, which is very
. much liked arid which can be employed
upon; many,; gowns. . It is suitable for
: all ''materials; from , sprigged lawn to
broadcloth. This sleeve has its fullest
part underneath. It i3 gathered into a
". band; of. embroidery Just below the
elbow. "And; from ; this band of em
: broidery, Â¦'â¢".there '. falls, a flounce of the
dress goods, arranged in such a way as
to .cover' the .knuckles.'
V,Thesej long [sleeve flouncings, or ruf
fles, would, not be \ novel were It not
that they "are ; made' 6f_ the same mate
rial as the'dress.^ A gown of chiffon
broadcloth in a shade of leaf green had
a deep ; broadcloth -ruffle around the
hand 'with a- heavyV braided trimming

Ing.
But there are . many novelties of
spring and early summer, so many that
one pauses before them In admiration,
If not in amazement. The styles have
shanged materially and there is no such
thing as dullness in Dame Fashion's
world.
One. of 'the pretty.fads of fashion. is
the flat chou. of ribbon with a paste
buckle In the middle of It.
Another fad -is- the, .".windmill -bow,
with a fancy rhlnestoiie button sewed
In the middle. . v .
Still another fancy is a metal button,
with a little frill of lace set around it.
And there is also a ribbon chou, which
has wings like butterfly wings, with a
long, slender pin fastened in the middle
to represent the body, of I the. butterfly.
Dressmakers; both French and
American, emphasize the Importance of
this, and they urge their patrons to
r-ave the gowns cut at least three
Do not make the mistake, if you are
building your own skirt, of making^ it
walking length in front and trailing:
length in the back. On the contrary^
while long in the back, it is also very
long in the front. This skirt must be
so lengthy that you can step on it and
bo very full that you actually must lift
it a little in the front in order, to move
about.
Many of the street skirts are abso
lutely unmanageable. But they will be
worn more for piazza occasions and for
semi-full dress than for actual pedes
trianlsm. Calling skirts are of this
exaggerated length as are the skirts
for receptions and for' the house.
But the summer gown, the summer
gown proper, will have a very long
skirt, so long that it has to be lifted in
the front, and so long that it trails far
in the back; and this is the skirt which
woman has doomed herself to wear.
There is no need of trying to make
up your summer wardrobe all on the
short skirted order. True, there will
be trotting skirts and each woman will
have from one to three or four of these,
according to her trotting propensities.
But they will be the useful skirts â the
skirts for walking, the skirts for out
of doors and the skirts for shopping.
If you are looking for new ways to
make your summer gowns don't neglect
the style which calls for a straight
front breadth. This is made rather
full, for the scanty front is now out
of date. Then, at each side of the
front breadth the flounces begin. Three
deep flounces go all the way around the
ekirt, with the exception of the panel
csque front breadth. And the skirt,
which, is very long and very full, lies
in great trailing breadths upon the
floor.
Ideas for Your New Gown.
It seems as though the day had quite
gone by when a skirt could be cut out.
made up, stitched and worn without
extra thought and extra work. The
skirts of to-day are very much trim
med and there are few ekirts that are
worn without any trimming at all.
The most popular skirt trimming is
probably the rope shirring. This is
difficult for an amateur to manage, but
it can be done with patience and plenty
of material. The skirt is cut very
wide and is fastened to the belt before
the shirrings are put in, bo the dress
makers advise, and the great heavy
rope chirrings are then let Into the
Ekirt. This requires the utmost care
not to destroy the lines of the gown.
The rope EhirringB are put in on the
group order, in groups of three or four,
and are eet around the skirt, horizon
tally, making a very nice trimming.
Of course the sleeves must be shirred
to match the skirt and the waist must
be 6hirred In the same manner. This,
with the addition of a little lace, really
completes the scheme of the gown.
The fancy for trimmings that run
around the Ekirt is growing. The panel
idea is too- pretty to be lost entirely,
but it is a fact that the great majority
of gowns have trimmings that run
around the skirt. Frequently the hori
zontal trimming is combined with the
panel idea and with the very prettlesf
results.
How to Trim Your Skirt.
IT Is very likely that the queen of
the May will dress in butter color
this season, for the rage for butter
shades grows. Old butter color,
and butter in all tones. Is found in
every fabric, and the bright, cheerful
tone will govern many a summer cos
tume.
The queen of the Slay will wear a
gown trimmed with lace, for it is cer
tainly to be a lacy spring, and the lace
will be any shade, from the bright rich
yellow which one associates with but
ter, to the deeper tone, which is called
burnt straw. This is a sunburnt tone,
deep and rich, with a great deal of red
in it.
Perhaps the queen of the May will
select a champagne tone, for cham
pagne is to be very fashionable this
season. And, in that case, the lace will
be dyed to match. The dyed laces are
to quite rule the costumes of the spring.
A gown in champagne colored batiste,'
with lintn threads in it. and with a
Blender lacy line running through it.
would be very pretty. The lace must
be dyed to match the batiste and the
whole gown must be lined with the
same shade.
Gowns all of a tone are rather com
ing in this year. There "are ever bo
many blue dresses that are blue from
beginning to end. Dress material, lace,
ribbons, belt and stock are all blue.
And there are countless tan dresses
with no other coloring than the tan.
Tan linen, tan batiste, tan lawn, tan
cr-pe or tan gowns of any kind are
trimmed with lace of a slightly deeper
tone, and finished up with tan ribbons,
to be removed and freshened once or
twice a year.
The queen of the May will undoubted
ly wear a gown very much influenced
by the prevailing styles. Its skirt will
be full, for all summer gowns are made
that way, and its front will be plenti
fully trimmed. If the skirt be not one
of the exaggerated full skirts then it
will at least tns a long skirt, one of
those great sweep skirts, and it will be
plentifully and gorgeously trimmed
around the foot.

"A certain very, rich American

A GLIMPSE AHEAD AT THE MAY DAY GOWNSPROTRUDING CORSETS (Mabel)â
A' corset; which is too full over the hips
and gored sharply at the waist line* will
protrude 'In' front : even on* a' slender
form,'' unless" held'down very snugly by
the garters."' It will soon ruin the set of
your dress, so better, throw it aside aixd
get a corset which will fit correctly.
'.v SOFA PILLOWS (Elizabeth) â Pil
lows .intended for. use In a., reception
hall arid library should be dignified In
character and of dark rich colors, har
monizing ,/ perfectly ' with the general
decorations./ "Very, delicate /colors and
frivolous ' designs are suitable only for
the drawing-room or boudoir. The ex
act selection, of fabrics for pillows must
be ' determined upon" according to the
general style . of . the room * furnishings.
For "example/ if -the library has leather
covered furniture, never put a pillow
of Â¦ ord inary silk against ; such â¢ a , " back
ground ;Â¦ for no " mattv > how \ beautiful
it; may ; be in Itself i it \ will i look skimpy

Choose : heavy 'upholstery, brocade -'or

the edge* \ simply, using ; a e heavy, silk
cord to Â¦ match or. In . harmonious com
bination': of shades. / Heavy ; ; knots jtied

TO CLEAN "WHITH VELVET
(Helen)â It . Is almost impossible to
dean white velvet in a perfectly satis
factory, manner. However. It may be
greatly freshened by an application of
chloroform. First brush and beat the
velvet. free of all dust. Pin the velvet
out smoothly on an Ironing board, or It
may, be stretched "In an embroidery
hoop, and have plenty of dean white
cloths at hand. Dip a doth in chloro
form, rub lightly over the spot until *h
disappears, then, with a clean doth,
rub, over. the entire surface of the vel
vet to remove all soil on the nap. , Do
the -work very rapidly and finish Â«by
rubbing with another dean white doth.
Haste Is absolutely essential because of
the volatile nature of the cleaning fluid
and also to avoid ' a stain.
â¢"Y INCE women have taken to
playing-cards in the mornings,
v~ \ in the afternoons and in â¢ the
y*S evenings it has become a pos
itive necessity to - take greater
care of the hands and nails than ever
before. ' They are. on parade," as'' it
were. It makes no difference how
daintily you 'may be f rocked, how
prettily your hair may be dressed or
bow sweet and fresh you may look, if
rour" hAndfl . axa . rough and . the nails
.TREATING COLD HANDS (Mrs. S.
L.)â Cold, moist hands are certainly an
noying, not j to\ say embarrassing at
times,, but the 'remedy suggested, will
overcome the trouble In the majority
of ; cases. -This condition of the hands
results from _averal causes, the most
common being general debility, nerv
ousness and impaired circulation. Are
you quite sure â¢ that the armholes in
your Iwalsts . and other garments, espe
ciallyypur coats, are sufficiently loose?
Pressure I at this , point will alone \ fre
quently; cause the annoying perspira
tion of which you complain. If satis
fled : this ls\not at the bottom of the
trouble, build up the system by a good
tonic and nourishing foods. Follow the
regular weekly baths with a tonic bath
and a; brisk rubdown. Put alcohol and
cool water, equal parts, into a bowl
and /sponge the entire body quickly.
An astringent-*f6nlc solution should be
applied to the/hands, especially the
palms and the under side of the fingers.
Then dust with talcum powder . and
wipe "away ' all superfluous particles.
Dusting the inside " of all kid gloves
with talcum : powder will also . assist In
them i from the effects of
moisture until a cure is effected. An
excellent astringent f solution Is made
by steeping a large handful of white
oak bark (obtainable at any. drug store)
In. one quart of water for two or three
hours.^ Strain ' the fluid, which ; should
measure about one pint, and add one
"ounce- of .'alcohol/ Pour: into a bottle
having, a sprinkle top and keep in a
cool place." Moisten the hands with . the
solution several times each day and rub
vigorously Into the palms.
AROMATIC BATHS (Emlly>â Am a
nerve soother there is nothing equal
to an aromatic bath. Take 30 grams
of pure alcohol and 2 grams each of
essence : of thyme and essence - of ro
marin. Pour into the warm bath wa
ter and mix thoroughly. After tha
bath dry the skin thoroughly, but not
too briskly, so that the sedative effects
of the bath may be retained, i Retire
to bed as soon after the bath as pos
sible, and you will sleep.
FACIAL DEFORMITY IN EXPRES
SION (Babette)â An artist may catch
the most remarkable facial expressions
by simply studying the faces of those
whom . he meets on the street. Even
the casual observer has noticed the
most remarkable expressions which flit
over the faces of those he meets, and
without apparent cause. Ugly frowns,
peculiar squinting of the eyes, twist
ing of the lips are some of the com
mon facial deformities, and all of them
leave their marks on the countenance.
If one has a bad facial expression do
not hope to get rid of it by massage
or any other treatment unless you are^
willing to break the bad habit. Find
your weakness in this respect, using a
hand mirror as an eye-opener; it will
show you facial faults of which your
dearest friends would never remind
you. Lest yon forget, havec several
mirrors hung at convenient places and
seek to remedy the faults; do this and
good massage will, in time, remove the
trouble.
â¢ SUPERFLUOUS HAIR (Mrs. M. S.)â
The only way to 'successfully and
permanently remove superfluous hair
is by the electric needle in "the; hands
of }a; skin specialist. Do not think of
Attempting the work " yourself/ for you

CARE OF ; THE TEETH (Four Plain
Girls)â To lose the teeth by accident or
from uncontrollable natural causes is a
misfortune, but to neglect sound or
filled teeth; is inexcusable. Health aa
well as good "appearance depends so
greatly upon sound teeth that it Is
strange one has the courage to neglect
them even for a day. It Is true arti
ficial teeth are readily obtainable and
so cunningly fashioned as to almost
defy detection, but the real article Is
surely to be preferred, rso matter how
plain a face may be it is redeemed by
well-cared-for teeth, while a beautiful
face loses its charm if the opened lrps
disclose poor or uncared-for, teeth.
Â¦While nature does not treat us all alike
in the matter of good teeth we can
preserve such as we have with the. aid
of powder, brush and dental floss, with
the occasional assistance of the skilled
dentist. A good brush is essential, one
having moderately soft bristles being
best. Stiff brushes ruin the teeth, loosen
the filling and irritate the gums. Brush
the teeth upon rising in the morning
and before retiring and promptly re
move all traces of add as well as
sweets by rinsing the mouth with luke
warm s water soon after eating such
things. Pure lemon Juice or any add
which sets the teeth, on edge should
beavoided. Do not pick the. teeth: It
is an unpleasant habit, to say the least,
and may loosen the teeth. Remove any
collections - between the teeth with a
piece of dental fioss, slipped up and
down without irritating tne gums. For
sensitive gums rinse the mouth several
times daily with .a /good antiseptic.
Listerine- i3 excellent, using one tea
spoonful to a glass of water. A dainty,
inexpensive tooth powder- is made by
mixing four ounces of* precipitated
chalk with one ounce each of pulverized
orris root, borax and powdered myrrh.
Sift through 'a piece of fine cheese
cloth or lawn and bottle.
COSTUMES AND ACCESSORIES
(Betty)â It is unwise to spend the
major part of the allowance for cloth-
Ing in costumes and attempt to econo
mize on the little things which add so
much to one's good appearance. Im
maculate gloves and shoes and a be
coming hat will reclaim a dress which
Is not quite up to date, but the lack of
the correct "little things" win spoil
the effect of the most stylish costum9
ever made. Hats are a heavy item in
the expense account at best and if
economy must be practiced In this di
rection get a really handsome all-black
hat for calling, theater, etc. In prefer
ence to several hats of doubtful quality
to match as many costumes. A dressy
shape of black beaver, velvet silk or
novelty braid, with a long drooping
plume or clusters of tips and a touch
of Jet or rich lace Is suggested. Retrlm
the large hat of white mirror, velvet,
using cream silk fiber lace to cover the
slight imperfections on the right side
of the frame. Recurl the white plumes
and arrange on the left side with ends
drooping over the hair. To give char
acter to the hat, which is now lacking.
Introduce a dash of black, An aigrette
of black ostrich tips and paradise
plumes will give a dainty completion
at the base of the long ostrich plumes.
Or a large rosette of black mirror vel
vet with a cabachon of pearl In the
center may be substituted. Replace the
red berries under the brim with, a gen
erous cluster of velvet violets, shaded
from delicate mauve to a deep porple;
or use some of those delicate pink vel
vet roses which are a marvelous bit
of art bo wonderfully are the petals
molded. Theresult will be a stunning
fancy hat for evening wear. The new
est gloves are conspicuous In the very
wide stitching, or, correctly speaking,
embroidery on the hacks, either In self
color or in black.

Improvement on the old system, whea
a man was fully trained la gunnery,
whether he waa fitted for it or not, at
the expense of the country, says the
London Express. â¢'
.The only drawback to the scheme la
that gunnery is so complicated nowa
days that a man does not have time
to grasp the details thoroughly. The
Admiralty .tries t- make him'. a fight
ing machine before he is an Individual.
A sailor has three weeks' field drill,
in. which he learns to fight as a lines
man, then one week with light guns
up to the six-inch, and one week with
the heavy ordnance. During his last
week of the drill he has to go through
the others again, and frequently gets
considerably confused. .
The sailors are taken each morning
to drill on one of the ships in the har
bor, â¢ and a man may . become efficient
in his duties on a cruiser, but he la
lost when he is serÂ»t to r?ea on a battle
ship. , ' _2'-

be employed in gunnery.- The men are

It may : sound sentimental to say that
they t will prove to be able ships, -but all
the sailors firmly believe it.
January 15, Sasebo. â AH the sail
ors of Vice Admiral Togo's ship were
disappointed in their hope of welcom
ing a "Happy New Tear day" in
Japan. Some of them bade their fare
well to Japan some months ago. God
be with them â those sailors with their
eyes upon the glory of, their country!
They really expected to see the ris
ing sun of the first day in the Yellow
Sea â yes, looking upon the ruin of the
Russian' fleet wrought by themselves.
Their faces beamed when they were
summoned by Admiral Togo to the
deck to hear his words. His words?
Were they not the very notice of de
parture â of the break of war? They
gathered on the deck solemnly. The
admiral bade one to bring out the
things he had prepared. The eyes of
all the sailors were fixed. Alas, it was
a sanho of white wood. Sanho? Lit-'
tic table on which was placed a small
sword for committing harakiriâ an
honorable suicide of ancient days. The
sailors understood perfectly what he
meant by it They understood that the
time was near for going to commit an
honorable suicide. They were glad.^
On the sanho were some little sheets
of paper, which the vice admiral,dis
tributed among the sailors. They were
his advice upon how to leave their af
fectionate words with their " mothers
and sisters. The crisis Â»was near at
hand. They smiled.
There was a report that the New
Year's party would be held on board
the flagship Mlkasa. Seventy officers
were taking part The "admiral for
bade, however.'.to act or speak anything
warlike on the streets or anywhere else.
We understood the time was approach-
Ing when we were to break fire in'si

{"Â»>{HAT Japan was fully prepared to
I fight is made plain by the follow
1 ing letter from Sasebo, Japan,
I which was printed in a copy of
a leading Japanese paper that
has recently reached America. The
date of the letter â January 15 â shows
that Japan was waiting Russia's reply
only for formality's sake.- It is not
hard to see why the Japanese could be
so quick In action. When her Min
ister was recalled from St. Petersburg
her ships were waiting for a chance at
Port Arthur. ,
The translation is by Tone Nog-uchl.
a native of Japan, who has lived in
this oountry for years.
Everything Is ready. Yet they are
not departing. They begin to condemn
thÂ« Government's slowness 'in action.
They begin to call the Cabinet mem
bers cowards. "What use to wait for
Russia's reply?" they exclaim. "Is net
Russia playing a bluff? The hairy
Russlans shall see what the Nippon
spirit is.". They are only looking at the
face of Admiral Togo for his final com
mand.
It was on the afternoon of the 13th
that I got an Interview with the Ad
miral Togo. He was in his cabin,
busily engaged In writing. The papers
and some other stuff almost covered
his table. His face appeared especially
gloomy. Undoubtedly hie brain was
occupied by something important. Of
course, everything would be seriqns In
those days. He stopped his pen. and
looked upon me. And he said that ha
hoped the war could be averted. But
I thought I knew he was treating ma
like anybody else. His sparkling eyes
said "We shall fight." He gracefully
apologized for the Government's se
vere censorship.
"Japan is acting before. thÂ« whole
worldâ not only for Russia. We must
try to keep our secrets and tactics be
hind the curtain as much as possible.
Usually our Japanese make too much
noise about nothing: We must show
to the world our , reserve of strength,
and. patience. I have found the public
satisfactory so far. But I hope they
wiir continue to act quietly even when
we shall have ruined all the Russian
ships. Our sailors' ' business is only
to fight Leave everything .to vml"
dying. Think of the Princes!" ' They
cried from Joy.

near the settlement of Kharbln." eo
runs the official report of the survey
of the East Chinese Railway, the Man
churlan branch of the trans-Siberian
Railroad.
The survey and the subsequent re
port to the Czar were made In 1838. In
Just Elx vears Harbin, Russia's Far
Eastern base in her war with Japan,
has sprung from the proportions of a
fishing hairlct, with a few of its Man
churian population engaged in pressing
oil from peas and beans, and distilling
a bad brand of brandy, to a flourishing,
bustling city of 125.000. There are 75.000
Russians, not including the soldiery,
and the rest are Chinese, with a few
Manchus. Each race has Its own sec
tion of the city, the Manchus still oc
cupying the original portion, around
which thp greater Harbin has been
built. But despite these racial divis
ions Harbin is a representative boom
town, Â» "Wild West" town in every
sense, even to Its bad men, who, up
to the outbreak of hostilities, thought
nothing of shooting up the town on
occasion.
The romantic story of the Harbin
of to-day begins. with the survey of the
East Chinese, or Manchurian. branch
of the trans-Siberian Railway. The
Russian engineers engaged in the work
started across Manchuria from the
trans-Baikal provinces, working east
ward in as straight a line as possible
toward Vladivostok. This determina
tion to run a bee line to the Pacific
brought them in time to the western
banks of the principal river of Man
churia â the Sungari. Opposite them
lay the scattered mudhouse settlement
cf Harbin; twenty miles farther down
the river was the city of Khulinchen.
An American surveying party would
have made a detour to tap so flourish
ing a commercial center, but not 6o thÂ«
Russians. Harbin was In front of them.
It was on a direct line with Vladi
vostok, the road would cross the river
at Harbin, and twenty miles would be
caved.
Alter that history was made at a
rapid rate In Harbin. River steamer
after river steamer dumped Its cargo
of rails, bridge work and other mate
rials along the river banks; bridge
builders, engineers, blacksmiths, lock
smiths, carpenters, linemen, railway
doctors and surgeons, clerks and ac
countants, arrived In great "numbers
from Russia; and hundreds of coolies
â Chinese, Manchus, Koreans, Solons.
Golds, Burlats and whatnots â attracted
by the prospect of remunerative work,
invaded the little town. Harbin leaped
over night from a fishing village of &
few hundred souls to a humming rail
road center of several thousand. ..-Â¦
Then, while the railroad was being
pushed with feverish haste across the
plains in either direction, and the foun
dations for the great bridge across the
Sungari were rapidly being laid, -word
reached Harbin that the Czar had
leased the Llaotung peninsula for a pe
riod of twenty-five years from the Chi
nese Imperial Government, and a road
was to be run to Port Arthur, on the
peninsula's tip. from a point on the
East Chinese Railway, and the Junc
tion was to be at Harbin. Surveyors
were^mmediately sent out from Har
bin, and. as a result. In a few months
material' was coming in greater quan
tity than ever by steamer, more arti
sans were errivinff from Russia and
flocking from the towns , bf Central
Manchuria, and more coolies by the
thousand were being employed, for
two railways were now being built out
of Harbin instead of one.
In the meantime the railway admin
istrator, who had practical authority
over Harbin, though Manchuria offi
cials were in nominal control, had
solved the problem of supplying the
ever-growing town and the railroad's
builders with food stuffs. Harbin is

as to make her first one seem insignif

dollars are invested in meat backer-

word that he had neither guns nor

himself to execute himself. Sheng de
cided that It was no use to parley fur

promptly went over to the Russians

lot toward keeping the besieging Box

At the time of the siege 150 foreign

Russians found out as they went from
Harbin to build the railway and so an
down the rivers came supplies in am

farmers, who had been told of the
promising new market for their pro

Into the plains country to buy food-,

Consu! General John K. Gowdy. in a
report from Paris to the State Depart

minating rats and mice.
The process was devised by the Pas
teur Institute, and use Is made of. mi
crobes. ' Scientists recently experiment
ed on a tract of nearly 3000 acres, badly
Infested with 'vermin. Four tons of
bread and nine tons of - oats were used
as bait. These had been treated with a
solution in. which the microbes were
cultivated, and were placed near the
holes made by the rodents.
The scientists estimated that they
killed fully 95 per cent of the rats and
mice living in the tract treated.. A field
of two ., and , a half acres was chosen,
and 12.484 ratholes were counted. These
were closed, and two days later it was
found that 1304 had been opened.
The bait was used, and eight days
later only thirty-seven holes had been
opened. Fifteen or twenty rats were
frequently found dead in one hole. The
Chamber of Deputies has been asked to
pass a law requiring, farmers to co
operate to exterminate rats with mi
crobes." . The ; Government will furnish
the solution.' The cost of the cultures
is 3 cents an acre.

the tallest fat woman in the .world,
died recently. She was 6 feet 1 inch
tall and when she died weighed 454

for her. for she had weighed as much
as 582 pounds. Mrs. I Morlan leaves a
husband, who is something of a heavy

748 pounds. Together they were the
fattest married couple, In the world:
Mrs. Morlan was 31 years old and she
had been exhibiting herself for nine
teen years. She was born In St. Louis
and was a normal child until she was

she began her career as "Anna Bell,

Anna Bell met her husband, who was
the "Indiana \ fat boy." After their
marriage they made a home for them
selves at Indianapolis and continued to

One of the most formidable problems
of coastwise navigation by which mar
iners are confronted is the difficulty -of
determining the direction from which
fog-bells and signals come, the appar
ent direction of the location of the
sound being dependent to a large de
gree on the condition of the atmos
phere. If vessels could run from light
ship to lightship infallibly by sound, as
they do by sight in fair weather, the
Improvement would amount alpiost to
a revolution In coastwise traffic.
A new srstem of submarine bell sig-.
naling. which seems to solve the prob
lem, is described in an interesting arti
cle In Harper's Weekly. The apparatus
may be briefly described as follows:
Each of the four steamers of the line
on which the system is being tried are

From their herds of reindeer the Lap- i
landers In Northern Europe take the
woolly hair and make from it blankets,
which are remarkable for their excel
lent qualities of resisting moisture and
cold. â¢ Of these blankets the United-
States Consul at Frankfort, G*ermany,
has this to say:
"A close examination of the hair of
the reindeer furnishes an explanation
of its peculiar value. The hair does
not have a hollow space inside for its
whole length, but is divided, or par
titioned off, into exceedingly numerous
cells, like watertight compartments.
These are filled with condensed air.
and. their walls are so elastic and at
the same time of such strong resist
ance that they are not broken up,
either during the. process of manufac
ture or by swelling when wet. Thf>
celjs expand in water, and thus it bap
pens that a man clad in garments
made of reindeer wool does not sink
When in water, because he is buoyed
up by means of the air contained in
the hundreds of thousands of hair
cells.. In the markets and stores of
Norway, Sweden and Russia garments
and blankets of reindeer wool are to
Â¦ be had at, lower prices than other fab
rics. In Vienna there is .a; factory
which manufactures garments of rein
deer wool,. especially bathing costumes.
For persons unable to swim the pos
session of such garments is of great
value. It is possible that they may be
utilized in learning how to swim. Re
cently successful trials have been made '
In Paris in this line. In England at
tention has been directed to this pe
culiar property of reindeer wool, and
.It is proposed to take up its manu
facture and possibly improve It."â

Â£"Tpj HE umbrella sail. Which Is an Eri-
I ffUsh invention, Is attracting at-
I tentipn of yachtsmen in all parts
A of Â» the* world. With this type of
sa.il a small boat, which could not safely
carry to exceed Â£00 square feet of can
vas with an ordinary rig,. can carry 360
square feet without danger. ' 'Â¦
In, fact", the risk. of being capsized is,
practically removed,, while
the increased speed of the boat is near
ly in proportion, to the increase In her
canvas..- The orginal boat put in ser
vice this year at Cowes, England, is
only 17 feet on the water-line, but car
ries r an umbrella sail which measures
;30 feet horizontally, and 16, feet, up and
down. The sail also serve's-as an.im
mense awning. _ The American Ship
builder says the chief feature' of the cy
clone sail, which is practically a large
umbrella, is that the. wind pressure on,
it has no effect whatever to incline the
boat. ' Roughly speaking, 1 the pull of
the sail is at right angles to its mean
.urfaceâ that is to say, "in the direction
9t the mast. . , t â¢
In other words. It; may be described
as a kite held by a' rigid string. If the
mast were stepped quite oh the lee side
of "the boat~, it is evident that" the sail
would lift the lee side and so list th?
boat to windward; and If the mast wer<Â»
stepped on the weather side, lifting thÂ«
weather side of , the boat. It would
necessarily list the boat to leeward. It
follows, then, that there la some cer
tain pointâwhich happens to be slight
ly on 'the lee ' side of" the center line â
at which, if the mast is stepped, there
will be no tendency for the wind to
careen the boat at all. When actually
sailing in the boat the only way in
which one is aware j of a puff of wind
Is by noticing that the boat travels
faster and experiencing' a slight sen
sation similar, to that coming from the
acceleration -of \ the engines In a
steamer. For sailing with the wind In
different directions to â¢ the boat, the
whole mast and sail are rotated by
means of a turntable, to which ths
mast Is attached and the mast is ele
vated and - lowered by means of two
tackles. There is also a balance
weight which helps to elevate the mast
arid balance its dead weight.
The Thornycrof ts, the great English
beat builders, are experimenting- in the
expectation that the umbrella sail can
be adapted to row boats, canoes and
other small craft.
The apparatus consists of a type
writer which, by depressing a key,
j-ends two impulses. Each letter re
quires only two impulses, and the
different letters are obtained by means
of the time interval between these im
pulses. For wireless purposes these
impulses operate a switch connection
with the induction coil, thus making
the pparks for sending the ether waves.
The Induction coil is connected with
an aerial well as an earth wire. To
turn the apparatus into a receiving in
strument it is only necessary to move
a switch which is placed beneath the
typewriter. This makes all the con
nections to the receiving apparatus,
which consists of a. coherer and a very
sensitive relay.â Invention Age.
A wireless telegraph writer, or zero
graph, as It is called for the sake of
brevity, has been invented by an Eng
lishman. The zerograph, in appearance,
resembles an ordinary typewriter, but
It Is of simpler construction, with a
keyboard figured with the signs of the
letters and numerals, which J can be
printed or telegraphed to any number
of instruments. Each instrument, the
inventor explains, is at once a receiver
and a transmitter,, enabling operators
to corvprse wish ore rnr he* in writ
ing, and thus obviating misunderstand
ings, which are apt to occur jn tele
phonic communications. So far mes
sages have been sent only for a short
distance, but it is intended to experi
ment over wider spaces, and it is hoped
that messages can be sent to any dis
tance that ether waves will carry. The
machine is always ready for imme
diate use, and as there is no mechan
ism which requires to be wound up in
order to obtain synchronism, the ope
rator has both hands free for manipu
lation. -
jj Measurements taken by the surgeons
of the Japanese 1 army show that the
Japanese smallness'of stature is due to
an almost dwarfed condition of the
legs. This Is probably due to the fact
that from early childhood a really un
natural wav of sitting is constantly
practiced. "The adult Japanese is ac
customed to sit with, his legs bent un
der him. As soon as the child is old
enough to be set upon the fioor'hls legs
are bent under him In Imitation of the
custom of his elders. This in time
dwarfs the growth of the limb. This
actual deformity is less common among

responsible or broken bones and
maimed hands in the ring. In the re
cent battle between Young Corbett and
Jimmy Britt the latter's most Berious
injury was self-inflicted. In Just about
the middle of the contest while swing
ing at Corbett he broke his right arm
between the elbow and the wrist. This
was the second time In bis career that
he had his chances of winning spoiled
by a like injury- The reason for the
"accident" Is plain. It Is his peculiar
crouch.
Britt. like many other boxers of the
rame school, fights from a position that
does not give him the best use of his
hands. The crouch may have all sorts
of advantages as a defensive attitude,
rendering it difficult for an opponent
to reach either head or body with a
damaging blow, but at the same time
it Is almost equally impossible to strike
an effective punch from this attitude.
Not only is the driving power Impaired,
but the aim is bad. The flghter with
a crouch cannot hit as straight and
sure as the one who stands more nearly
erect. The- reasons for this are^ ob
vious to those who Lave studied the
same and ought to be doubly so to
those who take an active part in it.
For instance. In a straight left-hand
- punch one of the simplest but at the
came time most effective blows known
to the prlzerlng, the arm should be
shot out, palm upward, with all the
weight of the body behind It It should
be and when delivered properly is Just
what its name implies, a straight' arm
blow, executed with the elbow turned
slightly inward ' toward the body. In
this way the full Impact of the blow
is given with all the knuckles of a
tightly closed fist. There '.is; no danger
whatever, unless the fingers of the
hand are out of proper, proportion, of
breaking any of the -bones of the fin-,
gers, wrist or forearm. The best fight'
Ing hand is really a small hand, with
short chubby fingers, like Young Cor
bett's, for instance. (The. small picture
on this, page shows the proper, way of
holding the hand and arm in delivering,
a straight left hand punch. Also the
picture of the lower right hand side of
the page showing how the fist should
land against an opponent's face.)
Now it is a physical impossibility, to
strike a correct left-arm punch from
a crouching ' position. In the first
place, the fighter with the crouch uses
his left shoulder - as one of â¢ his main
defenses for his i head and Jaw. Â¦ This
necessarily compels him to turn his
arm and hand. over, palm downward.
Therefore, when - he strikes a straight
arm blow, or Â¦ rather attempts toâ for
In this way if the fight Is at afl vicious.
But of all things the tendency. of al
most every flghter of the day to wear
bandages in the ring Is the causa of
more injured bones and ruined hands
than anything else. It is all so need
less. Not one In a hundred fighters
ever applies the bandages properly, or
perhaps knows any good reason why
he' wears them at all, except on the
much exaggerated theory that they are
absolutely necessary to save the
knuckles. Invariably Instead of doing
good work they work their own Injury.
The reasons for this are plain. To
begin with the bandages are usually
applied in the dressing room, when the
fighter Is comparatively cool before en
tering :thÂ«^ ring. His body is at a nor
mal temperature. ' And I in f his stage
the adhesive rubber tape 'Is wound
â¢: round Â¦ and ' ' round , the _ knuckles, / the
wrist "and even the thumb, and .allowed
;to remain- thus all through the fight.
What happens.:, As soon as the excite
ment of the fight begins,- and the. boxer
becomes overheated, his hands- swell,
and swell &pd swell, until the v ban
dages, Instead, of being a are a
positive 'and dangerous .hindrance. The
bandages * do not stretch one Jot. 1 They
'stick fast f for, Just .the -purpose ; they
were â¢ intended. -If [anything gives It Is
the *Â¦ bones and knuckles of * the * hand
.' they, were designed ito protect.
To obviate this rdirHculty/ if bandages
must S'~ worrfj ; I , always ; insist that
they, shall be cut through .at' the palm,
after being ; applied 'and before the
gloves are donned for the contest. This
protects the" knuckles fully, while leav
ing ; the r hand Â¦ free to expand ; as , much
&s ; it'v will wftfc; the heat.
-Â¦ The; disregard f of these simple * little
; rules often .works more Injury to fight
ers than all the gruelling their Toppo
r.ent is able to administer., As In
; Britfs /case, self-Injury, is^the^ very '
worst sort. since it often results in In-
'kind It. The flghter uses nothing more
lhah the strength' of 'the arm alone,'
Instead of getting all the '.weight of his
. bodyy behind.. the. -punch, .as he. would
i flo if he fought more nearly, erect. (The
photograph on / this ; page, shows / the
-Wrong "way of striking, with the fingers
flown.)
'Another * and frequent ,Â¦ source of
broken, bones 'is both the right- and
left hand swing." Not one boxer in fifty
lands either of these blows properly,
and the result is Â¦ invariably a j broken
thumb. That used to be one of the
great difficulties with Jeffries. In near
ly all his early fights he dislocated his ",
thumbs, and it was not until he hiad
been tausht how to strike properly
that he escaped injury and at the same
time added Immeasurably to his
punching power.
The fault is that fighters do not
learn, or else they forget, that the
correct swingâ correct not merely from
the beauty and skill of the science, but
because under all circumstances it la
the most effective â should not be de-.
livered with ; the arms spreading wide
from the body and landing like flays.
It should not strike against the side
of the hand, in full impact with the
thumb, as so many ; modern v flghterÂ»
land.. In fact the thumb should. never
under any circumstances strike tha
opponent It is not an effective blow,
and self-injury is the Invariable re
sult. . .
(To illustrate more clearly what I
mean, Jook at the , picture entitled
"Breaking the thumb on the Jaw,"
on this page. Now contrast with It
the picture entitled "Correct blow'
with the knuckles.")
The correct way to land a swing of
any sort for. either the head or the body,
with either hand; . in' order; to escape
Injury to yourself \ is to turn the hand
over, palm down, crook the -elbow so
that the first knuckle will strike
fair, and square against the:
spot aimed at, ' and -- the blow
'ilsjJVnot only safe' /but terribly
damaging. And to Ian d this well so -
that it is something more than a mere
blow with the arm onlyâ a swing with
the full weight of the body behind it, ;
as" every blow, should haveâ keep -the
' arms 'as close to the sides as possible.
If this rule Is ' carried but It \ Is next to
Impossible to strike with the thumb!
It is the violation of this rule that
accounts for so many wild swings in
the * ring. A Â¦. flay-like blow gives your
opponent: every,' chance in the world to
duck' under" it; : to ; step J>aek : ' ao that It
whizzes harmlessly .past his nose- or

than it 1 - does .now. /In company "with'
but this drum. It is riot even a real
drum â not what I call a drum. It's a
little boy's' drumâ the sort of thing
' I used to play with myself, at one
time, until people took it away from
me and threatened that if they heard
it once again that day they would
break it over my own head. It's cow
ardly Koing about the street playing
a drum of this sort where' there Is
nobody to stop you. The man would
not dare to do it if his mother was
about. , He does not even play it. He
walks along tappins it with a little
stick. . There's no tune, there's no
sense in it. He doesn't even keep
time. I used to think at first, hear
ing it in the distance, that it was some
young gamin who ought- to be at
school, or making himself .useful tak
ing the baby out In the perambulator;
and I used to draw back into door
ways, determined, as he came by, to
pull, his ear for him. To my aston
ishment â for the first week â I found
it was the Belgian army, getting Itself
accustomed, I suppose, to the horrors
of war. It Is making of me a "peace
at any price" man. They tell me that
these armies are necessary to pre
serve the peace of Europe. For my
self, I should be willing to run the
risk of an occasional row. Can't some
one tell them that they are out of
dateâ with their of feathers arid
their odds \ and * ends ' of Â¦ ironmongery
â grown men that have to be sent out
for a walk accompanied by â¢ a tin
whistle and a drum out of a toy shop!
I, always think of them In connection
with the White Knight out of "All-'?,
in - Wonderland.". I take it \ that j for/
practical', purposesr-to' fight for.- your
country or ' to . fljrht - for, somebody
else's country, whichV is" generally,
speaking, more popularâ the thing nee-'
essary - is that a certain .proportion of
your Â¦ people < should- be - able to shoot '
straight with a gun. How standing in
a line and turning your toes but Is go-
ing to assist you under modern condi
tions of warfare is one of the many
things my intellect, is incapable of
grasping. In . .. medieval .days. -. when
men fought hand to hand, there must
have been advantage in combined and
precise movement. When armies were
mere iron machines the simple en
deavor of each being to push the
other off the earth, then* the striking
simultaneously with a thousand arms
was cart of the game.' Now) when we
shoot from behind cover, with smoke
less powder, brain, not brute force, in
dividual sense, not combined solidity,
is surely, the result to be aimed at.
Cannot somebody, as I have suggested,
explain to, the military man that the
proper place for the drill sergeant
nowadays is under I a glass case* in
some museum of antiquities?
I lived once, near the Hyde Park
Barracks and saw, much of the drill
sergeant's method. , Generally speak
ing, he is. a fat man/with a walk' of
an egotistical plgeon/i His voice is one
of the most extraordinary' things / In
nature. If you can distinguish it from

I was 'the ' owner of * a : fine re trlever

Onembrning he 'had 1 been; shouting

i Sunday/* morning in the drillyard of
the 'Albany Barracks. It was the opin

guard our homes. and protect our wives
and Â¦Â¦.children'^better if, first of alL we
learned ? to roll our "eyes right or left"
at the given word of command, and to
walk 'with our thumbs stuck out. Ac
cordingly a drill sergeant was appoint
ed' to instruct us on these points. He
came out of the canteen wiping his
mouth ' and flicking his leg , according
ta rule with the regulation cane. But
as , he approached us his expression
changed. We were stout, pompous
looking gentlemen, the majority of us,
in frock coats and silk hats. The ser
geant was a man with a sense of the
fitness of things. The Idea of shout
ing and swearing at us fell from him,
; and :,that gone there seemed no; happy
/medium left to him. The stiffness de
parted from his back. /He met us with
a 'deferential attitude and spoke to us

What tactics the Belgian army might
adopt under other conditions I am, of
course, unable to say,' but, against me
personally, this is the plan of cam
paign it has determined upon and car
ried out with a success that is as
tonishing even to myself. I find It ut
terly impossible to escape from the
Belgian army. I choose the quietest
and most unlikely streets. I choose all
hoursâ early in the morning, in the aft
ernoon, late in the evening. There are
moments of wild exultation vhen I
Imagine I have given It the slip. I
can't see It anywhere, I can't hear it.
"Now," I say to myself, "now, for five
minutes' quiet and peace." I have been
doing It an injustice. It has been work-
Ing round me, that Is all. Approaching
the next corner I hear the tattoo of Its
drum. Before I have gone "another
quarter of a mile it is In full pursuit
of. me. I Jump on a train. I travel
for miles. Then, thinking I have shaken
It off, I alight and proceed upon my
walk. Five minutes later, another de
tachment is upon my heels. I creep
home, the Belgian army pursuing me
with its exultant tattoo. I creep up
into my room and close the door; the
victorious Belgian army marches back
to barracks. It is too good for me. I
confess it. My insular pride has van
ished. 'Â¦'Â¦''-
If it would only follow me with a

WHILE it may be apart from
the aubject in hand, It may be
well to issue a warning to
traveling Americans who In
tend while in England visiting the homes
cf English authors, particularly that
of Jerome K. Jerome. Don't mistake
Wantage for Welllngford; walk up the
long Â«<lrlveway and ask if Mr. Jerome
lives there. The houses of the two men,
Mr. Jerome and Richard Croker, are
only a mile or less apart, and a mile in
England, as e\-ery one knows. Is the
veriest detail, especially in the country
districts. The writer made this mis
take, and it proved rather disastrous.
During the time wasted, Mr. Jerome
had taken his favorite hunter, and was
"going it" over a few fences and hedges
when a call was made at his house,
and so another appointment had to be
made. Jerome is a very punctual man.
Incidentally Americans should know
(in order to avoid all possible blunders)
that Jerome K. Jerome is pronounced
Jer-'um K. Jerome, the first syllable
being accentuated; at least so I was in
formed. His friends call him Jer-'umâ
sometirrfes indeed "Jerry," his ac
quaintances, Mr. Jerome. The Jeromes
are spelled alike, but pronounced dif
ferentlyâa little way the English have.
It Ehoulfl not be from this,
however, that Mr. Jerome is of the
genus pompous. He is simplicity itself.
Jerome has had a hard life. When
one considers what he has passed
through it Is difficult to realize how
there remains within him' enough na
tive humor to have turned out such
a work as "Three Men in a Boat" and
other tales l bf laughter. The musings
in "Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow"
strike us as Jerome-like only where
they touch us with a tinge of pathos,
when they graze the high spots. 1 The
light butterfly humor seems a strange
plant to. have, sprung from the^seed r of
hardship and want. Not that r Jerome
has 'passed through. the "log cabin -XV
the Presidency" 1 lane; but' he has "had
his troubles," njone the less/ His echoo-1
has been hardâ for a humorist. There
is more Vmeat" between the lines in
"On the Stage and. Off" than' there is
in print. The unwritten tells 'a strik
ing story of privation and Buffering, a
hard battle with harder times, a sting
ing Indictment of the theat
rical man, a plain recital of the wrongs
to which the unfortunate actor of Eng
land Is heir.

DOUBLE CONTEST TO-DAY
- Since the day when the lake had told
her that she was beautiful Charlotella
had wished to express her gladness la
every possible way. She was no longer
unkind to those about her. She no
longer felt indifferent to the beauty of
the sky and of the fields, but said to
herself again and again:
"Oh, if I had only known, If they had
only told me that I was pretty, I should
leng ago have tried not to be disagree
able." :
So Charlotella went dally from her
father's royal tent on -the battlefield
and cared for his wounded soldiers. She
bound up their wounds with soft, cool
linen and ointment of roses. Then the
people began to wonder greatly; and as
her contented mind began to show upon
her features the creases In her brow
were smoothed out and Charlotella's
ugliness was no longer so apparent.
Meantime. Fioryset In her
chamber in the tower and refused to
come * forth, except for a little while
each day, when . she walked daintily
about in the palace garden, attended by
her maids of honor. Much of the time
she spent lying idly upon her couch of
rose colored silk, gazing into her small
mirror of polished metal. She would
have liked much to visit again the won
derful lake which had shown her so
entrancing a photograph of her charm
ing self, but she was fearful of behold
ing, the ugly, sights that awaited her
In the fields that led to the lake. -
"Ah, dear," she said to her little maid
In waiting, as the latter stood beside
her wielding a great fan of long, white,
silky ostrich feathers, .while at the foot
' of her couch her little page sang softly
and sweetly to the tinkling melody of
his guitar. : "Ah. dear, I am so i sorry
Ifor papa's poor soldiers. It must hurt
dreadfully, to have a sharp lance thrust
Into one's flesh. Ugh! Sing to me again
about the spring and tha birth of the
flowers, that I may for&et the dreadful
: things outside the palace walls."
Many, years later,' and 'long after tha
: Princesses had grown old and had died,
people In the kingdom, and In far dis
tant countries, too, told .wonderful tales
oÂ£ Saint Charlotella, who they said was
once ths most beautiful Princess In thÂ»
...world. , WSSB
After this there were dreadful days
for the kingdom, when their brave sol
diers were wounded and killed, and the
field, that lay so green and smiling
beneath the casement of the Princesses,
was torn up and spotted with ugly
red pools of the blood of brave men.
Then it was that even the noblest ladles
went "forth to care for their wounded
soldiers on the battlefield, led by the
King's daughter. Charlotella.
the Princesses could Bee far, far across
the fields and beyond the lake a Ions
line of knights in black armor, who rod a
forward to meet the Kins in battle.
Neither Fioryset nor Charlotella slept
at .all well that night. Early the next
morning the young Princesses were
awakened by a great shouting below in
the -court yard. They arose hastily and,
donning their r'lkcn morning â¢ robes,
leaned out of the high casement to see
what wes causing such an uproar:
There they beheld the King,! their
father, clad in full armor, calling
loudly to his soldiers, who filled the
court yard.
Soon the iron gates of the palace
swung wide apart, and the King, fol
lowed, by his retainers, clad in metal
coats of mail and wearing shields and
lances, rode forth Into the fields bsyond.
Here he was met by ffreat companies of
his own r-oldlers, waving aloft banners
< .saarist Â«a4 blue â¢ ouJ c- id. - Boon.
She turned to Florynet and caught
her by. the hand. "Come," she said;
"come, sister; we shall 1 a late. They
will miss us and R<;nd after us; let us
go back to the palace at once."
With hands tightly clasped and their
hearts beating in time with their foot
steps, the two Princesses hastened back
to the palace garden. The gates were
luckily still open and their flight had
been undiscovered. So they betook
themselves to their tower chamber, and
there they eat and talked and talked of
the images In the wonderful lake, which
they both believed to be real.
What of sister Charlotella, who stood
beside her and watched the image of
her own form and features reflected by
the' untruthful lake? Remember that
the magic power of the water enabled
even the wicked old witch to seem
comely. .
You must lenow, therefore, that Char
lotella was gratified to bahold a charm
ing, sweet-faced maiden where she had
thought to sec a familiar ugly self. Her
hands had become small and shapely;
her fept peeped out like dainty butter
flies vrlth solden wings. Her nose was
straight: her eyes had grown large and
clear; her large and hitherto prominent
ears now lay close to her well-shaped
head and in eize were In keeping with
the rent of her pretty features.
Her girlish gown, with its emerald
girdle, set off most charmingly the soft
brown tints in her curling hair.
Charlotella gazed and gazed and
gazed. At last ehe spoke. "Oh!" she
sighed. Boftly, "I never dreamed I was
so beautiful." Charlotella's face was
pile and not at all like her rosy re
flection in the water as she said faintly:
"And I amâ I am really pretty, after
all. Why didn't they tell me so? Oh.
why did no one say so before?**
No wonder then that Fioryset stood
with her small hands tightly clasped be
fore her, appalled and unable to utter a
word at eight of her own transcendent
loveliness. â¢ â¢
Floryset, whose courage was greater
for the moment than that of her sister,
was the first to peer at her dazzling: re
flection in the shining lake. So wonder
ful was the vision that met her aston
ished gaze It seemed as though her
beauty's very radiance must melt the
fleecy blue of her partnent Into mist.
The glory of .a hundred sunsets seemed
to rest ui>on her hair. The luster of a
hundred lakes seemed reflected in her
eyes. The delicate blush of a garden
of ropes seemed to lie upon her soft
cheek, and the tint of myriad scarlet
poppies seemed to have lent bright
color to ,-the bud of her dainty lips.
Bhe had greater beauty than the sun,
moon and all the Fhinlngr stars. She
had greater beauty than th*t of all the
seasons of all the years. She had great
er beauty than that of all ths flowers
la all the fields and greater beauty than
that of all the Princesses in all the
worlds.

LONDON, April 16.â Writing to the
Lancet, Dr.VR. C. Lucas adds a new
count to - the indictment against the
corset-rnamely, that under certain cir
cumstances it may* be responsible for
cancer. . -
1 Three cases have come under the doc
tor's notice in which cancer in women
started at a point where the edge
of the corset crossed the edge of the
big muscle of the chest.' In describing
two. of them, he says: Â¦
"It occurred on the right side in rach
case and in women whose occupation
led them to undue use of the right arm,"
and in consequence,^ to excessive fric
tion cf the upper edges of the corset.
Friction. of the ~ corset /at this, spot is,
therefore,/ the cause of the -cancerous
process' developing; in this situation^
and, to express the = fact, I â¢ have given
it the name of corset cancer."

It 'was " Edward , Malona, who exDOsed
few days\ previously, he had cleared
out a whole closet: full of them and
burned them to make room for j some
partridges. Â£He had seen the, name of
Shakespeare upon some of the papers
and'his wife had said at the time that
she did no-t think he ought to have
burned them. But they were gone be
yond, recall, and the searcher had to
confine his quest to the lesser relics
of the great bard. On a later date he
went to see Mr. Taylor, who had
Shakespeare's chair.
S The Western Herald; in 1862,'in an ar
ticle upon Shakespearean relics, men
tions the chair as an "antique relic
\vhich originally belonged to the un
fortunate and last Abbot of Glaston
bury^ Richard Whiting, a man of great
learn ing and courage who, resisting the
order cjf Henry VIII to deliverjup the
property of the monastery, was charged
with embezzling some of the plate, and
by the King was sentenced' to.be hang
ed _ in 1539. ..The chair, .which is an old
Glastonbury one, subsequently . became

â There is no doubt that the .modern
craze for the collection of antique fur
niture had something to-do 'with the
discovery and treasuring of Shakes
peare's chair, although before the birth
of the nineteenth century this craze
was "in its 'earliest infancy.^. It was
about' the'.year. 1793 when | Samuel I Ire- 1
land, a well known collector and dealer
in rare MSS., of Norfolk street. : Strand,
London, . went - to Stratford^ . to ; collect
material for his work entitled "Pictur- :

Only once since the King's accession.
In fact, have the gossips allowed him
to be really 111â this being at the time
of his intended coronation, and then
they insisted on making him a good
deal worse than he actually was!
One disadvantage about being a King
is that one can't be laid up with the
slightest complaint without a lot of ru
mors immediately graining currency as
to what Is "really" the trouble or aver
ring some contretemps or other for
which the "indisposition" is supposedly
a blind. When it was announced from
Buckingham Palace last year that a
cold vt'hich the King had caught would
prevent the contemplated royal visit
to the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire
from taking place, rumor immediately
declare that Edward. VII was not ill
at all, but that the Queen at the last
moment declined to go to Chatsworth
on account of the presence there of
certain society women of whom her
Majesty is said not to approve, and so
come excuse had to be made. And
hardly had news been placarded yes
terday that the King was Buffering
from a slight chill caught at Cam
bridge than an ingenious canard was
circulated in the "West End" which
affirmed that a certain royal indiscre
tion was intended to be cloaked by the
official statement.
Hereafter expenses of this kind will
be met out of county funds, local au
thorities agreeing that royal visits ben
efit trade to an extent that warrants
an even greater outlay on their parts.
His Majesty has given his consent to
the new departure and his friends
throughout the country will be notified
of the fact.
In. the meantime Earl Cadogan and
Lord Iveagh had heard of the compli
cated state of affaire, and they, too,
tent checks covering their respective
expenses. The King's check was re
turned to him, but it was some time
before he could see that it would be
undignified for him to insist on paying
the debt incurred. The King is not a
truest in the generally accepted sense
cf the word only when he is visiting a
person similarly situated to himself.
Within his own dominions he "com
mands" and not "accepts" invitations.
The incident in Question has caused
much amusement in society circles and
it was thought that the custom was
known to every police officer in the
country.
LONDON, April 16.â When King Ed
ward makes his promised visit to the
Duke and American Duchess of Man
chester at Kylemore Castle, there will
be one bill at least in connection with
his stay which his young hosts will
not have to "settle." For the King
has just abolished the rule mde by his
mother. Queen Victoria, that .persons
to whom their sovereign paid private
visits should assume the expense incur
red for the extra police protection,
which the late Queen considered in
dispensable at such times.
This incident, through which the
King learned for the first time that his
friends were called upon to pay such
polioe charges, happened in connection
with ildward Nil's recent visits to Earl
Cadogan at Culford Hall, and Lord
Iveagh at Elveden Hall in West Suffolk.
A police officer who had been new to
the district and ignorant of the meth
ods* "by which the expenses of the royal
protection were to be realized, sent to
the local municipal body a bill for $35.
This was brought to the notice of his
Majesty, and the King was so indig
nant that a private visit of his should
cost the taxpayers anything that he im
mediately ordered a check for *he
amount to be sent to the police officer

this aulte just assesment. Mr. Gastrell
razed the building to the ground. A

To Americans in London who dance
it always has been a source of surprise
that although ; the . Cakewalk came," was

the various other melodies to which

Victor Henry Bowring, Is a young
society man of a family well knokn in
fashionable circles and besides a town
house In Eatpn Square he has a coun
try place : near Brighton, England's
most fashionable watering place. His

Trade, is. a former Member of Parlia

cles.
- R. W. Hanbury, Mrs. Bowring-Han
bury's first husband, was president of
the British Board of Agriculture and
Immensely wealthy. He left all his
property to his wife absolutely, so it
is possible that she had other reasons
than mere independence of spirit for
insisting, as he is said to have done,
that his successor should take - his
name. One of these may have been
that as "Mrs. Hanbury" this regal
looking woman has been for several
years a prominent figure in London
social life.
.GAVE NEW HUSBAND A TITLE.
'London society was set all agog by
the action of the fate R. W. Hanbury's
handsome widow in persuading Victor
Bowringâ to- whom she was married
the other dayâ to add the name of i her
former lord to his own. He now is
known as Victor Bowring-Hanbury.
and this is said to be a unique instance
of a first husband's name being added
to that of the second.. Several men
marrying heiresses have, however, hy
phenated the lady's name to their" own,
and sometimes the husband's name has
disappeared altogether, as in the case
of Mr. Burdett-Coutts.
The perfidy of his son, who afterward
run away In a fit of remorse, broke
poor Samuel Ireland's heart and he did
not live long. The old chair at his
death became the property of a well
known club, known as the "Ancient and
Honorable Lumber Troop," a sort of
literary and powerfuj political club, to
which Samuel Ireland himself belonged.
This club, which existed for two or
three centuries, was said to have been
originally formed from one of the
trained bands raised at the time of the
attempted raid by the Spanish Armada,
In Queen Anne's time, her consort.
Prince George of Denmark, was a
"Lumber Trooper," and later on, Ho
garth was a member and painted their
escutcheon of arms, which long after
hung In their troop-hall. Its aims
were chiefly political and it was a
recognized matter that any candidate
for the City of London aspiring to suc
cess should become a "trooper" and
be admitted by their colonel. Their
anthem commencing "We are full ten
thousand boys" was probably not far
from the truth, for even in 1838 their
numbers were credibly estimated at
8000 to 9000 members. Their troop-hall
was what was afterward known as Dr.
Johnson's Tavern, In Holt Court, Fleet
street, London. But with the disuse
ot-the punch bowl came the end of the
days of the "Lumber Troop," and in
1859 the properties and arms of the
troop, including royal and celebrated
autographs, furniture, paintings, etc.,
was* put up' for sale by auction at
Messrs. Price & Clark's rooms in Chan
cery lane/ London.

Glastonbury chair, which belonged to
Shakespeare and called the 'Abbot's
chair.' Full particulars of this lot to
be obtained at the offices of the auc

The chair was sold to a Mr. Joseph
Drew of Weymouth> and was plater
on purchased by Lieutenant Colonel

"Your relatives," I beganâ
"I know, and there are more," she
laughed. "I have an uncle a famous

Miss de Felippe. showed me then pho
tographs of another brother-in-law, an
eminent barrister; of two charming
young English ' girls, Phillips' sisters,
and at last of the Canon, a head fine
and venerable.
"Oh, farcical," she exclaimed. *"The
gods behaved like mortals, the mortals
like immortals, and the whole thing
was utterly without dignity or illusion.
I wrote to. Stephen about it." â¢.
"Mr. Phillips' gods of the prologue
are rather farcical," I ventured. . ;
"It was all that way," Miss de Fe
lippe protested. "No, . I'm 'forgetting
Miss Coghlan's Calypso. That was
splendid./ I wonder if she would think
me impertinent if I would tell her soâ
she comes here this week?"", -
"I think not," I decided. 'x V
"How was It?"
"Most of it," I said, "all the plays."
"Have you read the smaller poems?
I like so much 'The Wife'â strange how
a man can feel, know such things."
"Strange how a man could paint
Malatesta's sister," I added.
"I saw his 'Ulysses' in New Yorkâ"
"Stephen" Mrs. Phillips delighted to
talk of. "Stephen is a great 'leo' in
London," she eald. "I think he should
be the poet laureate.. And he is only 38
or 39. . You have read his work?"

shrugged dolefully again her expressive
little shoulders.
"But you were a Santuzza with Mas
cagni," I reminded.
"Yes, until we met our Waterloo in
Chicago," she laughed.
"How. was that? We were so curious
here about it." v . *
"Too much Madame Mascagni," Miss
de Felippe nodded wisely.
"Ah!"
"Madame was always in the box of
fice, everywhere, ordering, arranging.
She would insist on taking away Mas
cagni's share even before the money
was countedâ what there was of it.
And the season was, oh frightfully
badly managed. Judgments, arrests
every night. In Chicago they had to
lock up the tenor and myself In a back
room for fear they might arrest* us and
prevent the ' performance. They, Mr.
Heard, that Is, who took us there,
served me, little me, with a writ for
$25,000 for leaving Chicago without per-:
mission! And the Italian Consul had
had to send us all back to New York!
The business was excellent in Chicago,
too, crowded houses and great success.
But the management! Then there were
other people besides the company who
know what Madame Mascagni's 'porco
Americano' meant!"
â¢ As to the Mascagni company, of
which sovmuch has been said. Miss de
Felippe said that there .was" an ex
cellent , tenor in ScheyazzI, and a
Santuzza that overshadowed Calve's
in Capelll's. She gave a very acute and
apt defense Cot her opinion. Her â¢ own
position in the company, in her own
modest words, was- "general utility "
person."
"You were with James Powers later?".
I suggested, then. ; = ,,. .
"In the 'Princess of Kensington,'"
she added.! "Oh:dear, ; but I must tell
you one of -the: criticismsâ the critics'
"were very kind to me.JThls one wasn't,
butâ it was funny. He said : ' 'Miss , de
Felippe has a charming voice, and so
on, and acts very : well, but- 1 â but she
might be Jimmy Â¦ Powers' sister,' and
they'll have to fight itout between 'em.'
He's very, ugly, you know." .
"It's, my' nose," she .decided, cheer
fully, as I came away.- , . v
"And Stephen Phillips," I suggested
gently, after a pause, thinking ' that
now I understood the sad light that
sometimes shadows Miss de Felippe's
beautiful eyes. And they are beauti-
It was a very patient, sober, sweet
little face the small soubrette turned
to me as she told me then that she was
the widow of Ttobert Francis Phillips,
artist and brother of Stephen Phillips,
the poet, and son of the Canon of
Peterborough Cathedral. They lived in
New York for three years, Phillips
painting and illustrating for Scrib
ner's, McClure's, the Herald and other
papers, Mrs." Phillips singing in con
cert â only, though, on condition that
she spend the money so earned entire
ly on herself; posing for her husband
and living happily with him the life of
Upper Bohemia. It came to an end onts
day, when the brave young husband
fell ill, and three days afterward died.
"I try very hard not to remember too
much," the little lady ended.
Miss de Felippe laughed and tripped
into another room to bring evidence.
"It is there in black and white," she
said, and put into my hands a book
containing programmes and the like.
And there it was, "Pletro Mascagni, di
rector; Santuzza; Dora de Felippe;
at the Auditorium, Chicago, December
20, 1302."
"I'm Just a pocket Santuzza," she
laughed.
But there was something besides the
Mascagni programmeâ something that
made me look up with a question.
Then MIes de Felippe blushed, and
Miss de Felippe laughed, and Miss de
Kellppe sighed as she said: "I did not
Such a little butterfly of a thing she
looks, too! Think of her mischievous
baby Bronislava of the week's "Beg
gar Student" in' the connection. Nor
should I give Miss de Felippe Â¦ more
than twenty-four or twenty-five years
of experience off the stage. It was then
that I said: "But I cannot make you
into a Santuzza!" and then that I dis
covered the Phillips connection.
Certainly papa seems to have done
a good deal. In the book talk j that
followed the soubrette avowed a strong
liking for Schopenhauer, discussed
Kant and Hegel, and decided that
Shakespeare is sometimes "more
Shakespeare in German. than he is in
English." She confessed to a weak
ness for Lombroso, Montegazza and
other psycho-physiologists of the Ital
ian school, owning that she had read
them In French, as she did not read
fluently in Italian. French literature
we glanced at, Flaubert and De Mau
passant of the moderns, Moliere and
Racine of the classics, deciding inci
dentally that French is the only lan
guage in which those things that should
not be said, or that .we have decided
should not be said, may be politely
Baid. Of the French translations cf
Sir Walter Scott's novels .Miss de Fe
lippe believes ,ihat they "necessarily

simple grandeur, the Saxon â in short,

she has read ten times, for the Eng

lived with and loved much good liter

Probably the only statue of the late
Sol Smith Russell in existence is owned
by George L. Baker of Portland. Or.
The statue was given to Manager Bak
er by the late comedian, and ever since
the manager has retained it as a mas
cot. So far as known there were but
two of these statues made. The sculp
tor was an ardent admirer of Mr. Rus
sell living in San Francisco. One day
while Mr. Russell was filling a date
at Portland an immense barrel was
delivered at the stage door, and upon
being opened it was found to contain one
complete statue and the fragments of
the second. That was the first time
that the comedian saw his counterfeit,
and realizing that it would be useless
to carry the ornament around the coun
try with -him he gave the statue to
Mr. Baker. The figure, which repre
sents Mr. Russell as the poor relation,
has been a mascot to Mr. Baker ever

Here is the Schunrann-Heink pro
gramme for this afternoon at the Tiv
oli. It is useless to advise going if
you are" without a ticket, as the house
was sold out days ago. Let those re
joice who have this last opportunity
to hear the most human, .the most
gloriously voiced singer of them all.
And here is the programme that we
shall hear:
vocabulary, its cameo-like enunciation,
of the kind made only in France. It Im
pelled me to tell her that the perfection
of her English was what made the in
experienced doubt her French origin.
I also asked how she had obtained it.
"My sister and I had an English
governess when we were very small,"
Miss de Felippe explained; "then we
traveled a great deal. We came to
America many times before I came to
live here. Papa came first on business
connected with the Panama canal with
the corps of De Lesseps."
"Aha!" I thought. I said: "Then
papa is not an actor?"
"Pardtm!" The little lady with su
perb politeness here choked down a
piggle. "Papa! Oh, no! This is papa,"
fche ran, with the blrdlike little trip
she has on the stageâ to match her
birdie treble â to the mantelpiece. She
returned with a distinguished looking
centleman of 44 or thereabouts.
"Doesn't he look young?" she rippled.
"I'm tremendously proud of papa."
"And papa is as proud of his daugh
ter?" .'-;.
The small soubrette returned with
a tiny moue: "Oh, no! Why should
he be? He says," Bhe laughed, "he
wunficif how he > ever came to have
such a pair of mediocrities as myself
and my sister in the family."
"Oh, he does!" I returned. "And
what is papa?"
It seems that papa is a writer of
distinction, largely Journalistic, but
otherwise distinguished. As Miss de
Felippe kept the secret of the family
name I can only apologize for the im
politeness of my form of eddress. It
nppears also that papa had literary
views for his offspring. His daughter's
account of his system or education
v i'Uld at least point that way.
They are the kind of hands made only
in France. So, for the matter of that,
is mademoiselle's English, with its deli
cately precise pronunciation, Its fluent
But don't say that I told you this,
and the more that I hope to tell you
cf the same sort. I think Miss do
Felippe would prefer to stand on her
own charming little feet. She may
like you to know, I don't know, but
I'm sure she would rather that you
oid not know that she liked you to
know! The thing came up in one of
those confidences, sudden and strange,
that often arise between the hour-old
acquaintances of an interview. Nor
*o strange are they. The business of
one's life is to make one's self known
to a few people, with a pitiful, hope
3^55=. perverse stammer at best, from
the depths of the soul'te eternal loneli
ness. But one goes on Just the same,
throwing out eager little tendrills of
personality, in the hope that they will
lind somewhere, somehow, a kindred
kaf and perfume. Yet it was accident
â perhaps prettily arranged accident â
that revealed to me Miss de Felippe's
relationship to Stephen Phillips and
the rest. But because she felt that to
riy kind of person the fact was in
teresting. Mips de Felipne told me all
Fbout it, and you I betray confidence
for in the hope that ft will also inter
est you.
I think we began by my asjting the
little lady how to spell her name. It
was in her room at the hotel, still
'"hotelly." She confessed to having felt
o'er lonely yet â Miss de Felippe is only
r. two-months-old Californianâ to make
home of it. She herself, vith' a rose
tucked in her black locks, and in a
brtHtfcfit kfmona, looked like a dainty
Jitt'e butterfly.
'You are French," I stated, rather
than asked, then. The fact is obvious.
"Yes. of course. But is it not strange
that some people say I only pretend to
be French?" Miss de Felippe pouted.
"But why? To be French does not
mike one any more attractive â not" â
with alarmed humility â "that I mean
I Jim attractive. They say also that I
txm Semitic. I am not. I am Just
French.
And "just French" was the little
f-hrug that accompanied the words.
"I gave you a Paris Conservatoire
education," I said. "You use your
hands like their students â very like
Mme. Pilar-Morin. for example.
'"So. no," said Miss de Felippe. "I
have never studied at the Conserva
toire, nor"â she added wittilyâ "with
Madame Marchesi."
"Well, everybody else has," I con
soled. â¢
"I am glad you think I resemble
Pilar-Morin in any way," the little
lady reverted. "I have seen, many
times, her 'Madame Butterfly.' It ,is
very beautiful, thoroughly artistic"
"But you, also, are a Paris product,
turely?" I persist.
"Madame Viardot-Garcia taught me
pinging and Monsieur Bevignon stage
deportment," the little lady confirmed,*
but no one â please â taught me how to
use my hands. I do not know how I
use them. They use themselves, please."
and the round arms and plump hands
came out of the kimona in eloquent
illustration.
I was, however, quite unprepared for
the .fashion and degree of Miss de
Felippe's difference. Imagine un
earthing in the TivoJi soubrette a tiny
philosopher in petticoats, a pocket
femme savante, and if not the daugh
ter of a hundred earls at least the
daughter of a famous French man of
letters, and daughter-in-law of the
Canon of Peterborough Cathedralâ who
fathered Stephen Phillips, who should
be. as he Is not, poet laureate of Eng
land.
Santuzza with Mascagni, the Prln
ross of Kensington with "Jimmy"
rowers, the sprightly Arabella of the
Tivoli's "Mr. Pickwick," etc., etc., Miss
l>ora do Felippe certainly promised
variety. Her face, the kitten face â I
had watched the "piquant triangle"
â¢with its flashes of sheer* beauty, its
delicate, vivacious ugliness, through
"Mr. Pickwick"â insured the something
different.

WITH THE PLAYERS
AND THE MUSIC FOLKLONDON, April ( 16.â The farthing,
which the judgeshave been making
use i of frequently of late in awarding
damages to litigants, has proved in one
case a useful coin. A > West Bromwich
widow iccently obtained "a farthing in
a breach of promise action she had
brought against a faithless lover. She
put it in the 'window of her tobacco
shop with a , printed -warning to trust
ing" women to beware of mizpah ringa
and inviting men to come and .buy
breach of promise cigars and widow's
mite cigars. The result was such a
big business that the police had to
stand by to keep the pavement "clear,
while nineteen men, mostly widowers,
came and offered themselves in ' mar
riage.

This is a. delightful prospect from a
commercial point of view, and the.
scheme in addition would have the
great advantage of enabling Londoners
to use the river as a means of rapid
transit, even as the Parisians use the
Seine. It is the tides in the Thames
that render steamboat services un
profitable, and the creation of a tide
less river would mean virtually a new
means of intercommunication.
LONDON. April IS.â While the
scheme is on foot for turning the* river
Thames at London into a lake by lock
ing the tide out at Gravesend, it has
not advanced beyond the stage of in
quiry, and it already Is evident the
proposal is favorably regarded.
One strong argument in favor of the
scheme is the impossibility of dredging
the river to a sufficient depth over the
Thames tunnel. At present the mud at
the top of this tunnel forms a barrier
to deep draft vessels at low water., and
the courts refuse to permit the mud
to be removed, lest the tunnel should
suffer. If, however, the Thames were
locked at Gravesend the water always
could be kept at sufficient depth . to
allow large ships to get right up" to
London bridge. .
Plan Is Feasible and Would Allow
Proper Dredging of the
Channel.

Unhappy lies. the head that hath no
country house to shelter it. True it is
that many a good and eminently re
j^pcctiible citizen gives dally thanks for
a town house â just a lone, single, soli
tary abiding place in town â but that
is not the fellow who constitutes the
smart tet, so away with him.
The necessity for a country home in
California is of recent origin. We bor
rowed the praiseworthy custom from
the effete East, where no one. abso
lutely no one with any social preten
sions gets on withcut a hut up the
Hudson, or a bungalow in the Adiron
dacks, or a bonny cottage at Newport,
the latter the elysium of social su
premacy. #
And while these rural possessions
have come to be a stepping stone to
social eminence, they carry with them
a fire influence for mental, moral and
physical betterment. Away among the
hills, by the side of the sea. or In the
depths of a forest the mind grows, and
rrows the way it -shouldâ no dwarfing,
no pettiness, no limitations. Therefore
are we glad that the East, which bor
rowed the custom from England, has
bestowed the beneficent custom upon
us.
And where in all the world is a coun
try home more perfectly a country
home than In our own new Italy?
And the gods be thanked that Cali
fornia ns are awakening to a fact that
the Spaniard, the case-loving ancestor
of our State, discovered a century since,
that oat of door sleeping is the leading
luxury of the rural home and ours by
right divine. Therefore are the new
summer hemes growing up with ver
nnda? ard patios, those luxuriant gar
dens betwixt walls/ where the sun
shines and the flowers bloom for every
room la the dwelling. This is the typi
cal <-ountry home of Californiaâ and
may we see more of it.

the John Brices at Napa, the McKitt

the way. have taken the Tubbs place
at San Mateo. but will later occupy the
Joe Tobin home. And as to San Rafael
and its surrounding burgs, there isn't
a smokeless chimney In the county
now.
Much gaycty is propheAed for San
Rafael this summer, especially a*r
"Meadowlands," where, by the way, a
charming little party took place last
week, with Miss Helen de Young as
hostess. Among her guests were: Celia

Gibson Bowles, one of the special
commissioners who visited the rock and
reported adversely on the position of
the new docks, said:
"In any peace maneuvers a fortress
will always win against a fleet- So
much is allowed for the assumed
strength of a fortress that ' the fleet
usually comes off second best in tests."
Bowles does not pose as a naval ex
pert, but he attaches little importance
to the decisions of umpires.
On his return next month Major Gen
eral F. G. Slade, who has watched the
maneuvers on behalf of the War Office,
will present some valuable evidence to
the army council; but without waiting
for this testimony the authorities seem
anxious to strengthen the defenses of
the rock, especially as regards the
heavy guns, for which Â£24,000 has been
voted. :
LONDON, April 16.â Official inquiries
of an exhaustive character are being
made as to the safety of Gibraltar.
The impotency of the fortress at Port
Arthur has reopened the question ot
the rock's invulnerability, and the re
cent maneuvers in Gibraltar Bay, al
though officially declared to have ended
ii favor of the fortress, have revealed
â¢_,reat weaknesses.
Results at Port Arthur Lead to Inves
tigation and Flaws Are Found

ST. PETERSBURG. April 16.â The
claim of Vice Admiral Togo, Command
er-in-chief of the. Japanesb squadron,
that he sank mines off Port Arthur at
midnight on Tuesday,, has elicited an
authoritative statement that not a sin
gle Japanese torpedo boat approached
the entrance Vto> Port Arthur at that
time. The Informant of the Associated
Press is In a position to have access to
all official Â¦ reports, but he admits he
cannot explain the Petropavlovsk ex
plosion. An admiral haB given a ver
pion of the affair confirming that of
Vice Admiral Togo. He declares that
Japanese torpedo boats came up the
previous evening and laid mines along
the shore south of the entrance to the
harbor. He claims that the torpedo
boats were seen to make oft in a dif-.
ferent direction from that in which
they came. The Russian flagship, he
says, drew out from the line as the
squadron re-entered the harbor, thus
getting among the Japanese mines.
The theory that the disaster to the
Petropavlovek was caused by a subma
rine boat, which has been scouted by
the admiralty/ is revived by a state
ment "published "in the Xovi Krai on
March 24 that a sentry cutter sighted
in the roadstead what looked like a
submarine vessel. seven miles off shore.
The launches from a torpedo boat were
sent out to investigate, but found no
trace of the vessel.

DELEGATES FROM SANTA
CRUZ ARE UNPLEDGED
The decision sustains a demurrer
filed by Bryan's counsel and practi
cally denies the application as far as
the Probate Court is concerned.
The matter will now go to the
higher court on appeal.
The claim of the residuary legatees
that Bryan was acting contrary to the
best interests of the estate was based
on the fact that he appealed as an in
dividual and as a trustee from the
decree of the Probate Court, refusing
to incorporate as a part of the will the
sealed letter by â¢which" Bennett ex
pressed a wish that Bryan should have
$50,000. It was . claimed by the
residuary legatees . that j this- appeal
was inconsistent with his duties as
executor of the will and that he is
unnecessarily delaying the settlement
of the estate. '
In the demurrer It was claimed for
Bryan that in seeking to have the
sealed letter incorporated in the will
he is not attacking the will or assum
ing a position of hostility toward it,
but is attempting to remove" the am
biguity of the clause in the will men
tioning the letter. "
Judge Cleaveland finds that "there
is nothing to indicate that it was
Bryan's duty to resign as executor and
thus desert' the trust conferred , upon
him by Mr. Bennett, and it cannot be
the law that his duties as executor
involvfe the waiver of his right to have
his claim as legatee passed .upon by
the court of last resort in this State.
The precise question raised by this ap
plication has, so far as appears from
the cases cited I in the briefs of coun
sel, never been raised, and in the ab
sence of clear, authority* requiring the
removal of an executor under the cir
cumstances of this case, it is, the
opinion of : this court that Bennett's
choice., should not be . thus defeated,
and that the facts alleged do not con
stitute \ sufficient . ground for Mr.
Bryan's removal. The demurrer is
sustained and -Â¦' the application*' dis
missed." , - <
The application was brought by
counsel for Mrs. Bennett, -the widow,
and other residuary, legatees on the
ground that Bryan waa acting con
trary to the interests of the estate.

controversy Platt expressed the opin
ion that time, had passed when the

sistance from others. Teller took
issue with Platt's statement, saying
that within the last : four years
40,000 acres of land had been entered
under the homestead laws and that
more land was being taken under that
law than twenty years ago. Without

After expressing his admiration for
the President as a ranchman, a soldier
and an author, Patterson quoted at
: length from the' writings of the Pres
ident to show his estimate of the pub
lic men of the country, past and pres
ent. Roosevelt had declared that one
third of the New York Legislature of
which he was a member was corrupt;
that both parties in the State were
dominated by corruption; while Civil
j Service Commissioner the President
had condemned a speech of Grosvenor
in opposition to an appropriation for
that service "as either full of ignor
ance or gross misstatements."
The President's writings on former
Presidents was quoted at length by
Patterson, and in many instances
commented on as grossly unjust crit
icism. While referring to the Presi
dent's '"constant talk of war," Patter
son was asked by Cooper of Wisconsin
why it was that the foreign relations
of the United States were so uniformly
cordial under Roosevelt's administra
tion. Patterson replied that when this
was the case the talk of war was in
excusable.

WASHINGTON. April 16. â The rou

The paramount issue in the nejet
campaign will be Theodore Roosevelt,
according to Patterson, who wanted it
understood that in criticizing Theo
dore Roosevelt, the candidate, he w,as
not criticizing Theodore Roosevelt,
President of the United States. Reply
ing to a recent of Grosvenor,
"delivered in silence" (the speech was
inserted under a leave to print), and
giving the record of President Roose
velt on the labor problem, Patterson
referred to the surmises in some quar
ters that this speech emanated from
the White House.

In the nurses' department ._ two
trained nurses are supported by the
Crocker and .Hearst funds. The of
fice of the Associated Charities Is their
headquarters and they .devote â¢ their
whole time to the visiting of such of
the destitute .sick ;as are brought to
their notice through ..the. office. These
nurses are > at: the" call;df the legit
imate charities; of. the 'city or of any
doctor doing work among the poor.
The students' department Is now an
organized branch of the Associated
Charities work and has, through the
pressure of conditions and circum
stances, taken such shape that its
complete organization. during. the year
lffO3 . appears -, imperative.. Its , pur
poses are, first, , in co-operation with
the Boys' and Girls* Aid Society, Hhe
Society for Prevention of Cruelty '.to
Children and the California" Club, to
support probation. officers for the Ju
venile court; second, to maintain -a
traveling agent, with headquarters at
the office of the Associated Charities,
who shall be at the call of the chil
dren's homes of 'Â¦'â¢ the* : vicinity Â¦ and
wriose .duty it shall" be to keep In
touch with the children placed; out in
homes by these \ institutions and â¢â¢ to
find suitable homes ; for. such .other
children' as 'these Institutions may de
sire to place out; third, to establish
an investigating agency, which . shall
offer its services -to the "children's in
stitutions for the investigation of their
applicants for admission." ; '
The legislative department was es
tablished in 1902. and is In charge of
a special committee of the central
council. Its object is to familiarize
itself with the charitable situation in
California, so as to be able to formu
late and secure the passage of needed
legislation in this field and to oppose
the passage of vicious measures. -
Previous to the last session of the
Legislature this legislative committee
prepared a bill creating a State Board
( of Charities. and Corrections; another
making possible the probation of
criminals where the court finds;. the
circumstances to* justify such action
and, in co-operation with the Califor
nia Club, a bill for a juvenile courtf,
All these were introduced. into rne
Legislature, a- vigorous . campaign | was
conducted under the auspices of the
committee, a representative being kept
at the capital during the entire term
and delegations from the committee
making frequent visits in % the inter
ests ' of this ' legislation. ' As a result
all the bills were successfully passed
and were signed by the Governor.
NURSES' DEPARTMENT.
For the use of those , engaged in
charitable work the Associated Chari
ties keeps a record of all "cases apply
ing'to its office or rep'orted\by any co
operating society. This record now
comprises the history of some 2500
c&es. Its constant " use by charity
workers prevents duplication and
makes it possible to discriminate be
tween the chronic pauper and those
in temporary need. . ,<â¢
Wherever possible some plan is for
mulated whereby the person or fam
ily may be restored to a position of in
dependence. In the carrying out of
this plan the Associated Charities calls
into 'service whatever agencies the
special neeji may require. Thus,
through its position as a center of
co-operation, the Associated \ Charities
is able to .bring to the assistance of
any particular the charitable re
sources of the community.
To the application and investigation
bureau societies and individuals may
send those .who ask them for assist
ance. The bureau commands the ser
vices of experienced agents, who de
vote their time to making a careful
study V)f the circumstances of each
person' referred to them in order to
determine, first, whether assistance of
any sort; is really needed, and, second,
if such assistance is needed, how it
can be" most effectively given.
In view of the fact that great in
terest was* aroused by the State con
ference of charities held in this city
Jast February, "it has" been decided by
the' Associated Charities to hold a sup
plemental meeting. ' This - extra con
ference will take place at the Young
Men's Christian Association building,
corner of Ellis and Mason streets, on
the evening of April' 21.
â¢ Katherihe Felton, general secretary
of the Associated Charities, will give'
an outline of the work done in the
last two years. Mrs. John F. Merrill
will explain all about the work of the
children's. , department. Fairfax , H.
Whelan will' speak ,of the juvenile
court.. Andrew Davis, chairman .of
the charities indorsement committee,
will tell about the civic function of the
Associated Charities.
The work of the organization is di
vided into the following departments:
Indorsement committee, application
and investigation bureau, registration
bureau) legislation, training school for
nurses and children's department.
The indorsement committee was or
ganized by the Merchants' Association
and the Associated Charities to pro
tect the community from fraudulent
and inefficient charities. It is the
function of. this committee to investi
gate all organizations applying to it
for indorsement and to issue its of
ficial card to such as are doing hon
est and efficient work. The office force
of the Associated Charities is the in
vestigating agency for this committee,
and the Associated Charities has as
sumed all expenses incident to this
department of work.
. APPLICATIOX BUREAU.
The Judge' fixed the "Value of the es
tate at J3.040.1S7 75, and' ordered $126,000
reserved to meet any litigation, that
amount, or the balance remaining after
paying any legitimate claims, to be
distributed to the heirs. * .\
In the estate of Mrs. Caroline D. Fair
a partial distribution was ordered to
Mrs. Joseph D. Harvey. Mrs. Fair had
bequeathed to her a sable cape, a dia
mond fleur-de-lis and. a diamond sun
burst. The cape had been lost or stolen
in a fur store In Paris, and $942 had
been paid in lieu thereof by the" fur
riers. Mrs. Harvey was allowed this
sum and also the fleur-de-lis and the
sunburst, which were in the possession
of the administrator. The final distri
bution of Mrs. Fair's estate will be
made in a few days.
Attorneys Lloyd & Heggerty repre
sented the administrator, and Captain
John F. Seymour was also present to
be in readiness if any unexpected ob
jection was made to the final distribu
tion. '
SUM IS RESERVED.
Charles S. Neal testified that he had
charge for years of the estate of the
late James L. Fair fcnd.knew the. value
of the properties. The appraised value
of 'the late Charles L. Fair's estate at
the time of his death,- on August 14,
1902, was $3,0*40,187 75. Since that time
the value of the realty had increased,
but there had been a decrease in the
value of the personality. Mrs. Hannah
Nelson, Mrs. Fair's mother, had been
paid $125,000 in settlement of her claim
against the estate. '
Mrs. Margaret Melbourne testified
that she had been Mrs. Fair's maid
for seven years prior to her death. She
saw Mr. and Mrs. Fair at a hotel in
Trouville, France, shortly before they
met with the accident that caused their
death. She saw them leave In an auto
mobile to go to Paris to the Hotel Rltz,
where they intended to stop for a day
and then return to Trouville. She heard
of their death at Passy sur Eure and
hurried there In an automobile, .where
she saw their dead bodies In the Berson
chateau. She detailed what she learned
about '.the i accident and their deaths.
The bodies were removed from the
Berson ' chateau"- to the ' Church of the
Madel&ine, In' Paris. No child was
born of the marriage to her knowledge.
The final distribution in the estate of
the late Charles L. Fair was, made yes
terday by Judge Cook, and all rumors
ab'out contests on behalf of his wife's
relatives and a mysterious heir were
proved to have been groundless. The
only opposition was made by the at
torney for Nicholas Rooney, who claims
$75,000 from the estate of the late
James G. Fair, and an attorney for an
other claimant against that' estate to
the extent of $1040." Their opposition
was set aside by the fact that an
amount was reserved from Charles L.
Fair's estate to cover these amounts
and other claims that are in litigation.
Hermann Oelrichs, the administrator
Of Charles L. : Fair estate, was called
and testified as to the sale of bonds
and other securities to meet necessary
expenses and claims amounting to
$190,000. Several suits were pending
against the late James G. Fair's es
tate, he said, and it would be ; neces
sary to reserve an amount to carry on
the litigation and â¢ also to pay taxes.
All claims against Charles L. Fair's
estate had been paid, he said. The de
ceased left no direct heir, and his heirs
were bis two surviving sisters, Mrs.
Oelrichs and Mrs. Virginia Vanderbilt.
The deceased had survived his wife.

Â«' The distracting: headaches from which'
so many women suffer make life a daily
purgatory. If men suffered with. heao-
acho as women -do, - business .would be
almost at a standstill, j ' Does not the fact
that women only suffer from these severe
headaches suggest that there must be a.
womanly cause for them ?
When the womanly organism, is dis-
eased, headache, backache, nervousness
and sleeplessness are consequences which
are sure to follow. ' Â¦

The outflow of gold to Paris has
been more than offset by the inflow
of Japanese gold to San Francisco.
The movment to Europe is expected
extend a good deal further. The
present heavy contraction In the value
of cotton and grain exports and the
future requirements for the Panama
canal payments are to be considered
in the outcome. Crop prospects have
a growing influence and the condition
of the winter wheat crop is not re
garded as satisfactory. A cheering ef
fect is caused by the increased pro
duction of iron, while the stocks on
hand continue to decline, but the
failure of United States Steel to re
spond modifies these effects. Rail
roads report traffic running at a lower
average than last year, but traflic of
ficials speak hopefully of the future
prospects.

stocks which gave tone to the previous
market and which stimulated specula
tion by keeping alive conjecture as to
their origin and causes. The most con
spicuous of such movements was that
in Union Pacific The general public
has obtained no satisfactory clew to
the recent enormous accumulation of
that stock, and insiders profess to be
equally in the dark. The recent ad
vance In the stock market has hinged
almost entirely upon the Union Pacific
movement, and the halt in that move
ment this week has had a dominant
sympathetic effect on the whole mar
ket. Suspicion of its purely speculative
origin was aroused by the action of the
Ftock in face of the supposition late
Monday that the Attorney General had
intervened in the suit at St. Paul to
oppose the demand of the Union Pacific
Interests to secure the return of the
Northern Pacific stock entered in the
Northern Securities merger. .
A better understanding of the Gov
ernment's step changed this impres
sion, but not the belief that the ac
cumulation of Union Pacific was based
to-, the chance of winning the contest
for control of Northern Pacific Pub
lic utterances by President Hill of the
Great Northern have confirmed the
belief that the Union Pacific has en
tered upon a determined contest for
control of the Northern Pacific and of
the Burlington. It is perceived that
other legal steps lie open to continue
the contest to this end, even In the
event of the throwing out of court
of the petition at St. Paul. The un
certainty which has been kept hanging,
over, the market a long time by such
a procedure, it is feared, would re
new the conditions preceding the deci
sion by the Supreme Court In the
Northern Securities case itself. This
prospect has chilled speculative en

important Btep took toward obligatory

SAN RAFAEL. April 16.â A North
Shore passenger train had a narrow
escape from a serious wreck about
noon to-day. The train leaving Sausa
lito at 8:30 o'clock for Cazadero was
derailed when about three miles above
San Anselmo Junction. The train was
going at a very low rate of speed or
else the wreck would have been a 'bad
one. There were four cars to the
train and Conductor Murray was In
charge. ' When about half way -. up
Whites Hill a brakebeam and brake
shoe on the forward coacli broke arid
dropped on the rail, thus derailing
turte oars. Owing to the cut, the cars
did not turn over and no one was in
jured. A wrecking train soon arrived
from Sausallto and the train was sent
up-country after Vivo hours* delay.

NEW YORK, April 16.â The Finan
cier says: The notable feature of the
New^York Associated Banks last week
was a further expansion in loans and
new high records for cafsh and for pub
lic , deposits. . The loan item was in
creased by $4,721,100, making $20,547,000
in the last fortnight,' $134,6S3,600 since
the beginning of/the year and $53,045,
000 compared with, the end of February.
The increase this week, as was the case
in previous weeks, j was mostly due to
syndicate and corporation borrowings.
The cash gain reported by the banks
was ?7,2S9.600, .which amount was $2.
200.000 less; than' the gain as estimated
upon the basis of the traceable move
ments of money during the week. De
posits \vefe increased $11,605,600 and the
required reserve was thereby augment
ed* $2,901,400, deducting which from the
gain In cash -left $4,388,20.0 as the in
crease Jn surplus reserve to $27,304,600.
Computed, upon the basis of deposits,
less those of $5bM9i:700 pubiic funds, the
5iirplus;-is $41,352,525. The statement
showed a good proof, the sum of in
crease in 'loans and the gain; in cash
being only $405,100 greater than, the in
crease in loans. Alt may be noted that'
the cash gain was made up of $5,644,600
specie 'and $1,645,000 legal tender. This
carries;both the specie and the total
cash reserve to new high records^ The
public deposits also show the maximum
since they began to be separately re
ported in .-: the bank statement. Cir
culation 1 wds increased by' $3u8,600. The
daily clearings averaged $190,000,000, or
$2,000,000 Jess than those of the pre
vious week. Loans of individual banks
in the -association show net gains ol
$2,S00 ; 000 by six institutions. â¢ '/

Brigade, regimental and independent
battalion commanders are advised to
have at least two practice marches and
bivouacs each year by company, regi
ment or brigade, and at such time to
give instructions in extended orders
on varied ground, estimating distances,
marching in the order prescribed; ad
vance and rear formations and in
pitching and striking tents: But" offi
cers are considering how they will ac
complish this where the units are not
concentrated, as the brigade, regimen
tal and independent battalion com
manders are not provided with funds
for transportation.
The four batteriesâ Company A, Oak
land, and Company D, San Rafael, of
the Fifth Infantryâ or more properly
a detail of the best shooters from each
unit, had an experimental shoot at
the range of Company D, near San
Rafael, last Sunday, with satisfactory
results. It was the first time that
members of the guard used the Krag-
Jorgensen in rifle practice and, . all
things being considered, . the scores
were gooÂ«l. It took the men a little
time to become accustomed to the new
arm and understand the pulling of the
trigger, and in the outset some of the
men, who with Springfields never miss
ed the bullseye, were unable â¢ to find
the targets, but, -acquiring more .fa
miliarity, they made creditable scores.
This experiment was in a great mea
sure the result of the efforts of Major
Smith of the Fifth Infantry and Cap
tain Grattan of the artillery to bring
target practice to the fore. .The shoot
ing, at 300 and 500 yards, was under the
direction of Lieutenant . S. O. Beasley
as range officer, and the 1 manner 'in
which he discharged his duties proved
him to be eminently qualified for the
position. ' * .
The following were the scores at the
two distances:

A question has arisen as to how the
latter part of the orders can be car
ried out. In a city like San Francisco
there will be no difficulty in getting
the men together, but outside of the
city, where the companies of the bat
talions are separated by many miles,
the battalion commanders are at a
loss to know how to get the units of
their respective commands together, in
view of the fact that in the order no.
provision is made for transportation.
Regimental and independent battal
ion commanders have, been instructed
to organize officers' and non-commis
sioned officers' schools and to hold ses
sions at least once every quarter.
Where a regiment is not concentrated
its commander is to organize such
schools as he shall find most practi
cable, but in such manner as to give
all officers and non-commissioned offi
cers complete instruction. At' such
schools particular instruction is to be
given in military courtesy, keeping of
records, care, of property,- rendering re
ports and the forms of military cor
respondence. When practicable a sur
geon "is to be in attendance to give
instructions in first" aid/ "sanitation of
armories and camps and "proper cloth
ing for and care of the* person during
a march or campaign:
PRACTICE MARCHES.
NO TRAVELING EXPENSES.
The orders also provide that the regi
mental commanders shall require their
field officers to visit the companies in
their respective, commands at least
once each quarter for purposes of in
spection and instruction; also that
commanders of battalions, independent
or serving in regiments, shall hold bat
talion drills at least once every quar
ter and that at such drills company
commanders be given opportunity to
drill the battalion.
Orders have been issued from divi
sion headquarters of the , National
Guard of California that refer to a mat
ter that has been in the past more
honored in the breach than in the ob
servance. Brigade commanders are
supposed either personally or by staff
officer to visit each unit of their re
spective commands at its home sta
tion at least once m each calendar
year, and at each such visit examine
and note carefully its general condi
tion and efficiency as a military or
ganization, condition of its property
and care given to it, conditon of its
records, noting their completeness and
whether they are kept in conformity
with regulations and orders, the thor
oushne: 3 of instruction in the drill reg
ulations and the compliance with or
ders as to the drill and instructions of
and by officers and non-commissioned
officers.
In San Diego an urgent request was

The City Council of Los Angeles has

A library club has recently been or
ganized by the staff of the Stanford
University Library. Its object is to
discuss topics relating to library work
and to promote social feeling between
the different departments of the insti

in the club, which proposes to hold
monthly meetings.
For the construction of the Wood
land Carnegie building the bid of W.
H. Curson, offering to do the work for
$9628 50. has been accepted by the
library trustees. An intimation being
given through a local paper that any
applicant for the privilege of furnish
ing the cornerstone might be gratified,
Fred Haase promptly responded with
the offer of such a gift. The donation
has been accepted with the thanks of
the library board. The grand master
of. the Grand Lodge of Masons has
been asked to lay the cornerstone of
the building.
The Ebell Society of Oakland is send
ing out traveling libraries to various
communities. One library with eighty
one volumes has been sent to San Le

a drug store foT the use of the public.
The Napa and Sonoma Valleys Con
ference of the Library Association of
California, held at Santa Rosa Satur
day, April 9, -was the first of a new se
ries of library meetings to be conduct
ed at various cities in the State. The
design of these." gatherings is to in
crease the general interest in public li
braries by the discussion of vital topics.
The first paper presented was of a
historical character, by Rev. L. D.
Rathbone, a trustee of the Santa Rosa
library. The growth of this library
was traced from its beginning in 1869
to the present time, when it has re
ceived a $5000 building site from the
citizens, $20,000 for the building from
Andrew Carnegie and $1000 from Nel
son Carr for the steel book stacks. The
blue basalt stone used in the construc
tion of the structure was presented by
J. M. McDonald of San Francisco. Be
sides reviewing the scope and satisfac
tory results of the library influences,
particular stress was laid by the speak
er upon the value of the work per
formed by the librarian, Miss Bertha
Kumli.
E. M. Cox, Superintendent of Schools,
in a paper upon the value of a library
to the community showed the intimate
connection which should exist between
schools and public libraries, the aid af
forded to student life through wider
knowledge of history and literature
and the culture which a library brings
to a community.
The practical topic of what a town
can do for a library was the theme of
Charles S. Greene, librarian of the Oak
land Public Library. It was stated that
in the Ebell Society the Oakland li
brary had found a constant friend. Not
only did this society raise $20,000 for
the library site and $5000 for the chil
dren's room, but when the Teachers"
Club wanted more books the Ebell gave
$50 upon the condition that the library
would give the same amount for such
accessions to its shelves.
State Librarian Gillls closed the dis
cussion with a presentation of the new
work begun by the State Library and
the aims it had in view for the exten
sion of the library interest throughout
California. This conference is regard
ed as one of the most profitable ones
ever held by the library association.

"Fighting Bob" has lately undergone
a great change physically, and is about
ready to retire from active sea duty
when his term expires. His limp is
worse than ever, and the admiral's
constitution, may be said to have been
shattered by his last tour of duty in
the Orient. While the fleet was coaling
recently at Honolulu Evans kept to his
apartments at the hotel.
He will be succeeded by Admiral
Cooper in command of the Asiatic sta
tion this month, and will then return
to New York on the flagship Kentucky
by way of the Mediterranean.
Everywhere^ the United States re
gret will be felt to, learn that Admiral
Robley D. Evans, the commander of
the Asiatic fleet, is but little more than
a shadow of his former robust self. *

Poor Goldsmith's "oddities and ec

Montaigne had an aversion for Fri
day, and while he preferred odd num
bers, he would not sit down to a table
with thirteen people. Friday was al
ways a black day in Byron's calendar,
but Byron believed in omens, dreams,
supernatural appearances, appari
tions, presentiments and all such. He
succumbed before the weakest preju
dices, and afforded proof that even the
strongest intellects have always their
weak side. Voltaire, whom one would
suppose devoid of fear, mocker, of re
ligion and beliefs, was made sick when
hearing rooks cawing in the country.
Hobbes did not believe in God, but
would also walk out in the dewy fields
without stockings or shoes. . ' â¢
he kept a light burning in his bedroom
all night, being afraid, of the dark.
Rousseau was another who was afraid
of the dark, and the approach . of
night brought only terror to him. Be

Romilly would always look under the*
bed. to see if any one was concealed
there. He dreaded to see night come.
Great warriors have been afraid of

When he felt that he needed a little
activfty the great logician, Samuel
Clarke, would leap over tables and
chairs, and it was not infrequent that
the upholsterer had to be called ln to
repair damages. The learned Petavius
would twirl his chair round for five
minutes at the end of every two hours,
finding recreation ln this. Tycho
Brahe diverted himself with polishing
glasses for spectacles. Ex- President
Cleveland would quit talking politics
any time to go fishing, and so It was
with Paley, the author of "Natural
Theology," who was so much given to
angling that he had his portrait paint
ed with rod and line in hand. Louis
XVI, of sad memory, amused himself
locksmithing, while Salvator Rosa
performed In extempore comedies,
taking the character of a mountebank
in the streets of Rome.
Charles II's most ' Innocent amuse
ment consisted in feeding the ducks
in St. James Park and in rearing num
bers of those beautiful' spaniels which
still bear his name. It was difficult
.for Beethoven. to be free from a cold
from the fact that he delighted in
splashing in cold water at all times
of the day, swamping his chamber
until the water oozed through the
flooring to the rooms beneath. He
Spinoza delighted to set spiders
fighting, and would laugh Immoder
ately at beholding their insect war
fare; and Ant!~ny Magliabecuhl, the
famous librarian to the Duke of Tus
cany, took a great interest in the
spiders which thronged his apart
ments, and while sitting among his
mountains of books would caution
visitors "not to hurt my spiders."
Dr. Johnson was so fond of his cats
that he would even go out himself to
buy oysters for them, his servants be
ing too proud to do so. Goethe de
spised dogs, but he kept a tame snake.
Gray expressed the wish" to be al
ways on a sofa reading new novels,
and Fenton, the eminent scholar, died
from sheer Inactivity; he rose late,
and when he had risen sat down to
his books and papers. A woman who
waited upon him in his lodgings said
that he would lie a-bed and be fed
with a spoon. Contrary to this was
the example of Sir Walter Scott, who
wrote all his finest works before
breakfast.
Study the private lives of all truly
great men, both present and past. It
is not difficult to determine that all
of them, to a greater or less degree,
furnished material of the "odd and ec
centric" kind. Cardinal Richelieu
found pleasure and amusement In
Jumping and leaping with boys. Oliver
Cromwell sometimes cast aside his
Puritan gravity and played at blind
man's buff with his daughters and
attendants; Henri Quatre delighted to
go about in disguise with the peas
antry. Cowper occupied a great deal
of his time In making birdcages and
in feeding and caring for his hares.

â¢ If charming young women ln exqui
site gowns can attract. It is safe to
prophesy that there will be a crush at
the first fete of spring, to be given by
the chrysanthemum auxiliary of the
Children's Hospital board on Saturday
next. The Sorosis Club rooms, at 1620
California street, will be the scene of
the brilliant affair, and the public will
be received between the hours of 2 and
6 p. m. The fair young chrysanthe
mums have never given an entertain
ment of this kind, but their dances for
charity ln the past two winters have
been smart affairs, and while they may
lack the years and experience which
readily assure the success of bazaar
giving, they have the advantages of
youth and popularity, which will bring
a stream of friends with loosened
pursestrings for this worthy cause. In
fact, on the occasion of the last hos
pital benefit, at the Palace maple room,
it was the chrysanthemums, bewitch
ingly costumed as Geisha girls, who by
offering their services in the tea room
lent the brightest touch of color and
piquancy to the bazaar. At the coming
fete the score of chrysanthemums will
devote themselves to visitors and pre
side over the booths and refreshment
tables with their most inviting smiles.
In every available place attractive
booths laden with fancy work, candy
and other desirable articles will be ar
ranged to tempt the throng of patrons.
A fish pond will contain no end of sur
prises for eager children, and the
charming chrysanthemum in attend
ance will attract as many society men
as Juveniles.
An excellent musical programme will
be an important feature of the after
noon's enjoyment. Miss Laura Taylor
has charge or the music, and having
many musical interests herself will
procure artist* well worth While.
The proceeds of next Saturday's fete
will be devoted to the chrysanthemum
fund, which provides a free bed from
year to year In the incurable ward of
the hospital. The dire necessity of a
little waif cut off from all hope of
health and success from the beginning
of life stirs a chord of pathos in many
hearts which will respond gladly to the
appeal for financial aid.
The following list comprises^ the
chrysanthemum' auxiliary, most of
whom are Eelllng tickets and are other
wise working for the success of the
coming fete: -Miss Norma Castle, Mrs.
Jack Chase, Miss Ruth Gedney/ Miss
Mabel Hogg, Mrs. Edward Hume, Mrs.
Richard Hovey, Miss Hovey, Mrs.

â¢ Poor memory means an Ill-nourished
brain. The proper food to help and
ru/urlsh the brain will thus help the
memory, as ic the following case:
"I have not known what It is to en-
joy rÂ«Â»al cood health, not having seen
b v.oll day in over twenty years and
t&king medicine most of the time until
about a year ago.
"At that time I was suffering greatly
Irom nervous prostration and general
debility, the result of severa.1 severe
Illnesses from which I never expected
to fully recover.
"My memory was also so poor that
it caused me much chagrin at times.
"I had often heard how Grape-Nuts
had helped other people's memory and
that it was a brain food. Finally I was
put on Grape-Nuta for my meals.
"I was po pleasing to the taste I
erjoyed eating it, and after a time I
saw such en Improvement ln my health
generally that I gave up medicine alto-
gether. Am not even using laxatives
now, that I had been unable to do
without for years. Grape-Nuts helped
my nerves, grave me strength, increased
my weight ten pounds and I can now
work and walk better and enjoy life
as 1. never expected to again.
"When my friends remark how well
I look and act I tell them It is all' due
to Grape-Nuts. My doctor never sees
me but he smiles with genuine pleas-
ure at my improved condition, for he
if an old friend and would like to see
me perfectly well, knowing how long
and hcrw much I have suffered." Name

to welcome you to the annual reunion
breakfast of the Alumnae Association.
Tour presence here Is indicative of the
interest in the alumnae, and what
seemed only a vague possibility when
planned by the board of directors has
evolved into a splendid reality and will
become, I trust, a permanent feature
of our reunions. -
"I take great pleasure in introduc

Miss Maud Dalton attained her
birthday last Friday, and to clothe
her celebration of the event with
proper eclat she enlisted the aid of
Miss yiolet Wood,: than whom there is
not a" more competent planner and
director of attractive functions among
the "entire smart set of Barbary Coast
society. The- two ladies put their
heads together r and after considering
and rejecting a number of novel ideas
finally decided upon the time-honored
dance and supper as the form, of en
tertainment that would be" most likely
to flnd favor~with the greatest num
ber of their friends. But as time did
not allow . of /notification of these
friends by letter. Miss Dalton and Mis3
Wood salliNd Torth afoot to deliver the
invitations verbally. The task necessi
tated their * visiting 'several places
wherein alcoholic. stimulants .were dis
pensed, and to"; that fact; may be at
tributed the failure of the proposed
birthday party to eventuate. Miss
Dalton and Miss Wood were arrested
for disorderly conduct Â¦ on Pacific
street, their specific offense being the
jostling of all persons, irrespective of
sex, who attempted: to pass them on
the sidewalk. They had cast \ into the
gutter quite a number of- the most
prominent residents of the district ere
thVpolicemah 'stopped their fun.
"Won't you please let my papa go
mamma and I need him at home?"'sald
a blue-eyed little girl to the officer lhat
was escorting Judge Fritz's allotment
of accused from the Jail to the court
room.
"I can't let him go, my dear," was
the bluecoat's kindly answer; "only
the Judge can do that."
Tears suffused the blue eyes, and
with a sob the child ran to one of the
prisoners, a rather decent looking man,
who stooped and kissed her. Then she
grasped his unmanacled hand and
clung to it caressingly until they ar
rived-at the Â» barred inclosure. . where
the officer tenderly released her clutch
and placed the man in the'eage. When
that was done he went up to the bench
and whispered something to the Judge,
who glanced at the* weeping child and
nodded approvingly. Then the father
was taken otffof the "pen" and per
mitted to sit beside' the little one.
It was a case of failure to provide,
and. the defendant told of how inability
to obtain employment had led to de
spondency and drink. He was penitent.
"Take your baby and go home," said
the Judge. "If you were really a neg
lectful father the child would not be
so fond of you."
"The case is continued," said the
Judge, "as I am satisfied that an effort
is afoot to purchase the silence or per
vert the testimony of (witnesses for the
prosecution. I want the police to Inves
tigate the matter and arrest the would
to bribe givers. All the witnesses in
the case are now requested to aid in
the capture and punishment of any
person that tries to corrupt them by
offering money. It is the duty of a
witness thus approached to follow the
person who tempts him and point him
out to~a police officer, who will do the
rest."
The witnesses in the case of the peo
ple vs. Nolan looked very serious as
they filed out of court.
A tale of attempted bribery of a wit
ness was unfolded by Mary ' Hughes
to Judge Mogan and impelled the court
to continue the case of William Nolan,
alias William Bray, charged with high
way robbery.
There are two complaints against N6
lan, each of them sworn to by a wo
man. On the night of April 13 Annie
Reinshager of 460 Geary street was
waylaid and robbed of a small, sum
of . money by p. man, and the follow
ing night Mary Hughes of 15 Powell
street was similarly treated. Each of
the women has identified Nolan as her
assailant. When the case was on hear
ing yesterday Mrs. Hughes showed
such reluctance to testify that the
Judge took 'her in hand and forced her
to state that on two occasions she had
been approached with an offer of
money to* induce _ her to abstain from
prosecuting: Nolan. .-One of the- pro
posals was, made by a light complex
ioned man and the other by a man
of swart countenance. Each of . them
visited her room and offered to pur
chase her silence for $30, a half of
which she was to give to the pother
prosecutrix. The bribe was refused,
and then she was requested to stay
away from court until arrangements
lould be made to raise the bid.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Sharp questioning of the woman by
the Judge elicited the information that
while her husband was held to an
swer In the Federal court on a charge
of counterfeiting she had been the com
panion of Besllia, who finally tired of
her nnd decided to go to Alaska. With
the traditional fury of the . wt>man
scorned, she determined to avenge her
abandonment, and with that end In
view she sent Besllia to deposit her
Jewels In a safety vault and then
sought to have him arrested and de
tained for stealing them.
"It's lucky for you, madame, ' said
the Judge, as he tore up the woman's
unsigned complaint, "tnat these facts
came to light before you succeeded in
having the man arrested, else you
would find yourself in more serious
trouble than you axe trying to bring
upon him."
The Woman applied for a warrant for
the arrest of Joseph Carlssl and Frank
Besifta on the charge of felony '; em
bezzlement, and stated, in substantia
tion of her complaint that they had
stolen from her apartment at . 8 Pres
cott Court about $200 worth of ' Jew
elry and were about to sail for Alaska
with the proceeds of their plunder. Her
story was told with all* earnestness, and
she would probably have secured the
desired warrant if an attorney had not
dashed jfnto court and protested against
its issuance on the ground that the
woman. had trumped up the charge for
the sole purpose of punishing Besllia
by preventing his departure to the
northern fisheries.
Mrs. Julia Vanni. a buxom little Ital
ian, endeavored Â¦ to utilize ., the law's
machinery to punish her recreant lover,
but Judge Mogan, nipped her scheme
in the bud and gave' her a lecture that
has probably enhanced her opinion of
the law's majesty. " \
Charles Gale, j convicted of battery,
was given thirty days by Judge Mogan.
The complaining witness was Miss
Clara Goodman, who was walking with
a. young man when Gale, maddened by
jealousy, struck, her on the face, and
was promptly . knocked down by her
escort, his skull, being fractured -by its
Impact with a curbstone.
The death of a witness whose testi
mony.was essential to conviction re
sulted in dismissal of the felony em
bezzlement charge against Charles
Clark in Judge Mogan's court. Clark
was accused of embezzling $108 50 while
he was employed as bookkeeper for the
Farmers' and Manufacturers' Associa
tion of America, and it was on motion
of the District Attorney that the case
was dismissed.

"Mrs. â¢ McGibney, the purloining of
Mrs. Zickgruff's hens and the battering
of. Mrs. Zickgruff's face seems to have
become a habit with you, and to en
able 5'ou to get rid of it I will sentence
you to as long a term of Imprisonment
as the law allows.\ Call around again
Monday." (
Mrs. Ellen McGlbney" on two sepa
rate occasions was caught in the act of
stealing chickens from the poultry yard
of Mrs. Mary Zlckgruff, at 121 Converse
street, and on each occasion Mrs. Zick
gruff's remonstrance against the pil
fering of her feathered property was
followed by a display of fistic science
on the part of Mrs. McGibney and
damage to the face of Mrs. Zickgruff.
It was on Friday last that the latest
attack by Mrs. McGibney upon the
countenance of Mrs. Zickgruff was
made, and as evidence of it Mrs. Zick
gruff showed a broken nose yesterday
to Judge Mogan, who said to the de
fendant: t . - â¢ 'Â¦ Â¦ :
Because he attempted to promote the
safety of pedestrians passing his dwell
ing, on Broadway, between Front and
Davis streets, Louis Chlccl y/as ar
rested for laying a wooden sidewalk
without a legal permit to do so.
Mr. Chlccl explained to Judge JIo-.
gan that the timbers composing the
footway fronting his residence are old
and loose,' and that his religious sense
has often been shocked by the pro
fanity uttered by persons whose shins
were barked by j detached planks fly
ing up and striking them. It was in
a spirit of philanthrophy, he said,' and
with no Intention to defy the laws, that
he procured a hammer and some nails
and started to fasten down the pro
vokers of unholy language, and in that
occupation ,he "was industriously en
gaged when a policeman gathered him
in.

"Save me from myself," said George
Smith to Patrolman Winslow last Fri
day evening on Third street.
"What's the matter with you?" in
quired the officer.
"I have been hitting up the 'booze'
steadily for a week,", replied George,
"and now I'm in the stage that tempts
suicide. If you don't lock me up I'll
likely be a dead one to-morrow." "
The officer complied with the request,
and ere the prisoner arrived at the
Hall of Justice his lucid interval had
lapsed and he was a frenzied Inebriate.
A night of solitary confinement and
enforced abstinence from intoxicants
restored his reason to some extent,
however, and his mind was pretty clear
as he ' faced Judge Slogan yesterday
morning. To complete the sobering
process he was given another week's
imprisonment.

Charles Thompson was sauntering
along Pinckney alley last Friday even-
Ing, when, Beulah Faggett Huddenly
emerged from her dwelling and smash
ed a heavy crockery basin upon his
head. He went down and. out and
she was taken to" prison for battery.
Mr. Thompson's mental faculties were
rather confused when hÂ© tried to* ex
plain why he had been assaulted,, but
enough of his story s was intelligible to
convince the police that he had offered
no provocation- for the. woman's act.
She is reserving her defense until â¢ the
case is called before Judge Conlan to
morrow.
/
Stealing bread was the charge
against Thomas Wilson and the com
plainant was a Mission grocer.
"Before stealing .that loaf," the de
fendant pleaded before Judge Fritz, "I
had eaten nothing for thirty-six hours
and continually , walked the streets
during thalt time. I have lived in San
Francisco thirty-five years and once
was well-to-do. Speculation in mining
stocks ruined me, and of all the men
that once called me friend | not one
will keen me 'from starvation or theft
by giving me employment."
The complaining grocer stated that
he did not desire to prosecute Wilson
and the charge was dismissed.
That's how Miss Dalton explained
the case to Judge Mogan. yesterday
morning, and bo deeply impressed was
his Honor by the pathos of the narra
tive that he continued the case â¢ till
next Wednesday, by Which time the
defendants hope' to have, sufficient
testimony to convince him that their
imprisonment would convey to the up
per stratum of Barbary Coast society
a deprivation most cruel. *

Another -addition to the President's
menagerie arrived the other day on the
Lowther Castle. The latest animals
to be added to the White House "zoo"
are a voung Hon from : the "Lion of
Abyssinia," with a jackal as an at
tendant- King Menelik also sent two
magnificent elephant tusks as a token
of friendship. The animals were taken
on board at Port Said. These gifts are
really from Menelik to the President,
and are not being announced as such
by a press agent of the St. Louis ex
position. "
The lion and hyena were taken off
the Lowther Castle and brought to
Jersey City, where they, were at. once,
sent on to Washington. The hyena is
not' the ferocious beast he has been
reported to. be, and the lion cub is as
playful arid awkward as a setter pup.
At the present time he is all legs and
has great difficulty . in placing Â« them
where he wants to. . A side view of
him closely resembles an .antique
clotheshorse that is somewhat' wobbly

hyena 1 and Hon .were aJlowed loose on
the decks, and^ spent most of their
time playing with the captain's dog. ;
On board the Lowther ; Castle were
fifty-one other animals consigned " to
the Lincoln Park Â¦ Zoological Gardens,
Chicago. Chief among them were two
thirty-foot rock; pythons, two v Malay
bears. * one . gibbon," one orang-outang,
twenty- two . monkeys of, all ; sorts and

I Stanford Tennis Players Are Clearly
Outclassed by the Cracks From
University of California.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April
16. â The University of California
again won the Intercollegiate tennis
tournament to-day, the matches being
played on the Stanford courts. The
blue and gold players clearly out
classed the cardinal racket wielders.
Drummond MacGavin and Neil Baker
won the singles contests from George
Hodge and Cleve Baker respectively,
while the doubles match was called,
with the score 5-6 In the first set,
on account of a heavy downpour of
rain, that rendered the courts too
slippery to be played upon. Mac-
Gavin and Varlel represented Califor
nia In the doubles, while Hodge and
CJeve Baker composed the Stanford
team. The doubles gave promise of
being a very close and exciting con
test.
MacGavin and Hodge were pitted
against each other in the first of the
singles matches. The former experi
enced little difficulty In defeating the
cardinal representative in two straight
sets by the score Â¦ ot 6-3, 6-2. Mac-
Gavin's smashing" was too much for
Hodge, although the latter appeared
to have a little the better of It at lob
bing.
Neil Baker of Berkeley won from
Cleve Baker of Stanford In two
straight sets, the score being 13-11,
6-4. The outcome of this match was a
great surprise to the majority of the
spectators, as Cleve Baker appeared
capable of playing the better game.
His work was very erratic, however,
and he was unable to follow up tho
advantages that he frequently had. He
also showed poor judgment In placing
his returns.

was sunk on March 18 and her entire

"The officer in charge ought fre
queutly to have scanned the horizon,"
said L.ord Selborne."but he had orders
to look out for his Majesty's ship Juno
and In his anxiety to observe her he
forgot too long to ' scan the horizon.
The officer subsequently saw looming
in his Held of vision the bows of a
great ship. He rapidly turned his
tube, saw the ship was right on top of
him and immediately made his sub
marine boat dive, and to show the
tragedy o^ the event It appears that
there were only three seconds between
the crew and safety. Three seconds
more would have taken the submarine
boat under the ship."

A Good Story, But â
There has Just been discovered In the
Far East a species of the acacia tree
which closes its leaves together in colls
each day at sunset and curls its twigs
to the shape of pigtails. After the tree
has settled itself thus for a night's
sleep, if touched the whole thing will
flutter as if agitated or Impatient at
being disturbed. oftener the
foliage is molested, - the more violent
becomes the shaking of the branches,
and at length the tree emits a nauseat
ing odor, which. If inhaled for a few
moments, causes a violent dizzy head
ache. -It has been named the "angry
tree." â New York Tribune.

THE Sacramento Bee says that the reason why
Northern California does, not share in -the heavy
tourist travel to this State is the lack of hotels.
This is probably true. If Sacramento had an attractive
hotel for tourists there seems no reason why it should
not attract that travel as well as Southern California
points. \
A few years ago the Chief oi- the Bureau of Good
Roads in the Agricultural Department attended â¢ a good
roads convention in Sacramento. As he sat in the con
vention he looked out through a grove of orange trees,
with the fruit ripe and yellow, and as. a\ background
rose the far mountains covered with snow, for it was
in January. He said that nowhere else w/s- a more
attractive scene and he seemed impressed that the peo

Sacramento has in the Sutter Fort a monument of our

O;N the same day Senator Bailey of Texas was de-.
Â¦ nouncing the civil service law in the Senate rand
Civil Service Commissioner Cooley was uphold
ing it with the applause of the studentsof the University
of California. Senator Bailey boldly declared himself a
spoilsman. When a political party captures the .na
tional administration he thinks it should make a clean,
sweep and capture every place down, to the charwoman
aj party, patronage. He takes the view of the average
politician,. who wants the chance, to advance himself by
billeting upon the public service those who work f of his
advancement to the exclusion of others, even* in his own
party, who has not guessed the winner in a nominating
convention. .
It will be seen that the Senator wants each member of
Congress to be a sort of Civil Service Commissioner, who
shall, have the power to put men into service) excluding
others,' and not testing the . fitness of his appointees, : but "
making their fealty to him the test of their eligibility. The
country tried that plan until the passage of the Pendle
ton brll, and 'since , then the law has prettyj well extermf
nated-the 'spoils system for which Senator Bailey pants
as "th'e; hart pantcth for the water brook. . : ... \
Any one familiar with the departmental: service in
Washington must notice the vast change- wrought^ in' it <
since : it ; was sheltered from the spoils "system; Formerly.
the,department clerk was an impermanent quantity.' His*
commercial credit was low and the uncertainty of'his
tenure made him financially irresponsible. "The trades
people suffered great losses in moneyand*
th'e 'service. in nepiitation. â¢ 'â¢'Â¦.. ..'-/.. , .
. Now, the clerk is a -'fixture. /His credit *is good because
he, must keep it so, and the character of! the service -has
been immensely /"improved. We;are inclined to think
that the^applause. of university students .indicates > that'
the. spoils system is gone to stay "gone," and that the 'co'un;

Where It Is Cold.
The coldest city, in the world Is Ya
kutsk, Eastern Siberia, in the empire
of the. Czar and' the Russians. It is the
great commercial emporium of East
Siberia and the capital of the -province
of Yakutsk, which. In mÂ«st- of Its areri
of 1,517,063 square miles, is a bare
desert, the soil of which is frozen to a
great depth. Yakutsk consists of about
400 houses of European structure,
standing apart. The intervening spaces
are occupied by winter yoorts, or huts
of the northern nomads, with earthen
roofs, doors' covered with hairy hides
and windows of ice. Caravans with
Chinese 'and European goods collect the
produce of the whole line of coast on
the Polar Sea between the parallels of
70 and 74 degrees, from the mouth of
the - River Lena to the farthest point
inhabited by. the Chookchees. Last
year a colporteur of the British and
Foreign Bible Society made a tour of
eleven weeks down the Lena, a river
3000 miles long, . visiting Yakutsk and
selling gospels in their own language

War and the Markets.
The reason why an international war
should have a far-reaching, effect on
financial values deserves explanation,
because it Is .very imperfectly â¢ grasped
by the community, at; large. To most
people the matter, seems simple enough.
In ordinary, comment in such events,
there .will be found a prevalent infer
ence that the securities of a given state,
in time of war, . rise or rail according
as that , state is victorious or unsuc
cessful, because success In the contest
will 'make for national prosperity and
defeat for national, adversity. , There is
a grain, of truth in the theory thus out
lined, ''but it is'nbt a complete explana
tion. It/does .not, for example,' explain
why public securities of both bellige
rents should decline on the outbreak of
a war, even when, as In our Spanish
war,, the result of the conflict Is not
in doubt. It does not explain why the
state victorious in the , Transvaal war
should have suffered more heavily in
its markets than the defeated power in
the war of 1898. -It cannot account for
the fact that, during our Revolutionary
war,' British Government securities
used* to. decline all- the more rapidly
when news Â¦ of a. British victory, was
received in .London.
Â¦ This. last .incident points to the funda
mental â¢ truth, which is, " that security
values are â¢ affected simply, and solely
because, of, the enormous expense of
war, which leads to sale of new securi
ties, .whereby the .general level of
values, necessarily . is lowered. In the
case of : England, during our Revolu
tionary, war, the London market held
the opinion that, if the Americans were
successful in . a few engagements, the
war would be brought to a -close, but
that, if the English were, to gain the
advantage the struggle would be pro
tracted 'without the probability of
bringing it to a close: The underlying
principle of -war markets is that the
enormous costliness of-war, particular
ly-in-modern times, makes absolutely
necessary very large borrowing opera
tions by. the contending governments.
Estimates of recent wars, including the
Japanese Var- with China in 1894 and
England's war.. In ; the Transvaal be
tween 1899 and 1902, Indicate that even
a small war of that, character can
not be fought to a finish except by an
average expenditure of fully a million
dollars daily.: French statisticians have
lately reckoned that a conflict in
Europe between- two first-class conti
nentar powers would cost each of them
in the neighborhood of $5,000,000 a day.
These^estimates may Â¦ or; may not be
exaggerated, but they show what fin
ancial: requirements may. be involved in
such a conflict.
: Now no Government possesses a fund
of money sufficient to wage such; a' war
for; any long period, nor is '\ It possible
for any Government to * Introduce new!
taxes such as would raise from its peo
ple the sum required. - Hence it , must
have recourse to the" accumulated capi
tal of the world's money market. . In
the case : of the Japanese swar of 1894
with China, ..which lasted only, seven
months, all , the money was . raised - at
*hbnie through V loans or ' through in
creased taxes.! But in the - Boer; war,
England, had to. borrow $600,000,000; and
the strain of these Â¦ loans, with ;, that': of
the increased taxes which accompanied
them,*Vwas such as fairly to exhaust the
"resources ; of English .capital.-; At Â¦ least
two of / ' the British . warj loans were
placed,. in large measure, , on other mar
kets,' such as Paris and^New York; 'and
even where this expedient jvas not fol- ;

SACREDNESS OF THE FLAG.
UNDER a New York statute which makes it unlaw
ful to attach to a national flag or the representa
tion of a national flag any words, marks or ad
vertisements exploiting the merits of merchandise or in
any way advancing the' business interests of an individual
or corporation a case was recently tried in that State,
which' resulted in the imposing of an unfavorable con
struction upon this eminently commendable law. The
court decided' that the enforcement of this statute was
in violation of the legitimate exercise of the police power
and that it made an unfair discrimination against mer
chants, in that jewelers, seal-makers and, stationery em
bossers were exempt from its operations as the law now
stands.
It has been saidby biting critics from across the water
that Americans have no sense of, reverence and very lit
tle conception of the eternal fitness of thinjjs. / Our Old
World friends are prone to aver that the pursuit of the
almighty dollar will lead the average American where
angels fear to tread and they take great glee in pointing
out as instance the fearful and wonderful spirit which
moves the .freak advertising methods of some : of our
merchants. "Pale -Pellets" painted on the craggy scarp of
the Niagara; "La Mort Cigarettes" flashed' upon the
clouds by a stereopticon; "Aunt Hannah's, Twin Babies
Desiccated Dessert" hung in the air by a string of kites â
these afe things which appeal to the uncommercial and
highly Ruskinized sensibilities of our European xpusins
with something of a shock. When they see, as the limit,
little children raise their hands in the daily, salute to the
'flag and then, within the same hour mayhap, bring home
to their mothers a can of beans or a rasher of bacon with
the stars and stripes gleaming cffulgently. from the gaudy
wrapper thereof, they 'must indeed be pardoned for
thinking a few things about the intricacies in'the Ameri
can character.
If the State law in New York has proven ineffectual
in. stopping the practice of adapting-our national banner
to the exigencies of trade it lies within" the power of
Congress to make a ruling which shall 1 be binding the
country over. The Government has power "to regulate
the use of the very emblem of its existence. By restrict 1
ing the functional qualities of the flag to- those proper
ones of patriotic expression and the exemplification of
the .majesty of the Government Congress could bring
about a far .healthier respect for the emblem of our na-*;
tion and save it from becoming cheapened in our eyes \
by association with canned tomatoes or ladies', hosiery. /

A Snake Story:
A New York paper prints the follow
Ing capital yarn, which is well qualified
to take rank with Mark Twain's classic
about the buffalo who "climb" a tree.
Here it is:
* "Many creatures of the tropic zone
arrived yesterday aboard the Atlantic
transport liner Marquette from Lon
don, and a few of them of antagonistic
temperaments got into scraps on the
way across.
"A' monkey and a porcupine had a
dispute and the porcupine wrote its
monogram on the monkey. But the
greatest sport to the animal keepers
was a duel between a crocodile and a
python.
"The crocodile Is a pet of Mrs. Szar
vasi of the Sells-Forepaugh show and
is called Sappho. The python, so the
classic press agent who gave out the
story said, Is named Phaon.
"Three nights ago the python, said to
be ' about twenty feet long, escaped
from its box and discovered the pet
crocodile, and made an effort to squeeze
Its life out. But the scaly armor of the
saurian was unbendable and could not
be cracked even by the rigorous pres
sure of a forty-foot python's coil. The
crocodile lashed it stall in an ineffec
tual effort to reach the python, whose
eighty feet were wound around the
crocodile, chiefly, amidships.
"The animal men discovered the com
batants about an hour after they had
been in conflict, and tried to uncoil the
160 feet of python. It was an Impossi
ble task, as the' coils had become as
rigid as steel. â¢
"Then the men decided to uncork the
coil by pulling out the crocodile with
the help of Â«. steam winch and a
hawser.
/'"The python presented a somewhat
remarkable appearance after the sepa
ration. It simply could not uncoil Itself
and the animal men rolled it, as they
might a -Ions barrel, back to its box.
They/then drove it, tail first, into an
opening, as if it had been a corkesrew.
It had relaxed yesterday and looked
just like any other python 320 feet
long." '-y* v/f X

The new International Sanitary Con
vention, which wu signed in ParlÂ» on
December 3. 1903, by the representa
tives of the powers, made considerable
changes in the regulations previously
In force to prevent the Invasion and
propagation of cholera and plague.
For instance, it abridged and even
suppressed quarantine, on condition
that there be a complete disinfection
of every vessel, her passengers, crew
and cargo, and a complete destruction
of all rats and mice on board. War on
rats on board ship, supervision of ves
sels from that special point of viewâ
euch is the new orientation of the mar
itime prophylaxis in regard to plague
There was a time when the rats ren
dered service; in the days when drains
Â¦were unknown, and when the roads
served the double purpose of highways
and places of deposit for refuse. By de
vouring the refuse the rats, to a certain
extent, protected the purity of the at
mosphere and consequently the public
health. To-day, when this part of their
natural functions is no longer needed,
rats have no longer a "raison d'etre,"
or at any rate they should be kept
â¢within their native country.
It Is interesting to know. In fact,
that the rat is an immigrantâ an in
vaderâand that it comes from the East.

end '..he brown rat, are of foreign ori
gin and emanate from Asia. The black
rat Is the older and the smaller. It Is
distinguished by its tail being longer
than its body. The brown rat (in French
"Surmulot") has a large, fat body and
a much shorter taiL The black rat is
a field rat. The brown rat. which lives
In towns, makes a war of extermination
upon it; therefore it takes refuge In
th* country, having no chance of exist
ing except out of the reach of its rival.
In the eighteenth century, according to
M. H. de Varigny, there was only one
epecies of ratâ the black ratâ which at
that period frequented both town and
country. The brown rat arrived later.
The immigration of the black rat ap
pears to have dated from the fall of
the Roman Empire, and it is believed
that the Crusades facilitated its dis
semination in the West. It is described
i.. the thirteenth century by Albertus
Magnus. Once arrived in Europe, it
quickly spread to all parts, thanks to
commerce and navigation. About 1544
It made Its way to America, and by
the middle of the nineteenth century It
had crossed the continent to the Pacific
at the earne time spreading north and
south, to Texas and Canada. It lived
and flourished for a certain time, until
th<? brown rat arrived.
This variety also came from the
East. In an Interesting article by M.
H. de Varigny. in the Temps, we are
told that it made its appearance in Eu
rope in the first half of the eighteenth
century- For some unknown reason,
hordes of these rats crossed the Volga
near Astrakhan. It has been supposed
that they were driven West by the fam
ine in India or by earthquakes in the
Caspian region. In 1750 brown rats in
vaded Russia, and also appeared in
Prussia; In 1730 they were brought to
England by. merchant vessels; in 1753
they took up their quarters in Paris.
Subsequently they invaded the other
countries of Europe, passing into Den
mark in 1790 and Switzerland in 1S09.
In certain parts of Jutland they did not
appear until within fifty or sixty years
ago.
"The brown rat," M. H. de Varigny
eays. "being larger, stronger and more
voracious, quickly turned out the black
rat. It starved its predecessor and de
voured him as well. In the present day
the black rat is a rare curiosity, at any
rate in cities; in country districts it is
Btill to be found, though in all cases it
disappears before the invasion of the
brown rat."
The rat is in every respect a harmful
animal; it is an insatiable rodent, to
which nothing eatable comes amiss.
When hungry it will even attack man;
and in certain badly-kept hospitals
rats have been known to have finished
off eick and feeble inmates.
Moreover, the rat is - great traveler.
The hold of a 6hip is to him an earthly
paradise. He always finds goods there
and various kinds of provisions. Em
barkation has no difficulties for him. He
works by night, when no one can place
obstacles in his way, and while the
Bhip Is moored to the quay. He enters
Ly passing along the ropes, communi
cating freely between the vessel and
the dock.
Within the past few years another
element has complicated the situation.
The rat is not only the enemy of goods;
it constitutes a serious danger to the
public health. As Is now fully realized,
it U one of the principal agents In the
propagation of plague. A victim of the
disease which it propagates. It commu
nicates the germs to the fleas from
which he received It. The fleas bite
other rats or men, and. Infect them, and
thus plague Is propagated. It thus hap
pens that a ship with all the appear
ance of perfect health on board may
be contaminated.
The passengers may be all right, says
M. H. de Varigny, but when the vessel
puts into a tainted port a rat enters
h*r along the mooring ropes. The rat
dies, but his fleas contaminate the rats
on board, and they in turn contaminate
the fleas, and the rats and fleas con
veyed with the goods on board carry
plague with them. The recent case at
Marseilles and others elsewhere con
clusively show how simple Is the chain
of events.
AH these facts have shown the In
ternational Sanitary Commission that
It was on the wrong tack when It at
tempted to combat plague by means
of quarantine. What it ought to have
done was to fight the rats. It is of
world's capital have some limit, It fol
lows that such sudden and enormous
demands will necessitate withdrawal
of Invested capital from "its previou*
location.â The Forum.
THE world over ?here are differences of opinion as
to what constitutes civilization. The Asiatic na
tions have one standard, the European another. The
European standard is determined largely by the injunc
tions of Christianity. Whether Christendom" is living up
to that standard need not be discussed. The Rev. Dr.
Abbott, one of the most learned and agreeable of our re
ligious philosophers, is of the that we are not
entirely civilized. He may be right, but his declaration
leaves room for a plea in defense. In an address to the
students of the University of California Dr. Abbott said:
"America, and I speak plainly, is not civilized.
A Government that allows some of its postoffice offi
cials to go wrong, a Government that puts into its Leg
islatures men whose sole ambition is to thrust their arms
deep into the public treasury, is not wholly, civilized."
We may grant the premise and yet make a plea in de
fense. Are we not doing as well as could be expected
even from the standpoint of Dr. Abbott's theology? Ac
cording to the cosmology of our theological teaching^thc
human race -started from a special creation and was per
fect. The morals of the original family were put in the
safest environment by locating it in a garden. That is
still regarded as the ideal condition of the race. Its con
tact with the soil, where it can plant and watch the green
things growing, is still believed to be the condition most
conducive to virtue.
In all ages, since they found song the poets have sung
of the green fields, the asphodel meadows, the blades of
grass diamond pointedly the dews of the morning. The
first family had all of these and was perfect. But the're
cord of its four members shows that just three-fourths of
them fell and the other did not survive but was killed by
the club of his brother. He was of preferred virtue, but
he had no children. Therefore, the sole member of the
primitive stock who could by heredity -have transmitted
virtue to the race perished childless and only the heredi
ty of the other three was perpetuated.
Under these circumstances the expected happened.
The race from such a start was a Jukes family from the
beginning. It got so bad that there was no doing any
thing with it and the face of the earth was- washed clean
of the whole set, except one family. This was a second
start. It was made under the most disciplinary and ad
monitory circumstances. These differed materially -and
vitally from the conditions under which the first experi
ment was made. There was no concert by the morning
stars; no garden and no idyllic conditions. The family,
selected for the second peopling of the earth was the wit
ness of an appalling physical calamity and was impressed
by the survival of the fittest afloat on the raging waters
with the steerage filled by the beasts of the field. The
whole experience was admonitory in the highest degree.
Yet what. happened in spite of these frightful manifes
tations? As soon as this family landed and was alone up
on the earth the father of it planted a vineyard, made
wine, got drunk and did unspeakable things which would
be indictable now, and one of the three sons was cursed
and sent forth an outcast. With that unpromising be
ginning the race took a second start.
Granting that a thousand years are as one in in
scrutable scheme we must insist that it has done as well
as could be expected. All of the families of man aver
age better, than cither of the two that began the peopling
of the earth. Evidence of this exists in the fact that it
has not since been found necessary to wipe out all of the
race but one household and start over.
It will not do to say that 'this has been omitted because
creative patience was exhausted in the two first attempts
and their failure. It will not do to say that man prpved
to be such a tough formation that Omnipotence de
spaired of his corrigibility. The earth is no bigger nor
are the cataclysmal elements less in volume and power
than when it was found necessary to cleanse this terres
trial ball with water. If things- are not improving the
means of correction still exist and erring postal officers
and legislators who commune with . Mazuma and all the
guilty by procurement or indifference can be whelmed in
It will not do to say that~this discipline is omitted be
cause of the existence of the rainbow and the covenants.
A covenant was made with the first family and it was
told positively that violation meant death. But this cove
nant was not kept though it was violated. . Dr. Abbott
puts stress into the need of reverence for the law. That
first covenant was the only law. There was no other
act entitled an act. But reverence for it was lacking and
it was broken and then the penalty was not visited upon
the transgressors. They were merely turned out of the
garden and condemned to cat their bread in the sweat of.
their faces, forced to exude in less agreeable pursuits.
The average respect for the law and the enforcement of
its penalties have greatly improved since then.
Therefore it is that we are inclined to take a hopeful
view of man. His two starts were rather hard sledding
and in his behalf it must always be pleaded that he never
petitioned to be created at. all. If, when he was simply
an amorphous part of chaos, he could have foreseen the
depressing view taken of him by some in these days it
is probable that instead of asking to be created he would
have filed a protest against it. - ;P-
'Beneath the Waves.
"You may talk about the beauties of
the Yosemite, . Niagara Falls, the .'Alps,
or any place on the itop .of theearth,"
said a well-known gunner in the
United States navy a. few nights ago at
the. Grand Hotel; "they.are not to,be
compared with .the beauties of old
ocean,' particularly such; as can be seen
from a diverts helmet." ;
- "You're right there," said another
gunner. "The lubbers do not know what
they have missed. - -I remember; once
when I was a gunner's- mate sitting for
more than on hour on the fluke of an
anchor I had been sent down to recover
and gazing with awe on a beautiful
coral bank. - It was really thetmost
beautiful' thing I ever saw. Every color
in the rainbow; was there and cside
from that there. was enough variety in
the, strangeness of the formation in the
coral to keep, one busy several hours,
cogitating on the wonderful things na
ture had seen , fit to hide beneath the
waves. I "would probably have remain
ed for several hours, gazing with rap
ture on the bank, and was really think
ing that down, there in the depths,
away from the noise and strife of moth
er earth, would suit me for >he rest of
my days when a 'soup-and-hully' tin
thrown. over the side of the ship drop
ped beneath me and the coral bank.
My dream was over.': It was a case of
quick transition from . the# sublime to
the 1 ridiculous and I immediately gave
the signal to be hauled up." ,
course very well to examine the pas
sengers on board ship, but It is Indis
pensable to destroy the rats and their
parasites. Absolutely none of them
must be allowed to remain aboard, es
pecially on vessels which visit plague
stricken countries. To avoid -the risk
of plague the rats .must be got rid of.
The rat question, as may be seen
from the above, is neither more nor less
than the plague question, and the" In
ternational Convention, to which I have
alluded at the beginning of this article,
Is only carrying out the conclusion
which the Hygienic Congress of Brus
sels adopted a few months previously.
It is not an uncommon thing in this
age of advancement in Industrial and
engineering matters for the present
day engineer to assume that he knows
much more than his ancient brother,
and while this is true in many things.
It frequently happens that an Invention
or appliance commonly believed to be
long to modern times Is found to have
been known and used centuries ago. â
Ropes made of various kinds of fiber
and leather are of very ancient date.
Ropes of palm have been found in
Egypt In the tomba of Beni-Hassan
(about 3000 B. C), and on the walls of
these tombs Is also shown the process
of preparing hemp. In a tomb at
Thebes of the time of Thothmes III
(about 1600 B. C.) is a group represent
ing the. process of twisting thongs of
leather and the method of cutting the
leather Into thongs. The Bible tells us
that Samson was bound with ropes and
that the spies sent by Joshua into
Jericho were let down in a basket, pre
sumably by means of a rope.
At Nimrod, Assyria, a carved slab
showing the siege of a castle was
found on which a soldier was repre
sented In the act of cutting a rope to
which a bucket for drawing water from
a well outside the castle walls was at
tached..
The wire rope is generally considered
a' modern invention, a product of mod
ern skill, and it will surprise many to
learn that its manufacture Is really a
rediscovered lost art.
Although the Assyrians practiced the
art of wire beating, no evidence has
been found to Indicate that they used
wire for making rope. The excavations
or Pompeii have, however, brought to
light a piece of bronze wire rope near
ly fifteen feet long and about one Inch
in circumference. This rope is now in
the Musio Borbonlco at Naples.
It consists of three strands' laid spir
ally together, each strand being made
up of fifteen wires twisted together,
and its construction does not. therefore,
differ greatly from that of wire ropes
made to-day. Pompeii was buried A.
D. 79, over 1S00 years ago, but how long
wire ropes had then been known it is
impossible to tell, though. Judging by
the knowledge shown in the construc
tion, it may be safely conclud
ed that they had been known for a
considerable time. The uses to which
these ropes were put is not definitely
known, but further excavations may
shed some light on the subject. â Mines

Official control of the oyster trade to
secure immunity from disease germs
must at present, as in the case of milk,
depend on a test of the product at the
market. Ii. both cases the source of
supply Is usually beyond the Jurisdic
tion of the municipal health officer. It
has been thought by many bacteriolog
ists that the presence of the bacillus
coli communls in oysters was a positive
indication of pollution by sewage, and
in England, until very recently, this
tes.t has been applied in determining
the edibility of shell fish. Recent re
searches have shown it, however, to be
of very doubtful value. The fourth re
port of the Royal British Commission
on Sewage Disposal, among whose
members are such well-known scien
tists as Sir Michael Foster, Sir William
Ramsay and Dr. J. B. Russell, contains
an account of experiments made to test
this test.- Dr. A. G. Houston, who ex
amined over a thousand oysters for the
commission, reported that nearly all of
them contained some form of the colon
bacillus. Other observers found that
this organism was very widespread, oc
curring on raw meat, in dust, on fruit,
and even in new-born infants, where
any outside infection could be entirely
eliminated. In short, the only discov
ery in any way confirming the diag
nostic value of bacillus coli was that,
usually, oysters.which had fed on sew
age contained more bacilli than those
from pure water. The commission
hence takes the ground that nobody is
Justified Jn condemning oysters on the
result of a bacteriological examination
alone. They recommend that the ques
tion of securing a nure oyster supply
be placed in- the hands of a central
"Rivers Board," having Jurisdiction
over all the beds in the country. If
the beds are protected from sewage
a pure product is assured. â New York

There are. it is alleged, several dis
crepancies In the foregoing statement,
which were shown by a search of the
home of the man who made It. by \a
secret service agent. A reporter was
informed that "evidence was found
which might or might not be incrim
inating." This evidence is now in the
hands of the secret service officials.
The Italian was examined on the
same day. . He contradicted the state
ment of the other man as to their
meeting for the first time a few
months ago. He said that they had
known each other for many years and
that their wives were close friends.
He denied all knowledge of the order
for a plate.â New York Tribune.
F. A. Ringler & Co. of No. 26 Park
place Informed the Secret Service Bu
reau of . the Colombian's visit to their
establishment for the purpose of having
made a plate for the reproduction of
Colombian one hundred dollar bills, of
which he carried, ope. They told him to
call the next "da y. and then told Captain
Flynn. By communicating with the
Colombian Consul General in this city
the captain learned that the man who
ordered the plate had no authority to
do so. Captain Flynn â¢ called him to
his office, where he made an affidavit
placing all the blame on his friend, the
Italian. This affidavit, which was
made in the presence of Lillian Her
bert Andrews, counselor of the Colom
bian Legation, said:
_' "I first met (name of friend) at the
Barranqullla office of the Hamburg-
American Steamship Company. I
went there to buy a ticirÂ»t for New
York; He was there for the same
purpose. He is a Mason and he rec
ognized in me a brother, in that order.
I sunoosed he was a good man.
"I next saw him on board the
steamer Allegheny, on which we sailed
for New York, arriving here on Jan
uary 12, 1304. On the trip he asked
me V> do an errand for him 'here, as
he talks no English. lie asked me to
get the price of a plate for making
one hundred dollar bills. I was di
rected to F. A. Ringler & Co.. No.
26 Park place, and was told to call
next day. .In the meantime I received
a letter from the Colombian Consul
General, whom I knew, telling me. to
call at the consulate. Then I went
to â â and asked him if he had au
thority to have the plate made and
he said he had not. Thereupon I
went to Ringler and got back the
note."
What is believed to have been a' plan
to counterfeit on an elaborate scad e
$100 notes of the republic of Colombia
was discovered recently by Captain
William J. Flynn qÂ£ the United States
Secret Service, and frustrated, although
no arrests have yet been made. One of
the men implicated is a Colombian; who
livfjs in Lefferts Park and whose -wife
is at the head of a charity. Another is
an Italian architect of Barranqullla,
Colombia, who is at present living in
this city.

no pain. My eyes are growing dimmer.
I can hardly see you. I- feel as if I was
going to sleep. It is quite dark now. I
can't see any one. I can feel each sec

After a few more incoherent whis
pers, Pollock sank into unconscious
ness. As the doctors entered the house
he died.
CLEVELAND, April 16. â As Otto
Pollock, a carpenter, was bleeding to
death to-day he described his sensa
â¢ tions and save detailed instructions re
i yarding his funeral. When Pollock got
I out of bed this morning to go to work,
ho began to cough. The coughing fit
continued for several minutes and a
hemorrhage resulted. -As he slowly bled
I to death he realized his condition and

â¢ structions regarding his funeral.
I "Cremate me," he gasped. "You
I know our compact, Lubahn. Don't

'all farewell. Then for ten minutes he

IS THE TITLE OF THE
...ART SUPPLEMENT... .
By Charles Van den Eycken
TO BE GIVEN WITH THE
NEXT SUNDAY CALL
The proverbial playfulness of kittens Is a favorite subject with painters who
eho<w their models from the domesticated branch of the feline tribe. The fact that
ttie little animals hare not been endowed with discretion in their choice of playthings. '
itloas vvith their instinct for play often leads them to do much mischief, and it is
Ibis nii*c!i!ef which furnishes* an inexhau>tible fund of material upon which such art-
ist* as Eugenie Lambert; Mme. Ilenriettc Ronncr and Charles Van den Eycken, the
painter of the original of this art supplement, have drawn In producing the pictures
which are their life work.
Other artists of more serious temperament have used cats as models for repre-
sentation* of the savaee members or the same family. The anatomy of the .domestic
oat is almost 'identical with that or many of its wild cousins, and the fact that the sav-
age instincts of its ancestors imve only a thin veneer of the domestication makes it
. a'ViuipIe matter for .an artist to transform Uift household tabby into a tiger oiyllon-
ess. aÂ« Delacroix frequently did. One needs only to observe a eat drinking, eating
or sialkii;Â£ a mouse or sparrow to note tho resemblance recalled by . Wliittier. who
Â«iis|il:i;.ed mtjeti Â«r a painter's instinct in his description in Uic lines. in "Snow Bounil''
-XhC cat's dark silhouette on the wall, a couchant timer's seemed to fall."
In garb pictures a* the one which is the subject of this notice there are the ele^
menis of lively, action and a pleasing suggestion of innocence and joyousness which
malce them jusUy popular. In Van den Kycken's painting tfiere is also bright and .
agreeable color and fckillful brush work.
Charles Van den Kycken is a Belgian of pure Flemish descent. He is still a
rosins man and has every prospect of becomins even more famous in his chosen
brztndi of art than the celebrated Mme. Konner, whose pupil he Is. His studio is in
Antwerp in the same building as that of his former instructor. During the last dec-
ade his works ha\e liecomc well known in America and the sale of his pictures in this
t -ountrv is steadily increfcsins.

remarkable, when the importance of -the
position, both from an educational and

School, Â¦ and A. W. Scott, : principal of
the ? Alameda High : School, have de

Roncovieri also that it Is.pro

is to say that the man with' the strong
est political backing ' will j have no ad
vantage over a â¢ man that' possesses^su
perior qualifications for the position. Â¦

Roncovieri. : "The appointee must have

Evidence That Cnrfagnl Killed . Mary
Werner and Himself While Crazed
by Jealousy.
Coroner' Lfland held an Inquest
yesterday on the bodies of Louis Car
fagni and Mary Werner, the victims of
the suicide and murder tragedy which
took place on Aprli 8 in Carfagni's
tailor shop at the corner of Sacra
mento and Kearny streets.
The testimony showed that Car
fagni^who was madly in love with the
woman, became crazed through
jealousy and 6hot her and himself.
The evidence was that the woman had
been keeping company with other
men. and the theory was advanced
that immediately "before the shooting
the two had words about the matter
and Carfagni In a moment of frenzy
shot the woman and himself.
A verdict in accordance with the
facts was rendered. J ' ..

The Supervisors' Finance Committee
will take steps at to-morrow's meet
ing of. the board to recover from the
estate of the late Commissioner of Pub
lic Works George H., Mendell his pro r
portion of the defalcation of $8000 of
ex-Cashier W. J. H. White , of the
Board of Public Works. :
The fact that Mendell's estate has
been finally , distributed Inclines, the
committee to the^ opinion that it will
be impossible to recover any, money
therefrom and that restitution will
have to be looked; for from the'bonds
men of MendellT^
The Finance Committee blames May
or Schmitz for neglecting to ," begin
proper legal | proceedings against . the
estate before final distribution was
made. As far back, as last June, the
Mayor was requested to take steps to
recover the amountof the shortage for
which ex-Commissioner. Marsden Man
son, Commissioner Casey and the- late
Commissioner Mendell. are responsible,
the defalcation having occurred during
their incumbency. White had given a
bond of $3000 with a surety company;'
thus leaving $5000 to be made up by
the Commissioners under whom White
was a subordinate at. the- time he em
bezzled the city's funds. The Finance
Committee contends that if Mayor
Schmitz had not delayed in the.matter
the 'Mendell 'estate would nave had to
pay its Drorata of the shortage, and
now it may be too late tp recover It.
City Attorney Long will" be requested
by resolution of the board to institute
proceedings to recover from Mendell's
estate or . bondsmen tne amount for
which he is held responsible 'under the
charter, in this case something like
$1700. Suit will also be instituted
against Manson and Casey and their
bondsmen for a similar amount.

The will of Adam Grant, the pioneer
merchant, founder of the firm of Mur
phy, Grant & Co., was filed for probate
yesterday. It ? was . made January 23,
1904, and the signature of the deceased
Is witnessed by Reuben H.. Lloyd, and
Percy E. Towne. The will disposes of
an estate worth more than $1,000,000.
Of the . estate $20,000. goes to charlty/
,the- rest being, devised to Emma Grant,
widow 'of the deceased; Joseph D.
Grant,! his son; Douglass and Josephine
Grant, children of the -latter, and other
relatives of the deceased. - â¢
The will: states that at the time of
his marriage deceased was worth $40,
000, and that as the estate he held at
the time of his death was the result
of a~careful investment of thisrsum he
considers the estate separate property.
He therefore leaves his widow $400,000,
the family residence at 1112 Ellis street
and a monthly Income of. $1000, .allow
ing her, however, to elect, if she so
chooses, to claim half of the estate,, the
share she would be entitled to if the
estate had; been community .property.
To Douglass. and Josephine Grant, his
grandchildren, he - teaves $100,000 "each,
they- to acquire absolute possession of
this sum at the time they become -25
years of- age, .providing that : ' in the
opinion of the ' trustees . of the estate,
Emma-' Grant* and Joseph Grant, they
are. capable; of managing .such a sum.
In the event that, the trustees con
sider them unfit, 1 then the bequests are
to be held in trust by the- trustees for
the benefit of the devisees. Grant de
vises* to ' his sister, Jessie McKay, an
income of $250 a year while the estate
is undergoing probate and $5000 cash
when it is finally" settled. He makes
the same sort of bequest to each of the
daughters of his deceased sister. Belle
McDonaJd. To â¢ his namesake, William
Grant Morrow, he leaves $2500. and to
his trustees $10,000. to be held by them
for the benefit of Mamie M. Hammond
of Chicago, providing that upon her
death this sum shall revert to Joseph
Grant. He also devises to the trustees
$8000 to be held by them for the benefit
of William Grant, his brother. The
residue of the' estate is devised to Jo
seph D. Grant, son of the deceased.
The charitable organizations men
tioned In the will are the Protestant
Orphan Asylum, the Roman Catholic
Orphan Asylum, the Ladles' Protective
and ,\Relfef ; Society and the Pacific He
brewyOrphan. Asylum. Each of these
institutions Is to receive $5000.
Grant 'provides" that none of the be
quests made by? him shall be paid un
lesSiln.iUie.-oplnion.of his son the firm
of" Murphy;' Grant 4 & Co. shall be able
to stand the 'withdrawal from" the busi
ness of the amounts devised.

of testimony before the. arbitration

begun early in February last and' tes
timony was taken up to March 19. A
great volume of evidence accumulated.
The surviving Eskimo boy, went on
to Chicago and what he had to say
was translated. There were three ar
bitrators â David F. Lane," who: was
selected by Hultberg; R. A. Pence of
Pence & Carpenter of Chicago, repre
senting Johnson, and Judge Hiram F/
Gilbert of Chicago, who was elected
by the other arbitrators to sit with
them, according to the agreement
reached in Alaska.- -The decision'. is
without appeal, so * says Mr. ' Soder
berg, and the property, now belongs
without doubt to the Swedish Evan

were Frank F/Qujnn.. of .Peoria, 111.,

ESKIMOS BIZI.VG SUIT.
One of the early developments was
a suit In behalf of the Eskimo boy,
Constantino, and the heirs of the other
Eskimo boy, Gabriel. The last named
lad Is reported to have died in desti
tution in Nome. This suit was dis
posed of- by compromise. The claim I
in dispute was conveyed by Anderson
to Dr. Claes \VJ Johnson of Chicago^
who af* ~afed in the subsequent pro
ceedings as the absolute owner of the
White Stnr Mining Company, to which
the mine was conveyed. ; Last June,
at the apnual conference of the Swed
ish Evangelical Covenant, the mining
property was talked about and it was
decided to proceed to get possession
V* iL
After some time a plan for the for
mation of an arbitration board was
Walter H. Soderberg has received a
dispatch from Chicago from N. Soder
berg, which contains news that will
be of Interest to every Scandinavian in
the United Slates, to every miner and
T;,Â«rson interested in raining in the
Nome district and to countless others
v ho have watched the progress of
somewhat unusual proceedings.
The essential point contained in the
dispatch is that the arbitrators ap
pointed to determine rival claims to
the famous mining claim, "No. 9
Above," en Anvil Creek, have decided,
at Chicago, thut to the Swedish Evan
gelical Covenant of America of Chi
cago belongs the property, and with
the decision goes an award of $263,600
for gold taken from the claim. This
sum is supposed to be recover
able. The pioperty is estimated to
have at least $100,000 of value remain
ing in it, so that the decision gives to
the Swedish Society practically ;3t>3,G0f)
for the purpose ot prosecuting mission
ary work among the natives of Alaska.
There Is quite a story co-nnected with
.the famous mining claim, its discov
ery and operation. In the arbitration
that has Just come to a close. P. H.
Anderson end the White Star Mining
kTompany and Claes W. Johnson of
T hicago were the parties nominally In
terested. Back of them was the Swed
l*h religic-us society and Its hope of
converting to Christianity the natives
of Alaska. The original idea in the
staking out of the claim on Anvil
Creek was to^ provide means to carry
on the missionary work among the
Eskimos. The mining land in the
claims is 1320x600 feet in dimensions.
The Swedish Evangelical Covenant c-f
America of Chicago some years ago
established a missionary station at
Golovin Bay nr.d also other mission
stations in Alaska. The Rev. Dr. X.
O. J'ultbers was given charge of the
Colovin Bay station. There were build
ings, beats and other conveniences at
li'.at place for eatrying on missionary
vÂ«uk. Among the picturesque acces
sories .WJiS. a herd of reindeer. Holt
berg made uiÂ» the first party that vis
ited the JCotne difUiA, xrhich was in
lM'V On that occasion no claims were
staked out. Retiring "to Golovin Bay.
ai.wilitrr pajty i<_- visit Nome was plan
iitJ by H tilt berg.. He was taken ill
end he soon alter left Alaska to return
v. the L r nited States. He left P. I-L
in charge of tfce mission sta
tion at CSolovin Bay.
FIirST CLAIMS STAKED.
The second uarty from Golovin Bay
went tp Nome in September, 189S. On
this <recask:n claims were staked. The
party staked for themselves and for
their friends and associates. Then, ac
cording to the story that has . formed
the basis of the decision Just rendered
in Chicago, the minds of the visiting
Swedes turned to the idea of staking
for the benefit of the missionary work
among the native? in Alaska. A claim
va? staked out for P. H. Anderson.
The famous "No. 9" was intended for
the benefit of the mission work. This
Claim was set aside in the name of
two Eskimo boys called Constantine
and Gabriel by the Swedes. Before the
claims were recorded advice was re
ceived that Eskimos cc-uld not hold
the property and that it was better
to relocate in the name of a citizen
.of the ITnited States. Accordingly "No.
was located in the name of L. W.
Price of Sonora, Cal., by G. W. Price,
en attorney. Soon after this It was
conveyed ttr P. H. Anderson, who was
in charge of the missionary station at i
Golovin Bay.
The claim proved to be very rich.
It has produced hundreds of thou
sands of dollars, possibly $400,000
ebove the cost of production. Out of
this grew the controversy that has
mirred the Scandinavians in the United
Ftates and has figured in the delibera
tions in one annual conference of the
Swedish Evangelical Covenant of
America. Anderson-held on to, the
property standing in his name and to
much of the proceeds therefrom.
Walter N. Soderbcrg and the Rev. Dr.
Hultberg became Interested. Soder
bÂ«Â»rg suggested a visit to Chicago and
the facts relating to the location of
the "No. 9" c)aim were discussed thor
oughly. In the meantime the claim
had been worked between three and
four years by Anderson. He donated
at different times something: like
t*:?.000 in total to the Swedish Evan
ffCt^cal Covenant. Suit was threatened
for the recover}' of the mine, but this
was obviated by a binding agreement
on the part of the parties in interest to
abide by any decision that should be
reached by arbitration.

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, , APRIL 17, 1904:Our Bessie will henceforth occupy a
ennspicuous place in the Oakland track
gallery of favorites. The .Texas bred
mare showed the way across the line
to quite a select gathering in the mile
and an eighth handicap across the bay
yesterdaj', and from the noisy demon
stration her victory was a popular one.
Bessie had but 9S pounds to handle,
and as Joe Jones was carded to do
the riding two-thirds of the big Satur
day crowd evinced a pronounced liking
for the Lone Star State beauty. She
closed a 9 to 5 favorite, and while her
margin over Grafter at the close was
scarcely wide, enough to prevent the
perspiration from -starting to flow un
der the hatband. It answered all finan-
. A ..freichtcar -load Â¦ of coin was

.Two rank outsiders, Criss Cross and
El Piloto. fou&ht it out for the third
purse. Jimmy Coffoy's Ocyrohe on form
looked far and away the best of the
â¢Â¦even starters, and from 7 to 5 the
colt's edds were forced down to
11 to 10.. Crosswaite furnished a slov
enly ride, and the favorite was for
tunate to . get the show.'; After First
Chip had shot his,; bolt Criss Cross, a
15 to 1 /shot,'- with" Dugan in the saddle,
won from El Piloto by less than a
length in a driving finish." WigginB, a
well-backed one. played in poor racing
luck.- ' . " ' \/ V - .,
There was a liberal sprinkling of out
siders again, Canejo, Criss Cross and
Colonel Van paying their respects at
most advantageous quotations. Wager
and Our .Bessie endeavored to uphold
the prestige of the favorites.
Among: others, Flaneur and St. Wlnnl
fride ducked the issue in the intro
ductory six-furlong sprlnU This left,
W.ager, n winner of the day previous,
to ro to the post a 3 to 2 favorite.
The only one. to give. the Wagner geld
ing an argument was the 20 to 1 shot
Modder, which was .-finally beaten out
nearly a length. Nullah closed strong
ly, losing the place by a, neck. Nanon
looked dangerous to the stretch, where
she began falling back. , /
Canejo made such an indifferent show
ing On Wednesday, though, of course,
mixed up with better horses, that ii(
the betting on the mile and 100 yards
event the mare received but little con
sideration. Th6 price about her drift

something, and couldn't run fasi
enough to raise a scrape, finishing un
placed. Harry "".Stover's "Illowaho". led
into the- stretch; where 'he. .began to
falter,, ond ran an indifferent third.
CRISS CROSS A WINNER.
THREE OUTSIDERS LAND.
The favorite, never a fast heginner,
laid away in fourth position, while Hy
ron Rose and' Illilouon shaped up the
early running. Jones made his move
on the stretch turn, and less than a
furlong from home had Eessie in front,
and everything looked bright and
cheerful. -Suddenly, like all of his ilk.
Grafter, with Crosswalte up. made a
"quick lamb," and was beaten out but
a head, both riders driving hard. By
ron Rose finished third and Veterano

champions broke the winning streak
of Tacoma to-day and took their first
pime of the series by the score of 3

inning and the decisive run was scored
with one man out. It was a fast, close
game. Had Overall been given good'
support the Tigers would have made
ii five straight. The big pitcher was
.In fine form and allowed but five hits.
Costly errors, however, principally
poor throwing by Eagan. probably
los"t the game. Wheeler pitched a
great game and was backed up well by
the fielders. With the score one all
at the end of the eighth Tacoma made
one in the ninth and Los Angelos went
to bat needing two runs. A base on

hits in succession brought victor}' to

Toledo was a starter in the conclud

first time with the colors up of his
new owner, Ed. Gaylord, the well
known turfman. The colt. opened fa
vorite, but was evidently not up to a
bruising race, for his price receded to
threes. Ridden by Joe Jones he ran
a good third, after getting away none
too well. li. V. Frank and Whoa Bill
outbroke the others and had the race
between them all the .way. Although
tiring badly and growing wobbly. Du
gan kept . the former, going long
enough to be awarded a nose decision
over Bill.
Seattle was never through and you
could not tell just when they would
become busy with that club, fill up
the sacks and then when the 'right
sort of a wallop came through some
one would run for the plate while th2
Oakland fielders would do all kinds
of hotfoots after trie elusive, sphere.
Seattle got In wrong in the first
round and it did not look any too
bright for the' Northern stickers.
Ganley took a safe clout at the ball
and Francks was hit by Williams.
Kruger forced Ganley at third, but
Schally hit safe enough. With the
bases full Williams hit Streib* and
forced Francks over the rubber.
For three rounds Seattle could not
understand Schmidt. Their vision be
came beautifully clear in the fourth.
Mohler was safe on Schafly's miscue
and Smith hit. Both advanced on
Frisk's out and both arrived when
Mr. Hall punched out to the outfield.
Hall lingered but a short while, for
Brashear's double bag clout landed
him. Delehanty happened along with
one at the same time, which brought
Brash home.
Oakland had a holdout .which was
sprung in the same round. Streib and
Devereaux both coaxed bases on balls.
Streib tore through on Lohman's dou
ble to left. Blankenship neglected to
pick up Francks* bunt and Devereaux
skipped in. Lohman scooted to the
rubber and tied ur> the result when
Kruger tore off a good one to the
right garden.
" It looked Eood for a close finish to
the seventh. -Then Seattle broke it
up. Six runs resulted from the bat
ting streak. Every one took a ride on \
that ball and before It came to be a
thing of the past six of the gray
shirted warriors landed. It was an
awful slaughter and seemed to please
the crowd. Oakland -never -had an
other chance after'.'the fourth, for Wil
liams pitched good, steady baseball as
the game increased with age;

Scott took his charge to the City
Hall and turned him over to Steward
E. H. Manville, who placed the boy in
one of the cells provided for the
youthful prisoners. Manville closed
the door and securely fastened the
heavy spring lock. About twenty min
utes later, while. sitting in the outer
office, his attention was attracted by a
noise in the corridor and upon in
vestigating he found Kelly disappear
ing through the door.
The steward gave chase for several
blocks, but the lad was too fleet of
foot and made his escape. The. lock
on the cell door was found on the
floor, broken in half, and it is a mat
ter" of conjecture^ how the youthful
prisoner accomplished this. Â¦
Kelly resided with, his parents at
Gough and Hayes 'streets. ,. : lf: -
The lad has been on probation from
the juvenile court, but failed to re
port to Judge Murasky as is required.
Miss Stebbin3, the probation officer,
was notified and took the lad into cus

on the way to the City Hall and man
aged to elude the vigilance of the po
lice until last night, when Officer Scott

The committee appointed by the

arrangements for the great Gaelic
dancing contest to be held in the Al
hambra Theater on Friday and Satur

Thursday evening. The entertainment
will be thoroughly Irish in character,

ic, songs by the O'Carolan Choral So
ciety of Oakland, and an address on the
Gaelic revival will be delivered by the
Rev. P. C. Yorke, State president of
the Gaelic League.
The main feature of the evenings will
be the contest for the Gaelic dancing
championship of the Pacific coast; val
uable prizes will be awarded the best
dancers. As a number of well-known
Irish dancers all over the Pacific coast
have signified their intention to com
pete for the coast championship, it is

That done, let every, accredited man
and woman in the convention lend
best efforts to promote proceedingsâ
not to retard them. Constructionists,
not obstructionists, make for success.
Let any wisps of sectionalism that
might chance to blow in be cast igno
miniously into the sea, and let us stand
together, from north, south, east and
west, primarily as Californians. With
that spiritâ and that spirit alone con
stitutes patriotism, the other'provin
cialismâwill the greatest movement
yet to be put forth in California for the
public good be started well on its way.
And thus is it that now on the eve
of the Camino Real convention, which
might as logically, if not picturesquely,
go on record as a good roads conven
tion, no "croaker" has raised voice to
say "It ain't practical."
When that. convention, whereat the
gavel will fall at 2 p. m. on Tuesday,
takes upon itself a permanent person
ality and uhdertakesHo shape a policy
for royal roads through our bloom
blest State, at that moment will "love
of State" assume a- meaning that
stands for something. Patriotism is
all bombast unless we prove our love
of native 'land by acts â acts. And now
is the. hour' at hand for every Cali
fornlan to prove up on. his claim of
patriotism.
Let every delegate from Del Norte
to San Diego n make a mighty effort
to reach Santa Barbara for that his
tory-making convention.
We Californians have* a fashion
every time we run afoul pt an East
ern visitor of forthwith .Indulging in
the vierv laudable pursuit of setting
forth '.the multifarious virtues of our
State-v-sometimes, alas, with more
enthusiasm than accuracy. However,
on the grounds of patriotism, a di
version from stupid facts is not so
sheollc a crime. Indifference to State
growth is worse and so should be
classed apathy toward State improve
ments, .because perchance they lie not
at our own doorsteps, and obstruction-
Ism generally. These form the bulk
of that far-famed army of Cali
fornians, the "Knockers," ,\vho, by the
agency; of divine and human laws,
have been largely eliminated by death,
absorbed by education or silenced by
shame,' and therefore are we forging
forward.
The delegates from San Francisco
will leave for the old mission town on
the 6:45 o'clock' coast line train, Third
and Townsend streets, Monday night,
arriving in Santa Barbara Tuesday
morning. In addition to the six dele
gates appointed from the executive
committee of the ! allied commercial
bodiesâ James D. Phelan, Andrea: Sbar
boro, L. D. Lane, Mrs. Lillian Fergu
son, Thomas H. Varney and Mrs. Laura
Bride Powersâ the following delegates
have been appointed by Miss Flnkel
dey, grand president of the Native
Daughters of the Golden West! Laura
J. Frakes, grand secretary; Ema Gett,
past grand president; C. K. Witte
meyer, past grand president;. Emma G.
Foley, grand treasurer; Mrs. j Andrew
Hill; Arina Stirling, grand trustee;
Eva Bussenius, grand marshal, and
Cora B. Siftord, past grand president.
From the Daughters of California
Pioneers, Miss Eliza D. Keith will go
asVthe appointee of Mrs. Sydney S.
Palmer, president. Mrs. Caroline
Rickey Olney, who has done much
valiant service toward crystallizing .in
terest in the work, has been appointed
one of ' the delegates from the State
Federation of Women's Clubs by Mrs.
George *TLaw Smith; so, too, has Mrs.
A. S. C. Forbes of Los Angeles, who,
perhaps, more than any other woman
in the south, save Miss Anna B.
Pitcher, has helped to bring results
out of vague vaporings. The Trustees
of Alameda County have appointed
State Senator Joseph R. Knowland to
represent the district over the bay.
Now, here's a thing worth noting â
behold a convention wherein the dele
gates are not all men; nor yet are they
all women. Now, conventions of either
sex are profuse as ' cherry blossoms,
but here's one wherein both are ac
credited â the very first on record. It
remains to be seen who does the most
talkingâ likewise, who will say the
most. Of course, we all have our pre
arranged opinions! Tuesday at 2
p. m., at Santa Barbara.
Then comes the ,. opportunity of the
voters of the State; when the conven
tion shall h'ave adjourned, to take up
the : work in their own ; counties and
push it along with. vigor. To be sure,
the restoring of El Camino Real and its
subsidiary roads cannot be done in a
month, nor yet in a year; but let us
have a beginning, a big, vigorous, mo
mentous beginning.

\h$ Two severe cases of Ovarian Trouble â¢
and two terrible operations avoided. Mrs.
Emmons and Mrs, Coleman each tell
how they were saved by the use of
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
"Dear Mrs. Ptxeiiam :â I am so pleased with the results obtained
from Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound that I feel it a duty
and a privilege to write you about it.
"I suffered for more than five years with ovarian troubles, caus-
ing an unpleasant discharge, a great weakness, and at times a faintness
would come over me which no amount of medicine, diet, or exercise
seemed to correct Your Vegetable Compound found the weak spot,
however, within a few weeks â and saved me from an operation â
all my troubles had disappeared, and I found myself once more healthy
and welL Words fail to describe the real, true, grateful feeling that is
m my heart, and I want to tell every sick and suffering sister. Don't
dally with medicines you know nothing about, but take Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound, and take my word for it, you will be a
different woman in a short time." â Mrs. Lauka Eiimons, Walker-
rille, Oat. â¢ â¢

It is well to rememember such letters as above when some drug-gist tries
to get you to buy something 1 vrhich he says is " just as good " That is impos-
Bible.^as no other medicine has Buch a record of cures as Lydia E. Pink-
ham s \ egetable Compound ; accept no other and you will be glad.
Don't hesitate to write to Mrs. Pinkham if there is anything
about your sickness you do not understand. She will treat you
with kindness and her advice is free. No woman erer regretted
writing her and she has hejped thousands. Address Lynn, Mass.

to meet* the drafts thereon and should
the number of annuitants' increase it
will be found impossible to pay -'them
even, the $63 a quarter. .,
Attempts have been made to, provide
means to enrich the fund, but thus far,
without success. City Attorney. Long
rendered, an opinion that an act of
the Legislature would be necessary; to
compel teachers to pay $2 a month In
stead of $1 Into the: fund, an -amount
that would meet all demands on the
fund. This must be done at the next
session of the Legislature if relief Is to
be had. v
A former School Director, is author
ity for the statement that at least
fifty teachers -would resign their posi
tions in the Public School Department
should they be guaranteed the full pay
ment of annuities as provided by law.
There are at present thirty-nine an
nuitants receiving the benefits of the
fund. The. expenditures for the last
quarter were $2403 75 and - demands
were drawn on the City Treasurer for
the segregated. annuities

PROGRESS OP BUILDING. -
RECENT SUBSCRIPTIONS.
The Merchants' Asaoclatlon of San
Francisco has contributed X1000 to
thÂ» fund for the San Francisco build-
In* and exhibit at the St. Louis â¢ Ex
position. This, with the J1000 given
by the Board of Trade of San â¢ Fran
cisco and the 115,000 contributed by
the city, together with the ajims sub
scribed by private citizens, brings the
total up to date to $35,000. There Is
a shortage of something like. $8000
yet, but the,- finance committee of the
general San Francisco committee,
representing all the- commercial or
ganizations of the city, Is of the opin
ion that the remaining sum requisite
will be given.
News that the Merchants' Associa
tion had donated $1000 was given out
yesterday. This breaks all donation
records of the association. It was
prompted by the fact that San Fran
cisco is virtually to be placed on ex
hibition at St. Louis and any failure
to make a creditable showing would
certainly create an unfavorable im
pression abroad concerning the enter
prise and public spirit of the people.
In addition to the subscriptions men
tioned sums have been contributed re
cently by private and others
as follows:

islature Is Passed at Once

According to private letters from St.
Petersburg, there is much talk there
again about the activity of the "Holy
League," which was founded during
the reign of Alexander III to protect
the sacred person of that monarch from
the weapons of his secret enemies in
the ranks of the Nihilists, or even the
mallgnants of his court. Its author
was M. ; Besobrasoff, 'an ex-guardsman,
who Is now supposed to exercise a
paramount Influence over the wfll of
Nicholas II. The "Holy League" was
composed of all kinds of people in high
position, and its object was to spy out
intrigue against the Czar, as well as
to, shield his person. On succeeding to
the throne Nicholas II would not hear
of it, but now he appears to have In
voked Its assistance, and that is why
its organizer, M. Besobrasoff, is once
more In the ascendant.â London Daily
Chronicle.

exposure in Wayne nine years ago to

in the morgue of S. P. Frankenfleld's
Sons at Ardmore.

by R. ; H. . Johnson, a â¢ contractor of
Wayne. He was a man of education
and culture, and, to rumor,
was.the.helr to a British title, 'which,
for some mysterious \ reason, he would
not or could not claim.
When the man died J. S. Pearce, at
that time an undertaker, but who has
since retired, embalmed the body, and
decided to hold it; until it should be
claimed. No one ever claimed it, and,
as the embalming was unusually suc
cessful, a number j of efforts have been
made by museums to purchase the
body, but Mr. Pearce says he will not
surrender it except to some member of
Mack's family.
The body v has been viewed bv thou

"THE LOTTERY OF LOVE"
AT LIBERTY THEATER
Several people who witnessed the
accident agree that the motorman was
in no way to blame for the occur
rence, as they say that the car was
only, a few feet away when the little
girl, confused by the approaching
team, in on the track. She
was rolled for several feet in front of
the car before it was brought. to a
stop .and the lower part of her body
was caught beneath the '.' .< fender,
though the wheels did not touch her.
Bystanders went to the assistance of
the motorman and conductor and the
little one was extricated from beneath
the car; and taken to the office of .Dr.
J. B. Wood at the corner of Sixtieth
street and San â¢ Pablo avenue.'- The
doctor made an examination, but
could find no signs of injury except a
few minor bruises, and the child was
removed to the home ofj her parents
and put to bed.
Several times in the night she com
plained of violent- pains. in the head,
but as no injury was visible the doctor
â¢thought she was suffering more from
.the shock than from actual injury.
During the early morning she seemed
to improve and talked rationally to
her mother, but about 10 o'clock she
suddenly grew worse and although the
doctor was at once summoned he waii
unable to rouse the â¢*.Â« little, one from
the stupor Into which she had sunk
and she passed' away. ; x
The shock was a terrible one to her
mother, who is on th'e verge' of nerv
ous prostration. \
The case was reported to the Cor-^
oner and an inquest will -.he held. No
arrangements have yet been made for
the funeral. , .
.The,. accident 11 happened while the
little girl was on her way to a. nearby
store on an errand for her mother.
She was riding a bicycle and had just
turned the corner of Fifty-eighth
street, riding north on San Pablo ave
nue, when in avoiding : a team that
was coming rapidly toward her she
turned directly in front of car No. 164,
southbound, and., before Motorman J.
C. Oronin, could stop the child had
been struck. -

Crushed to Death
by Fender. .
An old retired whaler who lives, by
the Ladd. tract,, where the gulls most
do congregate to hunt for earthworms,
etc., has an idea of capturing and con
fining a lot of them and keeping them
to produce eggs for market. .'He had
visited; the Arctic regions, on both -this
coast and the. east coast, and has seen
whole schoonerioads of j eggs of gulls
and .other/ seagoing .birds gathered
about Labrador, in the Farallon Islands
and on the coast of Alaska and sent to
market. He" has' many a time feasted
on omelet of gulls' eggs, which find
ready: sale In many markets. . He says
theyare-not so delicate as hens' eggs,
having a slight tinge* of a fishy taste,
but they are wholesome and nutritious
and are much better than no eggs at
all, which of .late has formed a part of
his breakfast very often.. He believes
that if the gulls were kept here in con
finement awhile and properly fed their
eggs would be as good as hens' eggs
and much larger. Gulls are great pro
ducers, of eggs, as he has seen miles of
land and rocks covered with them. He
proposes to fence In a piece of land
along a slough, including. a section of
the slough, and to confine there as
many gulls as ' he can " procure, and
imagines that In a little while they will
become tame ahd can be treated the
same as barnyard fowls.â Portland Ore

determined .struggle with the. high
wayman succeeded Â¦ in escaping from
his clutches., Spanos' watch and chain
were pulled from his vest by the rob

that ensued and later recovered by the
owner.
Spanos and his young brother, Mi
chael Spanos, were returning from the
circus that showed ' at i)\e corner of
Clement avenue and Walnut street!
As the pair were walking on Park ave
nue/toward Central avenue, the foot
pad' stepped out from behind a tree
near the sidewalk and with an oath
commanded the elder Spanos to yield
up some money, at the same time
snatching his victim's watch, chain
and fob.' Spanos and his brother
yelled for assistance dnd offered fight
to the footpad, who, scared by the out
cry, ran toward Santa Clara avenue,
dropping Spanos' watch in his flight.
Spanos and his brother are unable
to give a reliable description of the
highwayman. It is supposed that the
footpad came to Alameda .with the
circus and left here the same way.

"THE PASSING STORM."
Two favorite themes furnish subjects for the brush of Thomas Moran. N. A . the
artificial architectural beauty, of Venice and the grandeur of American Â«*Â°Â«Â» ea P^*
"The Passing Storm." which was painted on Long . Island, furnlehes one of thÂ« most
beautiful and effective colored reproductions yet published. It Is -vigorous ana yei
harmonious in color, dramatic In effect and well balanced In Its composition, tm
warm color of autumn browns and ytllow contrasts with gray roc*s ana rne ncn
greens of the swampy foreground, and above all is a sky full of movement and y^rlea
in Us colored effects. â¢ - .. . â¢ .
It is the emotional qualities in this, a* well aa In nearly all of Mr. Moran s paint-
ings, which have contributed much to their success, and yet underlying these there is
a foundation of convincing realism. . Â¦ ' , . ' .
In "The Passing Etorra" it may bÂ« seen that the elements which make up the pic-
ture are reproduced with remarkable fidelity to nature, but at the same time by a
sapient arrangement of masses of light and dark oppositions of brilliant and sub-
dued color, of broad, simple masses and Intricate detail, the artist reflects his own
poetic temperament in Its dramatic effect, wealth of color and technical abUlty.
Mr. Mor&n's attention was first attracted to the possibilities of American land-
scape In 1S71. when he accompanied the Cnited State* Oovernment expedition under Ma-
jor Powell to explore the Yellowstone country. His large paintlnr of thÂ« â¢'Grand Canyon
of the Yellowstone." which was produced shortly. after, was purchased by the Govern- m
ment. The painting is so truthful that geologists are able to detect and classify from J
it the thousands of f*et of canyon wall, and yet the expression of a feeling of subllm- r
Ity is so strong that it is difficult to believe that he has not Idealized his subject.
He has since mads several trips to the Rocky Mountain* and haa visited Cuba
and Mexico, and it may be truthfully tald that no artist has don* more to make
known to the world the splendors of American landscapes, whose artistle possibilities
he was one 'of the first to appreciate. . _
Thomas Moran, who is sometimes called the American Turner, was bora in Bol-
ton. Lancashire. England. In 1837. Went to Philadelphia with his parent* at the age
of 7.- He began his artistic career as a wood engraver's apprentice and was made an
associate of the National Academy In 1882 and academlclar. in 1884. HÂ« Is a mem-
ber of the Society of American Artists and the Pennsylvania. Academy. > v
"TREASURED MEMORIES."
Not all of the garlands of war are of laurel and palm, there "are others
of withered and bitter leave* which do not crown the victors or repose - ett %hÂ»

picture, "Treasured Memories." - â¢ ââ¢"-''â¢ â Â¦
It depicts an'' aged mother honoring the memory of a son fallen on a Southern
battlefield, by bringing out his rusty saber and time-worn unlfcrm to ptacs them
in the chair he used to tit in as a boy, while she Â»e-rÂ«adÂ» tbe letters whose con-,
tents she knows by heart. - - â¢ -
It Is thus on the anniversary of bis d-jath and Decoration day sn* performs
silently and alone what to her -ha* become the ceUbration of a' sacred rite. â¢ Th*
picture is one full of human Interest and sentiment strongly expressed. - It ts!>*
it* story simply and directly and at the same time it possesses artistic qualities
of a high order. It is admirably composed, effective, pleasing In color and care-
fully elaborated in its details. Â¦ - . Â¦
Edgar 8. Cameron, the artist who has painted this picture, is one of tbe most,
prominent Dainter. of figure compositions In the West. Few men have thÂ« ability
to paint well to many . different Â¦ classes of subjects as he. 1>n years ago cÂ« was
painting military subjects, on* of which received honorable mention In the Yerkes
prlie competition. Then followed decoration for the World's Fair. The largest can-
vas he has "painted Is a religious subject. "The Youth of Christ." now loaned toÂ«*Ji
the Union League Club of Chicago. Two yean ago he exhibited a striking â¢ pictur-
of glaasblowers at work In the red light of a blow furnace. This was purchase!
by the Chicago Woman's Aid Club. At the Chicajro Artists' Exhibition this year he
showed an Important marine painting "The Volceful 8ea." whksh wa* painted
while the artist was t returning from Paris last year, where he served a* a mem-
ber of the international Jury of the exposition of 1900. This plctnr* was pur-
chased by the Arche Club. Â¦
Besides Â« painting these and countless genre and landscape subjects, Mr. Cam-
eron has found time to contribute occasionally articles on art to art publications
and to act aa Instructor at the Art Academy. As early as 1888 h* was an exhib-
itor in the Paris Salon. . ; ;- â¢â¢ .
"IN THE PASTURE." ; â¢..-,-
"In th* Pasture." by Julien Jos, presents a rare combination of ptctortaJ and
artistic qualities. In It the artist ha s displayed exceptional ability In three direc-
tions â as a landscaptst. a figure painter and an animal painter. His varied talents
. are so evtnly balanced and so harmoniously combined In this picture that It would
be a difficult matter to decide which be has painted best â the cattle, the young
peasant woman who is caring for their wantr, or the landscape, which sÂ«rv*s a* a
setting for both. It- has other qualities which are not the result of the artist's skill
as a painter, but which are th* ; expression of his thought and feeling.
There is a vigor and brilliancy to bÂ« observed in the effect of sunlight, and h*
has given a vivacity to the movements of the animals and the action of the figure.
In the grass and foliage of the lane'seape there Is abundant detail, but it !â¢
painted with a frank, sure touch, free from any â¢uggestlon of labored uncertainty in
his methods of painting. AU this combines to give in tbe picture an agreeable effeot
of truth and llfellkeness. . â¢ ' â¢ . - Â¦-.-Â¦â¢
The cattle are particularly 'wail drawn *nd painted.
It has been said that pictures of horses are less ant to pleas* than representa-
, tlons of cattle or sheep, for the reason that horse* are generally more closely ob-
served by the public, and defects In th* drawing of the** animals are more quickly
noted, while in paintings of cattle su ch defects are overlooked, provided there Is . . .
agreeable color and a picturesque Quality of roughness. In the paintlnr to* conceal I
them. - ' Â¦ . ' Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦" t '
- In this painting by Julien Jos ther* has been no attempt to avoid difficult!**. - i
Forms are welt defined, values are truthful- and colors well . observed. Then Is evt- -â¢
dence everywhere of the artist's comprehennive study, from' the blades ' of grass in '
tbe foreground to details of the figure and the animals. ' ' -* '
There is a satisfying sense of com plateness, and y*t he haa shown bow to sub-
ordinate parts of his picture to gain unity of subject.
It. Is scientific rather than emotional painting, and yet is not lacking In tteltng
and spirit. .:, â¢ . â¢ -
Julien Jos Is a native of Belgium- and has his studio in Brussels. He is a pupil
of the celebrated cattl* painter, Franz dÂ« Beul. and is, to some extent, a follower.
, of Julien Dupre. ... . 1 - ' .
. He was awarded a stiver medal at the Brussels Universal Exposition, and m*da!s
at exhibitions held' in Ghent. Antwerp and other Buropean cities. His work is almost
as well known and appreciated In America as in Europe. ,
"COSTLY TOYS."
"Costly Toy*" is the title of the art supplement, by Charles Van den Eycken.
The Â¦ proverbial playfulness of s kittens Is. a favorite subject, with painters who
choose their models , from the domesticated branch* of tbe feline -tribe The- fact
' that the little . animal* have not been endowed with discretion in . their choice of
playthings, along with their Instinct for play, often leads' them to Â¦ do much mis-
chief, ' and It Is this mischief which furnishes an inexhaustible Â¦ fund of mate-
rial upon which such artists as Eugene Lambert. Mme. Henriette' Ronner and
Charles Van' den Eycken. the painter of the original of this art supplement, hav*
Â¦drawn. In producing the picture* which are . their . lifework. - Â¦ ; - ,.-â¢
OthÂ£r artist* of more serious temperament have used cats as models for rep-
resentations of - the savac* members of the same family. The anatomy of thÂ« do-
mestic cat Is almost Identical with that of many ot Its wild cousins, and the fact
that the ravage instincts of its ancestors have only a thin veneer of .< the denwÂ«tl-
catlon makes it a simple matter for an artist to transform thÂ« household tabby into
a tlÂ«rÂ»r or lioness, . as Delacroix frequently did. One needs only to â¢observe a cat
drinking, eating or ' stalking a mouse or sparrow to note the resemblance recalled
by, Whlttler,. who displayed- much of a painter's instinct In his description. In the
lines In "Snow - Bound" : "The cat's dark silhouette en the wall, "a couchant -timer's
seemed to fall.". .. v '"
Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ In ' such ' pictures as the one which Is the subject' of "this notice there "are the
" elements of ' lively action, and a pleasing suggestion of Innocence and ' Joyousness
which make them Justly popular. In Van -den Eycken's painting there Is also
bright and agreeable color and : skillful brush work |lF Â¦
~ Charles Van den Eycken is a Belgian of pure Flemish descent. He Is still Â§
a young . man. and has every prospect of becoming even more famous In hi* chosen
branch . of art than the celebrated . Mme.* Ronner. who*e pupil he is. Hit studio Is
in Antwerp, in the same building as that of hi.* farmer, instructor. During the last
decade his works have become well known In America.' and . tbe sale of hiÂ» pictures
' In this country is steadily increasing.
"THE BIRTHDAY." < 17
Cora .Fredericka Freer* s ; painting. "The Birthday." was the most important
figure composition exhibited by a Chicago artist at the recent exhibition of \mer-
. lean oil painting and sculpture at the Art Institute. It Is the work which com-
I bines. the telling of a pleasing story wJth the successful renderlnc of a most inter-
' estln* effect of artificial lighting. The four flickering tapers on the birthday cake
Illuminate the scene, which Is one of tenderness and Intensity as well as of , fes-
tivity. Â¦ * ' . . , '
The costumes of. the little girl In whose honor the celebration Is mad* hep
young mother and her comrade and guest furnish notes of colors, and the olav of
the.warra glow from the tapers on these" offers a problem which the artist 'has
solved most atfreeably. "*â¢''â¢"" ''-'(Z 1 -. Â¦'< â¢> â¢ .-,-
The expression on the faces of the participants in the pretty fete shows that
she Is also a â¢ close student of character. A smile of love and contentment plays
over the features of the mother, as she ctjts the cake: the little one looks on *Â»'lth
something of ; curiosity t and wonderment in her Joy, while a lcok-of satlent ex-
pectancy plays over the features of her ruest. .Â¦-â¢Â¦â¢â¢..

CHICAGO. April 16.â A bearish mood from
the start In wheat was induced by lower
cables and an official forecast of showers and
warmer tempeartures for Kansas. July opened
unchanged to He lower at S6%c to 67c. Offer
ings were quite liberal and. apparently there
wa B little Inclination to support the market.
The desire to sell was Increased by Kansas
State reports, which made the condition cf
winter wheat S3, compared with 78. _as re
ported from Washington. Although advices
from Indiana, Michigan and Ohio were In
sistent resardlxur the seriousness of crop darn
age In those States the traders seemed dU
inclined to pay heed. An Impression appeared
fixed that prevailing prices more than dis
counted any damage to the crop as a whoie.
There was little other news of a character
to encourage the bulls and In consequence long
wheat continued to come out during the entire
day. From 87>4c July gradually declined to
Â£6Hc The close was weak, with July at
&CÂ«Â»Â©S6iÂ±c. May sold between Â»2c and JC&c
and closed at 02 He
Cold weather throughout the West caused
a fair demand for corn at - the opening and
In consequence the market was comparatively
firm considering the easier tone in wheat. But
sentiment soon changed and prices started
downward. Considerable July corn was for
eale and it came out in such volume as to
suggest liquidation of some heavy holders.
There w as also selling for short account, In
spired by predictions of more favorable weather
for planting. The market showed no recuper
ative powers, -ruling weak the remainder of
the day. After opening He to Uc higher to
50Hc to '50Uc, July sold between 49%c and
fcftiic and closed at 49?;c. May closed at
G13ic.
Oats withstood the weakness of other grains
for a time, but In the end succumbed to per
sistent selling by some of the heavy longs.
The market was Quite firm early, due to un
favorable weather conditions and strength In
cash oats. As the session advanced weakness
developed and the close was near the bottom.
July opened a shade to HJUc higher, at
3-SHc to 3S'.ic. sold between 37Hc and 3SV4c
acd closed at 37>4c.
Provisions were weak from the start under
the Influence of moderate selling by commis
sion houses and pit traders. Weakness 111
grains and lower prices for hogs were the
main causes of the liquidation. The market
closed at the low point, with July pork down
17Vic. lard off 10c and ribs 7H@10c lower.

The stockholders of the Oroville
Gold Dredjring- and Exploration Com
pany, who have been fighting bitterly
in the local courts for control of that
property, held their annual meeting
at the offices of the corporation in the
Crocker - building yesterday. John
Hays Hammond. Ernest A.. Wiltsee
and their financial associates in New-
York and Chicago, who -were ad
versed last "week by Judge Sloss in
an attempt to enjoin F. W. Bradley.
Charles Crocker and others from vot
ing 40,000 shares of stock, which it
was claimed the latter were wrong
fully holding, were represented at the
meeting by J. E. Doollttle and Attor
ney. Jesse Lillenthal. The opposing
faction was also represented by legal
advisers, under whose direction the
meeting progressed. Bradley presided
and was kept bu3y listening to formal
protests .to every move made by the
majority of the stockholders, who
Â¦were represented mainly by proxies
held by the president It was evi
dent that the Hammond faction in the
company will not rest on the ruling
made by Judge Sloss and that Attor
ney . Lilienthal's frequent protests on
behalf of his clients was a, preliminary
move to a civil action which the latter
have threatened to bring to overcome
the barrier placed before them by the
recent decision. At the election of of
ficers Bradley was re-elected president
of the company and two of his busi
ness associaTes, G. W. Goodwin and
Alexander Granger, were chosen as
directors. The minority secured two
places on the board, naming as their
choice Doolittle and Lillenthal. John
Hays Hammond and a party of cap
italists Interested in the company are
expected in this city in a few weeks
and. will, so it is reported, proceed to
court in" another attempt to remove
Bradley and his followers from con
trol of the mining property. -

of little value when the mind Is troubled â

class clairvoyant reading. He asks you no
questions, but tells you what you wish to

President Wheeler said education
niust confer health of body aa well as
health of mind. It must not be thought
that education belongs to only one
peripd of life, <jr exclusively to Â¦ the
schools and universities. He said Oxer*
Is so much to be learned about agri
culture that no one can possibly take
all Its branches in the college course.
He dwelt upon the growing needs of
the college of agriculture at Berkeley,
eajlng there are five times a? many
agricultural students as there were
live years azo.
President "Wheeler was loudly ap
plauded when, in conclusion, he as
rured the institute that the university
was earnestly desirous of promoting
agriculture in this State.
Irland he was obliged to llrten to a se
ries of lectures on cows, and he learned ,
enough of the different breeds to secure
a renewal of his scholarship. The
farmers at that time, eaid President'
Wheeler, used to have faith in the al- j
xn&nacs that gave instruction to plant ;
eeeds in accordance with the changes Â¦
of the moon. ]

In Japan the nose is the only feature
which attracts attention. The nose de
termines the beauty, or ugliness of. the
face, according as it is big or small.
This is probably " due " to the fact j that
difference in noses constitutes about
the only distinction between one Japa
nese face and another. The eyes are
invariably black, the cheek bones high
and the chin receding. In -Japan a
woman who has a huge proboscis is al
ways a great beauty ' and a reigning
belle. There are a few large noses
among the natives, and lucky is he or
she -upon whom, nature Â¦; lavishes one.
In all Japanese pictures â¢ representing
the supposedly beautiful ' woman : the
artist invariably improves on nature
by. depicting this feature as abnormally
developed.- - > . . ,
