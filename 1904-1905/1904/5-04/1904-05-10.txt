"WASHINGTON, May 9.â Just before
the "loop the gap" act of Barnum &
Bailey's .circus came on this afternoon
a severe wind and rain storm suddenly
arose, and for a moment there was a
small-sized panic among the 10,000 peo
ple in the big tent. President Roose
velt's children, Ethel and Archie, ac
companied by maids and the White
House, coachman, occupied a box di
rectly in the center of the tent cind for
a time were surrounded by hurrying
crowds of people pressing down from
the seats above, j All in the box, how
ever, kept cool, and among those who
seemed have the least fear were the
President's children themselves.
' The wind blew a gale for five or six
minutes and the bit? show tent was
filled with dust and sawdust from the
streets and surrounding grounds. The
big poles buckled, but stood the strain.
Many women and children -- became
frightened and there was a general
rush for the exits. The circus attend
ants and, city . policemen prevented | ex
treme ' disorder and not a . single mis
hap was recorded. After the wind sub
sided rain came down in torrents and
the spectators again rushed back to
the tent where," after a brief, suspen
sion, the show was resumed. Instead
of being frightened, the President's
children seemed to \ enjoy the incident
and /the excitement" did not detract
from their, afternoon's pleasure.

IN A PANIC
Captain Ferrera and his officers held
a council of war. It was determined
to kill the tarantulas and centipeds
by fumigating the hold. Thla was ac
cordingly done. The hatches then were
replaced and sulphur was allowed to
do its work. Later the hatches were
removed and dead insects were seen
on top of the cargo of bones.
"When the sailors went below they
discovered a horde of tarantulas and
centipeds prepared to give battle. As
the crawling enemy advanced to the
attack, the sailors prepared to repulse
them. They had armed themselves
with long, strong bones and with these
they fought and beat off tarantulas
and centipeds. It was a fight against
too heavy odds. The foe was too nu
merous. 'As fast as cne . tarantula
would be killed another would take It3
place.
In the battle not a few of the seamen
were nipped in the legs and were saved
from serious bites by the sea boots they
wore. Those sailors who were in the
hold of the bark soon became exhausted
and others of the crew took their
places. But they could not get rid of
their tenacious foes.
Then the fighting sailors clambered
out of the hold upon deck, leaving the
tarantulas complete victors. Some of
the tarantulas tried to follow the re
treating seamen, but as soon as they
showed themselves above the hatches
they were easily destroyed. After the
retreat of the sailors, the tarantulas
and centipeds again took refuge in the
bones.
PHILADELPHIA, May 9.â The Ital
ian bark Anlat Menoth arrived in port
to-night with a cargo of bones. When
the hatches were lifted and prepara
tions were made to unload the cargo,
the sailors had an experience that al
most turned their hair white.

Californians in New York.
NEW YORK, May 9. â The follow
ing Californians have arrived at the
hotels:
Harold T. Clarke was the son of Jere
miah Clarke, a lawyer, who died in this
city about fifteen years ago. At the
time of his father's death he became
heir to a considerable fortune, which the
latter had accumulated In real estate.
For some years he remained on the
coast, but he had a fancy for travel
ing and roamed over the northern
lands as well as the eastern section of
the country. He left San Francisco
for the' East about one year ago. After
spending some time in Detroit he went
to New York, where he devoted the
winter to studying law. Recently, as a
vacation, he Journeyed to Paris, where
his mother was. In addition to his
mother, he. leaves two sisters, Mrs.
Charles G. Lyman and. Mrs. Charlotte
Wright, and one brother, Edward H. j
Clarke, Who was much talked of a
short time ago by his marriage with
Rosalind Bower, known as the "Sweet j
Pea girl."
Captain Charles G. Lyman, the un
fortunate man's brother-in-law, when
seen last nisrht said: "Harold Clarke,
though not a quiet sort of man, never
Indulged in a strenuous life such as
would bring him to suicide. The dis
patches stated that he took his own
life and I presume they are correct,
although his mother did not mention
that fact in the ' message I received
from her. The- information i3 also
given but that he lost heavily at Mon
te Carlo. If hie did lose a . few thou
sand dollars it could not affect him
much, as his property is all v intact in
this city and he has not once since his
departure drawn on his income." ,The
only cause for suicide I could give
wduld be despondency."
Shortly after the news of Clarke's
death was received here Captain C. G.
Lyman, brother-in-law of the deceased,
filed an application -for' the appoint
ment of special â¢ administrator of. the
estate. Lyman's petition recites that
the application Is made upon the re
quest of Charlotte Clarke, the mother
of the decedent, and his only heir at
law. The other heirs are Edith Lyman,
wife of the petitioner, a sister; Char
lotte H. "Wright, another sister, and E.
K.Clarke, a brother.
; Clarke's estate, according to Lyman,
consists of realty and personal prop
erty that yields an income.of about $350
per. month. - , _ Â¦ r

the Russian force probably evacuated
that place during last night. Many had
already departed yesterday and those
remaining made no secret of their In

whatever at the forts where there are
still a few guns in position. Three
thousand bandits are camped outside
of the walls of Newchwang ready to be
gin looting at the moment the last of
the Russian soldiers have left the city.
There are many foreign camp follow

the Russians much trouble along the
railway between Newchwang and Muk

WIJU, May 1, via Seoul, May 8 (de
layed in transmission). â When the
early mists drifted from the Yalu
River this morning the Japanese in
fantry was disclosed lined up for bat
tle on the low, sandy island of Kin
teito, which is in front of Wiju. The
walls and towers of the city on the
hill, rising abruptly from the south
bank of the river and the nearest of
the three channels, were crowded with
Japanese and Korean spectators in an
ticipation of the forthcoming attack.
KInteito Island is hardly anything
more than the dry bed of the river. It
is a low, sandy plain, only a few feet
above the level of the water and with
out shrubbery or cover except on its
southern half.
The infantry lay, with stacked arms,
across the island, awaiting their work.
The soldiers were spread. out ln thin
black vliaes three miles long from a
point on the island opposite the village
of Chiullencheng on the west to a
point opposite the extremity of the
Tiger's Head on the east. The divis
ion of the Imperial Guards occupied
the center of the line, another division
was on the west and a third on the
east of the line.
The Tiger's Head forms a peninsula
projecting into the river almost par
allel to the south bank. The Japanese
division, which executed the flanking
movement from up the stream yester
day, with almost its full force pres
ent, was now on the sands north of
the Tiger's Head. Four field batteries
were behind the infantry, on its ex
treme flanks, concealed ln the shrub
bery. Two batteries began the action
by throwing: shells to the Martchuriari
side of the river for half an hpur, while
the sun was rising. They 'sprinkled
with shells the embankments whence
the Russian guns had been firing for
the past week, but no response was
forthcoming, and it looked as if the
Russians had removed their batteries
during the night. It seemed as if the
enemy had withdrawn entirely, as no
signs of life could be seen- on their
works.
JAPAXESE BEGIX APVAXCE.
Soon after 7 o'clock the Japanese be
gan to advance. The distance from the
Korean to the Manchurian bank of the
Yalu is about two miles. The Japanese
troops spread out in extended forma
tion as they went forward. When they
were a few hundred! yards from the
hills on the Manchurian ! side they
threw themselves prone on the ground
and began volleying. In the meantime
the Japanese batteries searched the
hills with shrapnel.
The Russians now could be seen at
intervals, where the road was exposed,
hurrying in small squads along the
hills. These exposed stretches of the
road made fine targets for the Japan
ese gunners. A fierce fire was concen
trated on one open space, ;half the
shrapnel thrown bursting over a small
area with wonderful precision. There
was a perfect shower of Tniff s of white
smoke at this place, and the observers
could see the work of an occasional
shell as it dug a great hole in the earth
and scattered quantities of rock.
Still the Russians remained- silent.
There was no answering fire from them
until the first Japanese line was within
a few hundred yards of the river bank,
then sharp volleys burst almost simul
taneously from several trenches and
the attacking Japanese found them
selves under a heavy and continuous
fire, at easy range, -from covered posi
tions high above them. They laid be
hind the sand hillocks, replying bravely
and hotly, to this fire, while their own
batteries pumped shells over their
heads.
The Japanese officers sat on their
horses or walked along their lines.
They were in no way sheltered or pro
tected. A few stretcher bearers coming
back to the field hospital indicated that
men were being wounded.
The Russian smokeless powder was
excellent. Its use made it impossible
for the Japanese to discover the exact
position of their enemy or to estimate
their numbers.
RUSSL'LXS IX RETREAT.
Soon after 8 o'clock the Russian fire
was largely silenced by the combined
artillery and infantry attack of the
Japanese, and parties of the enemy's
troops could be seen hurrying upward
over the mountain roads in retreat.
Two regiments of Japanese troops,
one directly opposite Wiju, and another
near a village on the west, ran to the
river, stopping to fire now and then
as they progressed, and giving shrill
cheers aB they hurried forward, which
echoed clearly over^_the plain. Their
formation was closer" than that kept
by British or American troops, and it
looked as though their losses must be
great. They waded the . river, ran
across the sands and climbed up the
steep rocky hillside like a swarm of
ants, their red and yellow cap-bands
gleaming in the sun. . ' . , '
One Japanese soldier in one of . these
regiments carried something white with
him. This was seen and it caused a
shout to go up that the Russians had
surrendered. But- upon reaching the
top of the first Russian trench, a
hundred yards up the hillside, this man
shook out a Japanese flag and waved
it to and fro.
STRUCK BY OWX SHELLS.
A storming party on the west siae of
t:.e advance mounted a hill command
ing the Russian retreat. Just as the
men were bunched thickly on the crest
of this hill two Japanese shells burst
among them. They had fallen short.
When the smoke cleared away a dozen
bodies could be seen lying where the
shells had exploded, and the remainder
of the storming. party .were clambering
down the hill to escape this unexpected
fire from their rear. J
The sound of the rifle firing soon
passed on over the hills as the Japan
ese pursued the retreating enemy. â¢ One
column of weary soldiers who., had
been almost two days without rest was
trudging down the river toward
Antung, where the Japanese gunboats
were shelling the Russian works. â¢ â¢.
At 9 o'clock a solitary soldier,
climbing ahead of his comrades, un
furled a huge Japanese flag \ on the
face of the topmost Russian fort, on. a
ridge 1000 feet above the j plainJ He
marched back and forth along the
parapet waving the banner,, and then,

Special Pispatch to The Call
WASHINGTON. May 9.â As a pre
en ution against rioting, which Is feared
in Newchwang between the time of the
Russian withdrawal and the Japanese
occupation, Rear Admiral Cooper, cora
mander-in-chief of the Asiatic squad
ron, has been ordered to send a cruiser
and a punboat to Chefu, the nearest
neutral port." At rhe Navy Department
it is assumed that he will carry out
these orders by dispatching the cruiser
Raleigh to Cfcefu, from Chemulpo, Ko
rea, and either the gunboat Helena or
the Wilmington from Wenchau. Their
commanders will place themselves in
touch with American Consul Miller and
stasd ready to protect American inter
ests there if necessary.
These orders were issued- after a con
ference to-day between President
Roosevelt and Secretary Hay. It was
evident that the department had some
Bdvfeea from the Orient and that it re
garded the situation at Newchwang as
apain dangerously uncertain.
The Helena lay in a mud dock at
Newchwang all last winter beside a
British gunboat. The two only left
after the river became free of ice and
it was evident that the Russian com
mander was embarrassed by their
presence. With the Russians out of
Newchwang this obstacle to their pres
ence disappears. Although the United
States is anxious not to offend either
of the belligerents, the presence of a
warship at Newchwang is advanta
geous for many reasons.
Not the least important of to-day'j
de\*elopments is the likelihood that
Chinese troops may now occupy New
chwan?, not as any act of war, but
with the purpose of preserving order.
That such a step may be taken by
China is understood to have been part
of the recent advices to the State De
partment, but it is regarded as a move
which will not take place until Russia
has finally evacuated Newchwang.
WASHINGTON*. May . 9. â Count
Cassini. the Russian Embassador, has

from a severe attack of hay fever. The

BAROX TALKS OP PLANS.
Minister Hayashi Believes Battle Will
Occur at Linorang.
L.ONDON. May 9. â Baron Hayashi,
the Japanese Minister here, looks for
the next engagement of the war to
take place at Liaoyang. He said to
day:
"General Kuroki probably is on the
march to that place and General Kuro
patkin should give battle there. In
deed, from the signs of concentration,
he may assume. the offensive. But for
his defeat at the Yalu River this
movement might be very dangerous.
Under the existing conditions, how
ever. General Kuroki ought to be able
to drive back General Kuropatkin. At
Liaoyang the Russians have a central
position and can strike either to the
left or right, an advantage they did
not enjoy when Newchwang had to be
defended. In the event of our occupa
tion of Newchwang we shall imme
diately appoint a civil administrator,
as we did at the time of the war with
China and open the port to all na
tions.
"Vice Admiral Togo, I think, is now
likely to dock part of his fleet and
give the men a rest from the ceaseless
vigil they have kept up since the be
ginning of the war. Our land advance
and parr of the impending engage
ments must largely depend upon the
commissariat. This I hardly think is
yet able to cope with a forward move
ment upon Mukden, Harbin or Vladi
vostok."

ments to the Front
ST. PETERSBURQ, May 9.â The re
inforcements prepared for General
Kuropatkin are beinc hurried. The
last Ftage of the mobilization of the
Tenth and Seventeenth Army Corps
has been signalized by the calling out
of the reserves in the Moscow and
Kharkort provinces. They will go to
the .front, thus placing another 100.000
men at Kuropatkin's disposal. The
announcement of the mobilization of
four army corps along the Volga,
which will follow in July or August,
is expected next month. The reserves
of each army corps involve 20,000 men.
an army corps in time of peace num
bering 20.<XÂ»0 and in war time &0.000.
An army corps on a war footing in
cludes three infantry divisions of four
regiments, each of three battalions;
a division of cavalry consisting of
three regiments of six squadrons each;
one Cossack regiment, a brigade of
field artillery and a brigade of horse
artillery of 120 gains and also three de
tachments of engineers and sappers.
By the departure of these troops the
Russian European army will lose six
out of thirty-one army corps. The pre
vious draft of troops from European
Russia has been formed into Siberian
rifle battalions, without changing the
organization of the Emperor's forces
"It is reported that a three days' ty
phoon greatly retarded the Japanese
landing at. Pitzewo.
LONDON, May 10.â The Daily Tele
graph's Toklo correspondent telegraph
ing under date of May 9 says:
"The Japanese have requested the
United States Government to inquire
into the fate of forty men who were
missing after the j blockading of Port
Arthur. It is believed that several of
them were captured.
-"It is reiterated that the â¢ Japanese
have occupied Dalny.
"I learn from trustworthy sources
that 'the Russians in the battle of the g
Yalu" lost over forty guns, enormous
quantities of war . material, horses,
carts, ammunition and equipment."
In the absence of further stirring
hews : from, the Far East, the London
newspapers are discussing the proba
ble course of events. The balance
of opinion inclines to the belief that
General Kuroki will succeed ln over
taking the Russians between Feng
wangcheng Â¦ and Liaoyang .and will
compel .them to flght at a disadvantage.
It is argued ' that it will be impossi
ble for_General Kuropatkin, depending
upon a slender line of * railway, ' and
with his army encumbered with bag
gage,- to make his retirement, speedy
enough to enable him to choose his
own ground for battle. On the other
hand it Is argued that, apart from
lieutenant General Zassalich's error
in giving battle on the Yalu against
the orders of General Kuropakin, the
latter's plan remains -unchanged, and
that, 'once. away from the mountainous
country/he will have conditions much
in his favor.
Dispatches from Shanghai say that
the Tartar general at Mukden has de
clined to obey Viceroy' Alexieff's order
that the Chinese evacuate Mukden.
A 'dispatch to a news agency from
Llaoyang, dated May 10, says: .
"An accident to a train from Port Ar- ;
thur to Harbin occurred May 8, near
Tieling. Thirty passengers were killed
and fifty Injured and" the permanent
way 'was greatly damaged.
The equanimity of the, Government is
shown by the free publications of all
news telegrams from abroad, some
being of a most sensational character.
At the .-general v staft the one
dominant â¢ idea â¢ is ' that the de
velopments; of 1 the . last few
days make it certain the war will
be bitter and long. - Th'ere it is said
that half a' million men ' would have
been required to hold Southern Man
churia. The, real truth seems to be
that General Kuropatkiri has not much
over 200,000 men south of Harbin, and
he Is determined to pursue the plan
which he mapped' out at firstâ to al
low the enemy to follow him back, Into
the heart of Manchuria', until strong
enough to assume the offensive.
The press is Informed that while the
Russian garrison ' is still at New
chwang. the . untenabilltv of the. po
sition is fully realized and prepara
tions for dismantling the Torts and re
moving the garrison have been com
pleted. The Russian gunboat Sivouch
here will be destroyed. The same
thing applies to Haicheng, twenty-flye
miles southeast of Newchttang. * The
question of hqldjbig the Russian po
sition at tiiaoyang depends upon cir
cumstances. The Russians hold the
pass which commands the westerly ap
proaches, but it is realized that the
position there . will also be rendered
untenable if the enemy succeeds in
bringing up a superior force along the
northern road to Mukden.
An ultimate retirement to Harbin
might possibly incur the danger of a
Chinese uprising, which, increases with
the Japanese successes and must be
taken into consideration. Should the
news'of the enemy's victories inflame
the Chinese residents In Manchuria
against the Russians, the latter's
withdrawal north of the zone of their
hostility might become imperative.
The possibility of active .operations
against Vladivostok also have to be
reckoned with.
The general staff inveighs against a
too pessimistic view of the situation,
pointing out thai the Japanese must
land another army before theyÂ» can
hope to make a strong advance move
ment, which will require time. In the
meantime 'the strength of General
Kuropatkin's army and his position
will daily increase. The general staff
repeats the words of the commander
in chief, "Patience, patience, pa
tience." They also insist that the full
extent of the Russian losses on the
Yalu River has been published.
"It Is no guesswork of our losses,"
said a member of the general staff.
"Every man has been accounted for.
Let the enemy publish theirs."
ST. PETERSBURG, May 9, 3:34 p. m.
âThe swift march of events at the
theater of warâ the virtual abandon
ment by the Russians of all' their ad
vanced positions along the Manchurian
littoralâ has created a deep impression
among the people and a feeling of ap
prehension which the authorities con
tend is unwarranted by a calm consid
eration of the" situation. While not at
tempting, to. minimize 'the importance
of the advantages gained by the enemy
In the occupation of the Liaotung
Peninsula . and the advance from tlyÂ»
Yalu River,' the general staff neverthe
less declares, that if it -had not "(been
for General r Zassalitch's - rash stand,
the retreat .and concentration of v? Geh
eral Kuropatkiri'a . army upon its nor
mal line of defense would have 'been
regarded as a masterly piece of
strategy. .â¢ Â¦Â¦.",. . â¢_SL ; :'.. .--i; :.- *
ST. PETERSBURG, May 10.â The
War Committee adjourned at a late
hour this morning, but did not make
public any dispatches from the Far
East. This is accepted as an indica
tion that no fresh collisions have oc
curred.
The Cossacks in touch with the Jap
anese are 6imply small detachments
Â¦which are observing the movements of
the enemy in order to keep General
Kuropatkin informed.
The strict censorship prevented the
St. Petersburg newspapers from re
ceiving dispatches to-day and the lack
of information gave rise to a fresh
crop of rumors, including one that the
armored cruiser Rurlk had been de
stroyed. The officials deny that any
information of this character has been
received, saying that the latest reports
showed that the Rurik was undamaged
and was in the harbor of Vladivostok.
Count Vorontzoff Dashkoff, head of
the Russian Red Cross, authorizes an
absolute denial of the report published
by a news agency in the United States
that an urgent telegram had been re
ceived at St. Petersburg from Mukden
asking for the immediate dispatch of

ST. LOUIS, May 9. â There is now
no allotted space in any of the World's
Fair buildings that is not occupied
with the exception of the reservations
for exhibits from Russia and Argen
tina, which are en route to St. Louis.
Workmen were put to work to-day in
the various industries building to
prepare the space allotted to Russia
and have it in readiness for quick in
stallation of the exhibits. It is stated
that Russia and the Argentine repub
lic will have their exhibits installed by
June 1.
The first carload of exhibits to reach
the World's Fair for installment was
â¢ the Pennsylvania postoffice car, which
was delivered at the grounds on Octo
ber 29,' 1903. From that time until
7 o'clock this morning 4833 cars of
exhibits had been delivered within the
World's Fair enclosure. Almost 1000
cars are yet expected. Traffic Man
ager C. L. Hillery of the exposition
made , the statement that the total
number of cars has been tripled
over the capacity of cars of eleven
years ago and consequently a larger
amount of exhibits has been installed in
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition than
was installed at the former. Reports
have been current that shipments were
unnecessarily delayed in reaching, the
World's Fair grounds after arriving at
the terminal yards in East St. Louis
and St. Louis. This is emphatically
denied by Traffic Manager Hillery.
The board of lady managers, which
has been in daily session for a week,
held its final meeting to-day and ad
journed until July 14. All the mem
bers of the board will return to their
homes, excepting Mrs. Daniel Manning,
president: Mrs. F. E. Ernest of Den
ver, Mrs. Mary Phelps Montgomery of
Portland, Or., and Miss Lavina Egan,
secretary, who will remain in St. Louis
during the exposition period.

charged with the murder of Police
man Eugene C. Robinson at Sixteenth

1902, was called before Judge Cook
yesterday and dismissed.
The Judge said that when the Dis

miss on Friday and the defendant ob
jected and insisted upon a trial he
thought he was acting within his
rights. Since then, the Judge said, he
had found that the matter was fcn
tirely in the discretion of the court
and he would grant the District At
torney's motion to dismiss the case on
the ground that the evidence was in
sufficient to convict and there was no
further desire to prosecute the de
fendant. District Attorney Byington
remarked that if any evidence was
disclosed implicating the defendant in
the murder he would be compelled to
proceed against him.

ST. LOUIS, May 9.â Californlans*
in St. Louis were somewhat dis
j appointed by the failure to open their
\ State building on the initial day of the
j Worlds Fair. Other State buiWings
were opened, though some of them
were not completed. The California
structure was not entirely finished,
\ though the furniture had been on hand
1 some days. Some was in place and
j some was not unpacked. The Com
1 missioners, owing to a press of other
* matters, could only get their own liv
1 ing apartments, to which the upper
1 portion of the California building is
j devoted, furnished and ready during
; April.
Thare is cui'.e a happy family quar
tered in the California building. It
consists of the Commissioners and
their families and a number of em
ployes. The quarters are very com
fortable and will be especially desirable
during the summer months, owing to
the piazzas and fine ventilation.
The furnishings of the building are
S very ornate. The Mission furniture to
be used has been loaned the commis
; sion by the manufacturers. There are
i also here a large number of fine Call
Â¦ fornia landscapes done in oil, which
were not deemed available by the fair
management for the Liberal Arts
I building. A few of these have been
I hung and it is the regret of the Cora
1 missioners that there is no room in
which to hang them all.
DATE FOR OPENING.
The opening of the California build
ing has been set for May 15 and the
structure will probably be opened on
that day. There will be no ceremony
of any sort, according to the present
programme. Commissioner Wiggins
thinks the carpets would be spoiled by
a large crowd and Commissioner Fil
cher doesn't think anything would be
gained by an ostentatious opening. A
register will probably be placed on the
counter.
The California Press Association is
to arrive here on the night of the 15th.
There will be about ninety members of
the party. Secretary Willis of the
California Commission, who is a mem
ber of the executive committee of the
association, has secured accommoda
tions at an inn within the fair grounds
for that number, a special rate of from
XI 50 to 53 a day, American, being
given for the editors. Fred W. Rich
ardson of the Berkeley Gazette, who
is president of the association, will be
in charge of the party. Raleigh Barcar
of Vacaville is the secretary. The party
will be met by Mr. Willis, who will see
that all are properly taken care of.
United States Senator Perkins and
Congressmen Needham and Bell were
at the fair last week. They arrived on
the 4th. The California representa
tives, though they made no open criti
ciEm. didn't seem to think the State
building was quite elaborate enough
for such a great ccmmonwealth, but
they did say it was tasteful and pretty
as far as it went. m hey ". ere delighted
with the exhibits made by the coun
ties in the Horticultural and Agricul
tural buildings and greatly praised the
forestry and mining displays. Congress
men Needham and Bell inspected with
particular pride <v ie fruits and other
products from their separate districts
and said they were proud they repre
sented such a State. Senator Perkins
spent some time in conversation . with
Commissioners Weilbye and Raap of
Alameda and Contra Cosia. - He also
viewed and admired the San Francisco
building.
CALIFORXIAXS AT FAIR.
Mrs. Norma Lutge, now the wife of
a prominent New York business man,
but wh'ose father was a pioneer of San
Francisco and owner of one of the first
theaters there, was a visitor to the fair
during the week. Mrs. Lutge is the
daughter of Otto Maehi, . who went
from Kansas to what was then Terba
Buena in 1848. He returned East, but
went to San Francisco in lf5S and opsn
cd the Metropolitan Theater at Mont
gomery and Sacramento streets. Mrs.
Lutge spent her girlhood days in San
Francisco and there became Mrs.
Stuhr. With her first husband she re
moved to Glindale, near Los Angeles,
seventeen years ago and claims the dis
tinction of being the first person in
"In the struggle forced upon us," he j
continued, "the missionary's ' la'ce is :
by the side of his fellow countryman.
I cannot recognize him as a prosecutor
or as a judge."
Answering the criticisms on the sub
ject of the piecemeal method of send
ing troops to German Southwest
Africa, the Chancellor said the Gov
ernment had followed the advice of
Governor Leutwein, who had many
years' experience there. When it was
seen that a larger force was necessary
the Government recognized the impos
sibility' of Governor Leutwein direct
ing both the military and civil govern
ment at the same time, hence the ne
cessity for sending a military com
mander to conduct the larger opera
tions, while Leutwein devoted himself
to the- civil administration. ,
The Chancellor" denied that the an
tipathies of the world were against
Germany. They existed in a measure
as Herr Bebel had described, but, he
added, "if so, that it would be a rea
son for maintaining our military
equipment so as to calmly anticipate
any eventuality. of the future, for no
other means have been discovered to
disarm, unjustifiable hate and envy â
for hate and envy against us is .unjus
tifiable; since our policy has been for
thirty-three years eminently peace
ful â than to keep the sword sharp."
Dr. Steubel, referring to an inquiry
of Herr Bebel, recently made as to
whether a command should be given
to the South African troops not to give
quarter and not to take prisoners, said
a telegraphic inquiry on the subject
had brought forth the answer that no
such order had been given. There
had been no firing upon -women and
children. No wounded prisoners had
yet' been taken; even tHfe wounded men
always, continue firing till rendered
helpless. Dr. Steubel continued read-
Ing the cablegram:
"The^other prisoners were brought
before a; court-martial. It is impos
sible- to ' give their precise number.
Â¦There have been no acts of violence
to native women, now or formerly.
The Herreros . formerly were cruel to
women," but not now, because we
spared , ninety-six Herrero" women on
our first .; military expedition. â¢ Three
white women were killed and several
were wounded. The children and the
missionaries were spared. English
men were spared for political reasons,"
BERLIN, May 9.â During the discus
sion following the third reading of the
budget bill in the Reichstag to-day
Herr Bebel, the Socialist leader, re
ferred to Emperor William's speeches
at Carlsruhe and Mayence, remarking
that the pointed allusions to France
had caused great surprise, coming so
soon after the return from
Italy, "where President Loubet had been
received - with hearty ovations. The
Emperor's words, the speaker added,
were enhanced in importance, through
the fact that he telegraphed to Emper
or Nicholas from Sicily, on the occa
sion of the sinking of the Russian bat
tleship Petropavlovsk, as follows:
"Russia's * mourning is Germany's
mourning."
Herr Bebel, continuing, said:
"I deny most emphatically that the
Emperor's telegram reflects the senti
ments of the German people. In my
opinion German sympathies are . far
more on the side of Japan than on that
of Russia."
This statement caused murmurs of
dissent on the Right.
> "The land in which such things can
happen as recently occurred in Rus
sia," continued Herr Bebel, ' "stands
upon such a low level of civilization
that all the rest of Europe has the
most lively interest in seeing the sun
of civilization rise upon it."
Chancellor von Bulow, in his , reply,
began by deprecating the idea that he
intended to enter into a .lengthy dis
cussion of international politics with
Herr Bebel. He pointed out that the
quotation of the Emperor's words was
incorrect. The Emperor's telegram, he
said, expressed warm sympathy on ac
count of the great calamity by which
so many brave* men had met death in
the discharge of their duty. The Chan
cellor added:
"1 am convinced that this expression
of human, sympathy corresponded with
the sentiments of the majority of this
high house and also with those of the
majority of the people of Germany."
Applause from the Right party fol
lowed this- statement, after which the
Chancellor expressed his regret -at the
manner In which many -or the German
newspapers, especially, the comic pub
lications, had utilized the recent calam
ity of a neighboring and friendly power
as the basis for malevolent, spiteful
and ridiculing articles and caricatures,
"which have affronted human feelings
and are lacking in political tact."
The Chancellor pointed out Herr Be
bel's inconsistency in demanding strict
neutrality in the Far Eastern war and
then openly expressed tne hope that
Russia would be defeated. He object
ed to Herr Bebel's historical analogies
as being a divergence from the strict
neutrality which Germany must ob-.
serve.
Alluding to a statement in regard
to the causes of the Herrero uprising,
the Chancellor said he would leave that
matter for Dr. Steubel, director of the
Colonial Office, to answer.
"However," the Chancellor added,
"our countrymen are men of flesh and
blood and like other colonizing peo
ples we have had sad experiences, dis
covering that men sent out were with
out the necessary self-control when un
der the influence of the climate. Great
er power and greater freedom of ac
tion resulted in excesses. Nevertheless,
such cases are only exceptional."
Von Bulow expressed his regret at
the fact that the missionaries had used
the present occasion, when so many
Germans had become the victims of
rude barbarism, to make attacks upon
their fellow countrymen.

fJEDDIXG. May ?.â Mrs. Thomas
.White-man of Dunsmuir made a state
ment to District Attorney Dozier In
Redding to-day regarding: the connec
â¢ tion of George Gates and E. Vernon
. Gates with the holdup of the Oregon
â¢- express at Copley on March 31. Mrs.
/Whiteman's 6tory in brief Is that the
Gates brothers, going under the names
'cf Bruce - Van Drake and Ed Lee.
. stayed at her Riverview lodging house
. at Dunsmuir for several Â¦weeks pre
ceding the crime, that they went
south on the very train that was held
up- Â¦when the stop was made at Copley,
that they returned to their rooms on
the Saturday succeeding the holdup,
which was on Thursday; that they left
on the following Monday and that she
"has eince received letters from George
Gates, whom she knew as Bruce Van
Drake, in which he had confessed the
frf me.
Tb<? letters, of which she had
received three, were turned over to the
authorities. All letters were from
=George Gatee. The last letter was
â¢mailed by him in Portland, Oregon,
en. the night of April 28, but was dated
. May l, and in it Gates claimed to be
in San Francisco, intending to sail the
n^>tt day for Australia. He evidently
feared Mrs. Whiteman would betray
Iriin. but- she told nothing until threat
rned with arrest. The officers estab
(lisbed the bandits' Identity through a
laundry mark. The mark was on a piece
â¢. of handkerchief found In the Nigger
"Hill cabin near Keswick. and torn from
tli<? handkerchief that formed one of the
masks and found at the scene of the
crime. Through the Redding steam
â¢ laundry and its Dunsmuir agent, the
'.mark was found to be that of George
," Gates.
..The detectives later intercepted
all* of George Gates' letters to Mrs.
v.'jiiteman, addressed as Miss Agnes
Brown, and then for fear that she
..-._Â¦):?. know more than they had found
i^ljt, rompelled her to come to District
" "Attorney Dozier here and make a com
Â«. j)lete confession. Through intercepting
?he letters the officers had their hands
â¢ 'practically on George Gates several
I'rnjss, but he managed to elude them.

Â¦ .iirctber. is said to have been in Ala
ftieda day before yesterday, and Arnett
Ms somewhere in hiding in the Klamath
..Falls country. The whereabouts of the
fourth man is unknown.' Mrs. White
.hjan was cross-examined nearly ail
. morning, and the only startling feature
â¢iT her confession was that the Gates
"brothers- left Dunsmuir on the train
.that was held up at Copley. When the
<. J ref?on express stooped at Copley for
v."'aterÂ° they must have jumped off to
join Arnett and the fourth man.

AMAZE ST. LOUIS VISITORS
TÂ«E SAN FRANCISCO CALL/ TUESDAY, MAY 10, 1904.
California to introduce foreign grape
cuttings, other than the Mission varie
ties. Upon her husband's death she
went East.
Mrs. Lutge had been trying unsuc
cessfully since her second marriage to
induce her husband to visit California,
She took him to the magnificent dis
plays of fruits made by the Golden
State and he said he must see the land
where they grrew.
Among the Californians here during
the week were W. D. Noble of Fresno
and Edward H. Mitchell of San Fran
cisco. J. F. Bourke, formerly well
known In newspaper circles in the Cal
ifornia metropolis, but now of Chicago,
call at the California building..
An old-time Californian who was in
the limelight on the opening day of the
exposition is T. S. C. Cunningham, who
is superintendent at the fair grounds
for the Pacific Postal Telegraph Com
pany. He stood alongside President
Francis and saw that the telegraphic
ind electrical arrangements were prop
?rly carried out. Mr. Canningham is
ivell known in San Francisco, where he
makes his home.
SMYRNA FIG. INDUSTRY.
George C. Roeding, who introduced
:he blastophega, the insect fertiliser
)f the Smyrna fig into Fresno County
md at once lifted the California prod
jct from obscurity to an equality with
:he famous Smyrna article, is one of
he men at the exposition who is going
:o do California some good. He is mak
,ng a complete exhibit of the Smyrna
fig as grown in California and also of
the wonderful insect that gives it the
flavor that mak/s it marketable. Mr.
Roeding says there is a great future
for the fig as a commercial crop and
that it can be grown in every part of
the State from north to south where
there is dry, hot summer weather. In
the northern counties, where the rain
fall averages twenty inches or more,
the trees can be grown successfully
without irrigation, he says. .
Not only will visitors from abroad be
deeply interested in the fig and the in
sect agent, under the influence of
which it becomes a delicious condiment,
but California orchardlsts who visit
the fair will receive information that
may be of value to them in the matter
of producing the fig. Mr. Roeding will
have the exhibit ready in a few days.
The fair management issued a notice
to all exhibitors last week that all ex
hibits must be finished by May 12. This
nicluded California, of course, and some
of the counties, could not possibly be
finished by that date. The order did
not cause much alarm as it was gen
erally deemed that it was issued more
to produce a "hurry-up" than any
thing else. Hammers and saws
are still making music in some parts
of the" California section, in the agri
cultural "buildings, and there is work
yet to be done on other displays, but
the 15th will see the great bulk of
California's labors completed.
<3ne of the principal lines of ques
tioning by strangers to California who
view her exhibits is as to the names
of the various fruits and other, prod
ucts shown. To. people from most of
the other States and, from many for
eign countries there are products in the
California sections that are utterly new
and they are much carried away by
the show as is the small boy who
makes his* first visit to the zoo. Prod
ucts that some visitors thought could
only be seen in countries foreign to the
United States they are surprised to
find set before them in fullest variety
and. finest quality by California, Jap

The last witness of. this, strenuous
day was. Joseph B. Frontin of Tucson,
-Ariz., who showed himself able to keep
up the interest of the room full of
spectators to the end. Frontin is as
mild-mannered a ."cow puncher" as
ever straddled a bronco, but he
showed an ability to fire up under
provocation that relieved his testimony
of all monotony. He had long 'been
employed on Fred Hyde's -ranches and
thus had become a confidential friend
of Schneider. .His testimony, which
was not completed when" court . ad
journed for the day, was in part as
follows:
"When we were in tbjs State Schneider ask
ed me to make application for , California
school lands and to get others to do the same.
I did both, â¢ but never got any â¢ pay - for It.
Since going to Tucson . I hava . seen much of
Schneider. - He told me he had made some
sort of a statement to Colonel Zabriskie for
the Interior Department regarding Hyde's
business - In State and Government lands. He
also told - me that Hyde " had been using fic
titious names: that were obtained In answer
to advertisements." He said that Elizabeth Di
mond was a fictitious person. "
- When Slack came down to Tucson to inter
view Schneider in 'Hyde's Interest, Schneider
told me "all about It. He was sorry then that
he had told the Government what he had, be
cause he and Slack - were Â¦" good frtenda and he
thought Slack might get Into trouble. He
also told ' me - of Dimond's visit, saying that
they had" talked in a . circle' and accomplished

"Well, you see I read the testimony
about this woman being ilctitious, in
the newspapers, and I remember we
had a servant . girl some years ago
whose name was Lizzie. What her last
name was I cannot say. No, I cannot
tell .whether she was old or young,. tall
or short, stout or slim, fair or dark, or
how long ago she was at our house."
After this '.' ilure to substantiate the
woman whose name Hyde had used as
the selector of immense tracts of lieu
lands, Mr. Morris was succeeded on the
stand by his son, H. C. Morris. The
memory of the younger, man was equal
ly hazy as to most things he was asked
about. He could Â«not aid his cousin
with any more positive testimony as
to the alleged servant. He only remem
bered that some .woman named Eliza
beth or Lizzie had -been employed for
An indefinite period and at an Indefinite
time as cook in the family home 'at
Oakland. Commissioner Heacock had
already said with emphasis in court
that he was satisfied that- there > never
was any Elizabeth Dimond. con
viction was not shaken yesterday.
M. D. Hyde, brother of Fred Af,
;WaÂ»T then called Â¦ for the Government;
He told of his visit to Arizona in com
pany with Walter' W.' , Slack, when . the
latter was sent , to. "pump" Defendant
Schneider as to - his admissions to the
Federal agents, but he had nothing
new to tell on that point. â¢ He had^.an
office' in. his brother's -fsulte -, at '415
Montgomery street for many years.
On one point, however, his testimony
was of more use to the prosecution.
Heney questioned him rigorously re
garding the mythical Elizabeth Di
mond, who has figured so prominently
in the testimony, as one of Hyde's se
lectors. The defendant, Henry P. Di
mond, had testified that Hyde always
told him Elizabeth Dimond was 'a ser
vant in his Uncle Morris' family.
"Do you know Elizabeth Dimond?"
asked Heney. - .â¢"'"" /
".Well, I don't know, whether I do or
not," said the cautious old financier,
"Why do you laugh?"
Lavenson's testimony strongly cor-"
roborated McCusker's as to the manner
in which the Oregon school lands were
acquired by Schneider for the Hyde-
Benson partnership. Henry S. Morris,
the venerable Oakland banker, was the
next witness called by Heney. He said
he was an uncle of Defendant Fred A.
Hyde and had at different times had
land transactions with his nephew. He
could not recall .whether he had ever
owned any State school lands or wheth
er he had made any application' for
forest lieu selections. Ir^ fact' he had
forgotten nearly everything the Gov
ernment wanted to know and was quite
unable to explain how his name came
to appear in the Hyde applications be
fore the land office.
AS TO EL.IZ ABETH DIMOXD.
As- Benson's clerk, I knew that he and Hyde
were Jointly Interested In the Oregon lands.
I have eeen the Joln^ account, in which these
lands were charged up at $1 "3 an acre, and
the balance of receipts on sales equally divided
between Benson and Hyde. One-half of *>1
mond's salary was charged to Benson.
I had through the Portland city directory, bu
they all denied that they were the persons tha
had acted tot Schneider. Out of all the sev
enty-flve names I could only get two person
to admit that they had taken up any lands.
D. Alexander, the notary public who testl
fied here, told me thnt Schneider had com
to his office with a lot of person* whom h
had never seen. Other notaries said the Mm
thlny.
I had made a number of - tripe â¢ to Oregon
for Benson before Hyde asked me, In Febru
ary or' March. 1903. to go up there and try
to straighten out his Oregon school land titles.
He said Borne . charges had been ' made - that
these titles were irregular, and he wanted me
to get statements from as many a* possible of
the people who had taken up. the lands show-
Ing that they had taken them up In good faith
for their own use and . not for ; speculation.
Hyde gave me some, carda with names -â¢ and
plats on them.* McCusker was one of the men
I saw at Portland. He declined â¢ to giv* me
an affidavit. - 1 found j only one â¢ other person
who admitted that he had taken up lands for
Schneider. I found many others whose names
James H. Lavenson, who has been a
clerk for Benson jever since -1891, was
the next witness. .He was questioned
by Heney on thÂ« lines of McCusker's
testimony regarding the Oregon . land
transactions conducted for' Hyde . by
Defendant Joost H. Schneider.: Laven

Clara E. Glover, called by Heney,
then took the stand. Before the Gov
ernment attorney began his questions
Schlesinger objected to her examina
tion, on the ground that the State law's
made information obtained by '.- em
ployes from their employers. privileged.
But the Commissioner overruled the
objection with emphasis, -..kaylng,
"There can be no privilege in^crime."
On Schlesinger's . . request; : . however,
Heacock instructed 'the .witness 4 that
she was not 'obliged to give, evidence
that would incriminate, herself.-; This
unnecessary, .as .Miss ; Glover
"proved, a very circumspect "witness,
thus differing from some, of * Hyde's
stenographers, .who have apparently

"No.' I had been instructed to keep

of the department."

witness.

Bert Schlesinger of Hyde's counsel in
cross-examination.

Later In the same year I wrote her that I
needed $220 and asked her to hand It to my
cousin. Edwin Taggart. the Oakland druggist,
now dead. She replied by telegraph, "O. K.
Will pay money to Edwin Taggart and get re
ceipt." She did this and my couain paid the
money over to Benjamin F. Woolner, -the Oak
land attorney, who was pressing me for'a debt
due to an estate he was closing up. This
money was not repaid to Benson or Miss Ulo
ver. I treated it as a paymemrfor the inform

INVALID ORDINANCE.
The ordinance declared to be uncon
stitutional by Judge Hebbard reads as
follows:
Section 1.â It shall be unlawful for any per
son firm or 'corporation, club -or association,
to carry on any business or to pursue any trade
or vocation within the- limit* of the city and
county of San FranciBCo in any house, room
or building connected by any door, window,
stair? steps, hall, passageway, court or alley
(not a public street) or by any door, court or
alley (not a public street) with any house,
room or building which is used or resorted to
for the purpose of prostitution.
Section 'Â£. â Any person, rlrm. corporation,
club or association who shall violate the pro
visions of this ordinance shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall
be punished by a fine not to exce-d $500. or br
imprisonment In the County Jail for not more
than rlx months or by both such fine and im
prisonment. _
Take, by way of illustration, a very possible
case which would come within the provisions
of thin ordinance â a firm or a corporation
having been for twenty years In the dry
goods business in this city, carrying a stock
of goods worth $100,000, located In a three
story building of which, for the twenty years
said firm or corporation had occupied the first
and* third floors, but not the second floor; t
night of stairs that led to the second and top j
floors and through a door from the lower floo.' I
to the stairway IS the only way to reach the i
upper floor; suddenly the second floor i*
tenated and . is used for and resorted to foi {
Illicit purposes, then the said firm or cor- j
poratlon must move on or become subject to i
arrest from day to day as long as it remains
In that building and to a fine of $500 or lm- Â¦
prlsonment In the county Jail, or possibly both.
A multitude of other Illustrations might be .
given showing to what absurd results the en- j
forcement of -such an ordinance might lead. |
For these reasons and under the decisions abovp
cited and many others, the court holds said j
ordinance. So. 1159, to be unconstitutional
and void.
It Is" therefore ordered that tke demurrer
be overruled without leave to defendants to
further answer, and that a perpetual injunction
be issued herein as prayed.
Judge Hebbard's opinion, in part, is
as follows:
The ordinance is invalid. McQuillan on
Municipal' Ordinance, at section 2i!S, citing
a number of kindred cases, fays cuch ordi
nance* are unconstitutional. It !s unneces
sary to go Into the various cases cited on this
point, for a mere reading of the ordinance
itself is sufficient to show t-xfn to {the lay
man's mind that It is absurd; that It is an
exercise of police power Without reaHon, and
that Its enforcement would amount to a con
fiscation of property without and beyond the
authority of the constitution.
COURT'S OPINION".
Ordinance No. 1159, passed by the
Board of Supervisors last March, which
makes 't a misdemeanor for any per
feon, firm, corporation, club or associa
tion to carry- on or conduct a business
in any building any part of which is
used for Illicit purposes, is invalid in
the opinion of Judge Hebbard. In a
decision^ rendered -by him yesterday
overruling the demurrer of the .City (At
torney to the. suit of Jean Pon for an
Injunction restraining the police from
interfering with him "or molesting htm
in hia'conduct of a restaurant and cigar
store at 1129 Dupont street, he sayu
the ordinance is not only a violation of
the constitution, but an absurd In
fringement by the Board* of Super
visors upon the rights of. citizens. The
decision makes permanent the tempor
ary, injunction issued to Pon at the time
his complaint was filed, and denies to
the city authorities the permission to
amend their answeMo his complaint.
Upsets Supervisors' Efforts
to Prevent Use of Build
ings for Illicit Purposes
To test the validity of an art passed
by the Legislature of California dur
ing' the session in 1901 making it a
felony to interrupt or break any wires
carrying currents of electricity, D. J.
Sullivan, a contracting house-mover,
.subjected himself to arrest yesterday.
The charge was preferred by the Sun
"s<H Telephone and Telegraph .Com
pany, because some of its wires had
been severed during the process of
moving a house on Hyde street. He
was arrested by Policeman Prowse
and booked at the Central police sta
tion for violation of section 593 of the
Penal Code. He was immediately re
leased on bail of J125.
Lfcte yesterday afternoon the United
Kailronds applied to Superior Judge
Frank Kerrigan for an order restrain
ing Sullivan from interfering with the
trolley lines at Hyde and Ellis streets.
The complaint stated that the cor
poration had been informed of an in
tention upon the part of the t house
moving contractors to test the validity
of the act passed by the Legislature
in 1901 creating a felony punishment
for severing wires carrying electrical
currents used in public service. The
complaint- also stated that the '"Owl
car" service would be seriously inter
fered with by a severance of the trol
ley'wires at this point.
Sullivan has plucked a two-story
frame house of ancient lineage from
its base at the corner of Ellis and Hyde
street? snd started it on its way
toward the northern shores of the bay.
In order to make the Journey by direct
route it will be necessary- to cut the
telephone wires and the trolley wires
of the United Railroads in many places
and when he applied to the company,
for this permission h* was refused. He
M*nt right ahead, however, with his
moving operations and landed the
house in the middle of Hyde street,
much to the detriment of the. tele
phone wires fronting on the corner.
Then he announced his intention to
tote that old house around pretty
plenty, without regard to telephone or
trolley wires, under a permit he had
secured from the Board of Public
Works. The United Railroads accord
ing filed its complaint and a tem
porary restraining order was issued,
returnable before Judge Murasky on
May 20.
Heretofore house-movers have been
in the habit of notifying the various
electrical companies and the wires
have been severed for them. Now it is
proposed to make a fight against block
ing the streets and impeding public
convenience by moving old houses in
stead of tearing them down.

. â¢ DENVER. May 3. â In the litigation
arising from the breaking of the
' Checseman dam above Buffalo Park
Several years ago Judge Johnson in
the District Court to-day overruled the

Company, defendant, pleading that the
'break was caused by the act of God;
that the company had not been proven
guilty of negligence in building or
Siaintaining the dam, and that it
should be held immune from any
judgment.-
I Judge Johnson in his opinion holds
that builders of reservoirs are liable

Uie collapse of a dam constructed by
them. About J 100,000 worth of Colo

WASHINGTON, .May 9.â President
Roosevelt had a : long 'conference to-day
with* Secretaries Hay and Taft and At
torney General Knox, at which , the reg
ulations to govern the Isthmian Canal
Commission ; were "determined upon
finally.
While the creation and work of the
commission is committed by law to the
President, .whose authority in that re
gard is practically supreme, the Pres
ident, by ' the regulations, directs that
the commission shall exercise Its pow
ers under the direction' and supervision
of the Secretary of War.
General George W. Davis, the, army
member of the commission, is-appoint
ed governor of the American zone ! on
the isthmus. . Until the expiration of
the Fifty-eighth Congress the Isthmian
Canal Commission will exercise legis
lative authority over the American
strip. Governor Davis is given author
ity to appoint one Judge, who shall ex
ercise judicial authority.
Under the operation of what is
known as the Dockery law the audit
ing of the commission's accounts will
fall to the duty of the Auditor of the
State Department, but beyond the mat
ter of auditing the State Department
will not be charged with any control
over the commission. The commission
will report directly to the Secretary of
War as often as he may direct upon all
phases of its operations. It will be
under the same sort of control of the
Secretary of War as is the Philippine
Commission.

In the House, however, there is
nothing of that kind. It is divided
against itself by the center aisle, on
one side of which sit the Democrats
and on'the other the Republicans. Ev
ery proposition is viewed with sus
picion by one side according as it
comes from the other side. Nor does
opposition confine itself to these lim
its. It is quite likely to appear on
both sides. So far as friendships are
concerned half the members have not
even a speaking acquaintance with the
other half â the political division hav
ing nothing to do with this relation.
The members simply do not come to
gether, many of them passing through
session after session as strangers to
many other members. And yet friend
ships here count for much, as may
well be understood. To secure the
passage of a bill of importance to an
individual member, that member must
first convince the members of the
committee to which it is referred.
That is no small job, seeing that very
many bills go to the" committee, but
if the author has friends on the com
mittee it is easier. If it finds a front
place on the calendar â which it will
do only if it is early reported â then it
may be reached in the regular order
of business. In any other case the
author is, first, at the complete mercy
of "Uncle Joe Cannon." He must ne
gotiate a "recognition" from Uncle
Joe. For not every man who rises up
and says "Mr. Speaker" gets a greet
ing. It must â especially in the late
hours of the session â -he all arranged
for in advance. Mr. Cannon must have
been consulted, the bill explained and
he convinced that it is a proper meas
ure. He wili tell you that there are
thirty other bills of the same kind
that have an equal right to be passed,
and, to be fair to them, WÂ«: must not
see or hear you should you speak to
him from the floor.
FAVORS ARE PREARRANGED.
Should you convince him and gain
his favor and ct.ll up your bill out of
its order, then some man who does not
know you or your bill,' or who knows
you but does not Snow your bill, or
who knows your bill, but does not
know you, or who knows and docs not
like youâ one or the other of these
contingencies out of the great assem
blage on the floor will rise up and stop
you. Should you run the gauntlet of
all these preliminaries to a fair hear
ing on the floor, then you have noth-
JIOUSE IS DIVIDED.
Great heaps of papers are piled up In
the House document roomârepresenta
tive in great measure of the bills that
did not pass. For most of them it was
never intended that they should pass â
that is by the leaders. Those who in
troduced them of course may have had
great hopes, and this is largely a mat
ter of experience. Those who have
had much experience have little hope.
Congress having fixed a .day for ad
journment, the struggle to secure pass
age of pet measures that had been in
steady progress since the opening day
had taken oh the character of a stam
pede and congestion followed. That is
to sav, there is .every appearance of
congestion, and those who made the
struggle believed there would be a con
gestion. But from the time the hour
for adjournment is fixed there are those
who know how every intervening hour
is to be employed â who are to have the
floor and for how long, what bills are
to be allowed to make the goal. The
bills of national importance of course
have precedence. For the others it Is
a matter with the Speaker of the
House, principally.
In the Senate a bill of local import
ance has a comparatively easy time of
it, for it is a part of the courtesy that
is a law to that body that no Senator
shall oppose a bill in which another
Senator is specially interested in be
half of his own constituency. The
Senators â because of their compara
tively small number â are all intimate
ly acquainted and, with but a few ex
ceptions, on friendly terms. For a
Senator to interpose objection to a
measure of only local interest, unless
it should call for a large appropria
tion or be In some other way unusual,
is deemed most "ungracious."
Where are the statesmen of yester
day? They have gone back to the
States, that is all. Nothing has hap
pened to them â but they do not know
what may happen.. The Congress is
dissipatedâ they have scattered over
the face of the land.
STATESMEN" HAVE GONE.
WASHINGTON, May 9.â The scene
on Capital Hill to-day bears the same
relation to the scene at the same place
this day of last week as does the scene
on Market street of a Saturday night
to the scene on the same thoroughfare
early of a Sunday morning. While no
wild weeds are allowed to gather at the
gates, the Capital halls are desolate.
The perennial visitor and sight-seer
wanders down the long corridors and
listens In a subdued and listless way
to the drone of the guide as he explains
the frescoes on the wall. The peculiar
acoustic properties of the Hall of
Fameâ which Is "one of the sights" of
the capitalâ are tested by the passing
stranger under conditions that, for such
a purpose, leave nothing: to be de
sired. For the passing stranger Is
alone, his voice is the only voice to be
heard, and he may show what interest
he feels In the strange tricks the echoes
play without fear of the smile of the
accustomed throng. '-:?-"'*;
Indeed the acoustic properties of the
whole building may be tested now, for
the echo of the occasional footstep goes
hurtling down the corridors as though
eager to fill them with the multiplied
sounds of yesterday or to do what they
can to rob them of the depressing
silence of to-day. Down In the musty
shadows of the ground floor there
is the nailing and trundling of boxes as
porters pack away books and papers.
In the committee rooms, the galleries
and both the chambers of Congress the
house cleaner is at work, and out in the
sunshine, in the surrounding grounds,
is the man with the mower.
I had a talk with Secretary Wilson
the other day concerning the ''testing
garden" recently purchased at Chico
by the Agricultural Department. The
testing garden is what its name indi
cates, a garden to test the possibilities
of the soil of California, and is dis
tinguished as such' from the station
and the laboratory at Santa Ana.
"We are doing more for California
than for any other State in the Union,"
said Secretary Wilson, "and on the
other hand California â not the State
government, but the scientific men of
California â Is doing less for us. The
garden at Chico comprises fifty acres.
It was chosen after a careful prospect
of the whole State for its advantages
of climate and soil. It has a consid
erable rainfall, more than could be
found farther south and if need be
Irrigation may be had. The soil is fine
and rich. We can grow here
fruits of a wider range than most other
points. Fruits will not be grown, how
ever, but the trees for distribution. T.
If. Dorset will be the general officer
in charge."
A Boston firm of architects, Carree
& Hastings, is commissioned to go over
the Walter plan and suggest what
changes may seem to them as neces
sary or proper. The joint commission
is composed of Senators Wetmore, Al
g:er and Gorman and Representatives
Cannon, Hepburn and Richardson. The
model of the Capitol building as it will
appear when completed is still on view
in the rotunda. An appropriation was
made by Congress for its carriage to
and exhibition at St. Louis.
TO IXSPECT BUILDINGS.
It is not Quite true that all the mem
bers of the Congress have gone back
to their fences, for several committees
have been at work during the week
upon commissions left them by the
body before adjournment. One of these
is the Joint commission authorized to
report to Congress next December with
regard to plans for the extension and
completion of the Capitol building in
accordance with the Walter plans.
They have decided upon the extension
according to the earlier Walter plan,
which provides for an extension of the
east front of the main building to a
line with the wings. The later Walter
plan brought the center out beyond
the wings. Some critics .were of the
opinion that this left the dome rela
tively small and was the cause of its
rejection in favor of the earlier plan.
Ing to do in the world to secure a
passage for your bill but to convince a
majority of the members, few of
whom care, or understand, or will
listen while you explain, that your bill
is y. eood one and should be passed.
This is the difference between the Sen
ate and the House. It is true that
senatorial courtesy â though it now
and-lhen slips a link â is a very potent
factor In the legislation of the upper
house. In the lower it is all hard
knocks.

Is.iri dire need, especially now that the

taciturn! In his cups last night he ad
mitted that he had been fiendish in his
actions. Before he came to Oakland
Riley had a special policeman's com
mission In San Francisco and for a
time served as a watchman at some of
the cheaper .theaters across the bay.
j Evidence of the assault was collected
by the police. It includes the oil-soaked
garments, the saturated bed clothing,
the scores of burnt matches on the
floor, a can of kerosene and the broken
glass.
OAKLAND, May 9.â Mrs. Edward J.
Riley, victim of her husband's
atrocious attempt to burn her alive by
firing her kerosene-soaked garments
with matches, swore to a complaint in
the Police Court to-day charging Riley
with assault to commit murder. Riley
was before Police Judge Mortimer
Smith this morning on a charge of
drunkenness, and was sent to the City
Trison for three days. This Â¦ action
was taken that the man might be in
custody until Mrs. Riley could take
steps to prosecute her brutal spouse
on a more serious count. The assault
case haa been set for arraignment to
morrow before Judge Smith.
That the delicate little woman and
her children, Edwin and Marie, es
caped death yesterday afternoon in
their humble home, 1007 Seventh street
(rear), where occurred Riley's fiendish
attack, is a miracle. The liquor-frenzied
man made effort after effort to burn
his helpless wife after he had drenched
her clothing with coal oil. He found
her resting on a bed when he entered
the rooms, inflamed from whisky and
enraged because his ill wife did not
resound immediately to his demands
for dinner. The woman, whose condi
tion is such that she should have the
tenderest attention, had no chance to
rise before Riley drenched her with
kerosene, which soaked through her
clothing and the bed ctothes. After the
fiend had failed to. kill his wife, be
cause of her struggles to prevent igni
tion of her clothing, he hurled a glass
at her. head and departed, to be ar
rested soon afterward.

To spoon in the moonlight under the
foliage of Lafayette Square is Inter
dicted by stern order of a proeaic
Board of Police Commissioners. Cupid
has been locked out, as it were, and
sighing swains may no longer tell their
tales of love amid the romantic sur
roundings of the pretty plaza. '
' . To this end has Charles D. Burck
halter, astronomer and head of Chabot
Observatory that occupies the center
of the park, been appointed a special
policeman. Professor Burckhalter in
his new role will he permitted to wear
a star bigger than Mars appears to be
the great lenses In the observ
atory.
Armed with the authority of the law
it will be expected of the learned star
gazer and mathematician that he shall
rudely break into all trysts and warn
the intruding devotees of Cupid away.
Love-making al fresco does not
appeal to Professor Burckhalter. He
complained to the powers that too
many siisceptlbles were converting
Lafayette Park into a meeting place
for osculation. Now the distinguished
astronomer believes the park and its
surroundings, particularly the observa
tory therein, is being a bit scandalized
by the absorbing,^ world forgetting
young men and women who have been
haunting the square on favored nights.
Professor Burckhalter prefers to re
serve the. place for the. duller affairs of
science, hence hi3 protest.
â¢ That he may uphold the dignity of
the place and preserve the' peace and
quiet "of the park, Professor Burck
halter has essayed the role of a police
man.

Plloted by Judge Cook and Detec
tive Tom Gibson, the members of the
jury who are to decide whether or not
Leon Soeder is guilty of the murder of
his brother-in-law, Joseph Blaise, on
the night of January 10, visited the
scene of the crime and had pointed
out to them the locations of various
points In the neighborhood upon
which material testimony will be in
troduced during the trial.
The defendant accompanied the
court and jury on the trip. All
through the ordeal of viewing the
scene whither it is claimed he decoyed
Blaise and plunged a knife into his
relative's throat Soeder preserved the
same stolidity of countenance that has
marked his demeanor through all of
the court procedings so far had. He
smoked a cigarette with evident relish
and the only evidence of his uneasi
ness apparent was the nervous twitch
ing of his hands.
When the Jury gathered around the
spot where Blaise's body h.ad been
found Soeder took one quick glance at
the, grass and then turned away and
riveted his gaze on the cliff on the op
posite side of the cut Not once again
did he look toward the spot where his
brother-in-law bled to death from a
stab in the throat
KEEPS FACE CONCEALED.
During the car ride from the Hall
of Justice to Union and Taylor streets
Soeder kept a handkerchief before his
face in an endeavor to prevent the
newspaper photographers from taking
his picture. Later he put away the
handkerchief and even went so far as
to halt and allow himself to be photo
graphed. When the Jury gathered
about the spot where Blaise's body
was found on the morning of January
11, Soeder puffed his cigarette calm
ly. A woman who had followed the
procession up the hill said: "I wonder
how he can smoke at this place."
Soeder heard her and he looked
toward her with a glint in his eyes
like a flash of a new bowie knife. She
paled under his gaze and shrank back
into the crowd.
The Soeder case was . taken â¢ up by
Judge Cook at 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon. No witnesses were on hand,
as it had been decided to give the jury
an opportunity to view the neighbor
hood of the crime. In. addition R.
Porter Ashe. Assistant District Attor
ney, requested that the Jury be allowed
to inspect the Neiblas residence at 827
Jackson street, where Blaise and
Soeder occupied a room together up to
the time of the murder. Thia was ob
jected to by General Salomon, coun
sel for the defense,. but the objection
was overruled by Judge Cook, who
held that the Jury might properly visit
any place about which material facts
might be developed during the head
ing. Salomon requested that the Jury
be allowed to view the crossing of
Union and Taylor streets and this was
readily granted.

tion Judge Cook warned members of
the jury that they were only to use
their eyes and not their ears when view
ing the scene and that no chance re
mark from either the officers of the
court or any outsider should be con
sidered by them. He then placed the
Jury in the hands of Bailiff Martin
Welch and Soeder was taken In charge
by Deputy Sheriffs Meynert and Kings
ley. All the officers of the court went
along and the court reporter recorded
all statements made to the jurors.
The Union-street car that carried the
court and Jury to Taylor and Union
streets was packed to its full capacity
by the party, which included counsel
for the prosecution and the defense,
reporters and Dhotographers. When
the car reached Taylor street the party
got off and Detective Tom Gibson
pointed out to the Jury the lamp post

that this is one of the spots about

ARRIVAL ON THE SCENE. f
Mr. Scott said he had talked about
the matter of extending the sea wall
and building new and permanent
wharves with Harbor Commissioner
Spear. He had the assurance of Com
missioner Spear that the Board of
State Harbor Commissioners had no
intention to tax the shipping of the
port $y increasing the port charges.
Captain Marston said the only in
crease that could be made would be
in wharfage rates. Several of those
present represented that nil the cost
would fall on San Francisco. The in
terior would be benefited by the pro
motion of shipping interests at this
port. The proposition includes the
mortgaging of all the* property of the
State on the San Francisco water front
to secure a bond issue of $2,000,000.
The voters of the State will be called
upon to vote on this proposition in
November at the general election. .
Thomas J. Parsons moved that a
committee of five be appointed by the
chair to submit a plan for the consid
eration of the joint conference of com
mercial bodies. This was adopted and
the committee was made up as fol
lows: "W. H. Marston, E. Scott, T. J.
Parsons, George Renner and A. C.
Rulofson.
â¢ Representatives of the commercial
organizations of San Francisco were
invited to take part in a conference
that came off yesterday" afternoon in
the Chamber of Commerce hall, the
purposes of which was to. form a plan
to secure' favorable, action on a prop
osition to raise $2,000,000 on a bond
issue for the extension of the sea wall
in this city between its present south
ern terminus, and the Pacific Mail
dock. The construction of the sea
wall, as explained by Secretary E.
Scott of the Chamber of Commerce,
would be only the first step toward
increasing the dockage facilities south
of Harrison street. New wharves are
needed. The general conclusions of
those present at the conference were
favorable to the improvement of ship
ping facilities.
The movement originated with the
Chamber of Commerce. At the last
quarterly meeting of that body it was
voted to Invite the other commercial
bodies to send representatives to talk
the matter over. Captain W. H. Mar
ston, one of the trustees of the Cham
ber of Commerce, was appointed
chairman of the joint conference and
E. Scott acted as* secretary. There
were Dresent W. H. Marston, George
A. Newhall, H. Rosenfeld, James
Rolph Jr., C. E. Allen, A. C. Rulofson,
W. S. Casey, T. J. Parsons. George
Renner, F. H. Llppmann

tion developed to the general idea of
improvement. Remarks were made
by Captain Marston, George Renner,

sons.
â¢ Mario J. Ivorson is seeking a divorce

Donald is a paper-hanger.
To be linked to a man who com
"pelled" her to marry him at the point
of a revolver is a condition not pleas

She has therefore filed a suit for the
annulment of her marriage to Herschel

forced to marry him. She says that in
1901, she got a divorce from
him because of his cruelty and that
in July of the following year he met
her and at the point of a revolver
(Vrorjelled her to again become his
.wife. She consented, she says, be
caufp she feared that he would carry
his threat into execution, but left him
within a few days and has ever since
remained hidden from him, fearing
that if he learned of her whereabouts
he. would ehoot her as he said he
would.

THE interchurch .conference on marriage and di
vorce enters the field with an energetic appeal
against divorce. There is no doubt that divorces
have multiplied as the .legal causes for such dissolution
have been increased in the statutes. When the lawmak
ers discovered "incompatibility of temper" as a cause for
divorce they supplied a facility which is responsible for
the rapid increase in legal separations. The churches
look upon marriage as a religious tie entirely, but the
law treats it as a civil contract. Inheritance, titles, prop
erty rights and allsof the material foundation of a home
by marriage, are cognized by the law as affected by the
marriage contract. . . .
It is not well to take a too despairing view of divorce
from the standpoint of public morality. Continence is by
no means a virtue confined to those countries where only
sacramental marriage is recognized. Nor is immorality
a blemish peculiar only to those countries where mar
riage is a civil contract capable of judicial dissolution.
We very much doubt whether a crusade on the subject
will very much improve things.
Herbert Spencer said the force procuring social prog

cause of your present state and of impending disasters."

fessor Schmidt who performed the
delicate operation for removal of
polyps from his Majesty's tiaroat. and
.Â¦upon him are pinned the nation's
' hopes of definitely relieving the popu
)nr monarrh of any and all traces of
the dread disease that killed both of
'-his Imperial parent*. Professor
Schmidt, in whom the whole nvdical
profession of the fatherland has full
confidencf. happily gives the assur
ance that the Kaiser is not suffering
from cancer, even in Incipient form,
and p*-ople are disposed to view the
distinguished surgeon's reputation as
guarantee that he has told the full
and unbiased truth.
Professor Schmidt gained his first
national prominence in 1887. when he
was called into consultation upon the
case of the fated Emperor Frederick,
the present Kaiser's father. Emperor,
then Crown Prince, William was on
his way from Berlin to San Remo to
visit the bedside of his suffering
parent when he stopped off at Frank
fort-on-the-Main, nnd, unbeknown to
alrexcept his immediate suite, invited
Pj-ofessor Schmidt to board the spe
cial train conveying the Crown Prince
from Italy and to make at San Remo
jin exhaustive report upon Emperor
Frederick's condition, about -which
Sir Morell Mackenzie, as events
proved, had bo bitterly misled the
German people. Schmidt, with Pro
fessor Dergmann, Was the first doctor
frankly to diagnose Frederick's mal
ady as cancer. Ever since those dread
"â¢clays he has remained the intimate
friend and adviser of Emperor Wil
liam II. and when his Majesty was
laken ill last year Schmidt was natur
jilly the man to whom be first turned
for expert advice and attention. It re
cently came to light that Professor
Schmidt treated the Kaiser's throat
for two months before finally deciding
to operate on November 9.
Born in Frankfort-on-the Main in
3fc38, Schmidt has continued to live
in the beautiful South German
rnetropolis ever since. He completed
liis early medical studies in Goettin
pen, Vienna, Utrecht, Berlin, London
and Paris â a unique international rec
ord â and became a specialist in dis
eases of the nose, throat and lungs.
He was given his title of professor in
1692 "and was made a privy medical
, councillor in 1 893. He has written
rrtensively on medical subjects, a
.treatise on "Consumption of the
Throat" being a standard text book
in many languages. He has not prac
ticed in later years, having transferred
his lucrative clientele to a younger
Frankfort assistant. Professor Schmidt
occasionally consults in extraordinar
ily important cases. He Is known in
Frankfort as an extremely hard man
to get to. Since the Kaiser's late ill
ness he hÂ»Â» become more of a recluse
than ever, being especially careful to
-guard against anything capable of be
ing twisted into an expression of opin
ion upon the Etatus and progress of
the delicate national issue Intrusted

smelt his breath and ran her dainty
hand through his hair. She thought
she felt a lump on the side of his
head and examined the part careful
ly. Then, as if an inspiration had
seized her, she drew out one of her
hat pins and jabbed it several times
into the case's right leg. There wad

any kind.
"This is very simple," said she, "the
injuries which this man has received
on the left side of the head have

The case is very simple." With that
she bowed herself out with a gracious
air.

THE discovery of Alaska' as a land of great re
sources has not been completed. Nome brought
first io the front its wealth in tundra gold. TKe
great plant at Douglass Island, with its vast array of
stamps, has shown its richness in auriferous material
otherwise bestowed by nature. Its future as a producer
of copper on a large scale would seem to be assured.
Deposits of coal and of tin ore have been found. The an
nual output of fisheries is very valuable. Alaska has fer
tile soil and its agricultural possibilities are, at least, re
spectable. Many minerals undoubtedly abide in its
sands, ledges and rivers that have not yet been found in
paying quantities. But since the time when the United
States supposed that Alaska was principally valuable for
its seal fisheries discovery has been quite steady.-
Another stage in the advancement of knowledge of
Alaska has just been reached by the United States Geo
logical Survey, which has undertaken to give to the
world some definite understanding aboufc-4he petroleum
deposits in our most northern territory. Scientists have
maintained for some years that the oil sands of the Pa
cific Coast extend, practically unbroken, from Mexico to
Alaska. There are large gaps in this great distance be
tween points that have not yet developed oil. The breaks
may be filled in at some future time by intelligent pros
pectors.
What the United States Geological Survey finds to say
about petroleum in Alaska, through the medium of a pub
lication just issued from the press in the "Economic
Geology" series, possesses public interest.
In the Controller Bay region, an indentation of the
coast about 100 miles west of Mount St. Elias, petroleum
seepages are very numerous. Those that are best known
are situated about four miles east of Katalla.. Another
group of seepages- is at the headwaters of Burls Creek,
where the petroleum may be seen oozing from the joints
and bedding planes of the carbonaceous and glauconitic
shales that are exposed in the deep ravines. There are
seepages also on a small stream between Burls Creek and
Bering River; seepages are. also found in the peninsula
between Bering Lake and Controller Bay and in the
region west of Katalla; also in the Nitchawak region,
and there are a number along the' banks of the small
creeks that enter the Little Nitchawak River from the
north. Several wells have been drilled in the Controller
Bay region and oil was discovered at depths of 250 and
350 feet. At the last mentioned depth the petroleum
broke through the soil and spouted above the top of the*
derrick. Several other wells have been drilled concern
ing which no very definite information is supplied by the
Geological Survey.
Petroleum from a well near Katalla has been analyzed
and it is reported by the Geological Survey "to be clearly
a refining oil of the same general nature as Pennsylvania
petroleum." At Cape Yaktag, about twenty-five miles
east of Controller Bay, the oil field extends for about
twenty-five miles eastward from the mouth of the Yak
tag River, which is the eastermost of the longer streams
reaching the ocean near Cape Yaktag.
In the Cook Inlet region there are gas springs and
seepages of oil. Where the seepages are the oil may be
seen oozing from the cracks in the rocks or coming from
the soil. On the east shore of Enochkin Bay a good
seepage was seen at a spot that is below the water at
high tide. The flow of petroleum is so strong that the
oil collects in large blotches and even covers the entire
surface of a pool.
At one point petroleum issues from a crevice in a rock
that is in Jurassic shale. There are a number of large
oil springs at Oil Bay. From the bottom of one of these
springs the petroleum is almost constantly flowing. It is
frequently possible to skim several quarts of petroleum
from the surface of a pool. About two miles west of the
beach at Dry Bay is a gas spring. Oil and gas springs
are on the north shore of Chinitua Bay. A well at Oil
Bay is reported to have struck a flow of fifty barrels of
petroleum at a depth of about 500 feet. A strong flow of
water shut off the oil.
There, is also a petroleum field > at Cold Bay on the
south shore of the Alaska Peninsula, at the southwest
end of. Shelikof Strait, where wells have been drilled.
There is evidently Alaska- petroleum. The quantity is
not fully determined.

SINCE this republic went into business and estab
lished relations with the family of nations a large
number of writers on civics and a still larger num
ber of persons who arc experts in guessing at the value of
power and glory have held that the office of President of
the United States is the best thing in sight.
. American patriotism has eagerly accepted this judg
ment, and we rejoice in boasting that our President out
classes any other executive in the world, whether he get
bis job by election or has it probated to him as. a dynas
tic heir. It is the biggest of big things, and the President
sits at the head of the table in this world of governments,
good, bad and indifferent. Our President, at the same
time that he can give kings and emperors cards and
spades and beat them at any game of government, is a
plain citizen, destined when his term ends to be an ex
emplary citizen only. Some ex-Presidents have been
elected to the office of road supervisor, and one, the
younger Adams, was sent to Congress and stayed there
until he died.
Though the duration of the power of a President is
limited by law and custom no one has refused the job
when offered to him and not one has resigned it after he
got it. Its attainment is not without difficulty. The am
bition of rivals has to be reckoned with and that fickle
jade, public opinion by name "and changeable as the wind,
has to be watched and courted. Up to this time there
has been no cut across lots to the office. A man who
wanted it has had to choose his path and travel it afoot,
dispensing wisdom and light and sweetness as he went
on. But we live in a period of flux and change. . Clergy
men are inclined to flout at Adam as a myth; William
Tell and the league of Rutli and the apple and Gesler's
cap have gone glimmering; we all believe that 'Washing
ton did not lie about that cherry tree, but that Dr. Weems
did when he invented the story, and lots of things that
our fathers took for granted are now in dispute and many
of them disproved.
It is no wonder that, moved by the spirit of the age, our
esteemed contemporary Mr. Hearst should side step all of
the traditions about achieving the Presidency and make
a cash offer. Money talks and its conversation is agree
able to several kinds of politicians. Money also makes
the mare go, and why not use it to impress the primaries
with the excellences of character enjoyed by Mr. Hearst?
The readers of his papers know already that he is the
foremost American, for he says so himself, and what bet
ter evidence. can be had? If a man is not himself aware
that he is the head of a class, who should be?
Unfortunately there are peode who do not read Mr.
Hearst's papers and are without light as to his merits.
A Presidential campaign is too short to get them in the
habit of reading what he says about himself. So he has
wisely adopted a short cut. It is said that many mis
sionary stations among the heathen pay a monthly salary
to all heathens who accept Christianity, and also that
when one of them becomes a Christian for wages he
sticketh closer than a brother who is not on the pay roll.
Why should not Mr. Hearst put a majority of the Demo
cratic party on the pay roll and clinch their devotion to
the rights of man by stipendiary means? . , ,
Getting the Presidency in that way comes high, but he
lias the ambition and the money. It is just reported that
in Indiana he made a lump offer in two installments of a
half million for the delegation and threw in the Gover
norship of the State as a make weight. Mr. Sims, to
whom the option was first offered, declined it. But the
Hearst campaign in that State against the reprehensible
trusts which are corrupting our politics goes on, which is
evidence that the job refused by Sims has not gone
begging.
Mr. Henderson seems to be in a position to furnish in
formation on the subject. He has had a long training
in bearding in their several dens the various lions of cor
ruption. His experience began in breaking mules in the
Tilden campaign and no doubt his skill and virtue have
grown as the years have gone by. Whether he is the
one selected by Mr. Hearst to rebuke corrupt politics, for
a consideration, or not it is certain that the rebuke is
going up and down Indiana and working day and night.
From Terre Haute to The Shoals, and Plymouth to Posy
County, political corruption is on the run like horse
thieves when the Grand Jury meets?
Mr. Hearst is the first candidate for the Presidency
willing to spend a half million to induce people to abhor
the opposition. If he hold his lick the party in many
States will be in a state of eruptive abhorrence that will
amount to a regular political smallpox. It is with sin
cere interest in our fellow citizen that we notify him
that abhorrence requires inducements in some parts of
his native State. The California Democrats do not go
around abhorring as much as they ought to. The abhor
rence fund is needed right here and right now.

In the archives and is no more heard
of. Ab supreme head of the executive
his majesty has to use his autocratic
power much more frequently, because
In the ordinary course of administra
tion, whenever it is considered desir
able to make an exception to the exist
ing laws and regulations, the matter
has to be submitted for supreme per
mission by the minister concerned. As
there is nothing which corresponds to
a cabinet, the ministers have no joint
responsibility, and the only- center in
which the activity of all the different
departments converges is the Emperor
himself. He may. of course, order that
a matter is to be submitted to the
committee of ministers, or he may
summon a number of personages in
whom he has confidence to discuss a
question in his presence, but this forms
no part of the ordinary method of con
ducting business.
Thus the Czar who attends to his
duties and has a great capacity for
work can control thoroughly the great
legislative and executive machine by~
which he governs his empire; and ; as
he possesses many unofficial means of
obtaining information, any minister
who should systematically attempt to
deceive him would very soon be found
out. With regard to foreign affairs he
is sure to be exceptionally well in
formed, because all crowned heads con
sider that the relations of their country
with foreign powers require their per
sonal supervision, and to this rule the
Russian autocrats form no exception.
As soon as a political incident happens
in which Russia is interested, a mem
orandum is carefully prepared ln v the
foreign department, describing what
has occurred, explaining in what way
Russian interests are affected, and sug
gesting the line of action to be adopt
ed, and this document is submitted to
the Emperor. His Majesty may discuss
the question with the minister if he
thinks fit. or he may read the paper
alone and send It back with, his re
nvirks and orders written on the mar
gin. In either case the minister gets
his instructions and acts accordingly.
Of late an unusual departure has been
made from this procedure. Finding It
necessary to concentrate locally the di
rection of affairs In the Far East, the
Emperor created a vice-royalty, with
special cowers, and placed under the
orders of the viceroy not only the civil,
military and naval authorities, but
also the Russian diplomatic representa
tives in China, Korea and Japan. Ad
miral Alexleff. on whom this important
post was conferred, corresponds direct
ly with the Emperor outside of the for
eign department, so that if the Russian
Embassador in London, Paris or Berlin
declares that he does not know what is
going on in the I^ar East, it must not
be hastily assumed that he is using
merely diplomatic language.
How, then, has it come about that an
autocrat, who is a sincere lover of
peace and who has the control of af
fairs in his own hands, has brought his
country to the verge of war? In the
first place it must be remembered that
autocrats, like ordinary statesmen in
other forms of government, do not al
ways foresee the ultimate consequences
of their decisions, and are liable to
find themselves unexpectedly in a sit
uation from which war Is the only
means of exit consistent with the na
tional interests and the national honor.
Even the pacific Mr. Gladstone let
himself be drawn into the Egyptian
campaign, and afterward drifted dan
gerously near to a great war with
Russia. It must be remembered, fur
ther, that the autocratic form of gov
ernment has its drawbacks as well as
its advantages in matters of foreign
policy. It does not require to watch
and be guided by the ever changing
currents of public opinion, and it can
therefore adopt a politique de longue
haleine; but It is not nearly so inde
pendent of popular sentiment as is
commonly supposed, for its strength
lies in its being the representative of
national conceptions and national aspi
rations; and if it fails to be true to
these it weakens itself. He would be
a very bold Czar who would sacrifice a
great national interest to love of peace
or any other personal feeling. If ever
a Czar was justified in disregarding the
views of the ultra-patriotic section of
his subjects it was Alexander II. when
he accepted the decisions of the Con
gress of Berlin in order to avoid a great
European struggle: but there is no
doubt that that wise, courageous act
diminished his popularity and prestige.
Whether Nicholas II. has inherited all
the civic courage of his grandfather
remains to be sÂ«-en. If he desires peace
in the sense of being ready to sacrifice
to it certain material and political in
terests, he should lose no time in trans
ferring the conduct of the diplomatic
negotiations from his viceroy to his
foreign office. The gallant admiral
may be as wise, prudent and concili
atory as his friends represent him to
be, but he hr â¢ not the experience and
traditional dexterity of the Foreign Of
fice oSlcials, and he seems to have con
ducted the negotiations hitherto In
such a way* that a diplomatic retreat
can now hardly be effected without
some loss of prestige. Under the di
rection of the Foreign Office the stra
tegic operation would be carefully
veiled and the loss of prestige, if un
avoidable, would be reduced to a min
imum. â The London Times.
that finds cause for divorce. The relation of marriages
like every other human relation of whatever degree,
requires a persistent spirit of regard for other interests
than those of self. Every incident of incompatibility in
business relations, in social contacts,. originates in refusal
to-consider the interests of others. A training for per
manence in the marriage contract therefore is not special.
It is the same as all training for. covenant keeping, and
must be in the sentiments and character. We question
whether inculcation of the mysteries that attach to the
idea of the sacramental marriage will produce much im
mediate impression, while we recognize the devoted pur
pose of those who propose it. It may be said broadly
that the good citizen has in him the elements of a good
husband and father, and citizenship must be built up as
a part of the system of divorce reform.

punished simply because either was in
a position to commit a crime. In

operation of intent and act. there must
have been some overt act either in the
attempt to commit a crime or the
actual commission of one. Under cer

Buried Herculaneum.
The more complete excavation of
Pompeii carried on in recent years has
been so rich in results and has so great,
ly enlarged our knowledge of the life
and art of the Roman Empire, that
the attention of archaeologists ia now
turned to the other buried city, which
has been hitherto neglected. Superfi
cially, the ruins of Herculaneum are
much less important, but the place is
known to have contained some rich
villas and some public buildings of
consequence which may prove to have
been as well preserved beneath the
ashes of Vesuvius as were some of
those in Pompeii. At all events, the
proposed excavation is of interest,
though the project of international co
operation does not appear very prac
ticable. The Italian Government, how
ever, ha* accomplished so much in
archaeological research of late that
the means for this undertaking will
probably be found.
Women at the Wheel.
Lack of concentration Is the most
common failure of all among motor
women. If a woman cannot concen
trate in every day things, she cannot
concentrate when she motors. The
weakness that causes a woman to read
the same page of a book twice to get
its meaning, that makes her ask an
eager question about the detail of a
story which one has just carefully ex
plained, that leads her mind a will-o'
the-wisp trip around the hem of the
conversation, is the same weakness
which, in motoring, keeps her looking
too long at an attractive bit of scenery,
or turning her attention for a moment
wholly to something that has been said,
or for a single instant lifting her hand
from the brake. Generally speaking,
a woman who is not a good listener
will not be a good chauffeuse. She can
not cancentrate. And Incidentally,
that is why, if a woman has learned
to do any one thing well, she Is a better
motor pupil. If she can play the piano,
if she can play bridge, if she can paint,
even if she can typewrite, she will, ten
to one, be a good chaufteuse. It is the

OPEN BIENNIAL SESSION.
It will thus be seen that the Stablemen's
Cn'.on had given the owners no caus* what
ever for their arbitrary action, and had not
intended to demand any change whatever in
existing conditions.
A numltcr of stable owners refused to Join
with their fellow members of the association
in enforcing the "open 6hop" policy and are
to-Â«?ay conducting their stables under union
regulations, governing employment.
The union also desires to emphasize the fact
that it has not and will not countenance vio
lence or disorder on the part of its members,
and that It will certainly assist in the prose
cution of any member who is guilty of disre
garding the union's orders in this respect.
On February 22 the *ecr*tary of the Stable
and Carnage Owners' Association visited all
the stable* of members and poÂ»ted "open shop"
notices. A committee from the union, accom
panied by the secretary of the I-alx>r Council,
called on the board of dircctorr. of the associa
tion the following day and asked the . reason
for the posting of these notices. The commlt
tt-emen were Informed that the association
believed that the union was about to p-regent
new demand*, calling for increased wages and
other concessions; that the owners had
decided not to grant further conces
sions and ftp.rl determined to an
ticipate the union's demands by adopting the
â¢'op^n shop" policy. The owners. In support
of their contentions, ehowed the committee
whit they claimed wae a copy of new de
mands' adopted by the union a short time be
for*-. and which were to go into effect May 1.,
The union's representatives informed \ the
owners that they were misinformed regarding
the union's intention and that, while it Was
true that the union had had under considera
tion certain modification? of the existing sched
ule, the copy exhibited by the owners, which
had bt-t-n printed and extensively circulated by
them, was widely at variance with the sched
ule as approved by the union. Furthermore,
aJthough these amendments to the existing
schedule had been favorably acted upon by
the union, that action wa* not final, the union
having placed the entire matter In the hands
of a representative committee, with instruc
tions to Investigate the situation and report
upon the advisability of asking the owners to
grant the concession*. This committee, after
carefully canvassing the situation, decided not
to present the demands to the owners and to
rvcemmend that the existing schedule be con
tinued in operation for the rest 'of the year.
After maklrg these statements to the board
of -lirectors of the Stable Owners' Association,
the committee then asked the owners to enter
Into a formal agreement with thÂ« union to
continue the existing schedule for a year. The
directors refused to do this and also declined
even to make a verbal agreement to that
effect, though strongly urged to do so by the
secretary of the I>abor Council. The owners
agÂ»in declared that it was their Intention to
adhere to the "open shop" policy. â¢
After this fruitless conference had ended,
member? of the Owners" Association Immedi
ately began to discbarge union stablemen and
hire non-union men. in some Instances whole
crews being discharged at once. This policy
was continued until the union, in self-defense,
was compelled to take action and order that
ite members be called out In the remaining
stables where the owners refused Individually
\a agree to maintain the old conditions with
out change on either side.
The union desires to direct especial atten
tion to tie fact that the Stable and Carriage
Owners' Association and the Stablemen's
Union at thÂ« beginning of tne year agreed
upon a schedule of hours and wages, - this
schedule having been arranged through the
mediation of the Labor Council, and that thnt
schedule contained important concessions asked
by th<? owners and gTanted by the union upon
the advice of the Labor Council. This was
the schedule the committeemen asked the
association directors to formally agree to at
the confeience on February 23. the owners*
representative!* having refused to enter into
a written agreement when the schedule was
finally accepted by both sides at the beginning
of the ye*r. although Its provisions were in
force in all stables up to the time the "open
shop" notices were posted.
To the PeoplÂ« of San Francl*co: In view of
the Tact that there wms to be considerable
misunderstanding among our citizens regani-
Jn* the causes of the present lockout in a.
nviiuher of the stables of this -city, the Stable
men's Union desires to make this statement
of the actual circumstances pr'-sceding this con
troversy:
Thomas F. Finn, president of
Stablemen's Union No. S760 of this
city, last night issued the following
statement regarding the differences
existing between the owners of sta
bles and the union of stablemen:
OVERTURES REJECTED
Officers of Organisation' De
clare Strike wjs Precipi
tated by the {Employers
The neatest, daintiest, prettiest stuff
of its sort ever turned out is "A Run
away Girl," one of the Daly musical
comedies, revived at the Tivoli last
night. It is not quite the "Runaway
Girl" of the Daly's as we got it at the
California last . year, but still a good
performance. Not that that mattered
much last, night. The dental student
graduates of '04 took the house and
made things hum, and â¢Â¦Â¦"A Runaway
Girl" was voted, by hand and heel, a
record breaking success.
Musically, the Tivoli performance
wholly outranks the Daly's. They
have more voices and better, as with
any musical comedy company that
happens along. Chiefly the difference
lies in the fit of the parts, glove fitting
with the New Yorkers. This is where
the chief difficulty of the Daly comedies
lies. They were written to fit. For ex
ample, nothing short of a 300-ponnder
could fill out Professor Tamarind's
part. George Fortescue had 'em all
and more. Good as he always is, Ted
dy Webb's Professor tipped the scales
a good 200 pounds short. In fact,, Mr.
Webb is cut out for John Slavin's role
of the Jockey, Flipper, two sizes too
tight for Ferris Hartman, who has it.
The runaway girl herself Is Misi de
Filippe, who is piquant and dainty in
the role. She has several pretty songs,
and sings them charmingly. Better and
better Is Miss Esther King, who has
the part of Alice the maid, and Annie
Myers returns as a sturdily amusing
cockney Italian lady. As before said
Hartman is the jockey, and he succeeds
in amusing in a role not altogether
his kind. His song, "Follow the Man
From Cook's," will probably be In all
the local whistles before the week is
out. Webb is clever In his wayâ not
itsâ in the part v &Â£- the Professor, and
Cunningham and his four piratical
troubadours make much picturesque
and vocal fun. George Chapman is both
useful and ornamental as Guy Stan
ley. He has a voice, savoir faire and
agreeable stage presence. He was en
cored several times while singing of
the kind of girl he wished to marry.
Schuster, Aspland, Bessie Tannehill and
the rest are spread over the huge cast
and do .their best for things. The
piece is very prettily staged.
"A Runaway Girl," in short, will well
repay a visit. An unusually large house
heartily enjoyed the piece last night,
with encore after encore for the many
good songs.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON. *
her scenes withT>urkin were charmins
ly done. Perhaps the best bit of work
was that of Miss Frances Starr, v/ho
was irresistible as Estelle. Miss Starr
brings an intelligence and delicacy into
her impersonations that meet with the
unqualified approval -of her auditors,
all of whom must be her friends, judg
ing by the applause with which she
was greeted at every turn. John B.
Maher only added fresh laurels to his
reputation as a painstaking and able
actor in the part of Joulin and Miss
Marie Howe was admirable as Madame
Joulin.. Miss Juliet Crosby must not be
lost sight of in her small part of Mme.
Breneull and as usual she acted with
a grace and tact that are all her own.
Conness, Osborne and Hill iard were all
that could be desired in their parts and
aided in the presentation of a harmon
ious production.
Mrs. Henry Lehman telephoned
from her residence. 722 Rhode Island
street, last Saturday e%'eningr to the
nearest police station that her'hus
band was pursuing her with a knife
and threatening to take her life, and
the patrolman who immediately re-
Mr. Debnorty could not devise logi
cal explanation of his conduct, and
Judge Mogan ordered him to appear
this morning for sentence.
Frank Harris, whose long residence
in "The Home for the Weary," on
Leidesdorff street, has earned for him
undisputed recognition as the star
lodger of that select establishment,
appeared before Judge Mogan as com
plainant against Charles Debnorty,
and the charge- was battery.
It was Saturday afternoon, â¢ Mr.
Harris stated, and he was seated in
the reading room of "The Rest," stor
ing his mind with war intelligence
from the Yalu. when the newspaper
was rudely snatched from his hands,
and his face severely punched by Mr.
Debnorty, who had received no provo
cation whatever for the attack. Al
though his soul was aflame with the
pugnacity that the graphically written
report of a fierce battle never fails to
arouse in the masculine reader. Mr.
Harris discreetly refrained from retal
iating In kind upon' Mr. Debnorty,
who was by many years the younger,
and by numerous pounds the heavier
of the two. ' .. "
Policeman Winsler was not in offi
cial garb when William Hebbard shuf
fled up to him on Market street and
requested to be provided with 10 cents
"For what purpose?" asked the
plain-clothes man?"
"To eat wid," replied Â¦William; "I'm
jist perishin' wid hunger."
"I'll do better than give you a dime,"
said the officer. Then he collared Wil
liam and marched him into a restau
rant, where he instructed a waiter to
give him all the food he could tuck
away. But not a mouthful could Wil
liam eat. although the most tempting
dainties in the place were set before
him. So his host ran him in.
"Gimme me medicin' an* lemme
hide me head," said William to Judge
Fritz, "an 1 don't be afraid to make de
dose strong. De idear uv an' old-time
cadger like me mistakin' a cop fer a
cit fills me wid desire fer punishment.
Sock It ter me. Wot do I git?"
v "Thirty days," said his Honor.
"An' t'irty years wouldn't be a minlt
too much." muttered William ere he,
figuratively, kicked himself back to
If the declaration was facetiously in
tended it failed of effect, for Judge
Mogan didn't smile at all and neither
Bailiff Hlckey nor Clerk pro tern.
"Jack" Rice seemed to see the pun.
The charge of having lottery tickets
in his possession was promptly proved
and Mariner Gaston paid $5 for his
restoration to freedom.
"I'm rated a. b. on the books of the
steamer Acapulco," said P. Gaston,
"and you'll find that I'm no ordinary
seaman."
Pat McGrath was so indiscreet as to
change his base of begging operations
from Market street to Chinatown,
where he was caught in the act of
accosting coolies for alms.
"I wasn't beggin' nothin'." Pat
pleaded to Judge Mogan, "but was in
quirin' where I could buy some good
whisky."
"Tush. tush. Patrick." said his
Honor; "you shouldn't try to deceive
this court with specious pleading, for
you have been here often enough to
have learned that no defense at all is
better than one that will not hold
water. When you come here to-morrow
morning I'll send you back to the dear
old home that nestles at the base of
Telegraph Hill and see that you are
kept there throushout the gladsome
summer season." ,
Judge Cabaniss .held Thomas Fitz
patrick and Edward Daly for grand
larceny, with bail fixed at $2000 apiece.
They were convicted of steaiing hose â
not the kind that is displayed in the
show windov.'B of dry-goods stores â
from the Oregon Railroad and Naviga
tion Company'6 wharf.
After he had been cleared of a
charge of malicious mischief by Judge
Fritz. John McElroy ventilated his
inebriety in the corridors of the Hall
of Justice until a policeman escorted
him to the top floor and charged him
with drunkenness in a public place. He
will reappear before his Honor Judge
Fritz this morning.
David de Costa, sneak thief and
"stool pigeon." was given six months
by Judge Mogan for swindling a poor
widow out of $2 by means of the coun
terfeit bill trick. He pleaded guilty to
petty larceny to avoid trial and prob
able conviction on a more serious
charge.
James H. Wells and William Uhl
were intoxicated and had a' tin box in
their possession, when a policeman saw
them emerge from the dwelling house
at fc57 Howard street, and investiga
tion disclosed the fact that the recepta
cle was filled with heirlooms and arch
ives and other things belon:?tng to in
mates of the dwelling, witbout whose
permission it had been taken. Charge
of larceny to be heard on May 13.
Frank Healy invited Dan Hughes to
break bread with him in a restaurant
out Bernal Heights way and then re
fused to pay for the food. He was
fined $10 by Judge Cabaniss.
Among the victim? of the larcenous
practice of H. W. Davis was J. D.
Wilson, the mulatto proprietor of a
Pacific-street dance hall, whose flowing
mustache and diamond-embellished
sweater of many colors made him a
conspicuous figure In the c mrtroom of
Judge Fritz, Davis was p-?ntenced to
six months' Imprisonment f "r petty lar
ceny and Wilson seemed to approve the
sentence.
Dixon. who is a blacksmith, entered an
additional charge of robbery against
"The Terror." claiming ; that $3 had
been taken from his pocket after the
assault, but he failed to prove the ac
cusation before Judge Mogan.
- Thomas Barnes, who has earned and
proudly wears the sobriquet of "The
Terror of North Beach," will be sent
eneed to-day for battery upon J. D.
Dlxon's head with a wagon-spoke.
â¢ Tto sixteen -year-old girls, Mary
Vy^e-z. and Florence Fernandez, were
sen* -to St. Catherine's Home by Judge
Fritz, to whom their parents had com
llsr'.r.e'J of their waywardness.
â¢in â¢ his possession for safe keeping
aftout $3000 worth of jewelry. Instead
Â¦of keeping the treasures in his safe,
however, he pawned t^iem.
B.'C. Park was held in $500 to an
swei* for felony embezzlement. He
purchased a clothing store on Sixth
f.-net from Mary Sidlowski, who left
â¢ frank Anderson, colored, was also
Â«-sr-<njsed of vagrancy, but he did not
â¢loOk the r>art. His outer garments
were of baby-blue color, fashionable
â¢cut and fine texture, his shoes were of
patent leather, and a massive chunk of
"â¢Ip"o!ished glass glinted from the crimson
n&cktie that partly hid the yellow and
Vtec-n.. stripes of his shirt-bosom. But
.<Ke"corr:r>!aining policeman Â¦warned the
1-oiirt not to be deceived by Ander
son's tout ensemble, as he was an ex-
Vo'nvict and had been arrested with a
uineÂ«teen-year-old white girl whom, it
v.Â£s- suspected, he had enticed from her
at San Jose. The young woman,

Never before In the of the
city has an election been so Quiet and
unless it is livened up this week It is
believed a very light vote will be cast.
SAM JOSE, May 9. â A week from
to-day occurs the city election. The
campaign has been one of the quiet
est in the history of the city and but
very little enthusiasm has been
aroused. It will be a contest between
the Hayes and Mackenzie forces. The
Hayes forces are back of the city ad
ministration, which has been in full
power in the city for the last two
years.
The administration is running on
what is known as the Citizens' ticket.
Those on the ticket are: Mayor,
George D. Worswick; City Clerk, Jo
seph A. Beloli Jr.; Treasurer, H. D.
Mathews; Councilman, Second Ward,
J. F. Carey; Councilman, Third Ward,
Wesley L. Pieper. All of these, with
the exception of Pieper, are now hold-
Ing office.
The opposition is running what is
known as the People's ticket A. E.
Shumate, at present City" Superintend
ent of Schools, is the. nominee for
Mayor; City Clerk, Roy Walter;
Treasurer, Joseph A. Lotz; Council
man, Second . Ward t H. W. Otter;
Councilman, Third Ward, D. J. Mc-
Ginley.
Headquarters are maintained by the
Worswick people in the theater build
ing and they have been doing some ac
tive work for the last two weeks. Last
Monday evening they held their main
meeting of ; the campaign and each
evening they hold a ward meeting.
Saturday last the Shumate forces
opened headquarters- in the' Knox
block. As yet they have held no meet
ing, but it is believed they will in
augurate their campaign during the
coming week.
There is buÂ£ one office for which
there are three .candidates k and that
is the office of Treasurer. Alex P.
Murgotten' is running independent of
the two tickets for the place.
Hayes and Mackenzie Forces Are Op
posing, but Campaign Is

Castleton stables in .Kentucky ran
first, second and third in the Crotona
handicap at Morris Park to-day, while
another of their breeding won the last
race. Both of the Keenes saw a dou
ble triumph Â¦ of their race horses.
Again, as in ,the Toboggan handicap,
was Hurst Park the hero to-day. This
time, however, while he won, a merry
pace was set by his relative. Dolly
Spanker. To-day he made all the
running, and it was only in the last
furlong that he showed indications of
"'coming back." Then it was that
Odom, who had ridden Hurst Park
with patience, called on him and his"
response was generous, he winning by
two lengths. Dolly Spanker lasted
long enough to save second place from
Kohinoor. Thus three Kingston colts
were first, second and third. The pace
was fast, as the track was still "dead"
from a heavy rain this morning. Sav
able and High Chancellor were added
to the starters and ran fairly well, the
latter, however/getting off badly.

Martin Canole is being kept busy for
his fight on the 2Qth with "Battling"
Nelson, and though the date is Just ten
days off he devotes his whole time to
light gymnasium work and shadow
boxing.
Jack Burke, who is preparing for his
match with Rufe Turner two days
later, will act asNsparring partner for
Canole as soon as the latter decides to
begin heavy boxing.
Canole still feels confident of his abil
ity to outbox the vanquisher of Spider
Welch, but admits that he expects no
easy time of it.
Canole is even now not far above the
stipulated 'weight and gives this as his
reason for delaying the road work and
boxing. Both men, however, are stead
ily digging into the punching bags. '
Jack Burke is matched to meet Rufo
Turner before the Stockton Athletic
Club on the 18th of this month.
Champion Rodenbach arrived in the
city last night. He announces that
his match with Sam Berger 4 of the
Olympic Club will be at Mechanics'
Pavilion on May 25.

Important facts and circumstances will

The spot where young "Wentz a boci>
was found is isolated, although not far
from a public road and very near the
place where his horse was found. ThÂ«
body is remarkably well preserved W
have Iain in its present position for so
many months, but the features are not
recognizable. The identification was
made by clothing and by articles young
Wentz was known to have had in hiÂ»
possession. His spurs, riding trouser*
and leggings were readily identified,
while within a few feet of his body
were a blue-bordered handkerchief
bearing the initials "E. L. W.." a re
volver, three chambers of which had
been discharged, eyeglasses worn by
the young man and his cuffs, from
which a pair of valuable buttons had
been removed.
The body lay as if Wentz had fallen
after a struggle.
The head rested on a piece of log.
while one leg was doubled back under
the body. The position Indicates iriur
der. There are holes In the coat that
appear to have been made by bullets.
Every Indication points to a battle be
tween Wejitz and his murderer, in
which the victim had fired three shots
from his revolver before he was killed.
After receiving the fatal shots he
evidently staggered back from where
he had taken his stand and fell, thus
accounting for the distance between
where his body lay and where his re
volver and eyeglasses were found.
What is regarded as the most probable
theory is that young Wentz was a vic
tim of moonshiners. It is known
a band of these men cherished enmity
toward him.

None other than members of the com

to-night that the sub-committee on

in favor of the retirement of at least
four of the present Bishops. These
will be, it is said by a prominent lead

and Vincent. 73 years respectively.
Bishop Andrews is the same age as
Bishop Merrill, who has asked to be
retired. If this forecast is correct at
least seven new Bishops will be elect
ed by the present General Conference.
No action was taken on the sub-com

the sub-committee on age limit.
Book Concern affairs were consid
ered by the committee on that sub

taken on the question of the consoli

It is quite probable, however, accord
ing to the best information obtainable,
that the whole subject will be re
ferred to a select commission to re
port to the next general conference
four years hence. .
. It is the opinion of many delegates
that there will be a change in pub
lishers and that Dr: G. P. Mains will
be chosen to succeed Dr. Homer Ea
ton of New York and that both the
Eastern and Western publishing busi
ness will be put in under the direction
of Dr. Mains, thus making him sole
agent of the Book Concern. At the
present time the western section of
the publishing, business is in the hands
of Jennings & Pye.

helps to uplift men and not pull them
down."
This expression was received with ap
plause by the delegates and the gal
leries.
A motion by Dr. S. L. Beiler to refer
the resolution to the committee on
state of the church was carried. In the
opinion of many prominent delegates
this disposes of the matter finally.
Rev. Dr. J. R. Day, president of the
College Presidents' Association, offered
a resolution arguing against the open
ing of the American University at
Washington, D. C, except under the
original plan of endowment, viz: When
it shall have a fund of $5,000,000. The
paper was referred to the committee on
education.
CHANGES PROPOSED.
Rev. R. F. Bishop presented a reso
lution to make certain changes in the
discipline that would provide a more
simple method of terminating the mem
bership of persons living in "habitual
neglect of their obligations to the
church." Dr' Buckley raised a point
of order against this resolution, say
ing that it took away from members
the right of trial by committee and of
appeal.' It was finally referred to the
committee on the state of the church.
Judge Sibley erf Ohio offered an im
portant resolution on the subject of
divorce. He wanted paragraph 39 of
the discipline changed to read as fol
lows: *-. â
"No divorce, except for adultery, final
desertion or cruelty or neglect, such as
to compel an innocent party to sep
arate from the offender, shall be re
garded by the church as morally law
ful, and none of our ministers or lay
men shall solemnize marriage where
there is a divorced wife or husband
living, unless the divorce was granted
upon grounds hereinbefore specified.
But this regulation does not apply in
cases where divorced parties are seek
ing remarriage."
Judge Sibley -spoke to this resolu
tion at some length, saying that he
believed the present law was not
founded on sound ' views of scriptural
teaching in relation to the subject, or
well founded in ethics. This resolu
tion, also, was referred to the com
mittee on the state of the church.

The home of Mrs. Bessie Blitz Pax
ton was entered last Thursday after
noon by a would-be burglar, armed
with a revolver, but who was finally
persuaded to leave the premises with
out carrying any property away with
him.
Mrs. Paxton was alone in the house
when it was entered by the thief and
showed much courage and tact, in her
dealings with him. Instead of scream
ing for help she talked quietly with
the intruder and finally persuaded him
that it was better for him that he
leave the house as quickly as possible.
Mrs. Paxton was greatly alarmed
over the incident, but bravely retained
her composure until the man had left
the premises. She describes him as
being rather young, with red hair.
WOMAN SHOWS COURAGE IN
DEALING WITH A BURGLAR
The School Directors yesterday de
cided to appoint Dr. Arthur W. Scott
as principal of the Girls' High School
to succeed Professor Elisha Brooks,
who has presented his resignation, to
take effect at the beginning of the next
school terra.
L>r. Scott was selected from a long
list of applicants for the position after
the members of the board had consult
ed with Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler re
garding the qualifications of the re
spective applicants. It was only after
Dr. "Wheeler had recommended that
Dr. Scott was the best man for the
place that the latter's appointment was
agreed upon. Dr. Scott was also high
ly recommended by Professor Elmer
Brown, Frank Otis, president of the
Alameda Board of Education, and Fred
T. Moore, president of the Geograph
ical Society.
The position is considered to be one
of the most important in the School
Department. It carries with it a salary
of $250 a month and is practically a
life tenure.
Dr. Scott has been principal of the
Alameda High Schools for the last
eleven years, having been elected an
nually during that time. He is pres
ident of the State High School Teach
ers' Association and also president of
the Alameda County High School
Teachers' Club. He was born in San
Francisco forty-seven years ago and
attended the public schools here. He
graduated from the University of
California in 1876 and graduated from
the medical department of the uni\*er
sity in 1S79. He practiced medicine
and was afterward acting assistant
surgeon of the United States army,
serving at Plattsburg Barracks tfnd at
various posts in Arizona during the
campaign against Geronimo. He went
to the Alameda High School as head
of the department of mathematics and
became principal of the school ,in 1893.
Dr. Scott, on account of his train
ing and experience in teaching the
classics, mathematics, English, history
and the sciences, and because of his
acquirements in the modern languages

;k<UE STIRS DEBATE
Maryland Have Temporiz
. ing Effect on Conference
.LOS ANGELES. May 8.â The at
tituSe of the Roman Catholic church
io^yard the public school system of the
â¢J 'tilted States furnished the subject of
a sensational debate in the Methodist
'tj^rreral Conference to-day. While
indre was a strong disposition on the
paw of certain delegates to have the
coherence adopt resolutions commit
ting frt to extreme utterances upon the
subject, there was an overwhelming
teptirrent, as it developed, against any
*ueh action, and the entire matter was
finally disposed of by referring it to a
<ommitte<?, from which it is unlikely
ever to be reported.
.Several other resolutions bearing
upon the subjects of divorce, the ter
mination of memberehiD of neglectful
InembiprF. Sunday closing of the Lewis
and i^lark Exposition, the endowment
"f The American University at Wash
ington, changes in the wording of va
rious paragraphs in the discipline and
*< thet matters of importance to Meth
odists?, were submitted, debated and
referred to proper committees.
Rev. Dr. J. M. King, secretary of the
.Church Extension Society of Philadel
phia, having secured the floor shortly
after the disposition of routine busi
ness this morning, presented a resolu
tion which he asked to be read by the
â¢ . Vkctaiuamsm ax issue.
"Before the proposition, which I pre
sent for the action of the conference,
ie retiJ by the secretary," said Dr.
Kjr.R. "I desire to move the adoption
of thÂ» following statement taken from
"the ej^isc-opal address as the conviction
ajid " expression of opinion of the Gen
t*al Conference":

"â¢This utterance has already awak
ened the hierarchy representatives in
â¢ this city," continued Dr. King. "A se
puichraJ jester si^rr.ingr a communica
tion to the press of this city, P. Har
scit. V. O., has attempted to respond
*n- the absence of higher authority to j
this address of the Bishops."
* Dr. King then read extracts of a let- j
ter written by Vicar General Peter
.JiaVnett of the Roman Catholic diocese
o? -Monterey and Los Angeles, In which
the tatter sought to refute the state
ments made in the above quotations
from the episcopal address, and con
ttnued as follows:

The last few days have redeemed the
deadly dullness of societyâ the activity
presumably resulting from 'imminent
wanderings.
Leading the affairs of the week's end
was James D. Phelan's luncheon on the
lawn of his home on Valencia street.
Under a tent stretched beneath the

Yesterday Miss Jennie Blair was
hostess at a card party and tea, given
in Jionor of Miss Charlotte Land of
Syracuse, guest of Mrs. George Lent.
As at all affairs of Miss Blair's there
was a "go" to the pleasure that distin
guished the afternoon from all too
many of Its fellows. Those who
played cards â bridge, of courseâ were
Miss Land, Mrs. George Lent, Miss
Jennie Hooker, Mrs.' Worthington
Ames, Mrs. Samuel Knight, Mrs. Fred
W. Tallant, Mrs. Latham McMullin,
Mrs. Henry Foster Dutton, Mrs. Han
nah Gale and Mrs. Welty.
The game about over, many friends
called to meet the fair Easterner,
among whom were Miss Katherine
Dillon, Miss Grace Spreckels, Miss Lily
Spreckels, Mrs. Hodgson, Miss Patricia
Cosgrave. Miss Houghton, Mrs. Robert
McCreary, Mrs. Henry L. Dodge, Miss
Bessie Wilson, Miss Bernice Wilson,
Miss Alice Hager and Miss Ethel
Hager.
Mrs. James A. Black of Alameda en

THE FUTURE REVEALED. THE PAST
DISCLOSED.
The Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatise, that is
so electrifying the world to-day. He is no
imitator. His work is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works in the open
light.
He is as "conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression' and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full Hfe reading for $1. A test
is of little value; when the mind Is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on -him for a flrst-
class clairvoyant reading. . Â¦
He asks you no .questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you arevhelr to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF". LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest tbe remedy. ,

He immediately found a policeman
and reported the matter. He said he
was afraid Mrs. Kleimenhagen would
yet kill him if she was not arrested.
He complained that the police had
done nothing to arrest the woman and
was referred to Captain Martin.
Mrs. Kleimenhagen now resides on
Fifth street, between Howard and Fol
som. Graves fears that she will
Ehow fight when the police attempt
to arrest her.
Richard Graves, an employe of Wells,
Fargo and Co. in the freight depart
ment at the ferry, for the second time
came near ito death at the hands of
Jennie L. Kleimenhagen last night. He
claims that Mrs. Kleimenhagen chased
him three blocks on Market street with
a revolver and attempted to shoot him.
The trouble culminated over a separa
tion between the man and woman, who
had been living together for some time.
On the 6th of this , month Mrs.
Kleimenhagen lay in wait for Graves at
his lodging house at 6% Sacramento
street and threw the contents of a bot
tle of carbolic acid at his face. Graves'
hands were badly burned by the acid.
The two people had been living to
gether at 6% Sacramento street for
more than two years. On March 2S
Graves left the woman. A few days
later she sought him at the ferry where
he was employed. The woman was
inclined to raise trouble, but was in
duced to declare a truce by the payment
of $10 to her by Superintendent Thomp
son of "Wells, Fargo and Co. Thomp
son acted as mediator for Graves, who
proffered the coin. Mrs. Kleimenhagen
took the money and agreed to let
Graves have his peace.
The acid throwing episode occurred
a few days later. Graves secured a
warrant for her arrest, but as yet the
woman has not been apprehended.
Last night about 7 o'clock Graves
was visiting a penny arcade on Mar
ket street, near Fourth, when he per
ceived the woman he had left, watch
ing him. He saw that she had a re
volver under her coat and tried to
escape through the rear of the arcade.
Finding no exit there he was forced
to go into the street. As soon as he
emerged from the establishment the
woman, he says, made a move as if
to draw the revolver. Graves ran down
the crowded thoroughfare pursued by
the infuriated woman. After three
blocks' hard sprinting, he managed to
elude her.

The Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany'B Acapulco, Captain Russell,
which arrived here May 4, sailed again
yesterday for Panama and way ports.
In spite of her short stay in port the
Acapulco took away a full cargo, and
time was found between her discharg
ing of the" freight she brought, from
the south and the loading of the out
ward bound cargo to drydock the ves
sel and clean and paint her bottom.
Record time was made both in dis
charging and loading, and this in spite
of, the fact that Captain Wilson had
on his hands the burden of loading the
big Mongolia under many difficulties.
The Acapulco carried eighteen cabin
passengers, all but three of whom are
going to New^Ybrk; fifty in the steer
age for New York and seventy Chinese
for South American ports.' The cabin

weather had a strengthening influence. July

CHICAGO. May 9.â With easier cables,
heavy world's shipments and a large Increase
in the amount on passage, thÂ« wheat market
cpened at a decline from Saturday's closing
figures, the July option being down at
S5%'J>>3*4C to Â£5.%c. During the early part
of the session the market was dominated by
the bearish foreign situation, the attention of
pit traders being diverted temporarily trom
the bullish conditions in America. In conse
quence of poor support a further decline in
prices was made. July selling oS to S5%c.
Later in the session crop damage reports and
prospects of a bullish Government report to
morraw started liberal covering by shorts,
Â¦which resulted in a quick rally. A fair cash
demand and the fact that about half the flour
mills in Minneapolis had resumed operations
were an additional stimulant to the Improved
demand. The market continued strong the
remainder of the day, closing prices being near
the top. After selling at eti%'i|i!t>%c July
closed at SÂ»J%c.

August Chamot of 711 Pine street,
the American citizen who was made a
mandarin of China in 1902 at the so
licitation of LI Hung Chang, is the
owner of the famous gold seal offered
to the Selby Smelting and Lead Com
pany for refining/and which was said
to have been one^ of the most ancient
of royal Chinese seals extant.
The seal itself is a work of art from
the Chinese standpoint and carries* on
its face the certification that Li Ching
Wong, a prince of the roya^ family,
had authorized its impression upon any
document to which it might be af
fixed. Prince Li Ching Wong is stilt
in the land of the living and" was one
of the members of the royal family
that took tsides against the reigning
dynasty at the time of the Boxer out
break. Had that movement succeeded
the seal would have been official and
worth more than its bullion weight of
$5000, but as the Ideals of the PrinÂ«'.e
and his party were not reached, the
seal, which had been intended for fu
ture use, had no value except the com
mercial significance of its purity of
gold.
It was placed on the market after
the downfall of the Boxers and sold
to- a French priest, who later sold it
to August Chamot, who brought it to
San Francisco. Though much more
valuable, from a commercial view
point, than any of the jade seals
seized by the Government after the
Peking bout, it is not subject to seiz
ure, as it was simply private property
sold for its weight in gold.
It now occupies a place among the
curios owned by August Chamot.
It was learned that no advantage
would be taken by defendant's counsel
of the clerk's errors.
Adkins made a personal plea for
clemency, which was followed by a
strong plea by Attornel Eddy in his
behalf, who referred to the brutal
character, of the murdered pugilist
and the excellent character of the de
fendant while a soldier in the Philip
pines. The Judge, who had been ex
amining the information, said he had
some doubt about what term to im
pose upon the defendant and would
continue the matter till this morn
ing.
William H. Adkins, colored, ap
peared before Judge Cook yesterday
for, sentence on the charge of man
slaughter for shooting and killing
Muldoon McDonald, a colored pugilist,
on December 25, but through the
carelessness of George Wells, clerk of
the court, In not. filling in the "true
name" of the defendant on the in
formation and omitting to record the
last continuance on the information,
the Judge postponed sentence till to
day.
Errors Committed by Judge Cook's
Clerk Discovered In Time to

â¢ A nattily dressed young man with
Jewel3 on his fingers and giving the
name of S. P. Witzel. called at the
Richelieu Hotel, Van Xess avenue and
Geary street, yesterday morning, rep
resenting himself as a private detec
tive. He produced a badge and said
he had reason to believe that some
one he was searching for was in the
hotel. He was told to leave and did
Â«o reluctantly.
About half a.n hour later A. Abram-
Bon. proprietor of the hotel, had oc
casion to go to his room and was sur
prised to see the alleged private de
tective searching through the drawers
of the bureau. Abramson detained
him and telephoned to police head
quarters. Detective Armstrong hur
ried to the hotel and placed Witzel un
der arrest. A careful search was made
through his clothing and throughout
the hotel for the badge Witzel had
ehown, but it could not be found.
Witzel positively refused to talk and
insised upon the prison officials send
ing for an attorney.

FOUND IN PROPRIETOR'S
ROOM AT THE RICHELIEU
The delay of the Board of Works to
furnish certain information and re
ports was /again made the subject of
criticism before - the Board of Super
visors yesterday. The clerk reported
that no reply had been received from
the boardViamed in regard to a reso
lution sent to It more than a year ago
asking for a plan to make Islals Creek
navigable and to better the harbor
facilities. Supervisor Braunhart said
the matter was important, as many
civic and public "- organizations had
Joined in a proposed movement looking
to the improvement of the creek.
Another' resolution upon which Jhe
Board of Works . has taken no jiction
was that requesting it to report on the
recommendation of the Merchants' As
sociation that the city do its own
street cleaning. Another resolution was
ordered sent to the board again re
questing it to report not later than
next Monday on the matter of street
cleaning so as to guide the Supervisors
In fixing the necessary amount to be
set aside for the purpose. Bids have
b^en invited for the work, but it is
optional with the ' Board of Works
whether a contract shall be awarded
or the work be done by the laborers
employed by the city.
Another resolution not replied to waa
that requesting data on the safety of
theaters, halls and hospitals. As a
report thereon was filed with the Mayor
the board requested .his Honor to fur
nish it with a copy.
The Board of Public Works, through
the City Architect, was requested to
advise as to the proper and safe seat
ing capacity of Woodwards' Pavilion,
Mechanics' Pavilion and the Mechanics'
Pavilion Annex, and also as to the dan
gers arising in these buildings in case
of fire or panic.
Pursuant to the report of Acting
Chief Dougherty, the Fire Commission
yesterday entered a protest with the
Board of Supervisors against the final
passage of the resolution authorizing
the Santa Fe Railway System to close
Eighteenth street from Minnesota to
Iowa street for one year. Dougherty
says that as the work of raisings the
grade of Marittosa street is now in
progress the closing of Eighteenth
street would render it impossible for
engine 16 to reach Southern Heights,
which would thereby be deprived of
its chief protection in case of fire.
Dougherty suggests that the company
agrees to provide a temporary road
for engine 16 along Tennessee street
to Twenty-second, thence to Pennsyl
vania avenue to the corner of Twen
tieth and Texas streets. In that event
the protest will be withdrawn. It was
referred to the Street Committee.
The Yosemite Club was granted a
permit for a professional boxing ex
hibition during June and the Lincoln,
Hayes Valley and Hawthorne clubs
were granted amateur permits for May
12, 17 and 25, respectively.
The amended ordinance fixing the
widths of the sidewalks on Andover
avenue, Ellert, Newman and East Park
streets, Richland and Crescent avenues
was passed to print.
The roadway of Scott street, between
McAllister street and Golden Gate ave
nue, was fully accepted.
The board drew a demand in favor
of the SIme estate for $10,250 for lands
purchased by the city in the condemna
tion proceedings for the acquirement of
St. Mary's Square.
The contract for publishing the law
and motion calendar and the journal
of proceedings of the Board of Super
visors was awarded to the Recorder
Company for $275 a month.
George Ryan was granted a permit
to blast for grading purposes on Army
street near York and his bond was
fixed at $25,000.
The San Francisco Construction
Company was granted a permit to ex
plode blasts in order to break the
bowlders in the sewer trench in Duboce
avenue, between Church and Market
streets, its bond being fixed at $3000.
Maurice Reardon was before the
Finance Committee to explain why he
charged 90 cents each for putting steel
ends on picks belonging to the city,
whereas the price charged for the
picks in open market was only 65 cents
each. Evidence was. adduced that the
former price for the work was $1 a
pick and that they could be purchased
cheaper because they were manufac
tured in large lots. The committee de
cided to hear further evidence next
Wednesday morning before passing
Reardon's demand for $192 50.
George W. Rumble, a mining specu
lator, was placed on trial before a Jury
yesterday in the United States District
Court on a charge of having made use
of the United States postoffice for the
purpose of defrauding his correspond
ents by means of worthless mining
schemes and by false representations.
The testimony of one of the alleged
victims, John Bull Jr. of Elmira, New
York, was taken and the court ad
journed until 11 a. m. to-day.
The Indictment accuses Rumble of
having corresponded through the post
office with Frank Terry. Dlx TV. Smith
and John Bull Jr.. representing to them
that he was the owner, secretary and
general manager of the Sunset Mining
Company, capitalized at $10,000,000. the
Etock being divided Into shares at $1
each. There wpre alleged to be twelve
g-old mines under his control, namely,
the Old Glory, the Amo Mine, the Amo
Hydraulic Mine and others In Butte,
Shasta and Siskiyou counties, and that
the Sunset .Mining Companyis stock
was paying dividends at the rate of
2 per cent a month and had been pay-
Ing at that rate for the last nine years.
Rumble represented also that some of
the ore assayed from $500 to $800 a ton,
that from the Old Glory in one year
had been taken $72,S12 and that a sur
plus of $25,531 had been found after
paying the 2 per cent dividends and
ell expenses.
The trial is being closely watched by
James O'Connell, Postorflce Inspector,
Â¦who has spent several months In secur
ing evidence against the defendant.
Former State Attorney General W. H.
H. Hart is leading counsel for the de
fense. The Government is represented
by United States District Attorney
Marshall B. Woodworth and Assistant
United States District Attorney Ben
L. McKinley.
The Richmond association also peti
tioned that the control of the city cem
etery be placed In the hands of the
Park Commission in order that; as has
been suggested by Commissioner
Frank Sullivan, proper respect may be
shown the dead by saving the place
from the disgraceful rum into which
it is falling. The association also asks
the board to investigate the proposed
work in the district in order that as
sessment districts may be created to
pay for street work where the street is
of unusual width.
The present dusty cars, stuffy. 111 yentllated
and unwashed, especially the electria cars.
and. except a few new ones, without paint or
varnish operated on all the lines except Cali
fornia street, are a disgrace and a shame to
our city. No protests of citizens can cor
rect these evils as long as our municipal
transportation is In private hands.
The receipts of the company have Increased
from $5,125,882 in 1901 to I6.243.21S during
1003. an increase of $1,117,336 in two years.
and they are still Increasing at the same
ratio. The people of San Francisco are pay-
Ing to this company alone about $18 per capita
per annum, the highest street railway re
ceipts of any city and more than double the
per capita receipts of 05 per cent of tho
cities of the United States. We are yet pay
ing five cents for a ride, although thirty years
ago our Keamy street horse cars sold six
tickets for twenty-five cents and the* cost of
operation per car mile of an electrlo car is
nearly half that of a horse car.
* CARS ARE DUSTY.
- The company operating our lines 'openly
violates the provision of many of its fran
chises that requires that, all the material
used In the operation of its lines shall bÂ«
of local manufacture. The cars, wheels, cross
ings, switches, even the boilers for power are
made in the East, and our local manufacturers
are deprived of this work that was formerly
done here, and hundredsc of men thrown out
of employment.'
The franchises require that the portion of
the street between 'the tracks and two feet
outside shall be kept in repair by the company.
It, is ; not properly taken care of and the
roadway almost throughout the city Is In a
disgraceful and in many places a dangerous
condition.
The Richmond Improvement Associa

propriate a sufficient sum In the forth
coming budget for the construction of
a municipal electric railway upon the
route of the present Geary street line

Miss Smith claims that Leopold had
learned hypnotism ' from Althotus, the
last of the Greeks that taught it, and
asserts that she is in communication
with Leopold.-
Dr. Tun disowned belief in spiritual-
Ism.
Miss Smith, said Dr. Tull, claims in
timate communication with Leopold,. a
citizen ~~of Mars, who. she holds, was
none other than Cagllostro, who taught
hypnotism to the eminent Dr. Mesmer
of Paris. Dr. Mesmer later gave to the
world his method of mesmerism. ,'
3IISS SMITH'S CLAIMS.
Dr. W. J. Tull gave some instances
which; would strengthen - the foundar
tion upon .which. the Rev. Mr. McKl
hinney raised his theory. In doing so
Dr. Tull mentioned a Miss Helene
Smith, a clerk in a store in Geneva,
Switzerland, a girl with no affiliation
with psychic research or Investigators,
that had amazed those that had learn
ed of her powers.
Andrew Lang gives an instance of a young
man who sees a phantasm of his dead sister
with a long scratch upon her face. His
mother tells him that she had accidentally
scratched the cheek of the corpse as sho
arranged the flowers in the coffin and that
she concealed It by the aid of powder.
â¢ Was this the communication of a spirit or
was it a communication from the mother
through thought-transference? If we may
accept Andrew Lang as a conservative reviewer
of more than twenty years' labor, we shall
reach this conclusion that there is something
In the constitution ot man which science has
not yet explained.
From investigation by the best minds in
England and America comes the conclusion
that there is a subconscious mind in every
individual and that some persons have ac
cess to the subconscious mind in thamselves
and In others. ' # '
Pome there are who show that' they hav
access - to the subconscious mind in a trance
state, others in a hypnotic state, others in a
somnambulistic state, others in a dying state;
others In times of great danger from drown
ing or from fire; others in a dream state,
where they get communications from relatives,
who, though thousands of miles away, reveal
their nearness to deatb.
It is pretty well established thatthera is
a subconscious or subllmnal mind. Sir "Wil
liam Hamilton In his lectures . on metaphysics
called this the latent .memory or mind and
substantiated his claim to Its existence by
the case of a woman In the delirium of | fever
uttering Hebrew phrases which she in normal
condition knew nothing about. It was ascer
tained that some twenty years previous, 'when
the woman was a child, she had been. In
the company of a clergyman who was in the
habit of committing >and repeating aloud pas
sages of the Hebrew Scriptures.
The people are seeing visions and Â¦ getting
communications and men of more pretentious
learning have been compelled to give heed to
these thtnzs.
"Psychical Research" was the title of
an address by the Rev. J. M. McElhln
ney before the members of the Presby
terian Ministers' Association at Pres
byterian House, yesterday morning.
The' Rev. Dr. J. S. Thomas. presided."
The speaker said in part:
In that emergency the crew was wholly
lnrfflcient and Incompetent, as the sad results
proved. The boats were In separate places on
the ship: the sailors could not understand the
language in which the orders of the officers In
command of the respective boats had to bÂ»
given; it waa too dark for them to see signs
(if sign* could have bten intelligently given)
and only one of the two Chinese who spoke
Engllfh appears to have known anything about
the lowering of boats, and there had been
no drill of the crew In the manner of lowering
tfceni. Under such circumstances It Is â¢ not
surprising that but three of the boat* were
lowered, one of which waa successfully
launched by the efforts of Officer Coghlan and
the ship's carpenter, another of which was
swamped by one of the Chinese crew letting
the after fall down with a run and the third
of which was lowered so slowly that It was
ewamped as the ship went down. We. have
no hesitation In holding that the ship was
Insufficiently manned, for the reason that the
tailors - were unable to understand and exe
cute the orders made Imperative by the ex
lcency that unhappily arose and resulted bo
disastrously td life as well as to property.
It results from what has been said that the
court ' below aleo erred In denying Ap
pellant Clara Berwick's claim, mad* on her
own behalf and that of her minor children,
for damages tor the death of her husband,
on the ground that he was a fellow servant of
th* master and pilot ef the shin.
The action of the court in respect to the
claim of Ruth Miller, executrix of the estate
of Barah Wakefle!d, deceased, was, in our
opinion, correct.
The Judgment is reversed and the cause re
manded with directions to the court below
to enter" Judgment against the petitioner deny
ing Its application for a limitation of liability
and in favor of the respective claimants for
the full amount of damage* It has heretofore
awarded them, with interest and costs, and
In favor of the claimant, Clara Barwick, tot
such amount of damages as the court shall
find from the evidence already taken or thai
may be taken she 'is entitled to by reason of
the death of her husband. ' and by reason of
the loss of his personal effects, and against
the claim of Ruth Miller as executrix of the
estate of Sarah Wakeflcld. deceased.
After quoting several other author
ities on this point the decision goes
on to say:
The case shown that the City of Rio de
Janeiro left the port of Honolulu on the
voyage undÂ»r consideration with a crew of
eighty-four Chinamen, officered by white men.
The officers could not speak the language of
the Chinese and but two of the latter â the
boatswain and chief fireman â could under
stand that of the officers. ConsÂ«Hiuently the
orders of the officers had to be communicated
either through the boatswain or chief fireman,
or by rlg-ns and signals. So far as appearb
that seemed to have worked well enough on
the voyage In question until the ship came to
grief and there arose the necessity for quick
and energetic action in the darkness.
DRILL NEGLECTED.
The decision quotes an opinion by
Judge Hawley in re Meyer, 74 Fed.
Rep., S85, in which the law is laid
down that it is the duty of the own
ers of a steamer carrying goods and
passengers to provide the vessel with
officers and crew adequate in num
ber and competent for their duty with
reference to all the exigencies of the
intended route; not merely competent
for ordinary duties of an uneventful
voyage, but for any exigency that is
likely to happen, such as in the case of
the Rio.
â¢ ' â¢ â¢ But how about Chinese sailors or
Bailors- of any other class or. race, who cannot
understand the orders that become necessary
In the course of their duties because of a lack
of knowledge of the language in which they
have to- be given? That's the question we
hav e to consider and determine here.
The evidence 1b that under euch condition*
five minutes wÂ«Â« ample time for the lowerlne
of the boats. It further *0u>ws that there was
no Hpanic among the passengers or crew, that
the passengers behaved well, and that the cap
tain immediately upon the ship's striking the
rocks sounded the alarm and called the crew
to the boats. Each of the boats was com
manded by a white officer and manned by a
part of the Chinese crew. Yet but three of the
elevrti boats were lowered Into the water, one
of which, the aft-quarter boat No. 10, was
lowered by Officer Coghlan -and the ship's car
penter, and but three of the hundred and odd
passengers that the ship carried were taken
into any boat. There must, in the very nature
of things, have been 6ome paramount, control
ling cauee for all this. And that cause, we
think. Is very easily to beeeen. It was not
nitrely for the reason that the men depended
upon to man the boats were Chinese. To the
contrary the evidence is that the Chinese make
excellent sailors.
MUST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.
The Rio, while attempting, on Febru
ary 22, 1901. to enter the harbor of San
Francisco in a dense fogr at half past
5 o"clock in the morning, struck upon a
sunken rock or reef outside the 1 Golden
Gate and sank within twenty minutes,
drowning about 200 persons, mostly
Chinese.
The following extracts ; are from
Judge Ross' decision:
AMPLE TIME FOR BOATS.
The decision of the court of appeals
is based upon the proposition that all
of the CWnese crew of the Rio could
not speak or understand English and
that the crew, therefore, was Inade
quate for the exigency that arose.
Hence the company was held respon
sible for the loss of life that followed
upon the incapacity of the crew to
launch the life boats properly.
In the District Court the successful
claimants recovered damages to the
amount of $35,125, which was to be paid
pro rata with $24,977 93. the sum to
which the court had limited the liabil
ity.
By a decision of the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals handed down
yesterday by United States Circuit
Judge Erskine M. Roes- and concurred
In by his associates, Morrow, Gilbert
and Hawley, the responsibility for the
loss of life In the wreck of the steam
ship.Clty of Rio de Janeiro was placed
upon the shoulders of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company. The .decision of
United States District Judge John J.
de Haven that the liability of the com
pany should be limited to $24,977 93 was
reversed. His decision also that Clara
Barwick was not entitled to any dam
ages for the death of her Husband, the
ship's butcher, on the ground that he
was a fellow servant, was also reversed
and the lower court was instructed to
give her whatever damages the testi
mony already taken or to be taken
might show her to be entitled to.
Judge de Haven's action in denying
the claim of Ruth Miller, as executrix
of the estate of Sarah Wakefield, was
sustained.
