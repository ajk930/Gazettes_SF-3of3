The San Francisco Call
Alexieff Is Alleged to Have
Shot Officer Responsi
ble for Defeat
Special Dispatch to T*e Call.
LONDON*, Feb. 17.â The St. Peters
burg correspondent of the Express
telegraphs that he learns from official
sources of a dramatic sequel to the
Russian disaster at Port Arthur on
February 9. After. the attack by the
Japanese Viceroy Alexieff summoned
before him the Russian officers whose
negligence was the main cause of the
defeat. After examining them as to
their conduct Alexieff was convinced
that a lieutenant among them was most
culpably guilty.' It is declared Alexieff
drew a revolver and shot the young
officer dead before his comrades. The
lieutenant had taken a party of officers
ashore on a torpedo boat, whereas he
should have been on guard outside the
harbor.
ST. PETERSBURG/Feb. 17.â A dis
patch has been received from Major
General Pflug. chief of staff to Viceroy
Alexieff, saying that Yuan Shi Kai,
commander in chief of the Chinese
army and navy, has ordered 2500 men
to Tsichou to maintain order.
Continuing he says everything is
quiet at Newchwang and the informa
tion that the Japanese are forming
bands of chunchus (bandits) to attack
the railroad Is confirmed.
Quiet prevails on the Yalu. Russian
scouts did not find the enemy within a
distance of forty- three miles from the
river.
STORM BUFFETS WARSHIPS.
A Government communication pub
lished in the Official Messenger warns
the public that it must wait patiently
for news of Russian victories and says
it is useless to waste men in securing
an over- hasty revenge.
Viceroy Alexieff .has communicated
to the Czar the report that Captain
Reitzenstein, who Is in command of
the Russian cruiser division, dealing
with the destruetlon of the Japanese
merchant steamer Nakamura Maru off
the northwestern coast of Japan and
the capture of forty-one of her crew.
The captain, who also Is acting .'com
modore of the Vladivostok squadron,
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1904.
says that a small Japanese coaster
also was approached, but the violent
squall made it impossible to capture
the crew and that therefore the coaster
was not sunk.
Heavy weather, he says, prevented
him following the coaster, and the
cruiser squadron made for Chestakoff,
fleeing before the tempest to gain the
Korean coast. Owing to the storm, the
squadron was able to accomplish only
five knots per hour. Heavy seas were
shipped and the cruisers and guns were
coated with ice, there being nine de
grees of frost. Two violent gales were
encountered within three days.
CZAR'S FAREWELL TO TROOPS.
In the courtyard of the Winter Pal
ace the Czar to-day reviewed the Third
battalion of the First Siberian Rifles,
which is proceding to the Far East. The
review took place in the presence of
the Czarina, the Dowager Empress.
Grand Duke Michael, War Minister Ku
ropatkln, General Sakharoff, chief of
staff, and a number of court officials.
After the inspection, the rendering of
the national anthem by the band and
cheers from the spectators, the Czar
made a speech to the departing soldiers,
in which he said:
"My brothers, I am happy to see you
all before you leave, and I wish you a
good Journey. I am firmly convinced
that you all will uphold the honor of
your ancient regiment and readily risk
your lives for your dear fatherland.
"Remember^ your foe is brave, con
fident and crafty. From my heart I
wish you success over your opponents.
I bless you, my brothers, and with you
the Famous Siberian regiment. May
Seraphim pray for you and accompany
you In all your ways.
'"I thank the officers for volunteering
their, services and once more I thank
you all, by brothers, with all my heart.
God bless you." [ .:
The battalion, accompanied .by â Its
baggage wagons, then marched
the Czar calling out to the' men as they
went by: "Good by, my brothers."

Commander Tokenouchi did not know the name of the vessel struck by a torpedo
discharged by the Heyatory, but the Navy Department has since learned from
other sources that it was the Boyarin.
A dispatch from St. Petersburg, dated February 16, stated that the Boyarin
was blown up with a loss of 197 officers and men on February 13 by a mine

successes through hard fighting. What

ADDRESSES
HIS PARTY
Urges Rank and File
oi the Democracy
to Unite.
Believes There Is Chance
oi Winning Presiden
tial Election.
Says Obsolete Issues No Longer Chal
lenging Popular Interest Should
. Be Manfully Abandoned.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 17. â In an
article written for -this week's Satur
day Evening Post, former President
Cleveland urges his "rank and. file as
sociates" of the Democratic party to
unite and take a'dvantage of the op
portunities of next November.
"I am one of those," he writes, "who
believes that there is an opportunity
for Democratic success in the coming
Presidential election.
"Though attachment to the party in
which I am enlisted and an intense
desire for its ascendency make such a
belief exceedingly welcome, they cer
tainly do not create it. It is built up
on an unshaken and abiding trust in
the patriotism and intelligence of my
fellow countrymen."
Mr. Cleveland's paper opens with a
reiteration of the declaration that he
made three years ago, that "our fight
ing forces will respond listlessly and
falteringly if summoned to a third de
feat in a strange cause, but if they
hear the rallying cry of true Dem
ocracy they will gather for battle with
old-time Democratic enthusiasm and
courage."
FAITH IX ASSOCIATES.
Referring to his faith in his Demo
cratic associates, he continues:
"This trust will not permit me to
overlook the meaning of the daily in
creasing unrest among our people
growing out of the startling and flip
pant abandonment by the party in
power of our national traditions and
maxims, its disregard of our national
moral restraint, the inconsiderate ten
dency to set aside national good faith.
Its willingness to break away from
safe and accustomed moorings and it3
contemptuous neglect of our nationrU
mission. Surely these conditions, to
gether with the broken pledges anil
forgotten promises of reforms that vex
the sight on every side, not only
abundantly explain the popular dis
trust and fear, prevailing everywhere
In the land, but suggest that in such
stress of political weather, those of
our fellow citizens who thoughtfully
and constantly love our free institu
tions will not be unmindful of such
safety and quiet as may be offered
them by a patriotic and conservative
Democracy."
DEMOCRACY'S OPPORTUNITY.
. Mr. Cleveland thinks these condi
tions Justify the assertion of Dem
ocracy's opportunity. He says:
"It should be remembered, however,
that opportunity may be only distantly
related to actual accomplishment and
that it does not of itself unaided and
alone warrant the expectation of
reaching successful results.
"This Is no time for cunning finesse,
nor for the use of words that conceal
intentions or carry a doubtful mean-
Ing. >
"The Democratic party has a mes
sage to send to its followers and to the
masses of the American people. "Let
that message be expressed in language
easily understood, unconfused by the
vision and untouched by the taint of
Jugglery. Obsolete issues and ques
tions no longer challenging popular
interest should be manfully aban
doned." -
URGES TARIFF REFORM.
Mr. Cleveland urges tariff reforms,
pleads for reduced expenditure of pub
lic money and charges the opposition
with having made promises and broken
them. He arraigns the administration's
Philippine policy, and refers to tha

of the express car. The engine tipped

bumps and they probably would have
been thrown on their sides. The
ties and rails of the tracks on either

There were many people watching
the approach of the train and they are
almost unanimous in saying that tho

Engineer Lightner says he had just
whistled for the semaphore and was
running not faster tnan twenty-five

The passenger coaches were brought

MEMORY OF SENATOR HANNA
Services in Consonance With the Character of the Dead States
man Are Held in the Senate Chamber in the Presence of the
"Sorrowing Relatives l and a Host . of Grief-Stricken Friends
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. â In the
presence of the grief-stricken family,
of. ., many friends whose sorrow was
scarcely less pronounced, of the Senate
and. House of Representatives, of the
dignitaries from all the other branches
of and of the chief
official representatives of most of the
" TcrrTlffn powersrthe funeral of the late
Senator Marcus A. Hanna occurred Vo
j day hi' the' t^Snate 'chamber, the scene
j of. hjs most recent activities and of his
j entire official life, Tho spectacle was
I imposiiig and quite .in, harmony with
the public estimate of the great man's
services to his country and the world.
The ceremony was, dignified and
simple, 'in consonance wifh his char
acter, and the Senate chamber lent it
self ,naturall>;~to-.the .occasion. It is
.especially barren of decorations, and
the dark "furniture, heavy walls and
j light - >vere : quite ; in keeping
.with the sorrowfuj, proceedings which
were j the -occasion at the gathering.
Seldom has a- more distinguished body
of people been collected in Washing
! ton to dohoh'6f,~eTTher to the living or
the dead, and rarely has there been
witnessed a-TfiOre impressive proceed
ing. , . '
Without pomp or ceremony the re
! mains were conveyed from the Arling
[ ton Hotel to the Senate chamber. The
pallbearers were composed of a de
tachment of Capitol police, under the
command of a lieutenant, and the cor
tege was preceded by a platoon of
mounted city police.
FIA)\VERS ENVELOP CASKET.
Throughout the forenoon a number
of frh-nds called at the hotel and were
permitted to view the remains. The
room in which the dead statesman lay
was so banked with floral tributes as
to almost hide tho casket. Upon .the
lapel of the late Senator's coat; was
the insignia of the Loyal Le"gion and
the casket was enveloped in' a huge
American flag belonging to that or
ganization.' â¢â¢
Before the casket was sealed the
members of the family, with the ex
ception of Mrs. Hanna, took a^ last
look at the remains.
Not since the Senator passed away
has Mrs. Hanna seen, the remains, pre
ferring to remember her husband as
in life.
In the front rank of the eminent as
semblage gathered immediately about
the bier of the departed statesman in
the Senate chamber sat President
Roosevelt. He was- flanked by the mem
bers of his Cabinet, all of whom had
been closely affiliated with Senator
Harma by ties of friendship and posi
tion." Near by were the Chief Justice
and Associate Justices of the Supreme
Court of the United States, garbed in
their black robefe.of office,, which fitted
well into the scene of sorrow. 'There
were scarcely any absentees from

sense of personal loss that all felt in
Hanna's death.
The desk of their late colleague was
heavily draped.
ARRIVAL OP THE FAMILY.
The religious ceremony was fittingly
placed in the hands of Dr. Everett Hale,
chaplain of the Senate, giving it an
official character, while preserving its
solemnity and insuring its simple dig
nity.
No order of any kind was maintained
at the Capitol in the arrival of partici
pants in the services. The President
reached the east portico of the Senate
wing at .11:55 a. m., accompanied by
Mr. Loeb, his secretary. They pro
ceeded at once to .the President's roÂ«m,
where they were joined by Cabinet
members. The President's family came
soon afterward and were assigned to
seats in the members' gallery, where
they were joined by Secretary Loeb
after the President and Cabinet had !
entered^ the Senate chamber. Members
of the diplomatic corps came individ
ually and assembled in the Senate re
ception-room. It was just noon when
the members of Senator Hanna's fam
ily arrived, airs. Hanna came on the
arm of her son, Daniel R. Hanna, and I
Mrs. Daniel R. Hanna on the arm of j
H. M. Hanna. They were followed by
Mr. and Mrs. McCormick and Mr. and
Mrs. Parsons, Miss Phelps and personal
friends of the family.
MANY FLORAL TRIBUTES.
The ceremony began shortly after 12
o'clock, but the gallery doors were
thrown open long before that hour and
by 11 o'clock fully half the gallery seats
were occupied, mostly by ladies. The
casket was borne into .the chamber by
a squad of Capitol police, headed by
Sergeant-at-Arms Randell of the Sen
ate, and was immediately followed by
the official committee, with Senator
Foraker and General Grosvenor at
its head. Slowly the. little procession
moved down the main aisle of the
chamber and the casket was tenderly
placed upon the catafalque.
The hall was banked with flowers
which had been sent in great profusion
by friends. There was a large wreath
of orchids surrounding a cross of vio
lets from the President.
The Senate contributed an immense
wreath of orchids, carnations, roses
and violets, the Republican Association
of Ohio another almost as large, and
the Gridiron Club of this city another,
which was of striking beauty.
Senator Frye, as President pro tem
pore, stood in front of his chair as the
body was borne to Its resting place.
All the people in the galleries rose as
if with one impulse as the casket was
borne to its place. The pall bearers
had scarcely retired, when the Senate
was called to order and. the Senators
whg had entered took their seats upon
the fall of the gavel -of the President
pro tern. . Immediately afterward the
House of Representatives, with Speaker
Cannon at its head, was announced,
and the members of that body filed
slowly in, taking the seats previously
assigned to them, the Senators and vis
itors in the galleries rising.
OFFICIALS IX ATTENDANCE.
Speaker Cannon took his place at the

preme Court were ushered into seats
on the Democratic side.
President Roosevelt and members of
his Cabinet were then announced and
all present arose without waiting for
the tap of the gavel. The Presidential
party were escorted by Colonel Symons
and Commander Winslow in full uni
form. The President and his Cabinet
occupied the front row of seats at the
right of the presiding officer.
Twenty minutes later, Mrs. Hanna,
leaning upon the arm of her son, Dan
R. Hanna, entered the chamber and
took a seat in the front row on the left
of the presiding officer. She was fol
lowed by her daughters and their hus
bands and other members of the fam
ily and immediate friends, all of whom
were given seats in the immediate vi
cinity of the casket. Every one pres
ent rose as the family entered and re
mained standing until they had been
eeated. President .Pro Tern. Frye then
addressed the Senate, saying:
â¢ Senators: You have solemnly and lovingly
dedicated this day to an observance of a proper
funeral ceremony over Marcus A. Hanna, late a
distinguished member of this body, and all
business will be suspended to that end.
We will unite In prayer with the chaplain
of the National House of Representatives.
TRIBUTE TO THE DEAD.
Chaplain Couder, who occupied a
seat by the side of Chaplain Hale of
the Senate, immediately in front of the
presiding officer, offered up an Invoca
tion.
Immediately after Dr. Hale deliver
ed his funeral address. He did not
use his notes in speaking, but never
halted for a word, and, although
more than 80 years old, his voice pene
trated every corner of the hall. He
epoke in part as follows:
Those who knew him best loved him most.
And those who knew him little loved him
much.
You speak of no one else as you go and come
In these days: and this is the Impression which
is made, say on a man like me â almost a
stranger to him personally. I knew him very
little, but I have felt his power and charm.
There are a hundred men who are hearing me
better fitted than 1 am to describe him or to
account for. hi* power, but I think they would
all have to recognize the promptness, the ln
tcnutty of thought and action which comes
when a man's heart is engaged â the energy
and success of a man who does what he loves
to do, what he wants to do. what he ought to
do because he loves it, "because he believes in
It. because he lives not for himself, but for
those whom he so gladly serves. -
I was talking once with a distinguished miÂ«
slcnary who had spent his life In. one of those
philosophical J countries whose religion came
more or less Into fashion among us half a
century ago. and he. said to me that the peo
ple among whom he had lived loved the lord
their God with all their heart and with all
thfllr mind, but they did not love him with all
their strength. Our friend loved with all hlÂ«
might. He found out what was to bo done
and he did it.
That class of people, which is too large,
who make it their profession to ascribe the
worst conceivable motives for every human
action could not make Mr. Hanna out when
he appeared in what is called public life.
They made th? mistake which such men always
make â of thinking that the mind, with all its
maneuvers and gymnastics and memories and
Imagination, is greater and stronger than tho
poul of man while it works In sincerity and
truth in faith and hope and love. '
They had tp Imagine, therefore, a cunnlnx
latrlcuer. a man who accounted for his sue-
ceÂ«Â« m you might account for a boy's isuccess
In a. game of marbles. But the analysis of
character did not prove true. You might aa
well compare the stilted adjectives and sub
stantives, of a schoolboy's theme against
the passionate song of Burns or of Tennyson.
Here was no contriver no schemer, no mere
inventor, least of all was he a copyist. Here
was a whole-souled child of God who believed
in succesa and who knew how to succeed by
using the Infinite powers. I
Eight years ago an accomplished friend of
mine said to one of the speakers in the can
vass: "Who is this Cleveland man. this
Hanna. whom the newspapers are describing?"
The answer stays by me. I wonder if the
man himself remembers it: "Hanna is a man
who means to apply to politics the methods of
business men of honor."
Honor, truth and love! Go to the bottom
and these are what win success. A square
bolt will not fit a round hole in the side of a
steamship. Truth â unless my word Is as good
as my note my note will be looked at coldly
when I offer it for discount. And unless I
pursue the duty God i has given me with an
eager love of those who have fallen down or
those who have stumbled; â  unless in my
strength I bear the infirmities of the weak,
ah. woe is me! IÂ»ve!
And so when men tell us what is true, that
this man more than any other could mediate
between the men who provide the tools and
j the men who handle them, that thl3 man had
the confidence of the workman and of the man
whose father was a workman, or the man
who. like himself, had made nature his star
and ruled things with what is godly power,
you understand what worked the miracle. You
can work It yourself. â¢ .
These three abide: Faith, hope and' love.
SPECTATORS ARE AFFECTED.
i After a prayer, with which Dr. Hale
J closed his sermon, the Gridiron Quar
' tet sang "Nearer, My God, to Thee."
While the religious services were In
progress suppressed sobs were heard
in many parts of the chamber. Post
master General Payne, who had been
for years associated with Mr. Hanna
on the national committee, was among
those most affected. Secretary Hitch
cock was also visibly touched. .
The hymn concluded, President Pro
Tern. Frye addressed the assembly,
saying:
We commit the body of our beloved Senator
now to the committees, to the houses of Con
gress and to the of fleers of the Senate to bo
conveyed to his late home in Ohio and to Us
final resting place
May God sanctify his life and death to us
who loved him well.
.The services were then closed with
a benediction by Dr. Hale.
The visitors and family then-'with
drew, the family followed by the Presi
dent and Cabinet.
The Senate then at 1 o'clock, on mo
tion of Senator Lodge, adjourned.
NOTABLE CITIZENS PRESENT.
Among the' distinguished men from
New York who attended the funeral
services at the -Senate ' were Former
Secretary of the Interior Cornelius N.
Bliss, General John J. McCook, presi
dent of the Ohio Society; J. Plerpont
Morgan, James J. Hill and Clement A.
Griscom, president of the International
Navigation Company.
Many persons who had occupied the
galleries during the service left the
Capitol building with apparent reluct
ance. It was not generally known that
the remains were not to lie in state,
and, as soon as the people were dis
missed a crush occurred around, the
Senate chamber "doors by reason of the
large number seeking admission to
gaze for the last time on a face known
widely and loved by all. The order to'
clear the galleries was given, however,
and within an hour the chamber and
galleries had been closed against the
public. The remains were left at rest
in the closed chamber, surrounded by
the floral offerings and under a guard
of Capitol police.

1RMT ABUSES
LENIENT ORDER
Roosevelt Revokes McKinley's
Order Allowing Troopers to
Bring In Goods Duty Free
VOLUNTEERS MISUSE LAW
Flagrant Violation of Late
President's Fiat Cause of
Revocation by His Successor
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â The Presi
dent to-day issued an executive order
revoking the order of President McKln
ley allowing gifts from officers of the
army and navy and the civic service in
Porto Rico and Cuba, the Philippines,
etc., to be admitted into the United
States free of duty.
It is understood that the privileges
granted by President McKinley's order
have been greatly abused of late and
that the real purpose of the orders,
which was to allow the volunteer sol
diers, sailors and others in the Gov
ernment service in Cuba, China and
our island possessions to send presents
to the members of their immediate
families at Christmas time free of duty,
has been lost sight of and that large
quantities of goods of every description
are constantly bein|f forwarded to this
country in flagrant violation of the let
ter and spirit of President McKlnley'a
order. This is said to be the cause of
their revocation.
close at noon on the day of the funeral.
In accordance with* the wishes of the
Hanna family it has been decided that
no remarks of an eulogistic nature
shall be made in St. Paul's Church at
the funeral services over the remains
of Senator Hanna, which will be held
Friday, and the services will consist
only of the ritualistic services of the
EpiBcopal Church.
A memorial meeting, however, will be
held at the Chamber of Commerce Sat
urday afternoon, when prominent citi
zens will deliver addresses on the life
and work of the deceased statesman.
The attendance of notable men at the
funeral promises to be large. Besides
Senator Foraker, three Secretaries of
the President's Cabinet, Messrs. Taft,
Wilson and Cortelyou, and the delega
tion from the Senate and the House
of Representatives there will be in at
tendance the entire Ohio State Lewis
lature, which will come from "Colum
bus on a special train. Governor
Herrick and staff and ex-Governor
Nash and tea friends will also attend
So far as known Governor Durbin of
Indiana is the only State Executive
outside of Ohio coming to the funeral.
Governor .Durbin will be accompanied
by his stan!.
Hanna's pictures are in every store
window in the city, surrounded either,
by simple draperies, an American flag
or some handsome and appropriate
floral design.
It _ was decided to-night by the local
committee of arrangements for the
lying In state ceremonies to open the
auditorium of the Chamber of Com
merce at 6 o'clock Friday morning In
stead of 8 o'clock, for the convenience
of hundreds of worklngmen.
At the meeting of the United Trades
and Labor Council to-night twenty rep
resentatives were chosen from the vari
ous crafts to participate in the Hanna
funeral. The proposed general outpour
ing of wcrkingmen has been abandoned
at the wishes of the immediate family
of the Senator.
The Governor telegraphed instruc
tions for the issuance of a supplement
ary proclamation requesting that as a
further mark of respect to the memory
of the late Senator all business in the
State be suspended for five minutes,
from 1 to 1:05 p. m. Friday, during
the funeral service at Cleveland.
The joint resolution drawn up by the
committee of State officers and mem
bers of the Legislature, the following
tribute to the late Senator was issued:
Three times In the space of five weeks Ohio
has been shocked and grieved by the death
of a distinguished citizen whose leadership
among his fellows had trained for him the
highest popular favor. Two of these have
filled the Governor's chair with conspicuous
ability; the third, as chief of his party or
ganization, as Senator in the National Con
gress, as broad-minded statesman and philan
thropic citizen, waa one of the most influen
tial men of his time. 'Emerging from private
life less than a decade ago and from the be
ginning much misunderstood and most abused,
not to say cordially hated by those who did
not know him. in a few fleeting years he had
compelled the admiration of all and had won
the trust and love of both. Marcus A. Hanna
was a masterful man. but he was also a man
of high and honorable purposes and of genial
disposition. He went straight to the mark,
but there was nothing sinister In his methods.
He was always out in the open, honest, zeal
ous, frank and fair. With arueh methods ho
won success and successfully earned the re
markable Indorsement which called out that
proud and happy utterance which Is still ring-
Ing In our ears. "We shall miss his wise coun
sel, his Intrepid leadership, his loyal friend
ship." /
Kentucky rays Tribute of Respect.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 17. â In
the Senate to-day resolutions paying
tribute to . the memory of Senator
Hanna were adopted by a rising vote
and the Senate adjourned as a fur
ther mark of respect.
DICK MAY BE CHOSEN.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. Feb. 17. â There
is a growing feeling here that the
question of a successor to Senator
Hanna will not precipitate such a
fight as was expected. It is now be
lieved that when the time for the bal
loting arrives Congressman Charles
Dick will prove to be the man.
The Republicans are expected to
"caucus a week from the coming Satur
day night and it is believed they will
decide to elect a Senator for both the
long and the short terms, â¢ despite the
fact that their right to elect for the
long term at his ime is questioned.
. / A leader high^ in the Republican
party to-day told* an interesting story
which makes it reasonable to believe
that Dick will be chosen as Senator.
The story as told conforms to cer
tain known facts. The gentleman
said that a week before the last Re
publican State convention was held In
Columbus , a conference occurred at a
residence in Akron between Hanna,
Herrick and. Dick. I Senator Hanna at
the time had misgivings as to the time
he had to live and said Herrick and
Dick that he consid-ered them as his
boys and expected them to take up his

work, which they both knew. With
respect to Herrick it is said that Han
na was following out McKinley's
wishes in taking care of the present
Governor. There was a demand for
recognition for Warren B. Harding
that was too strong to be overlooked
and it was agreed in the conference
that Herrick should be the nominee
for Governor, with Harding for secoivl
place. There was also a, distinct un
derstanding that Herrick should not
voluntarily relinquish the Governor's
chair, as' that would throw the office
into the hands of the Foraker ele
ment of the party by making Harding
Governor. There were certain agree
ments to be carried out, and a change
in the Governor's office would
violate these promises, Hanna
was anxious to carry Cuyahoga Coun
ty and by making the concession to
his opponents in Harding's nomina
tion he believed that he would be able
to do so. For this reason it is be
lieved that Governor Herrick cannot
entertain for an instant the idea of
going to the Senate and the Hanna
followers, including Herrick himself,
must support . Dick for the Senator
ship. While many names are being
mentioned, all are mere speculations
and those who give the situation seri
ous consideration are growing firmer
in the belief that Dick was the man.

"The Democratic party has been con
sistent and unremitting in its advocacy
of an interoceanic canal and has with
the liveliest satisfaction looked forward
to the day when such a highway of
commerce, built under the auspices of
our Government, would be contributed
by America to the world's progress and
civilization. It is, nevertheless, not
within the mandate of the Democratic
creed that in consummating so noble
an enterprise as this the territorial
rights of any other nation should be
disregarded or that our own national

MARTSVILLE. Feb. 17.â Henry Berg
Jr. and Miss Gertrude Gray, prominent
young society people of th'.s city nar
rowly .escaped death in the flood waters
of the Feather River last night. Their
escape was a miraculous one, and was
due principally to the heroic efforts of
Berg.
The young couple was returning from
a party in Yuba City, Sutter County,
about a half-mile from here when
they found that the flood water of
the river was running swiftly over the
grade. They did not consider the
river dangerous and started to cross
over. When about half-way over the
current washed the horse from its feet
and carried the buggy and the floun
dering animal over the grade into wa
ter about eight feet deep. The buggy
was overturned and the occupants
thrown into the swift and muddy tor
rent. Berg then gave up Idea of sav
ing the horse and turned his attention
to the young lady, who was caught In
the buggy. He succeeded in swimming
into shallow water and saving the life
of his companion and reaching the
bridge, where assistance was procured.
Both young people reached their
homes in this city about 1 o'clock this
morning and consider that their escape
from death was indeed most fortunate.
The young lady was In an exhausted
condition, but this evening reports no
111 effects from her sudden and ex
tremely cold bath. The horse was
found dead this morning several hun
dred yards below the scene of the acci
dent. It had lodged in some brush. The
buggy has not as yet been located, as
the water is still rising and is very
deep where the young people went over
the grade.
GAME OF POKER COSTS

Evening at Club and Sporting
Man Wins His Money.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 17.â O. A. Lov
dal, a well-known and wealthy hop
grower of Sacramento and Tolo coun
ties, lost more than $5000 in a poker
game Monday night. The money was
won by a sporting man named F. B.
Allen, who recently opened private
clubrooms in this city. Lovdal had a
streak of hard luck and when the game
ended Allen had Lovdal's signature to
a note for $5000 besides winning some
coin. The greatest secrecy has been
thrown about the affair, with the re
sult that it did not become known un
til to-day. It is said that a prominent
business man. whose name has not
not been mentioned, was also a player
at the eame.
Lovdal has protested the note at
various banks, on the ground it is
claimed, that a gambling debt is not
coyectable. Elwood Bruner, his attor
ney, declined this afternoon to discuss
the incident further than to say that
the sum named in the note was $5000
and that the matter would be satisfac
torily Bettled. The attorney said he did
not know where the game took place.

MAKES A PLEA
OF INNOCENCE
Joseph Te'shara, Under Sentence
of Imprisonment for Murder,
Denies That He Is Guilty
ISSUES LONG STATEMENT
Although Twice Convicted of
the Crime, He Asserts That
He Did Not Kill G. D. Loucks
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 17.â Joseph Tes
hara, who will be taken to Folsom this
week to serve a sentence . of ninety
years' imprisonment for murder, has
issued a statement in which he de
clare? he is innocent. He is accused of
having murdered G. D. Loucks in the
latter's saloon and twice has been con
victed of the crime. His statement is
as follows:
/ February 16, 190*. â¢
To thÂ» Citizens of Santa Crui â '
As It Is only a matter ot a few days until I
ehall bÂ« taken to the State prison. I feel called
upon at this time to make a brief statement to
the public.
As It is well known. I was informed against
by the District Attorney for the crime of mur.
der alleged to have been committed on Feb
ruary 10. 1300. to which Information I entered
a plea of not guilty. That plea of not guilty
still stands and shall forever stand.
Two different juries of my own choice and
selection have passed upon the case and In
each Instance their verdict was one of guilty
of murder In the second degree. Yet the find
ings of both Juries have not made me guilty,
nor could any number of Juries make me eo.
In the sigh* of God and In my own sight I
know that I am innocent and I have- nothing
to fear. "As true as there is a God In heaven
and as I hope for mercy at his hands, there
has been a serious mistake made, and I am
being- sent to Folsom prison not a criminal, but
a victim. Still, I have not abandoned hope,
and I shall continue, with all the courage of
Innocence, to battle for the freedom that 1
havÂ« 60 mlstakedly and unjustly been de
prived of.
All Is hard, but the hardest of all Is the
sorrow that my misfortune has wrought upon
the heads of my friends and those dear to me.
and the leaving of my old father broken
hearted and alone.
To my many friends I wish to express my
deepest gratitude and appreciation, and for you
all there shall always be a warm spot In my
heart.
For those whose pride of opinion and preju
dice Is enlisted against me. for -the District
Attorney who has prosecuted me. for the Judges
and juries who have passed upon the case, and
for the witnesses who have rendered testi
mony against me, I have not the slightest
feeling c* animosity or 111 will, bearing for
them each and all nothing but the best of good
wishes.
For my attorney, Mr. Carl E. Lindsay, I
cannot find words with which to express my
gratitude and praise for the able and vigorous
defense he made in my behalf. No attorney
wasypver more faithful and loyal to a client
than has .been Mr. Lindsay to me.
The angels bear me witness. I will say good,
by, remaining still a man and not a murderer.

LOWENBERG TEA
ON SATURDAY FOR
CLUBHOUSE

the philanthropic" work of the State,
has taken up the issue with both shoul
ders, henoe the generous offer of Mrs.
Lowenberg of her beautiful home for
the affair of Saturday. "Who's going?"

answered.

Y-csition to meet the evident wish of
the Japanese to rush matters to a de
cision. "Russia ran ailortl to wait," is
a common expression here, and time
and patience alwavs have been strong
allies of the emjjire of the north.
At Port Arthur to-day the ther

cero. The concentration of Russian
troops will proceed as rapidly as pos

Viceroy Aleiieff vn\\ not take the ag
gressive until h? feeis certain of his
ability to administer a decisive defeat.
Therefore, in spite of the extensive
landing operations of the Japanese in
Korea, an important land fight is not
considered here to be imminent, al
though it is believed that the passage
of the Yalu River by the Japanese will
be disputed.

RUSSIA'S REPLY TO HAY.
Russia's reply to Secretary Hay's
note on China probably will be made in
a few days. It will acquiesce in prin
ciple, but with certain reservations re
garding Chinese administrative control
over the regions in Manchuria leased
to Russia or covered by the Chinese
Kastc-rn Railroad, in. order to safeguard
existing Russian interests. When the
note was first dispatched to the powers
the authorities here undeniably were
disposed to view it, with suspicion, and,
therefore, its reception by the other
Cabinets was awaited with keen inter
est. As the Russian authorities have
obtained the views *f the European
chancellories and, have seen the friend
ly reception given to the note, even by
Russia's ally, the fear that it "might
contain a hidden pitfall for" Russia be
gan to disappear. The Russian author
ities have now been made acquainted
â with the replies of the remaining pow
ers, including that of Japan, and it has
now practically been decided to give
adherence in principle.
Russia explained that she was as
anxious as the other powers to prevent
disorders in China and to preserve Its
integrity, but that, owing to Russia's
especial interests in Manchuria, diffi
culties were presented. Her railroad
must be protected, and Russia would
make a reservation on this point The
Government did not desire her position
in this respect to be misunderstood
hereafter and for this reason her words
ivould be explicit and not equivocal.
Russia has not yet given permission

have been received from all the powers,
Including the United States, and It Is
understood that Viceroy Alexieff, to
whom the question was referred, would
prefer that foreign attaches should not
join in the Russian field operations un

unexpected suddenness of the outbreak
of hostilities it is difficult to make ar
rangements for . their comfortable ac
commodations, especially during the
severe weather.
GOJvS TO SUCCEED STARK.
The departure of Vice Admiral Mak
aroff to take the place of Vice Admiral
Stark in command of the Russian fleet
at Port Arthur was marked by impres
sive ceremonies. The admiral went to
the Church of St. Andrew and there
took the sacrament at the hands of
Father John. An hour later a great
crowd of school children, naval officers,
literary men, ordinary citizens and two
choirs assembled before Admiral Mak
arofTs house. There was a scene of
great enthusiasm, the crowd cheering
and singing:, after which the leading
officers and citizens entered and a sol
emn religious service was held. The
admiral, in a speech, thanked the
naval officers for their good wishes. He
said:
"There is warm work out there. They
â want men. so I am going. "We have
got to stand by each other now."
The admiral took a large staff w|th
him, including engineers, naval archi
tects and others.

GEJiMAN ADHIEALTY
PAMPHLET REVIEWS
KUSSIAX BLUNDERS
BERLIN, Feb. 17. â The German Ad
miralty discredits the reports that the
Japanese fired on the German gun
boats' Hansa, Thetis or any other Ger
man war vessel in Far Eastern waters.
The Hansa Is at Tsingtau and the The
tJs at Chefu. The regular reports of
their movements to the admiralty
make no mention of such an incident.
If it occurred it is assumed to have
been an excusable mistake.
The Marine Rundschau, the semi-offi
cial publication of the Admiralty, has
issued the first of a series of pamphlets
designed to keep German naval officers
informed as to what is occurring in the
FarV East and the meaning thereof.
After reciting the preparations on both
sides and giving official estimates of
the strength of the fleets, the Marine
Rundschau says:
"The Russians fired the first shot
from the Korietz, doubtless because the
Japanese torpedo-boats were creeping
near. The Russian Port Arthur squad
ron relied too much on protective nets
and obviously was surprised. The
commander made a serious blunder in
having two ships at Chemulpo and one
at Chefu, separated from the main
body. If these ships were sent to ob
serve the Japanese they did it badly.
"When the Japanese squadron with
drew (from Pprt Arthur) on February
10, the Russians ought to have followed
and kept in touch with it by means of
swift scouts, as the Russian command
er is now Ignorant of where it went. '
"The conduct of the Russian ships in
retiring to cover In the inner harbor in
dicates that they will not again engage
the enemy at sea. In the harbor many
of the Russian guns will not be effect
ive."
ALEXIEFF APPEALS
TO THE PATRIOTISM
OF RUSSIAN FORCES
PORT ARTHUR, Tuesday, Feb. 16.â
The text of the order of the day issued
to the troops by Admiral Alexieff to
day follows:
"A heroic army and fleet have been
intrusted to me by his Majesty the
Emperor, and now, when the eyes of
the Czar of Russia and of the world
are upon us, we must remember that
It Is our sacred duty to protect the
Czar and the fatherland. Russia is
great and powerful and If our foe is
strong this must give us additional
strength and power to fight him. The
spirit of the Russian soldiers and sail
ors Is high. Our army and navy know
many renowned names which must in
this hour serve as an example to us.
Our God, who has always upheld the
cause that is just, Is doing so now.
Let us unite for the coming struggle;
let every man be of tranquil mind in
order the better to fulfill his, duty,
trusting in the help of the Almighty,
and let every man perform his task,
remembering that prayer to God and
service to the Emperor are never
wasted.
"Long live the Emperor and the
fatherland! God be with us! Hurrah!"

of the main branches of the army, con

a division of guards, was going on
board transports. The previous land
ings of Japanese forces in Korea and
elsewhere are said to have been small
compared with this simultaneous sail
ing of three divisions, aggregating ap
proximately an army of 30,000 to 50,
000 men. The Japanese authorities, it
is added, have taken every precaution
to prevent information going out con
cerning the embarkation and the des
tination of this army. It Is believed
that the destination of this force is a
point near the mouth of the Yalu
Riverâ a spot on the Liaotiing Penin

Another official dispatch says a Jap
anese transport has been sighted off a
town south of the Yalu River. It is"
added that â¢ it is not connected with
the embarkation of the three divisions
referred to, but is considered to be a
confirmation of the reports that the

message, briefly describing the engage
ment, which came from the Govern
ment in Toklo, reads:
"The first fleet of torpedo destroyers
left for Port Arthur on February 13 In
spite of a heavy storm of wind and
snow. At 3 o'clock on the morning of
the 14th the- fleet attacked the Russian
ships and was fired upon, in spite of
which the destroyer Asakiri torpedoed
a Russian man of war and escaped
safely. At 5 o'clock the same morning
another destroyer, the Hayatori, went
close to the entrance of the port, where
two Russian warships were stationed.
One of them was torpedoed and a safe
return was made."
STORM SAVES THE RUSSIANS.
TOKIO, Feb. 17.â A heavy storm
spared the Russians from a desperate
torpedo attack at Port Arthur on the
morning of Sunday, the X4th inst. Dur
ing the preceding night the vessels of
the Japanese flotilla of torpedo craft
were parted by the force of the blind-
Ing snowstorm, so that only two- of the
larger destroyers succeeded in forcing
their way through the fierce gale to
Port Arthur. When they arrived there
they attacked separately and the offi
cers of one of them are confident that
they succeeded in torpedoing a Russian
warship.
The destroyer Asarglri, in charge of
Lieutenant Commander Ishlkaw, ar
rived off Port Arthur about 3 o'clock
in the morning and was met with a
sharp fire from the fortress and Rus
sian ships acting as scouts. The Asar
giri discharged several torpedoes at a
big warship, but the result is unknown.
A cannonade was opened upon the
scouting vessels and maintained until
they withdrew.
The destroyer Heyatory, Lieutenant
Commander Takenoucnl, arrived two
hours after the Asargiri and ran cloce
up to the mouth of the hafber, where
she found two warships, names un
known. She fired a torpedo at one and
the torpedo exploded.
Admiral Togo, in reporting the at
tack, says that, although the results
are unknown, he feels sure the moral
effect upon the enemy will be excel
lent. Commander Nagal commanded
the entire torpedo flotilla. The number
of the craft in the flotilla and the point
of their departure is concealed.

KOREAN GOVERNMENT
OPENS PORT OF WIJU
TO WORLD'S TRADE
WASHINGTON, Feb. .17.â American
;*MInister Allen, at Â« Seoul, cables the
State Department that Wiju has been
declared open to the commerce of the
world by the Korean Government.
The United States was the first pow
er, so far as known, to apply to the
Korean Government for the opening of
Wiju to the world's trade. This action
was taken while Japan and England
were urging the opening of -Yongam
pho. lying at the mouth of the Yalu
River on the Korean side. The view
taken by the State Department waa
that if we could secure the Opening of
Wiju, 130 miles up the Yalu above Yon
gampho, the effcet would be to prac
tically open the whole stretch of that
river to commerce, so that the project
really was much larger than- the mere
opening of a port at the mouth of the
river. Wiju lies on the opposite aide of
the river and very near to Yangtung.
in Manchuria, which the Chinese Gov
ernment, by treaty with the United
States, has already declared to be an
open pnrt, although this has never
been admitted by Russia. It Is under
stood that the opening of Wiju is di
rectly attributable to Japanese ascend
ancy In Korea, for while the country
was under Russian influence Allen, the
American Minister, wai unable to in
duce the King: to open a single port In
addition to Chemulpo. It is probable
that thÂ« State Department will at once
take stt-pa to have America represented
at Wiju by a consular or commercial
agent.
SPEAKS IX PRAISE
OF THE SYSTEMATIC
3IETHODS OF JAPAX
W. McC. Osborne. collector of cus
toms of the port cf Fusan, Kijrea, has
been a .guest at the Palace Hotel for
several days. He left the Orient about
two months ago owing to Ill-health
and after a three weeks* stay at St.
Helena he has returned to this city
to await the sailing of the next steamer
for the Orient. Osbc-rne has been in
the Orient for many years and was
formerly connected with the Chinese
customs service, being transferred to
Chemulpo as collector of customs dur
ing Chlna'8 suzerainty over Korea and
later was sent in a similar capac'ty to
Fusan. After th* Japanese-Chinese
war he entered the Korean customs
service and has since officiated at the
last named port. In discussing the
present war last evening Osborne said:
"We have known for more than two
years that Japan was looking forward
to war with Russia ana quietly pre
paring for an expected hard strife. At
Fusan the majority of the population
is Japanese by several thousand, the
foreign representatives numbering only
fifty or sixty. Japan has evidently set
tled on Fusan for a base. The harbor
Is a magnificent one. being able to shel
ter twenty or thirty men of war. The
Japanese have long maintained a gar
rison there of about 130 men under the
provisions of the Russian-Japanese
agreement, and some years ago Japan
also established a cc-alin? station there.
As far back as three years Japan.was
anticipating trouble with Russia â¢ by
rushing through the railroad between
Seoul and the port of Fusan, a distance
of 270 miles. Constructive work was
begun at both ends and thirty miles
of road have already been built in the
two directions.
"In Fusan the sentiment of both the
Japanese and other foreigners Is natur
ally in favor of the little brown men,
whom- we have expected would readily
defeat the Russians on the sea and give
them a hard battle on land. We have
expected a long war, but at times we
have questioned Japan's ability to ul
timately hold her position.
"The cablegrams of this morning de
scribing Japan's transportation of large
bodies of troops by water is no surprise
to those who are acquainted with her
transport service as I am. I really be
lieve that she has the best service of
this character in the world. I had
plenty of opportunity to watch the
movements of her mighty army during
the war with China. I saw her trans
port 30,000 troops to Chemulpo without
a hitch. They were moved like clock
work and so quietly that they hardly
attracted attention. She has laid in
large quantities of supplies for her
army, has plenty of coal, ample con
struction and repair facilities for the
needs of her formidable navy and in
other respects is on a war footing never
before attained by any other nation In
such a short space of time."

PARIS, Feb. 17.â In a dispatch from
Harbin, Manchuria, a correspondent of
the Matin Kays the Manchurian news
papers publish a manifesto by the Czar,
countersigned by the high mandarins,
which recalls the benefits China has
derived from the friendship of Russia.
Three thousand troops, the corre
epondent continue*, are crossing Lake
Baikal every day.
"The reports that the Russian officers
â were ashore when Port Arthur was
attacked on February 8 are absolutely
false," this correspondent says. "They
were all at their posts, for it was in
tended to have this squadron sail the
following morning for an unknown des

CAREER OF ALEXIEFF,
REPRESENTATIVE OF
CZAR IN FAR EAST
Eugene Alexieff, admiral of the Rus
6ian navy and the Czar's representative
In the Orient, Is about sixty years of
age. Heavy in build, broad shouldered,
full bearded and six feet tall, in all the
confidence of well preserved and robust
manhood and the full favor of his au
irust master, ''the "autocrat of all the
Russias," he is certainly a striking
figure on the Far Eastern warscape.
Though trained for the sea the vice
Czar is an "all-round man," as the
5aying is â strategist on land as well as
by Bea, courtier, diplomat, financier,
business man and engineer, in fact few
men combine In one body more widely
trained and eminent qualities. He be
pan his career as a sailor and after
some years' service, cruising in the
Mediterranean, was made a lieutenant.
The next four years were largely spent
exploring, the Arctic shores of Siberia.
On the expiration of this service
Alexieff returned home by way of San
Francisco, stopping over for some
â weeks at Lor.g Branch, then the fash
ionable American summer resort, and
*r which he is to this day fond of talk
ing. On his trip through the United
States he made good standing with his
home Government by certain sugges
tions and action looking to a then pos
sible rupture between Russia and
Great Britain, and on his arrival in St.
Petersburg he was made a captain and
given the command of a ship.
Three years later Alexieff was made
an admiral, and as such commanded
the warship on which the present Czar
made his trip to the Far East in the
early nineties. It was on this voyage
that he became Intimate with and won
the full confidence of his future sov
ereign.
Later he was sent out as Governor
General of Russia's Far Eastern pro
vinces and there showed his great abil
ity as a diplomat and an administrator.
Alexieff was commander of the Rus
sian contingent of the allied forces
which marched to the relief of Peking
during the Boxer troubles of 1899-1900,
and afterward went home to become
Minister of Marine in the Czar's Cabi
net.
Last fall he was again sent to the
Far East as first Viceroy of Russia
In that part of the world. His author
ity within bis sphere is as absolute as
that of the Czar himself.
Aleatieff Is a good fighter when fight
ing is to be done, but also a man of
rare prudence, as was demonstrated in
the Peking campaign of 1S99-1900 and
in Chefu at the close of the Chinese-
Japanese war, when hJs coolness avert
ed a premature conflict between the
Russian and Japanese fleets. He is
very considerate of his men, fraterniz
ing with them -when occasion permits,
and is, as a consequence, extremely
popular with them.
Altxieff always appears in full regi
mentals, with all of his decorations In
evidence, and of them he has an un
usual number even for a Russian Vice
roy. Among these is the Cross of St.
George, the wearers of which, whether
privates or noble officers, are privi
leged to Elt at table with the Czar him
self. Ab the Vice Czar on the last
celebration of the day at Port Arthur
Alexieff sat at the table for several
hours, one of a gathering in which
there were many private soldiers and
non-commissioned officers, the least of
whom for the time was his recognized
equal. â¢-*'â¢ '
Admiral Alexieff has gone and com*.
through San Francisco several times
ard acquired quite a liking for this
city. It is largely due to this, it is

I SECRETARY MOODY
DRAWS LESSOX FROM
RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR
BOSTON, Feb. 17.â Secretary of the
j Navy Moody, speaking at the annual
dinner of the New England Rubber
Club to-night, strongly advocated a
large navy and declared that if the
United States desired to maintain peace
j it must be known that at all times it
was ready for war.
Secretary Moody declared that there
was never a time when the importance
of power upon the sea was more mani
fest than it was to-day. He referred
to the Russo-Japanese war, and pointed
out that, although one of the nations
| was superior in many ways to the
other, yef the weaker nation, by her
j success on the sea, had rendered every
j part of her territory secure from in
j vasion. He said in part:
; "The United States is weaker than
the other powers so far as submarine
and surface torpedo boats and other
boats under 1000 tons displacement are
concerned, but still is fifth in relative
naval strength and has under construc
tion a greater amount of tonnage in
ships than any other country except
Great Britain and almost as much as
that country. This is a great country
and it can afford a great navy, and the
world must know that we are at all
times ready for war.
"We are at peace with all countries;
we wish to continue and will continue
| in that happy relation if honest diplo
macy and just regard for the rights of
every nation "will maintain peace, but
we must provide a navy so as to pro
vide for war. If we are strong enough
to enforce the Monroe doctrine, we shall
\ never have to do it. Let us, then, be
backed by God and by the sea, which
he hath given us for defense. In them
and ourselves our safety lies.
"To bring about the sea strength, I
believe national honesty at home is
most important. We must fight pub
! lie dishonesty as if it were a loath
i some disease. If money that is appro
priated to the building of ships be di
rected to improper uses, then the
J United States ships will be as If they
j were painted coffins."

SALONICA, Macedonia, Feb. 17.â
Shemsi Pasha, with 2500 Turkish troops
and three guns, is reported to be be
sieged by 20,000 Albanians at Babajhosi,
between Diakova and Ipek. The Turks
are said to be without food and water
and have already lost 100 men. Strong
reinforcements under, Shakir Pasha are
hurrying to the relief of Shemsi Pasha.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. 17.âSix
teen thousand Albanians are in revolt
in the district of Diakova against the
reform plans of the powers for Mace
donia, and obnoxious taxes. In con
flicts which have taken place between
Albanians and Ottoman troops, the lat
ter were worsted. Large reinforce
ments have been dispatched to Dia
kova. The Albanians attacked the
town of Diakova on February 13 and
plundered and burned a number of
houses. Turkish forces attacked the
insurgents' main position at Babajhosi,
but were repulsed with heavy loss.
Feverish activity continues among
the Turkish authorities on the Bul
garian frontier, in accumulating stores
and repairing roads for the expected
massing of troops.
LONDON, Feb. 17.â A dispatch re
ceived here from Sofia says that Rus
sia has officially notified the Bulgarian
Government that any encouragement
given by Bulgaria for the renewal of
the insurrection .in Macedonia will be
regarded as an act of hostility which
would be promptly and forcibly re
sented.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â Taking ad
vantage of Russia's preoccupation in
the Far East, Turkey is preparing for
war with Bulgaria. It is learned that
a march into Bulgarian territory is
likely to be made very soon. , In prep
aration Turkey has addressed a note
to each of the powers signatory to the
treaty of Berlin, in which she gives the
reasons for her attitude.
Besides legitimate war preparations,
it is learned that Turkey believes Bul
garia to be guilty of unlawful and
criminal traffic with dynamite, which
is being supplied publicly to the rebels.
The revolutionary committees, it is
stated, act undisturbed in all Impor
tant Bulgarian cities, notably in Sofia,
under the eyes of the Government and
with its encouragement. Active offi
cers of the army are permitted to join
the rebels.
Turkey is convinced that peace and
order cannot be restored by the paper
reforms conducted by foreign police
ignorant of the. complicated racial con
ditions of those regions and that they
can be restored only by war.
The Moslem population, it is said, is
beginning to take the matter of its
own protection against Macedonian
dynamiters and terrorists Into its own
hands.
The note sent to the signatory pow
ers Is likely to be the last information
given by Turkey before the rupture
takes place.

ARE REPULSED
PUERTO PLATA, Santo Domingo,
Feb. 17.â A savage attack on the city
of Santiago has resulted in the com
plete rout of the rebels by the Govern
ment forces. Many were killed and
wounded on both sides.
The attack of the revolutionists had
been expected for some time. On
Tuesday they entered the city un
molested until they had reached the
Government house. Then the Govern
ment forces opened flre. The rebels
answered and the battle raged for sev
eral hours. Polin Espaillat, one of the
rebel leaders, fell with a bullet wound
that broke his leg.
Panchito Perez and many 'other
revolutionists were killed, and, seeing
that their attack was futile, the rebels
fied, closely pursued by the Govern
ment soldiers. Espaillat was left on
the field of battle and made a prisoner
by the Government troops.
The Government . losses are /'not
stated, but two officers are known to
have been killed and several men
wounded.
RADIUM ACTS
AS PAIN KILLER
CHICAGO, Feb. 17.â A dispatch to
the Tribune, from Ann Arbor,
Mich., says: The possibility of us
ing radium to convert ordinary
rain and well water into .a min
eral water, more highly medicinal than
any known natural mineral water, has
been demonstrated at the University of
Michigan in a series of experlrrients
covering the last ten weeks. In search
ing for a method by which radium
could be applied to the interior of a
cancer without danger of the terrible
radium or X-ray burns, It has. been
demonstrated that the immersion of a
sealed tube in. pure, distilled water for
twenty-four hours produces radio-ac
tive water of powerful effects. In the
treatment of cancer this water stopped
pain in ten minutes.
The patients now under the radium
water treatment at the university are
one with a cancer of eighteen years'
standing, and several with the ordi
nary nose and breast cancers. The
eighteen-ypar-old cancer has had six
weeks of .water treatment, and from
the first five minutes' treatment ' pain
has been almost wholly absent. In each
of the .other ' cases pains stopped /im
mediately. ' t .\ â  . .
COMPANIES MAY
RENEW COMPACT
The return to this city of W. H. Av
ery, general agent of the Toyo Kisen
Kaisha Steamship Company, and R. P.
Schwerin, manager of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, Is anxiously
awaited by the many who are eager to
learn whether the two concerns, in
conjunction with the Occidental and
Oriental Steamship Company, are to
carry on business between this port
and the Orient in the future, as they
have in the past, under an agreement
entered into five years ago. This agree
ment expired two days ago and there
is much speculation as to whether the
representatives of the three steamship
companies have renewed It for another
fl-e years or some other period. A
report was in circulation yesterday to
the effect that the agreement had been
renewed, but no one hereVas willing
to confirm the story or to suggest Just
what understanding had been arrived
at between General Agent Avery of
the Japanese line and Manager
Schwerin, representing the two Harri
man companies.
Five years ;ago, when the Spanish
war demanded the services of the Pa
cific Mail Company's vessels for the
transportation of Government troops
arid material to the Philippines, the
Harriman people found it convenient to
enter into an agreement with their
Japanese rival, whereby^ the latter
should, for a period of five years, re
ceive a one-third share in all the Ori
ental business originating in this city
or at points afong the railroad lines of
the Harriman syndicate. Without
railroad connections the Japanese com
pany^ had found itself seriously handi
capped In competing for passenger and
freight business, and its agent gladly
accepted the proposition made by'Man
ager Schwerin, and its boats, the Nip
pon Maru, America Maru and the
Hongkong Maru, were quickly placed
on . the schedule time of the boats the
other company""nad been forced to use
for the Philippine traffic.
. . L'ately. these conditions have
been -reversed, the war with
Russia having compelled Japan
to . appropriate the Nippon Maru
and the' Hongkong Maru for military
service .arid no other boats have been
pu| in their places. With the agree
ment between the .steamship com
panies expired a few days "ago, the
Toyo I - Kisen \ Kaisha Company was
without a boat on the Oriental run
and the Pacific Mail and the Occi
dental and Oriental companies were
practically masters of the situation.
Just how. long the war will last is un
certain, .but it is certain that the Jap
anese company has no idea of aban
doning its ship connections with thf Â»
port and will have its steamers run-

WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â Rear Ad
miral Evans, commanding the Asiatic
station, to-day transmitted to the Navy
Department a cablegram from Com-'
mander Staunton of the gunboat
Helena, now in the mud dock at New
chwang, China, in which he says that
conditions there are. greatly disturbed
and that he is vigorously investigating
the report that Russian officials have
delayed certain American and British
merchantmen.
In the event that the American Con
sulate is endangered, It Is said. Com
mander Staunton will land bluejackets
and marines for the protection of Con
sul Miller. There is every wish oh the
part of this Government not to give
the. slightest cause for complaint by
either Russia or Japan, but the un
alterable American policy of protect
ing American interests at all hazards
will be adhered to.
The Russian Embassy Is being flood
ed with offers of assistance from
Americans in various walks of life.
Letters from twelve physicians arrived
to-day. The Russian Embassador has
been obliged to abandon his original
intention to answer each of these of
fers, with a personal letter, but a cor
dial letter of thanks Is sent by the em
bassy to each writer.
The offers are declined, as Russia
does not stand in need of medical or
military aid.
TREND OF BRITISH
SENTIMENT IN LONDON
AND IN THE FAR EAST
The London Daily News (Liberal) dis
trusts Germany's motives In the pres
ent crisis, and counsels non-interference
with Russia in her dispute with Japan
over Manchuria and Korea. It says in
an editorial on January 29:
"Will it profit us substantially to lose
the new-born friendship of France and
to aid the deep-laid plans of German
extension? Would it even profit us in
the Far East to find Russia hurled back
and her movement directed southward
to the Indian Ocean? Are we quite sure
that Russia is not a bulwark against
something even more to be fearedâ a
great Asiatic rising under Japan
against the dominion of the white man?
Do not let us dwell in any fool's para
dise as to the aims and motives of the
Japanese., They do not love us any
more than they love any other inter
loper in Asia. Russ'ia stands in her way
to-day. If she win she will kill two
birds with one stone â she will have
turned Russia and England against
each other in Southern Asia. And then
in due season she will enjoy the plun
der and will realize her dreams of 'Asia
for the Asiatics,' with herself as the
leader in the new empire. We heartily
detest Russian diplomacy, but it is not
our business to cure those evils of her
governmental system while under our
own flag we are setting up such a con
dition of things as that which prevails
In the Transvaal.
"So far as the antagonists are con
cerned we repeat what we have said
throughout the crisis â that true wis
dom consists in recognizing the fact
that thev have to accept each other as
neighbors. If Japan hopes to beat back
Russia utterly she is nursing a vain
dream: if Russia Imagines that Japan
is a mere Oriental barbarian to be bul
lied into surrender, that, too, is to in
vite disaster. We do not take the view
that the trouble is incapable of cure
without a surgical operation. Russia
must recognize that Korea is not her
portion, and on the other hand Japan
must not take too high-handed a course
in regard to Manchuria. In Europe we
have learned to tolerate near neighbors
with a certain amount of cheerfulness
and even security. There is no reason
why the same thing should not be pos
sible in Asia."
The Japan Mail, an English paper
of Yokohama, said on January 23:
"Germany has received a good deal
of attention at the hands of Japanese
journalists of late â the Nippon has
CARNIVAL ENDS
IN BLOODSHED
ROME, Feb. 17. â The carnival fes
tivities have resulted in disorder and
bloodshed in Southern Italy and Sicily.
Troops and police were obliged to in
tervene and a score or more persons
have been wounded. Many arrests
have also been made.
At Trani a number of Socialists in
masquerade costumes started the
trouble by insulting state institutions
and in the fighting which followed
several officers and soldiers were
wounded. The police then stepped in
and as a. result the Jail is now full.
At Piazza Ameria, in Sicily, the mas
querading brought on a conflict be
tween members of two local political
parties and an attack was made on the
City Hall. The disorder became so
great that troops were called out and
fired on the people to disperse them.
Fourteen of the rioters were wounded.
Quiet was then restored.
ning again as soon as the Japanese
Government sees fit to release them.
It is generally believed that General
Agent Avery, who is invested with full
power to act in all matters concerning
the foreign company, has come to
some understanding with the Harriman
representatives during his stay in the
East and that the three lines will con
tinue to operate under an- extension
of the agreement of the last five years.
The fact that Avery has been paying
his usual annual visit to Washing
ton for the purpose of arranging rates
for the carrying of .Government oÂ£
ficials to and from the Orient
strengthens the opinion here that the
American and foreign lines will con
tinue business on a friendly basis.

written about her, the Kokumin has
written about her and the Niroku has
written about her. This last journal
c-alls her a kwaji-dorobo and, affirms
that for many years she has been
nothing else. Kwaji-dorobo is a term
vulgarly applied to a man that takes
advantage of a conflagration to pur
loin the property of the unfortunate
victims of the catastrophe; a fellow,
in short, that profits by his neighbor's
calamities. The Xiroku is always more
vigorous than polite. Less indiscreet,
the Nippon affirms that among all na
tions Ilussia is regarded by the world
a* the most untrustworthy, and that
next to her in that unenviable distinc
tion stands Germany, for whose sake
the Nippon professes to be sorry that
things are so. This opinion is elicited
from our contemporary by the fact
that whereas the attitude of all the
other powers with regard to the situa
tion in the Far East is clearly known,
the attitude of Germany remains still
obscure."
The Mail also claims that Japan
will Justify confidence in her Inter
national morality. It continues:
"Less than four years ago, when the
foreign community in Peking, threat
ened with sanguinary destruction, re
posed its only hope of salvation in the
promptitude of succor from Japan,
not a few voices were loudly raised
in Europe against the danger of in
trusting to Japan a task which, if
successfully carried out, might invest
her with the practical hegemony of
Oriental races and thus call into real
existence the yellow peril. To-day, on
the eve of a war from which, if she
emerge successfully, it would be na
tural and reasonable that she should
claim some overlordship of the ter
ritory in dispute, we have the British
Government placing such confidence
In Japanese self-restraint and Japan
ese pacific impulses that they guar
antee her freedom from ambition in
the presence of temptations to which
any other nation, if history has been
truly written, would yield incontinent
ly and would not be condemned for
yielding. To-day no one seems to fear
that if Japan force her adversary to
loosen his grip upon Manchuria, she
will herself take his place or think of
retaining what she has won by
strength of arm?. It is a most sin
gular transition from unconcealed
doubt to unprecedented faith, and yet
we are absolutely confident that if
subjected to such a trial of her inter
national morality, Japan would justify
England's confidence."
The following interesting news Item
is contained in the Japan Mail of Jan
uary 16:
".News from Vladivostok says that
the ice is now a foot thick in the har
bor and that it has been found neces
sary to beach the torpedo craft. The
squadron of vessels lately reported aa
anchored in the port seems" to have
taken its departure, but nothina is
publicly known about its destination.
There can be no doubt that the de
gree of frost this year is exceptional
throughout the whole of the Far

Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Feb. 17.
In the estimation of A. C. Perkins of
Oklahoma the civilization of California
is already effete. The reason for this
opinion is that he now is serving a sen
tence of ten days' imprisonment im
posed on him by Judge Samuels this
morning for carrying concealed weap
ons. The gun which Perkins had was
certainly a formidable looking affair,
being a 44-caliber Colt revolver, with
a barrel fully eight inches long.
Last night Patrolman Gardiner ob
served the young man's hip pocket
bulged suspiciously while he was v.alk
ing near Telegraph and Central ave
rues asd accosted him. The result was
a hand to hand conflict Kith the citizen
of Oklahoma second best man. Th**
policeman handcuffed his prisoner and
took him to the City Prison.
After Perkins was sentenced this
morning he said:
"I was born on the plains of Okla
homa. There every man wears a re
volver at his belt fast the same as men
h^re wear necktic-s. I guess you' peo
ple out here are petting too civilixed."

PMAN LAWYER
WINS HER CASE
Mrs. Isabella 3fartin, Acting
as Her Own Attorney, Gets
a Verdict of Not Guilty
HAS A TRIAL BY JURY
Charge of Battery Was Placed
â¢ Against Her by a Tenant
Who Neglects to Pay Rent
Oakland Office Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 17.
Acting as her own attorney, Mrs.
Isabella Martin to-day secured her ac
quittal before a jury in Police Judge
Samuels' court on a charge of battery
preferred by Mrs. E. Bernardue. The
many legal battles in which Mrs. Mar
tin had been engaged preepared her to
conduct her own case, which she did
by examining the jurors, cross-examin
ing the witnesses of the prosecution
and presenting her own evidence. She
had several spirited tilts with Prose
cuting Attorney Green about the ad
mission of evidence and despite the
fact that her knowledge of law was
gained only as a litigant, she scarcely
came out second best.
The facts of the case as brought
out by the evidence were that Mrs.
Martin secured a writ of ejectment for
possession of a house occupied by Mrs.
Bernardue. Growing weary of the
law's delay, Mrs. Martin is allegel to
have taken things in her own hands
and to have forcibly ousted her ten
ant.
Mrs. Martin was much affected
when the jury returned a verdict of
not guilty.

PEEPING BACK
FIFTY YEARS
Witnesses Called Who W T ere in
Oakland Half a Century Ago
to Prove Title to . Land
CLAIMS COURTHOUSE SITE
Mrs? 1 Eugene Casserly Says
She Owns Part of the Prop
erty Never Before Disputed
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118" Broadway, Feb. 17.
What the site of Alameda County's
courthouse looked like fifty years ago is
the subject of inquiry In a suit now be
ing tried in which Mrs. Eugene Casser
ly is trying to assert her right to a
one-sixteenth interest in the. land now
supposed to be i worth $250,000. They
were all old witnesses who testified in
the building which has served Alameda
County as a courthouse for a quarter
of a century. ~*\"
Attorneys for the plaintiff rested their
case with the introduction of ; an old
Mexican grant of the land conveying
the title to Domingo and Vincente
Peralta, written in Spanish, and a deed
from them to Senator Eugene Casserly.
The claim is made that there the title
ends and that his interest lies in com
mon with the county and is a co-tenant
with the county.
The claim of District Attorney Allen
is that the county has been in undis
puted possession of the premises for
half a century and witnesses were
called to prove this.. George: Chase,
James Webster, Lasery Rosenberg,
Munro Hummeltenberg, Alfred W. Bur
rell, Henry Maloon and J. Tyrrel had
all known the premises from the early
fifties.
They stated that the land was first
used as a plaza. Where the courthouse
now stands there was a pavilion in
which they had fandangos. Sometimes
the place was the scene of a fair. One
of them remembered a man named
Sabe Harris who used to exhibit the
largest pair of oxen in the country and
the animals used Jo stand almost di
rectly beneath the judge's chair.
A square steel box served as a jail
and was called the calaboose. It stood
alone, was divided into two rooms and
stood without covering until one hot
day in midsummer a man was nearly
roasted in it and at night almost frozen
to death. A roof was afterward built
over it.
What was known as the Fulton en
gine house stood at another corner. The
old engine is still in use and is now
used for flushing sewers. The land was
the county's playground in those days
and has been occupied ever since.

After the election of officers, the an

then took up the subject of the East
Oakland Settlement. During the dis
cussion the president, Mrs. J. P. Ames,
said:
Our Eaat End work has been carried on
for years in the face of difficultiesâ in a build
ing altogether too inadequate to our needs â and
great credit Is due to our East End committee,
which has so bravely workefl among Â»o many
adverse conditions. More helpers are needed

every one can do and have a part in the good

to achieve in the near future is the building
at Camp Meeker of a Rest Home for our
young ladles here.
Following the address of the pres

Lead to Belief That Deceased
Was a Commercial Traveler
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. IT.
The cunning exhibited by the uniden
tified man who committed suicide on
Monday night by Inhaling gas at the
Pacific House In preventing identifica
tion of his remains has thus far baffled
the living. He died with -the wish, ex
pressed in a last letter to the world,
that no effort be made to Identify him.
His clothing, letters and even his um
brella handle had every vestige of a
name removed from them. Many per
sons called at the Morgue to-day, but
were unable to shed any light on tho
mystery-
Among the things left by the de
ceased were five memorandum books
bearing the stamp of various whole
sale houses in the East, principally In
the States of Kansas and Indiana.
This fact, together with his clothing
and general appearance, gives rise to
the surmise that he may have been a
commercial traveler. His handwriting
indicates that he followed some occu
pation in which there was much writ-
Ing. The right hand of the suicide was
marked with a scar .on the back and
the third and little fingers were bent
so as to prevent him from closing his
hand completely. No other scars were
visible to serve to identify him.
The extreme pains taken to conceal
his name leads those in the Coroner's
office to believe he may have been a
man of importance or that there was
some unusual cause for him wishing to
remain unknown forever. The only
reason given by the deceased in his let
ter that he had made a failure of
life and did^not. want his relatives to
know.

Sanborn Fell Downstairs

Records Show Woman's Ar
rest at One Time for Acting
as Fence for Russian Crooks
!
An investigation has been made by
Detectives Dinan and Wren Into the
! death of Mrs. Mary Sanborn, which
j occurred at 230Â»i Third street early yes
i terday morning, and they have come
I to the conclusion that it was acciden
tal. Mrs. Sanborn and Daniel Ryan,
; a teamster living: at 8 Hampton place,
had been drinking In Mrs. Mary
Knighton's room. About 1 o'clock yes
j terday morning Ryan left the room
I and during his absence Mrs. Sanborn
started to leave for her room at 226
i Thfrd street. It is supposed that in
j going downstairs she missed her foot
ing and fell to the bottom, where she
I vras found in a dying condition by
i Ryan on his return.
Ryan carried her upstairs to Mrs.
Knighton's room, where she died in
a few minutes from a fractured skull.
Mrs. Knighton told the detectives that
â  before Mrs. Sanborn died she whis
; pered to her, "Charley did it," mean
i ing Charles Hamlin, who had been liv
j ing with her. Hamlin and Mrs. Knigh
j ton were arrested in view of the wo
j man's statement, but Hamlin was able
j to satisfy the detectives that he was
j not in the vicinity of 230'fc Third street
\ at the time of the accident. Captain
1 Martin later instructed the detectives
j to release Hamlin and Mrs. Knighton.
; FENCE FOR CROOKS.
Mrs. Sanborn had a police record.
i She was known as "Russian Mary."
j having been born in Alaska of Rus-
I sian parents fifty years ago. In the
j beginning of 1SS3 ten Russians, who
! escaped from a prison in Siberia, ar
j rived in this city, and Mrs. Sanborn
I became acquainted with them. They
j turned out to be criminals of the worst
! description. Mrs. Sanborn rented a
i house on Langton street and became
a "fence" for three of the gang â Ashani
Deker, Alexander Schinkovsky, alias
Sinke. and Martin Jschinsky.
These three men robbed the store of
j M. Prince in Santa Rosa in April. 1S93,
i and the store of E. S. Elkers, Sacra
! mento, in the following October, bring
, ing the stolen goods to this city and
' hiding them in Mrs. Sanborn's house
i on Langton street, where they were dls
! covered.
WOMAX GIVF.S TESTIMONY.
The three men were arrested on two
i charges of burglary each and Mrs. San
j born for receiving stolen property. The
j men were tried and convicted. Deker
,' was sentenced to serve nine years in
! San Quentln; Schinkovsky to five years
; and Jschinsky to ten years. The case
: against Mrs. Sanborn was dismissed on
; motion of the District Attorney, as she
I gave important testimony for the pros-
I ecution. After the men had been re
â  leased Schinkovsky, under the name of
i Jack Sanborn, and Jschinskr, under the
; name of William Hunter, were arrested
fcr burglary in Monterey County and
: each was sentenced on November 14,
â  1S00. to serve fifteen years In San Qilen
i tin, .where Schinkovsky died on Sep
| tember 27. 1902.

FRANK BUCHANAN, WHO WILL MAKE ' A TOUR OF THE LARGE
CITIES OF THE PACIFIC COAST IN THE INTEREST OF THE LA
BOR UNION HE REPRESENTS. ... i
Frank Buchanan, president of the
International Association of Bridge and
Structural Iron Workers, who arrived
In this city from Xew York City last
Saturday, is bringing about several al
terations in the various local unions of
iron and pile drivers.
Though President Buchanan has trav
eled across the continent effect these
necessary alterations, he also comes
with the idea of getting valuable in
formation on the subject of labor or
ganization and to learn the methods
used by local leaders in bringing about
the present satisfactory conditions. Mr.
Buchanan said last night:
As far as San Francisco Is concerned there
is little that I can do other than promote a
eense of harmony between the Pile-drivers'
Association and the international association
that I represent.
Local Union Xo. 1 should be affiliated with
the international association. Xo. 31 affiliates
and, as a result, controls the greater part of
the erection of structural Iron; therefore it
would greatly benefit it to join ulih us as
soon as possible.
As tor the pile-drivers, they do a great
amount of false work on bridges and steel
buildings, and I hope that with the assist
ance of Mr. McCarthy and a few others an
amalgamation may be accomplished, for there
Is no reason why the various branches of
â workers should not Increase their strength by
unity and at the same time work harmoniously.
Altogether. I think the workingman of San
Francisco should congratulate himself upon the
prevailing conditions, for not only is he able
to look out for himself, but be is in a position
to aid his brother /workers all over the world. S
While on the coast I will visit Seattle. Port'
land and Los Angeles and will endeavor to
Improve the labor conditions of the southern
part of the State.
In Xew York the situation is good. An
agreement between the employers and the
labor organizations is about to be signed and
the trouble U practically over. Sam Parks
has absolutely no Influence among the work-
Ingmen. The employers, according to my
idea, were not justified in acting as they did
toward the labor unions, but without a doubt
they had good ground for complaint against
the methods used by Parks and several other
representatives of bis caliber.
Mr. Buchanan Is accompanied by his

THREATENED STRIKE OF
N MILK DRIVERS CALLED OFF
In accordance with instructions from
the Labor Council, a halt has been
called on the threatened milkdrivers*
strike. , â¢ ;
The trouble was supposed to have
arisen from a dispute between two fac
tions of producers over the price
charged for milk. One combine Is
charging 52 50 per quart and the other
$2. The allegation was that the
drivers were standing in with the high
er-priced combine, but the council dis
credited the theory, as it will not be a
party to any element to aid producers
in raising prices.

GOOD PLACES
ON THE LIST
Talk That Republican Aspirant
May Be Named Secretary of
Yoscmite Valley Commission
LERMEN'S LONG LEASE
Gen. John H. Dickinson Ready
to Accepfc*thc Nomination for
State Senator inNinthDistrict
The duty of appointing a Commis
sioner of the Yosemite Valley, to fill
the vacancy caused by the death of W.
W. Poote, devolves upon the Governor
of the State. Mr.'- Foote was appointed
to the commission in 1897 by Governor
Budd and was reappointed by Gov
ernor Gage in 1901. One of the first
acts of the Yosemite Commission after
the appointment of Mr. Foote was the
displacement of the Republican secre
tary and the election of J._ J. Lermen, a
Democrat.
The fact that the latter has held the
office of secretary of the commission
for five years under Republican admin
istration has caused a deal of comment
In political Circles. The comments are
'of this style: "Why should not the ap
pointing power under a Republican ad
ministration recognize the Republicans
who go to the front and win victories
for the party?"
In the State Blue Book of 1S99 the
salary of the secretary was listed at
$600 a year. In the new Blue Book it is
rated at $1500. There has been no
actual change in the compensation.
The salary was probably 51500 per an
num when it was listed in the book at
5600. The low rating was probably
made for the purpose of reducing the
number of aspirants for the place.
Under the new apportionment of leg
islative districts, the counties of Marin
and Contra Costa constitute the Ninth
Senatorial district. In the Presidential
election of 1900 the Republican plurality
in Contra Costa County was 616 and
in Marin County 777, or 1393 in the Sen
atorial district. In the contest for State
Senator that year Charles JVI. Belshaw,
Republican, defeated his Democratic
adversary, James H. Wilkins. by 303
votes. The election returns indicated
that four hundred Republicans In Marin
County supported the Democratic nom
inee. The rule has long prevailed to
give the Senatorship to Marin one term
and to Contra Costa the following term.
It is now Marin's term, as Contra Costa
had an inning in 1900. The point, how
ever, is raised that Marin did not play
fair in the last contest, but on the con
trary put forth every exertion to de
feat the Contra Costa Republican nom
inee and elect a Marin County Demo
crat. There is talk of reprisal. It
would not surprise the politicians to
hear that Charles M. Belshaw had en
tered the field as a candidate for re
election. There is also talk that Mar
tinelli and Chapman will not have
everything their own way in the Re
publican camp of Marin County. Gen
eral John H. Dickinson is In^the field
as an aspirant for the Republican nom
ination. General Dickinson represented
the old Tenth district in the State Sen
ate throughout the twenty-third and
twenty-fourth sessions at the Legisla
ture. Subsequently he represented Con
tra Costa and Marin In the Senate dur
ing the thirty-second and thirty-third
sessions. He is a popular man and a
campaigner of the first grade.
At the meeting of thej State Board
of Harbor* Commissioners yesterday
the resignation of Donald de V. Gra
ham, wharfinger, was reluctantly ac
cepted. Eugene Cohen was elected to
succeed Mr. Graham. There is gossip
in political circles to the effect that
the appointment of Senator Frank
French to the position of Superintend
ent of Tugs and Dredges Is simply the
fulfillment pt a promise made at the
last session of the Legislature and does
not signify that he will be expected to
support either Bard or Oxnard for the
United States Senate at the next legis
lative session. . >

ASHES BLESSED
BY ARCHBISHOP
City Churches Observe Open
ing of the Lenten Season
With Appropriate Ceremonies'
FORTY DAYS' ABSTINENCE
Sermons Preached Admonish
ing* All to Deny Themselves
During Time q| Fasting
The Lenten season was ushered in
with appropriate ceremonies in the local
Roman Catholic and Episcopal churches
yesterday morning. Ash Wednesday
is one of the most Important fast days
of the Christian year and the attend
ance at early masses in the various
churches showed that the people real
ized the solemnity of the occasion and
are preparing for the forty days of
self-denial which will terminate in the
Easter rejoicing.
There was little out of the ordinary
annual routine In the day's services at
the churches. At St. Mary's Cathedral
a high mass was celebrated by Father
Dempsey. Prior to this the ashes had
been blessed by Archbishop Riordan
ar.d after the services they were dis
tributed to the congregation. At the
evening service a sermon was preached
by the Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast,
who spoke of the Importance of observ
ing the Lenten season. Similar services
were held in all the Catholic churches.
During Lent special will be
held on Wednesdays and Fridays. On
Wednesday's Instruction will be given
and on Fridays the stations of the cros3
will be observed. â¢
At St. Ignatius Church the ashes were
blessed by the celebrant at the 6:15
mass and afterward distributed. Serv
ices were held last night.
In the various Episcopalian churches
the special services for Ash Wednes
day were held according to the pre
scribed form. Brief sermons were
preached, admonishing the members of
the congregations to deny themselves
of luxury during the period of fasting
and devote more time to prayer and re
pentance.
TO BE ORDERED
OFF SIDEW ALKS
Board of Works Takes Action
to Cause Removal of Flower
Venders From Pnblic Streets
The Board of Public Works yesterday
referred to President # Schmitz, with full
power to act, the protest of the Retail
Florists' Association against allowing
the stationary flower venders to ply
their trade on Kearny and Market
streets and petitioning the board to
cause their removal from the public
streets. Schmitz expressed himself in
favor of putting a stop to the obstruc
tion of sidewalks in the manner de
scribed and will instruct Officer Beach
to order the venders off the streets un
der penalty of arrest. The attorney of
the Merchants' Association reported
that the venders were occupying the
streets illegally.
The board rescinded its former ac
tion in dismissing Michael Murphy
from his position as paver and adopted
a new resolution, suspending Murphy
for thirty days. The Civil Service Com
mission found Murphy guilty of neglect
of duty, but refused to concur in his
dismissal, which, it claimed, would be
too severe a punishment.
The board decided to ask City At
torney Long for an opinion as to the
contention of the Civil Service Com
mission that an employe may not be
dismissed without its permission, al
though it finds that charges against
him have been sustained.
J. J. Dowling was cited to appear
and explain, why he constructed three
side sewers In Ninth avenue and seven
side sewers in Willard street contrary
to the provisions of the charter requir
ing a deposit to defray the estimated
cost of the work. .
The â¢ communication from Grand
Juror R. C. de Boom stating that the
Street Department has neglected to
comply with the terms of a resolution
of the Supervisors adopted June 18, 1894,
declaring Clement street from Thirty
third avenue to Forty-eighth avenue
and Forty-eighth avenue from Clement
street to the Government reservation to
be open public streets was referred to
the City Engineer for Investigation. De
Boom says the city was paid 575,000 by
the United States Government for flfty
flve acres of reservation lands and the
opening of Clement street was part of
the contract of sale.
The Bureau of Streets and the United
Railroads were directed to repair forth
with certain portions of Third street
between Mission and Berry, the pave
ment of which shows many defects
since it was laid three months ago.
Accused of Robbing Soldiers.
Detectives "Wren and Ryan arrested
two habitues and the night clerk of a
lodging-house at 45 A Stockton street
last night and placed them on the
detinue book at the City Prison. Their
names are Mabel Wallace, Kate Dono
van and A. C. Cleal. Two discharged
soldiers, George N. Wilkie and Wil
liam McArthur, accuse the girls of
drugging their liquor with cigar ashes
and robbing them of $50 while they
were unconscious. Another girl,
named Irene, they allege, was in on
the deal, but she has not been ar
rested yet. The night clerk was taken
into custody on the suspicion that he
was Implicated in the robbery. The
soldiers claim that the women also
short-changed them to the amount of
$7. Wilkie had a check for $150,
which the women overlooked.
Sues Flynn for Damage?.
Sarah M. Williamson, who was
knocked down by a team owned by
John T. Flynn last July, sued Flynn
yesterday for $2100 damages. She
says the accident was due to the care
lessness of the driver employed by the
defendant.

DrvmKcnness, Nervousness and
Sleeplessness Caused by
DYSPEPSIA
Munyon's Paw-Paw Positively
Cures All Stomach
Ailments.
P^ MOTHER writing to Prof>ssnr Mun-
yon from a nearby city says: "My
son. through bad associations, became
addicted to strong drink, and we had al-
most despaired of saving him from a
drunkard's grave. Ills stomach and
nerves had become totally wrecked. Two
weeks ago my sister, who lives in San
Francisco, sent me a bottle of Paw-Paw
for him. and. stranere to say. it not only
cured his stomach trouble, but has taken
away all desire for alcoholic drinks. He
has gained 11 pounds in flesh, and now
eats well and sleeps well. May God bless
you for. giving the world this wonderful
medicine."
Surely this mother has reason to feel
grateful, and it is my opinion, previous-
ly expressed, that the clergymen In this
country could do no greater service to
the cause of. temperance than tuadvocate
the general use of my Paw-Paw, for by
its use drunkenness would be- lessened
and the morals and health of the com-
munity greatly improved.
A wife whose husband is addicted to
drinking can do nothing better for her-
self "or family than to get a bottle of this
Paw-Paw, and whenever her husband
feels the need of a tonic give him a ta-
blespoonful of Paw-Paw. She will find
that he will soon lese all cravings for
strong drinks â that his appetite will
soon become natural, that his nervous-
ness and longing for excitements will
disappear, and he will be perfectly sat-
isfied without alcoholic stimulants and
harmful beverages.
Almost every human being some tim^
requires a stimulant. NOT AN ALCO-
HOLIC STIMULANT, not a stimulant
that will buoy up for a moment and then
cast down to lower depths of depression,
but a stimulant that will give an abiding
strength and lasting force.
My Paw-Paw aids the stomach to di-
gest hearty foods and to make good, rich
blood, which again in turn strengthens
the nerves, vitalizing all the tissues, and
soon produces muscles, tissues and bone.
MCNTON.
Paw-Paw does away with thÂ«* desire for
strong drink by satisfying and strength-
ening the stomach and nerves. It gives
exhilaration without intoxication.
Paw-Paw gives you a good appetite
and secures for the body every benefit
which food Is designed to bring.
Take a bottle home with you to-day,
and if that home contains a w*-nk or re-
bellious stomach, a set of disordered
nerves, a vain seeker after sleep. Paw-
Paw will bring quick relief, and more
recruits will be gained for Munyon's
great, and growing army of the cured.

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES
BY NOTED MEN AND
WOMEN
To Be Bank President.
BT ELBHHXJE G. KEITH.
JFonr.iTly Present Metropolitan National
Bank Chicago: PrwiJent ChicaRO
' Title and Trust Co.J
fCopynght. 1H04, by Joseph B. Bcwlf*.)
l/?t th* young man who would be
come a successful bank president first
look around him that he may form as
intelligent an idea as possible of the
sort of men- who are called upon to
hold the guiding reins over the affairs
of large financial institutions. Next
he should gain at least a general
knowledge of the duties of a bank
jresident and then study closely the
methods by which men have made
their success in banking. Above all,
he will have to acquire a thorough
knowledge of the business itself, and
this, in most cases, will be gained by
actual experience in a bank. Early in
his career he will learn that he will
do well to supplement by hard study
the knowledge which he picks up in
performing his routine duties. In ad
dition to learning Jill he can about his
own business he should keep his eyes
open to what is going on in the out
tide world, particularly those condi
tions which have a direct bearing on
mutters of business and finance.
The president of a bank is the con
wrvator of the money deposited with
his institution along wiih the capital
representing the various stockholders.
The essential feature of his positjon is
to handle deposits in such a way that
they will show profitable- returns.
Upon him rests the responsibility for
making loans, from which the rev
enues of the bank are derived. This
requires a skillful knowledge of such
investments as will not only pay
profits, but which can be readiiy
turned into money In case of need.
From this it will be seen that the
bank president must have a compre
hensive knowledge of the general field
of mercantile and manufacturing
business and know the methods by
which business of various kinds is
transacted. In fact, he ehould be ac
quainted with the affairs of everything
on which he bases credit. For In
stance, in loaning money on stocks of
any kind he must know as to whether
their merits are near the price at
which they are being sold. It will be
to his advantage if he has touched
elbows with men of all lines of busi
ness, for he must be a good Judge of
human nature in addition to having a
broad knowledge of business affairs.
A business man comes to a bank presi
dent for a loan. The latter must not
only acquire a definite knowledge of
;he merits of that man's business, but
acquaint himself with the borrower's
reputation, business ability, general
Handing in the business world and also
bo able to read his character.
Generally when a young man goes
to work for a bank it is as a messen
ger. This "title" aptly designates the
duties he will perform. He will carry
the mails, collect city drafts and
< hecks and later on possibly be put
to work copying and directing the
mail. Thus he will lay the foundation
for his career as a "banker." One
thing of advantage he will gain in this
work will be contact with business
men. He also will become familiar
with drafts, notes and bills of lading,
and have an opportunity to learn the
meaning of the various terms used in
the banking business.
From messenger he will graduate
into the bcokkeeping department,
where he will first be put to work
copying and keeping a record of out
fÂ»f town clearing-house items. Thence
he will go Into the clearing-house de
partment, in which checks going into
the clearing-house are prepared. This
work wakes him up and tends to make
him rapid and accurate. Next he
would probably be advanced to the
position of statement clerk, whose du
ties conMft of keeping a record of
< hecks of certain depositors and oth
t-rvvisff helping to keep the bank's
books? in balance. By the time he has
proved himself capable in this work
he will be in line for promotion as a
1 ity bookkeeper. In which position he
will keep the accounts of merchants
and bankers doing business with the
bank.
It Is reasonable to Buppot>e that
after a young: man has had a thorough
training on tho books he will not only
know the inside workings of the bank,
but will have sained a pretty good
idea of the people doing business with
it and their standing. With this
knowledge he would be equipped to
become a receiving: teller, whose, work
It Is to receive deposits and .charge
them to the- proper departments. Pay
ing teller Is next in the line of pro
motion. The paying teller, with his
r-ssistants, looks out for all the money
paid over the counter acd has charge
of all the actual cash in the bans.
Then come the offlceVs of the bank
â assistant cashier, cashier, vice pres
ident and president. The duties of the
assistant cashier, of course, are di
rectly in line with those of the cash
ier, who is the responsible executive
head of the bank. This officer has
direct supervision over the heads of
all departments. In most cases, how
ever, the cashier is more than an ex
ecutive officer. With the broad
knowledge of business and business
people and the intimate acquaintance
of the bank's customers, which he
murt necesfiarily have, the cashier is
often called upon to do much. of the
same sort of work as the president,
and therefore in many instances the
jouns man who has worked his way
up to the former position will find
that he is a probable candidate for the
presidency.
The duties performed by the vice
president or vice presidents, as the
case may be. are. as a rule, parallel
to those of the president, who gener
ally has more work upon his shoulders
than he can do himself. Naturally,
however, the vice president does not
have the same responsibility for the
bank's affa!rs^as the chief executive.
In different banks the line of work,"
of course, varies somewhat, but In
most banks It Is about as outlined

Making Ends Meet.
BT CHARLES FREHERIC GOSS. D. D
[Author of "TTie Loom of Life." #tc]
(Copyright. 1K04. by Joseph B. Bcwlt*.)
I should say (off hand) that one-ha'f
of all the troubles of matrimony are
matters of money. The problem of
"making ends meet" "gets onto human
nerves." Its solution is a stern and
imperious necessity that haunts us day
and night. It can never be disposed of
for good and all, but recurs to-day with
the same horrible complexities as yes
terday and will come back to us to
morrow lust as grimly.
I have heard of a lunatic In an in
sane asylum who wanders around the
grounds trying to bring the two ends
of a rubber band together around the
trunks of the trees. The poor fellow
had gone crazy trying to "make ends
meet." And wasn't It quite enough to
drive him wild? Think of the genius
and the agony that you yourself have
put into the effort and theji multiply
this by the numbers of individuals in
your community, and you will form
some conception of the strain that is
bearing on the nerves of the human
race.
There are four or five combinations
which affect the success or failure of
people to make ends meÂ«t.
A woman is extravagant, when a
man is economical. (The agent of the
mortgage company Fays that this is not
the case in most of the homes of the
poor, and to this the superintendent of
a great insurance company agreed. If
the men would give their wages to their
â¢wives affairs would be greatly im
proved they think. Probably in the
better-to-do classes, where women are
treated as darlings rather than help
meets It is different.)
A man is when the wo
man is economical.
Both are thriftyâ and they become
misers.
Both are spendthriftsâ and they go to
ruin. .
Now, measure, if you can, the irrita
tions of surh possible relationships! A
man '"toils and moils" and sees his
hard-earned money scattered like chaff
before the wind. By and by he gets
sensitive, and thenâ morose. "What do
they care for me? All they value me
for is to earn money for them to spend!
I may wear myself out and drop in my
harness â and their only feeling will be
one of indignation," he says to himself,
until love dies in his heart.
Or a woman who longs for the noble
life that only thrift can procure, sees
her husband frittering away his money
on cigars, or dropping it into slot ma
chines, while ehe and the children have
scant share of the very necessities of
life. Xo wonder she broods over it until
she becomes embittered!
Reproaches begin to be heard. Quar
reling follows. Then comes separation
or the divorce court. -
Now, this is what I have to say. If
people want happy homes they must
arrive at a mutual agreement about the
â¢use of money. There are certain in
exorable laws which they break at their
peril. Along the path of obedience to
these laws, and along that path alone,
they may travel to the goal of domestic
felicity.
1. We must live within our incomes.
2. We must save something for
emergencies.
3. We must agree absolutely as to the
objects of expenditure.
4. " Neither one of us may indulge in
a purely selfish luxury.
5. Whoever handles the money ought
to give the other an "allowance."
Perhaps the last is not the least, for
nothing in the world so belittles and
degrades a grown-up person as to keep
asking for little driblets of mony. The
man who does not give his wife an
allowance does h*r a gross injustice
and dwarfs his own soul. She never
ought to have to beg. He nevef ought
to question her honesty or judgment. It
takes a saint not to become mean â If
he doles out money to his wife as if
she were a dependent. Such a woman
summoned up her courage one day and
asked her husband if he wouldn't take
her to the theater with him. His eyes
widened, and he replied in tones of sol
emn indignation: "Don't I always tell
you what I've seen and heard when I
come home? "What more do you want?"
A man ought to be a gentleman â to
be married. Nothing is more Imperative
and nothing more difficult than for hus
bands and wives to arrive at this per
fect understanding about the use of
their income. I have known of a
woman whose heart was broken into
little bits because her husband told her
that she was not "saving." She con
founded the word "saving" with "econ
omy," and felt insulted. She was eco
nomical, but not saving. "Economy"
makes money go a long way, but "sav
ing" lands it in the bank. Â» "Economy"
is good, but it is "saving" that turns
rainy days to sunshine. Women are
likely to be economical and not saving,
men to be saving an,d not economical.
Hear the conclusion of the whole
matter: No home will be happy where
money Is not expended wisely.
Worth Repeating.
The following from the Llvermore
Leader can bear repetition:
"The San Francisco Call is rapidly
coming to the front as the leading
home paper among the big dailies. No
better evidence. of this could be cited
than the fact that of its issue of Sun
day, January 31, there were printed and
distributed 85,440 full and complete
copies of forty-four pages each", requir
ing the use of over 50,000 pounds of
paper. We are pleased to note the rapid
strides of- The Call in the matter of cir
culation, as it is one of the brightest,
cleanest and newsiest of newspapers
and deserving of the Increasing support
which it is receiving."

RUSSIAN PRACTICES.
A SYMPOSIUM for Japanese and Russians had
been arranged in New York, that representatives
of the two nations might meet on neutral ground
and state their case, or merely enjoy social association
with Americans, if they would have it so. The Russians
stayed away, giving as-*a reason that American public
sentiment is' unfriendly to them.
Why should it not be so? Their country repeatedly
broke its promise to ours to evacuate Manchuria. It at
tempted to force China into the secret treaty of last year,
and when our Minister at Peking detected the scheme
and notified his Government of it Russia denied the
transaction and openly impeached the veracity of the
American Minister. Subsequently it was disclosed be
yond dispute that our Minister was exactly correct -in
his report. While our Government has properly main
tained a dignified attitude in the matter, its opinion of
the Russian sort of diplomacy has been expressed in its
continued confidence in our Minister. If Russia's at
tack on him -had been truthful, he would have been re
called for deceiving his Government to the disadvantage
of a friendly power.
The American people are free to express themselves,
and to go beyo'nd the passive attitude of their Govern
ment. Their disposition to do so has been enhanced by
the pro- Russian position of Mr. Michael Davitt. Amer
ica has its commercial rights in Eastern Asia, and will
use all the \ resources of diplomacy to prevent Russia
again closing the opposite coast. Pacific America is vi
tally interested, for the Asian coast is to our trade what
Europe is to the Atlantic seaboard. We won the Pa
cific Ocean with our navy in Manila Bay, and do not
propose to have it turned into a Russian lake.'
This country is aware of the ambition of Russia to be
the ruler of all Asia. That ambition is shown by the
Czar's testy temper concerning the British expedition in
to Tibet, and his designs upon the Indian frontier. Look
at the map, and drop the Russian frontier from Batoum
to the Persian Gulf and thence around Cape Comorin, to
include hither and farther India, Burmah, and, excepting
French Indo-China, the whole Asian coast to Vladivo
stok, and what use is the Pacific Ocean to us? Yet that is
the comprehensive plan of the Muscovite.
It is not venturing too far to say that with such a
Russia our own position will be exposed to the same
peril that is now upon Japan, for the grasping ambition
that is capable of such a plan will not stop with the con
trol of one coast of the Pacific. It is not in the interest
of the human race, nor of civilization, to permit the ag
gregation of such a power. Therefore, our diplomatic
move to protect the integrity of China.
We hqve committed no aggression upon Russia any
where, yet her brutal Cossacks have not respected our
flag and our consulate- American sentiment is fully
alive to what goes on wherever the Russian foot is
planted. Her soldiers have always been brutal wherever
a Russian army has appeared. The word brutal is used
with full knowledge of its unfitness, and its affront to
our brethren that breathe in the flesh, the beasts that
perish, for no four-footed thing, no reptile that crawls
crookedlj-, and no bird of prey that flies in the air, was
ever guilty of the atrocities of Russian soldiery on the
Rhine and in Asia.
The laws of war require safe conduct to non-comba
tants out of the territory of an enemy. The Japanese
civilians escaping from the Russian zone in Manchuria
have been robbed, beaten and subjected to unspeakable
outrage. The neutral rights of Germans and Americans
have been violated, and the Russian officers have failed
to control their fiendish subordinates. Japanese prison
ers of war have been treated with the utmost cruelty
and inhumanity, and, while these things have been going
on, not a Russian in Japan has been even demonstrated
against. The Russian Minister and his countrymen in
Seoul have been given safe conduct and treated with
respect, and wounded Russian prisoners of war are being
carefully treated in Japanese hospitals.
If Russia expect that these events will not impress
public sentiment in this country, then she has no con
ception of the civilization of the United States. War is
not what it was in the time of Rurik and things have
changed much since the days of Catherine II. Russia
cannot play the part of Hyder AH in the Carnatic, nor
even of Louis %IV in the Palatinate, and hold a place
among the civilized nations. Japan is recognized as her
superior in all the respects that make a country an ac
ceptable member of the family of nations. Two months
ago Russia appealed to Christendom for sympathy in a
controversy with a pagan nation. If her policy at home
and her practices abroad are illustrative of Christianity,
then give us pagandom in preference, if Japan be its ex
ponent. The Japanese persecute no one on account of
religion. They are hospitable to the rights of con
science, and yield to every man's altar the same respect
they desire to be shown to theirs. They are frank and
open and truthful in their diplomacy. The soldiers of
Japan abstain ftom robbery and. outrage, and they ob r
serve the laws of war as laid down in. the Geneva con
vention.
â¢The foregoing is, we believe, a fair statement of the
reasons that exist in our national policy and in the senti
ment of our people, for lack of sympathy with Russia in
this country. It will be seen that we have not manu
factured those reasons. They exist in the policy - and
practices of Russia herself.
An explanation of the unprepared condition of the
Russian fleet at Port Arthur is given in the assertion that
the officers of the fighting ships were interested spec
tators at a circus that evening. What an aggregation of
clowns these same officers gave to the world, though,
before morning dawned.- ';;n"Â«;i. ;
A CHAPTER ON MICROBES.
a BRUSSELS scientist has just announced to a
/\ listening world that in every clasp of the hand
â¢* *â¢ between man and man there lurks a danger of
hideous death. For, according to this savant, in this ex
pression of amity there are exchanged from 40,000 to
80,000 microbes of all degrees of virulence. A man may
thus wipe off upon the palm of his dearest friend enough
germs to start an embalmed beef factory or he may set
his deadliest enemy upon the quick path to sudden dis
solution. *A11 are not equally endowed by these patho
genic protoplasms according to the Belgian doctor. Sur
geons, sausage-makers, barbers, leather-dressers; 'and
dealers in the delectable tripe have, upon conservative
estimate, 80,000 mites to the square inch upon their
hands, and far up their arms. They should be pariahs in
the modern body antiseptic of this commonwealth of
science which is ours. â . ...... â¢ .
This priceless contribution to the knowledge of man-
kind which comes from over seas demands the instant
attention of every individual in every walk of life. For
now which of us is there who does not carry about upon
his innocent . palm forces more terrible than those
locked up in nitro-glycerine? Who is there who can truth
fully stand before the temple and announce to the ark
that he brings with him clean hands? Vain thought! We
are all of us but incubators of unrighteousness, more
perfect of action and more prolific of production than the
pride of Petaluma hatcheries.
Especially fearsome is this dread discovery of the pro
fessors, coming as it does upon the eve of a Democratic
convention, where the glad hand is to be extended and
the calumet of peace is to be handed around the motley
circle. Come William Jennings Bryan with the ancient
bug of the Kansas City platform just burning his palm;
Gorman, his dexter and sinister reeking with the anti-
Panama microtherm; Olney, now almost immune from
the Cleveland incubus, and all the rest of that motley
band of braves who are to gather in all harmony. When
the Parker hand, the Bryan hand, the Gorman hand, has
each passed about among the delegates its own particu
lar breed of germs and the fever begins to rise, what a
pitiable slaughter of innocents will there be.
There is only one way by which the convention dele
gates'may counteract the effect of this dreadful distri
bution of political microbes and hope to meet in a com
paratively sanitary atmosphere. Let each of the "unin
structed" come with medicated gauze upon his hands
and his ears stuffed with absorbent cotton, like Ulysses of
old, so that the piping of the sirens may not penetrate
unto his heart- Let there be ever in the air the spray of
an antiseptic engine to catch the bacilli which emanate
from the silver- tongued. and let it be the law that if
Bryan speak he must have chloride of lime in the crown
of his hat. ,
One of the victorious Japanese admirals now operating
with distinction in the Yellow Sea is a graduate of An
napolis. He was a good student and shows that he is a
sure master of the art of naval warfare. There is no
small measure of satisfaction in the thought that whoever
learns in our schools, of peace or of war is taught his
THE RUBBER SUPPLY.
THE presence here of Mr. Pearson, an expert in the
growth and supply of indiarubber, suggests again
that some investigation be made of the capacity of
California to grow some of the rubber-producing plants.
That important commercial article is furnished by a
number of trees and vines, some widely differing in their
botanical characteristics. The rubber from Central
America is furnished by the Castilloa alastica, related to
the breadfruit tree, and by the Manihot, connected with
the widely distributed spurge family of plants, as is the
Hevea, another large rubber producer. The East In
dian rubber is produced by the Ficus elastica, related to
the fig, and that of Africa by plants of the dogbane fam
ily. Much rubber is also yielded by a sturdy vine that
grows in Central and South America.
In. view of the considerable distribution botanically of
the rubber-yielding plants, it is quite worth while to
test them in California. Spurge is a quite common
American plant, distributed from our western deserts to
the north Atlantic coast. We have also plants of the
dogbane family and our fig tree is related to the Ficus
elastica. We have done so much in proving the hos
pitality of our soil and climate to exotics, entirely, how
ever, in the line of fruit and ornamental trees, that it is
worth while to test it in rubber. If the Agricultural De
partment at Washington would undertake it, in some of
its experimental stations in this State, the result would
be watched with interest. Most of the rubber-producing
plants are of quite rapid growth and of long life. The
isothermals of their habitat extend into California, and
only experiment can prove absolutely that they cannot
be made profitable .here.
The industry has the advantage of the absence of dis
eases and lack of insect enemies of the tree. Mr. Pear
son reports that in the East Indies, where the coffee and
tea plantations are exterminated by predatory insects,
the rubber is being substituted with success. There is a
fascination in this quest for plants of economic value,
that may be made profitable here. It has already
brought to us the whole citrus family, and the Greek fig,
and the date, and is about to domesticate here the finest
and highest priced date known, which will grow on the
Colorado Desert. Only trial and experiment have pro
duced these results, which are merely a prospectus of
what may be continued by effort and adventure in that
The Agricultural Department has just decided to es
tablish an experimental station on fifty acres of land near
Chico, and it has other stations in Southern California.
It is to be hoped that our members of Congress will
urge that rubber plants, especially those of the spurge
and ficus families, be experimented with in both locali
ties. Many owners of land would be glad to experi
jnent themselves, if the department can supply them
with the plants and with such information as it pos
sesses, or can secure, as to the methods of growth. ~
Reports of a general raid by thieves upon the money
arid jewels of American women resident and participat
ing in the gay whirl on the Riviera have been persistent
elements of news from Europe for several days. Thje
only feature of these stories fortifying their truth is that
there is not a single actress or prospective histrionic star
among the alleged victims. .
A COME-OUTER.
THE speech for Panama, the President and the canal
treaty made by Senator Clark of Arkansas was
the brave act of a come-outer. It was a frank,
bold and deserved indorsement of the President by a
Senator belonging to a party whose ancient policy held
in the days, of its vigor has been carried out by the
President in his dealing with Panama.
The Senator. pointed to the States in the South whose"
Legislatures reflect public sentiment by instructing their
Senators to vote for the treaty. Texas, Louisiana and Mis
sissippi have all so instructed, and. in other Southern
States the great commercial- bodies have done the same.
Senator Clark argued from this that the Democratic
party is not anti- Panama, arid that" it is not opposed to
the President's action and policy, and that position is
probably well taken. This means that the time spent by
Mr. Gorman in trying to make a party issue of it has

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
The Doctor's Violets.
Dr.* Al McKenzie has a keen ap
preciation of the fitness of things.
Like all - model men, he be
lieves In hieing himself to his
family fireside immediately after the
cares of the office, there to remain, safe
out of harm's, way, except on lodge
nights of the knights Templar. How
ever, one day recently the doctor was
detained uncommonly late downtown
with some lodge members, discussing
the figure 8's they were to cut in the
next competitive drill of the ccrmman
dery. The time sped^on until the doc
tor noticed that It was far past his
dinner hour.
Something must be done. He finally
decided that he would bring'to his fam
ily a floral peace offering in lieu of
an olive branch. A beautiful bouquet
of violets was bought. He walked to
a corner and stood awaiting a car, hold-
Ing the flowers behind him out of
harm's way. Suddenly he felt a nib
bling and knew intuitively that all was
not well with the blooms. He looked
into the darkness and there stood a
meek-eyed horse licking his chops over
the last of the fragrant blossoms, hav
ing graciously left their stumps for the
doctor. Recognizing that fate was
leagued against the righteous, he board
ed the car for home, confident in his
power to explain away that which the
mute tongued but fickle violets had so
miserably failed to do.
r A Forlorn Hope.
"Judge," gasped a wfld-eyed young
fellow the other day as he rushed into
the chambers of Justice of the Peace
Lawson, "have you recorded my mar
riage license yet?"
"No," replied the Judge, recognizing
the young fellow as a man whom he
had married only the day before.
"Thank the Lord," came with a sigh
of relief from the lips of the breathless
young fellow. "She left me this morn
ing and skipped out with a soldier who
had Just got paid off. I got here as
quick as I could, as I knew that un
less the license was recorded we were
not married."
He almost fell in a faint when the
Judge told him that recording the li
cense had no effect on the marriage.
"I am sorry." said the Judge, "but you
are still very much married."
The Line of Life.
It is not generally known that the
late Police Judge Campbell was told
by a female palmist a few months prior
to his death that he had not long to
live and that his death would be sud
den and unexpected. The Judge at
the time was in robust health and
looked far from his end.
It was at a case in his court when
one of the witnesses declared she was
a palmist. While being cross-examined
the attorney scoffingly referred to her
alleged mystic powers, making her
angry. The Judge In a spirit of fun
put out his right hand and said: "Can
you tell my future?" The palmist
looked at the lines on the palm of his
hand for an instant and remained
silent.
"What do you see?" asked the
Judge, and the woman replied: "I
would rather not say." The Judge in
sisted and she said: "Well, I can see
that the life line is broken and that
you will meet with a sudden death be
fore this year is out." The Judge
laughed and said he was more than
ever satisfied that palmistry was all
humbug.
The prediction of the palmist was
fulfilled. In a few months the Judge
was laughing and joking one night
with some friends at the headquarters
of the Order of Chosen Friends when
he complained of a pain in his heart
and- died in a few minutes.
Me and Pat McBride.
Stretching away on every hand,
A fair domain you see â
A part belongs to Pat McBride,
A part belongs to me.
I own the golden light of morn.
With all the tints that play
Upon the springing grass and cornâ
Pat owns the corn and hay.
I own the catbird, thrush and jay.
The larks that sing and soar;
Pat owns the barnyard fowls that stay
About the stable door.
And when the shadows on yon stream
Are changing every hour.
I own the right to float and dream,
Pat owns the water power.
Mine Is the murmur of this rill.
Whose sweet tones never cease.
But all the air with music fill
Pat owns that flock of geese.
I own yon creamy summer cloud
That o'er the meadow floats
Like some pure angel in a shroud-
Pat owns the Berkshire shoats.
So Pat does me a world of good.
While I do Pat no harm â
And on these terms well understood.
We both enjoy the farm.

Leap Year in the Senate.
A Western Senator, whose name is
suppressed, but who ranks among the
eligible widowers of the "august Sen
ate," was the recipient of a leap year
proposition the other day. Nebraska
is conspicuously In the eligible list, and
possibly the tender suggestion points
our way. Evidently it reached a Sen
ator who was not in a receptive mood,
else the heart-appealing missive would
not appear in the garish columns of
the Post. The lady in the case hails
from Kansas and this is her style:
"Dear Senator: I read you are one
of the widowers of the Senate who
would more than likely be the one who
would be next to get married. Now, I
write you this to ask you, if you are
not engaged to any lady, if you would
consider myself as a candidate for that
sacred trust. I am a widow, 56 years
old, and should like a good and loving
husband, one whom I could love and
trust. I find life too lonesome to live
without a good man. You may think
this very impertinent in me to writa
you, but I assure you I am no ad
venturess, only one who is so lonely,
and there are no eligible men In this
town.
"I will wait with patience .your an

self and who I am."

missive was written by his secretary.

an anecdote of old-time Tennessee poli
tics. He prefaced it with some refer
ence to. the defeat of Meredith P. Gen

Andrew Johnson, afterward President.
Gentry went into a state of decline soon
after the election, his wife died and he
was chagrined because he "had been
run over by that calf." having held
Johnson in great contempt.
"Gentry became more and more mel
ancholy," said Mr. Williams, "until fin
ally a lot of old Whigs concluded to in
vite him to Knoxville to the house of
old Dr. Sandy Williams and have a
party of friends meet him there and
have a nice time and make him forget
his sorrows.
"In those days the gentlemen had
their long-necked demijohns with their
whisky, and these old Tennessee Whigs
drank until pretty late at night,. when
old Sandy said:
" 'Gentlemen, you know it Is the cus
tom of my house whenever there is &
minister of the gospel present to have
prayers before we retire. Brother
Brownlow (Parson Brownlow) will no'.v
lead us in prayer.'
"Brother Brownlow. -who was power
ful in prayer, expanded and expanded,
and began to pray for everything. At
last he said:

mercy it be possible, have mercy also
upon Andrew Johnson.'
"Then it was that Meredith P. Gen

tears streaming down hi3 face and ex
claimed:

WARRANTS OUT
FOR LOCAL MEN
United States Grand Jury Finds
Indictments Against Alleged
i'arncipants in Land Frauds
CONSPIRACY IS CHARGED
John A. Benson, F. A. Hyde and
Henry C. Dimoiid Are Among
Those Implicated in the Case
As a result of the investigation of
the alleged wholesale public land frauds
in many Western States, the Grand
Jury of the District of Columbia yes
terday reported a joint indictment for
conspiracy against John A. Benson, a
wealthy real estate operator of this
city; Frederick A. Hyde, a well-known
resident here and closely identified with
Benson in land affairs; Henry C. Di
inond of California, an attorney repre
senting Benfon and Hyde; and J. H.
Schneider of Tucson, Ariz., an agent ot
Benson and Hyde.
A telegram from Washington was to
the effect that bench warrants were is
sued immediately and Schneider was
arrested in Washington city late yes
terday afternoon by Secret Service
Agent William J. Burns, who has been
quietly investigating alleged public
land frauds in a number of Western
States. Schneider was taken before
Justice Barnard late yesterday after
noon and the latter fixed his bail at
$20,000. Attorneys Cole and Donnels
son, representing the defendants, asked
that bail be fixed at $5000. while the
Government insisted on a $25,000 bond.
Schneider has been a witness 'before
the Grand Jury in the case against the
other defendants. Benson already has
been indicted in Washington on a
charge of bribery and is now believed
to be in New York.
The indictment is a voluminous docu
ment and sets forth a number of trans
actions by which land is alleged to
have been fraudulently acquired from
the Government in this State, Oregon,
Washington, Nevada and elsewhere.
OTHERS ARE INVOLVED.
Most of these transactions are al
leged to have occurred under the lieu
land law. It is charged that all of the
indicted parties on December 30, 1901,
in Washington, conspired with other
parties to the Grand Jury unknown, to
defraud the United States of possession
of and title to numerous tracts of pub
lic lands of the United States and to
be opened to selection in lieu of lands
included or to be included within forest
reserves in various States, the con
ppiracy being carried out by means of
false and fraudulent practices.
The scheme outlined In the indict
ment and alleged to have been prac
ticed in these transactions was to ob
tain school or other lands by applica
tions, assignments and purchases. In
the names of fictitious persons or of
persons not really desiring or qualified
to purchase them, Hyde and Benson
paying them small sums for the lands.
The indictment charges that there
were false reports in all these transac
tions. In pursuance of this alleged
conspiracy, thus carried through by
dummy applicants, certain unsurveyed
tracts in the Olympla, Wash., land dis
trict, containing 3400 acres selected in
the name of C. W. Clarke, Frederick
A. Hyde and John A. Benson, were ob
tained and other lands specifically cited
were secured, including large tractB in
the Visalia and Vancouver land dis
tricts in Washington, in the Woodward
land district in Oklahoma, the Cascade
Range forest reserve country in Ore
gon, the San Francisco land district
and the Carson City, Nev., land dis
trict.
MORE ARRESTS TO BE MADE.
The arrest of the other parties in
dicted is expected very soon. The ac
tion taken disposes of all the land
fraud cases thus far presented to the
Grand Jury of the District of Colum
bia, but others may be submitted at
any time and proceedings are expected
in other Jurisdictions.
In speaking of the action of the
Grand Jury at Washington Mr. Hyde
said last night:
I have not tho ("lightest fear ot the ultimate
r<*Eult, and ffhail be prepared for the Issue
when it come*.
The Indictments were brought about by a
trick pla>Â«-d on Mr. Benson, which reflects no
credit on the Interior Department. He made
a visit lately to Washington and was ap-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, 'FEBRUARY 18. 1904
WILL DIVIDE
CLARK ESTATE
Beneficiary and Contestants of
Will of the Wealth! Suicide
Have Agreed on Compromise
EACH TO RECEIVE A THIRD
Probate Case Now in Courts
lla$ IJeen Peaceably Settled
Satisfactorily to Both Sides
The contestants In the matter of the
v.ili of Miss Isabella Clark, the wealthy
young woman who committed suicide
in the McNutt Hospital on September
10, 1003, have agreed on a compromise
and expect to have the contest settled
before the case comes up for hearing.
The Fisters, Alice Ann Hart and Mary
E. Carter, have been contesting the will
that Miss Clark made the day before
her death. It gave all of her estate
of $300,000 to her sister, Grace E. Strohn.
The case has been in court since Jan
uary 11 and the attorneys for the con
testants have endeavored to show that
Miss Clark was of unsound mind at
the time she made the will.
Several witnesses were examined and
they testified that Miss Clark's mind
had been impaired for some time just
prior to her death. Miss Clark was
Bent to McNutt's Hospital to b^treated
for nervous troubles and the Say be
fore she took her life she made her
will making her sister Grace Strohn
the sole beneficiary and naming Dr.
McNutt as executor. -
The will was filed for probate shortly
after Miss Clark's death and the two
overlooked sisters immediately filed
pnpers contesting the apportionment of
the estate.
The attorneys for the contestants. M.
F. Michaels and Carter Pomeroy, while
contesting the will, have been seeking 1
to effect a compromise. It was stated
yesterday on good authority that the
deal had been almost completed. The
compromise gives the contestants each
a third of the $300,000 estate. The con
testants claim that an even or prac
tically even distribution of the estate
will be made. They claim to be able
to get such a distribution by due pro
cess of law, as Mt has been almost
definitely established that Miss Clark's
mind was affected when she made the
will.
One of the contestants yesterday
said: "You can put it down as a fact
that a compromise will be made before
the case comes into the courts on Tues
day next. Just what portion of the
estate the contestants will receive I
cannot at this time say, but whatever
compromise is effected will be favor
able to the contestants."
Should there be a hitch in the corn
promise the case will be fought vig
orously.
It is claimed by the contestants that
the mind of Miss Isabella Clark had
not been in a sound condition from the
date of the death of her brother in
August of 1898 up to the time of her
death. Miss Clark was of an exceeding
ly morose and melancholy disposition,
and the loss of her brother, whom she
loved dearly, seemed to affect her mind.
Can Get No Damage*.
Robert GIbben is not entitled to any
damages as the result of injuries sus
tained by him while in the employ of
the Yellow Aster Mining Company, ac
cording to a decision rendered by the
Supreme Court yesterday. It is hold
that the plaintiff did not use proper
care and diligence at the time of the
accident.

proached by twer land office clerks, acting un
der orders from their superiors. These clerks
represented to Benson that they would for a
consideration jtlve him valuable Information
'about the reports filed by two special agents
who were out here investigating land matters,
lie declined to pay for the information, but I
understand that he gave one of them some
money In response to a hard luck story, and
he was Immediately arrested for bribery.
CONSPIRACY CHARGED.
The authorities must have known then, and
they certainly do now, that they could not
hold him on any such charge, and so they
have been casting about for some method in
its stead. To do eo they go back to a pur
chase of lands that I made in Oregon nearly
six years ago, which they allege was irregu
lar, and the claim is that I and Benson were
Jointly Interested in it and consequently ho
and I were In a conspiracy and this conspiracy
was continued in Washington by the so-called
bribery by Benson in 'Washingqton. .It is very
far fetched and the facts will be fhown at
the proper time. Benson had nothing what
ever to do with the Oregon purchases, and I
had nothing whatever to do with his dealings
with land office clerks. One of the clerks
(llarlan) 1 never heard of â did not even know
there was such a man in the office. The other
I had heard of by name only, but did not
know what he was doing In the office.
Colonel B. F. Allen Is accused of furnish
ing me with advance information relative to
proposed forest reserves, and no he did. He
was iiant to examine the country with a view
of recommending the lands to be included in
reserves, and his 1 express written Instructions
were to confer with all persons who could give
Information on the subject, and to publish his
Intentions in the county newspaper*. ThÂ« in
formation he gave me was wholly gratuitous,
and waÂ». strictly in uerformaace of his duty
under his instructions.
DENIES USING MONEY.
Any other perron could have had the same
Information, and undoubtedly did. I never
gave Mm a dollar nor asked an Improper
thing of him.
Henry P. Dlmond is a lawyer of Integrity,
and his only crime Is that he was my attor
ney for two years. He never knew anything
about the origin of my land titles, never ap
proached a clerk, except In a perfectly proper
manner, neither would he have done so under
any. circumstances. â¢
His Indictment Is an absurdity, and Is done
with thÂ» idea that he knows a good deal. that
he can be made to tell if pressure Is brought
on him. He will have no difficulty in clear
ing his name of any lmoutatlon . of wrong
doing.
Scnnelder was aji employe of mine years
ago, but for over two years has been In busi
ness for himself. ' His Indictment Is another
case of pressure, for he never had any -Inter
est In my business and could not be concerned
In any bribery. v â¢
The Government has no case , against any
one named in thÂ«s indictment^ and this will
be shown In good time.
COMPANY SUES
AT CITY'S COST
Spring Valley Official States
That People Must Pay for
Action Against Themselves
DODGES ALL QUESTIONS
Supervisors Find That Water
Company Charges All Ex
penses It Incurs to the People
The Board of Supervisors met last
night and proceeded as, a committee
of the whole to examine into the hold
ings, operating expenses and valua
tion of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, with a view to fixing the water
rate in San Francisco for the comlns
fiscal year.
â¢ Although the officials of the water
company promised last week to be
ready with the valuation of the com
pany's holdings last night, an account
was not forthcoming.
Attorneys Kellogg, chief lawyer for
the Spring Valley Company, said the
company would not have the report
on the valuation ready until next Fri
day night.
The evening was spent in an exam
ination into the operating expenses of
the company. Assistant Engineer Wll
lisms testified that the total expenses
of operating the water system for the
year, as estimated, would be $560,000.
Under a rigorous fire of questions
from Supervfsor Braunhart, who act
ed as examiner for the Supervisors'
committee, Williams itemized in a way
the expenses of operating the vari
ous pumping stations, reservoirs and
holdings of the plant. He said that
the Merced Lake pumping station used
$12,000 worth of fuel oil a year, and
the Belmont pumping station, he al
leged, burned oil each year to the value
of $20,000, the oil costing 71 cents a
barrel.
Williams said something in the
neighborhood of $30,000 was spent an
nually by the company in burning
grass and cleaning around its water
stations and reservoirs. /
PROPERTY NOT IX USE.
The Supervisors expressed amuse
ment at the statement of the company
that so much money is used in the
prevention of contamination, some ex
pressing the opinion that the quality
of the water didn't show it.
Engineer Williams testified that sev
eral of the pumping stations owned
by the Spring Valley are not In use
In the supplying of water to- the city.
Despite this fact the people of the city
are to be charged in the water rale
for parts of the water plant not now
In use.
According to the estimate testified
to by the officials of the Spring Val
ley, the sum of $52,000 was spent dur
ing the last year for repairs on mains
in the city. " r All of this amount, they
claimed, was spent in the replacing- of
small mains with larger pipe. Super
visor Braunhart thought this was an
exorbitant amount and requested
that the company be asked to prepare
an Itemized account of the manner in
which this sum was spent.
CITY PAYS FOR THE SUIT.
Under questioning, Secretary Ames
admitted that a portion of the $30,000
which appeared as legal expenses was
spent by the company in the prose
cution of its suit against the city and
county of San Francisco. The people,
he admitted, were expected to pay for
a suit against themselves. Of the
$30,000 in the legal expense account,
$8100 was paid in salaries, $7200 a
year to Chief Attorney Kellogg and
$900 a year to E. F. Fitzpatrick of
San Mateo County. The difference
between the salaries of the attorneys
for the company and the $30,000
amounts to $21,900. This amount of
money the Spring Valley failed to ac
count for and it was requested to" have
a detailed account ready at the next
meeting. It is suposedby the Super
visors that this $21,900 is to be spent
in the prosecution of the suit of the

disct-very by a local law firm of a de
fect In* the title to a large tract of
land known as the Coos Bay wagon
road lands, held by a corporation
known as the Southern Oregon Com
pany, has caused the filing of 200 ap
plications for quarter section* on that
tractÂ» which is one of the most valu
able pieces of timber lands In the
Northwest. It is claimed that this Im
mensely valuable tract of timber is held
ih trust by the Southern Oregon Com
pany for the people, the clause in the
original grant to the State of Oregon
from the Federal Government being
operative in which it recites that the
land shall not be sold . to individuals
other than citizens of the United States
and in tracts not larger than 160 acres
and at a price* not *o exceed 52 50 or
less than $1 20. This land has always
been held as a whole by the corpora
tion, and upon this point hinges the
fate of the 200 applicants to purchase
the land.
Intense excitement prevails as a re
sult of the disclosures regarding the
title. This company has persistently
refused to sell a foot of land to settlers
at any price.

Spring Valley Company against the
city of San Francisco.
The whole meeting and investiga
tion was prolific of little in the line of
information as to the operating ex
penses of the company. Expenses in
curred on holdings of. the Spring Val
ley that were not necessary and not
for the production of water for the
city were found all through the ex
pense account.
EXORBITANT CHARGES MADE.
In the report the city was charged
with the salaries of keepers and
watchmen of lands not in use In the
production of â¢ water for this city.
These salaries amounted to thousands.
Whenever a large item of expense
could not be understood by the com
mittee the water company officials
could not itemize it. They did not
know in what way the money was
spent, nor could they itemize the $14,
000 put down as stable expenses; the
$48,000 office expenses, or the general
expense fund of $20,000. Every ex
pense incurred in any manner by the
water company, whether in the pro
duction of water or not, was charged
to the city as Operating expenses.
There was a sum of $19,000 extra
expenses down in the expense report,
which the Spring Valley expected to
use in extra pumping in the anticipa
tion of a dry season this year. The
Supervisors thought that in view of
the fact that there had been a good
deal of rain subsequent to the mak
ing up of the expense account the
$19,000 mentioned could be eliminat
ed In considering the expenses of the
company.
As usual, the Spring Valley officials
were not ready with the reports that
the Supervisors wanted and what re
ports they did have were so skillfully
prepared that it was next to Impossi
ble to glean any information from
them.
The investigation was continued un
til next Tuesday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock.

TENNIS CRACKS
ENTER TOURNEY
Champion Players From Both
Sides of Bay AVill 3Ieet on
the East- Oakland Ourts
CLOSE GAMES EXPECTED
- â  â¦
Alameda County Clnbs Unite
to Hold Annual Champion
ship Tournaments, Open to All
The annual tennis tournaments foi 'â 
thr championship of Alameda County
are attracting more attention this year j
than ever before. This Is undoubtedly (
due to the fact that the tournaments
for the first tims will be open to non
i< siipnts of Alameda County. Many of
Che local players will avail themselves j
of the opportunity to wrest laurels from ,
the crack player* across the bay. The
California Club will send a small entry
list, but the Golden Gate Tennis Club
will bt represented by all its best play
ers.
The tnuraamfnty begin on Saturday
afternoon at 2 o'clock with the singles. ;
The doubles will commence Sunday !
morning, the first match being called \
at S:30. If possible both doubles and
tingles will be completed down to the
finals on Sunday. A record-breaking
*>rtry list is expected and hence it will |
hardly be possible to get further than !
tb<? semi-finals. The order of events
has not yet been arranged, but prob
ably the finals of the singles jrtU b'
played Monday morning: and the doub
les in the afternoon. Those who are
unable to ero*s the bay Saturday after
neon will not be defaulted.
Most of the class of events will un- â 
dcubtedly come from this side of the J
"bay. Percy Murdock is the only player ;
from Alameda County who ranks in :
the first class and the clubs across the
bay will pin their faith to him. The
California Club's strongest representa
tive will be Drummond MaoGavin. and
his chances of winning 1 are probably
the best. If Murdock were in practice
and at his best it wou'.d be a toss up
between him and MacGavin.
Will Allen is the next best player j
entered from this side of- the bay. In
doubles tbe California CIud will be rep- |
resented by MacGavin and Robert j
Variel. The latter is out of practice,
not having touched a racket for several I
months, but he and his partner will be j
one of the strongest teams.
.The Golden Gate Club has entered
the Baker brothers in the doubles, and
their chances of (sinning are good.
Their steady game is effective in tour
r.ament play. These two players, with
the Murdock brothers and Variel and
MacGavin. will be the best teams in
the doubles.
The Golden Gat" Club will have an
other good team in Carl Gardner and
< 'larence Griffin. George James and H.
Russell will also play. In singles the
oi.ly player from the park with any
â¢â nance is George Baker. Charles Dun
lap and Griffin ought to make a good
shewing, but can hardly hope to win.
That there will be new champions this
year is a certainty. Reuben Hunt, the
champion in singles, is in the East and
will not defend his title. Hunt ami
Percy Murdock are the doubles cham
pions. The winners of the events will
he the champions for the coming year.
The several clubs of Alameda County
have all got together for the first
time and the events will be held under
their joint auspices. The courts of the
East Oakland Club have been chosen
.on account of their location, number
and excellent condition. Two courts
will be used for singles and two for
doubles.
All matches except the finals will be
two sets out of three, finals three out
of five. Three-time silver cups will be
offered for both singles and doubles.
7*rizes will also be awarded to those
reaching the finals. Entries close Fri
day night and should be sent to R. B.
Heath, 59 East Eleventh street, Oak
land.

San Francisco's Star Jockey
Makes an Auspicious Debut
at the Los Angeles Track
WINNERS HARD TO PICK
Heir Apparent Beats a Field
of "Leppei$" and Sais Takes
the Handicap at a Mile
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17.â Jockey
Hildebrand, who has been the star
rider on the San Francisco tracks, ar
rived here this morning and out of
four mounts rode two winners at As
cot this afternoon. The track was very
heavy and picking winners proved
rather difficult for the talent, and two
out of six was the best it could . do.
Alma Dufour, at 3 to 1, took the first
race at five- furlongs from El^Bernardo,
with Dargin, the 4 to 5 favorite third.
The two-year-old race was an upset
for'the talent, Melar at 7 to 1, winning
handily from Sea Air, the favorite, with
Light of Day third.
Seven jumpers started in the hurdle
affair and Heir Apparent, at 10 to 1,
had the speed and won handily. Olin
thus was second and Goldone third.! ,
Sais, ridden by Redfern, was the first
favorite to get in first. He took the
fourth race from Grail,' with Warte
Nicht third.
The Goldfinder, Little Margaret and
Celebration finished in the order named
in the fifth race over the Slauson
course. ' The winner was a red-hot
favorite.
Florestan beat Louwelsea and Sherry
in the last event at one mile. Marta,
the heavily played favorite, was not in
the running.

plate stake, including Sacramento Boy,
Pocatelli, Palo Alto, , Mount Rose, Full

KENILWORTH, WITH SEE UP,
DOWNS MODICUM BY A NOSE
Five of First Choices
Meet Defeat at
Ingleside.
As his underpinning is becoming ' a
bit too creaky and uncertain to com
pete with the sprinters Kenilworth is
turning his attention toward picking
up some coin for Harry Stover in the
distance events. Only last Saturday
the brown horse finished third in the
Palace Hotel handicap, and at Ingle
side yesterday defeated Modicum a nose
for the ?1000 handicap at one and a six
teenth miles. Kenilworth carried 114
pounds, was extremely well rated out
in the lead by Willie See and lasted
just long enough to beat Modicum,
against which 20 to 1 was laid. Jockey
Club finished third, half a length be
fore Lord Melbourne. Proper, with his
heavy impost of 126 pounds, had first
call in the betting, but Martin got him
cut off at least three times going the
first half mile, and the big fellow cut
no figure at the close. -
The U-ack was \ slow, making fast
time aff impossibility, the one and t>.
sixteenth miles in 1:48U of Kenilworth
being a worthy . performance. Fine
weather attracted a large attendance.
Five favorites took the count.
A mile looked further than Charlie
McCafferty's Fair Lady Anna liked to
go, but such an ordinary bunch op
posed her that she was installed favor
ite for the first event. Jerry Roach
had the mount, and soon showing in
front with the first choice, won all the
.way. Johnny Daly on Polonius broke
a stirrup and then finished second, a
length ahead of Goldfinder. Glissando
and Anvil were both mildly ridden.
There were so many worshipers at
the shrine of Golden Idol that Dr.
Rowell's two-year-old closed a 2 to 1
favorite for the kindergarten event.
Despite the efforts of Johnny Daly, the
youngster ran out on the turn as usual,
finishing third. In a. hard drive, Jack
Martin, with the 15 to 1 shot, Steel
Wire, got on the inside, beating Bob
Ragon, the third choice, a head. My
Order, the 'second choice, stopped bad
ly the last part.
Harry Stover came very close to cap
turing the next prize for his three
year-old Hulford, only losing to George
Berry by a head. Hulford, which was
ridden by Travers, and 23 to 5 in the
betting, made all the running, but at
the end Jack Martin, astride Berry,
had the better of the saddle controver
sy, getting the decision. Instructor, at
one time looking dangerous, ruined his
chances by running out on the turn.
Flo Manola, the favorite, pulled up
very lame.
Billy Magrane's old horse Handpress
ran and acted like a two-year-old in
the Futurity course sprint, fifth to be
decided. Opening favorite at 9 to 5,
she floated to AW and, with Johnny
Daly up, was in the lead from start to
finish. Young Morello ran second, a
length in .advance of Hipponax, the 8
to 5 favorite guided by Bell.
Had the track been made to order it
could not have suited Hainault better,
and the brown gelding was plunged on
at short odds to win the last, a six
furlong selling affair. Johnny Daly,
who had the mount, raced out in front
with E. M. Brattain, although always
having a trifle up his sleeve. Strangely
enough,, though, Hainault quit the last
sixteenth, and Celebrant, coming from
third place, disposed of the gray
sprinter by a couple of lengths. The
winner had Bonner on his back. :
NOTES OF THE TKACK. S,
"Hello, Bell! Did you ring?" "Oh!
just rode Glissandro and Hipponax."
"That's good. Eh, eh. Yes, I under
stand. Well, ring up the Coroner's of
fice when you're not busy. Good-by."
Stuart could not stand for getting
away well very long. In the last race
he came close to being left with St.
Winnifride. The betting shows the
mare was backed back, from 7 to 12.
Track probably didn't suit Rustic
Girl. Or, perhaps, the route was too
far. .
.Wright, who rode Anvil, is not as
fast a rider as he was two months ago.
Flo Manola pulled up very lame.
She made a fine first choice.
Ed Stutte was not so far away when
he went across the board on Modicum
with his money.
Frank Doss is still endeavoring to
pick up a horse. He Jboosted Cele
brant from. $500 to $1800. but the
stable responded with the custo
mary $5. ]t'if
Barney Schreiber, fresh from the
land of the oranges and the tuber
culosis germ, cut in again yesterday.
He says the game at Los Angeles
shows signs of improvement. Consid
erable paper has been spi'inkled about
and the attendance is good.
Twenty-three books laid odds in the
ring yesterday.
His victory in the handicap made
the seventy-seventh race > won by
Kenilworth. Looks like Green Morris
got rid of. a gold brick when he sold
the brown horse some three years ago.
Ill-luck appears to hover over the
Derby candidates. Yesterday morning
Mendon threw his rider, and ran away
two and a half miles. On the back
stretch the three-year-old in some
manner managed to slide under the
bar at the gap and to all appearances
was none the worse for his jaunt.
After a two days' illness Paddock
Judge Jack v Dinue reported back on
duty yesterday. . <
The fifth race was a queer betting
race. Hipponax was at one time 7 to
5 and' "in.". Seven physicians were
called into consultation and pro
nounced Handpress dead. He won all
the way. Now looks as if consultation
was held over the wrong horse.

Tuesday evening and asked him to
marry them. Dunn asked the youns
lady how old she was and she said 17.
Upon being informed that she would
have to obtain the consent of her pa

she was IS. The marriage license
previously secured gave her age at ths
latter figure. In the face of her con

SAN JUAN, Porto- Rico, Feb. 17.â A
private message has been received here
from Santo Domingo City, dated Feb
ruary 17, saying that an American war
ship bombarded the Insurgents at Pa
jarito, near San Domingo, and then
landed marines. These men, however,
subsequently re-embarked.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 17.â The land
ing of marines at Pajarito, near San
Domingo, by an American warship no
doubt was authorized by the command
ing officer as a result of some menace
to American interests in that section
of the country. The cruiser Columbia
is now near Santo Domingo and the
marines landed presumably were from
that vessel. Her commanding officer
is Captain J. M. Miller. The unsettled
condition of affairs in Santo Domingo,
bordering in many places on anarchy,
has been a source of much .irritation
to the administration, and Admiral
Wise, the jenior naval officer in those
waters, has been given large discre
tionary powers to deal with the situ
ation.

STANFORD XIXE IS READY
FOR SANTA CLARA COLLEGE
Varsity Track Team Will Meet Ath
letes I'roni Pomona High School
Early in April.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 17.
â To-morrow afternoon the varsity
nine will play Its third game with the
Santa Clara College baseball team.
The game will be played on the var
sity diamond. Of the two previous
I contents Stanford won the first by the
score of 11 to 10 and Santa Clara the
second by the score of 8 to 4. On Sat
urday Cllf Ireland's 'Independents will
i meet the varsity nine on the Stanford
1 diamond.
Treasurer Cowden of the Associated
Students has completed arrangements
for a track meet between the Pomona
College athletes and the varsity team.
The meet will be held on the Stanford
track on the 5th or Cth of April, about
two weeks prior to the intercollegiate
[field day with Berkeley. Negotiations
I are also on foot to secure a meet with
1 Nevada.
Dr. Frank Angell, treasurer of the
Stanford Training House Corporation,
has made a report to the organization
showing that there is now more than
$6000 in the treasury as- a nucleus of
the fund with which to build Stan
ford's new training house and athletic
fields.
It is probable that work will be be
gun on the athletic field in the. near fu
ture in order that It may be completed
before 1905, when the intercollegiate
football game will be played on the
Stanford campus. Provision is to be
made for a gridiron, cinder path, base
ball diamond and other athletic fields
and also bleachers of sufficient capacity
to accommodate the football crowds.
It Is estimated that the .total outlay
will be more than $20,000.
Mrs. Stanford promised several years
ago to make a donation to' the training!
house fund when it should reach cer
tain proportion?, and it Is not unlikely
that she will double the amount now in
the treasury. If funds are not forth
coming from some source the larger
part of the cost of the athletio fields
will have to be met with borrowed
money. Donations from the alumni
are expected to swell the fund.
AGED HIBERNIAN COUPLE
MEET RUSSIAN VIXEN
Mrs. Elizabeth Pavuk Shows the O'Donnells : Phase
of Aggressive Warfare â A Chinatown Bum Claims His
Rights and a Number of Criminals Keep Judges Busy
Russia persists in her course of cruel
treatment to those of other nations.
The latest report of atrocities comes
from old Tar Flat, in the vicinity of
First and Jessie streets. The victims
are John and Mary O'Donnell, an aged
Irish couple, who told Judge Fritz of
the abuse accorded them by Mrs. Eliz
abeth Pavuk, a burly Russian woman,
who is their next door neighbor.
O'Donnell is S6 years old and he came
to the United States sixty-seven years
ffgo. His wife is 73 years of age. To
gether they came from New York to
San Francisco in 1849, and have since
been residents of this city. The old
man told a moving tale of abuse at
the hands of Mrs. Pavuk, and his wife
acted, as special counseland prompter.
"She came into my house," said
O'Donnell, "and threw cold water over
me, and me just getting over the long
pneumony. Then she took me black
thorn, the stick I cut with my own
hands when a boy, and broke it over
my shoulder. Then she grabbed the
stove lifter and hit me over the head
with it"
"Wirra, wirra," sobbed Mrs. O'Don
riell, "she hit my poor old man on the
head with a stove lifter and he bled
more than a quart."
"And she broke my blackthorn stick.
Judge," interrupted the old man.
Mrs. Pavuk denied these serions
charges in toto and with vehemence.
Judge Fritz set the case over until to
morrow so that he may investigate it
further.

G. J. Wilson was arrested Tuesday
night on Mission street because he
was chasing with a knife everybody
he met He had asked permission to
sleep on some canvas in front of a fur
niture store and when this was re
fused him he secured a knife and ran
amuck.
He was before Judge Mogan yes
terday charged with disturbing the
peace, and Just before his case was
to be called he threw a fit in the dock.
The other prisoners huddled up in the
corners in fear until the bailiffs
reached the writhing man and carried
him out of the courtroom. He was
taken to the Central Emergency Hos
pital and it is stated that he has re
covered sufficiently to undergo a hear
ing this morning.
Daniel McCarthy, a Chinatown
bum, created a diversion in the Po
lice Court yesterday. He claims to be
a gardener, but the arresting officer
testified that all the gardening Mc-
Carthy dtd was to irrigate his alimen
tiiry canal with noxious booze.
"He's a liar and a thief. Judge, yer
honor," shouted McCarthy. . "I have
as much right to be in Chinatown as
he has."
. He was warned' a number of times
to keep quiet and was finally convict
ed of vagrancy. To-day he will be
given a measurable term in the Coun
ty Jail, where a "grand old gardener"
is needed.
: George Lawrence, the "town con
stable" of Sutro Heights, who assault
ed a Chinatown guide on the public
highway while the guide was escort
ing a party of tourists around the
beach, came before Judge Mogan yes
terday for sentence. The Judge told
Lawrence that he would suspend sen
tence until April 15 and if at that time
the defendant could reconcile himself
to confine his efforts to preserve law
and order under the limitations im
posed by the city and county of San
Francisco the court would dismiss the
case.
James H. Sheehan, who arrived <n
this city yesterday from Alcatraz Isl
and, where, for larceny and desertion
committed in Manila, he had watched
for two years through iron bars the
ships of all nations sailing in and out
of the bay of San Francisco, was be
fore Judge Conlan yesterday on a
charge of robbery. Sheehan enjoyed
twelve hours of liberty and then
found an ex-soldier named Harry von
Leer. Together they went to the lat-

Stella Lester, who made Coroner
Leland seek the house tops of Paciilc

cape her affectionate but unwelcome
attentions, was given three months In

Mogan and now the Coroner walks the
streets without timidity.
Timothy Hall, a horseshoer, whose
wife is paralyzed and in the Almshouse
and whose eleven-year-old girl is at the
Children's Hospital, suffering from hip
disease, and to neither of whom he has
contributed a cent for more â  than a
year, was given thirty days In the
County Jail by Judge Mogan yester
day. The defendant promised that if a
light sentence were imposed he would
be enabled to sober up and then would
forsake drink and support his unfor
tunate family. The Judge told him
that if he did not keep his promise he
would give him a year on the next
complaint.

Mary Gaynor. who has come from
durance' vile within a week, was sent
back to the County Jail for three
months yesterday- by Judge Mogan.
She has a habit, after being released,
of invading the premises of those who
testified against her on her trial and
abusing them until the boards of the
floor begin to smoke and the paper
peels from the walls.
J. *S. Hester, who was arrested for
carrying concealed weapons Tuesday
night while appearing before the Police
Commissioners to make application for
a liquor license, was dismissed by
Judge Mogan yesterday. He comes
from Fresno, where there are so many
bad men that a "Gatling" is a necessity
as well as an ornament. He told the
Judge he was going to open a saloon in
the Western Addition, but he did not
Intend to open It with a revolver.'
The hearing of Mrs. Sarah Rdgers on
a charge of attempted subornation of
perjury was continued before Judge
Conlan yesterday. Marie Faulkener,
the complaining witness, finished her
testimony and H. A. Jaeger, a Ha
waiian, who lives at the California Ho
tel, and two other witnesses were
called to testify to collateral matters.
The hearing went over until to-mor
row.
Judge Fritz had as fine a bunch of
crooks before him yesterday as ever
climbed into a striped Jacket. They
were James, Gilligen, Henry Hamilton
and Thomas Murphy, and they were
accused of attempting to burglarize a
rooming-house on Ellis street. Hamil
ton and Murphy were found in the
house trying a door and Gilligen was
watching outside. The first two had
Jimmies and the marks of them were
found on the doors they were trying.
Gilligen killed a man at the Oakland
racetrack three years ago, but was un
expectedly acquitted. He is also said
to have aided in the escape of the Fol
,som convicts,. and while doing so was
shot by a member of one of the pursu
ing posse. He was unable to obtain
medical aid until after blood-poisoning
had set in and the leg was amputated
close to the trunk. The other two Have
served terms in the penitentiary.
When the prisoners went back to the
dock Hamilton managed to slip a note
to a friend, which was promptly
grabbed by one of the bailiffs. It was
as follows:
"Say my name is Harry Hamilton. If
I can plead guilty to a small charge I
can get a light sentence. Get me an
attorney. Let Monk or Bob Wall know
if only a few dollars."
Their further hearing was continued
until this morning.

MARINES GUARDING RAILWAY
AT ISTHMUS IN GOOD HEALTH
Captain Porter of Pacific Mail Company's Steamship City of
Panama Reports That of 1 400 iMen on Dutyv Ashore Only
Seven Have Contracted Fever, Which Formerly Affected Ail
The Pacific Mall Company's steam
ship City of Panama, Captain W. P.
S. Porter, arrived yesterday from Pan
ama and way ports. She brought TOO
tons of cargo, treasure valued at $25,000
and forty-two passengers. The cargo
included 1583 bags of coffee. The liner
encountered fine weather and reached
port c-n time. She was 22 days coming
from Panama.
Among the passengers was Ferdi
nand Servat, United States Consul at
Kcuador, who, with his wife, has come
home on a vacation. Sucn of the Pan
ama's passengers as crossed the isth
mus speak in glowing terms of the
splendid showing made by the United
States marines at present guarding th*-
Panama Railroad. Captain Porter says
that the sanitary problem of the isth
mus seems to- have been solved a3 far
as the marines' are concerned. Of the
1400 men on shore duty, only seven have
boen reported sick, and these are only
mildly affected with the low fevar from
which formerly few escaped.
There had been a striKe among the
dock laborers at San ' Jose, but the
Guatemala authorities regulated mat
ters by detailing a soldier to guard
each laborer and when the City of Pan
ama arrived there things were running
with some martial clatter, but
smoothly.
Passengers from New York say that
on the steamer City of Washington,
on which they traveled to Colon, flen
eral Silva Gondolphi, formerly Minis
ter of State of Venezuela, took pas
sage. The general was exiled to Paris
by the Blanco administration and is
going back, he says, to stir up x revo
lution. He claimed to have on board
the liner 8000 rifles, which he proposed
to land at Costa Rica and there equip
an army. Lieutenant Sweet of th>? navy
also traveled to Colon on t!u City ot
Washington. His mission w.i3 to equip
the warships on duty at the isthmus
with the Slavy-Arco system of wireless
telegraphy.
Mrs. M. G. Smith, wife of Captain
Smith of the bark Mauna A!a, which
was wrecked last July at Topo'.obampo,
returned on the Panama. Captain
Smith is still at Mazatlan, straighten
ing out the tangle resulting from the
wreck of his vessel.
The City of Panama's passengers in
cluded the following named: Ferdi
nand Servat and wife, Madeline Dii^
marest, Selina Holonquiest, Eugene
Tanke, Edmund M. Boothe, W. H.
O'Donnell, Marian Stephenson, H. S.
Avery, A. G. Stephens, Joseph J. Webb
and Mrs. M. Gertrude Smith.
The Southeaster's Harvest.
The recent southeaster, which brought the
rain that cheered the farmer, played havoc
with the eteam schooners engaged In the coast
trade. With the two vessels lost on Tuesday,
the record stands: Four schooners totally
wrecked, five coasters brought to port In dis
tress and minor damage to nearly every other
vessel that was out In the storm. ThÂ« first
vessel wrecked was the steam schooner Fulton,
which broke from her moorings ofC Port Orford
on February 12 and was destroyed on the
beach. Two days later the Alcalde was driven
ashore and wrecked at Grays Harbor. Then
on Tuesday came word of the loss of the Gem
at Nehalem and the Emma Utter at Barclay
Sound. The Empire came out of the blast with
a twisted rudder head: the Acme lost 40,000
feet of lumber from her decUload and was
rolled repeatedly on her beam ends; the Lee
lanaw'a pilot house was smashed in, part of
her rail carried away and other damage In
flicted: the Prentlss broke her rudder stock
and was piloted to port with the aid of Jury
steering gear; the Newsboy had part of her
deckload washed away.
Slaking Another Long Trip.
The French bark La BruyÂ«re Is out S3 days
from Port Los Angeles for Portland and the
underwriters Interested In her are worrying
about the risks they have on the vessel. The
British ship Thistlcbank. which arrived at
Portland yesterday, left Port Los Angeles two
weeks ago, more than a fortnight after the
French vessel palled. La Bruyere made a
very \ong passage from Cherbourg *> Port Los
Angeles and a high rate of reinsurance was
paid on her.i The fact that the .winds prevail
ing since the overdue bark left the southern
port have been favorable for fast sailing adds
to the anxiety for her safety.
Wyefleld Smashes Wharf.
The steam collier Wyefleld. which arrived
yesterday, 4Â»i days from Nanaimo. with 4931
tons of coal, crashed into Mission-street wharf
No. 2 when going alongside the coal bunkers.
She damaged the dock and caved in '.he walls
of an office on the wharf.' . :
The Overdue List.
The vessels on the overdue list were quoted
yesterday for reinsurance as follows: Theodor,
SO per. cent: Robert Rickmers, IB per- cent;
"W. F. : Babcock and. Bangalore, 20 per cent,
and General llelllnet* 10 per cent.

Donkey Was a Bad Actor.
Justice of the Peace Lanrson gave
judgment yesterday for $22 50 in favor
of George H. Davis, manager of th^
Central Theater, who sued Solomon
Barnett to recover money on c con
tract. The testimony showed that Da
vis bought some dogs and a % uonkey
from Barnett to be used in a road pro
duction of "Uncle Tom'3 Cabin." It
was agreed that Barnett was to buy
back the animals at the end ot the
season at 50 cents on the dollar. The
evidence disclosed that the donkey
was a bad actor, often refusing to jjr>
on in his scene and then eating the
green foliage of the scenery when he
was induced to appear before the foot
lights.
Raises Qnestion of Profits.
Charles F. Miller was arrested yes
terday on a warrant from Pollc*
Judge Fritz's court charging him with
obtaining money by false pretenses.
The complaining: witness is John
Lentz, 717 Howard street, who al
leges that on January 13 he paid Mil
ler S100 for a share in a business
known as the German English Rem
edy Company on Miller's representa
tion that the net profits' were from $50
to $)00 per month, but Lentz found
that the business was not yielding any
profit at all.
Talks on Ufe's Phenomena.
A very interesting lecture was given
at the First Unitarian Church last
night by Professor W. J. V. Oster
hout, who took as his subject "Some
Problems of Life Phenomena." ThÂ«
lecture was given under the auspices
of the Channing Auxiliary and at its
close the speaker was warmly con
gratulated for the able manner in
which he had handled his subject.

WAR, FIRE AND MONEY.
Hmj Wall Street Regards the
Current Sensations.
The New York circular of Henry Clews
r ay* :
"Wall street has proved its eounfln*sÂ» by
the su>ut resistence offered to a quick suc
<vÂ»s?ion of severe shocks, the like of whlrh
have not been previously experienced. ThÂ«
outbreak of war. the Baltimore fir* and the col
lapse in cotton speculation, to Bay nothing of
li^avy new railroad borrowings, combined to
put a strain upon the monetary situation that
would have wrought disaster had the financial
fabric disclosed any weak points of import
ance. The fact, however, that our market
yielded only a couple of points under such
an avalanche of unfavorable news and quick
ly reacted afterward is highly reassuring, and
<JÂ»n.ons;i.-itet anew the beneSclal ejects of
our heavy liquidation in 19U3. Had these ad
verse *lnn*r.t* happened a ypar apo they would
have rr^-cipitatwl a rar.ie. whereas now they
have but a transient effect and have afforded
a most satisfactory test.
"The war, of course, temporarily over
s-hadowi ail other influences. Thu* far none
â¢ f the world's money markets has seriously
!>H the war, the worst effect falling upon
Paris, where Russian bonds are largely held.
It has been estimated that France holds not
l*cs than $l,2OH,4kiu.O<JO of Rurslan bonds, so
that llusFla's char.ces of increasing her bor
rowlnt* from hf-r !>p?t friend on cood terms
are net very brilliant.
. FIRE AND COTTON MARKET.
"The Baltimore fire will not be a serious
stock tparket influence. The best estimates
are that the lossf-s to Insurance companies
will fall below $50,000,000. a considerable
ijortinn ct which must be paid by foreign com
panies. Tbese losses will, rnoreo%'Â«r, be paid
t.- ..: ::-.'.iy. in many cawn cut of surplus fun>1s
â  or by temporary loans. po that no great
craount of securities will be forced for sale
to ray losae?, which fall chiefly upon strong
companies efcle to meet all these obligations
without difficulty.
â¢"Another disturbing feature was the long
reared collapse of the speculation in cotton. Th*
Government report on cotton ginned. Issued on
Tuesday, proved conclusively that the bull
cnmr>a:Â£n on cotton had been conducted on
niistaken calculations as to the crop. Seme
of tbe bull leaoers had predicted a yield aa
low as fi.SufJ.OCO bales, while the Government
report hhowed fl,4b5.<s<X> commercial bales gin
ned MP to January 15, with a considerable por
tion of the crop yet to be heard from. This
information quickly destroyed the extreme
>iJort crop theories and frinas!}' imjiairfd, if
not ended, the bull campaign. In this quar
ter thrre has lyt-t.n no actual destruction of
property, but simply a Iosf of pai^r profits
and a more or less vio'.ent shifting of wealth
from cne claw of operators to another. Thus
far no serious troubles have followed the
break, which will be felt with most severity
<n ti?e South. *â¢ â¢
â  KAILROAD BORROWINGS.
â¢"There i* Jui=t one ether feature which in
Â£uces caution and that is the extraordinary
borrowings ot big railroad and other corpora
tions, chiefly tbe railroads. Within the last
few w*-ekÂ» over $2u0,OUO.W0 of notes, bonds
and other . obligations have been placed on
the market and more are likely to follow.
The treat bulk of those commitments axe of
a r.rtt-class character, but they are turning
floating ca;>itaJ Into fixed capital at a rate
ihat i? carried much farther will necessitate a
halt. Good investments will undoubtedly
crowd tboce of a lower grade, and this mass
< : r*-\Â» < reaxlooa will not be Jet- med a bull ar
f""Â»"'J particularly with thÂ« loan account of
the aesw>e;att-d banks star.dini above thÂ» 101)0
milltor. mark. No doubt much of the re
cistcnor shown by the market this week, was
owing to the support of powerful bankers, who
have undertaker: to float thf-iw new obliga
tions. Of course many of our railroad corpora
tions are dri\ - en to these enormous outlays
in ordt-r to mÂ«=*t urgent traffic demands, so
that the investments may be considered both
necessary and sound; still. If the eupply of
f-wh securities prove greater than demand,
values nvjst be expected to suffer accordingly.
"Mon^T still ar;*-ar5 to he f-asy, but it will
be prudi r.t to await the effects of all these un
usual demands, which will certainly interfere
vith anr extended bull campaign. Speculation
will have to wait until more necessary require
ments are satisfied. As said before, the situa
tion is sour.d an.i promising, but It Is. a good
time to move cautiously. The Northern Se
curities case is still hanging over -the mar- '
k*Â». and. though an unfavorable decision to
the conif.ary would cau*e no fur-pris*, it would
probably necessitate fome very extensive
Mil'ttnr of plans among thÂ« big owners of
reilrc*d properties/^
A Ne7V War Condition.
A new. war condition was cprang on the
w-wld yesterday. The dispatches announced
thit iS.OW Albeclaa troops, risen in rtvolt,
had *-ncountere<J and routed with great
.-iaurMer a body 'it .Turkish troops. This
ra'.ifd - general excitement en the Paris and
flu till bourses and on the London Stock Ex
Â«-hanÂ»re. English consols declined, Turkish
hoods were lower In all European markets and
Huiparian securities were unsalable. Russian
:FÂ«.jr-s declined *Â». but Japanese securities were
unchansed. American BtocV* were dull in
IÂ»r.(!on and Wall-street stoAs declined. . Cot
ton alor,e was firm. The record of this great
ptar.ls for a year past has been in direct op
iK-.yition to the course of all rpeculative mar
kets When rtoeks in Wall street were In
flated and booming cotton drac^d persistently
Jr.r a long time; now that Ftorks are low and
the world Â» fwcurities are weakening ell along
tbe Hoe cotton turns firm.

AVh; York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 17. â The frequenters of
th.e Stock Exchange changed their position In
the stock rcarket and sold stocks, in contrast
to the buying of yesterday. Or, rather, the
party which bought yesterday had not courage
to continue their operations, while their oppo
nents, who had Fold at the advance yesterday,
saw a profit in offering and proceeded accord
j lnsly. They had rather more success in main
1 tair.ing the declines to the end of the day than
! did the luills yesterday in holding the ad
] vancep. The extreme dullness of the market
! and th? poignant coinpiaints of all commifi
| slon houses of lack of cufficlent business to
! pay olfice expenses warrant the assumption
that operations are exclusively In professional
hards. While various nev.-s items of the day
are offered to explain the varying movement of
prices it Is clear that the movements represent
the. ideas of professional traders as to the
change tn values resulting: from occurrences
rather than actual transactions In liquidation
! or investment. Some effect on stocks wa?
1 fToducf-d by the whispers cent around that the
heavy drop in cotton and consequent specula
tive lofst-s were frolnff to result In financial
troubles. Th*-s<> rumors were without verifica
tion. The difficulties of gome of the insurance
companies involved in the Raltlmore fire
awaker.e attention to the possible aftermath of
that calamity. Germany contributed a story
that th<Â» Russian Government was taking a
tUil attitude toward the Uritish Government
rc-Rarding the expedition Into Thibet and for
eign stock markets seemed to be moved by
nÂ«*ns of an Albanian revolt. Whatever share
these various Incidents may have had in the
day's decline It was obvious that many oper
ators xvere prompted mainly by the considera
tion that yesterday's attempt to lift prices
had prave/S abortive, so that a movement down
ward wr.s most available.
The bond market was very dull and heavy.
Total sales, $1. 240, 000.

Available Grain Supply.
NEW YORK, Feb. 17. â In Bradstreet's
available supply of grain, issued yesterday,
tbe increase in wheat in the United- States
and Canada, east of the Rocky Mountains,
should have been 1,583,000 bushels, not 583,
000 bushels.
Chicago Board of Trade.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 17. â War complications in
Europe, as well as in Asia, whirled wheat up
2c a buihel to-day for May delivery. July
jumped 2%c. Compared with I last night's
prices. May wheat at the close showed a gain
of lV4@l%c. The net advance in July was
l%c. May corn is up %c, oats %@%c and pro
visions 10@27Â»'bc. ,
Wheat at the opening was about steady on
the comparatively firm tone of cables, foreign
markets showing no response to the decline
here yesterday. Initial sales of May were a
shade lower to a shade higher at 96V&C to 9<5%c,
while July was a shade lower to a shade
higher at 87%c to S7^c. Selling by the prin
cipal long, followed by profit-taking by smaller
holders, carried May down to 06c. July sold
off to 86%c. Toward the noon hour traders
were seized by an acute attack of war fever.
A report was circulated that an uprising had
occurred In the Balkans. From the moment
this announcement was made until the close
of the session there was an urgent demand
! for both May and July wheat. There was a
scramble among shorts to cover and the lead
(Ing bull houses bought freely.- The trade was
' of such large volume that individual transac-
I tlons were allowed to pass almost unnoticed.
The market turned suddenly strong and sharp
advances were made In all deliveries. An
other factor that helped to strengthen the situ
ation was a correction In Bradstreet's world's
visible eupply tlgures. . According to the re
vised data, the available stocks show a de-
I crease of "IS3,000 bushels, instead of an in
i crease of 217,000 . bushels, as announced yes
j. terday. The. export business was an additional
I bull factor. A report frcm Baltlmo're stated
that foreigners were taking all offerings in
the shape- of wheat, - while New York also

Â» Wheat and Other Graim.
WHEAT â Was firmer all over the world. Ru
mors on the European bourses that the Alba
nians and Turks had clashed and that the Al
banian troops had routed the Turks caused the
strength. -Broomhall cabled that war had be
gun" In' the Balkans and that' a conflict there
would render the Wheat situation acute, as 4t
would shut off exports' from Russia and the
Danublan countries, and a wild market would
probably result. The feeling everywhere r was
very sensitive and unsettled. â¢ Chicago de
clined from 87?hc to 8O74C rebounded to 89c

Hay and Feedstuff s.
All descriptions under this head continue
steady at previous quotations.
The circular of Somers & Co. says: -."I
"Shipments of Hay have been steadily de- I
dining for the last ten days, the total for the
week ending to-day amounting to 2000 tons, in
comparison with 2700 tons for last week and
3500 tons for the week preceding that. Ther*
seems to be a general disposition on the part
of most holders of Hay to string along their
I shipments so as to last them until the advent
I of the new crop. In the light of all reports
I this Is a very wise proceeding, for otherwise
at the rate Hay has been coming there would
be practically nothing left In the country by
the first of May. The almost continuous rain
for the past five or six days has interfered
very materially with trading in Hay, for, as la !
always tho case In bad weather, very little
Hay Is handled and every one buys from hand
to mouth only, preferring to await good weath
er before handling any great quantities. The
rain has not had the effect that many antici
pated, for. although trading has been light, no
apparent concessions have been made In prices.
We have contended right along that -the Hay
market was not a weather market except in
so far as a very high range of prices would
' have been seen soon had the rain not come.
1 There is no doubt that present stocks will be
1 entirely consumed when new Hay is ready for
! market, and if any new section commences to
draw from us there will again be considerable
excitement here. In this connection we have !
to report that it haa definitely been given out
I here that the Japanese Government haa been
1 making extensive purchases or both Barley and
OaU on this coast. Naturally they will have
to call on us for some hay, too. but as yet ;
no bids have been called for. Should they take
any considerable amount oft our market within
the next month or two prices will surely ad
vance.
"Priced continue at the quotations given dur
ing the last two. weeks, with trade light and
consignments firmly held."

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The market for table Potatoes was In good
shape under a continued steady demand and
ruled firm at previous prices. The best offer-
Ings of Oregon Burbanks are well cleaned out
of first hands and second quality offerings are
meeting with a fair demand. The report that
the steamer Q. W. Elder, scheduled to arriva
hew to-morrow, has broken down at Portland
and would not arrive before Tuesday Imparted
considerable firmness to the market. Garnet
Chiles were In good request for seed and small
Oregon Burbanks sold well for the same pur
pose at 80Â®00c per cental. Small lots of new
Potatots were received and choice offerings
were readily disposed of at 3@3%c per pound.
Onions ruled firm and dealers were anticipating
a higher range of prices. It was reported that
several, carloads of Nevadas were on the way 1
to this* market, purchased at $2 50 per cental,
f. o. b. shipping point.
Receipts of southern vegetables continued
light and previous prices ruled for most de

receipts and choice offerings of wrapped Toma
toes sold for shipping at an advance, but for
the ceneral run of supplies $1 25 was consid
ered an ' extreme figure. Asparagus from thf
river sold at COc per pound. I Receipts of Mush

character, with the cool weather operating
against the market. As It was, the demand
was confined almost entirely to the large
sizes of Navels but supplies of such fruit
were well up to' requirements and previous
prices ruled. Very little attention was mani
fested In the auction sale, as all dealer* were

EXCEEDS POWER
Oceanic Steamship Company
Sues to Determine Validity
of Tax on Aliens in Transit
DENIES COLLECTOR'S RIGHT
Avers He Has No Authority
to Collect Fee on Passengers
Who Do Not Remain Here
For the purpose of determining
â¢whether Frederick S. Stratton, Collec
tor of the Port of San Francisco, has
the right to levy a tax of J2 per head
on aliens in transit from Australian
or other antipodean ports to ports
in Europe, the Oceanic Steamship
Company yesterday brought suit to
recover from Stratton $428 paid by
it to the Collector as "head tax"
on 214 aliens brought to this country
from March to December, 1903. on the
steamers Sierra. Sonoma, Ventura and
Mariposa. The company contends that
Stratton acted without authority in de
manding from the company the tax
on aliens who landed here while en
route to ports across the Atlantic. The
point raised is a novel one. and if the
contention of the plaintiff is sustained
It means a saving of many hundreds
cf dollars annually. It will also great
ly reduce the receipts of the office of
the Collector of the Port.
The complaint of the steamship com
pany, which was filed by Attorneys
! Frank & Mansfield, appears to be sim
ply a demand for 5328 collected illegally
â¢by Stratton. It reads as follows:
Tfctt heretofore, to wit. between the 23d
4*v of March. 1903. and the 30th day of De
cfrntwr, lÂ»03, the said Oce&nic Steamship Cojn
jtry brought upon itÂ« f-aid steamers from port*
and places in Australia to the port of San
Francieeo two hundred and fourteen (214)
â¢Jlen passengers, who were then and there in
transit through the United States, and bound
for foreign ports, to wit. for the port* of
London. Bremen. Berlin. Liverpool. Vancouver,
Cla*Kow. Parts and Hamburg.
That notwithEtandir.s the eaid alien paÂ»
wnsrr* were in transit as aforesaid, the Baid
derendant as eueh Collector demanded of this
plaintiff the turn of two (2) dollars for each
and every paÂ»senjrer so in transit as aforesaid,
end then and there refused to allow entry of
1S - several vessels until euth duty of two <2)
dollars for each of eald passengers was paid.
That thereupon the said plaintiff duly pro
tested against the said exaction as being il
l<Â»cal. and because of the refusal of the said
defendant to permit the landing of such aliens
from raid vessels, and because of the Injury
to said plaintiff consequent thereon. stfid
plaintiff dtiK-Eited with th<; Collector of Cus
toms the said tax of two <2) dollars per head
upon each of Baid aliens, and then and there
notified eaid. defendant that it. the said plain
tiff, would sue to recover the same back, and
raid defendant then and there agreed that
Â«uch deposit should in nowise cr In any mat
ter vitiate, prevent or prejudice any action
et iaw or any rirht of a judicial character
which the said plaintiff might see proper to
commence, and said Collector received said
money â¢uhjfct to said protest, undersianains
and agreement.
That though often thereto demanded, the
said defenda.it has refused and still continues
to refuse to repey the Eame, or ar.y part
thereof to this plaintiff.
Wherefore, said plaintiff prays for judgment
â¢ rains; Â«aid Collector for the sum of four hun
dred and twenty-eirht (42?) dollars, together
with interest and t-osts.

ATTORNEYS TRY TO PROVE
LABROUSSE WAS DEMENTED
Slayer of Girl Hears Story of His Life From Childhood's
Days and Weeps When Counsel Tells of the Shooting
of Miss Jordanâ Witnesses Doubt Prisoner's Sanity
EDMOND DE L.ABROUSSE IN CHARACTERISTIC REMORSEFUL. AT
TITUDE AND SKETCHES OF SEVERAL. WITNESSES WHO GAVE
EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT'S INSANITY PLEA.
The prosecution closed its case yes
terday morning in the trial of Edmond
de Labrousse, charged with the mur
der of Miss Marie Jordan on September
29 last. Its concluding witness was
Mrs. Caroline Jordan, mother of the
murdered girl. She told how it was
that a trunk supposed to belong to the
prisoner was in her possession. She
said it was the property of her son
and had never belonged to De La
brousse. It had been lent him that he
might save storage charge when away
from the city and in it he had placed
his books and private papers.
Mrs. Jordan told of her late daughter
giving the jewels which accused had
presented her with back to him and of
his leaving them on the table, refusing
to take them.
District Attorney Byington then an
nounced that the case of the prosecu
tion rested and Attorney Roche began
his opening address to the Jury, detail
ing quickly, firmly and lucidly the
course he intended to pursue in the
defense of his client.
Mr. Roche admitted that he - appre
ciated the fact that the sanity or tem
perament of the defendant would be
subject to the closest scrutiny. He ex
pected to prove that not. only at the
moment of the homicide, but prior to
the commission of the deed Labrousse
was mentally deranged and could not
appreciate the crime charged against
him and was not therefore amenable
to the law.
FAMILY ifEETS MISFORTUNE.
Mr. Roche told the jury that De La
brousse, who was born in France, was
the son of Edmond Dufeu, who had
committed suicide when defendant was
but a child. His mother later married
Dr. Labrousse, a veterinary surgeon,
and her son took his stepfather's name
and grew up to love him as a father.
The family came out to San Fran
cisco and then removed to Nevada,
where in time defendant assisted the
doctor. Ill luck followed them and it
fell to the lot of young Labrousse to
maintain the family, which office fell
heavily upon his youthful shoulders.
Step by step Attorney Roche took the
court and Jury along the life-path of
De Labrousse. He told of his meeting
Miss Marie Jordan when both were em
ployed at the City of Paris' and of an
acquaintance which, said the attorney,
ripened into a love that was tender.
He told of De Labrousse's constant at
tendance at the French church and of
his endeavor to ,gain an education when
a boy to fit himself for' a position in
life, and also related , in detail the
young man's failures in business, when
he had hoped to build up a position that
would warrant him asking Miss Jordan
to become his wife.
De Labrousse, said Attorney Roche,
became estranged from his family "at
the time he was paying attention to
Miss Jordan. Mrs. de Labrousse wished
that her son should marry according
to her own manner of thinking and one
of his own religion. Then -Attorney
Roche said that Miss Lily Jordan, re
alizing that De Labrousse could not
make her sister happy, came between
the couple.

De Labrousse, . he said, could not
sleep when the estrangement came.
Miss Jordan put" him off and off, re
fused to talk to him, would not accom

weakened him mentally, said the attor
ney, months prior to the commission of
the murder, with the result that he
threatened more than once to take his
own life.

At this point of the address De Lr
brousse moved for the first tim* from
a leaning position, and applying his
handkerchief to his eyes, languidly
wiped away the falling tears."
Attorney Roche called a number of
witnesses in support of his statement
that De Labrousse prior to the murder
was not of sound mind. Michael J.
Hynes, Public Administrator, was the
first called by the defense. He
told 'of. his acquaintance with De La
brousse! whom he had known when he.
too, was employed at the City of Paris.
Hynes taid that he thought De La
brousse wes a very nervous man, and

THOUGHT HIM ERRATIC.
R. F. Oakley, salesman with Mur
phy, Grant & Co., told of De La
brousse's condition prior to the mur
der, saying that he seemed to him to
be a nervous wreck. Oakley thought
the man's mind was affected.
John O. Broden, employed by Wolf
& France, told how erratic De La
brousse seemed to him and of his look-
Ing into vacancy, and the Rev. Father
Robert F. Sesnon of the Church of tho
Star of the Sea told of visiting defend
ant in the Broadway Jail some six
weeks ago, when he found him to be Ir
rational, emotional and upset. Father
Sesnon said he tried to console him.
De Labrousse admitted that he was
very sorry for what had happened, was
profuse in his thanks for the visit and
wept. _V*?.
Henry Kugelberg, employed at Sam
uels' Lace House, had known De La
brousse some years. He said that two
"weeks prior to the murder De La
brousse wa"s dejected. He had always
given the witness the Impression that
he was erratic. When he worked with
him some years ago at O'Connor, Mof
fatt & Co.'s he was called "the crazy
Frenchman" by employes in the store,
riot that they thought him crazy, but on
account of his demonstrative manner.
Willatz Johannsen, Jean Baptiste
Contra-Barthe, Peter Roberts, J. Col
lins and J. G. Subra gave their opinions
as to the mental , condition of defend
ant, all agreeing, that he was strange
in his manner, while Subra said that
he was not only erratic, but that he
had made threats to commit suicide on
two occasions. Subra said that De
Labrouese was quick tempered.
Rudolph Ducharme and Edward D.
Mullaly, the defendant having lived at
the house of the latter, also . gave . it
as their opinion that De Labrousse
was r>ot mentally sound. ;,
The case will be resumed this . morn

THUG ATTACKS
SPEEPING GIRL
Bufflan Enters Room of Miss
Julia Henson at the Presidio
' and Tries to Strangle Her
ASSAILANT IS UNKNOWN
Culmination . of , Depredations
Which Have Baffled the Vigi
lance of Officers at the' Post
An attempt to strangle Miss Julia
Henson at the Presidio late Tuesday
night seems to be the culmination of
thieving that has been carried on in
the post for several days.
Although officers, non-commissioned
men and sentries have .been on the
alert to catch the midnight marauder,
they have failed to locate him, and
in the midst of the populated canton
ment of the Tenth Infantry and while
the sentries -were on duty a villain
eluded their watchful eyes and with
murderous intent crawled in through
an open window and approached the
bedside of his intended victim, grabbed
her. hands and then tried to choke her
to death. The story is bast told by
Miss Henson herself, who stated:
"With several other or tne girls who
are in attendance on the officers' mess,
I occupy qne of the rooms which were
formerly the old clubhouse. I retired
early Tuesday night. Shortly before
midnight I was awakened bPsome one
grabbing my hands in a firm grip.
TRIKS TO CHOKE HER.
"Before I could scream his hand was
on- my throat. I succeeded in getting
my left hand loose and struck the thin
â¢ board fartition wall between my room
and the next a blow that awakened
the other girls, anfl one of them spoke
to me. With that the ruffian slightly
relaxed his hold, and I screamed and
shouted for the sentry.
''Even then the fiend still tried to
choke me, and it was not until one of
, the other girls commenced to scream
that he let go of me and dashed from
the room, through an adjoining unoc
j cupied room, and leaped through the
j window and disappeared in the dark
| ness of the night. In the meantime
j the other girls were up and, hearing
the crash of the fairing window, by the
dim light of the camp they could see a
stalwart man run off into the trees
back of the camp. Just at this point
the colored cooks appeared, with sen
tries with lanterns, and thoroughly
Eearched the place. I was so terrorized
j that I did not know what to do.
! GIRLS SHRIEK WITH FEAR.
Â« "Some of the other girls were so
I frightened at the rumpus that they
I shrieked with fear and covered up
; their heads with their bedclothes and
1 refused to move until the whole house
I was lighted up and had been .searched
1 by the guards from one end to the
! other. I left a small amount of money
' and my rings and jewelry on a table at
; the foot of my bed, and the girls in the
: other rooms all had small sums lying
! about, and some of them had put their
watches on their dressing tables. None
of these things were missing. We were
I all so frightened that we sat up till
I morning, fearing another attack, and a
sentry. stood guard all night in front of
the house."
Miss Henson is a modest appearing
i girl of perhaps 19 years of age, :
1 and is much upset over the attack. She
has been employed at the Presidio for
a year in her present position.
Colonel Noble Is at a loss to under- |
stand liow the depredations have been I
going on, but thinks it must be some
discharged soldier or one of the numer
ous camp followers who hang around
the gates of the post. The attempted
strangulation puzzles him and he does
not know what to think of the pro
ceedings. . He, however, states that any
prowler seen or caught about the camp*
hereafter will come there at his own
peril.

OWNER IS SUED
David Jacks arid Pacific Im
provement ; Company Are
Charged With a- Land Fraud
GORE WANTS" THE RANCH
Alleges That the Government
Patent Was Obtained by
Inadvertence and Mistake
Suit was filed yesterday in the United
States Circuit Court by John C. Gore
Jr. and Hamilton Gay Howard against
the United States of America, David
Jacks and the. Pacific Improvement
Company to quiet title to the Rancho
el Pescadero, in Monterey. County.
The complaint alleges that the.prop
erty was erroneously patented by the
United States to David Jacks on Feb
ruary 19, 1868, and that .J. C. Gore Jr.
has been â¢ defrai&Ied out of the 1 prop
erty. It is set forth that Gore Jr. filed
suit against Jacks in the United States
Circuit Court in 1S69 over the same
piece of property and that Gore lost
the suft by reason of the statute of
limitations. But in the present suit
Gore urges that the patent had not
been pleaded by Jacks; that its valid
ity had not in any manner, been ques
tioned; that Gore was ignorant of its
existence until the bringing of the pres
ent suit, and that the patent was not
recorded until July 30, 1880, when the
Pacific Improvement Company had It
placed upon the records.
It is alleged that ,on February 4, 1862,
Jbhn C- Gore conveyed the property
to his son, John C. Gore Jr.,' who gave
his power of attorney to Frederick Z.
Seymour of Boston, who in turn con
veyed it to Edward Tcrrhpkihs of Blng
hamton, N. Y., in exchange for some
of Tompkins' property in that place
alleged to be much inferior in value
and heavily incumb'ered. It is alleged
also that on April 9,. 1862, David Jacks
got a quit claim deed from Tompkins
for a stated consideration of $10,000.
It is- further alleged that Edward
Tompkins, Frederick Z. Seymour, D.
R. Ashley, B. â  F.'-Ankeny. and "David
Jacks were conspirators and succes
sively engaged in an attempt to de
fraud Gore Jr. of the patent; that Jacks
had always intended to criminally get
possession of the ranch and to defraud
the United States and to cause the
United States to issue letters patent
for' the ranch to v him instead of to
Gore or his son Gore Jr.. and that the
Pacific Improvement Company was
cognizant of Jacks' illegal title at the
time of the purchase. Of the persons
mentioned as conspirators Jacks is said
to be the only one remaining alive.
I It is further stated that the property
takes in part o'f the Seventeen Mile
drive in Monterey County; that it is
of the value of half a million dollars,
and that the patent was Issued througrf
the inadvertence and mistake of the
United States officials.

' Judge dc Haven Decides That She

i United States District Judge de
Haven yesterday dismissed the libel
for salvage on the launch Famiglia
Unita, rescued from the breakers on
the ocean beach a mile and a half
south of ,the Cliff House on December
22 by Frances Hanique, a middle-aged
' woman, who rushed barefooted Into
! the surf and hauled the launch ashore.
' The following is the decision:
"I think the evidence given by the
libelant is substantially true, but in my
opinion it does not show that she res
cued the Famiglia Unita from any
peril. Indeed, I do not think that
what was done by the libelant ma
terially aided the launch in reaching
the shore. It is clear that what was
done by the libelant does not consti
tute a salvage service in any sense.
