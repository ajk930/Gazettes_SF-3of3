'^The\ police iatate: that the cases of

culiar, circumstances in San Francisco on
August 15 at a lodging-house at 329 Minna

the .two men 'â¢ were' constantly -together.
On the day of \u25a0 Powell's death, however.
Regal disappeared^ Chemists who exam
ined the contents of Powell's stomach
stated that .death was caused by carbolic
acid poisoning/- ;,The day before his 'death'
Powell had j complained Ito the landlord
that Regal :had robbed : him of money and
jewelry. : He", also : stated that Regal j had
forced him to drink of an ill-tasting wine,
though Regal himself, had refused to im
bibe. No traces of poison .were found in
the wine that remained in the decanter.
A" search was, made for Regal, as the
police believed ; that â¢he could throw light
upon Powell's death. "By Regal's suicide
the mystery is deepened and may never
be cleared , up./ The police believe \u25a0. that
Regal * took his life \ for one of two rea

of Powell's death or carried out a suicide
agreement. ' i, i
INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 27.â A. F. Nor
ton, the Marion grocer, who obtained the
dlnlng-hall privileges at the Wesleyan
conference meeting in Falrmount, to con
duct the business "as Christ : would run
it," has found the project vexatious and
unprofitable, and has abandoned it.
Mr. Norton, is known throughout the
State as the man who "runs his business
as Christ would." and In the grocery busi
ness he ; has' been very successful. He
started a store several years ago, sold
goods for" cash- only, refused to - deliver
to the homes of customers, paid his em
ployes every .night . and cut prices on
everything . he handled. He was bo suc
cessful :' that . he opened another grocery
on the same plan and this was followed in
less than a year by another, making
three under his management and all do
ing a good, business. .;.
Just before the Wesleyan annual meet
ing began .Norton , was. granted ..the .priv
ileges . for the dlnlr.g-hall, and opened the
place four days s ago. ; He. refused to make
.any,, charge /for meals Â£ervcd;lbut lÂ»f t; it

servedâ and ; after -the first day. it began
to show the result of wear. Persons who
patronized the hall complained more. of
the tinware than of; the meals. Clergy
men in. attendance at the;- conference
were among those who registered â¢ the
loudest and longest complaints, the most
grievous thing of which they complained
being the absence of fried chicken.
Many of Norton's boarders withdrew
to the hotels, and yesterday he closed the
hall, dismissed the waiters and cooks
and retired from the task of running a
restaurant "as Christ would."

As the strike extended, it became
more vicious. When the railroads had
succeeded in moving trains in spite of
all Debs could do, be became desperate.
Then rioting was begun in the freight
yards. This bred new disorder and the
torch came into use. Some one set fire
to a few freight cars and they were de
stroyed. The whole freight yards were
set ablaze within a week.
The road sued for $140,000. The jur
ors decided that $40,000 -was represent
ed by merchandise in transit and the
city should not be held responsible for
this. But they held that the city could
not escape financial liability for fail
ure of the authorities to curb mobs and
prevent the burning of cars.
It was the contention of the city that
the cars were not burned by mobs.
The city has been fighting these
claims for ten years.
The Panhandle trial has been on

CHICAGO. Aug. 27.â Chicago has
reaped a harvest of the whirlwind of
Debs* American Railway Union strike
of 1694. A Jury in Judge Frost's court
In Wheaton yesterday brought in a
verdict for $100,000 against the city in
favor of the Panhandle railroad. This
amount represented, in the opinion of
the jurors, the damage done to the road
by the burning of Its freight cars in
the strike riots.

For the last four years she had been-aj
notary public. She was 'a graduate roJ*tnÂ»"
Polytechnic High School In San*Francls

mother and father. Only six months ago
she.' purchased the house in which* sha
died. . - -Â«VÂ£ \u25a0\u25a0Â£â¢"
The young husband was frantic with
grief when he realized that his bride had
been snatched from his arms by the hand
of death, and could give no coherent ac
count of the accident. Bending over the
still form, which the Coroner had not re
moved from the house, he begged for a
word of farewell. When Mrs. Bradford,
the mother of the young wife, attempted
to lead him from the room he refused to
go, and for a time It was feared that his
grief would dethrone his reason.
The victim of the fatal mistake was a
native of Modesto, and besides her hus
band, father and mother, she leaves- one
brother, I* H. Bradford. Her parents
have recently moved to this city â¢ from
San Francisco and now reside at CD Six
ty-fifth street.
I The Coroner has taken charge of the'
case, but- owing to the circumstances of
Mrs. Sullivan's death the remains were
not removed to the Morgue.' An inquest

the arms of her husband, to whom' sha
had been .married for less than a year.
The husband and wife, in company with
Miss Jeanette Grau.of San Francisco,
were at the dinner table when suddenly
Mrs. Sullivan, who had been complaining
all day of a terrible headache, rose from
the table and went to a medicine closet in
the room, saying that she must take
something to stop the pain or she would
go mad.
' Miss Grau and the husband saw her
take a bottle from the closet and put it
to her lips, and a moment later she
turned with a scream aa the lysol, which
is a powerful disinfectant, , burned her
mouth and : throat. Sullivan sprang to
ward his wife as she ran to the sink, and
as she expectorated the fiery fluid from
her .mouth some of it fell on his left
cheek and eyelid. and narrowly missed de
stroying the sight of the eye. .. ' ..
As soon as he saw what, it was that his
wife., had I. taken Sullivan . hurried to ' the
office of Dr.'A. S.. Kelly, at 457? .Telegraph
avenue,* and told "him what his wifeTigcJ
dose. Dr.'Kelly hastened: to the, Sullivan
home, but by the time he reached the
house- Mrs. l Sullivan .was insensible and
shortly afterward she died, without hav

said that he had '.become convinced that

affairs '.at Havana : and \u25a0 throughout Cuba,
an epidemic -of yellow . fever . swept
through ;the West;,lldies and medical
authorities seemed unable to cope with
-it- Thousands of deaths occurred and
the stricken people waited \ patiently for
the" cold weather- â¢â¢ to come \u25a0 that the.
scourge might .be abated.' -
At that time there was attached to the
Medical Corps of the United States Army
'a/volunteer surpeon named W. li. Reed,
â¢a resident of -Baltimore. Doctor Reed:
was young, and an /ardent lpver^of "his
chosen 'profession. He decided to; make
a study, not of theÂ»cure of. yellow fever.,
but bf Its cause. \u25a0 .He saw that it was
impossible to; stem thd "tide 1 of yellow,

ciired''a -laboratory, and -commenced his
studies and tried experiment after ex

will mark the beginning of the fifth week
ot the Taggart divorce case, and It Is but
truth to say that many of the residents
of this quiet little city have jus* awak-.
ened to the real Importance of the trial
that has been going on for four weeks.
Though all have been interested, yet
the statement of Judge Eason as to the
welfare of the ' two ' boys being' above tho
granting of a divorce to the parents, and
scandals and dissipations at. army posts.'
seems to have aroused "a deeper Interest
in the outcome of the trial among tha
townspeople. " ': - >
Opinions are divided as to what has
been shown and what will be the find
ing of the court, yet it is , a fact . that.,
contrary to the rule, the greater number'
of the" fair ~sex^believe that Mrs. Tigsart '
will be \u25a0' the 'winner. â¢ â¢\u25a0 "
Mrs. - Taggart 13 very hopeful and con
fident of the end. and in a statement â¢
this evening said: "
"It does not seem 'possible that Judge.
Eason could take my boys from' me.' "l
have felt from the start of the case that
no matter what Captain Taggart and his
witnesses might swear to that I would
triumph in the end, for, as God Is' my
Judge, â¢'! am- not- guilty -of the cruel
charges he has made against me. and as
I believe the testimony shows. Only a
mother known what I suffered in -the- long
months â¢ that nave gone whea I thought
there was even a possibility' of my' boys
being taken from me. Oh. 'no. it will 'not
be. and they will be given to me to rear
and bring up as men to raise children of
their own. but to never cause their wives
the anguish and the heartaches their
father brought to thefr mother." '
Captain Taggart and his counsel ara
equally confident of winning.'

NEWBURX. N. C. ' Aug. 27.â John.
Moore, a negro. 20 years of age, was
taken frOm the Craven County jail in
this city early to-day and lynched by a
mob of 100 masked men armed with
rifles and revolvers. With his bands
tied behind him the negro was led.
about. a third of a .mile from the jail
to the draw of Neuse River bridge,
hanged to one of Us bra.ces. and his
body riddled with bullets. The mob at
tacked tho jail between 1 and.J o'clock
this tnoniine- ..Entrance u> the. jail was
effected by forcing the jailer to. sur
render the keys. .As jsoon qs, the at
tack was discovered the naval reserves
werÂ«Â» ca!lcd out to attempt to prevent
the lynching*. Crowds rushed to tne
bridge. Sheriff J. U\ Biddle was quick
ly on the scene pleading that Moore be
left to the law, but his efforts were
unavailing and the mob carried out its
plans. ' â¢
Moore entered the country store of'
George Eubanks at Claris, seven miles
from NewÃnrn, last Friday when the
proprietor's wife was alone in the store.
The negro attempted robbery j and
struck Mrs. Eubanks on the head with
a meat ax. fracturing bones and in
liictlr.g serious injuries. Mrs. Eubanks
screamed and people camo to her* res
cue. The tregro fled, bat was captured
In a swamp after a chase of a few miles
and was placed in Jail.
CHARLOTTE. N. C. Aug. 27.â A spe
cial, from Newburn says that the real :
cause of the lynching lay in the fact â¢
that at his preliminary hearing yester-' â¢
day. Moore's bond was fixed at the
small sum of $300. The lynching was !
denounced from all the -pulpits of the;
town this morning. i

dered all steam shovel. work discontin

"We shall have no difficulty in get

superintendent, who has charge of that
branch of the work has worked 75,000
men on a single contract, and he says
he could g*t IOD.OOO blacks for work
on the canal, if so many were needed.
The principal idea at present is to^ pro
vide quarters for the employes, to es
ui-tish good sanitary conditions and
to arrange for the prompt payment of
the men. Once these preliminaries are,

POSITIONS OF. THE ARMIES.
The interview between Mr. de Witte and
Mr. Takahira was the sensation of the
day. Everybody had been at high ten
sion. On all sides the report had been
spread that to-morrow, would witness- the
final break-up and that to r morrow night
the hotel would be deserted. The Russian
attache-?, who know Mr. de Witte's posi

dates of the steamship sailings, etc. Then
suddenly, at 9 o'clock, the rumor got
abroad that Mr. de Witte and Mr. Taka

PORTSMOUTH. N. H.. Aug. 27,â The
life cf the peace conference to-day seems
to hacg by a thread, but the thread will
not be broken to-morrow. At 10 o'clock
to-night, after an hour's conference be
tween Mr. Takahira and Mr. de^Witte,
in the latter' s room in the hotel "annex,
the announcement of a postponement
was made. Mr. de Witte explained after
vard that Mr. Takahira had told him
that no new instructions hid reached
him from Tokio, and, fearing none might
be received before the meeting scheduled
for to-morrow afternoon, Mr. Takahira
had suggested the propriety of postpon
ing the meeting until Tuesday.. To this,
Mr. de Witte said, he had readily assent
ed. Mr. Takahira made the following
t-tatement to the press:
"Inasmuch as this conference was ini
tiated by the friendly office of your
President, after consultation, we felt
that we should be cautious about termi
nating its labors."
Pressed as to whether he regarded the
eituation as hopeless. Mr. Takahira said:
"No, not hopeless, but almost hopeless."
This, in Itself, from one who has spoken
always in the most .guarded fashion, is
sufficient to show the desperateness of
thÂ£ situation. The real crisis in the ne
gotiations is at hand. It is very acute,
*nn if it can be tided over a few days.
a ruptnre, a basis of peace ac
ceptable to both sides may come very
suddenly.
XOW IT IS "IP" TO JAPAN.
But. to save the situation now. Japan
must speak. If on Tuesday she has noth
fng' to offer all is over.
Mr. de Witte, even If he vrould, is pow
'\u25a0ci less to take a new step. His hands are
tied. He now occupies the role of an im
r* rial messenger, who transmits his mas
ter's orders to Baron Komura and Baron
Kosiura turns them over to Tokio for
the response. The conference room has
ceased to be a place for negotiations. It
is fcimply the place where the Emperors
of the warring countries exchange their
communications by the hands of the en
voys.
And upon the principle of indemnity, or
reimbursement for. "frais de guerre." un
der any disguise. Emperor Nicholas has
g:ven the Japanese Emperor hl Â»- last
t ord. Mr. de Witte accepts It as final,
and in writing yesterday Informed the
' Japanese plenipotentiaries that Russia
v.ould have nothing further to say upon
this subject. .Russia would cede one- half
of Saghalien and pay the cost of the
maintenance of the Russian prisoners,
but that was all. Emperor Nicholas had
given the same response to the President
tnrough Embassador Meyer. ,
The Russians generally seem not dis-
Pleaeed with the situation. They believe |
Jj.pau has . been diplomatically maneu
vered into a corner from which, if she
now persists in her attempt to exact
tribute with the alternative of a continu
ance of the war. she cannot extricate
herself before the public" opinion of the
world.
JAPANESE ENVOYS WORRIED. ,
Japan here and in Europe, they say.
eppealed for sympathy on the ground
tii|t Russia had compelled her to take
uAjrms to protect her life. The fortune
or war had gone in her favor, and Rus
s.a. recognizing that she had been beaten
and preferring peace to the continuation
of the war. had ajsreed to cede on every

hag and baggage, and to commit herself
to the recognStion of China's integrity
and the policy of the "open door." But
. Japan, insrstlng upon tribute, because
Kussia refused, prolongs the carnage. In
that act, they contend, Japan would
change the purpose and character of the
war. which would cease to be one of prin
ciple and degenerate into a war for the
exaction of money.
There is no doubt that the Japanese are
-worried over this aspect of the stiuation,
and they do not propose to be placed in
tliif position if it can be helped.
With the sentiment existing in Japan
demanding reimbursement for the ei
rÂ«Â»nses of the war, a money payment be
y.jnd what would be obtained for the
. Jnaintenance of Russian prisoners and the
Chinese Eastern Railroad could not be
foregone. But If redemption ' by Russia
could be placed upon purely a commer
cial basis Russia might agree to it. Logic
points in this direction, for the ultimate
compromise, if there is to be one.
PRESIDENTS EFFORTS BALKED.
Whether the President has renewed his
efforts cannot be ascertained here. His
former suggestion' for a compromise
failed. He made his appeal simultan
eously to both the Czar and the Emperor
of Japan. He proposed the "indemnlty-
Baphallen" combination, but not In the
form in which It was presented by Baron
Kornura at Wednesday's meeting. In
Â«=e?j of settfng the price {1.200.000.000 yen,
tTÃjrestimated cost of the war) he sug
gested that. If an agreement could not
be reached, the fixing of the price should
be left 'to a board or commission. The
Japanese Insisted on inserting the sum
and thus made It Impossible, in view
of the Russian declaration, not to ac
~pt It. Emperor Nicholas refused to go

I .ST., PETERSBURG. Aug. 27.â There is
a great Increase in the agrarian agitation

in the Caucasus, where 'there ' have been
serious disturbances. In \ the. Gori district
the 'peasants "are forcing the nobles, un

the newspapers that they are handing
over. their holdings to the peasants freely,
or are accepting. one- tenth instead of one
quarter of the crop yield.
The refusal' of the peasants in the'vil
lage',-, of X "to pay ' Prince
lnukshansky the proportion of the crop
to v which he' was entitled led- to a serious
conflict between the peasants and Cos
sacks. The Cossacks fired on the peas
ants, killing or wounding.' according to
an' official account, nineteen, .and' accord-
Ing to unofficial account seventy. Peas
ants-from the mountains came to the as
sistance of 'the villagers, with the result
that there" were, fresh conflicts, in which
one Cossack . was killed. Prince lnuk

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Aug. 27.
. With -the return ot, the majority of tho
students,' to Stanford; the absence of the
| customary "rushing", among ) the soro
rities has caused, much, comment in uni
versity society. TluVsfatÂ£ of affairs is'
not limited to a few of the organizations
but Is the policy being followed by all
the societies composed of young women
upon the campus. â¢ â¢
'.The cause for the action of the co-ed 3
is due to an agreement which all the
secret societies have Indorsed. , This
agreement was signed by the sororities
last spring as the only-alternative offered
them by the committee on student af
fairs, which disapproved of the extent to
.which, the younar ladies had carried the
system of obtaining desirable Intrants for
their societies, v- Â» >J
The most important.' restrictions la!d
upon the sororities in the agreement were
those . which forbid any entertaining of
freshman friends at the society " houses
between the hours of 9 a. m. and* 4 p. in.,
also that no young men are to be present
at any social function given by the soro
rites. This latter restriction was made t->
prevent . "rushed" members from belnsr
in any way influenced by any possible
attraction in this direction. _TVT V
The agreement Includes a restriction
which has been in force in former year*.
namely, that no entering co-eds shall bÂ«
pledged to any society until at least *tx
weeks after registration. These resolu
tions have been duly signed by thÂ» six
sororities and it is now a question
whether they .will prove effective.
That the section . south of Oakland is
growing rapidly is shown by the lively
little town of Haywards. ' Assessor Reese
has raised the . valuations inside of the
town limits $135,865." -.;
This Spirit of progress j&nd annexation
was-; shown on Tuesday * last when the
Oakland City Council finally, granted . the
Oakland Traction Company the necessary
franchises that will enable it to complete
Its lines to Frultvale. The Fruitvale
Board of Trade sent three Targe automo
bile loads of boomers to Oakland with a
brass band, which paraded about Oakland
boosting and booming: their section. The
officers and members of the Board of
S Trt.de committee In charge of Ithe cele
bration were: President, A. â¢ Lorebach;
vice president, W. T. Gruob; secretary,
.Dr. J. H. Callen, and John A. Sanborn,
Henry Barkmeyer, Alfred. .Robinson, E.
"1L , Marwedel, W. S. , Dunlevy, C. A;
. Armstrong-, M. C. Gibson.'. H.~- A. . Pleitnerj
"W.- B. Rudell and John .' Auseon.
There Is to be a great deal of develop
ment in Fruitvale in the near future, and
the residents of this seciion will see
whether they cannot annex themselves
to Oakland and get the benefits of mu
nicipal improvements, such as street
lights, flre and police protection. This
Eection is really part of Oakland, as far
as geographical boundaries go, and It is
already so well built up that city gov
ernment has become a necessity. ThÂ«
people are believed to favor annexation,
for fome months ago a proposition to in
corporate the district as a separate city
\u25a0was beaten by a vote of four to one. A
petition for annexation to Oakland is
now In circulation.
The old established real estate firm of
Jones & Baker of Berkeley has changed
to R. W. Baker. & Co. J. R. Steeves,
\u25a0who has long been identified with Berke
ley and its development, has become a
member of the firm. They have a long
list of the best Berkeley property.
The firm of Hale Bros, of Berkeley has
divided Its interests. The brothers form
erly conducted two offices, one In North
Berkeley and one at Dwight way. J. P.
Hale, who conducted the North Berkeley
office, will to-morrow open headquarters
at University avenue and Shattuck ave
nue. A. L. Hale will have offices at
Dwight way station.
The Realty Investment Company has
opened offices at Fruitvale for the han
dling of property in that growing section.
The company is composed of S. A. Pot
ters and W. S. Saunders. Mr. Potters
\u25a0will menage the Fruitvale office. They
have Interests In the High-street Tract
and a number of other choice Investment
propositions.
FRUITVALiE WILL GROW.
One of the biggest deals of the week
was put through by Taylor Bros. & Co.
They have sold for Mrt. / Peterson,
formerly Mrs. Kramm. the property at
the junction of Broadway and Telegraph
avenue. The property la covered by a
three-story frame building, which will be
remodeled. The deal Involved $50,000.
That the realty mariset is still grow
ing firmer Is evidenced by Mason-Mc-
Duffie Company's report that satisfac
tory sales have been made in all of their
tracts during the week; Northlands has
a record of five sales; Hopkins Terrace
three; Claremont four and Fairview Park
four. Brokers In the college town feel
assured that the comine three months
will show the greatest record of sales.
S. B. Kenfleld of 6. B. Kenfleld & CO..
Berkeley real estate dealers, has re
turned from a trip . through Mendocino
County. Mr. Kenfield combined business
and a vacation, as he has on hand several
Important deals in that section Involving
large tracts of land.
This kind of development means much
for the general growth of Oakland. Every
factory that is built on the water front
means an addition of from BO to 500 to
the population of the city. The em
ployes must live in the townr and many
of them purchase their own homes, while
all of them trade in this city, so that
aJI lines of trade are improved.
The latest industry to move from San
Francisco is the Hercules Gas Engine
Company. It was only' two weeks ago
that the Victor Gas Engine Company
concluded the purchase of a piece of
water front property near Twenty-third
avenue, and the Hercules people closed
a d^al this week that will bring them
to this side of the bay. The American
Magnesite Company is preparing to begin
Its operations. The road from Livermore
to the Banta Clara County line is com
plete and the road from the mines to
the county line will be ready In less than
two weeks. The construction of the bunk
ers for the magnesite in the town of
Livermore has been begun, and the trac
tion engine company for hauling the pro
duct from the mines to Livermore is
ready for business. The factories on
the Oakland water front at East Oak
land are nearly completed. There are
several of these, one for the production
of pure magnesite, one for the manufac
ture of fire brick, one for the manufac
ture of building brick and finish ma
terials, and one for the manufacture of
carbonic acid gas, all from the mag
nesite that will be hauled by traction
train from the mines and shipped bs
the Southern Pacific Company to Oak
land.
LARGE DEAL IS MADE.
OAKLAND, Aug. 27.â The development
of business along the water front of
Oakland has been remarkable and Is con
tinuing, new deals being made eVery
week in this .section- Manufacturing
plants are moving from San Francisco
to this side of the bay, -where they can
get acres of water front for the same
price that they . would have to pay for
front feet in the metropolis.
Th^re is plenty of good water front
to be had around the basin of Oakland,
harbor, where the cars run In on one
side and ships sail up on the other, and
as the Federal Government dredges and
deepens the harbor this property becomes
more and more valuable.
A meeting ;of the members of the

it is expected f that \ definite action will

On and after September 1, 1900, ths practice
of making sleeping-car reservations will be dis
continued. ; Sleeping-car tickets will be sold jJn
advance. ; This change : Is made for. the 'purpose
of better accommodating. travelers. > Very often
duplicate reservations have been: made 'for one
person, while ' st ' ths â¢ same : tim.s > others have
been denied accommodations I which they; could
have secured i but â¢ for : these duplicate . reserva
tions.' In many cases â¢ reservations are made,
and,* although ths i traveler changes his " plans,
he falls to Â«.. give i notice t thereof, - consequently
the space goes unoccupied, while other travel

'â¢The lao .Valley, which we explored, is
another most interesting place as a sam
ple.of what erosion can do. ; It Is,- Indeed,"
beautiful, and' it presents charms for the
botanist as well as for, the , geologist. : .
S "On Hawaii we went . across the lava
flows to the Volcano House; and no per
son can . have | any ' possible idea of what
rough country i 3 j until Ihe has . been over
that. To a geologist the whole trip was
most instructive, though \u25a0 to the â¢' man I
must admit that -It was fatiguing â¢at
times. The magnitude and extent of the
flows ..were most surprising jto , me, .: ex
pectant as I was . to see something very
big. It was all of absorbing : interest to
me, for it was the ' first \ time ' that ; I had
ever seen v an 'r active volcano, though -I
have studied volcanoes = for many years
and had seen many that were extinct." '
"That the Islands have been gradually
bullt up, layer after layer, from volcanic
discharges seems certain," said Professor
Perkins, "and separate Islands have
gradually become - merged. Take Maul,
for instance, as a' striking < example tof
this. There cannot -be any doubt that
East and West Maul were once \u25a0 separate
islands, and the same .' may be said "of
Hawaii, when Mauna? Kea and Mauna
Loa were once upon a'tlme separated. â\u25a0
"The problems - presented: here are
unique Haleakala, .on me Island of Maul,
is to my mind one of the most wonderful
natural objects in the world. As a crater
it is -marvelous, :but. to. a/iy man who
loves nature the cloud . effects to be seen
at both morning and " evening there can
never fall .to present a . most absorbing
source of interest and delight. I > cannot
begin to describe them. I have not
enough words in my vocabulary, and all
thatl could do. was to slfand watch the
splendid changes In mute and round-eyed
wonder.- \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 .
HONOLULU. Aug.; 27.â That the Ha
waiian Islands were at' one time much
more numerous, but collectively of small
er area, than at present is one of the con
clusions reached by Professor. G. A. Per
kins of the University of .Vermont and
State Geologist -. of the Green Mountain
State, and by Professor C. H. Hltchcok
of Dartmouth, who have been here for
several weeks studying geological condi
tions In these islands. â¢

\\>ather Report.
The \u25a0 yawl's bowsprit caught , the
sloop's mainsail, ripping off two or
three cloths and tearing away the; top-'
ping-lift and the ring from the after
end of the main boom. No one on
either boat was, hurt, but the Queen's
excellent chance of winning one of the
handicap prizes was lost. The mis
hap was' caused by the miscalculation
of Skipper Ward of the yawl, Who ap
parently 1 thought that he could clear
the sloop. *
. Xearly the whole of the San Fran
cisco fleet ' cruised "to Mare Island on
Saturday, droping j anchor^ shortly be
fore dark. The fleet the
flagship Challenger, theschooners Chls
pa," Martha and Virginia, the sloops
Ariel, White Heather,- Merope, Thetis,
Nautilus, Queen, Amigo, Curlew, Annie,
Thelma, Juanlta, Sappho and Mlnne
tonka, with the ' yawls Tramontana,
Witch, Royal and Jester (formerly Ne
reid). : The Corinthian sloops Nixie and
Mlgnon also . lay at: anchor off Mare
Island yesterday.
The start In^the arbitrary handicap
race was made on signal from the flag
ship at.* 11 a. m. across, an imaginary
line drawn from the Vallejo Yacht Club
float to the nearest point'on the Mare
Island ' shorei the ' yachts ' having ten
minutes within which to cross the line
without; penalty. ; Agood breeze -took
the fleet. down Mare Island Straits and
Into San Pablo Bay,' but off Point, Pi
nole the wind- fell. -At the Brothers'
Light, a good .breeze ..was picked- up,
which continued strong": until -Raccoon
Straits .were reached, where all the
fleet except the Challenger .and Chlspa
were .bunched. - Ten boats | crossed the
finishing line at the following times:
Challenger,.' 4:22:55;, tChispa, 4:42:45;
Ariel, 5:03:30; White Heather, 's:o3:so;
Martha, 6:04:50; Merope.s:os:oo; Thetis,
p:05:30; Nautilus,. 5:06:00; Tramontana,
5:07:00:- Minnetonka,* 5:27:05. ; The
starting times were ; taken on the Val
lejo Yacht Club ; float and * will* be c re
ceived-tfere by mail l to-day. . Though.lt
is not possible to declare the winners
of the three' handicap prizes positively,
it is certain that the sloop Me
rope, - owned -by 'Holm *â¢ arid Rousseau,
which had a handicap' of one hour from
thescratch boats Challenger, \u25a0 Tramon
tana and Chispa and finished only 42:05
later - than. Challenger, will .go very
near â¢ the first prize.; ' The sloop -Nau
tilus, which' received fifty, minutes from
the scratch boats, /will- also be well up.
The race was under the management of
the regatta' committee,' Roy C. Ward,
L. P. Rixford and H.G. Toll, The
sloops Annie and Thelma^ ran aground
off Mare Island light'but soon came off.
The. sloop Queen then ."overtb
the California Oil Company's "works', on
the Contra Costa shore, while the; rest
of the . fleet" chose a course out -in J the
open bay." Then the yawl cruised in to
ward the" Contra Costa shore and while
on the port tack came "bearing, down
upon the Queen, on. the starboard tack
and having the right of way. 'For; a
moment it seemed the Queen would be
struck amidships, but she just escaped
this fate. . ,
The most exciting Incident of tho
race -of the San , Francisco Yacht Club
fleet from' Vallejo | "to',SausalitoVyester
day was .the * collision between Harry

Winner of Captain Siebe medal â Q. Rosberr.
Quayle is not going to accept the .offer,
he declares, 'because he hopes to have his
papers restored to him. He has lived lnSan
Francisco more than seventeen years and
the greater part of that time has been in
the Pacific Mail Company's service. He
was on the Sydney for more than five
years, and he asserts that the only thing
the matter with his papers is that one
of the , witnesses who vouched for him
had known him only three years.
The last word of the Carmencita was
brought here on Friday; by the steamer
W. H. Kruger, which reported . that the
sealing schooner had been spoken August
6 off the St. Paul Islands.
Quayle was selected; he surmises,- first,
because of his supposed desperate plight
and, secondly, because of his knowledge
of Spanish and of the ways of South
American republics. The Chileans were
tc be c.hosen because of their ignorance
of the English language, which would
help to keep shrouded the secret of the
Carmencita's disappearance.
With his Chileans Quayle was then to
sail the Carmencita to either Chile or
Peru and there sell the vessel. '
\u25a0\u25a0:.â¢ i . \u25a0 \u25a0 . . ' -
Leopold Quayle, who was chief officer
of the Pacific Mail Company's liner City
of Sydney until the secret service ; men
discovered that , thÂ© papers'by ; which \u25a0he
enjoyed the privileges of American citi
zenship had vital flaws in them, declares
that the day following the announcement
that his naturalization^ papers had boen
taken away from him he was approached
by the owners of , the; sealing, schooner
Carmencita, whose skipper is wanted on
a charge of piracy, and- offered an op
portunity to make some easy . money.
"They thought, I -guess,", he says, "that,
having lost my. papers, I would be .willing
to jump at anything."
Who made -the offer- Quayle will not
say. He was asked, he explains, by a
well-known business man whose name has
been mentioned in connection with the
Carmencita's troubles to take a crew of
Chileans to Dutch Harbor, and at some
point in the vicinity of that port to join
the: Carmencita. lie was to bear, a let
ter of instructions to Captain Alexander
McLean. . McLean was". to surrender the
command of j the schooner to ;Quayle^. go
ashore and get as far away as possible
from the reach of, the United-States

were to made drunk, landed and al

CORK. Aug. 10.
ff^HE only really cross person whom I have seen in Ireland Is the ancient
I dame In charge of Blarney castle. 1 could not appease her by tip. or pleaa
ant word, or even by buying a souvenir cup at the outrageous price
which she demanded. She was a kind of a human Cerberus, with a taste, I
fancy, not for the legendary honey cakes, but for Irish "mountain dew."
' Her ungraciousness would have disappointed me had I not already met at
Blarney . station a stationmaster who
exemplified the traditional trait of thi3
town which holds the famous stone of
flattery. As it was, the memory of his
silver speech still charmed me into af
fability.
. I had objected when he insisted upon
taking from me the ticket which I had
bought at Maelow v for Cork, with right
of stopover at Blarney. â¢
"What shall I have to show that I
have paid my fare further, when I
come back here from the castle*"
"I'll not \u25a0- forglt," he reassured me.
"Sure, not another sich handsome girl'll
come into Blarney this day."
As you pass through beautiful Coun
ty Cork you feel that you have a right
to expect something unusual In the
way of good nature from people who
live in the midst of such a smiling love
liness of nature. The scenery remind
ed me of that of the Connecticut Valley,
only the sunlight was more diffused,
and the air was softer, and. the wind
coming from the south, had the scent
of the sea.
Cork, the city, is attractive, too, es
pecially in the outlying portions, away
from the close business streets and the
dingy quays -of the river Lee. Queen's
College, near by, is beautiful, with
handsome buildings, and grounds that
are remarkable for - their flowers, fine
trees and vistas of the river. Return
ing thence to Cork. I came by way of
Sunday's well, across the Lee, and
found in this humble neighborhood
rows of comfortable little houses, most
of which were overgrown with roses.
Passing right beneath the famous
bells of Shandon, in the tower of St. ,
Anne's. I reached the butter market,^
and stood for some time watching the
busy scene much interested in the way the inspector* ran to thÂ« bottom ot
each keg a long tool that. looked like an apple-corer with a silt in it* side.
Each sample they examined carefully, and marked the keg from which it came
A or B, according to quality.
At Blarney castle I had been pleased to recall that it was to the old Irisa
tune called "The Groves of Blarney" that Moore fitted the words of ThÂ» Last
\u25a0 And here in Cork I was haunted also by sweet old melodies, particularly
"The Banks of the Lee" and the "Bells of Shandon."
A literary reminiscence also gave me pleasure, for many scenes I looked
upon were already familiar through "William Black's description of them In
the book whose title he borrowed from Father Prout's song.
VBut even had I not possessed these associations with the place, Cork still
would have bad for me an individuality as attractive as It was distinctive.

WHAT .to luck? Why is It that some people seem peculiarly endowed with
cower to claim their own in the important transactions of life, while
others seem quite as emphatically; to lack that ability?
What is the 'secret of this mysterious . something that enables one person to
command the .influence, the encouragement and the promotion he desires wnue
another quite as gifted and fully as cap
able struggles on, year after year, never

strives? ;â¢'- .
There are many discouraged ' men and
â¢women i asking this question to-day, and
asking it bitterly. Perhaps they have tal
ents "and capacities that were never rec
ognized. Perhaps they sought in vain
for the stimulus and help that was be
stowed upon persons less gifted than
they.
Was luck responsible for the success
of those others? If so, what .is luck?
What is it that makes this man or
'.woman lucky and that one unlucky?

Example,' this: -They speak of '"tenth."
But dare not lisp of "cerementh."
You ' think they have. an easy time, '
When oft they cannot find the rhymeâ
And there they are!
A LOVELY â¢ damsel thought she'd write
." A poem that was charming, quite,
And so she sat and; writ and :writ
About the birds that flit and flit.
And beams that glance, and soothful ey"e3,
And other things that poets prize.
Until she tried a rhyme for "month"â
Of course, she couldn't speak of "onth";
THERE SHE WAS!
"A lady whom I know says that 1 men
generally are strong, gallant, brave, chiv

"Well, the other three are ciphers."
T SHOULD like to be my very best self,
.* ; And" you'd like to be the same,
And we'd like to scorn the glitter of pelf,
But it isn't, you know, in the game;
So we play bur cards, as the people say.
And I criticize you, maybe,
Remarking, "It's really a very bum play,"
â¢ And you say the same of me.
But after the game is played and o'er
Perhaps the Dealer will' know .
That to stack the cards we at times for

And will give us a better show.
The cards I have played were a rather
poor lotâ
Don't whisper, "I told you so,"
For yours were the same, as likely as not.
Though you wouldn't confess It, I trow.
But whether- we play an ace"., or a tray, '
I judge it will do us.no good,
If we're able to say at the close of the day,
"I did the best that I could.".
For the question of questions for me and
you,
The question of praise or blame,
Perhaps ,will not deal with thecards we

But the way that we played the game.
THE GAME WE PLAY.

Now it came to pass that the Man
was weary and sore discouraged so that
the Children, who were wise in their

to' play, while the Woman said to her
self, "It Is woman's place to endure."
" r "What is ' the matter, dearest?" the
Woman tenderly ' inquired.
" "Oh," the hull dum thing is wrong!"
"Oh, don't say that, dear."
."Yes, it: is! The hull dum thing is
wrong! Just' as soon as I git every
thing, to sailing smoothly I strike a
snag, and I bark my. shins and tear
my trousers and coat, and \u25a0 everything
goes ripping."

taken, darling. You only feel that way
because you are tired now. You ' are so

SELF aggrandizement at the expense of the Koreans-is the com
plaint brought against the Japanese in a memorial address vn T
officially received by President Roosevelt from 8000 Koreans
Jiving in Hawaii, who claim to represent the sentiments of 12,600.
000 of their countrymen. The petitioners state that there is a clause
in the treaty between their country and the United States which
gives them a claim upon us for assistance, and this is the time
they need it most They think that during the negotiations . going
on at Portsmouth for a 'final settlement the influence of the Presi
dent might be used to secure to the. Koreans that square deal and
fair play which he is noted for advocating. \u25a0 According to the cynical
views of these appealers the Japanese are championing the cause of
the Koreans against their exploitation by the greedy Russians with
the purpose of exploiting those helpless and peace-loving; natives
for themselves. ..
â¢ t The memorialists are polite and politic enough not to charge the
Rising Sun Government with positively, ordering exploitation; they
complain that the Government passively permits it to be done by its
subjects and soldiers. "They have been, during the .last eighteen
months,, forcibly obtaining special privileges and concessions from
our Government, so that to-day they practically own everything
that is worth having in Korea." Not a single thing,' they say, has
the Japanese Government^ done in the way of fulfilling the: promise
of bettering,the xonditionnrf the Korean people j.but on the. contrary
has turned' loose several thousand, rough, nationals, vvho.are .disor
derly and are threatening inoffensive Koreans .in a most outrageous
manner. From this high-handed bullying they wish Velea.se, ' and
think that the request of President Roosevelt might aid them in
.obtaining it. They~also wish . that their promised 'independence in
the future will be assured to them as a reality and not -a' mere
name. . . \u25a0 â¢â¢ > .. <\u0084.â¢...,... .'\u25a0 .

I T^ is: really, surprising how business .keeps, up. .It is" now about
eight years since the 'current prosperity^ began with the 'dec-:,
tion of President McKinley and the return of ; the Republican
party with its intelligent commercial sykerri to power, and there
are no signs of any trade reaction yet. The present era of business
activity will go into American history; as one ,of the finest .ever
enjoyed by the country, and it has already exceeded in duration the
most sanguine anticipations. 2 ' * ",r
Last week was still another Ijrisk one;.? with commercial re-,
ports from all sections of the country not only cheerful, but de
cidedly optimistic. The autumn demand, for merchandise _\u25a0 is be
ginning earlier than usual and is large and expanding. If it con
tinues as it has commenced the last half of 1905, according to. the
predictions of. the different commercial statisticians, will be a rec
ord breaker. Reports to Dun's from about forty leading industrial
centers state "that with hardly ah exception mills, are working.. to
their full capacity, many have orders enough to keep them fully
employed for months to* come, and the volume of contracts: far ex
ceeds that for the .corresponding time,; last year. All of these forty
sources express the most sanguine anticipations foiÂ»: the coming
year. The immediate cause of all this activity and optimism is the
fine prospects for the crops, which, with the single exception of cot
ton, are now about out of danger, and promise very large yields.
The usual statistics affirm this view. The railroad earnings
are still running ahead of those last year, the gain, thus far in
â¢August being 5.3 per cent over those of August, 1904. The bank
clearings for the week just closed showed a gain of 36.8 per cent,
with only eight of the first. sixty cities and towns on the list show
ing a decrease. The increase at New York was 51.4 per cent, at
Boston, 80.7 per cent, at San Francisco 22.4 per cent, and so on.
The failures, however, which for. some months, have been smaller
than those last year, have now turned the other way, and last
week were 190, against 150 last year. The money market, how
ever, is easier, and funds continue plentiful everywhere, with rates
of interest still low. The rate is expected to rise somewhat with
the demand for .moving the crops, and call money has indeed
.risen slightly during the past week, but is still unusually low for
'this time of the yean
The different staples are still firm, " with all of them active.
Hides and leather, footwear, wool and woolen goods, clothing, dry
goods, iron and steel, provisions, lumber and other building ma
terials, dairy products and a long list of food staples are firm and
selling off well. The farmers are reported in excellent financial
condition all over .the . country. The merchants, wholesale, job
bing and retail, are remarkably unanimous in reporting business
active, with profit margins large rather than small. No really
adverse reports are received from any section of the country.
Wall street, which is a most excellent trade barometer, re
flects this current prosperity. The feeling there is decidedly bullish.
While there is no boom in the country's stock market, the tone
of industrial and railroad stocks is persistently strong, and the
bears find it impossible to depress values for any length of time.
The powerful financial interests have their shoulders under the
market and apparently propose to keep them there indefinitely.
During the past year weak holders have generally been shaken out
of the market and stocks are in 1 strong hands. There is no dis-
. position to inflate valueSj however, for it is felt that stocks are
on a comfortable dividend basis and are as high as they ought to
be. The public are evidently in the market, for. whereas the daily
sales during the midsummer ranged along. about 500,000 or 600,000
shares, they have lately been in excess of i^^jopoJ-hXh
Conditions on this coast. continue bright, but show no material
change, f All classes, of trade, domestic and foreign,' except the
exportation of grain from this port, are reported flourishing. Our
fruits, fresh, dried and canned, are meeting with, a very brisk
demand, the two latter especially. Our dairies and creameries
are enjoying a period of large production and high prices. Grain
is selling comparatively high. Hops and wool are both away above
cost of production. Hides are in execellent- demand, witrr price 3
marked up every now and then. In short, almost every product of the'
California farm is meeting with a brisk demand at prices which net
the farmers handsome returns. # The city and interior banks re
port money abundant and interest rates moderate, and there are
few complaints of slow collections. Building operations continue
extensive and real estate transactions frequent and .large and easily
negotiated.. On all sides is heard the same cheerful note of com
mercial activity and good times.

Tfcus the Chinese boycott situation
was summed up by F. F. Tong. who Is
at present In Portland on his way to
Washington, D. C, as a special envoy
from the Eraepror of China. Continu
ing Tong said:
"The American people have no true
idea of the extent of the present boy
cott. It is confined to no one class â
men, women and children are united In
it. Even a child of a few years, enter
ing a shop to buy an article of a few
cents* value, will ask if it came from
America, and.'. lf euch is the case, would
not take It as a present.
"The immediate cause of the boycott
was the discrimination against Chinese
merchants and travelers by some of
your exclusion laws. Several such
cs?es were reported by our consuls
here and aroused great Indignation, es
pecially among the merchant class."
PORTLAND. Aug. 27. â "The boycott
upon American goods In China will
never end until the Chinese people are
admitted freely Into the Upited States,
or until the same discriminations are'
made against the inferior classes of
other nations as those which are made !
against the coolie of China." ;
Dr. Tong States It Will Last
Until Laws Are
Changed.

in which all the difficulties we had encountered
were removed.
An order issued Saturday by i Percy T.
Morgan, president of the California Wine
Association, closing the company's win
eries in Fresno County and other parts
of the State, was unexpectedly revoked
yesterday, and to-day the winemaking
establishments will resume operations.
The reopening of the wineries after a
day's cessation of business Is due to a
long telegram from the Internal Revenue
Department "at - "Washington ~ regarding
certain rules of the service that were
responsible for the action of President
Morgan. Discussing the matter last even
ing. Mr. Morgan said:
The rules of the Internal Revenue Depart
ment are very strict regarding- the making of
gfape wine axid Imposes severe penalties upon
those who viola;* them.. This year's ruleÂ«
were far more rigid than we had expected and
really worked a hardsip upon the wtnemakers
of California. Fearing that we would be un
able to strlctls- comply with the law if we
continued to operate our ewett wine plants
<!urlbg the i-eatcn. j which opened a week ago.
the stefociuxlcn decided to close its wineries.

The hotel management yesterday
wired Little's firm in Chicago of the
fact of his disappearance.
Yesterday the police were advised of
Little's disappearance and are now try
ing to trace him. When last seen Lit
tle appeared to be in the best of health
and spirits and this fact has suggested
to the hotel management and the detec
tives the possibility of his having met
with an accident or foul play. The
<ondition of the missing man's room
plainly indicates that he had not
planned to be absent for any length of
time.
His absence did not at first cause any
uneasiness to the hotel people, for they
thought that possibly he had absented
himself from this city for a few days,
but when it was prolonged over 'an un
reasonable time an investigation was
instituted without result.
The day after his samples were
placed on display Little dropped out of
sight and all trace of him has been
lost.
House Detective Glennon of the Pal
ace Hotel is busily engaged in an ef
fort to discover the whereabouts oi
fate of E. S. Little of Chicago, who
mysteriously disappeared from the hos
telry several days ago. Little is the
traveling representative of a big milli
nery establishment of Chicago, and ar
rived here about fifteen days ago. Sev
eral days later Little, as is the custom
of commercial travelers, arranged his
groods in his sample rooms in the hotel
preparatory to showing them to the lo
cal trade.
Chaptn's trouble is paresis. Last week
he become violent. He issued checks to
several of his friends, advertised for a
wife and' demanded that the Crocker-
Woolworth . Bank "cash his checks for
$100,000, though he had no fund? - ther ?.
Chapin was regarded as one of the best
lumbermen 1 of ; the country. The doctors
at the asylum believe that he will die
before long-.
Chapin went to the asylum quietly, and
up to \u25a0 yesterday, has been a model pa
tient. His outbreak was entirely unex
pected. Since he .'has been at the asy
lum telegrams' have been received from
all over" the country Inquiring about hl3
condition. The -same answer has been
returned to all. His conditfon is hope
less, and his death is expected within a
few weeks.
James W. ChaDin, the insane lumber
man, ran amuck yesterday at Agnews
Asylum: Before he could be subdued he
severely injured an. attendant with a
chair. Chapin had been comparatively
docile since he became an inmate of the
asylum, but yesterday he broke loose.
The attendant was about to leave the
room [ where * -ue ' madman was . confined,
when . he happened to look jaround. Cha
pin was ! just \u25a0 about â¢to bring a i chair
crashing . down upon , his skull. The < at
tendant seized the chair and a desperate
struggle took : place. In his maniacal
strength Chapin almost overcame the at
tendant. The man was exhausted when
help. arrived. It took four burly attaches
of. the asylum to subdue the insane lum
berman. ; ,;' --iV-*i V-*
The atmosphere presages the rapid
coming of affairs social. The clubs are
waking and giving notification of their
Intentions for the near future. Traveling
continues to be lively, while the results
of Cupid's onslaughts are amazingly in
teresting.

small headstone in a cemetery In the
western part of the State is pointed out
to visitors as one of the sights of the
neighborhood. ;It was placed over the
grave by a. widower/ who. while not lack
ing in love for the departed one. was
penurious to a degree. He ordered a
small stone because it was cheao. and
told the mason to engrave on lt this in
scription: "Sarah Hackett. Aged Ninety
Years. Lord, she was Thine." The stone
cutter said there was too much inscrip
tion for so small a surface, but was told
to go ahead and "squeeze it on some
how." Here is the inscription as
"squeezed": "Sarah Hackett. Aged 90.
Lord, she was Thin."â New York Times.
Perhaps She Was.
Any one who saw the gallant way In
which the green grocer flung a couple of
roses on to the lap of a charming lady
who. aat on. the top ot an omnibus that
passed his cart In the neighborhood of
Kensington the other 'morning would
have hastened to declare that chivalry
Is not dead in this prosaic age of ours.
The lady blushed, the ; green grocer
grinned, and a wave of romance seemed
to have passed over the roof of that om
nibus which affected even .the early
morning crowd that occupied it. Sudden
ly th* driver looked ovei . his" shoulder
atthe favered one./ "Might I trouble
you for that rose, miss?" he remarked.
"My brother never forgets my little gal
at.'ome If I 'appen to pass 'im on* 'is
rounds." Politeness made him add:
"Won't you keep the little 'un, miss?"

; West Cities Will Assist
; * CH ICAOO, Aug. 27.â Before the middle
of this week every union printer in I the
thirty-seven shops controlled by the Chi
cago Typothetae will be on strike,: and
before another week .the fight may be
extended to twelve of the principal cities
of - the Middle West, the/ employers of
which are organized, with Chicago Ty
pothetae, into a" ; Middle -West associa
tion. .This , forms a- part of the national
body "of. master printers.
' That - the printers I will : put up a long,
bitter; fight against thÂ© : Typothetae was
foreshadowed . to-day, . when Typograph
ical Union No. 16 met at Brand's Hall and
raised the strike assessment from 2 to 10
per cent. The union also decided to force
the fighting .by presenting at once the
demands for an eight-hour agreement
and an. agreement for closed* shops. The
raising' of the strike assessment means an
addition of $8000 weekly to the -defense
fund, and the printers say they can keep
900 men on strike without touching the
one million dollar; fund, which the union
says lt is ready to spend if necessary.

done in the Indian fashion b*y means of

was pronounced especially delicious by
the -guests. It was composed of two
parts of gelatine in one part of flesh

An Eastern Character.
The Shaeen Baba is common- in. near r .
ly all North India towns. - This follow
er of the prophet of Arabia goes about
the streets with a hooka all ready for
smoking. He calls out ; to the passers
by, "Bhaia i hooka ~ pulao" v ("Brother,
have a smoke"). The Hindus will take
'the chillumâ -the bowl containing the
flreâ and ' smoke ] direct from it \u25a0 without
the intervention of ; the \u25a0/.hooka." The
Mussulman takes a pull or ; two from
the : snake of -the hooka. Occasionally
heTgets": a copper or" two from those
who ; enjoy his hooka. ; He blesses the
river' with the words, "Abad, raho,
khus raho" : ("Prosper in this worlÂ« ;
be happy").â rPioneer, Allahabad.

ST. LOUIS TO VICTORY
j LARKSPUR,, Aug. 27.â The sun gener-f
j ously poured its rays on this village to
! day and did not overlook the outdoor
I platform and the hundreds of spectators,
of both sexes and of all ages, who "as-;
sembled around the platform to witness
Battling do his outdoor, work. The tem
perature, ranged close to. a hundred in
the sun^ Nelson did not do any road
work this morning, but spent the. fore
noon In meeting his friends.
Among the Eastern friends he met to
day was a route, and Nelson, who is a
J past master in the deaf and dumb lan
l guage. had a long and interesting conver
sation with him. Nelson cracked "some
jokes about his trip through San Quen
tin and; the extreme width of Smiling
lletzner.'s- smile, which \ widens at'the
crowd Increases, and his mute friend ap
preciated them. All the. available- "space
commanding, half a view of the outdoor
arena â¢ was eagerly seized and held by
spectators of all ages and. classes, eager
to Fee Battling do his outdoor stunts.
Smiling Metznerhad a large sign in front

'not. heed his', reques.f arid, his mild push.

fiends to-day, they managed to take the
double-header, and break even. In the
morning Hitt was wild and was batted
opportunely, [ while .bases were., freely
stolen. ,Hogan's fine, throws. ' to bases

given magnificent support. . A pass to

the batting kids, . Henley's .delivery
looking sweet to them. . In the eighth

DA.V OF SORROWFOR SEALS.
Another strenuous session " between- 1
BiJly Nolan. Willis Britt and " Manager: ;
Jim Coffroth ; lESt"^ nig&t ;'^nde*d - "ere . a I
referee for the Brftt-Nelsoh contest -had
been selected. If was the .same old
wrangle and the same old stall for nearly I
two hours. The session finally broke up !
when the principals agreed to meet this j
evening at 7:30 o'clock to try once- more
to agree on a fit man to pass on the
bout. 2~* f 4 : \u25a0
The contest has narrowed down to three '\u25a0
men, Jim Jeffries. Eddie Graney and j
George Slier. The former Is the choice
of Britt. Coffroth suggested the name
of the second man, while Nolan holds
out for the third. Unless . a dark horse
looms up at the conference to-night; it j
looks like one of these three, with Graney \u25a0
the most likely man.
Willie Britt was strongly in favor of !
Jeffries and sang his praises for an hour j
In a vain attempt to win . Billy Nolan
over. When the , latter was given his
fling, he began to tell the * assembled
hosts what a great third man''' ln : the
ring- is George Slier. The praises of
both celebrities were lauded and lauded
till the atmosphere fairly, reeked with
them., but still no choice was reached.- ,'
When the deadlock looked like a
thing that would last for a while. No
lan suggested that . Britt pick his fa T
vorlte man and he would do the same
and then flip a coin. This' proposition
did not look good. to" Britt. He would
take no su/jh chance and refused to en
tertain such an Idea for an Instant.
Time was flying and Manager Cof
froth waxed uneasy. At last he .com-,-,
mined himself to speech, and politely
informed. Britt and Nolan they .would
have to g:et busy and do something in
record time. He added he would sug
gest the name of, Jeffries, Slier and
Graney and leave it to the" rival-man
agers to make a selection.- If- they
failed., he would wade In all by himself
and do his own picking. . He argued
that if something' definite was not done
directly, -c would have to call the
show oil. as the matter had gone. too
far already. ââ_ . " ; y'^- /. -...;â¢
This idea only served to stir the Ire.
of Nolan. He pointedly informed Cof- :
froth that he and Britt>had agreed to ,
name. the referee and that no third,
party would be allowed to butt In un
der any circumstances. -"I -will forfeit
the $2500 first,"- said Nolan. "If Britt
and I cannot come to an understanding
in this matter, there will be no fight."
"Very well," said Coffroth. %"f% "f have'
more to lose than either of you two gen
tlemen, but unless you can agree -j>n a'
mtn to*referee this bout I "shall select -I
him myself. If you want to -call : the mill t
off it is up to you, but the referee will
have tor be named, and quickly now." J
At this Juncture Billy Britt interposed]
and begged that they be allowed, till this i
evening at 7:30 o'clock to make. a final !
stand. Coffroth saw no other way out of
the difficulty' and decidedv to grant th*
appeal.' It is hoped the ' naw jocular]
looking situation will be straightened out J
before another day passes. ;
Billyh Britt advanced the name of Jack :
Welch early in the proceedings, but as j
there was an objection on the part of the ;
club it was dropped without further cere- j
xnony. . - Nolan strongly advocated Billy j
Rocap. a Philadelphia sporting writer,
but Britt objected on the ground he did
not know the gentleman. Nolan turned !
down Eddie- Smith for the- same reason, j
It is safe to say there will be a 6 much
wirepulling here to-day as at- the Ports-
conference.
>- -Nelson's attitude at the present time is
far different from that of a few short ,
weeks ago. Before the match was made \
any referee would suit him and any con- j
ditions. Now. that he has the match, all j
Is changed. His continued refusal to ac- ;
' cept Jeffries puts* him in a bad light ;
with the public Jeffries* has never been
mixed up in any. Jqbbery, and It Is too ;
late for him to commence now. With him j
in the ring Â»the flght would have to be
square, l. It's up to Nelson to name a bet
ter man^ If he can. -

I When the Commuters ' had - finished

' Siwashes atÃecreation Park yesterday ,
i they, managed to complete ai whole cir

'than ever will . possess with

1 . The \ Siwashes, >as usual, clouted . the
I ball, -and hard : too.'at times, hut ; what
' does abase; hit bring a ball team unless
; a- run happens once.. in a .while? Never
j an inning passed in 'the lafternoon game
' unless ' some â¢ Seattle- istar <â¢â¢ journeyed
j down', to first, but. -he .invariably wais,

way. station.' '.';'"\u25a0'.. '.. *I 'â¢â¢ ..' -'â¢
Oakland continued. to '.wallop that
leather -harder even than in the' pre-;
I vlous games. Nearly 'every man on the
team 'seemed to be "there with some-,
I thing, :arid; when --one hit, 'theÂ« others
I were wont to go right down the line and
j follow his example.' Dunleavy again pa-,
raded at" the head of the bunch. In the
i afternoon game he. came up four times
and landed for a triple, a double and 'a
pair of singles..' At 'Oakland In*- the
morning he sdused out one single out
of four trips to the pan. â¢
Oakland ushered the game in with
its' usual-vigor by clouting
Hall for two runs'eTe he had a chance
to set his wing^ti motion. They let it
go at that till the fifth, when. two more
.were sent through! 'In 'the'seventh a
regular; bombardment \ was begun, and
before the ; Siwashes knew what, time it
was, three more of the .Commuters had
found their way - : home and : the score
stood 7 to 0, the finishing figures.
Seattle certainly should . have scored
on Ham Iberg. " He let th^m have eight
safe ones ' and passed five men to the
bags. ThÂ© : Northern stars were not
there when they.managed to geÂ£ a man
on the* gacks.v Time & n d -time â¢' again
a good chance .was -passed iipi. None: of
the , players - seemed : overanxious .' : to
.grab,, a* hit when.' it ..would' have prob

the] game was- reeled off by the ;yan-
Quished:team.".; , x ::. ". '.';",,."..,:\u25a0â¢. |
; The work' of Rubs" Hall at short was
the. only: thing, that upheld the., honor
of the visitor* to any extent. < Twelve
hard ones came the way of the Siwash
leader and ihe ate "every \u25a0 ono* up. He
doubled up Devereaux joh | Mo3klman's
hard drive in the ilrst Inning, when two
were on the sacks/and, thus, saved

Â« Murdock has announced his intention
of not playing in the. singles tournament
at San Rafael. He" has decided to give
all his energy to "the doubles, which he
hopes to win with. Hunt as a partner. It
ir. doubtful if Hunt will play in the [.sin
gles either.
Janes and "Adams ne^t took on Gard
ner and Charles Dunlap, but failed to win
a set of the ..two played.- The score in
favor of Gardner and Dunlap was 6-2, 7-6.

played, each sjde winning one. The first
set went ,to . Foley and Dunlap by- the
unusually close score of ; 14-12. The sec
ond set .was a vantage .also, but the
Bakers came out. on the long end, win

In singles Gardner , and Griffin played

On Saturday Percy Murdock and. Reu
ben Hunt of Alameda played Harry.! Rolf e

the bay, -Murdock and. Hunt will be the'
main | reliance of. the . northern contingent
in the doubles ' "tournament, . while
Schmidt and Rolfe are one of the strong
est reams on this side of the bay. The
Alameda cracks won three straight sets,

. Fred Adams, . the State champion, , ana

at San Rafael in the doubles, and should
make .one of" the strongest, teams., from
this part of the State. They played": to-;

work caused them to make a.rather,in

Adams and Janes . first';, played Carl
Gardner and E. P. .Finnegan; 1 and were
beaten by a score ,of 7-6. Flnnegan's

The demure; looking little .gymnasium '
out at Sheehan's .villa on the ocean beach,
where Jimmy Britt. Is going through the
finishing-up process- for his prolonged ar-
Sum^nt with Nelson" resembled
a department. store .on the occasion of a
bargain sale, yesterday. Of course, the
friends of Britt read daily" in- the papers
of his looking as* bronzed â¢as a Mexican
j. bean pot from a trip In the Sierras,- and
I harder than a Barbary Coast rounder,
I but they ; evidently want to see for them
f selves. Then, again,' betting people these'
; days like' a* ; sample of . the. gdbds, before
[ making a purchase. * v Â«:"
: ' The early arrivals ;at '-Sheehan's were
I welcomed by Manager Willis VBritt, who
I announced that Jimmy and hia right
I bower, "Tlv" Kreling, , had gone: for a
| horseback ride, but that they would re
j turn in time to, fulfill .the. 3, o'clock mati-
I nee engagement. Shortly after 1 o'clock
! a big stir was created around training
I quarters, an.d hundreds made a rush for
â¢ the beach as two' scantily clad athletes
'emerged from the gymnasium and made
[a spurt for the breakers. Instantly the
[striped bath robe ; of J. Edward Britt was
[recognized on one, and he immediately
became the cynosure of/ all eyes. But it
proved a false alarm. Charley Bush; the
well-known restaurant man, who par-,
leyed an oyster â¢ cocktail stand into an
eight-story brick building and more, is a
personal friend of the crack lightweight,
j with carte-blanche to use- any of, the
training- paraphernalia. Charley and a
i friend wÂ«.re merely taking a dip after
I some flight exercise, entirely innocent of
â¢ the sensation they had created. *' .
Jimmy Britt and "Tiv" Kreling re
turned from their jaunt shortly before 3
o'clock, and at 50 cents a throw all avail
, able space in the gymnasium was quick
; ly taken up. At "ten, twent' and thirt" "
j the main tent of the biggest show on
I earth could not have accommodated the
i crowd assailing, the windows and picking
; choice cracks in the sides of the struc-
I ture. All agree that the plumber boy
looks like a freshly minted 'Copper cent.
!He lacks nothingâ but the long end of ] the'
! purse, and Jimmy assures his friends that
j this will surely be added to his menu.
! Some disappointment was evoked because
j bdxing was eliminated from the pro-
I gramme yesterday, a slightly lame
j knuckle being given as the excuse. Spider'
j Kelly eaid, "Why, sure; " cut out the
Â« mitts," and, of course, that settled it."
For more than an hour Britt kept
i things humming, af the expiration of
which the perspiration was leaking
from nim-llke rain through the roof
of an Oregon hotel. Skipping the rope
nearly a thousand'times, he thenlarti-"
basted the punching bag. After seven
minutes' fast play the cord attached to
the leather spheroid parted, nearly
ruining the new $4Q"autumn bonnet of
a fair lady spectator"'; "In its flight.

Detective Bailey spent the greater
portion of yesterday investigating the
case of an explosive that destroyed
windows , and a . portion -of the wood
work in front of the Tahoe Social Club
at 104% O'Farrell street early yester
day morning. .
The conclusion of the police, is that
a crank, who has been writing threat
ening letters to Adalph Franzini, pro
prietor of the. club, is responsible for
the act and that the explosive was set
off more for the purpose of "creating
a nuisance than with an object of the
destruction of property and life.
For several months Franzini has
been receiving many letters. All were
coached in the most foul language and
requested the proprietor jto discharge
one "Red Nose Joe," also .a "Captain
Rice," from his employ. -Franzinl says
he believes a Russian. Jew, whom, he
ejected from the club some \ time ago
for dishonest gaming, is. responsible for
the authorship of the communications.
A man named Dan Taylor, who is at
present out of the city.- told Franzini
that' the person, suspected had made
other threats 'aguinstl- him. A; similar
attempt is said* to have been made at
the Seattle Club' some time .ago, .but the
police have no record of<it. The bomb
was a shiall "one andiwith the -excep
tion of ' the ; shattering : of glass could

The bodies of two victims of carbon
monoxide were taken to the Morgue
yesterday. A man, who registered at
the Hancock House. 781 Mission street
on Saturday night as Charles . Smith,
wae found dead in a closet of his room
yesterday morning. He had fixed a
tube to the gas jet and after turning on

in the closet, had placed the other end
of the tube In his mouth. There were
in his pockets a knife, key and thirty
cents. Under his hat band was found

Cooks' and Walters' Union, 147 Mason
street." He was about 55 years of age.
S. Taprushi, a' Japanese laundryman
employed at the residence of attorney
Eugrene Lent, 1050 Eddy street, was
found. dead in bed about 1 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. The gas was escap
ing from a jet in the room. It is sup
posed that he had accidentally turned
on the gras while turning off the elec
tric light. It is a combination gras and
electric fixture and the gas key was
very loose. He was about BO years of
age.
Brown had been a sufferer from con
sumption and had been in the hospital
since August 14. Patients are allowed
to be out till 9 p. m. and when Brown
failed to make his appearance at that
hour on Saturday night the nurse. Miss
J. E. Edwards, reported his absence to
the office. A search was made, but no
trace of him could be found. Dr. Wall
gren, while taking a stroll around 'the
grounds about S o'clock yesterday
morning:, saw Brown's body dangling
from the tree.
James K. Brown, a patient at the
City and Count*' Hospital, committed
suicide on Saturday night by haging
himself to a tree in the southern end of
the yard which is reserved for women
patients. He had also cut his left wrist
with a razor.
! While on a rabbit hunt in a section of
i Holy Cross Cemetery .Edward .Come ac
j cidentally shot Charles Boliner yesterday.
Come heard a, noise In the underbrush
and fired. A charge of bird shot struck
I Boliner, most of it/lodging in his head.
! Several pellets entered both of. his eye
balls, and he will probably be blind for
life.
Come and Boliner started out early yes
terday morning, both of them carrying
shotguns. They separated and started
I through ,the underbrush, walking in par
allel lines. Come was accompanied by
Powell At ola, and Boliner had with ; him
George Davis.
Come and his companion tramped for
some time . without encountering any
game. Suddenly they heard a noise in the
underbrush. Come cocked -his shotgun
and waited.. Something brown flashed in
the bushes and he pulled the trigger. The
roar of the shotgun was followed by a
ehriek of agony.
Come dropped the weapon and rushed
through the brush. He caw Boliner lying
on the : ground, with Afola beside him.
The full charge of the barrel had struck
Boliner in the head and face, blinding
him.
The injured man was led from the place
and the first conveyance was com
nyindeered. He was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where all that could
be done was done for him by Dr. Pink
ham, but it is feared that his eyesight
has been totally destroyed.
Boliner was afterward placed in the
care of Dr. F. J. S. Conlan. The injured
man and Come have been friends for
years. Come is heartbroken over the ac
cident. . rÂ«v'->-..
