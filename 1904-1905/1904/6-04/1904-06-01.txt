This cablegram has been received at
th<Â» Navy Department from Rear Ad
miral Chadwick, commanding the
South Atlantic fleet at Tangier:
"The seizure of the American citi
zen was by insurgent chiefs, so as to
bring pressure on the Sultan of Mo
rocco to secure the demands of the
tribe. Our sense of the gravity of the
case is Fhown by the presence of the
American squadron and will undoubt
edly cause the earlier yielding by the
Sultan of Morocco to the demands of
the chief, which Is the only safe
means of releasing the captive."
There iÂ« the highest authority for
thff statement that an attack on
Tangier or an expedition against the
brigands will be followed by the im
mediate murder of the captives.
WASHINGTON. May 31. â Through
EmbaEsador Porter. Secretary Hay
has requested the French Government
to exercise its good offices toward
securing the release of Perdicaris, the
kidnaped American in Morocco. The
French Government has undertaken
the task and because of Its closer as
sociation with the various elements In
Morocco it Is believed here that it can
accomplish more than any other gov
ernment. The British Government also
is acting with great energy in behalf
of young Varley. the stepson of Perdi
caris, and a British subject, and the
British officials are in communication
with the United States Government in
the pursuit.
Admiral Chadwick is not expected
at present to land a party from his
fleet to pursue the brigands, but it is
ptated positively that if Raissouli car
ries out hiis threat to kill his captives,
the United States Government will in
sist that he be run down and executed
a i any cost.

through Erabassador Porter, has tele
graphed instructions to the French
Minister at Tangier to use his utmost
endeavors to obtain the release of Ion
Perdicaris and Cromwell Varley.
American officials are hopeful that

ence of the American fleet at Tangier,
win 6ecure an adjustment of the af
fair. Reports through French oSrial
channels sbow that Raissouli's de
mand Sbr ransom ie $70,000.
The American view is that if the
ransom should be paid through the
family of Perdicaris, Raissouli'B de
mand could be dealt with subsequently
and the money restored, but the
French officials who are familiar with
ice- situation in Morocco are less san
guine of a settlement, owing to claims
that Raissouli has put forward which
threaten to raise political and inter
national entanglements. According to
information reaching the Foreign Of
f.re, he requires the Sultan to give
him a subordinate kingdom, wjth the
right to levy taxes throughout a region
embracing thirty-eight square kilo
meters' lying directly along the main

mystery to-day than when he sent a

criticism of his public acts and worry

the subject. Coroner Hayden and Cap

ing of . ten students, who have Just been or
dained.
Philip Kobertson, prospector and
miner, received the dying man's con
fession and tells the story simply and
dramatically. Robertson left the Klon
dike capita!, he says, late last fall in
a small boat bound for the new placer
grounds at Fairbanks. He reached a
point near Dahlney River in a desolate
a.nd forbidding region, when the for
lorn wailing: of a dog surprised him.
He found the dog, a half -starved shep
herd, seemingly in much distress. Fol
lowing the animal, Robertson was
brought to a seemingly deserted cabin
come 400 yards above the river, con
cealed in a clump of ppruoe.
"I ventured to the door.bf the shack
and knocked." says Robertson, "and
there was 'a feeble *coraÂ« 'in.'
"All was darkness inside and there
â¢was no sign cf a fire. I "caught sight
of a bit of candl** on the table, ahich
I lighted, and then advanced to where
a rna-n lay.
"With a feeble effort he turned and
Ftared at me for a. full minute. YThen
he said: 'Are " you an officer?' The
question amazed me a bit. 'No,' I said,
'1 am a miner and if there is^ anything
I can do for you I want to t do It."
CONFESSES HIS CRIME.
"I soon had a fire going and again
approached the bed. The man's hair
*as white as mow, his face had a
color in it that looked like death, and
he had the raost terrified and hope
less expression that I have ever seen
on a human being. â¢
" 'Partner,' he said, finally, rolling
over on his side, and little .more than"
whirperimr. 'I'm leaving a world that
I did not- appreciate. I'm going to
. where I belong.*
"He lapsed into silence again and.
Â¦vnat I thought' was sloop came over
him.. Two hours passed and' he sud
denly wakened with a shriek and theri
isank back in bed- â . "; ;Â¦ '
"In a few, minutes-. he gave another
â¢wild scream and. straightened up in
bed. Then, in a voice you would
think only came from a "good strong
man, he said: 'See here, boys, my
name is Tascott. I'm Tascott. Do
you understand? I'm Tascott, that
they have been hunting. They've been
hunting me like a wolf for years. I
can't run any more. I'm getting paid
for what I did. 1 know I'm dying
and I know where I'll go. Tell the
boys vhen you go back that I'm Tas
cott and, you can tell the world, too,
for the world has hunted me a long
time.' .. .
DEATH COMES SUDDENLY.
"About 3 o'clock in the morning I
heard a noise like a man expelling all
the air from his lungs. I rushed over
to the bed and felt the man's pulse
and heart. He was dead.
"The next day his partners got back
and I told them what happened. They
were the strangrett fellows I've ever
met in the north. They did not say
who they were. They did not . even
thank me for staying with their dead.
They did not even ask me to Join them
at their meal, but they buried .Jjie
man, and, rolling up their things in
a blanket pack, started across coun
try in the direction of the Koyukuk.
"Before going one of them came to
me abruptly. 'See here.' he said, 'you've
pc-en and heard what you've, heard.
You can't make anything by talking
about it. He's dead, and that's all
there is to It.' '
'"Before I could ask him anything
he had struck the trail and that was
the last I saw of him. I have never
told about this until now, but that
dead man asked me to make his story
public and I do so. I believe
that he was tortured to death by
thinking of his own life and the belief
that he was always the object of pur
suit, and I surely believe that he
told the truth in saying he was Tas
cott. It is my opinion that his part
ners knew it, too." SOB

Replying to the communication from
the National Rifle Association General
B. A. Spencer admits the general truth,
of the allegation, but he denies that
the Americans wilfully contravened the
rules of the contest. He says they
brought two patterns of rifles and as
no objection was raised to the pattern
selected they \ thought they were en
titled to use it. General Spencer point3
out that it was well, known to every
body that these rifles were to be used
and no secret was made of the charac
ter of the rifles.
The Times, in a long article summar
izing the Palma trophy correspond
ence, and commenting upon it, will say
to-morrow that the trophy is likely to
remain In the United States forever if
a challenge is waited for from this
country or perhaps from -any other.
"The scene after the reading of Gen
eral Spencer's letter," the Times will
say, "was one of dramatic and very
significant silence. When Lord Cheyle
more asked If any members desired to
say anything there was a silence of
scorn or of sadness or of both. There
was really nothing to be said except
that conduct of that sort, combined
with the complete absence of shame in
confessing to it. rendered further com
petition for the trophy impossible for
honorable men."
" LONDON, May 31.â At the spring
meeting of the National Rifle Associa

correspondence between the National

Association relative to the allegations
that the American team which won the
Palma trophy in 1903 did not use the
national arms of the United States and
therefore did not conform to the con
dition of. the contest. He regarded the
Incident aa being most regrettable and
said It was very unfortunate that it
ever occurred. The object of the coun
cil in sifting the matter was not to
seek to reverse the result of the match
or arouse any bitterness, but simply to
clear up the serious question which
had been publicly raised.

According to the papers filed, Mrs.
Elias' husband was a negro and her
husband threatened .to do the plain
tiff bodily harm and expose him. The
plaintiff states that he paid Mrs.
Ellas $68,000 z* different times be
tween the years Ib96 and 1904. It is
further alleged that Mrs. Ellas told
the plaintiff that she could not obtain*
a divorce unless her husband received
$0000 ar.d that as a result of threats
made by her he paid that sum or
money and she obtained the divorce.
This amount, he alleges, never was
paid to the husband and" during the
yev 1S97 he was coerced into paying
the husband, who in the meantime had :
been divorced, the sum of $16,000 not
to press a threatened suit. ;
Platt demands an accounting of all j
the moneys which he alleges Mrs. j
Elias has wrongfully obtained; that ;
the real estate and bajik accounts be
impressed; that the defendants be re- j
strained from disposing of the prop
erty and a receiver be appointed to
collect the rent of the property, and
that any other relief that the court |
may decree proper be afforded. . '<
There are thirty-four .'trust com- '
panies. twenty-six savings banks and
sixty-nine national banks and other
banks that are" made codefendants
with Mrs. Elias. The action ag&inst
the banks is nominal and is taken to
prevent them paying any money to
Mrs. Elias.
The papers go on to say that soon
after Platt formed her acquaintance
she told him that he had gained her
love. Platt says that these protesta
tions of love were a scheme on her
part to enable her to. coerce and black
mail him into giving her large sums of
money.

named Williams, said . his victim had
interfered to separate him (Williams)
and Hannah Elias. WDllams was de
clared insane and sent to an asylum.
He had annoyed Green for some time
and Green had said he never saw the
woman Williams referred to. It devel

had become wealthy and occupied a
costly residence in Central Park -West.
At the offices of the. plaintiff's at

WASHINGTON, May 31.â The Su

In the Southern District of Ohio to re
cover $50 p'ald by him as a penalty for
the sale of a fifty-pound package of
colored oleomargarine containing a
stamp tax of three-quarter* of a cent
a pound Instead of 10 cents & pound.
McKay's counsel argued first, that,
although the "oleo" was colored to
look like butter, the color was obtained
by the use of butter which was itself
artificially colored, but the use of which
as an ingredient In the manufacture of
"oleo" was authorized by law: and.
second, that the tax of 10 cents a pound
was prohibitive and confiscatory and
an attempted federal usurpation of the
police powers of the States.
The court said that the tax con
templated the finished product and not
the details of- manufacture. If the
"oleo" was colored it should have the
higher tax and if uncolored the lower
tax, regardless of how obtained. As
to the amount of the tax, the court
said it was settled that the court could
not consider the amount of any tax
fixed by Congress, this being purely a
political function.
The court therefore affirmed the

The Russians destroyed the big pier
and blocked all the dock entrances with
sunken steamships. They destroyed all
the small railway bridges in the vicin

injured.
It is evident that the Russians fled
quickly when Nanshan Hill was lost,
expecting that General Oku would im
mediately take possession of Dalny.
All previous reports of the occupation
of the town were false.
The dockÂ« and piers at Dalny were
not* destroyed. Bandits occupied the
city after the Russians left and levied
tribute on the inhabitants. A Chinese
contractor, who had built, most of
Dalny for the Russians, was held for
ransom and his cle?ks werÂ» killed. The

LONDON, May 31.â A dispatch
from St. Petersburg to the Central
News says it Is rumored there that an
attempt had been made to assassinate
Foreign Minister Lamsdorff while he
was at dinner this evening.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 1. 5 a. m.
The rumor that an attempt had
been made to assassinate Foreign
Minister Lamsdorff is untrue.
ST. PETERSBURG,, May 31.âGos
sip concerning Count Lamsdorff's
early retirement from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs is renewed. The re
port in the present instance seems
based, not so much on political
grounds, as upon manifestations of
Â¦personal hostility outside ministerial
circles. The fact that Count Lams
dorff notified foreign diplomats to-day
that he would not receive on his reguÂ»
lar reception day, to-morrow, is being
used to add color to the reports of his
retirement, although this may only
be a coincidence of little significance.
Such notifications have not been un
common during the past year.
It is considered that these reports
may be spread by ministers who are
his personal enemies, and some of
whom, it is well known, have, sought
to undermine him for some time.
PARIS, June 1.â The Echo de Paris'
St. Petersburg correspondent wires:
"Count Lamsdorff was assaulted to
day while out walking by Prince Del
gourouki, formerly pretender to the
crown of Bulgaria. The Prince was
immediately arrested." *

In chief of the fleet and ports and of
the defense of the Baltic Sea. The ob
ject of the consolidation of the com
mands is to insure uniformity in the
measures adopted in the defense of the
coasts of the Baltic during the exist
ing state of war.
The renewed intimation of; foreign
mediation in the war is considered in
Government circles to be entirely out
of r>lace and impertinent, in view., of
Russia's SDecific declaration in diplo
matic circles that mediation was re
garded as being beyond the range of
possibility at the present time.
"Shortly before noon on May 30 our
cavalry opened fire near tne railroad
station at Hagenfuchu against an ad
vancing Japanese force consisting of
eight companies of troops and four
machine guns. During the ensuing
battle our mounted men brilliantly at
tacked a Japanese squadron on the
enemy's left flank and almost com
pletely annihilated it. The sotnias
then attacked the infantry, but retired
under the fire of the machine guns.
The advance of the Japanese infantry
in order to turn our left flank was
stopped by the fire or our battery,
which inflicted considerable loss on the
enemy. Our losses have not yet been
definitely ascertained, but so far as
known one officer and 20 men were
wounded and 25 horses were lost.
The Russian press is sparing of its
comment on the Kinchou affair, but
there is an" evident disinclination to
accept the Japanese official reports in
their entirety. The general tone of the
papers Indicates the belier that in the
event of the fall of Port Arthur It
would not decide the war. Much praise
is given for the splendid defense of
Nanshan made by the Russians against
superior numbers. â¢
The statement emanating from Paris
that General Kuropatkin was sending
30,000 troops to the southward in an
attempt to save Port Arthur from the
Japanese . is declared here to be un
true..
"Up to May 29 the Japanese had not
occupied Siuyen. All is quiet on the

"On May 30 the Japanese advanced
toward Saimatsza. Their movements
were watched by Cossacks. When this
telegram was dispatched the Japanese
had not arrived at Saimatsza.
There is considerable talk in unoffi
cial circles regarding the strength of
the Japanese force which engaged the
Cossacks at Aiyangpienmen. It is evi
dent that the Japanese have a large
body of troops northeast of Fengwang
cheng, which, it is suggested, will ad
vance when General KuroKl deems the
moment opportune to effect a turning
movement on Mukden.
"At 10 a. m: they formed up in order
of battle, the force consisting oâ¬ two
battalions, with one other in reserve.
At 11 a. m. a battery of artillery took
up a position and opened fire with
shrapneJ. While crossing the valley the
Japanese infantry, advancing in close
formation, suffered heavily. At 11:20
the Cossacks, observing that the Jap

retired in good order on Saimatsza. The
fire of the rear guard ceased at 2 p.

ALUMNI GIVES BANQUET.
The executive committee appointed
by the general committee of the State
River Convention met last evening at
the headquarters of the California
Promotion Committee. 25 New Mont
gomery street, San Francisco. There
were present at the meeting President
Rufus P. Jennings. W. S. Boggs, John
W. Ferris, E. W. S. Woods, George W.
Tatterson and Samuel Frankenheimer.
The committee decided to carry on a
big: campaign to get the assistance and
co-operation of all interested in river
improvement. The first step will be
to increase the membership in the
River Improvement and Drainage As
sociation of California, which asso
ciation was formed by the members of
the recent convention. The increase
of membership will naturally follow
from the great interest which is al
ready felt in the work. The commit
tee decided to work on one general
<omprehensive plan, which should be
for the ultimate good of the entire
region which it is desired to improve.
ThÂ«Â» "sentiment was expressed that a
broad general plan in harmony with
sll Interests Fhould be adopted before
the work was undertaken and that In
all local work affecting local Interests
the needs of residents of contingent
localities should be consulted.
Those who are conversant with the
situation say that there will be no dif
ficulty in securing adequate -State and
Federal, aid. The convention was har
monious and as this is the first time
he California river men have ever
'got together" it is a reasonable as
sumption that they will receive that
lid which is recognized as a public
lecessity. â¢-"â¢.-

WEDDINGS TO

The blaze was a bad one to fight,
there being a quantity of gasoline, tur
pentine and coal stored In the build
ing. The fire, which started on the
second floor, completely gutted the
building, which was filled with fancy
machinery and a large quantity of iron
and tempered steel. The fire was con
fined to the one building in which it
started, that being isolated from the
rest. The loss is understood to be cov
ered by insurance.
Fire broke out in the ware and stor
age house of the Vulcan Iron Works,
on Kearny street, near Bay, shortly
after 10 o'clock last night. Before the
flames were under control the contents
of the building, valued at $50,000, had
been damaged to the extent of $l#,000.
The fire, which Is believed to have
originated from spontaneous combus
tion, was discovered by Watchman
Mike Barry. Barry had no knowledge
of the existence of the blaze until the
whole roof of the two-story building
burst into flames. Eleven horses In a
stable in the rear of the warehouse
were rescued.

Mansfield's keen nose detected the
odor of a cigarette and unmindful of
the servant of the Czar kneeling in
suppliance before him on his throne,
he bundled his long robe under his arm
and took up the trail. Up the stair
case at the back of the stage hurried
the star to find a Russian citizen re
posed at ease on one of the sumptuous
wooden chairs In a dressing room
puffing away at a cigarette. The rage
of Mansfield would have brought him
plaudits from the front of the stage.
"What right have you to smoke in
this place? Do you suppose that I
want to pay $300,000 to rebuild this
theater just because you want to>
smoke for a few minutes?" he thun
dered "Do you think I want this
house to burn down because you have
a liking for tobacco? I am held re
sponsible here and I do not propose to
have you nor any one else smoking
behind the stage. Do you hear?"
Meanwhile the orchestra was play
ing the curtain music, the audience
wondered why the asbestos curtain
was bo slow In rising and the Impa
tient gallery stamped on the floor.
When the tragedian did come down
the stairs to the stage the captain of
the supers warned every one to keep
out of the way of the angry actor.
"Don't get near Mansfield to-night."
was the warning cry. "He Is terribly
angry."

RIVERSIDE. May 31. â Matthew
Gage, who a few months ago went to
England with $300,000 to secure. a con
trolling interest in the Riverside Trust
Company, is to-day a ruined man
through the failure of his plans. Be
fore leaving Gage got together every
dollar available and then borrowed
J200.000 from O. Howard Thompson of
San Francisco. He made his invest
ment and expected to be appointed
managing director of the company
which he organized in London in 1S9Â«.
The company instead sent two direct
ors here and as a result Gage was
turned down. The stock he purchased
has been hypothecated to satisfy those
who advanced him money. Gage is
said to be. a large debtor to local
tradesmen, having contracted one bill
of J1200 with a dry goods firm when
his daughter was married a few weeks
ago. Gage has been down before, but
has alwuvs come to the top and his
friends have hopes* that he will again
recoup his losses. '
Gage built the Gage canal in this
valley at a cost of $1,000,000. It waters
10,000 acres of land. Later he laid out
and Improved Arlington Heights, the
finest orange tract in Southern Cali
fornia. Being a larger proposition
than he could finance, Gage went to
London and organized the Riverside
Trust Company, which has a paid up
capital of $1,250,000. He was manager
of the company for some time, but
finally lost control of the property,
which is the largest orange and lemon
growing and shipping concern in Amer
ica. He staked his all on regaining
control of the company and having
failed is practically penniless. He has
removed to Berkeley and declares he
will never return to Riverside.

Charles Xeal. manager of the Fair
heirs, yesterday received formal notice
from the representatives of Mrs. Her
mann Oelrichs and Mrs. William K.
Vanderbilt Jr.. in the East, to the effect
that his services would no longer be
required by the daughters of the late
Senator Fair in the administration of
their j.roperty interests in this State.
The Joint action of Mrs. Qelrichs
and Mrs. Vanderbilt is the preliminary
action to turning over the former's
property in this city, recently sold to
a local syndicate, to which a formal
transfer will be made as soon as the
deeds have been prepared for record.
In the recent distribution of the
Fair estate the sisters divided the city
property between them, but decided
to keep the outside lands, including
the big ranch at Knights Landing, in
tact, so that it might be more readily
disposed of in the future. Mrs. Van
derbilt retained as part of her share
of the late Senator's estate the old
Fair home and the building on Mont
gomery street in which are located
the offices of the Fair heirs, repre
sented by Charles Neal.
Some time ago Mrs. Oelrichs and
Mrs. Vanderbilt designated Tobln &
Tobin of the Hibernia Bank as their,
legal representatives in this city, and
it Is supposed that Mrs. Vanderbilt
joined with Mrs. Oelrichs in giving
notice to Manager NeaL with a view
of having her property in the, future
controlled by Tobin & Tobin, through
the real estate agency of Thomas &
Sans, who. It Is said, will to-day call
upon Manager Neal for a transfer of
the office, which he has held for many
years.
Although Mrs. Oelrichs gave Tobin
& Tobin authority to act for her here.
It has developed that this authority
has not yet been extended to the Fair
mont Hotel, of which she is the sole
owner, for Knight & Heggerty are
ptill acting as her legal advisers in the
construction of the big hostelry on the
hilL Xeal has been connected with
the Fair family in various capacities
for nearly twenty years.
While Mr. JCeals friends may re
ceive the news of his retirement with
some surprise, it was not bo with him
self, for he had been expecting a
change for several months and since
the sale of Mrs. Oelrichs' local prop
erty he has daily looked for the notifi
cation he received yesterday.

At the conclusion of Mr. Taussig's,
address. Clara I. Dillon rendered a de
lightful piano solo and then Principal
Merrill Introduced the graduating class
amidst enthusiastic applause. Mr. Mer-.
rill explained that diplomas were again
granted this year to those that had
taken the three-year course, but this
course would be hereafter discontinued.
The three-year course was instituted
at the time the San. Francisco High
School was giving a three-year
course, while the course in the other
high schools of the State was four
years. The San Francisco High School
is now giving a four-year course and it
is no longer necessary for the 1 Lick
School to admit eighth grade' pupils.
1JST OF GRADUATES.
A COURSE ABOLISHED.
Mr. Taussig referred to public lib
raries as great educational factors. He
complimented the Lick pupils on their
accomplishments and expressed the be
lief that they would take high places
in the industrial world with trained
heads and hands. ......
The speaker discussed the evolution
of the public schools from the charity
colleges of a century ago and pointed
out that they are the result of the
realization that ignorance does not
make for good citizenship and the poor
must be educated as well as the rich.
In speaking of the great good of me
chanical schools he said that the shops
and factories of to-day, with their im
proved machinery, require intelligent
workmen.
He spoke of the human desire for the
pursuit of practical knowledge and de
scribed the pleasure of boys with their
first chest of tools or their first exper
ience as practical traders. To aid in
the crystallization of these tendencies
with culture for the benefit of the com
munity, is, he said, the highest pur
pose of schools.
Mr. Taussig spoke pointedly upon the
subjects of technical education and cul
ture and their Influence upon the af
fairs of life, whether in commerce, in
dustry or the arts. He said that his
time and attention has been devoted to
commerce, but he had maintained
some interest in educational affairs
and in his association with the direct
ors of the Lick School he had learned
something about trade and techni
cal education. No modern university,
he said, was complete without its col
lege of commerce and industry as wel;
as of culture. The relations between
commerce, industry and culture were
worthy of inquiry.
The hall was a bower of greenery and
cut blossoms. Every seat was occu
pied by the friends and relatives of
thiÂ» .graduates, who were enthusiastic
in their approval of the exercises. The
class sat together near the platform,
the young ladies, attired in white and
carrying prettv bouquets, having the
position of honor.
The exercises were short and simple,
but marked by the vigor and directness
characteristic of former like events at
the Lick. Frank J. Symmes, vice pres
ident of the board of directors, presid
ed, and at the end presented the di
plomas. An invocation was made by
l:ev. Louis <;. Sanford, rector of St.
John's Episcopal Church, after which
Percy E. Cecil, one of the graduates,
rendered a pleasing violin solo.
With the announcement that the
board of directors had followed its cus
tom of choosing some prominent citi
zen of wide experience to address the
graduates Mr. Symmes introduced' Mr.
Rudolph J. Taussig.
JIR. TAUSSIG'S ADDRESS.
Fifty-four young men and women,
constituting the largest class ever
graduated from the California School
of Mechanical Arts, were last night

bly room of the Lick School. Principal
George A. Merrill said that it was also

Magnetic New Bargains To Day
A Regiment, of Prices That, Were Already Tottering on the Brink Have
Finally Toppled Over Into Sensationalism.
Impossible as the promise seems, you'll find the bargains bigger to-day than
ever. The balance of this stock must be sold off with a rush. So, to attract still
greater crowds â to intensify your enthusiasm â to arouse your buying interest to
the highest pitch^to lure the dollars from your pockets still fasterâ we resolutely
closed our eyes to loss and sunk the knife still deeper into scores of prices that
even reluctant competition was compelled to admit were the most wonderfully little
ones ever known in this city. Come â and bring your greatest money-saving ex-
pectations with you. We promise that the bargains will prove even better in reali-

longing to the union to wear on the"
lapels of their coats badges of red,
white and blue.
The Boot and Shoe Workers who
were out on a strike and also those
who were locked out returned to the
respective shops yesterday morning.
This act is in accordance with a de
cision reached by the majority of the
union hands, who cast their votes at
the mass meeting on last Friday night
when the question was: "Should the
union hands go to work pending arbi
tration or not?" The vote being in fa
vor of returning indorsed the views
and advice of Vice President Lovely
as against that of one of the local
leaders,' who favored the strike in the
hope of bringing the members, of the
association to comply with the terms
of the union, which would be to keep
them idle for an Indefinite period.
Henry Albrecht, a ybung non-union
stableman employed at Doyle's sta
blft at 320 Sixth street, was assaulted
yesterday afternoon at the corner of
Folsom and". Sixth streets by. three
roughs, one of whom struck. him' a
vicious blow in the face, cutting his
lips and loosening his front teeth.
He was in the act of boarding a car
when the attack was made. The fuf-.
flans escaped by running down Harriet
street. .
i
â¢* Hacks, carriages and coupes, owned
and controlled by the Carriage and
Stable Owners' Association, did not
run last night as predicted, for the
simple reason that the Police Commis
sioners did not issue the permits to
the drivers whom the, .association pre
sented as competent men.
There was as long a session as the
commission usually holas, but the
question of granting permits to the
drivers of vehicles was one of the last
things to come, up. There were twenty
eight applications received, but only
eight were granted, arrd in each in
stance they were for men who owned
their own conveyances.

ARE GRANTED

Several municipal departments axe
preparing to -file strong protests
against trie appropriations of the next
municipal budeet when the ordinance
thereon comes up for final passage be
fore the Board of Supervisors next
Monday. Principal among these will
be the protest of the Board of Public
"Works aÂ«ainst the Item of $2l5,000 set
aside for the cleaning of the public
streets, which is declared to be inade
quate for the purpose.
Commissioner Schmitz was busy yes
terday preparing data on the subject
for presentation to the Supervisors. He
â¢will call attention to the fact that a
report waa filed by the City Engineer
showing that it will cost $90,000 to
equip a municipal street cleaning plant
and $240,000 to operate it for one year.
No provision has been made for the
purchase of a necessary plant, although
the Supervisors want the Board of
Works to have the cleaning donÂ© by
city employes. Again the appropria
tion is the same as that under which
the existing contract for street sweep
ing was let and the laborers are being
paid but $2 a day. whereas the mini
mum wages of city laborers is $2 50
a day.
The Board of Education is also pre
paring a vigorous prdtest against the
reckoning of an alleged surplus of $108.
000 in the total of $1,361,000 for schools.
The board contends that already $75,
000 l of the surplus has been contracted
for and believes that as the money
came from the State the citj- should
not deprive the schools of the benefit.

conference- and camp meeting, of the'
Seventh Day Advent church opens to
Â¦morrow at Rushrod Park, Sixtieth
street and Telegraph avenue, and will
continue until -Sunday, June 12. The
first four days of the conference will
be devo.ted' to conference business. On
the c-pening: day a 'nominating com
mittee will-' select the officers for the
ensuing year. ' . ~
The conference will be opened at 9:30
a. m. by President A. T. Jones," and
after brief services the business meet
ing will be called to order. Evening
So closely calculated was the new
schedule that the exact rate of de
crease has been arrived at by careful
mathematical process and the figure is
31.6 per cent. It was announced to
night in an unofficial way that the new
rates are not satisfactory to the Contra'
Costa Water Company. and that the
company will go Into the United States
courts to resist enforcement at the
schedule, which will be in effect on
July l. .- .Â¦ v- "; Â¦.:. -^
IJv calculating the revenue that will accrue
from the Increased number of services ever
latt year the schedule will figure a 30 per
cent reduction. The (?ross rate of decrease to
tbe company will be 25 per cf-nt on account of
the raJn in re'vmue fcy the increased revenue
from new butlncte.
= In fixing Uie rates thÂ« committee has al
lowed the company Its total operating expenses
*s they have been reuorle.'l -by the company
to the Council. Taste tmcuntins to $.'.0,975 and
*xr>enee $Z5?;< .for. litigation .have been allowed,
as has aln> tsixXi odef for bad d<"btb. The com
mittee eliminated; an Item of f 78.000 for taxex
not paid. TrU amount It .Involved in litira
*lnn. oiÂ»r some of the County AsttesFur's ae
Â¦eesfnents aDd to allow it until the question
U eÂ»ttl'*<! would be simply to make a loan to
the company. It tbe company -Icees in the
future it will be the duty cf the City Council
to allow a rate sufficient to ctSvcr thai amount.
Tfc<? committee believes thai a valuation
that is fair to tbe company ajai just to the
rate payers has been fixed in the amount at
$4.7Ou,W!0. . Thia valuation was reached after
much txpert investigation and consultation,
-â¢!â¢ n vith much, know >'1b> of financial affairs
have been contulu-d with. referenÂ« to the
Â¦ mount of net revenue that should be aJlowed.'
The committee haa, deemed it' wi*e after-.-i'
lull consideration, th^t a- rei-enue of 6 per
cent net .should be <nven over and -above all
exptn?Â«-s "of c^eraticn. . -
The water company has not collected
rates on this figure. According to its
returns last year their gross income
vas J62S.O00 from the Oakland division.
The rates for the coming fiscal year
were, adopted to-night by resolution,
â¢which was reported to the Council from
the committee of the whole after being
recommended in the committee, by
unanimous vote. No opposition to the
rut was manifested either in the com
mittee or in the Council. The rate of
decrease in -the total revenue of the
Oakland division Ut "Hie company as
compared with current revenue will
Jtg-ure 25 r>er-"cem\ The increased num
ber of service.*, however, has enabled
the Council to cut the rate to domestic
consumers <he additional 5- per cent,
enough additional' revenue being esti-Â«
mated to warrant this figure. In sub
mitting the resolution- to the Council,
President George "\V. Dornin made the
following statement in explanation:
This is a horizontal cut off all do
mestic services. The reduction on
rates for municipal service, including
Etreet sprinkling, water to public build-
Ings', school houses and the like, is 30
per cent. The fire hydrant rate Is
lowered from 55 to $3 75 a month, or
25 per cent. The Council fixed a valu
ation of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany's plant in the Oakland division of
$4,700,000 and allowed "the company a
net income of 6 per cent on that valu
ation, instead of 7 per cent net on a
$7 ,000,000 valuation as fixed by Judge
E. C. Hart in the water rates suit.
The City Council to-night by unani
mous vote reduced the water' rates for
the next fiscal year 30 per cent to In
dividual rate payers under the existing
rates.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS..
The closing: of the settlement, it will" I
be seen, will be keenly felt by the)
people of West Berkeley. It .provided"
an interesting gathering, 'place \ for
many of their cnildr^n and besides giv-.
ing them 'instruction in the arts and
trades was the means of amusing thÂ£m
in wholesome ways. The work- was it>
charge of four resident 'workers, 'un
uer whose direction . the Instructions
were given.
Following out her policy of retrench
ment, Mrs. Phoebe "Hearst ljas with
drawn her support from the ' West
Berkeley Social Settlement, the wo?k
that she almost alone has supported
for the last five years. It was thought
that this institution would escape the
leveling hand of economy, but it has
fallen victim at last; Uke the domestic
industries school, the . kindergarten
training school in 'Washington. and' the
other benefactions that . Mrs. "Hearst
supported. In consequence there 'is a
deal of talk going about and people are
asking .what will happen next-
When all the talk was going -on last
week about the withdrawal of- Mrs.
Hearst from -the domestic indastries
school anxious eyes were turned to
ward the social settlement in which
nhe has so long been' interested. -But
it seemed that this noble work must
be spared. But to-day. Miss Sherlock,
the resident head, was forced to say
Â¦that she had since received word from
Mrs. HeaTst that the- benefactions were
to cease at once. She refused to say
exactly what Instructions in regard to
the future of the settlement' Mrs.
Hearst had given, on the ground that
they were only for her private guid r
ance. As to whether the settlement
work could be continued 6y -means of
assistance from other sources she' was
not prepared to say. â¢
â¢ The West Berkeley Social Settlement
was founded nine . years ago. ' Mrs.
Hearst began assisting its. cause
five years ago and gradually the
scope of the â¢ work' has in
creased. '.The hall at 2015 Eighth street
has been enlarged from time to time
.and new activities added every- year."
At the close of the present term 3Q0
children -were taking instruction there
from" forty students of the University
of California, whose- service's were voL
unteered. ;- ' â¢

Ja.mes endeavored to obtain a signed
statement from Price in the City Pris
on exonerating hi.m of the accusation
that he had restrained Price of his
liberty, but the young man would not
word it th* way James desited and the
effort went for naught , . .
Rather than 'get Into- Jail I consented to
accompany him. . When we arrived In Ala
meda Saturday he said I would have to go
with him to his house and that I must keep
out of eight and away frn.m the wlnHow*. asÂ»
he did not want any one lo know that I was
in Atameda. While on the electric car he
ordered me to ride outside ao that people
in the light" on the inside would not recognlÂ«e
me. He compelled me Co givt him the key
tr> my stow. He tried to persuade â¢ me to
usÂ«- every effort to induce my wife's relatives
to raise $Â«00 by mortgaging their ranch and
Mock and said that if I could do- this he would
fix thln?s up easy:
He continually remarked while I was de
tained at his house, "Isn't this a better place
than Jail?" Whenever he would leave the
house he would telephone back to his wife I
about every fifteen minutes to make sure that
I was there and that I was not exhibiting
myself at a window. Now thai. I realize that
I have been imooeed upon and made a dupe
of by James I intend to see what recourse I
have.
MYSTERIOUS ACTIONS.
Jirr.fs found me at Buraon and informed me
that he had a warrant in his pockÂ«-f for' my
arrÂ«Â»et and that if I could not raise about
$600 from my wife's relatives living near
Bur*on la pay my debt* I had better accom
pany him back to Alumeda and cause him
no trouble. 1 eaid that I had no' money with
Vhich to pay my fare and Jamet replied:
"Oh, that -le aJl right. The State will pay
our expenses." He said that if I refused to
go with him he would be- justified in tying
me up and takinc me by force.
Up to to-night the District Attorney
had not decided whether he should is
sue a warrant for the arrest of James,
but if he does not the entire mattter
probably will be called to the attention
of the Grand Jury. In relating his ex
perience while in the control of Bill
Collector James, young Price said:
Prices bail was fixed at $150 cash or
$300 bonds, and as he was unable to
secure it to-day he was detained at
the police station. Joseph G. Price,
father of the man who asserts that
James terrorized htm for three days,
complained to the District Attorney's
office to-day about the high-handed
proceeding of Janies and asked for a
warrant for* his arrest for false Im
prisonment. Deputy W. H. L. Hynes
has been detailed to investigate the
matter and to-day the City Justice's
Court came in fo.r some censure from
Hynep, who expressed surprise that a
warra'nt for a person's arrest should be
given to one not authorized to serve
the same. 'VVv
PRICK IS DETAINED.
AliAMEDA, Mav 31. â George ii
Price, .wbo asserts he was brought, to
this city from Burson, CaJaveras
County, undsr false pretenses by How
ard K.' James, bill collecter, and kept
a prisoaeT by him for three days, was
turned over to Constable Qeorge E.
Clarke this morning by James when
the latter became aware that his pecu
liar method cf trying to secure money
from Price by depriving him of ,his
liberty had reached the public.
Price spent last night at James'
house as well as the two .preceding
nights. This morning when he arose
he wag told by James to go to Pearl
street and Central avenue, where he
would meet some one who was looking
for him: Price, did as he was ordered
end was taken into custody by Con
stable Clarke on a warrant that had
beea sworn to. by F. M. Ltfwe of the
nrm of Lowe & Filkins, in which Price
is charged with petty larceny.
This warrant was Issued by "City
Justice R. B. Tappan on May 27 and
given to James, who. although not an
officer of the court, .took the document
to Calaveras Count'v and through its
use persuaded Price to accompany him
to Alameda. The warrant was not
given to Constable Clarke, according
to that official, until Sundav night, two
days after it had been issued,- and the
constable affirms that the bill collector
did not tell him that Price was in Ala
meda.

A'.. N, official call has just been issued for the seventh

mineral products and mining ..â¢ machinery and invites
other States to do likewise.
Probably; the most important matter to be discussed
is the recently agitated question of advocating the crea
tion by. the Government of an independent department
of "mines and mining. A strong indorsement by the
American Mining Congress,* representing as it does the
combined mining interests of the country, will unques
tionably have' much influence with the General Govern
ment toward the establishment of such a department.

OUR next Congress has a weighty matter awaiting
its august, deliberations. Both houses in session
assembled will have to pass upon the legal status
of the District of Columbia cat, its rights and its privi
leges to continue in the pursuit of life, liberty and happi
ness. The District Commissioners, whose duty it is to
govern fairly and impartially the nation's capital, have
given notice that they will recommend for legislative
action by the next Congress stringent rules for the im
pounding of all vagrant tabbies who cannot give reason
why they should not appear, before the high court of
justice to answer to the charge of being public nuisances.
The Congress of these United States, then, holds the
destinies of thousands of lives in the hollow of its hand.
One shudders and turns his eyes in fear from the con
templation of what must be the uproar in the, halls of
Congress when this great cat issue is brought to the fore
in all its darkling significance. The visions of lobbies,
and' log-rollings, of "influences" and counter-influences,
all the strife and heat of debate arise to point in grim
prophecy to the time when the inalienable rights of the
Columbia cat will be at stake. What will be the attitude
of the Democrats on this momentous question? "Will
John Sharp Williams stand pat or will he bolt the whole
thing and leave the minority to struggle vainly for, the
rights' of the cat against the heartless cruelty of the

The major, who did not require that
a brick house should fall upon him
in order to take a hint, retired and
in a short time returned, attired In
the fatigue uniform of his station and
wearing on his shoulder the gold oak
leaf of his rank. In the most precise
military manner he repeated his re
quest for permission to go to the city.
â¢ The colonel, this time in the most
pleasant manner said, "Why, certain
ly, major, you have my permission to
absent yourself-from the post for the
time you desire."
In civilian dress the major was not
recognized; in the uniform of his rank
he was. It was a lesson in military
etiquette which he no doubt never for
got.
'After, saluting the major smilingly
asked: "Colonel, will you kindly give
an order to permit me to go to the city
for three hours?"
If there is any place where etiquette
is observed it is In the United States

the lowest When Colonel Graha,m
was in charge of the Presidio post
some yars ago . he was seated in his
office reading official documents when
a rather young man who held the

Zebras as carriage horses and for rid
ing -purposes may soon be a common
sight, for a recent experiment at the
London ZÂ«o has . demonstrated that
these beautifully "striped animals can
be" -easily tamed and that they are even
more docile and easily managed when
broken in than trie gentlest of ordinary
horses.
After spending" four hours in break
ing in a zebra Captain Hot-ace Hayes is
able to ride it handily.
His first pupil was Jennie, a 9-year
old zebra, presented to King Edward
by the Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia,
When first led into the paddock she
was fidgety and nervou's. In order to
soothe her Captain Hayes stroked her
gently with a long rod. She stood quite
still during this proceeding, seeming not
to resent it in the least.
But when a man approached her with
a .halter she plunged and reared, racing
madly around and around the paddock.
Presently she quieted down and the
trainer got near enough to slip a. rope
around her right leg. She tried to'klck
it loose, but in doing so got her left leg
entangled. in it. She was thrown for
ward on her front legs In a kneeling
position, and then with a gentle push
sent rolling on her side. Her four legs
were then bound with ropes until she
was utterly helpless." For an hour she
was left In this plight, then the ropes
were removed from her feet and she got
up a meek and submissive creature.
She stood still while a bit was placed
in her mouth and a saddle strapped to
her back. Captain Hayes climbed into
the saddle and Jennie consented to be
ridden. She makes an excellent saddle
horse, intelligent, fast and thoroughly
to be relied upon. â Black and White.

THE President's address at Gettysburg on Decoration
day" was a memorable utterance. It displays to
great advantage his faculty of analysis, his, gift
for going to the actuality "o! a matter. Of thfe Civil War
he .said: "It was one of the few wars which mean, in
their successful outcome, .a lift toward better things- for
mankind. Some wars have meant the triump.h of order
over licentiousness and anarchy, masquerading as liberty;
some wars have meant the triumph of liberty over
tyranny, masquerading as order; but this victorious war
of ours meant the triumph of both liberty and order, the
victory of orderly liberty."
His ascription to the men who bravely fought- on the
other side for an idea was complete and ungrudging, and
the lesson in patriotism which is the country's inheri
tance from the great conflict and its great sacrifices was
splendidly enforced. -Addressing the old soldiers present
he said: "It was because you men of the Civil War both
knew how to use liberty temperately and how to defend
it at need that we and our children and our children's
children shall hold youin honor forever. Here we com
memorate not only the chiefs who actually won this bat
tle; not only Meade and his lieutenants, Hancock and
Reynolds and Howard and Sickles, and others whose
names tlame in our annals, but also the chiefs who made
the Army of the Potomac what it was, and those who
made and used its sister armies â McClellan with his ex
traordinary genius for organization, Rosecrans, Buell,
the steadfast and unyielding Thomas, and that great trio,'
Sherman, Sheridan and Grant, the silent soldier whose
hammer-like blow.s finally beat down the prowess of the
men who fought against him. And finally we meet here
in homage to the enlisted men and officers who served
and fought and died without having, as their chiefs had,
the chance to write their names on the 'tablets of fame,
the men who were buried in the long trenches on the
field, or who died in cots marked only by numbers in the
hospitals." .
The whole address is a model of good taste, patriotism
and self-effacement in the presence of great scene? and
mighty memories. Among the generals to whom he
paid the highest ascription one was a predecessor in the
office of President, and two,. McClellan and Hancock,
were candidates for the great office he holds. But to all
he gave that credit which is "due and -which is rendered
in the heartfelt gratitude- of their countrymen.

The tribes of the East, -the wandering hordes.

Now master the horses and break down the tents.
For the northern lights gleam and we mast go hence;-
We will pass on onr way to the zones of the west,
Our watchword the cry of the bird on the wind,
Tlie sands of the desert are urging behind,

We care not like cravens to follow- the plow, "
We have farrowed the earth with our. spears until now;
A conquering people, a pitiless power, :.
Like vultures and locusts we come- to devour;
In the smoldering ruins where cities once stood
We render, to freedom a tribute of blood.
And when we have conquered and garnered ocr gain
And. the foemen are chanting their dirge for trie slain
We mourn not in sorrow, we wail not In woe",
Xor build we a tomb for the heroes that died, . . *
The snow it will cover, the night it will hide .
The sanctified horror of corpses below.
Where flowers were once blooming now eddies the sand.
The sea is now breaking where once there was land;
Where then is there rest for the dead ones, I pray?
They live in the runes and the songs of the race,
They dwell in the glory of time and of space,
And we are their envoys forever and aye. -

Zacatecas, Mexico, in the Santa Rosa
district, near Bonanza. From time
Immemorial it has been an adage
among 'miners that the best mines
have be#n located by accident. Pros
pectors have been known to discover
a lode through the kicking of a- piece
of metal from an unknown ledge by
their mules' hoofs. Cripple Creek was
discovered through the merest acci

in- the Santa Rosa mine, while search

had -never even suspected the existence
of- turquoise. Telling the stor>V Man

"Mrs. Clement was a large stock

Bonanza; and it had been the joke of
the other members that she was always
prowling around the dump picking up
pieces of ore and claiming they were
all sorts of things, other than' what
they were. One day about thirteen
months ago she went out to .the dump
and picked up a pretty light blue stone
which was very hard and shiny. She
thought it would do for her collection

It is now time to revise our methods of naturalization.
Under the present law any court of record, having a
cletk and a seal, can naturalize aliens. The United
States, which confers the privilege, has no exclusive over
sight of its extension to individuals. Perdicaris comes
here, goes before a local court after five years' resi
dence, gets his final papers and goes back to the Mediter
ranean never to see us again. This was not the inten
tion of the law. When a man cast his lot with us, it was
expected that he remain a producing and. tax-paying citi
zen, doing his jury duty, and while of military age liable
to enlistment or conscription to defend his country. -But
he left us, permanently domiciled himself in Morocco,
safe from jury duty and military - service, paying no
American taxes and in no- way contributing to this
country. He merely ran over here and put on American
citizenship as a shirt of mail to protect him abroad.
The United States can protect itself against that sort
of thing only by taking exclusive charge of naturaliza
tion. The probation should be lengthened and the nat
uralization officer should be in Washington. Federal
courts should take the testimony in each case and put
it before him for final review and determination! If
American citizenship is worth seeking at all, it is worth
a good deal of formality and inconvenience that should
be put upon the seeker and not upon the officer. We
have made it so cheap that it commands no respect
from a great many who get it with so little trouble. It
should impose upon the recipient reciprocal duties and
obligations, so that he cannot take it and. go away to
embroil us with other governments, in such affairs as
this of Ion Perdicaris.
THIS 'Government has been embroiled . with ; M.o
rocco more than once in behalf of American citi
zens who did not speak ;our language or know
anything about our institutions. When we dealt with
the pirates pf Tripoli," and put an end to their depre
dations upon Mediterranean commerce, .the people of the
s'outh shore of that sra and others inclined to.' go there
conceived an exalted idea of the might of this* country.
It has followed that many' who wished to take advantage
of business opportunities there have prepared themselves
by seeking and procuring American naturalization. The
Sultan of Morocco has a wholesome respect for Ameri
can rights and American .gunpowder. But his unruly
people and the wild tribes that are nominally under -his
.sway have but little regard for the hot water in which they
can put him by assaults upon the person? and property
of naturalized Americans in the midst of them. fj?/?%
There has been a revolution stewing in Morocco for
two years and the tribes have taken advantage of a
weak government to do as they please. In pursuit of
their vocation of getting gain and making trouble, they,
have captured the naturalized American Ion Perdicaris
and his stepson, a British subject, and carried them off
to the mountains. The bandit chief, Raissouli, seems . to
have more than a frugal mind. He hot only demands a
heavy ransom for his prisoners, but that members of his
.band now held prisoners by the Sultan shall be released',*
and that the Sultan shall recognize the bandit's terri
torial and tribal rights, and that the United States guar
antee and maintain those rights.
There is nothing small about Raissoali. He is in
clined to enter world politics and play the game with
the Czars and Kaisers. Of course this Government can
give no such guarantee. We can demand that' Morocco
pay a ransom to secure the prisoners, and the Sultan is
free to make any promises he pleases to Rassoulli, but
we will not underwrite his paper. We may co-operate
with Great Britain in a military expedition to relieve the
imprisoned nationals of the two countries with the cer
tain result that Perdicaris and his British stepson will
be kiljed before we get them. Thereafter such a punitive
Â¦expedition may at great cost catch Raissouli and tan
his Morocco hide, and exterminate his robber tribe, and
we may .make the Sultan pay the bill. An American
must be protected wherever he is, and those who cap
ture and kill him must be punished. Though Perdicaris
wa^ probably naturalized not to become an- American
and dwell in our tents, but in order to get our protection
while seeking fortune abroad among a turbulent people,
still he has. received the chrism, of .our citizenship, and
whatever he is he represents it and we cannot leave him
undefended.
. But this case brings up quite another question. Per
dicaris is probably a Greek, as the form of his name in
dicates. When" he became our fellow-citizen, it was not
'to becojne an American by sharing our political lot at
home, but in. order that he might be safer abroad than
he would be as a Greek. Though he is lawfully^ citizen,
bis purpose was not in line with. the spirit in which we
share our birthright- with aliens.- When we forced ex
patriation treaties upon most of the European powers, it
was to emphasize the .American position that among
the natural rights of man is his right , to. expatriate-him
self, cast off the allegiance- of his nativity and assume
another, with all of its obligations. It was believed in
Europe that we took this position because our popula
tion required recruiting by immigration, and it is not de
nied that such may have been among our motives,
though it was not written in the treaties. We gave evi
dence of it in making the. short time, of five years the
probationary period required for final naturalization and
protecting a man's, domiciliary rights after his. first pa
pers were issued.

that' gold" is only one of the* many valuable minerals
successfully produced here, the great importance of the
mining industry becomes "apparent and seemi to justify
the Rational Government in making special provision for

Another important question to be discussed is that of

conditions previously existing for handling the* gold out :

PRESIDENT PREPARES
' -.FOR SUMMER OUTING
The successor to the chancellorship
made vacant by the death of Father
Scanlan will not be known until the
return to San Francisco of Archbishop
Riordan, in whose hands the appoint
ment rests. Â¦ .
The graduating exercises in connec
tion with St. Joseph's Parochial School
to-morrow, which were to have been
of a public character, will, out of re
spect to the memory of Father Scanlan,
be privately observed.
The school roll bears the names of
1200, those in, the higher grades tak
ing a business course in conjunction
with the ordinary study. - The school
received particular attention from the
late rector.
Besides a brother and a sister sur
viving him Father Scanlan leaves sev
eral cousins in ' the State, the Rev.
Father M. D. Slattery, pastor of St.
Agnes Church, Page street' and Ma
sonic avenue, this cltv, and grand'
chaplain of the Y. M. I.; Mrs. b. A.
Shaw, residing at the Marguerite, and
Judge Lennon of San Rafael.
The Rev. Father Daniel Slattery,
who died in Marysville October 9, 1860,
and the Rev. Father William Slat
tery, who died February 18, 1882, In
Petaluma, were first cousins of the late
Father Scanlan.
RESPECT TO DEPARTED.
On the death of the Rev. Father
Hugh Gallagher, Father Scanlan was
appointed to the rectorship of St. Jo
seph's, San Francisco. A man sensitive
to the suffering of the unfortunate,
Father Scanlan became endeared for
his benevolence. He was beloved by
all who knew him, this regardless of
creed or station.
He was attached to Marysville for a
while and then moved to Sacramento,
where his pastorate of St. Rose's
Church continued for about 16 years.
The late Father Scanlan was 68 years
of age. He was ordained a priest June
24, 1864, at All Hallows College, Dub
lin, and shortly after came directly to
San Francisco.
The funeral services, according to
present arrangements, will take place
Tuesday morning from St. Joseph's
Church.
A telegram was received by the Rev.
Father Kane yesterday at St. Joseph's
Church from the Rev. Father O'Sulli
van stating that the -remains would
leave New Tork last night, escorted by
Father O'Sullivan, who will telegraph
from Chicago the exact time of arrival
in San Francisco. It is probable that
the remains will arrive on Sunday af
ternoon. â¢ '
"When it was first learned here of
Father Scanlan's illness the Rev.
Father Eugene O'Sullivan hastened
from the city to New Tork and remain
ed constantly with the patient until
the end came.
RECEIVJES LOVING CARE.
* The Rev. Father Patrick Scanlan.
rector of St. Joseph's Church and
Chancellor of the Archdiocese of San

hour yesterday morning after an ill
ness of several weeks' duration.
With the Intention of visiting Rome
and various parts of Europe and pay
ing a visit to his sister. Mrs. B. Mur
phy, and his brother, James Scanlan
of Lixnau, County Kerry. Ireland, the
late Father Scanlan left San Francisco
on April 7.
He had been but a short time In New
York when he developed pneumonia
and though for a time he showed signs
of an entire recovery about a week
ago complications developed and it
was seen on Saturday last that the end
was approaching.

BEAVER, Pa., Mav 31.â For two
hours to-day during the funeral serv
ice's over 'the body of Senator Matthew
Stanley Quay business was suspended
throughout the entire Beaver Valley.
Not a wheel revolved In any Of the
numerous mills and workshops in Bea
ver, Rochester, New Brighton, Beaver
Falls or nearly a dozen other centers
for miles around.
The leave-taking In the home was
silent and sad. There were brief serv
ices by the Rev. J. R. Ramsey, D. D.,
pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church, consisting of a prayer and a
few brief words of consolation to the
family. Only the family went up to
the little bedroom above the Senator's
beloved library and took a last, look at
their dead. Mrs. Quay broke down
again and cried as she did by her hus
'.band's bedside on Saturday afternoon,
when the physicians told her he was
dead. v . '
A private service was held at the
house and under a guard of honor from
the Beaver G. A. R. post the remains
were removed to the Fourth Presby
terian Church, where for three hours
the I public was given an opportunlay
te v^w the face of the dead Senator.
Floral tributes from all parts of the
country arrived. A large silk Amer
ican flag was draped across the cas
ket and no other decoration marked it.
At the public services a committee
of the United- States Senate was . in
charge "as a guard of honor. The serv
ices were marked by_ simplicity. . The
body, at the close of the services, was
PORTLAND, May 31.â A bold rob
bery was committed shortly after noon
to-day by two negroes, who entered the
office of the Pullman Company at the
Union Depot 'Just as the cashier. W.
H. Aurelius, was making up his cash.
Drawing revolvers upon the cashier,
the negroes demanded what cash was
in sight. Aurelius handed over about
J25C0. The negroes backed out of .the
office door with th*r revolvers pointed
at the cashier, and then hastily disap
peared. Aurelius* description of the
negroes is an imperfect one. .
The coolness exhibited by the robbers
and the thoroughness with which they
did their work, together with thei nice
ty with which it had been planned, in
dicate that they were old hands at the
game. The theory that they were white
men disguised as negroes is not be
lieved, as the features, as nearly as
Aurelius could remember, exhibited aM
the characteristics of the negro.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. May 31.â The
three through trains marooned near
Quenemo, Kansas, for twelve hoora
yesterday by the flood which had
washed out portions of the Santa Fe
and Missouri .Pacific tracks, reached
here to-day. A majority of the pas
sengers were eastbound, many of them
coming from the Methodist General
Conference at Los Angeles and others
from Et Paso. All trains 'carried dln
insr cars and there was no suffering.
OTTAWA. Kan., May 31.â Flood con
ditions in this vicinity are fast Im
proving, the water to-day receding
rapidly. Communication with North
Ottawa, where several hundred per
sons were driven from their homes,
was opened to-day with boats and pro
visions were taken to the unfortunates.
Six men marooned in the Santa Fe
depot, who were without food since
Sunday, were brought away to-day.
Many others were removed from the
flood district, some of whom had been
forced to upper stories or to their
housetops. The needy are all beins
cared for by the city authorities with
the aid of local churches and lodges.
The country- west of Ottawa for sev
eral miles haa been swept clean, crops
having been wiped out and much
stock drowned. All bridges here have
remained intact, but train service is
still at a standstill, the tracks for miles
being under water.
The case of Mendazona vs. the United
States, involving the same Question,
was similarly rendered in favor of
Meadazbna, '
Another Philippine case wa& that of
Dorr and O'Brian. in which was raised
the question of the right of a defend
ant in a criminal case to demand trial
by Jury in the Philippine* in the ab
sence of Congressional enactment
granting such right: The court- held
that the constitution floes not carry
right without legislative Â¦ enactment.
Dorr and O'Brian are the editors of a
newspaper, published in' Manila and
were prosecuted for criminal libel. '. Â¦ Â¦
"WASHINGTON. May 3Lâ In the
.Unltefl States Supreme Court opinions
were, handed down to-day -In three
cases, . involving questions pertaining
to administration- of criminal- law in
the Philippine Islands. The points rais.
ed were as to the right of the'Govern
'ment to take appeal In criminal cases
and of an accused person to demand
â¢trial by Jury;-'
â¢iThe. first case was that, of Kepner
vs: the United States. Kepner prac
ticed law in Manila and was charged
with .embezzlement The cqurt of the
â¢first Instance acquitted -him, but the
Supreme Court of the islands convicted
him. The case was then appealed to
the Supreme Court. of the United States
.by Kepner on the ground that by the
process of appeal he was put twice in
jeopardy contrary to the constitution
of the United States. The opinion by
Justice Day . sustained this view, re
versing: tlie decision of the Philippine
Supreme Court. Justices Holmes.

ing capacity, nor can thev digest the dead Phosphate of Potash taken from the drug

plains why white flour is useless to restore Brain and Nerves.)
In GRAPE-NUTS food these elements are. presented. in the most liberal pro- .

Leon de Bernardll Who along the water front
answers to the title "King of the Newsboys,"

locked up at the Harbor police station,' charged
with disturbing the peace. Bernardl a few
days ago entertained Mayer Schmitz, ; some of
. the. Supervisors; Police Judges and other
public officials at dinner and since then, say
the police, has been somewhat "Vhesty" In
his attitude toward the world in general ana
the police force In particular. -
As 'the queen bee is surrounded by her re-
â¢talners, ' so is the newsboy king always es
corted by a squad of less distinguished Journal
venders. Bernardl arid his "gang" â¢ took sta
tion yesterday in one of the gangways leading
from the Oakland boat.
"You must leave that passage clear. Gat
outside where you belong." said Policeman P.
K.O'Keefe, whose ancestors were In the king
business themselves. :
"Back up," replied the- "Newsboy King."
"Get next to yourself and don't bodder me."
"Git," said the patrolman.
â¢ "Nit." - replied the newsboy. "Schmitz is
me friend. De Supervisors and me ls solid'
and de Police Judges I has under me t'umb.
I don't have to move for no cop, so 'GUI'
yourself." â¢ . \
O'Keefe grabbed the "King" and was treat
ed to a rapid-fire verbal castlgatlon which
only ceased, when tha police - station was
reached. The majesty of thÂ« law hafl been
belittled and the law's representative Insulted.
What the law will do will be seen In the Po- â¢

This is m line with the undertaking
to simplify all the public school
courses. It ls the Intention of the Su
perintendent to make the night school
course more practical. To this end
classes in literature, drawing and
music will probably be dropped and
the night school work confined to
"bread and butter" subjects, as was
said yesterday by one of the deputy
superintendents. The night" schools
are called upon chiefly to furnish in
struction in elementary subjects, such
as arithmetic, the great majority of
the pupils being young people who
have to work for a living and need
such training to fit them for -their
employments. They have no time for
the non-essentials. Many of the pu
pils are foreigners who seek instruc
tion in English. Hence the plan to
revise the course in the direction of
greater simplicity and larger attention
to the rudimentary English branches.
The conference yesterday determined
only general lines of revision; and It
will require some weeks to work out
the details of the proposed changes in
the night school course.
The last of a series-^>F"lwelve con
ferences by Superintendent Langdon
and his deputies with teachers from
the public schools regarding Â¦ the re
vision of the courses of study . was
held yesterday afternoon. The teach
ers in the night schools were present
and the question considered was the
simplification of the 'night school
course.

Later Attorney George D. Collins
applied to Judge Cabanlss for war-.
rants for the arrest of the officers- who
had been arresting inmates of th.9
premises, but the Judge did not Issue
them. He. however, warned Captain
Duke against making any further &m
rests.
The respondents, he said, had made
three points. One was that Hutton.
not being a party to the suit., the court
had no jurisdiction over him. but he
had already decided against that',coi,
tention. Another was that as aa ap
peal had been taken to the Supreme
Court against the permanent Injunc
tion, the court had xio righ't to issuo
the restraining order. The Judge held
that this contention was ridiculous. -ia.
In that event he would have no power
to cite any one for contempt. The
third was that the warrants were
valid, but he held that they were not
valid, as the person, was not described
In accordance -with the constitution.'
If an entry had been made to thÂ«
premises on the warrants there would
have been an act of contempt* of court.
Judge Cook rendered his decision
yesterday on the motion "made on" be
half of PÂ»lice Corh,rriissioner Hutton
and Chief Wittraan to dissolve the or
der restraining the -police from serv
ing the forty-two . warrants obtained

When Manager Dugdale called the
roll, he discovered that Drennan and
Francis were out of commission. . What
could he do but put two pitchers, But
ler and Druhot, in the outfield. Then
Just to make it worse again, the Port
land magnate trotted out a pitcher, :
Connors by name, to mystify the stars
from Oakland.
He was the limit and had to be sent
away after the second Inning. Druhot
was put into the box then and Con
nors took his place in center field. The
first thing Connors did was to let
Schlafley's long fly soar over his head
and roll to the center field fence for a
home run.
Oakland had the lead in the fourth
Inning by a score jtt 4 to 1. " But the
Brownies began to awaken finally and
ere long they .eased three tallies
through the lines. and tied up the re
sult. But at that they could not play
good ball long enough and In the sixth
inning Murphy refused to cover first
base on an easy double play and so
Oakland landed with the run that won
for it the game. â¢ ,
Buchanan was lambasted pretty hard
at times; but, as usual, Portland could
not travel on the bases. It^took at
least three hits to bring in a run.
After the fifth round Buchanan got
into the game and the Browns were
powerless with the bat. The only real
good chance they had was lost in the
ninth Inning, when with two out and as
many on the bases, Murphy fanned.
Buchanan made a new season's record
by winging twelve of Brownies out
on strikes.- The score:

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
When Joe Long and Walter Moi'eno
had completed their little four'ruunda
of mixing and Jumping about last night
there was nothing left for the judges to
do but award the victory to the first
named. The fight was his from'th*
moment the initial punch was aimed.
He used his left and fight hook occa
sionally to gpod advantage and won
the fight by clean, clever work.
The men ,were the. stars' of a six*
bout show under the auspices of t the
Bay City Club and Mechanics* Pavilion
Annex was well filled. Long was in
good shape, much better in fact than
most of his admirers anticipated, lie
commenced lh the first round by goins
iff with a" rush an& bringing his left
up. Moreno was powerless to stop the
rush and Long kept landing time after
time in this manner. The second round
brought about no change. Long holding
his lead arjd Jabbing. Moreno at eVery
opportunity.
' Moreno's left " eye was closed early
in the round by a left hook. ThlÂ»
bothered him and Long took advantage
of this fact; Moreno started to rush
in the third, but he could not- land an
effective puncft. The Tourth' was the
fastest round of t"he night, and in every
mix-up Long triumphed. :
Jack O'Brien, the South Side waT
loper. took Abe Label's measure in a
hurricane four-round mill. " O'Brien's
left bothered Label and .for three
rounds he had the fight all to himself.
Label tried hard for a knockout in the
final period and punched O'Brien bad
ly on the head. The lattef*s lead, tow
ever, "was too great and he was handed
the palm of victory.
â¢Arthur Oliver, a husky negro, beat
Ben. Price in four rounds, because the
latter refnsed to fight.' Tdmmy West,
a clever 110 Dounder, made Jack Coo
gan Quit in two . minutes. â¢ "Telegraph
Hill". Jack O'Brien .stopped "Chick."
Lawler in two rounds and Pat Kellly
was given the decision over Ed Srrrtth
after four .rounds of good, fast milling.

second was the best he could do. Bond
age came on in the stretch and beat
him a length.
CHICAGO, May Sl.-Old Boney Boy
has at last broken down. This one
time good racehorse, owned by "Pa"
Bradley, has probably run his last race.
No horse racing on the American turf
lias faced the barrier more. times than
this son of Blitzen-Sue B. For six
years he has raced over all kinds of
tracks, in all conditions and in all
kinds of weather. Having practically
worn out his usefulness on the flat,
Bradley sent him over the Jumps, and
in the East this spring he stuck to his
task in these timber-topping events
just as he had done for four years on
the flat and defeated some of the best
Jumpers in the East.
To-day he made his first appearance
at the local tracks this season in the
short course steeplechase, the feature
of the card at Hawthorne. Naturally,
out of sentiment, he had a good follow
rng, and he took the first two obstacles
well up. Then he stopped suddenly.
Seaton dismounted and the old horse
/imped along on three legs. The left
fore underpin had given way and he
was plainly a badly broken-down thor
oughbred. "With him out of the way,
the real contest was left to Itacatlara,
Handvice and Ceylon, and they finished
in that order.

GRAVESEND., May 31.â Owing to
the radical change 4n the track at
Gravesend because of the heavy rain
storm, the long run of favorites which
had almost bankrupted the bookmak
ers, was checkedâ whether temporarily
or not remains to be seen. In race af
ter race the - first choice was beaten
until that consistent horse Hurst Park
came to the rescue and sent the play
ers of first choices home happy.
. No doubt there were several false
favorites, as was the case in the first
event in which De Reszke was pre
ferred to Ascension, notwithstanding
the partiality which the latter has al
ways shown for a heavy track. It was
no doubt because Hildebrand was on De
Reszke and Travers was on Ascension
that the .first -named caught most of
the play.
In the second race S. H. Brown's fine
Sir Dlxon flllv Wayward Lass was a
well plaved favorite, but she was
forced to pull up with second money,
although at one stage of the race she
seemed dangerous. Helgesen took her
wide and W. S. Fanshawe's Schula
mite, who was leased by her owner
from Clarence H. Mackey, came on
up the stretch a clever winner. Red
Fox, which opened second choice in the
betting, receded and did not impress
the critics. Results:

SEATTLE. Wash.. May 31.â Captain
D. J. Wheeler, who sailed the Pacillc
Ocean for a full half century, died this
morning in the Wayside Mission Hos
pital. He had taken a dose of whisky
mixed with opium and when discov
ered was too far gone for medical help.
For several years Captain Wheeler
was in the employ of the North Amer
ican Transportation and Trading Com
pany. Lately he has been out of work
and this, taken in connection with an
alleged fortune in Los Angeles which
he had been unable to get, brought on
despondency. At least that is the story
his friends tell. They say that Wheeler
had an interest in valuable property
in Los Angeles. About ten months ago
he sold out and signed a deed for his
interest, the stipulated price being
$16,800. Â¦ He is supposed to have sent
the deed to an attorney in Los An
geles, but never received the money. He
wrote several times about the matter,
but received no reply. Prior to the
trouble about the property Wheeler
was always of jovial spirits.
There is scarcely a sea-faring man
on the coast who has not sailed with
Wheeler. He leaves two daughters,
both of whom are married. One is the
wife of a Government official in Manila
and the other is in Hongkong, China.

With a soldier attached to one of

Patrolman Skain arrested her for

"You show no discrimination in
your treatment of the land and sea

Judge Mogan interrogatively.
"No, indeed," replied Miss Morton,
archly smiling. "I like both soldiers

.Charlie Stagnaro was attired in his

the band began to play at Stockton

Mr. Landregan was before Judge
Mogan yesterday on a charge of peace
disturbance and Mr. Cohn was the
chief complaining witness.
"He had been growling at me all

slapped my face with a .brush 'fllle.d

scratch on my nose."
(Nose exhibited in evidence as ex
hibit A and noted by Court.)
Mr. Cohn's story was corroborated
by Mrs. Travis and Mrs. Mitchell.

a quiet conversation, when sounds of
conflict in the dining-room were im

For two consecutive weeks the domi
cile at 914 Broderick street had been
in the hands of the renovators, and
during that, period the temper of the
chatelaine, Mrs. Clara Travis, was se
verely, taxed. To say nothing of, the
chaos that confronted her eyes
where'er they turned, her ears were
almost constantly assailed by an ex
change of unlovely language between
the boss painter, Ed L. Landregan, and
his subordinate,- Aaron Cohn. By vir
tue of his authority, Mr. Landregan
steadily ".nagged" Mr. Cohn, bestow
ing upon him such epithets a3
"chump." "rummy," "loafer" and
"work-dodger," all of which were as
annoying to Mrs. Travis as they were
exasperating to the person â¢ addressed.
So when Mrs. Mitchell dropped In to

' There were heavy receipts of new Potatoes
from aeroRS the bay and the river districts,
a'nd. although trade was actl\e. 'prices ranged
lower and the market was reported weak for
common 'offerings. Old Potatoes continued to
drag, -vlth sellers conceding to buyers all along
the line. Onions were plentiful, but ruled
steady under a good local and shipping demand.'
Six sacks o( Green Corn came In from Ala
meda the flrst of the season from that quarter,
and sold at 60c per- dozen. Offerings from
Brentwood brought 35c per doien, while Coach
ella lots were unsalable. Trade in miscella
neous vegetables was . moderately active, but
'supplies. of most kinds were . abundant and
prices bad a downward tendency. Liberal pur
chases of Asparagus for - canning account . at
4%@6c per pound held- that .vegetable steady,'
and extra fancy lots brought a slight advance.
Receipts of String and Wax Beans were heavy
and large lines had been carried over from the
preceding day. i Prices had a wide range as to
quality and poor lota were offered freely below

'prospects did not result In any accession, of

'the meager dealings and the halting and- nar

'no " essential change from Its recent- lethargy. -
The; .firm tone of the; London' market and '.the.
Saturday bank â¢ statement, whioh was called
favorable "by, tracers, were wqrth a' fractional
rise this morning whidh amounted to an av

to below last Friday's level. The nominal
cauxe". was the -ufii'nslon' of a firm on .the
Cotton Exchange, but. although the- failure
wa* -announced, as dire to a defalcation, with
'no bearing on' the market or financial condi-'
tlona. the . market failed ' to recover Its lost
ground. Neors of the day was not* Impnrtart,
but It offered seme, more favorable features
than for s'oipe time past. The market Ignored
these. The weekly crop bulletin of the W^atha?

had some effect in turning the downward slide
of railroad traffic in evidence since thft.jnlddle

last year's traffic has shown a declining ten
dency for revrral weeks past, and for the third
week 'of May the decrease has fallen to but
little more than 1 per cent. Net earnings uo
not'yet show a turn In the situation, retrench

CHICAGO. -May 31.â The break in May
wheat did iot come until near the close? jof
the- day's trsVlIng. The market opened weak
as a result or lower pjfees at July
started H@%c down at 85%Â©85%c. Senti
ment soon -chancnl. however. Figures con
nected with the weekly statistics of the inter
national trade were less bearish than they have
been for some weeks past, and excessive rains
had fallen In many sections of the Southwest.
The bullish reports tvera "the- Southwest were
partially substantiated by liberal purchases by
St. Louis houses and by -the strength. In that
market. The corn market here also showed
dtcided strength. In consequence an ' im
proved demand developed in the wheat pit. The
weakness with which trading began was not
only arrested, but was In a short time re
placed by a fair degree of strength. Oh a
good commission hous-> Â¦ demand July graually
advanced to 8Â«U*c. After the first hour .the
market experienced a long interval <if dull
ness, . transactions being Â¦ largely of a scalp
ing nature. The Question as to the size of
the outstanding short lines of May wheat had
acted as a check on many traders, but as the
session wore away without any sensational up
turn In the price of trtat delivery the convic
tion that shorts hod practically covered their
lin-'B gained ground. This resulted in large
selling In future deliveries, causing a weak
undertone. During the last half hour the
feature of trading was the wide fluctuations
of May, in which month, however, trading was
very light. After selling off to 85Vic July
closed at 85Â«Â»C.

PHOTOGHAPHS OF FILIPINO COM
MISSIONERS DURING THEIR
VISIT TO MARE ISLAND.
Other members of the commission
spoke in similar fashion.
Senfi'r # Gervasio^ Unson said: "Fil
ipinos suffer somewhat from want of
blood, nnd what they want Is to Im
bue the spirit of America and the life
of San Francisco into their country.".
R. B. Genato.,eaid: I was greatly

great gusto by the delegation from the
islands. During the repast the Yerba
Buena band played a number of lively
tunes.
PARTY* IS LIVELY.
The sail down the bay was full of
life and action. A large number of
the guests could understand English
fairly well and they all entered into
the general conversation. As they
passed the water front on the way to
th.e Union Iron Works they appeared
to be greatly struck with the size of
the buildings, especially the Ferry
1 building, the/ New Chamber of Com
merce building, the Fairmont Hotel
and the tall tower of The Call. At
the Union Iron Works they were re
ceived by Jwival "Constructor J. G.
Tawresey, Naval Constructor L. S.
Adams and President W. G. Dodd of
the Union Iron Works. Here they
manifested the greatest interest of the i
day and wanted to know all kinds of
things about, machinery and the dif-.
ferent equipments that went to make
the building of the huge battleships
now under course of construction there.
The party returned to the city and
landed on Mission-street dock shortly
before 5 o'clock. .
In speaking of.Urelr visit here, Simeon
Lux. ex-Governor of Batangas, who
speaks excellent English, said: "I am
â¢extremely impressed at the immensity
of the ITnioif Iron Works when com
pared with what I have seen in Ma
nila, 1 have never imagined that it,
could be so great and magnificent.
There is much display of power and
energy there. It seems , to me ' that
your people are capable of going every
thing that is in human power, to do.
I cannot express my feelings at wit
nessing such a great "display of 'powes*
and intellfgence. I can only ask of
you to allow me to express my "ardent
desire for the realization of the dream
of every American and of myself and
my companions that America may
.have a navy worthy of the energy,
power and Intelligence of her people.''
An elaborate-,* luncheon was then
served, ' w hlch was partaken of I with
Hon. A. W. ' Fergusson was the
first to go ashore. ' He introduced the
members of the^ party to the admiral,
who gave to each a courteous and
hearty greeting. The party, in com
panv of the officers, then went over
the "wharves, through the different
buildings and to all points of interest,
including the drydock: The visitors
were much interested in the dock,", and
had to have .its measurements and ca
pacity explained to them. From there
they were taken on board the torpedo-
Koai "destroyer Perry. The little sub
marine .torpedo-boat-Pike was brought
out, and went through a- number of
rrianeuvers "for -Ahelr edification. They
were then, conducted through the "offi
cers'.Quarters of the; post, while the
band, which had moved up to the band
stand, played a number of Filipino and
American airs. The visitors were then
conducted back to the Slocnm. â¢â¢ As the
boat sailed awayt from the dock the
band on board struck up "For They
Are Jolly Good Fellows," and amidst
a- great waving of hats by the Phil
ippine contingent, and a formal salute
by the navy" officers who were lined
up', on the dock, the Slocum' started
on -her return trip to' San Francisco.
GIVES COItDIAL WKIAXXME.
The visiting Board of Filipino Com
missioners was given a view of tht
bay, Mare Island Navy Yard and the
Union . Iron Works yesterd.a>'- The
members of the commission were the
guests "of the commercial bodies of this
city. All expressed themselves as sur
prised, please J and delighted at what
they saw. They were. particularly im
pressed with the btg plant of the Union
Iron Works and showed great inter
est in all the work going on there.
The party left the transport dock on
the tug Slocum at 9:30 o'clock yester
day morning, the 'boat having been
placed at the service of the commit
tee through the courtesy of Major C.
A. Devol. The run up the bay was de
lightful and the different points of in
terest were pointed out to the visitors
by the committee of arrangements.
T.hey took a lively interest in every
thing they saw and asked hundreds
of questions about the different places
they passed. As the boat swung in-to
the dock at Mare Island., the band of
the navy yard struck up â¢"America."
Immediately e.very one of 'the visitors
doffed his hat and stood bare-headed
until the last strain had died away.
Waiting to receive them was Admiral
Bowman H. McCalla. surrounded by
the following named officers:

The seven Justices of the Supreme
Court are J convinced that William
Buckley should^ die on the scaffold for
the dastardly murder of George Rice.
The contentions in behalf of the pris
oner were analyzed one by one. A pe
tition for a rehearing of the case^will
undoubtedly be filed, but in view of the
fact that there is not one dissenting
voice in the tribunal the chances of a
change in attitude of a majority of
the court are exceedingly remote. The
fellow conspirators of Buckley have
been convicted and their cases are now
before the Supreme Court.
i At the time of the machinists' strike
in the summer and autumn of 1901,
Rice went to work in a factory -near
the water front as a non-union man.
He was ordered to auit work by the
strikers, but refused to do so. His life
was threatened, but he would not be
intimidated. On the evening of Oc
tober 11, 1901, he boarded a car for
the Mission at the corner- of First and
Howard streets. At the corner of Sec
ond and Howard streets Buckley and
three companions also boarded the car.
Rice alighted at the corner of How
ard and Twentieth streets. He had
hardly touched the ground when one of
his pursuers struck him down from be
hind by a blow over the head. While
Rice lay prostrate and helpless Buckley
fired four bullets into his body, inflict
ing fatal wounds. Then the murder
ous quartet fled.
I Buckley was apprehended by the po
lice soon afterward on Seventeenth
street, and as he could give no satis
factory explanation of his excited ap
pearance was placed in the tanks. Soon
he was charged with murder. At the
trial Walter J. Platt, his daughter Er
llne Platt. and Arthur Cleve positively
identified Buckley as the man who shot
Rice. There was plenty of other cor
roborative evidence and the jury was
not long in coming to a decision that
the defendant could best serve society
by ignominious death on the scaffold.
Buckley's friends and sympathizers
spared no pains to save the criminal
from his deserts. and the legal fight
in his behalf was notably strong.

BURGLARS JN A SALOON.â J: Cereghlno.
saloon-keeper, 311 -Montgomery avenue, report*
ed to the police yesterday that burglars had
visited his saloon between 3 and 5 o'clock
yesterday morning and had forced open the
cash register, extracting |1O 15. Entrance
had been effected through the transom with
the help of a. ladder.
Frances T. Brown Tierney went to
Sacramento on the 18th of last month
with Matthew Tierney. proprietor of
the Occidental Cafe at 138 Mason street.
! There she became his wife. Yesterday
! Tierney filed a suit to have the mar
Â¦ riage annuled, claiming that when, he
i became a benedict and for two days
b'efore he was under the Influence of
,drugs and intoxicants. He says he
awoke to a realization of his condition
three days after the ceremony had
been performed and immediately left
his bride. Mrs. Tierney has filed an
answer to the suit, generally denying
all the saloon man's allegations.
A Â¦ suit for annulment of marriage
was also filed by Ada Lulu Simpson
Miller-Elchler against William Elchler.
The marriage took place February 29
of this year, and its annulment is
sought for on the ground that When
it occurred the bride was already the
wife of another man. It appears from
the complaint that Mrs. Eichler, sev
eral years ago, married a man named
Miller/ They Jived together for a while
and then Mrs. Miller left her husband
and went to live with her mother at
Â£32 Sanchez street. In the course of
time fIm met Elchler. and when he
proposed, she, believing Miller dead,
not having heard from him for four
years, consented to become his wife.
A few weeks after the ceremony Mrs.
Eichler heard that Miller was alive and
the occupant of a bed in a Sacramento
hospital. She visited the hospital with
her brother and, sure enough, . there
was Miller. She -notified Elchler of the
, discovery and immediately took steps
to have her marriage to him an
