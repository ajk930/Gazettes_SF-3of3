The Sunday Call Magazinestarting to his feet and striding^ out
"Do not move. I will lose no time."
He went away, and was gone, as she
thought," an interminable time. Dis
tressed to the last degree, the victim
of an agitation she could not control,
Esther rose from her seat and re
strained herself with difficulty from
following him. She counted the min
utes of his absence, and losing reckon
ing, she started to count them again.
The suspense was intolerable. When
the Count returned he told her with a
laugh that he had hot been a full min
ute away.
"Yes, yes," she cried, entreaty writ
ten In her pleadlng^eyes. "but Arthur,
my husband, what has happened- "
"Absolutely nothing, madame! It is
Just as I thought. The Prince had
gone to the station when you were ta
ken from the house. He. is perfectly
well and approves of what I have done.
You are to accompany me to Cadi with
out delay. He will follow as soon as
may be."
She would have said, "Thank God!"
but something: in the Count's manner
alarmed her; and ' searching his face
with her shrewd eyes she told herself
that he lied; and so she did not say
a word, but turned from him like one
who must be alone with her grief.
They found a traveling carriage at
Merens and a sturdy team of horses
to drag them across the pass. Esther
thought their progress all too leisurely;
but the road was steep and winding
and the hussars were in no hurry. It
was four o'clock when they quitted the
village, and half-past five when they
crossed the frontier, which divides the
kingdom of Cadi from the territory of
France. Here h,a.d been set up a guard
station, and formidable officials re
garded the traveler with not a little
curiosity, though neither by word nor
gesture 'did they offer her incivility.
The country itself was singularly beau
tiful and less rugged than that atibut
St. Girons. Gentle grassy slopes showed
many a picturesque chalet or grazing
herd. Cattle bells Jingled in the silent
.glades. The snow peaks were far away
like a haze of fantastic cloud be
neath an azure sky. Such travel
ers as they passed spoke of a sturdy
race, clean and quick and busy. Anon,
the pass carried them into the heart
of a forest where giant trees filtered
the welcome sunlight, and many a
knoll and thicket might have borne
witness to an English summer.
The Comte r de . Foix, . riding - by
Esther's carriage, did not fail to point
out the natural beauties of the pass
nor to dwell upon them patriotically. â
"It is a' wonderful country," :he said,
"and I wonder that so few English vis
it it me"'for Â¦aylng so, but

travel is concerned. , ...You go to , the
He did not appear to hear her, and
it was plain that he would not discuss
her history.
"Do you think I "should be sitting
here at my breakfast If. I. thought the
Prince was In danger?" he asked with
an honesty he meant to be transparent.
"You have been the victim of an im
pudent outrage; but the Civil Guard
will see that Justice is done. We make
short work with such fellows on the
frontier. The Civil Guard shoots them
patriotism. Our Prince has already
been too long away from us. I am very
glad to hear that he is returning."
She listened to him with eager eyes.
Arthur had already told her much of
his countrymen; but he viewed them
from another standpoint than this
flippant man of the world. The Count's
confidence, however, was greatly to
her liking. Even at the luncheon table
she would listen from time to time for
any sound upon the road which would
speak of tidings and the messenger.
She was not ungrateful to her compan
ion for his brave effort to divert her
thoughts and compel forgetfulness.
"I wish I could share your faith,"
she exclaimed dubiously in answer to
his repeated assurances; "but it is all
like a nightmare to me. Imagine it.
Count; I was married in Paris the day
before yesterday, and here to-day I do
not know whether my husband is alive
or dead." .
CHAPTER XV.
Arthur cf Cadi was too well ac
quainted with the character of hl3
countryjnen to doubt for a moment the
meaning of the attack upon 3t. Girons
or what the outcome of It was likely
to b3. No sooner had Martinez, the
steward, informed him that there were
horsemen at the gate of the castle and
that they were set upon an entry, than
he named them the servants of Fran
cisco Xavier and of that party which
was hostile to him in the councils of
his Government. None the less, his wit
was unable to say precisely what part
they had been hired to play; and while
he did not fear for his life nor for the
life of the woman he loved, he under
stood the hazard of the game and en
tered upon it with the courage of his
race.
"It would be. Alonzo of Vic-Dessos
and his band," he. said, leaping to hi3
feet and listening to the frenzied blows
upon the gate. "I had never thought
of that. Martinez. What, in God'3
name, do they want here?"
The steward answered with the quiet
cynicism which thirty years of that
dangerous servitude had taught him.
"They will tell you when they have
blown open the locte. Highness." h-*
said cynically. "Listen to that; they
are upon the drawbridge already."
It was at this' moment that Arthur
ran up hurriedly to Esther's room and
made such provision as he cpuld for
her safety. A. quick thinker, It oc
curred to. him at once that his old
enemy, the Duke, had struck this blow
with a Spaniard's subtlety and more
than a Spaniard's swiftness. Under
cover of these hired ruffians, whose
complicity could be bo Ifchtly pur
chased, he had veiled an attack which
opportunity elsewhere denied to him.
"As a friend of its owner," he said;
"you will be Interested in that place.
It is very old but very beautiful; the
house of a man who has done much
for Cadi. I am referring, of course, to
the Minister, the Duke of Montalvan."
Esther was greatly Interested. The
house he Indicated stood in a cleft be
tween hills with great woods In tiers
behind it and a pretty lake in the
hollow of Its park. Massive ramparts,
flanking towers, the keep and bastion
of a. castle justified its claim to great
antiquity. She wondered if Doctor
Xavier were there now. Her sense of
isolation was lost when she reflected
that she was at the gates of her bene
factor's house and that the night might
bring him to her.
"I should greatly like to see Doctor
Xavier," she said with animation. "It
is not a fortnight ago that he left me
in Paris. He was very kind to me in
England, as I think you know; I lived
more than six months in his house.
Of course, he would h~ very surprised
to see me. We said good-by like those
who will never meet again. Perhaps it
was not all so purposeless a3 it ap
peared. I have long ceased to think
about itâfor I cann"' flatter .myself
that 1 am the subject of Doctor
Xavier's Intentions. You would under
stand that. Count?"
: "I can admit nothing," he said cava
lierly. "The man who leaves woman
out of his calculations is a poor fellow;
his political arithmetic cannot be worth
much. Let us say that the Duke did
not consider Cadi quite as amusing for
you as Paris. He would naturally re
member that since you say he Is your
friend."
"I have believed him to be so. Count;
a friend to me and to my husband."
It was a direct. Invitation to him to
speak; but the old diplomatist skillfully
avoided the dangerous ground. Esther
..could detect hesitation in every word
he spoke. :'.".'.
"Cadi owes the Duke much," he said
â¢ reflectively,^--"perhaps her very exist
ence as a .nation. If she has>. been
saved from the French, it is Francisco
Riviera and the sirocco kills you, or
you hibernate at Biarritz and bewail
your gloom. Here in Cadi, yo-u may
take winter or summer as .you choose,
the snow on the heights, the roses in
f^ttie valleys. . There is no climate so
severe, none so 'gentle in the world.
Our invalids go five hundred yards up
to the hills and. laugh' at the doctors.
Consumption is unknown among us. If
a man coughs, he is a curiosity. We
are simple, gay, rich, hospitable to
strangers, and, as you will gather from
my words, . exceedingly modest. In
another hour you will see the city it
self; I hope it will be a surprise to
you; I feel convinced it will." â¢'
"At least, I hope to lind my husband
there," she exclaimed, caring little that
she interrupted him. "If Cadi puts an
end to my anxiety 1, shall always be
grateful to it."
"It can not fail to," ( he responded
gayly.
"No one is anxious in this country.
We shall not permit you to be the ex
ception."
She^ thought it to be an evasive an-
Bwer,- and was greatly harassed by the
persistency with which he ignored her
own position and the station to which
marriage entitled her. That his polish
ed manner concealed something from
her she had been sure since she quitted
Merens. Yet what it was or what subtle
conspiracy prompted his actions was
beyond her power to imagine. The
Count, meanwhile, had a hundred
stories to divert her and, presently
breaking off from them when they
emerged from the defile, he indicated
a house upon the hillside and asked her
to regard it particularly.
"It is my Uncle Jose who keeps the
Inn," she said, delighted at a chance of
airing a foreign tongue. "I have beeji
three years in England, miss, in Re
pent Park. Some day I hope to go
there r~aln. The English come to Me
rens when it is summer time, and I
speak to them. It is funny to hear
their Spanish, miss; they say, 'Si, Ei,
senorita.' and think .it means every
thing. Have you come from Garvar
nie? â no! Oh, but you should see Gar
varnie! It is the most beautiful place
in the world. And all the English go
there. Will you have hot water, miss?
Walt, then, and I will run!"
She raced away like a hare, glad to
be occupied, and mtrre particularly to
tell her friends below that miss was
really English. Esther meanwhile laid
aside her black mantillaâ the robbers'
legacyâ and when she had bathed her
face in clear, cold water and arranged
her disordered dress, she opened a fold
ing giass above the washing-stand,
and Â£0 beheld herself for the first time
Eince Phe had quitted St. Girons. The
change in her appearance both dis
tressed and surprised her. She had not
believed it possible that one night
could so alter or leave such traces of
its events. None would call her beau
tiful to-day, not even in flattery. The
ghastly pallor of her face, and the deep
black rings beneath her eyes, recalled
in an instant the Esther of seven
months ago, the Esther of the garret
and of the theater door. Nevertheless
she could not at tmce believe in the
truth which the glass disclosed to her,
and she said that such a punishment
of her imprudence would be greater
than she could bear. Was Francisco
Xavier but a charlatan after all! The
mirror could not lie. Esther buried her
face in her hands and. would not look
in the glass again.
This fit of despondency did not long
endure. There are depths of despair
which, when fathomed, leave the mind
calm and uncritical. Never from the
first had Esther wanted a woman's
courage, or proved herself unworthy
of that self-confidence, which is life's
Burest staff. Reflection told her that
no woman could go through what she
had gone through and come out' un
scathed. She was ill, weak, anxious.
Let there be good news from St. Girons
and the color would come back to her
cheeks, and the brightness to her eyes.
This Bhe did not doubt; and greatly
helped by her own good common sense,
the made what toilet she could and
went down to the calle a manger. Here
a tempting breakfast awaited her. Not
In vain had the little Spanish girl
epent six months in "Regent Park."
Tea was the national drink of England,
therefore it must be ready for the En
glish miss, and ready it was, poor yel
low stuff, boiling' and tasteless. But
the bread was spotless; the omelet, the
egtrs, the mutton, excellent. And to
these the Comte de Foix, who sat with
her, added words of good cheer. He
promised her to wait at Merena until
they had the news from the hills.
"It Is In my mind," he said, "that the
Prince was not in the house when these
rogues left it. Possibly he had gone to
the nearest post for assistance. If
that Is so, a few hours should bring
him to us. You must really make an
effort to get well before he comes,
madame. I have a great responsibility,
and it Is my duty to remember it.
Please to drink all the wine in that
bottle, and when you have drunk It I
will order another to be opened."
He pushed a bottle of white wine to
her, joining in her amusement at his
proposal. She was a little astonished
that he avoided discussing those events
of which she knew he was thinking
deeply. Here, as upon the highroad,
no mention was made of her marriage
to the Prince; and yet the omission
â¢was 6O discreet that she could not re
eent It. The Count displayed the ur
banity and the polish of a cosmopoli
tan. He had been much in England,
had raced his horses there, had shot
a Yorkshire moor, was a member of
half the Jockey clubs," and numbered
many acquaintances in the social
world. Esther could not help wonder
ing what he would say if he knew her
story, her simple life in the old
cathedral city, her bitter days of pov
erty and struggle. But she was quits
wise enough to say nothing about
them. She encouraged him to talk.
"I know all the cities cf Europe,"
he raid, with some pardonable vanity;
CHAPTER XIV. ,
IT was 12 o'clock when the
cavalry rode into the hamlet
of Mercns, and some quarter
of an hour later when Esther
herself arrived at tbe inn door and
was at once shown up to a splck-and-
Epan bedrocm upon the first floor. The
kindness of those into whose hands she
had fallen and this refusal to believe
that ill-news Â«f her husband was pos
eible had done not a little to restore
her strength; and although her wrists
were still red where the cords had
bound them/ and her cheeks had lost
their rosy color, her desire to be active
caused her to make light of these
troubles, and to assure the Comte de
Foix that all was well with her. The
inn itself stood a picture for the eye â
white and clean and conspicuous in a
pretty village. A little girl ,who had
crnce been in England, and was a great
celebrity thereby, attended Esther to
her room and could not do enough for
her.

"but, really, I would change none of
them for this little provincial town of
Cadi to which we are going". It has
all the advantages of Paris, and is not
one-fifth the size. When there is only
one playhouse In a city a man does
not spend an hour In the morning ask
ing what he shall see at night Those
who are fond of old buildings discover
that our cathedral is as ! old as the
Romans. I suppose it is an advant
age to have things very old. especially
when one is referring to one's female
relatives and their fortunes. In Cadi
you go to a Roman church at 8 o'clock
in the morning and to an English race
course at 12. There is 5 o'clock tea at
Dumine's, one of the finest restaurants
in Europe; and for a fortnight at least
in every year Jean de Reszke at the
opera afterward. Our women are the
prettiest in the south there are so
many, of them that we do not quarrel.
We have a breed of horses which few
countries can surpass. If you like rid
ing you will . like Cadi. Tell me
that you paint, and I will show
you Murillo's masterpieces for your
models. If you sing there Is Felipe
Marcia, who will give you the execu
tion of an angel and the abuse of a
Jockey. Our people are quick in their
affections, but changeable. We cry
'Viva' to*nlght, and hang the man to
morrow. Duels are to be arranged at
all hours of the day and night. You
can get a man killed for sixpence, and
buy the Judge for threepence-half
penny. Perhaps that is why we are so
happy. A careless race, readily victim
ized by an adventurer â such a people
is difficult to govern. It demands many
qualities In a ruler â will, flrmnesp, an
appeal to Its romantic side, singular
at eight if it cannot catch them; a
rope is all they get when they are
taken. Come, let us forget if we can,
and go out into the garden. I will
chow you the hills above Cadi and wÂ«
shall Bee my 'messenger coining over
the pass.". '..';.
His confidence was infectious and not
to be resisted. "She went with him to a
little garden behind the inn, and .there
beneath ' the Â¦ shadow of a plane tree,
coffee was served to them, and they
delighted "In such a panorama of height
and valley and fertile fields as only the
Pyrenees can, show.' In the village,,
below them, hussars were gossiping:
with the maids. or loitering before the
windowlesa shop. The door of a.
neighboring chapel stood; open,,
and the peasants went in and qut,
as the musical bells called them.: The
quiet and repose of it all would have
appealed greatly to Esther If her queÂ»
tion had been answered; but- it 'was
three o'clock before the horseman ap
peared at the height of the pass, and
half-pact three when he came clatter
ing _up to. the inn door. Â«. %
"The news is good or he would not
be in such a hurry," said Count,
She uttered a low cry and the veil
fell from her face. At the same mo
ment the carriage swept up to the
city's gates; guards surrounded it;
she heard many voices m arguments;
saw the lights and the life of the
streets beyond the barrier. But the
Moor had disappeared in the press of
the people. Esther knew not whether
he were friend or enemy. The shad
ows seemed to be closing about her
life. She entered her husband's city,
and it seemed to her that the gate
of some mighty prison closed behind
her as she went.
"I do not believe you." she replied
with great composure. "What has my
husband done?"
"He has married a foreigner, lady:
He has broken the law. Do not let
him return to his judges. They are
bringing you here because they know
that he will follow. Keer* him out
of the trap â they will kill him."
"That your husband must not come
to Cadi â I, Yussuf. know it. Keep
him away, lady; he must not come â
they will kill him."
She sat still, fumblins with the
veil about her face. From the first
this Moor had been a figure of !11
omen. Why should she pay any at
tention to such a madman's story?
Nevertheless, her heart beat quickly;
she felt that she must hear him to the
end. . ' .
Xavier who has saved her. I speak of
â¢matters with which you cannot be fa-"
"mlliar. There must always be one
dominating mind in the councils of a
government. A minority, of my coun
trymen has found that mind In the
person of the Duke de Montalvan. The
rest do not -think; they are children of
the sun, idlers, living to-day. An ap
peal to their Intellect goes for nothing.
You must appeal to their heart and
sentiment, and the scientific mind falls
in this. When the Prince returns, I
trust that we shall unite these factions.
His absence has been greatly resented;
but fortunately for him we have short
memories In Cadi. You 1 observe how
little I touch upon our merits, madame.
At the corner by the inn yonder I will
leave the city to speak for Itself, it
will not be very long now before you
hear the Duke in his own defense."
He spoke as one who would say.
"My duty is done"; and when he naa
reined but an instant to look bacK
at the road they had traversed, as
though to assure himself that none fol
lowed, he put his horse to the c ante j
and pressed on like one who would
overtake the leaders of the troop. The
cavalcade had entered a'pleasant wood
by this time, and many a shady glen
caught up the evening light and gave
an entrancing vista of grove and thick
et and the forest's heart. Beyond this
wood, where the trees opened out and
disclosed a stately avenue, there stood
a crazy Inn upon the hillside; and from
the plateau before its doors Esther first
beheld the spires and roofs of that city
wherein she was to suffer so much.
The sun was setting now. and It
flashed crimson stars from many a
window above the towering ramparts
and splashed with gold the lazy river
at the city's heart. The road itself
wound about the hillside like a silver
thread upon a field of green. Esther
could admit that the scene was a be
witching one, surpassing all that she
had imagined of Cadi and its capital.
The gentle hills, the bordering forests,
the multitude of houses, the spires and
turrets upstanding through the centu
ries, the hum of the busy life revealed
to her a world of which she had never
dreamed. And in this city she would
find the man she loved, would answer
those tormenting questions which
never ceased to present themselves. Of
other ideas she had none. Her own po
sition as the wife of Cadi's Prince must
not be remembered, nor would she per
mit herself to consider It. Esther be
lieved that she was going to her hus
band and that to-night she would find
him. All else must give place to this;
her love was predominating.
The Count had left her at the crest of
the hill, nor did she see anything fur
ther of her escort until the city's gate
was reached. The night fell suddenly,
as ever in the Pyrenees. A cold wind
swept down from the hills; lights be
gan to twinkle in many a homestead,
the Angelus rang out from every stee
ple. As the twilight deepened and
shadows fell across the road, Esther
became aware that some one had rid
den up to her carriage, and when she
turned her head, thinking it to be the
Count, and wondering that she had not
seen him fall back, she perceived, with
no little alarm, the white bernouse and
the ill-omened face of Yussuf, the
Moor. Very surprised to find him in
Buch a place, and, it may be, not a lit
tle alarmed, she wrapped" her mantilla
more closely about her face and sat
back in the carriage to avoid his
glance; but he rode up boldly to her
side, and bending over from the saddle
of a great black horse, he insisted upon
being heard.
"It is I, Yussuf, senorfta; please to
listen."
"What do you want with me?" she
criedâ "why are you here?"
"Because I am your friend, lady."
"Yes. yes; then what do you wish
to sav?"
You must came back to the house witlivT;
"What!â to see you hanged. Do you ~
know that if I raise my voice I can
bring the guard? Let me give you a
little advice, Ramon of Vic-Dessosâ
Arthur said at once that his marriage
was the key to this open declaration
of hostility. That they would, if they
could, â¢ carry him to Cadi, there to
answer his enemies in the city, he
never doubted; and it flashed upon him
that he must outwit them at any cost,
even at the cost, aa it would appear, of
cowardice and flight. Thi3 was in his
mind when he commanded Esther to
lock her door. If he could but reach
â¢ the guard at the post upon the sum
mit of the pass, this bandit's crew
would get short shrift and the rest
would bo easy. Thus it came about
that, risking all upon a su
preme venture, he fled from the
house to - the stables. and brid
ling the first horse he found
there he leaped upon his back and set
him at a gallop for the station en the
heights. Such a counterstroke was
not within the calculations of Alonzo
and his fellows. They had posted a
man at the stable sate, it is true; but
a slash of the whip across his face
sent him flying: from his saddle and
before he could recover himself
Arthur was a hundred yards up the
pass, and. roused by the outcry, hlsÂ»
enemies raced after .him In hot pur
suit.
An inexpressible tenderness toward
little Esther was the first Inspiration
of this wild ride. Since first ho saw
her in London, nearly seven months
ago, Arthur had found her different
from all other women: had been aware
of a mutual sympathy which waxed
strong with the days and had cul
minated in complete abandonment to
the Impulses of a passionate affec
tion. If he had wronged her.
love must plead for him. At the
worst, he thought. Cadi could refuse
to recognize his marriage and leave
him his liberty. They would be exiles
together, caring nothing for that
which they had lost. This reality of a
momentous night brought home to
him in an instant the deeper respon
sibilities he had ignored. He began to
perceive that he was face to face with
an ambitious and a relentless enemy,
with one who could stand at nothing
which opposed his ambitions and hia
ends. Arthur knew that he himself
possessed none of those gift3 which
make the subtle statesman or the suc
cessful diplomatist. He had only a
man's good courage, a birthright to
the affection of his people; but these,
he said, might yet suffice. A certain
joy of that antagonism filled him as
he galloped wildly up the pass. He
knew that a woman had roused him to
effort at last. The oM indifferent life
was done with; he would remember
his manhood for Esther's sake.
We have said that a number of the
hlllmen followed him upon the pass;
hut of these several quickly abandoned
the pursuit, leaving such glory as was
to be got' to their more courageous fel
lows. The perils of the road might,
indeed, have deterred men of sterner
courage, for it was often but a bridle
track above the gorges, a ribbon wind
ing about the higher peaks. One stum
ble upon the snow, one false step, and a
man would have gone headlong down
five thousand feet to an unknown
grave in the black abyss below.
Arthur, a horseman from his very
childhood, cared nothing for the d;in-^
ger. The snow flying from his horse's
hoofs, the black shadows, tho cries be
hind him, braced his nerve an to sonia
combat of which the prize was liberty.
Yonder, high up above this world of
silence and the night, there flashed the
lights of that station which was
his goal. Let him reach its doors, he
said, and Francisco Xavier were an
swered indeed. He called to his good
horse and laughed at the sounds be
hind him. And yet they were draw
ing nearer â that thud of hoofs was
more clearly to be heard; the race
v/as not won. It had scarcely begun.
He had taken a horse at hazard
from the stable, Ignorant that the
beast was one of those which had
drawn the carriage from Foix that
day. Already overdriven, the rigors
of this road left it so utterly exhaust
ed that it3 brave gallop degenerated
anon into a mere canter and ultimate
ly was little beyond a trot. This
alarming truth came to the rider sud
denly at the very moment when he
was flushed with success, and drawing
rein because he must, he began to
think that the game was with old
Xavier after alL There below on the
winding road the first of his pursu
ers emerged from the shadows. Ar
thur knew not how many followed
him from the castle; but he perceived
that flight would help him no longer.
and saying that he would sell his life
dearly, he permitted his horse to walk
and so waited for the men.
This relaxation of effort brought
with it a clear understanding: of his
position and a darker side to a mental
picture from which he could not turn.
His quick survey of height and gorge
failed to inspire him with an idea.
Upon his left hand the rocks went up
sheer to their snowy peaks In the
azure above. No eye could find the
bed of the gorge below him. The
winding road shut out that flash of
the station's lights which so cheered
him five minutes ago. He believed^
that the end must be here and wheel-^l
ing his horse regardless of the peril,
he prepared to meet it. It was a mo
ment of intense- suspense, for he was
sn unarmed man and he believed that
many followed him from the house.
An intent ear, magnifying the echoes,
said that numbers trod the path. He
could scarcely believe hl3 eyes when
but one man emerged from the shad
ows and halted prudently. He was
but an advance guard, he thought â
and yet he was alone. As for the fel
low himself, he appeared to be a bur
ly hunter, thick-set and bearded. He
carried an old shotgun slung at his
waist, showed a belt brimming over
with pistols. Stumbling upon hia
quarry it were difficult to say whether
he were the more surprised or afraid.
"Halt there!" he cried with sham
bravado; "halt there, or I shall cer-
Arthur laughed contemptuously,,
and deliberately taking a cigarette
from a little gold case, he lighted it
and blew a cloud of smoke on the
still nlsht air. The moonlight showtd
the figures of the two silhouetted
against the silvered rocks. The silem-f

Esther's carriage drove through Its
busy streets. It was the diner's hour,
and many a window disclosed an ani
mated scene, many a restaurant re
minded her of Paris. The avenue they
followed deserved Its title "boulevard."
Cafes and restaurants abounded- on
" either hand, electric trams flashed by
crowded with a prosperous poor re
turning to their homes. There were
broughams which might have appeared
without shame in Bond street, smart
phaetons hurrying from the parks,
well-dressed men and women walking
abroad as upon a summer's night. The
air itself blew soft and fresh, such an
air as one might breathe In England
upon a night in spring. Esther had
heard much of this city, but the reality
filled her with amazement. Spain, the
books told her. was an exhausted land;
Its people sunk in wretchedness and
bigotry, its ideals gone. Its art dead.
This mountain city, thrusting itself in
es a wedge between France and Spain,
gave the welcome lie to such an ac
count of Arthur's kingdom. The gar
ish shops, the stately houses, spoke of
wealth and luxury. There were
churches which â¢ had all the massive
grandeur of a splendid antiquity, fac
tories, theaters, markets, tne solid wit
nesses to continued prosperity. Such
life and bustle helped Esther to enjjy
her own obscurity, and left her glad
that she v. as alone. From the moment
when the Moor had disappeared at the
western gate none challenged or ad
dressed her. The coachman drove dog
gedly like one who obeyed a distant
master; the hussars were left behind;
she entered the city like a Elmple tour
ist, and went on unrecognized to an
unknown destination.
Their way lay by the boulevard for
nearly a mile, and thence, quitting it,
carried them to a spacious park and ul
timately to the Prado, an open square
with a cathedral and a palace upon
either hand. Here Esther observed
with some Interest a gathering of the
people, which she imagined must be
waiting for the passing of some proces
sion or spectacle. It v.as quite out of
her thoughts that the idlers had come
together to witness her arrival in the
capital, anJ for some minutes she paid

I know. It is quite, quite Impossible!"
The child's brightness was infec
tious and Esther found herself dress
ing and laughing at the same time.
She was the better for her long sleep
and when she looked in the glass she
was astonished to find that there was
a little flush of color In her cheeks
and that her eyes were clear and
bright. The morning itself broke
clear and fine. A fresh breeze lifted
the misty curtain from the higher
peaks; the air was so pure and rare
that the distant ice fields shone like
so many beds of Jewels. In the val
leys below them hills and woods
caught up the freshets of the dew and
were radiantly green la the morning
light. Nearer to her window the
quadrangle of the palace showed Es
ther a company of Infantrymen brisk
at their drill. Sentries stood at every
gate â tall fellows in v.h!te tunics and
silver helmets; a military Stind played
in the great square byth? cathedral.
The people wore a- ffay air and went
with buoyant step; there was no sign
anywhere of that unrest which had
disturbed the city yesterday.
"They think the Prince will come
to-day." Marguerite said, as though
answering an unspoken question, "but

She heard the hour of midnight

one against a nation, but would not
be dismayed thereby. Her love was
so honest, so loyal, that for a lover'a
sake she knew that she would drink
the bitter cup to the very dregs. Not
heroically but logically she could per
suade herself that she might yet win
her own liberty and her husband's:
for she was freeborn, and he but tha
servant of his people. A fitful a\e^

was In London again. In Paris, la
Switzerland; she knocked at the
theater's door; a voice called her in
the hour of her distress; she recreated
her bower of roses, slept In the path
of radiant moonbeams, perceived the
face of the Moor and believed him to
be near her. This latter hallucination
no common sense could baffle. As tn
London, so here. In a city of thÂ» moun
tains, Esther declared her belief that
Yussuf, the Moor, watched her while
she slept, that the dreamy black eyeÂ»
looked down upon her from, the shad
ows, and that a silver lantern cast the
gold green rays ifpon her tired face.
Then as now the figure of the dream
left her unafraid. She could not *o
count for the faith which was In her,
nevertheless, since he had met her at
Cadi's gate she numbered this silent
Easterner among her friends, even,
it may be, desired his friendship. Tha
omen of the dream contented her.
She lay back upon her pillow, and
uttering a deep sigh she surrendered
herself to that spell she could not re

"Your desire touches me!" she an

so many friend3 of justice In one day
before."
"Madame," he said, "I thought you
would have been more prudent." â¢
She resented the suggestion of folly.
"Permit me. at least, to be the judge,
since I am the only one concerned!"
"Not so, madame: your answers to
night may concern another more deep
ly than you think."
"Then, since they are true, they shall
stand for him and for meâ If the truth
Is of any value in Spain."
"Madame," he said. "I will see th&t
It is so. Do not blame me because I
do my duty."
He stood aside and she perceived that
two troopers had come with him to
the door of the antechamber. What
ever their presence portended, how
ever greatfy It alarmed her, Esther did
not betray herself even by. a gesture.
"Tou will not be permitted to leave
the palace until the Council has decided
your case," the colonel resumed. "Those
are my orders, madame â I am sorry
that I must enforce them."
"1 do not blame you," she said. "In
England we are not so very muca
afraid of a woman."
'"I do not understand It; \ It Is all , a

the officers come , In."
He stared at her for a.moment with
cold, steely eyes, which seemed to ask
what such a . change of front might
mean; then, without a word, bade her
follow him. In an adjoining room she
found two men , seated before a great
table, with a single lamp between
them. They wore uniforms of dark
blue, their peak caps lay on a chair at
their side: one held a document in his
hand, the other a pen. When Colonel
Varez had left Esther with them they
subjected her for some while to shrewd
and puckered glances, and many min
utes passed before she was called upon
to answer. But she did not mistake
their vocation â they were police officers
she said. The man who spoke to her
put his question so abruptly and in
such a formal manner that she would
have laughed at him under other cir
cumstances.
"Your name -and age, if you please,**
he asked.
She started from a reverie and re
plied' with great composure:
"Since I bear my husband's name, I
call myself Esther de Medina Cell; my
age Is 23."
' Both the men looked at her with
heavy eyes which seemed to resent her
answer.
"Yes, that Is all very well; but your
English name, madame; we want that,
If you please."
"Then my name Is Venn â Esther
Venn, the daughter of Major Venn, an
English officer."
They wrote her answer down la
boriously with scratching pens. The
second question concerned her hus
-band.
"Be pleased to Inform us under what
circumstances you met his Highness,
Prince Arthur."
"I met him at the house pf my friend,
the Duke of Montalvan."
"You were the Duke's- secretary for
some months, I thlnk-*he employed
you,?"
"I was not his secretary: I was com
panion to his sister. It is true that I
helped him In his laboratory, but I do
not consider that I was his servant."
"The companion to his sister, but not
hia servant! And during your com
panionship, madame. you found the
means to become acquainted with his
Highness, Prince Arthur?"
"Not so; the Prince found the means
to become acquainted with me. He
was Introduced to me by Dr. Xavier."
"By whom, madame?"
Esther had forgotten that they were
not aware of the Duke's Incognito.
"By Dr. Xavierâ the Duke; really,
you are very stupfd!"
They put their heads together and
discussed it In a whisper. When they
had written three or four lines upon
the paper, one of them continued:
'â¢No doubt you saw a great deal of
bis Highness, madame â he was much
In your company?"
"I saw him once in London and three
times In Paris before I was engaged
to him."
"Permit me to Buggest that you lost
no time."
"You may be as rude aÂ«? you please; I
am quite defenselcr- "
"I beg to differ you; your an
swers are your besi ...ense. Be care
ful what you say, your words will be
.repeated before your judges."
"Is it necessary, then, to take all this
trouble?"
"It Is most necessary. We must un
derstand, madame, under what cir
cumstances you have inveigled his
Highness Into this absurd marrige."
Esther flinched at the base charge.
"When I am called upon to defend
myself, it must be before gentlemen,"
she said, hotly.
"Then you refuse to answer?"
"Absolutely."
He wrote it down upon the paper, ap
parently pleased at her obstinacy. The
next question concerned the place of
her marriage.
"We understand that a ceremony was
performed in the church at St. Eus
tache. â¢ You are quite aware that such
a contract Is null and void in Spain?"
"I know nothing about Spain. From
- the little I have seen I am proud of
my Ignorance."
"We shall enlighten you, madame."
"Then please beg"In. You will find me
ft good pupil. I have much to learn."
"Remembering that some studies are
dangerous."
Â¦ "I do not forget it. Please to say
that I am an Englishwoman and that
I was married at the British Embassy.
Your judges will wish to know thatâ
I think they win be interested."
The men stared at each other a.lit
tle blankly. This was not the kind of
information they had come there to
procure. But It was written down,
nevertheless, in a flourishing scrawl
and with several blots.
"You were married in Paris, raa
dame, and you proceeded thence to the
castle of St. Girons. Was it your in
tention to remain there or to return to
your own country?"
"My intentions were my husband's.
They are still so. Really, you waste
time."
"We are not traVa hurry, madame;
there la plenty of time â perhaps more
than you desire."
"Am I to understand that you
threaten me?"
"If you compel us toâ yes."
"And with what?" -
He shrugged his shoulders.
"With Justice, madame." "^
"That must be an unusual punish
ment In this country."
"You are Insolent."
"No, I am truthful."
The Spaniard put down his pen an
grily. He was not quick at repartee
and he could nrt ripost such fighting
, thrusts. Defeated and chagrined he
sa^ for a little while silent? then tak
ing up his pen again, he proceeded:
"If you were set at liberty, ma
dame, would you give us your assur
ance not to molest his Highness
again ?" ' -
"To molest his Highness! â my as
surance? Do you know what you are
saying ?"
"Perfectly, madame; we require
your assurance."
She rose from her chair with calm
deliberation. Her face was crimson,
but the shaded light did not permit
them to detect it. *
"Then you shall have_ it â here and
now: that I decline to" answer you
another word!"
Her temner left them amazed. She
had crossed the room to the door' and
tried to open it, but â¢ it was locked,
and she stood there, tapping the floor
with her foot and In vain trying to
stifle her emotion. The two, mean

Marguerite turned away her face.
"Yes, yes." she said; "but they will
not call you that in Cadi. Oh, I am
very sorry for youâ I cannot tell you
h$w much! If one loves, one knows.
Please let me be your friend; you will
have so few in this house."
"PJeaso tell me who you are, and why
have they brought me to this house?"
She was answered as frankly:
"I am Marguerite, the daughter of
Gustave Desjardins, the French notary
here. My father Is the Duke's friend.
We have apartments in the palace,
and he asked me to help you. I know
that you are In trouble, my father said
so. The people have been -coming to
the palace all dayâ the soldiers send
them away. There have been dreadful
things Mone. They killed Ferdinand
Moretz in the market place this morn
ing. He was Prince Arthur's friend.
The newspapers say it is a revolution.
I cannot tell you everything. I should
be afraid."
Esther said she wished to be told.
"Do you know. Marguerite, that I
am Prince Arthur's wife?"
"I am sure you must be tired after
your Journey," she began. "It is such
a long way from Foix, and the roads
are so bad. Won't you come upstairs
at once? Your room is quite ready."
Esther was not sorry to escape the
prying eyes which watched her from
every side of the hall, and she went up
stairs very willingly. The bedroom to
which Mademoiselle Desjardlns Intro
duced her was almost as cold and bare
as the stone corrlder she had left. A
bed of ridiculously meager proportions
lifted a huge canopy of carved wood
almost to the ceiling. The dressing
table was in gilt, stiff and pretentious.
A Louis XV mirror above the fireplace
reflected the back of a marble clock
and of candelabras without lights. The
wardrobe was In satinwood. exceed
ingly handsome, but out of place. A
single strip of carpet, new and ugly,
covered a few feet of the parquet floor
at the bed's head. A glass chandelier
with unshaded electric lamps diffused
an unbecoming light. There were
painted figures upon the celling, but
damp and dirt had almost effaced their
outline. The one merit which the room
possessed for Esther was the fact that
she might call it her own; and no
sooner was the door shut than she un
loosed her wrap and sank Into a chair
with a sigh of deep relief. Mademoiselle
Desjardins, in her turn, did not attempt
to disguise anything. She stood at
Esther's side and quickly declared her
self.
"I am sorry for youâ indeed sorry!
Is there anything I can dor*
Esther brushed back the hair from
her face, and tried If It were possible
to understand her presence In that place
and the significance of her â¢ reception.
"Why should you be sorry for me,
mademoiselle?" r" asked disingenu
ously.
He turned to introduce a young girl,
who waited at his side â a mere child
she was, but indisputably pretty.
"This is Mademoiselle Desjardlnsâ
permit me to make her known to you."
Esther liked her face, and felt lest
strange for her presence. Mademoiselle
Desjardins herself did not hesitate ta
make advances.
He bowed and avoided the charge.
"The Duke will speak for himself,
madame," he said. "Meanwhile, every
thing in this house is at your disposal.
Please to follow this lady. She will
wait upon you."
"I have no alternative but to obey
you. The Duke, your master, can
scarcely wish to put any fresh affront
upon me. I am in his power, but I am
an Englishwoman."
â¢no attention to the group, nor asked
herself what Its presence signified.
Such Indifference the crowd did not
long permit her. Running with the
carriage, the outposts of the mob anon
began to Jeer and mock her, some cast
stones which rattled In the wheels
even well-dressed loiterers pointed a
finger at her and seemed to approve the
outcry. It was so sudden, so unlooked
for, so cruel, that Esther had scarcely
time to be afraid. The hussars coming
up at a gallop closed about her car
riage and beat the ruffians off; she
sank back, asking what it could mean
or what she had dont to these people
that? they should judge her so harshly.
Iron courage alone can stand against
the hostility of an angry mob â and
Esther, brave as she was, felt her
heart sink within her. Of what was
this the' omen; what fate awaited her
In the city which could so receive her?
The future loomed dark. Indeed â she
remembered that she was but one
again a nation, a helpless girl in the
hands of men without heart or scruple.
The hussars had come up at the first
alarm, and their presence. If it did not
quiet the rioters, at least left them
with no better weapons than their
tongues. Hissing and hooting, they
stood to let the carriage pass into the
quadrangle of the palace, and even
there Esther could hear their sav
age cries like the murmur of some
human storm drifting away upon
the breezes. Her own interests,
however, had passed to those
whom she must now face and to the
news which she believed awaited her.
The building at whose gate she stood
was of immense size, square in design
and freely decorated with canopy and
statue. A blaze of light shone out
from an open door; she perceived a
group of officers in uniform and al
most before her carriage had stopped
an elderly man, whose cuirass and hel
met were of silver, stood at her side
and offered her a frigid welcome.
"This is the palace, madam," he
said suavely. "I am Colonel Varez,
and I am commanded by'the Duke, my.
master, to welcome you in his name."
She answered him with dignity, for
she was determined that she would
show no fear.. She had never lacked a
certain stately grace of act and speech
and this did not desert her when 6he
permitted the colonel to help her from
the carriage and then followed him up.
a flight of stone steps and into a great
hall beyond. The barren grandeur of
this vestibule chilled her as with a sud
den breath of the night air.
Not a carpet, not a picture relieved
the monotony of Its marble decorations
nor save color to the cold stone in
which its many statues were chiseled.
Esther declared afterward that it was
as though she had blundered into the
hall of some national museum and
there had found herself face to face
with a whole army of obsequious foot
men who advanced together and bow
ed at her approach. Nor could such
homage deceive her. From the mo
ment of her arrival at Cadi's palace to
the final hour cf her sufferings there
she did not mistake the treatment she
received there, or fail to estimate its
meaning. Her humiliation would have
been* absolute, perhaps insupportable If
she had not reflected that It must be
brief. Belief in her lover sustained her
to the end. She answered the colonel
without fear or shame.
They rode back to St. Girons to
gether, recklessly and ignoring the
danger. A cobbing dame met them
upon the threshold and related, with
what coherence she could command,
the story of Alonzo's flight. Martinez,
the steward, showing a gaping wound,
added his tale and besought his mas
ter not to leave the house.
"It Is a trap. Highness," he said,
-nothing but a trap. Do not fall Into
It. You have enemies in Cafii â why for
get It? In God's name, I ask you to be
prudent."
Arthur answered them by ordering
a horse to be saddled.
"I ehall follow my wife," he said,
â¢let the road carry me where it will."
slipped risht under his enemy's body.
The trick found Ramon of Vic-Dessos
utterly at a less. Believing that his
antagonist was utterly exhausted, he
made a supreme effort, hurled his body
forward, lost his balance, and plunged
headlong to the depths with a lingering
cry. Arthur watched his body, it
seemed for an age. bounding from crag
to crag, until it fell bent and broken
into the shadows of the pit. Then,
reeling and dizzy, he turned to call his
horse. The captain of the station.
called out by the pistol-shot, answered
Arthur spoke and acted like one who
enjoyed some paltry Jest; his contempt
provoked the hillman to a frenzy of
rage and panic. Vainly he bent down
from his saddle and would have
.gripped his antagonist by the throat,
but sure hands kept him back; he could
feel them like Iron about his ribs, and
his startled horse plunging forward he
fell heavily upon the very brink of the
abyss. An arena more hazardous never
invited wrestlers to the contest â upon
the "one hand the rocky wall, upon the
other the frightful precipice. Of
this, however, neither stopped to
think. They were locked together
henceforth, arms binding arms, nails
gripping the flesh, sweat upon their
faces, their muscles like cords; feet,
loins, and thighs wrestling for the mas
tery. Life was the stake they played
form â Ramon of Vic-Dessos, that the
guard might not shoot him at dawn;
the Prince, that Esther might not wait
for him in vain. And eo they rocked
to and fro. now against the sheer wall,
now so close to death that one touch
would have sent them do-.vn together.
Jagged rocks, uplifted in the cascade
below, awaited the issue. One would
feed them anon.
It had been plain from the first that
. the peasant was the stronger man; and
that If his grip had been eure, his
strength must soon prevail. But Ra
mon of Vic-Dessos had been taken at
a disadvantage, and having but little
purchase upon his antagonist, he could
but force him toward the abyss by that
'cheer strength which the mountains

in the face, and a death terrible to con

say, that he should think less of what
such an end might mean than of the
home he had quitted and the young
wife waiting for him there. So much,
in truth, could the name of Esther
nerve him that his wits were with him
tÂ« the er.d; and even when it seemed
that nothing could save him from the
abyss, he remembered a trick he had
learned in the Sal'.e d'Armes at Paris,
and had the courage to employ it. Ex

he was clumsy and maladroit, and a
heavy blow from the butt end of Ar

3Night had fallen upon the sleeping
city, a glorious nifeht of a southern
winter, with an azure heaven of stars
above and the gentle breath as of a
summer eve upon the shrouded earth
below. In Cadi itself the unrest which
had troubled the capital for many days
appeared to have subsided. The va
garies of parties ended for a moment
in a truce of doubt. None believed. that
the Prince would return. A higher
tribute was paid to his wisdom.
This had been the state of things
CHAPTER XVIIL
and at the gates of: the citadel. The
cafes took down their shutters and
lighted their lamps; throngs went
hither, thither, singing national aira
or crying for the Duke;. the tocsin bell
in the cathedral tower boomed out its
deep and heavy note. And this bell
waked Esther in the palace. She lay
for a long time wondering if it were
the morning call to prayer, or why,
If it were not, she had not heard it
yesterday.
. She was not conscious at first of
other events, nor did the omens reach
her ears. Tha*t deep, booming bell,
reverberating and mournful, prevailed,
above all other sound; and it was riot
until she had listened for many min
utes, her eyes shut and sleep still
wrestling with curiosity, that she dis
tingulslied the greater uproar, and be
came aware that the city waked. From
this moment a medley of alarms pene
trated to her silent room. Now it
would be a clatter of hoofs, a jangling
of arms in the square before the pal
ace; or again the bugle's blast and
the rolling of the drums. By and by
she began to distinguish the fervid
cries of the senseless mob. She heard
her husband's name,' uttered in deri
sion. She could distinguish the shouts
following many a minister on his way
to the' citadel. She was aware that
many cried for the Duke, and that
he was the hero of the night. If the
palace had accustomed her to the hys
terical attitude of this passionate peo
ple, nevertheless the hour and the cir
cumstance mystified one freshly waked
from sleep and forbade her to guess
the truth. J3he rose from her bed
under the idea, it may be, that she
had slept over long and that curtains
shut ouLtofthe day. When she drew
them back the distant panorama of
peak and pass was enveloped in
darkness, and she could not dis
tinguish even the icefields on
the summit. But the. city Itself
was like a great caldron, whence
tongues of golden light cast their Iri
descence upon the curtain of the sky.
A thousand torches now blazed In
the hands of the rioters. So brightly
was the . sky Â¦ illuminated that you
could follow the moving throngs from
place to place and Bay when they
halted and when they marched on.
And loud above air the- ur>roar one
name was to be heard. Esther turned
quickly from the window when she
heard It. Her dread of this had sur
passed all. She knew that Arthur had
come to the city â she believed that
he was already a prisoner.
The mob ran hither, thither, for
fully an hour, oftentimes without pur
pose or again rallied by the bibulous
eloquence of half-intoxicated dema
gogues. In the end. one of these led a
multitude to the palace, and^ defying
the' sentries by numbers, the rioters
pressed in to the" quadrangle and
grouped themselves beneath Esther's
very 'windows. 4 There, Avhen they
were not crying insults upon her name
they fell to cursing: her husband and
clamoring that jshe should show her
self to them. She had no knowledge
of the Spanish . language nor of that
patois, half French, half Spanish,
which was spoken in Cadi; but the
demeanor "of those who Insulted her
was. not to be mistaken. Their voices
i The mob had fled; reluctant as she
was to credit her ears, this miracle
was the truth. Drawn away by some
sudden and more 'potent appeal to
curiosity, the rioters flocked like sheep
toward the doors of the cathedral and
there, gathering In serried ranks, they
uttered a new name and waited for a
new face. { It was that of their Prince,
then riding to the northern gate and
proceeding under escort to the citadel,
and, asking why the people had gone
away, t she rose at last from her bed
and put on her dressing-gown. It was
very cold in her room, and when she
turned up the electric light, but three
globes of twenty were left unshattered.
The long windows opening upon the
veranda had been utterly wrecked by
the stones. Curtains were torn; tables,
chairs and carpet powdered with the
glass the volleys had crushed; but the
broken casement gave her a clear view
of gate and courtyard, and from that
place she beheld her husband upon his
way to the citadel, and, seeing him, she
understood the miracle.
It was a weir picture, distinct and
unforgetable. Countless torches, cast
ing their bountiful rays upon upturned
faces and looming .'buildings, and all
those serried ranks of expectant" people
gave a scene to whlcn night lent its
cloak of/ mystery. The tocsin of the
cathedral still rang mournfully; cries
rose and fell in the moments of waiting
like the murmurlngs of storm. ,But
clear above the figures of the multitude
were the horsemen In their gold cui
rasses, the pennons of the lancers, the
gate. Circumstances justified her worst
apprehensions. If the mob broke into
the palace she did not doubt that it
would kill her without pity. She
quailed before the outburst, scarce
daring to breathe or move. Anon
words were not sufficient for her ac
cusers and the mob ceased to be con
tent with curses and defiance. Some
one cried out that the palace would
be taken and upon this a volley of
stones smashed the heavy glass of the
windows and sent debris of jagged
glass and, splintered woodwork iÂ» a
shower about her bed. ,For a moment,
perhaps, she did not quite realize
what had happened so loud was the
uproar when the windows were bro
ken, but the crashing sounds, the cur
rent of cold air, the cloud of dust
within the room quickly undeceived
her. She had the idea that men were
climbing up the veranda and would
burst in upon her presently to take
her life. Stones rattled upon the case
ments like hail which a - tempest
drives; she could hear the thunder of
voices, raging and fearful, and this
ferocious hate affrighted her more
than the dread of death. Had the
mob been accusing an oppressor It
could not have roused Itself to a
greater fury than that which it now
vented upon a defenseless girl. Es
ther suffered" a torture of doubt so
enduring' that she did not believe any
mere physical pain would be com
pared with it. When the clamor
ceased as suddenly as It had begun
she â¢ hid her face In the pillow and
would not believe that such a miracle
.had come to pass. Her limbs were
cold and trembling. She thought still
to hear the voices; the darkness shap
ed new mysteries for her.

believe that his regrets were unreal. A
man of few words, he continued to re
peat his apologies, and so earnestly
that she accepted them without ques
tion.
"I have been more frightened than
hurt," she admitted candidly.- "Of
course it was very alarming. It will be
time enough to-morrow morning to ask
what I am to do. Please be careful or
you will cut yourself with the glass; it
seems to be everywhere."
He flung the door wide open and in
vited her into the antechamber.
"I will order them to prepare another
room at once," he said; "meanwhile,
since we are all so very much awake,
perhaps you would allow the Duke to
add his apologies to mine. He Is wait
ing in the salon, madame. He drove
here at once when he learned what had
happened."
The news was the best that Esther
could have heard. Her desire to meet
Doctor Xavier face to face had been
with her since she crossed the frontier.
Rightly or wrongly, she hoped much
from that friendship by which both
fortune and troubles had come to her.
Francisco Xavier would never range
himself finally upon the side of her en
emies, she argued; and so she followed
the colonel with confidence, not a little
excited and not a little glad. The sa
lon to which he conducted her was
light enough for her quick eyes, and
she recognized her benefactor at once â
a cloaked figure In the shadows. He
did. not rise to greet her, did not for
the moment appear aware of her pres
ence; but, instructing the colonel brief
ly, desired him to withdraw.
"I am engaged for an hour, Varezâ
admit no one."
The soldier saluted and withdrew,
and when the door was shut and Es
ther had advanced a little way into the
room, the Doctor put his hand upon a
switch by his chair and instantly
flooded the room with a blaze of light.
"Come here, camarade; come here
and let me have a look at you!"
Esther had never known what It was
to disobey him, and, despite the some
what brutal masterfulness of his de
meanor, she crossed the room and
stood before him, while he, throwing
himself back in his chair, regarded her
closely.
"Yes," he said slowly, "as I thought
âthe petals fall but the flowers remain.
Do you know that a month has greatly
changed you, camarade? Time laughs
at ' our little schemes, I see, and yet
time is sometimes wiser than we.
When politics give me time to return to
my laboratory, I will set down time
and trouble among my enemies." .
He appeared to muse upon it, clasp
ing his hands and upclasping them
several times before he could bring his
mind to the present circumstances.
"Let me see; it is not twenty days
since I left you in Paris!" he resumed
at length; "much has happened since
then, camarade â for one thing you
have been very foolish; for another,. I
have been premature."
Esther protested; the first word she
had spoken to him.
"Why. did you leave me?" she asked,
a little passionately; "why did you
bring. this trouble upon me when I be
lieved you to be my friend?" â¢
He had expected her reproach, but It
did not distress him. After all she was
but a pawn in the great game he had
It was all a rodomontade, false and
sham. Madame Julia had hot been to
church that morning, and no messen
gers had ridden out to the hills; indeed,
the deception was as childish as it was
unnecessary, although if achieved its
baser purpose of inflicting pain upon
Its victim. Had Esther known her own
mind less well, she might have suf
fered a certain humiliation in remem
bering how little worthy she was of
that station to which marriage had
lifted her. But this was far from be
ing the case.
"Doctor Xavier must come to me,"
she said firmly, "and I shall then be
able to explain everything to him. I
do not think you will prevent Arthur
riding in. What happens to me does
not matter at all. I shall try to do
my duty, Julia; it would be no com
pliment to your country to believe that
its men are cowards â at least, 'until
they prove themselves bo. There are
other ways of telling people in London
â perhaps I shall find one of them."
Julia could believe no such thing.
"You poor child!" she said, "how
little you knowâ how very little!"
With this and other vague consola
tions she took her farewell. Esther
saw no one else that day, not even little
Marguerite. The night found her
searching the distant hills with anxious
eyes. Would Arthur come? Had they
warned him? What would to-morrow
bring? She could not tell. Slowly but
surely the ordeal was robbing her of
her. will and resolution. She drew the
curtains reluctantly at last and shut
out that dim vista of the range and
pass which, stood up bo formidably be
tween herself and liberty. The palace,
itself, was as silent as the grave. She
might have believed, but for the sen
try's footfall, that ahe was the one
living being within it Â¦ \
much beloved here, but love does not
rob a people of their pride. The Span
ish faction chose Arthur's wife for him
a year ago; they wished him to marry
into the royal house. We knew that
they would be disappointed. If this
were a great European country, all the
nonsense they talk would be intelligi
ble; but it is only a province, child, not
much larger than one of your English
counties, and they are making them
selves ridiculous. The worst of it is
that while they are ridiculous they are
not the less dangerous. We are true
Spaniards in pride and temper, as Ar
thur will find if he puts his head into
the lion's mouth. I do not believe he
will do any such thing. Francis has
sent messengers to the hills, and they
will stop him. That was my prayer be
fore the altar this morningâ that our
friends may be in time. I dare not
think what would happen if he should
come."
He appeared to rouse himself to some
warmth of regard for the friend -who
was in danger, and Esther, reciproca
ting his interest gladly, did not fear to
be grateful.
\ "1 was sure from the first it -would be
that," she said, excited already by his
implied promise. "You did not coma
here to speak of hla past; you came to
tell me that you are hla friend. Every
thing else is waste of time. Arthur
has always such faith In you. I know
it will be justified! You can save him If
you will, Doctor Xavier!"
She looked him straight in the face
like one who would trust him without
question; but he could -not meet the
gaze of her ardent eyes, and she knew
then that aha had been premature.
"I did not come here to speak of
your husband's past â true," he said
slowly; "that will speak for Itself, and
It must be heard, camarade. Let us
continue with our confessions; they
may culdÂ» us to a better understand

that you had Interested a man whom
many women had tried to interest and
failed, I dismissed the observation as
a fallacious one. The circumstances.
I said, were unreal, the impression
false. You ask me why, and I will tell
you as bluntly. We are a superstitious
people and the vulgar among us find
our consolation In a lie. Our* religion,
which ia the people's life, conveys
many truths of human nature; one of
them la the truth of womanhood and
maternity which wo embody in that
gentle figure we call 'The Virgin of
Cadi.' From the earliest days until
this nineteenth century our painters
have vied with each other in beautify
ing that figure and perpetuating it. I,
myself, stand apart from superstitions.
I believe that they have their place in
the human scheme. I neither mock
them nor accept ihem. And yet I will
confess that there was a day in London
when, had I been a superstitious man,
I should have found an omen for my
guidance. H was the day upon which I
met Esther Venn in the manager's
room at the Casino Theater."
He paused as though waiting for her
question, but ehe answered nothing,
and he resumed:
He rested his arm upon the table a.n<3
searched her eyes with his own a3
though to catch her closest thoughts.
"I answer neither 'yes' nor 'no,* he
said frankly; "with any other than a
Medina Celi, I would have said 'yes.'
But I know men, and I am beginning
to know women. Let me read your
thoughts for you, camarade. You are
saying that I inveigled you to my
house. that this intrigue might help me.
Is it not so â ah, see how your sex be
trays you! Behold the conspirator
against whom such things are
charged."
He laughed softly at his own humor,
and, the bright light appearing to
trouble him, he turned out the lamps
again until but one was burning.
"No," he resumed, "it was not that,
my friendâ I pledge you my honor. I
took you to my house that I might
gratify a curiosity with which my la
boratory troubled me. I found you a
willing workerâ let it be admitted. You
have helped me to say that, under cer

lies within the reach of every woman.
To-night I go a step further and dis
cover how elusive that possession Is.
I say that twenty hours of trouble will
undo the work of many months. I

reason. I saw m$- country neglected by

duty has a greater claim. You, last of
all, will blame me for that; I am here
as a patriot â I have no other interests.
That is my story in a word. It Is a
simple story, camarade â as simple as
the story of your own misfortune,
which I am waiting to hear. Please sit
down and tell me all about it; I can see
that you are very tired."
She sat. as he directed, in a high
backed chair upon the opposite side of
the table. The light shone down npc-n
her face and declared its pallor. He
thought her beautiful even in her dis
tress; but the beauty was her own and
owed nothing now to his art.
"Since you know that my story is a
simple one, why do you ask me to tell
it?" she exclaimed, a little petulantly.
"We are not children, and do not wish
to deceive ourselves. When you left
me In Paris you knew that I should be

me as much â "
"Then my sister had done better to

rose and fell like the thunder of an
angry sea; they terrified her, made
her afraid of herself, so 'that she
turned out the lights, in her room,
and, crouching in her bed, tried to be
deaf to the uproar and to shut the
picture of it from her eyes.
No realization of its monstrous In
justice could blind Esther to the folly
of that day upon which she had given
herself to Arthur in Parish This
overwhelming, malignant hostility
opened her eyes arid wrecked the pret
ty logic, which had buoyed her up
since the gates of a royal prison
closed behind her. She began to Bee
now how great a wrong she had done
the man she loved by surrendering to
his will. These people, she said,
would have been loyal subjects but
for that act of theirs, which had so
hurt their' pride and destroyed their
ambitions. And to this was added a
great fear, a fear of things unknown
and passing experience. Esther be
lieved that the mob would force the
palace gates and drag her out. She
cowered in the darkness, silent and
afraid. Every sound within the pal
ace, the sentry's footfall, the rustle
of a curtain, the creaking of a board,
would set her heart beating wildly. It
occurred to her cuick mind that this
visit might not be so accidental as it
appeared and that her enemies in the
city might have sent. the people to the

Ing that help had come to her at last.
Her astonishment was great when she
discovered that her visitor was Colonel
Varez, anxious to apologize for that
which she had suffered.
"Madame," he said with unaccus
tomed eloquence, "I can not find words
in which to express my regret."
Esther had not liked this man, but
he had the air of an honest soldier, and
ahe would not do him the injustice to
helmets of the guards, and last of all
the figure of one who rode alone upon a
chestnut horse, and before whom,
meeting him thus face to face, his peo
ple fell to silence. Esther declared af
terward that she was conscious of Ar
thur's presence even before she saw
him. A passionate desire to go to him,
to stand at his side, to answer the peo
ple for him, mocked her helplessness
and filled her eyes with tears. Her
pride in him declared that he was a
worthy figure for the homage of a pop
ulace. Tall and manly, sitting his
horse. to perfection, his white uniform
catching the golden light, his demeanor
fearless and unconcerued, even the
multitude had the will to forget, and
many a voice which erstwhile . had
cursed now blessed him. Cheers broke
out and were with difficulty suppressed
by an obedient soldiery. Those who
had gathered stones dropped them
shamefacedly. Young men cried
"Viva!" and cared nothing for the con
sequences. The cavalcade swept by
unaccused by the citizens; but Esther
lingered still at her window as though
some miracle of the night would carry
her message to him she loved.
â¢ ' â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ . â¢ â¢
Esther made no reply. The duplicity
of which she was the victim could not
be hidden either by civil words or by
these almost- vulgar protestations of
good-wllL When Madame Julia went
"Would you have me to believe,
then, that marriage Is a question of
life or death in this country?"
"There are other charges. He has not
been true to his position. He spent a
whole vear abroad â they accuse him
of extravaganceâ even of treachery.
But you shall hear itâ I promise you,
you shall hear his defense. Ah, you
love him! and It will be a dreadful
thing to hear! But we must learn to
be brave: it is all that a woman-can
be!"
She had contrived In a few short mo
ments to insinuate that Esther must
euffer and that she was greatly
changed. Malice in the cloak of pre
tentious affection is ever an ugly thing.
Julia de Montalvan could not make it
pretty.
"So you are really his wife â yes, the
telegraph told us so. My brother pub
lished it at once in the newspapers. He
could not foresee that it would be so
dreadfully resented. Cadi is a little
kingdom, and its spirit is republican.
Imagine, my dear, the stupidity of a
free country which does not permit its
Prince to choose his own wife! What
does It matter if you are not of noble
birth or Spanish born! You have en
joyed my brother's friendship, and
that should, be enough. The city must
be lost to all sense of reason when it
behaves as it is doing â mobs in the
street all day and such dreadful things
done that I dare not tell you of them.
And now they talk of sending the
Prince to his trial! God help us all, I
say, and keen Arthur in the moun
tains! If he comes here he is lost!"
Esther turned the subject with, an
awkward question.
"I am relying upon Dr Xavier's in
fluence," she said. "Since it was
through him that I have brought this
trouble upon my husband, his honor
will compel him to help me. Were it
not for that, I should be distressed in
deed! But you must not ask me to for
get that the Duke is my friend."
Madame Julia took her handkerchief
from her eyes and looked at her a lit
tle suspiciously.
"My brother is the soul of honor,"
the declared. "You owe it to him that
you are here in the palace when the
Council would have sent you to the
prison. What he can do will be done.
You forget, my dear, that be has but
one voice; and that there are. many
against him. The Government will
hear nothing In the Prince's favor. It
says that his position does not put him
above the laws. My brother has worn
himself to a shadow In the cause of
friendshipâ it was such a dreadful sur
prise to him! He had left you in Paris
believing that you were going to be
very happy. You know how much he
valued your good opinion of him*â and
now it has come to this! Ah, my dear,
life is very cruel for some of us!""
"None the less," persisted Esther,
"Doctor Xavier can help me if he will.
I shall hope to see him here to-day."
"It would be madness for him to
come. He must not declare himselfâ
positively must not! What he can do
for you will be done when Arthur Is
triedâ for his life, my child; I fear it
is for that!"
She dressed quickly and breakfasted
in a small room of that suite of apart
ments allocated to her in the palace.
Little Marguerite had promised her a
visit from Madame Julia, and this
came about swiftly after breakfast,
when a servant announced the arrival
of madame herself, and that loquacious
personage swept into her room and em
braced her with the ardor of an ef
fusive race.
"My dear little Esther!" was her al
most "tearful greeting, "that we should
meet lÂ£ke thisâ that it positively shoVld
be you!"
Esther* suffered herself to be kissed
on either cheek; but ehe was not de
ceived by this clever actress, and she
listened to her hysterical chatter with
out emotion.
"I thank you very much," she said.
"Of course, I knew that you would
come."
Julia began at once to excuse herself.
"Ah, my dear child, that we should be
the cause of your misfortunes â we who
loved you so! I reproach myself bitter
ly! When I look at you and see how
greatly you are changed â when I re
member our happy days in Thonon I
hate myself for letting you go. But no
one would listen to me. I begged Fran
cis not to leave you in Paris â he would
not hear me! 'She will suffer for it,' I
said; I was wiser than he!"
Esther thanked her with a little
pressure of the hand and continued to
dress herself hastily. She did not dare
to tell this child how much those few
words of doubt meant to her. Her
own belief that Arthur would come
could not be denied â at the same time
she had but the vaguest ideas of the
laws wfliich menaced him or of the in
trigue which sought his downfall.
Destiny had caught her up in the
meshes of the net and nothing but a
miracle, she imagined, could set her
free.
Prince Arthur if they dared, but I
think he is too clever to come back
just now. The people will laugh at
the Duke if he does not come â some
of them laugh already. I shall run
here at once with the news if there is
any â I want to be your friend, dear
Esther!"
"Theygo'on a fool's errand!" was
the cry. "Some one has hoaxed themâ
wait and see! They will look foolish*
by and by!" But others said: "It i3
certainly true; for the Duke has rid
deji to the citadel." Â¦, The less probable
story gained ground every moment.
Excited both by the hour and the
event, a considerable mob' began to
gather in the market place and to

hand at a great many things. Including
architecture, painting, illustrating, pub

SINCE some politician or keen
brained newspaper- man coined
that terse phrase "with the lid
off" it has done service over
time In reference to everything from
Tammany down to a picnic of the
Journeymen street sweepers. In Its
latest application we see it advanced
as characteristic of the contents of
"Tattiings of a Retired Politician," by
Forrest Crissey. "This is politics with
the lid off." reads the publishers' an
nouncement. Accepting this on faith
as regards the thought in Mr. Cris
sey's work the reader may- well quali
fy the style with the conviction that
It Is Indeed literature "with the lid
oft." If the old Governor, State solon
and United States Senator William
Bradley, who delivers himself of the
.wisdom constituting "Tattiings of a
Retired Politician," is to be taken as
a type of American illiteracy in high
places then may we well fear for the
future of the Queen'3 English In the
high councils of the land.
- As, a reflection of the pure white
light of honesty and righteousness that
clothes things political, whether in city
councils or the halls of Congress, Crls
se'y's book Is instructive. With de
lightful Ingenuousness Governor Bill
Bradley recites tales of "holding up"
city corporations for franchises, of
"buying" legislation In State assem
blies and handing Governors a "sack"
on- "the- way low down." These little
anecdotes, which we are led to believe
are most of them closer to fact than
fiction, cannot but prove to be of real,
practical' value to our respectable gen
try of the lobby. Here, for example,
is a saw which serves the double pur
pose of pointing a moral and illustrat
ing 1 ' the graceful rhetoric of this ex-
Senator, old Bill Bradley:
"The man who lies down and goes to.
Â¦ sleep on the soft side of â¢ a Â¦ political
cinch stands a good chance of waking
up just In time to see his hide nailed to

"Rachel Marr,'.' provided one is not
foolishly . weak enough to permit of its
flocks and herds. The very cackle of
the hens and the full murmur of their
brooding; the mares and their foals;
a litter of tumbling, yelping pups, ex
cited her as greatly as the sound of
the 'sen, though to a softer, more in
explicable emotion. Little children
she adored; those who were childless,
she hardly knew; she rarely crossed
their over-quiet thresholds: she did
not pity them; they did not exist. A
woman of the village only became a
living creature . when she bore life;
when she renewed it. A baby was a,
miracle to her. * * ? Her dis
dain or hatred of the aged, which in
dexed marked her strongly, seemed
even at Its greatest something foreign
to her mind. It was rather an indiffer
ence than disdain, rather a fear than
a dislike; she was so young that the
old were aliens of another race."
So It is that to this young hedonist,
this worshiper with the .Sybarites,
.there comes the overwhelming love for â¢
the ascetic, the man of iron will, con
quering the lusts of the flesh. Rachel,
inheritor of a mother's passion, as she
is of it the "fruit, grows from innocence
to knowledge, from girlhood to woman
hood In the strength of her love for
this man of unbending purltanlsm. Out
of sheer fanatical love of flagellation
this Anthony â tempted beyond the
limit apportioned to his sainted name
sake evenâ marries a woman of Ehnv
eled soul and thus sets barriers up
against the great desire that is In him.
How this causes Rachel to lose every
grip on , religious belief, on honor for
the soul's high provinceâ this Is the
most dramatic portion of the story.
Loving to madness, knowing that she
is loved in return, yearning for the
consummation of her passions, this
woman, now woman only in body with
soul- dead, breaks down the barriers
only.after wild battling and finds her
reward linked with death.
Â¦i. Roberts has .given a broad, vital
background to his story, commensur
ate with the fierce play of passions
therein; With the careful attention to
detail of a Hardy he has put 'the little
fishing village on the Cornish coast
vividly before us, its people living and
full of the hard, raw elements of sky
and sea. Pictures of crackling storms,
of the Bwish and turmoil of the waters
and the changing cycle of the seasons
along rocky headlands make shifting
scenery for the dramatic action. The
homely life of the flsherfolk, with their
rugged sternness of precept and lax
ness of practice, gives color to the cen
tral plot of the tale'.
In one jrespect does the author show
lack of taste and in another a weak* Â«
ness â¢ of style. A higher sense of re
straint than that he has exerted would
have prevented his bringing the spirit
of his book dangerously near to the
typical Hall Caine quintessence of., sub

Under the caption "Penh's Holy Ex

count of the founding of Pennsylvania,
paying especial attention to the nature
of the colony's constitution and Its
many Impracticabilities born of. the
founder's religious and social beliefs.

Of course the disputes were in no small
degree based upon dislike of the mili

also the strong antipathy to expendi

material prosperity of the people. With
the breaking of the sentimental ties
that bound the people to the founder,
there was greater need for discretion In

honor for that his shipload of Swedes
was successfully discharged on a
Delaware shore in April, 1631, and the
little State-to-be was thus born. Then
came more Swedes and some protests
from the Dutch and from the English,
for the hardy Norsks were settled upon
land everybody claimed and nobody
owned. Then came troubles. Doughty

vessel load of New England Yankees

charged them forty shillingsâ the price
of the shot. Next Moens Klingr,~com

of eight men against Commissary
Hudde, the Dutchman, and cut down
all his apple trees. Comes then Jan
Rysingh. new Governor of New
Sweden, and signalizes his advent by
capturing a fort held by seven sol
diers. This story of the Swedes in
Delaware is brave reading.
After a review of the eveats leading
up to the occupation of New Amster
dam by the English, the author takes
the reader over the wider field of
colonization and furnishes a study of
the "migration of the oppressed" by
showing the sources, the extent and
the distribution of the many immi
grants which persecution had driven
to the shores of the new world. In
this study we have a succinct review
of the conditions that operated to
bring about the self-exile of these peo
ple, and we are enabled to understand
their peculiar dispositions in the face
of their new environments, and so are
better fitted to comprehend the parts
they played in the upbuilding of the
nation among whose pioneers they
were. The Walloons, the Puritans, the
Huguenots, the Quakers, the Mennon
ites, the Lutherans, the Jews, the
Waldenses, the Labadlsts, the Roman
Catholics, the Palatines, the Mora
vians, the Tunkers, all escaped from
the terrors of European persecution,
and found In the early colonies of the
Middle States and Maryland a refuge
from oppression and in general an un
fettered liberty to work out their own
success, while they enjoyed that lib
erty of conscience that had been de
nied them in their native lands. The
events 4nvolved In these migrations are
ably outlined In the present work.
A particular phase of this migration
Is treated under the head "Lord Balti
more's Experiment, 1632-16S5"; this
covers not merely the moving cause of
the establishment of the Maryland
colony, but also the outline story of
this privileged colony's progress for
over half a century. Both the pro
prietary and the colonists were placed
under liberal conditions In relation to
the mother country. The early troubles
of the new colonists with those of Vir
ginia and the Jealous opposition of the
latter are followed step by step. The
beginnings of legislative power; the
assertion of the colonists' right to self
government; the material development
of the colony; Its administrative regu
lations; its ecclesiastical matters, and
its boundary troubles with Virginia and
Pennsylvania are each and all amply
reviewed.

5others about the pomes and kindred subjects, she did not leave
me out of the conversation, as did the others, when they saw my
amiable purpose to instruct them on a point of political eco
nomics. I am aware, too, that it was to her I was indebted for
an invitation a young man gave me to become one of a coach
ing party to drive to a country club the next day for lunch.
I went on' the coach and was delighted to find myself placed
by the side of Mrs. Lacquerre.
My fair companion called attention to our host's driving, and
it surprised me to learn that niere' ability to handle reins â which
is possessed by every car driverâ was so highly esteemed by .her.
I saw that to be a real hero here one, besides possessing the rare
qualities I have, must also be able to do something, in the way of
sports, like driving a^ coach or a golf ball. While this surprised
me, I 1 am too much a man of the worlds not to recognize what
my place in society demands, so I determined to take up coach
ing at oncei Especially did I .resolve to do this when Mrs. Lac
querre remarked: "Coaching is a stunning sport, and I can
drive any four that ever looked through bridles, but it's so
deuced expensive a beggar like me has to pass it up."
Then I instantly resolved to present her a coach and four,
and when we arrived at the clubhouse I called, aside one of the
hired men who had been playing a horn on the coach, but with
out much musical results, and .told him if he knew of a proper
turnoutfor sale toilet me have particulars. He replied that it
was lucky I had spoken. to him, as he chanced to know of agreat
bargainâ if it had not been snapped up. He kindly offered to
telephone into town and icarn. It seems, as he explained, that a
gentleman who had .'lost heavily in Wall street was disposing, of
a coach andfour'at a'sacrificc.
' I ; :be'gged jhim to; hasten to the telephone at once, and, having
arranged so '"good a thing, T cheerfully accompanied our party "out
into the .field, where a number of people were engaged in playing
the fashionable game of golf. The game will never appeal to me.

1~"*\ EAR UNCLE SILAS: I am surprised at your letter,
I \ in which you take a humorous view of my experience
I 1 with a lottery ticket man, which you say is a common
' m. J confidence trick. For you to assume that I, with my
keenness of vision and quickness of wit, could be
taken in by the shallow pretense of a swindler is merely amusing
to me. Nay, the guileful men of New York will not profit by my
stay here. However, that is a difference of opinion between us it
would be fruitless further to discuss, so. I will proceed at once to
tell you of my call on your sister, my Aunt Sarah.
.:; v; I found her to be a lady of extreme elegance of manner and
abiding in a house of elaborate richness, excelling our own twen
story mansion in Beetville. She received me with great cordial
ity, but embarrassed me overmuch by dwelling oh the lirge for
tune I inherited.
I was puzzled, too, by aunt's statement that, the extent of
my fortune being known among her neighbors, or, as she said,
"in my set," she would have no difficulty in finding me a proper
wife. Poor, dear aunt ! t She really seemed to think that I would
marry a girl I could not win. by my own ungilded worth.
I accepted aunt's invitation to dinner and there first met, my
cousin Josephine, a young person of some pretensions to beau
ty, but, to my mind, too frivolous to be acceptable in intellectual
society. Still, all the young men at dinner except me were
voted to her, and were entertained by her pert comments on
worldly subjects in which the y^oung human female, in my judg
ment, should be but little informed. - .
Her frivolity of speech was in contrast with that of a lady
guest at dinner, a Mrs. "Jack" Lacquerre. She is -a widow, my
elder by some years, perhaps, but the most charming *of her sex
it has ever been my happiness to know. Unlike Cousin Joseph
ine, she did not always talk of golf, tennis, the -"ponies"â -which
trifling word is employed here to mean race horsesâ but was dis
posed to listen with agreeable interest to my, informing renfarks
~~on the future of beet sugar and the wickedness of those who
would let the stealthy products'of our insular possessionsâname
ly, cane sugarâ creep into pur unprotected homes free of duty, 1 to
the destruction of an infant but profitable industry.
Â¦ While she seemed to understand the childish chatter of the
P. S. â The world is false, hollow! Life is a nightmare one
would shun, except that it is cowardly to evade any duty â even
the sad duty of living. I shall go far away from this cruel city,
this heartless, cynical madness called New York, and sadly roam
distant lands striving to bury my. grief from sight. Forget it I
cannot. I called on Mrs. Lacquerre and for a time we spoke on
indifferent matters, I wanting to give her time to prepare for the
honor about to be conferred on her. We sat where we could look
into the street, and I was glad to see the coach approach, for it
would serve as an incident to base my declaration of love upon.
Her gaze was directed, at the turnout with great interest, but her
looks changed when she saw it stop at her door. She rose and
exclaimed in excitement, "What are those skates stopping here
for?" Supposing "skates" a term of endearment for the horses,
I saw my opportunity and, falling on my knees, I declared, "Dear
madam, they are yours. They are my gift to you, and with them
I also give you my heart and hand!"
With a look of horror in her eyes she cried : "Go out and tell
them to take those awful things away! The poor creatures are
doped nigh to death! And the coach! Only the varnish keeps
the rattletrap from falling apart. Oh, those dreadful skates; take
them away! Quick! a crowd is already gathering! Oh, oh!"
Stung to the soul of my pride, I. went to the door and ordered
the driver to return to the stables. A policeman, who had come
to see what the crowd was about, added : "And hufry about it or
the Bergh officers will come and order the poor, old 'doped*
skates shot."
I re-entered the house, again threw myself on my knees and
declared my love. The lady looked stunned for a moment, but
then said: "You are a very foolish and bold young man. I am
nearly old enough to be your mother and have a daughter old
enough to be your wife. Go away! You may come again when
you are quite sane, for you are worth saving, and with a little
trimming will make a presentable youngster."
''But," I exclaimed, "how abDiit my kiss of your hand yester
day under the tree, to which you did not object?"
"Under the tree?" she replied, after a thoughtful pause. "I
was fast asleep all' the time we were there."
With that she left the room hastily, and I came here to
write these last lines before I go out into the. strange world a
stranger and heartbroken. Â» R.
She said that if I felt that way about the game we had better
not follow, the players, but sit in the shade of a tree and wait for
our party to follow them until they had appetites for lunch. We
did so, while I conversed on various topics with her, among
them the value of fertilizers on land in which soil of an infusorial
character bore such proportion to the whole as to require artificial
enrichment to bring forth the most profitable results in sacchar
ose crystalline,' extractable from the beet. She was deeply im
pressed by my earnestness and erudition, and sat on the turf, re
clining against a tree, her parasol shading her eyos from my
view, and so silent, except for her light, regular breathing, I felt
that I had never before had so appreciative a listener.
At once to my confession : I fell deeply in love with Mrs.
Lacquerre at that moment. It was not her beauty, grace, social
position alone which enthralled me, but the discovery of a con
genial spirit, a soul which could throb as one with mine; and as
-she listened, rapt by the magic of my eloquence, motionless,
thrilled, f knew that here was a sympathetic nature worth all the
wealth of my love. To show what were my thoughts, and, as it
were, to learn her thoughts by an action, I raised one of her
hands to my lips. Rapture! there was no protest. I knew that
my feelings were reciprocated. The crowd neared, and, afraid to
remain by her side, lest my surging breast should force me to
speak though all the world heard, I hurried from her side.
. Behind the coach house the hired man reported to me that he
had telephoned to the agent of the turnout, who agreed to hold
it for me until nine o'clock that evening. The price, said the
man, was virtually a give-away, a mere two thousand five hun
dred dollars. It is difficult for me to accustom myself to what
New Yorkers call trifling sums, and, while of course. I could
easily afford the sum named, I said I thought it high. The man
replied that I had better snap at it, as he must telephone my de
cision at once. So I agreed to inspect the turnout that evening
and purchase if it suited me.
At lunch, on the drive home, I was in a trance of happiness.
At the Circle that evening I met the coach and four, driven
by the man who had conducted the trade for me. The horses'
coats shone like satin, their eyes gleamed, the coach glistened in
the electric lights like polished glass. I ascended to the side of the
driver who confided to me that I had been wise to close the deal by
telephone, for the agent had since had an offer of $4000 for the turn
out. I was anxious at hearing this, for I am well aware of the
trickiness of horse dealers, so I told the man to drive to the stables
at once and close the trade.
It was an exciting drive, for the animals seemed disposed to
go on their hind feet, or on their heads; but we reached the sta
ble in safety, the driver assuring me that the animals only need
ed a twenty-mile trot to settle down all right. The agent con
firmed the driver about having a larger offer, but I was sharp
with him and compelled him to accept the check I at once drew
in full payment. Then I ordered my purchase sent to Mrs. Lac
querre the next day and came to my hotel to write you of my
good luck.
Now, dear Uncle Silas, there is something else I will tell you;
it is my purpose to offer Mrs. Lacquerre something more pre
cious than a mere coach and four â my heart and hand! I shall
leave this letter open, that I may inform you how the dear lady ac
cepts the honor I shall confer upon her. Affectionately,
r sagely pointed out to Mrs. Laequerre that the feat could
be accomplished with less exertion and more certainty if the
player should take the sphere by hand from the sand hill and de
posit it by hand into the slight depression or recess, called the
hole, instead of endeavoring to do so by the aid of various imple
ments of wood and iron, swung with energy, but, frequently with
out results adequate to the force emploved. â¢
Its purpose is, so far as I could, discover, is to displace a small
sphere from one location and replace it in another, the first loca
tion being on a slight elevation of moist sand, the second being
a slight depression or recess in the turf. ;â¢"
REVBEN FROM BEETVILLE.
THE 1 SAN- FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL:do ho wrong. If i-*Â« c ;..-irhawk cared to listen to me for five
minutes I feel I cÂ«>Â»i-! \>n her right on this point. "It is quite
true, my dear girl," ! sh<u:ld say to her, "something is wrong, very
wrong. But it is not ihr American man. Never you mind the Amer
ican man ; you leave him to worry out his own salvation. You
are not the girl to put him right, even where he is wrong. And
it is not civilization. Civilization has a deal to answer for, I ad
mit; don't you load it up with this additional trouble. The
thing that is wrong in this case of yours â if you av:11 forgive my
saying so â is you. You make a fool of yourself; you marry a
man who is a mere animal because he appeals to your animal
instincts. Then, like the lady who cried out, 'Alack, I've married
a black,' you appeal to heaven against the injustice of being
mated with a clown. You are not a nice, clean girl, either in
your ideas or in your behavior. I don't blame you for it; you did
not make yourself. But when you set to work to attract all that is
lowest iii man, why beso astonished at your own success F.There are
plenty of shocking American men, I agree. One meets the class
even outside America. But nice American girls will tell you that
there are also nice American men. There is an old proverb about
birds of a feather. Next time you find yourself in the Company of
a shocking American man you just ask yourself how he got there
and how it is he. seems to be feeling at home. You learn self
control. Get it out of your head that you are the center of the uni
verse and grasp the idea that a petticoat is not a halo, and you
will find civilization not half as wrong as you thought it."
I know what Miss Sparhawk's reply would be. "You say all
this* to me â to me, a lady. Great heavens! What has become of
chivalry?" A Frenchman was once put on trial for murdering his
father and mother. . He confessed his guilt but begged for mercy
on the plea that he was an' orphan. Chivalry was founded on the
assumption that woman was worthy to be worshiped. The modern
woman's notion is that when she does wrong she ought to be ex
cused by chivalrous man because she is a lady. I like the naughty
heroine ; we all of us do. The early Victorian "heroine, the angel
in a white frock, was a bore. We knew exactly what she was go
ing to do---the right thing, j We did not ever have to ask ourselves,
"What will she think is the right thing to do under the circum
stances?"- It was always the conventional right thing. You could
have put it to a Sunday-school and have got the answer every time.
The .heroine with passions, instincts, emotions, is to be welcomed.
But I want her to grasp the. fact that after all* she is only one of
us. I should. like her better if, instead of demanding, "What is
wrong in civilization? What is the world coming to?" and so
forth, she would -occasionally say to herself, "Guess I've made a
fool. of myself this , time. ; I do feel that 'shamed of myself â "
She would not. lose by it. .We should love her all the more.
WHAT is wrong with marriage, anyhow? I find my
self pondering this question so often, when reading
high-class literature. I put it to myself again the
other evening, during a performance of "Faust." Why
could not Faust have married the girl? I would riot
have married her myself for any consideration ; but that is not
the argument. Faust, apparently, could not see anything amiss
with her. Both of them were mad about each other. Yet the idea
of a quiet, unostentatious marriage with a week's honeymoon, say
in Vienna, foljowed by a neat little cottage orne, not too far from
Nurnberg, so that their friends could have come out to them,
never seems to have occurred to either of them. There could have
been a garden and Marguerite might have kept chickens and a
cow. That sort of girl, brought up to hard work and by no means
too well educated, is all the better for having something to do.
â¢Later, with the gradual arrival of the family, a good all round
woman might have been hired to assist. Faust, of course, would
have had his study and got to work again ; that would have kept
him out of further mischief. The idea that a brainy man, his
age, was going to be happy with nothing to do all day but fool
around after a petticoat was ridiculous from the beginning. Val
entine â a good fellow, Valentine, with nice ideas â would have
spent his Saturdays to Mondays with them. Over a pipe and a
glass of wine he and Faust would have discussed the local politics.
He would have danced the children on his knee, have told them
tales about the war â taught the elder boy to shoot. Faust, with
a practical man like Valentine to help him, would probably have
invented a new gun. Valentine would have got it taken up.
Things might have come of it. Sybil, in course of time, would
have married and settled down-f^perhaps have taken a little house
near to them; watched Marguerite growing stout. He and Mar
guerite would have joked â when Mrs. Sybil was not around â
about his early infatuation. The old mother would have toddled
over from Nurnberg â not too often â just for the day. The pic
ture grows upon one the more one thinks cf it. Why did it
never occur to them? There would have been a bit of bother with
the Old Man. I can imagine Mephistopheles being upset about
it, thinking himself swindled. Of course if that was the reason â
if Faust said to himself, "I should like to marry the girl, but I
won't do it ; it would not be fair to the old man ; he has been to
a lot of trouble working this thing up; in common gratitude I
cannot turn round now and behave like a decent, sensible man. If
would not be playing the game."
If this was the way Faust looked at the matter there is noth
iv.g more to be said. Indeed it shows him in a rather fine light, no
ble, if not quixotic. If, on the other hand, he looked at the ques
tion from the point of view of himself and the girl, I think the
thing might have been managed. All .one had to do in those days
when one wanted to get rid of the devil was to show him a sword
hilt. Faust and Marguerite could be slipped into a 'church one
morning and have kept him out of the way with a sword hilt till
the ceremony was througn. They might have hired a small boy.
"You see the gentleman in red. Well, he wants us and we don't
want him. This is the only difference between us. Now, you
take this sword, and when you see him coming show him the hilt.
Don't hurt him ; just show him the sword and shake your head.
He will understand."
The old gentleman's expression, when subsequently ' Faust
presented him to Marguerite, would have been interesting. "Allow
me ! My wife. My dear a â a friend of mine. You may remember
meeting him that night at your aunt's." As I have said, there
would have been ructions ; but I do not myself see what could
have been done. There was nothing in the bond to the effect that
Faust should not marry, so far as we are told. The Old Man
had a sense of humor. My own opinion is that, after getting over
the first annoyance he himself would have seen the joke. I can
even picture him lpoking in now and again on Mr. and Mrs.
Faust. The children would be hurried off to bed. There would
be, for a while, an atmosphere of constraint. But the Old Man had
a way with him. He would have told one or two stories at which
Marguerite would have blushed, at which Faust would have grin
ned. I can see the old fellow occasionally joining the homely so
cial board. The children, awed at first, would have sat silent,
with staring eyes. But, as I have said, we gather that he had
a way with him. Why should he not have reformed? The good
woman's unconsciously exerted influence ! The sweet childish
prattle ! Might he not have come to be known as "Nunkic."
Myself â I believe I have already mentioned it â I would not
have married Marguerite. She is not my idea of a good girl. I
never liked the way she deceived her mother. And that aunt of
hers! Well, a nice girl would not have been friends with such a
woman. Slfi did not behave at all too well to Sybil, either. It is
clear to me that she led the boy on. And what was she doing
with that box of jewels, anyhow? She was not a fool. She could
[not have gone every day to that fountain, chatted with those girl
friends of hers and learnt nothing. She must have known that
people don't go leaving twenty thousand pounds' worth of jewels
about on doorsteps as part of a round game. Her own instinct,
if she had been a good girl, would have told her to leave things
alone. I don't believe in these innocent people who do not
know what they are doing half their time.
Ask any London magistrate what he thinks of the lady who
explains that she picked up the diamond brooch, "not meaning, of
course, your Worship, to take it. I .would not do such a thing.
It just happened this way, your Worship. I was standing, as
you might say, here, and not seeing any one about in the shop
I opened the case and took it out, thinking as perhaps it might
belong to some one â and then this gentleman here, as I had not
noticed before, comes up quite suddenly and says, 'You come along
with me,' he says. 'What for?' I says, 'when I don't even know
you/ I says. 'For stealing,' he says. Â«

what you mean, I'm sure/ " If the lady happens to be Goethe's

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALLV

"Marguerite the magistrate, I suppose, would apologize to her and
tell her that she left the court without a stain upon her character.
And if she had put them all on, not thinking. ' what would a
proper sort of a girl have done when the gentleman . came up and
assured her they were hers? She would have been thirty seconds
taking them off and flinging them back into the box. "Thank
you," she would have said, "I'll trouble you to. leave this garden as
quickly as you entered it and take them with you. \Vm not that
sort of a girl." What does Marguerifc. do? She clings to the
jewels and accepts the young man's arm for a niponlight prome
nade. And when it does.enter her innocent head that he and she
have walked that shady garden, long enough, what does she do
when she has said good-by and shut the door? She opens the
ground floor window and begins to sing.
Maybe I am not poetical, but I do like justice. When other
girls do these things they get called names. I do not see why
this particular girl should be held up as an ideal. She kills her
mother; according to her own account it appears to have been an
accident. It is not an original line of defense and we are not al
lowed to hear the evidence for the prosecution. She also kills lTcr
baby. You are not to biame her forthat, because at the time she
was feeling poorly. I don't see why this girl should have a spe
cial line of angels to take her up to heaven." There must have been
decent, hard-working women in Nurnberg more entitled to the
ticket. '
Why is it that all these years, we have been content to accept
Marguerite as a type of innocence and virtue. The explanation
is, I suppose, that Goethe wrote at a time when it was the conven
tion to regard all women as good. Anything in petticoats was vir
tuous. If she did wrong it was always somebody else's fault.
Cherchez la fernme was a later notion, i In the days of Goethe it
was always Cherchez rhommc. It was the man's fault. It was
the devil's fault. It was anybody's fault you liked, but not hers.
The convention has not yet died out.
I was reading the other day a most interesting book by a bril
liant American authoress. Seeing I live far away from the lady's
haunts, I venture to mention names. ? I am speaking of "Patience
Sparhawk," by Gertrude Atherton. I take this book because it is
typical of a large body of fiction. Miss Sparhawk lives a troubled
life; it puzzles her. She asks herself what is wrong. Her* own
idea is that it is civilization. If it is not civilization then it is the
American man or. nature â or democracy. Miss 'S^parhawk marries
the wrong man. Later on she gets engaged to the wrong man. In
the end we are left to believe she is about to be married* to the
right man. IÂ»should be better satisfied if I could hear, -Miss' Spar
hawk talking six months after that last marriage. But if a mis
take has again been made I am confident that, in Miss Spar
hawk's opinion, the fault will not be Miss* Sparhawk's. The ar
gument is always the same; Miss Sparhawk, being "'-.a- lady/ can

"How can I have a pretty black lace

"without paying for it?" The question
is a difficult one, but may be answered
by suggesting a substitute. There ara

and up the front. Tho lining of the
dress was of black satin.

make up this gown with rope shirrings
around the hips, put on in circular
shape. And she will trim It around the
foot with three round ruffles.

hoops is frequently heard, while, as for
bustles, they certainly He a foot deep

The bustle agitation Is one that will
never quite die down. As long as there

The modistes will tell you that there
are no hoop skirts worn. But If you
look at 6ome of the new gowns you
Â¦will be Inclined to doubt their word.
These gowns are built to set out In bal
loon fashion and they certainly invite
the use of a hoop skirt.
On the hoopskirt question one might
quote from the private letter of a Paris
dressmaker to a patron. Writing in
French, this .well-known authority
eays: "I Bend your gown, madame,
and the hoop skirt that goes with It. If
madame does not want to wear the
hoopskirt there is a stiff white taffeta
petticoat, all ruffles, and another one.
Both are ruffled and trimmed with
lace and will act in place of the hoop
skirt."
The wedding gown is the simplest of
the simple. The skirt is shirred on
the hips, a style which Is very effective
even if not new. Around the foot there
is a. ruffle" of net bordered with lace.
But the prettiest feature is the petti
coat worn underneath. This petticoat is
made of white lawn. And it Is trimmed

The flower gowns are so numerous

lishment has adopted the expedient of
naming each gown before it goes out

trimmings added receives its . flower

The ballroom effects will bfe .flower

them. Each dress will be built after
a flower and will be complete ,ln its

note. One gown, a jonquil gown, is in
pale yellow tatfeta trimmed with ruf
fles of dyed lace of precisely the same
tone. The belt is scarlet with an em T
broidery of yellow and there is a little
scarlet embroidery upon the waist.
Scarlet and yellow give a gown a very
flowerllke effect.

The Hair Dressed Low.
Handsome dresses are in the Eugenie
nfodels in those days when they wore
a bun. And, what i3 more, the women
of to-day are wearing the bu^. With
the coming In of the low style of hair
dressing the big, round chignon is actu
ally demanded .by women of slender
tresses, and it is not at all unusual to
see the great coil of hair low hanging
upoji the neck, either covered by a net
or not. This style is becoming to so
many that it will probably grow more
popular.
Of course, the postillion tabs will not
go out. But they come in many forms.
There are the two little tails, buttoned
to the back of the belt with handsome,
buttons. And there are the belts with
danglers In the back, long cotton
shaped ornaments and silk trimmings,
with fringe hanging from wheel-shaped
pieces.
But the majority of the belts are
girdle shaped, wide and on the crush
order, extending well up under the
arms. The neatness of this girdle fin
ish cannot be questioned, and it is no
wonder that it is growing in popular
estimation. Women, who formerly
thought one belt enough for the fall
season are now supplying themselves
with from six to sixteen.' And this is no
fairy tale.
One woman declares that her ward
robe is quite made by her numerous
girdles. Being short of figure, she
plans them so that they come down be
low the belt, making a becoming point
below the natural waist line. They are
always extremely wide and are made
in a great variety of ways from a very
great variety of materials. She uses
Klen-i hu'.r a d-.zen ut the tiniest

And there are fichus that knot upon
the breast and hang down far below
the waist line. But these low hanr;ln,r
fichus somehow have the suggestion of
a r.egiiste. and one cannot get rid of
the idea that they are more .appropri
ate upon the dinner gown than upon
the breakfast dress.
One of thesa handsome fichus is madu

lovely floral embroidery. Flowers
chase each other all over the fichu.
so that, when it is folded upon the
shoulders there Is a distinct floral vlr.2.
Finally the fichu is folded across th*
bosom in surplice fashion, and is se
cured at the belt.
To Wear on the Neck.
Fichu pins are much seen. They
are handsome little jeweled ornaments
for fastening the fichu to the sash or
to tho bodice. They are not stick pins,
but are substantial pins, very much set
with colored stones or made of plain
pearl, in whose depths many colors
shine.
The fancy for throwing something
or other around the neck Is a growing
one. Furs have already appeared,
and women who own handsorno sable*
collars are wearing them with their
evening gowns, even though It be- sum
mer time. The custom of wearing furs
all the year around has always been
the Â¦vogue abroad. But It has not al
ways been the style here. But now
the nice furs are brought out and
women who own a $100 0 collar are
not Inclined to put It away out of sight
half the year.
A rich New York woman owns what
she calls a Persian lamb necklace. It
is on the boa order, wide and Cat. and
she throws it around her neck and
shoulders over her dinner gown. It
gives the necessary note of black,
and, being soft and velvety. It seems
to be a part of the dinner costume, no
matter what Its color may be.
The wide, flat feather collars are
worn, and they are trimmed very often
with dangling things, and quite as
often with bands of silk, and even wltli
embroidery.
Not a few of the handsome dinner
dresses show a decided inclination to
fellow the fad for putting on a kind
of trimming on top of the other. There
are two kinds of lace, one appllqued
over the other. And there are hand
some, dressy materials, heavily em
broidered, and over the embroidery
there Is a trimming of raised flowers.

Young Croesus had had a general
idea that he would be the whole thing
and something over in his' menage
and that Amy's activity would be "con-
fined to holding down a pile of cush
ions In the cozy corner and wishing
that It was time for hubby dear to
come home from that dreadful 'bfflca
and have his head stroked. His sur
prise was considerable when he read

for his dally walk and 'conduct after
the honeymoon had seti'He.was never
to go to the club without a Â¦ special
dispensation that must be arranged
for at least two days in advance. and
under no circumstances was he to stay

shoved at him enumerating the num
ber of things that were absolutely nec
essary for the peace and : comfort of
the household. After that had been
attended to and a proper allowance
made for the things that ought to be
bought because they were so cheap,
he might use the rest of his income as
he saw , fit. It is unnecessary to re
mark that there never was any rest,
either for '. the income or for Croesus.
This has been going on for a num
ber of years and Croesus has grown
hardened to it, but he still wonders
how he made such a mistake in Bis

tory, conclusion at which he has ar

rage among the fair sex of the com
munity. EnouTgh caps had been set at
â¢ him to maintain three able bodied mil
linery shops and . he had to hire a
private detective to sit outside the
door when he was asleep to Jceep peo
ple from breaking in and carrying him
off.
v The gentle Amy had never been se
riously considered among the entries
for the matrimonial sweepstakes. It
- '.s generally thought that she was
too sweet and frail a thing to trust
herself into the cold and chilling at
mosphere of the "practical world where
such [business-like affairs as matri
monial alliances are consummated. * In
fact, it was generally supposed, at
least among the member- of her own
sex, that Amy Intended to devote her
life to the succoring of the poor and
helpless. It never occurred to them
that that's what most married women
do; if it wasn't for the necessity of
caring for the aforesaid poor and
helpless it is doubtful if there would
be very many marriages in this sin
ful world. Since Solomon, that stand
ard authority on matrimony, gave it
up, there is no one to speak with
grsat weight on the exact nature of
the qualities that women like in men,
but it is a safe bet that most women
enter into the more or less holy
bonds of wedlock Just to keep the men
from hanging around and bothering
other people.
Matrimony is like dreams, . it gene
rally goes by contraries. It is not
meant to imply that married people
are contrary, not all of them at least
Nor is it suggested that the married
state is a dream from which most
people awaken in the course of time.
The theory which we are trying to
drag out into the cold and unfeeling
light of day Is that in marriage, as
on the stock exchange, you never can
telL Very few men marry the women
that other people have, picked out for
them and no women do. The only
time that a man ever allows some one
else to draw is when the individual
who draws keeps the ticket for her
self, and even then he seldom realizes
that he didn't put his hand into tho
box and choose for himself.
But we must return to Amy before
the gentle creature gets frost-bitten.
Amy never let the unappreclative
world know that she was out for the
money herself and that she had a line
dangling for the youthful descendant
of J. Pierpont Croesus. She jus% sat
around where she was sure that he
could see her and looked pensive. She
realized that there would be time
enough to look expensive after it was
all over. Then when he happened
around in her neighborhood she
would draw a deep sigh from tha^
northeast corner of her gentle bosom
and cast her eyes upward as though
she was expecting a Marconlgram
from the other world every minute
telling her that she had overstayed
her leave. It was a great play and
it worked HKe a charm.
One evening young Croesus confided
to Amy that she made all the other
women look like ! millionaires' daugh
ters and that she was all to the good
and the returns still coming in. At
this she sent down a hurry-up call for
another sigh, extra deep, and informed
him in appealing tones and with what
Is known in the trade as a swift up
ward glance that she had trusted him
instinctively from the first minute that
he came around the corner. . After
that there was nothing to ,do but to
send out the cards'and get busy with/
the dressmaker. ;
After she had him safely in the fold
with a Yale lock on the gate, Amy
began to lay her catds on the table
face up and he discovered that what
he had imagined was an angel * very
thinly disguised was a full ; grown
woman with a slight suggestion of the
place from which angels are Â¦ not de
rived. During the period of courtship
up â¢ to and extending a short distance '
into the honeymoon Amy had seemed
to exist principally on air and poetry
administered In large doses. After the
â¢t ER name was Amy, and that
Lj was Just the way she looked.
j[ I The casual observer, who is al
+S ways around where he is not
wanted, would have sworn that she
was a dead ringer for the late gentle
Amy. who so sadly disappointed the
poet laureate in his early years. She
was Email and wistful and looked as
though she was always on the point
of bidding adieu to this vain world on
account of its vanity and crudity and
general lack of gentleness. The first
Impression that every male creature
had on first sighting Amy was that
she should be wrapped carefully in
cotton and woolÂ«and laid away so that
the wind's of Manitoba and the coun
try in the back of Fargo should not
visit her too roughly, and that he was
the man to do it. She had the robust
appetite of a canary bird, at least in
public, and ehe never seemed to be
able to walk more than two blocks
without resting. â
Beside the wistful Amy all the other
girls in sight looked like coarse, un
feeling, and rudely healthy creatures,
who thought only of the three square
meals a day that were coming to
them. Of course, , it happened, as it
always does, at least in novels, that
there was one young man in town
who was very much in demand among
the opposite sex. He had so much
money that he couldn't' be bothered
with thinking about it and It was even
rumored that he had been known to
indulge in speculations In shipbuilding
stock and other wild dissipations with
out a thought of the probable conse
quences. It was not that he was
naturally vicious; be was young and
rich, that was all, and it is universally
admitted that youth must have its
fling, especially when it has money in
the bank to pay for what has been
flung.
As has been remarked above, this
particular young man was quite the
First and foremost it must be re
membered that to commit the instruc-
tions to memory is not all that is nec
essary. A woman must practice them
Take the ruffian -who attempts to
steal your brooch or grasp you by the
throat. Up go your hands and you
take a grip oa his forearm near the
and keep in practice, for this is the
only keynote to~a successful applica
tion. It will be found after practice
that almost unconsciously wfien any
one's hands are placed on you sud
denly you - will at once assume a de
fensive attitude, which if it is a seri
ous case will give you an advantage,
which will make you mistress of the
situation. But without practice yo*4
will not be able to cope with your as
sailant.
Another thing to remember Is to
watch the eyes of your assailant. He
has got to look where he Is going to
grab and you will be able to forecast
his move.
Just as soon as you down your ruf
fian get away, using all your powers
of speech to summon heljv
There is another of the same- order
that will throw a ruffian. It la to
grab the back of the neck with the
left hand and shova the right In his
face so that the fingers coma under his
nose. An upward pressure against the
nose will throw Miim off his balance
In a second and he will go down. , There-
Is no stopping; the strongest man in
the world cannot stand the pain. It
makes him as helpless as a child.
An act which requires a great deal
of practice, but is very effective when
accomplished, is to grab the wrist when
one is being struck and Jerk it In the
direction of the blow. This. In many
eases, will pull the arm out of the
socket at the shoulder, but to accom
plish It one must be exceedingly quick
with arms and feet, for it means that
you must sidestep out of range as you
grab the wrist.
Another thing that n don* un
der the same circumstance is* to side
step and grasp the wrist with both
hands and quickly torn the arm out
ward. This will also throw him off his
balance and more than likely will bring
him lo the ground.
Always remember one thing: Bare;
step backward, for you loss your bal
ance and put yourself at a disadvan
tage. Practice stepping sideways out
of danger. By practice you will find
which hand Is going to be used and
you can take the other side.
Another good source of protection la
to carry a good stout stick pin In your
collar. This is easier to find and will
allow of quicker action.
There is one way to place a ruffian,
especially one who is under the Influ
ence of liquor, at your mercy, and that
Is the well-knov.n trick of pulling thÂ«

*A trick which is likely to give one a
shudder when it is considered, but yet
one which is permissible when one feel*
that it is to be used in self-defense.
Is to grasp the face, gouging the thumb
deep into the eye. There la no human
being that can F*r.:.d the pain and It
will result In throwing the ruffian flat
on his back. It will take all the fight
out of a man. It is a garr.e not to his

a fulcrum and with a sudden Jerk
downward you will break hia arm. In
practice do this slowly, for it Is most
powerful and if you ara not careful
you will make your subject a candi

In traveling alone on the streets at
night it is a splendid idea to carry *
parasol or umbrella. Keep It un
latched with the right hand on thÂ«
slide at the rib3. If you are attacked
and the ruffian tries to grasp you It
is very easy to open it In his face. You
will find that the sudden opening of It
will cause him to try and crab you.

into his face with the right hand ex
tended you will be able to duck past
him to one side and out of danger
while he Is trying to get the parasol
or umbrella, out of his way.
Another defense in the use of thÂ» hit
pin when attacked from behind.
The mere act of raising the arm wlU
cause the ruffian to press downward

stop you from getting your hat pin.
when you can twist around and his
face will be at your mercy.
This is in striking opposition to New
York, the greatest city in the United
States, where a woman cannot walk
two blocks, after dark, without having
some one speak to her. There may be
occasions even here when a woman
may meet a ruffian who is intent on
robbery or under the influence of
liquor. It is at such times that her
presence of mind must outwit his
strength. It is for that purpose that
these few simple instructions are given.
At t!i<? present time San Francisco
Â«>::joyE a reputation which it is safe
to say ko other city can boast of. It
is that its women are safe to travel
its streets at all hours unmolested. If
they vvi'.l go strictly about their busi
ness. It docs happ<jn sometimes that a
women is accosted ar.d if she is in
Â¦
hÂ« arlng distance of any one, no matter
how bad the neighborhood, a cry for
help will be answered.
4~WIME and time again when some
I account appears In the papers de-
I scribing a ruffianly attack upon
JL a woman on the streets you have
heard the women folks of your house
hold exclaim: "I know I should faint
if that happened to me." Now. in nine
cases out of ten they don't faint, but
put up a struggle, with overwhelming
odds of strength against them, that is
really to be admired.
The average woman in a desperate
situation is more to be depended upon
then the average man. Taking: this
fact for granted, the average woman,
with the knowledge of a few defensive
tricks, can easily handle the ruffian

grateful surprise and admiration.
But, revenons a nos moutonsâ the so
cial popularity of the American wo
man In English society. That this is
popular is an admitted and contest
able fact. She competes with the na
tive British, female product at every
turnâ in her dress, in her ways. In her
irresistible vivacity, and above all in
her intelligence. 'When she knows
things, she lets people know. that she
knows things. She cannot sit with her
hands before her in stodgy silence, let
ting other folks talk. That Is an Eng
lish habit. No doubt the English girl
or woman knows quite as much as her
gives a joyous lightness to the bound
ing of her heart and the swift grace
of her step. She is full erf energy aa
well as charm. If she sets out to enjoy
herself, she enjoys herself thoroughy.
She talks and laughs freely. . She is
not a mere well-dressed automaton
like the great majority of upper-class
British dames. She Is under the im
pression (a perfectly correct one) that
tongues were given to converse with,
and that lips, especially pretty ones,
were made to smile with. She is, taken
Â¦
at her best, eminently good-natured
and refreshingly free from the jaun
diced spite against others of her own
sex which savors the afternoon chit
ter-chatter of nine out of every ten
English spinsters and matrons taken
together in conclave. She would, on
the whole, rather say a kind thing than
a cruel one. Perhaps this is because
she is herself so triumphant in her so
cial careerâ because she is too certain
of her own power to feel "the pangs of
unrequited love," or to allow herself
to be stung by the "green-eyed mon
ster," jealousy. Her care is always
rolling over rosesâ there is always a
British title going a-beggingâ always
eome decayed or degenerate or eeml
drunken peer, whose fortunes are on
the verge of black ruin, ready and
willing to devour, monster like, the ho
locaust of an American virgin, pro
vided bags of bullion tare flung, with
her. Into his capacious maw. Though
certainly, one should look upon the
frequent marriages of American heir
esses with effete British nobles, as the
carrying out of a wise and timely dis
pensation of Providence. New blood
fresh sapâ is sorely needed to invigor
ate the grand old tree of the British
aristocracy, which has of late been
looking sadly as though dry rot were
setting In, as though the woodllce were
at work in its heart and the rats bur
rowing holes at its root But, thanks
to the Importation of a few clean
minded, sweet-souled American wo
men, some of the most decayed places
in the venerable stem have been
purged and purifiedâ the sap has risen
and new boughs and buds of promise
are sprouting. And It is -lull time that
this should be.
For. we have had to look with shame
sertive personality acknowl
edged everywhere? Why is she received
by Knights and Earls and belted churls
Â¦with such overpowering enthusiasm?
Sure!y something subtle, elusive and
mysterious clings to her particular
form, nature and identity, for more
often than not the stolid Britisher,
while falling at her feet and metaphor
ically kissing the hem of her garments,
wonders vaguely how it is that she
manages to make such a fool of them!
To which she might reply, on demand,
that if he were not a fool already she
would not find her task so easy. For
the American woman is, above all
the women in the world, cleverâ or let
us say "brainy" to an almost Incredible
height of bralniness. She is "all there."
She can take the measure of a man in
about ten minutes and classify him as
though he were a botanical specimen.
She realizes all his limitations, his
"notions" and his special and particu
lar fads, and the has the uncommonly
good sense not to expect much of him.
She would not "take any" on the lily
maid of Astolat, the fair Elaine, who
spent her time in polishing the shield
of Lancelot and who finally died of love
for that most immoral but fascinating
knight of the round table. No, she
wouldn't polish a shield, you bet! She
would make Lancelot polish it himself
for all he was worth, and polish her
own dear little boots and shoes for her
into the bargain. That is one of her
secretsâ masterfulnessâ or, let uÂ« say
queenllness, which sounds better. The
lord of creation can do nothing in the
way of ordering her about, because as
the lady of creation ehe expects to or
der him aboutâ and she does. Ehe ex
pects to be worked for, worshiped and
generally attended to, and she gets her
way. What she wants, she will have,
though "companies" smash and mighty
combines split into infinite nothing
ness; and, more than anytamer of wild
forest animals, she makes all her male
lions and bears dance at her bidding.
Perhaps the â¢chief note In the ever
ascending scale of her innumerable at
tractions is her intense vitality. The
mixed blood of many intelligent races
courses through her delicate veins and

Exchange.)
"Old maid" may apply to the unfor
tunate female who has passed all the
days of her youth In talking about men
and in failing to catch so much
as one of the wandering tribe, and who.
on arriving at forty years, meekly re
tires to the chimney corner with a
shawl over her shoulders and Eome use
ful knitting, but it carries neither
meaning nor application to the brisk,
brilliant American spinster who at fifty
keeps her trim svelte figure, dresses
well, goes here, there and everywhere,
and sheds her beaming smile with
good-natured tolerance, and perchance
something of gratitude as well, on the
men she has escaped. Life does not
run only In one channel for the Ameri
can Woman. She does not "make
tracks" solely from the cradle to the
altar, from the altar to the grave. She
realizes that there is more fun to be
got out of being born than just this
little o!d measure meted out to her by
the barbaric males of earliest barbaric
periods, when women were yoked to
the plow with cattle â as they still are
in some parts of Switzerland. And It
is the Innate consciousness of her own
power and Intelligent ability that gives
her the dominating charm â the mag
netic spell under which the stolid Brit
isher falls more or less stricken, stupe
fied and inert. He is never a great
talker; she is. Her flow of conversa
tion bewilders him. She knows so
much, too â she clatters of Shakespeare,
Byron, Shelley. Keatsâ and he thinks
he has heard of these people some
where before. He listens dumbly.
Sometimes he scratches his headâoc
casionally he feels his- moustache, if â¢
he has one. "When she laughs, he
smiles slowly and dubiously. He hopes
she Is not laughing at him. He feels
âhe feelsâ dontcherknowâ that she Is
"ripping." He couldn't tell you what
he means by "ripping" to save his life.
But painfully' accustomed as he Is to
the dull and listless conversation of the
British materfamillas, and to the half
hoyder.ish conduct of the British tom
boy girl who will Insist on playing golf
and hockey with him in order not to
lose him out of her sight, he Is alto
gether refreshed and relieved when
the American Woman dawns upon his
cloudy horizon, and Instead of waiting
upon him, commands him to wa.it upon
her with one dazzling look of her
bright, audacious eye.
The American woman Is not such a
fool as to go play hookey with him at
all times and In all weathers, thereby
allowing him to take the unchecked
measure of her ankles. Sh* is too
clever to do anything that might pos
sibly show her In an unlovely or un
graceful light. She takes care to keep
her hands soft and small and white,
that they may be duly caressable â
and makes the best and prettiest of
herself on all and every occasion. And
that she' has succeeded in taking Eng
lish society by storm is no matter for
surprise. English society, unmixed
with any foreign element, is frequently
said to be the dullest in the world.
It Is an entertainment where no one la
entertained.' A civil apathy wraps
each man and woman in Its fibrous
husk, and sets them separately apart
behind barricades of the most idiotic"
conventionaUty. The American Woman
Is the only being that can break down
these barricades and tear the husk to
shreds. No wonder she Is popular!
The secret of her own success is in
her own personal charm and vivacious
Intelligenceâ In her light scorn of
stupid ceremonies â In the frank genial
ity of her disposition (when she can
manage to keep it unspoiled by con
tact with the reserved hypocrisy of the
"smart set,") and the delightful spon
tanlety of her thoughts which find
such ready expression In equally spon
taneous speech. Altogether the Amer
ican Woman Is a valuable Importation
Into Great Britain. She Is an Incar
nation of the present and an embyro of
the future. She Is a gifted daughter
of the British race, holding within her
bright, vital ambitious identity many
of the greater responsibilities of Bri
tain. And to the question "Why Is she
popular?"' the answer is sjmple^'be
cause she deserves to be!"

heads of the day to whom no oppor

and colleges â women who, being left

tnat much of the popularity attending
an American girl when flhe first conies
over to London for a '"season" Is due
to an idea which the stolid Britisher
gets into his head, namely, that she
has, she must have, money. The
American girl and money are twins,
according to the stolid Britisher's be
lief. And when the stolid Britisher
fixes something, anything, into the
passively resisting matter composing
his brain It would take leviathan with
not one, but several hooks, to unflx it.
And thus it often happens that the
sight of a charmingly dressed, grace
ful, generally "smart". American girl
attracts the stolid Britisher in, the
first place because he say3 to himself,
"money!" He knows all the Incomes
of all the best families In his own
country, and none of them are bis
enough, to suit him. But the Ameri
can girl arrives as more or less of a
financial mystery. She may have thou
sands, she may have millions; he can
never be quite sure. And he does all
he can to Ingratiate himself with her
and give her a good time 'on spec" to
begin with, while he makes cautious
and diplomatic inquiries. If his hopes
rest on a firm basis his attentions are
redoubled; if, on the contrary, they
are built on shifting sand he gradually
diminishes his ardor and like a "wilt
ing flower" fades and "fizzles" away.
I am here reminded of a certain
Carl, renowned in the political and so
cial world, who, when a young man,
went' over on a visit to America and
there fell or feigned to fall deeply in
love with a very sweet, very beautiful,
very gentle and lovable American girl.
In a brief while he became engaged
to her. The engagement was made
public â the wedding day was almost
fixed. The girl's father was extremely
wealthy and she was hia only, child
and sole heiress. But an unfortunate
failure â a gigantic collapse in the
money market, made havoc of the
father's fortunes' 5 and as soon as his
ruin was declared beyond a doubt the
noble Earl, without much hesitation
or ado, broke off hi3 engagement and
rapidly decamped from the States
back to his own country, where, as all
the world knows, he did very well for
himself. Strange to say, however, the
girl whom he had thus brutally for
eaken for no fault of her own had
loved him with all the romantic and
trusting tenderness of first love . and
the heartless blow inflicted upon her
by hl3 noble and honorable lordship
was one from which she never re
covered. The- noble \and honorable
has, I repeat, done very well for him
self, though it Is rumored that he
Bleeps badly and that he has occasion
ally been heard muttering after the'
fashion of Hamlet, Prince of Den
mark, "Oh, God, I could be bounded
In a nutshell and count myself a king
of infinite space were it not that 1
have bad dreams!"
Marriage, however, is by no" means
the only, or even the chief resource
in life of the American woman. She
evidently looks with a certain fav^or
on the holy estate of matrimony and is
quite willing to become an excellent
wife and mother if the lines of her
destiny run that way, but If they
should branch out in another direc
tion, she wastes no time in useless pin-
Ing. She is too vital, too capable, too
intelligent and energetic altogether to
play the role of an Interesting martyr
to male neglect. She will teach, or she
will lecture â she will sing, or she will
act â she will take her degrees In med
icine and surgery â she will practice
for the bar â she will write books, and
the days are fast approaching when
she will become a high priestess of
the church, and will preach to the lost
sheep of Israel as well as to the
equally lost ones of New York or Chi

a "physical culture" woman, "a me

TO INCREASE FLESH (Mrs. M. P.)â
The vory thin woman must follow an
entirely different regimen from that<
ordinarily pursued if she expects to put
flesh on her bones. If she is inclined
to worry she should try and not be so
intense In unimportant matters; she
should shut her eyes, in a sense, to
everything she can. The troubles which
never happen wear out the nerves and
destroy the health more completely
than Important events. Read only
pleasant books, and talk .is much as
possible to cheerful, Jolly people, who
are too 'light-hearted to relate harrow

Hurry Is a twin brother to worry, so
try to take life aa leisurely as you
may. Diet Is of paramount impor
tance in growing flesh, and while over
feeding must not be confused with a
liberal diet, the thin woman must eat
plenty of only such foods as will yield
substantial , results. Sweet milk and
cream, eggs, "starchy and sweet veg

ACCEPTING GIFTS PROM AD
MIRERS (Ignorance). â Generally
speaking all gifts should be promptly
acknowledged orally or by a courteous
note of thanks. The Inexperienced
young woman must, however, learn
the vast difference between courteous
acknowledgment and being too grate
ful for favors received, particularly so
when there is an admirer in the case.*
Nothing so cheapens a woman in the
eyes of a man, no matter what his
sentiments toward her, as to have her
seem to take every trifling attention
as a direct compliment and be over
profuse in thanking him for such at
tentions. This being the case, I would
suggest that you do not acknowledge
feuch a trifle as a souvenir card unless
you see the gentleman or have oc
casion to write him' upon some other
subject; then. simply say you received
the card and thank him for it. He
should be the one to feel flattered that
you accept his gifts and attention, al
though It would not be wise to tell him
bo or to imply any such state of mind
by action on your. part. ; To
strike the happy medium when a grift
is received write a brief note, simply
thanking him. For example, if the
gift happens to be a book, say. that
you anticipate many pleasant hours
reading It or that the author is a fa-
paid for his or her brains, and not to
do "social stunts." This may seem to
you intensely practical, almost to the
point of being brutal, yet it Is strictly
true. Do not, however, misunderstand
me. I take it for granted that every
one will show his or her associates the
ordinary courtesies, but to expect your
employer or any male member of the
office staff to open doors when you have
occasion to leave the room, to arrange
the ventilation to suit you and other
like things is expecting too much. The
men with whom you are associated are
interested in their work, consequently
cannot be expected to neglect it to wait
upon you. If you are a wise girl you
will change vour tactics, and instead of
imagining every one intends a slight
go about the work assigned you in a
quiet, businesslike manner, and you
will soon V/e so absorbed in your work
that you wilj not notice the trifles of
which yoy complain. The woman who
is faithful, self-reliant, reserved and
dignified in her manners will meet with
consideration in the average office, but
there is no place in the business world
for the social martyr. To resign one
good position nfter another for no bet
tor reason than that you insist upon
being waited upon and accorded elab
orate courtesy will soon give you an
undesirable reputatlon'among business
men, and you will soon find it difficult
to obtain a position, for business men
will not stand such nonsense.
lunch before retiring. A glass or two
of warm milk and a slice of thickly
buttered brown bread will be sufficient.
Coffee .and sweets should never form
a part of such a repast.
DEPILATORY (A. C.) â Once a
month should be plenty to use any
good depilatory. I really doubt If it
will be necessary to use it bo often, but
much depends upon Individual cases,
of course. Try it and wait just as long
as you can before using it again. If
the hair comes out a dark color â you
see. I do not know whether you are

peroxide of hydrogen. Put about a tea
spoonful of ammonia in it and use it

THE FINICAL. .GIRL (Maude).â
Judging from your letter your troubles
in office work are largely of your own
making, because of a perverted idea of
business customs. The girl who starts
out. in life with the firm idea that she
will receive, if not exact, drawing-room
manners from all men she meets in an
office will surely meet sore disappoint
ment and strew her path with thorns
instead of roses. It is absurd for you
to say that a man who does not extend
you society courtesies in an office is not
a gentleman. You forget that in society
men and women have naught to do but
be at their best, while in the hurry of
a busy office each man and woman is

skirts I should by all means advise one.
If the amount of fabric makes any dif
ference take the simpler way. Make a
straight full skirt, gathered on to the
band at the waist, and for trimming
have three broad tucks. The other way
is a pleated skirt, full and straight.
With such a skirt I should advise a
shirt waist to match. Full and but

the man to himself and winked at the
sentinel through the darkness.
"At once, if you please." :
His wife had gone East, and he was
oot the man to enter into a flirtation
in her absence. Once more he saw
Peplta at the ranch as he rode on
official ''business, and once she was
found lingering around the fort as If
to get speech with some one. Gossip
filled in all the rest. It was a lonely,
out-of-the-world post, and there had
to be gossip about some one or some
thing. The major was .guyed by his
brother officere about the girl, and he
knew that the rank and file were talk-
Ing, but he went his way a^nd said
nothing. They would not know that
he had offered to send the girl East
where his wife or his mother might
provide for her.
Then one autumn night, when the
gossip was at its height, the sentinel
at the gate suddenly called for the
corporal of the guard. It was dark
and gusty, v/ith falls of rain at inter
vals, but he had caught sight of a
figure skulking about. The corporal
made a dash through the darkness and
laid his hands on a human beingâ on
a woman! It was Pepita! Near at
hand was the pony on which she had
covered a distance of twenty-eight
miles in the last four hours.
"I want to see the Senor Davis."
she said as the corporal demanded her
business.
ranch house and sought to put Jose at
his ease, his one object to get another
sight of the girl whose warning had
prevented a tragedy. For just five
seconds she stood in the half-open door
and smiled at him. but before he could
thank her she was gone.
This was the beginning of the major's
"mash;" as his regiment choose to
It.
"They are asitep, the pigs!" he whis
pered, "and it will need only one shot
apiece to do for them. Come!"
Five minutes later seven border out
laws crept down to within ten feet of
tho sleeping men. The sentinel stood
as one in a daze. The outlaws crept
another foot and the man on guard
suddenly wheeled, firing his musket
with deadly effect. His recumbent
comrades sprang to their feet and
poured in a volley which dropped three
ruffians.. The rest fled into the dark
ness with the fleetness of shadows, and
it was hardly a minute later when- the
coatless. hatless and vestless Jose
burst out of. the front door of the
ranch with the exclamation:
"Who Is it? What is.it? I am here
to die with theesenor and his brave
men!" ......
"We won't ask you, Jose, to do any
dying for us to-night," grimly replied
the major es he came forward. "In the
morning, after, we are gone, you may
dig graves for those dead comrades of
yours, if you want to oblige us."
. "My comrades, senor? God forbid! I
never saw one of them before. I permit
no bad ition to hang about my place.
The curred dogs, to come sneaking
upon you In the darkness to do mur
der!"
.' The Mexican tried to throw the ring
of truth into his words, but as he had
a bullet hole in his rhirt and could still
feel, the skin 1 smart where the lead had
grazed; it, he did not make much of a
success. Even when he went over, and
kicked one of the dead men nobody
asked to shake hands with him.
The major- ate. his breakfast in the
vrfde open and. his carbine rested by his
side.
At midnight to the minute Jose
lighted the candle and passed It back
and forth across the window a dozen
times, then,- taking his revolver from
a shelf, he softly quit the* house, and
after a walk of three hundred feet, he
stood before six men crouched behind
a. giant cactus.
She was gone before the son of Mars
could reach out and grasp her sleeve or
utter. a word in reply. He had stopped
at the ranch several times before and
knew that the girl was a recent ar
rival. Jose was back with the wine a
minute after ' the girl had disappeared,
but the officer waved him away saying:
"It is kind of you, Jose, but not to
night. .Â« In the morning, perhaps, you
may ask^ me to take a bottle along to
Fort Reno and have the colonel sam
ple; it with me." '
At 10 o'clock the major made excuse
that he would rather sleep in his ambu
lance, which was provided with, a cot,
and; at 11 all was quiet within and
without the, ranch. Within, however,
the Mexican stood at one of the rear
windows peering out into the darkness

She walked back to the little table,
carrying her parasol behind her in one
hand. Wilson was looking, curiously
at his highly polished nails. He had
never visited a manicuring shop be

plunged .his hand In his pocket and
drew out the emblem of. Western pros

table. "But I cannot repay you for all

he said, his eye3 twinkling.

Gerald .Wilson sat down very 'Â¦ sud
denly and his hand struck the coin. He
started back as if stung.
Then he pulled himself up with a
shako and hurled questions at her.
Where would . the Van Twillers prob
ably take him that day? What must
he wear at the Casino? When did
folks at Newport have time to sleep?
And she told him everything, from
the style of canvas shoes he had to
buy at once to Ihe number of course?
and the wines he would have at the
Lanson dinner, where he would prob
ably go with the Van Twillers that
night, but at last his hands were fin
ished. Even Â¦ the charmed Wilson
could not claim that the girl was a
rapid worker.
But no one did come in, and the girl
worked on while the man told her of
his struggles to hoi'd a property which
threatened not to pan out; of the hours
of discouragement,, relieved only by the
companionship .of books, and of the
final success, and of his modest hopes
for the future. "You know I do not care
for a whole heap of money," he said.
"I'd like to travel a bit in Europe,
to always have the books I wanted to
read, the pictures I like best about me,
and enough money to keep the one
woman in the world cumfy and happy."
"Have you found the right woman

"No." Then he looked thoughtfully
at her bowed head, crowned with soft
brown hair. "I have never felt I had
the right to look for her until now.
I was never very strong on the love
in-the-cottage idea."
"Do you think you will find her' here
at Newport?"
"Maybe. But â "
"Very well," said madame in a voice
which was not entirely steady. ?'as you

alcove, murmuring to herself: "B :t if
any one should come in Just now, la,
la, what a scandal it would be!"
"Well. I haven't seen her yet. I came
up on the late boat last night with Mr.
Van Twiiler, and between you and me,
when we got up to that palace of his,
and I saw people in the parlor and on
the porch in evening party togs I got

A shadow fell on the floor; a stout,
smartly clad woman paused in the
doorway. She almost gasped at sight
of the couple at the table. "Oh, Miss â "
The girl threw her a warning: glance,
but she could not stem - the tide of
apology.
"I would not have this happen for
the world!" The newcomer was visi
bly distressed. The girl looked up at
her with calm, smiling eyes.
"Oh. I'm doing very well, roadame!"
"Yes "'she hasn't cut me once," said
Wilson. "I do not believe you could
have done it better yourself."

the girl raised her. finger to her ;.p in

with frank, almost boyish admiration.
"But I am â erâ only a beginner."
said the girl in blue, trying hard not
to smile, "and I might hurt you."
The man threw back' his head and
laughed until the little French cur

In a few minutes 6he returned,
carrying Â» glass bowl filled with tepid
water, and laid forth the implements
cf the manicurist. Her eyes were
dancing. Gerard Wilson watched her
every move with interest. He had al
ready discovered that her dress and her
eyes were exactly the same color.
"1 thought I'd come around early,"
he explained, "before the place gets
crowded."
She nodded her head. "I always do,
too." she said, then caught herself
suddenly. "I mean we like customers
tu come early because It doesn't pay to
keep many girls down here, and yet
when people do come in they all want

rosy-tipped fingers. (

Paula's greatest charm for him was
an indescribable quality, a combination
of purity and comradeship that robbed
the most daring speech or aci of all un

thought uneasily on his way home; "It's

The next evening as Cutter sat chat

a small package were brought to him,
The note was but a line: "Now is the
accepting time. . Are you coming?" It
was signed with Paula Pendleton's
name. He read it hastily and sprang
to his feet in angry dismay. Then he
handed the note to his mother and ex

"Are you going?" she asked hardly

"No," he replied sternly. "I will not

doubtless amusing herself, as usual,
and if there is a favored one among

He turned sharply away, with chok

"You do care. Kenneth," persisted
his mother, wistfully.
"Yes," he answered shortly, "I care.
I care so much that I cannot tolerate

THE PROPOSALS PAULA
THE ~SAN~ FRANCISCO 'SUNDAY CAU1
14Ishmael brought the punt in f from
the grounds early next day. Ezra was
sitting in the sunshine by the cottage
door.
"Ishmael," said Ezra, "has you â has
you had the dream?"
Hope grew strong in his face. Then
his lips quivered and he turned his
eyes away, fearing new disappoint
ment.
"Ay," said Ishmael, "the dream has
come.",;- : -v*'o;;A l p x / â¢.'^ Â¦â¢. :

So Ishmael was given a place in the
home of Ezra Westerly. Night after
night he waited for the Lord to make
known the cure in a dream. By day ho
fished for Ezra from Ezra's punt â go
ing regularly at dawn to the grounds
off Mad Bull, and returning with his
catch in the evening; taking Ezra's
turn in the bait-skiff when. the caplin
schools came in; splitting cod far into
the night, if the fish were running
thick; spreading the eaten* to drv on
the flake when the Mad Bull shallows
were deserted. At odd times hs poured
over the old book, lest the Lord should
think him lukewarm in his search for
the cure. One night he read that sec
tion relatin? to "medicines made out
of living things"â read and puzzled till
his head was aching and muddled. "I
am of opinion," said the book, "that
the Suet of a Goat mixed with a little
Saffron is excellent an oyntment,
especially for pains," as any is." Then.
"The Froath of the Sea, it is hot and
dry; Being mixed with powdered
crabs' shells.- it helps chills. It helps
baldnef,?, and trimly decks the head
with hair." Again, "The Bone that
is found In the Heart of a Stag 13 as
fovereign a Cordial and as great a
f trengthener of the Heart as any is,
being beaten Into Powder." Thus on
and onâ pouring over the list of
strange cures.
"The heart of a stag," he thought,
putting, his hand, to his brow. "Now
they's a deal In that, I'm thinkin'."
He fell asleep over the table at last
with his head on the old book. ,

ness of Ezra's face and heard the rat
tle in his throat. u
"You is sick, man." he said. "You
is desperate sick."
"I'm tuk with the decline, zur," said
Ezra.
The need of healing, the spirit of
pain, made Ishmael's great heart ache.
He wondered if the Lord would grant
him a cure for this man. . .
"You has a wife, I'm thinkin'?" he
said.
"And a wee babe," Ezra answered,
smiling. â¢
"An' the Lard will oanly let me,'.'
said Ishmael, looking far off, "I'll cure
"Is there any place where a man
can be taken in for a bit?" Ishmael
called.
"Ay," said Ezra, lifting himself on
his arm. "They's always a place t 1
Ragged Ha'bor where an honest man
can bide." .
Ishmael brought his punt alongside
and caught hold of the other's gun-
Meanwhile the healer from Far-Away
Cove had come down the coast, pass
ing from harbor to harbor in a rotten,
ragged old punt, everywhere applying
those cures which, as he believed, tha
Lord disclosed to him in dreams.
"I am a healer by command o' the
Lard," he told the people. "He is my
helper."
"Is you, now?" said they. "By com
mand o' the Lard! My, but 'tis a
wonderful thing!"
In .the evening of the day when the
seventh son of a seventh son had died,
Jimmie Lute made Ragged Harbor
from Fortune, with Ezra Westerly
lying exhausted In the bow of the
punt. The west was flaring red â the
wind had j fallen away â all the earth
was quiet â the punt slipped over long,
soft billows. Ishmael Roth sounded
the Pillar Just as Jimmie passed the
Staff; the punts crept side . by side
down the narrows to the still water
of the harbor, where it lay at the feet
of the grim hills, all crimsoned by the
sun.
"Iss," said Thomas, with a sigh.
" 'Twould 'a' been grand t' have the
seventh son. of a seventh son t' flsh
from the same punt with me. 'Tis a
pity."
They watched the mist break and
lift â the sunlight spread over the sea.
"Leave us goa hoame, b'y," said
Jimmie.
"Ies," Ezra whispered, for his Voice
had grown of a sudden very weak.
"I'm thinkin'," he went on, with a fine
smile, "that the Lord wants we in
heaven. Leave us 20a hoame."
They went down the path very
slowly.

Ezra gasped. " 'Tis a pity!" he cried,
hi3 voice strong and athrill with sym
pathy. " 'Tis a pity, man, f lose your
wee child like that. I'm fair sorry for
you."
"The child's dead," said Thomas.
Ezra darted an anxious glance into
his eyes. "Is they noa cures worked
yet?" he whispered.
Thomas scratched his head.
"Nar a one?" said Ezra.
"Just a touch, b'y. Sure I wouldn't
think o 1 hurtin' the wee thing."
"I doan't know as 'twill do you any

frown.
staring the while at Ezra in a vacant
way.
his face contorted by agony, "tlAt I'va
mistook my callin*. 'Tis like tha Lard
never meant me t' be a healer."
"Sure He did!" said Mary. They**
nar a doubt about that."
They were silentâ all cast down la
bitterness and despair, while tha rain
rattled on the window panes and a
burst of wind beat furiously upoa tha
house. tg*- \ *
"Ishmael," said Ezra at last, "you
done your best."
"Ay," said the healer, "I doaÂ« my
best." *'i_-
"An' I done ray best," Bald Ezra.
"Ay, an' you done your best."
"The Lard He done His bestâ surely
the Lard done His best," said Ezra,
gently.
"Ay; surely the Lard He dona His
best," said Ishmael. "Blessed ba ths
Lard."
"There's noa call t' grieve, Ishmael,"
said Mary. "They's noa call at all."
"I'm thinkin'," said Ezra, "that ther
was a mistake. The Lard would maks
r.oa mistake, Ishmael; but the instru
ments, manâ was they noa mistake
made by them?"
Ishmael looked up.
"Ishmael," said Ezra, "'twas tha
heart of a live bull the Lard told, us
f take."
"Ay, a live bull."
"Ishmael, 13 you sura tha bull
wasn't . dead when you cut tha heart
out?"
Then the old strange light, the light
that might have burned In the
prophets' eyes, shone again In Ish
mael's.
"O Lard," he cried, lifting Â«P his
face, for his faith had been restored,
"great is thy power and marvelous are
thy works!"
Ezra sighed happily, though he was
dying.
So the healer from Far-Away Cove
went back to the north. "The Lard
has not failed me," he said to the peo
ple. "I've failed him. I'll be pre
parln' myself further' â makin' ready
for th* wark. agin* the real time when
I'm called t* do it" He went back
to that far-off desolation, where, in
the dawn and In the dusk, ha might
listen again for the Voice in the hi33
of breaking waters. He sought that
place where. In the thud and crash
of the breaker3, the word might be
spoken. He passed from the in
habited coast to the loneliness of
bleak rocks and a wilderness that the
Lord might speak to him in the silence
cr in the driving gale. Again, in the
evening, when the flush and flare were
upon great clouds, he looked for the
Lord, and for the winging hosts of
angels ascending and descending, as It
is written. There, from day to day,
he waited for the Voice and the Call
And there he died.
celved the urgency of their business he
demanded all that they had; for. said
he, "If the Lard God Almighty keeps
an eye on my bull, 'tis a gran' fine
bull; an' if the Lard sets such a store
by the heart o' the beast, 'twould be
noa moare'n respectful for me t' put a
good price on it." But what cared Ezra?
What cared Mary? What cared the
healer?* What cared Jimmie Lute?
What cared they all when they had the
queer, black powder safe In the jar?
It was a hanny, wonderful hour, in
deed, when the cure was begun.
"T' think o' you bein' strong agin!"
said Mary. "Just f think o' that! Sure
I can hardly bear It, Ezra â I can hard
ly bear the Joy of it."
"The Tierrin' balt'll be comin* In,"
said Ezra, taking the medicine Jar in
his hand to fondle it. "In three weeks
I'll be settin' me nets again. 'Tis
hard t* think it. Ay," he whispered.
" 'tis hard t' brlievp."
Mary was quick to mark his ex
haustionâhia dull stare, the flush, the
rasping breath.
" 'Tis time fcr you t* be goain* t'
bed, b'y." she said softly.
"Ay," he answered, " 'tis time for
you t' help me up. But at this time
o' night come three weeks," he went
on, looking up to her with a smile,
"I'll be snlittin' fish â me own catch,
Mary, me own catch."
. " 'Tis gran' f think it," said she.
There came a night in the fall, with
a gale driving the rain against the
windows of the little room where
Ezra lay, when the man knew that his
hope had been mistaken. Great gusts
t>f wind, breaking from the sea, where
they had swirled and leaped all un
opposed, â¢ shook the house as they
swished past to lash the inland wilder
ness. Inf the intervals, when these
rushing noises fell . away, the night
waÂ« filled with the deep, mighty roar
of the breakers. .Ezra could hardly
lift his voice above it all.
" 'Tis a barb'rous bad night," said
he. .;>V& ;>
The old- healer from Far-Away Cove
sighed. Hia head had fallen over his
breast. He had no heart to look up.
"Ah, Ishmael," said Ezra, a rush of
pity for the broken man making hia
voice quiver and his gray lips trem
ble, "you'll not be gr levin' no moare
because the cure failed. 'Twas all a
mistake, manâ -'twas but a mistake."
"Ay," said Mary, "he've done what
he could."
Ishmael looked up. His face wa3
sallow and haggard. He drew his hand
over his eyes in a dull, helpless way.
."I've_ been .thinkin'," he whispered,
â¢that' I'm nothing .but a misled man."
"Noa, noa," said" Ezra. "The Lord
leads you, Ishmael."
"I'm thinkin'." the healer went on.
"Is it a sure cure, man? Tell
me "
" 'Tis the heart of a bull â the heart
of a black bull with a white face,"
said Ishmael. "Sure I knows noa bull
like that, but they must be one some
where, else the. Lard wouldn't 'a' told
ni( : so." Â¦ Â¦
"They is," Ezra whispered In awe.
" 'Tis' Jacob Swift's bull t' Round
Island. I knows un well. 'Tis a black
bull with a white face.','
"I knowed they was," said Ishmael
o.uietly. "Weri, b'y," he went on, "you
takes the heart from a live black bull
with a^ white face. Then you b'iles un
for tw'o 'days in a black pot. Which
done, you smokes un an' dries un like
a salmon. 'Then you grinds un to
powder â an' -takes un reg'lar in goat's
milk. 'Tis a cure for the decline â
'tis a sure cure!"
"Ay, he's a mean man."
"Man," said Esra. "it must be Jacob
Swift's bull. He've a wonderful white
face, that one!"
"'Tis. que?r,'' Ishmael mused,
"what things the Lard keeps track of.
'Tis queer, new, that he knowed they
v.as a. white-faced bull hereabout â 'ti3
wonderful queer!"
"I wonder what Jacob Swift'll be
arrkin'- for the heart < of - his bull?"
'â¢ 'Twill be so much, I'm thinkin',"
paid Ishmael, "as the whole bull's
wÂ«.;h."
"I've some silver," said Ishmael,
"w hich .would be n part o' the price."
"I've, a punt an' two salmon nets,"
said Ezra. " 'Tis like I can sell un
for something." . . :
"Ezra," said the "wife Mary, coming
through the door, "I've heered you

clasped hands on her bosom, "but I'm â

"Noa, noa,, woman," said Ezra. "I'll
not have you lose a thing your fawther

"But; b'y," said she, "when, you gets
well 'twilhbe easy t' get un back."
"Ay," said Ezra '. softly, '."tis , true.
When I gets well, Mary, I'll buy un
back. I'll buy you two gardens, dear,
when I gets t' the-'ftahin' agin."
"Ah, Ezra," she said; "but 'twill be

Jonn East one clammy dawn, when
they -were hauling the salmon nets eff
â¢Frothy Head. "Sure I've nothin' agin

they's handy t* twenty-seven families
t* the Cove. 'Tis too many for me, b'y.
I feels crowded like. I'll be goan' away,
I'm thinkin' â far away down t' the
Labrador, where 'tis quieter."
Skipper John paused, with the drip
ping .net in his hand. He looked over
the sea to the blue-b]ack waste of rock
and', stunted spruce whither the mist
was driftingâ to that break in the bluff
where the cottages v.ere huddled as
though ' shrinking from the desolation
about. Then he said, with a wise and
solemn wag of his head:
" "Tis a bit crowded, b'y. Maybe,
now, you has the right of it. An' a
m&n must follow his bent."
So, when the salmon run was over,
Ishmael .Roth put all that he had in a
puntâ his net and tackle and Bible and
f.our and pork and seed potatoes and
the like â and set out to discover a new
herbor where he might establish him
eelf in quiet.
"I hates t' leave it." Skipper John,"
he said, as he pushed off from the
Etage. "Sure, I does! I hates wonder
ful t' leave un all. But 'tis gettin' fair
crowded, an' I got t' goa where 'tis
Q^iet. Ies, b'y, I got t' goa.
He called the r.ew harbor Far-Away
Cove. There he lived all alone until he
was old; and he was content, for all of
sea and wiMrrness that the horizon
encompassed was his for elbow room.
â¢"The Lard led me to this place," he
â¢ told himself, by and by. " 'Tis like,
.now, .he'll have some wark for me t"
Co. I'll listenâ I'll listen for his voice!"
In the dav.n and in thâ¢ dusk, when
the gray wind, as it coursed over the
eea, stirred uiÂ» waves to fret his punt,
he listened to the hiss of the waters
lest the Voice sho-uld sound therein. In
the mist, when the punt was hanging
off chore and the sea was beating the
veiled rocks, he sought the Word in
tb.e deep thud and crash of the break
ers. In the night, when the nor'east
E'ale swept from the sea's bleak hid
den placesâ when it pelted the win
dows .with s'.ect c:;d ran like mad into
the wildernessâ he listened for the
Voice- of the Lord, surely expecting it.
By end by. when his Ions hair had
turned white and a strange light was
In his eyes, he heard the Voice of the
Lord, as he kds said, commanding him
to do some rreat thing.
"Sure." thought Ishmael. at Far-
Away Cove, "the Lard He've cailed me
at last. He've slve me a wark t' do."
So Ishmael prepared himself for the
work; this ho did by diligently poring
over an old botli which had come
down to. him from his grandfather,
who, as I believe, had taken it from a
wreck of thore c-Id days. It was "The
Engli'h Physician Enlarged. With
three hundred &. fifty-nine Medicines.
Being an Aftrologo Phyfical Difcourse
of the Vulgar Herbs of this Nation;
Containing a compleat Method of
Ph.yf.ek, whereby a man may preferve
his Ecdy in Health, or Cure himfelf.
being Sick, for Three Pence Charge."
"Sure, the Lard He cast away the
vessel. " Ishmael ftrgued, "an' the Lard
sent my grar.dfather t f the wreck; the
Lard 1 took rr.y grandfather when his
time had come, nor neglected to give
the book Into the hands of my father,
who rave it to me. Sure, 'tis all the
doin' o" th? Lard, whose voice I've
heered in the waves o* the sea an* in
the vi-Ir.d that comes from beyond."
* Jshmael pcred over the book by day
and at r.fght it fashioned strange
dreams for him â vivid dreams, dreams
of lhiÂ» cure cf diseases.
"I am a healer by dreams," he
thought. The consciousness of his
high calling thrilled him. "I am a
healer by dreams," he thought. "The
Lard he've commanded me t* goa
<2own the coast healin* all people."
Whereby you may know that the
things of the wilderness and of the
cullen sea, which are past understand
ing, had undone old Ishmael Roth.
Now, while the healer from Far-
Away Cove came down the coast,
Â¦working strange cures, Ezra Westerly
cf Ragged Harbor trail- ' patiently
for a singular manifestation of the
Lord's favor and great power to heal.
He was= a punt iisherman, was Ezra â
a youns. big-boned man. gigantically
framed, fearless in lop and gusty wind
and t:sed to meeting the 6ea in all the
strength rnd bitterness f of its raging.

ice Roe â a clsety wind, with .frost fol

to Solomon Stride. "I does that. I

"Ay," said Solomon, "they's great

"Just t* touch the weenie finser o'

"If can!y. 'tis," was the wistful re
sponse â *'lf â oanly â 'tis â a son!"
The wife of Thomas Bow of Fortune

a seventh s->n. Great is the favor of the
Loid! said the folk of that place. But
'twas a pity, said they, that 'twas at
the cost of the life cf Amanda Eow, who
was a neighborly woman and a t good
mother. There was a gale abroad That
rightâ a sweeping, swirling wind from
the northwest, where the great gales
are loosed upon the sea.
" 'Tis a ech!" thought Ezra Westerly,
when he was awakened by a great
knocking: on the door at dawn. "Sure,
'tis Jimmie Lute come f tell me the
news."
Again the knocking.
"Ezra! Kzru!"
The consumptive went to the window
and put out his head. "Is it a son f
Fortune Harbor, Jimmie?" he gasped.
The exertion of raising the window had
been too much for him.
"Sure, 'tis," cried Jimmie. "I heerd
un cry afore I come away. Quick, man!
Leave us get started. They fears the
child's a bit"â
A gust of wind put an end to the sen
tence- Ezra shrank from the cold, wet
blast.
With the helD of his wife Ezra
dressed in haste.
'"Tis a son, Mary!" he said again
and again, hysterically repeating it
" 'Tis a son, woman. Think o' that!
'Tis the â¢seventh son of a seventh son."
Haste and hope wrought him into a
high fever of excitem?nt. He could do
nothing to help himself. Petulant ex
clamations broke before him.
"Hut, woman!" he cried, "has you
nothin' but thumbs? That's noa way
t' button a man's galluses!" When he
was helped down to the wharf his
clothes were all awry and his wraps
were falling: from him. Jimmie Lute
lifted him Into the punt and covered
him with a tarpaulin.
"Push off. b'y t ! Push off!" said Ezra.
The punt ran through the narrows to
the sea, where a gray light was spread
ing over the waves. "Drive her, b'y!
Drive her!" said Ezra, Driven she was
âthat stout little punt. "What you
can't carry you can drag," said young
Jimmie Lute between his teeth. But
there was a knowing hand on her sheet
and tiller, for all that; and In a few
hours she reeled into Fortune Harbor,
with a crested wave at her heels, loggy
with shipped water and dripping wet
from stem to stern.
That'll be the house, I'm thinkin'â
that wee white one on the hill, under

"Iss," said Jlmrr.Ie. "The one *with
the crowd at the door. 'Tis where the
child lies."
They met Thomas Bow on the path
up the hill. Ezra was restingâ to catch
his breath and quiet his heart. Thom
as was downcast and bewildered.
"Is you come t' be healed, Ezra?" he
said.
'Iss, b'y. Sure. I've come f touch the

ROMANCE OF THE MAILS.
The envelopes of a whole packet of
letters lust received from Chicago are
being framed preparatory to being
hung In the hall of a fashionable May
fair house. For around these envel
opes hangs an amusing little bit of ro
mance and the raconteur who now
claims their possession holds them as
proof positive of the veracity of his
story) without which he thinks no one
would believe it. For some little time
he has had a maid at his house in
whom all the family took much in
terest, as 'she was a, nice, ingenuous
sort of a girl and did ' her work well.
They knew that she was engaged to be
married to a' young man of a scientific
turn of mind, who was in the employ
of , the leading makers of barometers
and other meteorological instruments
in London. He was sent by his firm to
"No, sir, he's In ' Chicago all the
time and he's. In the same street, but
he seems to move his lodgings every
week, sometimes it's one number and
in the next letter it's another."
"Let me seethe address,' said the
employer, and the girl rushed upstairs,
returning with a packet of her sweet
heart's epistles. Trying hard not to
read the endearing terms with which
the letters commenced the master
glanced at the top of the first page of
some half dozen of them. He found
"Chicago, 78 Fahrenheit" on one, on
another "Chicago, 72 Fahrenheit," on a
third. "Chicago, 80 Fahrenheit" and so
on. This was too much for both mas
ter and mistress. Even the girl's real
distress could not stem their laughter
and the young man of scientific mind
was looked upon Immediately as the
author of one of the finest stories that
could go the rounds. {The meaning of
the word Fahrenheit with the varying
numbers attached was promptly ex
plained to the girl, who In her next
"Oh, that explains it, he's traveling
about the different cities in the States."
TAKES THE TEMPERATURE.
Chicago on business matters and the
lovers were parted. Letters came thick
and fast from Chicago to the maid in
Mayfair and there was no suggestion
of any sort of breach between the two.
But as time went on it was observed
that the girl appeared much per
plexed and worried and the master of
the house finally asked her if anything
was amiss between her and her sweet
heart.
"No, sir," answered the girl, "except
that every letter I have from my young
man says 'Why don't you write?' He
says he hasn't had one letter from me
since he's been In America and I've
written dozens. Directly I receive a
letter I write one back. Twice every
week I've written and he says he
hasn't had one."
"Have you sent them to the proper
address â the address on his letters?"
was the natural inquiry that followed.
"Yes, sir, every time," replied the
maid, "but he seems to be moving
about so much."
letter harked back to the address sup
plied her before her sweetheart left for
the land of the Stars and Stripes.
Now, more than ever, was the fam
ily Interested In their maid, and after
a considerable amount of red tape from
the Dead Letter Office at Chicago has
been returned a whole pile of letters
that had steadily gone on accumulat
ing week by week, addressed to "Mr.
b No. â Fahrenheit. Chicago,
111., U. S. A." As a proof of the whole
story, and to prevent much handling
wearing them out, the envelopes are
now at the framer's being arranged be
hind a sheet of glass.
There could be no more striking
study In contrasts than that presented
by the present Duke of Marlborough
and his renowned ancestor, the victor
of Malplaquet and Blenheim and other
famous battles. Between the short,
slight figure and bovlsh physiognomy
of the former and the stalwart form
and strong handsome countenance of
the great soldier there Is nothing sug
gestive of even remote / relationship.
Like the Duke of Wellington, th,e hus
band of Consuelo Vanderbilt holds his
ancestral estates on condition that a
"tenure flag" is presented every year
to his sovereign. Stimulated by his
American wife's ambition, he strives
hard to amount to something in public
life, and, the standard by which peers
are measured In these days not being
a very high one, he succeeds fairlywell.
But It is his cousin, Winston Churchill,
who inherits most of the brains of the
, family. - Â§Â£Â£Â£ >^
Though occasionally availing himself
of his privileges as a membor of the
House of Lords, Lord Byron has never
taken part In its discussions. He af
filiates with the Tories, but on Glad
stone's Home Rule bill went into the
lobby against his party. When asked
to explain his action he replied that he
had made up his mind never to cast a
vote against a measure favorable to
the Irish people because the Irish poet
Moore had defended his illustrious
namesake.
He is not a lineal descendant of the
poet, who, as Is well known, died with
out Issue. The poet was the sixth
Baron to inherit the title. The present
Lord Byron Is the son of the second
son of the seventh Baron, and succeed
ed his uncle, the eighth Baron, in 1870,
at which time he was only fifteen. He
doesn't look a bit like his Illustrious
namesake. In appearanoe he Is a dark,
dapper man of medium height with a
slight mustache and hair once black
now abundantly tinged with gray. He
cares nothing for sports and derives
his sola outdoor amusements from long
walks and occasional bicycle rides.

The Earl is now 70 years old and
has always been a steady-going, emi
nently respectable sort of man. He

Trafalgar House, near Salisbury, which,
with the surrounding estate, was pur
chased for $400,000 by the trustees of

the great admiral. His heir. Viscount
Trafalgar, who is in his fiftieth year,
will not. however, succeed to the pen
sion of $25,000 a year which a grateful
nation voted to the first Earl, for its
duration is limited to ' three lives.
Strong religious tendencies character
ize all the members of the family. One
eon holds the rectory of Shaw.
Lord Byron is another peer who has
inherited an illustrious name wjth none
of the genius which made that name
famous. Like the poet, however, he
awakened suddenly one day to find
himself famous. That happened a few
years ago when his heavy loans to a
certain Mrs. Howard Kingscote formed
the subject of Inquiry in the bank
ruptcy court. On that occasion a let
ter was read from the woman who had
got him icto the mess, in which she
wrote; ".You can go bankrupt or not
parsonâ his father being vicar of Burn
ham Thorpe In Norfolk. It is quite
natural, therefore, that the clerical
strain should predominate in the pres
ent holder of the titles and estates, who
has long been conspicuous at church
congressesâ and conspicuous In little
else. The fighting blood in the family,
which missed him, came out strong in
his younger brother, Maurice Horatio
Nelson, who entered the navy when a
youngster of 13 and rose to be a rear
admiral before he retired.
In one respect, however. Earl Nelson
resembles the first and famous Nelson.
The latter, despite the fact that for
long years his home was on the rolling
deep, suffered, as his biographers re
cord, greatly from sea-sickness. And
Neptune exacts the same tribute from
this third Earl if ever he ventures on
salt water when the sea Is a bit rough.
For that reason, perhaps, he has al
ways stuck pretty close to dry land.
EMINENTLY RESPECTABLE.
A striking recognition of the dangers
Involved In bringing a chauffeur lntÂ»
the^nousehold is afforded by an adver
tisement for a motor car driver which
recently appeared in which It was
stated "only plain looking men need
apply." Time was when, among the
servants, coachmen had far the best
opportunities for capturing romantic
heiresses and that they hava not failed
to make the most of their chances
numerous society scandals attest. But
now the chauffeur is distinctly ahead
of the Jehu In playing this sort of
game with Cupid, despite the fact that
he is often required to wear goggles
and a hideous mask. It would seem
that the exhilaration of "moting** ex
ercises a peculiar psychological influ
ence over susceptible feminine hearts.
The London smart set is eagerly
awaiting developments In the case of
Miss Baldock. who still stubbornly
clings to her determination to marry
her handsome chauffeur. Sh# only re
cently passed her twenty-first birth
day and has an Income of $5000 a year,
with expectations, bound to.be realized
If she lives, of inheriting an additional
$75,000 a year. This may perhaps ac
count for th<Â» fact that the chauffeur
has refused an offer made by the girl'i
father of $30,000 cash down to call the
match off and exile himself until the
young girl has outgrown her infatua
tion for him. He will come of age In
September, and the girl has so far
yielded to strenuous persuasion as to
consent to the postponement of the
marriage until October, but stoutly
protests that she will make no further
concessions to her parents' feelings'.
The father has Issued his ultimatum
to the effect that the day she leaves
her home to become the bride of the
chauffeur Its doors will be closed
against her forever and he will never
see her again. The anguished mother's
pleadings have proved futile to move
either of them.
Now that every family Influence that
could be brought to bear upon the girl
to induce her to change her mind has
been tried and failed, common sens*
friends are suggesting to her parents
that they should make the best of the
matter. "She is bound to marry the
chauffeur and you cannot prevent her."
they say, "but you could no doubt get
her consent to- the stipulation that she
take him abroad for two or three years
and hava him educated there and
trained in the usages of polite society.
People have short memories In London
and well dressed and wen behaved,
with a handsome face and figure, ha
will experience no difficulty in being
received In society, especially If he
spends money freely. **
But the stern father will not agree
to any such compromise. Though tha
proposition Is a novel one. as far as
dealing with a husband is concerned.
It has its counterpart In several In
stances that could be cited In which
men hava married pretty girls In
humble circumstances. sent them
abroad and put them in the hands of
society polishers, with such excellent
results that on their return they have
been able to take their places along
side of their husbands and make so
breaks that would betray their lowly
origin.
LONDON, Aug. 20.â In fashionable
circles, where susceptible heiresses and
emotional younj; matrons abound, the
chauffeur is fast coming to be regarded
as more dangerous to society than tha
vehicle which he controls, despite the
fact that one paper has dubbed it the
"murder car." Hardlv a week passes
by in which he does not figure in soma
tragic romance. Only a few days ago
two chauffeurs were cited in a divorce
case which revealed a blighted home
and an honored name besmirched.
About the same time a pretty debu
tante was found drowned in a lake.
A letter which she had left explaining
her reasons for committing suicide was
destroyed by her guardian that its con
tents might not be made public. But.
as Is well known among friends of tha
family, she stated in this epistle that
she had fallen in love with the chauf
feur and no longer had the courage to
face life, having discovered that he was
not only a married man with children.
but after winning her affections ha
had been base enough to show the let
ters she had written him to other ser
vants of the household.
It would be difficult to flnd a man in
appearance, tastes and temperaments
more unlike England's greatest Ad
miral than the present Earl Nelson. He
is the son of Nelson's brother, the cler
gyman, who, after the death of the na
tional hero at Trafalgar, succeeded to
the title. Nelson himself, as Is of
course well known, was the son cf a
The eldest son and heir, the Marquis
of Douro, is now 28 years old and still
unmarried. It would surprise no one
if he should some day emulate the ex
ample of the Duke of Marlborough and
replenish the family exchequer by wed
ding an American heiress. Among his
artetocratie associates in the Guards he
is not popular, for no better reason
probably than that he takes the profes
sion of a soldier seriously. They have
nicknamed him "Do-go" and not long
Eince treated him to a severe "rag
ging." which is English for "hazing."
pajresent of it ceased on the death of
the third Duke. Thus it came about
Â» hen the present Duke took possession
<>f the family property of about 19,000
acres he was deprived of this source
of income. With considerably less
in^ans than had been enjoyed by his
predecessors he was further embar
rassed by the obligation to pay allow
ances out of the estate to the surviving
widows of the second and third Dukes.
HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET.
It is no secret that with a large fam
ily the Duke has had a hard time of it
to make both ends meet. Although as
a disciple of Mars in his younger days
he displayed few of those talents which
distinguished the conqueror of Na
poleon, rumor has it that among the
swells in the Guards he contracted an
expensive taste for card playing, from
the cenrequences of which his purse
still suffers. HowevÂ«r that may be,
the necessity for retrenchment com
pelled hltn some time ago to seek a
tenant for the Etrathfieldsaye estate,
around which linger so many memo
ries of the national hero, but he has not
yet succeeded In letting it. And though
It has never been openly placed on
the market It has more than once bean
reported that his Grace of "Wellington
"was trying to let or sell Apeley House,
the famous town residence of the vic
tor of Waterloo. Indeed it has been
stated that on one occasion he had
nearly concluded arrangements for its
Eale to a South African millionaire
with Eocial ambitions, when some rich
friends, thinking that the place should
be preserved as a sort of national heir
loom, contributed enough between
them to tide the Duke over his pecuni
ary difficulties. When in town the
Duke ar.d Duchess reside at Apsley
House In very quiet style and do little
entertaining, for It is well understood
among their aristocratic friends that
they cannot afford swell balls and din
ner parties. In fact Arthur Charles
Wellesley finds that being a Duke
Isn't what It Is cracked up to be by a
long shotâ especially when there is no
big bank account to back it up. His
natural tastes are those of a country
squire and he finds his chief delight
in hunting and shooting. He has a
preat aversion to public functions and
avoids them as much as possible. Also
he has a great dislike to being photo
graphed, probably because he does not
care to advertise the striking dissimi
larity between his own physiognomy
and that of his great ancestor with

"Like fairy stories," Martine de

~TW0 ST'AGE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN APPEARING AT THE CENTRAL.
PARIS, Aug. 20. â Americans who
have visited Paris will recall an ex
ceedingly expert woman rider at th*
Nouveau Cirque, who astonished tha
public every evening by her clever rid
ing and was billed as the Bareness da
Rhoden.
She was a real Baroness. She was
born in Breslau, the daughter of a well
to-do German stock broker, and when
she was about 17 her father committed
suicide because he failed in business.
She was left penniless and had only one
resource. She wa3 a_ good rider and
found an engagement at Riga, But the
persons who engaged her* refused to
pay her anything, saying she was serv
ing her apprenticeship. A reputable
newspaper which took up her cause got
her a position in St. Petersburg. Thera
her success began.
In the height of It Baron Oscar
Vladimir von Wradren, of a noble fam
ily of Eothoma, fell In love with her.
Being impetuous the Baron's wooins'
was short and they were married at
once. His fortunes were ruined and as
she would not consent to leave the cir
cus, both became riders.
He was very Jealous and had several
duels over what he deemed affronts to
his wife. Lieutenant de Castenchold ho
shot dead, when the latter tried to>
strike him with a cane. The Baroness
saw It and never recovered from th*
horror it caused her.
Later she came to Paris, appearing
both at Nouveau Cirque and thÂ» Fblles
Bergeres. One feat haa never been
achieved by another rider. She drew
her horse upon his hind feet and threw
herself back, lying down until her head
touched the croup.
The Baron died and the Baroness
continued her career, resting from tima
to time.
One day the maid went to tJÂ»Â« Ba
roness* room at 9 o'clock In thÂ« morn
ing to throw open the blinds.
"It Is night," the Baroress ex
claimed.
"No. madame, tha room la full ofl
sunshine."
Then the Baroness knew that sha
had been stricken blind. Nevertheless
she rode that very night and was
thrown against a post so heavily that
she sustained serious injury. She dis
appeared from public view and it was
long before the reason was known. Now
she has taken up another career, being
a woman cf remarkable energy and
force oi character. ... â¢!
She went to a teacher of singing. Mr.
Roman!, whom she had known at tha
Bergeres. He was touched to see her
In so sad a plight and asked her If she
could sing. She said she could and
sang for him. Her voice is strong and
sympathetic and she has progressed so
rapidly in her music studies that she
will sing this winter In drawing-rooms.

Oh, no, I knowâ I'd rather go in swim

"Of course you would," I said. "And
how did you learn to act?"
"Came by me natural," Miss Cooper
said unshyly.
"Me too." remarked Baby Martine.
"Do you go to school?"
"I've Just played a beautiful part In
'Jim Bludsoe,' down in Los Angeles,
too, Little Britches. I had a good part
in 'One Summer Day,' Just lately at
the Alcazar."
"Fauntleroy for one." she replied:
"Yes, I do," Miss Cooper decided. She
has a quick, boyish laugh, the gestures
of a boy, sometimes the boy voice.
"What kind of thing do you want to
do when you grow up?"
"Like Miss Roberts does," Ollie said.
"Miss Roberts does so many kinds
of things," I remarked. *-â¢ ,
"That's the reason," Miss Cooper put
it.
"And what are your favorite parts
now?"
it-" .
"I think possibly if you saw Â«ome of
the comedies at the Columbia you
would enjoy them," I suggested.
"I've never been to the Columbia,"
she informed me.
"And what are we going to do when
we grow up?" I asked.
"Well, I want to be a leading lady, of
course." Martine Baid, drawing up her
little white neck. "I don't want to
play parts ' like Zaza and Sappho,
though. I haven't seen them, but I've
heard people talk about them. I like
most of the plays I've seen here. I was
in an awful .one last week, though â
'Just Struck Town.' But that was at
the California.
"And what else have you been in?"
I began to feel extremely young with
that experienced little soul beside me.
"Oh, I've done Little Eva, and I cre
ated the part of Chan Toy in 'The
First Born' â we're going to do that
here in a week or two," the tiny mum
mer said. She blushed then, as with
en artist's shame, she asked me if I
knew that she had been in "The Toy
maker." "I was, but I wouldn't tell
anybody, though. I was the Little Bo-
Peep on top of the drum. I hadn't a
word to say! â Oh, here's Ollie!"
And Ollie, rosy-cheeked, boyish, burst
into the room, the picture man follow
ing her. The children posed themselves
in the big chair, Ollie, with her big,
saucy blue eyes, saucy upturned nose,
golden locks topped by a red Tarn, and
Bailor blue serge suit, a complete foil
in character to the other little one. I
noted afresh the purple-veined tem
ples of the other child, the fine, long
chin, the bulge of the brow, the small,
fine nose and mouth, the accurate oval
of the face.
She was saying: "I've only had a bit
of cake to eat all day, Ollie."
Ollie laughed: "And 1 couldn't eat
anything myself but two eggs, two
slices of bacon, a plate of buttered
toast and â oh, fried potatoes and cof
fee. And I had "em in bed! That's
what you get for being up late"â to me.
"Oh, is it?" I said.
"I'm fond of eggs," she laughed. "Do
you know â oh. my sister, that's Geor
gie Cooper, she used to send me to the
theater with eggs Â«nd milk and lemon
beaten up together for my brother-in
lawâthat's Landers Stevens. It's de
licious," and Miss Ollie smacked ap
proving lips. "Well, Landers used to
notice that it got less every day. He
only laughed, though. But It's real
good â do you good. Teeny" â to Miss
Martine.
"Martine doesn't like eggs, or com
edy." I began. "I'm sure you do?"
There, Mr. Fischer!
"But that is burlesque at Fischer's,
not comedy," I explained respectfully.
"Oh, burlesque, you call it," she said;
"well, I don't like It, whatever you call
"I let the cat play with 'em. And I
play with the cat. It's name's 4 Be
delia.' It's a beauty. Â»
"Oh, you heard Elizabeth Murray
sing 'Bedelia?' I said.
"No," she said, "it was Frances Starr
at the Alcazar â in 'The Moth and tha
Flame,' you know. I played the little
boy. It isn't a good part. I hadn't
anything to do. That was one of my
parts."
"That" was a picture of Baby Mar
tine on the mantelpiece, posed with
Juliet Crosby in "Madame Butterfly,"
a tiny, tottering baby.
"Why, do you remember that?" I
cried.
"I remember just the line ehe-said,"
prattled the child. " 'See, blue eyes,
fair hair. Just like father, him my
baby trouble.' "
She was 3 years old then. .V '
"And you don't like comedy?" I
asked, pushing the candy over to her.
She took a "hard chocolate" quietly
and said again: "No, I went" to
Fischer's one night with papa and
mamma. They sat there Just laugh
ing and laughing. I put my head on
mamma's lap and went to sleep. I
thought it was the silliest old thing I
ever eaw. It was called 'Fiddle Dee
Dee.' "
Was it really the tiny, white- f rocked
baby at my side talking? Just as I have
written, word for word, the childish
voice was piping away. Do you re
member that I said Baby Martine was
6 years old?- She was chattering of dolls
when I heard her again.
"I never play with dolls," she said.
it is often the mother's fault when the
children get 'sassy.' They tell them
that they will punish them If they do
certain things and "
"And the children do them and their
mammas don't punish them," continued
the child. "They let 'em grow 'sassy.'
It is all right if you stop 'em when
they are little!"
"You remain here while I go to my
hotel and get some money," said Evans.
Bulger did as he was told and amused
himself for two hours waiting for
Evans to return. Finally he was so
sleepy that he decided to confess to the
proprietor that he had no money.
"I am waiting for my friend to come
back with some money," explained
Bulger when the proprietor said it
was necessary to close the place at
daylight. â¢
"Your friend paid the check when he
went out two hours agu," said the
proprietor; .
Two of Henry W. Savage's leading
comedians, Charles E. Evans of "The
Sho Gun" and Harry Bulger of "Wood
land," are spending their spare time
In Boston playing jokes on each other.
One evening last week, after a per
pormance of "Woodland," Bulger
sought Evans, who had Just finished a
rehearsal of the Ade-Luders opera, and
a game of billiards was proposed. The
game started shortly after 11 o'clock,
and about 2 o'clock in the morning
Bulger confided to Evans that he was
without funds.
\ "You'll have to pay the check," Bul
ger said.
The other comedian had a large sum
of money, but he couldn't resist the
temptation to play a joke on his friend.
"Well, we're up against it," said
Evans with a twinkle In his eye. "I
haven't a cent either."
"What will we do?" asked Bulger;
"the proprietor will surely call the po
lice and we will be arrested."
Consistent with Mr. Belasco's estab
lished policy not to give out in advance
the story or nature of new productions,
nothing is announced concerning "The
Music Master" further than that it
will show Mr. Warfleld in an entirely
novel character, radically different
from any in which he has been seen
heretofore.
Mr. Warfield's first production of
"The Music Master" will take place at
Atlantic City, Monday, September 12.
He will open in New York at the Be
lasco Theater, Monday, September 26.
The title of David Warfleld's new
play is "The Music Master." It is In
three acts, and its author is Charles
Klein, who wrote the same star's pre
vious success, "The Auctioneer."
"The Music Master" went into re
hearsal at the Belasco Theater last
Thursday morning, under the super
vision of Mr. Belasco. Mr. Warfleld's
company will be one of the strongest
to be seen in New York this season.
The cast will include Marie Bates,
Minnie Dupree, Antoinette Walker, Isa
bel Waldron, Sybil Klein, Campbell
Collan, Archie Boyd, William Boag,
Harold Mead, Carrington Tates, J. W.
Benson, H. G. Charlton, Louis Ver
ande, W. G. Ricciardi. Leon Kohlmar
and several others.
Sir Henry Irving promises to appear
in a new role when he makes his fare
well tour of this country next spring.
Probably the last part he will ever
create will be that of "Gran'father
Coquesne," in a little one-act tragedy
built on Cosmos Hamilton's story or
that name in the Smart Set for Sep
tember. Mr. Hamilton, a young Eng
lish author, who has come into sud
den fame, has made the dramatic ver
sion of his story at Sir Henry's re
quest.

If the past disastrous season has
done nothing else it has at least re
duced these two theatrical impositions
to their proper level. And I make this
statement in all kindness, too, for no
one knows better than I the cease
less toil, the unselfish devotion, the in
domitable perseverance and the
heart-breaking setbacks which many
actresses and some few actors are ex
periencing in their struggle to reach
the top of the ladder and to maintain
their position there.
The stage in America to-day is
stagnant on account of the commer
cial spirit which has been Introduced
into its dealings during the last six
or seven years. No one appreciates
and deplores this fact more than the
actors themselves â and no one â
more's the pity â is so afraid to say
eo. If the actors are under a yoke of
commercial tyranny to-day they have
themselves to blame for it. There was
a time seven years ago, when the
theatrical syndicate was first formed,
that Messrs. Joseph Jefferson, Nat
Goodwin, Richard Mansfield, Francis
Wilson and W. H. Crane, by merely
standing shoulder to shoulder, could
have nipped the scheme in its bud.
To-day, much as any of them private
ly and unofficially may bemoan this
fact, there isn't one of them -who
doesn't Jump when the syndicate pulls
the string. â David Belasco, in Septem
ber Smart Set.
the managers, to be sure, it has been
a bitter experience, but it has taught
them, I think, a much needed lesson.
They realize that the public Is no
longer to be taken In by "flubdub";
the bitter truth has been borne In on
many of us that the dear old public
will no longer swallow buncombe
whole. For four or five years the
country enjoyed a period of exception
al prosperity. The people were more
or less theater mad. Plays good, bad
and indifferent attracted large audi
ences, their managers made money
hand over fist. But with last season
the tide turned.
The first victim and the one that
most richly deserved its fate was tho
badly dramatized novel. The public
absolutely refused to swallow any
more of these crude and Inchoate con
coctions dramatized overnight and lit
erally chucked upon the stage after a
couple of weeks' rehearsals.
The next in line to suffer was the
made to order star â the man or
woman who, after one or two suc
cesses in leading roles, suddenly blos
somed out as a would-be arc light in
the theatrical firmament.

Those who remember the Kopta
chamber music concerts of last season
will be more than pleased to learn that
Mr. Kopta is contemplating another
series for this season. The Kopta con
certs were among the most notable in
local chamber music annals. As an
ensemble leader Mr. Kopta himself is
pre-eminently gifted, and* his associates
were all admirablv chosen. The dis
covery of Mrs. Oscar Mansfeldt, who
takes charge of the piano end of things,
as an ensemble player of exceptional
capacity, was one of the pleasantest
features of the last season. The other
strings, besides the brilliant Kopta
ones, were all equally characteristic.
Character, indeed, tone, individuality,
were evident in unusual proportion in
the work of the quartet, in addition to
large promise of ensemble sympathies
of the strongest. The programmes pur
posed are of the same interesting na
ture as those of last season, and con
tain several novelties. Here they are:
. "But when they get older and sassy
they don't like *hem so well. Hopo I
may dip Jf I get sassy â but perhaps I
am now, and don't know it."
Seriously, as the email philosopher in
front of me, I said: "I'm not sure. But
â¢'Sometimes," I said.
Martine continued: "All mothers, -I
think, like their children when they're
fresb â new* 1 mean. Don't you think
feO?" * ~A>~ -^
I nodded, for I- dare not speak a
yes. :?z "
"Mamma Â¦was bathing me between
every act last night with alcohol. Chil
dren are a- nuisance, aren't they?"
"Ead part*." said the infant Duse.
She perked up her tiny chin and added:
"I don't like comedy. I prefer the
emotional."
. Seriously as I could I asked her:
"What, for example?"
"I like my part in 'Editha's Burglar'
best of all," she decided. "It's a long
part â twelve typewritten sides. And
Â¦what do you think? I couldn't under
stand It. One night when I was play
ing In the piece I saw a lady with two
little girls In one of the boxes. She was
crying like everything, and the two lit
tle girls were giggling, giggling, gjg
1 gling. Why do you think that was?"
I gave It up and asked if she often
looked at the audience.
Martine sunk the delicate oval of
her cheeks In her hands and said: "No.
I don't, because I get out of my part
If I do. Now, I know that papa and
mamma are to be in the audience to
night. Really, I'm scared to death. I
just know that I am not going to act
Â¦well. I never do if I think of the audi
ence."
Then Martine told me that her "real
"papa* was a chronic invalid, that her
"real mamir.a" was dead, but that her
Uncle and Aunt Leavy were "just as
"gtÂ»od" and how she loved them.
' *- "Ob. my cold," she sniffed.-?-* â¢
"Not when I play, of course," she
caid. munching: cozily. "I've been to
school only about two months, but I
know all the big letters and the little
lettersâ they're beside 'em, and I can
spell eome. Mamma says when I'm
too big for child's parts and too little
for soubrettes I'm going to school."
"What do you like to play best?"
'Tm not hungTy, to-day," eald the
little one. 'Tve a cold, you see. I
don't mind a hard chocolate, though,
thank you."
"How old are you?"
"I shall toe eÂ«ven on October 15," the
child said, daintily lifting out a "hard
chocolate" between her tiny finger and
thumb:
"Do you go to school?"
. .^aby. Martine was there before me.
Fragile as a harebell, flaxen-haired.
Mue-eyed, the tiny maiden stood In the
mftist of us. There were four tall men,
,the wholesome-eyed and hearted aunt,
who mothers llartine, Maggie Francis
Loavy, and myself around her. As
flje put her baby hand out to me â
well, I just wanted to carry her away.
Instead.- 1 pulled out a box of French
rh;xed and tucked my arm around her.
They left Baby Martine and myself
to talk It out. It was entirely evident
that .Martine might walk over the
Â» hole lot of them if she so wished. She
ran after her aunt to kiss her good-by,
as for a moment Mrs. Leavy stopped to
gossip. She told me how the little
girl will "get her a cup of tea and
toast" as well as she can herself. How
the child will not permit any one else
to sign her checks. How one day there
c&me .a manager to the house to en
gage Martine, and Martine "en

look much like an actress, but mamma
had not had time to dress her." and bo

"Candy?" I said, when they were
gone.
; It was in no spirit of moral reform
that I wandered up to the Central last
Monday evening. It was. In fact, to
baf k in the great, white goodness of
the heroine of "For Her Children's
Sake." Whenever I get to thinking
tha o t my neighbor isn't all he should be
I Co up to the Central. Whenever I
get to doirbtlr.gr the lovely all-through
Istrr.p-black villainy of him I also go
up 'to the Central. For there, to para
phraseâ
"When he is good, he Is. very, very
good,
.4r.d when he is bad he is horrid '."
Fo I wont up to see what she did for
her children's sake. On the billboards
she drops v. ith "a sickening thud" from
& 'circus horse. I. hoped to see that.
'And the children, in tlitir little white
nighties, I hoped tÂ» see them. They
cheated us on the sickening thud. The
thudding takes place behind ' scenes.
Instead, you set the lady on a stretch
er. e!1 bluesy from the effects. But the
children were there. Their little white
nighties were there. And the rest,
Â¦therefore this story is written.
Be it preluded that 1 am no Gerryite.
Quite the contrary, in" fact, My ac
quaintance with the lives of stage chil
dren, from those cf the pantomime
fairies of London's East End to those
of m little Ollie Cooper and Baby Mar
tine at the Central, leads me to entirely
opposite conclusions from those of Mr.
. Better fed. better clad, better
housed, better educated, and. above atl.
better loved than the rest of its class,
I find the stage child. For, not like the

Engagement cups! What a silly fad!
Why must every sane girl send a cup
and saucer to her betrothed friend?
Why not a soup plate or dinner plate?
âoh, anything that would break that
maddening monotony of cups and sau
cers.
I am reliably informed that one fian
cee has been presented with seventy
cups. Ye gods! Seventy girls walking
up to her coyly and with solemn ad
herence to a fool custom, presenting
her with seventy cups and saucers!
Isn't it a wonder she didn't lose her
balance with, say, the thirtieth or for
tieth, and scream? It seems not un
like a mockery.
Can some one decipher a defense for
the custom? Is there any hidden
poetry or sentiment underlying it? If
not, O maids, try a kitchen or a linen
shower or a glass showerâ or any old
thing but the maddening cups and
saucers.
And then â there's thÂ» equally exas
perating medium by which a maid's
popularity Is measured. No cups, no
popularity. Seventy cups! Fine!
It wouldn't be a bad scheme to ap
pend to an engagement announcement
â "Kindly omit cuds." Just as many
do now in funeral notices when they
add, "Kindly omit flowers."
Another California maiden has been
won by a foreign missionary â Mrs.
John Erdman, formerly pretty Marian
Dillingham, a famous belle of Hono
lulu.
The romance had Its inception In the
Isle of Palms, when the Rev. John
Erdman tarried there on his way to
Japan, his chosen field of endeavor.
And when he went he carried beneath
his cassock the heart of pretty Mis3
Dillingham, whose father is one of the
rocate entertainment. Of course there
are to this question the proverbial two
sidesâ the men's side and the host
esses'. And I must confess my leaning
toward the men's, who claim with
much show of truth that they often
accept invitations to affairs- that bore
them Inexpressibly, arid they would
much prefer to stay home," visit the
club or do some congenial thing.- But
they realize how flat a thing a manless
affair is, and they go â partly through
sympathy and' partly through coward
ice, being afraid of giving offense to
a hostess of power.

rounding a sharp turn, the chauffeur
allowed the machine to run Into the

capsize It.
Violently twisting the crank In the
opposite direction to counteract this,
the automobile received an impetus
which, before It could be checked, car

Drew, Baggageman William Arts and
Conductor- Tom Hunt, left San Fran
cisco this afternoon filled mainly with
delegates to the. conventions at Santa
Cruz. The orders to the crew were to
pass the excursion train at Alma sta
tion. Evidently there was a misunder
standing, the crew of the narrow gauge
train apparently being of " the opinion
that the excursion train was In but one
section, when, in fact, it -was In- two.
The first section was passed safely and
the trains proceeded on their way.
While crossing Los Gatos Creek at
slow ; speed the- crew" of the narrow
gauge train saw the second' section of
the excursion train approaching 1 in the
opposite direction. Whistles were
blown and brakes reversed, but to no
purpose. With a resounding crash the
iron monsters came together. The Jar
was terrific. Men , and women \yere
thrown f roiij their seats arid inside the
two trains pandemonium reigned.'
Above the sound of escaping steam
And the grinding of Iron against iron,
as the engines tore into each other's
vitals, -could be heard the piercing
shrieks of women as they clasped their
frightened children to their breasts.
So great was the force of the collis
ion that each locomotive practically
telescoped the other, and the seats In
the broad-gauge train were torn from
their fastenings. The trains were both
oil burners and the flaming liquid was
thrown about, but fortunately, did not
set fire to the wreck..
As In all disasters of a like nature,
heroes were made In a moment. Men
freely volunteered their services In
helping the injured and carrying them
from tha wreck. The cooler headed
women present looked after their faint
ing sisters or soothed the walls of chil
dren, alarmed at the disastrous end to
their day of pleasure.
Considering the danger to which the
party was exposed, the casualty list
Is very small. Physicians arrived on
the scer.e soon after the crash and
tendered their services to the suffering.
While all on board both trains suffered
severely from the shaking up, those
most seriously injured were as fol

CHEFU, Aug. 20.â The steamship
Pechlli, just arrived here, was . over
hauled and boarded by a Japanese de
stroyer and five, torpedo-boats six
miles off Liapshan last night. An offi
cer from the destroyer stayed on board
for forty minutes conversing with the
Japanese Consul to Newchwang, who
was a passenger, for Chefu. The sounds
of firing were so heavy occasionally
that conversation was difficult. The
Japanese explained that they were
shelling the Russian positions with the
utmost vigor, preparing for an assault
to-day toward daybreak. . When, the
Pechili was permitted to proceed on
her course the firing was at its heavi
est, and it was believed to Indicate the
imminence of a general assault.
Ijuin, the Japanese Consul General at
Tientsin, who arrived here to-day on
the Pechill, says that to-day's battle,
which began at daybreak, is directed
against the fortress itself. It Is taking
place along the entire line, and It is Ja
pan's supreme effort, to which the re
cent battles were but preliminary con
tests. He added:
"I firmly believe that you can safely
say that Port Arthur will soon be in
our hands. One after the other of the
outer defenses has been taken by the
Japanese and the latter have completed
their preparations for the grand as

The selection of Emperor William
and King Edward to be godfathers of
the heir to the Russian throne has
created an excellent Impression and i3
considered to be an especially happy
omen of the future relations between
Russia and Great Britain. Both Prince
Henry of Prussia and Prince Louis of
Battenberg, personal representatives of
their respective sovereigns, are under
stood to be bearers of letters to Em
peror Nicholas. King Edward's delega
tion of Prince Louis of Battenberg to
be his representative is considered to
have special significance in view of the
issues which have arisen between the
two countries over maritime law.* As
chief of the naval Intelligence depart
ment of the British navy, Prince Louis
will be in a position to discuss contro
verted questions with the Emperor.
"I direct you to congratulate In my

FUTURE CZAR'S GODFATHERS.
Private information coming from
Port Arthur by way of Chinese Junks
says that when the Japanese sent In
the flag of 'truce on Friday they con
veyed a message to both the general
commanding the fortress and the ad
miral commanding the squadron.
Â¦ According to the Admiralty's Infor
mation the battleship Retvlzan was the
most unlucky ship In the harbor be
fore the Bortie of August 10. Out of 133
shells entering the town five struck the
Retvizan, wounding her captain and
three other officers. She was also the
only ship hit when the Japanese fired
over Liaoti Mountain, the 'extreme
southern part of the Kwangtung Pen
insula, during the earlier stages of the
operations.
The Emperor has telegraphed to Lieu
tenant General Stoessel, in command
of the military forces at Port Arthur,
as follows:
SHELLS DAMAGE RETVIZAN.
the positions at Palungchang, whence
they had been bombarding the forts of
Port Arthur, was received with con
siderable gratification at the War
Office, where it > was regarded as
evidence that the defenders are strong
enough to take the offensive when the
occasion demands. For this reason the
War Office Is not inclined to credit the
reports that the Japanese have cap
tured forts No. 3 and No. 4, five miles
northeast of Port Arthur. It is admit
ted that the possession of these forts
would render the situation of the be
siegers desperate.
The War Office has official Informa
tion from the fortress up to August 8,
9 and 10. This report tells of the des
perate character of the Japanese at
tacks, which continued practically
without intermission for ' forty hours.
General Stoessel's report after the as
saults of August 14 and 15 is expected
at any hour.
"At Shanghai, at the beginning of
the war, the Russian gunboat Mand
jur, in defiance of China's neutrality,
remained in the port for weeks after
receiving notice to leave*. Finally, af

and the destroyer Grozovol have now
CITES MANDJTR INCIDENT.
**A Russian warship from Port Ar
thur sought in the harbor of Chefu
asylum from attack, which her home
port had ceased to afford her. In
taking that step she was guilty of a
breach of the neutrality of China, as
established by the agreement of the
belligerents, and Japan was fully jus
tified in regarding the harbor of Che
fu as belligerent, so far as the inci
dent In question was concerned. With
the determination oX the incident the
neutrality of the port was revived.
"The action taken by Japan at Che
fu was a direct natural consequence of
Russia's disregard of her engagement,
but it is not alone in this matter, nor
alone in Chefu, that Russia has flag
rantly violated China's neutrality and
ignored her own engagement. Shortly
aft<=r the investment and isolation of
Port Arthur a system of wireless tel
ajrraphy was installed between the be
leaguered fortress and the Russian
consulate at Chefu. The system is
still in operation, notwithstanding the
repeated- protest of the Japanese Gov
ernment.
**In other words, the Japanese Gov
ernment holds that China's neutrality
is imperfect and applicable only to
those places which are not occupied
by the armed forces of either belliger
ent, and Russia cannot escape the
consequences of an unsuccessful war
by moving its army or navy into those
portions of China which by arrange
ment had been made conditionally
neutral.
"The Japanese Government engaged
to respect the neutrality of China out-
Bide of the regions actually involved
in war, provided that Russia made a
Blmilar engagement and carried it cut
in good faith. The Japanese Govern
ment considered that they were pre
cluded by this engagement from occu
pying or making use for warlike pur
poses of any kind of territory or ports
of China outside of the zone which had
been made the theater of war. because
It seemed to them that any such occu
pation would *ipso facto* convert the
places thus occupied and used from
neutral to belligerent territory. It
equally seemed to them that any such
occupation and use of neutral Chinese
territory or ports by the Russian forces
would give effect to the proviso in the
Japanese engagement and justify her
in considering: territory or ports so oc
cupied and used as belligerent.
RUSSIA BREAKS FAITH.
TOKIO. AuÂ«. 20.â The Japanese Gov
ernment to-day save to the press a
statement defining its attitude In the
capture cf the Ryeshitelni and declar
ing: its position on the entire question
of Chinese neutrality, as follows:
"The status of China in the present
struggle is wholly unique. Nearly all
of the military operations are carried
on within her borders. She is not a
party to the conflict, nevertheless her
territories are in part belligerent and
in part neutral. That condition of
things, in the contemplation of interna
tional law, is an anomaly and a con
tradiction. In this case it is a creature
of a special understanding to which
the belligerents have given adhesion,
with a view to limiting the area of
hostilities In the interest of foreign in
tercourse and the general tranquillity
of China.
"The reports of the Japanese and
Russian officers who took part in the
Chefu incident agree that the Rye
shitelni was the aggressor and the first
to commence the hostilities which re
sulted in her capture. This fact would,
the Japanese Government believe, de
prive Russia of any grounds for com
plaint which she might possess if the
lawfulness of the capture were other
wise in doubt. In this respect the
case resembles the case of the Ameri
can privateer General Armstrong and
the British ship The Anne.
"The case of the Ryeshitelni is in
itself of 'trifling importance, but it
involves a principle of paramount im
portance. Experience has shown that
China has taken no adequate steps to
enforce her neutrality laws. If in
these circumstances the Ryeshitelni
could make Chefu a harbor of refuge,
then the great ships of the Russian
navy might do the same and nothing
would prevent those ships from issu
ing forth from their retreat to attack
Japan. The necessity of guarding
against such an eventuality was too
commanding, too overwhelming, to
permit the Ryeshitelni incident to
stand as a precedent. The end of this
incident will not affect in any way for
eign commerce or disturb the general
situation in China, but will merely
serve notice to Russia that she must
keep her engagements in the future."
"It has been suggested in many quar
ters that the present case is compar
able with the case of the Florida,
among others, but the Japanese Gov
ernment draws a clear distinction be
tween the two events. The neutrality
of Brazil was perfect and uncondi
tional and Port Bahia was a long dis
tance from the seat of war, whereas
the neutrality of China is imperfect
and conditional and the port of Chefu
is in close proximity to the zone of
military operations.
' "The statement of the commander
of the Ryeshitelni that h}s ship was
disarmed upon arrival at .Chef u is un
true. The vessel was fully armed and
manned when tisited by Lieutenant
Termshima early on the morning of
August 13; but, in any event, disarm
ament would not fulfill the require
ments of China's neutrality regula
tions, and It was for China, not Rus
sia, to decide.

Pioneer Hall in San Francisco will be
the headquarters of Sacramento Com
mandery No. 2, under the direction oi
the eminent commander, Edward A.
Weil. Everything has been arranged
for the comfort of the members of Sac
ramento Commandery No. 2, as well as
the outside Sir Knights. A large, airy
reception-room; reading-room, smok
ing-room, lunchroom and concert hall
have been provided, filled with divans
and easy chairs, and open hospitality
will be the order of the day. Medical
attendance will be at the service of the
Knights, a room having been equipped
as an emergency hospital.
The badges for Sacramento Com
mandery No. 2 are gilt and metal or
molu, with burnished enamel in black
and red. A golden horse mounted by a
Sir Knight forms a metal crossbar,
upon which appears "San Francisco,
1904"; ranging from the bar is a Mal

Commandery No. 2," the whole making
a complete and tasty desfgn.
Sacramento Commandery No. 2 will

ernoon, September 4, and will march in
a body direct to its headquarters at
Pioneer. Hall, headed by its own band
of twenty-one pieces. There will be

SACRAMENTO'S QUARTERS.
suggestive of the country's chief pro
duct. The globe rests upon battlements
.made of the rarest specimens of.gold
bearing quartz, and the four towers at
the corners are guarded by mounted
Knights of silver. The entrance gates
are of pure massive gold, signifying
the Golden Gate. The trophy is quite
large and massive, and perhaps the
finest specimen of the goldsmith's art
ever produced. It will elicit admira
tion everywhere.
The Californlans have appropriated a
princely fortune for trophies, in order
to make it worth the while of the best
drill corps In the land to compete. The
original sum set aside for the commit
tee on competitive drill was $15,750.
That was intended to provide trophies
for each of the drill corps that had.en
tered the competition at an early date.
Since then it has been decided to add
to the original amount in order that
each competing drill corps shall receive
a valuable prize, and each commandery
whose drill corps competes will be pre
sented with a handsome stand of col
ors, consisting of a silk beausant and
the national colors. The last prize will
be worth not less than $1000.
The prizes are perhaps the most val
uable ever offered at any competitive
drill. They are made of California ma
terialâgold, silver, bronze and the rich
est gold-bearing quartz. They embody
the highest conception of art and are a
credit to California genius and work
manship. They will , be . given without
distinction, the award to be made by a
commission of officers of the United
States army and the drill masters of
the drill corps. One of the trophies is
especially admired by artists and peo
ple accustomed to see the best'- In that
line. It represents a Knight holding
aloft the laurel wreath of victory and
leaning upon "the 'sword of his order in
repose-
He stands upon a silver globe repre
senting the earth, . upon which Califor
nia stands out in golden prominence,
RICH TROPHIES OFFERED.
Around the edge of the Jousting field
will ne gathered thousands. The trum
pet will signal, as it did of old, and
plumed Knights of the Temple will
march into the amphitheater, headed
by a mounted troupe. They will go
through the evolutions prescribed by
the rites of the Order of the Temple,
rites that are almost as old as the
Round Table.
The drill corps that will compete are
the finest in the country. Among them
are: The De Molay Corps of Louisville,
Ky.; the Malta of Birmingham. N. Y.:
the Ivanhoe of Milwaukee and the St.
Bernard of Chicago.
The California commanderies will not
enter their drill corps, as they are
hosts, but there will be a separate con
test for the California Templars at
some other date.
All that was martial and picturesque
about the tournaments held when God
frey de St. Omar and Hugh de Peyens
guarded the "pilgrims' road" and
lodged in the palace of the L.atin Kings
will be brought to earth again when
the crack drill corps of the Knights
Templar go through their evolutions on
September 7. Â«
Of course, there will be no crashing
of lances, no clanging of battle axes
on steel helmets, no horses mangled and
no gallant riders. hacked to death. The
world has grown softer and wiser in
these daj-s. But the love of gaudy
color, pageantry and the blare of
brazen trumpets is undiminished. Per
haps it has increased. This desire will
be fully satisfied by the drill of the
Knights of the Temple.
Without the bloodshed the amphi
theater at Golden Gate Park will be a
scene from the days of chivalry. The
spirit of knighthood will be there. The
same natural carpet over which
Launcelot, Sir Launfal and others of
the Round Table rode â the green sward,
will be spread along the amphitheater.
Ladies as fair as Guenlvere and
gentle as Elaine, the Lily Maid of Asto
lot, will sit and encourage their favor
ites. Even as it was in the days when
knighthood was in flower will it be on
that day.

NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â The Financier
says: The features of the official state
ment of the New York Associated
Banks last week was new high records
for specie, cash and deposits, a further
expansion in loans bringing the total to
within $674,800 of the maximum on July
23, and an Increase in the surplus re
serve to within $3,400,475 of the highest,
which was on July 2, 1898. The net cash
gain last week was $1,491,100, or less by
$835,200 than that which was estimated
on the basis of the traceable movement
of money. This discrepancy may be
satisfactorily accounted for, it probably
being due to the system of averages.
The deposits increased 52,438,000, which
was less by $1,736,100 than the sum of
the increase in loans and the net gain
in cash. Therefore the statement does
not balance. The reserve requirements
were augmented $609,500 as the result
of the increase in deposits, deducting
which sum from the net gain in cash
left $881,600 as the increase in the sur
plus reserve to $58,613,075, the highest,
as stated, since July 2, 1898, when it
was $62,013,550.
Computed on the basis of deposits,
less those of $23,378,900 public funds,
the . surplus is $64,457,800. The loans
were expanded by $2,693,000, probably
reflecting syndicate borrowing and also
loans of the proceeds of sterling and
finance bills. The daily average of bank
clearings last week was $186,000,000, or
$21,000,000 more than in the previous
week, . reflecting the increased specula
tion on the Stock Exchange.

Talking of the power of money as
yielded by the Standard Oil Company,
the erstwhile copper magnate Bays: "At
no time in the history of the United
States has the power of dollars been
so great. Freedom and equity are con
troll-'l by dollars. The laws which
should preserve ar.d enforce all rights
are made and enforced by dollars. It Is
possible to-day with dollars to steer*
the selections of candidates of both the
parties for the highest office in
our republic, that of President of the
United States, so that the people as
a matter of fact must elect one of the
"steered' candidates."
The most startling: part of Lawson's
nai-rative is that in which he describes
vrhai he calls "audacious deception
l>rati iced upon him l>y Mr. Rogers."
Alter explaining that' he, H. H.
Hugeis ar.d William Rockefeller had
prone into an Amalgamated Copper deal
on \hc: basis cf equal partners, Lawson
describes how his two partners kept all
the information from him and how he
compelled them to pay double the
amount due him according to their own
accounts.
Mr. Lawron adds: "Thirty-six mil
lion dollars for one honest day's labor.
Thirty-six million dollars, and Alaska
cost us but fourteen millions and Spain
relinquished her claims on the Philip
pices for only twenty millions. Thirty
six million dollars, more than a hun
dred times as much as George Wash
ington, Thomas Jefferson and 'Abe'
Lincoln together secured for the pa
triotic labors of their lifetimes."
In beginning the article Mr. Law
son says the Standard Oil Com
pany has tried to have him cease his
attacks on the company by asserting
that it, too, had been "gold
bricked" by Marcus Daly and that it
"was duped as much as any of the thou
sand other victims of Amalgamated
Copper.

OMAHA, Aug. 20.â All but one of

State Normal School Has Largest Class
In Its History and No More
Will Be Received. /
According to the report of the pres
ident of the San Francisco State Nor
mal School, the largest class in its
history has just been admitted and It
is necessary to refuse admittance .for
the. present to any further applicants.
The enrollment of normal students is
now 136. It will probably be possible
to admit a small number at the open-
Ing of the second term In the begin
ning of October. Of the new students
about one-fifth come from San Fran
cisco high schools and the remainder
from the accredited high schools as
far south as Santa Barbara and as
far north as Marysville.-^
In addition to the normal students,
about 300 pupils have been enrolled
in the primary and grammar depart
ments, taking advantage of the smaller
classes and' greater personal attention
which can be given them.
. The report also ; shows that every
graduate of the school available for
teaching has already been secured and
the management is now obliged to re
fuse applications for teachers. Since
the close of the school last May, fifty
three teachers' positions have been fill
ed by graduates of the schools as fol

WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS, Aug. 20.â
California music composition is having
an inning at tne San Francisco build
ing, where an exquisitely toned piano
with an automatic playing attachment
is pouring into the public ear melody
from three folios of the best efforts of
Golden State musicians. The folios were
prepared and sent here:. by Byron
Mauzy. They contain both vocal and
instrumental selections. Among the no
table pieces in the collection are "Ghost
Dance of the Zunl Indians," "Zunl Cra
dle Song" and "Lovers Wooing," trans
lated by Professor Carlos Troyer. The
"Ghost Dance" had already been played
by an exposition band and was well
received. These Indian compilations
have an originality and oddity about
them that bring more than passing at
tention from musical people. The two
songs named have been sung success
fully by Denis O'Sulllvan and David
Bispham. Edgar Stlllman Kelly's El
Dorado suite and his "Macbeth" music,
the ballads of Major Darling and bits
from the operatic efforts of Emil Bru
guiere and Dr. H. J, Stewart are among
the many pleasing compositions in the
collection. . /I !'Â¦â¢â¢â¢ â¢*
The folios are a valuable addition to
the varied exhibit in the San Francisco
building, which now covers a range
from wharf building and hay to Batten
berg and music and song, and gives
the visitor an insight Into both the com
mercial and the art life of the inter
esting metropolis of the West.
SAN FRANCISCO EXHIBIT.
San Francisco has a great advantage
on the -model street, 'for. other cities
show little besides street-cleaning ap
paratus and other municipal " utilities,
which are entertaining to city officials
and contractors, bu^ do not draw nor
hold the public, and are not especially
attractive to women.: The' commercial
exhibit is properly given the most
prominent, place In the San Francisco
structure, but there are other things
strewn around to attract a public that
will not go very far to view a commer
cial exhibit only. , ...
A wealthy and refined class finds its
way to the San Francisco building, and
while there are sqme things aboutthe
structure^and display that are neces
sarily crude because of the adverse
conditions under which the work was
carried on, â¢ these visitors find enough
that is pleasing to cause them to : call
again and to send their friends around.
Monterey County has sent to the
California display in the Educational

the delight of the children and an ob

than they are on the coasts, where their
commonness makes them objects of lit

The public library idea is spreading
to the ends of the world! It was no or
dinary occasion when" on April 5 a con
ference if librarians and those interest
ed in the libraries of South Africa was
held at Johannesburg. A large number
of 'delegates were present from the li
braries of Cape Colony, Natal, Trans
vaal, Rhodesia and the Orange River
Colony. The proceedings of the confer
ence show that in- Cape Colony .there
are now 100 public libraries, the largest,
at Cape Town, having over 100,000 vol
umes. Natal, Durban and Pietermarltz
burg each have libraries of 14,000 books,
besides reporting many smaller ones.
The support of the libraries conies
chiefly from subscriptions, yet- it is a
noteworthy fact that almost every mu
nicipality makes liberal yearly appro
priations. ' Â¦
Another proof of universal Interest
felt In general education through libra
ries is afforded by the establishment of
a public library in the native settlement
at Papawal, sixty miles from Welling
ton,. N. Z. This movement was started
entirely by the Maoris to carry out the
plan of a deceased j chief for the im
provement of the district. A large room
in the village assembly hall-has been
assigned to the library, the Government
has been asked for a grant of money
and it Is said that Andrew 'Carnegie
will be appealed to for a building.
The Carnegie gifts reported for the
month of June were six in .number and
amounted to $70,000. Moscow, Idaho,
was one of the six,- receiving the offer
of $10,000. â¢ * â¢
To Canadian cities Mr. Carnegie has
thus far. given funds for thirty-five li
brary buildings, to cost in the aggre
gate $1,330,000. * The largest donation
was made to Toronto, $350,000.
Grand Haven, Mich., received a be
quest of $10,000 by the will of. the late
Webster Batcheller of San Francisco
to aid in the erection of a public library
building. ....
The Maiden, Mass., public library has
the good : fortune to be the beneficiary
under the will of Elisha D. Converse
for the sum of $150,000.
Mount Holyoke College, South Had
ley, Mass., the pioneer college for wom
en in New England, was able on com
mencement day, June 22, to announce
that $50,000 had been pledged \ for the
new library- This assures the condi
tional offer of Mr. Carnegie for $50,000
toward a' $100,000 library building.

a prosperous year. It has been dis

of fiction and corres'pondlng Increase
in the use of juvenile and other books
and by the Instant success attending

SACRAMENTO THRIVING, "j '
A survey of the work .of the Sacra

crease of patronage during the last
twelve months. Additional space for
book, stacks and for the public ac

is proposed to utilize that portion of
the lot which is in the rear of the ex

children's and a reference "room. The
receipts from the annual - tax have
been $11,399 and the expenditures
$10,921.

under wet blankets. No set of men
could have fought more effectively
with the appliances at hand. The

rendered valuable assistance, as did
also the firemen of Concord and Port

is no possible doubt upon
one subject andxupon it the commit
tee will make some strong recommen
dations. That is that first offenders
should be separated from recidivists.
That Is a plain and simple duty that
none can gainsay. The youthful of
fender who has been guilty of but one
act of crime should not be permitted
to communicate In any way whatever
while in jail or prison with an old
offender. This i3 the one central prin
ciple Xrom which we can -work out to-
the Legislature at thc beginning of the
session and by a careful discussion of it
we h'bpe. to accomplish what other
Legislatures have found- it impossible
to accomplish because of lack of time.
"The keynote of real prison reform
is to be found In the word 'segrega
tion,* for by separating the prisoners
it will be possible . to remove the
means of nracticlng the disgraceful
vices which' have made California
prisons notorious. Both San Quentln
and Folsom should be converted Into
prisons of separate jcells. Segregation
is . advocated by ill authorities and
rÂ»6st strongly by, the prison authori
ties themselves. The cost would be
tremendous, perhaps, but prisons are
not built for a day or a w.eek,.but for
decades. ' â¢ \
â¢ihar that of parading to the world a
* c-ondition of alfa!rs which has rightly
'been lcrmcd a disgrace to civilization.

ous matter without any results other
'difected. to secure reports from all
prison authorities in the United States
and Europe, tugethcr with such special
â¢ publications as were of recognize<l

â¢ visited San yuentin and Folsom and
.the State Reform schools and at a
.meeting to bo tailed this month the
" -material at hand t\ ill be carefully gone
"over and our recommendations imme
'diately prepared.
"The reason which prompted me to
nia.ke the resolution by authority of
.which this committee was appointed
Â«as that I saw that the regular Com
mittees on Prison both in the Senate
and the Assembly came in so late in
Ihe Session that no definite scheme of
prison reform could be adopted. The
disclosures made by the committees
. during the last session emphasized the
/act that radical changes in prison
mfthnds are needed, but at the time we
could do nothing. Th^re was not suf
ficient time: othor Important legislation
demanded attention and the question is
manifestly too big a one to be hur
â¢ ripdly considered. It seemed that a
.Vommfttee bringing in a definite plan
â¢at t!ie . beginning of tho session, one
carefully framed under the advice and
"approval of the Governor, the Board
of Prison TMrectors. the State Board
of <"hyritÂ«es and Corrections and

cure some teal reform. rather

LOS ANGELES, Aug. :.Uâ One of the j

the Legislature will be that of prisons
ar.d prison reforms, and more atten

received ct the hands of any previous

Radical chitges will probably be ad-
Aised in tie manner in which the af

of the State are administered and an
effort will be made to secure for Cali
fornia, prisons a system of government
which chali embrace all the best fea
tures of the model prisons of this
country and Europe.
There will be no need of sending the J
standing: committees of both houses to j
the various institutions except, to in

repetition of the disclosures made dur- I
Ing the session of the last Legislature j
in the official reports. By the time the |
Legislature assembles there will be j
available for- its members a mass of in- j
formation, statistical and otherwise, j
such as no committee could compile j

VALUABLE GOWNS RUINED
Damage Done by Rainstorm at St.
â Louis Exposition.
ST. LOUIS, Auff. 20.â Magnificent
Parisian gowns, valued at $500,000, are
In a ruined condition in the Palace of
Manufactures as the result of the
heavy rainstorm which swept over the
World's fair. The "gowns were exhib
ited, by French dressmakers and were
one of the most interesting features of
the Manufactures building. They were
displayed in glass showcases, but the
rain was driven through crevices in
the roof of the building and poured
down Upon the top of the cases, event
ually leaking through and soaking the
garments.
Many of the dresses had been sold,
to be delivered to St. Louis and Chi
cago firms at the close of the World's
Fair. The damage, it fa said, cancels
the contracts.
JOKE CAUSES ARREST
OF GOTHAM BROKERS
Detectives Catch Them Gambling for
Pennies With a Toy Roulette
Wheel.
NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â A joke that
miscarried has caused a police raid on
a brokerage office in a big building on
Lower Broadway and the arrest of five
men, who were locked up on charges of
gambling. Two of the prisoners are
.members of the Consolidated Stock and
Petroleum Exchange. '
After the day's business had been fin
ished some one in the brokerage office
produced a pocket roulette wheel such
as are p sold in toy shops, and those
present, anxious for amusement, sent
out for a lpt of pennies. Then all sat
down to a big table and were having a
lot of fun when the door suddenly flew
open and a squad of detectives entered.
The brokers explained that they were
only amusing themselves, but* admitted
that they were. gambling. The pennies
and wheel , were confiscated and the
players marched off to the station.
It appears that some outsider 1m a
spirit of fun had called up police hild
quarters and reported a gambling
house in' full operation in the office.
The number of cotton r splndle3 in
use in the United States increased last
year from 15.500,000 to 20,000,000,
owing principally to new factories in
the cotton belt.
Speculation lured William J. Smith,
receiving teller of the San Francisco
Savings Union, from the paths of duty
and lost him his position. Though he
made good every cent he used. Smith's
employers decided to let him go.
William J. Smith was prosperous,
and well liked by a large circle of
friends. He was keeper of wampum
for the Improved Order of Red Men
and chancellor of the exchequer for one
of the lodges of the Knights of Py
thias. In all more than $15,000 was in
trusted to his care.
When one of the bubbles of specula
tion in which he based his hopes burst.
Smith used this trust money, hoping
to regain what he had lost. But it was
good money thrown after the bad, and,
more than that, money not his own.
The "salt trust," the scheme which he
hoped would make him rich, fell flat.
The moneys he used were: $7000 Be
longing to Manzanlta Tribe; $8000.
the per capita tax of the Great Council
of the Red Men, and $500 belonging to
the Knights of Pythias.
These sums he made good. For the
$7000 he gave property at Point Rich
mond, worth more than that sum. For
the $8000 he gave securities worth
double the amount. The $500 he paid
In cash.
His brethren in the fraternal orders
forgave him Immediately, but hia em
ployers felt that a man given to spec
ulation should not be a receiving teller.
"Smith lives at 922 Ellis street.
James Boyes, Smith's successor as
keeper of wampum in the Red yen,
said last night:
"William J. Smith is as honest as
I the day. It was simply a case of mis
placed confidence. If he wanted $5000
to-day I would let him have it. I do
not think that he will lose his position
in the bank. All that know him like
and trust him. He restored more than
I twice the amount he used."
SWEPT BY FIERCE GALE.
Great Damage Done to Property at
Kockaway Beach.'
NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â Rockaway
Beach was swept by a fierce storm to-
day and much damage was done, but
so far as is known no lives were lost.
A tornado swept over Rockaway Park,
blowing down trees, fences and chim
neys and leaving a wreck strewn path
200 feet wide. The wind caught the roof
of the pavilion attached to the Adiron
dack Hotel and the building, was de
molished, but nobody was injured. Por
tions of the wreck were caught up by
the wind and carried a hundred feet
away.
The tornado passed out into Jamaica
Bay, where the wind formed a small
waterspout that grew In proportions as
it passed up the bay, overturning many
of the small , boats anchored in the
channel.
It spent its force against. the railroad
trestle. The tide in Jamaica Bay rose
to an unprecedented height. Thou
sands of tons of sand were cut away
from the beach by the strong cur
rents.

Member of Call Staff Tells of His Ex
perience on Trestle.
* E. A. Rogers, an artist, connected
with The Call, was en the 3:15 train,
bound for Santa Cruz. He returned to
Kan Francisco about 11 o'clock last
evening. He states that his train pass
jed the first section of the St. Agnes
picnic train at Alma when his train
was slowly climbing a grade. Suddenly
he felt the wheels grinding on the
brakes and thin felt the shock of the
collision.
"We were all thrown forward against
the seats as the train came to a halt,
but suffered no injury," said Rogers.

ability of any call for money from that
quarter. Interior money markets show
the beginning of the fall demand. But
with a surplus of $60,000,000 in the New

is viewed with equanimity. It is ex

to the usual volume and the higher

swell the usual demand. But possible

Another old California pioneer early
yesterday morning passed away when
Dr. Louis W. Bueh, living at 2108 How
ard street, died of heart failure. A
short time before he expired he com
plained of shortness of breath, but
none present thought the end was so
near. The stroke of death must have
been a gentle and a painless one, as
those arotfhd him did not know just
when the change took place.
Dr. Bush could be called the dean of
dentistry on this coast, as he came
here by way of Panama in 1S54. He
opened an office on Kearny street, near
Clay, which was for some time the only
place where the early San Franciscan
could get relief from dental woes. He
remained in that office room for twen
ty-two years, and in all his half-cen
tury of life in this city he moved his
dental office only three times, and never
off Kearny street.
Dr. Bush was born in Hanover, Ger
many, where he learned his proAssion.
He '.anded in Baltimore in 1847, remain
ing there about six years. He leaves a
wife, one daughter, Mrs. A. F. Kuder,
and two sons, Charles G. and Dr. Fer
dinand Bush, the latter of whom was
associated in the business with his
father. The deceased was a member of
Concordia Â¦ Lodge of Odd Fellows, by
whom he will be. burled from* the resi
dence of the family at 2108 Howard
street, Monday afternoon. It was the
doctor's often expressed wish that his
body be cremated after death, and in
this manner the remains will be dis
posed of in Odd Fellows' Cemetery.

"Soon after leaving the trestle and
getting on the ground I came to the
two locomotives standing still and
wrecked," contfnued Rogers. "They
were jammed close against each other,
and the front of each was shattered.
The narrow-gauge engine being the
lighter was badly damaged.
"The tender and a baggage car of
our train had been telescoped. The pas
sengers on the picnic train, badly
scared, were rushing out of the cars.
I sa.w a number who were injured, but
none fatally. There were several phy
sicians among the passengers and they
attended to the injured.
"Our engine was No. 10. The picnic
train was pulled by No. 1376. We were
going slowly and so, I understand, was
the other train, otherwise there would
have been great destruction of life."

WHO PASSED AW AT SUDDENLY
FROM HEART FAILURE.
Special Dispatch to TfcÂ« Call.
.NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â Just exactly
how Governor Odell acquired hia
J200.000 worth of bonds of the defunct
United States Shipbuilding Company
â¢was told to-day. The statement is
made without qualification that his suit
for the. recovery of the money thus In
vested will not be settled, as was the
euit brought by Kavanaugh.
According to the statements made to
â¢â¢day by one of the principal defendants
in the Governor's suit, the Governor on
three separate occasions told the nten
' who were promoting the deal that he
wanted to come in. He was told that
these men did not guarantee the 8uc
\ cess of the project, but he said he knew
c "all about the scheme and was satisfied
that It was a good one. He telephoned
one Saturday morning in the spring
cf 1902 to J. T. Boothroyd, Charles B.
Alexander's secretary, that he wanted
to get hold of some of the shipyard
bondf ; he reiterated this statement at
the home of Boothroyd in Newburg late
that day and again the following Mon
day, by long distance telephone at
noon,' when he was in Albany.
The Governor stated to Colonel Mc-
Cook and to Boothroyd. they declared,
that he wanted to get about $200,000
, -worth cf 5 per cent thirty-year first
mortgage bonds of ftte United States
Bhiribuilding Company. He was told
the American underwriting of $3,000,000
was already completed, but he insisted,
.It is asserted, and then Boothroyd' went
to Lewis Nixon and asked him if he
.wxmld relinquish some ot his holdings
for the Governor, and John W. Young
was similarly asked if he would part
with seme of his bonds. Both agreed
to do so.
The prospectus of April 19, 1902, the
original scheme for Invoking subscrip
tions and the underwriting agreement,
together with $200,000 worth of the
"bones, were delivered to Governor Odell
at Xewburg. It is understood that he
"farmed out" practically his entire
holdings and one of his closest friends
â¢in Xewburg is said to have had to
mortgage his house to pay for his pro
portion of the subscriptions as they
Â¦wero called for under the terms of the
underwriting agreement.
-WRECK 01- SANTA. CRUZ ROJO
NEW YORK, Aug. 20.â Yesterday's
profit taking was in continued evidence
in to-day's stock market. Resistance
was offered to "the decline until the
fears of the renewed wheat market
weakened the grangers and turned
prices In general downward in sympa
thy, v
United Spates Steel preferred was de
terminedly supported in the early deal
ings, In spite of the further reports of
unsettled conditions in the traders.
Traders were suspicious of a specula
tive origin of some of the damaging
reports in the steel trade developments,
and profess to detect a very large un
covered Interest in United States Steel
preferred. These factors have a deter
rent effect on plans to attack the stock
by short sales. Pennsylvania also was
conspicuously firm, and the anthracite
coal carriers showed good resistance
under the favorable influence of a re
ported agreement on a plan for the
settlement of differences between min
ers and operators in that trade. A vio
lent break in Metropolitan Securities,
which carried Metropolitan Street Rail
way down with It, gave added force to
the reaction, and the late weakening
of the grangers caused the whole list to
give way. The leading grain-carriers
all lost in the neighborhood of a point.
A fractional rally was interrupted by a
further drop in Metropolitan Securities,
and the closing was irregular.
The bank statement furnished no sur
prises. The moderate expansion made
up an important part of the increased
receipts, but there was a sufficient cash
increase to more than keep pace with
the additional requirement, thus add
ing $882,775 to the already abundant
surplus.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $1,
225,000.
RELICTION RESISTED.
The stock market this week has been
Irregular, and at times quite weak, but
reactions have been resisted and over
come, although the general course of
prices has been upward. This was in
face of some heavy selling to take
profits and against the sentiment of a
large part of the professional operators,
who have looked constantly for a nat
ural reaction in view of the duration
and extent of the rise, which went be
fore. Some of the week's news has of
fered a rather formidable prospect to
holders of securities, but this was also
ignored, and offerings of stocks were
steadily absorbed up to the higher level
attained by prices.
The crop news of the week has been
distinctively unfavorable to stocks, al
though the opinion of the outlook in
the financial- district has not gone the
length of the, disastrous conditions re
ported in the grain markets and effec
tive in the excited speculation there.
The material reduction in the wheat
crop which has resulted in the dam
age from rust, however, is generally
admitted and the extent to which this
may go is recognized to be a factor for
future determination. Even more im
portance is attached to the. corn crop
for it3 promise of an effective offset to
the unpromising qutlook for wheat.
P'oreign shortages of wheat are looked
to to stimulate a large demand for corn,
so that a bis crop of that cereal will
play an important part in the year's
prosperity of the country. The week's
misgivings over the progress of that
crop was therefore a serious factor in
the stock market. Reports of deteriora
tion from lack of moisture were re
ceived with much anxiety and the dan
ger still to come of harm from frost to
corn was a restraining Influence on
speculation. The gravity of the. situa
tion in the steel trade is also freely
conceded. Price cuts already author
ized in that trade have offered a basis
for industrious calculation as to the
direct effect on the earnings of the
United States Steel Corporation. Be
yond that direct result is the effect to
be expected in including a waiting at
titude on the part ot thff 'consumers,
whose indisposition to make commit
ments on a falling market or with a
chance for lower prices will naturally
follow.
AVILLi CONTEST MARKET..
The purpose of the United States
Steel Corporation to prevent a profit to
the Pennsylvania Company from its
acquisition of steel billets at a reduc
tion of $1 a ton from the association
price is clearly indicated and the pur
pose of that company to contest the
market for wire products is avowed.
Meantime the existence of pools ami
agreements for maintaining prices of
other finished steel products is felt to
be menaced, with the possible* exception
of steel rails. While this condition has
not been without some effect, although
a moderate one, in the United States
Steel stocks and those of some of the
Independent steel companies, the sym
pathetic effect on the general market
has been surprisingly small. Trouble in
the New York trades was extended
and the meat packers'- strike was still
a subject of daily attention and discus
sion.
That prices of stocks should contirtue
to make headway against a combina
tion of disturbing influences in this
way has been a cause of surprise and
of some suspicion of manipulation by
parties of professional operators. Ma
nipulation evidence in some cases has
been rather flagrant, in fact," but the
"success of this manipulation was in it
self proof of a strong underlying condi
tion in the market which Â¦ made the
bears ' among the professionals very
timid about attacking the market.
That the supply of stocks for sale was
very small is a very palpable fact- j | No
liquidation of importance has been in
duced at any stage, aside from some
speculative profit-taking, which was
readily absorbed. Vt.'vV* ~~
MONEY MARKET EASY.
The condition of the money market
offers a strong attraction for the hold
ing of stocks. The call loan rate has
ranged from 1 per cent to % per cent
and there is practically no demand for

the Chinese Minister, "regarding the
queue. Stories have circulated for
years that the loss of his queue meant
ostracism to a Chinese in his own coun
try and eternal perdition hereafter.
That is not tnle. There is nothing In
the religious or moral requirements of
the Government affecting the habit of
queue wearing. It is entirely a matter
of individual custom and preference.
The Chinese wear queues because of
continuous habit. Many Chinese, even
in China, have cut off their queues
without exciting remark.
"In Mexico the Chinese, as a rule,
are discarding their Oriental habits and

Luigl Ferrari yesterday applied to
the Superior Court for an Injunction
to prevent the levying of an execution
against him from the Justices' Court
on a judgment for $79 given In favor
of D. A. Curtin, who sued him on an
assigned claim. Ferrari declares that
the suit was brought February 17,
1903, by Curtin, but no copy of the
complaint or summons was served.
He alleges, however, that Curtin pro
cured a false affidavit of one Abram
Shear to the effect that he had served
Ferrari with the summons and on the
strength of the affidavit Justice Law
son gave judgment on default. Fer

Herbert T. Thornburgh, who ap
pears in the directory as a physician
for the Globe Medical Company, was
yesterday made defendant in a suit
for divorce begun by his wife, Emma
Thornbnrgh, who charges him with de
sertion and failure to provide her with
the necessaries of life. According to
her complaint they were married at
San Jose April 21, 1902, and he de
serted her at Tuolumne July 15, 1903.
Lillian M. Clark, without an attor
ney, appeared In the County Clerk's of

Harry A. Clark ordered on February

the long period elapsing between the
dismissal and the entry. When Mrs.
Clark brought her suit she charged
her husband with extreme cruelty,
which included an assault which ren
dered her unconscious for three hours.
In the complaint she asked the court
to award her $75 a month alimony.
The case never came to trial.

The trial of the suit in replevin of
F. W. Foresting against Chief of Po
lice Wlttman and Propety Clek W.
E. Dinan for the recovery of certain
jewelry taken from Mrs. Annie Lippe,
who was recently arrested and has
since died In an asylum, was begun
before Justice of the Peace Daniels
yesterday.
John Greely, attorney for the de
fendants, and Charles Peery, attorney
foi the plaintiff, agreed to file a stipu
lation substituting Public Administra
tor Hynes as defendant in the case
on the understanding that the jew
elry would be .turned over to him.
Judge Daniels refused to consent to
this proceeding, holding that in the
event of the popety being tuned
over to the Public Administrator it
would necessitate the bringing of a
new suit, as the jewely was not In
his possession when the original suit
was first instituted. It was then
agreed to put the case over until next
Thursday, when the stipulation agreed
upon will be perfected and the matter
settled in probate. Richard Mogan also
appeared In court, saying he repre
sented the mother of Mrs. Lippe, who
claimed the property.
The Jewelry, which Foresting claims
to be his own property, consists of one
pair of diamond earrings, two tur
quoise rings, one diamond ring, one
sapphire ring, one pearl ring, one dia
mond locket, one plain gold ring and
$50 in cash, which Mrs. Lippe had on
her person at the time of her arrest.

preliminary hearing on August 30.
Fales conducted a grain speculation
business here under the firm name of
Arthur E. Whitcock & Co., in which
he acted as the agent for persons who
wanted to trade in speculative grain
markets in response to circulars sent
out by him.
The papers in his office seized by
Marshal Durham include a number of
accounts and records that undoubtedly
belonged to the Rialto Grain Company
of St. Louis, with which Senator James
R. Burton of Kansas was at one time
connected. These records are in the
form of cards, which indicate that the
average amount paid by. the would-be
speculators Is not far from $100. The
cards number 3000 and bear the names
of persons in every part of the United
States and Canada.
The warrant for Fales' arrest was
sworn out by W. A. Piatt, a postoffice
inspector from St. Louis, and Fales
will be taken to that city after his
preliminary hearing.
The cards bear the names of a great
many Canadians, while there are many
persons in Georgia, California and
other States. Several of the cards also
show that the company had invested
sums for persons in the Government
departments in Washington, and even
the New York State penitentiary is
represented.

ALAMOSA, Colo., Aug. 20.â Senator
T. M. Patterson, who, at the request of

for the purpose of converting the sec

complete failure of the project. Tha
Senator says the Indians absolutely re

cause they declare they have been so
badly treated In the past. They In
formed him that In 1896 they had en

Government agreed to bring water on
to their reservation.

party, but she was the only one who
attempted the ascent of Mount Hood.
She went to the summit with another
party of fifteen.
Miss Webb had not expected to make
the trip to the summit, so had little
time to prepare for the journey. In
her hand she carried one cheese sand
wich and that, with pieces of ice which
she picked up on the way, constituted
her rations for the day.
"One^cheese sandwich is a pretty
short ration for a mountain climber,
and if it had not been for the Ice I
am afraid I should have"- been ex
hausted," said she. "When we ar
rived back at the snow line, my father
was there with a pot of coffee, and if
you ever want to know how good coffee
tastes just climb to the summit of
Mount Hood with one sandwich and
I think your desire will be gratified.
"I slept in a hammock all the time
we were gone and I slept in blankets
at the snow line one night.' I rode an
Indian pony to the snow line. We
started about 5 o'clock in the morning
and reached the summit about 1
o'clock. We started back at 1:30 and
arrived down at 5 o'clock."

All England Is discussing the dispar
ity between the suffering Inflicted by
the law on a man guiltless of any
wrong and the compensation offered
when the mistake was discovered.
The conviction was not merely an ex
traordinary case of mistaken identity,
but Beck was the victim of a conspir
acy to procure the conviction of a pris
oner by suppressing facts which would
have insured his triumphant acquittal.
The fact Is clear that BeclÂ£ was orig
inally convicted of stealing rings from
unfortunate women, largely because it
was believed that he was a certain
John Smith, who had been convicted in
1877 of the same offense under exactly
similar circumstances. Yet while his
identity with John Smith played a pre
ponderant part In the evidence against
him it was ruled out of court and the
prisoner was not allowed to prove or
establish an alibi.
Medical evidence -was also forthcom
ing to show that Â¦while John Smith waa
a Hebrew, Beck was not, but all that
the Government did in the light of this
fact waa to remove from Beck's prison
garb the lettering which etated "pre
vious conviction."
LONDON, Aug. 20.â That the much

at Scotland Yard can send an Innocent
man to penal servitude for a long term
of years is a fact that has been rudely
brought home to the British people In
the case of Adolf Beck.
As compensation for the gross mis
carriage of Justice in the conviction of
the unfortunate Swede, first In 1S80 and
again In 1896, the Treasury has granted
him the sum of 510,000.

A crowd of men and women strike
sympathizers had gathered at Fortieth

ons, while the remaining force beat
back the great crowd that had gath
ered.
The shot that killed Xebroutskl waa
flred from the third coach, near the
center of the car, and this car the lieu
tenant and his men entered first. As

th'e occupants in a panic and nearly
every man had some kind of a weapon
concealed about him.

All the Cracli Wheelmen of Bay Coun
ties Will Compete To-Day at
Insics-idc.
The wheelmen are looking forward
to a great contest in the ten-mile team
relay race this afternoon at Inglesld?
racetrack. Six teams, composed of
the bay counties' best riders, will
make the runniny. each man carrying
the colors two miles. It is anybody's
race, with chances apparently favor-
Ing the Oakland Wheelmen, but with
several others decidedly in the hunt.
This event Is but one of a dozen care
fully arranged races of a mixed
nature. Footracing has a prominent
place on the programme. Four handi
caps for the sulked shoe experts will
divide attention with a match race at
100 yards between Dave Sullivan and
Phil Wand, well-known sportsmen
and former cinder ?ath champions,
and a half-mile relay between seven
teams from the Public School League.
With an idea to getting the best pos
sible racing. Chairman M. Newmark of
the auxiliary committee of the Cali
fornia Associated Cyclists made uj>
the cycling programme. He has in
cluded two handicap motor cycle races
In his list, and with well adjusted
handicaps there Is na more exciting
sport. A tandem event at three miles
is sure to be a fine contest, as there
is plenty of rivalry and a great dif
ference of opinion concerning the out
come. The novices have been remem
bered with a mile race and more than
forty have hopes of graduating from
the maiden class. A two-mile open
handicap and a mile dash, which is
limited to two entries from each club,
complete* the card.
Both the number and class of the
contestants Insure good sport and an
afternoon at Ingleslde will not be re
jsretted. The affair is a benefit for
TEN-MILE RELAY RACE
ATTRACTS MUCH ATTENTION
Between the time of the argument
and the rendering of the dsclaion by
the Supreme Court the child was kid
naped from the Protestant Orphans'
Home on Haight street by\ Mrs. Kate,
Thompson of 228 Nevada; avenue.
White recovered the girl and placed
her In another home, where she now
is. Then Mrs. Thompson applied for
letters of adoption of the child, which
White resisted on the technicality that
his permission as guardian would have
to be obtained before the girl could be
legally adopted. No evidence was of
ferâ¬?d in court and the Judge ruled In
White's favor on the question' of law.
If Mrs. Thompson wants to continue
her tight she will have to take If to
the Supreme Court. '
With toe facts in the ois-Â» yet to be
heard, Judge Kerrigan yesterday de
cided, upon a question of law, that
Secretary White of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children Is
entitled to the custody of slx-yÂ»!ar-old
Violet Lundberg. It is the sixth court
proceeding in little more than a year
for possession of the girl.
White was appointed as her guar
dian by Judge Coffey in May, 1903,
nnd placed her in an Institution. In
October the mother petlUonad for a
revocation of the letters, i.mt the case
was dismissed by Jud^'e Coffoy upon
request of her attorney. ThÂ« mother
got another attorney an.l began ha
beas corpus proceeding'*, which ehe
lost He then enlarged his motion
and took the case to the Supreme
Court, where YtThlte was again vic
torious.

SARATOGA. N. Y.. Aug. 20.â John
\V. Gates, accompanied by A. B. Hud
son, sauntered into the United States
Club, which 13 run -by Croker & I\en
nedy, last night. The party made up
a pool of $10,000 to be used in
"breaking the bank." Gates called
for two stacks of checks. He was
given two worth $250 each. He
shoved them back and asked for two
worth $5000 each. The house, at
Gates* request, doubled the limit,
which is ordinarily $250 to "cases"
and S500 to "tops."
Gates lost $10,000 and then said he
would go further on his own account
if the limit was taken on! entirely.
Croker agreed, after Joe Ullman and
Maxey Blumenthal had agreed to take
half of the play. Gates played several
hours and at one time his losses were
$35,000. He finally quit about $15,000
loser, the original $10,000 being in
cluded in this amount.

the Golden Gate Park amphitheater
fund and practically every dollar
taken In at the sate will jjo to swell
the amount in Treasurer O'Kane's
possession for that great public im
provement. Donations of prizes,
printing and other incidental ex
penses have reduced the cost of run
ning the show to a minimum.
Mission-street cars will run direct
to the gates for. this day only In addi
tion to the regular Guerrero-street
service. The Columbia Park/ Boys'

For Cheap Litigation.
The appeal of Edward Sullivan,
tried, convicted and sentenced to
twenty years' imprisonment at San
Quentln, has been denied by the Su
preme Court. Sullivan, together with
Gus Shoemacher, committed' a hold
up in Los Angeles, for which crime tit
received sentence. He applied for a
new trial and the order was denied In
the lower court.
Sullivan's attorneys appealed to the
Supreme Court from the judgment of
the lower court and from the order
denying a new trial. The Supreme
Court, however, affirmed the judgment
and order of the lower court.

CONVICTED 31 AX'S APPEAL
A year ago this month .Paul Ligdu,
a student In the University of Califor
nia, now living on Thirty-third street,
Oakland, was sued by Pauline Hulso
for $50,000 for breach of promise
to marry her. In her complaint the
young lady declared that on July IS
and 24 of last year the student de
clared his desire to make her his wife
and because of his failure to keep hia
word she brought tha suit.
Since then the action ha3 .been
pending on a motion for change of
venue. Lidga filed his answer yes
terday. In which he denied that he
had ever promised to Â¦ marry Miss
Hulse and further denied her charge
that he was engaged to"marry another
"female" at the time, citing as proof
that he is still unmarried.
' Some of Lldga's friends say that he
had ambitions as an author and has
had a book published dealing with
college life.
Paul Wgdn Declares lie Never Agreed
to Marry Pauline Ilulse or
Any One Else.

BREACH OF rPROMISE SUIT
Through a circular Issued yesterday
official notice Avas given of an import
ant change in the. conduct of the North
Shore and California Northwest
ern railways, whereby James Fraz
ler will assume tne position of general
manager.' and W. M. Rank, who has
worked faithfully for the welfare of
the road, will have the desk of assist
ant manager.
Frazier was connected with the
Southern Pacific In this city for many
years and only a few months ago went
Kast to take a more important position
than the one occupied by him in this
city. With the arrival of Frazier in
this city the offices of the North Shore
will be consolidated with those of the
California Northwestern in the Mutual
Life building at California and San
some streets.
W. M. Rank is considered one of the
most valuable men in the employ of the
North Shore road. It was largely
through his efforts that consolidation
was effected with the North Pacific
Coast Railway. During the term of
his employ the road has seen many
changes. The antiquated steam cars
which traveled over the tracks at un
certain times have been displaced by
splendid new electric cars. Many other
improvements for the convenience of
the patrons of the road were made un
der his direction.
No intimation has been given as to
what, if any, further Change3 \\ill be
made in the staff of employes.

"CONSTANCE," By D. S. W. Richter.
The first subject selected cculd with difficulty be recognized by the
halftone ?bove en account of the impossibility of showing the exquisite
coloring of the original by this process.
Copies of this picture, which is to be given away r.e::t Sunday, are dis-
played in prominent places throughout the city. Don't fail to see one.
"Constance" represents a rare and delicate type of beauty. The calm,
pure expression of her face is enlivened by the beautiful flesh tints and
strcrnthened bv the bits of contrasting colors brought out by the arrange-
ment of the apple blossoms in her dark hzir.
This study is a most careful reproduction of Mr. Richter's celebrated
original, and is regarded as one of tht best of this famous artist's paint-
ings."Somehow or another, Hinnissy, it don't
seem jus' right that there shud > be a union
iv church an' saloon. These two gr-reat in
stitutions ar're best kept apart. They kind
iv offset each other like th' Supreem Coort
an' Congress. Dhrink is a nicissry evil,
nicissry to th' clargy. If they iver admit
it's. nicissry to th' consumers they might as
well close up th' churches. Ye'll niver find
Father Kelly openin' a saloon. He hates
me business but he likes me. ' He says
dhrink is an evil but I'm 2 nicissity. If I
moved out a worse man mi.^ht come in me
place."
"Ye ra-aly do think dhrink is a nicissry
evil," said Mr. Hinnessy.
"Well." said Mr. Dooley. "if it's an evil
to a man, it's not nicissry an' if it's nicissry
it's an evil." 9HB3SI

OAKLAND is about to pioneer in the most impor
tant matter that can concern American munici
palities. The bond issue proposed in that city for
long needed and highly beneficial public improvements
is handicapped by some advocates of public ownership
of public utilities who desire to hold the city's credit
intact for the purchase of such utilities. To meet this
and placate all parties Councilman John L. Howard
has introduced into the Council a measure looking to
the securing: of authority from the State to issue bonds
for the purchase of public utilities, and basing the bonds
on the plants so acquired, leaving the credit and general
fund of the city unimpaired, to serve the proper purposes
of government and extend the admirable system of pub
lic improvements proposed by the bond issue that is
Mr. Howard's proposition separates the two issues and
keeps them separate. It will give Oakland the leader
ship of a policy that has been widely discussed in this
country and in Europe, and which places the public
utility policy of municipalities on an entirely new and
better basis.
It is believed that the purpose sought by Mr. Howard
can be accomplished without amending the constitution
of the State. But even if that have to be done, it is more
than worth while to do it, for the sake of the relief that
it will be to the credit and general fund of our cities which
may be inclined to experiment with public ownership.
It is in our opinion the only method by which a just and
intelligent business policy in administering public owned
utilities can be secured, and the advocates of public own
ership who without prejudice treat the subject from the
standpoint of well-matured judgment will surely see
their way to support this safe and enlightened policy by
which the users of the public plant will pay for it, and
the public credit will remain intact, no matter what may
happen to the public plant. .
Surely Oakland is awakened and feels the impulse of
leadership, and from this awakening great things may
be expected from that city.
In certain respects boundary mark
ers have a harder task than any other
class of workers who push out
through the unbroken wilderness. Tha
civil engineer who lays out a railroad
line is on the lookout for the easiest
possible course. The route which
would have the fewest difficulties for
him to travel over would have the
fewest obstacles for the railroad.
When he comes Into sight of a region
which is Impassable, by all human
standards, he steps one side and looks
for the next best stretch of country.
With the boundary marker this is dif
ferent. He has to follow the march
ing orders of the treaty which ha la
to execute, and no matter where the
line which it describes In degrees,
minutes and seconds of earth's meas
urement lies, he is expected to fol
low. This makes his task onÂ© of
the most serious . that adventurous
man has to perform. He has to carry
boats, prairie wagons, mountain
climbing mules and a great variety of
appliances for swinging chasms, scal
ing ledges and crossing streams. Hia
party must also keep communication
open with a base of supplies, almost
aa much as an army. The tales of ad
venture of this Alaskan party will be
worth hearing 1 . ...
which no determination -was made
by the Alaskan tribunal. It passes
through a piece of mountain country
of no seemins value, even remotely,
to either nation. Until something
arises to make t*he land worth, some
thing, which is rather Improbable, no
attempt will be made to apply to It
the principles agreed upon at the tri
bunal.

Fanner Actress' Sad Plight.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
E HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. Aug. 7. â Sad,
indeed, is the Etory of an American
woman now in sore straits in London.
A few years ago she was living in
luxury on Massachusetts avenue In
Boston as the wife of John P. Cush
ing, grandson of the old merchant
prince of that name, who made a big
fortune in trade with China. .To-day
she is destitute, friendless and well
r.igh distracted, after a prolonged
search for employment in almost any
capacity.
The unhappy woman's story, backed
by all the necessary legal documents,
is to the effect that her maiden name
was Laura Wolfe. At the age of 17,
when she was living in Brooklyn with
her mother and young sister Louise,
she was, married to Nat Ward, pro
prietor of a Brooklyn billiard hall.
She left him on the ground of cruelty
and obtained a divorce from him in
1891. going on the stage and winning
a considerable reputation in Ingenue
parts. She was with the Donnelly and
Girard Company in "Natural Gas"
when she was wooed and won by
Cushing, 'to whom she was married
in 1894. The pair spent five years of
unalloyed happiness in cruising about
the world in their yacht, the Corona,
with all the luxury that wealth could
'command: but in 1899 love's dream
was rudely interrupted by Cushlng's
with his wife's younger
sister Louise, whom she had cared for
and educated, so she says. According
to Mrs. Cushing* s story t her husband
also wheedled away from her $10,000
Â¦which he had settled upon her.
The injured lady's suit for separa
tion and alimony was met by an
assertion that her first husband had
never been served with the paper in
her- suit against him for divorce, that
the divorce was not technically good,
nnd that the second marriage was null
and void. In the meantime, the first
husband, Ward, supposing that he had
been duly divorced, had married
again. The case was finally decided
against Mrs. Cushing in 1900, after
a long, hard contest in the courts,
and in consequence of the shock she
was ill for the ensuing year from ner
\ous prostration. What little money
she had was soon spent and she was
forced to return to the stage, where
most of her engagements were more
or less unsuccessful. Her last ap
pearance was with the Milton Royles
in "My Wife's Husband." In the cir
cumstances, she observes, the name of
that play got on her nerves. Last
April, as a desperate resort, she came
over to Europe In some vague hope
that she might obtain relief from her
quondam husband, who has lately
been living with his mother, Mrs. John
G. Cushing, on their estate In Pau,
France. Her appeals to him were un
answered, however and disappoint
ment again broke down her health.
To-day her state is pitiable.
A young man, versatile enough to include highway
robbery among his accomplishments, wept bitterly in
court the other day when he was sentenced to pursue
his career for a reasonably long time as a convict in
San Quentin penitentiary. '.If the tears were inspired by
reflection they were justified, even if tardy. If they were
provoked by chagrin they should be held as the sign
of one of the few triumphs won by an unoffending
public over the most dastardly and cowardly of thieves.
The A rizona Editor.
"You fellers on the big city papers,"
said Judge Bradshaw yesterday, as he
carefully parted his long coat-tails and
plumped into an easy chair at the Pal
ace, "has mighty little idea of the com
plex trials of a Arizona editor. One
day I meets up with Hon. Tim Dacy,
who is editor of the Casa Grande
Ruinator.
" 'Hello,* says I, 'how air you?' "
" 'I'm tired, 1 says Tim. 'I've had a
hard week. This editorial labor is
weann' on me. F*r instance, on Mon
day I sows a ten-acre patch to barley,
acts as Judge for the horse races at
the Territorial Fair and referees the
prizefight between Maguire's bartender
and that miner man from Bisbee.
Tuesday I interviews a visiting Bishop
on 'The Ideal Rum Shop.' deals faro
bank for Shorty Harris, who gets shot
In the lee by a Mexican, and reports a
banquet at Rosen's beer hall. Wednes
day I takes my Sunday school class
out for a picnic and relieves Dr. Law
ton that night of $280 by a little skill
ful poker playln'. Thursday I was
pallbearer at Hank Burrows' funeral,
who got drunk and fell In his own
shaft; then I writes a pome on him en
titled 'Oh, For the "Wings of a Angel.'
At night I lectured before the Sorosia
Club on 'Home Influence Among Mex
ican Section Hands.' Friday I shod
my team of mules, worked out my road
tax and delivered a oration before the
Young Men's Henry w. Davis Demo
cratic Club. To-day I built a barn for
my cow, traded a old saddle for a
pretty fair Winchester, repaired the
front of my real estate office and I
ain't half done yet.
" "The worst of It Is. my editorial,
reportorial, composing room and press
room forces is down at Dolan's winning
money at faro bank and lapping up
whisky like a road agent. Chances air
they won't show up for a week. Ye
betchew I'm tired.' "
THE French Academy has recently published a
book, in its "Annales Politiques et Litteraires," on
the industrial resources of the United States, and
the relation of this country to the commercial interests
cf France. This book is reviewed by M. Hanotaux of
the Academy in the Journal de St. Petersburg, an in
iluential Russian paper. M. Hanotaux says the publica
tion of this book is one of the signs of the times. It is
a veritable and practical encyclopedia of commerce, and
adds: "The great evil in France is the desire to stay at
home, the indifference to travel. The French do not
travel, hence everything surprises them. The only cure
for insularity and narrowness is travel. 'Travel! Go
outside!' I say again and again to my countrymen.
Now the book under review would dispense with travel,
were that possible. It puts facts just as they are; in read
ing it one lives .among realities. One is made to under
stand why one nation or man succeeds, and the other
fails. Here are the names of sellers, buyers, banking
houses, commission houses, and even in certain cases
the method of procedure."
Continuing M. Hanotaux says the United States is
high above the commercial horizon. Its attitude v is
menacing, and all eyes are turned to it. With a terri
tory as large as Europe, and a population of 8o,ooo,ooo,
touching the world's two great oceans, and a climate
that ranges from tropical to arctic, and all kinds of min
erals from gold to coal, and all plants from cedar to'
hyssop, and all animals from the whale to the bird of
paradise, the master of all the articles of primary im
portance, iron, cotton, coal and cereals, this colossal
industrial empire is armed to the teeth for the arts of
peace. In freight alone the United States is nearer to
the Mediterranean than Liverpool is to Marseilles.
He sees all of this vast power concentrated to push
its products with an irresistible impulse upon the markets
of the world. But he declares that it is not our match
less industrial discipline alone that accounts for our
power and primacy, for that very discipline has created
a still more intelligently wielded and terrible weapon,
the graduated tariff, continually changed to meet
changed conditions, and modified to coincide with the
progress of the country. Sheltered behind* this, he sees
the American republic forging ahead with astonishing
rapidity and success. Our gates are opened or closed as
the stranger is considered helpful or harmful.
He concludes: "Thus at the beginning of the twen
tieth century the United States faces the world as a
most desirable market on the one hand, and as an awful
menace to manufacturing nations* on the other. Is Eu
rope in general, and each particular power, doomed to
inevitable and irremediable defeat? Is the battle that
is to be fought hopeless? Will the power, prosperity
and progress that have marked the American republic's
movements for a decade continue until they have ob
scured all else? In other words, are we to be confronted
by an American peril more terrible and more pressing
than the yellow ' peril, one that is to wield against the
Old World the weapon before which that Old World is to
go down to irretrievable defeat?"
M. Hanotaux decides that industrial warfare differs
from military war, and that in it both victor and van
quished gain something. As long as we use our tariff
to defend our home market, but also as a means of se
curing reciprocal trade, he believes that the Old World
may prosper on such of our trade as we choose to give
it in return for that which it has and we want. He de
cides that it is useless to try and prevent our commer
cial primacy. But we have the primary materials re
quired by Europe, coal, cotton, iron and petroleum, and
he believes that we endanger the Old World only in the
food supply. Europe wants bur primary materials which
she does not produce. As for France, he believes that
she will never be excelled in the manufacture of luxuri
ous articles which we do not produce, and that with the
inevitable increase in wealth which attends upon our
continued control of the world's commerce, we will al
ways offer to her a profitable market. But he does not
point out the particulars in which the rest of Europe
may find equal comfort, except that those nations may
under the stress and pressure of the American peril
discover in themselves new and unsuspected capacities.
To illustrate such a possibility, he quotes one example
in searching into the capacities of this continent and
using them in our development. As an instance of this
he says: "In 1823, the commander of Fort Dearborn, a
pessimist, wrote to the Secretary of War at Washington:
'I have the honor to inform you that this post should
be abandoned because the country surrounding it is
Brooklyn Navy Yard. Even since
coming to the yard a month ago "she
has managed to strengthen her reputa
tion for bad luck. The carpenters in
charge of the - repair work discovered
a few mc-rnings since that, by the
warping of the props which support
her in an upright position, she had
come within an ace of toppling over.
Such an accident probably wc-uld have
ended her long career aa a ship, for
her old timbers, patched and repatched
for the past hundred years, could hard
ly have resisted such a shock.
If ever a ship was made the special
plaything of mischance, the Constella
tion is that ship. Even now, with her
gun-ports, from which once protruded
the black muzzles of her "long eight
eens," converted into windo-ws, she has
a peculiarly sinister and Irresponsible
appearance. From the day on which
she was launched, September 7, 1797,
her history has been mainly one of
mishaps. She was always well fought
and her flag never came down to an
antagonist. But, as if to make her un
luckiness ail the more unbearable,
some little trick of fate always made
her victories valueless, or turned them
against her.
In the war with France, in 1799, she
managed to administer drubbings to
two French ships at different times,
but in each case a chance shot rendered
her unmanageable; In one instance her
antagonist was enabled to escape, while
in the other a storm almost swamped
her before she could make port. In
the war with Tripoli she was lured un
der a short battery by a fleet of Moor
ish â¢ feluccas, and treated to such a
battering with red-hot balls before she
could get away that she was ordered
back to the United States for repairs.
Finally, in the war of 1812, while all
her sister ships were winning glory on
the high seas, she was blockaded by
an English fleet in Hampton Roads,
and was unable to get out while the
war lasted.
The first fight of the now ancient
frigate was with a French ship, L'ln
surgente, in the early part of 1799. The
Constellation carried twenty-eight
"eighteens"â about as dangerous as the
modern 6-pounder, and good at a range
of half a mile â and twenty-eight , 32
pound carronades, which was the usual
complement cf a thirty-eight-gun frig
ate at that time. In armament the
French ship was rated about the same,
but she carried 409 men to the Con
stellation's 302. The American ship
was commanded by Commodore Trux
ton, and in half an hour the French
man pulled down his flag. A prize crew
was sent aboard from the Constella
tion, but in the midst of the transfer
it was discovered that the Constella
tion had received a stray shot in her
rudder gearing whleh left her about as
manageable as a log of wood. The
shJps were separated and the Constel
lation's crew had all they could do to
keep her from being swamped. On
board the French frigate, the little
American prize crew was in a preca
rious condition. Only a few men had
gone aboard the prize when the storm
came up, and the French crew was
large and inclined to be rebellious. The
Americans ordered their captives be
low, closed the hatches, and, armed to
the teeth, paraded the deck and dared
any of the Frenchmen to show them-
Eelves. After three sleepless days and
nights they managed to make port, to
be rejoined by the Constellation two
days laterâ New York Evening Post.

such that it is impossible for a population to live here
sufficient to justify the expense of keeping a fort at this
place!' In 1893, seventy years later, Chicago, where
that, fort stood, had a population of a million and a
half, and 27,000,000 visited her Columbian exposition."
That conclusion is, of course, cheering to Europe, and
no American will grudge the benefit that may follow the
discovery of new resources and capacities in the nations
across the sea. But it must not be forgotten that they
have been under*the touch of civilized man for ages, and
that he has time and again been put to his mettle in
searching for sustaining resources, as we put him now*
and there cannot be much to find.
Americans will be especially interested in noting the
conclusion of this observant Frenchman, that, we have
not only the resources and industrial discipline, but that
we prevent their waste by our system of tariff, de
nounced in some quarters now as "robbery."

"No," said Mr. Dooley. "Wan iv th' near

day this Bishop dhropped into his club. I
don't know why it is that we always say a
man dhrops into a club. He's more likely
to dhrop out if he ain't supported. But,
anyhow, th' Bishop dhropped into his club
an' hurlin' himself into a sumchuous ar-nn
chnir opened his breevery an' settled down
to wait fr th' evenin' pa-apers. As he Â¦ set
with his feet cocked up on a chair,
rcadin' his devotional book an' occasionally

silf: 'This is rale comfort. A club is a gran'
place.' Suddenly th' thought sthruck him.
'â¢What,' 'lays he, 'am I doin' fr th' poor?
Here am I loungin' in comfort in me club.
Has th' poor vrurnikin' man a club? Not at

go to th' club mostly fr th' same reason.
Ye don't want to go home. He don't need

With interesting and impressive cere
mony Rev. Bernard M. Kaplan, the
newly elected rabbi of the Bush-street
Temple, was installed yesterday morn
ing in his office. The addres was de
livered by Dr. Voorsanger of Temple
Emanu-El, who outlined the functions
and duties of rabbis and teachers in Is
rael. He laid special emphasis on the
educational requisites as well as the
necessity for great piety in a rabbi,
because upon him devolves the duty of
preserving the learning handed down
by the Jewish sages.
Dr. Voorsanger welcomed the new
rabbi to San Francisco and to his con
gregation and expressed a hope that
all in the community would be bene
fited by his coming.
Dr. Kaplan made a short reply, man
ifested his gratification at the cor
diality of his reception by the congre
gation and the people generally. He
agreed with Dr. Voorsanger that Juda
ism stands for higher learning, and
quoted Dr. Voysey of- the Theistic
church of London, who referred to mod
ern Judaism as the religion that can
stand unarmed against the weapons of
modern science. Judaism ethically is
for self-control, said he, and for the
building ud of the character of the In
dividual, and in this upbuilding every
one must be his own savior.
Dr. Kaplan is a fluent talker, using
no manuscript and speaking with great
clearness. More than 700 persons crowd
ed into the temple, among whom were
many old Sacramento friends of the
new rabbi. The doctor will deliver his
inaugural sermon next Saturday morn
ing.

Cabaniss. Valentine was sentenced to
pay a fine of $300 and Burke $100. They
were represented by Attorney George
D. Collins, and Attorney Joseph F.
Coffey conducted the prosecution.
Collins appealed to the Superior Court
and Judges Cook, Lawlor and Dunne,
sitting in bank, affirmed the judgment
of the lower court. Collins immediately
applied for a writ of certiorari, and ar
gument on the application was heard
before Judge Lawlor, who declined to
interfere with the Judgment of the ap
pellate court.
When the remittitur was received by
Judge Cabaniss the defendants did not
pay the fines and they were ordered
into custody. Collins applied for a writ
of habeas corpus before Judge Cook,
and at the same time filed an appeal
to the Supreme Court. When the ap
plication for the writ came up before
Judge Cook for argument Collins ar
gued that the defendants could not be
compelled to pay the fines until the
appeal .to the Supreme Court had been
decided, and the Judge agreed . with
him. The defendants were released on
$300 bonds each pending the Supreme
Court decision.
The Supreme Court has decided
against the appellants, and yesterday
the case was called before Judge Cook
for argument on the writ of habeas
corpus. The court was informed that
pending the decision of the Supreme
Court Defendant Burke had died. Col
lins now raises the point that as the
ordinance under which the defendants
were convicted had been repealed this
has practically acted as a legislative
pardon, and the surviving defendant
should be discharged.
Coffey contended that after the Judg
ment had been affirmed and action
taken by the arrest of the defendants
the repeal of the ordinance was inop
erative. He promised to submit author
ities on the point, and the Judge con
tinued the case till September 2. .
A case that has been' stubbornly
fought on both sides for the past four
years had another hearing in Judge
Cook's court yesterday. It is the case
of W. D. Valentine and M. Burke, who
were arrested in 1900 for running a
"bucket shop" in this city. They were
tried and convicted before Police Judge
The Mayor contends that the amend
ments should be adopted by resolution,
and not by roll call of votes. He points
to the fact that Judge Hebbprd during
Phelan's regime decided that all resolu
tions must go to the Mayor for his ap
proval or disapproval, and, in fact, the
business of the Supervisors must be
done by resolutions or ordinances.
The only " amendment -which the
Mayor approved was That modifying
the dollar limit of taxation by provid
ing for a tax of 85 cents for municipal
expenditures and 15 cents for public
improvements. He vetoed five others,
and was not given an opportunity to
act on nine or ten others.
The Mayor has already evidenced his
Intention to direct the Election Com
missioners not to place upon the official
ballot the amendments which he has
vetoed and those which were not sent
to him. On the other hand, the Super
visors threaten mandamus proceedings
to compel the Election Commission to
place all the amendments adopted by
them on the ballots, and the clerk of
the board is preparing a draft thereof
to be served on the Election Commis
sion. At all events complications are
sure to arise which will throw the dis
pute into the courts for adjudication.
The fact that the Board of Super
visors refused to send to Mayor
Schmitz certain proposed amendments
for his signature because he saw fit to
veto several which had been forwarded
to him will undoubtedly result in court
proceedings to determine the legality
of the board's action ln the premises.
Aside from a Judicial determination
of/ the noint noted, the courts will also
be asked to decide if the Board' of Su
pervisors in fixing on November 8 next
for the submission of charter amend
ments is not violating the constitution
of the State, which provides, according
to the opinion of eminent attorneys who
have been consulted, that charter
amendments shall be submitted at In
tervals of not less than two years, the
last amendment having been submitted
on December 4, 1902.
Mayor Schmitz expressed himself as
rather chagrined at the publication in
The Call of yesterday of the article
pointing out the constitutional provi
sion for biennial amendments to the
charter. His Honor stated that he did
not want to make the matter public for
a while, at least, for obvious reasons.
The Mayor admitted that in all likeli
hood a court decision would be peti
tioned for on the legal interpretation
of the constitutional provision and also
on the validity of the Supervisors' ac
tion in not sending to him their pro
posed amendments, as they had start
ed to do.

The ball given last night in the Me
chanics' Pavilion by the Foresters of
America as a close of the celebration
of Foresters' day was a great success.
The attendance was in excess of 15,000
people, all the floor room being occu
pied besides the tiers of chairs on each
side of the immense dancing space.
When an effort to start the grand
march was made at 9:30 o'clock it
required the exertion of all the mem
bers of the floor and reception com
mittee, with the assistance of the
police, to clear the dancing space. At
a given signal the march was started.
Professor W. J. O'Brien and Mrs. John
J. Cordy, the wife of the grand secre
tary of the order, leading. In this
march at least twenty-five hundred
persons took part and more were will
ing to Join, but there was no room
for them. . It was a serpentine march,
which at the head of the hall was
changed Into a double column and
the effect was one seldom witnessed In
a ballroom. At the termination It was
leudly applauded by the many on
lookers and then the music by an or
chestra of thirty pieces changed from
march time to waltz, and there was a
whirling to the music of "Auf Wieder
sehn." The dance programme was
made up of twenty numbers.
Before the grand march there was
a promenade concert, when the fol
lowing numbers were rendered: -Se
lections from "Roly** Poly," "A Whis
pered .Thought", and "Prince of Pll
sen."

Fred Miller, a clerk In the Railway
Mall Service, pleaded that hÂ» wan La
boring under mental aberration, super
induced by lack of sleep, when ha
grabbed Mrs. Mary Backini's satchel
from her hand as she stood in front of
the Italian Bank on Montgomery street
last Friday afternoon and accused her
of peddling lottery tickets. H* had
been doing double duty on tho Baal
Francisco-Los Angeles run, hs ex
plained, and he was so drowsy whral
he left the train that ho took two ox
three drinks to keep his eyes open and
his senses clear until he could reach
his home and go to bed. The liquor
had the desired optical effect, but in
stead of clarifying his Drain, it muddled
that Important organ until reason gavs
way to hallucination. When he seized
Mrs. Backini's purse he was sure It
contained lottery tickets and that It
was his duty as a good citizen to cap
ture it, and. if protest were made. Uk
prosecute its owner.
Police Corporal O'Meara, wtio ar*
rested Miller, testified that the defend
ant was given an excellent character
by his employers and that the story
of his illusion was evidently true, as
he made no effort to escape with the
satchel after he snatched it, but stood
there Informing Mrs. Backlni that she
ought to be ashamed of herself for sell
ing lottery tickets and breaking the
law. In view of this testimony the case
was dismissed.

When the humiliated "bad man"
stood before Judge Cabaniss yesterday
morning he looked so absolutely de
jected that his Honor continued the
case for one month and allowed him to
go on his own recognizance. "And If
you fail to appear here at the end of
the month," said the Judge. "I will not
be displeased If the explanation is sub
mitted that you have returned to thÂ«
army, for really that is whera a man
of your truculent spirit ought to bÂ«.
It's a shame to see such physical
strength and courage as yours going to

A. I* Brokan, an ex-soldier, had
whipped every Barbary Coast bruiser
worth the whipping and was. yearning
for a foeman worthy of. his fists when
he fell afoul of two policemen last Fri
day night at Pacific and Kearny
streets. His conduct was disorderly
when they accosted him, and it became
more so when they remonstrated. Then
they undertook to arrest him, and with
a laugh of mingled derision, and sur
prise at their temerityâ for surely they
knew of his prowessâ he started to put
them out of commission. "When he.was
able to sit up and ask questions he as
certained that the bluecoat at whom he
aimed his firstâ and lastâ blow was

About two years ago G. Mancinl,
editor of an Italian Journal, was con
victed of libeling a sensitive member of
the Latin colony, and Judge Cabaniss
fined him $200, with the alternative of
fifty days' imprisonment. The judg
ment was. appealed to the Superior
Court, where It hung flre until last Fri
day, when it was sustained. So the
defendant reappeared before his Honor
Judge Cabaniss yesterday, expressed
inability to pay the fine and was sent
to incarceration.
three consecutive days and nights high
wassail had been in progress. As the
result of his round-up eight men ac
cused of drunkenness in a public place
were arrayed before Judge Cabaniss.
They were in various stages of sartorial
dilapidation and most of them were in
evident need of tonsorial attention.
The spokesman for "the group was Ned
Skelly, once upon a time prominent in
minor Republican politics, and he
pleaded logically and with eloquence,
carefully avoiding discrimination in his
defensive effort. He argued that the
seven gentlemen arraigned with him
were no less entitled to the court's
merciful consideration than he was, de
spite the fact that he had not been
drunk for one year prior to the lapse
that led to his arrest He said that be
cause, without attempting to impugn
the intelligence or fairness of Patrol
man Reed, Â¦ he believed there was no
valid reason for the raid. It was true
that a number of. corivlvlally inclined
gentlemen, the defendants. among them,
had assembled in the saloon and had
sung songs . and otherwise enjoyed
themselves, but he would like to enter
positive denial of the complainant's as
sertion that they disturbed the peace
of the neighborhood. That was all, and
he thanked the court for its attention.
"As you gentlemen have already
spent a night in prison," said the Judge,
"I now allow you to go hence to ' free
dom. If any of you should come back
here under similar accusation I will
send you hence to prison. Good-day,
Mr. Skelly."
"Take care of yourself," was Mr.
Skelly's cheery rejoinder as he led the
seven tatterdemalions corrldorward.
In their endeavor to confine China
town's disease germs within China
town's boundaries the city health pro
tecting authorities are balked to some
extent by the enterprise of certain
collectors of junk who cart away and
sell to dealers whatever substances of
value that have defied destruction by
fire. It was for thus conveying Celes
tial microbes from their habitat to the
district south of Market street that B.
Edelstein was arrested by Deputy
Health Inspector J. Bucklin and tried
before Police Judge Cabaniss, who dis
missed the case because there was no
law to warrant conviction.
Mr. Bucklin's description of the ar
rest and Its provoking causes was the
feature of the hearing. "I wouldn't
ha' pinched this fellow," he told the
Judge, "if he hadn't got so fresh. You
see, I knew there was no law to pre
vent the junkies from taking away
the lead and stuff that was left in the
ashes of the bonfires, but I ran a bluff
on them, just the same, and this guy,
Edelstein, was the only one of the
bunch that called me. I caught him
red-handed in the act and here he- is."
"You mean to say that you . caught
him dirty-handed, I supposed?" ven
tured the Judge. â¢
"If you'd rather have it that way
all right," acquiesced Mr. Bucklin.
"Well, this blokey is the only one that
gave me the guff. He took the stuff
away and sold it at Fifth and Har
rison streets."
"I am very sorry,", said the court,
"that there is no ordinance authoriz
ing me to punish this defendant for
his discourteous treatment of you, as
well as for his reckless imperiling of
the public health south of Market
street That district has grievances
enough to contend with and complain
of without having the list augmented
by the importation of Asiatic bacteria.
However, I hope that my inability to
punish the defendant will not discour
age the complaining witness nor deter
him from running his bluff whenever
or wherever he thinks it may promote
the cause of sanitation."
F. R. Collins, an architect's draughts
man, objected to the character of some
people to whom his mother rented a
flat at 1010% Hyde street and to such
extreme did he carry expression of his
displeasure that he was arrested and
charged with disturbing the peace on
complaint of his maternal relative.
"If he don't like the folk in the
house," inquired Mrs. Collins, baptized
Lillian, "why don't he move out of
it?"
Judge Cabanlss passed the query up
to the defendant, who took It under
consideration for a moment and then
agreed to adopt the suggestion. So
with that understanding the case was
dismissed.

CAMP ATASCADERO. Aug. 20.â
Prom a technical, practical and mili
tary standpoint the pioblem of to-day
represented the principal feature of
these maneuvers. There was nothing
of a spectacular nature and the heat
greatly reduced the ardor of the troops
takine part in the actual march. The
problem as evolved ar.d conducted by
General MacArthur was, however,
nevertheless eminently successful and
demonstrated the feasibility and utility
of the Sig-nal Service Corps in keeping
the commanding: officer advi?ed pi the
â¢whereabouts ot his command. During
the entire maneuver, which lasted from
S a. m. until 4 p. m.. General Mac-
Arthur remained at his temporary divi
sion headquarters and from his desk in
his automobile directed the movements
of his troops. He was in direct com
munication, with them at all times.
This Signal Corps service was large
ly experimental, as Major George O.
Scfnler. chief, of the Signal Corps, has
introduced many new inventions,
among them Captain Carl F. Hart
mtun's new wire wagon. General Mac-
Arthur expressed himself as greatly
pleased with the workings of the corps.
. The problem consisted of a Blue divi-
Eion in two columns advancing . from
Paso Roblea toward Santa Barbara.
On the way they camped at Garcia's,
and General MacArthur. here learning
that the Drown force was near Obser
â¢va.tory III 11. determined to send out his
scouts at daybreak and ascertain their
exact position.
The information furnished by the
scouts caused him to Bend out his divi
sion In two columns to try and crush

.to Observatory Hill, where the enemy
was Intrenched.
The enemy, or Brown force, was rep
r.*ented by Troop M. Ninth United
States Cavalry, and cavalry troops A,
B, C and D of the National Guard. The
Kin's were represented by all the
other organizations In camp here.
Major C. E. Haven, Fifth Infantry,

GUERNEVILLE, Aug. 20. â The
feathered owls of Bohemian Grove
hooted to-night at the nimble wit of a
flock of talking and singing city owls,
who annually gather on the banks of
the Russian River and for a season,
brief but joyous, forget the troubles
and worries of the work-a-day' world.
The bird owls hooted because they were
owls and not because of any lack in
the quality of. the Jests and quips that
temporarily upset the domestic peace
of the aristocratic branch of the Strig:
idae family. The city owls quipped and
jested because it v.as the season of the
midsummer jinks, the night set apart
for the cremation of care.
The Bohemian Club's midsummer
jinks of 1904 passed into history to
night and-the celebration was one that
will entttfe* tf rt . to an honored place in
the historic annals of one of the world's
most interesting clubs.
Will Trwin, whose wrote the high
jinks play, "The Hamadryads, a Masque
of Apollo," Is in New York and the pro
duction was sired by Dr. J. Wilson
Shlels, chairman of the jinks commit
tee. The music was composed by W.
J. McCoy and the play was prepared
for presentation by Porter Garnett,
who also designed the costumes. The
betting of the stage was in the artistic
care of George E. Lyon.
The Hamadryads, spirits of the
grove, so the play tells, are liberated
from their trees and from the dominion
of care to celebrate the return of
Apollo.
Care, was cremated with / becoming
solemnity. This burning of trouble Is
the traditional ceremony of the club
and it waa especially elaborate this
year. _Uncle George Bromley, Bohe
mia's high priest, performed the rites
and. John McNaught . delivered the
luneral oration. .
Supper followed the cremation and at
midnight came the low jinks, "The In
imitable Itinerants," .written and sired
by Ernest S. , Simpson. The music for
the owl songs was composed by Dr. H.
J. Stewart. The other melody was bor

and surrounding country yesterday.
The known dead are: M. N. Mitchell,
a. Southern Pacific machinist, and hia
wife; O. D. Wilson, clerk; Charles Sims,
John Epley, Mrs. Hurd and Miss

to Bowie, others were drowned besides
those named in the foregoing list, but
their names are not yet known.
The Gila Valley, Globe and Northern
Railroad tracks were washed out for a
distance of three quarters of a mile.
Telegraphic communication with Globe
Is Interrupted, and It has been Impossi

disaster.
Twenty houses In Globe alone were
washed away. O. D. Wilson and Stan
ley Mentzer by heroic work saved many
lives. Wilson saved a youn^ voman
whom he was to marry, and Is reported
to have then lost his life In trying to
save another.

KINGMAN. A. T.. Aug. 20.â A report
by messenger from Eldorado Canyon.
Nevada, an old mining camp, scventy
flve miles northwest of here, states
that one of the most devastating cloud
bursts In years fell over that place the
afternoon of the ISth. The storm broke
on the mountains west of town and In
Ies3 than ten minutes a river of water
thirty feet deep was rushing down
Nine Mile Canyon. A party of men
with teams and wagons had just ar
rived :n camp and were unhitching
their teams when the deluge came.
They saved but one horse out of their
three teams, the animals and wagons
being washed Into the Colorado River.
The flood swept away the pump house,
blacksmith shop, small mill buildings,
ore wagons, 600 cords of wood, mine
timbers belonging to the Southwestern
Mining Company, tailing pits and
everything in Its path. Huge boulders
were carried Into the Colorado River.

OF THE FLOOD
"You men are not wanted in this
camp. You are not going to be allowed
to live here. You do not seem to be
happy unless you can stir up trouble.
We have had trouble enough. You are
going on and you are not coming back.
If you do there .will be either a bullet
or a rope for every one of you. Now,
go and keep going."
Up to this time there had been no
abuse, but as the men started down
the road a yell went up and the crowd
indulged in threats and jeers.
J. W. Higglns suddenly wheeled upon
the crowd and drew a revolver. He
was promptly struck on the head with
a revolver by one of the crowd and his
own revolver was taken from him and
thrown away. His head was cut and
the wound bled profusely, but he
walked on with the others.
Returning to the city, a part of the
crowd made an attack upon the union
store. Officers at first repulsed the at
tack, but they were overpowered and
about twenty men entered and com
pletely wrecked the stock. The stock
cost about $3000.
To-day's outbreak appears to have
been planned by the miners and inde
pendent of the Citizens' Alliance. No
attempt was made to wreck the union
store.
John W. Hall came to Cripple Creek
two weeks ago from Butte, Mont., rep
resenting the ' Inter-State Mercantile
Company, which' purchased the union
stores here and at Victor from the
Western Federation of Miners.
The store was closed a week ago and
the first'action against it was an order
issued by the Citizens' Alliance forbid
ding the newspapers from advertising
the store and also forbidding miners
to patronize It. The Inter-State is a
Montana concern and was organized so,
as to bring any, interference with the
stores into the Federal court. . .
These men were corralled at various
points in Cripple Creek, beginning at
5 o'clock, and" at 6;30 o'clock, when all
had" been herded together, they were
started over the hills west of town and
marched toward Floissant under a
heavy armed zuard.
Just as the miners were going on
shift at 6 o'clock they were stopped and
formed into a crowd which marched
through the streets, gathering known
union men and sympathizers together
practically as prisoners.
The first to be taken was Engly.
Next the crowd picked up Cole and
Hangs, attorneys for the Western Fed
eration of Miners. It then marched to
the union store and took John W. Hall,
the manager, from the place. The
crowd then gathered in front of the
Courthouse and v?aited there for other
union men to be apprehended.
The expressed design of the mob was
to hold the union men together and
march them over the hills and out of
the district. The claim was made that
a conspiracy had been discovered to
commit violence and that the prompt
deportation of union men would pre
vent further bloodshed.
Under a guard of 2000 men the pris
oners were escorted to a point on the
old Canyon City stage road three
miles from the | city. The spokesman
stepped forward and said:

of the polo played, the southerners be

ingly unable to check the steady play
and brilliant rushes of the northern
men. Time and again by good individ
ual work Riverside would . get the ball
straightened out for a run toward goal,
but invariably the hitter was ridden off
and there was no one following to car
ry along the ball. On the other hand,
the Burlingame men backed up one an
other well and did not get badly
bunched at any period of the game.
Riverside's single score, which came
toward the last of the game, , was the
best of the team play and was as fairly
earned as any one ever made on the
polo field. Praed and Joe Tobln came
together , in the second period at the
Riverside's goal line when Burlingame
had scored. Praed's pony staggered and
rolled over in the dust. He was unhurt.
Dick Tobin played a rattling good num
ber three and hit accurately and hard.
He scored six of the nine goals credited
to his side. Tom Driscoll was responsi
ble for the other three. ' The teams
lined up to-day as follows: Burlingame
â F. J. Carolan, T. A. Driscoll, R. M.

SEAMEN'S INSTITUTE TEAM
WINS THE CRICKET MATCH
Seven rounds of fast boxing consti
tuted the major .-portion of Jack Mun
roe's work yesterday afternoon. As
the day was a delightful one, the train
ing quarters were fairly besieged with
anxious ones who wanted to see the
miner at work. When the gym was
filled a big crowd, had to be turned
away.
The miner went two rounds each
with McCoy, Chester and Sullivan and
one with Andy Gallagher. As usual,
the Kid played foxy with the big
fellow and tried to work him up fast.
In this he was successful, for Jack was
willing to so the pace, and he landed
some good stiff jolts on the shifty Kid.
He also went after Chester at a fast
gait, landing a few hooks that made
the latter wince.
Sullivan roughed it to a great ex
tent and this seemed to suit the miner
to a dot, for he just bored in and made
the crowd cheer when he got his man
in a corner and began to put the hard
ones home. The one round with Andy
Gallagher was fast and had lots of
fight in it. At one time he rushed
Andy into a corner, where McCoy
caught his hands. Munroe did not see
this and was about to send in a few
deadly swings when Andy asked for
protection and an even break.
The picture crew Invaded the camp
yesterday and made a number of
photos for the biograph. The miner
posed with his sparring partners,
punching the bag and running and
jumping on the road. He will rest
to-day with the exception of a ten
mile joe on the road in the afternoon.
Monday and Tuesday will be red
letter days at the miners' training
quarters. He will so ten rounds on
each occasion just as hard as he Is
capable of going, and this will practi
cally wind up his work. On Wednes
day he will take a rest and It Is not
expected he will do much work from
that time on.

SARATOGA, N. Y., Aug. 20.â Upon a
sloppy track, the result of twelve hours
of almost incessant rain, the beautiful
three-year-old filly Beldame set the
seal upon her fame by winning the
Saratoga cup, at one mile and six fur
longs. She carried weight for age, 10S
pounds, and defeated Africander, The
Picket, Gaughnawaga and Major Daln
gerfield, in 3:03 4-5, nearly six seconds
slower than the track record of 2:58,
which is also the world's record.
The difference in time is accounted
for by the difference in the course to
day as compared with the course on
the cup day last- year, when the ad
mirably handled Africander, with Ful
ler up, defeated Heno a head in one of
the most thrilling races of the yean
.The cup failed to bring out the con
test looked for, Beldame proving so
much the best that at no stage of the
journey was there a question as to her
winning. O'Neil's orders were to go to
the front and make things merry, and
this he did in a style that In'the'opin
ion of many makes her the greatest
mare seen in years. For the first mile
there was little disposition shown by
the others to go after her, but when the
attempt was made there was no per
ceptible closing of the gap. In fact
O'Nell was looking back over his shoul
der while the others were driving hard.
At the.- finish Beldame was five
lengths in front of Africander, "which
was a half length in front of The Pick
et. Caughnawaga tired badly at the
end of one mile and three furlongs.

Big Orval Overall won the hearts of
the San Francisco baseball fans yester
day at Recreation Park, just as he
often captured the admiration of thou
sands of football rooters. The college
giant loomed up majestically on the
slab while the multitude cheered. In
every inning save two he baffled the
best batsmen San Francisco can boast
of. Score â Tacoma 6, San Fran
cisco 3.
The largest Saturday crowd In the
history of Recreation Park was on
hand to give the Rah! Rah! Rah hero
a reception that would make any man
feel proud. There were Berkeley root
ers and Stanford rooters and the regu
lar baseball rooters, but they all united
in cheering the big slab artiEt when he
stepped into the middle of the diamond
for the first time.
All the college man needed was con
trol. He was lacking in this respect,
otherwise he would have achieved a
victory that might furnish the fans
gossip for months to come. To his cred
it he had a wild pitch and six walks,
one of them turning into a run. But at
that, he was ever cool and effective
beyond description in the tight places.
Errors lost the game for Corbett. He
pitched brilliant ball, but contributed
to his own defeat with a wild pitch
and two misplays that allowed three
Tigers to pounce upon the pan. His
fielders were nervous and were always
.making the wrong kind of a play at the
â¢wrong time. The Tigers managed to
amass most of their runs with two
men out. .
Not since that eventful Sunday after
noon when the redoubtable Rube Wad
dell made playthings out of the then
champion San Franciscans has a pitch
er displayed the speed Overall did yes
terday. He used a straight, fast ball
most of the time, varying it with a
drop occasionally and an out-curve that
was effective. He struck out three men
in two innings, but after that did not
play for the fanning honors much.
A bad error put the Tigers three
ahead In the third inning. There were
two down and out when Doyle hit to
Gochnauer and traveled to second on
the latter's bad throw of a beautiful
stop. Sheehan cut loose a drive to right
and Doyle landed on third. Anderson
had a dope streak and threw the ball in
bad form. Sheehan advanced a base,
and both came in after Nordyke hit to
right. Eagan's bingle brought Dyke
home.
Overall had two stowed away and
Hildebrand on second in the third when
Charley Irwin popped up a "Texas
leaguer" to right, bringing the run in.
The Tigers broke it up for fair In the
seventh, when two hits, coupled with a
wild pitch and an error at the plate by
Corbett, let the Tigers take three.
After that it was easy sailing for them,
though one bad breaker appeared in
the eighth.
It was then that Corbett and Wal
dron swung through with singles after
Overall began to let down a bit. Nor
dyke fumbled Hildebrand's hit, and it
was a full house. Van Buren smacked
a smart one down to Truck Eagan, and
in a twinkling a double play was pulled
off. Corbett scored and Waldron land
ed soon after on Charley Irwin's beau
tiful three-cushion swing to deep cen
terâthe best of its kind this year. , "- :
The fast double play helped to get
Overall out of a mean hole, but at
that he seemed to know what he was
doing, and Van Buren was rather
afraid of the big fellow's speed. He
held the locals safe in every other In
ning, pitching masterly ball when he
settled down.
Barber will pitch against St. Vrain
this morning at Oakland. Whalen and
Thomas are to oppose each other in the
afternoon. The score:

OAKLAND PULLS OUT AHEAD.
SEATTLE, Aug. 30. â Oakland
turned the tables on Seattle to-day
and won out in the ninth inning.
From beginning to end it was a neck
and neck fight, with many exciting
plays and a few bad errors. Pitcher
Williams threw the ball awav twice,
the last throw giving Oakland two
runs. Every time he made an error
he followed it with a sensational piece
of fielding. Jones outpitched Williams
at critical points. On one occasion
he was in a bad hole with Frisk, the
champion batter, up. Frisk was
anxious to hit, but struck out. The

WHITEWASH FOR BROWMES.
PORTLAND, Aug. 20. â Dolly. Grey
dropped the Brownies into a barrel to
day and then clapped on the lid. Not
a run did he allow. The fielding of
the Loo Loos was a fine exhibition..
In the first inning the Browns went
out in order, while Smith scored with
the aid of Cravath. Not another run
did the visitors make until the sixth,
the interim being a dra^jftght'When
the sixth opened Bernard' beat out a
bunt, Flood barely made first on a
hot one to Raymond. Smith's bunt
was thrown wild by Steelman and in
the excitement Bernard got home.
The Browns did not improve their/
opportunity in the seventh. Drennan
hit to right. Beck flew out and Cas
tro sacrificed and the gloom deepened
a moment after. The big- disappoint
ment came in the ninth, when only
Drennan and Beck made bases and
Castro, Raymond and Nadeau went
out Th^last runs were made on

CHICAGO, Aug. 20. â H. Chandler
Egan of Exmoor won the "Western golf
championship at Highland Park to
day for the second time. He defeated
D. E. Sawyer of Wheaton in thj
thlrty-slx hole finals, 6 up o to play.
The only period in the game -when the
big gallery golfers who followed thÂ»
two players thought Egan In danger
was when Sawyer, by a brilliant two
under "bogey" play, took the first two
holes. The weather conditions were
excellent. In the long game Egan was
better, invariably, than his rivaL Hi3
short game was Invincible and the
hard luck that came to Sawyer was
mostly due to his own erratic work.
Of the subordinate events decided,
Walter Egan, the defeated champion,
won the Directors' cup from K. L.

champion, won the North Shore Cup,

to before the fight. All I can say is
that I am going to fight to win. I
shall finish my training at the Reliance
Club, where I will begin work Monday
morning."
Â¦
Brown as a berry from exposure to
the burning sun at Harbin Springs,
showing in every movement the effect
of the hard training of the past two
weeks, Champion James J. Jeffries re
turned unexpectedly to Oakland last
night to complete his preparation for
his coming battle with Jack Munroe.
Accompanying the champion were
Mrs. Jeffries, Billy Delaney and his
wife, Jack Jeffries, Joe Kennedy,
George Miller of Los Angeles, Dick Ad
ams. Eddie Hanlon and Colonel Martin
Brady. Jeff went direct to his old quar
ters at the Hotel Metropole. The heat
in the mountains drove him down to
the cooler climate of Oakland.
The big fellow looks the picture of
health, and is well satisfied with his
present condition. He will take things
easy to-day, and will rest after % his
trip from the springs. To-morrow
morning he will begin putting the fin
ishing touches on his condition. Jeff
has but little to say regarding the ap
proaching fight, but what he does say
proves that while he does not hold the
husky miner in contempt he is never
theless confident of proving himself
Munroe's master. Jeff said:
."I am in first-class condition, and am
ready to step Into the ring at a mo
ment's notice. Of course I believe I
shall win, but I have not taken any
chances with my condition, and I will
say this, that if I lose it will be be
cause Munroe is the best man. I am
not going to lose.
"As far as my knee Is concerned It
is as good as ft ever was â in fact, I
think it is now the best of the two.
Now that Is a fact. I have noticed
that since I had the 'bad' knee treat
ed, if either of them feels at all stiff
after a long walk or a sprint It is the
one that was not hurt. So none of my
friends need have any fear that Mun
roe will fight a cripple. My hands are
also in fine shape.

Movements of Steamers.
A large number of Futurity candi
dates were given an airing yesterday at
Union. Coursing Park in a stake for
non-winners. A number of promising
young greyhounds were shown.
The surprise of the day was the de
feat of Rocker Arm, the 1 to 15 choice,
by Camber, a son of Vandal. The
puppy led, and. although he won by a
9 to 6 score, he showed a lack of ex
perience. Confident, by Fetter Free,
and La Rosa, by Gambit, showed they
possessed class. Confident led the fast
Duhallow a length. \
Rose of Gold and Racing Auto are
the overnight favorites for the stake,
each being quoted at 8 to 1 in the long
odds book. Hudson and Crawford Belle
are each at 10.
For the class stake Barge is at 2 to
1; McVey at 3; Richard Anton, 4; Char
ter Member, 5; Rector, 6. The others
are at varyine odds up to 50. the latter
being thWFice about Renegade Apache.

the good weather yesterday and the
courts were crowded throughout the
day. Many practice matches were
played by the cracks, who are condi
tioning themselves for the coming
championship tournaments. The Hardy
brothers and Drs. Hill and McChesney
put up a fine exhibition in doubles. Dr.
Sumner Hardy and Dr. McChesney
played together, while Dr. Samuel
Hardy and Dr. Hill joined forces. Two
long deuce sets were played, each side

He was considerably out of practice.
Harry Rolfe won three sets from him

the second match. After losing the
first two sets he took the third and
fourth and almost won the fifth.

Makes Splemiid Passage.
The American bark Homeward Bound,
CajAain Thompson, which arrived Fri
uy r.ight from Antwerp, made a splen
di<l passage, coming from the Old
Yw'orld yort in 127 days. The Homeward
Bound was formerly the German Ehlp
Utto.GilderaeiEter. and her arrival here
some yearb ago long after hope for her
had been abandoned is still remem
bered by the reinsurance speculators,
Â¦who thought they had cleaned up a
handsome profit. They had bought her
'"to arrive" at SO per cent, and there was
j?re-at rejoicing when the overdue ship,
dismantled and barnacled, came limp
lr?s into port. Joy was shortlived,
however, as the vessel was declared a
constructive loss, and en that basis the
speculators were compelled to settle.

The surprise of the running at In
gleside Coursing Park yesterday was
the d\efeat of Sir Winton by Star Syl
vanus. The talent made Winton a
1 to 5 favorite. He never had a look
in, being defeated pointless. This is
an unusual occurrence for a top
heavy favorite to be shut out.
The victory of Jerry Wright over
Carlow Boy was another . disastrous
upset to the form players. Carlow
Boy sold a l*to 4 favorite. This was
a false price to lay against Jerry. He
is not unusually fast, but there is no
chance for the other dog when he
once gets possession of the hare.

Should Give a Good Account
of Himself in the Open
Stake at Ingleside Park
Flora early yesterday morning until
sundown a procession of vessels of all
sorts and sizes came blowing In
through the Golden Gate. Quarantine
and custom-house officials had a busy
day and long before dark the anchor
age off Meiggs wharf was crowded as
it has not been for many days.
The arrivals numbered more than
v.vo dozen and included twelve coasting
schooners, most of them lumber laden
and nearly all from northern ports;
two barks, one barkentine. a ship and
half a dozen steam schooners.
The- ship was the Thornliebank,
reventy-iilne days from Newcastle,
Australia, with a cargo of coal, 3279
tons of IL
The barks Andrew Welch and Emily
"VVnitisey brought sugar from Hawaiian
ports and the Bchooner General Ban
ning was loaded with cedar logs from
Soledad.
Thcfcnas Crov.iey on the Guide, flag
ship of the gasoline launch fleet, choo
c-hooed closer to the Emily F. Whitney
while the was in quarantine than the
Federal law allows. Surgeon Cumming,
head of the quarantine service, gave
chase in the General Sternberg. No
Khots were fired across the launch's
bow, but a capture was effected, Crow-
K.<y was taken aboard the quarantine
steamer and a prize crew placed in
charge of the Guide. Launch and
owner iverc taken to Angel Island,
urfiere the powers that administer the
quarantine laws had a heart-to-heart
t^lk with the head of the gasoline
launch trust. Crowley explained that
his proxttnity to the Whitney was due
to a temporary derangement of the
optic nerves, which prevented his see
isÂ£ the yellow flag. He promised to
be good in the future. His promise
was noted, but- before restoring his
freedom the doctors gave Crowley what
in quarantine -circles is known as the
ninety-seventh degree.
His clothes were taken away, boiled
in disinfectants and then dried in a
'fame-filled oven. While this was going
on 'two strong attendants gave the
launch magnate an anti-plague bath.
"V^hen.he left, the island his shoes,
Â¦which had been boiled and roasted with
the rest of his wearing apparel, pinched
BSdiy ami the fashionably cut blue suit
in which he had stepped ashore was a
pad, purple colored thing that clung
closely to form and limb. A brown
necktie had turned pink and his watch
had stopped at 11:15 o'clock.
i *T11 remember, doctor," said Crow-
Icy as the Guide moved away from the
Quarantine station wharf.

\i Â¦
j To men who have from any cause lost the buoyant spirits, the courage and confidence which
â¢ belong to the perfect man. To you I offer new life, fresh courage and freedom from the effects of
2 the past.
; e Show me the man who would not be a better man than he is. It matters not how the rocks
; Â® and shoals of life have worn the edge off the spirit of joyousness, have dulled the enthusiasm of
1 youth >and left the nerves less vigorous, the eye less bright, the step less springy, the mind less
. â¢ forceful and the general vitality less powerful than they ought to be at your age; you want to be
' S strong. Electricity applied my way makes men feel young.
i g â¢ Â¦ â¢ '
I q I want to talk to men \vho have pains and aches, who feel ran down physically, who realize that
the old "fire" and energy which were so evident in youth are absent now; men who can't stand the
0 amount of exertion they could years ago. I want you â if that means you â to see what I have done for
O others who were just as bad off. That's my introduction. If a friend in whom you had confidence pre-
â¢ sented some one to you and said: "Jack, here's Brown; he has made good with me, and I trust him,"
Â® wouldn't you trust him, too?
2 Mr. Arnold F. Berfi of Marshall, Marin County, Cal., sent this reply to a man who asked him what
5 I had done for him:
a "In answer to your letter regarding my opinion of Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt, would say that it is a godsend
q gift to all suffering humanity. In my case I was a long time sufferer from weak back and vital weakness. It cured
Z me entirely in a few weeks, and since using it I am like a new man. The Belt does not burn or blister the skin. All
J? you can feel is a gentle, invigorating glow, which strengthens the weakened tissues, and there is no reaction, as
J* some people think. I gladly recommend it to you and pledge you my word it is all they claim."
â¢ Now, if you 1 don't feel right, I can cure you with my Electric Belt. If you are full of rheumatic
0 pains, I can knock them out. I can pour oil into your joints and limber them up. I have often said that
, â¢ pain and electricity can't live in the same house, and I prove it every day.
â¢ Mr. L. J. Barnett of Tillamook. Ore., writes: "Your treatment certainly does what no other can. for It has cured
Â© me. I cannot praise the Belt too highly and gladly recommend it in any case of vital weakness."
2 If It were not for the prejudice due to tlie srreat number of fakes In the land Z would not te able to ftardla the
! 2 business that wonld come to me. The "Free Belt" fraud and the "Free Draff" scheme, which are not free at all, havo
9 mads every one skeptical, bat I know that I have a rood thinsr, and I'll hammer away .until yon know it.
2 One thing every man ought to know is this: Your body is a machine. It runs by the steam in
I S your blood and nerves. When you begin to break down in any way you are out of steam. That's just what
: 9 I want to give you back.
O I have a cure In every town. Tell me where yon live, and I will srive yon the name of a man I've cured.
â¢ Tell me your trouble, and I will tell you honestly whether I can cure you or not. If I can't care
5 you I don't want your money. I have been in this business 24 years, and I am the biggest man in it to-
S day by long odds, and I am growing yet, because I give every man all he pays for.
q Now, wouldn't you rather wear my life-giving, appliance while you sleep every night, and feel its
O glowing warmth pouring into you and feel yourself taking on a new lease of life with each application
O than clog your intestines up with a lot of nauseous drugs? Surely. Try me.
9 Mr. Abraham Spady of Alcatraz, Cal., writes: "I am cured of all my former ailments, and you have my heart-
Â© felt gratitude for what your treatment has done for me."
S If you will come and see me I'll explain it to you. If you can't call, let me send you my book, full
S of the things a man finds inspiring to strength and courage. Free if you send this ad.

CONVENE IN YREKA.
OAKLAND, Ang. 20. â H. A. C.
Kauffmann, a rancher living near Mel
rose, narrowly escaped death this aft
ernoon under the wheels of a nar
row gauge locomotive which struck
his ivagon at the corner of Third and
Webster streets, smashing the vehicle
to splinters and injuring both the
hcrses so badly that they had to be
shot. Kauffmann escaped from the
general wreck by a close margin, for
he leaped from the seat of his wagon
not five seconds before it was struck
by the pilot of the locomotive.
Kauflmann was on his way home
when the accident happened, and tried
to cross, the tracks just as the 1:45
o'clock p. m. train, southbound, ap
proached the crossing. He tried to
turn out of the way, but the horses
became unmanageable and a moment
later the crash followed. There is a
high fence on the corner where the
accident happened and this obscured
Kauffmann's view so thaÂ£ he. did not
see the oncoming train until his horses
were almost on the track.

Joseph R. Knowland was dug out. of
the Alameda city delegation, where he
was working .away for* the ibeneflt of
the party that had: so lately . honored
him, and Breed asked him to say-some
thing to ; his.; fellow delegates. Know
land.said:.. , .. Â¦ . ; ; .'":-;Â£
"Governor George C. Pardee. has; told

The appearance of the i Governor
was the signal for applause, . the
length and strength of which were' a
distinct compliment, even though it
came,frpm his own home.. The Gov
ernor had a few words to say about
his Eastern trip and about President
Roosevelt. He said:
. "I have been a sort 'of . exile 'from
my old home for the last two years,
and I have lived away from my old
friends to a certain extent under pro
test. Eut I am always glad to come
back and grasp the. hands of old
friends and see the old familiar faces.
' "I want to say a word tfbout our
great . standard "bearer, Theodore
Roosevelt. I have had' the honor of
talking to him very recently and I
was astonished to find how much he
knew not only about California, ' but
about Alameda County and Oakland.
I told him that the people of Alameda
County were always right and that
they, could be trusted to roll up the'old
time majority for the Republican
ticket, and as I look into the earnest
faces'. before, me I know; that I told
him the truth. -
"I am glad to be able to say a few.
words to you one more; I am glad to
be back in' Oakland again and to visit
my old home and my old friends. But
I shall, be doubly proud of Alameda
County .'if I see that next November
my old home has stood by the Repub
lican ticket from top to Â¦ bottom."
KNOWLAND SPEAKS.
OAKLAND. Aug. 20. â The Repub
lican County Convention to-day 'de
veloped no trouble and plenty of en
thusiasm. The harmony of the event
augurs well for the success of the few
nominees that were placed before the
people. Governor George C. . Pardee
was present and made a little ad
dress to his townsmen. Joseph R.
Knowland, the new nominee of the
Republican party for Congress in the
Third District, came as a plain dele
gate from Alameda, doing his duty as
a member of the party and he had a
few words to say when he was haled
out of the mass of delegates on the
floor. The nominating addresses were
by prominent Republicans and alto
gether the gathering to-day was a
strong and earnest 'one.
Following the usual procedure the
convention was called to order by the
chairman of the â¢ Republican County
Committee, Clarence Crowell. Crow
ell declared that the first duty of the
convention would be to invite Gover
nor ' Pardee to address them and he
appointed a committee to perform
this duty, composed of Frank K. Mott,
Mortimer Smith and Eugene Stephen
son. they were! carrying out
their duty the conventiorimtms organ
ized by the election of A; H. Breed as
chairman and Charles E. Thomas and
Ed S. Finch as secretaries. Breed said
a few words, predicting a tremendous
Republican majority, and then Gov
ernor Pardee was announced.
WARMLY RECEIVED."
The work of the convention was en
tirely divided into districts, for there
was not a single nominee -at- large in
.thef county. . There were three Super

, "We Indorse the Hon. George C. Per

splendid service in the affairs of the
nation has been truly representative of
the high ideals of his party and of the
growing Importance to -his State. ~
'?- "The State of California may well be
congratulated upon' the administration
of Governor Pardee. Every institution
and every industry has been given most
careful consideration. We recognize In
him a Governor whose constant aim is
to better the life of his people and pro
tect the interest of his State. .
"We heartily congratulate the Repub
licans of this district upon the selection
of the= Hon. Joseph R. Knowland . of
Alameda as their candidate, for Repre
sentative in the Congress of the United
States. His record in the Legislature
of this State' is one of which he may
well be proud, and his great experience

loyal support, with the ' fuir assurance

government that upright citizen,
George C. Pardee. We have in the Cab

er, Victor H. Metcalf. What more could
Alameda County ask from the Repub
lican party... and Alameda County has
only to show its appreciation by giving
a big majority for Theodore Roosevelt
and the entire Republican ticket."
The convention then got down to
hard business and the usual commit

ponages andÂ« candidates said:
INDORSES LEADERS. ,
roll up a tremendous majority for The
odore Roosevelt and the Republican

fore has there been such a united party
as at present. The opposition would
have you believe that there is internal
dissension and strife, but that is only a
trick of the enemy.
VENTURA, Aug. 20.â At the county
convention of the Democrats held to
day a full ticket was nominated. It
consisted of three Supervisorial candi
dates and an Assemblyman, the latter
to oppose Colonel D. T. Perkins, who
stands for Senator Bard. Strong reso
lutions were passed condemning Bard
for his action in denying statehood to
Arizona and opposing the election of
Senators .by direct vote of the people.
Major W. Moultrie of Santa Paula was
made the nominee for the Assembly,
while for Supervisors F. Hartman was
nominated In the First District,
Thomas Clark in the Third and Wil
liam Borchard.in the Fifth; ; / Â¦ Â¦]
The resolution regarding. Senator
Bard was a decided surprise to the
Bard people of the county, as It. had
been stated that the Democrats of the
county would not even nominate acan
didate to oppose the Bard candidate

Most unique of all the devices to
raise money to pay student debts is
that proposed by the executive com
mittee of the Associated Students of
the University of California, by which
$10,000 or $20,000 will b/2 secured
through a bond issue. The new foot
ball field is going to cost the studants
several thousand more dollars than
was at first thought, and this burden,
which is made all the more arduous
On account of other undertakings by
the collegiate body, calls for some
rapid, and effective financiering to re
lieve the pressure.
The proposed bond issue will be in
every cense a popular affair.- Every
student will be entitled to purchase
the bonds. Whether interest will be
paid for the use of the money is a
question yet to be decided, though it
is likely that a small rate will be al
lowed in order to stimulate the sale.
As this is the first time that a bond-
Ing scheme _ on this order has been
proposed for colleg-e students, it will
require some ingeunity to get it into
presentable shape. Graduate Manager
Ezra Decoto, who originated the
scheme, is working up the details now,
so that when the executive committee
of the student body meets next week
there will be something tangible to
work upon.

Ordered away from a house at the
point of a pistol where she went to
collect a bill, Mrs. Emma Verwiebe
.ETkore to a complaint before Justice of
the Peace W. 11. Geary this morning,
chargrinj? Mrs. George Robinson of
Ar.endale with having made threats
against her life. She was much
wrought up over the occurrence and
'm> frightened when the pistol was
fired by the Irate Mrs. Robinson that
she ran until she had to stop from
cheer exhaustion. Mrs. Robinson fired
one shot through the veranda to con
vince her creditor that the pistol was
loaded.
In explaining the matter to Judga
Gears* Mr?. Verwiebe said that she
conducts a little store on Short street
near Penniman avenue, in North
Fruitvale. She claims Mrs. Robinson
owes her a bill, which she has tried
to collect on several occasions, and
â¢ this morning she went to the Robinson
heme ;md asked for the money. With
out saying anything Mrs. Robinson
â¢went into the house and returned with
a pistol. She tired a bullet through
the roof of the porch and she then
told 'Mrs. Verwiebe to leave the place
with the threat that If she ever pre
sented the bill again she would shoot
her full of holes.
Mrs. Verwiebe took the forcible
hint and left, but only to swear out
a warrant against the woman behind
the gun.
In regard to the affair, George A.
Robinson, the husband of the woman
fur whom the warrant was issued, said
this evening: "'It is true that my wife
showed A! re. Verwiebe a pistol and or
dered her away from the premises. She
lives next door and I think is -a little
wror.p in her head and makes life very
unpleasant. The last persons who lived
in ihe house we occupy had to leave on
' account of her. I got the pistol and
; told my to frighten her if she
came around. There were only blank
cartridges in it and we have nothing In
the house to load it with. I am in busi
â¢ ness In this city and do not owe a dol
lar except at this woman's store. She
has never presented us with a bill and
1 am ready at any time to pay it. . I
think it amounts to about $6. I don't
. think my wife shot the pistol, but she
dk! show It to her and ordered her
cway."
information of tha whereabouts of Albert
Waldrnan. occupation ateam or gas fitter,
will be thankfully received and suitable ex
penses allowed. Address SHERIFF LAMB,
Winncmucca, Humboldt County, Nevada.
Frank. W. Mulock, an Eastern news
paper correspondent, saw the "ad." He
had met Waldman and learned he had
gone to one of the nearby mining
camps. ' Acting on that information,
Mr. Mulock began his search and after
diligent seeking for many days located
Waldman. Waldman says he was one
of the -victims of a hold-up and robbery
at Winnemucca about a year ago, in
which his friend, Jack Welch, was
killed. George Severner, Jake Lind
man, Tony Rizt and Fred Gorman were
convicted and sentenced to hang for
the crime, but were granted a new trial
by the Nevada Supreme Court. - -
Waldman'8 presence is much desired
as chief witness against the accused
and he will leave for Winnemucca to
day. ;-â¢'â¢

The fruit market had a 1 healthier ten* under
the stimulus of the warm, sunny weather, to
gether, with the usua! oxtra demand for Sun-'
day requirements. . and .prices of several de
olduous varieties were higher. Green Bart
lett Pears in bulk were firm. at the recently
established . prlcrs under a good call" for can
ning purposes, but matured stock was 'n ex
cessive supply, and dull, with plenty of over
ripe stock to be had belnvr the minimum quo
tations. Peaches in small' packages were abun
dant and firm , for the best offering?, while
poor stock dragged. Offerings In large open
boxes- consisted almost entirely of Freestones. '
which ruled weak at unsteady .rates. There
wire' not enough Clingstor.es on. the market .
for a quotation, but dealers reported that the
earners were willing to- pay $4O#5O per ton
for ifancy stock/ 'Apples were steady. ' wfth
occasional sales of extra fancy reported at a
Might advance over the maximum d.'eistation.
Plums, Prunes, and Grapes in crates' were
steady under Â» (food call, both for local use
and- shipping account. Grapes in large boxes
were pit nti ful . and .weak, and as. the bulk cf
the day's rec?lnts came to h.ir.d late quite a
surplus had to be carried over. Old and 'poor
lots ct Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons wire
pretty well cleaned .up and fresh arrivals did
better.- Watermelons moved off more freely,
but supplies - were too heavy â to permit any
advance in prices. Huckleberries were'plen

LONDON. Aug. 2O.âThe British
Government continues to watch with
the closest attention the policy of
China in respect to the Russian cruis
er Askold and the torpedo-boat de
stroyer Grozoboi at Shanghai, but it
has not departed from its decision to
regard the question as one which con
cerns particularly Russia, Japan and
China. Respecting the use of the
British dock at Shanghai by the As
kold, the Government holds that this
fact does not relieve China of the duty
of enforcing neutrality.
Japan, according to the Japanese
legation, cannot afford to blockade a
neutral port indefinitely. The legation
points out the case" of the Russian
gunboat Mandjor, Admiral Togo be
ing compelled to keep a cruiser and
a torpedo-boat off Shanghai for two
months before she finally was dis
armed, and the legation asserts that
the Government of Japan will not re
peat such a conciliatory policy In the
case of a vessel like the Askold, which
has high speed and could do great
damage to, commerce.
Expects the Peking Government to
Enforce Neutrality.

ST. LOUIS, Aug. 20.â The Visayan
pupils, twenty-five In number, who
have been studying In the model school
in the Philippine section at the World's
Fair, refuse to attend the classes in the

The action Is explained In a letter
which has been received by H. S. Stone
from Miss Teresa Ramlres, a 16-year
old pupil of the school, who had read
and taken umbrage at that portion of
the folder recently Issued by the Philip
pine exposition board describing the
village and exhibits of the Philippine
Islands at the World's Fair, in which
the pupils of the school are classified
as "little savages."

BOSTON. Aug. 20.â The G. A. R. en

meeting of a family of two brothers
and two sisters who had not been to

W. F. Toothaker, who served in a

The two went on to Chicago, where
they met a sister, Mrs. Ellen Ronk of
Kewanee, 111., the meeting of the three
being the first in forty-seven years.
Arriving In Boston, the trio werÂ© met
by another sister, Mrs. Pierce. She had
not seen William in forty years, Daniel
in fifty-one years and her sister in fifty
years. They will all go next week to

TSINGCHOU, Aug. 20.â The Japa
nese protected cruiser Yayeyama haa
Just anchored here and landed Major
Hoffman, the German military attache
who was at Port Arthur. The major
left the fortress in a Junk at the Ger
man Emperor's orders. The Japanese
cruiser picked him up thirty miles out
and. It is reported* confiscated his pa
pers. Major Hoffman's personal bag
gage was left on the Junk.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press to-day asked Captain Matouse
vitch, chief of staff to the late Admiral
Withoeft, who Is now In the hospital
here, what lessons he deduced from
the naval fight of August 10. The cap
tain was too weak to reply at length,
but he said conclusions might be drawn
from the fact that the ten and twelve
inch guns were accurately served and
did most of the damage, and that while
the Russian vessels were at one time
beset by thirty-six Japanese torpedo
boats and destroyers, the fire of these
smaller craft was verr inaccurate and
did very little damage.
Captain Matousevitch does not believe
that the rudder shaft of the battleship
Cesarevitch was hit by a torpedo, as
was at first reported. Eight torpedoes
were discharged at the Cesarevitch, but
not one of them struck her.
JAPANESE ARE CAUTIOUS.

CHICAGO, Aug. 20.â A sugar rate
war has been declared by the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul Road, which
announces reductions in the tariffs
from Chicago west and northwest
amounting to 15 and 22 cents. The re
duced rates are effective Immediately.
The rates announced are 5 cents per
100 pounds from Chicago to Missouri
River Points between Kansas City and
Sioux City, including Sioux Falls, and
5 cents from Chicago to the Twin Cities
and the common points in the North
west. The former rates were 27 cents
to the Missouri River points and 20 to
the Twin Cities. The reductions make
a rate of 30 cents from New York to
all the points named, which is consid
erably lower than the rates from New
Orleans to the same points.
The war was started because some of
the Southwestern lines are said to have
refused to abide by the adjustment
made months ago, when the rates from
New Orleans to Missouri River points
was made 37 cents. A combination,
through Memphis, of 32 cents from
New Orleans to Kansas City was later
discovered and not adjusted.

L.OS ANGELES, Aug. 20.â Because
the girl he loved and who loved him re
fused to marry him, although her only
reason was that she was too young and
she simply asked him to wait, John H.
Perrln shot himself through tha head
In her presence this afternoon. The
tragedy was enacted In Hollywood, a
beautiful foothill suburb of Los An
geles, and It brought Into the young
girl's life an experience such as seldom
comes to human beings â an experience
which may cause the loss of her rea
son.
Had her lover died Immediately after
firing the fatal shot It would have been
bad enough, but she was alone in the
house at the time, half a mile from the
nearest neighbor, and for four long
hours she held the head of the dying
man in her lap, unable to summon as
sistance.
She was afraid to leave him because
she loved him and because of the fear
that she herself might be accused of
having shot him. She finally, hailed a
passing teamster by screaming for help
and sent him for assistance.
Then came another long waft, and
when a physician finally arrived Per
rln was beyond all human aid. Even
then the girl refused to leave his side,
and for two hours begged the doctor
to save him for her, but the case was
hopeless. When, Just at dark, the end
came, the young woman collapsed and
fears are entertained that the shock
may kill her, or, worse, dethrone her
reason.
Perrln was the son of well-to-do par
ents at Hlverside, and there two years
ago he met Rudencia Hewitt, then 17
years of age, and fell In love with her.
He was then 22 years of age and al
though he" proposed marriage, the girl
was sensible enough to know that she
was too young to marry and plainly
told him so. For two years he pressed
his suit, but she steadfastly refused te
marry, preferring to finish her educa
tion. Yesterday he came here from
Riverside, determined to get a final an
swer.
He went to the girl's home and was
welcomed by her parents and remained
there over night. To-day the couple
came to Los Angeles and shortly after
noon they returned to Hollywood to
find that the others of the family had
left home. While seated on the front
porch he asked the girl to marry him,
but she again told him to wait Then
he threatened to kill himself, but she
urged him not to be rash. He sent her
Into the house for a glass of water and
as she was approaching him on her re
turn, he drew a revolver and shot him
self through the head. She ran to
him, tried to do something for him,
but It was too late. Then began her
long wait for assistance, which ended
only a short time before he died.
