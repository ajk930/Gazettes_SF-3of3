NEW YORK, April 17â Rawley D.
Evans. whose sudden death at Hotel
Collingswood on Sunday night puzzled
physicians, died of cerebro-6pinal men
lOÃltlfl.
The case was the worst recently ob
served. Young Evans was ;an athlete
and in perfect health. ; Twenty-four
hour 6 after the first slight symptoms
were noticed he was dead.
He was feeling thoroughly well when,
on Saturday afternoon, he left the of
fice* of the Wells- Fargo Company, of
which his father. ' Colonel Dudley Ev
ans, is president, and went home to
dinner. After dinner he complained of
what was supposed to be an attack of
indigestion. On Sunday morning he
seemed to be all right, but he had an
attack of nausea in the forenoon. A
trained nurse living with the family
thought it was a bilious attack.
Dr. Cyrus J. Strong came in during
the afternoon to attend Rawley's
brother, who had hurt his hand. He
felt Rawley's pulse and found nothing
disturbing. When he called in the
evening Rawley was in coma. Death
came at 10 o'clock. /,
The autopsy to-day showed that so
much fluid had accumulated in the
brain covering that all the symptoms
of a cerebral hemorrhage had been pro
duced.

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 3905.
Corroborates 1 es
timony of David
Belasco.
NEW YORK. April 17.â Mrs. Leslie
I Carter, the actress, was a witness tv-
I day in the case of David Belasco, the
! playwright, against Klav & Erlanger.
j Mrs. Carter was called by Samuel Un
termeyer, counsel for Belasco, to testify
regarding a meeting between Belasco
I and Nixon & Zimmerman, theatrical
managers of Philadelphia, at which
j she was present. Belasco had testified
i regarding this meeting when he was on
| the stand last week soon after the
I opening of the tria] of the suit, in which
| he seeks to Drove that Klaw & Er
; langer were his partners in the produc-
I tion of 'The Auctioneer" with David
; Warfield. Mrs. Carter's testimony to
j day corroborated that of Belasco re
j garding the Philadelphia meeting.
"Mr. Belasco told Mr. Nixon," said
, Mrs. Carter, "that he had been obliged
\ to give Erlanger 50 per cent of War
; field's profits. 'Why,' said Mr. Nixon, I
! did not know that.' And then Mr. Nix
| on said that his time would come, when
|he (Nixon) could bring Erlanger to
i terms for double-dealing."
Abraham Gruber, counsel for Klaw
â  & Erlanger, objected, but was over
â  ruled.
MXON USES PKOFAXE WORD.
"Did you know Mr. Brooks at that
time?" asked Untermeyer.
"Yes, but his name was not men-
I tioned. Mr. Nixon said he wanted Mr.
| Belasco to keep away from the theater,
I for he wanted to get 'Zaza' opened, and
j they were trying to serve papers on
him."
"Did he use a profane word?"
"Yes," replied Mrs. Carter. "Mr. Nix
on said there would be" â she paused
a second and smiled â 'hell to pay.' "
"Have you ever talked to anybody
about this case?"
"I certainly have. It has been on my
mind for a year and I have talked to
everybody about it."
"What did you tell Mr. Vidaver of
counsel?"
"I told him what I knew, and that Is
what I am going to testify to."
"What did you say you were going to
testify?"
"Just as I have told you."
"Won't you please tell it again?"
asked Mr. Gruber. "I love to hear you
talk."
"Thank you," said Mrs. Carter, "it
is so kind of you. I told Mr. Vidaver
that they weretrying to do Mr. Belasco
out of all his money and of how they
tried to get 'Zaza' away from him."
"No, I mean what you told him you
were going to testify as to the Nixon
interview."
"I am trying to tell you." said Mrs.
Carter. "I told Mr- Vidaver just what
I have told you.
"Mr. Nixon said they (Klaw & Er
langer) had tried to jump Belasco
from one part of the globe to another;
that they were trying to make him
spend his money; that they were
afraid of him with money, and were
afraid of him anyway. Nixon said he
had none of the money and he was
going to call Klaw & Krlanger to ac
count for their actions."
"You are friendly to Mr. Belasco, are
you not?"
"Not only friendly." replied Mrs.
Carter, "but thankfulâ grateful from
the bottom of my heart."
KLAW TAKES THE STAND.
Marc Klaw, a member of the firm of
Klaw & Erlanger, was a witness at
to-day's session of the court. Kiaw
produced some check stubs at the re
quest at Untermeyer, but several which
were wanted in connection with the
case were missing. The witness prom
ised to produce them. Untermeyer de
clared that subpenas served on Klaw
& Erlanger have been repeatedly dis
obeyed by them.
"We are going to get at the bottom
â¢w W Â«***- iv set ai LXJC UOILOIH
of these books, and we will show you
how they are kept before we get
through," he said. ,
Klaw said ; his firm cleared ; $20,000 on
"The Auctioneer" and also received its
share of 1 the profits from < the theaters
where ; ..; the / ; play was produced. : : His
firm, ; however, never was a partner in
"The Auctioneer," ;he â ' declared, except
through 1 ? Joseph Brooks, and It was
from Brooks that Klaw.& Erlanger re
ceived; the $20,000. r^; ; â¢/.-> â ;â  ; '!^--j;:::z:w ',
"You y paid Z Franklin > Bein ; a check
when â  you were \ trying to stop - Belasco
from producing 'The Music Master'?"
asked Untermeyer. r - , ; ;
A "If we did, we â  paid ,it for Brooks,"
the witness r replied. ;
" Hermann 'P.">t Aaron, bookkeeper for
Klaw & Erlanger for seven years, said
there was no account r-in ; : a certain ,
ledger which was produced i except â  with
Klaw & Erlanger- One page was writ
ten V '.'David Warfleld ; Company." The
bookkeeper testified that v all ? the ex
penses **- of T "The Auctioneer" ; were i
charged to the expense account of
Klaw & Erlanger.

Hayman.; .Walker ' did ; not : respond, and '
the attorney handed up a subpena r and
body attachment. j :' ''â .-': ~ , : |

FORGERY AND THREATS TO KILL
Charles A. Baxter Asserts That Dr. H. T.
Thornbursrh Abducted His Wife.
Wronged Husband
in Angry Frame
of Mind
â¦
v Charles A. Baxter, manager of the
Globe; Medical Dispensary Company,
â¢11 9- Market street, yesterday went be
ore ; a â¢ magistrate ; and .â . â  formally
charged Dr. Herbert T. Thornburgh,
formerly consulting physician of the
company, with the abduction of Mrs.
Baxter.
Buxter, accompanied by his pretty
v.ife. went before Police Judge Mogan
ysterday morning and swore out two
warrants for the arrest of Thorn
burgh, one charging him with threats
against hm, the ot,her with forgery.
Baxter and his wife reside at 1434
Buchanan street, and Thornburgh had
lived with them. They have a beauti-
ful little rl'at, handsomely furnished,
all the appointments denoting elegance
and taste.
For nine years Baxter and his wife
j have enjoyed unalloyed bliss, and
they had been the happiest of couples,
says Baxter, until Thornburgh came
between th^m. ami. as is charged, at
tempted to wreck their home.
Thornburgh, t-ays Baxter, first at
tempted to win the love of Mrs. Bax
ter l>y blandishments. Failing in this
he is said to have attempted to make
her husband Lelieve she was false to
him. Not succeeding in accomplish
ing his purpose he is accused of hav
ing resorted to chloroforming her and
of having sutceeded in abducting her
from her home and carrying her away
to San Jose.
Mrs. Baxter is said to have returned
to her husband of her own accord,
and is now with him in their flat.
BAXTER KM RAGED.
Although Baxter has sworn out
warrants for the arrest of Thornburgh
the. warrants -would never need to be
put into execution should the injured
husband, in his present enraged state
of mind, happen to meet the man he
accuses of having wronged him.
Baxter made the following state
ment of the affair:
"To protect my wife and myself
from the threats Of violence made
against us by Dr. Thornburgh I was
forced to take steps to have a war
rant issued for his arrest.
"He abducted my wife and caused
her to go away with him by threats
made to her that unless she went with
him he would kill her. For some time
he has been pouring into her ears the
statements that 1 was not true to her.
He has been continually telling her
alleged stories of my infidelity. At the
same time he was telling her of his
great love for her and coaxins her to
run away with him. I knew nothing
of all this at the time it was haDDen
ing.
"Last Thursday night when I came
home I noticed a scratch on my wife's
nose. When I asked her how It came
there, she said that when she was fix
ing up her face, her finger slipped and
dug out a piece of the flesh.
"I was not satisfied with the explana
tion, and after further questioning she
told me of the assault that Dr. Thorn
burgh had made on her. She said he
came into her room and tried to make
love to her. and that she indienantly
repulsed him. He then left the house.
Shortly afterward he came back and
rushed into her room with a towel
saturated with chloroform. He threw
thia ever her face, whereupon she
screamed and fought, but the chloro-
I form caused her to lose consciousness.
When she recovered she found the doc
tor fanning her face. He had opened
all the windows to let out the odor of
the anesthetic. She t was in a ieartui
state of excitement. , Â* 7 ; .

tion,for the most part in a strong pro-
Japanese tone. "
The Morning Post takes the milder
view that Damrank Bay is a mere
fishing port and unable to provide coal
or other supplies to the Russian squad
ron, which probably took shelter there
to replenish from its own colliers, and
that, though a technical breach of neu
trality had been committed, the French
authorities could hardly be held re
gponslble unless it could be proved that
they, had previous knowledge of Ro
jestvensky's intentions.

WILL PROTEST TO FRANCE.
Japanese Government Alleges Grave
Breach of Neutrality.
TOKIO, April 17.â 1t is calculated
here that the Russian squadron ar
rived at Kamranh Bay at noon on
April 12, and, therefore, had been oc
cupying the port forty-eight hour;?
when seen at noon on April 14.
Confirmation regarding vessels o/
the Russian squadron having been
seen at Kamranh Bay on April 14
reached Tokio to-day, and was given
to the public through a brief commu
nication from the Navy Department.
The news caused surprise, because it
was generally doubted that France
would permit the use of her ports to
a belligerent squadron engaged in of
fensive operations. The Japanes;
Government is silent on the subject of
its intentions, but it is expected that it
will make immediate representations
to France. The response of France 13
eagerly awaited, particularly as to
whether France admits that the
squadron is within territorial waters.
France denied that the Russian squad
ron was within territorial waters when
off Madagascar. If she denies it in this
instance, it will give Japan an oppor
tunity to attack the Russian vessels
without violating France's neutrality.
Many persons continue to believe the
Russian squadron will speedily leave
Kamranh Bay and continue its voy
age northward.
LESS BITTER TOWARD AMERICA.
Marked Change In Tone of Seml-Ofll-

ST. PETERSBURG, April 17.â A
marktd change in tone toward the
United States is noticeable in these
newspapers which usually voice the
opinions of the Government, many of
which dwell upon the manifestations
of a friendly disposition in Washing
ton.
The Novoe Vremya. discussing the
question of foreign sympathy, remarks
upon the distinction between the at
titude of governments and peoples, the
French masses, for example, earnest ly
desiring a Russian victory, while the
French financiers are doing everything
possible to bring about the conclusion
of peace. In the United States, the
paper adds, the people appear to be
hostile, but the Gc-vernment is friendly.
NOT HURRYING NORTHWARD.
Rojeptvcnsky's* Rendezvous Is in or

PARIS. April 17. â The dispatch
from Saigon announcing the presence
of Russian warships at Kamranh Bay
is considered ag showing that Admi
ral Rojestvensky is not moving north
ward as fast as fltes expected.
The fact that Admiral de Jori
quieres. the French naval commander
at Saigon, Is proceeding to Ka.mna.nh
Bay, and the departure from Saigon
last night of a vessel having on board
a cargo of Russian stores, combine to
indicate that the Russian rendezvous
is not far distant from Saigon, and
that probably It Is in or near Kam

quitted 1 of the charges preferred
against him by the naval court-martial
which tried him here.

SHOWS BIG DECREASE
Last Decade Shows a Falling Off of
Five in Every Thousand of
Population.
CHICAGO. April 17. â In closing his
ten years of service as Commissioner
of Health for the city of Chicago Dr.
Arthur R. Reynolds presents in his
annual report significant data show
ing the decrease of the death rate in
the city.
During the ten years from 1885 to
1694. inclusive, the yearly average
rate of death was 20.02 in every 1000
of population. During the succeeding
ten years the rate decreased to 15.1
in every 1Â«00 of population. This
means that there were 96,034 fewer
deaths during the last decade than
there would have been if the death
rate had not fallen below that of the
preceding ten years.

DISCUSSION
OF JAPANESE
PEACE TEEMS
Siberia's Conquest
Is Being Urged
in Tokio.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOKIO, April 17.â "Keep quiet,
gentlemen," was the Japanese Gov
ernment's entreaty to the press and
public at the opening of the war. So
both press and public preserved
silence. But suddenly of late, very
likely encouraged by the developments
in Russia and Manchuria, and per
haps from a fear that the Govern
ment would be overmoderate. public
and press have grown bolder in dis
cussing Japan's final demands upon
Russia.
Dr. Tomizu, professor at the Im
perial University, has been regarded
aÂ« the leader of the stalwarts.
"I am haunted by a fear that,
through the timidity of the men in
power and the advisers of the throne,
Japan may lose her opportunity and
let Russia- off too cheaply," he de
clares.
He makes six main points in his
arguments:
1. All nations are now guided by a
policy of land-grabbing, and Japan
cannot afford to be behind in the
scramble for territory.
2. Commercial expansion has be
comÂ£ impossible without territorial
expansion. Everywhere markets are
being closed by customs barriers.
Even the United States has caught the
imperialist fever and is looking for a
foothold on the Asiatic continent.
3. Now or never is Japan's oppor
tunity for territorial aggrandizement.
It would be impossible for Japan to
keep up with the other land-grabbing
nations; hence it is necessary at the
present time to sieze as much as pos
sible.
4. Trade cannot last unless backed
b- military force. If Japan does not
seize half of Russia's Asiatic posses
sions she will one day rue it sorely.
5. The professor explains how all
Siberia east of Lake Baikal should be
conquered and held by Japan. The
army Â»s to advance to Harbin and
stay there astride Russian communica
tions until Vladivostok is starved out
and the Russians are forced to with
draw beyond the lake. Then, firmly
established in the mountains south
of that great body of water, a handful
of Japanese could keep off the legions
of Russia forever.
â¢6. Liaotang peninsula, of course,
must remain Japanese. With regard
to Manchuria, the professor has some
scruples. It might be wise to return
it to China, nominally, but the juris
diction ought to belong to Japan.
Korea is to be annexed outright.

about a State-street cable car on
which James Jackson and Moses
Flood, two colored men, who had
driven a wagon to Montgomery Ward

a twinkling every window in the car
was smashed. Two policemen rushed
into the car and in order to protect
the colored men placed them under ar

SANTA FE STRIKERS' PLANS.
Blacksinltlis and Car Repairers May
Be Called Out.
TOPEKA, April 17. â J. D. Bucka
lew, third vice president of the Inter
national Association of Machinists,
who is one of the leaders in charge of
and directing the strike of the union
machinists against the Santa Fe Rail
road, is in Topeka. He claims that
the machinists have spent upward of
$350,000 in the strike against the
Santa Fe during the past year.
The announcement is made at the
strike headquarters that unless the
demands of the machinists and the
boilermakers be adjusted at once a
strike of the blacksmiths will be called
and if that does not bring the com
pany to the terms proposed by the
strikers the car repairers will be
called out.
GERMANY MAY DENOUNCE
TREATY WITH AMERICA
Reported That the Most Favored Na-
tion Part Will Be Cast
Aside.
BERLIN, April 17. â The Deutsche
Tages Zeitung, the organ of the
Agrarians, which has been demanding
that the Government terminate the
most, favored nation treaty with the
United States, says to-day without
reservation that the treaty soon will be
denounced. Efforts made by the press
to obtain a declaration from the Chan
cellor or some member of the Cabinet
on the subject have been met by re
plies that the Government was not yet
ready to say anything regarding the
United States and the trade conditions
created by the new commercial
treaties between Germany and the six
continental states.
The impression is that Germany
wishes to avoid trade hostilities and
that nx> steD is in immediate prospect
to exclude the United States from the
most favored nation treatment.
SQUADRON TO BE- SENT
FOR PAUL JONES' BODY
Some Doubt Exists, However, as to
Whether Naval Hero's Grave
Has Been Found.
WASHINGTON, April 17. â It is
authoritatively announced that, when
the proper time comes, the United
States Government will send a splen
did squadron to France to bring to
the United States for interment with
military honors the body of John Paul
Jones the great revolutionary naval
commander, which Embassador Por
ter reports he has found.
The wealth of circumstantiality
surrounding the find rather shakes
than increases the confidence of some
persons that this is really the body of
John Paul Jones. So long had his
resting place remained a question of
doubt that many gave up the hope of
ever locating it and there is not now,
so far as learned here, anything real
ly conclusive and beyond question in
proof of the identity of the body.

BENSON MUST
STAND TRIAL
WASHINGTON, April 17.â The Su
preme Court of the United States to-day
through an opinion by Justice Brown
affirmed the decision of the New York
Federal Court, refusing to grant a pe
tition for a writ of habeas corpus in the
case of John A. Benson, who is resist
ing removal to the District of Colum
bia for trial on the charge of con
spiracy to defraud the Government in
connection with land frauds on the
Pacific Coast.
The special charge in this case, on
which Benson was indicted by the
Grand Jury of the District of Colum
bia, was that of bribing an officer of
the Interior Department to reveal to
him the purport of a report to the de
partment. He was arrested in New
York and sought to prevent removal
to this city by means, of a writ of
habeas corpus, which was denied by
the Circuit Court of the United States
for the southern district of New York.
There were three points raised in the
case as follows: First â That the indict
ment charges no crime against the
United States; second, that the Dis
trict of Columbia is not a district of
the United States within the meaning
of the law, and third, that the crime
was committed in California and is
only triable there.
All these points were overruled. Com
menting on the suggestion that the
District of Columbia is not a judicial
district, Justice Brown said in his writ
ten opinion:
"It may be said that any construc
tion of the law which would preclude
the extradition to the District of Co
lumbia of offenders arrested elsewhere
would be attended by such abhorrent
consequences that nothing but the
clearest language would authc-rize such
construction." He added informally:
"The constitution follows the flag in
the District of Columbia."
BEER LAW UPHELD.
Supreme Court Passe* on Missouri
Inspection Statute.
WASHINGTON, April 17.â The Su
preme Court of the United States to
day affirmed the decision of the Circuit
Court for the Eastern District of Mis
souri in the case of Pabst vs. Crenshaw,
attacking the validity of the beer in
spection law of the State of Missouri.
The effect of this decision is to sustain
the law as not antagonistic to the com
merce clause of the constitution. The
opinion was delivered by Justice White.
The Chief Justice and Justices Brewer.
Brown and Day united in a dissenting
opinion.
In this case the Pabst Brewing Com
pany, a Wisconsin corporation, filed a
bill in the United States Circuit Court
for the Western District of Missouri to
enjoin Crenshaw. as State beer inspect
or, from collecting an inspection charge
imposed by a State law on malt liquors
shipped from other States. The law
was attacked as repugnant to the in
terstate provision of the national con
stitution, but Justice White said:
"As the Supreme Court of Missouri
has determined that the statute does
not conflict with the State constitution
and is valid because it is a police regu
lation imposing conditions upon the
business of manufacturing and selling
beer in Missouri, a traffic which it is
conceded the State had the power to
prohibit entirely, it follows that we are
without power, from a consideration of
the State constitution, to treat the law
as invalid because of the revenue pro
visions of the State constitution or
other limitations imposed by that con
stitution upon the State government."
BANK LAW INVALID.
Supreme Court Throws Out Taxation
Statute of Kentucky.
WASHINGTON. April 17. â The Su
preme Court of the United States to
day affirmed the decision of the
United States Circuit Court for the
eastern district of Kentucky in the
case of the city of Covington vs. the
National Bank of Covington, holding
to be invalid the Kentucky law re
quiring national banks of that State
to make return of all shares for tax
ation purposes. The opinion was by
Justice Day, and was based on the
ground of discrimination against na
tional banks.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 17.â An
imperial rescript issued to-day orders
Count Kutaiszoff, Governor of Irkutsk,
to elaborate a scheme for the introduc

"L'p to a, short time before he passed
away he was seemingly in his usual

that members of the family heard a

baste was made to get a physician
from Redwood City, but death was al
most Immediate.
Nothing could have been more unex

business as late as last Friday. He and
hie family had just moved to the coun

ly remained away from the city Satur

shocked the legal fraternity, the mem

belonged and a wide circle of personal
friends.
The funeral will take place to-day.
Pervices, for the family only, will be
held at Portola Hall at 1 p. m. The
Interment will be at Cypress Lawn.

his excellent judgment served to amass
for him a fortune. He was prominently
connected with the Selby Lead and
Smelting Company as a member of the
executive committee of the board of di
rectors. He was also identified with
banks as a director and he had other
business interests of importance.
At the time that the people of San
Francisco came together to build the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad through the San Joaquin Val
ley he was attorney for the new cor
poration, with which he also was coun
sel and director for some years.
With his various business and legal
engagements Colonel Preston still
found time to distinguish himself in
other directions. He was at one time
president of the Country Club, and
was a member of the Pacific-Union
Club, the Union League Club, the Bo
hemian Club, the San Francisco Club
and the Olympic Club. He was also a
member of the California Bar Associa
tion, a Knight Templar and actively
identified with the Masonic order in
an official capacity.
He shone in society, in the legal
profession. In the clubs, in business,
in political and in fraternal circles.
FOND OF THE COUNTRY.
Colonel Preston was particualrly
fond of out-of-door pursuits as a hunt
er and fisherman, and of all manly
athletic exercises. He seemed to be
the picture of health, his complexion
being continually bronzed by the sun
and wind. In his fifty-seventh year he
was more active than many a younger
man.
He was an ardent Republican in
politics. It was characteristic of him
that, when he failed to get the nom
ination for Governor of California, he
made political speeches for his politi
cal rival. Perhaps that was as good a
key to his character as any, for it il
lustrated at once his loyalty and gen
erosity. He was always fair, always
courteous. As an orator he was known
widely.
Members of the Preston family
came to America in 1635, and settled
in Virginia. In Colonial times the
Prestons took part in stirring events.
Colonel Preston was proud of his an
cestors.
He was twice married. Five chil
dren survive â Mrs. L. D. Owens, Ran
dolph Preston, Mrs. Worthington
Ames. Mrs. Willard Drown and Frank
Preston. Frank is a student at Co
lumbia College in New York.
Some of Colonel Preston's children,
Mrs. Preston and his grandchildren
were with him at the time of his
death, having gone down with him to
spend some time in the country.
Appropriate action will be t::ken by
the several clubs, the Masonic order
and other organizations, of which
Colonel Preston was a member, to
voice their respect to his memory as a
good citizen, a genial companion, a
true friend, a man of honor and prob
ity, whose life was one of usefulness,
crowned with prizes that justly befel
to qualities that were in all regards
admirable.
When Judge Kerrigan's court ad
journed yesterday afternoon the Judge
ordered that it be entered on the min
utes that the court, would adjeurn un
til Wednesday out of respect to the
memory of the late E. F. Preston.

NEW YORK April 17.â T0 dis- !
cuss and take action on the un- !
settled condition of the Equitable
Life Assurance Society's affairs, 180
general agents and district managers
of the society held a caucus behind
closed doors in the Hotel Netherlands
to-night and adopted a resolution in
dorsing President J. W. Alexander of !
the society, but containing an emphatic
request that the present factional strife
cease. There are approximately 220
agents here to-night, but the forty
Equitable representatives who did not
attend the meeting took no definite ac
tion so far as could be learned. Every
representative who attended to-night's
meeting was pledged to abide by the
decision reached. Gage Tarbell, second
vice president of the society; H. H.
Knowles, superintendent of agencies,
and President Alexander's secretary,
Pendreigh, were at the meeting.
E. A. Woods, general agent of the
society in Pittsburg, directed the move
ment which led to the caucus. He ex
plained afterward that it was desired
to outline some definite form of action
so that Tuesday's general meeting of
agents could be expedited.
President Alexander and Vice Presi
dents Hyde and Tarbell will attend to
morrow's meeting. It is understood
that Alexander, Hyde and Tarbell will
be given opportunity to make any
statements they desire.

ALBANY, N. V., 17.â Francis
Hendricks, State Superintendent of In
surance, to-day was served with a copy
of the order issued by Justice Scott of
the Supreme Court on the application
of Herbert G. Tull, a policy holder in
the Equitable Life Assurance Society,
requiring the Superintendent to show
cause why he should not be restrained
from taking action on the amended
charter of the society, which has been
submitted to him by the board of direc
tors for approval. The order is also di
rected against the board of directors.
It is returnable on Tuesday morning in
New York City. Superintendent Hen
dricks has requested Attorney General
Mayer to represent him on the return
of the order and a representative of
the Attorney General's department will
be present at the hearing.
NO LEGISLATIVE INQUIRY.
Governor Higgins was asked to-night
if there were any developments that
suggested the expediency of a legisla
tive investigation of the affairs of the
Equitable Society. He replied:
"I have not yet heard of anything
which has convinced me that a legisla
tive investigation of this insurance
company at this time would be of any
value"
The Governor repeated his belief that
the investigation which is being con
ducted by the State Department of In
surance will be entirely satisfactory.
Speaking of the various matters con
cerning this company's management,
reports of which have appeared in pub
lic print, the Governor said:
"All those matters are to be investi
gated in a proper manner and they will
be sifted to the bottom."
He also said that if there had been
any violations of law in the manage
ment of the company he believed that
â¢the offenders could be proceeded
against under the general laws.

BOSTON, April 17.â Rev. C. A. Crane,
pastor of the People's Temple, violently
denounced at a meeting to-day the ac
ceptance of the Rockefeller gifts by the
American and Baptist mission boards,
calling it "dollarhood rampant." Said
he:
I pray the curse of Almighty God to rest
upon the unholy alliance of robbery and mis
taken Christianity. And It will come whether
or not I may pray for It. May he hasten the
day of lta coming.
Dollarhood rampant and manhood crouching
would be an appropriate coat of arms for some
branches of the church militant just now.
We are told by preachers who cannot bear
the Rockefeller criticisms that he Is a very
good man. If he is he is very unfortunate In
securing the reputation of being the most suc
cessful squeezer of the poor, the most exalted
robber of railroads and the most eminent mur
derer of competition the world has ever
known. Even the dreams of Alexander Dumas

Rockefeller.
NEW YORK, April 17.â "There is a

That is $5 10 in our money. Do you

Every man who takes money from his
neighbor without equivalent is betray
ing his master," declared Rev. Dr.
George F. Pentecost in a sermon at the
Madison-avenue Baptist Church, on
the subject of so-called "Tainted
Money." He continued:
Some people ask why need we inquire into
the color of money, whether it be clean or
dirty, bo long as it be given to God, for the
altar sanctifies the gift.
I do not hesitate to say this Is the most
Immoral doctrine I ever heard. We must look
at the whole question. There is more In the
Bible about money than regeneration or for
giveness. We must ask how God has told us
to get money and to use money.
The richest man in the world. Dr.
Pentecost declared, had been said to
hold from five hundred to one thou

He 'has given In charity $28,500,000 - during
his life and some people hail;- him, therefore,
as one of the greatest : benefactors of j modern

NEW YORK, April 17.â Secretary
Taft and members of the Panama Ca
qal Commission were in session to-day
at the offices of the Panama Railroad
Company. The following new board of
directors was elected: Theodore P.
Shonts, J. F. Wallace, Charles E. Ma

Hams, B. M. Harrod, O. R. Ernest,
William N. Cromwell, William B. Par
sons, Clarence R. Edwards, J. R. Obal
dla, R. L. Farnham and Edward A.
Drake. Shonts was elected to the pres
idency of the reorganized company.
The board ordered the double-track-
ing and re-equipping of the railroad
and made an appropriation of $1,270,
000 for that purpose. The directors and
officers of the company held a pro
tracted session, after which President
Shonts made an informal statement.
The directors adopted a resolution to
the effect that the president, vice pres
ident and general manager of the rail
road shall draw no salaries except j
the/so to which they are entitled as of- I
fleers of the commission. The direc- J
; tors will draw no fees for attending j
meetings of the board. All traveling j
expenses incurred in connection with J
the work of the commission or rail- j
road company will be paid. Before â 
leaving for Washington Secretary Taft
said:
"With Mr. Shonts at the head of the
j Panama Railroad Company it is cer
| tain that its affairs will be conducted
most satisfactorily. His experience as j
a practical railroad man will enable |
; him to operate this railroad just as
; the Panama commission may desire
while the work of construction is in
progress. I expect that the canal com
mission will have concluded their in
vestigation of conditions and we will
be able to report our plans and recom
mendations to Congress in December.
It is the intention of the administra
tion to have appointed at an early date
a beard of consulting engineers, which
will assist in this work. We desire to
have on board a representative
from Germany, France and England
and with this end in view three na
; tions will be urged to appoint one rep
; resentative each.
"It is the intention of the Govern
' ment to cause to be built a new line of
I steamships to add to those of the Pan
j ama Steamship Co-mpany so as to give
; a five days' service."
In regard to the canal he said he be
lieved between $50,000,000 and $75,000,000
would have to be added to the old esti
mate.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, April 17.â J. W. Landom
of North Yakima reported to the police
this afternoon that he had been robbed
of $1735 in a restaurant. Landom says
he got off the train at the Union de
pot and started up town. He stopped
at the first restaurant he came to to get
a lunch. He had been seated only a
minute or two when a well-dressed
stranger took a seat next to him at
the table. The newcomer dropped a
napkin and in reaching for it brushed
his shoulder against the victim, for
which he apologized, and soon after
took his departure.
When Landom got up to pay his bill,
he says, he found he had "been

lite but awkward stranger.

Strike of the Railway Men
Not a Complete Success,
as Many Refuse to Join
ROME, April 17. â The strike of the
railroad men, which was begun to
day, was not as successful as expected.
Some of the men refused to strike,
and published a manifesto saying they
could not risk the bread of their fam
ilies. With these men and a military
escort one train left Rome on each
line. A car on each train was con
verted into a prison for use if arrests
are necessary during the journey. Not
withstanding the uncertainty of such
traveling many Americans left this
city for Naples, Florence and Pisa.
The leaders of the movement are
trying to bring about a general strike
of all workmen, but they' find little
sympathy. If it occurs, the Govern
ment has decided to intrust the mili
tary authorities with the maintenance
of order.
Five men-of-war have been ordered
to Genoa to maintain order.
The strike is a protest against the
new bill presented by the Fortis Cabi
net, because it provides for the dis
missal of those who go on strike and
does not contain an arbitration clause.
The leaders of the railroad men will
urge a general strike of all workmen
if the Government has recourse to re
pressive measures or applies the
clauses of the railroad bill providing
for the punishment of railroad strik
ers. The railroad men who refused to
strike are fed and housed at the sta
tions, so as to prevent their coming
, in contact with the strikers.

WOMAN MUST
DIE FOR CRIME
Pennsylvania Supreme Court
Approves the Sentence
Imposed Upon Murderess
PHILADELPHIA, April 17.â 8y a
vote of five to two the Supreme Court
to-day decided that Mrs. Catherine
Danz must hang for the murder of her
husband, William G. Danz. George P.
Hossey, a colored voodoo doctor, has
also received the death sentence for the
part he took in the murder of Danz.
Danz died under peculiar circum
stances, and a post mortem examina
tion of the remains revealed the fact
that he died of arsenic poisoning. Both
Mrs. Danz and Hossey were arrested
and charged with the murder of Danz.
The woman testified that she had
bought powders from Hossey and ad
ministered them to her husband for the
purpose of curing the drink habit. She
claimed not to have known the contents
of the powders. Hossey was first placed
on trial and convicted of having sold
powders containing arsenic, which, the
prosecution alleged, killed Danz.
At the conclusion of Hossey's trial
Mrs. Danz was tried on the charge of
murder for having administered the
poisonous powders. She was also con
victed, and both were sentenced to be
hanged. An appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court by the woman's coun
sel, but to-day's decision leaves only
the pardon board between the woman
and the gallows.
A Keneral strike for more wages has
broken out on the largest sugar plan

LOEB TO VISIT
THE PRESIDENT
Secretary Must Make Long
Trip to Hunting (amp
With Important Papers
GLENWOOD SPRINGS. Colo.. April
17.â Before President Roosevelt pene
trates the wilds so far that communi
cation with the outside world will be
next to impossible Secretary Loeb, with
the aid of a courier daily expected from
the camp, will get on the President's
trail and visit him in the mountains.
The visit will be for the purpose of
taking up with the President a number
of important matters that have come
to the headquarters here since Saturday.
There are many commissions to bÂ«
signed, as well as much departmental
business that has been forwarded.
Wild stories of the hunt, most of
them obviously fakes, have reached
here. Secretary Loeb does not credit
them. Several of these stories have
been investigated, and it has been dis
covered that the talebearer could not
have received reliable information from
the President's camp, for he cuuld have
had no opportunity.
An Illustration of the dearth of au
! thentic news or picture material waÂ»
I noticed about a mile from the Hotel
j Colorado to-day. A photographer rep
resenting a syndicate selling pictures to
I daily newspapers attached a wire to
i the telegraph line running through a
wild section of the mountain country
and then attached a telegraph instru
; ment to the wire, using a stump of a
j tree as a table. An assistant then posed
I for a picture, which will be 9old to
I newspapers in alleged representation <>f
I the manner in which news is sent from
i the President's camp. As a matter of
j fact, there is no telegraphic wire within
miles of the original camp of the party.

"RED FEATHER" HAS GOOD
FLASHES OF MUSIC.
COMEDIANS ALSO WIN PRAISE
Brighter Than the
Severe Critics
Have Said.
De Koven Hand Has
Not Lost All Its
Cunning.
Those afflicted with the grand opera
ear would better keep away from the
Columbia for a day or two. De Ko
ven's latest, "Red Feather," Is there
and it be neither a "Fledermaus" nor
yet a "Robin Hood." Still, "Red Feath
er" is not co black as It has been paint
ed. We have had a ruck of operas
"comic" that "went" In spite of equal
witlessness and similar unworth. "Red
Feather" has the usual innocuous
Btory, set in the visionary town of Ro
mancia, Its plot is discernible if not
wildly dramatic; its music â in
the "Madrigal" and the nnale of the
first act â occasionally both skillful
and engaging; Its settings especially
handsome, and its representation by
the large cast of more than common
adequacy.
The "Madrigal" aforesaid, standing
out luminously from much that is
cheaply commonplace, shows that the
De Koven hand has not wholly lost its
cunning. It is as freshly, genuinely
musical as most of "Robin Hood." The
finale of the first act Is also distinctly
well made, and "The Humorus Ghost"
another bit of good writing. But the
breeze, the fine fire, has gone from the
rest. A "made-to-order" air hangs
about the thing. It lacks body, sponta
neity, invention and. above all. distinc
tion. In fact, the evidence Is abundant
that Mr. de Koven has not taken his
comic opera seriously, as in the old
days.
Mr. Charles Klein, who made the
bopk, is a courageous sort of person.
The libretto is a perfect cemetery for
dead jokes. Live ones there are, too, it
is granted, and fortunate in their deliv
ery by the trio of comedians. W. J.
McCarthy is a Deutscher baron after
the entertaining fashion of Louis Casa
vant, fat and wreathed in an irre
sistible smile as Colonel McPatrickâ a
Fortescue part as ever was. Myron P.
Davies is a comical little toothpick of
a person as Bagstock Bowler. The

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Alcazar.
"The Man From Mexico" drew a
large house at the Alcazar last night
and it is evident that it is in for a suc
i ssfttl run, the mirth it created
showing that it is still popular and
attesting the opinion of the audience
that it la well played. The versatility
Of the Alcazar is as remarkable as
that of some actors who seem able to
play any part successfully. The play
house puts on a range of productions
that would seem to bring it up against
a failure some time, but the public,
with a confidence born of long pat
ronage of the house and knowledge of
its ability to handle almost any piece
with the players it employs, never
fails In its attendance and it always
receives satisfaction. Those who want
to laugh will have their wish grati
fied by witnessing the troubles and di
lemmas <>f the man wno came from
Mexico without going there. John
Craig, who assumes the leading role,
makes a remarkable success in the
part and many wonder that one so
totally different from Willie Collier,
who, to some, is the only man from
Mexico, could be so funny in the part-
Mr. Craig has a way of his own of
playing the role that is in 6ome re
spects better than that of Mr. Collier
and in some not go good, but that
brings just as much laughter. The
Alcazar's is a sprightly, spick-and
span, up-to-date, well groomed com
pany of men and women, all clever,
and "The Man From Mexico" receives
the same capable treatment at their
hands as does all other plays essayed
by them.
Central.
Jim Corrlg^m vas never more in his
element than last nigrht at the Central,
where he and Henry Shumer had the
two leading parts in the hilariously
funny farce, "The Corner Grocery."
From his first appearance to the last
Corrig-an evoked a burst of cheers. He
was always funny, true to the charac
ter, both as to make-up and brogue,
and a better man could not have been
selected for the humorous Irishman.
Henry Shumer, usually cast as a
villain, played the German last night,
and it will be the mistake of this ver
satile actor's life if he does not give
up melodrama for straight comedy.
For finish, technique, articulation,
voice and appearance Mr. Shumer has
many a star outclassed, and besides
he is an actor who knows the value of
stage tricks. Myrtle Vane, too, as the
naughty boy, was In her element- She
has a dash and a qlquancy all of her
own. She never overdoes and com
bining this with a musical, sympathet
ic voice she justly deserves her pop

WANTS SAN FRANCISCO
TO OWX WATER PLANT
E. F. Cragin Suggests Plan for Pur-
chase of Existing Systems and
New Source of Supply.
Edward F. Cragin of New York
wants San Francisco to go into the
business of supplying its citizens with
water. Mr. Cragin, who has been in
the city for the last week or two, has
issued a statement in which he lays
â¢mphasia on the benefits of municipal
ownership, and concludes with the
suggestion that the city purchase the
water supply owned by himself and
associates near the head waters of
the south fork of the American River.
But this is but preliminary. A com
prehensive plan, Mr. Cragin says, is
to combine all wat'r properties within
seventy-five miles of this city, thereby
clearing the field of all antagonism
and lawsuit*, and giving the city im
mediate ownership of a "going" water
works system, together with perma
nent control of the Sierra's source of
supply.
Mr. Cragin contends that the pres
ent source of water supply will be in
adequate to meet the demands of the
steadily increasing population of this
city in a few years, and then the plant
in the Sierras could be brought into
use. His plan is to authorize the is
suance of $37,000,000 of bonds at SM
per cent, using about $35,000,000 for
the purchase of the aforementioned
properties and reserving the balance
for needed improvements.

HOT FIGHT
WAGED IN
THE PALACE
Zeb Kendall, Well-Known
Tonopah Man. Accuses Jim
Campbell of Treachery
and Then Strikes Him
BATTLE CONTINUES
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
Exciting Scene Outgrowth
of Recent Roulette (lame
in the Nevada Camp, When
.Miner Dropped a Fortune
The Palace Hotel was the scene of a
lively fight yesterday afternoon be
tween two well-known men of Tonopah,
and but for the fact that both were un
armed a fatality was probably averted.
Shortly after 2 o'clock "Zeb" Kendall,
one of the pioneers of the new mining
camp and who recently gained consid
erable prominence through his heavy
winnings and losses at a roulette wheel
in Tonopah, and Jim Campbell, also
from Tonopah, met seemingly in a
friendly way in the office of the hotel,
and a few minutes later they were seen
to enter the elevator on their way to
Kendall's room. They were accompa
nied by several friends, and little heed
would have been paid to the incident
had it not been followed ten minutes
later by the sudden reappearance of
Campbell in the hotel office. His face
was pale, his clothes badly mussed, his
coat sleeve torn and his heavy breath
ing plainly suggesting that he had just
emerged from a lively melee.
Hardly had Campbell hurriedly made
his exit from the hotel office when
Kendall and one of his intimate friends
walked out of the elevator and elanc
ing around the office, made their way
to the barroom.
Half an hour later a score or more
of Tonopah mining men were busily
discussing a fight that had occurred
in Kendalls room between himself and
Campbell and of how interference on
the part of H. Hofer, one of Nevada s
best known citteens, had prevented
serious results. The fact that Kendall
and Campbell had been seen in each
other's company a great deal of late
in Tonopah and had apparently been
good friends after their arrival here
naturally added interest to .the report
of their quarrel and kept the mining
men busily talking way into the night.
Kendall has been a prosperous miner
in Nevada since the early days of
Tonopah. He is known throughout the
mining camp&^s a generous fellow and
staking men fowvarious enterprises has
been a common everyday affair with
him. Ho is, however, an ardent gam
bler and has won and lost fortunes at
the roulette wheels of Tonopah. Re
cently he won two big stakes, one of
$10,000 and another of $12,000, and after
a rest he began again at the wheel. It
is claimed that he was drinking at the
time and called to his side Campbell, to
whom he intrusted his coin and notes
amounting to nearly $40,000. In the end
Kendall lost $35,000 in cash and hia
bunch of "I. O. U.s," some of which
â¢were given him by the proprietor of a
Tonopah hotel, whom he had helped
financially.
Kendall took his losses philosophi
cally, but later he was advised that
Campbell, who, it appears, is quite a
gambler, had not acted as his friend in
the game. Investigation on the part of
Kendall satisfied him that the stories
brought to him were true and he de
cided to have an accounting with
Campbell. The opportunity came yes
terday when the two met in the Palace.
With a view of avoiding a scene in the
office, Kendall conceived the idea of in
viting Campbell to his room and there
telling him what he thought of him.
The invitation was accepted and a few
minutes later found the two men in
Kendall's room. Then Kendall, who is
a giant in form and a fearless fellow,
suddenly confronted Campbell, who, by
the way, has never been accused of
cowardice, and charged him with
having played him false.
Campbell denied the accusation and
Kendall struck him in the face. There
upon Campbell grabbed a chair and
attempted to swing it upon his oppon
ent's head, but the latter proved too
agile, and grabbing the chair, wrested
it. from Campbell's hands. The fight
was then a running one, Campbell gal
loping around the room in search of
articles with which he might defend
himself, but was finally overtaken by
his angry opponent and the two men
clinched. It was at this stage of the
fight that Hofer, who was among those
who accompanied Kendall and Camp
bell to the room, interceded and finally
succeeded in separating them, giving
Campbell a chance to escape from the
room.
Last- night Kendall stubbornly re
fused to discuss any phase of his trou
bles with Campbell and remained
away from the hotel until a late hour.
Among the Tonopah miners, who
know Kendall well and speak highly
of him. it is believed that he and
Campbell may meet again and in that
event It is expected that shooting and
not fist fighting will be their mode of
warfare. Kendall's friends claim that
his recent losses In Tonopah were the
result of a plot of certain gamblers to
gain possession of the notes he held
against certain persons. It is said that
Kendall now shares this opinion, but
has told several of his friends that
having lost these notes at a gambling
game he does not propose to give
further thought to the matter.

TEN HOUR LAW
KNOCKED OUT
New York Statute Pertaining
to Employment in Bakeries
Is Held Unconstitutional
SUPREME COURT EULING
Decision Made on Grounds
That It Does Not Conform
to Fourteenth Amendment
WASHINGTON, April 17.â 1n an
opinion by Justice Peckham, the Su
preme court of the United States to
day h^ld to be unconstitutional the
New York State law making ten hours
a day's work and sixty hours a week's
work in bakeries in that State. Jus
tices Harlaai, White, Day and Holmes
dissented and Justice Harlan declared
that no more important decision had
been rendered in the last century.
The opinion was handed down in the
rase of Lofen vs. the State of New
York and was based on the ground
that the law interferes with the free
exercise of the rights of contract be
tween individuals. The Court of Ap
peals of the State upheld the law and
affirmed the judgment of the trial
court holding Lofen guilty. Judge
Parker wrote the opinion of the New
York Court of Appeals supporting the
law, and the court divided four to
three on the question of validity.
The law involved in the case Is sec
tion 110 of the New York State labor
law prescribing the hours of labor in
bakeries in the State. Lofen is a ba
ker in the city of Utica and was found
guilty of permitting an employe to
work in his bakery more than sixty
hours in a week and fined $50. The
judgment was affirmed by the New
York Appellate Court.
To-day's opinion dealt entirely with
the constitutional question Involved.
Justice Peckham said that the law is
not an act merely fixing the number of
hours which shall constitute a legal
day's work, but an absolute prohibition
upon the employer permitting under
any circumstances more than ten
hours' work to be done in his establish
ment. He continued:
"The employe may desire to earn the
extra money which would arise from
his working more than the prescribed
time, but this statute forbids the em
ployer from permitting the employed
to earn it. It necessarily interferes
â with the right of contract between'the
employer and employed concerning the
number of hours in which the latter
may labor In the bakery of the em
ployer. The general right to make a
contract in relation to his business is
part of the liberty of the Individual
protected by the fourteenth amend
ment to the Federal constitution. Un
der that provision no State can de
prive any person of life, liberty or
property without due process of law.
The right to purchase or to sell
labor is part of the liberty protected
by this amendment unless there are
circumstances which exclude the
right."
The Justice referred to the excep
tions coming under the head of the
police powers of the State, and, after
considering that point at length, con
cluded that the present case did not
fall within the police powers.
He quoted statistics to show that the
trade of a baker is not an especially
unhealthy one, and said men could not
be prevented from earning a living for 1
their families. He concluded:
"It seems to us that the real object
and purpose was simply to regulate
the hours of labor between the master
and his employes, all being men sui
juris, in a private business not dan
gerous in any degree to morals or in
any real and substantial degree to the
health of the employe. Under such cir
cumstances the freedom of master and
employe to contract with each other
in relation to their employment and In
denning the same cannot be prohibited
or interfered with without violating
the Federal constitution."

BROWN PUPILS
CAUSE' STRIKE
OMAHA, April 17. â The uncorking of
in onÂ© of the South Omaha schools thiÃ
morning led to a strike of some 400 or
500 children, who refused to enter the
school building as long as the Japa
nese were permitted to remain. During
the day the boys and girls paraded the
streets with banners, giving vent to
lusty yells in sympathy with the spirit
of the revolution.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The trouble dates back to the big
packing-house strike of last summer.
About the only strike-breakers who
have remained at the plants are a few
hundred Japanese. The packers con
sider the little brown men wonderful
workers. They say they never complain
and are punctual and steady as a
clock, working all day like pack horses.
The favor of the packers and the fact
that they are holding the places of
strikers have earned for the Japanese
the bitter hatred of other packing
house employes. A formal protest to
the School Board was unheeded, and
this morning the adverse sentiment
cropped out in violent form.
Two husky boys stationed themselves
early at the entrance to the school
building and insisted that not a pupil
should enter the school building until
they â¢were assured that the Japanese
would be kept away. As the children
arrived the crowd increased. The jeer
ing and hooting and jostling of the
boys and girls became alarming, caus
ing fear of injury to the little ones.
Miss Sadie Oliver, principal of the
school, finding herself unable to re
strain the youngsters, telephoned to the
police for assistance. Meantime the
parents began to arrive on the scene
and added their voices to the demand
for the removal of the obnoxious Japa
nese. Not until 11 o'clock was quiet
finally restored, and for hours after
ward the children marched through the
streets crying, "No Japs for us."
There are about 300 Japanese em
ployed at the packing-houses, mostly
at Cudahy's. A large colony of them
are herded together in a building
formerly occupied by the Good Shep
herd Home, and another body is domi
ciled In Cudahy's chicken-house. They
draw small wages, spend most of their
money here and gamble extensively
among themselves. Several times the
police have been called upon to quell
riots in their clubhouse.

Customs Inspectors and the
Immigration Bureau Cross
Wires in a Zealous Hunt
OFFICERS ARE FOILED
Passenger's Story Confirms
the Belief That Smug
gled Opium Was Landed
What has become of a cargo of Chi
nese and opium expected here on the
schooner Rainier, which arrived here
from Bellingham yesterday?
It is believed that the smuggled
opium was landed somewhere on the
coast between this port and Port
Townsend, but there is nothing to in
dicate that there had been Chinese on
board.
According to a passenger on the
Rainier, a launch steamed up to the
Rainier one night and shortly after
disappeared.
The Immigration Bureau and the lo
cal customs office was busy, very busy,
yesterday. All Sunday night a launch
with two immigration men lay out on
the Potato Patch waiting for the
Rainier and her supposed contraband
Asiatics. The Rainier hove to and was
boarded. There were no Chinese on
board.
As soon as the purported smuggler
dropped her mudhook in the harbor ten
customs officers swarmed over her
sides. They searched her for opium,
bui found none.
Both the customs office and the^lm
migration Bureau are puzzled over the
affair Customs Inspector Ide of Port
Townsend had telegraphed that he had
positive information that a steam
schooner laden with Chinese and opium
was bound for San Francisco. The
statement of the passenger lends cor
roboration.
Neither office took the other into Its
confidence. The Immigration Bureau
wanted to capture the Asiatics single
handed and the customs office wanted
the honor of seizing the opium all to
itself. Both were disappointed.
For some time weird theories as to
the disappearance of the cargo were
suggested. It is suggested that the
combination of "heathen Chinee" and
opium might have caused spontaneous
combustion of the cargo, or that the
example of the old slavers might have
been followed.
The Rainier brought a cargo of lum
ber, the unloading of which is still be
ing watched by customs inspectors.
Though the Immigration Bureau is cer
tain that there are no Chinese dis
guised among the planks the customs
office is going to make sure that no un
taxed opium gets in.

TONOPAH STAYS
DREAD DISEASE
Epidemic in Which Many
Were Carried Off in Past
Thirty Days Now Abating
CAMP 18 DISINFECTED
Citizens' Committee Takes
the Matter in Hand and
Success Crowns* Efforts
Â»Â» â ~-
Emil Sutro of Sutro & Co., mining
brokers In Tonopah, arrived in this
city yesterday from the new camp and
says the disease that has caused many
deaths recently in the district has
abated and that all fear is past. The
epidemic, according to medical ex
perts, resulted from germs that were
conveyed from decayed vegetable mat
ter to the food and water. Within the
past few days, and since the citizens
of the place organized for the pur
pose of disinfecting the camp, there
have been no deaths, and measures for
eradicating the disease will be con
tinued.
"The citizens of Tonopah organized
last Thursday night," said Sutro, "and
$1900 was soon collected for the pur
pose of cleaning up the camp. The
town was, divided Into six sections and
a squad of four men placed in each
section to do the work. The citizens
of the place gave every assistance to
the committee and each night a large
quantity of garbage was destroyed by
fire. Wells, Fargo & Co. transported
a carload of disinfectants into the
camp free of charge and great prog
ress was made. It was agreed that
after cleaning the town thoroughly a
sewer system should be Installed, and
capital for that object has already
been promised.
"The disease, to which about thirty
succumbed between March 15 and
April 15, Is a form of pneumonia and
seems to attack every organ of the
body. It results in a great extent from
carelessness and exposure. People
have been warned not to drink any
water from barrels used by horses and
cold storage meats have been pre
scribed. The period of alarm has
passed and the camp will be booming
within three months."
J. C. Ralston, the well-known min
eralogist and a recent arrival from
Tonopah, when seen yesterday at his
apartments in the Palace Hotel, dis
cussed the case of the unusual number
of deaths which occurred in Tonopah
of late. He said:
It Is not plague that is prevalent In Tono
pah Just now. nor Is It a virulent form of
pneumonia. Three years ago I investigated
the potability of the desert waters, particularly
those of the Tonopah district. It was found
that some of the infiltrated 'waters contained a
small amount of the albuminoid of ammcnla.
This compound is generally derived from an
organic or vegetable source, but It may also
have its genesis In certain volcanic rocks â
that is. it may have a mineral origin.
It is not necessary here to show the miner
alnglcal sources from which it can be derived,
other than to say that such conditions and
mediums of generation are present in many of
the disintegrating products of vulcanlsm â va
rious volcanic rocks.
It is known that waters which contain
about sixteen parts of this albuminate to the
million are poisonous and to certain persons
organically predisposed are fatal.
Some of the waters I examined contained
fifteen parts, thus almost reaching the fatal
quantity. It Is easy to understand that the
accumulation of such a contaminating com
pound could take place within certain water
bearing strata, and that so long as the level
of the water which was being consumed re
mained in such a etratuit. the dangerous In
gredients could be present. The surface of the
subterranean supplies or reservoirs seldom re
mains at the same level, but rises and falls
accordingly as the supply Is great or small.
Consequently the particular level at which
such accumulation is found may either bÂ«
raised or lowered. If raised thÂ« poisons be
come diluted and thus harmless, or If lowered
then they may become concentrated so that
those dangerous conditions, if present at all.
are not stable, but vary. Â«nd this either
largely disappears or becomes so far diluted
that there is no danger.
No doubt, some source or supply now being
used In Tonopah has lately reached the fatal
level. As to the result on the victims, I be
lieve that It Is known that the action of this
rompounil in dangerous and violent on thÂ«
liver and kidneys. Severe swelling and con
gestion results. Functional Inaction nuper
vmsi and results fatally. If not quickly re
lieved. Such n swelling must necessarily react
on the luiiffi, by pushing up the Intervening
system and tluis aov^rely compressing the
breathing apparatus â just as the accumulation
of Internal gnsps due to Indigestion often com
presses the lungs.
It Is due to thin that the Tonopah victims
ascribe their malady to pneumonia â since In a
measure the extraneous pressure simulates or
resembles tlie symptoms of that dread disease.
T hue It is that an autopsy reveals swollen and
blaiÃened Intern?! organs, and hence they give
It the namo of black plague.
DEFENSE BEING HEARD
IX TWO MURDER TRIALS
Cases of Joseph Smith. Aged Contrac-
tor, and Elvlso Turchetti Are
Drawing to a Close.
The trial of Joseph Smith, the aged
contractor, charged with the murder
of Joseph E. McGowan on November
26, was resumed before a jury In
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday. The
case for the prosecution was closed,
and Attorney Ach outlined at length
wliat the defense would show. One
of the chief points was that a blow on
the jaw such as Smith received from
McGowan prior to the shooting would
have put Smith In such a dazed con
dition that he would not know for
some minutes what he was doing. Dr.
Dudley Tait was one of the witnesses
called upon this point, and other phy
sicians and some pugilists will give
their testimony also. Drs. Rottanzl,
Quigley and Herzog testified as to the
wounds on the defendant's head.
The trial of Elviso Turchetti,
charged with the murder of William
McAllister, at Pacific and Kearny
streets, on Christmas night,* was re
sumed before a jury in Judge Dunne's
court. Several witnesses were exam
ined for the defense, and the defend
ant took the stand. He said that Mc-
Allister and his friends started the
trouble. His brother's nose was
broken and defendant was pushed off
the sidewalk and fell on his hands.
When he rose he pulled a revolver out
of his pocket to intimidate his assail
ants and It accidentally exploded. Wit
nesses in rebuttal were being exam
ined when court adjourned till this
morning.
COMMERCIAL, MUSEUM GETS
FACTS ABOUT SICIL.Y LEMONS
No Shipments to American Ports Con

The Commercial Museum has re
ceived from its correspondent at Cata
nia, Slcilyfan estimate of the seasons
yield of lemons for the Catania dis
trict for export, which amounts to
1.100.000 boxes, of which 750.000
boxes have been shipped. Something
like 80,000 boxes were frozen or so
damaged by the cold weather as to be
worthless. This leaves 270,000 boxes
yet to be exported. There have been
no shipments to American ports this
season and none are likely to be made.
The ruling price for the Catania fruit

ARIZONA MAN
NOT MURDERER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz.. April 17.â When Lee
Hobbs was discharged from custody
this afternoon by Chief Justice Kent
there closed one of the most sensational
extradition cases ever recorded in Ari
zona courts. Hobbs established a per
fect alibi. The court records showed
that Hobbs had charge of a murderer
but a few weeks after the date of the
crime with which he (Hobbs) was
charged and which occurred in the
South Seas, thousands of miles away.
Hobbs was accused of killing John
Bennett Nixon, second mate of the
British ship Leicester Castle. His ac
cuser was the British Consul GeneTal
at San Francisco, Courtenay Bennett.
The Consul's evidence against Hobbs
at first seemed to be complete. It was
strengthened by that of a sailor who
claimed to have been on thÂ« Leicester
Castle and who identified Hobbs as the
murderer. To-day Thomas Lyons and
John Murray of a sailor's boarding
house in San Francsico declared they
knew intimately the Hobbs wanted,
and said the prisoner was not the man.
SCAB DAMAGES
THE FRUIT CROP
SACRAMENTO, April 17.â A. R.
Sprague, president and general man
ager of the California Fruit Exchange,
was to-day asked regarding the present
outlook for the fruit crop in the Sac
ramento Valley. He said:
"The prospects for a large fruit crop
have been steadily declining for the
past two weeks, especially along the
Sacramento River. So far as pears are
concerned, a very serious amount of
damage has been done by scab and
fungous disease, which is favored by
damp weather and has caused the
pears to drop very generally. Probably
there will not be more than one-third
of last year's crop. The prospect for
plums, however, is fairly good In that
district, with but very feu- peaches.
"Placer County is in very much bet
ter shape for a crop than it was last
year. They are likely to have fewer
cherries, but a fairly good peach crtfp
and. excepting Tragedies, a good plirm
crup. Grapes have not yet developed.
Pears are scanty and scabby, but full
crops of apricots also will help the
shipments from Placer County
"From Vacavllle we get reports of
an excellent crop of apricots, a light
crop of plums and a light crop of cher
ries. It is too early yet to forecast
the grape crop at any point.
"Taking it all in all* with short crops
in the East, the prospects for good
prices for shipping fruit this year from
California are excellent and this will in
part repay for the scanty crop in cer
tain sections."

BLAMES LAWYER
FOR IMPUDENCE
OAKLAND, April 17.â John W. Pres
ton of Ukiah earned a reprimand at
the hands of Judge B. F. Ogden this
morning in which the Judge told him
he was the most impudent attorney
that had ever practiced before him. It
was expected that as the result of his
actions Preston would be committed to
jail for contempt, but Judge Ogden did
not follow up the matter and Preston
was allowed to leave the courtroom
without further notice.
Prestan has been endeavoring to ob
tain a piece of property In Mendocino
County belonging to the estate cf
Thomas Harris, a supposed pauper, for
little or nothing, and had put in a bid
of $500 for 160 acres of redwood land
and made a statement in court t.o the
effect that there was a deed outstand
ing against the property to retard
others from bidding and claimed that
in naving found the land he should
be given the preference in purchasing.
In the course of his remarks he said
that he was only trying to prevent
himself from being defrauded.
"By whom? By this court?" ex
claimed the Judge.
"I mean by real estate men," said
Preston. "I am satisfied: that your
Honor is acting as fairly as I am in
the matter. I have investigated your
record and found that you are all
right."
"You are the most impudent man
that ever practiced here," returned the
Judge.
He then refused to consider any of
Preston's proposals and postponed the
sale of the land for two weeks and in
structed the Public Administrator to
try to get better bids far the property.
It is stated that it is worth about $3000.

WITH THE BUSY
DISCIPLES OF
MUSIC AND ART
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, April 17.â While fashion*
weary butterflies are resting their pretty
wings for the strenuous gayety that will come
with the post-lemen days, thÂ« busy folkâ the
people who "do things"â are still at It, ham
mer and tonsrs. With them there is never a
time like the present, and the immediate pres
ent is full of busy planning and busy prepara
tions for the immediate future. The clubs of
course, are always doing something, but any
number of events of interest in musical cir
cles especially, and not particularly club af
fairs, are engaging public attention.
A concert in which society, as well as the
musicians, in manifesting considerable Interest
is that scheduled to take place on the 25th
at Ke-d Hall, when Mabel Riegelmann will be
given a benefit. This will really be the young
singer's debut, for although she has kindly
given h^r services on several occasions for
club and charity entertainments, this will be
the first opportunity the public has had to hÂ»ar
h*r unc"tr favorable circumstances The fact
that she is Ruing to study in Europe as thÂ»
protege of Madame Gadskl Immediately en
etreies her In a halo of romance, for great
artists do not take ambitious but unknown
students under their protection every day. Mrs
Oscar kunlns, always an enthusiastic patron
of art in every form, has done much to en
couragÂ» Miss Riegelmann and further her in
terests, and now heads the list of prominent
women that are acting as patronesses of the
coming affair. Among those Tve heard men
tnned ere: Mrs. Matthews, Mrs. Standeford
and Mrs. Sharon.
Ablating Mlfs Rlegelmann will be: Norman
W. J'endieton, tenor; Rudolph J. Buchley vio
linist, and Eugene H. Blanchard pianist
Another event that Is, unfortunately, also on
the 25th Is the carnival of music that Is being
planned by the Unity Club, the Woman's Al

ber armed with a revolver held up Ivor

road, to-night at 9:15 o'clock in his bar
room, lining Paley and two strangers
who were in the saloon against the
wall while he robbed the cash till of $20
and took $2 from a slot machine.
As the bold robber departed he cau
tioned the trio of surprised victims not
to move until he was out-of sight un
der penalty of being killed. They
obeyed the command, but Paley quick
ly notified the Sheriff's office and the
police as soon as he thought it waa
safe.
The proprietor was behind the bar
when the intruder walked boldly into
the saloon and leveled a pistol at his
head with the command, "Throw up
your hands." To the other two men who
were in the room he gave the same or
ders, and marched the trio to the wall,
where he ranged them in line.
The robber speedily emptied the con
tents of the coin drawer and the slot
machine into his pockets. He was quiet
and cool, betraj'ing no sign of nervous
ness as he worked at the coin recep
tacles with one hand, keeping the men
under the sweep of his pistol with the
other. He wore a red sweater, the
neckband of which was drawn over his
face, two holes being cut in it for hlB

hat. He was five feet six inches tall
and weighed 150 pounds. Sheriff Barnet
and a force of deputies went out on

Doctor Harper
Cured fc>y
Electro-chemistry
Whrn the surceons of President Harper of I
the Chicago University cut him open to operate !
for appendicitis, they found that their dis-
tinguished patient was Buffering from cancer
of the colon (large bowel). His condition was
such that curgery could do him no good, so
the eurgeone tewed him up and agreed that
the only- chance to save his life was by the
erpMtation of Electro-Chemlstry. President
Harper was taken from Chicago to New York
<. liy for the application of this wonderful new
treatment. Notwithstanding the severity of i
the case. Electro-Chemistry helped him from I
Uie very start and now he is back at his ',
Rome m Chicago, probably out of danger. At- !
*Â«*SanjeritÂ« haw been made to continue the j
treatment at his home. In many cases Electro- \
fnÂ«mlÂ«ry is successful where surgery fails. j
Mr*. William Barnes of Blacks Station. Cal..
was told by her physicians that she would |
nave to undergo a surgical operation for the !
cure of a cancer of the breast Mrs. Barnes '
consulted two surgeons regarding the opera- i
won and both c found that the operation would i
be hazardous - irom her run-down condition,
due to the FprÂ«>adlng at this cancerous poison â 
throughout her system and because of a weak !
heart it would have been Impossible to have !
given her chloroform. Mrs. Barnes was advised I
to tak<* the Electro-Chemic treatment for the !
cure of her cancer, and on July if,, IPO2, she i
placed the treatment of her case In the care
of the Electro-Chemic specialists at No 118 ',
Grant avenue, San Francisco. The treatment j
was curative from the bÂ«ginninK. and in two i
ir.ontlib' time she . was . thoroughly cured, not
only was the cancer cured, but her general '
health wes improved by the Electro-Chemic !
treatment and she had gained ten pounds in i
- tvÂ«i|?ht in the two months she wae under the â 
treatment. It has now been nearly three years j
cineÂ« Mrs. Barnes was cured and she is in \
perfect health to-day without the least suspi-
cion of a return of the cancer. Many people
have called upon and have- written to Mr*
Barnes regarding her cure and It naturally i
gives this happy cured patient much pleasure :
to tell of her wonderful cure. The success of '
thfÂ« wonderful new- treatment in the cure of i
cancers, tumors, old tores, ulcers, lupus ec- !
zema and all other blood and skin diseases Is
marvelous and the results are just as satis- â 
factory in other serious diseases, such as con-
sumption, catarrh, asthma, bronchitis rheu- â 
matism, deafness, ringing head and ear' noise*
Â«Â»te.. etc., because the treatment ie thorough Iv I
constitutional In Its effects and because it at-
tacks the diseased condition In the blood where
the foundation of most diseases is situated '
In all disease* affecting the liver, stomach'
kidneys and bowels, the action of Electro- >
Chemistry id very rapid and in cases where
the stotr.ach has been poisoned by taking too '
much strong and poisonous medicines these I
poisons are thrown out, the blood Is built up
â¢nd purified and the patient is cured quickly
painlessly, permanently and cheaply The
Electro-Chemic Institute, the only one In San :
Franc!?â¢, la located at lIS Grant avenue tot"
ncr of Post street. The office hours are 'from !
nine in the morning until five in the afternoon !
and from seven to eight- at night every day
ID the week and on Sundays from ten in the

ftading the â at many patients that are now :
being treated at the Institute, the Electro-
Chemic specialists invite all the afflicted to
come to them for free consultation and cxamin-
nation. n<. matter what their trouble may be '

Â°* ixard with fear and apprehension to the ;
possibility of surgical treatment should not

whether or not the knife is necessary and In a I
great many cases the patient will find that a i

MAN AND WIFE
BECOME INSANE
Eastern Tourists Barricade
Themselves in Cottage and
Wreck Costly Furniture
WOMAX EESISTS AREEST
Two Unfortunate Travelers
Imagine That They Are the
King- and Queen of Heaven
Sreclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. April 17.â Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Drew, who are said to be
wealthy Eastern tourists, were taken
from a cottage at 393 East St. John
street by the police this afternoon.
They are raving maniacs.
The couple came here two weeks ago.
A few days ago they locked themselves
in the cottage. It soon became evident
to the neighbors that the couple was
insane, and to-day the police were no
tified. The Drews imagine they are
king and queen of heaven. Mrs. Drew
has been continually chanting sacred
hymns, and her husband has marched
up and down inside the house on sen
try duty shouting, "I an\ the king."
There was nothing to eat in the house
but a few dried prunes.
When Policemen Guerin and Hum
burg went to the house they were re
fused admittance by the Drews, but
they finally admitted the officers on
condition that they take an oath that
they came from "the lord of lords and
king of kings." Mrs. Drew fought the
officers when told she was under arrest
and scratched Policeman Guerin and
tried to bite Officer Humburg. She was
taken to the Red Cross Sanitarium,
where it became necessary to place her
in a straitjacket. Drew was taken to
the County Jail.
The interior of the house was a
%\ reck. A piano and other valuable fur
niture was broken and evidence of
wealth was strewn all over the place.
A bank book was found showing that
the couple have many thousands of dol
lars on deposit in Eastern banks.
The Drews are from Sauhegan, N. H.
They have traveled extensively. They
were in Oakland for a while, living at
951 Myrtle street. It is believed they
are the tourists who became insane on
a train while crossing the Rockies.

KILLS HORSE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, April 17. â An electric
car of the San Jose Railroad Com
pany at Willow and Delmas streets
this morning ran into a horse driven
by Walter West, an employe of More
head's pharmacy, wrecked the buggy
in which West was seated and killed
the horse. That West was not killed
seems miraculous. The conductor of
the car waved a handkerchief to an
other car conductor which frightened
West's horse. The animal swerved,
and before the car could be stopped it
struck the horse, breaking Its back
and killing it instantly. West jumped
from the vehicle and was dragged to
within a few inches of the car wheels,
but was not hurt.

RATTLER TRIES
TO BITE GIRL
Thick Stockings of Young
Woman Save Her From the
Fangs of Angry Reptile
CAMERA AROUSES SNAKE
Amateur Photographer Has
Trying Experience While
on Outing on San Joaquin
Special Dispatch to The" Call.
FRESNO, April 17.â While preparing
to take a picture of a rattlesnake yes
terday Miss Henrietta Savage of Clovis
was struck by the reptile's mate and
it was only the thickness of her stock
ing that prevented the venomous reD
tile from sinking its fangs into the
calf of her leg.
Miss Savage went for a Sunday out
ing on the San Joaquin River with a
party of girl friends. They lunched at
Lane's Bridge and soon afterward the
young lady saw a huge rattler sunning
itself in the sand. She stepped forward
without fear and was about to snap
the camera when she heard a warninsr
rattle at her feet. The girl stepped
back in time to see a yellow body flash
through the air. The snake had mis- ,
calculated the distance and the fanes
only caught in her thick woolen stock
ings. The plucky girl knocked the rep
tile off with one foot and then killed
it with her parasol.
After the danger was all over Miss
Savage became deathly sick and was
delirious for several hours.
KILLS PARTNER
WITH SHOTGUN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LINCOLN, Cal.. April 17.â Gus Linn,
better known as the "Terrible Swede,"
was killed by his partner, John Batch
elder, last night. There were no wit
nesses to the tragedy.
Linn drank heavily Sunday and
Batchelder left the cabin where *hey
were living and came into town to
avoid trouble. He returned about 9
o'clock to the cabin and found Linn
on a bed with a big butcher knife by
his side. Linn became abusive and
after a few words jumped up and at
tacked Batchelder. The latter grabbed
a shotgun and fired, killing his partner
almost instantly. After the shooting
Batchelder came into town and gave
himself up to Constable Lasswell.
It is the general opinion here that
Batchelder will be exonerated, as Linn
had a bad reputation. He was a big,
burly fellow, while Batchelder is small
and slight. Batchelder is the only son
of a well-to-do lumberman in Plumas
County and has always borne a good
reputation.

SUPPOSED DEAD
MAN IS ALIVE
Special Disoateh to The Call.
FRESNO, April 17.â After traveling
about the world as a vagrant for thirty
years, John H. Simpson, once a re
spected citizen of Bemis, Tex., was
reclaimed here to-day by his son Sam
uel, who is now a wealthy banker of
the Lone Star State. To-morrow the
father and son will start for the old
home to enjoy the riches amassed by
the son who began business on a $2000
life Insurance premium paid on ac
count of the supposed death of the
father.
John H. Simpson was born in Ken
tucky sixty-seven years ago. He moved
to Bemis, Tex., where he served three
terms as Justice of the Peace. One
night, when his youngest son, Samuel,
was 2 years old, Simpson, for no known
; cause, left home. Detectives employed
by relatives and by the Equitable Life
( Assurance Society, whose policy the
missing man >"Â»icl, searched in vain for
Simpson. All were baffled, but it was
not until thirteen years had passed
that the insurance company gave up
the search and paid the widow the
$2000, which afterward became the
nucleus of the spn's fortune.
The father traveled about the coun
try under assumed names, finally set
tling in Fresno, where he became well
known as a peddler. It was through a
schoolmate of his former days that his
whereabouts was finally discovered.

A PLACARD WAGON
Judge Murasky Gives Killing In Favor
of the Cooks' and Walters*
Union.
Judge Murasky decided yesterday
that while unions have no right to
maintain pickets or "sandwich men"

through the streets with placards dis
played setting forth the fact of a boy
cott.
The decision was reached in the case
of W. J. Kosta, proprietor of the Bal
timore oyster house. 21 Sixth street,
who sued to restrain the Cooks' and
Waiters' Union from interfering with
his business. Judge Murasky Issued

THE CARQUINEZ BRIDGE.
VARIOUS public and commercial bodies that have taken juris
diction of the subject have received from their committees re
ports in favor of the building, by the State, of a bridge across
Straits of Carquinez. The reports favor such construction as may
be used by all railroads, electric roads, road vehicles and live stock.
There is no bridge on the Sacramento below the city of Sacramento,
and a wagon bridge would greatly facilitate intercourse between the
ntry on both banks of that stream and both shores of Suisun Bay.
. Put railway and wagon traffic cannot be permitted to interrupt
or impair navigation. A bridge constructed by the State must re
ct the rights of navigation just as much as one built by a corpora
n. The Federal Government everywhere enforces this rule on
igable waters.
- -<=ippi. already spanned by many bridges, some of]
â  <iraw and some suspension, is now crossed by still another at
tebes, 111., which will be opened for traffic this week. Its cost is;
HO. It is a combination cantilever and is 231 feet above the
iter, constructed in five spans. It is an unusual height for a pier;
but modern methcwtS of construction permit structures that
â¢hie when the bridging of that stream began.
The physical difficulties in bridging the Straits of Carquinez are
ny. If the approaching grade permitted it could be crossed by
c.s as span the Scotch friths. This would require a change
the line and grade of the railroad on both sides, and seems to be
1 >. Engineering skill must therefore find means for using ;
hat will not disturb navigation.
nstruction by the State introduces an entirety new element
c matter. None of the reports that favor that plan has dis
:he authority of the State to do the work. The counties have
build bridge?. We believe the first bridge over the Sac
to was a county work. If a county can build a bridge over
navigable water at Sacramento, a county or two counties can do the i
avigable water at the Straits of Carquinez. Of this there
â¢'"> be no doubt, but no one has shown authority in the State
â¢k same thing. It may reside in the State's jurisdiction
â¢oral on tide waters. If not, where is it found?
The question is not analogous to the things done by the State
water front of this city. There authority is perfectly clear,
elusive. The counties of Solano and Contra Costa could I
he straits under such restrictions* as the War Department'
mpose. A corporation or the State would be under the same
The War Department can compel the bridge to accom- .
electric cars and wagon traffic, but it is doubtful whether the !
â¢uld impose such or any conditions upon the work. It is
thai for general use of wagons and livestock, a bridge at the j
UOt be as convenient as one farther up, spanning the j
rammto River proper. This is because of the restricted nature |
he approach at each end. This approach at Port Costa and
rowded already by the railroad yardage.
\ bridge has long been needed by the railroad and the public,
and but little has been done to even perfect the preliminaries for its !
â¢ ictkML To throw it upon the State will probably long delay
rk. All these things should be considered by the commercial
h wish to invoke the State. It will help toward a de- j
- '-odies will investigate the power of the State to do I
rk. We do not deny that the power exists, but its existence
ado plain. It will be seen that if the work is put upon the ,
itÂ« and it appear that the authority to do it is lacking and must be '
red either by legislation or an amendment to the constitution, i
rars and perhaps of four may be caused. It is desir- 1
avoid this, and the way to avoid it is by settling the question â¢
state's authority now.
The Mississippi bridge at Thebes required three years of im
hroken work in its construction. That at Carquinez or any point
on the river would surely require as much time. So it is quite
-ary to be sure that we are right before we go ahead. There
-her ca*es in the United States in which States have done
work. If so, they are likely to be known to the engineers, and
if they exist would give us some precedent for guidance. The Mer

TAXATION OF GOOD WILL.
|â^ RAN'CHISE taxation, when it is accomplished in such way that
â "â * the toll taken by the Government is not really on the value of
the privilege the State has granted, hut is a levy on the personal
capacity reputation for integrity and the good will of the persons to
i the franchise is granted, is the subject of a study in the "Polit-
Sctence Quarterly," by Carl C. Plehn of the University of Cali
fornia. It will be of special interest to the people of this State be
it is based on a decision of our Supreme Court last year, in the
â¢nent of the Bank of California, and shows the logi
cal connection of that construction of the law with the right to tax
the good will of partnerships and individuals.
In that case the assessment was made as usual on the capitaliza
tion of the corporation, but in addition to that, the Assessor, seeking
10 make taxation reach to personal property not shown up by the
of real estate, money, notes, etc., took the difference
en the agÂ£rrÂ£ate market value of all the stock and the enu
merated tangible property to be the value of the franchise, and de
cided that this value was taxable. The Supreme Court upheld him.
The paper on political science holds that this value as ascertained
by such method was not the value of the franchise, unless the prin
ciple is meant to be maintained that the mere right to be a corpora
tion is a taxable franchise. In such case the estimate goes far beyond
the mere cost value of a big franchise, in attorneys' and other fees,
etc., and is calculated on a value produced by the personality of the
men who control the corporation ; and so is really a tax on good will.
The vexed question then comes up of what is the meaning of the
term franchise when we consider it in the sense of a "franchise of
great value." It is said to have received its most ludd illustration
in a speech by David S. Terry during the Constitutional Convention
of 1878. He explained by taking the case of a bridge company ; the
value of the bridge bears no proportion to the value of the exclusive
privilege. It will readily be seen how the value of such a grant from
the State differs from the mere right to be a corporation, to which
large wealth may come from the personality, capacity, etc., of its
controllers.
It is held in the above mentioned paper that the taxation of
good will is wrong: that it runs counter to strong social forces;
that there is the strongest popular prejudice against the taxation of
that which is the result of personal qualities; that "a fair assess
ment of so intangible an item of personal property as good will is an
unattainable ideal, and, with the best intentions on the part of offi
cials, results in inequalities and injustice."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. APRIL 18. IDOS.
THE CALL PRINTS MORE NEWS THAN
ANY OTHER PAPER IN SAN FRANCISCO
FOR the information of newspaper patrons a comparative statement of
the news contained in the three morning papers for the week of April
9to IÂ£, inclusive, is given belowâ the foreign, Eastern, coast and local
figures referring to items; the marine, real estate, society, theatrical and labor
news being computed by inches:
Foreign Eastern Coast Local Marine R. Estate Society Theat. Labor
CALL 180 368 451 531 411 214 130 95 21
Chronicle 145 346 304 509 342 121 114 80 0
Examiner 57 217 156 371 362 106 108 10 22
This comparison shows that The Call leads the Chronicle 3J and the
Examiner 123 foreign stories, the Chronicle 22 and the Examiner 151 Eastern
stories; The Call leads the Chronicle 147 coast items and the Examiner 29 J.
In local San Francisco news items The Call leads the Chronicle by 22 and the
Examiner 160. The Call printed 411 inches of marine news, while the
Chronicle printed 342 and the Examiner 362 inches of the same class of news.
Of real estate news The Call printed 214 inches, the Chronicle 121 and the
Examiner 106. Society news received. 130 inches in The Call, while the
Chronicle devoted 1 14 and the Examiner 108 inches to this class of news. Of
theatrical news (excluding accounts of the opera), The Call printed 95 inches,
the Chronicle 80 inches and the Examiner 10. Under the classification of
labor news The Call printed 21 inches, the Chronicle did not publish news
under this classification, while the Examiner printed 22 inches.
From the above showing it must be conceded that The Call has more
thoroughly covered the news territory than any other paper published in San j
Francisco, while the manner of its presentation and the general character of!
the news printed is of such a nature that no successtul comparison whatsoever
can be made. When it is considered that newspaper patrons are buying and
paying for the news, is it any wonder that The Call's subscription lists are
increasing so rapidly?
SHIPMATES
SHE was alone; that much he
knew.
From the time the steamer left
Bremen until it struck out into
th .Â« open Atlantic h^> hardly 110
i ticiM her, but once at sea she spent
I every day on deck and always alone.
It was Colford's own loneliness which,
forced him, half unconsciously, into a
1 silent comradeship of sympathy with
'â  her. Ten years abroad in the Aus
! trlan consular service had made him
feel like a foreigner, now that he was
among his own countrymen again.
I Nearly every one else on board had
' friends, or made them readily, but for
; some reason â their own disinclina
â  tion, he thought â the two remained
I apart.
She was in mourning. The soft
' clinging black made her look even
! younger and more girlish than she
' was, and yet it gave her a certain for
' lorn dignity.
Once he passed her on a windy
morning up forward. It was early
and there was no one else on deck.
As he came abreast of her the wind,
1 in a vagrant frolic, blew her long chif
| fon veil across his eyes. It was a
clingy, exasperating veil. By the time
Colford was disentangled he was an
gry and embarrassed until he met her
laughing eyes.
After that he raised his cap when
they met and she acknowledged the
silent greeting shyly. One night a
wild ppring tempest broke in sudden
fury over the gray sea. It was after
midnight. Colford stumbled into the
cabin drenched with spray, and met her
face to face. Her face was white and j
1 phe held a sobbing child in her arms,
! soothing him gently, while the mother
had hysterics in a corner.
"There is no danger." Colford said.
She looked up at him smiling.
"I am not afraid. There is never
danger when one does not fear."
By the time Sandy Hook was reached
the sixth day, Colford knew he was
overboard. It was her shy dignity that
attracted him, her . ir of absolute self
reliance and reserve, when he knew she
was forlorn and desolate. She told
him her story tl.e ("ay after the Btorm.
It was a simple bit of tragedy, a
tragedy of circumstance. She was an
Austrian and an orphan. Her father
had been a Viennese surgeon.
"And after he died a year ago," she
had told Colford, leaning over the bul
wark, her gray eyes dreamily watch
ing the long, swelling waves sweep
back from the steamer's sides, "we
lived at Brazza on the coast, mother
and I. It was her old Home, and there
was nothing else to do."
"And then " said Colford. as she
paused.
"Then a month ago she left me also.
She told me to come to America. I
have an uncle, my father's brother, who

will meet me in New York. He is the
only relative I have in the world."
"Are you sure he will meet you?"
"I cabled him I was coming. He is a
physician also," she said gravely. "He
loved my father dearly. I know he will
meet me."
"And if he does not?"
She glanced up with troubled eyes.
"But he will. There is no one else In
all the world who would help me."
"One other."
Colford spoke quietly, but a trifle un
steadily, as he looked down Into her
serious, childlike eyes.
"You must not say there Is no one
else. I, too, am alone in the world.
Does not our mutual loneliness give us
a claim on each other? Surely you will
let me help you?"
A faint color rose slowly to her
cheeks. She looked back at the sea.
"I think I should, perhaps."
When the steamer swung from the
Hudson into Its slip on "West street Col
ford sought her for the last time. The
rest of the passengers crowded into the
bow of the boat, half-crazy with Joy as

they recognized friends and relative*
on the pier, but the girl in black stood
aft, looking back at the sunlit river â
back toward the open sea and Austria.
"Are you sorry it is over?"
"Europe?" She spoke wistfully.
"No. the voyage." He went on as she
did not answer. "Has it been nothing
at all to you? Do you care. Helene?"
The purser came hurriedly from the
cabin, a telegram in his hand.
"Helene Vorga?"
She opened it slowly. The message
was brief. Colford caught the paper as
it fluttered from her hand. It was from
a city hospital and merely stated that
Josef Vorga. physician, had died six
months previously.
"There is no one else," she said,
helplessly.
Colford led her to the cabin.

told her. "Let me be the one, Helene."
She waited where he left her. tear
less, hopeless, yet with the quaint dig
nity that seemed to enfold her like a
magic cloak of separation from the
world. It was half an hour before Col
ford returned. There was a new look
on his face as he bent over her, a look
of protection and determination.
"Dear heart, this glorious land of
the free refuses to let a little foreign
maiden all forlorn land on its shores.
You are a waif, sweetheart, a friend
less, penniless waif, according to the
officials downstairs, and as such they
propose in a friendly, courteous way,
to ship you over to Ellis Island as an
unwelcome immigrant, and deport you
to Austria on the first steamer sail
ing."
She smiled for the first time, a faint
ghost of a smile, though her eyes were
filled with tears.
"It Is terrible, I know." she said.
He took her hands In hiÂ«. "The land
of the free is willing to allow a girl
immigrant to enter, providing some
one marries her. Helene, It's Ellis

heart?"
The steward came up the stairs,

on the river a tug whistled shrilly.
"When one is alone," she began.
Colford raised the hand he held to
his lips.
"When two are alone," he correct
ed, "they cannot possibly be alone.
They have each other. The voyage
has only begun, little shipmate."

FACTS ABOUT BANANAS.
Under very favorable circumstances
a banana plant may give a stem of
fruit in nine months, but it generally
takes from fifteen to eighteen months
for the average plantation to be In full
bearing. The life of a plantation va
ries according to the fertility of its
Eoil and topographical situation. Some
soils may need a rest in six or seven
years, while others may last practic
ally forever, as in cases where periodi
cally enriched by alluvial deposits.
Sandy loam, through which water or
rain will freely percolate, is the best
soil for bananas. The stalk needs a
â¢large amount of rainfall for Its suc
cessful development, but water must
not be allowed to remain on the sur
face or immediately under the surface
of the soil surrounding it. lest the
water be heated by the tropical sun
and become stagnant, in which case it
may kill the plant

HIGHBINDERâ W. R, Fairbanks.
Cal. The Century dictionary defines
a highbinder as "a bold, roysterlng
rowdy; an insolent ruffian; on* of a
gang which commits outrages on per
sons or property for fun."
"Highbinders," so called, were known
In New York, Baltimore and other
cities of the United States before 1849.
In that year and subsequently
became familiar In California, where
at present the term is used only to
designate a member of a Chinese seer
society, band or gang existing not only
In California, but in other cities, asso
ciated for blackmailing purposes,
assassination. In the Interest or pay af
other societies or individuals.
The first printed record of "high
binder" in the United States that has
been discovered is the following* from,
the New York Evening Post of De
cember 2. ISO?: "A desperate associa
tion of thieves and unprincipled vaga
bonds, calling themselves 'highbinders â 
during the last winter, produced
era! riots."
The first time the word "highbinder"
was used In connection with the Chin
ese In San Francisco was in the early
seventies by a special policeman named
Delos J. Woodruff, who had a beat in
the Chinese quarter. In testifying la
the Police Court he said: "The trou
ble was caused by a lot of those high
binders.** The Judge asked him what
he meant by "highbinders" and his re
ply was "Chinese hoodlums." The lo
cal papers took up the word and from
that time , Chinese assassins and
hatchetmen were designated in print by
the term "hlrhbinderi."*

KILLS BROTHER
AND HIMSELF
EDectel Dtepafh to The Call.
STOCKTON. April 17 âThe home of
Henry Mohr, near Bethany. this
county, was the scene of a terrible
tragedy this morning, when William
Mohr deliberately shot his brother
George to death and then killed him
self.
George Mohr was eating his break
fast, when his brother entered the
room and, leveling a rifle at him, fired
two shots. One of the bullets entered
his chest and caused his death in a
few seconds. While the distracted par
ents were kneeling by the Bide of the
dying man, the murderer went to his
room, closed the door and, lying down
on the bed, sent a bullet through bis
own head.
There has been feeling between the
brothers for some time over a ques
tion of a division of profits on some
land farmed jointly. Added to this
there was a jealousy felt by William,
the elder, who thought that the par
ents favored George, the younger son.
This was aggravated by a weakened
mind, the murderer having been
"queer" for several years. William
Mohr was 24 and his brother two years
younger.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1905.
STORY OF THE DIVINE
TRAGEDY IS PICTURED
Mrs. Edward X. Rol
ker's Instructive
Lecture.
Passion Plag in the
German Village
Described.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
The Youths' Directory is one of San
Francisco's pet philanthropics â as it
should be.
Whenever a call comes for aid from
the thousands or more little lads who
find shelter and love and comfort in
the directory the response comes with
a will â as it ehould.
And when accompanying the call
entertainment is offered of a kind that
appeals, then is there a brave showing
of allegiance to our pet philanthropy.
And thus it came to pass, in the
maple room of the Palace last night,
that a lecture on the "Passion Play,"
as seen at Oberammergau, was given
by Mrs, Edward Xavier Rolker â
given in the dim, religious half-light
that diffuses "atmosphere," and makes
things to fit.
Accompanying the words of the
reader was a soft organ accompani
ment, played by Professor A. L. Ar
tiguee. While adding much to the
â atmosphere" of this, the saddest,
solemnest theme that men can know,
nevertheless it encroached somewhat
upon the speaker's presentation of the
sorrowful tragedy.
Wholly without pretensions as a
platform speaker, Mrs. Rolker gave
this talk some weeks ago at the Sa
cred Heart Academy in charming
fashion. So interested were the young
women in what she showed them upon
canvas, and talked about, that pres
sure was brought to bear upon her to
repeat the reading for all who would
care to hear â with the stipulation that
the funds go to the depleted treasury
of the directory.
And thus was the maple room
crowded with those who came to hear
the retelling of the divine tragedy, and
sweetly, reverently, touchingly was the
story told.
Gowned in a quaint grayish frock,
with limpid lace about her white
throat, Mrs. Rolker made a witching
picture, standing in a tangle of palms
and ferns; at her side lay a great
bunch of Bermuda lilies, whose sweet
breath rose like incense.
Among the views thrown upon the
screen were some superb scenes of the
"Passion Play," as given at the old
German village. From these the
earnestness and zeal of the villagers
are not only seen, but felt.
And as at "Parsifal" the "atmos
phere" prevented applause, even
where applause was due. And it was
â in the instances of the singers, Mrs.
Henry Ohlandt and Mrs. W. U Roth
child.
The patronesses, most of whom
were present, were as follows: Mrs.
Richard Tobin. Mrs. Eleanor Martin,
Mrs. Maurice Casey, Mrs. William G.
Irwln, Mrs. John M. Burnett, Miss
Jennie Blair. Mrs. Hyde-Smith, Mrs.
Alexander H. Loughborough, Mrs. J.

Monroe, formerly Commissioner of
Water Supply. Gas and Electricity, to
day told the story of a combination
that prevented competitive bids for
the city lighting contracts during
Mayor Low's administration.
Monroe testified that at times in
1902 there was absolutely no compe
tition; that there was virtually but one
bid for each kind of light and that the
city was "made to pay dividends, and
interest on an inflated capital." The
price of open flame burners for street
lamps was $17 BO per year, the same
price as obtained twenty years before,
when gas was $2 25 per 1000 to the
private consumer.

front and rear* doors of her house at 620
East Morrison street after a hard
struggle with W. J. Cain, the agent of
a picture enlarging concern, this morn
ing, Mrs. Mary Ogden held him and a
companion prisoners for an hour and
a half while the police wÂ«re answering
her summons.
The act of the woman borders on the
heroic. She accuses Cain of using in
sulting language and attacking her in
his effort to get out of the house with
out returning her property. Though al
most fainting at times, she says, she
clung to the man until he was safely
imprisoned. Then she called Contractor
Van Stone to assist her In watching the
house. Through a mistake made in se
curing the address the police did not
reach her house until an hour and a
half had elapsed.

AXGLO-FRENOH COMPACT

Renewed Assurances as to the Agree.

WASHINGTON, April 17.â Sir Morti

to-day discussed with Acting Secretary
Loomis the Moroccan situation and
gave fresh assurances that it was not
the intention of either Great Britain or

injuriously Â»to affect the commercial
rights of other nations in Morocco.
To show that the principle of the "open
door" was fully recognized at that time.
Article IV of that agreement was
cited, as follows:

SEES NO HARM
IN THE WALTZ
Dr. Alexander Gives Liberal
Views to Assemblage of
Presbyterian Ministers
CAED GAMES INNOCENT
Eminent Scholar Says That
Inebriety Is an Outrage
on Man's Moral Nature
Drunkenness, divorce, card-playing
and dancing were the subjects Pro
fessor William Alexander of the San
Anselmo Theological Seminary dealt
with in an address before the Presby
terian Ministers' Union yesterday. His
views were liberal in some measure,
and at least interesting. He spoke as
follows:
The remedy for the great and glaring evils
of drunkenness la not to be found til main
taining false principles and intemperately de
nouncing those wbo cannot In conscience ad
mit them, but In steadily avoiding the great
sin upon which the Bible i>lacee Its awful
brand.
The temperance reformers beoome a little
Intemperate themselves In denouncing all the
products at fermentation and distillation, as a
poison and nothing else, In opposition to the
opinions of chemists and physicians. Learned
English authority shows that stlmuianu of any
kind are hurtful when the system ia In a nor
mal condition, but when the system Is pros
trated below the normal then stimulants, ouch
as brandy, whisky or wine, are tonics and
helpful when administered in small quantities.
It la for this reason that physician* use
them as they do some virulent poisons, such
as arsenic and strychnine In small doses. I
consider It unreasonable and Intemperate to
rush to the opposite extreme and denounce
everything of the kind as always poisonous
and hurtful and never anything else.
I hold that It Is the duty of every minister
to advocate temperance In a scriptural and
temperate way. As regards saloons I believe
that, while not a rood word can be spoken
of them or that anything too severe can be
said about them, prohibition la out of the
Question In California- Prohibition does not
prohibit any way, except where publlo senti
ment prohibited practically without any law
on the subject.
Another social question of the first magni
tude which ministers are concerned Is that of
marriage and divorce.
The marriage relation I>m at the very
foundation of a Christian and civilized com
munity. Human and moral not to say spir
itual progress are almoet coincident with the
sacrednees attached to the marriage bond.
There are but two scriptural causes for di
vorce, one of the two being desertion of so
long and obstinate a character aa to prohibit
any hope of reconciliation.
No minister should ever marry the guilty
party again, and no divorced person should re
marry within less than a year.
The divorce laws of California and many
other States are so lax as to be the disgrace
of the country and of the civilization of the
age. The underlying error lies In the fact
that tho marriage relation is regarded merely
aa a civil contract which could be made and
annulled by the civil power for a variety of
reasons. Marriage Is more than a civil con
tract. It is essentially a religious Institution,
though not a sacrament. It was at the very
foundation of orderly civilised society. It Is
the natural and divinely appointed state of
human beings and should be between man and
woman for life.
Polygamy among* the Mormons Is an Im
moral violation of the lawÂ» of the land and a
disgrace to the civilisation of a Christian
country. It is not essential to the Mornrm
religion, for it had existed and still exists
â without polygamy. Consequently ther* need
be no hesitation In punishing it as a crime.
Polygamy should be put down with a strong
hand, and ministers should use all their in
fluence to preserve and protect the purity of
marriage in every way.
As regards the social question â card playing,
theatergoing, dancing and other recreatlons^ â
which are a source of much concern to pastors.
I believe the exactions must not be too rigid,
for it Is as natural for the young to desire
nome form of relaxation and amusement as it Is
for birds to sing or lambs to skip and play.
The harm, if any. Is in exceeÂ». I see no moral
evil tn handling a few pieces of pasteboard
called cards simply for amusement, but when
for money, even in small sums. It becomes) sin
ful and demoralizing.
I do not consider it wrong to "move" the
feet In harmony with the musrlo In danetng.
When all the parties are acquainted and meet
socially there can be no harm In dancing. The
line is to be drawn, however, at public halls.
In whloh any fellow that can raise a dollar
can get In, and whirl the young daughters
around in the dance when they would not re
ceive him socially In their houses.
As played now I regard baseball and foot
ball as Injurious to health and a strong prov
ocative to profanity.
In my youth danctng was condemned as a
sin. but social games In which a young man
often was required, tn payment of n. forfeit,
to kits some girl, were allowed. This T hold
to be more objectionable than a decent social
dance.

MINING COMPANY WINS
TIMBER-CUTTING CASE
Government Ixwes Suit Brought
Against the But to and Boston
Company.
HELENA, Mont.. April 17. â Fed
eral Judge Hunt, in ruling to-day in
the case of the United States vs. the
Butte and Boston Mining Company,
an action to recover for timber cut
upon public lands eighteen miles from
Butte, held that as the timber had
been out from the mountains near
Butte, the mining company had a
right to go farther away than is con
templated in the law which reads "ad
jacent to mines." He accordingly
granted the company's motion to dis
miss the action.

COLLECTOR JESSUP IS SHORT OF SPEED,
TOCOLAW WINNING UNDER WRAPS.
THREE FIRST CHOICES LAND AT THE OAKLAND TRACK
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
By once more failing to. uncover his
York form, Collector Jesaup sent
his followers home from Oakland track
yesterday as flat as If a rreight train
had passed over them. Tocolaw. pilot
ed by Knapp, not only led the New
Yorker from the start of the five-fur
long scramble, but merely breeaed in
ahead of him at the finish.
Th< winner had lirst call in the early
â it at 7to 10. Later on the friends
. f thÂ«* Collector unlimbered and it was
ev-n money and take your pick about
the two horses. Silver Heels ran a
itt "derate third.
The card, while not a particularly en
ticing one, drew the customary large
crowd. The betting was spirited, and
nt- three favorites reached home in
from, the talent did fairly well.
KPATHY BEATS YOLO GIRL.
Telepathy scored first time out in the
colors of Knebelkamp & Co. "Hand
riding " Kelly rode an excellent race on
th" filly. At odds of Â» to 1 she dis
posed of the favorite, Yolo Girl, by a
neck. Tenordale from Charley Patter
eon's 6table. on which there was quite
a play, finished third.
Fifteen exceedingly ordinary platers
started in the Futurity course run fol
1- wing, with McÃride's mount. Glen
Br.er, a mild favorite. The latter di6
pla.yed a flash of speed, then dropped
back. Frankie Neil's Crescendo gel
ciing Distributor receded to 10 to 1 and
Knapp plated him across the line an
easy winner over Pachuca, the second
choice. The show went to Parting
Jtnnie. a 16 to 1 chance.
Possart, piloted by Bullman and a
13 to 6 favorite, took the mile and a
furlong selling number in a gallop.
War Times cut out the early pace and,
with much effort, beat Ethel Abbott a
couple of lengths for the place.
SHEIUFF BELL NEARLY LANDS.
Sheriff Bell, a 16 to 1 shot, nearly up
**\. a good thing ln the mile and fifty
yard selling affair. A heavy and in
sistent play forced the odds about
Edgecliff down from 13 to 5 to 8 to 5.
ln a driving finish "Handriding" Kelly
on tht Sheriff only lost the verdict to
three-year-old by a neck. Red
Cross Nurs^-. which opened favorite in ;
the ring, ran third
oiis worked a remarkable transfor
n in the speed of Albert Fir.
Then, again, the track was just to the
liking of the Albert colt and he came
in f< â¢ ipport when betting be
gan on th^ final Fix and a half furlong
run. Ruby. thÂ»r favorite David
Boland and Morita were in front to the
h. Here Otis slipped through on
the inside with Albert Fir, and in a
mild drive led Morita past the judges
b> half a length. Robert Mitchell
d.mned Big Beach a kead for show
honors.
TRACK NOTES.
â¢Big Bill" Knapp carried off the
saddle honors in a walk by piloting
three winners.
Handriding Kelly finished first on
Telepathy and second with Sheriff
Bell, both rank outsiders. -
Possart was bid up $200 over his
entered selling price of 5400 by T. E.
McLaughlin. J. Case retained the
black horse.
Jim Neil claimed War Times for
$725. A few minutes later Jim was
offered $100 for his bargain and the
mare went back to' Mr?. Grossheim,
her former owner.
Bookmaker Hughey Jones, one of
the biggest ' winners at Ascot Park,
paid r akland a visit yesterday.
Hai .em Jockey Club's thirteen
stakes for which nominations closed
on April 1. received 1650 entries. Of
this number the Alliance, for two
year-olds, designed by Secretary Xa
thanson to produce the champion
youngster of the season, gathered 297
names, the list including every colt
and filly named for the Petite, Grad
uate, Youngster, Proviso and Junior.
Excluding the Alliance, the regular
list of twelve fixtures received an ag
gregate of 1353 nominations, the av
erage per stake being 113. the Har
lem National and M. Lewis Clark be
ing the only stakes with less than 100
entries. The continued popularity of
the Harlem conditions is proved by
the fact that the Hawthorne stake
book, with twelve parallel stakes,
shows 1099 entries, an average of 91
each, while Secretary Jasper has an
nounced that the Worth stakes, which
also closed April 1, have enlisted an
average of 50 nominations. The Har
lem stakes, with the number of en
tries to each and the actual values of
last year are here given, except that
the Harlem National has a guaranteed
value this year of $17,500, as against

SHRECK STOPS
GEORGE GARDNER
SALT LAKE, April 17.â Mike
Shreck of Cincinnati knocked out
George Gardner of Lowell, Mass., in
the latter part of the last round of a
furious twenty-round contest to-night.
The knockout blow was an overhand
right swing to the neck. Gardner rose
before the count of ten, but was so
weak that the referee stopped the
fight to save him from further pun
ishment. The fight was a slashing,
walloping contest from start to finish.
Neither man used science and the
battle became merely a test of en
durance. Blood flowed freely from
both the fighters. It was give and
take in about equal distribution until
the final round, when Schreck's super
ior staying qualities won him the fight.

lice a watch was kept at the railroad

McGovern, according to the sani

Govern, who escaped from a sanitarium
at Stamford, Conn., to-day, is at his
home ln Brooklyn, where he is being
cared for by his wife. He will be kept
there for a week when he will return
to the sanitarium. Immediately after
his escape he boarded a freight train
and came directly to this city.
At his home to-night he said that
after emerging from the woods and
finding he had eluded his pursuers he
walked along the railroad tracks until
a freight train appeared. Then, he said,
he put a large Btone on the track, com
pelling the engine driver to stop. When
he did so McGovern climbed aboard and
explained his situation. He said he
was recognized by some of the train
hands and they permitted him to ride.

COFFROTH STILL
SHY TWO VOTES
Supervisor Bent Holds the
Key to the Bemarkable
Situation in Polities
CONNOR IS A SURPRISE
Goes With the Yosemite
Club, Although the Oppo
sition Counts on Him
Manager Jim Coffroth failed again
yesterday ln an attempt to secure a
permit for the proposed Britt-White
fight from the Supervisors. He lost Su
pervisor Bent's vote, which he counted
on, and gained that of Connor, which
has always been figured with the op
position. The possibility of holding the
fight grows more remote as the days
pass. Manager Coffroth is still hoping
against hope that he may be able to
promote the affair.
The action on the permit before the
Supervisors was as fast as a sawed
off melodrama on a vaudeville pro
gramme. Clerk Fay had been reading
the routine business of the day in a
monotone and it seemed the end never
would come.
Suddenly he closed the record book
from which he had been reading and
said: "There is no further business
before the board."
Supervisor d'Ancona, who was pre
siding, said: "There being no further
business before the board, it stands
adjourned."
While he was making this announce
ment, Supervisor Boxton of the Police
Committee was on his feet trying to at
tract his attention. When he finally
did so there was a question whether
he was out of order. This technicality
was finally waived and Boxton was
allowed to introduce the majority re
port of the Police Committee, which
recommended the granting of the box
ing permit for April to the Yosemite
Club.
BRAUXHART OBJECTS.
Supervisor Braunhart at once inter
posed an objection and a vote by roll
call was necessary. The vote stood 7
in favor of the Yosemite Club and 8
against, as follows:
For â Alpers, Boxton. Connor, Gallagher, Mc-
Clellan, Rock, Sanderson.
Against â Bent, Booth, Brandensteln, Braun
hart, Compte. D'Ancona, Eggers, Payot.
Excusedâ Rea.
Absent â Lunstedt and Hocks.
The vote of Supervisor Bent was the
one which upset Manager Coffroth's
calculations. Three weeks ago, in
order to get a test of the strength of
the Yosemite Club, a resolution was
introduced to grant a permit to the
Hayes Valley Club. The vote was a
tie, each side having eight men. When
this vote was taken Bent voted with
those in favor of the Yosemite Club.
Connor, who voted for the Yosemite
Club yesterday, was absent on the pre
vious occasion. He has always been
counted as a Hayes Valley Club man.
Manager Coffroth figured that had
Bent remained with him and had Lun
stedt, who was late, appeared on the
scene in time, he would have secured
the coveted paper. He had the prom
ise of Rea that he would vote for him
if he had nine other votes. Rea kept
careful count as the roll was called
alphabetically. As he is next to the
last man to vote he saw Coffroth did
not have the required strength. He
then diplomatically asked to be ex
cused from voting.
LEVY IS OUTWITTED.
The meeting was adjourned so rapid
ly that Morris Levy of the Hayes Val
ley Club was unable to introduce a
number of affidavits as to the member
ship of the club, its gymnasium and
other details. These documents, he
claims, show he has complied with the
law and that the club is an amateur
organization under its provisions. As
the matter did not come before the
board, the fights postponed until to
night will not take place.
It is evident from the firm grasp
Foreman Andrews and his colleagues
have on the amateur situation that
there will be no more of these over
developed affairs. The promoters have
abandoned some they have projected
and they are awaiting developments.
Shrewd Charley Mitchell overlooked
one detail when articles were being
signed for the Britt-White fight, which
is of much importance now. Manager
Coffroth presided at the typewriter and
prepared the articles. One clause is to
the effect that Britt and White must
post a forfeit of $1000 each. Usually
the club is required to post an amount

apparently "forgot" to place this

STANFORD LOSES
TO WASHINGTON
Boat Race Results in Clever
Victory for the North
ern Men Off Sausalito
COUKSE IS EXCELLENT
Berkeley Oarsmen Anxious
to Measure Their Strength
Against the Cardinal
The crew of Washington University
beat the Stanford four by about one
and a quarter lengths over a two-mile
course yesterday at Sausallto. Those
â who were interested in the race . left
San Francisco by the 9:10 a. m. boat,
but the Washington shell did not reach
the San Francisco Yacht Club house a^
Sausalito till about 10:35, being brought
over from Oakland Creek on the power
boat Gazelle. The Washington crew
put out from the float first, being fol
lowed soon afterward by the Stanford
four. As the Washington shell carried
no cockswain, Glc/ster, the bow oars
man, steering with his feet, thirty-nine
pounds of shot in bags was placed in
the stern of the shell to compensate for
the cockswain, weighing 102 pounds, of
the Stanford boat.
After a short preliminary spin the
crews rowed to the north of the ferry
slip and were instructed by J. C.
Knight, the Washington coach, who
acted as starter. No. 3 in the Wash
ington boat had broken his oar and was
provided with a new one. The word
was given and the crews were sent off
to an even start. After rowing a few
strokes No. 3 in the Washington boat
broke his second oar and the crews
were recalled. At 11:30 they were sent
away again to a good start and no
mishap occurred.
Stanford had the station nearer the
Marin chore and Washington the out
side position. Both crews pulled a
stroke of about thirty-four to the min
ute, but the Stanford boat had no life
and the men lacked swing and style.
The Washington four pulled well to
gether and the boat seemed to travel.
The starter and other officials followed
the racing boats on the launch Flyer,
but could not tell the result, as the
launch was too far astern. The water
was smooth, only a slight breeze blow
ing. The Judges at the finishing line
were E. M. Garnett, the coach of the
University of California crew, and R.
H. Gaither, who helped instruct the
Stanford men. They were stationed on
the finore at Waldo Point. The dis
tance was estimated at two miles and
was covered in 10:30.
The winning crew was made up as
follows: Richard Gloster, bow and
steersman; G. Tilden, No. 2; Owen
Crin, No. 3, and D. Pullen, stroke.
The Stanford crew" was made up of
heavier men than the Washington. The
crew consisted of; H. G. Butterfleld,
bow; B. Bryan, No. 2; F. Zimmerman,
No. 3; W. H. Dole, stroke and captain,
and F. W. Turner, cockswain.
Both the coaches and the spectators
pronounced Richardsons Bay an excel
lent course for a rowing race. The
crew of the University of California is
desirous to meet the Stanford four, and
expresses its readiness to do so at any
time on any course. If the Stanford
varsity crew will not meet the Berke
ley senior four, the California fresh
men are ready to row against the Stan
ford freshmen crew.
BENCH SHOW ENTRIES
WILL BE HIGH CLASS
More Than Six Hundred Dogs Will Be
Exhibited Here Next
Month.
Entries for the May bench show of
the San Francisco Kennel Club are
pouring in rapidly and Manager H. K.
Carlton says positively that in class
and number the coming exhibition
will be greater and better than any
previous show ever held in the West.
There seems to be a sentiment in fa
vor of benching dogs this season and
many owners who have frowned on
the practice in the past are among the
first to apply for entry blanks and
premium lists this year. Collies and
cockers will be benched In profusion.
Fully 100 of each of these popular
breeds will be exhibited. The San
Francisco Cocker Club has so many
prizes at its command that Secretary
J. H. Jones is having trouble furnish
ing enough- classification to meet the
number of trophies.
Of sporting dogs there will be no
deficiency. Joe Terry. W. W. Van Ars
dale and others with annual entries
in the field trials will show the best of
their kennels. Boston and bull ter
riers will also have an excellent show-
Ing and the rarer classes will all Be in
evidence. In all it is estimated more
than 600 dogs will be benched.

PEOPLE IN HER CABINS
LINER FROM ANTIPODES MAKES PORT
Roosevelt's Gift
Reaches New
Zealand.
Oceanic Steamship Company's
Ventura. Captain Harward. ar
yesterday with freight and pas-
from Australia, New Zealand,
Samoa and Honolulu. She brought 330
â¢ gers and 2260 tons of cargo.
Fine weather prevailed throughout
the voyage, and the liner reachod port
and made all pointÃ of call strictly on
schedule time.
ThÂ« Hon. Hans W. H. Irvine, a
member of the upper house of the
Australian Parliament and the big
gest wine grower in the Antipodes, was
a passenger on the Ventura. In addi
tion to being a legislator and a vine
yardist, Irvine is interested on a large
scale In mining. He has come to Cali
fornia to see something of the vine
yards of the Golden State and to study
the newest methods in some of Cali
fornia's biggest and most important
mining centers. Irvine's vineyards and
wineries are situated at Great West
ern, about 160 miles from Melbourne.
He manufactures about 200,000 gal
lon* of wine per year, and sells most
In Australia direct to the con
sumer. He exports every year to Lon
don about 30.000 gallons. He owns
about 200 acres of grape land, and
handles the product of about 1500
acres. In his mining operations he
owns Quartz Â»nd placer properties,
does hydraullcking, and lately has
started handling battery tailings on a
lar^re scale by means of the cyanide
process. A man of vast wealth and
varied Interests, he Is counted one of
the foremost public men in the com
monwealth.
Among the passengers on the Ven
â¢vcre Lord and L.ady Ennirmore.
Some day, if he lives. Lord Ennismore
will be the fourth Earl of LisÂ«towel of
County Cork, Ireland. Ennismore
MH once a lieutenant in the Life
Guards, and he served with the Cav
alry Yeomanry during the Boer
war. He visited San FramlFoo, he
said yesterday, about fifteen years
lie is traveling now merely to
pass away the time. He is 39 years
old.
R. Colebrooke, another of the Ven
tura's passengers, is said to be going
to England to assume a title which
the death of a relative has released
for his use. Colebrooke, a man of tall
Mature and retiring disposition, is ac
companied by his sister, and the few
and non-committal words he vouch
re dictated to him by Miss
Colebrooke, who watched over her lit -
rother with almost maternal care.
Another passenger on the Ventura
Misp May Curtis, a singer of some
distinction from Melbourne. Miss Cur
ho has a soprano voice of excep
nonal range, purposes singing in the
States, and will probably be heard in
the near future In San Francisco. Dur
ing the passage of the Ventura Miss
Curtis pave a remarkably successful
.:. Triumphing over the difficulties
-.g !r. th> social hall of an ocean
*hp grave some of the germ from
the grand operae, and sang with equal
ance the most florid solos from
Verdi and Meyerbeer and the pleasing
fragments of such composers as Wille
vi Guy d'Hardelot. A collection
<=â  seamen's fund realized a sub
â¢ :al sum.
â¢ng the homeward voyage the cer
es attendant on the Ventura
ng the line were exceptionally
-ate and a source of great amuse
to the jiassengers. Cecil H.
ppon, an assistant mail agent
New Zealand, was making his
Mp, Mathieson. who is 25 years
rinded to a fellow passenger that
i never yet been kissed. The word
assed to the members of the crew
ust of the "crossing the line"
Dies, and Mathieson, who was
in the rigging, after being ini
a^cording to the rites ruling at
iurt of Neptune, was compelled to
the oakum-whiskered Neptune
The Ventura took from here the wild
-.'.? and birds presented by Presi
dent Roospvelt to the N>w Zealand
â¢,mtnt. One elk and three deer
died during the voyage, but ail the rest
iÂ« livpred in splendid condition.
Part of the shipment was released on
*.nd and the remainder on
Island. In the collection were a
er of raccoons, which it was not
tease. The New Zealand
received the animaJs had
res f >n the habits and
f thp American animals
-vhi< h they were not familiar.
ThÂ«>y knew just what raccoons liked
f-at, but overlooked the fact that
the 'coon is something of a climber.
They caged the raccoons in a roofless
domicile, and by next morning the
Roosevelt coons had disappeared.
On the outward voyage David Lynch,
a steerage passenger, who had left Syd
ney on the Sonoma for San Francisco
but who had developed insanity and
had been ordered back to Sydney by
the New Zealand authorities and was
being returned on the Ventura, jumped
overboard and was drowned shortly
after leaving Auckland.

MERCHANTS ASK
FOR MORE SIGNS
Board of Supervisors Is
Addressed Relative to
Need of Corner Guides
FULL SYSTEM NEEDED
Association for Adornment
of City Is Requested to
Design a Uniform Plan
The Merchants' Association has ad
dressed the Board of Supervisors on
the subject of providing more street
signs at street intersections In this
city. An appropriation is suggested to
supply a complete system of the signs
wherever they are not furnished or to
be furnished by the city lighting com
panies. The communication is as fol
lows:
The Merchants' Association respectfully calls
your attention to the lacK of street signs at
street intersections in this city. In view of
the increasing number of strangers visiting San
Francisco every year, the need for an adequate
system of street signs througnout the business
and rasldence sections of the city is becoming
more- apparent every day. Many tourists have
already unfavorably commented on the dif
ficulty of finding their way around San Fran
cisco on account of the entire lack of street
signs In some parts of the city.
The ordinance which formerly existed, re
quiring property owners on each corner of
street intersections to place and maintain, at
their expenso, street signs on their property,
was declared unconstitutional by the City At
torney in â¢an opinion given several years ago.
While it Is true that the gas lamps through
out the city are provided with signs indicating
,the names of srtreeta. and such signs In their
way arc very desirable, and should be main
tftlnpd by the company furnishing light, these
signs are not sufficient, as they are not always
plainly visible from passing street cars, aud
they are only visible to persons sitting on thÂ«
side of the car next to tne sign, while both
sides of each street Intersection should be pro
vided with signs.
We therefore recommend that a sufficient
appropriation be made In the tax levy for the
ensuing fiscal year to provide the city with a
complete system of street signs wherever they
are not furnished or to be furnished by the city
lighting companies. Also, that the Association
for the Improvement and Adornment of San
Francisco be requested to suggest the kinds of
signs to be used, their location, etc., in order
that they may conform to D. H. Bumham'a
plan for the general Improvement of the city.
Yours respectfully,
THH MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION OF BAN
FRANCISCO.
FRANK J. BYMMES, President.
I* M. KING, Secretary.
SUPREME JUDGES RETURN
FROM LOS ANGELES TERM
Decide That Former Public Adminis-
trator Is Xot Entitled to Fees
After leaving Office.
The Supreme Court resumed its
regular sessions In this city yesterday
after a week's term in Los Angeles.
Chief Deputy Clerk Oscar Tolle is
busy preparing for his departure for
that city, where he will assume the
chief clerkship of the court.
The court decided that C. V. Kel
logg, former Public Administrator of
Los Angeles, is not entitled to
J4557 72 held by him as commissions
for administering eight estates after
relinquishing office. The county of
Los Angeles sued for a return of the
fees and the Superior Court decided
that the money belonged to the coun
ty. The Supreme Court held that
after leaving office Kellogg was acting
as public trustee over public estates
and that he could have relinquished
the administering of the estates at the
time he left office.

CAPTAIN DUKE
CHARGES KEYS
Superior Officer Accuses Pa
trolman of Drunkenness
and Neglect of His Duty
FINDS SUSPECT ASLEEP
Had Been Detailed to Arrest
Poolsellers and Failure
Led to an Investigation
Patrolman Peter Keys of the Central
station is accused by Captain Duke of
neglect of duty and being intoxicated
while on duty.
, Keys was detailed to stop poolselling
In Ned Lannigan's poolroom, on Powell
street, near O'Farrell. His instructions
were to closely watch the place and to
arrest the proprietor in case any pools
were sold.
Last Friday Captain Duke, suspect
ing that Keys was not attending to
business, quietly entered the poolroom
and found Keys asleep.
Duke immediately awakened him and
ordered him to accompany him to po
lice headquarters.
Keys at flrst refused, but under the
threat of being formally deprived of
his star he consented to go with his su
perior officer to the Qentral station.
After entering the station Keys called
upon several of his brother officers to
prove that he was not intoxicated, but
his entreaties fell on listless ears. Duke
then formally accused Keys of being
intoxicated and announced that he
would prefer charges against him the
following day. The disgraced policeman
was told to go home and report for
duty the next morning.
Keys denies the charge that he was
intoxicated. He says he will be able to 1
satisfactorily explain his conduct when.i
the case is heard by the Police Com
missioners to-morrow night.

DEADLY POISON
ENDS DEBAUCH
Young Men of Prominent
Families, Slaves to Drink,
Kill Themselves in Denver
EMPLOYED AS SERVANTS
Herbert Gorham and Â»Wm.
Fagin Found Dead in Their
JRooni, Located in a Barn
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, April 17.â When A. R. j
Thompson of 1252 Clarkson street burst
open tbe door of a room in the second
story of his baxn this morning ha was
horrified by the discovery of the bodies
of Herbert Gorham and William A.
Fagin, to whom he had rented the room
two months ago. An investigation
showed that the two men had swal
lowed a draught of cyanide of potas
sium, two cups on a table containing
traces of the poison. They had been
seen alive on Tuesday, but nee. since
that day, and it Is supposed they took
the poison Tuesday afternoon.
Gorham was a member of the Gor
ham family of New York, widely
known as silversmiths. He had been
disowned by his family and became a
coachman. Fagln's relatives in Phila
delphia are prominent and own large â 
tracts of real estate in the Quaker City.
Fagin had received remittances from
his relatives at intervals for a long
time. Recently he secured a large sum
and then began a carousal, which end
ed when the two men swallowed poison.
When the room was rented two months
ago James Brown was one of the ten
ants. He and Gorham attended to the
stables, lawns and furnaces, while Fa
gin cooked for them. Recently Brown
secured a steady position and left.
Gorham had made several previous
atempts at sucide, and it is supposed
that when the two men exhausted their
funds he suggested that they take poi
son. The Coroner has notified the rela
tives of both men and is awaiting in
structions regarding the disposition of
the remains. The two men had been
in Denver several years and knew
each other in the East. Both were
slaves to drink and sank into the
depths.
To Discontinue Postofflce.
WASHINGTON. April 17. â The
postofflce will be discontinued on May
31 at Kern, Kern County, and will be
made a station of Bakersfleld.

DETECTIVE LEAVES FOR
GRIDLEY TO SEE SUSPECT
Two Boys and Roustabout Dispute
Each Other's Claim for Finding
Parts of VUardo'9 Body.
Detective Steve Bunner left last
night for Grldley. Butte County, to
have a look at the Italian arrested
there on suspicion of being Pietro
Torturiel, the murderer of Biagglo Vtl
ardo. Although Captain Burnett has
small hope of the suspect being thÂ«
much wanted murderer he will take no
chances. Bunner knows Torturiel and
will be able to settle the question of his
identity.
Coroner Leland will be called Upon to
settle a dispute regarding the payment
erf the usual $10 reward for recovering
dead bodies from the water. William,
Barlow, a roustabout of Fisherman's
"Wharf has interposed a claim for the>
reward as against the claim of Joseph
and Raymond Lanteri. the boys who
made the discovery of the sack con
taining the head and UmDs of Biagglo
Vilardo. Barlow says that when thÂ«
boys saw what was in the sack they
ran away and that he secured it.
Bartenders Walk Out.
George Geoppert, who conducts thÂ«
Barrel House at 115 - O'Farrell street,

had been under surveillance for soma
time and when Geoppert showed them
the reports of the detectives this morn
ing they were indignant. On the re
turn of the proprietor from lunch h*
found them lined up for their pay.

Washington Crop Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Sallsourj'. Section Di
rector, I'rilted States Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Crop Bulletin, week ended April
11. is as follows:
The past winter was an unusually mild one
throughout, with lees than one-half the usual
emoupt of snow, and the total rainfall was
considerably below normal. There was one
moderate cold spell, in February, which froze
out th* winter wheat pretty badly in the
southeastern counties, where the enow had
melÂ«>d oft*, but did little injury In the eastern
and northern counties where the Â«now re
maiapd. It was at no time cold enough in
the western counties to injure wheat. With
the exception noted, wheat that germinated
came through the winter well. But. on ac
count of the flry Foil much wheat failed to
oome vÂ© in the central counties, and many
acres ha to be resown this spring.
The wheat that came through the winter
has madÂ« splendid progress. March was so
â warm and dry in the fore part that much
spring cowing was done, and considerable
tprini? wheat has already come up â which hed
a good start. The spring ie a forward one,
and crops are In very promising condition.
Much plowing for summer fallowing has been
cone. Spring wheat sowing ie well advanced.
oats are about one-half gown In the eastern
counties, Rnd about the came in the eastern

Xevr York Stock Market.
XEW- YORK. April 17.â There was Consid
erable â¢ unÂ»ettiement manifested In the stock
market to-day, which was partly due to th*
carrj-ing over of a bed Impression from Sat
urdw on account of the rather urgent pres
sure to take profits on the week's rise.- This
Impression ' as partly dissipated by the buoy
ant opening 1 this morning, but the high prices
made then invited renewed selling and served
to discourage the confidence of operators for
higher prices. The market for the rest of
the day was tpotty and irregular. The selling
on the opening rise was of such volume and
character at "was not to be ignored. It was
generally supposed to be due In part to the
nf-oeagjty of protective measures in connection
with the wheat speculation. Various pub
lications poicttag to the hazardous position of
those committed to the wheat deal â¢ made
opinion sensitive on "â  i- point. In the wheat
market itself the weather news helped to sus
tain prices and to that extent- relieved ap
prehension over the Immediate situation of the
yield. But on the other hand the possibility
of damage to the crop by the unseasonable
weather if a disadvantage to values of stocks
and had its part in coolinjr the demand. The
wintry weather carried Its threat of damage
to other crops as well ' and was one of the
appreciable factors in to-day's .slock market.
Another was the assembling of â¢ the Senate
committee to investigate the problem of rail
road rate legislation. I This topic had fallen
into the background during the recent enthu
siasm in the stock"- speculation. . The reports
of the committee's Intention served to bring
U into consideration again with its ultimate
posfibi!tes when Congress assembles. Ralroad
officials continue to talk In very confident
terms regarding traffic, but their usual weekly
interviews were of a more restrained tone
than for come time pact. While these minor
considerations played their part the market
contmuea to give the principal attention to
the queptloa of the Northern Securities dis
tribution and the readjustment growing out
of it. TVhila the mandate of the Supreme
Ccurt issued, as was expected, there was still
the absolute lack of official announcement or
confirmation for any of the many stories of
(Seal* eupposed to be awaiting this event.
The situation proved a strain to speculative
confidence, especially in view 'of the highly
concentrated character of much of the selling
of Unien Pacific and the fears aroused as to
what it might imply. This stock and Northern
Eecuritleg on thÂ« curb reacted with some
violence after Uie opening and carried depres
sion ir.ta the other stocks which have moved
in sympathy with them The exceptional
strength shown by St. Paul did not serve
altogether to offset this influence. Neither

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
The market for old Potatoes opened the week
firm, with trade active, particularly in table
kinds, and prices of river Burbanks had an
other advance. Receipts of new Potatoes were
light, but there were large lines of carried
over stock on hand and the market remained
weak. Onions were held firmly at unchanged
rates. The steamer Ventura arrived late In
the day with several consignments of Austra
lians.
Receipts of Asparagus over Sunday were
heavy, approximating 1600 boxes, and prices
declined sharply. Rhubarb was still In ex
cessive supply and dull, while all the other
vegetables were firm.

Large receipts of Butter continue the dally
rule. but. as several times mentioned of late,

ments, and In fact the feeling Is rather steady
than otherwise. Quotations remain as at the
cloee of the week.
Easiness is still reported in Cheese, but
prices continue unchanged.
There Is no change In Bggs. Some houses
are quoting 20c in a email way, but this

B. H. Merrett, a Cwrpenter,
Arrested on the Charge of
Cruelty to a Minor Child
VIOLATES PENAL CODE
Policeman Scott Sees Three-
A ear-Old Boy Puffing Vig
orously at a Cigarette
R. H. Merrett, a carpenter, was ar
rested yesterday morning by Police
man W. D. Scott and booked at the
City Prison on charges of cruelty to a
minor child and violating section 398
of the Penal Code. He wae released
on tXh bail on each charge.
Scott, who is attached to the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society, was passing
Third and Mission streets about 11
o'clock when he observed a boy about
S yeare of age smoking a cigarette.
The boy had a short cane in his right
hand and, striking Scott on the leg
with the cane, replied to his question
ks to who gave him the cigarette.
My papa." Scott asked him where his
papa was and the boy, pointing to
Merrett, who was standing a few feet
; , said: "There he is."
Did ytru give that boy a cigarette
oke?" asked Scott, and Merrett
truculently replied: "Yes, I did. and
I'll give him all the cigarettes to smoke
I've a mind to." Scott showed him his
t^tar and placed him under arrest.
Merrett took the boy to the City Pris
oa and in a few minutes was released
after putting up the $50 cash bail. He
<^d to say where he lived.
Secttoa 30* of the Penal Code pro
vides that "Every person who sells,
furnishes in any way to an
other, who is, in fact, under 1Â« years
of agf. any tobacco or preparation of
o. is guilty of a misdemeanor."
The penalty is a fine not exceeding
$100.

Hubert Vos Booked to Sail for
the Orient on the Steamship

Hubert Vos of New York, one of the
< el^brated portrait painters of the
country, sails for the Orient to-day on
the steamship Manchuria. His desti
nation is Peking, but he will pause
at Honolulu and sojourn for a short
time at Yokohama. Shanghai and
othT places. It is highly probable
that Mr. Vos wi! be commissioned to
r^int some of the high-up rulers of
china. Time will be devoted in Japan
and other r ountries of the Orient to
the pursuit of his study of the aborig
inal races. He fully comprehends that
China will be the center of great
ev-nts within the next decade. His
standing in the world of art will
? him into close touch with the
eminent men of the empire and with
soldiers and /statesmen of Japan.

Genevieve Valencia, granddaughter

not of sound mind, and that the in
s-trument was obtained by Jennie A.

ercise of undue influence, menace and
fraud.

NOT HIS SONS,
GATES INSISTS
Father Declares Men Killed
in Arizona Were Not
the Fugitive Brothers
SEES THE PHOTOGRAPHS
Detective Thacker Is Not
So Positive Therefore as
to His Identification
C. G. Gates, father of the Gates boys,
after comparing the photographs
brought back from Lordsburg, Ariz.,
by John Thacker, the Wells- Fargo
Company detective, emphatically de
nies that the two men killed th<?re by
the posse were his sons.
'â¢My wife has not been rendered an
invalid by the report that her sons were
dead," said Mr. Gates yesterday. Far
from it, she has every reason to be
lieve that her boys are safe and alive.
"Those men killed in Lordsburg,
Ariz., were not of the Gates family, as
any one can readily see by a compari
son of the pictures here with ' those
given me by Thacker.
"My sons have been accused with
every crime on record since newspa
per stories reported their connection
with the killing of Express Messenger
O'Neil, and in justice to them and my
self I think that the crime at holding
up the saloon at Lordsburg should not
be attributed to them."
John Thacker of the Wells-Fargo
Company detective force saw th<- bod
ies after they had been buried nearly
four weeks. They had been exhumed
twice in the meantime for examina
tion. He says he made a careful in
spection and found a remarkable re
semblance to the Gates boys. The
heavier of the two bodies, supposed to
be that of George, had plain marks of
the gunshot wounds as set forth in
the description of George Gates. The
smaller of the bodies had the crown of
a front tooth pulled or broken off and
this corresponded with the description
of Vernon Gates. The weight and size
were the same in each case as that of
the hunted men. Either remarkable
resemblances or the Gates boys them
selves, says Detective Thacker.
In view of the positive denial of the
father that the men killed in Lords
burg are his sons, Detective Thack
er would not give a positive opinion as
to the identity of the dead men.
Teamsters Oppose Safety Station Site.
The Teamsters' Union yesterday
asked the City Engineer to have the
new safety station at Powell and Mar
ket streets constructed directly in
front of the end of Powell street,
claiming that the slippery grade be
tween the site that has been selected
and the sidewalk made teaming past
the point difficult. City Engineer
Wnndworth made a careful inspec
tion of the station, which is already
under process of construction, and
concluded it would better remain
where it is. just across from the Eddy

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRILV;IB,- ;1905:
POLICE JUDGE PRAISES
OAKLAND TOWN.
REBUKES A â  RESIDENI
Indulges in Mind Reading and Conveus Woe
to Defendant With Libel at Heart.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Until he announced that Oakland
was his place of residence, Meyer
I.ando engaged no especial attention
from Police Judge Cabaniss, before
whom he was charged with disturb
ance of the peace and battery. The
complaining policeman had testified
that the defendant stood in the middle
of a car track on Market street and ob
structed traffic by refusing to move
and that he resisted arrest even unto
the extreme of striking his custodian.
When the Judge, with usual per
functoriness, asked Mr. Lando what
he meant by so offending, the answer
was, "I live in Oakland." and the
bench instantly perked up.
"You live in Oakland, hey?" sharp
ly exclaimed his Honor. "And per
haps you imagine that this court will
consider your living in Oakland in the
light of an excuse for the offense here
chp.rged against you? Probably you
are now saying to yourself, 'This Judge
will say something funny about Oak
land folk being strange to metropoli
tan ways and then he'll let me go with
a warning.' Oh, you needn't shake your
head, for I'm sure your thought was
to that effect. Bui you fooled your
self. This court knows that Oakland
is not a benighted hamlet, but an up
to-date, progressive town, with elec
tric railways and lights and daily
newspapers and theaters that charge
more than 10 cents for admittance.
So you made the mistake of your life
when you thought this court would
liberate you on the assumption that
you are unaccustomed to meeting
street cars and consequently inexpert
in getting out of their way. There is
no leniency in this tribunal for the
Oaklander who blows out the gas or
blocks passenger traffic. Oakland is
entitled to protection from unjust in
sinuations of backwardness cast by Its
residents abroad. I'll sentence you to
morrow."
Mr. Lando staggered blindly from
the presence.

Milton O'Farrell was accused of
keeping an opium den on O'Farrell
street, between Powell and Mason, and
thrc-e 'white men and an equal number
of white women were charged with
having visited the "joint." Patrolman
Pearl, who led the raid, did not catch
any of the defendants in the act of
smoking, so Judge Cabaniss perforce
dismissed the cases after warning the
defendants that if they ever are con
victed before him of "hitting the pipe"
outside of Chinatown he will inflict
the extreme penalty.
"It's bad enough to smoke opium in
the Chinese quarter," said his Honor,
"but to pollute a business street with
the fumes of the drug is a very serious
misdemeanor."
"Pollute?" exclaimed an attorney
for the defense. "If the court knew
much about the particular block In
which these arrests were made he
would regard the smoking of opium
there as a means of fumigation instead
of pollution."
His Honor explained that he intend
ed the verb to be accepted in a sani
tary rather than a moral sense.
â¢ â¢/â¢
"You are unfit to wear that uniform,"
said Judge Conlan to Thomas Davla
and Fred Criswell, privates In an In
fantry regiment stationed at the Pre
sidio, who were arrested for begging
money from visitors to the Chutes.
They pleaded that they desired to ob
tain car fare to enable them to ride to
their quarters.
"A soldier who respects himself and
the flag he serves under would walk a
thousand miles ere he would even think
of begging alms from strangers," said
his Honor. "I will sentence you fellows
to-morrow."
Raymond St. John, a rood-looking
young fellow, said it was a combination
of poverty and devotion to billiards
that led him to steal $100 from his em
ployer, a Mission street coffee mer
chant, who seemed reluctant to prose
cute.
"Stealing is stealing," quoth Judge
Mogan, "and I doubt that it finds ex
tenuation in love of billiards any more
than It would In passion for betting on
the races or In slavery to drink. I'll
think It over, however."
Martin Seeley, hero of three wars, ar
gued his own defense before Judge Ca
baniss, and made a rather neat job of
it. He was charged with having bat
tered Henry Daeeking of 1 Polk street,
and when called to plead he moved for
dismissal on the ground that he had
been once in Jeopardy, the original
charge of assault with a deadly weapon
having been dismissed by the same
magistrate.
"I cannot grant that motion," said
the Judge.
"Then I ask the court to return to
me the $25 ball which I have deposit
ed," said the veteran, "aB I need the
money in my business. I give you my
word of honor that I shall appear here
when summoned to do so."
"Tour money is returned and your
word taken," said the Judge, "because
you are an American soldier, and an
American soldier never runs away. The
case is continued."
Mr. Seeley was a captain of scouts
in the iAmerlcan-Snanish war. in the
Britiih-Boer war and in the march of
the allied forces on Peking. He is the
son of a United States naval captain
and enlisted as a private cavalryman to
fight in Cuba. Now he is pursuing the
calling of civil engineer.

While an industrious plumber was
working at Mission and Lafayette
streets last Saturday afternoon James
Tobin called him a "scab" because the
union hour for cessation of labor had
passed, and when the plumber tried to
explain that he was receiving extra
pay for his extra toil James waxed
still more wroth and struck him. When
asked by Judge Conlan what he did for
a livelihood James replied that he had
no regular vocation, but did not con
sider that fact a hindrance to his chid
ing of a "scab." Whereupon the Judge
said, "Tush, tush," and ordered James
to appear to-day and receive sentence
for peace disturbance and battery.
E. Delmont, M. D., residence and of
fice at 1129 Union street, spat upon a
Market street sidewalk and was ar
rested by Patrolman Davids and
charged with having violated the anti
expectoration ordinance. The doctor
pleaded that the alleged offense was
resultant of an involuntary emission of
the salivary glands, and Judge Mogan
postponed further hearing of the case
until he has consulted a medical dic
tionary.
Judge Cabaniss declined to trans
form his tribunal into a collection bu
reau for the accommodation of Michael
Lathuris, who professed willingness to
withdraw hi* charge of battery against
Peter Geffors if the court would compel
Peter to pay the $75 wages which Mi
chael was trying to obtain from him
when the battery was committed.
Michael and Peter are children of
Greece.
"I'll dismiss this case," said his ;
Honor. "Although you, Michael, can :
hardly be blamed for endeavoring to '
avoid placing your claim in the hands
of a regular -collector and the paying
of his commission, this court must pro- j
tect its dignity, even when Greek meets j
Greek and the inevitable war tug j
comes".

Baptisto Guillardo arrived from Val
lejo last Saturday evening, heard Sig
nor Caruso sing in "Gioconda" last
Saturday n;ght and was arrested fo.
drunkenness last Sunday morning.
Judge Conlan permitted him to return
to Vallfejo yesterday afternoon.
It was the banjo that led to Enrique
Nantuy's undoing. When he purloined
the instrument from a Barbary Coast
restaurant he also did steal and carry
away one pair of corduroy trousers,
the property of the cook, but he might
have escaped detection If he had ab
stained from playing the banjo, be
cause the nether garments were of
common material and pattern and the
pursuing policeman would have found
it difficult to recognize them in a dis
trict where such pantaloons were en
regie. When arrested, however, the
corduroys were on Enrique's limbs and
their identification helped to cinch his
guilt.
No person saw the theft committed,
nor was any person especially suspect
ed, and when the detective was in
formed of it his only hope of catching
the thief was to find the plunder. A
search of the pawnshops was fruitless,
and the "stool pigeons" could give no
promising clew. The sleuth, therefore,
was ready to bet against his own suc
cess when it came to him through En
rique's indiscreet fingering of the sto
len instrument. Seated in his apart
ment he was softly picking the strains
of "A Dark Man Is Coming With a
Bundle" when the Nemesis heard the
tinkling sounds and caught the robber
with the goods.
Judge Mogan announced his inten
tion to commit Enrique to the Supe
rior Court.
Dr. J. J. MeddoÃ of Alameda paid
dearly for his imprudent bestowal of
confidence In the apparent uprightness
of two youths whom he casually met
for the first time last Saturday even
ing. They invited him to accompany
them in an automobile trip to the
beach, and the vehicle they hired was
kept in active service for several
hours, at the expiration of which pe
riod the doctor's companions vanished
at Stanyan and Halght streets, leaving
him to settle with the chauffeur. His
Inability or his unwillingness to pay
for the ride led to his arrest, and Judge
Mogan gave him until next Saturday
to either pay the "chauff" or produce
in court the persons by whom he al
leged he was deluded.
Nathan and Louis A. Blumberg, ac
cused of accepting In pawn military
garments and accouterments owned by
Uncle Sam, were before Judge Fritz on
the charge of conducting a pawnshop
without a license. The cases were con
tinued. It is understood that the de
fendants w4U be prosecuted also under

ment Caib Wants En
gine on Ashbury Heights
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
received an offer from the Merchants'
Ice knd Cold Storage Company to fur
nish free of charge salt water for
sprinkling the streets. Supervisor Eg
gers presented the communication,
which was referred to the Street Com
mittee. The company states that it is
pumping 1,000,000 gallons of salt wa
ter per day, which" could be utilized
for sprinkling purposes and also for
supplying the street flushing appara
tus. The only expense to the city for
the water would be the nominal one
of making the necessary pipe connec
tions from the plant to the water wag
ons. The company says it makes the
offer to the city in the interest of
cleaner streets and in view of the fact
that many of them are not being
sprinkled at the present time\
The claim of Patrick Creightoon
for $25,135 for certain street work
done by him in 1868, 1869. 1870 and
1872 was rejected. The courts will
now be called on to decide the valid
ity of the enabling act of the last
Legislature to permit of the collection
of demands for street work for which
no compensation was received by the
contractors owing to errors and ir
regularities of the city officials in pro
ceedings concerning the work.
The petition of the Mission Park
Association that Oakwood street be
extended through from Eighteenth to
Nineteenth was referred to the Bud
get Committee. George Walcom.
president of the association, said the
street was worse than any in China
town at present.
The Finance Committee notified the
Health Board that proceedings in the
matter of cleaning Chinatown will
cease from now on with the exception
that two men will be employed to kill
rats.
The Budget Committee will meet
Thursday afternoon to take up the es
timates of the Civil Service, Electric
ity and Health Commissions and on
Friday afternoon to consider the bud
get of the Works and Park commis
sions.
The petition of property owners
that a sewer be constructed from
Burnside avenue, the entrance to
Glen Park, in the ditch that now runs
through the Gum ranch to the South
ern Pacific Railroad culvert, to take
the sewage from the Mission and
Thirtieth street extension, Sunnyside,
Castro-street Addition, Glen Park
terrace, Fairmount and a new school
site was referred to the Street Com
mittee.
The petition of the College District
Improvement Association that a fire
engine house be established on Ash
bury Heights was referred to the Bud
get Committee. Reference is made to
the fact that on April 30. 1904, a dis
astrous fire took place on the heights
named, burning ten houses, at a loss
of $50,000, and that it takes the Fire
Department ten minutes to reach the
heights.
The City Attorney filed a statement
that he would require $22,100 for
salaries in his office during the next
fiscal year; $2500 for stationery; $16,
000 for expenses in defense of the
Spring Valley Water Company's litiga
tion, and $6500 for miscellaneous ex

The Outdoor Art League of Califor
nia yesterday petitioned the Supervis
ors to submit again the proposition tfl
issue bonds for the purchase of landÂ»
necessary to preserve Telegraph Hill
from destruction. The league's reso
lution on the subject recites that the
hill, both from an esthetic and com
mercial standpoint, is of inestimable
value to the city. The proposition
failed to carry the necessary votes at
a previous election. The petition \va?
referred to the Utilities Committee.
The petition of the Merchants' As
sociation that an appropriation be
made to provide the city with a com
plete system of street signs, in accord
ance with suggestions of the Adorn
ment Association, was referred to th<r
Finance Committee. The petition n -
cites that it is difficult for many tour
ists to find their way cm account al
the entire lack of signs In some parts,
of the city. The sum of $1500 will bt.
expended at once for the purpose.
The resolution directing the City At
torney to commence an action to en
join the Globe Grain and Milling Com
pany, John Center, Pennlngttm Broth
ers and all parties interested from ex
ploding blasts on Chestnut street, be
tween Kearny and Montgomery and on
Winthrop street, between Chestnut and
Lombard, from removing any rock
therefrom and from excavating so as
to cause any part of the streets named
to cave away and be reduced below
grade was deferred one week.
The petition of the Globe Milling
Company for permission to blast in
Chestnut street, between Montgomery
and Kearny, was referred to the Street
Committee.
Ordinances were passed to print pro
viding for the conditional acceptance
of Birch avenue, from Van Ness av
enue westerly; Hugo street, between
Second and Third avenues, and for the
full acceptance of Florida street, be
tween Twenty-fourth and Twenty
fifth.
Grades were ordered changed on
Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth and Thirty
flrst avenues at A, B and C streets and
Point Lobos avenue. Array street, be
tween Guerrero and Dolores; Holly
Park avenue and West Park street.
A large number of demands for re
bate of schools and hospital taxes of
1902 were ordered paid on authority of
Auditor Baehr.
Demands were drawn in favor of
Andrew Lynch, Philip Hilberer. J. D.
Hoist and Mary Wenzel for property
conveyed to the city for the Park and
Presidio Extension.
Bids for printing the delinquent tax
list were opened from the Star at 2%
cents per name, the Evening Port at
10 cents and the Weekly Post at 19
cents.
The Finance Committee informally
discussed the advisability of the city's
taking aver the Geary-street road.
D'Ancona said that in view of the
fact that the United Railroads refuses
to put an underground electric system
on the Sutter and Pacific avenue sys
tem it might be to the advantage of
the city to operate the Geary-street
road as an up-to-date electric system.
The committee decided that serious
thought would be given to the matter
when the budget was being considered.
The availability of the funds and the
amount at the disposal of the commit
tee will be important factors in the
final disposition of the matter.
After the board adjourned a persis
tent attorney asked Brandenateln why
some action was not being taken to
pass the demands of Edward Graney
for shoeing horses of the Fire Depart
ment. Brandenstein said he would not
take the matter up if the attorney per
sisted in making threats as to what
he intended to do. Finally Branden
stein said the demands would be con
sidered by the Finance Committee next
Monday.
