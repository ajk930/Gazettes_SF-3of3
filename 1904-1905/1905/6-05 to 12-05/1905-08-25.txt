PORTSMOUTH, Jf. H., Ang. 24. The
proapectb of pence aeem desperate, but
tbey are not hopeless, despite tbe pre
vailing; pessimism. There la still a
dutnce, and tbe forces work in k for
peace are continuing their labors. Tbe
President failed twice, but he Is n^Sit-
Injj on. The result of Erabasaador
)lpjrr> audience at Peterbof yesterday
f\uu unsatisfactory* but at least It was
not a rebuff. It left the door open,
and within a lew hours after the re
celpt at Oyster Bay of Mr. Meyer's ac
count of his audience tbe President
bad sent a new appeal, through Mr. de
Witte, who received It from 3lr. Pelrce
at 3 o'clock this morning;.
Tbe Emperor, had already, in effect,
declined the proposed compromise of
fered by Japan. He had refused it be
cause, under a disguise, Japan of
fered to withdraw an article asking for
remuneration for the cost of the war. on
condition that Russia repurchase from
the? military possession of Japan the
â¢ northern portion of Saghalien- at "a
"'"Cxef! prlce^^l^^OO^OQO^xqn^.he^es
tizaK.-t^a " ffuTi de guerre/*
Every message received from Peter
hof. including those that came, early to
day, was inflexible upon that point.
Had Japan not inserted the sum, had
that been left for future adjustment,
the proposition undoubtedly would
have proved more palatable. And the
divergence in the compromise, as sug
gested by the President and as offered
by Japan at the conference, which was
mentioned in these dispatches .last
night, touched this very point.
COMPROMISE TAMPERED WITH.
The President did not suggest a price
or the fixing of a price, and it is be
lieved, although this cannot be af
firmed, that his latest effort was to se
cure the consent of the Emperor to
agree to accept the Japanese proposi
tion with the amount subject to fur
ther adjustment by an arbitration board
or otherwise. 'â¢" . '. â¢

"Witte has already offered to divide Sag
halien. If the repurchase of Saghalien
was based upon a purchasable basis, the
following lines from the authorized state
ment of the Russian position ' given last
night should be borne in mind:
"All that Japan does is to join the ques
tion of Saghalien with that of a cash
payment and to insist .upon war costs
under the name of purchase money. The
transaction is fictitious and the termin
ology misleading.. If what is proposed
be in truth a purchase and sale, it should
be treated as. such, and, therefore, should
Russia decline to buy the territory, Ja
pan should keep it and conclude peace
on the basis of the concessions already
made."
JAPAN MAY MAKE CONCESSION.
Japan, it is believed, would make the
farther concessions suggested, if Em
peror Nicholas would commit himself to
this solution. This statement is based
on the words of the Japanese authority
. most competent to speak. When asked
If It was correct, as reported, that the
Japanese had said their last word and
that all hope was over, he replied:
"No, we have not declared that 'â¢ our
proposition of Wednesday was our irre
ducible minimum; We are not assuming
a threatening attitude. That is not .the
way to make peace."
But the plenipotentiaries themselves no
longer control on either side. The ne
gotiations have * passed ' from . their, hands
to their principals at Peterhof and Toklo.
KAISER UNDER SUSPICION.
Most persistently the report continues
to be circulated here that Emperor Wll->
Ham has teen one of the main obstacles
to oeace: thvt, while ostensibly in sym
pathy with the President's efforts, he is
advising Emperor Nicholas not -to yield.
The foundation for. the belief Is the fact,
which appears . fully confirmed, that ' Mr.
de Witte' s Instructions ; were made more
Imperative and lntransigeant ' upon the
question of Indemnity and cession of
territory after the Kaiser's Interview
with the Russian Emperor In the Gulf of
Finland. Beyond this, no evidence is of
fered.
It is significant that Mr. de Witte made
It a point to express his disbelief in the
report from St. Petersburg, which caused
\u25a0 considerable consternation here. , that
Count Lamsdorff had authorized, Reu
ter*B agent to declare that Russia under
no circumstances would pay' a contribu
tion, Â«ith*>.r direct or indirect, or. make a
cession of territory whatever. Mr. de
Witte said* he" could' not imagine that
. Count Lamsdorff could have authorized
such a statement without informing " him
(de Wltte).

NEWPORT, R. 1., Aug. 24.â After col
liding with and damaging vie little kero^
sene oil schooner N. S. Gallup of New
York the battleship Kearsargo arrived
In the harbor to-night with the disabled
craft and her crew of two. The warship
was not Injured and the loss to the owner
of the, schooner, the National Oil Com
pany of- New York, does not exceed JoOO.
The battleship squadron went out for
maneuvers this afternoon between Point
Judith and Newport, but was obliged to*
head for this port at noon because of a
dense fog. At a point flve miles south
east of Point Judith-the Gallup, which
was bound from New York to Ports
mouth, R. 1., with a cargo of empty oil
barrels below and filled casks on deck,
crossed the bow of the battleship. The
latter, steaming at the rate of five knots,
struck the schooner oni the starboard sida ,
below the water line. The /water which
poured in through a hole a foot square
soon filled the Gallup and caused her, to
capsize.
The only persons on board were Cap-,
tain John Andrews and his son William.
They were rescued.
FEVER PLAGUE
UNDER CONTROL
* To-day these developments began to
appear. A report from Kmbassador
Meyer at -St. Petersburg of his audi
ence with Emperor Nicholas was re
ceived, and in addition some important
advices from Portsmouth reached the
President. They were regarded as so
virgont that as soon as they_ were re
ceived in the* executive office in the
village they were carried to Sagamore
â¢ Hill by a trusted executive clerk.
The utmost secrecy -is maintained re
gu:ding the communications, not the
63ightfsi intimation of. the nature of
| their contents being permitted to' be
como "public.
" It lsÂ«qufte certain that in addition
to making a direct appeal to the Rus
sian Emperor to tiike sdeh measures
as may bring the pending negotiations
to a successful issue, President Roose-.
vclt has communicated with the Jap
anese Oovf rnment along similar lines.
Whether that appeal was made direct
ly to the Emperor of Japan, as in the
case of Kmperov Nicholas, cannot be
ascertained, as no official confirmation
is giveu of the statement that such a
communication has been forwarded.
An impression is likely to be created
by some recent reports of the Presi
dent's activity in the peace proceedings
that he is exerting the powerful influ
ence wields to force the envoys into
some sort of an agreement. N T o such |
impression is warranted by the efforts
he has made. Kroia the incipiency of
the Negotiations the President -has been J
actuated by motives, of the 6incerest '
friendship for. both of the belligerents
and by a desire to do all that in him |
lies to terminate a conflict so sangul- j
nary that it has shocked the entire, civ
ilized world. In the identical note]
which he directed to the St. Petersburg !
and Tokio Governments, he expressed -|
the hope that their representatives !
might' come together and settle their ]
differences themselves. Since the en- j
voys assembled in America, in an ef- j
fort to carry out the President's sug- j
gx-stion, he has followed' ln spirit and j
â in principle the ideas he enunciated in
his identical note.
In the negotiations preliminary " to
the conference the President acted in j
the capacity *of an intermediary .' be- |
tween Russia and Japan. When, the
plenipotentiaries arrived In America
and were received by the President he ;
assured them that they would be free '
absolutely from interference in their !
deliberations. iHe made it clear to
them at the same time that if he could
be of. any assistance to them an the
accomplishment of their great mission,
that assistance would be extended
.gladly in any proper effort to solve
their differences. ,
The President's offer ras appreciat
ed to the fullest by the c,;iferrees, and
"later they availed themselves of It.
Moved by a profound desire to restore
peace, the President has lent his good
offices to the representatives of both
the warring powers, but he has re
" Grained from any effort which might be
regarded as offensive either by Russia
or Japan.
ful that' such t-fforts as he has felt it
proper to make to avÂ«rt a failure of tiie
Washington conference might not be
futile.
"Vladivostok," he says, "is a. year's
task at least, and more- expensive than
Port Arthur." . ' . ; .
This attache noticed during a trip
through Russia, from -which he has just,
returned, that, the southern- fortresses
were practically denuded of heavy
artillery, which has been emplaced at
the approaches to the fortress at Vladi
vostok. \u25a0'\u25a0 V \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0*â¢ -â¢\u25a0â¢ - :

that the city of Moscow, grenadiers

A competent military attache of a
Euoprean power, -who is acquainted
thoroughly with the defensive facili
ties of Vladivostok, says that. the Jap
anese will find that fortress a harder
nut to crack than Port Arthur, if they
decide to break off negotiations. This
uuthoiity declares that the Japanese
fleet will not be able .to co-operate with
the attacking army except in the way

Germany has thus far approved the
French demands for redress, . but fears
are expressed in some quarters that the
Sultan will refuse to yield, in the* hope
of securing the aid of' Germany. . Practi
cally all the leading powers have .ap
proved the determination . of j the : French
Government to adopt a firm course.
The demonstration, as planned, is some
what similar to that which an American
squadron made at Tangier to compel ; the
release of lon Perdicarls, who was cap
tured by. the bandit Raisull. The French
authorities deemed a naval demonstration
inexpedient owing to possible \ interna
tional complications resulting from other
nations sending warships to observe the
demonstration, while a military move
ment against â¢ Morocco would be largely
of a police measure, not involving the
general political question of French au
thority in Morocco. The, persistent re
fusal of the Sultan to yield, however,
might compel France to advance farther
than a border town.
It is the intention of the military au
thorities to occupy ' a Moroccan border
town, probably Oudjda, owing to - its
strategic command of the route 'to the
Moroccan capital.' However, the officials
are confident that the Sultan will yield
before the threat of using military
force. - â¢ , '
Instructions were sent to the French
Minister at Fez. Strene Tallandier, to
make a final and imperative demand on
the Sultan. The Minister was informed
that If this demand should' be refused,
the entire personnel of the : legation : was
to depart from Morocco and a military
movement would simultaneously be be
gun along the "Algerian frontier.
PARIS, Aug. 24.â As the result of a
special meeting of the Council ofJ Min
isters to-day, it was announced that la
military demonstration will .be made
against Morocco unless the - Sultan
promptly, j'ield to the French demands for
the release ;of the French-Algerian citi
zen, a merchant named Bouzian, who
was unjustifiably arrested at GharbT"a

day in the Taggart divorce case, black
ening Captain Taggart's character with
lurid stories of his life in Manila, auuX
of his doings with Augustina de- la
Cruz, .the Fllipln\> woman. Almost at
the beginning of the trial this samÂ©
Emma connected Mrs. Taggart's name
In no uncertain terms with that of
Captain Bash.' .. ,
It is believed that Mrs. Taggart will
be the next witness called, although
her attorneys said that she would
hardly be called .before Friday after
noon or' Saturday morning. '...,.
Mr 3. Little took the stand to-day.
She said she knew Captain. Bash and
wa3 present on the evening when Cap
i tain .Taggart came in from a drive and
I swore at Bash. She said .that one
evening . Taggart came home' so drunk
that he dW not know anything and
Mrs. Taggart shoved him into the par
lor and he laid down on* Major New-,
berry's bed. ' , . / ' . â¢
At Fort Leavenworth on the night of
June 30 at about 11 o'clock Taggart
went downstairs and locked the door
and came~"back and said to. the witness:
"There are a bunch of officers com
ing. They are drunkâ^don't let ; them
in." '
Before long Mrs. Taggart came horn*,
but could not awaken any one and
went back to the Poores' house. The)
captain . called up by telephone and
asked if he should send an ambulance I
after her.' She came in a short time
after and the captain went . down and
let her in. As soon as she stepped In
side the door he grabbed her. swore at
her, tore oft . her clothing and then
shoved her out the door, exclaiming:
"Go to the gutter, where you be
long!"
. Then. said. the witness, he pulled her
back into the house and beat and
kicked her until finally their son Cul
ver came down and interfered. -WÂ£R
Mrs. Little said - that Taggart was
drunk, all the time while in Manila, but
not so drunk that he could not attend

CHICAGO, " Aug. ! 24.â The detectives
of Assistant Chief of Police Schuetter's
murder squad in seeking a solution of
the; murder of Mrs. Elizabeth F. Mize,
the wealthy New York widow, who was
shot : and; killed \>y a ?hold-up man in
a fashionable part \u25a0 of Hyde Park, have
now. reached the conclusion that Mrs.
Mize was killed-: by mistake and that
the bullet which ended . her life ; was
intended for her companion, Mrs. F. A.
Wilson. -
. : Ift the absence of any. direct proof
against .William Bracey, the negro
waiter, who, Mrs. Wilson positively de-~
claredlto-day, .wasnot. the man who
shot; down her companion, the; police
are seeking for a plausible motive "for
the : crime. In their J investigation .they
say they have learned that Mrs. .Wilson
had .been a. heavy patron' of the book
makers and had become involved in a
financial dispute with one of them. She
is said 7 , to have'- lost "a considerable sum
on the; races, and it is' asserted by the
police she threatened the 'arrest, and
prosecution of a' certain bookmaker un
less he made restitution of her losses.
The police believe it was 'this "book
maker, who sought Mrs. Wilson at .the
Del Prado Hotel and later /followed her
in her, walk | in the evening, and accost
ed her in ;. Washington avenue. In sub
stantiation of this -theory the police
point to the: fact that Mrs., Wilson ran
the moment she faced, the man who
accosted. her : and >Mrs. Mize. They say
that the man, mistaking Mrs. Mire for
Mrs^ Wilson, began to argue with ' her
and shot her, believing her to be Mrs.
Wilson. The detectives at work .on
this phase of the case have been un
able to secure any information from
Mrs.' Wilson herself. , She has given the
police only meager accounts.

near Wildwood. six miles from this city,
and all waded waist deep ashore and
found relief at a summer cottage.

PARTY OF CAMPERS
LOST IN SWAMPS
Poy was walking along-Ross alley at
about 7 o'clock in the evening when two
highbinders stepped out of a doorway,
and one of them fired point blank into
the victim's head. The bullet entered his
right temple and he fell face forward to
the street. To be sure of their prey they
Â«tood over their victim and fired two
more shots at Poy as- he lay lifeless on
the sidewalk. One of them entered his
back and the other penetrated his hand.
The highbinders made their escape
through a pawnshop nearby. Detective
McMahon, Sergeant Ross and Policeman
George Downey were on the scene a few
minutes afterward. It was evident that
the plot was well laid as the homicides
made good their escape. The only evi
dence left behind was the 44-caliber re
volver which was used to do the deed.
Poy lived with his mother and Bister at
7*2 Washington street, and was 26 years
old. He was considered one of the most
desperate highbinders and had been one
of the ringleaders In many tong wars that
have occurred in the Chinese quarter for
the last eight years. He was a member
of the Suey Sing Tong for many years
until a few months ago, when he and
twenty other highbinders were expelled .
from the organization.
The police believe he was murdered by
Suey Sing Tong highbinders. Though
they called a meeting last night and of
fered a reward for his slayers it is
thought that this is done to mislead the
police. He recently testified for the prose
cution in a case the Educational Society i
was prosecuting and this is believed to
have led to his death.
In March 5. ISOO. in the trouble with the
Buey Sings and Sing Lucy Yings. Poy was
a ringleader. A Sing man was killed by
a Ying highbinder and a suspect was ar
rested. He was afterward released on
bail. The Suey Sings suspected Tuck Wo,
a Jackson street pawnbroker, as having
furnished the bail money. Wo was killed
shortly afterward and Poy was suspected
of having done the deed.
In March 29, 1901, Poy and another high- "
binder, Quan Vim, fought a pitched bat
tle with Low Ying and Low Sing on
Baker alley, in which fifty shots were ex
changed, but no one was wounded. Poy
was accused of having shot at Yup Sing
last January. *
The police have connected him with nu
merous murders in Chinatown, but were
unable to convict him. Invariably when
a good case was against \u25a0â¢ him the wit
nesses were bought off and would leave
the city or refuse to testify.
Louie Poy, one or the most desperate
and feared highbinders in Chinatown, was
ehot and instantly killed last night in Ross
alley near Jackeon street by highbinders.
The murderers had their plans well laid
and made their escape without leaving a
clew.

To-nigtit a grand banquet was held
Â«.t the Casino roof garden, overlooking
the bay. The tables were beautifully
decorated, and the menu was a fine one.
Special I>lEÂ»ateh to ThÂ« Call.
Chairman George B. .Barstow pre
sented the report of the nominating
committee, naming the following offi
cers for the ensuing year: George C.
Pardee;- California, president; L. W.
Shurtliff, Utah, flrst vice president; K.
H. Stephens, Texas, second vice presi
dent; H. D. Maxon, Nevada; secretary.
A motion to adopt the report of the
committee on resolutions was followed
by the introduction of an amendment
to a resolution indorsing the present
reclamation law, especially those pro
visions which afford an opportunity
for home-making. This amendment ad
vocated a repeal of that portion of the
national irrigution law which com
pels the disposal of any acreage in ex
cess of 160 acres to one land-holder.
The motion was bitterly attacked by
the supporters of the small land hold
ers, and after a spirited debate the
amendment was defeated and the report
was adopted as presented. \u25a0 Â« "
The congress expresses a high appre
ciation of the present, national irriga
tion law, commend especially its bene
ficient provisions for home-making,
'and urges the speedy completion of the
Government projects now under con
struction.
In order, to remedy the unsatisfactory
provision of the constitution of the
congress which compels it to conduct
its deliberations in sectional meetings
the constitution was amended so as to
provide for a general session each
day during the convention .of the con
gress, but the congress may, if it deem
best, aslo conduct sectional meetings.
The chairman of the nominating
committee to which was referred the
matter of the \u25a0 selection of a nominee
for a secretary announced that his
committee had finally : unanimously
agreed on Maxon. A spasmodic' i at
tempt to defeat Maxon was nipped in
the bud, and the committee's report as
submitted was adopted.
When the matter of selecting a
meeting-place for the next congress
came up invitations were tendered by
Chicago, Denver, Spokane and Boise,
Idaho. Chicago's invitation was not
seconded, and Spokane was withdrawn
in favor of Boise. After an hour of
oratory Denver withdrew, and Boise,
alone in the field, was named as the
convention city for 1906.
The reports of the chairman of the
different sections were submitted, and
with an expression of gratitude to the
citizens of Ogden, who sent their Mor
mon choir of 225- voices to Portland in
honor of the congress, the thirteenth
annual session became an event of the
Curtis' paper was followed by the
reading of a letter to the congress from
President James ,J. Hill of the Great
Northern Railway and the submitting
of committee reports. Hill's letter was
read by B. W. Eberlln of San Fran
cisco, who wiÂ« introduced by Governor
Pardee of California, to the congress.
Governor Pardee said that Mr. Hill was
unable to appear before the congress in
person owing to the serious illness of
Mrs. Hill.
This session of the congress is im
portant for the pronounced stand as
sumed on three subjects.
It declared emphatically that Its
sympathy is with the small land owner
agalnÃt the large landed proprietors
who seek to have the national irriga
tion law so amended as to permit the
retention of more than 160 acres of ir
rigated land.
The congress also expressed the
opinion that Government enterprise in
the work of reclaiming arid . lands
should not unnecessarily interfere with
previous private enterprise, nor private
enterprise with poior Government
projects.
Finally it expressed disapproval of
the repeated attempts to inject the sub
ject of undesirable foreign immigra
tion into its ! deliberations, contending
that this subject is one in which the
congress, as a body, is not interested.
Before the consideration of the busi
ness of the congress the submission of
reports, election of officers and selec
tion of next year's meeting place, Wil
liam E. Curtis of Chicago made an ad
dress on the subject of "Irrigation in
India." .Curtis' paper \u25a0 was a descrip
tion of the irrigation projects institut
ed by the British Government.
PORTLAND. Aug. 24.â After an in
teresting session which consumed the
entire day the thirteenth annual meet
ing of the National Irrigation Congress

would be the case if these drugs

to-day. Mrs. A. W/ McÃae, wife of a

he will \u25a0 die and at least three other -men
were badly hurt by the - explosion.
; Paris is not connected by telephone with

From . the: fact "that Mrs. McÃae and her
child were killed., it 'is presumed the ex

it resulted from a quantity of giant pow
der stored: near the: family residence.
Word of the disaster was sent across the

STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Aug. 24. â At a

Minister of Justice Berger presented a
report on the decision of the Nor

mal opening of negotiations with Sweden
for the dissolution of the union. At the
same time he proposed that King Oscar
be requested to empower the Council
to enter Into negotiations with the Nor

of the questions In. dispute and also to
authorize the Government to appoint
delegates to meet the Norwegian rep

On the recommendation of the Coun
cil, the Regent, Crown Prince Gustave,
gave his consent to the proposal.
According to good authority the feel
ing in Government circles regarding
the accession . by a Bernadotte Prince
to the Norwegian throne has undergone

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 24.â The State
Board' of Equalization .to-day voted on
the motion of Controller B. P. Colgan
to ; accept ' the ; figures returned by,, all
county auditors for. the basis of fixing
the tax | rate. . This action 5 came after â¢ a
motion to cite Los Angeles ; County,' made
by Equalizer W. H.Alford yesterday, had
been renewed and' lost, Alford z and ;R,
H. Beamer voting Vaye" and Chairman
Alexander Brown, Controller Colgan and
F. H. Mattlson voting *'no."
Mattlson sought to amend Alford's mo
tion by Including San . Francisco In : the
citation with Los Angeles, but * Alford
raised the point of- order ; that to cite
San v Francisco a separate motion j would
have to be made. Chairman \ Brown held
the point of order to be well taken, and
Alford's motion then went to a vote, with
the result stated. . ' ; .
In voting against thjp motion to â¢ cite
Los Angeles, Brown , said .he was 1 not
satisfied with the showing made by Los
Angeles when Its representatives ; were
before the board seeking a reduction of
25 per cent In the assessment levied <by
Assessor "Ward. The Los Angeles repre-,
sentatlves had asked that if that county
was to be cited they be given five days'
notice in order to present their case. -This
convinced him, Mr. Brown said, that Los
Angeles would send the strong delega
tion it uaually sends out' when It. wants
anything, and would; make a far better
showing than had been made at the hear
ing yesterday and the day before. In the
limited time left In -which to conduct
the hearing, -Brown said it .would be im
possible to get at all the facts and a
citation against Lob Angeles would be of
no avail.
; When the motion . to cite Los Angeles
was lost, Mattlson made no, attempt to
cite San Francisco, and Colgan's motion
to accept all auditors' \ figures carried
unanimously. /'
Beamer said he believed ..that the show
ing , made by Assessor Ward was hinged
on Assessor. Dodge of ,'San Francisco,
and did ; not reflect the . true conditions
with respect to Los Angeles and San
Francisco. Dodge's claim that Los
Angeles was assessed at; only 35, per cent
of. selling values /was- too low, and his
further claim that' he T (Dodge) had assess
ed San Francisco : properties at 65 per
cent, was too high. V . \u25a0'. . :X .
Although the tax levy cannot be of
ficially made, under/ the law, , until some
time between the first and second Mon
day in September, probably September 5,
the rate will; be forty-nine cents on the
|100 ' of assessable property. .
The gross valuation of all county valu
ations Is $1,555,737,727, which, with railroad
assessments of $69,820,186, give a total of
$1,625,557,913." " ' V ' ' ' '
From . this amount must be deducted
5 per cent for delinquencies and $1,940,940
for State University mortgages,' which
leaves A $1,542,339,078 on which â¢to base the
tax, levy.
The general fund 'will require $4,000,000;
the school fund $2,851,786; the high school
fund $217,335, arid . the Interest and sink-
Ing fund $141,435, making a total of $7,210,
556 to be raised, which gives aâ¢. rate ; of
forty-seven cents. 4 To this must be added
the fixed '- rate of ; two cents on : the $100
of property for : the further { support of
the State University, which makes the
rate forty-nine cents In all. i \u25a0>

Question of Eelatiye Value

MOTION BY GOLGAN
SETTLES DISPUTE
Seldom has a total eclipse . of . the sun
been bo efficiently prepared for as on the
present occasion, for that of August' SO,
and numerous are the alms of the pros
pective observers. Of these alma, few are
more Interesting than a distinct view of
the outer corona, and fortunately in a
cloudless eky no observation Is more
easily obtained.
This eclipse will be a timely test of the
nearly established theory of the Interde
pendence of sunspots and coronal stream
ers. The records of forty-five years yield
atrong evlaence that when an eclipse oc
curs during the maximum period of Bpot
tedness, coronal extensions are distribut
ed at poles, epot xones and midway Indis
criminately, giving a general appearance;
of roundness to the luminous phenome
non; that the minimum period reveals
streamers concentrated at the 6pot zones,
while the polar arcs are conspicuously
fringed with short rays; and the Inter
mediate stage of eolar activity indicates j
co-operation by a limited display of short '
polar rays, and an avoidance of the
axial tracts by the longer branches, \
which often project midway between \u25a0
poles and epot zonea; giving a square as
pect to the halo.
The extraordinary size and frequency
of eolar eruptions during this present
maximum will add much to the value of
the forthcoming evidence. Though the
position of prominences with regard to
eunstorms and coronal structure Is of
deep interest. Investigation as to coronal
change Is at a more conclusive stage.
Bhould polar rays and epot zone stream
ers glimmer out in the path of totality,
the testimony of the minima eclipses of
1567. 1878, ISSS end 1900 will be seriously
undermined; and the long polar exten
sions of ISS3 and four previous maxlna
eclipses will lose their significance.
The low altitude of the sun in Labra
dor and Africa may Interfere with, clear
views of the crucial outer effulgence, but
by a- fortunate chance several colleges
and observatories are. located in the des
tined track of the lunar shadow through
Spain. As totality takes place before 1
p. m. when the sun's altitude Is about
45 degrees, and lasts three and one-half
minutes, that country has been the goal
of skilled observers from all directions.
Widespread cloudiness alone can hinder
advance in at least the" simpler problems
of the sun's surroundings.; The time-hon
ored ditty, "Rain! Rain! go to Spain,"
will be earnestly negatived these days by
all who understand the dampening effect
of cloudy weather on eclipse research.

BAD STOMACH
MAKES BAD BLOOD.
Yon can't make sweet batter in a foul
chnra. Erery fanner's wife knows this.
Yoor stomach churns and digests the
food you eat, and If foul, torpid or out of
order, your whole system suffer* from
blood poisoning. You will have foul
breath, coated tongue, bad taste, poor
appetite and a whole train of disagree-
able symptoms. Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery, which is not a bever-
age composed of whisky or alcohol, being
entirely free from lntoxicanta, Is a great
reanlator and lnvlgorator of . the Stom-
ach, Liver and Bowels.
Â« About % year aso I was 111 with blood pol-
eoninf ." writes Miss Eveline Louis, of 69
Walter Street, Buffalo. N. Y. Â«I had what
teemed to be a small cold sore on my lip. It
became very amrry In appearanoe and beran -
to ssread until it nearly covered ay face. I
was a frightful sUrbt and could not go out-
side the house because of my appearanoe. I
used a blood medicine which did not Â«1tÂ«
xne any relief. Then I t>efiran to take your
â¢Golden Medical Discovery.* I was Â«TeÂ«tly
benefited with the first bottle and aftÂ«r tak-,
in* the second bottle was completely cured.
The crrslpelatous eruption disappeared and
ray blood was cleansed. My complexion, is.
dear and fresh and I have felt better this
year than I did for some time before. Dr.
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery Is cer-
tainly a most remarkable medicine. 1 ' \u25a0
Don't accept a substitute for a medicine
which performs euch cures and which has
a uniformly successful record of; nearly
forty rears to its credit. It' 6 an Insult to
your Intelligence for a dealer to try by
over-persuasion to palm off upon you in
it 9 stead some . inferior article with no
record . to back It up. You know what
you want; it is his business to meet that
want.

NEW. YORK, Aug. 24.â Incensed by lack
of attention In a well-known uptown res
taurant last night, a man of athletic- mold,
who said he was Colonel Tazewell Ellett
of Richmond, Va.. gave battle to sev
eral waiters and caused a stampede of
diners to the street. Police who inter
fered were badly mauled by the colonel
and It required the joint efforts of five
bluecoats to land him in the station.
Just what started the fight .is not
known. The. unusual noise attracted a
large crowd around the doors and the
police had to force their way In. They
found the irate colonel chasing the
waiters In all directions. He was dragged
to the sidewalk, .and. on reaching Broad
way, he turned on his captors, knock-
Ing down four of them in quick succes
sion. Reserves were called and ,the pris
oner was soon overpowered by the rein
forcements. -;:-^ ;:_;â¢;-.: \u25a0-, .
August H. Gerstmann, grocer at 517
Polk street. Is a brave man. Poet Ten
nyson's fling at the shopkeeper does
not at' all apply to him, for August
stood a counterfefter and ex-convict at
bay at the muzzle of a revolver last
Wednesday night and held him a.pris
oner until a policeman came along; and
took the criminal away.
On the night mentioned Gerstmann
was alone in his store, when a stranger
came in and asked for $1 worth of
sugar. When the package was handed
him he passed to the grocer what pur
ported to be a %'Zd silver certificate.
Gerstmann. had seen that kind of a bill
before and recognized it as a $1 silver
certificate raised to one of $20 denom
ination by pasting in the figures and
tetters of the $20 designation of a
Confederate note. The grocer made no
remark, but took his revolver from be
hind the counter, walked between tha
stranger and the door, covered him
with the weapon and forced him Into
the back 'room. Then he summoned
Policeman C. F. Francis, who took the
stranger into custody.
United States Secret Service Agent
Thomas B. Foster identified the pris
oner as William Green (alias' William
Breen, alias Fred Wilson), a graduate
of the Whittier Reform School and an
ex-convlct. who had served a term of
six years' imprisonment In the peniten
tiary for burglary. He was placed in
custody of the United States Marshal.
"I am not guilty of this horrible mur
der," he said, "and now , I will have the
opportunity of proving myself Innocent
before, the highest court In the State.
I never felt that I would go to the gal
lows. I may be guilty of other crimes,
but never of, that of murder."
CHICAGO, Aus. 21.â Johann Hoch," the
man of. 'many wives, convicted of the
murder of one of them, and under sentence
of death, has escaped the gallows a third
time. He. was to have been hanged here
to-morrow, but a supersedeas â¢. was Issued
to-day on an order of Justice Magruder
of the Supreme Court. The Justice said
that" he had carefully examined the rec
ord presented by Hoch's attorneys and his
stirtly of it satisfied him there was enough
doubt to justify a review it the entire
case- by the Supreme Court. The case
will, come up at the October term of the
court at Springfield, 111.
\ Hocht has been -confident that the death
sentence would not be executed. He had
very little to say when informed of the

ence'that a prisoner has exhibited no con
cern about his fate the day , previous : to

William Hogan created a scene in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday when
he appeared for trial on a charge of
burglary. The case had been on the
calendar for trial for nearly a month,
the defendant obtaining continuances
from time to time on the pretext that
he did not have counsel. The Judge
Bald the case Ttould have to go to trial
and he appointed Attorney Hornblower
to represent the defendant.
Hogan stood up in the dock and in
a loud voice said: "I know my rights.
I don't want Hornblower and you're
not going to railroad me to jail. I
know my rights and I am going to
have them. I want my own attorney.''
The Judge told Bailiff Welch to take
Hogan out of the courtroom and con
tinued the case till 1* o'clock.
At - o'clock Attorney Hornblower
asked for a continuance till this morn-
Ing, as the defendant had Informed him
that his brother would reach the city
in the evening with money to pay for
an attorney of his own selection.
The Judge granted the continuance, j
but sai4 that the case would have to j
go to trial this morning. Hbgan apol- j
egized for his "discourteous words" in I
the morning, saying he was excited at
the time, but the Judge paid no at
tention to him. There are two prior
convictions against him for burglary.

Mayor Schmltz. \u25a0 The* county 1 committee
of the party, Thomas F. Eagan chairman
and George J. Berger secretary, met last
night and adopted these resolutions:
The v giafters fully realize the 'fact that
a coalition of Republican and Demo
cratic forces in â¢ this campaign for a re
demption of San Francisco will result in
the overthrow of the Ruef-Schmitz ad
ministration, hence It Is expected that
the grafters' alliance will promise any
thing and everything to prevent the
regular conventions of the two leading
political parties from putting in the field
a joint nominee for Mayor. '\u25a0 .'-\u25a0\u25a0-."_. '-\u25a0\u25a0-. "_
The League delegations controlling .the
Republican municipal convention are firm
and true. -There is not the slightest sign
of weakness or treachery in any delega
tion. When the- proper time arrives a
caucus of the majority will be called. In
the selection of a- nominee for Mayor
Ruef will not be consulted. In caucus the
nominee : will be indorstd. The list of.
available and acceptable V me^i for t the
Mayoralty Is quite extensive, embracing
&uch names as Fred Koster, , John C.
Kirkpatrick, Albert Castle, H. D. Love
land; Charles W. Slack,- W. G. Stafford,
K. J. Taussig, John Liickmanu, Daniel A.
Ryan, Harry Baehr and James v.McNab.
The Ruefters have failed in their efforts
to detach' delegates from* the column of
the San Francisco Republican . League
and are now working diligently -and
adroitly to prevent coalition of the Re
publican and Democratic forces. , There
Is said, to be convincing proof in the pos
session of the League that Ruef made an
offer of a West Point cadetship to a Re
publican delegate ' provided the latter
would' vote and work against th^ proposi
tion to coalesce with the Democrats., The
officers of the -League -did not setia trap
for Ruef, but when they received infor
mation that the boss was promising Fed
eral patronage to bolster up the cam
paign of graft they did; not advise.^"re
jection of his proposal, preferring that
the boss should' go' ahead and disclose
the' identity 'of the United States .Sena
tor or Representative 'in Congress who
had patronage to place in this kind of a
pool. It is claimed that Ruef offered to
show down and produce the man who
would deliver the cadetship.
â¢It is just possible that some member of
the California Congressional delegation
might have recognized , Ruef in days gone
by as a Republican and promised him a
cadetship, but in the light of current po
litical events in San Francisco the prom
ise. cannot be made good. Staunch Re
publicans of the California delegation
will closely watch all' tne recommenda
tions . for cadetships at, Annapolis and
West Point and eliminate Ruef deals.
TJie California Theater will reopen next
Sunday night under the management of
Manager Charles P. Hall, who controls
the syndicate theaters in Oakland, Stock
ton. Sacramento and other interior cities.
The season at the California is to be
devoted to the new "burlesque wheel,"
which Is to last for forty weeks.
The "burlesque wheel" is made up of
seventy-five companies, each one num
bering from thirty-five to sixty people,
and each company will travel all over
ihe United States, thus giving each the
ater on the circuit a new company and
play each week of the entire season.
The burlesquers will be seen In an
up-to-date conception entitled "A Mar
ried Bachelor," which will be gorgeously
costumed and equipped.
Among the prominent features of the
programme will be Yvette, the sensa
tional electrical dancer and physical cul
ture poseur, who created a furore in
Paris this spring. The Kellar Zouave
girls from London will be seen in a
lightning gun drill and evolutions and
daring high-wall climbing, which was the
hit In London last winter. The Mound
City Quartet ranks as one of the best
on the "Â«tage and will be heard with the
company. J. Gaffney Brown Is . al*o to
be seen In his novel digital manipula
tions, known as "Watch the Cigarette."
Prominent In the company are John A.
Boone, May Booth. Charlotte Ivar, Edna
Bruce. May Spencer and other artists.

A VOCABULARY TEST.
WHEN it was necessary to call the attention of the country to
the need and the possibilities of irrigation in the arid and semi
arid regions, it was done by the meeting of the first irrigation
congress in Salt Lake City. That body stuck to its text., It con
sidered only irrigation and subjects naturally impinged upon it. It
was composed largely of practical irrigators, who had no axes to
grind. From that beginning the organization continued until its ob
ject was accomplished in the passage of the Federal irrigation law
and the protection of the irrigable part of the public domain for the
uses of that vast experiment.
Since then the. utility of the congress is questionable. Its name
has been plagiarized by a private organization, which is little less than
a graft, and its discussions have strayed far afield from irrigation.
During its present meeting in Portland the members have said that
this and the last meeting at El Paso have been fizzles. This means
that the natural cause which made the congress necessary no longer
exists. Its work is accomplished and it lingers superfluous on the
stage. Interesting papers upon the various branches of irrigation
have been read at Portland to audiences of twenty-five delegates,
while the rest of the twelve hundred members have been entirely
inattentive. Unless some real utility can be found for it, it is better
that the congress shall cease, rather than continue as the instrument
of purposes entirely foreign to that for which it was created.
Irrigation is no longer to be promoted by mass meeting, nor by
the oratory of non-irrigatprs. It has become a dreadfully practical
matter, worked out by the man and shovel, by the side ditches and
checks, over the growing crops on land that once. was desert. This
man with his hip boots and shovel is watching flowing water and
gopher holes, and sumps and breaks in the ditch, and is not in Port
land listening to orations. He knows more about irrigation than the
finest spellbinder, arid is applying his knowledge. â¢
THE IRRIGATION CONGRESS.
npHE changes of the situation at Kittery Navy Yard are so sud-
I den and acute that no one may say certainly that the issue will
1 he war or peace. The Japanese envoys are now, as in the begin
ning, calm and inscrutable. They have indulged in no yam demon
stration nor idle talk, but have abided by their first position in all
important details, except in the modification suggested by President
Roosevelt. The President has retained control of the situation to a
remarkable degree, and has labored manfully to hold the envoys to
gether-while he exhausts all of the possibilities. But it is said, and
with a strong show of truth, that another is covertly playing against
him, and that other is the Kaiser.
The German is not doing this openly, but covertly. The Presi
dent has toiled in the open as far as Japan and Russia are concerned.
The Kaiser has played his part secretly with one party alone, the
Czar. We had occasion to say recently in connection with Germany's
entrance upon the question of the status of Morocco that that em
pire has ulterior motives that require a Continental disturbance and
shifting of alliances. Peace just now between Russia and Japan will
mean the strengthening of the disposition of the world toward an
amiable solution of international issues. War anywhere, war for
wliatever cause, War regardless of results, seems to be the idea of
ihe Kaiser respecting German interests. So it may be true, that in
iheir interview on the Gulf of Finland the Czar was stiffened by
the Kaiser and his obdurate attitude is accounted for by the assurance
of German sympathy.
Germany stands to win in the event of further war. Russia has
been financed by France. Not only does France hold her public se
curities to a vast amount, but has extended to her enormous commer
ciaPcredits. Peace would make these claims good. War to a finan
cial breakdown would impair or destroy them, to the vast injury of
France. Talk is cheap, but the fact is that it is a permanent feature
in German policy to weaken France and keep her subordinated as a
Continental power. So we have the Kaiser playing Russia's hand
against the President. In the beginning it was announced from
Russian official sources that if peace negotiations were broken off
Russia would make it plain to the world that Japan was responsible.
This, it was said, would deprive Japan of the sympathy she had en
joyed in the Western world, but the President has spoiled this pro
gramme. The accommodation, the yielding, the willingness to make
the path easy for the other party, the concessions, have all been by
Japan.
That Russia feels keenly her failure to put her. enemy in fault is
shown by the .veiled criticism of President Roosevelt. His word
goes among the nations. He believes in facts as they are. He sees
through the Russian attempt to put Japan in the attitude of sumg
for peace. Like the rest of the world, he knows that Japan is the
victor, and the world knows that her terms to the vanquished are
moderate and reasonable. Russia is no stranger to a war indemnity.-
She exacted it twice from Turkey. The Kaiser took it to the last
possible centime from France. To deny Japan the fruits of her
victory in a war that was forced upon her for self-defense is to trifle
with the world.
There are reasons of course why Russia finds it desirable to
fight on. With these De Witte, the reformer, is probably not in sym
pathy. The Grand Arm}- of Russia, the selected legions that took
part in the stated military reviews, is exhausted. Further war de
pends upon conscripts. These come from the classes in Russia that
disturb the autocracy. What if they have to be kicked and clubbed:
into box cars for transportation to slaughter in Asia! Russia can
spare them and Japan is doing her a favor by killing them. - What
if their families at home perish wretchedly by famine! That is one
way to get rid of people who follow a grievance into revolution against
the autocracy.
It has been the hard task of President Roosevelt. to find in the
Czar motives that arise in a genuine interest in humanity, in a genuine
regard for his people. The President is not one to give up in the face
even of weighty opposition. If the Kaiser could reach the Czar so
can he. He intends that if negotiations fail the blame shall not be
misplaced and that it shall not rest upon him. Russia has failed to
place it upon Japan. If the mighty action at arms ready for demon
stration on the plains of Northern Manchuria and Korea shall soon
take place, the hosts of Oyama, Kuroki and Nogi will have the
sympathy of the lovers of fair play and honest diplomacy. But the
bearded warriors of Linevitch, the conscripts forced from their
homes, will have also the sympathy and the pity from the world
which are denied them by their master.
Mrs. Laura Dainty- Pelham,. an en
thusiastic champion o;C woman, listened
to what the professor had to say and
remarked: "I cannot aigree with Profes
sor Starr's views on tÃis subject. While
it is traditional with* us .that we get
the best guidance from our mothers, I
believe the result is better where the
direction of children is equally divided
between ; the father and the â¢* mother.
There are influences . a mother can
exert over a child which the father
cannot, and In turn ; there are influ
ences which the fathjer can. bring, to
bear which, the mothsr does not pos
sess. I think an 'all-i'pother' child or
an 'all-father' child .is in some
thing." ;S's>Mi ;;v--:-r;V^;; ;v --:-r;V^;
Professor Starr used the words "bar
barism" and "barbarity" In a scientific
sense. He did not intend, according to
those who heard him talk, to convey
the idea that the animal instinct or the
impulse of brutality Is stronger In
woman than in man, but simply that
the personality, intellect and force of
the man, broadly speaking, have a more
powerful, uplifting and developing in
fluence than the same attributes of
woman.
"I was brought up by my mother,
but if I had been brought up by my
father I would not have been 60 bar
barous."
; Professor Starr cited himself as a liv
ing example to demonstrate the, truth
of .what he said. Thfjre was a buzz of
interest and a smiled that" narrowly
missed being audible.\when".the;profes
sor reached this point. The students
thought there " mightT be no room "for
argument, unless it was to call atten
tion to the logical fallacy of, arguing
from an individual case to a general
conclusion. \u25a0\u25a0 \^'O;>-I'.^ \~-:
When man alone Wields an influence
over the child, he says, ttie ( 'result is
more in the ; directioi) of refinement of
character an'dthe development of man
hood. ';
Defending cannibalism, he says it is
all right to eat a healthy companion
to save oneself from starvation. JHe
draws the line, however, on killing the
companion for that purpose. He thinks
the support of foreign missions is a
waste of money, becfiuse. much of the
funds contribnted therefor are injudi
ciously spent, or not spent at all.
Remembering these theories of Pro
fessor Starr, Chicago was not greatly
surprised when he said that woman's
guidance of the young tends to-pro
mote barbarism.
DEFENDS CANNIBALISM.
Two or three months ago he intro
duced what the students -were pleased to
call the "Mexican dope party." The weed
marihuana, which is alleged to produce
strange visions and feelings not cata
logued in; the books on physiology, was
passed around among willing subjects.
It was Professor Starr who' brought the
Alnus from their native islands to -the St.
Louis Fair, after leaning their language
and habits. He studied them carefully
and then announced Ithat the heathen
races are in', many -.respects superior to
the civilized people. \u25a0'.
The American peoplii, he declares; are
gradually taking on the characteristics of
the Indian. Professor; Starr has exam
ined thousands of whites and found that
their cheek bones were becoming higher
and their hair was becoming straighter
and blacker. .^i'i&'Vr *'&'\u25a0?\u25a0 - '
Professor Starr disappears from the
haunts of the white man -every little
while and spends his time among Indian
tribes, into several of jwhich he has been
initiated. ; > i
College students love Professor Starr
for his eccentricities.: He is one of the
interesting figures on the campus. Pedes
trians who meet the professor must take
cere of themselves. He assumes that
part of the, sidewalk is his to walk upon
and that those going in the opposite di
rection intrude on hts domain at their
own risk.
women are responsible for more
barbarism in the world than are men, he
added another to his unique collection of
theories. Professor Starr is taken to task
periodically bp preachers,' scientists, a.nd
especially by women; but he goes his way
convinced that he is right in his views
on human impulses and foibles."
Professor. Starr, is a bachelor. "-. Accord
ing to his own statement he never has
been in love, and never expects to be.
With .complacency he declares ;he does
not understand the* divine passion.'^ â¢â¢\u25a0â¢He.
does, however, believeUn congeniality of
souls, and not long ago devised a "matri
monial party" to demonstrate some!theo
ries regarding the attraction 'which one
person has for another. He gathered to
gether his students and promised to pick
out their affinities from, the crowd.' The
idea of a public mating of students' did
not appeal to some conservative members
of the university,, faculty, and much of
the professor's demonstration was carried
out in private, to the amusement and
embarrassment of the students enlisted.

the University of Chicago, declared

WHAT THE PHILOSOPHER ERASED.
mHIS is what the philosopher wrote on
A his tablet, and then he rubbed out the
words:
Talk universal peace, and believe in it,
regardless of what men may say. The
world always has termed its prophets
cranksâ but mankind advances.
If you have' a better than average
brain, do "not take pride unto yourself
therefor. You did not make the brain.
Rejoice that you and Folly have walked
together. If you never had done so you
would not have known how to avoid the
path that she treads.
As the wise man said, know thyselfâ
but pray without ceasing that nobody else
may.
Judge not by beginnings. Man is born
the mo9t helpless of fools, yet he becomes
thetwisest of all terrestrial creatures.
Thus did the philosopher write. But
he erased the words, for he said to him
self, "Those who know these things do
not need them, and * those who do not
krow never will pay any heed to them."
"Mrs. Billets says that her Bobbie is
for all the world precisely like his father."
"Tnat must please her."
"It does. I was talking with Bobble's
teacher the ; other day, and she told me
that Bobbie was a regular young mut
tonhead."
"Evidently Mrs. Billets is right."
"How did you come out after the races.
Bportleigh?"
"Like most of the rest. I noticed."
"How, was that?" ;
"Walked out."
HOW HE WALKED.
HE received a tip on a favorite horse.
So he went to the races, and rode
in a hack.
Oh, the rest of this tale is bitter or
;v ; worse;
He rode to the races, but
walked
back!
He went for an evening at the club, -

In Trinity's little chapel the wedding
of Miss Ednah Robinson and Charles
Sedgwlck Aiken was celebrated yesterday.
The bride and groom approached th<Â»
altar- together, and in the presence of
only the Immediate families, the scrip
tural words were spoken by Rev. Hulme.
There were no attendants and thÂ«
bride wore her going away gown of
cafe au lait cloth with hat to match.
â¢ The chancel, adorned In strings of
smilax, bore out the note of simplicity
which marked the event.
Mr. and "Mrs. Alken left soon after
for Del Monte and will be at home after
November 1 on Chestnut street. Pre
ceding . the Alken-Roblnson nuptials
was a breakfast "at the Bohemian
Club, and it seems that the intent
secretive was carried further than merely
to the general public.
\> A wedding in Portland took pla<Â«
last Tuesday, the principals being BUsa
Irene Burton of Los Angeles and Wil
liam C. Aiken, a brother of yesterdays
benedict.
; Upon their arrival in this city they
were greatly surprised to find thai
Charles S. Aiken was also about to
enter upon matrimony and that the
motif of the breakfast was of double
intent â complimentary to the recent
wedding and a precursor of the wed
ding so soon to follow.
It Is needless to say that this wa9
indeed a festal board, the air ringing
with messages and wishes congratu
latory.
Probably the wittiest of recent im
promptu verse was heard In these lines
of Charles K. Field, a guest of the
breakfast, and called "The Aiken Epi
demic":

mattt-r attractlns.thc most. public atten

exposure of the Equitable- affairs, : . but
which undoubtedly grew out of that af

point a legislative committee to look into
the affairs of all insurance, companies
doing business in New. York State.
"The legislative committee," said he.
'â¢was chosen for the purpose of investi
gation and to furnish the Legislature at
its regular session in January such in
formation. -as will likely be useful in
the enactment of remedial legislation.
The committee has no; sensational pur

men for the purpose of putting, them on
the gridiron merely with a view of mak
ing them squirm, but none will be spared
in the pursuit of the information that
the \u25a0 Legislature Is seeking. In. other:
words, â¢ the Legislature intends to rtx a
standard for investments by insurance
companies analogous to that we have
in our State for savings institutions, so
that operations of insurance companies
will be strictly confined to what is purely
insurance business. There has been no

The creditors of the firm of Armer
Brothers & Co. of 19 Main street held
their second meeting yesterday after
noon at the rooms of. the, San Fran
cisco Board of Trade to further, dis
cuss the failure of the firm and to get
what light they could regarding the
methods that led to disaster. E. W.
McCarthy, chairman of the committee
of creditors, asked some questions of
Siegfried Armer, who has been man
aging the business at this end of the
line. Not much additional light was
secured as the result of the day's.pro
ceedings. \u25a0
Mr. McCarthy said after the meeting
that the unsecured claims against Armer
Brothers & Co. had been found '\u0084 to
amount to $52,000 in round figures 'and
that the secured claims are only about
$16,000. The assets, as nearly as they
could be figured by the creditors,
amount to only $28,000, leaving a bal
ance due those who are unsecured of
$40,000, the result of three years of
business operations in this city. .Sev
eral creditors questioned /Mr. 'Armer
about the' transactions of ! his% house.
The committee of creditors will prob
ably be ready to report to the body of
creditors early next week.

MANY PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBE
Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound
The wonderful power of Lydia E.
Pinkhara's Vegetable Compound over
the diseases of womankind is not be- ,
cause it is a stimulant, not because it
is a palliative, but simply because it is
the most wonderful tonic and recon-
stroctor ever discovered to act directly
upon the generative organs, positively
curing disease and restoring health and
vigor.
Marvelous cures are reported from
all parts of the country by vromen who
have been cured, trained nurses who
have witnessed cures and physicians
who have recognired the virtue of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, and are fair enough to give
credit where it is due.
If physicians dared to be frank and
open, hundreds of them would acknowl-
edge that they constantly prescribo
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound in severe cases of female ills, as
they know by experience it can be re-
lied upon to effect a cure. The follow-
ing letter proves it. .
Dr. S. C. Brigham, of \u2666 Brigham
Park, Fitchbnrg, Mass., writes :
" It gives me great pleasure to say that I
have found Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound very efficacious, and often pre-
scrine it in my practice for femate difficulties.
"My oliest daughter found itverybenefl-
del for uterine trouble some time ago, and my
youngest daughter is now taking it for a fe-
rcsle m-eakness, and is surely gaining in health
and strength.
" I freely advocate it as a most reliable spe-
cific in all diseases to which women are sub-
ject, and give It honest endorsement."
Women who are troubled with pain-
ful or irregular menstruation, bloating
(or flatulence), leucorrhoea, falling, in-
flammation or ulceration of the uterus,
ovarian troubles, that bearing-down
feeling, dizziness, faintness, indiges-
tion, nervous prostration or the blues,
should take immediate action to ward
off the serious consequences, and bÂ«
restored to perfect health and strength
by taking Lydia K. Pinkham'* Vegeta-
ble Compound, and then write to Mrs.
Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass., for further
free advice. No Kving person has had
the benefit of a wider experience in
treating female ills. She has guided
thousands to health. Every suffering,
woman should ask for and follow her
advice if she wants to be strong and

The California School of Mechanical

matters under way. Opening a week
later than the other schools accounts
for the delay. A meeting was held yes

what men will try. for the. . team.. ... -
Thirty-four athletes 'were^Blgned,-'- out
the positions they specified : will 'not
held in every case. ' "â¢' â¢ ' â¢ ;
Deacon, end on last year's, champion
ship team, is down for quarter; 'but^he
will probably be seen in his old posi
tion. The same holds good with Miller,
the successful '08 athlete. He Is down
for half-back, but his sprinting and
tackling abilities may place him on an
end also. \u25a0 '. '
Where Captain Main will â¢ play Is un
decided. If Trout makes good at full
back "Bill" will probably strengthen
the .line. If not he will play the posi
tion himself.
The candidates for the respective po
sitions follow:
Fullbackâ Trout, Bell. Murray, Captain Main
and Hojers.
Halfback â Miller, Curry, Murray, Johns and

LATONIA MEETING EXTENDED.
NEW TORK, Aug. 24.â 1t is doubtful If
there wap ever a Futurity more of an un
certainty than the one to . be decided =on
Saturday at Sheepshead . Bay. '\u25a0 Already
bookmakers are offering, five to one on
the field and there are no takers even at
those inviting figures. . -- \u25a0
There will be from- sixteen to twenty
starters. Vendor has been beaten more
times than he has won. â¢* Woolwich ' has
won tout about one race. Flip Flap -has
won a race or two and has been beaten. .
First Water has been laid jj on the shelf
and Is an unlikely starter. Jerry Wern
berg has* disappointed many.: times- after
working well. Accountant has run good
and bad races. Esoteric has done 'little
to recommend him,' yet he might be a
good "horse and hard to' beat. Bellmere
has been sold by Madden, who does "not
always sell a Futurity winner. :
Kuroki performed so miserably In -his
last race that Rowe turned" on him with
disgust when he came back to the pad
dock. Athlete is a maiden but a promis
ing colt. Ormondale is at probability, yet
his races have not been of particular im
portance. Running Water is only a good
selling plater. Inquisitor cannot be much
or Mr. Miller would not be so much In
terested in Ormondale. Bellsnicker can-;
not be nearly as good as Belmere or Bur
lew would not have contracted the latter
if he believed his own good : enough to
win. Samson ! Is practically | nothing on
form, though well tried In the early
spring. Bridgeman is speedy, .but has not
shown a disposition to stay a route. ;T}m
ber is.as fast as a streak, but has'stopped
after going half a mile in^two-'sraces.
Both of these races, however; "were^un
on a circular* track V and this "- may -â¢ have
had something to do with his stopping.
Thomas Smith, the racing "secretary
of the Coney Island Jockey Club, .has
furnished the following table of prob
able starters, with their. ' weights, -in
the Futurity, to be run* Saturday next:

They took a short rest after lunch
and spent a half-hour In conversation,
with prison officials and guards. Then
they started homeward, going by way
of San Rafael, which Is a distance of
nearly ten miles, making fifteen miles
for. the day's work. While covering the
last five miles Nelson remarked that
this waa like a picnic to him and that*
he felt as fresh as a daisy. Nelson will
box: three rounds with Bob Lundle on
the platform In the open air to-morrow
afternoon. .It Is expected that there
will be. many present to see him box.
LARKSPUR, Aug. 24. â This was San.
Quentin . day In "Battling" Nelson's
camp and Larkspur did not see much of
him. Those that came to Larkspur ex
pecting to see him do his gymnasium
work this afternoon were disappointed,
as he did not enter the . gymnasium.
Only those staying tlll^a late hour* this
afternoon had an opportunity of con
versing with the Dane, and then only
for a few minutes. The day was prac
tically taken up with his roadwork and
\isit to San Quentin. In company with
Manager Xolan, Bob JLundle, Charlie,
Nelson and a couple of others. Bat left
Smiling Metzner's at 9:80 a. m. ; In an
hour and ten minutes they reached San
Quentin Prison. They took a short rest
in front of the prison and Nelson was
kept busy Introducing the members of
his party to his numerous friends
among the officers, and guards of the
prieon. They were all pleased to see
him and -to converse with him upon dif
ferent subjects. As Bat puts it, "I am a
forty-second . timer here and \u25a0 why
should they not know me." During his
residence In this county he has been a
frequent visitor at. the prison, often
bringing ! friends; ' with him to go
through the. institution. Bat's old and
tried friend, "Papa" Charlie Jones, one
of the guards, was director general
during Bat's visit and made all the nec
essary, arrangements for the entertain
ment of Bat and his party. In company
with Jones and Guard 'F. E.A rmstrong
the party went through the prison.
The jute mill attracted the visitors.
The party received much attention from
the convicts as - they passed through
the yards and^_shops. They all know
Nelson by sight, he having been a fre
quent visitor inside the yard. They
have naturally taken an interest In .all
his fights, and if he does not visit the
yard a short time before a fight they
feel that he will be unlucky. To-day he
said: "The poor boys confined here ex
pect to see me before each fight and,
not that I am superstitious, I intend.to
visit the prison prior to each fight"
After going through the prison they
were entertained at luncheon. -. . '

' It was batting:, day. for the' Commu
ters at the Eighth-street lot yesterday
afternoon;" Every man ! on the team
with 'the exception of Byrnes and
Schmidt, had two or more bingles con
cealed In his stick, and these were un
loaded at times when men lingered on
the bases. Roach was bombarded for
thirteen and the other seven were re
corded against -Fireman Fltzpatrlck,
who had naught save a smile, and at
times he parted from this.
Every fan \u25a0on the lot agreed that
Dunleavy figured to be crowned king
of the occasion. "Dun took five swings
at the leather.' Once he hammered - a
home run out rover the right- fence.
Another time he was \u25a0â¢ there with a
triple and the other two times at bat
he spent in making singles. Right be
hind him came Francks with three and
Qraham with as many.
The funny part of the struggle was
that the -Slwashes did not make a mis
take In the field. Every man on the
team managed to get what was hit to
him, but as most of them were not hit
to -that part of the lot where fielders
stood, guard, it turned out that runs
came even without the asking.
Oakland opened right up with two In
the first Inning on a i pair,, of .smart
singles by Francks and Kelly and Dun
leavy's three-cushion shot out to where
Old Glory, waves In, the center garden.
For an inning the Oaks tarried, but In
the third they grabbed another one.
They topped^off their grand total with
i four in the fifth and five in the eighth.
It was during the latter mix-up that
Dunleavy copped off his homer. < Two
men 5 were waiting on the bases at the
time. / ' ..' â¢'";\u25a0*'\u25a0 \u25a0"\u25a0

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
The second day of the military athletic
competition of , the Department of Cali
fornia held; at - the 'Presidio ' yesterday
again brought out some speedy winners.'
Private Samuel W." Johnson showed he is
a crack ' sprinter, winning the final heat
of the 100-yard dash in ten seconds.
The event of the day was the 220-yard
run. In : -.this ,-: Sergeant Fachman and
Private Hunt tied for first " place.' They
crossed the tape together, , covering the
distance in 'the sensational , time of
twenty-two ' seconds. For the last ten
yards down the stretch the \ men ran
abreast. The excitement was intense dur
ing the race, â¢ not' only among the officers
and soldjers but also among the specta
tors in the grand stand. The ladies, who
were present in large numbers,- joined in
the .general applause and, standing up on
their seats,, cheered the sprinters as they
raced down the track to the finish.. As
they crossed the line both fell, into the
arms of their comrades exhausted.
Hunt was the lion' of the day, as, be
sides tying for first place in the 220-yard
dash, he won* the l_--yard hurdles and
ran second in the 220-yard, hurdles.
In the afternoon the Presidio
team played the Fifteenth Infantry team.
At the end of the fourth inning the score
was 11 to 2 in favor of Presidio. At this
juncture the pitchers \of the Fifteenth
Infantry were exhausted and refused to
play longer. The umpire declared the
game forfeited to^ Presidio with a score
of 9 to 0. .The team of the Thirteenth In
fantry beat the Fort Miley team 13 to 3.
The | contests will be finished to-day.

SARATOGA, Aug. 24.â N0 longer, flows
the golden flood through Saratoga. The
spring from which it came was cut. off
at its source to-day. Thousands left on
the special trains with slender . purses
and some with no purses at all.'
â¢The bookmakers and gamblers are won
dering to-nigh., where the visiting throngs
got all the money which was taken away
from ... them. Millions of dollars have
changed hands at the | whirl of the wheel
or the stride of the horse.- Never in the
history of the temples of chance here, or
for that matter, . anywhere else in the
country, has the average of play been
higher or the volume of money been
greater. There have been, few. sensa
tional plays, yet .the amount which has
passed over the green- cloth or into the
japanned boxes of the . bookmakers has
reached astonishing figures.
It, is estimated that the layers i of : odds
have handled $15,000,000 this season at the
track and that more than $4,000,000 has
been risked at play in this American
Monte Carlo. The winnings of the book
makers are estimated at $1,300,000 and the
harvest of vie gamblers has been esti
mated at $500,000. A considerable portion
of :the latter sum the betting ring got.
These figures are based on the calcula
tions of the bookmakers, the sheet writ
ers and dealers, and it is believed they
represent actual conditions as nearly as
It is possible- to do so.
Everybody seemed to have come to
Saratoga with money to risk and chances
were taken with good humor and disdain
of all consequences, which astonished
even the professional . gamblers. â¢ The
banks have been attending to the wants
of ' their patrons who wished - > checks
cashed on short notice* and faro, banks
have been equally accommodating. It is
an unusual thing to see the financial In
stitutions of a village lighted up brilliant
ly at night as they are here, but the real
banks do it- so the public may see the
safety, deposit "boxes. . ,\u25a0\u25a0 ;

Â»W-day at Fort Erie. The track waa

I seemed to have a line on the mudders,

Manager Jim Coffroth signed contracts
with Miles Brothers yesterday for the
moving pictures which will be a feature
of the Britt-Nelson light at Colma on
Admission day. Coffroth hires the firm
to take the pictures and the films will be
delivered to him. He will have them
copyrighted and will then dispose of them.
Coffroth pays Nelson $5000 for his one
third interest, Britt retaining hia one
third share in the venture. '. .
If the flght lasts forty-five rounds
13.200 feet of films or two and .one-half
miles will be required to get an impres
sion of all the .Incidents which will take
place in . the ring. At fifteen cents per
foot the film alone will cost JI9SO. This
is by far the longest photographic film
ever brought to California. In order to
be ready in case anything goes wrong
with one camera, there will be two .others
held In reserve to be pressed into ser
vice at a moment's notice.
The fighters are to be ready to step
from_ their dressing rooms at 1:30 o'clock
on the day of the fight. The fight "is set
for 2 p. m. Ten minutes before that time
the picture 'machine will be set' in mo
tion to catch all the Incidents preceding
the fight. If the pictures prove a failure
owing to defective light or other condi
tions the venture will cost Coffroth
*2500.
If the pictures are a marked success
they will return a fortune to their own
ers. They will be, an especial attrac
tion in all the small theaters through
out the world."
Instead of an outer fence of boards
a barbed wire affair will be erected to
keep out those who want to beat^ the
irate at Colma. Inside this obstruction
there will be men \u25a0 armed with rifles,
while outside some men on horseback
will keep back all intruders.
The advance applications for seats
are so numerous that Manager Coffroth
has already increased the seating ca
pacity of the amphitheater. Each speo
tator is allowed 680 square Inches of
space. Two sides of the fence are al
ready in place, and 300 wagon-loads of
lumber are on the ground.
- Prospective- referees were out in.
force last night, each with his light
ning 1 rod In place and hoping 'the' ap^
pointment would strike him. A longr
session is expected to-morrow, when,
the representatives of | the 'principals
will meet to name the man for thelm
portant post.

* . An attempt was made yesterday by
Ernest Moore Chadwick, alias Sfr lla.rry
".iÂ«stwood CoÂ«per, to- prevent ~hJs wife's
testimony, from being taken in his trfal
for bigamy by rilinc v. transcript In the
Supreme Court asking that a decision
of -.udge Sloss giving Norine Pearl
Schneider-Chadwick a divorce 'be .'an
nulled. -
"Although the. decision of the divorce
court was four; .'years ago and
both the husband and wife have again
remarried,"he;will uÂ»e every, effort to
have an appeal taken, because the law
srys a wife cannot testily against her
husband. This would* relieve him. from
much, fariiiety "over the" effect ' of tier
evidence In his trial. ,
'But .according to' a'ruleof the Su
preme Court a transcript for an appeal
must be tiled not later than forty days
alter a ..otiee of appeal is filed. If this
rule- holds In' .Chad wick's case his act
will be frustrated. The complications
resulting from his later, marriage with
Mlbs Teresa. Vandvelden and his wife's
marriage with E, J. .Kelleyare all" to
be- brought out in the case later. -

Is Glust a Liquid t
""When a liquid crystallizes," says
Morris W. Travers, in a recent lecture,
"heat Is evolved, and it Is found that
the solid and liquid have different den
sities; there is. In fact, a discontinuity
In the properties of the solid and liquid
states, or. to use the modern term,
phases of the . substance. The forma
tion of the glassy substance Is not.
however, accompanied by any such
change: It is in fact only a highly
viscous liquid. Clear proof of the liquid
nature of window glass, for Instance,
lies in the fact that a cut made in It wfth
a diamond rapidly 'heads,' so that after
a short time the glare Is less readily
broken along the cut than when it wa*
first made. Such glassy bodies cannot
be regarded as true solids, which
should, in every case, be capable ot
existing In a crystalline form, though
this is not ' always apparent. Some
times, particularly at low temperatures.
It is difficult to determine whether a
substance Is actually in the crystalline
or glassy condition, and its true 'state
can be determined only by observing
the change which takes place when the
liquid is cooled. In the case of some
paraffin hydrocarbons, for instance, the
liquid becomes thick and treacly before
passing into the glassy oondltlon. In
no case can petrol be made to crystal
lize. Liquid hydrogen, when evaporated
in vacuo, does not become more vlscou*
as its temperature falls, but when a
temperature corresponding to about 14.1
degrees absolute is reached, flakes of
glassy matter break away at the sur
face and finally the whole mass turns
to a clear glassy solid." â National

To Tunnel Mont Blanc.
M. Gauthier's scheme Is to open a yet
quicker means of communication, first of
all with Switzerland. This would be pro
vided by tunneling the Faucille Pass, an
engineering work estimated to cost $23.
000.000 and to take five year 3. The second
and more sensational part of the schema
is the proposed continuation of. the llnÂ©
from Geneva via Cnamontx through
Mont Blanc to Aosta. thus connecting
with all the Italian system. The magni
tude of such . an enterprise as tunneling
Mont Blanc rather takes one's breath,
away, but the project Is said to have been
already well thought out and elaborated
in detail. It would certainly be a gigantic
scheme for France, as It would probably
divert half the traffic of the Bt. Gothard
and Slmplon routes to French railways.â

The right ascension of the sun. the
heliacal rising. and the meridian pas
sages of stars are believed to have been
noted at Zimbabwe. These ancient
builders were also past mastars In the
science of military defense, the walla
showing that the builders were military
strategists of the highest order. Their
gold ornaments, finely designed and
engraved. - could * not have been the
work of an uncivilized people, and tha
hundreds of ancient .gold mines show
that they were skilled In metallurgy
and picked out rich shoots, patches and
pockets with marvelous cleverness. It
Is estimated that from these wide
spread mines they extracted $375,000,
000 of gold. â Geographical Journal.

There is overwhelming evidence at
the Great Zimbabwe of the ancient civ
ilization and arts possessed by the
builders of the earliest period. The
Zimbabwe temple Is the finest and most
intact example of a nature worshiping
shrine known to the world. Its
construction points unmistakably to
some knowledge of goemetry and as
tronomy on the part of the builders. It
is oulte certain that even the crude*
methods at Zimbabwe of applying thiÂ»
knowledge, which was common to t!i Â»
ancient Semitic peoples, were imported
from the near east and did not origin
ate in Southeast Africa.
Richard N. Hall, who has given eight
years to the study of the ancient mon
uments in Southern Rhodesia, says that
none of the hundreds of ruins has been,
more than partially explored. Many Im
portant ruins have been seen only by
casual travelers, and the work of un
earthing only a part of the Great Zim
babwe area would be more than the
labor of a lifetime. Still, research* s
have made great progress In the pa.it
few years. There are in Rhodesia no
less than 300 distinct ruins and groups
of ruins. Only a few of these are en
titled to rank as "ancient." The larger
part of them probably do not date back
of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fif
teenth centuries.

Curtis* death was caused by epilepsy.
The space In the death certificate,
where it was to be^atated whether de
ceased was "married or single." -was
finally filled in with "divorced." One
of Curtis' friends volunteered that In
formation, but refused to go Into the
details of Curtis' past history.
Curtis was 44 years old and a native
of Philadelphia. He came to San Fran
cisco at an early age and became con
nected with the firm of Payot, Uphara
& Co. He advanced rapidly and gained
the reputation of being a keen busi
ness man.
Curtis was living: at thÂ« Cameron
apartment house with a woman who
called herselfs Mrs. Clarke. She. claimed
that she was married to Curtis by con
tract. The woman's name Is Caroline
Clarke. She Is the daughter of Curtis'
landlady and is a designer for the De
lineator.
Shortly after the divorce Curtis re
signed "from his position, much against
the wishes of the firm, and went to Xew
York to begin all over. There ho ob
tained a place with the Faber Pencil
Company and used the assumed name of
Clarke. ';';. :'.'.\
Jonathan Curtis, who died In New York
on Tuesday, was at one time manager
tor Payot,.Upham & Co., the well-known
local stationers and publishers. He was
married to the daughter of Henry Payot,
head of the firm, until about two years
agro. when the couple were divorced. Tho
marriage was aulte a social event and
the separation caused considerable sur
prise at the time. The deceased leaves
several children here.

\rw YORK, Aug. 24. â The faith of a large
pert of the financial world In a happy solution
of the proceedings at Portsmouth seems to be
bo strong that it Ignored aU rumors of _an
cther ererfoire bitch in the negotiations to-day.
The leeuee which camÂ« in for this distinction
lnciuoed three of the market leader*, namely.
Union Pacific, United States Steel, preferred
and Reading. In Its attitude the local market
hed the open encouragement of London and
other European financial centers where Ameri
can securities with but few exceptions were
rtr.erally strong. Aeide from the situation at
Porismotsth. other considerations, such as fa
vorable weekly returns by the bank of Eng
land and the Back of Franoe, were Impelling
factor*. London bought liberally here and
German banking Interests took a large amount
of Pennsylvania, which It U authoritatively
Kcted is to bÂ« listed on the Berlin Exchange
Pennsylvania was the most conspicuous fea
ture at the opening, which was broad. The
etock advanced easily on heavy trading, gain
ing not auite a full point. Amalgamated Cop-
Ser shared honors with Pennsylvania and
treater gains on smaller tranÃactions were
scored at ttÂ» outset by Louisville & Nashville.
Colorado Fuel. Metropolitan Street Railway and
some leeÂ» orominent issues. Prices yielded
some en heavy profit taking shortly after the
first outburst. Union Pacific Misourt Pacific,
6t Paul, Reading *nd Atchison tailing be
low the previous day's closing price* and the
tone of the market became relatively quiet.
The movement in Pennsylvania found many
followers, however, and commission houses and
traders boufht this stock, also Southern Rall-
Ti-ay and the United State* Steel Issues. Un
ion Paeiae noon recovered more than Its loss.
The etrength of this Issue Is partly explained
by the near epproach of the dosing of the
trastfer books which may cause the calling of
a lot of stock now out on loans. It was not un
til of ted midday that. Reading once more ss
sumed the leadership, advancing rapidly on
heavy buying of the character heretofore
noted Irom 118%. JU low price of the morn
ing, to 122%. a bc-w high record r For a
time at least, the balance of the lift nhowed
Uttle sympathy with the renewed strength
of Heading and the market again developed
m>%. Irregular tendency, until Union Pad a cs.
ttÂ£".;*hed its new high record from which
attention was train diverted by a fresh rise
In Heading to 123%. This sensational move
ment created fears of a "corner" and unset
tled the general list to the extent of wiping
out practically all of the day's substantial
galne, ci>d in sotse Instances sending prices
below the previous day's close. Reading made
a net rain of 3%i points. Amalgamated Cop
per made a one-pclnt response to a further <
rise in the crice of the metal, the third re
ported this week, but its gain 'was lost in the
final decline. An advance ot M cent t>er
pound in the . price of lead failed to stimulate
National Lead chares. Close observers re
ported considerable realizing throughout the
day under cover of advances in Reading and
Union Paclfla, but under the scare created by
It. flr.al movement in Reading offerings were
freely absorbed. The volume of business was
tui'.n vt-ry large, making he third consecutive
cky of transactions well in excess of & mil*
lion eihares. â¢ . .

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO BOARD OF. TRADE.
'J: CHICAGO, Aug. s 24.â Estimates f forecasting
the, shipment of immense quantities "of; the ce
real troro Argentine - precipitated ja' sharp break
in .wheat prices here to-day. September closed ,
%<& 'Ac down. - â¢ September corn is \u25a0 up . %<v; Oats 1

.-. Wheat opened easy, with seemingly nothing
in \u25a0\u25a0 the news to , justify \u25a0 the sentiment except a
modification ; of the previous bullish undertone
in Northwestern >â¢ markets. On - the contrary,
there were elements \u25a0of i strength '.in ) the Â»itua- .
tion which ' began ; almost immediately ( to j have
effect. . There was an :â¢ apparent 1 reluctance jon
the part of farmers. to accept prevailing prices, .
as evidenced, by small" receipts. -September,
which was freely' offered at the outset by lead*,
ing pit traders afBo%e to -80%câ^c to 14c
â¢under'" the \u25a0 ."previous close-.â found" I " ready pur- ;
chasers in local shorts, - : who were becoming un
easy over the outlook. \u25a0 Weakness \u25a0-* was . suc
ceeded -almost* 1 immediately ' by \u25a0 strength '. and
buying orders_ from outsiae Degan ; to come in.
September /quickly . made \up the initial loss
and V continued to advance until " It reached
81& C. At this point reports' of Argentine ship
ments aggregating 5. 000,000 : bushels, ; against
half that quantity a year ago, caused - aâ¢re
vision of feeling and a quick reaction in prices.
The market soon became oversold.' - Septem
ber broke to SOc and closed weak- Â£*Bo%c.
, Corn was firm: SeptemDer j started S with . a
tain of %c at 53% c, advanced under the force
of active covering by shorts to 54% c. *- The
price suffered to": the- extent of . %c=with. the
break in wheat, but at" the close confidence/had
been restored , and' 'â¢ prices were again lon the
rise. "September closed firm at 54>4c. V . " .
\u25a0 " The oats market showed a steady under
tone. September closed â¢at 26c, after, having
sold up from 25% cat the start to 20% c.

Late yesterday afternoon the Bay Cities
Water Company, through its manager, C.
N. Deal, addressed a communication to
the Board of Supervisors proposing to
sell to the city of San Francisco a new
source of water supply, located high up
in the Sierra Nevada. The price asked
for this water site alone is $9,150,000, and
the total cost of transmission, including
a distributing system in this city, is to
be J35,453,700. The Bay Cities Water Com
pany will either sell the water source as
it is now, or will complete the system
end put in all the pipes, reservoirs, tele
phone lines and the distributing system.
This company maintains in its communi
cation that by buying this system the
city would be provided with a supply of
v.ater large enough for the needs of
2,500.000 people, the co6t of which would
be so low that the water rate would be
greatly reduced. Pure water is promised.
The property of the Bay Cities Water
Company lies on the west sides of the
Sierra in the region of the Echo Lakes
end the south branch of the American
River. The district is known ac the
American-Cosumnes watershed. There
are more than fifty natural lakes within
this district, besides innumerable moun
tain springs and perennial mountain
streams. The elevation ranges from 1500
feet above the level of the sea to a
maximum of 10,430 feet, the summit of
Round Top Mountain. The average ele
vation is 6500 feet above the San Fran
cisco base.
LIES OX CBAXITE SL'IIFACE.
The surface of the proposed â¢water site
is made up of bare granite masses, pre
senting clean precipitous sides, inter
spersed with small patches of pine tim
ber. There is very little soil or under
brush, the water being exposed to the
cold air of the mountains. Around on
many summits lie banks of perpetual
snov. The precipitation Is uniform, 67
per cent of the area having an average
annual rainfall of a little over sixty
inches. ; .-Â»."' *\u25a0\u25a0
The letter states that the water rights
of this area are long exlstant and that
there is no Question as to the validity
of the titles.
The plans of the Bay Cities Water
Company are based on supplying San
Francisco and delivering daily a supply
of 75,000.000 gallons of water, of develop
ing from the waters before they enter
the pipe lines leading to this city about
6400 horse-power of electrical energy; of
transmitting this electric power to San
Francisco and of providing here a dis
tributing plant for the water, including
relay reservoirs near the city to provide
for any possible emergency.
THREE YEARS TO INSTALL*
The Bay Cities Company has had its
engineers working on the proposition . for
over two years. The surveys were made
under the guidance of Engineer Edwin
Duryea. Last autumn an expert, Engi
neer Frank S. Washburn, was brought
out from New York to make an un
biased estimation of the amount of the
cost and the feasibility of the plan. . The
works could be Installed within three
years.
In this communication there are inter
esting tables comparing the proposed sys
tem with that of the Spriog Valley Water
Company. In these the capacity of the
Spring Valley Is given as 35.000.000 gallons
per day as against 75,000,000 for the pro
posed system. The cost of the Spring
Valley supply per million gallons is given
as $1,050,714, and that of the proposed new
one for the same amount at $395,689. The
company maintains that the new system
would save the city thousands of dollars
each year.
The Supervisors have not considered
the proposition. The City Engineer Is at
\u25a0 the present time Investigating other
water 6ltes aad he will undoubtedly re
port on these before he takes the new
plan In hand. The next meeting of the
â¢ board wIU be on September 1L

water from Portland, and was arrested at

registered, by Detectives Ryan and ODea
on a "warrant j charging her with passing

tion for appendicitis upon Mrs. Gordon at
the California Woman's Hospital last
December. : She was accompanied by her
husband when they first called upon him.
After- the operation ' Mrs. Gordon gave Dr.
Vowinckel a promissory note for $608, the
amount of his fees,, payable two months
after 'â¢ date, but it was not met at J ma
turity. Dr. Vowlnckel alleged that later
he | received a - letter | from â¢ Keho, s ( Nev.;
from Mrs. Gordon, saying that she was
the divorced wife of W. A. McCord .of
San Francisco, ! and was not ' married to
E. S. Gordon of North Bend, Ore., as she
had represented. She was alone respon
sible for the amount, she said, and-want
ed a reduction. Dr. Vowinckel also swore
out Â» warrant for g Gordon's arrestV for
making false: representation. .
; Mrs. Gordon denied yesterday that she
had ever written j to Dr. Vowinckel , that
she was not Mrs. Gordon, and denes. him
to produce such a letter. She said she
understood that the promissory note was
for a year and was to bear 6 per cent, in
terest. ' . \u25a0 , /. '\u25a0\u25a0 ....
"I have been the wife of E. S. Gor

Among the chair warmers in Police
Judge Mogan's court was a weak-eyed
man. with hands resting upon the knob
of a heavy walking stick. His trousers
were baggy and curled at the bottom.
"BIT me," he said to his near left
hand neighbor, a 'all man of melan
choly visage, "hlf me Lud Sawlsb'ry

is 'im a-sitting in th' bloomin* caige."
The person to whom he referred was
William "Willard, aocused of street beg
ging, who certainly did resemble Eng
land's late Premier in all pnysical char
acteristics. His massive head was bald
above the ears, his brow was both wide
and lofty, above his eyes was thick
thatch and below them were billowy
furrows and his iron-gray beard was
luxuriant.
"Did yer Lord Salisbury comb his
whiskers with his fingers?" the sad
faced man inquired.
"Xot as I hever 'card hof, an'l per
soom he caombed 'em with a comb."
"Then that ain't him in th' dock."

dead, didn't I?"
"Well, let him an' me rest."
Mr. Willard had not completed the
straightening of his facial appendage
with his fingers when a bailiff placed
him before the bench. He was accost

SALTRHEUMON HANDS
Suffered Agony and Had to Wear
Bandages Afl the Time
ANOTHER CURE BY GUTICURA
Another cure by Cuticura is told of
by Mrs. Caroline Cable of Waupoca,
Wis., in the following grateful letter:
"My husband suffered agony with salt
rheum on his hands, .and I had to keep
them bandaged all the time. We tried
everything we could get, but nothing
helped him until he used Cuticura.
One set of Cuticura Soap, Ointment,
and Pills cured him entirely, and his
hands have been as smooth as possi-
ble ever since. I dohopethis letter
will be the means of helping some
Â» other sufferer."
HAPPY RESULTS OBTAINED
By the Use of the Hevr Scalp Antiseptic
It wouldn't take long- to number the
hairs in the heads of some people, the
reason being they haven't many to
number. In most instances, however,
the fault is their own. A g-erm at the
, root soon plays .havoc .with the most
luxuriant growth and causes it to fade
and fall -out. A remedy for this has re-
cently bten discovered, called: Newbro's
Herpicide. that acts by destroying the
Kerm that does the damage," besides re-
moving: all impurities from ; the scalp.
In addition it 'permits new. life and
vigor to enter the scalp, and happy re-
sults are sure to be obtained f.rom its
use.. Try it. Sold by leading drug-
gists. Send 10c In stamps forsample to
. The Herpicide Co., Detroit, Mich. At
leading drug stores or sent prepaid
