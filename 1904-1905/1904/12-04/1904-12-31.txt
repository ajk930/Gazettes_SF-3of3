obfedlent and docile and went about
their -work as If nothing had happened
to intensify their desire for freedom!
After the previous break those prison
ers who expressed dissent to deeds of
the conspirators were marked by their

Swathed in bandages, on a hospital
cot, Convict Findley told Warden Yell
of the course the convicts Intended to
follow had they succeeded In taking a
guard post. A 6tory had been sent out
thai the conspirators had so timed the
break as to enable them to board the
prison locomotive on its arrival at the
<juaxry and Epeed toward the town of
Folsom. Findley declared that the in
tention of the plotters was not to take
the locomotive, but to strike directly
for the American River, which runs
alonz the prison grounds and wade
across the shallow stream to the wood
ed shore on the other, side and thence
strike for the open coiftitry.
Warden Yell believes Findley's story.

MOVING BOG
WIPES OUT
A VILLAGE
Sweeps Down With
out Warning on
Homes;
Terrible Disaster Occurs in
Ccnnty Roscommon,
Ireland.
Well Tilled Farms Are Buried Under
Peat and Water and Tenants
Narrowly Escape Death.
Soeelal Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 30.â Graphic details
are now being received of the devasta
tion, caused by a moving bog in the
county of Roscommon, Ireland. The
bog. which Is known as that of Cloon
shlever, is three miles from Castlerea.
When It began to slide it moved three
quarters of a mile in a few days, cov
ering everything in its way with peat
and water to a depth of eight or ten
feet. On Lord de Freyne's French Park
estate, the peasants*are surrounded on
all sides with miles 'of bog and water.
Sad is the story of the hamlet of
Cloonshiever with Its forty or fifty
little one-Btory whitewashed cottages.
Last Saturday an immense bog which
overhangs the valley, without any pre
vious warning, swept down on them
like an avalanche. The first Intimation
the villagers had of this visitation was.
when the bog stuff was dashing in the
doors of the houses so rapidly that It
was with the. greatest difficulty that
many of the unfortunate people escaped
with their lives. ' : '; . '
A. visit to th> scene of. the .disaster
â showed the mountain' which Is eleven
or twelve miles in extent, rent and
toriras if by an earthquake. The mov
ing portion was about three hundred
yards square and had been carried
fully three-quarters of a mile. The ruin
and destruction which such a mass has
left in Its train can be more easily
imagined than described. Many, of the
houses have wholly disappeared, while
all that .is to be seen of others is a
chimney top here and there. leaf
less trees mark the spot from which
well tilled farms have disappeared
practically forever.
At one point a lake of about ten or
twelve acres has been formed in the
last few days by the pent up moun
tain streams. Unless some means is
speedily adopted to drain off this water
it w-lll undermine the entire bog and a
disaster of an overwhelming nature
may be anticipated. It would be im
possible to exaggerate the miserable
condition of the villagers. Houseless
and penniless they wander about the
scenes of their former homes .with
nothing hut want and starvation fac
ing them and their families.

his seat in the United States Senate is
on. â¢â '..-'â¢';â¢
"Friends who are looking out for my
interests there have" . advised .me by
wire that it would be desirable. for me
to be there at least for a few days
prior to the balloting," said Senator"
Bard. in an interview to-night, "but I
cannot see how I can go there. I
could not take the risk in the first place
of neglecting my public duties to look
after my personal interests, and in the
second place I would not be Justified in
doing so unless there-was a great ne
cessity apparent. I am satisfied that my
friends will look out for me in. my ab
sence quite as well as though I were
there. I therefore do not see the neces

Is already gone and with a j great deal
of what I deem j very important work
still to be transacted. The statehood

very strongly in this matter of securing
for the West a larger quota of repre

position on the .statehood bill in the
committee that I feel I should main
tain on the floor. I am the only Repub
lican member on the committee opposed
to the bill, and long ago "gave notice
in the time of Mr. Quay and his omni
bus billâ that it could not get through
if it needed my vote. Besides this
there are a number of other matters
especially important to California that
have been referred to the Committee
on Irrigation, of which I am chairman.
Among these is the report on the Gov
ernment's reclamation work on the
Colorado" River. There were important
matters also before other committees
of which I am a member, especially of
Public Lands and Indian Affairs. These
are public duties, and however gratify

members of the CallfornlafLegislature
at this time. I do not feel that I could
take the risk of neglecting my duties."
CONTEST FOR SENATOR.
Bard and Flint Forces Active In Be
half of "the Candidates.
Many members of the Legislature
who have come here within two days
will leave town this evening for Sacra
mento. Bard, Flint and Knight head
quarters In the capital city will be
opened to-night.
Yesterday Senator Bard wired from
Washington, Di C, to one of the man
agers of his campaign that : he could
not be in Sacramento before the ballot
ing began. Quite a number of Senators
and Assemblymen visited the Bard
headquarters in the Mutual Savings
Bank building yesterday. Bard men
were also numerous at the. palm court
of the Palace Hotel. E. O. Gerberding
and Frank . J. . Brandon of the Bard
forces are confident that the Senator is
gaining votes. It is claimed that Bard's
strength when the, balloting begins will
surprise the politicians who have been
taking their "tips" from the Demo
cratic press. â¢ . .
Frank P. Flint and the promoters of
his candidacy are making an active
and somewhat enthusiastic, campaign.
Leaders In the Flint camp claim that
their candidate will take the lead on
the first ballot. A report last evening
that four members of the Alameda del
egation have resolved to vote for Flint
gave upward tendency to the stock of
the Los Angeles aspirant. Gossip under
the palms was . to the effect that Gov
ernor Pardee had given - a hint favor
able to Flint. Close friends of the Gov
ernor, . however, insist that he is abso
lutely neutral.

NEW YORK, Dec. 30.â "I. never- re

when Informed that- there was, a rumor
that former Governor Black is : to suc

shall remain in the United States'Sen

the thought - of resigning if " Black had
been elected in Senator Depew's place.
I was as much interested in the return
of Depew as if I myself had been the
candidate."
When asked what effect the return
of Senator Depew would .have- on. the
organization, Senator Platt said, "I do
not 8e*e that It will have any particular
effect."
"Your friends are saying that .you
now will resume active leadership 'â  of
the organization," It 'was suggested.
"It Is useless to discuss a' matter of
that character at this time," said the
Senator.
"Do you expect to j confer : with G ov
ernor Odell over " organization mat
ters?" .
"I do not knowwhat I. Bhould^confer
with him about," said Mr. Platt "I
may see him. 1 I suppose he will send
for me. I expect to see Speaker Nixon
before the organization of the . Legisla

"Will you have- any recommenda

"I am always Interested in good . gov

Senator Depew and Louis Payne
called at the office of Senator Platt to

MANT RESOLUTIONS.
"With the exception of the resolution
part referring to the Increased school
revenue the report was adopted as
read. The reason the other part went
over 'was because the resolutions com
mittee had covered the subject.
The report of the committee on reso
lutions was read by Professor Ltnscott
of Santa Cruz. It emphasized belief in
State^ county, city and local taxation
for support .of. our system of public
schools, beginning with the kindergar
ten and ending In a free State nnivae
sity; In the consolidation of weak rural
school^ by means of free transporta
tion jto pupils to central graded schools;
in national school supervision; in
'school libraries and well paid and well
trained teachers; the organizing of
high schools wherever they can be
properly? supported; that teachers
should be carefully selected and tenure
of office be on efficiency ; belief in pop
ular local self-government of schools.
The code of professional ethics adopt
ed by the California State Teachers'
Association in 1901 Is reaffirmed and
the support of It was urged.
The following: resolution was Included
in the report:
â¢Whfinss. It seem* of vital Importance thai
nor* money be appropriated for the support
of the schools of this State; therefore, be It
Resolved, That a committee of flvÂ« be ap
pointed Immediately by the president of this
association to .consider legislation needed t-Â»
procure the Increase of the salaries of the
teachers of the State and to prepare such bills,
to be presented to the Legislature, as In the
judgment â¢ of the committee wtu secure that
end.
EQUAL) SUFFRAGE.
The resolution presented by ths
Council of Education relative to rural
school tupervlsion was indorsed; also
that In regard to equal suffrage.
The report stated that as the study
of education if pursued effectively
must employ the laboratory method.
It. is: urged that the State Teachers*
"Association urge the necessity for the
immediate establishment of such 'a
practice school at the .University of
California as an indispensable Instru

of teachers for the schools of the State.

Storm signals . and a scurrying for
shelter of the fleets of small craft and
fishermen's boats yesterday morning
told of the coming of a southerly gale
that would not be pleasant for out or
in bound craft or the toilers of the bay.
Early Thursday night the wind com
menced to blow from pie southeast
and later It veered to the southwest,
tucked itself under the corners of
Mission housetops, fell upon the ship
ping in Mission harbor,. and threw.it
self against the worm-eaten piling of
docks at the south end with a fury
that promised a still greater exposi
tion of temper on the part; of the wind
god.
Every ship captain' whose vessel
was alongside a dock with a southern
exposure got out extra lines and pre
pared for a wild night of bump and
grind with the. wharves. Tugboats
got busy in their engine-rooms and
had up steam to reseue the big ships
that would strain at their anchor
chains in the middle harbor. Inbound
vessels beat on and off in the high
seas, reeled to shortened sails and
avoided the angry., looking bar that
was tossing with more whiteness than
a pillow fight in a young ladies' sem
inary. â 
Then came the lull and the down
pour of rain. The bay. and the ocean
fought the clouds, but- Boreas only
laughed at their belated efforts. The
wind ran the bluff and the water
called it â but it was too late.
When Chief Wharfinger Dick Welch
â politician sometimes and able sea
man always â went to bed night before

The capsizing of the Western Fuel
Company's barge^ Courser luckily did
net involve loss of life, but the won
der is that it did not. Frank Chris

his wife and child. The Courser was
being roughly handled by the heavy

from her berth at the little Mail dock

was more sheltered water. Before the

the Mail dock Mrs. Christiansen was
persuaded to come ashore with her
little girl. . Soon afterward the boat
turned turtle and there were only the
three men and a dog aboard..

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 30.â Charges of
petty graft and laxity in management
bordering on criminality against Super
intendent Sherman Smith of the "Whit
tier Reform School have caused the
breaking of the storm that had long
hovered over that institution. As a re
sult of the dark clouds that suddenly
loomed up. Smith and the board of trus
tees. Dr. Walter Lindley, T. E. Newlin
and James Clarke, were called to Sac
ramento by the Governor and it is
said a hot conference was held behind
closed doors. - They returned to-day,
but would say nothing further than
that everything is satisfactory.
In a general way things have been
running smoothly at the Whittier re
formatory, with apparently perfect
harmony between the trustees and
superintendent, and good discipline
among the inmates, but rumors of
"graft" have from time to time been
heard regarding Smith. They reached
the State Board of Charities and Cor
rections and a committee consisting of
its vice president. Rev. Dr. J. K. Mc-
Lean and O. K. Cushlng, was appoint
ed to investigate.
Their report, together with that of
the secretary of the board, W. A.
Gates, was sent to Governor Pardee a
month ago. It reflected severely, not
only on Smith but on the trustees as
well.
It is said nothing will result from the
Investigation, whatever may have tjeen
found. There seems to have been a
desire on the part of all persons di
rectly interested, including the Gover
nor, to keep the scandal quiet.

Mrs. Metcalfe, because of whom the
murder was committed, is still held,
by the police. She is in a highly ner
vous state, appearing most concerned
for the safety of the man who sent
her husband to the grave. "Oh, I
could not testify against -him," she
remarked. Of any .one who spoke
with her yesterday she made the same
inquiry: "Did they catch him yet?-Dd
they know where he is?"
She admitted that she had been liv
ing with Keeley, offering as an ex
cuse that her husband was brutal to
her. But she stuck to her denial that
there was any conspiracy to kill Met
calfe. "I wanted a divorce," she said.
"I did not want him to be killed. It
was terrible."
The police are confident that they ;
have evidence to convict Keeley of
the crime. Four detectives are de- 1
tailed on the case, Dinan, Wren, Cole- |
man and Taylor.
The remains of Bruce Metcalfe have I
been taken In charge by Mrs. Chri3 I
F. Ryer. They will be interred to- j
day from her home, 721% Grove
street.

Employes of Massachusetts
Cotton Mills Decide by
Large Vote to Remain Out
FALL. RIVER, Mass., Dec. 30. â The
labor unions involved since last July
in a strike in a 12% per cent reduction
in wages in the cotton mills, by a vote
of approximately 2 to 1* approved of
the contest. The call for meetings of
the unions to vote on a continuanoe of
the contest was prompted by an agi
tation of the question whether the em
ployes should return to work for the
winter under the reduction and renew
the strike later if wages were not ad
vanced. It was also stated in mill
circles that the majority of the union
men were ready to return to work, but
that the leaders were keeping thepi
from doing so. Accordingly it was de
cided to submit the question to a vote
to-day. In a total of 1821 ballots cast
there was a majority of 971 in favor of
continuing.
This was the first formal vote on the
question taken since the action of the
unions In July beginning the strike.
The labor secretaries say the vote to
day shows that the union operatives
are Just as determined as ever to con
tinue the struggle. The union opera
tives, they assert, reflect the opinion
of a large majority of the help who
are not affiliated with any of the
unions.
The manufacturers expressed disap
pointment at the action taken by the
unions. They said, however, that there
was no hope of a restoration of the
12% per cent reduction and they pro
posed to continue attempts to run the
miils under the same conditions as they
have for the last seven weeks.

District Judge Dole has rendered an
Important decision on the question of
the right of the Territorial Board of
Health to segregate lepers. The matter
came up in the form of an application
for a writ of habeas corpus to obtain

held asj lepers, had the right to an open

and the question of fact is now to be
tried to ascertain whether the woman is
a leper or not.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â President
Roosevelt Is devoting some time at
present to the consideration of im
portant appointments in the diplomatic
and consular service of the Govern
ment, which are to be made formally
by him next March. Secretary Hay
had a conference -with the President
to-day before the meeting of the Cabi
net, and it is understood that the mat
ter of appointments in the diplomatic
service was one of the subjects dis
cussed.
While no official announcement of
the President's intention regarding the
positions . has yet been made, it is
known that he has decided upon sev
eral changes. Joseph H. Choate, Em
bassador to the Court of St. James,
has indicated that he does not desire
longer to continue es representative of
this Government in Great Britain, and
he expects, when relieved, to return to
America to look after his personal in
terests here. He will be succeeded by
Whitelaw Reid," proprietor of the New
York Tribune, who was at one t'*ae
Minister to France.
PORTER WILL RETIRE.
General Horace Porter, American
Embassador to France, will retire from
that post soon after March 4. He was
appointed by President McKinley, and,
with the expiration of his present term,
will have served the United States at
the French capital eight years. The
President has decided on General Por
ter's successor, but at this time no an
nouncement of his decision can be
made.
Charlemagne Tower, American Em^
bassador to Germany, and Robert S.
McCormick, American Embaasador to
Russia, will 4 continue at their respec
tive posts.
Bellamy Storer,. American "Embassa
dor to Austria-Hungary, will continue
Â«.n his present place until the President
decides to transfer him to another post
in the diplomatic service.
As to the Embassadorshlp to Italy
nothing of a definite nature can be said
now. It has been rumored that Km
bassador George von L. Meyer is to
succeed General Porter at Paris, but
it can be said that such a change Js
not certain. The probabilities are that
Embassadcr Meyer will remain at
Rome.
General Powell Clayton, having de
cided to relinquish his post as Embas
sador to Mexico at the end of the pres
ent administration, will be succeeded
by Edwin H, Conger, now United
States Minister to China. It is not
expected that Conger will continue
long at the Mexican capital, as it Is
understood that he intends to return
tc his home State of Iowa to be a can
didate to succeed Governor Cummins.
SLATED FOR MEXICO.
Clayton will be succeeded by David E.
Thompson of Nebraska, who at pres
ent is Minister to Brazil. Thompson
uccepted the appointment to Brazil
with the understanding that he would
be appointed to a higher place in the
diplomatic service as soon as oppor
tunity afforded,
Minister Conger will be succeeded at
the court of Peking by William W.
Rockhill, at present director of the
Bureau of American Republics, who is
recognized as an authority on all sub
jects pertaining to China and the Chi
nese.
John K. Gowdy, who was appointed
by - President McKinley as American
Consul General at Paris, will be suc
ceeded by Frank H. Mason, who is now
Consul General to Berlin. In succes
sion to Mason John Lewis Griffiths of
Indianapolis will be named.
It Is expected that some other
changes will be made in the corps of
American Ministers, but at this time
they are not obtainable for pub

BARRIE'S STAR
IN ASCENDANT
Now Disputes With Pinero
the Title of the Fore
most English Dramatist
HIS MASY. SUCCESSES
Dancing Doll Fails to Draw
Londoners to Theater and
It Is to Be Taken Off
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
LONDON, Dec. 30.â For several years
Henry. Arthur Jones was -in a position
to dispute Pinero's title of foremost
English dramatist more or less success
fully, but of late Jones has dropped
out of the running and given place to
the witty and resourceful author of
"The Little Minister." Since Pinero
made his last big hit Barrie has made
three with "Crlchton," "Quality Street"
and "Little Mary." Probably he will hit
it off again with the new play which
he wrote a while ago for Ellen Terry.
In the meantime the most eagerly
awaited item of the season is Barrie's
new fantasy for children â and older
folk, too â which he calls "Peter Pan;
or. The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up."
This is a fairy story in three acts, and
no one who read "The Little White
Bird" will need to be told that it re
veals the author in his happiest and
most, original mood. r The piece will be
produced at the Duke of York's, and if
It pleases Londoners will be given in
the United States early in the new year.
A REAL FAIRYLAND.
Its hero, Peter Pan, is a boy, who
has the misfortune to overhear his
parents discussing what they will make
of him when he grows up, whereupon
he determines never to grow up and
promptly starts for fairyland. This
fairyland, by the way, is by no means
of the pantomime order, but that of a
child's imagination â filled with pirates,
redskins, crocodiles, wolves and other
fearsome things, such as Barrie loves
to think about. There will be a touch
of pathos, too. In one of the scenes,
which will show tender-hearted moth
ers who have lost their little ones seek
ing for their boys or girls.
It is promised that the scenic effects
of this play will be of the most aston
ishing kind. The cast which will give
the play in London will be a particu
larly strong one, including Nina Boucl
cault, who made such a hit in "Little
Mary"; Gerald du Maurier and Pauline
Chase, the erstwhile "pink pajama
girl." v
PIXERO'S DOLL A BORE.
Fifty-eight performances has ended
Pinero's comedy, "A Wife Without a
Smile." Certainly no play ever got a
more magnificent advertisement than
was bestowed gratuitously upon this
"comedy in disguise," but all the talk
about the doll's suggestiveness and all
the fits thrown by Stead failed to draw
the London public for more than eight
weeks.
One would have thought that Stead's
declaration that he had been "made to
laugh at hell" and the somewhat hys
terical appeals to the Censor of other
critics would have resulted in the
doll's dancing for 500 nights. No doubt
it would have, had the public also
found the play immoral. Instead, it
seems to have found it merely-'a bore,
and so the "Doll's House," as some one
dubbed Wyndham's Theater, will close
on Saturday evening next.
It wilPdo Pinero's reputation no
good. Perhaps as it Is the author of
"Quex" ought to be grateful, for if it
had not been for the discussion over
the antics of the doll probably "A
Wife 'Without a Smile" would not have
run for a fortnight. But it's four years
or so since Pinero had a real success
and . those are not lacking who affirm
that the premier playwright is written
out. "Iris" was a comparative failure,
and "Letty," which William Faver
sham is now using at home, had hard
ly 100 nights to its credit when it fin
ished at the Duke of whereas
"The Gay Lord Quex" was played 400
times or more.
What must make the situation espe
cially annoying to Pinero is the fact
that his younger rival, J. M. Barrie, Is
going stronger than ever.
"FAUST" UP TO DATE.
Owen Hall has an original turn of
mind, and for the new burlesque,
which he is writing for George Ed
wardes, he has hit on a rather novel
idea. He has written a new version of
"Faust,", in which Mephistopheles be
comes a policeman and escorts Mar
guerite around the town. When com
pleted the new burlesque will be pro
duced at the Gayety. George Dance,
who wrote "A Chinese Honeymoon," is
helping Hall with his libretto.
A new play by Captain Marshall,
who wrote "The Duke of Klllicrankie,"
will be produced in London by Charles
Frohman about the end of January.
Eva Westcott, the American girl who
came over with the "Prince of Pilsen"

BISHOP'S FRIENDS
STAND ACCUSED
OF INTIMIDATION
HERBERT NOBLE MAKE8CHARGE
Says They Caused Refiudia
tion of the Presentment
Against Talbot.
v. PHILADELPHIA, Dec SO.â Herbert
Noble of New York, one of the leading
figures In the controversy between Dr.
Talbot and Rev. Mr. Irvine, who has
been here Jn connection with the case,
said to-night that intimidation had
been practiced in getting the Hunting
don signers to repudiate tha present
ment against the Bishop.
"The friends of Bishop Talbot," ha
said, 'had an agent at work, and we
know who this agent is. We have had
detectives on the case, and to-morrow
we will make a statement and disclose
aU? the facts to the public. We know
this agent has done his best to break
the powerful presentment, and the re
pudiations are the result.
"Even if the Huntingdon signers do
Insist upon repudiating the presentment
it will not invalidate the instrument,
which even then would have more
signers than are necessary."
Noble held a conference with J. Fred
erick Jenklnson and Agnew McBride,
two of' the Philadelphia signers of the
presentment, and Rev. W. B. Bodlne,
who is chairman of the board of in
quiry that will hear the case at Read-
Ing, Pa., next month.
W. A. Wilson, another Philadelphia
signer, confirmed the statement made
by (the Huntingdon signers that they
signed a blank sheet of paper, but add
ed that all the presenters attached
their names to the original paper. The
signatures to the blank paper, he said,
was for the purpose of making another
copy of the presentment If one was
found necessary.
Opinion is still divided as to whether
the board of inquiry, owing to a new
canon going into effect on January 1,
will have the right to take up the case.
It Is now believed that nothing will be
done until the board meets on January
10, when the members of that body will
themselves decide the question.
Dr. Irvine held a conference with
Noble and Hartwell P. Heath of New
York, Noble's partner, which lasted
until after midnight. When Dr. Irvine
was informed that the Huntingdon
signers persist in declaring that they
did not knowingly sign a petition
against BlshoD Talbot, he made the
following statement:
"I have no knowledge as to how the
signatures to the presentment were ob
tained. I have certainly misrepresented
no feature of the case to any one. I
sent the presentment through the mails
to W. S. Miller of Huntingdon to obtain
the signatures of those persons rn the
city willing to sign a presentment. I
have the utmost faith in the honesty,
straightforwardness and uprightnesss
of Mr. Miller, and I do not think he
used any dishonorable means to secure
the signatures of those men whose
names appear upon the presentment."
MRS. ELLIOTT PLEASED.
Hears of Repudiation by Some of the
Signers.
HUNTINGTON, Pa., Dec. 30. â
There is no abatement here in the in
terest In the controversy between Dr.
Irvine, the deposed rector /of St.
John's Church, and Bishop Talbot of
the Central Pennsylvania diocese. Es
pecial interest was taken in the state
ments of some of the local signers
that they had unwittingly signed the
presentment.
James Denithorne, one of the men
whose names are on the presentment,
came out with a statement to-day, in
which he said:
When the subject of a review of the case
was first broached to me it was In the shape
of a nicely worded letter from Dr. Irvine to
Mr. Htllier. The letter asked that a review
of the controversy be petitioned for with the
idea of an amicable settlement of the differ
ences between Bishop Talbot and Dr. Irvine.
For the sake of the church Mr. Lanrdon and
myself thought It would be best to have tha
case reviewed.
Mrs. Elliott appeared to be pleased
when she learned that some of the
Huntington signers had repudiated
the presentment. She said:
I knew there was something wrong about
the proceedings and I do not think they will
have much difficulty In finding the source of
the trouble. I thought It was strange that
John Langdon would appear as a presenter of
charges against the Bishop, who confirmed
him only last spring and whom he entertained
at his home and table.
Henry W. Petriken, Mayor of this
city and one of the witnesses called to
the Reading inquiry, was the attorney
for Dr. Irvine in the church and civil
trials here. He says he does not see
how the inquiry can proceed if the
names of any of the signers are re
pudiated. He said:
That. repudiation must be made In a formal
statement to the court of Inquiry, otherwise
the presentment will hold and the court havÂ«
Jurisdiction. There is something: strange about
the entire proceedings and I am not qualified
to express an opinion until I learn more of
the facto.
James Denithorne declared to-night
that' Miller hadN^ceived a telegram
from Dr.. Irvine in which the un
frocked priest asked Miller not to say
anything and that he had written each
of the presenters a letter explaining
the alleged misrepresentation.
In reiterating his statement that he
did not knowingly sign the present
ment, John - Langdon, the. coal oper
ator, said to-day:
I am fully convinced that a plot was formed
to set Denithorne and me Into this controversy.
Dr. Irvine hoped that our influence would
lend weight to his case against Bishop Talbot
We will Get after both Irvine and this man
Miller and the whole truth will come out.
TALBOT REMAINS SILENT.
His Wife Would Have Him Make a
Statement. ,
SOUTH BETHLEHEM, Pa., Dec.
30.â Bishop Talbot's friends have
vainly urged him to make some state
ment for publication. Mrs. Talbot
said to-day:
- w - 1 .' only , wlih thÂ« Bishop would talk freÂ«ly

ANOTHER 3IAX ACCUSED.
Said to Have Given Confidential Let-
ter to Dr. Irvine.
NEW YORK, Dec 30.â ThÂ» Hsrald
will gay to-morrow regarding: tha Tal
bot case: Charges of a serious nature
are to be made at the Talbot hearing
against the person who Is responsible
for the delivery to Dr. IrvlnÂ© of. a copy
of a confidential letter addressed by
the Bishop to the Rev. Dr. Samuel Up
john 'of Philadelphia. It Is reporttd
that the original document is in tha
possession of the Bishop himself, and
was not destroyed. The copy, on which
the charges of libel and falsehood
against the Right Rev. Dr. Talbot were
based, was obtained from a duplicate
sent to the Rev. John Fulton, -who dis
claims all responsibility for the act.
Dr. Fulton knows who is responsible
for the delivery of a copy to Dr. Irvine,
It is reported, and he will brine an ac
cusation against him.
MAY BE A HITCH.
>*ew Canons Likely to Interfere With
the Case.
BOSTON, Dec SO. â Charles O.
Saunders of this city, one of the lead
ing authorities on canon law of tha
Episcopal church, is of tha opinion
that the. proceedings instituted under
the laws will be uncanonical after Jan
uary 1, the day the new canons
adopted at the triennial convention In
Boston in October become effective.
The opinion of Saunders is consid
ered important, as he was secretary
cf the committee of revision of the
canons and the member of the last
House of Deputies, who formally pre
sented the revised laws to that body
There is no provision In the new
canons for the disposition of the cases
begun under the old laws which may
be pending when the revised canons
go into effect.
If Bishop Tuttle decides that the
existing presentment against Bishop
Talbot is Irregular the present pro
ceedings can be dropped and a new
presentment made to conform to the
provisions of the revised canons.

JAPAN RECOGNIZES POWER OF PRESS
Allows More Lat
itude to Cor
respondents.
Writers From
Front Return
on China.
Two war correspondents direct from
the front arrived from the Orient yes
terday on the lin?r China. Franklin
Clarken has been with the Japanese in
Manchuria, representing the Kew York
Evening Post, and Alexander Graham-
Simpson of the London Daily Tele
gTaph was withlhe Russians until the
Japanese captured him at Liaoyang.
Clarken is the first correspondent to
come home without a grievance against
the Japanese. Before he left the front
i he bars behind which an army of war
correspondents rusted for so many
month* were let down and with few
restrictions the men with the pen werÂ£
given the run of the fighting zone..
Clarken witnessed the battle of the"
Shihliho and there saw the Japanese
infantry and artillery in full action
for six days. ,
The Japanese wou'.d not allow the
correspondents to see their cavalry', of
which they ar<? not particularly proud,
in action and stipulated that though in
eyery other respect the newspaper
men's movements would be unrestrict
ed, they must always be accompanied
by a Japanese officer. The reason for ,
this, says Clarken, is that many of the
Japanese troops have never seen a
white man. To them all not Japanese
are Russians and as these untraveled
Japs are in Manchuria for the purpose
of ridding the land of the Czar's sub
jects, none of the correspondents were
anxious to take chances of a mix-up
in Identity.
Clarken does not believe there will
be any winter fighting ynlessthe^Rusr
*ians take the aggressive. "Tfie Japan
ese army in Manchuria, he says, is
sadly in need of a rest and most of the
regiments are mere skeletons of their
original strength. ' The veterans must
rest and recruits are a necessityi as
the Russians are slowly but surely
gaining in strength. Many troops have;'
been withdrawn from Manchuria and
taken to Port Arthur, the siege of
which ha6 been terribly expensive in
Japanese lives.,
Alexander Graham-Simpson was with
the Russians but has little praise for
the Slav. Kuropatkin, he says, is one
the' world's greatest generals, but is
handicapped by the poor material of
which his army is composed. The Rus
sian officers are incompetent, says the
British correspondent, and the men
woefully ignorant. Few of the men
know what they are fighting for. and
the rest do not want to fight. Of the
Russian enlisted men only 25 per cent
can read or write. Many of the Cos
sacks, be says, had expected to find
the Japanese armed with bows and
arrows and were greatly surprised' to
find a foe that not only carried up-to
date arms but knew a few things
about their use.
Grah?.m-Simpson believes that Rus
sian supremacy In the Orient would be
a real peril to the rest of the world and
declares Russia the most warlike na
tion on oarth.
The London Telegraph's representa
tive was captured at Liaoyang. As
a Britisher he is leisurely in his move
ments. The Russians retired with some
haste and before Graham-Simpson re
alized that a retreat was in progress,
he found himself in the. middle of the
Japanese army. He was sent under
escort back to Japan. He was treated
kindly, he says, and as his capture
came at a time when he was growing
very tired of Russian companionship,
he rather enjoyed the experience.
Another passenger on the China was
Commander M. Tanaka of the Japan
ese navy, who is going to London to In
spect certain purchases of war supplies
for 'the Mikado's navy. Tanaka says:
"I understand no English," and with
bows Â«nd smiles declares, in panto
mime, that upon his word of honor,
that small sentence is the limit of his
acquaintance with the language of his
very dear friends, the American news
paper men. ERSB

DEFICIT SHOWN
AT YEAR'S END
Expenditures Have Exceeded
Receipts' of the Nation
by Twenty-Two Millions
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â The Treas
ury Department to-day Issued a review
of treasury operations for the calendar
year 1904. The treasury receipts for
the calendar year i904 were 5540,000,000,
and the expenditures (including the
Panama payment) 5562,000,000 â a deficit
for the year of 522,000,000. As compared
with the previous calendar year the
receipts show a falling off of $8,000,000
and the expenditures an increase of
550,000,000. Civil and miscellaneous ex
penditures increased- 515,000,000; War
Department expenses, 59,000,000; Navy
Department expenses, $23,000,000; pen
sions, 52,000,000, and interest 51,000,000.
The Increase in interest is due to the
fact that a portion of the . interest of
1903 was : 'anticipated in 1902. The fig
ures do not include the postal receipts
and _ expenditures except that the pos
tal deficit, is- included in the civil and
miscellaneous expenditures.'
Imports for.. the .first' eleven . months
of 1904 were 5939,000,000â an" increase
over' the corresponding period of. 1903
of $22,000,000. Imports free of duty for
the same period increased $42,000,000,
while dutiable Imports decreased 520,
000,000. In 1903 43% per cent of the im
ports were free of 'duty,' while In 1904
47 per cent were free of duty.. Practi
cally the entire increase in free im
ports was in three articles â coffee, in
diarubber and raw silk. Although du
tiable imports decreased 520,000,000, raw
sugar and wool show increases aggre
gating $28,000,000. All other dutiable
imports decreased nearly $50,000,000. Of
this decrease $20,000,000 was in Iron and
steeL
Other noteworthy features of the
treasury transactions in 1904 were the
payment out of accumulated surpluses
of $50.000,000. for the right of way for
the Panama canal; the redemption of
the outstanding . 5 per cent bonds due
February 1, 1904, and the various calls
'on the national bank depositaries .for
the return of a portion of their public
deposits. The redemption of 5s during
the calendar year was , approximately
$6,000,000. Public fundson deposit with
the banks were red ucâ¬a" from $166,000,000
on January 1,. 1904, to $113,000,000 at the
close of the year. The colls on the
banks to mature early in 1905 will fur
ther; reduce these deposits and ' replen
ish the cash in the general fund of the
treasury to the extent . 523/JOO.OOO.
'The cash in the treasury, exclusive
of th& gold reserve and gold and silver
coin held against outstanding -certifi
cates, was $320,000,000 on January 1,
1904. At the close of the year it was
$240,000,000, a decrease of $80,000,000 for
the year.

Russian Writes of Existing Conditions
at Tort Arthur. .-': ; ' : C'; J
TOKIO, Dec. 30.â The Navy Depart
ment published to-night a letter written
by a man on_ the battleship .Sevastopol
which had fallen into the hands of the
Japanese. The writer despairs of the
relief of the fortress and tells of the
destruction wrought by Japanese
shells. He says the Russians are re
signed to their fate and are deter
mined to fight to a finish rather than
suffer, the shame of surrender owing to
starvation. Following is' the text of
the letter:
The fortress cannot resist after December.
Thf progress of the enemy In reducing our
principal line of outer defences is not fully
ki.ovvn. but it is irresistible.
We are sadly disappointed over the non
arrival of the second Pacific "squadron and are
daily nearing â  our miserable end.
General Stoessel's so-called Impregnable line
of outer defenses la now a myth:. With 203-
Meter Hill lost the fall of Port Arthur cannot
be avoided. Its capture by the Japanese means
the fall of the town, however strong the other
defenses. ' â  .
The new town is at the mercy of the enemy's
fire. The old town alone is defendable and
here alone may resistance be prolonged.
Two-thirds of the defenders of 203-Mete?
Hill were lost.
The Sevastopol, which was exposed to the
enemy's tire in the daytime, on the night of
December 8. without being towed, left the
harbor with only 111 instead of her comple
ment of CCO souls. When she. went out she
had her nets down, but was struck . twice
by the enemy's torpedoes and was beached.
Irreparably damaged. General Stoessel highly
praised the officers and crew of the ship.
Fuel Is almost unobtainable and It is Im
possible to keep our bodies -.warm. Â»
We no. longer have a wireless telegraph sys
tem and have no means of ' communicating
with the outside' world, -v Our Isolation is com
plete.. There .is no news, .and .we, have had
no Information for a lone; 'time;'* *' ]
It la impossible to smuggle ammunition.
The captain of the King" Arthur brought only
barley. Â«^ 7;.
(The King Arthur,. British, steamer,
was cautpred December 19, while at
tempting to leave Port Arthur, by; the
Japanese guardship Asagari. She had
on board Russian naval officers who
were attempting to join the Russian
Second Pacific Squadron.' She Is now
at Sasebo undergoing trial.)
There is a large hole in the Hull of the
Sevastopol and she is completely disabled.
All that remains for those on board her Is
to do their utmost In repulsing the enemy's
attacks. â  â 
The enemy's torpedo-boats came close to
the Sevastopol and attacked her as if they
were going through ordinary maneuvers.
Should the Sevastopol sink we are to land
at a place already decided upon. All are,
however, prepared to fight to the very last.
On us of the Sevastopol depends the duty of
retaining the honor of the navy and avoiding
the shame and humiliation of threatened star
vation. We would rather die than be â  thus
shamed.
From December 1 the enemy's ten-Inch shells
began to fall on the . deck of the Sevastopol
and some of them pierced through the decks
to the bottom of the ship. < - ~
\Vho Is responsible for the fate we face?
It Is he who did not give instructions for
the prevention of a' Japanese landing on the
Ltaotuni Peninsula, ...
Among our officers there, are very few who
dare" to brave death,' the majority having no
other desire than to save their own lives, but
â we are determined to die fighting.
WATCHING THE ASKOLD.
Steptf Taken to Prevent Escape of the
.Russian Cruiser./
SHANGHAI, . Dec. 30.â The Taotai
continues to take stridt precautions to
prevent the possible escape of the Rus
sian cruiser Askold and the. torpedo
boat destroyer Grozovoi, which vessels
it has been reported contemplate mak
ing an effort to. join the Russian second
Pacific squadron.
The Taotai has been instructed by the
foF^ign board at Peking. to insist upon
a reply from the Russian Consul to his 1
demand for. the surrender of the sailor
belonging to the cruiser Askold who on
December, 15 murdered a Chinaman on
the Bund here as the' result of a dis
pute over .payment for the hire of a
jiririksha.
Should the Consul decline to comply
with this demand, the Chinese authori
ties here say, it will be apparent that
Russia contemplates .a serious breach
of the neutrality of China, and that
henceforth China cannot undertake to
protect Russians In Chinese ' harbors
against actions of the Japanese.

port in circulation to the effect that
General Kuropatkin Is 111.
The rumors that the Russian com
mander-ln-chief is about to assume the
offensive are not confirmed by the gen
eral staff, where it is pointed out that
with the thermometer at zero (Fahren
heit), it is Impossible to begin a move
ment on a large scale without the risk
of appalling horrors.
S. A. Alexandrovsky, formerly In
charge of the Russian Red Cross work
in the Far East, who has been suc
ceeded by Prince Vassilitchkoff, has
accepted General Kuropatkin's offer
to act "as chief of the sanitary depart
ments of one of the armies. â  ..-;.'
The old Red Cro^s scandals are now
receiving a thorough ventilation in the
papers. Vast quantities of supplies
went astray during the summer and
early autumn. One hundred out of
one hundred and twenty bales from
Moscow alone disappeared, and the de
mand is made for the punishment of
those responsible. ... .
The precautions now taken effective
ly prevent a recurrence of the disap
pearance of supplies. The Emperor
has sent a personal . aide de camp to
see that their transportation is not In

PLAN TO CUT
EXPENSES DOWN
Assemblyman Waste Tells of
Proposed Movement to Se
duce Cost of Legislation
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 30.âAssembly
man. William H. Waste, who has been
returned to the Legislature again this
year, is authority for the statement
that a tremendous effort is to be made
at the opening of the present session
to cut down the patronage to a mini
mum. Waste Is acung in conjunction
with Governor Pardee in the move for
economy, and has been busily engaged
during the last few weeks correspond
ing with' all the Assemblymen-elect
with the view of securing their co-op
eration. ' Assemblyman Waste said:
The total expense entailed In the hiring of
clerks during the last session was $158,155.
This sum was divided Into $71,183 for the Sen.
ate and $86,972 for the Assembly. Each Sen
ator . received $20 in patronage and each As
semblyman $12. It Is the Idea of Governor
Pardee that these sums can be considerably
reduced without â  omfttiny provision for a
single attache who is absolutely needed. Both
the Governor and I. feel that .the Assemblymen
could get 'along with $4 patronage each.
. The sentiment of the older mepnbers of tho
Legislature Is that a great reduction must be
madeSn the patronage this year on account of
the large increase In the number of Republi
can representatives In both Houses. Among
the Assemblymen from whom I have received
letters favoring a reduction in patronage are:
Cromwell of Petaluma, Ells of Stege. Trtpp
of Santa Rosa. Olmstead . of San Rafael. Hou
ser and Johnstone of â  Los" Angeles, â  Moore and
Beardslee of â  San Joaquln, Chandler of Selma,
Duryea of Placer, Devlin of Solano and Strow.

-Although the State Legislature is
scheduled to open in three days very
few members of either house have ar
rived ' in Sacramento. A large, number
of , the lawmakers who came here to se
cure headquarters and apartments have
returned to their homes In various parts
of the State to return at a later date.
: . Although next'Monday is a legal hol
iday, the . Legislature will convene, ac
cording to the law which requires the
session to open on the first Monday in

tirement from the International com

quacity, are denied at both the Ad
miralty and Foreign Office, where it Is

ly' to the condition of his health. It
is also intimated that Admiral Baron
von Spaun of the Austrian navy, the
fifth member of the commission, may
also retire because his health cannot
support the strain.

'Tin de walkln' dlllygate of de bumi 1

Poiice Judge Conlan's Query as to his
ir-eacs of obtaining sustenance. Then,
seeing that his facetiousness failed of
appreciation, he hastily added, "!>â¢

f hat's what he was arrested forâ
begging.â end Patrolman Walsh testi
fied that a Jollier mendicant never came
under his observation. The officer had
haaurd * several funny stories anent Mr.
Xellson's professional methods, some
of which he recounted to the court.
Approaching; a group of post-prandial
Fmokers at the Occidental's main en
trance Mr- Xeilson picked up from the
gutter a half-consumed cigar. Inserted
it between his teeth, blew a fragrant
cloud and, addressing the loungers,
said: "Gents. I'd join youse, only I'm
made ineligible by de fact dat I does
me smokin' before .dinner Instead of
after it. I never smokes after dinner
'cause I never has no dinner ter smoke
after." &â ';.â¢<*
POn another occasion he entered a
!ace where men deal In stocks, and,
Feeing a well-known .broker standing
stiffly and wrapped in mental calcula
tion, he . slapped him cordially on the
shoulder and shouted: "Brace up, kid!
Happy days is a-coinin'. I've bin a tin
horn gambler meself an' knows wat de
feelin's of a loser is."
When he recovered from the effects
cf his violent ejection from the col
lateral, mart Mr. Nellson betook him to
a cigar store much favored by men of
finance, where he drew from one of his
pockets a handful of earth and dis
played It to' those present. Replying In
the negative to a question as to wheth

business, he explained: "Dis wot I'm
a-.showin' youse is me bed fer ter-nlght,
en' wid fie price of a eupper in me
odder hen* I'd go on me way rejoicin'."
He was given cause to rejoice.
But the most amusing thing told by
the policeman was his own experience
with the jovial beggar. After a three
days' game of hide and seek the pur
suer ar.d the pursued met face to face
on Pine street, and when the officer
stretched forth a hand to clutch Mr.
Neilson it was cordially grasped by
that gentleman. **W*y. Mr. Walsh," he

Judge Mogan's court was graced by
the presence of British blue blood
adolescent, but pureâ In the persons
of Edward Van der Linden, who will
acquire the title of Count with his ma
jority, and John Frederick Forbes
Elmsley, whose ancestral home Is at
Hampton Wick. The lads are mid
shipmen aboard the ship Lynton and
they appeared as complaining -wit
nesses against a young Afro-American
eneak thief of the name of George
William Figg. recently arrived here
from Louisville. Ky. He was thrice
charged with burglary and the testi
mony proved pretty conclusively that
he it was who entered the midship
men's sleeping quarters aboard the
Lynton and stole therefrom various
articles of wearing apparel, the prop
erty of Count-to-be Van der Linden
and J. F. F. Elmsley; also that he
invaded the forecastle of the British
ship Eva Montgomery and abstracted
therefrom some go-ashore garments
owned by Gus Milander and John
Oberscheneider, able seamen, who also
appeared in court and identified their
clothing.
There also appeared as a witness
one Edward Lageere, a whaler, and of
the same race as the defendant. It
â¢wap Mr. Lageere's purchase of a Van
der Linden overcoat of white melton
end silk lined and his wearing of
the eame that led to Mr. Figg's ar
rest. Mr. Lageere gave Mr. Figg 50
cents for the coat and then strutted
along Pacific street to give Miss
Anastasia Johnson an eye feast and
when thus engaged he was seen and
the coat recognized by J. F. F. Elms
ley, who Informed the detective that
did the rest-
No defense was offered and Mr.
Figg will surely be remanded to the
upper court just as soon as his Honor
Mogan has heard another witness or
t^\ o. Â»
Fourteen-year-old Ernest Gloss of
1316 Broderick street did not desire to
have his hair cut, ana when the other
boys carried him into the barber shop
at California and Devisadero streets he
so informed the presiding tonsor. It
was true. Master Gloss admitted, that
the football season has lapsed and
boys' coiffures a la chrysanthemum are
no longer correct, but he preferred be
ing out of fashion to endangering his
health by having his thick thatch re
moved while the chill weather re
mained. While the fellows might laugh
at him, he would rather be a butt for
their derisive persiflage than have a
cold in his head. But his arguments
had no more of a restraining effect on
his custodians or their adult abettor
than did his struggles or his implora-
tions. The boys planted him in the
chair and held him there while the
jocular barber, thoroughly imbued with
the spirit of their joke, applied comb
and scissors to little Ernest's heavy
hair crop.
When the shearing was about half
finished It simultaneously occurred to
the practical jokers that the fun of the
thing would be much enhanced by ceas
ing the operation right there and com
pelling Ernest to go abroad with head
semi-denuded, so they gleefully jerked
him from the chair and cast him forth
with the left section of his caput sug
gestive of Paderewskl or a divine heal
er and the right division as closely
cropped as a convict's. When he ar
rived at home and told and showed hi?
relatives what had been done to him
they not only declined . to regard the
incident * from the barber's viewpoint,
but at once proceeded to direct that
person's arrest on the charge of mali
cious mischief. As they did not know
his name the warrant was issued for
John Doe, and he will be permitted, to
disclose his real cognomen to Judge
Cabaniss.
Ernest's guardians have had another
barber complete the job begun by the
joker. If the charge of malicious mis
chief fails to stick, the same defendant
may be accused of petty larceny, he
having kept the hair which he cut from
Ernest's head.
"How old is Ann?" -was the query
that started the discord and led to the
arrest of A. J. Hoffner. a tugboat
skipper, on the charge of having bat
tered Peter Teheney of "205 Twenty

Alva Adama, Democratic candidate
for Governor, who appeared from the
returns to have been elected but whoi
has declared that he does not want tha
office if It is tainted with fraud, asked
the court to open every Denver ballot
box, but the order of the court goes
beyond the mere examination of . bal
lots. It provides for an investigation
of. the registration -lists, the campaign
expenditures and, in brief, all election
matters.
Attorney Samuel W. Belford for Ad
ams and Attorney Henry J. Herseyfor
the Republicans asked the court to
make its order of such breadth that
the court need not stop at anything in
the investlgttlon. The court said that
was what it meant to do, and Instruct
ed the lawyers to agree upon the word-
Ing of the order and present it to the
court for approval next Tuesday morn-
Ing. .
MAXY FRAUDULENT BALLOTS.
As there are 204 ballot boxes it is evi
dent that several months will- be con
sumed in the examination of their con
tents by two handwriting experts to'be
appointed for this work. It is expected
that the Supreme Court will be asked
to make an order placing special watch
ers at thÂ£ Courthouse to guard the reg
istration books until such time as the
investigation is made.
"There are probably 20,000^fraudulent
registrations on the books of the city
and countv of Denver," said Attorney
James H. Brown, the principal adviser
of the Republican City Central Com
mittee, to-day.
F. A. Williams, chairman of the,Re
publican committee, has published the
following statement over his signature:
Our Investigation into the conduct of the
recent election in Denver has developed the
fact that approximately 20,000 fraudulent votes
â were cast or counted for Alva Adams In this
city. There is now no reasonable doubt that
Governor Peabody and thÂ« entire | Republican
State ticket was fairly elected on November
8 by the votes of a large majority of ths
legal voters of this State.
PEABODY IS PLEASED.
What effect, If any, the court's ac
tion to-day will have upon the course
of the Legislature in respect to can
vassing the vote for Governor and de
termining whether Peabody; or.' Adams
is entitled to the seat 'has not yet be
come apparent. -'.;':
Republicans as well as Democrats ad
mit that the opening, of all the Denver
boxes complicates the political situa
tion in Colorado, but believe that It
means that there will be no , "rough
house," as predicted.
Governor Peabody expressed himself
as follows regarding the court's deci
sion:
I am more than pleased that thÂ« Supreme
Court has decided to open every ballot-box in
were among the persons .who called on
the first named gentleman's sister to
extend the compliments . of the holi
day season and while the four sat and
gossiped Mr. Teheney, in facetious
mood, asked Captain Hoffner, "How
old Is Ann?" and the querist's sister
laughed heartily. Now as Miss Lyons
was no nursling and as .the gallant
mariner had never heard of the pop
ular arithmetical problem, . he - ac
cepted the question as an unflattering
commentary on bis .fiancee's. age and
promptly administered rebuke -by
punching one of Mr. TeheneVs eyes.
To prevent further., hostilities the la
dles grabbed and held Peter and hys
terically informed the captain that his
blow was , unprovoked. Inasmuch ; as
"How old Is Ann ?" was an everyday
byword, but Peter broke away, from
their clutch, kicked his assailant to
the street and there had -him placed
under arrest.
Miss Lyons , testified in Peter's be
half before Judge . Cabanlss, saying,,
that he : dld not intend "to wound, her
feelings when he asked the' captain
"How old .is Ann?"; ( Then' the" case
was continued thirty ' days, _ by which
time, the court hoped, Mr." Teheney
and Captain . Hoffner will have i talked
it over and effected a settlement with
out the law's aid. * -
Miss Lyons, It -may not -be amiss to
add, has seen about forty winters and
is quite' buxom.
With a view to reforming the charac
ter of the Baltimore House, . erstwhile
to the police as an opium den,
the new proprietors of the place, Emile
Robbin and JohnAnglade. jointly eject
ed therefrom at <r o'clock ' yesterday
morning one W. J. Meyers, and so vio
lently did they handle him that a po
liceman arrested them for battery. Ac
cording to the testimony of Mr. Mey
ers, he was roaming the corridors of
the second story In quest of' a lady
whom - he suspected of residing there,
when Messrs. Robbin and Anglade
knocked him down ' and - then. 'each 'of
them grasping one, of his legs, dragged
him Mr: Robbin asked
Judge Mogan : how the fair reputation
of the house ' was to be ' retrieved if Its
managers were . to\be prevented chuck-
Ing out persons whose; presence would
retard their reformatory endeavor.'. His
Honor has given; himself till Jamary 7

Marshal Chandler . upon a warant
charging " the' bankers with a violation

SCIENTIFIC SUGAR TEST
REQUIRED BY TARIFP ACT
Appraisers Hold That the Ordinary
Commercial Method Is Not
Sufficient.
NEW YORK, Dec . 30.â The . quality
of sugar for tariff purposes must be
determined by the scientific polariscope
test, according to a decision announced
to-day by the United States General
Appraisers. The decision was given on
a protest filed by -importers against a
recent ruling of the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals. The protest de
clared that the regulations upon which
the decision of the Circuit Court was
based were unconstitutional.' In over
ruling the protest, the board holds that
the phrases "testing, by the .polar
iscope" and "degree shown by the
polariscope" as used in the tariff act,
should be Interpreted literally. The
Protestants contended that the so
called trade test, or commercial test,
would have been sufficient under the
regulations.
The largest sugar Importers in the
country are interested in the settle
ment of the . question and it probably
will be taken to the United States Su
preme Court for final decision. The
amount involved in the case already
has reached many millions of dollars.
Denver, and my only regret is that every
box . in - the . State is., not opened. A point In
ravor.of the opening of the boxes by the
Supreme . Court is that it takes the matter
away from nplitlcs. There is confidence among
the public in ; what the Supreme Court does,
and when .the highest tribunal in the State is
through counting the votes in Denver it will
settle . beyond question who Is elected. I con
sider the decision of the court an eminently
wise, and Just one. -
It was announced this afternoon that
the Republican plan to unseat Demo
cratic Senators had been modified, and
that possibly only Senators Born and
Healy, who were seated by the Demo
cratic'majority on contests two years
ago,, would 'be turned out. â¢ ..;;
Itis also reported that on the advice
of influential Republicans the proposi
tion to memorialize the United States
Senate to unseat Henry M. Teller would
be abandoned. I - ; :
WANT ORDER MODIFIED.
Attorneys for Adams to-night notified
Attorney Hersey, representing the Re
publicans, that they would ask the Su
preme Court to modify- its order con
cerning the opening of the ballot boxes
In 1 Denver under the supervision of a
referee. ' â¢
They will request that i another ar
rangement; for paying the expenses of
the investigation" be made. The court;
having no funds, at its disposal for
meeting the expenses, directed. that the
two political parties divide it equally.
The Democrats object to this and will
request that the court find another way
for paying the cost . of the investiga
tion. The Republicans, who say they
areonly too willing to follow the sug>
gestloh of the court, pretend to see in
the- announcement: of -the Democrats'
attorney a. wish to avail themselves of
a loophole through which, to escape the
investigation \ they, themselves" inaug
urated.
The four , members of the State Can
vassing Board other than Governor
Peabody to-night Issued a signed state
ment in which! they, deny that there is
ajconsplracy to seat Governor Peabody,
and i express a. desire to see seated as
Governor the man who has been legally ;
elected." The statement reads:
The â¢ attitude of the "r State - Board â¢ of Can
vassers, of which. we are members, as to the
gubernatorial' controversy - having been mis
represented, and our motives â  questioned, we
feel that it Is' just and proper that the 'public
should "be. advised as to our real position.
FAVOR ACTION* OF COURT.
Our ; duties ' have been defined by the : courts
of â ]. the â¢â  State -and in the performance of sucn
duties we have been guided solely by the law.
I The action of the State Board of Canvassers
was taken without reference to any bearing it
might have on the gubernatorial contest. The
majority of the Joint 1 session of the Senate
and the House of Representatives would hav<Â»
bten overwhelmingly . Republican, regardless
of 'our *ict?on. â¢ â  .-,â¢
W e , favor the action taken by" the Supreme
Court to-day ; and urge that its findings and
order be accepted as final 'by the Legislature.
W( desire to eay that there Is no conspiracy
on* the part 1 of 'this board or any of its mem
bers to overthrow, the , will, of the "people or
attempt. to do so, but on .thÂ« contrary we hold
arid r adviee that whoever [ thÂ« recount of the
ballots, .under such rules as the Supreme Court
may prescribe, in the city and county â¢ of
Denver, . shows ; - to 'be elected, is entitled - to
the ' office of Governor, and we believe that
ail good citizens will' acquiesce In the result.
Whoever may . be seated as Governor â¢ wÂ»
desire that -the result be accomplished by
honest methods and that the will of tha people
may be supreme. â¢ , .

BOSTON OPENS
GREAT TUNNEL
Subway Connecting the Two
Portions of the City Is
Dedicated to Public Use
BOSTON, Dec 30. â The submarine
tunnel, connecting Boston and East
Boston, was opened for public travel
to-day. The dedication of the tunnel to
public use was carried out without any
formality.
Tha tunnel is double-tracked, 1.4
miles long, 2700 feet of which are under
the harbor waters. The cost of con
struction was $3,000,000. The tunnel
was built by the city of Boston, which
has leased it for a term of twenty-five
years, dating from 1S97, to the Boston
Elevated Railway Company, which will
use the tunnel exclusively for the
passage ' of its electric cars between
Boston and East Boston.
About four and a half years have
been consumed in constructing the tun
nel, in the accomplishment of which
many difficult engineering problems
had to be solved, chiefly on account of
the maze of underground pipes, sewers
and wires and also because of the peril
ous nature of the work of digging the
large passageway underneath the bed
jof the Boston harbor.
The tunnel is built entirely of con
crete and is the only tunnel of that kind
in the world. In arranging for the sta
tions, the builders made use of historic
ground, for the entrance near Wash
ington street Is directly under the old
Massachusetts State House, while' the
Scollay Square terminal Is underneath
the old Boston courthouse.

porations. In a paper upon "Govern

glomerations." -.'.-â  .- â ' ."""*/ '
His paper was read before a Joint ses
sion of I the - two associations and was
followed by; a'. general discussion. In
which President J. W. Jenks of Cornell
and E. : E- Prussing of Chicago took the
lead. - - >â¢ â¢ - ;
Regulation : of pools and railways by
the Government was also discussed at
the joint session. ,
Professor ". Adam Shortt of Queen's
University, Kingston.- Canada, read a
paper entitled â¢"Preferential Trade Be
tween Canada and' Great Britain." He
said in part:
Any iy*tÂ«m by which Britain and Caaad*
might. attempt, to tie themselves up to a mu
tually preferential trade Is open to rery seri
ous objections. I The colonies bar* no poaslbl*
compensation to offer Britain for the revolu
tion in. her.- foreign trade and shipping which
the adoption of â  a protective policy ' In their
interests would Involve. On the other hand
Canada Is a country undergoing rapid expan
sion, which has already Involved Important
changes' in her economic conditions, .with all
thÂ« varied possibilities of her Internal develop
ment acd future trade relations It would be
very unwlsa to tie herself up by hard and fast
commercial treaties with any country what
ever. ' m_ij> Â» ii|ij TWii"!
Entire fiscal frtedora is absolutely essential
to her effective expansion, and freÂ» trads in
capital Is more Important to her than - either
free trade or. preferential^ trade In goods.- So
far as preferential or freÂ« trade Is undertaken
by the Canadian Parliament in the interest of
Canada, - the action - is perfectly reasonable^
This la the ; basis of our existing preference
on British goods, and of our still greater prac
tical preference on American goods. LJke
treatment . of Canadian goods by other coun
tries which -realize- their need of them is ths
only permanent preference which we may hop*
for. Nothing .but friction.^ recrimination" and
bitterness . can " bÂ« â¢ the ultimate . outcome of a
preference founded on a sentimental Instead
of a business'' basis.
Professor 'A. W. Flux.of McGill Uni
versity, â  Montreal, . Canada, devoted
himself to the question,' VDo Reciprocal
Preferential Tariffs j Tend ' Toward Free
Trade?'" He" said: among other things:
Waiting for reciprocity has . deferred rather
than hastened ! movements I toward { freedom cf
commerce.. > Recent reciprocity * treaties cf the
United States . do â¢ not , Increase hopefulness of
the outlook lor advance by this road. ' In pro
tectionist -. communities â  a ' preferential tariff
tends to have, as its moet conspicuous feature,
an elevation of tariff rates â  to countries â¢ not
admitted to preferential treatment, rather than
a reduction of rates to preferred -nations. â¢
Little confidence seems justified at the pres
ent time in the reciprocity principle as a means
of effecting, general, tariff reductions.

Claiming that it is impossible for him
to get a fair and impartial trial in Ala
meda County, notice of a motion for a

Attorney,"^Vllen this afternoon by E, S.

Is charged with the murder of P.olice
man James H. Smith' last March.
The affidavit made by Kiniry in his
petition sets forth that the local press
has commented upon his case editorial
ly and' has already ( "tried, convicted,
hanged and consigned him to everlast
ing punishment." He states that Police
Judge Mortimer Smith, a brother of the
murdered man, is a politician and
known generally throughout -the coun
ty.. The police force, he asseris, will
use all its influence against him.
The murder of Policeman George W.
Brown under almost Fimilar circum

inflamed the public mind against- Kin
iry, -the demand for an example to
be. made as a warning to others has
been general. Under these circum
stances it is pleaded that nothing but
conviction stares Kiniry in the face and
that a trial here would be a mere farce.

PREPARES HIS
ANNUAL REPORT
President Wheeler Makes
Kecommendations to the
State Legislative Body.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Dec. 30.
' President Benjamin Ide" Wheeler has
given to the university printing office
the copy for his annual report to the
State Legislature. The report is con
sidered the most Important paper is
sued from the university during the
year, embodying, as it does, a compre
hensive review of the work accom
plished by the university. The presi
dent has permitted none to see copies' of
the document, and it is not to be made
public, in Its entirety, until the clerks
of the Assembly and Senate announce
that' they "have for reading a report,
from the president of the State Univer
sity." ;
It is known, however, that a principal
feature of the president's paper will be
his recommendation regarding the
needs of, the agricultural college of the
university. It is desired that the Leg
islature appropriate at least $200,000 for
a new agricultural college building, and
an appropriation for the establishing
of an experimental farm and dairy at
some convenient place outside of
Berkeley.
President Wheeler, instead of asking
.for'a number of small appropriations,
will suggest the giving of a lump sum/
to be expended as the h regents shall
deem best This action is in line with
the advice of the United States De
partment of Agriculture to President
Wheeler. The appropriation referred to
now, however, would not include the
money needed for the new agricultural
j college building, to be , erected .In .ac
cordance with the plans for the greater
university.
The State Farmers' Institute, held at
the university a- few months ago; ad
vised a -better understanding between
the University men and the agricultur
al interests. Resolutions were'.unahf
mously adopted, approving of the plan
to ask the Legislature for $200,000 for a
new' agricultural : college, and 'such
other moneys as might be needed.

In Presence of Son, Prisoner
Makes Threat That Leads
to an Additional Charge
Oakland Office S^an Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 30. '
From his cell in' the city prison Vin
cent! 'Addiago uttered a threat to-day
that he would cut out his wife's heart'
with a razor as soon as he gained his
liberty, no matter if he went to the
penitentiary for five years.' '"'
The murderous' declaration, heard by
Jailer. Bert .Curtis, Attorney James
Creeley and Frank Addiago,' the pris
oner's son, was the basis of the issu
ance of a second \ warrant of 'arrest,
against Addiago, ' already jailed on
charges of having brutally beaten and
kicked his spouse. '
Addiago was venting his wrath upon
Mrs. Addiago' because she had caused
his arrest on the battery charge upon
which he is awaiting trial. As soon
as that Is disposed of the more serious
threats will be taken up in court. â '-'â '.,
The prisoner, according to his wife,
has exhibited a bloodthirsty tendency
toward his family for months. Mrs. Ad
diago told the court officials that her
spouse had attempted to poison her
and their children,. Frank and Theresa,
by sprinkling rat poison on their
bread. She indicated that the $1500 life
insurance carried by herself and the
son was a motive for the deed.
; After hearing Addiago's utterances at
the city jail to-day Attorney Creeley
withdrew from the 'case. Attorney
W. H. O'Brien, who had also been con
sulted, declined to defend the man.

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Dec. 30.
The Cor.dllleran section of the Geo
logical Society of America held its
sixth annual session in South. Hall on
the University- campus to-day. r ; The
work of the session will not be-con
cluded until to-morrow night. Papers
oÂ£ .importance and, interest to the sci
entific world are . to be read in the
course of the session, the first of them
being under discussion to-day.
Professor John C. Merriam of the
geological department/ of the Univer
sity'of California was the first speak
er this morning, his subject being
"The Most Primitive Type of Ichthy
osaurian Limb." He brought with
him a specimen' limb from the mu
seum of. the university. . It Is part of
a [collection recently obtained from
the middle Triassic of Nevada and is
considered ah unusually good speci
men, showing the pro and apipodial
segments of an anterior limb. Pro
fessor Merriam declared that of ; all
the known ', ichthyosaurs this form
shows the most primitive forearm re
gion and' approaches most nearly the
type seen in. primitive shore reptiles.
This fact, he declared, is especially
significant when it is considered that
this is pfoably the oldest known spec
imen showing the limb elements.
The specimen upon which Pro'fessor
Merriam â¢ discoursed to the ' scientists
present was recently presented, with
other ' material 'of similar character, to
the university by Miss A. M. Alexan
der. .'All were obtained from''expo
sures of the trachyceras horizon of
the hosselkus limestone â¢. occurring a
few miles from Winthrop, Shasta
County, Cal.
Professor Merriam also discussed
the relationships of arctotherium, this
paper being devoted to theories re
garding the affinities and origin of the
group of bear-like species classed un
der the genus arctotherium. Â«
E. L. Furlong of the geology depart
ment of the State . University read a
paper on "A New Sheep-Like Form
From the Samuel Cave." He discussed
the ; features, .of a sheep-like form
found, in- the .cave recently, in addi
tion to .the three representatives of
the ovinae already discovered there.
The latest, find, declared the speaker,
differed. f materially from any type
known - in Arnerica. ; His - paper was
given up to a recital of these points
of difference. .'"â . â  , . '.v'
At the afternoon session of the so
ciety Adolph Knopf, a graduate stu
dent of. the university, described the
geology of the Mineral King belt, an
area situated near the crest of the
Sierra Nevada in Ti)lare County, Cal.
He explained that the rocks of the
region consist of a metamorphlc belt
of quartzites, limestones and clay
slates invaded by mesozoic granites
and rendered more or less schistose.-
They represent an isolated remnant. of
the batholithic roof formerly coexten
sive with the range and are regarded,
from the nature of their, hypsometric,
relations, as having sunk over a mile
into the 'rising magma. It is this vol
umetric displacement of the intrusive
granites that their preservation from
the severe denudation that the region
has undergone is ascribable.
"A Study of the Stratigraphy and
Structure of the Mount Diablo Range"
was the title of F. M. Armstrong's pa
per, which followed. It was said by
the speaker that the Mount Diablo
range defined by : Whitney, ex
tending along the western side of the
San Joaquin Valley, is typical of the
southern coast ranges. It contains a
core of pre-Cretaceous strata and old
eruptive rocks overlain on both flanks
by! Cretaceous and Tertiary strata.
Topographically and structurally it
contains a number of separate divi
sions.
Professor E. W. Hilgard, dean of
the college "of agriculture of the uni
versity, read the last paper during the
afternoon ; session. His , subject was
"Some Peculiarities of Rock Weather
ing and Soil Formation in the Arid
Region."- His paper presented the re
sults of observations on the differences
in; the. processes of weathering under
humid and arid conditions, respec
tively, and the physical and chemical
differences in the ! resulting regoliths.

BERKELEY, Dec. 30. â An inquest
has been ordered in the case of Mrs.
Judith ; Chase, an aged woman, resi
dent at 2109 West Fourth street, West
Berkeley, who was found dead in'bed
last night by; her son; Frank Chase.
Mrs. Chase had ; been ailing for some
time. Last night about midnight<she
called to her son Frank. As she was
in the habit of calling during the night
he did not at once go into' her room,
but instead* answered: ''Go to sleep,
mother; .everything is. all right" . '"â 
He heard nothing; further for some
time and becoming .uneasy he arose
and, lighting a lamp, went into 'his
mother's ; room to find her taking her
last v breath. .
Because there; was no physician in
attendance and because Mrs. Chase
had been heard to say that she feared
some one was trying to do away with
her/ Deputy -Coroner Streightif has
ordered that an inquest be held next
Tuesday. It is believed, however, that
death resulted from natural causes.

HOLIDAY WEEK
BRINGS QUIET
Reports Indicate That the
Year Has Made a Showing
Better Than Was Expected
OUTLOOK IS FAVORABLE
Belief Prevails That There
Will Be Still Further
Improvement During 1905
NEW YORK, Dec- 30.â Dun's -weekly
review of trade to-morrow will say:
Holiday week brought the customary
quiet conditions in the business world,
inventories and preparations for annual
settlements monopolizing attention ex
cept in some branches of manufacture
where immediate deliveries were re
quired. Severe snowstorms also inter
rupted communication and transporta
tion, particularly at the West, but on
the whole the elements were helpful,
as the drought was broken in the Pitts
burg region. Annual reviews indicate
that the year has made a much better
showing than seemed possible at the
outset, the second half comparing very
favorably with the first six months,
and the amount of business on the
books in the leading industries prom
ises still further improvement In 1905.
Traffic returns of indicate
that the gross earnings of the railways
were 7.2 per cent larger than in the
previous year, and foreign commerce
for the last- week at this port shows
an increase of $1,543,163 in exports and
a very large gain of $3,819,245 in imports
as compared with 1S03.
BUOYANT SENTIMENTS.,
Buoyant sentiments prevail in the
iron and steel Industry.
Supplies of native hides are accumu
lating owing to the liberal movement
of cattle, and the tone is easy, but
small stocks of branded hides maintain
that department.
Woolen goods are advancing because
of the upward tendency of raw wool,
and purchasers are more willing to
place contracts at prevailing rates.
Failures this week number 252 in the
United ! States, against 232 last year,
and 11 in Canada, compared with 17 a
year ago.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say: Dis
tributive trade generally is marking
I time, while oast results and future
! prospects are subjects of consideration.
j'A period of marked, even unexpected,
! activity in holiday goods of higher than
usual quality has brought to a close a
year which, because of marked im
provement in the . last quarter, has
ended better than It began, and certain
ly in far better shape than seemed pos
sible at the turn of the year, whole
sale trade is naturally of the lightest
at this season of stock taking and in
ventory, and stormy . weather and the
i flurry in raw cotton have" been addi-
I tional chilling influences. Rather less
! than the usual annual clearing sales
i have occurred because of the' notable
| absence of stocks of finished goods
pressing for sale. Collections show
' some effect from the recent heavy cir
i culation of money In all lines In en
i larged receipts.
Industry is of notably large volume
' for this season of the year, especially in
j iron and steel and kindred lines of
i manufacture.
PRICES OF METALS HARDEN.
Railway returns are favorable in that
increased earnings are quite general,
and the only drawback is the country
wide reports of car shortage.
At the West an important feature has
been the breaking up of the winter
wheat drought.
Prices of metals have hardened this
week, copper on good demand advanc
ing to. the highest point yet reached.
"Wool is strong, and stocks in dealers*
hands are the lightest in years. This
makes for strength In the finished prod
uct, business in which, however, is
light.
Business failures In the United States
for the week ending December 29 num
ber 218, against 249 last week, 209 in
the like week in 1903, 202 in 1902, 268 in
1901 and 229 in 1900. In Canada failures
for the week number 20 against 37 last
week and 18 this week a year ago. \'f/Â±l
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending December 29 aggregate
981,140 bushels against 1,080,703 last

SATURDAY .' . .DECEMBER 31. 1904
THE SENATORSHIP.
T OXG before the late election The Call said that sectional fair
j ness and natural politick required that the Senatorshjp. to be
*â ' filled by the coming Legislature be conceded to Southern
California. We said this before the Republican State convention
was held, and we then had, and now have, no choice between the
candidates put forward by that part of the State. Nor did we then
take this position nor do we now maintain it in a spirit unfriendly to
any aspirant from any other part of the State. . To aspire to the Sena
torship is an- honorable man's honorable ambition, and as far as we
tioiv.no other kind of man is aspiring.
The Republican party has an overwhelming majority in the
Legislature. It is big enough to do wrong or to do right at its own
â¢>!easure. It has the present welfare of the whole State in its hands,
and it holds this commission by a popular majority so large as to
increase the solemnity of its responsibility. Fortunately much of the
past in' the politics of the State is ended, closed and rolled up like
a scroll. Where. the most of us have fought corporations as they
seemed to deserve there is now a better understanding between them
and the people. For the last two years we have witnessed the satis
factory meeting of producers and transportation corporations face
to face, to discuss the needs of one and the claims of the other.
Neither has always got what it wanted, but both have got what they
needed, a better understanding. Each has learned something of the
other's point of view, and that always leads to a better understandiqg.
So, While there is a more peaceful spirit abroad and a tendency to
mutual concession, the old issues are less apparent in politics. At
the same time there is no abatement in watchfulness, but it is
charged with a greater wisdom and knowledge of the way to protect
any interest that may be in danger.
With this friction taken out of the political situation the Legis
lature will meet under circumstances that enable a calm and just
consideration of all rights'and the choice of right remedies wherever
they are needed. The choice of a Senator of the United States from i
California in this situation is possible along the lines of natural ]
politics, and we are still persuaded that natural politics concedes the j
Senator to Southern California. Officially, Northern California is I
full jeweled in ever}' hole. We have the Governor and Lieutenant j
Governor, one Senator, a Cabinet officer, the great Federal offices !
and a majority of the Supreme Court Justices. What more do we j
want, and what more should we have?
We know it is said that in certain Eastern States locality is not
considered, and in some cases both Senators are from the same town.
The answer to this is that no Eastern State has the geography of
California. This State is nearly iooo miles long. It differs from all
the other States in having a dense, vigorous and enterprising popu
lation in its southern end, between which and the rest of the State
deserts gleam and mountains loom. In that south are all the essen
tials of community life. After the idiy?-?T n g and isolating deserts and
mountains are passed the population, Â«'t fkrst sparse, increases to the
vigorous, effective dynamic centers of the north.
No other State is so bisected. No other State has two such
separated expressions of American enterprise and strength. No
other State has two such populations without continuity and con
tact. Other States are homogeneous. Their populations are in un
broken contact. Their interests are interlaced and confluent. Not
so here. Yet the great growth of Southern California is the pride of
the north, and the growth and resources of the north are the pride
Â«if the south. Politically they are one. In a partisan sense the only
rivalry between them is in the percentage of their Republican ma
jority' to the total vote cast. Each did its share in polling a majority
of nearly six score thousands for the national ticket. The enlight
ened Democracy north and south joined the Republican procession
and helped. All who had part in it expect some good for Cali
fornia to come out of it. One way to get it is by being fair to
Southern California. Give that section the Senator. Let the north
ern aspirants, deserving men all, give notice of their ambition. Let
their friends put them in focus, but as good party men let them each
remember the geography, political, commercial and physical, of their
preat State and leave no heart burnings in the south to work party
<lefeat later on, and perhaps at some party crisis that may mean
much for good government.
The legislators are now taking their holiday recreation and will
soon gird themselves for work. We invite their most earnest atten
tion to the considerations here presented. We are inflexible in our
belief that what we suggest is, the best for the State, for the people
and therefore for the party.
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
TO-MORROW will appear in the Sunday Call Magazine the first
installment of one of the most notable novels of the season by
a world-famous writer, "The Brethren," a romance of the Cru
sades, by H. Rider Haggard. Mr. Haggard needs no introduction j
to readers. As a master of weird, imaginative, if at times sensational
romance, he is unquestionably without a peer. In "The Brethren,"
however, he has departed widely from his earlier methods and has
ventured into the field of the legitimate historical romanticist- With
out sacrificing any of the qualities of treatment and style which
made the peculia/charm of "She," "Allan Quartermain" and "King
Solomon's Mines,*' "The Brethren" has stamped itself as a highly
successful historical novel and has been received with favor through
out the East. "The Brethren" will appear complete in five install
ments. It will be followed by "The Castaway," by Hallie Erminie
Rives, and Booth Tarkington's polished little romance, "Monsieur
Beaucaire/'
"Driftwood," by Martha Tustin Patton, is the prize story Jn
the fiction contest for the week. This is the second prize won by
this writer. It is a touching little San Francisco New Year's story.
There are two features pertinent to the New Year: "The Blowing
of the Horns," an historical account of the origin of a now popular
and "California's 1904 Record in Athletics," written by Louis
Levy. The article contains a brief summary of some of the notable
achievements of the past year by California athletes in various lines
of sports, dealing especially with football, swimming, tennis, box
ing, racing, polo, field sports and baseball.
The Chimmie Fadden articles, which suffered an unavoidable in
terruption for a week, will be continued with an epic in slang on
"The Wisdom of Women and the Unwisdom of Philosophers," with
ample action in the narrative. Charles Dryden continues the ad
ventures of his wandering youth in "On and Off the Bread Wagon,"
carrying his hero through a harrowing experience with a Texas
track-repairing gang. "The Jottings of Old Lim Jucklin," by Opie
Read, are continued with a discourse on gambling, and there is the
usual book review page by Robert W. Ritchie, in addition to the
Puzzle Page for the children.

0M THE LAST DAY OF
THE YEAR.
BY BEATRICE NELSON.
Â£. C I M very BOrry > Dut there's not a
I chair left in the parlor car." The
j Pullman conductor looked really
distressed. Somehow the Gib
sonesque figure of Stella Mayhew
seemed utterly incongruous with a day
coach for a background. It was the
aftermath of the Christmas rush, with
family parties and numerous single
tourists returning from a week's pleas
uring in the big city. That was all the
reason why he hated to see Miss May
hew doomed to the day coach. It would
be crowded to suffocation.
"I'll see what I can do," he said cour
teously as he turned to assist her into
the coach behind the parlor car. "Per
haps some one may fail to turn up and
a reservation may be forfeited."
"Thank you," said 'the girl gracious
ly, and, followed by the porter and her
suit case, she disappeared into the day
coach.
It was as the conductor had feared,
crowded. She passed down the aisle
and had about decided that she would
have to go in a car behind when the
sound of her own name, spoken in a
surprised voice, brought her to a stand
still.
"Jack Moreland," she cried In won
der, and' held out both hands impul
sively, utterly unmindful of the inter
ested passengers and the grinning por
ter. Moreland took both her hands,
then suddenly remembered" and dropped
them without speaking. Flinging his
bag from the seat next the window he
made room for her. She, too, had re
covered from the shock â and the pleas
ure â o f this unexpected meeting,
though her cheeks were flushed a trifle.
"Perhaps you were saving that seat
for some one?"
"No, I think my good angel must
Just have warned me of your coming."
He settled her luggage and dropped
into the seat beside her.
"This is great luck." he remarked,
"and to think that I have been dread
ing this trip!" ,."-;
"You don't deserve meeting me. Here
I have been back a fortnight and you
haven't been near the house." She did
not add even mentally that she had
missed the flowers which had come
from him daily before her trip abroad.
"I have been very busy," he said
gravely, at which she smiled quizzi
cally.
"Planning a barn dance for the
Pennlfield-Browns, or steering some
pretty Western woman through the
shoals of New York society?"
"Neither," he said shortly. "That
is not mv line just now."
"Oh!" she looked out of the win
dow. He had changed and yet he had
seemed very glad to see her. "Did
you make the mistake of failing to
have a seat reserved in the parlor car,
I too?"
) "No, I have taken to riding in day
I coaches lately."
She glanced at him quizzically.
"Don't tell me, Jack, that you're
going in for literature and are study
ing types?"
Then she hadn't heard. Why should
he tell her now, with a thirty-mile
run through Paradise before him?
"Types are interesting, don't you
think so? Rather different, these
people, from the sort you'll see at the
Brandons .to-night. I , suppose you
are going out to spend the week end
with them?"
"Yes, and you. too?"
"No, I'm bound for Poughkeepsie."
He bent over suddenly to pick up a
violet which had fallen from the great
bunch at her belt. "These must seem
mighty poor imitation, after seeing
the real thing in Italy," he said as he
etraightened up.
Stella looked from him to the flying
landscape.
Poughkeepsie! And he was so anx
ious to change the subject. She had
heard rumors of his Interest in Dick
Farrar's young sister. Perhaps she
was in Vassar College. No, not now
â during the holidays.
Jack went on talking quietly about
her trip, asking her questions which
she answered half mechanically. A
little country school teacher, seated
across the aisle, watched them curi
ously. They made her think of a
frontispiece in a novel illustrated by
Christy. ,
Suddenly he glanced at his watch.
"By Jove, how time has flown. We'll
pull into your station In five minutes."
Stella Mayhew watched him gather
up her luggage as one in a dream. For
her the time had draggedâ and it was
his fault. He had changed, while sheâ
"When we come back to town I hope
you'll findâ timeâ to call." She put an
odd little emphasis on the word "time."
'(Thanks awfully, but I'm not going
about much and â "
He saw the look, half-wondering,
half- hurt, which crept Into her eyes,
and he turned to her abruptly. His
face had gone a bit white and his voice
had lost Its even quality.
"I thought you knew. No, I lacked
the courage to tell you," he said calm
ly. "I took a business cropper â and I'm
going to Poughkeepsie to sell derricks
PAPER NOSES
The making of artificial noses has
reached a high state of perfection. Of
course, one would hardly go to the
length of having the nose amputated
sc that this fact might be proved. But
should that member be lost by accident
or disease a very good substitute can
be purchased. The best are
said to be made of wax, and the best
can be. bought for about $185; though
a really good one can be had for $75.
A nose made of papier mache can be
bought for $5- They are enameled, and
have a very lifelike appearance. Waxen
and paper noses are, in case of dis
eases, perf erable to i those made by
the planting of flesh on : the diseased
parts. Several cases have been known
where the transplanting of flesh on the
nose has endangered men's lives.
The anchor gets its grip by a fluke.
CRIMES, NEW AND OLD.
Some of the offenses most severely
punished In old times have ceased to
be grounds. of prosecution; for exam
ple, heresy, witchcraft, religibuo non
conformity. On the other hand, mis
deeds which formerly were disregarded
have been made. punishable. It was not
until 1833 that the . English law began
to treat drunkenness as a crime, rather
than a misfortune. ..In 1857 a' fraud on
the Dart of a trustee â¢ and . in , 1875 the

Pullmans."
She was staring at him with wide
eyes.
"Jack â I â I don't jinderstandâ oh,
why didn't you tell me this before?"
"Because I was a blooming coward."
The train was slowing up. "And now
you'll see why I'm not playing the so
cial game very strong this season." He
was standing In the aisle, suit case in
hand. "Remember me to the Bran
dons â awfully nice couple."
She nodded her. head, and followed
his straight, square-shouldered figure
from the car. The Brandon footman
was waiting for her.
"Jack." she said suddenly. He had
swung back on the train. She caught
her breath sharply as he lifted his hat
and nodded to her cheerily. Then she
turned toward the depot and the wait
ing carriage.
"And I never even said I was sorry."
That night she cornered her host in
the library.
"Mr. Brandon, what does it mean
when you come to a cropper in busi
ness?"
"That depends on the man, girlie.
Who has been coming croppers?"
"Jack Moreland."
"Moreland. eh?" said Mr. Brandon,
flicking the ashes lightly from the
cigar. "Well, the young cub was a
fool. After his father had been dead
four years â four years, mind you â it
was found that he had â er â hypothe
cated certain funds' belonging to
estates for which he was trustee.
Beautiful piece of work, the old man
did â took four years to unearth it,
and even then the thing could have
been fought out in court and his heirs
would have won on a technicality. But
young Moreland lost his head and
threw his whole share in the estate to
cover what he chose to call his father's
dishonor. Nearly drove his mother
crazy. The old lady has plenty to
live on and has gone to London, where
she will not be forced to realize too
keenly the fact her son is sellingâ erâ
derricks."
â¢'She was very cruel â and he her
only boy." said Stella musingly.
"And he was a fool.' according to
up-to-date business methods. Better
come into the billiard room. They're
playing pool."
"No, thanksâ Iâ I want to run up to
my room for a few moments."
And when she came back she car
ried a letter which she asked a ser
vant to take to the village for the
early morning mail. It was addressed
to Mr. John C. Moreland, care Gra
ham Contracting Company,
Duane street, New York City, and It
ran: . ' . .
"Dear old Jack â Forgive me, I
didn't understand. I thought you
were not glad to see me back. You
might have known it wouldn't have
made any difference â not a bit. do you
understand? You haven't played fair
with me â but I'm coming back to
town on Monday, and If you come up
Monday .night â very early â perhaps
I'll forg-ive you. Oh, Jack, Jack, why
couldn't you trust me? And it's going
to be a happy, happy New Year for
us both. As always, .STELLA."
Absurdly disconnected, with words
lined once and twice, and riot at all
the note a slrl from a Christy illus
tration would be expected to write,
but she knew he would understand â and
he did.

$2,000,000 PER ANNUM.
Governor OffiGiallij Gets Figures
States Mining Development
Is oteaatly Advancing.
While there have been no phenomenal
strikes of gold in California recently,
every observer must see in the plans for
iievelbpinent, especially in the gold
oredging industry, that confidence is
fctrong among those who have the best
opportunities for judging the mineral
wealth of this State. A significant
statement is found in tha official re
l>ort tha.t the trustees of the State Min
ing Bureau have Just submitted for the
c Lfnsideration of the Governor and Leg
islature of California. This is, in sub
ttanee. that eince 1E33 the increase in
t ho vaiue of the mineral products of
California has been about $2,000,000 a
year. ThÂ© total mineral output of
California in the past seventeen years,
including li*03 and not including 1904â
icncerning which last there are no
â statistics available at this time â has
been J41S.S51.S63. of which $247,371,953
has been in gold. There are fifty-one
mineral substances that are no-w pro
duced in Calif ornia.
In part the Mining Bureau trustees
say. in a summary, that "this brief
statement shows how prosperous is the
present condition of the mining indus
try of California, which, instead of be
ing in decadence, has a steady and
large increase in value of output and
this increase, which has extended over
a period of years, still continues."
Sc/rne mention of recent works to de
velop the mining values In California
are mentioned herewith,
TR1NITV COUNTY SCHEME.
Work has been started on the large
mining project in Trinity County, of
which mention has already been made
in The Call, to turn the Trinity River
from its course and to lay bare a mile
and a half of the riverbed. This will
be accomplished by means of a tunnel
tu pierce a mountain. A big bend in
the river will be cut off. Drillers will
be used to prospect the riverbed, which
is eupposed to be rich in placer gold.
Along the old canal where the tail
ings of the Cherokee mine were
dumped, near Pentz, in Butte County,
a search will be made for a gravel
body, which is reported to be rich. Bed
rock is reported to be about fifty feet
below the surface and the gravel may
be 'twenty feet deep. Some prospecting
has recently been accomplished with
drills.. This method has been discarded
i'Â»r the present and a shaft wili be
sunk.
A new process is being used, experi
mentally, to save the fine gold from the
Grizzly Hill mine in Amador County.
According to the Jackson Ledger gravel
is plentiful, but the farther into the
hill ttÂ»e tunnel is pushed the lighter
and finer the gold becomes. " ----â â 
The Folsom Telegraph reports the
â¢ obstruction of a gold dredger, to be
â¢â ptrated on the Ingleslde fruit, farm,
near Fair Oaks bridge. There are 500
a i-res in the farm and adjoining prop
erty that have recently been prospected
with results that are satisfactory. The
land is under bond to the El Dorado
Gold Dredging Company.
The bond on the Omega Table Moun
tain gravel mine has been transferred,
so reports the Sonora Union-Democrat,
.to the American Industries Company.
The price quoted is $50,000.
Of operations in the mines of Amador
County the Arnador Record says in
The addiUtocal forty stamps of the Kfn
h"dy mill axe now running full blast, mainly
100 in all.
The onoadaga minÂ«, belonging to R. W.

the first payment on the bond. It is the pur
. -Â« of the associates cf Mr. Conilt to begin
development work on the mine bjr January 1,
R necessary arrangement* can be made prior
to that lime. The -Onondaga mlnÂ« Is about
'â >ur miles from Plymouth.
It is expected that the forty-stamp taill of
tha Argonaut mine will be running within two
"eeka, after being rhut down for several
years. When the litigation between that com
laey and the Kennedy ended underground
work was resumed and development carried
on eo that there will new be more advantages
[or keeping the mill supplied than heretofore.
About 2000 tecs of ore are already stored la
readine** for crushing.
'-'â  zi at the Burlington mine haa been tem
.T""rarl!y discontinued. The shaft Is now down
183 feet.
The Grass Valley Tidings says that
dredging â¢will soon be started along the
Trinity River, above Junction City, on
& group of mines, including the Sheri
dan, the Given, the Post place and the
Fturdlvant ranch, If the results ef
prospecting are encouraging.

an easy one to solve. One spring In particu

hot enough for a hot bath.
The flrÂ« discovery of gold was made last
August by Frank Harris and Ev L. Cross, and
was christened the Bullfrog mine, and later,
wjien other parties came in to prospect, a dis
trict was organized and called the Bullfrog
i.!s.triet. Since then numerous other dlscover

The ledges here ar* very large and some of
them are paying milling ore for a distance of
ten to fifty feet wide, with occasional streaks
and bunches in them that will run Into the

little Iron is on* ot the peculiarities of the
ore. While the gold Is not all free, from ap
pearances and some tests that have been made
It can be treated very satisfactorily with a
freÂ« milling and cyanlding plant.
Altogether mining men of experience agree
that Bullfror haa some of the best surface
fhowir.is that Nevada has ever had for big
and rich mines, but under the conditions h
ietlnz tt will be several months before actual
development work will commence.
In the investigation that Is promised
by the Government concerning the
cornering of the petroleum producing
industry of California by the simple
device of making- the market price of
oil at the wells low, the petroleum*
miners of the State will be largely in
terested. San Francisco is the larg
est market for the crude petroleum of
any single California city. The de
mands of the railway companies for
fuel oil are very large, but both the
Southern Pacific Company and the
Santa Fe have their own sources of
supply. The Southern Pacific is the
owner of stock In the Associated Oil
Company. The Santa. Fe has lands
that It acquired at an advanced price
paid to its own employes a few years
ago. There are several parties that
profit by keeping down the ' price of
crude California petroleum at the
wells, but these are not the petroleum
miners. The Standard Oil Company
buys oil. The railways seek to get In
hand all the oil lands that they can
at bedrock prices and so insure cheap
fuel for their own use for a long
series of years.
The railway rates for moving petro
leum from the Kern River and other
California producing points to this city
are so much greater than the cost of
piping for the Standard Oil Company
io tidewater -that it is -varyâ difficult,
if not impossible, for . any ordinary
combination of producers to compete
for contracts continuously with the
Standard Oil corporation. The situa
tion is artificial all along the. -line in
that there is'a standard product to
market, entirely in the State of Cali
fornia, finding its largest demand in
California, but all the conditions are
so contrived against the owner of oil
wells that he has not anything like a
chance to make money that owners of
any other sort of California mineral
deposits enjoy. Great interest will
attach to the investigation of the
"methods adopted by large corpora
tions in this State.

WIFE ACCUSES
VAUDEVILLIAN
Nine Weeks of Married Life
With an Actor Is Enough
to Disillusion This Bride
HAVE STRENUOUS TIMES
Martha Braham Alleges That
Her Husband Threatened
to Carve Her With a Razor
Martha Braham says anguish was
her portion during her honeymoon, and
instead of kisses there were threats to
kill from her husband, Louis Braham,
who is a member of the Great Western
Vaudeville Troupe, now touring the
State. Her complaint for divorce, filed
j'esterday, is a veritable diary of a
deluded woman. She married the actor
on September 1; on September 11 he
threatened to take his own life, and on
the 13th he told his friends that her
conduct would drive him to suicide.
On the 15th he packed his things and
went to the Golden Gate House, on
Eddy street, and told her â  she would
have to live with him there, which she
declined to do, believing, the place to
be of Questionable character. On the
27th he varied the programme, she
says, by threatening to kill her and
rushed at her with a drawn razor, and
said he would make her beg on the
street and die in the gutter. Three
times after that he packed up and
threatened to leave, but did not, so on
November 7 she deserted him. Since
then, she says, he followed her on the
street and threatened her life and she
had to call the police for assistance.
Mrs. Braham declares that she is ab
solutely penniless, while her husband
is earning $60 a week. The vaudeville
show is owned by Miles Brothers of 116
Turk street, and she asks that they be
enjoined from paying his salary.
Christ Runge, the Tonopah mining
man who Bued his young wife, Nettie,
for divorce on the ground of cruelty,
has withdrawn his complaint and she
has withdrawn her cross-complaint in
which she made counter accusations of
mistreatment. Incidentally, the in
junction tying up his property and
funds has been dissolved.
A bench warrant was issued yester
day by Judge Kerrigan for Dr. Ed
ward L. Grossman, who was in arrears
in the payment of $20 a month alimony
to his wife, Laura M. Grossman. When
he was brought into court Grossman
made an explanation and the contempt
proceedings were dismissed with in
structions for him to keep up the pay
ments.
Suits for divorce were filed by J.
Winifred Butler against Clyde H. But
ler, to whom ahe was married in Sep
tember, 1903, and who deserted her on
Christmas day of the same year;
Louis Scheile against Ella Scheile,
cruelty; Theresa A. Herger against
Ernest Herger, cruelty.

SEEKS IN VAIN
FOR FREEDOM
Application for Writ for
Release of Chan Cheung
on Bonds Is Not Granted
PRISONER IS REMANDED
Attempt Made to Show That
Indictment for Murder Was
Only a Subterfuge Fails
The application for a writ of habeas
corpus for . the release of Chan
Cheung, Indicted by the.Grand Jury for
the murder of Tom Yick of the Chinese
Educational Society, was argued before
Judge Lawlor yesterday. The question
at issue was the release of the defend
ant on bonds. The Judge denied the
writ and remanded the prisoner into
the custody of the Sheriff.
When tha was called Attorney
Bell said he proposed to show that the
evidence before the Grand Jury was not
sufficient to find an indictment and
that the petitioner was not indicted
because he was guilty at murder, but
because he had refused to testify on
certain points under investigation by a
committee of the. Grand Jury. If be
could show that the presumption of
guilt against the petitioner was not
great he was entitled to ball.
Chan Cheung was sworn and testified
that he had been taken from his home
on Monday night. He had never ap
peared before the Grand Jury nor had
he" given any testimony before that
body.
T. B. Andrews, foreman of the Grand
Jury, testified that some witnesses had
testified before the Grand Jury through
an Interpreter and some without an
Interpreter. He could not recollect the
name of the interpreter. Chan Cheung
had not been called. The testimony
had Dot been taken in shorthand. A
question as to whether the witness had
told a reporter that the Indictment had
not been found against Chan Cheung
for the murder of Tom Yick, but for
other reasons, was objected to and the
objection sustained.
Bell then submitted the indictment
found in May, 1903, against the presi
dents of the Chinese tongs accused of
conspiring to murder Tom Yick, and
Chan Cheung's name was not among
them. He also filed the evidence taken
at the trial of Nguen Lain, one of the
conspirators, showing that Chan
Cheung'B name had not been mentioned
by the witnesses.
District Attorney Bylngton Bald he
would take the position that the peti
tioner was not entitled to bail. The
filing of the indictment created, he said,
a presumption of guilt.
The Judge agreed with the District
Attorney and said that the evidence at
the Nguen Lun trial clearly showed that
Tom Yick was assassinated. Bell said
that all of the conspirators with the
exception of Nguen Lun were out on
$16,000 bonds an*; he failed to see, why
an exception should be made in regard
to Chan Cheung. The Judge replied
that tHey had been admitted to bail by
consent of the District Attorney. He
would discharge the writ and remand
the prisoner. : : ' ;:'
Bell says that if he should fail to get
the consent of the District Attorney to
Chan Cheung being released on bonds
he will make another application for a
writ before another Judge.
CRAP GAME RBSUI/TS
IN CUTTING SCRAPE
Henry Chrittenden Stabbed Four Times
by Edward Parker In Room on
East Streets
Five negroes indulged in a game of
craps as they came over on the boat
from Sausalito last evening. Every
thing went well until there was a dis
pute about the winnings and after the
boat landed the party repaired to the
rcom of Henry Chrittenden, who was
in the game, to settle the argument.
The room Is at 11 East street and as
scon as the door was locked shaking
dice was resumed and the result was
a dispute. Chrittenden withdrew from
the game and started to disrobe, say
ing he was going to bed. It was then
that Edward Parker, another member
of the quintet, insisted that the man
continue shaking. , Chrittenden re
fused and after a few words Parker
drew a knife, with which he attacked
the owner of the room. Parker struck
Chrittenden four times in the back,
Inflicting painful but not dangerous
wounds.
When the trouble had ceased and
Parker had been overpowered by the
other members of the party, Chritten
den went to the Harbor police station
and Detectives McGowan and Conlan
were placed on the case. McGowan
and Conlan searched the room and
after a brief Investigation learned that
Parker had gone to Oakland. They
took the next boat and arrested him in
a house at 2262 Magnolia street They
brought him back to this city and
charged him with assault to commit
murder. Chrittenden was treated at
the Harbor Hospital.

HOODLUM ACTS
TO BE STOPPED
Chief Wittman Issues His
Orders for the Conduct
of Crowds New Year's Eve
ARRESTS TO BE MADE
Striking People With Tree
Boughs and Daubing Faces
With Paint Reprobated
Confetti throwers and young men
generally who blow horns and do oth
er "stunts" on the coming in of the
New Year should take warning from
Chief Wittman's orders to his com
mand. If the weather continues wat
ery there will be no reason for any at
tention being paid to the Chief's or
ders, but if a change should come
young men would better beware. The
Chief's orders are as follows:
With the expiration of the year 1004 and the
advent of the year 1909 It is expected that a
vast number of our good citizens will continue
the practice, which of late years has become
the custom in San Francisco, of promenading
Kearny, Market and other intersecting streets
on New-year's eve, seeing the old year out
and the new year in.
For the past three years the Police Depart
ment has handled these vast crowds, which
congregaU as above stated. In a very efficient
and satisfactory manner, but it has been our
experience that previous to three years ago
rowdies took advantage of the occasion to
lnsujt ladles and annoy the promenaders with
acts of hoodlumlsm and I wish the strongest
measures taken by the Police Department to
the end that this does not occur this year and
that the eood record made by the department
in the past two years in this regard may be
continued. The following extra details are
therefore hereby ordered and I wish you to
give strict orders to the officers so detailed to
be prompt and active In seeing to it that the
people are protected in their desire to enjoy
the evening peacefully.
Two officers wlU be detailed from Company
B to each block on the north side of Market
street from Kearay to Taylor and thsee offi
cers to each block on the south side of Market
street from Third to Sixth streets.
Sergeant. Coogan and five patrolmen from
Company A. to be relieved by Sergeant
Brophy and five patrolmen from the same
company, to be detailed at Powell and Market
streets.
Sergeant Mullender and five patrolmen from
Company E, to be relieved by Sergeant Grif
fin and five patrolmen from the same com
pany, to be detailed at Grant avenue and
Market street.
Corporal Ferguson and . five patrolmen from
Company F, to be relieved by Corporal McGee
and five patrolmen from the same company,
to bo detailed at Stockton and Market
streets.
Sergeant Blank and five patrolmen from
Company D. to be detailed at Kearny and
Market streets, and to be relieved by Corporal
Shanahan and five patrolmen from the same
company.
Captain Bplllane will take personal charge
and exercise personal supervision over all tbe
details on Market street.
Captain Duke will take personal charge and
excrcisÂ« personal supervision over all the de
tails north of Market street. The latter will
.deploy men from the details at Kearny and
Market streets along the line of Kearny
street as may bo needed and from the detail
at Grant avenue and Market street along
Grant avenu* as may be necessary, and wlU
detail two officers in the block on Mason
street between Eddy and Kills, to 'â  be relieved
by two others at 11 o'clock p. m.
All these details to be in effect at 7 :30 p. m.
of the 81st inst.. and continue until 1:80 a. m.
of January 1, 1905, when the officers as above
detailed will go to their regular beats.
Do not allow crowds to gather at any par
ticular point, but keep the people moving.
Complaints have been made In the past that
people have been struck by boughs of trees in
the hands of rowdies. Instruct the officers
detailed to take all such material away from
any one carrying the same on the street. Com
plaints have also been made of young men
carrying pots of > paint or like material with
which they - daub the faces â  of passers by.
HAVE THIS STOPPED and take the material
away from them. ARREST AX.L. PERSONS
who do not behave themselves when warned
to do so and see that all peaceful persons have
the opportunity to enjoy themselves in a law
ful manner.
Have the officers on duty during the day of
the 81st inst. request all persons who have
evergreen decorations in front of their prem
ises to remove the same before nightfall, as by
this means you will remove some of the am
munition of the boodlum.
Captain Gleeaon will order the patrol wagon
from the O'Farrell Street Station to report at
the Central Station at 8 o'clock p. m. and re
main en duty there until 2 o'clock a. m., Jan
uary 1, 1905. '

BURLING AME MEN ON THE POLO FIELD IN MATCH GAMES
CLEVER PONIES
IN USE HERE
rPlafl Is Faster Than
Id Other Years.
ManB Visitors of
Note Mag Come
to Coast.
Down at the Burlingame Country
Club the poloists have been enjoying
seme exciting sport for weeks past, and
on every occasion a large gallery has
witnessed the work of the dashing
horsemen. The class of the ponies is
steadily increasing, so that the play is
as fast as can be seen on any field. The
ranks of the players have been in
creased by the addition of J. O. Tobin
and Cyril Tobin and by the reappear
ance in the saddle of Charley Dunphy.
The latter plays a wonderful game in
the number one position. The one re
gret of his friends last season was the
fact that illness prevented his playing
against Captain Haig, the famous Eng
lish expert. Dunphy's fprte is in riding
off an opponent, and If he tried these
tantalizing tactics on the herculean cap.
tain the latter's picturesque vocabulary
â¢would have been taxed to the utmost.
The home-coming of Francis J. Caro
lan, master of Crossways, is expected
to put renewed life into all the sports
of the field at Burlingame. During his
sojourn in the East he met many prom
inent poloistB, and he may bring word
that some of them, will come West to
test the skill of the Western horsemen.
The Burlingame men still hope to have
a representative English team visit
this coast.
That the California ponies are highly
appreciated is shown by the prices re
ceived for them. T. A. Driscoll sold a
pony recently for $2500. It will be used
In England. Walter McCreery is said
to have refused an offer of $5000 for a
California bred pony he took to Eng
land.
These prices indicate what an expen
sive pastime polo is. One player says
each game he has played for many
years has cost him more than $50. As
sometimes three games are played in
one week the aggregate expense is
large. The average number of ponies In
the string of a player Is eight, and
they never miss a meal.
The sportsmen who support the Cali
fornia Polo and Pony Racing Associa
tion seem in a fair way to develop the
Interesting sport of pony racing to a
high standard. The thoroughbred
breeding establishments are being ran
sacked for 111 -nourished thoroughbreds
which come under the standard of four
teen hands three Inches In height. Ten
new ponies will start at the' next meet
ing of the association.
PONT RACES POSTPONED
UNTIL MONDAY NEXT
With a Brief Spell of Dry Weather
the Track at San Mateo Will â¢ .
Be Available.
Owing to the inclement weather the
officials of the California Polo and
Pony Racing Association have post
poned the races scheduled for to-day
until Monday. If it is possible to run
on that day the second day's pro
gramme â¢will be run off one week from
toÂ»-day. The track at San Mateo, on
which the races are to be run. Is of a
sandy nature and dries rapidly.
Owing to the sodden condition of
the field it is doubtful if the polo game
scheduled for to-morrow. can be,play
ed, even if the weather clears up.
Witness Disappears.
The case of - Harvey Chinn, a col
ored man, charged with assault to
murder, came on for trial before a
jury in Judge Lawlor's court yester
day. The Judge was . informed that
Henry Conway, the complaining wit
ness, had disappeared. The Judge
expressed the opinion that Conway
had been Induced to keep away by the
defendant's friends. He issued a
bench warrant for Conway's arrest
and continued the case till January
t. Conway was stabbed by Chinn on
September 4.

Animated Scenes To-Night
The ducks on all the marshes within

last Sunday, as the alluring charm of
Christmas at home proved too strong
an attraction for the majority of
sportsmen. The boats and trains,
which are usuallv thronged with men
in shooting clothes, were nearly empty
last week-end.
conditions will be different this week.
Many men will leave the city to-day
for their shootlng_boxes to escape the
din with which it is customary to usher
in each new vear. Unless an unusual
amount of rain falls the shooting will
be excellent to-morrow, as birds are
found In large numbers and in every
direction.
The few men who went out last week
had excellent sport. Along the San
Pablo shore large bags of canvas
backs were secured. W. G. Hoffman
and Harry Trader shot near San Pablo
with good results.
Edgar Forster and Billy Schendel
were on the Petaluma marsh and had
a Joint bag of thirty-one birds. These
included cans, spoonies and teal.
Alex Martin secured a limit bag on a
preserve at Schellville on the Sonoma
marsh.'
Julius Bruns, M. J. Hynes, W. J.

No Games for Championship
of Association Football
League During Holidays
No matches will be played for the,
championship of the California Asso
ciation Football League either to-mor
row or on Monday. Though no matches
were arranged either for the Christmas
or the New Year holidays by the dele
gates who made up the championship
schedule, it was thought the opportun
ity might be seized to play off some of
the matches that have been postponed,
as, for example, the game between the
Occidentals and Oakland Hornets that
was set down for November 20; the
game between the Occidentals and the
Vampires and that between the Eagles
and the Oakland Hornets, both post
poned from November 27. Though the
suggestion was made by the secretary
of the league, the captains of the team3
are not willing 'to take the chance of
some .of their strong players' absence
during the holidays.
Some practice games between league
and other teams will,' however, be
played during the holidays. The Vam
pires will play a friendly match against
the Pickwicks on the ground at Web
ster street, Alameda, to-morrow. James
Frew will referee and the players will
occupy the following positions:

Rolfe and Petersen, goalkeeper and
fullback of the Vampires, are absent
from thÂ« team. Rolfe fractured hi3
wrist in playing with a punching ma
chine and Petersen was hurt in the
Vampire-Albion game. Rolfe will
not be able to play for a month and
it is feared Petersen may have to re
tire for* the rest of this season. Glar
ner will take Petersen's place in the
fullback line and Chivers will take
charge of the goal. The loss of Peter
sen will be a serious one for the Vam
pires, whose defense has been their
strong : point.
5 On Monday, January 2, the Oakland
Hornets will play a friendly match
against a team of British apprentices
gathered by the Rev. S. H. Wingfleld-
Dtgby; chaplain of the Seamen's Insti
tute of. San Francisco. The ball -will
be kicked off . at 2 : 3 0 p. m. '. at Idora
Park, Oakland. The make-up of the
sailors' " team cannot be ascertained
till the day of play, but the Hornets
will occupy ' the following positions:
Pomeroy, goalkeeper; Barrett and
Murphy, -fullbacks; H. Bird, W. Mc-
Gregor and McDiarmid, halfbacks;
R. Dlsher,-T. DIsher, McKenzie, Ryles
and Christiansen, forwards.
Henry Roberts, : honorary secretary
of the California Association Football
Union, has taken over' the duties of
secretary of the league as well.
No ; matches for the \ 1904-1905 cham
pionship of j the California Association
Football '.League having been played
since December 18, the table of results
remains unchanged. The order and
number of points gained by each team
are as follows: Albion Rovers 12, In
dependents 10, Occidentals 8, Oakland
Hornets 5, Vampires 5, Pickwicks 2,
Eagles 0.. Eighteen matches still remain
on the schedule of the league. The In

Hornets, Vampires,- Occidentals and

PLAYERS' RANK
TO BE DECIDED
Annual Class Singles Ten
nis Tournament Will De
cide the Eating of Men
As yet the inclement weather has
not interfered with play on the tennis
courts to any extent and an unusual
number of tournaments have been
held. Many old players have rejoined
the California Club and that organiza
tion has more active players than ever
before. Many of them do not play in
tournaments, but get out for a prac
tice game on Saturdays and Sundays.
At Golden Gate Park there are fully
as many players as ever, but they
have been given a rest from tourna
ment play for a few weeks. The" first
tournament of the new year will be
played on the park courts about Jan
uary 18. ;:â  >
For a year or so the ladles of the
park were without tournaments, but
the annex has been reorganized and
at least one tournament a month is
held. There are many new players In
the club and some of them will un
doubtedly become quite expert. Of
the younger girls, Miss Sarita Van
Vliet is probably the mgst promising.
She has not lost a tournament since
she joined the club, except a mixed
doubles event.
The most important event of the
winter season is the annual class sin
gles tournament, comes up for
argument on January 1. This tourn
ment will decide who Is the best man
in each class, a question that each
player is anxious to have settled-
Last year Drummond MacGavin
won the honors in the first class. Will
Allen in the second, A. E. Beyfuss in
the third and Bradley Wallace in the
fourth., MacGavin and Allen have
both left the State and Beyfuss has
gone up a class.
As usualmost interest centers in the
first class. Properly speaking there is
no first class at the club. Aside from
Dr. Hardy and Grant Smith, the only
man who has any claim to a first
class ranking is Dr. McChesney, but
he has played in no tournaments. He
is probably the best man in the club,
but is hardly a first class man. Men
like George Janes, Will Collier, Frank
Mitchell, Herbert Long, Dr. Hill, Carl
Gardner, Harry Rolf e, B. F. Nourse,
Ray Cornell and Chester Smith will
probably be put in the first class, but
most of them are not first class play
ers.
Collier has always figured In the
first class, but undoubtedly has gone
back or has not kept apace with the
game. Mitchell at times plays first
class tennis. Of the rest, Janes, Dr.
Hill and H. Long might not be out of
place In this class. Cornell, Smith,
Busch, Nourse and Rolfe would be
better placed in the: second class.
The second class will be much
smaller than in previous years. Here
tofore the first class has been small
and the second' large. A. Beyfuss,
Melville 'Long:, Dr. Younger, Albert
Kenyon, George : Cutter and Paul
Jones will probably be In this -class.
There \will be ' many â  players * In the
third and fourth classes, where the
competition will be exceptionally
keen. In the third class the most
promising candidates are C. G. Kuehh,
M. ' Warner, Spencer Grant and Dr.
Lovegrove.- W. ; Knowlton â  and Brad
ley Wallace look the strongest men In
the fourth" class.
The tournament will commence to
morrow and if possible will be fin
ished on Monday.. Entries close at
5:30 to-day, when the players. will be
classified and drawn.
Several changes have occurred .in
the continuous tournament during the
week. In the first class the only men
who have , moved are", the first five.
Ray â  Cornell, who - was No. 1, is now.
No. 3. â  He was' -beaten first by Janes
and then by Collier. The former is
'No.,1 and the latter No. 21 Dr. Bush
has*; lost "two matches by [default 'and
Is No. 4 . B. F. Nou rse is No. 5 .
r i There has! been : UttleTor : rio .'play in
the second class,. which is a small one.
>The T withdrawal ~ of ; Beyfuss, who
was No. â  1, â  puts; Gabriel : up; to No^ 2
and Long up to No. 3."

CLEVER HOUNDS
IN INAUGURAL
The Best Eight Coursers in
Training .to. Meet To-3Ior
row on Union Park Field
The coursing men will start the. new
year with two excellent stakes to-mor
row at Union Park. The eight dogs
in the Inaugural are closely drawn,
every course being practically a match
race. Where one dog figures to lead
his opponent *to the hare, the other's
cleverness more than offsets this ad
vantage. As a consequence the betting
promises to be unusually lively. The
Barge-Richard Anton course should be
the best of the day. In speed, clever
ness and stamina they figure equal.
Quita will be played on her cleverness
to beat McVey. Carlow Boy is sure to
take Belle Free to the hare, but Belle
is the cleverer worker and on the pres
ent strong hares should win. Hum
boldt will lead Lost Chord, but Tacks
the latter's experience.
The drawing for the special holiday
stake for Monday will be held to-mor
row at the park. The entry is limited
to forty-eight greyhounds. Special
trains will leave for the park on both
days at 10:15 a. m. and 1 p. m. The in
augural will not be run until the after
noon, following the second round in the
reserve event.
Among the new dogs in Sunday's
reserve stake is E. L. Grim's Hidden
Hatred (Don Pedro-Richmond), which
arrived recently from the East and is
said to be a good one. J. Hirodyen of
Los Angeles brought up Sir Dick
(Dick L-Duty) and Rialto (Repeat-
Lizzie M). Both are young dogs and
performed well down south. The
likely winners are:

MAYOR VETOES AMENDMENT
TO STABLE ORDINANCE
Says It Would Permit or Rebuilding
Structures Independently of Ob
jections of Property-Owners.
Mayor Schmltz yesterday trans
mitted to the Board of Supervisors his
veto of the amended ordinance pro
viding that any existing stable may
be reconstructed or replaced on Its
present site without the consent of the
adjacent property-owners. He says
that the amendment should more
properly be applied to the ordinance
regulating removal of buildings. The
veto message continues:
A lack of precision, with general uncertainty
of the termÂ« of the proposed amendment, prac
tically nullify and render Ineffectual the con
dition prescribed In section 143 In this respect,
that aald amendment falls to specify any lim
itations upon the capacity of public livery or
boarding stables affected by said section, re
quiring the written consent of the owners of
property within 200 feet of a stable designed
to accommodate more than six horses. The ab
sence of this condition In the amendment would
permit the rebuilding or replacing on Its pres
ent cite of any public livery or boarding sta
ble without regard to Its capacity and inde
pendent of the objections or wishes of th*
property owners in the immediate vicinity.

SAYS PRIESTS
ROB NATIVES
Ministers of the Eussian
Church Accused of Sharp
Practices by a Traveler
CHEMAWA, Or., Dec. 30. â That
the priests of the Russian church hold
the natives of the more remote Alas
kan regions in practical slavery Is the
story of Walter Story, an employe of
the Alaska Packing Company, who
has just come from Oreo, an out of
the way place on Prince William
Sound. The natives belong to the
Tetetluk tribe and few whites live in
the district.
, According to Story. . the priests of
the Russian church carry on a sys
tem of bleeding the natives out of
their money and furs, working all the
time upon the superstitious natures
of the aborigines until now they hold
them in abject terror.
Before a native can go on a hunt he
is told he must x secure the consent' of
the priest in charge of the mission, and
also must receive his blessing before
any success can result. ',:*";
. The consent and blessing cost money
or its equivalent. The priest, Story
says, gives them only when the native
agrees to deliver to the church 40 per
cent of the results of the hunt. For this
he receives the blessing while on the
hunt and upon his return.

BERGER PROVES
A POOR FIGHTER
Is Practically Defeated
; by Casey, a Boxer With
â  ;- No Pretension to Class
FMMaANIBEATS KEHOE
Bantam- Weight Shows More
and Hitting
Powers I Than Opponent
Big Jim Jeffries, the champion fight
er of the j world, can rest easily on his
laurels for a time, as one' of the sup
posed obstacles In his path has been
removed. The much touted Sam Ber
ger blew up with a resounding crash
in Mechanics' Pavilion last night when
he met Jim Casey, a boxer with no
pretensions whatever to class, In : a
four-round bout.
The two judges. Bob MacArthur of
the Olympic Club and Jimmy Lawler,
disagreed at the end of the four-round
bout and Referee Billy Roche, declined
to cast his vote in favor of either^man,
although, draws are not recognized In
amateur boxing. A draw was'^the "de
cision of the officials. The spectators
plainly showed what they thought the
decision should have been," standing
about the- ring- and- -cheering -Casey
while they had only Jeers for'Berger. "
The affair was a sorry exhibition of
glove work from start to finish^'.Ber
ger'a. blows lacked either direction or
force, while " Casey swung his, arms
around after the fashion of an old
Dutch -windmill. To the surprise of the
spectators, Casey was the -aggressor
from the start. He went after. Berger
at the tap of the gong and early In the
round staggered him with one of his
wild left swings that landed on- Ber
ger's head. Berger's seconds tried to
get him tojuse his left, but he seemed
to have no control over his blows.
HEAVY-WEIGHTS ARE '.SLOW.
Both men were slow on their feet and
devoted much of their time to wrest
ling about the ring. Berger's nose (.om
menced to bleed in the first round, and
throughout the fight he presented any
thing but a prepossessing appearance.
Casey was after him again in the sec
ond round and had the best ot a'slug
ging match. Berger'sent a left to the
he*ad,' but Casey came back with two
hard rights to the body. Berger was
holding continually to avoid punish
ment. Berger missed one chance for a*
right cross that was so palpable to the
spectators that they Jeered him for his
lack of ability to take advantage of
the opening. Near the â  end of â  the
round. Casey walked, Into a hard, right
to the head, -but it did not seem to
hurt him. ' -
Casey had all the best of the third
round, Berger contenting himself with
hanging on and wrestling, while the
crowd hooted him for his unfair tac
tics. When they came up for the fourth
and last round Berger offered to shake
hands, but Casey was too much in the
fighting mood for any such civility.
He struck Berger as he approached
him and then went after him at his
top speed. Casey missed a desperate
right swing to the head, but later on
made connections with a hard right
to the body. Berger continued his hold
ing tactics, while Casey used all the
limited knowledge of fighting he pos
sesses, to try to land an effective blow.
The men did not hear the gong which
signaled the end "of the bout; but kept
on fighting for several seconds.
BERGER SHOWS NO CLASS.
If Berger is wise he will not hook up
with KidsMcCoy or any other'profes
sional, as his showing last night does
not fill out the predictions of his
friends. v'iTi
Young Corbett and Jimmy Bntt
were introduced and each was given a
'cordial reception.
George FInnegan defeated Eddie Ke
hoe on points after four round's full of
clean hitting. Finnegan showed more
experience than his young opponent
and also proved a harder hitter. Kehoe
was knocked down in the fourth round
with a snappy left to the head. T He
was up in an instant and at it again.
For the greater part of the fight each
man seemed intent on landing a knock
out blow. The fight was by far the
best of the night.
The. gallery was crowded almost to its
capacity, the rows of spectators reach
ing down to the Polk-street end of the
Pavilion. The main floor was also well
filled, indicating that amateurism" has
Its golden rewards as well as the pro
fessional branch of the sport.
Harry Baker and Ralph Bullet, a
pair of sprightly bantams, were the
first to perform. Baker jabbed Bullet
on the nose until he was painted a rich
carmine down, to | his "waist line. Tlie
decision went to Baker on points.
Danny Cole might be a success as a
day laborer, but nature never Intended
him for a fighter. He lasted two rounds
with Alex McDonald and showed a bad
case of stage fright." After he had beeu
knocked down twice his seconds threw
up the sponge. He did not know how
to hit and could not land a blow on his
opponent.
SPECTATORS JEER AT JUDGES.
Jack O'Brien did all the fighting in
his bout with Bob Ritchie, but the
sympathies of the spectators were with
the latter. They jeered the decision
of the judges. The demonstration last
ed several minutes.
Mike Synfy failed to appear for hl3
fight with Bob Cairns and John Mc-
Ginty was substituted. The latter was
in no condition. In the third round
Cairns landed a blow to the body. Mc-
Ginty went down and feigned that he
had been knocked out. He .writhed
around on the mat while nine was be
ing counted. After the fight was
awarded to Cairns McGinty pretended
he wanted to go on, but his looks were
not in keeping with his brave talk.
He Â« was well pleased to get out of the
affair" as easily as he did. â 
-'\ The second round of the fight be
tween Jim Fox and George Murray
was an exciting encounter. They
slugged from the start, Fox "doing the
cleaner hitting! He finally sent Mur
ray to â¢ the , mat with â¢ repeated rights
and lefts to, the Jaw! Murray went
down, linder, the onslaught and seemed
all out.- He '.was game and got to his

two weeks looking after thÂ« Interests
of the New Orleans -Jockey Club. Cor
rlgan'said- he has' bought many shares
In the new track and' that everything
Is In shape to' begin racing within four
orjQya' flays. .
" 'T-hava' not had jany word from Mr.
D.evereanx "^ sine* I saw him hÂ«rÂ« la
Chicago two weeks ago," said Corrl
gan. "But he will be here January 3.
with other, turf men who are-dissatis
fied" with the allotment of dates mads
by. tb,e Western Jockey Club at tha last
meeting.
, "We. will 'do nothing now until we
see, what the Western governing body
will do at Its next meeting, on Janu
ary 3. ; It is well known by the stewards
that'a number of track owner* have
grievances, and we will wait to see
whethe'r there is any readjustment of
datea. If there Is not, I am confident
some -action will be taken toward the
running of Independent tracks.
\ "At New Orleans the track Is In shape
to start racing by the first of the year,
and I will say there will be racing there
this winter, no matter what the action
of the stewards will be at tha meeting
on January 3."
RICH STRIKE MADE
. . IN TOXOPAH DISTRICT
Miners Rushing to Undeveloped Por
tion of the Region, Where Rich
Ore Is Found.
RENO, Dec. 30. â One of the* most sen
sational strikes of the Tonopah mining
district was made early this week by a
prospector a few miles from Revllee,
Nev. The ore is free milling and the
assays average $500 per ton. ThÂ» ledge
Is several feet wide and, although tha
claim is still undeveloped. It promises
to be oae of the richest in Southern
Nevada.
The strike was made In an unde
veloped portion of the Tonopah mining
district and many prospectors and for
tune seekers are now rushing to tha
place for the purpose of staking out
claims. ,

BERLIN, Dec. 30.â A reckless driver
of a heavy truck came near running;
down the carriage of Empress Augusta

BRITT AFTER JABEZ WHITE.
Will Not Consider a Match With Lewis
Until the Other Affair Is Settled. '
Willie Lewis will have to wait some
time before he can hope to get a match
with Jimmy Britt. In the first place
Lewis is not considered a drawing card
as he has been beaten easily, in two
rounds by Rufe Turner while Jimmy
Gardner also defeated him.
Britt is anxious to fight Jabez White,
the English boxer. The latter does jio.t
class with Britt, according to reliable
reports, but the glamour of an inter
national match is expected to result in
attracting a large attendance.
Britt Is wining. to' try conclusions with
White, but.he.wants the match .decided
in this city. The gate re<?eipts will be
larger here than In any other part of
the. world under the present conditions
of the "sport.. ;
BATTLING NELSON PLANS
1 ; r 'AX EXTENDED VACATION
Great Danejrt'lll Take a Needed Rest
Before He . Signs Up for
. ,,nAnother Fight.
Battling Nelson is planning to make
a getaway to the woods for an extend
ed hunting trip. The great Dane has
evidently tired. of the glare and glit
ter of the tenderloin and awakened to
the fact that a butterfly existence will
not make, a real champion out of him.
;Hp will start In a few days for the
mountains, there to hunt wild animals
and try to forget about soubrettes arid
nine-ounce gloves for the time being."
Teddy Murphy stated last night that
his charge was in perfect physical con
dition and tlaaf he was not a lad who.
went the pace and tried to be the
main parader of O'Farrell street.
Murphy says he will leave for the East
in a few days, but would join Nelson
as soon as the latter has rested up
and feel in a humor to take on soma
good man.
The Dane has no definite plan -of
action outlined, but he will probably
be signed to meet some one here in
February. It may : be Corbett or It
may be Britt once again. Murphy
says he will continue to manage Britt
just as though nothing had happened."

PREVENTS PETTY CRIME
It Is Believed That Use of
the "Cat" Would in Great
Measure Stop Wife Beating
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â In a re
port submitted to Chief Justice Alvey
ot the District of Columbia Supreme
Court to-day the Grand Jury recom
mended the establishment of the whip
ping post as a means of punishment
for wife beaters. The penalty was first
suggested in President Roosevelt's an
nual message to Congress, and the
Grand Jury recently took it up for
discussion. By a majority vote it re
corded its approval of whipping posts
not only for wife beaters, but for petty
larceny offenses. The Grand Jury says
In its report:
"The desirability of establishing the
whipping post as a means of punish
ing wife beaters and petty larceny of
fenses has been investigated by this
body, and a majority of the members
are of the opinion that it would prove
very effective in decreasing the num
ber of these reprehensible crimes."
The President in his message dis
cussed district affairs and it having
been brought to his attention that there
were from one to three cases at wife
beating in Washington each day and
that the offenders were usually sent to
the Workhouse, while the wife and
children suffered, he suggested some
form of corporal punishment. Since
then there has been a wide discussion
ending in the endorsement of the idea
erf a whipping post by the Grand Jury
to-day.
While there is a large colored popu
lation in the whipping
post is not suggested because the negro
men are the more numerous offenders.
It is said that the cases . are about
equally divided between the blacks and
whites and if the whipping post should
be set up there is little doubt that
blacks and whites alike would be pun
ished with the "cat."
HIGH HONOR CONFERRED
UPON* COUNT CASSINI
Czar Decorates Him With the Order
of Alexander Nevsky in
Diamonds.
WASHINGTON, Dec 20.â Count CaÂ«
eini, the Russian Embassador, to-day
received notice from Count Lamsdorf,
the Russian Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, that the Emperor has conferred
upon him the order of Alexander Nev
sky in diamonds. This is the "highest
grade of this distinguished order.
Count Cassini was : previously given
the lower grade, but the order in dia
monds is one of the highest distinctions
the Czar bestows on the servants of the
Government who have performed long
and distinguished services. The only
other members of. Russia's diplomatic
service who have this order of Alex
ander Nevsky in diamonds are the
Russian Embassadors in Rome and
Berlin.
Count Cassini has probably more
decorations than any diplomat in
Washington, as his service has been
much longer and more varied than that
of any of his colleagues. He wears
the Order of the Legion of Honor, be
stowed by France: the Order of the
Double Dragon, which was conferred
upon him during his service as Russian
Minister at Peking, and the Order of
the Red Eagle, which he received from
the Emperor of Germany.
MEXICANS KILL A MAN
FOR BOTTLE OF WHISKY
Brutal Murder Is Committed After
Slayers Had Spent Night With
Their Victim.
PHOENIX. Ariz., Dec. 30.â Edward
Porter, a blacksmith, was fiendishly
murdered last Saturday night. Porter
went to a saloon some miles from the
railroad construction camp where he
was employed after finishing his day's
work, meeting two Mexicans he knew,
named Jose Martinez and Joe Carson.
En route home over a lonely mountain
trail they killed Porter to get posses
sion of a bottle of whisky, crushing hia
head and cutting his throat. Dragging
the body to the Gila River, t they dis
emboweled it and threw it * in. The
murderers have confessed. S't^i

DR. CHADWICK

INSANITY HER PLEA
Further Indications That
She Will Offer It as an,
Excuse for' Her Actions
NEW YORK, Dec. 30.â The steam
ship Pretoria, from Hamburg, Dover
and Bologna, bearing Dr. Leroy Chad
wick of Cleveland, the husband of Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick, as a passenger,
arrived here early this morning.
CLEVELAND, Dec. SO.â Bertillon
measurements were taken of Mrs.
Chadwick to-day by a Government
secret service expert. The purpose of
the system is the identification of crim
inals.
Investigation discloses that there are
no Bertillon measures of Mme. Devere
on record at the Ohio penitentiary. The
system was in vogue prior to her com
ing to the prison, but it had been dis
continued when she was incarcerated.
Since then the system -has been re
stored. The prison record contains a
very minute description of Mme. De
vere, however.
TO RELY OX INSANITY.
Dr. C. J. Aldrich, the alienist, again
called at. the county jail to see Mrs.
Chadwick to-day, but upon instructions
issued by United States Marshal
Chandler he was refused admittance.
Dr. Aldrich stated that he was making
a study of Mrs. Chadwick at the re
quest of her counsel.
Several other matters developed in
the Chadwick case to-day that seem to
indicate insanity as her almost certain
line of defense. It was leaned that Dr.
H. C. Tyman, superintendent of the
Masslllon State Hospital for the Insane,
made an examination of the woman
last Tuesday. Dr. Tyman's visit was
kept secret at the time. He is one of
the ablest and best known practical
alienists and specialists on insanity in
Ohio.
SIGNIFICANT CONFESSION.
CHICAGO, Dec. SO. â Did the far
famed Ohadwick securities originate
in Pitteburg? This was the question
raised in local police circles to-day,
following the confession said to have
been made to Detective Wooldridge by
S. J. Jacobs, who was sentenced to
two years in the penitentiary yester
day for alleged "wildcat" insurance
operations.
According to Detective Wooldridge,
Jacobs told him a story of his alleged
relations with Mrs. Chadwick, saying
that some time ago the woman was
in Chicago and broached to him a
plan whereby they were to go to New
York, and, in Mrs. Chadwick's re
ported phrase, "clean up Wall street."
Jacobs is reported to have said that he
thought seriously of the project, but
that his wife was jealous of the Chad
wick woman and he therefore gave
It up. :-:y--
This confession, together with the
police knowledge of Jacobs' alleged
propensities for manufacturing worth
less securities, caused the authorities
to suspect that the "Carnegie note" and
other securities, which certain Eastern
men said they "would rather die than
tell about," came from Chicago.
HANDSHAKE DELAYED
ADMISSION OF STATE
Why New Mexico Was Not Admitted
to the Union Some Thirty ':. ''
Years Ago.
"A handshake once cost New Mexico
statehood," said Bernard S. Rodey.
Territorial Delegate, who is working
day and night to have the land of cacti
admitted to the Union.
"It was in 1874, when the bill was
up giving statehood to New Mexico
and Colorado. Senator S. B. Elklns of
West Virginia, was then delegate from
New Mexico. He was younger than at
present and not so widely known, and,
naturally, he wanted friends. Senator
Burrows of Michigan, then represented
a Michigan district in the House. One
of those hated force bills was up be
fore fcongress, and Mr. Burrows had
made a hot speech in favor of It. Mr.
.Elkins was In the cloakroom, and did
not know what Mr. Burrows had been
talking about, but he did know that
the Michigan man had been making a
hot speech, for he had heard the ap
plause. When Mr. Burrows had fin
ished Mr. Elkins rushed out of the
cloakroom and, meeting Mr. Burrows,
warmly shook both his hands.
"The Southern members had been
listening and were in no very happy
mood after the lashing that they had
received. They knew what Mr. Bur
rows had said, and they saw Senator
Klkins extend his effusive congratula
tions. Now it happened that Senator
Elkins needed just fourteen Southern
votes to have his statehood bill called
up, and he had arranged for them. In
fact, they were going to call up and
pass the New Mexico measure and let
the Colorado "measure wait. A South
erner walked straight up to Mr. El
kins. 'If those are your sentiments,
Mr. Elkins, your territory can remain
out of the Union until it rots before it
will come in with our votes,' said the
irate . Representative. . Sixteen others
from the South who had been former
ly well disposed seconded the declara
tion of their colleague. And they kept
their word."
Mr. Rodey says that New Mexico
has been knocking at the door of Con
gress for. statehood since 1850. It made
an effort when California became a
State. Later a claim of Texas to a por
tion of the territory prevented New
Mexico from landing. The United
States bought off Texas for $10,000,000,
but it prevented New Mexico from get
ting into the Union.
According to Mr. Rodey Senator Bev
eri<Jgewill call up the statehood meas
ure after the holidays. - It will be made
unfinished business In the Senate,' arid
: will -be pushed through. The one thing
Mr. Rodey fears is filibustering against
the bill, ' which â  would : prevent a i vote
this session. "If we have ; a ' vote the
States- will be admitted," said Mr.
RodeyJlBBfHj

MAKES REPORT
ON MANEUVERS
General MacArthur Gives
Official Account of the
Encampment at Atascadero
FAVORS A CONTINUANCE
Says California Militiamen
Greatly Benefited by the
Sojourn With tlie Regulars
WASHINGTON, Dec. SO.â General
MacArthur, commanding the Pacific di
vision, in his report on the Joint ma
neuvers held during the summer at
Atascadero, Cal., and at American
Lake, Wa^h., says the most notable
event connected with the maneuvers
resulted from the resourcefulness of the
signal corps under Lieutenant Goodale
at American Lake, -where, under the
pressure of emergencies, many ingen
ious and valuable electrical demonstra
tions were made. The report recom
mends a permanent continuance of the
maneuvers. In a special report on the
California maneuvers General MacAr
thur, speaking of thÂ« results of the
training received by the troops, quotes
a colonel of & California regiment as
6aying that they had learned that It
was necessary to march fifteen miles
to fight fifteen minutes and says:
"The formulation of such a truthful
and almost classical epigram as the re
sult of experience gained during the en
campment is in itself of sufficient im
portance to Justify the entire expense
of the undertaking."
Major William P. Duvall, chief um
pire at the maneuvers at Camp Atas
cadero, Cal., In his report says the dis
tinct advantages of these field exercises
were demonstrated everywhere.
The report of Assistant Adjutant Gen
eral Evans, chief of the umpires at the
maneuvers held at American Lake, par
ticipated in by the troops of the regu
lar army and militia from Idaho,
Washington and Oregon, tells of the
problems worked out and makes a
number of recommendations, the prin
cipal one of which Is that the Govern
ment should own its own maneuver
grounds because of the difficulty in ad-
Justing claims for damages, some of
which are declared to have been ex
orbitant. Major Evans regards the
site occupied at American Lake as ad
mirably adapted for military maneuver
purposes and ideal as a point of de
parture for troops requiring transporta
tion on the Pacific Ocean.
A National University.
The idea of a national university
at the capital city of the country,
which has been long discussed and
received the favor of many promi
nent educator.! and others, is said to
have a prospect of being in a man
ner realized, with Columbian Univer
sity at Washington as the nucleus. A
movement was started, or rather re
newed, a couple of years ago for fur
thering the national university
project, and It appears that those who
were identified with it have been giv
ing some attention to the matter since,
with the result that the plan promises
to take practical form. While there
are many educators who are favorable
to a national university of the scope
and character suggested by the first
President, with whom the Idea orig
inated, there are others who doubt
whether such an institution would be
of great value, chiefly for the reason
that It might fall under political or
sectarian influence. There la certainly
force in this view, yet it does not seem
altogether impracticable to so organ
ize a national university as to pretty
effectually safeguard it against such
a danger. The question as to whether
there is need of such an educational
institution is one as to which opinions
may differ. The country is well sup
plied with colleges and universities
that are among the best In the world
and are steadily improving. Still a
distinctly national university, con
ducted on sound principles, might
prove a* highly valuable addition to
our seats of learning, and certainly
no friend of higher education will
oppose such an institution. Surely
there could be no worthier memorial
to the "father of his country." â Oma

New York Stock Market.
| NEW YORK. Pec. 30. â To-day's reaction in
? * . â  received" various explanations, but did
â¢sint materially imiiair the confidence with
I -which the outlook upon the n<nv year is re
â Fardrd. Tlie eUffcr.ing of the call loan rat<" dur-
JiriK the. day was the most immediate apparent
tt-auw rtf the telling. The surprising lact is
*t*;t;t xYic ri^o in tÂ»!l money was deferred until
K.J ractically tht Uust day of the year on the
â  Mock Kxchar^c Loans made on Friday at
Vtr.; Stock Exchange carry over until Monday,
wand in t-iÂ£ case until Tuesday. Preparations
t^ave luti-n rajJcing for thiÂ» largest January 1
â  itiisbursfrner.ts in the history of Wall Btreet.
l&he call l'ian rate has bÂ«-en apathetic up to
'l&nie.. and the maximum rate touched to-day
fkpea* 5 jier cent. Mt-antime the usual estimates
Mpy tinkers indicate that the inflow of currency
iMiy txpress iia> betii sufficient tp offset the Sub
ijibY' aMiry absorption and leave a margin of
L%'H.:: <rf upward of ?Â»,<XJU,CO0. The changes to
â  flae abowa In the loan item of to-morrow's
"--tiank statement are likely, of course, to tie
hi.tv owing to the annual settlements. But
a large influx of cash is looked for In the
':<>xt week. It is not probable tluU any deep
inxiety over the money market was reflected
n the day'p movements. I^ri_fit-taklng was a
jjore iikely motive. The meady uplift of
. rric*aÂ» 3na.e devflope<l litrl* inclir.ation to Fell
\ stocks uj> to. to-day, ujni up to y*N.t-rday there
kati been little awrt-arance of trading . for a
turn in the operations Din th* market. The
animation m lhe market . yesterday
â  Wid the oarly luarkat to-day were distinctly
kVeatures of this character, and was accom-
RiarJt-d bv more cr le*;s obrtoun manipulation.
Ijpiie profit-taking which met the movement
.mo-day was the usma! ccnccmltajit of a move
ypnfnt of a ejieculatlve nature. It served a* an
â .!..â  a too rapid riÂ»e In prices
jftv.-Gu'.'i havÂ»- to reckon vrith selling to realize.
3f.AmHU;airi8ted Copper iJisplayed rather acutely
V^4he n-actionary efTect of the speculative opera-
Li ion? which caused its wide advance yester
lay. The B^IlinjE waa not explained by new?
I j>-aring on values in the general llÂ»t. There
*-at tin faggtesKive speculation in Union Pa-
I -ifir. The varfnuF movements were abpn
5 ioried on the reaction. Laet prices were not
;it, from the iuwe.Â«t. and the closing wajs
Uf Bonds were irregular. Total sales' <par
FfialueJ. $41220,000.
t Cnited Sutef bDndst were unchanged on call.

CHICAGO BOARD OP TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Dec. 30.â Heavy liquidation by
a prominent holder to-day entirely â  wiped out I
a sharp advance in wheat prices.* Tha market
closed weak, with May down %@%c Corn,
oats and provisions were practically un
changed.
A stampede of belated shorts resulted in an
advance of over lc in the price of May wheat
during the first hour of trading. Influenced
by higher cables and exceedingly small re
ceipts in the Northwest, opening prices showed
a fair gain. May . being up %c to %c, at
$1 14Mi&l 14%. On an urgent demand from
shorts and several prominent commission houses
additional gains were made, the price rising
quickly to $1 15% before any considerable
supply of offerings was dislodged. Some small
holders then took advantage of the advance
to secure profits. The result was a reaction to
$1 14%. An active demand from Northwestern
houses which seemed to indicate a belUf in
a further reduction of receipts in the .North
wegt gave renewed encouragement to the local
bulls and the buying became aggressive. May
{sold up to $1 15%. For a time the market
continued extremely' strong, with prices near
the highest point. Late in the day sentiment
suddenly changed and a sharp reaction occur
red. One conspicuous feature of late trading
| was heavy selling by the leader of the bulls.
The claim was made that 2,000,000 bushels
I were sold by this one operator. Pit traders
, were quick to follow the lead and the selling
I was quite general during the last hour. A
report of a St. Louis trade paper was con
! strued as bearis-h, the report stating that the
winter wheat crop had been greatly benefited
by recent rains and snows. Under this selling
pressure May dropped to $1 13%. The market
I closed weak and practically at the lowest
! point, nnal quotations on May being at $1 13%
SI 13%. 'â â¢â >â¢â  ' - - ,
\ Early in the day the advance in wheat had
a strengthening influence on the corn market.
May closed at 45%c.
The volume of trading in oats waa a Blight
improvement over that of recent day*. May
closed at 31%@31%c.
An Inclination to take profits had a weaken
ing effect on the provision market. Trading
wns largely local. At the close May pork was

a nhadc lower.

. Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, -Dec. 30.â The close of the Boston
wool market for the year 1004 Is characterized
by remarkable shortages In the wool on hand*
In fact, the scarcity of the supply Is occa
sioning traders In this, the chief wool market
of the United States, considerable apprehen
sion as to whether serious conditions will be
encountered before the arrival of a. new clip.
The Boston Commercial Bulletin has Just
completed its annual canvass of the wool
supply of the country- It will say to-morrow
that Boston greets 1905 "with a startling situ
ation." It finds that the supply of wool, do
mestic and foreign, on -hand unsold here, Is !
the smallest carried over in 15 years. The j
Journal reports that there are of ail kinds of ,
wool only 29.000,000 pounds on sale In Boston
and that of this small total but 23,60O,000'Â»are
domestic. Only '42,000,000 pounds of domestic
wool Is left unsold In the United States,
against 112.0OO.COO last year. The total supply
of forclifn unsold grades Is 'but . 11,500,000
pounds. The total supply of all kinds In 1 the
country Is less than pounds. This
is said to be the smallest supply on hand In
the United States tn a lonsr time.
It should be stated that the mills are heavily
stocked and that millions of pounds belott- 'ng
to them and not for sale still are stored .8

WHEATâ The foreign markets continued
tame. ; Chicago advanced, but fell back again.
This market showed little change.
The Chicago wires of K, F. Hutton & Co.
eaid: "Broomhall cables Argentine offers
somewhat firmer. Harvesting of Wheat con
tinues to make satisfactory progress and
threshing reports from the north are more
favorable. Duluth and Minneapolis stocks in- .
crease 710,000 bushels r this week. Modern
Miller reports winter Wheat crop greatly bene
fited by moisture, the plant being in excellent,
condition. This haa been the third day of
the advance, culminating In a stampede of
shorts Smi a reaction owing to the limited
: market conditions, which was to be expected. .
/We see* little In the action of to-day's market
' to cause us to change our former views and
feel that the market will continue to bs Â«
good trading affair."

Poultry and Game.
There was continued firmness In all descrip
tions of live Poultry, receipts being light and
the demand steady, and the market was prac
tically bare at the close. Quotations were
unchanged, but most Ijandlers were expecting
a higher range of prices for Chickens. Dressed "
Turkeys were firm under light receipts, only
157 cases being . received, and an advance of
one cent per pound was readily obtained for
the best offerings. Prices may go higher to
day, as Eastern chilled stock is cleaned up
and! according to advices from the interior,
supplies of local stock are about exhausted.

Wife of Wine Merchant Says
Adopted Son Struck His
Foster Father and Mother
Garden spades and murderous looking
carving knives were placed in evidence
yesterday during the early stages of
the Monnier will contest in Judge Gra
ham's court, and the hired man of the
family, Bernard Souarn, testified
through the Interpreter that they fig
ured in the many Monnier quarrels.
For the rest of the day, Mrs. Monnier
Sr. was on the stand and told of the
many violent scenes and assaults that
occurred. She described In detail the
last ciays and death of her husband.
Frequent crying Interrupted her testi
mony.
On redirect examination by George D.
Collins, Mrs. Monnier became quite in
dignant at the persistent objections to
the line of questions by Sullivan and
Roche, attorneys for the contestant, re
garding the conversations of the elder
couple respecting Monnler's permitting
George Monnier Jr. and his wife to re
main at the home on Folsom street.
She exclaimed from the witness stand,
"It's the truth that I tell, it's the truth,
and George knows it, for he lies when
he is on the stand. Tou all lie!"
Sullivan asked if she meant that he
lied. "No," replied Mrs. Monnier. "but
George does." ; . "..â ..
Mrs. Monier said that Violet Monnier
caused much trouble, and quarreled
continually, and that George and his
wife often 6ent their little girl Flossie
to her to obtain money on the pretext
that it was wanted for clothing.
The witness testified that one early
morning when she called at George's
Toom to get a key, he called her names,
and, opening the door struck her. vio
lently on the head, throwing the key
Into the halL This testimony was fol
lowed by arguments between counsel
over the admission of alleged hearsay

Mrs. Monnier described the signing of
the will, at which time her husband ap
peared sane and In good health. She
then told of his worry over money mat
ters and approachlnr Insanity, until
the time when they were compelled to
etr&p him to the bed, so violent did he
become. For short Intervals he was re
leased, but was frequently given
cplate* until his death.

ELECTION BOARD
WINS ON POINTS
Accusation Faulty Because
It Was Not Concurred In
by Twelve Grand Jurors
The tangle in regard to the accusa
tion of the Grand Jury charging the
Election Commissioners with misfeas
ance in office is more involved than
ever. Judge Lawlor having decided
yesterday afternoon that the accusa
tion should have been concurred in by
at least twelve members instead of ten.
The. Judge made It clear? however, that
his decision would not ba a bar to the
present Grand Jury filing another ac
cusation.
When the case was called Secretary
Welsh of the former Grand Jury was
called and he testified that when the
vote was taken on the accusation ten
voted in the afllrmative and seven in
the negative.
In regard to other - points raised by
Attorneys Cator and Johnson on mo
tion to quash the proceedings and de
murrer the Judge thought it advisable
to give his decision. He held that the
view that the Mayor was vested with
exclusive authority to remove officials
was not in accordance with the law.
He also held that the defendants were
not immune from prosecution because
they had testified before the Grand
Jury.
The defendants scored a point, how
ever, in asserting that the accusation
should have been in the name
of the people. The Judge agreed
with them, but intimated that
it would not be a .bar 'to = an
other accusation. When the accusation
was first called in court objection was
taken to the process that it was not In
the name of the people. The point was
argued for, some days and finally the
Judge held that it was well taken, as
the proceedings were criminal in their
nature. A new. citation was Issued in
the name of the people and bearing the
seal of the court, but it was objected
that the accusation itself had not been
changed and was not in the name of
the people. This was the point that thÂ©
Judge held yesterday was well taken.

Two of the Emergency Hos
â¢ pital Surgeons Are to Be
Ousted From the Service
SUKPEISES EXPECTED
Chief Stephen Says That
Many. Shifts Will Be Made,
but Knows No Details
If Dame Rumor knows what she Is
talking about, Ruef's political ax is be
ing sharpened for a general decapita
tion bee to be held at the Emergency
Hospitals on January 1. Those who
wish to be beheaded can have their
wish gratified; those who do not will
be beheaded without the usual cere
mony.
According to the present schedule two
of the emergency surgeons will go out
and their places will be filled by disap
pointed candidates for the Job when the
last lot received their appointments.
Dr. Stephen, who draws the chief sur
geon's pay, says there will be a great
many changes at the beginning of the
new year, but professes not to know
Just what they will be. He Is undoubt
edly right, for the 'present Board of
Health seldom takes him Into confi
dence in the making of changes.
The two physicians who are said to
be slated for the shelf are Drs. Herzog
and Wilson. The latter is a good sur
geon and has served for some time.
There are also rumors of more
changes In the stewards and nurses of
the hospitals., The ambulance drivers
will not In all probability be affected
by the changes, as they are about to go
through a civil service examination for
the permanency of their positions. One
change has already become known.
Miss Katherlne Wynne will give way
to a Miss Hart, a former attache of the
Central Emergency Hospital.
The secretary of the Board of Health
admitted that wholesale changes would
be made, but refused to give any fur
ther information.'
POHEIM'S AMBITION.
Will Quit Health Board tq Seek Po
lice Commissioner-ship.
It was ascertained yesterday on
what appears to be reliable information
that Dr. Joseph Poheim, present mem
ber of the Board of Health, will retire
from that office upon the expiration of
him term on January 9 next, to as
sume some other office in the gift of
Mayor Schmitz. Poheim has aspira
tions to be Police Commissioner to suc
ceed Howell and is backed by some
strong Influences. Whether Pohelm's
ambition will be gratified, or not the
Mayor has not yet announced.
It ;s said that if the Police Commis-
Blonership goes to some other man,
Poheim will bÂ« appointed as superin
tendent cf the Pure Food Department,
a new position to be created by the
Health Board. Dr. George Drucker is
still In the running for Police Commis
sioner and his friends are making val
iant efforts in his behalf.
A new candidate for secretary of the
Police Commission to succeed Cadwala
der has appeared In Alexander O'Grady,
an attorney, who made speeches for
Schmitz during the latter's last cam
paign. George Maxwell at one time
seemed to have the inside track. for the
place, but ether interests prevent his
acceptance thereof. The secretaryship
pays $125 per month and is under civil
service, although there is no eligible
list for it at present.
Regarding the probable appointments
on the various boards and municipal
commissions there seems to be no
change in the situation as already told
some weeks ago in The Call. Thomas
F. Egan looks to have the call for
Commissioner of Public Works to suc
ceed Casey, but the wise ones are pre
dicting that a dark horse will come un
diÂ«r th<Â» wire first and beat Eg in.
School Director Altmann, Fire Com
missioner Wreden, Election Commis
sioner Voorsanger and Civil Service
Commissioner Rogers are sure of ] be
ing reappolnted to -succeed themselves.
It is understood that Rogers will give
up his office, probably in March, to ac
company Congressman-elect Hayes to
Washington as secretary. In that
event David J. Oliver will succeed to
the vacancy, the Mayor having given
Oliver assurance that he will be pro
vided for.
Dr. Jules Simon will be named on
the Health Board, but the Park Com
mlsslonershlp is In doubt, although
William H. Metson seems . to stand a
fine chance for appointment thereto.
Mayor Schmitz stated yesterday that
the official announcements will not be
made until next Friday night.

Golden Gate Council No. 80 of the

Theater last night with their friends
to witness a performance of Hoyt's
"A Contested Woman." ..The proceeds
were for/ the benefit of the widows'

tastefully decorated for the occasion
and the/ friends of the association
turned put and enthusiastically re
ceived the Majestic's excellent com
pany In the , famous comedy.
Besides the regular performance, in
which many local "gags" were inter
polated, the programme was varied by
a clever and entertaining series . of
lantern slide views, showing many of
the members of the association pic
tured in the many .vicissitudes .: of the
road and a few of the recreations. The
hit of the evening, however, was the
reading of a toast, cleverly introduced
by Howard Gould, referring to the love
of home in the heart of; every travel
ing man. The toast, however, was
neatly offset by Miss Esmond, who re
sponded to the . toast, "Our sweet

line "May they never meet." The re
sponse was greeted with rounds'of ap

FACES BIG SUIT
Lumber Company Brings
' Boycotting War to Supe
rior Court for Adjudication
CHAEGE OF CONSPIRACY
Mill Owners' Association Co-
Defendant in Action for
Damages and Injunction
Four years of warfare between the
unionized . building trades and the
Union Lumber Company â a fight far
reaching in effect and methodical In its
conduct between organized labor and
an industrial corporation, that has
been talked about and â¢ written about
all over the landâ has at last been
brought to a court of equity for settle
ment. The complaint was filed yester
day and assigned to Judge Sloss* de
partment. It Is more specific in its al
legations and more particular in its de
mands for relief than have been any
of the numerous suits against labor
unions that have yet been filed and
tried.
The Union Lumber Company, operat
ing lumber yards at Sixth and Channel
streets In this city and at Fort Bragg,
Is the plaintiff. Bush Finnell of the
Citizens' Alliance I? its attorney, and
C. E. "Wilson is of counsel. A perpetual
injunction and (damages In the sum of
$100,000 are asked, and a mere naming
of the defendants bespeaks the impor
tance of the action. A central labor
body, an association of owners and va
rious unions and individuals are put
on the defensive, the list including the
following: The Building Trades Coun
cil, the San Francisco Planing Mill
Owners' Association, the District Coun
cil of Carpenters, Millmen's Union
Local No. 422, Millmen's Union Local
423. the forty-eight officers of these or
ganizations, headed by P. H. McCar
thy and fifty "Does," supposed to rep
resent the unknown membership.
In October, 1900, the Union Lumber
Company withdrew from the Mill Own
ers' Association, and six weeks later
the association entered into an agree
ment with the Building Trades Coun
cil to operate their plants under union
rules. The Union Lumber Company
refused to concur and has been running
an "open shop" ever since. This 13 the
basis of the trouble.
COMPLAINT IS LOXG.
The complaint contains forty-five
typewritten pages and In the beginning
identifies- the various defendants.
Speaking of the Building Trades Coun
cil, It says that it is a secret, volun
tary, unincorporated association; that
it receives delegates from the various
unions engaged in the building Indus
tries. One of its functions Is, acting on
the initiative of proper local unions, to
determine when boycotts shall be In
stituted. Its rules, under the pain of
penalties and forfeitures, are enforced
against the union members and en
forced against employers by meftns of
strikes and boycotts. These rules pro
vide for hours of labor, compensation
for work, selection of employes,- re
striction of apprentices, etc. This bind
ing together of the unions, declares
the complaint, makes the rules a pow
erful engine If permitted to be en
forced for the oppression of members,
employers or material men.
The Planing Mill Owners' Associa
tion Is declared to be an organization
of persons owning, controlling and op
erating the principal planing mills in
this city and the State of California.
The State Building Trades Council,
says the complaint, while pretending to
represent the- counties of Alameda,
Sacramento, San Joaquin, Santa Clara
and Santa Cruz, is under the control of
the Building Trades Council . of San
Francisco. '
After these preliminaries, the com
plainant says that it was requested to
unionize its shop, but declined to do
so, leaving the matter to the free
choice of its employes and considering
the union rule,s as unreasonable and
an* Infringement upon the personal lib
erties of the plaintiff and its men. On
October 20, 1900, certain demands were
made upon the Mill Owners' Associa
tion by the Building Trades Council
with reference to the number of men
employed and the terms of their em
ployment. The plaintiff could not ac
cuiesce in the proposed subjection of
its business to the Building Trades
Council, and withdrew from the asso
ciation. When the other members en
tered into the agreement, It Is charged,
a conspiracy was entered into to co
erce the Union Lumber Company, "and
it was agreed to Inaugurate a boycott
against the concern and all persons
who did business with it.
BOYCOTT INAUGURATED.
It is alleged that on De
cember 1, 1900, with the deliber
ate intent to injure the company,- the
boycott designs were begun and have
been carried, on ever since. The com
pany'has been' declared "unfair," here
and at Fort Bragg; Its customers have
received oral and written notices- to
desist from patronizing it and many,
willing but afraid to-deal, have with
drawn their business.
I The complaint then gives* a list of
some of the customers who received
such notices. Among them were R.
Trost of 3336 Army street; George Ryan
of 28 Alabama street, who wa^ "cited
to show cause'',by the council why he
should not cease trading with the lum
ber company, and was told that he
would be fined $250 if he did it again.
Engle .: & Son, Fillmore and Francisco
srltets, forced to quit under threat of
flm;; E. P. Horn fined $100 for using
the f company's lumber^ not bearing a
union stamp, and fourteen others.
It is declared that agents of the
unions Vweht: to^Petaluma, Sacramento,
CorteMadera, Larkspur and Mill Val
ley and ' prohibited the local unions at
those places â â  from ; handling the firm's
lumber. . Jr A. ; Hopkins & Co/ of
Petaluma were compelled to return a
shipment of two carloads of lumber and
advised by the council'to . stop further
orders. Alist^of customers in outside
towns who have been intimidated, is
given.
Another, charge . is that the defend
ants maintained runners \ who followed
the -Union Lumber 'Company's
out* of the yards,', annoying; the drivers

; made."]; Upon freporting,^ the contractors

would bo boycotted and the mechanics
would be called on a strike. The com
plaint names several contractors who
were thus forced to send shingles and
lumber back to the company.
It is further asserted, that on
November 29, 1902, communications
were sent to the various build
ers' exchanges and associations notify
ing them of the boycott and giving al
leged reasons therefor. In these let
ters it was stated that no union man
would handle or place any lumber,
whether rough or plain, which was or
had been the property of the Union
Lumber Company.
Attached to the complaint are the
agreements between the Mill Owners'
Association and the Trades Council of
February 19, 1901, and June 16, 1903.
DAMAGES AND INJUNCTION.
In the prayer, damages for $100,000
are asked. Plaintiff asks for a perpet
ual Injunction restraining the perform
ance of acts complained of, interfering

the sale or contracts for Bale of lum
ber by representing that the buyers
will suffer loss of business; Interfer
ence by intimidation; interference by
sending notices or circulars through
the mails; interference by maintaining
runners to follow the plaintiff's
wagons; Interference by enforcing
fines, or expulsion of members of the
unions who handle the lumber; Inter
ference by using union labels on lum
ber not made by the plaintiff In order
to declare the plaintiff's lumber unfair.
A decree Is also demanded that the
council and the Owners' Association
shall rescind all oral or written notices
and requests made to persons or cor
porations, builders, contractors or
owners, not to purchase the company's
lumber.

OLD SUIT IS AT LAST
BROUGHT TO A TRIAI
Evidence Taken In Action Brought fa
1890 by Clerk Against Sanitary
Collecting Company.
The trial of the suit of Miss Annh
Goecken against the Sanitary Col
lecting Company, which was brough
In 1890 to recover $292 advanced b;
the plaintiff to the corporation, was
begun yesterday before Justice of thÂ«
Peace Daniels. I* R. Ellert. -who- Is
now dead; John Lackmann, former
Sheriff, and "Jake" Rauer were made
codefendants, but tha plaintiff con
sented to dismiss the action so far ai
they are personally concerned. Th#
corporation has been in Insolvency
proceedings in the United States cour
for fourteen years, which accounts f
the delay In bringing Miss Goecken
suit to trial. An attempt was mad,
to hold Lackmann individually re
sponsible for the claim through tha
overhearing by H. B. Goecken, father
of the plaintiff, in which Goecken al
leged Lackmann had promised hi;
daughter to pay the claim himself
Miss Goecken testified that while actr
lng as clerk for the concern she had
advanced $500 at a time when team
sters and other employes of the com
pany were clamoring for their wages
Sha had been paid back all but {232
The case went over for further evi
dence as to the company's liability lj
