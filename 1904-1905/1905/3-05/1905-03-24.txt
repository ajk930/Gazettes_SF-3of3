MRS. READER IS LIKENED
TO CASSIE L. CHADWICK
Woman Accused of Imposing
â â  Upon American Public.
WOMAN WHO CLAIMS THAT WITH HUSBAND SHE WAS COMMISSIONED BY
DOMINICAN PRESIDENT TO ARRANGE A TREATT WITH AMERICA AND
ATTEND TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE REPUBLICS DEBTS
!S"EW YORK. March 23.â Mr. and
Mrs. Athole B. Reader are now openly
accused of having imposed upon the
American public that interesting tale
.of -a treaty making pact with President
, Morales of Santo Domingo. Mrs.
.Reader was heralded bnÂ«adcast by the
press as a remarkable woman fliplo
rr.atist. who had risen from a type
writer's desk and developed into a
charmer of potentates, from whom she
obtained concessions worth millions.
It is now declared by Dominicans that
the never saw President Morales in her
life, nor did her husband.
To prove the contrary, however. Mr.
and Mrs. Reader this moraine Dub
lished a letter addressed to Senor-E.
Perez, signed with Morales' name. It
alluded to a certain interview that was
to have taken place, but it did not men
tion the Readers by name.
Those who are attempting to discredit
the story told by the Readers, to the
effect that they had been commissioned
to negotiate a treaty with the United
States and attend to the settlement of
the Dominican debt, intimate that the
case is very similar to that of Mrs.
Chadwick. They allege that the Read
ers, if they saw or corresponded with
Morales at ail, did so simply that they
might obtain something tangible upon
which to base a plausible story that
would interest capital in their plans.
Senor Emilio C. Joubert. Charee
d'Alfairescf theDomiriicanGovernment
who yesterday denounced the Readers'.
paid to-night that he did npt believe
the letter given out by Mr. and Mrs.
Reader, and alleged to have been writ
j- ten by President Morales, referred to
interviews regarding a treaty.
"I am positive that Reader did not
see Morales and talk with him on that
subject," said he. "The letter produced
by Reader is certainly written on offi
cial paper of the republic and the sig
nature is in the handwriting .of the
-President. But I insist that even if the
letter is genuine It had nothing what
*ever to do with the request for an in
terview on the treaty. â¢ â

WASHINGTON. March 23.â 1n the

Moncheur. tin New York, nothing Is
known at the Belgian legation regard-
Ing the reteren<e of President Morales,
in the dispatches from San Domingo
published to-day, to the Belgian claims,
which, the President says, are being
pressed. Several days ago Baron Mon
.cheiir received. from his Government a
cablegram asking if any investigation
were to be made by the American com
mission Into the Dominican situation.
It is supposed- that, in view of the
Senate's refusal to deal with the Do
minican matter, the Belgian Govern
ment feels it Is forced to pursue its
own course. Other European powers
also, while willing to await the nego
tiations of Secretary Hay, regard - the
attitude of the Senate as so opposed to
the proposed course of the Government
that they will bo obliged to act indi
vidually on the question.
The State Department officials have
by no means abandoned hope for the
Dominican treaty, and Secretary Taft
and Acting Secretary Ades have been
in conference -and in communication
with Senator f'ullom, chairman of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, respecting the procurement of
information and the collection of facts
and figure* which, it is expected, will

to the merits of the treaty that may

LOS ANGELES, March 23.â While
more than a score of persons were
sleeping on the second floor of the
Sunnyside rooming-house, 319 North
Broadway, at 3:30 o'clock this
morning, three rooms upon the first
floor were fired after kerosene had been
plentifully sprinkled on their contents.
One of the rooms in which a fire wav
6tarted adjoins the stairway and the
tiames cut oft' the escape of those upon
the- hour above. When the firemen ar
rived, the occupants of the upper rooms
vrcre huddled together on a small front
porch, some of them lying upon the
rioor to escape the smoke and heat.
All were safeiy rescued by the tlremen
by means of ladders, and one was in
jured during: the fire.
After the fire had been extinguished
the full extent of the plot of the in
cendaries was disclosed. AH the !>ed
clothing had been removed from the
rooms, and also portions of the other
furniture. In '. drawers of the
dressers oil-soak. <i paper had been
placed and in holes which had been
knocked in the plastering. rags
saturated with coal oil had been stuffed
in such a manner that had they
ignited the fire would have spread t->
all parts of the building. The carpets
had been soaked in coal oil and two
five-gallon cans of the liquid had been
spilled upon the floors of five rooms-.
The fires werr- not started in adioin
ing rooms. There was a room between
each of the oil-s-.aked rooms, the in
â¢ndiaries evidently hoping that the
fire would spread in both directions.
That it did not destroy the house was
due to the fact that the alarm was
given promptly. The Fire Department
deluged the place with six streams from
six engines.
The place was conducted by F. V
Tenny and his wife. Mrs. Tennv t< >Ul

GOVERNMENT PROPOSITIONS
ARE UNDER ADVISEMENT
United States Canal Commissioner Bristow made public yesterday, for the first time, the several propositions that have been pro
posed for the future use of the Panama Railroad and Steamship Line. These are, in summary:
That the Government shall use the road only in the construction of the canal.
That the commercial business of the road shall be maintained and that the route shall be kept open by the Government for com
merce, without increasing its facilities.
That the Government shall use the road for commerce and furnish adequate facilities for handling all the business that is offered and
make it efficient as a trans-isthmian line.
That the steamship line shall not be used by the Government to compete with lines of American citizens.
That the Government shall employ the steamship line for its own uses and also enlarge its commercial facilities.
That the steamships shall be sold.
That, if not sold, other ships shall be bought for the line and larger ones constructed.
That the Government shall renew the contract with the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.

MEETING IS LARGE
J. L.. Bristow, Federal commissioner,
appointed to inquire into the relations
of the Panama railroad and Panama
steamship line to commerce, told be
fore a larg-i gathering of San Fran
cisco- business men yesterday afternoon
the various views that have already
been submitted to the Government con
cerning this highly important matter.
This mv in the course of a discussion
by Mr. Bristow, intended to elicit the
views of San Francisco. A few speeches
were made in response. Resolutions by
Hugh Craig were introduced, but were
tabled.
George A. Newhall, president of the
San Francisco Chamber <>f Commerce,
presided. The meeting took place in
the assembly hall of Â» the Chamber of
Commerce, which was crowded. Busi
ness men in all lines of enterprise and
fecores of shippers were present. Long
before the time for opening the pro
ceedings all the seat 6 were occupied.
Many merchants could find only stand
ing room, but remained until the ad
journment. No statistics were sub
mitted for the enlightenment of Com
missioner Bristow, but arguments were
made. Throughout the proceedings the
closest interest attested the concern
that San Francisco has in the final
decision of the Government regarding
the use it will make of the isthmian
transportation line and its connections.
When the hearing ended Commission
er Bristow gave notice that he will be
at the St. Francis Hotel all this week,
and that he will welcome any com
munication offered. After Saturday
written communications should be sent
to Washington, D. C.
In the dearth of voluntary informa
tion yesterday the principal value of
the assemblage was found in the first
complete and definite statement that
has been made abc-ut ideas that have
been advanced elsewhere. This state
ment was contained in the remarks
made by Commissioner Bristow and
was appreciated, as was shown by the
attention that the gathering centered
on the topic under discussion.
R. P. Schwerin of the Pacific -Mail
Steamship Company and other officials
representing the transportation lines
that are desirous of having the present
conditions continued were present, but
they did not speak. They were atten
tive listeners.
President Newhall introduced Com
missioner Bristow. and after the com
missioner had concluded his remark 3
said that all were interested in the
question. The trustees of the Chamber
of Commerce had held two sessions
with Mr. Bristow and were preparing
to meet the public. The trustees would
very much like, at this meeting, to have
gentlemen express their views.
COMMISSIONER SPEAKS.
â  Commissioner Bristow spoke, in full,
as follows:

policy for the Government to pursue
in the management of the Panama
Railroad.
"The Panama Railroad was con
structed about flftv years &g6 by a
New York corporation, and has been in
operation since that time. When the
French company undertook to con
struct a canal across the Isthmus of
Panama it found it necessary to pur
chase a majority of the stock in this
railroad in order to secure advantages
which the railroad had under its con
cession from the Colombian Govern
ment. When the United States Gov
ernment purchased from the French
company the canal property and de
termined to construct the Panama
canal it secured* as part of the as
sets of that company, the Panama
Railroad, that is. about 98 per cent, of
the stock.
"The Panama Railroad some years
ago â the exact number I do not now re
member â purchased a line of steam
ships and established a steamship line
running from Colon to New York,
Colon being the Atlantic terminus of
the Panama Railroad, and is operating
that line at this time. When the Gov

ent time by the same company and the
1 same officers that were operating it at

"This is the first railroad. I believe,

It came into possession of it Incident

not the business of the Government to"
operate a steamship line; "that â  the
ocean is a highway free, to commerce;
lhat private enterprise will orpa'nize
fteamship companies for the purpose of
handling commerce, and that our Gov
ernment should not conduct -a steam
ship line in competition with its own
citizens. . .. V '. ''.'â¢.
"There are others who believe that.
since this line is established and since
the United States Government will
have a. great deal of its own freight
to transport from the United States to,
the Isthmus of Panama, it should re
tain the steamship line and continue
to operate it to handle its own busi
ness, but since it has this line in oper
ation, and since it has been established
as a commercial line, it ought to con
tinue its commercial facilities and con
tinue to transact commercial business
and that it even ought to enlarge its
facilities and improve them for the
handling of increased commerce which
they think will be brought to this line
as a result of the construction of the.
canal. One party advocates the sell
inirt>f the steamship line; another party
advocates the purchasing of other ships
and the construction of larger ones.
"On the Pacific Fid" of the isthmus

contract with the Pacific Mail Steam

Mail Steamship Company is given the
right of free bills of lading from New

been made that this contract is in vio

used in restraint of trade and com
merce by the isthmian route: that it is
controlled by â  transcontinental rail

interest of the transcontinental rail
road. â¢ 1 =
"There are others -who contend that,
while the contract may not be Justi
fiable from some points of view, it is
the wisest traffic relation that could
be provided because the business trans
acted by way of Panama is sÂ»ch that
if it is divided among many competing
steamship lines it will not justify any
line in maintaining .a regular ' yervlcu,

and that it is to the commercial inter
ests of San Francisco that the schedule
should be maintained and that, there

IRISH EXPRESSES VIEWS.
Thinks Regular Private IJncs to Isth-
mus Should Be Maintained.
John P. Irish said that he appeared
for the California State Board of
Trade. There were reasons 'why ih* '
construction of the Panama canal
would concern the commerce of San
Francisco." Part of the effect wag in
sight, and perhaps a considerable part
of the effect was n<>t yet visible. The
cutting of the canal would cause the,
commerce of the west coast of South
and '"entral America to take thf* short
er water route to New Y<>rk and San
Francisco would lose it. Only that
part (ff the trade that was made nec
essary by local consumption would be
retained here. Interference with an
American line of steamships between
San Francisco and the isthmus would
destroy the facilities for trade that
wiere afforded oy a schedule nf
service. The bÂ«>Ft facility that had
been enjoyed for communication with
the isthmus was provided by the Pa
cific Mail.
Mr. Irish advised that the Govern
ment se!l both the Panama road and
the Panama steamship line as soon as
possible, retaining only such privileges
in the Panama road ac were necessary
for use in the construction of the canal.
As the next best thing: to the sale out
right of the properties, he said that he
would advise the Government to lease
the Panama railway property and sell
the steamships, and get itself entirely
separated from transportation business.
If the Government should compete with
its own citizens in isthmian transporta
tion, why might it not compete every
where? Why might it not enter into
competition with its citizens and in
stall practically state socialism in any
part of the country? This Government
could not engage in competition with
ii? own citizens in transportation or
otherwise.
The speaker said also that the line
between San Francisco and the isth
mus had maintained a regular schedule
for fifty years. The line could not be
maintained without the contract that
provided for a through bill of lading
between San Francisco and the isth
mus. An American line originating in
San Francisco had to pay the port
wages of San Francisco, and if its
steamships were registered from this
port, they were subject to the exaction
of all municipal and State taxation.
No foreign ship would have to pay this
tax. The tax and the payment of port
wages from San Francisco would, with
the absence of the special privilege
enjoyed by the Pacific Mall because of
the through bill of lading over the Pan
ama road, strip one more line of flags
off the deep water, because the Ameri
can flag would disappear from that
route and tramp steamships would dd
th* business on any schedule they
might choose to make.
Th*> same question involved â - the
issue of the reinstatement of the
American merchant marine was here
involved. I? the existing contract was
abrogated and nothing in the way of a
protective arrangement made with the
Government, the trade carried in
American bottoms to the isthmus would
disappear, because there would be no
American bottoms on the line.
DESIRES COMPETTTTOX.
Isklor Jacobs Thinks Route Should
Be Open to All.
Isldor Jacobs spoke of the moving of
the products of California and claimed
that every facility was needed in that
direction. What California needed was
full and free competiuon in transpor
tation. Those who had goods to move
to market could not take any other
view of the matter.
While it would be well if all Califor
nia's products could be shipped in
American ' bottoms, the fact was that
nearly all the shipments by sea from
California to Europe went in foreign
vessels. "It should be the pni| ( y ..f
this Government," declared Mr. Jacobs,
"to opt-n the Panama road to free com
petition, and that will benefit the pro
ducers of California and every one in
thi.Â« State will receive a benefit."
Hugh Craig spoke briefly and lntro

duced resolutions in which it was de
clared that the people of San Francisco
desired that the Panama road should
be operated by the Government for the
benefit of all the people, under depart
mental control; that a square deal in
transportation might be assured to all
concerned: and that a steamship ser
vice should be operated by the Gov
ernment on both sides of the Isthmus,
making, with the rail connection, a
through route between San Francisco
and New York.
Frank B. Cole of Tacoma said that
the Northwest ought to be considered
in the present meeting. The northern
cities ought to have the same facili
ties as San Francisco.
John P. Irish objected to Mr. Craig's
resolutions on the ground that they
were out of order.
A. A. Wat kins also objected to the
resolutions. He said that he believed
that the best interests of San Fran
cisco would be served by continuing
the existing contract with the Pacific
Mail.
A. C. Rulofson agreed with Mr. Wat
kins that the contract with the Pa
cific Mail ought to be continued.
Mr. Craig's resolutions were tabled
on motion of John P. Irish, a motion
by Mr. Craig to have them referred
to a committee of seven having been
voted down.
General N\ P. Chipman. president of
the California State Board of Trade,
said that when the canal was opened
competition would be established. At
present that proposition did not seem
to roach out into the broad domain of
Socialism that his friend Irish saw.
He would have the gentlemen confine
their attention to what is best to do

C. B. Lastreti asked why mining and
agriculture in California should be
stifled to support a transportation line
that was reported to be unable to sup
port itself? He objected to the state
ment that the Pacific Mail had supplied
a regular schedule. Recently three
weeks passed without steamer service
on the Panama line. The traffic had
boon greater than the steamships could
handle.
This ended the day's hearing, as no
others offered to speak.

HAY-AVEBURY IiETTERS.
Foreign Holders of Colombian Bonds
Made Vain Appeal.
LONDON, March 23. â The council
of foreign bondholders to-day gave out
the correspondence exchanged be
tween Secretary Hay and Lord Ave
bury regarding Panama. Hay, in a
letter to Avebury, dated February 10,
said the United States could not with
hold further payments to Panama un
til the setlement of Panama's share
in the Colombian debt was arranged.
Hay's reason was that the council of
foreign bondholders were not citizens
of the United States and could not
claim the assistance of the American
Government.
Lord Avebury, in his reply to Hay,
dated March 10, said he regretted that
the American Government was un
able to comply with the council's re
quest. Referring to President Roose
velt's recent measure saying that the
especial reason for American inted
vention' in Santo Domingo was that
foreign Governments were pressing
their claims against the Dominican
Government, Lord Avebury says he
had hoped President Roosevelt would
be ready to assist trie holders of Co
lombian bonds, "whose claims are at
least as good as those of the Santo
Domingo bondholders, and who have
n ripht to special consideration in
view of the prejudice from which they
suffered in consequence of the seces
sion of Panama from Colombia.

MITCHELL GOES
AFTER A CLERK
Oregon Senator Orders Re
moval of Harry C. Robert
son by Canal Committee
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Ore., March 23.âDis
patches from Washington say that
Senator Mitchell to-day ordered by
wire that Harry C. Robertson, chief
clerk of the Committee on Interoceanic
I Canals, be dismissed and that the Sen
ator's grandson, John Mitchell Handy,
be given the place. Handy has been
drawing salary as assistant to Robert
son, but the work has been done by
Mrs. Debeerbower, who is now appoint
ed assistant.
"Yes, sir, I instructed that Robert-
Bon be removed as chief clerk of the
committee because of base betrayal of
confidential affairs," said Senator
Mitchell this afternoon when asked
concerning the report from Washing
ton. "The betrayal does not relate to
his testimony before the Federal trrand
Jury here. I do not know about that
and do not care anything about it. His
removal Is for the betrayal of matters
not connected with that case."
Senator Mitchell spoke with great
emphasis when he said "base betrayal"
and needed no prompting to answer
the inquiry. His feeling against his
former secretary and confidential man
was apparent." Robertson was sent
across the continent with the famous
"burn this letter" epistle from Mitchell
then at Washington, to Judge Tanner.
Mitchell's law partner, telling Tanner
how to throw the officers of the Fed
eral Government off his track. Chief
of Detectives Burns met Robertson on
his way to Portland and "took him di
rectly to the grand jury room, where
Robertson was induced to give up his
message."

riages allowed on the estate during the
funeral services, but . the long proces
sion will be entirely on foot..
The most beautiful as well as the
most touching feature of the funeral
will be the tloral display. Tons of
liowers have been received from all
over the United States. It was the
wish of Mrs. Stanford that there be
few ilowers within the Memorial
Church, and, save two small pieces on
the bier, all the flowers will be dis
posed around the mausoleum. The em
ployes of the stock farm will place
their floral offering just outside of the
door of the church. Each class and
each fraternity of the university, as
well as the many other organizations,
will spread their flowers in front of the
mausoleum. The senior class will give
white roses, the juniors white lilies of
the valley and the other two classes
will give Easter lilies. The women of
the university will prepare a special
floral piece. They had intended to dec
orate the room in the house where lay
the body of Airs. Stanford, but this was
changed because of the plans of the
immediate family.
STUDENTS TO BE PALLBEARERS.
The bier will be carried by eight stu
dents. Those who have been chosen to
act as pallbearers are W. E. Crawford

Promptly at 1:30 o'clock the great
organ In Memorial Church will begin
the melodious tones of Chopin's funeral
march and at the same moment the
bronze doors at the main entrance will
swing open to admit the little cortege
of pallbearers and relatives escorting
the coffin. Eight of Stanford's most
stalwart athletes will bear the body
down the central aisle, of the church
through the very midst of the thronged
congregation to the magnificent semi
circular chancel before it is placed in
front of the altar. The members of the
escorting party will take seats in a
section reserved for them, and the
funeral service will proceed.
No wealth of flowers will adorn the
chancel or altar. Only a few modest
clusters of white lilies and roses will
be used in the church, all the maenifi
cent floral tributes from friends being
reserved for the memorial decorations
at the mausoleum.
Following the funeral .march the
splendid choral song "To Thee, O Lord,
I Yield My Spirit," from Mendelssohn.

QUEER THEORY
ABOUT HAMLET
German Professor Declares
Characters in Play Typify
Temperament of the Hero
RIDES A MOTOR CYCLE
Dr. Conan Dole's Principal
Recreation Is a Bicycle
Propelled by Electricity
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March^ 23.â With a labori
ousness and convictions truly Teutonic,
Herr Heinrich, a German professor,
has just set forth what is about the
queerest theory yet propounded regard
ing Shakespeare's "Hamlet." The pro
fessor believes that all the characters
in the play were intended by Shakes
peare to be representations c-f the vari
ous sides of Hamlet's temperament and
this belief he elaborates in a brochure
consisting of over ninety pages of close
type, which has just been publishel in
the Fatherland under the title of "Die
Namen Hamlettragodie."
It demonstrates again that there's
practically no theory to-o absurd to be
substantiated, in a way, if you only
devote enough patience and ingenuity
to iho business. Professor Heinrich en
deavors to justify his assumption by
tracing the names of all the characters
In "HamlPt" to their source. The hero's
own appellation he traces back through
almost countless generations and shows
that it was originally Epelled both
Hambiet and Hamlet, and further de
clares that the name of Shakespeare's
son, Hamnet. is only a variation. Herr
Heinrich considers that Hamlet was
derived originally trom the old English
word â â¢hameiian." to halt or be lame,
and maintains that the name, there
fore, is intended to be symbolical of the
halting or indecisive side of Hamlet's
character. The name of Gertrude, the
professor" follows indefatigably through
the "Geruthe" of Belleforest to- the
"gery" Venus Qf Chaucer's "Knights
Taie," and he makes this name mean '
"the inconstant." "Laertes" is de- }
clared by the German savant to be de- j
rived from "leo" and "heart" and,
therefore, to stand for Hamlet's brav
ery. Polonius, the professor thinks,
stands for Hamlet's lack of yo-uth; Ho
ratio represents the philosophical and
skeptical sides of Hamlet's character;
Kos?en< rantz and Guildenst. j i"n stand
for craftiness and lack of will power,
and Osric, through the Latin "os"â
mouth â and German "reich" â full of â |
for the 10-ve of self-communing.
REMARKABLE DEDUCTION.
Most remarkable of all, however,
Herr Heinrich declares that the name
Ophelia must have been derived by
Shakespeare from either "Mephistu
pheles' or "offai," and in support of the
latter supposition he quotes the Dane's
comment, "a gc-od kissing carrion."
He says that Ophelia represents the
womanish side of Hamlet's character
and asserts that we have numerous in- j
stances in tohakt-speare of his poor
opinion of women. Herr Heinrich
brings his extraordinary thesis to a
clcse by asserting that Shakespeare
undoubtedly found the germ of his
tragtdy in the history of Mary, yueen j
of tocots, Darnley ai.d Boihwell, with
James 1 as the Piince.
Dr. Conaa Doyle is now at "Under- |
shaw." his picturesque country house
i at Hindheaa, Surrey, and is engaged
i on a new literary work, of whi-de na
: ture, however, he declines to give so
! much as a hint. The author's princi
1 pal recreation at present is motor-cy
ciing, a machine ot this surt having re
cently been added to his garage. Sir
| Arthur, of course, has been an emhusi
. astic inotcvist for several years, and
has two cars of ten and twenty horse
power respectively, but he says he pre
iers his new motor-cycle, which is a
Roc, for short distances, and expects
to make some lengthy tours on it as
soon as the weatner gets warmer.
Oscar Wilde's "De Profundis" is still
! the chief topic of talk in literary en-
Clea here. Numerous excisions were
made in the original by Robert Ross,
who published it, and I was told re
cently by one who had seen the manu
script that the parts cut out consist
of savage denunciations of one man. a
1 former triend of Oscar Wilde, these
diatribes occurring again and again in
his "literary will and testament." as
Wilde called the strange document
; composed in Reading Jail.
FINISHES NEW TRAGEDY.
GajNTiete a'Annunzio is in the midst
I of a ntw novel, the first he has at
tempted in several years, and has just
finished a new tragedy, which he has
named "The Light Under a Bushel."
It consists of two thousand verses and
the scene is laid in Peligno, in the ter
ritory of Aversa, a little town in the
Abruzzi, just on the eve of Pentecost
in the time of King Ferdinand I. One
oi the poets intimate friends, to whom
he has read his new play, declares that
the action is quick and. passionate â the
whole tragedy taking place between
I noon and night of the same day â and
| says the work is a miracle of accuracy
:in local customs and superstitions. It
is expected that the tragedy will be
produced in Milan about the middle of
April.
On April 2 one hundred years will
' have passed since the birth of Hans
i Christian Andersen, and most European
countries are getting ready to pay
honor to the memory of that delightful
writer of fairy tales. In Copenhagen,
several of Andersen's personal friends,
at whose house he was an almost daily
guest, have decided to publish different
; relics of him which they have pre
served up to this time and to devote
the proceeds of their sale to charity.
Among these relics is an uncommonly
lntoresting collection of pictures which
will be published in a portfolio. They
1 comprise Andersen's birthplace, several
j original photographs with a fac-simile
of his autograph, twelve reproductions
of silhouettes which Andersen himself
I cut out; selected leaves on which are
; pasted pictures and which bear his
; autograph, taken from picture books
I which Andersen himself made and t>re
i sentt'd to daughters of his friends: and
! a view of <4he Villa "Rolighed." where
, the author died. There will be Dublish
i ed, too. an etching which shows Ander
| sen when he was forty years of age,
and which is the more valuable as only
fifty copies were made of it. and even
now only a limited number of repro
ductions can be made. Quite a num
ber of hitherto unpublished stereo
scopic views of Andersen in the family
j circle of the Melchiors at the "Roliehed
i Villa" will also be issued, and lastly a
â  series of plates illustrating Andersen's
lifÂ» and work, with illustrations from
; his fairy tales.

Woman Learns She Is an

ped About a Tallow Dip
LUCK OF POOR FAMILY
Fragment of Newspaper May
Be Means of Enriching Pov
erty-Stricken Australians
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 23.â 1f her expec
tations are fulfilled, a poor woman in
Australia will owe a fortune of $50,000
to the purchase of a penny candle, and
three Other members of her family in
.England will be indebted to the same
humble source for another $50,000 each.
That will make $^00,0uu obtained
thiough a tallow dip.
This is how it happened. Mrs. Henry
Motlee with her husband emigrated to
Australia twenty years ago and set
tled in Ballarat. They met only with
bad luck. They couldn't afford nas.
Mrs. Motlee, about two months aeo.
sent one yf her children out to buy a
single candle. The storekeeper who
sold it wrapped it up in a stray piece
of a newspaper. When Mrs. Motlee had
lighted the candle with a piece of the
wrapper she chanced to glance over
the printed fragment and read there
something thai startled her. It was an
advertisement requesting Mrs. W.
Chapman, her two sisters and brother
to communicate with a certain London
lawyer that they might obtain posses
sion of an estate valued at $200,000.
Mrs. Mctlee is one of the sisters re
ferred to. She immediately wrote to
Mrs. Chapman, who lives at Yar
mouth, in England, telling her of the
discovery she had made and how she
had made it, and asking her to set
things to work to get hold of the
money. It is through Mrs. Chapmajfi,
who seems in a fair way to prove the
claims of her faimily to the fortune.
OLD ENGLISH ESTATE.
The estate in question was left in
1791 by Thomas Hawkins, a solicitor,
to his son Richard, who was also a
member of the legal profession and
settled at King's Lynn. This Richard
Hawkins had a son George and it was
because of the difficulty the latter
encountered in proving his father's
will that the estate was thrown into
chancery. George Hawkins was the
great-grandfather of the present
claimants to it. Mrs. Chapman has
still in her possession a portrait of
Thomas Hawkins and his family, em
broidered in silk, of a style fashion
able at the period in which he lived.
It was exhibited at an art loan exhi
bition some years ago and a curio col
lector then offered $300 for it. But
Mrs. Chapman, who has not been re
duced to buying penny candles, cher
ished it too much as a family heir
loom to part with it.
Another strange story has just come
to light concerning how a German wo
man is alleged to have discovered that
she is entitled to a share in the estate
valued at $2,500,000 left by Mrs. Helen
Blake, v idow of General Blake,

STUDENTS DEAL
DEADLY BLOWS
Two Deaths Are Expected
to Result From a Class
Fight at Colorado School
BATTLE LASTS ALL DAY
Many Sophomores and Fresh
men Badly Hurt in Strug
gle on a College Campus
GOLDEN, Colo., March 23.â After one
of the fiercest class fights in the his
tory of the School of Mines a score
of freshmen and sophomores are nurs
ing bruises, while two students prob
ably are fatally injured. They are
Harry B. Clapp of Denver, suffering
from concussion of the brain, and_ Ar
thur J. Weinig of Durango, who re
ceived internal injuries. Clapp was
kicked or. the back of the head.
The preliminaries of the fight began
at 2 a- m., when the sophomores raised
their flag over the school. At 3 o'clock
the freshmen appeared and took it
down. The incident was then thought
to be closed, until at noon the freshmen
hoisted their flag on Castle Rock. The
sopho-mores made for it and the fresh
men ran with It. At 5 p. m. the fresh
men got together and marched up the
main street. In the center of the town
they burned the sophomores' Hag. The
sophomores then formed in the street
and marched to the school campus,
where they met the freshmen in a
rough and tumble light, which lasted
fear an hour and a half.
Dr. J. P. Kelley, president of the
board of trustees, brought the fight to
a close lw threats of expulsion.
who i died in 1576. She read in a
newspaper that Mrs. Mead, an old wo
man now an inmate of the Hackney
Workhouse, in London, had claimed a
share in the Blake millions as Mrs.
Blake's cousin. From this story the
German woman learned tnat her name
is the same as the maiden name of the
general's widow, and this suggested to
her that she might be a relation, and.
therefore, entitled to a share in the
property.
CONSULTS CLAIRVOYANT.
Thereupon she consulted a clairvoy
ant. The oracle told her that she was
a relation and was undoubtedly entl
! tied to a share of the Blake inheritance
j now held by the crown. There is noth
ing startling in that. Clairvoyants gen
erally tell their clients things that will
make them think they are getting their
i moneys worth. But this one went fur
j ther than that. As proof of her occult
i power she made a sketch of the ward
jof the Hackney Workhouse in which
I Mrs. Mead is confined. And she told
'< the namesake of General Blake's
j widow that if it didn't turn out correct
I she would return her fee and renounce
! clairvoyance. The master of the work
| house has pronounced a copy of the
i drawing which has been sent him an
! accurate one of Mrs. Mead's ward. It
1 was accepted by the German woman
! as conclusive proof that all the clair
j voyant had told her was true. She has
| engaged a lawyer to hunt up records
' and push her claim.
CODY FAILS
TO OBTAIN
A DIVORCE
Wyoming Judge, in Deciding
Famous Case, Rebukes
"Buffalo Bill" for Attempt
ing to Cast Aside His Wife
DECLARES CHARGES
TO HAVE BEEN FALSE
Court Says Former Scout
Repaid Devotion by Heap
ing Cruelties and Indigni
ties Upon His Helpmate
SHERIDAN. Wyo., March 23. â The
District Court here to-day refused the
petition of Colonel William F. Cody
( "Buffalo Bill") for a divorce.
A decision in the case was not ex
pected before to-morrow at the earliest,
but the courtroom was filled with resi
dents of Sheridan and the surround
ing country when it was given. After
the reading of depositions was finished
to-day the attorneys for both sides an
nounced that they would submit the
case without argument. After a short
iecess Judge H. H. Scott asked the at
torneys for the defendant to amend
their answer in the case by striking
out those sections which de.alt with
charges against Bessie Isbell, Cody's
conduct in Chicago and his early ex
cesses at Fort McPherson. When this
was done the court found entirely in
favor of the defendant, Mrs. Louisa
Cody.
Judge Scott delivered an opinion of
considerable length, reviewing the al
legations and evidence and giving his
conclusions. Said he:
The law of the State does not make in
compatibility a ground for divorce, but It does
read that extreme cruelty, rendering the con
dition of either party to the marriage contract
Intolerable, Is sufficient ground to allow the
granting of a divorce.
The first cause of action in this case is the
charts* of poisoning; on December 2G. 1900, or
some time prior thereto. Ttie evidence wholly
falls to support this issue, but shows the de
fendant was trying to rescue the plaintiff from
a stale of intoxication and administered, not
poison, but rem-Â»dies which she deemed bene
ficial to Mm. Mis inability to speak on this
occasion did not come from these remedies,
but came irom his excessive use of Intoxicating
liquors at the banquet board and was as
humiliating: to the defendant as to the plain
tiff.
The unhappltKss caused by the actions of
the plaintiff Is shown by the letter of thalr
daugiiter, Arta Thorpe, whose beautiful char
acter shone out from her unhappy home in
the words of her letter written Just before her
d^ath:
'â Oh. papa, why did you do it? My heart
is ium broken over It. Oh, why did you
do it?"
Judge Scott also found that the
charge of unbecoming actions on the
part of the defendant toward the
colonel's guests was not proven; that
there was no evidence that . she had
ever threatened her husband's life, and
that when attending the funeral of her
daughter Arta at Rochester, N. V., in
February, 1904, she offered a perma
nent reconciliation and no answer ever

WILL RETREAT
BEYOND HARBIN
Linevitch Not to Tarry Until He Has
Penetrated Far Into the In
terior of Siberia.
Amur Prcv.nces Will Be Lost to Czar Nicholas
PETERSI ' Tn *
pCMfbflity that if the- srmy
- line
r at ("hunt hiatsu it
may tx? compelled to retreat not only
to Harbin, but also farther westward
ajcr.g the railroad, abandoning to the
Japanese Northern Manchuria and the
Russian maritime Amur provinces as
well, is the latest startling news from
the front.
The strategic weakness of General
L!r.evi;.ch's petition as he falls back
northward is made clear by Gunshu
dispatches, in which it is pointed out
that unless Cbunchiatsu and the Sun
g*ri lines, a scant hundred miles below
Harbin, can be held, it will be difficult
to maintain a position before Harbin,
where, with the front of the army par
alleling the railroad, the practicability
of a turning movement to completely
sever communications and isolate the
army 6000 miles from home is too seri
ous for Russian consideration. In view
of this possibility the dispatch alluded
to suggests the advisability of immedi
ately providing Vladivostok with war
munitions and supplies for a two years'
siege. The correspondent estimates the
number of reinforcements needed to
give General Linevitch the requisite su
periority in force at 200,000.
That such a dispatch should have
been permitted to pass the censor at
th* front Is significant, and if General
Unevitch hae communicated a similar
estimate of the situation direct to Em
peror Nicholas it may account for his
majesty's increased disposition to listen
to peace counseis and open negotiations
before the Japanese establish them
selves en Russian soil. With Manchuria
entirely abandoned to the Japanese and
Vladivostok left as Russia's solitary
. sentinel on the Pacific, it is realized
that Russia will be practically at
Japan's mercy in the matter of peace
It can now be definitely stated that
-the decision to appoint Grand Duke
Nicholas Nicolaievitch to the supreme
command in the Far East was recon
sidered because the outlook at the front
did not warrant the risk of compromis
ing Ihe prestige of a member of the
Imperial family.
Military authorities here believe that
unless General Linevitch is sure of his
ability to hold the lower Sungari line
he v ill risk his whole army if he forti
fies and cone -ntrates there, as, if he
should be defeated, his line of retreat
lies on two sides of â  triangle, the third
side of which is open to the enemy's
advance.
At the general staff the view that
General Linevitch may be compelled to
abandon Harbin and retire toward
Lake Baikal, leaving Vladivostok to its
fate, is regarded as unwarranted by
anything that is officially known there.
It being pointed out that Field Marshal
Oyama will have a long and laborious
task to bring up an army of 300,000 or
400,000 men.
Meanwhile. Russian reinforcements
are arriving at Harbin at the rate of
1200 men a day.

BETTER TERMS FOR JAPAN.
AmTfcan Syndicate Takes One-Half
of the New Loan.
NEW York, Marrh 23.âNegotia
tions for a Japanese loan of $150,
000.000 have been successfully con
cluded in London. Kuhn, Loeb & Co.
of this city, who will share in the loan,
made the announcement to-day. The
loan will bear interest at 4^j per cent
and will be secured by a first mortgage
on the tobacco monopoly. One-half of
the entire loan will be taken in this
country. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. will man
age an American syndicate, with the
â¢dnce of the National City Bank
and the National Bank of Commerce.
The term of maturity of the neÂ»v loan
has not yet been disclosed, nor has the
subscription price, but it is understood
that Japan has been given better terms
than in the previous two loans.

WIDE TURNING MOVEMENT.
Japanese Operating on Both Sides of

GUNSHU PASS. Manchuria. March
23. â The Japanese are following the
Russian rear guard, which is moving
northward from Santoupu at the rate
of eight and a half miles a day. On
both flanks the Japanese are operat
ing a wide turning movement, but the
strength of the flanking forces has
not been definitely ascertained.
It is doubtful whether General
Linevitrh will make a stand before he
rear-hep the Sungari River and
< hantchiatu. Unless he is able to hold
thÂ«Â» line of the river the Russian posi
tion will be so weak strategically that
he may be compelled to retire back
of Harbin into Siberia.
Two hundred thousand reinforce

to make it possible for the Russians
to meet the Japanese on anything like
even terms.

KUTNO, Russian Poland, March 23.â
Ten peasants were killed and fifty were
wounded at Lamenta on March 21 by
infantry sent to quell disturbances. A
crowd of peasants from BenJgnowa pro
ceeded to Lamenta to induce the farm
laborers to strike and rioting occurred.
The Chief of Police, with a company
of soldiers, went to the scene and the
troops fired two volleys at the peas
ants, killing two and wounding fifty.
The latter were brought in carts to
the hospital, where seven men and one
woman eubsequently died. Eleven oth
ers are dying.
WARSAW, March 23.â The shooting
of peasants at Lamenta has aroused
intense excitement in the whole dis
trict. The action of the authorities is
angrily criticized and a deputation of
residents of Kutno is proceeding to
Warsaw to lay complaints before the
Governor General. *
The troubles began a week ago, when
the mobilization of horses was ordered.
The peasants refused to comply and on
March 21 about 150 peasants gathered
on the road near Lamenta. The Chief
of Police at Kutno arrived on the
scene with a company of infantry and
ordered the crowd to disperse. The
peasants refused to obey and the Chief
of Police then ordered the soldiers to
fire. The peasants, not understanding
Russian, remained in the road until
the soldiers aimed. Then they broke
and ran. The troops fired three vol
leys at the fleeing crowd, and fifty
peasants fell, two of them dead. All
the wounded were shot in the back.
It is said that the Chief of Police
refused to allow the wounded to be re
nioved. and that he finally ordered
them to be taken to Kutno. six hours'
journey, in peasants' carts, with the
result that, owing to the lack of medi
cal attendance, eight of the woundM
died while on their way to Kutno, and
the directors report that nine others
are in a hopeless condition.
Fearing a demonstration at the fu
neral of the victims, the Chief of Po
lice requested the priests to bury them
during the night. This the priests re
fused to do, and the funerals occurred
this morning at the cemetery at Kutno.
ThÂ«Â» services were attended by an im
mense concourse of people and the cof
fins were hidden beneath masses of
flowers

SOUTHBOUND OVERLAND
TRAIN NEARLY WRECKED
Unknown Miscreants Place a Bridge
Timber Eight Inches Square
Across the Rails.
ALBANY. Or.. March 23. â When
the southbound overland train on the
Southern Pacific reached here about
midnight Wednesday a piece of timber
was found wedged under the pilot. It
was thought at the time that the piece
of timber had fallen on the track ac
cidentally. Investigation to-day show
ed that a few blocks north from the
station, where a street crosses the
track, a bridge timber eight inches
square had been placed across the
track against the end of the guard rail,
with the evident intention of wrecking
the train. The only thing that saved a
wreck was the fact that the bridge
timber was old and rotten and when
the engine struck the timber the guard
rail cut through the rotten wood, al
lowing it to slide along in front of
the engine until a portion of it became
wedged under the pilot. Several other
pieces of bridge timber were found ly
ing across the track. The matter is
being investigated and several sus
picious characters are under surveil
lance.

SACRAMENT*. ... fell 28.â The Sac
ramento Valley Development Associa
tion has Just issued the following bul
letin relative to the great Sacramento
Valley irrigation project:
4< The most important event of the
present year in the Sacramento Valley
will be the visit of the Senate and
House irrigation committees of the
National Congress. The gentlemen
composing these committees will make
a tour of the irrigable portions of the
United States and will come here for
the purpose of Investigating what 19
known as the great Sacramento Valley
irrigation project. The party will ar
rive in June and the Sacramento Val
ley Development Association is al
ready making plans to show them the
Sacramento Valley and the striking
features of the irrigation scheme. The
California promotion committee is also
interested in the proposed visit and
will prepare an itinerary for the party
while in this State. â¢
"The Sacramento Valley irrigation
project is one of the most stupendous
irrigation enterprises ever conceived by
man. It contemplates the ultimate
control of all the waters of the Sacra
mento and San Joaquln Valleys
through the construction of a great
syslem of canals completely encircling
the! great interior basin of the State,
mingling the waters of the many
streams flowing into the valley and
eradicating all inequalities of water
supply, as the great system now under
construction in the Valley of the Po
in Northern Italy is calculated to dis
tribute equably the waters of numer
ous streams there.
"The beginning of this great scheme
is at Iron Canyon on the Sacramento
River above Red Bluff, where it is pro
posed to build a great dam from whirh
the water will be diverted first to the
right bank, ultimately to both banks.
The height of this dam will not be de
termined until the surveys are further
advanced, but it is assumed that its
crest will be about 300 feet above sea
level. Under the plans proposed the
west side of the Sacramento Valley is
to be covered first by a great canal ex
tending along the foothills of the Coast
Range from Iron Canyon to Suisun
Bay.
SURVEYS BEING MADE.
"The streams which flow from the
Sierras are considered sufficient to
water the east side of this valley, but
it is probable that the east side sys
tem, when the plans are complete, will
also, be connected witTy the Iron Can
yon dam in order to remove the neces
sity of dependence upon local water
supply.
"Plane for this vast undertaking are
still in the making. No man knows to
day what may be accomplished. Elab
orate surveys are being conducted by
the National Government and the
State of California, working jointly,
and when these are complete it will
be possible to determine what should
be and what may be done. At the
present time the west side of the Sac
ramento Valley is under Investigation
and undoubtedly the first construction
work, should the Government under
take it, will be the Iron Canyon dam
and the west side canal.
'The work began two years ago when
the Legislature made an appropriation
to be use<l in connection with an eoual
sum to be appropriated by the National
Government to carry on the work here
and elsewhere in this State under the
direction of the National Interior and
Agricultural Departments. An addi
tional appropriation of $76,000 has been
made this year for the State's share
of the expense of continuing the work
during the next two years.
"The United States Geological Survey
is conducting the topographic and
hydrographic surveys. The Depart
ment of Agriculture investigates the
land to he irrigated.
"The topographic survey Is under the
direction of R. B. Marshall, whose of
flce is in the Government building in
Sacramento. Here visitors see work
progressing on maps which show all
the topographic features of the terri
tory covered, maps which tell the ex
perienced engineer all he must know

The field work is suspended at the
present time, but a force of fifty or
sixty men will soon be put in the field.
CONGRESS
CONGRESS IS INTERESTED.
"This work has been >;oiiiÂ« on for
tÂ«u years. The west side of the val
ley has been covered as tar down as
Cohisa* Maps of the area between
Coming and Red Bluff have already
been published on a scale of one inch
to the mile with ten foot contour in
tervals. Maps from Corning south will
be published on a scale of two inches
to the mile with five foot contour in
tervals showing all roads, houses and
main ditches west of the Sacramento
River, to an elevation of 300 feet above
si-a level. It is expected that about
two years more \\i{\ be required to
complete the surveys west of the
Sacramento River to Suisun Bay.
"The hydrographic work is in charge
of J. B. Lippincott, whose office is in
Los Angeles. Under his direction
streams are being gauged, the quantity
and quality of the water in each de
termined. Reservoir sites are beine
selected and their capacity determined
and other valuable data collected.
What the Government may do to
ward the actual construction of the
vast systems contemplated is yet to
be seen. The visit of the Congression
al Irrigation Committees has a direct
bearing upon this matter and it is es
sential that they be favorably im
pressed. That Congress is, interested
in the matter is evidenced by the visit
of the members and by the work now
being done. Leading Government en
gineers have declared this to be the
greatest irrigable field in the United
States. Engineer Lippincott is known
to be enthusiastic regarding the possi
bilities of the Iron Canyon project, R.
B. Marshall, topographer, in charge of
the topographic surveys, not less so.
LAW MAY BE MODIFIED.
"The reclamation service created by
act of Congress known as the New
lands act has been interested in this
enterprise and will await with interest
the report of the Congressional com
mittees. While the Newlands act in
its present form does not admit of the
expenditure of the irrigation funds ex
cept where private ownership of land
is confined to tracts not exceeding 160
acres each it is not unreasonable to
hope that some modification of its pro
visions may be secured or a special act
created to admit of the construction by
the Government of this system. Sub
division and sale of large tracts which
is now proceeding quf** satisfactorily
in the Sacramento Valley may remove
this difficulty much more rapidly than
is now anticipated by the majority of
the people,.
"The surveys are of incalculable value
regardless of what the Government
may do about construction. The waters
of the Sacramento River Valley region
must be applied to the land and the
first step must be the surveys. With
these provided the expense of planning
the system will be comparatively slight
and the proposition will be too good to
be overlooked.
â¢'The interests of the land owners will
be best served by the construction of
these canals through co-operation with
the Government. Every effort should
be made to interest Congress and the
departments and the proposed visit of
th^ fongresslonal committees is an op
portunity of very great value and im
portance.
"The Sacramento Valley Develop
ment Association has been interested in
this work from the beginning. With
lather organized bodies of the State,
notably the Water and Forest Associa
tion, it was instrumental in securing
the State legislation under which the
I work was begun.
"During the last session of Congress
the association was in communication
with Congressman Theodore A. Bell,
who was a member of the Irrigation
Committee of the House and deeply in
terested in this matter.
INTEREST IS AROUSED.
"At the last meeting of the executive
committee it was decided to invite Mr.
Bell to make a trip over the territory
as a guest of the association In order
that, in the light of his experience as
a member of the Irrigation Committee,
when the plans for the visit were made,
he may be able to make recommenda
tions that will enable the association
to provide the information most de
sired. Mr. Bell writes that he has been
asked by the reclamation service to
take care of the party while in the
Sacramento Valley, and that he will be
glad to avail himself of the offer of the
association to co-operate with him.
"It is hoped that every California
Congressman and Senator may be in
duced to accompany the Congressional
Committees through this valley. Hon.
D. E. McKinlay, who succeeds Mr. Bell,
will be asked to personally assist in
interesting California members in the
matter, and that he will do so goes
without saying.

MAY KEEP SHIPS
ON ETEN KEEL
BERLIN, March 23.â The Hambure-
American line is building a new steam
er at the Vulcan works at Stettin which
will be fitted with an invention of Otto
Shyk. an engineer of Hamburg:, which
it is expected will reduce the rolline
of vessels at sea to a minimum. It
consists of a massive balance wheel
mounted in such a manner as to
counteract the shifting of the center
of gravity of the ship.
The invention hitherto has been
tested only in connection with models,
but the Hamburg-American officials
are so convinced of its utility that they
are advancing money and loaning a
I for a trial, which will take place
in June or July. Naval engineers re
paid tru invention as a great benefit to
wars-hips as it adds to the stability of
grun platforms.

TEAR SHEDDING
LOSES POTENCY
William H. Benson Divorces
Woman Who Said She Mar
ried Him for "Good Thing"
GRAHAM UPSETS HOPES
Demands Presence in Court
of Henry V. Xess and
Proves Collusion Exists
Mrs. Theresa Foster, landlady, told
a story in Judge Hunt's court yester
day that ended the career of Mrs.
Myrtle M. Benson as the wife of Wil
liam H. Benson, stationer at 430 Sut
ter street. Benson was granted a de
cree of divorce c-n the ground of ex
treme cruelty after the landlady had
concluded her story and Benson had
corroborated It.
Mrs. Foster testified that Mrs. Ben
son had stated that her husband was a
"good thing," that she intended to be
his wife in name only and keep her
self thoroughly in fashion, because she
knew that all she had to do to get any
thing she wanted out of her husband
was to shed a few tears. Through this
process of tear shedding she said she
had so lacerated her husband's heart
that he bought her six new hats In an
equal r.umber of weeks.
Mrs. Foster, at whose place the Ben
sons resided, also testified that Mrs.
Benson and another married woman
entertained several Japanese men in
their rooms, but when it was explained
to the Japanese by Mrs. Foster that
they were not doing right, that the
women were married and should not
enjoy the company of gentlemen other
than their husbands, the Japanese
apologized profusely, stated that they
had been misinformed by the women
in question and withdrew, returning no
more.
WEDDING NIGHT WANDERINGS.
Benson testified that on their wed
ding night his wife insisted on going
out for a good time, this by herself.
The result was that he did not see her
until the next day. Her habit of going
out on pleasure expeditions by herself
grew upon her, he said, as time passed,
and in answer to his protestations she
only laughed at him and told him that
she had only married him because he
was a "good thing," and she intended
to use him as such. This was enough
for the court, and the decree prayed
for was granted without delay.
Decress of divorce were also granted
yesterday to Lucinda D. Buchtel from
John A. Buchtel for desertion; John W.
Council from Mabel A. Council for
desertion; August H. Helntz from An
nie D. Heintz for intemperance; Maude
Lawson from James A. Lawson for
desertion; Lottie M. Gabriel from Ern
est C. Gabriel for extreme cruelty and
failure to provide, and Mary E. Green
from George H. Green for extreme
cruelty.
Judge Graham's new rule requiring
the presence in court of all defendants
In divorce cases resulted sadly for An
nie E. Xess yesterday. She sued Henry
V. Ness for divorce. He did not an
swer the complaint and a default was
entered against him. Judge Graham
refused to hear the caK,, however, un
less the defendant were present, and a
subpena was issued for him. After
Mrs. Ness had put in her case he was
put on the stand and forced to admit
that there was collusion between them;
that they had agreed to disagree for no
real reason. Judge Graham forthwith
dismissed the suit and denied Mrs.
Ness' application for divorce. This new
rul^ promises to cut off collusion cases,
which, in late years, have occupied
much of the time of courts.
SEVERAL ASK DIVORCE.
Vida Adelaide Phillips asks for a di
vorce from Eugene J. Phillips for ex
treme cruelty. Mrs. Phillips alleges
that Phillips has beaten and choked her
on several occasions. Julia Neer com
plains that Stewart S. Neer has treat
ed her cruelly, and she asks for a di
vorce from him on that ground. Ex
treme cruelty is also the cause of ac
tion in the suit, filed by Nellie Lewis
Wise against Henry E. Wise for di
vorce. Laura A. Tolles sues William
S. Tolles for divorce, alleging deser
tion.
Edward W. Treadwell has sued
Sophia M. Treadwell for divorce, al
leging cruelty. Marguerite Hatting
complains that Christian D. Hatting
has failed to provide her with the com
mon necessaries of life, and she sues
for dix'orce on the ground. Clara Rich
man Campbell asks for a divorce from
Joseph Campbell Jr. on the grounds
of intemperance and cruelty. She com
plains that not only does he frequently
appear before her friends in an intoxi
cated condition, greatly to her humilia
tion, but that he has acquired the habit
of pawning her jewels to obtain funds
with which to gamble.
LABOR MEN RKCEIVE
WORD FROM SENATORS
Flint and I'crklns Say They Will In
vestigate the Japanese Immigra
tion CÂ»Â»Â«estlors.
The Labor Council yesterday re
ceived replies from United States Sen
ators Perkins and Flint stating that
the matter of Japanese immigration
would be thoroughly investigated" in
Washington. The labor organizations
of the State are making strenuous ef
forts to prevent Japanese coming to
this country and hope to receive aid
from California's representatives in
the upper house.
President McCarthy of the Building
Trades Council returned from a busi
ness trip in the south. He reports la
bor unions in a flourishing condition
there and says there is no trouble.
The difficulty between the employes
of the glnss works of the city and
their employers has been settled ac
cording to the trades regulations and
a strike has been averted. Both sides
made 1 concessions.
INTEND TO ESTABLISH
A COFFEE CL.UB HOUSE
Members of the Christian Endeavor
interested in the opening of a coffee
club house in this city met at the
First Baptist Church last night and
discussed the project at length. The
idea of the people who propose to start
the coffee club house is not to establish
an Imitation saloon or restaurant, but
rather to make a social center, where
all sorts of people can meet and enjoy
a social chat. The meeting was fol
lowed by a dinner.
There is already a coffee club at
San Jose and there are two at Los
Angeles. All three of these are doing
well and members of the Christian En
deavor are certain that one would
flourish in San Francisco. On May
4 the Christian Endeavor rally, repre
senting 2000 young people, will be held
in the interests of the coffee club.

Iject being: "Creative Education

to an audience that almost completely
filled the great ampitheater. The
ragged outlirfcs of the structure were
Ful arrangement of
greenery, while blue and gold pennons
Â» of the university fluttered in profusion
from the sides and top row of the thea
ter's geats. The stage of the theater
â¢was filled with professors, regents, ]
alumni and guests. The university or- |
chestra rendered music from a stand
in the center of the lower dais and the '
"rooters" contributed their quota from
the center section of the theater. " j
PROCESSION MOVES.
The procession, made up "of the fac- :
i tilty members, gowned and wearing the |
traditional trencher cap. moved from ,
the university library building at 2:30 j
o'clock. Captain J. T. Nance, military
instructor, supervised its formation and
movement. It wound slowly past North
Hall, and then up to the theater where
the formal exercises were to be con
ducted. The alumni present led the
procession to the gate of the theater,
followed by regents, faculty members,
guests and students, with President
"Wheeler and Professor Van Dyke the i
last figures in the line. At the gate the ;
â  marchers reversed positions. President
Wheeler and Professor Van Dyke en- '
tering first, with the others in order. '
Rev. Samuel Hopkins Willey deliv
ered the invocation, and President
Wheeler then spoke briefly of the sig-
niticaiK c of the occasion, referring to
â  the loss Stanford University hag sus
. tamed in the death of its two founders.
He characterized Mrs. Stanford as a
heroine, whose steadfastness and pa
tience would not.be known to all until
in after yearn the full story of her life
was told.
The alumni chorus, garmented in cap
and gown, sang at this juncture, the
chorus including the following men:

The address of the alumni was de
livered by Alexander Grimes Eells,
president of the Alumni Association.
He spoke feelingly of the ties that bind
alumni to their alma mater, and then
described the effect that college ideals
have upon the lives of those who main
tain them after leaving school. He an
nounced, incidentally, that all the
alumni organizations of the university
are to be made a compact organization
In a very little while.
MAXY GUTS.
Before introducing Professor. Van
Dyke as the speaker of the day. Presi
dent Wheeler read a list of the bene
factions which the university has re
ceived during the last year, most of
vhich have hitherto been made public.
He said Mrs. Hearst's contributions
have aggregated about $150,000. and
cited gifts of John D. Spreckels, who
has provided for the transfer of a
splendid collection of German books to
the university library: gifts of W. EL
Crocker, who has arranged for an ex- \
pedition to Spain to observe the total
eclipse of the sun In August: essay
prizes provided by Regent Taussig and
Charles Butters. Mr. Butters has Just I
promised to give a prize for an essay '
each year, dealing with the Spanish- I
American life of the continent, the
6ubject this year to be "The -part that
the United States has played in the de
velopment of Spanish- American for-- ;
eign eofninercf." The" committee to i
award this prize has been appointed
0 consisting of Professors Moses. Miller
and Plehn.
"I am tempted at this .time." con
cluded President Wheeler, "to violate
a confidence and inform you that Mr.
Hearst has recently told me of his in
tention to soon complete the work of
building this Greek theater, covering
these rough seat* with marble and
otherwise making it a finished prod
uct. " Cheers followed this announce
ment.
Professor Van Dyke, upon being in
â¢ troduced by President Wheeler, said he
brought a cordial greeting from "old
Princeton" 'to California, and ex
pressed his own hope that the future
of the University of California might
be glorious beyond expectations or
dreams. He then spoke in part as fol
lows:
In that admirable book. The American Com
monwealth, by Mr. James Brief, the chapter
.in coilrges and universities comes Immediately
after the chapter on Wall str-jet. There Is a
singular contrast between them, for â while the
<m* r<>preÂ«^sts, â  the nearest approach -to per
slnjism in an uncommonly cheerful book tli
uiher marks the highest note of optimism to

of . speculation, constitutions I excitability, and
hif; h â¢â¢orvou* tension neem to have passed Into
the fiber of the American people; but the
chapter on colleges and universities end* with
the hopeful observation that: "While of all
the institutions of the country they are those
of which the Americans speak most modestly.
and Indeed deprecatlnsly. they are those which
eecm to be at this moment making the swift
est progress and which have the brightest

habit of modest and deprecating speech, we
have -a faint suspicion that the author's ex
perience of academic anniversaries â  may have

PROFESSOR HENRY VAN DYKE, D.D., LL.D., OF PRINCETON. DELIVERING THE CHARTER DAY ADDRESS AT THE
T NIYETRSITY OF CALIFORNIA AN IMMENSE AT DIENCE GATHERED IN THE BIG AMPHITHEATER TO HE4R HIS
ADDRESS ON "CREATIVE EDT'CATION IN A DEMOCRACY."
tion in a democracy â the decorative ideal. thÂ«
marketable ideal, or the creative ideal?
i .hall speak of the decorative Ideal first
because, strangely enough, it Is likely to take
precedence in order of time and certainly, it
is pre-eminent In worthlessness. Barbarous
rtiocs prefer ornament to decency and comfort
in dress. It is a desire to have something in
the way of Intellectual or social adornment
which seems to have been the earliest concep
tli->n of education. This nose-ring conception
not inly rejects and abhors the useful, but
exalts the useless chiefly because it is Use like
ly to be common. In this crop of the decora-^
the :hiK->l Â«if culture we find those phenomena
of intellectual life â esthetictsm and eymbil
ism and decadentism and the like. .Their mark
Is eccentricity. Their favorite poet must be
one who is cavaire to the vulgar. They must
believe that Homer and Dante and Milton and
the Bible have beer, very much overrated and
cart-fully ruarded, as Oscar Wilde did In the
pretence of the ocean from giving way to
sentiments of vulstar admiration. Views of
hlht"ry must depreciate familiar heroes and
whitewash extraordinary villains. This dec
orative ideal of education is a by product in
the spiritual fermentation of a democracy.
At the opposite extreme of the decorative
ideal liÂ°? the marketable ideal of education.
It aims simply to bring out a man's natural
abilities to get the largest return In money for
his work. I Nothing is of value according to
this ideal which is not of direct utility in
business or a profession. This marketable
ideal can be seen In some of the higher insti
tutions of learning, where boys .-ire to be culti
vated, not as men. but as journalists, survey
ors, chemists, lawyers, â¢ physicians, painters,
musician*, manufacturers, mining engineers,
sellers of wet and dry goods, bankers, account,
ants and what not. We have Institutes of
everything, from stenography to farriery. â  . It
remains only to add a few more, an academy
of mesmerism and college of mind healing and
a chiropodist university, to round the encyclo
pedlae according to the commercial Ideal. I
The true ideal of education In a democracy
is the creative Ideal, a proceed of development.
Its aim is the production of something which
did not exist before. TTie educated man is a
new man. It is not merely that he kr.nwa
mar*, that he can do more â there Is something
In him which was not there when his edu;a
l!^n began.
OBJECTS OF EDUCATION.
This, it seems to me, is the real object of
rdiu-Htlnn. Not merely to decorate a man
with rare accomplishments; not merely to
train him for a- fixed function in the vast
mechanism of industry and commerce, but to
create out of the raw stuff that Ip hidden in
the boy a finer, stronger, broader, nobler typÂ«
of man. I am not dealing In glittering gener
alities.
The man who is honored with an invitation
to speak here owes It to himself and to his
audience to have a distinct Idea at the center
of his address. There i? such an Idea here. It
has four definite marks and qualities â the
to see clearly, the power to imagine
vividly, the power to think independently and
the power to will nobly. If a man has these
four poT'#Â» clear sight, quick imagination,
sound retfson and right, strong will â I call him
an â¢ Jucatrd man.
The power to use the senses to their full
capacity does not come by nature. It la a
habit, the result of Instruction, applied to the
opening of blind eyes and the unsealing of
deaf ears. All life must contribute to this in
struction.
But there is another world of Inward vision,
and the key to It is the imagination. Imag
ination Is more than a pleasant fountain. It
Is a fertilizing stream, it is the mark of ge
nius. Nothing jrreat has ever been discovered
<.r invented wlthoi t the aid of Imagination.
The chief instrument in the creative culture
nf imagination is literature. TTie object of lit
erary culture i? very simple. It is to teach a
man to distinguish the best books and to en
able hint to read them with inward vision.
We are trying hard to increase the number
of people who can write with ease, while the
race of people who can read with Imagination
is left to thÂ« care of chance. I wish that we
might reverse thÂ« process.
The design of education is not accomplished
unless man passes beyond the power of seeing
things as they are. and beyond the power of
Interpreting and appreciating the thought? of
other men ir.to the power of thinking for him
self. To be able to ask, "Why," and to dis
cover what it means to say "Because" â that
is the flnesi result of education.
CULTURE DEFINED.
"To Know the best that has been thought
and said in the world" is what Matthew Ar
nold calls culture. It Is an excellent attain
ment. But there Is a step beyond it that leads
from culture into manhood That step is taken
when the student, knowing something of the
best that other men have thought and said
begins to think his own thoughts clearly
through and to put them in his own words.
But one more aim is included In the creative
ideal of education, and that is its effect upon
thÂ« wm. The power to nee clearly to Imag
ine widely, to think independently will cer
tainly be wasted, or at lean will be shut up
In the Individual and kept for hit own selfish
delight, when the power to wMI nobly comes
to call the man Into action and give him with
all his education to the service of the world
An educated man is helpless until he Is
emancipated. An emancipated roan Is aim
less until he is consecrated. Consecration is
âºimply concentration plus a sense of duty
What we need at present is not new" col
lege* with a power of conferring degrees but
more power in thÂ« existing colleges to make
men. To this end let them have a richer
endowment, a fuller equipment, but, above all
a revlral of the creative ideal. And let every
thing be done to brine together the high

KNOW LAND BACK
FROM CAPITAL
Congressman Arrives Home
From Washington and Re
lates His Experiences
ALAMEDA. March 23.â Congressman
Joseph R. Knowland of the Third Dis
trict is home from Washington, hav
ing arrived last evening from South
ern California, where as chairman of
the Board of Grand Trustees of Na
tive Sons he officially visited a number
of parlors of the fraternity. Mr. Know
land left Washington on the 7th of this
month and in company with Mrs.
Knowland, who went to the national
capital to witness the inauguration of
President Roosevelt, traveled by way
of New Orleans to Los Angeles. There
Mrs. Knowland left her husband and
came on to Alameda, reaching here
last Thursday.
Concerning his experiences in his
first session of Congress, the youngest
representative ever sent to the na
tional halls of lefcislation from Califor
nia said:
The two matter* that occupied the greater
part of my attention in Washington were thÂ«
securing of an appropriation of $175,000 to
properly equip the Mare Island Navy Yard Â«o
that one of the Government colliers to cost $1,
223.000 and which was provided for in the last
general naval bill could be constructed there,
and the obtaining of an appropriation of $360,
000 for the Improvement of Oakland harbor.
1 was successful In both, much to my gratifi
cation, as I feel that two of the most Im
portant projects in my district fared well, con
sidering the opposition that had to be met and
overcome. It was necessary for me to move
an amendment to the general naval bill In or
der to get the appropriation of J175.000. I
spoke five minutes and when the amendment
carried by a vote of I'M) to 73, Mr. Dolllver,
one of tne veterans of the house, said to me :
'Young man. your talk cost the United States
Just $3.Y00t) a minute. You exercised magnifi
cent economical Judgment in cutting It short
where you did."
I saw Secretary Metcalf often. He is one of
the most industrious members of the Cabinet,
and there is no one in the President's official
household closer to him than Metcalf. One
day I observed President Roosevelt enter a
committee room where Secretary Metcalf wu
and in his rugged and hearty manner the
President slapped the Secretary on the back
and said: "Vie, how is your health?"
While I always knew that Senator Perkins
was one of the most valuable representatives
of California at Washington, I never fully
appreciated his power until I worked with him
there. He is on seven important committees
and when he goes after anything for Califor
nia he !s unfailingly successful In his efforts.
I was present when Senator Frank Flint
took the oath of office. During the short
period that he was at Washington his winning
personality and ability made him many friends.

IDENTIFIES
BUGGY USED
BY ROBBERS
Sheriff Barnet Locates the
Vehicle W r hich Stege High
waymen Employed When
Leaving Scene of Hold-Up
CLEW CONSIDERED
VERY IMPORTANT
Man Who Gives His Name as
Eussell Hires Conveyance
From Stableman Who Says
Fellow Acted Suspiciously
OAKLAND, March 23. â Sheriff Bar
net has found the missing horse and
buggy which were used by the second
robber in the flight Monday morning
from the scene of the Stege cross
ing hold-up, when John E. Daly and
Frank K. Roche were relieved of
$10,000 in transit from the Central
Bank to the Bank of Richmond. Daly
has identified the horse and buggy,
which were located to-night in Aber
nethy Bros.' stable, 1318 San Pablo
avenue. This rig is the one that Daly
noticed standing hitched to a fence
on Railroad avenue, east of the cut,
as he started to drive across the rail
road tracks.
Edward Abernethy, one of the pro
prietors of the stable, rented the
horse and buggy Sunday night to a
man who gave the name of G. Russell,
who answers the description of the
second highwayman. He said he de
sired to go to Berkeley Monday morn
ing to look at some real estate. The
bargain was made and Russell paid
$1 50 for the use of the rig. Monday
morning at 6:45 o'clock Russell took
out the team. Between 11 and 12
o'clock that morning he returned with
it. It was covered with mud and the
horse showed unmistakable signs of
having been driven hard.
WHIP IS A CLEW.
The team was returned with the
whip broken, another mark of identi
fication. Several persons on the San
Pablo road who noticed the second
rig driving in Monday morning re
marked that the horse was being hard
pressed and the driver was using a
broken whip.
The horse known as "Fox " is a fair
sized chestnut sorrel. The buggy is of
piano-box type, red running gear, red
shafts and a noticeably peculiar high
back seat. Daly from the outset con
tended that the horse was a sc/rrel and
was hitched to such an appearing bug
gy as that he saw to-night at Aber
nethy's stable. His practiced eye on
horse-flesh and vehiclesâ for Daly is a
stableman of many years' experience â
detected little peculiarities that con
vinced him almost positively that here
was the missing rig.
Miss Mabel Perry, who saw the hold
up through field glasses, said the sec
ond buggy that drove away behind the
stolen Daly rig after the robbery was
c-f the piano-box style. She was posi
tive on that point. That the second
rig was hitched to a sorrel horse has
been declared by several persons who
saw it on the San Pablo road.
FURTHER IDENTIFICATION.
Daly and Sheriff Barnet feel further
satisfied they are on the right track
because the description of. Russell so
elosejy fits that ft the short, stout rob
ber who covered Roche with a pistol,
and was seen by Mi&s Perry when he
slid down the railroad embankment and
went toward the spot where Daly had
seen the buggy standing.
Russell wore a cap Monday morning
when he left Abernethy's stable. The
second robber, according to those who
saw him driving in town, wore a cap.
When I^aly was asked to look at the
horses In Abemethy's stable stalls, he
said he would know the animal as soon
as the blanket was pulled from it, and
he did.
"I'd almost stake my life on it, " de
clared Daly, as he examined the sorrel.
"That horse and the one I saw stand
ing on the avenue are identical. I am
practically sure of it."
Daly did not see the buggy when he
first stepped into the barn, but in a few
minutes his eye caught the identical
rig and he exclaimed:
"That must be the one."
Sheriff Barnet, to make sure of his
ground, will send for people who saw
the rig Monday, in order to Have them
identify if If possible.
Abernethy described Russell as un
der average height, stout and stocky,
with a dark muÃtache, otherwise
smooth shaven. He waa between 40
and 50 years old. On the right side of
his face, under the eye. was a blemish
of some kind, the exact nature of which
Abernethy was not sure. The stable
man said Russell wore a black slouch
hat on Sunday afternoon, but on Mon
day morning wore a gray cap. He con>

OAKLAND. March 23.â Many society
folk braved thÂ» sudden and llâlj
rainstorm tn-night to see Miss Pearl
King make her initial bow as a profes
sional actress, and although she had al
most nothing to do, she was given an
enthusiastic greeting; that was a pleas
ing tribute not only to her well-known
ability, but to her personal popularity.
She played the part of Oharmian,
Cleopatra's confidential serving woman,
and made much of the small part.
Some of the most beautiful flowers
ever passed over the footlights were
sent to Miss King, and as the fragrant
tributes were passed to her until she
whs completely overwhelmed, the en
thusiasm of the audience knew no
bounds.
Miss Kins will have a more ambitious
part to play in Cymbetine and all are
anxious to see her then.
Miss Horteusp MeOMM as Cleopatra
and X^rval Macarregor as Mark An
thony were very clever. The company
throughout is fairly good.
Among the society people in the au
dience were: The F. M. Smiths. Miss
Bills, Miss Smith and Roland Oliver
in one party, the Laymances. the E. B.
Davises and Miss Crouch of Sacramen
to in another, Miss Gertrude Gould.
Mrs. W. W. Standoford, the A. A.
Denis< n?. Mrs. Albright and Miss Vio

YOUNG BOY DROWNED
IX MARK WEST CREEK
\uift Cnrrrnt Is Thought to Have
Carried the Body Into the
Kueeian River.
SANTA ROSA. March â John
M^gri was accidentally drowned in
Mark "West Creek last Tuesday at a
.point where it joins Russian River.
Magxi was alone when the fatality oc
curred. A boat in which he had been
rowing was found lodged in a branch
of a tree a short distance from shore.
To this boat another was attached by
a rope, indicating: . that Magri had
made an attempt to row up stream
with both boats. He was unable to
swim and it is believed that when his
boat struck the tree he jumped into
the stream and made an' attempt ; to
reach shore. The current in the creek
is swift and it is possible that the body
may have been carried into Russian
Itiver. ; ' .
Magri was 17 years of age and had
been in this country about a year.; He
was employed at the Farmer & Pet

SPANISH WAji VETERANS
MISUNDERSTAND THE ORDER
Adjutant General Lauck Explains His
Recent Announcement Regarding
Those Entitled to Pay.
SACRAMENTO, March 23. â Adju
tant General J. B. Lauck states that
there seems to be a misunderstanding
relative to pay due volunteers who en
listed in State organizations during
the Spanish-American war. General
Lauck says it seems to be the impres
sion that all those who served in the
war have claims against the United
State* Government and are to send
them to the State military authorities
to be taken up. This is a mistaken
idea, he says, as only claims for pay
from date of enrollment in a State or
ganization to date of muster-in to the
I'nit^d States volunteers, or to date of
rejection, will be considered. There
have been about 2500 of these claims
paid. but according to General
Lautk's statement there are fully that

DELANEY GETS
TOO TALKATIVE
Fugitive Burglar Wanted in
San Francisco Boasts of
His Crime in Tacoma Jail
TACOMA. Wash.. March 23.â 1f John
Delaney had kept his mouth closed San
Francisco police officers would not now
be en route to -Tacoma to take him
back there to stand trial for a daring
burglary committed there several
months ago. Delaney was arrested
here February 28 for snatching a suit
case from Mrs. Mueller of Everett as
she was taking a Portland train and
was sentenced to thirty days in Jail.
The officers made no attempt to secure
his previous record and it remained for
him to seal his own fate by telling his
fellow prisoners how bold and bad he
had been. During a comparison of their
misdoings, Delaney told the other pris
oners that he had committed a daring
burglary in San Francisco and later
had forfeited $4000 ball in order to make
a pleasure trip to Puget Sound. One of
these prisoners on being released told
a detective of Delaney's boast. Chief
Maloney wrote to San Francisco and
to-day received confirmation of Dela
ney's story in a letter from Captain
Spillane, in which the latter says:
"Whatever you do, don't let him get
away." Chief Maloney received a tele
gram this afternoon announcing that a
detective had started from San Fran
cisco with a bench warrant to secure
the prisoner.

FAVOR TOURIST
HOTEL SCHEME
Citizens of Oroville Are in
Accord With the Movement
and Beady to Donate Site
OROVILLE, March 23. â The citi
zens of Oroville are in accord with the
movement for a chain of tourist hotels
in the Sacramento Valley. A site of
from ten to fifteen acres will be do
nated and a local subscription to the
extent of $20,000 in stock will be tak
en in the new enterprise, if necessary.
Dr. R. N. Green, vice president of
the Sacramento Valley Development
Association, said to-day: "Oroville will
donate a â¢ite of from ten to fifteen
acres to the builder of a tourist hotel.
We will also take ud a local subscrip
tion for stock in the enterprise. I be
lieve fully $20,000 would be raised."
The movement for a chain of tourist
hotels is the result of the work of the
California Promotion Committee and
others who have been vigorously call
ing attention to this need in the val
ley.
The opinion is expressed that a ho
tel costing from $65,000 to $100,000
would be ample for Oroville at the
present time. Such a hotel, it is sug
gested, should be built so as to permit
additions without destroying its arch
itectural features.

31 ore Than Seven Years
FRESNO, March 23. â Seven years
ago Selim, a valuable trotter belonging
to Joaquin Madrid, a farmer on the
San Joaquin River, mysteriously disap
peared from his stable and this morn
ing he came home. Selim's owner was
awakened from his slumbers at dawn
by a whinny at the yard gate. Rising
and stepping out the front door, he was
struck dumb with astonishment to see
his long-lost pet eagerly pawing at the
fence. Madrid opened the gate and the
horse ran up to and frolicked about
him, unquestionably demonstrating his
joy and recognition.
On the night of February 26, 1898, Se
lim was taken from Madrid's stable,
hitched to a buggy the thief found in
the barn and driven away. Madrid
spent $100 in advertising and following
up clews, .but was never able to recover
his property. The rig was traced to

Carried Two Hundred Miles
After Its Abandonment
by Forgetful Mother
STERLING, 111., March 23.â The six
weeks' old babe of Mrs. E. R. Merry
man was carried 200 miles from home
yesterday before the anxious mother
discovered what had â  become of the
child.
Mrs. Merryman was met at the train
by her sister. She was so anxious to
get home that she forgot about her
sleeping infant and hurried away,
talking about her pleasant visit. After
a time she discovered she had forgot
the baby. Telegrams were sent after
the train, and in lowa the child was
found, still sleeping. In care of train
men it was sent home, arriving to-day.

BIG SMELTER
FOR TONOPAH
All Necessary Arrangements
Have Been Completed for
the Erection of the Plant
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
RENO, Nev., March 23.â The Western
Ore Purchasing Company, one of the
largest ore reducing companies in Ne
vada, will erect a large sampling wonts
and smelter at Tonopah. The plaat
will cost $100,000 and when completed
will be one of the best on the coast.
The building of the smelter at Tono
pah will mean much for the southern
gold country, and as a result many of
the smaller mines of Tonopah and
Goldfield will be worked extensively.
The small mine owners of the mining
camps are at present greatly handi
capped in turning their ore Into gold,
as they have to ship it to other points
in Nevada or California to have it
worked. They are at a great expense
in doing this and as a result are unabie
to work their claims to advantage.

MERCHANT MARINE. *
ALTHOI shipping bill, framed by the Merchant Marine
â¢ . failed to pass at the last session of Congress, the
cess are still bright; indeed, it seems al
most inevitable thai the bill, in very nearly its present shape-, will
ptly become a law when the next Congress meets. Congress
before a<ijonnirnem provided for the continuance of the commission
hatcver further inquiries it deems advisable in
the intervening summer months, and the bill will be introduced on
ie next session.
The good prospects for its passage are shown by the facts that
I favorably reported last session to both hon-es of Con

n w*s merely as to methods, not as to the [irinciple <>f
in shipping; and the administration prestige and ma
â¢ - next Congress will be so great the success of a measure
vifl Ik almost assured.
The three prominent features of the bill on which there is sub-
Mantial agreement between the majority and minority Senators and
Representatives are the naval retainer, the new ocean mail lines,
and the increased tonnage taxes; the only important feature about
which there is a difference is as to the method of encouraging gen
eral tonnage outside of the mail lines, on which point the majority
favor the subvention of $5 per gross ton.
The bill is receiving friendly attention in the Southern sea
pens. Newport News and Norfolk having formally approved it. and
the measure :s under consideration in New Orleans. It has the in
dorsement of the National Board of Trade. The Chamber of Com
n-.erce of San Francisco urged Congress to pass it. The masters and
pilots of steam vessels at their annual convention at Washington
also passed resolutions favoring it. Even as far inland as Cleve
land. Ohio, the business men are aroused to the importance of doing
something for the encouragement of our shipping; a short time ago
they met in the Union Club and declared* in their resolutions that
the foreign commerce of the United States had grown to the grand
total of $2,500,000,000, but that it is being carried to-day under for
n>n flags, and that "the situation is critical, and calls for immediate
action."
A STUDY OF STREET RAILWAYS.
THK report on street and electric railways for the year ending:
Tune. TOO 2. just published by the Bureau of the Census, and pre
-ed under the supervision of the chief statistician for manu
factures, Mr. W. M. Steuart. is a most valuable collection of detailed
ics, and is very interesting as showing the rapid development
â¢ansportation and its sociological effects. The report
C"=ide c tin statistics more than 200 pages of text prepared
â¢ special agents of the Bureau of Corporations.
Among the subjects treated are capitalization, relation of ex-
Tceipts, rates of fare, accidents, safety appliances, and
the wage?- and conditions of labor. On the subject of the growth of
railways it is noteworthy that electric traction has practically
superseded all other systems. The open conduit system has proved
-tftil in many localities, notably in New York and Washington.
hi theÂ«e cities there were operating 2^4 miles of this system in \<)O2.
In twelve years the mileage of the electric lines has increased from
rjfc to 21.907. while there \va< a decrease in the lines operated by
other motive power.
Interesting items are: The equipment of some lines with sleep
cars, a* in long distance lines in Indiana and Ohio. Nineteen
ITS are heated by electricity. California has the highest
â  â¢â in of rides to the urban population; this is attributed to the
- â¢â¢-. Wages iJT 56 per cent of the operating expenses, and
.000.000 is paid out to the carmen. The timid may find re
:rance in this item : only one passenger was killed for every 18.
"no.ooo who paid fares. Legislation permitting municipalities to
â¢1 and operate street railway? has been enacted in a number of
Ites, but there is no instance in the United States of* municipal
â¢ ration of a street railway.
FnHn the sociological point of view there are Several things of
â¢;-nce which the report will give opportunity to study. The
ecf of street railway development on the distribution of popula-
D is one of the chief of these. The increase in population of
nhattan borough in New York is about 500.000. and more
n one half of these are people who live seven miles from the
:Thern extremity of the city. Nearly five-sixths of the total in
â¢ ii's population is in the outlying wards. This is
\ an example of what is taking place in other centers. It is having
m effects on manufactures, on the concentration of business
centralized specialized centers, on suburban life, on the reduction
*.he evils of overcrowding and unsanitary surroundings.
'XHE Kaiser has taken his country into his confidence by stating
that while yet a boy he decided to give up all thought of achiev
ing empire of the world. It is just as well that he did. and that
he did it while so young is to his credit, and proves that he was wise
beyond his years.
There will be no more political world empire. Rome worked

It suppresses personal individuality, and the friction and compcti- i
â Of ideas and ingenuity. The governmental trust, the world!

v of the progress of civilization and the happiness of man.
The Kaiser's declaration of his policy to make the German peo
united and respected for their skill in the arts of peace
lerves the respect of the world. When such is the motive of every i
Government the world gets a general uplift, and the greater the num

THE CLUB LADIES.

taken by a ladies club, the leading one of the city which eatti

WORLD EMPIRE.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. MARCH 24. 1005
BETTERMENT OF CITY GOVERNMENT.
THE further, disclosures of the ramifications of ballot corruption at last year's primary call for con
certed action now, and not later, when it will be useless. If the subtle influence of the political push
be not resisted it will be found insidiously working its way to a substantial partnership of both par
lies in a scheme tor the maintenance of a system that is inconsistent with good government. Surely when
it i> found that corruption of government at its fountain head, the primary poll, is encouraged by high
<.!ticial authority, it is time for the city to wake up and take its bearings. It is possible for the people of
both parties to combine in a successful effort to destroy the system under which the reputation of San
i- rancisco has become tainted. It is sure that unless they do so they will be used in a combination that has
ther purpose than the continuance and survival of that system of shame and crime.
The Call has no interests in the matter that are not the interests also of all decent people and good
citizens. \\'e cannot alone enforce any policy that will lead to better things. We can only suggest the
obvious steps to he taken by such citizens as are sensitive to the good name and welfare of San Francisco.
1 f nothing be done now to bring righteous public sentiment into action and to make that action effective
by organization, the system will continue as it is. and those who could have prevented it will have lost
even the right to complain.
The Grand Jury, â apparently under great difficulties, has fearlessly and intelligently performed its
duty, it has focused a strong light upon the system, so that every one of its abhorrent details may be
seen and studied. The Grand Jury that has done this was drrwn from the mass of citizens in the ordin
ary way. and not by resorting to an elisor or other extraordinary methods of purging the panel which the
law j>ermits as a resort in extreme case?.. This very fact, that a Grand Jury so drawn is found entirely
responsive to the aims of civic decency, is a proof of the general purpose to smite the system in its lair,
wherever it may hide. It is proof undeniable of the desire of the city to combine and end, at the next
election, a system that protects and. promotes political immorality and fattens on a scheme of exaction*
that go into every relation of community life.
I liev want the ballot-box protected from fraud. Thcv want public administration free from graft and
programme to g-ive substantial ]>ower to indecency at the other end. They want a chance to make their
power felt and to cause it to be heeded by those in authority. They want such character and responsibility
I and respectability in office as will make it unnecessary for future Grand Juries to indict high public ofri
i cials for the most despicable of public crimes against good government.
But, while all this ks true, that same well meaning majority, divided between the two parties and
I separately fqllowing party standards and voting party tickets that have not been rationalized and right
; cned by an inspection or system of selection, will be as powerless as a clod. We have organizations of
citizens that have been formed for other purposes, but have been compelled to deal with the system whose
enormities they have assisted the Grand Jury in disclosing. Chief of these organizations is the Mer
chants" Association. It has been foremost in the good work. But it is doubtful it that association can
alone undertake the political regeneration of the city and its delivery from a system for which civic in
difference is responsible. The Merchants' Association is a powerful and necessary auxiliary to any
I cleansing movement, but the movement itself must be independent and in a position to fellow-ship not only
: the Merchants' Association but all others that represent righteousness in the community. The great com
| rnercial boards and bodies can also impinge upon a movement for reform, but cannot be expected to orig
! mate it.
\\ hat is needed js an organization not necessarily large in numbers, but of positively unimpeach
able character, personally disinterested, with motives above reproach, that will stand for the highest civic
aspirations, and that will sift the party nominations, fearlessly rejecting and as fearlessly approving, until
there will be presented practically orie ticket, certified to the voters as a foe to the system that is now im
peached and discredited.
If this be not done, if it seem unsuited to the situation, what else is proposed? We appreciate
the boldness with which the push and the associated Â«rat'iers in every city sneer at "respectability" in
politics. These malign influences are governed by men who have no small knowledge of human nature.
'I hey know the subtle leadings of personal ambition. They are w ise in the disinclination of respectability
to take much trouble in effecting public reforms. They know by their own experience the difficulty of
making an organization that offers no emolument nor material reward to its members. They have tested
the weakness of organizations that seek purely ethical. ends, without other reward than the sense of well
<lning. If any one expect that such men will let go becanse of exposure or even punishment of members of
their system, that expectation is vajrj. Unless the system itself be destroyed those who profit by it will
continue in it, considering exposure and punishment as merely the occasional risks of the business, and un
impressed by any moral consideration.

A solid gold bottle stood on the

said, "my hydrofluoric acid is kept.
Hydrofluoric acid is used in glass

colorless. It looks like water. But
a drop of it on your hand would bore
clean through to the other side like
a bullet. Its inhalation is sure death.
"Hydrofluoric acid can be kept safe

bottles of indiarubber, of lead or of

though. Is as safe as gold.
'Even when this acid is in a gold

it. It is volatile and hence a paraf

the temperature of the room must

A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE
About "Blood Purifiers" and "Tonics." j
Every drop of blood, every bone,

from wholesome food properly digest-
ed. There is no other way and the idea
that a medicine in itself can purify the

, the fol-de-rol that dyspepsia or indir
gtsÂ»ion is a germ disease, or that other
fallacy, that a weak stomach which re-
fuses to digest food can be made to do
60 by. irritating and inflaming the bow-
els by pills and cathartics.
Stuart's- Dyspepsia Tablets cure in-
digestion, sour stomach, gas and bloat-
ing after meals, because they furnish
the digestive principles which weak
itomachs lack, and, unless the defi-
ciency of pepsin and diastase is sup-
plied, it [â  useless to attempt to cure
stomach trouble by the use of "ton-

but well people who use them at every
meal to insure perfect digestion and

c' People who enjoy fair health take
Stuart's Tablets as regularly as they
take their meals, because they want to
keep well, prevention is better than
cure, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
-do both; they prevent indigestion and

PLANNING NEW
EUREKA RODTE
Proposed Bridge Over the
Sacramento River Is Part
of the Santa Fe Scheme
BIG EXPENSE SAVED
Line Will Extend Through
Lake County Joining Main
Koad at Point Richmond
The announcement made yesterday
that the recently incorporated Oak
land and Marysville Railroad Com
pany, an acknowledged property of
the Santa Fe, had applied to the Sec
retary of War for permission to con
struct a bridge across the Sacramen
to River from Black Diamond in Con
tra Costa County to a point on the So
lano County shore, a few miles south
of Birds Landing, has been followed
by a well founded report that this new
move, if successful, is part of a plan
to reach Eureka by an entirely new
route. It was learned yesterday from
a reliable source that the Santa Fe
engineers have for several months
been working on a proposed route to
the Northern California port that will
enable the company to eliminate many
of the difficulties that have been en
countered in the original plans for a
road up the coast through the moun
tainous and heavily timbered districts
of Mendocino and Humboldt counties.
In their reports concerning the
coast route the Santa Fe engineers
emphasized the fact that the build
ing: of a road in that direction would
entail an expense that has seldom
been experienced by the company in
its extensions throughout the West.
The Southern Pacific Company, in
projecting a survey from Willits to
Eureka, with the idea of anticipating
the northern progress of the rival
transcontinental line, was also con
fronted with similar difficulties and
the prospects of an unusual expense.
It was these facts, it is said, that
prompted the Santa Fe to look for an
other and a cheaper route, which they
rinally found through Lake County.
According to the reports in circula
tion yesterday and which the Santa
Fe officials would not confirm but re
fused to deny, that company will ex
tend its road north of Point Richmond
by way of Suisun to Lake County, and
thence north to Eureka, cutting
through Mendocino County on the
eastern side. By this means not only
Will new territory be invaded, but an
immense saving will be made through
the fact that the company will not
have to establish and maintain ter
minals on the Marin County shore,
which would be the case if the line
from Eureka came down the coast
on the original survey, and build and
operate freight and passenger boats
to handle traffic by that route. By
way of Lake County the branch line
would cross the Sacramento on the
proposed bridg of the Oakland and
Sacramento road and filially connect
with the main line of the Santa Fe
Company at Point Richmond. The en
tiro project, it is s;iid. is now under
deration by President Ripley and
the directors of the Santa Fe.

The twinkling feet of a favorite pre

Varesi, who is coming from Milan and
Rome to preet San Francisco music
lovers, will (lash through some of the
operas to be presented here in April
by the Conried Company.
When Mr. Conried was in Milan look
ine for exceptional talent for his com
pany in America he chanced to see the'
tall blonde Jtalian danseuse at La
Scala and immediately signed her for
the American tour of his aggregation
of stars. She made her American debut
in New SforK in the "Dance of the
Hours" In "La C>iaconda," and her tal
ent received instant recognition.
Prior to signing with Mr. Conreid
Slgnora Varesi had been in several fine
Italian companies and had appeared at
tfi? Teatro Lyrieo in Rome -and the San
Carlo in Naples. She is deemed one of
the most brilliant of the younger gen

SECOND RECITAL
BY KREISLER
IS BRILLIANT
Fritz Kreisler pave the second of his
recitals last night at the St. Francis
Hotel under the auspices of the St.
Francis Musk-al Art Society. A large
and fashionable audience was in at
tendance and gave enthusiastic approv
al to the violinist's programme. Chief
among its numbers was the Mendels
sohn concerto in E minor, an effort
brilliantly sympathetic and lovely in
all its phases. Bach finds Kreisler at
his noblest, and the Air was a charm-
Ing medium. The Tartini fugue, A
major, was another delicious perfor
mance, and Dvorak's "humoresque"
ni stubbornly redemanded and re
peated. An air of Goldmarck, the
"Chanson Sans Paroles" of Tschalkow
sky and Pepper's "Elfentanz" were
other numbers: the Sarasate "Zigeun
erweisen," played with brilliant pic
turesqueness and deviltry, crowned the
performance.
To-night's at the Alhambra is better.
The "Devil s Trill" sonata of Tartini
will be worth going miles for, and that
noblest of all violin compositions, the
Bach "Chaeonne," as Kreisler will
play it, will be worth crossing the con
tinent fur.

FOR DESERTER
Petitions of Churchmen
in Behalf of Arrowwood
Fail to Move President
SENTENCE IS APPROVED
Youth Who Could Not Be
a Christian Midshipman
Loses His Citizen's Eights
WASHINGTON, March 24.âPresi
dent Roosevelt has approved the sen
tence of the court-martial inflicted
upon Midshipman Arrowwood of North
Carolina, recently tried for desertion
from the navy. The sentence carries
with it dismissal from the navy, and
the law bearing upon the case provides
that a man so dismissed shall not here
after be eligible to any of the rights
of citizenship.
While Arrowwood was at the Naval
Academy his father, the Rev. Mr.
Arrowwood, insisted that he should be
allowed to attend the Presbyterian
Church at Annapolis, instead of the
college chapel. From time to time the
elder Arrowwood, in written communi
cations, protested to the Navy Departs
ment against what he declared to be
the "immoral atmosphere at the
academy."
While at sea young Arrowwood is
said to have frequently expressed him
self as dissatisfied with the service,
and told his brother officers that he
could make more money in private life.
Finally he submitted his resignation to
the department. It was not accepted.
On July 6 last, while the Kearsarse
was at Hampton Roads. Va., Arrow
wood left the ship. He was appre
hended in New York.
Within the last few days members
of the Presbyterian Church have ap
pealed to the President to mitisrate the
sentence, but the request was refused.

A card composed entirely of selling
<Â°vents furnished some ordinary sport
yesterday at Oakland. The plungers
were conspicuous by their disinclina
tion to unload on any of the many of
ferings. There appeared to be no dl
jninution in the attendance. Three fa
vorites were adorned with winning
brackets.
Class was entirely lacking except in
the fourth, a Futurity course sprint in
which a cluster of spry ones came to
gether. The gray horse K. M. Brattain
because of his light impost at first had
the call, but he has not thrived since
coming up from Ascot Park, and ne
finally divided with David Boland the
honors of favoritism. The gray had
speed, but the supply did not last long.
for he relinquished the lead to David
Boland before reaching the turn for
home.
BEDEL'S FINISHES GAMELY.
The thn-e-vear-old looked all over a
winner, when, at the paddock, Travers
brought Iredeus along with a rush,
scoring by nearly a length. After get
ting away poorly, St. George Jr. ran a
remarkably good race, only losing the
place to Boland by a head. Bell Reed
was outclassed.
Looking a legitimate S-to-5 < hance,
the price about I'm Joe went from 3
to 1 to 21 to 5 in the betting on the two
year-old scramble. The books got out
of line, for he was played down to 2.
and in a driving finish beat Yolo Girl
easily a length. Sir Edward, a 100-to-l
shot, ran third.
There were eight starters in the first
mile and a sixteenth selling number
for beaten non-winners since May 1,
1904. Tommy Clark had the mount on
Maxetta, the favorite, and after get
ling into half a dozen pockets, finished
third. The winner turned up in Dun
dreary, the mount of Knapp, who
made most of the running and disposed
of Emshee by three lengths.
TOWERS IX FRONT.
Eleven rehabilitated specimens of the
thoroughbred lined up in the split of
the mile and a sixteenth number. Mt.
Diablo, ridden by Travers. finally
I the favorite, and in a driving
finish earned a neck decision over Lone
Fisherman, the mount of Bullman. The
f-how went to Brown Pats=y.
Sterling Towers, a 10 to 1 shot, de
feated a fair bunch of sprinters in the
fifth, a six furlong selling run. Jones
pot the outsider away first, and in a
mild drive at the close the mare crossed
the line almost a length in advance of
Mountebank. Bullman gathered show
honors with Redan. My Suprrise, the
P"gt favorite, showed some early speed,
then developed a "yaller" streak.
Chandler, on Dora I, rode a poor race.
From early morn Edgecllff had been
heralded as the red-hot one for the
concluding race of the day, and the Ed
die Jones gelding arrived on time. His
odds were played from 3 to 11 to 5 fa
voritism and after an early drive he
downed Gloomy Gus a length. Baker
took the show. Royal Red was the
recipient of a ludicrous ride.
â¢ . TRACK NOTES.
Travers was the only jockey to ride
two winners.
When racing in the Jennings colors
Iredeus was known as Iridius. The
horse was registered under the for
mer name. t
Since Monday of the present week
Edrodun, Sun Rose. Homage, David
Boland. Dundreary, Mount Diablo and
Edgecliff. all cast-offs of the Burns &
Waterhouse stable, have captured
purses.
The Treat stakes for two-year-olds
at five furlongs will be run at Oak

of the best youngsters in training will

In answer to query: Eddie Jones
and Torsida met in a match race at
Ingleslde track in 1897 for $700 a
side. The former was a 7 to 10 fa
vorite and won easily.

FOOTPADS FIND
MANY VICTIMS
Two footpads shortly after 11
o'clock Wednesday night entered the
grotery store of R. Stolzenwald, 272
First street. Each wore a mask. One
robber had a revolver in his right
hand and the other a revolved in each
hand.
â¢'Throw up your hands" was the
command given, and the grocer, who
was alone in the store, promptly
obeyed. The thugs went through
Stolxenwald's pockets and then turned
attention to the cash register. They
got altogether $23.
"If you attempt to make an out
cry I will blow your head off," said
one of the highwaymen, and he struck
Stolzenwald a blow on the back of
the neck with the butt end of his re
volver, which sent him sprawling on
the floor. With another warning to
keep quiet the robbers decamped.
Stolzenwald told Policeman Helms
of his experience. Helms made a
search of the neighborhood, but couii
find no trace of the hold-up men.
Stoltenwald describes one as about 6
feet tall, dressed in dark clothes and
Derby hat. and the other 6 feet 4
inches tall, dressed In dark clothes and
soft black hat.
John Thompson, a saloon keeper at
23â¬ Third street, while closing his sa
loon shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday
morning, was approached by a man
who without saying a word struck
him a blow on the chin that brought
him to his knees. The robber made a
grab for Thompson's gold watch and
chain, but the chain was too strong
and resisted his efforts to break it.
Thompson shouted for help and the
robber fled. Thompson's cries were
heard by Policeman J. J. Cameron,
who saw a young man running toward
Howard street from Tehama. Cameron
headed him off and captured him.
Thompson identified the prisoner as
the man who had assaulted and at
tempted to rob him. The prisoner
gave the name of Frank A. Myers and
said he had been in the navy and
lived at 147 Natoma street. He was
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of assault with intent to rob.
Herbert Yanderhoor. a musician,
about midnight yesterday morning was
walking along Polk street, and as he
neared Filbert street a man with a
revolver in his hand stepped up to
him and ordered him to throw up
hiÃ hands. Vanderhoof obeyed and
the footpad relieved him of $2, all
the money he had in his pockets. It
was so dark that Vanderhoof was un
able to obtain a good look at the
mnn.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. MARCH 24. 1905.
HANGMAN'S KNOT
IS POORLY TIED
Pittsburg Murderer Is Com
pelled to Climb Steps
to the Gallows Twice
PITTSBURG, March 23.â Reno Dar
daia and William J. Byers were
hanged here to-day. When the trap
was sprung for Byers the loop of the
noose pulled away, precinftating him
to the ground. For a mpGte he stag
gered around under the scaffold, and
then Sheriff Dickson caught him and,
removing the noose and black cap, car
ried him into the Jail. He was not
badly hurt as the result of the fall.
The rope was again adjusted and By
ers pale and trembling, was again
placed on the scaffold and the trap
sprung. This time there was no mis
hap and death resulted from strangu
lation.
Byers was convicted on his own con
fession of the killing of August J. Lay
ton of Turtle Creek, Pa., June 3, 1901.
In the confession he implicated Lay
ton's wife and John McWilllams. They
were tried and acquitted. McWilliams
afterward married Mrs. Layton.
Dardaia killed Thomas Sinclair at
Imperial, Pa., in September, 1903, dur
ing a quarrel over a drink of whisky
and a dollar. He claimed the killing
was in self-defense.
FISHERMAN ALMOST SEVERS
HIS NECK WITH A RAZOR
Peter Poulsen, Despondent From Ex-
cessive Drinking, Attempts to
End His Existence.
Despondent from excessive drinking,
Peter Poulsen of 381 Dore street made
a desperate attempt to end his life last
night by slashing his throat with- a
razor, nearly decapitating himself. All
that prevented complete decapitation
was the spinal column. Poulsen is
still alive, but there is little hope of
his recovery.
Poulsen is a fisherman, and, accord
ing to his brother's story, he has been
on a spree for some time. About 5
o'clock last night Mrs. Poulsen heard
a noise in her son's room. Upon en
tering the apartment she was horrified
to find her son on the floor with a
deep gash in his throat and a razor
lying beside him. Assistance was
called for and Poulsen was removed
to the Central Emergency Hospital:
Dr. W. E. Stevens, assisted by Dr.
Millar, performed a delicate operation.
Both jugular veins were severed, as
was also the trachae and aesophagus.
The surgeons sewed the ends of the
veins and the food and air passages.
Salt solution was tranfused into Poul
sen's veins to supply the loss of blood.
Later Dr. Millar insulated a silver tube
to Rrevent the patient from choking to
dcatfc.

DR. BOTHE CRITICIZED
BY CORONER LELAND
Chemist Morgan Files Report Show-
ing That the Physician Made a
Serious Error.
Coroner Leland expressed his opin
ion yesterday that City Chemist A. C.
Bothe had made a serious blunder
when he reported that he had found
crystals of strychnine in the stomach
of an unidentified man who died in
the Central Emergency Hospital on
the night of March 8.
Drs. Millar and Stephen testified at
the inquest that the decedent showed
all the symptoms of opium poisoning
and none of the symptoms of strych
nine, and that the symptoms arising
from the administration of these two
poisons were widely dissimilar and
couid not be mistaken one for the
other, even upon a cursory examina
tion. Dr. Bothe admitted that he had
not made a qualitative anaylsis of the
crystals found, but that upon exam
ining them through a microscope
they presented the appearance of
strychnine crystals.
Owing to a suspicion which the Cor
oner entertained for some time as to
the competency or carefulness of
Chemist Bothe he sent the first wash
ings of the dead man's stomach in a
bottle to Dr. Charles L. Morgan for
a thorough qualitative analysis. Dr.
Morgan reported yesterday that he
had found evidence of morphine, but
none whatever of strychnine. The
decedent was addicted to the use of
the drug.
DID NOT SAIL AWAY
' WITH HIS REGIMENT
Lieutenant William Goolsby, U. S. A^
May Have to Face a
Court-Martial.
Lieutenant William E. Goolsby, U.
S. A., will probably have to face a
trial by court-martial. He failed to
embark with his regiment, the Twen
ty-first Infantry, when that command
sailed for Manila the first of last
month. The young officer was de
tained to answer as defendant in sev
eral civjj suits brought against him in
the local courts and it is alleged that
the War Department has determined
to discipline the lieutenant.
When the transport with the Twenty
first Infantry sailed Goolsby failed to
put in an appearance at the dock and
his regiment went away without him.
Lieutenant Francis M. Boon, Nine
teenth Infantry, who was shot and
seriously wounded at Vancouver Bar
racks on March 15. is now out of dan
ger. So soon as he is able to travel he
will be brought to Alcatraz, where he
will serve, out his sentence, which is
imprisonment for one year, after
which he will be dishonorably dis
charged from the army.
To-day is field day at the Presidio.
All the troops now stationed at the
post, with the exception of the Eighth
Cavalry, temporarily encamped there,
will take part in the exercises, which
will begin at 9 o'clock. x
Quarry Ordinance Is Valid.
Judge Lawlor yesterday decided
that the ordinance prohibiting a quar
ry from being operated or maintained
in certain portions of the city was'

case of John Kelso, contractor, who

Police Judge Cabaniss on January 12,
1904, of violating the ordinance and
took an appeal to the Superior Court.
The Judge rendered his decision yes

The San Francisco Athletic League
field day, which was postponed last
Saturday on account of the condition
of the track, will be held at Berkeley
oval on April 1. The delegates from
the schools comprising the league met
and voted to hold the meet upon April
1. As to the most feasible place there
was considerable discussion, which re
sulted in an attempt to secure the
racecourse at Ingleside. The commit
tee found the track unavailable and
will therefore hold the contest at
Berkeley, as originally intended.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUFFALO, March 23.â With Charles
Mitchell Jr. as guide and accompanied
by a retinue of sports, Jabez White,
the English lightweight champion, and
his manager, Charley Mitchell, visited
Niagara Falls this afternoon. The big
waters interested the Briton. He was
fascinated by the rapids and deafened
by the roar of the river as it plunged
over the falls.
"There's just two things in sight-see
ing I craved to see In this country,"
confessed the fighter. "Niagara Falls
was o*ne, and the stock yards at Chi
cago is the other. I anticipate an in
teresting day to-morrow In Chicago.
"I will take op Jimmy Britt first,"
he said, "and then, if Battling Nelson
would like to face me in the ring, I
will be willing to accommodate him.
having heard so much about his abil
ity. I have also received other offers
which have Impressed me favorably.
I shall probably return East soon for
several of those six- round, no-decision
affairs in Philadelphia."
When asked about Jim . Corbett,
Mitchell said: v "I would agree to box
Corbett. If there is anything in it,
I'll fight him any time, any place and
for any amount. I'm bloomin* heavy,
over 200 pounds, but Corbett can't beat

JERE DUNN MAY REFEREE.
Veteran Sporting Man May Judge the
Hart-Johnson Bout.
When Marvin Hart and Jack John
son step into the ring at Woodward's
Pavilion next Tuesday night to decide
the all-absorbing question of who
may have the right to a battle with
Champion Jim Jeffries, the fight-lov
ing public of San Francisco will wit
ness the first heavy-weight contest of
any importance that has been held
here for more than two years. Most
of the heavy-weight fights that have
been decided In this city have been
fiascos or have terminated unsatisfac
torily, but It hardly seems likely that
the Hart-Johnson affair will be any
thing but a bonafide scrap.
Both of the principals are young
and strong and conscientious train
ing has brought them to perfect physi
cal condition. Besides the long end of
the purse, a match with Jeffries may
possibly be the lot of the victor.
McCormick, who manages Hart, and
Zick Abrams, who acts in a similar ca
pacity for Johnson, met last night to
select the referee. Alex Greggains was
the choice of both men, but the club
manager seems reluctant to accept the
position. Jere Dunn, the veteran sport
ing man, is a possible compromise can
didate.
The advance sale opens this morn
ing at Greggains' cafe, 112 Ellis street.
BRITT-NELSON IMBROGLIO.
Rival Boxers and Managers Are Kept
Widely Separated by Friends.
Battling Nelson and Manager No
lan remained at Larkspur yesterday
upon the advice of friends, who felt
a personal encounter was inevitable if
they met the Britts.
Willie Britt. with his hands signif
icantly incased in a stout pair of gloves,
waited and waited, but no one crossed
his path. Willie is the worst match
maker in the world in his own be
half, size cutting no figure when his
blood runs warm.
Jimmy Britt says he will not enter
into negotiations for a match with
Nelson until he has disposed of White.
While he does not say so, it is evident
it will be months before he faces the
Dane in the ring again.
Charley Mitchell's strange an
nouncement that he and his son will
be the only persons to see White train
has stirred up a lot of unfavorable
comment. W r illie Britt said he would
not permit such a state of affairs. As
he does not appear to be handling
W T hite's interests it is possible the
Englishman's advisers will have their
way. The followers of boxing in Cal
ifornia had a recent experience with
Rickards. the Chicago phenom, who
"fought" Berger. No one was allowed
to see him work out until his farcical
showing with Berger. The opinion of
Charley White, the New York referee,
on Jabez White is interesting at this
time. After returning from England
he said half the featherweights in
this country could defeat White.
KNIPE TO MEET BERGER.
NEW YORK, March 23. â Dr. Jo
seph Knipe, the well-known "ama
teur" heavy-weight boxer of this city,
has received an offer from Alex Greg
gains, the San Francisco fight pro
moter, to meet Sam Berger during May
on the coast. Knipe has accepted
the offer and awaits the terms of the
club. Knipe has defeated almost
every man he has met. He is glad of
the chance to meet the California
man.
RAIN STOPS THE PLAY

The young lady tennis players made
another effort to finish their handicap

CHASE'S STAND
MAKES TROUBLE
If Southern First Baseman
Does Not Report to New-
York War 3lay Be Result
WILL *AID THE LEAGUE
Other Minor Associations
Likely to Cast Lot With
Powers of Pacific Coast
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK. March 23.â Officials of
the Greater New York Baseball Club
have received a telegram from Chair
man Hermann of the National Base
ball Commission, promising immediate
action in the fight over the services of
Hal Chase. Even If the Pacific Coast
League yields to the commission*
order to give up the player the chances
are that Chase will not join the High
landers before the championship sea
son opens, as he will remain in LoÂ»
Angeles while his future is in doubt.
If he appears aa a member of the L>>Â«
Angeles team when the Coast League
season opens on the 31st inst. the com
mission will put the outlaw brand oa
that league. All other league teams
the country over will then be invited
to help themselves to California play
ers without asking permission of toe
clubs employing them.
If the National Commission declare*
the Pacific Coast Baseball League aa
outlaw organization the old war will
be in force once again. It will mean a
jump in players' salaries, and a race
between the magnates of thi3 league
and the major bodies to see who can
grab the available players the fastest.
When Morley signed Chase a tew
daye ago he acted on the theory that
war really existed between the Pacific
Coast League and the two major
bodies. Morlpy must have known
something was about to hapjpen, for
he would scarecly take it upon himself
to act so rashly in such an important
matter.
If the national commission declares
war on the Pacific Coast League it is
a foregone conclusion the other class
A minor leagues will cast th4?ir lots
with this association. When Howard
Griffiths of New Jersey and Tip O'Neill
of the Western League conferred with
the home magnates a few v.->-,h ago
they practically came to an agreement
to stand together and fight the big
leagues in case of war.
President Bert and the other mag
nates of the Pacific Coast League arÂ«
not overanxious to be controlled by
the national commission. Since joining
the association the Pacific Coast
League has been givn the worst of
every deal that has been pulled off. It
is likely the present case may be a
means >f breaking away from thÂ«
agreement.
HOLDS GRAND JURORS DID
NOT ACT THROUGH BIAS
Judge Lawlor Denies Motion to Set
Aside Indictments Against Chan
Cheung and Eppinicrr*.
Judge Lawlor yesterday afternoon
denied the motions made on behalf
of Chan Cheung and Herman. Jacob
and Josua Eppinger and James Dem
ings to set aside the indictments on
the ground of bias and prejudice on
the part of grand Jurors.
In the case of Chan Cheung, in
dicted for the murder of Tom Tick
of the Chinese Educational Society, it
was contended that Foreman Andrews
of the Grand Jury was prejudiced in
view of the "sweating " to which the
defendant had been subjected as to
corruption in Chinatown. The Judge
held that it could not be contended
that the defendant's rights had been
prejudiced by the mere presence la
the jury-room of Foreman Andrews.
In the cases of the Eppingers and
Demings stress was made by the de
fendants upon the fact that Grand
Juror James B. Smith was disquali
fied because he had been one of the>
jurors to bring in the orisrinal indict
ment against Herman and Jacob Ep
pinger. The Judge said he believed
that Smith had been a fair juror aa
a matter of fact and that he acted
fairly and impartially.
Chan Cheung was granted twenty
days to tÂ»le a bill of exceptions, and
the Eppingers and Deminga wert
granted forty days for the same purÂ»
pose.

dition on Wednesday night. They

FRANCOIS MAY BE MISTAKE
NSURANCE ADVANCES TO SEVENTY AND HOPES TUMBLE
A cablegram received yesterday from
Â£osdon by M. A. Newell has cast a
uair.p cloud of doubt upon the dreams
of those local speculators whose $50,
&0Q; Invested en the overdue French
\,u: k ( Francois, "to arrive," promised a
few days ago to return $4 for every Ji
risked". The dream may still come
:raÂ£, but the element of uncertainty
[a creat enough to cause an advance in
-Jbe Francois' rate to 70 per cent.
The cablegram from the British caD
ital/Eays that it was probably the"
French bark L'Hermitte which wa*
epeken and not the Francois This
speaking was reported when the rate
01: the Francois stood at â  per cent
At that figure the investment looked
gocd to those interested in reinsurance
speculation, and the Francois to arrive
vas bought freely, $50,000 being placed
in the hands of M. A. Newell. When
â¢tvjÂ£ a ? D f was reported the rate
.urnbjed to 5 per cent, and the men
Â«*0 had subscribed the $50,000 rubbed
Their hands in glee, congratulated
themselves on their Keen perception
%Â£ Tr^^T* figuring on replacing
-engine in the automobile with
t-mething of higher power.
Then came yesterday's message from
.-,r.don. and to-day the old automobile
iooxs fairly good. -;;
The signal letters of the Francois are
li MB L."HermittP . signal let
:eÂ« are J xv M B. The similarity
. uiese combinations is supposed now
> ha.ye been responsible for the error,
juid :t is cow feared that the Francois
which left this port ISS days ago. has
rot been seen since she got clear of
lais coast. The letters H and W have
Borne points of similarity, but there
La a vast difference between winning
J.ou.O'JO and pocketing a loss of $50,900.
All speculators, however, did not
lose. To some of them the Francois
has been a gold mine. When the rate
dropped to 5 per cent the wise ones
ivfco had bought at 85 to arrive had no
difficulty in selling out at a neat profit.
With the proceeds they bought, at 5
per cent. Francois, "not to arrive."
When the cablegram received yester
day sent the rate soaring to 70 per
cent, they sold out again, getting more
:haft ten -f oid for their Investment.
Some of them have bought again, this
time "to arrive."
â¢ Andther overdue vessel which is at
tracting: considerable local attention is
the .British ship Eskasoni, from Ta
coma. She passed the Lizard fourteen
days ago on- her way to Limerick. She
hat not yet reached her destination and
is reinsured at 10 per cent. The EÂ«ka-
SO! is well known at this port.

HEINOUS CRIME
OF NEGRO FIEND
u Yo<Hioo" Doctor Is Being
Tried for Cutting Out the
Heart of a Little Child
HAVANA, March 23.â "Kine" Bou
court, a negro of African birth, has
been placed on trial under the charere
made some months ago that he had
killed a white child twenty months old.
The child's body was found at Guira de
Melena. horribly mutilated and with
the heart removed.
Charges were made that Boucourt
posed as a "voodoo" doctor and that
when an old negress consulted him
for treatment he advised that her only
remedy was to eat the heart of a white
person. Kidnaping of the chiid vic
tim is alleged to have followed. A
dozeji negroes were arrested and
charged with being accessories to the
crime.
Owing to the great fear in which
the 'Voodoo" doctors are held there
haa been great difficulty thus far in
obtaining testimony. The trial U at
tracting much interest in Havama.

ORIENTAL CITY
FOR BAY SHORE
Substantial Step in Scheme
for the Removal of China
town Taken by Promoters
DOCTORS IN PROJECT
Corporation Provides for
Bond Issue and Will Ask
Deeds From Kealty Owners
The actual work, of securing the
agreements of two-thirds or more of
the property-owners? of Chinatown to
conditionally deed their property for
the purpose >>Â£ â¢.â an > ins; "lit tho am
bitious project of reclaiming that dis
trict and establishing an Oriental city
on the bay shore will be commenced
next week.
On Wednesday there was filed with
the County Recorder a resolution
passed by the board of directors of
the corporation having the project in
hand authorizing a bond issue of
$7,300,000. This corporation is the
L'nited States Improvement and In
vestment Company, which has fitted
up a whole tloor at 53S California
t-tieei as afHkittS. Its president is
George E. Ames. John Partridge is
its first vice president: Dr. C. G. Ken
yon, second vice presidenjt; Charles E.
Moody, general manager, and Horatio
Beveridge, secretary. The directors
are George E. Ames, D. B. Moody. Ed
ward F. Delger, Dr. John N. W'liiam
son. Dr. C. G. Kenyon, Charles E.
Moody, John Partridge, Dr. W. B.
Lewitt and Dr. A. Miles Taylor. The
advisory board consists ,of Captain
Charles Nelson, George U. Hind. H.
W. Postlethv.aite. Dr. John Gallwey,
Dr. Gerfcld G. Fitzgibbons. Dr. W. B.
Coffey, Dr. William E. Hopkins, Dr.
Vincent Buckley. Stanley Forbes, R.
L. Rigdon. L. H. Bonestell. O. W.
Xordwell and Dr. George Chismore.
Though the project is being carried
on by a private corporation with the
object of profit, there is a sentimental
and artistic side to it. Several lead
ing physicians are on the list of of
ficers and directors. Nearly every one
of these has at some time or another
had something to do with the purifica
tion of Chinatown and they probably
look on the present project as a solu
tion of the problem that health bodies
have always found confronting them.
The success of the scheme rests on
the securing of pledgesVf two-thirds
uf the property In the district. The
corporation figures that with this
amount it can handle the rest. Each
property-owner will be asked to sign
an agreement and a deed, which will
be placed in escrow with the Mercan
tile Trust company, which is trustee
for the bonds. For each deed there
will also be placed in escrow a cer
tificate of class A stock, representing
the face value of the property to-day
and attached to this will be a bond,
which will be security for the face
value of the stock. The property
owner will get a certificate of stock as
security for what he owns and the
â¢stock wtl! participate in one-third of
all the profits of the corporation. He
will also acquire, in proportion to the
stock he owns, a one-third interest in
the new Chinese city. The agreements
with the property-owners will become
effpctive only when two-thirds of the
holdings are represented.
"There are 550 owners of Chinatown
property." said Manager Moody yes
terday, "thirty-three being Chinese.
The exclusion act has reduced the
population of the quarter from 40.000
to 20,000, but this leaser number oc
cupies twice the area that the 40.000
occupied. The revenue from the porp
erty, with a few exceptions, has de
creased from 50 to 90 per cent."
The sixteen blocks of Chinatown are
assessed at $3,000,000 and the corpora
tion estimates their value at 56.000.000
under the present conditions. It is
alleged that the land alone will be
worth $25,000,000 with the buildings
removed.

MAKES CHARGE
OF CONSPIRACY
Dr. T. R. Woollard Sues Mem
ber of the Board of Dental
Examiners for License
FRED 0. BAIRD ACCUSED
Plaintiff Says He Is Guilty
of Effort to Keep Down
Number of Practitioners
Conspiracy to. keep down the num
ber of dentists In California that "he
and his coconspirators may enjoy a
monopoly in the profession Is' the
charge made against Fred G. Baird.
a member of the Board of Dental Ex
aminers, by .â " Dr. T. R. Woollard in a
suit filed yesterday. Dr. Woollard
asks that the court issue a writ of
mandate compelling Dr. Baird to Issue
to him a temporary license to practice
dentistry in this State, the same to
stand until the next regular meeting
of the board in July, when the plain
tiff will submit to examinations as
to his qualifications to continue . the
practice of his profession here.
In his petition for - the writ Dr.
Woollard alleges that on February 7
last he applied to Dr. Baird for a
temporary license, but was refused,
notwithstanding that he is a graduate
ot.the Chicago College of Dental Sur
gery and practiced his profession five
yeais in the East. He persisted in his
demand, however, he, says, and finally,
on March 4. Dr. Baird examined him
as to his qualifications. Contrary to
law. he says, Dr. Baird propounded
to him technical and impractical
questions in san . effort to catch
him. but failed in his object, as
he was able to answer the questions
satisfactorily. Dr. ' Baird. however,
piqued at this earnest desire to get the
license, maliciously refused to issue
the I temporary license, petitioner al
leges. Â ... -. , .. --â â  .
In conclusion the 'petitioner says he
has been informed and believes that
Dr. Baird has entered into a conspir
acy with other dentists of the State to
keep down the number of dentists,
that the Droflts of those now practic
ing may be increased, and that I In
line with this conspiracy they refuse
to grant licenses to any one except
certain favored applicants. The board
will not meet again before July, plain
tiff says, and in consequence he .wants
the court to compel the Issuance to
him of a temporary license, that he
may practice by virtue of its authority
until such time as he is enabled to
qualify before the entire board.

affliction, to hold a position, and hi 3
landlords and compatriots. Y. Hamano

WEBER DENIED

Trial of the Noted Cmc
AUBURN. March 23.â Since the trial
of Adoiph Weber. Sheriff Keena has
relaxed the rules with regard to al
lowing visitors to see Weber, and many
persons have been allowed to converse
with him. For some reason unex
plained, the stringent regulations in
force before the trial have been again
put In force by the Sheriff.
Grove LÂ». Johnson, Weber's attorney.
came up from Sacramento Wednesday
to see the pris. ner. He was accom
panied by Dr. Twitchell. who wu for
two years at the Mendocino State hos
pital, and who desired to examine
Weber and ascertain the state of his
health. Deputy Sheriff May told J-:,-hn
son he was sorry but Sheriff Keena
had given strict orders that no one bu:
the prisoner's attorneys should b
lowed to see or converse with him. H^
therefore declined to allow the physi
cian to see Weber, or to allow Weber ta
go into the corridor. Attorney John
son appealed to Judge Prewett. and h-Â»
communicated with Sheriff Keen*, ask
ing him to relax the rule so far
allow the physician t<> examine th
prisoner, and the Sheriff consented to
do so. Dr. Twitchell examined Weber
carefully, but the result of his exam
ination was not made public. It is sup
posed to be In relation to a motion f<>r
a new trial and possibly a move t>
raise the issue of insanity. Weber's
health, his attorneys say. is being in
jured by too close confinement and lack
of exercise.

From a Eoy at College
MARKED COINS AS TRAP
Harris Confesses to Long
Hist of Peculations, Fol
lowing His Detection
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, March 23.
Full confession was made to-day by j
J. A. Harris, the senior at the univer- ;
sity who was caught yesterday steal- j
ing from a locker in Harmon gym- :
nasium, his offenses including the theft
of jewelry belonging to his fellow stu- i
dents, in addition to money he secured
from their clothing. Harris has told
of taking a gold watch belonging to a '
student and pawning it in an Oakland
establishment, where he gave the name j
of M. W. Weston, a junior at the uni
versity. Harris had the pawn ticket
and surrendered it to the officers. The j
watch was recovered to-day.
Harris' confession was made because
he hopes to escape prosecution on a
more serious charge than that of petty
larceny, which has been lodged against
him. He admits that he is guilty of a
long series of thefts, all of which have
been reported and are on record at the
office of Ground Superintendent Bol
ton. His method, as related to the of- j
fleers who caught him yesterday, was
to use a jimmy, which he procured
from the college of mechanics, and
with this to open lockers which he
thought might contain money left by
studentÃ who were exercising in gym- ,
nasium suits. .
Marked coins placed in the locker of !
B. C. Goldsmith proved his undoing :
yesterday, Superintendent Bolton hav
ing arranged that marked money
should be placed where Harris could
get it easily. The student fell into the '-,
trap, was caui^ht soon after with the ;
marked coins on him and then admit- !
ted his guilt.
Harris' case will be the first to re- I
ceive attention from the newly ap- j
pointed students' affairs committee, ;
made up of students who purpose to |
assist in administering undergraduate
discipline.

MAY SHUT OFF
WATER SUPPLY
Companjr Notifies Haywards
Trustees That It Will Not
Serve Town at Old Rate
CITIZENS HAVE X 0 FEAR
Threat of the Corporation
Causes Little Alarm in
the Suburban Community
HAYWARDS, March 23.â Haywards
is involved in a water rate war with
the San Lorenzo Water Company
which threatens to result in the com
plete suspension of the present water
supply. B. T. McÃain, the treasurer
of the water company, has served a no
tice on each member of the Board of
Town Trustees notifying them that if
the old rate is re-established the com
pany will cease to supply water to the
town of Haywards after July 1, 1905.
Notwithstanding the action of the
water company the Trustees, at the
regular meeting of the board last night,
introduced a resolution re-enacting the
old rates, and there is little doubt that
the ordinance will be passed at the
next meeting of the board, which will
be held on Wednesday evening, April 5.
The majority of the Trustees believe
that the water company is endeavor
ing to '"bluff" the ratepayers, and they
are determined to give the corporation
an opportunity to make good its de
tlaitd intention of shutting off the
water supply of the town.
It is the general opinion of the citi
zens of Haywards that the San Loren
zo Water Company is simply a dummy
corporation representing one of the
large water companies about the bay.
The local company was organized by
the late Ofestes Pierce, and was con
trolled by him until his death. It has
never been learned just who secured
control of the stock held by Mr. Pierce,
and the present officials absolutely re
fuse to give any information on the
subject.
The members of the Board of Trus
tees express little fear that the com
pany will carry out its threat to shut
off the water supply, and it is be
lieved that every member of the board
will vote to re-establish the old rate.
The notice served on the members of
the board reads as follows:
SAX FRANCISCO. Cal., March 18. 1905.
Tv the Mayor and LSoard of Trustees, Town
of Hayward* â Gentlemen : The water company
desires to Kiva notice that it Is advised that
the water ratrs of last year are to be adopted
for the cuminsc fiscal year. This company
cannot furnish water at those rates except at
a irreat loss, and we take this opportunity to
advise you that should said rates be adopted
this company will cease to supply water to
the town of Haywards and its citizens from
and aft>?r the Ist day of July. A. D. 1906.
Yours truly.
SAN LORENZO WATER COMPANY,
B. T McÃain. Treasurer.

the owners.

HUNGRY SOLDIER
DISORDERLY.
Settles for $100 Appetite
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Private James Meagher, Ninth Bat
tery, United States Field Artillery, ar
rived last Thursday from the Philip
pines, where hard service and unpal
atable rations equipped him with an
appetite that any gourmet wo-uld yearn
to acquire. So, when he received his
back pay, amounting to more than
one hundred dollars, he systematically
set out to indulge in epicureau revel.'
Fearful that his long-pinched gastro
nomic organs might not be able to ac-
commodate the rich viands his spirit
craved, he devoted an afternoon to
training them for the reception, delug
ing them with bitters and other liquids
warranted to promote hunger, and oc
casionally partaking of tidbits from the
free lunches spread so abundantly in
the downtown saloons.
Ere the day closed he felt himself
fit for the feasting, and at 11 o'clock
p. m. his legs were stretched beneath
a mahogany in Martin Ivanovich's
grill room, in the California market.
Placing $100 on the table, he informed
Mr. Ivanovich that he desired to eat
as large a hole in the golden pile as
nature would allow. Then he began
ordering, and when he had eaten and
drunk until the inner man was satis
fied he sat back in his chair and with a
sigh of contentment called for his bill.
This is what the waiter handed to him:
One family porterhouse steak, one English
tenderloin of sole, eighteen large Eastern
oysters eighteen eggs 'fried), fifteen pint bot
tles of beer; total cost. $fV
He pronounced the demand exorbi
tant, and to emphasize his protest de
liberately smashed $4 worth of dishes,
thus provoking arrest and incarcera
tion on the charge of defrauding an
innkeeper.
"Did he consume all he ordered?"
Police Judge Mogan asked the com
plaining restaurateur.
"Never in all my days did I see a
man eat so rapidly or so much." was
the answer. "Why. he kept a cook and
waiter so busy filling his orders that
they could not attend to anything
else."
â¢ How about that," said his Honor
to the defendant.
"I ordered the grub, all right," re
plied Private Meagher, straightening
up his tall figure and saluting the
bench a la militaire, "but I didn't ex
pect to be charged so much for it. I
offered him $5. but he wouldn't take it.
That offer still goes."
Mr. Ivanovich declared that one of
the demolished dishes alone had cost
him $2 50, and by taking $5 he would
be giving away money. Then the Judge
suggested that the difference be split,
and after some demur by both sides a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. MARCH 24, 1906.
compromise was effected on that basis,
and Private Meagher was released
after he had deposited 47 50 on the
clerk's desk.
"Service In the Philippines seems to
be an excellent appetizer," remarked
the Judge to the soldier.
"It is that," was the response. "I
have been in the army thirty-one years,
but I never knew what longing to feed
meant until I went to the islands."
"Who knows," said his Honor, "that
Manila may. not yet become a mecca
for American dyspeptics?"
Frank A. Meyer, accused of attempt
ing to rob a Third-street saloon
keeper, volubly rattled off the history
of his life to Judge Cabaniss.
"I was a brand plucked from the
burning," he said, "when the rum
demon recaptured me and this is the
result. Drink caused my discharge
from the United States navy, where I
was rated a yeoman, and Secretary
McCoy of the Young Men's Christian
Association took me in hand and gave
me charge of the dining-room in the
association's hall. In an evil moment
I met an old shipmate, now aboard
the battleship Ohio, and we cemented
our reunion with liquor. I have no
recollection of committing the offense
here charged against me."
John Thompson, the saloon man, tes
tified that at 3 o'clock yesterday morn
ing he was closing up his place of
business at 236 Third street, and,
while reaching up to turn out a gas
light, he was struck on the jaw by
the defendant, who then grabbed his
watch chain and ran. Patrolman
J. J. Cameron overtook and arrested
the fugitive, who pretended to be more
drunk than his speed as a sprinter had
indicated.
The case was continued until Secre
tary McCoy could be communicated
with.
Philip Kratz was stealing out of the
rear entrance of a dwelling on Mission
street, between Sixth and Seventh,
when Patrolmen P. O. Driscoll and J.
F. Rooney saw him and concluded it
was their duty to investigate. They did
so, and were rewarded by finding the
lower section of his face covered by a
misfit beard, apparently of home man
ufacture. It was Svengali-like in both
shape and color, and attached to his
chin by means of a string encircling his
head. When it was removed the offi
cers recognized Mr. Kratz as a man
whom they had been notified to ar
rest, the complainants being the per
sons who occupied the house from
which he had just emerged.
In the court of Judge Fritz it was
said that Mr. Kratz had been a lodger
in the house until his infatuation for
the daughter, an invalid, became so an-
Doying to her and fter parents that he
was forced to vacate. Then he loitered
around the premises, endeavoring to
communicate with the sick girl, until
the police were requested to suppress
him. They warned him that he would
be arrested if they again found him
in the vicinity, and not until a month
later was he captured as hereinbefore
described.
Very miserable did Mr. Kratz look as
he heard his misdemeanor recited be
fore Judge Fritz. He had gone to Los
Angeles, he said, with intent to live
down his unrequited love, but at the
end of a month the flame burned more
furiously than ever, and he felt that
hf- must either gaze once more on the
face of his inamorata or perish in the
attempt. It was for the purpose of de
ceiving the police that he made and
donned the whiskers, and he safely
passed the picket and entered the
house, only to discover that she whom
he had come so many miles to look
at was confined to her apartment by
Illness. If the policemen had not seen
him and suspected he would have es
caped, for the relatives of the patient
had not penetrated his disguise.
The charge against Mr. Kratz was
peace disturbance, and the Judge or
dered his detention in custody until an
exploration of the statutes can be made
to ascertain if an additional accusa
tion of wearing false whiskers cannot
i be entered with some assurance that
it shall adhere. The young woman in
the case is a consumptive.

GAS STORY
STIRS IRE
OF MANY
Allegations of Bribery and
General Corruption Arouse
Supervisors and Company
to Strong Denunciations
EEPOBT OF GRAND
JURY'S WORK FALSE
Boxton Writes a Letter to
Foreman Andrews De
manding an Investigation
of Charges by Inquisitors
The Supervisors accused of soliciting
a bribe from the gas company and the
officials of the lighting corporation
spent the greater part of yesterday
making denials of the story that some
of the municipal legislators had ex
pressed a desire to be corrupted. Two
or three members of the Grand Jury
heard the rumor early in January, but
it is not probable that the inquisitorial
body will investigate the matter in
view of the absence of J. F. Lawless,
formerly general manager of the gas
company.
Some of the accused officials promise
to make it hot for those responsible
for the story. There seems to be little
prospect that any fire will be discover
ed unless Mr. Lawless returns to fan
away the smoke. Early in the history
of the present Grand Jury a charge
â was made that certain members of the
Board of Supervisors had solicited a
bribe of $2500 from the gas company
in consideration of a promise to vote
for a high lighting rate. The docu
ment containing the accusation was
filed, and in the regular course of work
was opened about ten days ago. It ap
peared that ex-General Manager Law
less was responsible for the original
story. Inquiry developed the fact that
he was some thousands of miles away
from San Francisco and that his testi
mony unsubstantiated would never
warrant an indictment.
The Supervisors who are understood
to have been charged with soliciting a
bribe about a year ago are Bent. Box
ton, Lunstedt, Alpers and Finn. The
last named has since resigned from the
Board of Supervisors and been ap
pointed to the Fire Commission. 1
Supervisors Rea and Eggers, who
were announced as members of a
crowd of blackmailers, have an excel
lent opportunity to seek redress-
BOURN .MARKS DENIAL.
The officials of the gas company held
a meeting yesterday morning and
President Bourn was authorized to
make the following statement:
Referring to an article In the Kxaminer
nf to-day regarding the adoption of gas rates
by the Supervisors in the year ISM>4; This
article attempts to create two impression*
viz: il) That the San Francisco CJas and
Kiectric Company employed corrupt means to
procure the passage uf the gas rate, and (2)
that certain of the Supervisors offered to scli
their votes.
engage In politics, either directly or indirectly,
and would not use or employ or expend one
dollar for political influence. Thin policy has
tM i r scrupulously observed. Neither the com
pany nor any one acting for it has ever used
a i-tnt to influence the action of any public
oflicer.
: It: December. 1003.. 1 went -to Europe, re
turning' February. l!t04. While absent I did
mn receive from Mr. Lawless.- at that time
manager of the San - Francis-. > Gas and Elec
tric Company , or any one else, any cable or
any message of any kind to .the effect that
a satisfactory :or more - than satisfactory rate
could be secured ; by the use of money, nor
dlv :I receive any message whatever on the
subject "of. rates, except a telegram from Mr,
Lawless while I was in New . York" in Feb
ruary.- asking If the company would be satis
fled to have the BuptlVtson fix. a. rate of $1
per 1000 cable feet. ; My : pressnt" recollection
is that I replied that a. rate of $1 10; would
be 'fair, and in subsequent proceedings before
the r board the company .endeavored to obtain
that rat'-. This was the . only message 1 . sent
during my absence on the subject of gas rates.
With reference to t-^e second: Mr. kawies-s
never stated to me that thf Supervisors named
in the article cnVred to vote for a one dollar
rate or any other rate. I have absolutely
no personal knowledge of the subject, nor do
I know if it Is a subject of investigation be
fore the Grand Jury. No member of the
Hoard of BuperriNor* has ever approached mr
on the subject of gas rates.
SPEAKS ONLY FOR HIMSFXF.
It may be noted in Mr. Bourn's state- \
ment that he does not say that Gen
eral Manager Lawless did not report
thf matter to the board of directors of
the gas I'omnany or that some other
equally qualified official of the corpora
tion did not impart the information to
the concerns president. In answer to
queries on this suhject Mr. Bourn says:
"I have nothing further to state."
The accused Supervisors gave vent
to such loud explosions of wrath that
they brought on a rain "last night. Gen
eral Manager Pollok of the gas com
pany has promised to come before the
Board of Supervisors Monday and deny
the story.
The accused officials were in com
munication with President Bourn and
General Manager Pollok yesterday
morning, and the result of their tete
a-tete and telephone conferences was
a decision to prove that the story of
alleged corruption was an out and out
falsehood. Foreman Andrews said
that the matter came before the Grand
Jury as a result of gossip at a club, of
which Mr. Bourn is a prominent mem
ber. It is assured that nothing will
come of the matter unless Lawless is
located and induced to come to San
Francisco as a prosecuting witness.
The five Supervisors whose names
have be<Mi mentioned in connection
with attempting to solicit bribes from
the gas company were highly indig
nant, excited and full of wrath yester
day. Some threatened libel proceed
ings, others demanded an immediate
investigation, while others smiled and
seemed willing to let events take their
course.
POL.LOK SPEAKS TO BENT.
Supervisor Fred Bent is bitter in his
criticism of what he considers an un
just and cowardly proceeding. He
wants an immediate Investigation and
demands that his name be cleared from
all shadow of doubt in the so-called
crooked work. Bent made the follow
ing statement:
Mr. Pollok of the gas company m^t m&
this morning and informed me that the of-
Ikials of the eompÃnj- would go before the
Supervisors on Monday morning- and have this
matter thoroughly aired. This roast Is un
called for, but that is the thanfes a man gets>
when h* 1 works hard to do the people a good
turn. I was one of the members who fousht
the gas company every inch of the way and
was even discussed by the Afro-Amer
iran contingent at Emeryville, where
it finally reached the ears and aroused
the wrath of Mr. West. It was with a
view to preventing actual scandal that
Mr. West crossed the bay and visited
Miss Payne on the evening of the al
leged assault. She says that after
chiding her frailty he smote her be
tween the eyes with, a clenched fist.
He will be sentenced for both bat
tery and vagrancy.

Supervisor Finn said:
I take the same stand as Eent in this mat
ter. I was a member of that committee at
the time and I know that we all worked hard
to secure the low gas rate. But this matter
Is simply rot. It is the hue and cry of somÂ»

take any stock in such a story, for it is too

dress in the courts. He was not a mem
ber of the committee on lighting at the
time and his name was mentioned
through ignorance or malice. Rea said:
I do not see how they got my name mixed
up In this affair. I was not a member of that
committee at the time of the alleged scandal,
and I know absolutely nothing about the affair.
I feel that I have been wronged, though the
charge is absolutely without foundation. The
mention of my name was the rankest kind of,
a blunder.
Eggers is also sore over the affair,
and believes he is the victim of some
sort of a conspiracy. He says the
whole thing is an outrage and a dot,
and absolutely devoid of truth. Al
pers and Lunstedt voice the senti
ments of the others whose names are
mentioned in connection with the af
fair, and both feel they have been
wronged by some unscrupulous Der
son who has a grievance against the
board.
COURTS INVESTIGATION.
Supervisor Boxton has addressed
the following letter to the foreman of
the Grand Jury:
SAN FRANCISCO, March 23. 1905.
Hon. Thomas P. Andrews, Foreman of the
County Grand Jury â Dear Sir: Presuming that
you arc cognizant of this morning's newspaper
publication relating to alleged bribery in the
Hoard of Supervisors in connection with the
regulation of gas rates. I wish to inform you
that it is my earnest desire and respectful de
mand that you and your fellow grand Jurors
immediately take up such newspaper allega
tions lor searching investigation.
To the public official whose course has been
guided only by the dictates of an honest con
science accusations of this character muse
weigh heavily on his peace of mind, and you
will perhaps appreciate my motive in asking
f< r. bay, in^Uting, thnt my connection with
the recent sas rate ordinance be given as
early an inquiry as it is poasJtbU for your hon
orable body to give.
At best the life of a public official who is
placed between the contentions of a burdened
people and a grasping corporation is not a
pleasant one, but when malicious influences
seek to cast cdlum on the man who has solely
don* his duty I think 1 am justified In urging
a speedy investigation. .
You will recall, perhaps, that corporation
punishment is ever ready for Infliction on those
who run counter to coroorate wealth and that
many an honest man's' honest action has been
so distorted and twistr-d until it Is falsely
made to resemble a public crime.
My entire private life and my career as a
public official for the past six years will b-ar
the strictest scrutiny, and to those whn con
strue my vote fcr 80-CBnt gas as a retaliation
tot failure to receive a bribe I make emphat
ic denial, of the charge ami will offer every
facility for a rigid examination
THINKS RATF IS JUST.
statistics have shown that illuminating gas
can b? manufactured and profitably delivered
at" 75 cents i>er hkm) feet, and. after a reason
able valuation of the property of th- San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company. I con
sidered that the U<>-cent rat? was not only fair
to the company, but just to the consumers.
Now as to a vital point. It is stated that
the entire knowledge of this so-called conspir
acy Is in the possession of J. K. Lawless, for
merly manager of the company, who is now
at some unknown place abroad, and that his
presence is necessary in order to secure indlct
n-.ontÃ of the officials alleged to be under sus
picion.
If you will permit m* 1 , Mr. Foreman, I
would suggest that you at once take steps to
secure the attendance of Mr. Lawless before
jrOMr honorably body. I do not presume that
there are legal means of bringing him to San
Francisco should he b? reluctant to come, but
unquestionably there are moral reasons why
he should return, either to clear the cloud of
suspicion from wrongfully accused men or to
bring punishment to the Kuilty.
We will concede that rr. B. Bourn is a law
abiding citizen, whos? sole desire, apart from
increasing thÂ« income of his company. Is to
maintain the purity and holiness of public of
ficials. He Is quoted as declaring that Mr.
Lawless would be the most important witness
in this alleged conspiracy to secure bribes.
Now, Mr. Andrews. I ask that you su,mmon
Mr. Bourn before the Grand Jury and endeavor
to obtain from him all the knowledge neces
sary concerning the location of Mr. Lawless,
and that Mr. Bourn be pledged to urge the re
turn of Mr. Lawless.
Mr. Bourn, as a public citizen, owes this to
the community.
By implication he has made charges against
fiv<Â» Supervisors and it devolves upon him to
sustain them. To sustain them he needs Sir.
I,aw!<>ss. It is declared, and n<-> means should

INDICTED MAN
STILL AT DESK
In spite of the fact that Frank A.
Maestretti, president of the Board of
Public Works, was Indicted by the
Grand Jury on a charge of subornation
of perjury, he still holds hlo office. Yes
terday he was at his desk bright and
early. He remained at his post all day
long aand did not appear â¢ worried
about the future.
Mayor Schmitz has taken no stepÂ«
toward removing the president of the
Board of Public Works from office. It
was thought by â some that the chiej ex
ecutive would suspend Maestretti pend
ing the investigation of his case, but
such was not the situation. The Mayor
says he has no power to remove the
indicted officer, and it is likely that
Maestretti will continue to act as pres
ident of the board, as if nothing had
happened.
Maestretti greeted his friends and the
office force cordially when he entered
the office yesterday morning. He did
not appear to be in the least disturbed
over i.he situation, and went ahead
with the business of the office without
interruption.
Maestretti was visibly amused when
he heard that the names of five mem
bers of the Board of Supervisors were
mentioned In connection with the gas
company scandal.
"Well, I am not the only official who
is having his troubles," laughed the
president of the Works Board. "It be
gins to look interesting for some of the
others and it may be serious. I have
nothing in particular to say about my
case. I will repeat that I have been
wronged and made the victim of a
conspiracy. There is no evidence
against me, and I am fully convinced
I can prove my innocence when the
case comes up for its hearing in the
Superior Court."
The Grand Jury did not meet yester
day, consequently nothing more of the
sensational order was sprung in the
indictment case. Both sides will make
a strong tight, and it Is expected that
the trial will cause not a little excite
ment in political circles. Judge Lawlor
has the case on his calendar for to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
