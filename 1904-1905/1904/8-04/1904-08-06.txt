"Free educational facilities, while a
great benefit to American boys, do not
fit them for life on the sea. Educated
men are needed to direct the work, but
not to perform it, and it'is this condi
tion that results in foreigners filling
the positions on shipboard ' that many
believe should be held in reserve for
Americans.' ,.'.'.
"Regarding these good American
crews of which you hear politicians
say so much, I have something to say:
On one of our vessels, 'out of a crew of
fifty-one men, there were but two men
that could splice or knot a rope, and
these were not Americans. The per
centage of Americans that sail before
the mast is deplorably small. I realize
that something must .be done for the
American boy, but this cannot be done
on the big lirtfcrs. Our captains have
tried in every way to aid young Ameri
cans that went to sea on' our ships, but
their efforts usually resulted in failure.
They arc hard to discipline, ' and in
clerical capacities they proved inac
curate.
"Opportunities should be given for the
American boy to go to sea, but first he
should be given independent training
on a ship devoted to that purpose. The
youth must have a square-rigged ship
on which to learn the art of navigation.
This plan is now being successfully
carried out by the Hamburg- American
Line, under subsidy of the German
Government. â¢
"We have the nucleus for a training
fleet in the ship St. Mary of New
York. Every large coast city should
have one of these training- vessels, | the
course of â¢ study | thereon being fixed at
three years. ' If ; the Government In
sists on training lads on mail ships it
is going to defeat its own purpose. : It
would be better to reduce any ; pur
posed subsidy, and turn the difference
into the support of such nautical
stitutions. â¢
"There are thousands of American
young men that would be as glad to

HARTFORD, Conn.; Aug. 6.â Henry
Osborne, a former Police Commissioner

negro was found to-night hiding under
a bed in the basement of the Osborne

the murderer was found a thousand
persons were gathered and as Watson
was escorted down the steps to the pa

cries of "Kill him! Lynch him:" but
no violence other than of voice was at

Watson, who is 18 years of age and
very unprepossessing in appearance,
did not quail when face to face with
the shouting crowd.

A strong advocate of subsidyâpro

R. P. Schwerin, president of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, who was
first called yesterday morning to pre
sent his views to the commission.
Schwerin began his address by stating
frankly that he had no philanthropic
ideas about the. transportation business.
He believed, he said, in running a
steamship line to; make all the money
possible out of it for the stockholders.
Referring to the rapid rise of the Uni
ted States navy, he said he believed
that the same wise statesmanship ap
plied to the merchant marine would
lift it from its present deplorable con
dition to one of prosperity. Continuing
he said In part:
"The fundamental principle in the
transportation business Is economy of
operation. Protection has raised the
American laborer to practically a mid
dle class position, and it is well, gener
ally speaking, . that this Is so, but It

PROPHESIES IMPROVEMENT.
The Merchant Marine Commission of
Congress has completed its labors in
San Francisco. Shortly after 5 o'clock
last evening Senator Gallinger and
Representatives Minor, Splght and
Humphrey, who compose the commis
sion, announced that, from the stand
point of the Pacific Coast, the question
at issueâ the expansion of the American
merchant marine â had been exhaust
ively discussed, and that the members
of the commission 'would not meet
again as a body until they return to
the national capital.
Facts developed during the session of
the commission here demonstrate that
a palsy is upon the American merchant
marine that demands drastic remedies.
A mass of testimony was presented by
the many men that appeared before the
commission during its sessions in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce,
and the advice given covered a wide
range of thought. Among the' most
prominent of the local shipping and
commercial men that appeared, the
opinion is shared that subsidy in some
form or another would be the tonic to
revitalize the dying merchant marine
of the United States.

test with President Castro against the

The receiver of the Government is said
to be supported by two Venezuela war

pany's property.

This would defeat, the. very end .cf
such a. measure. What we want m/*~t
is tramp ships .and under the . Â«v
they should be given opportunity to
take labor wherever it is the cheapen'..
Get the ships first, .no matter, who
mans them, and eventually opportuni
ties will grow until enough American
boys will enter the tarvice to man all
the vessels flying the American flag.
, "I have thought of many ways by
which the Government might assist
the American marine, but all of them
are surrounded by difficulties that are
hard to evade. I believe, however, that
the Government should lend it% aid pri
marily, to direct mall routes, the ships
of which are so constructed that they
would be of ' immediate use to the
Government in time of need. This
would not only aid the American mer
chant marine, but would be a profit
able investment for the Government."
In this connection Schwerin referred
to those, subsidized ships flying the
Japanese j flag that have been takeh
over by the Nippon Government and
are now operating before the besieged
ports of . Manchuria. Continuing, he
said: - .
"As to the tramp ships the bill
should be so framed that' they will be
assisted when they carry cargoes from
ports at which none of the regular
mail liners touch.: One class of ships
should not be brought into competi
tion with the other. Such a condition
would send the tramp ship where it is
wanted most. They would then s\sek
ports that could not be served by the
regular -line. However, I do not be
lieve that this committee nor any Con
gressional committee can frame. a bill
that will do -away with the existing

would . be readily convertible into

Without making any formal an

a satisfactory settlement be made.
Cable .orders were to-day sent to Rear

At the same time Secretary Hay in

No concealment is made of the

Leishman, on last Friday, had suc

the Sultan. He had sought this Inter

period many new questions had arisen.
He asked the Sultan that American
physicians, dentists and other profes
sional men be given the same privilege
in the Ottoman empire as professional
men from Europe and that the di
plomas of American professional
schools be accepted on the same basi3
as those from European countries. In
addition to this, he made plain the
earnest desire of the United States for
greater protection and liberties for
American religious and educational in
stitutions in Turkey. Lastly, he sug
gested the elevation of diplomatic re

Turkey by the establishment of em

ILL HEALTH OF (THE POPE
CAUSING MUCH ANXIETY
The commission returned to its hear
ing on marine topics at 2:30 o'clock.
The first subject for consideration was
the claim made by various firms that
the Government handling of army
transports costs more than by charter
ing ships of private firms. Major C.
A. Devol, general superintendent . of
army - transports at San * Francisco,
gave some interesting information. He
spoke of the Government's having
given a trial of chartering ships for
the transportation of troops and had
found that with its v own transports the
cost of carrying had been cut in half,
while the carrying capacity of each
ship had been doubled. The companies
owning vessels had also been compelled
to charter other boats to take the place
of those being used by the Govern
ment. To overhaul and prepare steam
ships for the reception and accommo
dation of troops would amount â¢ to so
much that he did not think the steam
ship companies could afford to make
such changes. Without these changes
the carrying of the troops could not
be as well done as under Government
service. All the .transports, with one
exception, were, on a paying basis.
This was brought about by their
freight carrying capacity. The Dlx,
on account of its size, could notjbe used
to bring freight from the Philippines
and was run at a loss until animals
were sent back to America, since
which time the Dlx has very nearly
paid its expenses.
Captain I. E. Thayer, a marine sur
veyor and shipbuilder, spoke at great
length for the system of free ships. He
explained to the commission that Ger
many had built up a magnificent mer
chant marine by constructing ship
yards from the profits derived from
free ships. He advocated this plan
under the plea that it could not pos
sibly make, the situation worse. Here
Senator, Gallinger " interrupted the
speaker by saying that Germany is al
lowing rebates on materials and subsi
dies on ships and practically ignoring
free ships. . Great Britain, he added,
has done ' the same.- Captain Thayer
claimed that Great Britain's ships had
not equaled Germany's on the free ship
plan, but later admitted that he had
repaired a foreign ship, and had Con
gress place it in the coastwise trade
under American register, rather than
having it repaired abroad.
.'Congressman Edward J. Livernash
occupied a few moments by offering
two suggestions. He desired to correct
a misunderstanding at Washington to
the" effect that it was impossible for
white men to: work as stokers in the
tropics. He said that on two lines run
ning from San Francisco to tropical
ports none but white stokers were em
ployed, and that they withstood the
heat as well as did the Asiatics. He
also added that he. wished to file with
in a few days more complete informa
tion-, regarding the sailors' conditions
on much the same idea as covered by
Schwerin at the morning session.

Disastrous Forest Fire.
OLYMPIA, Wash., Aug. 5.â A forest
fire on Thompson Creek, this county,
has burned over five sections of land,
destroying valuable timber, a county
wagon bridge and a farmhouse. The
fire is now under control.
â¢j "I do not attempt to point out what
may be considered an infallible rem
edy and I will say that in my_opinion
you will never find a remedy without
the co-operation of practical shipping
men. I don't believe any cold-blooded
bill can be framed that will relieve the
situation, but I do believe that great
aid could be given by a progressive, not
digressive, subsidy. Capital must be
encouraged and shipyards as well as
ship owners protected and aided."'
The next point touched upon by
Schwerin was In relation to the cost of
building vessels here and in foreign
shipyards. He said the Korea and Si
beria cost his company in round figures
$3,700,000, and there is yet due on them
considerably over $1,000,000. The cost
of the Manchuria and Mongolia was
$4,500,000. No payments have yet been
made on these vessels. These same
vessels could be duplicated in England
for a much less sum, he said, perhaps
30 or 35 per cent less, but had they been
purchased there they would have been
denied American register. Schwerin
gave some further comparisons to show
that no inducements are held out to
shipbuilders to patronize American
yards, and on the question of repairs he
cited an interesting example, saying:
"Not long ago one of our big ships,
the Algoa, ran on the rocks. After she
was floated an examination disclosed
the fact that she needed extensive re
pairs. We advertised for bids. The
lowest bid we received here was $93,000,
while the Victoria, B. C, yard agreed
to do the work for $42,000. It was an
nounced that the great difference was
due not alone to the fact that here the
dockage charge was $30,000, as against
$6000 .in the north, but to the high
wages demanded by the San Francisco
workingmen. After much bickering the
contract was awarded to a local firm,
it agreeing to do the work for the sum
of the Victoria bid plus the estimated
cost of taking the damaged ship to
Seattle.
"It is the exorbitant wages and dock
age charges here that result In great
loss to the American people. It has
been the custom of our company to
have repairs on our trans-Pacific liners
made In Hongkong owing to the labor
situation here, but at the present time
there Is no dock In the Oriental port
large enough to hold our new ships.
We would rather have the cleaning and
painting* of our new ships done in the
Orient, all other things being equal,
becauseâ and' I regret to say itâ the
Chinese laborers do better work than
the Americans." :
Regarding the free ship theory
Schwerin said:
"The difficulties and great expense
that confront those that would build
ships in American yards do not neces
sarily suggest the free ships would be
a remedy for existing evils. I am con
fident that the free ship theory will be
eliminated from the question if an In
creasing, not diminishing, subsidyâ a
subsidy that will increase from year
to year during its term instead of di
minish. .
interesting point He said that at one
time the vessels of the Pacific Mail
fleet were operating under the postal
subsidy act of 1891, but notwithstand
ing the subsidy his company steadily
lost "money and was finally compelled
to cancel its contract with the Gov
ernment, since which time it has made
money. Schwerin explained this ap
parently incongruous state of affairs
bv stating that the mail contracts re
quired the vessels of his fleet to sail
faster than they could under normal
conditions. The result was that they
burned more coal, destroyed more
boilers and broke more machinery
than the Government subsidy covered.
Upon abrogating the contract the
company's vessels returned to normal
conditions, repair and coal bills fell
off and the company was able to make
a profit. Schwerin' commended all of
these points to the commission 1 when
it sits down to write the bill having as
its object the expansion of the Amer
ican merchant marine. In closing on
this point he said that while he fa
vored a general subsidy, the subsidy
should cover the cargo carried and
not the mileage.
Schwerin then went into an interest-
Ing discussion of the comparative cost
of operating vessels uA,der the American
and foreign flags. The statistics pre
sented by him went to show that with
white or European crews, as they are
commonly called, shipped at this port
at the port wages the cost of operating
ships is from two to three times greater
than to operate the same ships with
European crews shipped at foreign
ports and under foreign flags, and
greater again than when operated by
Asiatics. This, he said, would explain
to any reasoning business man why the
Pacific Mail carried Asiatics on its
trans-Pacific lines. The Chinese, he
said, also gave better service than
Europeans in positions not requiring
great strength, and the item of their
maintenance alone resulted in the sav
ing of hundreds of thousands of dollars
a year to his company.

each one of his associate Judges. In
his own room, which he has occupied
so long, he looked out of the window
to the distant hills -across the Hudson.
His voice trembled perceptibly as he
said:
"This room, boys, was mine."
Slight emphasis on the word "was"
gave the first actual indication to re
porters of his Intention to resign.
Returning to the consultation room
he took a long envelope from a pocket

Shaft at Arroyo Grande Sank Four
ABANDONED OIL WELL ,
SUDDENLY BECOMES ACTIVE
Years Ajjo Now a Producing
Property.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Aug. 5.â Word
has just been received here that a well
drilled for oil four years ago by the
Western Union Oil Company at Arroyo
Grande, where oil has never, been de
veloped, has begun flowing. The well
was plugged and abandoned. yThere i3
much excitement over the matter, as
several companies were already or
ganizing to drill.
"On six Government ships building at
the iron works we figure we have lost
$1,200,000 through conditions we could
not control. The exactions of the.Gov
ernmentj.are frequently arbitrary, and
a dispute regarding the ventilation J of
one of the vessels tied up; the work-on
it for. a period of months. : In the end
the Government had: its way, the ven
tilation cost us four times what we cal
culated it would arid now, it, is a failure!
The system we intended to install
would have. been a success."
Schwerin, made a most interesting
statement to the' commission. Mr.
Dickie's great experience in ship build
ing gave his advice an authoritative
stamp and he was intently listened* to
throughout. He confined his address
mainly to the difficulties that confront
American ship builders at the present
time, though in answer to questions
of members of the Congressional Com
mission he widened the scope of his
statements to. cover the free ships and
subsidy questions. In part he said:
"There are three conditions that
combat the builders of ships in the
United States â design, labor and ma
terial, j The great element to be con
tended with by those that wish to com
pete with foreign yards is the cost of
labor. After giving the subject much
study I have determined that the cost
of labor is 65 per cent of the vessel's
worth. In America the wages are 87%
per cent higher than in England. Then
there is much piece work done at set
tled rates and, notwithstanding great
efforts, we have never been able to ac
complish anything in that direction
here. The claim that American work
ingmen are able to produce more than
foreigners in a given unit of time I
have found not to be so.
"The difference in price of material
here is much greater than in England,
though the disparity is not so great
as it is in the matter of labor. There
is only about 28 per cent difference in
the price of woodwork here and there,
but steel can be bought in the foreign
market from American manufacturers
many dollars a ton less than it can at
home. This should not be so, but it
is" and all these elements go. to make
the" cost of 'American built vessels
from 35 to 38 per cent more than
those turned out by foreign yards.
"Whether or not we ever will be
able to compete with these conditions
I am not prepared to say.. The claim
that the difference, in wages and cost
of material is largely balanced by. our
better facilities is not the case.- The
yards of England and Scotland are
fully as well equipped as our own and
as for the tools the foreign ones are
better in â¢ many instances than ours.
As a matter of fact there are certain
kinds we import from- there for use
in our own yards.
"In one of the English yards I saw
a ship there In course of construction
that is almost a duplicate of the
cruiser California, recently launched
at the Union Iron Works. Upon in
vestigation I learned that the steel
that was entering into the construc
tion of that vessel was being pur
chased from the Carnegie Steel Com
pany for a fraction over $35 a ton,
while that we used in the California,
purchased from the same firm, cost
us over $55 a ton. This is an aston
ishing condition brought abput by a
tariff that permits of manipulation.
"Regarding the question of free
ships, I do not believe the American
shipowner can' prosper unless there is
prosperity in ship building. Unless
the ship yards are fostered they can
not exist and if they pass from ex
istence the great amount of repairing
that is daily employing an army of
mechanics could not be done. Re
pairing comes at uncertain times and
to do it properly there must always
be many men subject to immediate
call. These men will not be at hand
unless they are employed in con
struction work. During the idle pe
riods they would drift away.
"I doubt also that many of the
yards would be able to continue if the
matter of naval construction was also
transferred to the Government yards.
In fact, the navy yards are responsi
ble for many of the difficulties, that
confront us. The navy yards give
shorter hours, higher pay and the in
centive of a vacation to men and the
result is that when, they need men
they come to our yards.and take away
our best employes. . When the work
at the navy yards_ slackens these men
are turned out, 'only to again seek
employment of us. As they are good
men we take them back, .and it is the
fact that they know they can get back
that causes them to quit in the first
place. Activity again reaches the navy
yards and they quit again. .Our work
is set back and disorganization fol-i
lows, but this fails to affect the Gov
ernment officials.
"One instance I will recite. We had
some skilled mechanics working on
the gun ports of the battleship Ohio.
The officials of the navy yard at that
time needed some good men and they
came over and took ours away from
the gun ports. We got other men af
ter much difficulty and they were just
getting acquainted with their work
when the navy yard took them away.
Four times this occurred. t We could
only protest;, but our protest was v
without avail. All of this time we
were being penalized for delay.
At this point Senator Perkins, who
had been an interested spectator, rose
and after paying a high compliment to
Dickie requested that he explain more
fully j the methods by .which the navy
yard was taking men away from the
private yards, for, said Senator Per
kins, "the rule of the Government is
that, men in the navy yards shall not
be paid higher wages than is allowed
them in private yards. Dickie explained
that the commission that fixes the
wages paid by the Government, realiz
ing that it must hold out an incentive
to get the very best men, seizes upon
the sum paid some especially responsi
ble employe of the private yard and
uses that as a basis for fixing the wage.
Senator Perkins said he would look into
the affair. He said the same complaint
had come regarding Bremerton j Navy
Yard, and that if the rules of the de
partment were being violated such vio
lation must cease. -f Â¦* ';_.'. '
Dickie advanced the opinion that in
order to expand the American merchant
marine Government aid of some kind
must be giveri^ not only to the ship
owner, but to the shipbuilder. He said
he realized that there was a wide dif
ference of opinion as to the shape the
aid should take, and there were many
diverging interests that . must be har
monized, but he was sure that with
continued study . a solution could be
reached. '--Â¦}Â¦''-''
When. Dickie concluded It was. past
noon and an adjournment was taken.
As the. guests of the Chamber of Com
merce, the members of the commission,
Senator Perkins, Mayor Schmitz and
other distinguished citizens enjoyed
luncheon at the Pacific-Union Club. In

In a statement given out to-night oy
the packers it is asserted that there
v.as a considerable increase in to-day's
business over that of yesterday. The
total number of cattle killed to-day is
placed at S963, while 10,319 hogs and
5207 sheep were slaughtered.
The strikers to-night declared that
the strike from now on would be
All day long hundreds of depositors
Blood in line to withdraw their small
deposits. When closing time came this
afternoon ' a thousand persons were
waiting for their money.
The bank, determined to meet thÂ»
emergency, called in extra tellers and
the place was kept open until every
depositor who presented himself had
been satisfied. The paying windows*
" v. ere closed after 8 o'clock to-night.
Nearly two hours before that time the
last man in line had been paid his de-,
posit in full.
Â¦t It is estimated that more than 3000
depositors called and withdrew their
.deposits during the day. When the run
â¢ was at its height the bank withdrew
$100,000 of its deposit with the Commer
cial'National Bank and a like amount
from the First National Bank in order
to prevent any possibility of the bank
being unable to meet its obligations
promptly.
The Teamsters' Union, the members
of which are on strike, has $2000 on de
posit in the bank, but no effort wa3
made to withdraw this money to-day,,
the secretary of the union declaring
that the money would remain where it
Mas, as the bank was as solid as a
- rock.
CHICAGO, Aug. 5.â The strike in the
X acking-houses had a counter attrac
tion to-day in the excitement attending
a run on the Drovers' Trust and Sav
ings Bank, which Is in the stockyards.
The rush of the depositors to the bank
it^ried farly because of an unfounded
mmor that one of the packers' repre
sentatives had withdrawn his money
Horn the institution and reports thut
the bank was used by the packing com
panies as an adjunct in paying em
ployes who had taken the places of th3
strikers.
At 6 o'clock the labors of the commis
sion ended and Senator Gallinger
spoke as follows:
"In behalf of the commission, I de
sire to express our thanks. I feel I am
safe in saying that no court that we
have^held has been so well attended
nor have such strong arguments been
presented to us as here in San Fran
cisco. We wish to thank Mr. Newhall
and his associates of the Chamber of
Commerce for their courtesy in extend
ing to us the, use of this fine room; also
to President Rolf and President Bab
cock and their associates and to Mr.
Schwerin, for courtesies that we shall
never forget. Nor do v.e forget that
class\of people, those who âa advance
to a great degree our work, or who can
hinder its progress. We wish to" thank
the proprietors and representatives of
the papers of San- Francisco, who have
been diligent followers of the hearing
and have given great space to the argu
ments."
The members of the commission will
leave for their homes in a few days.
To-night they will take a well-earned
rest and Ao-morrow will visit Mount
Tamalpaivas the' guests of Captain I. E.
Thayer. A subcommittee will visit the
South Atlantic and Gulf ports in No
vember, and about the 25th of that
month the entire commission will meet
and formulate its report. This report
will be, before Congress by the first
Monday In December, - aa required by
law. Â¦' - Â¦
Whereas, The past creation of forest re
serves Â¦ ha3 often . been ill-advised and far
reaching and the administration thereof as
concerns the grazing Interests has been faulty
even Â« to injustice, and, believing that the
Department of the Interior Is not fully equipped
to study and handle the forest reserve ques
tion; and.
Whereas, Feeling that thÂ« present grazing
system has been built up through a term of
many years, consuming the life work of the
western pioneers and of ; the younger genera
-tlon, entailing untold hardship and even sac
rifice of life, and believing that such sturdy
efforts entitle the great majority of the present
occupants of the range to no uncertain voice
in the initiation of any legislation that may
affect their Interests; therefore, be it
Resolved. That v/e favor the passage of a
law' which will authorize the Secretary of
Agriculture to thoroughly classify the vacant
lands of the United States and determine the
conditions at present governing the- use of the
grazing areas and to ascertain those sections
of the range area,' If there be any, to which
a lease system can be satisfactorily applied;
and be it further
Resolved. That the power to create and

pose; and be it further
Resolved, That we favor Government con
trol of and Jurisdiction over all public graz

Agriculture; local questions belns decided on
local grounds and under regulations made to
meet local conditions; that the range rights
of present users of the grazing area as de
termined by priority of occupancy and present
use shall be carefully safeguarded, and that
no sudden or stringent upheaval of existing

tress shall be made; on the other hand, such
legislation must be gradual In Its effect and

to combat the statements of Congress
man Llvernash in regard to Chinese
on the ocean steamers. After one or
two efforts to concentrate his ideas he
was prevailed upon to sit down and
subsequently left the room.
A. D. Porter of the Boilermakers' and
Shipbuilders' Union said that the
scarcity of home work on foreign ships
was because the owners were over
charged for all repairs > at American
yards. He said that a vessel could be
docked at Victoria for half the money
required here and that notwithstanding
this fact the wages of the men were
higher in Victoria,
/'A. P. Lorentzen, local representative
of the Victoria Drydock Company, said
this was not so. He then furnished
cause for merriment by describing the
actions of various Government officials
when inspecting his vessel and the de
mands made by some of them. He
said that the pilots secured their po
sitions by influence, and not by com
petitive examination, and that many
ships' masters were more capable of
bringing their vessels into port than
were the harbor pilots. On being told
that this was a State matter, Mr.
Lorentzen suggested that the Govern
ment take the pilot service in charge.
He related that .one of his ships went
to Seattle with nothing but ballast in
the hold and the United States in
spector taxed him $1 a ton on that. He
brought the matter into the courts and
a Seattle Judge decided in his favor.
The Government then appealed the
case direct to the Supreme Court of the
United States. The officials made the
claim that the levying of taxes on
hundreds of other ships was at stake.
Others before the commission were
Joseph R. Oldham, Lionel Heynemann
of the Fulton Jron Works and William
J. Woodside.
DENVER, Aug. 5.â The Western
Stock Growers, who have been confer
ring here for three days with the spe
cial land commission . appointed by
President Roosevelt, finally adjourned
this evening without taking any action
with reference to the strike at the
packing-house centers. A resolution
was adopted with practical unanimity
urging upon Congress "the necessity
of the transfer at the earliest possible
date of the management of the forest
reserves to the Department of Agri
culture, where not only the forests, but
all the interests involved, may be prop
erly studied and protected."
The discussion of the resolutions con
cerning grazing lands' was animated,
there being a strong sentiment in favor
of amending those reported by the
committee so as to urge, the passage
of a strict leasing law for arid lands of
all. States and Territories. As reported
and as finally adopted the resolutions
are as follows:
Whereas. After full discussion In open con
vention, the fact has developed that conditions
over the vast area included in the grazing
districts of the West are so varied and con
flicting that much time must of necessity be
consumed in the classification of- the public
grazing area, as well as the determination of
range customs and usages In diCerent dis
tricts; Â¦ and.
All this took olace while the patient
was unconscious, and as the picture be
came distinct enough for every one in
the ward to see he began to revive.
Soon he was able to sit up in bed, and
by the aid of two mirrors and candles
he was able to the picture on his
back. As soon as he recognized what
it was he fell back upon his pillow,
crying. He declared It was a miracle
that he could not understand. :
MORRISTOWN, N. J., Aug. 5.âDur
ing a jheavy shower this afternoon
Theodore Armstrong of Mount Kemble
avenue after a heavy clap of thunder
ran to his front window and saw a man
lying face downward across the side
walk, with his coat torn from the right
shoulder down to within a few Inches
of the bottom. Armstrong notified All
Souls' Hospital, and when Dr. Griswold
arrived he found the inan unconscious,
with large streaks all over his back.
He was taken to the hospital.
The streaks on the man's back began
to assume the form of a cross, and as
the sisters and the doctors watched the
marvelous transformation the figure
began to grow more distinct, and, soon
the image of Christ nailed to the cross
appeared. The nails in the hands and
feet were there as plainly as if they
had been Dainted. The wtound in the
side could be seen, and upon the head
of Christ appeared a crown of thorns as
distinctly as upon the large crucifix
which hangs directly over the young
man's bed.
Surrounding the cross are streaks
which remind one of lightning striking
In every direction. The cross extends
down the spinal column sixteen inches,
and could not have been placed in (he
center better by artificial means. The
crosspiece to which the figure hangs
extends from one shoulder blade to the
ether. At the foot of the cross are two
large scars, which take the appearance
of rocks.
As the rricture became plainer the
news was spread about the hospital,
and sisters flocked to the bedside to
see what they called a miracle. Dr. J.
B. Grlswald, who attended the man,
said he had never seen such a trans
formation in his many years of prac
tice.

CONDITIONS THAT HANDICAP BUILDERS OF SHIPS CONSTITUTE A STARTLING STORY
THE SAN FRANCISCO , CALL, SATURDAY,^ AUGUST 6 ; 1904.
{ f-T"HERE are three conditions that interfere with builders of ships in the United Statesâ
I design, labor and material. The great element to be contended with by those that wish to i
compete with foreign yards is" the cost of labor. After giving the subject much", study, I
have determined that the cost of labor is 55 per cent of the vessel's worth. In America the .
wages are 87^ per cent greater than in England, and here material is more expensive. Whether
or not we will ever be able to compete with these conditions, 1 am not prepared to say." â Ex
cerpt from statement of George W.Dickie.
"I do not attempt to point out what may be considered an infallible remedy, but I will
sav that, in my opinion, you will never find a remedy without the co-pperation of practical ship
ping men. I don't believe any cold-blooded bill can be framed that will relieve the situation; _
but I do believe that great aid could be given by a progressive, not digressive, subsidy. Cap
ital must be encouraged, and shipyards as well as shipowners protected and aided."â Excerpt

Special Dispatch to Ths Can.
PARIS, Aug. 5. â Zillacus. the well
known Finnish exile and revolutionist,
who is now in this city, corroborates
the report that a secret revolutionary
congress took place at Evian-Les-Balns
just before the assassination of Von
Plehwe. He denies, however, that the
assassin belonged to the organization
which met there.
Zillacus says that the majority who
were present were Russians, but there
were also a number of Finns.
Measures were taken to insure tho
rapid distribution of revolutionary
literature and weapons in Finland and
Russia as soon as Port Arthur falls, or
some other decisive Russian disaster
occurs. This accounts for the presence
in Switzerland of numbers of revolu
tionists, whose arrival has puzzled ths
police.
Zillacus laughs at the Idea that the
police can prevent the consummation
of the revolutionary plan when once
a Russian catastrophe has opened the
eyes of the Finns.
FOUR THOUSAND SLAYS FALI*
Official Statement of Losses In the
Fighting Near Haicheng.
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 5.â Detailed
reports reaching the War Office from
General Kuropatkin's generals show
that the Russian losses on July 30. July
31 and August 1 did not exceed 4000.
The Japanese are believed to have lost
at least an equal number.
The greatest number of casualties
was sustained by General Herschel
mann, who with the Ninth European
division, held Kuchiatzu and Tushu
passes on the Slamatsza road. The
fighting there was of the most desper
ate and bloody character. One regi
ment lost 25 per cent, or 800 men, be
fore it withdrew toward Anplng.
Another point where stubborn resist
ance was made was at Nanga Pass, a
position between Simoucheng and Hai
cheng, which was held by General Zas
sulitch, whÂ» had been placed in com
mand of a newly formed corps, includ
ing the Thirty-first division belonging
to the Tenth European Corps and two
Siberian battalions, altogether 18,000
men. General Zassulitch's misfortune
at the Yalu River was duplicated, ow
ing to the superiority of the Japanese
artillery. He. was making a splendid
fight until he suddenly discovered that
the Japanese gunners were enfilading
his batteries. It appears that General
Zassulitch in this case was not' to
blame. The information that General
Yaronbiarff had. received orders to re
tire had not yet reached him be
fore orders for the withdrawal of the
Russian support of the right, and con
sequently he allowed the Japanese to
take up a new position, suddenly un
mask batteries and overwhelm the
Russian gunners, who made desperate
efforts to remove their pieces, but were
compelled to leave six of them behind.
BURYING RUSSIAN DEAD.
Japanese Find Seven Hundred Bodies
on Simouchens Battle Ground.
TOKIO, Aug. 5. â It is now estimated
that the Russians lost 2000 men in
the fighting at Simoucheng. The
Japanese Sanitary Corps recover^*
and buried 700 bodies in th'e valleys
through which the Russians fought
and retreated. Prisoners and Chinese
report that many of the Russian dead
and wounded were removed by the
Russians themselves. The Japanese
captured six guns. 57 0 shells, a quan
tity of stores and thirty-three prison
ers. A detachment of the Russian
Medical Corps, which was captured
by the Japanese, was returned to the
Russian lines. The Japanese casual
ties at Simoucheng totaled 860 men.
including eight officers killed and
twenty-four officers wounded." H M
CHEFU, Aug. 5. â Thirty more refu
gees arrived to-day on junks from
Port Arthur, which place they left on
August 1. The departure of all civil
ians from Port Arthur is said to bo
owing to the exhaustive preparations
for a final stand against the Japanese.

Russian Admirals Are
Ordered Not to Sink
Prize Ships.
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 5. â That
some of the insurance written on parts
of the cargo of the China liner Arabia
may not be paid without a fight on the
part of the companies issuing poli
cies, or will not be paid at all, seems
probable as a result of developments
to-day. It is learned that policies
were written on freight the day fol
lowing the capture of the steamship.
This is no reflection upon the shippers,
but may afford grounds for a refusal
to pay the policies.
The Arabia was seized on Friday,
July 22, and late on that day cable
advices were received in this city re
porting rumors that the Russian
Vladivostok squadron had captured
the vessel. On the strength of these
rumors certain portions of her cargo
which had not been insured at the
time of her departure from this port
were covered by war risks. The vessel
having actually been seized at the time
the war risks were taken out, the in
surance companies do not feel obligated
to pay the risks and will fight the case
in the courts.
Policies Written on Arabia's Cargo
After the Ship Ware Seized.
INSURANCE MAY NOT BE PAID.
The number of sunstrokes wag great.
To add still further to the misery of
the men, the water in their canteens
soon became exhausted and the springs
were nearly all dried up by the torrid
heat. Surgeon Kerenitvlch said it was
actually so hot that some of his men
burned their hands on the brass but
tons and buckles of the soldiers as
they undressed the ' wounded. Only
when night fell did the troops get any
relief. The wounded were loaded into
Red Cross cars which had been
especially arranged for this purpose at
Haichenc.
The correspondent mentions that the
One Hundred and Thirty-seventh Regi
ment, belonging to the Thirty-first Di
vision of the Seventeenth Army Corps,
was engaged Jn this fight. This is the
first definite information that any of
the troops of the Seventeenth Army
Corps were on the firing lfne.
In addition to the terrific heat of the
day and of the battle the correspond
ent says that the Russian soldiers suf
fered dreadfully because they were
obliged to carry their heavy overcoats
and equipments. '"
Some of the infantry had to cut their
way out at enormous sacrifice. . One
company lost all its officers and most
of its men. ." . v-
The Japanese swarmed into the Bar
naols* trenches, coming so close that
the Russians actually wrenched the
guns from their hands, clubbing the
Japanese with their own rifles.
The correspondent could detect the
movements of the enemy thiough the
fit-Id hy the small clouds of dust which
were raise..! when the crisis came, as
the Japanese batteries enfiladed the
Ttiissian gunners. Then the older was
given to retire, and Major General
Mistchenko's cavalry, a brigade of ar
tillery and the Barnaol regiment cov
ered the retreat.
From an eminence on which he stood
the correspondent could see down to
the westward plantations of waving
kaolin, the crown of which was so high
that squadrons of Japanese cavalry
wended thtir '.\ay within a quarter of
a mile of ths Russian cavalry, neither
Fidfe suspecting the proximity of the
other.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 6.â A Rus
sian correspondent of the Associated
Press, describing the general Japanese
advance of last Sunday east of Liao
yang, says that one of the Japanese
columns, taking advantage of the com
plicated network of mountain paths
and deep gorges, actually crept around
the rear of the Russian position before
being discovered.
He explains this by saying that the
topography of the country is so com
plicated and seamed with ravines that
two hostile armies might be within the
space of a half-mile without suspecting
each other's presence.
In describing the fightinp; around
Simouchcnc the correspondent paints a
picture of soldiers fighting all day long
in the stifling dust and the torrid htat.
BERLIN, Aug. 5.â The National
Zeitung prints a private telegram from
Tokio, dated August 5, In which it is
said that there are five Japanese divi
sions before Port Arthur, part of them
within three and a half miles of the
fortress, and that there are altogether
twenty divisions in Manchuria.
The telegram says that Tokio is ex
pecting the fall of Port Arthur and the
capitulation of General Kuropatkin on
the same day.
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 5.â What is

PERSOXAL.
It would be absolutely ineffective if other
wise lawful and valid for the reason that the
prohibited districts are not defined by limiting
boundaries. According to the proposed amend
ment the attempted boundary line of the
"quarry" district begins either at Van Ness
avenue and Market street or at Van Ness
avenue and Bay street (It is uncertain which)
and ends at the waters of the bay and Green
street, leaving the space between Van Ness
avenue and East street open and without
boundary thus falling to define a district.
Among the attempted boundaries of the
"rock-cmshlng" district are two parallel
streets without connection, Lombard and
Greenwich streets, â¢ thus leaving that district
oper. and unbounded. The proposed amend
ment Is wanting of definition and therefore
ineffective.
The proposed amendment is inconsistent and
in my opinion Illegal In that it assumes to
grant power to the Supervisors to fix the limits
and at the same time assumes itself to fix
such limits.
The proposed amendment is. In my opinion,
unconstitutional. -It is Justifiable only as an
exercise of the "police power" of the munlclp-
Amendment No. 3 seeks to fix the
limits for quarrying and is supposedly
aimed at Gray Bros. The Mayor says:
WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE.
pervlsors the unlimited control of the expendi
tures of public utilties as against the depart
ments under whose Jurisdiction the framers
of the charter Intended that such expendi
tures should be made.
The first of these objects the proposed
amendment would fall to achieve, because Its
language refers to the wrong aectlons of the
charter. The amendment reads: "The pro
visions Of section 0 of this chapter shall not
apply to the funds of any publlo utility or
appropriation made therefrom.'
Section 0 can relate only to Article XII,
when, as a matter of fact, the author of the
amendment undoubtedly had In mind section
9 of chapter I of Article III of the charter,
which is nowhere In the proposed amendment
mentioned or referred to.
The second of these objects would. If the
proposed amendment became a part of the
charter, put the responsibility for the opera
tion of any pubic utility upon one of the mu
nicipal departments, and yet allow the Board
of Supervisors to cripple Its efficiency or de
etroy its utility, as has been. In my opinion,
attempted by this very board In Its controversy
with the Board of Health an arm of the mu
nicipal administration which has honestly,
efficiently and economically administered its
department. â¢
This amendment, if carried, would also. In
my Judgment, provide a basis for a strong
argument against the acquisition of any public
utilities as It expressly provides for the un
profitable operation of such utilities and pre
pares for an attack by the Board of Super
visors upon the general funds of the city,
raised by general taxation of her citizens, to
replenish the funds of a possibly unprofitable
public utility-
The language of the amendment in this
connection Is as follows: 'Should the reserve
funds be Insufficient to pay the eame, then
the Board of Supervisors may appropriate
from the general fund of the oity, and county
a sum sufficient to meet such deficiency."
As the city has not yet acquired any public
utility there will be ample time and oppor
tunity hereafter for the submission of an im
proved amendment, if one should be deemed
necessary.
In view of the decision of Police
Judge Cabaniss yesterday that In pool
selling cases it Is necessary in order to
secure a conviction to prove that the
race on which the bet was made took
place, Chief Wittman will ask that an
amendment be made to the existing
poolselling ordinance. -
Frank â¢ McDonald and D. Crelghton
were arrested by Policeman Peshon on
Thursday after he had laid a wager of
60 cents with McDonald & Creighton
on a horse which was to run In a race
on a track in New York. The Judge
dismissed the cases, holding that there
was no proof that the horse ran In the
race or that the race was run.
The ordinance provides that It shall
be unlawful to make "any bet or wager
whereby money . or other representa
tives of value are staked or pledged on
races or other contests between horses,
except within the inclosure of a race
track."
Chief Wittman said in referring to
Judge Cabaniss' decision that It would
take about $400 to bring witnesses from
the East to prove that the horse ran or
that the race was run. "I will send,"
said the Chief, "a communication to
the Board of Police Commissioners
calling their attention to the matter
and recommending that an amendment
be made to the ordinance. The amend
ment I would suggest will be In adding
after the word 'contests* the words
â¢purporting or understood to be run.'
The matter will be taken up at the
next meeting of the board, on Tuesday
night, and I will urge that It be pushed
through without delay, as my hands
are now practically tied."
Judge Cabaniss in speaking of his de
cision said It would not Interfere with
the local races, as the facts here could
be easily proved.
SPELL OF READING
IN RAWHIDE CASE
Chief Wi'ttman has put himself
squarely on record as favoring a highSr
license rate for local saloons.
A large numb:r of citizens attended
a meeting last night at the Columbian
building, at 91S Market street, with ref
erence to the suggested liquor dealers'
high license. J. W. Scott was in the
chair and among the speakers were
John F. Merrill, J. W. Hatch, D. No
land, P. F. Morris and others represent
ing various business industries and
trades.
Besides the commercial interests rep
resented there were delegates from the
Epworth League Alliance and the Gold
en Gate Christian Endeavor Union. N.
B. Greensfelder and Leon C. Osteyee
represented the Civic Council of San
Francisco.
Merrill made some practical sugges
tions as to the means which he consid
ered necessary to obtain names to the
petition, which must be in the hands of
the Registrar of Voters by the end of
September. Merrill could not see why
the petition should not contain 30,000
names. He expressed his confidence
that nine-tenths of the business men of
the city would sign the petition. That
there shall be no time iQSt In furthering
the movement by which those interest
ed hope to institute high license In San
Francisco, he moved to district the
business portion of the city as a prac
tical m*ans of gaining signatures. The
motion Ivas adopted.
The following letter in response to an
invitation to attend a former meeting
was read from Chief of Police Witt
man:
Dear Sir: I am, as you know. In hearty
accord with you in striving to obtain the
ends for which the meeting was called. I
found during my trip throughout the Eastern
States that there are no cities that have a
lower license rate for the retail liquor business
than $500 per annum, and they grade from
that amount up to $1500 per annum. I was
laughed at by the different Chiefs of Police
and the Mayors of the different cities where
I visited when I told them that our retail
liquor dealer's license was only $84 a year.
I think the public Is ripe for a reform In
this direction and only needs some one to
bring the matter publicly to the attention of
the community. I am sure you will flnd that
the public will vote right on the question.
There will be a meeting at the same
place next Friday evening at 8 o'clock.

EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST.
This instrument wag framed with great care,
and much de.' Iteration and was proudly pro
claimed, even by some of those who now seek
to amend it, as a monument of municipal wis
dom tCKS of municipal government.
It is true that the charter is imperfect in
many particulars, but in my - opinion the
amendments are not directed at the most im
portant of these particulars.
It would be far more advantageous to the
city and to the economical administration of
its affairs, if. instead of seeking further to
extend the power of the Board of Supervisors
unfairly and unjustly to interfere with and
cripple the operations of the various depart
ments and bureaus of the city's government,
thereby precipitating expensive and disagree
able conflicts at the coet of the citizens of
San Francisco, an amendment were offered
providing for the autonomy of each depart
ment and its own control, over the work for
which It is responsible and over wliich it has
under the charter exclusive control.
A majority. If not all. of the amendments
proposed by the Supervisors, this day returned
by me. are designed to increase the already
exaggerated power assumed and claimed by
the Board of Supervisors.
Moreover, thla wholesale tinkering with the
charter is fraught with serious consequences.
On account of the ill-considered haste In which
the*? amendments are conceived and prepared
it is also dangerous, not only to the subjects at
which they may be aimed, but to the re
mainder of the charter.
I Unless in some manner restrained. It is evi
dent that the people of this city are apt to be
aifllcted with a charter amending epidemic.
The Board of Supervisors has, to this date,
already proposed six amendments and has oth
ers in contemplation, while petitions are being
freely circulated for the submission to the peo
ple of other amendments.
t>o many amendments submitted at a single
election, and that, too, one which Involves
national party issues and in which candidates
for public office are to be elected, will, 1 am
sure, fail to receive that consideration which
the importance i>( such changes in the funda
mental organic law of the municipality merits
and should have.
To the Board of Supervisors â Gentlemen: I
herewith return, without my approval, and I
hereby disapprove and veto, "Charter Amend
ment No. 2" and specify the following as the
reasons tor my veto:
The veto messages are as follows:
VIGOROUS OBJECTIONS.
Mayor Schmtt* has returned to tho
Board of Supervisors without his. ap
proval live of the six purposed amend
ments to th9 charter. In his veto
ini'.-sajce the Mayor does not enter into
lengthy legal, argument or quote de
cisions. Flatiy, bluntly he states his
refusal. Caustically he takes a fling
at the Supervisors, whom he accuses
of attempting to arrogate to them
selves power's which belong to other
branches of the city government and
increase their powers.
He says that the charter Is not the
most perfect document in existence,
but holds that the Supervisors are
barking up the wrong tree and that the
amendments are not aimed at the im
perfect sections.
Some of the purposed amendments
Eeem not only to ha.ve met with the dis
approval of the city's chief executive,
but also to ha\e aroused his ire. Re
garding amendment No. 6, which . re
lates to the duties of the Fire Commis
sioners, the Mayor says that the Su
pervisors, in reaching out for more
power, do not care what chaotic condi
tions may be brought about or how
the administration may be impaired.
SNOW CAUSES GOLDMAN'S
ARREST FOR INSANITY
This amendment would remove from the
Fire Commissioners the duty, as well as the
right, to supervise the business of the depart
ment for which they are responsible and of
which they have exclusive control. It would
expressly absolve them from seeing that con
tracts awarded and work done for the Fire
Department should be faithfully performed and
would release them from the obligation of ex
acting adequate bonds for the prompt and
faithful performance of the same.
In the grasping for more power for the Su
pervisors, it matters not apparently what cha
otic conditions may be brought about nor how
seriously the efficiency of municipal adminis
tration may be impaired. The houses of the
city may be burned, conflagrations may rage
and destroy our places of business for want of
proper control by the Fire Department of its
horses, apparatus and supplies, but If small
political grievances or petty political ambi
tions can be satisfied, let the charter be
amended.
The purposed amendment No. 6, aim
ed at the Fire Commission, meets with
the Mayor's disapproval as follows:
This amendment I consider most vicious and
most dangerous to the city's interests. It
atempts to authorize progressive payments on
public contracts. It must have been plain to
the gentlemen who proposed this amendment,
experienced as they are in municipal affairs,
that such an amendment would only place a
premium on spoliation of this city through
financially irresponsible contractors. A low
figure could be bid on & contract, part of the
work dons, progress payments made and the
work thereupon abandoned, to be completed
by the city on a much higher basis of ex
pense. Contract Jobbery should not be en
couraged.
FIRE COMMISSION'.
The veto of the purposed amendment
No. 5, relating to payments on street
contracts, is brief. It says:
STREET CONTRACTS.
ABROGATION OF POWER.
To the purposed ' amendment \ No. 4
the following objections are made by
the Mayor:
It Is a direct arrogation of certain power to
the Supervisors which the charter makers did
not contemplate or intend. It Is an Interfer
ence with the action, of a municipal depart
ment which Is primarily and legally responsible
for work upon the streets and would . tend to
create unnecessary conflict between two de
partments â¢ of municipal administration.
It would impose upon property owners the
burden, already arduous enough, of dancing
attendance upon committees of the Board of
Supervisors and at meetings of thÂ« Supervis
ors, as well as waltlnc upon the Board of
Publlo Works, to secure permission to do what
under proper regulation and supervision it
would seem they should have every right to
do, namely, in proper cases, to improve their
own property at their own expense.
As the ballots, voted by the people contain
only the briefest reference to the nature of
the amendment voted on it will be observed
that the establishment of this precedent might
lead to most noxious and harmful results.
Thus in this amendment a section of the
charter which gives the Supervisors only power
tc construct or permit the construction of tun
ncls Is sought to be amended go as to create
restrictions and prohibitions of matters entirely
foreign.
ity, and Its subject matter la within the
Jurisdiction of tne lawmaklng power.
The lawmaking power already existing in
the legislative authority of the city and county.
I am of the opinion. that a submission to the
people of such a police regulation and Us
adoption would not make It a valid provision
of the charter any mere than the submission
to the people and their adoption would mate
as a valid part of the charter an amendment
providing that a person found leaving his
horse unhitched upon the street should be ar
rested. That would be the subject of munic
ipal ordinance and not of charter amendment.
I Ujlnk the proposed charter amendment also
unconstitutional In that it attempts arbitrarily
to discriminate between persons engaged in
the same class of business. Under the pro
,vlslons of this proposed, amendment a person
having property on th*- north side of a street
would be debarred "Tron! using it while a per
son on the south side of the same street and
directly opposite would, under exactly the
same surrounding conditions, be privileged to
utilize It. ~ Â¦
While I do not set it forth as ah express
ground of veto, I wisb also to call attention
to the danger of submitting to the peqple an
amendment to a section of the charter which
is not at all relevant to the subject matter
of the amendment. "*

Â¦pill amounts to 5502,892,459 does not sig
nify that the taxes on that amount
v ill be collected. Included in the sum
. ere assessments on property belonging
t'Â» the city, church property and prop
erty held in the* name of the Univer
sity of California, all of which under
'â¢the law is non-taxable. This will re
duce the mil by at least $1,000,000. Then
the delinquency in the collection of
taxes is to be considered. It has been
the custom to figure on a delinquency
cf $5,000,000. Last year, however, it was
about $2,000,000.
This year, owing to the enormous in
Â¦ crease in the individual assessments on
i<\al estate and the assessment on newly
-discovered property, a conservative es
timate of the delinquency would be be
tween $2,000,000 and $3,000,000. It will
therefore be easily seen that the actual
assessment roll upon which taxes will
be. collected will aggregate an amount
Jn the neighborhood of $500,000,000. and
ma? even fall below that figure.
â¢ These facts are serving to make the
Board of Supervisors, which fixed a
rate of $1 12 on an estimated roll of
JT.OO.OOO.OOO, decidedly uneasy. If the roll
falls below the last named figure it
vill mean that the income will be in
cufficient to conduct the affairs of the
niunicirality. How much the deficit is
l:kely to be can only be determined
v."hcn the full amount of tax collections
*iave been made. The deficit may be
*Mght, or Tt may amount to a figure
that will work some inconvenience to
the officials who direct the manage
ment cf the citv's finances, as the in
come may be insufficient to meet the
budget expenditures.
The committee attending the con
ference consisted of William Clack.
Frank Shannon, John Herget, Charles
MitcheH, William Rice, Thomas Lind
say and Ike Spiro.
Should the bill setting forth the
amendment be passed by the Board of
Supervisors it will go to the Mayor
for his signature or veto. Should his
Honor veto it and the veto be sus
tained then the liquor dealers purpose
to have the amendment submitted to
the voter?.
A committee from the California
Retail Liquor Dealers' Association
held a consultation yesterday at the
City Hall with Supervisors Hocks nnd
Lunstedt and after a long discussion
it was agreed that Hocks will submit
at next Monday's meeting of the
Board- of Supervisors an ordinance
setting forth a proposal to the voters
to amend the charter giving to an ap
plicant for a liquor permit which has
been denied by the Police Commission
the right of appeal to the Board of
Supervisors.
Some time ago Hocks introduced an
ordinance providing for the right of
appeal, which he desired passed by
the Supervisors. It was referred to
the City Attorney, who rendered an
opinion that the ordinance would be
in direct violation of th<e charter if it
were passed. Hocks thereupon de
cided to present the measure in the
form of an amendment to the charter.
The proposed amendment Is sub
sidiary to subdivision 3, section 1,
chapter 3, article 8 of the charter,
which allows all applicants for liquor
permits to have a hearing before the
Police Commission. The section to be
added follows:
After the hearing, should the Police Board
st III refute to grant such permit or should re
voke any permit that has been granted, the
person affected thereby may appeal from thfe
action of said board to the Board of Super
visors, and If in the Judgment of the Super
visors the said license .should be granted or
the revocation set aside, an order shall be made
to that effect and the Tax Collector shall issue
such license.

NEW YORK, Aug. 5.â Bradstreet's

Business and industrial conditions
are still irregular and render general

and absolutely brilliant conditions in
cotton tend to offset undeniably dis

cereal, wheat. Dispatches to Brad

ment in the distribution of merchan
dise at Western points, collections show
a slight gain and Southern advices,
buoyed up by fcood crop prospects, are
optimistic.
The iron trade, too. is showing im
provement, and even bituminous coal
is looking up. Other basic industries,
however, are not so favorably situated.
A few large strikes are responsible for
much Idleness in different industries.
Altogether the outlook, while cheerful

WASHINGTON, Aug. 5.â A thorough
investigation by the Interior Depart
ment of the charge recently made to
the President by a* delegation of the
Presbyterian Board of Home Missions
that the Ind'ans of California are on
the verge of starvation reveals the fact
that the Indians, on the contrary, are
amply crovided for. It was found that
J27.C00 already had been authorized for
the relief of the Pimas during this fiscal
year. Acting Secretary of the Interior
Ryan ndvised Commissioner of Indian
Affairs J< nes, who. was at San Fran
cisco, to nioet a representative of the
Presbyterian board at the Pima reser
vation. The Commissioner has tele
graphed the department that he has
returned from a visit to the Pimas, and
he adds:
"There is no more suffering there
than exists on nearly every reservation
In the Southwest owing to the severe
drought during the last three years.
The agent has ample funds on hand to
ielieve any suffering."
The agent for the Pimas has wired as
follows:
"No Indians are starving on the Pima
reservation. Flour, beef and wheat are
issued to the 300 unable to work. One
dollar a day is paid to the Indians who
will work. Sufficient Cunds have been
authorized for immediate relief. Noth
ing is required at present. Twenty
thousand dollars additional will be re
quired for the Pimas after January 1
if the drought continues." .-
The Interior Department recently
instructed its superintendent of Irriga
tion to construct a system of wells to
supply water for irrigation purposes for
the Indians, as the water from the
river already has been diverted by the
white settlers above the reservation.

the excitement in the community is in

Among the> witnesses was Lloyd
Sommerville, a nine-year-old boy, who
said that Mrs. Rae Krauss, the girl's
stepmother, who has been arrested,
gave him a note and money with which
to buy, strychnine at Logan's phar
macy. The boy is intelligent beyond
his years and fully realizes the im
portance of a truthful statement.
Mrs. Peter Hurley, v".o lives next
door to the Krauss family, testified
that she saw Mrs. Krauss give Lloyd
Sommerville the note. Che is positive
of that fact, for she says she intended
quizzing him on account of collecting
money.- The boy said that when he
returned with the strychnine Mrs.
Krauss thanked him and said she
would give it to a woman, meaning
Mrs. Shewalter, a neighbor, who she
said was waiting. inside. .
Mrs. Krauss denies having sent the
boy, and says that she would not know

such as nevor before was extended to a
visiting body of Odd Fellows.
In view of the fact that the time be

Fellows is so short, it would be impos
sible to change the decorative feature
of the electrical display on Market

to substitute the Odd Fellow, emblems
for those of the Knights Templar. Ar
rangements have been made by which
the electric lights will be allowed to
remain in place until after the adjourn
ment of the Sovereign Grand Lodge.
But the committee will have special
decorations at the Odd Fellows' build
ing, corner of Market and Seventh
streets, the Native Sons' building,
where the srand body. will meet, and at
Golden Gate Hall. The electrical deco
rations will also remain at the Me

NEW YORK. Aug. 5.â R. G. Dun &
Co.'s weekly review of trade to-morrow
will say: Labor controversies are the
serious drawbacks in business, most
other important factors tending toward
improvement. Despite some reduction
in the yield of wheat crop prospects are
most encouraging, and the loss in quan
tity of wheat promises to be fully offset
by higher prices, so that the agricul
tural communities will be in a position
to purchase commodities freely. De
layed orders for Iron and steel products
are being placed, and at woolen mills
there is a notable increase in activity.
Railway earnings in\luly were only 24
per cent lower than a year previous,
and at many cities there is evidence of
returning confidence. But several
strikes are in progress, and this, to
gether with others under consideration,
militate against the resumption of nor
mal conditions in trade and manufac
ture.
Foreign commerce at this port for the
last week shows a decrease of $1,047,488
in exports and a loss of $3,230,115 in im
ports as compared with the same time
last year, the latter item being partially
responsible for the loss in federal reve
nue. l"?'-v^
Tanners are seeking hides in good
condition, in which the supply is short,
as those taken off by unskilled hands
since the strike began are badly cut
and are offered at concessions.
Failures this week in the United
States are 230, against 220 last week,
231 the preceding week and 178 the cor
responding week last year.

ALTON. 111.. Aug. 5.â While bathing
in the -Mississippi River to-night
MJchael Riley. his daughter and six of
the latter's girl friends were drowned.
One child who was in the party waa
rescued. The dead:
MICHAEL RILEY. age 32 years.
ELIZABETH RILEY. aged 11 years.
ALLIESNYDER, age 14 years.
LUCY PATES, age 14 years.
LIZZIE PATES, age 14 years.
BESSIE BRUM, age 14 years.
MYRIE BRUM. age 10 years.
RUTH MARSHALL, age 11 years.
Riley lived near the river. In the
southern part of the city, and was ac
customed to Â¦ bathe on the beach in
front of his home after his return from
work. To-night his little daughter
begged to go with him, and Riley took
her and seven of her friends to the
beach with him.
When they entered the water Riley
bade the children join hands, and they
all w&ded into the river and walked
along a sandbar which stretches out
into the stream at that point. They
had gone some distance f.ron{ the shore,
when suddenly the whole party disap
peared beneath the water, having in
the darkness stepped from the sandbar
Into the deep channel.
The children struggled and scream
ed, fighting desperately to reach the
sandbar, on which the water was only
a foot or so in depth. Riley, who is
said to have been a good swimmer, is
believed to have been made helpless by
the girls clinging to him and hamper
ing his efforts to save them.
The only one in the party to regain
the sandbar was Mary Timlny, eight
years old. The child Is unable to tell
how she saved herself beyond the
statement that "I snatched my hand
loose from the grasp of the little girl
next to me and soon found that I cc-uld
stand up and the water only came to
my knees."
The beach where the accident oc
curred is practically deserted after
nightfall and the screams of the little
Timiny girl failed to attract any one
to the scene. After Riley and the little
girl's â¢ playmates had disappeared be
neath the water the child ran from the
beach and reached her home, scream
ing at the top of her lungs. She was
so hysterical that it was some time
before her parents could gather an ac
count of what had happened. .-
According to the account given by
the Timlny girl after she had been in
a measure calmed by her parents, the
drowningr was caused by the excite
ment incident, to the passage.; of a large
river steamboat. Before entering .the
water Riley had instructed the little
ones to maintain a tight grasp on one
another's hands,, he taking a place In
the center. The wash from the steam
boat ' caused considerable confusion
among the girls and In the darkness
they ' lost their bearings." Before they
were aware of their danger two or
three of them had stepped off the sand
bar Into the channel, dragging . the
others, with them. ...

OAKLAND. Aug. 5. â Politics is at
the bottom of a neighborhood row
that has made Matt McGinnoss and
John Denahy, one-time friends, the
bittereFt of enemies. The trouble
cropped out in the Board of Public
Works to-day. McGinness declares
Denahy has prevented him from get
ting a permit to move a cottage to
the McGinness lot on Adeline street,
near Fifth, which is opposite the
Denahy domicile.
McGinness avers that he bought a
â¢four-roomed cottage at Third and
Clay streets, purposing to move it and
renovate the house as a place of res
idence for himself. To gain the re
quired permission it was necessary to
get the written consent of a number
of property owners on each side of
â¢ the loU â There Denahy blocked Mc-
Ginness. according to the latter's
plaint.
"It was all because Denahy couldn't
carry the precinct for Pardee at the
last election," said McGinness. "Den
ahy was for Pardee strong. I was
also for Pardee, but first I was for
Joe Kelley for Supervisor, who car
ried the precinct by eight vote3. And
that's what is the matter. Now, if
Denahy don't give way J'H build a
' barn on the lot and I'll put up a Chi

I hold a lease to that lot."

ITS INTEREST IN CANAL
State to Dispose of Stock Which Has
Been the Cause of Much
Worrtanent.
BALTIMORE, Aug. 5. â The Board
of Public Works has decided to sell
the interests of the State of Maryland,
amounting to $30,000,000 in the Ches
apeake and Ohio canal to the highest
bidder/ The stock It was supposed
the State had been holding: for many
years cannot be found and no evidence
has come to light that It ever existed.
dovernor Warfleld has been quoted
as saying that neither the Treasurer,
Controller nor himself has been able
to trace any receipts showing that the
State ever had an Interest in the canal,
but that there was no doubt as to tha
legal rights of the commonwealth, la
the property.
KEG OF POWDER IN
A BURNING RESIDENCE
SAN^DIEGO, Aug. 5.â During a fire
which destroyed a large . two-story
house at the corner of Twelfth and K
streets to-day one of the firemen dis
covered a 25-pound keg of powder un
der a pile of debris. The flames were
then very near the explosive, which
the firemen carried to a place of
safety. Many persons on .the second
floor had narrow escapes. An Invalid
woman was rescued with much diffi
culty. One man, a Mexican, fell 'and
broke his arm while escaping.
The American Magnesite Company
has bonded itself for $500,000. These
bonds will go to the payment of the
promoters of the mining scheme for
the purchase of the property, and most
of them have Already been, delivered.
The money for the development of the
property'' will come from Chicago. Â¦
The mines are loca* ted on the side of
RecT Mountain, oft the dividing line be
tween Santa Clara and â¢ Stanislaus
counties. Â¦ The mines are nearly all in
Santa Clara County, with a few claims
in Stanislaus, though ; only a few mfles
south of the Alameda County, line; The
new company will build a' road- from
the rnines on_Ked/ Mountain . to the
Alameda County line, there to connect
with the. road now being built up the
Arroyo" Mocho from LivenViore by the
Aldmeda County Supervisors. The. of
ficials of" the company say! that they
will make Livermore 7 the point on the
railroad through, which they will, do
all of their : work, and that the various
'factories will be located on the : OaR
land water front If the deal v goes
through as the officials outline it it
BONDED FOR $500,000.
The principal use to which magnesite
is put is the manufacture of fire brick
for locomotives', smelters, furnaces and
boilers of all kinds. J. V. Rose, who is
interested in the manufacture of this
brick in Sharon, Pa., is one of the
principal men in the deal. Rose will
organize the Rose Brick Company
and is now in the East. This
company will include his plants
in the East and one -to be erect
ed in Oakland. This__ latter plant
will utilize apportion of the output of
the Red Mountain mine. It is the In
tention to erect a plant that will have
an output of 100,000 bricks a day. This
factory will also turn out a building
brick.
In the reduction of the magnesite ore
a large quantity of carbonic acid gas
is given off. This will be utilized by
the American Carbonic Acid Gas Com
pany, of which John Deere of the Deere
Implement Company will be president
and George A. Wyman, his son-in-law,
will be manager. This company will
also be operated in Oakland.
The third corporation will be the
Plastic Construction Company, of
which Edwin D. Weary of Chicago will
be president and manager and Peter
Burg Jagger of London, England, will
be vice president. These men control
the American rights for the manufac
ture of a patent brick and construction
material, the basis of which is mag
nesite. This material is said to be ab
solutely fireproof and can be made into
flooring and put to many other uses.
This factory will also be located in
Oakland. J .
All of those interested- in the general
deal will have some share in each ona
of the companies. Peter L. Kimberly
of Chicago is said to be. the principal
backer and will be on the board of di
rectors of all the companies. The oth
ers whose names have been mentioned
have Interests financial In each com
pany, but will divide" their managerial
services. â¢
This company will begin its work
first, opening the deposits of magnesite
on Red Mountain, building roads and
preparing to ship ore to Oakland and
New York..
OAKLAND, Aug. 5. â The American
Magnesite Mining Company will /begin
work on its mine in the Livermore
Mountains September. 1 and with the
announcement of this fact concludes
one of the largest mining and manufac
turing deals that has been made in the
State for many a day. Back of this
deal Is plenty of capital, $500,000 of
which has already been put up in bonds
for the purchase of the property, the
opening of vast mining properties south
of Livermore, and the establishment of
at least three manufacturing plants
upon the shores of San Francisco Bay
in the city of Oakland.
The deeds for the transfer of the
'property and the notification of the
bond issue we're made a few weeks ago,
but the magnitude of the work, the
amounts involved and the plans of the
backers of the enterprises and . their
names have been kept very quiet until
to-day, when, the bonds .for the pur
chase of the * property were delivered.
Now everything is ready to go ahead
and by September 1 men will be at
work on the 'side of Red Mountain
opening up the vast deposits of mag
nesite. ; â¢
There will be one parent and three
subsidiary corporations. All are backed
by Chicago capital and the Pacific
Coast representatives announce that
the corporations will all be close ones
and that no stock is for sale. It is as
serted that the stopk has all been ap
portioned among those who financed
and those who promoted the deal.
The parent company Is the American
Magnesite Company, organized under
the laws of the State of Maine. This
company has for its president Colonel
G. Watson French of Chicago, who is
interested in the management of sev
eral large steel plants in that section.
H. C. Stilwell of Fruitvale, one of the
California promoters, will remain in
the company as vice president and gen
eral Pacific Coast agent of the products
of the mine and manufacturing com
panies. Frank A. Daily of Chicago will
be secretary, as one of the represent
atives of the Chicago capital, invested.
Gustave F. Fischer of Rubins, Dupey
& Fisher, representing the United
States Steel Corporation, will be treas
urer. Charles H. Spinks of Berkeley
will be manager of the mining propo
sition with E. L. Richmond superin
tendent at the mine at Red Mountain.
EXPECT TO SHIP ORE.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 5.â Permission
has been given this city by the War
Department to make a water park and
boulevard of the strip of land on the
south side of the tidal canal between
Park street and Fruitvale avenue that
is owned by the United States Gov
ernment.
During the carnivals held on the
south bank cf the canal it occurred to
many that that strip of realty con
trolled by the Federal Government
could be so Improved with trees,
lawns, flowers and walks that it would
be one of the beauty spots of the city.
Negotiations were opened between the
City Trustees and the War Depart
ment with the result that the desired
permit has just been received by City
Clerk James V.V Gillogly from Robert
Shaw Oliver, acting Secretary of War.
In his communication Oliver. embodies
the following stipulations:
"That the trees, shrubs and lawns
be planted and cared for without ex
pense to the Government."
"That the Government relinquishes
none of its rights by authorizing the
occupancy of its land for the purposes
set forth." ,
"That this permit is revocable at will
by the Secretary of War."
"That the work herein permitted to
be done shall be subject to the super
vision and approval of the engineer
officer of the United States army in
charge of the locality."
It is intended by the City Trustees
to lay out and improve the strip as
soon as the municipal funds will per
mit of such work.
It is now stated that everything that
has been done for him seemingly has
failed to stay his malady. His wife
and children are afraid of him. While
his condition is believed to be due to
heredity, he having a sister in the
asylum, the direct cause Is attributed
to a terrific beating he got in the prize
ring .here. He had virtually retired
from the fighting game, but when the
butchers* strike was declared he lost
his job and took on a match and got
terribly punished.
The family of Charlie Tye, the light
weight prizefighter, has concluded that
his mental condition is such that he is
dangerous to be at large. A warrant
was sworn to before Deputy District
Attorney Ilynes by A. M. Freeman,
his brother-in-law, this afternoon,
charging him with insanity.
It was only about three months ago
that he was before the Insanity com
mission, but so much was promised
for him by his" friends in the way of
care and attention that he was al
lowed his liberty in the hope that quiet
would restore him to his normal condi
tion.

With the close of the summer school
to-day at the University of California
after a period of six weeks, there came
the usual bustle among faculty and
students and the hurry to get trunks
and baggage out of town on the first
train. Few of the European and East
ern members of the faculty lingered a
moment after their final lectures, the
one idea being to get started on the
way across the continents. All that
are left now consist of California fac
ulty and students waiting for the reg
ular college year to open.;
.Of the Easterners, the only laggards
are eight, who will stop over on their
way out of the State at Regent Charles
Wheeler's home on the McCloud River
in Shasta : County; where President
Wheeler will also be a guest. --/h
All through the session the visiting
members of the faculty have been
wined and dined and feted, so that
most of them are surfeited with din
ners and receptions. They have been
entertained by President Wheeler and
President David Starr Jordan, Dean
Leon J. Richardson and by most of the
prominent professors of the California
faculty. Professor Hugo de Vries of
the University of Amsterdam and Pro
fessor Svante August Arrheniua of
Stockholm have been the guests of
Luther Burbank of Santa Rosa, Be
sides these individual entertainers,
there have been functions in honor of
individual members of the Harvara
Club, the Unitarian Club, the Wiscon
sin Club, the Stanford Faculty Club
and the California Faculty Club.
In point of numbers, aside from the
important character of the personnel
of the faculty, this session has been the
largest in the history of the university
summer schools. The revised figures
show that the total number of registra
tions this year was 913 students,
against 859 last year, which was then
the largest of any previous school.
There were 1400 applications, with 933
qualifications and 20 withdrawals, leav
ing 913 as the net result.
These results are so flattering that
It will take a special effort to keep up
the high standard In numbers and fac
ulty next year. Professor Wheeler feels
that he is justified now in inviting to
the coast the most noted savants. Al
ready Hne3 have been laid to secure for
the next session mdn from the East and
Europe who have added so much to
the store of the world's knowledge by
their scientific work.
The summer session of the Pacific
Theological Seminary, the first of the
kind ever undertaken by that school,
closed its doors to-day after being
open two weeks. Seventy students were
enrolled and a course of lectures was
given by divines invited from the East
and from among the clergy of Califor
nia. So successful was the school that
it will be repeated next year, except
that its scope will be much more com
prehensive.

into drunkards' graves. The present situation
across the water of fifty-five Bishops in the
Church of England as stockholders In brewer

of a Bishop In the great Episcopal church in
our own land taking a leading part in tho
opening exercises of a saloon, closing same by
singing the Doxolosy, should make every pro

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 5. â The

BRITISH i=HIP WANDERER, WHICH ARRIVED HERE TESTERDAT FROM
ANTWERP. AFTER VOYAGE WHICH VESSEL'S SKIPPER DESCRIBES AS
ROUGHEST AND LONGEST PASSAGE HE HAS MADE IN MANY YEARS.
Sails were blown away and as the
vessel wallowed among the hills and
valleys of angry water the cargo
on the 'tween decks broke adrift.
Bales, barrels and boxes chased each
other across the deck, smashing each
other and distributing samples of gen
eral merchandise from one end of the
'tween decks to the other.
The Wanderer was- sailed into Fal
mouth, where sails were renewed and
the cargo restowed. She resumed the
voyage February 19 and two days
later ran into another heavy gale.
Unable to negotiate the Horn the
Wanderer came by way of the Cape of
Good Hope, where more storms were
encountered. Captain Dunning has
been going to sea for 35 years. The
voyage just ended was the roughest
and longest, he says, that he ever
made.
The Wanderer left Antwerp on Jan
uary 23 in a dense tog, which only
cleared when blown away by a howl
ing southwester. So bad did the weath
er become that Captain Dunning ran
his ship into St. Helens Bay for shel
ter. After a week's detention the voy
age was resumed, but the English
channel was still in surly mood and
another and greater gale took charge
of the Wanderer.
The officers and crew of the British
ship "Wanderer, which arrived yester
day, 1?5 days from Antwerp, have
learned more about storms during the
last six months than many sailormen
discover in a lifetime.
The committee referred to in the
above dispatch was composed of
Bishop Brent of the Episcopal church
(chairman). Dr. Albert, a Finipino, and
Major Carter, president of the Board
of Health of the Philippine Islands. It
visited China, Japan, Burmah, Java
and some of the^Ialay States and was
absent on its labors for five or six
months.
This committee was appointed after
vigorous discussion in Manila of the
proposed opium bill introduced before
the Civil Commission by Commissioner
Smith of California, who went out to
the islands originally as colonel of the
California Volunteers. This bill pro
vided for the creation of an opium
monopoly to control the opium traffic
throughout the entire archipelago, to
be sold by the Government to the high
est bidder. It was strongly opposed
by the missionary element and church
interests in the islands. The matter
was referred from Manila to Wash
ington and the ultimate result of this
step was the appointment of the inves
tigating committee which has Just
turned in Its report.

Tidings come from Tulare that the
Republican convention of that county
The fight in the Republican ranks of
the Thirteenth Senatorial District, em
bracing the Thirty-second and Thirty
fifth Assembly districts, Is warming up.
It appears that Ruef, Lynch and
others of the regular organization gave
the districts a â¢ programme without
taking Dick Welch, the chief wharf
inger, into their inner confidence. The
programme did not embrace the name
of Welch for State Senator to succeed
himself, hence the revolt. Members of
the organization assert that Welch has
no one to blame but himself. He backed
and filled and finally gave out the in
timation that he did not want to run
for the Senate,again.- Consequently the
organization concluded that he was
out of the fight. Richard J. Welch
heads the opposition ticket in the
Thirty-second Assembly District for
delegates to the State convention, and
Robert Gordon heads the list of oppo
sition delegates to the legislative and
judicial convention. The organization
tickets in the Thirty-second District
are headed by John E. Heileman for
StatÂ» and B. j P. Lagrave for local
convention. Well-posted politicians and
party workers in the district predict
the ruccess of the opposition. Senator
Welch possesses elements of personal
popularity, and in a certain sense
stand:- before the people as an exponent
of the doctrine of home rule. In the
prolonged Senatorial contest which cul
minated in the election of Thomas R.
Bard to the 'United States Senate,
Welch trained with the Burns-Herrin
machine.
BARD IS INDORSED.
There is much conjecture concerning
the attitude of Mayor Schmltz and A.
Ruef in relation to the fight in the
Democratic party. It is intimated that
a sense of gratitude for past favors will
impel the Mayor to help Hearst. If
Schmitz and Ruef should pull down the
labor ticket and order the voters behind
that organization to reinforce the Horse
and Cart column McNab would prob
ably, be repulsed next Tuesday. There
are rumors at the City Hall that the
support McNab is securing from As
sessor Dodge, Coroner Leland, Sheriff
Curtis and Recorder' Godchaux is only
halfhearted. The deputies and clerks
hear that Delmas, Creswell and Me-
Enerrfey are boosting O'Brien and the
subordinates do not want to take a
step that might excite the displeasure
of the transcendent Democrats.
REPUBLICAN RANKS.
SCHMITZ AXD RUEP.
It is gossip all along the line that
E. J. Livernash will be renomlnated for
Congress, even if the battle on Tues
day goes against Hearst and O'Brien.
There is no certainty, however, that
Wynn of the Fifth District will fare
as well at the hands of the Democratic
party as' his colleague of the Fourth.
McNab and the regulars are under no
sort of obligation to nominate Wynn.
The Incident is recalled that Wynn
went to Santa Cruz wearing a Hearst
button. so large thagb it made the Con
gressman look smaller than he really
is. It is the presumption in the corral
of the Horses and Carts that Wwnn is
for O'Brien and Hearst in the present
controversy.
Leaders of the Horse and Cart ring
of the party also expect some help from
the Republican machine on the water
front.' Expectations of assistance from
the Postmaster will not be realized.
Arthur G. Fisk positively asserts that
there will be no interference on his'
part in the affairs of the Democratic
party. Revenue Collector Lynch, If so
minded, might lend a few workers to
Jim O'Brien v in districts where no op
position confronts the regular Republi
can organization, but Gavin McNab,
who has some influence with high of
ficials in Washington, is watching
every move in the Republican camp.
There is even betting In the court of
the Palace Hotel on the outcome of the
fight between Gavin McNab and James
H. O'Brien for the privilege of control
ling the Democratic local convention.
McNab has the advantage which comes
from the control of the regular party
machinery and many of the politicians
who are disinterested observers of the
present war in the Democratic tfamp
predict that the regulars will elect a
majority of the delegates to the conven
tion. The Horses and Carts will need
something better than an even break
in the result at the polls to accomplish
anything in the convention. McNab is
decidedly clever in generalship and
could enter the convention as a leader
of the minority and emerge therefrom
as a director of the majority.
All the observing politicians agree
that O'Brien is putting up a rattling
good fight. If Hearst can be induced
to put some more money into the cam
paign of 1904 the insurgents may cap
ture the convention and dictate the
nominations of the party for the Su
perior Court and Legislature.
LIVERXASIl IS SLATED.
The following officers will accompany
General MacArthur to the camp on
Monday morning at 8 o'clock: Colonel
S. P. Jocelyn, general staff; Colonel
George Andrews. Major Leo Febiger.
Major T. R. Adams, Colonel TV. S. Pat
ten. Captain G. W. Ruthers, Colonel A.
r\ Girard. Major W. B. Rochester and
Captain W. F. Creary. The families of
Colonel Jocelyn and Colonel Patten will
ftay at the Paso Robles Hotel during
the maneuvers.
Everything is now ready at Atasca
dero for the reception of the troops.
Th<- Â«?xnress office at Asuncion is in
full working order, and the Southern
I*acifie Company has established a res
taurant at that point for the conve
nience of those wishing to visit the
camp.
In order that the men of the regular
army and the militia may get their
mail promptly the authorities have de
cided to establish a tent postofflce at
Camp Atascadero. All letters should
i>e pent direct to this address. There
the first sergeants of each company
vili gather the letters twice a day and
distribute them to the men. This is the
iyitem in use at every large military
ca'rnp. Whether engaged in mimic or
real warfare, the boys in blue want
th^Fe precious letters from home as
oukfcly as possible, and this arrange
rr.f nt insures prompt delivery.
â¢ Al! detraining and entraining of
troop? "'ill take place at Atascadero
The signal car is a stanch affair. It
suffered somewhat during Its transit
across the ccntinent. and its top was
rather demoralized. On its arrival here
It was at once taken to a garage, where
it was put in order. The new machine
w^nt to the front in perfect shape. It
carried a complete outfit for wire re
;â¢ siring, consisting of twelve lances six
teen feel long, two crowbars, a post
bole digger, 100 insulators and brack
ets, coils of wire, thirty-five pounds of
. rails, six axes and six hatchets. At
daybreak this morning the signal car
and convoy will leave San Jose and run
to Monterey, where the party will re
. niain over night. Early to-morrow
morning they will leave Monterey and
" make the run to Paso Robky. where
they will remain Sunday night, and
â¢ early Monday morning they will run
c.ut to the cam?. Major West has ar
ranged to have the details of the trip
carefully kept and every incident of the
run of the car will be officially noted.
Immediately upon arrival at the
camp the car win be rut into use and
- test* will be made daily. During the
. maneuvers, beginning August 13, the
car will follow the troops wherever pos
. Fible.
Major West. Majof* Dunning. Captain
Lyman and T. J. Barbour left at 3
o'clock in a regular everyday auto for
San Jose, where they will wait for the
rÂ»ew car and act as a convoy from that
point for the balance of the trip to the
camp.
The new automobile constructed for
the signal corps of the United States
Government left town yesterday after
noon at 5 o'clock for Camp Atascadero.
It was in charge of Chauffeur S. D.
Hewson and Max Pollner, master sis
ral electrician.
MANILA, Aug. 5.â The opium com
mittee appointed last August by for
mer Governor Taft to investigate the
laws and conditions with regard to
opium in all Oriental countries has ren
dered its report. The committee rec
ommends that the opium traffic should
be strictly a Government monopoly at
once; that at the end of three years
the importation of opium should be
absolutely prohibited, with the excep
tion of that needed for medicinal pur
poses; only confirmed habitues of the
drug who are over 21 years of age to
be. granted a smoker's license; that an
educational campaign against the use
of opium be started in the schools;
that the habitues of the drug be treat
ed free of charge in Government hos

The battleship Ohio is now enrolled among the for

PROFESSOR. E. J. WICKSON, connected with the
agricultural department of the University of Cali
fornia, . has . entertainingly described the aids that*
California has contributed to\ fruit ( growing. These orig
inated in home needs, but the means have been adopted
elsewhere, so that this State has added not only, its
products but a knowledge of how to cultivate varieties
to the world at large.
Clean cultivation during the growing season, Professor
Wickson asserts in the Pacific Rural Press, may a not
have been invented in 'California, but the world paid no
attention to it until California exhibited its benefits on
hundreds of thousands of acres. The truth of Jethro
Tull's theory of. tillage was demonstrated. Clean surface
cultivation, . coupled with as exemplified in
this State, is acknowledged by fruit growers generally
to be essential. 'That lesson is^lasting and the profit to
The startling discovery has been made in New York
that the owners of the General Slocum have in opera

gested itself to a horrified public surely this condition
docs. Prosecution immediate and punishment severe
should follow the disclosure. One such lesson as the
burning of the General Slocum is enough for the A'mer
can people. '
BENEFITS OF FRUIT GROWING.
The Grand Jury of Bell County, Texas, has indicted
fifteen hundred physicians and druggists for violating a
local option law and selling whisky to the thirsty who
otherwise would have to exist without the cup that as
pires to things new and strange even in the Lone Star
State. The defendants should be prosecuted fqr cruelty
to humanity. Anybody who will encourage the sale of
drug-store whisky is guilty of a heinous offense against
the human species.
The Japanese have insisted upon the deportation of
a dare-devil American correspondent, whose only fault
was the remarkable exploit of getting into Port Arthur
and getting out again with a whole skin and a thrilling
experience. The little brown men would have been wiser
in their generation had they suffered the Yankee scribe
to remain and then kept close to his trail. While he un
questionably would have led them into trouble he would
have given them something substantial for their pains.
MINNESOTA MASSACRE â Fair
banks, Cal. In the early part of 1S82
there was trouble among the Indian
tribes of Minnesota and Dakota. . The
first trouble was bv the Sioux under
Little Crow, upon Yellow Medicine
Agency, August IS of that year, when
all the whites, old and young,-- were
murdered. August 23 New Ulm' was
attacked and manv whites murdered,
but the citizens hastily banded (or de
fense, forced the Indians off, and on
the following day soldiers came to their
relief. Fort Ridglev was besieged for
nine davs and its small garrison re
pelled three desperate attacks before it
was relieved on the 26th. The Indians
then went northward toward Fort
Abercrombie, murdering and plunder-
Ing as they went. Upon an appeal from
Governor Ramsey and the Legislature.
General Pope and United State3 sol
diers were sent to the rescue. Two as
saults were made on the Indians at the
fort named in September; vhey retreat
ed westward, but-jyere followed and
were fovced to make a stand at Wood
lake, where they were^utterly defeated
About 500 Indians were taken prison
ers, 300 tried by court-martial and sen
tenced to be hanged. The President In
terfered and only thlrtv-two were
hanged, the remainder being put in
confinement for a time and visited
with lighter punishment. The loss nf
white lives was estimated at not less
than aOO. either killed by the savaeea
or perishing from sickness and expos
ure, the v result of their hasty flight
from their homes.
Russia's Scourg^e.
The London Mail gives this spirited
description of the nihilist:
At the edge of the pavement he
stands, in the uniform of a Russian
university student, smoking a yellow
cigarette, and the carriages ply past
him throughout the hour of prome
nade.
Princesses, men In the uniform of
ducal regiments, the splendor and
wealth of the capital of Russia file
along as though for his inspection and
his is the eye that weighs and ap
praise* them all by the standard of
the pocr.
To look at him one would say the
fire of nihilism ran in a foul channel.
He Is meager, mean-chested, little of
stature, with low brows and a wide,
loose mouth, a representative of the
poor type, lacking In brawn and
beauty, springing weedily from a
profitless stock. There is something
vapid in the bloodless pouch of the
cheek and the bonelessness of the jaw;
nothing finishes with a click; the con
tours are not definite.
Ah! but you have not seen the eye â
the eye that- burns far back In Its
socket, the poet's eye that see Death
rido by on a white horse among the
care-less guardsmen and ladies, the eye
that is dull to the material and kindles
only for visions.
; In the lurking frenzy that inhabits
there, like a genius or an obsession,
there is, that which rede"ems the whole
unloveliness of the gross face and
body, as though the soul ran riot
while the flesh obeyed laws.
Madmen have such eyes, and great
artiste, , and the nihilist must needs be
of the essence â¢ f both. HfÂ» is the
product of a need and an mspiration,
the great need of the stricken Russian
poor, the inspiration of new knowl
edge and freedom seen from afar. -
The First Submarines.
So many warships have been de
stroyed by submarine explosions in
the Russo-Japanese war that each side
has repeatedly accused the other of
using a submarine torpedo boat. If
that should prove to be the case it
would be the first time such a vessel
has ever been successfully used in war
by any nation but the United States.
The first submarine vessel ever used
to attack a hostile ship in war time
descended Into the Hudson River at
Whitehall, under the eyes cf Washing
ton and his staff, in September, 1776.
The British had attacked New York:
Long Island had been lost to them and
Lord Howe's fleet was anchored in
North River. David Bushnell, a young
engineer just graduated from Yale Col
lege, had invented a spherical copper
vessel called the American Turtle, in
tended for submarine use. It was pro
pelled by oars set in water-tight sock
ets, had a tiny conning tower and was
just big enough for one man. It had
an auger protruding through the top
and the plan of attack was for the
submarine worker to drill this into the
bottom of an enemy's ship. A mine
was then to be detached from the out
side, of the submarine and fastened to
the enemy by the drill, a clockwork
set going and when the diver had es
caped the explosion would follow.
Bushnell showed this machine to
General Parsens and to General Wash
ington, who apprbved. Ezra Lee, a
brave young sergeant, was detailed to
make the attempt and Bushnell taught
him to work the Turtle. At midnight.
September 6, he entered the little ves
sel and was towed out into the river
by rowboats. Washington and his
staff watched anxiously for the re
sult.
The prime object of Lee's attack was
the sixty-four-gun frigate Eagle, on
board which was Lord Howe himself.
Hours passed without an explosion and
at last when dawn came Washington
was convinced Lee was lost. Just then,
however, barges were seen putting out
from the shore - of Governor's Island.
They went almost to midstream then
scattered and made hastily for shore.

THERE is not a magazine in America that can
show within its covers such a group of famous
names as will be found in The Sunday Call Maga
zine to-morrow. In affording such an expensive array of
the leading literary talent of the day, The Sunday Cail
has taken a tremendous and original departure from
time-honored Sunday supplement methods. There will
be an installment of a novel and seven short stories,
all by leading authors, in addition to eight pages of
special articles. In the matter of space alone no monthly
magazine can publish the quantity of material that
appears in The Sunday Call.
Finley Peter Dunne ("Mr. Dooley"), who needs no
introduction; Marie Gorelli, the greatest woman writer
of the day; Jerome K.' Jerome, author of "Three J^ien
in a Boat"; Max Pemberton, author of "Kronstadt" and
"The Phantom Army"; Stewart Edward White, author
of "The Blazed Trail" and other famous stories of the
hardy lumbermen of the northern lumber camps; Ray
Stannard tiaker, whose series of articles recently pub
lished in McClure's on the labor question has^made his'
name a household word, and Keith Gordon, comprise the
leading names in The Sunday Call Magazine for to-mor
rpw and constitute an array of the very strongest names
ill the literary world of the day.
The Dooley article for 'to-morrow will be a discourse
on the duties of the Vice President, an office which,
according to Mr. Dooley, "isn't a crime exactly. Ye
can't be sint to jail f'r it. But it's a kind of disgrace."
"Dr. Xavier," a novel of mystery and adventure by Max
Pemberton, which will run in four installments, makes
its initial appearance. The story deals with the for
tunes of Esther Venn, who is taken from a position of
poverty in London and transformed, through the art of
Dr. Xavier, into a reigning beauty of the Paris salons
and a bride of royalty. The aims of Dr. Xavier, in his
operations with respect to her, form elements of mys
tery in a story which is at all times engrossing. "Wait
ers I Have Known" is a quaint dissertation by Jerome
K. Jerome; Stewart Edward White tells a frontier story
with plenty of action and gun play in "Billy's Tender
foot"; Ray Stannard Baker's story "Uncle Luther Dow
ell's Wooden Leg" will appeal to all lovers of a homely,
old-fashioned tale; and on the storiette page "Rafo," by
Frank H. Sweet; "Her Last Call," by Keith Gordon,
and "A New Climax," by Hubert McBean Johnston, form
an entertaining trio.
Among the special articles will be "The Chorus Girl,"
by Colonel Kate; "The Secrets of Home Candy Making,"
and "Grandmother's Quaint Old Shawl," by Madge
Moore.

Geronimo, the Shadon:
Geronimo. the old Indian chief, re
cently visited Lawton. O. T. The Law
ton State Democrat says: "The health
of the old chief 13 still good, although
he is very aged. His home is ten miles
from Lawton, yet he usually walks to

He Is Quite often asked to give an ex
hibition of his skill as a marksman
with the bow. This he readily consents
to do provided a nickel is made* the tar
get and is to become his own in case
he hits it. Geronimo denies the state
ment of General Miles that the general
captured him. The old warrior says
that somewhere up on the mountains,
when he was on the warpath, two white
men came to him and told him that
General Miles wanted to see him. The
men accompanied him to the camp of
the general and he was made a pris
oner. Geronimo says he thinks It was

Anyway, he says, it was up in thft

no longer look upon Geronimo as their

Warned by the conflagration that devastated the busi
ness district of Baltimore and destroyed magnificent steel
and stone structures as if they had been paper, men who
lead our citizens in the march of municipal progress arc
discussing the serious problem of what constitutes an
absolutely fire-proof building. With San Francisco on
the very threshold of its entrance into the world as a
great modern city it is difficult to suggest a problem of
more intimate or pressing importance than that involved
in this' discussion.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL.
5 HENRI ETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. July 23. â Not
more suddenly did fame come to Ba
den Pov.eil through hi? heroic defense
of Mflfeking than in these piping days
of oeate it has descended on Jamie
Gill, the Irish steeplejack, because of
his long <jefianÂ«-e of the police from
the dizzy summit of a lofty chimney-
Ftatk. The exploit has made Jamie a
national character. It has been de
scribed at length in all the London
and provincial papers. And the nim
bte-wrltted Jamie has not been long in
turning: his fame to pecuniary account,
for he is now filling a profitable en
gagement in a Belfast music hall,
with the prospect of making still more
.money on the London variety stage.
But his sudden attainment of prosper
ity can hardly be cited as an example
that will serve the purpose of popular
tempernm** orators. Had he not one
day imbibed more of the 'crayther"
than was jjood for him he would still
be pursuing his dangerous calling: in
obscurity. It is a lamentable truth
that he owes his rise in fortune to the
fact that on this occasion he did get
unmistakably and outrageously drunk.
He was arrested and sentenced to pay
a fine, or in default thereof expiate his
offense by a month's imprisonment
Jamie elected to do neither. When
returning Fobriety had again given
him full command of his legs he suc
ceeded in giving the constables the
flip and nought refuge on the top of a
mammoth ehimneystack belonging to
an abandoned factory on Sugar Isl
and, a short distance from his own
home in the town of Newry. Its de-
Ftruction had been decreed and some
inside scaffolding, which had been
erected to facilitate the wm-k, made
the perilous ascent a comparatively
essy task for a man of Jamie's nerve
and skill. But it was too tough a
job for the police to undertake â es
pecially with Jamie on the summit
prepared to drop a brick on the head
of the firpt of them who appeared in
side. They concluded that it would
be safer to lay siege to him without
and starve him into surrender. But
Jamie's numerous friends contrived to
smuggle supplies to him despite all
their vigilance and for two weeks he
held possession of his novel fortress.
fome ally managed to send him up
a red flag, which he waved defiantly
at the police b*Â»low and dared them to
come up and take him. During the
daytime crowds assembled about the
chimneystack and vociferously cheer
ed him. Newspaper correspondents
were dispatched to the scene, who
held long distance interviews with
Jamie and telegraphed to their va
rious papers graphic accounts of the
progress of the siege. All this spelled
fame for the plucky Irishman. Just
how he contrived to sleep on his giddy
perch is his own secret. But every
morning found him there as fresh as
a daisy, dancing jigs and singing songs

low and heaping scorn upon the po
lice. Jamie. became the popular hero
of Newry. Had there been a Parlia
mentary vacancy in the district he

majority.
- But pride goes before a fall. One
night Jamie essayed to descend from
the chimney to communicate with
some of his friends who had signaled
him that the "bobbie" who was sup
posed to be on watch was 'asleep.
Som? distance from the ground he
mi6sed his footing and came down with
a "crash. The policeman, awakened
from his slumber, pounced upon him.
Jamie was a prisoner and it was ap
parently all up with him. But his
wits did not desert him. He was hurt,
but his Injuries were not nearly so
bad as ho made out. Between simu

internally and insisted on being car

in his crippled condition Jamie could

For a coup!, of days he lay in bed

no watch 'over him there; it seemed
obviously needless. They proposed
that he should be removed to the pris

could receive proper medical attend

tyggestion. But bright and early r.ext

As the car approached the corner
the stylish young woman in the sky
scraper hat arose and advanced toward
the rear platform. When opposite the
conductor extended her daintily
gloved hand.
"I beg your pardon," she said in a
musical voice, "but you overlooked my
fare. Here it is."
The conductor looked confused.
"Thank you, miss," he mumbled,
glancing around at the other passen
gers to see if he could ferret out any
of the company's "spotters." She
seemed to read his thoughts.
"Oh, don't 'think that I am going to
report you . for carelessness," she
hastened. "No, Indeed. You are
probably one of the most conscientious
employes on the road."
The conductor actually blushed.
"Thanks, miss," "he stammered.
"You are so busy looking out for the
safety of your passengers that it is
Impossible for you to be collecting
fares all the time. These big cars
should have two conductors. Better
lose a thousand fares than have one
accident. Am I right?"
"Yes, miss."
"Your face is honest, young man. I
never hesitate to tell a person this
when I am certain it is true. Always
remember that honesty Is the best
policy."
Gathering her slgrts firmly, she
alighted and was soon lost in the
crowd. The conductor took a long
breath.
"Talk about sensible women," he
ejaculated for the benefit of the plat
formites. "Well, I've been on this line
ten years and that is the finest speci
men of the true lady I've ever met."
Then he looked at the "nickel" she
had pressed into his hand. It was

away and gave him no purchase. He
worked two hours at the Eagle and
then visited other vessels with no bet

and started home. He came to the

THE first session of the Merchant Marine Com
mission developed the three lines of opinion on
the subject which divide the friends of American
shipping on both seaboards. First of these is in favor
; of a direct subsidy, which is better called a bounty.
The second stands for free ships â that is to say per
mission to put the American flag over foreign built ships
and grant differential duties on all imports carried by
The third wants zn- export bounty per ton ad
valorem on all domestic goods carried by American
ships. v
These three opinions are represented on the com
mission itself. As they all aim at the same object it
is proper to inquire into the difference between the
means they propose for reaching it. The object to be
attained is the encouragement to be given by the
money of the Federal Government to the Revival of
American shipping. The proponents of the three plans
will not differ materially as to the annual amount of
such money required to effect the purpose.
The first plan is to take it directly from the treasury
and apply it -to the purpose under such rules of over
sight as will protect the expenditure. The second is
to'pay the same amount of money by taking it out of
the revenues before they reach the treasury. The third
is to put it in the treasury on imports and pay it out
as a bounty on exports. The first and- third plans have
the merit of requiring the building of ships by Ameri
can labor, so that part of the bounty, by whichever mean?
secured, will go to pay the wages of American mechanics.
With this exception the plans all merge into the one
issue of a bounty. This being true, that one should
be adopted which will the easiest and most economically
apply that bounty to the object sought. It is an
augury of success that the friends of the proposition
'have so nearly reached an agreement that either plan
may be adopted with the substantial hope that it will
attain the object sought.
It is the belief of many practical men and thinkers
that the best of the three plans is the direct bounty,
because of its superior economy and its more imme
diate effect. A differential import duty will require a
coftly special system of custom-house accounting for
ascertainment of the rebate and it Will impart great un
certainty to the volume of revenue, which will prevent
accuracy of estimates as to the prospective resources of
the treasury. The export bounty is open to the same
objection, as it will require the addition of special
facilities in the custom-houses to verify the exports and
apply to each its ad valorem share of the bounty. This
also leaves the resources of . the treasury in doubt,
since it is quite impossible to estimate the amount that
will be required to pay the bounty, the volume of which
will fluctuate with the foreign demand for our products.
After all, both these plans are to effect the same
thing as the first â the provision of a money bounty to
revive our merchant marine. We can understand that
there is a natural desire to get the money in such a
way as shall excite the least popular prejudice, and that
causes a resort to an indirect bounty system, which
may,, in the end, cost the people more than if the
bounty were direct. If this be so, it will be better for
the proposed policy to approach the solution squarely
in the beginning by direction and not indirection.
One other merit of a direct bounty is that there are
no mysteries about it. It is not half concealed and
half disclosed. Its features are all in full view from
the beginning. If it prove necessary to change after
it has been tried, it is easy to go from it to either of
the other plans, but a change from either to it would
be difficult, and so, if they prove defective and incom
petent to accomplish the purpose, there would be danger
of a collapse on the whole policy.
If free ships are adopted the permission to put them
tinder American register should have a time limit.
Free ships Would; in our judgment, put an end to Amer
ican ship building. It would disuse and dismantle every
yard in the country. It goes # without saying that a
revival of our. merchant marine means,, or, shoald mean,
not only the, owning of ships, but also the capacity to
build them. To this end the bounty should flow both
ways. It should put ships on the stocks in American
yards as well as on the sea ,under the American flag.
If we have to resort to foreign builders to buy ships
we will have taken but a short step out of our present
system, which compels us to resort to the foreign owners
of ships to transport our commerce.
Any system that is adopted should provide the pay
ment of part of the bounty to secure the apprenticeship
of American boys in seamanship. Our people have
lapsed in the seafaring habit. To such an extent has
this occurred that nearly all of our merchant crews are
foreigners, as ye a large percentage of our naval crews.
This is caused by the decline of ( our shipping. Sea
going offers no career satisfactory to American ambi
tion. It is necessary that this be changed.
Much is said about our protective policy as a cause
of the decline of our merchant marine, and the deep
sea primacy of Great Britain is cited as an effect of
free trade. This is a superficial view. We have followed
a policy of protection on land and free trade on deep
water. Great Britain has reversed this by having pro
tection on deep water and free trade on land. Her
subsidy and bounty system has given her merchant flag
primacy of the sea. Our protective system has given
us primacy in production on land.
mark this summer is ten feet lower
than that of last season, nor is the
property loss comparable to that of a
year ago, when the damage wrought
exceeded 520,000,000 and when over 100
lives were sacrificed. But in permanent
irjury to the productive capacity of the
region it may well be that the river has
delivered a second blow as serious as
was the first. The flood of 1903 was
the greatest since 1844. Until a year
ago the valley of the Kaw was as fer
tile as any on this continent. For cen
turies the. strips of woodland along
tht? banks of the rived bed impeded the
rush of overflows, and the silt that
built up thcrich land had been precipi
tated. But under agriculture the trees
were gradually cut down, in many
cases right to the water's edge. The
result was inevitable. In its natural
course the river runs rather slowly
and with many windings through it3
fiat meadows. But when it overflowed
the water swept straight down the val
ley. Unimpeded by trees, it increased
its velocity, in. some places cutting for
Itself new channels, and for almost the
whole 120 miles of the valley not only
deeply eroded the river banks, but
played havoc with the valuable farm
lands. In some places the rich soil was
cut away to the barren sands or grav
els: in others coarse sand was laid six
and eight feet deep over the fields; in
Ktill other places great holes were
gouged out and lakes formed acres in
extent. Of the 250,000 acres of remark
ably fertile lands, worth from $100 to
$T50 an acre, which the valley con
tained. 10,000 acres were completely de
stroyed for agricultural purposes, 10,000
acres more were damaged 50 per cent
of their value, and the whole area was
greatly depreciated in value owing to
the general sense of uncertainty as to
the future. That these fears for the
future were well founded the repetition
of the disaster makes sufficiently plain.
But the condition of the citizens of
the valley is far from hopeless If they
will put into active and general opera
tion plans for the protection and re
clamation of their lands. The Bureau
of Forestry has devised systems of tree
planting for the river banks, the sand
covered lands and the deeply eroded
lands. The object of the first is to pre
vent washing of the banks, to protect
the whole area from the full force of
floods, and in time of overflow to check
the tendency to gully and cut new
channels. The last two systems of
planting are for ultimately reclaiming
the now destroyed lands and making
them produce in the meantime a valu
able wood product while the work of
reclamation is going on.
The sanded lands are now useless for
crops, but will grow cottonwood, which
twenty years hence will make valuable
sawlogs. In the meantime the trees
will be reclaiming the land for field
crops. This they will do partly by the'
fertilizing effect of the decaying timber
litter. But should the flood waters re
turn again the timber would very likely
be in a position to render much greater
service. Examination of the area af
fected a year ago shows strikingly that
where protective grpwths of cottonwood
checked the rush of the current the
land beyond was generally covered not
with sand, but with silt, and is often
if anything more fertile than before.
With extensive planting of forest trees
another flood would undoubtedly bring
back at once to fertility much of the
land which now has been made barren.
The Bureau of Forestry is now send
ing to the citizens of the Kaw Valley
a mimeographed circular of recommen
dations for guidance in forest planting
on their damaged lands, in which it is
said:
"Wherever the river has changed its
course and straightened its channel
every possible effort should be put forth
to keen It straight. Much of the dam
age that was caused in the great flood
of 1903 is directly traceable to crooks
In the stream. The soft, bare banks
should be covered with willows at the
earliest possible moment to prevent the
stream from again becoming crooked.
In addition to. the protection of the
caving river banks and the reclamation
of the sanded and eroded lands, the
landowners of the Kansas River Val
ley should immediately co-operate to
secure continuous belts of timber 250
feet wide on both banks of the stream.
Such protective belts will be far more
serviceable than dikes of earth or ma
sonry in mitigating the destruction
that may occur from overflows. The
future v wealth and productiveness of
the valley as a whole will be largely
dependent upon the practice of for
estry for protection against devasta
tion by floods."

The low, vase-sliaped fruit trees were first made the
standard for orchards by California. They are now
common in the orchards of all continents. Modern fruit
growers calinot afford to use the old-time high trunk
trees that require spliced ladders to reach the fruit.
Time and labor are both too valuable for that. Trees
cannot afford to pump sap through several yards of fire
wood in the shape of useless trunks and branches.
California has led in "'the -matter of marketing fruit
products in foreign lands. Luther Burbank has given
California the leading place in the creation of new varie
ties of vegetation and he has worked with the require
ments of the world at large in view. Orchard and vine
yard protection from insect pests first reached systematic
attention and large development in this State. Insecti
cides and the employment of beneficial parasities have
insured the permanency and profitable pursuit of fruit
growing. '
The creation of competencies for thousands of Cali
fornia^ orchardists and vineyardists, the large and out
of-door life that may.be traced to fruit growing as an
occupation, the origin of beautiful towns and cities in
fruit growing districts, the abundant capifal that makes
for prosperity in California, the conversion of wild lands
into farms, the realization on a large scale of the ances
tral desire to sit under one's own vine and fig tree, the
attraction of desirable citizens from all parts of the
world to this State â these are among the 'benefits that
Professor Wickson attributes to the fruit and vine in
dustries.' --*~ ; \
There is no one who will deny that to the grower of
products of the soil in California the greater share of
present prosperity in this State is directly attributable.
Indeed, but for discoveries relating to the soil, all of
which were made by men interested in its cultivation,
there is little doubt that when the placer mines were no
longer greatly profitable the gold seekers and most of
the other people who came here during the early days
ofy California would have returned to the East or to
foreign lands. Great honor is unquestionably due to the
farmer, who, after the gold-seeking pioneers, may be*
termed the preserver of the State.

had already been translated into almost
all other languages.
Never realizing thatj her death was
so near, Miss Vallejo called her niece,
Miss Antonita Vallejo, to her side a
week ago and gave into the young
lady's hand a typewritten history of
the Vallejo family, saying at the time,
"My dear, it is well that you keep this
account of your ancestors. I have pre
pared it specially for you; guard it."
Miss Vallejo was born sixty years ago
in the Mission of San Jose, and up to
the hour of her death looked remark
ably young. She leaves a sister,' Mrs.
E. L. Kern, who lives at 51S Telegraph
avenue, Oakland: two nephews. Conrad
E. Kern and R. E. J. Kern, well-known
musicians, and a niece, Miss Antonita
Vallejo, "besides several cousins.
The funeral will take place this morn
ing from the Spanish church, Yglesia
de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, on
Broadway, between Mason and Taylor
streets.
Traffic on the coast line of the
Southern Pacific was delayed for an.
hour yesterday morning through the
derailment of the second section of
train No. 9, which is due at Third and
Town3end streets at 7:10 o'clock.
Both sections of the train had arrived
on 'time at San Bruno station and the
first section was moving on when the
tower man observed the second sec
tion also moving, contrary to the sig
nals. As a train from another direc
tion was due to dross the track on
which No. 9 was moving, the operator
promptly threw a switch Just in time
to catch the engine of the section, and,
although the latter was moving very
slowly, the engineer was undble to
come to a stop before the forward
wheels of the locomotive had gone off
the rails. A wrecking engine was sent
out from the yards and in a short
while had the derailed engine back oh
the track.

The trouble between the plasterers
and cement workers' unions as to which
had preferential rights in certain lines
of work was settled by the Building
Trades Council at its meeting Thurs
day.
The contentions were as to work on
lime and cement, both unions claim
ing rights which would in the natural
line of labor infringe one on the other.
To adjust this difference the council
decided that where lime forms a con
stituent element the plasterers had
preference and where cement is used
the cement workers were permitted un
der the decision to control all artificial
marble and stone work.
The members of the Butchers' Union
in San Francisco have made suitable

Reports from coast shipping agents
to the headquarters in this city show
that there is a dullness all along the
coast line, leaving quite a number of
seamen in search of vessels.
The Building Trades Council refuses
to recognize the credentials of Frank
Stradling, who was appointed agent
from the mills and factories affiliated
with the District Council of Carpen
ters, on the ground that this council
is not affiliated with the Building
Trades Council.

Miss Guadalupe Vallejo Ex
pires in This City After
Brief Illness.
MISS GUADAMJPE VALLEJO,
NIECE OF FAMOUS GENERAL.
WHO DIED YESTERDAY.
This is the fourth general fire here in
twelve years. It is believed that the
bank vault is intact. The origin of the
flames is unknown. A meeting of citi
zens has been called to prevent any
fra:..e buildings being erected.
SPOKANE, Wash., Aug. 5.â A
special from Kendrick, Idaho, ' says:
Fire broke out in the old Pacific
Hotel at 10:30 this morning and dfe
stroyed the whole business part of the
city. All the residences between First
and Sixth -streets and between the
bluff on the north and the creek on the
south are gone. The total is closely
calculated at $250,000, on which there
is about 50 per cent insurance.
An alarm was promptly turned in
and the department responded quickly,
but the flames were soon beyond con
trol. Five minutes after the fire was
discovered it jumped across Main
street and ignited the brick buildings
there. Several men were overcome by
heat and fainted in the street, but all
were carried to places of safety.
About thirty-six business houses and
twenty residences were destroyed.
Nearly all the business men have al
ready telegraphed to wholesale houses
for new stock and all are arranging to
rebuild.
BUTTE. Mont., Aug. 5.â A special
dispatch from Big: Timber, Mont., say*
a forest fire in the Crazy Mountains,
twenty miles north of Big Timber, has
done considerable damage in the last
few days. The fire started last. Sun
day, and has gradually increased until
it has burned overj a large stretch of
heavily wooded country. Parties in
town to-day from that section stated
that among the timber burned is some
of the most valuable in that district.
A 'dispatch from Kalispell says that
forest fires are still raging with una
bated fury in the timber lands of that
county, and from all reports received
thus far the damage will run into the
thousands of dollars. Small holders of
timber lands are the chief su/Cerers.
The fires are not raging in the
forests surrounding this city, but in the
finest lumber sections in Northern
Montana. The thickly wooded sections
about Atlanta, Sterling and Fisher
River are burning, as well as the tim
ber west of Lilbby and between Troy
and Eonners Ferry, Idaho.
About half, a dozen frame buildings
on the outskirts of White Fish have
been burned. The people living in the
timbered sections are all out fighting
the fire, but are almost powerless to
check its advances.

Ripon. near Stockton. The girl was
taken to the City and County Hos

Miss Alexander is eminently fit for

The annual regatta for the DlcWe
cup is scheduled In tha bylaws to bÂ«
raced on the second Sunday In August
A postponement was deemed advis
able, as the measuring of the yachts
would take some time. Only" stamped
boats can compete in this race, so H
was set at the last meeting: for thf
28 th inst.
Vice Commodore Henry London iÂ»
building a yacht which, he hopes tÂ«
have completed in time to compete or
the 28th. London is building the boat
along the lines of his Imp.
O. L. Seavey, one of the chartei
members of the club, has a boat about
completed. Seavey has built manj
small models, but this is the first om
of any size he has attempted. Hii
previous efforts have met with sue*
cess.
With the new set of racing rules,
which minimizes the element of lucfc
in pennant races, and with the meas
uring tank in operation, the model
yacht owners expect the races at
Spreckels Lake, Golden Gate Park. tÂ«
be more satisfactory than formerly.
In the past boats of all sizes and de
scriptions have met on even terms and
some of the smaller ones have stood
absolutely no show.
Measurer L. S. Adams Is busy meas
uring and stamping the yachts of thÂ«
San Francisco Model Yacht Club. HÂ«
expects to have them all measured be
fore the end of next week. Large and
small boats will still meet in competi
tion, but the latter will be given Â»
time allowance and thus the largt
boats will not win everything In sight
To-morrow -will be the last day ia
which the boats will meet without thÂ«
time allowance.
Large Fleet of Boats Will Compete
for the Dickie Trophy on

READY FOR CUP CONTES1
The ; next .tournament to be played
on. the Golden Gate Park ; courts is
scheduled-for the 14th inst. Entries
close on the 12th inst. It will be a
handicap doubles for the club cups.
j The class singles tournament, which
was completed on the public courts
The annual coast championship ten
nis tournament will commence on Sep
tember 2 at San Rafael and the cracks
are putting in every spare moment in
practice before the nets. It i3 more
than likely all of the challenge
matches will go by default. In the
me,n's doubles Bell and Freeman will
surely not defend. The latter is out
of the State. Bell, the singles cham
pion, is in the East competing in the
national championships and it is
doubtful if he will return in time. May
Sutton, the woman champion, is also
in the East and rumor has it that the
Suttons will not be seen at San Rafael
this year.
The absence of the Southern Cali
fornia champions will lessen the in
terest in the events. Championship
players in this part of the State are
rare. If the southerners stay away
the championship tournament will
simply resolve itself into a match be
tween Drummond MacGavin and
Percy Murdock. Reuben Hunt is ex
pected to arrive in time to play, in
which case the two cracks would have
no sure thing. Hunt was as clever as
either of them whe.i he left here and
he has undoubtedly improved in the
East. Another man who has signified
his intention of entering is Fritz Over
ton of Los Angeles. He is one of the
cleverest players on the coast. These
four would furnish some interesting
matches.
If the Suttons and Miss Dobbins do
not \enter the women's events they
wouM attract but little attention.
There are just three girls in the bay
counties who play any kind of a game
at all and the entry list would be
small. Miss Hotchkiss, Miss Edwards
and Miss Ratcllffe are the only ladies
possessed of much ability.
The tournament committee, antici
pating an unuually large entry list,
decided to start play on the 2d and
thus allow ample time in which to
finish the events. On the 2d the men's
singles and women's doubles will be
started. On Mon'day. the 5th, the
men's doubles will commence.
The challenge . matches will be
played on September 9 and 10.
The Oregon State championship
tournament opens on the 22d inst. at
Portland. The courts of the Multno

ship, while if Alameda wins it will
have a * percentage of .65, or only
l-100th below the Pacific .Club's .56,
San Francisco dropping to .44.
Rowing at Stanford University is
still in a bad way and no, signs of
speedy improvement are apparent. At
the end of June the water, which had
been sinking lower and lower in Lake
Lagunita, was drained off, as has been
done each summer. 'The lake is artifi
cial and, though hundreds of tons of
clay have been spread over the bottom
to retain the water. It is still leaky
and can probably never be made tight.
The crews of the University Boat Club
have hitherto practiced on the lake,
but will probably, try to" secure a boat
house on San Francisac' Bay, which is
three miles distant. .
F..J. Sherry, who won the outrigged
ekiff race in the. senior class at the
championship regatta and against
whom a protest was raised by the Ala
meda Boating Club for impeding other
competitors In their course, has been
awarded the first prize. ~ Though he
pulled wildly, and took the water of
each of his competitors in turn, he
neither fouled nor was fouled by either
of them. It was alleged that the Ala
meda representative did not ioul
Sherry because he was afraid of dam
aging the new Alameda racing skiff.
It is obviously absurd to claim the
benefit of a foul if no foul actually was
made.
The Dolphin Boating Club will also
have a representative in- the junior
outrigged skiff race in the Admission
day regatta. He will be selected by
competition.
The regatta to be held on Lake Mer
ritt as a part of the Native Sons of
the Golden West celebration of Ad
mission day will attract crews from
all the clubs except the Olympic Boat
Club, which has shown no signs of life
during the present year. The Dolphin
Boating Club will send two barge
crews, a junior and an intermediate.
The latter will pull in the senior race
also. The intermediate crew will be
made up of the same men that rowed
in the Fourth of July regatta. The
junior crew will consist of new men.

The members of the Corinthian
Yacht Club will cruise to Petaluma
drawbridge this evening, the tide run

Point and to a much later hour in
Petaluma Creek. Anchor will be
dropped near the bridge for the night
and to-morrow the fleet will return on
the ebb tide to moorings at Tiburon.
This evening the fleet of the California
Yacht Club, several of which returned
last Sunday from the annual cruise up
the Sacramento River, will sail to
Sheep Island, where fish chowder will
be prepared on the beach to-morrow.
To-day and to-morrow are open on the
programme of the San Francisco Yacht
Club. On Sunday, the 14th inst., there
will be aquatic sports at the club
house at Sausalito.
The Paciflc Inter-Club Yacht Asso
ciation will hold its first meeting of the
present season at the temporary quar
ters of the Merchants' Exchange on
Sansome street on Monday evening
next. The business of the past year
will be wound up and the association
will reorganize for the coming twelve
months. Commodore W. G. Morrow
recently appointed the regatta commit
tee of the San Francisco Yacht Club
as delegates "to the association. The
members of it are ex-Commodore R. S.
Bridgman, Roy C. Ward and C. M.
Gunn. The delegates of the Corinthian
Yacht Club are T. J. Kavanagh, M.
Brennan and F. E. Schober. The rep
resentatives of the South Bay Yacht
Club are S. E. Smith. E. L. Corbin and
T. E. Gibson. The Vallejo Yacht and
Boat Club will be represented by P. J.
Weniger and Carl Siebrand. It is
doubtful whether the Enclnal Yacht
Club will send delegates to the Asso
ciation or not. After organization has
been effected, the delegates will make
the preliminary arrangements for the
ninth annual regatta of the Pacific
Inter-Club Yacht Association to be
held on September 9.
It Is probable that the San Francisco
perpetual challenge cup, won by the
sloop Corinthian, which defeated the
sloop Challenger, the holder of the
trophy in the recent race, will be
turned over to the winning club on
Saturday evening next at the Cor
inthian clubhouse In Tiburon. The
trophy has not been in the custody of
the Corinthian Yacht Club since 1902,
in which year the sloop Challenger'
now owned by W. G. Morrow, won it
from the sloop Harpoon. The return
of the highly-prized trophy to the
Tiburon clubhouse will be made the
occasion of a jollification.

The match played last Sunday on the
Alameda ground resulted in a victory
for W. Jamieson's side over H. Rob
erts' eleven. As the teams were merely
picked up on the field, the scores will
not be reckoned in the batting or bowl
ing averages of the players. H. B.
Richardson is at the head of the tat
ting averages, with A. W. Wilding sec
ond, as on July 23, but Dr. O. N. Tay
lor, who has been absent on a fishing
trip in the Sierras, now stands at the
head of the bowling averages, Wilkes'
performance on July 24 having in
creased his average, while Dr. Taylor's
remained unchanged. The full details
are given below:

will meet the San Francisco County
team for the fourth time during the
present season. Now that the San
Francisco County team has been
weakened by the removal and defection
of some of its strongest players. It is
about on an equality with the other
two city teams, so that the result of a
contest being uncertain, more interest
is felt in it. The representatives of the
San Francisco County Club will be
chosen from the following: Harold 3.

count of the unplayable condition of
the Presidio links.
It is by no means certain that there
will be any contest for the open cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast. The ab
sence of players from the south will
render it impossible to hold a match
between teams representing Northern
and Southern California, so that the
only contests certain to take place are
those for the Del Monte cups, one for
men and another for women. Just
what competitions will be held will be
settled within the next few days. It
is possible the meet will be held dur
ing the week of the 22d to 27th inst.,
as the races to be held by the Auto
mobile Club of California on the 26th
and 27th on the Del Monte track will
attract many visitors at that time.
Though a few players continue to
practice on the Presidio links, the
course has been so much cut up by
cavalry drills that no competitions
have been held by the members of the
San Francisco Golf Club for several
months. On the new course at Ingle
side such work is being done as can be
accomplished in the dry season, burn-
Ing off grass and weeds and stubbing
up bushea. "When the first rains come
In the fall the task of laying out the
course will be prosecuted vigorously.
The winning of the British amateur
championship of 1904 by Walter J.
Travis has drawn much attention to
the aluminum putter used by him
and known as the "mallet" or
"Schenectady" putter. Many great
Scotch golfers still use the old-fash
ioned wooden . putter, among them
being James Braid, Andrew Kirkaldy,
Willie Fernie, Archie Campbell, H. H.
Hilton and Arthur Balfour. The Iron
headed putter is the one used by Harry
and Tom Vardon, A. Herd, W. H. Tay
lor, J. E. Laidlay, Horace G. Hutch
inson and most of the best known mod
ern golfers. The aluminum or "mallet"
putter has been known in England for
more than two years, but there had
been no demand for it. Since the vic
tory of Travis the firm of English mak
ers received orders in a few days- for
nearly two hundred dozen. Nearly
& year ago six dozen were sent out
from London to Hongkong and the
putter is much used in Australia (the
native country of Travis) and New
Zealand. The English retail dealers
! do not dwell much on the merits' of the
aluminum putter, as they have large
stocks, of iron putters on hand, but
they admit that they receive many
inquiries for the new club.
The* makers of the "mallet" say that
Its weight is concentrated at the point
where the shank enters the base, en
abling the player to judge his stroke
tetter and preventing the putter from
turning in the player's hands. The
putter weighs 10 oz. 2 dwts. The won
derful putting of Walter Travis Is,
however, to be attributed to his skill
more than to the club he uses. The
material of the head and the weight
of the putter are not wholly respon
sible.

Vallejo is to have the best meeting
in its history, judging from the big
lift of entries received for the races,
which start at the navy yard town
Wednesday and which are as follows:
A high class filly appeared in the
two-year-old pacing division of the
Breeders' Futurity stakes on Thurs
day in Delilah, a daughter of Zolock.
She marched the second heat of her
rn.ee in 2:16U. which is thÂ» fastest
mile paced in the United States by a
tuo-year-old this year. Delilah is
owned and was bred by Ben Davies of
San Bernardino. She could doubtless
a mile close to 2:12 if kept in
-training until fall. Her sire. Zolock,
.seemed to realize the great speed of
his first born to race and in the 2:10
pace on the same day reduced his rec
ord from 2:10'i to 2.09U-
Dexter Prince, the grand old stal
ilon which was used at Palo Alto
Ftock farm for many years and is now
the property of A. B. Spreckels, got
a new 2:10 performer when his son,
Lisonjero trotted to a record of 2:0SU
at Buffalo this week.
â¢The San Jose meeting: will close to
day with a big programme and .1 rec
ord breaking crowd is assured. Many
Â¦vi\] go fro:n this city.
.The fastest trotter that has an-
I^.ir^d on the circuit bo far is the bay
pelding: Ole. owned by Grace Bros, of
Santa Rosa, and trained and driven
by John Quir.n. Ole took a record of
2:1 1U at San Jose this week and
"Koks as if he might enter the 2:10
class when he hits the Santa Rosa
track. He is by that old time favor
ite race horse, Silas Skinner, 2: IT, and
Kis dam is the Â£reat brood mare Eve
line, by Nutwood, which has produced
four with records better than 2:22.
The pacers Kelly Briggs and Zo
lock both entered the 2:10 list at San
J<ise on Thursday in the came race.
Kelly Briggs is the first 2:10 perform
er for his sire. Bayswater Wilkes,
owned by Samuel Hoy of Winters.
.Zolock's mile in 2:09'i makes him the
twelfth 2:10 performer for his sire,
McKinney.

10Eddie Hanlon was introduced and
the spectators went wild with enthus
iasm after "Cute" had concluded a
cleverly worded : little speech.
Mike McBride and Jim Bradley
fought the prime battle of the night,
McBride finally getting his man in the
third. It was rough going all the
way, with both men swinging and
landing so often that each would have
quit had he been given a peep at a
feather bed. Al Elkins and Abel La
bel fought two tame rounds, when the
referee stopped the bout and warned
the men to fight." They did better dur
ing the next' two and Label' was given
the decision. .
Joe Kelly outpointed Jack Doyle in
a good go, and Mike Kutchous put
Billy Brennan out of the going in two
spasms.
The best that "Charles Augustus
could do last night when he faced Lew
Powell in Mechanics' Pavilion Annex
was to stall around for three rounds,
take a bad beating and then go down
so often that the police were forced
to stop the bout.' Powell had to much
class and again demonstrated that he
is the peer of any. lightweight fighting
around these parts. The go was the
main event of the Lincoln Club's show
and drew a full house.
There were rumors of fake and dou
ble cross after Joe Larkin hit Bob
Cairns a terrific smash on the jaw
that put him in the land of blissful
memories. Cairns was winning and
had things easy when in the third Lar
kin crossed him with his right and
that gout was no more. It was tipped
that Larkin was to take the count,
but double-crossed his man. Both
boxers denied this.

SARATOGA, Aug. 5.â In addition to
the defeat of five favorites, the features
of to-day's racing were the two races
won by "Woodford Clay. The first was
a six-furlong handicap, won by Flying
Ship, which was much the best in the
race. She was badly hampered all
around the far turn and again at the
last furlong pole her rider, Helgesen,
took desperate chances to get through
the rail. Flying Ship won by a
head from Shrine.
The plunge of the day was made by
Messrs. Gates and Drake on the latter's
filly, Ocean Tide, which was making
her first appearance this year. More
than $20,000 was wagered on Ocean
Tide by Messrs. Gates and Drake. Mr.
Pratt, the Buffalo plunger, bet heavily
on Shrine, while Armenia was also well
supported. The bulk of the money bet
on Flying Ship was for third- place, al
though Mr. Lewisohn had |500 on her to
win at 12 to 1.
Mr. Clay's second victory came in the
fourth race, a handicap over the turf
course, for which Grand Opera, with

was the Clay representative, and she
was backed down from 15 to 1 to 8 to 1.
The Musketeer and Xew York made all
the running. At the head of the stretch
New York drew clear, but Outcome,
which left the barrier next to last and
had gradually made up her ground,
came on in pursuit. The contest was ex
citing and ended in' a head victory for
the Kentucky mare. Grand Opera was
never dangerous, though he was a fair

It was three straight against the j
Commuters yesterday at Recreation
Park. They were blanked all the way
and never had any ginger after San i
Francisco thot three over in the initial |
round. After that, there was no scor- \
Ing, although lots of hard drives were j
Boused about the field. Score, S to 0. !
Barber had everything, intruding
conSdence, to make the Oaklanders
quU. This they did before the game
was well begun. Occasionally they got
men on the bases, but then Barber be
came stronger than ever and the Com- |
miners were powerless. McKune could
hit only a little dinky bounder to Bar
ber with the bases full and two down
in the seventh.
That first inning was an auspicious
une and the resound of those wallops
can be heard about Eighth street yet.
Caldron died on a grounder, but Hil
iicbrand put a "Texas leaguer" out to
right field. Meany drew a pass. Cy
Townsend blnged a rollicking two
eacker out to left and both runners
came in. Anderson followed the cue
of Cy and it was three rtght there.
After that round, Graham pitched
good baseball and was aided by luck"
and by three clever double plays. IHls
fielders all played the game and no
errors happened. Moskiman was sent
In to bat for McKune in the ninth with
two gone and he responded with a
safety to right field. Francks ended
the agony by striking out.
Oakland got just as many hits as the
hnme team, but none of them counted.
Of the twelve bingles lined out In the
gajne, eight of them were for double
the distance. Anderson came through
with two of these. Julie Strelb also
annexed a pair. Gorton made a couple*
of good catches out In left field that
undoubtedly cut oft runs. Graham hit
t.he ball an awful wallop every time
he came to the bat, but he had no
luck. Twice he lined it right to Gor
ton and in the ninth inning he shot the
leather directly to Anderson on a per
fect bound. The score:

PONY RACING ASSOCIATION
ABANDONS TWO 3IEETINGS
Owing to Lock of Entries There Will
Be No Gatherings at Santa Bar
bara or Del Monte.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 5. â Secre
tary T. A. Driscoll of the California
Polo and Pony -Racing Association
announced to-day that the race meet
ing of the association scheduled to
take place in Santa Barbara on the
25th and 27th Insts. had been called ofC
on account of the small number of
owners who were able to send ponies"
and horses here. Mr. Driscoll has just
returned to his summer home In Santa
Barbara after a flying trip to San
Francisco in the interests of the asso
ciation. The absence from the coast
of some of the most influential mem
bers of the association and the small
number of ponies in training by the
other members effectually defeated
the plans of the association.
The polo tournament to be held
by the association In Santa Barbara on
the 17th. 18th and 20th will be held
as originally scheduled. Mr. Dri3coll
stated positively that there would be
no meeting of the association at Del
Monte this summer, as he did not con
sider it would be fair to Santa Barbara 1
to cut its dates In favor of the former
place.
RABBITS* FEET FAHj TO
SAVE HORSE TRAINER
diaries Pleasant, a Negro, Wins and
Lioscs Ten Thousand Dollars
and Then Hangs Himself.'
With three rabbits' feet in hia
pocket for good luck Charles Pleasant,
a negro, went into the Sutro forest
back of Ingleside yace^rack yesterday
morning - and hanged himself to a
Monterey cypress tree. The branch
to which the rope was fastened was
not more than five feet high and when
the dead body was found the knees
of the corpse were only a few inchej
above the ground.
Pleasant came to this city about
eight years ago from Chicago with
$10,000 that he had won on the races.
Similar speculation on, T tliis_ coasc

He had been employed recently as
a horse trainer for W. B. Jennlnga

COOK OLSEX DEMANDS
DAMAGES FROM SHIP
Says That Mate Genesen Beat Him
on Board the Schooner Sehome
Without Just Cause.
- James Olsen, /formerly cook on
board the schooner Sehome. filed a
suit yesterday in the United States
District Court against the schooner to
recover $1000 damages and $357 al
leged to be due as wases.
Olsen alleged that he shipped at
San Pedro for Puget Sound and on
one occasion during the voyage N. P.
Genesen, the mate, beat and abused
him. The complaint charges that
when Olsen complained to Captain
Mattlson the captain requested him to
go to a place where ships do not sail
and to get out and walk upon tho
waves if he didn't like his treatment.
The rude language and unsympa
thetic attitude of the skipper, Olsen
says, made him sick, but he thinks
that $1000 in United States gold cola
will enable him to convalesce In good
style. The complaint does not stata
why the mate beat the cook, whether
It was that the corned beef hash was
not to his liking or whether Olsen
gave him some hot sauce that waÂ»
not on the bill of fare.
Manila Customs Collections.
For the year ended June 30, 1904.
the customs collections at Manila
amounted to J7.140.803 47. During
the same period at this port the cus
toms collections were $7,448,881 97.
An incident illustrative of the care
lessness that at times characterizes
Jeff's work occurred two days ago. The
big fellow x was not satisfied to work
in the ordinary way with the immense
sandbag, but held the 350 pounds on
his head, much to the apprehension of
the training crew. During his shadow
boxing yesterday he was in dangerous
proximity on several occasions with a
weight machine.
Jeff was out on the road this morning
for a four-mile spin and returned In
good shape.
Joe Kennedy has been troubled with
a sore ear for several days, and this
has deferred the boxing.
Jim is rapidly rounding into condi
tion and could go twenty rounds with
out further work. Delaney says the
champion Is In such fine fettle that he
would be satisfied to allow Jeff to go
to New York and back before the fight.
Jeff Indulged in a game of baseball
yesterday afternoon, which was fol
lowed by a rubdown. He rests and eats
well and his wind is almost in perfect
form.
HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 5.â Jeffries,
the champion pugilist of the world, who
knows not the meaning of fear in the
ring, has been frightened by a bee.
During his gymnasium work yesterday
Jeff discovered one of the members of
the "honey trust" buzzing contentedly
around the room. It was somewhat
amusing to see the perturbation the in
sect caused the big fellow. He sus
pended training operations until the
bee had been killed.

BAN JOSE, Aug. 5.â The two-year
oid trotting and the three-year-old
pacing divisions of the Breeders' Fu
turity were the features to-day of the
Pacific Coast Trotting Horse Breeders*
Association meet. There was an in
creased attendaince over yesterday.
The bookmakers did a good business.

A field of eight started In the two
year-old trotting division of the Breed
ers' Futurity, for which a purs* of
$1450 was offered. All the heats re
sulted In close races. North Star won

won easily by Bell Mont, with North

In the 2:25 class pacing stake. This was
a good race, Hattle Croner pressing the
winner hard in all three heats.
More than ordinary interest centered
in the three-year-old pacing division of
the Breeders* Futurity. The three en
tries, Seymow M, My Way and Frisk
arlna, met last year at Petaluma in
the two-year-old division of the futur
ity. At that time Seymow M won,
with Friskarina second. My Way was
distanced. To-day the tables were
turned. Friskarina was the favorite,
and took three straight heats. My Way
was second and Seymow M third. This
was the best race of the day. The
horses were bunched all around the
track and the finishes were close.
The meeting closes to-morrow with
the third division ot the Breeders' Fu
turity, the 2:24 trot and the 2:14 pace.

CHICAGO," Aug." 5.' â Clifton Forge,
the crack colt in Ed Corrlgan's stable,
carried the green and white to another
victory to-day In the third and feature
race at Harlem. The game little son
of Handsomc-Illisee picked up 115
pounds, gave away weight to every
thing in the -race and then won as he
pleased with a length to spare. He ran
the mile in 1:41 flat and finished with
plenty in reserve.. â¢
This race was one of the best Clifton
Forge has run this season. Robin Hood,
with only 97 pounds up, took Clifton
Forge by the head during the first five
furlongs, but-at the bend , for home
Songer let out a link on the Corrigan
colt and he shot to the front with a
lead of three and a half lengths. When
straightened out for the wire he still
had a clear lead of two lengths and, un
extended, won b*y an open length.
Clifton Forge was always the choice,
opening at 6 to 5 and closing at 11 to

The Grass Valley Union furnishes
some information that may be inter
esting to the stockholders in "the
Niagara mine, situated in the Rough
and Ready district in Nevada County.
This mine was formerly exploited by
Letson Balliet. The Union says:
Inquiries have been received here lately ask
ing as to the condition of the Niagara mine in
Rough and Ready district. The inquiries are
mainly from Iowa, by perrons who are stock
holders In the Niagara Mining Company. They
want to know whether the mine is running
and when It will pay dividends. Several of
the inquirers state they are poor people who
invested their savings, of years In the stock
on the strength of representations made by
Letson Balliet, who promoted the mine. A
gentleman who visited . the mine ' a few days
ago In order to Intelligently answer an inquiry
from the East says that the Niagara mine and
mil! are both idle, and have not been running
since last January or February. There is a
watchman at the mine, and the Cornish pumn
Is kept going to keep it drained. The owners
of the property are, or at least were until very
recently. It is saM, In San Francisco, confer
ring with the company, which latter, it is un
derstood, is endeavoring to make a deal where.
by the Niagara Mining Company will acquire
full title.
Incidentally It U noted that * Sao Fj*nclÂ»cÂ»
The new mill of the Central mine
in Nevada County has been started.
It is a forty-stamp mill. Twenty
stamps are dropping. The capacity of
the mill Is to handle 120 tons of ore
every twenty-four hours.
CONCERNS THE NIAGARA.
A discovery of supposed importance
is the finding of an old river channel
about one mile from Weaverville,
Trinity County. The Red Mountain
Mining Company has been operating in
that vicinity. The Redding Search
light gives an account of the discovery
In part as follows:
Numerous shafts and tunnels penetrate the
mountain side. Some of them came near hit
tins; the mark, but when the more effective
hyaraulic process was applied a few bedrock
cuts up tha mountain side exposed the channel.
It emerges from the mountain side at a slight
angle with tha axis of the mountain, and,
after losing the protection of Its mountain
cover, has been broken down and eroded
away. A number of the old-time attempts to
find It were made above and along this broken
down portion under the erroneous assumption
that it was still under the mountain.
Its bottom has been cleared for a dis
tance of 100 feet, and under the Influence of
the overflow stream its contents throughout
the next 400 feet have broken down, exposing
the clean face of Its outer rim. This caving
down extends across the channel for a. dis
tance of 200 feet, and its Inner rim has not
yet appeared, except at the point of discov
ery.
From the discoveries now made the following
facts are established: The grade is gentle
and the flow in a southerly direction. The
width of the channel from rim to rim is about
800 feet. The highest part of the rim yet dis
covered is more than 100 feet vertically above
the bottom. Its outer rim haa been definitely
located for a distance of 15C0 feet intact, and
the trend of the stratification lines indicates a
tctal distance of half a mile of Intact channel.
Through a portion of this distance it is capped
by a mountain of gravel 300 feet high. The
gravel that has thus far been piped from" the
channel has yielded some heavy gold. The
channel bottom is elevated aproximately COO
feet above the present Trinity River channel.
T. L. Smith of Sutter County, who
lives ten miles east of Yuba City, has
bonded a ranch of 320 acres to James
O'Brien Jr. of Sutter County, to be
prospected for gold. The Sacramento
Bee says:
The Brat intimation Smith had that the
precious yellow metal existed down deep in
hi* soil was several weeks ago, when he was
boring two wells on the place. Me was sink
ing the wells about fifty feet apart, and when
his men had gone about twenty-five feet below
the surface they brought up black sand show
ing traces of gold. This rather excited Smith,
and, to nuke sure that his eyes did not de
ceive him, be took the samples of sand To a
local mining man. who agreed with him that
It wan gold-bearing sand such as is usually
fcund in old river channels. In a few days a
proposition to bond his land was made by
O'Brien. He asked for sixty days' time in
which to make the test, and expects to put
drills to work on the land within tha next
week or so. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦â¢ Â¦''--Â¦
i: truth Is confident that at some time the
Feather Rlvtr had a well-denned channel
through the part of the country where it is
now believed the gold exists. It is also the
opinion or many that the FeathÂ«r at one time
flowed through what is now the Tuba City
Elough. Should O'Brien's investigations prove
that tinÂ»re is gold In paying quantities under
the land he has bonded, Sutter County may ex
perience a boom in cold mining â an industry
no one ever imagined would ever develop in
this low, level country.
the same property at an advance.
Large figures are mentioned' as the
price on the resale, ranging from
$250,000 to J325.000. The Mammoth
mine ts two and one-half miles south
west of Kennett, in the Backbone min
ing district, about fifteen miles from
Redding. It embraces a group of
claims including something like 9Â°Â°
acres. A large amount of ore has
been blocked out. A mile of tunnels
has been run and $40,000, according to
reports, has been expended in develop
ment work. It is locally supposed
that a smelter will be erected on the
property soon.
In Nevada County a deal has been
made by which Henry Huckins, Shelby
H. Huckins, Robert F. Huckins and
Alfred Scrivens take the Round Moun
tain and Round Mountain Extension
Quartz mines under bond. The prop
erties are situated on the Lower
Bloomfleld road, above Rock Creek,
not far from Nevada City. The sell
ers are James Landers and Henry
Goering.
Of more general interest is the leas-
Ing of the somewhat famous tin mines
at Temescal, in Southern California.
The mines are to be operated again.
The Redlands Review says of the
Temescal proposition:
George I, Leonard of Corona, a mining and
electrical engineer, is in charso of reopening
the famous tin mines at Tcmeacal, the big
property that a dozen or so years ago made
and lost so much money. Mr. Leonard says
that be and his associates already have a email
plant at work on the property, having secured
a twenty-year l*ase from the EngliBh owners
of all the mining Interests connected with the
property and an option to purchase the claims
as well. The present force of men and tho
present plant are engaged in working over the
tailings which the former owners discarded,
and Mr. Leonard says they are getting a nice
profit out of the tailings, which are rich in
tin, the methods of the former manage
ment not having been such as to ex
tract nearly ail the valuabiÂ« mineral from the
concentrates. None of the concentrates have
yet been smelted, as the smelter put in by the
former owners will be utilized, and it is so
large as to require a big run in order to make,
lti use economical. Accordingly no smelting
will be done until a large amount of concen
trates has been accumulated. A force of seven
men is uon' employed and tha management
hopes to Increase this number soon, when a
crushing plant shall have b?en installed, and
ore. not tailings, shall be handled. But the
6000 tons of tailings, now on the dump offers
a jrreat deal cf profitable work for the present
and nets a good return.

the Redding papers to have been pur

seph Kahny by Fred G. King and
John Filllus of Denver. The pur

A special correspondent of the Seat*
tie Times writes from Nome as fol
lows:
Mine owners are now facing the shortest
season in the history of the camp. Besides a
noticeable shortage in water for sluicing pur
poses the ground is frozen to n great depth.
Mining has practically been at a standstill
since, the first boats arrived. In the last two
weeks work has picked up on several of the
creek* in the vicinity of Nome, and should
there be a late spring the gold output may
equal the record of 1903. Operators at Nome
are now looking forward to heavy rains. In
the winter months the snowfall was unusually
light. The ground was left .without protection,
and In some places it has frozen to a depth
of sixty feet. Building in the town of Nome
has been out of the question and lcÂ« has been
encountered at a depth of two feet under
ground. Before the first boats reached Nome
thii season the operators were confident of
an early season. In fact, indications pointed
that way. The light snowfall has lÂ«ft the
ditches without the customary supply of water
and there is no snow In the mountains to
melt should there be heavy and warm- rains.
In the early part of the present month there
were four days of rain, but the fall will not
be of much benefit to the miners unless the
rains continue for some weeks. A visit to
the various creeks reached by the Nome and
Arctio Railroad immediately conrlnces most
any one that work is not being .'prosecuted.
Operators have machinery on the ground and
labcrers are waiting to go to work, but it
1b a question if the ground will break up in
time tr warrant the operators spending their
Urn? and money sluicing the gravel.
It Is when bedrock is reached that the
dredger proves its greatest effectiveness, for
It is in the crevices of the bedrock that pock
ets of gold are most likely to be found. The
rubmarlne diver, with his hose with water
under 100-pound pressure, turns on the Jet
that Bweepa every particle of gold toward the
mouth of the rock pump column. The radius
of its effectiveness is 2% feet.
The dredge is easily shifted to new ground
when desired. The company has three miles
of river bed and its richness is beyond ques
tion. Middle Creek produced millions in early
days for the placer miner. The gold that the
creek carried into the Sacramento has never
been touched before.
The shaft is lowered, literally, as work pro
gresses until bedrock is reached. At Middle
Creek the bedrock Is 23 feet below the river
bed. which is a like number of feet below the
surface of the water.
Suppose operations are about to commene*.
The steel shaft is extended down through the
water to the gravel on the river bed. The rock
pump is started hoisting the gravel on the
boat, where it Is run over sluices, as In all
placer mining. The pump handles a cublo
yard of gravel a minute and enough water to
wash It. Rocks up to a diameter of 9% Inches
are pumped up as readily as a pebble. The
largest rock pumped was 9% Inches In diame
ter and 17*4 inches long, weighing 58 pounds.
The submarine divers work in the shaft or
outside, at pleasure, and may remain under
the surface half a day at a tlmo if necessary.
When boulders too large for the pump are
encountered they are hoisted in the manner
previously described â if up the shaft, the diver
rteps out through the door at the river bot
tom for safety, in case the boulder should
break lcose from its lashings; If on the out
aide of the phaft. the course of the diver Is
reversed.
Down this shaft passes the 10-Inch column
of a rock pump and also & 2-lnch rubber hose,
through which water may be forced at 100
pound pressure. This water Jet is made to
clean out cracks and crevices In the bedrock.
Boulders that are too large for the pump to
handle are at present hoisted to the surface
in buckets or by ropes, the submarine dlvera
at the bottom doing the loading. This labor
will be obviated when a section of the river
bed has been cleaned up. Then the bonlders
will be rolled back upon the section that ha*
been mined.
Something novel In the shape of a
gold dredger is now operating in the
Sacramento River at Middle Creek,
three miles above Redding. The Red
ding Searchlight Bays of the ap
paratus: ;Â»
This distinctive advantage Is that It cleans
up the gold from the cracks and crevices In
the bedrock under any depth of water as per
fectly as a housewlfa can brush up dirt from
cracks in the floor. In Its operation submarine
divers can work on the river bottom. watch-
Ing the work going on and seeing that every
pocket of gold is conveyed to the surface. No
scoops or shovels are used. All hoisting is
done with & rock pump. The boat Is 65 feet
long and 24 feet wide and draws two feet of
water. Through tht bottom of the boat Is
sunk a steel shaft. In sections, to any depth
required. This working shaft is, roughly S^
feet by 11% feet, a cross eection being boat
shaped, the prow pointing up stream to break
the force of the current. The two bottom Mo
tions arc cyllndrisal. the one that rests on
the river bed being provided with a water
tight door for the Ingress and egress of the
diver.
According: to the Yreka Journal
considerable is going on among the
mines of Siskiyou County. A strike
of good prospects has been made
about fifteen miles from Nolton and
the claim has been bonded to Mr.
Staple of Ashland for $125,000. The
Journal continues:
The great Blue Ledge copper mine In Elliott
Creek district is fifteen miles from Nolton,
Klamath County, from which point a wagon
road could no doubt be built as easily as to
build down into The Elliott Creek
mines are ell on this side of the divide at the
Oregon boundary, and are destined to 'prove
the busiest mining camp in Siskiyou when that
section is thoroughly developed and opened
with trade avenues. Mining is carried on suc
cessfully day and night in the Minetta B and
Williams Point claims near Happy Camp. O.
G. M. & W. P. Company (Van Brunt mine),
Happy Camp district, has about closed a suc
cessful season. When the mine closes for sum
mer extensive Improvements are to be made.
The Pacific States Mining Company, two miles
from Nolton, will during August finish the
flume which is to convey bank water to their
new diggings, and have started work on the
upper Hume to furnish water. Mining is prose
cuted very successfully in the Classic Hill
mine at Happy Camp, worked by Captain
Mulllns representing a Los Angeles company,
with John Wood superintendent of mining oper
atlona The Mount Vernon group of quarts
ledges at the summit of the divide between
Greenhorn and Cherry creeks, about a couple
<-f hundred yards east of the stage road, is
now worked with a good force and the prospects
are very encouraging. The company has built
a piece of roai around the hill to tha mines
and has had a survey made toward securing
a patent, with the intention of putting up a
mill on further development.

NEW YOHK. Aug. 5.â There was a decided
contradiction of bui-lnees In storks to-day.
Commission houses reported the amount of out-
Bide orders as insignificant and the speculative
operators showed hesitation and uncertainty.
This U partly due to a Urge diversion of
speculative Interest to the cotton and grain
rr.srketÂ« and partly to the conflicting influences
from the cotton and. wheat crop prospects.
The effect cf thene iÂ« to cause alternate ad
vances and declines in the markets as a whole.
as the effect of the cotton prospects or the
vheat prospect becomes alternately dominant.
There Is very alight tendency for the move
ment* lr the cotton carriers and the wheat
carriers to diverge. The result is to cause
constant uncertainty as to what course prices
may take. The undertone of the market was
firm to-day. Accordtng to the explanation of
the room traders, who had the market large
ly to themselves, thta was due to the fact
that. they found rery light supplies or stocks
for s-ri'r. So far as the produce markets werÂ»
An influence there was a feeling of suspicion
cf j-wterday's violent rise in wheat and the
rÂ«portÂ« of damage to thÂ« crop which accom
per.i'd it. The reaction in the wheat market
Itself encÂ«n inured the view, that the fright over
the situation had been exaggerated. The views
of the Â«xtest of the damage to the spring
wheat crop, however, became so. mixed that

NEW YORK -MINING STOCKS.
The principal river steamer with fresh sup
plies of Potatoes was very late again and the
market was . unsettled during the early trade
in consequence, but when the consignments
brought by the belated boat were finally un
loaded trade was active and the best 'stock
was quickly cleaned up at steady prices. Sup
plies of Salinas Burbanks were limited and
generally of poor quality and previous prices
ruled for that line of goods. A small consign
ment of Sweet Potatoes came In from Merced,
the first of the season from that region, and
sold at 3%c per pound. River Sweets brought
3c and come from Coachella sold at 6c per
pound. Onions ruled weak at unchanged
prices. Two carloads of fancy stock were re
ceived from San Luis Oblspo and were held at
$1" 50 per cental, but no nates were reported.
Vegetables continued to arrive freely and
were generally weak, with large lines of ,all
descriptions to be had at the inside rates.'.To
matoes cleaned up. as the low prices attracted
a certain class of trade, but prices were no
higher, as dealers were anxious to clean up
In anticipation of continued heavy receipts.

Peaches were still the leading feature of the
market for deciduous fruits and. although trade
was less active than on the preceding day.
prices were firm, aa receipts were lighter. The
canners were taking small lots of Freestones
at $25(5.15 per ton, while the regular trade
purchased freely at the quotations. The belief
is current In fruit circles that the opening
prices for Clingstones will be high, and one
dealer predicted that owing to the shortage in
the river sections they would bring $60 per ton
before the end of the season. Wrapped Bart

while bulk stock was firm, with the cannera
cleaning up the market at the 'previously

were received and sold at nominal prices. The
Apple market was gradualy working Into
shape, and a few small lots of extra fancy
stock commanded a small premium. Plums
and Prunes were plentiful and the market was
firm for good shipping stock, but there was a"n
abundance of low-grade offerings, which could
be bought at low prices. Nutmeg Melons sold
at a wide range as to quality, a considerable
portion of the heavy receipts being green and
otherwise poor Two carloads of Seedless
Grapes, packed' In 45-lb boxes, came in from

CHICAGO, Aug. 5. â At the . opening the
wheat market showed some signs of weakness,
September being unchanged to %c lower at
96%@07%c. With the exception of favorable
weather, however, there seemed little to war
rant any alteration of the recent bullish atti
tude of traders. Prices at Liverpool were
again up about Id compared with yesterday's
close. Private advices from the Northwest re
ported further damage by the rust blight. In
fluenced by the strength In English markets,
shorts covered freely soon after the opening,
advancing the price of September to 98Vic A
â¢julck reaction followed as a result of heavy
profit taking. ' On the break September de
clined to 00%c. The bearish turn to the mar
ket '.was clinched by a report of a Minneapolis
crop expert, who has within the past two
weeks sent out numerous extremely bullish
advices regarding the condition of spring
wheat In the Northwest. According to the in
terview given out to-day by this authority,
while wheat in the Dakotaa and Minnesota Is
damaged by rust, there will be, on the whole,
an excellent aggregate production with much
variation In sample. Many reports received
during the day from the Northwest, however,
were flatly contradictory In tenor. The pit
crowd seemed willing to believe the worst that
could be said of the spring wheat crop, and In
consequence little momentum was needed to
again start prices upward. The advance met
with small offerings until September- had
reached 99 He. Renewed liquidation, especially
in the more distant futures, caused another
reaction, September declining to 97%c. The
market closed rather easy, with September at
07%Â«397Â»ic. Â«
Profit taking by Eastern holders was !n
strumentnl in creating a weak . undertone in
corn. The market closed weak, with prices
near the lowest point of the day. September
closed at 52%@52'4c.
The oats market followed corn In preference
to wheat, a weak undertone being In evidence
the greater part of the day. September closed
at 33%c, the low figures.
Provisions were weak In âmpathy with
lower prices at the yards and on selling cred
ited to local packers. Trading was more ani
mated than of late, but the volume of business
was r.ot large. At the close September pork
was off 17%c, lard was down 7%@10c, ribs
closed 7%c lower.

I many operator* express a determination to
await the publication of the Government esti
mates of the condition, which Is to appear
on the 10th, before venturing on further com
mitments. The engagement of $2,600,000 In
gold for shipment to Europe next week and
rumor* of further engagements seemed to be
accepted with perfect equanimity by the stock
market. The shipment to Cuba is of such a
special character and has been so clearly
foreseen that it was totally Ignored, but the
movement to London Is regarded an an indi
cation that the usual recourse to that center
for funds to move the crop 'will be denied
this fall. The money market was entirely
unaffected. The estimates of the week's cur
rency movement shows that the tide *rom the
interior is uninterrupted and the large loss
to the eubtreasury with which the week opened
on account of the payment of a Central Pa
cific note has been successively reduced by" the |
daily debte of the "tJovernment institution. A |
gain of over $3,000,000 in cash by the banks is
indicated.
The sharp recovery of Consols in London
helped the early market here. Reactions at
the last were only elight, but the closing was
heavy.

WHEATâ The foreign markets were firm.
with Liverpool and Paris futures higher.
There is a growing opinion that chances are!
bright for a good demand on this country dur
ing the rest of the year. Reports from Russia
are becoming more unfavorable, and' those
from the Danube are getting gloomy. Le Petit
Journal of Paris estimates the French crop at
310.000.000. bushels, or 55.000.000 below last
year.
Chicago continued excited and bobbed about
a good deal, declining from 97^c to 96%c.
rising violently to 99 %c and falling back to
Â»7%c. T^he riie was helped along by the re
port that Armour was tying up September de Â¦
liveries. Wires to E. F. Hutton & Co. said
that increasing reports of rust, extending over
an expanding area, on top of a big European
shortage, make an acute situation. But Jones
of the Commercial West sent In a more bear
ish crop estimate and the crowd sold on it.
the pit crowd dumping a lot of Wheat. New
York also sold.
The Chicago wires of R. Brent Mitchell said:
"It was -a very irregular market, with wide
and rapid fluctuations. Foreign markets only
partially followed yesterday's advance here.
The feature of the day was a report sent out
by Jones of the Commercial West, which,
while Intimating damage, was much less radi
cal than had been the current estimate formed
from scattered reports. The action of the
market for the day* indicates ' considerable
liquidation, and this was no doubt due to the
above report. So far as advices from commer
cial channels are concerned, they do not show
much change, although perhaps there was less
reiteration to-day. Cash markets are all
strong and higher. A continued active and un
settled market is likely. Developments In
the Northwest will be watched closely. Think
we would buy Wheat on sharp breaks. Cable
advices from Important European centers are
most unfavorable as to general crop situation."
In this market futures did not respond to the
Chicago excitement and were lower, and the
sentiment of local operators was more bearish.
The cash grain continued firm but quiet.

On April 13, 1901, the Southern Pa
cific Company commenced the laying
of a track along First street and an
nounced that . warehouses would be
built as soon as possible, thus per
manently obstructing the thorough
fare. When the citizens of Pomona
learned of the plan they turned oui
In force and put the corporation's ser
vants to flight. Many .heads wert
broken before this was accomplished
and for a time much more seriou;
trouble was threatened.
The Southern Pacific Company ther
appealed to the courts for damage:
and an injunction restraining the citi
zens from interfering with the cor
poration's work. . The lower court de
cided in favor of the city and th<
higher tribunal affirms that decision
It is held that the road was in oper
and notorious use for thirty years anc
that the -railroad should have pre
sented its claims earlier if it hoped t<
prove title to the highway.
The citizens of Pomona used First
street as a highway aa early as 1871.
In 1875 the Supervisors of Los Angeles
County laid out and recorded Flrsi
street aa a public thoroughfare. The
agents of the railroad were shown tc
have recognized the claim of the citi
zens at various times, although the
corporation was never officially noti
fied that the street was made public.
The Supreme Court handed down a
decision yesterday denying the claim
of the Southern Pacific Company to
the title to First street in the city of
Pomona. It is held that the corpora
tion allowed its rights to lapse, if it
was ever possessed of any in the prop
erty in dispute. The action of the
citizens in using force to maintain
their rights is upheld.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany acquired title to the twenty acres
of which the thoroughfare consists by
purchase from Louis Phillips in 1873.
The property was subsequently trans
ferred to the Southern Pacific Com
pany, assignee of the other corpora
tion. * â¢ â¢

done it. His plea was provocation suf
ficient to warrant the attack, Hurley
having addressed to him a most of
fensive epithet. The hearing will be re
sumed to-dav.
The witnesses to the will v.ere W. S.
Wood, Reuben H. Lloyd and Frank F.
Bostwick.
It is set forth in the will that Crocker
had organized the Sierra Investment
Company and purchased in its name
a lot on the southeast side of Market
street, eixty feet southwesterly from
the corner of First street and extend
ing through to Stevenson. Upon this
lot he contemplated soon to commence
the construction of a modern building
and says: "If at the time of my death
the building is not commencd or com
pleted, my direction is t!.at my execu
tors* shall complete said structure."
"My express direction Is that they
shall' not be hampered or restrained
in aiding or assisting in the construc
tion of and payment for the contem
plated structure, but shall be facilitat
ed In every way in obtaining means to
that end." ry.W-^/-'.
"In dividing my estate between my
wife and son, I direct that my wife
shall have the right to take out of my
estate, at market valuation, such bonds
as she may deem best, excepting the
stock of the H. S. Crocker Company,
of which Ehe may take her share."
He gives the wife and son the right
to borrow money. Incur indebtedness,
mortgage or give property as security
and, out of his interest in the Sierra
Investment Company, to advance
mtraey for the payment of the building
for which he provides. The will says:
Charles H. Crocker shall pay $5000 to
Emma W. Curtis, $5000 to Henry
Crocker's niece. Nettie Cornwall, and
$5000 to Lizzie E. Platt. To his broth
er-in-law. Arthur Swinnertori, he
leaves 150 shares of the\H. S. Crocker
Company or $10,000 in lieu thereof.
The will continues with the following
clause:
Next, in the will, he said that as he
understood the law, a one-half interest
in his estate would be vested in his
wife. He confirms this understanding
of the law and gives her all of the
household furniture, etc.
To his son, Charles H. Crocker, he
leaves the remaining half of the es
tate, subject to the payment of the
other charges and legacies. The son
is directed to pay to his father's sis
ter, Sarah E.. McKee, $600 a year until
the estate is distributed. He makes
this provision "for the purpose of pre
venting the estate from being embar
rassed or the title to any of it 'being
clouded."
In the first instance Crocker de
clared that all of his estate was the
community property of himself and his
wife.
The will of Henry S. Crocker was
filed in the probate department of the
County Clerk's office on Thursday, to
gether with the petition for its admis
sion to probate, but the documents
were immediately removed and not re
turned for public inspection until yes
terday.
The will of the millionaire, who died
at the St. Francis Hotel on July IS
last, at the age of 72 years, was dated
December 20, 1001. He appointed his
wife, Clara Ellen Crocker, and his son,
Charles Henry Crocker, executors
without bonds.

The pension was allowed In October.
1S00. In April. 1902. he was allowed
a pension of ?60 a month, the latter
Sum being on his salary as captain for
three year?. Hogan died on March 14
cf this year from the result of illness
contracted and injuries received in the
service. His widow demanded pay
ment of the pension and It was re
fused, hence her suit for a writ of
mandate to compel the payment.
Hogan qualified as a fireman in No
vember. 1895. In September, 1900,
hÂ«? was physically incapacitated from
attending to his duties and asked to
be retired on a pension of 54 0 a
month, half of his salary as a hose
man.
A euit which promises to be a test
case as to the liability of the firemen's
pension fund for the payment of pen
sions tt> the widows of deceased fire
men was commenced yesterday in the
Superior Court by Phoebe F. Hogan,
vhose husband was a hoseman and
later a captain in the Fire Depart
ment- She asks the court to compel
the firemen's pension fund to pay her
the pension of $40 a month which her
.husband had received before his
death. The suit is directed against the
Board of Fire Pension Commissioners,
John D. Barrett and other members
of the board.

McKenzie's next move was to try to
locate the Ashton family, but he was
surprised to find that no such family
lives on Washington street Hoping
that Annie might return^ to . the St.
Francis, McKenzie patiently loitered
about the establishment the greater
part of yesterday and finally was ad
vised to report the case to the police.
Meanwhile he had notified the young
jgirl's relatives of the fact of her-dis
appearance and received a response to
exert every possible effort to find her.
The missing girl is of fair complexion,
rather attractive and. according to
McKenzie, is engaged to marry a prom
inent young man of Santa Barbara.
The mysterious disappearance from
the St. Francis Hotel last Tuesday of
Miss Annie Baker of Santa Barbara is
deeply concerning her friends and rela
tives. Yesterday one of her friends,
"William McKenzie of Monterey, who
arrived here late Thursday in search of
the young woman, failing to gain any
trace of her. acted on the advice of the
hotel people and reported the case to
the police. The missing girl .Is 17 years
of age and has been living with her
mother in Santa Barbara,' where she
was' employed by the telephone com
pany as an operator.
Two weeks ago she journeyed north
to Monterey to visit the wife of Mc-
Kenzie, of whom she was a school
chum. Sunday night, according to the
statement made by McKenzie to the
hotel clerks yesterday, Annie received
a letter from this city which she
claimed was from a family named Ash
ton, living on Washington street, in
viting her to spend a few days with
them.
She left Monterey on the afternoon
train on Monday and, arriving here
late that evening, went to the St. Fran
cis Hotel, where, for some reason
which is yet to be explained, she reg
istered under the name of Mabel Bond.
The next day she left the hotel" and
that was the last seen of her. The
young girl left her trunk with the Mc-
Kenzies in Monterey and had very lit
tle money with her.
Wednesday a young man of Monterey
with whom Anne was acquainted, re
ceived a note from her briefly announc
ing her arrival in this city and stating
that she was staying at the St. Fran
cis Hotel. The letter was turned over
to the McKenzies, who, knowing that
their young acquaintance was not pos
sessed of sufficient funds to permit her
to stay at a hotel and, recalling that
Annie had stated that she purposed
visiting friends here, became suspicious
that all was not right and on Thursday
McKenzie came to this city to find
the girl. Inquiry at the hotel devel
oped the fact that no one by the name
of Baker was there, but a description
of the girl led to the discovery that
she had registered Under the name of
Mabel Bond.

but Suddenly Disappears
Mary Tobln, sharp of . feature and
tongue, denied that Rio Nieble,- swart
and slow of speech,; was. struck by all
the household â¢ articles â¢ she â¢ hurled at
him, but acknowledged, that she scored
more hits than misses. Yes, she be
lieved .she could .average seventy-five
bullseyes out of a possible hundred,
although she had' never kept even a
mental tally of her shots. But. she
wouldMike to : have the court under
stand that she did not do all the throw-
. J. ,H._ de . Acavadoc,, an Ecuadoran,
was sent by Judge Conlan to answer
a forgery charge in the Superior Court,
with . bail set at $2000. . , The defendant
is accused of having obtained money
from several persons in this city by
means of forged .drafts from banking
institutions in his native republic.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Sixteen-year-old Ruth Brown meekly
promised to be- a good little girl and
obedient to her stepsister, Mrs. Esther
Donaire, if Judge Conlan would kind
ly let bygones remain bygones and re
frain, from sending her to a public in
stitution for the restraint of â¢ revolu
tionary maidens. His Honor severely
scolded Ruth for provoking Mrs. Don
aire to enlist his aid in the enforce
ment.of discipline and then continued
the case- until next Wednesday, advis
ing Ruth to be on her very best be
havior during the interim, else she will
surely be consigned to a reform school.
Mrs. Donaire, Who lives at the St.
Kathryn Hotel, stated that she is
Ruth's only guardian and that the girl
recently acquired a habit of disobedi
ence and following her own inclination
in the matter of violating the curfew
ordinance. ' When remonstrated with
she flew into a violent rage and the
immediate cause of the ward's arrest
was a severe trouncing which Bhe ad
ministered to Mrs. Donaire because
that lady chlded her for staying away
from home until after midnight and
failing to satisfactorily explain where
she had been. The guardian subse
quently ascertained that her ward had
spent the evening /with a' bartender
and that some of the places visited by
the couple were not of the character
that unsophisticated girls should be al
lowed to enter.
During her'recital Mrs. Donaire was
deeply affected. While she felt that
the child was getting beyond her con
trol and in imminent danger of going
astray, she shrank from having her
committed to an institution for' way
ward girls. That the Judge keenly
sympathized with, the woman was
shown by the sharpness with which he
reproached the defendant, who seemed
to realize that she had acted very in
discreetly.
"So conflicting is the testimony," he
said, "that only a Solomon could hear
it and then form a logical conclusion.
If no evidence at all had been adduced
I might be able to guess whether the
defendant did or did not whip the
horse, but the more witnesses I heard
the less capable I became of venturing
a just guess and now I'm utterly un
able to even form a conjecture. There
fore a continuance for two weeks is
ordered and the next hearing will be
before Judge Fritz, who, with mind
refreshed by vacation and unconfused
by the evidence, should be able to
guess an honest decision right off the
reel." - ? â¢
In th*e meantime Rice is at large on
his own recognizance.
Then came a veterinary surgeon to
explain the pathological features of the
case. His post mortem examination of
the horse satisfied him that death was
directly attributable to the injuries in
flicted by the cable car, but he declined
to swear that other injuries that might
have resulted fatally had not been re
ceived by the animal immediately prior
to the collision. To the best of his be
lief, however, based upon an extended
experience In the treatment of horses,
the beast in question did not die from
the effects of a whipping.
At this point of the proceedings the
Judge asked- the chief prosecuting at
torney if the case were one of equity
and if the owners of the cable car were
liable to be dragged in as lntervenors,
to which the attorney replied that as
the case had gone beyond his control
he' did not dare predict what, it might
evolve. Then spake the court.
Milton Rice, vegetable peddler, was
driving a horse that collided with a
cable car at Sutter street and Grant
avenue. The horse was killed and Mil
ton\Rice was before Police Judge Ca
baniss yesterday morning on a charge
of cruelty to animals. Half a dozen at
torneys and about a score of witnesses,
including several policemen, were con
cerned in the case, and the hearing
consumed' an hour of the court's valu
able working time. Then it was contin
ued for two weeks, when more wit
nesses will be ready to testify.
According to the evidence for the
prosecution Milton Rice, seated upon
the wagon, whipped the horse most un
mercifully while it was proceeding
down , the declivity on Dupont street
which extends from Pine to Sutter. Un
der the lash the animal, although aged
and somewhat decrepit, dashed along
so speedily that the driver was unable
to check it when he tried to avoid the
fatal collision.
Contradictory of the foregoing was
the statement of Milton Rice himself,
corroborated by witnesses galore. Rice
stated that he had no whip on the oc
casion referred to and that he did not
administer corporal punishment to the
horse, but orally urged it onward to
keep It from being overtaken by the
wagon, which could not be stopped
from , going down the hill of its own
accord because of. a defective brake.
On the cobble pavement between Pine
and Bush . streets the vehicle bumped
along -with increasing momentum un
til it arrived at the asphaltum sur
face below, and there the horse started
sliding and continued to slide until
stopped by the car at Sutter street.
No,, the horse's name was not Kelly,
nor did Mr. Rice know of any reason
why it should have been. Of one thing
he was absolutely positive, and that
was the absence of a whip from his
driving equipment. His employer
strictly prohibited the whipping of his
equine property. Nor was the slack of
the reins utilized as a lash, because
the reins were not long enough to per
mit of such use.

; ing of dishes and bric-a-brac that for
eight years last past has frequently
routed ; harmony ' from 827 Jackson
street, where she and Rio dwell to
gether, though not in wedlock. Rio
did hot remain a passive recipient of
her fusillades, she said, but fired back
with aim even more accurate than
hers. As to his declaration that his
cranium bore furrows, made by dishes
caromed off it by her, she could show
some evidences of the excellence of his
marksmanship, "but she did not desire
to make an exhibition of herself unless
Judge Conlan were unwilling to take
her word for it. Judge Conlan hastily
decided that her word was as good as
her bond, and Clerk "Pat" Grey looked
disappointed.
Socontradictory, in every detail were
the statements made by Mary and Rio
that the court continued the case and
expressed a yearning to hear the testi
mony of Patrolman Skaln, who arrested
the woman on the man's complaint and
is believed to be strictly impartial as
between them.
Henry Lagreen was accused of bat
tery by August Berger, head janitor of
the Emma Spreckels building, and the
defendant admitted the battery and
pleaded strong provocation. He was
employed to assist Berger, he stated,
and when he became tired of obliging
that person with money loans, which
were never repaid, he was discharged.
"Then I gave him a thump," Lagreen
added, "because he was the meanest
man I had ever met." Judge Cabaniss
Imposed a fine of $5.
Charles A. Landis, a former police
man, who was recently fined $300 for
beating the woman' who is suing him
for divorce, appeared before Judge
Conlan as defendant in a case of bat
tery, the complainant being his broth
er-in-law, John Hurley. Landis saved
attorney's fees by pleading his own de
fense, and he examined and cross-ex-
