TAFT PARTY
ON THE WAY

Secretary Leaves
Japan for San
Francisco.
He Believes Anti-Peace
Reports Have Been
Exaggerated.
Statesman Says Chinese Have
Lost by Boycott and Are
Tiring of It.
YOKOHAMA, Sept. 17.-Secretary of
War Taft and party sailed at~3 o'clock
this afternoon for San Francisco on the
steamship Korea, amid Japanese* en
thusiasm. Secretary Taft was given a
reception this forenoon at the Ameri
can Consulate by local merchants.
IJefore sailing Secretary Taft said that
he thoug-ht that reports of the Japanese
anti-pence demonstrations had been
la^'eatly exag-gremted In America. He
and his party had traveled all through
Japan and had found no trace of any
anti-foreign or anti-American feeling.
While a prominent American party had
been involved in a.Tokio mob demon
el ration, he thougrht that it was be
cause the party happened to be caught
in the mob, and not because they were
Americans. Other churches besides
American churches had been burned.
There xca.*- Â« special reason In each
case, but :jo general anti-foreign feel
injr whs responsible.
Secretary Taft said that he had cx-
tlie Chinese 1 boycott closely.

ANGRY BULLS
WIN FIGHTS
WITH WOMEN
Female Matadors, Un
able to Kill, Tossed
by Animals.
Special Disnatch to ThÂ« CalL
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 17.â Upwards of 1000
persons seated about the bull ring at Tia
Juana this afternoon saw Elvira Segovia
tcssed over a bull's head and a little
later saw her sifter, Maria, knocked
twenty feet through space by another
enraged animal.
Elvira and Maria Segovia were the
natadoras, and it was their work that
did not please the audience. What they
lacked in skill, however, they made up
In courage, and though the bulls knocked
them all over the . ring when they tried
to give the death stroke, they were up
on the Instant and , ready for another
affray. The banderilleras were Romana
end Angela Segovia, two other sisters,
and Lolila Domingsky, and their work
was applauded by the audience.
The first bull was assigned to Senorita
Elvira, and she was given permission
to kill. The first stab she missed and
fell in front of the beast, and Manuel
Bravo and Antonio Barrera, the men, of
the troupe, had. to bait the bull away.
The girl was up for a second attempt,
but missed the stroke again. * The third
stroke was properly 'directed,; but .was
not forced far enough. In four other at
tempts the girl Bucceeded only in prick-
Ing the side of the animal's neck. . '
At the eighth attempt the animal
caught the girl on his head between the
horns and threw her high in the air. She
fell on her side and lay motionless for a
moment, but was up once more, j The
crowd cried to have the weapon taken
away from her and she gave it up. The
bull was permitted to leave the ring
\u25a0wounded, but not mortally.
To Maria was assigned the second bull,
and she made a little speech In which
she b wore to make a safe kill. Her
first and second thrusts she missed and
at the third was knocked down and rolled
over until the crowd called for her. to
give up the weapon and she did so with
out reluctance. The third, bull was as
signed once more to Elvira Segovia, but
she succeeded in driving the sword only
half way home and one of the men had
to finish the stroke.
The five girls are all young, not one
appearing over 20- They are from Juarez
and are studying the profession under
Bravo and Barrera, 1 who are past masters
In the business and toy with the bulls
as they would with a . spaniel pup.

Joseph W. Folk, Governor of Missouri'
and one of the most talked-of men in this
country to-day,, arrived here yesterday
from Portland,' where be attended .the
celebration of Missouri day at the exposi
tion. He is accompanied by Mrs. Folk.
hl3 private secretary and the members of
his military staff. The Western tour of
the man who has made himself so promi
nent throughout the country by his stub
born fight against political . graft has
been regarded by some as part of a plan
to boom him for the Presidential nomina
tion on the Democratic ticket three yeara
hence, but this is denied by all the mem
bers of- his party, and in a quiet way by
the Governor himself, who Insists that
the only- purpose of his coming West Is
to represent his State in an official way
at the Portland Exposition, and to inci
dentally see some of the" far Western
country. . â¢
Governor Folk positively refuses to dis
cuss'political matters in so far as, they
bear upon his own future or the .relations
of other prominent Democrats with the
choice of -the Presidential candidate of
his party. r He" would not deny. that he has
ambition '< in " the direction of the Presi
dency.' but be; refused to discuss the ques
tioru>.He,was:: also ; silent-- regarding ,th*
recent 'slump 1 1n - "the. â¢ Democratic " vote of *
Missouri, andVould not say a word about
the,; probable stand of William Jenntnga
.Bryan, in: the event of Missouri present
ing its Governor's name to the next Dem
ocratic ' Irrational Convention.
PRESIDENTIAL BOOM.,
-J That a boom for i Folk -is fomenting in
the West has been suggested several
times lately, more particularly at the re
cent reception given Folk in Salt Lake
City, where Judge W. H. King, at a ban
quet, declared that the West was ready
to indorse Folk for the nomination^ i ana
a -few days ago In Portland, when Gov
ernor , Chamberlain, ' a ' Democratic leader,
remarked during a speech that "the West
has come to that state of growth. where
her rights to recognition in the selection
of a Presidential candidate are no longer
disputed," and he then proclaimed, the
Governor v of Missouri as the Democratic
choice."
These Incidents, coupled with Folk's
fight against the grafters in his own
State, his frequent addresses before thB
Chautauquan conventions, and the fact
that he has avcepted an invitation to
speak in Philadelphia upon the subject of
municipal reform at a time when that
city is hardly recovered from Its fight for
cleaner government, are regarded , by
many as Indications of the ambitions be
ing fostered by the man who has well
earned the -title of the "Nemesis of
Graft." '
'â¢ Although extremely silent on political
matters of a national character. Governor
Folk talks freely ' en the subject of the
gi after and the boodler. his definitions of
the two being Interesting.
As he sat in his apartments at the St.
Francis he quietly /discussed the subject
that has brought him- into public notice,
saying: ' .
-"The boodler takes money directly and
violates the law, while the grafter some
times stands on the side of the law and
reaches over. .
"All the States of the Union, except ten.
are now engaged in the prosecution of
grafters and bribers. : This does not in
dicate a moral degeneracy, but a moral
awakening of the* people. For fifty years
prior to the Civil ..War. public attention
was centered on the, subject of slavery.
For nearly % forty years after the war. pub
lic thought was engaged In" settling prob
lems arising out of that conflict. White
attention .was directed to 'other matters,
corrupt men mada of public office a priv
ate -. graft. . , . Bribery became so common
that it ; was ;the accepted ' thing in many
States." A man gave a bribe and thought
nothing (of it* Men took ' bribe* and did
not s conceal the . fact and all this tima
the public \u25a0 conscience was asleep.
PEOPLE BECOME AROUSED.
- "Finally the people awakened to the
fact; that, bribery strikes at:, the â¢ heart of
free government i and - if tolerated would
give a* government not of and . for '.'_ the
people, but of and for "a* few, ; who" have
wealth enough to purchase official favors.
Then i came the stern determination to
stamp " out â¢Â« the offense. The people are
now demanding that . a public office .be
held as a public trust and not as a private
snap. Unless the spirit of civic right
eousness dies out, and ,' I don't think *it
will, weare coming to an age of higher
ideals in public - and . private life. , The
ambition of -the young men of the coun-'
try. is becoming more to get right than, to
get rich. . bWHPhMBI
"It'used to be that corrupt men. when
attacked, would hide behind, the shield of
their r party, but the" people no longer
permit i. political : parties .to be .used "as , a
cloak for villainy. They recognize" that
a rascal Is a rascal still, whether he calls
himself a Republican <or a Democrat.
Political parties are , necessary under our
form of government, but Uhey, should be
second to the people and not. the -masters.
Partisanship is a ,'good-i thing. , but ,when
partisanship ' conflicts - with -patriotism,
the 5 latter ; should . prevail 'Â« A "man who
would put party advantage ! above the
welfare of ', his i- State la a traitor to his
State.'"/; y'''2'~ : ' : '- - - : *&'

YOKOHAMA, Sept. 17.-Secretary of
War Taft and party sailed at~3 o'clock
this afternoon for San Francisco on the
steamship Korea, amid Japanese* en
thusiasm. Secretary Taft was given a
reception this forenoon at the Ameri
can Consulate by local merchants.
IJefore sailing Secretary Taft said that
he thoug-ht that reports of the Japanese
anti-pence demonstrations had been
la^'eatly exag-gremted In America. He
and his party had traveled all through
Japan and had found no trace of any
anti-foreign or anti-American feeling.
While a prominent American party had
been involved in a.Tokio mob demon
el ration, he thougrht that it was be
cause the party happened to be caught
in the mob, and not because they were
Americans. Other churches besides
American churches had been burned.
There xca.*- Â« special reason In each
case, but :jo general anti-foreign feel

ANGRY BULLS
WIN FIGHTS
WITH WOMEN
Female Matadors, Un
able to Kill, Tossed
by Animals.
Special Disnatch to ThÂ« CalL
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 17.â Upwards of 1000
persons seated about the bull ring at Tia
Juana this afternoon saw Elvira Segovia
tcssed over a bull's head and a little
later saw her sifter, Maria, knocked
twenty feet through space by another
enraged animal.
Elvira and Maria Segovia were the
natadoras, and it was their work that
did not please the audience. What they
lacked in skill, however, they made up
In courage, and though the bulls knocked
them all over the . ring when they tried
to give the death stroke, they were up
on the Instant and , ready for another
affray. The banderilleras were Romana
end Angela Segovia, two other sisters,
and Lolila Domingsky, and their work
was applauded by the audience.
The first bull was assigned to Senorita
Elvira, and she was given permission
to kill. The first stab she missed and
fell in front of the beast, and Manuel
Bravo and Antonio Barrera, the men, of
the troupe, had. to bait the bull away.
The girl was up for a second attempt,
but missed the stroke again. * The third
stroke was properly 'directed,; but .was
not forced far enough. In four other at
tempts the girl Bucceeded only in prick-
Ing the side of the animal's neck. . '
At the eighth attempt the animal
caught the girl on his head between the
horns and threw her high in the air. She
fell on her side and lay motionless for a
moment, but was up once more, j The
crowd cried to have the weapon taken
away from her and she gave it up. The
bull was permitted to leave the ring
\u25a0wounded, but not mortally.
To Maria was assigned the second bull,
and she made a little speech In which
she b wore to make a safe kill. Her
first and second thrusts she missed and
at the third was knocked down and rolled
over until the crowd called for her. to
give up the weapon and she did so with
out reluctance. The third, bull was as
signed once more to Elvira Segovia, but
she succeeded in driving the sword only
half way home and one of the men had
to finish the stroke.
The five girls are all young, not one
appearing over 20- They are from Juarez
and are studying the profession under
Bravo and Barrera, 1 who are past masters

Â§ WAVE GROWS
Joseph W. Folk, Governor of Missouri'
and one of the most talked-of men in this
country to-day,, arrived here yesterday
from Portland,' where be attended .the
celebration of Missouri day at the exposi
tion. He is accompanied by Mrs. Folk.
hl3 private secretary and the members of
his military staff. The Western tour of
the man who has made himself so promi
nent throughout the country by his stub
born fight against political . graft has
been regarded by some as part of a plan
to boom him for the Presidential nomina
tion on the Democratic ticket three yeara
hence, but this is denied by all the mem
bers of- his party, and in a quiet way by
the Governor himself, who Insists that
the only- purpose of his coming West Is
to represent his State in an official way
at the Portland Exposition, and to inci
dentally see some of the" far Western
country. . â¢
Governor Folk positively refuses to dis
cuss'political matters in so far as, they
bear upon his own future or the .relations
of other prominent Democrats with the
choice of -the Presidential candidate of
his party. r He" would not deny. that he has
ambition '< in " the direction of the Presi
dency.' but be; refused to discuss the ques
tioru>.He,was:: also ; silent-- regarding ,th*
recent 'slump 1 1n - "the. â¢ Democratic " vote of *
Missouri, andVould not say a word about
the,; probable stand of William Jenntnga
.Bryan, in: the event of Missouri present
ing its Governor's name to the next Dem
ocratic ' Irrational Convention.
PRESIDENTIAL BOOM.,
-J That a boom for i Folk -is fomenting in
the West has been suggested several
times lately, more particularly at the re
cent reception given Folk in Salt Lake
City, where Judge W. H. King, at a ban
quet, declared that the West was ready
to indorse Folk for the nomination^ i ana
a -few days ago In Portland, when Gov
ernor , Chamberlain, ' a ' Democratic leader,
remarked during a speech that "the West
has come to that state of growth. where
her rights to recognition in the selection
of a Presidential candidate are no longer
disputed," and he then proclaimed, the
Governor v of Missouri as the Democratic
choice."
These Incidents, coupled with Folk's
fight against the grafters in his own
State, his frequent addresses before thB
Chautauquan conventions, and the fact
that he has avcepted an invitation to
speak in Philadelphia upon the subject of
municipal reform at a time when that
city is hardly recovered from Its fight for
cleaner government, are regarded , by
many as Indications of the ambitions be
ing fostered by the man who has well
earned the -title of the "Nemesis of
Graft." '
'â¢ Although extremely silent on political
matters of a national character. Governor
Folk talks freely ' en the subject of the
gi after and the boodler. his definitions of
the two being Interesting.
As he sat in his apartments at the St.
Francis he quietly /discussed the subject
that has brought him- into public notice,
saying: ' .
-"The boodler takes money directly and
violates the law, while the grafter some
times stands on the side of the law and
reaches over. .
"All the States of the Union, except ten.
are now engaged in the prosecution of
grafters and bribers. : This does not in
dicate a moral degeneracy, but a moral
awakening of the* people. For fifty years
prior to the Civil ..War. public attention
was centered on the, subject of slavery.
For nearly % forty years after the war. pub
lic thought was engaged In" settling prob
lems arising out of that conflict. White
attention .was directed to 'other matters,
corrupt men mada of public office a priv
ate -. graft. . , . Bribery became so common
that it ; was ;the accepted ' thing in many
States." A man gave a bribe and thought
nothing (of it* Men took ' bribe* and did
not s conceal the . fact and all this tima
the public \u25a0 conscience was asleep.
PEOPLE BECOME AROUSED.
- "Finally the people awakened to the
fact; that, bribery strikes at:, the â¢ heart of
free government i and - if tolerated would
give a* government not of and . for '.'_ the
people, but of and for "a* few, ; who" have
wealth enough to purchase official favors.
Then i came the stern determination to
stamp " out â¢Â« the offense. The people are
now demanding that . a public office .be
held as a public trust and not as a private
snap. Unless the spirit of civic right
eousness dies out, and ,' I don't think *it
will, weare coming to an age of higher
ideals in public - and . private life. , The
ambition of -the young men of the coun-'
try. is becoming more to get right than, to
get rich. . bWHPhMBI
"It'used to be that corrupt men. when
attacked, would hide behind, the shield of
their r party, but the" people no longer
permit i. political : parties .to be .used "as , a
cloak for villainy. They recognize" that
a rascal Is a rascal still, whether he calls
himself a Republican <or a Democrat.
Political parties are , necessary under our
form of government, but Uhey, should be
second to the people and not. the -masters.

JUDGE PARKER
SCORES M'CALL
Says New York Life's Presi
dent Was Xot Only Con
tributor to Campaign Fund
MEX WITHOUT HOXOE,
Trust Funds Used to Corrupt
the Electorate and Defeat
the Will of the People
ESOPUS. X. V.. Sept. 17.â Former Chief
Judge Alton B. Parker, last year the
Democratic candidate for President of
the United States, to-day referred to the
charges made by him in the Presidential
campaign last fall, -that corruption funds
were being used in aid of the Republican
campaign. To a correspondent who
called at Rosemount. Judge Parker's
home, and asked. if -he had anything to
say in relation to the statement made
by Vice President Georgre W. Perkins of
the New York Life Insurance Company
before the Legislature committee investi
gating the insurance business, to the ef
fect that President John A. McCali of
that company had caused a contribution
of $50,000 to be made last year to the
Republican national campaign fund.
Judge Parker, said:
Yes, I believe I ought to Â£*y. now that
there iÂ« no poiivicai excitement to attract pub
lic attention, that the president of the -Ne-sr
York Life was not the only â¢ subscriber. The
officers of the other life insurance companies,
such as the Equitable and the Mutual, also
contributed from the policy holders' funds for
calr.fjalgn purposes last year. !
What has been proved in the case of the
XtÂ»- York Life probably will be proved In the
other cases. The facts exist and honest and
able counsel, backed by an honest committee, j
undoubtedly will bring them out for the public
EOoJ.
Were there en investigation of the railroad,
manufacturing and other corporation*. It would
be found that these life insurance officers were
not the only corporation officers who put their
bands Into the treasury and took out Â»oneys
belonging to widows and orphans to help se
cure a partisan triumph.
CORBUPTI.VG THE ELECTORATE.
That their acts were unlawful and their pur
poses corrrupt goes without saying. They in
tended to have the money used, as it was. In
corrupting the electorate. ; Mr. Perkins makes
the point that John A. McCali. the president
of the New York Life, is a Democrat. Ap
parently he would have the public assume that
whÂ«i McCaJl unlawfully and wrongfully con
tributed the funds â the company's share, prob
ably as a member of the underwriting syndi
cate â it was evidence of political virtue rather
than misconduct.
The truth about it Is â and I say It without
feeling, but emphatically â that men like Mc-
CaK have no political convictions that stand
In the way of their personal advantage. Such
men <ies-ire the triumph .of that party which
will better Â«erve their personal financial Inter
ests and will â for contributions, past, present
and future â continue to protect these Interest*
by lenient legislation and by pretense at exe
cution of law which shall be tenJerly blind to
all rhelr citenses. That party- they espouse in
the board room and contribute to it the moneys
they hold in trust, and. occasionally, a little
of their own.
The undei lying principles which divide the
preat rcass of the people into parties have no
effect ui>on euch men. Their own Inquiry Is,
Will the party organization, in Its hour of
triumph, remember our generosity and respond
to our demands? Of course, the organization
does remember, for it expects a similar con
tribution next time; and the contribution is
not in vain.
Euch contribution has been made before In
national. State and municipal elections. The
officers responsible, for these raids upon the
treasuries of corporations have received their
reward in unfettered management of ' life in
surance corporations: in unembarrassed raids
upon the public through trusts, condemned by
both common and statute law; in refusal to
punish criminally the officers of railroad and
other corporations violating the laws, and In
statutory permission to manufacturing corpora
tions to levy tribute on. the people.
PUBLIC CONSCIENCE DULLED.
There can be no hope of checking the un
lawful aggressions of officers of great cor
poration* so long as they may thus form a
quasi-partnership with the organization of the
dominant political party; for. in the hour
when the administration official seeks to pun
ish tbe offender, he is reminded by the head
of the organization of the magnitude of the
contributions of the corporation.
| There Ic. however, something worse. If pos
sible, than the escape of such offenders from
justice. It is the gradual demoralisation of
voters and the dulling of the public conscience,
caused by the efforts to make these vast sums
of money procure the ballot they were Intended
to procure, corruptly and otherwise. ' -
Jt is my purpose to claim that the Democratic
party, subjected to the temptation which has
overcome the other party during the last few
years, would have acted differently.
Mere party advantage should not be sought
frcm the disclosures made In this investiga
tion. But the facts should be diligently sought
that the people may become so aroused that'
they uill Insist upon legislation making It a
criminal offense for officers to contribute cor
porate funds for political purposes and de
priving the apparently successful candidates of
their office*.
- Efforts in that direction have been making
in different States elnce November last and
particularly In this State. But the Republican
organization would not consent to It, bo the
Legislature defeated the bills. And the or
ganization never will consent until an aroused
public sentiment shall threaten legislators
with political oblivion who fail to enact effect
,lve laws upon the subject.
JEROME TO ATTEND INQUIRY.
Will Prosecate Insurance Men If the
Evidence Warrants It.
LAKEVILLE, Conn., Sept. 17.âDis
trict Attorney Jerome, -who will return
to New York to-morrow, signified his
intention to-night of attending the
Wednesday session of the Armstrong
Insurance committee, at which George
W. Perkins will resume his testimony.
s On the subject of the recent testimony
by Perkins before the Armstrong com
\u25a0mittee. he said:
\u25a0 "I am not going to conjecture
\u25a0whether a crime has been committed
or not in the matter of a campaign con
tribution by an insurance company. I
have not seen the official record. Civil
suits for restitution may, of course, be
brought by the Attorney General or an
Interested party, but a criminal prose
cution would largely depend upon the
question of the intent with which the
act was committed."
"Will you take any step in the direc
tion of criminal prosecution?" Jerome
â¢was asked.
â¢ "I shall hare the testimony, of
course," he replied, "and If that shows
.that any crime has .been committed I
fhall certainly prosecute. That goes
without easing."
COXSnJERATE ' TOWARD MORGAN.
Kins* of Wall Street Not Likely to Be
Called as a Witness.
NEW YORK. Sept. 17. â A forthcom
ing phase of the legislative insurance
Inquiry, It -was said to-day, will be the
Investigation of all percentages re
ceived by insurance officers in addi
tion to the salaries and fees. It is said
that it has been the of high
officials in several big companies to re-"
ceive such percentages and commis
sions. In regard to the rumor that J.
P. Morgan may be called on to testify,
Assemblyman Ezra P. Prentiss, the
secretary of the committee, said to-day:
The -. committee will have no : hesitation In
calling -on Mr. Morgan or any other man to
testify If it believes that ms. testimony Is es
sential to the Inquiry or if It believes he 4s
the beet one to furnish the Information.- Up to
date I see no reason why Mr. Morgan should be
called.
Asked as to. the report that Cornelius
Bliss may be asked to produce a list of
all contributions received 'by the Re
publican National' Committee last year,
TrentlEs'said: . . -\'~
I believe that arty contributions *o made will
be furnished by \u25a0 the Insurance companies and
that there will be no ne*2 to call on the treas

"If Sweden Is. to be able in the future

TOGO NOT â¢ A CHRISTIAN.
Japanese Educatoi" ; Corrects a Belief
Concerning .the Admiral. .
NEW YORK. S.ept. 17.-â What effect
the war In the Far.JEast willhave upon
the propagation or a Christian religion
in Japan was the subject of a lecture
at the 'West f Branch -Young Men's
Christian Association by Dr. Ibuka,
president of an institution of learning
In' Tofclo and himself : a'Christlan:" 1 .:
That the recent â¢ outbreak in , Tokio
and the attack upon the churches was
â¢the result of merely a local feeling and.
dia ' not- represent "any -widespread anti
foreign or anti-Christian sentiment.in
\u25a0the empire was the assertion of the
-lecturer. Said he: .:
â¢.-. ."When - : the . war * with' Russia flrtt * began I
and " my fellow Christians in Japan were \u25a0 un
easy for fear that the struggle should result in
a- lasting animosity, toward -the Christian re
ligion in the empire. At first "the 'cry.w as
raised that it was a struggle of Buddhism
versus Christianity, and the Russians did many
things to foster this sentiment, but it was not
long until this illusion was dispelled and tbe
people were brought : to :see .that religion and
religious beliefs had no partin the war.
--â¢Already; China "- has . become ' aroused to the
fact that she has much to learn, . and she Is
seeking this knowledge from Japan rather than
from - European ' countries. - Hundred*; of -the
young 'men of- Japan are taking positions as in
structors : in -the Chinese .institutions of learn
ing and? hundreds: of .the' young men of China
are coming to the^ colleges of Japan for ' in
struction.-. It "is vitally \u25a0 neceSsiry that the
young- men- should be taught the truths of
Christian -religion , If it. Is to bo spread in
China. '&&&!o&s&si&SsB&siSssÂ£M
\u25a0Dr.- Ibuka.;- said that â¢ the reports
â¢which had been published that Admiral

Tired
Nervous
iWhea you feel languid, tired,
nervous and irritable, your vi-
tality is low â your supply of
nerve energy exhausted, and
your system running down foe
lack of power,
The organs of the body are
working poorly, or not at^all,
and you are not getting the
nourishment needed. This soon
impoverishes the blood and in-
stead of throwing off the im-
purities, distributes it all
through the body. .This brings
disease and misery.
Feed the nerves with Dr.
Miles' Nervine, a nerve food, a
nerve medicine, that nourishes
and strengthens the nerves, and
see how quickly you will get
strong and vigorous.
"My wife suffered -with nervousness
previous to a recent attack ofjtyphoid
fever, but after her recovery from the
fever, she was much worse, and could
hardly control herself beint; exceed-
ingly nervous when the least excited.
Bhe .was very restless at night, and
never had a rood night's rest. Bhe
: also suffered much from nervous head-
ache. Dr. Allies' Nervine was recom-
mended by a friend. After the first
three doses she had a good night's
rest, and at the end of the first week's
treatment she w&a wonderfully im-
proved. Continued use of Nervine has
completed her entire cure." * - . '

I GROUP OF SCHOOLGIRLS WHO
HAVE JOINED MOVEMKN'T TO
DISCARD HEADGEAR.
i One of the novel sights of the city these
; days in the appearance of children on their
j way to and from school minus their hats.
I The style has been inaugurated In the
I Western .Addition and. is rapidly spread
! ing throughout the city. Parents have
! taken kindly to the idea, as, they do not
| have to buy hats for Katy, Mary and
Grade, and because there is less danger
of the spread of scalp diseases.
The girls like the new style, as it gives
them the. opportunity of displaying their
tresses and fancy ribbons. The style in
hair-combing . ranges from the "Buster
Brown" hair cut to the long braid. The
new fad originated In the Henry Durand
School, on Turk street, near Buchanan.
The pioneers of the hatless fashion are
pleased with its spread, and not even the
strict orders of a Board' of Education
could induce them to don headgear.
Health Officer D. ' F. Ragan is an advo
cate of the prevailing style and recom
mends It to all. In discussing the matter
[ yesterday the doctor said:
I "The nutrition of the hair depends upon
I the circulation of the blood in the fine
i capillaries of the scalp. The pressure of a
hat encircling the head cuts off a certain
amount of circulation, which interferes
with the nutrition of the hair. I strongly
advocate allowing the girls, to attend
school without headgear. x'here is no
danger of a child taking cold, as the
\u25a0 hardening of tbe scalp and skin will pre
vent it. By hardening of the scalp I
mean its adaptability is increased by this
natural exposure. By going without hats
the girls are less liable to catarrhal trou
bles, sore throat, coryza and the- other
numerous ailments the child is exposed to.
"In New sYork a careful compiling ol
reports by the medical school inspectors,
numbering 100, showed that the ordinary
scalp diseases common to child life were
traceable, to the putting of .hate, in -close
proximity, and that -where precautions
were made to separate the hats the num
ber of cases of scalp contagion was re
duced. . ,V..vl
"I am/strongly in favor of. sending the
girls to school without hats. Let the. hair
be strengthened by the air, and sunlight.
I would also advise 'mothers and fathers
to give the children the benefit of sea
air as much as possible. Take advantage
of the ocean close by and give the chilr
drcn the benefit of healthy breezes that
come from it."

GIRL TO SAIL

Denver Man Will Be Accom

When Testing Invention
SEW FLYING MACHINE
Its Builder Is Confident
That the Aerial Craft
Will Answer Its Budder
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CzXL
DENVER. Sept. 17.â 1f the Invention of
J. M. Oneal of 555 Downing avenue proves
the success be expects, he will hays .tha
first practical airship ever constructed.
He will test It next Sunday and one of his
daughters will accompany him.
; The airship is simple In construction.
A cigar-shaped bag, inflated with hydro
gen gas. raises the machine. Mr. Oneal
says he will bfe able to steer it in any di
rection by the aid of bis rudder, which
consists of two intersecting planes sÂ«t at
right angles at the forward end of tha
ship. By lowering or raising the steer
ing apparatus, Oneal claims, he will be
able to send bis machine up or down.
Power is supplied by a gasoline motor
which, with a belt, operates a little wheel
at the rear end of a cylinder fifteen feet
long and twenty-four inches in diameter.
Its action is intended to create. a suction
through the cylinder, tending to force thÂ«
ship forward and to act against tha air
in the machine's wake as a. further pro
pelling power.
An improved \u25a0 motor invented by OneaX
will be used on the airship. â¢ Surrounding
the. axle, cylinder and pistons thera is a,
heavy fly wheel, bearing on its Inner sur-
I face several curved flanges. The exhaust
is double and arranged to strike each
of these flanges. Considerable Impetus
is given the wheel in this way.
\u25a0m The air bag will be filled from a devic*
also Invented by Oneal. It consists of a
tall iron pipe into which iron filings will
be placed. Hot water will be passed over
the filings,, the reaction creating hydro
gen gas. . Oneal claims that this method
will prove even more effective than that
generally in use of mixing Iron filings
and sulphuric add in a vat.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
DAUTH'S TALE
UNDER INQUIRY
Police Investigating Story
That Wife Tried to Kill
Him and Took Own Life
AUTOPSY IS ORDERED
Examination of the Wounds
and Evidence Tend to
Prove Husband's Version
OAKLAND. Sept. 17.â The police are
virtually con\-lnced that Mr*. Arthur K.
Dauth did Ehoot her husband in an at
tempt to kill him before ene slashed her
own throat, as he has related. It has
been learned that she had ihreatened. in
conversations wUn acquaintances about
her domestic affairs, to take his life.
However, the case is still under Investi
gation and Dauth wiU be held at the Re
ceUing Hospital, where he wcirt to have
his wound dressed, until the Inquest,
which will be begun to-morrow night, is
concluded.
Chief of Police Hodgkin? has not been
altogether satisfied with Dauth's state
ments regarding the tragedy yesterday
morning at the Colonial. 9H Castro street,
and has ordered that the husband be not
allowed to talk with any one.
The main point at isÂ«ue Involved the
deep wounds in the woman's ' throat,
which Dauth .declares were self-inflicted
after she had shot him and had. slashed
him in the neck and about the hands
while struggling with her.
Dr. O. D. Harnlln, assisted by Dr. J. M.
Kane, Dr. J. S. Green and Dr. C. E.
Ourdts. held an autopsy to-night on Mre.
Dauth's body. Two distinct cuts were
found in the neck, so deep that ail of the'
arteries' were severed. Dr. Hamlin would
r.ot express an opinion as to whether the
wounds were self inflicted. He said:
"There is nothing revealed by the au
tppsy which would Indicate of itself
whether the cuts were suicidal or homi
cidal. A minute record was made of the
nature of the" wounds, their measure
ments, direction and all of the detail con
nected with the autopsy. This knowledge
may be of use In case the police should
find any collateral evidence which would
be of value in determining the truth or
the falsity of the statements Dauth has
made. But so far as the medical phase
piesents itself to-night the case could
have been one of suicide or of homicide."
That Mrs. Dauth was jealous of her
husband and had frequently upbraided
him for his alleged freedom with other
women Is the testimony of Mrs. Laura
H. Ogden. a shopkeeper " at 654 Seventh
etreet, with whom Mrs. Dauth had fre
quently talked concerning her husband.
Mrs. Ogden told the police that Mrs.
Dauth had said Dauth was running
around with other women, and she
eeemed to be very much" wrought U P
about her husband's conduct. According
to Mrs. Ogden, the Dautbs had not p been
happy together- and there- had-'-been- fre
quent quarrels over the subject of
Dauth's escapades. \u25a0
Mrs. Dauth was ambitious to "earn
money. She was not satisfled to allow her
husband to provide alone for their needs
and enjoyments. She had worked at times
since their marriage at a cannery in West
Oakland and at the Contra Costa laundry.
WANT A GRE.ITER RICHMOND.
OAKLAND, Sept. 17. â One large city
of Richmond will probably be the out
come of a campaign recently Inaugu
rated for the incorporation of the en
tire school district under the municipal
government of the present town. When
the present municipality was incor
porated several months ago only half
of the town of Point Richmond was
Included in the corporate limits and
Bince that time there have been a num
ber of proposals to Incorporate the
eastern portion of the town, which
was left out on the previous occasion,
under a separate government.
Several names were suggested for the
proposed new town and finally the
name of Rockefeller was selected, but
this was not entirely satisfactory and
later the name of East Richmond was
suggested.
Richmond as it is now incorporated
is a city of the sixth class. By rein
corporation it would be enlarged to a
city of the- fifth class and the Santa
Fe shops and Standard Oil Works
â¢would be included in the limits of the
new city. This would add several mil
lion dollars' worth v. property to the
assessment roll, making the taxes
much lighter than at present.
CHIXESE MERCHANT WOUXDED.
OAKLAND, Sept. 17. â Kan Hung, a

He ran through Eighth street, across
Webster, and there was captured by J.
Bell, an elderly housepainter, residing

LEARNS HOW TO CHECK
PEAR TREE SCOURGE.
REMEDY FOR THE BLIGHT
Professor R. Smith
Makes a Great
Discovery.
BERKELEY. Sept. 17.â Professor Ralph
E. Smith, the university plant expert, has
received words of highest commendation
from Professor M. B. Waite, the Govern
ment authority on plant diseases, who
has Just left for Washington. D. C, after
several weeks spent in investigating the
work done here to stamp out pear blight.
Professor Waite is regarfled as perhaps
the greatest authority on diseases of this
character. He was called to this State
a year ago, when the pear blight first
made its appearance, and then gave direc
tions, after conferring with Professor
Smith of the University ;Â«f California, for
a> campaign against the blight. Â«
This campaign has been waged under
the supervision of Professor Smith
throughout the year, and Professor Walte
now expresses himself as delighted with
the progress made. He believes the pear
blight, originally a menace to tho in
dustry, is now under such control that
its effect need not be greatly feared,
while the prospect is excellent for its
complete eradication.
Professor Waite'a word In this matter Is
regarded as authority, as he has made
a special etudy of the pear blight. He
it responsible for the change in the be
lief that the winds carry the seeds of
the disease from tree to tree. Professor
Walte has demonstrated that insects
carry the disease, and that the winds
have nothing to do with It. The germ
that does ; the damage in pear blight is
of a gummy consistency oJid not of a
sort to be carried about bj* the wind.
Many errors were made In attempting
to combat the disease, because the in
sects' part in its propagation and trans
mission was overlooked, until Professor
Waite demonstrated that Insects do the
business. He showed, his friends say.
that Insects were at the 1 bottom of he
trouble, by covering pear treas with net
ting to keep out the Insects. The. trees
were then exposed to the germs. The
wind blew, but the trees were not afr
fected, while other trees not protected
with netting soon showed evidences of
the blight. This discovery practically
revolutionized the method of treating, the
disease, and helped to make the method
practiced now almost entirely successful.
BERKELEY, Sept. 17.â Professor -C.
W. Wood worth and his fellow-ento
mologists at the State" University are
awaiting with Intense Interest the out
come of a -trip to China, which George
Compere, famous for his work in the
Interests of the horticultural industry
of California, has undertaken. Com
pere has written to his fellow-workers
at the university from West Australia
that he expects to secure in China a
parasite for the purple scale, a pest
that has afflicted the orange groves In
Southern/ California for -many years* ,-,
Compere Is an indefatigable and
quite successful collector of Insects
that prey on fruit pests. If he finds
the parasite he seeks In China the val
uable little insects will be sent to this
State at once. His efforts -In other
fields have proved so productive of val
uable results- that. the present quest he
is conducting in China is confidently
expected to be the beginning of the
end of the 'purple scale's devastating
work in California,
Compere went to West Australia re
cently after a trip to Brazil, under
taken to find a parasite for a certain
sort of fruit fly which has worked
havoc In the citrus fruit Industry of
Australia. â¢ His codling: moth parasite
brought to California last, winter is re
ported to have-done excellent work in
many orchards where the codling moth
held' sway. Experienced orchardiÃts
say, however, - that It will take prob
ably another year for the parasites to
multiply in sufficient numbers to drive
the moth from the orchards entirely.

said: . . . .
The main consideration of th* Iroquols Club

lng men for : public office we â¢ should select
honest men, rather than party, men. A man's

William; H. Kline, a past president 'of

"We ought to stand for. clean politics
above party, and we should work for

DROWNED OFF THE BAR.
CHARLES JENSEN FALLS OVERBOARD INTO THE SEA
When About to Go
Under Last Time
He Is Rescued.
Seaman Charles Jensen of the pilot !
boat Lady Mine had a narrow escape
from being drowned just outside the
Golden Gate Saturday afternoon. He ;
xvas attempting to get into a yawl to
gro alongside the French bark Noemi
to take off Pilot James Miller, who had
navigated the Noemi out to sea. when
the accident occurred. But for the
prompt action of Seaman Chris John
son, one of the crew of the Lady Mine,
Jensen would have gone to the bottom of
the briny deep.
The Noemi was just outside the heads
when Pilot Miller signaled the Lady
Mine to send the yawl alongside to
take him off. Jensen hauled the yawl
alongside the Lady Mine, and tried to
hjuxnp aboard. He missed his footing
and fell into the ocean. A nasty, chop
py tea was running at the time, and a
strong northwest wind was blowing.
No sooner had Jensen struck the water
than he began drifting underneath the
pilot boat. "When he appeared again
on the surface be began drifting across
the bows of the Noemi. The bark
threw out life lines and life preservers,
but Jensen failed to catch any of them.
It was plain to all those on both the
bark and the pilot boat that in a mo
ment Jensen would be gone. Sailor
Chris Johnson came to the rescue. He
jumped into the yawl of the pilot boat
and pulled with a strong stroke to
where the drowning sailor was strug
gling for life. He reached Jensen just
as the latter was sinking the third
time.
Johnson caught a hold on the ex
hausted sailor and aucceeded In landing
him on the deck of the pilot boat.
Jensen was completely exhausted,
end it took an hour's hard work to
bring him to.
Pilot Miller was later taken off the
NofemU and then Captain Schaeffer
\u25a0teered the bark toward the north for
Port Townsend, to which place she is
bound.

LOS ANGELES, Sept.- 17.â 1t is possible
that within the next: sixty days the con
trol of ; the State Bank and iTruit'TCom
pany.one of the oldest established banks
of this city, will pass into; the' hands- of
San Francisco capitalists/. While admit
ting the ti uth ,of this,. . President H. J.
Woollacott refuses to divulge their names.
The last sale' of State Bank, and Trust
Company stock was! made at 102. The San
Francisco "capitalists fare Voffering: 115 a
share for a controlling interest. Jf the
negotiation 'succeeds it will ;, mean a new
set of officers : for the institution.": \u25a0\u25a0, \u25a0>-*> ;
\u25a0It has transpired that Â» for three "years
the bank has been lending largs; sums of
money to its cashier, Major J.W. A. 'Off,
in; violation of the State- law forbidding
the 7 making of ; loans by such \ institutions
to \u25a0 their 'officers. -When; the fact .was^dis
covered by Bank .Examiner,. Eldrldge. he
directed that all of the Off loans be called
In. At . the time Major Off was Indebted
to the'bank in the sum of $75,000.
"Major Off," said President Woollacott,"
Vhas paid back all of his indebtedness to
the bank except $35,000, which he j will re
pay within the next sixty days. I ;want
it understood, however, that Major , Off
never borrowed from the bank without
the sanction of the. finance,'; committee
and the subsequent approval of the board
of directors. To secure the bank he has
put. up as collateral $50,000 of Huuntlngton
Beach stock. Priorly he had transferred
for the protection of the bank his $30,000
home on South Flgueroa street; title to
which has now been restored to him. It
is not true that Cashier Off's wife has
pledged her private fortune for the banks
protection, though she would have \ done
so if it had been required. "The State
Bank and Trust Company is in excellent
shape." R. Howell.-vlce president of the
institution, said: "Major Off has "not
been guilty of any wrongdoing. He bor
rowed in the regular way. I do not know
the . character of hlsMosses, except that
certain oil and land investments of his
did not turn out well. The bank is amply
protected."

BITTER EXPERIENCE
Ex-Senators Shake Hands
and Unlucky, One Tells the
Other About Prison Life
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 17.â The monot
ony of Harry Bunkers', prison life
was \ broken Friday evening when Ell
vv right, surrendered bjr his bondsmen,
entered the jail and was bolted in. -A
smile played over Bunkers' emaciated
features, and then he broke' into
laughter as he watched the former
statesman from San Jose inspect the
cell that was to be his residence, for
the night at least. Though Wright Is
now out, of jail, it will be some time
before he erases from his memory the
experience of that night and his ears
grow deaf to the recollection of the
ringing laugh- with which Bunkers
greeted his discomfiture.-
When Wright entered the prison'
Bunkers was seated in the. corridor.
For several -minutes Wright did. not
look at the man that had turned State's
evidence against him. but finally he
walked up^o Bunkers, held out his hand
and said: : "Well, Harry, how are you?"
Bunkeis. shook hands with Wright, and
then Wright said; "My God, this is aw
ful. /My bondsmen have .surrendered
me into. custody. I have tried every
where, to find some one that would sign
my bond, but I have failed."
"Don't like It, do you?" said Bunkers.
"For four months I have been in this
jail, and none â¢of â¢ you came near me.
It will 'do you good to remain inside a
while, and then you can appreciate the
extent of the wrong you have done me
by refusing to aid me or my family."
With this statement Bunkers turned
and walked away. Wright had nothing
to say to Bunkers regarding his con
fession."-, He appeared to be friendliness
itself,- and if he resents the stand that
Bunkers. has taken in the case he kept
his counsel well. .
Bunkers, pale and emaciated, sat for
a photograph to-day. A comparison of
his latest' Dicture with those taken
when lie was. in the ; Senate strikingly
demonstrates the extent of his suffer
ing since the hand of the law fell upon
him. # He 'has. lost seventy pounds since
the day -of his arrest, and if there is
a drop of , red blood left in his body it
is not in evidence. Even his lips are
white and his ;face is the color of the
lime-washed cell. that is his home.
Hope has grown within him, how
ever, that he will soon be free. "And
when r am free," he said. to-day, "there
will be those -that â¢ will regret their
treatment of me. ! My confession con
tains nothing that- has not been testi
fied to >in the Emmons -trial, but my
memory does and I shall'use my knowl

EXPANDING AGAIN.
THERE was less monotony and more snap to trade last 'week.
Strange as it may appear, the current signs indicate a still fur
ther expansion of business.
It has been the opinion that the limit of expansion had been
reached, at least for the present epoch of prosperity, but the com
mercial reports now coming in indicate otherwise. First, there is
the exhibit of the iron and steel industry, that most excellent barom
eter to trade. Advices from Pittsburg report an unprecendented
demand for steel rails, chiefly from the West, the orders already
booked for 1906 amounting to 1,500,000 tons, while fully 300,000
tons contracted for delivery thisryear will â¢have to go over into 1906.
Almost all descriptions of finished material exhibit gratifying ac
tivity, while the pig iron market continues active.
Another expansion is in 'the bank note circulation.
The Financial Chronicle refers to one^ source of the recent ad
vance in stock market values â namely, the increase in the country's
bank note circulation in the last five or six years. The volume of
outstanding circulation, based on bonds, has more than doubled, the |
addition reaching over $255,000,000. In this same period the gold
holdings of the Government have increased fully as much as the
national bank notes, and of the $2,901,791,907 composing the general
stock of money in the country, coined or issued, on August 1, $1,368,
427,343, or not far 'from half of the total amount, is in gold coin or
gold certificates. Whatever inflation there has been going on thus
far has therefore been a gold inflation rather than a paper one.
Still another expansion is that of the current increase in divi
dends. During the past several weeks a number of vast Eastern
corporations have increased their dividends, some of them now pay
ing up to 7 and 8 per cent, even on the high market "quotations for
the stock. This confirms the statements of bankers, so frequent
during the past year, that stocks, from a dividend point of view
were not too high, though it was supposed that they were high
enough for fair and safe dividends. But this would indicate # that the
bankers have been agreeably surprised by the further expansion in
this direction. Casting aside ail speculative considerations, stocks
are not too high when they can honestly pay 7 and 8 per cent to the
stockholders. Then it must also be considered that some great
groups of capital are paying away over even these returns.
From th;s point of view financiers argue that there is not much
danger of any serious decline in the national stock market, unless
the unexpected happens, which is v always a contingency to be borne
in mind.
Still there hzs been a decline in stocks during the past few days.
Higher money has had a good deal to do with this. On Friday
money on call went up to 4 per cent, the rise in the rate being at
tributed to the Standard Oil dividends, amounting to $6,000,000, and
the Consolidated dividend of $1,600,000. The money went up in
consequence of the demand to pay these dividends, loans were called
in and stock was thrcrsm on the market to meet the loan require
ments, hence the decline.
Another cause of the advance in money was the demands upon
the New York banks to meet the Western calls for moving the
crops. Then there is the anticipatory consideration. It is said that
a large Russian loan is MvAtr contemplation, and if it is offered at
this time, when the New York banks are sending away into the in
terior about $i/xajxo every day, advances in money and declines
in stocks iray be expected. Eut against this large amounts of gold
held in European centers have been released by the conclusion of
peace between Rcssia and Japan, and this will be available, both for
the Rcssiaa kaa and for export to the United States, should the lat
ter need h. It is evidently expected that we will need it, for the talk
in Xevr York is that anywhere from $25,000,000 to $50,000,000 in
gold uili he sent to this country during the coming fall. In hypoth
ecation c*f this the Banks of England, France and Germany have
lately raised their rates of discount, and these acts have tended to
render the money markets of both Europe and America unsettled
and nervous, with a harder tendency in money all over the world.
Turning from money to merchandise, we see the same activity,
with less monotony. The cotton market has lately been sensitive
with increased speculative activity on the different exchanges, the
condition of (the crop being the dominating factor. , Speculation in
wheat and corn has also been brisk. The wholesalers and jobbers
of the West report; the fall distribution of merchandise of unprece
dented volume. Building operations are reported as active as at
any time this year, and the lumber trade is said to be in most ex
cellent condition in most sections. The railroads are handling vast
quantities of goods, and their earnings thus far in September exceed
those of the same time last year by 3.7 per cent. The exports of
staple products from the United States in August were $16,833,900,
or over 50 per cent larger than during August, 1904. The only
staple showing weakness at the moment is copper, which has.de
clined in price, with a visible falling off in both the domestic and ex
port demand. The failures last week were 194, against 244 last year,
and the bank clearings showed a gain over 1904 of 17.9 per cent,
.with only seven of the first sixty cities on the list showing losses.
Thus, wherever we lookâ toward money, the circulation, mer
chandise, railroad earnings, bank clearings, failures, crop prospects
â we find an increasing buoyancy and expansion and a growing ten
dency to branch out in a further extension of general trade. What
this renewed expansion means â what its cause is, how long it will
continue,- how far it will go and whether it is temporary or perma
nent, detrimental or beneficial, will develop later on. Let us how
ever be content with the present brilliant conditions. Sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof.
EXHAUSTLESS CALIFORNIA GOLD.
GOLD dredging in California is the subject of bulletin No. 36
by Lewis E. Aubury, State Mineralogist, and recently issued
by the California State Mining Bureau. Its indication of the
enormous, still undeveloped gold resources of California is a pleas
ing revelation. The millions of wealth that He waiting to be skill
fully dug for will be an . incentive to the enterprise and hope of
capitalists, to laborers in "mining industry, and to all who have a
stake in the assurance of a- 'continuance of general prosperity.
Aubury states that the issuance of this bulletin has been- long
in contemplation, but there has been such difficulty in obtaining ac
curate data that the publication was postponed until the present
time. The pamphlet is largely taken up with the descriptions of
dredging machinery and accounts of its operation; but there are
other pages of wider interest. In the matter of the dredging out
fits it is stated that many failures haye N resulted, from neglect'. to
thoroughly study the ground before having the machinery, manu
factured. Each piece of ground is its own problem, and requires
a dredger specially adapted to it. An account of dredging 1 in the
Oroville district, where was made the second gold discovery in
California, shows how great in gold romance that region still is.
The twenty-eight dredgers that are operating there cost over
$1,500,000, and they arc dredging up more than $1,000,000 worth of
gold per year. There arc 7500 acres of \ dredge- worth gravel iten
yards deep in that district. The minimum estimate of the gold fhÂ«it
can be profitably dredged from it is $60,000,000.
The total area of dredge gravel in California now under con
sideration for exploiting is 25,000 acres. It is thought by dredge
sxithorities that when working costs of dredge operations are re
duced 25,000 acres will be added to the area that it is already de
cided to dredge the Sacramento Valley. The 25,000 acres which
have been proved and decided upon to work are estimated to yield
$163,350,000. \u25a0â¢'..-.. . ' ' 'â¢'

WOMAN HOLDS UNIQUE POSITION
IN THE SEEVICE OF UNCLE SAM
IN all the, thousand* of women in
the United States Government's em
ploy there are rery few who have
become conspicuous by reason of cheir
technical training and scientific' knowl
edge.
; Mtes L. Eernie Gallahex, the assistant
photographer In the national raosecm at
Washington. . Is the only woman in that
branch of the Government's service and
her work has twwn slagalariy successful,
says the Chicago Chronicle. She has
been a most valuable aid to that veteran
In photography. Professor Tboi323 W.
Smlllie, vrho tor thirty-five years has
b*en the photographer of the museum
and rho has photographed icqre eclipses,
probably, than any other man in the
country-
Miss GaJlaher" Is a native of Wash
ington and has b<een connected with the
: muÂ«*--;rr. for the past twenty-seven years.
She bÂ«?an as a clerk, and about fifteen
years ago took up amateur photography
as a fz.d. Returning from cne of her
vacations she exhibited some of the pic
tures sfce had made. They carr.e /tender
the observation of Profesaor-Smlllie. lie
saw at once the merit in them and, the
possibilities cf the artist under proper
training. It vr&s bat a short time after
that Miss GaHaher was transferred to the
photographic department, where she â¢ Is
now doing- work that has attracted the
attention of artists as well aÂ« scientists
throughout the conntr}'-
Mlcroacopic photography la one of the
branches in which Mis 3 Gallaher has
done some eplendid work. This labor Is
cnnaually trying both on the . eyes and
the endurance' of the artist. A specimen
of this ciaf of work for nse In ilhistrat
', Ing one of the papers that will appear
in this year's Smithsonian report has
I just been completed. It consists of a
\u25a0 number of seazhells so Infinitesimal that
; their shajie Is almost Indefinable to the
! naked eye. By osmÂ» of the microscopic
j lens thÂ«< bits of matter are enlarged
enormously and every detail of their
structure brought out clearly and dis
tinctly. This wcrk Is done tinder a very
powerful electric light and Is necessarily
extremely taxing to the eye*.
In the oQcial gallery fa, ?re are 16,000
negatives, every one a picture of great
value. ProfeMor Smlllie and his assist
ants do all the work for the museum
and the Smithsonian, and the excellent
Illustrations that accompany the annual
reports of these Institutions are their
work.
Curlosltles In the museum, fabrics, hu
man bo&es, gems, mummies, tapestries,
ancient coins, etc., form the "subjects"
for these official photographers.
When a curator writes a paper he In
structs the photographic department
what sort of Illustrations he wishes, and
It falls to the lot of Miss Gallaher to
prepare the negative, make the prints
and get the pictures ready for the en
graver.
One exhibit that shows the wide variety
of subjects Is a photograph of a flea
many times magnified and of a mastodon,
recently restored In the museum.
Another of Mies Gallaher's specialties
Is the making of lantern slides. She has
some magnificent specimens of this class
of photography that have been used on
the lecture platform In this country and
THE CHINAMAN AND THE BRANDY.
"Them Chinks," said the reformed bar
tender to a New York Herald man,
a tricky lot- "lt's hard' to fktfep up with
'em. No sooner do you 'think you've
learnt all their dodges than, biff! they
spring a new one on you.
\u25a0^"Wnen I was tending bar out West a
Chink come In one day and took a bottle
out of his wide sleeve. -'
"'Gimme,' he says, 'blandy. Half a
dolla. 1
" 'Half a dollar's worth o* brandy? Is
that what you mean, John?"
" 'Yes, yeÂ«, yes.'
"So I filled his bottle for him and he
put it up his sleeve again and felt in his
pocket for the money. All of a sudden
he frowned."- , \u25a0â¢;

The Government appropriated J4OGO for
the expenses connected with ' photograph
ing the recent eclipse at Wadesbcro.? N.
C... Professor Smlllie took the *. pictures
and "eclipsed" the protographers of the
observatories the world over. This tÂ«00
was expended for a "sitting that occu
pied exactly r.iniity seconds. In that tbaÂ«
Prof esaor Smlllie took eight negatives
through his powerful I telescopic lenses,
each ; negative almost three "feet in di
ameter. - The "' pictures . from these nega
tives were made by Miss Gallaher and
they have been - pronounced -to be the
finest specimens of photographic printing
In existence.
In the printing and manipulation of
platinum paper Miss Gallaher Is an ex- ;
pert- This paper. Is used in pictures
where It Is desired to; bring out the
lights and shadows In contrast, and some
of the results she has obtained on very
large prints are so remarkable that they
appear to be steel engravings rather than
photographs.
Miss Gallaher Is also a fine adminis
trative! officer. "When her chief is away,
as be frequently is. . she Is in charge of
ths photographic force, which is not in
considerable. . .
Seven rooms , in the musÂ«um building
are devoted to this work. Upon the suc
cessful accomplishment of the tasks as
signed to this jj department depend the
superiority of many oorf r the documents

by the experts. â¢_

It Is only when yon have love ia

the eye ot the mind instead of the eyÂ»
Of the heart
Only ha that loves will find it. His
eyes will be clear to behold it; his ears
trill be attsned to its music; nts lips
win be eloquent in its praise. He will
go through the forest of circox&stasc*
like a singing bird through the wood,
finding love's melody everywhere, la
every hoar of daylight. In ' the f rÂ«sh>
sweet breath of morning, in ris quiet
air of evening, falling to earth stam

What was it that Solomon, the wise.
asserted: No man can find out ths>

the same token, ha who loves not will
never find love, though ha searea un
ceasingly forever. Tpr lot â¢ la. itself
love's lodestone. and there Is no other.
' There are many degrees of purity la

perfect love, the love without alloy, is
rare as a vein of pure gold Is ta the
rock.
Mother lov* is not upon a lower plis â¢
than that of sweethearts, because ft
gives all, asking nothing except aa op
portunity of giving more. Love, as it
exists between man and maid, xnsst b Â»
reciprocal, and also must have lta
earthly as well as its spiritual aids.
For bo the law of nature has or
dained it.
Tet this Is only one of lova's xaaai
festations: It Is but part of thÂ« per
fect whole. The highest fora of hu
man lova Is that which is complete to
giving.
Remember this: Tou cannot measure
love~by what you gain by It. but only
;by what. you give. If yon bay* it not,
you will never find it. Nor can you
sell your soul for the price of it. for
thus you would only bo selling thÂ«
thing you were trying to bay.
. But remember this also: There is love,
all about -us. In the air we breathe, ia
the beauty that nourishes our spirits.
In the pain which teaches us bow Ctejt
our roots are la - that common soil
whence springs humanity. There is love

CITY OWNERSHIP
DEVELOPS FLAW
Authorities of Sheffield Face
a Serious Problem as the
..Result .of Mismanagement
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDIN0Â»
WASHINGTON. Sept. 17.^AmerIcans, ! on
the" eye of municipal' campaigns In which
municipal ownership may be an engross
ing issue, will be interested in. a report
from Consul Daniels Hit Sheffield on some
of the drawbacks and dangers of public
ownership of utilities serving the public.
He says: -^; 'Â«-^;Vr/.'
The city of Sheffield, in the management of
its electric tramway system, finds itself con
fronted with a condition that some of thÂ« more
far-seeing members \u25a0 of the City Council
(notably Sir Joseph Jonas, the Lord Mayor)
have insisted would result. This condition is
due, despite the tact that the system has been
operated at an apparent profit while furnish
ing cheaper transportation than any system
In the United Kingdom, to a failure to prop
erly charge oft a reasonable \u25a0 amount yearly
for the depreciation of the plant. This fail
ure brings the city face to face with the ne
cessity of adjusting - and raising fares or op
erating 1 the eystenv at a loss, possibly, or at
any rate at no profit. > ' .- \u25a0
The report of the Tramways Committee for
last year shows the following- condition: The
mileage run was. In 1901, 2,315,347 miles;
1902, 3,781,993; 1903. 4,926,083'; 1004. 6,768,231;
1605 (estimated), 6,049,899. -The passengers
carried rose from 61,450,893 to 63,952,283 and
the revenue from all sources from' $1,130, 738
to $1,170,713, an Increase of 2,501,290 In num
bers and $39,975 In, revenue. := .*
In 1901 each car earned on an average 27
cents per car , mile, and \u25a0 the average fare per
passenger was 1.8 cents. The figures for the
following years were: 1902, 23% cents and 1.8
cents per passenger; 1903, 20% cents and 1.8
cents: 1904, 19 cents and 1.8 cents; 1003. . 19
cents and 1.8 cents. If the fares per pas&en
gen In 1905 had been the same aa In 1901, 1 tha
revenue would have increased by $37,472. The
average fare per passenger in Manchester wai
2.38 cents; Bradford 2.26 cents, and Liverpool
2.22 cents. ' : \- : \u25a0 .
The corporation Is constantly beseiged with
applications for extensions of the tramway
service to outlyins districts. Thia is felt to
be the policy that ought to be adhered to. but
It is apparent to all that -no free extensions
of the service can be made without providing
In some way for Increased revenue. It is also
conceded now that the past policy of tramway
management has been wrong, In that there
kas been an Insufficient allowance for depre
ciation and renewals. This is the situation at
present and the only remedy seems to be to
raise the rate of fares.

If Judge Gaynor declines to . accept

leaders who asked him to become their

were under ; the Impression that' Judge
Gaynor was considering the offer? and
that he would give his answer to-mor

had already given his answer and ; that
he had' nothing; to add to it. although
he declined to reveal its nature. ; :

Duringthe night a surprise in the shape
of a deer, hunt was .prepared' by Alfred

On the return .to the Sbarboro Villa
with their game, al sumptuous banquet
awaited the guests. It was under a long

the chase made doubly enjoyable the vi
ands and wines which were in waiting.
After dinner the members of the party
enjoyed themselves with i numerous visi

LEAVES DINNER
TO END LIFE
Mf^KM^lSScott, Daughter
of Wealthy Australian,
Drinks Carbolic Acid
DIES AT THE HOSPITAL
Quarrel With Her Husband
While at Friend's Home
Cause of the Eash Deed
Mrs.' Myrtle Scott, -wife of Oily M. Scott,
a musician, and daughter of Joseph
Marks, a â¢wealthy wholesale merchant of
Sydney, Australia, committed [suicide last
night . by swallowing carbolic acid at the
home of r a friend at 328 Ellis street.
The rash act waa preceded by a slight
altercation ;, between i ; ; husband ,. and .'wife.
Before Scott could define her purpose and
stop her she had taken the fatal draug-ht.
i- The unfortunate woman was hurried! to
the Central Emergency Hospital, where
Dr. W." E." Stevens did all in \u25a0 his power to
save her. / She" died in a' half , hour, with
out - having : regained consciousness.
\u25a0 Mrs. ," Scott ' arrived '. from ' Sydney three
months ago. Her husband preceded her
two "j weeks, '; going to .Vancouver, \u25a0 B. C.
Two weeks ago he came to this city. He
met ";. his .wife - unexpectedly.* not knowing
she. had " left \ Australia. The two- lived
at 225 O'Farrell : street. "
; On Saturday . Mrs. ' Scott . signified heir
intention of â¢ going to room with Mrs.
Helen 'Willis, at * 328 I Ellis ; street { Scott
says. he raised' no objection, : as she .was
set in her ways, " and to avoid ' a quarrel
he allowed her to go. \u25a0â¢ V- Â«
, Last night Scott -- called at the "Willis
house to take supper, with his wife. Some
difficulty between ' the couple arose. Scott
asserts : the difference Â» was of small con
seQuence.".' Harsh ..words .were , passed and
Mrs. I Scott got *; up from the table and
walked' : to the" bureau. -Before her pur
pose j could be - anticipated she had drunk
two : ounces ; of } the poison, i,
Scott : was unnerved at his wife's death
and collapsed at'her deatu bed. He had
to be led from the hospital wardJ;
,v They ,,. were married four'years ago in
Sydney.- 'Mrs.; -Scott's ? parents objected
strongly, to the^ match.. The^daughter was
disowned by the family and after her hus
band called . for America she said ' she
could ; not < bear to I stay alone .in \u25a0_ Sydney.
Because a cablegram * was misdirected,
Scott was unaware that his wife had left
home. : He came In search of employment
and was to | have sent for her." ' . .
A TRULYJDEAL WIFE
HER HUSBAND'S BEST HELPER
Vigorous Health Is the Great Source of
the Power to Inspire and Encourage
-All Women Should Seek It.
\u25a0 One of the most noted, successful and
richest men of this century, in a recent
article, has said, " Whatever I am and
whatever ; success ' I - have attained , in
this world I owe all to' toy wif ci From
the day I first 1 knew her she has been
an inspiration, and the greatest -Help-
mate of my life."

To be such a successful wife, to re-
tain ; the : love and admiration of her
husband, to inspire him to - make the .
most of himself, should, be a woman's
constant study. /
'~* If a' woman ' finds that ' her . â¢ner^ies
are flawing-, that she yete easily tired,
dark shadows appear under her eyes,
she has backache, headaches, bearing-
down pains,* nervousness," whites,' irreg-
ularities or the blues, she should start
at f once to ) build up her system' by a
tonic with" specific powers, such as
; Lydia >E. â¢Pinkham's -Vegetable Cbm-
poundi;^ V . :.-
\u25a0Following we publish -by request a
letter from a young wife :
Dear Mrs. Pinkham: * :
*" ; Â£ Ever since my child was born I hare Â«uf-
s f ered, as I hope few women ever have, with in-
flammation, female weakness,' bearing-down

meals, and half my time was spent in bed.

The * District -? Council :' of Painters of : San
Francisco, .' in - mass meeting * assembled, de
nounce the action taken by the Building Trades
Council- of thie' city, . whereby: an indorsement,
of ,a - candidate \u25a0 for Mayor has; been published
in J theT papers jof this city, S for . the : following
reasons : ,-.--,â¢."â¢-'.'â¢ .-".- - ; \u25a0"\u25a0 -' \u25a0\u25a0 . \u25a0..'.---' .<
! rThaf.the unions affiliated "with the Building
Trades Council ' are forbidden by- their National
Constitution and \u25a0 Local By-Laws to enter in
any way. into politics. . - .
That \u25a0 euch ! an indorsement is I misleading to
the public i and the tradÂ« unionists in general
is a tact to any one who has ever been a mem
ber of a union or a secret society of any kind.
We all know I that ttie rank and file of any
organization do not attend the meetings, that in
most -instances -less than one-tenth' of the
membership -attend; this one-tenth constitute
the leaders or mure appropriately speaking the
active members. : \u25a0- .- - . ' : :'
Â» : : Therefore*it -iÂ« an eaay matter \u25a0 for . an un
scrupulous.leader of any union to work through
the union an indorsement tor any one. .
"Take, for instance, a union having 1600 mem
' beru on Â» tbelr ' roll, there are less . than 100
present at thÂ« meeting, a proposition, to .in
, dorsa som* one < comes -up . and carries by a
small majority. That is where less than 5 per,
cent of the membership try to make the public
believe through their spokesman, P. H. Mc-
Carthy, that a union of lt>oO members have in
dorsed some on* for Mayor. \u25a0
This, as you see. is utterly false and mislead
in*. ? '-vv â¢-.<,\u25a0-:-. \u25a0\u25a0 .. â¢â¢-\u25a0.\u25a0 ' .
- > MCCARTHY'S POLICY.
- The ralicy' of 'P. H. McCarthy is not to neat
any delegate in the Building Trades Council
who is unfriendly to himself, therefore he is
able to perpetuate himself In office.
j If a union should become convinced that the
methods, of - the . Building; Trades Council) werÂ«
corrupt,* and elect a set of delegates opposed
to the corruption, the delegates would not be
seated,' and in the event of the union refusing
to change their delegates, then the union ia
either suspended or disrupted.-
This is the case of Local Union No. ' 19 of
the : Painters and Decorators, ateo of Paper
hangers' Local Union* No. 609 of this city. Both
are affiliated with this District Council.
\u25a0 The unions at an election held in December,
1903, elected \u25a0 delegates opposed to the corrup
tion and political graft of the Building Trade*
Council,' then opposed to the present adminis
tration. * \u25a0- .:;.' " , ; - - :
As both unions were strong numerically and
would not recede, the Building Trades Council
through P. H. McCarthy went to work with
his frienda ' within the unions to disrupt the
two organizations, which be succeeded in doing.
â¢'For eighteen months we have put up with all
the persecutions possible for P. H. McCarthy
to launch against us.
We will not at this time go into details
regarding the controversy, but will only men
tion the fact that P. H. McCarthy's faction of
our union at that time, through the' attorney
of the Building Trades Council;. Mr. Cleveland
L. ' Dam, brought-, suit against' us - for : posses
sion -of, the property of - the union. . and .to
restrain us . from using the designation "Local
Union . No. j 19." : The ; suit was brought . in the '
Superior Court,' Hon. Judge- Hunt presiding,'
and- we i were ably represented by Hon. Julius
Kahn. . ',-- '' . - - :-. -' . - ' . . -
The result of the trial ' was a complete
vindication to us.'; . ';-..: â¢-,--,\u25a0-. " \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0
THEIR VOTES NOT A CHATTEL.
< But P.JH. McCarthy,, who has stated that
he is greater than the law. brands the decision
rendered - by - Hon.: Judge Hunt as \u25a0 onÂ© ren
dered ': in the interests, of the Citizens' Al
liance and one that the Building Trades Coun-.
cil will not in. any way recognize: in fact,-. P.
H. McCarthy is | using the power of the Build
ing TradÂ«s Council, up to the present time, to
have members of I our union struck against,
thereby violating- the decision of the Hon.
Judge Hunt. ; His : strength as to unions is
his weakness politically, for the reason that
an intelligent union 'man Is not going to allow
any. one, even if he be a political labor boss,
to .insinuate that he will vote for Â± any par
ticular candidate. 'V "
P. H.' McCarthy' has tried at various times
and ' in political parlance "'got behind" both
Republican and '. Democratic nominees. " These
nominees, -. no doubt, . believed ' that P. H. Mc-
Carthy had the 30,000 votesi he claimed to have
but the facts are that there 'are only 12,410
carrying the Building \u25a0 Trades Counc.ll card. .
The results show . that the majority of the
worklngmen will not . stand \u25a0to have their vote
delivered to \u25a0 give prestige or financial emolu
ments to a political labor leader.; -:- .'\u25a0 - â¢
Workingmen are too honest to change their
political faith ; as often: as does P. H. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Mc-
Carthy, and were, they Inclined. to do so. would
not.. receive in proportion the. compensation
given the : leader.'. â¢. . ;â¢*' "â¢ \u25a0...\u25a0-\u25a0â¢ \
These axe. a few of the "reasons why the
District Council of Painters oppose . the intro
duction ' of â¢ politics into unions. \u25a0 especially, by
a central body known as. the Building Trades
Council : and '; presided over ' by , P. H. â¢ McCar
thy, who Is able to hold his Job only through'
tho-infilfference of the vast majority, the rank
and file, the best of the trades unionists.

The tennis experts of "the California
Tennis Club met in a "handicap doubles
tournament yesterday - for the : Directors'
cups, and an Interesting competition . re
sulted.'-.-\u25a0; Eleven teams competed, ".. ;the
largest entry list a club tournament -has
attracted for some ! time. V- At : the > end ; of
/theday's play^ three teams remained un
defeated. Carl Gardner and Melville Long
reached the finals and will meet the win
ner ;of the match ', between Herbert Long
and Frank Mitchell and Charles Kuehn
and H. A. BIddle: * - , â¢ '
Although the handicaps-were liberal the
matches in many. 'cases were one-sided.
Mitchell arid Long and Gardner and Long
both played from 15 3-6 .back of j scratch,
while the limit , team received SO. Gardner
and Long * won both -! their matches in
straight jsets, while Mitchell and Long
figured in two close . matches. Beyf uss
and C. Smi^h,- winners of the last tourna
ment; were beaten.in the first -round in
straight sets by.Kenyoff and Nourse.
The most interesting match played was
that between Harry Rolf e and Henry Mills
and Frank Mitchell : and Herbert Long.
The former received â¢ owe odds of 15; and
they I proved about ; right./ Rolf c played
good tennis \ throughout the match,* but
his partner was . rather [ erratic. Mitchell
and Long took all kinds of chances, and
after losing the first set pulled out the
next two handily. Long's driving was the
feature of the match.
. The only other three-set match wu
played by B. F. : Nourse and Albert Ken
yon arid Major Ducat and N. Blaisdell.
The latter received odds of 15 3-Â« and owe
8-6. . After -winning the second set - they
failed to take a game in the third. Nourse
and : Kenyon i disposed â¢ of . Bey fuss and
Smith easily, but were in turn beaten by
Gardner and M. Long. The latter allowed
a handicap of owe 15 to Nourse and Ken
yon. and lost only one game in two sets:
The j winners played fast" tennis in thU
match and their, opponents S were com
pletely outclassed. ' . \u25a0\u25a0' .'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
H. A. Blddle and C. G. Kuehn met "W.
G. Knowlton a'ndDr. Lovegrove on even
terms and a * close match resulted. All
four are third class men, but they played
very good tennis. Knowlton's terrific
drive was not lacking in speed, but was
a little 'off' on direction. The doctor's pe
culiar 'service w"as -not as effective , as
usual, and Biddle and Kuehn won both
sets by small margins.
_'The tournament will be completed next
Sunday, when M. Long and Gardner (owe

dltlons I have named, the use of supplement
ary i books has been a growth of such_vigorous
nature that Its proportions have become for
midable, y
It is safe to say that the supplementary
books in the I school houses of California to
day-represent an outlay of several hundred
thousands of dollars. This Is In striking con
trast with the conditions that prevailed with
in the recollection of many, when "Webster's
Elementary â¢ Spelling Book" sufficed as a text
for the whole curriculum of the primary schools
These many books now in use have been pur
i chased from public school funds in the manner
I have heretofore described. It is doubtless
due to their \u25a0' not having been a direct cost
to uchool -. patrons that no serious complaint
has been made. But they have cost the com
munity; been a burden' to the tax-paying
public. "We are confronted with at least two
Questions :: "Are so many books necessary?"
V Are. the schools receiving from them a benefit
commensurate with the expense?"
iWe may find -an answer v*> these Inquiries
by first learning the purposes a supplementary
book is ~ Intended to .serve. It Is I believe
conceded by .everybody, except book publish
ers and their agents, that perfection has never
yet been attained . in the making of any text
book. Some - have been made that are good
a few very good, but many are poor.- or in
different, or wholly, worthless for school use
Educational authorities tell us that concen
tration ,is a crying need in our schools of
to-day. \u25a0
The displacement of any text-book of /the'
prescribed State series by t any other text
and the use of the latter Instead, Is plainly
a violation of the statutes.

Just sl3 the baseball fans at Recrea
tion Park were muttering too bad and
o:her sweet and consoling words, Joe
waded Into one of Ham Ibcrg's
bositatisg twists and knocked it out of
the lot byway of the left field fenca
ruute. Hlldebrand was gracing third
I>.ise at the time and he arrived also.
Taat little wallop made a deadlock that
lasted four innings more till Jimmy
liyrnes brcke it up in the twelfth.
The Sunday multitude saw more good
baseball yesterday In. two hours than
the every day rooters who were look
ing to witness sensations ail week.
Tney saw a rally that was positively
the most heartrending and wildeyed
the Seals ever made and they saw more
long drives than have been pulled off
on the lot for many a moon.
It looked like nightcaps for Uncle
\u25a0with the score 5 to 0 against -him In
eighth epasm. but .in baseball you
,^k- A ver can tell what they will put over.
65ea and>Whalen bit off chunky little
hits and iWaidron walloped one over
DunJeavy's head for "two bases and it
was 5 to 2." Kid Mohler could not
make good, but alalng. came Hildebrand
with a drive into left that let little
W'ally scoot through.
Some one remarked that if "Joe Neal
on would clout the leather out of the
lot the score would be a tie. Every
body Â«lse laughed at the Joke for about
two seconds. Then one of Ham Iberg*s
floaters floated its way toward the rub
ber and Joe waded la and met it. That
\u25a0was aIL Over, i.be" left flejd . fence it 1
Bailed, accompanied by the music that
resulted" fr.ora: the .wild cheering of the
rabble. <
After that It was real baseball for
four more ir.nings. Both pitchers
swore tlwy would win and -their oaths
were kept iiii Jimmy. Whalea fell down

chances and chances for either team to

the Commuters with, a 'two-cushion
smack over the.f irst bag. Moskiman
Sol a walk and Kelly dumped a bunt
Â£t the plate that proved a clever sac

one out t*> the* farthest cornerrof the
left garden; ,and ' then , they .all went

Shea opened up. the tenth' for Uncle
with a pretty two-bag smash out to left
field. He was so anxious to go the
whole route that he cut first base about
ten feet. As Umpire Bull Perrine was
looKingr. the runner was called out.
\&n Haltren in the. eleventh placed a
single into right. Spencer Returned the
ban to first and the throw was bad.
Van ran for the bag and. as he had
already tamed on his way. to second.

TACOJIA.. TIGERS ARE DOWXED.
Seattle Taken Ttto Gtmti, Jinking
Seven la a Row.
SEATTLE, Sept.. IT. â Seattle took a
double header from the champions to
day, setting them at the foot of the
1 list and rounding out seven straight
g-am'es in which the local team led the
\u25a0core. The home team had the. largest
crowd ever ?eea at Recreation gounds
to witness the result. Rube Vickera
! got his baptism by being pitted against
: Bobby Keefe. the best Tacoma has in
the shop. The; ungainly Rube did not
' give the semblance of a hit. for eight
I ' innings. Happy Hogan,' Tjatting for
: Keefe, then broke the spell 'by cutting
; one inside of first base, which Hurley
knocked down, but could not get the
batter. X>ovle made a' clean- hit to cen
ter, but Kane whipped the ball to sec
ond ahead of Hogan, 'making one of
the best plays of the game. Nordyka
followed with, a" double and 'Eagan
punched out a single, scoring two
earned runs, but as the locals had three
they "cantered home with the game.
In the second 'game both" Oscar
Jones and Fitzgerald were, pounded
hard, and the game was a "see-saw, af
fair from start to finish." \u25a0
Seattle presented a lot of new faces
in Vickers, Jones, Lauterborn'and.HUr
ley. They all- made good. Karle was
switched to the outfield, his proper
position, and he was the hit of the
piece. Twice he robbed Truck Eagan
of long hits by great bursts of speed.
The batting and base running of Ben
nett was a feature.' The scores:

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 17.â Los Ange
les lost to Portland to-day^ *A.lthough
Goodwin and Jones allowed but six hits
each, the former was wild arid three
of the runs scored by the visitors were
the indirect result of bases on balls.
Portland was also'able to hit' the ball
with men on bases. The fielding of
Cravath and Flood were features, each
making: several spectacular catches.
Each side made three errors, but those
\of Portland were the more costly. The
umpiring of Davis occasioned frequent
disputes to-day, both jsides objecting to
his decisions. Catcher McLean was put
ptt the grounds' for questioning a de
cision. The score:

Although the Son of Ben

Special Dissatch to TfcÂ« \u25a0 Call.
NEW. YORK, Sept. 17.-^A ' heavy : card
of seven races Is down for decision [at
Gravesend to-morrow afternoon and as
every event is filled to the brim specu
lation should be brisk. , The'number of
maiden two-year-old fillies T - and \ geld
lngrs Is the cause of the extra race
and even then some have to be ex
cluded. The Speculation Stakes, is the
only fixture and as it" haa selling con-,
ditlons only selling platers aspire to it.
\u25a0Since the" Saratoga t meetlng Yalagal
has been a disappointment and it is
time she redeemed Herself. This filly
showed unusually high, class at the
springs, so much so that she was men
tioned in the same breath as Whimsi
cal, and it seemed sheÂ£" deserved it."
Yalag-al should win the first race to
morrow. The steeplechase may go to
Maiden. \u25a0' \u25a0 r" Z^JO " .".\u25a0
I It -did not take Roseben long to re
gain his form. After his last excellent
'race it is useless' to pick anything to
j beat him in the. third race.
â¢ If Ocean liae runs to her best form,
something she has not been in the
habit of doing lately, she should, win
the Speculation. She has been show
ing just enough speed recently to keep
herself noticed, but has failed miser
ably* when it came to the stretch show
down. Rose of Dawn, Glenecho, Jac
quin. and Oarsman, are also about the
only ones that need be considered and
they are all dangerous. The distance
may not be quite far enough for Glen
echo, but it exactly suits the others.
Oarsman ran to his best form last time
he started and he is not likely to have
deteriorated. Right Royal should not
be left out when mentioning possibili
ties, for he is good now and the weight
should suit him. S .
Rose of Dawn looks promising in the
fifth. A poor field of maiden young
sters is carded in the sixth race and
any one of them may be successful.
Pantoiifle is preferred. Society Bud has
shown the best form of t"hose entered
in -the last race and at the weights
looks like the good thing. The day's

CLEVER GUNMEN WHO TIED IN THIS SHARP COMPETITION FOR THE PA- I
CIFIC COAST HANDICAP PLUEROCK TROPHY ' AT INGLESIDE YESTER
. DAY. IN THE SHOOT-OFF MR.* SYLVESTER WON. BY ONE BIRD. I
The Pacific Coast handicap at blue'rocks,* which was decided. at the Ingleslde
traps yesterday; was one Tof the best' contested events of its kind f ever held In this
city. The^handicap was won by George Sylvester of the Union Gun Club, who de
feated Robert Bungay of Los Angeles in the shoot-off after a tie.
Both men made the exceptionally, high ' score of 97 breaks out of a possible
100, records which would do credit to any gunmen. The handicap excited unusual
enthusiasm. As well as. attracting: the best amateur gunmen in the State to en
ter, it drew, a large gallery of spectators, who showed great interest in the pas
time. The presence of the greatest trap shots in the" t country also drew many.
Sylvester and Bungay both shot from the sixteen-yard mark. Sylvester lost
one bird in his first fifteen, while Bungay made a clean score. Both made clean
scores In the next fifteen. In the next sets' of twenty and fifteen Sylvester did
some phenomenal shooting. In his fifth frame of fifteen he lost two, and "then
broke at least twenty birds without a miss. When Bungay. came to shoot his last
set of twenty it seemed his chances of carrying off * the purse and the beautiful
silver cup were slender.. His only chance was for a tie, and to do this he was
forced to break. twenty bluerocks consecutively. This he did, and he was given a
great reception for his clever work.
â¢ As first and second money amounted to - $284, they decided to split :the . purse
and shoot at twenty birds for the championship and for the artistic silver cup.
The shoot-off kept the spectators breathless," for first one man was ) ahead and .
then the other, until Sylvester finally w on D y one bird,* breaking 17 to Btingay>
16. Sylvester shot first and lost the fifth, eighth and thirteenth birds. Bungay lost
the fourth, eighth, fifteenth and eighteenth birds. .
The all-star team, composed of Mar 8a all, Crosby, Gilbert. Helkes and Powers,
was defeated by the members of the GG o lden Gate Club team, composed" of ' Nau
mann. Fanning, Schultz,- Webb and Feudner. The Easterners shot from "the
twenty-yard mark, while the locals stood at the sixteen-yard mark.
â¢â"\u25a0 The all-star teanvwas the center of attraction, and T." Marshall, the ; veteran
champion, was forced to Introduce each of the shooters individually.- Mr. Mar
shall, as well as being one of the greate a t shotgun experts in the" country, ls'*n

When Knockout Is Shown
Detective Phil O'Neill ot Sacramento"
eerved a subpena on Billy Nolan Saturday
night requiring the latter to appear be- <
fore the Grand Jury at the capital city :
the first week In October and unburden â¢
himself of all he knows about the alleged â¢'
corruption fund. Nolan Intended to leave â¢
the city An a few days.** but " he will re- \
main for 'the purpose of informing the up- ]
country inquisitorial body on the methods
; that are said to have been used to keep
t the fight game going.
I O'Neill, was said to be, there with a.'
bunch of subpenas that would keep the
prizefight promoters and managers on the :\u25a0
"hotfoot for the timbers tor days to come.:
but the only one served was that which
O'Neill flashed a.t Nolan. The detective
seemed to think his duty was performed/
when he got through with. that- one. -.forv
he spent the rest of his time tn wander
ing about the town and taking a look at
the interesting things always to be seen
here.
It is evidently the plan of District At-.;
torney Arthur Seymour ot Sacramento to:
get at the bottom of the alleged corrun-*
tiorv fund. He is busy at the present tlmev
[figuring out ways and means to line up,
the alleged offenders before the Grand â¢
Jury. .Seymour has been spurred on by;
the notoriety he is receiving. The major- .
ity of the knowing ones only smile at his
efforts to unearth a scandal.
Manager Jim Coffroth has not as yet
come through with that forfeit money he.
is holding out on Billy Nolan. It Is evi-'
dently, .the Intention of the promoter toj
keep the coin himself. Nolan, says be is'
going to get It back at all hazards. Cot-.
â¢ froth does not say what he is going to do I
'with the roll, but he holds fast to It at'
present. Â» â¢ : .
Battling Nelson finished his engagemenfi
at the California Theater last night, and
to-morrow morning he will leave with his -
father for Portland to visit the fair. He
will join the company again on September 1
26 and go over the Northwest circuit., He i
signed a contract last night to remain
with the show for ten weeks.
Jimmy Britt was given a private view
of the moving pictures on Saturday night. ,
and bo realistic were they that James
was entirely carried away. In the six
teenth and seventeenth rounds he got up
and yelled. "I am winning! I will get
him!" The nÂ«xt round there was a falter,
and Jimmy saw himself lying helpless on
the ropes. He turned away suddenly
and left the place in a state of sorrow.
Manager y ,WlUus ( ,Britt will start \u25a0 East
with the "moving 'pictures" this morning
on the 9:30 o'clock train. He will go di
rect to Chicago, thence to New York, to
arrange for the booking of the exhibition,
which is expected to return a fortune to,
the firm of Coffroth & Britt. . â¢
Jimmy Britt opens at the California
Theater this evening In "The , Kentucky
Belles." a musical extravaganza. Jimmy
will box a few rounds at each perform
ance, besides handing out a bit *of his
original monologue. All his friends will
be there to welcome him and it Is expect
ed he will pack the house all week. *

Clinging to the bottom of, his overturned

Johnson, an employe ' of . the North Shore
Railroad, residing . in Sausalito, was I res*

lives ; at -760 ] Fifth- street, Oakland. The
Deputy Fish Commissioner ; and his com
panions had been ' on , a fishing trip out
side J the t heads, and were returning to
pakland when; their attention was called
to Johnson's perilous position by his cries
for help. ' \u25a0 . .
* For '.some time . the rescuers were un
able to locate the cries," as the capsized
skiff , to which he clung.. was almost hid
den from ; their view, by the* waves. They
finally sighted .the : i half-drowned fisher
man, and after â¢ some . trouble brought
their launch alongside, the boat, which
was drifting out to sea with the ebbing
tide.- v .\u25a0: :.--\u25a0: \u25a0--\u25a0:\u25a0/.: . .. : ,. \u25a0; . - ?â¢-\u25a0
Johnson was almost' dead from expos
ure, for he had been clinging to the bot
tom of the. boat for several hours,' and
when saved was on- the .point of being
washed from his slippery , support. He
was, at once taken to the life-saving sta
tion near the Cliff House, and after. being
cared for there was sent to his home in
Sausalito.
In .getting Johnson Into the launch
Gooch had a narrow; escape from death,
as he was almost .thrown from the launch
as the boat pitched on the ocean swell.
