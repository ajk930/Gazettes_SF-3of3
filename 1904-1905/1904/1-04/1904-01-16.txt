dtement prevailed at Kelliher, a new
border town twenty miles north of here,
all last night and to-day it continued
over a shooting affair that starf ed In a
gambling-house.
The house was surrounded all night by
a score of armed men who were trying
to get a man named Plummer and a
woman companion who had ejected the
proprietor of the house from the place
at the point of their revolvers and then
began to "shoot the place up" in real
istic border fashion. When the Inmate3
were driven out the Town Council as
sembled and called for volunteers. Each
man was furnished with a rifle and a
quart bottle of whisky, the latter as *
stimulant against the cold.
The house was riddled with bullets.
The couple in the house wrecked the in
terior with axes and fired at every one
who .came within range. The battle
continued until midnight, when a truce
was arranged until this morning. The
Town Marshal was wounded slightly.
The besieged persons then took turns
at/ watching and sleeping, and occa
sionally a shot was fired. In the mean
time the Sheriff from Beverfdge was
summoned. .

married and was away on his wed
ding trip,' and his two sisters were
alone in the house. Fedyez was-en
deavoring to pry open a window when
the young ladies discovered him. As
they had neither revolver nor gun in
the house, they went for clubs. As the
marauder was about to enter the win
dow ' neighbors armed with shotguns
arrived on the scene. Fedyez started
to run and several shots were fired.
Herbert Walker, whose home had been
robbed, finally shot the fleeing burglar
in, the "head, slightly wounding him.
Fedyez fell," and Robert Frtmlln,, a
Bcer.^war veteran, pounced oh top of
him. ' A desperate battle ensued, but

The story of the chase and capture
of the two brothers is a vivid one and
reads like a tale from a yellow covered
novel. A telegram which was dis
patched by a clerk formerly In the em
ploy of the Sproats to a small town in
Nevada gave the detectives a clew,
which they followed diligently till their
efforts v.ere finally rewarded with the
capture of both men.
BOTH BROTHERS DISAPPEAR.
When the Sproat brothers suddenly
dropped out of Eight a few days after
their failure, in the latter part of De
cember, the members of the Board of
Trade called a special session and de
cided to bring the accused men back
to face trial at any cost. It was first
suggested that the matter be put Into
the hands of the Police Department,
but on second consideration the mem
bers of the board decided that the case
would attain too much publicity, and
finally it was intrusted to the Curtin
Detective Agency.
Principal Miles Bolger, the head of
the agency,-" at once began to look for a
possible clew as to the thereabouts of
the brothers. A warrant was secured
against Edward in this city, and an
other was sworn to by a San Jose iruit
man for the arrest of Samuel.
Edward was traced to Utah, where
he suddenly threw his pursuers off his
trail. There seemed but little chance of
apprehending him, so the detectives
finally decided not to molest- Samuel,
but to use him as a decoy by which
to trail his brother.
Samuel dropped out of town sev
eral times and always reappeared. His
movements were closely watched by
the sleuths and about a week ago he
was seen in consultation with Arthur
W. Wiscomt confidential clerk of the
bankrupt firÂ»n, who. was looking after
the Interests of both men.
WIscomb was followed by one of
the detectives to J the Western
Union Telegraph office, where
he sent a message. He had the words
roughly scrawied on the back of an
envelope and after leaving the office
tore the envelope into small piece*,
and threw them into the street.
TELEGRAM SUGGESTS A CLEW.
The detective picked up the small
scraps and after three hours of dili
gent work finally pasted ttjem togeth
er. The message read: "J. H. Wilson.
Toano, Xev. I have no troubles. HavÂ«Â»
you?" This message proved the un
doing of Edward Sproat. for a detec
tive was at once sent to Toano, wher*Â»
Edward Sproat was living under the
name of Wilson. The detective
reached there about twenty-fou^
liours after Edward Sproat had left
that place on his way to Los Angeles.

try and the Philippines that now have
It. Sound ball cartridges will be sub
stituted for it and great danger due to
dependence on cartridges that are not
reliable will be removed.
No one person is held responsible for
this defect. It is regarded as the nat
ural result of inadequate ordnance
manufacturing facilities in this coun
try in time of war. The Government
manufactures its own ammunition
now, l>ut it did not do so during the
Spanish-American- war. Nor was there
always time to make contracts for such
ammunition as was needed. The War
Department, frequently went into the
open market and bought large quan
tities from private firms, accepting this
ammunition sometimes without the
usual inspection by an army officer,
but taking a guarantee of the firm that
the ammunition was sound. ,\
Such was the case with a large por
tion of ammunition for caliber 30 rifles
and carbines. Large purchases were
made in New York at an approximate
price of $17 a thousand. Delivery was
made quickly. The 3,000,000 rounds
now found defective â of which about
2,000,000 rounds is In Manila â cost

FOR FIGHTERS
SAN JOSE DE GUATMAS. Jan. 15.â
Captain Felipe Alvidres. at the head
of a hundred soldiers of the Twentieth
Battelion of Mexican regulars, rode
into San Jose de Guaymas late Thurs
day night, bringing the first news of
a battle with the Seri Indians, which
took place in the San Ursula Moun
tains three days ago. The party, under
Captain Alvidres, had been in pursuit
of the Indians for three weeks, hav
ing taken their trail shortly after the
massacre at El Poso ranch, perpetrated
by the Indians when they first crossed
from their native island of Tiburon, in
the Gulf of California. Many times
the Indian band of about forty braves
eluded Alvidres and his men and suc
ceeded in avoiding a fight just as their
pursuers were on their heels and a bat
tle seemed inevitable. Finally, op Mon
day, the Mexican troops caught up with
the savage Seris at a point in the
mountains called the Lion's Head, and
while the Indians weTe not hemmed in
they grave battle, knowing that a con
flict would result sooner or later.
The flsht was short and hot. ThÂ©
entire band of Indians, the most of
whom were mounted on stolen horses,
wheeled in their saddles and turned
upon the pursuing party, be:.: on over
whelming them in one grand rush. Had
It not been for Alvidres, they might
have been successful, but he lined up
his men and met the onslaught with a
deadly fire. Eight of the Seris fell
from their horses dead and many of
them had their animals shot from un
der * them, while others escaped, al
though badly wounded. In the mean
time their comrades had wrought havoc
in the ranks of the opposing forces, and
a dozen Mexican troopers had fallen,
several of them seriously wounded, but
fortunately none were killed. The Serla
took advantage of the demoralizing ef
fect of their charge upon the Mexican
forces and made their escape through
a pass In the mountains, carrying away
i their wounded and leaving their dead
! on the field.
Alvidres saw that further pursuit was
hopeless and, believing that the In
dians, if left alone, would return to
their native island, he withdrew to San
Jose de Guaymas to await orders frot.v
his superiors. S

academic and said he would not argue
the case on that general ground. He
was willing to discuss the question as

city to that point. With the evident
intention of* abandoning the narrqw
gauge service between this city- and
Oakland, the company has had a gang
of men. employed in the shops here for
a number of days unlimbering the rr\a
jor portion of the rolling-stock, which
is being shipped to Nevada for use on
the Carson and Colorado road, in which
It is interested. Only enough of the
narrow-gauge stock will be retained
at this end of the line to handle traf

it is said that as soon as a third rail
can be laid between Wrights station
and Santa Cruz and several tunnels
widened the balance of the narrow
gauge rolling-stock will either be sent
to the Carson and Colorado road or
disposed of by sale to the new road to
be buHt between Tonopah and Rhodes

which Is about to begin the construc

been negotiating for some of the en

"If," responded Teller,' "there Is
not a republican form of government In
Colorado, there Is a Republican admin

When Teller ceased speaking the
Senate passed j a large number of pri

passed the" following bills : Creating a

"I'll try*\to take care of my own

when I cannot do that I will ask some
member of my own family to do so."
Tl. . colloquy* . caused a general out
burst of laughter. After It subsided
Spooner concluded his statement, say
ing that he was willing to confess
that he "ad not reached a conclusion in
his own mind.
"I am not willing to concede the
right, of international eminent domain,
but I cannot find It in r-<y heart to deny
it."
Teller took issue with the Presi

On cross-examination by Douglass
Heath said ,,that after an article had
been adopted by the department and its
price fixed, and It had become a stand
ard article of supply, the signing of
requisitions would be a matter of rou
tine. He admitted that on "the face of
some of the documents shown him the
reduction in the price of. the fasteners
from $1 50 to $1 25 each was a voluntary
and spontaneous act of Machen's.
MACHEN IS PRAISED:
Heath then detailed the rapid growth
of the rural free delivery service and
said he regarded Machen as a very
competent man.
"He was the very father of the sys
tem, was he not?" Douglass asked.
"At least one of them,-' the witness
replied. Â¦Â¦."'Â¦. -
On redirect examination Heath said
that Machen did not have the right to
establish the standard of an article or
its price without consultation with the
First Assistant Postmaster General, nor
would any clerk have that right. He
said he did not remember having seen
f.ny other device or any proposition in
volving fasteners brought to his at
tention during his term of office.
Heath was then excused and former
First Assistant Postmaster General
Johnston took the stand. He had, he
said, no recollection of any conversa

Mrs. de Lucca informed Deputy Cor

the last five months, and that in an
swer to her repeated complaints the
gas company had sent men to her

had failed to do so.
Miss Nellie Cook, 26 yearr old, and
residing with her aunt, Mrs. Addle do
Lucca at 1912 Taylor street, was as
phyx.ated by gas Thursday night. It
was Miss Cook's custom to arise at 5

'be about yesterday, Mrs. Je Lucca
went to her room and found her lying

with gas. The key of the gas burner
was partly Â¦ turned open and some of
Miss Cook's wearing appa: : was bang.

The Coroner was notified and the
bodies were removed to the Morgue.

his wife five years his junior. He was

Patrolman J. Tillman was summoned
and broke In the door. An examination
showed that both had been dead sev
eral- ours. The room was filled with
escaping gas from a defective wall
bracket to which was attached a tube
running to a two-burner gas stove.
The stopcock of the bracket was fully
turned on and the cocks to the gas
stove burners were closed. It is sup
posed that upon retiring Thursday
night Layton turned off , the gas stove
cocks, which under ordinary circum
stances would have prevented any
leakage of gas, but owing to the condi
tion of the bracket the room soon filled
with gas. The unfortunate man. " no
doubt awoke with scattered senses,
'then became dizzy and clutched the
sides of the table for cupport. f^nd his
body was found in that position. A pe
culiar feature of the affair is* that a
lighted coal oil lamp was found on a
chair near the bed and It is regarded
as miraculous that an explosion did not
occur.
About T o'clock yest.rday morning
Mrs: Arneson. who conducts the lodg

acted, detected the odor of gas, but she
made no investigation. About 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon J. P. Livingston
called at the house to secure a room.
He noticed the odor of gas and called
the attention of Mrs. Arneson to that
fact. Upon investigating ! found that
it came from the room occupied by the
unfortunate couple. The door was
locked and Livingston climbed over a

The stamp, he said, was used only
for formal matters, and it had not been

In opening the proceedings Mr. Cham

United States and Germany had ac

denied' that any tariff could be framed
here which, as its opponents alleged,
would make the rich richer â¢Â¦â¢ and the
poor poorer. The United States under

CRAMPS WILL BUILD
TWO NEW BATTLESHIPS
Soeder intended to kill Blaise with the
deadly poison, but feared detection and
finally decided to stab his victim to
death. â¢
This theory is borne out by the evi
dence that, on Friday last, Soeder took
the trunk from the, Flatley house to the
Five-Mile House, telling Mike Risso,
the landlord, to destroy it if he did not
call for it in three or four days.
The police think that It may have
been Soeder's intention to use the
poison when he placed it in his trunk
and took the trunk to the Five-Mile
House.
At that time he. had evidently in
mind to make use of the deadly acid,
and for that reason had it where he
could lay his hands upon it, at the
same time guarding himself by not
having It in his room where It could
be seen.
In case he finally made up his mind
not to use the poison, he evidently re
lied on the destruction of his trunk, as
he had instructed the owner of the
Five-Mile House.
That Soeder should have hesitated
to use deadly poison in killing Blaise
for the purpose of securing the insur-
DECIDED TO USE A KNIFE.
The killing of the dog of the Flatleys
on the same night is thought to have
been an experiment as to the power of
the acid. The police now think that
He placed the poison for safe keep
ing in his trunk and left it at the
Flatley home. When his victim was
brought to this city and insurance had
been secured on his life, Soeder cun
ningly secured possession of the poison
by burglarizing the Flatley basement
and broke open the lock of his trunk
to color the suspicion that thieves had
done the work.
TESTED POWER OF ACID.
The valise was found by Detective
Gibson In Soeder's room at 827 Jackson
street and it was positively identified
by Miss Flatley as the one she had
seen In Soader's trunk. ,
In the face of the develooments sur
rounding the possession by Soeder of
hydrocyanic acid, the theory is that
he planned to kill Blaise by use of
the deadly solution before he went to
Germany to induce his victim to come
to America.
Flatley home, broke open his own trunk
and removed the valise containing the
bottles is beyond any question.
POLICE JUDGE CABAXISS SIGNING WARRANT FOR ARREST OF LEON SOEDER ON CHARGE OF WILL
FUL MURDER OF JOSEPH BLAISE. FACSIMILE OF THE DOCUMENT, AND PORTRAIT OF THE AC
CUSED MAN TAKEN YESTERDAY IN THE CITY PRISON.
Ten days ago the basement of the
Flatley home was entered at night, and
the next day it was discovered that
the lock on Boeder's trunk had. been
broken open and the valise containing
the bottles had been stolen. A favorite
dog belonging to the Flatley family
was poisoned the same night the bur
glary occurred. The matter was . re
ported to the police by Miss Flatley's
brother the following day.
Last Friday Soeder* removed his
trunk front the Flatley home and took
it to the Five-Mile House. When It
was recovered by the police, two days
after Blaise was murdered, the trunk
contained two bottles of hydrocyanic
acid; the most deadly of poisons. It
is assumed that Soeder replaced the
bottles in the trunk. '
That Soeder himself burglarized the
DEADLY SOLUTION* STOLEN*.
The detectives on the case are strain
ing every nerve to find some one who
saw Soeder and Blaise together after
tliey left the Mexican restaurant at 721
Broadway last Sunday evening.
With that link of evidence se.-ured,
the chain of testimony against Soeckr
will be complete.
That Soeder contemplated the use of
deadly poison in making away with
Blaise Is one of the theories' of th-Â»
police borne out by evidence they have
secured.
In addition to the finding of two bot
tles of hydrocyanic add in Soe
der's trunk at the Five-Mile House,
as published exclusively In The Call
yesterday, evidence Is now forthcoming
showing that Soeder had the deadly
poison In his possession at his room
two days before Blaise was slaught
ered..
When Soeder went to Germany a few
months a*o he left his trunk at the
home of Miss Katherine Flatley, 200
Marshall street. Miss Flatley is the
young woman who informed Chief of
Police Wittman that Soeder desired to
marry her. and recently told her that
he was about to receive the sum of
$7000 from Germany, which statement
was also exclusively published In The
Call last Thursday.
Miss Flatley has given the police fur
theV Information. She states that when
8oeder left the trunk at her house she
saw it opened by htm and that it con
tained a small valise, in which were
some bottles. Â¦Â¦

The attorneys for Soeder briefly ad
dressed the court and explained that
they had asked for the writ 0/ habeas
corpus on Thursday because they had
been denied access to Soeder and that
there was no charge against him at the
time.
Judge Dunne then ordered the writ
of habeas corpus to be dismissed and
remanded Soeder into the custody of
the police. Soeder watched the pro
ceedings with interest, and he asked
one of his attorneys in German as' to
#vhat evidence had been secured
against him by the police.
Soeder was taken from the court
room by Detective Gibson and again
placed in the "tanks" at the Clty
Prison.
The man accused of a foul murder
had but two visitors yesterday. One
was his principal attorney and the oth
er was the city undertaker, who de
sired to know whether Soeder would
pay for the burial of the body of Blaise.
Soeder showed no signs of emotion when
the undertaker told him that the body
of Blaise would be buried at the ex
pense of the city unless Soeder could
arrange otherwise.
Soeder informed the undertaker that
he had no money to pay for the burial
of Blaise, and the interview ended. The
bedy of Blaise was turned over yes
terday to the city undertaker and Jt
will be buried among the indigent dejd
at Sunset Cemetery, in San Mateo
County.
With the mass of evidence that has
accumulated against Soeder in the last
few days, the police declare that they
will have but litlle difficulty in convict
ing him of one of the blackest crimes
ever committed in San Francisco.
WRIT ORDER DISMISSED.
Soeder gave his age as 3S years and
said he was a cook by occupation and
a native of France. After being booked
on the register Soeder was put into a
cell and kept there until he was taken
before Superior Judge Dunne on the
writ of habeas corpus secured by his
attorneys on Thursday. The proceedings
before Judge Dunne lasted but a few
minutes. Assisting Prosecuting Attor
ney Whiting appeared for Chief of Po
lice Wittman and filed a complaint and
warrant showing that Soeder was le
gally in custody on a charge of willful
murder.
Leon Soeder was formally charged
yesterday with the crime of having
willfully murdered his brother-in-law,
Joseph. Blaise, on last Sunday evening
at the foot of Russian Hill. The com
plaint charging Soeder with the murder
of Blaise was sworn to by Detective
Tom Gibson and presented to Police
Judge Cabaniss. After reading the
sworn complaint Judge Cabaniss issued
a warrant for the arrest of Soeder and
ordered that he be kept in custody
without ball.
After securing the warrant Detective
Gibson proceeded to the prison in the
Hall of Justice and read the warrant to
Soeder. who has been detained in cus
tody since last Monday by the police.
Soeder was visibly nervous when Gib
son read the warrant to him, but he
pulled himself together when taken be
fore the police desk in the prison to
be booked on the register.

J. W. Springer, the retiring president.
who has been an officer of the associa
tion for seven years, was presented with
a handsome 6ilver loving-cup in appre
ciation of his faithful services to the
association.
The delegates -were entertained to
night at a smoker given in the armory.
El Paso, Tex.; St. Joseph, Mo.: San
Jose, Ca!.; Detroit, Mich., and Denver,
Colo., extended invitations to the con
vention to meet in their respective
cities next year. Delegates from Den
ver and San Jose were on the floor and
urged their cause. A second ballot was
unanimous in favor of Denver.
The last day's session was crowded
with business. The election of officers
resulted in placing H. J. Hagenbarth
of Utah at the head of the association
as its chief executive; H. Jastro, Ba
kersfleld. Cal., first vice president:
Francis Stewart. Buffalo, S. D., second
vice president; Charles McMillan. Den
ver, Colo., secretary: George L. Gould
ing:. Denver, treasurer.
The public lands question was studied
thoroughly. The conditions in every
State v.ere reported by those who know
thÂ«Â»ir.. Policies believed to offer relief
to the stockmen were proposed and
discussed. The other side of the mat
ter and the Government's policy rela
tive to forest reserves were explained
by" President Roosevelt's appointed
representatives. Messrs. Pinchott and
Newell. In brief, the^ Government and
the stockmen got together to calmly
look into the situation and see what
can be done to relieve the objection
able conditions that confront the indus
try. The stockmen had the satisfaction
before the close of their convention of
hearing the promise from the Govern
ment's representatives that measures
would be proposed looking toward the
recognition of their asserted rights.
Resolutions were adopted expressing
the sentiment of the convention upon
several questions of national moment
now pending before Congress, and the
utockmen have reason to believe that
their wishes will have some weight.
ThÂ° railroads were handled severely
for their action relative to supplying
cars, transr>ortir.g cattle and charging
what to thÂ«> stockmen appear to be un
warranted tariffs.
The proposition of the stockmen to
hand together in a corporation for the
purpose of building and operating
packing plants of their own. that the
packing combinations may be fought
and the interests of the producer and
the consumer protected, were explained
thoroughly by those who have studied
the situation. The neceesity of rais
ing J5.000.000 for the purpose of put
ing this plan into operation was kept
before the convention, and the work
of securing subscriptions toward this
end will be taken up in each State im
mediately. The plan having received
the unanimous indorsement of the con
vention, those directing it are de
termined to carry it through to suc
cess, and no effort will be left undone
to accomplish this end. The expression
of th'Â»se who spoke in behalf of this
scheme wa? that it offered the only
solution of the situation that now
fares the industry and the sole means
of restoring prices to the producer.
From the opening session of the Na
tional Wool Growers' Convention to
the closing of the livestock men's or
ganization unity and harmony have
characterized every action. With this
feeling prevailing the work of the con
vention was easily accomplished.
Many important questions have been
considered, not from the stockmen's
standpoint alone, but from other points
of view. Of these questions most im
portant were the public lands relative
to grazing, the relation of railroads to
tbÂ«? stock industry, and, most im
portant of all, the establishment of
independent packing-houses. This has
been the watchword of almost every
eesrJon.
PORTLAND, Or.. Jan. 15.â With the
leelins that one of the most important
meetings in the history of the organiza
tion was ended and that much was ac
complished that will be for the future
success of the livestock business, the
seventh annual convention of the Na
tional Livestock Association adjourned
this afternoon to meet in Denver, Colo.,
next year. The unanimous opinion of
those in attendance upon this conven
tion is that a more successful and more
pleasant convention has never been
held. They feel that the Government
recognition of this meeting is an as
surance that the livestock association
has won for itself a place in the pub
lic eye to which few associations of
similar character can lay claim.

CHICAGO. Jan. 13.â The Coroner's
inquest to-day was given over to wit
nesses from the fire department, Chief
Musham and several of his highest
ranking assistants testifying.
Chief Musham declared that in his
opinion it was the duty of the building
commissioner to report to him that the
fire protection in the theater was in
adequate. No report had been made to
him and he had taken no action in the
matter. It had not been the custom of
the fire department to inspect theaters
for protection unless a report had been
made from the office of the building
commissioner. In this connection It
may be recalled that Building Commis
sioner Williams testified that it was not
the business of his office to report on
fire protection, but that it was a mat
ter entirely belonging to the fire depart
ment.
First Assistant Fire Marshal Cham
pion testified that two weeks before the
opening of the Iroquois Theater he
stepped into the^ building to examine
conditions. He explained to Fireman
Sailers of the Iroquois Theater that he
should. have a lot of pumps and hose
especially on the stage, particularly
cautioning him that a hose with the
city pressure would not answer and he
should get powerful pumps. He also
suggested a sprinkler system and Sai
lers replied that the company was go
ing to put in all the appliances neces
sary.
John Hannan. chief of the first bat
talion of the Chicago fire department,
testified that he went on the stage of
the theater during a performance a few
days previous to the fire. He came
away with the idea that the fire pro
tection was inadequate, but made no
report on the matter because he had
never considered that part of his busi
ness unless reports were called for.
Archibald Bernard, the electrician In
charge of the switchboard at the the
ater, reiterated the opinion he had pre
viously given on the stand, that the
fire was caused by scenery blowing
against unprotected carbons In the spot
lights.
Orders were issued by Commissioner
Williams to-day to close six more
churches for failure to comply with the
building ordinance.

for the crime and only surrendered
after he had been shot twice in the legs

Upturns Stolen Money.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. â The Sec
retary of the Treasury has received an
envelope postmarked San Francisco, a
conscience contribution of $100.
Medical science has fixed to a nicety
the hour that Joseph Blaise was foully
murdered on the dark side of Russian
Hill. The Call published exclusively
yesterday the findings of Autopsy Sur
geon Bacigalupi, that the unfortunate
German came to his death within an
hour after he had eaten his last supper.
This fact was firmly established by
an examination of the undigested food
that was removed from Blaise's stom
ach during the autopsy. Realizing that
that he had discovered one of the most
important pieces of evidence that has
â¢yet come to the notice of the police.
Dr. Bacigalupi immediately notified
Chief Wittman. The contents of the
stomach were not sent to be analyzed
until Thursday afternoon, when Dr. A.
C. Bothe, the new City Chemist, was
sworn into office.
Yesterday Bothe spent a great part
of the day in segregating the various
foods that were found in the dead
man's stomach. Several pieces of let
tuce, a number of Spanish beans and
a large quantity of meat and fat were
placed in separate bottles. This morn
ing Dr. Bothe will make some slide
specimens of the different foods and
examine them under the microscope.
When the chemist has completed this
phase of the investigation he will be
able to tell to within less than half an
hour just how long the food eaten by
Blaise was subject to the digesting
process of the various juices of the
stomach.
NO POISONS ARE FOUND.
The rest of the contents of the stom
ach were placed in solution and tested
for the presence of poisons. Dr. Lelanu,
the Coroner, knowing of the solution
of cyanide of potassium that Soeder
had In his possession, instructed Dr.
Bothe to make a special test for that
deadly drug. He made what is known
as the 'characteristic blue test, but
failed- to find any trace of the hydro
cyanic acid. The chemist also made
test for chloral hydrate, which is the
base of the common "knockout drop"
so commonly employed to render a
man unconscious. Solutions of am
monium silver nitrate added to the so
lution from the stomach, however, did
not show the presence of any of the
poisonous drug.
The absence of either of these deadly
poisons in the contents as proven by a
chemical test only snows again the
utter Improbability of any drug having
been administered to the murdered
man before he was killed. To-day Dr.
Bothe will make tests for all of the
most toxic poisons known.
The beans removed from the stomach
of Joseph Blaise show very little evi
dence of having been subjected to the
action of the digestive fluids. Some of
them had the appearance of never hav
ing been acted on at all. Now, when it
is considered that the ordinary bean is
digested In from three to four hours at
the utmost, the presence oÂ£ undigested
beans in the stomach of Blaise proves
the statement of Dr. Baclgalupi that
the unfortunate man came to his end
within an hour or less than an hour
after he had eaten. t
FOOD IS UNDIGESTED.
Dr. Bothe was loth to make a state- ,
ment as to the probable time of the
man's death, as shown by the condition
of. the stomach's contents, but said 1 that
when the beans which were found were
in such an undigested condition it was
only logical to believe that they had
been in .the stomach but a short time.
He said: &Â£ fjÂ£
â¢'Most of my examination will be
centered on* the meat, which'ta the food
most digested in the stomach, although
I shall make a thorough examination
of every substance I have been able t,o
segregate. The more evidence I obtain,
the more conclusive will bothe report
which I submit to the Coroner. The
beansâ classed as carbo-hydratesâ Â«are
digested In the small intestines and
generally do not remain in the stomach
very long under normal conditions. The
fact that they were found' In the stom
ach after the man's death shows that
they were not tnere long. I would not
like to make a close statement until
after I have finished my analysis."
The lettuce found in the stomach was
hardly affected at all, and another sub
stance resembling another vegetable
matter similar to that of celery was
also found, along with' considerable fat.
The contents -of Blaise's stomach
were of an unusually dark color. This
color is attributed by Dr. Bothe to a
regurgitatlon of chyle from the
small Intestines" into the stomach,
which sometimes occurs in case a per
son's body is twisted or doubled up.
The chemist will have his report ready
this morning:, and it will in all prob
ability be a complete verification of the
statements in regard to the hour of the
man's death already published.

The inquest on tJ\e body of Blaise has
not yet been set by Coroner 1 Leland,
who is awaiting the collection of evi
dence by the police.
Soeder will be arraigned In the court
of Judge Cabaniss this morning, but
the hearing will not be proceeded with
until the police are ready to present
all their evidence.

Soeder's wife died last February at
Petaluma under most suspicious cir
cumstances, and he collected $2000 on
her life insurance. He also admits
that he had a former wife, whose
maiden name was Elizabeth Nefs, but
claims she went to Germany and died
there. Soeder was married to Elizabeth
Nefs in San Francisco on September
18, 1888.
The police are now engaged in try
ing to locate Elizabeth Nefs, or to
trace her movements and find out
whether she is alive or dead. They are
also working with the Petaluma of

of Soeder's second wife will be ex

detect the poison in the' remains.

At a meeting of the Board of Fire
Commissioners yesterday afternoon
rules and regulations for firemen de
tailed to theaters were adopted. It is
the intention of Chief Sullivan to have
several copies of the rules posted in
the various places of amusement about
the city and to submit them to all
members of the department. that they
may be familiar with, them in the
event of emergency. It was also or
dered that firemen be ordered to re
port for duty at ten theaters which at
the present time are not covered. These
show houses are: Lyceum Theater,
Seventh and Market streets; Novelty
Theater, Ellis and Powell streets;
Cineograph Theater, 74 7 Market
street; Midway Theater, 771 Market

Washington street; Chinese Theater,
C23 Jackson street: Broadway Theater,
Broadway and Stockton street; Ma
rionette Theater. 404 f Broadway;
Unique Theater, 1132 Market street.
The following are the rules:
JuÂ«t as the joint committee of the Su
pervisors on Health and Finance that
has been Investigating' the actions of
the Health Board was on the point of
adjourning last night, Attorney Ruef
succeeded in securing* a further delay.
The prosecution, as the committee has
been termed, has finished its case, and
the defense will have an inning- Mon
day night.
The proceedings last night were, as
usual, enlivened by tiffs between Ruef
and Brandenstein, but few new facts
were elicited. Dr. Stlnson and Herbert
Schmitz, who were expected to give in
teresting testimony, failed to appear.
Dr. Curtis was the first witness
called. He testified as to having taken
the civil service examination on March
14, 1903, for sanitary Inspector. One
of the examiners was Dr. Ward, presi
dent of ? the present Board of Health,
who, at the time, seemed perfectly
satisfied with the form of examination.
The doctor then related in detail the
duties of a sanitary Inspector. Cross
examined by Mr. Ruef, the witness ad
mitted that he spent an hour and a
half each day In his office and also de
voted considerable time to visiting pri
vate patients.
.- DISCRIMINATION" AliLEGED.
Dr. d'Ancona called attention at
this point to the nature of the exam
ination held for sanitary inspectors.
This examination allowed two
"weights" for experience in medicine,
and Mr. Ruef took an objection to the
allowance of these "weights," stating
that civil service was violated, by such
allowance, inasmuch as experience in
medicine was required before the ex
amination could be taken. ' .". \~\*~<
Dr. Harvey was called and asked by
the chairman what advantage it was to
the city to abolish the civil service
sanitary inspectors and replace them
with non-civil service inspecting phy
sicians. In reply he stated he thought
it better, as it would leave the position
open only to men who could be drawn
upon at any time for professional
knowledge.
"Did you use your own mind in
abolishing the officers in the Health
Department?" was asked.
"In part," was the answer.
"Why did you create the office of
Deputy Health Officer?"
"I think we have a right to."
"What is the plan for the administra
tion of the City and County Hospital?"
"Similar to that in the city. One
man will be the head and certain of-,
flees will be consolidated. To do this it
seemed necessary to do away with civil
service employes."
THIS SAME OLD STORY.
Dr. Harvey stated like the former
witnesses that he first saw the resolu
tions regarding the aboiition of certain
offices in the Mayor's office on the
morning of January 9. All the mem
bers of the board and Mr. Ruef were
present. Dr. Harvey admitted having
presented certain resolutions, but did
not know whether he had originated
them or not. After diligent questioning
he finally remembered that Dr. Ward
had helped him prepare the resolutions.
Mr. Brandenstein then began a line of
questioning regarding the qualifications
of various appointees, beginning with
Dr. Ragan. When asked if it was the
same Ragan that had been on the Wal
ler-Burns-Ragan School Board objec
tion was made by Mr. Ruef and the
line of questioning proceeded. The wit
ness knew the majority of the new ap
pointees, but seemed to know very lit
tle regarding the deposed men. Under
the prompting of Mr. riuef the witness
refused to state in what manner the
discharged men he kne* â¢ were Incompe
tent. The witness had never received
any instructions from the Mayor nor
Mr. Ruef as to his duties or the ap
pointees.
Speaking of the non-civil service po
sitions, the doctor frankly admitted
that he would prefer to appoint the
men himself sooner than accept those
selected by others.
Mr. Brandenstein moved that the
matter be taken under advisement and
the meeting adjourned to the -all of
the chair. Mr. Ruef objected to this
proceeding, stating lhat he wished to
put witnesses on the stand. He refused
to state who his witnesses "were or to
what they rtflght testify, â¢ but finally
carried his point and an adjournment
was taken until Monday evening at S
o clocU. when, it Is expected, the hear,
inj V.-11I be concluded.
.The review of the troops at the Pre
sidio yesterday was carried on under
adverse^ circumstances. The. day was
cold, and a dense fog settled over the
golf links. The grass on the parade
ground was wet,, which did away with
any" movements faster than walking.
The different commands were on the
spot promptly at 10 a.. m. in full-dres3
uniform. As they- came up the hill
they presented a fine appearance when
passing, a given point, but could not
be seen far. The following commands
took part Jn.t+ie exercises: â¢
Tenths Infantry^ Colonel Charles H.
Noble; JWnth Cavalry. Major John
Bigelow Jr., and Field Artillery Corps,
Colonei Charles
At the conclusion ,of the review by
Colonel Morris,- in company with
Colonel Noble he went through the for
mal inspection of the different com
panies.
The general maneuvers were cut out,
as it would have been impossible to
have conducted them satisfactorilyl
The cavalry, however, was put around
tile links under a slow trot, but was
not allowed to break into a gallop on
account* of the slippery condition of
the field. The review was concluded by
11 o'clock.
On next Wednesday at 10 a. m. an
other review and inspection will take
place before Genial MacArthur. in
which all the troops stationed about
the bay. including the Twenty-eighth
Infantry,, just home from the Philip
pines, will take part:
The grand review before the, new
Secretary of War will probably take
place on Saturday afternoon, January
23, If the Korea, which is due that day,
comes 'in on time.

Mrs. CIiittenden,Says That Her
Husband Drinks to Excess
and Then He Abases Her
"In visiting a night school recently I
sjw a boy who was fast asleep, with
his head buried in his arms on the desk.
The teacher informed me that the boy
was a match peddler and was com
pletely exhausted with his day's work,
and she mercifully allowed him to
sleep. That boy should be in school in
the day and asleen-at night.
"I propose to enlist the aid. of the
Police Department in this matter, and
will hale the parents of these children
before Judge Murasky under the provi
sions of the compulsory education law.
The fact that the- bors must bring
home a stated amount each day is put
ting a premium on crime, as it is self
evident that they will procure the
amount in some way rather than be
flogged. It Is the fathers of the boys
against whom we will proceed, and in
teresting developments may be looked
for. As soon as the truant officer* have
rounded up most of thÂ» offenders I will
urge the court to provide the remedy
under the law."
Roncovieri is determined to enforce
the compulsory education law in the
< ase of these children, of whom there
are a large number in this city. He in
structed Officers Merchant and Floyd
to continue their efforts in securing the
names of all children who peddle dur
ing the day. After they have all been
rounded up it is Roncovieri's intention
to summon their parents to Judge Mu
rasky's court, where a Judicial investi
gation will be instituted in order to
compel the sending of the children to
pome day school in compliance with the
compulsory law. Roncovieri thinks that
some of the boys who said they were 14
years of age are not as old as they say,
and in that event they would be barred
from attending night school, as the age
limit is fourteen years.
"From the investigations conducted
by the truant officers," said Roncovieri
in discussing the matter, "I am of the
opinion that right here in San Fran
cisco we have a system that has all the
earmarks of the padrone system in
Italy, which is in effect a modified form
of slavery. I propose to wage a relent
less crusade against the system if It
does exist, and to that end will use my
V>est endeavors to compel the parents
of these Sicilian children to comply
with the compulsory -education law by
sending them to school.
NOT REAL PARENTS.
â¢ "I firmly believe that in many cases
the alleged parents of the children se
cured them from their real parents,
who are prot>alÂ»!y peasants in Italy, on
representations that the boys would be
ccrr.e great men in America. To in
stance the disgraceful conditions un
der which these boys exist, I recall an
incident when I discovered two of them
who had been asleep under my doorstep
one mcrnlngr at 1 o'clock. I questioned
them, and they told me they had not
sold the amount exacted by their father
and they had derided not to go home
until their father was asleep. The boys
overslept themselves in so doing, but
said they would escape a severe beat
ing with the aid of their mother,* who
would admit them to the house and
then send them off to peddle again 'in
the morning before the father awak
ened. The fathers of some of these boys
are idle and spend the latters* earnings
In gambling. It is a terrible state of af
fairs and demands the instant atten
tion of the municipal authorities. - â¢Â¦' -
Acting under directions of President
lloncovleri, Truant Officers Floyd and
Merchant have been rounding up a
number of Sicilian children of school
age, most of whom peddle matches and
lemons during the day. Upon being
brought to the office of the Board of.
Education and closely questioned the
boys invariably admitted that they
nere s^irf out in the morning to peddle
thfir wares and were given orders by
their r>arÂ«-nt* not to return home until
they had sold at least $1 worth of
matches under penalty of receiving a
seven- heating.
Director Iloncovieri is of the opinion
that the boys have been coached in
their' replies, for they generally an
swered that they are 14 years of age
and attend night school, though in
most instances they were unable to
K'.ve the name of the night school.
Seme explained in a roundabout way
that they went to the Washington
evening school, near which they live,
but it developed that they had not re
newed their attendance since the begin
ning of the new term.
WILL KNFOIICE LAW.
School Director Roncovieri, president
of the Board of Education, in institut
ing plans to out the compulsory educa
tion law into effect has uncovered what
he has reason to believe to be a full
fledged padrone system, which it is hi3
earnest intentiun to break up if pos
sible.
Ruef was corroborated by Commis
sioner Rogers that the * old jj Health
Board" had created new positions such
as -cigar inspector without first con
sulting* the Civil Service^ Commission.
Ruef, in reply to Slack, said that it In
tended to ask the Civil Service Com
mission for certification for its new offi
cers, but Slack said there was no.rec
ord of It in the board's minutes. Rog
ers said that if it was found that the
rule had been evaded in the rearrange
ment of positions his commission would
insist/on civil service employes being
restored. '
Bahrs then stated that the protest
against the right of the Health Board
to make a reclassification ...without* first
applying to the Civil Service Commis
sion would be provisionally overruled
in order to hear evidence on other
branches of the investigation. '; Slack
objected, hut, Bahrs stated that the
ruling, was not to : be regarded sCa final
and might be changed before the end
of the inauiry.
Judge Slack then ; took ; up the ques
tion of the. removal of E. J. Coffey, sta
tistician, claiming that Coffey, accord
ing to" the rules, should have been- re*
tained instead of P. R. Hennessy, who
8toodlower on the list of .experienced
clerks, although they-; were 'both "'ap
pointed on the same day. Arguments
on the point were mado by Ruef and
Sladk,*and. the : inquiry was then, ad
journed until next Monday at 2 p. m. . ..
"There have been no classifications
made of the positions of statistician
and assistant secretary,*' said Ruef,
"and no examinations were held for
them, though ; the positions were filled
from other eligible lists by the old
board. The Civil Service Commission
classifies offices that exist or are cre
ated, and then examinations are held
for the same. The deputy health offi
cer has a right to hold his position
until a civil service examination is held
for it. The" Health Board wants civil
service, but not trie kind that means
the perpetual draining of the city treas T
ury with no. adequate, service for the,
same. All these barnacles' of the
Health Department who were ordered
removed are ready to do everything
to remain .fastened on the ship of city
government." .
Lane said that under' Ruef's."conten
tion the Health Board was free to cre
ate positions without number whenever
they wished, and , thus make/a farce
of civil service. ' Bahrs suggested a
middle . course that the departments
knowing their own necessities could ap
point new employes and after investi
gation the Civil Service Commission
could then- arrange- for their Â¦ formal
classification. f :
COMMISSION* NOT CONSULTED.
Lane argued that the Health Board
had exceeded its authority in reclas-
Bifying certain created positions after
abolishing old ones, claiming that the
charter places such power in the
hands of r the Civil' Service Commis
sion alone. Ruef argued to the con
trary "and Judge Slack contended that
the Health Board had no right to
make an independent classification to
that already made by the Civil Ser
vice Commission.. Lane said that civ
il service employes are not dismissible
at the caprice of department heads.
Ruef quoted the charter showing
that the Health Board, has power to
create new positions, but must subse
quently report its action to the Civil
Service Commission, which will there
upon make a new classification of po
sitions to which new/ duties had been
added.
: The Health Board was represented
by Dr. Janies Â¦ W. Ward, . president;
Health Officer Ragan and Abe Ruef,
the- board's attorney. Charles . W.
Slack and .Franklin K. Lane were'
present as attorneys, for the employes
who were removed and the Civil Ser
vice Employes' Association.
Rogers stated that the Health Board
had complied with the civil service
rules in -restoring several food inspec
tors who were removed though they
stood higher up on the eligible list
than others who were retained. Ruef
stated that the board had restored the
food inspectors notwithstanding that
they were considered to be less ef
ficient than the others who had to
give way to them. Ruef said that the
decree of the Civil Service Commission
that two milk inspectors be appointed
from the food inspectors' list was not
in accord with the Health Board's
views, but it desired to evince its in
tention to Comply with the civil ser
vice law by obeying the decree.
â¢ EXCEEDED AUTHORITY.
The grounds of protest are that the
removals were in violation of rules
20 and 24 of the commission, and that
the action of the Health Board is con
trary to section \ 1 2, article 1 3 of the
charter of the city and county, sub
versant of the principles of civil ser
vice, illegal and' void." ' . - -â¢.-"'
The Civil Service Commission met
yesterday; to consideY the protests of
-various civil service employes who
were removed from .their positions by
the new Health* Board. The three
members of the commission â Presi
dent. Bahrs,. Rogers and Williamsâ

quiry. The employes who protested

SEATTLE. Wash., Jan. 15. â Ex-
Mayor J. T. Ronald and ex- Judge G.
Meade Emory, both prominent attor
neys, fought in the corridors of the
King County Courthouse this morning.
Had not friends interfered the battle
might have had a serious termination.
As it was, each attorney got several
stiff punches in the head. Both men
wear eyeglasses, and at the first blow
struck by each their glasses were scat
tered on the tiled floor.
The trouble grew out of an argument
before Judge Bell this morning. Ronald
Is the attorney for William Jensen of
the Bismarck Cafe, and Emory repre
sents the Seattle Brewing and Malting
Company, which is engaged in litiga
tion with the Bismarck.
Recently Judge Bell enjoined the
Bismarck Cafe from selling any other
domestic beer but Rainier, the product
of the Seattle Brewing and Malting
Company. Ronald sought to have the
order modified to-day, so that Jensen
might dispose of the other beer that he
had on hand. In the argument Ronald
accused Emory of bad faith, alleging
that in a private conversation Emoi^
agfeed to allow ; a modified ' order, but
that jwhen it came into court he op
posed it. Emory- denied that he had
agreed to any such thing.' Judge Bell
said that his original order Would
stand.

TACOMA. Wash., Jan. 15. â Watson,
the steward of the Clallam, who is In

wishes the people who are criticizing
Captain Roberts could have under
stood the situation from the stand
point of an eye witness. He said if
the attempt had not been made to
save the women and children in the
boats it would have resulted in every
body being lost. It would have been
impossible for the women and children
to climb the hurricane deck when the
steamer listed, yet if they had been on
deck the men would have had to re
main below and give the women and
children the upper deck. All could
not go up and it meant the men stay
ing below. The trial of the lifeboats
was the only recourse.
Superintendent Heath, who built
the steamer Clallam. said to-day:
"There was never a stancher or
more seaworthy vessel on the sound
than the Clallam, and I know Captain
Roberts did all in his power to save
the vessel. The Clallam's life-saving
apparatus was of the best and was In
perfect condition."

NEW YORK, Jan. 15.â R. G. Dun &
Co.'s weekly review of trade to-mor
row will say: T 4 Vr- ;vV
Reports of improvement in the vol
ume of business outnumber unfavor
able dispatches, although the situation
is decidedly irregular. As the money
market becomes easier there is bettrr
prospect of postponed work being re
sumed. All structural lines are largely
dependent upon the ability of the rail
roads to borrow money and the resto
ration of confidence among investors.
Only fair reports are received regard
ing the leading manufacturing lined.
Many Iron and steel plants have re
sumed, but the prevailing curtailment
is very severe. Textile fabrics are as
badly unsettled Â«s ever, lower prices
for new lines of woolens proving a dtj
agreeable surprise to the many small
traders. Distribution of merchandise
increases with more normal weather,
and clearing-houses report liberal or
ders for spring goods from sales
men at the West and South. Only
a moderate improvement has appeared
thus far in the demand for iron and
steel products, although the resumption
of Idle plants has attained encouraging
proportions. Hides are more active and
prices firmly maintained, with some
advances, especially In foreign dried
hides.

mainspring of the upward swing in'

the advance in raw textiles, helped to

staple products to close the highest for

gives an appearance of activity to mid
winter operations. The industrial sit
uation shows improvement, particular
ly in iron and steel mill resumptions
and in the putting into blast of more
coke furnaces. Little or no friction
seems to attend numerous wage reduc
tions scheduled for the current month
and, though weather conditions are a
bar to activity in outside work, an ac
tive spring trade is looked for in this
line.

Special Dispatch to The Call
WASHINGTON. Jan. 15.â The Presi
dent to-day submitted to Congress a
message explicitly recommending the
purchase of the sequoia groves of big
trees In California, to be incorporated
in a national park. This will definitely
determine the proposition that has
been before Congress for some years.
The sequoia groves in Calaveras
County cover 3200 acres. They are
owned by Robert Whiteside, residing
in Duluth. 'He has heretofore offered
them to the Government for $loO,000.
A bill introduced by Senator Perkins
recently provides for their purchase for
a sum r.ot to exceed 5200.000, provide J ,
ihe deal is effected within sixty days
after the passage of the bill, which is
now before a committee. In the event
of a deal not being effected within that
time the bill provides for the condem
nation of the property for park pur
poses, valuation to be made by prop
erly constituted authorities.
The sequoia groves were taken up
originally under the homestead act and
were offered by th; original locator to
the Government tpr, $100,000 and sub
sequently purchased from him by
Whiteside, a lumber man. He offered
the property to the Government when
the park proposition was first men
tioned at $4 a thousand feet of the
standing timber, the land to be donated.
The Secretary of the Interior rejected
the offer. Whiteside Is on his way to
Washington in regard to the matter.
It is understood that he declines $200,
000 now.
The junta message to the convention
begins by reviewing the history of the
independence movement and its causes.
The junta formally resigns the legisla
tive powers to the convention and lays
before It an account of its acts, giv
ing the reasons therefor. It says that
the revenues of the republic are in
sufficient, because the commercial tax
has considerably diminished on account
of the anticipation of the changes
which the ratification of the canal
treaty would affect In the customs sys
tem. The republic only floated two
loans in New York, which were of
$100,000 each.
The junta formally informs the con
vention of the ratification of the canal
treaty, and said it had powerful rea
sons for such ratification, which when
they were communicated to the ; con
vention will show them to be fully
justified. The message goes on to say
that the benefits to be derived from
this treaty are incalculable and that
a seed has been sown which will grow
into a tree of the greatest benefit to

the high aspirations of the people.
PANAMA, Jan. 15.â Members of the
junta and some consular â¢ representa
tives were present to-day at the first
session of the constitutional conven
tion, which was also attended by a
great crowd of' people.
Dr. Pablo Arosemena, temporary
president of the convention, delivered
the opening address, which was fre
quently interrupted by enthusiastic ap
plause. Dr. Arbsemena said:
'â¢The republic^ will live less by its
material power than by the virtues it
will practice. Independence must be
maintained and the republic must
adopt without reserve that policy of
probity which Is born of justice and
knowledge."
Dr. Arosemena reviewed the favor
able auspices under which the repub
lic has been born and paid:
. "Its security is protected by a pow
erful people In whose veins runs the
rich blood of those Puritans who shook
oflfth,e dust of their sandals the tor
ment of religious interference and the
opprobium of political despotism."
â¢Dr. Arosemena concluded by recom
mending that in the exercise of their
duties the members of the convention
should keep their country in their
hearts and their minds.
Chancellor von Bulow being absent.
Under Secretary of State Nieberg an
swered the interpellation, the substance
of his remarks being that the Chancel
lor had already taken the initiative In
the matter and had instructed the
commission engaged ' in revising the
penal procedure to take the question
under consideration. However, the Un
der Secretary said, the Government
would not consent to the absolute abo
lition of the compulsory process. *
Other speakers of various j parties
identified themselves with the purpose,
of the interpellation.
BERLIN, Jan.. 15.â In the Reichstag
to-day the. National Liberals interpel
lated Count von Bulow, the Imperial
Chancellor, as to .why he had not yet
introduced a bill abolishing the system
of compulsory testimony of editors and
publishers o.f newspapers for the pur
pose pi ascertaining' the authorship ol
incriminating evidence. Herr Jenicke,
National Liberal, explained the inter
pellation. Few questions, he said, have
been longer before the Reichstag. This
'matter of abolishing the procedure by
which editors and publishers are com
pelled to testify was first discussed
thirty years ago. He pointed out that
this compulsory process neoessarlly
lowers the moral tone of the news
papers and gives editors a second-rate
i standing in the community. Herr Jen
icke referred tj the curious fact that
in Germany it is not yet regarded as
quite dignified to write for newspapers.
The speaker compared the higher tone
of the English press with the tone of
the press of Germany, and explained
that the 'former was due to the;- fact
that England had been longer under a
constitutional government and that the
English press had more traditions, in
cluding complete freedom. If Germany
had a similar constitutional system, he
said, the discussion of to-day would be
unnecessary. Hjerr Jenicke referred to
the case of Editor Hildebrandt of the
Weekly Hilfe, who refused to divulge
the name of a writer and was sen
tenced to eight weeks' imprisonment
and to pay a fine of 100 marks. He also
referred to the case of the Leipsic
Volkszeitung, in which the Judges ex
amined an old woman who carried the
papers to subscribers, and also the
compositors and an apprentice, in order
to ascertain the names of the writers
of certain articles. Herr Jenicke called
upon the Government to return to the
standpoint of Frederick the Great, that
"the gazettes must not be disturbed."

The tug Albion to-day discovered two
more bodies of victims of the Clallam
disaster. The remains of John Byers
were picked up off Brotchie ledge, and
those of R. Campbell of 905 Twentieth
avenue, Seattle, off Albert Head.
Griffiths was the last living man on
board. TVhen the water came up to him
*he clung to the* steamer's side and
climbed up the stays to the masthead,
and from there watched all the men on
the side washed off. He watched the
stay carried away and he was then
thrown into the sea. He was picked up
from the floating pilot-house by the
Holyoke. The passengers and crew had
nil asked, the captain and mate to put
them on the Holyoke when the tug
came up. ,.. .
Griffiths gave a clear statement of
the happenings in connection with the
disaster. He said Captain Roberts was
much excited, and told of a conversa
tion when the boats were being lowered
when Captain Roberts had told witness
that he (the witness) would be drowned.
Witness replied that if he was he would
not be the only one.
Griffiths said he had no hope that the
boats would live, and advised people
not to go in them. He said no steps
were taken to rescue those in the water
after the first boat had capsized, though
they were alongside the steamer. There
were no rockets or blueflres or other
signals on board as far as he knew.
The rudder was known not to be in
good condition, and the steamer would
not steer well.
Griffiths said he had thought of cut
ting the line when the tug Holyoke was
towing, as the steamer was foundering.
He had not been ordered to do so. He
had been told that the captain could
shoot any one not obeying orders in
such a time, and did not carry out his
intention. He told of clambering over
the steamer's side when she turned
over at the last minute.
Evidence was given this morning by
Richard Griffiths, one of the crew of
the Clallam, that one -of the seamen
took the ensign from its box and was
hauling it to half-mast upside down
when Captain Roberts ordered him to
take it down and put it right side up,
as if nothing had occurred. About that
time a steamer, which witness took to
be a collier, passed them about three
miles away. Captain Roberts saw that
he was wrong, and about ten minutes
later allowed the sailor to put the flag
in a reversed position.
VICTORIA, B. C. Jan. 15.âApplica
tion was made to-day at the Coroner's
inquest into the Clallam disaster for
warrants for the arrest of Captain Rob
erts and others, who are held responsi
ble for the wreck, on a charge of man
slaughter. C. H. Lurgin, representing
the Dominion Government, to-day said
that sufficient evidence had vbeen se
cured to show criminal -negligence, and
he would apply to the provincial gov
ernment on behalf of the Dominion
Government seeking the arrest of the
captain and any others held to be re
sponsible.

DECLINES TO GIA T E
CAUSE OF THE ARREST
Edward- Mackenzie was convicted
yesterday by Judge Mogan of disturb
ing the peace. He entered the Epworth
lodging-house, at 1037 Market street,
early one morning a few days ago â¢ and
while one of the lodgers had gone up
stairs for a moment popped' into the
room and locked the door. He refused
to be dislodged until a policeman had
been sent for. He is also accused of
having retained $3 50 from collections
he made for the Christmas dinner given
by the Salvation Army. He will be sen
tenced to-day after his record has been
looked into a little further.
Police Judge Mogan has locked horns
with the republic of France over a
murder charge now pending in his
court. On January 12 last Vincent Le
Carvec, a sailor on the French ship
Vercingetorix, . which was moored at
the Valle jo-street wharf, ran a keen
knife into a shipmate named Vincent
Le Meur. The injured' man passed
away at the City and County Hospital
the following morning.
Le Carvec was arrested on the charge
of murder and has been in the custody
of the local police ever since. Yester
day he was given a preliminary hear
ing before Judge Mogan.' . Jean Le Gal,
first officer of the ship, and a number
of sailors testified, clearly establishing
the guilt of the accused. 1
The French Consul has entered a pro
test against any further proceedings
being taken against the accused man
by the local authorities. Yesterday he
sent to Chief of Police Wittman a letter
demanding the custody of the accused.
The demand is based on the provisions
of the treaty existing between the
United States and France giving all
ships of either nation territorial rights
even when in a port of the other na
tion. Accordingly the Consul claims
jurisdiction over the accused* man and
desires that he may be turned over
to him in order that the trial of the
charge may be held In a French court;
Judge Mogan submitted the letter to
District Attorney Byington, who was
too busy to render an 1 ' opinion on the
matter yesterday. It is claimed by
most of the attorneys that the demand
of the French* Consul is well based
and\that eventually Carvec will be
given into his custody. The defendant
is a low browed and repulsive looking
saiior and the French nation is thor
oughly welcome to him.
Judge Co-nlan overruled the constitu
tion yesterday and generally misuÂ«ed
cherished rights and privileges. It was
in the case of Maud Smith, charged
with vagrancy. Her attorney asked for
a continuance. "You can't have one,"
said the Judge. "I don't purpose to
use- up public time and bother citizens
for the disposal of a case like this."
"But, your Honor," protested the at
torney, "we are entitled to a contin
uance under the constitution."
"The constitution -is overruled," said
the Judge.
"Then I demand a trial by jury,"
said the attorney.
"You can't have that, either. The
constitution is overruled for a second
time. I'll find this woman guilty as
charged and will sentence her to-mor
row. Try the SUDreme Court the next
time if you don't like the brand of
Justice we dispense here."

iel Bigelo'w, James Taggart, Louis
Steckler and Frank Harris were booked
yesterday for various crimes at the
City Prison. Taggart is 24 years of
age, Steckler 18 and the others 16. The
arrests were made by vDetectlves Re
gan, O'Connell, Bunner and Freel.
On Christmas eve it is alleged that
Taggart, Steckler and Hogan went to
322 Ritch street and had trouble about
a girl they wanted to see. They were
thrown out by James Niddarson, one of
the roomers, and while Niddarson was
.standing on the sidewalk one of the
trio, it is alleged, fired a shot at him,
the bullet hitting him on the shoulder.
Niddarson ran into the house and a
shot was fired through the door, the
bullet striking the hall lamp and
breaking it into pieces.
The landlady, Mrs. Middlar, who is
76 years of age.'^vvent into the hallway
and while she was sweeping up the
broken glass three more shots were
fired through the door, each bullet
striking her on the side. She was
taken to St. Luke's Hospital and is
stiil there, but is recovering. Taggart,
Steckler and Hogan are charged with
assault to murder.
Hogan and Miles have each three
charges of burglary against them and
Bigelow two charges. The three are
accused of breaking into McNear's
warehouse on Berry street, between
Sixth and Seventh, on the night of Jan
uary 7 and stealing an elevator wheel
and a quantity of lead. They are also
accused of entering on the same night
the stable of Campbell Bros., on Second
street and South Park, and stealing a
ton of pig iron. Hogan and 'Miles are
accused of entering the warehouse at
176 Townsend street on the night of
January 12 and stealing twenty-four
pigs of lead valued at $125. It is
claimed that they hired a horse and
wagon to carry away their plunder,
which they sold to a junk dealer, from
whom all the stolen property has been
recovered. Harris, who is charged
with petty larceny, is accused of steaj
ing a mandolin last Wednesday from
the warehouse of Bekin & Co., Eighth
and Tehama streets. The instrument
has been recovered.
Hogan and Miles were arrested last
week on a charge of assault to rob.
Hogan was sent to the Juvenile Court
and the case against Miles was dis
missed for lack of prosecution. They
knocked down and attempted to rob a
sailor.
They all belong to the same gang and
are looked upon by the police as dan
gerous young criminals.
Mrs. Victoria Ferslow, who put her
two-year-old grandson on a hot stove
and seriously burned him as a matter
of discipline, was sentenced to I five
months in the County Jail by Judge
Cabaniss yesterday. In passing the
sentence the Judge said: "Ordinarily
I am opposed to inflicting such a severe
sentence on a-wo-man who is generally
law abiding and of previous good char
acter, but your action was one of such
inconceivable cruelty and so thorough
ly unwarranted that I have no com
punction in sending you to the County
Jail for a period of five months."
MOTHER ACCUSED OF
MURDER OF DAUGHTER
Witness Gives Damaging Testimony
Against the Defendant at
the Trial. Â»
ALLEXTOWN', Pa.. Jan. 15. â In the
trial to-day of Mrs. Catherine Be<*h
tel as an accessory after the fact to
the murder of her daughter, Mabel,
Mrs. Margaret Miller, under cross-ex
amination, testified that she observed
blood spots on the sidewalk directly
in front of the Bechtel home and also
saw tracks made by carriage wheels in
the rear of the Bechtel house after
Mabel's body was found. The witness
said that it was a fact that Tom Bech
tel, one of the defendants, did not talk
to Mabel and that he hardly spoke to
any member of the family. She said
that Mabel controlled her mother and
did as she pleased; that they had
quarreled and that Mabel had sworn
at her mother.
It is the festal season for the Greeks.
According to their calendar, they are
in the middle of their Christmas and
New Year celebrations, and for that
reason they are Indulging more than
usual in gaming and kindred amuse
ments. They have a game called "pan
gingi," fascinating in the extreme and
sufficiently lively to cause the inter
change of large-sums of money.
Thursday night a party of grave
Athenians gathered in the rear of a
restaurant on Howard street and com
menced to woo fortune. Three stealthy
police officers invaded the premises and
captured seven of the gamesters. One
man plunged through a window; thirty
feet from the ground, carrying the sash
with him, and escaped. The captured,
men appeared before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday, but were dismissed. The
prosecution was unable to establish the
fact that "pangingl" was a percentage
or banking game and the case fell.

The prosecution closed its case
against Martha E. Bowers, charged
with the murder of her husband, Mar
tin L. Bowers, before a jury in Judge
Cooks court yesterday. A hypothetical
question, based upon the symptoms
shown by the deceased, was put to Drs.
W. J. Hawkins. T. B. W. Leland and C.
L. Morgan, and they each answered
that death was caused by arsenical
poisoning:. In cross-examination they
admitted that although four grains of
arsenic were found in the stomach un
less it had been absorbed into the sys
tem it would not cause death. They
also admitted that some of the symp
toms could be caused by ptomaine poi
son. Chief Wittman was recalled and
testified that the defendant admitted
that Patrick Lervy stayed at her
house the night before her husband
died and the night after his death. This
closed the case for the prosecution.
DEFENSE IS CALLED.
Attorney Frank J. Drury made a
motion to strike out the evidence of J.
C. Peterson, the drug clerk at Fifth
and Folsom streets, who filled the pre
scription signed "McLaughlin, M. D.,"
calling for arsenic, but the Judge de
nied it.
Miss Mamif Montgomery, aliss Annie
Atchison and Mrs. E. H. Bailey, nurses
at the Waldeck Sanatorium, testified to
having se^n the defendant at her hus
band's bedside there every day and
that 5h*> seemed to treat him affection
ately and kindly.
Dr. Louis I. Breitstein of the Ger
man Hospital testified that while in the
ambulance with Bowers the way to
the hospital on the morning cf the day
on which he died Bowers had said that
his sickness was caused by eating some
ham about eleven weeks J revious and
that his wife, who had also eaten the
ham, had been sick for two day?. Wit
ners said he found the patient's lungs
in a bad condition.
John Cunningham testified that he
hsd seen Bowers every day during his
sickness and that Bowers had com
plained of his treatment at the Waldcck
and wanted to be taken home. Cun
ningham went with him to the Waldeck
in a hack and Bowery was able to walk
to the hack, but he was taken home
from the Waldeck on a stretcher. Bow
ers got worse after August 14.
MRS. SrTTON'S DENIAL.
Mrs. Zylphia Sutton. the defendant's
sister, testified that she did not present
the prescription signed "M'cLaughlin.
M. D.." at the drug store at Fifth and
Fclsom streets, but said she had called
there one day for a prescription which
Dr. McLaughlin had verbally ordered.
She heard Mrs. Sadie Bowers tell the
defendant that she had better order a
black dress, as her husband would
never set out of bed.
Charles Cornberger testified that h(*
was with Mrs. Sutton .when she called
at the drug store and got the medicine
which Dr. McLaughlin had ordered.
Detective T. J. Coleman brought into
court a basketful of letters found at the
residence of the defendant and they
weie marked for identification.
DEFENDANT TESTIFIES.
The defendant was called to the
Ktand. She gave her evidence quietly
and without displaying any nervous
ness. She detailed how her husband
became sick on June 1 from eating ham
at breakfast and her own sickness from
the same cause. She called in four dif
ferent doctors to attend her husband
and he was sent to the Waldeck at her
suggestion. She visited her husband
â¢there every day and after being there
three weeks he begged to be taken
back home, but Dr. McLaughlln ad
vised her to allow him to remain for
another week. He had been abl<*:to be
around before going, to the Waldeck.
but had to be brought, home on a
stretcher.
She contradicted Harry Bowers and
his wife by saying that they were sent
for on August 16. She declared they
were sent for on August 7. She also
denied that she had ever asked Harry
or his wife to give her husband medi
cine. Harry sat up all of the last night
her husband was alive with him, and
his wife had told her next morning
that she had got up during the night
and helped Harry to take care of Mar.
tin. Harry's wife had got prescrip
tions filled at her request at the drug
store at Fifth and Folsom streets. Her
examination was not concluded, pourt
adjourned till Monday morning.
A pathetic scene, was enacted in Judge
Fritz's court yesterday. George E. Wiel
er is A young man who is dying from
pulmonary tuberculosis. A month ago
he was arrested on a charge of grand
larceny and has been in the City Pris
on ever since. He was ill and unabl? to
work, with a wife and baby on his
hands, and wanted to go to Los An
geles", where he hoped to grow stronger.
He borrowed from D. E. Parry $100 on
some furniture "he owned and leftihe
city, taking the furniture with. nlm. He
was brought back, and the conflnement
he has undergone has practically ended
any hone he might have had for im
provement. , v.v-.
Judge Fritz called him up yesterday
and told him he was going -to allow
him liberty on his own recognizance
until the hearing of his .case next
Tuesday. The poor fellow was so over
come with excitement and Joy. that he
fell over into a. faint, and it was sev
eral minutes before he could be re
stored to. consciousness. Death atu.
pears very close, to him, and it is
doubtful if he will survive the hearing
of the Charge against .him.
Edward Richards appeared; before
Judge ' Mogan yesterday . to answer to
the charge of killing Joseph Martini, a
Pacific, street saloon-keeper; . ten "days
ago. \After he was arraigned it was
.discovered that the complaint was J de

Had Oppenheimer succeeded in over
powering Merritt he would no doubt
have endeavored to release the other
convicts confined in the Incorrigible
cells. All are desperate men, and it is
hard to judge what the result would
have been.
. Oppenheimer was transferred from
Folsom prison to San Quentin a few
years ago after murdering a fellow con
vict at that place. He received a life
sentence,, and no sooner had he crossed
the threshold of San Quentin prison
that he began to show his desperate
tiature. One morning while working In
the jute mill he became displeased with
an order given by a guard named
James McDonald. He lay in wait for
the guard and stabbed his victim seven
times with a large dirk knife. McDon
ald recovered from his wounds a'nd the
prison directors ordered Oppenheimer
confined in the incorrigible cells for the
rest of his life. This punishment did
not stop the desperate fellow, for sev
eral times he has assaulted guards. A
few. days ago he secured a piece of
paper and made a fire in his cell.-.
, .SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 15.-^Convict Ja
â¢ cob; Oppenheimer, -the terror of the Cal
Â¦ifornia^State prison, made another as
sault upon a .guard -at:' San Quentin
prison' late Thursday night, and as a
result he is still in a dazed condition
from' a wound on his head which re
quired fifteen stitches totlose.
, Each day the convicts who occupy
cells in the incorrigible row are taken
out one at' a time and exercised. As
usual this procedure was gone through
with Thursday night. Nothing unusual
occurred: until Ben Merrltt, one of the
guards, ; unlocked , the cell of Oppen
heimer. The convict was standing In
the rear of his narrow cell and with a
'wild -rush pounced upon ' Merrltt. He
caught the guard with hands about the
throat and choked him. Merrltt's supe
rior strength was quickly brought to
bear, andhe^threw the desperate con
vict back with such force that Oppen
heimer's head hit the edge of the large
Iron "door of the cell.' Oppenheimer fell
to the floor in an unconscious condition^
and_was hurriedly put back into his
cell~for~ fear he might be shamming.
The prison physician was then sum
moned,, and' upon examination found a
Wound reaching from the forehead to
the back of Oppenhejmer's skull. The
wound was Btitched up and Oppen
heimer was -left in his four by eight
cell.

There "was no objection, Mayor Ol

Commissioners Turner and. McEl

OAKLAND. Jan. 15.â Rev. Father
Powers of Livermore was appointed
guardian to-day of Lillian and Norma
Hill, the children of Mrs. Lena Hill,
the woman tramp, arrested for ma
licious mischief .at Livermore and now
serving a thirty days' sentence in the
County Jail. They will be sent to St.
Joseph's Home in San Francisco.
While the hearing of the case was
in progress Mrs. Agnes B. Sheppard
made a protest against the appoint
ment of Father Powers on the ground
that she had sent her two children to
St. Joseph's Home and they had be
come covered with sores. From the
testimony only her two children were
affected that way and the Judge stated
that he saw no reason for taking no
tice of the fact. Father Powers was
appointed forthwith and his bond fixed

OAKLAND, Jan. 15. â The tunnel
road between Oakland and Walnut
Creek has proved a big success from
the point of view of the residents of
the San Ramon Valley side of the Con
tra Costa hills and is in first-class con
dition. This Is the information that
was brought to Oakland to-day by W.
A. Rogers of Walnut Creek, who was
one of the principal advocates of the
tunnel road from the Contra Costa
side of the hills.
"The tunnel road has proved very
popular." said Mr. Rogers. "The peo
ple of the San Ramon Valley consider
it a great advantage, for it gives them
ns easy grade through to Oakland. We
have b<Â»en fighting for this for years
arid it brings us into closer and bet
ter communication with the bay. It
not only gives an outlet for the pro
ducts of the center of Contra Costa
County, but we believe that next year
it will bring us a great deal of sum
mer business of the tourist variety.
People do not know what a beautiful
district the San Ramon Valley is in
summer. The road is well constructed
upon each side and has stood the first
winter in good shape."

Suit for divorce, on the ground of
desertion, was begun to-day by Dr.
Clarence M. Selfirfdge against Fannie E.
Selfridge. He also asks the court for
the custody of their 9-year-old daugh
ter. Mrs. Selfridge. ft Is stated, la
now living In San "Francisco.
They were married in this city In
1833. She was formerly Miss Fannie
E. Scott, and came from Sonoma
County, where her family Is well
known. The plaintiff Is the son of Dr.
J. A. Selfridge of this city, .and was
connected with his father In the con
duct of his practice here. Dr. Grant
Selfridge, a brother. Is a Sap Fran

To the Intimate acquaintances of the

their affairs does not come as a sur

East Oakland about a year ago. and
Mrs. Selfridge left Oakland, going to
San Francisco, while he took their
child and went to live with his parents.

The pilfering Is of books, hatpins,
ribbons, lunches and any of the little
trinkets that happen to be out of the
owner's) sight for a moment.
Petty thievery that has been going
on for. a long time at the Berkeley
High School prompted the principal.
Morris C. Jamer;, to call the students
together this morning and warn them
that examples would be made of the
culprits if they continued to prey upon
their fellows. But worst of all was
the statement by the principal that it
Is girl students who <lo the most thiev
ing, their own sex being the victims of
their persistent work.
"This stealing has been going on long
enough," he said, "and the culprits are
known to some of us and future of
fenses will be punished severely. It
is a terrible reflection on the Berkeley
High School that thieves are among
the students, but what will people say
when I say that the pilfering is more
common among the girls than the boys.
Those who do it are a discredit to their
cex and if they are caught dismissal
and disgrace will follow.
"We have set watches and proved
conclusively that it is students and not
outsiders who steal. Some c-f your pa
rents have complained to me about it,
and now I propose to stop It."

"The lamentable position of the late

T* HE report upon the progress of Alaskan develop
- ment made to" the '.Senate on Tuesday may not
have the effect of rousing Congress to take action
at this session for the promotion 'of the interest of that
great Territory, but it will undoubtedly serve as an im
portant document in the campaign of education to that
end. Senators Dillingham, Burhham, Nelson and Patter
son did^ their work, well. Their ; investigations appear
to have been as comprehensive as was possible consider
ing the vast area of the country and the limited time at
their command, and the conclusions they have drawn
from their observations and the testimony presented to
them at -different points constitute an able summary of
what ought to be done in the way of legislation to
facilitate the exploitation of : the great wonderland of
the north.
â¢ â¢ Governor Brady, in his annual-message directed the
attention of the Washington Government to what the
Canadian Government had done, to promote Yukon Ter
ritory, and contrasted the efficiency there with- the: lack
of it in Alaska." He dealt chiefly with the subject of
mining, and pointed out several important features of
Canadian policy which we would-do well, to follow, for
the benefit of Alaskan miners. The Senate committee,
like the Governor, . finds in the Canadian administration
much that should excite our emulation. The committed,
however, devotes ; most of its attention -in that respect to
the question of transportation, and cites figures to show
the advantage the miner in the Yukon has over the
Alaskan miner in the way of cheap food by -. reason of
the good roads on the : Canadian side of- the line and
the lack of them on "ours.
We are so accustomed to speak of ourselves as the.most
enterprising people on earth and to mock, at the Cana
dians as being slow that the revelations of the superior
enterprise of Canada- in. the development \ of Â¦ the north
ought to affect our pride, : if nothing else. There are
inanv recions of Alaska, however, rich enough to justify

Locomotive whistling has in our
country become a menace to public
comfort, sleep and health. We do not
mean the whistling or the engineers
at grade-crossings in the country
(which should also be done away with
by abolishing the grade-crossings), but
that of the switching engines in or
near towns and. cities, at work Â« all
night, and which is done solely for the
convenience of the trainmen. In no
other country in the world is this nius
arice allowed. In some of our cities
stringent la.ws exist against it, as e. g..
In Philadelphia, but they are utterly
ignored by the officers sworn to exe
cute the law. The officials seem to
prefer to execute the people. There
can be no doubt that a majority of the
people, of cities, especially in summer,
are injured -in health because of loss
of sleep, and that the sick and conva
lescent are dangerously ha. ied. All
physicians know how necessary sle^>
is to the . maintenance and re-estab
lishment of health. The whistling is
wholly unnecessary . and often is
against the rules of the company. Thus
because it is "nobody's. duty" to stop
it, a half dozen workmen "disobey the
railway rules and the. city ordinances
without check. But it is somebody's

days ago, at a time when the mar
riage license business was not very
brisk, "this is a good office for stories.
Hardly a day passes that something
does not happen that woulti prove of
interest to the reading public. For
instance, this morning shortly after I
opened up, a\ great, big stout woman,
well dressed tend bearing all the ear-,
marks of the rule or ruin kind of
woman came in and asked me If she
could get a license. I told her she cer
tainly could if there were no legal re
straints.
"'What do you mean by legal re
straints?' she Inquired.'
"I told her that the law required
that the persons about to embark on
the sea of matrimony should be able
to show that they had reached the age
of majority and that they had not
been divorced within a year.
" 'Humph,' she said, 'a woman can
get a license, can't she?' â¢
" 'Certainly,' I said, and 'then pro
ceeded to fill in a blank with the in
formation she gave me. The name of
the man was Brown and when I had
signed the license, collected the fee
and handed it to her she gave me a
snappy and curt 'Thank you' and
walked out. *
"Five minute3 later a meek "and
humble individual fairly sneaked in.
He walkejd up to the desk and in a
voice shaking with fear asked me if I
had just issued a license to a big, stout
woman. I told him I had and gave
him the woman's name.
"He was trembling like a leaf and
in a voice that was husky with emo
tion he asked me the name of the pros
pective groom. I was little prepared
for the startling change that came
over him when I told him it was
Brown.
"He breathed a sigh of relief that
could be heard out in the corridor and
almost shouted a fervent 'Thank God.'
I suppose I looked puzzled, for sud
denly he grinned, grasped my hand
and almost shook it off.
" 'You see,' he said, with another
convulsive shake 'of the" hand, 'she had
two of us oh a string. Brown and me.

It is in evidence that the members of the city govern
ment were alert to conditions only when they were re
fused free tickets to the theaters, and that then they
had not the skill to direct their correctional discipline to
the things required for safety. One officer, whose ex
actions were burdensome, sent in an order for twenty
five free seats for a theater' party. The manager refused
the seats. Immediately he was disciplined in the matter
of the porte cochere at the entrance to his place and
was hauled up for advertising on billboards in front. InJ
many other ways, in matters non-essential to the safety
of his patrons, he was persecuted until he surrendered,
and then all official discipline ceased.
This seems to have been .a common policy pursued by
every department of the city government except the
police. All managers testify to the abstention of the
police from any of these forms of graft. The money
drain on theater managers for the. benefit of official
grafters was so serious that naturally they sought to
make good by omitting expense in matters that con
cerned the safety of the people. Asbestos curtains were
omitted entirely or were imitations made of cotton. A
few chemical fire extinguishers were provided in the in
flammable scenery, when safety required ten times as
many. The top ventilators, needed to "draw flames l up
ward, were omitted, so that fire instantly followed the
air draught from the stage .toward the exits.* Audiences
are familiar with the cold draught that sweeps through
the auditorium when the curtain goes up. It is the
breath of death. It means the . lack of top ventilation
over the stage. Any official inspector with sense enough
to sign a payroll who felt that draught should have
known its meaning. But his sense of duty was subor
dinate to his free pass to the show.
We. do n.ot pretend that Chicago has the only unsafe
theaters. In nearly every city in the country there is
careless and criminal omission of the most obvious pre
cautions. The Mayor of Chicago is doing his duty late,
too late to save the 600, lives lost by neglect, but it is to
be'hoped that his belated activity will warn other May
ors that they, too, have been unmindful of the life-saving
precautions which prudence requires shall "be taken in all
places of assembly. It is better that every theater, hall
and church should be closed for a year, while they are
made safe, than that another horror shall chill the blood
of the world. -
THE Mayor of Chicago is taking active steps now
that should have been taken before, and if taken
in time would have prevented the theater horron
He claims credit for protecting life by closing all the
theaters in that city. He is the same sort of life-saver
as pins, which save .the lives of a great many people by
not being swallowed. The .revelations already before
the public show conditions in the theater that burned,
and in others that^have not, that were apparent to the
most casual official oversight. Official neglect is written
on the gravestone of every victim of the fire.
AFTER THE FACT.
"They are not in just now," replied
the steward; "perhaps I can furnish
you with what information you seek."
"Well, you mig'ht," said the woman.
"You see it is this way: My sister
thinks that I am crazy. As a matter
6t fact, she is the one who is out of
her mind. This morning she asked me
to come down here with her so that
the doctors could examine me. Now
I want the doctors to examine her, so I
fell right in with her suggestion and
came along. 1 She is in there now, talk
ing with the matron about me."
"Very well, madam." said the stew
ard, "I will speak to the doctors when
they come, if you -will try to keep her
here until they arrive. You would
better tell me a little something about
her hallucinations so that they will
know how to proceed."
"Well," whispered the woman, "it is
a. very sad case. Two months ago she
was as sane as I am. One day she
went around to our neighbors and
with tears streaming down her cheeks
told them all that I was out of my
mind because I said I had been se
lected to reign over England in Queen
Victoria's stead. Of course, I have
been, but "
t Arm in arm the two women walked
Into the hospital for the insane at the
City Hall. They were both large,
handsome women, well dressed and
having about them an air of refine
ment. The larger of the two requested
an interview with the matron, and
when that lady appeared she walked
'into her room with her, leaving her
companion in the room where are held
the examinations of the insane.
Presently the steward came along,
and, seeing the woman sitting there
alone in the examination-room, asked
her if she desired to see any one.
"Yep," she replied, "I wish to see
the doctors."
Vagaries of Insane.
There seems to be a general impression that within
the last few days something has dropped in the City
Hall. The sympathies of sorrowing circles of friends
have gone out to those who lost 'their positions, but no
one seems to .think it worth while to pity the men that
have violated the letter and- spirit of wise laws and have
re-established in the local government the specter of the"
spoils system and its attendant evils. x
- Xow th>Â» mechanism by which all
this is accomplished Is very complex;
and to understand it one must know
something of optics. Optics is a large
subject and we cannot hope in the
space at our comand to make it clear.
We may say, however, that rays of
light travel in a straight line, and that
these rays falling against a
lens are so affected that they
converge at a certain point beyond the
lens. Now the farther away the ob
ject from which the rays come the
farther from the lens will be the re
flection. Thus, in the ordinary eam
era, the distance of the plate from the
lens is regulated oy the distance of
the object to be photographed, and
the photographer slides the plate back
and forth until he has found the ex
act point at which the rays from the
object focus. â¢Â«*â¢
But there is another factor which
affects the focus of light rays passing
through a lens, and that is the shape
of the lens. The flatter the lens the
farther away will be the focal point.
So we 'see that there' are two ways
by which the rays from a distant body
may be brought to a" focus. One is
by moving the plate until it is at the
focal point, which is the method of
the camera. The other is by changing
the shape of the lens itself, which is
the method of the human eye.
Beyond this, however, the analogs'
between the eye and the camera does
not go. The eye has the power of au
tomatically adjusting itself so as to
throw the image upon the retina at
whatever distance that image may be;
also of regulating the amount that en
ters; and then the two eyes by fo
cusing upon an object, not only gain
the opportunity of seeing it from two
sides â of seeing partially around it, as
ly were â but can also Judge pretty
closely as to its distatice.
Of all the wonderful mechanical de
vices of the body the -most complex
and beautiful is undoubtedly the hu
man eye. The human eye is frequent
ly compared to a camera, but this is
quite unjust to the eye, for, while (he
principle is the same in each, the corn
era when compared to the eye is a
very crude and imperfect affair..
Between the living eye and the com
era no Just comparison is possible, for
the living: eye is capable of a large
number of adjustments which are im
possible to the camera. We may with
more justice compare the camera to
the dead eye. If we, take the eye of
an ox, removed from the body, and
scrape off the coats on the back part
of the eyeball; if we replace the coat
ings so removed with a thin plate of
mica, we shall see a tiny inverted im
age of the object in front of the eye â
shall see exactly what the photogra
pher does when he ducks his head un
der the black cloth and says, "Look
pleasant, please." ..
Both eye and camera are merely
dark chambers with a lens in front to
admit the light and make an image
by refraction. Both are lined with a
material impervious to light. For if
light were allowed to enter elsewhere
than through the lens it would blur
the image.

The same system that plans one's
work will Insure the necessary means of
rtninx it . The servant will not begin
The nearer one's daily tasks can be
brought to the point of being performed
automatically the easier they become.
Just as cue must forget his fingers be
fore he becomes a finished musician,
one must have grown wonted to th*
routine of the housework, first to that
planned for each day and then to the
rfivision of the tasks for each hour.
The woman who takes dishwashing, the
daily sweeoing and dusting, lamp fill
ing, et cetera, in the same order each
day will gain ease and time over the
one vho sometimes does cooking first,
Bometimf-s last, and so on. Minutes are
wasted while one stops to decide "what
to do next." She does better to plan
her work at the beginning and then to
follow persistently the course that she
has mapped out after due deliberation.
There is no part of the world where
housekeeping has been made such a
fetich as in the smaller New England
towns, and none where a woman's ap
preciation by her neighbors depends so
much upon her skill in housewifery.
She who writes or paints is accounted
& failure if she does not understand the
art of housekeeping. The New. England
woman of a generation ago did an im
mense amount of work, yet she always
had her afternoon free. The explana
tion is simple. She worked with system.
On Monday she washed, Tuesday saw
the clothes ironed, on Wednesday they
were looked over for rents, mended and
folded away; on Thursday windows
were wiped, silver polished, closets
tidied or any other task that came up
was attended to; weddings, parties and
festivities of all kinds were set for
Thursday, as it was the leisure day of
the week; Friday saw. the house thor
oughly swept from garret to cellar,
and Saturday was given over to extra
baking eo save cooking on Sunday and
Monday. These were the special duties
of the day. but every day had its share
of dish washing, bedmaklng, cleaning
and cooking, each In its regularly ap
pointed time, which never varied except
for sickness or other calamity. The
method is as successful to-day as it
ever was, though it is harder to carry
out. since the workers of the kitchen
to-day do not work with brairs as well
as with hands, nor take kindly to the
introduction of some one else's brains.
In rr.ar.y well run kitchens there is
provided a programme \Ot the day's
work in the order of its coming. When
there are several servants the sched
ule for each is provided, and where this
â¢9 done the work is as well ordered
as is that of the bfg department store.
Conditions differ bo greatly in families
that no ere can mark out such a pro
gramme for another, buf each woman
know? â or ought to â what is needed in
her home, and by the exercise of a little
tact she can prevail upon her assistant
to follow the programme, and after the
latter finds herrelf with % more leisure
and less weariness because of this ar
rangement she will be glad to adopt it.
The programme should not be changed
from week to week. Each Monday
should have the same division of tasks
end hours, and so on through all' the
week.
The theory of doing a piece of work
"when it is necessary" sounds well,
but its application is not usually pro
ductive of pleasing or comfortable re
sults. Taking week in and week out,
each day has duties -which should be
carried out on that day if the house
hold machinery is to run smoothly.
There may be exceptions for special
occasions, but holding to the rule
brings peace in the family and keeps
th*> strain of housework and its super
vision from ijeing too heavy for the
housewife and the family.
There was a notable New England
housekeeper who was wont to say to
her daughters. "Don't dawdle, make
every move tell, and you'll never be
too tired and never lack time." That
way for working compels one to be
systematic, for the brains direct and
one follows the old adage, "Let your
head save your heels."
Whether one is the fortunate woman
vho does her own work or the un
fortunate who has to depend upon one
or a dozen servants, system is equally
needed. If one lacks it let her culti
vate it diligently. It leads to rested
nerve*, stored-up strength, and bo to
happiness in the home. Its sole dis
advantage is one that applies to per
sonal vanity. The woman who labors
systematically, though she will accom
plish twice as much as another who
does not, never seems to the unob
servant to be doing much because she
never has confusion about her and al
ways, has time for what she wants
to do.
The greatest difference between the
house mother's and the merchant's
management is in the matter of sys
tem. While one should not be a slave
to routine of labor there is not the
least doubt that system lightens house
keeping almost one-half. She who
knows Just when a piece of work
should be done knows also how it
should be, and there will be no time
wasted, nor will there be any hurry-
Ing or confusion. The house where
the -work is never done, where ironing,
sweeping and cooking come together,
is the house without a head, for
system is of the head. It is the appli
cation of brains to the task one has
to do.

Francis Darwin's story of the plants
and the bassoon emphasizes once more
the old truth that fiction Is often, the
forerunner of fact, as well as the cir
cumstance that the humorist is apt to
describe in irresponsible frivolity what
the grave scientist may later embody
in his thought-out SLystem. According
to Mr. Darwin, It was many years ago
that his Illustrious father made him
play the bassoon to plants in order to
test whether they were sensitive, to
sound: and it Is certainly thirty years
since the American humorist Max Ad
eler described for the amusement of
countless thousands Judge Pitman's
musical experiment in natural history.
The Judge had read in the Atlantic
Monthly, it may be recalled, that the
iguana was susceptible to music, and
that some professor had caused it to
arise and come to him when he played
to it on the piano. The worthy Pit
man, not quite catching the name- of
that which had proved so amenable to
harmony, thought he would give the
thing a trial; and, going to his barn,
he tried the effect of the fiddle upon a
bag of guano. "A Life on the Ocean
Wave." "Old Hundred"! and "Mary
Blaine" were alike powerless r to
move the inanimate object, though each
tune was played "backward and sfdÂ«Â»
way3 and cat-a-cornered," -as well as
given "a paasel o* extra sharps and
flats and exercises." But "narry time
did that guanner bag git up off that
flcor"; and the .Judge's opinion of
writing men in general and scientists
in particular was sadly lowered by tha
failure of his experiment. â "Westminster

expensive buildings recently construct

If is timely now, while as yet there is no near menace
of disturbance, for all conservative citizens to fix their
minds firmly on the right side of the general question, so
that they may not be turned aside into a disordered
partisanship by any agitation that may burst forth later
on. We live in an age of organized associations .of all
kinds, and must learn to tolerate alb combinations . of
citizens, whether capitalists or laborers, so long as they,
obey the. laws and respect the person and the property
of others. \i that be not done our fat years will but fur
nish fat to feed the fire of strife. The plea for harmony
then must be accompanied by a broad sympathy with the
rights of every class of citizens, and a recognition of the
truth that nothing is to'be gained by infusing the coming
political campaign with any taint of class prejudice one
way or the other.
MAYOR SCHMITZ. in his annual message sub
mitted to the Board of Supervisors on Monday,
very properly directed attention to some of the
signs of the. times that are ominous of a conflict between
labor and capital before 'the year is'over. The issue is
not" directly one that concerns the municipal administra
tion, but none the less it was right that the chief execu
tive of the city should give earnest consideration to it,
since upon him will rest the heaviest burden of responsi
bility to maintain the peace and good order of the com
munity, with all the rights of person and property
should such a conflict take place.
The Mayor, of course, makes . a plea for harmony.
That was to be expected from one in his official position
and of his political sagacity, even if it werj: not
prompted, as it doubtless was, by his sense of duty to his
fellow-citizens. He has nothing to gain by industrial
disturbance, -for his administration will be creditable and
honorable exactly in proportion as its influence : counts
on the side of continued prosperity based upon unin
terrupted 1 industry and enterprise. His language on the
subject bears the evident impress of sincerity and shows
a conviction on his part that an overwhelming majority
of those who were his partisans in the late campaign ex
pect him to direct his administration along conservative
lines and fulfill his pledge of acting in office as the repre
sentative of the. whole people, showing no favoritism on
the one hand, nor antagonism on the other, to any class
or element of the population.
In making the plea'for harmony, the Mayor does not
stand alone. From all sides and from all parties, classes
and elements of the people are to be heard voices mak
ing the selfsame plea. Everybody, except the few who
see some' prospect! of personal gain or notoriety from a
period of strife, is on the side of peace. The community
has been very prosperous, and as the Mayor points out
the past two years have been "essentially years of peace
and 1 of freedom from violent strife." All who j have
profited by that peaceful prosperity desire its continu
ance. All will be well, therefore, if those who sincerely
desire harmony can agree up.on a policy of maintaining
it, and adhere to that policy tio matter who oppose it.
The danger of disturbance lies in the possibility
that there may be a disagreement as to the best policy
to pursue, and rival leaders may precipitate a "conflict
by their very desire to assure peace. . There are lines in
the Mayor's message that raise a fear that he himself may
fall into that error, and accordingly the issue cannot be
ignored.
That the conditions of the time are full of danger
points is beyond question. The flood tide of industrial
prosperity that has borne us forward so buoyantly
shows signs of having reached the highest level. There
is danger that the inevitable ebb may set in with the
spring, and coincide with the bursting forth of partisan
excitements that invariably attend a Presidential elec
tion. Should that happen, it is not unlikely that even in
San Francisco, where we have had such fat years for
labor and capital alike, and where there is little proba
bility -oi any such slump in work- and wages as menaces
the East, we "may have, a very critical period to
pass through- before the year is over. It is. therefore,
in the highest degree important that the plea forÂ»har
mony be made and be listened to with a full understand
ing that there is to be a mutual give and take all along
the line, to the end that substantial justice may be done
to all parties interested in every issue that arises.
One of the laborers had been read
ing a magazine article in which a great
European statesman was referred to
as a "twentieth century Brutus." The
question before the house was, "What
Is a Brutus. An idler asseverated that
"Brutus" was a misprint and the word
was intended for "brute." Some one
else once knew a bull terrier named
Brutus. Others had different opinions
which might well have given uÂ»rest
to the departed soul of the ancient
wlelder of a dagger. Colonel Julius look
ed on with supreme disdain. "When the
rest had finished he opened his mouth
and "spake as one having authority."
"Brutus was a man.!' he declared.
"I knew him well back in the oil dis
trict. His name was Abraham Lincoln
Brutusâ named after the Presidentâ
and spent most of his time when he
wasn't drunk picking chickens. Tour
twentieth century Brutus was a chick
en picker, my son," concluded Colonel
Julius, as he sawed off another dream
from his plug of "Lonely Star."
Colonel Julius is a native of the Key
stone State. One of the bit: companies
struck oil on his farm and. like a wise
gentleman. Ire came "West to, spend his
money. He has taken up his abode on
Post street, and gets his chief enjoy
ment out of life at a half finished ho
tel around the corner, where he solves
all abtruse diplomatic and political
problems for the argumentative labor
ers. His early education, it must be
said, was sadly neglected. Colonel Ju

ever, but Doses as the only genuine
modernized oracle.

pur Government in promoting their exploitation, even
if we had no rival to stimulate us" to the task. Governor
Brady reports the mining, industries of the Territory to
be already so large and so varied that he could not ade
quately deal with them in his message. The Senate
committee itself undertook hardly more than a summary
of the whole. In 1902 the output of gold for the Terri
tory reached- the value. of $8,345,800, and as yet the sur
face has been hardly more than, scratched at any point
in the gold fields.
Referring to the gold districts the committee re
ports that Seward Peninsula, of which Nome is the cen
ter, is the richest of the gold districts so ifar as is known,
and that next in order'come the gold districts of South
eastern Alaska, around Juneau, and, third/ the Yukon
district. It is^noted that the Nome district has the ad
vantage of cheap supplies because it can be reached
by ocean steamers. The Yukon country is handicapped
in that respect to some extent, but the committee re
ports it to be a land of great possibilities.
Taken! altogether,. the report can hardly fail to impress
Congress with the importance : of our rich possessions
in' Alaska and incline the more statesmanlike members
to feel a pride in assisting in its development. Favor
able legislation may therefore be expected from this
lime on. The probability thus given of an increased
energy in the. exploitation of Alaska ought to be a mat
ter of interest to San Francisco merchants and manu
facturers, for the field is a vast one and the market that
will ere long exist there for all kinds of goods is worth
seeking out diligently and early.

forgotten â an experience only too ccm
mon in the average ill-organized house
hold. To avoid this let a slate and
pencil be hung in kitchen and wash
room, so that a. note may be made of
any article which is getting low. The
time to buy is before one is out of the
necessity.
Time spent in waiting for one's tools
is time wasted in the worst way, for
it is taking from the hours, that should
be spent In rest and amusement, and
is carrying into the afternoon the work
that should be dorte in the morning.
Too many housekeepers proceed after
Amy March's motto and "take time by
the fetlock," therefore they find them
selves perplexed over many things
without finding that the cause as well
as the possible remedy for the trouble
lie in themselves. .

KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Jan. 15. â Ad
dressing the convocation of Episcopal
Bishops of the Sixth Missionary Dis
trict here to-day, the Rev. Dr. Lloyd
of New York, general secretary of the
board of managers of the Foreign Mis
sionary Society, aroused such enthu
siasm by his description of the sort of
men needed in the church.
The reason, he said, that the best
men with the most manhood do not
offer themselves for the priesthood
nowadays is because the calling has
been belittled by misrepresentation.
The church needs men fit to be presi
dents of railroads; â¢ it needs Western
men, if the nation is to be truly Ameri
can, and, said Dr. Lloyd, "It cannot be
made rightly American, as Henry
Clay said, only by the prayer book and
the constitution. It's no use to bring
Eastern men to the West; they don't
do well. Some few have been driven
West, because the East would not feed
them, and in consequence the very
best stuff In America Is this side of
the Mississippi River. The kind we
want here are Western men."
The convocation will meet at Omaha
next year, j
BUTTE. Mont., Jan. 13.â The disbar
ment case against A. J. Shores and D.
Gay Stivers, attorneys for the Amal
gamated Company; whom Judge Har
ney sought to have disbarred from
practicing law in the State, was dis
missed to-day.
The case was dismissed by Judge Mc-
Clernon at the conclusion of taking of
testimony, the. court refusing to hear
arguments. The charges made by
Judge Harney v.ere to the effect that
Colonel Shores and Captain Stivers, as
counsel for the Amalgamated Copper
Company, had attempted to bribe him
in connection with the decision in the
suit between F. Ausxistu- Heinze and
the Amalgamated Copper Company for
the ownership of the Minnie Healey
mine, - ich was decided in favor of
Heinze. In that trial and in subsequent
proceedings it was sought to show that
Jud^e Kamey had been bribed by the
HÂ«jrji* Interests to render a decision
favorable to them, and similar evidence
was presented at the disbarment pro
ceedings. The court in dismissing the
case held in effect that Shores and
Stivers Â«5id no wrongful act in offering
Judge Haraey money for evidence that
he had been bribed by the opposing in
terest, because they had reason to be
lieve they were asking the truth.

MATERIAL FOR THE CHURCH
There is S opportunity for interest in
a study of the gains and decreases in
the mineral output ' * certain States
outside of California as" reported by
the United States Director of the Mint.
In Colorr Â¦â¢'. as compared with 1902,
the output of 1903 decreased $6,423,000
in gold and $791,000 in silver. The de
creases are attributed officially to the
miners* strikes in Colorado, which led
to the shutting down of many good
mines. In Alaska the gold output of
1903 was $1,424,000 less than that of
1902. In the case of Alaska the de
crease in gold and also a decrease of
$32,000 in. silver finds explanation in the
fact that the season in " which . water
was available for mining purposes was
one month shorter than In prevlpus sea
sons. Thet.gold output of Oregon de
creased $452,000, and South Dakota also
had to chronicle a decrease in gold of
$4,076,000 on the, basis of the report.
Whye the great falling off in South
Dakota naturally excites wonderment
on account of the magnitude' of the
reported shortage, the great increase In
other quarters were just as noteworthy.
In Utah, for instance, the gold increas
ed $1,470,000 and the silver increased
$2,360,000. or about $3,800,000 In total
for the two precious .metals. The State
of Washington nearly balanced its
gains and losses in' the figures of min
ing of precious metals by showing the
gains to amount to $162,000 fn gold,
but having a loss of $164,000 in the fall
ing off in the amount o. silver mined.
Nevada gained all around in 1903, the
total gÂ£tin being^more than $1,000,000.
The gain In gold is set at $681,0QP and
the- silver gain at $391,000.
While superficial observers may
imagine that the silver industry is
near disuse, the official : nt figures
tend to disabuse the mind of this fal
lacy. The price of silver' went up with
an enlarged demand. The total gold
output of Alaska, Arizona, California,
Colora . Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
New Mexic f Oregon, South Dakota,
Utah and Washington . in value
$74,425,:40, and - Mst t'lis the total
production of silver in the same States
and T tories amented in value to
$30,620,68S. Taking these States and
Territories together and including a
few States of minor production afforCs
a showing of a total net decrease of
the gold output amoantinr; to $5,57|,000,
and a net increase In silver production
for the year lfO3 amounting in value to
$1,100,000.
Montana produced more silver . than
gold in value, the difference being, ap
proximately, $1,300,000 in favor of sil
ver. Utah's silver output surpassed its
gold product by more than $3,000,000.
While California was . the second
State in gold production, its total gold
output equaled that of Alaska, Arizona,
Nevada and Oregon, within $150,000,
which is something to" be remembered.
The figures will' not detract anything
from a fair showing for California.
FIGURES ARE -ATTACKED. ,
The J.Iinin'g and Scientific Press at
tacks the accurrcy of the sup
plied by the Mint Director, and alleges
that they are only based on guess
work, and it instances South Dakota
to prove its contention. The showing
made by the journal in question is
given as follows:
The Director of the ITnited States Hint at
Washington has issued what purports to-be pre
liminary statistics on the precious metal pro
duction of the United States for 1903. The fig-,
ures are so obviously incorrect for some States
that a doubt Is created as to the value of the
estimates foe others. The statement published
Heeivhfrre herein, which was Issued by the
Washington official, credits South Dakota with
a production of 82.SS0.137 Gold and $170,065 "sil
ver for 190.*;. The gold and silver mines of
South liakota are all in a limited area In the
Black Hills, and never within twenty years has
the output been, as small as $3.00f>.0nO. The
Homestake Company alone produces more than
$4.. r .0Q.0O0 yearly, and this amount Is being an
nually Increased. nÂ»sldes this company, the
Golden Reward. Penobscot, Spearfish. Standard.
Clover Leaf. Hidden Fortune, Wasp Xo. 1 and
Xo. 2. and p great number of other companies
output -not less than $1.. "00.000 annually; which
will make South Dakota's output exceed J6.00O.
000. As to the other States mentioned in the
report the errors arc Ipes noticeable. "
The Red Bluff Sentinel reports that
one of the Oroville dredging companies
has bonded eigh.ty-five acres of the riv
er bar just east of Red Bluff. The
company will prospect the land with a
diamond drill and if the expected gold
is found the" purchase of the land will
be completed.
The Tuolumne Independent says that
operations will be resumed soon at the
Harvard mine, near Jamestown. The
Lamphier mine at Confidence will be
opened in the spring.
The Little Giant mine above Colum
bia has been bonded to S. W. Wilhelm.
The Benjamin Harrison quartz mine
near Jacksonville and a part of the
Clio quartz mine has been deeded to
the Republican Mining and Develop
ment Company.
Negotiations are in progress for the
sale of thÂ» Soulsby mine to Eastern
parties.;
The directors of the Del Monte Min
ing and Milling Company met recently
at Jackson, Amador County, and lev
ied an assessment of 10 cents a share
on the stock.
Improvements at the Kennedy mine
will give the mine nine boilers in total
and a lifting capacity of 1000 horse
power to the hoist.
WORKING OF ORES.
The mineral oil produced In the Coal
lnga field in 1903 is estimated to have
amounted to 2,075,000 barrels.
Tellurlde ores are reported to have
been found in La Crosse mine near
Randshurg.
The North Star Mining Company has
bought 220 acres in the Loutzgelser
ranch and a!eo the Loutzgeiser inter
ests 'n the Lamarque mine near Grass
Valley.
Ten stamrjs will be added to 'the out
fit of the California mine near Wash
ington, Nevada County, in the spring.
A deposit of ochre is reported to have
been discovered -not far from Gilroy.
C. B. Rogers has bought several min
ing claims near White River,' Tulare
County, and is equipping the old
Eclipse: mine. \
Twenty-three'" riewj milling plants,
having altogether 166 stamps, were
erected In Eastern Oregon in 1903, and
also roll mills having a capacity equiv
alent to 96 stamps. In addition to this
a 150-ton smelter and a 100- ton: furnace
and sampling mill .were put up at
Sump ter. Three important projects f or
supplying electricity derived from water
power, in the Sumpter district. Baker
County, have been practically com
pleted.
The mines in the Olinghouse camp
near Wadsworth, '..Nevada, produced
$30,000 in value last year.
The Boston-Nevada copper claims at
Yerington, Lyon County, Nevada, will
be reopened. There are seventeen
claims In the group.
There Is an increasing demand "for
rare minerals of which California pro
duces a variety. Such minerals are
used principally in Germany; and in
France whore applied chemistry is far
advanced. An exporter of rare minerals
In the East is quoted by the Mining
"World as saying that tungsten ores
have never before been so much in de
mand as they are now. Thijy brinx
$195 a ton. Continuing,' the -Mining
"World says:
Titanium ores are not yet In much demand,
but will be in the very near future, hb they arÂ«
Invaluable for ateÂ«l manufacture, when'propÂ«rly
unUcrstood. The price Is about $130 a short ton.
Uranium ores are in constant demand, but arÂ«
ecarca and the price consequently high, about
$000 a ton. Vanadium ores would' be In great
demand if a large quantity could be assured,
but this Is more scarce than the uranium ores.
Carnotlte, a compound ore of uranium and va
nadium oxide, is also scarce, and salable at a
high price. Molybdenite, although found al
most everywhere, occurs only in small quanti
ties, except in Canada,- and â¢ while there is a
steady demand for about 10,000 tons a year,
not mere than one-fifth- of â¢'this amount has
be*jj furnished in any one year, and that most
ly from abroad; the price ranges from $400 to
$12fiO a. ton of 2000 pounds.
Monazlte is In greater demand and "will ba
more sought after in the near future. At pres
ent It Is chiefly valuable for the thorium con
tents,' whirh ranges frcm 2 per* cent to 8 per
cent thorium, used In Welsbach gas mantels.
The price is $100 to $250 a ton of 2000 pounds.
Samarsklt* Is not much in demand and is also
6carce. Columblte is frequently Inquired fdr,
but thÂ« demand is not gresit. Other rare min
erals are mostly used so far for laboratory
purposes only. The acids of the rare minerals
are now being Inquired for and sales Increasing
for the reason that the cost of manufacture
has been very much decreased.
HAVE;. MANY USES.
The rare metals arÂ« absolutely neceisary
for the manufaeturo or armor plate and tool
steel, which is far superior to the old grades
and Is a scientific steel. In a general way
It may be said that tungsten is used to harden
eteel. titanium to tourhen It, molybdenum for
flexibility, vanadium for elongation and uran
ium /or purification and consequently homo
geneity. These elements are generally used as
alloys with Iron and ar* spoken of as the
"Ferros" of rare minerals. Thus the uses
of these alloys are each distinct and special
and more than one element may be introduced
into, the eteel for its adaptation to iomÂ«
epeolflc end.
â¢ The rare minerals have also many other uses
In other industries than steel, .for. Instance,
titanium, which can also be used as*-mor
dant In dyeing. In fertilizing, in the manu
facture of nmsnonla (on account of lta great
affinity for .nitrogen). In combination with
metallic silicon to produce an artificial bort
(black diamond), and alloyed with aluminum
will give a great strength and conductivity in
excess of copper with three times the length
of wire for the samp weight. Uranium com
pounds are used in the manufacture of glass
and porcelain and In photography. Vanadium
compounds are also used In dyelpg and for
colorinc glass and aa an alloy of copper and
aluminum as well as of Iron
Dennis H. Stovall writes to the Pa
cific Coast Miner in reference to the
harnessing of the Rogue River power
to furnish greater facilities for Dninjngr
in Southern Oregon that the water of
the river is raised twenty feet abov*
its original bed. This .will supply 10,000
horsepower for a greater part ol! the
season, and never less than 6000. Fits
are now being blasted ;for two. turbines,
capable of developing 700 horsepower
each., A 250-ki:owatt ( "generator y/ill
take ud and convey the power by wire
to the surrounding mines, mills and
towns for power and lighting purposes.
The Ralston and Monterey gold min
ing companies report a strike of KOld.
The mines are in the San Lucas Moun
tains in Monterey County. The prop
erty was first discovered in 1888. Quite
a rush to the vicinity then took place,
but it soon died out. J. W. Van Wlukie
is president of the corporatlc-n now ope
rating the property. It is reported that
a Btampmill will soon be erected.
The Los Angeles Times says of m*.n
ing in. the south during the year 19CJ:
Production of gold In this southwestern
reelon was not so great during th* year Just
closed as it was for the year 1902. labcr
strikes were the caU5Â«s of this. At Randsburg.
Cal.. and at Searchlight. Newâ essentially
gold camps â the mines were shut down "and
remained dosed for four months, as a result
making the year's production one-third less
than It would otherwise have been. The g'old
camps of Yavaoai County, Arizona, also- had
their labor troubles. Happily, however, labor
troubles in these several districts are at an
end; the mines have been, reopened and are
a*aln being worked full time. With the ex
ception of sold all metals and minerals . will
show Increased productions.
The reports of the State Mining Bureau
furn'sh an excellent illustration of the In
crease In mining In Southsrn California.
Those for the year 1903 have not yet been
compiled, but those for the two preceding
years will sufficiently demonstrate what this
Increase is. The total value of metals and
minerals produced In ten counties of Southern
California during the year 1901 was $7.97.1.938.
The same ten counties produced in 1802 metals
and minerals of a value of 111. 807.012. an in
crease In one year of $3,8CK>,ft74, equal to an
Increase o* BO per cent. In only one of these
ten counties is a decrease reported, while In
two of them production nearly doubled â thsy
are , Kern and San Bernardino counties.

Caused by a Germ.
Split hair, hard hair, lusterless hair,
brittle hair, falling hajr. all owe their-
origin to dandruff, which Is caused by a
measly little microbe that burrows into
the scalp, throwing up the cuticle into
dandruff scales and sapping the vitality
of the hair at the root, causing the sev-
eral diseased conditions of the hair till it
llnally falls out. Modern science has dis-
covered a remedy to destroy the dand'uff
microbe, which is combined in Newbio's
Herpicide. the delightful /hair dressing.
Allays itching instantly and makes hair
soft as silk. Take no substitute; nothing

by Judge Cabaniss to pay a fine of
$100 each for conducting a gambling

The foundation, piles and stringers for
the new cuarters of the South End
Bowing Club are in- position and plans
for a commodious- clubhouse are under
consideration, . The â¢ handball court
owned by the club was sold some time
ago and the old clubhouse, which there
was some talk of removing to a new
site, will probably be sold for the lum*
ber in it.
Work. Is progressing satisfactorily on
the hew Quarters of the Ariel Rowing
Club, the outer part of the structure
being finished sufficiently to- house the

as lockers and decoration, will be com

At ths last meeting of the Alameda
Boating Club' there was a keen con
test, among the candidates for election
as officers to serve during the coming
half year. Charles H. Smith, who had
filled . the . office of president . for more
than a dozen terms, having announced
his intention not to be a candidate for
re-election. W. B. Hinchman, who had
fulfilled t the duties of secretary ever
since the foundation of the club, was
selected by the rowing men of the or
ganization as their candidate for presi
dent, but was defeated. The following
â¢were elected: A. Kihm, president; F.
S/Cone, vice president; F. E. Brown
ing, secretary; A. G. Bell, treasurer;
Z. T,Thorning, captain; B. G. Lyons,
lieutenant captain; John Hammond,
John Trainor and W. L. Frier, mem
bers of the executive board; Roy Pratt,
sergeant at arms. Arrangements are
being made for an entertainment to
take place at the clubhouse.

The Dark club has manymore play
ers than. the California Club,, but there
Isj a decided lack of class. The only
way to even up matters would be to
have the. No. 1 team of. the California
Club play the No. 9. team of the Golden
Gate Club and No. 2 play No. 8, and
so on. In this way some of the'matches
â¢would go to the park players, although
the rest would be j too one-sided to be
Interesting. The Californja Club teams
would be picked from the following:
J: D. -MacGavln. Will Allen, W. B. Col^

The idea is a good one andworthy
of encouragement; .but | it is doubtful
if the park player's can send nine teams
that will v be able to 'make, the club
members extend themselves. ! Most of
the best players, of .the park club are
in reality California Club members and
would represent the latter in a meeting
between tha two. Such men as' Mac-
Gavin â¢ and Allen I would play f ot the
California Club.
The idea is to have each club pick
nine doubles teams, and have No, 1
meet Xo. 1 teamand No. 2meet No. 2
team, and so on. The challenge has been
accepted by the California Club and the
matches will be played at Scott and
Bush. streets on the 24th inst.
The Golden Gate Tennis Club has
issued a challenge to the California
Tennis Club for a meeting to be held
on the latter's- courts to-morrow. On
account of the handicap doubles the
date of the challenge has been changed
to one week later.
The handicap doubles tennis tourna
ment which was commenced two .weeks
ago will be finished to-morrow at Gold

been finished last Sunday, but the rain

The members of the San Francisco
Scottish Bowling Club are at present
wondering when the two large tourna
ments on their hands will be completed.
The drawing and preliminary arrange
ments for both were made several
weeks ago, but the club is without a
green upon which to play the matches.
The new green has been used so con
stantly of late that the grass was found
to be-dying, and it was thought best
to close It for several weeks.' New
grass has started and with'a little care
the sreen will,.. shortly, be as good as
ever. In the meantime the tourna

William Greer Harrison.. Kenneth

"fans" and watch the hard ball players
with much interest.' Charles Sullivan
Jim McElroy and Bill Kennedy are
back into the game and are gradually
rounding into form. ';"'*..*Â¦
J. C. Nealon, the veteran handball
player, has been forced to give up the
game until he recovers the use of an
injured flnjjer. Jack Bonnet is getting
back to his old-time form and controls
the ball with great skill. George James
is also coming to the front again.' He
is a strong and aggressive player and
never quits. Hughey Jones and Tom
Curley play together.in the evening and
enjoy some fast games. Leader Jack
Gleason plays occasionally, and plays
well. For a heavy man he gets around
the court in speedy fashion. He con
templates holding a doubles tourna
ment for hard ball players in the near
future.
On Sundays the big court is crowded
with spectators, who watch the crack
players of the club in single and double
handed games. Al.Hampon no longer
plays in championship form. He
strained the muscles In his right should
er and he cannot hit the ball as he
would like to. "Heiney" Corey is the
coming player of the club. Corey has
an awkward toss, but drives the ball
with great speed. Every Sunday after
noon Jack Bonnet, Louis Levy, George
Cunningham ah'd Corey play exhibition
games. These are watched with great
interest by the members.
Henry Russ is one of the best single
handed players in the club. Young
Pockwitz also plays^ well. Monroe
Green drives the ball with great force.
Poheim injured his arm playing the
game and it has set him back. Max
Rosenfeld plays. a strong game. "Tiv"
Kreling, the Klondike champion, is fast
and usually plays a hard game. Harry
Bogen is a little overweight and is not
playing his game. Otis Crable uses his
clenched first in striking the ball, and
he controls it cleverly. He is able to
send the ball ur> with terrific force.
Judge Fritz keeps his avoirdupois down
by playing handball, and he plays a
brilliant game. Dr. E. X. Short, Dr.
Morton, Dr. Gibbons, Dr. Rumwell, Dr.
Converse and other well-known . mem
bers of the medical profession play the
soft-ball game with great cleverness.
George James and Jack Gleason have
essayed the game, but will have to
stick to the hard ball as the ceiling is
too low in the .little courts. Charlie
Knight keeps In shape, as does George
Birdsall. playing the game. Garnet Fer
guson and Bobby Bowman have â¢ de
serted the hard ball game. Guy Ran
some and Leo Starr alternate between
the courts on the roof and ihe hard bail
court.
Handball has taken great strides In
the past year at the Olympic Athletic
Club. The four courts are always
crowded with players, while spectators
fill the galleries. The soft ball seems
to have more devotees, as the man who
uses his hands in his profession or busi
ness can play the game without danger
of Injuring those useful members.
At the present time a doubles tour
nament for the championship of the
club is in progress. Tom Magee and F.
Bayne are the best pair in the tourna
ment. They have met and defeated
Pockwitz and Poheim, Crable and Bo
gen. Powers and Fritz and other clever
players. Magee Is in the East, and on
his return he and Bayne will play Russ
and Bowman.

Advantage was taken of the pres
ence of so lar^e a number of mem
bers to discuss in an informal manner
the course to be pursued by the club
with reference to the "ways" used for
hauling boats out for cleaning and re
pairs. The club at present owns a set
of "wavs" at Sausalito that will ac
commodate boats not exceeding 45 or
1.0- feet over all. but it does not own
the lar.d on which the "ways" are built.
Jt was explained to the members that,
Â¦while the possession Â«3f "ways" is de-
Firable, the purchase of the land on
Â¦which the "ways" now stand would not
necessarily secure their use to the club
permanently, since the owners of wa
ter lots in front of the land might fill
in their property and cut off the "ways"
from access to the waters of the bay.
The matter will be discussed more fully
at the annual meeting.
The nominating committee will pre
pare a list of nominees for the offices
of the club, which list will constitute
the regular ticket to be presented to
the members at the annual election
of officers to serve during the coming
twelve months. The meeting will be
held on the second Wednesday In Feb
ruary.
The names suggested by one party
of the members were those of Dr. T.
L. Hill, James Logan and F. H. An
drews, and by the other party those of
ex-Commodore George E. Billings,
George T. S. White and Dr. W. L.
Spencer. At the first attempt to cast
a ballot it was found the numbers of
ballots exceeded the number of mem
bers present when the roll was called.
After a good deal of discussion it was
decided to call the roll' again, each
member depositing his ballot as his
name was called. James Logan re
ceived 51 votes. Dr. T. L. Hill 4 9. while
Oeorge E. Billings and F. H. An
drews lied. George E. Billings retired
from the contest and James Logan, Dr.
T. L. Hill and F. H. Andrews were
declared elected. G. T. S. White and
Dr. W. L. Spencer received 46 votes
each.
At the meeting of the members of
the San Francisco Yacht Club, held on
Wednesday evening in this city, nearly
120 members were present, though
more than a dozen of these went .away
before the voting was concluded.. The
chief object of the meeting was to elect
a nominating committee of three

February 21-22. The California plate,
for greyhounds of all ages, will be run
at the same time.
Palo Alto and Pocatelll. the rival
champions, will make their reappear
ance in a seventy-two dog stake to
morrow at Union Coursing Park. Both
have been given some extra prepara
tion in view of the strength of the
hares which are being coursed. The
coursing will commence upon the ar
rival of the 10:15 o'clock train. There
will also be a train at 1 o'clock. The
likely winners look to be:

Charles Matteson. who was ruled off
by the" California Coursing Committee a
year and a half ago, has been rein
stated. He was Implicated In the Hes
per-Whisper case, and the committee
thought he had been sufficiently pun
ished.
The question of a revision of the
rules governing the scoring of points in
coursing is being discussed by followers
of the sport of the leash. The rules in
vogue to-day are those drafted a cen
tury ago, and they are said to be out of
date in the present condition of the
sport.
Few people have mastered them, but
spectators are quick to follow the lead
of any one questioning a judge's deci
sion. T. J. McHugh. who has been Iden
tified with coursing for many years as
an official at Ingleslde Park, offers the
following- timely suggestions:
I have sÂ«*n all the Judges of coursla* la
California for the laÂ»t quarter of a century
and I hare noted that whether a. greyhound
shows two. three or four lengths of Â«pÂ«ea
over an opDCnent he Is Invariably Â«lven tn<Â»
same credit for thÂ« auDeriorlty Â¦hawn. xnÂ«Â»
allowance Is two points for speed and one tor
the turn. If a dorr leads another Â»lx or eight
lengths to the hare I believe he should bÂ«
credited with one point few each length. ThÂ«
rule *ays: "SDeed shall be estimated as one.
two or three points according to the degree or
superiority shown." This Is the rule apart
from the clause relatins to the score for the
This rule has been In roeue for the last
century and nhould surely be brought up to
date. I would suggest that a number of com
petent men owning greyhounds confer with th#
California Coursing Committee. Thev could
draft a rule that would encourage the brewing
of extreme soeed into greyhounds. They
would probably find other rule* In need of
revision if they continued their worlc ThÂ»
judging of coursing: Is a complicated art and
few people have mastered its Intricacies to an
extent which qualifies them to criticize tha
hard-working officials who preside In th* sad
dles.

Jack Gleason was. acting for him

X XEW ORLEANS RACE RESULTS.
McCloud is a compactly built black,
white and tan English setter by Trihy
Bov, out of Sadie Hopkins. He dis
played rare field qualities. He is a
fast and wide ranger and keeps pegging
away every moment he is down. His
work on birds is of a decided order
and he is liable to land at the too of
the list.
Following the all-age stake the mem
bers' stake, open only to members of
the club, was started. The first brace,
consisting of J. W. Flynn's pointer,
Nelly Bang, handled by her owner, and
H. W. Keller's English setter! Sombra,
handled by her owner, were cast off in
high grass and worked through a
slough bottom lined with heavy cover.
A bevy v/as soon flushed by spectators
and the - dogs settled down to work.
Nelly was first \to point and she fol
lowed this with another find. Crossing
into the adjoining field she ran into
another bevy, which scattered out.along
the bottom. Sombra now got to work
and ran up four* points in quick suc
cession to ' one of which she i behaved
rather badly. Down forty minutes.
' Mr. Tevis not being upon the grounds
with Cuba of Kenwood, the bye dog.
Mr.Van Arsdale's English setter Count's
Mark, handled by his owner, was put
down, with Cuba Jr. as a brace mate.
Count's Mark was somewhat wild at the
Kiigarif. the winner of the second, is
a large black, white and tan dog by
Orion, out of Mary Lou. He hardly
displayed the form shown last year
when he won the Derby hands down.
Kiigarif showed good speed and range,
coupled with clever style, and displayed
splendid judgment in his work on birda.
Me is not as taking as his kennel mate.
Lady, but is a dangerous competitor
in any company.
The winner of the first Is a sweet lit
tle English setter of refined type, and
showed a wonderful burst of speed, as
\\e\l as range and style, such^as is sel
dom seen In a field trial meet. When
extended, she runs like a greyhound,
and never lets up a moment when In
competition. She is conceded by Judge
Bell to be in the first flight, and fit to
run against the highest class dogs in
America. Her opportunities on birds
in this stake were limited, but she took
advantage such as offered and, taken
all in all, was in a class by herself.
Lady* was bred by W. W. Van Ars
dale of San Francisco and is by Cham
pion Count Gladstone out of the fa
mous Peach Marie She is a litter sis
ter to Mr. Van Arsdale's Peach Blos
som, which recently won the Illinois
champion stake In competition With
some of the best dogs in America. She
has now won seven times in trials.

the dogs failed to do any point work
and, after being down twenty-flve
minutes.during which Lady showed her
superiority in speed, range and style,
they were ordered up. 4 nd tn e awards
were announced by Judge Bell as fol
lows:
First, J. E. Terry's English setter,

setter. Kiigarif; third. W. W. Van

setters were cast off in an open coun

The field trial meeting was one of the
pleasantest in the history of the sport
on this coast, and good fellowship pre
vailed throughout. Judge Bell exerted
himself in a way which left no doubt
as to his earnest desire to place the
dogs in their proper places. How well
he succeeded Is shown by the total lack
of dissension, which so often mars thp
pleasure of field trial meets. Sportsmen
fanciers owe a debt of gratitude to him
for the. creation of new Ideals In the
perfect field, trial dog.
The last brace was W. S. Tevis' point
er dog Cuba of Kenwood, handled by
his owner, and C. S. Coggin's English
setter Mountain Quail, handled by her
owner. This brace was cast off in an
open field containing low cover, in
, which the scattered birds of a bevy had
j taken refuge. Cuba made three clever
i points and outranged his brace mate,
! which was in high flesh and not ln
j clined to overexert herself. Quail made
one stylish point and both dogs backed
well. After runlng thirty-three minutes

Libbio Candid back <>n the back stretch
and when making his move later found
he did not have the horse under him to
do thj turn.
â¢ Eleven ordinary' platers started in

over Milas. Lapidus and McGyle. The
unexpected happened, for Fille d'Or, a

by the Montana millionaire J. A. Mur

quiet tip out on the mare and she was
especially well flayed for the show. In
her previous race she did not show
srpeod onough to catch a street car. but
ytstcrday ran away from her company,
winning in a romp from My Surprise,
the second choice. Rosebud was third.
SAtX OF TARSUS OFF BADLY.
Tommy Burns appeared unable to get
the favorite. Saul of Tarsus, to br*>ak,
being a-.v*y so poorly that he had no
chance. In the past it was always dif
f cult to prevent Saul from beating the
gate.

course. Favorites took three events,
and the books laid up little money.
Old Mount McGregor II, which was a
two-year-old when King Rameses of
Egypt was being taught the art of roll-
Ing a brown paper cigarette, came
down from the Burns & Waterhouse
ranch on a visit, and by way of pas
time started in the third number on the
card. The ring showed no respect for
age and chalked up 6 to 1 against his
r.ame. the smart money all going in on
Cousin Carrie, the favorite. Only the
stupidity of Bell prevented the number
of Mount McGregor from being exhib
ited first. He took the rail position
away from Cousin Carrie soon after the
start, and then, with the race well in
hand, let Kunz slip through the last
f.fty yards with the favorite and obtain
a nose decision. The show went to Rus
tic Girl.
Gold Money, the crack sprinter from
t"he stable of Walter Jennings, captured
tke eix-furlong handicap at Oakland
yesterday, and in so doing equaled the
coast record cf 1:12)4 for the distance.

looked as iÂ£ the three-year-old Rock

I noted. - Stocks are light. Borne special cream
eries are bringing 3Cc. but in a. small way. and
I few houses quote over 29c. The demand- Is
[ now good. But the advance has attracted the
(attention of the East, where the markets are
very weak and overstocked, and Chicago Is
sending numerous wires to this market, asking
for bids on any quantity, and It la feared that
the current Â¦ advance will lead to the importa
tion of large lines from the East.,

downward, but support was met. or. rather,
the selling, was discontinued. Movements for
the rest of the day wai desultory and scat
tered. There waa some absorption of L"aite<l
States SteÂ»l preferred and of Amalgamated
Copper, which seemed based on trade condi
tions, but , these movements were without ani
mation or Importance. The advance in Pacific
Mail was based on a supposition that th-Â«
withdrawal of competing steamers for use as
transports In case cf war between Russia and
Japan would increase the business of tho
company. The heavy influx of casn Indicated
by the preliminary estimates of the week'a
currency movements was accepted with lan
guid interest, ar.d the market closed barely
steady and Intensely dull. Estimates of the
receipts by the banks in the direct Â«preÂ«9
movement vary to -the extent of several mil
lions of dollars. The sub-treaaury operations
have yielded to the barJu $7. 412.000. and the
various estimates of the interior movement
indicate a total net gain in cash of $12. Â¦'Â»;Â»> 'Â« â¢>
to J15.C0O.O0O. The advance In foreign ex
change toward the goid-expert point under
these circumstance is not surprising. The De
cember foreign trade statement leaves no
doubt, however, that New York can rÂ«adlly
command more resources with evidence of any
need. Both the exports and tha excess of ex
ports over Imports for the month rise to record
figures, the trade balance in our fwor
amounting to ?36.9*4.CS4. An increase In tha
value cf Imports of upward of $10,0O0.0UO. com
pared with December of last year, contributes
materially to the result and marks the re
sumption of supply of the domestic dem&ni
by domestic products in place of formerly im
ported material.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
The apple market was in good shape for
fancy and choice stock and sales of fine Â»w
town Pippins packed in 3^-tler boxes were
reported at $1 60. For 4-tier packages of fancy
the top quotation was considered an extreme
figure. Common Apples continued plentiful and
dull.
APPLESâ $1Â©1 50 for fancy.* 50fiÂ»0c for
choice and 25040c for common.

The cool weather continued to check the lo
cal demand for Citrus fruits and trade in the
open market and at the auction rooms, where
the offerings were light, was very quiet. In
fact, yesterday was the dullest day experienced
in the market thus far this season. "Even
tke large sizes of Navel Oranges; which were
in comparatively small supply, were hard to
dispose of. and the top 'quotation was shaded.
At the auction sale 3 cars of Navels were sold,
as follows: Fancy. |1 50Â©l SO; choice. $1 25Â®
1 50; standards. 7."cÂ«$l 10. A steamer which
arrived from Mexico on the preceding day
brought up 321 cases of Mexican Limes and 17
crates of Pineapples.

Representative men of the.city.as
sembled at the Merchants' Exchange
yesterday afternoon in response to an
invitation issued by J. W. Byrne, James
D. Phelan and Willis E. Davis to con
sider the beautifying of San Francisco.
There was a good gathering of men
well known for their interest in the
city's welfare. James D. Phelan was
voted to the chair and explained the
scheme in view.
Mr. Phelad said that as there, were
many organizations looking to the mer
cantile and business improvements
that the new association would take
up the artistic side of the - city^s llf e
and provide plans by which this object
might be provided.
Improvements, he said, in the past
had been done in a haphazard manner
and without plan. D. H. Burnham,
Sculptor Augustus St. Gaudens and
Frederick Olmstead, Â«aid Mr. Phelan,
had made plans for the adornment of
Washington, D. C, and Cleveland, Ohio,
and it had been suggested that - such
services m'lght be secured for San Fran
cisco.
Mr. Burnham of Chicago, architect
,of the new Merchants* Exchange.Vnow,
under construction In this city, had
volunteered to undertake such work as
was necessary toward the beautifying
of the city as a labor of love. â¢
EUROPEAN CITIES MODELS.
Mr. Phelan said that the expenses
would have to be provided for - a trip
for the study of the sea and hill cities
of Europe, and especially those "cities
resembling San Francisco, and I then
artists, and architects here would be
consulted in the matter.;' . .
Mr. ; Burnham estimates . that "the
preparations will take fully a year.'. .
Mr. Phelan explained that among the
improvements suggested were a town
hall or auditorium where large gather
ings, conventions, concerts and fairs
could be held. ,
After the .matters were discussed a
committee on the % special/ subject of
improvements was* appointed, 1 consist
ing of William- Greer Harrison, W.'- A.
Bissell and Allan Pollok. It w ; as re
solved to name the organization "The
Association for the, Improvement <; and
Adornment of San Francisco." The ex
ecutive committee appointed , by Mr.
Phelan consists of ,W. A. Irwin, Wil
liam Greer Harrison, Allan Pollok, F.
W. Dohrmann and -Herbert B.'Law.
BOULEVARD SUGGESTED.
The committee will report at the next
meeting a programme of procedure, in
cluding-the methods^ which Â¦ the asso
ciation has adopted for^the furtherance
of : its 'purposes, ij'jtf. Â¦ Â¦- ' 'Â¦ J r
, Among .the most important improve
ments, suggested are ; wide J boulevards
running from* Market street, !the' Mis
sion and Van; Ness j avenue direct [. to
Golden i Gate Park - and ; a road around
the bay shore. The proper adornment
of Telegraph Hill will also be a matter
to be considered. .;.
There . were ' a number . of communi
cations received ifrom citizens advising
on the form of Improvement. ; One sug
gested an opera-house,': another the
construction" of an outdoor, amphithea
ter and another the extension of Market
street to the ocean; while another sug
gested and sent in the design for an
ornamental hotel for Asbury Heights.^

Yesterday was essentially an "at
home" dayâ exeept for those that were
calling. Cabs darted about the dis
tinctive districts with rare abandon,
and those who were cabless skipped
lively over the slippery Western Addi
tion crossings to escape an embarrass
ing collision. But it serves them right
if they did meet with mishap â they
who would fain to call without the dis
tinction of stalling a cab on the curb
ing. It is such a compensation to a
hostess!
â¢ â¢ â¢
Yesterday was also a day of "teas,"
for witness the following affairs: > â¢
Mrs. Thomas Morffew entertained
over two hundred friends â wholly In
formally, however, and not a note of
weariness crept Into the long gray
afternoon. To entertain a continually
recurring coterie of guests is a tax
upon ' the resources of the cleverest
hostess. Mrs. Morffew has acquired
that art. ':?.:'.
In the receiving party were her sis
ters, Mrs. California Newton and Mrs.
Hodgson, who were gowned smartly
in imported white robes, as also was
the hostess.
Roses, pink and white, garlands of
green and dainty shades made a
charming setting for the stunningly
gowned women who, thronged the
rooms during the -fashionable hours.
Mrs. H. P. Pinney held an informal
reception yesterday at her home- in
honor of Mrs. Mary Hart, the clever
club woman from the land of the mid
night suiV Mrs. Hart was presented to
the members of the Women's Pacific
Coast Press Association ' at the func
tion, and a heart-to-heart talk ensued
about the mysterious land In the north.
Mrs. Hart goes on next week to the
exposition at St. Louis as a Commis
sioner from Alaska.
A rarely pleasant "at home" was
given yesterday at the home of Mrs.
W. E. F. Deal and the Misses Deal, on
Sacramento street, when the following
ladies assisted in receiving the large
number of callers: Mrs. Thomas H.
Nichols, Mrs. C. H. Hilbert. Miss Clo
tilde Mason, Mrs. John R. Wilson, Miss
Emma Moff at, Miss Henrietta MofCat
and Miss Marie Bull. .
On Monday next Miss Alice Treanor
will entertain In honor of two brides
to-be, Miss Katherine Selfridge and
Miss Mabel Donaldson.
The Daughters of the California Pio
neers will give an afternoon's enter
tainment to their friends on Monday.
The Gayety Club has announced its
next Â¦ dance for Wednesday, the 20th,
at the home-of Miss Christine Pomeroy!
Miss Pomeroy is a leader among the
dainty debutantes and the dance at her
home should materialize' as a real
"gayety" dance..
Wednesday brings the two large
luncheons of the week, Mrs. Ritchie
Dunn's, at the University Club, and
Mrs, M. Kirkpatrick's at the Palace.
On Friday the Fortnightlles will
gather in their stunniest frocks the
feminine faction, and the men are al
ready engaged for the choice dances.

"AT HOMES"
HOLD ATTENTION
OF SOCIETY FOLK
School Overcrowded.
School Director Boyle visited the
Lafayette SchoÂ«l yesterday morning
and found it to be overcrowded. , One
class of forty pupils has been meeting
In the hallway. .On his recommenda
tion a portable schoolroom will be
added to the building.
Just seven days before death ended
the eventful life of Mary E. ("Mam
my") Pleasant she made a will be
queathing to Lyman M. and Olive E.
E. Sherwood, who caredfor her during
the last days of her life and at whose
home she died, all her property, and
the aged colored Woman in the .will
gives as her reasons for so disposing of
her estate the fact that the Sherwoods
had taken such good care of her In
the winter of her life- and that she
had promised them that when she died
her property would go to them in
equal shares. The document was filed
for probate yesterday and with it was
filed by Sherwood a petition for the
admission of the will to probate.
The will bears date of January 4,
1904. The aged colored woman
died on January 11. The opening
clause of , the will contains the state
ment that "Mary E. Pleasant, being of
sound and disposing mind and mem
ory, declares the document to be her
last -will and testament." The second
clause declares that "she is unmar
ried and has no known living relative
who has any claim upon : her estate."
The fourth clause states that the testa
tor in making her will bears in mind
the fact that Lyman Sherwood, the
lawyer, and Olive E. E. Sherwood, his
wife, had rendered her great service
during the last days of her life and
also the fact that she had promised
them to leave them her property. In
the fifth clause she xievises to the Sher
woods all that she dies possessed of,
share and share alike, and in the sixth
and final clause of the document she
appoints the devisees executor and
executrix of the will^to serve without
bonds, and gives them power to dis
pose of the estate'as they see flt.with
out asking the consent of any court.
The will is a written document and
bears the | signatures of Thomas S.
Scott and August Roehncke as wit
nesses.
Keports from all over the coast Indi
cate prosperous conditions and in
creased interest in public library work.
New placer, for public reading are be
ing established, and others already
founded are increasing their facilities.
In Spokane, Wash., nine competitive
plans have been presented for the Car
negie library building, for which the
donation is $75,000. The library board
has submitted these to Professor W. R.
Ware, the eminent architectual author
ity of Columbia University. New York,
for hi? decision as Jo which is the most
satisfactory one of those coming within
the allowed expenditure. Professor
Ware's fee for' his expert opinion is
$250. The Seattle library board some
time ago enragÂ«xl his professional ser
vices for th^ir $:V>o.O0fÂ» building.
The Board of Tra-de in Ashland, Or.,
has appointed a committee for provid
ing permanent quarters for the public
library.
The State Library Trustees of Cali
fornia at their regular monthly meet
ing on January "> considered the propo
sition of Librarian GilEs for an exhibit
to be made at the St. Louis Exposition.
Part of the exhibit, if made, will con
sist of views of the Capitol and its in
terior, lists of the valuable works
owned by the library, Msts of the libra
ries of California and a sample travel
ing library of those now being circu
lated from the State library-
TRAVELIXG LIBRARIES.
This is in line with the efforts made
by the school authorities for a strong
representation of the educational ad
vantages of the State. An early deci
sion concerning the proposal will be
made. At the same meeting authority
was given Librarian Gillis to prepare
fifty additional traveling libraries for
general use.
The Beale Memorial Library at Ba
kcrsfield reports a large increase in the
use of reference and scientific works.
Santa Rosa's new library building,
costing $20/>00, will be ready for occu
pation in a few weeks.
Confident that their application to
Mr. Carnegie for a gift for a library
building will be successful, the Chico
< itizens have secured an excellent site,
convenient to both business and resi
dence d*tricts. for their hoped for li
brary mme. The deed for the site has
been delivered.
Nevada City has reason to be proud
of its young library, which was estab
lished only eighteen months ago. The
annual appropriation for its support Is
51500, though the assessed valuation of
Nevada City is but $925>000. This is the
most liberal support in proportion to
the wealth given to any public library
in the State.
CITIZENS RAISE MONEY.
The citizens raised money with which
to purchase a lot and small building for
the present use of the library, and are
looking forward to larger accommoda
tions if their application to Andrew
Carnegie is favored.
Delay in letting the contract for the
140,000 Berkeley library building is
caused by the proposal to substitute
stone for the plan of a brick basement
ptory. The increased cost will be about
51600. The library trustees have not
decided the question of having corner
stone ceremonies.
The Los Angeles public library In
tends to install a time clock, such as is
used in many largÂ£ libraries and in
mercantile houses. It will accurately
record when each of the flfty-flve at
tendants, except the librarian, goes to
vork. when each leaves and when each
returns. So great is the increase in the
use of the Juvenile department In the
library that it can no longer be con
ducted on "open" pystem. Only the at
tendants will hereafter handle books
for delivery, as is done in the fiction de
partment.
