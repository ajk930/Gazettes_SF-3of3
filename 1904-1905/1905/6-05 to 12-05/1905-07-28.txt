Interesting Figures Given Out

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALX. BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. July Â£7.â The Bureau of
Commerce and Labor to-day announced
that if American merchants should de
termine to' boycott Chinese importations
pending the existence of the boycott
against American goods by Chinese mer
chants it would maka quite a hole in
China's foreign trade. The latest figures
collected by the Bureau of Statistics of
the department show that in the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1905, the United
States bought from China, including the
port of Hongkong for which separate
ligures are made, merchandise to the
value of $30,000,000. We sold in the same
period to China and the distributing
port of Hongkong about $63,000,000 worth
of goods. The bulk of the goods we pur
chased from China is not of a kind
v.hich is among the necessities of life
and it would probably not be difficult to
transfer a preponderance of that trade
to Japan if it should be determined to-re
taJk'te.
The principal imports from China dur
ing ti?e pa#t liscal year wvre. hide*-and
skins, -$2,5240E9; silk, raw, $5,549,068; silk,
manufactu&l, 5266.464; tea $5,562,531;
other merchandise. $10,578,052. In the same
period we bought from Japan $60j000,Q00
worth of raw and manufactured silk and.
about $7,000,000 worth of tea." Tea can
also be obtained from Ceylon, Java, Bot
neo and other places, so that China has
no comer on the supply.
Some doubt Is expressed In official cir
cles whether It will' be possible to ob
tain China's consent to another treaty
with the United States providing for the
exclusion of Chinese laborers from this
country. The State Department Is aware
of ill-feeling throughout China and now
that the immigration treaty with China
ha# been allowed to lapse without the
negotiation of a new agreement, reports
have reached here that China is Inclined
hereafter to refuse to sign any similar
convention.
China's position appears to be that the
exclusion of Chinese citizens from a
friendly country is in itself a disgrace,
and while she cannot ignore the laws of
a foreign power providing for such ex
clusion, she can refuse to sanction it or
become part of it by concluding a treaty
involving such restrictions. A year ago
it is said it would have been easy to
conduct negotiations with China for the
exclusion of Chinese laborers only. Now,
however, it is understood the Chinese of
ficials are disposed to regard the signing
of such a treaty beneath the dignity of
their Government. The reason for the
assumption at Peking of this new atti
tude is not quite clear to the ofncilas here,
though in some circles it is attributed to
the influence of foreign powers.
PROPOSE TO BOYCOTT BANK.
Chinese About to Flifht American
Financial Institution.
SHANGHAI. July 27.â The native
bankers here are calling a meeting to
discuss the proposal to boycott the In
ternational Banking Corporation.
The International Banking Corpora
tion was organized In June, 1901, under
the laws of Connecticut, having re
ceived its charter by a special act of
the Legislature. It was then the only
American banking institution formed
for doing business entirely in foreign
countries, with authority to establish
branches. The corporation was made
the agent of the United States Gov
ernment for the receipts of payments
to this Government on account of the
Chinese Boxer indemnity. The stock
holders of the corporation were care
fully selected from among the leading
American manufacturers, exporters and
importers of the United States. The
corporation was capitalized at $3,000.
000 with a surplus of $3,000,000. Among
the cities represented in the concern
\u25a0were-: New York. Boston, Cincinnati
Pittsburg. Dayton. Cleveland, Colum

Chicago and St. Louis. The Southern
snd, Pacific Coast cities were equally
well represented.

Jerome Is Determined to
Thoroughly Probe
the Matter.
Colonel Mann Will Be Asked
to Produce the Books of
His Company.
Epccial Dispatch - to The Call.
NEW YORK. July 27.â While Colonel
Mann of Town Topics was not called on
to appear before the District Attorney.to
day and he was not asked to produce the
books of the Es^ Ess Publishing Com
pany, one of his subsidiary concerns,
there is UttlÂ§, doubt that a demand, for
the production of these books may be
made ui>on him sooner than he expects.
Then it will be known whether he is a
better fighter than the District Attorney,
backed up by the powers of the j Grand
Jury. The reason for an inspection of
these books is to ascertain if; Judge
Deuel of the Special Sessions Court, who
has been shown to have been in ! the re
ceipt of a salary from Town Topics, has
any affiliation with the other publications
controlled by Colonel Mann. \
After Jerome has heard aya v full report
of what has been ascertained by Assist
ant District; Attorney Krotel more sub
penas will be sent out for. many persons
.who ; may be .In a j position to know of
some of . the transactions with which the
name of Town Topics Is connected. Some
of these .are paid to be. men .who. are; in
charge of the social news printed In some
of the daily newspapers,- for; the charge
has been made , that some j of , th.Q solici
tors . for ; . "Fads - and Fancies"" not only
told the : expected i subscribers that should
they buy the work they would be treated
with every courtesy in the columns" of
Town Topics, but .went further and said
they were In a position to have some of
the daily newspapers Influenced to that
end. V # */Ii \u25a0 . \u25a0 - --/ v-
There are one or two artists, also, who
are said to know much of the inner
workings of Town Topics, the getting of
subscribers for "Fads and j Fancies" and
the attempt to get others for "Homes
and Hobbies," another trork on similar
lines which was planned by Town Topics,
but which met with such a cold reception
from wealthy society persons that it was
dropped.
Any remarks that Colonel Mann had to
make about the Investigation to-day were
printed In the issue of Town . Topics over
his own signature. He said he would
have some more to say next week.' In
another part of the publication there is a
paragraph which recalls that the sub
scription. price for "Fads and Fancies"
was $1500 and Colonel Mann's declaration
that this was not an excessive price. It
tells of "The Birds of America," the
\u25a0work of Audubon^,: each copy of which
cost $1000. Although the prospectus for
this work was issued in 1827, the article
says the first copy was not published un
til three years later, and the last volume
did not come out until 1539. The entire
edition, it is told, cost $100,000.

LOUISVILLE, July 27. â The glory of
the famous Siamese, twins has been
eclipsed. Nature has seen fit . to per
petrate a freak that outdistances them
by leagues. Seven in a bunch, kicking,
rolling, crying, and drawing vigorously
upon the maternal font, a litter of
amalgamated kittens . was born here
last Monday. The mother is an old
gray cat owned by W. C. Nord. Twenty
eight perfect legs, seven equally per
fect heads and seven . tiny tails that
wag ceaselessly make a composite of
feline life that it would be hard to
duplicate. \u25a0
The kittens are all united and they
present the appearance of a mottled,
furry bair possessed of some animating
principle 'and manifesting the heads of
a monster, and legs enough for, a centi
pede. Five of the kittens are black
and two are gray.

;Al ichael g Logue of , 234 g Sickles avenue.

of the accident. He says the woman was

neer, Hallock Bromley, blew, a long blast

\u25a0The; encine was reversed, but .too late

to. a standstill; an almost .unrecognizable
mass: of . flesh- and , clothing was; drawn

When the body, was taken out the upper

features were unrecognizable. There was
a deep gash in the left shoulder, another
over the right hip: and the left foot was
severed at the instep. \ Patrolman A. M.

the statements of Logue and the watch

Morgue. AUpon arrival ; there ,. an immedi
ate "\u25a0* search . was made ". by i the i Coroner's
men, but no mark or card gave a clew

handbag was a black purse : containing

A half punched shoe-polish f ticket was
also found, but inquiry, at the store failed

Officials Believe America

QUESTION FOR SENATE
Existing Trade Arrangement
Between the Two Countries
Will Lapse in November
* WASHINGTON, July 27. -^Germany's
commercial relations with the United
States will be among the most important
subjects to come before the Senate at
th<> next session of Congress. Having
negotiated n<Â»w commercial arrangements
with Belgium. Italy. Russia, Roumanla
and S<rvia, Germany is anxious to make
a similar convention with the United
States. The new treaties already con
cluded become effective on March 1 and
preliminary notice has been received
that the German treaty with this country
will be allowed to lapse about November
10. â¢ ':.'â¢-'\u25a0
A thorough understanding exists, how
ever, between Washington and Berlin
regarding the reasons for ending this
treaty. The matter has been discussed
at length by the President and Baron
Bpeck yon Sternburg. the German Em
basa<lor. the latter having communicated
Ormany's earnest wish to conclude a
new treaty with this country which will
be equally helpful to the trade of each
country. Upon his return to Washing
ton In the autumn. Baron yon Stern
hurg will have full instructions for the
programe to be followed and upon his
proposals will depend in a measure the
policy to be followed by this Govern
ment.
The lapse of the treaty coming late In
November, it is believed, will bring the
subject to consideration by the Senate.
Because of the effect upon American ex
ports, which without a treaty will be
obliged to pay the maximum rates of
the German tariff, the officials here be
lieve the Senate will consent to the rati
fication of a treaty, which, in return for
certain reductions on German imports,
\u25a0will give advantageous schedules to
American goods entering Germany.

NEW ORLEANS. July 27.â A1l the
forces engaged In the battle against the
yellow fever scourge to-day joined in
expressing the belief that while the situ
ation has been and is serious, enough
success has j already been achieved .to
justify the hope that for the nr?t time
in the history of the country .what
threatened to be a malignant epidemic

of yellow fever will be stamped out be-~
fore the frost comes, and that New Or
leans will be spared the horrors of pre"-
vious epidemics. ; -
With the cases reported to-day, the ag
gregate tince July 13 runs close to 200.-
These are included in twenty to twenty
five districts, including the \u25a0 sections
around the French market, where tbo
fever first appeared and where a large
proportion of the fatalities have oc
curred. This section runs from Saint
Ann to Barrack street and from Chartres
to the river, including about forty
blocks. Italians here are prone to avoid
physicians, and the fever got' a foot
hold in the district before it became
known to the authorities. No precau
tions were taken to destroy the mosquito
and the scourge spread with great rapid
ity. From the cheap and crowded lodg
ing houses the Italians who could get
away fled, some going to friends in other
sections of the city, some by rail to sur
rounding towns, and some to settlements
along the coast. The result is the ap
pearance of cases of fever in various
parts of the city, but principally below
Canal street in neighborhoods of ;the
poorer clases. Almost every Instance of
a new focus outslde-of the French market
district is that of an Italian who es
caped therefrom or of some one of a
different nationality whose business was
in the section.
FIFTY ON THE DEATH LIST.
Ab far as the health .authorities were
able to discover to-day, no case has thus
far developed from outside of any of the
fully infected districts and with a very
few exceptions the deaths have been
among the Italians. Illustrating this
fact, a report for 2* hours made officially,
by the State board shows thirteen cases
and six deaths, nearly all of them being
Italians. This brings the total number
of deaths to 50. ; '
A great cleaning up has begun. Every
ward has been thoroughly organized
with precinct organizations . radiating
from. the major body.- ':\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0; ' j
"Cleaning up streets and remoytng 'dirt
from gutters is energy all thrown away,"".
declared President Konke of the v^.ty-
Board of Health to a committee of citi
zens who called to consult him on the
\u25a0subject. "Screen cisterns and drain
standing water from premises where it
abounds," said he.
The Emergency Hospital, which has
been fitted out for the care of yellow
fever patients, was in full operation to
day. It is in an old three-story building
in the rear of the French quarter, 'me
hospital will be operated at its full ca
pacity, patients being removed to it from
all sections of the city in a screened am
bulance, which has already been pro
vided. ; . ; .
A vi6it to the French market section
to-day gave little visible evidence of the
serious epidemic that has prevailed in
that cuarter. Two weeks of hard work
by the public cleaning gangs showed in
the eeneral cleanliness of the surround
ings, but there was no excitement among
the residents. \u0084 â¢ â¢ .
Every avenue of egress from the city
has been closed by the rigid quarantine.

OF GIIOSS FIiAUDS
Declare That Corporation
Is Insolvent and That an
, Accounting Should Be
Made to Interested Parties
NEW ...YORK, July . 27.â 1n the form ot
an amended complaint to a bill filed last
April, suit was \u25a0 begun to-day In the
United States Circuit Court for the
Southern New York. District to throw
the entire Â»421,(K"0.0u) of the assets of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society into the
hands of rtceivers, who snail '"take pos
session of all the funds, asset 3 and prop
erty held by the defendant society of
every character and description' and ad
minister the same aa they may be di
rected by the court." c .'\u25a0
"More than forty policy holders in the
Equitable, representing a dozen different
States, are included as complainants in
the prtesnt suit, w.i.cn.la based in part
upon the allegation that the society has
no funds with wmch to meet its enormous
losses, and is insolvent.
With J. Wilcox Brown of Maryland, the
holder of a Jio.OOO policy, as complainant,
papers were filed last, Aril to compel a
distribution of . the $54,000,000 surplus fund
of the society, to compel the manage
ment to make an accounting to the policy
holders, and for the appointment of re
ceivers for the surplus fund, pending
judicial ascertainment of the rights of the
policy holders thereto. Since the filing
of that bill permission has been obtained
to file an nmended complaint: Since the
original bill was filed, forty-four other
policy holders have intervened in the suit.
CHARGES "OK FRAUD MADE.
In the amended bill; which '* is .far
more sweeping in its .charges and? in.
its appeal fpr. relief than was the orig
inal billof last April, there are'.incor-"
porated many citations from' the Frlck
and Hendricks reports," published some
months later. .The bill 'alleges that the
society has been guilty,. 6f mismanage
ment in syndicate transactions, that
"unreasonable and \ excessive" salaries
have been paid, and that "large sums
of money, ranging from $20,000 to $37.
000.000, belonging to the said : insur
ance funds of the society. Were allowed
by It to remain uninvested on deposit
in banks and trust companies without
adequate interest, in many of which"
banks and trust companies the said
-officers and directors of the society, or
many of them, were large. stockholders,
for^ the purpose of securing pecuniary
benefit to such directors individually;
and such undue-and unreasonable cash
hnbinces existed since at least the year
1900."' " '\u25a0 '' " " ' : '. ''''
After reviewing the purchase of the
Hyde ! stock by Thomas F.~ Ryan.- the
complaint denies the legality of the
election . of directors who are not
stockholders of the company. The com
plaint continues:
"The assurance funds held by the
society have been fraudulently and neg
lectfully handled and are being wast
ed and mismanaged, and lost to the
extent of many millions' of dollars.. It
is without a legally chosen board of
directors and the real value of the
property held by it is unknown and
speculative." - ...
. WOULD END ITS EXISTEIVCE.
Reverting to a statement that the de
fendant society "has willfully and neg
lectfully and fraudulently mismanged,
and. through its officers and agents, mis
appropriated' the said assurance funds,"
the complaint asserts that "the said de
fendant is wholly unable to repay the

was dismissed. The complainant's
orchard was suffering from thÂ« drought.
so resort was had to the Superior Court.
A writ of mandate compelling the de
livery of water was asked for.
Judgre \fray contended that, as the
writ was calculated to afford speedy re
lief and his decision would undoubtedly
be appealed from, its purpose would
miscarry, nml application should have
been made to the Supreme Court. This
was done. The Supreme Court decided
that there was a plain, speedy and ade

The application was denied.
While the legal mills are slowly

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; FRIDAY; JULY 1905.
Carlton Eefuses to Tell
of His Early
Declines to State How
fe Often He Was
Married.
Epeclai Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 27.â Questioned by
Inspector Cross concerning his career,
Frederick E. Carlton, 'Brooklyn's alleged
bluebeard, to-day refused point blank to
tell anything about his life prior to 1891
and defied the inspector to get any evi
dence that would convict him of any
crime. He told the Inspector he had te
tanus many years ago, which was â¢ his
explanation for knowing so much about
the disease.
It was the purpose of Inspector Cross
to find out whether Carlton had ever
cultured tetanus germs and . what he
knew about the germs in general. The
prisoner said he had tetanus as a result
of an injury to his hand resulting from
the explosion of a cartridge which he was
trying to hammer into a revolver.
The only statement- Carlton made con
cerninpr his early life was that he had
been educated in a high school and that
he snent two years in â¢ a preparatory
school fitting ' for college. Beginning
with 3891, which was, he said, the date of
his honorable discharge from the army,
he had lived in New York City. The
Carltcn who was in the army was born
in 1857, and the Brooklyn prisoner says he
is 35 years old.
Carlton told the inspector that he had
been employed in and near New York
City as a cook in restaurants. He de
clined to say how many times he had
bpen married, because, he explained,
there were divorce courts in Brooklyn.
He said he had boxes in three safe de
posit vaults, but would not say where
they were. The police might find tetanus
germs if they went to these boxes, he
said. :"-;: '\u25a0 .'â¢\u25a0:> 3> -\u25a0
During her illness, Carlton said, he in
jected morphine in the arm of Mary Gor
man Carlton, his second Brooklyn wife,
whose body was recently exhumed.
From 1902 to 1905 -Carlton was In the
navy, he said, and mentioned the ports at
which he stopped. He defied the inspector
to prove that he had been married dur
ing these years, except to two Brooklyn
women, both of whom died within a year
from tetanus. . \u25a0. Z^X,
Carlton was arraigned in the Adams
Street Court on a grand larceny charge
made by Henry Schaub, who alleges that
Carlton fleeced him out of , $700 in a real
estate deal. This is the only charge, on
which Carlton has been so far indicted.
An adjournment was taken â¢ until Au
gust 17.
Carlton was measured by the Bertlllon
system at police headquarters. The po
lice declare the measurement \u25a0 compared
identically with the measurement of Ed
ward M. Martinez sent by the Cincinnati
police.

nothing to confess except bigamy and

REFERENDUM IN ORDER
vote of People of Nonvay on
the Dissolution of Union
Favored by the Ministry
LONDON, July 27.â The BriUsh chan
nel fleet will sail for the Baltic Sea on
August 20 and will remain there through
September. As it has been several; years
since a British fleet appeared in the Bal
tic Sea, the announcement . Is connected
in the public mind with Emperor Wil
liam's recent tour and the visit of a
German squadron to Scandinavian wa
ters. The' cruise of the British fleet is re
garded as designed to counteract the pre
ponderance of German influence in Scan
dinavian politics. â¢
The Admiralty,^ however, discourages
the Idea of politics having any bsaring on
the cruise and says that the" Baltic is an
open sea and that the .fleet is simply
going there to execute maneuvers, a
ceremonious visit not being contemplated.
CHRISTIANIA. Norway, July 27.â The
Norwegian Government to-day proposed
to the Storthing the holding of a - ref
erendum on the dissolution of the union
with Sweden. The proposal was referred
to a special committee. The vote will
probably be taken on August 13.
STOCKHOLM, Sweden, July 27.â 80 th
houses of the Swedish -Parliament to
day approved the report of the special
committee appointed by Parliament to
deal with the crisis between Sweden and
Norway. In the first chamber the re
port was adopted without debate.
In the second chamber the recommenda
tion in the report regarding negotiations
for a dissolution was adopted unani
mously, but there was some objection to
the proposed loan of $25,000,000 to meet the
new conditions. About, a* score of mem
bers voted against the loan, the Social-
Democratic leader, Branting,- pointing out
the danger of militarism and declaring
that the proposed loan was contrary to
the political spirit of the recommenda
tion to negotiate. It was a dangerous
precedent, he said, for . never
heretofore had borrowed money for mili
tary purposes and he feared . Norway
would regard it as being In the natuie of
a threat of war.
This view was contested by other

CARBONDALE, Colo., July 27.â Grave
apprehension exists here for the safety
of Charles Henry Yallalee. a young
New York broker, who came to Colo
rado several weeks ago to spend the
summer. A week ago last Sunday Yal
lalee, who had been stopping at one of
Eugene Grubb's cow camps, ten miles
northwest of Carbondale. saddled his
horse and announced that he was going
for a ride. That was the last seen of
him at the camp. He did not call at
Grubb's ranch, as was his custom, nor
has anything been seen of,- his mount.
For several days the people at . the
camp paid little attention to Yallalee's
absence, but now, learning that he has
not been seen by his friends, they have
become alarmed and fears are enter
tained that he has either met with foul
play or accident.
Yallalee left all his clothing and per
sonal belongings .at the camp. The
horse he rode belonged to the woman
who cooks at the camp. Yallalee was on
the point of buying a horse from Grubb.

to Colorado for an outing and carried

BKRLIN. July 27. â In view of the prob
ability of aa early peace between Rus-
Eia and Japan, t&e terms of which will i
probably involve the payment of a very
heavy indemnity by Russia, the flnaa
ciers of Europe have been holding con
ferences to the end that tbe indemnity
may be paid without seriously disturb

about to send their represeatatives to
New York with a view to enlisting the
co-operation of the larger financiers of

Russian loan for the purpose of paying
the indemnity will be scattered and taai
a considerable portion will be taken in

Captured. :
TOXIO, July 27. â It is officially re
! ported that a Japanese detachment

troops in Saknalien Island, dislodged
! the enemy from j Alkova and vicinity,
! occupied thÂ« "first line "ef defenses at
i Polovia azid tae second at Alkova on
July**. .
The Russian strength consisted of
i oae battalion of iafantry. recently dis
j patched to the scene, besides several
| hundred volunteers, with eight field
, piece* from Alexaadrovsk placed oa the
i nills in the direction of Luikoof.
Before this,' oae detachment of Jap
anese iafaatry. dispatched under the
protection of torpeao-boats toward tae
pier at Alexandrovsk, dispersed a body
of Russians who were attempting to
bt;rn the pier, which was captured in
tact. >
A detachment, helped by a torpedo- ]
boat, landed at Mugati, dislodged th.e \\
Russians and captured 40.000 toas of |
coal and light railway materiaL Aa- \
other detachment occupied tbe third |
line of defenses at Alkova on tae &azae |
afternoon. * Continuing the advance, j
Aiexandrovsk was taken and entered oa j
the same evening: after some resistance. J
The Russians continued their resistance j
at the redoubts east of the town and on j
aa emiaeace tp the northeast. Stubborn I
resistance was offered aad the fighting j
did not cease from sundown to dawn, j
the Russians holding their positions j
east of Alexaadrovsk. The Japanese j
thea attacked, pressing the Russians
toward Novomieha-elakao and complete- :
ly ocenpyiag that place.
Alexandrovsk escaped being destroy- j
ed by a coaaa^ratioa. Two hundred \
prisoners were taken.- Oan carriages.*
ammunition and provisions were also -
captured. â¢
The admiral's report, which was re- i
tbe successful landing of the Japanese j
forces in the vicinity of Alexaadrovsk, |
on Eaghaliea Island, s^J's that the piers
at AJexaadrovÃk, Niyomi and Mukake
were found undestroyed. but the enemy
had set fire to Mumika, aad Alkowawas
still burning- The town of Alexan
drovsk was not burned. j
The Admiral's report, which was re
cefred at 7:30 p. no. on July 24, says that
the Japanese flag was hoisted over the
government buildings' at Alexandrovsk
without any loss oa the part of the Jap
anese force.
WAAT VLADIVOSTOK .VECTBAL.
Japanese May Demand It mm <Part of
Peace Arrangement.
WASHINGTON, July 27.â As a clearer
idea is gained of Japan's peace terms,
the skepticism with which Washington
received the European reports that
Japan would demand the neutralization
of Vladivostok is lessened. In fact, it
Is learned that not' only is this .likely
to j constitute oae of Japan's . demands,
but It may.be accompanied. by, a start
ling counter proposal. In effect, ac
cording to seemingly well-informed
sources, Japan*^will propose in "return
for the neutralization -of this last P.us
sian fortress on the Pacific - not *to
fortify Port Arthur. Should this .'ln
formation prove correct, it will change
entirely the view which has prevailed
in \ official circles that the question of
Vladivostok's neutralization . could not
reasonably be made a part of Japan's
peace price.
It is pointed out that while the war
has demonstrated that Port Arthur was
a military blunder, nevertheless this
great fortification constitutes a tre
mendous political influence in the Far
Eastern question and its 'abandonment
as a stronghold is a concession of such
magnitude that it is not felt that Rus
sia can afford to refuse to recognize
it. On the other hand, the sacrifice
would cot be as great as appears at
first glar.ee because the fortification, of
the Straits of "Korea would off set the
loss . of JPort Arthur as a strategic
point. * \ -_ . - t
It is believed here that"- the question
of Vladivostok will prove to be one of
the most difficult which the conference
will face, as Russia has not concealed
her disinclination to permit 'it to enter
into tbe negotiations.-
In this connection an interesting
story Is current In. diplomatic circles
regarding the. selection of Baron Ko
mura as Japan's. chief plenipotentiary.
According" to this story, 'Japan had
hardly less trouble' than did Russia in
finding an official willing- to undertake
this delicate mission. Baron Komura
was finally induced to accept it with
the stipulation that before the confer
ence assembled the following things
should be done: First, the notation of a
new loan In order that Japan should
be prepared to continue the war in the
event the effort for peace should -fail;
second, the occupation of the island of
Saghalien; third, an advance against
Vladivostok; and last.,, that Oyama
should start a decisive blow at the
Russian army In Manchuria.
â¢The fact that the first three stipula
tions have been fulfilled, while advices
from the front indicate. the Imminence
of a general engagement; would indi
cate that, the, story is well founded.

west how to municfpaliie its street rail
ways after the Glasgow method it was
expected that Robert Crawford, former
Tows Councilor cf Glasgow, woald ac
company him. Illness, however, prevent
ed Crawford from doing so. But his
visit has only been postponed. ' He ex
pects to make a tour cf America, lectur
ing on ""Maaicipal Socialism aad Its
Practical Working in Glasgow."
For naany years a wholesale dry goods
merchant in Glasgow, no other man has
been more . jfrominenUy identified with
the 'progress of its various municipal
enterprises. He has filled, several civic
offices there .with rignal abilityâ always
be it noted without payâ and has been
in the fronts of the various movements
which have culminated in making: Glas
gow the best example of a city ran hoa
estfy for the benefit of Its people that
can be f onad anywhere, . Civic improve
ment is more than a hobby with him â
It is a passionâ and he has spoken oa
it la every part of the United Kingdom.
Wherever a town undertakes a figat
for public benefit a* opposed to private
profit Crawford c&a be counted oa to lead
a hand. And he bopes to be able to help
along the same cause In America.
In the course of an interesting letter
explaining why he could not accompany
DalrynipJe to Chicago, he says: "I prefer!
dealing with broad principlesâ apart if !
possible from the hurly burly of the fight ;
over concrete Instancesr-that are con- j
censed ia the question of the public owa- \
ership of municipal services and util- ]
ities. I am of the opinion that a. very;
big war is now impending In, America
over tbe vast Question of principle, .aad '
as I have always seen very clearly and '
felt very intensely oa this subject 1 1
would like to strike America at the ris-j
lag of the wave and do my best, to send
it triumphantly forward. I have the most j
absolute confidence in the power of the j
American people to "realize' themselves.
aad to rise to a great effort as soon as j
they see that the thing ought to be
takea !p hand. . . . â¢ '\-
"I am an ardent believer ia that phase
of socialism called mnnicipalization, and
have always been intensely interested
In the growth and development of the
capacity an.desire.of people of one com

selves for communal ends. I see no limit
to the possible good to be done in this
way provided that good, honest, capa
ble mea are, found with civic patriot
ism enough to serve 'their fellows with
out fee or reward In carrying on these
public services as part of their duty to
the community among ~whom they live.
"So long as the aim 'of civic govern
ment Is clean, the tone high, the ideal
lofty an dtae object is to foster and cre
ate better conditions "of life for every
citizen alike, high or low; Tich or poor

tioned the witness at length, tending to
show If an oath was Improperly made it
would not constitute perjury and the
witness read and explained the clauses
of the California code bearing' upon the
offense of perjury. During the exami
nation many discussions ensued be
tween Collins and the witness in which
Collins sought to belittle the Assistant

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Prevent
As Well As Cure
Headache
If subject to headache, take
. Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills when
you feel the first indication of
â¢ an attack, and you will find
that they rarely ever fail to
stop further progress.
Pain weakens the nerves, and
the longer you suffer, the more
frequent will be the attacks.
On the contrary, if the
nerves are relieved of this
weakening influence, the at-
tacks will be less frequent, and
finally disappear altogether.
Dr. : Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
contain no opium, cocaine, mor-
phine or chloral in any form.
They are absolutely harmless
if taken as directed, and will
have ro other effect, except to
tlrive out the pain.
"Dr. Miles* Anti-Pain Pills* are all
right, and 1 can recommend them to
eny one In need of a remedy for head-
ache, neuralgia, or pain of any kind,
ily health is not very good, and I am
itubject to frequent attacks of severe
headache, but since I began taking:
Dr. Miles* Anti-Pain Pills I do not
suffer from that trouble as I used to.
They never fail to give relief in a few
nlnutes. and if taken promptly on thÂ©
approach of headache will prevent an
attack from coming on. Pain Pills
prevent, as well as cure."
MRS. WM. PEDRICK, ,

WATER RUSHES
OVER TRACKS
Southern Pacific Traffic Will
Be Tied Up Unless the
Salton Sink Floods Drop
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July. 27.â Complete
cessation of the train service threatens
the Southern Pacific : .through the' en
croachment of the flood waters of the
submerged Salton sink upon its* main
line near Salton. To-night the water
is running over the ties for a distance
of more than a mile- arid- a" wind from
the southwest would pile the water en
tirely over the. rails,, making the pas
sage of trains impossible. . - ' . -
The water is steadily rising in spite
of all efforts to stop . Its' pouring-, in
from the Colorado '.River -and to-day, 'a
rise of two inches was reported, at ;the
offices of the Southern Pacific for the
preceding twenty-four'hours. \u25a0 ,
The' railway : company has 'rushed
every available man to the spot, -where
it is building. a "shoo-flyy track ten'
miles , in length about, the; threatened
section. It will be a week. before this
temporary track on higher. ground. will
be 'completed .and it is- feared, that be
fore the connections ;can be made "the
rising \%aters will have made 1 the main
line Inoperative. . * \u25a0 . .-\u25a0
General Superintendent Ingram has
removed his headquarters to the seat
of the 'trouble and will not leave until
the crisis has passed^ 'For nearly two
weeks it has been known that the rail
road track was in danger and the com
pany "has had more t {fan fa thousand
men at work building. embankments of
earth-filled sacks. As long as there
was no wind the danger was at a mini
mum, but during a few hours yesterday
a stiff southwest gale lashed the-wa
ters of the Salton Sea into High waves,
many of which dashed "over, the tracks.
â¢ It may take two'weeks.morie to close
the gap. at "the Colorado River, .where
the water is pouring* into that
stretch of country which is be
low the level of - the 'sea. But
for -the enormous evaporation ' the
water would have covered the -railroad
tracks long ago. The .water at. present
covers a district nearly forty miles long
and averaging ten miles in width.

shape for the consideration of .Admiral
Goodrich. With the report of this board
in hand the admiral will decide .whether
or not to appoint a board of inquiry.
â¢At 10 o'clock this morning this board of
investigation, consisting of Lieutenant
Commander F. W. Bartlett, Lieutenant
Commander, Halstead and Lieutenant
Moody, convened on board the flagship
and -after consultation with the admirai
adjourned to the Bennington. The report
of the board. is not expected for. several
days. In the meantime the work of clean
ing ud the gunboat proceeds slowly, the
boilers Icing left in the position in which
they were found after the explosion until
inspected by th? investigating board.
Divers have plugged; the intake pipes
from the outside, thus stopping the Inflow
of water. Thus far it is reported that
the divers have found nothing wrong
with the hull from the outside. Scalings
from the boilers will be examined by the
navy yard chemist, it is understood,., to
determine If gases created by corrosion
and chemical action caused the explosion.
.There have been no deaths since those
reported last night, though the condition
of P. â¢ Nieman, H. A. Worthen' and L. A.

BERKELEY, July 27.â For four days

for the Order of Americans, who was

train at Lorin last Saturday morning, has
remained at the local morgue in charge
of Deputy Coroner Btreightif, while rel
atives of Berger, representative* of fra
ternal orders and undertaken; have con-
tended for possession of the corpse. The
argument became so strenuous at vari
ous stages that resort to personal vlo

to civil and police authorities.
Undertaker Jarr.ee Flnney of Oakland

Deputy Coroner Streightif had supposed
that the Berkeley lodge of the Knights of
' Pythias would take charge of the body,
and so he communicated with Chancellor
Commander A. C. Wright, James Carpen
ter and Dr. Condon, a special committee
appointed at the request of the Lincoln
(Nebr.) lodge to pay the lodge's tribute
to the dead here.
Incidentally Streightif demanded a fee
of ?25 for embalming the remains. Un
dertaker Finney refused to pay this fee.
In this connection the representatives of
the Order of Americans and the Fraternal
Brotherhood, who were present, declared
that those orders made no provision for
burial benefits.
As against this inability of the Ameri
cans and Fraternal Brotherhood to act
came the proposal or the Berkeley
Knights of Pythias to assume all charges
â¢ of undertakers, and inter the body Â«ither
here cr in Nebraska, as relatives might
desire.
The lodge men with Undertaker Finney,
demanded, however, that the body be
given to Finney, and Deputy - Coroner

Eued a warm argument between . under

The matter was referred to Coroner
Mehrmann, who decided that the corpse
should go to the representatives of the
widow, if the charges were paid. Finney
demurred to the payment of $25.
Streightif offered to permit the deposit
of the money with Commander Wright
of the Knights of Pythias here, and if
Coroner Mehrmann should 6ay the charge
TirÂ«ts excessive to abide by the latter" s
judgment. The controversy raged again,
ana Finney nnally made a trip to Oak
land, and after more argument gave
Streightif his money.
In his excitement Undertaker Finney
took the corpse to Oakland without the
necessary permit from the Health Officer.
He discovered his error last night, and
returned in haste to Berkeley. The doc

AGED CAPITALIST
MARRIES IN HASTE
William H. Betts Foils Daughter s Efforts
to Prevent the W/edding.
TAKES HIS HOUSEKEEPER TO WIFE
BERKELEY; July 27.â Fearing that his
daughter, Mrs. A. H. Mac Donald, might
succeed In preventing his marriage to a
woman whom he has known only a few
weeks. William H. Betts. 78 years old.
was wedded In haste to-day to Mrs. G.
Forsythe. The bride Is 47 years of age.
Mr. Betts Is a retired capitalist, who
made a fortune as a dealer In wagon
springs and hardware In San Francisco.
His first wife died on April 13, 1905. She
was nursed by Mrs. Forsythe. Since
that time Mrs. Forsythe has actea as
housekeeper for the venerable capitalist
at his home at 2505 Telegraph avenue.
News of his purpose to wed the house
keeper came a few days ago to Mr.
Betts' daughter, who is the wife of A.
H. Mac Donald of Berkeley. The daugh
ter considered the proposed marriage un
seemly. With her husband she pro
tested and begged that Mr. Betts defer
his nuptials at least one year from the
date of his first wife's death.
This Mr. Betts declined- to do. He is 78
years Old and not sufficiently optimistic
to suppose that there are a great many
years for him to live. He believed in
taking time by the forelock. He Vould
not wait.
Mr. and Mrs. MacDoneld decided to ap
peal to the courts to prevent the mar
riage. Last night in Oakland they filed
a petition asking to be appointed guar
dians of Mr. Betts. Mr. Betts at once
made a counter move and was married
this morning to Mrs. Forsythe.
The wedding took place at the home
of Mr. Betts' son, Percy Betts, at 3030
Tremont- street. I Rev. W. H. Scudder of
the South Berkeley Congregational
JChurch performed the ceremony. The
witnesses were Mrs. Percy Betts and
Mrs C. L. Rogers. The bride and groom
went at once to Mr. Betts' home on
Telegraph avenue. Their wedding trip
will be taken later.
. The Mac Donalds announced to-day that
they would press the legal phase of their
opposition to the wedding, and will seek
to have Mr. Betts declared Incompetent,
alleging as proof this wedding of the
aged man. They characterize his action
as that of an incompetent person.
AGED BBEWER'S, WIFE
SUES FOR FREEDOM
Mrs. Caroline Palmtag Says
Husband Has Been Cross
Five Years.
OAKLAND, July 27.â With not a
pleasant word spoken to her by her
husband for five years after thirty
years of life together, Mrs. Caroline
Palmtag, wife of Leopold Palmtag. the
rich Haywards brewer, has Instituted
divorce proceedings against him and
obtained an injunction restraining him
from transferring or disposing of any
of his property until her suit ha* been
adjudicated. She charges him with ex
treme cruelty and says that thoy. have
held no conversation, together for
months past and the only words ad
dressed to her by him have been op
probrious epithets.
Palmtag is part owner of what is
known as the Lyons Brewery at Hay
wards and is in partnership with his
wife's son, Charles. They have con
ducted the brewery for many years and
own it jointly, the plant being valued
at $500,000. Palmtag married Mrs.
Heyer in 1875, she then having three
sonsâ Charles. William and Julius.
Julius has since died, but the other two
are still living and Charles Heyer is
Mayor of Haywards. Two more chil
dren were added to the family as the
result of the union. They are Mrs.
Flora Strobel and Miss Lena Palmtag.
Charging her husband with extreme
creulty, Giacomina Perata of 1189
Union street has brought an action for
divorce against Antonio Perata, asking
for a division" of the community prop
erty, which she says is worth $6000,
besides a large amount of cash her hus
band is in possession of. She fays he
has often struck her and sworn at her
until she can put up with it no longer.
They have three children, of whom she
asks the custody and $100 a month
alimony for their support.
Charles Koerner brought suit for di
vorce against Adelaide Koerner to-day
on the ground'of 'desertion. They were
married here in February, 1904. and in
July of the same year, he alleges, she
deserted him.
TEACHERS' PENSION FUND.
OAKLAND, July 27. â The annual ac
count of the Alameda County teachers'
annuity and retirement fund was filed
with the Board of Supervisors to-day
by Superintendent T. O. Crawford. It

pose-the pensioning of teachers, $13,
740 25 has been paid in and that
$8235 14 has "been paid out, leaving a
balance of $5405 11.
The association began with a mem
bership of 228, but owing to a stam
pede among the teachers, caused by the
belief that if all the teachers in Ala
meda County could not be forced to
Join It would not be a success, eighty
three drew out and took with them
$5081. The association, however, with
its reduced membership is going on and
is looking forward to the day when
Oakland. Alameda and Berkeley will be
consolidated and contribution to the
association be made compulsory. vw

PLAN A NEW HOME
FOR BOARD OF TRADE
Central Location Is Desired
for "Boosting" Alameda
County.
OAKLAND, July 27.â The Oakland
Board of Trade is proceeding steadily
with its determination to have a build
ing of its own, one which will be the
headquarters and which will have room
for the headquarters of all of the
"boosting" that will be done for : this
side of the bay. , It is now announced
that the Board of Trade has gone so
far with its plans that it has bonded
the vacant property on the northeast
ern corner of San Pablo avenue and
Eighteenth street, and that the organi
zation will now take up the matter of
financing both the lot and a proper
building. The purchase price of the lot
will be $20,000, and it has a frontage
of a little less than nfty-flve feet on
San Pablo avenue by sixty-five feet on
Eighteenth street. The option was ob
tained by the special building com
mittee of the Board of Trade, which
consists of Hugh Hogan, W. J. Lay
mance, John T, Bell, C. J. Heeseman
and W. C. Jurgens, and it has been
formally* transferred to the Oakland
Board of Trade.
The Oakland Board of Trade is sadly
in need of proper headquarters. At
present it occupies rented quarters in
a store on Twelfth street. The plans
of the board will be to erect a build-
Ing that will contain a room for a
permanent display of the products of
Alameda County, with proper meeting
rooms, reception rooms and committee
rooms.
The "All Day for a Dollar" excur
sions that were started by Secretary
Steams of the Board of Trade are
bringing thousands of people to this
side of the bay every year, and it is
the desire to have some place to which
they can take these visitors and give
them a few moments' lecture upon tho
resources of the .county.

BIG REDUCTION
Southern Pacific Protests
to Assessments Taken Up
by Board of Equalization
LAND VALUES' LOWERED
Requests for Decreases to
the Extent of $205,000 Are
Taken Under Advisement
OAKLAND, July 27.â The Southern Pa
cific Company had its day before the
County Board of Equalization to-day and
got. Its assessments in this county mate
terially reduced. The largest reduction
made by tho board was on sixty-five acres
of land owned by the company where its
West Oakland yards are located. This
property had been assessed by Assessor
Henry P. Dalton at $200,000, and was re
duced from this figure to $75,000. it being
shown that of this amount of land fifty
acres of it had been assessed by the State
Board of Equalization, leaving but twen
ty-livfc acres for the county to assess.
The assessment of a thirty-four-acre
tract, upon which the Peralta-street
yards are located, was reduced from
$15,000 to $1, it being a double assessment.
A reduction - from $142,000 to $60,000 was
also asked on a tract of 102Â»Â£ acres, as it
is claimed fully ninety acres of it are
under water at high tide. The matter
was taken under advisement. This is a
portion of the Oakland water front,
which was so long in litigation.
A horizontal cut was asked on all the
ferry-boats plying on the bay, on the
ground that Assessor Dalton has assessed
Alameda County's Â»ialf of these ferries
at a higher figure than Assessor Dodge
has in San Francisco. The reductions
asked are on the Bay City, from $20,000
to $12,500; Encinal; from $25,000 to $22,500;
Garden City, from $12,000 to $9500; Newark,
from $45,000 to $37,500; Oakland, from
$45,000 to $30,000; Piedmont, from $35,000 to
$30,000; Berkeley, from $61,000 to $55,000;
Transit, from $20,000 to $15,000; Thorough
fare, from $20,000 to $15,000.
The assessment of $5000 on the Southern
Pacfic block system at Berkeley was re
duced to $5, as it was considered a part
of the system covered by the State's as
sessment.
The reductions on the ferry-boats were
taken under advisement by the board In
order that a careful examination can be
made of the matter. The 'entire reduc
tion granted the company by the board
to-day amounts to $145,000, and the board
has under consideration further reduc
tions asked for amounting to $205,000.
Other reductions cranted were H. M.
McKlnney on house, from $2250 to $1375;
Charles Katz on land at Pleasanton, from
$2725 to $600' E. N. Simmon on house at
Emeryville, from $-->00 to ' $1000; A. A.

Gold Piece Drops From Mat

Evidently Concealed It
ANOTHER LINK ADDED
Contradiction Given to the
Prisoner's Assertion That
He Had No More Money
OAKLAND, July 27.â Another ,link In
the incriminating chain which is slowly
being forged about John Schneider and
George AY. Blaker to hold them for the
brutal robbery of Thomas W. Cook, was
brought to light this morning In Schneid
ler's cell in the County Jail. While the
matron was turning over the mattress
in the cell of the alleged youthful foot
pad, a $10 gold piece slipped from a rent
in the ticking where it had been con
cealed, and fell jingling to the floor. ;
' Mrs. White at once notified the jailer
in charge of her discovery, and a
thorough search of the cell was made,
which resulted in the finding of a purse
hidden under the prisoner's cot. When
confronted with this evidence that he
had lied when he said that he had no
: money other than that which was found
in his pockets when he was arrested.
Schneider sullenly denied that the purse
or money was his property.
Sheriff Frank Barnet at once took the
purse and money, to Schneider's, home in
; East Oakland, and showing the purse to
the suspected youth's mother, asked her
if it was the property of her son. After
seme hesitation Mrs. Schneider said that
she thought the purse belonged to him,
and after she found that it contained $10
she became sure that her son owned it.
The finding of the purse and gold is a
flat contradiction of Schneider's declara
tion that he did not possess any money
except that found when he was arrested.
; At midnight Thomas _.W. Cook was still
alive, but It was announced that he might
die at any moment. .-â¢

WANT TO FORM
A NEW COUNTY
People of Mayfield and
Palo -Alto Are Dissatisfied
With^xisting Conditions
TWO PLANS .DISCUSSED
Next Legislature \Will Be
Asked to Solve Problems
Now bothering ' Residents
gpecial Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY. July 27.âConsider
able interest is manifest, here in tne
project, now well under discussion, to
create a new county with Palo Alto as
the county seat. or. failing in that, to
annex Palo Alto and Mayfleld to ban
Mateo County. Both schemes have ac
tive champions and both- have bitter
enemies, but from present indications
the. battle will be fought out at Sacra
mento at the next session. of the Legis
lature. \u0084
The suggestion for these important
changes has its source In a well-defined
dissatisfaction on the part of the people
of Palo Alto at the treatment they are
receiving from the Supervisors of Santa
Clara County. It is claimed that the
wholo northern part of Santa Clara, in
cluding Palo Alto and Mayfield, receive
scant financial recognition from their
-County Supervisors, and while the dis
gruntled districts, contribute largely to
the county treasury they cannot even
have their public roads kept in a good
condition.
Acting upon their disgust with super
visorial methods in Santa Clara, the
people of Palo Alto are prolific with
reasons why Palo Alto, Mayfield and
Stanford University should be in San
Mateo County rather than in Santa
Clara County. It is claimed that Adobe
Creek, and not San Francisqulto Creek,
is the natural county dividing line. Fur
thermore, if Palo Alto were in San Ma
teo County it would be only four miles
from Redwood City, the county seat,
instead of seventeen miles, as it now is
from San Jose, the county, seat of Santa
Clara County. A tremendous advan
tage, it. is claimed, would be gained by
the change. .-,.Â» \u25a0. â¢
, It Is certain, however, that the people
or Santa Clara County will not wiUing
i ly permit Palo Alto, Mayfield and S.tan
ford University to go, into San Mateo
County :md the issuo of a fight is only
problematical. Another; scheme, there
fore, has been suggested to. overcome
the difficulty. This plan is to create an
entirely new county, carved out of both
Santa Clara and San Mateo, to be called
the County of Stanford. This, also, is
sure to meet with opposition, as San
Mateo would be expected to sacrifice
\u25a0 Menlo Park to the new county, and
this, the politicians say. will never will
ingly be done. How the matter will
finally be arranged for presentation to
the Legislature is a matter of conjec
ture, but that it will be in some form is
accepted. as a certainty.- . " \u25a0

Supervisors Asked to Make a
New Road so as to Allow
Construction of a Big Dam
Special Disrated to ThÂ» Can.
â¢SAN RAFAEL, July 27.â 8y the fir*
of January, 1906, the residents of Corr-i
Madera, Larkspur, Escalle. KentHeM.
Ross. San Anselmo, Fairfax., San Rafael
and San Quentin will have a water sys
tem which will be unequaled in this
State. The poor water service in tha
three Irst-named places has deterred
many a homeseeker from building a
home on one of the many choice build
ing sites to be had there. As it Is now,
the residents have to economize in every
possible way to secure water enough for
cooking purposes, let. alone for other* pur
poses and then the water is not of the
best. In a comunicatlon addressed to
the Board of Supervisors of this county,
dated San Francisco, July 24, 1905. the
Marin County Water Company through
its secretary. A. Dalton Harrison, states
that "as the demand for a larger water
supply in Marin County is becomms so
urgent, the company feels it is its duty
to make immediate provisions to meet the
demand by the construction of a dam
at Phoenix Gulch at a point on tho
Bolinas road. About two miles from R033
Station. The company will be obliged
to use a portion of this road for the
dam, and It asks for the necessary per
mit. > .
Under a provision In their deed for a
right of way, dated June 28. IS7B, the
company reserved the right to use any
portion of the right of way whenever
necessary for dam purposes an dto give
the county a right of way at a higher
altitude, one that will not interfere with
the dam or reservoir. The company re
quests the supervisors* prompt atten
tion so that it can commence the work
Immediately in . order to catch the. win
ter's rainfall.
WORK TO BEGIN SOO^T.
The consideration of this communica
tion will be takeil up at thÂ«Â» next meet
ing of the Board of Supervisors. It will
no doubt be acted upon promptly and
favorably, so that the work can be com
menced.at an early date. It is proposed
to locate the dam at the Junction of Bill
Williams and Phoenix gulches. It will
cross the county road from Ross Sta
tion to Boltnas. .The grade is very steep
at this point, and it 13 proposed to build
an easier grade and a safer road. ' .
The proposed dam will be 300 feet wide
at the top and eighty feet high. The res
ervoir wilt cover an area of about
twenty-five acres and have a capacity of
from 160,000,000 to 175.000.000 gallons, which
is more than the capacity of Lake Lagun
itas. It will.be fed by spri'nga. JAs the
highest point) of the"d*anÂ» wiii'be jjhly J7O
feet above the sea level, the .company
will install a large pumping plant. The
water will be pumped Into a stand piÃe.
then through an aerator Into the stor
age reservoirs* at a higher leve>L â¢ The
reservoirs -will be at a sufficient eleva
tion to force the water by gravity to
almost any point. The company will run
its mains to Corte Madera. and furnish
the Inhabitants of that town with water
at the same rates charged San 'Rafael-
Ites. :-:Â£'.< .-
The contemplated improvements will
cost in the neighborhood of $150,000. The.
strip of road In question is about two
thousand feet long. ...
Supervisor V. J. B. Cheda, in whose
district the proposed dam will be con
structed, In an interview to-day said:
I hay examined the site for th*Â»
proposed improvements. I find that tho pieca
of road which will revert to the watÂ«r com
pany for dam purposes is an exceedingly dan
gerous pfece of road and that a new road.
nlKher up which will be a safer ana mora
practicable one. can be . easily built for a
small amount of money. I am In favor ot
turning over that portion of the roa<f required
and the construction of a new pleco. as It
means a great deal to thÂ« people of this rap-
Idly growing section of Marin County. , ,;. ,
FAVORS CO.VCESSIO.V.
Supervisor Robert W. Johnson, when
seen to-day, said:
I am In favor of any reasonable concession
that would have a tendency tÂ» increase thÂ»
water supply, which Is becoming vÂ«ry lim
ited if the construction of the proposed d3m
will" relieve the necessities of a rapidly grow
ing population, which Is being kept bade
owing to the scarcity of water.
District Attorney Thomas P. Eovd. who Is
the legal adviser of the Board of Supervisor*,
made an examination of the- records of this
county and found that the right of way
through Phoenix Gulch contains the provision
referred to in Harrison's letter. He says that
there can be no legal obstacles In the way. .

County Water Company said this eve
ning: Â» ..'-â¢;

HOTEL WAITER'S COIDUCT
ASTOUDS HIS BRETHREN
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
With the commendable humaneness
that marks all its actions toward both
guests and employes, the Palace Hotel
management permits its waiters to
withdraw from a banquet after the last
course has been served and to remain
beyond earshot of the post-prandial
oratory until the last speaker has had
his say. let, strange to relate, one of
the waiters at a recent feast in the
big hostelry not only neglected to take
advantage of the opportunity afforded
him to avoid the spellbinding, but
blackened an eye belonging" to the su
perior in rank who reminded him of his
privilege and then insisted that he ex
ercise it. The assailant was arrested
and booked for battery, and on the
calendar of Police Judge Conlan's court
he was registered as A. Combys.
A. Bava, the complaining witness,
told the court that he was the chief
waiter at the banquet in question, also
that the conduct of Mr. Combys was
most extraordinary. While his brother
knights of the napkin eagerly fled from
the dining-hall just as soon as the first
toast was proposed, Mr. Combys re
mained and settled himself In attitude
to listen, and when informed In a
whisper by Chief Bava that he was at
liberty to depart he coldly declared
that, he preferred to stay where he
then was.
"But," pleaded the chief, "you are
expected to report for duty at the
usual time to-morrow morning, and
you cannot hearken to the talk that is
now flowing and preserve the intellec
tual clearness essential to a competent
discharge of your functions to-morrow.
These revelers are alcoholically fortl-*"
fled to withstand the oral affliction and
you are not. Pray, come."
"Go "way," was the response of A.
Combys, "and permit me to enjoy this
Demosthenic treat."
Instead of going away Chief Bava
asserted his authority by commanding
Mr. Combys to retire and then enforced
the command by means of physical
force at the risk of derailing the train
of thought of a stout gentleman who
had juat cleared his throat with claret,
said "Mr. Chairman," placed his finger
tips upon the damask and exhibited
other symptoms of Intent to respond
to "The Ladies â God bless 'em."
After being: ejected from the ban
quet hall Mr. Combys tras discharged
from his position by the heSad steward,
and the following morning he returned
to the hotel and. smote one of Chief
Bava's eyes with a clenched fist. The
damaged optio was displayed as evi
dence and Mr. Combys was pronounced
guilty of battery, as charged in the
formal complaint.
Judge Cabaniss heard the thrilling
details of a row In the laundry of St.
Luke's Hospital and will hear more of
them ere he hands down a decision in
the case of Arnold Amsteln, accused of
battery by Henry Bredeson. Mr. Am
etetn. who Is chief launderer, rebuked
Mr. Bredeson, employed as a porter,
for carelessly casting some linen upon
thÂ« Moor, and supplemented the rebuke
with unprintable words and expelled
Mr. Bredeson from the apartment. Mr.
Amsteln Informed the Judge that his
provocation was great, which he could
prove If he were given time to do 90,
and his Honor ordered a continuance
until witnesses can be subpenaed.
Alex ("Brick") MoPherson was com
mitted by Judge Fritz to answer In the
Superior Court the charge of extortion
sworn to by John Sheehan, who al
leged that he had ben mulcted of vari
ous email sums of money by the de
fendant on the plea that they were to
be utilized' in a smuggled opium deal.
Bail was fixed at $1000. McPherson ia
Â«_a old offender In this line, having
been up before on the same charge.
In his defense Mr. McPherson testified
thÂ»i the money was forced upon him
by Mr. Sheehan, who averred that he
had engaged In smuggling tobacco in
Ireland, where he was a schoolmaster.
It was while he was under the Influ
ence of two bottles. of beer. Mr. Mc-
Phereon swore, that he wrote the let
ters to Mr. Sheehan, In which United
States Judges Morrow and De Haven
and Collector of the Port Stratton were
alleged to be Yin on the deal" to which
Mr. Sheehan waa urged to subscribe.
Incidentally It developed that Mr. Mc-
Pherson Is 60 years of age. and that on
his last birthday he was given $2 60 by
Mr. Sheehan as a present.
"Professor" James, J. Kelly, putative
champion high diver, was pronounced
guilty of -having battered, the face of
Miss May Young at 4 o'clook last
Wednesday morning on Kearny street.
Miss Toung appeared before Judge Con
lan and denied that" she had willfully
slumbered abed instead of attending
court the previous day. as had been al
leged by Miss Eleanor Elliott.
"I stayed away." said Miss Toungr,
"because Eleanor told .me that If' I
came here this professor would be
soaked for six months."
Then Inquiry was made for Miss El
liott, but she could not be found in
the Hall of Justice and a bench war
rant was Issued for her arrest and
presentation in court this morning 1 .
"That's a nice story she told you
about me being so sleepy-headed that
nobody could - wake : me up," said - Miss
Young In great indignation &o the Judge.
"She knew this professor when he was
making high dives at Eureka and the
first time I ever, saw him was when she
brought him to the music hall In, which
I sing and Introduced; him as her
friend."
Th*Â« two tattles will meet face to face

DR. BRENNAN
LOSE POINT
Supreme Court Thinks That
Physician Should Not Be
Freed of 'Responsibility
JUSTICES UKGE HASTE
Decision Does Not Put End
to Dispute, but Is a Big
Victory for the Plaintiffs
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that Dr. Thomas Brennan could not ap
peal from the Superior Court decree com
pelling him to render an accounting of
the $37,524 13 secured by him from the
late Father P. J. Grey. The opinion does
not establish the ownership of the money,
but Is nevertheless an important victory
for the plaintiffs' heirs.
It was alleged at the time Father Grey
commenced suit for the recovery of the
fortune that Dr. Brennan had been given
the money to deposit in the aged priest's
name; that the physician had. made the
deposit in his own name and that he had
subsequently withdrawn and concealed
the sum. Dr. Brennan asserted that he
possessed a document . conveying the
amount in controversy to himself, and
objected to rendering an accounting until
It should have been. proved that he was
guilty of fraud.
Judge Sloss handed down an interlocu
tory decree directing that Dr. . Brennan
hold the $37,524 13 until a final settlement
should be made. The physician was given
authority to deduct from the sum men
tioned such amounts as might be neces
sary to defray expenses , for, the care of
Father Grey and in recompense for such
medical services as the doctor , had per
formed for the priest. This decision made
Dr. Brennan responsible for. the money in
dispute. He objected to . the decree and
appealed to the higher court. Father
Grey's attorneys made a motion to dis
miss the appeal and that 'motion is
granted.
The Justices do not want any time lost
in having the defendant made entirely re
sponsible for the safekeeping \u25a0 of the
money, and in furtherance that plan
they made* the remittitur returnable to
the lower court forthwith. .

SAYS STILWELL
WILL SUCCEED
Henry S. Manning, the well-known New
York capitalist and banker, who has been
a guest at the St. Francis Hotel for sev
eral days, says the Kansas City, Mexico
and Orient Railway; commonly known as
the Stilwell route, will be completed in
side of three years.
Manning is a director of the I road,
which is planned to extend from Wichita,
Kans.. â¢in a southwesterly direction,
through Kansas, Oklahoma Territory,
Texas and Mexico to Topolobampo.on the
Gulf of California. He has the utmost
confidence in the ability of A. E. Stilwell,
the promoter of the road, to accomplish
his plans, notwithstanding the peculiar
manner he has gone about them. ,
From the very time that Stilwell under
took the construction of the line, and
since portions of the road have been built,
many of the financiers of the country
have openly expressed their doubts as to
whether Us promoter would be able to
carry , his scheme out successfully, and
not a few of the railroad magnates have
thrown obstacles in his way at every op
portunity. Singularly, though, on several
occasions, when it has been reported that
Stilwell had exhausted his financial re
sources and was about to give up' his rail
road project, the Kansas City financier
has suddenly loomed up with funds and
resumed operations. Now he seems to be
possessed of ample assurance of success
in his big venture, and, according to
Banker Manning, he has passed the point
where further interference to his plans,
financially cr otherwise, is not expected.
Discussing the road last evening at the
St. Francis, Mr. Manning said:
The general public has not thoroughly un
derstood the conditions under, which Stilwell
has been building>the Kansas City, Mexico
and Orient Railway and they have frequently
misjudged him. " He is building- the entire
road through construction firms and not
through the financial aid of banking institu
tions. The road is' being built, in sections
and he is already operating a portion of his
line. He has laid his rails from Topolobampo
on the gulf eastward for about one hundred
and fifty miles.* and westward from Chihuahua'
he has about two hundred and Qtty miles of
road operating.
A great deal baa been - said of his inability
to cross the Sierra Madre Mountains, but this
work will be the least of his troubles, al-.
though admitted to be an expensive under
taking. Sometime ago Stllwell's engineers dis
covered a pass through these mountains that
even the natives of the country had not used,
and It is through this outlet that 200 miles
of the road will be built with ! a grade â¢of
-IS' per cent and with only two short tunnels.
It is estimated that It will take three years
to construct this portion of the road and two
years is the Â« limit that has been \u25a0 sat on the
completion of the 600 miles of road through
Texas and the territory which has been
portly graded. In my estimation, and It Is
shared by * many of those who have accom
panied Stilwell on some of his recent inspec
tion tours through the country which his road
'is to Invade, the Stilwell route will bÂ»- a.
' remunerative \u25a0 one and will materially change
the freight : conditions of to-day, particularly
In regard to foreign . transportation. - Shortly
after the , line leaves the western coast of
Mexico it stretches over - one. of the most
fertile sections of the southern republic, then
enters the rich mining aectlons. where abund
ance of business awaits It. The line has
also been surveyed through an enormous de
posit of anthracite coal that will prove a
valuable ' acquisition to \u25a0 the company. An
other point -In favor, of the road Is that It
will extend for miles and miles through ft
territory without paralleling . another line on
either side of It for a distance of 200 miles.
If the people of the United States have
shown any lack of confidence In the ability
of Stilwell to successfully carry- out his rail
road project * the people of Mexico have not
been so - disposed. No man In Mexico has
greater faith In : the Stilwell road than Presi
dent Diaz, and he; never misses an oppor
tunity to show : his confidence vwhen Stilwell
visits the Mexican capital.

OPPOSE MOVING
SCHOOL TO PARK
The "Western Addition Improvement
Club met last night to consider and pass
a resolution favoring the erection of the
new. Lowell High School building- on Oc
tavla street- The club opposed the idea
of having the school at the park, urging
for one thin? the "Injustice to inflict on
Western Addition scholars loss of time
and money to go to the park section."
The resolution, which was adopted, was
as follows:
Whereas. The ordinances of th# Board of
Supervisors providing for the issuance of bonds
to raise money for the purpose of purchasing
land and the construction of a new building
thereon for the Lowell High School also pro
vided that the land to be acquired should be
a certain lot fronting on Lafayette Park or a
lot of "similar size and of like value In the
Immediate neighborhood"; and
Whereas. The lot of full block f rontaÂ«e on
west - line of Octavta street, between Sutter
and Bush, and offered for sale for aaJd site,
meets the requirements of the said ordinance
providing for said bond issue and is in the
Immediate vicinity of the present site of said
school ' and i therefore ', most accessble to the
patrons thereof; and
Whereas. While the Idea of having public
buildings grouped around Golden Gate Park
Is laudable ithe growing panhandle. Sunset and
Richmond sections will soon require a. high
school In that section, and meanwhile as thÂ«
MJpsion has its high school It ia uajuÂ«t to
inflict on Western Addition scholars loss of
time and money to go to the park section;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That we. the members of the
Western Addition Improvement Club In meet
ing assembled, favor the location of the new
Lcwell High School building on said Octavla
street lot. known â¢as the Bell property, and
hereby petition .the honorable Board of Su
. pervlsors to purchase said lot for said purpose.
v The -officers of the club are: O. M.
Goldaracena. president: L. T. Samuels,
vice president; Naph B. Greensf elder.

FRIDAY JULY 2S. 1905
THE PROTECTION OF TAMALPAIS.
npHE recent arrest of two boys for kindling fires on Mount Tar
n alpais brings into view the inefficiency of the law in such
' * cases. This arrest was made under a law passed by the last
Legislating, which makes kindling such fires a misdemeanor, and
not a felony. As a misdemeanor the act is punishable by a light
fine and the" penalty carries with it no ignominy. \ All offenses which
carry with them the possibility of destruction of habitations and of
life are, according to the spirit of the law, felonies.
Mount Tamalpais is the most majestic and splendid natural
object on the land near to San Francisco. It is itself scenery of
"the highest grandeur, and from its summit a vast circumference of
scenery unsurpassed in the world may be viewed. Its slopes are yet
wooded, in parts by quite dense forest, and everywhere there is
copse that clothes it in beauty. This vast and beautiful upraise has
been the scene of many fires. Lives have been lost there and much
property destroyed in years past by conflagrations. Every one of
them was caused by criminal carelessness. Those who set the
fires were guilty of manslaughter, at least, if not murder in the sec
ond degree, when lives were lost.
It is pleaded for the persons recently arrested that they are
"boys." Well, it is time to teach boys that there is a limit to their
interference with the rights of others. Boys put an iron rail across
the track at Scapoose, Oregon, and nearly wreck a crowded pas
senger train. Boys steal the red flag and track bomb placed to
warn a crowded passenger train that workmen and material were
in a tunnel at Santa Cruz, and a horrible catastrophe is barely
averted. It is time that this class of boys were made to feel the
consequences of their crimes. Boys snatch newspapers from the
hands of passengers on street cars in this city, which in,, law is
highway robbery, the value of the property stolen having nothing
to do with the grade of the crime, and the police laugh and say, "It's
only the boys." Unless boys are taught that the law puts a limit
upon their actions, they will be lawless men. The boys who built
a fire on Mount Tamalpais and were arrested had read the cau
tionary signs all along the trail telling them that it was unlawful
to make a fire on the mountain. But they had no respect for the
law, and it is to be hoped that now they are in its clutches they
will be taught a lesson.
The protection of Mount Tamalpais is believed to be a step
toward its acquisition and maintenance as a State park. This is
very desirable. On the Atlantic coast there is no such park near
the sea or near any great city. Nor is there any other on the
American or Asiatic coast of the Pacific. That splendid summit
stands alone, the only height that commands a view of the ocean,
the land and landlocked waters, from such an elevation. In the
list of the grandeurs of nature it ranks with Niagara and the Yo
semite and Yellowstone valleys. It is the only thing of its kind.
No one can build a competitor. If it be stripped of its garment of
forest and copse, its beauty and grace will be gone, and it will be
no more than a tower built by man, with a view from its lofty
summit.
Assuming that the jurisdiction of the new Forestry Board ex
tends to Tamalpais, it is to be hoped that the Chief Forester will
take steps to have the mountain guarded and that he will not com
passionate incendiaries who fire it, because of their youth.
In the older States public jurisdiction is being extended to all
guch natural objects, and in Massachusetts to even the individual
trees on streets and by the roadside. Every town in that State
has a "Tree Warden." " The funds to carry on his protective .work
are raised in the town budget. He has charge of the shade trees,
and it is worth remembering that the law especially requires that
lie protect them "from boys and animals." He prunes, repairs and
preserves the trees that give shade and beauty to roads and streets,
end has charge of the planting of trees. 4 This law was procured
by the Massachusetts Forestry Association. That State has no
Very extensive forest tracts since the destruction of such; ma,de nec
essary to get rid of the gypsy moth. The association therefore is
devoting its energies to the town and village trees, with the inten
tion to plant and preserve them for an object lesson in preparation
for the reforestation of the former wooded tracts of the State. In
California we have the forests standing. Let us preserve them. Above
all, let us firmly protect those imperial works of nature, the State
Redwood Park and Mount Tamalpais.
OLD-AGE PENSIONS.
T NDUSTRIAL soldiers who have served the commonwealth faith
! fully have had their interests well considered in a study of old
* age pensions made by the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor. The
expression "industrial soldiers" is used in the language of the report
in order to make the argument that such men seem as deserving in
their old age of aid or a retreat, which shall not be called charity,
as the soldiers who have served in the army. The bureau puts
forward no solution of the question of what is the best method of
establishing a system of old-age pensions in Massachusetts, but it
is emphatically in favor of some system. The pamphlet is just one
part of the annual report, and "it states facts for the information of
sociologists, philanthropists, financiers, insurance experts and the
Legislature.
The aim of the study at this stage is to give, the elements of the
problem, trusting that a solution may come from them by the
various classes of minds which may deal with them. It is pointed
out that every person in the city of Boston who does not pay his
proportionate share of the city's expenses is in reality a pensioner,
and a recipient of benefits paid for by persons who are taxed on an
income or property basis. A sample case is taken of, say, a worker
with a wife and six children. The per capita share of his family
would be $645 44 for city expenses. He does not and cannot pay
it, for his wage is only about $600. So that he is a pensioner to the
extent of more than his earnings. This is recognized as his right,
and the facts of his receipt of benefits which he does not pay. for are
merely cited to show that society as at present constituted has
really adopted the principle of pensions, although it does not always
recognize and acknowledge it. It is deduced from this that when the
soldiers of industry become incapacitated by old age they should
receive benefits from the taxation of property.
A strong argument for old-age pensions would be made out if it
could be shown that support could by that means be more cheaply
furnished than by the present complicated and expensive systems
of promiscuous charity. Old age when indigent is, and must be,
supported by some method of giving, and the pension system should
be arranged so as to prevent the bitterness of charity coming to
those who^ad truly been "soldiers of industry" in their younger and
vigorous 33 r ears. To them it should be granted as a right, not as a
dole.
The figures of the report show that the sum expended in charity
in Massachusetts is more than would be required to pay pensions of
$260 per year to persons over 65 years of age who were not other
wise provided for. In giving examples of the success of old-age pen
sions in other countries, New Zealand is cited as a prime exemplary
the report saying: "It has captured the heart of New Zealand. It
appeals to the kindliness of the people and their sense of justice, and
â¢is undoubtedly the most popular of all the splendid measures carried
by the liberal movement." â¢
Who would ever have thought that Chauncey Mitchell Depew would
live to hear Thomas Collier Platt praised for lending dignity and moral
worth to a United States Senate from which Mr. Depew is urged to re
sign ?__Kew York Tribune.

(The possession of wealth is an" iso

think of nothing more lonesome than the
man with an immense fortune.â Cardinal
Gibbons.)
I CANNOT doubt the words are true;
And youâ
Why, surely you can clearly see
The fact so evident to me,
That wealth is isolated, lone:
In fact, the cases I have known #
Showed such privation, suffering, pain;
Such isolation, as was plain;
Such starving in the midst of fat.
And things like that,
That I, a sympathetic chap
Who hates to see a man's mishap,
Feltâ yes, I did;
' It can't be hidâ
I'd like to take the load of woe .
That seemed to hurt my brother so;
Just take his painful, golden pile
And bear it on my back awhile.
Don't smile.
I really did; that is my style.
For long on sympathy am I.
And, oh, my cash is sadly shy.
No; no bouquets at all for me!
You see,
I do not doubt you â¢ often feel
The tear of pity downward steal
At thought of some rich chap's distress,
Who bears his load of loneliness, ,
Of dire privation, suffering.
And. really, all that sort of thing.
Because of cash we might have hadâ
It's too dern bad!
And so I say, and so do you.
For you are sympathetic, too:
"Alas! Alas!
Now here's a pass!"
How gladly, gladly would we bear
His load of loneliness and care! '-
We'd like to takeâ we wouldn't mind-
Some isolation of that kind. )-;
You'll find
On introspection you're inclined
To be "quite long on sympathy.
But short on cash. I, too, you see.
A HOPELESS CASE.
(4TVTO hope is entertained for the pa
:j.\ tient in this cell." said the gen-,
t'emanly attendant, as the visitor
and he paused before the grated door.
"Hopelessly insane, is he?"
"Yes. Listen to his mutterlngs."
The visitor listened. Like the dreary
patter of the rain upon the roof was the
incessant babble that he heard:
"Suddenly, as the beautiful maiden
stood in the translucent moonlight that
shimmered adown the bosky glen, her
hand was uolif ted to her white and pal
pitating bosom as if in terror lest her
corset had unfastened, and she started
back.
"She had heard a footprint.
"It drew nearer.
"She started forward.
."Nearer yet!
"She started back.
â¢'Suddenly the burly ruffian whom her
sire had retained burst from the under
brush. 'Zblood!' he hoarsely 'shouted in
a whisper. 'Gadzooks! It isâ it isâ me
Mabyl!' . . . : '\u25a0:; Â£7;.
" 'Me Jawn!'
"The whispering spirit of the wind went
dancing down the glade, tenderly caress
ing the maiden's peroxide locks, but, en
folded In each other's arms, they heed
ed it not. From their long dream of bliss
they were awakened by the beautiful
girl's convulsive start.' '
â¢" 'What ls't, me own?' her companion
tenderly Inquired.
" Tell, oh, tell me, Jawn, does me â

" 'Speak, me love. Hold me no longer in
suspense.'
" 'Yes, I will speak. Does meâ me safe

"But hist! A long, wailing cry pierced
the silence, making a large hole in it
. "Again It pierced.
"They shuddered.
"Yet again. There were three holes
In the silence now.
"They shuddered some more. How
should they know it was but the family
skeleton out for an airing. Thenâ"
"You perceive what ails him?" the at
tendant inquired, as the two sadly turned
away from the cell.
"Sure!" was the answer. "He- tried to
read the 'six most-read books as fast as
they come not."
"You've guessed It- That's it."
IF YOU'RE GOING TO WIN OUT.

With a smile that is broad and big.

TEAGH YOURSELF CONCENTRATION
A Scattered Mind Means a Tired Body
and Nerves Out of Gear. V
ANGELA MORGAN
A YOUXG woman writes asking me to recommend some method of mind
culture that will teach her how to concentrate. "I cannot concentrate my
mind more than one minute at a time upon anything," is her unhappy
confession.
She has plenty of company. The only difference between this young woman
and millions of her sisters is that she realizes her deficiency and they do not.
X congratulate - her upon her discovery^
and can encourage her to fight hopefully'
for the desired change, for her battle is
already half won.
Most women ' reach middle age before
they even realize that they have failed
to develop the faculty of concentration.
They go on worrying and struggling with
their work and wonder why they so
easily get fretted and tirfd out.
All over the land to-bay there are
mothers and wives and sisters perform
ing ordinary tasks and duties in such a
scatter-brained way/ that the effort which
ought to-yield only pleasure and interest
has the effect of wearying mind and body.
Some day the revelation is sure. to come
to these unhappy members of the frailer
sex that what really ails them Is not
overwork, but scattered thought force. A
scattered mind means inevitably a tired
body and nerves out of gear.
I call attention to lack of concentra
tion as being peculiarly a feminine fail
ing, because it is an admitted fact that
the. masculine mind has had the advant
age of centuries of training in focusing
the mental faculties.
The very nature of woman's work has
prevented rather than assls*?d the de
velopment of concentration, \
The busy mother, with children to
dress and with clothes to mend and din- 1
ners to plan, was compelled to think of
"so many things at once" that she easily formed the habit of dividing her mind.
When she sat down to read a book a part of her thought was occupied in won
dering if the baby upstairs would waken soon from his nap; another part was
worrying vaguely with the problem of what to get for lunch, and a thin thread
of thought reached out anxiously to keep track of the time.
What was the result? When she closed her book she was not able to re
member a thing she had read and was conscious that the effort had wearied her
and made her nervous. Her mind, not her body, was tired. When the mind
is not concentrated upon the task before it, but pushes ahead to the duties yet
to come/ there is an actual waste of thought force which results in physical
weariness.
weariness. f
To the young woman who has written me, and to all others like her. I
would give this advice: Begin right now to practice concentration. You do not
need to attend any school or take up any special method of mind culture to do
Make your every-day duties and activities serve you as aids to the mentai
control you wish to gain. You could not. find better aids if you traveled across
seas and continents in search of them. These are close at hand, awaiting your
appropriation. . . '
Begin with your dressing in the morning. IJut your thought into It. If
you find your mind wandering, bring it back. Keep on trying. - s
While you are brushing your hair, refuse to let your thought waste itself
struggling* to' hook your collar before it is time. And while you are buttoning
your shoes, don't send your mind scurrying into the kitchen to light the gas
range and get the coffee ready. m , <
You cannot possibly get into the kitchen any sooner than your body will take
you. When you do arrive - there, put your mind Into the work of gee ting break
fast and. don't let it go whirling off into plans for the afternoon and evening or
into speculations about the new dress you are going to make.
You can teach yourself concentration if you will persist.
THE MAN WHO HAS TO EAT.
THE farmer can declare himself and vow whn accents deep
He'll make a bonfire of his crops before he'll sell too cheap; .
The miller and the teamster, if their pay they do not like,
Can at least attract attention to their troubles by a strike,
And when the battle's ended
And one side's entirely beat, ;\u25a0
The man who pays the damage
\u25a0 Is the man who has to eat.
When capital and laW get together in a clash,
And talk grows warm and threats arise which sound uncommon rash.
The man who has tne real right to shudder in dismay
Is compelled to watch the scrimmage and not have a word to say.
A merry dance they're leading,
â.nd the plan is very neat; .
For the man who pays the piper
Is the man who has to eat. âWashington Star.

? CHARLES SOX3TTAG,
Acting- Chairman Republican County
Committee.
July 27, 1805.
The membership of the San Francisco
Republican League is steadily and rap
idly increasing. Every day the letter
carriers deliver at league headquarters,
636 Market street^ many properly signed
aud identified applications for enrollment.
The active response to -the call for citi
zens to enlist in the cause of good gov
ernment is regarded as an assurance of
victory at the primary election on Au
gust S. The awakening of the people to
a sense of their civic obligations is grati
fying to the founders of the organiza
tion. Men who make a study of popular
currents predict that the vote at the
coming primary will break all records.
There is well founded belief that the
league will sweep the town, elect the
Mayor and the entire ticket. '
Districts which were considered doubt
ful at the beginning of the campaign are
now regarded as safe. For instance, in
the Thirty-ninth, where Maestretti is
fighting for "vindication" and employing
all the strength that the Ruef-Schmitz
administration can lend him, the pros
pects of the success of the Republican
League ticket are remarkably bright.
Maestretti cannot win, even with the as
sistance of job-holders and the inmates
of the Almshouse. Many of the stal
wart Republican citizens of the Thirty
ninth will be compelled to walk ten or
fifteen blocks out of their way to vote,
as the Election Commissioners have es
tablished voting places to suit the Maes
tretti gang, but the Republicans will get
there and vote despite the trick to shut
them out. Moreover, the gangsters in the
Thirty-ninth will be watched in every
6hady precinct. The Maestretti crowd has
no thought or Intention of supporting the
nominees of the Republican convention.
The delegation if chosen to represent the
district would take tne Ruef programme
and at the close of the convention walk
over to the Schmitz camp.
There was a rousing meeting of the
committee of ten and the auxiliary
committee of the Forty-third Assembly
District at headquarters of the San Fran
cisco Republican League last night. The
regular anti-Ruef Republican ticket in
the Forty-third is headed by Wiliam H.
Davis. Citizens of the district should
not be misled. The ticket headed by R.
H. "Warfleld is the Ruef ticket. It is
not a regular Republican ticket in any
sense. It is In the field to do Ruefs
work and to embarrass and harass the
Republican citizens who favor a clean
city and a clean administration. There
are several good men. It is true, on the
Warfleld ticket, but they are out of place
among the Ruefites. For example the
name of Horace Wilson appears on the
ticket. Information comes to The Call
that Wilson stated positively that his
name was used without his consent.
Tho Forty-third is an important dis
trict. The standard of citizenship is
high. It is a progressive Republican
district and every good citizen that sub
scribes allegiance to the Republican party
should vote at the primary and should
vote the ticket of the San Francisco
Republican League.
As the Forty-third District contains
eighty hotels, apartment houses and
boarding houses, the Joint committee of
the league last night resolved to make
a house to house canvass of the dis
trict. Residents who are out of the city
for vacation will be requested to return
for a day and vote at the primary elec
tion. *
Through the agency of the league every
citizen of San Francisco, whether he be
at Coronado Shasta or intermediate va
cation resorts, will be requestetd to come
home and vote. Signs are that there will
be a popular uprising of patriotic cltizen-
Bhlp at the primary to overthrow the
forces of graft and boodle.
From the Thlrty-Bixth, Thirty-eighth,
Fortieth and Forty -second districts come
reports of Republican activity. In the
Forty-fourth District the Ruefters are
working day and night. At the tail of the
Ruef ticket in the Forty-fourth is the
name of Thomas K. Kase. In the dlrec
tory of 1905 Kase figures as big as life as
a resident of Alameda. Recently he was
on one end, at least, of a franchise fight
In that city.
The league club in the Forty-second
District has a membership of 700. R. C.
Van Fleet of the committee and other
active workers reported at league head
quarters'.last night that the club would
hold an open meeting at Scottish Hall
next Wednesday evening.
The Ruef ticket ha* been sprung in the
Forty-first District. Information # came
to Republican headquarters last night

AGREES TO LEND
VOTING DEVICES
Standard Company to Deliver
Machines in Time for the
Election in November
CITY IS RESPONSIBLE
Reluctant Commission Feels
Aggrieved Because the
Supervisors Have Acted
The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors has received a telegram
from the United States Standard Vot
ing- Machine Company of Jamestown,
N. V., stating that it will lend the city
eighty machines in addition to the
eighty that were purchased last -week.
With the forty purchased last year, the
municipality will have 200 maohlnes
for, the municipal election in November,
enough to register all the.' votes la the
city. The company agrees' to deliver
the 160 machines by October 80.
Tho situation is somewhat compli
cated, however, for the Election Com
missioners refuse to take cognizance
of the acts of the Supervisorial com
mittee.
"The Election Board refused the of
fer of the company to lend eighty ma
chines," explained Commissioner De
voto last night, "unless it would ab
solve the Commissioners from liability
for damage or destruction. We wired
the Standard people to this effect, but
have received no reply from them.
"Yes, I hear that the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of* Supervisors has
agreed that the city will be responsible
forward eighty machines to be lent
company has telegraphed that it wih
forward eighty machines to be lent
to the municipality. But the Election
Board has the authority in the matter
and the Supervisors ought to have con
sulted us.' We can't take any notice of
what the Finance Committee is doing."
So runs the City Hall bickering:. The
Supervisors, It seems, have had to
force the Schmltz administration to
equip the cit/ with the contrivances
that reduce the opportunities of vote
stuffing.
The row first began when the Election
Commission awarded the contract to tha
United States Standard Voting Machine
Company for the purchase of the eighty
voting machines. At the same time the
Financo Committee accepted an offer
of a loan of 100 additional machines
from the same company. Tha commis
sion at once felt aggrieved because
the Supervisors had not consulted them
before taking action in the matter. It
developed that the Supervisors in ac
cepting the loan of these machines had
cut down the budget appropriations for
elections by $16,000, this being tho
amount tho machines would save in
expenses.
The commission then stated that it
would not be responsible for any dam
age that might occur to the borrowed
machines. At this period the Finance
Committee again stepped in and told
Frank Jordan, the agent of the voting
machine company, that the city would
be responsible for any damage that
might happen to them. The machines
were then ordered. Jordan says his
company will have to work day and
night to have the full complement here
and that they have already started in
to manufacture the reauired number.

"^The manufacturers of Castoria have been compelled to spend hundreds of

This has been necessitated by reason of pirates counterfeiting the Castoria trade*

but against the growing generation.. All persons should be careful to see that
( Castoria bears the signature of Chas. H. Eetcher, if they would guard the health

TENNY MEETS
NEIL TO-NIGHT
Bantams Are Ready to Mix
It in a Twenty-Five Round
Bout Before' Colma Club
EX-CHAMPION FAVORITE
Hard-Hitting Little Amateur
' Figures on Bringing Over
Haymaker on His Opponent
â¢
Harry Tenny. the hard hitting little
amateur bantam weight champion of the
Pacific Coiitt, will make his bow as a pro
feÃsional scrapper this evening at Colma
when ht faces Frankie Nell, the former
holder of the worlds title. The lads are
matched to box twenty-tivÂ© rounds under
the auspicss of the Golden State Athletic
Association and the mill ehouid prove a
fast one vrhilt It last's.
Nell, as would be expected, rules a 2
to 1 favorite over the amateur, but as
the latter 5s there with an awful wal
lop and can etand a whole lot of pun
ishment, hir followers look for him to
bring one ovtr and win the bout on a
knockout before it goes the limit. Tenny
is very confident and figures on beating
down Neil at his own game, which is a
strenuous one.
Neil's experience will teH-ln the long
run. and for this reason he figures on
beating Tenny. Frankie is one of the
hardest hitlers at his weight who ever
stopped into a ring. He can punch v.Tih
that left hand of his with as much force
as an ordinary lightweight, and unless
Tenny wins quickly it looks as though
the former champion is due to bring home
victory.
. Jim Neil, Frankie's father, arrived from
the north yesterday and at once made
haste to his boy's training quarters. Jim
r.as delighted with Frankie's condition
and said he never saw the lad looking
po well before. Jim will have a good bet
down o;i his offspring and thinks the lat
ter will bring over a haymaker in jig
time.
Tenny has been training for the bout
for the last month and if condition counts
for anything he sure ehouid be there.
'Jenny is being handled by Mike Canavan,
the well-known St. Louis sporting man,
who has carefully watched the youth's
training since he has settled down to hard
work.
Neil will have Tim McGrath and Spider
Kelly in his corner and therefore will not
be at a loss for good advisers. Johnny
and Martin Frayne, who have been work
ing with Frankie during his training, will
also help second him. Billy Roche will
roferee the bout. Joe Reilly and "North
side" Jack O'Brien will furnish a ten
round preliminary. .
The management guarantees first-class
car service and assures the patrons of the
pame they will arrive in this city by
midnight. A special train as well as a
long line of electric cars will be in waiting
to tronsport the crowd back after the
bout.
HKHBEUTS PITS CL.OTCY AWAY.

Out of Clinch.
' VALLEJO, July 27. â After outpoint
ing George Herberts all the way. Jack
Clancy dropped before a stiff right to
the Jaw in the tenth round of his fight
at the pavilion this evening. Her
berts was looking for the chance and
when the opening came, as they were
coming out of a clinch, he shot over a
wicked short arm right jolt and Clancy
took the count.
The mill was full of nice work from
the first round on. Clancy outboxed
Herberts and showed him up In the fine
points of the game. He led with his
left and was dancing around and wing
ing "em In all the time. Things were
breaking fine for him and lt looked in
Jill the finish.
"When the tenth round opened, Her
berts ruehed Clancy around the ring
and they went into a clinch. Just as
they were breaking, Herberts brought
his right over and lt landed flush on
Clancy's jaw. The former English
champion Eank to the floor and re
mained there while Referee Jack Welch
counted"liim out. He sprang to his
feet a few seconds later and wanted to
continue, but it was too late.
. Willie Johnson and Ed Conway, both
of San Francisco, fought six rounds to
a draw in the preliminary. The boys
put up a clever go. The fight was
witnessed by a full house and was held
under the auspices of the Palm Athletic
Club.

1 The champion Tigers are not yet ac
quainted with the curves which Mr.
Hitt is wont to toss up, consequently 1
second money was 'theirs yesterday 1
again and by a shutout once more at j
1 that; Besides Ijeing a wizard with his
i benders, Hitt was backed up in such
'a way that it was impossible for a
I Tiger to get on base unless he hit one
to the fence, and this feat did not
: happen very often.
The game was the best seen here for
; many a moon. The series will decide
which team shall float the banner for
the first half of the season, and .as
Uncle thinks he will beat the Tigers
every day this week, his team is work
ing. for a fare-ye-well, for' four more
victories will mean that the Seals will
be the first half champions.
The Tigersv were outgamed as well
as outplayed and outgeneraled all
along the line yesterday. They were
none too steady with men on the bases,
while the Seals got everything. Time
and time again Hitt was yanked out
of a hole when it looked bad for him.
The Tigers managed to land hard all
during the game, but their drives were
invariably gobbled up.
The first run for the Seals carno
about on a combination of misplays.
Spencer opened up the third with a
drive which McLaughlin dropped. Wal
dron tore off another hit, but Mohler
forced Spencer at third. Hildebrand,
however, was. there with a drive to
center field and it brought Waldron
right home.
The Seals did not do anything till
the fifth, when they started in once
more and eased another through. Moh
ler slammed one safely and Hildebrand
laid down a bunt. The hit and run
signal was passed and the Kid skim
med all the way around as Charley
Irwin tapped a sizzler out of Mike
Lynch's reach.
The Seals came very near, tearing
through with another in the seventh.
Spencer singled through the Infield and
Waldron beat a bunt, his third hit for
the day, sending Spencer around to
third. Mohler produced a long fly to
Lynch and Mike winged the ball per
fectly to the rubber, catching Spencer
three feet.
The nearest the Tigers came to grab
bing a run was in their half of the
seventh, when Lynch clouted one past
short and Casey doubled to the far
corner of right field. Spencer had the
ball in a twinkling, and, with a per
fect peg to the plate, he nailed Lynch
a foot. The Tigers had the bases full
in the sixth with two out, but the
best JCordyke could do was to smash
one at Mohler that was an easy out.
Emerson will do the pitching for the
Tigers this afternoon, while Uncle will
stick ."W'halen in again. Should the
Seals get away with the game, Hitt
is carded to work again on Saturday
and Whalen will probably take another
turn In one of Sunday's games if the
raoe is still close. A big bunch of
San Jose fans will turn out to root for
Emerson this afternoon. The score:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
. ST. LOUIS, July 27.â The police still
continue their invasion of Delmar race
track,': and to-day they, again took
charge of the betting ring. The.con
tlnued visits of the officers are having
a serious effect on the crowd, and it
is not believed the racing game can
be Â£ continued much longer. Purses
have been cut slightly once more, but
horsemen say they will stand for
that until the. St. Louis authorities
cease interference without proper jur T
isdiction. ., :^'-j:rA
Governor Folk . has ordered Chief
Kiely ; to : take measures preventing the
Western Union from supplying racing
information to poolrooms, even to' the
extent of cutting thewires. The tele
graph office to-day was, still operating
notwithstanding an operator for the
police department took a position at
the booth and remained there through
out the afternoon, trying to see if the
qbjeotionable .matter was being sent
out. The crowd did not number over
350 and the betting was very light.

BROUGHT BACK
Revenue Cutter McCullocli
Returns From Eureka
With Shipwrecked Tars
IS DAMAGED IN GALE
Government VesseLon Way
to Tricolor's Assistance Is
Badly Battered by Seas
Th* captain and crew of the wrecked
Norwegian collier Tricolor arrived here
yesterday from Eureka on the revenue
cutter Hugh McCulloch. The McCulloch
made cne of the fastest round trips be
tween here and Eureka on record. The
shipwrecked sailers were probably more
comfortable on the Government vessel
than they could have been in the limited
Quarters of a small coaster, but the cost
to the Government of the McCulloch's
cruise will be considerable. Captain Cant
well drove his ship at a thirteen-knot
gait through a strong- northwester, and
as a result Uncle Sam will have to foot
a heavy bill for repairs to the pretty
cutter.
The McCulloch left here at 7 o'clock
Tuesday evening, nearly two hours
after the Merchants' Exchange had re
ceived word of the safe arrival of the
Tricolor's crew at Eureka. Of this, how
â¢ ver. Captain Cantwell was not aware.
Outside, the cutter ran into a north
wester. The wind was blowing. Captain
Cantwell says, at least fifty miles an
hour, and the' sea was extremely high.
Into this the McCulloch was driven full
speed, and in spite of wind and sea main
tained a speed of about thirteen knots an
hour. Green seas dropped repeatedly on
the cutter's bow. with the result Â«...cÂ» the
stanchions supporting the forward deck
buckled and the deck settled two and a
half Isches. Seas swept the cutter's main
deck, striking with terrific force against
the cabin bulkhead and splitting the
beam on which the structure rests. The
spray swept the bridge like the fire from
a machine gun and with such force that
:i tore adrift the weather cloths.
The McCulloch reached the lightship
off Blunts Reef at 10 a, m., Wednesday,
arid arrived at Eureka at 3 o'clock p. m.
She took on board the crew and the boats
paved from the Tricolor, and at 7 p. m.
started back for this port, which she
reached shortly after noon yesterday.
Captain H. Wold, his officers and crew,
twenty-six souls in all. will go from here
to Norway as soon as the Norwegian
Consul can arrange for their transporta
tion.
Captain Wold, at Eureka, placed the
blarno for the loss of the Tricolor upon
the lightship fcr whese whistle he was
listening when the collier crashed on the
rocks nearly four miles inshore from the
lightship. The people on the lightship
told him their whistle was not started
ur.til 4:SO a- m., more than an hour after
the Tricolor went ashore. To mis state
ment he now adds that the weather up
to 4:30 o'clock was comparatively cfear.
The people on the lightship say they
could see nearly four miles, and Captain
Wold admits that when the Tricolor went
ashore the lockout on the collier could
tee at least three miles.
Captain Wold accepts the blame for the
disaster, which could hardly have oc
curred had he taken ordinary precautions.
He passed Cane Blanco at 9 a. m., July
Si. la the aftemcxni -a fog set-in.- After
running for eleven and a half hours he
stepped the Tricolor and took Just one
cast cf the lead. He round no bottom
at sixty-flve fathoms, concluded he had
passed Blunts Reef and changed his
â¢ship's course to a southeasterly direction.
Akhoujrh he had changed the steamer's
course, Captain Wold was not certain
e.icugh of his position to turn in and get
the sleep he needed quite badly. It never
occurred to him, however, to make some
further use of the sounding machine with
which the Tricolor was equipped. As a
matter of fact, a sounding taken at any
time during the two hours before the
\u25a0vessel struck would have shown Captain
Wold that he w^s oft his course and for
the last half hour the Tricolor waÃ steam
ing along in less than fifteen fathoms of
water.
An investigation will be held by the
Norwegian Government and Captain
Wold expects that, in consideration of
this being his first accident, his license
will be suspended for not more than one
year. The local inspectors have no Juris
diction in the matter, which is probably
fortunate fcr Captain Wold.
Ths Tricolor, which cost 1200.000 not
very long ago, will be a total loss, and it
is doubtful if even part of her cargo can
be recovered, as it would be unsafe foÂ£
a vessel of any size to go within a mile
of where ehe is stranded.
Doth Make Lonsr Trips.
The barks R. P. JRlthet and Annie Johnson
arrived yesterday Irom Honolulu, both having
made very long passages. The Rithet was
thirty days and the Jchnaon thirty-five days
:;. .-a'the Uiand port. Captain McPhail of the
R:thet was afraid he would run thort of pro
vistorue and when he sighted the schooner Mary
K. Fester a few days ago ne aslced that vessel
.for food. Tfae Foeter was short herself, how
ever, and was obliged to refuse.- F<3Hanately
the wind proved kinder than the Foster, and
the Rithet .reached port without errw or pas
ee&gers experiencing the discomfort of life on
Fhort rations. The Johnson and RSthet were
fuÃilrs-ted at the quarantine station before
they were created free pratique.

RENT FDR FERRY
STANDS REDUCED
Foster & Orear Plead News
Business Has Fallen Off
and Board Is Liberal
CUT OF $1000 A MONTH
Unable to Pay $1765, the
Figure to Which the Bid
Was Run Some Time Ago
The State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners met yesterday afternoon, Presi
dent C. H. Spear presiding:. A com
munication from Foster & Orear, who
hold the privilege of maintaining news
stands in the ferry building, was con
sidered. The holders of the concession
asserted that the sum of $1765 per month
paid to the State was much more than
the privilege was worth. Foster &
Orear reviewed at some length the inci
dents leading up to the fixing of that
rental, setting forth that they were com
pelled to pay an exorbitant price or sur
render the business which they had been
building up for fifteen years.
They further asserted that the firm
was losing money and could no longer
pay the amount charged. Among the
causes given for a falling off in the busi
ness was the installation of twenty min
ute service on the Southern Pacific
route, which diminished the waiting time
of passengers. It was also stated that
the Key route took many passengers.
The firm asked the commissioners to
have an expert examine the books of the
concern to verify the facts set forth in
the application for a reduction of ren
tal. - .
Foster & Orear offer to pay JSOO a
month for the privilege, provided the
right of maintaining the newsstand in
the Key route section of the depot i 3
embraced In the concession.
Commissioner Mackenzie introduced a
resolution fixing the rental at JSOO a
month from August I, and moved its
adoption. Commissioner Crocker second
ed the motion. The resolution prevailed.
President Spear did not vote but de
clared the motion carried on the affirm
ative votes of the other commissioners.
When the competition for the privilege
began in 1904 'Foster & Orear were pay
ing $430 a month. Competitive bidding
ran up the figure to $1765. The commis
sioners recently declined $100 a month
for the newsstand concession In the Key
route section of the depot. Figuring that
this is embraced in the new concession,
the reduction which Foster &. Orear
obtain exceeds $1000 per month.
Commissioners Crocker and Mackenzie
held that the fact had been established
that the firm could not pay the present
rental without losing money every
month.
Hereafter the privilege of maintaining
oil pipe lines on the water front must
be paid for by the oil companies. The
rate for each pipe line was fixed at $25
a month.

SAYS HIS PALS
DEFRAUDED HIM
Eugene Sullivan Protests
He Did Not Get Divvy
in Naturalization Scandal
LED TOJAIL, HOWEVER
Secret Agent Taylor Works
Actively and Insists on
; High: Bail for Prisoners
; Another capture was added yesterday
by.? United States Secret Service Agent
Richard H. Taylor to his collection in
the City Prison awaiting trial for per
jury in the -fraudulent naturalization
cases. The new..; prisoner Is Eugene
Sullivan, formerly a \u25a0 collector for the
State ) Board of Harbor Commissioners.
The arrest was" made personally by
Agrentt Taylor. Sullivan was drunk
when : the ag-ent found him, and all the
way to the office of the United States
Marshal Sullivan protested that the
money which was the price of the
perjury had been collected by Frank
Johnson, now under arrest in the same
matter, and that Johnson had refused
to pay him his: rigrhtful' share. Sulli
van's bail was fixed at $5000, in default
of which he was taken to the City
Prison; â¢\u25a0;-. â¢\u25a0â¢..
The -complaint against Sullivan
recites that on Aug-ust 22, 1904, he
swore in Judg-e Kerrig-an's court that
he had known Christen Klltgraard. an
applicant for citizenship, to have re
sided within the United States for five
years, when, in fact, Sullivan knew
that Klitgaard had not been in this
country for more than five months.
Sullivan is married and resided with
his wife at 518 Van Ness avenue.
The;; examination of Frank Johnson
and Gustave Holmgren was held yes
terday before - United States Commis
sioner. Heacock.- They were accused
of perjury in the matter of the applica
tion of Frank Werta for citizenship
in Judge Kerrigan's department of the
Superior Court. They were held for
trial and their bonds Were fixed* at
$5000, in default of which they were
taken to the City Prison. Bert Schles-
Ing-er, of. counsel for the defendants,
asked that bail should be reduced to
a sum / which the prisoners would be
able to secureÂ« but the motion was "de
nied, , Ag-ent Taylor announcing- openly
that .if the prisoners should be re-"
lease* upon any bail whatever he
would at once rearrest them.

CANNOT CONDEMN
IMPURE FOODS
City Attorney Says Health
Board Has No Power to
Put Goods Under the Ban
ARREST ONLY COTJESE
Drugs Not Within Provisions
of Section 347 A Need Not
Be Labeled as Poisonous
City Attorney Long yesterday rendered
an opinion in response to queries pro
pounded by the Health Board, in which
he holds that the board has no authority
or power to condemn food or drugs. The
opinion is important, as heretofore the
Health Board has taken upon itself to
condemn wines, catsups, drugs and other
products and has compelled the sellers
to remove them , from their shelves and
afterward destroy them. The opinion says
that the statutes provide for prosecution
of the' offender, but the officials have no
authority over his goods. The opinion
is as follows: '-*,?..
I_ all the statute* prohlbltlss thÂ« adultera
tion of foods, drugs or wines will be found
penal provisions under which the person or
persons guilty of a breach thereof may be>
prosecuted, but nothing which may ba con
strued as granting to the State Board of
Health or to boards of health of cities the
power to condemn adulterated toods or drugs.
The addition to food of anything of a poison
ous character would operate to take the mixture
or compound without the exception, on the
theory that It thereby becomes injurious to
health, and subject it again to the prohibition*
against adulterated foods. Therefore, In thÂ»
case of foods, the use of which would prove
poisonous, the proper course to pursue would
not be to compel the affixing of a label with
the word "poison" thereon, but a prosecution,
of the seller under the penal provisions of
the statutes against adulteration.
The seller or non-poisonous drugs, that Is,
those drugs which are not within the pro
visions of section 347 A of the Penal Code,
cannot be compelled to mark them as poison
ous even though the Board of Health may so
deem them. The board Is not granted dis
cretion in that regard, the Legislature having
determined definitely which drugs shall and
which shall not be deemed of a poisonous
character and having provided a punishment
for the person guilty of \u25a0 a breach of the pro
visions of the statute. i
Any attempted official tondemnatlon Of
adulterated products being a .void act upon
your part, any ban under which these said
products may have been placed not only may
but should be removed by you. Irrespective of
any action upon the part of the vender.
You are therefore advised, first, that every
retailer must distinctly label with the word
"poison" each and every bottle, package, ves
sel or box containing any one or more of the
drugs enumerated in section S47A. or any
compound, preparation, extract, salt, or tinct
ure of said drug or drugs, or lay himself
open to criminal prosecution; second, that
placing a label upon adulterated products
showing the names and per cent of the con
stituent parts thereof does not remove drugs
from the prohibition of the statute against
adulteration but does so remove food, pro
vided the said food be not injurious to health;
third,' that the Board of Health can exercise
no discretionary power in the premises, but
is bound by the clear and distinct provisions
of the codes and statutes of this State bear
ing urion the retail sale of poisons and the
adulteration of foods and drugs.
MAN WHO TRIED TO CAUSE
ARREST OF OTHERS IS JAILED
Informer Is) Said to Be Member of
Counterfeiting: Gang: He Promised
to Betray.
SEATTLE. July 27.â L. B. Talley. a
paint merchant of Centralia, has been
arrested by Captain Bell of the Secret
Service upon the charge of aiding- and
abetting: counterfeiting. It is claimed
that Talley agreed to locate for the offi
cer, for a reward, "a band of counter
feiters who were making- spurious five
dollar gold coins. He was put off and
an Investigation showed the authorities
that he himself was a party to the
counterfeitin_". His arrest followed.
Talley declares his arrest is spite work
because after he received pay from Bell
he was unable to locate the counterfeit
ers. Bell left for Centralia to-day with
three warrants, said to be for a banker,
a saloon man and -a retired merchant,
all of that place.
EASTERN CAPITALISTS TO WORK

In the Once Noted Tuscarora
District.
ELKO. Nev., July 27.^ â For the last

COMPANY WITHDRAWS ITS
PETITION FOR FRANCHISE
OAKLAND, July 27.â The Street Rail
way Committee of the Board of Super
visors to-night took up the application
of the Oakland traction Company for a
franchise along East Fourteenth street.
The meeting was attended by a large
representation of residents of East
Oakland, Alameda, Fruitvale and other
"portions of the territory through which
the proposed line is projected. ,The ma
jority favored ; the company's applica
tion, but a r contingent, led by James A.
Johnson, opposed the granting of the
petition and the matter was discussed
until nearly midnight. , The Street
Railway Committee finally went into se
cret session, : and, reconvening, agreed
to -recommend the franchise provided
the company would pay $5000 for it,
straighten out the street at its own ex
pense and ' keep the entire width of the
thoroughfare watered. Upon this-an
nouncement the traction company with
drew its petition for a franchise.

CONDITION OF TRADE.
r Crop*, Dry Gooda, Steel and Stocks.
The Ntw Vcrk circular of Henry Clews eaye:
"The factor of prime importance at the
preser.t time is the com crop; the weather aow
current is certainly Ideal and promises. In view
of the increase of mere than 2.000.000 acres in
the area, to furnish a harvest that has not
heretofore been exceeded in this country. But
It will be fully tha mia^le of August beforo
the crop may be considered out of danger.
Meanwhile the prospects certainly favor Ir
regularity in the etock market, for It Is quite
sr.rrobcb'.a that the crop will proceed to ma
turity without a number of setbacks of more
or lees importance. Spring wheat will also
constitute an Influence for stock market fluc
tuations during tfci* period, and the outlook
tnsy therefore be considered favorable for a
market fluctuating IC2 points in either direc
tion. From the agricultural standpoint, the
outlook for a period of Inflationâ of exuberant
prosperity â is certainly favorable.
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL.
"Investlts-tlona by usually conservative au
thorities indicate a favorble outlook in the
commercial and industrial fields. Probably the
best test of the commercial situation is the
great dry eood* distributing machinery of the
country; and a thorough inquiry among these
distributors indicates particularly optimistic
conditions. The dry goods jobbers of the coun
try almost without exception report that for
the first half of this year their business has
chown distinct Improvement, both In volume
ar.d In profits, over the corresponding months
of 1904; they also report their stock In good
condition a-J preparations for a decidedly im
proved fall trade; asd perhaps the most sig
r.'.acaat feature of al! is that the greatest op
timism Is expressed in the great corn growing
sections of the country. From the industrial
standpoint the treat Iron end steel industry
n.^y certainly bu coneldered the most accurate
barometer of approaching conditions; and recent
reports quite generally Indicate that the glass in
this direction is rising. The demand for 6teel
rails has recently shown distinct Improvement,
. â¢R-lth no necessity on the part of manufactur
f,-s of encouraging buyere by making conces
sions in prices; and the demand for structural
shapes fcr buildings and for bridges has of
late developed particular activity, not alone
lor immediate requirements, but foy deliveries
we!l into the future. The general export busi
ness i 6 also working into good shape, and tho
fiscal year that closed with the month of
June was thfe largest, from an export stand
point, that we have yet experienced."
Dried FrultÂ« In Â»wr York.
Late mail advices from New York say:
"The feature of the market was the an
nouncement of opening prices on California
Figs. " The quotations are: Choice. 50c; extra
choice. 55c. and fancy. 60c. In one-pound pack
ages. The crop conditions are reported as
reasonably g&od and a fair yield is consid
ered probable. No large transactions wÂ«re rcr
ported at the opening figures, though it was
understood that the quotations were not re
garded unfavorably by the trade. The si tui
tion in Smyrna, which has not clearly devel
oped as yet. will be a strong influence In the
eale of California fruit. Spot business in all
varieties v necessarily light at this reason,
tut mcst,Â«'rades are held steady. No one cares
to take fe"Â»ods from storage unless advancing
prices wairaat It- Peachts are firmer on the
eg.; - 1 Â«.nd, . Â»b'lc no Quotable advance Is n*
ported. ttÂ« fact that some packers "nave wlth
drav.n' frurn the market at C^4c for choice
yellows is equivalent to an advance. No 1m -
portant sales, are reported here and conditions
are generally regarded as favorable. Prune*
continue f.rm with conditions tending toward
an advance In prices. The extreme hot wf ath
er In California has caused a eerious drop In
condition, shriveling a jrood many of these left
en the trees. The effect is an indicated heavy
reduction in output. Up to 3VÂ«c is asked for
the four sizes in bags, October shipment, and
offers of lees are promptly refused. The situ
ation in Oregon remains substantially as pre
viously reported. Apricots are quiet, with
little or no interest developing either here or
on tie coast. Raisins are too quiet to attract
any attention Fancy Eastern seeded are
quoted up to 6Vic and choice are held at sÂ»ic.
but In the absence of important sales these
prices are little more than nominal. What
Influence the latest attempted combination of
Interests on the coast will exert upon the mar
ket It is Impossible to say."

VPIV TORK. July 27. â Something of an In
novation uppeared at times In the etock market
to-fiay nut notwlthtsanding this appearance
the total sales for the day reveals small In
crease in the actual volume of thÂ« market.
The rarlfl movement of special stocks of sec
ondary importance was what gave color to the
*pecu!at'.cn and it will be seen that many of
r/"-e most r-romlnent storks on the exchange
r.ere cealt in to small extent ana that the ma
jority of the list as a whole was wholly over
come. Without any widespread feeling In the
market In cne quarter, sympathetic response In
enother is likely to be found, and spotty
movements pueh as those of to-day are natur
a!!y !nterprÂ» > ted as coming: from professional
operation* cf a more or leÂ« artificial character.
The uplift of prices was accomplished, how
rver. without meeting- sny important pressure
to realise, with the notable exception of the
E'le ptocfc*. which were pubjected to tbe profit
taking which lsas H-ov^d lr.eX'lUWe In all re
rent cases on the publication of good news.
BuÂ» wMle the Erles themselves were . back
ward the placing cf the second preferred
ytock on tbe dividend list by yesterday's
declarations of a full, year's dividends was
undoubtedly- the prime factor In encouraging
th* professional attempt to Initiate a move-,
rncnt for a rise. When the action of the Erie
directors I* consldtr*fl as k supplement to tfc*
Increased dividends in Reading. Burlington and
Ov!oO v !o and Amalgamated Copper and the reten
tion for Illtnols Centra! of what has been
called an extra disbursement and designed to
r*:ebrate a notable occasion for the company
thÂ«>re is presented quite n comprehensive array
cf evidence of the confidence rx'stinK among
railroad manasers In the stability of the con
ditions which have lifted the profits cf oper
ation co as to enable Increased disbursements
to stockholders. While roae of the Western
â¢inroads eharrd In the 4ay'a strength stocks
cf the Eastern arid Southern trunk lines were
the conspicuous features of the strength, the
so-called <51ffer*>rtial lines enjoying the widest
movements The Intimations that the money,
control of thp*e railroads was asserting itself
to rcrce a settlement of tbe war of rates which
ha* been In force for some time was believed
aÂ«n afford a baels for to-day's movement. No
Attention was paid to reports of additional
ousrantine - measure* eirainst ,the spread of
yf!!ow fever In the South and further opinions
of damage to spring: wbeat were without effect
unless In restricting the activity of the mar
ket Foreign exchange reacted sharply In eplte
of tne hardening of London dU count s and some
â¢
attention was paid to reports of peace pros
pects, and especially to the rise of Russian
bonds In Paris. The taking of the day's
profits Involved some inroads upon prices in
the last hour of trading, but the closing was
firm.
Bonds were firm. Total 6ales, par value.

quite active, with yesterday's shorts and the
outsiders -buying freely. The leading Wall

had sold cotton yesterday, but that he had not

CHICAGO BOARD' OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. July 27.â The - wheat market
opened firm, with September %Â©%c to %@%c
up at 86% c to S7c. Wet weather In the Nortn-'
west .was the principal reason., for the; Initial
firmness. Another factor was aÂ» fair advance
at Liverpool. The rain in the spring wheat
teritorry was generally supposed to favor the
spread of the much feared black j rust. The.
strength at Liverpool was said to be ' due to
reports of damage to the Russian crop. As a
result of Weather Bureau predictions of rain
to-morrow throughout Minnesota and the Da
kotas an active demand developed from com
mission houses and caused ' prices to advance
above the opening level, September touching
87 % c. Toward the end or tne firet hour, how
ever, the market became quite weak. A sharp
break in corn was partly responsible for quite
liberal profit-taking in wheat and started wheat
prices downward. In addition crop news from
wheat in the Northwest, while conflicting, fur
nished much encouragement to bears, -many
advices stating that black rust had done little
damage thus far. On the reaction September
sold off to So%e. The weakness was short
lived. Shorts soon began to Duy freely agalu.
In response to the improved demand prices
rallied quickly. \u25a0 One reason for the renewed
activity among shorts was a comparative de
crease in primary receipt?. An advance of %c
to lc In the price of cash wheat at Southwest'
crn markets helped to strengthen the option
market here. September closed firm at 86%@
67c, a gain of %@lc.
Heavy liquidation by prominent longs caused
weakness in corn. Ttw close was fairly
bteady. September being %Â®%c lower at 53c.
Weakness 6f corn resulted in renewed liqui
dation of oats and the market was Inclined to
weakness. September closed Vie flown at 29% c.
Provisions were firm. At the close Septem
ber pork was up 10c at $18 15. lard was Up
7n@loc at $7 30. and riba were s@i %c higher

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
A good portion of the day's arrivals of
fresh fruits, particularly those from the river
districts, came to hand late, and as a result
there was a scarcity of choice stock during
the early trade. The market ruled firm â¢ for
nearly everything in the deciduous line at the
opening, but. weakened slightly upon the ar^
rival of the belated supplies. Prices of the
leading descriptions ruled steady, however, as
the canners were still purchasing freely and
the demand for regular consumptive account
was up' to the average. \u25a0 Apricots in crates
were firmer and Peaches had an Upward ten
dency offerings In open boxes I from Sonoma
finding ready sale at 60073 c per bbx. | Plums.
Prunes Nectarines and wrapped Pears of gooct
quality were steady and Figs were still scarce
and high. Grapes were In Increased supply
and larger variety, but ' were rather slow of
sale \u25a0 " A straight \u25a0 carload of Seedless . falls
dve 'to-day from Sultana. Nutmeg Melons and
Cantaloupes Were firm during the early trade
because of the belated river boat, but there :
*as plenty ' of stock available at ' reasonable
prices later on. ' Berries were quoted steady
to firm â¢as to variety and quality. , Lemons j
were firmly held at sharply advanced rate?, ;
the high prices paid at shipping poliita neces-*
sttatlng the asking of " correspondingly high
prices here, Otherwise there was nothing new
to report in Citrus goods

'Healtji "Board "'\u25a0Declares Posi
tion of- Warden Vacant
Despite Ruef and* Mayor
DR. WARD IS OBDURATE
Pull of Administration Fa
vorite JJnavail ing Against
Physician Who Is a Power
The. Health /Board yesterday adopted a
resolution '^declaring vacant the, position
of i warden at" the City "and County Hos
pital held ". by. Martin W. Fleming, j This
action, followed close upon, the suspension
of Fleming 'by Dr. James ,W. .'Ward,
president of the Health Board, who visit
ed', the hospital last .Thursday, and waited
several J hours for. Fleming to put _in an
appearance. notification to Flem
ing read* simply: "You are suspended
untile further notice." .. -.
Fleming] was , of." the opinion that ' Ward
. would Y^relent; and that; he -would be- re
instated'in' a" day or two." ; Fleming visit
ed ; the Mayor,, with .. whom he * made his
peace; and the Mayor stated afterward
that : Fleming, would v be reinstated. Dr.
Ward, however, -was obdurate and being
a' stickler' Tfor- discipline prevailed " upon
hJs fellow-members of : the* board to agree
to .'the ousting; of. Fleming. â¢ ; ,
-Abe ' Ruef '.was anxious .to see Fleming
restored to hla place, but the. combined
efforts of the wily , politician and the
Mayor 'himself "were unavailing and Dr.
Ward ; has ; carried his point in spite of
them. No t reason is assigned . for 3 the re
moval of Fleming j other than \u25a0 the fact
that , he .'. was . not on duty when Ward
visited ii the ., hospital. . , It is â¢ understood
that his difficulties with Julia Kane,
superintendent of nurses, and Florence
Dakin,. instructress of nurses, 1 had noth
ing to dojwith Fleming's undoing. ."
The Aboard \ 'received * notification " from
Auditor Baehr' that the salary demands
of f Mrs. Bertha Hlnkle, factory and
workship inspector, \ and H. D. Miller,
bath and 'laundry : inspector, and Miss
G. C. Meinke, office \ attendant; had been
held" up becausa they are not civil ser
vice employes, as ; the budget requires.
Baehr has also .withheld, payment of the
salaries jof E. . G. Kendall, laboratory as
sistant, and B: ;A; Bolmen* .janitor, be
cause funds specifically provided for
their- employment Is . only 5100 per month,
whereas. their demands aggregate $135.
The protest against the establishment
of a stable by ; A. B. Clute on- Jersey
street/ near Church, was referred to the
