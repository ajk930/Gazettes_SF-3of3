' The following statement -was ob
tajned from the- War Office at 10
o'clock Thursday night: Â¦
"General Kuroki's armv crossed in
force to the right bank of the Taltse
River and it therefore became neces
sary for the Russians to be in a posi
tion to repel a blow in this direction/ i
"In . view of this development in the
operations General Kuropatkin decided
to abandon -his positions on the left
bank and to concentrate"' his whole
army on the other side of the river."
This position is the stronger both in
character and in site. The, great issue
will be finally decided there.
"By withdrawing to this position the
Russian army avoids the danger of be
ing divided by the river, and enjoys the
advantage of- compactness.
"General Kuropatkin's move, there
fore, is not ' to be considered as a re
treat, but rather as the carrying out of
a well-defined idea."/ ,';
- The withdrawal of the Russians to
the right' bank involved the'abandon
'ment of Liaoyang, which is situated "on
the left bank. The Japanese took ad
vantage^of this to occupy the city/ but

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 2, 1:26 a.
m. â The news of the .evacuation of
Liaoyang and the withdrawal of the
Russian army to the right bank of the
Taitee River reached only 'a small sec
tion of the people of St. Petersburg at
a late hour and caused Intense excite
ment .and'- disappointment.
The majority of the Inhabitants re
tired to' rest/ believing that Russian
arms had again been, successful and
that the Japanese had been re
pelled. Ugly suspicions, however, have
been rife during the day owing to the
absence of press telegrams from Liao
yang, leading to the belief .that the
communications had been cut by Gen
eral Kuroki.

MUKDEN, Sept. 1.â General Kuropatkin'. has abandoned .his heavily fortified position at Liaoy^ng and retired with his entire army to the north bank of the Taitse River to meet
the advance of General Kuroki, who crossed the Taitse-twenty miles to the eastward andjat once advanced to-cut the -Russian-line of communications. The fate of the Russian arrriy
hinges on the result of the battle with Kuroki's legions. Should the Russian arms triutnph, Kuroki would in .turn be placed in a critical position, as the Japanese forces are .now
divided. Communication with Kunopatkin's headquarters has been interrupted since nightfall and it is believed that Japanese scouts have succeeded in cutting the wires.

ST. PETERSBURG, , Sept. 1.â The
battle yesterday was' of the;most'des

the -slaughter must have been Immense.
At 8 o'clock In the evening, after, holdr
ing his outer positions all day in the
face of the most desperate charges,
General Kuropatkin gave the order to
retire upon the main works about, the
city. The Japanese assaults during the
day had been directed 'principally
against the Russian 'center," a little east
of Mactung Hill; near the railroad, and
three miles southwest of Llaoyahg. '
Nothing approaching the severity, of
the infantry and artillery fife here had
been heretofore experienced in "this
war. . General Kondratsvlich's division
bore the brunt and suffered the most.
Bayonet charges succeeded one an
other in rapid succession, while the' ar-'
tillery duel never ceased for a moment.
Â¦ No attempt was made in the official
advices to estimate the number of guns
the* Japanese used, except , : that [%, they,
had many hundreds. Each ; gun carHe3'
150 charges and these must have been
expended many . times, as i several hun
dred thousand shells were fired between
sunrise and sunset. \

were bursting constantly. It seemed

MESSAGE FRQ3I: STbESSEL*
War scarred veterans scarce believe
the stories which come from the seat
of war and declare that it is -beyond
human endurance for an army to fight
without respite for a week, each day
of which has exceeded its predecessor
in intensity of struggle and carnival
of "slaughter. Day after day the thou
sands of dead bestrewing the battle
fields have to be removed. The Jap-"
anese have invented new methods to
incinerate, the heaps of dead com
rades, removing the ashes for the
honors of burial in Japan. The
wounded present a most serious prob
lem, as they tax the transportation
capacities on both sides to the utmost.
,Thjs.-mjQs.t ..dlfficjilt. problem _which.
has^ occurred is the bringing up of
foocl supplies and ammunition to
every point of the fighting line, which
extends from ten to twenty miles.
/ Never has such bombardment been,
known. An eye-witness of the battle
of Vafangow said that many officers
suffered nervous prostration following
the terrible roar of the "artillery and
one military attache had to be in
valided home for the same reason.
Yet the artillery fire at Vafangow
was far inferior in intensity to that at
Liaoyang. . ';;
A telegram from a correspondent at
Mukden, filed at., >9:27' o'clock on the
evening of September 1, stated that the
train service . between Â¦ Mukden ' and
Liaoyang had been Interrupted, but the
dispatch did not mention whether the
telegraphic communications were open.
The action of the Japanese com
mander in throwing a force across
the Taitse in the face of a strong
enemy is considered to be extremely
rash, and the position of this force,
isolated from the main Japanese army
by a deep river, may easily become
desperate.
A - correspondent at Vladivostok
telegraphs that the Japanese are re
lying on the aid of the -gunboat flo
tilla for future operations against
Liaoyang and Mukden. The gunboats,
the correspondent says, have, not yet
materialized,* but in any. case they
would be-in" no position to render aid
to a force on the right bank in time of
need, because they would- be unable
to.. run, the . gauntlet, of;,,, the forts at
: L4adyang..r.. -The -strongest .forts are
situated on.the^right bank, where the
Russian army is now. concentrated.. Â£i â¢
. v. Thejflgtiting at Liaoyang has beaten
all, records, for the desperate valor of
the r assailants, and ( the invincible slub
bQrnness.of the defenders. . The whole
history of warfare tells of no such
bombardments, no such carnage and
no such persistency. Day after day
the fight has been resumed at day
break and kept up with hardly a
moment's intermission until after
nightfall. Â¦'â¢ '^v
The absence of press telegrams from
Liaoyang on September 1 aroused sus
picions that changes ',;- ..of importance

censors did hot wish to be ma'de

their lines were thrown into confusion.

found these death traps filled with dead
and dying.
BATTLE ENDS AT MIDNIGHT.
The rattle of musketry and the boom
of cannon continued until midnight,
when at last silence brooded over the
bloody battlefield and the tired soldiers
lay down where they had fought, whila
the worn-out surgeons and angels of
mercy ministered to the wounded all
night and .the. Chinese coolies worked
at carrying them into Liaoyang. : vv;

.Victory was in. the balance and the
.Liaoyang battle was a draw when the
â¢ Â¦weary soldiers bivouacked last (Wed
nesday) night.
. Following the preliminary successes
of the 2'Jlh, -.-south of Liaoyang, Field
Marshal Marquis Oyama, the com
mander of the Japanese forces in the
field, promptly sent the united armies
forward and at dawn of August 30 a
desperate attack upon all the Russian
positions was made.
The Japanese found the Russians
holding a long chain of splendidly for
tified -positions, with a tremendous force
of artillery. The Japanese artillery
opened the way. but these preliminary
attacks generally failed to give an op
ponunity for an open assault.
The Japanese First Army, after'oc
cupying, the right bank of the L#an
River oh August 27, continued Its for
ward movement and renewed the as
cault against the remaining Russian
positions at Hungshaling, where the
enemy held out the longest and the
most stubbornly. They finally took the
Russian positions at this place and on
an eminence north of Sunchiassai. Fol
lowing these successes the Japanese
.immediately advanced, driving back
the small . bodies of Russian soldiers
cent out to impede their movement.
RUSSIANS DRIVEN FROM RIDGE.
From the night at August 27 to the
morning of the. 29th the Japanese at
tacked .the Russian positions on the
ridge to the. east of Sanyutzu. The-
Russians finally were dlsjodged from
these ridge positions^ but the Japanese
..left "was unable to advance on account
of the forceful resistance â¢ made by the
Russian '. troops who occupied the
heights to- the southeast of Hslang
.ehant-zu. Two divisions of Russians,
which previously had been driven from
Hanpolin,. crossed a bridge constructed
over the Taitse River to the north of
slaotantzu- and retreated to the right
bank of the river.
â¢ Continuing the attack, the Japanese
center 'advanced and occupied a line
extending from Sanyutzu to the west
Â¦"of Shihchutzu. while the left, on the
morning of the 29th, after dislodging
the Russians at Tashihmenling and
SiancFhantzu, advanced to x Yayutai
/and Terischlafangr, where it was rein
forced. *
;"'.- The Russians checked the advance
of all the Japanese forces coming up
. from the south along the Halcheng
. Uaoyang road.
The Japanese resumed the attack on
the 29th. The Japanese right took, a
line, extending from Leichapao to Hel
nluchuang, while the left occupied a
line from a point west of Helniuchuang
to ' Yayutai. A detached column from
. the Japanese right advanced toward
Weljagouand co-operated with the left
column of the First Army.
Â¦â¢The Russians on the Hiacheng-Liao
' yang road appeared to be occupying a
line of ridges extending from a point
south of Shoushanpao to a point east
-of Hangchiatun and running through
HElr.lin.tun. These eminences were
â¢It is the opinion here that the Rus
sians not able to carry many guns
with them and that they were forced to
.abandon or destroy vast quantities of
stores.
To-night ro estimates are obtainable
of the losses on either . side. Field
Marshal Ovama describes, his losses in
the morning assault as heavy. The
early success of the attack was some
what unexpected on- account of the
strength of the Russians and the na
ture of the-.Russiari defenses. It is con
fidently believed that Field Marshal
Oyama -w ill press the pursuit with des
pt'rate vigor arid inflict on General Ku
ropatkin the most crushing blow pos
sible. It is believed that his trophies
will â¢' prove- valuable.
The details of to-day's fighting are
scanty. It- Is only known that at dawn
to-day Gesera! Oku's army was hurled
against the Russian right center on
the southern line and that the Rus
sians were forced to abandon their line
and positions and retreat. The, pursuit
is now in progress. This pursuit and
the result of the fierce battle waged on
the eastern line, where General Kuroki
is assailing the" force which has long
screened Liaoyans. together with the
abandonment of the Russian right cen
ter on the southern line, expose the
Russian left." But here the Russian
force is so" heavy that it may be able
Â¦to! protect and extricate itself.
The question of the occupation of
Liaoyang .by the Japanese is in doubt.
The official dispatches do not make
mention of such occupation, but it is
assumed that the Russians are with
drawing through Liaoyang and that
The Japanese possibly occupied it late
to-day. .
TOKIO, Sept. . 1, S p. m.â Tokio rings
with, shouts and cheers for victory at
Liaoyang. " Lantern-bearing crowds
swing through the streets and surge
around the staff offices shouting, â¢"Ban
zai."
The Russian positions. at .all points
were strongly fortified and the auxiliary
defenses blocked infantry' "attacks."
During the night' of 1 August" 30" the
Russians at Shoushanpao attacked the
Japanese left and repulsed that portion
of the left which occupied Shaoyanzui.
They also made a night attack upon
the ridge south of Shoushanpao.
On the morning of August 31 both
armies renewed the attack with- vigor.
By a late hour in the afternoon neither
contestant had gained any visible re
sult. The Japanese were holding Teng
chiafang and Tsfangtun and. fighting
bravely against superior .forces.
A portion of the Japanese" right-suc
ceeded in capturing an eminence to the
west of Hsinlintun at noon of the 31st.
The operations of 'the day did not
succeed in developing the - Russian
strength in all directions. Bythe-con
atant arrival of reinforcements it was
seen that the guns at Shoushanpao
alone finally numbered 100.-
The Russians -used machine guns
against the Japanese with effect and
the Japanese were unable to press their
attacks home.
During the day the Japanese- left
wing 'was reinforced with a detchment
from the reserves.
The Japanese artillery which at
tacked the Russian left reached Wan
grerhtun at 2 o'clock in the afternoon
and.iKHired a. fire into the rear of the
Russians at Shoushanpao..*
MACHINE GUAS. EFFECTIVE.
The main force of the Japanese right,
with a portion of the left, attacked the
southern Russian line In the neighbor
hood of Hanpchiatun and Hsinlintun,
and opened the attack against '. the
ridges west of Hsinlintun with a vigor
ous shelling. The Russians defended
these positions against this preliminary
attack with energy, and did not allow
an opportunity for an open assault.
The main force of the Japanese left
occupied positions extending " from
Matowle to Tachaochiatai and attacked
the Russians to the west, of Shou
shanpao.
fortified stronglv and occupied ' by a
numerous force of the enemy. The Jap
anese bivouacked -the night of August
29 in front of these positions.
SLAVS HOLD THEIR POSITIONS.
At dawn of August 30 all the Jap
anese armies attacked all the Russian
positions on the southern front from a
point north of.Tengchiafang to a point
east of Hangchlatun and to the west of
Hsinlintun and Shoushanpao. The Jap
anese center attacked with all its
strength. The -left column of the First
Army continued the attack upon Teng
chlafang and Yayutai, but the Rus
sians there received reinforcements and
it was impossible to dislodge them.
A separate column was then dis
patched from the right column of the
Second Army and occupied a ridge, to
the south of Tsafangtun, whence it
opened a cannonade upon the enemy at
6 o'clock on the morning of the 30th.
This first artillery attack proved suc
cessful and at 10 o'clock the Russians
having been reinforced from the direc
tion of Llaoyang, made an endeavor to
retake the ground they had lost.
Throughout the afternoon of the 30th
additional reinforcements reached :Â¦ the
Russians, until their strength was esti
mated at two divisions and fifty or
â¢sixty guns. " â¢. â¢
The Japanese continued to attack
desperately and at 5 o'clock In the af
ternoon a junction was effected, with
the left column of the First Army.. The
Russians were dislodged from Tsafang
tun and that vicinity.
The Russians fought with dogged de
termination until nightfall.
CHEFU. Wednesday, Aug. 31.â Severe
fighting occurred at -Port Arthur on
August 27, when the Japanese, moving
from Shuishiying". attempted to capture
Palungshan, which is south of Shui
shiying and west of the railroad. The
Japanese made two assaults between
4 and 8 o'clock in the morning. They
were repulsed both times. A prisoner,
subsequently taken, places their loss
at 1045 killed and wounded. For one
hour afterward shells were thrown
from Shuishiying into Port Arthur.
The foregoing, information was
brought here to-night by a Chinese who
speaks excellent Russian and who was
employed at the police' station in Port
Arthur, which place he left in the
evening of August 29. He adds that
up to his departure no further attack
had been made by the Japanese on
Palungahan. He confirms previous re
ports that the Russians had reoccupied
Etzshan, where there has been but
little fighting recently.
At 4:30 o'clpck on the morning of
August 28 the Japanese attacked Fort
Number 6, on the northeast portion of
the right flank. This fort is a new and
strong one. After three hours' fierce
firing, during which the Japanese en
dured a crossfire from Fort No. 2, the
Japanese succeeded. . Jri entering the
fort.
When the Russians were safely away
from Fort 6 and the - Japanese flag
waved over.it se\;eral forts concen
trated their fire on.it and the Japanese
were compelled to retire.
Heavy firing was heard by the Chi
nese on the night of August 29.
The Russians continued to iio^d an
eminence west of Shpushanpao and de
fled all efforts to dislodge them.' The
eminence was finally taken" by storm

In' the Si herf case the jury acted
quickly. TÂ»r. Bacigalupi was called to
.describe the location and nature of the
bullet wound in Schultze's body.! The
murdered man's little daughter, who
witnessed the shcoting. also testified.
Arthur Murphy, who tried to shield
Scherf hy. hiding the weapon with
which the shobtiss was dene, was al?o
rjuestioned.- The Jury then decided that
there were ruff.Hent grounds to charge
Scherf With murdor." â¢
Attorney Murphy maintains that the
loA'er courts appointed by the charter
have ViO power in felony cases and that
their jr*^.diction is limited to misde
rr.fAn'ir cat?*- The attorney claims
that Pc-'.iye Judges are usurping powers
which arc granted lÂ»y the State to Jus-
U<+s of the Peace. This is a point
which has not been raised before. The
question -will be fought out when the
v.rit is returned to Judge Cook.
The care of Scherf will now go to
th* Superior Court without a hearing
in th<= Police Court. Most of the ses
sion cf the Grand Jury was taken up
by.' Â£.Â¦ hÂ«?sring of the charges of Marc
Aufer.blic-k . against Police Commis-

' After briefly Questioning four - ;t
nfFses in the cafe the Grand Jury yes
tenJay afternoon indicted Gustave J.
Sch<?rf, a poundman, for the murder of
Ruiolf \VT. Schultze on August 24. The
preliminary examination of Scherf.
which began in Judge Cabaniss' court
yesterday rftorr.ing, was stopped by an
unprecedented proceeding.
Frank J. Murphy, attorney for the
pcur.dman, secured a writ from Supe
rior Judge Cook restraining the Judge
of the lower court from holding the ex
amination on the ground that Police
Judges have no Jurisdiction in felony
case*. Tb** writ is made returnable to
Judge Cock on September 12. Because
of this v.rit Judge Cabaniss continued
the Scherf; hearing until September 15.
The Police Court Judge is ordered to
>hu\v why he should nut be perma
nently restrained from holding an ex
amination in this case.

seth, secretary of the Coast Sailors'
Union, claims to have been damaged
to tht extent of $205,000 by the Pacific
Mail Steamship. Company, from which
he seeks to recover that amount. Furu

Chinese sailors from the steamship Si
beria to the big liner Manchuria.
The complaint contains 205 counts,
one for each of the crew, and $1000 dam
ages is claimed in each allegation. It
is set forth that the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company, contrary to law, Im
ported the Chinese under contract to

the action of the Mail Company his
complaint fai!s to explain. ' .--^

Mayor Warren -Olney announced to
day that an offer of 2^ per cent- pre
mium had been made to him by a pros
pective purchaser of the projected pub
lic improvement. bonds. This tender is
made on the basis of the sale of the
entire Issue, amounting to J2.492.000, of
forty-year bonds, with 4 per cent in
terest. The offer is, significant of the
standing that the city of Oakland main
tains in the large financial circles.
The Mayor expressed great- satisfac
tion concerning the tender. He said it
indicated that there would be a lively
demand for the bonds should they be
voted. His Honor pointed. to the large
premium, but added that he was even
hopeful that a better, bid might be ob
tained.
Of the general effect of this Informal
tender. Mayor Olney said:
It ic gratifying to know that tlr?rÂ« Is such
a demand for our municipal sÂ«>curJties. Whl!e
I am not at liberty at present jo dizcluse th?
Identity of tho bidder. I am thorouihly satis
fled t>x to the reliability of thÂ«> offer. That
2'i per r^nt nromiviin nhould tw; offered on a
4 Vtr cent bond Issue Is a splendid cerd for
thiÂ» city. It means that investors have a su
preme ('onfidrnce in Oakland.
Kurther than that It shows that thÂ« bond
project as a whoie is received with favor.
Municipal bond buyers will not Invest 1h
bonds that are issued on doubtful projects.
They must bÂ» assured of the value of the
works contemplated. They must be confident
of the intrinsic merits of the scheme. It
speaks well f.or our city In -that regard as well.
With this offer as ft starter I feel sum that
our bonds will be literally cobbled up .as soon
as they can be put en sale.. â¢

In a dream there came to John M.
Morris a few nights ago a vision of
his approaching sudden death. To
day Morris' wife returned to their
home at 30 Telegraph av&ue to flnd
her husband's lifeless body. The
warning had been verified.
Morris was in the employ of the^
Southern Pacific Company. For some
time he had been ailing and depressed.
Several days ago he startled his wife
with the story of the dream. Morris
said his Impending death had been re
vealed to him while he slept. So re
alistic did the message seem to the
man that he could not shake off the
feeling that his end was near.
Mrs. Morris left the house early
this morning to go to San Francisco
Â¦on an errand. When she departed her
husband seemed a bit gloomy, but as
that had been his condition for several
days the wife was not unusually anx
ious. She returned at 2 o'clock this
afternoon and found Morris lying on ;
a bed. He did not respond to her call
and the woman's quick Investigation
disclosed that the call of death had
been made. Coroner Mehrmann took
charge of the case.
Dr. Henry Fine h^ld an autopsy
this afternoon, which showed that
heart disease was the cause of death.
Morris was 60 years old, a native of
New York. He leaves no children.
An inquest will be held to-morrow.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Sept. 1.
Following the signing of the death
certificate by Dr. W. W. Allen in the
case of little Myrtle Conklin. the child
who died yesterday from lockjaw, al
leged to have been caused by vaccina
tion, Coroner Mehrmann gave his con
sent to-day to the burial of the body.
This action is taken as being the close
of the incident, for 'now there will be
no Coroner's inquest and no more prob
ing into the cause of the child's death.
The certificate signed by Dr. Allen
describes death as having been caused
by lockjaw, following vaccination. In
this description Dr. F. R. Woolsey, the
vaccination officer, who vaccinated the
child, agreed during a consultation
with Dr. Allen. Both doctors having
agreed as to the cause of death, Coro
ner Mehrmann accepted Dr. Allen's
signature to the certificate and declared
that there would be no inquest.
While the doctors interested In the
case have agreed upon a cause of
death, they still hold to their original
opinions regarding the vaccination op
eration. Dr. Allen said to-night that
Coroner Mehrmann's action was a com
pliment to himself, as he had accepted
his diagnosis that death had resulted
from blood â¢ poison following vaccina
tion. Dr." Woolsey, on the other hand,
maintains that the blood poisoning was
not due to the vaccination operation,
but to improper sanitation.
The funeral of, the dead child was
held at 2 o'clock this afternoon from a
local undertaking parlor.
As a result of the feeling against
vaccination C. E. Kinard has taken
steps to test the legality of the require
ment of the State Board of Health that
all school children must be .vaccinated
before they are allowed to attend any
public school and has petitioned the
courts for a writ of mandate to com
pel the City Board of Education, City
Superintendent of Schools McCly
monds and J. H. Pond, as principal of
the High School, Â¦ to allow his three
children admission 'without having ob
served this requirement.
In his petition, filed to-day, he sets
forth* that' he tbok his children to the
school at the beginning of the present
term and asked .that they be admitted,
which, was refused' on the ground that
they had "riot" been' vaccinated. He states
that there is no" immediate remedy at
hand and therefore asks that the courts
take the matter up and order those
having charge of the school system
to give his children admission to the
school. ,v 7 - .Â¦ -
An anti-vaccination ineeting will be
held in California. Hall to-morrow even
ing to protest against the compulsory
law.

The proposals for playgrounds are made In
response to the urgent requests of many public
spirited citizens and to the silent, but no less
fctrong appeal of Â¦ the " children themselves.
These- playgrounds ore In line with the prac
tice of the older municipality t>, and are found
to be both valuable and necessary; at the same
time their- creation: and maintenance dis
charges in part the obligation due from the
municipality toward the childhood within Its
Â¦ borders. . â¢
The necessty for. expenditures on sewers,
culverts and crosswalks Is so self evident as
t-> need 'neither explanation nor defense.
As to. the Polytechnic School, the committee
first made an investigation to satisfy itself
as to the value and character of the work.
As compared with results obtained under lim
ited . conditions, if no other consideration pre
vailed, then as a pure business proposition the
additional -Kocd to be obtained fuily Juslltiea
the proposed Investment.
. Finally, there Is left the proposal to pur
chase property on the present City Hall block
and > to erect a new public building In sire
sufficient for present needs, but of such â¢ de
sign as will admit of. additions, while pre
serving the same architectural features. .
., Sometimes we hear the statement that It
were better to sell the. valuable small area of
City Hall Park and purchase a larger and
less expensive location, .thereby avoiding the
necessity, for an Increased . Investment in land
at the present site. New York did not move
Its: City Hall from Us downtown location, not
withstanding the very great value of Its City
Hall Park. .
- In relation to . our main . thoroughfares no
better site may be found, ami .In. view .or. th*
agitation i for : consolidating Â¦ Alameda, > Oakland
and Berkeley, > surely its geographical position
could not be Improved. The additional area will
?Â».rtalnly. be needed. â¢ The ' deferment of , pur
chase means â¢ the payment of a filghsr price
In future, \ the new public building should ulti
mately be fittingly displayed and not spoiled
by its immediate surroundings.

Independence Park, likewise, a gift, "has
stood for years a monument of official neglect.
Occupying an elevated and beautiful position,
it has remained for years unimproved, un
ornamental and useless for the purposes for
which It was given and Intended.
I PLAYGROUNDS AND HALL.
Passing next to the smaller areas:
In the De Fremery property we have op
portunity of purchasing a tract that stands
alone In the preservation of the original and
wildly natural conditions that prevailed in
Oakland before the march of improvement re
moved them. â¢ At slight expense this area can
be made a most delightful resort for that sec
tion in West Oakland that stands so much In
need of beautifying, and there Is the certainty
that It will be best appreciated when it is
opened to nubile use. . -
Bushrod Park, a gift to the city, stands In
Its unimproved condition and needs to front
on what will always be the main thoroughfare
between this city and Berkeley. To that end
It Is advisable to purchase the' land inter
vening between its eastern entrance and .Tele
graph avenue and to spend at present a mod
erate amount in its development for the grati
fication of the residents in that district.
The Council felt that' at this time it was
not justified In . going further in Its recom
mendations, nevertheless it Is firmly con
vinced that if these projects are adopted and
completed some one of Its near successors will
put before the people the scheme for its com
pletion by acquiring the remaining two sec
tions of lake shore frontage, viz: Between
the lake and Twentieth street on the west
and around : that portion on the north known
a9 'Adams Point.
5. To complete on the boulevard plan that
portion of Harrison street lying between Twen
tieth and Twenty-fourth streets. â'Â¦*-.:*â¢
4. To purchase land between Twelfth and
Lake streets and east of Oak on the western
shore of Lake Merritt and to suitably improve
it for park purposes.
3. To finish the East Lakeside boulevard
to the lake head and to continue It at greater
width to form a "panhandle," and thus reach
the southern entrance of thÂ« proposed Central
Park. This would have the effect of trans
ferring the park entrance to the head of Lake
Merritt. â¢ -
1. It Is proposed to deepen the shallow
water ofLake Merritt and make it available
over Its entire area. To use the material thus
obtained for raising the present grede of ths
proposed park south of the Twelfth street dam.
This' will be the most easily accessible place
ot deposit and thus most easily accessible place
accomplished* at a minimum of expense.
2. To convert the unsightly area south of
the Twelfth street dam Into one of ornament
and use.
In other cities artificial lakes are ; crsated
with infinite labor and cost. Here in our
midst is a salt water lake provided by nature,
and it needs but the proper acquisition and
improvement of adjacent land to produce a
result that does not anywhere else exist and
one that will prove a source of pride and
pleasure to the citizens of Oakland forever.
It is this water park with its ample area of
about 160 acres that the committee used as
the basis for developing the comprehensive
park scheme that Is now presented.
LAKE MERRITT PLANS.
Cities do not part with public park prop
erties, and people everywhere would resent' at
tempts to deprive them of these facilities for
pleasure. I speak not In disparagement of
the smaller and scattered breathing place*, but
more. particularly in favor of the larger areas
for the masses and which are a crowning
glory to every" city, that possesses them. What
is. there in San Francisco that equals , Golden
Gate Park, that affords so much pleasure to
its Inhabitants and so much attraction' to- Us
visitors? Does that .municipality regret Its
Investment, that produced such a beautiful re
sult out of the most unpromising -materials
and conditions? â¢
The proposals now before you are such as
can be encompassed, and in our examination
of their necessity or advisability let us ad
dress ourselves to the projected park systems,
which appear to need both advocacy and de
fense against narrow and thoughtless criti
cism.

It must be remembered that on s the subject
of a municipal water supply the condition of
public sentiment was such that, in Its recom
mendation to the Council, the committee felt
the need of putting a limit upon Its pro
pcsals. That limit was fixed at $2,MK).0O0, which
would leave a possible $5.000.0CO of bonds
available in future to provide for such water
supply and system as might commend itself

The meeting- was called to -order by
Edwin Stearns, president of the fed
eration. Principal P. M. Fisher of the
Polytechnic High School was elected
chairman. After briefly expressing his
views upon this subject, he Introduced
Councilman John L. Howard, chair
man of the special committee that
framed the bond issue. Mr. Howard
gave the first official statement of the
bond proposition as follows:
It could hardly be expected that the bond
ing, scheme recently prepared by the City
Council would perfectly lit the ideas ot all
classes of our citizens; Indeed, It is fairly sus
ceptible of Improvement in some respects, but,
taking all the circumstances and limitations
that surrounded its authors, it is probably as
good a project as could have been devised, and
with this feeling on the part of the\ govern
ment, it Is. submitted to your favorable con
sideration.
OAKLAND, Sept. 1.â The opening
meeting of the campaign for bonds was
held at the Masonic Temple this even
ing under the auspices of the Progress
Federation. The principal speakers
were Councilman John L. Howard and
Colonel John P. Irish. Success was pre
dicted for the carrying of the proposed
measure, but it was also considered
necessary to do a' certain amount of
missionary work to insure its passage.
Other speakers were G. W. Langan
and P. J. Keller. Notice was given
that" meetings are to be held from now
on until the election.
A vote of thanks was also passed to
City Engineer Turner for the prepara
tion of a large map upon which are
marked the nieces of land proposed to*
be purchased for park sites.
Following Howard, Cplpnel John P.
Irish was called upon, and began his
remarks by complimenting the city
upon having a man of Councilman
Howard's ability who was willing to
devote so much of his time to its wel
fare, and he made a motion that a
resolution of thanks be passed for the
paper Mr. Howard had prepared. En
tering upon a discussion of his subject,
Colonel Irish designated a few points
which seemed of importance to him.
By reference to a map he pointed out
that leaving out the foothill park, East
and "West Oakland are about evenly
balanced in regard to benefits to be re
ceived by the establishment of parks.
This was in answer to a feeling which
he said existed in his part of the town.
West Oakland, where it was .stated
most of the property was being bought
for East Oakland.
Another point he made was that
eventually the big foothill tract would
call for the establishment of a like
park in West Oakland, and that in a
few years he would not be surprised to
see a park in West Oakland which
would connect bv boulevards with the
foothill tract. In speaking of the bene
fit to be derived from a bond issue he
Illustrated his remarks by stating that
a few years ago, when a similar propo
sition, was before the people, he had
bonded a tra^ct of 160 acres, of marsh
land in West Oakland, to be purchased
in case the bonds measure passed for
$60,000 for the establishment, of a park.
"To-day you cannot buy that land' for
twice $60,000," he said. "This will show
you how the value of property is en
hancing and 'why we should buy this
land when it is cheap. The improve
ments â¢ themselves aid in raisins the
valuer of the property." â¢
Let us not -deceive ! ourselves that we ' haro
had the full measure needed of tbfs public
spirit, otherwise the beauties and the advan
tages of our situation would have been more
availed of than they have been. . .
They will appeal strongly to that public
spirit which believes in focusing the maximum
amount of Intelllzent work and. the minimum
amcunt of talk upon all measures that promise
good to the city.
Â¦ They solicit the . support of those who be
lieve that no good can come to the whole city
unless that good Is shared by all Its parts.
Regarding the projects submitted for bonds,
no claim for originality is made on the part
of the council.
AH of them and more are self-evident propo
sitions. In some form or other all of them
have been discussed, and tcose that are of
fered are the limited and official i elections
that should commend themselves on the ground
of necessity or expediency.
They will not appeal to the unprogresstve
or to the sectionalism
What advantage was derived by Alameda
or Berkeley for their contributions to the
county?
I do not contend that under a consolidation
the total of these contributions would be saved
to the united cities, but it may with safety
be said that under a wise and clean adminis
tration an astonishingly targe percentage
could be saved and devoted to purposes in
which the three municipalities have an Imme
diate and direct interest.
To those of us who must tonslder the fact
that the needs of our city and the demands
of. its departmental heads grow In a faster
ratio than our Income, a perplexing problem
Is presented. For the present we must con
tent ourselves by compelling the expenditures
to be kept within the resources. This process
cannot be continued indefinitely or suffering
will ensue and the remedy we see before us
U the abolition of the expensive Incubus of the
present county government.
.During last year the valuation of Oakland
property was increased 20 per cent and upon
this augmented assessment tne contribution
by Us tax-paying citizens for county pur
poses was .809 cents, or more tnan $400,000.
What proportion of it was spent for the
benefit of Oakland?
artÂ» the aue.tton. What will be the effect of
this .bonding Â«cheme upon Â«Â«> taxpayer.
It la proposed to lssuÂ« 12.500.000 Â» f * Â£1

Payments will be |S1.260l or a yearly total or
JU3.75O. equal to |2 27* per thousand on a U

It must not be hastily conclud fV,rin* the

we have reason to expect a rapid yÂ«rly Â«â¢-
Cr if*BecauBe the table of assessable value* of
the city shows a gradual Increase. .
2. Because, with the completion of _ J nes *
public Improvements, history cannot fair io
repeat Itself In respect of accelerating ine
Increase In taxable values, not merely M io
properties Immediately adjacent to them, dui
also values throughout tne city will appre
ciate in sympathy with the general upward
movement. "_.,. ,
8. It is exoected that our dtlaens will feel
the necessity for an early change In our char
ter provisions In regard to the making of as
sessments. It is clearly apparent that with
the adontion of a better system and its busi
nesslike prosecution there will result a more
equable distribution V>f the municipal burden
and a very appreciable increase In the total
assessed Valuation. . .
Given a. low tax rate and a wise municipal
administration and your city will commend
itself to the favorable consideration of cap
ital.
From the three reasons advanced one Is Jus
tified In the belief that the total value as
sersed in the city of Oakland should reach
between $65,000,000 and 170,OW,000 by the year
1910, and of course with each increase of
$1,000,000 in the value of taxable property be
yond the $50,000,000 assumed there will bÂ« a
ratable diminution in the $2 27% per thousand
before referred to.

A Judgment for J4000 with interest
was rendered by Judge Seawell yester
day for the plaintiff in the case of
Miller & Lux against the Kern Coun
ty Land Company. The plaintiffs sued
for $25,000 -damages-because the de
fendants, successors to. the interest of
J. B. Haggin, had constructed a. dam
in Buena Vista Lake, which" prevented
the Miller & Lux interest from taking
water through a canal to irrigate 4000
acres of land.

W. P. A. Brewer of the San Mateo
Dairy, charged by* the Health Board
with having adulterated his cream,
complained to Health Officer Ragan
yesterday that an injustice . had been
done him. Brewer admitted having
a package of thickening on his prem
ises, but said it was a sample and had
never been used. Ragan said that the
inspector* who had taken a sample of
cream from Brewer's place had ne
glected to give a duplicate sample to
Brewer for private analysis and thinks
Brewer may have some ground for
complaint on that score only. It also
appears that Haas Brothers were
innocent of any wrongdoing and
merely handled Murphy & Paul's
cream, which was adulterated.
Sample Was Not Duplicated.
Coroner Leland held an inquest yes
terday upon the body of Charles
Lewis, a lather, who died at the Cen

23 of hemorrhage of the brain. The
Jury returned a verdict that Lewis
came to his -death by a fall caused

rel had existed between the accused

while intoxicated, having persisted in
abusing Whealahan. They met In a
bÂ»er saloon and upon Lewis proceed
ing to abuse Whealahan again, the
latter struck him a violent blow on

To Whom It May Concern:
Interested parties, not members of the
Citizens' Alliance, are circulating stories
that an effort will be made by it to break
up the Labor day parade.
Casual investigation as to the source
of the story leads me to lay the respon
sibility of its origin (and circulation) to
certain labor politicians interested in
their own ends; and, once and for all. I
wish to say the Citizens' Alliance stands
for. law and order, good citizenship and
industrial equilibrium. It denies no man
the right to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness, and if it makes a union
man happy to parade that is his business
and not ours. It is his right and the
Government of the United States guar
antees him peaceful enjoyment of that
right. Just as it assures Knights Tem
plar or any other fraternity protection.
The Citizens' Alliance of San Fran
cisco is made up of 16,000 of our very
best people, who represent eighty-flve
per cent of the commercial and profes
sional energy of this city. It seems like
a waste of time to deny the silly story;
but the Citizens' Alliance, through me.
desires to say to the honest" toilers of
the city. God bless you. go ahead and en
joy yourselves and rest assured we sin
cerely trust nothing will happen to mar
the pleasure of the occasion.
HERBERT GEORGE. Pres.
After the reading of several pro
pressive reports concerning the work
and passing of the character of the
preachers the meeting adjourned un
til 9 o'clock this morning.
In the evening "a missionary anni
versary was held, addressed by S.
Sugihara and Herbert B. Johnson.
â¢'I have no doubt as to the ultimate
outcome of the war in. the Far East
and I firmly believe that the Japanese
will be the. leaders' of civilization
there." . This optimistic statement
was made by Dr. F. D. Bovard at the
opening of the Japanese Methodist
conference yesterday morning. Dr.
Boyard was among the first to p'roph
osy success for th-e Japanese array.-
The conference was opened with

.Dr. Fisher, formerly of the Pacific
Advocate, told of the success of the
r>ork among the Japanese on this
coast. Ten years ago, he said, the
workers started' in Portland with
nothing. Since that time they have
purchased an $8000 building on which
hut $2000 remains to be "paid. In ad
dition to- this the Japanese have made
liberal contributions to the war fund.
Filcher is a fruit grower and is en
tirely familiar with the fruit of Cali
fornia, having acted several times as
representative of this State at world's
fairs at Buffalo, at Belgium, at At
lanta and he was at Paris when the
Southern Pacific Company exhibited
California products at an exposition.
He has been manager of the California
State Board of Trade ' several years.
All this experience has fitted him to
know whether the quality of fresh fruit
that is sent from California to St.
Louis is up to the standard. Emphati
cally he declares that' it is not, a fact
strongly emphasized by the correspond
ence of The Call at; St. Louis. States
that are not in the class with California
are reported to be making a better fruit
display than this ; State is.
When Barry was directed to commu
nicate with fruit growers of Northern
and Central California and to take the
steps necessary to get the real goods he
went to Sacramento to confer with the
Executive Committee of the Sacra
mento Valley Development Association.
Since then, so Mr. Barry says, he has
learned through Secretary Beard of
the Sacramento Vallev Development
Association that some fruit growers
have written to the association In re
sponse to queries that were urgent in
their character that there was no use
for Barry to come to them., One state
ment made by a fruit. grower was that
he objected to sending fruit because
some that had been, forwarded earlier
was credited | to .iSojithern,' \Californla.
Whatever reasons are. -> adduced .. the
Fruit growers in Northern and Cen
tral California are refusing to '. send
fresh fruit to St. Louis for exhibition,
at the Exposition. â¢ The' California
Commissioners at St. Louis are com
plaining,'but. without avail. The San
Francisco representative of the Cali
fornia Commissioners at St. Louis, un
der instructions, has taken steps to get
fresh fruit to forward for exhibition
purposes, but has become discouraged
and is' no longer striving in that direc
tion. In these three statements are out
lined conditions that are Â¦ somewhat
surprising and disappointing.
Mr. Barry, who represents the absent
commissioners while they are out of
this State, was directed by Commis
sioner J. A. Filcher Borne time ago to
see what could be done to get . good
fruit to show at St. Louis to -advertise
California. A letter was written â¢Â¦/. to
Barry by Filcher in \which bad fruit
that' had been previously forwarded
was characterized as "not fit to be fed
to hogs," and it was averred that the
quantity that was forwarded was as
insufficient as the'qu^allty was bad. .
* It is recommended that laws be
passed preventing a too early maturity
of contracts. It is said that this sort
of business has wrecked some com T
panies and will drive others upon the
rocks if persisted in. The laws creat
ing the board are stated to be insuffi
cient and not clearly defined. It is fur
ther recommended that laws be made
providing for the creation and main
tenance of a reserve fund in all build
ing and loan associations.'
general apathy, so Mr. Barry says, has
discouraged him. One party even rec
ommended that he should go to the
canneries to get the best California
fruit to send to St. Louis. He did not
think that this was the proper and dig
nified wav to get up a California hor
ticultural show. What will next hap
pen is uncertain.
Farmers are forwarding products to
an extent." but the quality of much of
the fruit is still reported to be unsatis
factory. Commissioner Filcher is
fuming at St. Louis because his ef
forts are "Insufficient to induce the
fruit growers to make the best show
they can. Barry is awaiting additional
Instructions at this end of the line,
willing to carrv them out promptly.
The fruit growers are, in the mean
time, wasting a golden opportunity, to
have their products seen bv the Expor
sition crowds. No.one Is collecting
fruit in California In behalf of the Cali
fornia Commission. .
The annual report of the State Build
ing and Loan Commission,' recently
submitted to Governor Pardee. shows
that unusual prosperity exists in Cali
fornia. There has been great progress
in home building during the last year
and all institutions ; engaged in loan
ing money for this purpose are getting
along in splendid shape. The loans
during the last year have increased
$2,046,195 57 and there Is a net gain in
total assets of $1,442,190 30. The shares
in force have increased rrom 564,294 to
620,622 arid memberships from. 63,376 to
59,848. *._ The new loans auring the year
amounted to 7309, making the number
of borrowers 15,205.
There are 126 building and loan as
sociations which submitted reports;
New homes. for 2438 persons were con
structed, making an aggregate of 21,001
buildings erected by loan associations
In the history' of the State. The re
port states that the number of asso
ciations is gradually decreasing, while
the number of -shares increases. This
me.ans that the. large concerns are ab
sorbing the smaller ones. The net per
centage of nrofit on loans is 6.47.

II. "B. Gonzales, \a' colored barber,
dwells with : his v.'hite wife, - a buxom
person, in a fiat on Point Lobos ave
nue, and another flat in the same build
ing is occupied by Robert Collins ' and
wife, both white. Â¦ The two families
have bcrn.at war for some time. \ Not
very long aso Mrs.' Collins and "Go'ri-
Andrew Little, longshoreman, failed
to satisfy Judge Cabaniss that he waÂ»
utterly blameless for the encounter In
which his head was cracked by a black
jack In the hand of J. Phillpo. The
fight occured In the Palma Hotel at
Sansome and Pacific streets and wit
nesses testified that Little was "mak
ing rough house" when Phillpo tried to
stop him with the aid of the blackjack.
So the Judge dismissed the charge of
assault with a deadly weapon which
had been made against Mr. Philipo.
Frank Thompson and Oscar Field,
who stole a gold ring from a Stockton
street Jeweler, were each given six
months by Judge Conlan.
Mrs. Alvido Kurin and Miss Lena
McCann, a pretty 17-year-old lass,
dwell In the same house at 217% Perry
street and Miss McCann had Mrs. Ku
rin arrested for calling her a very un
complimentary name. The girl's com
plaint was corroborated by her mother
and a young lady friend, both of whom
claimed to have -overheard the objec
tionable title. Mrs. Kurin. not only de
nied having used the epithet alleged,
but declared that it had been applied
to her by Miss McCarin. This testi
mony was corroborated by Mrs. John
son, who dwells on Florida street, and
who was ready to swear, if necessary,
that Mrs. Kurin was incapable of ut
tering such language. So flatly con
tradictory was the testimony that there
was nothing else for the Judge to do
than dismiss the case and advise the
ladles to kiss and make up. The advice
seemed to be wasted.
J. J. Paulsell, formerly a police Judge
at Stockton and now a professional
evangelist, was arrested for distribut
ing tracts in Golden Gate Park, and
before Judge .Cabaniss he conducted
his own defense and pleaded a consti
tutional risht to do what he had been
arrested for doing. The municipal or
dinance which he was accused of vio
lating does not harmonize with | the
constitution of the United States, he
argues, as the latter instrument confers
upon the people un trammeled freeiMm
to express and promulgate religious
teaching, irrespective of creed. The
effort to restrain him from circulating
religious literature was, therefore, at
variance with the highest authority In
the land. He proposed to make a test
case of It and If he were convicted he
would appeal to a higher tribunal. The
Judge then, as a matter of form, pro
nounced him gulltv as charged and
stated that he would give himself un
til next Saturday to consider the mat
ter of imposing a fine.
Three little girls, Edith and Essie
Maxton and Etta Shindlcr, were com
plainants against J. Leighter's horse
and Mr. Leighter himself was a de
fendant before Judge Conlan on the
charge of leaving the animal unhitched.
The maidens testified that the horse
was allowed to roam at will in the
vicinity of Sixteenth street and Red
wood court and that while they were
at play it sneaked up behind them,
snatched their straw hats and deliber
ately ate them. Moreover, when they
attempted to rescue their headgear, the
voracious equine snapped at them. Mr.
Leighter denied that the horse was
either starved or vicious of character
and opined that if the youngsters
would let himâ the horseâ alone he
would utterly ignore their hats. Case
continued till September 6 l to afford
Mr. Leighter time to present character
testimony in behalf of the horse.
"I went on making up the bed," she
laughingly replied, "and then I went
to' sleert"
The negro was arrested about twen
ty-four hours later in a bedroom at
tached to the restaurant of A. Carasio,
133" Montgomery avenue. He was ran
sacking the apartment when discov
ered and he crawled underrieath the
bed, whence he was extracted by a
policeman summoned by Carasio. At
the City Prison he was registered as
Elias Linzey. Judge Conlan sent him
to the Superior Court to 'answer for
two charges of burglary.
It was in a perfunctory way, rather
than with expectation of finding the
strange man there, ' that Mrs. Rosie
Franuechi' of 610>Â£ Francisco street
peered underneath her bed last Sat
urday evening. She had done the same
thing every night since her early girl
hood and repeated disappointment had
gradually dispelled her fear, but the
habit remained. So when she finally
discovered him she was as much sur
prised as if she had not always looked
for him Just before retiring to slumber
and in her astonishment she did ex
actly contrary to what she had made
up her mind to do in such a situation.
Instead of screaming for help and
rushing from the apartment, she burst
into song and began arranging the
bedcovers. A deep and prolonged snore
from the intruder indicated that" he
slept and contributed to the woman's
quick recovery of her self-possession.
Then she realized that it would be use
less to call for aid, as nobody was
within hailing distance, and she also
suspected that her uninvited visitor
might be shamming sleep in order to
get her out oÂ£ the room so that he
could plunder it. A weighing of these
facts and probabilities fixed her pur
pose. She accepted the next snore as
her cue for" action.
"Hi, you, in there," she shouted;
"come out and git out!"
The response was a snore deeper and
longer than any of its predecessors.
"Come out 'o that!" she yelled.
Another snore. Then she reached her
hand underneath the bed, grasped a
trousers-leg and Jerked and pulled until
she brought to light a coalblack negro
with a most villainous countenance.
"What's de mattah?" he inquired,
rubbing his eyes.
"You git out 'o here at once!" com
manded Mrs. Franuechi, pointing to
the door.
Without a word the negro walked
out.
"And what did you do then?" asked
Police Judge Conlan, before whom Mrs.
Franuechi recounted her adventure.
For stabbing Francois Coushard with
a knife Jules Lemai, a sailor, was sent
to the Superior Court by Judge Caba
niss. The men had a fight at 78 Jack
son street on August 14.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Judge Conldn dismissed the charge of
battery which had been hanging over
George Rush since July 30. when he en
gaged in a fight with a street-car con
ductor and had a leg broken in a scuf
fle with the policeman who arrested
him.
zales were In the Police Court and yes
terday Gonzales appeared before Judge
Cabaniss as complainant against Col
lins, the charge being disturbance of
the peace. Mrs. Gonzales, the principal
witness for the prosecution, was attired
In a snow-white gown of fluffy ma
terial and unusual circumference and
her hat corresponded to her dress in
both color and width. So relentlessly
did she press .the charge against Col
lins that the Judge fined him $5.

ANSWERS TO QUIRKS.
When Mrs. E. E. Boyer of Potts
ville. Pa., went to rake the fire in the
kitchen range a few days ago she was
startled by an angry hiss at her fee,t.
Stepping back she narrowly avoided
a large blacksriake which wriggled
across the floor.
Remembering that there wa3 a
fickle in the cellar, she secured it and
attacked the snake. It did not retreat
even after she had made a sweep with
the sharp blade, taking off part of
its tail. The fight continued for sev
eral minutes, until Mrs. Boyer. by a
lucky swing of the sickle cut off. the
reptile's head.
The snake is supposed to have
crawled from a mass of rank vege
tation near the house, through the
open door, and to have coiled itself
beneath the stove.
Miss Mary Reynolds of Sibley, Iowa,

Â¦ mr R. OSTRANDER, a mountaineer and pioneer, in a recent letter to
/ \S\ e C^Yi, su ?? OTts a position we have often stated and affirmed. He
-iYl t-ys t hat our forests are to be preserved from destructive fire only
by the conservative use of fire to destroy underscrub and duff. We inherited
our forest* from the Indians, who practiced this conservative use of fire, and
hiade the forests like a park, open and free of "copse. The Indian method is
practically followed" by scientific foresters, who in the public forests of Europe
keep the ground clean of dead trees, undergrowth and duff, using fire prop
erly, when necessary, 'for that purpose. . r
Our forests were subject to lire long before they were seen by civilized
man. The Indians evidently sometimes fired when it was too dry or let the
fire set b?yen<i control. In the Mariposa big tree grove is a giant sequoia
â¢which shows by the flattening of one side extending far. up the column, that
it Â»vai once wounded by fire, but has completely repaired the injury and cov
ered -it with thick bark. Standing within a few feet of it was a large sugar
yir.c. nhicb was felled in the interest of the sequoia, which it was crowding.
The ring* of the tcgar pine were counted and its age, was found to be 800
j ezre, yet *t had no ms.rk of fire.
. This proved that the great fire which smote the sequoia must have oc
curred before the sugar pine existed, probably a thousand years ago. The
.'iCifloii being non-resinous 2nd hard to kindle, a fire that would have in
:;:etr~ vseh sn injury upon it would have destroyed the pitchy sugar pine had
â¢it been standing at- the time. But, notwithstanding such ancient fires, our
fr*re5ts were -ixe'il preserved 10 as. and their protection from destructive fires
::â¢.â¢>â¢ he sought by conservative firing.
* Thi* year onr mountains have been entirety free from forest fires. The
'reason frÂ»r this doubtless ;s that the general conflagrations of the last five
.yezn> have cleaned the forest floor of duff and underscrub, at the same time
destroying ratltidas of Â£ae trees, so -that this year there is but little for fir%
to feed cpoa.
If ike /s*nie' area had "been conservatively cleaned by fires it would be
equally safe sad no trees would have been destroyed.

on the Hearst papers, has finally tired
of the dirtv work that he â¢ was called

ever published for the San Francisco

these is published every day on the edi

statement in his speech of acceptance
that he would not accept renomlnation,
was extraordinarily good.
LIES THE CABTOOflS.
Â¦ '.. Hllfi speech is a to key note" effort, and we hope that the* pace it fixes
will be kept up by his imitators. ' When that host of Southern orators comes
North to aitack the President and make a personal campaign we hope they
will follow Hill in telling the people that it is dangerous to have a President
who has no strings on him. The Republican National Committee should rec
ogv.izc good service and offer to pay Mr. Hill's campaign expenses. He is
doing good work. ..; ... "â¢
*T^HERE are two Hills in the campaign against Roosevelt. One is the
â¢I high financier, the other the low politician. The difference in their alti
*1 rude indicates no difference in their purpose, to wage a personal cam-
a.gamst the President. The politician, the New York Hill, has opened
iis up-State campaign in a speech at a county fair. He argued at length
Â£&st the President, using as his text this statement: The President,
?r-.ror.gh himself and his late private secretary, manages and directs every
cfetail.of the campaign, while experienced political managers of long service
ia the party, are brushed aside and ignored." Thereupon Mr Hill appears
& attorney for the ignored politicians, and bewails their sad fate at great
â¢ "They probably did not know how badly they are being abused until he
5;atcd their case. He appeals to them to rise, throw off their lethargy and
Kick hi ? h. All this is amusing. It is also distinctly Hilhsh. Little Dave, who
nonage's Parker's campaign, knows how he feels when he is not managing
something in politics, and he i. unable to conceive how a candidate for the
Presidency can get alang without takingorders from somebody else
â¢ His candidate shows no symptoms of independence. He irmtes Sheehan
.rmd Murphy and McCarren to call and see him and tell him what to do. He
even invited the notorious Bill Dcvcry to come into counsel with him, and
Bill went. Then the KeW York World, never accused of beuig ~sty nice
about such things, held up its hands in astonishment and exclaimed, "I his is
the limit." Under Kill's management no -manager" has been too unsavory
for conation by Judge Parker, and HiUis the happiest politician in>ew
.York. The campaign on his side is going to .suit him exactly. The man
rgcrs" are rrnning it, and he is running the managers JUnder his adv.ee
Trdse Parker is piling up obligations to the Murphys, McCarrens and Dev
irys which will have to be redeemed if he reach the White House, and in
Mtutii fonxi Hil! will get a rakeoff from them all.
Z*'O He \Â« entirely correct in charging that President Roosevelt is independ
ent nf the influences which have already surrounded Judge Parker, and taken
a' mortage rpon his political future. The President has no intermediary be
tween him and his party and the people. He needs no go-between, for his
Â¦Â¦"rtaster motive is "-2 square deal."
- The politicians and managers of his party understand perfectly that no
"o-e has a first lien upon him, and that in his regard equal merit has equality,
"J0& more no man can ask. Mr. Hill has quite unintentionally paid to the
President the highest. of compliments. The spirit of the times is against inner
c : rc!cs" executive sessions of managers, and covert promises, which mort
age a victory to a few. The people want to feel that their contact with a
candidate is direct, and that their access to a President is to be the same.
President Roosevelt takes the responsibility of his campaign. He advises
"with 'every member of his party who seeks counsel with him, and holds all
ooors open to the people. If there be in the Republican party men of the
character of. McCarren and Devery, they instinctively avoid him, for *e is
ttW a nan with whom they can do business. This marks the capital difference
between President Roosevelt and Judge Parker. The Judge is a man of
good character, but is in bondage to the idea of politics with which Hill has
I'oiiS inoculated New York. He gives himself up to the/'managers," and if
'â¢accident should make him President he would spend a wretched four years
in frying to satisfy the Murphys and Deverys, who are standing guard around
Jinn urder the captaincy of Hill. . ii; .
'Â¦Â¦ It must be said for Hill, however, that the rule he applies to the President
lie applied also to his own party, to its disruption. In 1892 Mr. Cleveland was
.nominated against Tammany and Hill's "snap convention," and he carried
.S'ew York without shaking hands with Bill Devcry or giving Dick Croker
the freedom of his sideboard. For this Hill and the managers never forgave
him. Hill seems to have made up his mind that such a thing shall not hap
pen agaiu. So he has found a candidate, filed a chattel mortgage on him, and
goes forth to tell the people that President Roosevelt is a dangerous man^ be
cause'no one has a lien upon him and none can get a chattel mortgage on
him..
HILL'S ATTACK.
A Tyrolese clockmaker recently in
vented and patented a unique alarm
clock. It is simply a new and original
application of the alarm to the clocks
made in the Black Forest, possessing a'
certain peculiarity which he designates
the Alpine Waker.
.Whenever in the solitudes of the high
pastures the cowherds of the Tyrol
and Switzerland desire to .com i.un'cate
with one another over distances too
far for the voice to carry they maks
use of a sort of wooden drum, upon
which they strike with a wooden ham
mer., thus producing a sound which is
distinctly audible over a long distance.
This custom is the father of the idea.
Just above the dial on the clock will
be found a wooden hammer.- which,
actuated by the alarm movement, beats
upon a thin board, raised an inch from
the face of the clock, as upon a drum,
producing a sound of remarkable .in
tensity, more thrilling indeed than that
of the ordinary metal bell. . . * ;

Its dramatic subject* is an allegory
of the preservation of the redwoods,
the text by Will Irwin. Mr. McCoy
himself conducted,- five numbers of the
music-drama being given. Perhaps
my feeling in the matter is best ex
pressed by what the man behind .me
said: "I did not know McCoy had it in
him." I did not know. Indeed, I doubt
if anything better, or as good, as Mr.
McCoy's first two movements, has been
turned out in California.. Melodic fa
cility,' harmonic inventiveness, the dra
matic quality/ the sustained quality, a
delightful skill in orchestration, are all
Mr. McCoy's* in happiest measure. The
prelude is a charming. specimen' of de
scriptive writing, fertile in fancy, weil
knit, admirably massed. Perhaps even
better is the "Dance of: the Young
Hamadryads," in tho much more cir
cumscribed field - of scherzfl expression.
The McCoy, themes are here thoroughly
original, full of humor and, character.
The, number was delightfully played.
Of course, the women made the day
their own. Belled, booked and candled
out of even the. sacred fringes oÂ£ the
grove, of course we went yesterday!
And, by the way, we were not the first
ladies to attend a Bohemian jinks â by
invitation. Mr. Hotaling, the reader of
the afternoon, made an astounding con
fession. For the first time the eternal
feminine this year, after thirty years of
exclusion, took part in the jinksl True,
they â there were two of them â were
but tiny things, the daughter of the
wood keeper and her playmateâ but
still ladies. And not Mr. Hotaling's
most Brutus-like eloquence met with
the applause this statement him!
Nine-tenths of the , audience were
women, however, and, very charming,
I set out to say, the house looked there
fore. There is no theater in, town that
"dresses up" more , prettily than the
Tivoli. . . (\ -Â¦
The programme of the. afternoon con
sisted of. the club. music dramas of the
last three . years, beginning j with / Dr.
H. J. Stewart's "Montezuma," followed
by W. H. McCoy's "The Hamadryads,",
of this year, and J. D. Redding^ "The
Man in the Forest," 1902. In each case
the comDositions were preluded by . a
reading of the story and a slight ex
position of its musical treatment; by
Richard Hotaling, to whom both com
posers and audience owe much. A
good many actors might usefully go to
school to Mr. Hotaling, who uses a
resonant and ; melodious voice with ad
mirable intelligence and clearness. ,'
By â¢ much the most important work
on the programme was "The Hama
dryads" of W. J. McCoy.
The "public jinks" of the Bohemian
Club, given yesterday afternoon at the
Tivoli, justified itself from every stand
pointâsocial, financial and artistic. The
affair was the first of its kind. Until
yesterday the baby Bayreuth up in the
redwoods had hung on to its music
dramas as jealously as Mamma Wag
ner to "Parsifal." Last year a stray
strain or so â from Dr. . Stewart's
"Montezuma" â floated into heretic ears
by way of Scheel's symphony concerts,
but until then and since the silence has
been absolute. But that was the
wedge's thin end. The public asked for
more. Yesterday's concert was the re
sult. Where the innovations will end
it is impossible to foresee. Possibly
in yearly public pilgrimages to Bohe
mian Grove. However, an annual jinks
of yesterday's kind seems a foregone
conclusion.
In the "Supplication," a solo -for
barytone and chorus, the lack of re
hearsal was felt. Neither is it by any
means either so, interesting or original
as the â¢"Prelude" and "Dance." Judge
H. A.. Melvin contributed - a ner
vous butj melodious barytone Â¦ in the
solo, and a chorus of forty, consisting
mostly of Bohemians, furnished a com
petent choral accompaniment. "The
Coming' of Apollo," the Â«concluding
movement, is a vigorous and dashing
number, with, however, one extra
ordinarily banal theme, whose banality
is the more unpleasant from its fre
quency. As a whole, though, the work
is of quite exceptional value and was
conducted with a firm and magnetic
baton by its composer.
Dr." Stewart's "Montezuma" came
first on the programme, and pleased, as
on its hearing last year, with its un
pretentious, charm. The march should
find a| welcome on any orchestral pro
gramme, and the finale in particular
has . the picturesque and' dramatla
value. Dr. Stewart conducted and was
heartily ' welcomed.
Evidently it would not much have
mattered what Mr. Redding did. The
cries for "Joe," as the popular clubman
walked on the stage to lead his "Man
in the Forest," testified warmly to his
unimpingable popularity. "The Man in
the Forest" is not overwhelmingly Im
portant, be : it confessed. There are
charming little descriptive passages,
quaint bits : of tone color, some few
dainty themes in ..the work,- btit as a
whole the composition lacks in coher
ence,, in. cumulative grasp, in definite
character. It ehould be said that It
was the first of the' music dramas to be
written for the grove, and is evidently
altogether less ambitious in intention
than its 'successors. ,* Next time, ; Mr.
Redding.' Mr. Hotaling|s reading of the
"legend" here was one of the pleasant
est features of ,the afternoon. His
speech preceding it,- in whtch he hoped
we might come again, % was another.

McCARTHY GETS DAMAGES-^The Su
preme Court has allowed John McCarthy of
Nevada County 150 damages against the Gas
ton Ridce Mill and Mining Company because
the corporation let mine refuse Into the plain
tiffs Irrigating: ditch. The company is di
rected not to pollute McCarthy's stream in tha
future.'
The unpaid sums are included in
the clauses of a contract made on
February 9 of last year whereby
Coerper transferred to Wilson $2,720,-
C00 worth of the corporate stock of
the Kona and Kaui Railway Company,
Limited, of the Island of Hawaii, and
all of his interest in the Kona Sugar
Company.' The transfer of, these in
terests was for the purpose of finan
cially rehabilitating the companies
named. It is said that a new lifie
was about to be laid for the railroad,
but the company was embarrassed.
It is set forth in the complaint that
Wilson agreed to put the company in
proper shape and as soon as he was
able to float the prospective bonds he
wculd pay Coerper 5320,000 and the
additional sums mentioned in the suit.
If he did not succeed in four years
in negotiating the bonds the prom
ised payments were still to be made.
Wilson defaulted in the first payments,
hence the -suit .â¢ - ; .>
An effort to float the new construc

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 1.'â The play
ing of the San Franciscos to-day was
nothing like the exhibition they put
up yesterday. Knell Was given a se
vere beating and the team-behind him
played loosely at times. The locals
played a great game on bases and the
result was a second victory for the
Angels by the score of 9 to 3. Score:
Knell Has Nothing With Which to
Puzzle Southern Hatsmen.
ANOTHER GAME FOR ANGELS.
The small attendance at the park be
gan to make a getaway ere the game
was half concluded. Every one was
disgusted, with the possible exception
of "Skel" Roach. He thought he was
doing a great stunt, and he was after
the first inning. The Commuters never
scored again and "Skel" had them all
swinging their heads off at his elusive
offerings.
The only good thing in the game was
the fielding of Beck at third. He
scooped up three that were absolutely
the hottest things that ever sped in
the direction of third base. Catcher
Stark made' his first, appearance here
with Oakland.. The Brownies stole all
kinds of bases on him. The score:

No one, on the Oakland team could

with a bad throw and a fumble in the
field. Then Schlafley's turn came and
so did Francos'. The former rolled up
three errors and the latter two. and
each was good for a run.
; If it was a race "to see which team
could pile up the miscues the fastest,
the Commuters .would have slipped to
the, front with the glory alb theirs yes
terday, at Recreation Park, but it was
runs that counted and it was' here the
Commuters were to the bad. After
starting with a lead of three, they
went; to pieces and the Brownies had
all the runs they needed in two In
nings. Score: Oakland 3, Portland 10.

STANDING OF THE CLUIJS
The discus throw attracted little at
â¢ tentlon until the announreis called the
result of M. J. Sheridan's first throw.
It came within a few inches of equal
ing the world's record, made by him
self, of 127 feet 3'i inches. When Sher
. idan again stepped into the seven-foot
ring the crowd awaited, almost breath
lessly, while the steel discus whirled
through the air. The measurer raced to
the ppot where the 1 -discus had buried
Itself, 130 feet $ inches from the start
ing point. The result of the next thrcrw
â¢wÂ»s 1"2 feet. The discus used by Sher
idan was weighed and found to be one
eighth of an ounce overweight.
The enthusiasm of the crowd was
renewed a short time later when Myer
â¢ Prinstein of the Greater New York
Athletic Association added 6^ inches
to -the Olympic running broad jump
record established by A. C. Kraenzlein
pf the University of Pennsylvania at
the Paris games in 1900. Kraenzlein.
who was also the -Olympic champion
in th$ 200-meter hurdle, was deposed
by H. W. Hillman of the New York
Athletic Club. Hillman got away in
front and. although headed in the
'early part of the race, regained the
lead and crossed the tape in the record
time of 24 3-5 seconds.
ST, LOUIS. Sept. 1.â In the Olympic
frames to-day one world's record and
three Olympic records were broken.
One of the greatest races of the 1904
Olympiad was the SOO-meter run (W4.89
â¢yards). Not only did James D. Light
body of the. Chicago Athletic Associa
tion lower the Olympic record by 5 2-5
seconds, but he ran the leps off the
German representative, who collapsed
at the finish.

A forceful and brilliant impersona
tion of Napoleon was given last night
by Arnold Daly in Shaw's comedy,
"The Man of Destiny," presented as
a double bill with "Candida" at the
Columbia. Miss Donnelly, who has
the part of the beguiling: "Lady" in
the play, is a delightful second to Mr.
Daly. Miss Donnelly develops a wit,
archness and spirit in the character
that are Indeed only hinted at in her
Candida. The little drama runs for
an hour and thirteen minutes and in
them Shaw and Mr. Daly combine to
give a dazzling, vital, intimate little
picture of "The Man of Destiny." The
scene is played almost entirely be
tween the two .. chief characters, and
the interest is white-hot almost
throughout. There was much ap
plause, particularly for Napoleon's
anti-pro English speech. This double
bill will be given up to and including
Sunday night. .

Electric Road to Lick Observatory.
SAN JOSE. Sept. 1. â An enthusias
tic meeting of business men at the
Chamber of Commerce this evening
decided to push the project of an
electric railroad up Mount Hamilton
to the Lick Observatory. All present
were in favor of the road. A large
sum of money was raised at the meet
ing to begin the work of surveys and
looking into rights of way for the
road.
A concert by \the club's military
band of twenty-four pieces opened the
show. The music was heartily en
cored after rendering several selec
tions.
George Schlitter and three of his
pupils went through a swinging club
act with torchlights.which was novel
and brilliant. A one-act sketch en
titled "Si Perkins Looking for a Farm
Boy" kept the audience in laughter
throughout. A double trio of boy
voices sang two selections in a pleas
ing manner. Several other acts
brought praise to the young perform
ers.
The juvenile members of the Co
lumbia Park Boys' Club gave a clever
vaudeville entertainment last night at
Native Sons' Hall, which was attended
by a large audience.
The show was unusually good and
credit is due to Sidney S. Piexotto for
the way he drilled the youngsters in
their various acts. The boys ranged
from 8 to 15 years in age, but they
handled their parts like experienced
artists.

eased beans were sent to K. E. Smith,
professer of plant pathology at the
University of California, and he re

Dr. Keast dwelt principally on the
suppression of the vice and why it was
not done. He held that the matter was
wholly in the hands of the Police De
partment. Part of the failure to sup
press this and all lawlessness lay at
the doors of the police courts. The po
lice officers themselves complain that
often they cannot get convictions even
where the guilt of the accused is ap
parent.
Dr. Keast holds that the saloon is not
directly responsible for the existence
and circulation of obscene literature,
but the evil springs from social im
morality and impurity. Obscenity is a
feeder of these conditions. It corrupts
the mind and when that is corrupt the
stronghold on character is destroy-ed.

The army transport Thomas, Captain Lyraan
In command, sailed yesterday for the Philip
pines. In addition to her passengers and a
'.arjre cargo of military supplies she carried
M.OOO.OW of the new Filipino silver coinage.
She left the transport wharf promptly at noon.
She carried 127 cavalry recruits, 175 in
far.try recruits, casuals, hospital corps men,
signal corps men and five jackies for Guam.
The Shenandoah was off Cape Horn
in company with the Homeward Bound,
which arrived here August 19 and made
the run from Antwerp in 127 days.
Head winds retarded the Shenandoah's
progress and considering the weather
Captain Chapman is well satisfied with
the time made by his vessel.
Â»
rransport Thomas Sails.
Science, however, seems to haw
solved the problem of coal transporta
tion in sailing ships. Before starting
on the passage just ended the Shcn
andoah was equipped with apparatus
by means of which not on!y close
watch can be kept on the cargo's tem
perature, but the air in the holds can
be cooled. In the event of fire chem
ical gases can be forced to the seat
of troublÂ« and the flames extinguished
without the necessity of removing the
hatches. Eleven time's during the
Shenandoah's trip from Baltimore did
Captain Chapman draw out ihe heat
ed air of the holds and replace it from
the cool breezes that were blowing the
ciipper to her destination. Captain
Chapman is delighted with the new
contrivance and says that he would
not be afraid to sail the Shenandoah
for another 150 days with her present
cargo still in her.
, The American ship Shenandoah.
handsomest of Yankee clippers, ar
rived yesterday. 150 days from Balri-^
more, with 4300 tons of$Â»al. The Shftii
andoah made a long passage, but
brought her cargo of coal to port cool
and in good condition. Baltimore coal
in the past has been a eangerous carpi
for a wooden ship and more than or*C3
only th? bravery of the Shenar.doah's
oncers and crew has saved her from
the flames generated by spontaneous
combustion.

The Chicago wires of E. F. Huttoo * Co. yes

sure, probably dne to tfce fact that September
liquidation is pretty well over. There tu
some foreign buying of Lartl and some
baying by local traders and scalpers. We
cannot see any accumulation of tons stuff
going on in good places. Xaturally the selling
pressure will be somewhat less, *a the Sep
tember staff is cleaned up and a moderate re
action would seem likely. Before advising
purchases, however, we would . rather seÂ« a
better class of baying."

Butter", Cheese and Eggs.
Th^re was no further advance in Butter and
the demand was reported rather slower. Stocks
were not excessive, but additional supplies
from the north will be on the market to-day
or to- morrow, which Inclines the large buyers
to hold off.
The feeling in Cheese Is decidedly weak and
tr<* demand is slow, while stocks are too Â»Â«â¢Â»â¢â¢'?.
The demand fcr ranch Eggs was much lignt_ r
yesterday, as the recent advance has en-, k-a
the retail consumption and shifted the public
off to Eastern and | cold storage goods. - which
they are now generally using. Dealers report
an active business in both these latter de
scriptions at steady prices and say that fresh
ranch are dragging. This statement is general
all over the street. Eastern ar# coming in
every day and quite a number of cars are ex

is no scarcity.

steady demand fcr local use and shipping ac
count. Fresh arrivals of strictly fancy Apples
cleaned up promptly and some dealers were
expecting an advance. Peachca were firmer
under light arrivals from all sections, and
fancy frcit frcm the mountain districts readily
commanded a premium. Pears. Plums aad
Prunes were steady at about previous prices.
Melons had the advantage of the warm, sunny
weather and moved off .-freely at good figures.
Table Grapes continued to arrive freely
and. although trade was brisk. there
was quite a surplus unsold at the close.
Several carloads of Zinfandet WinÂ© Grapes
were received from Fresno and Martinez, but
there was no market for them, as local wine
makers have not yet^ commenced to buy. For
Fretno lots SlofilT per ton was asked, but
buyers were not willing to pay over $12 and
dealers refused, to }Â»art with their holdings at
those figures. Antloch offerings were held at
$lÂ«Â©20 per ton. but no sales were reported

GEORGE 3IOWRY IS FIXED
$100 BY SUPREME COURT
Executor of Simon Straus Estate Re
ceives Punishment for Clogging Â¦
Wheels of Justice.
George B. Mowry was fined $100 by
the Supreme Court yesterday for mak
ing what is characterized as a "frivo
lous" a*ppeal. It is also stated that an
action for damages should be institut
ed aeainst him. â
v Mowrj% was appointed . executor of
the estate of Simon Straus in 1895.
He managed decedent's hide and tal
iow business successfully, but when
he was requested to make a partial
distribution amounting* to $2000 he
refused and fought the case in court.
The Judge ordered him to pay over
$1500, and he appealed to the Su
preme Court. The last named tri
bunal says that Mowry simply desires
to postpone the final settlement
through . protracted litigation and
that he had no reason whatever for
not agreeing to the oartlal distribu
tion desired.
The fines imposed by the Supreme
Court for frivolous appeals are few
and this method. of punishment is re
sorted to only in. very flagrant cases.

Slow progress is being made in Judge
Dunne's court in securing 'a jury to try
the case of Frederick Tobelmann,
charged with the murder of his wife,
Mary, on April 1. Out of 330 names
drawn from the jury box only six have
as ret been accepted. A venire of 150
was ordered yesterday, returnable next
Wednesday.
The jury in the case of Alexander B.
Garn<=tt. charged with the murder o*f
Major J. W. McClung In the rooms of
Mrs. Elizabeth W. Coit on November
25, after being out twentv-one hours,
brought in a verdict yesterday after
noon of murder in the second degree,
with a recommendation of mercy. The
defendant listened to the verdict apa
thetically. He was ordered to appear
for sentence on September 13, when his
attorney. George D. Collins, will make
a motion for a new trial. The penalty
is from ten years to life imprisonment.
The case has been remarkable for the
numerous, continuances granted the de
fendant on various pretexts and be- j
cause of an evident desire in certain
quarters not to prosecute. At the
preliminary hearing before Police)
Judge Fritz on December 6 and j
7 the defendant was represented j
by Attorney W. H. Alford. After
Garnett was held to answer At- !
torney W. -D. Grady appeared and j
adopted the policy of delay. He was!
successful till the Judge lost patience
and Attorney Collins stepped in to rep- j
resent the defendant. The conviction i
is considered remarkable, considering
the absence of Mrs. Coit and the great
pull for the defendant.

day morning in the case of George T.

SLATER OF MAJOR J. "W. Mc-
CLl'NG. WHO HAS BEEN CON
VICTED OF MURDER,
Judge Morrow held that the require
ment respecting such deposit was a
regulation in excess of the authority of
the secretary. The regulation in ques
tion provided that no alien desiring ad
mission at a port of the United States
for the professed purpose of proceeding
directly therefrom to. foreign territory
ehall be permitted to. land thereat ex
cept after deposit with 'the Collector
cf Customs at said port by the master
or owner of the vessel on which such
alien is brought of the amount of the
h,ead tax. $2. prescribed by section Â¦ 1
of the act approved March 3. 1903. said
amount to be refunded upon proof sat
isfactory to- the. immigration cfflcer|in
charge at the port of arrival that said
alien has passed by direct . and con
tinuous journey through and out of the
United State?. The immigration act
itself expressly provides that the head
tax therein mentioned shall not be
levied upon aliens in transit in the
United States. The court said that the
-Immigration Commissioner had no
power to require, the deposit of the $2,
and had further no power to require
that such aliens shall pass "by direct
and continuous journey through and
out of the United States."
The case was handled on behalf of
the steamship companj- by Frank &
Mansfield.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
rendered an oral decision yesterday in
favor of the complainant In the suit
of the Oceanic Steamship Company
vertus Frederick S. Stratton as Collec
tor of the Port. The action was
brought to recover $420 deposits ex
torted'from the steamship company by
a regulation of the Department of Com
merce and Labor providing that a de
pesit of $2 per head should be made
by thÂ» company for each alien passen
eer in transit through the United
States.
R. D. Faulkner, principal of the new

"The total enrollment of this school
since its. organization, July 27, to date
is forty-five, all boys. This number is
now in .daily attendance.. There, .has
been but little truancy and no boy has
been truant to exceed one day. On
Monday I divided the boys into , two
classes, putting a substitute in charge
o-f one class in compliance with orders
previously received from you. As only
one teacher has been assigned to the
school I would recommend- that anoth
er be assigned to begin work after the
vacation, Monday, September 12." . ,
Langdon also reported that the new
course of study has been put into oper
ation throughout the. department and
its efficiency may be already deter
mined to a slight degree although not
so thoroughly as will be revealed by a
year's test.

nie E. 'O'Sullivan, Noe Valley,, new

The soint in the trial here was
the question of his sobriety at the time
of the rumpus which caused his arrest.
The leading witnesses testified that he
was either drunk or crazy, but as none
of them had actually seen him take
an intoxicating drink they could not
say what was the cause of his maudlin
condition or his violent and unseemly
conduct.' He therefore escapes with a
reprimand.
For a few months he apparently be
haved himself, but on his arrival here
last spring on his way to Manila, he
entered into a round â¢ of festivities
which culminated in a sensational
brawl which landed him in the Police
Court, where he was fined $10 by Judge
Mogan on a charge of disturbing the
peace. He left the day after the dis
turbance for Manila, but General Mac-
Arthur, hearing of the scandalous es
capade, cabled to Honolulu to have
him taken from the transport on which
he was a passenger, and sent back here
for trial.-
Captain Frank A. Cook, U. S. A., is
a very lucky man. He will retain his
commission in the army notwithstand
ing the midnight brawl 'in which he
was the principal actor some months
ago in a prominent resort on the corner
of O'Farrell street and Grant avenue. .
He owes the retention of his shoulder
straps to the fact that in all the
evidence introduced at the court
martial, there was nothing elicited to
show that any of the witnesses had
seen him Imbibe an intoxicant.
As it stands now he escapes . from
being dismissed from the army, but at
the same time receives a severe repri
mand from General MacArthur and
the court of high officers in the army
who sat upon the board which tried
him. He was tried last year before
a court-martial for. conduct unbecom
ing an officer and a gentleman and
barely escaped being dismissed from
the army. Upon his assurance that he
would abstain from the use of intoxi
cants, supplemented* by his signing a
pledge to the effect that for three years
he would refrain from using stimu
lants, he was permitted to retain his
commission.
