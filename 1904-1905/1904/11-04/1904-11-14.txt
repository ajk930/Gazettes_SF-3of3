The main questions that will come
â¢np, according, to the president, are the
oft-repeated discussions of trade juris
diction and affiliation of labor bodies.
In â¢ the opinion of President Gompers
the time. is not yet ripe for the gather-
Ing of. foreign labor bodies into an in
ternational federation, with the possi
ble .exception of a combination of the
longshoremen of the world. â¢ :>
President Gompers left Washington
last Sunday and stepped over in Indi
anapolis .and Chicago for conferences
with- labor leaders. On the long jour
ney i to * the ' coast' the executive . council

oftenlasting all'day. During this time
the secretary, and treasurer formulated
their; reports to - the convention, as did
also ; Mr/" Gompers. These reports will
be" presented at the session to-day.
believe that this federation will be
'committed to any political party,
whatever its name, whatever its claim
or whatever its pretense. The only
saf e ; course for . organized labor to
adopt Is one of absolute non-committal
to 'any political party. There may be
five or six delegates with socialistic
leanings, but any resolution looking to
ward the adoption of socialistic tenets
will, : I am sure, meet with the disap
proval ! of an overwhelming majority."
LONG CREEK. Ore.. Nov. 13. â The
first suspect of the organized gang of
stock thieves which has operated In
Northern Grant County for several
years has been found, and a dozen
armed men have surrounded the camp
in which the other members of the
band are believed to have hidden.
"Jim" Male Is the man arrested by
Deputy Sheriff Coffey. The posse came
upon him while he was sleeping in a
cabin in the mountains several miles
from here. The deputy and his posse
feel confident that once the gang: in
the mountain camp is captured, cattle

battle between cattle thieves and offi
cers near Deeth. Nev.. to-day. ,
Sheriff Clark -and a deputy of Elko
caught Jim McKelvey and Charier?
Winslow in the act of skinning a steer of
the Graham brand. When called upon
to surrender they dropped behind the
carcass of the animal and began firing
at the officers. The latter sought shel
ter and for twenty minutes the firing
continued.
Finally McKelvey sprang to his feet
and fired. The shot was returned and
McKelvey fell dead. A few minutes
later "Winslow surrendered and was
found to be mortally wounded. He was
placed In jail at Elko.
Elko County has been troubled with
cattle thieves for some time, and the
officers have been on the lookout for
them. McKelvey was well known
throughout the county.
In regard to the withdrawal of the
charter <rom the Chicago Federation of
Labor/thus depriving it of affiliation
with the American Federation, , Presi
dent Gompers said that such action
had been taken . before the council left
Chicago.' As' to the seating of Delegate
William G. Schardt of 'the Chicago
body, Mr. Gompers said that . the com
mittee on credentials would report on
the case.' .

Although declining to discuss the* ru
mored change of officers. President
Gompers, when interviewed â¢ yesterday
afternoon, said that he could not fore

time. -The sessions will be open to the
public and, the resolutions Â¦â¢ introduced

and William J. Spencer.
Little of federation politics was dis
cussed- last night at the headquarters
and the, leaders refused to predict any
definite convention action. There is an
anti-Gompers sentiment in evidence,
however, among. several of the dele
gates and the rumor was around that
Gompers may be retired from the'pres-
Jdency and that James Duncan of New
York elected to succeed him.
Another rumor is that Gompers is to
be appointed United States Labor
Commissioner to succeed Carroll . D.
Wright. President Gompers declined
to make any predictions, regarding the
work of 1 the? convention, as did , also
Vice President Duncan, his possible
successor. Duncan*has been mentioned
as a candidate for several years, but he
has never made the race, and this fact,

BALTIMORE, Nov. 13. â A snow,
wind and rain storm which developed
here early this morning'and continued
through the day and night. caused an
almost complete wreckage of the elec
tric light, telegraph, telephone and
trolley service. A number, of acci-
Wind, Rain and Snow Almost Isolate
the City.
A careful watch has been maintained
in the hope of rescuing any sailors that
might be swept ashore. According to
Carson it would mean certain death
for the men to attempt to reach the
shore in a small boat.
At 9 o'clock to-night it -was feared
that all on board had perished. The
seas were breaking over the craft and
it was not believed that she would bold
together until daylight. She struck in
a particularly exposed position, and no
vessel could be expected to stand thÂ»
terrible pounding on the jagged rocks
to which she was subjected.
The nearest life-saving station on the
north side of Vineyard Sound is at
Cuttyhunk, twenty miles from Tar
paulin Cove. On the south side of the
sound there is a life-saving station at
Gayh^ad. but that is too far away to
have been of any service in to-day's
disaster. Keeper Carson had no boat
that could be launched, and, besides,
the seas were so high that nothing 1 but
a surf boat could escape almost instant
destruction. No lights were shown
from the schooner after she struck and
no answer was given to the frequent
hailings of Carson and Robinson.
WOODS HOLE, N. S., Nov. 13.â The
two-masted schooner Earcularius, Cap
tain Nason, of Rockland. Maine, went
ashore in a severe northeast gale short
ly before dark to-night, about three
quarters of a mile west of Tarpaulin
Cove, on the Island of Naushen. At
sunset the seas were breaking over the
craft. No trace of the crew has been
found. The vessel is in a particularly
exposed condition and the "chance" 6t
her being saved Is slight. â¢
Keeper Carson of the Tarpaulin Cove
lighthouse and a man named Robert
eon, one o-f the keepers of the Forbes
estate, saw the schooner when " she
struck. It was Just before dark- and a
terrific gale was blowing. The schooner
was coming through Vineyard Sound
from the eastward and was proceeding
under her foresail, the gale being too
fierce to permit more canvas being car
ried. The schooner tacked and tried to
work into the cove for anchorage, but
the wind bore her off, and as^ she
swung away she struck with a crash
upon a ledge of rock not more than 100
yards from the lighthouse.
Carson and Robinson were unable to
render any assistance to the men on
board. The crew numbered four men
and all were plainly seen when the ves
sel struck, but darkness set in almost
immediately and nothing more was
seen of them.

NEW YORK. Nov. 13.â New York is
entirely cut off from the South and
West to-nifht bv a fierce hurricane,
accompanied by rain and snow, which
is sweeping the Atlantic Coast. Start-
Ing from Florida last r.ight. the storm
of -wind and rain has come up the coast
with almost cyclonic speed.
Rain began falling in New York at
5 a. m., and early in the morning
changed to wet enow. The wind, which
had been blowing moderately, veered
to the southeast, and shortly assumed
hurricane proportions. At 6 o'clock to
night the local Weather Bureau noted
a velocity of forty-two miles an hour,
"which increased to forty-eight at 8:30
o'clock. That ppeed kept up for several
hours. At 10 o'clock the storm center

barometer was a trifle hishtr. and the
wind sixty miles.
Wire service out of New York is tied
up more effectively to-night than at
try other time since thp blizzard of
X&8S. The Western Union and tele
graph companies have no direct com
munication tvjth cities farther south
than Baltimore, and all Western points

can communicate with the territories

to-night to make repairs so that busi

roads running out of Jersey City and

extent of the damage. The long-dis

badly handicapped in its service.
The Weather Bureau yesterday sent
out warnings advising sea captains to
remain in port over Sunday.
Some damage was done in and around
New York. Te-night the ferryboat
Port Morris, running between College
Point and Ninety-sixth 6treet, went
athcre on a rocky ledge in Bowery
Bay. There were ten passengers and
the crew aboard. Owing to the heavy
Eea it is impossible to eend wrecking
boats to her, but a police boat has gone
to the rescue.
Owing to the fierce downpour the
streets of New York were practically
deserted to-day. The high wind
played havoc with the street signs,
Â¦which fell in showers. Many windows
were broken and a few passers-by
were cut by the signs and flying glass.
DAMAGE IN* THE HARBOR.
The full force of the gale was felt
in the harbor. Several boats, anchored
off Staten Island dragged their
anchors. Late in the evening a freight
barge, apparently unloaded, was
blown ashore during the height of the
gcle in Sandy Hook Bay. The vessel
lies in a very bad position, with every
isea sweeping: her decks. The life

At Bellevue iii...-;>ita! the storm was
felt- -severely. One of- the large elms
standir*g on the. campus was blown
down and half a dozen men narrowly
escaped being crushed. Later on a
tent occupied by eighteen tuberculosis
patients was wrecked by the wind and
the suffering people were exposed to
the elements. They were removed ,to
the hospital as soon as possible, al
though most of them were drenched
to the skin.
At midnight the 'oral weather bu
reau said 1.48 inches of rain and melt
ed snow had fallen. It was predicted
that the storm would be 'centered off
the provinces 'to-morrow, thence pass-,
ing out to sea. â¢
"Now, so far as , the overcoat is con

came to me and stayed at. my home all

I loaned him my overcoat. There was
no pistol in my. overcoat, and this pistol
story has no connection with the coat.

It Is reported that Adolph made a
statement to-day to the effect that rob
bery was the motive for the murder of
his family. He could not imagine any
other motive, it Is said he remarked.
Adrian Wills, whose name figured
conspicuously at the inquest last night
in connection with the coon hunt, the
overcoat and the pistol, said to-day:
"I am placed before the public in a
very unenviable position. Adolph and I
were friends In early boyhood, but
about four years ago we drifted apart.
He suddenly became inclined to follow
solitary mirsuits and gave up his time
to reading and a study of the occult.
He read all kinds of books, both good
and bad. He only -read the bad books
to make him understand and appreciate
the good in the good books. In fact, we
had entirely drifted apart until the coon
hunt. Then one of the boys invited
Adolph to go on the hunt. Adolph came.
Previously to this time Adolph had
been apparently full of vigor and life
and was inclined .to athletic sports.. He
had been a baseball player,. and a good
one. On the coon hunt he suddenly de
veloped signs of weakness, and gave

. To-morrow at 9 a. m. Attorney Tabor
will appear before Judge E.*O. Smith
and demand an immediate hearing for
his client. How soon this hearing will
be held rests with District Attorney
Robinson.
His attorney, Ben Tabor, assisted by
S. J. Pullen, made an attempt this
morning to get him released on a writ
of habeas corpus, as they had ascer
tained that the original complaint was
not legal. The Sheriff was quickly on
the s^ot and filed an amended com
plaint charging young Adolph Weber
with the murder of his father. Other
complaints were also drawn up charg
ing him with the murder of his
mother, sister and brother. . ' V-~ ; v
COMPLAINTS AMENDED.
Young Adolph still maintains a
stolhi indifference to everybody and
everything. When he was informed
by Jailer Fulton this morning that
the remains of his father, mother, sis
ter and brother had been sent to San
Francisco he said nothing, and when
asked if he did not want to go to the
funeral in San Francisco he turned
away and made no reply. Suddenly
he looked up and asked the jailer to
send him the San Francisco papers as
soon as they arrived. When the pa
pers came he read them all carefully
and thoroughly and commented upon
the different statements. He was satis
fled with some of the statements and
greatly pleased with many of the
others.
AUBURN, Nov. 13. â The sole topic
of conversation here to-day was the
Weber tragedy. In .every hotel and
place of public meeting the one ques
tion has been: Who committed the
deed and what was the motive? Be
ing Sunday, many, people from the
surrounding country came into town
and nearly all of" them went up to the
hill to view the ruins of the once
beautiful home jofithe Weber family.
At 7 o'clock this morning: the re
mains of the four victims of the awful
tragedy were placed, on the -.train and
taken to San Francisco. A large num
ber of sorrowing friends gathered at
the station to pay mute respect to
those ,who had been so suddenly cast
into eternity. The son, Adolph, was
not there. When the train slowly
pulled out of the station every, man
stood uncovered and every woman
bowed her head. They were all bid
ding a sad farewell to friends they
loved.

In short, the Democratic party has this
hopeless situation: The Bryanltes cannot drive
out th- plutocratic element; the plutocratic
element cannot drive out Mr. Bryan. They
exhaust their strength with internal strug
gles, leaving the party where its enemies
can always defeat It at the polls. There Is
this further weakness in the programme of
Mr. Bryan: Tha plutocratic element has
shown that it can safely defy him and com
bat him; although ha Is the nominee, whereas
Aa submits to them whan toey put up a plu
tocratic nominee. From a party so hopelessly
divided it is the rankest foUy, In my opin
ion, to exoeot any reforms. From year to
year It is & dreary go round and round of one
faction fighting another faction, each of which
alternately whips the other and neither of
which ever whips the enemy.

a purpoeeiwhich is common to us ail. but I
believe that the best way to assure, the final
sucoosa of the reform movement is for us to
build up a party of Jeffersoolan Democracy
on solid foundations, where unity of senti
ment roes hand in hand with unity of pur
pose and where, therefore, some hope, of ao
compllPhlng that which we wish to accom
plish can be reasonably entertained.
In the South there are peculiar reasons why
the present policy of the Democratic leaders
should be defeated and a better Una of policy
adopted. For the last \rtrenty-nve or thirty
years tha Democratic machine politicians have
made that great section a mare tool in tha
hands of Wail street and a handful of East
ern Democrats who hava no purpose- In com
mon with us and who usa the electoral vote
of tha Solid South for their own selfish pur
poses. In this manner our Southern country,
which is an empire in itself, has been made
a province for a few great financial magnates,
who exploit it for their private gain without
the slightest reference to tha welfare of tha
Southern people. The situation is pitiable,
Tha degradation of it finds expression In the
phrase : "The Solid South would vote for a
yellow dog on tha Democratic ticket."
DEPLORES SOOTH'S SERVITUDE.
As a Southern man I am ashamed of such a
state of affairs, and resent It profoundly. If I
can do anything* toward aocomplishlng the po
litical Independence of my own people from
this slavish servitude to a handful of Wall
street politicians I consider It a duty to do so.
If the People's party had no other mission
than to relax the grasp. which the great rail
way corpora tjpnÂ» have upon the commercial
throat of the Southern States, a grasp which
Is maintained by the alliance between Demo
cratic- bosses and Wall street financial kings,
then It would have a sufficient mission to war
rant its continued existence. My own State, of
Georgia is as completely under the thumb of
Morgan â¢ and Belmont. one of whom controls
the Southern Railway combine, the other of
whjjm controls the Louisville and Nashville
combine, as the State of Pennsylvania is under
the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad or
the State of Wisconsin is under the control of
those corporations which La Follette has won
national fame in , combating. The situation
is simply appalling- and would not be believed
by anybody who was not conversant with the
facts.
I expect to return home and open a cam
paign on the lines of Jefferson Ian Democracy,
to take our State government out of the con
trol of ' Morgan and Belmont and to put Â¦ It
Into tha control of . the Georgia people, where
It belongs. In , nearly every Southern State
there la a similar contest to be waged against
corporation tyranny. v * . '

tragedy to-day at Point Reyes station.
But for the steel in the corset of a

hands of the editor would have pierced
her heart.
While returning from a huntinsr triD
near Inverness, Cochrane. in order to
reach San Rafael by rail drove to Point
Reyes station to catch the south bound
train. He arrived ahead of time and
sauntered around the station to kill
time.
While conversing with the telegraph
operator he spied a rfle in the corner
of the station and picked It up to
examine It. The gun proved to be a
new automatic one of small caliber.
Suddenly the weapon was discharged.
The bullet went through the station
house window and, struck a younsr it'lrl
who was conversing with a friend out
side, in the body. Luckily the bullet
was small and struck a steel In the
young girl's corset, otherwise a fatal
wound might have been Inflicted.
The young woman was somewhat
frightened, but when she learned the
course the bullet had taken, smiled
and thought herself a lucky girl.

CHICAGO, Nov. 13.; â Encouraged
by the large vote polled In the recent
election the Socialist party has deter

to seek recruits from the ranks of the
Republican and Democratic parties.
As soon as the spellbinders have re

In order to raise sufficient funds to
carry on the campaign of education
those who voted the ticket this year
and also' new converts will be asked
to pay 10 cents a month in dues.
When the campaign of 1908 opens the
party leaders hope to have $1,000,000
with which to make the fight.
With the big fund hoped for. the
Socialists say, they will not be ham

LOGANSPORT. Ind.. Nov. 13. â
Congressman Frederick Landis. who
has just been re-elected by an over
whelming majority, has .developed
symptoms of lockjaw. He made a
vigorous campaign for weeks before
the election, delivering sixty speeches
in less than a month, many in open

LOCKJAW RESULTS FROM
CAMPAIGN SPEAKINO
Broad and Liberal Movement Gains
Momentum Daily.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 13.â Russia
is facing a great internal crisis, which
in the minds of intelligent Russians
overshadows in importance all ques
tions relating to foreign politics. A new
broad and liberal movement seems not
only under way, but is gaining mo
mentum dally, and the best feature of
it is that it is entirely divorced from
any radical revolutionary propaganda.
Prince Sviatopolk Mirsky, the Minister
of the Interior, has given the movement
impetus, but has done so against the
most powerful influences, and behind
the scenes a bitter struggle is waging
for imperial support. During the com
ing week the first test of strength is
likery to occur, the result of which may
mean much for the history of Russia-
The policy of reaction, which had
grown steadily since the accession of
Alexander III, seemed suddenly to lose
Its main bulwark when Minister
Plehwe felL With the advent of Prince
Sviatopolk Mirsky and his frank appeal
for a policy of mutual confidence be
tween Government and people a tre
mendous liberal rebound occurred, rais
ing, perhaps unjustifiably, high hopes
and aspirations.
An American enjoying absolute polit
ical freedom can hardly appreciate the
full significance of the changes that
have occurred since Prince Sviatopolk
Mirsky's Inauguration in a land of ab
solutism. The Russian policy as re
gards Finland, if not reversed, has been
greatly ameliorated, and the Finnish
national Diet will meet next month.
Only yesterday prominent FInlanders
who were exiled under the Plehwe
regime received permission to return to
their own country or to go abroad if
they desired to do so.
The oppressive activity of the police
throughout the empire has been
largely relaxed; banishment by ad
ministrative order has been abolished;
hundreds of political prisoners exiled
to Siberia have been recalled; the
Jews have received assurances of the
dawning of a brighter day; the doors
have been thrown open at two of the
biggest trials proceeding In Russia
(the Schaumann treason trial and the
Jewish trial at Gobel) .. and the
method of treating student demonstra
tions has been radically changed. Per*
suasion is being substituted for Cos
sack charges.
But nowhere are the changes so
marked as in the matter of the press.
After years of the strictest censorship
Russian papers suddenly found their
voices within the last fortnight and
were remarkably plain spoken | in the
discussion off Internal affairs, and es
pecially now the forthcoming meeting
of Zemstvo presidents. All accounts
of the Schaumann and Gobel trials
have been printed and even particu
lars of student demonstrations, with
resolutions offered at the polytechnic
institute declaring that what was
wanted was not confidence, but an
end of the war and the immediate
convocation of a national assembly.
Such an unprecedented publication
made the Russian public rub Its eyes
in amazement.
Prince Ouktomsky, editor of the
Viodomostl. said to-day that never
within his memory liad Russian news
papers been allowed such liberties;
yet these things had been done quiet
ly and without public proclamation.
As a rule, he said, the laws had not
been modified.

TOKIO, Nov. 13.â A draft of the war
tax measure, which the Government
plans to submit to the Diet, which is
to meet on November 2S, shows a pro
posed increase in the import duties.
Divided among a large number of
articles, tha increase on individual ar
ticles is small, except in the case of
tobacco, glassware, beverages and ker
osene.
Among the articles on which it Is
proposed to increase the duty are ob
jects of art, ammunition, compasses,
crucibles, cutlery, electrical machinery,
agricultural Implements, fire extin
guishers, musical Instruments, surgical
and scientific instruments, photo
graphic apparatus, spectacles, tele
phones, thermometers, confectioneries,
preserves, grates, safes, stationery,
inks, straw paper, syrup, felt, spiritu
ous liquors, carriages, bicycles, pic
tures, alcohol, spirits, chemicals, cot
ton, brass, copper, lead, steel and gold
and silver wares. The duties on a
number of articles exclusively of Chi
nese production are Increased. â¢
The budget to be submitted to the
Diet will be practically the same as
outlined in previous dispatches, except
that further reductions have been made
In ordinary Governmental expendi
tures.
Baron Sone Arasuke. Minister of
Finance, answering the criticism of the
terms of the recent foreign loan, said
that the loan was unsatisfactory to the
Government, but the delay In captur
ing Port Arthur and the departure of
the Russian Baltic fleet had created a
hitch in the negotiations and had com
pelled the acceptance of terms less ad
vantageous than those of the first for
eign loan.
News \ras received In this city last
evening that James M. Conlan, a
brother of Police Judge C. T. Conlan.
dropped dead on the streets of Dixon,
Cal.. iate Saturday night. The au

Conlan, but messages sent the Judge
did not reach him, as he was spending

James Conlan was employed in one
of the wineries of the Sacramento Val

on farms near Dixon. Heart disease

cars .are stalled, railway trains are
greatly delayed and there is a general

night as the result of what is said to
be the severest snowstorm York ever
experienced at this time of the year.
It is estimated that snow fell to a
depth of a foot on the level.
The city Is In darkness owing to the

NEW YORK. Nov. 13. â Thomas E.
Watson to-day gave out the following
statement:
It should be borne in mind that at the time
the Springfield convention tendered me thÂ«
Presidential nomination the People'* party had
no real existence as a factor In national poli
tics for eight years. In tho Presidential elec
tion of 190O it gave to it* nominee only 5000
votes. To that extent had the fusion Â©f 1896
swallowed up a movement which la 1884
counted nearly 2,000,000 . of voteÂ« and about
1500 active newspapers. Therefore we bad to
build from the ground up in 1804. We had
almost nothing to start with in the way of
party organisation, campaign funds and news
paper support ; we had only three months la
whlca'to work. ThÂ«8e things being firat con
sidered, some fair idea of what was acoora-
Cllshed can be bad only when the official re
turns are known. Up to this time no official
statement has been made of the vote, and I
can only guess what it was from information
conveyed to me by friends In various parts of
the country. These sources, of course, are not ;
very reliable. Basing an estimate upon them,
however, my opinion Is that I received some
thing like a half million votes, scattered
through so many Btates, North and South,
East and West, as to indicate that the
sentiment which gives lta moral support to
the People's party Is national and not sec
tional. I have found everywhere that the
current was strong and deep in favor of Jef
fersonlan Democracy. I believe to-day that it
all those who believed in that theory of gov
ernment could be united in harmonious action
we could sweep the country.
ONUS PUT UPON CLEVELAND.
Mr. Roosevelt's overwhelming majority was
not ao much due to the fact that our people
believe In class legislation and the reign of
special privileges. â¢ It was not by any means
an indorsement of corporation tyranny, the
Â«reed of the trusts or the methods of com
bined capital. Mr. Roosevelt's majority over
Mr. Parker was due mainly to two thinOT. j
One was the immense personal unpopularity
of Mr. Cleveland's second administration. Un
fortunately for Mr. Parker, he becama so
completely identified with the marauders who
plundered . the Government during Cleveland's
second administration that he had to beer all
the odium which they had Incurred. The poo
ple have never had a chance to show Just what
they thought of that second administration.
Mr. Bryan's two campaigns did not give
them the opportunity. It was only when the
old Cleveland combination secured the defeat
of Brxan and Hearst and dictated the nomi
nation of Mr. Parker that the masses got the
opportunity to vent upon a national candidate
the intense hatred which they had been nurs
ing for years against such men as OIney and
Belmont and Carlisle and Cleveland himself.
They knew that I could not be elected, and
they were bo eager to make the best of the
opportunity to safeguard the country against
a repetition of that saturnalia of class legisla
tion which marked Cleveland's second adminis
tration that they rushed to Roosevelt pud gave
him a majority which does not under* ordinary
circumstances belong to the Republican party.
In other words, the personality of Mr. Roose
velt and the unpopularity of Mr. Parker's en
vironment carried into the Republican col
umns vast multitudes of men who under or
dinary circumstances would not be found
tUere, 1 " . ,
My own plans for the future embrace a I
complete organization of the people along: the .
lines of Jeffersonian Democracy, the re-estab
lishment of reform and a systematic propa
ganda of Jeffersonian principles In order that
In 1908 there shall be a party of genuine oppo
sition to the Republican party and Its present
policies. If political history teaches anything,
it is that old parties never accomplish any
reform unless they are Irresistibly driven to
It by pressure from without. I hope at leant
to be of some use to my country In aiding
those who will apply that pressure. It Is Im
material to me who does the work which re
formers want done, so that the work itself is
done.
I have no faith whatever that reforms will
be accomplished by the Democratic party. It
Is discredited in the eyes of tho people by ft
series of crushing defeats, but it has been eo
vacillating in its course. It has changed Its
principles so often, has run from one extreme
to another so recently, had such a magnificent
opportunity In 1802 to work out the reforms
to which It stood pledged and made such
wretched use of that opportunity that It can
not inspire thÂ» confidence which lead* to suc
cess. Since lf%2 the Democratic party has al
most entirely boxed the compass in political
profession of faith. It has been for pretty
much everything until this year, when it stood
for everything or nothing, according to the
interpretation which the voter chooses to put
upon Its ambiguous platform. ,
BRYAN NOT THE "WHOLE SIIOW."
Mr, Bryan, while a great Democrat, is not
the Democratic party. There are other distin
guished Democrats who are yet to be heard
from, and they may not Indorse his Populist
platform. There Is John Sharp William* of
Mississippi ; there Is Joseph W. Bailey of Texas;
there 1* Senator Ben TUlmaa of South Caro
lina; there la Senator Morgan of Alabama;
there Is Senator John R, Daniel of Virginia;
In fact, there are quite a number of dlsingulshed
Democrats who may claim the right to put in
a word before the next national Democratic
platform is fixed. They may not be willing to
take, for Instance, Mr. Bryan's forty-seven
different systems of government railroads; they
may not be in favor of some other planks in
his platform. Be that as It may, Mr. Bryan
has no more right at the present to aay what
the Democratic platform shall be In 1903 than
j any other ulsttngulaned Democrat. Tor the
next four Tears the Democratic creed must re
main what the St. Louis convention of 1904
made It. and the machinery of the party must
remain In the hands of the men who now
hold It. .
The air still rings with the eloquence with
which Mr. Bryan indoised the candidate of
tho St. Louie convention; spoke of him aa the
Moaes of Democracy; spoke of Parker's Ideals
aa hit own ideals and proclaimed the "sin
cerity" with which he was advocating both the
platform and the nominee of 1904. Mr. Bryan
himself will remain for four yÂ«ar* aa much
bound by the action of the St. Louis conven
tion as he was when ha made his whirlwind
trip through Indiana. If the action at the
convention bound him then, It binds him now.
The election did not release him. Be can only
bÂ« released by another national convention,
an! the national convention will not meet till
1908. Therefore, when Mr.' Bryan cuts loose
from a platform which he so recently asked
the people to Indorse In behalf of Judge Par
ker he takes a position which is that of Bryan
the individual, and which cannot bind any
other Democrat whatsoever. For - four years
the Democratic party has got to stand by the
action of the St. Louis convention, whether
they with to do to or not. What .they did
there is official and binding. Mr. Bryan him
self gave It his sanction.
Again, Mr. Bryan has no , substantial rea
son for believing that he can ever get the
National Democratic party to adopt the Popu
list programme which be has Just formulated.
The Democratic party never did do It, and the
presumption .Is that It never will. The plu
tocratic element has Just as much power with
in the party now as it had when the St.
Louis convention met. Indeed, â¢ It has more.
It has all the machinery now which the Bryan
men then had. It has the same control over
the newspapers which it then had; therefor*,
it is as certain as anything can be that they
will ' again be able to defeat Mr. - Bryan In the
-national, convention when he cornea before it
with his Populist platform.
EFFICACY OP THE KHIFE.
Suppose, however, j that he . should be vic
torious over them in the national convention â
can they - not knife him as successfully Â¦ as
they <ild in 1S0O? Is 'it not absolutely certain
that they are Just as much joined to their
idol* now as they were then? Will they not
be u desperate and unscrupulous In knifing
their cwnttcket as -they were In 1896? Every
argument based on human nature says they
Â¦ will. Then, - if .. Mr. Bryan should â¢; win < the
nomination of his Populist platform in 1908 the
plutocratic element In his own party will - bar
his progress and encompass his defeat just as
, they ' did before. - Again, suppose that the
pfutocratlc 'Â¦ element â¢ should r triumph over Mr.
Bryan in 1008 as they , did in 1901, then : Mr.
Bryan will have to submit Just as he did sub
mit in 1904 â after ;> having declared publicly
and i positively that he would never support a
goM . standard -nominee for .the Democratic
party. Mr. Bryan could not bolt in 1908. -The

which the man is charged is that of
arson. It was committed in the State
of Ohio about ten years ago, but
under the Ohio State laws arson is not
dealt with .in the statute of limita

by Letcher to-night, committed suicide.
Letcher has a son, a dentist in San
Francisco." His bail is fixed at $20,000.
The complaint upon which the police
acted came from State Fire Marshal
Davis, and was supplemented by in
formation from Attorney C. G. Nagle
of San Francisco, from which it ap
pears that Letcher's accusers charge
him with being the ringleader of a band

arson. -It is alleged that Letcher also

SAN JOSE, Nov. 13.â George E.
Letcher, a well-known capitalist, aged
about 50 years, was arrested hereto
day on the charge of being a fugitive
from justice from Williams County,
Ohio- It is charged that he was in
dicted a year ago by the Williams
Grand Jury for the crime of arson.
The President's palace was strongly
guarded until midnight! It is rumored
that, a dozen persons were killed and
that sixty were injured. An intermit
tent fusillade continues. y i"
RIO DE JANEIRO. Nov. 13.â The op
position to the compulsory vaccination
law led to fierce rioting: to-day. The
troops repeatedly charged the mob,
barricades were erected a.nd water and
gas mains were cut, plunging the city
into darkness, and street cars were
burned. The demonstration has every
characteristic of a revolution.
Let San Francisco ' become a leader in good
government by turning out the mischief work
ers and evil counselors â thieves and rascals
in the temple, and by putting in men of hon
esty, integrity and devotion to our moral and
every welfare.
M\ of this ia gratifying to the patriots and
lovers of good . government, for the spectacle
of great cities in tha hands of corrupt offi
cial*, notoriously guilty of graft, .mismanage
ment of public affairs and violation of oath
is doing much to destroy the claim made by
the New York Sun a- few years ago that "if
anything has been demonstrated beyond the
possibility of cavil. It Is that the American
can be trusted to govern well."
â¢ It must be recognised.' however, that this Is
no time to rest en our oars. Sleep is not in or
der. Activity is demanded.
The preliminary victory won is a strong in
centive to further endeavor until San Fran
cisco is as proud of her city government as
she Is of her geographical situation and her
growing commercial Importance.
â¢ There Is encouragement in j the hard blows
graft and public corruption have received in
other places. Good citizens of all parties will
rejoice over the election of Joseph W. Folk as
Governor cf Missouri.
All honor to the press, tae leagues, the asso
ciations and the untrammeled voters fcr the
clean victory won. Â»
The newspapers axe to be congratulated also.
It has beÂ«n demonstrated that the press Is
not only a medium, for the circulation of the
world's news and a channel of advertising,
but that it is also a great factor in molding
and directing public thought and action.
The Call and other papers, almost without
exception, sounded forth the warning, and
clean and honest citizens shuddered to think
of the consequences and. determined to re- 1
buke and repudiate these false and unworthy
leaders,- Trent to the ballot box and magnifi
cent ly defeated their candidates.
"A Grave for Grafters" was the post
election prelude to an evening sermon
delivered in Simpson Memorial Metho
dist Episcopal Church last evening by
the Rev. James H. N. Williams, the
pastor. He said:
Grafters and public corruptionists in Sao
Francisco have been given notice by the pub
lic not only of its disapproval of dishonesty
in DUblic officials, but to prepare for politi
cal burial. Law and order and public de
cency have simply triumphed at the polls in
the re-election of Judges Seawell. Murasky,
Troutt and Kerrigan. Not only are these
Judges to be congratulated en their election,
but the city and State are to be congratulated
alFC Such victories strengthen confidence In
the rule of the pÂ«ople and inspire hope for th<*
future.
Davitt stated that he had no Intention
of making any speeches here. He ex
pects to stay only about three days In
St. Louis, and will- hurry on to New
York with the view of returning. to Ire
land on the same steamer that brought
him to this country.
Michael Davitt of Dublin, Ireland's
famous advocate of home rule, arrived
from the East last night and is regis
tered at the Palace HoteL He is here
simply on a pleasure trip and expects
to remain only a few days. Davitt
came to the United States to visit the
St. Louis Exposition, from which he
came direct to this city. He expects to
revisit St. Louis next week.
Discussing the political situation in,
Ireland he said last night that the peo
ple were well satisfied with the out
look for home rule. After the coming
elections, he said, there was good rea
son for believing that another success
ful move toward the end so long sought
by the Irish people, would be made, and
he declared that he was confident that
not many years would pass before Ire
land would be enjoying the privilege of
handling Its own taxes and using them
for the betterment of her conditions.
He said last night:
The successful application of the Wyndnam
land bill has beftn an encouraging sign for
those who have strussled so hard for the home
rule measure. The transfer of lands from the
landlords to their tenants has, of course,
been going on eince 1SS5, lone before the
adoption of the Wyndhiun bill. Duriuj that
period about 90,009 tenants have taken over
fanniny land at a cost of about $20,000,000,
â¢w-hich the Government has advanced them,
and I us proud to eay that of â¢ the. entire
amount in which the tenantry has obligated
itself not mare than $1000 In payments have
been in default. ThÂ» pÂ«ople have been re
markably punctual in their payments, which
plainly suggests prosperity onion? them.
At present the agricultural conditions of Ire
land are not as good as th â might be, a
fact TThich Is directly attributed to the largo
emlgratlcn to this country. ThÂ« anti-emigra
tion movement has been a failure. Strive as
we may to keep the young Irishmen at home,
they cannot fall to appreciate the great" In
ducements for advancement that the United
States ofTers them. Much of the present emi
gration to this country Is due to the fact that
there is hardly & family in Ireland that has
not a relative prosperinsr in this country, and
when Bridget. Mary. Patrick or Henry re
ceives a letter from a relative in the -United
States reciting the success that has rewarded
the writer's efforts in his new home, there is
a hsjrty packing o' traps and a hurried de
parture for the land of promise.
With me on the Cedric crossing: the Atlantic
on my last trip trere SCX> young Irishmen
bound for various parts of this country, all
hopeful of success. They were by no means
poor. On the contrary they all had money
which might nave been successfully Invested
In their own country. I am satisfied, how
ever, that after we hare been conceded home
rule and are allowed to collect and disburse
our own taxes ,we will be able to divert the
meney into projects for bettering our. home
condltions*and enÂ«mragjnjr Induntries and. In
this way Ftay the tide of emigration that has
b*Â»n so Injurious to our progress as a race.

The two women had failed to pay (
the rent for the flat they occupied and
on Friday were dispossessed. At the
same time their furniture, which they
had bought from an installment com
pany, was taken from them, and they
were given permission by the Janitor
to remain in the flat over Sunday.
"For this consideration,** the letter
continued, "we give our "bodies for
the benefit of medical science."
In the hand of the younger woman [
was an open letter, written in German, j
which stated that the sisters had de- |
cided to die together after talking !
over the situation for a week and re
quested that they be buried in one i
grave.

EVICTED SISTERS EXD
THEIR LIVES WITH GAS
Three fraternal delegates from for
eign countries have responded to the
invitations sent out by the council to
France, Germany and England. These
delegates are: William Abraham,
representative of the Trades Union
Congress of Great Britain; James
WLynall. general organizer of the
Dockers* Union, also representing the
Trades Union Congress of Great Bri
tain, and J. A- Flett, president of the
Trades and Labor Congress of Canada.
These delegates will be present
throughout the session as guests of
the Federation, but *rfH have no vote.
Mr. Abraham, who is a member of
Parliament and is familiarly called
"Mabon," is the oldest member of
Parliament in England, having rep
resented Rhondda Valley, in South
Wales for the lost nineteen years. He
Is a coal miner and president of the
South Wales Miners' Federation.
Although wearied by the Ions ride,
Mr. Abraham finally consented to be
interviewed. He said that the out
look for labor representation in the
British Parliament was never so
bright as at present. A fortnight ago
there was an election iÂ« Wales, v.-here
Tom Richards, secretary of the South
Wales Miners' Federation, was elected
to Parliament by a large majority.
The addition of Richards makes thirÂ«
teen labor men in the House of Com
mons.
Fraternal Delegate James Wignall
of Swansea, England, expressed him
self as pleased with the labor outlook
in Great Britain and was hopeful that
in the near future a powerful inter
national federation would arise. He
added that he and his associate. Mr.
Abraham, were fflad to avail them
selves 6f the privilege of visiting the j
session and said that they had been I
rpyaHy treated since their arrival in
Nev,- York.
J. A. Flett, fraternal delegate from
Hamilton, Ontario, echoed the senti
ments of his compatriots and spoke
more hopefully of the idea of Ameri
can trade combination with Canadian
labor un'ons.

progress is the presence of two dele
gates from Porto Rico: Santiago
Ig-Iesi.is from San Juan, organizer of
labor unions in Porto Rico, and Este- i
ban Padilla, from Arecibo. delegate J
to the federation convention. This i
is the first appearance of Porto Rican !
labor delegates on the floor of the
convention and their legislative en
deavors will be watched with appre
ciation.
In s;>eakir.gr of the work of the
Porto Rico delegation Senor Ig-Iesias
said that he and his colleague, Senor
Padilla. represented 110 unions of
Porto Rico, and that more were or
ganizing. He considered it a phenom
enal record for only two years and. a
half of American Federation work. -
Senor Ig-^esias spoke in the highest
t^rms of the attitude of Porto Rico's t
Governor, Beekman Winthrop, toward I
the labor movement and said that the j
workingman was assured of a fair I
deal under the Governor's administra
tion.
The Porto Ricans will present to
the convention a petition for moral
and financial aid in the spreading of
th<? doctrine of federation through
the island. Senor Islesias said that
it was an economical rather than so
cial visit the delegation was paying,
and that the industrial affairs of Porto
Rico are in a bad -way financially. He
expressed the hoj>e that the federa
tion would aid in procuring better
conditions.
Last night at the Russ House, the
HEPPNER. Ore., Nov. 13.â As the re
sult of a auarrel between Frank Nat
tor and T. CL Cresswell, both well
known citizens of that place, Nattor
was shot, to death and Cresswell
wounded.
The men became involved In a quar
rel Saturday evening, daring which
Cresswell struck Nattor over the head :
with a club, for which offense Cresswell i
was arrested. Nattor followed Cress- i
well to the City Recorder's office later
and there renewed the quarrel, as an
outcome of which Cresswell shot Nattor
three times, killing him instantly- Dur
ing the melee Cresswell was shot in
the mouth and slightly wounded, but
it is not postively known by whom, as
Nattor*s revolver had not been fired.
Nattor was a saloon-keeper, but was
well thought of in the community.

.rrake a final settlement with all of you peo
plÂ«." HI* actions frighten-d me terribly, and
my dauirhtrr trif-d to quiet her husband. She
cried to him. "bera, act like a good fellow.
You've frigMened mother aod you had better
leave."
With that Campbfll, my daughter and my
self went out into the hallway. Campbell took
hiF oorcuai, put it over hla left arm and I
started to coen the front door. As I did I
saw the flash and heard the report. Laura
grasped her side, crying, "Oh. mother,"
turned and run into the dining-room. 8ne
kept on through the kitchen, out Into the back
yard and hid under the windmill there.
Campbell followed her to thÂ» kitchen and fired
a second shot 'aa she ran out of the back door.
The bullet etruck the door casing and lodged
In the back porch. Then he ran back through
the house, grahbed Mr. Cutler's hat. leaped
down the front- Â«tÂ»pÂ« and disappeared.
CAMPBELL'S VERSION.
Campbell asserts that he shot his
wife because he feared she would shoot
him. After sullenly refusing all day to
talk about the case he made the fol
lowing; statement to-night to Police
Captain W. J. Petersen:
My -Kit* had been trying to feat me to return
ana live with her. But I would not do so t>e
cauaÂ« of her conduct toward me. EhÂ« had
been telephoning for me to go to the. house,
and that was why I went there last night.
After she had asked me tÂ» return I told her
I should not.
."You've ruined me," I said, "and I shall
not h&re anything more to do with you.":. -
"Well, you're mine anyway until the 17th of
thiÂ» month," replied my wife, meaning until
the interlocutory decree had expired. She cofi-
UnuÂ«d: "I'll keep you anyway."
We quarreled and 1 showed my pistol. As I
did so she said:
"I've, as good a pistol eÂ» you have."
I didn't knew whether she bad or not, and
then I shot her. ,
Campbell complained that his wife*
had accused him of associating with
other women. He, in return, had
charged her with keeping company
with other men. Campbell said he went
as far as Pinole after he fled from
tbe scene of the shooting, but returned
to OaklarfU. While coming through
Emeryville Campbell was stopped by a
deputy constable, who took away his
ptatol. The officer, apparently, had not
learned of the shooting, and did not
know the man's identity, for no at
tempt had been made to detain the
fugitive. Later Ahern arrested' him,,
Campbell lives at 869 Filbert street.
OAKLAND, New 13.â With his bead
swathed In bandages covering a mass
of cuts and bruises, Lem Campbell, the
butcher who murderously shot his di
vorced wife, Mrs. Laura Cutler Camp
bell, at her parents' residence. 1262
Eleventh street, last night, because she
refused to live w ith him again, present
ed a miserable spectacle to-day at the
City Prison. No formal charge has
been registered against Campbell,
pending the result of the bullet wound.
Though Mrs. Campbell is very ser
iously injured. Dr. R. T. Stratton. the
receiving hospital euwgeon. said there
vu n fair chance of recovery. Cora -
plications from the wound are the only
obet&cles that ar* feared. Either blood
poisoning or peritonitis might ensue,
said the surgeon. Otherwise the young
woman's case is hopefuL The bullet
that wounded Mtb. Campbell struck a
corset Â«teel and carried the metal rib
doubled up Into her body. Almost mir
aculously, neither the bullet nor the
steel touched any part of the vital
organs In 'its passage. . Both the mis
sile ajid the steel were removed. Â¦
HUSBAND FIGHTS POLICEMAN.
Alter the shooting Campbell's' flieht
was followed by an alarm which 8et
every policeman in town on the track.
The detectives have not traced his
movements up to the time he was 6een
by Policeman Ahern this moraine at
Seventeenth and Peralta streets.
Ahern was standing there talking with
two men when be saw Campbell, whom
he knew, walking toward the sroup.
Ahern thought the butcher would run
if bÂ« saw the policeman, who hid be
hind the men with whom he was talk
ing. But Instead of running, Camp
bell made a movement of one hand as
if to reach for a pistol. They were bo
close that Ahern pulled bis pistol, at
the eame time grabbing Campbell's
hand, but finding it empty.
The butcher opened fight at once and
gave Ahern a hard tussle. The patrol
man got his handcuffs into Dlav. and
battered the man into submission. As
soon as Campbell was subdued he was
manacled and sÂ«nt to the Receiving
Hospital and patched up. while his
wife was groaning in pain there from
the wound he had inflicted.
â¢ "I have nothing to say," declared
Campbell to the police and to. all
others that tried to gain his version
of the 6hootlng.
The pistol which Campbell used was
found to-day at O'Meara's saloon.
Thirty-seventh street and San Pablo
avenue, where it had been left bv a
stranger. The weapon was emoty and
the hammer was thrown back and
Jammed so badly that it could not be
sprung.
MOTHER TELLS OF SHOOTING.
Mrs. Campbell has feared her former
husband. She knew the time was near
when her divorce from him would be
come final, nearly a Â»year having
elaps/>d since the interlocutory decree
was entered.' Her troubles that led to
the divorce were due, her parents de
clare, to Campbell's cruelty and in
temperance. When he went to the
Cutler residence last - evening he was
somewhat under the influence of lUjuor.
Both Edwin Cutler, the father of Mrs.
Campbell, and the young woman's
mother, who were present during the
first stajres of the trouble that caused
the ehootlng, agreed that Campbell
was In an ugly state, of mind. Mrs.
Cutler was a witness to' the shootiner.
She raid to-day:

ALAMEDA, Nov. 13.â While making
her way down a steep stairway at her
home on Post and .Madison streets
early this morning Mrs. Annie Serena
Christensen stumbled and fell to the
bottom. She was on her .way to call
her daughter, Mrs.. Lapham.. When as
sistance reached her she was found
dead. Fatty degeneration* of the heart
is given as the cause of the woman's
demise by Dr. J. A. Hiley, who was
summoned to attend her'and who per
formed an autopsy.
Mrs. Christensen was a pioneer of
this city and had lived with her daugh
ter, Mrs. Carrie Lapham, in the house
where. she met death. It was her cus
tom to awaken her daughter every
morning so that the latter, who is em

GRANTS PASS. Ore.. Nov. 13.â On
his last trip out over the pack-trail
from West Fork across the Coast
Range Mountains to Marial. Mail Car
rier McKenzie and a party of mininK
men * that he was guidinK over the
mountains, were confronted by a huse
black bear. The big bear squared him
self on the trail and showed fleht. re
fusing to let the party pass. The min
ing men, who were Indiana capitalists
and unaccustomed to encounters with
ferocious bears, suffered an exoerience
they had never before known, and
signified their willingness to give the
bear the right of way.
McKenzie was different. He Is a
mail carrier in the employ of Uncle
Sam and gives the road to nobodv.
bears included. He drew his rifle, and
when bruin raised himself on hla
haunches and opened wide his Jaws, a
well directed shot from the carrier's
rifle pierced his heart. After some lit
tle time order was restored amonsr the
Hoosier capitalists and the Journey
was resumed.
McKenzie, who has been on this mail
route for several years," says he ha3
seen more bears this year than ever
before. He has killed a half dozen
without dismounting. .

LEAVES YOUNG FRIEND
A HANDSOME LEGACY
By the Will of the Late Julia T. Moss,
Filed Saturday, Alice Morgan
Barber Receives $76,000. '
OAKLAND, Nov. 13. â With no near
relatives with a claim upon her, the
late Julia T. Moss leaves a large -part
of her estate, valued at $165,000, to
Miss Alice- Morgan Barber of Ham
burg, Germany. The deceased was the
owner of the property known as the
Mosswood on Broadway and also owns
cash and stocks amounting to many
thousands of dollars. ,
Miss Barber, the decedent states,
had been her friend for many years.
To reward her for her unselfishness
she . bequeaths to her a place at
Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, worth about
$40,000, and cash and stocks, which
bring her legacy up to $75,000. The
rest of the estate is divided among
twenty nephews and nieces of the late
husband of the deceased.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Nov. 13.
The influence of the Republican vic
tory in the recent election has already
had a marked effect on the local real
estate market, and in the short interval
since the result of the election was
known there has been an increase in
the demand for property In this city.
This increase has been principally for
business property in the mercantile
districts, and several dealers report
that almost as soon as it was definitely
known that the Republican party had
been victorious at the polls the mar
ket, which had been quiet during the
two weeks preceding the election, re
sumed its wonted activity.
One firm has begun arrangements for
the auction sale of several large, cen
trally located business properties. It
is expected that the sale will take place
In about three weeks. The auction
sales heretofore held in Oakland have
been so successful that it has been
decided to dispose of business property
in the same manner. The sale will be
held by the Realty Bonds and Finance
Company, but the exact location of the
property to be .sold has not yet been
made public-
A recent canvass of the hotels shows
that the influx of people from Eastern
States, which has been expected for
this winter, has already begun. Many
riewcomers have expressed the liveliest
satisfaction in the climate and natural
advantages of Oakland. There is but
little doubt that a number of these
visitors will decide to locate perma
nently in this city. In fact, several
have.^already been making inquiries as
to the location and price of residence
property, and one or two have inquired
as to the possibility of securing good
business or manufacturing sites.
FRUITVALE GROWS.
The eastern part of Oakland and
Fruitvale are now coming to the front
with rapid strides. Property In the
former locality^ which has been lying
idle for years, 'has been placed on the
market within the last three months,
and in some cases has been sold almost
as soon as offered. The population
of Fruitvale has doubled within the last
three years, and 75 per cent of the in
crease has been within the last twelve
months. There are now twenty-three
hundred school children" In the district.
Building operations continue with
unabated activity in spite of the near
approach of the, rainy weather, and it
looks ' as If contractors Intended to
make use of every pleasant day during
the winter. â¢ .- â¢ - -
The Oakland Real Estate Association
held its regular meeting yesterday aft
ernoon at the Metropole Hotel. Owing:
to the fact that the election was just
over there was but little business to be
transacted, and after a brief discussion
of minor business details the members
adjourned to the dining-room for the
monthly luncheon. About thirty mem
bers of the association attended the
meeting.
Frank J. Woodward of the Realty
Bonds and Finance Company, in ais
cussing the Influence of the election on
the realty market, said:
There Is no doubt that the victory of the
Republican party has had a stimulating effect
on the market, and, personally. I believe that
the assurance that the present administration
will continue in power will greatly Increase
our winter business. WÂ« have within the last
two days secured contracts for the sal* of
several large business properties, which would
not have been placed on the market had thÂ»
election gone the other Â¦way.
We will sell this property at auction and
I expect that the oale will be held within a
month. The Realty Bonds and Finance Com
pany has held several auctions during the last
year, and we have met with so much success
in these sales that we are encouraged to aell
business property in the same way. The prop,
erty heretofore sold at auction has been lo
cated in outlying districts and was suited
only for residence sites.
EASTERNERS INQUIRE.
George W. Austin of the Austin Real
Estate Company said:
Residents of Oakland have no idea how
many Eastern people have already arrived
here to spend the winter, but It Is a fact that
there is hardly a hotel In the city that has
not from two to a dozen families from Eastern
Htates. Many of these people have come here
for the' first time, and some of them are Â«ven
now considering the purchase ot property, in
tending to locate permanently In this city.
The market was rather quiet during the re
cent political campaign, but now that the elec
tion Is over business will soon pick up again;
In fact, the Influence of the Republican vic
tory has already been felt In real estate clr
clfls People who were inclined to hold off
until after the election now seem ready to go
ahead with business. We have several trans
actions pending, which I think will be closed
by the end of November.
BERKELEY, Nov. 13. â Another new

In the new list of stolen articles ap
pears a pair of field glasses taken
from Steffanoni's ' and photographic
supplies frjim Wood's.
Patrolman Shannon will be called be T
fore the Police Commissioners to-mor
row morning, when that, officer will
shed, some light upon the misdoings
of his less scrupulous fellow policemen.
He has explained in , brief to some of
his superiors that he had refused to
btand in and did not propose to permit
such actions on the part of any "man
on his beat, policemen not excepted.
Prosecuting Attorney Leach will not
be ready until to-morrow to give a de
cibion touching the sufficiency of the
evidence with which the four men
were confronted and that led to their
resignations.
Slowly there is. coming to light some
of the inside dÂ«tallÂ» of the means that
were adopted to bring to book the pa
trolmen and their delinquent sergeant.
It appears that the pilfering by police
men had been a anatter of common
gossip among some of the men at least
for months. In a way it got around
to . one of the newest appointees, Po
liceman Michael Shannon, a big, stal
wart Irishman, who -looked askance' at
some of the peculiar occurrences that
come under his- keen eyes. One night
ho. stood in a doorway and watched
Clark and Stahl fumbling about the
doorway of James Cahill's wall-paper
store on Thirteenth street, near Broad
way. They saw him after a while and
moved away. ! Shannon, suspecting
something was wrong, got under cover
and was rewarded by observing one
of the men later carry off a bundle of
wall paper that had been taken from
the store and hidden in the doorway
of the Merritt Hotel, a few doors away.
Special Policeman Newell Goodwin,
with Shannon, saw Clark and Hamer
ton enter the Buswell Paint Company's
store, 904 Broadway, take out a can of
paint and hide it In the entrance of
the Blake & Moffitt building. Sergeant
of Police Frank Lynch was notified,
and the can of paint was seized as
evidence.. It is in the possession of
Chief Hodgkins.
According to the data in hand no
less than seventeen business houses in
the heart of the retail district have
been visited at various times by one or
more of the men who have been dis
missed. Some of the information con
cerning the pilferings has been given
to the police officials by the men them
selves in their confessions. Other facts
have been furnished, by / Shannon,
Goodwin and Sergeant Lynch, who for
weeks had beenÂ«watching the suspected
men- The complete list of stores so
far as uncovered to date follows:

Whether or not Prosecuting Attor
ney Leach decides that there shall be
a criminal prosecution of former
Sergeant of Police Charles E. Clark
and Patrolmen Lee E. Andrews, J, vF.
fitahl and Charles W. Hamerton on
charges of burglary makes no dif
ference to the Board of Police and
Fire Commissioners so far as their
plans for the future handling of the
shop-pilfering scandal are concerned.
President John E. McElroy has de
cided that every detail connected with
the exposures shall be ventilated to
the fullest extent. So determined is
he upon this course that he insists
.that everything shall go before the
public, provided the knowledge can
not interfere with any prosecution
which might ensue. .
This course will be continued so far
as the Investigation ,of all other sus
pected patrolmen is 'concerned. Evi
dence is being collected daily against
several men whose names have not
yet been publicly connected with the
cases that have been brought to light.
The Commissioners individually have
been given information which is be
ing verifted. Chief Hodgkins has ex
plicit instructions to keep busv at this
Work. . He will not be permitted to
stop until the board has been satisfied
thoroughly that the Police Depart
ment has been purged. Along this
line of campaign much thought is be
ing spent by President McElroy and
his associates. They are planning as
to the future. It is current that there
will be developments at the next meet
ing of the Commissioners. - : .
In that regard President McElroy
said to-day:
I am surprised at the information that is
coming to me as a result of the exposure of
this thievery. By Friday next i *hall be
ready. I hope, to throw some further light on
Police Department affairs. It is my purpose
to pursue this subject relentlessly. No man
shall go free of well-deserved disgrace if 'it
shall be proved that he Is guilty of this mis
erable thievery.

I think that the strictly agricultural poa
sibllUics of California are usually neglected
in expositions. In fact, I flnd that 60 per cent
of the visitors to this exposition are surprised
to 'learn tliat California produces anything else
than- fruit. And many are almost Incredu
lous when they find In my exhibit Indian corn,
broom corn. oats, alfalfa and all of the gen
eral farm products.
When we tell an Illinois farmer that we
cÂ«m m*ke beef, pork, butter and* poultry for
one-half what these cost to produce in the.
choicest localities in the East, he is astounded.
Arid to this the statement that California Im
ports annually enormous quantities of those
commodities and we are setting forth condi
tions that are attractive to the kind -of peo
ple we nÂ»fld in our State, and suggesting lines
of production that are safe. .
that compel exhibiting under
clsusslficatlon are not as valuable to California
as tho*e that permit ' the State to make a
collective exhibit of all her resources in one
building. But California has been ably rep
resented . here. She has got such an ad
vertising as she never had before and it will
result in bringing many new people to the
State.

dried fruits have a health and food value
far above any. of the so-called health foods.
They are economical, delightful and nutritious.
The people of this country do not know this.
They have to be taught. It Is up to the grow

of these things by demonstration and adver
tising. Until they do, the markets will never
be sure, nor can the production be increased

Local Forecaster, temporarily In charge.
AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 13.â The search
for lost treasure amounting to more
than $100,000 of Mexican silver, which
is said to be lvlngr at the bottom of
Collins Lake in Leon County, this
State, will soon be commenced. A Joint
stocw company, composed of a number
of business men of Oakwoods, Texas,
and other citizens of that section, has
been organized for the purpose of con
ducting the serch for this burled or
hidden silver in a systematic manner.
â¢The company will drain the water
from this lake by means of powerful
steam pumps. The lake is situated
about fifteen miles south of Oakwoods.
It covers twenty-five acres of land and
the water is five to twelve feet deep.
According to the legend of this treas
ure a caravan of Spaniards were on
their way north in the early days and
the silver filled the bed of a large
wagon, which was being drawn by, six
mules. When near this lake an attack
was made on "the travelers by a band
of hostile Indians. In order to save the
silver the wagon was driven into the
lake and .its precious contents dumped
out. Only 1 one member of the party
escaped from the savages and it took
him many years to make his way back
to the City of Mexico, where he told
his story, but it was not believed and
he could get 'no assistance in recov
ering the treasure.
This survivor' is said to have left
a description, and a crude drawing of
the spot where the silver was hidden
and this he handed down to his son.
Still no effort was made" to recover the
treasure and it was not until ,the great
grandson of the survivor of the mas
sacre came into possession of the doc
ument that any movement was made
to secure the fortune. This great
grandson was without means himself,
but he managed to make his way to
Texas and by means of the records
and documents in his possession he
easily located the lake where the sil
ver is supposed to be deposited.
The story of the lost treasure is be
lieved by many people of the Collins
Lake section and those who have gone
Into the enterprise of draining the
lake are confident that they will find
the big fortune lying at its bottom.
Powerful pumping machinery is be
ing installed and the lake : ill be drain
ed as fast as possible. It will take
probably two months to pump it clear
of water.
W. N. Harris, who has charsre of
Kings County's interests, believes that
better^ results could be p obtained, bv
placing the State's exhibit all in one
building. He said:
-, An exposition of this magnitude is an anni
hilator of Â¦ sectionalism. -When one contem
plates the exhibits, and particularly those In
the - agricultural building, he Is constrained Â¦ to
stock up.lnthe use of superlatives , when -de
scribing the particular spot in the universe in
which he is most Interested. Among many
others California has made a wonderful show
ins, and In. point of variety has undoubtedly
outstripped' all competitors. ..â¢ In beauty of ex
hibit material and Installation' she. stands In
the front rank. And yet I have the same Im
pression regarding this exhibit that I have got
from- all v of the exhibits that California has
made In the last fifteen years. . .
. It Is no doubt a splendid, thing to exhibit the
beautiful fruits and fruit products of our State,
but without . demonstrating . their flavor; and

the consumption of these choicest of California
products. Unless the . consumption keeps, pace

The lesson which I have learned from this
exposition Is that there should, be concerted
action for the dissemination of the truth re
rardin^ thÂ« whole State of California. There
i., an immense amount of missionary work yet
to be done If we are to reap a complete har
vest from what was bo ably Initiated at St.
Louis. The plan at St. Louis, where the
State exhibit consisted of twenty-eight Individ
ual county exhibits, has proved effective and
should be carried out at 'Portland and at all
future expositions. There are those who favor
one general exhibit from which the coun
ties would h? eliminated, but for many rea
son* this would not prove as effective Â¦ as the
St. Louis plan. â¢
If the exact truth la to be known regarding
our State It Is necessary that all sections
should be repress r,ted by men well qualified
to explain their advantages. A lecture hall
should be provided by the State at all futurw
expeditions and the county representatives
Rhr.-'ld be given the free use of this hall for
the delivery of Illustrated lertures regarding
their sections. .The answer to any objection
that rnliht be raised in this Is that seven
county representatives lectured dally at the
gÂ£ Louis exposition and that In almost every
instance the lecturer voluntarily gave a large
part of his time to describing the climatic and
agricultural conditions existing throughout the
T.-::o:e State and never once. did I hear unfa
vorable comment made on any remark at any
of these lectures. " . ";
It in my opinion that the work done at St.
I-ouls will bring more than 100,000 people Into
California within the next year or two, and
tiiat most of those who come will arrive with
a fair knowledge of conditions throughout the
entire State. San Joaquln County will get her

MUST SHOW FOOD VALUE.
ALL WORK TOGETHER.
Colvln Brown of San Joaquin County
on the same subject said: 1 . ...
For th* first time in their history Northern
and Central California have been properly rep
resented at an exposition. For seven months
twenty-two representatives of counties from
Northern and Central California have been
explaining j to the visitors at the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition that Isothermal lines in
California run north and south; that the ther
mal belt In which the orange grows is five
hundred miles long; that there is Verjs. little
difference- In temperature, winter ; and sum
mer, between the northern end of the Sac
ramento â¢ Valley and the Mexican, boundary.
The wonderful systematic and energetic pr6
motlon work, which has been carried on by
the people of Southern California for the past
fifteen years or more, has resulted In a gen
eral, w'despread belief among the people of the
Kant that all of the sunshine, flowers, fruit and
scenery of California are to be ftfund In that
part' lying south of the Tehachapy_ A partial
correction of this error will be the best return
Ihn State will receive from the work which .the
countlf? have been doing at St. Louis. It is
better for the whole State that the truth con
cerning Cnllfcrnla should be known, and my
experience was that the â¢ representatives of
Southern California themselves recognized this
and encouraged the northern and central men
In their .efforts to disseminate the truth.
As San Joaquln County lies In Central Cal
ifornia the greatest good It will derive from
the work done here will come from the edu
cation which the people of the East, and
the world, have received regarding true con
ditions In California. Incidentally, the re
sources of San Joaquin County have been
brought directly to the attention of many
thousands of people, including hundreds of
prospective settlers, but nev*r, to my knowl
edge, to the disparagement of nny section of
our State. It Is a matter, that I pride . my
self on that none of those connected with the
San Joaquln County exhibit ever let his local
loyalty affect their loyalty to the whole State,
and 1 believe that this Is generally true of
all the counties represented ftt the fair, re
gardlers of geographical position.
MUCH YET TO BE DONE.
The first and greatest reason that San Luis
Obispo County has derived advantage from Its
exhibit and representation at the St. Louis
Kxposltion 1a that equal recognition with other
and better- advertised counties has been ob
tained. Until very recently San Luis Oblspo
County was valued only as a stock and grain
rection. Our exhibit at the fair demonstrates
the possibilities of this county of vant resources
in other things than stuck and grain.
San Luis Ob'spo County, by reason of Its
wonderfully diversified exhibit here, haa made
known to thousands of people from ever}' sec
tion of the United States | and many foreign
countries that we are on an equality with' the
best adveitised sections of California. That
ours lÂ» one of the most favored sections of the
State multitudes of people have learned.
Among other lessons taught by experience in
the maintenance ol our county exhibit at the
fair Is that of the great need of dispelling the
very t-rroimous idea which so generally prevails
regarding California land values. The great
majority of the people interviewed with refer
ence to California have been or the opinion tn.it
nothing short of $3()O to $500 per acre would
buy good fruit lands In our State. And when
they were told that fine land could be bought
for from $25 to $50 per acre in San Luis Oblspo
County, and In a flection where the average
rainfall for twenty years has been twenty-two
inches per year, thousands of persons learned
something of California th-Â»y had hitherto not
known.' This is a point that should be em
phasized if we would dispel a damaging mis
chief.
A vast number of World's Fair visitors have
been attracted to the joint exhibit of San LuÂ«<
Oblspo and Monterey counties. A large num
ber of these have signified their Intention to
visit these counties when they go to California,
and this number Includes the larger percentage
of the people Interviewed. Several families
have already gone.
In the selection and preparation of another
Â¦World's- Fair or similar exhibit, a ponfriderable
saving in expense may be made by minimizing
the number of specimens for exhibition.' Ex
perience has taught that only the unusual
specimens particularly attract. A few of the
very best . specimens exhibited in a very fine
and unique setting will bring the very best
results. The moat unique and most elegantly
finished booths in any of the exhibition palaces
at the fair are. these which attract the greateÂ»t
throngs, irrespective of the quality or variety
of the exhibits shown. When we may combine
elegance of setting with products we have
reached advertising excellence. ; . .
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING, ST. LOUIS, Nov. 13.â All of Cali
fornia's representatives at the fair
agree that the exhibit has been the
greatest advertisement the' Golden
State could have obtained with the
sum of money expended.
As it nears the time that 'the srreat
gates are to swing closed, there Is a
general feeling of satisfaction over
what has been accomplished. The re
sults so far obtained are, in the words
of one county representative. "simDly
the first crop." Commissioner Charles
A. Block of San Luis Oblspo County,
in speaking of the advantages his sec
tion has derived, said:
Special Dispatch to The Call.
There are now six prisoners in the
Charleston Jail implicated in the Mont
gomery shooting. It is not considered
safe to have the hearing of any of them
take place at the present time.
CHARLESTON, W.^Va., Nov. 13.â
Edward and George B. Jackson, the
two brothers of Montgomery, .W. Va.,
for whom rewards have been offered by
both State and county authorities, sur
rendered to-day and are now in the
County Jail in Charleston. The men had
been secreted in an abandoned coal
mine just outside of Montgomery and
were driven to surrender by hunger and
cold.
Since the shooting of Sheriff Daniel
and their j subsequent disappearance
they had spent . the time in the coal
mine, secreted from their pursuers and
the bloodhounds that were put on their
trail. During this time they were with
out food and drink.
The officials took the men around the
town of Montgomery and by a round
about way brought them to Charleston
to avoid a riot or lynching, which un
doubtedly would have occurred had the
citizens of Montgomery discovered that
the Jacksons had been taken.
As the idea appeals to the cultured
and equally to all persons who appre- !
ciate the advantages and delights of a ,
forested suburban park for the enjoy- i
ment that it affords, there is a proba
bility that the first meeting of a series
will be made interesting and profitable.
Invitations will be sent to the Tamal
pais National Park Association, the
Sempervirens Club, the California State
Floral Association, the Native Daugh
ters of the Golden West,' the Sierra
Club and to other organizations to send
delegates to the meeting of next Satur
day that the importance of the sub
ject may be generally, understood and
that interest may be aroused as much
as possible.
Mrs. Pohli and Miss Hlttell have made
a study of the possibilities of the pro
posed park at Redwood Canyon. To a
representative of The Call .these ladies
said that they have found a strong cur
rent of public favor running in the di
rection of acquiring and holding
Redwood Canyon as a forest park. Its
beauties are well known to thousands
of citizens. The Bohemian Club held
jinks there for some years. All sum
mer visitors to Marin County see and
are delighted with the canyon.
From the canyon Mount Tamalpais
towers up in view like an obelisk. The
canyon's forested aisles are shaded with
trees that have existed for centuries.
Its surface is particularly well adapt
ed to forestry park purposes, being
level. Off (o the westward and not far
distant is the Pacific Ocean. From Mill
Valley it is an easy walk, taking only
a short time to the heart of the canyon.
There are no other comparable trees in
proximity to a great city any
where in the world. It is urged by the
ladies that there is no other forested
park in California as near to a great
body of citizens as is this. Through the
canyon flows a beautiful stream of
water that comes from the side of
Mount Tamalpais. â¢Â¦â¢., - - â
One reason for urging the acquisition
of Redwood Canyon - for a park at
this time Is that it is threatened. The
present owners are in negotiation with
parties who will probably cut down the
trees and sell them for their timber
value, afterward selling the land for
farming use. The nearness of the can
yon to the city would enable tillers ofc.
the soil to profitably work the land. To
lose the present chance to create such
a park as is proposed probably means
that another will never be offered. Able
speakers will address the meeting next
Saturday at the California Club's
rooms. At that meeting, or at a subse
quent one, views of the canyon will be
displayed. All persons who desire to
preserve the natural beauties of Cali
fornia will be asked to co-dperate in
this movement to create and. maintain
a public park in Redwood Canyon.
Next Saturday at 10:30 o'clock a meet
ing will be held at the rooms of the
California Club to promote a plan that
lovers of the beautiful in nature have
in view to save from destruction the
forest that adorns Redwood Canyon,
in Marln County near Mill Valley, and
to have the canyon held as â¢ a public
park for the benefit of the people of
California for all time. This proposi
tion originated with ladies in the for
estry section of the California Club.
Mrs. Emil Pohli and Miss Hlttell have
strongly Identified themselves with the
movement, working with a degree of
enthusiasm and energy that should
entitle their efforts to the reward of
success. Vanderlyn Stow and other
men have also become interested in the
project.

SPARE THE ROD.
ON the same day California and Washington, the two leading
maritime States on this coast, voted on a constitutional amend
ment to exempt American shipping from State, county and lo
cal taxation. The amendment carried in Washington and was
beaten, as far as known, in California. The indifference of our peo
ple to a matter of such vast import is inexplicable. San Francisco
gave the amendment a small majority, but Oakland and Alameda
County seemed to enjoy great satisfaction in defeating it by a large
majority.
We admire consistency, and Oakland was certainly consistent,
for she had just voted down bonds to increase the size and safety
of her own wharves on her own harbor. But that city is getting
millions out of the Federal Government to make a harbor where
nature failed to put one. Along that harbor private capital has
planted extensive yards for the building of American ships. But

tion of her charms and her romance.
These tributes to her vanity serve mere,
ly as an advertisement of her folly.
They help to mark her as a woman
who has made a mistake.
There is no escape from Vhis conse
quence of her Indiscretion. Until old
age she will be pointed out as "a wom
an who eloped," and it will not take
many years for this distinction to be
ccme distasteful to her.
Furthermore, if her marriage turns
out unhappily she will get more than
half of the blame, even though she does
not deserve it. "What can you expect?"
people will say.
She lowered herself in her husband's
regard at the very beginning of their
life together by the clandestine way
that she married him. And the saddest
part of it all is that there will be at
least a grain of truth In this popular
opinion.
"Love without esteem," says Dumas
fils, "cannot reach far or fly high; it
is an angel with but one wing."
If a , couple of young lovers whose
marriage is opposed by their elders
would only have the patience to wait a
little all would turn out well, or at least
for the best. Parents are not often un
reasonable.
It is natural that a father who un
derstands the temptations of men' and
the difficulty of making a decent liveli
hood should wish to hedge his daughter
about by every safeguard, and should
be slow to consent to her marriage with
a young fellow who has not yet had a
chance to prove himself. :'â¢, 'â¢'â¢""
It is not strange that a mother who
has known the suffering and privations
of bringing up a family on a small in
come should hesitate to give up her
daughter to" a man whom she has no
particular reason to trust.
If a young man Is not able to see any
point of view but his own In his woo
ing, if he urges upon a girl a course of
conduct which is doubtful in its expe
diency, one which may later bring her
regret, he does not really love her â he
loves himself.
And if she yields to his persuasions he
never will love herâ as it is her woman
ly right to bÂ« loved. After marriage he
will simply go on lovingâ himself.
A girl cannot afford to make herself
or her love common in any way. She
has too much to lose. Once she is
talked about adversely she is at the
mercy of every unfavorable breath of
criticism that blows. She has sacrificed
the privilege which other women, more
discreet than herself, enjoy of doing
what seems right, fearless of censure.
An elopement or a secret marriage
never makes a girl appear to others as a
heroine, in spite of the fact that she
gets her name in the papers, with her
best photograph and a glowing descrip-
I THINK it would not be amiss for
me to say a word on the subject of
elopements and' secret marriages.
Indeed, I am eager to do this, for
I feel that any young girl who
loves a man without her parents' sanc
tion to his suit is like a ship without a
rudder, tossing helpless in a storm.
In her perplexities she has no one in
whom to confide except her loverâ who,
naturally, is biased In his own interest
âand possibly an intimate friend, who
has no more experience in life than her
self.
There is no other occasion in a wom
an's life when she needs her own people
about her so much as on her marriage
day. Then she is taking the most de
cisive step in her career, the step by
which her happiness and her honor
stand or fall. .''â¢â¢:::
She Is entering an estate from which
death alone can free her honorably.
Divorce, whether Justified or not from a
woman's point of view, leaves inva
riably a shadow on her name. The fact
that she herself is absolutely free from
reproach does not save her from humil
iation.
The Judgment of the world In regard
to these things still hinges upon a
prejudice, as hard and narrow as that
of the medieval knight of whom Mrs.
Browning sings in "The Romaunt of
the' Page." The wife who has, as the
poet expressed it, "unwomaned herself"
out of love for her husband, is doomed
to hear the latter Bay, in verdlot on her

preceding week. I
The feature of the week was the activity in stocks from one
end of the country to the other. New York stocks were remarkably
active, dealings being the heaviest for several years, and at rising
prices as a rule. Nothing could stem the eager rush to buy standard
bonds and dividend-paying stocks. Opinions from recognized finan
cial authorities that prices for stocks had been run up to the divi
dend-paying limit, and in some cases even over it, produced no
perceptible effect on the bull movement. The public were in the
market as buyers, and they bought right along. Once or twice the
daily transactions largely exceeded 2,000,000 shares. This may be
aptly compared with the dullness of last spring, when the day's
dealings several times fell to something like 100,000 shares. Here
in San Francisco there was a marked increase in activity on the
Stock and Bond Exchange, with prices for sugar and other stocks
advancing. Boston had a booming copper market.
This stock exchange activity in different parts of the country
was significant. It showed an abundance of money and a general
desire to invest, widespread confidence in the future and a boldness
oru}- witnessed in seasons of prosperity. If there had been any
doubt of the country's prosperity the public would have let stocks
of all kinds alone. While a stock boom is not to be desired and will
probably be vigorously checked by the great financial interests if it
grows to dangerous proportions, it has not thus far done any harm
and has been beneficial in* calling the idle money out of the vaults
and setting it again into circulation. If it is placed at a dividend
plane of values it will be well invested and will flow back into com
mercial channels in the form of dividends and interest coupon pay
ments ; but if placed above dividend values it will be tied up and
probably produce a reaction toward more reasonable quotations.
Some sagacious financiers think that that point has already been
reached. If it has not, it is not very far from it.
Stocks, however, are not the only line showing increased
activity. Many of the staples exhibit an expanded movement. Iron
and steel, coal, hardware, wool and its manufactures, hides and
leather, lumber and other building material, groceries, cattle, sheep
and hogs, paints, glass and numerous minor products are found in
the processional activity. The jobbers all over the country are
increasing previous orders more or less. Collections, already good,
are reported even better, especially in the West and South, where the
excellent corn and cotton crop prospects impart a general feeling
of confidence in another good year. Aside from the diminished
exports of wheat, it may be said that all the important staples show
gains over the past few weeks. Provisions are not active, but they
are holding their own, and the condition of the provision market is
a good barometer to trade.
- . Ojy. local conditions show no relapse. The Pacific Coast has
sent in excellent reports for six years and continues to send them
in, with no indications of a break. Our coast products, with the
exception of raisins and prunes, are moving out of producers' hands
as fast as they are harvested, and are bringing first-class prices. All
banks, city and country, report money plentiful at normal rates of
interest, and the magnitude of building operations, particularly in
San Francisco, is attracting general attention. This is a remarkable
era of business activity, and apparently the end is not yet.
THE election has come and gone and trade is running along as
briskly as before, under a full head of steam. There are no
signs* of slackening anywhere. Those skeptical ones who
thought that the current activity was largely fictitious and strained
to effect the election now admit that the expansion in business Â«is
genuine.
In spite of the election, which gave only five business days last
week, the bank clearings of the country showed a gain over last year
of 12.8 per cent, while the' failures were only 213, against 283 last
year. But it is worthy of note that about half of the more important
cities showed a loss in clearings, whereas during the preceding week
all but four showed a gain. The aggregate clearings, too, showed
a decrease, being $2,329,400,000, against over $2,800,000,000 for the

Oftentimes after Miss Henderson had

They grew and bloomed happily under
her care. What would not?
"Miss Henderson," began Bradford
one afternoon when she was leaving
early, "I am glad I added the word
'preferred' to my advertisement for a
stenographer three months ago."
The girl looked surprised, but she was
not.

When she asked If she might hare

"I will bring a little mirror and â a
towel and some soao in the morning;
Mr. Bradford, if you don't mind," she
said as she left. "Good night."
"A mirror!" Bradford sighed. This
was only the beginning. But he waa
always glad when nine- thirty arrived
and sorry when closing time came.
Business seemed to increase: he sent
out so many letters- Miss Henderson
Alone, Bradford lit a cigar and
leaned back in his desk chair. What
had he done? He had engaged a
woman, a girl, as a stenographer! She
would always be in the office; he could
not swearâhe wondered if he should
smoke â neither could he take off his
coat and put his feet on his desk when
he wanted to think things out and
bring an unruly customer to time.
But the next morning found him
eagerly waiting for 9:30. He could
not tell why, but the appearance of a
trim little tailor-clad figure In the
doorway made him glad.
"I â I may put my. hat on your
desk?" she asked, laying a neat felt
hat on the top of his desk. She had
only a flat table.
"Oh â oh, no," he said. "Let me â I
say, we will have to have a hook over
there above the wash bowl. Yes. put
it there." What a nuisance women
Â¦were he tried to convince himself. A
woman's hat on a man's desk!
An atmosphere of strangeness, of
embarrassment and awkwardness filled
the tiny, office all day, and yet Brad

felt like a cad talking to a woman
about salary. What did she know ofâ
of business?
"I believe It is the employer's pre
rogative to name tho salary," said the
girl Bimply.
Bradford after searching: hopelessly

"That will do very nicely," said the
girl rising. After all. this business
life was not so hardâ men were not so
heartless.
"And your name?" asked Bradford.
"Henderson â Marjorie Henderson,"
she said, smiling.
"And when will you conw?" Brad
ford surprised himself at thÂ» way in
which he let her suit her own con
venience.
"That, too, is your prerogative,** shÂ«
replied, an odd little expression of def
erence in her eyes.
"To-morrow? Is that too soon?"
He had not expected to have his sten
ographer until the following week,
but, after all, no doubt the sooner he
had one, the sooner his business let
ters would commence to brine: srood re

"Very well, to-morrow. And at what
hour?" This man had not told her
anything of his demands upon his em
ployes. She had "fancied herself de

to all of which she must adhere rieidly.
"Oh, about 9:30," he said. He had
decided when he had inserted the
advertisement that he would get to
business earlier and have his stenog
rapher there with him. But â oh, well,
women should not have to get down
too soon; it was hard on them.
"I will be there at that hour, Mr.
Bradford, thank you." And she closed
the door.
The girl saw this, but was too tact
ful to give evidence of the fact. "Yes,"
she said. "I have Just finished my
course in stenography."
Bradford liked her soft, well-modu
lated voice. It would sound well
to his customers over the 'phone. A
man's voice would not sound half so
well.
"Office work Is confining," he sug
gested, by way of discouraging her.
"Yes; but when a woman has to
make her way in the world, she puts
on a smile and faces the worst," she
replied, with just a suspicion of an
accent on the last word and with an
undeniably roguish twinkle in her
eyes. She could not Quito cast aside
the manner that had been her charm
in the old life. Family fortunes may
take wings and fly, but innate coquetry
is not to be stilled by mere financial
depression.
Bradford could not deny that her
emile had individuality. He wondered
why the women he had been forced to
meet had never smiled in just that way.
He never knew why, but he suddenly
wished the office ware cleaner. He
would certainly speak to the woman
who scrubbed and dusted in the build
ing..
"Yes, 'male preferred' is stated in
your advertisement," acknowledged
the girl, "but I wanted a position, my
first one, vary much . and â well. I've
come to see if Fate will be kind."
It was just like a girl to Introduce
such filmy, uncertain elements as Fate
Into business! And yet Bradford was
not so prejudiced as he had been ten
minutes before. He fancied the dingy
office was brighter already. Then,
there was another consideration;
women demanded smaller renumera
tion for their work, and this was still
a matter of moment with Bradford.
"This â er, you say is your first po
sition?" ventured Bradford, admit
ting, unconsciously, that the place was
hers already.
O^ORGE BRADFORD, Pur
chasing Broker," read the
girl, hesitating before the
door. She extracted a tiny
newspaper clipping from
her purse and reread it.
"Wanted: A stenographer; male pre
ferred. 16 Exchange place. G. B."
With trepidation she opened the
door and entered a small, unprepos
sessing office room.
"Good morning," said Bradford, ris
ing and then sitting down abruptly.
Business was business.
"Mr. Bradford ?" asked the girl,
handing him the clipping. "This is
your advertisement, I believe?"
"I â I had In mind a young man,"
began Bradford, obviously 111 at ease.

WINNIPEG. Nov: 13.â In a religious
disturbance that occurred in the Rus
sian colony here to-day, a bishop of
the Greek Church of America was
stripped of his vestments before hi3
congregation ,< by Gallicians, a dissatis
fied faction of the body, and in a bat
tle that followed the cathedral was
practically destroyed. , ;
A number of Gallicians, five of whom
were later arrested, attended church
and, while the bishop was preaching,
started to sing Russian comic soners.
The bishop expostulated at this, which
incensed the disturbers.
The Intruders, it is ohartred. seized
him while kneeling, tore off all his
vestments and cast them from the
cathedral. His crucifix and beads were
thrown through a window, and the
church ornaments followed. The van
dals then overturned the altar and
smashed everything they could get
their hands on.
Several of the faithful, who stood by
in silence, then made an attack on the
Intruders and rallied around the bishop,
with the result that the Gallicians
were driven off.
Bishop Serafin is looked upon as an
impostor by some of the Greek
churches, despite the fact that he has
been permitted to ordain priests. Lit
tle is left of the bishop's cathedral,
which was razed to the ground.

EXGAGEMEXTS.
The Association of Pioneer Women
ef California met on Friday afternoon
et its headquarters at Golden Gate
Hall.
With felicitations Mrs. Anna Mcln
tyre presented her successor In the
chair, Mrs. Agnes B. Macdonald, and
right gladly was she welcomed as pre
siding officer, although it was with
great reluctance that Mrs. Mclntyre
v as permitted to retire. It was under
II rs. Mclntyre's regime that the or
ganization founded by Mrs. Noble Mar
tin has risen to Its present prosperity.
The rpecial work now in hand by the
Pioneer Women is the preparation of a
memorial to the next Legislature pe
tioning for an appropriation to place
two statues of California's pioneers in
the art rotunda at Washington." Now
this matter has been thoroughly can
vassed in this column before- The ob
ject is most worthy, and the Pioneer
Women, by virtue of their priority of
residence and the honor due them in
*-onsequcnce, seem to be the proper
bedy to memorialize the Legislature.

The Mills Club convened last Tuesday
afternoon in the Sorosls clubhouse.
A muelc programme was given by
Mrs. Ingeborg Larsen. who sang "Oh,
3)ry Those Tears." and by Miss Mary
TaEmore and Miss Dorothy Pasmore,
v. ho played compositions for piano and
cello.
Professor Josiah Keep of Mills Col
lege addressed the members on "The
Poetry of Shells." This talk was not
only instructive, but rich with imag
inative beauty.
The Channing Auxiliary, Mrs. W. R.
"Wheeler president, provided an inter
esting afternoon for its members last
Monday, when the regular session was
held in the Unitarian parlors. A paper
on "Fiction as a Moral Agent," read by
Ztfrs. George Oulton. will live long In
the annals of the club. With a deft
Â¦usage of words, chosen with precision
to fit a delicate theme, Mrs. Oulton
eald, among other things, that "novels
reflect an impression of life, not a re
production." From the time of bards,
with their harps (who were the first
ctory tellers), the trend of tales has
been love and adventure^ â novels deal-
Ing with truth, romance with fiction.
In the realm of imagination fiction
thrives; imagination, God-given, is to
be freely used by all who strive for the
field of literature. Dumas' fiction Is no
ble, powerful and immortal, while Dau
det is the most graceful of French hu
morists."
The reader spoke of Balzac as under-
Standing supremely the pathology of
the affections, while she attributed to
George Eand the motherhood of nat
uralism, with Flaubert its father. The
closing lines of the paper claimed even
more attention than those preceding, as
the whole topic was cleverly sum
marized in a group of terse, compre
hensive paragraphs.
This is the type of paper that stimu
lates thoughtâ and blessed be the thing
that promotes thought! We can't have
too much of it in these degenerate
iflays of helter-skelter scrambling for su
premacy. The afternoon was pleasant
ly terminated by two violin solos, exe
ruted in fetching fashion by Miss Elsa
Fherman and Miss Mills.
The State Federation will convene

True, this is disciplinary, and seem
ingly harsh â when we all love so well
to hear our own voices â but it is a
Christian course, and the only sane
<ourse. Long sessions, it matter not
how good the papers are, will pall
when they spread their verbosity over
ri whole day â and when, as in these
glorious days, the fields are calling,
calling.
la all future gatherings of club
vomen the proclamation should go
forth to the farthermost ends of the
State that an annual convention is
not a clearing-house for the details of
club-housekeeping.
The dollars and cents spent by an
improvement club for the sprinkling
of streets or the placing of rubbish
<ans on cornera need not be expatiat
ed upon in detail. It is enough to
know that the club Is doing said work,
the correctness of the expenditures
being purely a domestic matter. And
Â¦Â«"ho, pray, would think of expatiating
in public upon the expenses of her
cvvTi household 1 The cases are
analogous. Clubs are households of
a large growth, and amenable to the
same laws of government as the
family.
Therefore, clubwomen, in the inter
ests of rood taste and progression â
and fewer headaches â in making your
future reports of club doings, don't â
pray don't â ko Into the Infinitesimal
details of your club work. For that,
there is no time, because it adds noth*
ing to the general Interest o* your as
sertions. We take it for granted that
your bills are correct. State explicit
ly what your club has done, or plans
to do, .and let it go at that; and let
the Ume be given to vital topics, such
as Juvenile Courts, Compulsory Bdu*
cation. State Tubercular Hospitals,
Preservation of Landmarks. Protec
tion of Forests. Reformation in Penal

world's welfare and happiness.
When time Is given to such topics

clubs with new things to think about
and new things to do. And therein
Is fulfilled the primal object of federa
tions and conventions â an interchange
cf ideas; and that these may be prop
erly ventilated, let us strive to elim
inate the unnecessary and meaning

The Papyrus Club, Mrs. C. Mason
Kinne president, held an interesting
session â no unusual thing, for none are
stupid â on Thursday last, when the
following programme was presented:
The club has made noticeable pro
gress during the last year by enlarg
ing its scope of work and the young
ladies who have labored so diligently
toward this end are Justly proud of
their success. In addition to its orig
inal home at 120B Welsh street another
has been opened at 1314 Natoma, and
the children of that vicinity are eager
ly taking advantage of the opportuni
ties. In fact, the little tykes attend in
such numbers that it has been found
necessary to increase the seating ca
pacity of both schools, as well as the
number of workers. Classes are held
on Wednesday and Friday afternoons
from 3 to 5 o'clock, the pupils being
Instructed in sewing, darning, morals,
manners and all things that tend to
their general improvement. A needle
work class is held on Monday after
noons at the Welsh street home and
in time will be held likewise at the
other. Visitors are heartily welcome at
either school on days mentioned.
The workers of the club accompanied
the children on a picnic to Golden Gate
Park last month and the little ones
had a glorious day on the green. The
funds for this picnic were contributed
by a benevolent and interested friend
of the Little Women Club. These out
ings in the fresh air are given as often
as possible.
The necessary expenses of the club
are defrayed by a membership list,
twenty-five cents paid monthly en
titling the sriver to be a member of
the Little Women Club.
The workers of the club are Misses
Charlotte and Fannie Redlick, Miss
Grace B. Wiener. Miss Rey del Valle,
Miss Jessie B. Zacharias, Miss Ella
Michael, Miss Eva Friedman, Miss
Gertrude Mayers, Miss Lily Elias ana
Miss Essie Golden.
Clever little women, these, and bless
ings on them!
The Little Women Club held its an
nual Installation at the last regular
meeting of the club. The following
took office for the ensuing term: Pres
ident, Miss Charlotte K. Redlick; man
ager. Miss Grace B. Wiener; secretary,
MIes Jessie B. Zachariaa; treasurer.
Miss Fannie G. Redlick.
A regular meeting of the Consumers*
League was held Wednesday afternoon,
November 9, President Mrs. Sylvia
Brown in the chair. Reports of com
mittees were made. In the line of
work of the committee for arousing
public sentiment it was ordered that
placards be printed, distributed and
requested to be displayed in public
places, urging the purchasing public,
by early shopping, to lighten the labors
of the women and children employed
in the stores at the Christmas season.
The regular meeting day of the league
was changed to the third Monday in
each month.
Miss Lucile Caves of the Labor Bu
reau addressed the meeting most in
terestingly on the work of the bureau
on behalf of women and children, com

members most sympathetic listeners.

lution of such a problem.
If the sole object of each body is to
see that the measure goes through at
Sacramento, and to beholdc<yie statues

The Pioneer Daughters, on hearing
the collision of petitions, laid the mat
ter on the table, preferring to Join 1s

working amicably along that line.

almost powerless LEAPED frequency after
first treatment in public hall. Numerous
similar cases.
"MILLS OF THE GODS" grind "slowly";
Humanized Radium grinds diseases quickly.
often "Instantly."
"LATEST MARVEL" (last Thursday):
"Through a fall ona of my spinal bones was
displaced. PROTRUDING outward. It felt
loose, slipped about under my hand; trying
to stoop caused severe pain. After 2 treat-
ments by Rexradlo the bone went back to it*
place;, the splna is now LEVEL to the eye
and touch."
"AGONIZING PAIN" for years (GASTRITIS):
"Doctors said I must die. Last Friday first
treatment instantly removed all pains."
"ETERNAL SILENCE" broken; several
DEAF MUTES have recently HEARD and
Intelligibly SPOKEN words spoken to them
in ordinary voice and WHISPER not only by
Rexradio. but also by numerous persons In
his "public" audiences, whose signatures as
WITNESSES are attached to the testimo-
nials. Each treatment occupied 3 seconds j
only. Patient's eyes were always "closed" I
during speaking tests to prevent his "read- I
Ing" speaker's lips and "guessing" what was
spoken.
"ANOTHER WONDER"â Last Thursday AN-
OTHER DEAF MUTE after 3 seconds-
treatment HEARD and SPOKE what was
said to her under TEST conditions same as
above.
"LIGHT DAWNS" for . BLIND man: "My
eyes for years barely knew light from dark-
ness-. After Rexradio's one treatment I saw
the form of his uplifted hand, and the light
. between his fingers when separated. I looked
out of window, and at 30 feet distinguished
forms cf human beings, carriages, etc. All
this impossible before." Note â He saw the
outline*; further treatments may restore his

â¢Â¦REXRADIO'S" one treatment opened my
long CATARRH-clcsed nostrils and I
breathed freely."
"FUNERAL MARCH" to the grave was the

long bedridden, OSSIFIED lady, recently vts-
Itert me; I found all her formerly solid Joints
frefly movable: she grasped and shook my
handâ before Impossible; I was wonderstruck
to see the great change."
"ATHLETICS" â Rexradio instantly helped my
PARALYSIS." and I walked, ran, LEAPED."
"ALMOST MIRACLE"â Recently I took a
DEAF MUTE to Rexradio: in 3 seconds he
made her HEAR 4 and SPEAK numerous
words and sentences, which we all under-
stood clearly. She also spoke for me. If was
almost a MIRACLE."â J. P.. 3460 20th st.

Rexradlo was treating a patient, a rheu-
matic person sat within 4 feet, who de-
clared she felt the power pass to her and re.
move her pains. (A "frequent" occurrence.)
"STORED RADIUM" â Kexradlo charged a
handkerchief with his healing force, which

214 Eddy st. Tel. South 676.Henry Waddington's greyhound Torn
King came out of the Southland and
â¢Ji-feated the pick of the coursers of
ihe West in the J3D00 John Grace cup
Make yesterday at Uniyi Park- The
tp<Â»rt throughout the day was of the
M-r.sational order, as the hares were a
i-trong lot. Speed, stamina and game- j
â¢..â¢-.ss were required to carry a dog j
Lhrooffh the desperate running. A large |
attendance witnessed the day's sport.
The deciding , course was between j
Tom Kii^ and MeVey, and the brace of j
Ereybotxnds ran for one minute and 1
Jifty seconds before the red flag sig- j
raling that Tom King was the winner
v as displayed by the Hag steward.
McVÂ«y was the first to show in front
af:er "they left the hands of Slipper
Jim Grace. After they had traveled
one hundred yards Tom King drew
level and then showed slightly in front.
The hare bent down the field slightly
and McVey secured the first turn by
favor. He also made the second and
third and then placed Tom King. The
latter quickly ran up a commanding
sequence, performing in a determined
manner. McVey seemed to tire badly j
at this stage of the trial, but carqe i
.again strongly at the finish, when he
outgamed Tom King. The latter had
f>o great a lead to be overcome, how
ever, and was declared the winner by
a score of 16 to 7-
The spectators cheered both winner
and loser as they came off the field
after their gallant struggle.
Jack Dennis* The Referee showed
great speed early in the day, leading
Charter Member and also Quita, the
latter by six lengths. He then took
matters easily and was beaten.
Grafter, the Montana flyer, beat the
stake favorite, Valley Pride, in the sec
ond round. During the trial he collided
with the dog-catcher's horse and in
jured his leg, so that he had to be
withdrawn. fj 'Â«*Â¦*
That the public dearly loves a tried
and true champion was demonstrated
when Sacramento Boy won the conso
lation number. The old dog has two
cup victories to his credit. If his speed
was as keon as his heart Is stout the
younger dogs would have had a hard
time beating him In the big event.
The pur.=e stake was won by Agile
Spurt, from the kennel of G- La # cy
Crawford.
The dogs ran true to form through
out the day, there being but few up
sets. The results in detail, with Judge
P. J. Reilly'is official scores, follow:

The members of the Olympic Athletic
Club held their last cross-country walk
of the season yesterday, and, as usual
with them, had an enjoyable time. They
went to Ingleside in two special cars
and then made their way across the
reservation of the Spring Valley Water
Company. After reaching the beach
the athletes donned bathing suits and
dashed into the breakers. This whetted
their appetites for an elaborate lunch
eon, prepared by the veteran clubman
Jim Logan, and by Messrs. Hammer
smith, Benedict and Moore. The chow
der was pronounced a treat.
President Harrison was in his element
during the long walk and set a smart
pace' for the younger members. Those
in attendance were:

wicks at association football yester
day on the grounds at Ninth and Bryant
streets by a score of 5 to 0. Although
the score would make it appear that
the game was somewhat one-sided, it
was closely contested and the interest

good condition. Tufts of grasa and
weeds repeatedly deflected the ball
and interfered with the players. While

The blue and sold will have a much
better start next year than this in hav
ing a nucleus composed of experienced
men. This year's defeat will also have
a salutary effect on the general stu
dent body in creating a sentiment that
a victory must be Secured next season at
any cost. Coach Hopper has demon
strated that he is a gridiron alchemist
and if he and Greisberg are retained
next year, as they should be, the
chances are that with the working ma

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 13.
There wasnever a happier collection of
youthful humanity than the student
body of this institution is to-day. The
great victory over California was not
unexpected, but the . achievement is
none the less glorious on thai, account.
It marked the successful culmination of
moths of arduous labor on the part of
coaches and players, and was therefore
well deserved.
The football squad spent Saturday
night at the St. Francis Hotel In San
Francisco, and returned to the univer
sity at noon to-day. The team is. of
course, exuberant over its feat. The
men have two post-season games and
cannot yet break training. It is hoped
they will keep in trim to win these
contests and close the football year
with the luster of their achievements
undimmed.
BERKELEY, Nov. 13.â The members
of the varsity football team spent the
day after their defeat at the hands of
the cardinal in their homes and frater
nity houses, nursing their wounds and
trying to "forget it." Not one of them
was Berlously injured by the' mauling
which Stanford's giants administered to
them, but there were sore places
a-plenty for Berkeley men to salve,
and the day was principally given over
to this work.
Prentiss D. Gray, left guard of the
team, went into the game with a broken
rib. but despite the rough handling he
received and the fact that he was taken
out of the game in the second half,
Gray's injured member was not serious
ly impaired nor made worse.
Captain Stroud smashed while on the
line until flesh and blood could stand
the pressure no longer, lie showed the
effect of the pounding In a bruised and
blackened body, but of lasting hurts
there will be none in his case, nor in
that of Stern, Force or Heitmuller.
* There Is to "be a reorganization of the
men on the campus to-morrow after
noon. Those who -wish to play in post
season games will go into light train-
Ing.
It was the greatest gridiron battle
in the history of Western football.
Neither team ever played as rapidly
before nor was so much attention paid
to the fine points of the game. There
is still a chance for greater speed and
this will probably be the principal ob
ject of next year's coaching.
The wonder grows that two such or
ganizations should be turned out by
the rival colleges in the same year.
Stanford furnished an example of
almost ideal team work. The cardinal
eleven was not an aggregation of stars,
but a perfect working machine. The
game showed that while- Stott is not
individually the equal of Bansbach at
quarter, he increases the effectiveness
of the eleven by giving It additional
speed and cohesion. The cardinal
will lose several of her best men this
year, but that is' not in any way in
dicative that Lanagan cannot turn out
a better team r vear now that real
football is known west of the prairies.
The megaphones, the pennants and
the ribbons have all been locked away,
but the great football game between
Stanford and California is still being
fought over by the partisans. It is
conceded by every one who saw the
contest that the cardinal was justly
entitled to its victory. California has
a splendid eleven but Stanford had
its master. There is disappointment
over the result at the State University,
but the blue and gold cohorts are not
allowing the dust of defeat to choke
them.
Authorities Praise the Ma
chine-Like Team Work of
the Eleven From Stanford
FOOTBALL GAME
IS DISCUSSED
There is nothing like starting off
right, and as the major portion of the
speculators at Oakland track on Satur
day came away with the money they
will cross the bay this afternoon pre
pared to give the bookmakers another
pleasant time. The fields are not heavy,
and H looks as if four or five favorites
might win. Still that unseen percent
age that is unfathomable may come to
the relief of the ring.
Quite a number of old footlight favor
ites will start, among the number being
Albula and Matt Hogan. The two-year
old events look the most open and
should furnish excellent betting propo
sitions. â¢
More than likely the public will have
an opportunity to judge of the merits
of Jockey W. Davis. The youngster
was taken to the New York tracks from
St. Louis an unknown quantity, and in
an incredibly short space of time be
came the reigning sensation, almost de
throning Hildebrand as a public idol.
He comes to California under contract
to ride for "Walter Jennings and was
due to arrive at Oakland last evening.
It's pretty late in the season for a cel
lar ball team to take on a sudden burst
of speed, but the Seals probably labor
under the Impression that it is better
late than never* They faced the warring
hosts from the village of Seattle twice
yesterday, and twice these tossers of
the north came in just a run behind.
At paklanrl it was 4 to 3, and at Recre
ation Park the finish was 1 to 0.
Joe Corbett and Dick Williams mixed
in the second great slab fight of the
week yesterday afternoon. Corbett was
far and away the best, for he won. A
scratch hit beat the former hero of 1
many a blue and gold struggle. Just;
one little run in the second inning set
tled the entire contestâ a hard one for
any pitcher to lose. ':'-.'Â¦;.
It was old Wooden Shoes Andy who
ushered the round in for the Seals after
two were dead. He landed on a skimpy
hit to third, which Delehanty could not
handle in time. Wheeler soused a good
one out to center and started the fans
yelling. They kept on with that yell,
for Wilson was there with another one
â nearly to the same spot. Andy hot
footed and landed at the pan a second
before the ball. That was the tale of
the only run of a great game of ball.
The only time the Seals were in dan
ger of breaking it irp was in the sev
enth inning, when Corbett lost the plate
and walked Frisk. Smith and Freeman
in a row. Russ Hall was the man to
rely on for something, but the best he
had was a foul, which Captain Irwin
devoured, and the calamity was thus
averted.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
Angels took both games from Port
land to-day. Both games were played
in" the afternoon and the first was the
easiest sort of victory for the locals.
The only enlivening features were an
exchange of compliments between
Flood and the umpire, for which
Flood was put out of the game, and a
home run by Cravath over the left
field fence. Jones pitched a strong
game.
In the second game Simons was put
in to pitch and in the first inning the
Angels scored enough runs to win the
game. Mason, for the locals, was wild,
but kept the hits well enough scat
tered to save the game. Score:

Kopta Quartet's Concert.
The . Tschaikowsky piano trio, op.
50. was the^novelty of yesterday aft
ernoon's Kopta quartet concert at
Lyric Hall. The trio, "dedicated to
the memory of a great artist," Rubin
stein, was given for the first time here,
and developed/ as a work, of excep
tional beauty. It was played admir
ably throughout by Mr. Kopta, Mr.
L-ada and Mrs. Oscar Mansfeldt. An
other number- of much interest was
the two Dvorak waltzes, of. which the
manuscript is in possession of only
three quartet organizations, the Knei
sel and Kopta quartets among: them.
They proved, beautifully played, the
most popular work of the afternoon,
being:, enthusiastically Â¦ e,ncored. The
Beethoven . Quartet, op.- 18, opened
the programme, and was rendered in
sympathetic and graceful fashion.
The next programme : of the series
will be given Sunday afternoon, De
cember 11, and will have for its chief
feature a new piano quintet of Aren
sky's, that will then be played for the

prestige in the memorable Blaine cam
paign. The incorporation of the league
as a social club did not tfcke place until
1SS3. The club in its onward march to
its present comfortable position has
seen some dark days of adversity. On
more than one occasion the outlook wa3
decidedly gloomy. Republican leaders
who had been honored by the party and
to some degree enriched by the emolu
ments of office gave the club no sup
port and spoke sneeringly of the loyal
and true members as "chair warmers."
Others took offense because the man
agement insisted on the payment of
just obligations and resigned without
liquidating the debt. The stalwart rep
resentatives of the league were not dis
heartened by the conduct of the delin
quents, but applied themselves to the
task of recruiting new members in the
city and extending the benefits of the
institution to Republicans of the inte
rior.
The hospitalities of the Union League
have been extended to many eminent
men of the United States. Presidents
Harrison, McKinley and Roosevelt have
been honored guests of the league.
The apartments in the Palace Hotel oc
cupied by the league for so many years
did not afford sufficient space for the
increasing membership, hence a propo
sition was advanced during Colonel
George H. Pippy's first term as presi
dent for the purchase of a site and the
building of a house on Stockton street,
between Post and Geary street3. After
a full investigation the project was
abandoned on account of the magni
tude of the financial requirements.
"When the Pacific-Union Club resolved
to build a new home Mr. Burbank.
owner of the house which this club
was about to vacate, entered into nego
tiations with the Union League, and
the result was a long lease of the prem
ises by the league. It was ascertained
that the sum of $20,000 would be re
<ruired to provide new furniture and
equipment. That sum was immediately
set arart for such use as the directors
deemed advisable. The Union League
Is now on a plane of equality with oth
er prominent social clubs of San Fran
cisco, and there are Indications that the
city membership will be materially en
larged.
One new feature is a ladies' annex.
The Stockton street entrance to the
clubhouse will be used by ladies who
may be entitled to the privileges of the
annex. It is the purpose of the directors
to give club functions in which the
"wives, sisters and sweethearts" may
participate. Limited space in the old
quarters on New Montgomery street
was an obstacle to such functions.

Gottlieb Hopp. formerly a sergeant in
Company K of the Coast Artillery,
irsade complaint to the police yesterday
afternoon that he had been robbed of
52250 on Saturday night. Hopp was in
such a condition of intoxication that he
remained unconscious for seventeen
hours at the Central Emergency Hos
pital, and he is unable to give the de
tectives any clew to the thief.
Hopp was retired in Honolulu four
months ago. He says he had saved
the money that was stolen from him,
and that it represented the earnings
of thirty years' service. He says
he carried $2000 in greenbacks in an
inside vest pocket and $250 in gold coin
in his trousers. During the afternoon,
h* says, he left his room at 232 Hyde
street and went to the Presidio. Early
in the evening he returned to the city
in company with Samuel Amsler of the
Thirteenth Infantry and the pair vis
ited several saloons on O'Farrell street.
The last resort they went into was that
of Henry Frusteck, on the southwest
corner of O"Farrell and Stockton
streets. Frusteck says Hopp became
abusive and was thrown out. He
Â¦walked up O'Farrell street in com
pany with Amsler and when near his
horn* 3 became suddenly unconscious.
Amsler eays he placed the man in a
doorway for about ten minutes for the
purpose of learning where he lived and
that if he was robbed it was during this
time. Amsler was taken to the Central
Police Station and Questioned by De
tective Bailey, but Hopp refused to
allow any suspicion to be cast upon
him.

Precisely. It is Miss Glo3e's way of do
ing the things that is the point. Her
baby girl is a real baby girl singing
about a rag doll; nqt one of those won
derful pickled infants that tempt tAjthe
sympathetic brickbat. We've air seen
her girls that walk, amble and sidle
"like this," and her French chanson is
of the rarest of delicate deviltry.
About her singing, as Miss Glose her
se'lf wittily preludes, she "talks" her
songs, but with much vocal agreeable
ness and with the refinement that de
lights and refreshes throughout her
work. She plays, tooâ accompanies her
self in a fashion that shows the accom
plished pianist. Altogether Miss Glose
counts up "class," chic, a rare comedy
vein and a delicate and unusual beauty
among her equipment. By next week
the young woman will have learned to
wait for the numerous laughs that fall
to her share, and also to get rid of a
certain breathlessness in the tempo of
her work.
After, it is the, clan Murphy, not to
speak of Kelly, that howlds down most
of the Orpheum boards. The Murphys.
however, are new this week, Mr. and
Mrs. Mark Murphy, who bring an en
gaging sketch entitled "Why Doogan
Swore Off." A rollicking, jovial, whole
hearted Irish pair â who would evident
ly "rather be micks than kings" â are
the Murphys. By a process as delicate
ly logical as bludgeoning a hint into a
burglar, the lady in the sketch makes
her unsober spouse believe that he has
murdered a Chinaman. He has come
.home in a wheelbarrow. He went out
the night before to a fire. He becomes
convinced of sin under his wife's tactics
and abjectly repents. She then extracts
a promise from him never, never more
to. etc. Then she tells him he is guilt
less of Ah Lung's death. An uproarious
curtain falls upon Doogan, firmly en
sconsed in the wheelbarrow demanding
to i e returned to the unfinished festivi
ties. Mrs. Murphy as Joolia has to sing,
and is good fun to listen to, and both
are clever low comedians.
For the rest, there is a mind-reading
pony of the Carlisle dog and pony
troupe that is very clever. Then John
T. Kelly in his "Senator McPhee" helps
the Irish to beat the Dutch again tHfe
week, and it is what our sporting editor
would call a "knockout." The Ramon
niers, acrobats, do a "little sensational
trapeze work, and Canfield and Carle
ton and Jeanie Fletcher continue.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Â» * *
"The Fatal Wedding" began a
week's run at the Grand Opera-house
last evening with a good audience.
The play is a touching story of a plot
ting woman, the separating of a hus
band and wife and the final happy
ending of the action.
"A Friend of the Family" furnished
the usual big Sunday night house at
the California Theater with an over
abundance of laughter last night. The
comedy is well known in this city, but
whenever it comes it is sure to be wel
comed. It v was as well received as
ever last night and made a hit that
was genuine. The piece abounds in
all manner of funny happenings, being
founded on a domestic row, in which
all the members of the family and
plenty of outsiders are strangely
tangled up.
William Friend, the well-known
comedian, who plays the part of the
abused husband, was at his best last
night. He is a genuine funmaker and
can adapt himself to a difficult role
with the greatest ease. Â¦ Harry Cran
dall, as th<f minister who toyed with
the flowing bowl, is much of the
show. His acting is worth going miles
to see. Miss Thais Magrane, the lead
ing lady, gave a good account of her-
Velf, as did Mies Dudley in the role
of the domineering aunt and Eugene
Redding as the fiery French Count.
The principal characters were well
supported by the other members of
the company and the play runs very
smoothly in every comical detail.
The managers of the California
Theater are having trouble about
booking- '"The Runaways." the show
to be put on next week. Last night
Frank O. Miller, owner of the show,
informed the managers of the house
that he would take his attraction off
if they did not sell the seats on the
$150 basis. He claimed that as the
price his show played to throughout
tho East and demanded it here. Man
ager Ackerman informed Miller that
the regular price for the best seat at
the 1 California was 51 and that. he
would not raise the prices for any
owner. Miller and Ackerman all but
came to blows over the affair. Miller
says he will sue the California man
agement in the courts arid take his
show off their list; .
The Union League Clutrof San Fran
cisco, which was incorporated July 18,
1SS9, is now, with a membership of
nearly one thousand, comfortably and
luxuriously established in its new
hotn.e, corner of Post and Stockton
streets. The south frontage on Post
street affords an unsurpassed view.
The spacious house was for many
years occupied by the Pacific-Union
Club, and there are many who regard
it as the ideal club site of San Fran
cisco. >V^
The league was instituted to support
and Inculcate the principles of the Re
publican party; to promote loyalty to
the Government; to further and by
social, moral and political influences
assist in advancing the cause of good
government and the honest and pa
triotic administration thereof.
