"WASHINGTON, July 22. â Heirs of
Louis Etzel, killed- by Chinese soldiers
near Newchwang, are dissatisfied with
the amount of indemnity ($25,000 Mex

on account of the affair and have com
plained to the State Department. The
department has replied that, in view
of the facts, the unpremeditated char
acter of the killing and the general
practice of the American and other
Governments in fixing Indemnities on
account of death, tha indemnity in this
case Is regarded as sufficient. The
promptness of the Chinese Government

The differences between Beck and the
head of, the banking institution date
back more than six months, during
which time it is said that much corre
spondence has been indulged in be
tween manager and president relative
to the amount of money that should
be paid to the former in consideration
of his resignation. Beck is reported to
have refused to compromise, and some
time ago he engaged Attorney William
II. Metson to represent him in the mat
ter. Later Judge Henshaw became in
terested in the case, as a sort of me
diator, and now that Wightman has
arrived here it is expected that the dif
ferences between Beck and the presi
dent of the company will be amicably
adjusted.
It was reported yesterday that the
Russo-Chinese Bank, through one of its
local representatives, had been nego
tiating with Beck for his services. This
fact is said to have brought forth a
suggestion from the International
Banking Corporation that Beck could
well afford to compromise with the lat
ter institution, as he would probably
sufier no financial loss. As the matter
now stands the retirement of Manager
Beck iests entirely on the question as
to whether the International Banking
Corporation will pay the full amount
due him for two years' service, under
an existing contract, or whether he will
finally agree to accept less.
Just what brought about a diagree
ment between Manager Beck and the
higher officials of the bank is not
known. The fact that a breach exists
between him and the president, how
ever, Is a. subject that has been quietly
discussed in banking circles -since
Wightman's arrival here two days ago.
Apparently the original information re
garding the trouble came direct from
New York, for several prominent bank
ing men of this^city appear to be.ver>
well informed on the matter/ although
they are not willing to discuss it for
publication.
Manager Beck is regarded as one of
the best bank exchange experts In this
city. It was this reputation, gained
during his many years' connection with
the Anglo-Californian Bank, that was
materially responsible for his appoint
ment-to his present position with the
International Banking Corporation.
Every possible effort is being made to
keep the' matter of. his retirement a
secret, and no one- connected with the
affair will consent to discuss it.
The amount is said to be $30,000 and
the officials of the company are be
lieved to be dickering with the local
manager with a view of having him
agree to a compromise on a much lower
figure. â¢
The arrival here from New York of
William B. Wlghtman, assistant to
the president of the International
Banking Corporation, has been quickly
followed by a report that Colonel Fran
cis C. Beck, local manager of the in
stitution, is soon, to retire.
Although Wightman, who is staying
at the St." Francis Hotel, 1 defines to re
ceive newspaper representatives or'an
swer any inquiries over the phone rela
tive to the report of Manager Beck's
retirement, it is generally understood
that the assistant to the president of
the big banking institution is here to
deal with the local manager regarding
his resignation.
According to information gleaned
from reliable sources Beck has declined
to resign unless the full amount of his
salary for two years, the period in
which he has contracted to serve the
company. Is paid to him.

had to withstand a siege till help came
from the stockyards police station, a
considerable distance.
Other men were severely beaten by
strikers.
SERIOUS RIOTING BEGINS.
"The packers signed an agreement
that there would be no discrimination
In the rehiring of the men. This was
accepted by the officers of the organiza
tion in good faith. On the return of
the men this morning they were lined
up like cattle. The foreman, walking
through the line, would pick out a man
and say, 'You come up.' The next man
would be pushed out of line and told
that he could not be used, and It was
always the good, active union men
whom they could not use.
"Superintendent Pension of the Ar
mour canning department - addressed
the employes in the following language
this morning: 'You went away like cat
tle, and we will take you back like cat
tle.' This language was used both to
men and women."
GENERAL STRIKE PROBABLE.
Unless a settlement be reached to
morrow the general belief is that a
sympathetic strike of the allied trades
in the packing Industry, which was
threatened last week to enforce the de
mands of the strikers, will be called.
All these unions .have signified their
willingness to stand by the butchers if
they are called upon to assist in the
struggle with the packers for su
premacy.
In a statement given out to-night
President Donnelly of the Butchers*
Union says:
At to-day's conference, which lasted
five hours, a committee, consisting of
rive representatives of the packers and
live representatives of the â¢ Butchers'
Union, was appointed to go over the
v, .-...â¢- situation, but it was unable to
reach a working basis with which both
Bides would be satisfied. Whether the
difficulty can be satisfactorily settled
at to-morrow's meeting is problemat
ical, as each side maintains that it is
living up to Wednesday's agreement
lor a settlement by arbitration and that
it is the other side that is responsible
for the renewal of hostilities.
CHICAGO, July 22.â The stockyards
strike, which Â¦was renewed this morn
ing in Chicago and all the other points
where the big packing companies have
branches because the strikers were dis
eatisSed with the manner In which the
employers proposed to reinstate former
employes pending a settlement by ar
bitration, will continue for another day
et least. A joint conference between the
representatives cf both sides of the con
troversy and representatives of the al
lied trades in an attempt to bring about
a peaceable adjustment of this second
Ftrike was unsuccessful, and the meet

GENERAL KUROKI'S HEAD
QUARTERS, Wednesday. July 20.â
The Japanese attack upon the Russians
at Kiaotung yesterday resulted in an
other Russian disaster. Kiaotuns 13
twenty-five miles from these headquar
ters. Few details of the engagement
have been received, but they indicate
that the fighting was fierce. The Rus
sians had more than one divRlon en
gaged and artillery was used freely.
The Russians are fortifying new posi
tions before Motien Pass.
â¢ More Russians were killed in the
fighting of Sunday,- July 17, than can
be buried and the Japanese are now
engaged in cremating the bodies.
â¢ TOKIO. July 22.â General Kuroki,
after a severe fight, occupied Kiaotung
on July 19. The place had been fortified
by the Russians, who defended it
stoutly. In the fighting General Ku
roki's troops drove the Russians from
their strongly fortified position on the
Chi River, which is northwest of Mo
tien Pass and east of Anping, inflict
ing upon the enemy more serious losses
than the Japanese sustained. The flght
began on the 18th and ended on the
19th. The Japanese lost 424 men in
killed and wounded. The Russian losses
are estimated at 1000.
RUSSIANS TURN SUDDENLY.
General Kuroki began his advance
early in the morning of the 18th. He
uncovered and followed the enemy
along the Chi River. The Russians
seemed to" be retiring to the northward,
when suddenly two battalions, with
eight guns, turned and attacked the
Japanese vanguard vigorously. At this
point the Japanese suffered before re
lief came, one company losing all its
officers.
At a late hour in the afternoon the
Russians' position was developed. They
occupied en eminence on the banks of
the Chi. This river guarded their left
flank and high precipices protected the
Russians on the right. The only ap
proach to their position was through a
narrow defile. â¢
The fighting continued until dark,
when the Japanese forces bivouacked.
The Russians made two counter at
tacks, but were repulsed in each case.
The Japanese renewed the attack at
midnight, posting tLeir artillery in the
valley below and on the high ground
to the south of the Russian position.
The main Japanese body was assigned
to attack the Russian center; a small
detachment was sent toward the right
flank and another to watch the enemy'3
left flank. After these positions had
been taken, the fighting ceased for* a
time, but it was resumed at dawn.
RETREAT BECOMES A ROUT.
The Russians had thirty-two guns
in action, and they vigorously shelled
the Japanese. To this flre the Japanese
replied, and the bombardment lasted
four hours. During this time the Jap
anese infantry moved forward and the
flankers had succeeded in scaling the
heights on the Russian right by 3
o'clock in the afternoon, at which hour
the main force was ordered to storm the
Russian center. The Japanese artil
lery protected this movement splendid
ly, but the infantry met with a severe
flre and lost heavily in gaining the
heights.
The final successful charge was de
livered at 5:30 in the . afternoon. The
Japanese succeeded in partially cut r
ting off the Russian retreat* and this
soon became a rout. The enemy re
tired in two directions, to the north
ward and to the eastward.
The Russian forces engaged included,
in addition to the artillery, seven bat
talions of infantry and a regiment of
Cossacks. The enemy left 131 dead and
300 rifles on the field. Prisoners taken
estimate the Russian losses at 1000.
The Japanese lost one officer and fifty
four men killed and eighteen officers
and 351 men wounded.
On July 19 Japanese forces attacked
a battalion of infantry and 1000 cavalry
that occupied Chechiato, to the north
ward of Shaotientzu. After four hours
of fighting the Russians retired across
the Taitsu River.- In this engagement
the Japanese had seventen men
wounded.

the plants, was attacked by nearly 1000
beys, and girls while she was on her
way home. She was chased for several
blocks and pelted with mud and stones.
When she reached home she fell in a
heap on the doorstep, exhausted from
fright and bruises.
The girl was dragged into the house
by her father before the pursuing
crowd could reach her. Seeing that she
had escaped them, they commenced to
batter the house with stones and
bricks. A riot call was sent in and it
took a wagonload of police to disperse
the rioters.
Late to-night It was learned that the
obstacle which prevented a settlement
of the strike at to-day's conference was
the fact that the strikers had made
new demands on the packers. Donnelly
demanded that all the strikers be re
instated within ten days, instead of
forty-five days, as provided in the
original agreement.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 23, 2:05 a.
m.â The Bteamship Malacca is at SuÂ«la
Bay, Island of Crete, where, under thv
agreement reached between Great
Britain and Russia, she will be per
functorily inspected jointly by the
Consuls of the two countries and re
leased, unless palpable contraband of
war Intended for the Japanese shall be
found, in which case the contraband
only will 'be held. British Government
stores aboard the vessel will not be
examined.
From the first, Russian authorities
were convinced that the captain of the
Russian volunteer fleet steamship St.
Petersburg must have had good reason
for seizing the Malacca as a -prize,- and
his report, stating that the skipper of
the Malacca declined to produce the
ship's manifest, seems to have justi
fied their confidence.
There is reason to believe that had
the fact been known in advance thai
the Malacca's skipper took upon him
self the responsibility of questioning
the war status of the St. Petersburg
and defied the Russian war flag, con
trary to international law, which evi
dently came as a complete surprise to
the British Government, that nation
might not have acted as it did.
In spite of this development, how
ever, Russia adopted a most concil
iatory attitude. The Czar himself was
desirous of avoiding the slightest pre
text for a quarrel and personally gave
orders to settle the matter promptly.
According to a high authority, Rus
sia has conveyed assurances that there
would be no repetitions of the Red Sea
incidents.
KANSAS CITY 3IEN OUT.
Strikers Claim They Were Being Dis
criminated Against.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. July 22.âPresi
dent Donnelly's order to the packing
house employes to renew the strike
came as a surprise to both the pack
ers and the men. Although practically
ail of the several thousand men who
went out originally appeared at the dif
ferent plants here ready for work, each
company employed only a sufficient
number of strikers to make up a com
plete force. All the plants were soon
supplied in all departments and ap
parently running in full blast. Prac
tically all of the strike breakers were
retained. C. W. Armour said:
"I cannot understand the cause for
Mr. Donnelly's new order. I consider
that these men have broken faith with
the packers. It would be impossible
for the packers here or anywhere in
the country to take all of the strikers
back at once. There is not sufficient
work for them to do. All the plants
are more or less disorganized, and it
will be some time before they will be
in shape to operate full forces in all de
partments. One reason why all could
not be taken back immediately is that
there is not sufficient livestock on the
market."
A crowd pathered at the Toll box
factory, a non-union plant which does
work for Swift & Co.. and, when it be
came threatening, was dispersed by the
police.
Many of the strikers assert that the
different packers showed deliberate
di*crimiration- in re-employing those
of their number who were put at work
to-day.
"I have worked at Swift's ten years."
said a hog butcher. "To-day I was told
I was not needed, and another man who
had been there only a day was hired.
I am only one of the many."
In some cases, it is asserted, the older
men were told they would never be
hired. In no case was an official of the
union taken back.
At the stock yards a fair proportion
of the days receipts had been sold
when the order to strike came. Im
mediately most of the buyers in both
the cattle and hog yards quit oper
ations and refused to buy the stock
on which bids had been submitted.
The renewal of the strike caused a
flurry among dealers. They had hoped
to lower prices to the former standard
to-day, but now higher prices for meat
of all kinds will soon prevail.
GREAT ISSUE UNDECIDED.
Yet to Be Determined.
Status of Volunteer Fleet Steamships
LONDON. July 23.â The morning pa
pers generally express satisfaction that
the Malacca incident has been settled
In accordance with the demands of
Great Britain, though there, is an in
clination to await the settlement of the
broader question of the passage through
the Dardanelles of the volunteer fleet
steamships before believing that all
danger has been averted. This feeling
is heightened by Premier Balfour^s an
nouncement on the adjournment of the
House of Commons that he still had no
official news to pommunicate, either in
connection with the Malacca incident
or with the volunteer fleet steamships
in general.
The Daily Telegraph says that its
alarmist editorial of July- 22 was writ
ten with "full knowledge that the Rus
sian Government would act as it has
done, and the object in so writing waÂ»
to point out that, the Malacca incident
was only a factor in' the great problem",
which has not been settled."
The paper confirms the statement
that the Czar was urged by the French
Government to settle the case of the
Malacca.^ and this settlement it at
tributes to the French action, saying:
| "Jt is rumored in diplomatic circles
that Germany, wishes to co-operate
with Great Britain, in .the settlement of
Â¦the main feature of the dispute."
It urgently T>6ints out to the Govern
ment that -iioiHriar-.- opinion- in Great
Britain. Â¦jvould not admit such partner?
shfp.Vand adds _an, interesting detail to
.the 'heatT-of. the- controversy, of the last
few days- by positively stating . that if
the Malacca: had approached the Dar*
danelles "she- would- have been" sum
moned to surrender -by our gunboat
waiting there, and. if she had not com
plied she would have been "fired upon."
The Times draws attention to serious
complications of a similar kind which
are liable to occur in the Pacific, in T
stancing the Pacific Mall . Steamship
Company's apprehensions on this point.
The marine insurance article. of the
Times says that greater anxiety-exist
ed in London yesterday over cargoes
for the China and Japan seas than
over those by, way of the Red Sea, espe
cially with regard to the American
steamship Shawmut.
"It is most' important," the . article
says, "that the Americans and our^
selves should strongly object to any
attempt to treat provlsibns destined for
ordinary civilian consumption as icon
traband of war." -

Donnelly of the Butchers' and Meat

PORTLAND, Or., July 22. â With a
cargo of 50,000. barrels. of Oregon flour
the steamship Aragonia of the Portland
and Asiatic Line will attempt to run
the gauntlet of Russian cruisers off the
Japanese coast and land her contra
band of war at a Japanese port. This
was decided upon to-day in an agree
ment between General Manager
Schwerin of the Portland and Asiatic
Company and the Hamburg-American
Line, the owners of the vessel.
The German owners were at first very
much adverse to \he loading of their
vessel at this port, with the prospect
of seizure by the Russians before ar
riving at her Oriental destination.
Captain Schuldt, master of the Ara
gonia, filed a protest at the owners'
request. Manager Schwerin came back
with the statement that as the bulk of
the proposed cargo for the Aragonia
was Hour, she would have to take the
barrels or make the trip light.
After some discussion the Portland
and Asiatic Company agreed to file a
bond indemnifying the Hamburg-
American Line in the event that the
steamship is captured by the Czar's
war vessels lying in wait off the Jap

As the Pacific Mail is a large carrier
of foodstuffs the following rule of war,
contained in the proclamation of the
Czar, was the one upon which the com?
pany sought a ruling:
"According to rule 6 the following
will be regarded as contraband of
war: â¢ * â¢ also rice, foodstuffs, etc.
Neutral ships with contraband of 'war
of any sort can, according to circum
stances, not only, be seized, but also
can be confiscated." . > Â¦
This Government, however, was not
willing to lay out a plan of operations
for the White Squadron based upon
contingency and the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company was Informed that
the Government would not attempt to
place a construction upon the war rules
of the Czar until a specific case of
seizure of an American vessel made
such construction necessary. Notwith
standing this fact, the Mall company
will continue' to ship flour and food
stuffs from this port to the Orient.*
At the' offices of the Mail company
yesterday it was stated that, although
its vessels were carriers of large quan
tities of flour and other foodstuffs to
Japanese and other Oriental ports, the
same were shippeji by neutral firms and
consigned to neutral merchants. The
company's ships are carrying no con
signments to either of the belligerents,
nor are they carrying ammunition of
any kind to any one, the passenger
licenses prohibiting such shipments.
Consequently the officers of the com
pany, feel that In event of the seizure
of any of its vessels they would be able
to secure its release without difficulty.
So sure of this are' they that no war
insurance is carried covering the comf
pany's vessels that ply between here
and the Orient. ' ;
Somewhere out on the broad Pacific
the Vladivostok squadron sails, a men
ace to the commerce of the world. Here
in San Francisco the greatest interest
centers in the movements of the evasive
Slav fleet. From here the trans-Pacific
steamships start on. their voyages ; to.
the Orient with their neutral cargoes
destined to neutral ports and with their
cargoes of contraband billed to the bel
ligerents. Millions of American money
are invested In these ships and cargoes

rage induced by drink, her appetite for
which she could not control, Mrs. Ran
neb, wife of J. Will Ranneb, a Los An
geles attorney, fired three shots at her
husband Wednesday night at Norwalk,
this county, and then turned the
weapon upon herself, inflicting a wound
from which she died to-night The
couple were married a year ago. Soon
after the marriage the husband dis
covered tha^his wife had acquired an
ungovernable appetite for drink. He
took her to the McCarthy ranch near
Norwalk, in a remote section of the
county, hoping by absenting her from
places where liquor is sold to be able
to cure her. All went well for a time,
but > the Woman found the means of
securing liquor and this led to frequent
quarrels.
Wednesday night Ranneb returned
and found that his wife had been
drinking. A quarrel of more than or
dinary violence followed and during it
the woman seized a revolver and be
gan shooting at her husband. Her
condition w r as such that her aim was
not good and he escaped Injury. She
fired four shots at him, all of which
went wild. Her failure to effectively
use the weapon seemed to anger her
the more and turning the revolver on
herself she sent the last bullet into
her left breast above the heart. Had
she . recovered the public probably
would never have known of the shoot
ing, but her death to-night rendered it
necessary for the physicians who at
tended her to notify the Coroner. The
husband is' almost, crazed over the
death of his wife. He is a son of S. D.

even the most conservative of the
creditors described the failure as "rot

firm were over $1,250,000: its assets were
practically nothing. The outside hold
ings of ranches and stores were heavily
mortgaged to various banks, and the
warehouses supposed to be full of grain
contained little but sweepings. The
matter was brought to the attention of
the Grand Jury, and after an investi
gation Jacob Eppinger and Herman
Eppinger were jointly indicted on
charges of obtaining- money under
false pretenses, the specific charge on
which the Indictment was based being
a transaction with the International
Banking Corporation on April 14, 1903.

Washington street was found late last
night lying unconsclc-us near the cor

She was taken to the Central Emer

blunt instrument,' probably a hammer.
There is little hope for her recovery.

working on that theory. The woman
regained consciousness long enough to
give her name and then relapsed Into a
state of coma, from which . she will
probably never recover. The surgeons
were attempting to trephine, her skull

ed at a wine exhibit will say the bev
erage given them is good, but when
a viticultural expert for a foreign coun
try that has its own wines in the mar
ket carefully tastes and then praises
with true enthusiasm it means some
thing. B. C. Cinncinnato da Costa of
Portugal, a member of the jury of
awards at Paris and also of the jury
for this exposition, has not only said
the California wines were of excellent
quality, but has expressed surprise at
their improvement during the last few
years and says their future, with the
still further improvement that is nat
ural, is a great one. Commissioner da
Cbsta's opinion should be worth some
thing, for he is a professor and' vice
president of the Technical Agricultural
Institute of Lisbon, of which the King
of Portugal is president; director of
the laboratory of fermentation of the
same institute; member of the Supe
rior Council of Agriculture and Science
of Coimba and director of the Royal
Central Agricultural Association of
Portugal. If all that doesn't make Da
Costa's opinion of wine valuable there
is small chance for any one's to have
weight.'; But if that isn't enough. It
might be well to say that he is the
author of two well-known volumes,
"The History of Viticulture of Portu
gal" and "The Technical History of
Agriculture #f Portugal."
"When 1 was at the Paris Fair," said
Professor ,da Costa, "I sampled the
California wines exhibited there and,
to be truthful, was not favorably im
pressed with them; they seemed to bo
woefully lacking. I remember sitting
down to dinner with California wines
on the table and there was more m
the bottles than myself and my friends
needed. '
"My surprise is great when I taste
these excellent v.'incs you exhibit now.
The Improvement in these few years Is
marvelous. You have wines that rank
with any in the world and all are good.
Tha present quality of California vin
tages and the still further improvement
that the advance in the last few years
promises 'assure a splendid future for
the grape and its product in Cali
fornia."
Professor da Costa has tanks of wine
at^ his disposal, so he didn't say all
this because he hoped to be given a
bottle with a pretty label to carry home
as a sample. It looks as" if , some gold
medals might come in the direction of
California's wine exhibit.
Haber's ability to speak several lan
guages is a valuable asset to him in
his position here, as'many of those In
terested in wines and grape culture are
foreigners.
FEAST UPON WATERMELONS.
Luscious Repast Enjoyed by Visitors
at the California Building.
ST. LOUIS, July 22.â A watermelon
feast was given to-night on the large
lawn at the rear of the California build-
Ing to California visitors and the pub
lic generally. A half carload of fine
watermelons had just been received
from California. The melons were
flavored with several kinds of Cali
fornia wine. The feast was attended by
many prominent Californians, who
pronounced it one of the pleasan test af
fairs that has yet graced the California
building, v.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILDING,
ST. LOUIS, July 22.â For wideawake,
active work at St. Louis there is prob
ably no section in California that is
excelling Sacramento. The advantages
of the great Sacramento Valley are
presented to the exposition visitors in
a manner that arouses interest from
the very start.
The scheme has been placed in the
hands of men who understand that
they have been sent to St. Louis to
accomplish a special purpose, and that
purpose is to convince the people that
the Sacramento Valley is the great
est producing section in the country.
To see is to believe, but it requires
hard effort to set the people thinking
in this line when they are 2000 miles
away. But this is what the Sacramento
Valley promoters are doing.
Oreat credit is due Colonel R. M.
Oreen. J. H., Willis and J. Reith Jr.,
the Commissioners who are so ably
representing the northern portion of
the State.
The representatives of Sacramento
City also are doing splendid work. The
work is under the direction of General
J. G. Martine, and he is assisted by
J. H. Devine and H. P. Rowley. The
headquarters are at the Hamilton
Hotel, although excellent missionary
work is being done at all the hotels.
Sacramento, Butte, Colusa, El
Dorado, Glenn, Placer, Shasta, Sutter.
Tehama, Yuba and Yolo counties are
embraced in the association. Good work
for each of them is being done by the
representatives here.
There is an Oakland merchant at the
I .ouiFiar.ii Purchase Exposition who
has learned something concerning 1 the
excellence of California wines that will
be of benefit to him. It does not look
reasonable that new customers for
California goods could be found among
Californiar.:; visiting: the fair, but un
fortunatoly there are denizens of the
Golden State who have the foreign label
mania â only excusable if the foreign
article is really betterâ as badly as the
people of the East.
The merchant in question, whose
name is veil known in California com
mercial circles, entered the wine dis
play of his native State in the Palace
of Agriculture and sampled some sau
terne, toward which variety of wine he
has a leaning:. Setting down his glass
he asked of Ferdinand Haber, who has
charge of the display:
"You tell me this is a California
wine?"
"Look at the label," said Haber. "We
wouldn't risk selling anything from the
European laboratories under our es
teemed label." and his chest puffed out.
The Oaklander saw that the bottle
bore the brand of a well-known Cali
fornia winery. Ho asked the price of
the vintage and was informed on that
point.
"Well. I never knew," he' said, "that
any sauterne as good as that was pro
duced in California. I've been for years
Ilsing an imported sauterne at my table
and this is actually better and cheaper.
I'll use it instead of the foreign article
hereafter." ' V^
Haber couldn't miss the chance for
an oration, and to the Oakland mer
chant and the rest of those present he
said:
"If Californians were like the French
and Germansâ loyal to their soilâ the
State would prosper more. The French
man and the German will not eat any
thing, wear anything or drink anything
not produced by the soil of their coun
try, provided their countries supply
them gdod articles. Let the Califor
nians recognize the merit of their own
wines, their own olives and their own
olive oils, and the producers will be
more prosperous." %
Haber was revived after this effort
with a dash of French cognac that was
handy.

AT WORLD'S EXPOSITION
At 11 o'clock no agreement had
been reached and as there seemed no
hope that a verdict would speedily be
found the Jury was locked up for the
night.
FAII/URE OF THE FIRM.
The firm of Eppinger & Co., consist-
Judge Lawlor's instructions to the
jury, while lengthy, were confined to
the laws iroverning embezzlement, and
after the Jury retired he ordered a re
tess until 8 o'clock.
WILL PROSECUTE ALL.
At this point I wish to give warnins that
rvery Person who has falsely testified on this
ftand Â»nd rvttry peno:i who bad any guilty
rf.nnwnion with these frauds will be pros
ecuted.
The defense has boa-ted that shipload affr
?Mplnad of wheat went to foreign ports. Jaxob
Hi-pinger knew that that wheat did not belong
to him. but to the Coluta Bank, and he
i-tol* It. On onÂ» lot of grain money was
borrowed three times, end it was afterward
U.lpped away and sold.
Where haÂ« this tnoii^y gone? Has It been
yurk away? It is net here to meet the
. bligatlons. Why were they afraid to admit
the books in court? An honest merchant does
not tear an inspection of his books.
Gentlemen of the Jury, do not let the man
who steals hundreds of thousands of dollars
PW free while the man who steals a farthine
tzoea to Jail. With the firm conviction that
:ou will do your duty I now leave the case
with you.
At 2 o'clock Byington took up the
argument for the prosecution and
Ftarted to tear to pieces the elaborate
i-txucture of the defense. He attempted
nu brilliant flights of oratory, dealing
â¢olcJy v.ith the evidence and the trans
actions of the firm prior to its failure.
He said in part:
It haÂ« been drilled into you by the defense
that Bernard Ettlinger was the jullty carty,
!..< cause on April 14. 10W, he signed more
â¢ hecks than Jacob Epptnger did. It is true
he <lid Fign taort checks on that day. but
Jh"ir aggregate Â«u lÂ«ut $2Â« 35. while Jacob
Kpp!nK<T signed checks amounting to more
tlian $3C00. During the months of February.
March and April SO per cent of the checks
mm Mgned by Jacob Eppingcr and but tt per
tf-nt by Bernard Â¦ Ettlinger, yet they claim
Jacob Eppingf-r was not actively In the busl
neÂ»b.
We have shown that Jacob Eppincer com
mitted the most fttupendous crime *>ver perpe
traXed in this- Statf. It was not a failure.
The . rottenness of the firm extended over a
period of years. No reputable bufinefg house
ktiGYlsgly lore*, certifirates, but this firm
issued warehouse receipts for grain that had
not ev<n b**n plumed. The evidence shows
that only I'TiOO tons of good shipping wheat
were tn the warehouse. Where there should
have been forty to fifty thousand, and Dem
fam. superintendent of the warehouse, with his
haar-des look end lies dropping irom his lips,
6ays the wheat was actually there
JACOB SIGNED CHECKS.
We claim that the transaction of April 14.
1903, Â«as Bernard Ettlinjrer's. If it is proved
beyond a reasonable doubt that Jacob Ep
pir.gf-r *va t the man responsible, then and then
Â«jr,ly have you a right, ia the Juryroom, to
mention other transactions. The Pacific Coast
Warehouse Company was identical with the
firm of nrrinrer & Co.. and when the firm
p'edged train with banks it knew that the
grain or its equivalent was in thÂ» Crockett
warehouse. By a mere accident lets 107 and
70S found their way aboard the Pierre Lotl
Â«nd were shipped eff to South Africa, but
wheat cf equal quantity and quality remained
In the warehous*. â¢ â¢ â¢
I will leave with you this eld man. In
his present condition of health there is little
l*"ft for him to do In the course of nature
but die. Won't you let him die In his own
txxl. with his wife, who has been his faithful
cotr.pariior. for fcrty years, beelde him? Her
Irish blood is steadlast and she will , stay
Â»:th him to the last. Will you. on the word
of Berk arid Kaytwick, *end him to his death
Sn a felon's cejl? â for that is what conviction
would wean â or will you return him to his
r.[fv and family as you expect to-morrow to
return to your loved <ir.eÂ«. from whom you
have so \onz been separated?
Attorney Dunne's argument dealt
largely with the doings of the missing
Bernard Ettlinger, on whom he at
tempted to throw the blame for any
wrong transactions. He made an im
passioned plea for mercy to the aged
defendant. He led the jurors through
a maze of figures, seeking to show the
inagnitude of the business of Eppinger
At Co. ami the utter improbability of
Jacob Eppinger seeking to defraud any
man out cf so paltry a sum as $9S00.
During the course of his argument he
said:
The concluding arguments in the
case and the charge to the jury occu
pied the entire day. The courtroom
was crowded with onlookers, eager to
take advantage of the last opportunity
to see the a^ed millionaire on trial for
his liberty. Epplager was accompanied
in the courtroom by his wife, his sons.
Joseph and Morris, and his nephew,
Herman. Throughout the scathing ar
raignment by District Attorney Bying
t<m he maintained his composure, but
Mrs. Eppfnser broke down and wept
c< -piously.
Attorney Ach, of Eppinger's counsel,
had requested the indulgence of the
court to make a brief closing state
ment, but at the close of Attorney
Dunne's argument he announced that,
while he had much to say, he pre
ferred to let the matter go to the Jury
vithout further remark, intimating
that he was wrought up over the clos
ing words of Dunne's speech and their
effect on the defendant, who was in
a lachrymose condition.
BLAMES ETTCJ-YGER.
After a trial lasting over six weeks
the case of the people of the State of
California against Jacob Epplnger,
charged with obtaining money by false
pretenses, was submitted to the Jury
Fhortly before 6 o'clock last night and
the defendant remanded to the custody
of the Sheriff. He was not at once
taken to the County Jail, like a com
mon felon, but at the urgent request Of
his counsel, backed up by affidavits
from physicians as to his health, the
Fheriff took the responsibility of per
mitting the prisoner to go home for
dinner under his escort.
Tfee case against Jacob Eppinger,
charged xtitlx obtaining money by
fraudulent representations was given
to the Jury at 4:50 p. m. yesterday. At
1 1 p. m. the jurors had not agreed on
a verdict and were locked up for the
nisbt.

PLEADS FOR MERCY
CHICAGO, July 22.â Blazing fiercely
from wheels to roof, a runaway motor
car on the Metropolitan Electric Ele
vated Railway whizzed by hundreds of
waiting passengers and led a fire en
gine a chase of more than a mile and
was not stopped until It had reached
the crowded loop In the downtown
region used by the four elevated roads
of Chicago. The car was brought to a
stop by the temporary shutting off of
the power at the supply station, the
engineer of the power-house having
been advised that a runaway car was
speeding downtown.
When the car was first found to be
on fire it was detached and was run
past the Aberdeen street station so that
neither the rest of the train north and
the station might catch fire. The train
was left -alone and a fire engine was
called. For some reason. Ju3t as the
firemen were making ready from be
low the elevated structure to send a
stream of water on the blaze, the car
suddenly started.
"With no one on board and leaving a
trail of fire and smoke behind it. the
runaway began the wild race down
town. "When the car stopped at the
loop entrance the fire engine, distanced
in the first part of the chase, came up
and put out the fire, but not before
the car was a charred wreck.
BUTTE, Mont., July 22. â Two more
suits were begun in the District Court
to-day by the Boston and Montana
Company to recover damages to the
amount of many millions of dollars on
account of the alleged looting of large
quantities of valuable ore from the ad
joining mines through .the Minnie
Healy workings. In the two suits that
were begun to-day Judgments are
asked to the amount of $7,400,000, mak
ing'a total, with the big suit that was
begun on Thursday, of $13,150,000 for
ore alleged to have been unlawfully
extracted from the veins of the Colusa.
Piccolo and Gambetta mines through
underground workings in the Minnie
Healy.
In the five suits that have been begun
against Heinze and his agents, alleging
the looting of ore from the Michael
Davltt, Little Mina, Colusa, Piccolo and
Gambetta mines the judgments In
damages that are asked aggregate $16,
850,000.
The two suits begun to-day -were
against Heinze corporations alleged to
have been in j charge of the Minnie
Healy at different perlojds in the com
plicated proceedings that have arisen
through the litigation over the prop
erty.
A young woman, supposed to be
Anna McCoy, was found dead in the
sand dunes at the beach last evening.
The corpse was discovered lying face
downward a Quarter of a, mile south of
the United States Life Savins Station
by a man and woman whose names are
unknown. They notified Captain
Varney of the life saving station.
Varney did not know that the woman
was dead and notified the Park Hos
pital. Dr. Pawlicki responded to the
call and on his arrival pronounced the
woman dead. In his opinion she had
been dead for several hours. He could
not tell what had caused her death.
Deputy Coroner Fennel removed the
body to the Morgue. There was nothing
In the way of a positive mark of identl-.
rtcatlon among the woman's effects.
In her purse was an aluminum tag
bearing the name "Anna McCoy." A
chatelaine bag of brown leather was
found near the body. In it was a small
purse containing 10 cents and a s"hirt
stud bearing an imitation diamond. She
had a handkerchief with the initial "A"
embroidered in one corner. In the hand
kerchief were several small red candies
and a key.
The dead girl wore a wedding ring
and a plain band gold ring on the first
finger of the right hand. On the third
finger of the left hand she wore a small
imitation gold ring with ' two blue
ttones set in it.
The woman was about 27 years old,
about five feet In height and of medium
build. Her features are regular and
the head is crowned with a wealth of
pretty brown hair. Her right upper
eye tooth is gold crowned, and the
bicuspid immediately back of it is
broken away. The piece of the broken
tooth was found in the handbag. She
wore a brown tailor-made suit, pale
blue straw hat with pale blue flowers
as a trimming. The Jacket of the suit
was trimmed with yellow lace. In the
girl's white waist was a small silver
heart pin.
Deputy Coroner Fennel is inclined to
think that the girl was sick and fell
in the sand and became smothered.
Her mouth and nostrils were clogged
with sand. Another theory is that she
took poison of some kind, speedy in
its action, and fell unconscious on her
face.
Up to a late hour this morning: the
corpse had not been identified.

Captain Dutton is now at the Mare

tain Dutton claims to have been' out
of condition both physically and men

It was decided, however, that as he
said nothing about this at the time of
his examination and as the examiners
are of the opinion that his condition
then , was all right, his request should
be denied.

bride and groom were present. Imme

even known ' to their closest friends.

moon and then return to San Francisco,
where they will reside permanently/'".
The mother of the late ; Senator
White, with whom. Mrs. Troy resided
for some time after her first husband's
death, declines absolutely to discuss the
affair.' She admitted that the news
caused lifer some astonishment. 'Her
daughter-in-law at no time confided, in
her the fact that she contemplated! a
second marriage.'
The groom has two brothers' in this
city â Daniel Troy, assistant cashier ; in

informed by telegram.
Mrs. Troy: is the mother of three chil
dren by her first marriageâ -two 66ys
and a girl. The eldest, a son, is about
17 years of age.
. It was generally thought that after
Senator White's death on February 22,
1901, the widow would remain incon
solable. But time, the healer of all sor
rows, has softened her griefs and per
mitted her to take up again the respon
sibilities of wlfehood. "â¢â¢: Â¦ ' Â¦
When his famous friend had been
called to the beyond Troy took
charge of the widow's affairs. His as
siduity for her welfare and that of her
three children probably touched Mrs.
White. At any rate, she did not look
upon his attentions with coldness. ,
Â¦ Naturally Mr. Troy had to make sev
eral visits of late to Los Angeles to talk
with his charming client about the suit.
It is evident that on one of these visits
he pressed his own suit in a court
where she was both judge and jury.
His arguments were successful and a
decree in his favor was declared; at the

friend of his present wife's husband
for fifteen years. During the campaign
that resulted in the election of Senator
White, Troy was secretary of the Dem
ocratic organization. Troy accompa
nied the Whites to Washington, where
he acted as private secretary to the
Senator.
Senator White, who always felt a
warm friendship for the young man,
later helped him to secure a desirable
clerkship in the Senate. He held the
position for six years, during which
he studied the great men of the world
as seen on the stage at Washington.
Often he heard arguments In the Su
preme Court of the United States.
Later he made a tour of Europe on a
Government mission. Returning to
San Francisco, Troy began the prac
tice of law with success. He has also
been prominent in politics and the
conservatives wanted him instead of
Livernash for Congress. Troy is now
suing on behalf of his wife, though in
the name of Mrs. White, for the Sen
ator's share of the fees for recovering
the famous Pious fund of the Catholic
church. â¢
TIME SOFTENS HER GRIEF.
The remainder of the evening was
taken up with listening to a speech by
Abe Ruef, in which he recounted his ex
perience in the East.
The meeting also voted, on motion
of George A. McGowan, that each of
the Assembly District committees elect
officers and trasmit to the secretary
the lists of officers elected, and that the
meetings held in the Assembly districts
for the purpose of electing delegates
to the County Convention be in charge
of the respective Assembly District
committees. Leon Samuels objected to
this and wished to place the Twenty
ninth District on record as voting in
the negative, but he was voted down.
R. W. Dennis moved that a commit
tee of eighteen, one from each Assem
bly District, be appointed by the chair
for the purpose of preparing a plan of
organization of this Joint committee,
with instruction to report at the next
meeting. ' The motion prevailed.
On ths motion of Supervisor Lun-
Btedt resolutions were passed pledging
undivided support of the joint district
committee of the Republican party of
San Francisco to the Republican nomi
nees during the coming election.
On motion of George A. Wells it was
ordered that the Assembly District
committees transmit to the secretary
of the joint committee the names of the
candidates of the respective Assembly
districts for the position of delegate to
the Republican State and local conven
tions.
Many local Republicans last night at
tended th<$ joint meeting of Assembly
District subcommittees. The confer
ence took place in the Shiels building,
32 O'Farrell street. Little was accom
plished. Owins to the absence of
Thomas Riordan, chairman of the
County Committee, Secretary Thomas
B. Atkinson occupied the chair. This
caused a protest from Richard Cox,
who is second vice chairman of the
con-mittee. When, however, he under
stood that it was not a County Com
mittee meeting, but a meeting of the
district delegates appointed during the
last four months, he withdrew his ob
jection.

A few hours later it was given out
that the gambling element had agreed
to send the "grafters" and hangers-on
out of the city by 3 o'clock, pending
which no call for troops was to be
made. This agreement was carried
out and the objectionable persons left
town on an afternoon train. This had
the effect of producing a calmer feel
ing and little apprehension is felt of
any further trouble.
At noon a call was* made by the
Board of Trustees upon Governor
Herreid asking that troops be sent to
Bonesteel. A reply was received stat
ing that the' Governor was out of the
city, but that the troops could bÂ« fur
nished if necessary.
Early to-day there was a meeting of
citizens" to devise ways and means
to prevent the lawless scenes of last
night. At this meeting it developed
that Superintendent 1 of Registration
John McPhaul had issued what proved
to be a virtual ultimatum to the ef
fect that the riotous scenes of last
night must not be repeated or he
would remove the registration office
to some other point and request that
troops be sent here for the protection
of life and property. McPhaul was
asked to delay his request for troops
until the city authorities and the
gamblers could get together on some
basis of settlement.
BONESTEEL, S. D., July 22. â
Bonesteel has been quiet to-day. It
was not until nearly noon that
the streets began to show their ac
customed numbers. Early in the
morning gambling games, which had
been compelled to abandon the street
corners last night, took their accus
tomed places at the edges of the
walks and upon vacant grounds ad
jacent to the streets. But* before noon
they had been forced to desist the
plying of their trade. Inside games
were running as usual, but with great
ly reduced patronage.

The indictment grows out of the con
fession of Charles F. Kelly, former
member of the House of Delegates, who
says that Butler gave him $15,000 for
leaving the country and staying away
until the bribe-grvers, against whom
he had damaging evidence, were pro
tected by the statute of limitation. It
is understood thai Butler has already
given bond to answer to the charge.
The expected indictment against a
politician close to Butler and against
"the man higher up," who also figured
in the confession of Kelly and former
Delegate Gutke, were not returned.
The members of the jury came into

ESOPUS. N. Y., July 22.â Information
reached E*opus to-day that Senator

the dispatch from Washington that
Gorman had reiterated nil declaration
that some younger man 5hould be
i.ho?en. William F. Sheehan, who was
the choice of many Eastern leaders,
was with Judge Parker at the time.
When asked whether he would permit
bis name to Â£O before the meeting of
;h*Â» national committee, to be held at
the Hoffman House in New York on
Tuesday, h* rtplied laughingly: "Oh.
nobody wants me for chairman."
Then. Ftriously, he discussed briefly
his position, making it plain that he has
not allowed his name to be considered
bjr party leaders, and that he stands
firm in his refusal to serve as manager
of the campaign. From his attitude he
no longer can be regarded as a possi
bility. August Belmont also has as
serted that he will not accept an active
part in the campaign management, and
thus Taggart is apparently the only
fne left in the race.
Arrangements wore completed to-day
to ship to Epopus a thirty-room, one-

later the two bodies met in Joint con
ference again and threshed ou^t the
whole matter.

One of tbe greatest American millionaires
once Â«Â»id to his physician, "A million dol-
lars, Z>octor, for a new stomach, * and then
tbe sick ou cmntd and turned a war.
One of a man's greatest pleasures is that
bora of a keea appetite, vigorous digestion
and a good dinner, aud thiÂ« belongs to
tr.cr.y a food fellow who is living on small
m-2ges, bet the rich man without a. stomach
has to forego the rood things of the table
becante his stomach rebels. Without a
healthy 6tom3ch Â£.nd a good digestion, our
blood is thin, watery and poor, our heart
action is weak, our liver does not do its
duty, aad man is miserable and unhappy.
In this condition man is prey to the germs
of inflnecxa, consumption, malaria and all
tbe ills that he is heir to. Consumption
can be treated by natural methods which
are as "lose to nature as possible.
Dr. B.. V. Pierce, chief consulting physi-
cian of tbe Invalids' Hotel aad Surgical
Institute, at Buffalo, N. Y., years ago un-
derstood this disease, and after a long pe-
riod of experiment discovered certain roots
aad herbs which were nature's remedies,
asd succeeded in putting them up in a
form that would be easily procured and
readr to use. This be cauea Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery. It gives no
false stimulation because it contains no
olcohol aud no narcotic. It helps diges-
tion and the assimilation of such elements
in tbe food as are required for tbe blood.
Instead of a cod liver oil, against which
the already sensitive stomach will declare
open rebellion, this tonic has a pacifying
cction upon tbe sensitive stomach and
gives to the blood the food elements the
tissues require: It maintains the patient's
nutrition by enabling him to eat, retain,
digest and assimilate nutritious food. It
overcomes gastric irritability and symp-
toms of indigestion, and is this way fever,
night- sweats, headaches, etc.. are done
sway with. It fortifies the body against
the germs of consumption grip ana ma-
laria, and it builds up the tissues and puts
on healthy flesh.
Whra the dmggist says he has some-
thing that is* just as good "as Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery, he says bo be-
cause he hopes to make a better pront,
but hi* own nurtures have not stood the
test of loag experience nor had tbe success
tfcal Or. Pierce's medicines have had.

Major Charles P. Braslan announces
the engagement of his daughter, Miss
Virginia E. Braslan, to John E. Cal
houn of Minneapolis, Minn. Miss Bras
lan has for a few years been furthering
her education in music and language
at Boston, Mass., residing there with
her grandparents.. Mr. Calhoun is a
prosperous young business man, being
engaged in' the grain and milling busi
ness at Minneapolis. He is the son of
the Hon. John E. Calhoun, well known
throughout the northwestern " country.
Mr. Calhoun's father is a member of
the Minnesota State Legislature. Miss
Braslan, who spent the summer here
with her father two years ago,' is a
lady of charming personality. The date
of ithe wedding has not been fixed, but
it will take place some time during 1 the
coming fall or winter.
The winning of Mrs. Josephine Morris
de Greayer by the gallant Captain
Rowan is the climax of his achieve
ments â but what might not have been
expected of the "man who bore the
message to Garcia"? Has it not often
been said that he who is the best war
rior is the best lover? Neither, to win,
may be laggards, and the quality of
mind that makes the one makes the
other. It is hoped that the man who
has captured the heart hitherto so well
guarded from Cupid's darts may soon
be among us, that he may hear the en
comiums offered as sweet incense to
the woman who has won him.
The engagement of Miss Sadie Quinn,
daughter of Mrs. John Quinn, to Thom
as F. McDermptt has been formally an
nounced. Miss Quinn, the only daugh
ter of the household, is a charming
young woman and a rare favorite in
her set. Ever since childhood the fair
fiancee has wdn many laurels by her
skill at dancing, having been favorably
compared with the famous Lois Fuller
and other celebrities of the stage for
her rare grace. Mr. McDermott is a
clever young business man of this city
and, like his bride, is possessed of a
charming personality. The wedding,
which will occur during the early part
of October, will probably take place at
the home of the bride, which is ad
mirably adapted for such an affair.

REDDING, July 22.â When Simeon T.
Garrison appeared before County Clerk
Blodgett this morning to get a mar
riage license he could not think of the
name of his bride-to-be, and as a con
sequence was compelled to make a trip
home to refresh his memory. Garrison
is 69 years old, and the woman of his
choice is Elizabeth Stevens, aged 66
years, both residents of Stillwater,
twelve miles from Redding.
The aged lover was plainly excited
when he appeared In the Clerk's office.
Try as he might he could not recall the
name of his bride, and asking the Clerk
to wait a minute he started home, re
turning a few hours later, smiling and
happy. He had obtained the necessary
information. When he left the court
house he was the proud possessor of
the riece of paper with the big gold
seal that gave him the legal right to
become the husband of the woman of
his choice.

FRESNO, July 22. â Jim Durgin
thinks all there is in life is a prison
cell. He has tried the accommodations
in almost every county Jail in the San
Joaquin Valley, but they are too tame
for him and the visits do not last long
enough. He set fire to a train of box
cars on the Southern Pacific reserva
tion this afternoon and then gave him
self up, saying he wanted to go to the
penitentiary.. He was taken to Jail by
Deputy State Marshal Timmins.
"Don't you believe I'm crazy," said
Durgin. "I've got tired, of laying out
on a hard board every night and taking
a chance of some hobo murdering me."
His hopes will no doubt be realized, as
his latest crime is a felony. Several
months ago Durgin came to the Fresno
County Jail and asked to be placed in
side. Upon being refused he picked up
a large stone and threw it through a
window. He has Just finished serving
a three months' sentence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Both took morphine.
Each. told a friend that she had de
cfded that Stevens loved somebody else.
Each said she had nothing to live for.
That two" young women should kill
themselves In six months in fits of Jeal
ousy over one man is considered re
markable, especially as the man in this
case is an ordinary appearing young
fellow. Both young women were highly
respected. Miss Bowser was 19 years
old and Miss Ellison was 20.
After the death of Miss Bowser it was
said that Stevens and Miss Ellison
were engaged. The couple attended
the races this afternoon and had a vio
lent quarrel because Stevens was at
tentive to other girls. Immediately
after returning home Miss Ellison went
to her room and she was found an hour
later unconscious, dying at 7 o'clock.
She told a friend that she and Stevens
had quarreled and she had nothing to
live for.
MARION. Ind., July 22.â Six months
ago Miss Cora Bowser killed herself be
cause her lover. Ross Stevens, paid too
much attention to Miss Bertha Ellison.
To-day Miss Ellison ended her life be
cause Stevens was paying too much at
tention to other girls. Between the two
suicides there are these remarkable
parallels:
Both girls killed themselves for the
Fame man.
Both lived in the same house.
Both were engaged to the same man.

RATIFICATION MECTIXG
OAKLAND. July 22. -The violent!
death of Michael Ahearn, the Oakland
man whose body was found yesterday [
in the Truckee River, near Reno, Nev.,
was predicted by a fortune teller and
expected by his family. So says his t
daughter, Miss Kate Ahearn. The '
young woman said to-day:
"Several weeks ago mother cr/nsulted 1
a clairvoyant, who, among other !
things, foretold father's tragic death. |
The fortune teller predicted that he â¢
would die by violence. Mother has |
worried greatly over the prediction j
ever since. It made a deep and lasting i
impr*>55icn.on her mind and she could
not get rid of It. When the news of j
fathers death reached us. it was what j
we all expected to hear."
Ahearn's home was at S25 Pine street,
this city, where his wife and three
daughters now live. His remains are
now at Reno awaiting shipment to his
family in Oakland.
Ahearn's skull was badly fractured
and there was a ror>e about his neck.
His body was found floating In the Â¦
stream and the particular location of
the assault is uncertain. Robbery
seems to have been the motive for the
#crime. The victim's pockets I were
Ahearn is the second Oakland man
who has been found dead in the Truc
kee River within one week. Only a
few days ago the body of Thomas
Brown Walker was taken from the
waters of the river, but there Is no
evidence of a crime In this case.
Ahearn's body was badly mangled
when brought to Reno. His skull gave
evidence of a brutal assault, after
which a rope had been used In choking
the unfortunate man.
Mrs. Ahearn was not informed of the
tragic death of her husband until late
this evening. She could suggest no
explanation - of her husband's death,
but thought the motive for the crime,
if one had been committed, must have
been robbery.
Ahearn left Oakland about six
months ago. He had been employed
by the San Francisco Construction
Company, but took a position with the
Government in Nevada. He was em
ployed* In the construction of several
large irrigation canals In the western
portion of the State and received a
good salary.

Oakland Of3ce San Francisco Call,
Mil Broadway, July 22.
- The body was first recognized, by a
friend who came from San Francisco
this morning, a man who. did not leave
his name with the Coroner. When the
news got abroad that the -body" of
"Jack" Spires was in" the Morgue a
number of his old friends in to-wn rec
ognized at once that he was the man
,who formerly lived and worked in
"Berkeley. Among those who identified
him were W. R. "Wright, George
Thompson, S. J. Sill, Fred Foss and
H. F. Dikeman. This evening H. H.
Cory of the Union League Club of San
Francisco 'identified Spires. .
Mr. Cory said that he met him a
week ago In San Francisco white he
was walking along Ellis street. Spires
was then standing, near Corbett's sa
loon in company with Frank Moses, for
merly of Woodland, which was also the
home of "Spires. Mr. Cory said that
he* had never heard that Spires was
married or that he ever masqueraded
under an assumed name.
Spires was a heavy drinker and the
theory, regarding his death is that he
came to Berkeley while under the in
fluence of liquor and wandered about
until he came to the spot in the hills
where his body was found and lay
down, there contracted a chill that re
sulted first in congestion of the lungs
and heart and finally in death. The
autopsy physician's findings bear out
this theory and there is not any sug
gestion of foul play.
Spires was a native of Woodland and
32 years of age. He was reared by his
grandfather, S. G. Baker of "Woodland,
his parents being dead. His only other
relatives are an aunt. Miss Ella Baker
of Woodland, and Mrs. Lee La rue of
Yountyille, his sister. The body will
be shipped to Woodland for burial and
the inquest will be held next Wednes
day night.
J. R. Lame and L. A. Larue of San
Francisco, brothers of Mrs. Larue's
husband, identified Spires' body to
night. J. R. Larue said:
â¢â¢Spires had been knocking around
San Francisco for several months
since he left Woodland. He dranS
heavily and in his cups would go to
Berkeley, his former home. A month
ago he was there while drinking. For
some time Spires had no steady work,
spending most of his time around re
sorts in San Francisco."
S. Jackson Spires is the name of the
man whose body was found In Co-ed
Canyon on the" State University
grounds yesterday by James von Loben
Sels. The identification is positive, hav
ing been fixed by a sister of the man
and Â¦ half a dozen "other people who
knew him as "Jack" Spires when he
was an employe of the Pacific Coast
Lumber Company four years ago in
Berkeley.

Mongolia Not Badly Damaged.
The vagrant chain r/Scked up in the China
Sea by thÂ« propeller of the liner 'Mongolia
did not do eo much damage as had been
feared. The big steamship is on Hunters
Point drydock and erjrly yesterday morning,
th>.- gigantic basin having been emptied of
water, representatives of the company. In
surance adjusters. United States Inspectors
and a small army of machinists gathered un
der the liner's lofty stern to clear away the
chain and investigate the extent of the dam
aze.
One blade of the propellor was considerably
bent and two othev blades bore dents where
the revolving chain had struck. The cone,
at the extremity of the shaft, which furnishes
protection to thÂ» big nut which holds on
the wheel, was fMftshed to pieces. .
Repairing the dnmage will be a simple mat
ter and comparatively inexpensive. While on
the drydock the Mongolia will be cleaned and
painted.' She will be taken off Sunday.
JUDGE COXLAN* ASKS FOR
BAIL CLERK FOR COURTS
PARRY REPLIES TO REPORT
OF SECRETARY MCCARTHY
"If the Supervisors refuse to make
the appointment," said the Judge yes
terday, "I will appoint a clerk for my
own court and pay him a salary.
Sometimes a batch of receipts for .bail
money is handed up to me for orders
on the Treasurer and it is too much
to ask us to go through the records for
days back in many instances for the
purpose of ascertaining the disposition
of the cases, besides writing out the
orders. That work should certainly be
done by a responsible clerk."
Police Judge Conlan, as Presiding
Judge, has sent a communication to
the Board of Supervisors asking for
the appointment of an additional clerk
for the Police courts, to be known as
the bail clerk. He suggests that as
the position would be a responsible
one the clerk be placed under bonds.
Since the scandal some years ago in
connection with the misappropriation
of orders for the return of ball money,
the Police Judges have been doing
clerical work in writing out all such
orders, and, as they are not under
bonds, the city would have to bear
the loss if a mistake were made.

STEADIER IAQUA LIBELED
FOR SALVAGE SERVICES
The cost of this work, as per bid of E. M.
Graney. would be 1650*4 horses with new
shoe* at $2 60 per horse, $4125 25; and
i'<22>a horses reset, $2045. making a total of
$6171 25. or a gain to the city of $301 63 by
letting the shoeing out by contract at these
prices.
Fire Commissioner Parry has writ
ten a statistical letter to Mayor
Schmitz regarding Secretary McCar
thy's report on the cost of shoeing
Fire Department horses. The secre
tary's figures were that the cost of
shoeing is $1 77 a horse. Commenting
on the figures the Commissioner says
that the outlay by the city has been
larger than reported. He concludes
his communication with the following
statements:
Secretary McCarthy's report Intends to con
vey the impression that $3588 71 for salaries,
S10G3 17 for material and $91 for fuel, making
a total of $4742 &8 was the total cost of shoe
ing all the horses of the department for the
year, and on which be bases his average of
$1 77 per horse. But to get the actual cost
all the expenses must be included, and to the
above must be added $75 per month, or $900
per year for salary of the ,man who brings the
horses from the various engine houses to the

Captain Walvig and the officers and
crew, of the steamer Rival filed a libel
yesterday in the United States District
Court against the steamer Iaqua for
salvage services rendered on January
31. 1903.
The complaint recites that on that
date, within twenty-four _ hours' sail of
San Francisco, the Iaqua. having
broken a crank pin, was at the mercy
'of the waves and displayed signals of
distress; that the signals were ob
served by the Rival, which went to her
assistance and towed her and a valu
able cargo of lumber into port on
February 1. The court is asked to de
termine and, award the sum due for
salvage.
The bark C. B. Keriney, which arrived yes
terday. 97 davs from, Newcastle, , Aus., re
ports that she experienced heavy weather in
the South Pacific. While riding out a strong
southerly gale she sighted a aquaxe-rtgged
vessel in latitude 25 degrees 25 minutes south,
longitude 1Â«7 degrees 147 minutes east. The
stranger was making bad weather of it, with
her forrtoomast and jibboom icone. She was
leaking, with the pump* going constantly. The
pea was so rough and the atmosphere no thick
with mist and clouds that the half-wrecked
vessel's name could not be made out, nor
could the Kcnney get near to speak her.

GOOD TRADE EXPECTED.
Favorable Conditions Shown in the
Ijcatlier and IÂ»iglron Business.
NEW YORK, July 22.â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say: Good progress by
most crops strengthens belief in favor
of advance of trade following the com
parative quiet and inactivity. Among
the industries quietness and dullness is
puIT the feature, but rather more is do
ing in the leather trade, foreshadowing
later developments in the shoe busi
ness, and the production of iron and
Fteel is being steadily curtailed, with a
J "suiting firmer tone to pig iron prices.
Several basic industries still show lit
tle tendency to revive. Notable among
these is soft coal mining, which is very
much depressed, and it is to be noted
that the demand for anthracite coal is
not so active as heretofore. Railway
earnings finished the fiscal year much
better than had been expected, and it
is probable they will show the heaviest
\olume of gross and net earnings ever
leported. Warm weather helped trade
as a whole and has facilitated bargain
sales, which has been a feature of a
number of cities.
Wheat (including flour) exports for
the wf>c-k ending July 21 aggregate
1.251.501 buEh^ls. against 1.412.498 last
week and 2.7&1.9SS this week last year.
From July 1 to date the exports aggre
gate 3.S72.908 bushels, against 8,815,852
la^t year and 12,161,306 in 1902. ..-'.'
Business failures in the United States

The rifle practice which has just
terminated at the Rodeo range re
sulted in Major Robert C. Van Vliet
carrying away the record laurels, with
Privates Cornett and Cox of the Tenth
Infantry close seconds.
The practice has-been going on for
ten days and has been participated in
by seventy-six men, who were chosen
because they represented the besf shots
from each company of infantry and
cavalry here. This practice was to
decide which men shall represent their
companies at the division shoot at
Monterey, which begins on Monday,
July 25. In the contest at Rodeo there
were forty-eight men of the Thir
teenth Infantry, twelve men of the
Tenth Infantry, 6 men of the Twenty
eighth Infantry and 6 men of the
Ninth Cavalry. Major Van Vliet was
in charge. The others that officiated
were: Captain James T. Bean nnd
Lieutenant G. C. Rockwell of the
Tenth Infantry; Lieutenants W. T.
Patten, S. J. Sutherland and M. A.
Wells of the Thirteenth Infantry, and
Lieutenant W. H. Patterson of the
Twenty-eighth Infantry.
The shooting was of fair order and
consisted of going over the marks
man's course twice for practice and
once as a record, from which latter
the selections were made.
The official programme of the shoot
ing was as follows: At 200, 300, 500
and 600 yards, slow fire, ten shots at
each; 200 and 300 yards, rapid fire,
ten shots at each in twenty seconds,
and two skirmish runs of twenty shots
each from 200 to 600 yards.
Major Van Vliet did some very un
usual work. He made 100 per cent
at 300 yards, rapid fire, and 4 8 out
of a possible 50 at 200 yards in twenty
seconds, rapid fire. The result of the
second shoot was as follows: Major
Van Vliet, 362 points; Privates Cor
nett and Cox. each 357 points.
The selected men will leave for the
competition at Monterey at 8 o'clock
this morning. The following officers
will go as competitors in the com
petition:
Major Rob-it C. Van Vliet. Tenth Infantry,

The trial of Lieutenant George S.
Richards Jr., accused of duplicating
his pay accounts while in Manila, was
resumed at the Presidio yesterday. It
began last March and has been taken
up from time to time as fast as docu
mentary evidence has been received.
The attention of the court was taken
up yesterday with evidence of this
description. It will be a hard fought
case. Richards was in court, attended
by his attorney, R. L. Hathorn. Col
onel William L.' Pitcher is president of
the board and Captain John J. Brad
ley is Judge advocate.. It is not ex
pected that the court-martial will be
able to get in all the evidence so it
will be able to come to a verdict be
fore the latter part of August or early
in September.
Major Frank E. Hobbs, command
ing officer at Benicia Arsenal, who ar
rived at his new, post July 15, paid his
first official call on General MacArthur
yesterday. :.
NEW YORK. July 22.â R. G.TOun &
Â« v>.'s weekly review of trade to-morrow
v. ill say:
Encouraging factors predominate.
Little definite increase is seen in" the
distribution of merchandise, but de
\ clopments of the past week promise
better things in the near future, the
most prominent influence for good be
ing lirighter crop prospects. For the
present the best news comes from the
large^ cities, where warm weather has
stimulated retail trade in light weight
fabrics. Jobbers â¢ report that orders
froro agricultural communities are
much better than from manufacturing
centers. There are still many com
plaints of slow collections. In the
principal manufacturing branches there
is still much idle machinery, especial
ly at cotton mills and iron plants, while
most window glass producers will not
resume until September. Reports of
railway earnings for July so far. show
only a small loss of 1.5 per cent, as
compared with the same period last
year.
It is gratifying to note in dispatches
from iron and steel making centers
that the decline in quotations has
cased and consumers are making in
quiries which promise to result in con-
Fid^rable business. Hides were
f trengthened by the packing-house dif
ficulty, particularly July saltings, of
Â¦which the supply is small.
Failures for the week numbered 213
in the United States against 191 last
vear and 20 in Canada, compared with
35 a year aeo.
Alleged That. He : Was Paid
Deposits on Property He
Had Nothing to Do With
The police are searching for Henry
H. Wilson, who, it is alleged, has been
representing himself as a. real estate
agent at 113 Geary street and obtain
ing money on sales of property for
whose owners he had no authority to
act. A warrant was issued yesterday
for his arrest by Police Judge Fritz
on a charge of felony embezzlement,
the complaining witness being Era
B. Zlmmer, 29 Eddy street, who is con
nected with the Porto Rico Cigar
Company.
Zimmer says that the property at
423 Hyde street was for sale and he
called upon Wilson on July 11. Wil
son represented that he was the agent
for the sale of the property, and, as
Zimmer was anxious to purchase it,
Wilson induced him to hand over to
him $75 as part payment on the de
posit.
Zimmer happened to see the owner
of the property a few days ago and
informed him of his payment of 575
to Wilson. The owner told Zimmer
that Wilson had no authority to act
as his agent and that the property had
been sold. The owner also said that
another man had paid $500 to Wilson
on the same conditions as Zimmer
and there might be still others who
had been deceived in the same way.
Zimmer called at Wilson's office, but
was unable to nnd him and it is sup
posed that he has either left the city
or moved to another location.
It has also transpired that Wilson
called at the Hibernia* Bank about
July 11, representing that he had been
sent by his attorney to borrow the
abstract of title to the property for a
few hours. He gave a receipt for the
document, but has not yet returned it
to the bank.

made by an officer at the League

that the bulk of the physicians would
be selected from Washington, New
York and Philadelphia. As there will be
fully 50,000 men engaged on the isth
mus, it is believed that 300 physicians
will be none too many to look after
their health. The higher positions will
be allotted to the Government sur

are needed, tough, wiry, hardy fel

WHILE the people of Sacramento are rejoicing
that a bond election has insured to the Capital
City a first-class high school building it is
approvingly observed that all classes of citizens give
the credit f*r the victory to the women. They could
not vote, but they could and energetically did work for
the good of the- rising generation. More votes were
cast than at any preceding special election in the his
tory of Sacramento. It was necessary that two-thirds
of the entire number of ballots polled should be in favor.
In fact the affirmative vote exceeded the prescribed two
thirds by more than 300. Victory was achieved under
circumstances that at the outset appeared to be de
cidedly adverse. This consideration helps to place the
achievement of the women on a high plane.
The purchase of certain school lots at prices that
were generally considered to be excessive had dampened
the ardor of, the public. After the preliminaries for a
bond election had been arranged it was discovered that
a technical defect had vitiated all the proceedings. A
warm discussion took place high school
fraternities which tended to divide the public mind. A
high school proposition had been defeated in the Clark
administration. Nevertheless, the women were deter
mined to have a high school building that shoufd be
fit for Sacramento. The politicians advised that they
would meet with failure. When was a woman ever con
vinced against her will when the interests of children
were at stake? The Sacramento Bee says that the
women "went ahead with a campaign that for vigor
and intelligence is unmatched in Sacramento politics."
To the women Mayor Hassett wrote that the result
could not have been' accomplished without their "well
organized work and strong personal appeals to the vot
ers." These coinciding and voluntary words of testi
mony are convincing.
The first step taken in the campaign was to have the
Board of Education provide that the high school fra
ternities should go out of business after a certain date.
Every fraternal society in Sacramento had high school
dinned into ears, morning, noon and night and co-opera
tion was secured in great degree. All clergymen were
requested to ask their congregations, to assist -The
streetcar companies were persuaded -to permit the
placarding of their cars with high school election ad-

The yield of the mitsumata paper
plani in Japan frequently amounts to
two thousand pounds of raw bark to
the acre. The crude pulp is readily
sold at thirty-two sen (sixteen cents)
the pound. The seeds alone are some
times quoted at three yen ($1 60) the
gallon. As many as tvjrenty-four thou
sand i shrubs are grown ; on an acre.
The harvesting is done by cutting the
plants off at the roots. The next spring
the shrub grows up again. In fact,
mitsumata roots a century old and
still sending up new shoots are often
shown. The plant is highly decorative
and* is grown as an ornament in some
of the gardens of Japan. â Booklovers'
Magazine.
The cultivation of paper plants in
Japan is a very important industry.
As is well known, Japanese paper of
various kinds is in demand throughout
the world. Recently American and
European manufacturers have been
giving some attention to the possibility
of producing from Japanese paper-pulp
some of the numberless useful articles
and toys similar to those in vogue in
the island empire. To that end, Japan
ese paper shrubs are to be planted in
America and in the countries of South
ern Europe. The United States De
partment of Agriculture, which recent
ly sent experts to secure seeds of the
mitsumata'plants, is to make exten
sive experiments in growing this par
ticular valuable variety. It is believed
that this shrub will thrive in Florida,
Louisiana, in irrigated parts of Texas
and the Colorado Desert and in some
sections of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin valleys in California. Should
this introduction of the Japanese mitu
mata plant into America prove suc
cessful It will bring fortune to many
farmers. Rice-planters, particularly in
Texas â the climate of which, it is be
lieved, will prove suitable to the valu
able exotic â could. set shrubs out along
the unoccupied dikes and on Â» all' the
narrow strips of land dividing 'flooded
fields ' and secure profitable returns
f rum the enterprise. The American ex
perts who have been investigating \he
subject in Japan are inclined to be
lieve that when the mitsumata plants
are grown successfully In America and
American machinery Is invented for the
conversion of the pulp into paper, that
product will be put to many uses not
thought of in Japan.

Chicago has raised by popular sub

dollars for the permanent endowment
of a great orchestra.
They have good reason to boast of
it, the Chicagoans; the like has not

Orchestras there are and have been
for generations as permanent institu
tions in all the great European cities,
but always subsidized, always main
tained by government, municipal or
national. So far, in thi3 country, al
though orchestral music has been
steadily growing in recognition as a
means of grace, it haa existed preca
riously by uncertain box office re

the public spirited, or, as in the not
able instance of Boston, by the gener

U -\ K R - DOOLE.V on the Political Situation" is
l\l\ thc title oÂ£ thc leading feature Â°f Th e Call
* Â» â¢*> Magazine to-<niorrow, and is the first in a
series of Dooley .stories which will be run in The Sun
day Call. Each article will be close to the news of the
day|| "Dooley" will discuss live topics in his own
inimitable way.
When F. P. Dunne began to write the Dooley articles
some years ago, he called himself the reporter of Dooley
monologues. Somewhere down on Archey road, in
Chicago, there lived the original of the old philosopher
and here Mr. Dunne visitiid frequently. It was not
long before Martin Dooley was the most famous char
acter in the whole country. ' His keen. Irish wit and his
curious manner of expressing", what he thought of public
men and affairs brought hina a remarkable popularity.
Finley Peter Dunne is now ivithout doubt the* highest
paid writer in the world, and it was only after keen
competition and an unusual contract price for a daily
paper that The Call secured the exclusive rights on
the coast north of Los Angeles for the publication of
the forthcoming series of the Dooley articles.
The frontispiece will consist of the second picture in
the series by Herman W. Hansen portraying scenes
and incidents in early California life and will be entitled
"The Prospectors." The first picture in this series,
entitled "A Vaquero Bear Hunt," appeared upon June
26. "On the Beach" is a full page drawing in black
and white by John F. Woolrich, ! whose work is well
known to Call readers.
"In the Bishop's Carriage," by Miriam Michelson,
runs through its third installment and finds the heroine
in a situation so critical that it seems for once even
her ingenuity and coolness .must fattl to extricate her.
Other fiction features embrace a full page story by Clin
ton Ross, a well-known magazine writer, called "A
Comedy of % Rebellion." in which theÂ» love affairs of a
wealthy and patrician daughter of the United States
unexpectedly involve themselves with a South American
revolution; a storiette, "Bess, Queen otf Strategists," by
Ruth Santelle, which holds the places of honor upon
the storiette page, and stories by Kate M. Cleary and
Lillian G., Paschal.
Among the special articles is "The Fisherman's Vaca

hints to prospective vacation seekers, wfto are in doubt
as to the field they shall select; "To St. Louis With a

Joseph Chamberlain has presented for the digestion of
his countrymen another elaborate series of tariff tinker

to enter the empire in the competitive race of the world

King Edward's reference in th#
speech delivered at the banquet given
in his honor by the Syndic and Senate
of Hamburg, to the "great empire of
which God has appointed me the ruler,"
has evoked no end of criticism In his

he owes his crown not to divine ap
pointment, but to the will of the peo
ple as expressed by Parliament. Indeed,
had It not been for the act of settle
ment of 1700, by means of which Par
liament the throne was vested In the
Protestant house of Hanover, Edward
VII would not be King of Englnand to
day. English people take no* exception
to the phraseology of the royal procla
mations, which invariably describe the
sovereign as "Edward VII, by the grace
of God King of Great Britain," etc. re
garding this as one of those medieval
figures of speech of which there are so
many survivals in official and state

to Edward styling himself in an after

GARDEN. LONDON, July 10.âMay
fair mammas with eligible daughters
nnd chaperones with fair aspirants for
matrimonial honors on their hands
have a grievance, for which they de
dare the young American matrons
who figure so conspicuously in fash
ionable society are largely responsible.
Their specific complaint is that
debutantes are no longer invited to
dances as of yore and that in conse
quence their chances of contracting
desirable marriages are greatly dimin
ished. And they assert it is chiefly
the brilliant and bewitching young
American wives in the London social
world who set the example of closing
the ballroom doors against young un
married English girls. Having once
taken the field they hold it against all
newcomers. It is they who dance and
give the dances for which invitations
are most eagerly sought. As notable
among these are mentioned Lady
Essex, Lady Grey-Egerton and several
others, in whose trains, as attendant
patellites, are many young English
matrons. At their smart terpsichorean
functions young unmarried girls form
en inconspicuous minority, while their
brothers, who often regard dancing as
a "beastly bore," receive more invita
tions than they can find time to ac
cept. Under such circumstances what
chance, asks the indignant British ma
tron, has the demure little English girl
just out of school against the bril
liancy and dash of the all-conquering
American woman in society?
The Duchess of Roxburghe is still
house hunting. She is now personally
known to nearly every fashionable
real estate agent in London and has
earned the reputation of being the
Ftiffest bargainer among all the Amer
ican ladies who have found their way
into the English peerage. "She also
is fastidious to the point of being al
most ridiculous," said a leading agent
â¢who has some of the finest mansions
in Mayfair and Belgravia on his
books. "Why," he added', "if I offered
her Buckingham Palace or Marlbor
ough House she would find fault with
them. She wants all London con
structed on the American principle."
It is thought likely the Duchess will
settle on a house in Cavendish Square,
as the owners of mansions in the
American colony in Mayfair are op
posed to any radical changes In the
internal construction of their prop
erties, especially when they are only
required for short terms.
That expensive and brilliant weddings
do not always insure the continued
prosperity of the young couples is a
truism that holds good from the high
est to the lowest- Certainly few mar
riages have ' been more dazzling than
that of Lady Peggy Primrose, the
daughter of the Earl of Rosebery, to
the Earl of Crewe, yet within a few
years even these, lacking the where
withal to keep up a home of their own,
have returned to live with the bride's
father.
Not in a generation would there be
cuch universal interest in the marriage
of any one girl as that manifested in
Lady Peggy Primrose's nuptials. Her
trousseau was an enormous one and the
order for her lingerie the largest with
one exception ever executed In Eng
land, or rather given in England, for It
v.-as executed in the convents of Ire
l8nd. The exception was the trousseau
of Lady Peggy's mother. Miss Roths
child, in which every article of wearing
apparel was multiplied by eight dozen.
The wedding was, of course, the func
tion of the season, presents from the
whole of the upper ten thousand, in
cluding Queen Victoria, being showered
upon the happy pair. The ceremony
took place at Westminster Abbey in
the presence of hundreds of eager
guests and onlookers.
The Earl of Crewe at the time of his
marriage had daughters of the same
age as his youthful bride, but he was
acknowledged by all the feminine crit
irs as being very handsome, besides
very young In spirit and by no means
old in years, and there was not the
sljgrhtest fear but that happiness for
both of them was well assured.
Financial difficulties were not expect
ed, but a great deal of money was
spent in the doing up of the Earl of
Crewe's house on Hill street, since
when things have gone wrong gener
ally. There is talk of unlucky specula
tion on the Stock Exchange. - To
straighten things out the Earl has sold
two estates in Yorkshire, given notifi
cation that he is willing to dispose of

"Well, I thought you had a spark of
manhood in you when I married you.
From seeing and enjoying Perkins'
disgraceful performance I suppose
now you could beat me."
"I could if you didn't play your
cribbage hands any better than Mrs.
Perkins was, doing when I called this
evening."
- "O-o-o, you " (Mrs. Moore
couldn't say it, but she looked it.)
"Do you mean to sit calmly there
before me and before your little chil

on and let that brute of a Perkins beat
his wife? Just answer me, stir."
"Certainly."
"I say Perkins was beating his wife,
but of course he stopped when I came
in."
"Well, I should hope he would, the
brute. And what did you do?"
"I begged him to go on, but he said
some other time would do as well."
"You BEGGED HIM TO GO ON,
and â he â said â some other â time â

less.)

''Oh, you wretch â youâ did â not â
want â to â spoil â the â FUN. You mis

"Eh!"
Virgil Moore, a downtown mining
and real estate man, lives out in the
far Richmond district Because of the
distance from the busy marts of trade
and wishing Mrs. Moore to keep up
with the times, he entertains her with
all the local news he may happen to
hear and also relates his own per
sonal experiences (she often finds the
narration edifying) Â¦ during the day
down in the city. Mrs. Moore enjoys
these evening stories and considers
them a liberal education. Here is a
sample:
"I stopped at Perkins" house as I
came home from the office this even
ing."
"You could not have had much time
for a call. Did you enjoy it?"
"Very. Perkins was beating his
wife."
"WHAT?"
Justifiable Battery.
It is no wonder that J. J. Hill and John D. Rocke
feller support Parker. There will be vacancies to fill
in the Supreme Court before 1908. In that court's re
view of the railroad merger case, the Democratic Jus
tices, Fuller, Peckham and White, held with Hill and
his trust. If changes on the bench make their minority
opinion the majority decision on a rehearing or a new
case, not only will all the seven cases against the trusts,
won by President Roosevelt, be reversed, but the court
will put constitutional limits upon Congress that will
weaken future legislation. Gold Democrats vindicate the
wisdom that was upon them in 1896 by refusing to play
in such a game.
MR. DAVID B. HILL did not succeed in satisfy
ing anybody except himself. Belmont and Hill,
when he nominated Parker and made a paren
thesis platform. Mr. Bryan supports Parker, but the
chairmen of the State committees in Michigan and Iowa
refuse to do so and have resigned and bolted. They
are free silver" men, but the discontent is not confined
to that faction of the party. The Gold Democrats
proper, the men who in 1896 made the gold standard
possible, are no more content than are the free silver
men. ,
They wanted an outspoken platform. They wanted
the gold standard recognized and accepted once for all
by the party. They wanted a plain and common-sense
statement of their position. They are not only for the
told standard, but they want the Government to end
its responsibility for any form of paper currency, except
the gold certificates. They want to kill, not scotch,
the fiat monev idea by redeeming, canceling and kill
ing the. outstanding greenbacks.. They want the stiff
ness taken out of the national bank currency and sub
stituted by a flexibility that will serve this country in
emergencies without putting public and private credit in
peril. They wanted and expected that the platform
would plainly utter these things. But at Mr. Hill's
dictation it is as voiceless as a coffin lid. Therefore,
the Gold Democrats are discontented, for the victory
is a barren one.
Hill and Belmont carried out the pretense that thr
two factions could meet on common ground in oppo
sition to the trusts, and proceeded to make an anti
trust platform and put on it a trust ticket, taking one
candidate from the Standard Oil trust and the other
from the bench. The Democratic Chicago Chronicle
sees through the trick from the gold side and refuses
to support Parker. The Sacramento Bee sees through
it from the free silver side and also refuses to indorse
the nominee.
It is true that we read in the Democratic press about
the intense satisfaction felt by the Gold Democrats in
Judge Parker's nomination. But when the names are
published, it is observed that the satisfied Gold Demo
crats are men who twice supported Bryan and free
silver. Of such are ex-Mayor Phelan, Mr. McNab and
Franklin K. Lane, Californians who let others stand on
the firing line while the battle of the standards was on.
It is natural that they support Parker, who was voting
against the gold standard when the fight was on and
now professes to love it so well that he had to kiss it
publicly â after his nomination.
The fact is that the Democracy is not yet in the
hands of men of principle. The titneservers and oppor
tunists have taken it away from the radicals, but its
new masters are ready to be radical, conservative or
anything else to get votes and win. The men who sup
ported Bryan on principle understand this perfectly.
They see in the class represented by D. B. Hill and
Gorman the men who shouted for Bryan in two cam
paigns, but did it with hollow hearts. Between the
real silver and the real gold men there may be relations
based upon mutual respect, but neither class can feel
respect for the men who have captured the party and
made the nomination.
The Earl of Ashburnham, who is the
second Roman Catholic in England,
the Duke of Norfolk being the first, has
lent Pembrey, his splendid estate "in
Carmarthenshire, Wales, to one of
these communities who are noted for
their cheese making. Another body of
these French refugees are negotiating
for an estate in Devonshire.
It is to America that the eyes of the
French religious communities probably
will be turning as their next land of
refuge. At the present moment these
refugees are about the one hope of
English landed proprietors who are
anxious to sell their houses and es
tates. It is now almost impossible to
Eell estates or even to let them in Eng
land. Times are not such as to en
courage English smart folk to take an
extra country seat for a year or bo,
much less buy one, and the wealthy
Americans who come over to England
are seldom attracted to those estates
that the owners are most anxious to
sell. Americans buying places in Eng
land want the old castles and such' like
historic dwelling places which are
mostly entirely out of the power of
their owners to sell. It Is out of the
way estates and mansions that can be
purchased, and these, while not ap
pealing to the American millionaires,
are especially suited to the different re
ligious communities â most of them
are enormously wealthy â which are be
ing expelled from France.
Belgium was, of course, the first
thought of these refugees on account
of the same language being spoken, but
the Free Thinkers, who are. so strong
there, make trouble for the religious
parties and turn their feast day pro
cessions Into free fights, so that others
leaving France are seeking more peace
ful quarters.
society entertaining. The ladles are to
be dressed after the style of the period,
but there is nothing yet to show that
the men will be put to any inconve
nience beyond the modern dinner at
tire.. The decoration of the rooms is in
the hands of a big West End firm, and
it is estimated that the cost will not be
much short of $10,000. Special men have
been imported from Paris and other
places on the Continent, as few English
workmen are acquainted with the style
required. The peculiar feature of Mrs.
Mackey's enterprise is that after the
opening dinner the rooms are to be re
stored to their normal state, and that
on every successive occasion when a
new departure Is contemplated the
apartments are to be again decorated
according to the style required. As
Mrs. Mackey's parties are to be lavish
and frequent the decorators are looking
forward to a harvest such as has sel
dom been experienced even in Mayfair.
The first party will be the most select
and will include most of Mr. and Mrs.
Mackey's American friends now in Lon
don. Later on English society belles
will figure largely at these entertain
ments.
DISSATISFIED DEMOCRATS.
Finally, when election day arrived, the women had
private carriages to go after stay-at-home voters and
take them to the noils that they might have no excuse
for not voting. Seemingly the men sought no excuse.
They came out in great strength and the women had
their way, as they generally have. The schoolhouse will
be built. The architects' designs show that it will be
handsome and Â«Â»ven imposing. If on the cornerstone
shall be inscribed some tribute to the efficient agency

to or was lukewarm in the high school cause was per
sonally visited by members of the Women's Council,
the body that had the matter in charge in behalf of
the woiiacn. Warring politicians were induced to sink
all personal differences in this particular instance. Pic
tures Were thrown daily on screens in every theater in
Sacramento that attendants at performances might see
what thit proposed new high school would look like.
Shade tnses, electric light poles, in short all points of
vantage were decorated with election announcements.
Arguments' were v written by the women for the news
papers. Meetings called by the women were held in
all the city wards. An arrangement was made through
which the Southern Pacific employes were given time
out of the shops to vote. Voters throughout the length
and breadth of Sacramento were appealed to personally,
through the mails and by word of mouth, to do their
duty.

Two claims, footing $180,000, against
the insolvent Pacific Coast Warehouse
Company, involving unpaid loans
made to Eppiriger & Co., were allowed
in the Superior Court yesterday by
Judge Kerrigan. The proof of debt
for the Colusa County Bank in_'the
sum of $150,000 was made by the
cashier of the institution, T. Harring
ton, and the debt of $30,000 to the
Bank of Woodland, in Yolo County,
was made by Cashier J. S. Craig.
The borrowings of the Epplhgers
from the Colusa bank extended' over
a period from September 25, 1901, to
December 13, 1902. The amounts
ranged from $2725 to $28,000 and the
securities given consisted in negotia
ble receipts on the Pacific Warehouse
Company for grain In quantities from
1917 sacks to 24,918 sacks. The grain
given as security amounted to 30,000
tons, but on June 6, 1903, there was
only, 3500 tons in the warehouse and
because of the removal of the tags
from the sacks this could not be iden
tified as representing any of the re
ceipts given. It Is alleged that the
warehouse company converted all of
the grain to its own use.
, The proof offered by the Woodland
bank.was of the same character, the
largest sum borrowed by the Epplng
ers having been $11,300 on Ma^rch 21,
1903. The security was 7487 sacks of
grain and the bank's share in what
remained Â»n the warehouse was not
worth more than $100. ! '.

tax of $75 per quarter on public dance
halls and ballrooms. Lunstedt, who
introduced the ordinance, argued that
it was an injustice to exact a liquor
license in addition to the $75 license
from such places and thought the lat
ter should be abolished. Comte and
Brandenstein expressed themselves as
opposed to the repeal, as it would af
fect many dives along Barbary Coast.
Comte wanted the roll call to settle
the matter at once, but Boxton
thought further inquiry should be had.
Chief of Police Wittman sent word
that he protested agrainst abolishing
the license, and action was postponed
for two weeks..
The committee expected to receive

Police Judge Fritz has passed up to
a. Justice's Court the delicate task of
deciding whether Mrs. A. McHugh of
270 Shipley street or Peter Fanning, of
COS Folsom street is legally entitled to
exclusive possession of one highly edu
cated white dog, variously described as
a Maltese terrier and a Lancashire
tyke and responding with equal alac
rity to the titles of "Jip" and "Lion."
Ponding nnai adjudication of its dis
puted ownership the animal is under
detention in the City Jail, it having been
taken from the custody of Mr. Fanning
by virtue tit a search warrant issued in
accordance to Mrs. McHugh's complaint
that she, and she alone, was entitled to
have and to hold it. The complaint set
forth also that Mr. Fanning had il
legally and with force seized the dog
as it was accompanying Mr. McHugh
along Folsom street.
Aftoi both sides had produced wit- !
nesses to uphold their resjy^ctive claims !
the Judge ordered that .the dog be
brought into court and permitted to
show where his preference lay as be
tween the disputants. This move was'
suggested by Attorney Shortall. who
stated that his client, Mrs. McHugh. '
had taught the animal to dance and
l>eg and perform several other feats
reflective of rare canine intelligence,
and that she was prepared to put him }
through his paces right there and then
if it pleased the court to admit such an
exhibition. So the dog was brought in,
l>ut he bestowed his tokens of affection
pt< indiscriminately that the evidence
of his tail-wagging and fawning proved
valueless. When he was instructed to
dance by Mrs. McHugh, who had
equipped herself with a bag of home
made doughnuts to be utilized either \
as bribes or rewards, he waltzed around
upon his hind legs and barked enthu
siastically, but a minute later he re
peated the performance at the request
of Mr. Fanning, who worked without
the aid of doughnuts. Then a bunch of
hair, which Mr. Fanning said he had
i lipped from the dog ere it ever became
the household idol of the McHughs,
was offered for comparison with the
hair now clothing the animal, but the
offer was rejected on the ground of ir
relevancy, incompetency and several
other things. Mr. Fanning then de
clared with much emphasis that he
would rather lose $100 than the dog;
not that he considered the latter in
trinsically worth that sum, but because
his children loved It. Mrs. McHugh as
serted that she, too, had learned to love
the dog almost as dearly as she loved
Mr.' McHugh. and to permanently de
prive her of its society would be to
visit a blight upon her household.
"It's a question of title," said the
Judge, "and as such must be settled by
a Justice of the Peace."
So the dog went back to prison with
the bag of doughnuts in his mouth,
and Mrs. McHugh and Mr. Fanning
never looked at each other as they left
the courtroom.
That chicken tamales really contain
chicken was one of the things proved
by the case of George M. Cook, tried
lor battery before Judge Conlan. The
complaining witness was A. Fodera, a
poultry dealer, who testified that when
he went to Cook's tamale factory, at
405 Fourth street, to collect $23 due for
chickensâ age not givenâ ordered and
supplied, he was violently assaulted by
the defendant and some of his em
ployes. The case was continued till to
day, and then occurred an incident
almost as startling as the disclosure
that chicken tamales are not of feline
extraction.
After the parties left the courtroom
they congregated in the corridor and a
Â¦wordy altercation between "Vic" Mar
tini, who was Fodera's attorney, and
Cook was brought to an abrupt ter
mination by the tamale-maker aiming
a right swing at the left Jaw of the
l>!eader, who adroitly sidestepped the
blow and then countered with such
force and precision as to knock the
ether man prostrate. Cook returned
to the court and demanded a warrant
for Martini's arrest on a battery
charge, but after hearing the state
ments of several eyewitnesses and
charply questioning the applicant his
Honor refused the request, opining
that as Cook opened the hostilities he,
Instead of Martini, should be the one
rrrested. Martini, however, magnani
mously refrained from filing com

There was a lively scene yesterday
at a special meeting of member^ of
the Board of Health with Supervisor
d'Ancona of the Finance Committee.
For a moment it looked as though
D'Ancona and Dr. 'Poheim, a member
of the Health Board, would engage in
hostilities. The meeting was called for
the purpose of arriving at an under
standing regarding a modification of
the report of the Finance Committee
taking the Health Board to task for
alleged violations of civil service re
strictions and salary allowances in the
budget. Dr. Ward, president of the
Health Board; Health Officer Ragan
and Deputy Health Officer Louis Levy
were also at the meeting.
When the discussion had nearly
come to an end Dr. Poheim said he
knew of his own knowledge that cer
tain Supervisors had violated the civil
service regulations by placing laborers
in Chinatown who "were not on the
civil service eligible llst v This asser
tion evidently caused D'Ancona to lose
his temper, for he hotly retorted: " .
"That's a lie"
Poheim's face flushed and as the
meeting broke up said to D'Ancona:
"I would like to see you outside
some time. You have made certain
assertions which I want explained. I
may communicate with you later,"
and Poheim retired with his fellow
officials.
Previous to this incident, which re
sulted from the strained relations
existing between the Finance Commit
tee and the Health Board, Dr. Ward
made a statement, in which he pleaded
for harmony and for a better under
standing between the boards, whereby
the best interests of the health affairs
of the city could be conserved. Ward
said that salaries had been advanced
because of increased work put upon
certain officials and that the best thing
the Board of Health could do would
be to resign if it was to be hampered
in its work. He further said that if
the Finance Committee's report was
adopted by the Board of Supervisors
it would play havoc with the adminis
tration of the Health Department. Dr.
Ward continued:
If the consolidation of the food department
with the bacteriological depaitrqent cannot bÂ«
effected to make efficient the power of the
board in the proper analyses . of milk. from,
the bacteriological standard, which Is the
only standard, and the examination of the
various food products by the laboratory, which
Is the only correct method, then all- of the
crusade as to impure milk . becomes obsolete
, through our inability to obtain a correct
knowledge and execute the laws. It
might as well be assumed now as later that
the Board of Supervisors has so tied the hands
of the Board of Health as to make its power
nil, and we might just as well surrender the
whole commission as to struggle with Inade
quate resources.

Charter Amendment . Committee yes
terday reported in favor of submitting
ta vote a proposed charter amendment
providing for a. modification of the
one-dollar limit clause on taxation so
that not more than eighty-five cents
of the tax on every $100 of assessed
valuation shall be used to pay the
running expenses of the municipal gov
ernment, ten cents for permanent pub
lic Improvements and five cents for
repairs to streets, sewers and public
buildings.
The amendment also provides that so
much of tha eighty-five cent tax as
may be available may be used for pub
lic improvements.
The committee also reported in favor
of another charter amendment provid
ing that the income from any public
utility may be appropriated from time
to time for operating expenses.
Three charter amendments providing
for progress payments on public con
tracts and for the approval by the
Board of Supervisors of all permits

mended.

The Marysville Democrat, describing
great dredgers that have been built to
operate near the channel of the Tuba
River a few miles east of Marysville,
says that the first one is ready to work
and the second will soon be finished and
Join in the work. The dredgers are 265
feet long. They cost about" $100,000 each.
The buckets will be able. to dig to the
depth of sixty feet. The Democrat says:
Each of the large iron buckets will take up j
an average of six cubic feet of Band, silt and
gravel to be washed and gold extracted.
Twenty buckets can be dumped in one minute,
an average to each boat of about 0480 cubic
yards ln a run of twenty-four hours. If the
deposits contain the amount of gold reported,
say 10 to 36 cents to the cubic yard. It can
readily be seen that these two dredgers will
i extract- a large sized fortune ln a month. A
large amount of electric power is necessary to
operate one of these boats, as there* are eight
Â¦motors to each. The main motor Is 100 horse
power two of . 50 horsepower, two of 20 and
the others less, . the total horsepower being
279. When in running condition, after all ma
chinery la In order and working as expected,
eight men will comprise a shift on each
dredge, and they will work eight hours each.
The great boats stand about forty-five feet
above the water in which they float.
The Democrat also calls attention to
the fact that . additional machines will
be constructed for work along the
channel of the Yuba River. Quartz
mining is more actively prosecuted in
Yuba County than at any preceding
time. The dredgers open up a new in
dustry.
According to the Bakersfleld Califor
nlan there is renewed activity in the
Kern County oil fields. The Calif ornian
says: 'd=>
The Associated Is not only making contracts
for the purchase of oil from independent com
panies and acquiring; new properties Jn other
fields, but it Is also arranging. to reopen sev
eral of Its Kern River properties which It. has
hitherto neglected. Among those to:be started

DREDGING ON THE YUBA.
The American Mining Congress very well
understands that since the establishment of
the Department of Commerce and Labor, with
mining as It la, a bureau within the bureau
of manufacture, it becomes more difficult to
secure 'an Independent department of mines
and mining. That affords no reason for lag
ging in the work for it. It is rather one of
the greatest incentives for concentration of in
fluence more active and powerful than ever
before. Everything is to be gained by an ear
nest and honest fight and nothing lost. As to
the Importance of the Issue â not alone to min
ing men, but to the whole country â there can
be no question. Â¦> '-.V.
Few explorers have ever endowed a nation
with a richer dowtr than the prospector. He
it was who gave California, Colorado and the
Great West to civilization. But for the prod
ucts of our mines there would be no Great
West to-day. The frontier would still be rest-
Lng on the Missouri River.
With the development of the mining in
dustry, the number of working mines has in
creased proportionately. Thousands of men are
working in mines and at mining plants. The
Interests" of these men must be safeguarded, not
ln an indirect way. not through a department
in which mining will figure as an incident
along with the lighthouse service, marine hoa
pltal service, bureau of foreign commerce and
similar branches of the public service, but In
an independent department of its own, .is the
agriculture of our country Is now cared for.
New and complex problems are arising in
the ''mining Industry constantly, which mupt
be Judicially considered by men equipped for
that purpose.
As far back as December, 1898, Charles D.
Walcott. director of the United States geolog
ical survey, reported to the chairman of the
Senate Committee of Mines and Mining that
he believed the mining interests of the country
should have a clearly defined representation
ln the organization' of the Government. In
1808 our mineral products were valued us
$687,820,720. ! They passed the billion dollar
mark in 1901. Certainly If such a department
was desirable ln 1S03 it is absolutely necessary
Â»lx yearn later.
DUE TO PROSPECTORS.
In its bearing on the general welfare and
prosperity of the country, mining, in the nar
rowest light one can lock upon It, is as pow
erful for good as any of the other State de
partments, and it is not impossible for even
the mort ordinary statistician to show, in pro
portion to the population, that the products of
the mlnine States are of far greater commer
cial value than the products of any : other
States ln the Union.
In considering this question we must not
associate It altogether with the precious
metals. The value of our bituminous and
anthracite coal production each year runs up
into the millions of dollars; also petroleum,
cement brick, clay and stone, arid the speci
fied mineral products on the mineral output
list of the Geological Survey number sixty
two, and with the mining industry, as it la,
still ln Its infancy. Certainly this infant is
quite large enough, quite important and strong
enough to be taken out - of - swaddling
clothes. It. pot only looks to be., but it is. out
of place when it is a bureau within the manu
facturer's bureau of the Department of Com
merce and Labor.
Irwln Mahon, 3ecretary of the Ameri
can Mining Congress, calls upon the
miners of California, through the agen
cy of a circular letter, to attend the
mining congressjand lend strong aid to
the movement f0r the Institution of a
national Department of Mines and Min
ing. Mr: Mahon asserts that in this
movement California played a leading
part at the beginning. A paragraph
from his letter follows:
i The Movement for t^s creation of an inde
pendent Department of Mines and Mining was
made fc.f- 'the welfare, <x>t of any one section
but the Intlre North A'-uerica. It was started
in California manv yeijrs a*o, and ,taXen up,
by the American Miniaj; Ccnrress in Denver^
in 1S9T. i with The Call of San Frtincisco as
I one of'ltK strongest anot most persistent advo
! cates, a<fd it would be ia serious loas of pres
1 tlee for California to be so apathetic at this
I time, - wJtcn the question Is surrounded . with
\ greater difficulties then it was when she
! championed its cause, io lose her loadershlp.
At the; coming assembly of the American
Mining Congress, meeting in Portland, Ore.,
August 22, 1904, this question will be taken
I up and discussed by statesmen of national and
international ' reputation, and by them,
through the American Mining Congress car
ried up to thÂ«* Congress of the United fotates,
and the part our mining Stateii and Terri
tories, especially California, ; Colorado, Mon
tana, Idaho. Wyoming. Â¦Washington. New
Mexico and Oregon, take in this coming strug
gle becomes a matter of record. .
IMPORTANCE INCREASES.
The importance to the mining inter
ests of the proposed Department of
Mines and Mining has increased since
The Call began its earnest advocacy of
It. The singular situation in which the
â¢petroleum miners of California were
placed under placer mining law is one
instance of note. The taking up of
mineral lands under the stone and tim
ber act and the scandals that have
originated in this method of land-grab
bing is another. A Department of Mines
and Mining will be needed always in
California, as in all the mining States.
Attention is directed to the following
statements that are now sent out by
'Secretary Mahon, representing the min
ing congress:
The United States is the greatest mining
country in the world, and yet we are the only
great nation that does not provide an ade
! quate supervision of the industry, and we can
never have a proper governmental supervision
! of the industry of mining until the Congress
! of the United States creates an Independent
' I>epartment of Mines and Mining, with a
Secretary at its head, who shall be a mem
. ber of the Pre*ldent's Cabinet.
j The Department of Commerce and Labor,
recently established, with its several bureaus,
â¢ ln which mining Is placed aÂ» a bureau within
' the bureau of manufacture, was no more nec
essary, nor even as much so, than is a De
partment of Mines. The placing of mines
. under the 'supervision of the Department of
' Commerce Is not only unsatisfactory, but it
1 Is a reflection on the Importance of the indus
try ln its relation to the welfare of the lndus
, trial life of the nation, and a detriment to
i its greater advancement and independence.
Mining has tremendous certainties. The
'value of our mineral products in 1880, was
j:Â»i(9,31S).000 In 1800 these products were val
â¢ ued at $Â«19,512.173. In 18Wt the value was
$97H,MX>,U4t>, and in ll'OO passed the billion
; dollar mark.
With Judge Mogan confined to his
home by Illness and Judge Cabanis3
away on vacation, there was double
duty for Judges Fritz and Conlan yes
terday, but the calendars were cleared
with neatness and dispatch. Judge Mo
gan's vacation begins to-day and Judge
Cabanlss returns to toil next Monday.
Joseph O'Donnell, who stole an arm
chair from a Mission street furniture
store, was given four months' impris
onment by Judge Fritz.
Three able-bodied male vagrants were
given eix months apiece by Judge Fritz,
who opined that the healthy man who
prefers vagabondage in the city to hon
est industry in the fruit orchards,
where such men are much needed just
now, is unfit to mingle in civilized so
ciety. The forlorn trio was rounded up
by Patrolman Brown, whose work was
commended.
Judge Fritz dismissed the charge of
practicing medicine without a license
which for several months the State
Board of Medical Examiners- had been
pressing against Dr. E. Schmoll, grad
uate of the University of Basle, Switz
erland, and former fellow of the Johns
Hopkins University. Dr. Hlrschfelder
of the City and County Hospital testi
fied it was at his invitation that Dr.
Schmoll came to San Francisco, and
that while awaiting a license to prac
tice he examined some, patients, but did
not prescribe for them. The Judge de
cided that while the defendant might
have technically violated the law he
did not do so deliberately. The testi
mony of a French boy called by the
prosecution proved a boomerang, for
It was to the effect that Dr. Schmoll
had resolutely refused to treat him.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Henry Fritz was arrested for disturb
ing the peace on Ninth street and gave
$20 bail for his appearance yesterday
before Judge Conlan. He appeared in
court all right, but while awaiting the
call of his case he went out 'to take a
drink, and the beverage indirectly cost
him his bail money, which was forfeit
ed when he failed to respond to the
shouting of his name by the bailiff.
Then a bench warrant was issued for
his arrest.
For about two minutes William St.
Clair Gloster, charged with murder,
was a free man. When he was called
for arraignment- before Judge Frit*
there was no formal complaint on file,
nor was any one present to prosecute,
so the Judge dismissed the case, but
ore Gloster could leave the courtroom
he was rearrested and taken back to
the City Prison, where he was held
while a complaint was filed. Then the
hearing was set for this morning.
Gloster struck A. J. Funk in the face
Â¦while the two men were walking along
Kearny street at 4 o'clock last Sunday
morning and Funk fell, his head strik
ing the stone curh. with such force as
to fracture his skull. Patrolmen
Dougherty -and Springett arrested
Gloster and Detectives O'Day and Mul
cahey were detailed to make further
investigations. All the officers testi
fied at the inquest, where the verdict
was manslaughter, but the charge of
murder originally booked against Glos
ter was not altered.
In explanation of their neglect to file
a complaint the detectives stated that
since the inquest they had not time to
prepare the case. The Judge told them
that the verdicts of Coroners* juries
are not considered in the courts and
that the police should prepare their
evidence for the preliminary hearing
instead of for the Coroner's inquiry.

depositing garbage upon a public thor
oughfare. Police Judge Conlan, who
owes exclusive allegiance to neither of
the municipal departments aforemen
tioned, dismissed the case and advised
the complaining policeman to lay the
matter before the Mayor, with a view
of inducing that functionary to get the
Board of Public Works and the Board
of Police Commissioners together for
the purpose of adopting a common pol
icy in regard to the removal of bottles
from garbage boxes on the public thor
oughfares.
The Nevada County Miner says that
an examination will be made of an old
river channel that' underlies the town
of Weaverville, ln Trinity County. Pros
pecting drills have been started. If the
discoveries are satisfactory shafts will
be sunk.
The Tuolumne Independent reports
that W. C. Stanley has sold four-flfths
interest in the Alexandra, Little Blue,
Happy Hooligan, Josephine, Swiss and
Victor quartz mines, between the North
Fork and main Tuolumne rivers, to J.
Jerome Smith, E. ,H. Cary, E. C.
Thwarte and L. M. Cutting for $60,000.
J. B. Ferris has bought the Barney
Collins mine, in Kern County, near the
Bright Star property, owned by Park &
Lacey. He is also interested in the old
Keys mine, at Keysville.
The Redding Searchlight reports live
ly times at Bully Hill. Two furnaces
are going. A railroad is in construc
tion that will run to the Anchor mine
from the smelter at De La Mar.
The Tulare Register reports that sev
eral companies have been organized to
work borax deposits in the Frazer Riv
er Mountains.
According to the Redding Free Press
the "Whlskytown district hag become
one of the liveliest In Shasta County.
The placer mines in Murderers Gulch
will be operated. The mill at the Gam
brinus mine is about ready to start.
The Mad Ox mine Will soon be oper
ating.
The Nevada County Miner reports a
good strike in "Willow Valley at the
Buckeye mine.
Property values at Keswlck are \ re
ported to have fallen since It became
known that the Iron Mountain Copper
Company will e'stablish Its smelter ln
Contra Costa County. Conversely this
shows how mining plants add to values.
The Placer Herald reports that the
Gold Blossom and "Evening Star mines
are about to shut down. Lack of capi
tal to operate is given as the cause.
. An odd phase of mining is reported
by the Jamestown Magnet, which says
that two professional divers went down
In the Draper mine in, 112 feet of water
to the cylinder of the pump, knocked
out the rusty bolts and replaced them
with new ones, -then cleaned out the
accumulated debris from the valves
and returned to the surface. Then
pumping was resumed.
Two hundred men, so says the Treka
Journal, are employed at Humbug
Creek, at and above the forks. Several
mines are to be largely developed. Six
mining claims and mining ground have
been sold by T. J. Nolton to the Rail
road and Mining Membership of Colo
rado.
The force of men laid off some time ago at
the South Eureka mine has been put to work
again and everyt^lhg about that property is
continuing full blast. Good progress is being
made on underground developments, while the
building of an addition to the mill will be In
progress before long on top. Twenty stamps
ot the Ballol mill have been purchased from
that company, and they will be put In place
at the South Eureka.
At the old'Treadwell mine, situated not far
from Volcano, but more recently known as the
Diana, sold by M. D. NUon to the Seattle
company, considerable work has been going on
under the new management. A five-stamp mill
has been moved from near "Volcano to the
property and is crushing ore.
The general underground work at the Ken
nedy mine continues the same as usual, while
the work of building an addition to the new
mill at the east shaft and the moving of the
old one continues. All the machinery of the
forty-stamp old mill is ln readiness to be
moved when conditions are such at the new
mill to receive It. When those improvements
are made the Kennedy will have a 100-stamp
mill. This number of stamps have been drop
ping for some time at the Kennedy mine, but
when all are put in one building work will be
facilitated and expanse saved.
Concerning operations of well-known
mines in Amador County the Amador
Record says:
completed .before the combine was formed and
absorbed the original" owners. The Associated
is now hauling lumber to - rig up the wells
and has started work on them Mgaln, cleaning
them out and putting them on the pump. The
Reed Crude property, â¢ which is now to be
opened . again, is on section 32 and is sepa
rated from that ln another part of the field

Alfonso Bell, the champion, is In the

this honor will fall to Fritz Overton
is almost a certainty. Two weeks ago
in the Ocean Park tournament Overton
beat Bell. This is the first tiine Bell
has losfin a tournament in nearly two
years. Overton has' always been a
crack player, but must have improved
considerably of late. He will play in
the September tournaments at San Ra
fael and the local cracks will undoubt
edly find him a stumbling block. Over
ton will probably be Bell's partner in
doubles.

Plans for a thoroughly equipped

quarters and an anchorage nearer, to

the beat out of the . estuary and the

light breeze. The ceremony of driving
the first pile was to have been held last
Saturday, but.was delayed for lack of
the - necessary material.

FOR YACHTSMEN
These valuable trophies have not
been up long but have already been
won twice by the same team. Herbert
Schmidt, one of the winners, is out of
town and the cups will go to* a new
team on Sunday. Rolfe and Schmidt
have their names on them twice. Smith
brothers, Allen and Hill and Allen and
Crawford have won the cups once, but
the 'latter is the only team now in the
competition.
On the Park courts the first and sec
ond classes will be completed to-mor
row and the third and fourth classes
commenced. In the first class there
will be three matches and they are all
expected to prove close and interesting.
Clarence Griffin and George Baker will
come together first and, although the
latter is expected to win, Grifflp is con
ceded a chance. He has been improv
ing lately, after having stood still for
about a year, and he will be a hard
man for the public court experts to
beat in future.
In. the other semi-final match Carl
Gardner and Robert Whitney will be
the contestants. Gardner Is a young
player who until recently has attracted
but little attention. In the last month
or two he Jias'beaten" some good men
and is playing a fine tournament game.
His opponent is an old player who has
seen his best days and it is doubtful if
he can take. Gardner's measure in his
present condition, i The Whitney of old
would have no. difficulty beating such
men as are in the first class, but he is
not playing the game he did once. The
seml-finals.wlll.be played at 10:30 and
the finals at 2:30.
;In the- second class but one match re
maifis to be played, and it should prove
a good one. Horace Mann and Fred
Adams will meetand they are so even
ly matched it would be hard to pick the
winner. Adams; ts erratic and cannot
be depended upon, while Mann plays a
steady, game and is always good for
about so muqh. He should beat Adams.
Mann is the only ambidextrous player
oh the coast. He ; is naturally right
handed and learned to play the game
with that hand. He now plays fully
as well if not better with his left hand.
The third and fourth class matches
will not be much to look, at, as the
players are possessed of but little skill.
They are . evenly matched, however,
and what they lack in skill they make
up for in enthusiasm.. ,,

Only accredited delegates to the Cali
fornia Coursing Committee are enti
tled to nominations in this stake. It is
expected that a full j representation of
the members will result In a twenty
four-dog stake. Each member will do
his utmost to secure the strongest
courser he can possibly get to run for
him and this should bring twenty-four
of the select dogs together.
Bids for the Mississippi Valley Fu
turity for whelps of 1903 and the Amer
ican Waterloo Cup will be opened Au
gust 1. It is expected that the club
at Friend, Nebr., will likely secure
the first event. The newly organized
Chicago club will bid for the Ameri
can "Waterloo Cup. Several wealthy
men are behind this club and its bids
might possibly secure both events.
The Mississippi Valley Futurity causes
much interest among breeders. In the
last running of this stake 12S dogs
were entered from different parts of
the country and the event resulted in
some of the greatest trials of young
hounds ever held.
One of the best betting events of the
season will take place at Ingleside
Coursing Park when Doreen and Lily
Wright are to hook up in a match
race for the best three out of five
courses. These fleet dogs have met on
several occasions, each dog gaining a
victory over the other, and it has be
come a toss up as to which hound is
the better. The owner of each hound
is so sanguine that his charge is the
one that a match for $100 a side was
made as the result and the association
added to the purse.
Any doubt about the relative merits
of the dogs should be removed after
Sunday, as three wins for either should
be a fair test. The hares at the pres
ent time are in such strong form that
excellent trials should result. The fol
lowing are the probable winners at
Union Park to-morrow:
On next Tuesday the committee of
arrangements will meet to receive bids
from managers of the different cours
ing parks relative to running the An
nual California Coursing Committee
stake. The park offering the best in
ducements will get the stake. This
stake will be run on August 14 and is
for the benefit of the committee. The
park that makes the largest offer for
this event will have full sway on that
day. The other parks will be closed
down, so that the event will prove a
financial success.
Among the dogs that are likely to be
entered are Barge, winner of the Grand
National Champion stakes; Pocatelli.
the fleet son of Emln Pasha: Richard
Anton, McVey; Sacramento Boy, twice
winner of the John Grace challenge
cup; Full Moon; Tom King, the Los
Angeles champion, and Palo A1U>.

whose record as a stake winner has

In England. Rector will represent G.

aire sporting man. The pick of the

be nominated.
The first big annual coursing event
of the year, the Ladies' Day Champion
stake, will be run at Union Coursinjr
Park Sunday. July 31. It is expected
that this event will bring out sixteen
of the fleetest hounds now In the run
ning. This stake is to be run under the
auspices of the Interstate Coursing
Club and the entrance fee is placed at
$25.

Wants Shares and Damages.
The Great Eastern Guaranty Com
pany yesterday comenced suit against
the Realty Investment Company for
S5000 damages for the wrongful with
holding of 26,000 shares of stock In
the latter corporation belonging to the
plaintiff. The ' investment company
was incorporated In 1902 for the pur
pose of doing a real estate business,
v.ith a capital of 50,000 shares valued
at $10 each, and the guaranty com
pany became the owner of 26,000
shares represented by certificate No.

shares was made on June 7 last, but it
was refused. Hence the demand for
damage* and the recovery of the
stock. William H. H. Hart is attorney
for the plaintiff corporation.

Advices â¢ from Independence Lake
would indicate' that the fishing there
this year is very poor.
Advices from the upper Sacramento
indicate that the stream is still high.
Colonel Keliehor, who is an expert in
such matters, is of the opinion that the
volume of water in the river is from
twelve to eighteen inches too high at
the, present time. The colonel, who is
at present at Castella, averages about
a dozen fair-sized. trout each night.
Judge Nusbaumer of Oakland, who
has a fishing lodge at Sweet Brier,
near Castella, Is pronounced the best
fisherman on the river. He is invari
ably successful. The trout areas plen
tiful in the river as ever, but they are
becoming wary and it requires an ex
pert, to get them out. ,'
Jim Loftus and a friend recently took
seventy-three brook trout out of Castle
Creek, some five miles from Castella. i

he says, and his arm and three ribs werÂ«

T. C. Kenniff*and his party are still
at the Country fClub and are living in
hopes that the- fishing will improve
there. ' The refuse from the paper mills
is- again being dumped in the creek,
and this is believed to have hurt the
fishing to a certain extent.
There seems to be more good fishing
in the Lake Tahoe region this year
than in any of â¢ the other streams and
brooks. Yesterday more than, 1000
pounds of trout were shipped to this
city from that 'vicinity. Most . of ' the
fish were of fairly good size, many of
them averaging away " above > the or

have attracted many, anglers from this
city, and several parties left- for there
during, the past week." â¢
Reports from Aptos, Capitola, Mon

The California circuit will open at
Pleasanton next Wednesday. Every
thing points to a very successful meet
ing. A side stake of $25 each has been i
arranged by those who have nomina
tions in the Pacific Breeders' Futurity
Btakcs for foals of 1904 to trot and
pace in 1907. T. J. Crowley, one of the '
directors of the Trotting Horse Breed
ers' Association, suggested this novel
feature and it has been christened the
Crowley stake. It will close August 1.
The Chamber of Commerce stake,
which is worth $5000 and is for pacers
of the 2:24 class, will be decided on
Monday, the first day of the Detroit
meeting. The California mare, China
Maid, is entered in this race and there
is an excellent chance for her to win
it. Baron Grattan, Ed Geers* entry,
has been looked upon as a "pipe" for
this event, but he hooked up against
China Maid last week at Columbus and
the beat him two, heats in 2:0S 1 ,i and
2:05 T ,i. the fastest heats ever paced by
any horse in its first race. The race
was one of those novelty affairs of
three heats, in which every heat is a
race by itself.
In the third heat Baron Grattan beat
the Maid by a nose in 2:0S*i and that
Â«nded the race. China Maid was bred
by Thomas Drais of Farmington, this
Htate, and picked out by "Farmer"
Bunch for Ho Yow, the former Chinese
Consul at San Francisco, whose ambi
tion to become a trotting horse owner
led to his recall to China. Before leav
ing he disposed of his horses for about
one-tenth their cost and China 'Maid
fell into J. M. Nelson's hands, who took
her East two years ago. She was turn
ed over to- Millard Sanders last winter,
but he does not drive her, as she wears
the hopples and Sanders absolutely re
fuses to drive a hoppled horse. China
Maid is driven in her races by J. Mc-
Laughlin. /
The California horses got most of the
money at Columbus last week, where
i he curtain raiser for the circuit waa
held. Among the winners were Judge
Greene, Blackthorn, China Maid, Stan-
Icy Dilloti and Consuela S, while second
money was .won by the McKinney
mare. Leta, twice, Ben F, Trilby Di
rect, Consuela S and Leonora. The
iccords gained during the meeting by
the winners from this State were:
China Maid, 2:05%: Judge Greene.
2:09*4; Stanley Dillon, 2:11Â»4; Black
thorn, 2:13*i. and Consuela S, 2:10?;.
Millard Sanders won two heats of the
2:08 pace at Columbus with Al Bock.
The time was 2:0SU and 2:08 and then
Charley de Ryder captured the third
with the California mare. Trilby Direct,
in 2:05U- This mare looks like a 2:04
performer this year.
It looks very much as If the first big
trotting classic of the year, the famous
M. and M. $10,000 stake for horses of
the 2:24 class will be won by a Cali
fornia bred horse. Stanley Dillon is
the name of the trotter that is now a
J)ig favorite for the race and his per
formance at Columbus last week,
where he took a record of. 2:11 % In
i he third heat of his first appearance
in public, has caused him to be picked
as the probable winner of Detroit's
j-reat annual event.
Stanley Dillon is a bay gelding: by
Sidney Dillon, sire of that wonderful
mare, Lou Dillon, that holds the
world'* champion record of 1:5S%. He
was sold at the Blue Ribbon sale at
Cleveland last year with other horses
consigned by the Santa Rosa Stock
Farm and brought but $560, J. H.
Brown of Detroit purchasing him and
vjrning hJm over to the great relnsman
Ed Geers to train. At Columbus last
veek, Geers started Stanley Dillon in
his first race. The gelding acted like
h well seasoned campaigner and made
it three straight. The first heat was In
2:15 a i. the second in 2:12H and the
third in 2:11*;.
The other horses on which last pay
ment in the M. and M. has been made
are: Allie Jay, Emma Hoyt, Lison
jero, Italia, Jolly Bachelor. Blackthorn,
Miss Rosedale, Ruth C, Bessie Birch
wood. Miss Gay and Miss Jeannette.
Of these Lisonjero, Italia and Black
thorn are California bred. Lisonjero
was bred at Palo Alto and is by Dex
ter Prince. He has trotted a mile in
2:13^i this year. Italia is a mare by
Zombro ana" pulled a wagon in 2:11*4 in
a matinee race at Cleveland. Black
thorn is by Hawthorne. He won' at
< 'olumbus last week, getting a record
of 2:13U- But while all these perform
ances are good and of M. and M. qual
ity. Stanley Dillon has shown so much
â¢ lass that he is looked upon as the one
most likely to annex the big end of the
Ftake. r

night until they ;-were hustled off to
bed at 10 o'clock; by watchful trainers.
The team arrived 'from Brighton this
afternoon all fit- to.'iriake the contest
of their lives at the Queens Club. Mike
Murphy says their chances of winning
are even. ?Â¦
Clapp and Schick agree in this opin
ion. It is conceded that the Americans
will win the sprint, hurdles, hammer
throw, one jump and possibly both,
but the result- seems to hinge upon the
quarter mile race, which promises to be
a terrific fight. Long and Daives and
Barclay are all phenomenally fast. The
Englishmen expect to win the mile,
half mile and two mile runs and one
jump, making the odd event of nine de
cisive. Â¦ - 'Â¦;â¢>Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ , - - v

AMERICAN ATHLETES READY
FOR THE ENGLISH CRACKS
In* the finals the Coronado was dis
abled in the second race. This made it
easy for the Apache, as the Coronado
was her only rival in the finals. The
Corofiado won the second section clev
erly, but met with hard luck in the
finals.
The regular Sunday races for the
pennant will be held to-morrow, , when

sport. If the same success is met with
to-morrow and next Sunday the new
rules will undoubtedly be adopted at
the next club meeting.
Under the new rules a boat drops out
after it loses three races. The old rules
made if necessary for a boat to finish
first or Becond in a heat to qualify for
the semi-finals, and first In the latter
to get aplace in the final. Collier's sys
tem divides the boats into sections. As
each boat loses three races it drops out
until Â¦ but one remains. In the
final race the winners of the sections
come' together and race until one has
lost three times. This certainly looks to
be a fair test, as any boat getting three
chances cannot set up the cry of "hard
luck" or "fluke."
Last Sunday William Boeckner's
Apache again carried off the honors.
The Apache is an old-timer and has
won many pennants for her owner. On
Sunday she made a remarkable record.
She won every race in which she par
ticipated and made the best time for
the day. Nearly all of the boats sailed
consistently. The wind was too strong
to make record time, but the time made
by the boats in the various races does
not vary much. In four out of five races
the Apache's time was between 3:40 and
3:50.
Collier's new racing rules governing
Sunday model yacht races were tried
last Sunday for the first time and were
voted a great success^by one and all.
The races were by far the best held up
to date and were run off on an average
of five to an hour. When Collier intro
duced his rules at the last meeting they
met with considerable opposition* It
was argued that it would take more
than a day to dispose of the pennant,
and the races, which had heretofore
given the yacht owners great pleasure,
would become irksome and kill : the

Tennis Players Drawn.
The Scottish bowling tournaments
are .progressing slowly and many
matches remain to be played In the
singles. About two matches are played
each Saturday afternoon. Many of
those entered in the tournament are
out of town for the summer and it i9
impossible- in most cases to get the
players together. In another month
the cracks will be home and some
lively â¢ tournament matches will ba
played. : - L?i <: â¢â¢ - a
Despite the absence of many clubi
members players appear to be as num
erous on Saturdays as heretofore. Tha
rinks are crowded all afternoon and
the players indulge in some lively
practice games. The green is in ex
cellent shape and the bowlers are be
coming very accurate.
' Many new players have taken ufl
the game and are learning It with sur
prising rapidity. Judge Lucien Shaw
is the latest embryo player and Is al
ready clever enough to hold up hia
end in a foursome with the best play
ers. John T. Dare is another novice
at the game who has come to the
front with a rush. Mr. Dare has ac
complished much since he took up the
game about a year ago.
Dr. Hamilton has not played the
game many years, but is considered
a top notcher. He has bowled won
derfully in the doubles and with tV.
R. Eaton as a partner Is expected to
win them. They have won a place in
the finals, although drawn in the hard
est half. Play will be resumed in the
singlas . to-day, but the doubles
matches will have to go over for tome
time.. , .

FAIR GROUNDS SELECTIONS.
CHICAGO.'JuIy 22.â Amusing inci
aents};were is the steeple
chase, the second and feature event of
a' poor card"' ; at' Hawthorne to-day, i
which Was wpn "by an extreme out
sider, Farthingale, at 30 to 1. Kins'
CJaJong, , at S to. 1, was second ami
Weirdthirct.after the latter had fallen
iand. hisrjocJtey remounted. Poorland3
and t Weird- were .the two choices, but
both â¢ fell;* while King Talius, the only
one left td race- for third, refused the
tenth, jump, i L. O'Brien made a dozen
futile efforts to get the old horse over,
as third was a' certainty if he would
only go -the rqute.\ Pemberton, who
rode Weird,' was lying on the ground at
the sixth jump, apparently badly in
lured, but his mount- had stopped close
by, and when he saw ..that King Tatius
would: not. Jump Jie remounted and fln
ishedjthird, five j minutes or more after
Farthingale and King Galong hadUeft
the Infield.
Americano turned a somersault form
reversal in the third race, which ap
parently was not unexpected by some
who backed him from 16 to 1 down to 9
to 1, despite the fact that he was beaten
oft! last a few days ago in the same
company.
To-day he simply ran away from his
field, leading "by six lengths into the
stretch and then, winning unextended.
"Big Bill" Knapp rode two winners.
Rain fell shortly after noon, making
the track slow and sticky. ~ The
weather was clear and warm and the
attendance light, effected by an early
rain, which fell about the time the
racetrack trains left the city. Sum

! <PUV6R'S $U\$ERr ..UNKNOWN. -r-qorpner
Xeland held an Ipqtfest yesterday upon" tna body
of Arth'uT Olfver, a'he'sro' pugitistv who QUid'on*
July 8 at ihe-Ontral Emergency .Hospital fÂ«j m
the effects of stabs received at the hands of a
soldier. The Jury Teturned'a Verdict that the
Identity of Oliver' s. slayer .was unknown.
Juicy steaks and Juicier prunes are
the big Items oa the bills of fare at
Eddie H&nlon's training quarters, Ala
meda. For breakfast the- small fighter
gets outside of a large cargo of the
fruit that has made California famous
and also stows away three soft boiled j
eggs and a pot of tea before he goes
tor his morning Journey on the road.
Eddie's usual lunch consists of roast
beef, browned potatoes, plenty of
wheat bread and fruit dessert. Steaks
form the larger part of the little fight
er's dinner and the way he devours
the fat ones after his work in the gym
r.aslum would make a champion canni
bal feel like a dyspeptic. Hanlon af
firms he can do two men's work masti
cating eirloins when he is right and
Trainer Frank McDonald corroborates
the statement.
Eddie has become an enthusiastic
swimmer and it is new his practice to
take a dip in the briny back of his
gymnasium every evening. With Fred
Landers, Toby Irwin, Joe Angeli and
McDonald, Hanlon has formed a water
polo team and will endeavor to make
the sport popular while he remains in
Alameda. Trainer McDonald, while
not a believer in swimming as a method
of developing a prizefighter, is not op
posed to Eddie taking a plunge when
he feelg that way. McDonald sagely
remarks that a bath occasionally will
do a boxer as much good as it does
other persons.
Hanlon was within a fraction of ISO
pounds yesterday after completing his
indoor work and being rubbed down.
He gparred four rounds with Irwin and
Landers and broke the ropes on both
his punching bags. Such an exhibi
tion of strength caused Trainer Mc-
Donald to threaten to put Hanlon to
driving "piles if his energy continued
to increase. ' \ \ â¢
Visitors who journeyed to Larkspur
yesterday in the hope of seeing Bat
tling Nelson work for his coming battle
with Eddie Hanlon, were sadly disap-
I-ointed as Battling and his crew took
a day off and climbed Mount Tamal
pais. The boys started at sunrise yes
terday morning, led by "Captain"
Metzner, and reached the summit in
two hours. This is remarkable time,
considering: that Battling had to- carry
the captain" the last half mile.
A i Peasant day was spent and the
hoys say the view from the mountain
surpasses anything ever seen by them.
Ted Murphy, Nelson's trainer and man
ager. Fays Battling is in the pink of
r.^ition and from now on will take
things easy.
Murphy has trained many fighters
and doesn't believe in working a man
too hard. Nelson is down to weight
and if necessary could enter the arena
weighing 127 pounds.
For the first time' since they struck,
the golden soil of Californiathi Seattle
tossers displayed a little of' thiir i abil
ity to slug the 'bah. Each man seemed
to be there yesterday-and;the. sphere
was Dinged good and hard. TheLrun,
getting was confined to two inningsâ
the first and the sixthâ and " in : these
two rounds enough tallies were made
to win 99 out of every 100 ball games.
Score: Seattle.7, Oakland 0. ,
It was almost painful to see the Com
muters swing wildly and vainly at the
offerings of Jay Hughes, j He had them
under the spell of his mysterious curves
in every Only,onÂ» chance did
Oakland have to score and then Hughes
possessed the luck* so Lohman's band
was sent to the woods beaten and out
classed.
The game was a clean one and well
played by both teams. Had it not been
so one-sided Â«t would have been inter
esting and worth witnessing. The work
of the infields on each side was rapid
and full of ginger. Mohler and Schlaf
ley made a couple of almost impossible
stops and little McKune put up a game
worthy of a Wg leaguer.
Seattle started right off in the first
round and ere a minute had elapsed
had scored over the pan. Van Haltren
hit the first ball pitched to short left
field and Mohler sacrificed. Delehanty
also bingled safely and Van Haltren
came in on Graham's wild pitch. Then
Frisk hit and \ Blankenship followed
suit, making it, three in a row. v
There was no scoring after that till
the sixth *vas~.at..ha'n<i. Seattle kept
hitting the ball hard and right ion the
nose, but Oakland fielded fast and ac
curately and,, therefore, many runs
were kept away from ; the plate when
it looked as though they were sUrely
due. ' . â¢ P
But Seattle began again in the sixth
and four runs were hammered over the
rubber in a twinkling. Hughes bingled
safely and Mohler sent him around to
third with a well placed drive to right.
Delehanty then turned loose and so
did Smith and Frisk, making it four
runs for the inning and seven for the
game. Hall lined a long fly out to cen
ter when Smith was on third, but the
latter was doubled at the plate on
Kruger's great throw. The score:

MUNROE AND BRITT ARRIVE.
Noted Pugilists Are Well Received in
the Eastern Cities.
Jack Munroe and Jimmy Britt -were
among the notables who arrived in
This city yesterday. Jimmy stepped
off the Owl .train from Los Angeles
this morning, looking real dapper. He
Â¦was met by a host of friends, who ten
dered him a reception worthy of a
prince. Munroe, accompanied by Tim
McGrath. arrived on the overland last
night, looking fine and dandy and glad
to be in San Francisco once again.
Munroe had a successful trip in the
East and says he is satisfied and ready
to>- Ftart training for Jeffries right
away. He announced that he prefers
Eddie Graney for referee and it now
looks as If the little blacksmith would
be the man. Jack has nothing bad to
say about Jeffries and adds that the
champion was not shamming. Mun
roe â¢will start training at the Beach
Tavern to-day.
Britt had a great tour through the
East. He made big money and friends
gralore wherever he went. He says if
Corbett violates his agreement and
tigns to fight again he, too, will do
likewise, but not for several months
at least, as he intends to take a good
rest. Jimmy will probably return East
next month to fill a theatrical engage
ment.
PERMIT FOR THE BIG FIGHT
STILL UNSIGNED BY MAYOR
NEW PITCHER IS EASY' MARK.
Hitt Is Batted Hard by the Harris
Aggregation.
LOS ANGELES, July 22. â Morley
tried out amateur Pitcher Hitt against
San Francisco this afternoon arid he
lasted a little longer than one inning.
The visitors hammered him for five
runs in the first and had two men on
bases when Wheeler went into the box
in the second. "Wheeler pitched a re
markably strong game and blanked
the visitors for the- remaining -eight
innings. The game was notable for
the number of long hits made by the
locals and the fact that none of them
figured in the score. Cravath made a
phenomenal catch in , right field.

Prize and Executive Refuses
to Interfere.
Rival Clubs Are Warring Over the
The permit granted by the Board of
Supervisors to the Yosemite Club to
pull off the JefTries-Munroe fight next
month is still unsigned by Mayor
Schmitz. It was announced yesterday
that if the Mayor did not sign the per
mit by to-day it would become void.
Schmitz, however, denies this and says
the permit holds good without his sig
nature.
The Yosemite and the Hayes Valley
clubs are still at war over the permit.
Schmltz says he will leave it to the
managers of the rival organizations to
Kettle their difficulty and when that Is
done he will siÂ«:n the permit. It is
probable that Managers Levy and
Coffroth will reach some kind of an
agreement within the next few days.
BECK'S HOMER, BEATS TIGERS.
Roach Has Taconia on His Staff
Throughout the Game.
PORTLAND, Or., July 22.âPort
land won the game from Tacqma to
day by the score of 2 to 0, largely be
cause of Beck's hit that sailed over
the infield, passed Lynch and tired out
only as it hit the fence, making: a
home run. McCreedie's single helped
pome, too. For five and a half In
nings the score boy dealt out g'oose
eggs for both sides. Then McCreedie
made trouble by a third safe drive.
Drennan died. Beck drove between
left and center fields. Lynch missed
it and when Beck was close to third
threw the ball to Eagan and not to
the home plate. So Beck started
again and though Eagan â¢ threw to
Sheehan at third the ball hit the
grandstand as Beck was coming home
tn triumph. . ...
The Tigers could not bunch .their
hits on Roach and the Portland twirl-.
er had the visitors on the home
stretch all along. Only five scattering
hits off him went through the infield

DARKNESS EXDS. GREAT.
THIRTEEN INNING GAME
Harry Chester showed cleverness and
clean fighting in his bout with George
Curry and won the decision, but he
lacked the strength to make a unanim
.ous verdict by a. knockout.
Joe Kelly won; the decision over
George Henry in the opening bout.
The "battle royal," participated in
by four negroes, failed of success be
cause the supply of soda water bottles
among, the spectators .was insufficient
to keep the contestants on their feet.
Jim Sweeny bunched up against a
hard chunk of wood when he tried to
cut Young Choynskl down. .Sweeny
was so bad in the third round, that
Greggains mercifully stopped the fight
and gave the decision to Choynski.
k.*Jim Hill, who is listed as a Victoria,
B.;C., 'pugilist, furnished the comedy
element; of . the night. . \ Evidently, he
-mistodkV the terms of hii*^ agreement
and signed for a fight wherihe wanted
to go ori as a ballet dancer. His mo
tions were, so ' unique and his smile so
captivating that Harry Tenney stalled
"for the first round; fearing he had been
plotted - against.- In the ; second , it t was
curtains. for Jim .Hill. He got so way
ward in his think-tank about'the mid
dle of the second that ; his seconds
tossed his multi-colored bath robe into
the ring to \ save him , from instant
death. Experts claim that an old wom
an could put him, out with a wet sock.
Mike Synfy and Charlie Dunn gave a
splendid exhibition for four rounds.
Synfy was much the cleverer, but Dunn
did all the forcing, and although put
down twice made a flying finish in the
last and had the Greek going. The de
cision was a draw.
The special event 'between Dick Hy
land and Jimmy McDonald, who fought
at feather-weight/ Was rather disap
pointing,; .HylanoV was', touted as the
goods and he secured the decision right
fully. At the same; time he was obliged
to ' do more -Â¦ sprinting than fighting.
McDonald started once toward North
Beach tjor a get-away, and Hyland fol
lowed him nearly three times around
theiring before he could manage to hit
him on the shoulder. He could have
saved four valuable seconds if he had
started in the opposite direction and
met his opponent coming the other way.
Seven events'constituted the monthly
exhibition of amateur of. the
San -Francisco Athletic Club -at Wood
ward's Pavilion last, night. , As a-gen
era) thing, the show.- jwas worth twice
the price of- admissioni ;and . what it
laoked in a 'sfjn*e" .was;ampiy
made up in 'litfipprpua ."situations:'' Even
AJex Greg^in's.^whoXwaa* the*: 'official
referee, as usual,; smiled at some of the
funny stunts.-; The attendance was
large, packing the galleries and occu
pying more than two-thirds of the
downstairs Â¦ seats.. Captain Anderson
personally supervised the police con
trol and saw that ticket, holders were
promptly admitted and properly seated.
The best event. of the evening was be
tween Johnny Crowe, champion ama
teur bantam-weight of the coast, and
Harry McCloiid, who is known as the
"Little Sharkey." , A gamer kid than
the ; latter never rubbed rosin â¢â¢ on his
shoes. He was bested from the begin
ning by Crowe, but'' he clung to the
game until one., minute before the call
of time in the" fourth round, when a
"well-delivered "uppercut on the jaw
turned him completely around, and he
fell j into Greggains*' arms, completely
out. This was the only actual knock
out that was scored.

These are the genuine "WORLD'S FAIR" Toothpicks, put up in handsomely engraved
and polished boxes., -The engraving is in colors, directly on the wood (not a label), and the
l boxes are hand polished in the natural color of the wood, thus displaying to the best advantage
thefine grain of the silver white birch from which they are made. In a word,' it makes a very
artistic package, and the most attractive novelty of this kind, yet produced. -
â¢ The "WORLD'S FAIR" Toothpicks themselves are so familiar as to hardly need de*
scription â they are rounded, polished and sliverless, and admittedly the finest and most popular
American pick on the market, and are sold in every section of this country.

**" ' i .Â¦
The above cut is fac-simile of the package and exact size of box. The cover is engraved
in red and black, and as the cut reads. The box has a very neat appearance, and is filled 'with
about 300 of these popular, high-class toothpicks. When empty box makes a very suitable re-
ceptacle for hairpins, cuff, collar buttons, etc., and is a valuable and ornamental addition to any
dresser. The premiums are free to Want Advertisers in Sunday Call only. Gifts given Thurs-

ing what kind of property you prefer In ex-
change, and you will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result..

BUTTE, Mont., July 22. â With a
right hook to the jaw in the fifth
round, Jimmy Gardner of Lowell
Mass., to-night gave Willie Fitzgerald
his quietus, his seconds throwing up
the sponge after their man had been
knocked down vfour times In two
rounds, and he was taking the count
for the full number. Fitzgerald was
helpless and, to save his man from
further punishment, Harry Pollok
threw up the sponge.
Fitzgerald was outclassed to-night in
al! stages of the fight, and though he
displayed great cleverness, he was no
match for the Lowell lad, who went at
him hammer and tongs, simply beating
his man down. Gardner's work to
night was a pretty exhibition, his
agility in evading the vicious rushes
and jabs of Fitzgerald eliciting much
applause.
' The men fought at catch weights
Gardner entering the ring about 140,
while Fitzgerald weighed about 138.

BERLIN, July 22. â Arguments in
the trial of Socialists at Koenigsberg
for using Germany as a base for al
leged treasonal acts against the Rus
sian Government began to-day. The
State's Attorney dropped the charge
of lese majeste committed against the
Emperor of Russia because he said he
assumed the accused had not known
that some of the smuggled documents
contained the language which it was
proved In court they did contain, but
he maintained the charge of high
treason and membership in a secret
association, arguing that the high
treason charge must be upheld since
the Russian Embassador at Berlin ex
pressly pledged his word that Russia
practiced reciprocity with Germany In
prosecuting cases of high treason. The
State's Attorney, however, moved for
light sentences on the nine accused
men, ranging from one to six months'
imprisonment for secret association
and two to twelve months' detention
in a fortress for high treason.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The foreign markets stood about
the same. Chicago was lc lower. .The Chi
cago wire of Mitchell, Mulcahy &Co. said:
"There was rather- more pacific political
news" from Europe. - and scattered showers >
through the West and Southwest were 'light. I
Receipts Of wheat were again liberal and de- j
mand not so good, and . cash prices in the
Southwestern markets lo to 2c . lower. The |
war news had, as usual, driven out the short |
interest to a great extent. There, was some
ecattered liquidation throughout the day.
Snow's report was considered bearish, although
he estimates the crop from 600,000,000 to 625,
000,000 bushels, which, is not very high for
him. The Modern Miller was also considered
a little bearish. Northwestern advices continue
favorable. Late cables confirm a serious short
age In the French crop, but with the large
surplus they carried over last ' year It seems '
doubtful if they will need to Import much If
any wheat. We still look for an uncertain and
fluctuating market. The large cash premiums
will, we think, continue to bring the wheat
from fanners' hands and some depreciation in
cash prices would seem probable. This may tem
porarily depress September and December wheat,
although we doubt if the cash level reaches the
basis of those futures for some time to come.
Threshing returns are disappointing. Inclined
to think we would still operate on the long side,
but for the present buy on sharp breaks for
moderate profits."
The Cincinnati Price Current says 30.000,000
bushels is* a conservative estimate of the re
cent Western wheat losses. ; Â¦
The Southwestern Grain and Flour Journal
which estimated the Kansas wheat crop at" 70- I
000,000 bushels May 15, on last Friday gave
that State 60.000.000 bushels. Nebraska is esti
mated at 31.000,000 bushels, Oklahoma 14,
000,000 bushels.- and the three States 106,000 -
000 bushels. . . . . '
In this market there was little new. The
cash grain was steady and unchanged, while
futures sold off ln sympathy with Chicago.

Provisions.
{ CHICAGO. July 22.â Under the Influence of
comparatively weak cables and Improved
! weather conditions there was heavy selling of
wheat at the opening. Initial quotations were
at a considerable decline, September being
down %@%c to %Â®%<S at SS%c to SSVic. The
lower prices brought out a liberal demand
from pit traders, causing a fair advance, Sep
tember going up to SS%@SSftc within the first
fifteen minutes of trading. The bullish senti
ment, however, eoon gave way to weakness as
a result of a number of bearish crop advances.
I The report of a local crop expert and that of a
1 St. Louis' trade Journal there were favorable
1 for a good harvest. The fact that the arrivals
of new wheat aro on the increase and that tho
demand for the cash article is on the wane
accentuated the declining tendency. Foreign
advices also were of a less pessimistic tenor,
departments of the day ! tending to dissipate
) all fears of anglo-Russian complications. The
volume of trading was not eo heavy ae It has
been recently. Largo houses that have been
liberal purchasers offered only moderate sup
port. As the session advanced prices continued
to decline until Spptember had reached 87%c.
A flight rally occurred before the close "on
-covering by shorts. Final figures on,Septem
ber were at BTKOCTftc. July sold between 94c
and OCc and closed at 94%c Â¦ -
The break in wheat and estimates for lib
eral receipts to-morrow were.. re.si>pnslble . for
a weak corn market. The market closed at a
trifle above the low point. September opened
a ehado to UfUc lower at 49%c to 49%c, sold
down to 4i>l*iC and closed at 49Â»4<g-49i4c.
Influenced by the weakness of other grains
sentiment in the oata 'pit was bearish. Sep
tember opened MCMc lower at 33%@33%c
; ranged, between 32%c and 33%c and closed at
I Â«&Hc.
i. me resumption of the strike at the stock
j yards dominated trading in â¢ provisions. The
Â¦ volume of business was extremely light and
I prices showed only slight change*. Liberal
j receipts of hogÂ» and lower prices at the yards
\ were bear factors. September pork closed with
; Â« loss of 5c. lard also was down 5c and ribs
were off 7%c.

"i New York Stock Market.
Â» NEW YORK. July 22. â The stock market
? was duller and more sluggish In tone to-day
L than for a long time pa;t. Add to this the ex
t cossivo irregularity of the movement all the
. day and the 'ntire uncertainty of the specula
, tive mood will be understood. The firm under
, tone which has continued manifest since the
I hf-sitation in the advance first developed was
, | still ixrctptible. This was partly due to the
j sustaining influence of a number of str&ng
features in Cie market. The crisis in the re
, lations b.-:ween the British and Russian gov
, ernments has oil influence on all markets, and
may be expected to have until it is definitely
i disposed of. Our wheat market was under the
! Sfrn'r 0 !" 1 ,^ Question, but shared with the
â¢ tRaivr weather in the Southwest, which ulti
mately weakened wheat. The opening advance
str.ke. The discontent among the New England
cotton workers and rumors that threatened
trouble among operatives displeased with the
treaHMRt gave the labor quegtlon some added
influence upon the sentiment. The argument
v â¢f,V 1 Â» , r< l. that *. hc I"^""^ of the Russian

rr.lKht bring it into touch with some American
wer shipments for Jai)an. The Pacifies and
. ht. I aul resr at one time. The demonstration
! in these was not very convincing, and the ad
, vances were not held. The forecast of the
currency movement indicated that no effect
nay been produced in the street by the re
v.val of business In the Interior With the
gam on subm-asury operations an Increase in
cash reserves is indicated In an amount up
, wards of S'j.OW.OWf. Rates for call loans in
dicate a redundancy of day-to-day funds But
the time loan market is called steady. Foreign
exchange also advanced again to-day In re
epons.? to the hardening discount market in
London. A la.t* :irofit taking movement left
little of the day'fc gain, but the closing was
telrly steady.
Bonds weie irregular. Total sales, par value

Forty blocks in the Potrero, bo it Is
currently reported, are about to pass
from the Potrero Land and Water
Front Company to a new owner. Rumor
says the party to come into possession
is the Western Pacific Railway Com
pany and that the. land is to be used
for a San Francisco terminal. Another
rumor is that the Southern Pacific
Company is back of the Impending
large transfer. Mr. fBartnett of the
Western Pacific Railway is out of the
city.
Southern Pacific officials pretend
ignorance of the "negotiations.
The forty blocks, are partly on the
slope back of the rope walk and partly
in the bay, extending as far south as

"It is always Interesting: to trace the growth
and spread of any custom affecting nations,
and I have devoted some attention to the beer
drinking habit. The German Immigration to
this country first created a demand for beer,
and its Importation was heavy. American
brewers kept improving their processes all the
time and Anally the Americans began to like
the drink. To-day our Importation of beer Is
almost nil. and we make beer that will com
pare with any In the world. .Take the A. B. C.
Beer cf thÂ« American Brewing Company of
St. Louis, for instance. There is a beer, made
from the finest grade of hops and the choicest
barley malt, that is not equaled by any beer
made. Science and every sanitary precaution
enter Into Us make, thÂ« result being a bever
age that is not only absolutely pure, but Is at
the fame time palatable and highly nutritious.
It pocÂ«estes all the essential qualities of a
perfect beer. It Is the only beer that does
possess all these qualities, because It is the
only beer bottled exclusively at the brewery
by Its makers. It Is the work and methods of
such brewers aa the American Brewing Com
pany that has given American beers the com
manding position they now hold." .:â¢'â¢

Henry P. Conradl's family picnic on
the beach near the Cliff House on July
26, 1902, had an ending in the home
coming which he believes warrants
him in commencing suit in the Su
perior Court' against the United Rail
roads for $20,000 damages. Conrady.
who is a builder and contractor, and
five of his offspring dallied with the
surf and lolled in the sand at the pop
ular point where the Pacific moans
music to the dunes. After a day of
enjoyment the father and his flock
boarded one of the company's cars to
be conveyed to the corner of Frederick
and Stanyan streets. He declares that
he instructed the conductor to let
them off at the corner, but the trol
ley still buzzed at full speed. They
were riding on the dummy. It Is not
related that Conrady pulled the string
connected with the mechanism of the
conductor's register, but he, says he
pulled a rope to signal the car to stop
at the next corner and Immediately
thereafter he was smashed in the face
by the collector of fares. The assault
was so vigorous that, according to the
complaint, Conrady was knocked from
the car while It was going at high
speed. The plight of the" parent so
frightened the children that they Im
mediately tumbled from the dummy.
The father does not allege that any of
the infants were hurt, but avers that
he was so injured about the head that
he was prevented from attending to
his business and Is still unable to do
justice to his work. Therefore the
damages in the sum of $20,000 are de
manded.

PRETTY AND POPULAR LITTLE
DANCER WHO WILL AGAIN BE
SEEN AT FISCHER'S THEATER.
The decision was written by Chief
Justice Beatty, with whom Justices An
sellotti, Shaw and an Dyke directly
concur. Justice McFarland writes a
concurring opinion, in which, however,
he dissents from the view that the
Southern Pacific did give practically
the same service for the lower rate.
A substantial lowering of the rates should
net be a.Ufwed to pass unehall>Â»nged under the
disguise of limited tickets, and. on the other
hand, a corc>onuion which' merely meets a
lower rate trevlously established by a cora
rÂ«*.lngr carrier rhould not be held to have low
ered it* rates for the purpose of competition
Â¦within the true meaning of that expression.
V.'e think the Judgment and order of the
Superior Court should be affirmed, not be
cause the rate was not lowered but because
It was not lowered for the purpose of compe
tition within the proper construction of the
constitution.
It wÂ»Â« no cart of their design to punish a
corporation for merely lowtrtn* its rates in
Felf-defense, â¢ â¢ â¢ And that la all that the
Southern Pacific Corajjany is found to have
done In this instance. It iÂ» the corporation
which lowers its rates for the purpose of d*
rtroyir.g a rival tnat is the proper subject of
the penalty imposed by the constitution. â¢ â¢ â¢
DKAWS DISTINCTIONS.
Fcr the reasons and upon the ground stated
*.<? hold that the defendant, tj*: Southern Pa
cific CortiDany, did lower its Tate from $5 90
to J ; T5 within the meaning of the constitu

the people who adopted it had In view cr had
â¢my desire to punish. The whole object of the
provision was to foster legitimate competition
by preventing destructive competition. â¢ â¢ "
The court dissects the argument of the
railroad and holds that it is faulty. The
"limited" ticket gave first-class service,
but was good only on the day of sale,
g-ave no stop-over privileges and im
posed cor.ditions as to the amount of
baggage and the method of checking
it. The court says that in form the
railroad did not lower its $5 90 rate,
but as nineteen out of every twenty
persons traveled first-class on the "lim
ited" tickets and as all essential privi
leges were secured therewith, the fare
was really established for purposes of
competition.
On this point the court says:
DENIES COMPANY'S CLAIMS.
The company claimed that it had
never lowered its regular rate for the
transportation of passengers, and that
even if such had been the case the law
cited was in violation of the fourteenth
amendment to the constitution of the
United States. While the Southern Pa
ciSc maintained its 53 75 fare on "lim
ited" tickets it continued to charge
55 SO for an alleged different service.
"When the fight was over and the old
rate had been restored the company in
eisted that it had simply discontinued
an inferior service.
The Commissioners based their peti
tion on section 20. article XII, of the
constitution, which says:
Ar.d whenever a railroad corporation shall,
lor the imrjK-o c f competing n-lih any other
<Â«jnracn carr f lower its rates for transpor
tation cf Â»;as. .igi-rs- or freight from one point
to another, tuch reduced rates will net be
rjrain raised cr increased from euch standard
Â¦without the conrent of the governmental
authorities in which shall be vested the power
to reculatc far:s and freights.
In July. 1Â£9S. the San Francisco and
San Joaquin* Valley Railroad Company
had tracks .from Fresno to Stockton.
By arrangement with an Independent
line of steamers a through passenger
pervice was established from Fresno to
San Francisco and the fare was fixed
at $3 75. The Southern Pacific had a
rate of $5 90 for the trip from San
Francisco to Fresno, but on July 18,
189S, the fare oa "limited" tickets was
reduced to $3 75.
"When the rival road went out of ex
istence as an independent line the Rail
road Commission petitioned for an in
junction to prevent the Southern Pa
cific from increasing the rate again.
The Superior Court decided in favor of
the commission and the Supreme Court
reversed that decision. At the second
trial the Superior Court refused to
gTant the injunction sought by the com
mission, and the Supreme Court this
lime sustains the lower tribunal.
CONSTITUTION IS CITED.
The famous Fresno rate case was
decided in favor of the Southern Pa
cific Company yesterday by the Su
preme Court. Ii is held that the rail
road did not reduce the fare for pas
sengers In violation of the constitu
tion, as was alleged by the State Rail
road Commission. The law, it is said,
vras not obeyed literally, but the in
tent of its franiers was not disregard
ed. The dispute lias been In the courts
for about five years. The action was
begun by the Stale board to secure an
injunction against an increase in rates.
Argument of Commissioners
Based on the Law, Which
Is Held to Be Inappli
cable to Facts Alleged
She pleaded with him to get a cheap
coat and hat somewhere, but he would
not. He said he wanted to teach her a
never to be forgotten lesson on the
practical uses of memory. She argued
wiih him â told of the spectacle he
would make at home â but he said he
was willing to sacrifice his social stand
ing if he could make her remember not
to forget.
So that is why Dr. Cockrill of Peta
luma went home in his composite dress
with Mrs. Cockrill by his side, half
dead from mortification.
Then she locked the door and hurried
away â the note in the bedroom and
the key in the hall.
Smooth-faced and rosy-cheeked from
his ehave, the doctor came bounding
up the back stairs and found â or rather
he didn't findâ Mrs. Cockrill and the
way Into the room. Here was a pretty
mess. The door was strong â strong as
some of the language he used. The
agent was afar, so his key was not
available, and the time was flying. He
must be at home that forenoon, and
moreover he had no breakfast, but he
could waive that. "Worse still,, his
pocketbook with his money was in the
room, though Mrs. Cockrill had her
own purse.
Nothing else to be done, he went
down to the barber and borrowed a
white jacket, red silk handkerchief
and carfare to the ferry â he would
breakfast in Petaluma. He was' an en
tertainment to the passengers on the
street car, who took him for a street
faker, and a source of worry to the
conductor, who whispered to the motor
man that they had a runaway crazy
aboard.
At the ferry he burst on Mrs. Cockrill,
who almost collapsed when that white
coat and red headgear showed up. The
harbor police came near arresting him
on suspicion of being an escaped luna
tic, but Mrs. Cockrill Interceded.
There is a shop immediately under
the flat which he had patronized sev
eral times â the proprietor of which
is a jolly, skillful, talkative
artist of the tonsorial guild. So, without
vest, coat or hat the doctor hurried
down the back stairs and through the
rear door of the barber's place and
dropped into a chair.
Mrs. Cockrill, up in the room pre
paring for departure, suddenly thought
of a package at a Market-street store
which must be procured before * they
left the city. She did not know where
the doctor was getting his shave. Time
was a premium, for ferry-boats, like
clocks and tides, wait for no one.
She must hurry away, but the
chamber door must not be left open,
as half of the doctor's wearing apparel,
with pockets filled with valuables, was
there. So she hastily wrote a note for
him. She said she would leave the
door key on the hat rack in the hall
and was careful to leave the written in
formation in a conspicuous place on the
bed, where he would find it when he
got into the room. She forgot that he
would not get the note or know how to
get into the room.
The Petalumans had been visiting
here for a week, occupying the flat of
friends who are now in the East, con
sequently the doctor and his wife had
the house to themselves. Early yester
day morning they arose and made
preparations to return home, intending
to eat breakfast downtown on their
way to the ferry. The doctor suddenly
remembered that he needed a shave,
and, not wishing to appear before his
Petaluma neighbors with an Esau-like
phiz, determined to seek a barber.
Dr. M. B. Cockrill, a well-known
physician of Petaluma, made the trip
home from" this city yesterday morn
ing In a costume that was a cross be-,
tween that of a waiter and a pirate.
Mrs. Cockrill was in a state of nervous
prostration from looking at him in his
odd habiliments. The big policeman
at the ferry almost collapsed when he
saw the composite appearance of the
doctor â but that is another story.
The suicide was born in Austria,
but most of his life was spent in this'
city.. He acquired a knowledge of
stenography and , typewriting at a lo
cal business school and entered into
the employ of Keithly five years ago.
He was a conscientious employe.
While a boy he met with a distressing
accident which necessitated the am
putation of his right leg below the
knee joint. Although he wore an ar
tificial limb most of his acquaintances
did not know' that he was permanent
ly crippled.
The family was too greatly prostrat
ed yesterday to make any announce
ment of the funeral arrangements.
Investigation developed that. Braun
was employed by E. A. Kelthly, an
agent of an Eastern firm selling
plumbers' supplies, who has offices in
the Rialto building. Keithly is absent
in the East. Braun was nominally
bookkeeper, but he temporarily man
aged the affairs of his employer.
On the body was found a copy of a
letter addressed to Eraun's employer
at a Chicago address lamenting in
strong terms the fact that Braun had
made a quotation for certain goods
below the accepted price. According
to the other employes in the office the
difference could not have amounted to
more than $150. Apparently the young
man sent the letter to his employer, of
fering to him for any loss
and for' three weeks has anxiously
been awaiting an answer. In pencil
on the back of the letter were deci
phered the words "Glad to die, so
don't worry." Yesterday he appeared
at the office shortly before the usual
time, opened the mail and not finding
any comforting reply from his em
ployer, went to his death.
Young Braun resided with his fam
ily, consisting of father, mother and
brother, at 384 Fourteenth street. The
father, Jacob Braun, is a route car
rier for two local papers. According
to him there was no cause for his
son's suicide ejxcept that he had evi
dently been perturbed in mind for
three weeks ar.d for a week had been
unable, to sleep. Neither he nor the
family nor any of the employes in the
office knew that a misquotation in the
price of goods had been made.
Disheartened by a mistake that
meant a loss of about $150 to his em
ployer, Carl Braun, a native of Aus
tria and aged 22 years, plunged into
the waters of the bay at 9 o'clock yes
terday morning from the Fillmore
street wharf. One hour later his body
was recovered.
W. S. Rogers, who lives at Devisa
dero and* Beach streets, saw a well
dressed young man dive into the wa
ter. He went to the rescue and waited
with a long pole to draw the man to
safety. The body did not reappear
and Rodgers secured the assistance
of W. J. Hickey and Matt Larsen, two
boatmen, who grappled for an hour
about the spot where the young man
sank and finally secured the body. On
his person Deputy Coroner Brown
found a watch engraved with the
name "Carl Braun."
Improper letters from women, who
signed only their Christian names "to
the clandestine correspondence, form
the basis of a suit for divorce com
menced yesterday by Jessie Ponton de
Arce against Stanley Ponton de Arce,
a salesman employed by Sussman,
"Wormser & Co., wholesale grocers. The
wife declares that her husband sends
"loving, intimate and improper letters"
to other women, and in their replies
they apply toward him the most en
dearing terms and indicate conditions
contrary to the sanctity of the mar
riage relation. He is said to have a
picture of one of the corespondents in
dorsed "Toujours Fidele," which is in
terpreted in the complaint as meaning.
"Always faithful or loving." A pic
ture of another woman is said to rep
resent one "almost nude."
*Mr&. de Arce declares that the sales
man is in receipt of an income of $300
IMPROPER MISSIVES,
TV. TV. Davidson, whose principal
practice iri the courts is in obtaining
decrees for other, people, was recently
sued for divorce by his wife, Nellie,
who charged him with mistreatment
and failure to provide. Yesterday he
filed an answer,' in which he not only
denies her accusations, but charges
that she deserted him in 1901. They
were married at Petaluma in Ifc79. Da
vidson goes further in his answer and
admits that his -income is more than
$300 a month and that he is able to pro
vide for his wife's wants. He says, too,
that they have lived under the same
roof ever since they were marrie^, and
recites that he furnished their, parlor
at a cost of J1200, the remainder of the
residence in proportionate style.
In conclusion Davidson declares that
he is willing to condone his wife's de
sertion, take her back and assure her
that he will treat her with kindness.
He will do more â he will open a" bank
account for her in any bank in this
city that she may select, give her a
passbook and. checkbook and deposit
$100 a month to her credit, if she ac
cepts the offer.
It develops that a divorce lawyer,
himself a defendant in a suit for di
vorce, knows how to show husbands
â¢accused of cruelty and neglect the
proper way for preventing a judicial
severance of marital ties.'

skirt made very fulL It's in the new English slate color; the coat has
a velvet collar. It's as plain as a maxr's suit and just as stylish- Then
there is a brown mixture at $22.50, but we. won't try to tell of every
style. We want you to see them. ~ : :.-, : v
