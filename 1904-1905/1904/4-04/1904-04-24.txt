The Sunday Call Magazinewbere, and In danger?. I could not have 4
â¢believed . those words from any other
lips than those which uttered them. I
would have left that dais for no, other
man on earth than Oranoff. The cur
tains came together. I knew he was a
Â¦ man ; of few words, and the retreating
footsteps were his. "If. you love her!"
I hurried after him.
I had not seen Dulcine'a father since
I marched before the King and virtu
ally. told a lie by failing to tell the
truth. I had heard, him speak to Dul
cine; across my bed when she told the
lie I acted, but I looked only at her. I
tried to believe he had sought her in the
British] Legation party, and. missing
her^had come tome. But his few
words iiriplied that he knew where she
was. : : His face showed he was crazed
with j grief.
â I attempted to overtake him, but I
qulckly.perceived he did not desire this,
for We 'Â¦ regulated his paces with mine
and'remained in; the lead. We passed
around the mound. "Now I saw he also
took the precaution- not to be recog-' 1
rilzed by others' and carried himself pe
culiarly,: "one shoulder being carried
higher â¢ than . another. I 'dumbly fol
lowed! his example, thinking of nothing
. save . the .'danger which had come to
Dulcine. -WKh this fear in my heart I
seemed bereft of every sense.
At length we reached, the soldiers,
and Oranoff chose one of the darker
avenues ; or spaces between the com
panies and passed swiftly through the
stacks of burnished rifles and- out into
the gloom beyond I could now see the
dim forms of several persons beyond
us. There were ponies with them.
Now. and not until now did I in the
least doubt that I was folo wing Colonel
Oranoff, .blinded as I was by my/awful
fears. I looked again upon those shoul
ders, and suddenly the scales fell from,
my eyes. : \ - â.
It was the man of the crippled shoul
ders..; Menln had caught me at last! * /.
I .But even as I turned and reached to
my side, a blow on the, head from some,
one who" was silently following felled^
me to the ground. Â¦Â¦
â¢ â¢ â¢
The : sun was rising when again I
opened; my eyes. the. torture
of the cords which .bound me" to the
pony hastened the return of conscious
ness. .For -a >moment'I-gazed blankly
'into the valley from which we were
climbing,- just, as the sun '.was gilding
the /crest 1 bC the,, far-off, rocks. Below
was ": Keinriing. \ the valley .of, the Phan,

through' the fbg.Vlt' ran along the cliffs
like, a' roll.of ;tiny/ drums. At last the
beat; themselves. to 'death on the
'rocksTand/ dropped ' lifeless at their base.
The 'sound > was as' though a gigantic
hanirner,had struck a mountain. cliff. It
chilled, the blood '-'In/- my > veins, and
started^my ; staggering 1 brain/; from its
. drearaingitv- reason ; returned.
'/The; great* tablet" had "dropped forever
. upon the royal i- mausoleum, "burying
Dulcirie' Oranoff. "within It, alive!' '
"Cherum!" he exclaimed in the ver
nacular. "He worships in the mourn
ing chamber until the march to the
tomb, captain."
I moved impatiently. ; S-. .
/'Can you get my name to one of the
eusuchs of the mourning chamber?"
"I can do that" the man answered.
He took it and left Since the King had
deigned to recognise and counsel me in
the throne room, I did not believe he
would refuse me a hearing at this
time.
Nor was I wrong, for in a few mo
ments the man returned and beckoned'
me to follow.
I went on through a maze of smaller
rooms, being conducted by one official
after another, each more elaborately
dressed than the other, until a last door
was opened from within.
I entered, and there stood the King.
When he saw me he turned and waved
his hand behind him, and two female
inmates of hie household went giggling
into a further room. The place was
thick with cigarette smoke.
Z2ius Whang-Su worshiped in the
mourning chamber during the last
hours before the imperial funeral!
Yet the King's eyes grew serious as
he bade me enter, and I knew he had
not thought I asked audience for
nothing. I decided before I saw him to
come straight to the point There was
little time In which to make changes,
however great the dispatch.
"Sire, is the trail of earth to be laid
through the West Gate?"
believe so," he answered blandly.

To this he nodded, while he drew at
his cigarette. "What!" he then cried
through a cloud of Emoke; "you
laughed at my fears in the throne room
and boasted of our strength." He saw
my point quickly, at least!
I did not tell him what I thought It
waj another kettle of fish now that I
knew who was in that golden sarcoph
agus.
"But strong as we are, sire, is it not
foolhardy to tempt Prince Tuen un
necessarily?"
Then I told the King of the situation
in the Chinese quarter and of DeJnefTs
plan. He seized upon that instantly.
"The ruse is good, and it is all we
can do; the old palace is on the road to
the Little Gate." he added; and I real
ized that he could not order the f uner-
Involuntarily I pushed through the
crowd* to the King's antechamber and
asked a passing eunuch for the King.
He pointed me to another eunuch who
understood English.
"He is in the mourning chamber," the
latter replied.
"I must see him," I said with a sig
nificant gesture. â
I knew something, now, of Tuen's
desperation â aye, more than any living
man. And Dulcine's life was at stake!
Then suddenly he answered as though
he had not spoken a word before:
"Now. Martyn, I don't like this more
than you; but it's too late to change
the orders. This circus is a mighty big
affair, and everything is located with
reference to the route selected. More,
the route has only been known for an
hour or twer. so they â er, well, no one
could have planned much of aâ er â at
tack. Suppose we go down on our <iwn
responsibility arrd order the coolies
around from the Chinese quarters and
let them line the course to the Little
West Gate. It will seem as though the
line of march had been changed. At
the last moment they can hasten to
their former places."
I doubt if old Dejneff ever made so
long a Fpeech before, and I doubt If he
ever will make a longer one again. It
was plain he was greatly Influenced,
and equally plain, now, that his plan
was the best that could be -adopted at
this last moment. So I urged him to
give the order; he did so, and I started
to return. But as I went my old
doubts came back In floofltl^e. "With
the route now marked to tfie Little
Gate, why not try the King, after all?
"You mean to go out the Little West
Gate," he mused, nursing a knuckle In
his beard. "It would be roundabout
and a more difficult journey; there
would be some rough bridges to cross,
and the cart the coffin travels in might
come to grief.'" He was talking to him
self â only 'incidentally to me.
and then stood looking away
across the city toward that black spot
on the horizon.
I saw he was moved, so I did not
press him. At last he spoke, and softly,
for him.
WITH now and ttien a grunt of
a Russian oath the old war
rior listened to me to the end,

This is the third in
stallment of "The Queen
of Quelparte," a novel of
the superstitions of the
Koreans and Russia's
secret intrigue in the
Far East-both of which
have led to the present
war with Japan. This
novel is historically
true. It is more fasci
nating than history be
cause of the thrilling
love story that runs
through it. You will
get it complete in
four installments. That
means a SI 50 book for
20 cents â an offer un
equalled anywhere.
Beyond, in the plaza of the bell, was
the vortex of the surging human bil
lows which were sweeping the city. In
that maelstrom, peddlers with trays,
supported by strings about their necks,
were reaping a rich reward, and thieves
a richer. The native soldiers guarding
the Â¦ plaza nad broken ranks (their.offi
cers were In the neighboring drinklrig
houses) and were seated on the ground
nodding before their fires of sticks and
grass, their rifles stacked about them.
Gambling being legalized for the time,
many were playing games of chance.
Thus the hours dragged on.
The first sign of the approaching pa
geant was the arousing of the soldiers
to clear the . avenue. '; - It was soldier's
work, too. Piercing the streets in the
center, the multitude was crowded back
to the houses. â¢ The forward lines were
pushed out by those behind, and the
soldiers pounded the , faces of , those in
the rear with the butts. of their guns."
Slowly a way ..was cleared. -In some
places It was twenty feet in width; here
narrowing, there widening. . Then,*/iri
the center of the opening, was, laid: a
thin line of earth, all the way from the
Russian Legation to. the Imperial | tomb
â for in Quelparte it is beneath the dig-^
nity of the King to walk upon the earth
that has been desecrated by other feet'
Thus wherever the . King goes - fresh
earth is strewn which/ no foot inay
touch until he has passed.
The sight of this faint trail had a ml
raculous effect upon those surging
thousands. They became quiet and ex
pectant each suggestion of the coming
pageant being greeted with delight
Heads of departments .began', flying
back and forth on official -duties; a
Quelpartien general and staff tittupped
along the route, inspecting, at a proper
distance, the line of fresh earth, to see
, My OTders were to flank the imperial
route from the legation to the center of
the city, where the great bell hung.
The crowds had already divined the.
route, and this avenue was the seething
center of the city. It was men's work
for my column to plow through to the
belj, but they went through like men.
My lines once established on either side
the avenue, the crowds were admitted,
temporarily, between them. Here and
there along the route elegant lanterns
were suspended from staves thrust into
the hard ground. The silken ' network
of each was four feet long with a cen
ter of red and a border of blue at the
bottom and top. Within each, thus
thoroughly protected from the wind, a
candle burned on a sharp iron finger.
It may have been 9 o'clock when my
lines were established from the legation
to the great bell. The funeral proces
sion was advertised to start at 9. I was
advised to expect it promptly three
hours later, at midnight
For three hours â though they were
anxious hoursâ I was an Interested
spectator of the Bcene before me.
Through my lines surged the countless
throng. Now it was brushed lightly
aside, as a company of Quelpartien in
fantry trotted down on the' double
quick, formidable in appearance and
sound. No sooner was it again in mo
tion, in aimless "pursuit of happiness."
than a shrill scream rent it asunder, as
a Quelpartien nobleman on a spotless
pony, preceded by busy henchmen,
paced to his place In the Imperial cor
tege. A sackcloth Quelpartien hat cov
ered his netted hair. A rope an inch in
diameter surounded his waist; another,
smaller in size, was caught about his
hat Such was the imperial mourner's
habit f"7iVÂ£.i
al pageant to pass the spot where the
Queen was murdered. C
As I moved away the King looked at
me thoughtfully; then suddenly he
stepped forward. N 
"I. have ordered that your company
surround the -bier on its. Journey; be
watchful and do not spare the lead."
Then he added with something of his
old swagger, and a fresh cloud of ci
garette emoke to frame it in, "There
will be promotions for this â¢ night's
work, Martyn."
I saluted and went back slowly to the
plaza. I had accomplished little or
nothing; yet Dejneff's ruse"Â«as a good
one and* must be trusted now. / -Â¦ v â¢
CHAPTER XIX. r '
THE IMPERIAL FUNERAL. .
The aspect of the heathen city -had "
been wonderful by day. The , g*e at
crowds, the flying pennons and'ban
ners, this nation on a holiday, was a
Bight never to be forgotten, unless one
had seen the night which followedâ this"
nation on a holinightx. *
The crowd became more dense as the
sun went down. To the quarter. of a.,
million inhabitants was now added, a
visiting quarter of a million. Cities and
towns were deserted for a, space fifty,
miles around. The gates of the city had;
been crowded all day. the . grinning^
monkeys on their gables admitting' gcv-/
ernors and beggars, dukes and rrioiinte
banks, priests and criminals, indiscrim
inately, from seashore, mountain and
valley. : . V-X
The sight presented by this half-mil
lion people was indescribable. The ab
sence of lights made the appearance of
the city, doubly significant for there
were no . lights save the candle each
man carried in a little 'paper lantern,
for the moon shone only fitfully.
And so there was "lightâ a burning
glare, but low down as a man's knee.
From where I stood on the plazaof the
legation It seemed that the city was il
luminated by red-hot pavements, a
ruddy glare distinctly marking the di
rection of all the main avenues.
The sound of this moving host was
indescribable. The hard limestone
streets were covered -with tiny pebbles
which rolled and crunched under each
falling foot What was the tumult
arising from a million moving feet? It
was a sound unknown even to the sea.
It was not the continual grind of gi
gantic glaciers. It was like nothing
that ever met my ears. I stood en
tranced a space, looking on those streets
of flame, and listening to the murmur
of that million of sandaled feet
lessly through the^Chiriese quarter, of
the city there was no outbreak.'' Dark-",
ness, an absenceof holiday regalia,- and,
hundreds of sober faces . only -greeted
us there. ' I breathed more easily when
the city gate was reached.?
Just beyond, 'now in sight, r pse the
mausoleum and- the" city of a' night
about it. My heart leaped: at! the sight
of it, reflected. in the glare of the thou
sand lanterns.' Once safely there;? ray

The inspiration of these blessed hopes
gave me strength ,tt> play . my. part to

even, 'spoke, of the pallor of my.coun-"

feast upon, arose on every side, flanked
by great piles'of fruits, Masses of

the cake and fruits. -I wondered where
all this was to be stored^ arid, while per
sonally stationing my. guards, I entered,

was a round room perhaps thirty.; feet
high and as wide. A low marble pedes'

which the sarcophagus was to ..be

Behind the King, at a proper.'distance,"
swarmed a host of coolies* wearing, yel

platform' made "of .bamboo poles: * Upon
Two Quelpartien dukes on great white
horses led it. ; ' Twisted, ropes sur
rounded their waists and hats. Men at
their sides bore silken banners, some in
plain and some in mixed colors, flying
on long poles raised high up in air. Â¦'.
At the first boom of the great belli
went out into the plaza and mounted
my horse. One company in my com
mand which flanked the four sides of
the. plaza was to surround the bier and
guard it At the head of this com
pany I took my place, as the glittering
line of the imperial cortege rounded the
farther wing of the legation and came
slowly by, ..,...'-.
As the night wore on, I became calm
and resolute. The' trying scene in this
room, following immediately .upon the
receipt of Dulcine's Inote, had played
havoc with my weakened nerves. The
cold air and the exercise had strength
ened them. . , " . .
From this pandemonium of heathen
dom, I passed by the guards at the dodr y
and entered .the throne .room." ,â¢" All was
quiet here^ ' In the' dim i "light I saw- the
imperial watch, standing motionless' by
the catafalque! Though I knew they
were Cossacks, I went no nearer, for
there was nothing I could do, however
much 1 longed~to make my presence
known. And so I, too, stood watch
over her!
Before the great bell struck the hour
of midnight 1 1 had taken my station at
the -door of the King's wing. Within
the* King's apartment confusion had
reigned during the last hour before the
pageant started. But without, behind
theÂ« legation, where the pageant was
forming, confusion was worse confused.
The rendezvous of any circus parade 'is
a trivial affair compared with what was
enacted there. For blocks in each di
rection spread the outlandish parapher
nalia â banners, carriages, carts, en
signs^ flags, shields, 1 lanterns, horses,
troopsâ the most illustrious collection of
horribles human eye ever viewed; atten
dants.fightjrig for precedence; coolies
struggling to maintain position against
newcomers; men with bahnerless poles
and men twith poleless- banners, fight
ing for that which each lacked; horses
frenzied with , fear;' mules "richly . capar
isoned, braying for wateri and super
visors of the pageariy at, their wits' end,
charging,, about feckless Â°' ; life >' and
limb. --: ;;'^"^':' ! -"K:>*"
Believe me, : I saw all that I have de
"scribed. Believe : me, also, there was
not a moment' in which I was not
thinking of Dulcine.? It is also quite "as
true that in this crisis my, mind:wan
dered back over the past week'knd fe
called Its strange experiences'; to prove"
to myself I was awake and not'4ream
lng. Again I saw Wuri_Chow and heard
Â¦*lhe cha'ntlnsr in the temple of Ching^
.lirig, and again the tragedy, of the sub
terranean vault.- was enacted! .* Now": I
was^running', madly down Lyrfx -Island
rin' the dark; now shouting, to a tele
grapji instrument in; delirium ; now I
was on from, a fallen horse
through, a valley from which . the : tide
had. .Just gone,, and bargaining for a
loaf of bread from an unknown friend.
Once more. I tried to tell the King on his
tlirone that Li and Ling were lost, and
.that tbe v Queen's body was still on Lynx
Island. "I talked with Dulcine before
(the fire; Kim laid the body in the sar
cophagus; I- watched the King draw on
the great golden cover. If I needed
more proof, my, 'anxious heart could
have given testimony, for I had been
subjected, to surprises â and no sleeper
is surprised in his dreaming. .
Xo,. this was "net a dream.
that it was laid properly to\the,desti
nation. And when at last, 'the .old
ringer entered the bell house and/ the
beam was swung twelve times upon 1 the
great bell, a hush fell <>ver th'e cltyj and
every heart knew the .'appointed hour
was at hand. Instantly a Cossack trum

Instantly, an by magic, the heavy
mnt curtains rhoved aside on the wife
from "which they hung. The girls,
hardly visible t<v those without, were
morÂ» plainly revealed to me. Their
Mack, ?equin*-studded hair fell -loosely

each of them, thrown over one shoulder,
criutrht together on the opposite loin,
and hanging down on one side a hand's
breadth below the knees. Their, black
hair was Ion? and" was wrought Into
tiny snake-like braids which writhed
about as th<* arms were put in iriotlon.
or darted off swiftly with the flames of
the glistening swords which in an In
stnnt wer#Â» whirling in their orbits. .
Such a dance! My regiment could not
have Â¦ protected , me mere securely, f A.
man's life '.was not worth even the dim
mest ray that came from the swords*.
No battlefield ever was'so deadly as the
blazing zone ' through . which â¢ those
swords writhed and hissed. Though. I
had seen the secret of the illumination
employed, nevertheless I utterly forgot
my danger as the. wild dance went on.
It would have made any.man forget
anything.
: . Each broadsword wag a flame '.* of
light; two thrown together with a prac
ticed., hand wrought a sheet of , flame:
the four, when they cut;the semicircle
together," sent blinding blasts . of flre
straight forward/ and. straight back.
: Now a' bolt of chain lightning fell from
the' right or left; seeming to cleave the
ground." / Now - a; flame poised over
head a second,^, then descended as the
glittering, bladeo came down. ] The fine
black braids" of hair' curled lovingly
about the white arms, I or,- flying In the
'wake of the' sweeping swords^ stood ex
tended/ , Often a descending blade sev
ered' them,; "and '.numberless braided
ends ' lay on : the /ground .' beneath .. the
softly stepping sandals. Now a. ball of
fire'rolled spluttering around each form"
as the swords were whirled on a finger:
then each . white f ace â¢ was surrounded
by, a" flame * of , light, the dusky" '. eyes
flashing.- beneath' a . thousand wayward
wisps of. hair. * .
*' I L~could not 'see Into, the' room beyond."
; But all ' had become deathly still.. The
intruders now, knew^ the; nature. of thi3
hidden \ hut^ in the . mountainsâ knew
s they -need not look so . much; as 'to ap
proach' It. ' \* . \
All this I read ln'the' demeanor of the
dancing/. girls. "And" as '~"iny baffled
guards r. turned themselves into slght-
. My question was answered, for Nsase
came to me In the darkness. Finding
me by the swords, she led me back to
my mat. where I lay down again at a
whispered word of command in an un
known ' tongue. Fast quarreling in
tlje outer room had been succeeded
by" violent rummaging about. The
noise came nearer and nearer.
By this time another girl hurt en
tered . the cave. She brought some
Flowing substance like nhosphorus
which the two divided between
them; â¢ then side by side, they took
their station Just within the mat
tin?', a jrlitterina: sword in each hand.
Then I knew I was hidden in a Quel
p.irtien sword-dancer's cave. I was
whor? r.n man had ever been before or
would ever come again. The girls
waited patiently, supremely confident
In their macie power. They expected
irtruders. and intruders came.
I knew that voice. I knew what the
screams meant. I backed mechanically
against the. wall. of tho darkened room,
and "cursed the scoundrels ] for having
taken my sword. For I was ready to
fightâ yes. with the dark cave behind
me I fairly ached to fight them. I
groped along: the wall. It wag. covered
with matting. Then I cut myself on a
sharp'edffe. I felt, arid it was a sword
blade. As I tried to take. It down, ap
other beside it cut me again. And be
yond this were moreâ each sharper
than an adder's fang. What did this
mean?
Then a rough, harsh voice brought
me quickly to my feet, my hand to my
beltless waist. The women screamed.
The soft mat under me, the strange
feeling of safety, the nourishing rice,
made me content for the moment to
stop thinking nnd to try to recover my
strength for the Journey to Keinningâ
for I was confident that I was in the
hands of friends who would see me
through. .
.â¢oom, and an unsavory supper was
aten from wooden bowls.
I . was just going to sleep again.
â Â«uÂ» It turned
out â that -I
was In a cave.
My eyes soon be
came accustomed
to the darkness
(the bandage having
oeen removed) and I
saw a bowl of rice beside
me. From the moment I
saw Nsase I believed that
It '.was 'she who befriended
my servant and me as we
passed this way before, and
*at now she had brought me to
her hidden home to save me from
:ny captors.
Some one lit a candle in the outer
I was greatly .moved Â»by , the gift, re
memWlne that 8 he took V sword away
from me; as wÂ« left the cave.*
After : a while Nsase reached under
her long robe (she had taken mine off)
and drew out a long, beautiful scab
bard containing - a % finer sword than
many more ' exalted officers \ than I
carry.- With an atteriipt at laughing
the 'girl' surrendered it to me, and then
girt 1 the belt around my waist. Â¦ For a
second she held the scabard. She . was
very close to me, and looked away at
the distant city. , Then she dropped It
arid went to her horse.
Before we went out and mounted
their horses, Nsase wrapped me in a
long white robe, such as that she wore.
She took the lead, and we pushed the
horses on silently from ten o'clock until
dawn. As it began to grow light we
were getting down deep into the mists
of the Phan Valley, and I knew that
when they lifted Keinning would be in
sight. , When it became light enough
for us. to see each other, Nsase dropped
back, and we rode side by side. Now
and again I knew the girl was looking
at me from between the folds of her
white head dress. We had not spoken
âfor good reasons. And yet amid all
else I'was thinking, I had not forgotten
her; she was not a girl easily forgotten.
In a hundred ways she had shown that
she had seen the world and knew it.
Where had she come from, that' she
should now be found in the mountains
of Quelparte, a past-master in the'out
la wed profession . of sword-dancing?
And now, her, wild lessons learned from
the old woman with whom she lived
(for Quelpartlens are known as unri
valed in this soldier's art), what
strange land would claim her, what
cities praise " herâ Singapore or : Ran
goon, Lasisa or Port Said? Strong,
handsomeâ oh, well; something: set me
to humming "Mandalay." /
At last the mist did lift. And there
was Keinning Just at our feet. Nsase
had come -farther with me than neces
sary, but I think she would have gone
farther, much farther.*
'She drew uoher tired horse on the
last range of foothills, and dismounted.
She pointed' to the distant city, then,
with a sad smile on her face.*. up the
road which she must return. I ' dis
mounted, too, to rest a* moment." It
seemed good to feel safe again. We
stood still awhile by our horses. I was
more grateful to her than I could ever
tell, could we have spoken .the same
language. It was a relief not to be able
to. try. '
I had grown despondent. I did not
know what the strange carousal of the
dancing girls meant, and I feared what
might. happen when all became drunk.
I took down a forbidden sword and lajr,
quiet on my bed.
I must have dropped asleep, and I
knew not when the scene changed in
the other room, nor Just when Nsase
and her sister ceased playing the trag
edy they acted so well. I awoke when
Nsase aroused me by unclasping my
fingers from the sword. She was
dressed decently and heavily, as "for
traveling. She smiled as I sat up, and
instantly helped me to my feet. I saw
she intended to start me on my way.
In an instant I was ready, but I
paused and pointed to' the sword. I
wanted that. But Nsase took my out
stretched hand and led me into the
other room.
Her sister and the old woman were
gone. By the light of a paper lantern
we picked our way along by the over
turned pots and Jugs. Nsase paused
as- we neared the door, looked at me,
nnd then glanced behind her. She still
held my hand and now she pressed it.
I looked over her shoulder.
The two Chinamen lay stretched on
the floor. The color of the liquor was
on their bloated facesâ and another
color too! In searching for me they had
found the sword-dancers' hut, which no
man may know, much less enter. And
yet into it they had broken, rough and
furious.- They would trouble them and
me no more!
Food was prepared for the visitors,
and the Jars of sul, or native beer,
clinked as they were raised and low
ered. There was more laughter than
talk, and more* sul than rice. The girls,
still fantastically dressed In the scant
raiment in which they had danced.' led
in the laughter and did most of the
talking; and Nsase outtalked and out
laughed her sister. The soldiers an
swered with many a coarse guffaw,
which grew louder for a while â and
then quite ceased.
seers rather than spies. ; the quick
witted dancers turned their cunning in
to an exhibition rather than a continua
tion of it as a menacing defense. They
came back, sweeping the cave with
light; they came forward in perfect uni
son and swiftly, throwing the great
Â¦words about' them to a weird song
â¢which now became a feature of the
performance. The new development of
the fiery dramaâ the melody of the
monotone and the more elaborate
scenic display, the circles and squares
of flame, and other nameless convolu
tionsârendered the close of the exhibi
tion as marvelous as the beginning.
Next to the last service at the Tempi*
of Ching-IIngi I shall ever remember
the dance of Nsase. the sword-dancer,
which saved my life on the mountain*
of Quelparte that night.
At the end came a tumult- of ap
plause' from the delighted spectators,
now utterly at the mercy of my friends.
I eaw at once they meant to stay all
night; and I also saw, with disquietude,
that they v were being received with hos
pitality, to say the least. Perhaps any
thing else would have aroused suspi
cion.
I was awakened by some one softly
bathing my face with a. cloth.-,. For. a
moment I lay still, half fearing: to open
my eyes. When I did so, I looked Into
the face of a young . girl who was wip
ing the blood ' from my L cheeks; she
held .out the, crimson cloth before . my
face to explain- her .action, and smiled
as she did so. I saw she was no Quel
partienne; short skirt of ' red," and
cap of green, and an open, thin, nut
. brown, face made this pla In. And I
felt Instantly that she kner^ I, toot*
was;.a foreigner. When I raised my
hand I found it was neatly ban
daged, though I still lay in the
path where I had fallen. ""
I sat up 'quickly and point
ed to the summit of the
mountain.
"C hiname n," â¢ I
stammered,', trying to
express my fears by.
voice and expres-/
sion; then, I re
peated It in
French.
"Chenois?"

The girl un
derstood. She
smiled and

CHAPTER XXIII.
CHAPTER XXL
THE MASQUERADERS.
When I regained consciousness, the
cun was in the zenith. The horse to
which I was tied was climbing upward
slowly, and behind me rode two men.-
We were still ascending rocky ridges
toward the mountain crest, which I
-nov.- saw was not far distant. The men
behind me talked excitedly; now and
then they laughed. \ My capture evi
dently meant much to them, yet they
mcy not have been thinking of me at
alL # At any rate, all I knew was that
they* talked Chinese â and perhaps I
could not have known anything worse.
Of course I knew nothing of their des
tination, though I recognized at once
the stony byroad on which I had come
up from Han Chow to Keinning.
I think no one ever cared less about
the future than I did then. I remember
I wished to "go to my Gawd like a sol
dier," as the English soldiers singâ not
to be tcrtured to satiate the hate of a
Chinese mandarin.
I wns bound with ropes made of
twisted straw; now and then by raising
myself on my hands, or by straighten
ing the muscles of my limbs, I was able
to lessen the pain, but when eased thus
I thought of Dulcine smothering in that
marble tomb. Then I relaxed my mus
cles and let my bonds cut and tear me.
Yet, as time passed the same thoughts
came in spite of the pain. I remem
bered the distracted Oranoff, and
prayed God he would believe we had
run away together; and I swore, to far
as 1 was' concerned, that he should
never know otherwise.
But what of Dulcine? Could she live?
Had the concussion of the falling of
that" tremendous tablet killed her? If
not, was she not alive? I remembered
the great e1zÂ« of the tomb and knew
ebe could not exhaust the air-In it In
an hour or a day â no, not in a week. As
for food, she was buried in itâ food to
last a soul's lifetime; yet the fragrance
of that cake and spice, would not that
suffocate her? And I really wondered
If it would not be a blessing to her to
hope that It would, and speedily!
With these thoughts imc hope â a
hope quite as agonizing e.s the despair
in which it was conceived. There "was
chance enough of the girl's living, I be
lieved, to warrant any attempt to es
cape even though I had to thread the
â¢finest needle in the world to do It; if
alive, Dulcine could not live very long,
and if I would bring assistance I must
work quickly. The measure of my life
measured hers, and the least I could do
now was to risk my life generously in
the attempt to save hers.
We hid that day In a deep valley,
v.here my guides treated me with bet
ter favor than I had hoped, and at dark
we started on again. It was midnight
before we came up to a hut on the
mountain near to the rocky road, where
rr.y legs were unbound, and, supported,
as I had need to be, by a servant, I
was taken into a lighted room and
dropped upon a stool at the end of a
long table.
The light blinded me. but I knew a
man sat opposite. Slowly nis features
became distinct. I started, for I
thought at first it was Oranoff. Then It
was all plainâ I was facing the mas
querade r who had lured me from Dul
cine's side.
He had replaced the false imperialâ
to give me a better welcome, and obvi
ate an introductionâ and he grinned a
hellith grin as I stared aghast. Now I
saw that his face was too wide for Ora
noff's and lacked, on closer view, the
colonel's color; the black hair and eye
brt-v.s, however, helped the deception.
"Mr. Robert Martyn, I believe." "The
wild grimace returned the moment the
words were Epoken.
"At your service." I answered sharp
ly: I would not h\x+ the devil outdo
â¢me. and then I blurted out quickly and
angrily enough: "Bv G^d. you shall pay
dear for this outrage, sir."
) "Jamie," he replied, drawling the
Quelpartien oath like a native, and
drew the false beard from his face.
Then he roiled a cigareUe and lighted
it. looking at me out of the corner of
his eye. Sore as I was, and exhausted,
I looked this man over as I had never
looked at another. That he was surely
the tool of Prince Tuen I knew; beyond
that I could not get; his nationality
CHAPTER XXII
A RUDE AWAKENING.
As. we went back to that hut.in the
mountains my words, "You are a liar,"
came back to me. .and I repeated them
again and again, and no words ever
fitted my lipo so snugly..' Fi.-r I felt in
every nerve that' I was right. Sahib
Menin, for so his servant called him,
was throwing boldly, -now, on the
strength of the effect of his knowledge
of what I had done, but I believed more
and more each moment that -his was a
stupendous deception. He had not re
leased Dulcine! She would have obeyed
none but that preconcerted signalâ and
that signal he could not have known!
In all else I might be wrong,', but lat
such a time as this Dulcine would keep
faithfully "her word. "Remember ,the
signal of the scabbard," she. had writ
ten; how then could she forget? Least
wise if she had been false to c-ur agree
ment she must now pay the penaltyâ
for I purposed to act as I. would, had I
known she was in the marble^ tomb,
where, unless she had broken faith with
me, she surely was. ... . . . . â¢ ;.. .
So I, simply determined to get to
Keinning the quickest' arid-best way I
could, then slip my guards, Â£ and . go
about the task of releasing Dulcirie.
It Â¦waj*. graving into day
as we put , back over the
briery path. I forecast
we could j not reach
Kelnning before mid
night, and; I resolved
to play every hand
slowly in order to
make it later
so exhausted that the jogging of the
pony. put me to sleep, , and I awakened
only when"he"stumbledron'th'e stones.
But Iseemed tb\thinkjand plan even
as I slept. My chief I anxiety; was; flrit
to 'escape my; guards, : , and ' I soon : began
to believe this would -be [ no easy . trick.
TheyTwere /powerful J Chinamen, and
their faces said ithey^were fit (tools for
such as Menin and Tuen. They would
hold no â¢ manner, of 'conversation with
me; .indeed; they Ualked *by signs to
each other," though .1 could see . in a mo
ment both understood -what I 'said, to
them. â¢."Â¦Â¦-.â¢_Â¦â¢â¢ :' :;.'- : :;.Â¦'.Â¦: ; 'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
.Yet we were late In our start, and for
that â¢ I' was,' ahead.'" Inlj coming frorA
Keinnlngy we had traveled one ; whole
night and half a second^-at least fifteen
hours.- 1 At our .best 'we, could not reach
Keinning before i. midnight, and .1 set
about the task of ? seeing that we did
not do our ' best .. When I: awoke from
each successive nap ; I asked \ painfully
f or./water, : and rhy . guards ' stopped al
ways at the nearest spring. I groaned
not a - little, .and once . begged to rest on
the ground. I found > it an easy role to
play exhausted, for .1 1 was nearer, to it
than 'â¢probably I realized .myself. At
this spring' they let me. sleep an hour at
least,' for which I wag * proportionately
thankful. " â¢ ... '
â¢ I am sure they did not, penetrate my
Yuse; and I ki\ew: if we did not .reach
Ke'innlng before; three 'o'clock in. the
morning, thers was . no hope of seeing
the 'King before the evening following.
In V. those . twelve . hours I felt sure I
could get-free. ..
Menin had so skillfully mingled
what' I believed to be lies with What I
feared was the truth; that I was in a
maze \ of perplexities: for instance, he
had said incidentally ; that Oranoff had
gone to Chef u-Y Now this was a. mat
ter about which he', would not have lied
to me lest an unimportant fib should
menace the fabric built up on his great
er falsehood. Oranoff must â¢ have "at
tended the imperial funeral and: then
gone straightway tbTsi and Chefu;
how Menin could know this, - when he
had preceded me to that hut In the
mountains, was a bafiling. mysteryâ yet
was it not welcome news? If out of the
country, Oranoff would- not know of
Dulclne's disappearance- or mine; per
haps-he need never know,* if Dulcine
could be saved within a few days. So I
worried and planned and_ argued, all
day long, fighting my fears aw^y like
a swarm of stinging gnats; but ever
holding with dogged tenacity to the be
lief that Dulcine . Oranoff was in that
marble tomb, since: no : one else had
known our ; signal of the â¢ scabbard.
g I was dozing as the afternoon faded
Into twilight, when suddenly. the ground
seemed to -give way, and I \ was drop
ping through air. â¢ "When I ; first be
came conscious . I was lying on my.
liorse, ar.d . we were both shootnig .
swiftly, down a smooth precipice of
sandstone,- the rope by â¢ which I
was tied to my horse being severed
as we shot along. My.guides .had
-stopped ; fo^^aome reason, and -my
pony had evidentl v 'gone | to the de
ceptive â¢ edge of the I precipice to Â¦
browse.' We brought up with "a crash
in tall bushes, which had taken root
in' a wide, natural catchwater, through
'which ".I was "thrown {by, the force of the
impact, and lay sprawling on the rock,
quite breathless, as^my : guards, wild
with 'excitement, rushed Ho the point
where my horse had fallen.
They w<Â«fe:not more ''surprised than
I; "but thWpwcre"- a ergat deal more
unlucky. 5*oV a moment I lay still
to set my breath. Then I rose aa
best I could, and ran along,
keeping behind the shrubs.
A. rifle shipped on the
edge above me.. Its
companion _ repeated
the' command, and.
blood trickled from
my hand, for the
ball went between
"Jamie, boy, how came yoy into all
this? What have you been doing? I will
tell you, so you miiy know with whom
you are dealing. You sailed from Lynx
Island in the night to Han Chow. The
coward KepnefT failed you. and the
wire* You went on to Keinning. You
told OranofT the Queen's body was in
the new sarcophagus. At midnight you
met Dulcine OranofT and induced her to
make good your failure. Lieutenant
Kim and you placed her in the sarcoph
agus at daylight that morning;."
Aghast as I was at this man's knowl
edge, I played my part as best I could
and smiled, when he paused, indiffer
ently.
"And what have you gained," I
sneered presently, "for all your spy
ing?" â¢ â¢ ;
He started up quickly, for this was a
tender spotâ his failure â and he cried:
"I have gained all -you have lost." ' -
I knew he meant Dulcine, and I t/em
bled. Did he mean anything more?
"My God!" thought I â and here I
sprang to my feet with a gaspâ "did he
release Dulcine himself and take her
captive too?"
Promptly the villain laid a revolver
on the table before him and I
sat down, my head in my
hands. It was bad enough to
believe Dulcine' to be in that
marble tomb, but held a cap
tive in a den of this man's
choosing â oh! this broke my
spirit utterly, and I groaned
aloud.
"Come, come, lad, groans
will not save fair lady," he
said presently with mocking
hilarity; "but follow me. and
I will tell yo.^uhat will."
We went out. "Sahib/' his
servant, and myself, and
mounted three Korean po

and for half an hour we fol

blood for that."
The man begun laughing again, and
It was plain now that my fear for the
girl I had buried alr^e was the cause of
his hilarity. I certainly had got my
self in a devilish plight, the more so as
my captors had much to avenge them
selves for. But then, suddenly, the
black eyes narrowed on me, and thft
light of laughter died down, smothered
by hate.
"Par Dleu," he growled suddenly,
"but I thoygbt that your long suit" â
and I knew he meant the travesty of
the funeral Just completed. I had, at
last, touched the man to the quick. I
probed deeper now. mad with fear for
Dulcine.
"A bad habit of trying to do what I
am bid," I answered hotly, though I
was attempting "now to moet him on
his own ground of supercilious indiffer
ence: "I do not play Impostor, tht.^sh,"
I added casually; "I know something
besides deceit."
his manner served only to arouse my
anger, and agaVn it . got the better of
me.
"And what am I, sir," I snarled, "the
captive of a oandit or a prisoner of
war?"
"That will be for you to determine,
mydear Martyn," he said with a yawn;
and he called a boy, who brought a
bottle of cognac and a wine glass. At
a word my wrists were freed, and. a
glass was filled and placed before me.
The liquor gave me strength to be sen
sible and keep still. It made the exas
perating smile on his face return; at
last he threw back his head and
laughed outright and heartily. I glared
across the table, insane to seize that
white throat, but I kept still. Finally
when he realized I would amuse him no
longer, he sobered ana drank again- -
"No, captain, I â¢< m no bandit, nor are
you a prisoner of war. In fact, this is
quite irregular. I ut you will allow me
the liberty to say that you have a pro
pensity for Betting In the way;" and he
smiled and put his cigarette to his lips,

"All is well, then," replied my captor.
And at a sign from him ( the -servant
discharged a revolver three times in
succession. In a moment two lights
'glimmered from the little vessel. Then
Menin dismounted and handed the bri
dle of his pony to the servant, where
upon he turned to^ne.

from shore. "Dulcine Oranoff is 'there,

"Oh; the people. thought we had him
here; and; had put the screws on him
to pull , through this 'protectorate, - nnd
the Cabinet made him clear out 'for the
new palace." ,
"He has "gone already ?"
"He "went' to-night ; } we couldn't keep
him, arid ,we didn't want hlin either.".;
So , here was the 'end "of s rriy plan to
see â¢ the King ; to-night; In fact, r I
doubted "whether -If could ever; see him
alone v now, hedged in as tie"? probably
Lights were moving up and down in
the legation, but the King's wing was
dark as the night, and I wondered how
it was that Whang-Su was not meeting
his Cabinet as of yore.
' The" whole place seemed unnatural. I
shook myself Rnd repeated. the question 1
to Dejneff, and now he found his voice:
â¢ "Oranoff, or his ghost." The man's
breath left him with those four words/
But soon he. found it and continued:
"We were coming in from the imperial
mausoleum after dusk, a few Cossacks
and myself, and near the great bell we
ran into a street fight. ; The crowd
scattered as we dashed up, and there
on the'ground lay Colonel Oranoff. We
brought him \ to the legation. For a
time he was unconscious, and when at
last he came around he did not know
where he was/ arid attempted to get
out of his bed and go away; the Cos
sacks pulled him back, and he lies
there now like a_tlger. I am afraid he
has been hurt, on the head, and it has
struck in."
Dejneff spoke like a child, and it was
plain that he was all knocked up.
-.' I j was pushing on toward the lega
tion door as we talked, dragging Dej
neff with me. I feared that I could not
see Oranoff. We had reached the great
door now,' and. I felt sure that Dejneff
had not 'told me all the truth.
- "Come, old man,"/ 1 said, taking him
sternly by the lapel of his great coat;
"what's up? How did Oranoff come to
Keinrilng, and how was he hurt?" I
could not go on until I knew more.
' '"Damn me if I know, Martyn; go see
for yourself." . â¢; â¢
.I r dragged him into my room. I did
not know .whether I wanted to go to
Oranoff yet or not. While Pak was
getting the brandy and soda, we sat
looking ? at each otber in silence,
though pejneff swung himself around
and around in his chair every half
minute with; a deep sigh.
'As 'we waited, the Interior of that
room brought back a score of painful
memories. Here I had ' conceived and
carried Wo execution this reckless tra
vesty which, for all I knew now, was
to cost sever*t- of us our lives. I re
membered what Oranoff had once said
about peace costing the Czar the lives
of his best; if Oranoff had been parma
nÂ»ntly Injured, a good life t had surely
been: wrecked in Quelparte to avert a
"war. with Japan! Even; the pictures on
which I had . hung some of those silk
garments â¢ were still askew, . and . the
chair .stood before the fireplace just
where it had stood when I told Dulcine
, story â¢ of Lynx Island. As I
thought of 'Dulcine I shudderedâ for
fear Dejneff would speak of her! What
could they think of her . absence with
. Colonel': Oranoff In such "a condition?
But; might it not be that even this was
fortunate? I tried to think it was.
The liquor did . something ; toward
making ' men of . us againâ being good
for* all poisons." Dejneff was quite, him
; self, f; and â¢ niy * presence seemed to - give
his cohfldence.V 1 ' : N \
-."This protectorate business has been
going all agilrist the grain," he said at
last/ with a' nod toward . the King's
wins' of the legation. I remembered
that it was dark. :'Â¦ "It's set the people
against us, which explains this attack
on Oranoff."' Â¦
/-I wai thinking it was Tuen's revenge.
"Has the; King heard it?" I asked.
"No," the King has left."
I started.
"What do you mean, Dejneff ?"
When I came up he stopped quickly
in his tracks. While he was growling
out some Rusian oaths with his usual
zest, I could see thai he was not the
same gruff old Dejneff. There were so
many things I wanted to ask him that
I was at a loss which to ask first, and
yet I did not forget that there was one
question which I must .not permit him
to ask me; I did not want him to men
tion Dulcine. .
"Oranoff is here?" I seized his coat
sleeve as I spoke. the wordsJ He took
the cigar out of his mouth and nodded
dumbly. The grizzled warrior, always
ready before with an oath or, gruff
laugh, only nodded, . now, to this the
most serious Question I ever asked a

more to make me sure that something
was wrong. "
A NEW DEJNEFF.
CHAPTER XXVI.
And so I turned toward the Japanese
settlement, as I went into Keinning,
and lodged at a Japanese inn. From
there I boldly indited a letter to Colo
nel Oranoff, saying that for reasons
which he would fully approve when he
knew them Dulcine and I had left
Kelnning . together. * I dated my note
from Tsi, the morning after the fu-
The mound was about fifty feet in
height. The diameter of its base was
equal to its height. The gravel sides
had been turfed with grass since the
Imperial funeral. The magic city which
had been at its base had disappeared
with the army and the great concourse
of people. All the temporary buildings
had been taken away; but the Hall of
Spices remained, for it was not tempo
rary. It was to be the temple of the
tomb, where services to the memory of
the Queen would be celebrated. As I
pushed ray horse down' from the hills,
I felt the fever of fear fill my veins.
Was it, verily, a tomb?
As I came nearerâ for I had to pass
the mound to reach the east gate â I
saw workmen on Its summit erecting a
diminutive temple roof to shelter the
face of the great tablet. My spirits
rose at the sight of these men, and I
strained my eyes to catch a glimpse of
a familiar form; for, during the ride
from the sword-dancer's cave, I had de
cided that my hope lay In one manâ old
Ling's son. Kim. Not until then had I
thought of him, and remembered his
appointment as secret guardian of the
Queen in his father's place. I congrat
ulated myself on having kept my hasty
promise to the father, for as I thought
of ft I was surer than ever that Dul
cine Oranoff '8 life was in his hands;
but I dared not think what the grave
youth would do or say. I knew the
penalty of an attempt to mock the ter
rible legend and enter that mausoleum;
the body of the ghoulish vandal would
be divided among the capitals of the
twenty provinces, to be displayed in a
public place.
If Kim could not help me, there was
but one man left to ask. That was the
King, and asking him would be to tell
the whole miserable story of Lynx
Island and Prince Tuen's victory. And
yet, had not a week passed without
the fulfillment of the terrible myth?
Was the King not sane still, and the
dynasty still secure? And might not an
other week go by like this â and many?
I pushed my horse on as fast as it
could go, knowing each moment was an
eternity to Dulclne. I passed within a
hundred yards of the mausoleum and
watched the score of men who were at
work upon the little temple roof. The
material for it was being brought up on
the very car and track upon which the
golden sarcophagus had ascended.
As I looked again upon these scenes
so indelibly impressed on niy memory,
I thought of the terrible experiences
Dulclne had endured since she bade me
that last farewell. How the poor girl
must have waited and waited and
waited in her narrow cell for the sig
nal that never came! How her ex
hausted nerves must have trembled!
How her very life-blood must have
been wrung from her heart as the mo
ments passed! Did she know when the
service of the priests was over? Could
she have known when she was placed
upon the Eliding car? Did the realize
that she was beyond the Altar of
Spices â aj'e, beyond all human power
to save? Did she feel herself being
lowered into the tomb â or h'ad he.stun
ning, deafening shock of the falling
tablet first told her that her lover had
proven faithless and had sent her to a
living tomb after falling to bring back
the real body of the Queen?
I ached to hurry now to the mound,
but I could not, dressed as I was. And
so I pushed on Into the city. But here
another question arose. Where should
I go? I could not go to the legation. Al
ready Colonel Oranoff might have given
out the news of Duldne's absence, and
of mine. Yet I was sure he would be
lieve we were together, and that he
would not quickly make public our dis
appearance. I could not help wonder
ing if in all his diplomatic days he had
ever faced a riddle more difficult to
solve than this.
But if ever I had a hard problem it
was a kitten's plaything to this: How
could that mound, made impregnable
by the best of human skill, be entered,
and the prisoner released?
But as I ncared It, rejoicing in my
freedom, the terrible fear that Dulcine
was not there â that she was something
worse, even, than burled alive, re
turned. No matter how frequently I
crushed down this awful fear, it would
return, and I would again hear the
devil Menin's sneering words of tri
umphâ
"I have gained all you have lost!"
But I was determined to stand fast to
my course. The fears, the sneering
threats â nothing: should alter my trust
in Dulcine. She had known the signal,
and I had certainly never given It, and
that another could have accidentally
given it was a possibility too remote to
be considered now.
THE KEEPER OF THE TOMB.
As I descended into the great plain in
which Kelnning lay, my eyes tested
steadily on this conical mound ol earth.
No one gazing from those heights could
have overlooked that peculiar forma
tion.
CHAPTER XXIV.
..During a part of; the time garrulous
Kysang talked, I slept. There was
I nothing^ I j could do before the time I
had set to go to the King but sleep, and
there was nothing I needed to do more.
The booming of the great bell at mid
night of my first night with . Kysang
awoke me with a fright I had never
felt' in my life before.
\ "O mother! O mother mine," the iron
monster 'cried, and a thousand mothers
of Quelparte unconsciously turned in
their sleep, and dreV closer the infants
beside them. And old Kysang 1 , believ
ing implicity that the cry was that of
r the murdered babe, lovingly* stroked
the quivering metal' with his bony hand
and crooned a plaintive lullaby.'
On the second night I awoke with a
frightened sob, as the great beam
swepfagain through the air and an
nounced midnight. .
- Yet I Â¦ arose determinedly, shook old
Kysang's hand roughly, and started for
the door.
There my legation boy Pak almost
ran into me.
."Colonelâ Oranoffâ hasâ come â hurt
âveryâ badlyâ " he panted.
â¢ - ' * â¢
And the Queen fainted where she
stood. " Â¦'â¢ Â¦Â¦
With an aching heart I watched the
still figure till It was lost amid the
great boulders by the side of the moun
tain path. Then I turned to my horse
in baste to pass Ksase's good favor on.
My life was saved, and thereâ yea, the
mists had Just lifted from itâ Â«tood the
mound of the imperial mausoleum.
\.
Though now. more deeply in her debt,
I was utterly helpless to repay Xsase,,
however much I longed to show my
gratitude. But I could not in any way,
and I only pressed her hand as I grave
her the bridle, and bade her "au reyoir"
âfor, if God was good to me, I would
yet repay her kindness. She sat quiet
a little while on her pony, then, as I
moved aside, she rode off slowly and
never once looked back.
jlj Then the King set another day for
the casting, and ordered that the witch
ard lier child' be found. < The man was
raised: from the ground," to -which he
had fallen in anguish and terror,\ a n<l,Â»
with a troop of horsemen, rode rapidly â¢
off Into the mountains. The praxers of
a nation followed thewi and brought
them safely back.
And now the green hillside witnessed
again the assembling of the nationâ for
every.wherethe strange tale had ?one.
Even the lame and the blind came, and ;
the great white-robed concourse formed
another' semicircle about the. molten;,
crater! On the dais, again spread with,
tiger-skins, saV the Kirig and , the
Queen.: The courrin gorgeous.apparel
again waited.
Just as the Queen arose to give tho;
signal for the; filling of the mold, a
strange form was" seen running through
the crowds of people. , All eyes turned
It was the witch. -:.-'\*
On she ran. Reaching the red-hot
crater, she unloosened a babe ! from her
back and looked upward to the daW.V
With a wave of her white fingere the
Queen gave the terrible command, and
the babe was cast headlong into the
boiling maelstrom of heated iron; ;
As it went downward its plaintive cry
rang out, and all the people heard :
"Eirimlle, - Emmlle-^ mother! O
mother mine!" psi^jg^SPPSf
<It Is said 'that ; cry: â¢was, heard ; in
every part of the : kingdoriv. and jnbt a "
mother' but shuddered -knd turned
. quickly to her sleeping babe.
Then the great, mold was filled, but
the people" waited in silence for the
Â¦cooling*- of the bell, and Â¦ feasted not.?
The chains straightened and Â¦ lifted it
again in air. -_ ,'
. A nation ' held its breath. The mo
riierits passed. But the bell remained
whole. The life-blood of. the babe Jiad,
proven ,'the . rare flux needed to .cement
its /ponderous sinews. Cheer: upon
cheer arose, ; and the King proclaimed
, a holiday. A wooden V beam was ; gar-;

the V King's : command ; it was swung .
back and descended. .
: But', what'; sound "came forth? Only
the 1 : cry of the -burning babe:
: "Emrriile! Emralle!"
On this circle the work of excavating
for. the foundation of . the city wall Im
mediately began. \' One > day a workman
struck his pick ' in a metal , substance.
Digging carefully around j it, he; soon
brought to light a small iron . bell of
perfect proportions. The discovery was'
noised abroad, and the King ; ordered
the bell brought to the palace. Imme
diately a proclamation went forth that
a gigantic bell should be cast to -hang
in the center of the capital, each of the
twenty provinces being asked to fur- ;
nish one-twentieth of the metal, that it
might truly be a'nationalbell. ""
Messengers/ were sent riding forth to
each province to bring the metal to the
great mold . which was being prepared
at Keinning. Each province y contribu
ted its share gladly, and soon the King
appointed a day for the casting. The
nation assembled with' the King and
court on the hillside above the '. molten
mass of metal. At the raising of the
Queen's hand the mold was filled..".'Af
ter a feast the great bell was lifted on
mighty chains to hang before all the
people.' But, even as the cheers of the
thousands .went up, a loud report was
heard which silenced the tumultuous
applause.
The side of the bell had cracked!
Confusion reigned in the court,' and
the King's face was white with' min
gled' anger and fear as he' proclaimed
that the bell would be recast on the
morrow, and sent the people running
to their temples to pray. .
On. the morrow a greater concourse
gathered; a- greater feast' was prepared.
Again the metal was heated, : hotter
than before. AÂ§rain, at the Queen's
signal, the great 'mold was filled, the
feast was enjoyed,, and the bell was
lifted from the mold! Â¦ ' â .
AndiWith a -mightier report again it
burst asunder. The King and; his no
bles .frflj.o n their faces. -The people
rushed jft way now of their own accord,

-. Yet:one.of all those thousands stood
still. With an agonized face upturned
this man beat his breast and walked
onward," alone, up toward his prostrate
King. Neaiing the great dais built
on the. greensward,- he fell on 'the
ground. A nobleman turned the King's
eye to him, and at a signal he arose.
"Sire, I. was a gatherer of metal in
Rang-do. As I went through a little
village I asked for metal at each hut.
In one., darker than the rest, I -uttered
my request. Whereupon an old Wv>:nan
replied, from the gloom:* 'I have v no
metal, but take this,' and she unbound
a babe- from her back and held it out
to me. I laughed and went- on. But as
I went, the woman cursed the bell."
The court arose at these words, and
all exclaimed: ; , . '
"A' witch has cursed the bell!" .Â¦ â

rounding mountains. . The composition,

being struck by a wooden 'instead of â¢
an iron tongrue, give to its tone a'".pe
culiar- quality,, which i is likely,' to ' pre- f
serve forever, the" terrible legend which
has conje down the centuries with it.
The sound is plaintive and â pathetic, ,
from whatever, part of 'the, city you
hear itâ as if it were, in reality, the
death-cry of a child.
; r The" dynasty to which Wharig^Su be
longed began one hundred years before
Columbus^, discovered America^ so oid
Kysang affirmed in telling the story of Â¦
the great'bell." -I thought I "could have
told pretty nearly Â¦when'it should have
ended/if myths be true, but^ I ? held my
peace , and.- smoked 'on. Each new dy- '
nasty must have a new capital; so the
new King sent out three wise men , to
locate the ; site of his capital." ",These
wipe men," like all. wlse'/men, fell into a
dispute,, but jon, awakening one morn
ing, they -found a narrow line of. snow
which formed afclrcle just here In the
plain. of ; Phan River: Providence had
settled the^ question," and had indicated
the propitious spot by\ this band" of
snow..
With half an oath and; half a sob -I
âspent" hound, that I. was-^-determined
to cling to the track of the lost lad Kim;
arid I plodded on, trembling and ex r
hausted, to the bell house to wait. Â¦. ,
' By', only v one thins* was I .cheered--.
Colonel Oranbff's absence. The Reeling
in that great city against us was grow
ing Intense. It would have been all his'
life was "worth to walk. these streets
now. Yet I believe I wished a -little
that I could confess, every thing to him.
This suspense was slow poison. '
Then Oranoff had not received my. de
ceptive note. He .was out of the coun
try; and there wereflve days in which
to get Dulcine from the tomb,, and to
meet her father at Tsi. I hardly
paused to thank the man for obtaining
for me such an enviable commission in
that most wonderful body of horse in
the world. I know he was thinking :as
much of Dulcine as of me in doing so.\
I told my boy where -I wished to go
as nearly as I could, and he became my
guide. At lest he paused before a door
and spoke to a little girl playing near.
It was Kim's house. , The girl called
her mother, who told my boy that Kim
had gone away the night of the funeral
and would return home at stated times.
He had not come yet, and they did not
know when he would .come. They t were
happy in his fortunate apointment; but
the news of the father's death,; though
they had not seen him for two long
years, brought a gloom which even the
son's promotion could n6t dispel.
Here was the end of. my last, rope.. . I
could learn nothing further of th? dis
appearance of Kim Ling.
I asked that news of his return be
sent to his uncle, the old ringer of the
bell, and I" turned gloomily away, p '
I would wait a little for Kim before I
went to the Sling. Passing by an Inn,
I stopped long enough to\write a note
to the Russian Minister, saying that I
had gone on a little journey : to the
mountains, and would return to Kein
ning in time to take the boat on which
Colonel Oranoff and his daughter would
return from China. I also explained
that Dulclne had joined her father at
Tsi and had gone to Chefu with him. .
" Had a scorpion crawled out of the
words, I could not have started more
suddenly. The white- lie I was telling
was the very black lie the devil Menin
told me! And Oranoff had gone to Che
fu, as the trickster said! I: had. not
thought of that before. Now. I
thought and trembled. )'"'-'Â¦'
I am sure I should not have been
blamed for doubting Dulcine here; but
I did not.' Menin may have been right
regarding Oranoff, and wrongf concern-
Ing his daughter. No good liar fails to
season his falsehoods with a pinch of
truth. . . , '

locked, and the keeper was away. I
was turning to leave for Kim's \ house,
when my j boy came hurrying up. . He
brought this letter: , . "Â¦Â¦',
The tablet had fallen fairly into its
place upon the sunken tomb, without
sign of crack or other mar. Directly
upon It were laid the light sleepers of
the little building now being erected.
It was a handsome little structure of
cedar wood in which the memorial tab
lets would be kept for Inspection. The
building was not intended as a temple,
for the temde of the tomb had been
built to be permanent, and there the
sacrifices and incense would be burned.
Thus I gazed around me while I tried
to think of my next step. It was
plain that this man, even if he knew,
would not tell me where Kim Ling was;
I doubted if he knew. But I made one
more effort to set something out of
him:
"Yes, I have been to. the barracks,"
I replied with great lack of regard for
the truth, "but he left the barracks on
the night of the funeral. His commis
sion took effect when the Queen was
buried; where else.' then, would he be
save here â on Lynx. Island?"
But even my sarcasm was of no avail
wfth this sturdy man. Yet the two
talked a moment behind my back. Then
one said gently:
"Kim Ling's Uncle Kysang is ringer
of the bell; he can tell you where Kim
lives, arid no doubt you can get scent
of him there."
I was indebted to the men for this in
formation, but I lingered for â well, for
strength to take up the search. I
leaned heavily upon the sweet new tim
ber Just brought from ths far-off moun
tains; I prayed to God then as I never
had- before, and as I prayed for the
strength to find Dulclne and save her,
there came, In the scent of the cedars,
the memory of my boyhood home in
dear old Vermont. I saw the hills and
forests and heard the chatter of those
clear brooks where the trout played; I
felt once more the sweet damp of the
woodlands, and a touch of the breeze
which fans those cool green mountains
from which I was now so far removed.
And when I had thus rested a moment
I wiped my. damp eyes and pulled my
self together.
I left the; men In as good humor as
possible, though I saw they thought I
knew. more than might have bean ex
pected, and rode carelessly back to the
barracks. I would find trace of Kim
even if I met Oranoff himself. I called
for Kim's captain, but when he cams I
found he knew less than nothing.
. Kim Ling had disappeared from hu
man' sight!
From a soldier I learned where his
mother and sister lived, and bo! te'l out
of the barracks on that % slight clew.
At the sate I met one of my legation
boys. " He knew me almost instantly,
and ran up saying:
"Go. slow; I bring you pinge (letter)
from Colonel Oranoff."
"Bring it to the great bell," said I,
and I galloped on.
The house of the great bell was
The man fell backward from me, his
eyes strained open wide; then he an
swered me firmly and gravely (and I
admired him for it):
"He is not and has not been here, sir;
but I am only keeper of the, tomb.
Have you looked for him at the bar
racks?" â¢ , ;
neral, for I learned from a paper that a
boat had sailed then for Port Arthur.
By this time I was ready to return to
the mausoleum in search of Kim, and a
fresh horse quickly carried me over the
three miles, driven by the anxiety that
filled my heart. The piece was still un
der guard, and it was only by good luck
that I was able to approach the mound.
Andorph was not there, but one of his
captains knew me and let me within
the lines.
The moment my foot touched the
mound, up which the officer led me, I
was beside myself with* excitement. I
asked anxiously for Kim Ling, but the
man could give me no Information. I
was surprised at this, but never for a
moment doubted that the officer in
command could do so.
The whole of the great basin of the
Phan lay at our feet as we ascended
this mound so beautifully set in the
midst of the plain. The view was more
'charming from this spot than from the
hills about, for the fog had lifted; and
things before shrouded In It now took
on their true outlines. But to my tired
eyes it wag common enough â the jjreat
sweep of the Phan, the crowds of huts
that lay along its banks, the odd boats,
some of them of large proportions,
which went up and' down carrying the
strangest sails winds even encountered.
Far beyond, the silk worm wound
along on the crest of the mountain very
like the crawling thing the Quelpar
tiens took it to be. Above It great buz-
Dulclne pressed her face in my hands
and arose and left the room,
zards were . circling, and on its side a
dozen forms in white were raking grass
for the winter fire. Kelnning lay flung
wide over the valley, the gray walls,
some of the legations, the Pagoda, a
new American house, being all that
could be seen, save the* dead level
of the graceful tile roofs or the
bushy straw roofs of, the poor.
On the other side lay Pukhan,
with the great wall of a mountain
fortress, surrounding on its summit a
space as great as that occupied by
Kelnning in the valley, a refuge for the
kings of Quaiparte who should be brave
enough to dare to run away â should
there ever come one so brave.
"Good morning,". I said eagerly to the
officer in command, . who was oversee
ing the erection of the roof above the
tablet; "may I see Lieutenant Ling?" -
The man started at my words. "Ling
is not here," he replied; "I have noth
ing to do with Lieutenant Ling."
"Kim Ling not here?" I cried out.
"No."
"Was he not appointed secret guard
ian of the Queen?"
The man gazed at me open-mouthed.
But I burst on. regardless of his sur
prise. I could not lose Kim now. I
could not go to the King!
"You are mistaken, sir," I. pressed
him. "Ling was appointed to office
here; I saw his appointment; after ask
ing the King myself that it be given to
him."
was by the swarm of officials at the
palace. But Oranoff could. ' I must see
Oranoff! x
While we talked of the King, Dejneff
was quite his old self, but the moment
I spoke of Oranoff he cringed and failed
me. I could not be balked, and would
not. :
"I must see Oranoff, Dejneff, right
away, and I wlU; I wish you would go
and do what you can for me." The
words seemed to take the strength out
of him, but he saw I was In earnest,
and he arose unsteadily and started lor
the door.
"But, Dejneff." I added, rising with
him, "don't let anybody know I am here
or have been here; not even Dulcine."
How I got those words out my lips I
cannot tell; yet I said them, and they
stopped him ' in i his tracks. But after
standing still a moment glaring down
his nose into his beard, he left me
without a word.
"He does not dare to tell/me Dulclne
has not returned," I said, as I dropped
again upon my bed.
/ Pak came in some time after Dejneff
had left and took away the empty
glasses. "When he came back I was
donning my best and brightest uni
form. Pak assisted me for a time in
silence, but at last he could not contain
himself, and the poor lad burst Into
tears, much to my surprise and to his
own great shame.
I soon learned that the servants knew
of the attack on Oranoff. They were
all frightened; some had even left the.
legation, fearing a mob would attack
us. /Â¦ But Pak was weeping because
Oranoff was injured, and more particu
larly because no one knew what was
the matter with him.
"Won't you get Hu Mok now?" he at
last said to me, drying his face on his
coat-tails. "Hu Mok. can tell what's
the matter with anybody," he went on,
uninterrupted; "last moon a man was
very sick in Chulla province, and no
one knew what was the matter."
"I will see about Hu Mok, Pak," I
said, conciliating him; "I am going to
see Colonel Oranoff now."
For Dejneff was at the door.
Concluded Next Sunday.
THE v S ANl>: FRANCISCO: SUNDAY. "CALL-
. The old ringer of the bell was stand
ing: in trie door of the bell house as I
came across the plaza to it. My boy
told him something of me, which made
him very friendly; to. my surprise, he
could speak 1 some English. He had;
been an old servant at the British Le
gation before receiving: his present ap
pointment, which was, to all: native
eyes, a most honorable one. He had ob
tained it through the influence of his
brother, General Ling.
I remained with old Kysang - from;
that evening until the following night
at midnight, and as I look back on
them those, hours were by far the
darkest in all my . ,Quelpartien ex
perience. Since Kim â¢ could not bej
found, I must await his return. There
was nothing else to doâ that is. unless
I went to the King. This I determined
I would not do for at least one more
night. I sent my boy again to Kim's
house to make sure that word would be
sent me upon Kim's arrival. He re
turned affirming that my wish would be
obeyed, bringing also the information
that Kim's mother was afraid of me,
and that Kim was now. away longer
than he had expected to be.
If ' Kim was delayed, for how long
would it be? I trembled to think that
Tuen might have entrapped the son as
he had the father! If so, I was wasting
each moment I waited for him, and
would better go to the King this very
night. By. force of will I decided notto
.go until midnight- of the following
night. If Kim came not by that time,
I would hurry, immediately to the Rus
sian Legation, where the King would
be withhla Cabinet, throw myself at
his feet, and tell all. .
And how did I live through the'ter
rible hours Intervening? In other cir
cumstances my stay of thirty hours
within that bell house listening to the
tales of old Kysang would have been of
utmost Interest. The house was, per
haps, fifteen feet square , and twenty
feet high. It was latticed on the v sldesj
and] roofed overhead. , In one corner
Kysang had a. little room and a fire.
Here I lay, sleeping or smoking desper
ately, while listening to the old man's
talk.
In the center of the house hung the
great bell of Kelnning. It was twelve
feet high, and more than half as broad

set up and It became a kind of a game
with them. Some of them were Â» col
lecting proposals from the poor unfor
tunate and every time they got to
gether at afternoon tea and gossip
fights they would exchange records and
the winner would receive a prize. One
girl had seventeen proposals from Har
old in one month and had the promise
of two or three more when he could get
around to her.
Harold had started out with the idea
that & man in an orchard should be
careful to select only the choicest
peaches. As he progressed down the
different rows and found all the desir
able fruit growing too high for him he
changed his mind and was willing to
take anything he could reach. But the
case here was as bad as on the first
trees that he struckâ all were clinging
too tightly to the parent bough for
Harold and he could not find even one
small overripe* peach on the .ground.
When any dropped he always happenrd
to be down at the other, end of the row
and some one else Invariably came
along and picked It up before he could
get in sight of the tree.
At /last. In sheer desperation, he be
thought . him that there were other
orchards In the world, where aperslat
ent gentleman might be ab!iÂ»* to do
something without a ladder. So he an
nounced that it was al! up with him
in . Stubbinsvllle and proceeded to hie
him to far Rhode Island to see what
he could do in a field where the ground
was not so closely worked. What fol
lowed Is a sad commentary on the
taste of Stubblnsvilli, or of Rhode Isl
and. He who hasthe courage to read
this moving tale may take his choice.
At any rate, HaroM , hadn't been in*
the new orchard a week before he had
gathered a peach from a tree two hun
dred years old.. To add to the discom
fiture of the Stubbinsville contingent
this particular peach which had fallen
into Harold's basket had a gold lining
and an attachment of railroad bonds
and oil stocks that made the best Stub
blnsville variety look like a last year's
crab apple.
Harold lives In ease and In a Fifth
avenue mansion and now when he goes
back tb ; Stubbinsvllle ] he , gives away
five dollar, bills with the same ease and
grace of manner with which he used to
give himself , away. It should be noted
further that; the Stubbinsville girls are
wondering how it was that they were
so . slow v to find out ..'. Harold's /good
points'' and are inventing new terms'df
feminine profanity to apply ; to; them
selves" when they, reflect on: how ,easily
and.' how" many tinies they might ] have
been i Mrs. Harold.
AH of which "goes to show J that i while
a" prophet may be without â¢ matrimony
In his :ovirn country he has only,, to step
over; the ; State line 'to ';' find * matrimony :
and > profit I too. " ;
WITHOUT intending any un
necessary disrespect to that
ancient and more or less
venerated Institution, the
matrimonial state, it might
be said that In some respects It resem
bles the righteous flea which no man
pursuethâ with very gratifying success.
Matrimony, like the other . venerable
and time-worn institution to which we
have referred, is -$ eldom to be found
where we look for it. More than one
man . has been compelled to lay | in a
supply of sackcloth' and ashes because
of his too confident pursuit of both
these elusive species.
This was the experience of Harold,
whose career we will now unfold, if It
Is not too badly creased. 'Harold had
an excellent reputation as a matrimo
nial hoodoo in the town of Stubbins
vllle. If any ambitious girl in the
place happened to be dreaming of do
mestic bliss with an oleander in a' blue
tub on the front porch she Immediately
changed her mind when Harold hove
Sn sight, and began to consider the
Joys of life In a nunnery-
It Is impossible to give any adequate
reason for this deplorable state of af
fairs. It must be accepted, like the
north pole and the ideal candidate for
the Presidency and the absolutely hon
est man; we have never seen any of
these things, ;but we know that tjiey
must exist somewhere. It's the same
way with Harold's Influence on the
matrimonlalexpectatlons of the female
portions of the population of Stubbins
ville. No one knew why It was. bad,
but the fact remained in the stubborn
manner peculiar" to unpleasant facts
like debts and bulldogs In watermelon
patches and other limitations of the
liberty of free born American citizens.
It was certainly! not Harold's fault
that he was such a blight. From his
earliest manhood he had been an as
piring candidate for matrimonial
honors and if there was a- girl In
Stubblnsville /whom he had not In
vited to come. and go hand in hand
with Â¦ him Â¦:; down the stream of life
it was because she could outrun Har
ald. '. He was constant, in season and
out of season, knocking at all the
doors on his beat and finding,most of
them locked. It was ho fault of his
that he was not married "three or four
times a week, and if all of his ex
pectations could have come within a
thousand miles of realization he
would have been married , so 'long' ago
that he would have got over telling
his friends what a bright thing 1 Har
old Jr. said -last night; : The first time
that Harold' essayed ; the running
broad jump to the matrimonial realm
he was met by, the old gag about ap
preciating the honor and all, that sort
of thing, but that a previous engage
ment would prevent the acceptance
of his flattering offer, and so on, and
so t on. , However,- the young . lady in
question assured : him ' that she would
try to be a sister to him.
â¢ i Harold vwas more or less cast down
by this unexpected ending to hia
manly efforts, but he was not dis
couraged. He remembered the old
saying which originated with the
snake editor? of the' Eden -Times that
the rejection of contributions Implies
no lack? of 'merit, and determined to
have another try at it The next time
he ' was a little more i diplomatic and
opened up the campaign by sounding
the young' "lady * on her general
attitude toward matrimony. When he
assured that she had no'partic
ularÂ¦â¢';prejudice against r . ( the state as

mixing his English and Spanish in the

men ashore told him of his danger.

THE origin of the Devil Is lost In
the obscurity of his early career.
We are not now referring to his
Satanic Majesty, but to a lesser
lightâ lesser to the world at large,
though far more brilliant to the little
sphere in which he lived and moved
and butted.
To the American soldiers who garri
soned San Ramon, in Northern Luzon,
and to the natives of the surrounding
district the Devil was a far more tang
ible object of comprehension than the
Â¦wider known prince of darkness, with
whom they had only an abstract ac-
Quaintance. Their Devil was a living,
moving, breathing power of evil, whose
evasion required the keenest control of
the physical senses, for wh-^n he came
on mischief bent it needed more mus
cular activity than prayer to get out
of his reach.
The natives had named him "Diablo
el Segundo." which means Devil the
Second. There were certainly strong
lines of comparison to merit him this
title. What the Devil may have been
In. the obscurity of his earlier life we
cannot tell, but as we knew him. In the
prime of his later career, his huge
horns and pointed chin, not forgetting
the cloven hoof, were strikingly sug
gestive of his namesake. The compari
son, however, was more than physical.
It was In temperament and in general
character that resemblance was strong
est.
When the boys of Company A took
San Ramon they found what at first
seemed an entirely deserted tc-wn.
Every man, woman and child had fled
with the last of the retreating insur
gents, and they had taken with them
every chicken, cat, dog. pig and horse
that the community owned. Even much
of the furniture had been carried away
from the houses. Evidently the Filipl
nos had decided to make their next
stand at some more advantageous
point, and as the men In khaki
marched in they expected no resist
ance. But there is where they made
their mistake.
The company lined up in the bis
shaded plaza and there proclaimed
American sovereignty by raising the
colors. This ceremony had just been
completed when there appeared a
startling apparition in the open doors
of the municipal town hall, facing the
plaza on the north side. A huge,
bearded goat stalked out on the steps
and stood for a moment regarding
them with a marked expression of dis
approval on his satanic face, Which
was in no wise lessened by the rem
nant of a soldier's castaway coat sus
pended from his massive jowls. This
was he who was yet to be handed
down to local fame as "Diablo."
Being native born, it may naturally'
be supposed that Diablo's political
tendencies were in favor of the Fili
pino cause. At any rate, having sized
up the enemy's position in the plaza,
he dropped the coat, lowered his
head and charged the line of dust
colored troops. At first a laugh arose
from the men, but as the champion of
the absent insurgents gained momen
tum in his wild charge for the com
pany center, some of the men shifted
uneasily, then scrambled quickly to
both sides, as the ponderous beast cut
his way through. Having missed the
sergeant who had been the object of
his eepeclal attack, he turned again,
and then the brown ranks wavered and
a wild panic broke loose.
The captain shouted commands to
which were attached ords not good
to hear, but this unexpected sort of
attack had demoralized all discipline.
The bandstand and the stone fence
rurroundlng bristled with men; only
the captain stood his ground. And
when at last the enemy turned on him,
he, too, dodged and sought refuge
with his men.
Having won " hat he considered a
complete victory, Diablo withdrew to
the end of the plaza to contemplate
the confusion he had wrought in the
enemy's ranks, proclaiming his tri
umph with loud noises that were more
bellows than the "baas" of his kind.
Evidently he was satisfied to rest on
his laurels, for when the men reas
sembled in ranks, he made no further
hostile demonstration and disappeared
behind the walls of the municipal
town hall.
Next day he appeared again, but In
a more peaceful mood. The first ser
geant approached him with a wisp of
straw, and thla Diablo accepted as a
peace offering. Later he came over
to the barracks and mingled with the
men, and while some were for re
trieving the defeat of the day before,
the majority were glad to accept the
truce that Diablo offered.
Thus their acquaintance began. Di
ablo saw that these men in brown uni
forms were not such bad fellows after
all. and accepted their presence with a
philosophical equanimity not to be
disturbed by further serious strife. It
is to be suspected that his combative
ness of the first day was prompted
as much by a desire for personal glory
as by patriotic motives, for now that
he was accorded all the respect due
to a warrior of his caliber, he teemed
to think no more of his fighting com
patriots In the nearby hills.
Not long after this the native fami
lies of San Ramon began to return
to their deserted homes, bringing
with them their household goods.
They, too, were beginning to learn
that the Yankees were pretty decent
fellows, and, comparatively harmless,
except In flghL Perhaps Diablo
would have removed even this latter
quanuca'woh, but then ne could judge
only by his own one experience. He
had won where others had lost.
The Americans learned something of
Diablo's antecedents from the return
ing natives. He had been brouKht
there by a company of insurgent regu
lars from the Tagalog country as a
mascot. He had always been on fair
ly good terms with them, except that
he occasionally displayed a very hasty
temper when offended. He had strong
likes and dislikes, and his dislikes
usually outnumbered his likes. The red
trousers of the insurgent cavalry uni
form were especially distasteful to his
esthetic sense. There had been only
one cavalry officer in San Kamon In
those days, a Colonel Lala. who was
there on some vague mission for the
Tarlac Government, and he. or â¢ his
trousers, became the object of Di
ablo's bitterest animosity. Whenever
the colonel appeared in the plaza
Diablo's most intimate friends could
not hold him back, and the colonel
found it safer to keep indoors. He
openly advocated death for the coat,
but the discipline of the already half
shattered insurgent army was then too
loose to permit of such tyrannical pro
ceedings. With all his faults the Tag
olog regulars still had a genuine regard
for their camp follower. That he had
- not been taken along in the retreat
showed only how hard pressed they
had been.
As time passed Diablo became , ap
parently as used to his white asso
ciates as he had been to the -brown.
He formed a rather intimate friend
ship with the first sergeant, who had
been the object of his special animosity
the first day. Him he would sometimes
honor with a formal visit at quarters,
but toward the rest of the men, includ
ing the colonel, who sometimes came
up from Vigan, Diablo's attitude was
one of contemptuous toleration. If he
met them in the narrow streets he eave
them just one-half of the right of way
â not an inch more.
Diablo's attitude toward women wan
peculiar. â¢ It was a fact that any hu
man figure above a certain age that
wore skirls was an object to be ac
tively avoided. The Colonel's wife
came up from Vigan several times,
and at once made overtures of friend
ship to Diablo, but with calm dignity
he refused to meet her advances. He
showed no less aversion toward the.
native women. If he met them in the
street he carefully stepped aside with
a chilly politeness and allowed them
to pass.
But strange to say, when it came to
children, his prejudices underwent â¢Â»'
complete reversion. Small boys h?
could not endure. Little girls needed
no introductions to become his friends;
for them he even showed a marked
fondness. They might pull his beard
or punch his ribs or even crawl upon
his back, and he tolerated all with
a patience simply astounding in one
of his otherwise hasty temperament.
Bananas or turnips from their hands
were especially delicious. Toward all
of them he was distinctly paternal.
It was the one soft spot in his world
hardened character.
Little Mercedes, the daughter of a
local tobacco merchant, was once lost
for a whole day. The surrounding
jungles were searched ' by American
soldiers and natives for many hours
until near sunset, when she was found
some distance up the mountain, mak
ing faces and calling- names to the
nervous little jungle monkeys. Had
she been alone she might have been in
some danger, but Diablo was found
patiently watching her from under a
nearby mango tree. He had followed
and kept his eye on her the whole
day, and when they found her, he
abruptly left and trotted back to
town.
Thus months passes, and. except for
a few lively encounters with various
men, both Filipinos and Americans,
who were absent-minded enough to
forget Diablo's prejudices against cer
tain Â¦ peculiarities of dress, life In San
Ramon was peaceful enough. It was
not until it was rumored that the in
surgent guerrilla leader. Ttno, was
coming do-wn from the north that the
monotony of the tedious garrison life
was broken.
Then began the hikes into the neigh
boring hills. Several times the boys
had slight skirmishes with TIno's men,
but no great harm was done to either
elde. A few prisoners were brought
in and an American corporal was
Â¦wounded, but Tino's game just then
was to lie low until the rainy season.
One evening the officers were gath
ered at mess, when'a native boy came
in and silently delivered a letter to the
colonel himself. He opened it, read it
and then hastily excusing himself rose
and left the room. It was quite dark
as he made his way across the plaza
and entered the house of a local mer
chant, a rich mestizo known to be fa
vorable to the American cause for busi
ness reasons.
The colonel was met at the door by
the mestizo himself, who conducted him
into a rear room of the house. "There,
seated in a large cane chair, was a
second native, also a mestizo, whose
yellow face was none the more attrac
tive for a long, stringy, black mus
tache. As the two men entered he rose
and bowed.
"Dis ees Colonel Lala," said the mer
chant and bowing he left the military,
men together. The two seated them-'
selves close together and spoke in low
tones, the American listening mainly,
but occasionally nodding hia head.
Finally the native drew from an inner
pocket of his civilian white drill coat
a paper, thereby exposing the finely
Btrlped white and blue uniform coat of
an insurgent officer. He hastily rebut
toned the outer coat and ,Â¦ spread the
paper before the colonel on a small
table.
The two men were still examining
this paper when a noise below caused
them to raise their beads. In the rear
of the' room was a" trap door of light
bamboo, covering: "a stone S etepway
that descended to the â¢ basement. Sud
denly there came a louJ crash .with a'
splintering of glass: from between

Kalakaua was very near common born

could carrv . the mien of Olympian
Jove. The Idea of the divine right of
kings impressed him as being just the'
thing to fill a long-felt want in Hawaii.

which has been greatly contorted and
exaggerated in recent fiction.' he is pic

made the genus a modern Harlequin

dent the story is not lacking. The fight

factory cnaracter of the cprmg fiction
is the one mentioned in the foregoing
introductory paragraphs, "The Rain
bow Chasers." by John H. Whitson.
By his first book, "Barbara, a Woman
of the West." Mr. Whitson gave prom
ise of doing good work in the typical
Western story, but his latest story, has
shot beyond the mark of that promise;
it is as vigorous, as stalwart, a story
of the plains as any similar novel writ
ten, excepting neither those of Owen
Wlster nor of Hamlin Garland. It has
a strong, pulsing life to it and a cer
tain fine reflection of the. largeness and
f ruitf ulness of thÂ« country it depicts
which make it a story that holds not
only through incident but by its at
mosphere.
From his too earnest desire simply
to embellish the marvelously romantlo
annals of La Â¦ r *-"*ys life, Orcutt has
sacrificed every canon of story telling
as has been hinted above. So- closely
does he stick to the absolute chron
ology of -the' events in the life of his
hero that at times the thread of his
etory has to be suddenly dropped until
its central figure can go off and per
form some deed which history, says h*
performed on that day and month. Ha
goes to France and Versailles, not be
cause his going develops any crucial
situation in the story, but evidently
because history declares that he did
so do.'
After reading . Orcutt's "Robert Cav
elier" one cannot but be sorely disap
pointed, for he must feel that tha
author has sadly overlooked opportu
nities for a really fine story.

fÂ± LAS! fine feathers do not maks
rJ fine birds, nor rare bookbinder's
| Â¦â¢ craft a good novel. "Robert Cave
f ;â¢- lier," a romance of Sieur da La
Salle by William Dana Orcutt, Is per
fect as to tasty illustrations, delicate
decorative headings and fine typo upon
"heavy watermarked paper, but the
story itselfâ that is not much. The au
thor says that the life or the famous
explorer is .in itself a romance which
needs little embellishment to become a
narrative of the utmost fascination. He
therefore Droceeds to add here and
there a little of this unnecessary em
bellishment, always with a careful eye
to â¢ the records of the historiansâ too
careful, indeed, to make for unity in his
story â with the result' that he gives us
something which Is neither good fiction
nor good, history.
Mr. Orcutt must have realized when
first he sat him down to his task that
even a few years from the busy life
of La Salle contained so much of inci
dent and so varied a field of activity
that the narrow confines of one story
could scarce bring out of it all an un
broken.thread of unity. Either he must
take the' heroic figure of La Salle and
weave about it a romance which took
not too assiduous note of historical
fact, or he must endeavor to build upon
facts a superstructure of romance
which should bend to the conformities
of story structure. Orcutt elected to
do the latter, and hejias failed of mak
ing a good story by just tne measure
of his InabiJIty to fit the rules of fic
tion to the "recountal of facts of his
tory.
The raison d'etre of a romance of
La Salle must be the , compelling In
terest in his explorations alor.g the
Mississippi; that is what singles him
out from all the other worthies of New
France and not the fact that he was
at outs with the Jesuits or that he
was a commander of troops under
Frontenac. The epic significance of
his fearless Journeyings through path
less wildernesses and down waters
which had known the keel of no white
man's boat is what should be the key
note and the predominating strain
through all of Orcutt's story; that 13
the fetory in any romance of La Salle's
life. Yet in this novel, the French Voy
ager's journeys of exploration Into the
Mississippi country are treated only as
incidents; the account of his rather
colorless experiences at the court of
Louis Qua torze is given more attention
than his second > expedition into . the
Illinois country and his final discovery
of the Father of Waters. Instead of
devoting the whole of the story to tha
fascinating romance of exploration, of
bold advances into the darkness of thm
unknown, and the grappling with grim
powers of nature, the author prefers to
make those things incidental merely to
a very commonplace story of true lor*
under difficulties.
Facts Retouched
to Make Fiction
> OW â¢ that the spring freshet of
K I fiction is welling through the
J\| channels already worn smooth
I \ by t,he floods that have gone be-
I fore and the publishers tell us
#/. that the highwater mark for the
output of this season of the year has
been reached and passed, it is not
â¢without profit to take a gauge of what
has been given us to read and en
deavor to ascertain the character of
the fiction which will be the output
for the year. Though the publishers
aver that the fall books are the ones
that count the most, both from the
practical point of view of net profits
and from the standpoint of artistic
worth. It seems that the product of the
first months of the year indicates cer
tain formative tendencies in novels of
the hour, pointing to characteristics
which must be representative of the
whole output.
When one casts his eye over thÂ»
lengthy list of tales already published
he must be struck at once with the
preponderance of strictly American
6toriesr The fashion, put in vogue not
long ago. that favors tales of a strong,
racy American flavor, heightened by a
setting of local color, has developed
into a Bch^>ol of writing that bounds
itself about with geographical lines.
To the stories of New England, of the
South and West which were strongly
characteristic Â¦ of the fiction of 1903
there have already been made several
noteworthy additions â additions which
carry strength and may serve to fix
the style for many seasons to come
perhaps. Miss Ellen Glasgow's "The
Deliverance," like Frank Norris* "ThÂ«
Pit" of last spring, one of the first und
strongest books of the season, has the
powerful local flavor of the tobacco
belt of Virginia. "TiUie, a Mennonitd
Maid." Helen R. Martin's book, de
velops the Pennsylvania Dutch coun
try- Elliot Crayton McCants has
chosen the Carolinas for his "In the
Red Hills." "Henderson." by Rose E.
Young, has Missouri for its theater.
"The Rainbow Chasers" of John H.
Whitson Is a strong tale of Arkansas.
Thus the tale of the story of sectional
setting runs.
The novel of affaire â business, poli
tics, promotion and speculation â has
not had such representative exponents
as it did in the year past. Norrls* "The
Pit." Alfred Henry Lewis' "The Boss,"
Brand Whitlock's "The Thirteenth Dis
trict" have not been equaled
by Spearman's "The Close of
the Day." Brady's "The Cor
per in Coffee" or Robert Shackle
ton's "The Great Adventurer."
The story of bull and bear, as the
Btory of politics, has its limitations. It
would seem that all the opportunities
which these classes of* fiction present
have been exploited pretty thoroughly
and that the vogue must depart as a
passing fancy.
The historical novel, despite all of
the prophecies of the wise ones. Is with
us yet. True, it probably reached its
heyday with Weyman's rare tales and
the romances of Conan Doyle, Edward
Major and Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, but
Mary Johnston's powerful tale of thÂ«?
Spanish main. "Sir Mortimer," must in
Itself demonstrate that there is yet
some good that can come out of the
hallowed past. Besides her rtory the
Indefatigable Crockett has furnished
another Scottish tale under the cap
tion "Strong Mac"; Josephine Caroline
Sawyer has harked back to chivalry
for "All's Fair In Love"; "Robert Cav
clier." by William .Dean Orcutt, deals
with the period of discovery in Amer
ican history. "Order No. 11" is Caro
line Abbot Stanley's vivid tale of the
Civil "War. The historical novel has
evidently builded for Itself a place in
our fiction of no vcr v evanescent a
character. It undoubtedly fills a void
in the scheme of almost every reader's
literary appreciation, for, when well
written â save the mark when it is not
â It is something to awaken the imag
ination to healthy activity.
There is one class of fiction which
seems to be taking a new lease of life
unto itself and that is the fiction of
mystery, of the cabalistic and the im
aginative. Within the last three months
there have been published three rat
tling good detective stories, to say
nothing of the reincarnation of Sherlock
Holmes In one of the weeklies. Then
Dram Stoker has given us "The Jewel
of Seven Stars," certainly a book cal
culated to make one afraid to look be
hind his chair while reading it; John
Carting has written "The Viking's
Skull," grisly enough; "When It Was
Dark," Guy Thome's book, has a title
suggestive of its Etory. All of these
tales have a wealth of imaginative
power and strength of invention which
must make them favorites with the
readers. Judging from this strong re
vival of the school of Poe, Wllkle Col
lins and Gautler. it would not be a
wild venture to predict that the present
year is going to witness a distinct ad
vance Into favor again of this fascinat
ing style of literature.
The year is too young yet to permit
of an essay at the quality of the fiction
which Is to be given us. With London
and John Fox away at the seat of war,
Mark Twain rusticating In Italy, and
the ranks of the writers thinned by the
untimely deaths of Gissing. Guy Wet
more Carryl and Henry Seton Merri
man, some of the burden of amusing
the great reading public must fall upon
new and untried shoulders. The pres
ent season has been marked by a
greater number, of new authors who
have' "broken in" to fiction than ever
before. Ezra Brudno's name appears
for. the. first time upon a book which
has been one of the notable ones of the
spring seasonâ "The Fugitive." Eliza
beth Miller, another new comer, has
written something promising in "The
Yoke." Ellen Glasgow,, heretofore
somewhat obscure and not altogether
pleasing in her morbid psychological
stories, has shown by "The Deliver
ance" that she is now in a firm -place
and ; a writer to be counted . upon ' for
sterling work. All in all, the book year
of 1904 has opened auspiciously.
A story which may well be taken as

a quarter of a mile brought them to the
dancer's cabin, by which time her
moist breath had coated her face
frostily, while his had-.; massed- his
heavy mustache till conversation was
painful.
They did not talk at first, the man
and the woman. While the maid helped
Freda off with her wraps, Floyd Van
derlip replenished the nre^ and by the
time the maid had withdrawn to an
inner room, his head over the stove, he
was busily thawing out his burdened
upper lip. After that he rolled a cig
arette and watched her lazily through
the fraerant eddies. She stele a glance
at the-clock. It lacked half an hour of
midnight. How was she to hold him?
.Was he angry for that which she had
done? What was his mood? What
mood of hers could meet his best? Not
that she doubted herself. No, no. Hold
him she could. If need be at pistol
point, till Sitka Charley's work was
done, and. Devereaux's, too. Â£ ... .
There were many ways, and. with
her knowledge of this her contempt for

head on' her hand ?a fleeting vision of
her "cwn girlhood, with its mournful
climacteric and tragic ebb, was vouch

minded to read him a >esson from it.

told as she could tell it. Hutâ bah!

" To â¢ him it was very comfortable;
soothing his lungs with nicotine and
gazing upon her. It was snug, and
warm here, while down by the* water
hole began a trail which he would 'soon
be hitting through the chilly hours.
He felt- he ought .to-be, angry with-
Freda for the scene she had created,
but somehow he didn't feel a bit wrath
ful. Never gave the girl credit for'her
grit. He. looked lingeringly over her.
comihg back now and again to the
eyes, behind the deep .earnestness of
which he could not guess lay concealed
a deeper sneer. And, Jove: wasn't she
well put up! Wonder why she looked
at' him so? Did she want to marry
him, too? Like as not: but she wasn't
the only one. Her looks were in her
favor, weren't, they? And youngâ,
younger , than Loraine Lisznayi. She
couldn't be more than twenty-three or"
four, twenty- five . at most. And she'd
-never get stout. Anybody could guess
that the flrst time. ' He couldn't say

FLOYD VANDERLIP was a 6trong
man. apparently. Hard work and
hard grub had no terrors for him.
When he held in check" half a
thousand starving men, as he once did,
It was remarked that no cooler eye
ever took the clint of sunshine on a
rifle-sight. He had but one weakness,
and even that, rising from his strength,
was a negative sort. His parts were
strong, but they lacked co-ordination.
Now it happened that while his cen
ter of amatlveness was pronounced, it
had lain mute and passive during the
*yearE he lived on moose and salmon
and chased flowing Ei Dorados over
chfll divides. But when he finally
blazed the corner posts and center
stake on one of the richest Klondike
claims It began to quicken, and when
he took his place la society, a full
fledged bonanza king, it awoke and
took charge of him. He suddenly recol
lected a girl in the States, and it came
to him quite forcibly, not only that she
might be waiting lor him. but that a
wife was a very pleasant acquisition
for & man who lived some several de
grees north of 53. So he wrote an ap
propriate note, inclosed a letter of
credit generous enough to cover all ex
penses, including trouseau and chape
ron, and addressed it to one Fiossie.
Flossie? One could imagine the rest.
However, after that he built a com
fortable cabin on his claim, bought an
other in Dawson and broke the news
to his friends.
And just here is where the lack of
co-ordination came into play. The
waiting was tedious, and having been
long denied the amative element could
not brook further delay. Flossie was
coming; but Loraine Lisznayi was
here. And not only was Loraine Liz
nayi here, but her cosmopolitan repu
tation was somewhat the worse for
wear, and she was not exactly so
young as when she posed In the studios
of artist queens and received at her
door the cards of cardinals and princes.
Also, her finances were unhealthy.
Having run the gamut In her time, she
was not averse . to trying conclusions
with a bonanza king, whose wealth
was such that he could not guess it
within six figures.
When a man is free much may go
unquestioned, which, should he be rash
tnough to cumber himself with do
mestic tits, society will Instantly chal
jer.ge. Thus it was with Floyd Van
derlip. Flossie was coming, and a low
buzz went up when Loraine Lisznayi
iodp down the main street behind his
wolf-dogs. At that time they dined
royally in Flossie's cabin, on Flossie's
table iir.en, which caused the men to
say sharp things and the women to
V>e spiteful. Oniy Mrs. Eppingwell. the
captain's wife, did not hear.
Xot so with Freda, the Greek danc
ing girl. She had no cause to lore
men. but by some strange alchemy of
her nature her heart went out to wo
men â to women pJie had less cause to
love. And her heart went out to Flos
sie, even then traveling the Long Trail
and raring into the bitter north to
meet a man who might not wait for
her. A shrinking, clinging sort of a
Ftrl. Freda pictured her. with weak
mo-uth and pretty pouting lips, sun
kissed hair and eyes full of the merry
shallows and the lesser Joys of life.
Wherefcie she smiled, dancing one
night, upon Floyd Vanderlip.
Few men are so constituted that they
may receive the smile of Freda un
moved; nor among them can Floyd
Vanderlip be accounted. The grace he
had found with the model woman had
caused him to remeasure himself, and
by the favor in which he now stood
with the Greek dancer he felt himself
doubly a xn--v And a thin little
thought began to lift itself, and he
fell to m wondering whatever under the
sun he" had seen in Flossie, and to re
gret exceedingly that he had sent for
her. Of course, Freda was out of the
running. But Loraine Lisznayiâ she
was Just the woman. Her life had
been large; she could do the honors
of his establishment and give tone to
his dollars.
But Freda smiled and continued to
smile, till he came to- spend much time
with her. When she, too. rode down
the street behind his wolf-dogs, the
model tvoin 4Â» found food for thought,
and the nex. time they were together
â¢dazzled him with her princes and car
dinals and personal little anecdotes of
cmirts and kings. Ehe also showed him
dainty missives, superscribed "My dear
Loraine." and ended "Most affection
ately yours." and signed by the given
names of a real live queen on a throne.
And he marveled In his heart that
th* great woman should deign to waste
so much as a moment upon him. She
played him cleverly till he went away
dizzy with self-delight and sorrowing
for the world which had been denied
him so long. Freda was a more mas
terful woman. If she flattered, no one
knew It. Should she stoop, the stoop
were unobserved. If a man felt she
thought well of him. so subtly was the
feeling conveyed that he could not for
the life of him 6ay tvhy or how. So
she tightened her grip upon Floyd Van
derllp and rode dally behind his dogs.
And Just here is where the mistake
occurred. The buzz rose loudly and
mere definitely, coupled now with the
name of the dancer, and Mrs. Epplng- â¢
well heard. She. too, thought of Flos-
Bie lifting her moccaslned feet through
the endless hours, and Floyd Vanderllp
was invited up the hillside to tea, and
invited often. This quite took his
breath away, and he became drunken
with appreciation of himself. Never
was man so maltreated. His soul had
become a thing for which three women
struggled, while a fourth was on the
way to claim it. And three such wo
men!
But- Mrs. Eppinipw-ell and the mistake
she made. She spoke of the affair, ten
tatively, to Sltka Charley, who had
sold dogs to the Greek girL But no
names w*c-*Â» mentioned.
"A men- girl, Charley." she said. "I
am *â¢%!Â« she is. And she is coming into
i. strange country without a friend
when she gets here. We must do some
thing."
Sitka Charley promised his help and
Â¦went away thinking what a wicked
woman this Loraine Llsznayi must be.
also what noble women Mrs. Epping
well and Freda were to Interest them
selves in the welfare of the unknown
Flossie.
How. Miss Eppinewoll was open as
the day. Having taken Floyd Vander
llp'e measurements, she did not dare
this with him: but she was not- afraid -
to ko down into the town to Freda.
And down town she went. In the bright
light of day, to the house cf the dancer.
She was above the silly tongues, as
was her husband, the captain. She
Â¦wished to see this woman and speak
trlth ' her, nor was she aware of any
reason why she should not. So she

Twice Freda sent messengers up ' to
So Mrs. Eppingwell's thoughts of
Freda were un kinder than ever. She
wrote a note, addressed it to the man
in question and intrusted it to a mes
senger who lay in wait at the mouth
of Bonanza Creek. Another man bear-
Ing a note from Freda also waited at
that strategic point. .So it happened
that Fiord Vanderlip. riding his sled
merrily down with the last daylight,
received the notes together. He tore
Freda's across. No, he would not go to
sec her. There were greater things
afoot that night. Besides, she was out
of the running. But Mrs. Eppingwell!
He would | observe her last wish â or,
rather, the last wish it would be pos
sible for him to observeâ and meet her
at the Governor's ball to hear what she
had to say. From the tone of the writ
ing it was evidently Important; per
haps- â He smiled fondly, : but failed
to shape the thought. Confound It all,
what a lucky fellow he was with the
women anyway! Scattering her letter
to the frost, he mushed the doga Into
a swinging lope and headed for his
cabin. It was to be a masquerade, and
he had to dig up the costume used at
the opera-house a couple of months
ago. Also, he had to shave and to eat.
Thus It was that he, alone of all Inter
ested, was unaware of Flossie's prox
imity.
"Have them down to the water-hole
off the hospital at midnight sharp.
Don't fail me," he said to Sltka Char
ley, who dropped in with the advice
that only one dog was lacking to fill
the bill and that that one would be
forthcoming In an hour or so. "Here's
the sack. There's the scales. Weigh
out your owndust and don't bother
me. I've got to get ready * for -the
ball." ,
Sitka Charley weighed out hla pay
and departed,^ carrying with him a
letter to Loralne Lisznayi, the' contents
of which he correctly imagined. to re
fer to a meeting at the water-hole at
midnight sharp. -Â¦Â¦Â¦..Â¦
On Friday morning: Devereaux, the
official courier, bearing dispatches from
the Governor, arrived over the ice. Be
sides the dispatches he brought news of
Flossie. He had passed her camp at
Sixty Mile; humans and dogs were in
good condition and she would doubt
less be in on the morrow. Mrs. Ep
pingwell experienced a great relief on
hearing this. Floyd Vanderlip was safe
up-creek, and ere the Greek girl could
again lay hands upon him his bride
would be on the ground. Sitka Char
ley remarked incidentally that she in
tended Jumping out down river that
night with Floyd Vanderlip, and fur
ther ventured the information "that ac
cidents were very likely at that time of
year. â¢ .
An hour later Freda knew the elope
ment was to be pulled off on Friday
night; also that Floyd Vanderlip had
gene up creek, and her hands were
tied. -
She did know where he had gone?
Up creek? Good! Did he understand
her to say Mr. Vanderlip needed the
dogs on Friday night?â that he must
have them by that time? It was too,
bad. but it was the fault of the shame
less one, who had bid up the ' prices.
They had jumped 550 a head, and
should he. buy on the rising market
he would lose by the contract. He
wondered if Mr. Vanderlip would be
willing to meet the advance.
She knew he would? Being Mr. Van
derlip's friend, she would even meet
the difference herself? And he was
to say nothing about It? -She was kind
to so look to his interests.. Friday
night, did she say? Good! The dpgs
would be on hand.
He had given it out rather vaguely
that he needed the animals for sledg
ing lumber from the mill to his sluices,
and right here is where Sltka Charley
demonstrated his fitness. He agreed
to furnish dogs on a given date, but
no sooner had Floyd Vanderlip turned
his toes up creek than Charley hied
himself, away in perturbation to Lo
raine Usznayi. Did Ehe know where
Mr.- Vanderlip had gone.^ He had
agreed to supply that gentleman with
a big string of dogs by a certain time;
but that shameless one, the - German
trader Myers, had been buying up the
brutes and skimped the market. It
was very necessary he should see Mr.
Vanderlip, because of the shameless
one he would be all of a week behind
hand in filling the contraet.
It was nobody's fault except the
man's that Loralne Lisznayi at last
landed him. The way of a man with a
maid may. be too wonderful to know,
but the way of a "woman with a man
passeth all conception. Perhaps the
model woman's attraction lay in that
to the eye, she was a handsome ani
mal; peritaps she fascinated him with
her Old World talk of aalaces and
princes: leastwise she dazzled him
whose life had been worked out in un
cultured roughness, and he at last
agreed to her suggestion of a run
down the river and a marriage at
Forty Mile. In token of his intention
he bought dogs from Sitka Charley â
more than one sled is necessary when
a woman like Loraine Lisznayi takes
to the trail â and then went up the
creek to give orders for the superin
tendence of his Bonanza mines during
his absence.
She would not have been surprised
had ehe been taken into, the dancer's
cabin and encountered on common
ground; nor surprised had. 6he Been
taken in and flaunted in prideless ar
rogance. But to be treated as she had'
been treated .was unexpected and dis
appointing. Ergo, she had not caught
Freda's point of view. One cannot
understand defilement without laying
hands to pitch, which Is very sticky,
while there be plenty willing to-under-.
take the experiment. All of which is
of small concern beyond the fact that
it gave Mrs. Eppingwell ground for
grievance and bred for her a great
love in the Greek girl's heart.
And in this way things went'aloiig
for a month, Mrs. Eppingwell striving
to withhold the man from, the Greek
dancer's blandishments against the
time of Flossie's coming; Flossie les
sening the miles each day of the drea
ry trail; Freda pitting her strength
against the model woman; themodel
woman straining every" nerve to land
the prize, and the man moving
through It all like a flying shuttle,
very proud of himself, whom he be
lieved to be a second Don Juan.

door, with the frost at sixty below.
and parleyed with the waiting- maid
for a full five minutes. She had also
the pleasure of being turned away
from the door and of going back up
the hill, wroth at heart for the indig
nity which had been put upon her.
"Who is this woman that -she should
refuse to see me?" 6he asked herself.
One would think It was the other way
around, and she herself but a dancing
girl denied at the door of the wife of a
captain. .... Â¦ Â¦ â
"But how do I stand In" this deal?,
I've lost J4OQO worth of dogs and' a
tidy bit of a woman and nothing to/'
show for it. Except you," he added'
as an' afterthought, "and cheap you,

He cjosed on her wrist till it ..hurt*
but on her. lips a smile was growing,
and. she seemed to listen fntently' to
some outside sound. "There" was a Jingle'
or dog bells and a man's voice crying
"Haw!" as a sled took the turning and
drew up' at the cabin. ' ;. .'.j*: t ,
/'Now will you let me go to bed.?*!
As Freda spoke she threw open the
door. Into the warm room rushed the 1
frost and on the threshold, garbed in

flaming borealis, a woman hesitatf d.

When I went over to the roundhouse

never a word, but he looked a . great
deal. Neighbors task was to-, supply
the motive power. All that we had, un
crippled, was in the passenger service,
because , passengers must be movedâ
must be taken care of first of all. In
order to win a strike you must have
public opinion on- your side.
]V -waa the â¢eoond month -of. the
ttrflce, and not a pound of* freight â¢
had been moved; Sthings Â¦; looked |
smoky on the West End.
Tbc general superintendent happen- _
cdtobe with us when the' news came.
"You cant handle It, boys," said he,
nervously. "What you'd ; better do is
to turn it over to the Columbian Pa
dflc" Â¦-â¢,.' ;Â¦'Â¦Â¦' /- - -
Our contracting freight agent on the
coast at that time was a fellow so "er
ratic that he was named Crazyhorse. .
Right In the midst of the strike Crazy
horse wired that he had secured a big
silk shipment for New Tork. Â¦ We were
paralyzed.
We had no engineers', no firemen and
no motive power to speak of. . The
strikers were pounding our men. wreck
ing our trains and giving us the worst
of It generallyâ that is. â¢ when we
couldn't give it to them. Why the
fellow displayed his activity at .that
particular Juncture still .remains a'mys- "
tery. Perhaps he had a grudge against .
the road. If so, he took an artful re
venge. Everybody in the system with
ordinary railroad sense -knew ihatl our*
struggle was to keep clear of freight
business until we eot lio^ot "the'-trour Â¦Â¦]
ble. Anything valuable or, perishable â¢,
was especially unwelcome. '.S7-,.'V-<.^ V -.-^.'."
i But the stuff was docked and tjbaded
and consigned in our care beforeâ we Â¦
knew It. After that a refusal to carry
it would be like hoisting the V-hite B
flag, and that Is something whichsoever,
yet flew on the West End.
"Turn it over to the Columbian," said
the general superintendent; i but the/
general superintendent was not looked '
up to on our division! -He -hadn't"
enough sand. Our head'was . a fighter, ;
and he gave tone to every man under
him.
"Xo," he thundered, bringing down
his fist, "not In a hundred years! We'll
move it ourselves. Wire Montgomery,
the general manager, that we will take
care of it And wire him to fire
Crazyhorse â and to do . it right off."
Ann before the silk was turned over;
to us Crazyhorse was looking for an
other Job. It is the only case on rec
ord where a freight hustler : was dis
charged for getting business. â¢<**/
There were twelve carloads; It was
Insured for eighty- five thousand dol
lars a car. You can figure how â¢ tax
the title Is wrong, but you never can
estimate the worry that stuff gave us.
It looked as big as twelves' million . dol
lars' worth. In fact, one scrub-car'
tlnk, with the glory of the West End,
at heart, had a fight over the amount
â¢with a skeptical hostler. \ He main-,
tained that the actual money value,
was a hundred and twenty â¢ millions; '
but I give you the figures Just as they
vent over the wire, and "they are
right. ' i !.f;i
What bothered us most was" that
the strikers had the tip almost as' soon
as we had it. Having friends on every (
road in the country, they knew as
much about our business as,we.'our
selves. The minute It was announced
thai we" should move the, silk; ' they
were after us. It was a defiance; a
last one. .If we could move freight â â¢
for we were already moving passen
gers after a fashion â the strike .might
be well accounted beaten. ""V, - t
Stewart, the leader of the local con-^
tingent,. together. with his fellows, got
â¢ after me at once. , -â¢ . ; â¢Â¦-'/â¢
"You don't show much sense! Reed,"
Bald he. "You fellows here are break
ins your necks to get things . moving,'
and when this strike's over if our boys
ask for your discharge they'll get 'it.
This road can't run without our en-"
glneers. We're coing to beat -you. If
you dare try to move this. stuff we'll
have your scalp when It's over.- You'll
never get your silk to Zanesvljle. '' I'll
promise you that. And if you ditch it'
and make a million dollar loss, you'll

It. is then that you begin to appreciate
the great changes " which have ' taken
place in dress. You 'may follow her
further and see her buy silvered green
buttons and, later, you may watch her
purchase a light straw! hat with long
green feather. All the purchases are
in the height of style, but so extreme
that one must get used to them grad
ually.
"How will you make your sleeves?"
asked one woman of another after
both had been out shopping for styles.
Shopping for styles, by the way, -is a
fashionable pastime. .No goods ' are
bought, but you "go fronj. window to
window making notes and Jotting down
your selections. Then you pay a visit
inside. All . the different modes/are
noted and you take fun stock of every
style in the shop before buying. This
arduous task over, _. the. rest Is easy.
The fair shopper goes but next day and
purchases . the materials ; to ' make % the
gown which best suits her style and h'er
purse. Or she: selects,'^ after; she has
dreamed about it over night/ the -gown
which is most becoming , to l her. .
'But the making of, the sleeves Is the
most important thing of all,' for a gown
is judged not by its materials/ but: by,
Its sleeves. There are ten new/styles
of â¢ sleeves "and each of the ten r styies
has its own vogue. ...

But there '- a eleeve \ which â¢ is more
popular than either, the "leg of mutton
or the bagpipe, 'and . this ; sleeve Is the
one which Is very,' full, but is finished
at; the -wrist with a .wide band which
resembles . a cuff. This 'cuff-like arÂ«,
rahgement, far from being tight at the
hand,' Is very loose, . jihd ; inside j of it
there is* set a- very: wide lace frill. '.
:v This wide lace frill is a feature : of

'; The wrists of nearly; all the new

there are set lingerie cuffs; These Â¦iln

name suggests,' and Tare /knife plaited.

all prices up to $50. A* very good pair
can be bought made In the shops, ready,

a a r F English gowns were as chic
I as the French." eigbed Queen
I Alexandra to Mrs. Arthur Pa
set.
"They are and more." said Mrs. Pa
get, loyally. Then calling her maid she
ordered her to bring from her brough
am a large package which, carefully
pinned uÂ»> in wrapping cloths, lay un
der the seat.
Opening it, Mrs. Paget displayed to
the Queen's delighted eyes ' a gown
which, in all Paris, could not be beaten
in point of chic
"There is a skirt," said Mrs. Paget
"with a row of embroidery running
around It â so. And there is a cunning
lace coat, of half length, just over the
hips. There are cuffs and pockets and
there is a deep collar." But here words
failed, for both ladies were lost in ad- â¢
miration of one of the prettiest gowns
that will be seen this season.
Its material was only a butter col
ored Unen. ,But it was embroidered in
white. A wide band of butter colored
Insertion was let Into the skirt and the
white embroidery made a border at
top and bottom of the insertion.
The coat was made of piece lace. It
was tight fitting at the back and the
sides. The front hung open and loose
in a nappy manner, which - carries a
certain grace with it. The pockets and
the cuffs were deep and beautifully
embroidered in white and the collar
was done In the same way. Of course
the sleeves had their lace frills.
Mrs. Paget, who is the Queen's con- .
fidantc and favorite, went shopping
with her Majesty the other day. They .
shopped afoot and nearly bought out a
shop where handsome tubbable summer
goods are sold, her Majesty purchasing
gowns for herself, the Princess of
Wales, the Princess Karl of Denmark
and the Princes Louise. Mrs. Paget
bought a turquoise, a dove colored and
a sage green gown, in linen,- batiste and
latrn. And all the gowns were trim
xned with lace.
This fashion for lace trimming Is
leading its devotees along odd paths.
The spectacle of a woman of fine taste
and of very exclusive fashions in dress
purchasing Ught green lace" by the yard
Is no unusual one. And, If you follow
her, you will see her yaws from the
Is trimmed with'a great many rufflings
and ', is .. loaded with decorations . of all
kinds. It Is elaborate from the hand
somely embroidered skirt yoke- right
down to the deep ruffle, which is bor
dered with lace and used to trim the
foot of the skirt- ' j -'.-..
.The extent to which skirt' trimmings
are' used can hardly be overstated.
There are skirts so covered with trim
ming that the material of the skirt Is
scarcely visible. And over all there is
a deep fall of fringe which nearly con
ceals the entire trimming of the skirt.
The fringes of the. season 'are very
interesting and their uses are continu
ally on the increase. There' are now
whole coats, In" three quarter, lengths,
made of fringe. These fringed' coats
have a lining of taffeta and. the fringe
is put on over the .taffeta in' a. curious
\vay. It Js fastened at the neck, where
1 1 ' ts put on very full. '.It falls | to , the
bottom of the coat and is fastened in
place here and there with bands of rib
bon;: 'â¢".' Â¦ Â¦- 'Â¦'.-, Â¦ ' - r
.Fringe as a trimming upon summer
dresses will, be popular and will' be
seen, upon all the light goods. It .makes
ah admirable trimming for ruffles and
is quite delightful In a pale shade of
creamVcolbr upon skirts and coats of
the ;Â«same shade. â¢ Â¦
Parl s has come, out emphatically . for
white and ,. never since the days .when
the : white flag waved above ; the iTuile
rles'hasso much white been. see'n. ' In
; 1815 .: the fine dames wore* gowns . all 'of
white and , they carried . white . , fans.
Their Â¦ heads were dressed Â¦with white
: fullness of thehJps and back..,, The front,
was i plain', and -hung, straight In* ,bne '
wide,- unbroken panel. 'â¢ The skirt, whiclV
was for evening wear, "swept away long
in what is called. dip length. It was
three inches too long In ; front and at
least six inches too long In the back.
This skirt was cut with straight gores
which were sewed together straight up.
and down and chirred around. the top.
The band of the skirt, instead 6f being
pulled down in front, was buttoned^
straight around the waist. '*f
The bodice was : . cut like a shirtwaist !
with a point whtch was pulled down low
â¢in the middle of the' front over the skirt
band. Â¦ There were ruffles around the'
shoulders,' which were put; on to look
like shoulder capes. One fell well over
the shoulder and down over the arm.
The";" result was i charming/ f or : the
woman, instead of gaining flesh,by.put
ting ' on v, this "gown, seemed --.to grow,
thinner. > She actually gained In grace
as : she walked in this gown, and < that
sausagesque likeness which* afflicts the
fat. woman in a tight" fitting skirt dls-
appeared entirely. , ' v
The stout woman can wear the 1 1830
lines !f she will study them a little. She
can really add to her. inches not a little
and can make her hips less prominent
, by 'treating "them'ln a suitable way.'
M/A:. great change is taking -place in
shoulders. They are now, cut very Ions
indeed and are ten" inches and ' even a
foot deep. One pair of /shoulders hung
way down over the arm and made ju>
sort of shoulderet te. ] The epaulette" isâ¢
now : . old-fashioned and the . jhoulder
ette, made'by cutting the shoulder very

10TREATMENT OF HAIRY SKIN.
(Mary)â The use of lubricants, such as
cold creams, cocoa butter and vaseline,
cannot be advised except in very small
quantities for skins that s are at all
hairy, for all of them will promote the
growth of hair If used for any length
of time; but this does not follow on
faces not predisposed to an undue
growth of hair unless continual and
lavish applications are Indulged in. As
your skin does not chap readily, I would
suggest that you use glycerin and rose
water, "equal parts, and a little 'almond
oil when necessary to soften the skin,
or the prepared honey and < almond
cream, which will assist in keeping the
skin soft and white.' Peroxide of hy
dro&en will lighten the color of the hair
on the arms and after three or four ap
plications the hair will become . brittle
and much of it' can', be' brushed off. 'As
this treatment does not r destroy the
roots of the hair it must be repeated

after a time. Electricity is not prac
ticable when" so many hairs are to be
removed. A skilled dermatologist will
remove the moles and hairs"which an
noy you without leaving any apprecia
ble scars, but do not permit an ama
teur to tamper with such growths, for
scars will surely result.
MASSAGE FOR ENLARGED
PORES. (Forty-five)â With advancing
years the~ pores of the skin will enlarge
as the skin and muscles become . re
laxed. Scientific massage will take
away years of too ; apparent . age, re
storing vigor and elasticity to flaccid
muscles, and is- well worth an effort to
obtain. If this Is not feasible in your
location try home treatment for a time
and note results carefully. Remember,
however, the" old adage, "what Is one
man's meat Is another's poison,"' and
do not expect too much in a short time.
Keep at It persistently and results will
come so that the marks to time can be
held in , abeyance. From your descrip
tion I 'fear you have precipitated' the
relaxed muscles by too many hot baths.
Scrupulous cleanliness can be overdone.
Two or three hot baths each week and
a tepid, or preferably cold. If the shock
is not too great; sponge bath -each
morning, followed by a brisk rub-down,
will assist : in toning ' up- - the ~ relaxed
skin. Use warm water, but no . hot
water on the^face Â¦ and always rinse
with cold water. \ As a - tonic add ten
drops each? of alcohol and tincture of
benzoin to the rinsing water. v \ Pure al
cohol diluted one-half is very beneficial
to contract the ; pores 5 and may be ap
plied once or twice daily if it agrees
with you, for. allj people cannot use it.
Massage the face dally after cleansing,
using a 'cold cream. .,

Then, if you like, shake the finished
feather over a hot stove and the heat
will make it look a little lighter and
a bit more feathery.
And, by the way, an aigrette may be

you must be more than careful, as its
very stiffness Is frequently its ruina

And there is Just one more thing to
mention about hats. Chiffon facings
turn gray with dust and it is simply
impossible to brush it all out, and even
if a vigorous brushing would do it,' the
material is too fragile to stand such
treatment. Brush and shake out as
much as you can and rhen dip thÂ»
whole into alcohol and hang it up to
dry. If the material has assiynedT a
fair black, a sponge dampened with the
alcohol will clean it . nicely and not
take any of its natural stiffness away,
but either trick is simple to a degree
and frequently saves quite a sum, for
hats run into yards of this soft, shim
mery stuff without half trying.
with the hands so that their heat may
dry it quickly and evenly.
At this stage you will discover your
self with a clean feather, but not a
very prepossessing one. There are a
nt:mber"of ways to curl it and as one
â¢s nc* more difficult th-in another it is
about six of one and half a dozen of
the other. Some say sprinkle sugar on
a hot stove and hold the plume in the
fumes that will fill every nook and
corner of the kitchen in about two sec
onds, while others advocate holding it
over the spout of a boiling kettle and
then drying it with- the heat of a pas
etove or a powerful lamp. But neither
one of these methods will make thÂ©
pJume look like new, thjugh, to be
tme, it will assume a cjrtaiu amount
of natural fluffiness and not look be
draggled.
Curling with a? blunt knife is by far
the best way if you can be trusted to
handle both carefully, for the tiny
fluffs â¢ are rather brittle and break
easily, but if you draw them quickly
and easily over the blade, each and
every one will curl up and vie with one
another in seeing who can really look
the best. \
POINTS ON â MAKING SHIRT,

does' not take kindly to shirring or fine

A, GRACEFUL CARRIAGE/ (Laura)
âA graceful carriage . is within the
reach of . every j who ]wlll exert
will power. .To step heavily with head
bent or to. arhble along- with mincing
steps will niake'a fright of any woman.
Practic*"* walking each day with "your
Â¦mind "entirely Â¦ centered on the exercise.
This will enable you. to. keep the head
and shoulders in correct pose, and, by
wearing a short skirt, .'grace and free
dom of movement will be possible at
tho same time. " Lest you forget- you
might try the, plan of pinning a~ small
weight to*; the,. crown of, your hat in
such a manner that it will slip forward
instantly and remind you that'you are
bending your Â¦ head forward. Do I not:
go [to' the" other, extreme and' thrust the
chin upward \ and; forward. To ; correct
the ,; habit of holding' the . head to one
side, try.: carrying, a' small weight upon
the head when Iwalking about the house. :
A small bag, of ; salt is a nice Weight to
use. To balance 'Â¦ it .you will; be - com

manner and of carriage can only be
attained by concentrated labor Â¦. until

to carry the arms quietly, for \ a\con

. hence its proneness to enlarged pores,
blackheads and 'redness. Continual vig
ilance will, however, keep this feature
presentable if you will persevere in fol
lowing, the directions here givenl De
fective ' circulation, indigestion and the
harsh use of the handkerchief are at
the bottom of the' red nose, as a rule.
A brisk rubbing with a batl- mitten or
a coarse towel just before going to bed
will greatly assist in effecting a cure
by stimulating the circulation. Stop
your habit of punctuating your conver
sation by frequent pulling of the nose.
Not only is such action decidedly bad
form,. but in time it will cause a mal
formation of . the nose. Never neglect
'Â¦ Jhe nightly face bath, followed with
massage and a soothing lotion. Rub
the' tips of the first and second fingers
of both hands very lightly with some
good skin food to prevent an irritation
of the skin. Place the moistened fin
gers at the base of the nose and, with
a rotary movement, rjib upward, mak
ing six or eight revolutions, with a
straight upward stroke between and
over the eyebrows. Repeat fifteen or
twenty times: the glow thus induced
will soon banish congested pores. Â¦ The
: tip of the nose may also receive~a gen
tle rotary movement. The following lo
tion to be used once or twice' dally will
soon allay the redness of the nose, but
:be\careful not to get any of it into the
eye3. ... Take ~ one drachm of sulphate

COLORS AND COMPLEXIONS.
(Auburn Hair)â The old theory that
blue was the color for blondes, and es
pecially; for, women \ with auburn hair,
has long since been exploded. A better
. cultivation of artistic -tastes and es
pecially ; of color, " values .; has ] taught
women the fallacy of the blonde and
.bluV combination. '/{ As a matter of har
mony-fact, If the term naay.be allowed,
the sharp contrast of light brilliant blue
and auburn hair is most ; trying. Cold,
hard colors are rarely a success unless
selected by an expert, but: soft colors
with a hint of cream or golden hue are
most happy blending, as they'do so per
fectly with the color of - the ; hair and
the . For example: For
house and evening gowns select cream
white in pale or deep shades, and ecru,
with.touches of sage and moss greens,
delicate pinkish lavender, shades of
violet, nile green softened with plenty
of ecru lace, black' net, plain and span
gled, and black silk or black cloth for
. other v occasions. For street costumes
select shades of medium and dark
brown relieved with ecru, cream or
black, warm grays' with touches of
deep cream and black'or a blt;of rich
Oriental or Bulgarian embroidery. Mix
tures In gray and green or with ah ad
mixture of . violet, 2 brown, black and
green, and black and gray or white 'are
all-desirable and may be trimmed with
black fiber ..braid . in some of the' new Â¦
and 7 novel patterns.

FOR RAINY DATS (Business Wo
man) â The day has gone when any old
suit is considered good enough for
stormy weather. The wise woman
knows that she looks anything but her
best when buffeted about by the ele
ments with bedraggled skirts and fly
ing locks, and has set about in true
Amerlca*n fashion to overcome the evil.
The newest and most practical rainy
day suits are made of crave nettes cut
exactly like the modish walking suit.
The finish consists of machine stitch
ing, pearl or cloth buttons, coat collar,
inlaid with velvet or contrasting ma
terial and lining of gray clan plaid.
Storm serge, cheviot, frieze, water
proof and mackintosh cloths are also
in evidence. The skirts are gored with
plain stitched seams. or with plaits at
each seam. The side or box plaited
flounce mounted to the edge of a gored
skirt is popular, but not nearly as
practical as the plain gored skirt, which
may be ornamented by a shaped band
at the lower edge. All skirts clear the
ground two or more inches. Coats are
in short three-quarters length, loose or
fitted; also in. Norfolk and automobile
style, with and without shoulder capes.
When the wise woman dresses for a
rainy day she discards all petticoats
except one short underskirt and dons
equestrian tights to guard against cold.
Her hair is brushed and coiled "secure
ly, held with a few extra pins, and she
does not make the mistake of wearing
heavy shoes which will wet through
so that she is obliged to have wet feet
all - day. The sensible woman puts on
overshoes or sandals, and she selects a
smart walking .hat free from display
and. perishable trimmings,' and- ona
which will fit the head securely. \ A'
veil of rather close mesh net or chiffon
worn "over the face and pinned secure
ly, with free short ends, keeps the hair
tidy, while a neat umbrella and stout
dark gloves complete the sensible toilet.
RED MARKS ON FACE (Cordelia)â
Too : violent treatment of facial erup
tions is usually responsible for, the dis
figuring red marks which are left after
the eruptions heal. In removing facia!
eruption* coax them rather than drive
them away. Picking at pimples pro
duces an irritation which only retards
thelr^ quick development and conse
quent quick ; disappearance. When a
pimple presents a pustulated point,
wash the spot | with warm soapy water
and .open "with a ' fine sharp needle.
Protect ''. the", "face from bruising Jby

clean piece* of white linen,"* then '< press

rtEL ter may now sigh a genuine sigh
& relief, for if she wills she may play
her own cleaner, for though she hates
tremendously to admit it, sending pink,
blue or white feathers to a professional
cleaner and paying fancy prices is
more of a luxury than the average
lassie can well afford to indulge in-
Flowers fade and soil quickly, chiffon
perishes with the first breath of fog,

the shining sun in the way of trim

created that droops as gracefully, that
is quite as bewitching or as universally
becoming as the flckle feather.
But really it isn't half as perishable
as you have always been led to be
lieve. The wily milliner tells you to
take it to her when it is out of curl,
but pray tell, why shouldn't she? In
the name of common sense is that not
business and who would expect
her to divulge her state secrets when
6he can charge anywhere from Â£0
cents to Jl 30 for an hour's vork?
There are tricks in all trades, you
know, and it isn't exactly the policy
of Mrs. Milliner, nor yet of her co
partner, Mr. Cleaner, to tell you how
extremely gullible you are, and if sou
but realized how easily that money was
earned you would be sorely tempted to
take a morning oft and earn It your
self.
Â¦Whatever you do, no matter how
email or insignificant the task, make
It a strict rule to do It well or else
you will always be coming to grief.
â¢ And Just because methods are easy and
the requisites simple, as simple as plain
soap and water, for instance, don't get
the mistaken idea into your head that
the treatment isn't absolute!/ scientific
> tnd practical.
Always be careful when selecting
bowls for washing dainty fabrics. Tin
Is not good, nor any metal for that
matter, as they are liable to rust, but
enamel ware or the brown bowls that
are commonly used to stir cakes up
are splendid and soap and water do
-not injure them in the slightest. One
more word of advice. Never put soap
en any thin material or anything, in
fact, that cannot be rubbed thoroughly
and well, for passing it over a board or
pressing it in the hands sufficiently to
get the soap out makes unsightly wrin
kles and creases and the material is
utterly ruined at the very start.
Instead, make a good tvlher of a
white soap and warm water. Pour hot
water over the soap and let it dissolve
until the suds are foamy and then cool
to the required temperature. When
your bowl is well filled dip the plume in
and out several times, allowing the
fluffy fiyabouts to become saturated
â¢and you will be surprised to see how
quickly the water will discolor and
darken. If the feather is much soiled,
and they generally are, this simple pro
cedure will sot be sufficient, but if you
will gently draw the tip through the
fingers as you would a handkerchief,
the plume will assume its old freshness
and not show the least s'gn of wear
or tear. *
Under no circumstances leave a par-"
tide of soap in it, for of a surety it
will be a sad. sticky looking affair â
too ashamed o* itself to hold its head
up and look yon squarely in the face.
Fill your bowl with clear warm water
and rinse it thoroughly and if you are
wise you will use still another water
to be positively certain that not a ves
tige of soap remains.
Shaking a feather often brings some
of its flufflness back, but it Is not the
wisest thing to do with a very wet
one. Â»-as the . baby feathers break and
hang their heads In a silly, woe-begone
fashion. When you take it from the
>. last water have a clean towel ready
and wrap it about the plume so that as
much water will be absorbed as pos
sible. Then In a few minutes pat it

trade. -It so happened one night that
a druggist found himself without the

he placed a bottle of red liquid in the
window with a candle behind it. Â¦ He

for means of Improving the sign. He
hit on the scheme of placing a bottle of
yellow liquid by the side of the red
one. and then surpassed his previous

ago. The gun weighs 28 tons, has a
total length of 37.2 feet, a bore of 9.2
inches, and measures 36 inches in ex
ternal diameter at the breech and 18
inches at the muzzle. It fires a 3S0

THE powerful weapon which we
Illustrate Is a good representative
of the latest improvements
which have been Introduced Into
heavy ordnance, with a view to secur
ing at once greater range, increased
penetration, and a higher rapidity of
fire, without adding materially to the
weight of the piece. The theory of
design and methods of construction by
which these results have been secured
are not by any means peculiar to this
piece, Inasmuch as they have been
followed by gunmakers for many years;
but the significance of this 02-Inch cun
ts that in It we see what is, perhaps,
the most successful combination \of
these qualities that has yet been . at
tained. Although this gun weighs only
23 tons, and has a service rapidity, of
fire of five rounds in a minute and a*
half, it has a. power of penetration at
3000 yards (the minimum fighting
range of to-day) approximately equal
to that of the 13V&-inch English gun,
of more than twice the weight, of a
dosen years ago.
The Immediate cause of this increase
in efficiency is the greater velocities
that are secured , with modern guns;
and the increase in velocity is due to
the enlargement of the powder cham
ber, the . use of slow-burning powder,
und the' lengthening of the bore, so as
to enable the . products of. combustion
as they are given off by the 'burning
to exert their accelerating effect : upon

It has been often asked whether or
not ducks can ' smell. Some hunters
cite from their experiences Instances
that seem to show ducks can smell,
others that ducks cannot. Now the nat
uralist would say that ducks, owing to
their habit, have no need to smell and
hence cannot. This rule is not infalli
ble, but generally holds good. Any
wild thins with such eyes as ducks
have does not need to smell. Nature
seems to have given birds a discerning
nose. A fox will look straight at a man
and not see him, even when only a few
feet away, provided he does not smell
him or the man does not move. A duck
will not only see a man standing per

sometimes eat the ants, 'and there are
even a few white residents who have
tasted them for the sake of experience,

not a habit with the aborigines to eat
the insects; they prefer to devour the

nests, s '
Capital ovens are frequently impro

In an article which appeared recent

explains the theories on which the

and what he expects to accomplish by
it. His plans involve the establishment
of stations for the transmission of mes

enough, what Mr. -Tesla proudly, desig
nates as the first of his commercial

only five are married under the age of
13. and only 108 under the age of 16.
Nearly S4QO married between the ages
of 16 and IS. The number of mar

of -i, when it was rather more than
26,000. After that age fewer and fewer
men married and less than 1000 mar
ried between the ages of 48 and 49.

old age.
In the case of girls there were only
58 marriages under the age of 14, and

The fact is that Japanese civiliza
tion is most conspicuously weak in thÂ«
matter of the status of women. Di
vorce Is easy. In fact the seven causes
laid down bv Confucius . are allowed.
One of these permits a man to divorce

the lower classes divorce is extremely
frequent. It is less "so among the up

tiently endures her lot, and Ieave3 the

It is a rare thing for a woman in
Japan to seek divorce, though hus
bands-frequently give sufficient cause.
The fact that the care of the children
would fall upon the wife should she ob
tain a divorce is a sufficient deterrent
to the mothers who are poor, and the
condition of extreme subjection suf

bined with religious training as that it
should be united. . Agnosticism is as

vided for. Those who are satisfied with
the present, system unamended would
find It absolutely the. same so far as
affecting themselves. â¢
before the Jaw and that the State,
under our system of government, has
absolutely nothing to do "with the re
ligious education of Its citizens. It is
interested in their secular and intel
lectual development, however, and de
sires that they should become as pro
ficient as possible in the arts and
sciences. In other words, the State
desires that its citizens shall become,
bo far as their ability will permit, pro
ficient in mathematics, geography,
writing, mining, law, medicine and
whatever will fit them to become re
spectable and useful members of so
ciety. It does not seek to direct what
religious creed they shall profess, or
whether they s'hall profess any, and
leaves religious matters â¢ absolutely
alone. Catholics find no fault with that
programme. They are perfectly wJll
ing to allow all their fellow citizens en
tire religious freedom, and ask no spe
cial privileges; they ask only to be put
on an equality in all respects with all
their fellow Americans in enjoyment
of all that the State has to give.
We know well that the public at
large believe that this Is provided for
in the present arrangement, but that
public ought to listen with respect to
the ten or twelve millions bf devoted
citizens when they declare that as a
body they cannot conscientiously avail
themselves of these secular advantages
offered because divorced from religious
instruction; and especially ought that
public to listen to this appeal in behalf
of conscience when the remedy pro
posed Is not to be at the expense of
other people's conscience, but where,
on the contrary, the conscientious con
victions of all others are carefully nro.
*y~r GREAT deal of misunderstand
f | ing exists among our fellow cltl
râ¢"| sens who are not of our faith as
X .to the changes which Catholics
desire in the present educational sys
tem of the country. You hear it said,
for instance, that they would abolish
the public school and substitute in its
place a system of denominational
schools controlled by the church. We
are told also by some of our mistaken
friends that it Is the desire of the
Catholics to control the public schools,
handling the money collected In. taxes
for their eupport, appointing the teach
ers and selecting the books ueed, ex
cluding the State from any voice in
these matters. Then there are those
who think that Catholics want a divi
sion of the school fund, giving them
their per capita of the school money
and allowing them to do as they please
with it without any State supervision
or control. The fact is that none of
tfeos* statements are entirely correct.
Catholics do not want to abolish the
public school eystem, but to extend it.
Public education has always been pfo
moted by the church, which founded
and maintained many of the great uni
versities and colleges of the world, and
which embraces among her religious
orders of both sexes many devoted to
teachings What we want is simply
that the present school system be made
in practice what it. claims to be in
theoryâ fair and equitable to allâ and
yet at the same time bo that the State
may profit by. all the religious forces
We recognize the fact r that In the
United States there is no State Church,

those branches which go, to make up
a secular education.
The State, by this plan, [would. control
secular : education as absolutely as it
does now, and it would bring under its
control and extend Â¦ ! the public school
system to^all the children of the State.
The schools in which no religion of

for secular /education, ho matter 'where

away with the everlasting, question of
sectarianism and non-sectarianism, of
reading and of not reading the Bible in

that Â¦ issue ever, disappear.

fight in mass. The rapid fire machine
guns would with such a target to work
upon annihilate such a body. The gen
eral principle of ; modern tactics con
sists in placing-in action at the, most
important points of attack a stronger
force than that of the enemy. The
commander, who by the rapidity of his
.movements can place in action at the
same' time and at the principal "points'
the' greatest amount of 'physical force
will necessarily win the victory.
The new tactics render it necessary
for a commander to have positive and
instantaneous means. of communicating
with every part of his forces, and hence
the Importance of the signal service.'-
The distribution of an army in a battle
may be: compared . to a great wheel,
with the rinV representing the firing
line, the spokes the lines of communi
cation and the hub the position of the
commanding general. Previous to 1898
the United States Signal Corps was, on
what may be termed a, "wigwag" Â¦
basis. Wigwagging is a very old sys
tem, and is still the emblem of the ser
vice, as represented; by the crossed
flags. The signal corps itself grew out
of the experience of the civil war, when
electricity 7 first established a place for
itself as a factor in / warfare"..'.. Both '
. armies used "a crude system of * telegra
phy with- such good results that all
foreign powers have taken lessons from
America in 'this respect.'.
The wigwag? or/ flag ; telegraph, has
been used successfully for distances of
twelve miles./ This, however, is' the ex
treme range and can only ' be accoiri-
plished with powerrul telescopes and
with perfect atmospheric conditions.
-Under, ordinary conditions the range is
scarcely more than .half as far. The
use of a torch by night with the wig
wag code, which was found so effective
during the civil war, is now obsolete,
a powerful flash lantern being used in
stead. ..The effective range of the torch
or lantern is about that of the flag.
The heliograph, or, sun telegraph, as it
is popularly called, made possible a
great advance in visual communica
tion. It is an instrument of great
range and consists of mirrors so ar
ranged that rays of sunlight may be
projected in any direction, a shutter
being used to intercept and control the
fla^h. Under good weather conditions
the heliograph has a range of fifty
miles and has been used for twice that
distance. While all these visual sys
tems have the advantage of simplicity
and mobility and require little skill to
operate, they are all at the mercy of
the weather. Â¦ So trifling an interrup
tion;, for instance, as the passing of a
cloud might destroy all communication
with"di^astrou3 results.
The ' efficiency /of the United States
Signal. Corps to-day is due to a provi
sion of the act of Congress in 1898.
This act specified that one-third of the
signal corps should consist of trained
electricians. As a result the corps at
once began to draw men from all de
partments of electrical work through
out, the country, and the army gained
the advantage of years of training in
the schools and in commercial life.
IN the advance of the allied
forces on Peking the signal
service of the United States
and Japanese troops, although
understanding scarcely a word of each
other's language, worked smoothly and
effectively together. The line of com
munication was carried forward in the
face of unprecedented obstacles. The
troops covered the distance in forced
marches, the country was unfamiliar,
host'le, atid, to Western eyes, uncivi
lized. Despite all these difficulties the
American and Japanese signal men
hurried forward with their wires, cut
ting through forests, swimming rivers,
resorting to every expedient. And as
a matter of historic fact, by the time
the troops had reached the walls of
Peking communication had been made
possible by telegraph with the coast
by the Japanese and the American
signal forces before the English or
Germans had ecarcely installed their
first stations.
An explanation of the working of the
American signal service will equally
well describe the workings of the Jap
anese corps. For some years the
Japanese in considerable numbers have
been studying the signal service of the
United States In this country, until to
day the service In these countries is
practically identical. Were any further
test necessary to prove the efficiency
of our methods the present Japanese-
Russian war would therefore be a very
gratifying test. The success of the
Japanese has been due in large meas
ure to the fidelity with which they have
copied America, and to the general effi
ciency of their service. The accom
panying photographs illustrate the
latest methods of our signal service as
put Into practice In some recent tests.
The last five years have witnessed an
Unprecedented advance in the efficiency
of the signal service. This revolution.
with all its far reaching effects, has
been made possible, of course, by the
use of electricity. The importance of
electrical communication of various
kinds has been demonstrated commer
cially for half a century, but it re
mained for the Spanish war to show
the world how indispensable is elec
tricity in war. It is scarcely necessary
to add that much greater progress nas
been made in the United States signal
service in perfecting these new meth
ods than in any other country. The
secret of this success, incidentally, is
the plan followed in America of enlist
ing the services In time of need of
electricians, putting them in
uniforms and sending them to the
front. As Von Moltke has said, "War
is the only science that lays under
tribute all other sciences."
The methods cf warfare ha\*e been
completely revolutionized during the
last few years. The signal service has
come to play^a more important part
than ever before, until to-day it is
practically indispensable. It is neces
sary to understand something of this
change to appreciate the advanced
\^ork of the signal corps in a modern
battle. Formerly a battle consisted cf
the- meeting of two great bodies of
troops, with success as a rule attend
ing, as Xapoleon said, the strongest
battalion. To-day all this is changed.
Battles are fought by vast numbers
of small commands. The marvelous
effectiveness of modern ordnance and
the skill of modern riflemen 'render !t
impossible for a large body of men to
Change the faces and uniforms of the
soldiers to those, of Japanese troops
and the same illustrations might serve
equally well to illustrate the methods
of the signal service of the Japanese
army. ,
The work these men were called upon
to do resembled closely -what they had
been in the habit of doing in civil lire.
The difficulties were, of course, greatly
increased, but since the best electri
cians in the country were engaged, no
obstacle was found unsurmountable.
The principal instrument of the sig
nal corps to-day, for field work is the
telephone- The rapidity with which
such systems of communication may be
installed ' is marvelous, especially as
compared with the work of foreign
armies, except the Japanese. In many
tests the signal corps has actually ad
vanced faster, completing their line as
they traveled, than have the troops,
even under forced march. If the coun
try and conditions permit, the wires
and batteries are carried in wagons. If
this be Impossible the electricians, with
coils of wire slung over their shoulders,
cover the distance on foot. It is de
sirable that the. wires be strung along
poles or on trees, but often they are
simply laid upon the ground, with the
expectation of being abandoned at any
moment and not recovered. ; As in thÂ«
advance on Peking, all kinds of ex
pedients were resorted to. When the
conditions make it Impossible to talk
over such lines, a "buzzer" system of
telegraphy is brought into play. A
hood is placed over the head of the
operator and communication is main
tained by means of the code/ Any ex
pedient may be used, but the line must
be "got through at all costs.
The chain of communication Is divid
ed, into three partsâ the permanent,
semi-permanent and the temporary or
flying lines. For* the permanent lines
the familiar practice of the telegraph
and telephone companies is followed as
far as possible. Semi-permanent lines
are used to connect the different com
manders with the base of supplies lo
cated behind the zone of active opera
tions. The temporary or flying lines,
used in the zone of active operations,
are intended to enable the commander
to be in instant communication with
every, division" of his command. The
flying-line is only a temporary affair,
likely to be broke at any time.

FOUL, fighting In the American
prize ring is nothing short of
amazing. It has become so
prevalent that both the fighters
and the. sport loving public have al
most completely lost sight of the rules
governing the game, until it would be
a positive revelation to fight followers
here if an English referee should be
brought over to officiate at a fight and
Interpret the Queensberry rules as
strictly as they are enforced in the
land where they originated. Nine
tenths of the fighters who are now
popular . favorites it is safe to say
would be disqualified before the con
tests had gone half a dozen rounds.
Of course, I wish it understood at
the outset that by "foul" fighting I
do not mean that absolutely vicious
and willful fouling of an opponent that
never falls to arouse an American audi
ence to .wrathful indignation, and
which It is only fair to say is very
seldom indulged in. but a technical dis
regard or perversion of the Queens
berry rules, which has become alarm-,
ingly common.
Indeed, to any one who has given the
Queensberry rules even passing atten--
Uon it. Is nothing short of amusing to
To begin with, the rules expressly
declare at almost the very outset that
there shall be "no wrestling or clinch
ing allowed." while those who place a
strict interpretation on rule five would
be astounded at the way it is con
stantly violated In the rlnigr here. It
reads:
"If cither man fall he must get up
unassisted, ten seconds to be allowed
him to do so, the other contestant
meanwhile to return, to his corner, and
whemthe fallen man is on his feet the
That is nothing short of an Imper
tinence. The Queensberry rules do not
allow of any agreement of any sort
between the fighters with regard to
hitting in the clinches "with one hand
free," while as to "agreeing^ to break
clean at the order of the referee" they
are left absolutely no option by the
rules. To an English referee such an
nouncements would be i,thÂ«Â»- height' of
ridiculousness. Â»
hear the announcement made irom the
ring side, as it is done 'with unvarying
regularity now, that "the fighters have
agreed to flcht under straight Mar
quis of Queensberry rules, hitting with
one hand free in the clinches," or
"both fighters ,have agreed to break
clean at the order of the referee."
form of foulfiig that the crowd is quick
to disapprove of, because - It savors of
the- rough 'Â» and .tumble order,' but an
other; hold , which . is Just ; as -bad Â¦ and
far' more dangerous : is the one I ; have
labeled' "the . clinch 'after, your oppo

disqualified, but in America it Is a foul
that 'creates' hoTpassIrig 'comment.'

Is down. For their benefit it might
be stated that he la down when he has
one . hand and one knee or. both knees
on ;. the floor, and at such : times his
opponent should retire to his corner, in
stead of standing over him, waiting for
him to get lip. But, on the other hand,

mgr under \ Queensberry rules. . If In
such, an event the referee Â» would
promptly disqualify both fighters there
would soon be . less of this form - of
clinching and more clean hitting.
Two other fouls that are regularly
passed without even a reprimand are
those I have shown under the title a
"clinch after a cross .counter" and
"holding opponent's arm" after he had
swung his right at the ribs. Neither
of these ! should be . permitted, and yet
they. are. under the fighters* agreement
to "hit with one hand free.'*;
round is to-be resumed and continued
until' three : minutes have expired. If
either maiw fails to come( to. thescratch
in the ten seconds allowed it shall be in
the power of the referee to give his de
cision in favor of the other;man."
- Both ' these j rules . are simple and
straightforward, without the peradven
ture of : a doubt. There can be' only
one -Interpretation. . Rule three .says
there shall be no wrestling or clinch
ing allowed. There is nothing whatever
in the rules about - "hitting, with one
hand. free," but in the foregoing" they
do expressly state that both hands
shall be free and there must be no
clinching of any sort, and yet how
often do we have the spectacle of both
men holding on with one hand and
slugging with the other.;
Rule five expressly states that when
one man falls his opponent must return
to his corner and stay there until the
fallen man Is on his feet again," when
the round may- be" resumed.* There is
no mistaking that rule; but how often
is it observed by either fighter nowa
days or enforced by the referee? Instead
we are invariably . treated ; to the sight
of the r transcendent slugger ravenously
standing directly, .over hls : fallen 'foe
hungrily waiting ! for him to show | the
first evidence of getting on his fee,t so
that he can smash him. again and finish
the Job before his opponent recovers
his senses. And with |. equal \ frequency !
we see the referee, instead of- ordering
the man to his corner' while the'other.
Is down, wrestling with the Impatient
slugger to keep, him away; from his
victim while the count Is being made. ?-, -
All this- is both, unnecessary, and un
fair, and under a. strict Interpretation,
of the rules is as \ much of ; a foul as
would be a low blow, or striking a man
when he is down. . Yet it ; is : a form ". of
fouling that Is constantly disregard
ed by the public and the fighters alike.
Note, for instance.' how .the discus
sion waxed wroth after; the
Corbett ; fight . as to ; hittingr, in ; the ,
breakaway, hitting with one hand free,
hitting in the '.clinches' and which side
the referee should.have stood on when Â¦
he forced the men â¢: apar*t Â¦ af terj each
clinch. In the. light of f. what â¢ I- have'
just said about Â¦ the rules on clinching
and wrestling,: ally such talk is mere^
tommvrot?'^|M^j^^P^Bg^^^^f^^
In the first place I the rules -. do '?, not
permit. the nnen r to. clinch, or ; wrestle; at
all, but; declare that, on the contrary.
; Then t there 5is .the^"choke V hold 1 '^se
cured while '"'a.] shifty., opponent ; is .duck
ing f but ; of } hiina's 'way, 1 but ". this is a
arms until, each can push the othei
away and strike out again. Indeed, It
is not a clinch in the ordinary sense of
the term.
The other I have . termed "a. fair
block," and it is /entirely permissible
under the strictest interpretation of the
Queensberry rules, for v while ; one fight
er is holding the other's arms he is do
ing it merely, with his open hand, and
the one . so held or-blocked, Is
more correctly speaking, is quite at
liberty to draw his arms back . and
punches he sees fit. This is a block
pure , and simple, and in no sense a
clinch. -:
But against these two are a great
number of "foul" holds ; that fighters
constantly, take advantage of. One of
the i most common is that . where both
boxers j after countering a. missing take
hold of each: other- with; their right
hands aroundUhe scuff of the neck and
thus hanging , on punch unmercifully
with their left hands free. ; This is what
they, mean when 'âÂ¦ they .- agree to fight
"with one hand free; in the clinches."
It is absolutely, unfair and. under, tha
Queensberry 'â¢"rules ''.cannot'" be Indulged
In, , no matter what the fighters may
agree between themselves. - ; ;.
Another common which is con
stantly allowed-to go unpunished,", and
v. hlch xs no less flagrant i foul, : is Â¦ the
one I; have Â¦ labeled "one man: fouling,
other fighting If air," in: which the- op
ponent who ;. is : getting .; worsted /clasps
the * other around â¢;" the_.neck I and *hansrs
on to save himself." The man who. has
thus been clasped > around; the neck is
quite right Â¦ in f ; banging away 'with ; his
free fists,*;; but It " is a strange and com
mon , circumstance ; that "the ' crowd : will
invariably I cry.i "t oul" - at) him * for hlt- r
ting izi the clinches. ?, Under. the Queens
berry. rules," . as I* have repeated, .there
can be ; -no ; clinches and .'It ' is ', his '" duty
to himself to keep ' on i punching' while
his I arms ' areV free^ .;. ; \ : '.:'â¢.. Â¦'"_ â¢"â¢' iA/
' Another _;Â¦ common violation . of ".the
rules, and , one i that should , be ' checked
rnore particularly/ than V any.' other,*.: is
what Is called : .Â£fjlylhgr>the i elbow." This
is ' absblutelyÂ«unfair/ and \ very .wearing
upon' thefman who* receives Uhe elbow,
and }Â¦ has Ydeclded ' more^than one * fight
inf favor 'of '.the r man7usihg his /elbow,
when f In * reality "r. he â¢ should i have *' been
initantly- disqualified for such tactics.;;
; they must keep on punching from the
beginning t to the end of the . found.
Both hands must be free. all- the iime.
If, when they do come to a clinch, as
is sometimes unavoidable, as I .will ex
plain ' later, the referee should not be
compelled to focce them apart by main
strength or to come between- them in
any wav from either side; they should
breakat his simple word. ' ,
Indeed, in London and England gen
erally the referee rarely ' ever enters
the ring at all, but takes up his po
sition outside and there passes judg-.
ment . and issues his warnings. This
Is eminently proper and quite as it
should be if the Queensberry rules were
carefully and honestly observed by
fighters generally. But what a sensa
tion such, a referee would create here!
And what a howl- there ; would be if
such a referee were to strictly enforce
the Queensberry rules under which our
fighters so glibly agree -to fight "with
one < hand; f ree", , or to â¢ J-'hlt In - the
clinches," and award the /fight against
the man who committed such 'Â¦ a foul!
' Nevertheless, if such .'decisions '^ were
made with more frequency; the sport
would become cleaner and; better; if
j>erhaps not so enjoyable to the great
mass of ring followers who must have

I am nonthinking of the little-mind
ed, scandal-loving' reader, who. feeling
himself hopelessly contemptible, hugs
to himself the consolation that all men
are equally contemptible. He is not
worth considering one way or the
other. We^wlll let him gloat over
stories, '/'discreditable â shameful to the
greatâ if he will. He is beyond the
reach of further harm. But to the
sympathetic reader, the portrait of a
great man as he lived and not as he
posed is helpful. > Let us see them as
they wereâ struggling, failing, conquer
ing men like ourselves with whom wa
can feel kinship. The laudatory biog
raphy presents its hero always. as a
Pharisee. The 'â¢ charm of Bunyan's
Christian was that he occasionally
skipped backward.' ,The place for the
consistently heroic figure -is the opera
and Btage.'. Not that all this has much
to do with the Creevey Papers. They
were not a, very heroic group, the men
that Creevey draws for us. -'But the
book is useful in helping to reveal the
littleness of people that the world does
ill in regarding as "great. Creevey
washes the paint from many of Uhese
gaudy figures, strips | them of the fine
clothes to which- they never had* any
right, and presents them to us; the
commonplace and often â¢ vulgar/ people
that hidden behind their titles they ex
isted. Snobbery, - fairly well paid for
the job, finds- it . to its - interest,, tfc paint
Its masters with a halo of airthe vir
tues round their head. It is well when
a frank chatterer* of the Creevey type
presents them as they really were, say

The Creevey Papers is' not, a book
to be taken' up and read straight
through. It .-would be like sitting down
to. read through "Pepys' Diary" or the
"Percy Anecdotes:** f I heard of a man
once who, starting at.page one and fin
ishing at page four hundred and thir
teen, read 'through conscientiously, not
missing a line, a work entitled "One
Thousand and One Gems " of â¢ British
Humour." Like poor King Henry, he
never smiled .again. It was not the
fault of the book; it was the fault of
the darned fool himself. The befek was
an exhaustive, comprehensive compen
dium. I have never heard a joke be
fore or since that was not in it. On the
shelves of thousands of hard working'
men and women it remains to this day.
a valued and serviceable friend. Bult
like Betsy Prigg's bottle, it should be
reached down' only when the reader
feels so disposed. This man sat down
before the fire with it. took it up to
bed with him, read it through without
a break, one gem'of British humor "after
another. It is alphabetically arranged,
commencing, with the free translation
of a Hebrew joke against Adam and
ending with a witty anecdote told .by
a famous statesman in the course of
a speech advocating the adoption â¬ of an
imperial zollvereln. The largest divi
sion comes under the letter C, which
contains all the jokes ever made
about cats and all the funny things
that have ever been or that ever will be
said by children.- But D, embracing all
the best known British humor con
nected with dogs, runs it pretty close.
Often, after a;, merry evening, .when
friends have sat around recounting
stories beginning: "I must, tell ..you
what Georgie said the other' night," or
"Well, speaking about retriever -dogs,"
1 have reached this book down from its
shelf. It is admirably indexed, the
groups being carefully arranged and
divided into their proper "subsections,
and with patience I rarely fall to trace
what .Georgie said or what - the re
triever did, to its original source.' But.
as" I have said, it is a book to be dipped
into, not read. !
"The Creevey Papers" Is a. book to
be read for half an hour and then laid
down again. It has not the spice of the
"Greviile Memoirs" nor. the charm s of
"Lord Hervey's" Reminiscences." Her
vey; was a keen observer, a fearless dis
sector and a brilliant; man of letters.
Creevey was merely an amusing Paul
Pry, a gossip- monger of the valet'or
der. But the yalet is of more service
to the student of history . than he ever
gets the credit of being. To his valet,
it is said, no man is a hero/ When the
hero mounts his prancing horse he dis â¢
appears from the valet's view. When
the valet sees him is when he Is pulling
off his socks. If one wishes to under
stand mankind it is necessary to know
not only the hero but the man. To act
the herd on the stage with the/Hme
light turned upon onejs comparatively
easy. The same actor I can be a hero
off the stage also. But^it does not fol
low of necessity; the two things are
distinct. A man can be brave on the
battlefield and yet be a poor thing _ at
2 o'clock in the morning. Phil. May's
henpecked lion tamer, crouching behind
the king of the forest, while 'his terma
gant wife outside the ,cage' exclaims,
"Come out, you coward!'*, is quite a
natural character. Bellsarius and the
Duke of Marlborough in their own
homes carried meekness to the verge
of imbecility. Statesmen, excellent at
teaching firmness to a nation, have
proved themselves mere fretful children
when face to face with personal dis
appointment. If the proper study .of
mankind be man, the /Study must be
complete. We want to! know how our
philosophers behaved when suffering
from the toothache.
ON" the advice of a friend who
knows an interesting. book when
he finds one, I have been dipping
into "The Creevey Papers." edited
by Sir Herbert Maxwell, and published
lately by Â» John . Murray; and have
gained, therefore, some useful knowl
edge and much pleasant entertainment.
It is not on everybody's advice that
nowadays I buy expensive books. I
know one dear old gentleman who used
to cost me pounds. On parting from
him I used to make a beeline to the
nearest bookseller's, my trouble being
lest the particular work about which
he had been talking to me should be
sold out. Later, grown more cautious,
I used to suggest his lending me the
book. But th,s was still worse for me.
I could avoid reading a book I had
bought and paid for. But a book he
had lent me. â¢ * â¢ I just had to
read that through from beginning to
end, or he would know the reason why.
It was no good my priming myself with
one or two reviews, and attempting to
confine discussion to the passages
quoted. He knew that dodge. He
would insist on taking me into odd
corners of the book where no one but
himself apparently had ever penetrat
ed. If I could rot answer, he would
Bend me back home with the book that
I fondly thought 1 had seen the last
of thrust again into my hand. He Is
a firm old gentleman. But, in these
later times, I also have learned firm
ness. I positively decline to read books
that do not Interest me. There are, I
know, existing in the world already
books enough to interest me for the
next one "hundred years. To this num
ber every year, experience teaches me,
some half a dozen are added that I also
with to read. For my requirements
this suffices. As it is 1 sometimes feel
doubtful of getting through them alL
I would I were a better skipper. In
telligent skipping is an art to be culti
vated by the lover of A great
lover of pictures I once ran against in
Dresden I could not persuade to visit
the gallery there, because he only had
one day to spare. "But you can see a
few of them." I urged. "No, I can't,
that's just my trouble," he replied.
I'm bound to try and see them all in
the time. I shall pet a headache and
remember nothing."
Some people have a penius for skip
ping. They will sit. down for a couple
of hour6 to Nansen's two volumes or to
Mcrley's life of Gladstone, and rise up
with the best part of the book inside
their head. I have a sort of- relation"
who always reads a book through from
the title on the fly leaf to the print
er's name at the foot of the
last eheet. She reads the intro
duction, she reads the preface to
the first edition. She prefers first
editions; it saves the reading of pref
aces. Bhe had had a certain book for
three days when I asked her how she
was petting on wJth it- "Oh, pretty
well," 6he answered, but without en
thusiasm, "I've finished the introduc
tion to the present edition and the life
of the author, and the prefaces to the
flret four former editions, and the list
of authorities. I'v e only got the au
thor's apology now between me and
the book." She reads the catalogue of
the author's previous works, the list of
illustrations, the appendix. Why she
docs this she herself cannot say. All
she knows is that if she doeen'tâ if she
ekip bo much as the heading of a chap
ter, her conscience grives her no rest
night or day. It is an odd sort of a
conscience. On all other matters, as far
as I can judge, it seems to be fairly
well behavedâ listens to reason, is ca
pable of seeing the other- side of the
question, has a sense of give and take.
But reading matter of any kind ap
pears to excite it. At operas we have
to see to it that she has not concealed
about her a libretto. Otherwise ehe never
looks at the stage, but will sit the whole
evening- with bowed head, poring over
the book. At one moment she is bent
double trying to catch upon the page
some stray gleam of light from a gas
jet in the gallery; the next minute,
with her back to the orchestra, she is
holding the book over her bead hoping
to get the lime light upon it. "Put it
down," we urge her, "Enjoy yourself
while you are still youngâ to say noth-

ly Great Britain, have a 6eries of
schools established at all the great
naval arsenals and battleship building
yards where the work of first select

divers and repairers is gone through

Dublin Castle Is merely the scat of
the Government in Ireland and has
no domestic accommodations except for
fiunkies and castle servants. It has
an interesting history, for around it
cling memories good and bad that are
intimately associated with the history
of Ireland and England, , as well as'
some of the most famous men of the
past and present generation. The mil
itary pol'ce, the detective department
and the secret service have their head
quarters here. The castle is the sym
bol of British rule in Ireland. It will
be the duty of the detective depart
ment referred to to provide protection
for the Duke and Duchess just as
Scotland Yard in London does for the
King and Queen: even more so, because
the Government in Ireland is always
doubtful of the loyalty of the Irish
people and especially those, of Dublin.
The Dublin people, in striking con
trast to other Capitals of Europe, are
the most rebellious against the Govern
ment. The Duke's father was unmer
cifully caricatured during his term of
office. It was said that he Was so par
simonious that he used to sell the fruit
and vegetables which grew around the
Viceregal lodge. He was depicted on
one occasion wearing a ducal coronet
standing behind a counter selling cent's
worths of milk and cabbage. The poor
man was at the. time in a "state of
bankruptcy'. It was twenty-five years
ago that the present . Duke's father
surroundings of Dublin Castle Is the
dingy little lodge in Phoenix Park
where the Duke and Duchess will have
to spend most of their time. It is an
insult to the dignity of a King and
Queen of Ireland to be asked to live
in such a place. Originally erected as
a keeper's lodge, it has been added to
and embellished at their own expense
by successive Lord Lieutenants, in
cluding the renowned Lord Chester
field.
cently, "to take a working interest in
English politics I will aspire to a seat
in the House of Commons, but that
will not be for some time yet."
' Since J. Pierpont Morgan took, pos
session of Aldenham Hall In Hertford
shire the poor of the surrounding dis
trict have had reason to appreciate his
charity and generosity. Being princi
pally fin agricultural district the re
cent wet weather has rendered outdoor
work almost impossible, with the result
that thi agricultural - laborers have
been in a bad way. Mr. Morgan in
structed his steward to make inquiries
Into extreme cases of -distress, espe
cially.* where women and^children were
concerned, and to see that their imme
diate wants were relieved. Soup, meat
and bread are delivered , regularly to
such persons, and Mr. Morgan is more
over interesting himself in finding em
ployment in other quarters â for those
who care to leave farm . workâ on the
railways and at excavating for tele
phone and telegraph companies In
towns.
"The woman of any position or cul
ture at all who objects to women smok
ing is nowadays a very rare person,
indeed," said the secretary of one of
these new clubs, scornfully. "Of
course." she added, "I could name a
dozen or so of \*ery decent women who
don't smoke themselves, but they don't
turn up their noses at women who do
smoke. The time has gone by for
that."
Just how far London's feminine club
dom will go in its quietly conducted
but persistent campaign for the eman
cipation of women from the ordinary
restraints imposed upon them by con
ventionality there is no telling. What
uiey aim at is to allow women the
same privileges in women's clubs that
are enjoyed by men .in men's clubs â
the right to do pretty much as they
please so long as they" don't Interfere
with the exercise of the same right by
other members. And they are getting
there fast. Tobacconists say that many
women now resent being offered those
mild and dainty cigarettes which are
manufactured especially for feminine
consumption- "Ladies' cigarettes, In
deed!" said one of them, when return
ing a box that had been sent her. "The
idea! I want something with some
taste in it. Let me have a box of
Egyptiansâ men's Egyptians!"
The "complexion ring" is the latest
result of the eternal search for costly
feminine novelties. The shape of this
ring and the color of the stones set
in it are made dependent on the shape
and color of the wearer's hands. In
accordance with this scheme, a lady
who possesses hands of exceeding
whiteness, and wishes to emphasize
that fact, would be provided with a
ring set with turquoises, and the shape
and size of the ring would be made
to conform to the length of the fingers.
Proprietors of beauty shops, however,
are taking advantage of the new fash
ion by declaring that by certain mys
terious manipulations and cosmetics
they can adapt the color and shape
of the hand to the ring for far less
than it will cost to get a ring to suit
the style of the hand. The lady who
wishes to be up to date pays her money
and takes her choice of the two meth
ods. Colored diamonds, it is said, will
be the vogue this season, especially
those of an amber or canary hue. Hith
erto diamonds have usually been cut
with "table" or flat fronts. Now it is
said they are to have pointed fronts,
which will increase their brilliancy.
LONDON, April 23.â "No smoking al
lowed except by gentlemen gueats" is
the significant announcement displayed
at the Ladies* Park Club, one of the
latest additions to feminine clubdom
in the fashionable West End. Its sig
nificance lies in the recognition of the
fact that in the absence or any prohi
bition to the contrary it is now as-
Eumed, as a matter of course, that a wo
men are free to smoke in fashionable
women's clubs. No such injunction
against feminine use of the cigarette
is found in the rules of the Ladies*
Athenaeum Club; the Ladles' Military
or Naval Club or. the Lyceum Club,
which have just been started for well
to-do women.
LONDON. April 23.â It has been dis
covered only recently that William
Waldorf Astor's views are rather oddly
divided on the subject of imperial and
local. politics in this country. It is a'
matter of common knowledge that he
is a Conservative in matters imperial,
and that he supports his views by gen
erous subscriptions to the Primrose
League and other institutions for the
advancement of Conservative propa
ganda. After the death of his daugh
ter Mr. Astor kept aloof from politics
for a time. Lately, however, he was
approached by the Moderate (or Con
servative) party In the London Coun
cil with the view of contesting a. scat
in Paddington, where a fierce battle
was to be waged for. the repossession
of two seats which the Moderate party
lost at the. election 'tnree years ago.
The leaders of. the- party -in- the > con
stituency were, however, almost dum
founded when they learned. from Mr.

LONDON. April 23.â His Grace the
Duke ef Marlborough, having become
verted In the ways of diplomacy since
Â¥ he entered the Colonial Office, is report
ed" to have said that there wasn't any
truth In the statement recently pub
lished here that he had. been selected to
succeed Lord Dudley as "sub-King" of
Ireland. I am informed, however, that
- the appointment has been definitely de
cided on and that it is likely to be of
ficially announced soon, thus gratify
ing the dearest ambition of the
Duchess, who, being a Vanderbilt,
rtev*"- lets go till she gets what she
wants.
There is plenty of reason for the
Duchess' desire to be first lady of Ire
land. The position gives her royal pre
cedence, entitles her to be addressed as
your Excellency, gives her a crown on
state occasions and provides her with
an actual throne in an actual throne
room.
It is no secret that at the coronation
festivities in India it came hard for the
Vanderbilt Duchess of Marlborough to
bow the kne*>. literally, to the Leiter
v Haroness Curzonâ Dukes being at the
' tup of the peerage and Barons being at
the bottom â to say nothing of the fan
cied social superiority of a Vandcrbiit
over a Leitcr. Yet the thing had to be
done, for the erstwhile Miss Leiter was
placed' Sn queenly rank b\\ her hus
baJMTfl position as Vice King of India,
::iid mere Duchesses had to bend low
before her. Even prior to this difficult
situation, it is said, the Duchess of
;>" a rl borough had made up her mind
that she. too. would acquire a vice
regal crown, have her turning at play
ins Queen and go Lady Curzon one
betterâ for the pout of Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland is the highest in dignity and
emolument under the British crown. It
te ;:Jso one of the most txpTnsrve, and
it'is only persons of unlimited incomes
â¢.hat can maintain It with the tone and
dignity tvilh which it i* identified.
SALARY A PITTAXCK.
The ?100.000 salary would hardly keep
thf establishment" in plain bread and
butter. Charity makes a large demand
"ii the resources of the viceroyalty. The
descendants of the old Irish and Anglo-
Norman nobility are people of intense
itrtistlc tastes, so that art. literature
? ;)d music have al?o large claims upon
tbâ¬ King's representatives in Ireland.
Sport, too. has to be supported, and in
rood times or bad the magnificence of
Dublin Castle functions has to be inain-
Ilaimd. Its balls, levees and receptions
ai'e on a par with Buckingham Palace,
and her Excellency the Lady Lieuten
ant is expected to comport herself with
ihp dignity and gravity of a Queen on
ttate occasions.
On presentation days â that is, when
. lady members of the Irish aristocracy
are to be admitted to her Excellency's
presence â she sits on a richly furnished
gold chair â¢ surmounted by a canopy,
and on her bead a crown. She puts on
her most dignified smile white Miss.
Mrs. or Lady So-and-So is introduced
by her Excellency's lady-in-waiting.
Each parses in front of the Irish Queen
and as she does so kisses her richly
hand. This performance en
titles the person ko honored to be ad
mitted into the highest society in the
kingdom. The names of such persons
to be submitted weeks before, so
that their characters and social station
may be carefully investigated.
During their terms of office Lord
Lieutenants of Ireland are supreme in
ell matters relating to government In
Ireland, and nothing but an act of Par
liament can upset their ' judgments.
Th*=y can pardon criminals, save a cul
prit from the scaffold â in fact, proceed
Very much as if they were real Kings
instead of sub-Kings. Even the Duke
Â«if Connaught. the King's brother, is
lower in the social t=cale than the Lord
and Lady Lieutenant. They have pre
cedence even of the Prince and Princess
of Wales as far as Ireland is concerned.
Her Excellency has a retinue of
servants. lad!es-ln-waiting. ladies of
the bedchamber and so forth, Just the
same a* Queen Alexandra, and they
have exactly the same duties to per
form. There is a chamberlain, who per
forms the same functions as the Lord
Chamberlain does for the King and
yuecn. On state occasions the Lord
mid Lady Lieutenant wear robes iden
' X'-al to those worn by the King and
Quren: the. same attitudes are Etruck
and *the same performances gone
through as if they were playing the
part at Buckingham Palace.
lltlSIl ABE EXACTING.
The frish aristocracy am a great deal
reore exa'cting In Maintaining ancient
riles and ceremonies than the English
and this is the reason that society
luoks upon a job in Ireland as no sine
cure. The Duke of Marlborough is
said by those who know him familfar
|y to be not much of a courtier, but
what he lacks â¢ in that way will be
more than made up for by the taste
the Duchess has lately manifested for
that sort of thing. The Duke, there
fore, like his late father, may leave
the administration of the Irish office
to the Duchess aad busy himself only
with the signing of proclamations for
the suppression of political agitation.
The only thing Is that there Is hardly
Hufficient work In that capacity for
'iim .to do at present. The country is Â»
suffering from a dead calm.
In striking contrast to the brilliant

dressed by the visiting grand officers.
The following night the grand officers
officially visited Columbia Circle in
Washington Square Hall in this city,
where eighteen strangers were ad
mitted by initiation and several appli
cations were presented. The reports
presented showed that the circle is do
ing well and that it has been initiating
candidates at every meeting for some
time past.
At the last meeting of El Dorado
Circle, Isis Circle, which has changed
its name to California, paid it a visit
to learn how the initiatory work
should be done. The members received
a first-class lesson, for jn El Dorado
Circle Arch Druidess Mrs. Louise La
caze and her corps of officers, together
with the central star team, do the Ini
tiatory work to perfection.
The picnic given by El Dorado Cir
cle at Fairfax Park on the second
Sunday In April was attended by more
than 600 persons. All had a most en
joyable time and more than a hun
dred prizes were distributed. This,
the first picnic of the order this sea
son, was strictly in- the nature of a
family reunion and was as orderly as
if.it had been a private outing.
On the occasion of the first meet
ing in May Grand Trustee Charbonier
will visit San Diego for the purpose
of installing the officers of U. S. Grant
Grove of that place, and it is probable
that at that time he will be called
upon to institute a new grove In that
place.
Fortuna Grove of Angels Camp -will
celebrate Druids' day on the first Sun
day in May. Grand Secretary James
F. Martinoni will on that occasion be
the orator and address the assemblage
in ,the Italian language.
Galileo and Alpini groves have ar
ranged for a joint picnic at El Campo
May 15.- These are the two largest
groves in San Francisco and it is ex
pected that it will be the largest
Druidic picnic of the season.
North End Grove had a picnic in
Germania Garden in ' this city last
Sunday. Â¦
membership of all other fraternal so
cieties in that place has been invited
to take part. Many of the societies
have answered that "they will be there
with bells."
The United Artisans, a mutual fra-
T^rnal benefit association, which has
obtained a strong foothold In the
Eastern States, Oregon and Washing
lon, has recently, under the super
vision of Assistant Grand Master Jen
nie McE. Galbreath, formerly of Ore
pon. established two assemblies in this
, |ty â San Francisco No. 200 and Sil
\er Leaf No. 260. These have already
attained a good membership, and each
is doing much in the line of enter
tainment to make the meetings inter
eating.
At a recent meeting of San Fran
Â»isco Assembly it was visited by Su
preme Medical Examiner Dr. J. B.
Dlmstead of Portland, Ore., who spoke
encouragingly of the order and the
pood work the members are engaged
in. He also paid a visit to the as-
Bembly in Oakland, where he ad
dressed the meeting.
Silver Leaf Lodge at its meeting in
Knresters" Hall, at 20 Eddy street, on

On Last Tuesday evening San Fran-

has under consideration a proposition
to arrange a public meeting and en

may learn something of the order,
and it is probable that Silver Leaf will
follow the example set by San Fran

Yerba Buena Lodge had a pleasant
entertainment in Odd Fellows' building
last Wednesday night, and notwith
standing the fact that this is one of
the very young lodges of the order
there was a good attendance and a
very enjoyable time.
Columbia Lodge at its last held ses
sion received live applications and ha.^
a number of others on the way.
Reports from Aurora and from West
ern lodges are to the effect that after <i
consultation the proposition to have
the two lodges join forces and work as
one has been abandoned and each pro
poses for the time being to work Inde
pendently.
Supreme Organizer Lew id proposes
to make a number of visits to lodges

Mission Lodge had a very interesting
party in Mission Opera Hall that was
attended by a large number of people
who have come- to the conclusion that
the lodge is a wideawake one and that
its social functions are very popular.
During the early part of the evening
the following entertaining programme
was carried out, and was received with
strong marks of approbation:
On the evening of the third Saturday

tioned, and with it came the following
story:
"We used to have a fellow." the
younger Cohan related, "who, didn't
care at all how a girl looked so long
as she could sing. He had that end
of the show to look after and would
have dumped some funny specimens 'on
us if we hadn't' looked out. One day
we were down South, and we had, as
usual, a half-dozen or so country girls
who thought they could blister Broad
way. One of themâ 'holy smoke!' what
a face!â sat there until all the rest were
through and then went up to th\
piano. I signaled to our man 'not at
any price,' but he asked her what she
could sing. She croaked, positively
croaked, 'Anything, what do you want?'
" 'Sing a scale, 1 the director re
quested. â¢
" 'Oh. I can't do that,' she said.
" 'Anything, then.'
" 'Oh, any popular song,' she said.
'I'll sing "Molly You'll Be Mine." '
"She did. I never heard anything
like it.
"Then she stopped. GIbest wont on
playing. He was the most cold-blooded
guy in the world. I had my head out
of the window.
"'Well." she said, 'well?''
"Then Gibest turned round and thun
dered: "Who told you you had any
voice?'
"The girl turned to her companion
and screeched: 'What did I tell you?,
I knew darn well I hadn't any voice!' "
. I don't know quite how the ; subject
of voices came up then, except, per
haps by way of Cohan Jr.'s sore throat.
But the "trying out" of voices for, a
musical comedy company was men-
George: "I shouldn't have minded if
I hadn't had to go out after the over
ture to sell my pictures."
Ethel: "You sold mine after the in
termission, 'Little Josie, the child artist'
â what good times we used to have!
There was one thing brother hated,"
to me, and Miss Cohan's mischievous
blue eyes snapped most mischievously.
"He and I used to have a turn together,
dressed as girls, accordion pleated
dresses. Brother was very pretty then,
golden hair, pink cheeks and so on, and
made up into a very pretty girl. But
at the last of the act he would always
drop his voice 'way down, like this"â
Miss Cohan struck a deep, deep C â "to
show that 1Â»* was a boy."
Papa contributed then: "He was one
of the first of 'Peck's Bad Boys,' and
the critics used to say he made a very
good boy for a girl." .
They all laughed at him then, with
the teasing, happy laughter of those
wholly sure of not being misunderstood,
and George M. threatened! counter
revelatioris. He went on instead to talk
of George Ade, for whom he has the
heartiest admiration.
"Ade's 'County Chairman' is the best
thing on Broadway now," young Cohan
said. "And he is one of the nicest fel
lows that ever happened. Quiet! You
wouldn't think he'd done or been any
thing for a moment. I remember when
I met him first, at a farewell supper
to Vesta Tilley, In Chicago. I'd writ
ten a sort ofâ you knowâ kind ofâ well
â anywayâ about, a thousand words of
farewell and appreciation of Miss Til
ley. It was a hit and Ade took it beau
tifully. It was something his kind of
thing, you know, and he came up to
congratulate, me afterward. ,1 was
never so pleased In my life."
"You want to do his kind of thing
some day?" I asked.
. "I couldn't," George M. said humbly.
didn't have any money either," George
M. added, irrelevantly.
"They began very young?" I asked
Mrs. Cohan then.
"Brother had an illustrated page in
the Boston Globe when he was 15,"
mother said, preening herself, mother
fashion. "It was a song, 'Inez, My
Shining Light.' "
"Have you got it here?" I demanded.
"You can get my works at any mu
sic store," the composer chuckled.
"But/that was not his first," mother
continued. "He wrote 'Why Did Nellie
Leave Her Home?" when he was only
11."
Josephine: "That was a bird.'
Papa: "Witmark published it."
George: "Only thing I have against
Witmark."
Josephine: "But I got the worst of
it; I sang it."
George: "Nay, the audience suffered
most."
Josephine: "Those were the days
when you were playing the 'cello."
From me: "The "cello?"
George: "I gave a living: imitation
of a pump."
Mother; "But it is a shame you don't
practice, dear."
Josephine: "And you used to play
second violin then in the orchestra,
'Little Georgie, the boy wonder,* I see
you now."
A charming feature of the farewell'
recital of Otto Spamer last week,, at
Lyric Hall, was the Waltz cycle of
Eong of Oscar Well's, given by the
Brahms quartet. The set, that Mr.
Weil calls "In Maytime," grows with
acquaintance, and was finely given by
the quartet. The songs have quite the
Schubert quality of spontaneity and a
gayety that well beseems their title.
Being Mr. Well's, they- are well made,
but better, well born. The composer
was indebted to the Brahms quartet for
a finished and sympathetic rendering
of the cycle. , In their handsâ largely,
I think, through a change in Its timing
âthe cycle had lost the effect of jerk!
ness, disconnectedness, noticeable In Its
first J] rendering ; at Berkeley some
months ago. " Althbgether, "In May
time" Is a 'delightful addition to the
mixed quartet literature. The Brahms
quartet consists, by. the. way, of Miss
Millie Flynn, soprano; . Miss Gertrude
Wheeler, ; , contralto; . Frank Onslow,
tenor,, and Homer Henley, bass. The
singers ,we.re less fortunate, particular
ly in intonation, In their Brahms gypsy
songs of the-, evening. Mr. Spamer
played with His usual technical ease
and sincerity several good. numbers.'
Owen Wister. the author of "The Vir T
ginlan," has written a preface to the
theatrical edition of his book in which
he discusses the desirability of the so
called book play. He says that on
every side you will hear the book play
condemned simply because it is a book
play. As if it were new to dramatize
stories. Mr. Wister gives a number of
examples of plays which many do not
know to be book plays. Among these
are "The Merchant of Venice," "Ham
let." "M'llss," "The Little Marchioness,"
"The Vicar of Wakefield," "The Cricket
on the Hearth," "Fanchon," "East
Lynne," "Uncle Tom's Cabin," "Rip
Van Winkle," "Ben Hur, "Drink,"
"The Bells," "Under Two Flags," "Ca
mille," and many other plays which
have been successful. In addition to
this list I would suggest Mr. Wlster's
"The Virginian" as a shining example.
Frank Campeau, who has made an
emphatic hit as Trampaa in "The Vir
ginian," has a remarkable gift for
training animals. Recently he has
been training a Plymouth Rock to play
the nart of Em'ly. In the second act
Em'ly is supposed to cackle and the
one who takes the part of the unhappy
Shorty also does the hen act. Mr.
Campeau, although finding no fault
with Shorty's cackling, believes it will
be more realistic for Em'ly herself to
do the cackling, which he^- claims his
Plymouth* Rock will '-> at his com
mand. The "Rock" will make her de

included in her repertoire with

She went straight to her daughter, un
heeding the interviewer, and asked
breathlessly: "How Is He?"
"All right, mamma dearâ" But Mr.
Cohan interrupted: "Wife, I Intro
duced you to Miss Partington. and you
go right away talking to Josie "
"Well," Mrs. Cohan excused herself
to me, with an I-know-you-will-under
stand-all-about-it air, "I haven't seen
the baby at all this morning."
George M.. slight, youthful, pale of
face, lazy of eyelil, fair of hair, sat
down silently a little apart from the
rest. Him I was more particularly
curious to see. As "a comedian he is the
limit of his dryly rapturous sort, as a
humorist almost as ready, as drolly
surprising as George Ade himself. He
gave me a sleepy eye for a moment,
then asked mournfully: "Can you tell
the truth? I've Just drowned your old
est inhabitant in a Market-street pud
dle, and I wanted to know if it were
going to rain any more."
I replied humbly lhat I never, never
prevari- '*fd on Tuesdays, and that it
might, rain, but that such cantankerous
conduct in April was really unprece
dented within the memory of etc., etc.
And could he tell the truth? I wanted
to kno\' how he had evolved his won
derful lopes and struts. His sister had
said
"That is the worst of interviewing
four people at once," George M. de
cided, "you have to keep track of the
other fellow's stories. How did I learn
to walk? Oh, one just drops into it ac
cidentally. I hope I don't contradict
ycu, sister."
"You!" his Eister laughed, proudly.
"It's this way, really. Suppose you
have a three week run, and only two
pieces, nothing for your third week;
you have to have something different.
And you simply"â zip! zip! She snap
ped her fingers, "go on and do some
thing different, new steps, new some
thing. It comes. That's it, isn't it.
Georgie?"
"Georgie" nodded, then negatived any
question if his study of dancing had
helped him to walk like anything from
a grasshopper to a confidence man.
"He never studied dancing; didn't
have to," his mother said, smiling over
at him; "his papa was a great dancer
once on a time."
"We don't let him now," said George
M., affectionately regarding his sire.
Then the photographer fiashlighted
the company, drawing out the remark
from Mr. Cohan that his last flashlight
was at his silver wedding.
"And now you're 58, father," said
his partner, "and I'm 48. Dear, dear."
"But I think women keep younger on
the stage than anywhere else." I ven
tured. ,v : /H
"That's because," George M. contra
dicted, "you haven't been on the Texas

Jerry J., otherwise Papa Cohan, drift
ed in first, "wondering where the chil
dren were." It was at the Columbia
Theater, and we waited in the "opera
plass" den for the rest. As Mr. Cohan
took the table to which i invited him,
he explained that "wife and daughter
hadn't had any time to buy things late
ly on the one-night stand route and
were shoppinp. But they would soon
be here. Son had no excuse "

"Why that's the way we women

here, for example. It hindered at first.
We wanted to go into Hanlon's theater
âthe Grand Opera-houseâ in Chicago
just about when we started. He would
n't take us. But time has its revenges.
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Han

and have to drive away again because
he couldn't get tickets. We were an

"Daddy!" It was Miss Cohan, a slim,

"daddy's" eyes, who' had broken in
upon us. "Where's mommer, and broth
er? I'm sorry to be late."
"You should be," "daddy" said, kiss
ing her, and then we all went upstairs
to the luxurious office of Mr. Gottlob,
with its gallery of actor photographs
and fat safe.
"I was tuckering over the baby,"
Miss Josephine informed me, tucking
her foot under her schoolgirl fashion,
as she plumped cozily on to the lounge.
"Your father told me all about
her "
"Her?"
"Born in Los Angeles, three years
ago." I recited glibly.
"Oh, that's Ethel's." Miss Cohan
â¢cried. "Mine's a bey!"
And I was sorry then for Mrs. Ethel
with only a girl! "Yours," I sait
aloud. "I didn't know that you were
married." -
"Very much so," Miss Cohan owned.
She is the wife, it appears, of Fred
Niblo, who "politely, proffers the Four
Cohans in the newest musical frivolity,

"Ethel and I were saying only last

"There's one called that, you know."
"I've often wondered where he got

Rudolph Ganz, a pianist of considera
ble note, and an accompanist â I have it
from Schumann-Heinkâ exquisitely ac
complished. Mr. Ganz is a member of
the Sauret trio, among other distinc
tions. There is no need to enlarge upon
either the voice or art of Madame Sem
brich in San Francisco. It is necessary
only to say that she will sing on Thurs
day evening, May 5, and Saturday aft

been unable to secure the three dates,

It is to be doubted if any singer has
made here quite the depth and kind of
impression that Madame Schumann-
Heink has made. Haply, however, this
warm and magic moment is hardly the
time to Judge. Yet I venture to pre
dict/that the Schumann-Heink spell
will be found to be extraordinary last
ing. Its secret, vital and adorable. Is
in the full-heartedness of her son?.
The singer gives her whole heart and
soul to you. Madame Schumann-
Heink, her voice, her method, her fame,
she considers not at all. Utterly with
out the singer's vanity, she never sings
a note for the sake of exhibiting that
note â yet the mere note how glorious!
Her every power, the big, splendid
voice, the large intelligence, above all
the great warm heart, are bent to the
interpretation 'of her song, and with
what delight in her innumerable illu
minations of the text she succeeds! I
remember no such utter exqulaiteness
of sympathy, no such complete charm
of self-forgetfulness, as the singer
showed in her "Frauenliebe ' und
Leben," given at the Saturday after
noon recital. How one would have liked
that other Schumann sorcerer. Harold
Bauer, at the piano! Herein, however,
in her single-hearted devotion to the
composer, Is Schumann-Heink's unique
and distinguished charm, and herefor
will she be deeply remembered among
us, a precious and perfect memory.
Her last programme held many
favorite numbers, a Schubert group.
"Die Junge Nonne," "Rastlose Li<?be,"
"Der Tod und das Madchen," and the
"Standchen." "Der Tod und das Mau
chen" â well, it was sung as Schubert
dreamed this pearl of songs might be
sung. The rest went nobly, least hap
pily, curiously, the "Standchen." A
Schumann group followed, with the
"Ich Grolle Nicht" and "Die Wld
mung," that aroused a tnunderous and
tearful appreciation that resulted in
Wolfs "Heimweh," that has found per
manent favor here.
Brahms â the programme was thor
oughly typical â came next. Is Brahms
to Schumann-Heink just what Schu
mann is? It occurs, at any rate, to
wonder. Nevertheless one need hear no
nobler "Sapphische Ode." no more
charming "Wiegenlied." that was sym
pathetically, if a little timidly, fur
nished with a viola obligato by that
accomplished viola player, Bernat Jau
lus. One again realized that the task
o?* making any tone count against the
splendor of the Schumann-Heink voice
is no easy one in the organ accompa
niments of Mr. Fickensher to the next
songs, the Raff "Sei Still" and a Reb
ling "Psalm." "What there was of the
organ was, however, valuable, and the
singer did the rest. Then the audience
bravoed and waved its handkerchief for
more, and madame returned to give the
"Lucrezia Borgia" "Drinking Song."
with epic gayety and a Russo-Hke top
note that eclipsed even the little tenor's
in length and sheer, handsome. Ltatin
bravado!
Most of us, I think, were rather sorry
that we had the Erda and Waltrauten
scenes, that closed the programme- It
is to be regretted that in this greatest
of all her phasesâ as a Wagnerian
singerâ Schumann-Heink cannot suit
ably be represented on the concert plat
form. But so it is. The "RIenzi" aria,
with its difficult emptiness, is worse
than nothing. These Erda and Wal
trauten scenes again clamor for the
orchestra, the scenic illusion. They are
heroically sung, but no one heard
snatches of the water theme, and this
and that snatch of the familiar mo
tives; one longed for the 'cello, the
horn, the . glittering fiddles that give
them. And then madame left, followed
by an adoring multitude to the vehicle
that conveyed her to her hotel.
As many people as the Fire Depart
ment would permit. Including a hand
some stageful, crowded to hear the
last for some time of Madame Schu
mann-Heink last Sunday afternoon
at the Tivoli. It was the kind of audi
ence one likes to be one of, the kind
the manager prays for, the kind that
must Infinitely gratify the person that
calls it out. And I think Schumann-
Heink liked her "auf Wiedersehen." I
know we liked hers.

"It is announced by Sir Wilfrid Lau

There were six Canadian sealers con

Something of a sensation was caused
here this afternoon by a report, spread
far and; wide, that the Chinese Minis
ter, Hoo Wei Teh, was , packing, up
preparatory to departing from St. Pe
tersburg, and visions of immediate war
were conjured'up.. The only foundation
for the rumor , was the fact. : that the
Minister, has' taken ; a summer cottage
at Gatshlna, .thirty miles from St. Pe
tersburg, for which place he will short
ly leave the capital:
ST. PETERSBURG, April 23.â In of
ficial circles nothing is known respect-
Ing the reported irritation in China and
the alleged desire of the Peking Gov
ernment to withdraw its Minister, here.
I am, however, enabled to state au
thoritatively that Russia caught the
Chinese playing tricks on several occa
sions and each time China unfailingly
received a smart rap upon the knuckles
from thi3 country, which, regime: will
be continued vigorously. It appears
that the examination of an officer re
cently shot as a spy revealed that he
carried passports granted at Peking.
Russia fully realizes the danger, of
China becoming engaged in the war
and is firmly, convinced that the one
way to check this complication is to
exercise severity, which is demonstrat
ed by General Kuropatkin's brusquely
worded remonstrance."

The new Greth airship ascended Into
the heavens yesterday morning and
demonstrated the fact, that under the
existing favorable weather conditions
she could be controlled at will by her
pilot. The ; first few minutes of her
flight were enilnently successful, and
but for a mishap to her motor power
she wctald undoubtedly have come out
with Â¦ living .colors. Even as it . was
she still stands a good chance of being
a top-notch competitor for the St.
Louis. Exposition $100,000 prize, and the
builders of the new big French airships
will have to get very busy with their
inventions if they expect to be in the
field with the local production.
. Unfortunately for the. attempt of
yesterday Captain T. S. Baldwin, her
navigator, who is a veteran aeronaut,
while he<is as much at home in the
air as a fish is in the sea, made an er
ror of judgment when he attempted
to manipulate the motor that was her
driving power. This is responsible for
what would otherwise undoubtedly
have been a complete triumph for the
inventor, Dr. August Greth.
Had F. W. Belcher, the engineer,
who Is a competent motorman, gone on
the trip, the result would probably
have been very different. As it was,
however, the inventor has much to
| be pleased with.
For the. last few days the "Califor
nia Eagle," as she Is called, has been
ready to- soar into the skies, - but the
winds have been prohibitive for a trial
trip. Yesterday morning the weather
was most propitious, and by 8 o'clock
.those .that j were directly interested In
the ship and others that came from
curiosity commenced to assemble
aro'und the tent-covered home of the
new venture. Everything was life, ex
citement and action. The great wooden
doors were hauled open, the canvas top
of, , the house was rolled back and the
df'jfcns of heavy bags of sand that held
tj f ship down were removed.
' HAULED INTO THE FIELD.
The great, elongated balloon was then
hauled out into the open field and
placed on the middle ring of what used
to be Ringling'8 circus. Here a great
crowd of people surrounded her and
hundreds of, Email boys assisted in
holding her down until she was ready
for the ascent. Engineer Belcher was
in the cage testing his motor.' while the
shining aluminum, arms, wings, pro
pelling screws, or whatever, they may
be called.were sent flying around with
tremendous velocity. 'Everything
worked to perfection, he announced.. Â«In
the . meantime Captain Baldwin was
taking off a bag of sand here and a bag
there, until. he had the weight adjusted
to a nicety. It had been previously ar
ranged that Engineer Belcher should
ascend with Baldwin, and he was pre
pared to do so.; but just as everything
was in readiness Baldwin told Belcher
to get out, as â¢ there was too much'
weight-In the cage. Baldwin then ad
dressed the crowd, stating to them that
this first trip was naturally- a trial to
test, the, working of the machinery and
also the carrying capacity, of the bal
loon. , He had 'outlined no especial
route. The trip might be 'successful
and it might not. This was only one of

PKK1NG. April 23.â All trustworthy
accounts from the main base of the
Russian army in Manchuria support
the view that General ~Kuropatkin is
clearing the country between the Yalu
and Liaoyans of every form of susten
ance for men and animals, preparatory
to a general retirement inland. Cattle
are being driven north in vast droves,
followed by wagon trains- laden with
food and forage. The inhabitants are
threatened with famine, and as many
as are able are migrating in a north
westerly direction.
It is estimated that General Kuro-Â»
patkin's force Is now close to 200,000
men. This number is regarded as suf
ficient for a certain amount of offen
sive action, but it is believed that the
Russian commander has elected to fall
back to the mountainous region^ about
Liaoyang, in order to, draw the Japan
ese across the extensive foodless.area
and thus come into grips with the
enemy.' under " circumstances favorable
to the Russian army. It, is apparent
that Kuropatkin feels' the: advisability,
if not the necessity, of be
yond easy reach of the" numeftHis^ flank
ing operations -Japan can '"engineer with 1
the aid of its triumphant navy. V"
ST. PETERSBURG, April 23i â The
Russians ' have placed guns
the crossing of the Yalu, River. -^ While
General Kuropatkin desires that the
Japanese shall/ enter Manchuria;'-: -; tie
purposes that they shall 'pay 'as ''dearly,
as possible for the privilege, but with
out precipitating a general engage
ment. Major General Kashtalinsky": is
anxious to engage; the . enemy . , and
begged General Kuropatkin for per
mission to do so, but the commander
in-chief strictly forbade even small
skirmishes where it was possible? to
avoid them. It is understood that-
General Kuropatkin intends to deliver
the decisive battle himself. In the
meantime' the cavalry and artillery
at the front . are engaged in , constant
drill and reconnaissance.
The story that an attempt was made
on General Kuropatkln's life by.jtwo
disguised Japanese while the com
mander in chief was in Newchwang a
few days ago is confirmed. The
would-be assassins impersonated Chi
nese beggars. They wore false queues.
One of them reached for a dagger, but
was felled by one of "two Cossacks who
always accompany the general."

LONDON. April 24.â The Foreign Of

ready to give them in East Africa.' This
is to consist of 5000 square miles of land
northeast , of Victoria Nyanza. It in
cludes the Nandl . plateau and is very
fertile, well -watered and well forested.
An important point .in the concession
is that the" land is only five miles dis
tant from the Uganda Railway and
thirty hours'- railway journey from the
coast. iSJSI
If necessary < It Is possible that the

concession ; still further, so. as" to give
the Zionist colony a port on the Vic

LONDON, April, 23. â Some .strange
and bewildering side lights are thrown
upon the .problem of crime and . the
criminal .' by a blue book Issued under
the name of Sir John Macdonald, mas
ter of the Supreme Court. 'During the
last twenty years there has ' been a
reduction in crime of the graver sort,
but,, he. points outthat every now. and
then, at fairly regular intervals, . there
is a wave of serious crime, which some
times extends over a half year arid
sometimes eighteen months.
The year ' 1902 .was one of a crime
wave. : In 1903 the total number of per
sons tried in . this country was 661,667.
while in 1902 the figures .were 787,676.
This increase was in / crimes
against property, while crimes against
public morals showed, marked decrease;
but, as Sir John , Macdonald pointed
out, all figures show that neither penal
servitude nor imprisonment- serves to
deter the habitual offender from . re
sorting-to crime, the -most incorrigible
of airiaing women.

believe that Sunday picnics are not

consequently have placed a ban upon
them.
Another important step was taken in
toe abolishment of all slot machines

by a county ordinance all machine
playing was declared Illegal. The

"While many of the papers seem to

CHEFU, April 24.â Private letters re
ceived from Port Arthur under date of
April 15 state that the Japanese bom
bardments of April 13 and 14 did no
damage to the town. No shells fell
inside the city.
Xot Damaged by Bombardments.
In spite of the reports from Seoul and
Tokio that the Russians are massing
50,000 men to resist the Japanese cross
ing the Yalu River, it can be asserted
with great positiveness that an obsti
nate obstruction of the enemy's cross
ing is no part of General Kuropatkin's
tactics. The Russians intend that the
Japanese shall have the river behind
them before giving battle in force.
Kuropatkin's plans in this respect are
fully approved here. Of course, the
Russians will do all in their power to
render the crossing as difficult and.ex
pensive as possible, but the first de
cisive engagement will occur in Man
churia, where the Russians believe they
will have all the advantage of position.
The Japanese fleet is again reported
to be off Port Arthur, but the report is
not official.
The Ruski Slavo prints a letter from
an official in the French service which
reports the presence of numerous
Japanese spies in France, well provided
with money. They shadow Russians
and watch the shipyards. Especially do
they endeavor to ascertain the exact
date- of- the departure of the Baltic
ileet and the points en route at which
It will coal. r :V' - : >
Â¦ The KovoBti states that the Russians
should feel gratified at the strategical
achievement of the naval . squadron,
"which imposed caution upon the Japa
nese operations and gave Russia time to
throw a preponderating military force
into Manchuria. The most favorable
time,' the XovoSti continues, for Japa
nese military operations has passed.
ST. PETERSBURG, ' April 23.â The
Government has no advices supporting
the rumor of heavy fighting on the
Yalu River. Everything is reported
quiet from the theater of war.
A rumor had been current In this
city that the Japanese sustained heavy
loss while attempting a landing near
the mouth of the Talu River. Accord
ing to the report, which was said to
have been based upon a private tele
gram from Port Arthur, the Japanese
lost 7000 men. The story was discred
ited in quarters where the press cor
respondents made inquiries.

ly convicted of having killed James P.
McCann, his benefactor. Judge McEl
henny set the date for the execution
for June 14, but later granted a stay
of execution until after July 23.
Barrington entered the courtroom
smiling and bearing himself with that
self-possession that characterized him
throughout his trial. When the court
asked him if he had anything to say
before sentence was pronounced Bar
rington replied:
"No, I have nothing to say, except
that I have not been given a fair trial.
I had. intended reviewing my defense,
but in deference to my attorney I will
say nothing more."
When the sentence was pronounced
Barrington almost collapsed. His face
became ashen and he sank into a
chair, his hands clasped in mute de
spair as he intently listened to his at
torney asking for a stay of execution.

MOUNT VERNON. N. Y.. April 23.â
George H. Primrose, the famous min
strel, and Miss Esther .tferney of San
Francisco were quietly married this
afternoon ln the Church of the Sacred
Heart here .by Rev. Edward J. Flynn.
The ceremony was witnessed by rela
tives of the contracting parties.
Primrose, who is known the country
over, is said to have made $500,000 in
Mount V'ernon real estate. He lives in
a pretty villa at Summit and East
Lincoln avenues, Chester Hill, the
fashionable section of Mount Vernon.
His first wife died last summer in De
troit. His present bride is well known
in California as a concert singer. The
couple met some fifteen years, ago
while Miss Nerney was being educated
in Yonkers Convent. When the first
Mrs. Primrose died she left her entire
estate to her husband, j Her will was
recently probated In the Surrogate
Court of Westchester County at White
Plains.
Primrose has a week's engagement
at Hammersteln's Victoria Theater, be-'
ginning May 2. after which he and his
wife will start on a three months'
wedding tour to the World's Fair at
St. Louis, and California. This will be
followed by a European tour.

The required reserve was augmented
$9,064,000 through the increase in depos
its, deducting which sum. from the gain
In cash left $6,899,500 as the increase in
surplus reserve to $34,203,700, the high
est of the year. Computed upon the
basis of deposits, less those of $56,205,
500 public money, the surplus is $48,255,
075. Public deposits showed a gain of
$13,800 and the circulation showed a
gain of $410,800.
NEW YORK, April 23.â The Finan
cier this week says: The striking fea
tures of the New York Associated
Banks last week were more or less im
portant gains in every item, making
new high records. Th,e surplus reserve
was the highest of the year, which fact
is important because of the probability
that the payment of the Panama canal
money will, now that the United States
has secured a clear title to the proper
ty, most likely soon be made. Loans
were expanding $1,136,000, which
amount was smaller than was expect
ed. The expansion probably, reflects
part of the corporation loans which
were effected in the previous ' week.
Specie gains of $9,963,100 cash, or, $2,
523,200 less than that which was esti
mated from the traceable movements
of money during the week. The dis
crepancy between the official and the
estimated gain may be accounted for
by the bank average system. Deposits
increased $12,256,000, which amount was
$842,300 less than the sum of the gain
in the loans and in cash. Therefore the
statement does not as closely balance
as has been the case in previous weeks;
this, however, may be due to the bank
merger, which became effective on
Monday.
The monitor Wyoming and the tor
pedo-boat destroyers Preble and Paul
Jones left Panama yesterday for Aca
pulco on their way to Pechilinque
Bay, where they will remain for sev
eral days and then proceed to San
Francisco.
PARIS, April 23.â The resolution
of the Panama Canal Company share
holders ratifying the sale of the canal
to the United States was adopted al
most unanimously. There were only
five votes against it.
The second Panama resolution was
adopted. There were only two; dis
senting votes. The^ meeting then ad

This completes the transfer Â«f the
canal to the United States.
WASHINGTON, April 28. â The
State Department has been notified of
the conclusion in Paris of the'con
tract for the sale to the United States
Government by the Panama Canal
Company of all its franchises ' and
property on the Isthmus. The money
for the canal company will be paid
over by the Secretary of the Treasury,
it is understood. Secretary Hay him
self will pay to the state of Panama
the $10,000,000 to which. It has be
come entitled. This payment will be
made in Washington to Senor Arose
mena, the newly appointed Minister
from Panama, as soon as the Govern
ment of that state authorizes him by
cable to accept the mdney. The au
thorities in Panama have become
clamorous for this payment, as the
money is 'needed to defray certain ex
penses already incurred In connection
with the creation of the new state.
The large fleet of United States
warships which assembled on both
coasts of the isthmus of Panama soon
after the revolution has been gradu

SATISFACTION
Â¦ In regard to the continuation of po
lygamous cohabitation Judge Powers
said that some look upon this condi
tion with tolerance and others with
open hostility.
Several Senators engaged in the dis
cussion of the future of polygamy and
Judge Powers said he believed the
practice could not last any more than
could slavery. Continuing he said:
-"But I don't regard polygamy as the
worst feature of the Mormon religion.
What I object to most is its un-Ameri
can domination by the hierarchy of the
people of that belief. The belief in the
right of the church authorities to pre
scribe rules, the belief that the head
of the church is inspired and inter
ference'of the church in political and
commercial affairs."
DIFFEHEXCE IN* VIEWS.
Senator Overman.
"I understand she did."
Senator Duboisâ Judge Powers, what
do you regard the chief exhibition of
church domination over political affairs
tha,t.has come to your notice?
"It occurred et the April, 1896, con
ference, when the political ruleâ that is,
the manifesto against Mormons senter
ing, politics without consent of\ the
J church authoritiesâ was* adopted. This
rule was adopted without a dissenting
; vote, and at the same conference Ho
ses Thatcher, was dropped from the
rolls. as an "apostle and no explanation
of any character was made.".
Senator McComas â How do the
young men in the Mormon Church re
gard the practice of polygamy?
"I think the young Mormon men, and
women, too, are opposed to the prac
ticeâstrongly opposedâ although I con
1 fess that I can not understand the
power the church is able to exert over
them. I believe, however, that if the
church' authorities should attempt to
re-establish polygamy, by revelation or
otherwise, there would be trouble."
When the investigation in the Smoot
case opened to-day, ' Judge. O. W.
Powers was again called to the stand.
He read a petition prepared by sup
porters of Moses Thatcher for Senator,
addressed to the Senate of the United
States, alleging that church influence
had been used in the election, and ask
ing for 'an investigation. Anotner in
stance of church interference had been
shown, he said, in the Mayoralty con
test at Provo, when Reed Smoot fa
vored the candidacy of George Souther
land. The witness said Smoot was
held in disfavor with the church and
charged with going to the Liberal
party.
Senator Overman asked Jf women
were elected to the Legislature in
Utah. The witnessanswered in the af
firmative and said a /woman was chair
man of the Judiciary Committee of the
Â¦House in the State Legislature which
'elected Smoot Senator.
jj "Did. she. vote for. * Smoot?" asked
CALL, BUREAU, HOTEL, BARTON,
WASHINGTON, April 23.â With only
one more important witness to be
heard hi the case of Senator Reed
Smoot, tentative plans were made to
day by the Committee on Privileges
and Elections to postpone action and
carry the final decision over to the next
session of Congress. A resolution will
be reported to the Senate, and adopted,
providing for a continuation of the
hearing. by a full committee or a sub
committee. .The same authority to
summon witnesses and/ take testimony
now lodged in the committee will be
given in the new resolution, with the
additional provision that the committee
may take testimony wherever it sees
fit. This means that it will go to Salt
Lake, investigate on the spot and make
another attempt to obtain the evidence
of witnesses now said to be in hiding.
Among those most certain to to
Salt Lake the coming summer are Sen
ator Burrows, chairman of the commit
tee, and Senator Dubois of Idaho, lead
ing member of the minority, who is
very deeply interested in the Mormon
question and firm in his opposition to
Smoot, on account of conditions in his
own-State. â
Jddge Powers admitted that Smoot j
had been prominent in working for Re
publicanism before politics in Utah di- Â¦
vided on party lines. It was brought !
out that Judge Powers was chairman
of the committee which nominated j
Brigham Roberts and Moses Thatcher, !
both of whom were Mormons. The wit- '
ntss said the nominations were the re
sult of the ability of both, men and i
their courage in standing out against !
the political rule of the church. ; The ,
witness said he had 'not been on ;the
stump for Roberts and defended ', himr
Continuing, " he said to Vancott; "I do :

.DR. GRETITS OPINION.
is Dr. Greth; vice president, J. McMur
do, and H. Shannon is the secretary.
The ship is 105 feet in length and twen
ty-five feet In diameter. The gross
weight of materials of which she is
made is 2200 pounds. It takes 40,000
cubic feet of gas to inflate her, and her
lifting power is somewhere in the vi
cinity of 2500 pounds. She Is equipped
with a De Dion Douton motor, import
ed from France, which works the twin
screws that are underneath the balloon
just in the middle. Her engine is of
twenty horsepower. Her propellers In
the present instance are made of alu
minum, whereas In the previous ship
they were made of sheet Iron.
The greatest interest was. manifested
on air sides in the success of the new
invention, and from- windows and
housetops all over the city people at
early morning commenced to watch for
"I confess I was not familiar with
"the motor, and was unable to start It
rroing again. This is the reason why
] rould not further continue on the
trip I had anticipated."
The airship was built by the Ameri
can Aerial Navigation Company, and,
as It stands to-day, has cost about $12,
000. The president of the corporation
NOT FA.MIJilAR WITH MOTOR.
Captain Baldwin said, while he was
standing by the ship on the marshy
flats where he landed: "Yes; the ship
is undoubtedly a success. As you could
see from below I was able to manage
her movements, and I gave you an
illustration of what ehe could do. As
toon as I started south, and just after
the had responded to her rudder and
was in every way acting in first-class
the engine suddenly stopped.
"The engine has stopped working.
Captain Baldwin does not understand
the manipulataion of the motor ma
chine, and docs not know how to keep
the mixture proper. He will not Â¦ be
able to start it again, because he does
not know how to do it. I am sure that
this is the cause of it. The engine is
all right, and if I had gone up with
it I am positive it still would be work
ing. I am perfectly familiar with all
the details of this machine, ana know
it is in first-class shape. I am terribly
disappointed that Captain Baldwin
forced me to get out of the ship JuBt
Rt the Instant that she was about to
*scend. I have never been up ln a bal
loon, but I know that my engine was
In such absolutely perfect thape that
had I been in charge of it the results
would have been successful. At any
rate, the ship shows she will be a suc
cess."
Dr. Greth was naturally laboring un
der a i great strain of excite
ment, and when the machinery
of the ehlp suddenly stopped he
was the picture of absolute de
spair. The other stockholders were
naturally pleased with the splendid
beginning and triumph that the ship
â¢ichieved at the outset of the Journey,
end expressed themselves as pleased
with what she had done up to the time
of the accident-
The engines were still working with
rreat vigor, but when they suddenly
teased a gloom settled over the inter
ested watchers below. Engineer
Belcher at once shouted out:
In the inclosure from which the
ship started on her aerial flight the
Â« rowd of spectators, composed of the
inventor of the machine, several of the
Ftockholders and the mechanics and
others that were interested in her con
struction, watched her leave the, place
of her berth. Expectancy was depicted
on every face as 6he quietly and gently
soared upward. Silence reigned. The
face of Dr. August Greth was a study,
rnd, as he saw that her machinery had
her well under control, his features
brightened and he felt rewarded for
the arduous and steadfast fifteen years*
vork he has devoted to his invention.
The young engineer, F. W. Belcher,
who had the placing of the motor in
the airship, -was also tremendously in
terested. When the ship commenced
to slowly circle in the air, showing to
the spectators who were patiently
watching her that she was under per
fect control of the navigator, a great
burst of applause went up from them.
ENGINEER BELCHER EXCITED.
The working part of the machinery
was entirely undamaged. When En
gineer Belcher learned about where
tlie shij> would land he rushed to the
scene as fast as possible. He examined
the motor and found it in perfect
shape and condition and at once ran
it at full speed as It lay upon the
ground. The ligrht, aluminum frame
of the craft was twisted at both ends
by the landing. The damage was
fcma.ll and a couple of days' work will
have the ship in running order again.
MACHINERY UNDAMAGED.
As it was, when Baldwin found ha
could not start the engine, he simply
let the shSp drift over toward South
San Francisco, letting the gas slowly
escape until he came to a soft, grassy,
half marshy spot near the San Bruno
load, midway between Bennett's tan
nery and the Contagious Diseases
Hospital. Here a big crowd of boys
and children had collected. They
grabbed hold of the long ropes that
were hanging from the ship and made
them fast to some piling. The ship
then quietly settled down upon the
turf. The balloon portion of the ship
was then partly detached and the gas
allowed to escape, and inside of ten
minutes after landing the shining yel
low t?ilk with its net covering was
rolled up into a small parcel ready to
be returned to town.
the many trips to follow. He then gave
the command to let go the ropes, and in
the juidst of the waving of hats and !
Sreat dieerlng iheshlp slowly ascended i
Jnto the heavens like an enormous bird. J
â¢JupI at the moment she started on her j
right a beautiful American flag was j
â¢ unfurled from her stem, which floated ;
fccacefully out on the eoft summer i
inornlr.g air. ""here was scarcely a j
treat h of a breeze, and when the
f^ip had mounted several hundred
feet Captain Baldwin gave an exhibi- I
tlon of what he could do with her.
DI2SCI11BKS CIRCLiES IX A III.
â¢ He turned her completely around, de
scribing circles at his will, while the
â¢hlnlng propellers fluttered In the
bright sunshine, making, at the same
time, a loud, whirring sound, equal to
the commotion created by at least a
dozen automobiles when ln full action.
"Then he started out on a southerly
course, and turning over her large can
vas rudder to port, she obeyed the heixa
â¢ and at once turned her course toward
Â¦ihc Pacific Ocean. During this time
she had been rising very fast and grad
ually running into coldor currerfts.
Suddenly the machinery stopped. This
wsÂ« caused by the inability to keep the
mixture of air and gasoline at the right
proportion. Had Baldwin been familiar
with the running of the motor, or had
Kelcher been on board, the results
would unquestionably have been of an
entirely different nature, and the ship
would probably have been steered back
to her place of starting.

LINCOLN, Neb., April 22. â The Su
preme Court of Nebraska to-day set
aside a decree of divorce granted at
Omaha to Mrs. Paul J. Schafer, for
merly of Napa, Cal., but now Mrs.
Herbert Beck of Sacramento, and by-
Its ruling decreed that the woman is
still the wife of Schafer, although she
has been living at Sacramento since
October, 1902, as the wife of Beck.
Schafer presented proof that his wife
had secured her decree by unlawfully
testifying before the court at Omaha
that she had established a six months'
residence in Nebraska.
Two days after getting the divorce
she married Beck in Council Bluffs,
Iowa, and accompanied him to Sacra
mento, where she and her two children
have since lived with Beck. Schafer
presented affidavits that he was a man
of good standing in his home town of
Napa, where he is now deputy post
master. He also proved that he had
served as private secretary to Con
gressman Metcalf and had held other
offices for many years.
Last pmmer Schafer found his eld
est daughter, 11 years old, walking
with a woman on the streets of Sacra
mento. He took possession of the child,
but was arrested for child stealing.
Then he found that his wife, who. had
suddenly left him in 1802, was the wife
of Beck. He gave up the child and was
released, after which Tie ferreted out
the facts concerning her surreptitious
divorce in Omaha. He immediately
took steps to have it set aside by the
Special Dispatch to The Call.

SUES CAPITALIST MAYNE
FOR PAY FOR SERVICES
Thomas R. Hayes Demands $20,000
for Looking Out for the De
fendant's Estate.
A suit to enforce a claim for $20,000,
alleged to be due for services rendered
Capitalist- Charles Mayne by Thomas
R. Hayes, was filed by Hayes yester
day. Hayes alleges that the money is
due him for his care of the $600,000
estate of Mayne during the latter's
absence from the State.
The action Is a sequel to a suit filed
by Mayne a few weeks ago against
Hayes, in which the recovery of
bonds worth $25,000 was asked for by
Mayne. . He claimed that Hayes and
his late son, whose administrator
Hayes is, invested for him, Mayne, a
large sum in bonds and failed to turn
over to him the bonds they received.
LONDON", April 23. â In v Bow-street
police court to-day Henry Slater, head
of the best-known private detective
agency in England, was held In heavy
ball, ' charged with conspiring to pre
vent the due course of justice. With
him in the dock were Albert Osborne,
his lawyer, and two private detectives
employed by Slater. They also were
put under heavy ball.
The case is a sequel to a sensational
divorce suit, in which Slater was em
ployed to secure evidence against the
husband. A decree was obtained last
November, but the authorities became
suspicious, and after a rehearing" this
week the decree was rescinded, the jury
finding that the husband was induced,
through the agency of Slater and Os
borne, to misconduct himself in order
that his wife might obtain a divorce.
The rehearing attracted great public
interest. Sir Edward Clarke and two
leading lawyers defended Slater,' but
were unable to refute the scathing ac
cusations of Solicitor General Carson,
who revealed the extraordinary meth
ods pursued by the detective agency.
More than Â£15,000 was paid to Slater
and Osborne for the evidence on which
the decree was originally granted.
The Solicitor General said that it was
deliberately concocted by the lowest
type of men and women, who perjured
themselves for small sums of money.
Osborne, who is a rather prominent
lawyer, startled English legal circles
by saying he would pay for evidence if
he could not get It In any other man
ner, and that he had a right to charge
as much as a client would give him,
regardless of the fixed charges which
exist among all solicitors hera
The Solicitor General bitterly de
nounced the existence of such an
agency as Slater's, which, he declared,
hounded innocent men and women with
a regularity which could scarcely be
conceived except for the present dis
closures, which were all the more
alarming as Slater was employed in the
majority of divorce and similar cases.
The arrests are expected to produce
further sensational matter relating to
other cases. The prisoners will come
up for further hearing April 30, to-day's
proceedings being merely formal.

Miss La Belle St. Leon, who is to
appear In San Francisco the laet of
this month, is one of the moBt dash
ins little bareback riders in the busi
ness. That "all la not gold that glit
ters" Is evidenced by her statement of
rehearsals while In winter quarters.
She says:
"Those who sit under the gleaming
lights around the sawdust arena of a
circus and see the silk gowned and
bespangled women equestrians as they
dash around the ring on a prancing
steed, kissing their hands to the ad
miring spectators, would be sadly dis
appointed were they to visit the train-
Ing quarters of a circus In the spring
time, before the circus takes the road,
and see the women bareback riders
practicing. Â¦.
"At Dallas, Tex., the winter quarters
of the Floto shows, may be seen yon
the vacant lots around the town the
reverse side of the gay picture. Silk
and fluffy skirts and lingeries are con-
Bplcucms only by their absence. The
women riders are clad In calico dresses
that hang limply about them and their
hair is generally wadded up in a tight
little ball on the top of their heads.
If the day is bright they wear sun
bonnets, and the appearance of a young
lady in an old calico dress reaching
only to her knees and a big sunbonnet
on her head, and standing on the back
of the horse as It trots in a circle about
an open field, is startling, if it is not
exactly picturesque."
Miss St. Leon will appear with the
; Floto shows In San Francisco April 30.

IS THE TITLE OF THE
...ART SUPPLEMENT...
By Charles Van den Eycken
TO BE GIVEN WITH THE
NEXT SUNDAY CALL
The proverbial playfulness of kittens is a favorite subject with painters who,;;/:
choose their models from the domesticated branch of the feline tribe. The fact that
the little animals have not been endowed with discretion in their choice of playthings,
along with their Instinct for play often leads them to do much mischief, and it is
tills mischief which furnishes an inexhaustible fund of material upon which such art-
Lsts as Eugene Lambert, Mme. nenriette Kbriner and Charles Van den Eycken, the
painter of the 'original of this art supplement, have drawn in producing the pictures
which are their life work.
Other artists of more serious temperament have used cats as models for repre-
sentaUons of the savage members of the same family. The anatomy of the domestic
cat is almost identical with that of many of its wild cousins, and the fact that the sav-
a^e* instincts of its ancestors have only a thin veneer of the domestication makes it
a^suiiple matter for an artist to transform the household tabby into a tiger or llon-
' ess, as Delacroix frequently did. One needs only to observe a cat drinking, eathig
or stalking a mouse or sparrow to note the resemblance recalled by VVhlttier, who
displayed 'much of a painter's mstinct In his descripUon hi the lines hi "Snow Bound"
"frfte cat's dark silhouette on the: wall, a couchant tiger's seemed to fall/*
In such pictures as the one which is the subject of this notice there are the ele-
' v menta of lively action and a pleasing suggestion of innocence and joyousnesa which
make them justly popular. In Van den Eycken's painting there is also brieht and
agreeable color and: skillful brush work.
Charles Van den Eycken is a Belgian of pure Flemish descent. He la stflJ a -
young. man and, has every prospect of becoming even more famous in his chosen
branch of -art than the celebrated Mme. Ronncr, whose pupil he is. His studio ia In
Antwerp in the same building as that of his former instructor. Dnrtog the last dec-
ade his s works have become well known hi America and the sale of his pictures hi this

"We would like to obtain your per
mission to disregard this feature of the
census law, viz., to omit that portion
relating to the obtaining of signatures
of parents or guardians."
"The census marshals." said School
Director Roncovieri. "are experiencing
great difficulty in inducing parents to
give their signatures in swearing to the
number of their children. This greatly
hampers the work and may result in
this city receiving less money from the,
State than heretofore. For each child
of school age the State pays $9 and I
am sure when this is known parents
will cheerfully sign their names.
"Some fear that it is a submission to
taxation, but It is nothing of the sort.
Last year we had more than 90,000
names and this year should exceed that
number and will If parents win comply
with the law and aid the census mar

work last year was $8000 and this year
it will exceed $12,000, owing to the new

the enforcement of this obnoxious fea

the census within the prescribed time.
BOARD MAKES APPEAIi.
It is understood that Monterey is
anxious to secure the 1S05 session of the
Grand Parlor for j that town, and it is
prepared to make a fight for the honor.
Marysville \ Is regarded as likely to be
in the fight against Monterey. As to
the new legislation that may be pro
jected at the session now at hand lit
tle is known here, but Â¦ there *? are a
number of committees that. have been
considering important subjects that
will report. They are:. v On develop

California, Morris Brooke, chairman;
on historic landmarks, J. R. Know

chairman; ;on Dormer monument, ].C.
W. Chapman, chairman; 'on navy yard
memorial, , S/'J.J McKnight, chairman.'
The latter contemplates the placing of
a '; memorial " window] ' in "> St. Peter's
Chapel at; Mare Island perpetuative of
the memories of Rear/Admiral* John D..
Sloat, Â¦ , Commodore Â¦ Robert\F. Stockton
and Admiral David G.. Farragut, three
naval heroes who were 5 identified with
the expeditions sent out by the United
States - Government to take , possession
of the territory bordering the. Pacific
Coast, affirming American authority
and establishing the Mare 'Island navy
yard. : The ; various . parlors .of 'Califor

the seven grand trusteeships, seven
teen candidates having already an
nounced themselves and engaged In
more or le'ss preliminary canvassing. It
is likely that at the coming session of
the Grand Parlor the number of grand
trustees will be increased from seven
to eleven.
The Board of Education fears that
the census of school children this year
will fall far short of last year because
the work is being delayed owing to a
provision of the new law requiring cen
sus marshals to secure the signatures
of parents or guardians of children of
eligible school age.
This new requirement has resulted in
the taking of less than 4000 names
dally, whereas last year 6500 were ob

this year'we are able but to turn in

The board yesterday transmitted a
letter to State Superintendent of
Schools Kirk, acquainting him with the
facts in the case, and appealing to that
official for permission to disregard the
provision named. The communication
follows:
"We are informed that other counties
in the State are not complying with a
strict Interpretation in relation to the
laws governing the taking of this
year's school census, inasmuch as the
census marshals are not obtaining the
signatures of the parents or guardians
of children within the school age as
prescribed by law and in conformity
with the directions Issued by your of

Denes Commission Appointed.
At the request of the attorneys of
George Benes, charged with the mur
der of his wife at the Humboldt House
on Ftockton street last December,
Judge Dunne yesterday issued a com
mission to take the evidence of per
sons in Berne. Switzerland, as to the
existence of insanity in the Benes
family. The interrogatories will be
prepared as speedily as possible. The
trial will be postponed till the receipt
of the commission's report.

The meetings conducted by Com
mander Booth-TuclTer are said to have
been the largest and most enthusiastic
ever held by the army upon the coast.
The needs of the Golden Gate
Orphanage across the bay were thor
oughly gone into. Its accommodations
have been overtaxed and many appli
cations have had to be rejected. â¢ It
was decided to extend and enlarge it
so that the work among waifs and
strays might no longer be handicapped
through lack of room. It was also de
cided to increase the summer relief
plans and arrange for fresh air outings
for 1000 mothers and children from
San Francisco.
Decisions were given affecting prop
erties to the total value of nearly
$200,000, the acquiring of which will
be beneficial to the further advance
ment of the organization. These prop
erties are situated at San Diego, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Vancauver,
Wash.; Seattle, Boise City and Ogden.
At the last mentioned place the City
Council has donated a $15,000 lot,
upon which an industrial home is to

Colonel French, provincial officer of

from Salt Lake City after finishing a
tour of Inspection, accompanying Com

t'ily Attorney Long Holds Ordinance
Conferrinj: Judicial Powers on
Body Is Unconstitutional.
City Attorney Long advised the
Board of Public Works yesterday that
it cannot be required to make the
Hssessment of damages claimed to
have been caused to the property of
:he Xau heirs by certain blasting oper
ations conducted for and on behalf of
ihe Merchants' Ice and Cold Storage
Company.
Long says thÂ«Â» action of the board
in so doing would be an oxercise of
judicial power beyond the jurisdiction
of an executive officer to perform and
that so much of an existing ordinance
hs assumes to confer such power on
such officers is unconstitutional and
void.

HAS A SAY
The School Principal Talks Aboat
. Food.
* The principal of a high school In a
flourishing California city rays:
'-'For 23 years I worked in the school
with only short summer vacations. I
formed the habit of eating rapidly,
masti^atod poorly, which, coupled with
my eedentary work, ied to indigestion,
liver trouble. ,1ame back and rheuma-
tism.
"Upon consulting physicians, some
doped me with drug3, while others pre-
scribed dieting, and sometimes I got
temporary relief, other times not. For
12 years I struggled along with this
handicap to my work, seldom laid up,
but often a burden to myself with
lameness and rheumatic pains.
"Two years ago I met an old friend,
a physician, who noticed at once my
out of health condition "and who pre-
ecribed for me an exclusive diet of
drape-Nuts, milk and fruit.
"I followed his instructions, and in
two months I felt like a new man, with
no more headaches, rheumatism or liv-
er tremble, and from that time to this
Grape-N'uts has been my main food for
morning and evening meals. Am
stronger and healthier than I have been
for years, without a trace of the old
troubles.
"Judging from my present vigorous
physical and mental state, I tell my
people Methuselah may yet have to
take sectrnd place among: the old men,
for I feel like I will live a great many
more years.
"To all this remarkable change in
health I am indebted to my wise friend
and Grape-Nuts, and I hope the Pos-
tum Company will continue to manu-
facture this life and health giving food
fpr several centuries yet. until I move
to a world where indigestion is un-
known." Name given by Postum Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich.
Ask any physician what he knows
about Grape-Nuts. Those who have |
tried It know things.
"There's a reason."

The electric cars run through the center of the property on San '

There is a constant and increasing demand for residence prop- \
erty all down the peninsula as far as San Jose. When the Southern '
PaciSc have finished their cut-off (now building) San Mateo will be !
but 14 miles from San Francisco, and the rapidly increasing popula- "

shalt not put a stumbling block before

causeth the blind to wander out of

blind men followed him, crying: 'Thou

do not dare buy the blind man's
brooms, and now the same cold-heart
ed policy ie closing our wholesale trade
against us. Nearly all of us were labor
ing people when. blindness fell upon us.
and many of us were labor union men.
We cannot now belong to a union; We
are a community by ourselves, joined
in hpnds of a. common misfortune.
"We no not ask charity, but only
work and a market for the product of
our skill. The purpose of a labor
union is declared to.be humane. If
this be so, our misfortune should
make us first among the objects of
that humanity. But instead of this
we are treated by our brothers who
see as if our blindness had outlawed
us from human sympathy and set us
among the beasts that perish.
The following has been issued by in
mates of the State Industrial Home for
the Adult Blind, located in Oakland:
""To the people of Californiaâ We are
the inmates and artisans of trie Home
for the Adult Blind in Oakland. Most
of us became blind in adult age and
found our means of making a living de
stroyed when our sight perished. Com
pelled by indigence or idleness we
sought admission to the Home as the
only place where the blind could learn
a handicraft and earn their clothing
and comforts. Those who see can form
no conception of the blessings of work
to the blind. Without it we who live in
darkness have nothing to divert us
from the sadness and sorrows of our,
situation. With work we have happi
ness. Without work we have sadness
and misery for our companion.
"In this institution about seventy of
us, work as mechanics. Our blindness
reduces our productive capacity about
one-half, so that our efficiency is about
that of thirty-five people who can see.
Our principal manufacture is brooms,
and we take honest pride in declaring
that our brooms, in stock and work
manship, are equal to any on the mar
ket. By their sale we get our sole in
come, and working at our trade is our
greatest happiness. But this opportu
nity is being taken from us by a gen
eral boycott levied against us mistak
enly by thÂ« labor unions.

California as a last resort. Surely it
cannot be true that the broom product
of pur small number, only " equaling
that of thirty-five effective workmen
and being only a small fraction of 1
per cent of the brooms consumed in
California, is in the way of any me
chanics who have all their faculties?
Yet, though It be so small a part of
the general supply, it. is everything
to us; it is manhood and'womanhood,
health and happiness. Therefore we
appeal to the people, ask your retail
dealers for the blind man's brooms,
with the label of the home ujjon them,
and take no other until the market is

E. B. Warren is the defendant in the
divorce proceedings in which Rose
Warren is the plaintiff. They were
married at Decatur, Ga.. in February.
1902, the alleged desertion occurring the
following . June. Desertion is also
charged in the complaint filed by Mar
vin Belden against Beatrice Belden,
and in the suit of Kate Schaumoeffel
against Henry Schaumoeffel neglect is
charged.
Now, according to the affidavit of
yesterday, Mrs. Cleve is sorry that she
was so lenient. She says that when
the citation was served her spouse
came to her and pretended that he
j wished to let bygones be bygones and
I return to the wife of his bosom. She
'. believed him to be sincere, she says,
' and gave ud her idea of having him
'Â¦ punished for contempt. She has since
; learned that Cleve was not sincere in
; his declaration of peace.
August, 1900, was an unlucky month
for Carrie P. Thresher and John A.
Cullen. It was their wedding month,
and each of them mismated. They had
their respective ties severed yesterday
in Judge Kerrigan's court, Mrs. Thresh
er petting a divorce from Ashley W.
Thresher, a commercial traveler, on the
grround of neglect, and Cullen getting a
decree from Maud Cullen for desertion.
Daniel A. Trudgeon, a barber, in an
answer to the suit for divorce of Dora
Trudgeon denies that he abandoned
her as she charges. He says that when
he left her a year, ago at Sutter Creek,
Amador County, it was with her con
sent and with the understanding that
soon as a sufficient length of time had
elapsed divorce proceedings were to be
instituted. He denies also that he
makes JSO a month. â¢ His income, he
says, is but $6 a week.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by J. Greenshan against Fannie Green
shan for desertion, and Joseph F.
Thompson, an engineer, against Alice
Julia Thompson for cruelty and intem
perance. Thompson says that for the
last three years his wife has been ad
dicted to the excessive use of intoxi
cants. He says that Mrs. Thompson !
would not prepare his meals for him,
end that when in her cups she would
curse and abuse him.
Etta Chappell, whose husband, Clem
Chappell, is a tally clerk in the employ
of the Scott & Van Arsdale Lumber
Company, sued him for divorce yester
day on the ground of desertion. She
says he willfully abandoned her more
than'a year ago. leaving her and their
one child to depend upon the charity of
relatives and friends for a living.
Anna C. Cunningham is seeking a di
vorce on the ground of neglect from
James A. Cunningham, to whom she
was married in May, 1902. She says he
has not provided for her for some time,
though earning a salary of $150 a
month. Besides a decree Mrs. Cunning
ham wants permission to resume her
maiden name. Eklund.
Harriet McGill wants a divorce from
Charles E. McGill on three grounds â
neglect, cruelty and infidelity. They
were married at San Jose in January,
1302. Mrs. McGill's maiden name was
Arrasmith. and she wants permission
to resume It.
In an affidavit filed yesterday by Sa
die I. Cleve, wife of Leonard Cleve, a
patternmaker, she tells the court that
she is the victim of her husband's
plausibility and asks that the contempt
proceedings instituted a week ago and
which she caused to be discontinued be
resumed forthwith, and that Cleve be
punished.
It appears from the affidavit that the
Cleves did not get along: together. Mrs.
Cleve was of the opinion that she did
not set enough of her husband's earn
ings, and eo instituted a suit for main
tenance. The action was heard by
Judge Seawell, who thought that Cleve
was Just a little bit neglectful, and or
dered him to pay his wife $30 a month
for her separate support. The order
was made April 16, and within a week
Mrs. Cleve had her husband cited to
appear and show cause why he should
not be punished for contempt of court.
He did not pay her the money. The
hearing of the excuses of Cleve was set
for April 22. but they were never heard,
for Mrs. Cleve sent word to the court
through her attorneys that she wished
the matter discontinued.

BEDBUGSâ Old Subscriber, City.
Bedbugs in a house may be destroyed
by the use of benzine or gasoline. By
using a spring bottom oilcan the fluid
may be forced into cracks and. Crevices
more thoroughly than by any. other
means. As these liquids are highly In
flammable contact with any artificial
light or fire must be avoided. The room
in which either of the fluids has, been
used should be well aired and venti
lated until the gas passes away.
AFOUL HANDâ Subscriber, City. In
poker a foul hand is one of more or less
than five cards. The rule of the game
is that if "the dealer gives to himself
or either of the other players more or

ceiving such a number of cards raises
his hand before he announces the. fact,
no misdeal occurs, and he must stand
out of the game until the next hand."
A dealer who. has a foul hand has no
claim to the pool.

FROM the Bureau of Statistics of the Department

graph on "Imports of the grand divisions and

supplied by the United State's." The figures are those of
official reports of the various countries, and represent
their own statement of imports. from the United States,
and arc npt from our records of exports; The origin of
the figures is to be noted because our record of exports
to many countries does not exactly correspond to that
country's record of imports from us; the difference be-'

are frequently delivered primarily at a port. of another;

of Trieste. â¢

Few events in the history of the
Western Hemisphere deserve to be
more gratefully remembered by Amer
icans on both sides of that line
across the Isthmus of Panama which
it is to divide, yet bring nearer^ to
gether, the northern and southern con
tinents; and no event of the past sug
gests more clearly a method of rap
prochement which (if our government
can take a hint from the great trav
eler) may prove as valuable in the fu
ture as the ship canal itself. Humboldt
writes in the "Personal Narrative":
"We succeeded In conciliating {he
friendship of the natives, and that of
the Europeans- entrusted with the ad
ministration of these vast countries.
During the five years that we traveled
throughout the new continent, we did
not perceive the slightest mark of mis
trust; and we remember with pleasure^
that, amid the most painful privations,
and while we were struggling against
the obstacles which arose from the sav
age state of those regions, we never
had to complain of the injustice of
men." This splendid result was at
tained through simple means which are
mentioned In the following terms:
"During my abode in America, I pre
sented the governors of provinces with
a duplicate of the materials which I
had collected, and which might inter
est the mother country by throwing
some light on the geography and the
statistics of the colonies." Both the
Latin-Americans and their European
associates were permitted to realize
their, full and equal participation in
whatever gains were to be made. More
over, all were convinced that the pur
pose of the journey was not commer
cial or political; and it was found to
be true, as Humboldt has written In
another place, that "partial enmities
disappear before- the advancement of
general knowledge, which is the gen
eral cause of all nations." â Harper's
Weekly.

ON October 3 of this year the thirteenth Interna
tional Peace Congress will meet in Boston. It is
intended that in connection therewith and imme
diately following it meetings will be held in New York,
Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, St. Louis and per
haps other cities, to be addressed by leading foreign del
egates and strong local speakers.
The meeting at, Boston will be notable in being the
second gathering of the international body held in Amer
ica, the first having been' convened in Chicago in 1893.
It is fitting that Boston' has been selected, for to that
city belongs the honor of having started the first influ
ential peace society in the world, that founded by Wil
liam Ellery Channing in 1815. To that society much
of the credit is due for , the dissemination of the seed
which ultimately bore fruit in the great International
Peace Congresses held in Europe in the middle of the
last century. One of these, the London Congress of
1843, was the precursor of a memorable scries of meet
ings held a few years afterward, probably the most not
able being that at Paris under the presidency of Victor
Hugo in 1849.
While it would seem a high honor that a city in this
country should be selected, so remote in point of loca
tion from the countries to which the great majority of
the delegates belong, it is not to be forgotten that the
position of the United States on the question of inter
national arbitration is an honored one. No delegation
was more influential at the Hague Conference than our
own, and Baron d'Estournelles de Constant, who will
come to Boston as the leader of the French delegation,
a member of the Hague court and head of the arbitration
movement in France, recently declared that the action of
our Government in promptly sending to The Hague the
pious fund case, and by an insistence upon reference
thereto of the Venezuela cases, has done more to hasten
the regular use of the tribunal and to advance its pres
tige than anything else. In fact, the idea finally realized
at The Hague of a permanent international tribunal was
generally spoken of in Europe at the peace gatherings as
the "American plan," and credited to American thinkers
rather than to the Czar of Russia.
'The. object of the International Peace^Congresses is
to promote popular education regarding the duty of sup
planting the war system by rational and legal methods,
a speedy reduction of the armaments of the world and
the application of the vast sums spent upon them to con
structive ends, and the better general organization of the
nations in their mutual relations. .
All civilized powers have come gradually to recognize
the necessity for the establishment of an international
tribunal, and although governments, it is true, are slow
to, call upon such a court when the question involved is
one that intimately concerns themselves,: public opinion
seems little by little to be. favoring the idea that it should
be mandatory rather than -optional, that international
questions should be submitted to such a court, instead of
to a contest at arms.

The Deputy Marshal of Berkeley arrested a man last
Tuesday for robbery and placed him in the prehistoric
calaboose at West Berkeley. Wednesday's sun came and

And Colonel O'Neill had to tramp for
an hour about the post to get a pass
from the officer of the day. v>. .
An example of the Importance ' at
tached to shoulder straps was recently
brought to the notice of Colonel O'Neill,
First California I.-^iment, National
Guard. He was at the Presidio in civ
ilian garb the other day to seek an in
terview with Major Carrington, com
mander of . the Filipino Scouts. When
he approached the outer line of the
camp he was halted abruptly by a lit
tle Filipino sentry. Something about
the face of the brown man caught the
colonel's attention. The features seem
ed familiar and on second glance the
colonel recognized the Filipino as one
of the men employed by him while he
was doing duty with the First Califor
nia regiment in the Islands.
"Gangway, Pedro," said the colonel,
calling him by name and trying to
brush past.
The sentry blocked his way with
bayonet fixed. "Vamos," he said. "You

for certain it is that no couple has ever
been known to start to cross or leave

a fear of changing the luck by bestow

When the young men became old
enough to vote they voted a bridge*,
across the ravine. It was a picturesque'
affair and the new one will be as like
it as one pea is like another. There are
two great steel cables stretched across,
from bank to bank, and from these
cables a narrow platform is suspended.
After the first bridge was built the
young folks of both towns used it. The
bridge was the objective point for a
walk, and it is asserted that Cupid was
the brldgetender. It is stated that half
of the matches of the two towns have
been made there, and the boys boast
that they "popped the question" in mid
air.
The two places are separated by deep
ravines, and it was found necessary to
bridge one of them In order to get back
and forward.
It Is asserted that most of the popu
lation of the old town was composed of
pretty girls, while there was an army
of young men in the new town. Thia
occasioned much traveling back and
forward and the boys had to. go around
several miles or make a shortcut down
through the ravine.
The town of Columbus Junction and
Columbus City are built on .towering
hills that overlook the valleys of ths
Iowa and the Cedar rivers, these two
streams forming a junction near thÂ«
towns. Columbus City is the older
town and located back of the hills.
When the Rock Island railway built
its lines there were too many hills to
get anywhere near, the town, so a new
town was started at the Junction and
called Junction City.
A "lovers' leap" Is considered a good
thing in Columbus Junction,' Iowa,
where sweethearts wore the old -affair
out and a new one Is now being built
to take its place.

"I he School Girl" has the longest run
10 its credit of .the pieces now being
jttrformed in the West End. having
been played for 300 times or more. The
book of this piece was written orig
inally by Paul Potter, but it was whip
ped Into shape by Henry Hamilton,
the score being supplied by Leslie
Stuart, author of "Florodora." The
music of "The School Girl" is not as
generally catchy as that of the play
about the perfume, but one of the
sung?. "My Little Canoe," is a great
hit. This is sung by Billie Burke, who
is an American girl. Pauline Chase,
cf "pink pajama" fame, is also in the
cast, not to mention the star. Edna
May, who never has done anything as
Cuv.d as the little convent girl who

Whrn George Edwardes announced a
musical version of the Sans Gene story.
tinder the title of "The Duchess of
Dantzi^." a failure seemed inevitable.
In s*pite of the manager's declaration
the libretto which had been writ
ten for him by Henry Hamilton for
trade by Ivan Caryll was the best he
ever hid read. Hamilton, by the way,
Fpfms definitely tn have deserted play
in favor of musical comedy writing.
The version of the "Three Musket
eeTB** made by him was a success both
here and in the United States, where
Botherh ust-d it. but though it was re
verted some time ago that Hamilton
was writing a r>Iay for Kyrlc- Bellow,
libretti only have c^me from him. But
"The Duchess of Dantzic" at the Lyric
is one of the greatest successes Ed
v ardÂ«s has had. In it Holbrook Blinn,
the American singer, has the part of
N'jpoKon. "The Orchid," which open
< (1 the new Gaiety, has been played 100
'. inics. and probably will be played a
frw hundred more, having caught the
town. It is by the authors of the
"Toreador" and Quite as picturesque
j'.mi tuneful, with another "Sammy
<;;?g" part for Edmund Payne, the
ijai^iy funmaker, most of whose char
acters have ueen played in America by
A1-..3 mirthsome "Jimmy" Powers. When
. "The Cingalee," which followed "A
Â«:oimtry Girl" at Daly's, and which was
to be called 'Beautiful Ceylon," has
had a few catchy songs dropped into it.
it will be one of the most attractive
musical comedies ever produced. The
starring is gorgeous, perhaps the most
lavish ever seen in London, and the

It is inevitable that when people are denied their
rights, or vexatiously delayed in obtaining what belongs
to them under the law, others will by corruption secure
more than their legal rights. This is what is alleged
to have happened in the cases now at bar here. As
divulged in their hearing it appears that there has been
in vogue a system of soliciting bribes. An honest man,
seeking his rights, could get them if he would pay sums
not authorized by law. If he flinched at the risk dis
honest men would take it and get thereby what they
had no right to. So we have revealed a system of solici
tation of bribes, the use of clerks as stool pigeons,
because they were well known to land dealers as bribe
takers, and a complete, and foul system of shutting off
the acquisition of the public domain by honest men
and leaving it open only to those who would pay for
greasing the progress of patents through its various
stages.
"The men now charged with such work were pro
fessional land manipulators, but others were as liable
to be caught by detective ingenuity using official solici
tation of bribes as its instrument, and perhaps many an
honest man, finding his choice limited to abandoning
his purpose to get land legally, or obtaining what was
his right by bribery, has yielded and paid the exaction
levied upon him. In the State courts criminal cases
have no standing when the cause of action against the
accused began with the soliciting of a bribe by the
ofncial used as a prosecuting witness. There are sound
reasons in equity for this. An' examination of all the
noted cases of Congressional and other ofncial corrup
tion reveals the fact that in nearly eVery case the system
began by ofncial denial to men of their rights. When
they were compelled to secure rights that belonged
to them by bribery they would go further and recoup
themselves by securing through bribery what did not
belong to them.
Something more than prosecution of the cases now
at bar is needed. The scheme of business in the Interior
Department needs a thorough reform. No administra
tion has attempted it. It has been necessary under all.
It is true that the task presents colossal difficulties. But
it is rendered all the more necessary by the expanding
functions of that department of the Government.
lions are now in its possession to build irrigation works,
and it has the power ' of withdrawal of desert lands
in anticipation of covering them with water. Costly
works arc under way. Contractors, have to be dealt
with. The people who will finally take the irrigated
lands expecting to return to the Government the cost
of putting them under water are vitally concerned in
the methods pursued and the expense incurred.
These operations of the Government suspend private
enterprise. We have already seen the effect of this on
the Colorado River. The Interior Department has filed
on all of its water, destroying a large amount of private
capital encouraged to irrigate the Colorado desert from
that river by the assent of the War Department, which
has jurisdiction of meandered streams. If the Colo
rado is meandered as navigable, the Government has
no right to file on all its water for irrigation. If it is
non-navigable, the Government has no right to file on
it at all, for the non-navigable waters are under State
and local control entirely. So, in the prosecution of
Government irrigation, the people find an added reason
why the manners of officialdom should be mended, and
its ways -be made to conform to the private rights of
honest men.
Under all administrations there has existed in the
Interior Department a system of hold-up by clerks and
subordinates,, which has deterred and delayed the honest
acquisition of patents to mineral, agricultural and other
classes of lands. This system is well understood â¢ by
every one who has , attempted to do business there.
Technical delays, time-wasting objections and frauds
perpetrated in the department in denial of private rights
are found conspicuous in the history of the department.
One instance in this State is remembered, because it
resulted in the final eviction j of honest "citizens from
their holdings legally acquired. One of the Mexican
grants was judicially examined and a proper delimiting
decree entered. When the Interior Department issued
the patent it was made' to cover lands far beyond the
decree. Some of these had long been patented to pri
vate owners by the Government; others were held under
the tide land patents of the State, and one im
portant 'property belonged to the Federal Government
itself. All were alienated by an official patent which
Congress declared to be an official fraud. Yet the
parties despoiled have never been permitted access to
judicial or other means for rectifying the wrong and
have been made victims of the underlying system by
which citizens are barred from their rights or despoiled
of their property.
THE Government land cases, on hearing here, re
veal some features that are of interest beyond
the immediate issues. With persons accused of
grabbing lands illegally, by forgery and subornation
of pcrjurj\ there can be no sympathy. If guilty they
commit a double offense: against the Government as
trustee of the public domain, and against the honest
citizen \vhose right of acquisition of part of that domain
under the law is abridged by its illegal absorption.

would-be groom. "I'll . be hanged if I

"That will do for you," said Dan
forth, "now give me the name of the
future Mrs. Johnson."
The young fellow meditated for a mo
ment. Hesitatingly he said "Lizzie."
Then he stopped, blushed, scratched his
head, looked confused, stood on one
foot and then on the other, dug his
hands into his pockets and bolted from
the room.
There was no need of putting, a tag
on the young fellow who late one after
noon last week jauntily walked
through the corridors of the City HalL

happy look in his eyes told as plainly
as could the largest placard that he
was in search of the marriage license
office. When he entered the room pre
sided over by Cupid Dariforth he lost
no time, but inarched straight up to
the desk.
"Well, young man," said . Danforth,
"what can I do for you?"
"I want a license," said ths young
fellow, with a grin.

Southern Wyoming will shortly be
come the paradise of the trout fisher
men. It abounds in splendid streams,
streams that have not yet been whip
ped, that fairly swarm with trout. The
North Platte River, where it rages and
tumbles across the line between Colo
rado and Wyoming, Is full of big fel
lows that call forth all the muscle and
skill and patience of the most skillful
angler. The Big Laramie, the Little
Laramie, and the streams that as yet
have no name â all are well stocked.
It is strange that this wonderful
trout country is not swarming with
sportsmen every season. To the south,
in Colorado, the country is full of ho
tels and cottages and cabins and
camps. In the Black Hills of South Da
kota and the Big -Horn Mountains of
Wyoming, the fishermen flock in. large
numbers, undertaking longer Journeys
and undergoing. greater fatigues than
are required to reach the fishing
grounds below Laramie City. â Field

It is difficult to estimate the influence
of fiction to-day, but there can be no
doubt that it is very great. The
amount of time spent by hundreds of
thousands of readers in the reading of
novels passes computation, and there
are very many whose whole outlook on
life is based upon fiction. It is not
probable, scarcely believable, that such
an influence can be wholesome. It
might become so, of course, were our
present day works of fiction true to life
and human nature, but as matters
stand, it is a deplorable fact that the
vast majority of readers in this coun
try devote themselves to fiction and
newspapers, neither very safe guides to
a knowledge of truth.
Publishers are often censured for not
issuing masterpieces instead of second
or third cla=s literature. I wonder how
many people outside the inner circle
realize what terrible rubbish is being
continually offered to publishing houses
in the hope apparently that it may
see the light of print. "What weary
work is that of a publisher's reader,
miles and miles of type-written and
hand-written copy to look through, and
how few grains of wheat amid the mass
of chaff! Most often a glance at a man
uscript is enough to determine its fate;
sometimes, however, many pages have
to be read before the reluctantly un
favorable opinion is formed. Then not
infrequently the reader Is vexed to see
how a 'prentice hand has frittered
away a good idea or how a fine writer
1b wasting his force in beating the air.
Only at very rare intervals is the dis
covery made of a manuscript which is
worth careful consideration, still more
rarely does there come from an un
known writer a work worth publishing.
Very unbusinesslike are the proceed
ings of many who desire to see their
books published or their articles and
stories accepted by the magazines. Take
an example. The majority of the maga
zines have a more or less decided line
of policy with regard to stories and ar
ticles, yet editors are pestered with
manuscripts utterly unsuited to their
pages. They are also worried and
wearied with articles on subjects which
have already been recently dealt with,
and, a very common occurrence, are
offered tales and essays ludicrously
late, e. g. t Christmas matter sent in
long after all the Christmas numbers
have gone to press. A little business
forethought and common sense would
save many, a disappointment to would
be contributors and worry to editors
and publishers' readers. Editors want
good, fresh, suitable copy and do not
reject proffered contributions through
carelessness or for the fun of rejecting
them.â The Academy.

after a run of four nights â one of the
worst disasters on record at the St.

etiquette from marrying; the humble
girl he loved, and by pride from leav

stuffed with explanations of the, ob

play failed because the public doesn't
care for such serious, thoughtful mat

but perhaps the fact Is that It failed
because, as translated and transplant

dialogue, and loose in construction. It
has been succeeded by a revival of "Old

THE GOVERNMENT LAND CASES.
Turning from grand divisions of the globe to the chief
commercial nations, the statistics arc to the effect that
the United Kingdom took 24.03 per cent of her imports
from the United States; Germany, 15.86 per cent;
France, 9.67 per cent; Netherlands, 10.79 per cent;
Belgium, 11.59 per cent; Spain, 12.62 per cent;
China, 9.26 per cent; Japan, 17.9 per cent; Common
wealth of Australia, 11.92 per cent; New Zealand, 11.65
per cent; Philippine Islands, 12.46 per cent; Cape of
Good Hope, 9.52 per cent; Argentina, 12.91 per cent;
Colombia, 26.37 per cent; Venezuela, 31.97 per cent;
â¢British Guiana, 31.35 per cent; Mexico, 58.91 per cent;
Canada, 57.29 per cent; Cuba, 43.71 per cent; British West
Indies, 33.97 per cent, and the Central American States,
as a whole, 43.32 per cent.
As was to be expected our largest percentage of trade
is with countries nearest to us, such as Canada and Mex
ico; and next with countries with which we , have the
most ample and frequent steamship connections, such as
Great Britain and Germany. Good as is the showing
made in the monograph, it would have been much better
had Congress long ago given to American shipping on
the deep seas anything like the aid given to American
industries on* land. When once we have an ocean mer
chant marine adequate to our needs, it is a foregone con
clusion that our exports to all the markets of the world
will be largely increased. Â»
$215,866,000, or 52.55 per cent South America imported
$349",69 1,000, of which : $43,878,000, or 12.55 per cent, was
from the United States. Asia's imports were $965,550,
600, of which $50,167,000, or 5.2 per cent, was from the
United . States. Africa's imports were $436,256,000, of
which $24,333,000, or 5.58 per cent, was from the United
States. The imports of . Oceania were $292,107,000, of
which $34,855,000, or 11^93 per cent, was drawn from the
United States. This figure for Oceania does not include
the Hawaiian Islands, which are considered as a part of

'ttlVES A POWER OP
ATTORNEY TO SISTER
Â¦WAT3OXVIL.L.E. April 23.â The new
steamship line between Watsonville
and San Francisco was formally In
augurated to-day. An immense crowd
of people gathered on the Watsonville
Transportation Company's new wharf
at Port Rogers to welcome the arrival
of the company's new steamer, named
in honor of one of Watsonvllle's fore-:
most citizens, F. A. Kilburn.
The new steamship line and its rail
road connection from Port Rogers, on
Monterey Bay, to "Watsonvllle, in Pa
jaro Valley, is owned by a Watsonville
stock company. One year ago the
project of an independent rail and
steamer line between this city and San
Francisco was begun by W. J. Rogers
of Russell & Rogers, lumber dealers
and ship owners of San Francisco and
San Jose. The enterprise found such
ready interest in Watsonville that the
ttock was soon marketed and the con
struction of the wharf was put under
way. The new structure is located
about a mile north of the former site
of the old Pajaro landing, long since
washed away, but still marked by a
few buildings representing Camp
Goodall. Experts have pronounced the
new wharf one of the best on the
â¢where the new company will compete
with the Southern Pacilic for the im
mense shipments of berries sent
out from that most productive
section of ' the Pajaro Valley.
From here the line will be ex
tended to Hollister at an early
date. Guarantees of patronage along
the entire route have oeen secured, and
much interest in the project is mani
fested in San Benito County.
The K A. Kilburn was built by the
H. B. Bendixsen Shipbuilding Com
pany at Eureka, Cal. Completely
equipped, she cost $123,000. Her engines
are of the four-cylinder triple-expan
sion dynamic balance type, and are of
1200 horsepower. Her length over all is
175 feet', with 30-foot beam. The upper
deck is for passengers only, and the
lo\VÂ£r deck and hold for, freight. Her
fuel' oil capacity is sufficient for eight
round trips from Port Rogers to San
Francisco. There are forty-five state
rooms, all on the outer side of the up
per deck. There are electric bells in.
all the staterooms and in the officers'
quarter?. Electric lights are every
where, and, with sidelights, headlights
and searchlight, furnish all the. light
needed. The dining cabin is a model of
neatness, and under a. competent chef
provides the best of fare.

clothes valued at $40 and a watch. and

sold the clothing for $2 75 and had the
watch and razor In his possession when
he was arrested. The" charge Is grand
larceny and Judge Cabaniss will hear it.
Jessie Vassar, a shapely brunette,
was fined $5 for vagrancy by Judge
Mogan, despite her plea that she was
merely seeking an apartment in which
to establish a dressmaking shop when
a. vigilant policeman found her prowl
ing the'eorridors of a Market street
lodging-house of shady repute.
"If you were not young and inex
perienced in the ways of the under
world you would never . spring the
chestnutesque dressmaking plea," said
his Honor to Jessie, "and for your own
sake I hope you will celebrate your re
lease from this scrape by returning to
the straight and narrow path that is
trod by true womanhood."
Jessie paid her fine and assured the
court that she "will at. once go back to
her parents In the country and live
with them as long as they are willing
to keep her. ? .", ,.
"That's the talk," said the Judge,
"and may good luck go with you. 1 '

Chauffeur Newcomb says that the
maximum- speed of his automobile was

ed for fast driving within the city

Patrolman Edner was pacing his
weary round and passing a sailors'
boarding-house at Front and Jackson
streets when abruptly, emerged from
the doorway thereof the bulky form of
Louis Hansen, able seaman, and an in
stant later a heavy earthen cuspidore
followed him and shattered to bits at
the officer's feet. Mr. Hansen was hat
less and both ' his eyes were dark
rimmed and swollen.
"The Iversons did it," he explained to
the policeman, and then he accompa
nied the latter, to an apartment on the
second story v of the ; hostelry, . wherein
were discovered Harry Iverson, a. b.,
and his wife Teresa, locked in close
embrace and punching, scratching and
biting each other most vigorously.
When the officer' split.-, them \. out ; he
found that the man had lost consider-,
able hair and the woman's' eyes, were in
the same condition as Mr. Hansen's. So
he arrested the trio for fighting. ;; ; V '
None of the defendants could explain
to Judge Mogan Just what' startedlthe
fracas, but all were very, sorry that it
â¢ â¢ *
"Good enough." quoth the court. "I'll
give you till Monday to produce the
chiropodist."
"Do you know the man who did com
mit that offense?" the Judge inquired.
"I do," replied the defendant; "he's a
corn doctor and I can bring him here
to testify that I'm innocent." .
Accused of disorderly conduct, Louis
de Marlnl told Judge Cabaniss that a
mistake had been made in the matter
of his arrest, as he was not the person
who had hauled down and destroyed
the banner borne by a "picket" in front
of a Mason-street restaurant that was
under boycott by the Cooks' and Walt
ers' Union, vy. .
Charles A. Carroll, charged with con
ducting a lottery place at 417 Fourth
street, was arraigned before Judge
Conlan and demanded and was granted
a Jury trial. He was (arrested by Pa
trolmen Egan and O'Connell, who stat
ed he informed them that he was Im
mune from police interference because
he was representing a large and well
known lottery agency.
"If you had told the truth you would
have fared better," remarked his
Honor, by way of preface to handing
Charles the maximum penalty.
"WTiat do you say to that?", asked
the Judge, and Charles hung his head
and confessed that he had prevari
cated.
Charles Hall, vagrant, lied to Judge
Fritz and was given six months' im
prisonment for it. Charles declared
that he was employed as harness man
in the stable of a wholesale grocery
firm, and that his character could be
vouched for by the foreman of the es
tabHshment, George Keenan. The bail
iff was instructed to telephone to the
stable, which he did, and received the
information that no such person as
George Keenan was known there, nor
had Charles Hall ever been on the pay
roll.
Two men are In the hospital with
probably fatal injuries' as the "result of
a shooting which occurred Saturday
night, April 16, in the Hughes House
on Sixth street, between Mission and
Howard. One of them, George Pear
son, ; a teamster, shot the other,
Charles Ford, Â«. glassblower, In the
mouth and then in an effort to avoid
arrest jumped from a third-story win
dow to a stone sidewalk forty-five feet
below, sustaining damages which may
result in death. He is charged with
assault to murder, and, If he survives,
the case will be heard May 3 by Judge
Mogan, who yesterday learned that
there was a worthless woman at the
bottom of the tragedy.
Her name is Clara Evans, and Pear
son and Ford were rivals for her fickle
affection. Pearson was visiting her
apartment in the Hughes House when
Ford, accompanied by a seafaring
friend, rapped xm the door. Pearson
responded and when he saw his rival
he drew a pistol and dared him to en
ter. Ford accepted the challenge and
Pearson fired. The bullet entered
Fold's mouth and is still buried some
where in his head, the Heceiving Hos
pital surgeons considering Its removal
too risky to attempt. The wounded
man fell, the sailor ran away, the
woman screamed and swooned and
Pearson sought to escape via- the stair
way until he saw that route blocked by
the burly form of Patrolman McEntee.
Then he re-entered the woman's
chamber and leaped through the win
dow. His legs are broken and he is
injured internally.
Since the occurrence the woman has
been in a state of nervous prostration,
and the sailorman, who was the only
other witness of the shooting, has suc
ceeded in bafSng pursuit.
It now remains to be seen whether
Judge Cabaniss will consider the tes
timony sufficient to justify him in up
holding the decision of Judge Conlan.
or whether- he will agree with Bying
ton that the evidence is strong enough
to warrant his holding the defendant
for murder.
Fossa killed Vincenza Lavagnino by
throwing him downstairs in a house
on Chestnut street one night several
months ago ;ind after hearing the evi
dence Judge Cabaniss held him for
manslaughter. The District Attorney,
however, considered the testimony suf
ficient to hold the defendant on the
capital charge' and accordingly filed in
formation against him for murder. It
was then discovered that the Supreme
Court had just decided that when a
person has been held by a committing
magistrate to answer a certain charge
It Is the duty of the District Attorney
.to act in accordance with that charge
and not to' undertake judicial func
tions In any way. This dt-cision re
stored Fossa to the position in which
Judge Conlan had placed him â a de
fendant held to answer for man
slaughter â but the District 'Attorney
did not let it go at that, for yesterday
he again filed information for murder
against Fossa and had the hearing
assigned to Judge Cabaniss.
An interesting point of law Is In
volved In the case of Giovanni Fossa,
who Is to be arraigned before Judge
Cabaniss to-morrow on a charge of
murder filed by District Attorney By
ington.
While the wind was cutting mis
chievous capers on Market street Fri
day afternoon one of its spasmodic
gusts lifted Philip Bruce's hat from his
head and skimmed it along the side
walk paralleling the Palace Hotel.
Philip pursued, the fugitive headgear,
and so deeply intent was he upon its
recovery that he saw nothing else. That
was how his bowed head butted into
the abdomen of Joseph Garcia as that
gentleman posed in front of a candy
store and held aloft a large signboard
which informed all whom it might con
cern that the finest and cheapest con
fections on earth could be purchased
inside. Joseph resented the rude intro
duction by bringing his placard down
with violence upon Philip's uncovered
cranium, and then they mixed and
were arrested. In one of Joseph's pock
ets the policeman foynd a large pistol
of antique pattern. Philip's hat was
captured and restored to its owner by
a sympathetic spectator.
"Dees man one tief," said Joseph
Garcia to Judge Mogan. "He holda me
up an' trya to taka ma mon'."
'.'.Tut, tut. Joseph, your plea is silly,"
said his Honor. "Even an idiotic foot-

dismissal on the ground that he. had
been non-aggressive and that the
sturdy lumber schooner Fair Wind was
ready to sail and could not leave port
without him, and his prayer bore the
desired fruit. A- similar plea was
sprung "by Mr. Iverson, whose, craft, the
Tidal Wave, was awaiting his steady
hand and experienced eye to steer her
through the Gate, but he was fined $5
for blackening the optics of his help

At the park in the ope^i air pavilion
was given "another band 'concert and
addresses by Benjamin Ide - Wheeler,
General' N. P. Chip'man and Washing
ton Dodge, all the addresses on the
lines of thought suggested by the com
pletion - of the greatest Irrigation sys
tem in this great- State.' '
Mayor Williams of Stockton followed
Colonel Irish in' a short congratulatory
address. After the conclusion of the
address of Judge Waymire, the band
continued the concert, at the conclu
sion of which the people witnessed a
magnificent display of day fireworks.
During this time another hugh crowd
had repaired to the race course to see
the athletic meet of teams of the San
Joaquin Valley Academic League, In
which the high school athletic teams
of Fresno, Sanger, Madera, Merced,
Eastin, Oakdale and Modesto partici
pated. The teams hold an annual
meet. Modesto has been the cup holder
for the last year and in the event to
day the Modesto bovs won out again,
saving the championship by a safe
margin. Munn of Modesto was the
star of the event. Musler of Fresno
was the best point winner.
In the middle of the afternoon it was
estimated that over 10,000 people were
on the streets of Modesto, of whom it is
said 2500 were from outside of the coun
ty. At night there was a street illum
ination, two dances at the big hafts
and the high school teams with their
school yells, the streets packed with
people throwing confetti and indulging
in good-natured banter, all combining
to form a scene long to be remembered
by the people of Stanislaus at least.'
and Turlock districts were organized.
In effect Mr. Irish stated that these
districts, the greatest in the United
States, would stand as a perpetual
monument to the memory of the man
who was the originator of the legisla
tion. The speaker also dwelt on the
possibilities of the county, also those
of the State, and. impressed upon his
hearers the fact of their priceless herit
age.

MODESTO. April 23. â The climax of
â¢ the Modesto-Turlock irrigation jubilee
c.-lebration came to-day, and the num
ber of people on the streets was
over 10,000. In the morning three ex
cursion trains were run on the
ern Pacific Railway, covering Xhe dis
tricts as much as r>osssible from the
north to the south. Three trains were
run of ten coaches each, and the peo
ple who wished to see the mains and
laterals filled the seats and aisles of
.the coaches. Stoi>s were made at inter
esting points on the route, and men
who are familiar with the story of
irrigation in this county accompanied
the tourists, explaining and pointing
out the points of salient interest.
Every carriage in the town and
v score's of vehicles belonging to ranch- ;
*<rs who were in from the rural dis
tricts were pressed into service, giving
Fightseers free trijis through the terri
tory surrounding Modesto, taking in
several lateral canals and orchards and
alfalfa fields. The train excursions
crossed twenty laterals on the trip, j
"which covered a strip of territory about
ten miles each way from Modesto.
A military street parade by Compa
nies A, B, H and D, Sixth Regiment,
X. CL C which are camped here for
the Jubilee, took place in the morning,
also a popular concert by the Third Ar
tillery band from the Presidio.
In the afternoon there was a review
cf the National Guard battalion' by
Governor Pardee, Adjutant General
Lnncli and staff, and a reception at the
courthouse park.
PRAISE FOR THE WORK.
The reception meeting was called to
order by Attorney W. H. Hatton, after
which there were speeches by Colonel
.T. P. Irish. C. C. Wright and Judge J.
A. Waymire of Alameda, who is termed
kh^ "Father of Turlock Irrigation Dis
trict." Judge Wivmlre's' speech was,
in part, as follows:
â¢'I congratulate the people of the Mo
desto and TurJoek irrigation districts
upon the success of their great enter
prise pud rejoic*? with them. It is my
sincere wish, as it Is my firm belief,
;!iat (his in the beginning of a prosper
ity and progress that will surpass any
thing hortofore known In this State.
You have completed a system of Irriga
tion "vvorkfc superior to any other in the

many miles of small laterals), distrib
uting; the water over 260,000 acres of ex
cellent land, with scarcely an acre ,of
waste.
"Upon this land there Is now a popu
lation of 7000 intelligent industrious
Americans, all prosperous and happy.
N'ew homes are springing up daily.
The climate is an Ideal one â neither
too hot in summer nor too cold in win
ter. The soil will produca anything
frum wheat to oranges. The water is
abundant and the title to it is un
questioned. Best of all, the title is in
the districts. The owners of the land
are also the owners of the water; you
pay tribute to no one. You get th^
water as a right and not as a favor;
thus as far as it is possible on the
face of this earth, you have eliminated
all the speculative and disagreeable
features from the business of farming.
Tou are within a little more than one
hundred miles of the largest market
of the Pacific Coast, looking out upon
the Orient, where half the population
of the world, struggling for existence
upon an overtaxed soil, is waiting for
the fruits of your Industry. You are
connected with that vast population
by two lines of railroads to. San Fran
cisco and by the Pacific Ocean to the
shores of Asia and the islands of the
sea."
CROWDS OX TRAINS.
When the excursion trains,, thirty
cars in all, returned to this city the ex
pressions of admiration of the country
embraced in the districts were gratify
ing. The excursions, more -than any
other feature of the jubilee, gave evi
dence of the prosperity of the county
under the beneficent iniiuence of water.
From tho car windows could.be seen
broad fields of luxuriant alfalfa, sleek
dairy herds, orchards ! and vineyards,
while here and there could be seen a
vast grain field, showing what the
county had "been before the advent of
water.
' Immediately after noon was the re
view of the National Guard battalion
by the Governor and then, the multi
tude wended its way. to the park,
where there was a concert by the fa
mous Presidio band and speechmaking
by notables. Colonel John P. Irish /of
San Francisco 'was the first speaker;
and, in glowing terms, he eulogized

deprives Harriman of absolute mastery

Long made an excellent .showing
against Allen, and the latter had to-use
all his skill to pull out the third and
deciding set. Long beat Allen a love

a score of 6â1. In their third set Long
was constantly In the lead, and at 4 â 3
and 40â0 had an excellent chance to
win. Long also led at 5 â 4, but Allen
finished strongly and won out, 7â3.
A fast doubles was played between
Dr. Sumner Hardy and Dr. H. P. Hill
and Frank Mitchell and Will Allen.
Despite a lack of practice Hardy easily
outclassed the re^t, and with the as
sistance he received from Hill won five
straight sets from Allen and Mitchell.
Hardy is a trifle off on his strokes, but
still plays a heady game. The first four
sets were all won by Hardy and Hill
quite easily. In the fifth set Allen and
Mitchell played better tennis arid made
their opponents extend themselves to
win.
Herbert Long proved much too strong
for Lloyd Baldwin in a singles match.
Long Avon three sets easily.
Melville Long and Dr. Noble took R.
B. Daggett and Dr. Lovegrove into
camp, winning four sets out of five.
Lovegrove and Daggett won the first
set easily, but their opponents annexed
the next four, the last tv. f o being close.
Young Long was easily the star of the
four, but was ably assisted by his part
ner. The scores follow:
Herbert Long beat Lloyd Baldwin,
6â1. 6â2, 6â4: Will Allen beat H. Long.

The yachting season of 1904 was
opened most auspiciously at the head
quarters of the San Francisco Yacht
Club yesterday at New Sausalito.
At anchor off the club wharf lay
nearly the whole fleet, including Com
modore W. G. Morrow's sloop Chal
lenger, J. V. Coleman's big schooner
Aggie, the sloops Surprise, Alice. The
tis, Annie, Ariel, Nellie, Curlew and
Mlnnetonka (formerly Angela), the
yawls Tramontana. Royal, Phyllis and
Witch, and the power-boats Vladimir;
Kittle M and Edwinna. The big sloop
Sappho is not yet in commission, but
nearly all the other pleasure craft were
decorated with all the signal and prize
flags to be found In their lockers.
The clubhouse piazzas, wharf ami
float presented a lively and animated
appearance. United States officers In
uniform, jolly tars in gala attire and
ladies in summer toilettes contributing
to the gayety of the scene. Big bowls
of cooling liquids were at hand to as
suage the .inevitable thirst of hosts and
guests. Between 5 and 6 p. m. the la
dies left the clubhouse, having 'spent
an afternoon that was rendered highly
agreeable by the hospitality of the
amateur mariners. Toward 8 o'clock
the yachtsmen reassembled, and at 8:30
the jinks began in the big hall. The
De Koven Club of Berkeley, under the
direction of Clinton R. Morse, assisted
by Rollin C. AyVes and W. X Hynes,
provided the chief items of the pro
gramme. Frank Glllelan rendered a
banjo solo and Mr. Williams a violin
solo.
Milton Schwartz entertained the 4
yachtsmen with a monologue,' and Fel
lows and Walker gave an amusing
sketch. Senora Matildita. accompanied
by Maurice Kramer, the well-known
pianist, gave some Spanish dances, and
Blondina furnished an exhibition of the
Terpsichorean art in the French style.
At 11. o. m. supper was served, after
which the fun was resumed.
This morning the yacht owners . will
go on board the flagship Challenger to
receive the Instructions of Commodore
W. G. Morrow. At 10 o'clock, on signal
from the flagship, the fleet will cruise
over to the city front *and out toward
the heads. In the afternoon the fleet
will return to its. moorings at Sausa*
llto and the yacttlng season of 1904 will
be officially open.

DOLES GREAT VAULT.
With a world's record of 11 feet 8*i
Inches, Dole soared over the bar at the
twelve-foot mark. Not satisfied with
the accomplishment, he tried to make
the affair a -true California victory"
by ordering the crossbar placed at 12
feet 6 Inches. Try as he would, he
could not get over the notch leaving
the bar untouched, and had to be sat
isfied with the record of 12 feet 1 21-100
inches.
Norman E. Dole, Stanford's crack
pole vaulter, was undoubtedly the hero
cf the day. and will be looked upon as

Favorites took three of the six events

laid up but little coin.
In the Introductory selling sprint T.

easily. The filly's price was forced from
evens down to 7 to 10, and 6he won run

lor the big colt ran an indifferent third.
IIORTOX WIXS TnE HANDICAP.
The mile and a sixteenth handicap
saw Horton, carrying 102 pounds, score
his first win for Charley McCafferty.
Grafter, the mount of "Big Bill"
Knapp. had a decidedly strong follow
ing and went to the post an 8 to 5 fa
vorite. For something less than a mile
Gorgalette. closely pressed by Veter
ano, cut out the running. Gorgalette
tired, and approaching the paddock
Dugan on Horton came with an old
time rush, disposing of Veterano- by
nearly a length. The favorite, which
appeared to run In spots, finished a
close third, lapped on the place horse.
Divina wheeled at the start, being
practically left. The winner was 10 to
1 in the betting.
There was nothing to the mile and a
half number but Colonel Anderson. T.
McLaughlin's recent purchase ruled an
odds-on choice and won galloping from
Rio Shannon and Theodora L,. Blessed
Damozel pulled up lame.
Newly furnished and decorated and
fitted out with turbine engines, Ana

a half furlong purse run. While not
consistent, perhaps. Ananias is pos

"Walter passed Tonopah on the back
stretch, and everybody thought It all
over. But at the head of the stretch
the favorite let his tray of dishes drop,
and Tonopah, going to the front and
well # handled by his medical adviser,

ridden by Mr. Fately. closed with a late
rush, beating Waiter out of the place.
Miss Sallie Long presented the suc

The Tigers did nothing in the ninth.
But the Oaks did much. Dunleavy tore
off a hit and Serially walked. Streib fol
lowed the example of Dun, and the
bags were filled. Devereaux had noth

struck out. A sigh of relief was heaved
by all when Moskiman responded with
his drive to right field that broke it all
up. The score:

It was Doc Moskiman whom the fans
were wont to praise when the strife at
Recreation Park had ended yesterday.
It was the Doc who lined the leather
to the right field In the ninth when
the bags were all decorated with Oak
landers. It was the Doc who gave the
Oakland rooters heart palpitations from
the call of time by walking -eight of
the Tigers, but every one forgave him
when he soaked the ball at the most
critical period of the game. Score â
Oakland 3, Tacoma 2.
Although the battle consumed two
hours of valuable time, it was a good
one to gaze at, and no one can say his
money's worth was not forthcoming.
Oakland landed one in the initial
round, when Dunleavy brought Kruger
in from second with a beautiful drive
to the score board. But the Tigers
came back in the second. McLaughlln
was treated to a pass, and sprinted
around from first to home on Hannl
van's single to deep center field.
Then the game was quiet till the
fifth, when another Oaklander regis
tered. Francks was passed and Streib
hit safely. Franks got around to third,
and he and Streib started the double
steal. Graham threw badly to Casey,
and the fleet-footed "Buck" scampered
to the rubber on the return throw. A
deadlock was created again when Mos
kiman passed two more of the Tigers
in the seventh and Devereaux fumbled
an easy one. With the bags full Truck
Egan sent a long fly out to right field
and the run followed.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS
I In the seventh Stanford had the
bases filled twice, but could only get
one run. Ball hit to left and stole sec
ond. Strub walked Chalmers and Wirt
bunted safely, thus filling all the cor
ners. There were no outs and it looked
bad for California. Sales bunted, too,
and forced Ball off the board. In try
ing to catch Sales at first, Graham
missed Bliss* throw and let the ball go
by into Gillis' hands. Chalmers saw the
mistake and dove for the plate, Gillis*
erratic throw saving, him from being
caught. The bases were still full of
Stanfordltes, but Strub braced up and
struck out the next two, so that Cali
fornia was able to crawl out of a small
hole.
STRUB PITCHES GOOD BAMj.
Strub pitched in the place of Heit
muller, the change having been made
at the last minute. His performance
was creditable and on a par with that
of Sales of Stanford. Striib held the
Stanfordltes down to* five scattering
hits, while Sales allowed six, three of
which were bunched In the disastrous
eighth. Sales ' was better . on strike
outs and, delivery. Gunn took Strub's
regular hold-out at third and Heitmul
ler occupied left garden in place of
Hamilton, who is on the sick list The

Stolen bases â Chalmers. Ball, Graham 2.
Errors â Sales. Colbert. Gillis 2. Double play

â Tappy Green. Scorerâ James A. Force.
The upshot of that scrimmage was
two runs for California and prospects
of more with Heitmuller perched on
third. The prospects materialized when
Graham came up and swatted it past
third for a safety and "Heine" trotted
homeward. There were still more pros
pects, but Graham ended it all by get
ting caught off at first.
While all this was going on afield
something else was going on on the
bleachers. California's rooters seemed
to feel that it was up to them to help
win and they manufactured a frightful
din. It was enough to frighten a phi
losopher. When three runs walked
across the plate - the crowd went wild.
California achieved the first run in
its half of the first inning. With two
out, Strub got to first on Colbert's er
ror and scored on Heitmuller's two
bagger to deep center. The rest of the
innings, with the exception of number
8, were goose eggs for California.
Chalmers made Stanford's first run
in the second. He reached first on Gil-
Hs* â¢ wild throw to first, stole second
and came across on Sales' hit to cen
ter. ; A 'Â¦Â¦Â¦-
It was not Stanford University's day
to shine at baseball yesterday at Idora
Park, Oakland, and the championship
of the colleges went to the University
of California after a pretty struggle.
Neither side has much to crow over,
however, and the score of 4 to 2 does
not tell the whole story by a great deal.
Stanford's lead up to the eighth, with
every prospect of holding it to the end,
kept California hearts a-thumping
against anxious breasts and nobody
could figure, from the way they were
going at it, that the pets of Berkeley
could pull out a victory. But the Stan
ford players let in three runs in that
fatal eighth, and from that time it
was easier breathing on the blue and
gold side.
It was a heart-breaking contest up
to the memorable eighth round. First
California got a run, then Stanford
got one, and then Stanford got an
other. That made it 2 to 1 when Cali
fornia came up to bat ror the eighth
time. Sweesy was thrown out at first
by Williams and Gillis flew to Trow
bridge, and, with two down, it looked
as if California was all in.
In baseball, however, they never say
die, and Calif ornia was after the last
desperate chance. Adams came up and
hit one to left that landed him on first.
Sales walked Strub to first, and that
forced Bliss, who was. running for
Adams, to second. With two men on
bases, Heitmuller came to the bat, pre
pared to do or die. He was still smart
ing under a previous strikeout and
looked for revenge. He got It, for after
a strike and two balls had been called
on him he lined one past first base to
right, bringing in Bliss and Strub.

II HOW I CURE i
1 WEAK, PUNY MEN! I
i Â«m ' ' lm
el Give me a man broken down from excesses," dissipation, boyish folly, S
I 7 hard work or worry, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let htm 2j
1 â¢ follow my. advice for three months and I will make him as vigorous In *â¢
1 â¢ every respect as any man of his age. *Â»
~ Â¦Â¦'-."' I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never Intended Jz
â¢ by nature to be strong and sturdy. Even that man I can make better than â¢
9 he is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength I can 9
9 make as good as he ever was. O
â¢ I can give back to any man what he has lost by abuse of the laws of â¢
9 nature. I can stop all drains upon the vital power in ten days. ' â..â¢
â¢ A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who- sleeps bad- â¢
â¢ ly, awakes more tired than when he went to bed,' who is easily discouraged. â¢
9 inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and en- O
a ergy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which the Dr. 9
\ 0 McLaughlin electric Belt supplies. q
\ 0 The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal 9
Â¦ g electricity. When you lose that by draining the system in any manner my a
Z Belt will replace it and will cure you. Z
0 Mr. Harry U. Jackson, Valletoc. Cal.. writes: "Althousn you are a stranger 9
to me, my heart warms toward you as a ereat benefactor and friend and 1 am 2
j J more than Krateful to you. Already I can feel the visor of new life In my body: JJ
â¢Â» no aches and no pains. I wish you every success in your work." â¢
2 _. Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. 5
V They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from use- â¢
9 less doctoring. I get such letters everyday. #
Â© My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces â¢
â¢ and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man. #
â¢ / , I make the best electrical body appliance in the world*, having devoted â¢
â¢ twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade, aiy cures after every- â¢
9 thing else has failed are my best arguments. * 9
9 Mr. Roy Burks, McKlttricks, Cal., writes: , â¢â¢From the first night I wore the belt â¢
0 I felt new life in every part of my body. The drain stopped Immediately and I am 9
a now able to do heavy work without tiring. I am glad I thought of the belt, for In a
J no other way could the money bring me so much pleasure." â¢ Jf
Give me a man with pains In his back, a dull ache in his muscles or S
X joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest and side. Sciatica in 2
2 his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism or any ache or pain, and my Belt will â¢
2 pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain. 'Â©
â¢ No pain can exist where my Belt is worn. Â©
| O Mr. J. L. Baird of Orland, Cal.. writes: "My back Is entirely well, and I would
i 9 not take $1CO for my belt If I could not get another. It is the best thing on earta O
|0 for a lame back." 0
â¢ They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet O
9 In the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt. O
0 Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you 2
0 ought to be, can you ask any better proof to make you try it? Is there a m
x remedy which Is as simple, as easy to use, as sure to cure, and as cheap as â¢
2 Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must try it In â¢
â¢ Justice to yourself, and to those who look to you for their future happi- 9
9 ness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not to be delayed O
9 It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes A
0 no trouble. You feel the gentle, glowing heat from it constantly, but no m
0 sting, no burning, as In old-style belts. 2
Z Send for my beautiful book, full of things a man -likes to read if he Z
J wants to bs a strong man. I will send it, sealed, free. Cut out this ad. ' â¢

NEW YORK, April 23. â To-day's
stock market was colorless and in
conclusive. The small dealings were
transacted at little variation in prices,
and news developments were ignored
and were without power to move the
market. The engagement of $4,600,000
in gold for shipment to Paris on Tues
day was announced, and probable fur
thar shipments on that date were out
lined. The signature of the contract
of sale of the Panama canal brings the
arrangement of the payments Into the
immediate field of the exchange mar
ket. It Is evident that in the present
condition of the exchange market gold
is the cheapest form of remittance, and
it would not cause surprise if the
total $40,000,000 that is to be paid to
French stockholders should .go out in
gold. The bank statement shows
how money continues to accumulate
here and explains the easy outward
movement of gold. Total sales of
bonds, $1,310,000.
The growing dullness of the opera
tions in stocks this week has not re
sulted in any loss of ground so far as
prlcesare concerned. There were occa
sional recessions, which were made up
as. the sentiment of tfie traders varied
from day to day or as their operations
on one side of the market proving un
successful were followed by the clos
ing up of small speculative contracts.
The neglect of the market is largely
attributed by public opinion in the
street to the prospect of long drawn
out litigation over the question, of the^
manner of distributing the < assets of
the Northern Securities. But it may
be questioned whether other and
deeper lying causes are riot behind tho
hesitation shown in the securities mar
kets lioth here and abroad. -
Money on call and . ordinary time
loans are in redundant ' supply, with
very slack demand, while railroad and
corporation notes running from one to
three years command a high rate of
interest in our _ own market and capital
issues in .other form are withheld for
lackof an absorptive demand. Another
factor; in the money market that Is re
ceiving increasing attention- is the
growing supply" of new gold, both from
the .Transvaal and from Alaska, with
the 'prospect of a; still further increase
in' the irate of production.
The bond .market has- been dull and
sluggish, and has moved conformably
with the stock " market. Uijited States'
2*s â¢ and the â¢ old ' 4's have declined Â¦ %,
while ; the" 3's have advanced % and the
new 4's 7-8 on call during; the week.
. NEWARK, N. J., April 23. â Three
firemen were killed and fifteen others
injured to-day at a flre in a six-story
brick building on Mechanic street, oc
cupied by, Welner & Co., saddlery
hardware manufacturers. Whiie the
flre was at its height a score of fire
men were on the roof of the building
of the Empire Gear arid Top Company,
a one-stock brick structure, adjoining
the Weiner building. An explosion oc
curred In the. Welner building, which
blew out the wall of that building 1 and
three stories of the side wall of, the
Weiner structure crashed down on the
firemen. .-The -building on the roof of
which they were standing was smashed
like an eggshell and the men were
buried under a huge mass of brick
and timber. Three of the firemen
were in a dying condition when taken
out. Two iied on the way to the hos
pital and the third just after reaching
there. The dead are:

PATRICK J. DONOHUE.
JACOB BLEYLE.
Among the Injured firemen were the
Chief of the department, Robert F.
Klerstead; Battalion Chief Morgan and
Captains Wolf and' Russell
Bercaugh. ', Chief Kierstead was
knocked down by the concussion and
was hit by falling bricks and other
debris. He, however, insisted on re
maining 1 | to direct the Vwork of rescue,
although hardly able to stand. When
the collapse, came the other firemen
stopped lighting the flames and rushed
to the aid of their comrades, who were
buried in the wreckage. The rescuers
worked with; desperation and in a
short time all the j firemen were taken
out/and- hurried to the hospitals. .Qf
the / injured^flrerrien ; Ross cannot re
cover and Frederick A. Reifl* Is intern
ally. Injuredand mayhot recover.-
The loss is estimated at $50,000.

Smart society folks earnestly toiling
for charity, and. scores' 'of eager patrons
paying homage to a worthy cause
made an interesting picture at the fete
given by the Chrysanthemum Auxiliary
yesterday afternoon at Sorosis Club.
The Chrysanthemums themselves in
their most irresistible gowns and hats
fluttered from foom to room with words
of welcome or^presided at the tables
with Inviting smiles.
There was a table of home-made
cakes and another for candy. A flower
booth gave an, artistic touch of color,
and a fancy work table was equipped
with articles of use and beauty. A flsh
pond contained the unexpectedâ which
always pleases, and a fortune telling
booth, wherein Mrs. Harvey Toy read
hands, proved an important attraction.
An unsually fine musical programme
consisted of songs by Mrs. John E.
Birmingham, Miss Laura Taylor and
Miss Josephine Lindley; a violin selec
tion by Miss Laura Howland, and a
piano solo by Miss Ruth Powers.
Considerable interest also centered in
the raflles, and tickets were sold for
pictures by H. T. Latimer, Dr. Arnold
Genthe, Mrs. Loosely and another San
Francisco artist of note. A handsome
bust was also raffled.
The Chrysanthemums appointed to
serve upon committees and to preside
over the tables were as follows:
Flowersâ Mrs. Andrew Welch, Mrs.
John Chase, Miss Zelda Tiffany and
Miss Edna Hannigan.
Refreshmentsâ Miss Mabel Toy, Miss
Mabel Hogg, Miss Rachel Hovey and
Mrs. Harvey M. Toy.
Fancy workâ Miss Georgie Spieker.
Miss Norma Castle. Mis* Georgie
Shepard and Miss Ruth Gedney.
Fish pondâ Mrs. Jack Wilson. Miss
Paula. Wolff and Miss Laura Taylor.
Candyâ Mrs. Edward Hume, Miss
Mabel Donaldson, Miss Hovey, Miss
Tiffany and Mrs. Harvey M. Toy.
Entertainmentâ Miss Laura Taylor
and Miss Mabel Toy.
Printingâ Mrs. Richard Bahls and
Miss Hovey. â¢
The young. women are gratified over
the success of a he fete, as everything
was sold. The proceeds will be devoted
to the Chrysanthemum fund, which '
provides a free bed from year to year
in the Children's Hospital.
The collection, which has been on
exhibition, recently in Los Angeles,
Pasadena and Santa Barbara, will be
shown for a few days here and after
the St. Louis Exposition will be taken
to New York and Boston.
The studio of Mrs. May Mott-Smith
Bird at 231 Post street was the scene
of considerable interest yesterday af
ternoon, when many Invited guests
attended a private view of a collection
of her hand-made Jewelry which is
atiout to be placed in the art exhibit
at the St. Louis Exposition.
Mrs. Bird is a young artist of high
standing, who, from love of precious
stones, devote3 her talents to making
replicas of antique jewelry, reproduc
ing the general designs of the ancients;
some of them as far back as the
Etruscan style. In originating orna
ments, some of which are decidedly
barbaric . In character, Mrs. Bird
brinps to her antique effects the in
telligent use of tone color that comes
from her early training in art, giving
an added charm to her creations.
She shows a marked taste for jade,
in dull gold settings, and opal mat
rices,, which she combines with very
odd stones. A thumb ring which ex
cited considerable comment yester
day included a large, uncut sapphire,
rare nearls and fine enameling. An
other odd. conceit was a dog collar of
turquoise matrices and pearls set in
exquisitely wrought gold. A necklace
of Philippine pearls set in unfinished
gold, with an immense opal pendant,
attracted much admiration.
Splendid Collection to Interna
tional Exposition.

" I had suffered for three years with
terrible pains at the time of menstrua-

was until the doctor pronounced it in-
flammation of the ovaries, and
proposed an operation.
.-;,*' I felt so weak and sick that I felt
sure that I could not survive the ordeal,
and so I told hinvthat I would hot un-
dergo it. The following .^week I \ read
an advertisement in i. the paper of your
Vegetable Compound in such an emer-
gency, and so I decided, to try it. Great
was my joy to find that I actually im-
proved | after., taking '.two bottles, so \ I
kept taking it for ten weeks, and at the
>nd of that time I was . cured. I had ;
gained eighteen: pounds '; and- was in
excellent health, and am now. . â¢*

At least this was the Information
that was conveyed to Harriman, who,
however, got the tip recently that the
Santa Fe was again looking over the
Martin syndicate's property. Then
Harrlroan immediately set about get
ting hold of the road and effected his
plans Quietly three months ago. Mean
while, however, the Santa Fe had
aroused further anxiety among the
Harriman crowd by boldly sending its
freight agents into Northern Califor
i;ia in search of contracts for hauling
the fruit product, and publicly an
nouncing that it purposed to get a
large share of the business, support
ing Its boast with the statement that
ii had its own cars and could afford to
handle the fruit to an advantage to
not only itself, but the shippers.
Later the Santa Fe purchased a
rouple of river steamers and followed
thi3 move by acquiring the necessary
rights of way for a road up the Sac
ramento River, from Antloch to the
<ity of Sacramento. It was about this
lime that Harriman began to corre
tpond with Ripley regarding the pos
sibility .of their coming together In
Northern California on amicable terms,
and the bait eventually landed Ripley
in the Harriman camp, with proposi
tions that the Harriman-iSchiff concern
were not slow in accepting.
Yesterday Harriman held a long con
ference In his office with James Still
man*, president of the National City
rank of New York, who is expected
to furnish some of the coin that will
be 'needed to carry out the plans for
extending the California Northwestern
and making other improvements
agreed on by himself and Ripley.
l.ater I. W. Hellman Jr., of the Union
Trust Company, who Is identified In
a financial way with many of the Har
riman interests in California, and John
It will be a third-rail project, but so
const nicted as to overcome much of
the element of danger that attends the
opefatlon of a similar service on the
North Shore road, and will be of suf
ficient magnitude to anticipate in
creased traffic across the bay for fif
teen years. Just before the two mag
nates finished their conference Harri
mnn informed Ripley that the Southern
Pacific has under consideration *a
scheme for operating a line of small
steamer* between the town of Sonoma
and the bay, with a view of relieving
the company's road of much of its
.lighter freight, and at the same time
creating a competitor for a line that is
now being organized for the same busi
ness In that section of the State.
That Harriman had been suing for
peace with Ripley for some time has
been no secret among a number of
financiers in this city, and the hurried
arrival here Friday morning of Ripley
and the conference that followed is
no great surprise. The determination
Khnwn by the Santa Fe to build a line
to caused no small alarm in
the Harriman camp a year go. and
prompted the financial representative
of Jacob Schiff to hasten his agents
into a conference with A- W. Foster of
the Â¦California Northwestern with the
view of getting hold of that road. For
a time the Santa Fe had an option on
the North Shore road, but allowed It
io lapse after the engineers of the
Santa Fe had decided that the small
coast line had no particular advantages
for the Eureka project other than the
bay terminal it owns at Sausalito.
REFERS PLANS TO BANKERS.
OAKLAND IMPROVEMENTS.
in the northern country, through which
l>oth have been planning to build com
peting lines at an expense that their
respective engineers have estimated
will reach into many millions of dol-
Icrs.
UTPE OUT LITIGATION.
By extending the line from Eureka
i< nd the other from Willits to an agreed
lÂ»oint of union the two magnates will
a!so DOOM to an amicable settlement of
the'r legrai battle over terminal rights
in the town of liureka. There is now
on appeal a suit involving the right of
Harriman's roatl. the Eureka and Kla
rr.ath River, to enter the town of Eu
reka. Recently in this suit, which was
brought by A. B. Hammond, with
whom Harriman is interested, the
court gave a Judgment in favor cf the
Eureka and Klamath River road,
against the San Francisco and North
western Railway, which, by right of its
purchase of the Eel River and Eureka
road, held the city front of the north
ern harbor.
The two magnates have also agreed
that as soon as it is deemed practicable
the California Northwestern will
be connected with the Napa Valley
branch of â¢ tire Southern Pacific, which
will greatly facilitate the shipment of
fruit from points In Napa Valley to
this city. At present the Southern Pa
cific hauls its perishable freight from
the valley to this city in a roundabout
way, via Suisun and Benicia, whereas"
by way of the proposed shorter connec
tion at Napa the fruit can be shipped
to San Francisco via Tiburon in a
great deal quicker time. â¢
IIAIUUMAN TO DOMINATE.
Another arrangement entered into by
Harriman and Ripley, and personally
approved by thejn at their meting Fri
day, was that the California North
western shall, as soon as through con
nections are made with Eureka, be
used almost exclusively for heavy traf
lic, and Its passenger traffic, in so far
es^ It is possible, and particularly be
tween this city and San Rafael, will be
diverted to the North Shore road, the
rolling stock of which will be increased
and Its road bed improved for that pur
pose. Later the Cazadero end of the
'North Shore road will be extended and
its main line and branches overhauled.
It was further agreed that, while
both the Southern Pacific and the
tianta Ft are hereafter to be jointly in
terested in the various California
linos mentioned. Harriman will, on the
surface, continue to appear as the
dominating power. It is also known
that Ilarriman received from Ripley
certain concessions in Oakland relative
to riehts^f way and the future policy
â¢if the two roads, but the particular
features of these are yet a secret be
tween the two railroad presidents.
Harriman, however, informed Ripley
that his director of maintenance
and operations, Julius Kruttschnitt,
had flnally, after months . of
< xperiments, solved the question
af= to the best method of sub
stituting electric power for steam
on thÂ» Oakland, Berkeley and Alameda
â¢ Jo-'al service, and that an elaborate;
< lectric service would roon be installed
across the bay.
To-day these men will have another
talk, at which A. W. Foster has been
invited to be present, and within a few
days Harriman will have completed all
his arrangements for the undertaking
which will be carried out in the future
under the direction of Director of
Maintenance and Operations Krutt
schnitt of the Harriman lines.
Martin, president of the North Shore
road, were called Into the conference,
which lasted until late in the day.
To Stillman aud Hellman Harriman
first explained the needs of much
financiering in connection with the
projects devised by himself and Rip
ley, and then Julius Kruttschnltt, who
is always on hand to furnish data to
his chief, entered into an elaborate de
scription of the work that will be nec
essary to carry out all that has been
planned by Harriman and Ripley and
the rolling stock and other railroad ma
terial that will be required to put the
project on a modern footing for opera
tion.

Another meeting will be held next
Tuesday evening at the Town and
Gown-Club, when the question of ways
and means will be considered further.
The women of Berkeley are going to
undertake the furnishing of the ju
venile room of the Carnegie Library.
They are not only going to undertake
the enterprise, but they stand commit
ted to the task of really accomplish
ing it, and there will be no backing
out It will cost $2500 to do the work,
but that big sum does not frighten the
ladles a bit, and they will not let up
until they get it all.
The first step toward securing this
sum was taken this afternoon, when a
number of women met at the Town
and Gown Club. Mrs. Frank M. Wil
son, president of the club, called the
meeting to order, and after Mrs. Julia
Sanborn had been elected chairman the
ladies got down to work. First, they
found out the approximate cost of the
work, and then they talked about the
various ways of gathering the money.
It was finally decided that the -best
way was to appoint a ways and means
committee to plan a campaign, and
the chairman appointed the following
named -committee: Mrs. Frank M.
Wilson, Mrs. Joseph Le Conte, School
Superintendent S. D. Waterman, Mrs.

ing red badges, formed themselves
into general electioneering commit
tees to urge the approaching voter to
cast his ballot for the bonds. The
children of the city have realized
probably more than any one else the
need for new buildings. The subject
of room is one that has constantly
confronted Superintendent McCly
monds and the Board of Education.
Makeshift buildings have been erect
ed and basements finished off in order
to accommodate the pupils. Every
school is crowded and overrun and
the question of new buildings is a ne
cessity.
The polling places were at the twen
ty-one schoolhouses of the city.
The question of bonding the city for
the 1 purpose of building new school
houjÂ»esÂ« and generally improving the
cchool system of the city is one that
the present Board of Education has
made its special object during the
present term. Superintendent Mc-
Clymonds. in speaking on the subject
said to-night: "We are all very much
pleased and gratified. It has been
something that the board has been
deeply Interested in and worked hard
to have carried."
But two precincts in the city failed
to carry the proposition. In the Per
altaiannex but eight votes were cast
and three of these were aeainst the
bonds and five for them. As it needed
a two-thirds vote to carry the elec
tion this district as a unit failed to
carry the question. The other district
is the Harrison School district in
which 129 votes v/ere cast for the
bonds and 71 against This was less
than the required tv.o-thirds.
The school bond election held here
to-day resulted in a victory for those
in favor of the bonds and the propo
sition to spend $900,000 for the im
provement of the schools of the city
was carried by a vote of 3329 for to
C2u apainst. or a little more than five
to one. While the vote was light the
â¢question was one that generally inter
ested the city and much satisfaction
is expressed to-night at the result of
the election.

George Arristide was sentenced to
serve five years in Folsom penitentiary
by Judge Lawlor on a charge of bur
glary. He broke into the warehouse
of W. B. Sanborn, 103 Vallejo street
and pleaded guilty on May 5, 1902.
Owing to hia youth the Judge sus
pended sentence on his promise that
he would behave himself. â¢ He has not
done so.
A number of prisoners appeared for
sentence in the courts of Judges Law
lor and Dunne yesterday. With them
and those to be arraigned and to plead
there were thirty-six altogether. Judge
Cook's court waB closed and If his
quota had been brought from the
County Jail there would have been
more than fifty prisoners.
Nicola Crudo, who was convicted by
a jury of murder in the first degree
with the penalty of imprisonment for
life, was formally sentenced by Judge
Lawlor after motions for a new trial
and arrest of Judgment had been de
nied. The place of confinement Is

t!:e latter in Folsom penitentiary.
"I believe Parker will be the Demo
cratic nominee, but there Is really no
use of his being put up, for Roosevelt
will sweep the country. If Parker re
ceives the nomination there will be a
certain element of Wall street that will
back him because they know he could
be handled if by a slip he should bo
elected. The same element will op
pose Roosevelt because he cannot be
handled."
"Whom do you think will be the Re
publican nominee for Vice President?"
was asked.
"Fairbanks of Indiana. I know of
no more popular man for the place and
I think he will be elected. He has
been spoken of by men I have met
from all over the country and with
such favor that there is little doubt
of his being the choice for Roosevelt's
running mate.
"I have been in politics for twenty
eight years and know how the Ger
man vote stands. It will be solidly
Republican, for they all remember th%
hard times of Cleveland's administra
tions and will have no more of it
"When a man- begins to feel well
after being sick and likes to take an
interest in politics, as I do, he is anx
ious to get home, and that is my fix.
This is my first trip to California and
I have enjoyed it very much. I havÂ»
learned from your people that they
are going to roll up a good majority
for the Republican ticket in Novem
ber."
"There are good m*>n In the Demo
cratic party. They are good Ameri
cans and they can't stand Hearst Illi
nois, expects to have a Democratic can
didate of her own in the person of
Congressman J. R. Williams, who has
been repeatedly elected from a Repub
lican district He is a different class
of Democrat from Hearst and is looked
upon â¢ with favor by . Carter Harrison
and other leading men of his party.
No, Hearst will not have any of th*
delegates from Illinois.
PARKER THE DEMOCRAT.
"No man can beat Roosevelt I can
say that with considerable knowledge
of conditions cot only in my own State,
but from facts gathered during my
trip. In Southern California I met peo
ple from s.U over the United States.
I talked politics with hundreds of them
and there is but one conclusion to be
drawn. Roosevelt will " be elected with
the largest vote ever given any Presi
dent
"Illinois will roll up a Republican
majority of at least 100,000, no matter
who the Democrats nominate. Our
State is solidly Republican and many
Democrats are going to vote for Roose
velt." â¢.â¢;!
"How do the Democrats of Illinois
view Hearst as a candidate?" was
asked.
CANT BEAT ROOSEVELT.
Henry Alexander, one of the most
prominent stockmen of Illinois and the
man who practically controls the Ger
man vote of the upper portion of the
State, is in this city, accompanied by
Mrs. Alexander and his daughter.
Mr. Alexander is a stanch Republi
can. He came to the coast several
months ago for his health, but during
his absence from home has been elected
a delegate to the Republican State Con
vention, which meets in Springfield
May 12, to nominate a State ticket,
delegates to the national convention
and Presidential Electors. That haÂ»
been the custom for years and the Ger
mans for miles around Joliet would
not consider themselves properly rep
resented if Mr. Alexander were not a
delegate.
At present Mr. Alexander is stop
ping at the Palace, having arrived from
Ocean Park yesterday. He will leave
for Los Angeles on Wednesday, as he
is anxious to be home by May 1. When
asked for his opinion on the political
situation as he knows it and has heard
he said:
Jeffries met his bride in New York
City four years ago and saw more or
less of her each time he visited the
metropolis. The last time he went there
he was constantly in her society, and
when he left her it was with the under
standing that she would follow him
out to California, which she did.
Jeffries always had a warm spot in
his heart for Oakland, which was the
scene of his training for his first cham
pionship fight, and from which time
his star eteadlly arose until he
reached the zenith of his fame. Eugene
Van Court was one of the friends he
made when training at the Reliance
Club, and to whom he appealed to see
to the necessary arrangements for his
marriage.
Little is known here of the antece
dents of Miss Mayer, who, it is said,
has lived all her life in New York City.
OAKLAND, April 23.â James J. Jef
fries, champion fighter of the world,
has fallen a victim to Cupid's darts
and was married here this evening to
a New York girl by the name of Frieda
Mayer, who, by arrangement, came to
California two weeks ago. Yesterday
Jeffries telephoned Eugene Van Court
to make necessary arrangements for
the marriage licence and the perform
ance of the ceremony, and at 8 o'clock
this evening Van Court and Deputy
County Clerk Glover repaired to the
County Clerk's office, where the license
was issued. The bridal party, consist
ing of Jeffries, Miss Mayer, Billy De
laney and a Mrs. Ackerman, repaired
to the office of Justice of the Peace
Mortimer Smith, on Broadway, where
the two were quickly made one.
The big fighter seemed in the best of
spirits and was a striking contrast to
his petite bride, who is but five feet
two inches tall and weighs but 132
pounds. Jeffries la over six feet tall
and weighs 230 pounds. They will pass
their honeymoon at Harbin Springs.
Mrs. Jeffries is a striking brunette
with dark eyes and hair and acknowl
edges to 29 summers, and is just three
weeks younger than her big husband.
Hatless and coatless, Archie Jef
ferey, a patient in the Receiving Hos
pital, left that institution some time
during the night unknown to the at
tendants, and it is feared that he has
committed suicide by jumping into the
bay. He attempted suicide some time
yesterday by cutting his throat. Along
toward evening he went to the hos
pital for treatment He had inflicted
a wound In the left side of the neck,
but missed the jugular vein, and a lit
tle court plaster and a bandage served
for a dressing.
When the attendants made their
rounds this morning after an unusually
quiet night they found Jefferey's cot
empty. He had partially dressed him
self, but had neglected to take either
hat or coat, and Steward Borchert
fears the man got up in the night and
carried out his idea of self-destruction.
There were no serious cases in the
hospital last night that required the
attention of nurses, and nothing dis
turbed the slumbers of the attendants
through the night There had been no
attempt to restrain the patient, who
went of his own accord to the hospital,
and had been given some supper and
a bed. Why he should have left In
the way he did is puzzling those in
charge of the place.
He would say nothing about himself,
but in one of his pockets was found a
union card showing that he was a
member of the Cooks' and Waiters*
Union. It is not known at what time
he left, and no one has been found that
seen him go. It is feared he went to
the foot of Broadway, a few blocks
away, and jumped into the bay.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
SAN JOSE, April 24.â A masked rob
ber entered the Del Monte Club on Finst
street near Santa Clara this morning
shortly after 1 o'clock and held up half
a dozen men who were in the lounging
room. The bandit lined up his victims
against the wall, and after taking a
5900 ring from William George, robbed
the till of $500. â¢
The robber was armed with two re
volvers. The. mask was a red bandana
handkerchief. As he left the building,
backing out with pistols leveled, the
proprietor hurried after him and flred
several shots. The robber ran across
the street and was pursued by a police
man. Other policemen were soon at the
scene and nearly twenty shots were
flred by the robber and his pursuers.
The bandit made his escape into a lum
ber yard and had not been captured at

CHICAGO, April 23. â The excellent weather
in the Southwest caus-'d an extremely weak
opening in wheat, the May option being down
l%c to 2?Â»c at 86c to 87%c July was off
%&%c to %c at S3%c ta 84c. Almost every
one who had any long wheat appeared anxious
to t.ell. The greatest pressure was in May.
An effort to liquidate holdings in that de
livery started free sellLng of the more, dis
tant futures, rteulting in still further losses.
May 60iÂ« off to &5*Â»c and July to OSVic. The
decline was Intensified by weakness in all out-
Fide markets. On the break shorts began 1 to
cover and offerings were absorbed eo rapidly
that a fair recovery was made. May showed
the ereattst advance, the price soon reaching
the opening figure. Prices fluctuated nerv-jus
ly during the latter part of the session, but
the market in general was inclined to remain
mar the low level. The close was weak, with
July at S3?4c. After May had sold up to
87 %c there was another reaction, the close
be!:ig at 87%Â©87?4c. a net loss of l@l%c.
The slumo in wheat and Improved weather
conditions caused a weak opening in the corn
pit. but <n spite of these adverse clrcum
uan'tt, a firm undertone was manifested at
times. The market closed steady at the de
cline. July opened %@Â«4c to %Â©%c lower at
47Â»4c to 47Tic, Bold between 47%c and 48%c,
and closed at 47%c. May ranged between 47c
and 47*4c and closed at 47%c.
There was a comparatively firm market in
Oats, the buying being of good character.
After opening %Â©%c to Â«&@%c lower at
35%c to 35&c, July ranged between 35%c
and 36c and closed at S5%@35%c.
Provisions eased off some early In the day,"
Influenced by the weakness In grains, but thero
was little oroduct pressing for sale and the
demand from shorts and -packers was sufficient
to lift prices to a slightly higher level. The
market closed steady, with . July pork un
changed at $12 25. July lard and ribs were
each 2%Â§5c higher at f6 SO and ?6 57%, re
spectively.

is dull and easy, but no lower.
CASH BARLEY.
Chicago continued to decline and lost an
other cent. Crop conditions continue to govern
that market. The private wires of Mitchell.
Mulcahy & Co. from there yesterday said that
the weather had suddenly turned very fine all
over the West. Minneapolis reported that with
a few days of this fine weather nothing further
would be heard about late seeding. Indiana
sent in a gloomy report that the State would
have the smallest crop in thirty years. Mis
sour! reported the outlook excellent and as
good as ever before. Nebraska reported the
prospect fine. All Eastern Kansas was reported
as before, but the western part was sending in
some complaints.
Futures were again lower in this market, but
there was no change In the cash grain.

Receipts of Strawberries were 69 chests from
near-by sections and 47 crates from Los An
geles. Dealers had firm ideas at the opening
and were asking $1 per drawer for the best
Longworths and the larger varieties were held
at 50060c per drawer, but as there was very
little demand at those, figures prices receded,
and late in the afternoon fine berries could b<?
bought at liberal concessions. A portion of
the receipts of large berries from Watsonville
came to hand in bad condition, being covered
with mud and otherwise poor and were hard
to dispose of even at the minimum quotation.
A crate of Raspberries came in from Los An
geles and sold at 17%Â®20c per small basket.
A fair trade was noted in Oranges, but the
market continued weak owing to the abun
dance of low-grade, fruit, which was being
pressed for sale at concessions, and this had a
depressing effect on the sale of good sound
stock. Lemons were a little easier under in
creased receipts, while Grape Fruit and Limes
were steady. : There was nothing new to re
port In other fruits. Ten cars of Oranges are
announced for to-morrow's auction

A good idea of the Butter situation may be
had from the fact that spot stocks are large
and topheavy and that there are at least 700.
000 lbs of oold storage Butter left over from
last year. Some houses place the quantity as
high as J. 000,000 lbs. This is enormous. There
is no market for this stored product at pres
ent, and it Is being offered down to 16c and
even less. Under the circumstances dealers
art very timid about storing any fresh goods,
especially as the quantity of-stored Butter in
New York is also vast. One New York hand
ler recently made the remark that New .York
was ashamed to admit how much stored But
ter there was there. At the same time, though
this market Is rather weak than otherwise,
with holders disposed to sell, prices keep up.
There is no further .change in Cheese, the
situation remaining as already stated.
Egga continue steady at unchanged quota
tions. Receipts were larger again yesterday.
The demand Is not lively and dealers are still
storing the surplus
Receipts were 72.2C0 lbs Butter. 1505 cases

Weather Report.
The report of G. N. Salisbury section di
rector. United States Weather Bureau for the
Washington Crop Bulletin week ended April
]Â£ is as follows:
' Although the past winter was mild, it was
loot and unusually wet in thÂ« western division
of the State, while the division east of the
â¢Â¦ascsde Mountains hafl mere than the ordinary
amount of snow in February and March, l.'p
to the end of January there had been little
fnow in most districts and the ground had been
!>are most of the time in the wheat districts,
hut the weather was not severe enough to ma
terially injure the winter wheat. Early in
February there csme an ample enow revering,
end when it finally disappeared, which it did
not completely do in all localities until the
second week in April. It was found that in
raoft instances the winter wheat Â»Â»as urin
lurej and in thrifty condition. The new
...--,.Â» xry liave a good tffert in smothering
<^ut the wild oats. The ample precipitation
thoroughly soaked the soil, which is expected
to be very beneficial to all crops. Orchards
were not inju'e*} during the winter.
"Although March had no severe cold spelie.
R Â»â¢Â«* cold throughout with heavy late frosts
and epnrye did net open until the first of April'
As a result of the heavy rains and melting
srow the soil was in most localities too wet
to work until about the 7th of April. Since
thtn it has been dry and unusually warm for
UK season. ,
â¢'Previous to the 7th thÂ«re had been no
s-pring growth worth mentioning, but the ad
vance of warm sunshine following started
phenomenal growth so as to make up in some
measure, for the backwardness of the season.
During the week ended winter wheat has made
rood growth and early spring sown wheat has
oome up. Active progress has been made in
rpring- wheat seeding, which is about half
<!one. and in plowing. Much gardening and
flela plantin- have been done. Pasture* have
preatly Improved. Hops have started. Peach.
â¢ herry. plum and early prune tree? have bum
Into bloom during the pa6t week."

market was In good ehape for sellers through
out the week, fine large Roosters, fat heavy
Hens and large Broilers and Fryers being In
good demand. Small Broilers and Squab
Plgeona were inclined to easiness early In tho
week, .but strengthened toward the end, and
the market was firm and bar^ at the close.
A car of Western is scheduled for to-morrow's
market. Game was in light receipt and cleaned

more liberal ; than on the preceding day, were
not excessive, but deliveries were irregular

in the day extra stock sold down to 8c per
pound. Rhubarb and Peas continued In ex
cessive supply and weak, and large lines were
still unsold at the close. Poor quality Peas
were offering at 75c per sack, but found few

prices. Florida Tomatoes dragged at the re
cently reduced quotations and the stock Is
netting a loss to the importers.

THE PAST DISCLOSED.
THE PRESENT ANALYZED
BV LIVINGSTONE,
Â¦ 428 Eddy st. -
PROF. LIVINGSTONES readings are like
a living pugs of Flammarlon's treatises that
is so electrifying the world to-day. HE IS
NO IMITATOR. His Work Is upon original
lines: PURE THOUGHT. CLEAR VISION.
He TELLS YOU WHAT YOU DESIRE TO
KNOW. AND WORKS IN THE OPEN
LIGHT. AND IS AS CONSPICUOUS FOR
ITS WONDERFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR 1T3 ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
AND VIVID TRUTHFULNESS.
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test is
of little value when the mind is troubled â
you need more substantial aid and' advice.
. This is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
, gives you when you call on him for a first-
class clairvoyant reading. He asks you no
questions, but tells you what you wish to
know.
He does not mention all the I Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted

The End In Bight.
THE PRESENT IMITATION OF UNIONISM
MUST- PASS AWAY.
Within a short time this city will be plunged
into the greatest labor trouble in the history
or this or any other city.
WTiat will be the outcome?
Grant said, "War is hâ I." If he were,
alive to-day he would consider the unionism
of San Francisco worse than war.
The" majority of leaders of labor unions are
so unscrupulous In all their dealings as to be !
| easily recognized as full-fledged anarchists In !
. everything but name. Their sole aim and de- j
elre eeems to be to pull down and destroy |
rather than build up and foster. They care
nothing for either the safety or convenience
of the public or the welfare of those dependent
' upon the ones under their control.
) What do etrikes bring men to? They tear
i the honest hard working man away from his
' loving wife and family to do the bidding of
these unscrupulous aeltators, aven to defying
the laws, both of God and man: waylay the
honest non-union man. taking him by forCe
I when honestly employed In his occupation, lay-
1 ing his bared arm upon the sidewalk and
Jumping upon It until it was broken and trod-
den to a pulp, using threats and other violence
and In some cases even murder; starves the
innocent wife and children: destroys man's
business and forces him into bankruptcy, prac-
tically kills all commercial business and ad-
vertises world wide the anarchistic tendencies
for which they are noted.
The rreat majority of labor has time and
again proclaimed: "Give them rope enough and
they will hang themselves."
"We will wait and see them do It" has been
the motto of the non-union man, for, after all,
the non-union men are the conservative mÂ»n
of this country, who have always gained the
sympathy of the public, and public opinion
can never be dethroned. â¢
Whatever may be the catastrophe to either
"capital and labor" In the forthcoming strikes
and consequent lockouts, we openyy declare
ourselves before God and man that we 'will
never discriminate.
To the employer so unfortunate as to have
these agitators and walking delegates force
a strike upon them our office will be ever
open, day and night, to supply you with help
you need.
To those more unfortunate because, when
held in the grasp of these unscrupulous agi-
tators, they were compelled to do their bid-
ding by striking on their employers, we ex-
tend an earnest desire to make men of them
and by so doing we will place you' side by
s'de with non-union men.

Dr. Manning appointed the following
committee on permanent organization:
William Peters, M/ D.; E. H. Mercer,
M. D.; C. W. Cory, M. D.; J. E. Hoff
man, M. D.; Mary M. Kroetz, M. D.,
and C. E. Hogg, M. D.
Deputy Health Officer Louis Levy
was directed to send notifications . to
the school physicians, and to furnish
them with cards, etc . It was decided
to hold another meeting next Saturday
evening.
William C Hassler, M. D., chief in
specting, physician, delivered an In
structive talk on sanitary inspection
and answered many questions.
Dr. Ward, in answer to a question,
stated that the schools were in a de
plorable state and that 50 per cent
could be closed by reason of their un
sanitary condition. He said such ac
tion was unwise, as the Board of Edu
cation was . doing, everything in its
power to 'place the schools in a proper
condition and he expressed the hope
that the Supervisors in making up the
new budget would give the Board of
Education a generous appropriation for
the schools. -
The second meeting of the Volunteer
School Inspecting Physicians was held
last evening in the rooms of the Board
of Health. Forty-five physicians were
in attendance and the session was
a highly interesting one.- J. W. Ward,
president of the Board of Health,
opened the meeting, and in the course
of his remarks suggested that the
volunteer physicians organize and elect
officers. He also took occasion to dis
cuss sanitary science and again point
ed out the necessity of school inspec
tion. Dr. Guy E. Manning was elected
temporary chairman and Dr. J. C. Far
mer temporary secretary. .

DEATH CALLS STEPHANIE.
Baroness di Gallotti Succumbs to 111
ncss ln Lcadville, Colorado.
LEADVILLE, Colo., April 23.âSte
phanie, Baroness dl Gallotti di
Napoli, daughter of Signor Ghll
lardi of Milan, Italy, and a second
cousin of the late Queen Victoria of
England, is dead ln this city.
The Baroness was born in Milan in
1S40. When 14 years of age she was
married to Baron dl Gallotti, with
whom she lived happily for many
years. In 1S55 the Baron was exiled
for political reasons from Italy, and a
few years later the couple came to
America. The Baroness was possessed
of a beautiful voice, and in the straits
to which they had been reduced she
found It necessary to use her talents
to raise money. She toured the country
with the leading Italian grand opera
companies in the early sixties. The
Baron died in Denver in 1874. He had
received a letter from the King of
Italy canceling the order exiling him
from his country. The sljock produced
by the Joyful tidings caused his death.
In 1873 the Baroness married Charles
H. Tanner, who was then an attorney
in Denver, and In 1880 the couple came
here, where they have resided ever
since. As age overtook them they
found it more difficult to acquire funds
for living expenses, and frequently suf
fered from want. " V*-"~\ r
Dies .Very Suddenly.
OAKLAND. April- 23. â Charles
Frederick Johnson, a carpenter, died
last night at his -home,' 1308 Wood
â¢street, after a very brief illness. "He
was aged 52 years. The deceased
leaves a wife. An Inquest will be held
to determine the cause of death.
ENJOINS DIRECTORATE.â Judge Murtslcy
1 <$ csttrday issued an Injunction restraining the
General Manager Chapman of the
United Railroads had no news to give
out. When he heard the result of the
vote in the meeting he asked about the
number of men present and was ap
parently pleased to know that less than
half a thousand had attended. He said
th* company had nothing to say and
would await the decision of the men
with perfect confidence that no strike
would be voted.
W'h^n the vote was put by President
Cornelius most of those in the meeting
prose to their feet to shout "Yes.
When a call for "Xo" was asked for
not a single voice responded. The vote
was on the question whether or not
the union should indorse the recom
mendation of the executive committee
that the terms of the company should
be rejected entirely.
. International President Mahon had
nothing to say last night after the
meeting adjourned. "It's up to the
men," he said, "and the ballot will de
termine the question on Monday. The
public knows as much about it as I do.
I made no recommendation and merely
stated the facts in the meeting to
night. None of the officers of the or
ganization has tried to influence the
men in word or deed. They are to be
the so*? judges of the issues involved.
Monday night will tell the tale."
Outwardly he was non-committal,
but between the pauses of his spoken
words it was evident that he did not
believe the company wished to deal
fairly with its employes. He made no
positive recommendations and told the
members of the union that they should
judge fairly on the issue and vote ac
cordingly, but at the close of his
speech he warmed up and gave a
strong indorsement to the action of the
uninns executive committee in advising
a rejection of the terms offered.
Following him came Local President
I'khard Cornelius, who really indorsed
the remarks of Mahon and refrained
from any recommendation. Various
members of the organization spoke
Theneaftpr and there was not one
speaker who failed to denounce thÂ«
i-mpany for its treatment of its em
ployes and counsel a strike. Antag
onism to the United Railroads met al
ways with ready applause. Toward the
Â« lose of the meeting the crowd was
Â« heeling madly as member after mem
br,r arose and expressed his belief that
the terms offered by the company
thould be rejected by the men.

Meeting Has Xo Dissenting
Opinion Regarding Alleged
Wrongs of the Company
Â¦
Five hundred of the 2300 employes of
the United Railroads gathered at the
headquarters of the Carmen's Union
at 210 O'Farrell street last night and
unanimously indorsed the recommend
ation of the executive committee of
the organization that the terms "offered
by the company for a settlement of the
troubles between it and the union shall
cot be accepted.
As many members of the union as
could crowd into the narrow precincts
of the hall were present. Before the
call to order was made the seating ca
pacity had been- exhausted and every
possible inch of standing room was oc
cupied. On the platform vrere Inter
national President Mahon. local Presi
dent Richard Cornelius and two other
Â©facers of the organization.
TVhen the meeting had been called
to order by Cornelius, Mahon stepped
forward without the usual introduction
and stated to the meeting the result of
the conferences between the represent
atives of the union and those of the
United Railroads. There was no ora
tory in h>s speech and nothing but a
dry chronicle of the result of the con
ferences and the vote of the executive
Commit tcee. He explicitly stated that
}\e had no recommendations to give,
and merely wished the men to under
stand that the terms offered by him
were the best he could get from the
company after weeks of pleading.
