Proof that money was handed to Joseph S. Jordan by Clarence Grange, manager of the Phoenix building and Loan Associa
tion, for the purpose of purchasing immunity from Senate inquiry was established at the investigation' of the charges of bribery
commenced last night by the investigating committee of the State Senate. Whether the money reached the hands of the four Sen
ators accused of taking the bribe is a question yet to be answered. So strong is the proof against Jordan that he was arrested last
night at the instigation of the District Attorney of Sacramento. \/^/Â«' ;

keeping 5250 as commission for his part in the deal.
JORDAN RECEIVES THE ROLLS OF BILLS.
Of his commission, the evidence shows. Jordan first received
Â£150, being paid $100 additional at a later date. Former Detective
â¢rge \". Tichenor. now officer of the Continental Building
and Loan Association, testified that he saw Jordan place in the
Viands of Emmons and Bunkers envelopes that contained their
lof the boodle â 5350 each. He did not see French and
Wrigfit paid, he said. Ijecause Jordan had failed to keep an engage
1;n with him by which he hoped to witness the passing of the
money. Jordan told him, however, that he had met French and
Wright and had given them their share of the bribe money, com
pleting the deal and securing immunity from interference for
three of the building and loan associations that compose what is
known as the ''Big Four."' these three being the Phoenix, the
Renters and the Pacific States.
ONE LINK STILL REMAINS T XFORGED.
The other member of the "Big Four," the Continental, was
not included because, it was testified, the accused Senators de
manded $10,000 to stay proceedings against it, and its officers re
fused to contribute a dollar for protection, save what it cost them
as their share toward the payment of detectives that carried
through the plan to trap the men that now stand before the bar
of the Senate accused of felony. The link that remains to be
forged in the chain of evidence relates to the passage of the
marked bills, which it was testified to-night were given to Ety
mons, Wright, Bunkers and Freeh in payment for their good of
fices. If the prosecution has witnesses to testify that the accused
have passed marked bills it gave no intimation of the fact to
night. This alone will complete a legal case, it is said, for no
matter how positive the evidence that Joseph S. Jordan received
the money and was seen handing what appeared to be the envel
opes in which the marked bills were placed to at least two of the
accused Senators, the legal doubt will always remain- as to whether
Jurdan honestly carried out his part of the dishonest conspiracy.
REMARKABLE GATHERING AT HEARING.
The trial to-night drew a crowd to the Senate chamber, that
was remarkable for its personnel and significant as evidencing
how far the slush of scandal has spread. Politicians that have
been hurt, lawyers that have been retained to defend the accused
and to prosecute them, citizen* actuated by curiosity, detectives
and bodyguards earning their fees, editors with policies to
maintain and with axes to grind, women, some fearful of the
outcome, others looking for entertainment, gathered from the
four corners of the State to watch the battle rage.
Mayor Schmitz of San Francisco, whose reputation has been
assailed in connection with the scandal, arrived early to give if
called upon, his testimony in denial of the intimation that he
stood ready to award Senator Bunkers in return for his loyalty to
the cause of the San Francisco Examiner in its efforts to undo
lington Dodge.
The prosecution docs not allege, however, that Mayor
Schmitz stood ready to thus reward Bunkers. It simply states

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â The great
drama of the legislative sessionâ the
trial before the bar of the Senate on
charges of bribery of four of its mem
bers, Bunkers, Emmons, French and
Wrightâ opened to-night. Direct tes
timony, of which it seems there can be
no refutation, bars the way to exon
eration for a,t least Joseph S. Jordan,
secretary of the San Francisco Senato
rial delegation and legislative repre
sentative of the San Franeteco/Even
ing Post. Absolute evidence that the
accused Senators took the money they
are charged with having taken is lack
ing, however, in the fact that when
the investigation closed to-night no
one had been placed on the stand to
testify that they had received from
either of the accused any of the
marked bills it is claimed were handed
them, though a detective testified pos
itively that he saw Joseph S. Jordan,
the go-between, hand envelopes con
taining $350 to both Emmons and Bun
kers and that later they were told by
Jordan that he had paid French and
Wright, Jordan having failed to keep
an engagement with the ' detectives
they made in hopes they would seethe
money pass. This detective is George
N. Tichenor, formerly of Pinkertons.
and now Inspector of the Continental
Building and Loan Association. An
other detective, as yet unnamed, will
testify on the same line to-morrow
evening.
Promptly at 8 o'clock Senator Bel
shaw, chairman of the investigating
committee, called for order. He said
that no disturbance would be tolerated

and those that violated the injunction ]
would be ejected from the chamber.
He then asked if William Corbin was
present, and being answered in the
affirmative directed that the hearing;
proceed. The trial opened with a warm
discussion between members of the
committee and counsel as to whether
Corbin should be again required to f.
swear to his affidavit of accusation.
There was objection to this by Corbin's
attorneys, as they pointed out that he
had already sworn to the statement
and would give his testimony under
oath when the time came.
COPELAKD OBJECTS.
Attorney Copland, representing Sen
ator Emmons, was insistent that the
affidavit should be again sworn to.
"Because," he said, "it is doubtful
whether a man can be prosecuted for
perjury on an affidavit sworn td before
a notary only."
Gopeland was informed that he need
have no fear on that score, that Cor
bin would testify under oath to the
facts contained in the affidavit, and
more, too, before the hearing was at
an end. Copeland then said that he
would like to know whether the hear
ing was going to proceed on strictly
legal lines or if the committee would
be liberal in hearing the case. He
would rather it would proceed on lib
eral lines., He was not looking for
traps, he said, but would like to have
it as liberal as possible that every
phase of the charges might .be
brought to light. He was assured that
the hearing would be on liberal lines
and Chairman Belshaw then ordered
that the witnesses be called. McNab
asked the right to call one witness be
fore Corbin took the stand, stating
that this witness was greatly Incon
venienced by being called here. This
raised another controversy, but the
chair finally ruled that the prosecution

case as it saw fit.

Belshaw.
Clarence Grange, manager of the
Phoenix Savings Building: and Loan
Association of San Francisco, who re
sides at 2315 Broadway in that city,
took *he stand.
GRANGE TELJjS STORY.
Grange first testified that he had
occupied his present position five
years and then proceeded, in answer
to questions, to tell his story.
"A week ago last Saturday," said
Grange, "Joseph S. Jordan, whom I
had known for some time, called on
me at my residence in San Francisco.
He called to see m% as an emissary
of certain members of the Senate
Committee on Commissions and Re
trenchments. His purpose was to se
cure money for these men, which, he
said, was necessary to stay an investi
gation of the corporation of which I
am manager, and also the investigation
of other corporations of the same
character. He told me hell was pop
ping In Sacramento; that the Senate
Committee on Commissions and Re
trenchments had six subpenas out di
rected against the 'Big Four.' so
called, and that the committee pur
posed holding .in investigation the
following Tuesday in which these
companies would* b,e aimed at.
"He told me that the committee
was open for business and wanted to
know if I wanted to do business with
them, and if I would pay for Immu
nity, I told him that I didn't care
for the investigation; that I had
nothing to conceal and that I would
take no steps looking toward staying
the investigation or receiving a favor
able report, if such investigation was
held, unless the managers of the
other companies agreed that such a
course was advisable, and that before
I \;ould even \nv the question before
thpm I must have a definite proposi
tion. ] told him that in any event
nothing could be done by the follow
ing Tuesday; that the time was too
short.
ASKS FOR AX OFFER.
"He said he would see Bunkers and
French and let me know the following
day (Sunday) what they had to say.
I remained in all day, awaiting him.
and at 2 o'clock he arrived. He wanted
to know what proposition I would of
fer, and I told him that I had none to
offer, and that he must brinsr me one.
He told me that immunity could be
purchased reasonably for three of the
companies included in the "Big Four,'
but that the Continental would have
to pay big money for protection. This,
he said, was on account of the Exam
iner, which would raise a disturbance

If the corporation was let down easy,
and the members of the committee
thought they should be well paid for
facing what was sure to follow.
"He said that French and Bunkers
were waiting for him at Eighth and
Market streets and that he would go
to see them. He returned at 5 p. m.
and said the three companies could fix
it for $2000. a fourth of which was to
go to- each Senator. This sum. he said,
however, was outside of his commis
sion. He said he wanted 1250. He said
the four members of the committee that
would stand in demanded $10,000 to pro
tect the Continental, outside of his
commission. He said the four Senators
would not move a peg for less than
$2500 each, as they were sure to be
dogrged by the Examiner. Emmons
had told him, he said, further, that he
expected evidence would be furnished
by the Examiner as a result of which
warrants could be issued for the ar
rest of McNab and Washington Dodge
for compounding a felony.

"Have you met Jordan since thÂ«
23d?" inquired Attorney Copeland.
"I met him in this city last Friday
at the Capitol Hntei." answered the
witness. "T asked him how things
were and he said there was trouble.
He said that Bunkers only got $300
in his parkaice; that he had seen the

unexplained circumstances $50 had
been extracted from the envelope. He
said that Bunkers demanded the
money, but I told him to wait a week.

the Bulletin. I again told him no and
he hung up."
"Did he present any documents show
ing that he was authorized to collect
this money for the Senators named?"
Biid Chairman Belshaw.
"No, he did not," answered the wit
ness. "He simply claimed to repre
eent the Senators, but he proved to me
conclusively that he did represent
them when he told me in answer to my
statement that 1 would not be ready
for him on Tuesday that the proposed
investigation would be continued un
til Wednesday. And it was continued,
as he said it would be. He told me
that I would not have to come up un
less I desired ana that if I did come up
I could write my own report as to the
condition of the corporation I repre
sented. The 'Big Four' 1 have men
tioned .here includes â â â¢- Continental,
the Renters, the Pacific States and the
Phoenix." â¢
The direct examination concluded at
this point and Attorney Copeland took
up the cross-examination of the wit
ness.
"Have you known Jordan for some
tin.c," he asked.
'â¢Yes." answered the witness. "I have
known him for about two years. He
has solicited advertisements from me
and on other occasions has written ad
vertisements for me. I do not know
either Senators Emmons, French,
Bunkers or Wright." >'- :
MoN AH IX THE PLOT.
"Why did you go to see Mr. McXab
about this case?" , -'land asked.
"I went to see him because he Is my
counsel. We discussed the matter and
I asked him his opinion of the matter.
He expressed it in no uncertain terms
and then told me I must be sure when
the money was paid that witnesses
would be present who could later tes
tify to the fact, that we mU'ht catch
all the rascals." ' â¢
"Did McXab tell you how he had
been used by the Examiner and that
he was anxious to get back."
"All he said regarding this w is that
he did not care what the Examiner
did in reference to the matter. He did
not express his opinion in any way
regarding how the Examiner had
treated him. We simply discussed the
best means to get this money into" the
hands of the Senators in the presence
of witnesses, and I suggested that
Oeorgre X. Tichenor, who - ! had much
experience with the Plnkertons, be em
ployed to do that work. McXab said
it was the very thing. He would at
tend to the details, he said, and with
this I stepped out and had nothing
further to do with the case except to
hand the.-, money to the man he in
dicated." "rf'v ';;*.*:' - >Â».
"Did Jordan name the Senators he
claimed demanded this money?"
'"Yes, he said that Emmons, Bunkers i
and French were certain, but he was j
not sure of the fourth man. 1 fell in j
with his idea because I have been In
business' fifteen years and have never
paid any money for protection because i
I did not need It. , I made up my i
mind that if any man ever tried to
blackmail me 1 wpuld I? y a trap for
him and corner him if I ould." I
"Why, then, did you deem it neces
sary to take the action you did; what
reason had you for listening to Jor- j
dan; what did he have that furnished
a basis for his demand?''
THREATS ARE USED.
"There is a bill before the Assembly. I
No. 75, that I consider bad. This bill
if i>assed would do all of our com; ' -
nies great injury. I heard that it I
opposed this bill it would be at- j
tacked in the Examiner and that ad
vertisements would be printed to in
jure my business."
'Who threatened you?"
"Frank Otis, president of the -Local
League, a combine of the smaller com- â 
panics, told me that if 1 opposed this j
bill I might expect to be investigated
by a legislative committee and lif nee- j
essary advertisements and attacks by
the papers would be directed against
me. Otis is an attorney of San Fran
cisco and is antagonistic to our inter- j
ests because those he represents are \
losing, while we are gaining all the j
time. They are trying to legislate us
out of business."
"I gee," said Copeland. "this is a |
quarrel between these companies and'
1 would like to ask where the people
â  come in?"
"I am taking the side of the people |
in this answered Grange. * "Yes, I !
know the building and loan associa
tions of the State have this habit," In
terjected Copeland sarcastically.
Continuing Grange testified as fol
lows: â¢
"When Jordan first brought his de
mand to me I thought it would be a
jeood plan to pay this money to him if ,
it would produce evidence of the guilt!
of any of the members of this Legis- \
lature. I had nothing to fear nor did
I lead Jordan to believe I had anything
to fear, though doubtless he was Im
pressed with the view that such must
have been the case. The last conversa- j
tion I had with Jordan was on January j
23. when he told me he had delivered I
the money to Bunkers, Emmons, !
French and Wright. He told me 'â 
Bunkers was $30 short. This meeting I
was in the Capitol Hotel In this city
in room 64. I telegraphed him to meet
me, having asked him to get together
some bills for me. I -wanted these bills
,that I might prepare an argument
when they came up."
DISCUSS MEAN'S USED. j
In answer to other questions carry- '
ing him back to the first days of the
negotiations with Jordan, Grange said:
"I tried to communicate with Mr.
McXab on trffe day Jordan first called
on me, but I did not get into communi
cation with him until the following

regarding the probable action he will
take before the investigation comes to
an end."
"You knew, did you not, that McNab
was interested in having these Sena
tors entrapped?" asked Copeland.
â  1 did not give this phase of the
question one thought berause 1 knew
that the case of the Continental would
be brought to a focus in other proceed
ings that were in course of prepara
tion."
Then you did not know that the
Continental was going to use your evi
dence of corruption for its own bene
fit?"
No. I did not."
"Y<>u did not know the Continental
was coming here to make a fight and
base the same on your thunder?"
"No, I did not give this snd of the
case much consideration, but I can say
that I did not care that it did- take my
thunder and use it as it has."
Afked by Copeland if he had seen
Jordan since the alleged bribing trans
actions, Gra: ge said he had. "On the
train to-day." he said.
"What conversation did you have
with him?" was the next question.
"I didn t speak to him," replied
Grange.
"Aren't you friends now?"
"Well. I don't know," was the reply.
Asked if he didn't express surprise
when Jordan came to him with such
a nefarious proposition, the witness
said, "Why. not at all."
Who threatened you with the wrath
of the Examiner?" asked Belshaw.
"Mr. Mallett came to me and Baid
the Examiner probably would make an
attack on my company if I api>eared
before the Assembly committee."
"Did he speak authoritatively?"
( "I don't know." i ,
Grange said that Frank Otife of the
Jocal league of building and loan asso
ciations of San Francisco had also
threatened him with dire consequence
if he fought the Assembly bill.
Grange said Perine secured the bills
and gold notes to be given the Senators
at the banks. The witness knew noth
ing about the marking of them. In
reply to Cator's expression of surprise
at this he said he supposed the man
chosen to deliver them was shrewd
enough to mark them properly.
-McXAB OX STAND.
Gavin McNab was called, and the an
nouncement of his name naturally
caused a murmur to arise among the
auditors. He was accompanied by
Gould. He told of Grange ringing him
up and telling him he wanted to see
him about Jordan's proposition. Mc-
Nab met Grange at the attorney's of
fice and the agent told him how Jor
dan had come to him purporting to
represent the four Senators, and had
made the proposition for bribe money.
Jordan had talked with astonishing
freedom. Grange told McNab, the basis
of the offer being that for a certain
sum the committee would let such as
sociations as wf-re investigated, with
the exception of the Continental tile
any reports they wished. For the Con
tinental $10,000 was demanded, with a
fee of $2000 for Jordan.
The letter said, so Grange told Mc-
Nab, that the Contipental was under
the ban of the Examiner and that Em
mons had told him hr- had an arrange
ment to get some matter against that
association that the attack could be
hung on and then accuse Washington
Dodge and the witness of compounding
a felony.
McNab at once asked Grange if he
was willing to collect some money to
be used in trapping the alleged black
mailers, and Grange said he was.
They then talked of a man to carry
out the plan of exposing the four Sena
tors spoken of by Jordan. Tichenor
wmm settled upon at once as the best
person for the work.
Extensive assistance was needed,"
continued McNab, "and being very
friendly with Mr. Older of the Bul
letin, 1 rang him up. I knew he was
at a reception being given that night
at James H. Barry's house in honor of
Arthur McEwen. Mr. Older consented
to meet me at his room at the Palace,
and we went there. He agreed to keep
In his office a record of the greenbacks

Corbin secured the consent of Tich
enor to lend his aid in the matter. He
told him he must not allow Jordan to
get the money and pay the Senators
without witnesses seeing the transac
tion. Corbin did not know the Renters
or the Proehix knew anything about it.
"There was a mistake made in the
number of Corbin's residence in Sacra
mento, and Tichenor telephoned he
could not find it. There also came a
telephone from Tichenor sayine the
party who was to pay the coin was on
a strike and demanded $250 instead of
$150 for himself, and that he would not
see any Senator until it came. Tich
enor also said Jondan was hfcvinjf
trouble with the Senators. Ont of
them wanted to take the money from
no one but Jordan, and one wanted to
take all of it. but the others did not

enor that if he could get evidence to

the money passed, to do so."
The witness produced the key that
had been given him by Tichenor as that
of Jordan's room. Jordan had given it
to the detective. It was Introduced in
evidence with a statement that it was
probably not the key to the room, but to
the door of the house where the room
was located.

that Dent H. Robert, managing editor of the Examiner, said
that Mayor Schmitz would supply the position when Bunkers
had proved his loyalty to the Examiner by gathering wrth its staff
at the ruins of the Continental, shattered by him and his asso
ciates on the Senate Committee on Commissions and Retrench
ment.
GREAT ARRAY OF LEGAL TALENT.
William Corbin, the prosecutor, was accompanied by Attar
neys Gavin McXab, chief counsel for the Continental, and Frank
H. Gould. J. L. Copeland and Thomas V. Cator were present in
the interest of Emmons. Wright was represented by Attorneys
J. E. Alexander of San Francisco and F. C. Jacobs of San Jose.
â French and Bunkers decided to see how things were before figur
ing on counsel fees, and they were present in person to watch
events. Wright was also present, but he settled back and permit
ted his counsel to do the worrying for him. Emmons remained
in the corridor the greater part of the time, discussing the situation
with friends. District Attorney Seymour of Sacramento was also
present among the interested spectators.
President Anderson was in his seat and beside him were Gen
eral Dickinson on the left and Mayor Schmitz on the right. All
evidenced unusual interest in the battle spread out be
fore them, and their eyes sparkled in contemplation of the fray
when Attorney Gavin McXab and Managing Editor Robert of
the Examiner clashed. These two arch enemies tried to have it
out verbally before the committee, but tfie chairman suppressed
them as they were engaged in hurling unpleasant reminders at
each other, the Morgue and ballot-box stuffing being subjects

Mills building.
OLDER GIVES TESTIMONY.
Fremont Older, managing editor of
the Bulletin, was called. He said that
he was acquainted with McNab, and
told about the attorney ringing him up
at the home of Editor Barry and the
meeting at the Palace.
The witness said he received the
paper money in the case and that he
and Crothers, owner of the Bulletin,
signed each of the slips describfng the
bills and gold notes given to Tichenor
to be used in Sacramento.
The hour was growing late and

was present, it he wanted to make a
statement so he could go bac' to San

"No, Mr. McNab, I'm surely not,"
said Robert.
as if he had never seen him before in

he is."
"Yes, it's good to be acquainted,"
replied Robert-
ROBERT SHOWS EMOTIOX.
Robert took the witness chair and
these portions of the affidavit filed by
Corbin that referred to himself arid
the Examiner were read. With emo
tion he pronounced them untrue.
"Every statement about the Ex
aminer in the affidavit is absolutely
false," said Robert. "I know none of
the accused men. I never asked Mayor
Schmitz to give Mr. Bunkers a posi
tion, nor have I ever asked him to give
a position any one. I have not spoken
to Mr. Jordan in three years. I never
knew that such a committee as that on
Commissions and Retrenchment was to
be appointed.
"My entire knowledge of the inves
upMtion is that ten days or two weeks
ngo Mr. Murphy telephoned me that
Senator French had come to him and
said his committee was prepared to
investigate building and loan associa
tions. I then sent Mr. Myrtle to Sac
ramento to find out who was making
an investigation and he told Senator
French that all the information and
figures he had obtained were at the
disposal of the committee."
Fr?d Myrtle, formerly a reporter on
the Examiner, was employed as an ex
pert to look into the books of the Con
tinental Building and Loan Associa
tion.
"I want the books of the Examiner
produced to show the amount of money
it paid the HassÂ»ll Auditing Company
tp examine the books of the Continen
tal Building and Loan Association, and
how much it spent in its attempt to
ruin the Continental," said McNab,
HEATED WORDS FOLLOW.
"I'll tell you now," Baid Robert, "if
you desire. I can't see though what
i this has to do with the investigation of
â¢ this bribery charge." .
"In what manner would these facts
be connected with the examination?"
asked Simpson.
"I'll connect it with the investiga
tion," said McNab. "I want to cross
question Mr. Robert after we have ex
amined Washington Dodge."
"How do you propose to connect the
Examiner with the building and loan
investigation?" asked Simpson.
"I'll show motive," said McNab,
whose voice was beginning to have
an angry ring, and he rose and tow*
ered over Robert, who retained his
seat. "I'll show part motive and part
conspiracy. This witness admits that
French communicated with him
through Murphy. For weeks his pa
per had the Hassel! Audit Company
at work in an attempt to Injure Dr.
Dodge and ruin the stockholders Âof
the Continental. Thefr own man said
the books of the concern were sound
and the assets there. After a subpena
Mr. Myrtle and these others prepared
a list of books and papers to be pre
sented to this Committee on Commis
sions and Retrenchment. The com
mittee was simply a tool in the hands
of this man for the purposes of perse
cution."
McNab's voice had assumed a dra
matic tenor and the editor he was ac
cusing began to show still gTeater evi
dence of emotion., The throng was
straining ears and eyes, wondering
what would be the Â«nd.
McXAB AND ROBERT CLASH.
"You don't mean to say that you
can, in any way, connect the Examiner
with this bribery charge?" asked Simp
son of the attorney.
"I firmly believe that they paid Sen
ator Emmons," said McNab, "thouy
cannot prove it, and" â
"No, you can't prove it. Mr. McNa>
said Robert, breaking his silence. -You
know you can't prove it, and you know
it isn't true."
"Well. I don't know," said McNab.
"You have been guilty of worse things
âballot-box stuffing ana "
"We were never mixed up in any
case at the Morgue!" exclaimed Robert,
his anger rising to a pitch equal to that
of MeXab.
"Let me tell you something that they
did in a Morgue case, gentlemen!" cried
McN&b. "I'll tell "
The storm was stilled by Chairman
Belshaw's gavel and McNab- was sent
to his chair before any more of the
gruesome mysteries of the Morgue
could be brought to light.
"I am perfectly willing now to tell
all about the story of the investigation
of the Continental," said Robert again
when th? storm ha.d ceased. "Every
thing is at the service of you gentle
men."
"That is the work of another commit
tee," said Chairman Belshaw. "This
one has troubles of its own."
JORDAN DEMANDS $250.
Tichenor told about coming to Sac
ramento with the paper money to be
distributed. When he met Jordan the
first question the latter asked was:
"Have you got my money?" The wit
ness replied that he had $150 for him
and Jordan Insisted that he must have
$-50. The.i they were at Jordan's
room at 1116 Seventh street, and Jor
dan said be would go to the Senate
and bring down the men who were
to be bought. Eihmons, he said,
wanted to get all the money and pay
the others, but the others objected.
The arrangement was finally made
whereby Jordan was to hand the money
to ihe men on the street, where Tich
enor could see the transaction without
the knowledge of those receiving it.
Another man working with Tichenor
also saw it, unknown to Jordan. Em
mons and Bunkers were paid on the
street in view of Tichenor and his con
federate, but there was a different tale
to tell regarding Wright and French,
the witness said. Jordan said they
were at the committee meeting at 817
Tenth street, and that if Tichenor, or
"Bill" Newell, as he knew him, would
wait outside, he would go in and bring
them out one at a time or pay them
if they refused to come out.
Then Jordan told the detective he
would meet him at the Golden Eajrle at
10 o'clock and see what could be done.
He appeared at the hotel at 11:25 and
said he had understood the place of
meeting to have been in front of 817
X Btreet. He had met French and
Wright there when they came out. he
said, and paid them their $350 each.
Jordan said he had been walking ud
and down in front of 817 X street for
an hour ; waiting for "Newell."
Tichenor said that each of the green
backs and gold notes was marked so
that it could be identified again.
Jordan wanted the other $100 that
was due him and the witness says he
went down to the Southern Pacific sta
tion, w.here he met Russell of the Con-*
tlnental and was handed by him a $100
gold note also marked. This he handed
to Jordan.
Mayor Schmitz asked the privilege,
as the session was about to end, of
making a statement in reply .to the al
legations concerning him in the Cor
bin affidavit. He said he had never
agreed with Robert or any one else to
appoint Bunkers to a position.
The committee adjourned its hearing
until to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.
JORDAN ARRESTED.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 1. â At the in
stigation of District Attorney Seymour
of Sacramento County Joseph S. Jor
dan was taken Into custody last night
as he left the train arriving from San
Francisco and charged with bribery.
Jordan was taken into custody by
Sheriff O'Neil. He is now in charge
of the Sheriff, -who holds him on the
suspicion that he has committed
felony. The Sheriff states that a
formal complaint probably will be Is
sued to-morrow.
An effort was made at an early hour
this (Wednesday) morning to have
Judge Hart of the Superior Court, fix
Jordan's bail, but the Judge stated
that he refused to interfere with a
case that is now before the State
Senate.
Jordan denied the Tumor that _ an

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â Reaction
after the excitement of yesterday has
set in and this morning when the Sen
ate convened it proceeded to its work
in a subdued, unostentatious manner.
After the prayer of the chaplain had
been concluded, Ralston, to whom had
been delegated the work of preparing
a resolution providing for the continu
ance of the investigation of the Conti
nental Building and Loan Association
of San Francisco, announced that he
was ready to report. He was directed
to do so and filed the following reso
lution for the consideration of his col
leagues:
Whereas, Under and by virtue of the laws
of' the State of California, generally known
as the law of orrporationsj there ha* been or-
K&nized and ineorjjorated certain corporations
commonly designated as building and loan as
sociations. Investment companies and security
companies; and
Whereas, It has come to tha attention of
this Legislature that there ia existing in the
State of California certain of said corporations
engaged In what Is generally called building
and loan business and investment securities
which proniice large returns to Investors and
against which corporations there has been
made specific charges of unfair methods of
deaiing with their stockholders, and it is pub
licly asserted by a large number of citizen*
of California that said corporations are carry
ing on a business which results In a detriment
to those who deal with them, and do not con
duct a legitimate business, and that the cor
poration laws of the State are Inefficient and
do not In specific terms define the duties and
prescribe the terms of contracts which said
o-orpo rat ions may makÂ«; and
Whereas, It Is necessary and proper that
this body should be fully advised of the na
ture and extent of the business of the corpo
rations herein referred to In order that It may
v legislate upon that subject and to
onart laws which will control the dealings of
Bald corporations and prescribe proper penal
ties for tha violation of such laws; and
Wh'-reas, This Senate ha 3 In contemplation
the enactment of laws that will correct said
evils and prescribe proper penalties for the
violation of such laws and prevent the con
summation of any injustice or wrong done to
persons who deal with 6uch corporatiens;
therefore be It
Resolved. That a special committee of five
members of the Senate be appointed for the
purpose of Investigating- the methods of any
buiMlns and loan association. . Investment
company, security ' company lor other corpora
tion doing business in the State of California,
and that saM committee be and It is hereby
authorized and .empowered- to meet at 'such
time and place as it I may deem fit and proper,
during this session of the. legislature, and
that It have and Is hereby given full power to
examine . the safes, books, papers a.i& docu
ment* belonging: to any such corpora, n. the
affairs of which It. may desire' to ' Investigate,
and that it has full power, to compel the pro
duction of all keys, books, > papers and docu
ments by summary process t upon application
therefor to any court of ; record or Judge there
of in the county wherein such , corporation has
its said keys, books, * papers and documents.
That said committee " be . empowered to compel
the attendance of any and all witnesses resid
ing in th,ls State, and that said committee re
port the result of' Us Investigation to this Sen
ate with all . possible 'dispatch.
RESOLUTION ADOPTED.
Senator Curtin objected to the form
of the resolution, saying that it con
tained the same faults as those that
resulted in the discharge of Corbin
after he had been arrested upon order
of the Senate for violation of its prb
cess. The Continental Building and
Loan Association should have been
specifically named in the resolution, he
said, and he doubted whether the reso
lution as it stood would withstand the
assault of the respondent corporations.
He did not wish to be understood as
being opposed, to the investigation of
thp Continental or any other building
and loan association, notwithstanding
his usual antipathy to special commit
tee investigations, but he would like to
see this committee start right, that it
might not receive another setback.
Ralston said, however, that he had
looked carefully into the law and was
confident that the naming in the reso
lution of a specific line of corporations
to be Investigated was sufficient; that
it was not necessary that the Conti
nental be named, as It fell under the
heading of the character of corpora
tions to be investigated. This ended
the discussion and the resolution was
adopted. The committee will be ap
pointed to-morrow.
During the discussion of the resolu
tion Senator Emmons sat In the lobby,
the' picture of despair. He said that
though he had withdrawn his motion
that he be permitted to remain away
from the .sessions of the Senate during
the pendency of the investigation of
the charges against him, his withdraw
al of the motion being at the Instance
of friends on the floor, he did not feel
that he had a right In the chamber un
til he had been exonerated and hence,
after responding to roll call each day,
he would take no further part in the
proceedings until after the conclusion
of the investigation, and then only If
the report was favorable to him, but he
had no fears that it would not be.
Senators French and Wright sat
throughout the session, but took no ac
tive part In the proceedings, as has
been their custom. Bunkers was not
present and all sorts of rumors were
afloat as to his whereabouts and in
tents, one being that he had decided to
tell all he knew regf rding the alleged
culpability of himself and associates.
All of these rumors lack confirmation,
however, and are but the natural re
sult of Bunkers' unexplained absence
from his place in the upper house.
ARIZONA'S MEMORIAL.
The Legislature of California has
been by the House of
Representatives of Arizona, sitting in
its twenty- third legislative session, to
instruct or request the Senators and
Congressmen of this State to lend all
of their effort to defeat the measure
now pending at Washington to merge
Arizona and New Mexico into one
State.
Senator Leavitt astonished his col
leagues this morning by Increasing the
list of attaches of the Senate by two.
He introduced a resolution providing
for the appointment of Mrs. R. Schmit
and J. A. Galland as assistant engross
ing and enrolling clerks at salaries of
$5 a day. The resolution passed with
out a dissenting voice, which added
evten more to the astonishment of
Leavitt's colleagues, each one of them
having expected the other to offer at
least a slight word of protest.
Ward's bill establishing a Board of
State Harbor Commissioners for the
bay of San Diego was finally passed
and sent to the Assembly. Similar ac
tion was taken on Wolfe's bill empow
ering the State Harbor Commissioners
to insure against loss by fire the prop
erty of the State located on the water
front at San Francisco.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â The Senate
bill providing for the lowering by the
Government of the Klarrath. and other
lakes in Northern California for pur
poses of irrigation passed the lower
house this morning and is now ready
for the Covernor. When the measure
was reached on the file Assemblyman
Coyle read letters and telegrams from
Washington s.tating that its immediate
passage was necessary for the welfare
of California'a irrigation interests.
The Committee on Ways and
Constitutional Amendments (Houser
chairman) reported against the adop
tion of constitutional amendment 15,
by Anthony, providing for the "recall
of public officials in the State; No. s,

homes t from taxation, and No. 5, by
Jones of San Francisco, similarly ex
empting the Cogswell Polytechnic
School of San Francisco.
Atkinson's bill making Saturday aft
ernoon a half-holiday was passed with
Drew's amendment that it should be
in effect only in San Francisco, Los
Angeles and Alameda.
Houser's bill relative to the embez
zlement of public moneys, but which
also contains a clause that will permit
of the lending of city and county
moneys to banks by taking away the
penalty therefor, was passed after' a
fight. It is an important measure, as
at present millions of dollars of public
money is kept out of circulation.
Assemblyman Cleveland of Santa
Cruz presented a bill this morning
making it a felony punishable by re
moval from office for any Sheriff. Chief
of Police or District Attorney to fail in
the prosecution of any person violating
a statute of the State when their at
tention is called to such violation or
when they have cause to believe it ex
ists. It is said the measure is framed
to reach affairs in San Francisco, with
Chief of Police Wittman as the par
ticular object of its aim. If it becomes
a law any person who calls the atten
tion of any of the officers named to a
violation of a statute may secure the
arrest of that officer upon the latter's
failing to act upon the information.
Slaven introduced a bill providing
that all contracts for the sale of stock

PROPOSED : AMENDMENT
Change in Charter Provi

Constitution Is Intended
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« C*ll.
SACRAMENT* >. Jan. 31.â That furth-r
protection may be given the civil â Â»
vice employes of San Francisco. Sena
tor E. I. Wolf- is hurrying along his
proposed amendment to section 1* â (
article XX of thy- constitution of the
State. Franklin K. t.an-. who has
been in the city for the last few days,
is also taking an active interest on
behalf of the measure, saying that in
his opinion it is one that should r
th^ favorable eouldtrattoa of
Legislature and then ratification by the
people.
Section lti of arti< le XX provides as
follows: "When the term of any offlc-r
or commissioner is not provided for in
this constitution, th~ term pi such
officer or commissioner may be declared
by law; and, if not so declared, auch
officer or commissioner shall hold his
position as such officer or comijnssioner
during the pleasure of th^ authority
making the appointment; but in no
case shall such term exceed four
years." Regarding his proposed
amendment. Senator Wolfe said to
day:
Under section 12 of the charter of Ban Fran-
Cisco relating |to civil Â«ervlce employes every
officer and employ* of the city and county of
San Francisco Is entitled to a trial after writ
ten verified charge* , have- been filed before hÂ»
can be removed from office. At a meetins;
of the Board of Police Commissioners In San
Francisco, held In December last, e*-Commis
sioner - Huttcir raised the point that aÂ«ctlon
12 of the charter of San Francisco was un
constitutional In view of the fact that It was
In conflict with section 16 of article XX of
the constitution, for the reason that the t-rm
of office of the members of the Police De
partment was not declared by law and that
therefore under section '10 of 'article XX they
held at the pleasure of the appointing power,
hut In no case longer than four years, and
could be dismissed at the pleasure of the ap
pointing power.
The Supreme Court of the State of Califor
nia in 127 Cal. *Heporta and 132 Cal. Report*.
while declining to pass squarely upon the ..it
as to the constitutionality of section 12 of
the charter of San Francisco, has squinted at
Its unconstitutionally. . So that as the matter
now stands, the main feature of the civil 'serv
ice system which la fixed tenure of office dur
ing good behavior appears to be in danser.
The purpose of the proposed constitutional
amendment will remove this danger an<l in ex
press terms will exempt from the provisions of
section . 16 of article XX of the State consti
tution "any officer or employe of any munici
pality governed under a legally adopted char
tar and will provide further that the pro
visions of. such charter with reference to thÂ»
tenure of office or dismissal from offlcÂ» of
any such officer or employe shall control."
It 1* but fair to nay that.- notwithstanding
what the views of the 1 lice Commission may
bo upon the constitutionality of the provisions
of thÂ» -, charter which guarantee the. light of
trial â¢ to any officer, they would nevertheless
see that . such officer ' bad a trial before In
would fa* ilUmlaaed 1 . | But commissioners mlrht
be appointed who would hold different views.
and it ;Is In order that the most Important
feature of -.the civil service system may bÂ«
safeguarded, not only in San Francisco and
in the â  Police and Fire departments of that
city, but ' that civil service employes all over
the State may be protected this amendment la

the Associated Press at the Duke's pal
ace in the Quay de la Cour. The corre
spondent was received in the Grand
Duke's private study.
The Grand Duke is a man of perhaps
65 years, a veteran in appearance as
â well as in fact, for he won his spurs
and the cross of St. George twenty-five
ye^rs ago in the plains before Plevna,
lie is. big framed and dark visaged and
has iron gray hair and resembles more
his brother Alevander 111 than his

features soften as he talks, lending
to hÂ«s countenance a charm suggesting
the singularly gentle side to his nature,
which makes him beloved in his home
and among his family and friends.
When the correspondent mentioned
that the newspapers abroad had made
many statements regarding the events
of January 22, the Grand Duke replied:

in various parts of this city yesterday.
The First Aid c society has suspended
operations, telephonic communication
is interrupted and the conditions
throughout Warsaw are such that It
has been impossible thus far to ascer

The official account of the disturb
ances here on January 27 and 28, pub
lished in the Aboul Varshavikidnevnik,
details the commencement of the strike
at Sevam on January 27, with increas
ing disorder throughout the day.
The strikers went about compelling
workmen of other establishments to
ceasÂ« work, until 15,000 were out by
midday. Peaceable inhabitants became
panic stricken, fearing: famine, and pur
chased all the available food supplies
and besieged the bakeries. Rioting be
gnn at 3 o'clock, when there was an
almost general cessation of work
throughout the city; and owing to the
turbulent attitude - mobs parading
the streets the police were reinforced
by soldiers.
At 5 o'clock the strikers attacked the
police and gendarmes, sioning them.
Some shots were fired and the police
were compelled to return the fire by
which two strikers were killed.
Several other collisions occurred dur
ing the evening. The strikers looted
liquor stores and many other estab
lishments. Comparatively quiet was
restored, however, by 7 o'clock.
On the morning of January 28 bands
of strikers reappeared. The troops
showed a peaceful attitude, but dis
turbances began, professional thieves
and hoodlums Joining the ranks of the
paraders. The telephone kiosk's were
closed and all vehicles stopped. Many
carts were looted and lamps broken.
The crowds grew in numbers and the
disorder was so great that the military
was unable to cope with them. Houses
and shops were set on fire and pillaged
but finally the troops dispersed the
rioters by force of arms. The crowds
In some instances were well armed and
fired volleys at the troops. Barricades
were erected in the streets by strikers
who, thus protected, discharged fusil
lades at the soldiers in separate quar

for the troops to retaliate in kind.

JAPANESE ALERTNESS AGAIN FOILS PLANS OF
THE RUSSIAN COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
Surprise Attack
Upon Sandepas
a Failure.
Retreat Ordered
After Heavy
Losses.
MUKDEN, Jan. 31.â There is no
apparent connection between the
starting of the battle of January 26
and the domestic excitement in St.
Petersburg or the orders just issued
to abandon the planned advance
against the Japanese positions. The
effect of the trouble In Russia is as
yet imperceptible here. The facts are
not generally known. Officers pos
sessing information of occurrences at
home say that the disaffected are
probably using the present war as a
pretext for their periodical demon
strations.
The commander in chief's orders to
abandon the advance are reported to
state two reasons: First, the losses
sustained; second, (he failure >>f a
quick attack upon which the advance
depended.
Notwithstanding the order to cease*
a tenacious conflict continues in the
vicinity of Sanchiapu, a fortified out
post on the Japanese left, where it is
reported the Russians have taken the
outer works.
TSINKHETCHEN. Monday, Jan. 30.
The Japanese advance against the
Russian left turns out to have been
merely a demonstration. The Japan
ese fell back aa soon as the Russians
brought up reinforcements. The only
fighting or any consequence occurred
at Chonhal Pass at 3 o'clock oil the
morning of January 29. Two Japan
ese battalions tried to capture the vil
lage of Tingai. A bayonet encounter
ensued and the Japanese were driven
off. leaving thirty-nine dead and
eight wounded. The Russians lost
twelve killed and thirty-six wounded.
SHOT MEANT FOR CZAR.
ST. PETERSBURG., Feb. 1. â A sen
sational but unconfirmed report was
current last night that the commis
sion investigating the incident of Jan
uary v l 9 when, during the annual cere
mony of the blessing of the waters of
the Neva, the imperial family narrow
ly escaped death, has discovered that
it was a deliberate attempt at terror
ism and that the responsibility for the
insertion of grape in front of a salute
charge has been fixed upon Bogdanoff,
a private of the Seventh Battery of the
First Horse Artillery of the Guards.
Bogdanoff, it is said, is a former stu
dent and a member of a revolutionary
society.
GORRY NOT IN DANGER.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 31. â The
report that Maxim Gorky may be
hanged for high treason is without the
slightest foundation. Even his friends
declare the rumor absurd. The ex
pectation is that he will be released
when quiet is restored. He was a
member of the deputation of editors
and literary men who called upon
Witte, president of the Committee of
Ministers, on January 21, all of whom
were arrested, but several of whom
have already 'been released.
The only other charge against Gorky
is that he was a member of the com
mittee of three which was appointed
to collect funds for the strikers.
NEW VERSION OF SHOOTING.
LONDON, Feb. 1. â The correspond
ent of the Times at St. Petersburg
sends to his paper this morning a
curious story, which, he declares, he
obtained from unimpeachable author
ity. According to the correspondent,
when Grand Duke Vladimir was in
formed, on January 22, that Prince
Vassilchikoff, who was in command
of the troops in St. Petersburg, had
given orders to fire on the strikers,
Grand Duke Vladimir immediately or
dered that pacific measures be taken,
but the senior officer on the spot re
plied that he could not guarantee the
safety of the palace without using
force.
Not Attacking in Force.
BERLIN, Jan. 31. â The Russian
offensive movement, according to the
reports received by the German gen
eral staff from Mukden, has not been
completed, but continues to develop
and the result cannot be forecast.
These reports, which deal largely
with technical information, without
generalizations or description, affirm
that the Russians have not attacked
the Japanese left wing in force, but
that only skirmishes have taken place
on that wing and that the greater part
of four out of General Kuropatkin's
six army corps have so far taken part
in the demonstration.

Japanese Capture Steamship for Vladivostok
With Contraband From San Francisco.
TOKIO. Jan. 31. â The Japanese
yesterday captured off Hokkaido Isl
and. Northern Japan, the British
steamship Wyefield, laden with con
traband for Vladivostok.
The Wyefield is one of the best
known freighters on this coast. She
was owned and operated by the West
ern Fuel Company and until charter
ed by Harry J. Hart to carry contra
band to Vladivostok plied between
here and British Columbia coal ports.
She was commanded by Captain A.
Watson, who has a home in San Fran
cisco at 334 Fremont street. Captain
Watron has many friends here and is
well known in local shipping circles.
The captain's daughter is employed
as stenographer by the Lamson Con
solidated Store Service Company, in
the Claus Spreckels building. Miss
Watson is a true sailor's dÂ«ighter and,
while regretting her father's failure
to outwit the Japanese, is not worry
ing about his safety and expects him
to return home soon as a passenger
on one of the regular liners.
The Wyefield left here on Decem
ber 29. Like the other blockade run
ners, she cleared for Moji, Japan, but
no secret was made of her true des
tination. Her cargo, which was val
ued at $87,340 and was fully insured,
consisted of 66,000 centals of barley,
972 centals of oats and 1038 tons of
hay. It is said that neither owners
nor charterers, owing to th* insur
ance, will lose anything, eveTi if the
Japanese confiscate both vessel and
cargo. That this will be done is al
most certain. The greatest loss, it is
believed, will be to the Russian Gov
ernment.
The Wyefield was built in 1898 at
Port Glasgow and is a vessel of 2089
net tons register.
Another British steamship that the
Japanese probably will add to their
fleet of prizes is the Brinkburn, which
will leave here for Vladivostok to
morrow. The Brinkburn has a cargo
similar to that carried by the Wye
fleld. Her officers and crew are being
paid thÂ« regular coast wages, but it
is understood that in the event of run
ning the blockade successfully the of
ficers will receive a bonus equal to
100 per cent of their pay. The offi
cers are hopeful of success, but it is
the general opinion in the -local ship
ping world that before many weeks
the Brinkburn will be in commission
as the Brinkburn Maru.
BATTLE TO BE RESUMED.
Russians Continue to Hold Several
Captured Villages.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 31.â A tele
gram from Schiatun dated January
29 states that the Rusian losses from
January 25 to 29 were 10,000. but that
the percentage of the dead was small.
The Japanese losses were very heavy.
More than 300 Japanese were made
prisoners.
Although the Russians have aban
doned their advance, the latest official
dispatches received here indicate that
the fighting is not over. The Russians
continue to hold the captured villages.
The Japanese resumed the offensive on
January 29 and desperately assaulted
the Russians, but were everywhere re
pulsed.
General Kuropatkin. in dispatches
dated January 29 and January 30, re
ports that the Japanese losses in the
recent fighting were very heavy, many
being- bayoneted and sabered. The total
number of Japanese prisoners has not
been ascertained, but they already ex
ceed 300.
The Russian losses on January 28
among the advancfe posts were five
officers and fifty men.
General Kuropatkin says the Japan
ese offensive was indecisive and that
the Russians, who were in excellent
spirits, continue to occupy the villages
on their right flank, captured during
the recent fighting.
The Russians continue to successfully
bombard Sandepas, where many Japan
ese have been frozen to death.
SUFFERING OF THE WOUNDED.
Gangrene Induced by Exposure to the
Intense Cold.
MUKDEN. Monday. Jan. 30.â This
morning the Japanese advanced on
the Rusian left, drove in the cavalry
screen and bombarded the outlying
hills. The Russians moved up reinforce
ments, repulsed the Japanese and drove
them out of a village they had occu
pied.
Streams of wounded men are arriving
here from the right flank, including
Lieutenant General Mistchenko. who
is in excellent* spirits and is receiving
visitors. According to the official army
organ the wounded number 3500. The
cold is intense and the condition of
the wounded causes the greatest
anxiety, because the exposure ot their
wounds to the frost induces gangrene.
Preventive precautions have been
taken, but the men are suffering the
greatest pain.
Th? Japanese are taking good care
to see that the Rusian rank and file

disturbances in Russia. Lietters are
daily thrown within the ftusian lines,
declaring that all Russia is aflame with
riot and revolt, arguing that the sol
diers are shedding/their blood in vain
and calling upon them to surrender or
desert. The soldiers eagerly read and
discuss these communications, especi
ally accounts of the events in St.

hope is expressed on al! sides â¢
the army that the Rusian nation will
forego internal differences and not play
into the hands â¢of the Japanese.

on the Governor of Lower California
for the return of Dr. F. M. Staples

Barham was granted a divorce and
alimony to-day. Ex-Congressman
Barham is her father-in-law.
; Harriman group is increased by 15,843
miles.
It is pointed out that this transfer
of power by the Vanderbilts to the
Harriman -Rockefeller interests gives
that coterie, through affiliation with
Kuhn-Loeb and Gould interests, much
greater scope of power than appears
on the surface. Harriman already is
in combination with Kuhn, Loeb & Co.
and Rockefeller with the Gould mi
i terests. By some, a consolidation of
the holdings of the three combinations
is looked for. If this move come about
it would give the combination control
of nearly 100,000 miles of railroad of
the country.
OMAHA. Neb., Jan. 31.â D. H. Mof
fatt's interest in the Denver, North
western and Pacific, according to a re
port which reached here from Denver
to-day, has been sold to the Denver
and Rio Grande. The road will not be
built to Salt Lake, as intended. In
stead, it will be extended from Arrow
Head, the present terminus, to- Hot
Sulphur Springs, and a branch will be
constructed to Detsero, on the main
line of the Rio Grande, about twenty
miles east of Glenwood Springs. This
connection would give the Rib Grande
a much shorter line between Denver
and the Ogden gateway for transcon
tinental traffic.

Alone in the Ward, Commits
Suicide.
During the absence of the attend
i ant from the ward at St. Mary's Hos
pital, in which he was being treated,
Peter Foladara, an Italian laborer,

severed one of the arteries. Despite
the work of the physician, Dr. West,

; drinking heavily and It was thought
I by the doctors that this contributed to |
; his sickness. At the time of en- j
trance he was searched with the
purpose of preventing any attempt at
suicide, but Foladara succeeded m
concealing the razor-like pocket knife.
During the temporary absence of
Francois Guylett, another patient in
the Â£ame ward, Foladara slashed his
left arm. When Guylett returned he
found the Italian lying across the bed

â  To ' Whom It May Concern : After treat-
â  Ing with the best physicians and specialists
for the past Â»ix years I called on Dr.
Wong Htm. He made a simple examina-
tion by feeling the pulse and explained my
case fully. I asked him if he could cure
It. He said- yes. In from six to eight weeks,
which I can truthfully say he did. The
physicians here think him a wonder. - Any
one. writing me I will be only too glad and
thankful to answer. I can cheerfully rec-
ommend him In the very worst cases of
eczema, as my case was known to be one
of thÂ« . most â¢ stubborn on record. The
. X-ray was also a failure. I think Dr.
,VÂ»'oas Him one of the best doctors in t..e
United States and owe my future health to
him. Very truly. - ' -' 'â â¢â¢'

OF MURDER
DISCOVERED
At Least One ol

Poisoned.
Chicago Police Believe His
Victims Will Number
Twelve.
â¢ ; â¦
Supposed Eigamist Arrested in New

Man Wanted.
Bi*cla.: Dlepatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. ::i.â Poison has been
found in the stomach of Mrs. Wclker
Koch, the "next to the last" wife of
Johann Hoch. The partial result of
a chemical analyses was announced to
day. Coroner . Hoffman said he "now
considers the evidence of murder
against Koch to be strong. Chief of Po
lice O'NjeiJt, meantime, declared his be
lief that Ho< h. married to more than
a Ecore of women, has murdered at
Itast twelve of them. Coroner Hoff
man said: â¢
I talked with Dr. Lewke to-day, and
â OH had been found. The
ed result of the test is not
m . We can convict Hoch now."
The statement as to the twelve mur
ders was made by O'Neill in a â¢ letter
â uritten by him to Captain' James J.
L#anj?ar. of the detective bureau of New
York, in which* he requested the
Gotham Police Department to follow
*. clew given through an anonymous
letter received by Inspector Shippy
from a woman living at the Belvidere
Hotel, Eighteenth street and Fourth
avenue. New Yor^. In this letter it is
intimated that Hoch marired two New
York women, whom he abandoned.
A dispatch from Minneapolis says Dr. i
G. L. Hart, who on the night of* June '
IS, 1&05, tried to poison his bride of }
three days, Mrs. Mabel Loichman Hart, j
the actress, is supposed to be Hoch.
Descriptions ot the men tally, say the
police, and their general characteristics
are 'the. same.
The more the police and State's At
torney in Chicago attempt to unravel
the tangled mix-up in this case the
worse it becomes. â¢ An- attempt was
mad* to have Hoch indicted by the
Grand Jury to-day on chare-es of wife
abandonment and bigamy. Th* com
plainants were Mrs. Amelia Augusta
Fischer Hoch, Mrs. Anna Hendrickson
Koch and Ml Marie Goerk Hoch. It
w,-Â»s four.d, however, that in bigamy
cases a wife cannot testify against her
husban-J and that witnesses to the
marriage must be found before action
cat) be taken. As' the marriages â  took
place in many .different cities, there
vill be a long delay before witnesses
can be gathered to pive testimony
against Hoch sufficient to convict' hint.
Some details of the California end to
the history . of Hoch were . learned by
Police Inspector Wheeler to-day. Mrs.
Reichel. widow of a saloon-keeper,
cays that Hoch paid attentions to her
acrofcs the country from the Pacific
Coast. According to Inspector Wheeler.
Mrs. Reichel has known Hock as John
Hoepk for the last five years. When
shown a picture of the man to-day the
v.ojnan identified it as the man who
courted her in 1904. Three lettere,
dated at San. Francisco on February
12. 15 and 18, 1904, and written
in German, were given to the police
and translated. ! On the reverse side of
one of the envelopes was written:
If not delivered in ten days return
to John Hoeck. 1104 Clay street, , San
Francisco." The letters were written
by Hoch while in the California city
and speak of the writer's love for the
widow.
XEW YoRK, Jan. 31.â Johann Hoch
\\ ho was arrested here last
harged with bigamy and wife
lonment, after a search extending
Shoot the entire country, told the
oiEciais at Pottos Headquarters this
â norning that he was anxious to re- ;
"â apo at once.
Wh- r, Hoch was arraigned in the Po
â¢ -urt he was remanded back to
headquarters for forty-eight
hours. As the prisoner was leaving the
C'urtroom he said:
- I am the man wanted in Chi
biu they arc v mistaken as to the

CORPORATIONS
Passes a Bill Increasing
Fees of Stock Companies
in District of Columbia
BACKS .IP PRESIDENT
Measure Intended to Check
Overcapitalization by a
Graded Taxation System
"; WASHINGTON. Jan. 31. â The Sen
j ate to-day continued the consideration
of the joint statehood bill, with Kel
son as the principal speaker. A num
ber of bills were passed. Including ohÂ«
i largely Increasing the fees for cor
poration stock companies in the Dis
: trict of Columbia.
During the early hours of the ses
; sion to-day there were several echoes
j of the President's message of yester
â¢ day calling attention to abuses under
' the corporation laws of â  the District
jof Columbia. A bill intended to cor
! *rect the existing evil was introduced
by Senator Platt of Connecticut. The
; Senate passed a bill intended to re
1 strict the number of new corporations
j and removing the temptation to ex
: cesrive capitalization. This it is pro
posed to Jo by requiring the payment
I of a fee of 40 cents on every thous
i and dollars of capital stock of new
; corporations;
While this bill was under consider
! ation Bacon made inquiry as Vto
whether it was intended to ; cure the
evils relating to local corporations
; which had been pointed out by. th-Â»
President. Gallinger replied that it
would have a beneficial effect in regu
| lating corporations organized in j the
! future, but would not in any way reg
j ulate existing conditions. He added
i that some of the lawyers of the Sen-
I ate were giving attention to the prob
i lem as it relates to present corpora
. lions. - I
j Following. this colloquy Platt intro
jduced.his bill and on motion of Gal-
I linger it was referred to the Judiciary
j Committee. In presenting the meas
1 ure Plr.tt said that it did not entirely
suit his own views of the remedy.

LAST WARNING
TO BEEF TRUST
Must Heed Injunction or
United States Government
Will Institute Proceedings
NO FURTHER EVASIONS
President and Cabinet De- !
cide That "Dilly-Dallying" i
Shall Come to an End
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â 1t can be
said by authority that unless the cor
porations constituting the alleged
"beef trust" shall heed the injunction
made permanent yesterday by the de
cision of the Supreme Court of the
United States, the Government will in
stitute proceedings against the indi
vidual members of the corporations to
enforce the decision of the court. The
proceedings will be unÂ£er ihe criminal
law, if such can be instituted. The
minds of the President and members
of his Cabinet are made up fully on
the question. They have determined
that the -beef trust" shall obey the
law, and now that the highest court
in the United States has upheld the
hands of the Administration, it Is said
they will permit no further "dilly
dallying" \Mth rthe subject.
At t'i-day's Cabinet meeting 'the
President and Attorney General Moody
shared in the congratulations of the
members of the Cabinet on the result
of the "beef trust" case before the
Supreme Court. The President, who
made no attempt to conceal his satis
faction at the decision of the court,
united with the members of the Cabi
net in congratulating the Attorney
General. The subject was considered
briefly at. the meeting, but no definite
conclusion was reached as to what
action, if any, the Government would
take in the future, except the general
r?t termination to enforce the law as it
had been construed by the courts. The
President and the members of the
Cabinet regard the decision of the Su
pieme Court as a signal triumph of
IÂ«.W as they have viewed it and are
nrepared to carry it into effect abso
lutely.
AK^in the President emphasized his
interest In the arbitration treaties
pending before the Senate. He holds
that the opponents of the treaties are
proceeding on wrong premises in
maintaining that they may be used by
foreign countries as a basis for action
against certain Southern states in the
collection of old claims.
The action of Postmaster General
Wynne in notifying John G. Capers,
Republican National Committeeman for
South Carolina, that postmasters in that
Sif-.tc will be dismissed from the ser
vice if in the future they pay the ex
penses of delegates to political con
ventions, was approved by the Presi
dent and the Cabinet.

DESERTS FROM THE XAVY
TO JOIN CHILD BRIDE
George Pellom, Who Left the Pensa
cola at this Port, Surrenders
in St. LouLs.
ST. IjOUIS. Jan. Z\. â A quarrel with
his 16-year-old bride two years ago
led George Pellom, alias Parker, to en
list in the United States navy. Long
ing for her lei him to desert the train
ing ship Pensacola at San Francisco
on October 13. 1903, and rejoin her
In St. Louis. Fear of arrest led him
yesterday to surrender and the hope
of saving her name from connection
with the case led him twelve hours
lt.ter to deny that he was married.
To-day, however, when told that his
v ife had admitted all, he told his
story, piece by piece, still attempting
to shield her.
His marriage was the culmination
of a romance of a St. Louis school,
where he and his sweetheart were
rchoolmates. Pellom is being held
pending instruction's from San Fran
cicso.

INCIDENT OF CAMPAIGN
Diversion of Indian Funds
to Sectarian Schools Said
to Have President's Favor
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31. â Sensa
tional disclosures in relation -to the
alleged usp of Indian trust funds for
the support of sectarian schools were
made to-day by Senator Bard of Cal
ifornia in a statement to the Senate
Committee on Indian Affairs.
â¢ Senator Bard - addressed . the com
mittee after ; statements : had - been
made by S. M. Brosius, y agent of the
Indian Rights Association,; and Fran
cis E. Leupp]" Commissioner of ; ; In
dian ' 'Affairs. â¢ The r .. Senator .'said that
he had been visited by Dr. E. L.
S'-harf, an ; a sent ' for ml Roman Cath
olic mission society, : and asked to use
his influence with Republican â  mem
bers of Congress .look ing,; to forward
ing the interests of "V Catholics in g?t
tine: a diversion of Indian trust -funds
forithf: support of .Catholic* schools on
the reservations. : . lie? "quoted : Dr.
Scharf ; as / having * s ild 'â  that ,if ; the â¢ Re :
publicans would agree, to bring- about
the desired legislation the Catholics
would see ihat twenty Congr^ssionil
districts in which < the: .'.:. Republicans
were weak' were carried for the ' party.
Dr. Scharf was said to -have given the
names of the districts, together with
the number of Catholic voters, in each
and the names vof the -j priests who
'would look after the 11 'agreement I ' and
deliver the necessary votes to carry
the' district: \ ' .â¢: ";'.;'â  'â  '.._/';. ._/ '; â â¢ :â  -.;-.â  â ;â .
HAD NO FAITH IN SCHARF.
Senator Toller questioned Senator
Bard as to his construction of the of
fer of Dr. Scharf and received the re
ply:
"I thought, it purely political and at
the time placed little credence in it.'
Senator Teller said that if it was
proved that the statement of Dr.
Scharf was made in earnest there was
more cause to complain of the inter
ference of the Catholic church than ot
the Mormon church in the political
affairs of the country.
Bard said that be attached great
importance to the act of Congress of
June 7, 1897, which declared that it
was "the settled policy of the Govern
ment to hereafter make no appropri
ation whatever for education in any
sectarian school."
â¢ The 'Senator, said that he had been
informed that there was , no record at
the Interior Department of authority
for the diversion of these trust funds
to the support of ; Catholic missions,
but he had heard the statement made
that, it was done ,on an oral order,
which agents of the Indian Rights As
sociation allege to have been issued
by the President. Bard said that he
had been 1 informed that a very small
percentage of the Indians interested
gave * their consent oto^ the application
of "the funds for the support of sec
tarian . schools ] and . that -'a*/ large ma
jority â of the Indians were communi
.cants - ;in . \ the " various Protestant
churches ; located within " : the various
reservations. ' -.v ".*/. ;i.; i . : '';_' '[':'â 
DIVERSION" OF THE FUNDS.
The remarks of Senator Bard at
tracted attention to letters that had
been nut in the Record by Brosius.
Among these were a number from
priests in relation to the use of In
dian trust funds. Two of them alleged
tiiat the President was favorable to
the diversion of the funds for the pro
motion of the Catholic schools on the
reservations.
Brosius was questioned as to the date
of those letters and said that the cor
respondence he had "Tteen able to gel
hold of indicated that the interest of
the Catholic church developed during
the recent cainnaifrn.
The view of Commissioner Leupp
was substantially that, as he under
stood it, the contracts with the sec
tarian schools were made pursuant to
an order of the President, based on an
opinion from the Attorney General.
He said that the President doubtless
would welcome a judicial definition of
the status of Indian rights in such
matters! The, irrevocable settlerhent of
the question of the limitations of the
Government's authority as trustee "of
the Indian funds in the United States
treasury he said, was in the highest
degree desirable. He advocated legis
lation for the individualizing of the
funds of the several tribes, still keep
ing their control In the hands of the
Government, but opening a serrate
account with each Indian, who now is
entitled to an undivided interest in any
tribal fund. A particular objeef to be
gained by the Individualism of the
trust fund, hÂ« said, was to enable each
Indian to say for himself how the in
come from his share should be expend
ed in the education of hi? children.

MOTT WILL RUN FOR MAYORALTY
He Makes a Hot Canvass With Automobile and
Wins the Primary Election im Bio Majority.
OAKLAND, Jan. 31.â Frank K. Mott
will be the next Republican nominee
fur Mayor of Oakland, having carried
the First, Second. Fourth and Fifth
\vards in the Republican primary to
day, after one of the bitterest political
battles ever held in the city. His op
ponent, George E. Randolph, won in
the Third, and Seventh wards,
but these were not enough. Mott will
head the party ticket at the next mu
nici]ia: election.
The principal contents of the primary
were in the Fourth. Fifth and Sixth
wards, w here the opposing factions
worked actively until the polls closed.
The result was an extraordinarily
heavy vote. In many of the precincts
of the contested wards more than one
fourth of the registered vote had been
cast before 9 o'clock in the morning j
and in nearly every precinct almost j
all the voters registered came to the j
polls and cast their ballots.
There was no opposition to the Mott :
ticket in the First and Second wards, |
and Randolph controlled the Third. In !
the Fourth the Mott forces, headed by |
Dick Ayer and Edward Planer, were j
opposed by Councilman Edwin Ifeeae,
â¢x-Supervisor W. H. Church and Dr.!
If. L. Emerson. It was here that Mott
scored his most decisive victory, car- j
rying the ward by a majority of 224
votes.
â¢ The Fifth "Ward was the scene of a j
quirt but bitter contest. City Treas- ,
urer Felton Taylor, Councilman Ben
Pendleton. Senator G. R. Lukons and
J. Cal Ewing were handling Ran
dolph's fight In this ward, while Clar
ence Crowell, Charles D. Bates Jr. and
Ben Woolner were working hard for
the Mott ticket. I'ntil the close of the
polls both sides claimed the victory, but
when the ballots were counted it wan
found that Mott had carried the ward
by a majority of 156 votes.
The Sixth Ward was the b&Ulepround
of the hottest fight of the primary.
"With the opposing forces headed re
spective! y by ML J. Kelly for Mott and
Councilman W. J. Baccus for Ran
dolph. Allied with Kelly were Bert
H> instead. Eddie J. Smith, Frank Pe
rata and a score of others, while J. J.
McElroy, Harry Borchert, Assembly
man Phil If. Walsh, Frank Barn^t and
Dan Doodjr were working for the Bac
cup-Randolph ticket.
The Seventh Ward was also the
scene of a vigorous battle of ballots,
with Jud^f Henry A. Melvin. County
| Cierk ink Cook. Supervisor H. D.
j Rowe and Councilman Robert Aitken
leading the Randolph force?. Opposed
to them wen* C- uncilman J. T. Wal
lace and R. H. Chamberlain, with an
I able corps of lieutenants at each poll
: ins place. It was generally concfeued
that the Randolph ticket would carry
the ward, and there was little surprise
expressed when the t unt of the bal
! lots 6howed that Randolph had won by
: a majority of 315 votes.
The result of the primary means the
nomination of Frank K. Mott for May
or, Abe P. Leach for City Attorney and
FrÂ«d< rick C. Turner for <"ity Engineer.
Mr. Mott introduced an example of
up-to-date politics to-day by ih<-- use
of a handsome automobile, in which a
large number of voters were brought
to the polls.
The greatest surprise of the election
was. in the result of the vote at the
poll at Fourteenth and Webster streets.
This is Fejton Taylor's home precinct,
and the Randolph forces predicted that
; the Taylor-Pendleton ticket would car-:
ry three to one. Mott carried this pre
cinct by a majority of thirteen votes.

DKATII BY KLECTROCUTIOX
His Horse Runs .-'Against a Dangling
Â Live Wire and 'Is Instantly :
Killed.
OAKLAND, Jan. 81.â Giving no
heed to the warning cries of bystand
ers who saw his danger, P. Daniel, a
delivery clerk employed by the A. G.
Newhall Company, drove his horse
into the dangling end of a live wire
at Twentieth and Adeline streets to
day, the animal being instantly killed
and the driver narrowly escaping the
same fatr. The wire which caused
the trouble was a broken telephone
line which, In falling, dropped across
the Adeline street trolley wire. The
loose end hung down into the street
and it was this that horse struck.
Several people who saw the acci
dent said that Daniel was warned of
the ilangor as he approached the
broken wire, but paid no attention to
the warning and took no notice of the
wire until he had run into the hang
ing end and his horse had been killed
by the deadly current.
Intelligence was never so necessary
n the world as now. Ignorant people
have a sad time of it in this age.

LOTTERY GAMES
Officers of Berkeley Follow
Up Expose 1 of Gambling
.Made by Chinese Student
DOOES YIELD TO BLOWS
Invading Police Find That
Bird Has Flownâ Watch to
Be Kept by the Marshal
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 31.
Armed with axes, determined to pro
cure evidence which should convict the
Chinese gamblers of violating the larw.
Deputy Marshals Brothers and Camp
bell last night invaded the two fan
tan joints exposed by the university
student, Tom Ching. They broke i-n
the doors at the Dwight way resort
conducted by Chan Gam You, but the
fantan gamblers apparently had
flown. A group of grinning Chinese
stood about the room, in the center of
which was a long table, supposedly for
the gamblers' use. None of the fan
tan paraphernalia was to be found. Tne
Celestials laughed at the officers, who
had made a spectacular entrance but
were forced to 'conclude with an In
glorious exit.
The establishment of Cam Lee. on
Shattuck avenue, near Dwight way,
was also raided by the Deputy Mar
shals during the evening, but there, as
at the first place visited, all evidences
of gambling games had been carefully
removed.
Deputy Campbell remained on duty
all night at the Dwight way resort un
der orders from Marshal Kerns, who
has announced that every Chinese
gambler shall be driven from Berkeley.
The Marshal's indignation at the in
sinuation that he has been paid to pro
tect the gamblers is such as to lead
him to declare that he will make it his
particular business to wipe out every
w-estige of anything resembling gam
bling in the university town.
Tom Ching, the university youth
whose expose of the fantan joints was
made last night, has announced that
he will be pleased to go into court and
give his testimony against the
gamblers, but the authorities have de
cided apparently to take no action, so
far as legal prosecution is concerned.
A Deputy Marshal is to be detailed on
the task of keeping the Chinese from
gambling, and he will spend all of his
time watching the places where the
fantan devotees may be expected to
congregate. â 
BLLIJmXS ISSUED BY
AGKICULTI RAL PROFESSORS
Pear Scab Discussed by Ralph E.
Smith and Fertilizers by
Chemist Roberts.
BERKELEY, Jan. 31. â Professor
Ralph E. Smith has had printed a bul
letin dealing with the pear scab, cop
ies. of ; , the document coming to the
agricultural department of the uni
versity to-day from the State - print-
Ing office. Pear scab, the professor
says, is one of. the' most common plant
diseases, affecting the quality of the
fruit rather than the vitality of the
tree. His bulletin contains descrip
tions of methods calculated to control
the disease. The extent of the injury
to the pear crop by this disease is
written of by Professor Smith as fol
lows:
The scab growth is very superficial, affecting
only the outer surface tissues, , which are hard
and corky. Such fruit . la perfectly healthtul
and In no way Injurious because of thÂ« dis
ease, yet on account' of their poor appearance,
color and shape, pears which are badly
scabbed â¢ are almost entirely useless for any
purpose, while if at all seriously affected they
are r worthless for shipping, undesirable for
canning and poor for drying.
In years of abundant pear scab in Califor
nia unsprayed orchards ; have - shown losses of
from one-fourth to nearly all thÂ« crop In
marketable pears. â¢ This loss â¢ may be about
equally . divided between " the â  scab and - the
worm, although either would be able alone to
cause it. In an average year California ships,
cans and dries some 80.000 tons of marketable
pears, of a value, at $2* per ton. of $1,500,000.
From these figures. some idea ,may be formed
of the losses from pear scab in the State, con
sidering in relation to the total tonnage util
ized as above the . further i amount .or propor
tion rendered 'entirely unmarketable, and the
loss In quality on a large portion of that
actually â  soldâ a loss representing â  the differ
ence between *40 â¢ and , 515 ; or/ $20 per â¢ toa In
many seasons.
George Robprts, assistant chemist
in charge of fertilizer control, has
compiled matter for a bulletin on fer
tilizers Just issued by the State print
ing office. The bulletins include tables
givine the result of analyses made by
Mr. Roberts.

DISCOVERS GIRL
IN MALE ATTIRE
Jean Gordon, 17 Years Old,
Whom Polios Have Been
Looking For, Is Captured
ARBESTED Â£0B THEFT
Is Accused of Bobbing
Nels Carlson of $420,
but Escapes Conviction
OAKLAND, Jan. Sl.â After masquer
ading for a year and a half in male
attire and working as a bellboy and
messenger In, several hotels in San
Francisco and other cities, Jean Gor
don, a pretty 17-year-old girl, who is
alleged to be the daug-hter of wealthy
parents, was arrested at midnight to
night by Sergeant of Police Lynch at
the narrow gauge depot just as she
alighted from the train from San.
Francisco.
The girl is wanted by the Sao Fran
cisco police and the authorities in this
city had been requested to keep a
watch for her: When taken to the
police station the girl at first declared
that she was a boy, but she soon broke
down and confessed her Identity. She
is being held by the police awaiting
the arrival of a policeman from San
Francisco.
Miss Gordon was arrested in San
Francisco on October 15, 1904. for the
theft of $420 from Nels Carlson, but
she escaped conviction, and after be
ing released continued to masquerade
as a boy. In explanation of her action
in concealing ber sex, the girl says she
was able to obtain employment with
greater ease and was not as liable to
insult as if she had. as she says, "re
mained a girl." She refuses to talk
about herself or to tell anything about
her family.
The young woman will be taken to
San Francisco to-morrow by Detective
Freil.
IRVIXE GIVES UP FIGHT
AGAINST BISHOP TALBOT
Issues Statement. However, in Which
He Says Money Was Used to
Block Him.
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 31.â Rev. I.
W. W. Irvine to-day issued a statement
announcing that he had given up the
fight against Bishop Ethelbert Talbot.
Rev. Mr. Irving says he will drop all
proceedings against Bishop Talbot. both
ecclesiastical and legal. He states that
he is actuated by a deÃlre to prevent
further scandal to the Episcopal
church.
Dr. Irvine review*, the controversy
with the Bishop at length, and enu
merates facts not heretofore given
publicity. He charges that money and
influence were used by Bishop Talbot
to block his efforts to bring the case
before an ecclesiastical court. In de
ciding to proceed no further he says:
"I do not know what else can be done
with Bishop Talbot. who has brought
such a scandal upon the church and
such a scandal upon others, but to for
give him; and I herewith freely and
without reservation offer him a full
and free pardon, as if we were standing
on the last great day before the judg
ment throne of Jesus Ch-ist, our
eternal God."

A NON-PARTISAN TICKET.
IN view of the situation in San Francisco, as revealed by /.the ef- j
forts of the Merchants' Association, The Gall has advised that
a way out lies oh One path and cannot -be found on two, followed
at the same timÂ«. Obviously there must be a substantial union of
citizens and total abstention from division on party lines.
view of it has borne fruit, in the suggestion that citizens desirous
ci good government combine :. in every Assembly district and dele
gate a voluntary convention, to nominate a city ticket, thereafter
to be placed ob the ballot .by petition. The success of this re
quires that all in the movement shall refrain from participating in
the regular primary, as that wiir disqualify them as petitioners for
ajp'laee on the ballot for the non-partisan ticket.
It is often said by those who are interested in having it so, that
.* better to have a regular political party responsible for city gov
ernment. The argument looks well on its face. There are good
and high-minded men in aH parties. If they are to be responsible
: he acts of their party and can control it, we will readily admit
ihat party government is the best. But experience, and costly ex
perience, has proved that such men lose control of the official morals
n hen it is in power in a city. Party government, so
natural and so necessary in our system, works with expected fairness
and cleanness fa the administration of States and of the nation. But
nuniciyal government this quality evaporates, and misgovernment
the rme in all of our large cities, no matter which party is iv
Democrats tn Chicago and New York, and Republicans in Phil
â phia and elsewhere, seem alike incapable of carrying down into
municipal administration the virtues and the vigor of their party.
.er such circumstances there is a growing tendency to go on a
f discovery, in search of agencies outsid^ of parties through
vh cfty government can be administered with some of the up
right features which are the saving grace of State and national gov
nent. It seems necessary in cities to depend upon the personal
character of individuals, upon the interests and uplifting influences
and them, rather than upon the general character of parties. Of
everywhere found to be a task of supreme difficulty to
Â» bold of partisan organization in cities. It is difficult to
the habit of partisan attachment and fidelity, and this
by party bosses to carry through their schemes; which
illy end in misgovernment and often in public spoliation. To
eed, then. In a non-partisan purification of city government, it is
ry to have a campaign of education, in which the ideals of
p j wtxmmtnt are put aloft, and viewed until they obscure and
â¢c the allegiance to parties which is made the instrument of
bad administration.
Jn this city we have had such a campaign of education, carried
"'erchants' Association. That body, in some respects im
â¢ur community life, substituted itself for the city govern
t. Finding that government left the town continually dirty and
ently nasty, in a physical sense, the. association numbly but
began a? a street cleaner. The result was intensely satis
tory to all citizens. For the first time in the history of San
he streets were efficiently cleaned. There was a decline
the wet season and of dust in the dry. This work appealed
\. Ladies especially, who first heard of the Merchants'
\hr< >ugh the white-clad street cleaners, became its par
aim all shop and store keepers immediately realized that clean
-aved them money. Gathering strength by achievement and
cc. the association has become a valuable civic institution.
- â  r>ed at physical cleanness of the city, but has suc
y essayed to project its cleansing influence into municipal
lent. In this field its success has been equally marked and
ant. It has aimed to allow the ballot-box at least as clean
â¢ made the streets. Its individual members, moved upon by its
and showing high personal courage, guarded the polls and
, corrupters of the ballot-box tn punishment.
We are fortunate, then, in having this^educati6nal institution
here to lead men toward high and proper ideals in city government.
This y well stimulate hope that a general movement outside of
parties and bosses and machines and "the push" will
succeed in getting control of the city government. To do this there
must be zeal and watchfulness on the part of those who are im
pressed by the necessity of such control, and there must be an
awakemng of the fmlifierent. Every citizen is interested in giving
this city the best possible government.
San Francisco is entering upon an important stage of its history,
need no more vigilance committees of the sort that administered
a violent purgation to rascality in the fifties. That method was
suited to that stage of our growth and its conditions. It did work
that was vindicated by results, and though aliens from a distance have
deprecated it. we, who know all the facts, feel only honor and re
t for William T. Coleman and the men who made Fort Gunny
bags a temple of justice. But the Vigilance Committee needed to
day we liave already in existence in the Merchants' Association, and
we have our William T. Coleman in Mr. Fairfax Wheelan, dnpli
din others who belong to that body. Where it leads we believe
city will willingly follow. A careful inspection of the new
charter reveals it as a fundamental law, fit only to be administered
tndh agencies as a non-partisan movement can create. In parti
administration it presents extraordinary opportunities for cor
ruption and oppression. If it is ever to have a chance it must come
through higk-minded non-partisan agencies, with no motive what
ever except good, thorough, efficient, clean and decent government,
economically administered.
We discuss these matters, in the early stages of the formative
period of public opinion, in order that if there be abroad a desire to
take charge of the city government and put it in disinterested hands
the people who cherish that aspiration may have right leading and
light for their guidance. i
THE SACRAMENTO SENSATION.
T^HE revelations at Sacramento, involving four Senators, may
not be judged until the proofs are in. Men must not be con
demned unheard, nor until proof is forthcoming. But in one
respect this incident, in its present situation, is useful. It is notice
that the men and the interests heretofore made the victims of
"cinch bills" have discovered the means of defense and have the
courage to use them.
One remedy for rascality is to increase its risks. By making it
unsafe, those who seek office for the rascally use to which it may
be put will lose their motive and there will be an improvement in
the quality of public life. No legislator or other public officer has
any right to let himself be used for the purposes of personal revenge.
There are two forms of legislative corruption, two grand divisions
BO to speak. One is the cinch, the other revenge. The Senators ac
i d seem to stand charged with getting in on. both sides, and the
:ic will hear their explanations with interest, and will neglect
HO item of proof submitted for and against them.
It is the first time that there has been a chance to apply the
law respecting the bribing of legislators. We hare no doubt that
to past sessions the suspicions of this offense have been exaggerated,
that it has existed. The "parliamentary funds" of Insurance and
er corporations have been drawn upon for protective purposes,
and "business" has been done under the dome of the capitol. If the'
present case be proved, beyond all doubt, an example should be
made that will not be soon forgotten.

Finn" from Its ehelves. Here's another lowa Idea Just aching to be hit

The latest dictum of the London fashionables is that men's coats must

THE SAN FRANCISCQ CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1905:
THE FATALISM OF ESTHER
$ 6 V DON'T see- any wrong In tt!" I
I announced- stoujtly..
I Esther laughed.
T There had been a time when
Esther's laugh was a privileged
sight as well as sympathy. Dimples
played hide, and seek around her chal
lenging mouth; but the very birthplace
of laughter lay in her eyes, cerulean
and black-lashed. Now I was trou
bled over Esther's laugh. It began
and ended with her little mouth, and
never reached to her eyes at all.
"If I owned something," I continued
"and while I was away, some one took
it, whether by mistake, not knowing
it belonged to me, or by intention,
shouldn't 1 have a right to' take it
away from him?"
"O sophistry, thy name is Jack!
How came you to own me?" Esther
queried gently.
"By right of discovery," I answered
promptly. "Years and years ago â "
"Not so many," murmured Esther.
"Well, the day that you walked shy
ly into the school room, and the teach
er gave you a desk next to mine, and
without once glancing my way, you
went to reading in your little book."
"And you naughtily interrupted my
diligent study by smuggling over to
me a white candy, which flaunted
crimsonly on its somewhat sticky sur
face the impudent question, "Will you
be mine?"
"What did you do with the candy?"
I asked eagerly.
Esther toyed with the diamond on
her third finger â maledictions on its
bold glitter.
"I ate it," she acknowledged.
"You darling!" I axclaimed. "Of
course you ate it and by that sign and
symbol you became mine that minute,
and you are mine ncrw. Esther, take
off that ring."
"Jack," she said gravely, "you are
letting your fancy run away with your
good sense. We were children then.
If we had grown up together it might
have been different; but your path lay
in the East, while mine led me West,'
where I met Judge Wells. I had for-,
gotten youâ"
"Esther:" I protested.
"Had forgotten you," she repeated,
though a flush belied her words. "So
when Judge Wells did me the honor,
the very great honor. Jack, to ask
me to marry him, I consented. If you
had stayed in the East where you be
longed, all would have been well, but
ycru must come, out here, and make
me miserable!" She turned suddenly
toward the window, and her little hand
made a quick move toward her eyes.
"Esther, dear, it were better that
you are miserable now for a little time,
better that I came before your mar
riage than afterward. It isn't too late
t.i rectify matters now, dear."
"It is too late," she insisted, "and I
am not your dear. It is right for me
M marry Judge Wells, or it wouldn't
have happened so. If you were the
right one, why didn't you come
sooner?"
"Esther, you are a fatalist."
"You may call me what you please,
but I must do right. I have prom
ised to marry Judge Wells â "
"It isn't ripht for you to give your
self to him, when every time you see
him you wish it were some one else.

Esther turned sharply toward me.
"What right have .you to eay â how
do you know I do â that?"
Poor little Innocent darling. â 
"I know j'ou love me," I answered
gloomily.
Esther neither denied nor assented.

the window. I left my chair and went
over to her.
"Little girl, you won't be happy. I
should say it even if I didn't want you
bo badly myself. Judge Wells is im
maculate in appearance, manners,
morals; but he is not sympathetic. He
never palliates an offense In his legal
work, nor overlooks cri indiscretion in
his private life. He â "
"I think you misjudge him, but any
way, it isn't a question of my own
happiness. I settled all that since
you came; but i can make him happy,
and I promised, and I will. Oh, Jack,
if you won't go away, let's go out in
the air! I'm stifling."
I brought her garden hat, all
wreathed with flowers the color of her
dear eyes, and we went out. We went
down the walk into the dusty highway.

Mischievous babe with the eves of blue.
Laughing at other folk.

Some little baby Joke.
Laughing and happy and clever, too,
Mischievous baby with eyes of blue.
Calm is the baby with eyes of gray,
Dear little stay-at-home.
Near to the mother in work and play â
Never will care to roam.

Willful the baby with ey es of black,
Ruling us more and more.

Brighter than those before!

PORTLAND FAIR
'AND THE ASTORS
The managers of the Lewis and
Clark Exposition, which will *be held
at Portland, Ore., next summer, have
written many letters to the Astor fam
ily of New York and London and have
explained to them how grateful would
be any encouragement or assistance
rendered by that family to the promot
ers of this exposition. Thus far there
has been no reply made from any
member of the family to any citizen
of Portland. This matter seems some
what strange, for there are many of
us who refuse to believe that the As
tor family, wealthy as it is, has ceased
to be American at heart. America
was kind to John Jacob Astor, and has
been kind to all his descendants. To
be sure, that early Astoria venture,
which gave the United States its first
hold on the far Northwest Territory,
was almost the only failure made by
that shrewd merchant, John Jacob
Astor. It cost him more than $4,000,
000. It helped gain ior America very
much more than that, and America
has paid the Astors since then very
much more than that. That failure
ana that loss occurred one hundred
years ago. I do not think the Astor
family ought to lay It so seriously to
heart lam sure if I had lost $4,000,
000 a hundred years ago I should not
mind it now, especially if I were able
to console myself with the greater
part of New ,York and a Â«llce of Eng
land. If the Astor family, out of their
abundance, should prove American
enough to help on so distinctly Ameri
can and distinctly worthy an enter
prise as the Lewis and Clark Exposi
tion, I am sure that muskrats, marten,
otter and beaver of America would
rise up and called them blessed after
aH. The Astor family is popularly
supposed to have outgrown its musk
rat days. â B. Hough, In January Field
and Stream.
Grace for the Country.
It Is astonishing wMat a erase Lon
doners have of late years developed for
the country, says The Sketch. The pa
pers are full of advertisements for elig
ible sites or ideal properties, while, on
the other hand, opulently proportioned
town mansions stand untenanted.
We Rscended a hill, and stood . at the
top, watching some boys coasting down
the other side. ' They sat in their
wagonsâ they had two l-oped tandems,
and, with their feet upon the axle to-!
guide their course, they steered swift- j
ly and noisily down the slope.
"We used to coast .on sleds down
snow-covered hills, Esther," I re- ,
marked ; then an object in the distance ;
caught my eye. I was properly thank
ful, just then, that Esther's pretty eyes
were a trifle near-sigh.ted. The bqys
were dragging their wagons slowly
toward us. .
"Esther, let's hire the wagons, and '
coast down the hill. Just once, for the
happy old times' sake."
She laughed nervously.
"How absurd, Jack! Suppose some- .
body saw us?"
"It's a small request when you deny
BM happiness," I whispered.
She was silent, so I made the bar
gain with the grinning boys. With
some weak protesting from Esther, I
assisted her into the back wagon, and
took my place in the front.
"Not a great amount of room, but
we can't always have everything just ;
to suit us," I remarked cheerfully,
putting my feet on the axle, and taking
the wagon tongue in my hands.
With considerable advice -from the
officious owners, we were off. . Faster
and faster we sped, dodging rocks,
running perilously near a live oak tree,
and drawing up on the little wooden
bridge, into the dignified presence of
Judge Wells.
"Good morning, Judge," I said
Jauntily. "Great sport, this California
coasting. Do you ever indulge?"
But the Judge took no notice of
me. His horrified gaze was upon
TCsthe. , his affianced wife, curled un
gracefully in the trailer, her hat gone, j
her yellow hair rippling over her |
shoulders, and her laugh ringing out
like a reckless child's.
The Judge opened his mouth, and
his words rasping as the filing of a
saw.
"Miss Graham. I wish to consider
our engagement as if It had never ex
isted. I must deny myself the pleas
ure of being the life-companion of a
â urn âhoyden!"
With stately stride the Judge as
cended the hill. The boys Had over
taken us. I paid them, and they ran,
shouting, away. Then I turned, not
without some misgivings, toward Es
ther. She was crouched on a rock
at the end of the bridge, her yellow
hair covering her as with a mantle,
her. shoulders shaking ominously. Was
it with grief or laugrhter? I advanced,
retreatedâ advanced. Then she spoke.
"Jack. dear, are you sure you paid
those precious boys enough?"
And looking at her I was content,
for the laughter that played around
her challenging mouth had also re
turned to her pretty eyes.

HEALTH-SEEKING
IN CALIFORNIA
Elmer Grey writes in thr January
number Of the Architectural Record:
"When one comes to the Far West for
the first time he is impressed with the
country by the number of tents and
tenthouses everywhere seen, not only
in the outskirts of cities, but often in
their very midst; the canvas home of
the pioneer settler is still much in evi
dence. Next come the simple wooden
dwellings of the poorer classes, square
little cottages most of them, with
awkwardly hipped roofs, but many
displaying a degree of taste that might
mystify one not familiar with a cer
tain phase of California social life;
for here, of all places in the world, a
man's financial condition or the kind
of work he does is not to be taken
as an index of his real worth."
Mr. Grey continued: "Politics makes
strange bedfellows, but no more so
than does health-seeking in Califor
nia. An able young clergyman, for
ir-etance, thrown out of a pastorate
by untoward circumstances, is found
applying for work at the packing
house of a lemon exchange. A young
architect who once had an enviable
practice builds up his health as a hired
hand on a ranch, with wages of $25 a
month and board; one of his table
companions at the cheapest of cheap
boarding-houses being the stableman
of the lady with whom he rides horse
back in the evening! A woman who
drives a coach and four when at home,
hobnobs at Catallna Island with the
captain of a pleasure launch, every
Inch a gentleman, but without a penny
In his pocket."

YOELL'S WILLS
Dr. John McMahon Says De- 1
. ceased * Capitalist Was in!
Habit of Changing* Mind I
â¦
BAILED AT DAUGHTERS
.
Other * -Witnesses Testify as
to Peculiar Disposition of
the Erratic Land Owner '
â¢
The witnesses who appeared at the I
hearing of the Yoell will contest In
Superior Judge Kerrigan's court yes
ter&ay had many interesting things to
tell about the deceased capitalist. One
told how adept he had been in making
wills, while others related stories of
fcls stinginess and "peculiar disposition.
Dr. John McMahon, who had been
Yoeii's physician for several years, de
clared that the dead capitalist used
to amuse himself by making wills.
Dr. McMahon says thai Yoell on
several occasions made wills cutting
his daughter. Mrs. Charles Levy, off
with $5. Yoeli is Quoted as having said:
"Mrs. Levy and that scoundrel Charles
want to get me out of the way."* This
thought would anger the old man to
euch an extent that he cut them off,
with â  $5 apportionment.
On another occasion the old man is
quoted as having wished his- other
daughter, Mrs. Parkhurst, dead. Dr.
McMahon testified that Yoell at other
times wished Mrs. Levy out of the way
because she had antagonized him by
marrying outside of her religion.
Dr. Gardner, the Chinese interpreter, |
translated the testimony of Ah Kirn, '
the Chinese cook-. The Celestial tula" of
how Yoell feared that some one had
put poison in his coffee. Ah Kirn re
fused to believe that such was the '
ca.se and testified that he informed
Yoell he was "clary." *
Miss Gertrude Yoell was the prln- '
cipal* witness en the stand during the
afternoon session. She related inci
dents regarding her father's home life
end bis peculiar manner and .disposi
tion, fihe told of how tight he was in
money matters and never gave his
children too much wealth to squander.
She told of* her., trip to Europe with
fcjm and how he* refused to visit the â¢
graves of his ancestors in a London
cemetery. She also related how Yoell
had struck his wife on one occasion,
and another time pulled a pistol on
Mrs. Levy and said he would shoot
her. The old man's peculiar fascina
tion for religion and his adept way of
cursing and calling names to the mem
bers of his family were again brought
out in Miss Yoell's testimony.
Miss Yoell was cross-questioned by
Attorney Delmas "for h the proponents
and she proved equal to the occasion.
Phe rarely hesitated in her answers
1 and her memory proved to be excel
lent. Attorney Delmas wanted to in
troduce one of Yoell's letters in evi
dence, but Attorney Hoefler refused
unless Delmas granted him the privi
lege of first looking tat it. This the
latter refused to do, and he was up
held by the Judge.
Mrs. Margaret Speer and G. W. Mln
streil were called to tell what they
knew about Yoell's actions while the
dead capitalist was staying at High- Â«
land Springs. Their testimony failed
to bring out any, startling develop
ments. "Several letters written by Yoell
to his children in endearing terms were â¢
offered as evidence. The case will con
tinued this morning at 10:30. Attorney
Hoefler announced that he expected
to close his case to-day.

TWO MEASURES
RECEIVE FAVOR
City Seal Estate Brokers
Refuse to Indorse Bill
Covering Oral Contracts
VOTE IS VERY CLOSE
â¢
Representative of the Los
Angeles Realty Board Is
Unable to ' Change Result
â¢
Representative men from some of the
large real estate brokerage houses of
San Francisco held two meetings in j
the Mills building- yesterday to hear !
the arguments advanced by Secretary |
Burdett of the Los Angeles Realty j
Board in favor of indorsing certain j
legislative measures that have met
favor in the southern city. At the
forenoon session Frederic E. Mage*
presided- At the afternoon hearing
Spencer C. Buckbee occupied the chair.
The results, so far as compliance, with :
the wishes of the Los Angeles Realty j
Board are concerned, were mixed. m j
It was voted to indorse a bill that f
compels property owners to . remove j
weeds" from and to prevent the dump- i
* ing of garbage upon any vacant loj i
, within the limits of a municipality. [
i Very little discussion was needed to :
obtain a favorable vote on this. S It is :
provided, in part,' by the bill, that su
perintendents of streets shall proceed
to abate nuisances of the sort indi
cated, from vacant city lots, jat the
cost of the lot owners, and where there
is no street superintendent the Board
of Works may act. . , . ;
The second of the measures urged by
the Los Angeles Realty Board was not j
adopted in original form, but the gen- |
eral idea found approval. This bill pro- \
posed. to provide a speedy way to oust
delinquent tenants. It appeared, dur
; ing a discussion at the morning ses- j
sion, that a bill had been prepared to
the same general intent at the Instance ;
of A. J. Rich of this city. % j
The San Â» Francisco real estate men
and the Dps Angeles men came to
gether on this proposition and the rep- â¢
resentative of the Los Angeles Realty
Board said that those whom he repre- J
seated would accept Mr. Rich's bill as
a substitute for theirs. *
The third measure found stout oppo
sition and also some favor, but was
finally denied the indorsement of those
present by a close vote, there , being
fifteen firms in favor and sixteen
against on a roll call. The bill in
question legalizes oral contracts to sell i
real estate. The text of the bill is, in !
part, as follows: '?â¢;/Â»"â '-â â¢*â .!
An agreement authorizing or employing- an
agent or broker to purchase or sell real estate
for compensation or a commission: Provided.
that if. under an oral agreement or authority .
â with such agent or broker by the owner of real
property, or his or her agent duly authorized
In writing to make such agreement or grant 1 .
such authorization, a sale or purchase of real
estate has* been actually made by or through
men ag'-nt, and the title to such real property
has been transferred, such oral agreement or
authority phall bit valid ana may be estab
lished by parel testimony; provided that U>o
grantor or grantee shall m liable for but one
commission or compensation; and, provided
further, that such agent or broker claiming a
compensation or commission, under an oral
agreement, shall bring suit for the collection
of such commission or compensation within sixty
days after the recording of the transfer cvi
! dencing such purchase or sale, and shall file a
â written undertaking, executed by two or more
sufficient sureties, approved by the Judge of
the court in which said suit shall be brought,
to the effect that if the defendant recover*
Judgment the plaintiff will pay defendant's
. counsel fee to an amount cot exceeding $100
and all \ court costa that may be sustained by
the defendant In such suit, the exact amount of
; the counsel fee to be fixed by the court.
Mr. Burdett argued very strongly
â  and Sat great length for indorsement
of this bill. He suggested that the
brokers In San Francisco 1 would not be
hurt by the bill, if enacted into law,
and that Los Angeles would be largely
benefited- 'He also pleaded for co
operation on the part of this section
of the State with * the south. Repre
i sentatives of large houses were found
on each side .of the question when the
vote was finally taken.
Among those who took 'part In the
1 debate on one side or the other were
: George C. Boardman Jr., Frederio
i Magee, J. H. Speck, F. B. Surryhne,
I A. Aronson, Spencer C. Buckbee, C. T.

FLEES TO AVOID
MORE DISGRACE
William Vincent Writes to
Mother of Deluded Girl
That He Has Left State
â¦ â
WIFE GETS ALLOWANCE
Â«Â« â â
Judge Graham Orders That
Deserted Woman Shall Be !
Paid $35 Every Month
"William Vincent has left the State to
avoid the exposures promised by hia
wife's attorney in further prosecution
of her suit for separate maintenance.
Yesterday was his last chance to ap
pear in Judge Graham's court, and hia
attorney, George Averill, appeared
without him. Attorney Ferman, rep
resenting the wife, announced that he
had been Informed of the derelict's dis
appearance through the family of the
Oakland girl, who was mentioned sfi
co-respondent in the case.
Vincent had written to her mother
that he would leave to avoid disgrac
ing them further. Ferman offered the
evidence of P. R. E. Allen, who knew
of Vincent's frequent visit* to the
Oakland girl's house, and said that he
was supposed to be a single man.
After the fact of his marriage became
known he never went there again. It
appears that $2750 worth of property
bought In the girl's name is thought
to have been paid for bjr Vincent.
Judge Graham ordered that Mrs. Vin
cent should be paid $35 a month and
should have the household furniture, j
She aIBO has an Interest In consider- '
able community property.
An extremely pretty little woman,
blonde and blue-eyed, was Maude do
Lacey, who came into Judge Graham's
court yesterday and got a divorce from
Jean de Lacey, an operatio baritone.
They were married three years ago In
Australia, when both were members of
the Stanton Opera Company, but he
was cruel to her and she has not seen
him for more than a year. She says
that she has given up the stag* tem
porarily and Is making point lace for a
living.
A divorce was granted by Judge Qra
ham to Gussie G. Phelan from Ed N.
P. Phelan on the grounds of cruelty
and neglect. She is the bookkeeper
and cashier for a local business house.
His attorney was present to oppose the
decree, but offered no evidence, prom
ising that a motion may be made to
reopen the case after his client returns.
Other divorces were granted by
Judge Kerrigan to Archibald Charrn&n
from L. R. S. Charman, desertion;
Clara M. Noonan from John G. Noo
nan, extreme cruelty; by Judge Hunt
to Thomas W. Walsh from Margaret
Walsh, intemperance; Judge Hebbard
annuled the marriage of Myrtle E.
Rountree with James M. Lathrop be
cause he has another wife living. Hat
tie A. Barton-Botts sued for an an
nulment of her marriage with William
T. Botts. which took place In Octo
ber, 1898. Phe has elnce discovered that
her former husband Is not dead. Suit
for divorce was filed by Margaret BaÃ
tian against Charles Bastlan, whom
she accuses of cruelty. They were

I and were discussing the playings of . a.
I searchlight . across the murky heavens I
i when ' a man who came walking slowly
up the driveway suddenly wheeled
upon them with gleaming revolver in

last time he emphasized* hiB words by
pressing â¢ the revolver against . :: Rock
lin's waistooat, very uncomfortably,
and added, "Don't trifle with me."
, There was Immediate . . compliance. ,.
With the ugly firearm in one hand, the
holdup man with the other searched
Rocklin's pockets. They yielded but a j
dollar In small change. Then he began !
:to hunt ' * for the . watch. f Rocklin's J
â  nerves were active end â â . involuntarily
he â ' brought his, hands down to draw
his overcoat tight. '
The robber jumped back affrighted,'
but still with revolver leveled. ; ; "Don't
you move, don't you holler, do you,
hear?" he spoke In subdued but com
pelling voice that rooted Rocklin to the.
spot. "Those words were : full of shir

puts it. '" â 'â â â  â  : - â  - V" ; â ''â  â :Â« -,-W.V.

' was restored to composure. Rocklin

to the story. Rocklin was on duty be-

Dissolves Railroad Injunction.
Judge Seawell yesterday vacated the
order made two weeks ago restraining
the Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railway
from crossing the spur track of the
California and Northwestern Railroad
on Railroad avenue in Santa Rosa.
Evidence was taken and arguments
heard last week. The spur, which*
runs to Grace Bros,' brewery, was in
frequently used but cut off the ap
proach of the new electric line within
100 yards of the land it had purchased
at a cost of $20,000 for terminal faci
lities. The old line blocked the way
of its rival and had a switch engine,
under steam, near the point of cross
ing to prevent any forcible laying of
track.

of Eegion to Secure Timber
FORTULND, Jan. XLâ A batch of
four indictment*, containing accusa
tions against seventeen persons In all,
was returned to-day by the Federal
Grand Jury In the land frauds cases.
; Most of the indicted persons, including
I Senator John H. Mitchell and Con
gressman Binger Hermann, the only
two named who axe of more than local
prominence, have been indioted before
on practically the same charges.
The Indictment which mention*
Mitchell and Hermann names ten others.
It charges conspiracy to defraud the
Government of public lands. The In
dictment Is Intended to remove any
Illegality that might have occurred
I when Mitchell and Hermann were
first indicted.
One indictment Involved wholly new
persons who are alleged to have oper
ated in an entirely different district.
These are Henry W. Miller, Frank H.
Kincart. Martin Q. Hoge and Charles
NlckelL Nickell is the United States
Land Commissioner at Medford. Ore.;
Hoge Is a lawyer Of the same town.
Kincart and Millar arc timber locators
whose headquarters were up to the time
of their apprehension last fall at Med
ford. They are eaid to ba agents of
a lumber company whose place of busi
ness Is In Michigan.
Tfrs charges against these man arÂ»
I that they colonized largÂ« bodies of
men, whom they caused. It Is alleged.
to swear falsely that the colonists were
bona fide purchasers of timber lands,
when in fact, the indictment asserts,
they were under contract to sell to the
timr>er locators.

rants ware Issued under a fourth in- |

WHY DOCTORS FAIL
AND MRS. PINKHAM SUCCEEDS
Plain Reasons Are Hers Given to Exptmli
Why Lydla E. PlnMiam's Vegetable Ota-
pound Cure* When Doctors Are Powerless
A woman Is sick? some disease peculiar
to her sex is fast developing In tier sys-
tem. She roes to her family physician*
and tells him a story, but not the whole
story. ' â â â  â  '-. . "' 'â  'â  . '
She holds something back, loses her
head, becomes agitated, forgets what
she Wants . to say, and finally conceal*
what she ought to hare told, and thus
completely mystifies the doctor. '_ :
' Is it any wonder, therefore, that the
doctors fail to care the disease T - Still
we cannot; blame \ the woman, for ,It is
very embarrassing to detail some of the
symptoms of her suffering, even to her
family physician.
It was for this reason thai rears ago
Mrs. Pinkhatn, at Lynn, Mass., de-
termined to step in and help her sex.
Having had considerable experience in
treating female ills with her Vegetable
Compound, she encouraged the women
of America to write to her for advice in
regard to their complaints, and being Â»
woman, it was easy for her ailing sis-
ters to pour into her ears every detail
of their suffering. Â . ' '.':â¢'â 
In this way she was able to do for
them what the physicians were unable
to \ do, simply because she . had the
proper information to work upon, and
from the little group of women who
sought her advice years ago a great
army of - her fellow-beings' are to-day .
constantly applying f er advice and re-
lief, and ; the : fact that ; many : thou-
sands of them v have been cured .by
following the advice of Mrs.' Pinkham
during the last year is indicative of the
grand results which I are ; produced by
her unequaled experience and training.
No 'physician in the world has had
such a training, or has such an amount
of information at hand to assist in the
treatment of , all kinds of female ills,
from the simplest â  local ; ; irritation to '
the \ most â  complicated ' womb diseases, \
â¢ This, therefore, is Â» the > reason , why. j
Mrs. . Pinkham, â¢: in , : her i laboratory at \
Lynn, : Mass., is able to do- more for the â 
ailing j, women \ of America "than the >
family physician. -Any, woman, there- :
fore, is responsible for her own suffer-
ing who will not take = the trouble to
write to Mrs; s Pinkham for advice. C ;
; The testimonials which we are con-
stantly publishing from grateful wo-
men -, establish % beyond \a ; doubt the
power of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound to ' oonojuer female diseases.

NEIL VICTORIUS
Over "Fighting Dick" Hyland in a Ring Contest
Which is Fiercely Waged for Fifteen Fast Rounds
DEFEATED BOXER SHOWS
MARKED GAMENESS AND
GREAT HITTING POWER
NEIL DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON HIS LEFT HAND
End Comes Unexpectedly From a Snappy Left to the
Jaw After Innumerable Blows Land
Frankie Neil, the ex-bantamweight
champion of the world, gave away four
pounds in weight to- Dick Hyland last
night and in fifteen rounds knocked
out the young boxer who was making
his debut as a professional. There was
no disgrace in the defeat for Hyland,
as he put up a game battle, fighting
with all the coolness of a veteran of
the ring and never losing his head in
the hottest parts of the engagement.
For a number of rounds Hyland
seemed to be wearing down his clever
opponent, and for a time it appeared
thsff he would surely be returned a win
ner. When the fight had gone half the
distance the spectators settled back as
if thinking it Mould go the' limit of
twenty rounds. There was reason for
their thinking so, as each boxer had
landed some hard Wows which seemed
to , have no effect on his opponent. It.
was hardly possible to count the num
ber of times Neil sent Ryland's head
pack. with stiff left jabs. On the. other
hand, Hyland landed some.' rights to
Neil's head and body. ,
The md cam* suddenly and unex
ptCtecly in the fifteenth round. Neil
had been using his left almost exclu
sively throughout the fight, and the
blow which finally won him the long
â¢Mid of the purse seemed no different
than hundreds which had landed be
fore. ThiÂ« time, however, th* blow
landed on the point of the chin and
Hylaud fell over backward in a help
uanner. Hig head struck the edge
ne ring with a resounding crash,
Urns addiug to the damage inflicted by
ib* blow of the giove. Hyland was
clow ii about flw seconds, and when he
staggered to his feet Neil was after
him like a tiger. He half pushed, half
ried Hyland down again. Hyland
again struggled to hfs feet. Neil kept
shooting In terrible lefts to the head,
iind Hyland had nearly sense enough
to cover up without being able
. ck the blows. He was driven on
c ropes tn his own corner and his
â  de drenched him with water, in
the hope rtf reviving him. He clung
Â«>n the rÂ«pes in a helpless manner for
h while and was again sent to the
floor. The spectators were urging
cc Greggaine to stop it when Hy
!and was again gent to the mat. He
; over on his back and was counted
out. He was carried to hie corner and
quickly revived by his seconds.
He was terribly cut about the face and
Neil also bore the marks of battle.
JIYLA>D POPULAR.
From the stari the sympathies of
the spectators were with Hyland.
There was nothing of the showy box
m about him, nor of the ideal ath
lete. As he has round shoulders he
from being a prize beauty. He
proved a veritable fighting machine
irom the start, wading in and taking
all manner of blows Just for a chance
to land one himself.
He was fashionably late in entering
the ring, keeping both his opponent
and the spectators waiting for ten
minutes. He was seconded by Jack
McCormack, Dave Sullivan and Billy
McDonald. In Neil's corner were his
trainer. Frank McDonald; Spider Kel
ly and Tim McOrath. Some one, not
knowing the superstitions of fighters,
had a beautiful floral piece made with
the word "Success" worked out in
ftamjng red. When the messenger
beaiing it was seen by Neil's handlers
their ordered him away from their
corner and then he took it over to
Hyland. for whom It was intended.
He was nearly assaulted over there
Snally retired without having de
livered the emblem. There was the
usual procession of boxers in the ring
before the fight started, including
Marvin Hart, Jack Johnson, Young
Corbet!, Ah Wing, the Chinese cham
pion, and Jimmy Britt. Corbett, as
seemed a great favorite with
the spectators, the dapper feather
.l being gneeted with three
.heere. Hyland'fi aggressive style of
fighting quickly won him the sympa
ihy and applause of the spectators,
while they took offense at trte clever
ness displayed by Jleil. Neil fought in
the style of the invincible Tommy
Ryan, jabbing with his left, then
dancing quickly out of t&e reach of
the wild swings directed at him by
Hyland. Hyland seemed slow to start,
being unable to get set to hit effectu
ally, ac his balance was being contin
ually upset by Neil.
OOOL lirtJER FIRE.
Hyiand's e*oln*M under fire was a
â urpiise to the spectator*, who ex
pected the ex-amateur to go to pieces
In the exciting periods of fhe fight.
He never showed the slightest stage
fright, and seemed to know wh^at was
required of him at all times. It was
the opinion of old-time followers of the
ring that if Nell had a right hand in

keeping with his left he would be the
greatest fighter the world has ever
seen. For a time it seemed that his
right was injured, as he seldom used
it. but later on it developed that he
depended on the terrible punishing
power of his left. He nearly closed
Hj-land'a right eye In the third round
with his continual jabbing, and kept,
peppering at the eye during the re
mainder of the fight. Hyland evened
up the score in this resDect in the
twelfth round by landing a terrible
right to Neil's left eye. The blood
spurted from the wound and gave Neil
a gory appearance. His seconds doc
tored it skillfully and it seemed to give
him but littLe trouble during the re
mainder of the fight. The total re
ceipts of the fight were $6210. Of this
Nei? received $1928 90. while Hyiand's
share was $1038 60. The club paid $255
fbr the two preliminary fights, leav
ing it J2SSB with which to pay-the ex
pe nP op Âf and put some
money aside.
GOOD START MADE.
In the first round Hyland landed one
effective blow, a right to the head,
which staggered Neil. For the remain
der of the round Nell contented himself
with" jabbing the left to the head and
<â >< oasionally sending a right to the
body. Near the end of the round Hy
land landed lightly on Neil's head and
body. Hyland tried all he knew in the
second round, but he could not land an
effective blow on Xeil. Early in the
third round Hyland beat Neil to the
punch, landing a left before Neil's
blow could reach its mark. Neil landed
a hard left to the body and then nearly
closed Hyiand's right eye with a left
hook. He nearly knocked Hyland off
hip feet a moment later with another
left that caught Hyland when he was
off his balance. Hyland landed a left
to the body, then a right while they
were clinched on the ropes. Neil as
sumed to pay all his attention to Hy
iand's sore eye, which he kept Jabbing
continuously. Neil landed a left to the
head in the fifth round, then a right to
the body in return. Hyland landed re
peatedly in this round, but from all ap
pearances Neil was not trying. Hyland
landed a punishing left in the sixth
round and followed it almost imme
diately with a right, having Neil on
the ropes in a corner. Neil ripped two
lefts to the body in the seventh, then
rushed Hyland to the ropes. He kept
pecking away with his left to Hyiand's
RARE MUSIC
IS MADE BY
DOLMETSCHES
One hardly knows where to begin on
the Dolmetech entertainmentâ for "en
tertainment, " in the charming old
fashion, these accomplished folk label
their music â there is in it so much and
so varied delightsomeness. Most truly
indeed may their concerts be called
entertainment. "The Harmonious
Blacksmith," played as Papa Handel
might have played it, on a beautiful
old harpsichord from which his pudgy
digits may have coaxed its roulades,
is of Ihe kind of thing the Dolmetsches
have to give.
l^ast evening at Lyric Hall they gave
their first entertainment. A fair house
ful of people gathered to its hearing.
Every stripe of music lover was among
them. Many, perhaps most, brought a,
eonseienceful '.-ar to glue to stuff that
should be heard. Simple curiosity also
had its contingent. There were those
there also because, being supposedly
caviare to the general, the Dolmetsch
affairs are most particularly and ex
clusively "the thing" to go to. Then
there were 'a few, a very few, that knew
of the pleasure in store. Possibly these
even did not quite picture the distin
guished charm of the Dolmetsch music.
I own myself to being persuaded and
surprised into a rareness of enjoyment
that 1 did not know music still held
for me. But there was one voice only
as to the Dolmetsch music â that it is
music, music rarely, keenly delightful;
jbusic to be enjoyed by any and every
one, as well by those that know Strauss
from Lee Johnson as by those that
won't.
The entertainment begins before a
note is sounded. It begins when the
players, three of them, Mr. Arnold Dol
metsch, Mrs. Mabel Dolmetsch and
Miss Katherine Salmon, wander on the
platform in their quaintly fashioned
costumes. Particularly picturesque is
Mr. Dolmetsch, mostly enormous,
whimsical black eyes and hair, and
garbed in his knee broeches and doublet
of sad-colored velvet, and buckled
Shoes. In her fine red gown and de
mure coiffure Mrs. Dolmetsch looks
something like a Saint Cecilia: Miss
Salmon, in green velvet, a more robust
devotee of the art. It Is all a Dicture.
particularly with its background of the
lovely vermilion of the lacauer of the
harpsichord, the viola da jjamba. and
the lute apd virginals lying about.
Mr. Dolmetsch begins the programme
with a lively dissertation on tne old
music, with advice to the audience to
bring their child's unsophisticated ears
to its hearing. He describes Dictur
esquely the ancient Instruments, their
peculiar qualities, their fiistory. Each
number i? most usefully and TJiaiÃintly
thus preluded. The instruments used
last evening were the harpsichord, the
viola da gamba, the lute, the vireinals
â upo^i which Queen Elizabeth Dlaved â
and two others of the viol grouts Mr.
Dolmetsch himself plays upon efrery-
I thing but the piano stool â a harpsichord
enthusiast, he would disdain even this
approach to a pianoforte! Mrs. Dol
metsch s instrument in particular is
: the viol da gamba; she plays also upon
the haH>sichord. Miss Salmon does the
singing and also plays delightfully
upon fhe harpsichord.
An to the tone of the instruments,
j that wonderful, delicate mellowness,
that pure, penetrant warmth, one
must go to Shakespeare, to Spenser
to find its phrase. Hearing it, in the
limpid, spontaneous sentence of this
morning literature of music, one un
dtrptandsÂ»4he joy of the old poets in
the art. The programme began with
two "pieces" for the lute, Mr.
Dclmetsch luting. Scotch and Italian,
both dances, they were, dated 1600;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1908.
body. Near the end of the round Hy
land suddenly sent a right to the body
which nearly lifted Neil off his feet.
Neil's mouth commenced to bleed in
the eighth round.
Hyland landed a hard swing to the !
head after feinting to the body. He j
then made a wild swing with his right I
and barely missed Neil's head. Hyland ;
had a decided advantage in the ninth
round, landing a hard right and left on
the body when Neil was on the ropes.
CARELJCSS IX TENTH.
Nell 'seemed a little careless in the
tenth round and got a hard right on
the jaw just a shade too far back to be
effective. Near the end of the round
Neil had Hyland on the ropes. Hyland
scored a number of good blows in the
eleventh round, but it was in the
twelfth that he looked all over a win
ner. He sent a crushing blow that
landed just above Neil's left eye and
sent a stream of blood from it. Hy
land fought in this round as if his life
depended on it, and had Neil in marked
distress. The spectators hardly ex
pected Neil to recuperate. Neil took
matters fairly easy in the thirteenth
round and Hyland did most of the
scoring. Hyland got in a chance blow
to the head in the fourteenth round
that seemed to shake Neil up. Nell
came back with right and letâ¬ to the
head and then repeated to the body.
Hyland hurt Neil with a right to the
head. Neil opened up the fifteenth and
last round with his usual jab and Hy
land seemed desperate and ready to
take any chance. All his hopes of vic
tory were suddenly dashed wlÂ» v the
sharp left which did not seem to have
unusual force behind it, but which
landed him on his back and eventually
made him a defeated boxer.
Billy Snailham easily outpointed
Jockey Bennett in the first bout of
the evening. Bennett was lucky to last
the ten rounds. Snailham swung wildly
countless times and many of the blows
barely missed their mark. Snailham
made his best showing in the first three
rounds and again in the last two.
Referee Mark Shaughnessy made a
hit with the spectators when he de
clared the ten-round bout between Joe
Angeli and Jack Cordell a draw. It was
all fight throughout. Each man seemed
to have the best of the argument at
times but neither had & decisive punch.
Several of the rounds were veritable
slugging bees, but the boxers weathered
the storm.
both with a plaintive lilt that made
the audience ask them again. How
ever, there were no encores. This lute,
by the way, is the only instrument of
its kind known to be in existence.
Followed then Miss Salmon, in an old
French folksong, lute accompanied.
Miss Salmon has a voice and art of
almost the same aloofness as the music
and the other instruments. The voice
is sweet and pure and used with a
singular absence of affectation, with
a curious simplicity. It fits entirely
ir.to the songs she sings. She sang
besides a "Lark Song" by Henry
H.iwes (1669) and a lovely Ariosto
cantata (1710).
Mr. Dolmetsch was heard then on
the virgjnals in "Muscadin," with fresh
delight. He took up afterward the
treble viol and accompanied by Mrs.
Dolmetsch on the virginals gave a
quaint "Spagnioletta." Then Mr. Dol
metsch took to the harpsichord, giving
two Rameau numbers and Couperin in
a fashion that richly illustrated the
beauties and amazing resources of the
instrument and his own musicianship.
Mrs. Dolmetsch contributed after this
two pieces for the viola da gamba by
Forqueray pere et fils, J7OO-1725, also
exhibiting large technical accomplish
ment, temperament and discovering an
instrument of richest and most per
suasive beauty â small wonder they
called it the viola d'amore.
The Ariosto cantata had It for ao
companiment, also the harpsichord. A
Teleman sonata, "The Harmonious
Blacksmith," and three Rameau trios
concluded the programme. After It
the audience was invited to the plat
form to examine the instruments, and
most of it accepted. There are two
more of the concerts â to-morrow even
ing and Saturday afternoon. If you do
noc care to hear them go to look at the
Dolmetsches. But there is no Callfor
nian that will not care to hear them

WELIi EXTEND OPERA SEASON.
Tivoli Management Induces Singers to
Stay Two Weeks Longer.
No announcement of the current mu
sical season has been received with
greater enthusiasm than that which
has just emanated from the Tivoli
management to the effect that the suc
cessful grand opera season now run
ning at the theater will be extended
for a period of two weeks.
This popular course Is the only ofte
that could have been pursued und^r the
pressure of the enormous music-loving
patronage that has threatened to burst
the walls of the Tivoli during the past
four weeks with Its attendance. In
presenting this season the management
of the Tivoli has set a new standard
of grand opera in San Erancisco's
home of opera and laid every music
lover under tribute to them for the
splendid performances given
It is putting it very mildly to say
that a success like that achieved by
Tetrazzini has not been witnessed in
San Francisco for many years After
all people love the coloratura song
birds and whenever a cantatrice of Te
trazzini's stamp is revealed the musi
cal enthusiasts flock to hear her The
triumphs of Berllndi have been scarce
ly second to those of Tetrazzini and
there have been no such things as "off
nights" during the present season The
tenors, Bazelll, Frosini and Colli have
all scored heavily an d likewise have
the baritones La Puma and RomboH
Polacco has proved to be a conductor
of rare talent and Goliscianni a maes
tro of unusual merit. The orchestra
has interpreted the works given in a
masterly fashion and it is by Ibng odds
the best grand opera orchestra heard in
San Francisco in years.
The two weeks' extension will un
doubtedly meet with universal ap
proval.
The repertoire for the fifth week will
be chosen from the following operas:

Shows Up in Superb Form.
In a head and neck finish with the
top weight, Venator and Ishlana, an
other light-weighted one, Mrs. James
Blute's bais, a !Â» to T, favorite, captured
the six-furlong handicap at Oakland j
yesterday. The winner was piloted by
"Big Bill" Knapp and outstayed the
Miller hor&e after the latter hid made
all the running. Ishlana would have
cleaned tip but for being can-led out
by Matt Hogan.
The track was heavy, and only two
favorites managed to land. Eusiness
In the ring showed unusual activity
and a large crowd crossed the bay.
From the manner in which Fort
Wayne was played to win the opening
futurity course sprint, one would
naturally come to the conclusion that j
the brown horse had secured a fran- j
chise on the right of way. Perhaps he
did. At any rate, sent to the post fa
vorite, with Willie Daly up, the good |
thing went out and won al] the way.
EPtraza. a live 12 to 1 shot, beat Dr.
Sherman four lenghts for the place.
Although an ordinary bunch of two
year-olds started in the kindergarten
scramble, the finish was one of the best
seen this season. Charley Bell piloted
Abe Meyer, the 1 to 2 choice, and in a
three-heck finish with Southern Lady
and I'm Joe he dropped the first choice
down third. Southern Lady, the win
ner, had "Big Bill" Knapp in the sad
dle and closed in the ring a 9 to 1
shot
Estoy Llsto, an 8 to 1 chance, ridden
by Jakie Jones, took the mile selling

J. Manning, who left the steamship Doric
of; which he was fourth officer, to be" third of
ficer ot the blockade runner " Brinkburn, was
held up Monday night on the water front be
tween Ok Mail dock and Main street. He had

Â»a* trudging elong' through the mud, dodging
chuckholes in the roadway and drear of

Manning reached for the stars, cooled his
fevervd brow against the cold barrel of a pis
tol whfch he declares was eight feet long and
as thick arouruf as the Dorlc"s "back,
while the owner of the voice transferred the
contents of Manning's pockets to his own

When, the ' footpad had annexed S8 75 In

a silver-plated corkscrew and a photograph of
Harry Gaukroger, chief officer of the Doric,
he removed the pistol barrel from Manning's

CONVICT WOOD
HANGS HIMSELF
One of Gang That Took Part
in the Folsom Jail Break
Takes His Life in Dungeon
MAKES ROPE OF BEDDING
Felon Was to Be Executed
for Slaying a Militiaman
During Famous Man Hunt
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â Convict
John H. Wood, who took a prominent
part in the Folsom Prison break in
July, 1903, committed suicide in the
dungeon this afternoon. He was re
cently convicted of the murder of Mi
litiaman Rutherford, whom he shot
and killed during the famous man
hunt.
Wood was confined in a condemned
cell. When seen by the turnkey at 10
o'clock this morning he was all right.
When the turnkey entered the cell at
2 o'clock this afternoon Wood was
found hanging from the ventilator with
a rope tied about his neck. The rope
was made of strips torn from his bed
clothing. The prison physician worked
over Wood for an boar, but was unable
to revive him. Wood was awaiting the
fixing of the date of his hanging.
KPPIXGER GRAIX SUITS
ARE NOT COMPROMISED
! Banks Pail to Reach Afci^ement and
Trial Will Probably Be Resomed
Xext Week.
The expected compromise of the suit
among the dozen banks demanding the
proceeds of the sale of 3500 tons of
Eppinger grain remaining in the
| Crockett warehouse after the failure
did not materialize as expected yester
day and a renewal of the trial of the i
case was set by Judge Murasky for j
next Tuesday. Unless something fa
vorable happens to bring the disagree
| ing interests together before that
time an effort will be made to untangle
' all of the complex claims in court
with fees to be paid to seventeen at- I
torneys.
It is understood that the agreed al
lowance of $12,000 to the American
National Bank, which claimed to have
identified six lots of grain for which It
i held warehouse receipts, was the stick
ing point in the settlement. Mr.
Chickering, attorney for the bank, says
that the others charged that the
American was "a thief" for demand
ing so much. Rather than have the
amount shaved the bank is willing to
fight it out in the expectation of prov
ing: its right to the identified lots.
When the trial of the case was in*.
; terrupted last week with a proposition
: for a compromise the attorneys pres
ent agreed upon* a seemingly satisfac
tory division which gave a portion of
the $102,000 to the banks laying claim I
to specified lots, a portion to those j
wanting a pro rafa division and a
share to Henry W. Wadsro-orth, the
Eppinger trustee in bankruptcy, for
the benefit of all the Eppinger credi
tors. If the litigation is resumed
these three interests will be conflicting.
crr\* losks a point in
SURETY PREMIUM SOT
Judge Troiitt Declares That State
Does Not Govern This
â¢Municipal Affair."
In a written opinion Judge Troutt
yesterday overruled the demurrer of
Auditor Baehr and Treasurer Me-
Dougald to the suit of Julius C. Saul
rnan, wherein, as a taxpayer, he seeks
tn enjoin the payment of a demand for
$1475 by the National Surety Company
for premiums on the official bonds of
the Tax Collector, Auditor, Treasurer,
County Clerk and Sheriff. The defend
ants relied upon the legislative act
providing that bonds of certain pub
lic officials sh^ll be paid by the State,
county or city. There is, however, no
such provision in the San Francisco
charter. Judge Troutt says that as
suming the law to be a general one, is
it such a law that the municipality
must yield to it? If it is a municipal
matter the Legislature cannot author
ize the payment out of the municipal
treasury, and the court says: "L have
no hesitancy in declaring that the pay
ment Â»f the premium is a 'municipal
affair' and beyond the control of the
Legislature. The defendants, are .given
ten days in which to answer the suit.

ciiuM of eorae diKcouragemrtit by contrast
with the universally rarorable view of ye*

not, however, extend th<* depression to the
Vanderbllts. which have hitberto 'mo\-ed' In
rlose sympathy with the Hartimans. >.The
Vand*rbllte sprang Into great animation < and
niade surprising upsjaocts In their prices when
It became ' known that the 'directors of the
varlooa companies -were assembling. The
greatest activity centered In New York Cen

restrained by ecmparlf on with the Junior

five point rise In - Chicago, St. Paul, illnne

accumulaticn of only a few 100-ehare lots, and
the thirty-five point Jump in the preferred

the scarcity of the floating market supply.

Pacific? and Krlos in contraÂ« with recent
buoyancy caused some hesitation' ln the mar
kH. and the general' list was tardy In re- i
sroeding to the Vanderbllt movement.- The
Â«>crexnent In the Vanderbilts seemed to cul
â 
mlnate with the announcement of the reg
ular dividend declaration for the Cleveland,
Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Ixnils stocks.
"he hope of an advance in this dividend rate
was one of -the many suppositions surrounding
the movement In the group. ' The belief that
to â  quarterly statement of United States Steel
earnings to be . given â  during the afternoon
would prove favorable caused a demand . for
United States Steel preferred, and Amalga
mated Copper was also strong." The opening
dip in prices may have been , Influenced to
some extent by the renewal of attention to the
subject of Federal control of railroad â  rates
caused by the President's Philadelphia speech
and by reports of a party agreement on a
Congressional measure. The changes in offi
cials of the Vanderbllt system looking to a
concentration of operation were not' regarded
as adequate explanation for the excited move

are moderately active and firm.

; and Butter generally refused to make any con
cessions, but they were not so stiff as they
I have been for the past fortnight. The r*gu
| lar annnal decline is now due and the ten-
I dency j s to keep as closely sold up as pos*

WATER GAUGES
CITY'S GROWTH
Schussler Tells of Large
Tracts Held by Trustees for
the Spring Valley Company
THIRSTY PERIOD XEAIi
Consumption Will Equal
Full Capacity of Works in
Year From the Present
" Several very - important and interest
ing facts were drawn out of Herman
Schussler by Assistant City and Coun
ty Attorney John C Partridge before j
United States Commissioner Heacock j
yesterday." Mr. Schussler admitted that j
the Spring Valley Water Company had j
purchased ma"ny large tracts of land ,
In this State not listed among its prop- |
erty. One "of these tracts was a piece ;
of 16,000 acres at the base of Mount â¢
Hamilton. AH these outside proper- j
ties were in the hands of trustees, he Â
â¢aid. The company had expended :
$400,000 Upon the Portala reservoir, but j
no water from it was ever taken to j
Ean Francisco. The Portala system <
could bring ten million gallons of wa- ,
ter per da v to San Francisco at an ex- j
pense of one million dollars, but this i
property had ne>r been utilized for
that purpose because the company had j
not entire control of the watershed
and could not depend upon the quality '

Faithless Juanita Potalis Jilts
Emilio Santos.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
When Juanita Potalis and Julia Davis
contended for the smiles of Juan Es
crodito, picador, one day last week,
their combat and arrest conveyed an
guish to the soul of Emilio Santos,
who had fondly believed himself to
be sole possessor of Juanita's love. So
artfully had ttfe Castilian beauty dis
sembled her admiration for the dash
ing prodder of bulls that the revela
tion of her fickleness almost prostrat-
Ed Emilio. He tried to delude himself I
into belief that a mistake must be
concealed somewhere â that th^ Juan
ita who had plighted her troth to him
was inveigled into the fight by her
adversary to -serve gome mysterious \
purpose â -but tht- court proceedings i
completed his dipniusionment. There j
was no error about it â Juanita had
systematically played her fiance falso.
She confessed her infatuation for an
other to the Senor Judge Mogan.
With the revelation of Juanita's
perfidy there came to Emilio the thirst'
for gore that is characteristic of the '
jilted Spaniard. Irrespective of sex.
Racial instinct urged him *o apply hls^
knife to Juanita, but as? she was in â 
jail he ''ouM not glut his vengeance in '.
that direction and he was too impa- '
tient to, await her restoration to lib- '
erty. So he transferred his murderous j
intent to the man whr> ha<i won her |
adoration. The father of the picador
kept a restaurant in Hinckley place ;
and it was there Emilio went in quest :
of blood. A person less agile than !
Juan, or one less piven to guarding |
against sudden onslaughts in the bull- !
ring, would surely have perished Â«t
the hands of Emilio. As it was, Juan
managed to keep himself from being
carved soleK- by means of his nimble
footwork. As he had often eluded
maddened toro, so did he dodge the ;
frenzied Emilio and kept him- well at
bay until the police arrived.
Juan appeared before the same
Penor Judge Mogan and drove home
his complaint against Emilio, who was
pronounced guilty of assault with in
tent to kill and given three months'
imprisonment. Them a curious thing |
happened. The feminine rivals for
Juan's favor sat side by side awaiting j
trial for fighting, and when he ap
proached the, bench to testify they
gazed upon him and gasped. But their
gasp was not the tremulous ebullition
of love. It waf. rather, the breath in
t;ikr> compelled by surprise and dis
appointment. Nor was that all they
did. Rising simultaneously and ad
dressing the court they declared that |
they did not then and never would i
again harbor affection for Juan Es- i
crodito and they were sorry they had I
ever given him more than one passing
thought.
"What's the matter?" eagerly whis
pered Bailiff Hickey.
"Look at his head," was Juanita's
answer.
"He's bald." said Julia.
"Ifs the first time I ever saw him
with his hat off," rejoined Juanita.
"I used to wonder why he always
kept his head covered," remarked Ju- I
Ua,
Then they were pronounced guilty j
of peace disturbance and remanded j
for sentence.

It was the early closing movement
on the Barbary Coast that drove Miss
Mary Anderson to vagrancy, she de
clared. Possessor of a soprano voice oÂ£
biidy ciuality, lofty pitch and wide
compass, which she had cultivated un
til her singing of "Alexander" was
worth going miles to hear, she lost her
position in a Pacific-street music hall
when the police insisted on closing the
doors at f o'clock, thus reducing the
proprietor's t income and necessitating
curtailment of his expenditures. Un
able to obtain another engagement as
a vocalist, she was obliged to resort to
dancing for a livelihood, but as Terp
sichore had been ignored in hfer artistic
training there was no demand for her
as a partner while any otfcer danseuse
was available, so she became despond
ent and bibulous. Judge Mogan has
her story under consideration.
When the detective assigned to trace
the ; stolen beer and arrest its purloin
ers entered , the apartment Jointly
rented by John Murray \ and William
Strahan, professional mendicants, he
knew that his quest was ended. There
lay. the missing thirty-nine empty
quart bottles and there lay John and
William in condition equivalent to con
fession that the beverage had been
transferred from the glass receptacles
to their interiors. Wading through the
bottles the sleuth made closer exam
ination of the recumbent tipplers and
found that they could safely ,be - re
moved to prison instead of to the
Emergency Hospital. They were drunk,
but capable of speech, and they hailed
their discoverer as if he were an old
friend who had dropped in to . make
a 'social call, v '.*\ h '

sentenced them to six months' Im
prisonment.

STUFFER WYMAN
IS SENTENCED
Will Spend the Next Three
Years Within Confines of
San Quentin Penitentiary
APPEAL NOTICE GIVEN
Motions for New Trial and
for Arrest of Judgment De
nied and Bail Is Kefused
Charles Wyman, convicted of fraud- j
ulently voting at the last primary elec
tion, was sentenced by Judge Lawlor
yesterday to serve three years in San
Quentin. Notice of appeal to the Su- ;
preme Court was given. An applica- :
tion to admit the defendant to bail
was denied.
When the case was called, Attorney
Countryman filed two affidavits on his
motion for a new trial. One was by
Attorney David E. Alarchus, who was
a clerk at a polling booth opposite a
house on Tenth avenue, Sunset Dis
trict, who averred that about five min
utes past 4 o'clock on the afternoon
of August 9, the day of the election,
he saw Wyman, accompanied by a
youth, enter the booth. They had
'driven up in a buggy and Wyman,
after making inquiry as to how the
voting was going, left, saying he was
going to the booth at the Alms House.
This was to prove an alibi.
The other affidavit was by the de- |
fendant, who averred that he was be
ing prosecuted for political purposes
and that certain editorials, likewise
garbled accounts of the proceedings in
the courts, had influenced the minds of
the JHidge and jury. He also averred
that further evidence as to an alibi
had been found.
Assistant District Attorney Ferral
said he had no counter affidavits to
submit, and- Attorney Countryman
asked that the Judge and Attorneys
Wright and Hbsmer be called to tes
; tify as to an alleged consultation in
' the Judge's chambers, prior to the
Judge'e charge to the jury. This was
i said to be on the last day of the trial
: and to have been regarding the in
1 structions to be given to the jury. A* â 
! torney Hosmer objected that such tes
i timony could not be given on a motion
j for a new trial, and the Judge agreed
' with him.
The motion for a new trial was then
; submitted without argument, and was
i promptly denied. A motion for arrest
: of judgment on sixteen grounds was
made. Denied.
In passing sentence the Judge said
i the penalty for the crime was not ex
ceeding five years. He had occupied
! himself in an effort to determine what
motive prompted Â« the defendant to
; commit the act of which he had been
' convicted, but he had not been able, to
, his own satisfaction, to appreciate any
; motive residing within the defendant
i himself to commit such an act. The
j defendant did not take the stand, so
' that his version of what took place
within the polling booth was not ob
\ tamed. The court would take into con
; sideration the fact that he had to ae
j Bume the previous good character and
antecedents of the defendant, and
would adopt the view that .the ccr r
talnty of punishment In a case of this
| character, where the integrity of pub
1 He elections was involved, was of quite
| as much importance as the extent of
| such punishment.
EDNA WAIJ/ACE HOPPER
MAKES HURRIED VISIT
necessity for Actress' Appearance In
Dunsmnir Hearing Nearly Prevents
Her Playing In Sacramento.
The disp^es of the attorneys in the
Dunsmuir casÂ«, before British Consul
Bennett yesterday, were such thmat it
was found that the presence of Edna
Wallace Hopper alone could untangle
the auestiona involved.
Word was at once sfent to Mrs.
Hopper, who was playing Monday
night in San Jose, to come to the con
sulate in this city immediately. When
the message arrived the company had
left en route to Sacramento, where
they were due to play last night.
Mrs. Hopper came through on the
regular train and was at. the hearing
yesterday afternoon, while the com
pany procQ/pded to Sacramento. At
the conclusion of the hearing a spe*
cial train was hastily mads up and the
actress rushed to the capital city just
in time to make her appearance with
out delaying the performers.
Attorney Wheeler asked that his
criticism of Sir Charles H. Tupper be
expunged fro-m the court's records, as
in his remarks he intended to convey
nothing of a personal nature against
the attorney for Mrs. Hopper. He
merely wished to be understood as
saying that the witness, J. J. Dwyer,
whom Sir Charles was examining, was
under oath and the Questioner was
not.
This statement pleased all the law
yers present and E. V. Bodwell, who
has had Dwyer under cross-examina
tion, proceeded more leniently with
his questioning. Late in the afternoon
Attorney Wheeler took up the re
cross-examination of Dwyer, which
â¢will finish the latter's testimony. This
allowed Dwyer to review some of his
statements and make corrections and
alterations of mistakes that might
result in transcription.

rible state of the road necessitated su"h
severe physical exertion on its part
that when it arrived In town it was

Will Contest Brews In Jail.
John Henry Rea, who does not ex
plain whether he is a prisoner or a
deputy in the County Jail at Bakers
field, has written to County Clerk
John Greif asking for a postponement
of the probate proceeding's in the mat
ter of his father's will, now on the
calendar for February 8. Rea says,
"I am in a predicament that I cannot
appear on the Bth of February, but I
can be there on the 15th. So if you
will postpone the case I will be very
much obliged, aa I intend to contest
the will." Henry Lee Rea, the father,
died on November 8 last, leaving lots
in Richmond district valued at $1200.
He left $100 each to his son and
daughter and the remainder of the
estate to his wife, who has applied
for letters of administration.
BROTHERS NOW
ACCUSE SISTERS
Jacob and Samuel Fischer
Say Mother Depleted Her
Estate by Her Kindness
GENEEOUS TO HER GIKLS
Affidavits in Answer to a De
mand that Executors Give
Bonds Tell the Story
A preliminary to the pending con- |
test of the will of the late Rosalia |
Fischer, in which two sisters are ar- !
rayed against two brothers, was partly !
heard yesterday in Judge Coffey's i
court and adjourned for a week. The ;
daughters, Augusta and Hannah Sam- |
ter, who are contesting the will, ap- \
plied to the court for an order putting ;
tire sons, Jacob A. and Samuel A.
Fischer, under bonds as adminlstra- j
tors of the estate, although the will i
provided that they should act with- |
out bonds. Augusta Samter's affidavit :
charged that Jacob was of a specula- i
tive turn, had no business of his own, <
and was liable to use the moneys of I
the estate in further doubtful yen- j
tures.. It was also charged that Sam- j
uel is under Jacob's domination.
The brothers were in court and an- !
severed the charges with two interest- !
ing affidavits of their own, which were i
read by Attorney I. M. Kalloch. They J
told another version of the story that j
they had used their mother's money ]
in bad speculation and had depleted j
her estate until the $125,000 she re
ceived from her husband fifteen years
ago had dwindled to $32,000 in addi
tion to notes for $ 52,000 owed by Ja
cob.
Jacob draws a distinction between
speculation and investment and ad
mits that he is an investor, and as to
having a business, he says his time is
demanded by the duties of his office
as president of the Golden Gate Gold
and Sulphuret Mining and Develop
ment Company.
Often, he says, he realized great
profits for his mother in making in
vestments for her; he cites a profit
of $17,000 on the sale of her shares
in the Dinsmore mine, and $3800 in
a deal in Monte Cristo Oil stock. Her
losses in another mining .venture, he
I explains, were caused by unjust liti
gation against the company,
i As to the evident depletion of the
i estate, he says it is to be blamed upon
j the daughters aird their families. The
mother had been liberal to the daugh
ters. It is said that Augusta's family
was living in straitened circumstances
in Memphis, Term., when the mother
sent for her, her husband and five
children, paid their expenses to Cali
fornia, took them into her home, sSp
: ported them and gave Marks Samter
$3000 to go into business, which he
proceeded to lose. In return for this
kindness they are charged with abus
ing the old lady until they made her

In New Construction.
That building operations will be very
brisk during 1905 was demonstrated
by figures compiled yesterday in the
Bureau of Buildings, showing that 177
mw stHfetures were projected in Jan
uary at an an estimated cost of $1,202,
301. This is an increase over opera
tions for December, 1904. when they
were $1,187,765, and almost double
those of January, 1904. when the cost
of new buifdings was only $656,371.
The alterations to fifty old buildings
during last month aggregated $153,860,
or a grand total of $1,356,161 in con
struction for January, 1905. There
vere 187 free permits issu*d for altera
tions, costing $36,608, in amounts of
less than $500 each. â 
The fees received during the month
amounted to $1666. against $1481 for
December. There were seventeen ap
