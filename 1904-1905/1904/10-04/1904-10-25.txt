WILD RIDE OF A LUNATIC
LONDON, Oct. 24. â Great Britain
to-day sent a long and urgent note to
the Russian Government, officially de
tailing the circumstances of the amaz
ing and unexplained attack by the
Russian Second Pacific squadron dur
ing the night of October 21 on British
fishing: boats in the North Sea. The
text of the note has not been given out,
itut-^t - is-^jra^rany : stat*Â«i* troTTi *Â¦ the
Foreign Office that it contains the slg- '
niflcant announcement that "the situa-,
tion Is one which, in the opinion of his
Majesty's Goverment, does not brook
delay."
Meanwhile, the conservative public
and press are remarkably undemon
strative. As usual the jingo element
demands war and even in official quar
ters some go so far as to say that It
may be necessary to stop the Pacific
fleet pending settlement of the whole
affair, though this extreme measure,
it is believed, will not be necessary.
Everywhere there is - evidence of the
very positive opinion that this is no
time for the usual diplomatic dilly
dallying: that there must be no delay
and no limit set by Russia to her apol
ogy or the extent of- compensation for
eufferers by what King Edward him
self terms "the unwarranted action"
Of the Baltic. squadron commanders.
KING EXPRESSES SORROW.
The King sent the following mes
sage to the Mayor of Hull:
"From Francis Knollys, Bucking
ham Palace. October 24, 1904. To His'
Worship, the Mayor of Hull: The
King commands me to say that he has
heard with profound sorrow of the
unwarrantable action which has been
committed against the North Sea fish
ing fleet and ask you to express the
deepest sympathy of the Queen and
his Majesty to. the families of those
â¢who have suffered from this most la
mentable occurrence. KNOL.L.YS."
Francis Knollys, Baron of Favor-
Fham, Is the private secretary of King
Edward.
The deep resentment of tire whole
British public, however. Is reflected by
the . Incident at the Victoria station
to-night on the arrival of Count
Benckendorff from the Continent.
There is no attempt anywhere among
men of responsibility to magnify the
occurrence Into a deliberate act of
â¢war, but in view of the present inabil
ity to find an explanation there is be
ing poured upon the heads of the offi
cers of the sauadron a flood of invect
ive and insinuation, though incompe
tence first and thereafter complete
panic Is the most generally accepted
explanation.
"SO WORD FROM ST. PETERSBURG
Thus far no official word has been
received from St. Petersburg as to the
attitude of the Russian Government.
The fact that it had been decided dur
ing the day to prepare a Bemi-official
note expressing the regret of the Rus
elan Government and its willingness
to make full reparation so soon aa the
responsibility is fixed was communi
cated by the press to Lord Lansdowne
and was the first information on the
subject he had received 'from St
Petersburg. The absence during the
day of Count Benckendorff, the Rus
elan Embassador, necessarily caused
some delay, but the Russian Charge
d' Affaires, who called at the Foreign
Office on request by note from Lord
Lansdowne, unofficially expressed deep
regret and, cs far as it was possible
for him to go, gave assurance' of speedy
action by the Russian Government.
Lord Lansdowne, in this Interview, told
Bansonoff, the Charge, that he desired
to Bee Embassador Benckendorff on
Tuesday, morning. Lord Lansdowne
asked if he could offer any
explanation of the, affair and the lat
ter replied that he only knew what had
appeared in the papers and that he
had' not received any word up to* that
time from St. Petersburg. Lord Lans
idowne grave, no euggestlon as to what
might be done in the matter.
RUSSIA'S COURSE IS PLAIN.

stated that "the whole affair .was so
obviously a mistake, from ' whatever
cause, that Russia's course was plain

The attack on the trawlers, the Pall
Mall Gazette says, "affords proof pos
itive that the Russian squadron is a
dangerous lunatic and a terror to all in
its Â¦wicinity." â¢
, The phenomenon of a sudden panic, espe
cially at night. Is well known. It 1* a tem
porary Insanity which may seize even vet
eran soldiers and eallore in peaceful transit
of the high ffas and consequently is to be
treated as Â«uch. ThÂ» British Government,
however, cannot run the risk of the repetition
of an outrage which might send a Me liner
full of men, women and children to the bot
tom of the e*a. It ie possible for the British
Government to give orders that for the rest
of Us voyage the Rusdan squadron shall be
accompanied and shepherded by British war
ships, whose duty it will be to steady the
JiTT.ee of the Russian admiral by a clear In
timation that. the first ehot fired at a British
vessel will be regarded as an act of war.
Not only must Russia make an humble apology,
but England must . employ the . material force
of her sea power to provide that there be no
repetition of this intolerable offense. â¢

The Pall Mall Gazette said editorial
ly this afternoon:
The actual casualties during the one
sided bombardment off Dog'ger Bank
can be correctly stated since the arri
val at London this evening of the car
rying,>hip Swift, reporting the safety
of the missing trawlers. The Swift
left the fleet &u 10 a. m. on October 23.
Her captain says:
"The Russians gave not the slightest
warning prior to the commencement of
the firing. The admiral of the fishing
fleet sent up a rocket of warning and
then the firing commenced. He again
sent up four green rockets, but this
only seemed to increase the ferocity of
the bombardment. The poor marks
manship of the Russian gunners was
the only thing that saved the entire
fleet within range of the searchlights
and guns."
At the inquest at Hull to-day It was
stated that one vessel, the Crane, was
sunk and that four or five were more
or less damaged. In the statement of
the Coroner to the jury that official
caid it was a question of very grave
and possibly international importance,
but it would be their duty to find who
were the murderers of the dead men.
After the identification of the bodies
the inquest adjourned to November 2.

Special Dispatch to The Call,
Yesterday Commons and Mrs. Bell were seen at "The Buckingham," a
lodging-house, but to-day they are in hiding. Mrs. Rhoda Bell is the wife
of Joseph Bell and was prominent in Windsor. . She has a daughter 8 years
of aÂ£e there. Commons was a friend of Bell and a frequent caller at the
house, and there he conceived and declared his affection ; for Mrs. Bell and
found it reciprocated. Bell found it out and drove Commons away with
a gun, friends barely saving the contractor's life. Bell had Commons and
Mrs. Bell arrested on a serious charge, but friends again intervened.
The affair was hushed up on the contractor's promise to keep away,
which he didn't keep.
As a sensational windup of the disgraceful romance. Commons collected
his wife's life insurance of $2000, sold his home for $2300, drew what savings
he had In the bank and deliberately decamped with Mrs. Bell, their destina
tion being unknown until they were discovered In this city.
It is said Bell has sworn to kill the destroyer of his home on sight and to
follow him to the end of the earth If necessary to do so.
LOS ANGELES, . Oct. 24.â James Commons, a wealthy Detroit contrac
tor, and Mrs. Joseph Bell, the principals in an. international elopement that
scandalized the East, have been traced to this 1 " city. If Commons thought

that Rojestvensky is - too good a man
and officer to be summarily condemned.
It is agreed that he is entitled to ' a
hearing, but even the Admiralty
gretfully admits that it is at a loss
to understand what explanation could
Justify such an apparently coldblooded
act as the affair is made to appear by
foreign reports. ; * '
It developed during the day. that the
Admiralty had strong reason to believe
that an attempt would be made against
the squadron â¢ during its passage
through the Great Belt or \he English
Channel. So specific was the Informa
tion that â¢ even the present : crisis I haa
not diverted attention from the -'pos
sibility of such an attack yet occurring.
The failure of the steam trawlers, with
their nets out, to obey the signals from
the Russian warships or the nervous
ness of some officer who imagined that
fishermen, working with their nets in
the water were laying mines may have
been responsible for the blunder.- * ':
As soon as the facts are established
It is certain that the Russian Govern
ment will voluntarily offer the ' fullest
reparation. , It. Is hinted that the Em
peror to-morrow will ; send a formal
message to King Edward conveying
his profound sorrow, for the , incident

to being subsequently placed there."
The articles referred to are a fish

This plan of the Russians,; to en
trench as they ad.vance, was adopted
because it was found in. the recent big
battle that it impossible to , ad

face of the Japanese shrapnel fire.
The Russian batteries are now bet
ter screened thanv they were in former
engagements,; but the troops on both
sides, apparently, make no great ef
forts to conceal themselves.
The/ Russian and Jrpanese armies
are now separated by less than four
miles and the whole field of operations
of both armies "can be plainly seen.
The; question of fuel is becoming a
serious one. ' The greater part of the

opposed as waa 1 Count Lamsfiorft to

There Is no doubt that Count-Benck

Mob's Action
Complicates
Situation
"No particular significance -attaches
to the departure of these thirty or
forty Japanese," said Consul Uyeno
last night "It does v not mean that
Japan . Is running short of . . men at
home. On the contrary, the number
of men* 2 available for arms is many
times â¢ that 'of ; the : present .number In
the field. Owing to the arrangement
of divisions in' the reserve forces these
men who will 'sail to-morroyr are en
titled to go to the war before others
at home and the Government is giving
them the opportunity of service they
are ( so Â¦ eagerly - seeking. There are
about: 30,000 Japanese on tl%s Pacific
Coast and to a man they are feverish

to Japan and go to the front. Â«
"The total number of Japanese who
have left San Francisco to fight for
their country Is not more than 200.
Several small delegations have gone
forward." v
Between thirty 'and'forty Japanese
will sail on the China to-day, bound
for their native land to take up arms

left Japan friends and relatives
vouched for their return should the

Both armies are heavily entrenching

believed Kuropatkin will order

ment, unless heavy Japanese reinforce
ments compel him to resume the defen
sive. Reports that Japanese" reinforce
ments are arriving, taken in connection
with *the enforced Inactivity' of 1 the
Russian forces on account of the
weather, are felt to be a Â¦ grave factor
In the situation. There Is reason to
believe that the Japanese are drawing
heavily on- the Port Arthur army, as
well as upon Japan, in the hope of ob

will enable' Field Marshal Oyama to in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
Washington. Oct. 24.â The firing
upon the British trawling Yleet by the
Russian Baltic squadron may. develop
Into a, more serious incident than was
ct first regarded as probable. The af
fair* was officially brought before the
Btate Department to-day by a report
fiom \V. C. Hamm. the Consul at Hull,
in which he .Confirmed the press dis
patches and told of the intense excite
ment in England. Later in the day
there was unofficial inquiry from the
British Government as to the American
view of the case and .an informal sug
gestion for joint action under certain
conditions. The British Government
considers that it is a question for the
nations to decide whether, in the In
terests of neutral commerce and to pre
vtfet the possibility of further slaugh
ter of neutrals, it Is not advisable for
the powers to stop the progress of the
Baltic fleet, on account of its misman
agement and the incompetence and
panic-stricken condition of its officers.
It is not certain, according to the
Information in Washington, that even
a prompt apology from Russia, with
full reparation and a promise that the
incident will not be repeated, will
change this view of the case, for the
British Government is thoroughly
aroused to the danger of a continuance
of such stupidity as was displayed by
the Russians in the North Sea. There
is every indication that if England was
assured of the support of other neutral
powers she would hold the Russian
fit-et up. either at Gibraltar or at the
entrance of the Suez canal, and com
pel it to return to Russian waters,
v here it would be out of the way of
doins further harm-
This is the feature of the affair which
Is being considered to-night by the
State Department officials. They be
lieve that the question which has been
informally brought up by England is
likely soon to be raised officially and
they are in doubt as to just what an
ewer to grive.
Secretary Hay is worried by the fear
that the incident will take a very se
rious turn and depressed by the danger
that all of his efforts to localize the
war will go for naught. . If there is
gtfofl 'ground for the Russian "fear that
the fleet will be intercepted by Jap
anese submarines, or torpedo boats long
before it reaches its destination, with
fighting far outside of the zone to
which it was agreed to confine hostili
ties, there is no: telling where the
spread of the war will end, in the opin
ion of Hay.
Under the conditions which have re
suited from the North Sea episode. Hay
does not regard a general European
war as nearly so much of an impos
sibility as he -did before. If England:
should assume an attitude ef open
hostility to Russia, the Czar would im
mediately call on France to join forces
with Russia, under the terms of their!
offensive and defensive treaty. This'
probably would drag Germany into the '
conflict, for there seems to be a secret
understanding between the Czar- and
the Kaiser that is very complete.

: When a woman haa been bid that to
save her life It will be necessary for her
to undergo a dangerous surgical opera,
tion. especially when two nell-knowa
hospital doctors* agree that an operation
is the only helpâ to be quickly, thorough-
ly and painlessly cured at a trfling ex-
pense, such a woman must surely bÂ«
grateful. ."Well, .-the . Electro-Chemlc
treatment has cured me after I Dad suf-
fered untold misery for seven yeirs and
aftÂ«r two of the best family phyiidans
in San Francisco had told ma thit tha
only, thing tnat would save .my life
would be a surgical operation. X am
happy and grateful to the Eleetro-
Chemlc specialists for my cure, and X
want every suffering woman to know ot
this wonderful - new treatment â so pain-
less â so pleasant â so quick in its effect*
-and so cheap. My case was on a of thosÂ«
distressing ovarian troubles. Tumors had
! all formed and the pains in the lower ab-
domen were awful. The pains and weak-
ness in my back at times were almost
unbearable. I was dizzy, I could not
eat, I was sick at my stomach and at
times could not sleep. My picture at tha
top of this article is quite good.- My
name is Mrs. E. W. Suttle and I live at
No. 132 Perry "street. Ban Francifco. Any
one Interested in my wonderful' cur* la
.at liberty to call on mo for further par-
ticulars. . , â¢
If -Electro-Chemistry had accomplished
nothing else but tha cure of; suffering
women, keeping them off of the operating
table. It would take a first- place amongst
the greatest of modern discoveries as a
curative agent, but Electro-Chemistry Is
the moat aueceaaful treatment now In
use for .the cure of Consumption. Ca-
tarrh. Asthma, Bronchitis. Rheumatism.

The Electro-Chemlc examination is tin
most reliable examination that any suf-
ferer can have. Such an examination
will quickly ahow whether a caaÂ« la cura-
ble or not. and this examination la now
absolutely free to.any sufferer applying
at tha Institute for It. The Electro-
Chemle Institute occupies nearly the
whole first floor of the large building at
US Grant avenue, corner of Post street.
The- office hours are from nine to five
and from seven to eight, daily, and from
ten to one on Sundays. There are re-
tired and private apartments set aside
for the male and female patients. The
Klectro-Chemic Institute is the only In-
stitution on the Pacific Coast doing thla
work. The office is centrally located at
118 Grant avenue, and persons desiring
to consult the Electro-Chemlc specialists
will do well to make no mistake regard-
ing the place.
The Klectro-Chemle bom* treatment Is
very successful and patienta who are
aick and who live at a distance should
try to come for personal examination
when possible, when this can not Be
done," a "abort -description - of principal
symptoms, should be sent in and full In-
structions regarding > examination and a
home course of the treatment will be
promptly forwarded, free of charge.

ternpt been made to Justify the firing
upon " inndcent fishermen. Â¦' It" is felt
that Rojestvensky is - too good a man
and officer to be summarily condemned.
It is agreed that he is entitled to ' a
hearing, but even the Admiralty
gretfully admits that it is at a loss
to understand what explanation could
Justify such an apparently coldblooded
act as the affair is made to appear by
foreign reports. ; * '
It developed during the day. that the
Admiralty had strong reason to believe
that an attempt would be made against
the squadron â¢ during its passage
through the Great Belt or \he English
Channel. So specific was the Informa
tion that â¢ even the present : crisis I haa
not diverted attention from the -'pos
sibility of such an attack yet occurring.
The failure of the steam trawlers, with
their nets out, to obey the signals from
the Russian warships or the nervous
ness of some officer who imagined that
fishermen, working with their nets in
the water were laying mines may have
been responsible for the blunder.- * ':
As soon as the facts are established
It is certain that the Russian Govern
ment will voluntarily offer the ' fullest
reparation. , It. Is hinted that the Em
peror to-morrow will ; send a formal
message to King Edward conveying
his profound sorrow, for the , incident
and offering . to make what .reparation
is possible as soon as the responsibility
can be fixed. These advance % assur
ances, it is hoped, will be; met â¢ in an
amicable spirit by Great Britain. â¢,?..
LONDON, Oct 24.â In order that
there, should be no possible Â«error re
garding the"- peaceful occupation of the
flshermen'killed^byrthe fire, from the
Russian warships in the North' Sea, the
Foreign iOBice has communicated to
the Hull Coroner a request that "the
bodies from the Crane should be photo
graphed and unimpeachable medical
testimony . called to show that the
grasp of articles in the dead men's
hands was due to rigor mortis and not
to being subsequently placed there."
The articles referred to are a fish
and a knife found in the hands of the
dead captain of the Crane. "
It is understood that the Government
also has invited the Russian Embassy
to send medical men 'to -examine the
bodies.

This plan of the Russians,; to en
trench as they ad.vance, was adopted
because it was found in. the recent big
battle that it impossible to , ad
vance . without some protection in the
face of the Japanese shrapnel fire.
The Russian batteries are now bet
ter screened thanv they were in former
engagements,; but the troops on both
sides, apparently, make no great ef
forts to conceal themselves.
The/ Russian and Jrpanese armies
are now separated by less than four
miles and the whole field of operations
of both armies "can be plainly seen.
The; question of fuel is becoming a
serious one. ' The greater part of the
Chinese corn* has already been used for
fuel and for fodder, while most of the
houses in. the ; Chinese villages have
been destroyed and their wood used for
fuel. Without fuel and without shelter
beyond .that provided by tents,- it
seems Impossible for the armies, to re
main in the field during, the Increasing

MUKDEN, Oct. 24.â The Russian^

. ."The attack on the trawlers was ob
viously, either an act of war or a great
mistake. No sensible man. can' now
think It : was an act of war, and there
fore it was a mistake, and ; when 1 you
have made a mistake all "you 'can do is

With such vigilance did they carry
out their task that when Prince Svlato
polk-MIrsky, a cousin of the new Rus
sian Minister of the | Interior and sec
ond secretary^ of the embassy, arrived
he -had hard work getting in. Count
Benckendorff- had telegraphed to him
to come to the embassy to write a long
cipher message to St: Petersburg de
scribing to-nightts hostile demonstra
tion. : In reply to a request for some
statement to the press the Embassador
sent word that he could 1 say; nothing,
but ; it was gathered that he had sent
a dispatch to St. Petersburg which may
add .to the existing delicacy of the
situation. Prince \ Svlatopolk-Mlrsky

LONDON, Oct. 24.â Count Bencken
dorff, the Russian Embassador, re
turned; to London -to-night from cele
brating his silver wedding anniversary
with his wife's relatives In Silesia and
barely escaped assault from a crowd
at the Victoria station, which followed
him almost into the embassy. Fortu
nately for the issue of peace or war
nothing resulted; yet, throughout the
night, a. special force of police,, was
compelled to guard' the Russian em
bassy.
Count Benckendorff has been always
regarded J in official circles, here as a
friend of peace > and he was as much
opposed as waa 1 Count Lamsfiorft to
the Russo-Japanese war. . Indeed, he

There Is no doubt that Count-Benck
endorff was deeply hurt by :to-nighfs
demonstration. "After escaping from
the hostile .'crowd that met 1 him â¢ at .the
station he drove at a gallop-* to ".the

lowed, but the Embassador arrived un
harmed." 'His' noisy pursuers encount

the disturbers dispersed,- no arrests be

guard the embassy as if it were a

Mob's Action
Complicates
Situation
"No particular significance -attaches
to the departure of these thirty or
forty Japanese," said Consul Uyeno
last night "It does v not mean that
Japan . Is running short of . . men at
home. On the contrary, the number
of men* 2 available for arms is many
times â¢ that 'of ; the : present .number In
the field. Owing to the arrangement
of divisions in' the reserve forces these
men who will 'sail to-morroyr are en
titled to go to the war before others
at home and the Government is giving
them the opportunity of service they
are ( so Â¦ eagerly - seeking. There are
about: 30,000 Japanese on tl%s Pacific
Coast and to a man they are feverish
ly wishing for the chance to -return
to Japan and go to the front. Â«
"The total number of Japanese who
have left San Francisco to fight for
their country Is not more than 200.
Several small delegations have gone
forward." v
Between thirty 'and'forty Japanese
will sail on the China to-day, bound
for their native land to take up arms
in the war , with i Russia. When they
left Japan friends and relatives
vouched for their return should the
country ever need their . services In
the army and in obedience to notifica
tions this delegation from * the Pacific
Coast has ..prepared . for . Its long trip
to perform the duty of patriotism.
Japanese to Sail for Native Land TV^
Day to Join Army.
Â¦ ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 24.â The
Czar has again given General Kuropat
kln the order that Port Arthur must be
reached at any price. The^ coming
struggle, '.-when word l^to advance is
given, is sure to be far more obstinate
and bloodthirsty than . the .last. ' The
Harbin'* hospitals 'are being again
clearedrand \ the \ occupants sent , forth.
K correspondent from the frontways
the . enemy is so close that if even a
head is shown it is a signal for a hun
dred rifle shots. ' ' -. -
The order for" mobilization in March
calls for 300,000 .troops, also; all -the re
serve officers in the empire. .
I am told that Kaulbars has refused
to command the first army. â¢ ,' >
Both armies are heavily entrenching
along the Shakhe River, although It is
believed Kuropatkin will order
the forward movement at an early mo
ment, unless heavy Japanese reinforce
ments compel him to resume the defen
sive. Reports that Japanese" reinforce
ments are arriving, taken in connection
with *the enforced Inactivity' of 1 the
Russian forces on account of the
weather, are felt to be a Â¦ grave factor
In the situation. There Is reason to
believe that the Japanese are drawing
heavily on- the Port Arthur army, as
well as upon Japan, in the hope of ob
taining a numerical superiority, that
will enable' Field Marshal Oyama to in
flict a crushing blow upon Genecal Ku
ropatkin when hostilities are resumed.
. . Emperor ' Nicholas has received the
following dispatch from General Kuro
patkin, dated October 23 :.
v"The night of October .22-23 passed
quietly. At 9 o'clock this morning the
whole of our volunteer sharpshooters
harassed the enemy, while the Japan
ese tried to attack our : outftosts, but
were everywhere repulsed by the Rus

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
Washington. Oct. 24.â The firing
upon the British trawling Yleet by the
Russian Baltic squadron may. develop
Into a, more serious incident than was
ct first regarded as probable. The af
fair* was officially brought before the
Btate Department to-day by a report
fiom \V. C. Hamm. the Consul at Hull,
in which he .Confirmed the press dis
patches and told of the intense excite
ment in England. Later in the day
there was unofficial inquiry from the
British Government as to the American
view of the case and .an informal sug
gestion for joint action under certain
conditions. The British Government
considers that it is a question for the
nations to decide whether, in the In
terests of neutral commerce and to pre
vtfet the possibility of further slaugh
ter of neutrals, it Is not advisable for
the powers to stop the progress of the
Baltic fleet, on account of its misman
agement and the incompetence and
panic-stricken condition of its officers.
It is not certain, according to the
Information in Washington, that even
a prompt apology from Russia, with
full reparation and a promise that the
incident will not be repeated, will
change this view of the case, for the
British Government is thoroughly
aroused to the danger of a continuance
of such stupidity as was displayed by
the Russians in the North Sea. There
is every indication that if England was
assured of the support of other neutral
powers she would hold the Russian
fit-et up. either at Gibraltar or at the
entrance of the Suez canal, and com
pel it to return to Russian waters,
v here it would be out of the way of
doins further harm-
This is the feature of the affair which
Is being considered to-night by the
State Department officials. They be
lieve that the question which has been
informally brought up by England is
likely soon to be raised officially and
they are in doubt as to just what an
ewer to grive.
Secretary Hay is worried by the fear
that the incident will take a very se
rious turn and depressed by the danger
that all of his efforts to localize the
war will go for naught. . If there is
gtfofl 'ground for the Russian "fear that
the fleet will be intercepted by Jap
anese submarines, or torpedo boats long
before it reaches its destination, with
fighting far outside of the zone to
which it was agreed to confine hostili
ties, there is no: telling where the
spread of the war will end, in the opin
ion of Hay.
Under the conditions which have re
suited from the North Sea episode. Hay
does not regard a general European
war as nearly so much of an impos
sibility as he -did before. If England:
should assume an attitude ef open
hostility to Russia, the Czar would im
mediately call on France to join forces
with Russia, under the terms of their!
offensive and defensive treaty. This'
probably would drag Germany into the '
conflict, for there seems to be a secret
understanding between the Czar- and
the Kaiser that is very complete.

11:30 o'clock to-night the 'Admiralty
announced that it had not yet received
a report.
At the same hour the Foreigrn Office
issued a statement expressing the re
grets of the Government for the de
plorable incident, but explaining that
no formal action was possible until
Admiral Rojestvensky'a official report
of the affair had been received.
The purpose- of the Government to
make amends, if Rojestvensky shall be
found to have been in fiftilt, has been
proclaimed in every Government de
partment. Emperor: Nicholas himself
was greatly aggrieved' when he heard
the news, while he. was inspecting the
cruiser Oreg at "Kronstadt this after
noon, aifa Foreign Minister. Lamsclorff
expressed to Embassador Hardinge his
deepest" personal regrets.
The Russian embassy in London also
has been directed to convey similar ex
pressions to the' Government of Great
Britain. It is felt that this is, all that
can possibly be done, pending, the re-'
ceipt of Admiral Rojestvensky's state

: When a woman haa been bid that to
save her life It will be necessary for her
to undergo a dangerous surgical opera,
tion. especially when two nell-knowa
hospital doctors* agree that an operation
is the only helpâ to be quickly, thorough-
ly and painlessly cured at a trfling ex-
pense, such a woman must surely bÂ«
grateful. ."Well, .-the . Electro-Chemlc
treatment has cured me after I Dad suf-
fered untold misery for seven yeirs and
aftÂ«r two of the best family phyiidans
in San Francisco had told ma thit tha
only, thing tnat would save .my life
would be a surgical operation. X am
happy and grateful to the Eleetro-
Chemlc specialists for my cure, and X
want every suffering woman to know ot
this wonderful - new treatment â so pain-
less â so pleasant â so quick in its effect*
-and so cheap. My case was on a of thosÂ«
distressing ovarian troubles. Tumors had
! all formed and the pains in the lower ab-
domen were awful. The pains and weak-
ness in my back at times were almost
unbearable. I was dizzy, I could not
eat, I was sick at my stomach and at
times could not sleep. My picture at tha
top of this article is quite good.- My
name is Mrs. E. W. Suttle and I live at
No. 132 Perry "street. Ban Francifco. Any
one Interested in my wonderful' cur* la
.at liberty to call on mo for further par-
ticulars. . , â¢
If -Electro-Chemistry had accomplished
nothing else but tha cure of; suffering
women, keeping them off of the operating
table. It would take a first- place amongst
the greatest of modern discoveries as a
curative agent, but Electro-Chemistry Is
the moat aueceaaful treatment now In
use for .the cure of Consumption. Ca-
tarrh. Asthma, Bronchitis. Rheumatism.

The Electro-Chemlc examination is tin
most reliable examination that any suf-
ferer can have. Such an examination
will quickly ahow whether a caaÂ« la cura-
ble or not. and this examination la now
absolutely free to.any sufferer applying
at tha Institute for It. The Electro-
Chemle Institute occupies nearly the
whole first floor of the large building at
US Grant avenue, corner of Post street.
The- office hours are from nine to five
and from seven to eight, daily, and from
ten to one on Sundays. There are re-
tired and private apartments set aside
for the male and female patients. The
Klectro-Chemic Institute is the only In-
stitution on the Pacific Coast doing thla
work. The office is centrally located at
118 Grant avenue, and persons desiring
to consult the Electro-Chemlc specialists
will do well to make no mistake regard-
ing the place.
The Klectro-Chemle bom* treatment Is
very successful and patienta who are
aick and who live at a distance should
try to come for personal examination
when possible, when this can not Be
done," a "abort -description - of principal
symptoms, should be sent in and full In-
structions regarding > examination and a
home course of the treatment will be
promptly forwarded, free of charge.

At the Park Hospital the girl said
she had : beer) badly* treated at home.
From a : statement made by her \ people
it would seem that her wrongs, were
fancied. fn^te?
Edith Austin's people say that they
know of no reason why she: shoulG
have attempted suicide. They know of
no love affair. She lives at 1166. Ellis
street. Miss 'Austin's beauty caused an
Eastern magazine : . to use her picture
as a poster- in a recent issue.
Tired of life at . an age when all
should have looked bright to her. beau
tiful Edith Austin tried unsuccessfully
to end her life yesterday in Golden
Gate Park by taking-, carbolic acid.
There is no apparent reason why the
young' woman should seek death. She
Is more than ordinarily pretty and has
hosts of admirers.
But brooding over., little fancied
grievances turned her mind to morbid
thought. Yesterday morning she
kissed her invalid mother good-by, and
stole out into the park. , She sought a
secluded spot in the shadow of some
oaks and meditated in a girlish way on
the futility of existence.
She had with her a bottle of carbolic
acid. Just to swallow that would end
all pain and sorrow, real or fancied,
she thought.- It was verv easy to die
and very wearisome to live.
The girl looked at' the vial; then sud
denly raised it to her lips! â With a
shriek of pain she dropped: the: bottle
and writhed in agony on the "grass.
The fiery stuff burned her pretty face
and blistered her red lips. This real
pain was worse than all her fancied In
juries. She did not want to die. v
The girl's agonized cries attracted a
policeman, who summoned an ambu
lance. She was taken 1 to the Park
Emergency Hospital, where she was
treated by Dr. Hill. The young, woman
was in no danger, as she had not swal
lowed any of the acid: Death was
harder than she thought.

I must add that I was struck with the cour
age of the hard-fighting Russian soldiers. I
I viewed a number of engagements at close range
and I must say that the Russians showed a
great deal of tenacity, especially in hol0ing
their position*. With my departure from the
Orient the United States waÂ» left without a

BETWEEN* TWO FIRKS.
Lieutenant Fortescue distinguished
himself with. Lieutenant Count Wollf
j skeil, military attache of the German
army, during qne of the heavy engage-
I ments before Port Arthur by getting
between the two armies and taking\a
number of photographs of the troops
in the midst of battle. He also pre
pared a map of the engagement. . in
which he was assisted by Captain Sir
Alexander Bannerman of the British
Royal Engineers. Just before his de
parture from the front the Japanese
officials requepted him to give no
publicity to the photographs, explain
ing that it was Japan's intentions not
to give out for publication any of the
more Important details of the engage
ments around Port Arthur until a
later date. â¢ Â¦ . .
\ The Japanese Government has not
yet issued these statements and in con
sequence Lieutenant Fortescue is bound
by pledge to keep his photographs
from the public gaze. The work of
taking these pictures and the prelim
inary preparation of his map con
sumed the greater part of twenty-four
hours, during which he/and trfe Ger
man attache were constantly in dan
p:er from the missiles flying between
the two armies.

Asked when he thought Port Ar
thur would probably fall, the lieuten
ant smiled significantly as hereplied*
'Well. General Stoessel will have
something to say about that."
"Apparently." suggested the inter
viewer, "your presence with the Jap
anese army did not warp your judg
ment of the- Russians."- Fortescue re
plied:
No. it did not. Both armies are fi fi htln*
gallantly and most fairly. Americans should
not place too much credence In the reports
they have received concerning brutalities prac
ticed by the Russians or the Japanese for
they are not true. Dumdum bullets are not
being; used, nor have the Russians enhanced
the . strength of their defenses , with barbed
wire The wire they are using is the plain '
.material. The beet of care Is being taken of
the wounded on both sides.-
BATTLE AT CLOSE RANGE.
I have read stories printed in AmerlcaYi pa
pers of how. the wounded or. the Japanese and
the Russians had been cruelly , put to death
when Cound on . the . battlefields. 'â¢ but an Inves
tigation of these resorts will show that in a
great majority qf cases tho wouimed fell with
many bullets tÂ«U their bodiesâ a fact . which
was . misconstrued ; as an ! Indication that their
opponents flred into their bodies when the en
gagements were iover. The truth is that the
fighting has been at ouch close range that fre
quently men fall wounded by a dozen bullets,
and In Â¦ one Instance Â¦ of which I was a wit
ness a Japanese of fleer fell Â¦ pierced by twenty
four ehotÂ». He had unfortunately got in front

YOITNG ARMY OFFICER WHO WAS
WITH XOGPS ARMY BEFORE
PORT ARTHUR.
Amccg the arrivals yesterday from
the Orient on the steamship Doric was
Lieutenant GranvillÂ«Â» R. Fortescue of
the Traith United States Cavalry. He
is a nephew of President Roosevelt
2nd if? returninr from the Far East,
vhither he was pent as a special rep
resentative of the army to make a re
port on the progress of the Russian-
Japarfese war. For thiF missicyi ho
was siven the. courtesy rank of cap
tain.
Fortescue is a young officer who
Ferve.id in the Philippines and Cuba
and is returning to Washington with
valuable information concerning the
operations of the Japanese in the field.
This, however, he has pledged himself
to keep a secret, so far as the public
i? concerned, until the war is over.
H<? arrived in Tokio March 5 and
shortly afterward joined the regular
military attaches as guests of the Jap
anese officials in a sea tour around the
l -\tr:ous scenes of later battles. Finally
5iÂ° was assigned to the Third Japanese
A-n-y, commanded by General Xogi.
V 1th that army Lieutenant Fortescue
witnessed a number of fierce battles
before Port Arthur, but. as already
said, he has promised to make no
public utterances concerning the mili
tary operations. Discussing his exper
ioncep with the Third army the lieu
tenant said:

, The new Alcazar Company last
night gave a delightful presentation of
Esmond's clever .comedy, "The Wil
derness." The production was a fin
ished one in every detail and the ad
mirable acting of the principals
stamped it with the distinctive mark
of success. The burden of the piece
was borne,. by John Craig- and Miss
Lillian Lawrence and to say that they
were equal to, the requirements of two
very difficult roles would be putting it
mildJy. Miss Laurence as Mabel
Vaughan certainly proved her.- claim
to. the possession of dramatic talents
of a high order. and throughout the en
tire performance, demonstrated that
she is a tactful as well as a' capable
actress. Mr. Craig was refreshingly
pleasing in the part of Sir Harry Al
beit, rather heavy in portions of his
scenes. He is manly in his impersona
tion, however, and his undue fervor in
spots can easily be excused when his
uniformly good.work is taken into con
sideration. Luke Conness acted Jack
Kennerley splendidly and shows posi
tive improvement on longer acquaint
ance. The other parts were all well
sustained. by George Osbourne, Harry
Hilliard, John B.Maher, Walter Be-
Iasco, Pauline Maitland,,Ruth Allen,
Adele Belffarde and Elizabeth Wood

Sorensen, who, played the children in
a natural manner that was the chief
charm of their Individual efforts.

. There was a large attendance at the
musical and literary entertainment
given last night for the benefit of St.
Francis parochial residence fund in
Native- Sons' Hall. The programme
contained many excellent numbers, in
cluding overture, vocal and instru
mental solos, "farces; and high ; class
humor by clever comedians. . ' " â¢ 'Â¦* .
.Ted E. Box from the Orpheum en
tertained .with his 'eccentricities and
whistled and talked himself ' into the
good'* graces of the audience.
Miss Belle Williams, also from the Or
pheum, -won admiration for her easy,
merry method of interpreting comic
songs. A number of young ladies-
Misses Katherine Rankin, Grace
Gould, .Leonora Roland, Pauline Lord
and Emma Dudenâ made mirth in a
farce called "The Burglar."
'Miss Eleanor Mangan sang sweetly
and 'â¢ Grennan and Minner did a
"stunt." William Altrhann did a clev
er whistling act. Frank de Coss, Syl
vester McDonald, Misses Josephine
Clare. Katherine Dougherty and An
nie Bellew did very good comedy in
a farce entitled "The Obstinate Fam

solo was one â¢ of the brilliant features
of the evening.

As to the performance "itself there
was no' if. weak or defective stick of
timber in the whole cast. The role
of PhyJiis afforded , Amelia Gardner
an opportunity of exhibiting some de
lightful comedy acting, and she be
came a favorite from the start. How-'

sion by his splendid characterization
of Richard Carewe, the scene between
himself and the repentant Imp

mainder of the quartet of guardian

dles, Frank MacVicars as the col
onel and John D. O'Hara as the
doctor were all that Â¦ could be de
sired. Mr. Mestayer added fresh lau
rels to his fame by his personation of
the Imp. In the small part of Da
vid Hirsch Joseph Callahan had an
excel'ent makeup and wisely refrained
from overdoing the part. In the lit
tle that she has to do as "the. firefly"
Kleanor Gordon was fascinating and
effective. , Â¦ '
: That the public appreciates a good

"When We Were Twenty-One." With
theneXv additions to the company the
audience was forced to admit that the

The excellent- and well-harmonized
acting was supplemented by the equal

In the scene where Dante in Rome
receives word of his banishment from
Florence Mr. Bacigalupi perhaps
showed to best advantage. His profile,
lean, ascetic, is at a distance no bad
physical reminder of Dante's, and one
was grateful again for the player's
clear enunciation and intelligent ' de
livery. The Virgil also was ' particu
larly well portrayed by Fred Churchill,
and William A. Breen as Corso Donati
and John Mulrenin as Glno di Pistoia
both deserve mention. There was a
Beatrice, a boy Beatrice â again quaint
ly reminiscent of the miracle play. It
was done as well a? could be expected
by Francis Buckley. Ghibellines and
Guelphs galore filled in, and to this
all came a large and cheerful audience.
Twice again, on Wednesday and Fri
day evenlnps. the play. will be given. â¢
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
As a whole the piece impresses much
as a miracle play, naive and quaint:
One feels this particlarly in the visions
of the inferno, where red demons spit
an unfortunate gentleman on redhot
forks. But it is only amusing here, not
ridiculous. So much can hardly be said
of the pandemonic finale, that is.how
ever, melodramatically effective. But
it is as a simple and sympathetic little
portrait of the poet that, the pla*y best
pleases. Dante, in the hands of James
Bacigalupi, is a remarkably intelligent
portrayal. Mr. Bacigalupi jivill be re
membered as the very clever: Judas of
the Santa Clara Passion Play and he
last night again demonstrated unusual
dramatic ability. It was throughout a
dignified and thoughtful conception.
Here it is that Father O'Conor makes
his protest. A "drama" in three acts
that he also calls . "Dante." In more
ways than one the O'Conor drama'dif
fers f rorri 1 the Sardou play. Properly
speaking it is not a drama, but a se
ries of scenes from the life of the ooet.
It sympathetically presents him as
poet, politician, patriot, lover and ex
ile, and historic accuracy has been
strictly observed. In the Dante role
the poet's own words are f reauently
used, and the rest of the. dialogue is
well in keeping. With one exception.
The farcical little scene of the street
boys, with its "Yep," "Naw!" "kind o'
scared," "kind o' creepy," is curiously
out of . harmony with the simple dis:
nity of the rest. Nine scenes in all there
are. Set in Rome, Florence, hell and
Ravenna, they afford plenty of oppor
tunity to the scenic powers. And most
creditably they, were staged, the set
ting of the gate- of hell being really
impressive. -._'â¢Â¦Â¦
"Dante," a drama written In, protest
against the Sardou ' "Dante" by the
Rev. J. F.-X. O'Conor, S. J., was pre
sented | last night , at St. Ignatius Hall,
by members of the Gentlemen's Sodal-'
ity. ' ,, ' Â¦;
The protest reaches us here before
the exciting crime. , Echoes , of the
Sardou "Dante," presented last season
by Sir Henry Irving, * have indeed
reached us. Tne play, despite the dis
tinction of both playwright and player,
secerns to have spelt most kinds of dra
matic failure. Its sins against good
taste and truth are alleged as offenses
in chief. Dante is dowered with left
handed offspring that plays Important
part, and with a paramour, Pla del
Tolemei, also much in evidence. .There
is a general back stairs attitude in the
viewpoint, and the attempt to reconcile
the Dante of the "Vita Nuova" and the
Dante of the back stairs, is said to
have met with high confusion.

At the Park Hospital the girl said
she had : beer) badly* treated at home.
From a : statement made by her \ people
it would seem that her wrongs, were
fancied. fn^te?
Edith Austin's people say that they
know of no reason why she: shoulG
have attempted suicide. They know of
no love affair. She lives at 1166. Ellis
street. Miss 'Austin's beauty caused an
Eastern magazine : . to use her picture
as a poster- in a recent issue.
Tired of life at . an age when all
should have looked bright to her. beau
tiful Edith Austin tried unsuccessfully
to end her life yesterday in Golden
Gate Park by taking-, carbolic acid.
There is no apparent reason why the
young' woman should seek death. She
Is more than ordinarily pretty and has
hosts of admirers.
But brooding over., little fancied
grievances turned her mind to morbid
thought. Yesterday morning she
kissed her invalid mother good-by, and
stole out into the park. , She sought a
secluded spot in the shadow of some
oaks and meditated in a girlish way on
the futility of existence.
She had with her a bottle of carbolic
acid. Just to swallow that would end
all pain and sorrow, real or fancied,
she thought.- It was verv easy to die
and very wearisome to live.
The girl looked at' the vial; then sud
denly raised it to her lips! â With a
shriek of pain she dropped: the: bottle
and writhed in agony on the "grass.
The fiery stuff burned her pretty face
and blistered her red lips. This real
pain was worse than all her fancied In
juries. She did not want to die. v
The girl's agonized cries attracted a
policeman, who summoned an ambu
lance. She was taken 1 to the Park
Emergency Hospital, where she was
treated by Dr. Hill. The young, woman
was in no danger, as she had not swal
lowed any of the acid: Death was
harder than she thought.

miration for the bravery of the Japanese, and
I must add that I was struck with the cour
age of the hard-fighting Russian soldiers. I
I viewed a number of engagements at close range
and I must say that the Russians showed a
great deal of tenacity, especially in hol0ing
their position*. With my departure from the
Orient the United States waÂ» left without a
repr<Â«eniative with the Japanese army, al
though we are still represented in the opposing
army.

BETWEEN* TWO FIRKS.
Lieutenant Fortescue distinguished
himself with. Lieutenant Count Wollf
j skeil, military attache of the German
army, during qne of the heavy engage-
I ments before Port Arthur by getting
between the two armies and taking\a
number of photographs of the troops
in the midst of battle. He also pre
pared a map of the engagement. . in
which he was assisted by Captain Sir
Alexander Bannerman of the British
Royal Engineers. Just before his de
parture from the front the Japanese
officials requepted him to give no
publicity to the photographs, explain
ing that it was Japan's intentions not
to give out for publication any of the
more Important details of the engage
ments around Port Arthur until a
later date. â¢ Â¦ . .
\ The Japanese Government has not
yet issued these statements and in con
sequence Lieutenant Fortescue is bound
by pledge to keep his photographs
from the public gaze. The work of
taking these pictures and the prelim
inary preparation of his map con
sumed the greater part of twenty-four
hours, during which he/and trfe Ger
man attache were constantly in dan
p:er from the missiles flying between
the two armies.
' ' .-.:Â¦ -Â¦Â¦Â¦>., Â¦ ' - 'Â¦-
Asked when he thought Port Ar
thur would probably fall, the lieuten
ant smiled significantly as hereplied*
'Well. General Stoessel will have
something to say about that."
"Apparently." suggested the inter
viewer, "your presence with the Jap
anese army did not warp your judg
ment of the- Russians."- Fortescue re
plied:
No. it did not. Both armies are fi fi htln*
gallantly and most fairly. Americans should
not place too much credence In the reports
they have received concerning brutalities prac
ticed by the Russians or the Japanese for
they are not true. Dumdum bullets are not
being; used, nor have the Russians enhanced
the . strength of their defenses , with barbed
wire The wire they are using is the plain '
.material. The beet of care Is being taken of
the wounded on both sides.-
BATTLE AT CLOSE RANGE.
I have read stories printed in AmerlcaYi pa
pers of how. the wounded or. the Japanese and
the Russians had been cruelly , put to death
when Cound on . the . battlefields. 'â¢ but an Inves
tigation of these resorts will show that in a
great majority qf cases tho wouimed fell with
many bullets tÂ«U their bodiesâ a fact . which
was . misconstrued ; as an ! Indication that their
opponents flred into their bodies when the en
gagements were iover. The truth is that the
fighting has been at ouch close range that fre
quently men fall wounded by a dozen bullets,
and In Â¦ one Instance Â¦ of which I was a wit
ness a Japanese of fleer fell Â¦ pierced by twenty
four ehotÂ». He had unfortunately got in front
of a Gatllnsjnin. ...
-While Lieutenant â¢ Fortescue .' de
clined to" telljust how; close he had
got to.' the stronger." fortifications o f
Port Arthur .with*, the â¢ Jaoanese^army
he did gay that when; he left the. army
on September 29 the latter's big guns
were dropping ' shells ; on the .Russian

Ferve.id in the Philippines and Cuba
and is returning to Washington with
valuable information concerning the
operations of the Japanese in the field.
This, however, he has pledged himself
to keep a secret, so far as the public
i? concerned, until the war is over.
H<? arrived in Tokio March 5 and
shortly afterward joined the regular
military attaches as guests of the Jap
anese officials in a sea tour around the
l -\tr:ous scenes of later battles. Finally
5iÂ° was assigned to the Third Japanese
A-n-y, commanded by General Xogi.
V 1th that army Lieutenant Fortescue
witnessed a number of fierce battles
before Port Arthur, but. as already
said, he has promised to make no
public utterances concerning the mili
tary operations. Discussing his exper
ioncep with the Third army the lieu
tenant said:

, The new Alcazar Company last
night gave a delightful presentation of
Esmond's clever .comedy, "The Wil
derness." The production was a fin
ished one in every detail and the ad
mirable acting of the principals
stamped it with the distinctive mark
of success. The burden of the piece
was borne,. by John Craig- and Miss
Lillian Lawrence and to say that they
were equal to, the requirements of two
very difficult roles would be putting it
mildJy. Miss Laurence as Mabel
Vaughan certainly proved her.- claim
to. the possession of dramatic talents
of a high order. and throughout the en
tire performance, demonstrated that
she is a tactful as well as a' capable
actress. Mr. Craig was refreshingly
pleasing in the part of Sir Harry Al
beit, rather heavy in portions of his
scenes. He is manly in his impersona
tion, however, and his undue fervor in
spots can easily be excused when his
uniformly good.work is taken into con
sideration. Luke Conness acted Jack
Kennerley splendidly and shows posi
tive improvement on longer acquaint
ance. The other parts were all well
sustained. by George Osbourne, Harry
Hilliard, John B.Maher, Walter Be-
Iasco, Pauline Maitland,,Ruth Allen,
Adele Belffarde and Elizabeth Wood
son, not forgetting Gladys and Sybil
Sorensen, who, played the children in
a natural manner that was the chief
charm of their Individual efforts.

. There was a large attendance at the
musical and literary entertainment
given last night for the benefit of St.
Francis parochial residence fund in
Native- Sons' Hall. The programme
contained many excellent numbers, in
cluding overture, vocal and instru
mental solos, "farces; and high ; class
humor by clever comedians. . ' " â¢ 'Â¦* .
.Ted E. Box from the Orpheum en
tertained .with his 'eccentricities and
whistled and talked himself ' into the
good'* graces of the audience.
Miss Belle Williams, also from the Or
pheum, -won admiration for her easy,
merry method of interpreting comic
songs. A number of young ladies-
Misses Katherine Rankin, Grace
Gould, .Leonora Roland, Pauline Lord
and Emma Dudenâ made mirth in a
farce called "The Burglar."
'Miss Eleanor Mangan sang sweetly
and 'â¢ Grennan and Minner did a
"stunt." William Altrhann did a clev
er whistling act. Frank de Coss, Syl
vester McDonald, Misses Josephine
Clare. Katherine Dougherty and An
nie Bellew did very good comedy in
a farce entitled "The Obstinate Fam
ily." Miss Ethyl Grazer's French horn
solo was one â¢ of the brilliant features
of the evening.

As to the performance "itself there
was no' if. weak or defective stick of
timber in the whole cast. The role
of PhyJiis afforded , Amelia Gardner
an opportunity of exhibiting some de
lightful comedy acting, and she be
came a favorite from the start. How-'
ard Gould made a pronounced impres
sion by his splendid characterization
of Richard Carewe, the scene between
himself and the repentant Imp
(Harry Mestayer) In the last act be

mainder of the quartet of guardian
angels! George Woodward, as: Wad
dles, Frank MacVicars as the col
onel and John D. O'Hara as the
doctor were all that Â¦ could be de
sired. Mr. Mestayer added fresh lau
rels to his fame by his personation of
the Imp. In the small part of Da
vid Hirsch Joseph Callahan had an
excel'ent makeup and wisely refrained
from overdoing the part. In the lit
tle that she has to do as "the. firefly"
Kleanor Gordon was fascinating and
effective. , Â¦ '
: That the public appreciates a good
play by a first-class f company and put
upon the stage in j ftrst-class style was
evidenced last night by the overflow
ing attendance at the Majestic The
ater to witness an incomparable per
formance of Henry V. ; Esmond's
"When We Were Twenty-One." With
theneXv additions to the company the
audience was forced to admit that the
boast of the management that it had
th,e greatest stock company in Ameri
ca was s perilously dose to the "truth.
The excellent- and well-harmonized
acting was supplemented by the equal
skill with which the play. was mount
ed, notably the second act representing
the assembly room, of the Athenian
Club in London.

."Paul. Kauvar," a venerable drama

who has for a long-time;pleased,thea

turn to the Central after j a week's ill
ness by appearing' in the title role; and
was the hit of the performance.; He -was
ably assisted by Ethel Clifton as Diane,
who gave a good portrayal of the emo

Â¦ Henry "Shumer- as Gouroc was suf
ficiently detestable and heavy and .won

James Corrigan was! droll as Arlstides
and together with Edna Ellsmere, who
was almost too pretty for the part, fur
nished the comedy, r Julia ,JBlanc .as
Scarlotle had a -thankless part as a
woman -of the people. V , .
The staging of the play is very good.
The tableaux of the guillotine, the bom
bardment and burning of the city and
the sacking: of the royalist palace, were
excellent in effect.
-Next week, "The Worst Woman in
London."
In the scene where Dante in Rome
receives word of his banishment from
Florence Mr. Bacigalupi perhaps
showed to best advantage. His profile,
lean, ascetic, is at a distance no bad
physical reminder of Dante's, and one
was grateful again for the player's
clear enunciation and intelligent ' de
livery. The Virgil also was ' particu
larly well portrayed by Fred Churchill,
and William A. Breen as Corso Donati
and John Mulrenin as Glno di Pistoia
both deserve mention. There was a
Beatrice, a boy Beatrice â again quaint
ly reminiscent of the miracle play. It
was done as well a? could be expected
by Francis Buckley. Ghibellines and
Guelphs galore filled in, and to this
all came a large and cheerful audience.
Twice again, on Wednesday and Fri
day evenlnps. the play. will be given. â¢
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
As a whole the piece impresses much
as a miracle play, naive and quaint:
One feels this particlarly in the visions
of the inferno, where red demons spit
an unfortunate gentleman on redhot
forks. But it is only amusing here, not
ridiculous. So much can hardly be said
of the pandemonic finale, that is.how
ever, melodramatically effective. But
it is as a simple and sympathetic little
portrait of the poet that, the pla*y best
pleases. Dante, in the hands of James
Bacigalupi, is a remarkably intelligent
portrayal. Mr. Bacigalupi jivill be re
membered as the very clever: Judas of
the Santa Clara Passion Play and he
last night again demonstrated unusual
dramatic ability. It was throughout a
dignified and thoughtful conception.
Here it is that Father O'Conor makes
his protest. A "drama" in three acts
that he also calls . "Dante." In more
ways than one the O'Conor drama'dif
fers f rorri 1 the Sardou play. Properly
speaking it is not a drama, but a se
ries of scenes from the life of the ooet.
It sympathetically presents him as
poet, politician, patriot, lover and ex
ile, and historic accuracy has been
strictly observed. In the Dante role
the poet's own words are f reauently
used, and the rest of the. dialogue is
well in keeping. With one exception.
The farcical little scene of the street
boys, with its "Yep," "Naw!" "kind o'
scared," "kind o' creepy," is curiously
out of . harmony with the simple dis:
nity of the rest. Nine scenes in all there
are. Set in Rome, Florence, hell and
Ravenna, they afford plenty of oppor
tunity to the scenic powers. And most
creditably they, were staged, the set
ting of the gate- of hell being really
impressive. -._'â¢Â¦Â¦
"Dante," a drama written In, protest
against the Sardou ' "Dante" by the
Rev. J. F.-X. O'Conor, S. J., was pre
sented | last night , at St. Ignatius Hall,
by members of the Gentlemen's Sodal-'
ity. ' ,, ' Â¦;
The protest reaches us here before
the exciting crime. , Echoes , of the
Sardou "Dante," presented last season
by Sir Henry Irving, * have indeed
reached us. Tne play, despite the dis
tinction of both playwright and player,
secerns to have spelt most kinds of dra
matic failure. Its sins against good
taste and truth are alleged as offenses
in chief. Dante is dowered with left
handed offspring that plays Important
part, and with a paramour, Pla del
Tolemei, also much in evidence. .There
is a general back stairs attitude in the
viewpoint, and the attempt to reconcile
the Dante of the "Vita Nuova" and the
Dante of the back stairs, is said to
have met with high confusion.

"The Wars of the Consulate," the
second In' the series of lectures on
the Napoleonic period : by Professor
H. Morse Stephens of the University
of California, was given last night In
the art gallery of Mechanics' Pavilion.
The hall was well filled and Profes
sor Stephens' discourse was thorough
ly enjoyed. â¢ -Â» Â¦
The speaker prefaced his remarks
on the "Wars of the Consulate" by an
original pen picture- of Napoleon. He
distinguished the real difference 'be
tween "the thin, meager, spare Napo
leon" of the Consulate period and the
corpulent Napoleon of the . later pe
riod, , which is the popular conception
of the great war hero. .
;:He also Impressed the fact that the
general conception of Napoleon's re
turn from Egypt was that the com
ing of .the little corporal saved
France. This view Professor Stephens
contradicted by showing that the vic
torious Russian army had been ef
fectually destroyed in the Alos
through the efforts of General Mas
sena-and that the political situation
was further pacified by the slgnintr of
the memorable "convention â¢ of Alt
mannâthe crowning victory.'of Brune.

Hutchinson disappeared . from the
Hotel Sequoia a week ago Saturday.
The ifollowing day he visited a stable
man'in Ross- Valley, to whom. he paid
a small bill Incurred a", few weeks be
fore. : That, was the last seen of him
until his body was found yesterday.
Mrs, I. J. Truman, wife of the well
known, attorney and . sister of Hutch
inson, several days ago appealed to the
authorities of Marin . County to make
a search for tf er missing relative. .They
did so.withou't result. Yesterday morn
ing *' the r Chief of Police of San Rafael
received an anonymous letter saying
that a body^ of a man was lying, in
the , dam , in Williams Gulch. ; Con
stables Agnews and Hughes immedi
ately, proceeded to the point designat
ed^and found Hutchlnson's remins. It
Is believed that the body was discovered
by a party of picnickers, who refrained
from signing the note addressed to the
Chief of Police of San Rafael for the
purpose of avoiding notoriety.
Hutchinson recently lost : his wife
and had since been grieving over, her
death. For several days before he dis
appeared he had failed to partake of
food.. It is thought . that .after wan
dering about Marln County for several
days without food he became exhaust
ed and finally fell unconscious/ into
the dam. , Hutchinson formerly was
proprietor of the . Mountain | View Ho
tel ', in Ross Valley, and Is well-known
on both sides ; of .the^bay.
The mystery surrounding the ' disap
pearance ten days ago of W. J.'Hutch
inson, clerk of the Hotel Sequoia, was
cleared; up yesterday when* his body
was found floating in a dam in Bit;
Williams - Gulch, two \ miles from Ross
Valley.. Although Hutchinson had been
despondent for some time it Is not be
lieved' by J his relktly es that his 'death
was a suicide.- They are Inclined* to.be
lieve '; that after ivfandering ;'aboiit "the
country for several days he became ex
hausted and fell into the dam. A strong
point' against the suicide theory is ' the
fact that; the dam contains very, little
water, I' and' certainly not enough to
drown a man who was able to assist
himself.. \V_4-.' ... ..". .
The board refused to call a special
election for freeholders to frame .a
new city charter.
Three of the five City Trustees were
present â President Forderer, W. M.
Beyers and C. J. Hammond. After
bearing Charles S. Neal, George H.
Mastlck and Sam S. Green argue for
a new charter and Herman Toelken
and M. A. Clark speak against it
President Forderer announced that no
provision had been made for the ex
pense of a freeholders' and a charter
election and that the treasury of the
'city would not permit such an outlay
to be incurred.
"We have no money to spare for any
such project," said President Forderer,
"and I believe it would not be advis
able for us to increase the deficit . we
are at present carrying. While I am
In favor of a new charter, I do not
think that the time Is yet ripe for us
to draw up and adopt one."
ALAMEDA, Oct, 24.â Dr. H- M. Pond
resigned to-night as a member of the
Board of City Trustees. In his letter
of resignation he said he retired be
cause, he believed the city's affairs as
well as his own interests would be bet
ter conserved if his place were taken
-by one whose business gave him more
time to d^evote to municipal business.
Dr. Pond said he retired with heartfelt
â¢"VUnss of good will toward all his for
/er associates. He specially mentioned
mistee W.- M. Bowers, with whom he
jiad served on committees. The resig
nation was accepted.
Howard said the company should re
ceive a fair profit on the cost of distri
bution, which he estimated at one dollar
a mile. He proposed an amendment to
a franchise for a line out Broadway,
from Piedmont avenue to the Country
Club's -grounds to compel the company
to agree to do this work, but the
amendment was defeated, a majority of
the Council desiring that It be taken
up when a more important franchise
Ehould come before them. Howard
said he expected to have a conference
with the railroad officials this week
touching further details of the plan,
which he declared had been adopted in
many Eastern cities. The Councilman
said the cost of fresh water used last
year in street sprinkling was $33,000.
The Bay Cities Water Company to
day submitted to the special committee
on municipal water supply a 1 detailed
statement In connection with its offer
to furnish the city with a supply of 20 -
000,000 gallons of water a day at a cost
of $3,750,000. The company added to
this a suggestion that It might include
the construction of a distributing sys
tem for $1,600,000 additional, based on
City Engineer F. C. Turner's estimate,
making a total of $5,250,000 for a com
plete system. Â« The City Council wtll
meet the company's officials Wednes
day afternoon to discuss the proposal.
Councilman John L. Howard to
night gave the City. Council an outline
of a street sprinkling project he will
soon present in detail. He wants to
use the Oakland Traction Consolidat
ed Street Railway system In connec
tion with the salt water plant the city
is preparing to install. . ,
Howard's plan calls for large" 'tank'
cars to be" supplied with hood sprink
lers that will throw the salt water on
each side of the. street, leaving the
space covered by the tracks to be
sprinkled -with oil or fresh water, as
the company might select. Supply hy-'
drants are first to be established at in
tervals along the line of a large main
from Lake Merritt, along Twentieth
street to Market. Other sections of the
city will be included as soon as money
Is available.

Consternation spread In th* ranks of
Berkeley's football enthusiasts to-day
when It " becamA known that Ben
Stroud, the center and captain of the
blue and gold eleven, had been retired
to the > hospital with a severe abscess
tn the right ear and that an operation
was deemed Imperative. Though Coach
Hopper is non-committal on the subject
the fear Is expressed. by members of
the football team that Stroud's disabil
ity may become so serious as to keep
him, out of thÂ© big gameA :
The big center's disability comes as
the culmination of several * weeks*
trouble. A severe cold in the head,
contracted early in the . season, re
cently . developed Into an j abscess In
the ear. Though Stroud's malady was
thought serious by the coaches no ces
sation from, practice was allowed him
and it was trusted that the. dally
ministrations of a physician would re
duce the affection. Since this has
proved unavailing the blue and gold
hopes have taken a decided slump.
The loss of Captain Stroud "would
have a disastrous effect on Berkeley's
eleven.:. One of the .heaviest "men on
the team and a sure pin upon which
th.e whole" rush line hangs, Stroud Isa
player â¢ who could "â¢ not be well spared
from the team. His moral strength as
captain of . the eleven Is equally val
uable to the players* spirit. -'

Kramm died fifteen years. ago. Some
time afterward Mrs. Kramm became
Mrs. Anthony Simons, but .she pro
cured a divorce from Simons and was
free to listen to the old bookkeeper's
protestations of love. Mrs. Peterson
has one son, Joseph Kramm, who has
continued to handle the Anchor
brewery's affairs. Another son,
Charles H. Kramm, died while he was
serving as a City Coucilman.
Mrs. Augusta Kra'mm; widow of
Charles Kramra, a pioneer brewer' of
Oakland and one of < the best known
members ! of the German colony of
Oakland, has surprised her friends by
becoming the bride of Fred Peterson,
a saloon man at Seventh and Frank
lin streets. The wedding occurred
Thursday last at Martinez. Mr. and
Mrs. Peterson have taken up residence
at the old Kramm home, 814 Tele
graph avenue.
Peterson years ago was bookkeeper
at the old Anchor brewery, which his
wife's first husband conducted for
many years. He engaged in the res
taurant business more than thirty
years ago, having been one of the first
men to embark in that business in
Oakland. Peterson stepped out of
the brewery after it was sold to an
English syndicate. It .was during his
employment there that he became ac
quainted with Mrs. Kramm, whom**he
has won as his bride.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. v 2 4.
OAKLAND, Oct. 24.â Within a block
Of the Southern Pacific Company's sta
tion at First street and Broadway,
with brilliantly lighted electric cars
passing every few minutes, a masked
robber held up Arena & Brigonl's
eaioon, 661 Broadway, at 8:30 o'clock,
stood off the two proprietors with a
pistol and leisurely rifled the cash
register of (25. The cool Intruder drag
ged Arena to the front door with him
and leaving the startled saloon man
with a â¢warning not to move, ran
swiftly down Broadway Into Second
street and along Second to Washing
ton, disappearing in the darkness
among the lumber piles at the Puget
Bound Lumber Company's yard on
First street.
As soon as the thief left the saloon
Arena ran back to the till, got a pistol
and sent a bullet after the fleeing rob
ber. The police think the masked man
took the 9 o'clock train at First street
for San Francisco. They did not re
ceive a report of the robbery until some
time afterward.
Arena and his partner were alone
In the saloon when the robber entered
by the front door. Brigoni was sitting
tn a chair and Arena, leaning over a
barrel, was talking to him. The visitor,
with his revolver pointed at the pair,
commanded them, "Throw up your
hands." " The saloon men thought it
was a joke and didn't respond until
the second order came, with an em
phasis that Induced quick action. â¢
Closely covering the men with his
weapon the robber walked to the coin
receptacle and opened the drawer. With
one hand he took the money out. and
after he had emptied the register,
walked over to Arena and grabbed him
by the coat. The thief backed away
toward the entrance, all the while
watching Brigonl and directing both
of the men to keep quiet. He peered
out of the door for an instant, then
let go of Arena and made a run down
Broadway. â¢
While the occurrence was in full
swing an electric car stood on the,
Broadway tracks, barely fifty feet dis
tant. The first notice the saloon-,
keepers gave was when Arena fired his^
pistol and set up a yelling. A flagman'
at the Southern Pacific crossing at First
street heard the cries and the shot,
but paid no attention to them, think
ing it was a Baloon brawl. The robber
was seen as he ran through Second
street and Washington, but his trail
Â¦was lost in the lumber yards by the
time the police were called. Arena de
scribed the man as heavy set, medium
height, wearing dark clothes and a
black slouch hat. The mask of black
cloth covered his face to his eyes.

The audience was a large one and

Mountain View : and orchardists from
the surrounding country. Vocal music
was rendered by the Stanford quartet.
W. T. Wright presided as chairman.
Hayes' address reviewed the history
of the Republican party and the tar
iff laws. He urged the voters to work
for the election of the entire Repub
lican ticket, so that President Rooso
velt would have Republican Congress
men to support him in his policy.
Hayes assured the fruit growers that
If he were sent to Congress- their in
terests would not suffer by a tinker

McKinlay made a splendid impres
sion. He was followed by T. B. Dozler,
who for , an hour addressed the peopie
In one of the most brilliant speeches
ever heard in Uklah. He pointed out
the interest of this section-in the pol
icy of protection, and urged the vot
ers to stand by the party which not
only gives protection to their prod
ucts, but seeks to extend similar bene
fits to every section of the country. He
asked them to vote in a way that
would give other industrles^the bene
fits-of the tariff in the same dejrree
that is obtained here. â¢ Dozier paid a
high tribute to the worth of the Con
gressional nominee.
McKinlay came to Ukiah on a spe
cial train, accompanied by the Wil
lits Band and more than 100 excur
sionists. The meeting was held at
Marks' Hall, which contained an au
dience of more- than 1000 persons. Mc-
Kinlay spoke three-quarters , of an
hour on national Issues, paying high
tribute to the merit and worth of
President Roosevelt, whose re-election
he urged as the first duty of the na
tion. The voters were warned against
the Democratic efforts to get control
of the House of Representatives.
UKIAH, Oct. 24. â If enthusiasm and
a splendid organization are to be re
lied upon the claim of the Republican
leaders here that this county will give
a majority for Roosevelt and also for
Duncan McKinlay is well founded. Mc-
Kinlay addressed five meetings in this
section to-day and received a cordial
reception at each one, not alone from
the business and professional men, but
from the working people as well.
At an early hour this morning Mc-
Kinlay was driven from Willits to the
Irvine & Muir Comnany's lumber mill,
where he was introduced to every em
ploye personally. Later he delivered
a short address to them, the plant be
ing shut down for the purpose. Re
turning to town he boarded a gayly
decorated special train for a trip into
the redwoods, making his first stop at
the mill of the Northwestern Lumber
Company. All the employes of the
mill, about 200 in number, were as
sembled on the veranda of the board
ing-house and gave three hearty
cheers for McKinlay as the train
stopped. He spoke to the . men for
half an hour, his address eliciting
every mark of approval. After meet
ins the workmen the trip was re
sumed, the train running several miles
through the redwoods to the logging
camp, where more than 100 men ap
plauded the eloquent words of the
Congressional nominee. After working
hours the employes in the lumber yard
at Willits and others, numbering sev
eral hundred, listened to an address
by McKinlay at., the Willits depot.
Willits is more deeply interested in
the tariff than any other town in the
district, the town being dependent
upon the lumber industry.

PERSONAL.
Gallahan was shot to death this
afternoon in a revolver duel, and hi3
body shows the deadly effect of the bul
lets that were fired at him at short
range. An ugly gash in the right side
of the throat was made by one ball
as it tore its way through his neck,
severing his jugular vein. Another bul
let entered the left eye and was evi
dently lodged in the. brain, no sign Of
exit being found. Either of the wounds
would have been fatal. Near Gallahan
lay his empty revolver.
Fuller Is said to have threatened to
kill Gallahan. declaring Gallahan
would be in his coffln before next
Christmas eve and that leads the offi
cers to believe he is the man they want.
Gallahan some time ago suspected
that scone one was robbing the sluices
of his placer workings and watched for
the robber. Early one morning he
caught Fuller in the act of robbing the
boxes and severely beat him. Gallahan
at another time found his house had
been broken Into. He could not dis
cover that anything was missing and
prepared as usual his supper. On sip
ping his coffee Gallahan noticed a
peculiar taste and. becoming 'suspicious,
began an investigation, resulting in the
discovery of large quantities of strych
nine in the sugar and coffee.
BUTTE, Mont. Oct. 24. â Henry J.
Gallahan, Federal Court Ballff, Civil

taking rooms as the result of at least
the second attempt on his life in the
last month. Miles Fuller, another placer
miner, whose reputation has been bad.
is a prisoner charged with the murder.
GRANTS PASS. Ore., Oct. 24.âPrep
arations are being made by prospective
settlers, buyers and squatters for a
great rush into the Southern Oregon
forest reserve lands, which are to be
thrown open for entry and settlement
in the near future. These lands cover
a vast area In Josephine, Jackson and
Curry counties and a part of Northern
California counties, notably Siskiyou
and Del Norte. While much of it is
mountainous and some of it is cov
ered with sparse timber, the greater
portion is densely covered with nr and
pine, with Â¦ considerable sugar pine,
which ranks with the famous redwood
in point of general value.
Already men are coming in here and
are preparing to take to the woods on
the first {definite information that the
lands are released. Cruisers have
placed a number of scuatters on the
more valuable lands, and other sections
will be taken up rapidly, as the num
ber of mills and the great demand for
lumber makes timber lands of great
value, even in the more remote parts.
Some of the land is vet unsurveyed.
Just what day the lands will be
thrown open Is not yet known, but no
tice has - already been given from
Washington that the reserves are soon
to be opened for settler and buyers.

VOTERS MEET HAYES.
The Republican rStltfe Central Com
mittee was not sure -that Bell himself
was claiming all the credit for the col
lier until the stenographic report of the
Woodland speech was secured, but the
committee knew full well that the
Democratic press was clothing him
with credit for an achievement that
he did not accomplish. Late on Satur
day afternoon, October 15, the com
mittee engaged a stenographer to at
tend the Democratic meeting at Wood
land on the night of that day and take
a verbatim ' report of Bell's speech.
Something definite was then obtained
to submit to Senator Perkins and others
of the Republican Congressional dele
gation. The Democratic claim has now
dwindled down to a subdued contention
that Bell "conceived the idea" of in
troducing an amendment. Â«-
Duncan E. McKinlay, Republican
nominee In the Second District, is dis
playing qualities of leadership that
challenge the admiration of the people
and enlist the special enthusiasm and
support of young men. He never ut
ters a word derogatory of his oppon
ent's private life or personal character.
He quotes the record of the two great
political parties and appeals to the in
telligence of the people for support.
FINDING THE GOODS.
The campaign in the First Congres
sional District is progressing in a man
ner highly gratifying to the Republican
State Central Committee. The people
everywhere manifest their high regard
for the ability and integrity of J. N.
Gillett. It is ascertained that A. Cami
netti, who reluctantly accepted the
Democratic nomination, is badly dis
couraged. Speaking of Camlnetti, the
Humboldt Times asks:
Was not Mr. Caminetti one of the very fel
lows that voted for a free trade measure that
rendered the people of this great country bank
rupt fcr four years? Would not Mr. Caml
netti, if h<* had another opportunity, cast his
vote against our Interests again?
The Democrats of the Second Dis
trict display signals of distress. The
Oakland Tribune remarks:
Congressman Bell Is now In a position to
sympathize " with the parrot that talked too
much. His free u*e of his tongue has got him
into trouble. His attempt to appropriate to
himself the credit of having one of the new
Government colliers built at Mare Island has
brought out a statement of the facts from
Scr.utor Perkins that make* Mr. Bell look
rather small. â¢ The amendment to the bill was
inserted In the Senate at the Instance of Sena
tor Perkins. Mr. Bell made a speech in Its
favor in the House, but he would have had
nothing to talk about if Senator Perkins had
not secured the Insertion of the amendment, j
A plurality of 1000 for E. A. Hayes in
tlie Thirty-seventh is expected. The
nominee for Congress is developing
speed and ability as a campaigner.

SHOWS PARKER'S -ERRORS:
ESOPUS, N. T., Oct. 24.â Judge Par
ker to-day laid aside the issues usually
discussed in national political contests
and addressed a crowd of several hun
dred persons on the general topic of
campaign practices and abuses. He re
buked the present administration for
the part Government officials were al
leged to be taking in the campaign.
He charged that the officers of jthe
Government were now practically
chosen by a handful of corporate man
agers, who contributed the assets of
the corporations to keep the conduct of
the Government in the hands they con
sider best for their private interests.
Said he:
Appreciating the responsibility put upon me
by the Democratic party, and the duty which
acceptance imposed upon me. I have care
fully considered the utterance' I am about to
make, and am well persuaded that, had a situ
ation calling for Its consideration been at the
time presented. It would have met the full ap
pro\-al of the convention as It will now meet I
the approval of every thoughtful, right minded
citizen of the United States, without regard to
party creed or party prejudice.
Many years have passed since my active
participation in politics. In the meantime a
startling change has taken place in the method
of conducting campaigns â a change not for
the better, but for the worse: a change that
has introduced debasing and corrupt methods
which threaten the Integrity of our country,
leaving it, perhaps, a republic in form, but not
a republic in substance; no longer a govern
ment of the people, by the people and for the
people, but a government whose officers are
practically chosen by a handful of corporate
managers, who levy upon the assets of the
stockholders whom they represent such sums'
of money as they deem requisite to place the
conduct of the Government In such hands as
they consider best for their private Interests.
PATRIOTISM AND FAVORITISM.
I make no complaint, nor should complaint
be made, of any Individual who contributes
toward the many legitimate expenses of a
great campaign. The capitalist, as an Indi- Â¦
vldual, has as much right to contribute to
ruch purposes and In proportion to his means
as has his less wealthy fellow-eitizen. What
ever he may do. based on a patriotic desire
to help elect the candidates of that party
which It seems to him will serve the b?st In
terests of the country, should be encouraged.
Equally is it true that all right thinking
men favor the encouragement of thrift, accu
mulation of property and Its due and just pro
tection, and they are equally opposed to either
the saying or doing of anything that will ar
ray one class against another. All classes are
mutually dependent upon and mutually help
ful to each other, and no word or act of mine
shall cause a gulf to be opened between them.
But there is a wide difference between an
individual employing his wealth In the manner
authorized by law and individuals or corpora
tions who operate in defiance cf law. The first
is independent of. the latter dependent upon
government favoritism. It is but a little while
t-lnce the body of the people at large pro
vided the legitimate expenses of a campaign.
Then farmer and lawyer, doctor and mechanic,
day laborer and banker each contributed Eome
thing toward the erection of banners, the
circulation of literature and the expenses of
public meetings. Each contributor was a bet
ter citizen for it. It stimulated his patriotism
and the contributions were devoted to the le
gitimate advancement of J.he cause, not made
lor the deliberate corruption of masses of
electors.
Gradually and, alas! effectually, but surely
not permanently, has all this been changed.
Some of the enterprises which have unduly
thrived through favoritism and which have
bÂ«?en permitted by statute to Indirectly levy
tribute en ths people, have in the course of time
become so rich and strong that they can and
do contribute vast sums when It Is made clear
that it will be an advantage to them, and they
contribute upon the promise, direct or Implied,
that thty shall be permitted to continue to tax
the people for their own benefit. Upon such
promises contributions have been not Infre
quently made in such large measure as to In
duce and procure colonization, repeating and
bribery in doubtful States.
VOTERS WITH A PRICE.
This has built up a class of voters known to
lccai leaders as â¢â¢floaters." a class so numerous
that party canvarsers allot to them in their
canvass -books a j^paraje column headed with
that name. This condition is recognized by
party workers, local. State and national. They
arc no longer checked by it. It has become so
prevalent that they are becoming hardened to
It. They *ometime* wonder where H Is to
end. but under the stress of a campaign they
postpone consideration until the next election.
1 am persuaded the time to begin the fight
against those who would control the results of
elections for their private corporate interests,
as distinguished from the public interests. Is
now. and. whatever the result of the electicn
may be, it should be continued until the evil
is cht-cked.
The excessively protected Interests, which
formerly poured out their treasure in order
to continue existing laws and procure the
passage of new laws permitting Its further
accumulation, have been joined by the-com
bination popularly called trusts. Their plan
is to perpetuate the present administration.
Such of the combinations or trust* as do not
profit by the aid of the tariff secure their
profits by the exercise of monopolies. Hence
their officers are opposed to the enforcement
of the law against/ them.
When such forces unite to furnish the
money which they are promised will control
"the election, their purpose, is as clear as
noonday. It is to buy election material to
purchase four year* cf profit by taxation or
four year* more of extortion from the public
by mears of monopoly.
Political contributions by corporations and
trust* mean corruption. They cannot be hon
est. Merely business interests are moved by
merely business considerations. A corporation
Â¦will subscribe to a political party only because
the corporation expects that party, through
Its control of. public officers, executive cr
legislative, to do something for the benefit
of the corporation or to restrain from doing
â¢omcthine to its Injury. No other motive
can be imagined. In the nature of things no
other motive can exist. The relations estab
lished mean the expectation, if not agree
ment, actual or implied, that governmental
action is to be Influenced by and for cor
porate Interest*. No sophistry can give any
other aÂ«p*ct to the transaction In the mind?
of reasonable men.
PUTS A FEW QUESTIONS.
Let the defenders of the practice, if it has
defenders, answer these questions:
Why do corporations and trusts subscribe
to political campaign*?
What would a trust think of a party which,
after accepting from the trust a campaign
contribution of I500.0C0. should permit the
party'* representatives in office to take action
Inimical to the trusts?
Would the public Interests be safe in the
hands of a party the greater part of whose
campaign funds had been contributed by* cor
porations and trust*?
If the public welfare- and the Interests of
eubscrlbtng corporations or trust* should con
flict, which would likely be protected?
The Â«cneme of our Government opposes fa
voritism, but in Its administration there has
I been much of it. Indeed. It has been growing
: with such rapidity In recent year* that those
â¢ few who have enjoyed favors contributed either
: directly by statute or indirectly by the non
prosecution of violations of law represent, con
trol and representing many millions of dollar*.
These interest* have decided to attempt to con
tinue the present administration In power.
Their representatives scolded about the Presi
dent several month* ago and thu* contributed
their part to the effort which was assiduously
made to satisfy the country that the trusts
â¢were opposed Ho the present administration.
Whether there* were real difficulties between
these great power* and the administration â
difficulties which have since been settled to
the *ati*factlon of all parties concerned â or
whether there were no difficulties to be com
promised and adjusted, their action being but
a play to deceive the voters, the fact remains
that the trusts are not now opposed to the
continuance of the present administration. On
the contrary, it iÂ» common knowledge that
they have decided to furnish .such a sum of
money to the Republican National Committee
as it is hoped will secure the "floaters" in
I the doubtful States for tbe Republican ticket.
Such an attempt constitutes both a menace
and a cBallenga to every patriotic and law
abiding person In this country, a* challenge
which ougtat to be accepted. The question
ought to be eettled now whether the "floaters"
and illegal combination* can together control
an election In this campaign.
Such a contest means, on one side, vaet sums
of money and every man with .in Itching palm.
It ought to array every honÂ«?*t. independent
and patriotic citlien on the other side.

If Judge Parker would apply to the Treas
ury Department for information as to the
methods of Government business and the con
dition of the public finances he would get
prompt and accurate Information and avoid the
embarrassment of being led Into very palpable
errors.
Mr. Parker has evidently been led Into an
error on that point. He seems to think thai
the current monthly expense accounts have
eome relation to these estimates. These esti
mates have no relation whatever to present ex
penses. They simply represent the sums that
Congress will be asked to appropriate to meet
the expenses of the various departments for
the fiscal year beginning July IS, 1905, 'and
June 30. 1906.
to-day issued a statement in part as
follows:
The attention of the department haa been
called to the statement twice made by Judge
Parker that thÂ«re have been administration
orders forbidding the publication of Informa
tion concerning Government expenditures. This
is a mistake. Mr. Parker seems to have un
fortunately acquired from untrustworthy
sources considerable misinformation, especially
about the management of the Treasury De
partment and especially about orders Issued
to govern departmental action generally.
Tbe only order Issued concerning estimated
expenditures was that no subordinate should
make any. estimates public until the heads of
the departments had gone over them with the
President and they had been approved. Before
Mr. Parker' had made his second statement in
reference to an order to withhold Information
the Postofflce, Interior and Agricultural de
partments and the District of Columbia had
rr.ade and published their estimates. The esti
mates from the other departments will be
given out In the ordinary course of business
as soon as they are made and approved, just
as they have been In previous years. The
practice of the departments in this respect has
not been in any manner departed from this
year.

OPERATIONS A FAD.
Public Gradually Awakens to the Fact
The latest fad in operations has been
the appendicitis fad; before that the
fad for rectal operataions (piles, etc)
held sway. Hundreds of patients were
frightened and hurried into hospitals,
operated upon and robbed of their last
collar, when the trouble was a simple
case of hemorrhoids or piles only,
e&slly cured at home with a simple
remedy eoetinc but fifty cents a box.
~I procured one fifty cent box of
Pyramid Pile Cure of my druggist.
T.ith the intention of buying & larger
box later, but was happily surprised
when I found that I was cured, and
ctill have six pyramids left out of the
f.rfat and only box. 1 have not had
the least sign of piles since I used this
one dot, which has been about two
months: previous to using Pyramid
Pile Cure I had the worst kind of
bleeding and protruding: piles for over
thirty-one years, and no one knows,
except those who have had the piles,
the pain and misery I suffered.
"I- cm a poor man. but have -often
said I would give a fortune, if I had
It, to be cured of the piles, and now I
have been cured for fifty cents. I
should be very ungrateful if I did not
thank you and give you every priv-
ilege to use my name and this letter,
when I know there are so many who
suffer as I did." J. A. Weismiller, 1100

will be erlad to mail free to any appli-
cant, and we advise all sufferers from
tills painful disease to write to them
tor it.

SEATTLE, Oct 24.â Seattle's errors
were not only costly but came so fast
that It was difficult to chalk them
down. For three innings it did not
make any difference who got hold of
the ball, a misplay followed. Newton
pitched a steady game and was master
of the situation at all times. He was
well supported all around. Hewlett,
formerly a Pacific National * League
player, will hold down third for Seattle
during the remainder of the season.
There has been a big hole at third.

AGAIN WINS HONORS
AT THE PARK COURTS
Miss Santa Van Vliet Victorious De
spite Heavy Odds Offered Op
ponent Tennis Players.
Miss Santa Van Vliet, the clever
young tennis player from the Presidio,
again carried off the third class hon
ors at the park courts. Having won
the cup when it was last played for
she was again allowed to play in this
class. She had. to give . all her op
ponents the large odds of "30." De
spite this handicap she went through
the class without losing a set She
allowed Miss G. Sayler odds of "30"
yesterday and lost only one game in
two sets. The score was 6-0, 6-1.
Miss Van Vliet will be allowed to
play In the third class until she wins
the cup three times. She has already
won it twice. She belongs properly
to the first class and It is doubtful if
there is a lady player at the park who
can beat her. Miss Van Vliet is the
daughter of Major Van' Vliet a well
known . athlete and clever tennis
player. '
The young ladies will participate in
another tournament on Saturday.

Eddie Graney was appointed referee
"of the Britt-Gans fight by James Cof
froth, manager of the Shasta Club, at
Harry Corbetfs last night. Al Herford
accented him with as good gTace as a
child swallowing- castor oil. â¢
"But" insisted Gana* manager,
"Spider Kelly must be kept quiet. I've
got no objections to Spider, but he's
noisy. I want a penalty. leviedNon any
man in the Britt corner that makes a
disturbance. Spider can hypnotize a
house and raise a demonstration that
might influence a local referee."
"You're on," agreed Impresario
Brother William Britt. "And the pen
alty applies to any man in . the Gans
corner who gets too gay with the chln
muslc."
PEXAI/rr OX "SPIDER."*
"It applies to Spider Kelly wherever
he is," insisted Herford. "Make the
penalty $1000 and put it on paper."
"The penalty goes with me," agreed
Willie Britt. But it was not put in
black and white, James Coffroth guar
anteeing that no overenthusiastic dem
onstration in corners would be permit
ted.
The conference started late and pro
ceeded like an ice wagon. Willie Britt
Insisted on a local man. naming Graney
and Eddie Smith. Herford looked tired
and changed the subject. The talk
switched to automobiles and pink teas.
Willie stalled and Herford kidded; Wil
lie beefed and Herford hummed. The
hands of the clock went round and
round and the conference looked sleepy.
Mike Fisher, manager and trainer of
the Tacoma Tigers, was a visitor to
It was J. Coffroth to the rescue.
"There's been more trouble about se
lecting a referee for this fight than any
I have ever heard of," he said. "I ap
point Eddie Graney, a man that I know
and that all San Francisco knows. Will
you take him, Herford?"
The manager of Gans looked as
though he was asked to swallow a
strychnine capsule. "All right," he
said, "but Spider Kelly has got to keep
quiet." :.>.'.-;<.-:
Billy Roach, who was regarded as a
candidate for referee, was present when
the conference opened but departed
when the talk began to lag. Britt ad
mitted at one time that he would stand
for Jim Morrison of Seattle if a suitable
local man could not be selected. Mc-
Carey of Los Angeles wired suggesting
Charles Eyton.
FISHER VISITS BRITT.
Jimmy Britt's quarters at Croll's Gar
dens in Alameda yesterday. The base
ball magnate waa so well impressed
with the little fighter's appearance
that he ventured the remark that he
considered Biitt good enough to be
come a member of his champion base
hit sluggers. Fisher was accompanied
by a delegation of other sporting men.
who observed Jimmy critically as he
went through his usual gymnasium
work. This Included four rounds of
boxing with Frank Rafael and bouts
with the punching bag and medicine
ball. The skipping rope was also
brought into play and Britt'went over
it several hundred times with the
grace of a ballet dancer. .
In the morning Britt covered eight
miles on the road and after returning
took to the mat, where he wrestled
vigorously for twenty minutes with
-Tiv" Kreling. Spider Kelly was ex
pected to. take charge of Britt's camp
yesterday, but was unable to do so be
cause of illness. He Intends to go over
to Alameda to-day, there to remain
until Britt shall have completed his
training 1 .
Joe Gans started his last week's
training for his battle with Jimmy
Britt at Billy Shannon's villa yester
day. Joe was at it hammer and tongs
and displayed more vim and energy
than he has shown during the present
siege of training.
The nearer the date of the fight the
happier Joe becomes.
He was up at daylight this morning
and took a jog to Corte Madera and
back, a distance of twelve miles. After
a brisk rubdown he sauntered around
the camp singing the latest songs and
joshing his training mates.
After lunch he got busy In the nan
and showed a strong desire to work.
SO3IE FAST TRAINING.
He was scheduled to box four rounds
with Kid Sullivan, but at the expira
tion of the bout he begged the kid to
make it ten rounds. The kid. who
was very tired, hesitated, but finally
relented. The pair again went at it In
a furious manner, but at the end of
the seventh round Sullivan begged off.
The champion then did his usual gym
stunts. He Jumped the rope 800 times,
punched the bag and medicine bag,
pulled the weights and twisted the
wrist machine. A stiff rundown fol
lowed. Gans still weighs in the neigh
borhood of 13414 pounds.
When asked about that all impor
tant weight question he answers with
a grin, "Easy."

WORTH SELECTIONS.
CHICAGO, Oct. 24.â Only a small
sized crowd attended the races at
Worth this afternoon. There was an
ordinary card, and the cold, disagree
able weather served to keep all but
the regulars away. The sensation of
the afternoon came in the third race
when The Crisis, an odds-on favorite,
was defeated by New Mown Hay.
Rough riding, which went unnoticed
by the Judges, won the race for New
Mown Hay, backed from 16 to 5 down
to 14 to 5. Head and head at the far
turn, Robbins, who rode New Mown
Hay, evidently pulled In on the favor
ite, causing Hoffier to pull up on The
Crisis and the filly, fell back to fourth
place. New Mown. Hay then went on,
taking a good lead In the stretch and
was never headed, winning by two
lengths. After recovering from the
interference. The Crisis closed stoutly
and took second place easily. Sum

to suit that old gelding. . He is the
legitimate successor to the once fa
mous Barnum and the no less well
remembered Blitzen, both known as
"iron horses" in their respective peri
ods and both now approached in point
of popularity by Carbuncle, who is
noted for having one run, which, if
the pace is not too fast, usually lands
him somewhere near the front.
The pood thing in Carbuncle's race
to-day was the much improved Ethics,
which, it was reported, was brought
over from the Gravesend course for a
"killing." War Whoop was able to
make the pace very fast The finish
was much closer than was anticipated,

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 24.â The Chronicle
said to-day:
"Sam Berger, the amateur heavy
weight - champion, of San Francisco,*
who passed through St. Louis on his
way to the coast yesterday, is seriously
considering the advisability of becom
ing a professional. It is reported he
is arranging a match with 'Kid' McCoy
or 'Philadelphia Jack* O'Brien. He
says he has an offer to meet McCoy
in San Francisco.
"In that case, Berger better have
his measurements taken immediately
for a coffin. Berger' has as much li
cense to Join the professional heavy
weight class as Abe Attell has to meet
Jeffries. Berger is the poorest sample
of an amateur heavyweight champion
that ever entered the ring. Â« If the
Calif ornian decides to 'Jump' to the
'pro' camp; and succeeds in getting on
with ; McCoy or O'Brien, It would not
surprise followers of the game who
witnessed his exhibition in the recent
tournament if he also annexed; the
'running broad Jump* record about the
time the gong rang for the first
round."

Columbus, Ohio, Hay 20, 1903.
Six years ago I had a severe attack of
Inflammatory Rheumatism. I was laid tip
in bed for six months, and the doctors I
bad did me no good. They changed med-
icines every week and nothing they pre-
scribed seemed to help me. Finally I be-
pan the use of S. S. S. My knee and! elbow
joints were swollen terribly, and at one
tick my joints were so swollen and pain-
ful that I could not close them when
opened. I was so bad that I could not
move knee or foot. I was-getting discour-
aged, yon may be sure, when I began S. S.
S. , but as I saw it was helping me I contin-
ued it, and to-day I am a sound well "Â»n
and have never had a return of the disease.
S. S. S. purified my blood and cured me
of this severe case of Rheumatism after
everything else had failed. I have rec-
coramended . it to others with good re-
sults. R. H. Chapman.

The poisonous adds that produce the in-
flammation and pain are absorbed into the
blood and Rheumatism can never be con-
quered till these are neutralized and fil-
tered out of the blood and system. S. S. S.
goes directly into the circulation and at-
tacks the disease itself. It purifies and re-
f tores the blood to a healthy, . vigorous
condition. It contains no potash, alkali or

HONOLULU, Oct. 18. â A vigorous
earthquake shock awoke the people
of Honolulu on the morninsr of Octo
ber 14 at 3:45 o'clock. The shock was
the most severe felt in years on this
island. People were awakened by a
violent shaking: of couches and beds.
The wave seems to have passed from
a southeasterly direction to the north
west or vice versa. --; The earthquake
was general througnout the islands.' ~ :
â¢ The quake was felt at sea and the
barkentlne Encore, which arrived on
the same morning from Newcastle,
wris the first vessel to report having
experienced it. The peculiar move
ment occurred while the vessel was
about fifteen' miles off the southeast
end of Molokal. It was sufficient to
wake Captain Palmgren from his bunk
and cause him' to hurry on deck. The
marine disturbance first started' with
a noise and then the vessel trembled
violently. It sounded to Captain Palm
gren as if the vessel was scraping over
a sand bottom. ' He thought at first
she had gone aground.
Accompanied by Noise, It Caused Cap
,tain to Think That Ship
Had Grounded.

BOSTON, Oct. 24.â The annore^
cruiser Colorado, built for the United
States navy by William Cramp & Sons
of Philadelphia, to-day In her official
trial covered SS nautical miles in three
hours 57 minutes and 7 seconds, main
taining an hourly average speed of
22.26 knots throughout the run, ex
ceeding the speed of 22 knots called for
in the builders' contract by more than
a quarter of a knot. It is believed that
tide corrections will increase her aver
age slightly. The highest speed devel
oped was 23.33 knots and this was
maintained for six and six-tenths miles
during the homeward run.
To-day's performance rates the Colo
rado as the fastest vessel In the armor
ed cruiser. class and one of the fastest
In the navy, the only large American
ships that have ever exceeded her
speed being the .Columbia and the Min
neapolis. The engines worked smooth
ly and developed an average horse
power of 28,000 and the ponderous twin
screws whirled at an average of 12S
revolutions a minute - and at times
made 130 revolutions. The great ship
responded to the slightest touch on her
helm. ",&}Â¦Â£â¢Â¦
The trial was held over the usual
New England course. Sarting off Cape
Ann the vessel steamed 44 knots up the
coast to Cape. Porpoise, Maine, made
a brilliant turn and then started on the
run back to Cape Ann.
The weather conditions were excel
lent. The air was clear, a light wind
blew from the northwest and the sea
was very smooth. r
Eight vessels of the United States
navy were anchored as stake boats
along the course.
In turning the "Figure 8," and in
other maneuvering tests the ship gave
splendid satisfaction, particularly in
the complete turn which she made In a
circle diameter which was a little less
than twice the length of the cruiser.

Tag Unadllla Agronnd.
In the thick fog oa the bay yesterday the tug
Unadilla, from Mare Island on her way to this
city, went aground in shoal water at 1 p. m.
Just east of Angel Island. The pilot lost his
bearings, ail bell* and v.histles sounded alike
to him. and the current carried him westward
into shallow water. It was high tide, Â¦â¢"'1 the
water receding left the pretty naval boat hard
and Cast. The fog lifting, she was seen by the
rix-er Bteamer Corcoran, which tried to pull her
Into de?p water. The Unadllla could not be
moved and the General Frirble came along
and took a hand. The combined engines of the
two strong steamers failed and the grounded
vessel was left in her bed of mud with her
forefoot entirely out of water. Late last even
ing the powerful tug Dauntless of the gpreckels
line attempted to drag the Unadllla off the
t r.cfcl, but could not do so. The stranded vessel
is resting easy on the sand, and it is thought
that at high water the nary yard tugs m-ill
fucceed in getting her off without any serious
damage to her hull.

Dr. Brown declared that although
Chicago is the healthiest of the big
cities of the world, it is distinctly a
catarrhal city' He said pneumonia
is the "death king" in Chicago.
Characterizing Chicago as "a city of
coughs and colds," Dr. Richard H.
Brown of the University of Illinois
told the members of the Woman's
Club of Settlement House how to
avoid catching cold and what to do
after colds are caught, says the Chi
cago Tribune. His subject was
"Coughs."
Dr. Brown laid down the following
rules for the prevention of coughs and
colds:
Avoid spitters.
Sleep with the wlnddws open.
Make yourself an oak Instead of an
orchid.
Keep the air indoors as pure as the
air outdoors.
Do not let the temperature of your
room get above 70 degrees.
Do not wear too much clothing, but
Just enough to, keep warm.

KNIGHTS and Ladies of Courtesy is the name of an order re
cently established in Chicago, whose mission is self evident.
Its grand officers are represented by the Lord High Optimist
and the Master Pessimist. Their duties are "to keep a keen watch
over the state of the social amenities and to report respectively upon
the symptoms of improvement and decadence in the public and pri
vate manners of the community." Membership in the society is not
restricted by conditions of race or color.
â¢ The knights and ladies certainly have work cut out for them.
Where to begin must be the question demanding immediate execu
tive session. Already we hear the Master Pessimist submitting a
report upon the lady who is just "picking up" the piano on the third
floor front of the. six story flat, upon the fellow who. smokes Connec
ticut stogies on the crowded platform of the street; car, upon that
consummate bore who stops you on the street to tell you about the

JUDGE PARKER has made a speech from the porch at Esopus.
He first listened to six speeches fired at him by six orators of
six clubs from New. York City, then he rose and uttered him
self on the tariff. If his speech were printed parallel with the Demo
cratic speeches of 1892 it would reveal the same arguments and the
same accusations against the protective policy. These prevailed in
1892 and in due time the Democratic party went at tariff reform.
'After months of wrangling, in which it was developed that each
statesman of that party wanted protection for the industrial products
of his own district and free trade in the products of the districts of
other statesmen, the Wilson bill issued from a Democratic Congress
such a distorted and disfigured measure that President Cleveland re
fused to .sign it and denounced it as "a record of fraud and dis
honor."
Well, the fraud and dishonor Democratic taritf gut in its deadlv
iwork on the industries of the country, and v.orkinj^men were in
troduced to riotous living in charity souphouses. We had armies
of the unempl Â»ycd, marching some nowhere and some on Washing
ton and some into jail. Mills were silent and millions were howling
for bread. The fall in the consuming power of the country brought
prices below the cost of production and the distress spread to the
farms, where it was relieved temporarily by that non-porous plaster
called a mortgage.
' With .McKinley's election these conditions disappeared and have
not come back. Industry revived. Americans quit a soup diet for
meat and charity for self-support. As the consuming power of the
country rose prices advanced far enough above the cost of pro
duction to enable farmers to get rid of their non-porous plasters. The
farm mortgages have been paid off and carloads of these canceled
instruments have been exhibited at State and county fairs as sou
venirs of the tariff of fraud and dishonor and exhibits of the pros
perity that followed a return of protection. . Now Judge Parker wakes
the echoes of Esopus with the same old arguments as the representa
tive of the party that tinkered American workmen out of a job, out
of a home, and into Coxey's armies and the souphouse.
PARKER AND PROTECTION.
It is not always age that make:; those
disagreeable furrows across our Tore
heads and round our eyes. There are
some grandmothers whose faces have
hardly a wrinkle, and some grand
daughters whose brows are as seamed
as they might be at sixty, says the
Chicago Journal.
Time is not responsible for these vex
ing little lines. A good many of them
may be charged up against worry. If
one gets in the way of fretting over
everything that has gone wrong, and
everything one thinks likely to go
wrong, the record upon one's face will
be as plain as print. Bad temper
makes a mark which is hard to eras!,
and Is far uglier than the lines the
happy years bring.
Age cannot wrinkle the heart. Even
when the face is criss-crossed with the
tracery of a long lifetime, the spirit may
be as young as ever. But fretfulness
and 111 temper make wrinkles within
as well as without. The . little im
patient line, hardly noticeable on a
smooth forehead, means that a deep
furrow has been plowed in the heart.
All women of good taste, no matter
whether they be heiresses or work to
support themselves, never adopt the
extreme of any fashion. The long front

women, would still be in favor if it
had not been overdone by women of
poor taste. The lines of the figure are
Improved by the cutting of the bodice
a trifle long and lifting the skirt band
a trifle in the back. The extreme style,
however, is in decidedly bad taste.

To have to sit in silence when he yearns to cheerily chat.
'Twill surely take a 'person with a huge, cast-Iron", will
To undertake this mighty task of keeping Parker still!
Of course, 'twill be a good deal like the squelching of a

COPYRIGHT. 1901. BY SPECIAL. ARRANGEMENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. "WITH THE NEW YORK EVENING MAIL.
r "p<HE firing on an English fishing fleet and the murder and maim
! ing of several of the crew is another act of Russian piracy
which can be accounted for only upon the theory that the Rus
sians are recklessly desirous of destroying the peace of the world,
or that the officers of the Baltic fleet are panic stricken cowards.
Count Cassini, Russian Minister at Washington, calls it a
deplorable accident, due to belief on the part of the fleet admiral
that the fishing boats were a hostile Japanese fleet about to attack.
This is not a tenable explanation, for the 'fishing fleet was swept by
powerful searchlights before the firing began. The crews were all
on deck, cleaning fish, and were plainly discernible from the war
ships, for the fishermen saw the Russians on the decks of their
ships and held up fish to them to show the peaceful nature of
their occupation. The fishing boats also displayed the regulation
lights and signals spelling their occupation and defining their char
acter. These signals are in the maritime code and are known readily
by the naval officers of all nations and by all sailors.
The firing upon the defenseless boats 'after this exposition of
their class and their inspection by means of searchlights was the
act of cowards, or it was in pursuance of a deliberate .plan to com
mit an act of war. A man-of-war can be guilty of an act of piracy
and is not protected by its commission as, a warship. In any of its
aspects and in any light thrown upon \% so far by the Russian Le
frations at Washington and London it was wanton piracy, and a vio
lation of the British flag. In London the Russian legation explains
that the fleet was probably at target practice and hit the fishing
boats by accident. But night at sea, with no prepared target to
shoot at, is a strange time for target practice. If this act were fol
lowed, as is reported, by the boarding of a British merchantman in
the Straits of Dover, the complications are increased and the wan
tonness of Russia is intensified. We know what would happen in
this country if our Gloucester fishing fleet on the banks were at
tacked as were the English fishing boats of Hull in the North Sea.
Unless the most abject apology and punitive reparation were made
within' forty-eight hours, American spirit would put its commands on
the executive for an immediate extra session of Congress to prepare
for a reprisal that would make teeth chatter on the Neva.
No self-respecting nation can permit such invasion" of its rights
and contempt of its flag. The British empire may well consider it
as the symptom of the approach of a crisis. The British isles have
been for some time infested by German spies, disguised as work
men, who are believed to have been noting the conditions of military
defense, the location of supply depots and everything that goes into
the resistance of an invasion. The Kaiser and the Czar have for
some time been suspected of a secret entente, which is reasonable,
in view of the German seizure of Chinese territory on the Gulf of
Pechili, and the desire of the Kaiser to extend his possessions in
that quarter. If such entente exist, it would naturally be intended
to appear in an open alliance against Great Britain, upon the ap
pearance of war between that empire and Russia.
The combined navies of Germany and Russia have 696 ships of
all classes, and a fighting force of 96,415 men. The combined na
vies of Great Britain and Japan have 834 ships, of all classes, and a
fighting force of 131,998 men. These figures do not entirely reveal
the capacity of the forces. Without going to guns and 4 .rnnage, the
relative efficiency of the four navies is revealed, to a degree, by the
money spent to maintain them in trim for use. The combined naval
expenditures of Great Britain and Japan per annum are $160,080,000.
The combined expenditures of Russia and Germany for the same
purpose are $71,525,267. These expenditures go not only into the
character of the vessels and their efficiency as ships, but ir.to guns,
men, practice and accumulated munitions of war. As the fight
would be a sea war, and whichever commanded the ocean will win, if
is apparent that Russia and her possible ally would have to depend
on something more than holy ikons and the promptings of destiny.

MATRIMONIAL TROUBLES
OF THE KOHXS AT AN" END
The fight ; continued for some min
utes, the Junk dealer standing para
lyzed with â¢ fright and offering no as-,
sistance to' the officer. As the three
men swayed back and. forth they
came .'in contacf with the ; shelves
knocking down a lot of iron pipe. In
the scuffle Franklin's pal' broke loose
and ran up Mission to' Eighth and
down the latter, street to Howard,
where he was lost to view.
Taylor handcuffed Franklin and
landed him in Jail and then went out
in search of the other crook, who was
wounded. He believes the man" was
badly injured. He traced a track of
blood to Eighth" and* Howard streets,
where it ceased. He had a good look
at the. other two men and expects
shortly to land -them In custody.'
All three men were between the ages
of 20 and 23 . years. Franklin is 23
years' old ! and- refuses' to tell who, his
confederates are "or. where the lead was
stolen from. He has been arrested be
fore on charges of burglary and rob
bery, j but escaped conviction.
Detective Charles Taylor had a des
perate fight shortly after 8 o'clock yes
terday morning, with, two thieves in
Cooper's jtink, shop, -1130 Mission street.
He, ripped .one man's scalp open . with
a blow from. an iron pipe and hand
cuff ed; the" other and --brought him to
the City Prison. The ! wounded crook
left a trail of blood for-two blocks, but
he was riot recaptured.- ' -\
Sunday .night .the [police received in
formation,, from Cooper * that, three
young men had sold him 220 pounds of
new* sheet: lead., The sale price was $5.
The junk .dealer 'paid them $1 75 and
they were to return yesterday morning
to , get the balance. When they ap
peared for the rest of the money Tay
lor was lying "in .wait for ithem. He
expected bub . one man,- as Cooper had
said nothing about three. Â¦Â¦
. As soon as the crooks entered the
store Taylor grabbed two of them,
husky youths, and attempted to hand
cuff them together. The third man ran
and made good his escape. A desper
ate fight ensued between the remaining
two - thieves ; and the officer. Taylor
threw one of them, Charles Franklin,
to the floor, at the same time keeping
his hold on the other. Franklin's
friend attempted to drag him from the
policeman's grasp, and began to pum
mel Taylor on the head. Taylor seized
a piece of iron pipe and dealt the crook
several vidious blows on the head,
tearing* his scalp so that a stream ot
blood spurted out.
The unusual, spectacle of a "man
charged . 'with , mental . lncompetehcy
prompting the witnesses: who appeared
against him, as to facts and figures,
and then addressing the 'court^ in* de
fense of his", own condition,
was seen yesterday .in Judgep Coff ey f s
court. The examination was "upon the
application of - Maria Maacke for ':, the
appointment of a guardian for her hus
band, Henry J.' Maacke, who, :she al
leges, is not able to care for,* himself
or his property. . V ,' :
Throughout the hearing, .whenever a
witness' memory, lapsed, Maacke sup
plfed the necessary. information. HeÂ»is
61 years old," and .for thirty-two r years
was employed -by ; Walter; & Co. | Four
years ago he -:Â¦ suff ered" 1 from i-,nervous
prostration and lost â¢ his ' positiOA; His
son-in-law, FYed Brune, ..got h him : a
place as doorkeeper, for the Mutual
1 Lithographing Company. Four or five
months ago Maacke's nature and con
i duct underwent a change and, accord
ing to several witnesses, he grew vio
lent in his language, talked of killing
j persons, and said he was going to take
i a trip to , Europe. |
I H. Brandon, shipping clerk for the
j lithographing company, testified that
j Maacke would leave his labors and
sweep the street, putting the dirt in
little piles, in the top of which he
would stick a flag "to stop the. dirt
wagons." It developed that he held his
son's note for $1200 and that of his. son
in-law for $1000.
After the evidence, Maacke, who is
being treated at a sanitarium, asked
the court's permission to speak in his
own behalf. Addressing "his Honor and
members of the profession," the man
read the allegations in his wife's pe
tition and then said, "My wife is the
last woman In the world to whom I
would intrust my property, because
she Is of a .very nervous temperament."
His children, he added, championed
their mother, whether she was right or
wrong; he thought they should not in
â¢terfere in affairs that were not their
business and* he never interfered with
them. He Insisted that instead of be
ing diseased he "was -a pretty healthy
looking man."
After this he produced a written
statement, and with all the grace of an
attorney at the bar, Bald; "I have some
thing more here, -your Honor, but as
this Is not a divorce case, perhaps It Is
not In your jurisdiction." The Judge
reached for the paper and read it. re
turning it to Maacke when it was fin
ished. It was then learned from his
attorney that Maacke will sue for dir
v-orce. y .

was held yesterday at Presbyterian
House, 920 Sacramento street. Rev.

the meeting, which -was. . largely at
tended. " 'i * ' f : : :k
j The Congregational- Ministers' Asso
ciation gave a hearty greeting.yester
day to Rev. Dr. Albert W. Clarlc'who
has acted as missionary of 'the Amer
ican Board of Missions in Bohemia for
thirty-two.years. Dr. Clark has found
ed/eighteen churches in Bohemia, Mo
ravia and Vienna,,; and also founded
the. first^ Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation in Prague, in 1886. The Austrian
Government, which was' at first in
clined to oppose the association,- not
knowing what such an organization
proposed to do,- now acknowledges that
the work helps to make better citizens
and. to-day, said the doctor, there are
eighteen Young IMen's Christian Asso

there are other branches of the asso

The* doctor,- "who/ {has" 'spent' "sixteen

ministers : some of the " conditions of : the
Mikado's -country."; . . . -.; ' .- '
Rich Japanese, he -said, : had. as yet
not rbeen called upon tb j contribute to
the - war, the j Government 1 deeming ," it
advisable to hold them back as a pow
erful r*e8er\ r e if needed. Japan' was pre
pared for "a three years*-war. Â¦.
In. speaking ,of the progress of Japan
Dr. Johnson- told of; that country's
young nien who had come to 'America
and Europe to receive -an education
and had returned filled with knowledge
of Western lands. They had then been
given positions of ,Â¦: importance and
trust, hence the progress of Japan.
'Another thing the doctor told that
was of interest. In' speaking of the
preparation of the V Japanese fighting
men, he said that every Japanese was
a , soldier at the age of 20, thoroughly
qualified as a fighting man, and, as in
Germany, might be drawn j upon for
war.

"TYPHOID FEVER."
"REXRADIO" ' quickly expels Typhoid
Fever. H. C. Knott, 112 Fen st, waa last
week prostrated with this deadly fever. His
symptoms were alarming, fever, extreme,
pulse. at highest, temperature excessive, vom-
ited "blood." At height ot fever Rexradlo's
first treatment quickly started a profuse
sweat, when ail extreme symptoms largely
subsided right away, pulse and temperature
became nearly normal. After second treat-
ment (same day) further copious sweating,
followed speedily by perfectly normal pulse
and temperature, and complete cessation of
blood vomiting. Patient became cool, easy,
restful.' slept long, soundly. Next morning
felt weak but well, and went out to transact
business all day. To date no relapse, and pa-
tient has quickly recuperated. To-day he
said: "I am feeling perfectly well. I owe
my wonderful recovery, and perhaps my
'life,' to Rexradlo's 'non-medical' treatment
alone. He used no medicine but just passed
his 'humanized Radium' power Into me, which
instantly thrilled my whole body, promptly
abating the severe pains and fever in a most
surprising manner, producing a refreshing
coolness and strength all over me. I am as-
tounded at my rapid and complete cure, and
as a small token of my practical gratitude I
have Insisted on Rexradio's acceptance of a
block of etock In a gold mine with which I
am connected. Language is too poor to ex-
press my appreciation of his truly marvelous
power. While he Is around I shall never
again dread 'Typhoid.' I am willing to
'swear* to the truth of the above statement"
"PHYSICIANS TESTIFY."
"REXRADIO" last week by one brief treat-
ment publicly restored many totally deaf ears,
some of which rera witnessed by one ot the
most noted city "physicians" (name at of-
fices), who. signed the testimony, vouching for
ltb correctness. Another physician brought a
"deaf mute," who In 3 seconds began to hear
and speak. A third physician, at hall, pub-
licly counseled alleged "Incurables" by medi-
cine to try Rexradlo's power. When these
"physicians" Indorse this treatment, "lay-
men" may do well to "investigate" it
" 'REXRADIO'S' one treatment entirely cured
the paralysis with which my baby was
'born.' "- Mrs. Allen, 379 Bartlett .
"REXRADIO" has . recently made several
"deaf mutes" hear and speak before numer-
ous witnesses. One case was witnessed by
Mr. Butler of the S. F. Chronicle, who
signed the record, vouching for its "correct,
ness."
" 'REXRADIO'S' 2 treatments reduced my
large cancer one-half." â Name at offices.

SIOUX CITY, Iowa, Oct. 24.â There
Is sorrow hereabouts, for the lateness
of frost has made the sauerkraut crop
a failure and Dutch, centers refuse to
be comforted. The crop was the larg
est ever raised in the State. After the
unprecedented yield of cabbage had
been minted It was discovered that lit
tle, slimy white snakes were all
through the kraut. Some of them are
a foot long.
Professor H. F. Summers, State En
tomologist, being appealed to. declared
the sauerkraut snake harmless. But
folk who did* not think he knew ate
some of the snaky kraut, and tri
umphantly became very sick.
The snakes are very slender, not
often so girthy as a match, and the
longest being twelve Inches "from tip
to tip."

vention will adjourn finally to-morrow.
In the house of Bishops the Bishop
of Dallas was chosen to prepare the
pastoral letter at the triennial conven
tion in 1907, and the Bishop of Cali
fornia and the Bishop of Vermont were
selected to consult with the Bishop of
Dallas In preparing the letter.
The report of a special committee
appointed early in the session to con
sider the subject of lynching was, with
almost unanimous consent, laid on the
table. *
Both houses have appointed a joint
commission to consider the advisabil
ity of selecting a presiding Bishop of
the church. As president the senior
Bishop occupies this position and It
Is claimed that the duties are too
heavy for an aged diocesan. The com
mission will report to the next con
vention.
The house of deputies to-day re
jected, after a long debate, a resolu
tion to strike out the words "Protestant
Episcopal" on the title page of the
common book of prayer.
A PRESIDING BISHOP.
The Bishops adopted an amendment
to a section referring to the admin
istration of sacraments, providing that
if a clergyman shall have reasonable*
cause to doubt whether a person hav
ing: married "otherwise than as tha
word of God and discipline of the Epis
copal church allow," auch clergyman
shall refer the matter to the Bishop
before administering the sacrament.
The deputies had made an exception
in favor of the "Innocent party di
vorced" on the ground of adultery who
had remarried, but the Bishops struck;
out the -exception. Their action was
accepted by the house of deputies to
day.
Leading churchmen expressed the
opinion that the restrictions placed
upon the remarriage of an Innocent
party to a divorce are so stringent that
the remarriage of divorced persons will
be rare in the church. It is under
stood, however, that an attempt will
be made to have the next convention
specifically declare against remarriage
under any conditions-
No minister knowingly, after duÂ« inquiry,
shall solemnize the marriags of any person
who has been or Is the husband or the wtfÂ«
of any other person then living from whom
he or she has been divorced for any causa
arising after marriage. But thla canon shall
not be held to apply to the Innocent party in
a divcrce for adultery; provided that befora
the application for such remarriage a period
of not less than one year shall have elapsed
after the granting of such divorce, and that
satisfactory evidence touching the facts In th->
case, including a copy of the court's decree
and record If practicable, with such proof
that the defendant was personally served or
appeared In the action, be laid before the ec
clesiastic authority, and such ecclesiastic au
thority, having taken advice thereon, shall
have declared In writing that. In his Judg
ment, the case of the applicant conforms to
the requirements of this canon, and. provided
further, that It shall be within the discretion
of any minister to decline to solemnize' any
marriage.
RESTRICTIONS STRINGENT.
BOSTON, Oct. 24.â An agrreement on
the divorce question was reached to
day by the House of Bishops and the
House of Deputies of the Episcopal
General Convention after many days
of discussion. That section of tha
canon bearing: directly on the remar
riage of divorced persons, which was
amended by the Bishops Saturday, as
sented to by the deputies to-day and
becomes effective at one*. Is as fol
lows:

Remarry After One Year
Under Certain Conditions

CHICAGO, Oct. 24.â Possibility cu war Be
tween Great Britain and Russiai had consid
erable Influence In causing Â¦ a strong wheat
market here to-day. Continued active milling
demand Â¦ was a . factor of almost equal impor
tance. ' â¢ Â¦ .
Shorts were active bidders for : both the De
cember and May. options when trading, began
in the wheat pit. As a result of the urgent
demand, initial quotations showed a material
advance/May being up He to %c at $1 14. to
$1 14%. December was a shade lower to %@
%c higher at $1 15 to $1 15%. This. anxiety
was due to a variety of reasons, in addition
to the continued bullishness of the cash situa
tion and possibly world-wide complications re
sulting from the Russian Baltic fleet incident.
Important features were decreases both in
Northwestern .'receipts and In the world's ship
ments. The fact that foreign grain markets
showed gains had considerable effect on the
market here.- At the start offerings were com
paratively light. In consequence : prices rose
rapidly,* December quickly selling up to $1 10
and May to $1 15%. Realizing sales checked
the. advance and. loaded the market with rough
wheat to cause a temporary loss of the greater
part of ths early improvement. Ths market
soon ' recovered from the setback, * however, - as
a result of active support from a leader of the
bull crowd. A sharp advance . in prices at
Minneapolis also contributed strength to the
situation hers. The Southwest ~ furnished an
addttloca^largs . volume of bullish news, , com
plaints . from Â¦ Missouri regarding . damage by
Hessian flies being. quite numerous.'- The high
point- on December for the day .was reached
at $1~16%. May again nold up to ?l 15%.
Some realizing developed later In the; 'session,
bat the market closed strong , with December
at $1 15%. Final quotations Â¦ on ; May .were at
$1 14%. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ â¢ , :.- = .',â¢ ,, Â¦-*â¢,-. Â¦ -;> ,-..

firm.' December closed Mo higher at 48%o. â¢
â¢ - The oat market was steady In spits of eon
â¢lderabls selling by cash houses. '-Â¦; December
closed unchanged at 28%o.

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORE. Oct. 24.â The tids of, specula
tive enthusiasm proved Itself sufficiently strong
:n to-day's Etock market to sweep up the usual
Monday morning realizing sales and to wipe
out the sentimental effect of the Anglo-Rus
tian friction growing out of the damage by the
KuÂ£sian fleet to the North Sea fishing fleet.
This incident, besides ths sentimental effect
ol 'the (ears of resulting hostilities, had a
substantial result in the outpouring hers of
Itstt offerings of stocks for London account.
The weight of the cÂ«Illng was somewhat ag
gravated fcy the inviting level of prices main*
ti.r.c-d A-y ths supporting tactics at the open
lr.g here which offered such a profit on ar
bitrage with the' depressed London pries level
ttat the cable was kept busy with orders to
cell here against purchases in London. It
*Â¦Â¦.-..- accepted as a decisive demonstration >*>f
the strength ol the cpeculative position here
and the powerful interests supporting the mar
feet that the Monday morning movement to
take profits could be deferred .until the sus
taining measures against the foreign depres-
Eton could be made effective. It was on the
reaction from ths rally by supporting orders
that the profit-taking sales were most formld
*.!.Â«; and most urgent, and they proved suffi
ciently heavy to affect the whole market and
to cause rather striking breaches In ths price
level MX different paints. After this movement
the shift of the speculative demand back to
ths Pacifies and the substantial advance of
the gensral level of prices served to confirm
ths speculative confidence in the Inflowing of
the tids of the stocks. That the Anglo- Rus
r u.s. Incident did not break ths demand went
far to reassure speculative sentiment that the
znarket was not yet in that vulnerable posi
tion which inevitably results from ths pro
longed speculation and the resulting Insta
bility leading to a toppling over of values. â¢
7b* dominant influence in the speculation was
the credlf given to stories of sales as a con
seouence cf the Ontario and Wsstern Incident.
The movement In various low-priced railroad
stocks was plainly based on tbs supposition
that the financial' and railroad powers were
committed to a working out of Interchange
cl control and the absorption of minor rail
roads, even act prices already above the mar
ket, at ths Mac considerations that prompted
the Burlington purchase and the L. and H.
settlement. The ol* transcontinental settls
xaent stories wers revived In ths earns oon-
Bsctlon. Given 10 wlds a field for conjecture
and plausible suggestion aad it Is needless to
traverse In detail ths different movements of
the day growing out of tt. Railroad officials
continue optlmisMo over traffics and reports ot
c&r shortage at various points. Ths penlst
cnt heaviness of the United Elsies Bteel issues
on the eve of the quarterly meeting of ths di
rectors and ths action on the dividend gives
fcidlilonal Interest to the ctormy political
outlook abroad; but was emphasised by ths
largs aalss of stocks her* for London account.
Ths market closed Irregular, but animated and
generally, strong.

STOCKSâ Ws " bars another broad, activs
siad strong market. The firta* upon English
vessels by ths Rosslen war fleet occasioned a
::rtl6 hesitation and eotss little scattered Eell
:.%E pressure at ths opening. In the . main.
however. evÂ«ry on* eeeiaed to take the ra
tional vlsw that this was but another unfor
tunate srddent Â¦ and that an apclcjy and
ir^le repsxaiion would follow, dectlon day
St still more than two weeks off. It occa
e'-oos no-asxlety. Polltieal nsws has really
;:u:Â« to do with present valus of stocks. Ws
to not think th&t thÂ« business Improvement or
the advaxi&a In stocks hs,vÂ« yet spent their
f ortss. and, while reactions . with ths present

ilble. ws think they should be taken advan
:tÂ«e of aad stocks kouc&t. The bank state
niect Indicates at least two- thirds of crop
currency movement has been completed.
COTTON â The market was feverish and
somewhat unsettled to-day, but ths undertone
Â»Â«lÂ» niuch stronger than had been anticipated
at ths openlnc In view of ths disturbing; tn
clfient ?a the North Sea aad the favorable
â¢ariy weat&er advices for the greater part of
the oottsn belt, although kllllnj frosts were '
reported s.t Knoxvtlle, Teim., and Atlanta.
Gs. Altho^h it was believed the dainacs from
this would bs very l!*ht. the reports wers rÂ«
vponslble for ths advance In prices in ths
afternoon.- and, while these will havs some
InSueaee. it u doubtful if they will bs suf
ficient to oSsst ths pressure cf the spot in
terests ac-al&at ths market, this pressure hav
!&* for its object the forcing: of a forward
raovemerst and an effort to break ths holdinr
po^cy of ths planters. As there Is practically
bo top crop to be considered, the influence of
frost is correspondingly reduced and continued
wet weather would have a more bullish lnSu
encs. would interters with picking operations

Phelps was wealthy,' stood high in the
community and his arrest was the sen
sation of the day. It< developed that
In 1878 a safe was robbed In Los
Angeles of $10,000 and the police gave
up the effort to find a clew. Stone's
fame had spread, and. he was sent for.
The lock on the safe' had been broken.
The detective spent a day in critical
examination of the lock and from the
dents and scratches he demonstrated
that it had first been opened by some
person who held a key and then
broken for purpose of deception. A
man named Phelps was connected, with
the firm and it was he that discovered
the robbery, notified the police and
later urged that Stone be employed. It
was Phelps that the detective accused
of the robbery and a confession fol
lowed in a. few days.
Captain Appleton W. Stone, noted In
the early days as the most clever de
tective *in the West and a member of
San Francisco's police department for
almost thirty years, passed away early
yesterday morning at his home, 2827
Mission street, from a paralytic stroke
that came some time Wednesday night
and held him speechless aad helpless
till his death. He was in his seventy
seventh year. Four years ago he had
his first touch of paralysis. 5
Few men are more beloved than was
Captain Stone. Though he achieved
fame in running criminals'to death and
his career was devoted to relentless
pursuit of hardened and desperate men,
his gentleness and correctness of habits
were pronounced qualities that were as
'strong the day he was retired on a
captain's pension In 1895, as when he
became a patrolman in 1865.
He served as a detective . for many
years and it was In this capacity that
he won distinction. Many a burglar
and thief who had coverea up his
tracks in a baffling manner owed his
term in prison to t the modest Captain
Stone. In those days Wells-Fargo &
Co. were frequently the victims of
stage robberies in the mountain dis
tricts, and it became a common prac
tice in particularly hard cases for them
to ask the city's Chief of Police to al
low them to employ Detective Stone.
In this manner he became intimately
associated with James B. Hume and
John Thacker. Stone was absolutely
without fear and had many arrests of
robbers to his credit. He. rigorously
adhered to a rule of his own that if
there was only one man to take only
one man should go after him, and he
was singularly successful in his single
handed exploits. .

Further on in his brief Collins de
nounces the Bar Association and char
acterizes It as "pseudo." He attributes
Tobin's position in the matter to the
alleged fact that the latter has fre
quently been defeated by the accused
In fierce forensic battles.
In concluding his answer to the first
charge of moral turpitude in respect to
his deceased wife Collins denounces the
accusation as an attempt to descend
into the grave and summon the dead
to Judgment.
The Supreme Court received the ac
cused's reply but deferred rendering
an opinion until time shall have been
taken to ponder over the biting docu
ment.
There are certainly none bo lusttlting and of
fensive as those who, pretending to be gentle
men, are. lost to all sense of decency and honor
and reeort and have recourse to chaixes that
to all riKht-thJnkihg ' minds can serve only -to
disgrace the accusers. It has been eald tome
Â¦where that "OutÂ«f,thÂ« depths of Infamy com
Â«UÂ» foul vaporing to asperse and defame."
And it is certainly. a mean. envy.- which.; hurt
at the talents or prosperity of others, makes
them the eubject of lta censures, and studies
to dim the. Eplendor of whatever outshines It
self: a dlsculeed hatred which sheds, in its
speeches, the hidden venom of the heart; a
shameful levity, which has no command over
luelf or its words; a deliberate barbarity, that
pierces through the sacred sanctity of the
bom* and with foul insults assails . the good
name of a family. It demands a very low or
der of morals and of Intellect to make and
publish puch outrageous and villainous stuff as
that which comprises the charge In the first
oount of the accusation. No one but an arr&nt
coward would be equaf to the Inherently de
renerate meanness of the act.
Attorney ' George D. Collins filed a
scathing answer yesterday to' the pe
tition that he be disbarred from prac
tice by the Supreme Court. In his
brief he makes serious charges against
Joseph Tobin of the Hibernia Bank
and ridicules the San , Francisco Bar
Association. The document urges that
the accusation against Collins be dis
missed. In answer to the charge that
the accused lawyer disowned his wife
and swore falsely as to. the maternity
of his children Collins says:
A meeting of importance will be
held" In this city In the St. Francis
Hotel on November 4, at which an ef
fort will ; be made to devise a plan to
secure for California more milling
wheat than it Is now producing. Some
time ago the California. State Board
of Trade called a meeting at which
practical, flour millers and others tes
tified that there is not enough gluten
in California wheat to -make the sort
of flour that Is needed /or the export
trade. Since then a great deal of dis
cussion has followed. A committee
appointed by the California State
Board of Trade, including N. P. Chip
man. Professor Shaw, Mr. Hogg of the
Sperry Flour Company, Arthur R.
Briggs.and T. C. Friedlander has met
and taken some testimony and the
State has been generally Interested la
the subject. . -
After consultation it has been deter
mined by those who are concerned In
improving the quality of California
wheat to have a meeting of represent
ative millers, bankers from the inte
rior and others. The Merchants' Ex
change sent out invitations yesterday
by Secretary Friedlander.
The views of the leading men from,
the wheat growing and milling sec
tions of the State will be compared
and some line of action may be agreed
on that will solve the wheat problem
that California has to study. At this
time Kansas wheat, which is much
poorer looking than the California
wheat. Is selling in this State for 47%
cents more per cental than the Cali
fornia product. The quantity of wheat
grown in California has decreased so
that it is necessary to make large an
nual Importations of wheat to meet
the demand for milling and other ttses.

coats of arms and trace my* ancestry
a thousand years." ,
"My dear sir, 300 coats of arms or a
distinct ' lineage extending to the flood
would not condone the blackguardism
of which you stand accused. In this
country a man is less honored for his
ancestry than for his progeny. For
your own sake it is to be regretted that
you cannot appreciate the grossness of
the Insult you addressed to this benchâ
an I Insult which no American gentle
man would utter if he were similarly
placed in a foreign tribunal." 9
"Maybe I did go? a little too far,"
said- Mr. Pilkington. . - : ..
- "You went . a . great deal too . far,"
said the. Judge. "I will sentence you
to-morrow." ./'
Patrolman B. Malone testified that
when Sie arrested Mary Anderson last
Saturday evening at Sixth and Natoma
streets*/ she playfully tapped his head
with one of her shoes, which she had
taken off In order Â¦' to perform with
more light-footed grace a pas seul
which she was doing on â¢ the slde
v.alk for the edification of an admiring
crowd largely -made up r* small boys-
So fond was she of dancw.g, the officer
testified, that she had become [ a pest
to residents of the neighborhood, who
did not desire to see a woman of mid
dle-age and buxom contour cut pigeon
wings and other fancy terpsichorean
figures every time they looked out their
doors or windows.' She will be sen
tenced to-day for disturbing the peace.
Louis Gracce, a one-armed Italian,
laughed heartily when his wife tried
to inform Judge Fritz that she had
been cruelly treated by him. He point
ed to the. stump of his amputated arm
and fairly roared with merriment as
he asked the, Court to look at it and
explain to him -how he could beat an
able-bodied woman like the complain
ant with one hand. He ceased to chor
tle, however, when his Honor remand
ed him till to-day in order to find out
if this cruelty to his wife did not con
sist of failure to support her as well
as disciplining her by physical force.
The Gracces live at 800 Montgomery
street and since he lost his arm while
working in a brickyard the man has
not worked at all. ->
'Bailiff Hickey afterward opined that
It was Miss Holden's eloquence rather
than her magnanimous promise of for
giveness that induced Judge Mogan to
dismiss her.
, Miss Fannie Holden, whose wide
brimmed hat was draped with a brown
automobile veil, wondered what Patrol
man Joy could have been thinking of
when he "pinched" her last Saturday
night at Pacific and Kearny streets
and then charged her with vagrancy.
"As 1 interpret the term," said Miss
Holden to. Judge Mogan, "a vagrant
is a person who can prove no honest
means of Maintenance. If my inter
pretation is correct this policeman has
made a most serious blunder, for hun
dreds of witnesses can prove that I
work in a dance hall and earn as much
money as any girl in the business.
As for my character, the fact that I
never walk home alone, but had a
gentleman piano-player as my escort
when' I was arrested, goes to show that
a mistake has been made. < However,
I am not of a revengeful disposition,
and if this 'charge is dismissed I will
let bygones be bygones and abstain
from getting even with this police
man-" * '..--;
could not tear himself away from the
Market- street phonograph parlor in
which he was arrested, but lingered
there all day and ' far into the â¢ night
absorbing . the ; sweet sounds rolled off
various cylinders. The policeman tes
tified that ere ' Mr. GanglofC acquired
the free music habit he had mastered
the art of procuring free lunch and
was rated an Al bum. Sentence to-day
