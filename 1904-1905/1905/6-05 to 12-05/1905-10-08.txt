V HAD called tipon my friend, Mr. Sher-
I lock Holmes, one day In the autumn
I of last year, and found him in deep
* conversation with a very stout, florld
\ faced, elderly'gcntleman, with fiery red
hair. "With 1 an apology for my intrusion,
I wei about- to withdraw, when Holmea I
piiM mÂ« "abruptly Into thÂ© room and
doied the xloor behind me.
*?Tou could not possibly have come at
time, my dear Watson," he said
Cordially. . .
" "I" was afraid that you were engaged."
'"So I am. Very much Â»Â«Â».â¢*
Thea I?can wait In the next room."
. *iNot at aIL This gentleman. Mr. Wll
â¢on, has been my partner and helper In
many of ray most successful cases, and
I have no doubt that he will be of the ut
most use to me in yours also."
The stout gentleman hair-rose from his
caalr and gave a bob of greeting, with a
quick. Httle, questioning glance from his
Email, fat-encircled eyes. . -
"Try the eettee," said Holmes, relaps
ing. Into his arm-chair - and puttine his
finger-Ups, together, as was his custom
\u25a0when In . judicial moods. "I' know, my
dear Watson, that you share my love of
all': that "is .bizarre and outside the con
ventions and humdrum routine of every-
lifeT/You Ijave shown your relish for
by 'the, enthusiasm which has prompted â¢
chronicle, and. if you will excuse
nay saying so, somewhat to embellish so
many of my own little adventures."
"Your. leases have indeed been of the
greatest â¢ interest to me," I observed.
" Vpu" ' wOl . remember that .1 remarked
the otbfrr -.day, just before we went into
the rvery " simple problem presented â¢by
Miss Sliry. Sutherland, that for Â«trange
effects and extraordinary combinations
we must go to life Itself, which is always
far more daring than any- effort 'of the
Imagination." â¢; j.V- . â¢
"A proposition which I took the liberty
of dbubtinc" â¢- .'Â»,;
"You* did, doctor/ but none the less you

The portly client puffed'- out his chest
\u25a0with an appearance of some little pride,
and pulled a dirty and ' wrinkled news
paper from the Inside pocket of his great
coat. AÂ» be glanced -clown the "advertise
ment column, with his jhead' thrust for
ward, and the paper flattened out upon
his knee; I took a good look at the man,
and â¢ endeavored, after; the fashion of my
companion^ to read the Indications which
xslght be p'resentcd by his dress or ap
pearance- /
I did not gain very much, however, by
SQ7i Inspection.: Our t visitor bore' every
mark of being an average commonplace
British tradesman, obese, pompous, and
clow. He wore rather baggy gray shep
herd's check trousers, a not over-clean
black frock coat, unbuttoned in the front,
and a drab waistcoat with a heavy
brassy Albert chain, and a 6quare pierced
bit of metal dangling down as an orna
xrcst. A frayed top-hat and a -faded
brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet
f collar lay. upon a chair beside him. Alto
rethtr. look as I would, there was noth
-. ing remarkable about the man save his
blaring red head, and the expression of
extreme chagrin and discontent upon his
features!
Sherlock Holmes* quick eye took In my
occupation, and he shook. bis head with a
smile as he noticed my 'questioning
glar.ee*. "Beyond the obvious facts that
he has at some time done manual labor,
that he takes snuff, that he is a Free
mason, that be. has been In * China, and
that he has done a considerable amount
cf trritlns lately, I can deduce, nothing
else."
Mr. Jobcz Wilson, started up in his
chair, with his fore finger upon the pa
per, but his eyes upon my companion. .
"How. in the name of- good fortune, did
you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he ask-.
cd.. "How did you know,- for example,
that I did manual labor. It's as true as
gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."
"'Your hands, my dear sir. Your right
hand is quite a size larger than your left.
You nave- worked with it. and the muscles
are more d-vdoped."
"WÂ«'ll, the enuJT, then, and the Free
masonry?"
"I won't insult jour Intelligence by tell,
ing you how I read that, especially as,
ratiier agajcst'ibe strict rules of your or
der, you use an arc-and-compass breast
pin.*?
\u2666â¢Ah. of course. I forgot thÂ£t. But the

to China. When; in addition, I see a Chi

the matter becomes even more simple."
Mr. Jabcz Wilson laughed heavily.
"Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at
first that you had done something clever,
but I see that there was nothing in It,
after, all.'* -
*T begin to think, Watson," said
Holmes, '.'that I make a mistake In ex
plaining. *Onine ignotum pro magniflco,'
you know, and my poor little reputation,
such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am
bo candid. Can you not find the adver
tisement, Mr. Wilson?" * â¢ \u25a0 .
"Yes, I have got It now," he an
swered., with hiss thick, red ' finger
planted , ; half way -down- the . column.
"Here it is. This is what began It. alL
You just read it for yourself, sir.*'.
I took the paper from him and read
as follows:: \u25a0 ' â¢:.."\u25a0\u25a0 1 ..
"To the Red-Headed League: On

"What on earth _doesi this mean?"
I ejaculated, after I -had twice read
over the extraordinary announcement.
Holmes chuckledand wriggled In his
chair, as was his habit when in high
spirits. "It is a little off the beaten
track, isn't it?" sald t he.i:,"And : now.
Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and

"Very good.' If ow, Mr. Wilson?" .
"Well.^it is just as I have been tell

Jabez -Wilson, mopping his forehead;

could to cheer me up," but by bedtime. I
had reasoned myself out of the^whole
trims.' However, in the morning I deter-
to have alook at -it ajiyhow, so I
bought a penny bottle of Ink. and with a
quill pen and seven sheets of foolscap pa
per 1 started off for Pope's Court.
"Weil, to my surprise and delight,
everything was as right as possible. The
table was set out reudy for me, and Mr.
Duncan Ross was there to see that I got
iairly to work. He started me off upon
the letter A. and then he left me, but
would drop in from time to time to see
that ell was 1 right with me. At twÂ«
o'clock he bade me good-day, compliment
ed me upon the amount that I had writ
ten, and locked the door of the office after
me.
"Thi* went oi: day after day. Mr.
Holn.es, and on Saturday the . manager
came in and planked down four golden
toyereigns for my week's work.. It was
the same the next week, and the same the
week after. Every morning I was there at
ten and every afternoon I left at two. By
deg:ee:B Mr. Duncan Itoss took to coming
in enly once of a morning, and then, after
a time, he did not come in at aIL Still,
of course, 1 never dared to leave the room
for an instant, for I was not sure when
he might come, and the billet was fiuch a
good one, and suited me so wejl, that I
would not risk the loss of it.
"Eight weeks passed afcay like this,
and 1 had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armor and Architecture and
Attica, and hoped with diligence that I
might get on to the B's before very long.
It cost me something in foolscap, and I
had pietty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole
business came to an end."
"To an end?"
"Yes. sir. And no later than this
morning:. I went to my work ns usual
at 10 o'clock, but the door was shut
and locked, with a little square of card
board hammered on the . middle of
the panel with a tack. Here It is, and
you can read for yourself."
He held up a piece of white card
board about the size of a sheet of note
paper. It read in this fashion:
"THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
IS
DISSOLVED.
October 9, 1890."
Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this
curt announcement and the rueful face
behind it, until the comical side of the
affair was so completely overtopped
every other consideration that we both
burst into a roar of laughter. : :v: v
"I cannot see that there Is anything
very funny," cried our client, fiushing
up to the roots of his naming head. "If
you can do nothing better than laugh
at me, I can go elsewhere." i
"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him
back into the chair, from which he had
half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your
case for the worjd. It is most refresh
ingly unusual. But there is, if you will
excuse my saying bo, something just
a little funny about It. Pray what
steps did you take when you found the
card upon the door?"
"I was staggered, Blr. I did not know
what to do. Then I called at the of
fices round, but none of them seemed to
know anything about it. Finally I
went to the landlord, who is an ac
countant, living on the ground floor,
and I asked him if he could tell me
what had become of the Red-headed
League. He said that he had never
heard of any such body. Then I asked
him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He
Answered that- the name was new to
him. " -
" â¢Well,* said I, 'the gentleman at
No. 4.'
"'What, the red-headed man?'
" â¢Yes.'
. "'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William
Morris. He was & solicitor, and was
using my room as a temporary con
venience until his new premises were
ready. He moved out yesterday.'
" 'Where could I find him?*
" *Oh, at his new ofÃces. He did tell
me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward
street, near St. Paul's.'
Â»'I started off. Mr. Holmes, but when
I got to that address it was a manu
factory of artificial knee-caps, and no
one" In it had ever heard of either Hr..
William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
"And what did you do then?" asked
Holmes.
"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
and I took the advice of my assistant.
But he could not help me in any way.
He could only say that if I waited 1
should hear by post. But that was
not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes.
I did not wish to lose such ' a place
'without a struggle, so, as I had heard
that you were good enough tc give
advice to poor folk who -were in need
of it, I came right away to you."
"And you did very wisely," said
Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy
to look into it. From what you have
told me I think. that it is possible that
graver Issues hang upon It than might
at firKt eight appear. *
"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wil
son. "Why, I have lost four pound a
week."
"Ajs far as you are personally con
cerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not
see that you have any grievance
against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand,
richer by some Â£30, to say nothing. of
the minute knowledge which you have
gained on every subject which comes
under the letter A. You have lost
nothing by them."

Holmes sat up in his chair inconside
rable excitement. "I thought as "much,"
be said. "Have you ever observed ; that
his ears are pierced for earrings?"- i
"Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy
had done it for him when he was a lad.'.'
"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in
deep thought. "He is still with you?"~
"Oh yes, sir; I- have just left him.",.
"And has your business been attended
to in your absence?"
"Nothing Â«to complain of, sir.. There's
never very, much to do of a mornlrrg-."
"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be
happy to give you an opinion, upon, the
subject in the course of a day or two.
To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by
Monday we 1 may come to a conclusion."
i "Well, Watson," said Holmes, when our
visitor had left us, "what do you make of
it all?"
"I make nothing of it," I answered
frankly. "It is a most mysterious busi
ness."
"Afi a rule," said Holmes, "the more bl
sarre a, thing is the less mysterious it
proves to be. It is your commonplace,
featureless crimes which are really puz
zling, just as a commonplace face is the
most difficult to Identify. But I must be
prompt over this matter."
"What are you going to "do. then?" I
asked. x : '
"To smoke," he answered. "It Is quite
a three-pipe problem, and I beg that you
won't speak to -me for fifty minutes."
He curled himself Up in his chair, with
his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like
nose, and there he eat with -his eyes
closed and his black clay pipe thrusting
out like the bill of some strange bird. I
had come to the conclusion that he had
dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding
myself, when he suddenly sprang out at
his chair with the gesture of, a. man; who
has made up his mind, arid ;i)ut his pipe
down upon the mantelpiece. VÂ» .'â
"Sarasate plays at St. James Hall

you think. Watson?/ Could'your patients
spare you for a few. hours?" A \u25a0,
"I have nothing to do to-day. Myvprac

"Then put on. your hat - :and
come. -I am going through the city first,
and we can have some lunch" on the. way.
I observe: that~ there is a good , deal of
German music on the programme, which
Is rather more to my. taste than Italian
or French. It is iritrospective, atid I want
to introspect. "Come along!" \~. ::\u25a0-'\u25a0.

Three gilt balls and a^brpwn board
with "Jabez Wilson" v in 'white letters
upon a corner house'/anno'unced : ; the
place where our red-headed client' car-,
ried on his business. Sherlock Holmes
stopped In front of it with his head on
one side and looked It all over with
his eyes shining brightly between
puckered lips. Then he walked slow
ly up the street and then down again
to the corner, still looking keenly at
the houses. Finally he returned to the
pawnbroker's and, having thumped
vigorously upon the pavement with his
stick two or three times,' he went up
to the door and knocked. . It was in
stantly opened by a bright-looking,
clean-shaven young fellow, who asked'
him to step in.
"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only
wished to aek you how you would go
from here to the Strand."
"Third right, fourth left," answered
the assistant promptly, ' closing the
door.
"Smart \u25a0 fellow, ; that," observed
Holmes, as we walked away. "He is,
in my .judgment, the fourth smartest
man In London, and for. daring I am
not sure that he has not a claim to be
third. J have known something of
him before." y" -~*.',: . .
"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's a3
sistanf'counts for a good deal in this

am sure that you inquired' your way

1 My friend was an enthusiastic musician,
being himself .not only i a : very capable
performer, but a; composer of no ordinary
merit. AHthe afternoon , he sat : in :: the
stalls wrapped in the most perfect happi
ness, gently waving his long, thin fingers
in j time to : the music,.' while! his gently
smiling face and his languid, -; drearby
eyes were as unlike those of Holmes, the
sleuth-hound,' Holmes the relentless, keen
witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as
It was possible to conceive. lln his singu
lar character the ; dual nature alternately
asserted itself, and his extreme exactness
and astuteness ' represented, as I have
often thought, the reaction against the
poetic and contemplative mood which oc
casionally predominated /in him. The
swing of his nature took him from ex
treme languor to devouring energy." and,
a3 I knew well, he was never so truly for
midable as when, for : days lon end,* he
had been lounging in his armchair amid
his Improvisations and his \ black-letter
editions. Then It .was that the lust of the'
chase would suddenly come upon him and
that his brilliant reasoning power would
rise to the level of Intuition f until those,
who were unacquainted with his!: methods
would look askance, at him as on. 1 a' man
whose knowledge! was not 'that,' of. other

where were we going, and what were we
to do? I had the hint from Holmes that
this smooth-faced pawnbroker's â¢ assist

might play a deep game. I tried to puz

set the matter aside until night should

standing at - the - door, : andj as I entered

from above. .On' entering his room I
found . Holmes tin animated conversation
with two men, one of- whom I recognized
as Peter Jones, the ' official police agent, -
while the other \ was a . long, thin, sad
. fa,ced man, with \u25a0' a ;, very shiny hat and
oppressively respectable frock-coat.
"Ha! our party is: complete,'.' said

taking his , heavy ' hunting crop from the
rack. ..."Watson, I think you know Mr.

"That is better," said John Clay, Se
renely. - He made a sweeping bow to the
three of us, and walked quietly off in the
custody of the detective.
"Really. Mr. Holmes," said Mr. - Merry
weather, as we followed them from the
cellar, "I do not know how the .bank can
thank you or repay you. '- There is no
doubt that you have detected and de
feated in the most complete manner one
of the most determined attempts at bank
robbery that has ever come within my
experience."
"I have had one or two little scores
of my own to settle with. Mr. John
Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at
some small .expense over this matter,
which I shall expect the b,ank to re
fund, but beyond that I am amply re
paid by having had an experience which
is in many ways unique and by hear-*'
ing the very remarkable narrative of
the Red-headed League."
"You see, "Watson," he explained, to
the early hours of the morning, as we
. sat over a glass of whisky -and soda in
Baker street, "it was perfectly obvious
from the first that the only possible ob
. Ject of this rather fantastic business of
-the advertisement of the leagua and
the copying of the 'Encyclopedia' must
-ibe* to -get this not over-bright pawn
, broker out of the way for a number
qf", hours every day. It was a curious
way of managing It, but really it would
\u25a0~ba difficult â¢to suggest a better. Tha
method . was , no doubt suggested to
: Clay's ingenious mind by the color of
his accomplice's hair. * The Â£4 a week
\vrzss&: lure^whlch must draw him. and
" what was- It to them, who were playing
; for thousands? They put in "the ad-
one rogue has thÂ«-tem
porary office.'- the other rogue Incites tho
man to apply, for it, and together they
manage; to secure his absence every
mornins In the week. From the time
I heard of. the assistant, having: come
for half wages, It was obvious to me
that he had some strong motive for se
curing the situation." . â¢
V VBut how; could you guess what the
;mottye -waaT", *
â¢- "Had there been women in the house.
I should have suspected a mere vulgar
. intrigue. That, however, was out of
the, Question.: The man's business was
a* small .one and there was nothing in
.his* house which could account for such
elaborate preparations and such an ex
penditure as they were at. It must,
: thenj.be something out of the house.
"What could , It be? I thought of the
â¢ fondness for photography
. and hlsr trick of vanishing Into the cel

of Â» this tangled cue. .Then I made in

thing' in the cellar â something which
â¢took. many hours a day for month 3 on
end. i Â»Â« hat could it.be. once more? I
could'think of nothing save that he was
'rvnning a tunnel to some other bulld
â¢lngr.; _
"So far I had got < when we. went, to
visit the scene of action. . I surprised you
by .beating upon the .pavement with ; my.
â¢tick. I was ascertaining whether the
cellar stretched out in front or behind. â¢It
was not in front. , -Then I rang the belT,
and, as I hopÂ«d, the ' assistant answ vied \u25a0
It. We have had soma skirmishes, .dux ;
we had never sÂ«t eyes upon each other
before.' I hardly looked at his face. His
knees were what I wished to see. You
must youiself have remarked how worn,
wrinkled and stained they were. They
spoke of those. hours of burrowing. The
only reraalnlng point was what they were
burrowing for. I walked round the cor
ner, sa-ftr that the City and Suburban
Bank abutted on our friend's premises,
and felt, that I had solved my problem.
When you drove. home after the concert
I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the
chairman of the bank directors, with the
result that you have seen." ,
"And how could you tell that they
would make their attempt to-night?" I
asked.
when they closed â¢ their league
offices that was a sign that thÂ«jr cared no .
longer about- Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence
âIn other words, that they had completed
their tunnel. But it was essential that
they should use It soon, as it might be
discovered, or the bullion might be re
moved:- Saturday would suit them better
than any other day, as it would give them
two days for their escape. For all these
reasons I expected them to come to
night." - . â¢ â¢ .\u25a0 ~

T UTHER BURBANK Is paying the
I * penalty of being a great man.
17 He is learning that his littlest
*"T : word may be inflated and de
tached until it become 3 as alarming and
unmanageable as a runaway balloon.
He is discovering that his sanest and
most carefully framed thought may re
turn to him distorted beyond the weirdest
disproportions of a nightmare.
Not long ago, in the goodness of his
heart, he accorded a five minutes' in
terview to a St. Louis clergyman, and,
their talk turned on child culture, a
question to which Mr. Burbank. being
above all a humanitarian, has given deep
and earnest thought.
Mr. Burbank expressed his views to
the clergyman.
The clergyman In turn repeated them>to
an Interviewer as accurately as his mem
ory and understanding made It possible.
The Interviewer, through the crucible
of his mind, gave them to the public. -
The public fell upon them tooth and
flf-n. each person looting such a frag
ment of thought as came within bis men
tal grasp.-
And the result-
Well, we know the story of "The Three
Black Crows."
y>. Burbank r^TnÂ«Â»if gays that "Be
ff ntt cf that five minutes' Interview 1
have beea plunged Into the arena of
fM^ culture and fastastlo words have
been put In my mouth which were never
tittered."
In sheer sell-defense Luther Burbank
raa<3Â» child culture the subject of his
g;Â»ech at the complimentary dinner given
to him by the California. State Board of
Tn&m several weeks ago.
Ho was at great pains to define his
theories accurately. He reduced his
thought to terms of extremest lucidity.
Ke epoke words so sane and simple and
Impressive that It seemed the veriest
child must understand them, and the
most biased of minds must recognize
them as statements of universal truths.
His sj>eech was printed verbatim in
The CalL - â¢
It was scattered broadcast, as far as
telegraph and cable and printed page can
reach.
And Luther Burbank was at peace. He
felt that he had put himself on record
without ambiguity or equivocation, and
iliere was an end of it. He could now
go on with the work in hand, giving -his
attention to the development of his more
ihan two thousand exDeriments .with
plant life, and putting more under way.
But Luther Burbank reckoned without
his public
It fell uj>on his speech with the avidity
of the seven-year locusts upon a Nebras
ka corn croj>.
The views he had expressed with so
much lucidity and moderation and tolera
tion were torn sentence from sentence
and word from word; and from the nias
sacre and mutilation there has arisen, a
storm of protect from the bigoted, the
biased and the mental's* oblique, a whirl
wind -el misinterpretation from the fool
ish.
Letters have poured in upon Mr. Bur-
bank and upon The Call, which . was the \u25a0
first paper to publish his speech, applaud
ing and attacking his views from every
angle except Mr. Burbank's.
Because of them, I reaped the pleasure
of one more pilgrimage to the vine
draped modest white cottage of the Sage
of Santa Rosa, not to ask him wha.fhÂ«,
did say. but to ask him what he had to
say to the strange things the public as
sumed he had said.
There was no impatience, no want of
tolerance in his attitude to the heed
less, headlong public that has read
new, strange meanings into his clear
end simple utterances.
"I am glad," he said to me, "that the
question has aroused discussion, even
uicngh soja*' of \u2666**â¢Â» things said in the
discussion are foolish. Discussion will
at least create an interest and it is a
good thing that attention should be

Such words coming from no less a person than
Luther Burbank carry their own authority."
As scientist, thinker and humanitarian he commands. our
respect. If Mr. Burbank could impress this thought , upon

his own dogmatism is right and every

"The ideal environment for child life

kindness and simplicity would pre
dominate, and a mode of education that
would tend to develop instead of sup
press and eliminate the Individuality.'.
'"I think our children. are kept In
school too long., taught too many
things â¢ and too many of them taught
the same things. lam not saying that
our public school system 13 not the
best in the world. I think that it is
as good a thing of its kind as there is.
but that is not saying -that It is the
best way of educating', children. I
think that, of necessity, it* takes the
chlld'3 individuality too little Into ac
count. There is too much crushing out
of the inherent differences, of what Dr.
David Starr Jordan calls the Initiative
that special individuality; which LÂ»
the most valuable of all endowments,
the very quality on which progress de
pends.' '
"In our system of education our chil
dren are. all filled up with, the 'same

tion or Information â like bo " many : lit

much Is lost to us by this process.
"The most valuable thing in. the pro

makes them great, and that they have
preserved in spite of the leveling aim
of education." .
DR. W. A. MEIERDIERKSINTRODUCING
THACHER
(Copyright by the S. S. McClure Com
pany.)
TEN years ago the rush was a
thing to be remembered. Tou
were herded by tbe seniors with
a lot of other fellows who had
just arrived in New Haven, and
marched like sheep at night to the
Hopkins Grammar School lot, where
you saw another crowd of men with
torches. These you were told were
the sophomores, whom you were to
punish. A low rail fence separated the
lot from High street; this you "took"
and hung "on to. If, with 300 of your
fellows, you got through the evening
without dislocating at least one bone,
you CM not think that you had en
joyed tbe occasion.
But the faculty stopped all that halt
a dozen years ago, and the rush to-day
la much less barbarous than It used to
be. But then it is less interesting.
Most of the freshmen who come -to
Yale, and there are several hundreds
of them, arrive in town at least three
days before college opens. This gives
them a chance to become acquainted
with one another and to learn early
In the term come of the things that It
might be Inconvenient to have to learn
later. There Is, for Instance, an In
nocent-looking fence running around
the north end of the campus, with a
firm round rail on top, and Initials cut
in big jagged marks all over it. It Is
wisest to acquaint one's self as early
as possible with the fact that this is
not freshman property. There are
other things also that one learns soon
er or later In the course of the first
month at Yale, which It would be use
less to narrate here, as advice is al
ways superfluous.
Thacher, "Nineteen Hundred and â -,"
â¢was a big icllow, with an intelligent face,
as pounds of well-distributed weight, and
a smile. When he came to New Haven
from some out-of-the-way town In Ohio
the first thing that he did was to find an
eating place, where he struck a bargain
with an astonished landlady for roast
betf three times a day and a quart and
a half of milk for supper. Then he took
three final exams, and pushed Greek his
tory so hard that he had to tell some
body about It. ' As he knew no one, â¢he
told It to the first men he met. These
happened to be Atkinson and Phlllipi,
who cane from St. James together, and
regarded themselves as "thejeading ele
ment In the class." They looked on
Thacher with high-bred suspicion. They
thought him "fresh." They also made
â¢him feel these things when they left him.
They were good fellows in their way. but
ell suj>erlor beings are heartless, and the
impression they left on Thacher produced
'a lonesomeness that cut like a pain.
Most men who come to a big college
from a small town have this to meet as
the first of thfir freshman trials. Thacher
wanted to be V "cdâ he had a capacity, for
itâ and he Join himself that if. he .could
do something that was worth doing lie
might make the acquaintance of these
men and be introduced In the class. He
envied the fellows he saw walking arms-,
over-shoulders along the campus. Then
he met Elkins, a small person with a
turned-up nose, whom he had eeen in
Greek history, and in a feeling of friend
liness that all these things had brought
out, asked him to sit on the Fence. El
kins came from a big preparatory school,
and knew Atkinson and Phillips and a lot
of other 'men, but he was little, and ad
mired bigness; he liked the clear, pleas
cm eyes and firm mouth of the West
erner, and rather understood, in a. way,
how he felt. :/.'.- \u25a0:\u25a0'. V
There were groups of men with pipes
in their mouths and eyeglasses on their
iioses on the Senior Fence, and more men
with e'&ss numerals on their caps on the
Junior Fence, and a crowd of fellows on
Durfee steps, while a noisy, surging mob
of freshmen blocked the entrance to
Alumni Hall, where examinations were
grinj on. Somebody on the Junior' Fence
saw the two freshmen and grinned.
Somebody on Durfte steps also saw. them
and whisDcred to the cjowd.
â¢ Then something happened. A knot of
eight or ten sophomores, led by a broad
ehouldered. siur.re-jawed man with let
ters on his cap, walked over to the
Sophomore Fence and took little Elkins
suddenly by the coliar. arms and legs and
.precipitated him into the roadway.
Thacher followed, though it took more
ir.en to do It. He landed hard, lost hat
and tore his coat sleeve. When Elkins.
bruised and frightened, started to rise
the big sophomore caught him by the
shoulder and threw him down again,
which was unnecessary. Indignation and
rage surged up Into Thacher's throat.- He
jumped to his feet, tackled the big sopho^
more and sat down on him. Instantly
there was an uprcar that brought heads
to windows all along Durfee and as far
tfs Lawrance, and scores of men running
from every direction.
"Sat on Da-o. did he?" the men were
shouting; to each other. "That's the fresh
est thine I ever heard of!"
It was fresh, no mistake about it. Dale
was a varsity guard. Dale twisted and
turned and swore- and jabbed his elbows
Into Thaeher's tide, but the freshman sat
on, and incidentally rubbed Dale's head
Into the pround to emphasize things.
Somebody yelled "Kill the freshman!"
and a rush started in upon the two men.
Then a.raedium-slzed senior shoved his
way quietly into the crowd, took Th'acber
by the collar and yanked him to his feet.
. "Now, go and get jour dinner, fresh
. man," he said.
Th?.cher obeyed, swallowing some
thing that rose ir>. his throat and nearly
Jilled his e>Â«;s with tears. He felt dis
graced for life. Ke didn't answer the
hundred excited classmates who
thronged around him. inquiring what
the row was alKjut. It was Just his
luck to start his college course like
that. Even when Elkins asked him
timidly whether he was hurt he didn't
answer. â¢
It it wasn't the freshest thing in six
freshman classes there was no record
of anything fresher. That was the opin
ion aj! over college, and it produced a
ehort. o pithy editorial ia the Daily News
mat lett no doubt as to the traditions
cf the Fence. ' Somebody, howe\ r er,
heard that Dale, who was a bully,
though a corking guard, had said some
thing to the freshman that no man with
re! f -respect will stand, and when that
got ahrozd the fellows understood It;
nr.d the football captain said something
to Dale that made the Individual mad
dor than ever, and that put an idea into
hi? head. But of that presently." '
Thacher and Elkinsand Atkinson and
SOD other freshmen shouted "Yea-a-a!
Nineteen hundred and - â ! Yca-a-a!"
without knowing what they were shouting
for. except that the strange, mew, thrill
ing, intoxicating "Nineteen. hundred and
!*' was their own class name, and was
to be yelled and Ehouted "Yea-a-a!" to
the end of life. That is -class spirit
Down York street came . the avalanche
of men, and it now apptared that there
Ewin Oviatt
was. a band ahead, playing .''Boola,"
though the only sign of this waa the flash
of the. electric light or of the torches. on
an upraised trombone, or the occasional
shrill note of the cornet, above' the sink
ing, sweeplngroar of the crowd. -.''""
"Yea-a-a! 'Freshmen!":: Some onÂ« In the
van Â«f~ the procession tav ths new, re
cruits. "Fall In, Freshmenl" . The 600
torch bearers swung by, singing with the
band, each man waving his flaming stick,
each man with v his coat inside out and
hatless. Thacher shouldered his way Into
the mob and was hustled by a senior to a
place in the front rank of the freshmen
class, where he grabbed an arm on either
side of him and fell into step. ;
"Yea-a-a I" This waa great.
"Yea-a-a 1 Nineteen hundred and â -I"
It rolled up York street like a tidal wave.
Away ahead of him flamed the torches,
ahead and behind him were countless un
dergraduates locking step and executing
that singular curb-to-curt two-step that
is a peculiarity of Yale processions. Peo
ple were sticking their heads out of win- .
dows: flags were being waved by young
ladles from front doorsteps; old gradu
ates mounted fences and smiled indulg
ently. - '\u25a0*\u25a0';:' ;\u25a0\u25a0 '.^ â¢--.-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢ ; ->i-'.- - Â»
Some one was making, a speech from Â§
the steps of Osborn Hall. The band was "
Quiet and a muffled "Bh-sh!" went
through the crowd. Nobody heard what
the orator was eaying, but somebody who
knew things told a man next to Thacher .
that it was the football captain. Then
everybody tiptoed and had to be lifted up
to see the face of the greatest man at
Yale. He was a medium-sized fellow,
with an athletic build and a business-like
face, and he was saying things. \u25a0 All that
Thacher . heard was that the freshmen
ought to behave themselves and uphold
the honor of their class, which seemed
paradoxical. Then the men in frontâ they
were seniorsâ laughed and yelled. "Good â¢
speech! Bravo I" and the men in the back
âthey were freshmenâ yelled "Yea-a-a!"
That, was all they knew how to yell.
Then the band played, torches flared
again, long columns of bare-headed danc
ing men with red fire and romari candles
untwined like the lengths of a phospho
rescent serpent, and in an incredibly
Bhort time Thacher found himself in the
outer ring of a dense crowd of men on the'
grammar school lot. In the middle of
this a number of well-dressed chaps with
"Y'6" on their sweaters or mysterious
gold pins on their vests were pushing the
crowd back with \u25a0 their : torches until the
front rank sat down on' the grass In a cir
cle and lit their pipes, and the rest of the
men piled in in rings at their backs. Then
the band struck up and the captains of |
the university teams started the perform
ance by calling out ' for' thÂ« first candi
dates.
"Lightweight championship!". , !
A long young man with -a-' cane* got' up
from the ground and led the" sophomores
in a class cheer. He was jeered and ap- ' .:
plauded and sat down agamJ : ; '. â¢ 'â¢"'\u25a0 ;';'
"Â£hake 'em up, freshmen!" yelled some-,
body. ; â¢; _V^~. '\u25a0 , '*\u25a0'.'â¢ V- . '\u25a0\u25a0/\u25a0'\u25a0:''\u25a0
"Long: - cheer - for - nlneteen-hundred

nel suit. "He was a: senior and waved a
bulldog ; pip?.. ."â¢' "'The Brek-ek-ek'-ek!".Vi
. was los*t,^ because-the freshmen* djan't,"
know it, but they came 'in .strong, on ' :
the "Whooxup! Wnoorup" Hollabaloo:
Yule! Yale! Yale! Rah! Rah! Rah! Nine
teen hundred and !" and received long
applause.
Suddenly a small, wiry fellow,, amid
a roar of approval from the upper class
men, sprang into the arena from the
sophomore side and was stripped to the
waist by his friends. It was Kellogg,
the varsity cockswain. He weighed
ninety-six pounds.
"Freshman!" yelled somebody. At these
events your class docs not decide
beforehand who is to go in, so long
waits result.
Then there was a commotion in tho
freshman ranks and presently a stubby
youth with short legs and turned-up
nose was projected feet foremost into
the ring:, where he picked hhnself up,
expostulating. Somebody pulled off his
coat and necktie and in a minute he
was being rubbed down by a senior. "
"Who it is? Eh? Elkins? Yea-a-a!
Elkins!" This was from the freshmen
who knew him. and Thacher felt his
heart pound as he saw his new ac
quaintance out therA in the flaring light"
of the torches. Everybody closed in
and bent over everybody else's back/
and. the band plaj-ed, and the coacher^
put the two llttlfi men out into the ring
and said. "Go ;ihÂ«ad ard win." It was '
a great 'experience for the freshman
class. An hour before and they had
been a heterogeneous mass. of 355 indi
viduals.- Now they had in an instant
become a compact, sjnsrle-hearted.body
â a class. This is why the Tush in a
good thing.' Thacher dimly compre
hended this as he looked out into the
arena and saw that pink-skinned littla â¢
fellow with curly hair and a grim look
.on -his chubby face, on whom the hopes
of a new Yale class centered.
With the signal a great hush fell on the
crowd, and then a sudden, knife-like -
cheer went up from tbe sophomores. ' A *
hajf-dozen seniors darted forward on
their knees and then rose to their feet,. ,
knocklqg" the. ashes from their pipes.
"First "throw for sophomore." said the
referee. ' â¢
A stinging yell went up from the sopho
more, ranks. Around Thacner' the rllence
could be felt
A sain the men went from* their corners
and in two minutes the upper classman
lay panting on his back, with the; little'
freshman' hugging: him tight about, the.
waist. -._..,.
"Freshman! Yea-a-a! Elkins!"
Over the dense mass of.. men stretched
across the street to the fence in front of
the monument yard rang a long, clear
cheÂ«r with the freshman's name .at , the
end of It. Over in one corner the little
freshman sat panting on the knee of a
tall senior, who was potting him on the.
choulder, while another seniorâ Joy' of
joysâ a football man, was dragging a
rough towel down his Thacher. el-,
bowed through and said. "Elkins, you .win
that next throw!" That was. rather fresh,
for Thacher, and a junior pushed, him
back and told him to" dry up. and not
make, the freshman nervous.., Elklna
smiled at all. this. He felt shaky In; the
knees.. Out there in the flaring torchlight
the sophomore. was already taking his po
sition..
"Great! .You've got him; Elkins! ' Jab 1 :
his knee! Bock him! Shove!"
"Freshman wins the throw and bout,"
said "the referee.
Above the blaring band could' be heard'
the. great, tumult of ' cheers \u25a0- from \ the '.
freshman class, that had just; discovered
themselves to be â¢ something. It was
enough for Thacher 'to know that-some^.
thing had happened for his - class to J be
proud of. It went over him like intoxica
tion. : - 'â¢\u25a0 â¢'";\u25a0. \u25a0 , \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ â¢ \u25a0 ;::v,:;v'

It took ten minutes; for the freshman"
class to find their man" and ten minutes
more for the sophomores. 'Some day
they will cut all ft}is outand have a.
progrramme.* Then Athertou,Â»with
possession writteh.all over his i aristo-c

3.v A wild > yell of triumph â¢ rang I from the
sophomore ranks, while the freshmen
, groaned^'and 'were silent. "A fellow* ln a
Â»- sweater â¢ pulled "Chacher, to - his ~ feet 5 and
hustled him to* the side lines, where he^ was
"rubbed vigorously and tied up . in a blan-"
"ket. -.Thaqher : felt ; dizzy. Samebody
sponged off his, face and neck. : and the
coach* told T hlm some excellent things in
short, snappy sentences that stuck In his
brain; . Around him. .crowded -his â¢class
mates, patting him on "the' back, "encour
aging him. Little Elkins, and' this was
what Thacher remembered, put his stub
nose close to Thachtr's and told him to
go in and win. The Implerlng eyes of the
little fellow haunted Thacher. He could
still see ; that white face in the dust by
the sophomore fence, with a big brute of
a sophomore swearing at him. This clear
ed his brain again and set his veins ting
ling-
"How many^falls do I have?" Thacher
asked the referee.
"Two out of three," sad the senior.
"Then I'll do ' himâ threeâ times," said
Thacher. slowly. The senior smiled from
his. elevated position In life, and twice
glanced curiously at the ' firm,. haru mouth
of the freshman. Even when he stepped
into the ring he turned and looked at him
again. "He'll do," he said to himself, and
made a mental memorandum.
When Thacher threw off bis: blanket
and trotted out. lnto the ring again he
knew what he was going to do. He
met -Dale's eyes fearlessly, searchlngly.
He. wanted a fair fight. If he had that
he felt he* could win. Tbere was a
red spot in thecorner of Dale's eye
that his 'coach. \u25a0â¢ had told him to look
out for. There was a lazy sneer on
Dale's face, -too, that made his gorge
rise. A sense of tingling shame swept
over him: at the fellow's bullying. He
took his measure as the sophomore
crouched before him,' big, handsome,
statuesque,. with broad, stooping shoul
ders that Thacher admired. - A minute
of. cautious study on both sides and
the crowd leaned forward .breathlessly
as the two big men clinched. Then,
like a flash. Thacher took the aggres
sive so suddenly .that before' Dale had
time 'to" know what, had happened he
was flat on his back," wjth a wild, thrill
ing yell' of 300 freshmen singing In hfs
ears. It was a simple trick that he had
succumbed to. He knew that a mo-,
ment later when he tried to roll over
andVsret to h!3 feet. *
"";- "Fair throw !'*-\u25a0 yelled the referee and 5
the timekeepers snapped ; their , watche3'
and threw up their,: hands In delight.
It had taken just -twenty seconds. A
â¢shout went up from- the. freshmen .that
could have been heard ten, blocks and
men rushed to where Thacher sat, sur- r
prised -'and panting, Iwlth the football
; captain rubbing his , . arms. Thacher
I wondered if they would* be making that
fuss again jover him five minutes later.
"Over 'there in. a corner- 'sat. a very
angry-looking ' sopuomore with big.
/bare shoulders.-. who was .waving his.
i rubbers awayÂ«and. glaring at him. But
Thacher -grinned amiably when Elkins

Thacher felt himself suffocated In .the
sophomore's grasp, with his hot breath*
on his cheek. Referees ware crowding
In. holding their- torches above thalr
heads. Above all he heard his dear class J
shouting: \ "^
"Finish him! Finish : him! : Ob, pleaje-*
win that throw!" , . .... .. ,
. It shot through his blood, like elea-,
tricity. The man at his side gave one
sudden, violent Jerk, but Thacher,"'roll
ing over with every muscle tense.
Jammed his arms straight out on the
grass. He heard his class roar, asd It
sounded like a thunderclap. The man "
under him was twisting over again. He
jammed hi? arms out harder, till Dale's
shoulders were flat on the sod. Â« The ,
referee ran up with his whistle between.,
his lips. " T~.
Then Thacher noticed something. The
arm that he was shoving: down so mer
cilessly- lay limp and pathetic In his *
grasp, though with the other Dale was
try tog hard to - rise. A hot . sense ot
brutal. pitiless triumph filled Thacher's -
brain like a flood tide. He was on the
verge of the first great victory of his
life. In a moment he would be the herb
of his class, and perhaps what he had
. so 'longed - for would be brought aad
laid at his ' feet. One more * Jerk and -
jam and that limp figure would lie out
stretched like a felled oak. But just as
the referee leaned over them Thacher
sprang back, his lips pale, but his brarri
steady. , -"'" = â¢" ; v -" ' ~ sv -"

I AWAKE with a start on this days
of days wondering what delightful
thing Is to happen. Then \u25a0with a
rush I remember: I am to visit the
wonderful Emma Eames.
I have been looking forward to it with
all impatience. Now it has come and I
un almost afraid.
I recall the experience of a friend of
mine with a rising young ; author a few
years ago. She was in school in Wash
ington and was often entertained at the
White House. On' one occasion she met
this young man and immediately she
said, "Oh, Mr. Davis. I am so delighted
to meet you, and I want to ask at once
about the Princess. I'm hanging breath-
Attsou her fate. How DOES it come
Of course it was crude, but she was
very young and very sincere indeed in her
Interest. Imagine her feelings when the
hero turned and walked away without a
word! She dropped In a little shivering
neap on a convenient couch and there she
stayed till some friend brought her a cup
"of tea and helped her pull herself to
gether. She said afterward that she
hoped she might never again meet a ce
lebrityâlncipient or full blownâ and her
family agreed that her gifts did not ap
pear to lie in that direction.
I am not sure this recollection is irrel
evant, for it has to do with my uncer
tainty as to how I shall acquit myself
to-day.
Perhaps I should be wiser to keep to
my present acquaintance with my god
cess of the golden voice, an across-the
footlights acquaintance that has brought
me joy for several seasons. By its terms
1 have known her In the trailing robes
of Juliette, or the simple grown of Mar
guerite, dark-skinned as Aida, or fair
and white as the young bride. Elsa, and
always and always has she given most
freely < l her art and charm and pcrson
fti.iy.
â¢ *c. her friends on the other side of the
footlights, have repaid her with sympa
thy and appreciation and affectipnâ meat
and drink to the singerâ but we cannot
give as much as we take, and so when
spring comes, when the canvas towers
and minarets are folded away, Emma
Eimes, tired with - labors, hastens to
her Italian home, where she becomes Mrs.
Julian Story. Interested in housewifely
â¢ duties and concerned only in the mat
ters of their estate.
It is pleasant to remember that while
Madame Eames is adding to her tri
umphs with her glorious voice, Julian
fitcry is painting pictures, following
whither his portrait commissions lead
him. and that their long semmer holiday
is spent together. Surely, 'therefore, they
should not be expected to share this gold
en time with strangers, no matter how
warm their admiration.
Then 1 think of her gracious mvlta
tlon and the happiness that has been in
my heart ever since I knew I was ac-
tually to meet her face to face and I
realize that nothing could induce me to
forego this visit to Vallombrosa.
Vallombrosa, known of old for its mon-
M'Ty, represents the perfection of Ap-
loveliness. Here are a few hotels
and sanitariums, hidden as if ashamed
among the fir trees, whose guests *flnd
peace and immunity from the world; two
cr three American millionaires have
summer homes on nearby hilltops, and
several families from aristocratic Flor
ence spend the hot months here In the
feudal strongholds of their ancestors.
To me the twenty-mile trip seems a
fitting approach to my divinity. Yellow
fields and vineyards lie on either side of
the road at the beginning of the drive,
but higher up are unbroken forests of
chestnut and beech and fir. # "As thick
as leaves In Vallombrosa." The line runs
happily through my memory' and I can
not wonder that Milton drew upon this
scene in his description of paradise.
The road that eventually leads up to
the terrace of II Torre <Je Campiglio (hap
py abode of art and good-fellowship, as
we would translate the name of the
Story home) Is so tangled and irregular
as to suggest a cleverly contrived puzzle,
but the puzzle solves itself, in time, and
I rfach the open living-room, the porch
or loggia (of which I secured a charming
photograph), where Mr. Story welcomes
me.
I am wondering all the while how I

Let me tell you: Kiddie comes home
for his spring vacation. We has him at
our house, because little Fannie likes him
for to play wit. and Mr. Paul says dat de
boy can't come too early under his

fure eating, and after meals, and during
grub times. I don't know Is it good for
goils and women, but Mr. Paul says. it's
better dan gold for boy kiddies. -It's
better dan de gold cure anyway.
Well, Kiddies arrives wit bote feet # and
his suit case filled wit marbles, tops, and
football harness, to be mended, and Mr.
ft'^x:) says to him, "Well, Master Emmet,
Wi;at shall we do to be saved V
"I like ice cream and de soicus wit

Kiddie, "but if dere js any odder kind of

I shall talk with her on subjects suita
ble for a goddess. In an Instant, out she
steps in a white duck skirt and drawn
work shirt waist, and she says cordially,
"It is fine In you to 'come. Have some
seltzer." This; from my divinity!
There is a hearty, laugh from, a group
on the terrace and she turns to call,
"Don't tell any. stories without me." Then
to me she adds. "Let us go over there.
One can never afford to miss a good
laugh and German dialect Is too rare on
these premises to be slighted. I often
wish I had one of my own or that Joe

she always feels during a pcriormancu

She spoke, too. of her discomfiture one

Is in them.
Shortly before luncheon the gray-haired
butler announced the tailors and the com
pany trooped Into the hall and prepared^
for the fitting of their hunting coats. The
coat of the hostess was of dark green
duck, bristling with pockets, a most re
markable one stretching aeroa* My* rjfcjua*
in which she slipped her pet .'tLahtUnnft

The coats were made to measure and
the country tailor* had walked twelve
miles uphill for the fittings. They seem
ed not at all fatigued, however, but skip
ped about as lightly as dancing masters,
and finally bowed themselves out with
the grace of courtiers.
It made me \u25a0 think of a little court, a
pleasant court with modern manners in
a medieval setting, though the house, for
all its fifteenth century air, is as new
as the frame dwellings that , line the
streets In San Francisco. Every one of
the stones In its walls was taken from
the estate and all the timber In the raf
ters and the paneling came from the for
ests now cleared from the fields. It was
the Intention, in the first place, to drive
through the wide doors that opened on
the roadway directly into the great hall,
after the manner of medieval days, but.
by degrees, luxurious divans were intro
duced, book shelves were put up, reading
tables with big lamps were found a com-;
fort, and a raised platform for the grand
piano was built at -one end, so the great
hall became the favorite lounging place in
the house.
The dining-room and a delightful recep
tion-room occupy the. first floor of the
tower, both of them with quattro cento
mantelpieces that Mr. Story picked up
on the demolishment of old palaces in-
Florence. There is one in the hall, too,
as you will see from one of the pho
tographs here shown. It is fully ten feet
high and as all of them are of carved
stone, the ."picking up" process consisted
in loading them on his ox carts, piece by
amusement, and tings to. eat, dat. suits
you better," he. says, "I'll not stand out
for my choice."
"You has struck me just at de high
tide of me most loved amusements," says
Mr. Paul, **co we can start in dis very
afternoon as^ ever . was wit a visit to de
soipt's. I suppose we might take little
Fannie along, eh?','.
"Oh, yes," says Kiddie. "Goils can't
be helped; and as long as dey don't say
notting, and don't get scared at de cl I
phants,'\u25a0 we may as well take tier
along." ,
"My views of de fair sex, .exactly,'?

Bhe doesn't remainin a small room where
the smoke is thick, not because her throat

early in the afternoon the household re

-Mrs. Story led me to a large, cool room,
with, the hot sunshine slanting through
the - wooden : shutters, . saw that the bed
was readyfor complete repose and tapped
on .the door a minute later with the offer
of a negligee "which won't fit, \>ut please
take It."
She herself rested for a few minutes
only and then drove over the farms, in -a,"
little dog cart with a pony in the shafts,
a big hound frantically along
side.
. I wish I could make you see the dogs
that are the particular delight of the
Storys. They are all sizes and kinds,
ranging from one 'remarkable specimen
(built like .a cplt, feathered like an os
trich, with the 'antics of a chimpanzee),
whose pedigree runs back to a Scotch
sheep dog belonging to Sir Walter Scott,
and of , the same \u25a0 breed as "Bob, Son of
Battle,'.*^ to -the little brown dachshund

logsia. we played tennis on. the coart at
the rear of tfie houae. A number of vis
itors from neighboring places called,
among them an Italian* Countess, who
spoke English as perfectly as did the two
slim Boston girls present, and was as
pleased as amused at being thought an
American.' There was a beautiful silvery
haired Marchesa. too. who claimed Amer
ica as h*r home, though she had never
seen it. and who inquired most eagerly
after the life at Cape Cod. where her
daughter was spending a novel and very
happy summer.
The dressing bell put an end to the
game and I was taken by my hostess to
her own room in the second story of the
tower. \ ~
"We do not dress for dinner." one said,
though I very well knew that the t or- â¢
mallty had been dispensed with out ot
graceful courtesy to me, as I had no
evening toilette. "The gong rings, but
this' half hour i 3 set apart for watching
the sun sat. Come to my window. Do
you wonder that I love it?*'
The tops of tho hills were still bright
with light, but the valleys were filled
with purple haze that even as we watch
ed if grew deeper. The firs that hid the
old monastery seemed a splash of ink
against the lighter green, and the air
was stlil save for the sudden sweet thrill
of a bird. .
"Listen." whispered the other * singer.
"that is the nightingale. I come here
every evening to drink in the glory of
this scene and that little bird seldom falls
me. Is it not the most exquisite thing
In the world? When I hear it. every
care In life slips away and I am glad
just to be alive that I may stand and
listen."
' "Do you ever wish you were a port ot
this srtat Italy?" I asked her.
"So," she said, "though it must b*
very wanderful to be kin to the men who
once ruled this country by might. If not
by right. My husband's sister married
into a family whos*> nobility is of the -
purest in Italy. It was the head of their
house who came to the financial aid of
Edward of England, who offered the
crown of England as security, but never
theless failed to meet his obligations and
the family has been impoverished ever
since. I told the Kingâ when he wa*
still Prince of Walesâ that he owed my
sister's people for his three feathers, and
he laughed and said he had often heard
the story. Hut he didn't send a check.
No," she continued, "I would rather be
just Emma Eamts with the strength to
mold my life from new clay than to in
herit a title that carries with it the re
strictions and obligations of a thousand
year 3 of noble blood." \u25a0
I did not reply. I looked back into the
half-darkness of the spacious room, with
ItÂ»" rare inlaid furniture, its / historic
carved bed and the long Venetian mirros;
I looked at the splendid woman at my
'side who was listening so intently to'
tho song of a bird In the hedge, a. woman
who could jest with a monarch, trans
form an audience into sobbing, cheering
worshipers, and offer so genuine a nos
pitality that the least among her ad
mirers would feel herself a princess; and
as I looked I wondered what could be
finer than to be "ju3t Emma Eames. "
That was before .dinner. The meal,
served with such ceremony, was onÂ© of
heights and depths, of serious thought
and happy stories. Music came in for
Its share of attention, from the last Wag
nerian production to the popular* songs
of the season. A fragment, of "Tamany"
was sung by a voice that will go down In
history and the chorus waa taken up in
many keys by the dinner guests and fin
ished with complete satisfaction to them-,.
â¢ selves, at least.
Later on, In the hall, there was more
music/ the offering of the gracious
hostess. We had all heard her sing be
fore, but it was not Madame Emma
Eames cf the Grand Opera that stood be
fore us now. It was Mrs. Julian Story
singing to her friends.
;J In the hush that followed the son*
came an answering note from the chest
nut tree near the terrace. It was the
nightingale singing to Mrs. Story.

ON BATLESHIPS
By an Officer of the Russian Second
Torpedo-Boat Division.
*Â» ye OW that I stand, once more on
/\ I American soil. In the country
I where, a few years ago. it was
V^ *\u25a0 my privilege to reside as in
spector of a ship that was
building for the Russian imperial
navy. I find It dlfflcult to realize that
in the brief interval one of the most
stupendous naval and military dramas
in the history of the world has been
enacted, and that I myself have been
en active participant in that long fore
told struggle for supremacy in the
Far East, which all of us knew was
coining, but which none of us sup
posed was coming so soon, or with
such swift and tragic results.
â¢ It is not my intention to write in
any detail of my experience, but
rathef to record some of the deeper
Impressions that have been left on my
rnlnd by that never-to-be-forgotten
eleven months of my ' life. _ during
which, as an officer on one of the Rus
sian torpedo-boat destroyers, I was
actively and Incessantly engaged in
the defense of the doomed city and
fortress of Port Arthur.
We d.d ::ot know it then â we know
it too well now â that the issue of the
Â«iav&] campaign was practically deter
mined by the fatal night attack of
February i. xvith which the Japanese
opened the war. When i*t was made
known on the morning of February 9
that the two finest battleships of our
fleet, the tlagship Czarevitch and the
American built Retvizan, and also the
cruiser Pallada. had been put out of
commission for .several months to come
by the torpedo we realized that Japan,
with her six battleships and eight arm
ored cruisers, possessed a numerical
and actual superiority in ships of the
first line of battle, which insured to
her, right at the very outset of the
war, the invaluable advantage con
ferred by the possession of the com
mand of the sea.
Ix-t it net be supposed, however, that
there was any discouragement in the
l'orl Arthur fleet, sorely stricken though
It was, or any doubt as t<J the eventual
outcome of the war thus so suddenly
thrust upon us. although heaven knows
that the outlook was gloomy indeed. The
torpedo attack and the naval battle out-
Bide the harbor next day had left us with
â¢several ships disabled by shots below the
water line and three of the largest vessels
badly wrecked by the torpedoes. All of
these ships fchould have gone into dry
dock for repairs. Yet there was but one
dock, and that of moderate dimensions
available at Port Arthor. Evidently'!!
would take many months to put the fleet
in condition to fight a line engagement
with the Japanese. The Imperial navy, it
is true, possescd in the Baltic sufficient
ships to form a fleet but littje Inferior to
the Srst Pacific squadron, bift we all
knew that it would take many months' to
complete the four battleships of the Boro
dina class and commission the older bat
tleships and cruisers, and that it would
take many months more to bring the re
inforcements around; half the world to
Port Arthur. Moreover, as I shall show
later, although the fortifications guarding
the sea approaches to the j fortress were
completed and fully equipped, the land
defenses and their gun emplacements
were only partially, built.' and there was
scarcely a gun available to arm them.
If Port Arthur was to be. defended on the
land side " ft was * evident that the forts
would have to be equipped with guns
taken from . the fleet Itself/, and this was
done in the later days of. the siege. -
Before : proceeding % further let me say
that In spite of the successful torpedoing
of our ships In the : nigbt attack,; I am
convinced, after reviewing the events -of
eleven months of the most- arduous and
Incessant torpedo-boat service, both "on
the Japanese ; side | and bur , own; i that .the
torpedo-boat destroyer, has signally failed
to come up to the high expectations: that
bad been formed. Too much > importance
must i not ; be attached . to the \ success { of

V y ried?"
This ia a question which
Is premature, yet it is one that Is being
asked by a score of friends in "Wash
ington who foresee a wedding, in the
not too far distant future. In the White
House.
"She will choose something distinc
tively American." predicted a young
woman who is very close to the Presi
dent's family, "and her colors will be
blue as possible, all shades of blue.
from Alice blue to a pale Ehade of tur
quoise."
"How about the new English styles?**
asked some one, "the distinctive Eng
lish fashions \u25a0which are gaining so
much ground in this country?"
"She will have none of them." was
th* reply. "She is too decidedly an
American."
The distinctive English styles to
which" the speaker referred have become
very pronounced ct -Tite. LÂ»c-dori Is-try
ing to act the part of revivalist in
fashions, and many of the new gowns
are -distinct fiepartures from the beaten
path in dressmaking.
London is trying to bring back the
long: skirt and many of the new fashion
plates show the London ladies walking
in the streets with their gowns lifted
in the hand. "The short skirt has been
in style long enough." say the dress
makers, "and now we must have some
thing entirely new."
It Is whispered that the long skirt will
be Immensely popular wlti. the modistes
not for onÂ© reason alone, but for several.
For one thing the long skirt Is a fragile
tkirt. ' It soon gets dusty and worn upon
the border, and. In this condition, no fas
tidious woman will wear it. This neces
sitates a constant .making over and a
continual turning and retrimmlng, which
Is good business for the modistes.
Again the very long skirt requires trim
ming. When . dresses dragged they were
trimmed. They had wide bands of silk
and cloth upon them and flounces and
beadings. passementeries and applica
tions. They \u25a0were leng and severe and
they needed decoration.
At return to the long ekirts would mean
almost an entirely new wardrobe for
e\-ery woman. Few women own to-day
more than one or two long skirtsâ aside
from their evening gownsâ RÃ d If they
were to go Into long dresses they would
need everything new. Tou cannot make
over a short skirt Into a long one. how
ever much you may want to do bo. Tou
must buy a new oae and this makes busi
ness brisk for those who make the gowns.
A Retura to Long Skirts.
"We must not be blamed for longing
to see Dame Fashion turn backward to
ward the trained Ekirts again," said a
very fashionable dressmaker. "Nor must
we be censured for desiring a state of
dress which Is neither as healthful nor as.
sanitary as the present.
"The fact of the matter is that the long
skirt is more becoming and we modistes
who are compelled to wrestle with the
problem of making women look graceful
resJize this as none others do. If all wo
men were tall and slender it would be. dif
ferent. But when we have the stout sis
terhood to deal with we realize our diffi
culties.
"And that is why we look upon the
new London gowns with a great deal of
pleasure. Their long lines suit us ex
actly.**
Not only in favoring the return of the
. long skirt is London coming to the front.,
but In other things. She is trying to.
rule the fashionable world all along the
line. And particularly is this seen tn the
wedding gowns which London Is trotting
out. They are made upon new lines, and
would hardly be recognized as being of
the vintage of the present year. They
are almost quaint In their general aspect.
There was a time when every bride
wore an Irish poplin gown. It was
thought more elegant than satin and, in.
white Irish poplin, trimmed with lace,
che went to the altar. Irish poplin, near
\ A
ly all silk and enormously expensive, Is
being worn by brides again. It is heav
ily trimmed with lace flounces and over
her head the bride wears the dainty lit
tle wedding veil of pure lace.
The very fashionable bride now wears
the sweeping veil of silk net. It Is very,
line and is fastened upon the back of her
head as though it were upon a little
framework of wire. It fits the crown of
her head. This veil is very long and very
â¢wide and is arranged to sweep the floor
behind. It covers the gown and makes
the bride one long, graceful vision in
spotless white.
But, if she be a very smart bride, she
will wear a second veil, which Is very
short and Email. It Is made of real lace
and costs' way up in the hundreds. It
is gathered, as upon a tiny tiara and is
fastened on top of the head. It is -thrown
back so that it falls over the bride's
shoulders. This Is called the bride's veil.
This is one of the.Jatest London fads.
A Fashionable American Wedding.
At a fashionable American wedding
the other day the bride wore a white
satin gown cut princess. It was skin
tight all the way from the round neck
downward until It arrived at the sweep
of the train. This gown, which was
of that spotless white which is dazzling
to the eyes, was fitted with a precision
which suggested waxwork.
To make the princess gowns fit these
days the dressmakers have . a new
wrinkle, which, while it makes lots i of
work. Is Immensely satisfactory'when
completed, providing it be well done*.
The gown is made so that It needs no
corset. Being a princess gown /it Is
cut to hug the figure. It fits perfectly
all the way. Then, to make it set bet
ter, and to make it very tight ' to ; the
figure, it is boned. And here the as
sistance of a corset maker Is needed.
The corset maker takes the woman's
measurements, and, with cunning 1 fin
gers, she makes a corset inside the
gown. There are many bones,: and in
front', there is a wide steel.* The sides
are boned to perfection and' the. corset
laces down the v back, where : the open-;
Ing Is. When the lacings are com
pleted the gown is hooked by means of
a. flap. This makes the flg-ure very
slender - and causes the gown to fit as
though one were melted Into It. It Is
along these lines that the new wed
ding gowns are made.
â¢ A" fashionable woman of this city,
preparing to -attend 1 an elegant wed
ding, ordered a very, fine gown . for the

Its trimmings,: were : peachblow ' and
white laoe,\wlth rows of dyed lace and]

The bones, were put'ln so that they did

that no corset '; was ",-. required under

A Smart Bridal Procession.
At a fashionable wedding to be solem
nized soon the bride will _ lead the way,
walking alone, as she has no father and
tier mother prefers to follow the new
mode of remaining In the front seat of
the middle aisle. So the bride will lead
the procession. Next will come the short
est of the bridesmaids, all dressed In the
new color, a "soft pale yellow. Next will
come a bridesmaid In pale pink, then one
In pale violet, then one in light blue. This
programme will be repeated, as there are
eight bridesmaids. And one after another
they will walk down the aisle, one pretty
succession of color. The sight at the
dress rehearsal was lovely beyond com
pare. 'The colors were delicate and the
materialâ a gleaming chiffon with trim
mings of satin to matchâ made the gowns
very attractive. In her right hand each
bridesmaid will carry a small shower
bouquet to exactly match her gown. The <
flowers will be sweet peas. Bride roses,
forget-me-nots and yellow roses.
The English bride of tha season Is wear
ing a short-waisted bridal gown cut on
early English lines. If pretty, she Is part
ing 'her hair In the middle and she Is
wearing a bunch of flowers over each ear.
Two small lace veils are fastened each
with a bunch. of flowers pinned over the
coiffure. This make 3 a pretty head orna
ment. Indeed.
An English bridal gown was made with
a short waist and full shirred skirt, one
of those quaint dresses one sees occa-
slonally. The sleeves were puffed at tb,e
shoulder and were cut off at the elbows,
and the, neck was cut square and filled
in with lace. The bridal veil was a long"
one. very fine and embroidered prettily. t
It was a net veil of chiffon, one of the
new sort just introduced this season.
A handsome Dutch gown was presented
by Wllhelrnina recently to one of her
friends, the daughter of a rich Amster
dam merchant. The material was the
heaviest of glittering satin, and the only
trimming was a mass of embroidery
around the hem put on narrow in front
and wider toward the back, in Spanish
fashion.
v The color of the satin. Instead of being
a parÂ© white, was silvery, the effect be
ing obtained by the -weaving of a few
silver threads In the material. The veil
was a sliver chiffon, and the gloves were
sliver white' slllc. woven long and made
to order. The Dutch neck was cut round
and not filled with lace, but was seml
decollete. The bride wore pearls and car
ried a pearl prayer book.
Pearls the Jewels for the Bride.
Pearls seem to be the fashionable
bride's jewels this . season. If you are
contemplating being a bride, or If you
have a friend who 13 looking at bridal
finery, get pearls. There are uses this
season for every pearl that can be added
to the costume. A pearl dog collar is
worn with a necklace attached to It.
One of the new bridal gowns is eat with
a French neck, rather low and round.
The bride will wear a d.og collar of five
strings with two loose strings below,
hanging well over the corsage.
Another bride will have her veil fas
tened with beautiful strings of pearls
while her throat and wrists will al3o
be encircled. Their pure milky white
ness -goes well with the glistening
silk. "Diamonds for the elderly wom
an/ ' Â«ald a fashionable Jeweler, "but
pearls for the bride."
The bride, in her trousseau, can se
lect the new peacock tones, for super
stition has vanished as to their use,.
They are now considered, good tasta.
Gowns of changeable blue and green
silk are trimmed with peacock but
tons, made to look like the peacock
"eyes," and there are embroidered pea
cock feather designs upon evening and
dinner dresses. A beautiful cloth dress
Is trimmed with peacock blue velvet,
while the coat Is made of navy blue
cloth, elaborately trimmed with pea
cock velvet bands. The two color*,
blue and green, are combining well.
, It Isn't always the most expensive
gown which looks the best, and this
Intelligence makes good reading for
the woman who is making her own,
gowns and who longs to look aa well
as the woman next door, who buys
hers in Paris. Taste is a great deal.
but it Isn't everything, and It comes
pretty near to being the whole battle*
so any modiste will tell you â tasta and
good fitting, for a gown must fit.
Gowns In the Far Ernst.
.They are telling wonderful stories
of the gowns which Miss Alice Roose
velt is wearing in her Journey round
the world,' as a member of Secretary
Taft's party. Not that the gowns aro
so fine, but that they are In such good
taste. They seem to typify the oc
casion and ths country In every pos
sible way.
Accompanied by Congressman Long
worth and a chaperon, she made a call
the other day upon an American woman
,in Jolo. Her gown was the prettiest red
and blue, not gaudy, but In the most
charming taste. The material was thÂ»
new French taffeta without gloss and
with some body, while the style was
somewhat on the order of a shirt waist
suit.
There was a little vest of French red.
and the pipings upon the sleeves were,
of the same shade. The skirt followed
the French lines and was untrimmed.

CHAPTER XXVII.
A Domestic Discord.
ry*r FTER a month in the. South I
f I was well again â younger In
fâ j feeling and in looks than I had
VÂ» I been for ten years. Carlotta and
the children, except "Junior,"
who was in college, had gone to Wash
ington when I went to Florida. I
found her abed with a nervous at
tack from the double strain of the
knowledge that Junior had eloped
with an "impossible" woman he
had met. I shall not say where, and of
the effort of keeping the calamity from
me until she was sure he bad really en
tangled himself hopelessly.
fc'r.e was now sitting among -ier pillows,
telling the wnole story. "If he only hadn't
married her!" she ended. :
This struck me as ludicrousâ a' good
woman citing to her son's discredit the
fact that he had goodness' own Ideals of
honor.
"What are- you laughing at?" she de
manded.
! I was about to tell her I was hopeful of
the boy, chiefly because he had thus
*ho\V:i the splendid courage that more
than redeems folly. But I refrained. I
liad never been able to make Carlotta
understand me or my ideas, and I had
long been weary of the resentful silences
or angry tirades which mental and tem
peramental misunderstandings produce.
"Courage never gets Into a man unless
it's born there," said I. "Folly is born
Into us all and can be weeded out.".
"What can be expected?" she went on,
after trying in vain to connect my re
znark with our conversation. "A boy
needs a father. You've been so busy
with your infamous politics that you've
given him scarcely a thought."
Painfully true throughout; but It was
one of these criticisms we can hardly
endure, even when we make it upon our
selves. I was silent.
"I've no patience with men!" she went
â¢ en. "They're always meddling with things
that would get along better without
them, and letting their own patch run to
Unanswerable. I held my peace.
"What are you going to do about It.
Harvey? How can you be so calm? Isn't
there anything that would rouse you?"
"I'm too busy thinking what to do to
waste any energy in blowing off steam,"
was my answer in my conciliatory tone.
"But there's nothing we can do," she
retorted, with increasing anger, which
vented itself toward me because the true
culprit, fate, was not within reach.
â¢'Precisely," I agreed. "Nothing."
"That creature won't let him come to
ccc me."
"And you mustn't ccc him when he
â¢ends for you." said L "He'll come as
coon as his money gives out. She'll see
that he does."
"But you aren't going to cut him off?"
"Just that," said I.
A long silence, then I nodded in answer
to her expression: "And you must not
let him have a cent, either."
In a gust of anger, probably at my
having read her thoughts, she blurted
out: "One would think It was your
money."
I had seen that thought in her eyes,
had watched her hold It back be
hind her set teeth, many 'times
in our married years. And I now thanked
my stars 1 had had the prudence to
get ready for the inevitable moment
when she would speak of It. But at tha
â¢ 6 ame time I could not restrain a flush
ef shame. "It is my money," I forced
myself to say. "Ask your brother. He'll
"tell you what I've forbidden him to
tell beforeâ that I have twice rescued
you and him from bankruptcy."
"With our own money," she retorted,
hating herself for saying It, but goaded
on by a devil that lived in her temper
and had got control many a time, though
never before when I happened to be the
one with whom she was at outs,
"Koâwith my own," I replied tran
jQUlily.
"Tour own!" ehe sneered. "Every dol
lar you have has come through what
you got by marrying me â through what
you married me for. Where would you be
If you hadn't married me? Tou know
very well. You'd still be fighting poverty
as a small lawyer In Pulaskl, married
to Betty Crosby or whatever her name
was." And she burst Into hysterical
tears. At last she was showing me the
eecrets that had been tearing at her.
â¢vr&t ehowlng me her heart where they
had torn It.
"Probably," said I in my usual tone,
when she was calm enough to hear me.
â¢â¢So, that's what you brood over?"
"Yes." she sobbed, "* re'hated you and
myself. Why don't you 1 tell me it isn't
co? m believe Itâ l don't want to hear
the truth. I know you don't love me,
Harvey. But Just say you don't love
her."
"What kind of middle-aged, maudlin
moonshine Is this anyway?" said I.
"Let* s go back to Junior. We've passed
the time of life when people can talk
sentimentality without being ridiculous."
"That's true of me, Harvey," she said
miserably, "but not of you. You don't
look a day. over forty â you're- still a
young man, while Iâ"I â "
She- did not need to complete the sen
tence. I eat on the bed -beside her and.
patted her vaguely. She took my hand '
and kissed It. And I saidâ l tried to
say It gently, tenderly, sincerely: "People
who've been together, as you and I
have, ccc each other always as at first,
they Bay."
She kissed my hand gratefully again.
"Forgive me for what I said,"
ehe murmured. "You know I didn't
think it. really. I've got such aya v
nasty disposition end I felt so down, and
âthat was the only thing I could find to
throw at you."
"Please â please!" I protested. "Forgive
Isn't a word that I'd have tha right to use
to any one.**
"But I mustâ"
"Now, I've known for years." I went
on, "that yon were in love with that other
man when I asked you to marry me. I
night have taunted you with that, might
have told you how I've saved him from
going to Jail for passing worthless
checks.**
This delighted herâ this Jealousy so long
end so carefully hidden. Under cover of
her delieht I escaped from the witness
stand. And the discovery that evening by
Doc Woodruff that my son's ensnarer had
a husband living put her In a high good
humor!"" "If he'd only come home," said
ehe. adding: "Though, now I feel that
he's perfectly 6afe with her."
"Yesâ let them alone " I replied. "He
has at least one kind or senseâ a sense of
honor. And I suspect and hope that he
has at bottom common sense, too. Let
him find her out lor himself. Then, he'll
be done with her, and her kind, for good."
'I must marry him off as soon as possi
ble." said CaTlotta. "I'll look about; for
Eome nice. Quiet young girl, with charac-'
ter and looks and domestic tastes." ' She
laughed a little bitterly. "You men can
profit by experience and Itvruins vs _ wo
men."
"Unjust." said I. "but Injustice and stu
pidity are the ground plan of life." .
We had not long to wait. The lady, as
toon as Junior reached the end of ' his
cash, tried to open negotiations. Failing
and becoming convinced that he bad been
cast off by his parents, she threw aside
her mask. One straight look Into her real
countenance was enough for the boy. He

clerk In Chicago.
"Why not let him shift for himself a

"I think the boy's got hlÂ» grandmother

chance." \
"Hg'll make a career for himself yetâ
like his father's," said Woodruff.
That, with the slncerest enthusiasm.
But Instinctively I looked at him for
signs of sarcasm. And then I won

CHAPTER XXVIII.
Under a Crayon Portrait.
It was now less than a month before
inauguration. Daily the papers gave
probable selections for the high posts
under the approachins administration;
and, while many of them were attrib
uted to my influence, Roebuck's son as
Embassador to Russia was the only
one I even approved of. As payments
for the services of the plutocracy they
were unnecessary and foolishly lavish:
as preparations for a renomination and
re-election, the two guiding factors in
every plan of a President-elect, they
were preposterous. They were first
steps toward an administration that
would make Scarborough's triumph In
evitable in spite of his handicap of
Idealism.
I sent Woodruff west to find out
what Burbank was doing about the
Places I had pledged â all of them less
"honorable," but. more lucrative of
fices which party workers covet.
He returned In a few days with
the news that, according to the
best information he could get through his
Epics in Burbank's entourage, all our
pledges would be broken; the Sayler-Bur
bank machine was to be made over, into
a Goodrich-Burbank.
I saw that I could not much longer de
lay action. But I resolved to put it off
until the very last minute, meanwhile
trying to force Burbank to send for me.
Sly cannonade upon Goodrich In six thou
sand newspapers, great and small,
throughout the West and South had been
reinforced by the bulk of the opposition
press. I could not believe It was to be
without influence upon the timid Bur
bank. even though he knew -who was
back of the attack and precisely how I
was directing It. I was relyingâ as I aft
erward learned, not in vainâ upon my
faithful De Milt to bring to "Cousin
James' " attention the outburst of public
sentiment against his guide, philosopher
and friend, the Wall street fetch-and
carry.
I had fixed on February 15 as the date
on which I would telegraph a formal de
mand for an Interview. On February 11
he surrenderedâ he wired, asking me to
come. I took a chance; I wired back a
polite request to be excused, as I had
urgent business In Chicago. And twenty
four hours later I j passed within thirty
miles of. Rlvington on my way to Chicago
with Carlottaâ we were going to see Ju
nior, hugely proud of himself and his $27
a week. At the Audftorium a telegram
waited from Burbank: He hoped I would
come as soon as I could; the matters he
wished to discuss were most important. I
Toward noon of the third day there
after we were greeting each o^herâ he
with an attempt at his old-time cordial
ity, I without concealment qf at least the
coldness I felt. But my manner appar
ently, and probably, escaped his notice.
He was now blind and drunk with the
Incense that had been whirling about him
In dense clouds for three months; he was
incapable of doubting the biles of any
human being he was gracious to. He shut
me in with him and began confiding tha
plans he and Goodrich had made â Cabinet
places, foreign posts and so on. His voice,
lingering and luxuriating upon the titlesâ
"my Embassador to his Britannic Majes
ty," "my Embassador to the German Em
peror," and so onâ amused and a lit
tle, but only a little, astonished me; I
had always known that he was a
through-and-through snob. For near
ly an hour I watched hit ingenuous,
childish delight In bathing himself In
himself, the wonderful fountain of all
these honors. At last he finished, laid
down his list, took off his hose
glasses. "Well, Harvey, what do you
think?" he asked, and : waited with
sparkling eyes for my enthusiastic ap
proval. . .
"I see Goodrich drove a hard bar
gain," said I. "Yet he came on his
knees If you -had but realized It."
Burbank' b color mounted. "What. do
you mean, SaylerT" he inquired,, the
faint beginnings of the Insulted god
In his tone and manner. .
"You asked my opinion," I answered,
"I'm giving It ,I, I : don't recall a single
name that Isn't obviously a" Goodrich
suggestion. Even the Roebuck ap
pointment â "
"Sayler," he Interrupted, in a for
bearing tone. "I; wish you would not
remind me bo often of your prejudice
against Senator Goodrich. It .Is un
worthy of you. But for my tactâ par-;
don my franknessâ your. : : prejudice
would have driven : him away, and with
him a support he controls â "
I sbov/ed my amusement.
"Don't 'smile,- Sayler." he* protested
with some anger in his smooth, heavy
voice. "You are not the only strong:
manin the party. And 'I! venture to
take advantage of bur long ; friendship
to speak plainly to you.^-I wish to see
a united party. .One ; of â¢: my,- reasons ;for F

greatly I ' am distressed ' and chagrined '
by the attacks on Senator Goodrich In
our papers." sl|iÂ§Â§iÂ§l
"Did .you have any other reason for
sending- for me?" said I very quietly.
"That was the principal one," hÂ«
confessed. /
"Oh!" I exclaimed.
"What do you mean*. Sayler?"
"I thought .- possibly you' might- also
have wished to tell me' how., unjust^, you
thought the attacks on me ;in the East

had only strengthened our friendship."

the ; grownT people runtll.vwhen: he v went
Into the .White '\u25a0. House," he and , I were
t.ie only, two on speaking- terms. I see
now^that this situation had large influ
ence;on" me In holding aloof and wait
ing ;always* for "overtures from .. him."
'At the* time ]I \ thought, as " no ' doubt '\u25a0 he \u25a0
thougrhtTalso.Tthatfthe quarrel was be- -
; neath ;the notice of ; men.
/-'-/ A t; any ; rate V niy,- family : decided not â¢
-.; to come to during, his nrst'
wlnter^lnlthe"' White' House. * I 'lived
>alone"at the* Willard.' ;One afternoon
? toward : > th"e : end .of February I; returned :
-there frbnuthe Senate and! found Wood-;
:rufl, \u25a0'> bad "news : In ; his face. ' "What ; is :
it?" I asked indifferently, for X assumed
it was some political tangle.
. . "Your . wifeâ was taken â very Ill
very suddenly." he skid. His Â«yÂ«s told
me the rest.
If I had ever asked myself how this
news -would affect me. I should h&va.
answered that it would give ma a sen
sation of relief. But/ instead of relief,
_. I felt the- stunning blow of a watÂ» of
'sorrow which has nerer wholly receded.
Not because I loved herâ that X never
. did. V Not x because she -was : the â¢ mother
of my childrenâ my likes. and dlsllkss
are direct and personal. Not beoausa
: she was my wifeâ that bond had. been
f;allinsr. Not because I was fond ot her/
âshe had" one of those cold, angry na
tures'that forbid affection. .No; I was
overwhelmed because sha and I had
been Intimates, with all the olosot In
terests-of lit* In common, with ta*
whole " world. ,' â¢ yen , my children whom
I loved passionately, outslda that elrols
1 which fat* had drawn around us two.
I Imagine this Is not uncommon among
married people â thl a unhealabls break
in their -.routine ; of .association when
one departs. ' No doubt It often' passes
. with the unthinking for lova belatedly
' discovered.
"She did : not suffer," said "Woodruff
-gently.} "It '.was haart disease. She had
Just corns in from a rids with your eldest
daughter." They were resting and talking*
in high: spirits by the library fire. And
thenâ Â£he end cameâ like putting out thÂ«
light."
Heart-disease! Ofttn I had noted th*
trregular beat "of h*Â» heartâ a throb, a
long pause, a . flutter,"- a short pause, a
throb. . And .1 : could - remember that more
than once the sound had been followed by
the J shadowy appearance. -In thÂ« door of
my mind; 1 of one of those black thoughts
'which v try_ to. tempt hope but only make
it â¢ hide > |n~t shame and ; dread. i\ Now tha
memory, of those occasions tormented me
Into accusing .2 myself of ; having wished
her gone. But It was not so.
She had told 'me she had heart trouble:
but j she had confided to no one that she
.: knew It ' might bring on the end ;at any
moment. She left a letter, sealed and
'addressed to me: . "
."Harveyâ , - â¢â
, "I ' shall never have the courage to tell
you. * yet I : feel you ought . to know. I
think . every one attributes to every on*
else C less shrewdness than he possesses.
I ; know ." you ,: have never/ given m* tha
credit of . seeing . that * you ' did not lov*me. And j-ou were bo kind and con
siderate and bo patient with my moods
thsi no doubt I should have been de
ceived had I not known what love is.
I think, to have loved and to have been
loved develops In a woman a sort of
sixth senseâ sensitiveness to love. And
that had been developed in me, and
when it never responded to your efforts
to deceive me, I knew you did not
love me.
"Well, neither did I love you, though
I was able to hide it from you. And it
has often Irritated me that you were co
unobservant You know now the cause
of many of my difficult moods, which
liave seemed causeleEs.
"I admired you from the first time
we met I have liked you. I have been
proud of you, I would not have been the
wife of any other man in the world, I
would not have had any other father for
my children. But I have kept on loving
the man I loved before I met you.
"Why? I don't know. I despised him
for his weaknesses. . I should never have
married him. though mother and Ed both
feared I would. I think I loved him be
cause I knew he loved me. That is the
way It is with womenâthey seldom love
Independently. Men like to love; women
like to be loved. And, poor, unworthy
creature that he was. still he would have
died for me. though God had denied him
the strength to live for me. But all that
God gave himâ the power to loveâ he gave
me. And so he was different in my eyes
from what he wu in any one's else: in
the world. And I loved him.
"I don't "tell you this because I feel
regret or remorse. I don't: there never
was a wife truer than I, for I .put him
completely aside. I tell you because 1
want you to remember me right after I'm
gone, Harrey. dear. You may remember
how I was eilly and jealous of you, and
think I anj mistaken about my own feel-
Ings. But jealousy doesn't mean .love.
When people really love, I think if s sel
dom that 'they're jealous. -What makes
people jealous usually is suspecting the
other person of having the came sort^of
secret they have- themselves. It hurt my
vanjlty that you didn't -love me, and it
stung me to think youicared for some one
else, just as I did. *
-"I want you to remember me gently.
And somehow I think that after you've
read this you will, even If you did love
some one else. If you ever see this at all,
Harvey â and I may tear it up some day
on impulseâ but if you ever do see j it; 1
shall be Mead and we shall both be free.
And I want you to come to me and look
at me and â " .â¢â¢'-. '
It ended thus . abruptly. No doubt she
had intended to open the envelope and
finish itâ but what more was there to
say? _,-
1 think she must have been content with
the thoughts that were In my mind as I
looked down at her lying in death's in
scrutable calm. I had one of ' my secre
taries hunt out the man she had lovedâ a
Mid, stranded wreck of a. man he had be-,
conse; but since that day he- has been 1
sheltered at least- from the worst of the
buSetlngs to which his incapacity for life,
exposed him. '
There was a time when I despised in
capables; then I pitied them; but latterly -
I have felt for them the sympathetic
sense of brotherhood. Are we not all in
eapables? Differing only In' degree, and
hew slightly- there if we look at ourselves
without vanity; like practice sketches
put upon -the slate by Nature's learning
hand and impatiently sponged away.
CHAPTER XXX.
A Philosopher Itudelr Interrupted.
After the funeral I lingered at our Fre
donla place. There was the. estate to set
y<r, jjtjy: two /laughters -had now. bo one' to
\oij)Â£"aii*r them; ' Junior must* be started
right at learning the business of which
tar would soou be the head, as his uncle
bad* ehbwn himself far too easy going for
large executive responsibility. ' 80,- I
stayed on. doing just enough to keep a
face of plausibility upon my pretexts for
not returning to . Washington. The fact
was that Carlotta's death had deepened
rr.y mcod of distaste Into disgust It had
net me tc brooding over the futility and
pettintss of my activities in politics, of
all activities of whatever kind. I watched
Ed and my children resuming the routine
of their lives, swiftly adjusting them
selves to the loss of one who had been so
dear to them and apparently bo necessary
to their happiness. The cry of "man
overboard," a few ripples, a few tears; the
caillng on. with the surface of the wa
ter smooth again and the faces keen and
bright.
Woodruff -wrote, urging: then he, sent
telegram aftf r telegram. Still I procrasti
nated; for all the effect his letters and
tejegrams had upon me, I might as well
have left th<m unopened. My final an
swer was: "Act as you would if I were
dead."
Probably, -what had given my pessimism
its somberest tone was the attitude of the
public toward Burbank's high appoint
ments. I had confidently predicted that
filling all the high offices with men who
had no interest but "the interests," men
who were notoriously the agents and
servants of the great "campaign contrib
utors, ' would cause a public outcry that
could not bt ignored. The opposition
prÂ«-ES did make perfunctory criticisms;
but nowhere was there a sign that the
people were really angered.
I got the clew to this mystery from my
gardener, who prided himself . on being
strenuously of the opposition party.
"What do you think of the new admin
istration?" said I when I came upon him
one morning at the rhododendron beds.
"Much better than I allowed." said
he.' "Burbank's got good men around
him."
"You approve of his Cabinet?"
"Of course, they're all strong party
men. I like a good party man. I like
a man that UaÂ» convictions and prin
ciples and stands up for 'em."
"Your newspapers say some pretty
severe things about those men."
"So I read." said he, "but you know
how that is, Mr. Sayler. They've got
to poi^Ka 'em to please the party. But
nobody believes much he sees In the
newspapers. Whenever. I read an item
about things I happen to know it's all
wrong. And I guess they don't get it
any nearer right about the things I
don't happen to know. Now all this
here talk of there being so many mil
lionaires â I don't take no kind of stock
in it."
"No?" said L ".
"Of course, some's poor and some's
rich â that's got to be. But I think it's
all newspaper lies about these here big
fortunes and about all the leading men
in politics being corrupt I know it
ain't so about the leading men in my
party, and I reckon there ain't no more
truth In it about the leading men of
your'n. I was saying to my wife last
night 'It's all newspaper lies,* says I,
â¢just like the story they printed about
Mrs. Timmins eloping with Maria Wil
merding's husband, when she had only
went over to Rabbit Forks to visit her
daughter.' No, they can't fool , me â
them papers."
"That's one way of looking at It,'
said L
"It's horse sense," said he.. .
And I have no doubt that to the ay-
erage citizen, leading a small,,*qulet life,
and dealing with affairs, in corner
grocery retail, the ' stupendous , facts of
accumulations of wealth and r whole
sale, far: and wide "purchaseJt'df the
politicians, the vast system of bribery,
with bribes adapted to every taste and
conscience, seem impossibilities, ro
mancings of partisanship 1 and .'envy and !
sensationalism. Nor can he .understand,
the way superior men play the great
games, the heartlessnees of ambition,
the cynicism of political and commer-.
clal prostitution, the sense of : supe
riority to the legal and moral . codes
whlch.comes to most men with success.
"Your average citizen is a hero worship
per, too. : He knows his own and his neigh
; bor's weaknesses,. but he. gapes up at the,
great with glamoured eyes, and listens. to;
their smooth plausibilities as to the read-;
Ing of the gospel from the pulpit He!
belongs to the large mass of those who
believe, not to the small class of those
; who question. But for^the rivalries and
jealousies of euperior men .which have
kept them, always divided Into two par
ties, the ins and the outs, I Imagine the
masses would have remained forever
sunk in the most hopeless, if the raostde
lightful, slaveryâ that In which the slave
"accepts his lowliness as a divine ordi
nance and looks up to his oppressors and.
* plunderers as hero-leaders. And no doubt,
, bo long S3 the exuberant riches of our
country enable the triumphant' class to
"take care of all the hungry who have
intellect enough to make themselves dan
gvrous," we shall have no change-rexcept
occasional spasms whenever a'large.num
ber of unplaced intelligent hungry;, are
forcing the full and'fat to make room'for
them. How long will >thls be?
If our . education did not merely feed
prejudices instead' of- removing them, I
should say not long. As it is, I expect to
"leave the world as wicked and as foolish
as I found it" -At any rate, until the mil
lennium I shall continue to play, the game.
t under the rules of human, natureâ lnstead
of under the rules of 'human ideals, as
does my esteemed friend Scarborough.
And I claim that we practical men are as
Crue and useful servants uf our country
and of "our fellow men as he. If men like
.him are the lljrht, men like us are the
lantern that (shields it from the alternat
ing winds of rapacity and resentment.
But, In running- on about myself, I have
got away from my point, which was how â¢
- slight and even-flimsy a pretense, of'fair
ness will shelter "a man In high place â
and* therefore a. Burbank: "He will fool
the people as easily as he fools himself,"
said I. And more than ever it 1 seemed to
me that I must keep out of the v game of
his administration. My- necessity, of party'
regularity made it impossible- for me to,
-oppose, him;: my equal necessity of not
outraging my' sense of the wise, not; to"
speak of .the decent, made 1 it impossible ;
for me to. abet him. '* " ; V \u25a0\u25a0 ' ". '; -\.
. At : last -Woodruff ; "came in per

/to " m"c . I:- regretted \ that/ I could
not follow my strong impulse to refuse
to see him.. But at sight of his big strong
body and big strong face," with "its typi
cally American careless good humorâ the
cool head, the warm heart,' -the- amused
eyes and. lips that could also harden, into
sternness of resolutionâ at sight of^this
old friend and companion in arms my
mood beÂ£an to lift and I felt him stir
ring in if like sunshine attacking a" fog.
"I know what you've come to say," I
began, "but don't say it. . 1.-! shall' keep'; to
my tent for the present."
"Then you" -won't have a tent to "keep
to." retorted he. ; ,â¢ ' -,)..>.â¢

"That sounds well." said I. â¢ "But the
better the analogy the j worse the logic.
I am going out of the business of making
and working off gold bricks and green
goodsâ and that's . analogy."
"Then you must be going to kill your
self," he replied. "For that's life."
"Public lifeâ active life," said I. "Here,
there- are , other things." And I looked
toward my two daughters, whose laugh
ter reached us from their pony cart just
rounding a distant curve in the drive.
His gaze followed mine and he watched
the two children until they were out of
sight watched them, with the saddest,
hungriest look In his eyes. "Guess you're
right," he said gruffly.
After a silence I asked: "What's the
news?"
A Quizzical smile just curled his lips,
and it broadened into a laugh as he saw
my own ; rather shamefaced smile -or
understanding. "Seems to me." said he,
"that I read somewhere once . how a
king, perhaps it was an emperor, so
hankered for the quiet joys that he got
off the throne and retired to a mon
asteryâ and then established lines of post
horses from his old capital to bring him
the news every half hour or so. I reckon
he'd have taken back. his job If be could
have got It."
"I reckon." said jy '\:-'
"Well," said h<f, "the news is that
they're about to oust you from the chair
manship of the national committee and
from control in this State.*!
"Really?" said I, in an indifferent tone
âthough I felt anything but Indifferent.
"Really," said he. "Burbank Is throw

of 'emâ wherever our fellows. won't turn

buck. He's giving -a dinner at the Audi
torium to-morrow night It's a " dinner
of eleven covers. I think you can guess
who ten of 'em are for. The. eleventh is
for Dominick!"
That was enough. I grasped the sltua
lion instantly. -The . one .weak spot in .
my control -of my State was my haviug
left the city bosses their local power,' ln-;
stead of myself ruling the cities from. the
State capital. Why '\u25a0 had I done this?
Perhaps the bottom reason was that \u25a0'. I
shrank from permitting any part of the â¢
machine for which I was directly respon- :
iible to be Una need by collections from
vice and crime. 1 admit that the dis- ;
Unction between corporate privilege and
plunder and the pickings ad stealings and
prostitutions of individuals is more ap
parent than real. I admit that the kinds
of vice and crime I tolerated are far more
harmful than the ether, sorts , which ", are
petty and make loathed outcasts of their
wretched practitioners. < Still, I : was ; snob Â£
or Pharisee or Puritan to;; feel '
and to act upon the imaginary /.distliic- 1
tion. And so, I had left the city -bosses -
locally independentâ for, without the rev- 1 â¢
enues and other aids from vice ; and i
crime, what city political machine .could ,
be kept up?. j

- I' ate because to eat was" a necessary

As: I' was debating, how to escape and
what one of the'- many other ways of
saving* my friends and lieutenants I
should ;adopt, Dominick touched me on
the.arm.- :"A' word with you. Senator,"
said' he.. .> . : â¢ ; '' \u25a0
"'He.' glanced at -.the others as If he
were debating whether he should order
.them from- the table while he talked
;with' me. ; - If he had ordered It they
would have gone. But restrained, per
haps, by ".his .crude though reverent
Bense : of convention, he rose and â¢ led
the 'way; over, to a corner.
"I want.to tell you. Senator, that as

I saw that he had come to the dinner,
doubtful whether any \u25a0 enterprise
against* me, promising enough for him
to risk embarking, could be launched;
as soon as I entered the room he, like
the rat when the cat interrupted the
rat and mouse convention to discuss
belling It. unceremoniously led -the way
to safety. But this was not one of
those few occasions on which It is wise
to show a man that his lies do not
fool yÂ»u. "I am glad to hear you ' say
these things, Dominick." said I. "I am
glad you are loyal to the' party."
"You can trust me, Senator," said he
earnestly.
"I can trust your common sense," said
I. And I proceeded to grasp this lucky
chance to get away. "I am I leaving," X

It was the end of the attempt to mlae

publicly and strongly advocated the ap
pointment of a Joint committee Impar
tially to investigate all the cities of
.the State, those ruled by my own party
no less than those ruled by the opposi
tion. The committee was appointed
and did Its work so thoroughly that
'there was popular clamor for the tak
ing away of the charters of the cities
and for ruling them from the State Cap
itoL It is hardly necessary to say that
my Legislature and Governor' yielded
to this clamor. And so the semi-inde
pendent petty princes, the urban bosses,
lost their independence and passed
under my control; and the â¢'collections"
which had gone directly to them reach
ed them by way of Woodruff as grants
from my machine. Instead of as reve
nues of their own right.
Before this securing of my home
power was complete. I had my counter
attack upon the Burbank-Goodrich
combine well under way. # Immediately
on my return to Fredonla from the
disastrous dinner. I sent for the Attor-.
ney General of the State, Ferguson. Ha
was an ideal combination of man and
politician. He held to the standards of
private morality as nearly as It is pos
sible for a man in -active public life to
hold to themâ far more nearly than
most men dare or, after they have be
come inured, care, to hold. He always
maintained with me a firm but tactful
independence; he saw the . necessity
for the sordid side of politics,
but he was careful personally to
keep clear of smutched or besmutching
work. He had as keen an - Instinct for
popularity as a bee hat for-blossoms; he
knew how to do or to direct unpopular
things on dark nights with a dark lan
tern; how to do or to direct popular
things in full uniform on a white horse.
I have never ordered any man to a task
that was not morally congenial; and I
was careful to respect Ferguson's notion
of self-respect. I sent for him now, "and
outlined my planâ to bring suits, both
civil and criminal, in the Federal courts
In the %ame of the State, against Roe
buck and his associates of the Power)
Trust . I
When he had heard, he said: "Yes, Mr.V
Sayler, we can break up the Power Trust
can cause the indictment and conviction
of Mr. Roebuck. I can prevent the
United States Attorney General from
playing any of the usual tricks and de
fending the men whom the people think
he is vigorously prosecuting. Butâ"
"But?" said I, encouragingly.
"Is this on the level? If I undertake
these prosecutions, shall I be allowed to
push them honestly? Or will there be a
private settlement as soon as Roebuck
and his crowd see their danger?"
"No matter, what happens." I replied,
"you shall prosecute at least the civil
suits to the end. X glvÂ« you my word for
that" [
He thanked me warmly, for he appre
ciated that I was bestowing upon him an
enormous opportunity for national fame.
"And you?" said L "If you succeed In
this prosecution, will you remain in the
public service or will you accept the of
fers the interests will make, and remove 1
to New York and become * rich corpora
tion lawyer?"
He reflected before answering. "That
depends," said he. "If you are going to
stay on in control In this State I shall
stick to public life, for I believe you will
let me have what I call a career. But if
you are going to get out and leave ma at
the mercy of those fellows, I .certainly
shan't stay where they can fool the peo
ple into turning on me." â¢l?ffiBJ8BW8BB
"I shall stay on," said I; "and after mÂ» t
there will be Woodruffâ unless, of count,
there's some sort of cataclysm,"
- "A man must take chances," hÂ» an
swered. "I'll take that chance.** ;
We called Woodruff Into the oonsulta
tion. Although he was not a lawyer, he
had a talent for taking a situation by
the head and tall and stretching it out
and holding It so that every crease and
v^rinkle in it could be seen. And this
made him valuable at any conference.
In January we had our big battery
loaded, aimed and primed. WÂ« unmask

not hoped for such stupidity aa they ex

Presidential flatteries and ; of fawning on
and cringing .â¢ to the multi-millionaires
and their agents hedging him around had
so wrought upon him that he bad wholly
lost his point of view. And he let his
Attorney General pooh-pooh ths proceed

excitement : and enthusiasm. It was not
until Roebuck's â¢ lawyers got \ far enough
into the case against htm to see his dan
ger that the administration stopped flying
in the teeth of the cyclone of public sen
timent and began to pretend enthusiasm,
while secretly plotting the mistrial of
Ferguson's case. And .not- until -the

CHESTNUT
TIME
THE conviction borne in upon
the minds of intelligent
people of all classes that
â¢we Americans eat too
much meat has led naturally to a
search for substitutes foÂ» flesh
food. In the course of this quest
vegetarianism hes come to tlie
front in great strength. The resolu
tion not to support life by eating
that which must give up its life as
a sacrifice to the appetites or needs
of man has been formulated into a
creed. It is no part of our work
to-day to discuss this branch of
dietetics as a moral principle.
What may be called a ramification
oi this cardinal principle is the
Nut Fau, warmly supported, as
might be expected,- by the advocates
of pure vegetarianism, and almost
as strongly by certain riters and
lecturers upon food values. In a
certain restaurant in New York
city, from which all animal food is
rigorously excluded, I sat down, a
v/hile ago, to a six-course luncheon
in which "Protose" appeared four
times. Analysis of the quartette of
dishes showed that nuts, ground or
beaten to a paste, were the "sub
ject matter" of the food with the,
to me, unfamiliar name.
By way of clearing decks for ac
tion, let me say that, in my humble
opinion, there is no one article of
food or class oÂ£ foods which is di
pestible by every human stomach.
Even milk, pronounced by common

A Trade Over Which One Should Hesitateâ Bookbinding and Its
Successes and Failures ' \u25a0 ;

ONE should hesitate a long time
before taking up wood carving
a* a means of earning a living.
It certainly ranks as the least
remunerative of all professions, and the
number, of carvers far exceeds the de
mand. Carved, furniture is surely a lux
ury, and those who provide th*? luxuries
cf life Buffer when the season of hard
times comet.
"la working for the trade the competi
tion of foreign workmen and improve
ments In machinery must be taken into
account, and in working for friends
there is not much to encourage one.
A certain knowledge of drawing, much
patience, and a escase of the fitness of
r JngÂ» are necessary. Instruction can
be had in schools, and the tools are in
expensive, but It is, you see, not desir
able as a profession for women. In
short, it cannot be depended upon as a
regular or sufficient source of income.
Mrs. Burton, of Santa. Barbara, Cal.,
not long ago made a wedding chest of
wood, leather and metal. The decora
tions were of tulip design in old brass
and Manila oyster shells. The designs
were on illuminated leather. One was
the weaving of the wedding trousseau;
another was "dressing the bride"; the
Uiird was only seen when the doors of
the cabinet were opened. It represented
the wedding ceremony. An order like
this is, of course, exceptional, and work
of this kind cannot be depended upon
ror a living
â¢ â¢ One of the finest woods for carving is
the red cedar; It is not only durable,
but its natural color Is bright. The
:voiy- tv ul i u belly, so smooth and even
in its grain, .is used to make some of
.the most beautiful 'art treasures^ It
lakes the place, to some extent, of rose
wood for piano cases. It is made into
beautiful 'handles of umbrellas and par
asols.. Some books are bound In holly.
Match eafes, writing desks, etc.. arÂ«
made of this wood. For buml-wood
Cdiisuii, the white or yellow holly of
the United States lb best suited. With
this nif often combined the dark tunes
of the oak aud walxut.
L Bookbinding.
high-class houses bookbinding is
done all the year round. A thorough
workman generally has steady work.
There are always a number of appren
tices in these large establishments, and
â¢ there Is where one ought to to to learn.
Beginners have the folding of sheets as
they come from the printers, the col
lecting of sheets "as they come from the
press and the sewing to do. Rebindirig
of old books is given over to women
workers, who have over them a woman
of experience. v f*"'.V ' .. \u0084
The headbanding of fancy books is
done by women. \u25a0 This is the cotton or
Bilk ornament at the head or tail'of
bound volumes. :;;':<â¢!;
Mending books, grafting on new pieces
to the binding of rare old books, takes
skilful workmanship, and is generally
given over to the deft-nngers of women.
Wages range from $3 to $18 or $-0 a
week. -';%'\u25a0 ,\u25a0\u25a0 - - : ''ir: *â¢ '
It is clean, healthful work, and draws
a vtry superior class of girls into it.

Florence Porter. It will give courage to
many women who find . themselves
stranded, yet arc in -n position to do;
something of, the kind.
One "Woman's Success.
Much has been written and said about
Ida Meacham Strobridge and the Arte
mesia bookbindery of Los Angelesâ some
of it true, but much of It an exa'ggera- \
tion of the conditions surrounding a cul
tured and literary woman 'who lived for
several years an isolated and adventure
some life in Nevada. .
Mrs. Strobridge is a native of Call-^
fprnla, and was educated at Mills Sem-^
iijary, Oakland. ' While yet a - young
woman reverses came in the family for
tunes and a removal 4 was made to the
Humboldt Mountains of. Nevada.: It was
there that she awoke to find that "life
wps duty," when the death of her hus
band and the failfng health of her fa
ther made it apparent that she" should
assume the charge of a ranch of SOW
acres. In the discharge of this task,

ful horse, <lay after day was -spent'liT. .

with unerring: aim as she threaded, the
mountain paths or galloped across the
dcsert,and many, a trophy of her marks,
manship is to oe seen in the valuable
skins of* wild animals that now cover
the floor of her spacious den. . //
it -was while leading this wild and iso
lated life that she first became interest
ed in hand bookbinding. She has always
possessed a fine literary taste, and many
unbound magazines filled . â¢ the book
shelves at."Lassen Meadows," for so she
called her; Nevada home. She ; longed to

gather /in. the 'cloakroom while anjr
young - ladies are sitting . par tnerless. * It
Is perfectly correct for him to ask such
selfish guests to : do .him the favor of
dancing with Miss Jones or Miss Gray.
No'manwhois'a gentleman ever* refuses
such a request,- it he has no previous en
gagement, for the dance.
Music and Dances.
It Is no longer the fashion to have -a
formal a "Grand March," or
anything of that sort for balls given in
private ' houses or even in halls er as
sembly rooms, except in. the case of a
few functions given by clubs and mili
tary: organizations. The dancing .begins
as Boon as half a dozen or so couples
have arrived. Naturally, the bigger the
ball the larger the orchestra engaged to
play 'for the festivities. At fashionable
private balls in New ; York -houses, an
orchestra of stringed instruments, or
one '\u25a0 of the ' famous Hungarian bands,
discourses sweet ; music ; for the entire
evening from ' behind a screen of | palms
and: tropical plants. For a smaller. dance
an orchestra* of three or. four "pieces Is
all that is necessary,, while for informal
affairs -and \u25a0 small* country dances
piano alone can be. made" to sufflce. The
waltz i and the .[ two-step,' varied by an
occasional set of i lancers , and the ' co
tillion,, sometimes called the german, are
about ': all the : dances that society * cares
I to "lndulge 'in at present. When the' cb
tilllon Is danced it usually begins directly
after fsupper, unless . the entire evening
ia to be. devoted to It. â¢ ,
' The Supper. â¢' '
*At most large -balls,\unless they are
very- splendid .entertainments given by
millionaires, -the : supper; is served from
the buffet, which means that the guests
do 'not sit down at tables as at a dinner,
but; seat themselves in , chairs placed
against, the ..wall of the dining room, or
even remain in- the ball: room or the li
brary/ and arc serv'cd by the waiters or
the men guests. *,The menu can be as
elaborate or. simple as" Is 'desired. Bbuil
lon.ssalads," escallopcd- oysters, -pates,
sandwiches, l ice cream, fancy cakes and
bonbons are usually offered. And cham
: pagne,"* light : wines *and â¢: claret .' cup ? arc
. served," "awhile tiny'cupstofr black "coffee
make an appropriate ilnule. This Is the
i menu for. a big ball; for. a smaller daneÂ«;, v
bouillon,*iÂ«pneihot. dishi':isuch*'as escal
loped f? oysters ; :;- chicken.' : lobster, or
shrimp *. salad ; â¢* sandwiches, â¢- ice; cream,
cake and coffee will be ample. .At an in
formal affair, even less .will sufnee, and
salad, ice cream, cake and coff.ee are ail
that axe really needed. Throughout GsÂ«
evening punch or lemonade' is served la
an anteroom or a corner of the hall,
so that ths guests can refresh them
selves between the dances.
At large and ceremonious balls- oca
may with perfect propriety arrlva at
any hour before- 12; tout at small dance*
it la considered In better tasta to enter
the ball room within an hour of thÂ« timÂ«
specified in the Invitation.
Etiquette for Girls.
After a young girl has greeted ; her
hostess, she tan, if accompanied, by an
escort, stand talking with him for a few.
moments ' while he Introduces his
friends. Her escort must always daneÂ«
the first dance with : her and take her
out to supper. A girl who comes to. a
dance accompanied by a chaperon,
which Is considered the proper thing in
very; fashionable society, follows her
protector to a seat and remains heside
her until she is invited to dance. After
this she " need not return to her chap
, eronat the end of every dance; If : her
programme is happily - filled, but may
walk about with her escort, accept- a
glass of lemonade, or sit and talk with
him until claimed for the next dance.
It is the girl's place to stop dancta*
first, and she can, If she wishes, daricÂ©
uninterruptedly through the entire num
ber or cease waltzing at any time . shÂ«
pleases, and her partner should at oneÂ«
acquiesce.
No well-bred girl ever refuses a dance
to, one man and gives It to anotner.
She can, however, plead fatigue and sit
out the dance with some one if she pre
fers to do so.. But' she'. must not sit
on the stairs or in secluded corners, or
dance more ' than three -or four times
with the same man. or she win be
criticised or gossiped about. When a
man asks her. for a dance she "should
reply, .'-With. pleasure," or "Yea, I shall
'be delighted," or. something of that sort,
or it 'is" permissible to say. "Thank you
very much*, but 1 am really too tired to
dance this number."
It is etiquette for the masculine guest
to ask his hostess for at least one dance,
if She -is a .young .woman: if not. be
must ask her daUKhter, niece, or what
ever young sirl the bait Is given for.
He must claim euch partner Immediately
the music begins, and conduct her to a
. seat- when the dance. is oki. ana beg to
be excused when 'he leaves 'her. . -Â»=.
; For all dances, whether ceremonious
balls or the most informal of evening ,
parties, the etiquette for the \u25a0 guests .
is the same, except that at the smaller
affairs the hostess la considered a suffi
cient chaperon for all her young guest*These Are

PARIS, Oct. 7.â Your correspondent had
the opportunity of talking with the Maha
rajah of Tikari and Wyndham Sorel. the
two occupant? "of the winning automobile.
I a forty horsepower, in the contest for the
; Coupe dcs Pyrenees. The Maharajah of
Tikari id one of the most enthusiastic
automobilists among the Indian Princes,
i and for years he has fostered the Impor
tation of machines into that country. .He *
; has possessed all kinds of machines and
enjoys the delights of fast traveling. HÂ«
; said:
; "I came to Europe to see about obtain-
I ing some good machines and to complete
my education as an automobilist. I love
automoblllng as a sport, and clearly see
what a part It may play in the develop
ment of India. I shall take buck with in
several machines, among - others one' of
forty horsepowerâ a sister machine, in
fact, , to that we' have been "using in the
nice for the Coupe -dcs i Pyrenees. With
i these 1 hope'to take part in the reliability _
trials at Calcutta next year, and in any
other automobile contests whleh'may be
held' before'' that." .-,

V/'l'araalio/ taking back with me a small .
autoboat * for - shooting \u25a0 , purposes, but I
must confess that" I do not see much op
portunity fcr the use of the autoboat in
India or along- the _coast. Most of-. the
rivers are too shallow In the dry season
to make boating possible.^ and along the
toast and :n the harbor* the water is
generally ; too choppy for the utilization of
small craft." .
Mr. , Sorel. who . held the steering
wheel of the winning machine inuhe '
Pyrenees contest, -, and who, according
to those who followed that event, drove
with . rare nerve . and skill, combined .with
prudence, tcld me that he came a few
months ago : fTTOi . India, where he 13
interested in advancing the automobile
industry. He said :
HEADWAYS IXCOMPLETE.
"My experience .of automobiling in ,
India leads me to believe that for prac
tical, touring purposes "a sixteen-horse
powcr macnine is the lowest power
to be thought of. Although automo
bilism Is tending to improve the con
dition of the roads, .especially in those
parts where the native chiefs are In
terested in the_ sport, ; there' are still
many , difficulties to be encountered in
the way of .unbridged rivers and steep
ascents. In : most, part now, however,
help" ls^ Immediately-, forthcoming -If a
machine has, to be taken across'a river
or pulled out of a- dlmcult situation.
Thfr question of petroleum is one which
gives 'some inconvenience, as It .can
only be carried , on .* special 'oil* trains,
which leave the principal. centers onca
a week. . ..
.. "Automobilists are perhaps as much '
indebted, to the Maharajah of Gwallor '
as to . any other \u25a0 man : in India â¢ for his
support : of - the sport. He - has recog
\u25a1ized not only the sporting. side of the
question, , but ; the useful aspect as well,
and has supplied many of the officials
and -agents on his estates with ma
chines, so " that they may get about ;.
quickly from" point Ho point. There is
also a strong - feeling \u25a0 among military
man . that if on some of , the . station^ â¢
the . officials 'and leading - . authorities l
were supplied ..with -automobiles "much
good work could be done which 'is now
left undone." % . '.

in the costumes recently purchased ..for- it*.
These are. beautiful in design and decid
edly attractive. The work of the team in
the adoption of. palefaces was yery cred
itable aud during the evening, under good
of the order, several visitors had some
thing to say in- commendation of the ap
pearance of the team. One of the speak
ers, , Dr. Charles MarceHus Troppmann,
the. "father." of. the council,, delivered a
humorous address that, kept the members
and visitors in a roar of laughter for a
quarter of an hour. The doctor has al
ways been looked upon as one: of .the
most "sober-sided" speakers along fra
ternal lines, eloquent at that, but his
breaking out into the humorous caused a
number to exclaim "How could you, doc
tor?", On the evening of October 6 the
council held a special .session in the
assembly hail of the Red Men's building
for the purpose of conferring the degree
on a claes of palefaces. A'number of the
great chiefs were in attendance." '
The dancing party given by Altahmos

cessful affair. Between dances there were
a number of .pleasing numbers, musical
and litetary. ?The social committee; un
der the leadership of Miss : L. Gallegos,
worked with a will to make. this affair an
eajoyable one. The parties-given by this
council are becoming exceedingly popular.
Altahmos Tribe, Improved Order of Red
Men, at its meeting on September,' 27, ' had
up, as special business, the consideration

the following clause relative to* member

â¢ ness, of the visit had ' beÂ«n passed tho
j grand president' addressed the meeting.
, complimenting the 'parlor' upon its good
work, . its magnificent banners, Its faith
ful scretary and' competent deputy, Miss
Rfddell. She informed the parlor that
the grand parlor : no longer' stands for*
the loss of subordinate parlor" property.
1 but that each parlor must Insure such
! property. She spoke of the good that
the Caminetti benefit fund has done and
I Is still doing, and said If the order had
never done anything else It * should be
praised for the Introduction of that fea
ture. The officer reported that the order
Is in a flourishing condition; that thÂ« par
lors â¢ in* the northern part of the StatÂ»
are "particularly active and that Tvorlc
along civic lines should be taken up by
all parlors. She discussed the age limit.
las presented . by her , able predecessor.
Mrs.' Caminetti. and urged all members
of the order not to abbreviate the name
of the State, but to always write it .out.
In full, as that is a most effective way of
advertising the. State.
. Keith Parlor celebrated Flag day with
appropriate exercises at Its first meeting:
in the current month. " ' The . programme
Included' the .singing of. "America." reci
tation: of the flag charge, by. Miss Bosqo.
president. of the parlor; recitation by Dis
trict Deputy Grand President Mlss L> M.
Rlddell. the singing of "My XatlvÂ© Land*/
and a prayer, also an eloquent address!
by Past Grand President Miss Eliza i>.
Keith. This officer in her address called
attention to the . fact ' that the idea of
Flag day dates back to the session held
in Woodland, when. Grand Secretary
Laura J. Frake's, then a 'delegate from
Amapola Parlor. Introduced a resolution
for the observation of Flag day by the
Native Daughters, but at that time the
resolution was not acted upon. At an
other session the idea was adopted, un
der other auspices. The speaker referred
with emphasis . to ' the appropriateness of
the American flag being displayed in. the
meeting places of the Native Daughters,
as it is one method of teaching 'patriot-
Ism and loyalty to country.

Mr. Charles "Waldron does not ap
prove of interviews, Ibsen nor the role
Of David Rossi ("The Eternal City"), in .
which he appears to such advantage j
this week at the Alcazar. He has no
idols of the stage, not even â very pal
pably â himself. He is not in love with
his lilt, simply regarding It as "possibly
the best thing he can do." He thinks,
further, that "the things we do don't
amount to anything." Yet for "the
thing: that is," "everything," God, he has
the worship of the devotee. In fact, Mr.
\u25a0Waldron is much of the mystic, much
of the ascetic that he suggests in his
atmospherical portrait of Rossi. He is
many other things, as he was surprised
into telling me over a cigarette the
other morning.
It was in Mr. Butler's little office that .
we talked. Mr. Waldron's slim, tall ng- j
ure and clean-cut face backgrounded by ,
sn incongruous American safe. Not for ;
a while did the background discover its
incongruity. In fact, in a smart brown
suit seen through a haze of cigarette
smoke, the actor looked like any other
good American. And he was going
swimming and looked as if he had been
before. It was not until we . began to
talk of idols that the yellow robe and
turban of the Oriental mystic began to
glimmer into a fantastic consciousness.
1 had setn something of the sort In the
tctor's Rossi, and wondered just what
it meant, wondered first if it were the
yocialistic ideal at which, the player
knelt, the socialistic ideal that Rossi
upholds. And I meant to find out when
I interviewed Mr. Waldron.
I think Mr. Waldron meant that I
should not! At any rate the actor was
distinctly monosyllabic at first in his
replies to my questions. He was not
fluent throughout â it is not in the. small
change of thought that he deals.
This way things ran tt first. From
"Mr. Waldron: "Interviews are some
thing I don't approve of.'
"I may not, also," the interviewer
vjggested. "But" â here I shrug my
shoulders. Mr. Waldron's large eyes re
gard me with unimpaired seriousness.
"Perhaps," I continue hopefully, "you
/vill tell me about your father; he used
k"> be one cf the lights of the local
"Yes," said Mr. Waldron.
"He was a Californian?"
"No â but resident here."
"Things must have changed here since
hiÂ£ day"â l suggest.
"They must. That is twenty-five years
ago."
Desperately 1 switched: "Don't you like
your part very well, the Rossi? It seem?"
to suit you admirably."
i had said so, with unusual enthusiasm,
in The Call of that morning.
"I don't like the part," Mr. Waldron
replied. He asked then: "Hay I smoke
a cigar*: Ite ?"
I took chances on its reducing- him to
complete wordlessness and said: "Oh,
pray do. â¢ â¢ â¢ You don't like the part
tben " I continued. "I thought you did,
you play it so well. You like the play?" ,
"N'i." said Mr. Waldron, leisurely puf
Â£ns.. - : - , . "\u25a0
"Why? 11 I asked.
I waited several bars. At length the
actor decided: "The thing is theatric,
unreal, tricky."
"What role do you like best?" was my
next attempt.
"Sidney Carton, in 'The Only Way/ "
Mr. Waldron gave me.
I ventured: "Why?"
"It givtÂ« you opportunity to paint a pic
ture." he put it.
I UaA not Mr. Waldron's combination
evidently, any more than that of Mr. But

pansive fashion he ended this with: "I've

I asked: "Arf you tremendously fond
"No." maio Mr. Waldron coolly..
"Why act. then?"
lie volunteered: "I act because I
imapino I can set better than I can do
anything else. I almost gave it up this
sumnif r."
"But why?"
"It is so unreal." the actor said: "I get
<s:sg-uste<J with it. I enjoy acting while
1 am in the tVater. It is when I get
outbid* 1 of thÂ«? theater and thir.k of It â "
'â¢It is possibly a? important as any
<->ther of the make-bflieve," I suggested
hurrirdly.
Mr. Waldron looked through a smoky
hi>}n to ray: "Yes. the things we do
don't nmount to much." .
\'Sm that why you don't like to be inter
view #Â».1?" I asked.
"Potsibly." the actor said, "so few
things are worth talking about."
"Yet, ' I argued, "isn't it in the very
nwuro of an actor to like publicity;
<JoÂ«>rn't the very fact of him setting him

hankering after It?"
The actor thought not. Personally, he

THE PAINTER AND THE FAULTY FIGURE
While tb* great French artist Chart
ran was visiting in New York a few
months ago. he received commissions to
p*int the portraits of many smart wo
men popularly accredited with' beauty.
In the course of his work he found it
* necessary to employ a number of mod
els, whereat he said things â and not
nice things â about the forms of Ameri
can women and their deterioration from
the ideal.
\u25a0 Coming from a man like Chartran,
the verdict deserves looking Into, par
ticularly as the _ American girl â the
clothed American 'girl â is at this time
glorified abroad as welt as at home,
*!ven to the point of English women
adopting American forms of gymnastics
to acquire the figures and carriage of
the American girl.
But all this '"adulation is irrelevant
and immaterial, since it Is not expert
opinion." Besides, the artist has the ad
vantage of intimate knowledge, and the
dressmaker availeth not with her' arts
and crafts.
Pads for the thin and. restraining
straps for the fat have short shrift In
Uie studio, and therefore it Is lnterest
k l .ng â this arraignment of the American
Ts"male figure by Chartran..
He says: "Your women appear to
have an Inadequate development of the
shoulders and an over-development; of
the hips. Their legs are also too; short
In proportion to their bodies and their
head* are too. large. . The bust is often
only do the work as a grocer does. his.
But there is no privacy. in this business.
The public thinks it has the right to
know everything about us, even to what
we eat."
Some do not mind their knowing, 1
added, and again contended that the ac
tor's act is incomparably more intimate,
conscious in its appeal to the public than
any oth^r.
Mr. Waldron did not liKe It that way.
In hJs opinion "an artist is not thinking
less of public opinion when he paints a
picture than an actor wnen ' he makes
Mr. Waldron's big, slim, sharply-shoul
dered body leaned forward to this: "The
trouble is that the actor lias to use him
self for paints and canvas. He is his
own and only medium and helplessly in
evidence when he must express himself."
We left It at that, and it was in speak
ing of Edwin Arden, with whom tho actor
was ..ere at the Grand Opera-house three
or four years ago, that the talk turned
upon idols. As "one of the greatest
American actors" Mr. Waldron classed
Arden.
Carelessly I asked: "And who are your
idols?" iv, *
"I have no idols." the actor said.
It was the something mystic, aloof, re
mote thai came into the large, clear eye?
before me that invited my, "What, none!
You have no Idcls? You worship noth
ing?" '..- : ;:V
The man before mo hesitated, then said
simply: "Yesâ eomething. You wouldn't
understand. I have no words."
I waited.
"It is â everything," he said very s-low
ly, filling in with a mute, helpless ges
ture.
"The thing that is?" I tried to shape it
for him and for myself.. .
"Yes, the thirg that is," >ie repeated,
and accepted.
And about the "thing tha-t is" we
talked awhile.
Mr. Waldron's philosophy does not be
long here, but I knew whence the glint
in Rossi's eye had come when he ended.
"I cannot make out why you are act
ing." was my comment at the closeâ or
why you are doing anything but voicing
some new faith. I added to myself.
"Perhaps I shall not long be acting,"
the player said. "1 have wanted to
write, but I have not the words, nor do
1 think my thoughts of sufficient value
to interest others."
"Shouldn't acting make you ready with
the word?" I asked. ,
"Other people's words," Mr. Waldron
elucidated.
As I went out of the little office the ac
tor followed me with, "I have talked a
lot; didn't mean to say so much; don't
let me."
And I haven't.
WHAT fuA f LOCAL
. THEATERS OFFER
As an American girl who has "made
good" in London to an exceptional de
.srec. as an actress who made her first
appearance In San Francisco, as the
daughter of Madge Carr Cooke, the en
gagement of Eleanor Robson at the Co
lumbia Theater this week is possessed
of unusual interest for local playgoers,.
Also, Miss Robson brings with her Israel
Zangwill's successful play, "Merely Mary
Ann," that seems to be of unusual at
tractiveness. And further, the actress
will give here for the first time Brown
: ing's play, "In a Balcony."
The performance of "In a Balcony"
will be given on Thursday afternoon next
and will begin at 3 o'clock sharp. No
one will be seated after the rise of the
curtain, it is announced. Miss Robson
first played the role of Constance some
three years ago, in conjunction with Otis
Skinner and Mrs. Le Moyne as Norbcrt
and the Queen, winning large commenda
tion for her work. The production is
attracting much attention.
The Alcazar offers the perennially en
gaging farce "What Happened to Jones"
this week, in which Miss Leonora Kirwln,
the Alcazar's new ingenue, will make
her first appearance.
This afternoon and evening the very
good production of "The Eternal City"
will be seen for the last time.
â¢ â¢ â¢
At this afternoon's matinee the Grand
Opera-house will present the lively musi
cal comedy by George Ade, "The Sultan
of Sulu." The comedy has not been given
here before at the popular-priced houses.
â¢ â¢ â¢
At the Majestic Barney Bernard will
be seen Jn "Humbugs." the Roland Reed
comedy, for his last week with the Bishop
players. Lillian O'Neill will, play the.
companion humbpg.
Harry W. Bishop's offer â¢' to produce
some time this season the best Califor
nian pay submitted to him has created
no little stir among the local drama
tists.
â¢ â¢ â¢
â¢Devere's Own Burlesque Company is
to be the attraction at the California this
week. They will give "The Health Re
sort" and "The/ Miffiffif." Sam Devere
is the one-time famous light of Bush
street minstrelsy, being "of the Billy \u25a0
Emerson crowd.

Tuesday evening and Saturday afternoon.

It Is hereby warmly recommended that
Mr. I^eahy reduce his light bill, so far as
the -double -.r0w ..0f incandescents around

BOHEMIAN MUSIC
v - HIGHLY PRAISED
'The Musical Courier 'of September Z<>
contains an Important article of- Interest
to us in the very, enthusiastic account
by Mr. Elumenberg . of the. Bohemian
Club jinks . music. -Very' rightly Mr.
Blumenberg recognizes the high office
of the -Bohemian Club in-the encourage
ment of the best in music... Very right
ly he recosrniSrrEthe almost uniaue op
portunity, the flub ffestivais affordâ
more particularly since the foundation
of ? the public jinksâ to tho â¢ local mu
sician. Not -in America. Mr. Blumen
'bcrsj.say's. is there an institution of like
kind, viz; one riven over, pure and sirn
plei 10 the encouragement of the Ameri-
: â¢.â¢an /'composer/ /He gives' sympathetic
"account of ; the last": jinks' concert /and
sympatht-tic consideration to tho" future
â¢possibilities* of Hhe jinks./ Incidentally
Mr./ Blaninnbcrpr " ' comments upon '. : the

distinctly sympathetic view throughout
\u25a0^which.the editor of the Musical Courier
itakt>s of us.":. '......-.. v \u25a0 -
"After -protesting generally, about the
conditions' that confront*, the American
i-omposer, Mr. : Dlumenbers has this to
say of San, Friucisco:
"This concert (the jinks concert) in San*
Francisco ,is /the one luminous Instance
that proves ' that work can be. accom
plished if the proper spirit ushers It
before the public,, and that, if. the In
gredients are found, the resulting mater
ial, can be evolved. The concert at the
Tivoirtn .this city to .which I refer, at
which -an orchestra of. fifty- flye per
formed the. composition of resident Amer
ican composers, was given under the aus
pices of an institution which Is the most
unique In the., Western Hemisphere;, and
I doubt, after havins been in the most
of the cities of Europe*, whether there is
any similar aggregation of spirits and
souls that are willing and anxious to do
what ; this" Institution has accomplished
and 'is accomplishing.
,"I refer to the" Bohemian Club, which
was the motive power through which this
performance took - place. â¢ \u25a0 â¢\u25a0 â¢
"The Bohemian Club of San Francisco,
as far as. l can see. la. Just the same as
any "other -club- Ini its .construction. It 3
physical . basis Is a clubhouse with Its
i appurtenances, but the, moral and- mental
i tone of this club have developed In the
direction of art and literature. and music.
It. has within" lts fold a la^e number of
kindred spirits living out -here on the
edge of civilization, ' who have felt that
for - this fact alone it became necessary ,
for them, to remain In contact with this
civilization;' and this pressure, this appe
tite,-this desire, have evolved into a gen
eral demand for the best Â£ hat art can
possibly' give.
"To such an extent la the fraternal
spirit manifesting Itself that the members
vie with one another for mutual elevation.
All eavillnz. all envy and jealousy are
ezlled and the whole club Is enzazed In
a monumental and momentous - effort to
exert an artistic Influence, not alone over
ther ; community of San Francisco, but
throuehout the whole coast J*
; As to the concert, Mr. Blumenbers
says: J \u25a0 .- '
,"I do not function as a critic and shall
hot view these works from the rigid point
of view of technical criticism. :â¢ â¢ â¢
This is not the time for such criticism.
The .question is whether under proper
auspicesâ whether when the Bohemian
Club .succeeds In establishing Us own
permanent orchestra (for It will be the
j Bohemian Club that t/UI accomplish this*
I for California and the coast>. and when
the Bohemian Club has reached that
strength which will enable it to maintain
its own large orchestra for It 3 own pur
posesâwhether then these composltion.i
will have, justice done to them and
whether they are worthy of production
on ; the general broad basis Of musical
worth and Impressionism. It must be
concluded that these composers In San
Francisco, having written works of such
Importance as demonstrated by this con
cert, an opportunity should be* given to
them to be heard under the proper aus
pices."

. Said a transport officer to me re
cently:- "Eighty-five per. cent of all
army officers beneath the rank of col
onel arc swamped in debt, and in the
case'fof men with families the faultis
not wholly their own, their social and
official obligations being toe heavy for
their salaries." i
Since San Francisco has earned . the
sobriquet of "mother-in-law to the
army," the statement of the transport
officer (who is in a position to know
what he's talking about) is interesting.
Continuing, he referred to General
Corbins oft expressed views on the in
expediency of matrimony in the service,
and to his most recent declaration that
?n army officer should live the only
life open to him on his present salary â
the simple life- And not for any de-
Eire to follow a new cult, but for the
prosaic purpose of preserving his honor
and the honor of the service.
Now, this proclamation bears all the
evidences of a mature mind, and all
of its inconsistencies â General Corbin, I
like a lot of other good old men having j
long ago shed the halo of romance that I
colors the judgment of the young.
But he is right â undeniably right â in
his assertion that the army officer should
live within his means. That's an economic
law that applies alike to all men.
But can an jofficer do so on his pres
ent pay. with the \u25a0 social obligations
that his position entails upon him, ana/
the extensive wardrobe and equipment
demanded of him by army regulations?
And herein â¢is not mentioned the main
tenance of his wife and children..
It is one of the singular bits of Con
gressional wisdom that the pay stand
ards of the army, arranged thirty-three
years ago. have never been altered, in
epite of the fact that the cost of living
has greatly increased and that social
life in and out of the army has grown
much more complex and proportionate
ly more expensive.
Therefore, Instead of forcing young
officers â who from the standards of
manliness, education, culture and so
cial position make desirable hus
bandsâinto chronic bachelorhood, or if
wedded, into living lives of social soli
tude and ostracism at the post â let a
concerted action be taken to force
Congress to raise the pay of its officers
as their necessities demand.
As the matter stands now, the ' only
officers who can wed â and hope lo keep
out of the money-brokers' handsâ are
those who possess a private income,
or who wed a maid with an income.
And such a condition is a disgrace to
the nation and" a menace* to" the army"
Instead of preaching the. "simple life,"
which must mean calico, a cottage and
a cabbage patch for the officers* wo
men, let General Corbin turn his in
fluence toward raising the soldier's payâ
and then we shall have a lot of pretty
weddings in town.
I know some awfully nice chaps out
at the post who are sighing to wed If
Congress would only adopt a more pro
pitious scale of wages.
And I know some awfully nice girls
too. who would be made very, very
happy. f

Protests Asnlnst Speed Ordinance.
S. J. Thiesen yseterday filed a pro
test against the proposed ordinance to
limit the speed of streetcars permitting
a speed of fifteen miles ah hour' on Mis
sion street, between Eighteenth and
Thirtieth, on the ground that such a
speed would be dangerous and unrea
sonable. Thiesen cites as proof of his
contention the recent fatal accidents on
the streetcar lines. He suggests that
the speed should be limited to eight
.miles an hour at street crossings, in
blocks where there is a public school,
library, church, assembly hall or the
ater and when one car passes a stand
ing car. Thiesen further suggests that
the ordinance contain a provieion
requiring the street railway .companies
to render statements of all accidents
causing personal injuries upon their
systems. .

Secret .Ser^ce Agent Helms has '.re
ferred the letter and the investigation to
the secret service office. at Seattle.- . ' \u25a0
The first determined opposition encoun
tered by Ajrent Helms in his work.of run
ning the naturalisiation perjurers to earth
was experienced a few-days : ago, when
Eric Kokeritz, master of the -Americari
ship Star of France, appeared at the office
in obedience to.a summons from' Agent
Helms: \u25a0 Kokeritz allowed .the secret ser
vice man to. inspect- his .papers^ but re-;
fused to take an oath or make any state
ment whatever: He said'thathe ; had "en
gaged an attorney, and defied Mr. Helms
to find out anything wrong with his nat
uralization or his license. A representa
tive of Kokerltz's attorney .called' upon
Mr.' Helms yesterday and asked' what ar
rangements Helms would offer inj.he way
of having; Kokeritz reinstated to~cillzen
shlp should -he surrender, his papers: and
make a statement. .Helms replied thathe
had no compromise to offer. : . ; ,
In the meantime Agent Helms had as
certained the following facts: On July. 13,
IS9S, Kokeritz deserted from. the IBritlsh
ship Afghanistan in this harbor arid took
a room in a sailor boarding-house at " 6
Howard street. He pas6ed ; himself o'ffas
a well-educated man of aristocratic blood
and Influential connections in -Europe.
the boarding-house people offered
to introduca him, he- being a tenderfoot,
he declined, and gave as a reason that the
other seafaring men were not sufficiently
educated or aristocratic to fraternize with
him. On September 30,. IS9S, two years
after his arrival, he .was naturalized
fraudulently .as . a minor, and shortly
thereafter he swore to an- affidavit before
United States Local Inspectors Bolles and
Bulger when applying for an American
seaman's license that he had served on
the steamship. Alameda . for twelve
months, .the -San Mateo for six monrns
and the Thistle for six months. J Agent
Helms discovered , that Kokeritz had not
served at all on -any of these. vessels and
that his affidavit J before the inspectors
was perjury/ The first American vessel
on which he had served after arriving. in
thÂ« United States was a pilot boat in the
bay of San Francisco, and after that the
steamer Coquille River.
Agent Helms 1 has laid the, foregoing
facts before, the United States local in
spectors and has asked that Kokeritz's li
cense be canceled.

GLIMPSES OF THE UNDERWORLD.
IT has been often suggested that the money and energy now ex
pended upon foreign missions be diverted to an effort at home
to christianize our domestic society and remedy the crying evils
of our own underworld, which presents features more abhorrent
than the darkest paganism. The Salvation Army does some of this
work now. It goes to places which others shun, and no individual
is too far astray to lose its interest or get beyond its influence. Some
have thought, and justifiably, that if all the funds now spent on for-;
eign missions to the heathen were intrusted to General Booth, his
widespread army would do more good with it in nominally Chris
tian countries than it is accomplishing in an effort to convert the
It is accepted as a fact that his army is doing more toward
moral sanitation of the slums of the great cities of the world than
has ever been done by any other means. In London, the greatest
of the cities, where the need is greatest and the task seems the most
hopeless, so much has been accomplished that the Lord Mayor and
councils have publicly honored General Booth by presenting him
with the freedom of the city. Such an honor was never given to
a Bishop or Archbishop of the established church, nor to Spurgeon
cr any of the great nonconformist preachers.
It was offered to the general of the Salvation Army because thp
work he set in motion is in quarters shunned by others. It is
among people who seem so lost that others will not undertake their
recovery. Humanity in them has become so warped, so twisted and
so transfigured by poverty, vice and ignorance as to seem lost en
tirely, leaving nothing to work upon. But the army finds some
thing and often reports a rescue effected by its gospel of "soup,
soap and salvation."
But between the slums and their antithesis, the heights of life,
there is a field that some influence should reach. It is the border
land between the under and the upper world. It is a" land of fear
ful shadows. One looks upon it as upon the social crater, covered
by vapors, and through rifts in the mist are disclosed scenes that
shame humanity. Take the daily news record of any large city and
contemplate the scenes which it discloses. In the happenings of one
week in San Francisco we have enough to horrify humanity and
stimulate effort at reform. A girl gone astray shows a fiend the
hidden hoard of her hard-working father and it is all stolen. She
â¢goes with it into the keeping of a scoundrel, whp finally beats her
a dog and sends her home bruised and ruined.
In a squalid room lies a woman, trying to die by her own hand,
betrayed, robbed and left nude .by a friend who stripped the poor
rags from her back to pawn for money to buy drugs or liquor.
Starving in an unfurnished shelter is a mother and her babies, de
ferted by the wretch who swore to love and cherish her. Wander
ing sinfully are the daughters of a widow, their feet in the path
that takes hold on hell. Multiply these by as many cities as are in
Christendom and by the thousands who people them, and the
glimpses of the underworld and its borderland are calculated to dis
turb the peacefulness of sleep. Are there no means of amelioration?
Does civilization give it up as a hopeless task? Does modern social
science surrender to a situation it cannot control? Greatest of all,
does the Christian world confess to evils in its body for which there
is no medicine?
The difficulty of it is that many of these writhing victims seen
in the rift have known better. The poor girl trying to taste death
by her own agency cries out to her father, "I reckon those who do
wrong must take punishment." The one who disclosed her father's
store to the thief who was her companion returns thankfully to the
forgiveness of her parents. They offer the only example that cheers
in the sad chapter of sin. They take back the prodigal daughter,
forgetting and forgiving the loss of their substance and of her honor.
A newspaper man sees the seamy side of life. He may some
times become a cynic or a pessimist, but usually he is put upon in
quiry. Why is all of this sin and misery in a world where all might
be upright and happy? Is there no remedy, no avoidance of snare
and pitfall? One thing is sure. Instead of discussing so much the
lost state of those we call heathen, let us consider our own. There
is a mission at home. It calls for moral heroes and for Inoney. The
Salvation Army has pioneered in that dark country where dirt is the
physical condition and sin is the rule of conduct.
They may go there 'tomtoming and blowing horns, but they go
to fearlessly touch moral pitch and are not defiled. Shall their
ways be imitated by others, or shall they hold the field and be en
dowed with substance to carry on the work? There is the place
for money, even tainted money, not acceptable for the conversion
of the heathen. Any money, even the hire of sin, is cleansed by its
devotion to a cause that cries for help. It is useless to say that these
evils have always been. They have been in kind, but never in such
degree as now. :W, ft
THE STATE GRANGE.
TIME was that the Grange was used to furnish amusement to
newspaper readers and smart paragraphers worked it inces
santly. But that time is long gone by. The Grange was the
first means used in this country for getting the rural people to
gether. Its ritual furnished only the means of protecting its mem
bership against interlopers, and its confidential work goes no fur
ther. In adopting in its nomenclature classical figures, such as
Ceres and Pomona, it harked back to the time when the ancients
valued at their true worth the tillers of the soil, and the soil, itself
was respected as the source of all the sustenance of life and
The Greeks typified the human race in the fable of Antaeus,
who could not be destroyed as long as he was thrown upon the
ground. He rose renewed in_,strength and vigor, and Was only,
overcome when held in the air and not permitted to touch the
earth. In all ages individuals, races and nations have been re
newed when the>- returned to the soil and tilled it. To that agency
must we look in this country for a cure of many besetting evils.
On the farm there is useful and wholesome occupation for the
young. It is not the country that furnishes 95 per cent of juvenile
criminals, but the city. The farmer boys are growing up, wise in
the lore of the land, strong in mental and moral endowments, and
sound in body. They are the real strength and dependence of the
republic.
The awakened interest in the soil and in rural occupations
promises to drain off the city population and to establish a safer
balance between city and country. . Twenty : nine millions of our
people are engaged in gainful occupations. ' Half of that number
are on farms. Only 7,000,000 are employed in manufactures. The
products of the soil in value enormously exceed all the values pro
duced by mining and manufactures. Such an interest may well
have common purposes and seek unity of spirit and action" in an
organization like the Grange.
The exceeding variety of the agricultural and horticultural in
terests of California results in bringing together in the Grange , a
greater number of people skilled in a variety of rural industries
than can be gathered in any other State in the Union. Tom Mar
shali of Kentucky began a tariff speech in Congress -by savins*-:
*'Mr. Speaker, if I were a fanner and you were a farmer, ami' we \u25a0
were neighbors, and I raised potatoes and nothing but potatoes, and
you raised potatoes and nothing but potatoes, then, sir, yon would
have nothing to exchange with me for my potatoes but your po
tatoes." That represents conditions in a country where fixed--' phy
sical features limit agricultural production. But in'- California there
is no such narrow, limitation. Our products arc in greater variciv'

KISSING IS HEALTHY.

So much the better, says this amiable

bacilli is a laudable and healthful prac
tice. In kissing it is not so much the
bad microbes as the beneficient ones that
are exchanged. These goud bacteria, as
Is well known, are not only favorable
but essential to digestion. If we were to

SWEEP OUT
YOUR BRAIN
The Only Way to Cultivate Cheer
Is to Give Your MM a
Cheery Place to Dwell
ANGELA MORGAN
( C AM I making an attic of my
/\ mind's chamber?" Ask your
/Â» S elf the question, fox upon the
answer depends your health, yotir hap
piness, ycur success in this life.
It is amazing, when we stop to con
sider the matter, how utterly thought.
Uss and negligent we are in caring f or
this upper room where our mind has its
quarters.
Literally we treat this room as m any
people treat their attics, storing It wjtix
the things wÂ© do not want, yet hayÂ» not
the courage to discard. Piling It with
rubbish and cumbering it with ca3:-02,
worthless mental possessions.
Now, the mind's chamber, above every
other chamber in our soul's habitation,
should be kept scrupulously clean, a^
absolutely free from the things wÂ£*%
not want. It is the room of all roomj
where we should store the things we do
wantâ the things that are beautiful,
helpful, invigorating and inspiring. The
things we would feast our thoughts upon.
the things that make for health, for re
freshment, for harmony, for success.
Yet think what slothful, ignorant
housekeepersâ mind keepersâ we have
been! How could we expect our mind tn
be contented and happy and healthy la
such uuarters?
We certainly would not expect a mem
ber of our household to be contented la
a room cluttered with old furniture and
hung with cobwebs. We would not in
sult a guest by giving him a room heaped
with rubbish and unsightly things.
Yet this is just the insult we offer oar
mindâ the ruler of our Individual world
when we expect it to abide uncomplain
ingly in a garret filled with trash and
dingy for lack of daylight.
Then we wonder why we have the
blues and why sometimes life seems an
utter failure. We are impatient because
we cannot all at once train ourselves to
be permanently cheerful. How can we
when we give our mind such untidy, un
wholesome surroundings? When we fur
nish such unsightly things for It to look
upon?
What are these unsightly things? Why,
the sad memories, the heavy regrets, tha
doubts, the fears, the grudges, complaints
and superstitions we cherish. You don't
cherish them, you say. Are you su-o?
Not any of them?
Stop and consider. You have no yultje
ânot the slightestâ against any one?-Pr<ja
are not carrying a bitter memory? Tou
harbor no regrets? No doubts, fears, no
bogles of the imagination?
If this Is so. you are a happy person,
indeed. And you must be a healthy per
son, too. I congratulate you.
If it is not so; if you are conscious,
upon reflection, that you do harbor some
of these undesirable and ought-to-be-dis
carded mental furnishings, then determine
to go to house-cleaning at once.
The only way to cultivate cheer so it
will stay by you is to give your mind a
cheery, beautiful place to dwelL
Rid that upper chamber of everything
th3t the mind doe 3 not enjoy. Go sys
tematically to work and clean out the
rubbish. First, fling open the shutters
and let In the sunlight. Now you can
see, can't you, just what a disreputable
lot of thoughts you have been storing?
The sunlight shows them up In their
true guise. Just look at them! How
could you ever have convinced yourself
It was right to keep them on hand?
Oh. the dismal, wretched heap! The "I
cants," "I fears." "I'll get evens" and
the "I*ll never forgets."
Sweep them out, every one! Brush
down the cobwebs. Clear away the dust.
Perhaps it will take time. But don't be
discouraged. Go at the cleaning process
gradually, just as though you were clear
ing out a room in your house.
One day get rid of a grudge. Another
day sweep away a fear. Next day fling
away a superstition. Then cast out a
doubt: next, a bad memory. Keep on un
til your mind's chamber is clean.
Then be careful how you refurnisfcffi-
Don't let anything remain there that you
don't want. Keep watch. Hang In it only
such pictures as will gladden and
strengthen your mind.
Be sure your mind will rejoice In the
change. Be sure it will reward you by
giving you moods of Joy and contentment.
Good-by forever to the "blues" after
you have thus swept and refurnished your
mind's chamber.
GROWING EGYPTIAN COOT.
To the Editor of The Call:
A few days ago I wrote to the president
of the State Board of Agriculture and to
the director of the agricultural experi
ment station on the possibility of \u25a0 intro
ducing Egyptian cotton into California
and growing It on a commercial scale.
The reply I received from the experiment
station affirmed the suitability of the soil
and climate of several counties of the
State.
Egyptian cotton commands tfcÂ» highest
price on the market because of its silky.
yellowish long fibers. Indeed cotton is
not only profltfble to the growers of
Egypt, but is the most essential crop
on which the wealth and prosperity of
that country depend.
What would it mean In introducing such
a staple and growing it by the skillful
farmer of Egypt? It means that several
thousands of acres uncultivated could *oe
turned Into the richest cotton flalÂ£**Â«r .1
the world and thus creating a new to
dustry In the State much more profitable
than even gold mining or orange grow
ing; causing the establishment of mills
and factories, thus employing thÂ« Id's
and shortly adding to this beautiful Stats
much more wealth.
Such a project cannot succeed unless
the dally press of the metropolis takes it
in hand and discusses it thoroughly. !*\u25a0
ia also essential that the agricultural au
thorities of the State investigate the nat
ter fully and report to tho public before
any organizatloa.be formed to undertaka
the enterprise. "GEORGE J. SALEM.

J. N. LARNED is a name which, placed
as author upon the title page of a his
torical work, is an eloquent guarantee
of its excellence. "Larned's History for
Ready Reference" has made itself so
widely known, and so favorably known,
that the link thus made between the word
learned and the word history is one of
the distinctest aids that the association
of ideas gives to memory. When you
wish to swiftly find some suddenly need
ed facts of history, reliably, briefly,
luminously stated, â¢ you look in Lamed
and are at once enlightened. When you
ask the highly trained librarians some
queries of history they Know no answer
for. tiny send you to "Lamed" with
brief word and bold assurance, and con
sider their conscience fully acquit by
ihus riehverin? you to the replies of
him of the "History of Ready Refer
ence." That work is a -wonder of con
densation, and is at once encyclopaedic
in character and capable of interesting
when its pages are read as a continuous
narrative.
So when you' learn that this author has
written In two volumes a history called
"Seventy Centuries of the Life of Man
kind,"' and that this work is an evolu
tion from the former famous one, you
can safely trust that this marshaling of
the all-important features of world-his
tory has been masterfully done.
Lamed -was himself long connected
with an important public library, and he
thus became experienced in the art of
formulating so as to be quickly located
the facts that the big reading public
most frequently wanted to know. The
two trainings, that of librarian planning
and *nat of scholarly research in history,
conjoining In him maxe a combination
hard to surpass for the performance of
the task he s*-t himself in the "Seventy
Centuries." namely, the arrangement in
continuous narrative of the things best
worth knowing in universal history, and
yet so thoroughly systematized that the
one item imperatively needed at a par
ticular time is never confusedly lost in
The great mass of knowledge.
What this expert considers the essen
tials of history are in this work con
densed in less than a thousand pages.
Its secondary title is: "A survey of his
tory from the earliest known records,
through all stages of civilization, in all
Important countries, down to the present
time." It has an introductory account
of prehistoric peoples. It is illustrated
with about a hundred and fifty reproduc
tions of famous historical paintings and
portrr-its in black and white and colors.
While the great events are narrated in
their regular order of occurrence, if any
particular subject is selected for study
it may be singled out and read exclusive
of the others by reference to the index,
which is synthesized on every important
branch of history and made very full.
The two main divisions are ancient
and medieval in the first volume, and
modern in the second. All the seventy
centuries he divides into six great
epochs, as follows: Epoch of the earli
est civilizations and known empires;
epoch of the Greeks and Romans;
epoch of the new nations, known as the
middle ages; epoch of modernizing ex
pansions, called the renaissance; epoch
of political revolutions, and epoch of
bcience, mechanism, democracy and the
transforming of the world.
One of the most Interesting plans
of the work is the prefacing of the
history of -each â¢Â«f -these six great
epochs with brief character sketches
<'f the chief personage* concerned in
making those epochs memorable. This
is like a reeondensation of a conden
sation. It makes a superlatively se
lective, swift survey of the world's
great ones and most important events.
This part- of it is especially literarily
well 'done, and therein Lamed makes
us awar? of his command of styles, as
If he had lavished much labor in the
pruning away of a profusion of crop
ping-up, suggested sentences â to leave
only a few elect as most absolutely
necessary to make the briefest char
acterizing strokes. Most of these
character sketches are accompanied
by portraits of the noted persons de
scribed.
Although the volumes are planned to
make the glimpse of the seventy cen
turies show In most perfect perspective,
the history was writen for Americans,
and our country is for this reason
given a little more prominence than
a strictly world perspective would con
strict it to.
In his preface Lamed Informs us of
the ideal of historic accomplishment
he set out to perform. He succeeded
wonderfully in fulfilling what his will
had designed. He tells us:
"The proper abridgment of a nar
rative of history is neither a procesb
of desiccation, nor one of crushing and ,
packing, but a work of discriminating
\u25a0fttlection and luminous arrangement,
applied to Its most significant incidents
and larger facts. This is sometimes
made the "sceans of bringing the promi
nences of history into Impressive re
lief, opening large views In it that
might be narrowed or obscured by
much amplification of detail."
Lamed made a study of many books
most notable for this sort of pregnant
brevity, which he 6ays appeals to his
admiration and Judgment of value in
historical work; he has given much
thought to that method and its
principles, and In his present un
dertaking he has attempted the larg
est possible application of them "in
a comprehensive survey of the whole
of human history, from its dawn to the
present day." The volumes, examined
by the reader at almost any passage
â¢chosen at random, will impress the
thought that the author is skillfully
executing what he had thus so wisely
planned.
The vast extent of history stretches
from Mena, to whom belongs . the
unique distinction of being the first ;
man to be named by history, down to i
our own modern science man, Marconi, '
of the wireless fame. At the very be
ginning we are told of the author of
the first book known to have been
writtenâ the oldest book In the world.
It is a book of moral precepts. The
author was Ptah-hetcp, and from his
tomb we get a likeness of his features.
He called his book "Good Sayings," and
they give one who reads them "the
feeling of being Introduced to the
primitive archetype of all gentlemen.
They outline a standard of right con
duct which was set before men thou
sands of years before Athens had risen,
â¢ \u2666 ""â¢ and the standard set is very
high." "It will fit no life that is not
lifted above petty things, where the
mind becomes tolerant and the spirit
magnanimous, the temper serene."
Thus do we begin, this record of sev
enty centuries of human life by learn
ing that we have an inheritance of
moral greatness dating back nearly six
thousand years. The history closes with
a brief statement of the remarkable |
experiments for human betterment that I
are being made by practical sociolo
gists in New Zealand, but "Judgments
upon the workings of these experi
ments are not wholly in agreement,
and final conclusions regarding them
are not likely to be drawn for some
years."
Some of the striking features of the
volume covering the modern period are
the account of Louis XI in his subtle
schemes to wrest power from the feu
dal chiefs and so consolidate the au-
thority of the throne of France (he
accomplished it by fraud and treach
ery and clever playing of the power of
one noble against that of another): the
description of the despotism which
Lorenzo de Medici made magnificent by
the greatness of his own genius and
thus charmed Florence while he "stole
away her freedom"; the pen picture
of the dauntless Dominican, Savona
rola, who itold 'the autocratic Prince
who had threatened the priest with
banishment, "Though I am a stranger
in the city, and Lorenzo the first man
in the state, yet I shall stay here, and
it Is he who must go hence." We are
reminded in selection of great world
events that It was this remarkable
priest whft so reformed the dissolute
city of Florence that at his bidding the
people made a great "bonfire of vani
ties," which .was a public holocaust of
"cards, dice, licentious books, face
paints, false, hair and all the parapher
nalia of frivolity and vice."
Others are: The marriage of Mary,
daughter of Charles the Bold, to Maxi
milian when the bridegroom was so
poor the bride had to lend him money
to buy his wedding garments, and yet
from this union sprang two great sov
ereign dynasties, the Austrian and the
Austro-Spanish; the fall of the church
from its' high estate because of the
bad Popes Sixtus IV and Alexander
VI, and the great but irreligious Leo
X, son of Lorenzo de Medici â "loving
ease, pleasure, luxury, art, and care
less of all that belonged to religion
beyond its ceremonies and its comfort
able establishment of clerical estates.
Is it strange that Christendom was
prepared to give ear to Luther?"'
Francis I. he of the famous message
after the battle of Pavia that "All Is
lost but honor," is shown to have made
a tricky, dishonorable promise in or
der to escape from his captivity â he at
the time not intending to keep his
word. Such is fame, and such the un
happy splotch on a famous sentence.
Still we can part the sentence from
its inconsistent originator and make
it serve as a stimulus to ever save
something valuable- out of the wreck
of defeat.
A luridly cruel picture is that of the
Spanish grasping at wealth which
eventually destroyed the power they
thought it would build. Pizarro in Peru
and the theft of the vast ransom of
a room full of gold and murder of the
inca who had been promised life â in
the great peaks of historic perspective
that crime is not overlooked. The
mad search for El Dorado, the golden
city and its gilded king, Is shown as
a strange superstition. The Catholic
reaction, after Luther's temporary vic
tory over them, is well related and the
philosophy of such changes expounded.
The brilliant career of the militantly re
ligious and incomparable obedient and
well organized Jesuits is among the
notables elected to hold In the.conden
sation. Queen Elizabeth's reign gets
much attention.
Larned's love of literature makes him
say the Elizabethan period Is the most
glorious In English history. A swift
glimpse Is given of Japan; and the rea
son why the seeds of Christianity plant
ed there by the great Catholic, Xavier.
failed is shown to be the arrogant in
tolerance of the disciples, who spoiled
every good prospect the priest had
made possible. How France ruined
much of her power by the persecution
of the Huguenots is positively asserted.
Cllve's conquest of India with, only a
thousand British troops is notable. In
fixing the perspective of great literary
men he does things like this â giving
Carlyle a sentence: "Carlyle molds lan
guage into strange and striking, forms
of expression, which 'he uses with, a
power that ia more extraordinary than
the power of the thought conveyed."

SHORT STORIES
BY PHILLFOTTS
Eden Phillpotts, author qf that strong
story, "The Secret Woman," which re
ceived so much praise and is considered
his masterpiece, has just published ten of
his short stories under the title "Knock
at a Venture." The most considerable of
these is one of a hundred pages called
"Mound by the Way." It is; a~ story of
farm and village life on the moors of.
Devon, and the characters talk in dialect.
It is about the passions of love and Jeal
ousy. It Is the pain In three lives that
make a story of the events narrated.
None of these lives is a fine one. The
tragedy to which the love led up seems
to come Inevitably enough to make the
tale read as right art.
The persons of the story are, first, John
Aggett, a big powerful day laborer, who
works Intermittently as a thatcher; sec
ond. Sarah Belworthy, daughter of the
village blacksmith and loved by John
Aggett since they were boy and girl and
playmates on the moor; third, Timothy
Chave, the son of the wealthiest farmer
of the neighborhood. The "mound by the
way" conceals a grave.
Phillpotts, who is good at descriptions
of the environments of scenery amid
which he makes his creatures act, tells us
about a blackthorn which grows up from
this moundâ a deformed and grotesque
tree, much bent and shriveled. Its boughs
had seen a century of. winters and biting
winds. It Is a ruin of a tree, with each
year an increasing concourse of withered
twigs rotting above and below the center,
of vitality. The human dust within the
grave is of one who lived and let his love
overpower him into the commission of
crime more than a hundred years ago.
This sufferer, a strong weakling, if such
an expression is permissible, was John
Aggett, and Phillpotts tells us of -the love
and the mental agony and the 'crime of
this lonjT dead farm laborer with an art
almost as if one should lead you for a
walk far into country ways and then
drawing you aside from the road into the
deep woods point out the old grave
through which the. blackthorn grew, and
as you sit beside It tell the sad cause of
Us being there and why men still bid
their children leave untouched the flower
and fruit of the blackthorn, for "the roots
of it wind in the duet of the unholy dead,
and to gather the fruit or pluck the flow
er would be to beckon. sorrow."
It was beautiful the frank way these
peasant children loved. Delicious seemed
the frank way in which when a few years
later they find themselves freshly grown to
manhood and womanhood they* acknowl T
edge their love -to each other,; and: the
prospect of the eurely coming union, of
strong young man and fair young woman
is ona of. those promises so innocent and
attractive as to make the outside,: on
looking world happy as if half partici
pating In the joy. of the' principal partici
pants. They pledged each other, each to
each, and after, a. day' of harvest toll and
while they loitered and rested out in the
woods. "No artifice the
plump natural J curves of her -waist; her
garments, were thin and the soft body
of her beneath them fired him." "Give
awver!, You'm squeezln' me, Jan!" she
said, and he replied, , "Say ,it thenâ say
it outâ or I'll hug 'c, an', hug 'c and hug
*c to deathfor, sheer , love!" \ ; ,
This happiness was not to last. Timothy
Chave, the son and prospective heir ; of
the . wealthy farmer, came back i. to work
on the home place. ." He is made of finer

one of the main studies of the book, and
the keynote to him. was, "He that will not

V Wlllard had some fine traits in his
makeup, but not enough of the "plus"
element In his love emotions to cause us
to wish he had won either of the charm-,
ing ladies he had admired and befriended.
He; discovered -Cecilia In a. condition *of
poverty and distress, and as she was the
daughter of an old fellow artist he gave
her a good position In his studio to do the
work of private secretary. In the conver
sation in which the above mentioned sen
tence occurs Willard had noticed that
Charlotte's thought "outside the
circumference] of his personality," and he*
waited ; a few moments for her "mental
presence, and not recognizing ; it in the

like dreaming on her face, he spoke a lit

Near the closing of her story the
author imts into the mouth of Char

sire to give those we love happy sur
prises is one of the strongest primi
tive instincts in man and woman kind.
Nothing eradicates it. Culture makes
no difference. Religion none. Those
dear old Greeks noticed that 'destiny
loves surprises,' and the same idea
runs through the Christian faith. God
has not told us what he has prepared
for those he loves â 'eye hath not seen,
ear hath not heard.' "

SMYTH E HANDLES
BIG QUESTIONS
"Constructive Democracy" is the title
of a new book by William E. Smythe,
the irrigation and land reclamation ex
pert. In his "Conquest of Arid America,"
written several years ago, Smythe ad
vanced some ideas about the value of
co-operation for the advancement of man
kind, both as to material welfare and as
to development as mental and moral be
ings, which are' in parts of this new work
again brought forward. The reclamation
of the arid West by means of Irrigation
is held to be the destined means by
which a sort of co-operative, superman
is to be evolved. Some of the best pages
of his book are devoted to enthusiastically
expounding the author's theories upon
this subject.
In his first chapter, which is on "the
principle of constructive progress," he
states that the underlying principle of
such progress is the recognition .of an
Ideal by which the problems of succeed
ing generations may be sounded. He
elucidates this by a. quotation from Lin
coln: "Public. opinion, on any subject, al
ways has a central idea, from which all
its* minor thoughts radiate." The ideal
which seema uppermost In Smythe's
mind is the one of working together in a
sort of altruistic recognition that "I am
my brother's keeper," and much of the
book is frankly socialistic. He says: "It
follows that the nation shall recognize
that its great destiny is to lead the world
toward higher and ever higher forms of
co-operation and to persevere until at
last democracy shall be able to express
Itself in terms of absolute industrial
equality."
jÂ§ Speaking of the proposed regulation of
railroads by the Federal authorities, he |
quotes with approval a statement to the
effect that the fixing of rates would be
a long step in" the direction of Socialism.
\u25a0 The authoi; Is an extremist to the ex
tent that he quotes as motto for his work
the sentence from De Tocquevllle, "the
remedy for the evils of.democracy is more
democracy." His dedication is addressed
to Francis G. Newlands; the father of
the national reclamation act. and In It he
states that Newlands' "proposed meas
ures for railroad legislation contain the
germ of a scientific solution of the larger
problem of industrial monopoly." A part
of the Newlands plan, as shown by a
joint resolution presented to the United
States Senate, is that all the big railroad
managements should be consolidated un
der Government, control, that their taxes
should be fixed and certain and that
their dividends should be % flxed. so that
hereafter "all increased business would
tend either to a betterment of roads, to
an . increase in wages or to a diminution
in rates."
* In his discussion of the trust problem
the author Is emphatically of the opin
ion that the trusts have come to stay,
or, at least, that the centralizing of in
dustrial productidn in great organiza
tions is a development from which we
cannot go backward. . He says the
talk of destroying them is puerile, and
quotes John Moody's "the trust has
arisen as the natural outcome or evolu
tion of societary conditions." He takes
issue with the men who believe in let
ting these developments drift and leav
ing the matter to enlightened selfish
ness of business men; his interpretation
of the, doctrine of ; "laissez-faire" is
"every, man for himself and.the' devil
take the hindmost." He says the So
cialist puts his philosophy into six
words: "Let the nation . take the
trusts."
] The work expresses a great deal, of
sympathy for the laborers. There is
also a . section ;of the book. Part 111,
which he ; entitles "The Surplus Man,"
and the definition of that genus is this:
"The surplus man is one who, under the
conditions that surround him, 13 unable
to satisfy, his 'reasonable wants." The
spirit of the volume may be compre
hended from the following quotation
from Walt Whitman, which is used as a
motto for. Part 111, 'at the beginning of
the: chapter called - "The Wounded on
the Economic Battlefield":
"I seize the descending man, : and raise
\u25a0v -i â¢him with" resistless will.
O despairer. here is my neck;
By God!; You shall not go down! Hang
your whole weight upon: me."

Washlnston Crop Bulletin.
Th* report of G. X. Salisbury. Section Di
rector, U. S. Weather Bureau, for the Washing
ton Crop Bulletin week eaatd October 2. is as
1 olloTvc :
The week was generally cold, with frequent
2ifrht showers in the eastern counties. The
tains rreatly improved puÃicres end were â¢â¢Â£
benefit ta late vegetables ana root crops. They
\u25a0were unfavorable for hop picking-, delaying it
corisiderably. With favorable weather picking
will be completed by the end of the coming
week. In some yards the crop ie a good one.
but generally it is below expectations.
Fruit picking and packing have been inter
â¢rupted by the rains. Grapes are reported, to
h^ve done wtll in the vicinity of Detroit. MÂ»
fon County. Prune drying it ftbout finished.
The crop trts not generally large. Apples and
rears are plentiful in the western counties.
Potato digging has been delayed by the wet
Tseathcr. Generally the crop Is turning out
well but there are some localities in the
eastern counties where tne yield will not be
" more than half a crop.
Whe*.t tnraehlng is over, except in Douglas
County. Oat thrashing in the northwest coun
ties, which was interrupted by rains, is in
intermittent progress. Some oats have been
discolored by exc-e-asive moisture.
' The rains have put the soil in excellent con
dition for plowlrg and for fall wheat sowing.
Â« Flowing is to progress in both western ad east
ern counties, fall wheat sowing is general In
tfce fall wheat districts, although some wheat
has bef>n sawn in the dust. Previous to the
recent rains it was too dry for the wheat to
come up. Eocie has now sprouted.
Tb* reason ir.ay be regarded as a very suc
cessful cue for crops. Heavy rainfall In May
" and June caused high expectaiione for a
bdni>er crop of wheat, but unfortunately dry
weather :n Juiy and August lowered the pros
pects .-oirsewhat. Some wheat was injured by
hot winis, but on the whole the crop was
average, or above average, in most districts.
The oat crop was e.lÂ»i somewhat lessened,
and *a were potatoes in the eastern counties.
Fruit In the e&Ftera counties was injured by
late frosts and blown oft by high winds. The
hay "crop was for the most part a good os*.
axd was saved in (tool condition.
TbÂ« 3loney Outlook.
Henry Clews s>ay3 in his New York circular
cl Se^tinsbtr Zn:
"The imniciiatc outlook doÂ»s not favor a
return to the redundant money conditions that
have be*a current thus far this year. \u25a0â¢ It
would not *>c surprising if -a still higher call
money rate shouid obtain during the com
ing wtclt. Tiie Bank or England, as v.-aÂ« cx
pectr-d. advanced its minimum discount rate
on Thursaay to 4 per cer.t. which fltrure has
not been current siiice September. 190.'t. This
action mey be rejrardc-d a further har.dlcaip
â¢ on the gold movement; at any , rate it will
need 2. materially higher money market li*r*
to attract the metal. The negotiations that
' are imported fcr a joint loan at Paris and
Berlin of $150.0iXt,CW to Russia will neces
c&rily irfi-enco v curtallnrient of outstanding
PrÂ»r*rh and Gcrrnrii funds, end while It is
quite tru* that both the cent em were more or
lets prepared for financing cis Indemnity pay
Â«ient by Russia of considerably greater mag
nitude than the lean now prcr>os<4d. tho sig
nificance of the current negotiations from a
money octlook EtanCrioint :s that funds that
w*-re <^->nsidered released when the indemnity
was wcived must axain be accumulated. In
s.Qdition to the check upon sold relief, the
local money market during the Immediate
future must experience tht contraction re
*tulrÂ»-d for thÂ» rweular October dividend and
*nt<TMt disbursements, of which something
like $75,000,000 to 550.000.000 are payable
through New York financial instltuticns. In
thi6 connection it is cf interest to note that
the dividends payable by distinctly industrial
concerns tlus October exceed those of last
!*ar by something like $1,000,000. Another
s-ource of contraction is the payment which is
dvÂ» to-day of $25,000,C00 on account of Perm-
Fl'lvania convertible*, and a similar pa>-ment
rt $12,GOO,<"00 czi eccount of tfce Atehiscn.
The third irf:tal!in;rit of SW.WH). COO on, account
ot tliÂ» J?_?anese loan will tipcome due about
th<> middle of Octnbor. and there Is reason to
o l*li"v* a very corsiJcra.b!e part of this pay
xtif.n wiM rroreptly find it* wey to London.
T.-h'ch wiJJ naturally have the effect of putting
t:p *"xchr^it:e rates ne \rell as thr monks' rate

tended, and there is little In s'r.'.u to euggest

pit. 'was inclined to bearishness. At the open
ing-December was off ft to U@?sC, ' at~*.B4%s
84 lie to 85c. . Oue of the factors mainly ; re
sponsible was tho failure of the; market at
Liverpool to respond to an advance here yes
terday. The reason . for the comparative
weakness at Liverpool, it was said, was a
general belief in the likelihood of a much
heavier movement of > wheat from . Russia
within the next few weeks. Another factor
in the initial depression here was ideal weath
er tor the movement of the new crop' in the
Northwest. From the start many small hold
era were eager to dispose of their lines. Com
mission houses also had selling orders. Be- (
fore the end of the first hour December had
sold oft to 84%@8494c. Lack of any. definite
news regarding export business had consid
erable Influence on trading. As a result of
moderate demand from a leading- bull the j
loss was â¢ later all practically regained, De
cember at- one time selling at 85'{,e. During
the last hour- prices fluctuated within a nar
row range. The market closed bteady, with
December off >s<@ttc, at 84Ti@e5c.

Hny and Feedstuffs.
The best grades of Hay continue firm and
prices have again moved up. Complaint of
the scarcity of cars is still heard. Liverrhore
and Hollister complain that they cannot get
them. - Some points on* the main lines can
obtain. them, but those on the side lines can
not. Of yesterday's arrivals of 32S tons there
were only 15 cars.
Feedstuffs remain as before quoted.
The Hay circular of Scott & Magner says:
"Arrivals of Hay for tho week have been
3150 tons, the. smallest for several months. The
fields are practically cleaned up, with the ex
ception- of the Alfalfa, districts. The larger
proportion of the Hay has been coming by
water,- consisting of Alfalfa Hay and the
cheaper varieties of Hay from the bay enorts.
Receipts on .the cars have been exceedingly
light, as cars have continued rather scarce.
The good varieties of -Hay are being taken
from warehouse. The market has decidedly
advanced for choice varieties of Wheat and
Wheat and Oat. but other classes have sym
pathized with this upward movement in pnets.
We quote choice Wheat Hay to-day at JlÂ«,
with occasional sales of something exceedingly
gilt edge at above this -figure. Choice Wheat
and Oat Hay, fll to Jl4 50; No. 1 Wheat or
Wheat and Oat. ?13 to *li) 50; choice tame Oat,
$12 per ton. /The market for Alfalfa Hay is
weaker, tho -continued good weather permit
ting the further harvesting, and the large
amounts that have been ' steadily coming in
have tended to produce this effect. . A soft
market may be expected until after the first
rains. Choice varieties of Alfalfa bring $9 50
and the poorer grades sell down to $t> 50.
Straw is doing , better. Choice is now being
taken out of store and shipped in on a basiÂ»
of 50c. San Francisco delivery. Some ooor
Straw is \u25a0 offering, but is difficult to place,
even' at 30c or 35c . per bale."

The past week . has been quiet, with nothing
new except the announcement of prices for

tinue firmly held at previous prices,
Mail . advices from New York say of Apri
cots: "Jobbers who bought, quite liberally
from short sellers early In the season on the
basis of sVjc f.-.0. b. for choice Royals- in
bags are not getting the goods, the sellers
finding themselves in the position ot being
unable to make deliveries. It is said that they
are endeavoring to make cash settlements with
more or 1e33 succÂ«s3, but buyers need the stock
to make jrood their engagements, and. with,
the upward tendency of prices on the ccaat,
are beginning to direct inquiries thither. The
supply on the coast is held to bÂ« exception
ally small for this time of the- year. Growers
are said to hold not more than fifty cars, and
what is in packers' hands, with possibly one
exception, amounts to very little."

SALES IN THE SUBURBS.
I Baldwin & Howell report that there is
a lively demand for lots In the new sub
division of San Mateo Park, near the Bur
iingame station and also near the new
public school being erected at the inter
section of Barroilhet avenue and the coun
ty road. Sales have been made in this
tract during the week. Several sales are
also reported In the Hayward addition to
San Mateo, amounting to $15,000.
On Labor day, less than one month
ago, the first subdivision of Burlingame
Park, formerly owned by the Sharon es
tate, was placed on the market by Lyon
& Hoag. In this subdivision the land was
cut up on the average basis of 50x150 feet,~
with prices ranging from $450 to $600.
These prices include the cost of macada
mizing, grading and sewering of all the
streets, as well as the installation of a
water system. Since this time upward of
200 lots have been actually sold, some of
them for cash, but many on easy terms.
Lyon & Hoag consider that they have ef
fected an unprecedented sale, ,as the land
was laid out as a park in subdivisions by
Ralston and others twenty-five or thirty
years ago.
-The residence to be erected for "Joseph
D. Grant on the northwest corner of Web
street and Broadway will cost $80,000.
Architects are preparing plans for the
large building that will be erected for
the Bank of California on the northwest
corner of California and Sansome streets.

The Nevada City .-Miner Transcript
tells'the following story about the
yield- of the Sultana mine, which \ was
once abandon ed as being worthless : .
After a run of twenty-eight days the gold
bar> that was finally. |neltÂ«d/ ready to taketo
the. express orflcei for, shipment to the mint,,
was valued at $11 .000. ' This was . from a ; ten
stamp mill, .which means that the ore was
better than the - average Â« run â¢or : rock that is
taken from- Grass Valley mints.
Enough ground has been opened up and ore
blocked out.tokcep a tliirty-stamp mill going,
for 'sometime.- . *', ' . . ' \u25a0

such satisfactory returns Is Vone_that .was

that will be spent on the Sultana and Prescott

GREAT DEPOSITS FOUND.
â¢ There is ' interest In Southern .. Cali
fornia because of the reported discov
ery "of "a great' amount of gold-bearing
ore In a rangeof mountains near Riv
erside' that have been neglected ; for
some;years. claims,"" according - to
the Los Angeles Herald, are .within
: twenty-five -miles of Riverside. , The
account is In part as follows: .
The " discovery is located In the : Santa Ana
; Mountains of ; Orange County and \u25a0â¢ for . some
time a syndicate of. Los men have
been quietly acquiring scores of mining claims
until they have, secured control practically of
an , entire, mountain, the greater portion â¢of
which is said to be a mass. of ore.'- For years
the. Santa Ana Mountains of Orange County
haye r been; prospected and known to contain
vast: mineral deposits, but the prospector, aftei
delivering . his samples to the assay - office
would be disappointed: to; find ;. that % the ore
i wag . very low grade, \u25a0â¢- containing too small
'veins -In gold to warrant " further development,
! and aÂ» a result he would abandon his claims
and seek other fields. : : - ;
There have been made \u25a0of these ores scores
of tests other than the usual fire tests, which
have from $500 to $20,000 ' per ton in
gold. . For f the past ! four years metallurgists
and chemists have been experimenting with
the ore, ' with the object "of finding a method
by which " the ores can be treated without the
fire test. . . ." :
' If is - claimed that the problem has been
solved and If this is a fact it will mean
that within this region will be located the
largest, gold-producing camp in the world.
The claim ( Is made that the deposits of ore*
In the Santa Ana Mountains are the largest
ever discovered - and the successful treatment
of the ores will result in an output that is
beyond calculation. â¢'
The strike that "Shorty" Harris Is
reported . to have made twenty-seven
miles north of Ballarat. the Inyo Inde
pendent mentions as, follows:
The new find is located about- eight miles
north of Wild Rose Springs. The old' "dry
trail," : as it is called, leading to Blackwater,
passes within a stone's throw of it. The
strong cropping has been seen- by maybe a
thousand men in the last few years, as every
one going' and' coming .from Furnace Creek
uped thl strati. Parts ol the vein carry low
values. The float from the footwall, or low
grade side, vm strewn In the trail, but ! none
of it -interested the prospector. No attention
was paid to the "big vein' on the 'trail", as
every traveler knew it. Pete Aguerebery and
"Shorty" Harris 'came over the â¢ Blackwater
trail from..: Furnace Creek en route to Bal
larat. . They , were not partners, but happened
to be traveling together. It waa understood
between them that If anything should be dis
covered they should divide ~ tha location as
near as "possible. Aguerebery was lagging be
: hind and Shorty had passed him about a mile
when Pete came ; to the supposedly barren crop
; pings. Not knowing -of their general . reputa
tion he-picked up some of the rock and looked
It over carefully. He says that the. very first
piece showed some ; free gold. This influenced
him to climb around on the steep cropplngs and
select many pieces for future horning. That
night while in camp at Wild Rose this was
done, and the importance of the \u25a0 strike was
evident at once. . The next day the. two went
back and surveyed the ground. " The "cropplngs
were found to be about 800 feet long and very
resular. .

POET SWINBURNE
DENIED A VOTE
Disfranchised Upon a Mere
Technicality in the Regis
tration Laws of England
INSANE GIVEN BALLOT
One Man Counts as Two Be
cause He Happens to Live
on Borough Border Line
LONDON. Oct. 7.â Some of the absurdi
ties and inconsistencies of the British
legistration laws, by which the right of
citizens to vote is determined, have been
strikingly shown this week by the deci
sions reached in several cases that have
come before the revision courts. How en
tirely they ignore all considerations of in
tellectual fitness has been revealed in the
diesfranchisement of Algernon Charles
Swinburne, the famous poet, on a tech
nicality. K .
Swinburne has for some thirty years
lived in a house at Putney with his
friend. Mr. Watts-Dunton. The evi
dence submitted showed that he pays half
of the rent and half of the household
expenses. But Watts-Dunton's name
alone appears in the agreement between
landlord and tenant. On that ground the
revising barrister held that he could
recognize only the legal tenant, and Swin
burne therefore was not entitled to a
vote. This great literary figure is thus
classified with paupers and deprived of
the rights of a British citizen.
As though to make clear the paradox
ical character of the registration laws,
the legal solon at Colgate solemnly grant
Â«d a vote to a lunatic on the ground that
a. private paying lunatic "must be con
sidered as a person able to return to his
occupation at will." Thus while the
greatest living poet of the English
speaking world is deprived of his vote,
the lunatic is not only allowed to vote,
but has it thrust upon him.
VOTE FOR HEAD AXD LEGS.
Wandsworth furinshed another exhi
bition of comical legal fatuity. A man
burdened with the queer patronymic of
Halfpenny occupies a house, half of
which is in the borough of Wands
worth and the other half In the ad
joining borough of Battersea. When
he retires to his couch for the night
his head is in Wandsworth and his legs
in Battersea. He had already been
granted a vote In Battersea. but not
satisfied with that -c claimed also a
vote in Wandsworth. The official, to
whose discriminating judgriient the
matter had been referred held that it
had been an error 'to enfranchise his
legs, but that decision having been re
corded it would have to stand. Such
a blunder, however, he gravely de
clared, would not justify him in dis
franchising Mr. Halfpenny's head. And
so Halfpenny received two votes as
though he held two freeholds in sep
arate constituencies.
At Clapton the right to a vote of the
notorious Smyth-Piggotl, the self
styled Messiah, was contested on the !
.ground that he no longer occupied the
house there which is leased in his
name, having transferred his residence
to the "Abode of Love" in Somerset
shire. But as he was still responsible
for the rent of the Clapton domicile,
the revising barrister ruled that he was
entitled to a vote in respect to it.
MINISTERS AS PAUPERS.
At Filongeley five aged Wesleyan
ministers, occupying cottages belong- .
ing to some beneficent trust and for
which they paid only a nominal rent of
a penny a week, were disfranchised on
the ground that the cottages were prac
tically .-ilmshouses and their occupants
were in the same category as paupers.'!
At Kensington several working-men
were deprived of their votes because
during the hard time? of last winter
they had been employed on relief work.
"I'uder English law recipients of gut- :
door relief, without discrimination, are ,
disfranchised. It is a penalty for pov
erty which many workingmen bitterly
recent.
When a Liberal Government comes
.into- power it is expected that it will
do something to simplify the British
registration laws and sweep away the
cobwebs spun by legal spiders across
the door of the polling booths.

CARNEGIE TO LISTEN
TO LATIN PRAYER.
/,#//-*/ 0/ &6irÂ£o W//# r jÃ^ Present at lnstallation
Ceremonies at St. Andrew's University.
CHURCH \T ST. VDREW'S UNIVERSITY, SCOTLAND, WHERE A UNIQUE
DEMONSTRATION WILL TAKE PLACE WHEN ANDREW CARNEGIE IS.
WITH DUE POMP AND FOR THE SECOND TIME, INSTALLED RECTOR.
LONDON. Oct. 7. â Some 350 scarlet
gowned students of St. Andrew's Uni
versity, Scotland, botli male and female,
will "boo" a prayer delivered in Latin
on October 17, and Andrew Carnegie
will smile at them meanwhile. If the
prayer is prolonged beyond what they
d-ein a proper length for such an ex
hibition of perfunctory piety the stu
dents will drown the speaker's voice by
bursting into song. In that event the
Laird of Skibo will probably chuckle,
for he takes no stock In dead language
as an aid to education and is not at
all strong on theology.
The occasion of this unique demon
stration will be the installation of Car
negie for the second time as rector of
the oldest of Scotch universities; Ever
since the foundation of the university,
early in the fifteenth century, the cere
monies attendant on the installation of
the rector have been opened by a prayer
in Latin. Prtor to the Reformation, of
course, it was regarded as something
sacred Just when the students began
to "boo' it is not known, but they
have been doing It for more than one
hundred years, and It is regarded/ as
one of their most cherished privileges
with which no member of the faculty
would dare to Interfere. Even when the
late Marquis of Bute, one of the most
fervid of Roman Catholics, was - in
stalled as rector, the students pro
claimed their contempt for the Latin
i invocation in the customary fashion.
But the Marquis did not smile.. There
has never been any evidence that Prov
idence ever objected either to the pray
or in a dead language or to the inter
ruption that accompanies Its delivery.
HOXOttS FOR AMERICA -VS.
The installation ceremonies this year
in the "old gray city, by the northern seas"
will be of unusual Interest because of
: the predominance of Americans among
those on whom honors will bo be
| stowed. The honorary degree of LL.
ID. will be conferred on two Ameri
â¢ can Embassadorsâ Whltelaw Reid and
Charlemagne Tower^and on Bishop
Potter of New. York, Nicholas Murray
1 Butler, president of Columbia Unlver
! sity. New York, and W. J. Holland, di
| rector of the Carnegie Museum. Pitts
burg. The other recipients of L 1... D.'s
will be LÂ«ord Low, Lord Ardwall, Sir
Robert Pullar and Professor David
I Masson â all Scotchmen. The uomlna
i tlons for these honors sire vested In
I the rector. As a Scotto-Amerlcan he
I has distributed them between the land
! of his birth and the land of . his adop-
I tion, and given the preference to the
I latter. , . ' : ' . \u25a0 : '
i Usually the ceremonial, takes place
in the hall of the University Library,
but because this year the spectators
I who desire to witness It will be more
numerous than on any previous occa-
Ll sion it will' be held in the largest gath
ering place the city affords â Volunteer
Hall. Carnegie will arrive from Skibo
Castle on" the night pt the 6th. He will
Â¥iIE- : SAN FRANQSOiOALL^^^^
be met at the railway station by a
band- of. students 'who will- tunefully
assure him that;they regard him as
"a jolly good: fellow, which nobody can
deny." To the accompaniment of cheer
ing and singing they will escort, him
to Scores Park, where he -will. be. the
guest of Principal Donaldson, vice
chancellor of the university. â¢
INSTALLATION CEHEMOMAL
Next afternooiy will witness the:in
stallation and graduation ceremonial.
Vice Chancellor Donaldson will preside.
With him on the platform, will ber'the
members of the "henatus Acadotnicus"
of the university in their robes, rep
resentatives of. other Scotch-universi
ties also in robes, and bigwigs of va
rious sorts. .The brilliancy of the scene
will be enhanced by the gaudy colored
robes prescribed for the students, which
has caused the ancient universityto be
styled *'the college of the scarlet
gown." . \u25a0
To the vice chancellor falls the task
of delivering the prayer,, In Latin, which
the students take. g00d... care ; nobody,
ever hears.: Then' the prcside'nt of the
Students' /Representative Council asks
the vice chancellor to install the rector.
The vice chancellor says. something in
Latin, which is quite as unintelligible
as Choctaw to Carnegie. - The janitor
of the universityâ -a man of learning by
the wayâ then, arrays Carnegie in^ his
official robes of black silk bespangled
with gold lace. As the Laird is !a
dumpy little man he. cuts rather an
amusing figure in this rig,_ but even
i all his millions would not suffice to
make him a St. Andrew's rector without
it. While the ; robing ' ceremony Is
under way. the students .break loose
again and cheer vociferously. When
the din has subsided. the rector delivers
his inaugural, address .and while .he
Is speaking rthe reporters take things
easy, for they know that revised proof
slips of it are already In their offices.
CONFERRING OF DEGRKES.,
The* recipients of the honorary de
grees have their, innings next. Kach
one of them in turn is presented to the
vice chancellor by ; the 'dean of the
faculty of arts/Professor Lawrs*bn.
Helped out by facts from "Who's
Who." the professor^.makes a brief
speech telling what each man has done
to merit the dignity bl : doctor of laws,
the victim of the ordeal {meanwhile
striving his best te -put on' what is
termed a deprecatory, smile. ;'â¢' Then tlie
learned janitor puts- a gorgeous V scar
let robe on him while students and
spectators cheer. : " The vice chancellor
confers the' degree on 'him by tapping
him on. the. head with the "cap," a
venerable piece of cloth," and pronounc
ing a Latin form ; of .words. "At the
same 'time the ( hood ' of the LL.' D.^
made of scarlet' silk and lined with
white satinâ is placed around his neck.
When this transformation is thus com
pleted the full-fledged "doctor" shakes
hands with the vice chancellor i and the
members of the/ Seriate arid "rejoices that
he:is not required to^ make, a /speech. .
In ' the evening Carnegie * will, hold a"
reception in' the .hall and, later he will
be : invited tp ; attend asmoklng.'concert
given by; the students in the Students'
"Union Dining Hall. It: is idoubtfuljf

LONDON", Oct. 7. : â British .; publishers
are complaining of the, American * In- |
vasion of their coioniai markets. The J
Doniinlon, it is said, has ceased to be j
of any benefit to them so far as con
cerns the Canadian editions of .Ameri
can books, and now American enter- |
prise bids fair to capture the Australian |
trade. To prevent tills aiid recover the
ground that has been lost, it has been
gravely, proposed that pressure "should !
be 'brought -to bear upon- American ,au- '\u25a0
thors. publishers, it -is sug- ',
gested, should decline to" buy American [
books 'unless' they be glvcn ; sole colo-^
nial rightÃ in' them. ; â¢ - ,
'"There is a "certain group of London
houses which. \u25a0 to ; all ' intents and., pur-"
poses," says the sponsor for this ingen
ious scheme, "control the English edi
tions of.the best American novels. If
they were collectively to'-blnd- them-:
selves to refuse any book- Offered to;
them with such reservations, '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'. they;
would be able' to' impose their own con
ditions.' Trans-Atlantic, writers"' attach
more weight to their popularity in the
old country tlfan is generally- supposed.
The question of royalties Is ; not the
only consideration; there; is; the kudo?
attaching to an English vbguÂ«' which
; counts for even more/ and the threat of
a boycott among the leading
over there would . therefore -make- a
strong; impression. But the ' combine
must bÂ£ thoroughly representative to be
effective; - there must be an\ Inflexible
observance' of the agreement ; for 'the
period settled upon by the contracting
parties. We 1 believe, that a. yÂ«ar,' or,
perhaps tv/o \u25a0 years, would be â¢' long
enough to serve the ehdin vlew.".^.,:
. /It is, hardly likely. tha,t the plan will
be tried. 'The competition among Brit
ish publishers for good American, books
is too keen to make such a combination
at all probable. ' :
"LOSS TO SEWSPAPERDOM. . .
\u25a0 By the death of L F.Austin at the
comparatively early age of - 53 London,
newspaperdom has lost -one of its most
brilliant wits and industrious workers.
Had 'not journalism early caught him
in- its tolls he might have, won-some
thing more than fleeting fame In,liter
ature.. He had an Irishman' for. his
father arid that, may have accounted for
his blithe .sense of humor. ,\u25a0â¢ He was
born in' America and that gave him the
sharpened intelligence, that â¢ .was as
ready to : analyze a Government report
as to "review a novel. Only ; those be
hind the scenes will' ever; know>the
great variety 'and * excellence of V; his
work. 'One editor has;said *of.f # 'm that
he wrote the wors'e^hstVahd uic best
stuff of any. journalist in London. ' His
calligraphy was quite as, bad as Horace
Greeley's. ,-; It : has been compared to the
tracks/ ofjjjfani inebriated ?y spider, :He
was for years a sort of. literary adviser
to Sir Henry Irving:. -j;It: was. expected
that he,would4iavo greatly assisted the
distinguished actor .'ln ; the' preparation
of the . : aiitomographyi which V he , has
promised to the world. 3'- ,v ; ..â¢
Austin was a man of charming per
sonality,' whose" genialityand unfailing
good nature endeared him* to hosts of
friends. 3 But only a few of the most
intimate among the latter were aware
of the tragedy, which made shipwreck
of "his- domestic life.': '";In-. his "younger
days he married a, barmaid. V The mar
riage, as " might have been expected,
turned out unhappily. .But he kept all
his troubles to .himself. .= He was .a
martyr to gout, which carried . him off,
and yet a short time before his death
he wrote a humorous article on\u25a0the^sub
ject: -His lively fancy and genial satire
amused and refreshed-, many, thousands
who never heard of him. 'â¢", And not a
few authors received .- their ' earliest
commendations fromlhls kindly, pen.
. CII.VBUE'S MEMOJItY HONORED.
;. Literary fame in -these: days is; not
limited by ' langauge or â¢ geographical
boundaries. JAJ A striking instance of this
is afforded by: the"' part > taken .by iL
Rene Huchon' of Nancy; University,- in
the recent celebration, at: Aldcburgh^of
the one 'hundred: and fiftieth -annlver-',
sary of the birth of. George. Crabbe. i:M.
Huchon' is recognized as^' the^g'reatest
living authority on, --the-" works of the
parson poet," and lit was he who;,deliv
ered the chief address. 1 /.Speaking; of
"The. Village," he saW that; the; poem'
was not only ; a. realistic description- of
Aldeburgh.but a satire directed against
the pastoral: ; It wis.rtruth's, emphatic"
protest against ;nction and gave realism
its place in poetry. ,: Among .the EngJish
men of letters who^paidVtributes to :,the
little-read poet ; were"! Thomas /Hardy,
and < Clement- K. Shorter. " .Though?
Cr'abbe's audience always has been, and
probabl y \u25a0 always \wlir' be a " smal 1 one, :
f ew / poets have n umbered / more distin

recall : that "on - his deathbed' Sir: Walter,

just placed a memorial tablet on No. 16
/Young street, Kensington; the house in
fwhich Thackeray did his best work. - It
was there. that he ' wrote, "Vanity Fair."
It Is, interesting to. recall, in this con

/Mr.' Fields, the American publisher, to
the various houses in. London where his
novels were ; written: ' "Go down on

than are Londoners, themselves. By

ALAMEDA NOT SERIOUSLY
DAMAGED ON ROCKS.
Liner Is Now on Hunter s Point Dry Dock
"WRECKED STEAMSHIP THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE -WATER YESTERDAY. 1
SHOWING THAT SHE HAD SEVERAL MORE WOUNDS THAN THE DIVER ;
HAD FOUXD. THE REPAIRS CAN READILY BE MADE HOWEVER.
"The Alanieda is in wonderfully fine
condit,~n considering what she has
Â«-one t'jough. She should be in com
rr.!Â£tio.i again within flfty^ days." , So
said Captain John Metcaife,' Lloyd's
Â»ur\'eyor. yesterday afternoon at Hunt
er* Point.
The â¢ liner yesterday was' placed on
the larger of the. drydocks. It was
nearly dark before the water had been
pumped. out of the big basin, but, the
water in the Alameda, pouring;. through
the wounds in her. hull, fixed the lo
cation of the Injuries and, ' to a cer
tain decree, their extent.
The diver did not find all- the punc
tures. There axe others, eight of them,
all considerably smaller than the one
the submarine operator patched. There
are four holes on the port side, two
well forward: the one under the boil
ers, located by the diver, and a email
puncture ,a V ttle * urtncr ***;" In the
bow on the" starboard side are four '
smsJl holes In a row. made probably i
tvhen the Alameda wrecked the rock !
on which she- struck -and stuck last
Saturday week off Fort .Point.. There
is another bole farther, aft*
The examination ' of - the ; vessel's ln-
Jurjes,, however, has been but super-;
f. ci al and some : of : her -injuries may be
more extensive; than they- appeared In j
the waning . light of yesterday. Apart
from the punctures 'the Alameda looks
very much as usual- and the surveyors
<*-o cot think 'she suffered any serious
It train.
This much, is knownâ the liner, can '<
be repaired and when the work is done!
she will; be just as good as'ever, Kith!
her reputation , for good luck consid
erably enhanced.

liner off the rocks just in .time... Wifti
the exception of a. heavy,: swell- one
morning- the sea: was calm 'arid the
weather. fine during'the Alameda's en-_
forced stay at Fort Point. She was
taken off the rocks at 6:20 .o'clock
Friday evening-. Yesterday mornings a
thirty-eight-mile-an-hour wind .was
sweeping past Fort Point and where
the Alameda rested for nearly. ai.week
huge waves were breaking, angry pos
sibly because Captain Pillabury had
balked them of their Drey.
'.The A-lameda still has about 300 tons
of cargo in. her. hold. The holes in her

HUNGARIAN COUNTESS
RETURNS TO STAGE.
Will Be Heard in T^his Country in Opera
WELL-KNOWN HI7NGARIAX SINGER WHO IS ABOUT TO RETURN TO THE
\u25a0STAtiK'AN'D APPEAR IK LIGHT OPERA, HAVING GROWN WEARY OF DO
MESTIC- LIFE" AND TJiE, GAY â¢ SOCIAL WORLD. '
\u25a0 VIENNA, Oct. 7.â llka yon Talmay,
tbc beautiful and famous Hungarian
light opera singer who married Count
.tugene Kinsky and retired from tho
stage, but who recently returned to it
again, will stay five months in the
United States. . '
'1 have made no contracts," she said
recently, "with any American theaters
or managers, preferring not to do so
until after 1 arrive in New York. I
have had many inquiries and offers, but
as 1 know nothing of the conditions on
the American s^tage I prefer to le;\vÂ«
myself free for the time. But I am
sure 1 shall like America and the peo
ple. I know already so many Ameri
cans and have heaps of friends among
them."
The Countess expects, to 1 appear only
in light opera'ln English, although' she
plays in . four '. languages â English,
French, German and Hungarian. "
, It is now slightly more than twelve
years since this sprightliest of Hunga
rian footllgnt favorites forsook the
staj?e .'ifter marrying into the distin
guished and noble house of Kinsky.
That, however, was not her first matri
monial experience. She previously had
rid herself of a crazy husband by get
tiug him locked up In a madhouse, not
\u2666o mention having been tourtcd rather
ardently by four or more. other Bohe
mian and Hungarian noblemen.
As a matter of fact, Ilka yon Palmay
charmed every one who saw or met hÂ«Â«r,
Mark Twain himself, who made her
acquaintance during his visit to Vienna
several years ago, declared that "there
could have been few -more charming
or sweeter \rorr.en." Count Eugene Kin
sky, who finally won the fair singer's
heart and introduced her into the great
world, is- the handsomest scion ofÂ» a
house of proverbially handsome men.
Since her marriage. With the'excep
tion of a season in Ixmdon. when she
scored "a" great success In "The Lon
doners." tho Countess has played only
on rare occasions, and then only for
charities. For some time, however, her
domestic affairs have not gone espe
cially well, and after long deliberation,
the Countess decided to become once
more Ilka yon l*ivlnÂ»ay.-: the operetta
singer. Of the reasons which led her
to abandon fashionable life among, the
great aristocracy of Austria-Hungary,
she spoke openly, though with : nothing
but the kindest references to her late
friends and associates. '
"As my husband." she said, "persists
in gambling. I have resolved to. return
to the stage. That is all. We had no
quarrel, no trouble of any kind.' . .We
are not divorced, nor legally separated
There i$ an "honest tired feeling", caused byT.ecessary ; toil and-
cured by natural rest. But very different is "that tireH feeling,"
froiri which so. many complain, and which may even be as
a diseaseâ as a matter of fact it is a; disease,,! laying" its cause-man

in any way. We are. simply living
apart. He. is a perfect gentleman, ana
I have not a word to say against him.
His family, too, have always treated me
with the greatest kindness. But I feel
I shall be much hapier on the stage
again." .- ;> : â¢" "\u25a0'\u25a0'
Regarding, the subject of "Actresses
and Matrimony,"Countess Kinsky Pal*r
may holds very .decided views: ". "I
doubt very much," she'- remarked,
"whether actresses ought to marry at
all unless the union brings children,
and the woman becomes. fully, occupied
with the cares of family life. I am
sure they should riot. I speak notonly
from my own .experiencel I have
thought much upon - the \ subject and
frorh personal* observation^, too, have
reached this conclusion. " ' ~ . [.
"It is simply impossible for a woman
of keen artistic temperament, who has
once experienced the Joys. of dramatic
triumphs. Uo "settle down into i a quie.t
humdrum existence, even though It be
among the most" aristocratic circles. To
live with" people whose one idea Is to
amuse themselves, whose conversation
is limited to dress,and scandal in the
case of women, and to sport and ballet
dancers in male circles, is unbearable.
I do not say that .tfll Austrian- and
Hungarian fashionable people live such
selfish, empty, ] purposeless lives.; Far
from It. Many'of thenv.are highly cul
tivated, intelligent \u0084\u25a0-. and .'delightful
friends and companions., .But. there
are. alas, many others, who'thlnk and
talk of little else than dress and pleas
ure, who have no ideas of i?'*vorld-Â°ut-:
side. To be condemned Itp meet these
people in society day.ufter day is for.
a person of nitistlc ten-perament lni
possible. Far better to . return ; ; to the
stage and work for = one'sMiving in' a
congenial atmosphere and . enjoy " the
delightful oamaraderie^'only to be
found among actors ; andi artists.: .And
so." "added .the" Countess,' "this is What
I have decided to do. ' I have said fara r
well to society-life, and anfJ returning
to the stage once more. '\u25a0'' with .nothing,
but the*xnost/pleasurable;anticlpations.'
I am ' the more delighted that V it is on
the American stage that I shall ; make
my.tfirst reappearance, ; as I, have heard
somiich of the kindly generqus appre
ciation of the "American audience, and
I am most anxious, to 'make' the experi

NEW YORK. Oct: 7.â The weekly bank
statement offered a^ warning of the. small
reliunce.to be placed on yesterday's. late
decline, in \\\<Â±. call money rate as a' reflec
tion of the, situation of the money: mar
ket! Speculative sentiment was brought
to the conclusion that a stiff money mar
ket was liKely to continue. for the Imme
dtte future, 1 and there was selling of
stockaln consequence. A group of jndus^
trial' speciulties, mostly among the rail
road equipment stocks, wjth .American
Locomotive a;, eons, icuous .leader, were
notable exceptions to the general down :
ward tendency.
The decrease in cash shown ( by.;thebank
statement ran to $5,454,700, considerably
exceeding the largest of. the preliminary
estimates based on the known movements
or" money. This showing is regarded |as a
ratification in' part of the unexplained
increase , In cash reported last week,
though the full' amount of the discrep
ancy is by no: means accounted for. The
showing strengthens the supposition; that
gold engagements have been figuring in
bank- reserves as soon as made, without
waiting jfor their actual receipts The 'ef
fect ut the/decline in cash on the. sur
plus was modiiled by the. scaling down of
the deposits through a contraction -;of
Jll.SS9.4uu In outstanding loans. The Inroad
upon the surplus was thus limited .to
$3,153,850, bringing that Item down to ?4,256,
175. The loan contraction is believed to
be, due largely to the "taking over of
lojins from the banks by. out-of-town'in
stitutions, which have drawn' on their
New York deposits for that purpose dur
ing the week. -Another withdrawal "of
J2,t>00,000 from the Bank of England ;for
BhlF.m'ent to Ugypt showed the drain .upon
the â¢' depleted reserve' of that institution
unrelieved, and to 'the mainten
ance "of. money rates in foreign markets. \u25a0

The continued high" rate for money this
week has suppressed any great specula
tive" activity in stocks. Not only here,"
bqt In foreign markets, the course of
money rates has been upward, and' the,
conviction has grown that no immediate
return of easy money is to be looked for.
Operators in stocks are discouraged
from undertaking speculative cam
! palgns for an advunqe in the facÂ« of
this outlook. ' At 1 the same time the
high degree of " prosperity 'keeps alive

BAD STOMACH
MAKES BAD BLOOD.
You can't make sweet butter in a foul
churn. Even' farmer's wife knows this.
Yotir stomaca churns and digests the
food you eat, and If foul, torpid or out of
order, your wholo system suffers from
Â». blood poisoning. You will havo foul
T breath, coated tongue, bad taste, poor
appetite and a whole train of disaÂ«rree-
at>;Â« symptoms. Dr. Pierre's Goldon
Medical Discovery, which is not a bever-
age composed of whisky or alcohol, being
entirely free from intoxicants, is a great
1 regulator and invigorator of the Stom-
ach, Liver and Bowels.
"About a year ago I was ill with blood pol-
aonlns." writes Miss Erellno Louis, of 88
Walter Street. Buffalo. N. Y. "I had whr.t
teemed to be a sras.ll cold sore on my lip. It
becune very anffry In appearance and bcs&n
to spread tmtU It nearly covered zny face. I
waa a i rlchtful eicht and could not go out-
eide the bouse because of cr appearance. I
used a blood medicine which did not give
n>o any relifÂ£ Then I becran to take your
'Golden SledXcal Discovery.' I was rreatly
benefited with tbe first bottle and after tak-
ing tbe second bottle was completely cured.
Tbe erysipelatons eruption disappeared and
my blood was cleansed. My complexion is
clear and frceh and I have felt better this
rear than I did for some time before. Dr.
Pierce'Â» Golden Medical Discovery Is cer-
tainly a most remarkable medicine." 1
Don't accept a substitute for a medicine
which performs such cures and which has !
a uniformly successful record of nearly
forty years to its credit. It's an Insult to
your Intelligence for a dealer to try by
over- persuasion to palm off upon you in
Its stead some inferior article with no
record to back it up. You know what
you want; it is his business to meet that
want.

to-day a pereonal message of felicita
tion from ' Emperor William of Ger
many. ..'.-. . . .
"Do me the honor." said Bartholdt,
quoting the German Emperor, "to. con
vey to President Roosevelt my highest
personal regards."
Bartholdt said later that President
Roosevelt was held in the most cordial
estimation by the rulers of European
powers. The King of Belgium, Bar
tholdt said, had hanging in his bed
chamber, a. .handsome portrait of the
President, and he assured Bartholdt the
portrait was the first object he saw
every day. \u25a0- ..
Bartholdt -assured the President that
the sentiment in favor of the adjust
ment of international differences by
urbitration was increasing materially
in Europe. 1 â¢
Referring to the acquiescence of
President Roosevelt in the desire of
Emperor NJehola* to call the second
peace conference at The Hague. Mr.
Bartholdt said:
"It was most graceful of the Presi
dent thus to defer to Emperor Nicholas
and his action was -. cordially appreci
ated. I don't know when the confer
ence will be held, but very likely it
I'apaj be next epring. That it will ac
"^oirplish a great and lasting good I
have no doubt.- - - - .
"The German Emperor," continued
Bartholdt. "is the most intense Ameri
can in Europe. He Js genial and demo
cratic, chats frankly and really, re
minds one strongly of President Roose
velt. TJie King of Belgium is charm
ing in demeanor and frank In conversa

In 'opening '""his remarks â¢llfv^Biin*' 1

four weeks from, next Tuesday the peo
ple of Maryland "will decide
for time whereof no man can see,- they
will belong to themselves or belong to
the Democratic ring; whether 'the Statfe
shall be governed in our days and the
days of their children as it' was gov
erned in the days of our fathers, or
whether its government shall be turned
over to a gpup of selfish, grasping and
unscrupulous men, v . amd'n'g whom*, tt is
said, son is to succeed father as chief

political liberty, and .in its> full .sense,
willing to give up the name of free
men." â¢ , -\u25a0.- -; \u25a0' : â¢' . .. :
To those who doubted what success
for the amendment- would mean, Mr.
Bonaparte pointed to the recent Demo
cratic primaries and said that "not
withstanding the severe and steady
pressure- applied by the ring to secure
for the amendment a party indorse
ment, the feeling against it." even
among the most 'regular,'/ .the most
'rock-ribbed' Democrats,' was so strong
and general that, several ward execu
tives and " a number of candidates,
for local offices or the Legislature
were chosen whose opposition^ to
it was known and -avowed, and in some
instances were chosen on the very is
sue of its approval or repudiation."
He scored the committee recently ap
pointed' by "the ring or its chief" to
"put through" the amendment. He de
clared that the committee had no more
right or authority- to represent the
Democrats of Baltimore or of Maryland
than he or his audience. â¢ \ >*--', : ._\u25a0â¢;.- ...-. .';
Mr. Bonaparte, after further -denounc
ing "the ring," concluded as follows: .
"Fellow citizens, only one class of
people will be assured of their votes

men, "black as well as white, who are
owned, body and soul (if they still nave
souls), by the ring."

is not thought the bank is in danger, as
it has $400,000 cash.. on. hand. .
"We had several offers from banks

.McCURDY PAYS BLACKMAIL-
NEW YORK, Oct: 7.â When. Charles E.
Hughes, chief counsel to the legislative
insurance investigation 'committee, drew
from an 'official of the-Mutual Life Insur
ance Company on the witness stand on
Friday the. fact that --homas H. Bowles
had received $35,000 > to- settle', claims
against the company, the story was only
half, told. ;.\u25a0â¢â¢
C .The' inside history of Bowies'" campaign :
against the Mutual shows his organiza
tion, of policy-holders throughout the
United States assumed such proportions
as to alarm Richard A. McCurdy, ' presi
dent~ipt the company, arid' how Bowles
finally surrendered under the pressure of
an offer of cash waslearned to-day. \u25a0 \u25a0
-Bowles was an aggressive man. whose
success in the Middle Western States had.
been somewhat phenomenal. He was em
ployed by McCurdy and was able to ob
tain the cream of the agency force in the
South. His success from the start was
remarkable. At the time of his disagree
ment with the Mutual Life it is said he
was on the books of the company as hav
ing furnished business amounting to $75.
ooo.ooo." , : \
Bowles then became ambitious and went
sa far as to prefer charges of nepotism
and "grafting" against McCurdy, and as
the representative of policy-holders de
manded certain reforms. For his pre
sumption Bowles was dismissed. He then
rented an office and organized the policy
holders in a campaign against the Mc-
Curdy administration. ', . " . ,
..^Realizing his power and the danger of
exposure the Mutual Life paid Bowles
$35,000 to stop his campaign.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 7.â Aa agree
ment has been reached regarding t&Â«
administration's programme on legis
lation 'on ta a ' ChinesÂ© Question. .This
matter has sorely vexed thÂ« President
ever sinee -the fallura of the Calaesa
treaty last year and a few weeks ago
It threatened to bring about tnÂ« resig
nation of a certain Cabinet officer a**,
the result of a misunderstanding and
clash with a brother officer of the Cabi
net. Tna adoption of a plan satisfac
tory to all concerned has had tho af
fect of restoring complete harmony
among thÂ« Preatdant's advisers.
The bill which will. go to Congress
will have tho joint Indorsement of th*
Stat* "'Department and tha' Department
of Commerce and Labor. It. will pro
vide,. In brief, for tfca appointment of
special agents of tho immigration ser
vice to servo In tho United States con

try. .-"\u25a0,â¢. ; \u25a0 . : â¢-\u25a0- *
' The examination of certificates held
by Chinese Is now dono by consular of
ficers.' Their manner' of discharging
this' duty has given rise to a great
amount of dissatisfaction, both to tha
State* and !to the Depart
ment of Commerce and. Labor. In tha
first place, a majority of tho Consuls
seem to regard this as a gratuitous
burden thrust upon them by the For
eign Department and as haying- no re
lation to their proper duties. Conse
quently they aro inclined to neglect it
and usually turn it over to a third
party. In China tho third party Is a na
tive interpreter, whoso honesty and In
tegrity are open to doubt. According:
to the statements of high ofaclals. it
is as. much as a Chinese Interpreter's^
Ufa is worth to render an, unfavoratl'jP

MURDERERS
KILL THREE
ON A FARM
MIDDLETOWN, N. T., Oct 7.â A tri
ple murder was revealed to-day when
the bodies of Willis and Fred Olney
were found in the woods, half a mile
from their home, at which last night
was found the murdered body of Alice
Ingerick. .The brothers had been shot.
Before many hours the crime is ex
pected to number one more victim, Mrs.
Georgia Ingerick, mother of the girl
Alice. The mother, who was found un
conscious In the barn of the Olney
brothers last night, has not regained
consciousness and is believed to be dy
ing. \u25a0\u25a0 ; .: :\u25a0 \u25a0
As soon as daylight permitted a
search to be made for Fred and Willis
Olney, who were missing from their
home last night, where Mrs. Ingerick
was found unconscious and her daugh
ter, murdered, fresh. wagon tracks, lead
ing across a field to a wood near the
hause, were discovered. Just beyond in
the woods were : found the bodies of
Frod and- Willis, lying on their backs,
each with one -arm across the - breast.
Their pockets had been turned inside
out./ Marks in the underbrush showed
that the bodies had been dragged from
the wagon to the place where they were
found.
The police believe that the wagon,
which evidently | carried the murdered
brothers to the? woods, is the same ve
hicle that several persons noticed yes
terday in the vicinity of the Olney farm!
Two strangers were (in "this wagon,
which was seen going up the Old road
about 3 o'clock," when it disappeared in
the woods. " "At 11 '\u25a0\u25a0 p. m., several hours
after the time the murders were com
mitted, the \u0084wagon was seen on - the
same road going away from the vicinity
of the, Olney farm and toward the Sha
wanogunk Mountains. The fact that an
attempt was made to kill, every person
who 'was known to have been- in the 01-'
ney house has caused the ; police '* to de
clare .that I there i were other â' motives
than robbery for the crime, and that the.
rifling of "the . Olney ; brothers'- pockets
wasionly a rtise to mislead the pursu
ers. ; \u25a0 As yet, however, no plausible j the
ory., for the murder.: has been advanced;
. The , four; persons] In . the house r about
dark yesterday, ; according - to 'i Lulu * In
gerick, who left -the place ; shortly be
1 fore the tragedy,'; were Willis Olney, \u25a0 62
years; Fred Olney, 68 ; years .'old; Mrs.
Ingerick, the housekeeper of the two
brothers/ and ; her small daughter,; Alice.*
Lulu, who Is 13 years; old,* went to Mld

supper. ; Finding the house . empty,; the

the two brothers in the rifling of their
pockets were two silver .watches. Con
siderable comment was excited here by
the/similarity of position of the two
brothers' bodies found ln the woods,
as each had the right arm crossed
over the breast in . the same po
sition. Fred Olney's body had two bul
let wounds in the right side and an odd
circumstance about these "wounds wad
that they were. under the right arm ln
such a position that the arm must have
been raised high before the shots were
fired. Willis Olney waa shot through
the rlffht ear.
A possible clew to the murderers was
secured through Robert Wengatz. pro
prietor of a hotel at Howells, two miles
from where the crime was committed.
"Wengatz says two strange men called
at. his place early to-day, but did not
remain long. They drove away at a
rapid gait. One was lame. An effort
will be made to trace the strangers.
The condition of Mrs. Ingerick re
mained unchanged to-night. A close
watch Is being kept on her in the hope
that she may recover consciousness and
be able to give a clew to the mur
derers. The physicians in attendance
do not believe she can recover. Her
husband, Martin Ingerick. from whom
she parted several years ago. Is at

from the glass case where they were on

The silver medals, which were In the

taken, but were thrown on the floor by
the thief. None of the valuable speci

to be no clew as to who perpetrated the
deed and the theft was not discovered
until this morning. The local officers
are now at work on the case, but have

GREAT RALLY AT THE ALHAMBRA
IS SET FOR TUESDAY NIGHT.
The candidacy of John S. Partridge for Mayor of the city is surely^growing in public favor. Under the leadership of rep
resentative young men of the two prominent political parties.the campaign in his behalf is being conducted with exceptional
energy. The remarkable demonstration in support of the fusion nominees at the: Mission last Friday; night dazed the
grafters and vice promoters of the Schmitz administration. The great ratification meeting at Alhambra Xheater next
Tuesday night will inspire citizens to renewed efforts in the cause of clean government. Joseph S.Tobin will preside.
Partridge will speak. , N
DISCUSS PLANS
OF CAMPAIGN
Joint Fusion Committee
Meets With the Kegular
Nominees of the Ticket
HICKEY IN THE CHAIR
Arrangements for District
and Large Rallies Refers
red to Executive Board
In line with the active prosecution of
the campaign, the majority of the Joint
campaign committee of the Fusion party
met last night In Native Sons' Hall with
the candidates on the Fusion ticket to dis
cuss the plans for the carrying forward of
the campaign. The meeting took place be
hind closed doors, and while the main dia
cusslon was confined to Interparty af
fairs, many new announcements were
made. Vice Chairman Hlckey presided.
One of the first things before the meet-
Ing was the fixing of the assessment of
each candidate, which was done satisfac
torily. That being disposed of the meet
ing took up the outlining of plans for
eight large rally meetings to take place
between now and election.
The question then arose as to whether it
would be more expedient to hold the large
rallies or devote two nights a week in each
district to district rallies. At these dis
trict rallies the speakers of the campaign
would follow one another. It was finally
decided to refer the entire matter to the
executive committee and it is probable
that both forms of meetings will be de
cided on. A list of those who will speak
â¢will be placed on the wall at Fusion head
quarters amenable to the suggestions of
the orators.

TICKET HEADED
BK BARTLETT
Boston Man Nominated for
Governor by the Demo
crats of Massachusetts
BOSTON, Oct. 7.â General Charles W.
Bartlett of Boston 'to-day was'nomi
nated by the Massachusetts Democracy
for Governor. There were no contests
for any of the places on the ticket. The
full ticket nominated follows:
Governorâ General Charles W. Bart
lett, Boston.
~" Lieutenant Governor â Henry M.
Whitney, Brookline.
Secretary of State â Henry B. Little,
Newburyport. â¢
Treasurer and Receiver General â
Daniel j. Doherty, Westfleld.
Auditor â P. J. Ashe, North Adams.
. Attorney Generalâ John T. Leahy,
Boston.
The only ripple of discord during the
day came upon the nomination by the
convention of eighteen â¢ members at
large of the \u25a0 State Committee. Daniel
T. j Toomey of j Springfield . made an un
successful attempt to have the conven
tion decree that hereafter the members
of the State committee : be eleoted di
rectly by the people , at the : Senatorial
and Congressional conventions. Toomey
charged that the Democratic State Com
mittee as at present constituted did not
represent, the Democratic voters, but
was. instead, a close corporation' that
dictated the party policy and candi
dates.
Up to the time that James H. Cotter
of Hyde Park arose to place before the
convention the name of General Bart
lett as the gubernatorial candidate it
was believed there would be a contest.
Former Mayor John H. McNamee of
Cambridge had., announced that he
would make a struggle for. the honor
of leading: the party in .' the coming
campaign. To the surprise of the con
vention, however, Mr. McNamee did not
make any contest, but seconded Gen-
mittee of the fusion forces. >v
At headquarters, 636 Market street,
last evening Frank Jordan and Mr.
Pratt demonstrated that the voting
machine was absolutely reliable. The
machine will count the votes accurately
for each and every candidate. Twenty
flve machines, the last .installment of
the whole number of 206. will bÂ« in
San Francisco in a few days. -The
number of machines for actual duty in
the various precincts on election day
will be 198. Eight machines will be
held in reserve to meet any emergency
that may arrive.
Louis Sloss, chairman of the finance
committee of the joint executive com
mittee appointed by Daniel A. Ryan
and Thomas W. Hlckey. to conduct * the
campaign, will find the "sinews \u25a0": of
war" for the fusion ticket. ' The z San
Francisco Republican League easily
enough /secured a sufficient sum Y of
money to meet the expenses of the pri
mary campaign. The people of San
Franciscoâ the good â¢ men and noble
womenâ are with the leaders of : the
fusion movement in the conflict to
stamp out dishonesty, Indecency and
Immorality in the administration of
municipal affairs." '
Committees appointed to wage the
fight in support of clean government
will 'devise some' effective method of
reaching out into every election pre
cinct and bringing to the polls citi
zens who ordinarily pay but little'at
tention to the civic duty of voting.
The ruffians and grafters who . were
boastful and defiant at " the . beginning
of the popular crusade against inde
cency and vice are now singing in a
subdued tone and pleading that the
Ruef administration Is not as shady,
and disreputable as the press repre
sents it to be. The people, however,
can see for themselves what the town
is to-day. They have had enough of.
the Ruef and Schmitz kind of govern
ment and are determined that a change
is necessary to save the metropolis
from degradation in the eyes of the
world.
Syndicate writers for the inland
newspapers predict that Schmitz will
be ' overwhelmingly defeated if Â©the
"stay at homes" turn out on election

. MAKES TARIFF THE ISSUE.
The platform adopted was as fol
lows:
"The paramount issue at this time be
fore the- people of Massachusetts is relief
from tariff restrictions. The effect of this
policy forced upon the dominant Repub
lican party by the greed of great and
selfish Interests has been to cut Massa
chusetts from its national markets of
sale or purchase and to push the State
toward the danger line of Industrial de
cline. It is shown in trade reports, finan
cial statements and census â¢ returns that
while the industries of the country as a
whole have materially Increased in tho
past decade those of this State have re
mained nearly stationary. We believe
that a sensible relief from these evils
could be obtained without disturbance to
business by placing upon the free list: a
number of the raw materials of our In
dustries, such as coal, iron, lumber,
hides and wool, and by the immediate
enactment of a dual tariff law which,
while having the present tariff as its
maximum, would give liberal reductions
in duty rates to those nations that will
accord to us favorable trade opportuni
ties. -\u25a0\u25a0 '. :' '-\u25a0â¢) ,
"We believe , that , general laws should
take the place of special laws in legisla

used for political purposes; that, as the
tariff is the mother , of trusts, these off
spring should jbe deprived of the exces
sive protection by- means of which they
are oppressing the; people; that United'
States Senators should be elected by the
people, and that, pending the passage of
a ' constitutional ; amendment. State legis

ning With Fair Dancers
No . regular political meetings were
scheduled for Mayor Schmitz last night
because of the postponement of the rati
fication meeting: at the Alhambra Thea
ter, and Instead of discussing the cam
paign issues with crowds of listeners, he
gave himself up to an evening of pleas
ure. He opened three masquerade balls,
spoke shortly at a smoker and visited for
a time one of the benefit booths of St.
Francis Fair.
The first real stay the Mayor made was
at the bartenders' ball, at Saratoga Hall,
840 Geary street. Here hÂ© made an In
troductory speech, thanking tha members
of the Bartenders' Union for their kind
ness in sending him an invitation and ex
pressing the pleasure he always found In
their company. ' He danced on the floor
for an hour and then left for another so
cial affair south of Market street. The
ball. was a masquerade and was enjoyed
by fully "a hundred guests. E. Vera
acted as floor manager.
Mayor Schmitz opened the Pattern
Makers' smoker and high' jinks, held on
the second floor of the Alcazar building.
Here he spoke only a few minutes, ex
pressing his pleasure at being present
at the annual smoker and touching
slightly on questions of the campaign.
The members of the Pattern Makers'
Union held their election of - officers,
with the following results: W. H. Eg
gerbrecht, president; J. Hause, vice pres
ident; J. G. Loshack, secretary; F. G.
Myer, treasurer. >
A large club was in attendance at the
Alhambra Club masquerade ball, which'
was held in Elntracht Hall, Folsom and
Twelfth street. Unusually clever cos
tumes, were everywhere to be seen and
the laughter of daintily'dressed'women
and their companions filled the hall.
Mayor Schmitz arrived, late at the ball
and made a very short speech..
The Boilermakers and Iron Ship
builders of America held their twenty
fifth anniversary ball'at Lyric Hall, 121

WOMEN OF SOUTH
CLOSE SESSIONS
Daughters of the Confeder
acy End Their Convention
After Busy Deliberations
The last day of the Confederate Daugh
ters' convention was fraught with busy
cares, many of which were - prolonged
with tedious technicalities.
From the start most of the time was
devoted to amendments to the constitu
tion, the only break In this monotony
being the introduction of the flag's cus
tody. Mrs. Van Wyck, president of the
Jefferson Davis Chapter, was nominated
for custodian of Dixie's emblem, Mrs.
Hlckman, the new* recording secretary,
receiving the same honor, but retired in
favor of her opponent.-.
Some discussion followed as to the cus
todian's personal responsibility for the
flag; the house divided between having it
remain in the care of this city until the
next national convention, and sending It
on to the Solid South room of the Con
federate Museum at Richmond. After
a proper weight of pros and cons, a bal
ance was obtained with the flag to repose
In the Solid South room, Mrs. Van Wyck
also being regent of that memorial.
A report from the committee on his
torical souvenirs, with recommendation
of ; emblems for use in book covers, con
veyed information pleasantly distracting
from the prosiness of amendments. On
motion of Mrs. MacLouth, the report was
adopted. r
With the weight of business still to be
transacted. Mrs. White of Tennessee
moved that the trip planned for the day
by the hostess chapter be declined with
thanks owing to pressure of business. To
this a merry war arose. Delegates with
the responsibilities of their constituent*
yet to be rid of bravely renounced
pleasure; those with care-free minds
longed for the outing, and with a plea
from Mrs. Voorhles the latter faction
won, but with the injunction that a ses
sion would be called at 6 o'clock sharp.
And at that hour the fair body was as
sembled, with amendments staring it ouc
of countenance with issues of divisional
import sandwiched. . ' '
The duplication of lost crosses of honor
met with sad defeat, and this In noble
strife between heart and head, for with
the desire to restore a lost "emblem there
arose the obstacle of an absent commit
tee on that matter, with no one* empow
ered to act. The rulings were remark
ably clear-headed and decisive through
the strain of sentiment which was upper
most, and the matter of duplicate crosses
was consigned to postponement.
Mrs. John 8. Reagan, wife of the last
member, of Jefferson Davis' Cabinet, and
Mrs. Braxton Bragg were made honorary
presidents. Mrs. Thomas Llndsey Wor
cester of Ohio proposed a vote of thanks
to Mrs. L. L Mann, a Northern woman,
who had given a burial ground for Con
federate soldiers at Chicago, the lot 600
by. 275 feet
With the question of appropriations for
monuments to heroes came long debates,
the ground at Shiloh to bo the chosen
spot.
A diversion severed the argument when
the California Division, If. D. C pre
sented Mrs. Augustine Smy the with a
silver loving cup, her surprise being com

cote, purporting to have been written
by O. M. Jones, the real estate man
â¢who committed suicide back of the
Greek Theater yesterday, was found by
the Coroner's deputies lying by the
â¢lde of the corpse. In the note Presi
dent Wheeler is blamed for the sui
cide's death. The note reads as fol
lows:
President Vheeler ha* thrown me down. â â
ââ him. I flic with carbolic acid, and mar
Wheeler meet a l!ke fate.
There was no signature attached to
this note, a mere scrawl having been
placed at the bottom. The note was
written on rough wrapping paper. It
was demonstrated to-day that the note
was intended as a hoax, perpetrated
by some persons before the arrival of
the Coroner's men on the scene of the
suicide. The handwriting In the note
Is entirely dissimilar to that in the

Jones, and which were found on his
person. The college authorities will

love affair and business reverses were
responsible for the suicide.

tinuous vaudeville upstairs in tho
Jinks room, however. Up there the
wits congregated and there^ were "do
ings" all the while.
Uncle George Bromley led with some
rare stories. Uncle's humor made the
younger element look ashamed. "You
can't tell a story to : beat > Uncle
George" was the verdict.

few the youths got buiy. 'The tales
were all new and they were being told

contributed were: Nat Landsburger,
Signer Carlo Gentili, Uda Waldrop, R.
S. Folger. L. J. Stillman (the poet). M.
de Leon of the University of California,

SIGHT OP BRITISH WARSHIPS
MAY CALM THE JAPANESE
- TOKIO, Oct. 7. â The coming visit to
Japanese waters of the British squad
ron commanded by -Vice , Admiral Sir
Gerald Noel, commander In chief of the
China station, will, it is expected, be
made the occasion soon after the rati
fication of peace of a grand naval review,
which, with Admiral Togo's triumphant
entry into the city, will offer a splen
did occasion for diverting tho people's
attention from the unsatisfactory terms
of the treaty. It is believed that the
authorities will do everything possible
to- utilize these events as demonstra
tions of the fact that the peace of Asia
is guarded by the two powerful allies.
American warships are expected to be
present at the naval review.
Many of those who allowed them
selves to be carried away by the tide
of dissatisfaction which- set in when
the peace terms became known here are
gradually becoming reconciled to the
situation.

JEWEL THIEVES
MAKE A HAUL
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 7.â An expert thief
took a casket of Jewels almost literally
from under the nose of Mrs. C. C. Riches
at the Hotel Rochester this evening and
got away with it. Mrs. Riches was alone
in her room and. was sitting near the
dresser, which stood near an open win
dow. She took her Jewel case out of her
trunk and in it placed the rings she was
wearing, leaving the casket on the
dresser. Turning she took up some sew
ing and in less than ten minutes later
had occasion to return to the dresser.
The Jewel case was gone. No one else
had been in the room and a thorough
search failed to disclose the casket.
Several persons on the street had seen a
man on a fire " escape, but had paid no
attention to him, thinking him an em
ploye of the hotel. The thief is believed
to have been watching Mrs. Riches, and
as soon as her back was turned he seized
her Jewelry. The property was worth
?300. . v.r
Miss Hannah Mansfield of Tucson.
Ariz., prominent in Arizona and Los An
geles society, was the victim of a thief
at the Hotel Van Nuys. A Jewel case
containing diamonds valued at more than
$500 was stolen from her room Tuesday.

EXPLAINS HIS
NEW CURATIVE
Yon Bearing" Tells. of Oper
ation of His Discovery
in Checking Tuberculosis
CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS
His Treatment of Disease
Has No Connection "With
the Antitoxin Principle
EL PASO. Texas, Oct. 7.â Dr. Danial
Munoz of Chihuahua claims to have dis
covered a serum for tha cure of consump
tion and the State Legislature will ap
propriate money to test it.
i PARIS. Oct. 7.â At the closing of thÂ»
International Tuberculosis Congress to
day. Professor yon Behring made a state
ment relative to his new curative prin
ciple for tuberculosis and it also was de
cided to hold the next congress at Wash
ington in 1908.
Professor Behrlng's statement attracted
much attention. Distinguished medical
men from many countries occupied tha
Platform and filled the salon of tna Grand
Palace. The Drofessor said:
"In the course of the last two years. I
recognized with certainty tha existenca
of a curative principle completely differ
ent from the antitoxin principle. Tnls
new curative principle plays an initial
role In the operation of the immunity de
rived from my bovo- vaccine, which has
proved effective against animal tuber
culosis during the past four years. This
curative principle reposes upon tha im
pregnation of the living cells of the or
ganism with a substance originating from
tubercoso virus, which substance I desig
nate T. C"
Professor Behring then gave a lengthy
technical description of how "T. c.~ was
introduced into the cellular orgraniam and
said it had already given marked results
In the treatment of animals. He ex
pressed" the confident belief that his re
searches would permit similar curative
results in humans. He added that ha
was unable to say how soon positive re
sults would be obtainable, but he felt
as certain that these results would be
attained as when he first announced his \u25a0
discovery of a new method for treating
diphtheria.
The American delegates were interested
listeners to the statement. Later they
â¢were asked whether the present state of
medical science held out the hope of a
permanent cure of tuberculosis. Dr. Law
rence Flick of Philadelphia said:
"The present state of medical science
holds out a good prospect of a permanent
dure for tuberculosis when the disease is
taken in its early stases. This, however,
is not through a specific remedy, but by
proper alienation and open air life, with
exercise, duly restricted. If the present
knowledge concerning the mean.-? of pre
venting tuberculosis was generally ap
plied it 13 safe to say that tuberculosis
would be stamped out of civilized coun
tries within a few years."
"RAFFLES" TURNS
AGAINST "PALS"
LONDON. Oct. 7. â Charles Fisher
("Raffles"), an American convict, now
serving a ten years' sentence of lm- ;
prisonment in England for burglary,
was the principal witness for the crown 1
at the- Westminster Police Court to-day
in a case against Talbot Bridge water.
describing himself as a medical spe
cialist; Lionel Peyton Holmes, William -'
Edward Shaw Kell and Elizabeth Fos
ter, said to be Bridge water's wife,
charging them with conspiracy and
with having forged the name of Mar
shal Fox. an American resident in Lon
don, to a check for $4095.
Fisher said ho was born In New York
and that he had served several sen
tences in America. Ho broke Jail la
Cincinnati in 1832 and escaped to Ens
land, but was rearrested and returned
to the United States on an extradition
warrant.- \u25a0
The case against the defendants dates
back to the summer of 1904. Bridge
water, it is charged, was tha originator,
of the plot. He is alleged to have paid,
attentions to a lady, the secretary oÂ£
Mr. Fox, and who Is said to hive In-*
stalled Fisher as a boarder in her housa
at Str eatham, a suburb of London, t
Fisher, It is said, secured wax Im
pressions of the keys of Fox's *afo and
the conspirators had a key mada from
this and got Fox's check book. Later,:
Fisher was arrested in connection with.
an office-breaking affair and sentenced;:
to ten years. The case has attracted
considerable attention from time to !
time, as the prisoners were .fcrousht up?
on remand. Recently Fisher turnedsj
King's evidence and confessed his ahar* J
in the Fox robbery to an Inspector oq
police in the Jail wher* ho Is workinrj
out his sentence.
Fisher's testimony to-day was an ex-*r>
haustivo disclosure of his alleged conÂ«-^j
nection with tho case on trial and his ""I
career of crime. Since comlnj to Eng-|f
land he has been convicted three times.* I
Including bis present sentence. He tes-4 j
tided that he was the accomplice of aS\
gang working in London and shadow-!'- 1
ing rich Americans and it is learned >J
that he was indirectly connected withral
the recent theft of a pearl necklacaH
from Christie's. Fisher said he never*'!
moved about without carrying wax focH
the taking of impressions of locks, andj* J
while not admitting that he was con-W
nected with other big robberies, it waaH
evident that he knew much about thtmH
He said he had turned King's evltlencu!
because he wished to lead a new life. 1 j
Bridgewater asserts that Fisher !wi
hired by the police and that the wholora
of his alleged confession is a PÂ°Hc|a|
plot. ? |

FIRE SPREADS
WITH RAPIDITY
Fifteen Business Houses in
New York City Arc Wiped
Out Within a- Few Hours
MANY XAH-EOW ESCAPES
Half a Dozen Firemen Are
Caught in a Back Draught
of Smoke, but Are llescued
NEW YORK. Oct 7.â Two* city blocks
burned over, fifteen business establish
ments destroyed, hundreds of tenement
dwellers forced to flee for safety from
their flame-threatened homes, one fireman
injured, a bwitehman burned, 250 fear- :
crazed horses roaming through crowded
streets for more than an hour and a dcs- ;
perate three-hour stuggle with the flames j
were the results of a ore that threatened
destruction to a large portion of the up
per East Side water front shortly after
midnight. The loss was JlOO.OOO.
Starting in a ragpicker's shop In One
Hundred and Eighth street, near First
avenue, the flames spread rapidly and
within a few minutes it was necessary to ;
tura in four alarms, and twenty-five en
gine companies, a flreboat and half a
dozen towboata were rushing to the scene
to combat with the flames, that were
sweeping southward. The block between
One Hundred and Eighth and One-Hun
dred and Seventh streets, composed of .
email buildings, was swept within a few
minutes, and flying embers had Ignited
the big lumber yards of J. Reber's Sons
& Co. From the lumber yards the tire
threatened the entire district. Half a
dozen firemen caught in a back draught
of flame and smoke when a lumber shed
collapsed were blinded and choked, but
with one exception all escaped serious in
jury. Pipeman O'Nell was struck by a
falling timber and fell unconscious. He
was rescued by his companions.
Michael Nehr and his wife, who lived
on the second floor of a two-story brick
building on the north side of One Hun
dred and Seventh street, had a narrow es
cape from, death and with difficulty were
rescued by the firemen. Nehr lost 1100
in cash. Â»ome jewelry and a box of rare
old coins, which he valued at $500.
The coal yard of Meyer Brothers, which
was in the path of the flames, was swept
by them. In the rear of the yard was a
stable where 250 horses were quartered.
The animals were turned loose T>y the po
lice and firemen, and for more than an
hour the frightened beasta rushed through \u25a0
the. crowded streets. Finally all were cap
tured.
Throughout the fire the wind, veering
to the north, carried great showers of
sparks southward, some as far as Nine
tieth street. These fell on the roofs of
tenements in their course and kept the
occupants in alarm for hours. When the
fire reached the north side of One Hun
dred and Sixth street the Italian" tenants
of a crowded tenement on the south side
of that street became panic-stricken and
rushed to the street, yelling in fright.
The police had difficulty in saving them
from injuring themselves.
It was three hours after the . fire had
started before the firemen had it under
controt The change in the wind enabled
the firemen to save Xrpm damage the line
of three, four and five story buildings on
'the east side of First avenue., between
One Hundred and Eighth - and One Hun
dred and Seventh streets. â¢ -
J^IDGE COLLECTS
CAMPAIGN FUNDS
Postoffice Clerks Assessed
Five Per Cent of Tliqir
Salaries.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 7.â The Civil
Service Commission is preparing to for
ward a circular letter to all Govern
ment employes warnlngf them against
campaign contributions as In violation
of the regulations. The letter Is like
those ordinarily circulated when elec
tion campaigns are in progress, but the
necessity for the warning was em
phasized by a discovery made by Com
missioner Greene when engaged recent
ly in Investigating the postmaster at
Goshen. 111., and his clerks. .
Greene reported to the commission
that when the clerks were under ex
amination they told ,hlm that' during
the campaign of 1903 they had con
tributed 6 per cent of their respective
salaries to the Republican State cam
paign fund and that the contributions
were made through United States Cir
cuit Judge Baker. As It did not appear
that it had been a recent offense, the
commission did not feel justified In
making a formal charge against Judge
Baker.
AMMONIA USED TO CHECK â¢
itAID UPON A POOLROOM
Squad of Officers Held at Bay ,fey
Fames \u25a0 for Three-Quarters of
an Hour. .
NEW YORK. Oct 7. â A squad of offi
cers was held In check; for three-auar
ter* of an hour yesterday by ammonia
while raiding an alleged poolroom in
Bond street.
The first door the raiders met was of
wood and was quickly demolished. Af
ter arresting the alleged' lookout and
another man they attacked the second
door with sledges and crowbars. While
they were smashing in the iron-bound
door they were sent reeling back by
the overpowering fumes .of ammonia
which came from under the door.
Leaving one man on guard, after fruit
less attempts to stand the fumes, the
rest entered the next building, went to
the roof and entered the window of the
place they wanted from the fire escape
through an iron-barred window. All
but four of the thirty men in the place
were allowed to. go. No trace of the
ammonia could be found.

CHAEGE OF MUEDEK
Still Sticks to His Story That
He Did Not Kill Lit
tle Waif.
CHICAGO, Oct. '.7.â Dr. Oliver B.
Hart, the millionaire's son, would-bÂ«
suicide and husband of a 16-year-old
wife, was formally charged to-day with
the murder of 10-year-old Irene Klo-.
kow, a waif from an industrial \u25a0; school,
whose father is a patient .in an insanei
asylum and whose mothsr cannot be
found. The doctor, who is said; to be
addicted to morphine and .cocaine,
gazed stupidly *t the walls of the
courtroom when arraigned to-day and
did not speak a word. ; He was repre
sented by counsel,, who agreed to a con
tinuance of ten days, asked for by the
police. . '.--\u25a0.: \u25a0 :
Before going Into", the 'courtroom -Dr.
Hart was questioned by police offlclala,
but he adhered to- his original- story
that the Klokow" girl, bad swallowed
morphine pills . by mistake and that he
had not attacked her. .\u25a0 The prisoner's
father arid father-in-law., residents oÂ«
St Louis, have both' arrived in Chicago
and are Interesting themselves in the
developments. ; ; . '- '
Dr Hart admitted to-day, that , he
gave the child bromldia chloral, HÂ«
said he gave the girl at least forty-five
drops in his futile efforts to_ resuscitate
her after she had j swallowed a largo
number of morphine' tablets, -thinking,
according to the doctor.' that they were,
saccharine pills. He followed^up the
-bromidia with at least eight j hypo
dermic injections of strychnia sulphate.
At least, to a physician, the bromide
given the child by ; Hart \u25a0 was ; a sub
stance known as "knock-out drops."

maUnee "girl's â¢ "idol."-Policeman'Collins
strode out of the hall. Chief Dinan and
the extra men at the Central station
watched him disappear up Kearny street.
:The policeman arrived at 109 South-Park
by way of an electric car. The wagon
was hitched to a telegraph pole. Police
man Collins approached from two side
streets and stealthily 4 surrounded the of
fending vehicle. When all was ready, he
grasped his trusty riot stick and swarmed
down on it. The wagon was captured
without even a show of resistance. It
must have seen Collins coming. â¢
The officer: mounted the sÂ«at and took
possession of the wagon in the*name of
Jerry Dinan. The capture was made with
out los of life and Collins was Justly,
proud; but a difficulty introduced itself.
How could he convey -the* vehicle to the
Hall of Justice?- â¢/.-' .: ?T". '-
"Have 'you a horse?" asked Collins of
Mike Shak, the alleged proprietor of the
perambulating restaurant. ,
"I have no horse," replied Shak, { "and
my wife is sick. The harness doesn't flt
her: very well anyhow."
"Foiled again," muttered Policeman
Collins. ...:â¢ j, ; {?. ' â¢-' '** ' ' ; "-'
Suddenly there was a commotion in nil
think' tank. "I- will -wheel the wagon to
the hall," he shouted. :; . ...
The' day was warm. When Policeman
Collins' feet sank into the" bitumen they
lodged to linger there. Perspiration was
doing Niagara stunts* from his' brow, but
he pushed on? The weight of the cart in
creased 2043 pounds at each step, but Col
lins'was in the race to stick. L.ou Dillon
would have looked like the. tail end of a
funeral that day. ....
At the corner- of Third and Mission
streets an idea sprouted in"; the massive;
brain . of Collins. - A Third street car was
passing. . â¢ \u25a0. \u25a0. .
"Halt!" shouted Collins. .The motorman
turned off the Juice I and -.stood !at' atten
tion, waiting orders. , ', :.f-.
Policeman Collins wheeled, the ham
burger wagon, to, the "rear, of the car
and fastened - the : shafts ;, to; it.; He
cUmbed . on . the seat, and,, in Billy
Jordan-like tones shouted; "Let.'er go!"
She went. Along. Kearny street the
car made record time with her !tow.
. Just as Chief Dinan was ithinkirigof
sending ouf a ' rescue party 'there was
a sound of rattling wheels â¢ on"'Mer
chant street. Heads were popped out
of windows. As .the. Petaluma'corre
spondent says, ,"All was < excitement."
Cheers shook the "hall as Collins dasrhed
up with his capture. He wheeled the
vehicle before the' Chief and saluted. '.
"I spotted the enemy, and it. was my
meat;" "he said modestly. .;\u25a0 â¢ â¢/ .Â« -:\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0)'
That closed the incident, but in days

STRIKES HARD
AT RACE TRACK
Judge Hunt Throws Out An
. ,swer of Jocke^Club ; and
Makes Caustic Comment
OEDINANCE QUESTIONED
. _ â Â« â
Says Local Law Gives Corpo
ration a Monopoly on Im-i
moral Line of Business
-The New -California -Jockey Club is
powerless , to prevent the communication
of. the results \of races held at its courses
to persons outside of the Inclosure, near
or far.' ; Superior Judge Hunt so decided
yesterday in sustaining a demurrer to the
answer of the Jockey club to the suit in
stituted against It by George W. Sanfa-
Bon, who | sued to recover 11810 20 damages
for alleged ejectment from the
Eineryville, track. .
, In; answer. ; to; the complaint .the Jockey
club - admitted ': that it had caused the
ejectment of :; Banf asori. from the track,
but | sought to) Justify \ its action on the
ground that he was "flashing" the results
of -races to certain bookmakers in San
Fraiicisco.l who, v in . violation of the,ordin
ance that- provides that"- pools '; may be
sold alone within ' racetrack, lncloeures,
were * conducting 'poolrooms", in this city.
Judge Hunt holds that this is no defense
to ' the? action -and sustains the plaintiffs
demurrer to -the answer. ;:' The result, Is
. that | Sanfason must now demonstrate to
the court the actual damages he has sus
tained and take Judgment accordingly., ..
' ' Judge Hunt manifests email . patience
<with. the-San." Francisco' ordinance pro
hibiting : poolselling outside of . racetrack
inclosures, saying that as it has been held
that any j wager , upon a horse race is
against good morals, it may. be assuxned
that the i ordinance in : question was , not
intended 'to .discourage, betting on ; horse
races/ but rather to .localize it and secure
to* the proprietors ]of \u25a0 inclosed j racetracks
the monopoly of that privilege,

- "It will. be observed that the ordinance

-â¢ "Whether: the word 'immoraf* -in the

quential,' for ; in neither of these senses
can it be held that pne who is violating
or * has violated â¢a^ local ordinance is an
'immoral person.'-//
; "The neglect of 'a property owner after

sewer constitutes 'a .violation of *an or
dinance.-of the of this mu
nicipality and is punishable by. fine or Im
prisonment, or . both, : and the same pen
alty, is visited upon one who. spits on the
.sidewalk, ,yet , neither, of such offender*
would thereby become /immoral persons,*
nor. could ; : they ; be denied admission to a
theater on either of these grounds.
' -VBut the ordinance in 'question 'had no
operation or effect' outside, of this mu
nicipality. : Whatever - may be the local
regulations pertaining' to horse races run
in' this city and " county, such^ regulations
have no application to. races run in an
other county, hence even if it were as
sumed that the â¢: violation -of an \u25a0 ordinance
of ..< this " municipality, . committed within
the municipality, thereby. : made /the i of

EMMONS' WIFE
CRIES IN COURT
Bitter Words of Assistant
Prosecutor Bring Tears to
Eyes , of Boodler's Spouse
INCIDENT IS DRAMATIC
(Lawyer Declares Woman
j 3lated to Dishonored Man
Should Secure a Divorce
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 7.â The first step
toward the final submission of the case
of former Senator E. J. Emmons,
charged with bribery in connection
with the investigation of building and
loan associations, was taken ' this
â¢morning when Charles T. Jones, asso-
J elate counsel for the prosecution,
opened his argument against the ac
cused man. Jones did not .finish his
argument to the jury, but will take up
his discourse 'next Monday morning
â¢when court reconvenes. _
A rather dramatic incident was , de
veloped by Jones in the earlier staged
of his argument, in which he broke
the spirit of the wife of the accused
former Senator, from Kern, and made
her, for the first time since the legis
lative scandal, shed tears in public.
Jones had been reviewing the weight
of the testimony against the" accused
man, as the prosecution viewed it. and
in the course of an impassioned-address
to the jury he declared that the wife
of a man in the defendant's' position,
charged with such an offense .as Em
mons, should divorce. him, to the end
that "no" progeny should spring from
his loins to be marked as the off
spring of a man who had seriously of
fended."
Jones was. in thunderous voice and
he hurled his broadside with all the
vigor at his command. Mrs. Emmons
was sitting in the seat she has :oc
cupled throughout the trial, back of
her husband, and when Jones made his
declaration she burst into tears."; ilt
was several minutes before she- could
recover her- composure. and resume. the
stoical attitude, she has maintained
from the, very day her husband, was
first accused. ' \. \u25a0-.
Jones opened his argument with the
statement that he wanted" to thank the
opposing; counsel, headed by Grove L.
Johnson, for the/ fairness with which
the trial .had been carried /on- by the
opposing "side.
He; took : occasion' to deny, some \u25a0 ru
mors which he said had . been â¢ circu
lated to the' effect; that "he : was em
ployed Jn, the. prosecution: by the Con
tinental building and Loan Association,
declaring that he had been engaged
by District Attorney A. M. Seymour to
act for the. people.
Jones 'extolled. Seymour for the-ac
tion the latter took -before the Senat6
investigating committee in^ refusing to
permit any of ' the accused Senators to
give, testimony under oath, as to have
done so would have been to * relieve
them of prosecution for the offensa
with which they v were charged.
. Jones then went into an analysis of.
the testimony adduced, and -at . every
point, branded the' defendant guilty as
charged In the' indictment by the
Grand , Jury. . , . . - .
When the noon recess was reached
Jones had. not finished and an adjourn
ment was taken until hat Monday
morning. . \u25a0 -- â¢'â¢ -\u25a0 \u25a0

M. Weintraub,, president of the Wein

has" sworn'to warrants,for ; the 'arrest on
charges of grand 'larceny "and -receiving
stolen goods, respectively, ~oX D. and H.
Weintraub, whom he brought here re
cently from. Roumania and set ; up .In
business, believing them to ; be his half

ment now that he does not believe the ar
rested men are his half brothers at all,
but that he is the v*ctim ''of an imposi
tion. His: half- brothers were'bom, after
he left - Roumania,, ht says, arid the men 1
who came : hero .as yuch ; are â¢ both fair,
while he is dark. He declares he believes
a job has 'been: put up on : him. '
D. and H. Weintraub had a tailor shop
at 102S Market street. , : They were arrested
yesterday 3 afternoon by Detective Harry
Braig. The former was- booked on a.
charge of grand ", larceny and the latter
on a chargeof receiving stolen goods, r
M. Weintraub says the two defendants
were brought here from Roumania by
him about eleven , months "ago and \u25a0 he
started .them in business. He says that
they "hare cost him. in" the'- neighborhood
of 512,000 since then.' They have been con
sorting with dissolute women and spend
ing: the money on wine 'and ; clothes for
these women,- he alleges. When' he be
came aware of the mannerln .which they
were acting he closed up the tailor shop.
When he . examined the ' stock ,he [ dlscov-; :
ered that a large number/ of /dressl silk '
and. silk vest patterns. were missing.' and |
he made an investigation .which 'disclosed
tho^ fact ~ that - D.V*>Welntra.ub:.had "'.stolen,
the '. goods ! , from } the"' shop^ apd ; hadr'car-
ried them to the'rboinsiof , ll.v Weintraub

"were' recovered .from. :H.-;: H.- ; Welntraub's
room he decided â¢ to V notify they police
and the arrest of the two defendants;fol
lowed. 7 -. ... . . .-; -:.,.>; " .
" In speaking of the .matter yesterday.
M. Weintraub said:. "I would, not have
had my half brothers arrested if it had
not been for the fact that after swindling
me out of all .that .money and "after ; I
had .closed 'â¢ up, the â¢ shop, :. they called 1 at
my house during my absence apd cut in

NEGOTIATIONS
TO BE RESUMED
LONDON, Oct. 1. â The negotiations
respecting their spheres of influence in
Afghanistan pending . between Great
Britain and Russia when -the Russo^
Japanese war broke out will be resumed.
should Russia be. willing,' of which
there seems to be no doubt. The Brit
ish : Government is anxious that ques
tions which caused uneasiness in the
past should again be the subject of
friendly discussions between the diplo
mats of the two Governments. Great
Britain has 'already taken steps to this
end.
An official of the Foreign Office says
It is rather premature to speak of the
negotiations, but he Intimated that the
Government had taken the initiative In
looking to a resumption of the exchange
of views. The Government had always
hoped, the official added, that the nego
tiations would be resumed, and realized
that the present was the most opportune
time, aa^ the peoples -of the two coun
tries recognized that it was to their mu
tual . benefit that the Questions In dis
pute: be amicably settled. The negotia
tions which are about to be resumed
have a particular reference to Afghanis
tan, .where . each " desires that the other
Government guarantees not to extend its
sphere , of i Influence. Russia has shown
a desire to* reach an understanding by
curbing the aggressive policies of her
border Governors. This has created a
good impression in Great Britain.
Respecting the report that Great Britain
is willing to recognize" Russia's special
privileges in South Turkey in return for
Russian assurance of non-aggressive pol
icy, on the Indian frontier, it is given out
that the question has not been discussed
officially. It is possible, however, that
Great Britain is waiting. for such a sug
gestion to come ; from \u25a0_ Russia, s when ; it
might receive favorable consideration.'
Great Britain's . policy in ; regard to Con
stantinople Is dominated by consideration
for; the security, of 'the highway to India.
With the safety . of j India guaranteed by
the Anglo- Japanese treaty and an under
standing with ; Russia; there will be -no
reason- to; fear the: presence of Russia on
the' Bosphorus. ISQfIJHsgS
'- Great*. Britain has also to offer in ex

Indian possessions her support in obtain

LOWELL MAKES
A HARD FIGHT
Polytechnic Kickers . Have
All They Can Do to Score
One Touchdown and Win
CLOSE DECISION HELPS
Referee Relieves . Pierce of
the Ball, Claimijig That
the Latter Is Off Side
The showing made by the Lowell
High School against Polytechnic yes
terday afternoon was a big surprise.
The Polytechnic players went on the
field with the idea that the game was
to be theirs by a score of about 15-0.
but they were doomed to disappoint
ment.
The Lowell players held their op
ponents down to a score of 5-0, and
outclassed the wearers of the black
and red at many stages of the game.
Lowell's left half. Giberson. was the
star of the day and did more for his
team in yards gained than Garibaldi.
Polytechnic made the only touchdown
in the first half, when a punt from
Saunders was fumbled by a Lowell
man. Lowell lost the ball on downs,
and then bucking by Garibaldi and
Edwards forced the ball over the line.
â¢In the second half Lowell players
surpassed all of their former efforts
in outclassing their opponents. From
Lowell's twenty-yard line to Poly
technic* five was the record the Lowell
boys made for themselves.
With only five more yards to gain,
Lowell was relieved of the ball on thÂ«
next play by the referee, who said
Pierce of Lowell was off side. â¢ With
the ball so near Poly's goal it Is al
most certain that Lowell would have
tied the score. When this ruling came
from the referee the Lowell boys were
not inclined to continue the game.
Thlx game, like the Poly-Lick one.
is under protest, due to the alleged
professionalism of John Garibaldi, so
the Lowell players still have a chance
to beat their rivals. The teams lined

CALIFORNIA KICKERS
FAIL TO GET A POINT
CARDINAL DOWNS SOLDIERS
Willamette Eleven
Puts Up Strong
Defense. â¢
The hearts of those who grow hoarse j
6b.outing â¢ 'Calif ornia" grew faint on the
gridiron at Berkeley yesterday, when
Willamette kept the blue and gold from
scoring and threatened to make a touch
down herself. In view of the fact that
the lads with the cardinal hosiery made j
a sccre of 12 to 0 against the youngsters :
from the Webfoot State a week ago, .
those who "dope" football on results were '
\u25ba/eacy to predict ao easy victory for Stan
ford in the great game. The veterans
who witnessed the contest realized, how- â¢
ever, that California is beginning to. show
tigns of genuine football ability. j
Coach Knibbs has developed more speed '
for a starter In the blue and gold outfit
ThftTi It ever had before. The chap who
helped to win Dartmouth's great victories
knows what is the prime requisiteâ and
there Is a tip for you, Mr. Lanagan. |
In yesterday's struggle the men from ,
Rainland could have won had they pos- j
sessefi the speed. California could have
won had the ball not been fumbled. As
it was, the pigskin drifted back and forth
across the center line for a twenty-min
ute and a Sfteen-mlnute half without se- ,
rious danger to either goaL There were
sporadic instances of good playing on
both sides, but the great redeeming fea- \
ture of the contest was California's epeed.
Two elevens played for the blue and
gold Curing the game. There was natur
ally a lack of cohesion in the play, as
might be expected when there are so
many men in the. team. Jordan pjayed a
rattling good left end for the home eleven
and Enedigar at half made things par
ticularly dangerous for the visitors. Kit
trelle is showing remarkable improve
ment over his work of last year. Now
that h* knows he was not born to be a
quarterback he can undoubtedly do some
;hins at end. He is grit clear through
and the kind of chap from which success
ful teams should be constructed. The rest
of the cast furnished excellent support
except when they fumbled.
. Bishop for "Willamette was a hard nut
3--> crack. He was practically always good
: jT a gain and madeâ Pete Smith caysâ
about five out of every six tackles re
.-orded in favor of his team. The rest of
the eleven was too slow to take advan
tage of its opportunities. The weather
was hot and the condition of the Orego
nians was poor.
California should feel highly elated over
the numerous signs of future greatness
in the infant that is being cultivated into
a husky to "give 'em the ax" on Novem
ber 1L Booth surpassed at quarter.
Fumbling and penalizations were frequent
yesterday. The interference on both sides
was poor. Tho tackling was too high to
attain the best results. The Lewis and
Oiarkers excelled in punting. Pete Smith
DfSc'ated as referee and Kenneth Hamil
ton as umpire. A feature of the spectacle
was Manager Decoto's driving of di
minutive human gophers out of the grand
stand. The line-up was Â«s follows: - -,

DAN PATCH PACES A MILE IN 1:55 1-4
Stanford Rolls Up a
Large Score of
Fifty-One.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 7,â
The contest between the Fifteenth In
fantry from Monterey and the football
eleven of the Stanford University proved
a walkover for the varsity. They were
able to score 51 to their opponents' goose
egg with ridiculous ease. At the comple
tion of the game and for the greater part
of the contest the squad which represent
ed the cardinal was composed largely of
the second and third elevens, which of lato j
have suffered defeat repeatedly before the
. freshman squad.
Considering the slight resistance with
which the varsity backs met when they
advanced against the bluccoats, it would '
be difficult to estimate whether the squad â¢
has gained much in form In the past I
week. The contest has demonstrated,
however, that in "Kenny" Fenton and |
| Vandervoort the cardinal has two invalu
j able substitutes for the positions of quar-
I terback and left hal/, respectively, if not
men for the first' team. Vandervoort, a
sophomore and classmate of Fenton,
made In the first half four touchdowns,
i breaking loose from the mix-up in each
I case and making sensational gains of
j from ten to forty yards." Chalmers and
i Dole were responsible for the remainder
jof the scoring in this half, making a
i touchdown each.
Stanford opened matters in the first
I half and held the soldiers for downs.
f Vandervoort took the spheroid and made
la sensational sprint of forty yards for a
i touchdown. Fenton annexed the goal and
i the score read 2S-0. Dole scored the next
| touchdown, but failed to kick the goal.
' Score S3-0. The half ended shortly after,
| with the ball in the possession of the car
| dinal. The second spasm was largely a
j repetition of the first half, the cardinal:
i eleven being composed .principally of
third team candidates. The line-up was:
Stanfordâ Koerner, Stanford and Vail,
right end;. Tomasini and Brenner, right
tackle; Lane and Frizzell, right guard;
Bogle, ilyers and Molflno, center,;
Thompson. Wild and Cox. left guard;
Pemberton, Horton,' Blood and Bee, left
tackle: Marks, Lyon and Ray, left end;
Fenton, Laumeister and Dolg, quarter;
Chalmers and Goldsmith, right half; Van-,
dervoort. Dole and Ritchie, left half;
Crow and S. B. Thompson, fullback.
Soldiersâ Gillispie, right end; Bixler, right
tackle; Portwood, right guard; Bates,
center; Anderson, left guard; Pernior, left
tackle; Elliott, left end; Waugh. quarter:
McLaugblin, right hajf; Madison, left
j half; Gaston, fullback.
STA>-FORD BABES WIS AGAIN.
University of Pacific Eleven Is Beaten,
IS to O.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 7.â
The fresliman eleven to-day won from
the aggregation of the University of
the Pacific by a score of 15 to 0 in
a hard-fought tussle. The cardinal
Ifne "was constantly shifted' and "all
promising candidates received a trial.
The visitors proved themselves formi
dable opponents and every touchdown
of the youngsters was well earned.
Two of the tallies occurred In the first
half and the other was made in the
last thirty seconds of the second half.
The first scoring was done in - the
period of eleven minutes from the
time the ball was first put Into play
and was finally carried over the line '
by Crawford; right tackle. Ho failed
to convert the goal Into an additional
point. ' Along near the end of this
half Torney. left half, made a dash
of thirty yards for a gain of five points.
The goal was again missed. In the last
half the visitors took a brace and pro
ceeded to rush matters. They kept the
ball well in the cardinal territory, but
were unable to score. Then the fresh
men took a Jolt and in turn carried
matters into their -opponents' field,
scoring in the last few remaining sec
onds. The lineup was as follows:

When the Seals began to get wised
up to the kind that Tozier was tossing
yesterday afternoon they
but little difficulty in walloping? enough
runs home to carry them through with
out further worry. As a /sort of stimu
lant' they waded in" during the first
inning and what happened, to. the; Los^
Angeles twirler was awful ' to tell.
Three good solid wallops produced, as
many runs. The hitting was \u25a0 done' f by
Hildebrand, Householder and ( Irwln.
Hilde started the fireworks by planting
a sizzling three-cushioner away out to
the left garden : and the others came
back with a vengeance.
From the way in which the Angels,
begin to office up to - Dick Williams'
twists in the opening spasm it looked
as if they would give the big blonde
slabster a good time before the full
nine rounds-had, been' reeled off. But
Dick began to "settle down after the
stormy firsthand, aided by good sup-r
port, he pitched shutout ball till the
eighth, when Mohler's error and Cra
vath's double against the right field
fence produced another run.
Hildebrand was the lest man with
the bat. He clouted the leather for a
double and a triple out of three trips
to the rubber. Hilde has hot been stick
ing with any great success lately, but
his work yesterday made Wie fans yell
with glee. The score: - ,

KELLY IS THE BIG HERO.
Grnba n Hot Liner That Cuts Off Sev
eral Runs.
SEATTLE. Oct. ,7.â lt , was - not on
account of hits that Seattle lost the
game to-day, for they got theirs, but
pure hard luck! In hitting. Into double
plays:at the proper, time. In the sev
enth Inning .Kelly saved the \ day for
Graham by spearing "a line hit with
one hand, â¢ taking It ..hot from
Hall's bat. His catch % saved two
bases. He then completed a _ double
play . by tossing "the ball ' to
Jloskiman, for the hit . appeared so
safe that all runners were moving.
Had Kelly failed In his effort a.differ
ent, story would have been told , In. the
score. Graham was given splendid sup
port by the visitors. : -In the third In-,
ning they bunched hits on Miller so
that two runs f'.' t werÂ«i chased home.; It
was not until the ninth inning that
Graham allowed more than, one- hit to
an Inning- .The last inhing was played'
mid /a downpour,: of {rain and gave
Seattle its only run. , Score: ."-â¢"\u25a0

No other disease causes sucH wide-spread . suffering as Rheumatism. It is
rackiiig : and excrutiating torture, and so thorpuglily dominates the system that its victims
are complete slaves to pain. It afflicts the very young as well as those of middle life and
old age; showing that it is not only an acquired disease, but also a hereditery trouble.
Rheumatism is usually brought ! on by indigestion, Stomach troubles^eak Kidneys, "
torpid Liver and general sluggish condition of the system. The natural refuse matter of
the body, which should be carried off by the usual avenues of natee are leftin the system
to sour- and form uric acid and other irritating poisons,^ which are absorbed into the.blood.
This vital stream then becomes ; and unfit for - nourishing the : body , and as it \u25a0 circulates;
to xth6- different j)arts, the; poisons and acids ; with which it Is loaded come in- contact
