mentioned for permanent chairman.
Five Hearst - delegates from Massa

Twenty-seven of the thirty- two dele

as they believe there is a chance for

make a speech putting Olney's name

Men from the Far West have been
making quite an active 'canvass for
former Senator George Turner for
Vice-President, and Marshall Field of
Chicago, Benjamin F. Shively of Indi
ane, John Kern of the same State, Dav
id R. .Francis of Missouri. David S.
Rose of Wisconsin and John Sharp
Williams of Mississippi are among
those whose names are mentioned In
connection with the second place on
the ticket, but as long as there is
doubt about who*will head the ticket
no great excitement can be worked up
over the second - place. *
There have developed two distinct
situations without regard to candi
dates. One is a desire to "mix it up"
and have a convention which- wil! ; be
uncertain up to the last moment. The
other is a "band-wagon" contingent
that wants the problem settled as soon
as possible and to get close to the driv
er. Thus it happens that delegations
with favorite sons are among those
who v.-ould like to prolong the contest
and be among the first to swing for
the winning man. Some uninstructed
delegations would ba glad of the op
portunity to make the Presidential can
didate, if they vere cure. they could
pick the winner. Naturally the "band-
Senator German is not coming to the
convention and will not enter into a
scramble for the nomination, nor.v.ill
he be a party to a movement to defeat
the nomination of Parker for the bene
fit of some other man â McClellan or
Cleveland, for instance.
GORMAN HOLDS ALOOF.
This has been a Gorman dav! All
the elements that could be used to
aid the Maryland Senator were put
forth. His friends have â¢ been in evi
dence and the strongest arguments
brought to bear to show that he ought
to be named. The Congressional Influ
ence has been a factor, and Senators
and Representatives and Congressional
employes, talking and working for
Gorman, have given evidence of the
popularity of the Maryland Senator
among those who know him.
ST. LOUIS, July 3.â It looks like Par
ker. N'ine out of every ten men who
have been closely watching the situa
tion believe that Parker will be nomi-~
nated on the second or not later than
the third ballot. At the same time
there is enough uncertainty to make the
dtuation Interesting. The balloting is
five days away, and a great deal may
occur* !n/ that time, with many un
pledged and uninstructed delegates,
Â¦with delegations that will consider
their Instructions fulfilled after one or
two ballots, coupled with the fact that
there Is & strong undercurrent against
the leading candidate. If the opposi
tion to Judge Parker had the elements
of cohesion he could be defeated, but
the difficulty of mixing milk and water
Is not yet solved.
If not Parker, then Gorman, or â
remotelyâ Cleveland.
'The Presidential situation has been
sufficiently interesting to keep the
Vice-Presidency and; the- platform
somewhat in the background," although
both have received consideration.
Many drafts of alle^ed^ platforms have
been brought to the city, and several
prominent Democrats are said to have
the real thing, but it is. said that- the
platform "will.. be made in committee
and after a sharp contest. , It Is. known
that Senator, Gorman made a" draft of

FIGHT OVER PLATFORM
Soon after Bryan's \ arrival in St.
Louis there was some talk about Judge
Gray, mainly because ,a . report had
been circulated that the Nebraska man
.v/ould support Cray in preference to
any other candidate. Occasionally the
name of Joseph Folk Is heard, but it
is apparent that Missouri Democrats
do not want any further prominence
given to the young Missouri attorney.
The Cleveland talk has been on the
wane, but there is quite a" contingent
that is watching the situation with
the hope that a condition may . arise
which will make Cleveland's nomina
tion advisable. This could j not ! be
brought about except after an exciting
and bitter struggle.
During the day there was some talk
about Mayor McClellan, but It is recog
nized that his, birth in Germany would
supply, a small element. of uncertainty,
while a'still greater factor is the solid
delegation of Xew York State support
ing another candidate. "
Of all the candidates suggested, Par
ker teems more objectionable to Bryan
and Hearst than any other man, Cleve
land alone ezcepted. Yet several of
the delegations under instructions for
Hearst freely announce their prefer
ence for Parker and expect to vote for
him on the second ballot.
wagon" delegates are now counted for
Parker, but if it were possible^to show
them another man thev would be
willing to support him.
The opponents of Judge Parker raise
a number of objections. Hill, as his
political backer, and August Belmorrt,
as representative of the business inter
ests behind him, are said to be un
pleasant for many delegates. The op
position of Tammany -in New York and
of Hearst and Bryan In other portions
of the- country has some effect.

DEMOCRATS WHOSE XA3IES ARE PROMINENT IX THE POLITICAL NEWS FROM < ST. LOUIS.
The Norge sailed from Copenhagen on June 22. She was last sighted off the Butt of Lewis (the north
ernmost point of the Hebrides Islands) on "June 27. Rockall, the islet on which she struck/is about 200 miles
west of the Hebrides. It is a dangerous reef with a rock about 75 feet above water.
The Norge, which has been in the Copenhafrcu-Xo'w York service on the Scandinavian-American line
for a number of years, was an iron vessel of 333S tons gross and 2121 tons net. Her principal dimensions were:
Length 340 feet, breadth 40 feet, depth 25 feet. The Norge was built at Glasgow by Stephen & Sons in 1881,
when she was christened Picter de Cdnin'ck. When she was purchased by the United States company at
Copenhagen she was renamed the Norge. The vessel .was equipped with Â»ix water-tight bulkheads.
"Four or fivewere in. the boat into which I got and we cleared the ship. Luckily for us, in our party was
the only seaman from the Norge who-. escaped, and he was able to navigate our little boat. We saw two
other boats capsize, owing to the heavy sea and because no one could navigate them. We made straight
away .and when we last saw the Norge a large number of emigrants were on the deck. Captain Gundel stood
on the bridge. Dozens of passengers had jumped into the sea. They wore life belts but Â»vere drowned before
our eyes. After twenty-four hours the Salvia bore down and picked us up. % About 700 persons must have been
drowned." J
According to the . survivors, the moment the vessel struck the engines were reversed and the Noree came
back into deep water. The hole in her bows was so large, however, that she began to fill rapidly. The vessel's
light boats were swung over the sides rapidly, and the women and children were put into them first. There
was a heavy 'sea running and in lowering the boats all but two of them were smashed.

SURVIVORS SEE TWO OTHER BOATS CAPSIZE.
thing serious had occurred and I made a dash below to gather up my few belongings. Scores were rushing oa
deck and the hatchway was crowded with emigrants. They were launching boats and rushing into them, but
there was no panic. ' â¢ ; ?yl
In the sea by this time was a mass of struggling men, women and children, gasping and choking from the
effects of the water. The boat rowed clear of these and'just as she drew away the Norge went down. Peter
Nelson, one of thei survivors described as a young American, said:
"For several hours we rowed in company with the boats, but the strong tide drifted us away from the
others and nothing has been seen of them since. The Salvia picked k us up and we were well cared for on board
the trawler. All of us lost our entire belongings. We had no time in that 6erce fight for life to think of
anything but the getting of seats in the boats."
The only hope, except for those known to have escaped, is that some of the emigrants might have been
washed upon the barren reef. Their chance of being rescued even then is practically nil, for vessels sailing the
North Atlantic give Rockall a wide berth.
The news of this disaster, which, it is feared, in its death record is greater than any previous tragedy
of the Atlantic, came with the arrival to-night of the Salvia at her home port, the fishing town of Grimsby. The
Salvia had been on a fortnight's cruise around the Hebrides. By a lucky chance she steamed further west
than is usual for trawlers and fell in with the survivors of the Norge, who for twenty-four hours had been
tossed about in a small'boat on the rough waters of the North Atlantic. The survivors were taken aboard the
Salvia and were landed at Grimsby to-night. One of them said:
"We left Copenhagen on June 22. There were 700 emigrants-^Norwegians, Swedes, Danes and Finnsâ
on board. The crew numbered about eighty. AH went well until June 28. I lay in my bunk waiting for
breakfast. We heard a little bump, then another bump, and then I rushed on deck. I saw at once that some-
MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.
Three boatloads got safely away"from'tlie'*Â§Jde*''of "the sinking snip, and many of the emigrants wto
were left on board, seizing life belts, threw themselves into the sea and were drowned. Captain Gundel, so say
the survivors, stood oa the bridge of the doomed vessel until it could be seen no more.
The Norge foundered suddenly and some six hundred terrified emigrants were thrown into the water
or. drawn down with the sinking -ship. Those who could swim tried to reach the boats, but these were already
too full, and their occupants beat off the drowning wretches with oars.
The boats kept together for some hours. Practically all of their occupants were passengers who were
not used to handling such craft. The boat occupied by the survivors and which landed at Grimsby was a
lifeboat. The fate of the other two boats is unknown. The lifeboat made the faster progress and fell in with the
steam trawler Salvia. ' , â¢ '
The rescue of those on the lifeboat took place on the morning of June 29, the survivors consisting of
twenty men, one of them a seaman, six women and a girl. One of the survivors said that when he got on deck
the Norge was half'submereed and was rapidly getting lower in the water. Half mad with fright, the survivor3
all struggled for places in the boats. They fought their way to the big lifeboat and an officer stowed in the
six women and the girl and then told the men to get in. The officer then took charge and got the boat away
from the side of the Norge. Seeing that the craft was already overloaded, the officer with great heroism
jumped into the water and tried to board another boat which was not so crowded. He failed and was drowned.
PASSENGERS LEAP TO CERTAIN DEATH IN THE SEA.
LONDON, July 3.â More than 700 Danish and Norwej?ian emigrants, bound for New York, are be
lieved to have been drowned in the North Atlantic on June 28. Of nearly 800 on board the Danish steamship
Norge, which left Copenhagen on June 22, only 27 are known to be alive, and for the rest no hope is held out.
When last seen the Norge was sinking where she struck on the Isle of Rockall. whose isolated peak raises
itself from a deadly Atlantic reef 290 miles off the west coast of Scotland.
Early on the morning of last Tuesday the Norge, which was out of her course in heavy weather, struck
the Rockall reef, which in the distance looks like a ship under full sail. The Norge was quickly backed off,
but the heavy seas poured in through a rent in her bows. The emigrants, who were then awaiting breakfast
below, ran on deck. The hatchways were scarcely built for these hundreds of souls and soon became clogged.
The Norge quickly began to go down by_the head. Eight boats were lowered and into these the women and
children were hurriedly put. Â¦ Si* oi the, boats smashed against the side of the Norge and their helpless inmates
were caught up by. the heavy seas.

Bordeaux, Fance, has retained its pre
eminence as the prune center of the
world is told In the consular report' of
Albion W. Tourgee, American Consul,
who says:
"The failure of the prune crop would
have entailed very serious consequen

the large stock of California prunes
which was held over from last year
and the sagacious enterprise of French
dealers in securing early control of
this year's crop on our Pacific coast.
Bordeaux Is really, the center of- the
prune trade of the world. The methods
of preparing this fruit here are so su
perior to the manipulation it receives
elsewhere that California prunes
brought here repacked maintain
the superiority over French prunes and
are exported in large quantities to the
United States, where they compete
successfully with the American fruit,
which has not incurred the cost of dou
ble exportation. In 1903, for -instance,
theje were almost no prunes raised In
this regionâ probably not one-twentieth
of the normal crop. The deficit was
supplied by the importation of prunes
grown In California and Oregon. This
fact I know from having been required
to make inspections of the condition
of such importations and afterward to
give testimony in litigation resulting
from controversies over the quality and
salable character of such prunes.
"Though the prune crop of this re
gion was so small as to be almost neg
lible, the quantity in the markets of
the world not being large enough, in
fact, to supply the home demand, the
eXport of French prunes was not ma
terially lessened.

the presentation of the name of

in all probability it would not make an
aggressive campaign In the interest of
the former President. This decision
was agreed upon at a meeting held on
the train as it approached St. Louis.
The meeting was held for the purpose
of organizing, but also took up the
question of policy with reference to
Cleveland. Seventeen of the twenty
fcur delegates are for Cleveland, but
they decided not to press his name un
less there should appear to be a good
prospect of his nomination.
Seven of the New Jersey delegates
are for Parker, but no effort has been
made to reach a decision as to the can
didate in case a definite conclusion not
to present Cleveland's name is reached.
Former Comptroller Eckels, who held
office under Cleveland, also declined to
state whether Cleveland's name would
be presented.

mal nomination, but I am sure that
when Cleveland's name is mentioned
it will be received with enthusiasm."

It was said that the hearing of the

The Hopkins faction of the Illinois

are made against two of the delegates
at large. John P. Hopkins and Ben T.

it being alleged that the Hopkins

ST. LOUIS, July 3.â Some of the
Hearst de'.esates have been in confer
ence with Gorman's friends and have
assured them that the Maryland Sen
ator had supporters among the Hearst
men. California and South Dakota are
two States which have extended hope
to the Gorman managers.
A conference of prominent delegates
opposing the nomination of Judge Par
ker was held to-night at the apartment
of National Committeeman Johnson of
Kansas. A complete canvass of the sit
uation was made and a determination
to impress upon the various delegates
the importance, of holding the "favor

participants express the opinion that
if this system is followed Parker's vote
on the first ballot can be held below
a majority and his nomination pre
vented in the end.

Tarpey is great on literature â cam
paign boomshells in type. As soon as
he assumed command he opened the
floodgates of his pamphlet bureau and
the streets and corridors are aflutter
with these recordations of the Hearst
accomplishments. The first of the is
sue is small and modest and sets forth
in calm and quiet style that through
the efforts of Hearst the fuel gas trust
was killed, the ice trust slain, the
Ramapo water grab assassinated, the
coal trust murdered, the shipyards
trust throttled, the illuminating gas
trust asphyxiated, the Seventh Nation
al Bank wreckers dungeoned and Sher
iff Guden hurled from the high plnacle
of office. By an excusable oversight
the pamphlet fails to state whether
Sheriff Guden Is from New York or Po
dunk, how badly he was bruised at the
pinacle's base or in whose tall timber (
he is now encamped.
This pamphlet, unembellished and
alone, Is a powerful document, but a
second one raises an incongruity that
seriously reflects upon the judgment
and coherency of the man that penned
the romance. This document, a thor
oughly convincing volume, sets forth
the fact that Hearst's mission is to
down the trusts. Surely, a scene in this
drama is missing. In the first the
trusts, from coal. Ice and gas to water,
are dead, dying and buried, and over
TARPEY A MAN OF LETTERS.
HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION, ST. LOUIS, July 3.â
The oracle is being consulted to save
M. F. Tarpey from the burden of his
henors. He arrived here yesterday
morning as. erstwhile manager of
Hearst's campaign In California and
chairman of the California delegation.
Upon his arrival he turned his duties
as chairman over to Al McCabe and
George Cleary, secretaries of the dele
gation, converted the California head
quarters into an opposition Industrial
exposition and took command at the
Hearst headquarters. Yesterday he
was informed, though he had long
known it, that he had been selected for
national commjtteeman. To-day he
accepted ex-Governor Budd's proxy,
assigned to him by Al Murphy, to act
as> national committeeman prior to the
confirmation by the convention of the
new body.
And so, as manager of Hearst's Cal
ifornia campaign," chairman of the Cal
ifornia delegation, new committeeman,
national committeeman by proxy and
general pilot of the Hearst ship of as
piration, Michael F. Tarpey Is doing
fairly well. This euphonious string of
titles sounds like politics in China.
D. M. Delmas and William Jennings
Bryan met at the Hearst headquarters
to-day. If Bryan had any suggestions
to make they were not divulged. The
radicals are keeping their counsel with
commendable foresight.
The headquarters of the California
delegation are taking on an exposition
air. Fruits and Vines brought in by
the delegation are being arranged for
distribution and the success of the Chi
cago ent^irtainment promises to be du
plicated.*
A row may break. out in the Califor
nia delegation to-morrow. W. J. Mc-
Gee and Louis H. Mooser, the only
McNab men in the delegation, arc be
ginning to weary of their lonesome
ness. Up to date they have been for
gotten-,in the distribution of honorable
offices. They will voice their plaint to
the delegation to-morrow. If they are
Ignored it is quite possible they will
become a rlp-snortlng, swearing minor
ity of two. If they do, some interesting
details of the overland trip may leak
out.
The failure of Governor James H.
Budd to attend the convention is a
matter of disappointment to the Cali
fornlans. Budd Is one of the Golden
Staters whose name Is known In the
East; and he has been mentioned
among the Vice Presidential possibil
ities. . His absence is looked upon as
an indication that the Hearst forces
deem their fight a losing one, Budd
having befen one of the strongest sup
porters of the editor.
TROUBLE IN PROSPECT.
"It will be Impossible to nominate
Parker," he said. "The opposition is
now well organized and after the third
ballot Parker's adherents will begin to
drift away from him. We will gather
in much of this strength. We are more
encouraged with each passing hour."
A third pamphlet Issued from Tar
pey's bureau, under the title "Who
can surely carry New York State?''
leaves no opportunity to the reader to
indulge in speculation and answer the
question for himself. It lunges right
ahead and says: "Mr. Hearst can car
ry New York State."
Tarpey, although he does not yet
claim that Hearst will be nominated,
announced to-day that Parker was de
feated.

WANTAGE, England. July 3.âRob
ert A. Van Wyck visited Richard Cro
ker at his home here to-day and urged
the ex-chlef of Tammany Hall to use
his influence with the New York dele
gation to swing its vote from Parker
to Cleveland, after a complimentary
ballot had been given for Parker.
Van Wyck Pleads for Cleveland.
Some of the things that the Parker
adherents believe are greatly to the
advantage of their candidate are:
Â¦ First, they control by a large ma
jority the national/ committee, which
makes the temporary organization;
second, the temporary chairman of the
convention, Williams, is for Parker,
and. third, Alabama giving way to New
York allows the presentation of Par
ker's name to the convention. first.
The manner of presentation of Par
ker's name to the convention, it is be
lieved, will do much to help gain the
votes of uninstructed delegates. On
the roll call Alabama will give way to
New York, not having any "favorite
son." Martin W. Littleton of Brook
lyn, a celebrated orator of a .type pe
culiarly like William J. Bryan and
equally magnetic, will present Judge
Parker's name, while there will be
reconding speeches from several States.
Every preparation for a splendid re
ception to the New York Jurist has
been made and the impression is hoped
to cariy weight.
Some of the assurance of the Parker
managers on the success of their can
didate was based upon the statement
made to them by a close supporter of
Senator Gorman, who said that the
Senator had refused to allow his name
to be used for the purpose of effecting
a consolidation of interests inimical to
the candidacy of Parker. It was said
that while Senator Gorman's name
would be presented, it would be for
the purpose of k'eeping him groomed
so that in case of the failure of the
Parker boom he would be available.
PARKER'S ADVANTAGES.
Senator Hill himself is paying little
or no attention to the platform, at
least for the present, and this state
ment was made for him this afternoon
by one of those close to him:
"Senator Hill is not drawing up the
platform, and, while he will represent
New York on the committee on reso
lutions, he will not be its chairman.
Several men of affairs, including some
of the United States Senate and mem
bers of Congress, are preparing Indi
vidual, planks and will submit them at
a conference on Tuesday or Wednes
day. But Senator Hill wants it dis
tinctly understood that he has no plat
form prepared and that the only thing
he is devoting his attention to is the
nomination of Judge Parker."
Two things were stated definitely at
Senator Hill's "headquarters to-night
first, that no platform had been drawn
up for Judge Parker to stand upon, and
that not even a rough draft would be
forthcoming until Wednesday; and,
second, that Judge Parker as a candi
date would readily stand upon any
platform that a majority of the con
vention agreed to. This last statement
is significant, because it is thoroughly
well known that he would not stand
upon a radical platform.
PARTY WEARIES OF BRYAN.
It is evident that the Parker support
ers are already assured that the con
vention/will not agree to even a sug
gestion of the radicalism advocated by
the Brvan and Hearst supporters, but
will strongly tend in an entirely differ
ent direction, particularly on the finan
cial and tariff nlanks. A man close to
Senator Hill said to-night:
"The feeling is that the Bryan ele
ment has had its way twice. One year
it did as it pleased, and the next time
it was catered to and the old platform
indorsed. The Bryanites have had their
innings and have Wiled. This time they
must give way to the conservatives,
and if they are good Democrats they
will do it gracefully. This is not a mere
sentiment from New Yorkers. Early
this afternoon State Senator Barn
burger of Utah came here and made
the statement that .while he had twice
supported Bryan and his principles and
had in each campaign given largely of
his personal wealth to the campaign
fund, he believed Bryan should be elim
inated from this campaign and that, if
necessary, the party should go to the
extreme of absolute repudiation of his
ideas. The Texas delegation also feels
the same way about it and is for a di
rect declaration in favor of sound
money."
SOUND MONEY DECLARATION.
And so some of the time of the
Parker adherents this afternoon was
given up to the consideration of a
financial plank in the platform. There
is some differences of opinion as to
whether the plank should read "sound
money" or simply refer to the "money
of the constitution," while a few think
it would be proper to declare for a
gold standard. This latter thing will
not be done^ but it is probable there
will be a declaration "for the money
of the constitution."
ST. LOUIS, July 3.â New Yorkâ and,
of course, New York means Parkerâ is
so confident to-night that its candidate
is to be named that the delegates are
talking over with leaders of delegations
from other States the question of a
running mate, and to all States that
have a candidate for the place are
given assurances of their distinguished
esteem. Former Senator Hill, William
F. SheeHan, former. Senator, Murphy
and State Senator McCarren held a
levee all afternoon, and to-night, while
they had not yet seen all the delega
tions, promised for Parker, they are in
a state of such confidence that they
are not paying any attention to the ar
rival of the leaders of the Tammany
delegation. In fact, Senator McGarren
said this evening:
"We are looking for people who have
uuinstructed votes to deliver. The
Tammany votes will be cast by ex-
Senator Murphy, who votes New York
State under the unit rule, and he will
cast them for Parker, who will be nom
inated on the first ballot, or surely on
the second."
Staff. Correspondent of .The Call
BY FREDERIC W. BISHOP,
On the subject of candidates he main
tains the attitude that he has held
pll along, saying that he is not
urging the nomination of any particu
lar person and will be satisfied with
any one whose Democracy is unques
tioned and who can be trusted to faith
fully carry out Democratic policies af
ter election.
Later in the day Bryan gave out a
formal statement, in which he said:
"After conference with a number of
delegates from various eevtions I am
t-atisfied that the opposition to Parker
is f 'ufilc-lent to make his nomination im
probable. There has been no concen
tration on any candidate, but two ar
guments are having weight with the
"Does that mean that if a gold plank
is inserted in the platform you will
leave the convention?"
Bryan laughed heartily as he replied:
Â¦ "I do not think I will be called to an
swer that auestion in the convention
any more than I am compelled to an
swer it now. Really, I cannot discuss
such a auestion."
When asked if he had any particular
plank that he proposed to father before
the Committee on Resolutions, Bryan
declined to reply. Neither would he
eay/ if he would accept a financial
plank compromising between an af
lirmation of the Kansas City and Chi
cago platforms and a gold plank.
Bryan said he hoped to see a platform
satisfactory to the Democrats who had
borxie the burden of the fight in recent
campaigns.
"I have heard talk," he said, "of a
;?old plank in the platform. Of course,
it goes without saying that I am op
posed to such a thing and I will not
stand for it."
ST. LOUIS, Juiy 3. â William Jen
r.inps Bryan arrived at the Jefferson
Hotel shortly before noon to-day. The
instant he walked into the lobby hi
was surrounded by a crowd that
pressed forward to shake his hand.
There was no cheering nor demonstra
tion of any ( kind beyond the pressure
of the throng, which finally became so
dense that he had difficulty in reaching
his room. As soon as he entered the
door of his apartment the visitors weie
upon him and from that time on he
was given no rest. He declined to ex
press an opinion regarding the outcome
of the convention. .
"I see." he said, "that it has been re
ported that I am to be a member of
the Committee on Credentials. I would
like to be, but I will not be. I am to
be a member of the Committee on Res
olutions, and I could hardly serve en
them both."
On the subject of the platform Brya i
was more non-committal.
Nays the I>oniooracy Must Not Be Sur
rendercd to Wall Street.
BKYAX SCOKKS PARKER.
"For this reason I was opposed to
resolutions of instruction at Albany
under any circumstances, although I
favored the unit rule, by which the
linal judgment of the delegation after
consultation on the ground might be
made effective as an entirety. It may
be that in the country at large some
other candidate might be stronger than
Cleveland. I am speaking only of my
own State and with sincere desire for
Democratic success. If at this moment
I believed that Judge Parker would be
as strong before the people of the State
of New York as Cleveland would be, I
Fhould be the first to urge his nomina
tion, notwithstanding; the contest
fgainst instructions at the State con
\ention."
Following the giving out of this in
terview came the unfolding of the
scheme to beat Parker for the nomina
tion. It was very simple and consisted
in visiting the various delegations and
asking them to stick by their candi
dates long enough to produce a dead
lock. Davis of West Virginia was urged
to get together the Gorman States and
v.as promised that New York would
help later. The Hearst people were
urped to move on the common enemy
with an unbroken front, and even
Bryan was sent to in an endeavor to
keep a two-thin's vote from coming to
Parker on the first few ballots. It was
paid at Tammany's headquarters to
r,5ght that this would be the plan of
vampaig-n for the next few days.
Senator Hill when shown the Tam
many statements declined to discuss
them, as did also William F. Sheehan,
but the latter did say:
"We are satisfied with the result of
the day's effort."
ST. LOUIS. July 3.â The Tammany
advance ffuard arrived in St. Louis at
S:HO o'clock to-night, and had not more
than registered % than they caused to be
whispered around the plan by which
they hoped to demonstrate that Judgi
Parker could be beaten for the nomina
tiun. Charles F. Murphy, Bourke Cock
ran. Charles A. Towne. Thomas F.
Grady. Victor Dowling and William
Sulzer were the orators and politicians
xvho were at the head of the party, and
within thi'.U" minutes of their arrival
they had prepared the following state
ment, attributed to Charles F. Murphy:
"My position now is what it has con
stantly been. I have said, and still say,
that in my opinion Cleveland, so far as
the State of New York is concerned,
would be the strongest candidate this
convention could name. Of course, I
cannot siieak for other States, and I
have thought that the best result would
be likely to be reached by deliberation
among: the delegates representing a;i
the States and untrammeled by pre
rommitment or instructions.
"The second objection is the one that
carries weight with the conservative
delegate, viz., that he cannot win. It
is becoming more and more apparent
that he would prove a weak candidate.
"The first fight seems to be over the
Illinois contests. The Illinois case has
no parallel. The convention was run
by brute force. The contestants will
present the indorsement of a majority
of delegates of the convention, who,
having been deprived of a vote in the
State convention, will appeal for Jus
tice. The national committee cannot
indorse' the Hopkins methods without
overthrowing the most fundamental of
Democratic doctrinesâ the right of the
majority to rule."
delegates. Among the radicals the feel
inK is that the party must not be sur
rendered into the hands of Wall street.
The influences back of the Parker can
didacy are so intimately associated
with the trusts and great corporations
that the Democratic party could not
appeal to the masses. The party can
not afford to intrust its future to the
men who were responsible for the par
ty's defeat in 1896 and 1900. If Parker
had a record of his own he might be
Judged upon that record. But as he has
refused to speak he must be Judged by
the record of his political manager, ex-
Senator Hill, and his financial agent,
August Belmont. and their records. A
man who is weak enough to put his
candidacy in their hands before the
convention would not be strong enough
to resist their influence after the elec
tion if he was by any possibility suc
cesslul.

Southern Cotton Spindles.
A little more than ten years ago, 1890
1891, says a writer in Gunton's Maga
zine, there were in Southern cotton
mills some 1,950,000 spindles, operated
by approximately 30,000 hands. In 1903
there were in Southern cotton.^mills
8,000,000 spindles, with about 130,000
hands to run them. At the earlier date
the cotton mills in the South employed
about one-seventh of all the cotton mill
operatives in the country. Now that
section finds labor for nearly one-half
the whole number of hands engaged in
cotton mills in the United States. In
the ten years from 1892 ~-to 1902 the
number of spindles in Northern mills
increased 1,750,000, while the increase in
the South was 4,450,000 spindles. These
figures set forth with an eloquence that
must be convincing the ambition and
determination of the South to enjoy, as
far as possible, the profit and inciden
tal advantages to be secured by the
conversion of the raw material they
produce into cloth right where the cot
ton Is raised. â New York Commercial.
The numerals of 1888 added together
(1 plus 7 plus 8 plus 8) are equal to 25,
and the Emperor, by adding this 25 to
1888, learned that 1913. was the year in
which, according to the seer, the em
pire would be overthrown in Germany
and a republip established in Its stead.
â Chicago Chronicle.
King William, grandfather of the
present German Emperor, was told a
few months before his accession to the
throne of Prussia by a Berlin prophet
ess the year when he would becdme
Emperor and also the year of his
death. The Klmj, she said, would be
come Emperor in 1871, because this was
the date obtained" by adding to 1S49,
the year in which he had come to the
throne, the numerals (22) of which 1849
was composed. She then said that he,
would certainly die in 18S8. since this
was the date obtained by adding to
1871, the year in which he would become
Â¦Emperor, the numerals (17) of which
1871 was composed.
The present Emperor has pondered at
times over this prophecy, and recently
he consulted a seer, who arrived at re
sults in the same manner and who as
sured him that if he desired to know
the year in whicH Germany would be
come a republic all that he need do
was to add to 1888, the year of his
grandfather's death, the numerals of
which 1888 was composed.

LOOMING UP IX FUTURE
Recent Russian denials of naval loss
es have been particularly directed \to
the statement contained in a previous
report from Admiral Togo that on June
23 the Japanese inflicted serious losses
upon the Russian fleet off Port Ar
thur.
Foreigners who left Port Arthur the
evening of July 1 reached Chefu on
July 2. Their reports made no men
tion of the sinking of two Russian war
ships.
Refugees from Port Arthur who have
arrived recently at Chefu report that
four Russian battleships, with gun
boats and torpedo boats, are kept in
the harbor, while two battleships, five
cruisers and a flotilla of torpedo boats
make excursions to sea.
Recent reports from Russian sources
mentioned continued activity and sev
eral engagements by land and by sea
near Port Arthur from June 24 to June
30. A Russian official report said that
on the night of June 24-25 Japanese
torpedo boats approached the fortress
at Port Arthur, and that on June 26 a
Japanese land attack was supported
by a cannonade from the warships.
During the evening of June 29 the forts
and batteries at Port Arthur opened
fire on Japanese torpedo boats. A dis
patch from Chefu said a big battle
was fought on land near Port Arthur
on June 26 and 27. No mention, how
ever, has been made of Russian losses'
to correspond with those reported by
Admiral Togo.
The Russian torpedo-boat destroyer,
Lieutenant Burukoff, left Port Arthur
on the night of Tuesday, June 28/ and
reached Newchwang the next day. Â§he
is believed to have cony out with dis
patches for the army and St. Peters
burg. The Russian Foreign Office has
given out a dispatch, dated June 30,
announcing that the Russian warships
safely re-entered Port Arthurs-after the
fight of June 23 and that not one of
them was damaged.
CHICAGO, July 3.â Michael Kappel,
residing at 514 Clybourne avenue, when
examined for life insurance to-day was
found to be an anatomical freak.
Through an X-ray examination Dr.
Adolph Decker discovered that all of
Kappel's internal organs occupy exact
ly opposite positions to those, of the
ordinary man. His heart is on the right
side, his liver is on his left side and his
stomach is on his' right side.
Kappel lives with his wife and three
children and is In perfect health. Before
he came to this country he served two
terms in the German army without the
surgeons ever discovering the displace
ment of his organs, and had he not
wished to insure his life he probably
never would have known of the de
formity.
Dr. Decker, who has made a special
study of Kappel and other cases of this
kind, says that sitres Inverses, as the
deformity is called. Is very rarely
found. The first case, waa discovered
by a noted English physician. Dr. Aber
nethy, about 1790, in the body of a dead
child. Dr. Decker says that usually in
such cases the person is left-handed
also, but Kappel is not. As far as ap
pearances go he 13 the same as any
other man.
Special Dispatch- to The Call.
The letters grew more frequent and
a week ago a silver-haired man ar
rived at Montpelier, Idaho. In the par
lor of the little hotel there he was
married to a silver-haired woman, ful

shore when both were young.;
They moved into the little cottage at
Bennington. Almost immediately the
old wife began to fail. She now lies

BEXXINGTON, Idaho, July 3.â Mrs.
Robert McCallum, 85 years old, lies
slow!*- dying in her little home here.
By her side sits her husband, 88 years
old. Bride and groom, they are living
over a romance that began more than
half a century ago.
Robert McCallum and Annie Graham
were lovers in New Jersey sixty years
ago. The day for their wedding had
been set when the Graham family met
a Mormon elder, became converted to
the Mormon faith and decided to follow
the fortunes of Joseph Smith, the
prophet. Annie Graham elected to go
with her family. McCallum refused to
become a convert to the strange faith
and they parted.
The Graham family left for the West
with the Mormons, passed through the
troublous times at Kirtland, Ohio, and
Nauvoc, Illinois, and in 1847 completed
the weary pilgrimage across mountain
and plain to Salt Lake.
In Salt Lake Annie Graham married
a man named Weaver and became the
mother of a large family.
The Weaver family moved to Idaho,
where Weaver died about ten years
ago. About the same time McCallum's
wife died in New Jersey. McCallum
and the sweetheart of his youth had
exchanged occasional letters during
the many years that had passed, but
had never seen each other since they
parted. Their children had grown to
manhood and womanhood and both
were left alone. *

CURIOUS FACT REVEALED
"Mr Quinby and mvself came over
to-day to see whether this lot was ready
for shipment. "We had no idea of the
excitement its discovery provoked.
"Yes, a lot of it has been sent to
Port Arthur, and I presume has been
used In making land and submarine
mines. The Japanese could also have
purchased it from the' individuals to
whom it has been shipped. Under no
circumstances can it be classed as con
traband of war, and I do not see where
we can be involved in any difficulty
over a violation of the neutrality laws.
The stuff is going now to Chinese ports,
and is, of itself, a harmless substnee."
"I want to add," interrupted Chem
ist Quinby, "that this material is not
inflammable in its present state, that
is, not dangerously so. In mixing it
and packing the compound I permit
the men to smoke and I smoke myself
when weighing out the Ingredients."
Explanations were made to the police
and to the fire department officials this
afternoon,^ and these tended toallay
the intense excitement that had been
created.
"Mixed with either chlorate of pot
ash, nitrate of potash or nitrate of
soda it becomes an explosive and can
be made equal to 60 per cent nitroglyc
erin. In its high form it Is known as
'dragonite.'
"So much for the explosive. I manu
factured .this 'dope' at Sobrante and
also in San Francisco before coming
to Oakland. It Is being handled by
A. B. Fields. I am under contract not
to sell any in this country. Of course,
you have heard of the powder trust.
I am not In it. My patents cover for
eign countries."
. That fully 100 tons of the stuff have
been sent to Port Arthur was admitted
by Fields, who said:
"I have been shipping the 'dope,' as
Quinby calls it, to private consignees
in the Orient. It can be used for mines
as well as for blasting, or other pur
poses for which explosives are utilized.
Where this base compound goes after
It is sold I am not In a position to say.
It has been shipped regularly on the
Pacific liners, and you may be
sure that if it were a dangerous ma
terial we could, not send it on them.
The steamship people, as well as the.
authorities, have investigated it.'
EXPRESS SURPRISE.
"Let me set your mln,ds at ea.se," said
Quinby. "This stuff is not. explosive.
But it will be after it has been treated
in China, where the shipment you see
here is going. Those barrels contain
about ten tons of what we call 'dope.'
It is a patented composition to be used
as a base for high or low grade explo
sives, as may be desired by the pur
chasers of it. I am the patentee and
Piko Is a half-owner In the formula.
The compound is composed of sulphur,
fixed carbon, hydro-carbon and nitro
benzol. It is, in its present state, as
harmless as a cooing dove.
In the midst of the disturbance that
Focacci's complaint caused Quinby and
Fields sauntered into the Demartini
cottage.
"An old man living near here came
to me to-day and told me that I should
see that no fireworks were used around
my place to-morrow, because the stuff
in the barrels in Demartini's yard
would blow up or get afire, and there
would not be water enough in Oakland
to put out the flames.
"I went around and looked at the
barrels and notified the police."
A. Cavagnaro, Lawrence Grondona
and Tilston Owens, who had worked in
the building at 625 Myrtle street, where
a large quantity of the compound was
manufactured last year, told the police
that it had been shipped to Russian
end to Chinese ports in large quanti
ties. Sulphur, oils and bran were used
In making It, and the process was care
fully handled by."W. C. Quinby, one of
the owners of the formula. Further in
quiry developed that Quinby, who is an
expert chemist, residing at 2929 Lin
coln avenue, Alameda, Is associated
with R. D. Pike, a wholesale liquor
merchant at 213 Battery street, San
Francisco, in the enterprise. A. B.
Fields, a broker of San Francisco, ap
peared as a third person interested in
the enterprise.
. MANUFACTURERS ARRIVE.
Captain of Police W. J. Petersen, ac
companied by Chief Engineer N. A.
Ball of the Fire Department, went to
the scene. They found in the rear of
Demartini's cottage fifty-two barrels
filled with a mixture which had betn
given all kinds of mysterious force.
Likewise did they find galvanized iron
tub's in the cottage cellar that had
been used as mixing tanks. There lay
the stuff, apparently menacing the city
for blocks around. Focacci told this
story to the officers:
The discovery of fifty barrels of the
compound in the back yard of D. De
martini's residence, 627 Myrtle street,
aroused great excitement this morn
ing, and caused police and fire depart
ments to make, an investigation. Louis
Focacci, residing at 653 Myrtle street,
a few doors north of the Demartini
house, brought about the investigation
by reporting to the Chief of Police his
discovery that the back yard of his
neighbor contained enough explosive
material to destroy the entire town.
OFFICERS INVESTIGATE.
OAKLAND, July S.â From Port Ar
thur to Oakland is a far cry, but a
chain of interesting revelations have
connected the Manchurian seaport with
the Athens of the Pacific.
Through a complaint, which was
made to the authorities, it has been
disclpsed that large Quantities of ma
terial from which explosives for the
mines, land and submarine," used in de
stroying Japanese and Russian soldiers
and ships, are being manufactured in
a secluded corner of this city.
The owners of the process will not
admit that they have sold, any of it
direct to the Russian or, the Japanese
governments, but it is known, never
theless, thajt more than 100 tons of
the composition was shipped to Port
Arthur to private 'consignees before
the war began. Large quantities have
also been forwarded to Chinese ports,
there to be manufactured into an ex
plosive equal in power \o 60 per cent
nitroglycerin.
The cause of the delay by Admiral
Togo in forwarding this report is not
known, but it is presumed that he waa
busy and did not have time to com
municate with Tokio.
The twelfth torpedo flotilla, under the
command of Commander Yamada, de
livered the attack. The Japanese ves
sels were revealeS by the Russian
searchlights and the shore forts opened
a heavy fusillade upon them.
The Russian guardship was sur
rounded and attacked by the Japanese,
who saw this vessel sink amid the
huge volumes of water thrown up by
a heavy explosion. Following this the
Russian torpedo-boat destroyers at
once attacked the Japanese vessels,
which responded to the onslaught. A
Russian destroyer, while within the
area lighted by the searchlights, was
seen to explode, rise, fall back into the
water sideways and sink.
The guardship sank near the base of
Golden Hill.
TOKIO, July 3.â A belated report
from Admiral Togo records a desperate
and successful torpedo attack at the
entrance of Port Arthur last Monday
night, June 27, in which a Russian
guardship and a Russian torpedo-boat
destroyer were sunk.
The guardship is described as hay
ing two masts and three funnels. She
was either a battleship or a llrst-class
cruiser and she was torpedoed and de
stroyed. The torpedo-boat destroyer
was struck and then blew up and sank.
Admiral Togo reports the loss o-f one
officer and thirteen men killed and one
officer and two men wounded. He
makes no mention of damage to his
fleet. _ .
Lieutenant General Sakharoff, under
â¢date of July 2, reports minor outpost
affairs and reconnaissances in the
neighborhood of Siakhotau. General
Sakharoff believes that dysentery is
very prevalent ~" among the Japanese
troops.
~ On June 27 the Russian fire destroyed
two Japanese guns and a caisson. There
are fresh indications of a Japanese ad
vance near Siakhotau. According to the
report Russian scouts have ascertained
that a number of Korean soldiers are
assisting the Japanese. ' â¢
LIAOYANG, July 3.â The whole of
Manchuria seems to have turned into a
marsh,-' and the weather almost pre
cludes a movement by either side.
It is reported that the Japanese are
near Liaoyang and a battle is expected
when the weather Dermits. The coun
try is such that a few days of sunshine
will dry the roads.
It is reported that 20,000 Japanese are
working toward Mukden, but this is
scarcely credited.
LONDON, July 4.â The* Central News
has received the following from Tatche
kiao under date of July 3: ,
"The weather is dry, but the Japa
nese are taking no action. The Chinese
state that the Japanese lack victuals,
medicines and forage. East of Kaichou
the . principal Japanese force have
fallen back, abandoning their positions.
There have been no notable changes
on the road to Liaoyang."
- According to a dispatch to the Cen
tral News from Mukden, dated July 3.
it is reported that the Japanese are
moving two divisions upon Liaoyang
from Fenshui Pass.
One of the most striking features of
the situation is the lack of naval news
from the Russian side, but it is pointed
out that If. the fleets had gone out such
news would be natorally slow in com
ing through Russian, sources. .
ST. PETERSBURG, July 4, 4:30 a. m.
Official news up to July 2 indicates that
the Japanese advance from the south
has been suspended, along with all oth
er Important move'ments at the seat of
war. The authorities do not expect
much more than desultory skirmishing
until the weather improves. The situa
tion is considered satisfactory from the
Russian standpoint.
There Is evidences of considerable
sickness in the Japanese camps. ,It is
expected here that thfe Japanese will
suffer more from the/ rainy weather
than will General Kuropatkin's force.
OCTOGENARIANS WED
SACRAMENTO, July 3. â Two
freight trains going in opposite direc
tions came together with a terrific
Â« rash near Blue Canyon at an early
hour this morning. An unknown tramp
Mas killed and another injured, while
:in engineer and brakeman received
severe injuries. The head-on collision
was evidently due to the failure of
some employe of the company to keep
track of the movements of the two
trains. The scene of the wreck was a
Â¦winding pass in tHe high Sierras. The
engineers of the two trains did not
know of their danger until a turn
through the-liilis brought them face to
face. It was then too late to control
the locomotives and the collision which
followed was one of the worst ever
witnessed on the mountain division.
The engines were demolished and the
< ars of both trains derailed. It re
quired the services of two wrecking
* rews for twelve hours to clear the
track for the overland passenger trains
tlelayed by the accident.
Knpineer C. M. Fogus of Rocklin,
who had charge of one of the locomo
tives, was thrown from his seat in
the csb by the force of the collision
and his back severely injured. He
trafl brought to his home and medical
aid given him. W. L. Bohannon, a
lirakeraan of tire eastbound train, was
severely bruised about the head and
remained unconscious for six hours.
He was brought to the railroad hos
pital at Sacramento, where it was said
this evening his injuries were not seri
ous. An unknown tramp, who was
riding on a freight car, was thrown
from his hiding place and killed, while
another tramp, name also unknown,
suffered a bad fracture of the Jaw.
The light attachments of both locomo
tives were completely torn off and the
engines piled up in a mass at the side
<if the track. The escape of the en
gineers and train crews from instant
death is regarded as miraculous.
Tramp Killed and Several of the Crew
Hurt in Collision.
FREIGHT TRAIN'S WRECKED.
The injured were mostly taken to
private houses in the vicinity of the
wreck and later on those who were able
were removed to hospitals. The sur
vivoi s of the disaster went to St. Louis
late to-night. One of the survivors was
Andrew M. Lawrence of California, a
Hearst political manager.
Charles Corneau, station agent at
Litchfield, said that the wreck was the
result of malicious mischief. He said
it was plain that the switch was tam
pered with.
"Lay me dov.n somewhere and go
back and save the women and chil
dren."
F. "Ward of Chicago showed partic
ular nerve. One of his legs had been
torn off. When he was carried out of
The wreck he said:
"I saw two persons burned to death.
One was a man and the other a young
pirl. I do not know their names.
Wreckage held them down until the
heat became unbearable and the men
who were trying to save them could
riot remain another moment.
"There was. another passenger, a
woman, whose feet were pinned down
by a heavy beam. It could not be
moved and ehe begged that her feet
be cut off. The flames drove every
body away before she could be saved."
A. E. Darling of St. Louis, one of the
passengers on . board the observation
cas. said: .
The train consisted of six cars, all
heavily loaded with passengers. The
three rear cars, diner and two sleepers,
were not derailed. The other cars were
riled uo in an Indescribable mass and,
â¢with the crushed freight cars on the
tiding:, took lire. A rumor spread that
one of the freight cars was loaded with
explosives, and* for the time this had
the effect of retarding the work of res
cue.
Dr. P. J. Farrell of Chicago, one of
the passengers, directed the work of
rescue, giving medical attention to the
injured. Temporary hospital headquar
ters -were hastily established in Litch
field. A driving rainstorm prevailed.
The dead were removed as speedily as
possible A.0 undertaking rooms. It is
probable that the exact number of dead
will not be known for several days, as
the passengers assert that bodies were
cremated in the burning debris.
SEES VICTIMS CREMATED.

the number Is not so great."

Disease, over-exertion, fright, anxiety,
alcohol, tobacco ~and other stimulants
weaken the nerves, but the heart. In-
stead of stopping, makes extraordinary

WOMEN'S PROHIBITION
CLUB ENTERTAINED
Franklin Perry ' Hooper, the well
known lumberman, died suddenly at
his residence, 2522 Green street, last
evening at 7 o'clock. The cause of
his death was apoplexy. J Â¦
He spent yesterday afternoon in town
and was on his way home to dinner,
and almost there, when he was taken
ill in the car. He asked the assistance
of some friends, who happened to be
passing by, and they helped him to his
home. He was able to reach a chair
in the front hallway and then quietly
passed away. He suffered a slight
shock of apoplexy about two years ago,
from which he had apparently recov
ered. He was actively engaged in his
business affairs up. to Saturday night.
Mr. Hooper came to San Francisco
in the early fifties. So soon as he left
hchool he. went into -the. lumber busi
ness and has for years been promi
nently identified with that industry.
He was a member of the firm of F. P.
and J. A. Hooper.
He was born in Massachusetts on
October 6, 1836. He was unmarried. He
had only just recently moved into his
beautiful new home, where he resided
with his widowed sister, Mrs. W. E.
Norwood. Besides Mrs. Norwood he
leaves three brothers, John A, Hooper,
Charles A. Hooper and George W.
/Hooper. As all the members of his
family excepting: his two nephews are
out of the city, no arrangements have
been made regarding the funeral.
Toi-pedood lu Park Row.
Two marines from the battleship
Kentucky were headed for the Park
row entrance of the bridge, on a
course from the southward. One of
them carried a big grip with a large
cargo under its hatches. It was early
in the afternoon rush and the marines
had hard work maneuvering. In the
swirl of the human current at Frank
fort street the Nassau tide hit them
and they were swept around. The
man with the grip was carried clean
off, his feet and left stranded in the
roadway on the edge of the vortex.
His companion was hustled In the
same direction, but managed to keep
his feet.
Slowly the castaway reached a level
keel and caught the arm of the other
craft in distress, as he looked, dazed,
at the thousands of skilled navigators
scudding toward the bridge.
"Say, Bill," he finally ejaculated,
"you've gotter go slow in this man's
town or you'll get torpedoed." â New
York Press. . ,-V
Blunders of the Rich.
It is a bad blunder for the rich men
to try to shirk their civic duties. It
creates prejudice against them. They
may not care for that, but it is a mat
ter of serious care to them whether or
not the law is upheld. Without law
theirÂ»vast property interests would be
worth nothing. The more the people
respect the law the better it would be
for property owners, and if for no
higher and nobler reason it is clearly
in the material interest of the rich that
law and order shall prevail, and it la
therefore in their interest to discharge
their civic duties with faithfulness and
with willingness and to respond cheer
fully to the demands of tfi e state
authorities.â Richmond (Va.) Times-
Dispatch.
Boy Hurt by Explosion.
James Delehanty Jr., the 10-year

the sand apd his face was lacerated by

A Good Samaritan.
A Southern writer tells this story of
a negro preacher's version of the par
able of the good samantan: There
was a traveler on a lonely road, said
, the preacher,** who was set upon by
| thieves, robbed and left wounded and
helpless by the wayside. As he lay
there various persons passed hirn, but
J none offered to assist him. Presently,
however, a poor Samaritan came by
and, taking pity on the wounded man's
plight, helped him on his mule and
took him to an inn, where he ordered
food . and drink and raiment for the
man, directing .the innkeeper to send
the bill to him. "And dis am a true
story, brethren," concluded the preach
er, "for de inn am standln' dere yet,
and in de do'way am standin' de
skel'ton ob de innkeeper, waitin* f er
de good Samaritan to come back an*
pay de bill."â Baltimore Herald. V..

Sensenbreuner helped the man whom
he had wounded to get back to Berke
ley, where Dr. Payne treated him tem
porarily. Lux was then brought to the
Oakland Receiving Hospital and placed
under the care of Dr. Stratton. The
young man's wounds are very serious.
Young Lux, who is a machinist by
trade, came to Berkelev to-dav with
Henry Sensenbreuner, who lives at 788
Folsom street, San Francisco. They
had one shotgun between them and
started for Wildcat Canyon, back of
Berkeley. There are some curious caves
in the canyon that Lux knew about
and he was anxious. his friend should
see 'them. He started to lead Sensen
breuner to them, and was a short dis
tance * ahead, when Sensenbreuner
stumbled and the shotgun was dis
charged. The full charge took effect
in Lux's back, wounding him very se
riously.
Albert Lux, 21 years of age, living at
1105 Mason street, San Francisco, was
accidentally shot by a companion while
hunting in the hills back of Berkeley,
and is in a critical condition at the
Oakland Receiving; Hospital.

CEXTEUVILLE'S PATRIOTIC PLAN.
Citizens Arrange Fine Prosrammc in
Honor of Xatal Day.
Dr. Arrhenius* researches have re
sulted in the discovery of some facts
that are highly interesting to biolog
ical science. Among others the analogy
that exists between the blood of
man and the highest types of the mon
key family, particularly the chimpan
zee. The tests with lisin have developed
that they are closely related, for the
poison has had the same effects in the
experiments with the blood of the two
animals.
A number of experiments have been carried
on with the blood of various animals. The
blood Is treated with a poison called Hsln.
which acts on the corpuscles so as to affect its
color. In order to determine what other poi
sons counteract this poison we apply anti
poisons and thus discover the basis for a new
serum.
With tuberculosis we have not pursued any
lengthy investigation, but it is possible that in
time something may be accomplished. Dr.
Koch, you know, discovered tuberculine. but
hf> never achieved final success. About the
only thin? tubercultne did was to develop un
mistakable evidences of tuberculosis in ani
mals that had boen previously only suspected
of the disease.
Typhus is such a malignant disease that it
is doubtful If it can be snid that treatment
with serum is successful. The common method
of investigation with that disease haa been to
extract blood from the patient and experiment
with it. Great success has been secured with
a serum in India, where formerly large num
bers of people were killed annually by the pot
son of reptiles. It has also become the com
mon thing to supply the French troops in
Madagascar to protect them against the snakes
there.
These researches are being caried on with
IJie knowledge that every poison has its spe
cial anti- poison. A disease Is a poison that
affects some part of the body. It can ba
reached through the agency of the blood.
which itself is poisoned. By the application
of the anti-poison, of which thÂ» Â«erum is
composed, a reactionary effect is obtained and
the disease is conquered. I believe that in
time this method will bring about a revolu
tion In the practlpe of medicine
The great difficulty is to secure an anti
poison that will be efficacious and it \s aionz
these lines that I am working. In the case
of diphtheria we have had the most aucoess
and the serum for that disease Is now being
manufactured everywhere. It was a compara
tively easy disease to study, as its indica
tions are always on the surface. By inocu
lating the lower animals with the white mem
brane of patients afflicted with that disease
we were able to ascertain Just what counter
poisons gave results.
Professor Svante A. Arrhenius of the
Summer School faculty of the Univer
sity of California believes that with
the application of chemistry to the cure
of diseases the treatment of human ills
will soon be reduced to such a scien
tific basis that men will marvel at the
crude and illozical methods that have
obtained so long in this enlightened
age. The greatest physicist of the
world holds to this belief, because he
has had a measure of success with
serum-therapy in his own native land
of Sweden ' and in Denmark, where
there Is a National Serum Institute.
The results that Dr. Arrhenius has
obtained in this great field of research
he proposes to give to the world for the
first time in a series of lectures during
the summer session at the University.
None of the discoveries Dr. Arrhenius
has made have ever been published and
no doubt they will be of the most pro
found importance to scientists and
medicos.
The successes that have been ob
tained with serum and its application
to diseases are so far limited to a few
of the more malignant types of bodily
ills. These may be enumerated as
diphtheria, lockjaw and possibiy ty
phus. Partial successes have also been
secured with the bubonic plague, chol
era and blood poisons that have been
caused by reptiles. In discussing his
experiments to-day at the Loeb Physi
ological Laboratory, where he is asso
ciated for the summer with Dr. Jacques
Loeb, Dr. Arrhenius said the sum and
substance of nearly all diseases lie in
the poisons that the body secretes,
therefore it is the obligation of science
to discover the counteracting antidote.
He said:

A. It. Uc-nkeâ I have been bo busy this we-ek
that I have scarcely had time to realize Just
how lively the realty market Is In Alameda.
If business continues as It Is. no dealer In
Alameda can Justly complain.
Charlep Adams of Charles Adams & Co.
People are fast coming tot realize that central
Alamfda Is as fine a location for a home as
any other portion of the city. The result Is
that we have had many Inquiries from outside
parties for building- Kites find -expect to record
many transOrs In th" near future.
Frank Hally of Ually & Co.â We have had
renters as fust as the houses have been placed
in our hands. We have aleo several trades
of outside property for Alameda realty In
process of nrpotlation.
K. I). JucM of E. TVJudd & Co.â ThÂ«?re are
practically no modern houses to be renter! In
Alameda and as fast as one is ready a score
of perftons wait, to take It. Building wfth us
is brisker thnn It has been for yearn.
Captain J. S. Hanley of .1. S. Hanley & Co.â
In all my experience In the real estate busl
nesn in Alameda I do not remember It to have,
been better. The houses going up are more
artistic and MibstanUal than ever before and
the people erecting them appear to be of the
ironpyed clae*. Ther* are twelve jsplendld
homes being built now in the neighborhood of
Morton etatlrn.
ALAMEDA, July. 3.â Business of local
real estate dealers continues brisk, de
spite the vacation lull. Building is
lively, and there are more homes now
nearing completion in Alameda than
for any corresponding period in the his
tory of the city. Modern cottages and
residences are taken by waiting ten
ants as soon as ready for occupancy
or vacant, and the demand for houses
to rent has been for some time and is
now far in excess of the supply. Here
is what some of the realty brokers have
to sav of the existing conditions of the
market:
William Hammond Jr. of Hammond & Ham
mond â Several important sales were negotiated
hy us last week. We sold to M. Hy*rÂ« the
northwest corner of Peru street and Pacific
avenue, on which are located four two-story
modern residence*. The price obtained was
close to $12,0<i0. We also sold to Joseph Faure
on account of F. I?. Elderkln a lot and nix
room cottage on the east sfdÂ« of Pearl street,
betv.-ecn Kncinal and Han Jose avenues.
Frank X. Dodd of the Alameda Land Com
pany â We have had a good week and within
the next few days will close up a number of
deals Involving tho ccnetructlon of fine resi
dences. We have boen unab!<Â» for months to
meet the demand for modern cottages to rent
and the result of this has been that the erec
tion of iÂ»ur-h hnmrs is experiencing a boom.
SAN LEANDRO. July 3.â The Ma
sons of San Leandro are planning for
a new Masonic Temple, to be erected
at the corner of Hepburn street and
Hay ward avenue. The plans for the
new structure have already been sub
mitted to a joint committee from the
lodges interested. The building will
be two "stories and a half in height.
The ground floor will contain two
stores, four offices, a lodge room and
ante-rooms. On the second floor will be
two lodge rooms and a parlor, and in
the half-story above will be two ban
quet rooms and a complete kitchen.
The new Temple will be the joint
property of the three Masonic orders
of. San Leandro, the Blue Lodge No.
113, the Royal Arch Chapter No. 66
and the Eastern Star No. 103.
If the present plans are accepted the
construction work will be begun this
month.
ACTIVE ALAMEDA.
NEW MASONIC TEMPLE.
During the last eight months more than $70,
000 has been invested in real estate in Elm
hurst. There are now ten buildings under
construction, all of modern architecture. Hard
ly a vacant house Is to be had In Elmhurst,
notwithstanding many new buildings have been
erected during the year.
Prices on property In Elmhurat are based
upon actual conditions and a purchase now iÂ«
unquestionably the beef realty investment in
the State.
Within the last ftw weeks there has been a
peneral revival of business In real estate In
Elmhum, with an increased number of in
quiries and consequent increased number of
sales. This Indicates that Elmhurst as a resi
dence suburb is becoming better known among
home Â£*>ekers.
Not only has the sale of property to
outsiders been large, but there has been
a great influx of people, who, though
unable to purchase or build, have come
t% live in Oakland. These newcomers
have rented homes. In consequence, It
is almost impossible now to find houses
in desirable localities for rent.
SUBURBAN REALTY IX DEMAND.
James J. O'Toole. a prominent real
estatÂ»; dealer at Elmhurst, says:
Steadily increasing sale pf Oakland,
Berkeley and Alameda property have
marked the last month as one of the
most prosperous periods in the history
of Alameda County. In spite of the
fact that many people, in all parts of
the State have been away from home
on their summer vacations, local deal
ers report a larger amount of business
for June than at any previous time
during the present year. Â¦ Â¦
A number of Important sales of Oak
land and Berkeley real esjate have
been made to people who have for
years had their homes In San Fran
cisco, but who, in consequence of the
increased transportation facilities be
tween that 'city and Oakland, have de
cided to locate here. Nearly thirty per
cent of the June sales were made to
people from San Francisco or more dis
tant parts of California.

A dream? All reforms are dreams

nightmares, but they materialize if
builded upon truth and sanity.
day to discourage the use of fireworks
â particularly the dangerous type â
we may beget a sane generation a
century hence that will honor the
birth of our nation in a sane man
ner, picnicking, singing national an
thems, .displaying from the housetops
the stars and stripes, holding patri
otic entertainments in every school
house in th? land. In which the chil
dren would be the participants â these
things would inculcate a sane quality
of patriotism and the boys and girls
would have as merry a Fourth as do
the urchins to-day with their distorted
ideas. Â«
Let us strive to help the California
Club in the beginning of its campaign
against self-murder in the name of
our nation. By the education of pub
lic sentiment alone can a movement
of this kind, that subverts the pre
conceived notions of our childhood,
be carried forth. Think, men and
women, of the oaln and destruction
that the day will bring forth and
answer, without preconceived preju
dice; is it worth while? Is it com
patible -with the dignity of our nation
or our intelligence as twentieth cen
tury citizens? And in answering,
eliminate the element of depriving
our children of their Fourth of July
fun â let us substitute sane fun. and
fun that will not turn into a shriek, a
moan and a blackened stump-rand
fun that will not lay waste the homes
of our children. .
And as to the other side of the
question, the sport that the small boy
gets out of his fireworks, it is all a
matter of education. If we begin to-
dollars' worth of property destroyed,
homes and industries lapped up by
tongues of flame, fields and forests left
a blackened waste, lives imperiled in
the fighting of fires, and the lives and
parts of lives that will go out through
the "didn't-know-it-was-loaded" bombs
and guns, not to mention the shatter
ing of the nerves of the sickâ all these
disasters because we, as a nation,
haven't stupped long enough to think
how absurd it all isâ either that, or
we haven't had the courage to cry out
against such an abnormal and ridicu
lous custom that entails such suffering
and such losses.

The Le Conte memorial lodge orig
inated in the suggestion of members
of the Sierra Club and the committee
appointed to consider ways and means
to provide the memorial consisted of
Professor William R. Dudley, Profes
sor A. C. Lawson. Dr. Edward R. Tay
lor, Elliott McAllister and William E.
Colby. The death of Professor Le
Conte in Yosemite Valley In July, 1902,
and his active and useful life suggested
the character and position of the me
morial. It was determined, instead
of the usual conventional shaft and In
scription, to erect something that
would be of aid and cheer to the thou
sands of mountain lovers who annually
visit the Yosemite. The lodge stands
on Professor Le Conte's favorite spot
in lhe valley and within a' hundred
yards of the place where he died.
TTiough formally opened and dedi
cated to-day, the lodge has been acces
sible all seaso- Robert L. McWill
iams, a recent gradtntp of the Univer
sity of California, and every way quali
fied for the task, will have charge of
the lodge during the summer. Books,
guides, . and maps of the high Sierras
have been placed there, and the custo
dian will give Information to parties
wishing to make more extended trips
from Yosemite into the higher Sierras.
The lodge is v entirely free to all visitors
in the valley, and copies of the daily
papera and the magazines will be kept
on file for their use. ..
LODGE PRETTILY SITUATED.
Dr. Le Conte's membership In the
club dates from its organization. In
1SS2, and he had always been a loyal
and enthusiastic friend to the club's
endeavors. His knowledge of the high
Sif-rras was probably more extensive
tban that of any other man In Califor
nia and his own work had contributed
aa much as {hat of any other In mak
ing "The Range of Light" known to
the people and the scientific world. His
first visit to the Yosemite Valley oc
curred in 1871 and he met his death
peacefully there on July 6, 1901.
The Lodge will be the permanent
headquarters of the Sierra Club in the
mountains and it Is the intention grad
ually to collect a complete set of maps
of the whole range, a library of all
books relating to the mountains of Cal
ifornia and records of explorations by
members and other mountaineers
among unknown and usually Inaccessi
ble peaks. Mr. John White, the arch
itect donated his services and the
plans of the structure and the Board
of Yosemite Commissioners, with Mr.
Stevens, the guardian, co-operated ef
ficiently in the work.
Mr. McAllisterâ Dear Sir: I send through
my son twenty-eight nuggets given to Dr. Le
Conte en the occasion of h!^ golden wedding
by. several of his old pupils in South Africa.
I know that with me they will feel that no
better uÂ«e could be made of them than con
tributing in aid of the Sierra Club Yo^emite
building, and I. take this occasion of ex
pressing through you to the members of the
Sierra Club, and to btneni Interested, my sin
cere thanks for the loving thought whloh ded
icated the building to the memory of my hus
band. Yours truly,

and Ed McKbilay of Dimoml conduct
ed the devltional exercises. . Rev.
E. H. Hadlock and Rev. Dwight E.

To-night at the Athenaeum the clos
ing session began at 6:30 o'clock, and
did not terminate until after 10 o'clock.
Then the delegates began their final
leave-takings. The first of the even
ing's exercises was the convention love
feast, followed by a solo by Miss Alice
G. McMillin of San Jose. When the
roll-call of the various city and county
delegations was called they arose and
responded with testimony, song and
scripture. .
The address of the evening session
was on "The Masteries of Life," by
Rev. A. C. Smlther of Los Angeles.
Following: (fame the closing consecra
tion service. In this the members

ENGAGEMENTS.
If the clever women of the civic sec
tion of the California Club could but
conjure up all the Juvenile digits that
have been "blowed off" by the dia
bolical toy pistol during the last dec
ade and could focus the raggedy first
jingers upon him whose business it
is to suppress it, he might get busy
to enforce the law!
Think of the hundreds of blackened
stumps, the disabled Implements of
toil that are thrust under the noses of
the hospital surgeons for mending
each year on our nation's birthday!
Tht-se thumbs that are blown aft are
jjeeded in the world's work, especially
u It's usually a son of toil who gets
en closest terms with the toy pistol.
The lad who can best afford to part
with a finger or two is not the chap
Who loses it, as papa, or mamma or
r.unty stands nigh to protect him.
It's the little tyke who^e o'er
burdened mother and tired father
p.re too busy â or too indiffer
ent â to watch him and warn
him of his .toy, and bang! â a scream:
the blood spurts, and the burned and
blackened flesh tells the tale. Of
course, he is only a little tyke â he suf
fers his pain like a hero, as becomes
his class, while the surgeon dresses
the wound, and he goes home for a
pcolding and to look out on the valley
of life a cripple. Poor little chap! It
is such as he who needs both his hands,
end they, too. equipped with the full
allotment of digits, to scratch his way
through the world.
One of the remarkable phases of the
mental attitude of the poor is their
indifference to imminent dangers â of
v- hich the fiendish tov pistol and its
Â«<>-dev:I, the blank cartridge, are ex
it mples. It is much the same mental
oblivion that permits young children
to play In the streets, run on errands
across car tracks, and do the various
":-tunts" that almost daily land some
| nor little tyk^ in the morgue â or in
finitely worse, a cripple in a hospital.
Now, the State stands in the atti
tude of protector to the delinquent, the
<! fectlve ar.d the dependent. It is in
ihis capacity that the Government
should protect the babes from the
â¢ iiabolism of firearms in whatever form
they come â the toy pistol the special
object of elimination. When the women
<-r the civic section of the California
<'Iub began to hunt round for some
intihod of stopping this annual crip
j.le-fest, they lit upon a law long since
t rented but apparently wrapt in mum
my c!oths= and laid away.
The statute was* hauled out, dusted.
Bet ur on its feet, and proved to be
quite a pood-looking law, strong and
forceful in its language, and just the
thins the ladies were hunting for, "for
biddiner the sale of toy pistols to min
ors" â wasn't that r!Â»ar enough?
The next stt?3 was to have the
muchly-sought-for law enforced. Now,
this is where the trouble came. The
Â«*iiief of Police, handsome and debon
air, prallantlv sidestepped the proposi
tion, saying that all the stores in town
y.ere selling the play pistols under their
iicr-nse to sell fireworks, and U would
be impossible for him to do anything
in the matter as it stands..
"Cut perhaps the Health Office
would help us," said the chairman of
the delegation, blithely, "because you
know every 'case' makes work for the
doctors in the Emergency Hospital, and
it carries no feesâ not since the ad
ministration got virtuous, you know,
so perhaps the doctors at the City Hall
would help." Here, too, the good
lcxikins Health Officer met the ladies,
Btnfled a witching smile, and declared
ft was not exactly in his line to en
force laws such as that, much as he
would like to, don't you know.
So here we are on the morn of the
p!'.:k'us Fourth calmly awaiting the
dr-eds of jhe day. Count your fingers,
little l^.ds. before you go out this morn
ing, you mightn't have them all to
night- And in case you dcr lose one
or two, or even a piece of one. hurry
v\\ qusk to a doctor, so he can patch
t irp. Many a little iad wer.t*to Davy
Jones' locker because he tied a hand
k-rohiefâ and a Tourth of July hanky
lpri't alvrays cleanâ around the little
his k hole and kept his sorrow to him
s:]f. jr.d he couldn't o**?n his little
Jnvs next day to let in his breakfast.
/.n<J thÂ° r.ext day he didn't need any.
Jf he did. he ate angel's food, while
h* ftax?ped. his wings.
Now. the earnest efforts of the
v â¢ -;Â»r. of the California Club will no
doubt be ridiculed by the Cheerful
Idiot, v ho has set off firecrackers all
hit- !ife without danger to Himself, and
who believes that the action of these
v.omen threatens the very foundation
of the Government by killing off
patriotism:
Is it not time that America has
evolved from the barbaric practice of
measuring her love of country by the
nroount of gunpowder she lets* loose an
the Fourth? Does it inculcate pride
<>f nation, love of her heroes, exalta
tion nf patriotic principles?
The millions of dollars that will go
up to-day and to-night in fireworks
Will l^aVp On ihp mnrrnw (hnnconH. n*
BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
He who had the priceâ and Incident
ally the time â fled tha bomb-stricken
city for the perilous period of the na
tion's birthday. Alas! alas! When will
the American sire teach his son that
firecrackers and patriotism are not
synonymous? However, the small boy's
villainies contribute to the transporta
tion companies' prosperity, for the peo
ple poured out of town in battalions by
boat and train. Lucky people!

POSTUM CEHEAL.
TWO STEPS.
Tlir Last One Helps the First.
A Eick coffee drinker must take two \
Fteps to be rid oi his troubles and get '
Btrozur and well again.
The first is to cut off coffee abso- \
lately. That removrs the destroying!
element.
The next step is to take liquid food!
fand that is Postum Food Coffee) that |
has in it the elements nature requires i
to change the blood corpuscles from '
pale pink or white to rich red, and good !
red blood builds good, strong and
healthy ce!!s in place of the broken-
down cells destroyed by coffee. With
well-boiled Pcstum Food Coffee to shift â¢
to, both these steps are ea.Â«y and pleas- j
ant_ The experience of a Georgian !
proves how important both are: ;
â¢'Frcm 1872 to the year 1900 my wife
and I had both been afflicted with sick I
or nervous headache, and at times we j
suffered untold agony. We were coffee
drinkers and did not know how to get
away from it. for the habit is hard to
quit.
"But in 1900 I read of a case similar
to ours where Postum Coffee was used
in place of the old coffee and a com- ]
plete cure resulted, bo I concluded to
get EOir.e and try it.
"The result was. after three days 1 use
of Postum in p!ace of the coffee I never '
had a symptom of the old trouble, and !
in five months I had gained from 145
pounds to 163 pounds..
"My friende asked me almost dally
what wrought the change. My answer j
always is, leaving off coffee and drink- I
ing Pectum in its place.
"We have many friends who have
been benefited by Postum.
"As to whether or not I have stated
the facts truthfully, I refer you to the
Bank of Carro*ton or any business firm I
in that city, where I have lived* for!
many years and am well known." Name Â»

Alligator Farms.
The French are to have an alligator
farm. Several French capitalists re
cently visited this country to purchase
a few head of stock with which to
start It. The point selected for' the
venture is somewhere In the south of
France. The French prize the alli
gator's skin so highly that the leather
dealers believe It will pay to raise the
animals directly cm home soilâ or, more
properly, In home waters. If they suc
ceed It will be the first farm of its
kind in the world.
Alligator skin is daily growing rarer
and more high-priced, while the de
mand for it continues on the increase.
The French require large quantities
of it for shoes, bags, portfolios and
toilet articles. President- Ixrubet, not
long ago, received aÂ« a gift an entire
hunting Buit made of the finest skins
obtainable. - . ' - . . . . :
PLANTAIN â Subscriber, Alameda.
Cal. The plantain or plantain tree is
one of the food products. It is one of
the most, important of the tropical
countries and one of the most valu
able of the largest of herbaceous
plants > of the natural order of
museae. It is a native of the Ea3t
Indies, where numberless varieties
have been cultivated for thousands of
years. It is now diffused over all
tropical and subtropical regions of the
globe. With "the exception of two or
three plants it would not be easy to
name in the whole vegetable kingdom
any plant applied to a greater number
of uses than the plantain. The frott
is eaten sometimes raw, though more
generallyâ except that of the banana
boiled or roasted, and variously pre
pared. - It Is both farinaceous and
saccharine. In most of the varieties it
has a sweetish taste; in some It^ts
mealy; in some it is sub-acid or asture.
It is as much used before being perfect
ly ripe as when It is so. In the West
Indies the plantain boiled and beaten
In a mortar is the common food" or
the nesrroes. Plantains baked in the
skin or fried in slices with butter and
powdered over with sugar are favorite
dishes in some tropicaf countries.
MARRYING â H. C. C, Selad Val
ley, Cal. When a girl attains the ase
of 18 in California she attains her ma
jority and is a sole agent. She is at
liberty to marry the man of her choice,
providing he has attained his majority,
and the parents have "no legal right
to Interfere in the matter and prevent
their daughter from living with the
man she married."
AMERICAN' FLAG â S. H. S., City.
There is at this time no law prohibit
ing the use of the American flag for
advertising purposes. One house of
Congress passed a law to that effect,
but it did not pass the other house.
At the next session of Congress a
strong effort will be made to have
such a law passed.
Self-Explanatory.
The Postmaster General is said to
have received the following succinct
and self-explanatory communication:
YAM HILL., Ark.. 190â.
Dear Sir: I take my pen In hand to
let you know that I hereby resign, for
the 'leventh and last time, the job of
postmaster at this- place. Mebby you'll
recollect that I've done resigned ten
conseckertive times before. Once it
was b'cuz the emollients of the office
was too puny for the responsibilities:
and another time it was b'cuz the fleas
was tco plenty. Upon a different occa
sion It was for the reason that an im
patient sort of feller that takes the
only Little Rock daily that comes to
this office got to shootin* at me b'cuz
he wanted his blamed paper before I
was through readin' it. Once It was
b'cuz one of them Northerners that
think they are so infernal smart wrote
a postal card to a gent hare sayin* that
the full details of that there scandal
were as follows, and then put the rest
of it in Latin or some such heathenish
language. Another time it was on ac
count of a batch of skunks rendevoozin*
under the edifice until you could almost
cut the atmasfearik disturbance with
tho flat side of a barrel stave; and
later It was b'cuz an unreasonable cuss
that wanted his mail came In through
the side of the office with an ax, when
he knowed good and well that I was
off on a turkey hunt and would be back
in two, three days; and the rest of
'em was on account of one little thing
and another that don't specially matter
at this stage of the game.
As T said before, I have done resigned
ten times already: also, the Government
wouldn't let me off on ary occasion. In
view of which I wish to remark that
it's no picnic to have a job that you
can't quit, although I am ready to own
up that I reckon the reason Is that I'm
the only gent in the community that
could read and write and at the same
time was fool enough to take the of
fice.

WHILE two of the powers of , the earth are
joined in battle in the Far East and the world
looks .eagerly on, two other big nations are'
occupied in some fighting which has much less of glamour
about.it, but which bids fair to be quite as stubborn on
a limited scale as the Russo-Japanese conflict. In the
German province of Southwest Africa Kaiser William's
forces are making but indifferent headway against naked
savages, the Hereros. Away up on the heights of the
Himalayan plateau the British Indian regulars are being
held jn check by barbarous Tibetans.
While the civilized world startles at the news of battle
ships being blown out of the water, whole companies
wiped out by the explosion of Shimose shells and towns
assailed with guns that throw masses of steel twelve
and fourtee, miles, an instructive chapter' in the art of
modern warfare is being written in African jungle
and Tibetan steppe. Â¦ There this same vaunted perfection
in the science, of killing, which seems to prove its title
in such a terrible way between combatants of the civ
ilized world, makes but a lamentably weak showing.
Before the Hereros, with their savage lacking of all
semblance of military skill, the goose-step of the Ger
mans has come to an indefinite "mark time"; the
Tibetans and their leather cannons have brought Gen
eral Macdonald's Ghurkas to a fitting realization of the
task cut out for them. -\
; In each instance the punitive incursions against, bar
barous peoples have been undertaken in the face of
great natural disadvantages. In Africa the Germans
have to fight their way against the stubborn resistance
of the jungle, ignorant of the country, and a prey to all
the dread diseases of miasmatic swamp and tropic fever
ground. The Hereros are crafty as they are bloodthirsty
and have already trapped their foes again and again.
Upon the road to Lhassa the British have even a harder
row to hoc. Over passes that are as, high as 'the loftiest
Sierra, where even/' a horse trail is dangerous/ the
Tibetan expedition has had to 'drag, its ever increasing
line of communication. And the Tibetans are armed
with Russian guns; they can shoot accurately "and
swiftly. :.
Against the deadly perfection of the war game as it is
now being exhibited in the Far East these two incidents
shadow forth a circumstance somewhat anomalous.
Were England and Germany to fly at each . other's
throats cither the one or the other would inflict crush
ing defeat 'and the issue would probably be quickly de
cided. , In Africa, in Tibet, where"; the\f6rces;of their re
spective arms are ; brought to bear upon the remnants
of savagery, there is a pause; the savage will not down.
The Kite in Life Saving.
Of late the kite has emerged from
the position r.-f a 'mere toy, and has
been successfully employed for meteor
ological observations at high altitudes.
A still more recent application "of the
kite principle is as a life-saving: ap
paratus to be carried on shipboard, Its
particular duty being to establish com
munication between a stranded vessel
and the adjacent shore. It stands .to
reason that a ship in this position gen
erally has the assistance of the wind
in carrying anything shoreward, and It
would be far easier to launch a kite
under such conditions than it would
be to fire a rocket In the reverse di
rection.
The kite carries a guide rope and
contains In a pocket a set of signals
and instructions. It is also furnished
with apparatus for telephonic com
munication between the crew and their
would-be rescuers.
This life-saving kite is the Invention
of Count Brossard, who iÂ« to be re
garded as an amateur rather than a
professional man of science. Critics of
his Quaint appliance, while admitting
its general utility, have questioned
whether telephonic communication
would be possible in a bowling tempest.
The kite is said, however, to have been
recently tested with complete success
at London and at Brest.

means of restoring the appearance of
pianos: "Take equal proportions of
turpentine, linseed oil and vinegar,
mix; rub in well with a piece of flan

tirely remove the dingy appearance
thaf age gives to fine woods."
THE Commercial Club of Portland, in an attempt
to give a great advertisement to Oregon, has de
vised a scheme of> cash prizes and medals to be
awarded for the best article or story written by any resi
dent of Oregon, to be published in any newspaper out
side of Oregon prior to October 1, 1904. While this
competition is open to 'all persons the school children
have been notified that they are eligible to win prizes
under the conditions provided. In other words, the
children niaj' be utilized as promoters for the benefit of
their native State.
There is enough of novelty in this idea to attract at
tention. It has a chance to work out well. There are
in every community precocious young people who have
some knack or other in a degree that is potent to sur
prise their elders. Children as competitive boomers of
Oregon will be assisted by all their competent relatives
to give good account of themselves.. Every one re
members the wonderful boy, Thomas Chatterton, as a
literary landmark and more than nine days' wonder.
Mendelssohn wrote fine music when he was a mere lad;
so did Mozart; and at a tender age Zerah Colburn, math
ematically inclined, performed wonderful mental feats.
History is full of mention of youngsters whose fame has
outlived that of the grave and accomplished adults of
their time. Possibly- Oregon may possess a boy or girl
whose capacity to write something attractive about, the
State approaches a true genius.
In any event the outcome will be watched with curi
osity outside as well as within Oregon. There is this
to be said in favor of the boys and girls of any State.
Under the present school system, facts that are dimmed
in the minds of adults by lapse of years and altered
somewhat by intervening conditions, are familiar topics
in class rooms. The school pupils know ? or have the fa
cilities to find out directly from copious encyclopedias
or elsewhere much about their topic. In addition to
this there are youth, enthusiasm and the spirit of emu
lation keen within them. These are the factors to
be counted on in any line of mental endeavor that does
not call for the exercise of technical knowledge requir
ing years to garner. .
Viewed from another point the idea of- having school
children interested in- helping their own State is good.
Their researches will compel them to learn. They will
read and. discuss and will be the better citizens for what
â¢How the' articles that are written by the Oregonians
are to obtain publication in papers outside of the State'
is not told. Possibly the Commercial Club has not fig
ured that out. Announcement is .made that the success
of any competitor will not- depend upon the, class of
publication in which it shall appear. It is intimated
that the competitors should write for some Eastern
paper, the selection to be; in towns in which present
Oregonians formerly resided. There are numerous small
papers in the United States that might use the, matter

CHILDREN AS PROMOTERS.
Uncle Sam has been kind enough to make a very
liberal allowance of money for the National Guard of
California. This decision is a compliment to the citizen
soldiery of the State and a just tribute from the Federal
Government. The National Guard of California was the
first body of American troops ever to leave the conti
nent on a mission of war, and in the field our State troops
fought as regulars for the dignity and supremacy of the
flag.
Life in Old Missouri.
The Webb City correspondent of the
Kansas City Journal sends this "be
lated but interesting item" regarding a
storm which took place near Neck
City a few days ago: "J. N. Scott was
not at home on the night of the storm
last week, having gone to a neighbor's,
some little distance away, and was pre
vailed upon to stay all of Thursday
night on account of the threatening
weather. When he arrived af what
should nave been his home the next
morning he found that his new two
room house had entirely disappeared
and not a trace of it was visible any
where in the vicinity. Hia shaving
mug and brush, which were in the
house at the time of the storm, have
been found in a tree two miles away."
Floivcrs on Stormy Billows.
My friend, the knowing, said In a gloom-
filled hour:
"Who bids the rose to grace In the fall
our pathway?
Who forth on stormy billows would cast
a flower?
WhY;n thunder rolls, who lists to the
birds of May-day?
"Let sor.g birds cease to carol when
storms are singing.
Now drum and cannon sound through
the streets and alleys.
In forests grow the swords and I hear
their ringing.
Downtrodden lies the flowers in Fin
land's valleys.
"When darker grows the sky and the
storm clouds lower.
And men with hand on sword stand
their homes defending.
How can a child's frail arm meet the
giants' power?
How to the jrenlle breeze should the,
cliffs be bending?"
I said: "Yet wounds shall heal after
battle's hour.
Swords rust, and bayonets on the field
lie scattered;
But e'er returns the song as the springra
sweet power,
Forevermore heart's longing shall rise
unfettered.
"Amid the battle's din have the tones
alighted:
Now floats the red, sweet rose on the
â¢ stormy billows.
To waft a summer thought to the mind
benighted
And bloom, a new-born hope, neath
the weeping willows.
"So shall the cliffs be moved by a loving
power.
So shall wild autumn's storm come
with fragrance laden.
So shall the mild tones fall as a May
blcom shower
And gladden yet the heart of dear
Finland's maiden."

Block System Exhibit.
The German Government railroad ex
hibit at the St. Louis fair shows the
block system and switch signals now
in use in Germany. More than 1500
feet of track. In the construction of
which both iron and wooden ties were
used, have been laid. There are a sta
tion house, two switch towers and one
Intermediate block signal post. Ona
of the switch towers is fitted with me
chanical and one with electrical signal
apparatus. . The block system makes
it impossible for a train to run into
an open 'switch or for one train to run
down another between stations. The
double track system prevents colli
sions. By means of electrical appar
atus all switches except the one open-
Ing the desired track are locked, mak
ing an error on the part of the switch
man impossible. AÂ» the last wheel of
the train passes, the switches are all
released by rail contact, making way
for the next train. At intervals of
about seven miles are placed inter
mediate block posts, with a similar
signal and switch apparatus. By auto
matic arrangement the levers are all
locked, so that one train cannot leave
the station until the train ahead has
passed the next post, thus preventing
one train 'from runninjr down another.
All the material used in construction
was brought from Germany.â New

Laic's Delay in Germany.
A recent consular report from Berlin
contains some instructive data upon
the law's delay in Kaiser Wilhelm's
empire. The Consul has this to say:
"The highest Judicial authority of the
German empire is vested in the Reichs
gericht. a Federal Supreme Court es
tnWished pursuant to the law pf April
11, 1877, as one of the institutions re
sulting from the creation of the hew
empire, or confederation of states, af
ter the Franco-Prussian war of 1870
71. The accumulation of business in
the court is such that appeals cannot
reach a hearing short of from nine to
twelve months, and this condition is
declared by both laity and the legal
profession to be intolerable. Thus it
would appear as if the people of this
country are seemingly quick to deplore
those partial denials of justice Involved
in the delays thereof which the citi
zens of the I'nited States have endured
more or les? patiently for many years.
"The steady accumulation of busi
ness in this court and a consequent
falling behind in Its efforts to dispose
of such increase has led to renewed
propositions for the relief of such con
gestion, one or more of which will with
certainty be ultimately enacted into
national law. The first suggestion
made v.as for a further increase in the
number of Judge? and of the sub-di
visions of the court, but it Is urged
that the practical limit in that regard
has already been reached, if not over
stepped. Seemingly, the most practical
suggestion, and that which is likely to
prevail In the end, is a limitation of the
right to appeal in all cases of mere
money Judgments to those in which
the amount Involved exceeds, say, 3000
marks ($714), by which limitation. It is
reliably estimated, fully. 90 per cent of
the appeals now sued out in such
causes will fall away. It is purposed
to raise this limit if occasion should
arise. As a matter of abstract princi
ple the latter suggestion is opposed, be
cause it would tend to make this tri
bunal "the rich man's court," from the
portals of which the man of small
means would henceforth be turned
away, and because the importance to
the individual of a legal controversy
should not be gauged by a mere resort
to, marks and pfennigs. The whole
subject is being so thoroughly dis
cussed, both in the legal magazines of
Germany and in conventions of law
yers, that as soon as the divergent?
views shall have been crvstalllzedl into
definite propositions action can' be
looked for from the Reichstag."
THE question of race suicide recently brought into
prominence in this country by President Roosevelt,
and by the fierce denunciation by President Jacob
Gould Schurman of Cornell University of men graduates
of colleges who ''deliberately elect , bachelordom" is of
renewed interest in view of statistics lately compiled
showing that men are far from being the only offenders
in that regard. In fact, the record shows that college
women commit the sin of matrimonial omission even
more do the men.
Whether the cause for it is that. the chance of being
mistress of a household with its unesthetic cares of the
kitchen and other homely duties is less attractive' to the
cultured college girl than freedom therefrom with a love
less life in professional or other channels is not known.
Or whether the prevailing idea that children arc becom
ing more and more unwelcome, as evidenced by the "no
children" signs put on city residences by discriminating
landlords, acts as a deterrent upon the educated girl, is
likewise difficult to learn.
At all events, that the Eastern college girl is less
prone to give herself in marriage than the Eastern col
lege man is to take her is evidenced by the following
figures gathered by the secretaries of the principal
women's colleges in the East. They 'show a variation
of from one in six girl graduates married to one in two
married, or an average of only about one out of three:
College â - . Graduates. Married.
Radcliffe . .654 108
Baltimore 446 92
Holyoke 2696 1358
Wellesley 1SG0 457
Bryn Mawr 517 86
Totals .
Theabove shows Mount Holyoke far in the lead of
the other colleges, with about one graduate in two mar
ried. Wellcsley about one in four, Baltimore about one
in five and Bryn Mawr and Radclitfe about one in six.
That is a much more astonishing showing than the
one recently made by Harvard men, who averaged about
72 per cent married. President Eliot of that college
points out the serious fact that the educated portion of
the American people not only fails to increase the
population at all, but docs not even reproduce itself. He
gives as the reason in part the fact that the protracted
education necessary for the professions delays marriage
beyond the ordinary time. limit.
President Briggs of Radcliffe in speaking of the sub
ject says: "Of course the college woman is less likely
to marry than the one who has no desire for study and
has nothing else to take up her mind. The women who
come to college prefer the fortune which an educated
woman has before her in the various professions to a
life of dependence. Then, too, college women may be
more fastidious about the men whom they marry.. In
short, it seems to me that the reports from, the various
women's colleges show that women graduates are in
fluenced by much the same reasons that are affecting
all women to a more or less degree â the tendency to eco
nomic independence rather than turning to matrimony
for support.''
It would be interesting to compare with the East the
proportion of women graduates from our two California
universities who have married, but we know of no sta
tistics at present available for the purpose.
Torpedo Culture.
At one time I was engaged in torpe
do culture. I was not the gentle scien
tist who was then evolving this ful
minating arbiter of nations from the
pijreon- holes of his brain into the ac
tivities of perfect warfare. I was only
cn<- of the t-taff of attendants of an
Infant CestSned one day in Its adult
ttood to burrow into battleships. This
militant baby was my charge ashore,
v '.li!" a b!g 5>roT\n kanaka sailor, who
could overhaul a pcrpoise In its native
b::ne, h-'ided the small son of Mars at
rea. IJ<j was its wet nurse.
Our charge was a veritable little
devil A full-fledged destroying angel
of flarkness. Even at that extreme
Juvenile period it appeared to possess
tliÂ«* soul of Cain and a deathless desire
to get on some marine firing line.
Iwrsirs ?nd training infant torpedoes
T.1S not. with me, a labor nf love nor
cf my own volunteering. During that
warm summer in the tropics I had a
special Quakerish reluctance to labor
in tt< perfection of Implements for the
tfestJ-uction of humanity and a general
â and stronger â reluctance to do any
thing. Consequently T was rather in
clinf-c! stealthily to undo the inventor's
*ork and crush the future ship
fcmasher in the eRjr, as it were.
My chief was Captain John A. How
ell. U. S. X. (now admiral, retired), the
"father of thÂ« Howell torpedo." and I
was a very young: sailor on board the
vessell he then commanded. As I acted
as his clerk my duties kept me much
of the time in his cabin, where he was
at work on his model. It was about
as large as an ordinary salmon and
when its machinery got speeded up
was about as full of life. The captain
would fill the big cabin bathtub with
water and In this he schooled his child
of war. He was a very religious man
was Captain Howell and acted as
chaplain every Sunday, as' his ship did
not officially rate one. In the pictur
esque diction of the sea. she didn't
carry enough gun* to rank a sky-pilot.
On week days the captain would fill
the tub, launch his torpedo and call
me from my desk to hold the little
monster whie he made delicate altera
tions in rudder or propeller. Then we
would have lots of fun with that buzz-
Ing, splashing thing. With Its clock
work wheels whirling away and its
rmall body plunging fore and aft in
the tub it woud make frantic efforts
to pet out and find something to fight.
The skipper and I generally came out
of these encounters with hands and
arms scratched and wet from keel to
truck.
So, owing to my being closely asso
ciated with Captain Howell In his sci
entific work (my desk was alongside of
his tub), he got in the habit of taking
me with him when he pave the young
ster an airing, or rather a watering, in
the bay. The big kanaka, all stripped
for a swim, and I with the model un
der my arm would march aboard the
Eleam launch In the wake of the cap
tain amid the sly grins and joshings of
the men. who called us "the torpedo
kindergarten." We would find a shal
low stretch of water of about ten feet
in depth and drop the future rruiser
killer. The convoying kanaka would
f.ounder overboard after it and we
Â¦would steam after them. Often the tor
pedo would dive to the bottom, and he
Â¦would follow and haul the trnant back
to school and the surface.
Shermanâ that was his name on the
chip's books, as the one his mother
gave him back in sunny Ililo was too
long and too unpronounceable for prac
tical use â was solid with the skipper.
He got grifts of many dollars and extra
liberties on shore, where he could spend
both to his peculiar liking, and that
vas drinking. When the torpedo was
more unmanageable than usual, neces
sitating more swimming:' and more div
ing, the captain generously doubled the
dollars and liberties, and Sherman
doubled the drinks. I sometimes
thought that there was a job put up
between the kanaka and the torpedo
down on the botjbm of the sea to make
those trials as difficult as possible for
Sherman's personal benefit. However,
Â»hen the sailor was sleeping oft his
shore dissipation up under the fore
castle the torpedo and I had our trials
in the tub.
Still. I firmly believe in its mechan
ical heart the torpedo fairly hated the
kanaka, and every steel spring of its
email murderous soul was bent to his
undoing. It would not only hide from
him in the deepest and darkest places
it could find, but it would try^" to run
him down. Off it would go from the,
launch, the tiny propellers churning up
the bubbles and he following them as
they rose to the surface, when it would
suddenly veer away at right angles to
its course and for a few minutes be lost
to Sherman's X-ray ken. Then, while
he v.as diving through the water
searching for the runaway, It would
find him. With all the power of Its
buzzing machinery it would plunge its
Eharp snout Into his naked body or rake
the skin from his kicking: legs with its
whirling propeller?. Then that fright
ened kanaka would give a yell of ter
ror and make the, water fairly boil in
his drive for the launch. I could al
ways satisfy him that bis assailant was
only a playful porpoise or a curious
shark, neither of which be feared, and
get him to find the torpedo, then rest
ing contentedly and enjoying the fruits
of its victory down In the mud. . Of
course, it was only a powderleas ma
chine, an e&rnetst of danger" to come,
but It? nose was sharp, its aim uner
rins, its spirit unchristian and it was
CO-EDS AND RACE SUICIDE.
Some surprise has been expressed at the political jug
glery of the Board of Health in dismissing many em
ployes under one official designation, which has repre
sented their usefulness to the community, and then re
appointing them to office under another name conve
niently secured. The affair is simpler than at first glance
appears. No change in duties has been made. The trans
ferred deputies had nothing to do in their old positions
and have nothing more to perform in their new field of
political favor.
as much at home in the water as was
Sherman.
One day while in submarine flight
it made a sharp turn and joyfully
'swung into the kanaka's starboard
row of ribs. The seal-brown sailor
thought a swordfish had struck him
below the waterline and kicked fran
tically at the model which, urged
ahead by its little propellers, was
ramming him again and again. Sher
man, sure that all his compartments
were flooded, retreated for the launch
while the torpedo bobbed serenely to
the surface, looking for more kanakas
to lick in fair open flKht.
Only by convincing the timid island
er that it was a swordftsh and not a
malicious baby torpedo that had
tried to mine him could I Induce
Sherman to go on any more subma
rine trial trips. But the captain
neede.d him and the flash of several
$5 nieces overcame his fear of fellow
i swimmers down in the vasty deep.
J So ho parsed the summer drinking

pedo at sea. When the kanaka was
' too drunk for scientific deep sea work
out in the bay, I shifted into seml

TOM GREGORY.
ONCE more the people Of the United States are
called to the observance of the anniversary of
Â«, the day upon which the thirteen British colonies
in North America declared their independence of the
British crown and empire and thereby laid the founda
tions of the great republic that now holds a foremost
place among the powers of the earth. .
It is a day so full of patriotic -memories that no intelli
gent citizen can fail to feel their influence; nor can the
most indifferent be neglectful of the claims it has upon
his attention and. his reverence.
So far as the making of nations is concerned the
declaration of independence by the thirteen colonies is
by far the greatest single event in human history. It Was
the act, bravely and wisely done at a critical moment, by
which an old order of things was terminated and a new
order of things begun. It was the birth of the America
which we know; the first clear and unmistakable mani
festation of that destiny which has so profoundly af
fected the whole world and in a greater or less degree
shaped the course of national development in every
nation under the sun. \
The men who signed the great declaration were in
character and purpose worthy of the task to which they
set their hands. The maintenance of it in war and in
peace was intrusted to leaders of abilities so high that
only in rare instances can their equals be found in the
annals of history. Americans of this and every other
generation can honor the- memory of the great men of
the Revolution tor their personal worth as well as for
the work they performed. Indeed, as much of patriotic
inspiration can be gained, by the American youth from
a study of the characters of Washington, Jefferson and
Adams as from a review of the glory and the greatness
of the republic itself.
It is a matter of profound regret to many that the cele
bration of so glorious a day in the history of the nation
should be conducted in the manner which custom has
established. As a rule, the .general observances of the
day lack decorum, dignity and propriety. The stately
parades, the lofty orations and the patriotic music, which
should be the chief features of the celebration, are too
often lost sight of in the general roar of firecrackers
and other noisy and dangerous forms of popular demon
stration.
That such regrets are in a measure well founded goes
without saying. The fatalities of each successive Fourth
of July are greater than those of many an important
battle, while the frequent fires of each year impose upon
the nation an enormous loss. Sooner br later we shall
devise a remedy for these evils. In the meantime we
must guard against them as best we can.
It behooves us then to give our hearts to-day to a
free and full exultation in the greatness of our country,
cherishing at the same time a profound loyalty to the
memory of the. great men who put their fortunes, their
lives and their sacred honor at stake that the nation
might be founded and that we might be free. It is such
a holiday as is known to no other people. Let us rejoice
in it with a true patriotic fervor and be proud that we
are Americans. â-
Dousing the Glim.

quarter, which was Pat's beat, were
compelled to wend their homeward

But for the lamplighter's son the

made a remark that he did not ' care
to live if somebody else were dead.
"Yesterday afternoon they met in the
store. Trouble ensued and Berglof

INSTRUCTIONS TO DELEGATES.
It is not generally known that the
first out-and-out Republican platform
adopted was passed upon at Jackson,
Mich., in 1854, but such is the case. Cm
the 6th day of July, 1S54, more than
1000 people gathered at Jackson, Mich.,
and nominated a State ticket, which
was headed by Kinley S. Bingham,
candidate for Governor. At the time
the nominations were made a platform
was adopted which contained many of
the basic principles of the Republican
party of to-day. One plank in partic
ular has been passed down to the pres
ent day and is an unwritten law of tha
party, though frequently expressed in
the platforms adopted at the various
conventions throughout the Union. It
is as follows:
Resolved, That in view of the necessity of
battling for the first principles of Republican
government, and against the schemes of an
arlntocracy, the most revolting and oppressive
with which the earth was ever cursed or roan
debased, we will co-operate and be known as
"Republicans" until the contest be terminated.
Many of the delegates to the National
Convention at Chicago will have re
turned by the time Senator Edward I.
Wolfe drops the gavel Wednesday night
and they will attend the anniversary
of the Republican party and assist in
the ratification of the men they helped
to nominate in Chicago.
FIRST PLATFORM.
Thousands of Republicans will be at
the Theater Wednesday
night and each will have on his best
"bibb and tucker," for his mother will
be watching him, or else his wife or
sweetheart will have her weather eye
open to see how he is being received
by the dear people for whom he is
willing to handle politics.
The Alhambra Theater has been dec
orated for to-day's celebration, but on
Wednesday night it will be much more
attractive, for the "Grand Old Repub
lican Party" is to celebrate its birth
day in an elaborate manner. The peo
ple of San Francisco have been Invited
to attend and they will no doubt be out
in force. Ladies are to be special
guests,, and their presence will be an
incentive for the speakers to do their
best, and when the best is attempted
there is always a feast for the intelli
gent.
- This practically disposes of the prop
osition to abandon the policy of recla-
In the second decision It Is declared
that the purchaser of State swamp
lands is not a party to the contract be
tween the State and the United States
relating to reclamation, and that the
appropriation of the proceeds from "the
granted swamp hinds to reclamation
rests solely upon the good faith of the
State. .
, These decisions of the highest tri
bunal of the land set at rest the whole
question as to the legal, right of a State
to now create a swamp land district
and include; within its boundaries .re
claimed and unreclaimed., land, and as
sess all the land so. Included, for'pur
poses of general reclamation^ arid clear
ly discloses the fact that the State pos
sesses no such right. Â¦ -
In the first decision quoted it is de
clared that the obligation of a State to
reclaim the land rests upon the State
alone, and that no trust is thereby at
tached to the land itself, but that the
title to such land when obtained from
the State is not affected by the man
ner In which the State might perform
its duty to the Government.
MEANING OF DECISIONS.
It 1* not competent for the owners of land
which is a part of a grant to a State under
the swamp land act. 9 Stat. 519, to set up
in proceedings begun to enforce a tax on the
land assessed under a State law for the pur
pose of draining and improving it that the
Btate law Impairs the obligation of the contract
betwetn the State and the United States and
so violates the constitution; because (1). If the
swamp land act constituted a contract between
thv State and the United States, he was no
party to It; and (2) the. appropriation of the
proceeds of the granted swamp lands rÂ«Â»tÂ»
solely In the good faith of the State.
In deciding the case of Mills County
vs. Railroad Companies, 107 U. S., 557,
it. was held:
The proviso of the second section of the act,
thit rh" proceeds of the lands shail bÂ» ap
plied exclusively, as far as necessary, to the.
purpone of reclaiming thÂ« same by levees and
drair*. Imposed an obligation which rests upon
th* good faith of the States. No trust was
thereby attached to the lands, and the title to
them, which is derived from either of the
Stales, if. not affected by the manner in which
sh<> rerform*d that obligation.
And again, in Hagar vs. Reclamation
District, 111 U. S.. 701, it was said:
It has been claimed that whoever ac
cepts title to swamp land accepts such
title in subordination to the paramount
'right and duty of the State to cause
the land to be reclaimed by any meth
od It might see fit to employ. If this
contention had been understood to be
true, the liability of expenditure on ac
count of the reclamation of any swamp
land purchased from the State would
never cease 'until the last acre of
swamp and, overflowed land had been
reclaimed. If this doctrine had been
promulgated and believed in from the
first, the State would never have
parted title with one single acre, be
cause, while the economic value of re
claimed portions of the swamp land
might be ascertained, the profitable*
ness of reclaiming it all at the expense
of all was wholly unascertainable. No
one would have attempted the recla
mation of a portion of this land with
the understanding that he was event
ually to be charged with a proportion
ate cost of reclaiming all the other
prramp and overflowed lands of the
State.
But the fact that the swamp lands
purchased from the State are not
charged with the duty or obligation to
reclaim other lands is no longer de
batable or doubtful. Whatever con
struction the decisions of the State
court in this relation may be suscepti
ble of, the decisions of the Supreme
Court of the United States with refer
ence to the meaning of the act granting
swamp and overflowed lands to States
are not ambiguous and obscure.
But this is far from declaring that
the owners of swamp land which has
been reclaimed, who have received pat
ents from the State conveying a title
without conditions, may now be sub
jected to assessments upon their land
for the purpose of reclaiming swamp
land which they do not own.
RULINGS OF THE COURTS.
The decision of the Supreme Court
in the case of Kimball vs. Reclama
tion Fund Commission, by superficial
reading, would seem to hold that Con
gress had by the act granting swamp
and overflow lands to the State im
posed upon the grant itself the condi
tion that the lands be reclaimed. What
the court decided was that, whereas
the Legislature had inaugurated a sys
tem for the reclamation of these lands
by organizing a Board of Commission
ers who were to superintend the work,
and* had provided that in any district
where a petition representing one
third in acres of the tract of land pro
posed to be reclaimed was located, the
appellant was bound in law to take
notice of the public statute and must
be deemed -to have accepted the title
in subordination of the paramount
right and duty of the land to be re
ciaimed; that a general system for the
purpose of reclamation had been in
augurated and that under
the provisions of the law the practical
measures of reclamation had been set
up the owners of land within such dis
trict must submit to assessment for
the reclamation of the land they
owned; that the owner of lands in a
district to be reclaimed could not de
cline to contribute to the cost of such
reclamation and then enjoy the incre
ment which would ensue, but must
contribute equally with other owners
in the same district to the reclamation
cost. - Â¦ .
More than 1,200,000 acres of land
granted to the State of swamp and
overflowed land have been granted to
individuals by patent which convevs
the title without conditions. These
lands, notwithstanding they belong to
the category of swamp and overflowed
lands, are as completely exempt from
special assessment for the reclamation
of other lands as any other lands of
the State. .
Reference has already been made
to the fact that no one possesses suf
ficient information on the subject to
determine, even with a remote prob
ability of accuracy, the economic
value of a reclamation scheme having
for its object the reclamation of all
the overflowed lands belonging to the
State. But beyond this, the question
of the practicability of the scheme
from its legal aspect is worthy of
thoughtful consideration.
QUESTION OF LEGALITY.
been fully demonstrated. Since the
enactment of that law, the swamp
land policy of the State has been the
subject of legislative attention, as the
acts approved on the following dates
fully attest: March 16, 1872;' March
J-'S, 1872; Congressional Resolution,
1878: March 29, 1878; April 1, 1878;
April 23, 1880; March 24, 1S93; March
17, 1S97; March 2, 1901, and March
16, 1901. Notwithstanding these acts,
the general policy underlj-ing the act
of 1868 has not been changed in any
essential feature.
The State was confronted with the
condition, which had been fully dem
onstrated by experiment, that the
valu? of the land when reclaimed was
the only inducement to its reclama
tion. It therefore entered upon the
reclamation of that which was most
readily and economically reclaimable.
leaving the more costly work of rec
lamation to a time when alluvial dep
osition, which was then and is now
steadily in progress, would make the
problem of reclamation more easy,
when, by reanon of the growth of the
commonwealth and the greater dens
ity of its population, the land re
claimed would possess a higher value.
During the discussion which was
the Genesis of the act of 1868.
It-iwaa proposed by some of
the very best minds of the
State to adopt the mound system of
reclamation in use on the lower
course of the NJle. , Xhe late B. B.
Reddimj. to whose patriotism and in
tellectual breadth this commonwealth
is still under obligation, was the lead
ins: -proponent of this Dlan. ,
The wisdom of the act of 1868 has
THE ONLY INDUCEMENT.
Mining was the paramount industry
of the country and the hydraulic
method was in full operation.
Hydrav'ic mining was charging the
tributaries of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers with detritus, which
was being forced down the channels
of these tributaries on a declivity of
100 feet to the mile and into a central
drainage having less than four inches
to the mile. The detritus thus forced
into the channel of the main streams
must necessarily lodge, and the time
at which the Sacramento River in par
ticular would wander at will over the
alluvial bottom land of the valley
could not be foretold.
All commercial and industrial ac
tivities, including agriculture, horti
culture, manufacturing and mer
chandise, were then, merely subordi
nate and allied Industries to mining.
The absence of rail communication
with the East had denied an Eastern
market for the field, orchard and vine
yard products of the State. Hence the
proposition of . arresting the de
struction of the valley by> enjoin
ing hydraulic mining had not been
dreamed of
â¢The rapid filling up of the main
channel of the central drainage con
stituted a menace to successful recla
mation.- The danger was apparent that
the river beds would fill up, that the
flood mnximums would rise, that
reclamation levees would have to be
Increased In ' height and that vast
quantities of mining detritus would be
imposed upon the valley lands.
The cost relating to the reclama
tion of this fifth class was far beyond
the financial possibilities of the time.
The only inducement to the reclama
tion of any of the land was the value
of the land after its reclamation.
There was no source of revenue avail
able for this purpose. The legislative
experiments prior to 1868 had demon
strated this fact beyond all contro
versy. The appeal to State or
Government aid was wholly imprac
ticable. The State was not in a posi
tion financially to enter upon the cost
of reclaiming all its swamp land prop
erty in one general scheme of reclama
tion, because it was apparent then as
now that the cost of such an undertak
ing would exceed $100,000,000, while
the assurance which would have
proffered a request to the Government
to add its munificence by reclaiming
the property it had presented to the
State had not reached the stage of
pauperizing dependence it has attained
in recent times.

5. â L*m:s wholly irreclaimable by any other
method Â»han an absolute control of the
entire hydrographic phenomena of the Interior
bsam af the btate. -
The experience <*< reclamation in old
er countries was appealed to and the
lesson of such experiment was read
into the current discussion of the time.
The policy of attempting a complete
reclamation of all swamp lands by
placing the ultimate value of all such
lands behind the enterprise was reject
ed, because then, as now, the data upon
which the economic value of the policy
could be determined was wholly want
ing. There was not then and is not to
day sufficient information concerning
the cost of reclamation by that plan, or
the economic value of the result, to
justify the undertaking.
The granting act required the Sec
retary of the Interior to make an ac
curate list and plat of all the swamp
lands and transmit these plats to the
Governors of the States being bene
ficiaries of the grant and upon the re
quest of such States, to issue patents
conveying the title in fee-simple. This
had not been done when the people of
California addressed their attention
seriously to the question of reclaiming
these lands in good faith and of add
ing their areas to the- productive
wealth of the State- and the require
ments of the law have not yet been
full- accomplished.
The knowledge of the subject was
general, not specific. It was well
known that the lands were divided by
their physical condition into five nat
ural classes:
1. â Lands overflowed at extreme flood stages
of the rivers and covered with water for a
period so short as to be beneficial rather than
injurious and to be practically a substitute for
.iiinual irrigation. â¢
the framework of the State swamp land
poyey was enacted.
The policy underlying this act was
evolutionary. It was the suggestion
of legislative experiment beginning
with the act quoted, and rising
through the acts of April 25, 1855, April
21. 1SJ8. April IS, 1S39. May 13, 1861,
April 27, 1863, and April 22, 18G6. Each
of these acts underwent preliminary
discussion in the public mind and par
liamentary examination by the Legis
lature. Leading up to the act of 1S68,
the entire question cf swamp land
reclamation was made the subject of
thoughtful examination and public ad
vocacy by the very best minds the
State has ever produced.
The suggestion ot combining all the
swamp land into one reclamation dis
trict and pursuing a system of reclam
ation that would distribute the burden
cf its cost to each acre of swamp land
alike, regardless of the relative re
clamability of the land, is now
brought forward as an original sugges
tion, whereas it was advocated and
traversed until not one grain of wheat
was left in the thrice-threshed straw.
EXPERIENCE IS CITED.
From this bcgJnninE, which related
merely to an experiment with 640 a^res
of 6Â»-amr> land very easily r*clalmable
the subject occurred legislative atten
tion at Intervals until 1S68. when th*
Ceneral act which to-day constitutes
. The State was admitted to the Union
of States on September 9, 1850, and the
Jict in question was passed September
2S. 1850. when the State was only nine
teen days old.
If the obligation of reclamation ar
l'itrariiy accompanied the gift the pro
priety of its acceptance would have
bff n debatable. If not wholly inadvis
able. The conditions attending the
Â¦wamp land? granted were wholly un
known. The economic value of the
grant itself was equally unknown.
Hence ihr people of California could
not have known whether the acceptance
ff the grant accompanied by an ar
bitrary obligation to reclaim all the
Innds granted would not be the as
â¢sumptjon of a task the fulfillment of
which would be, wholly uneconomic, if
r.ot impossible.
NO TIJIK LIMIT MADE.
There was no declaration in the law
and no possible inference to be derived
from it imposing upon the State the
duty to reclaim the land within a given
time or to reclaim all of the swamp
and overflowed lends granted. On the
contrary. It was clearly within the pro
vince of the State to proceed v.'ith such
reclamation In such a manner as to ac
complish the ultimate result at such
t!me and in such v.ay as would be most
advantageous to the State itBclf
-The first act relating to ku amp land
was approved May l. issi, clght months
after the date of the act granting the
land. This act erantcd C40 acres of
Kva'mp land on Mcrritt Island to John
F. Booth and Dnvid Galloway and pro
vided that they should reclaim thÂ« land
bring it tinder cultivation and report
the result to the Legislature. The cau
tious and conservative wisdom of this
act wJH be apparent.
Public policies are founded upon the
arcer twined knowledge and the mor-t
ivgent ieaso:is influencing determina
tion in the minds of men at the time
iiX their adoption. Later, when the
knowledge is becominjj obscure and
\:.~ arsmnc-'.u which prevailed in the

policy iz often summoned to the bur

tain to h^piicn, and since all human
Institutions are impeachable, it is
eminently proper that their wisdom
*nould be reviewed In the strong light
oi experience.
It is sometimes unfortunate that the
assault upon an established policy is
led by persons who are unfamiliar
with the history of legislation relating

STOKY OF THF. GRANT.
liy act of Congress, approved Sep
tember 2S. 1S50. the State o-f California
received approximately 1.500.000 acres
of swamp and overflowed lands. The :
act itself declared that the donation
was made "to enable the several States i
to construct the necessary levees and
drains to reclaim the swamp and over- \
flowed lands therein." The act then
proceeds to declare:
It fchall be the duty of the Serretary of the
Interior to make accurate lists and plats of
all fu<-h lands, and transmit th; same to the
Gororcora of the several States in which said
iÂ»ndÂ» tray lie. and at the request of the Gov
Â«-n:Â»r of Â«ny Â£tate In which raid evmnn< and
MaSur lands may be. to cauye patents to be
ihnw-d to ttiti Stat-i- therefor, conveying to said
Slate the fre-?imple of raid lands.
Th* jjro*-e*-ris of "raid lands made from Bale
ot by tlircct appropriation in kind, shall be
applied exclusively, ac far as necessary, to
i Â¦Â¦Â¦ a.mlng taid lands by nitans ot teveea and
dra'jM.
The foregoing excerpts present the
letter of the law. It is of the highest
importance that the terminology em
ployed should have careful consider
ation. I
The first paragraph quoted declares
that the Secretary of the Interior shall
make lists and plats o-f the lands and
r.t the request of the viovernor of any
State, shall cause patents to be issued
Ur the State, "conveying to said State
the fee-simple of said land." The stat
ute itself plainly declares that the
patent issued by the Government of
the United States shall convey a title
in fee simple and this Is the full equiv
alent of declaring that the title is pass
ed by the patent without condition.
But the second paragraph quoted en
joins upon the State the policy of ap
plying the proceeds derived from the
t^ale of the land to the reclamation of
the land? themselves by the construc
tion of levees and drains.
PROVISION XOT MANDATORY.
The provision that the proceeds of
the sale snould be applied exclusively,
so far as necessary, to the reclamation
"f the swamp lands was advisory and
r.ot mandatory-. This statement must
be accepted as conclusive since the act
itself declares that the Government
patent conveys "to the said State the
ff-e simple of the land" Any reserva
tion or exception on the part of the
Government was necessarily cut off by
the issue of the patent, while at the
fame time it may be freely admitted
that the whole transaction has the col
or of a grant foT purposes of reclam
ation. This is. however, not to be con-
Ftrued as a declaration that such
reclamation is a condition precedent
to.^the receipt of title or that the fail
ure to reclaim shall work a forfeiture
of such title.

MICH LGAN HAS H0N01I
James B. Eads, the distinguished hy
draulic engineer, who was brought to
this State by the commissioners ap
pointed under the act of April 23, 1880,
in an able and exhaustive report de
clared that the multiplication of chan
nels reduced the drainage capacity of
a stream.- He showed that the division
of the channel of a stream augmented
the friction which resists a current,
whereas confining the stream to a
single adequate channel induced the
formation of a hydraulic prism, which
is the form insuring the maximum of
flow with the minimum of friction.
The revival of past theories i3 ac
companied' by a proposition to con
struct what was known as the Monte
zuma canal. This means a canal from
Greys Bend, above the mouth of Feath
er River on the Sacramento, through
the Yolo-Solano x Tule Basin and
through a canal cut through the Mon
tezuma Hills into Suisun Bay. This
proposition underwent the most rigid
engineering inquiry at the expense of
the State and at the hands of Engineer
Smith, whose experience as a hydraulic
engineer was acquired in the service
of the British Government in India
when the national irrigation systems
of that country were constructed. His
report condemned the scheme as
wholly impracticable. While the rea
sons for this conclusion were retained
in the popular mind, the Montezuma
canal was deemed an impossibility. Its
specter rises as the invaluable litera
ture relating to it is forgotten.
The propositions now brought for
ward are prompted by the most pub
lic-spirited and patriotic motives.
From the standard of motive, they are
worthy of the highest commendation.
They are not amenable to the charge
of having been mooted by individuals
or any class of individuals, or promot
ed by any special class of property
owners, but they violate the maxim
that the present must be a continuation
of the settled principles and ascer
tained knowledge of the past if it is to
have profitable continuity with the fu
ture. In the evolution of the policy of
reclamation there is in existence a
copious literature. In 1874, acting un
der the instruction of the government
and in pursuance of joint resolution of
Congress, the government engineers
made 1 a - hydrographic survey of the
State of California. This survey was
conducted by Colonel Alexander, under
whose Immediate direction the data
was compiled and the Invaluable maps
drawn. The report treated the whole
subject of irrigation, reclamation and
drainage. Its salient recommendation
was the construction of a canal skirt
ing the foothills between the moun
tains and the level land of the interior
basin and the transfusion and equali
zation of the flow of all the affluents
of the San Joaquin and Sacramento
valleys. \
The report, of Engineer Smith with
accompanying maps on the Montezu
ma Hills canal: the report of James
B. Eads, special consulting engineer,
on the drainage of the Sacramento val
ley; the various reports of State
Engineer William Hammond Hall and
his assistant, C. E. Grunsky â these
with the reports of the State swamp
landi commissions at various times,
have' cost the State in the aggregate
nearly $500,000. It is a sad commentary
on the method in which these costly
instrumentalities of popular education
have been preseived that their irref
ragable conclusions are no longer a
guide to public opinion. Â¦, .
mation by districts, and substitutes for
it a single reclamation system, embrac
ing all of the lands, reclaimed and un
reclaimed, in one general system.
Considerations of brevity forbid any
further examination of the propositions
which have been mooted in this paper.
The present purpose will have been ac
complished by calling attention to the
fact (hat with the revival of the old
abandoned theory of a general reclam
ation system or none, theories long
since relegated to disuse by scientific
inquiry are revived. For instance, the
idea of the multiplicity of channels as
a relief for maximum flood conditions
Is brought forward with all the com
placenqy that would be manifested if
the utter inutility of that method was
not far within the range of ascertained
knowledge.
ENGINEERS' TESTIMONY.
Fiftieth Anniversary of the
Party's Birth to Be Time
for 0 feat Demonstration
THE vast Importance of the reclamation of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin river lands led to the recent river convention
and the appointment of n committee to formulate practicable
measures. 1 Many members of that convention favored the proposal to
assess all the swamp lands alike for the cost of reclamation. This
plan is vigorously attacked by Mr. 31111s in the article printed below,
which will be found replete with cogent] reasoning, based on the
history of California reclamation work and the legislation and litijra
lion Uuit have covered half a century. Mr. Mills' noteworthy paper
will receive the attention it deserves from all who are interested in
the development of California's areas of overflowed lands.

Antonio Jerald, by his own story, is the
local prize fisherman up to date, and he
brought along the fish to substantiate his
statement. Yesterday, while crabbing off the
wharf at Sausallto, .he netted a big green cod.
Exercising the utmost care, he succeeded in
landing hia catch on the pier. The fish In* its
struggles entangled itself In the crab net and
several times bit Its captor before it was se
cured. It weighed --twenty-five pounds when
dressed and is by far the largest green cod
ever caught in the bay.
Prize Green Cod.
The necessary depth is thirty feet, but In
very few places is the Water so deep. Eight
een and twenty feet of water is a fair aver
age, while in some of the slips fourteen and
fifteen feet will mark the depth. In the quiet
waters among the wharves the precipitation
from the rivers and sewers is always consid
erable, but this year the dump from these
sources has been grearer than usual.
The dredger crews have decorated their craft
with flags and bunting and will celebrate while
they shovel along the bay bottom.
The State of California is taking advantage
of the shortage of ships in this port to scaap
the mud out .of ,the docks along the water
front. Many of the slips are empty and the
three dredgers are working night and day.
Sundays and holidays alike the big steam
shovels go down and up, digging out the
debris from the bottom of the bay. To-day
the crews of the huge machines will hear the
â¢'Elorious Fourth" crackling and booming all
around them. The bands will blare and the
toy pistol will roar while they tear up the
mud from the dock beds.

San Francisco harbor is noted in sons
and storv as the .world's fleet holder â
a bay capable of gathering within -its
rocky gates at once all the ships that
sail the oceans of the globe. Just now,
however, very few deep-water vessels
are moored^in the bay. Yesterday a soli
tary ship, a three-masted schooner Just
as lonely, a steam collier, lonesome and
coal-dusty, and a scow looking lost and
forgotten, swung at their chains. These
were in the lower part of the harbor,
while the northern portion was empty
from city shore to Marin and Contra
Costa flats.
There are, however, 142 vessels hurry
ing under sail or steam from foreign
ports bound for this bay. A number
of them are overdue. One of these, the
ship Montebello, is 177 days from Swan
sea with a reinsurance of 15 per cent.
The British ship Greta is 27 days from
Honolulu â se.ven to nine days longer
than the ordinary run from that port.
The bark Kaiulani is twenty-four
days from the same place. She often
makes the trip in eighteen. The Brit
ish ship Stanley Dollar is nineteen days
from Hakodate and slightly overdue.
Two more vessels due from the Hawai
ian ports are the schooner H. C. Wright
and the bark R. P. Rithet, both twenty
days out. The British Totmes is due,
ninety-four days from Hamburg., Her
coal cargo took fire the first part of
the voyage and she was forced back
to port. This gives her leeway- and off
the overdue list. The British ship Wa
vertree is 144 davs from Newcastle,
England, while the ship General de
BoisdefTre is 151 days out from Swansea.
Other ships are the Wanderer, 163 days
from Antwerp, the Dunbrldge, 141 days
from Hamburg, and the Russian ship
Glenard.'137 days from Dunkirk.
One of the overdues has given an am
ple reason for her misfortune and she
may be called the unlucky craft of the
fleet. This is the British ship Bayonne,
now 2G8 davs out from Dunkirk. On
December 12, 1903, she put into Mon
tevideo with rigging and spars dam
aged. Her captain was lost at sea
during a' terrible gale. She was de
layed in that port until May 10, 1904.
The ship Routenburn is 19S days out
from Newcastle, England. On Jauary
16 she arrived at Queenstown in dis
tress, with deckhouse stove in, sails
blown away and cabin flooded. She
sailed February 26 for San Francisco.
Of the overdue ships for reinsurance
the Juteopolis, Queen Elizabeth, La
Rochefoucald and Largo Law are
posted at 7 per cent; the Sierra Mi
randa at 10, the Wvnford and Monte
bello at 15 and the Norwegian bark
Parknook, 137 davs out from Chitta
gong for Trinidad, at 40 per cent.

M0NTEBELL0EEINSUEED
The act providing for the construc
tion of the American scouts reads as
follows: "Three scout cruisers, of not
more than 3750 tons trial displacement,
carrying the most powerful ordnance
of vessels of their class; to have the
highest speed compatible with good
cruising qualities and great radius of
action, and to cost, exclusive of arma
ment, not exceeding $1,800,000 each."
The total cost of each vessel is esti
mated at $2,200,000 according to figures
furnished by the several bureaus in the
Navy Department, the details of which
together with those of the British scout
Sentinel are! given in the following
table:
American. British.
Cost â 3750 tons. 2900 tons.
Hull and machinery. $1,800,000 00, $1,330, 735 00
Armament 375,000 00 47,110 00
Kquipment*. ........ ' 25,000 00 - ..."..;..
Incidental charges.. 22,225 00
The armored cruisers North Carolina
and Montana are to be of the same
general design as the California class
of six ships designed in 1S99, which are
13,680 tons displacement on a mean
draught of 24 feet 1 inch. .The two
proposed ships are to have a displace
ment of 13.800 tons on 24 feet 6 inches
draught, 22 knots speed and their ten
tative main batteries will consist of
four 8-inch and fourteen 6-inch guns,
and are also to be fitted with sub
merged torpedo tubes. The new ar
mored cruisers are of 700 tons less dis
placement than the Tennessee and
Washington, planned in 1902, but their
estimated cost of $6,455,038 exceeds the
average cost of the California class of
$5,553,757, and that of the Tennessee
and Washington class of $6,090,038.
The Duke of Edinburgh class, of six
armored cruisers for the British navy
of 13,500 tons and 22.33 knots calculated
speed, are estimated to cost about $5,
650,000.
The three scout cruisers are to be
improvements on the Novik and Boy
arin, built for the Russian navy in 1900,
and likely to be far superior to the Sen
tinel class of eight vessels in the Brit
ish navy not yet completed. The
Novik and Boyarin are of. 3080 and 3200
tons respectively and have a trial speed
of 25 knots; their armament Is six
4.7-inch and eleven smaller guns, and
the normal coal carried is 600 tons. The
vessels proved so satisfactory that two
more, the Izumrud and Jerngotchug of
30S0 tons have since been added to this
class. In 1903 Great Britain followed
the lead of . Russia and ordered four
scouts ranging from 2S00 to 2900 tons
to have a speed of 25 knots, with arma
ments consisting of ten 12-pounders
and eight smaller. The limited dis
placement reduced the coal carried to
150 tons on normal draught and the
bunker capacity to 380 tons. This
inadequate supply makes it a foregone
conclusion that the vessels will be un
suited for the service as scouts, as
they will beÂ» unable to get far away
from the coal bunkers ashore. Not
withstanding this serious defect four
additional scouts of less displacement
have been ordered.
AMERICAN SCOUTS.
Prior to the outbreak of the war
Russia sent several hundred shipyard
mechanics to Port Arthur and since
hostilities began 2000 have been for
warded from Baltic shipyards and 1500
from naval stations on the Black 'Sea.
Building I and repairing operations at
the latter dockyards have been almost
suspended and hard times prevail In
the localities which largely depended
on work in the dockyards.
VTen vessels were authorized to be
built by act of Congress, approved
April 27 last. This number includes one
battleship, two armored cruisers, three
scouts, two colliers and two sea-going
tugs, at a total estimated cost of $27,
5S0.933. None of the plans have yet
been completed and it will be at least
six months before contracts can be
awarded and actual work begun, but
the war vessels have already received
their names. The battleship will be,
known as the New. Hampshire; the
armored cruisers as North Carolina
and Montana; the scouts as Chester,
Birmingham and Salem, and the col
liers as Erie and Ontario.
The proposed battleship New Hamp
shire will be of the same size and gen
eral-dimensions as the Connecticut
class, of which five are building, name
ly: 16,000 tons, 450 feet length, 70 feet
10 inches beam, and 24 feet 6 inches
mean draught. The engines are to be
of j 16,500 horsepower, giving a speed of
18 knots: normal \ coal capacity, 900
tons; full capacity, 2200 tons, _with
which the ship will draw . 26 feet 9
inches. The main battery is composed
of four 12-inch, eight 8-inch and twelve
7-inch; the secondary Dattery, subject
to slight alterations, of twenty 14
pounders, twelve 3-pounders, six 1
pounders and also two submerged tor
pedo tubes. The complete cost is esti
mated at 57,720,857 against an average
of $7,532,056 for the Connecticut class.
In the British navy the complete cost
of the King Edward VII class, of 16,350
tons and 18.5 knots speed, is 57,275,000.
NEW YANKEE CRUISERS. *
A Berlin company of capitalists have
hit upon a scheme for profiting by the
naval enthusiasm now animating Ger
many. They have rented aÂ£out two
acres of ground on the outskirts of the
city, which has been turned into an
artificial la,ke. Ther* thirty-one minia
ture warships will go through evolu
tions. Large covered .tribunes, capable
of accommodating 4000 spectators, have
been' erected, from which the Berlinera
and visitors to the capital may learn
naval tactics. The exhibition was to
"be opened at the end of June.
The German battleship Lothrlngen,
13,000 tons and IS knots speed, was
launched May 23 at Danzig. She was
begun .March 31, 1903, and is about- one
half completed. Five battleships of
this type are in various stages of com
pletion and two more are to be laid
down, during the present year. They
carry batteries of four 11-inch guns,
fourteen 6.7-lnch, twelve 14 pounders
and twelve 1 pounders, in addition to
which are five submerged /and one
above-water torpedo tubes. The esti
mated cost of the Lothringen Is 0,
760,000.'
The damage caused to the Russian
battleship Orel, which ran aground on
her way from St. Petersburg to Kron
stadt, is so serious as to make it doubt
ful if she is worth the time and money
required for reconstruction. When the
Â¦ f vessel struck bottom she was trimmed
heavily by the stern and the water fall
ing rapidly the ship settled 20 inches
] aft and only 3 Inches forward. Af
ter several days hard work, tugs suc
ceeded in pulling th'e^Orel off and it
was then found that her back had been
strained. The ship was all complete
except her ordnance outfit and the bro
ken back will require the removal of
all the machinery, shafting,' boilers and
steam pipes, in addition to which the
entire middle portion of the hull may
have to be renewed .in order to come
back to the original shape. The Orel
is of 13,600 tons displacement, launched
at St. Petersburg in 1902, and her cost
was about $5,125,000.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
FORECAST.
. Fair weather prevails orer the Interior of
the Paciflo Slope and cloudy weather along
the coast from San Francisco northward and
over the Rocky Mountain region. Light show
ers have occurred in the eastern" portions of
Washington and Oregon, thunderstorms
are reported at Walla Walla and Pocatello.
The pressure has risen along the coast and
fallen over the interior.
The temperature has risen orer Northern
Washington and fallen rear Sacramento: in
othÂ«Â»r districts the changes have been alight.
Forecast made at San Francisco for thirty
hours, ending midnight, July 4:
Northern California â Monday fair In the in
terior, cloudy along the coast, probably with
sprinkles in the morning: fresh westerly wind.
Southern Californiaâ Fair Monday; light

One Hundred and Forty-Two
Vessels, Many of Them Now
Due, Bound for This Port
speed, have yet been given out by the
Navy Department, but It Is to be as
sumed that the speed will be 25 knots
as in the Sentinel. The latter vessel
is of 17,000 horsepower and the contract
price of machinery is $784,060, being
$46 12 per horsepower. It will require
at least 20,000 horsepower to drive the
American scout of 3750 tons at a speed
of 25 knots, and the cost of machinery
at an advance of fifteen per cent over
the British cost, or say 553 per horse
power, would be $1,060,000, leaving
$765,000 for hull and equipment- This
latter sum wou}d be at the rate of $204
per ton displacement, against $199 30
per ton cost of hull and incidental
charges. The conclusions to be drawn
from the foregoing comparisons of cost
are that the Navy Department is able
to procure vessels at an Increased cost
of less than twelve and a half per cent
on similar British ships, which Is
greatly at variance with the state
ments of Messrs. Olcutt and Bowles,
who recently asserted that American
ships cost from forty to eighty per cent
more than those built In England.
A Persistent Patriot.
The peace of the Sabbath was on the water
front yesterday. Not a ship â not even a clum
sy sailing scow â bumped into another vessel or
a wharf, and not a deep sea drinking: mariner
tumbled overboard to be fished from the bay,
water and beer logged. But on* person tried
to break the quiet of the day and he only suc
ceeded in part. His name is John Adams and
he told the police ofScer who wrote this his
toric cognomen on the archives of the police
station that he was of the race of American
Presidents and was endowed with the inalien
able right to celebrate the Fourth of July as
he pleased.
Adams first wandered Into the Mariners'
Church, where the morning services were being
held. His demeanor while there was too up
roarious for even tha lone suffering worship
ers and be waa gently lad out Into the street.
He next turned up in a water front saloon,
where patienea with noisy, intoxicated people
13 not a striking virtue. "WTjen he hurriedly
quitted this place he had a bleeding nose and
a mild scalp wound. He was wise enough to
find the Emergency Hospital, where his
troubles were attended to. He went out in
the street with the expressed and laudable de
termination to bring bis celebration to a close
and so home. Instead he prolonged his pa
triotic festivities till a policeman ended them
and entered the name of Presidents at the
Harbor police station. He was the only
drunken roan on the water front and was a
monopolist in his special line of patriotic ob
servance. He will remain with his police
guardians till Tuesday morning.
However, Eastern Democrats can
only act as though Mr. Bryan werÂ« not
on earth until the morning of the con
vention. Then If they will look over
the St. Louis papers they will make a
great discovery.

xÂ»f the box in the first inning. Fitzger
ald lasted but three rounds. Outfielder
Lynch pitched out the same, allowing
but one hit In five innings. The TigÂ«rs

The Tac-oma players could not hit New

port. Several errors <jf judgment on the
part of the Tigers aided the Loo Loos
to get runs. The prettiest play of the
day was a double in the first Inning

In the flnals they beat Charles Kuehn
and A. Nourse easily. The best match
was that between Brabant and .Lines
and Harry Rolfe and Charles Foley.
The former won three sets out of four.
The match was exciting from start to
finish. The winners played a more ag-
The match between Smith and Mac-
Gavin should be one of the best played
here. MacGavin is right on edge, and
never played a better game than he
put up last Saturday. Smith has not
played In a tournament since last Oc
tober and his condition has not been
good, but he has lost none of his skill.
He has been playing an excellent game
In practice and will fight hard to re
'taln the championship. MacGavin has
never beaten Smith in a tournament,
while the latter has several victories
to his credit. The last match they
played, almost two years ago, was by
far the closest. Smith won the decid
ing set by a score of 14-12. This set
was probably the most exciting ever
played on the California Club courts.
Each player was within a point of the
match more than six times before
Smith, won out. The match to-day will
be three sets out of five.
The challenge matches for the tennis
State championship will be played to
day j on the Hotel Rafael courts. At
10:30 o'clock Miss Miriam Edwards,
holder, will meet Miss Hazel Hotch
klss, challenger. The match will be
two sets out of three. At 2:30 o'clock
in the afternoon Grant M. Smith,
holder, will meet J. Drummond Mac-
Gavin, challenger.
Miss Edwards and Miss Hotchklss
are both from Berkeley and are evenly
matched. Miss Hotchkiss has beaten
the champion in practice several
times lately. Miss Edwards, however;
is the better tournament player. A
close and an exciting match will surely
result when these two fair experts
meet.
A strong breeze blew in the channel
yesterday, where the racing sloops
Challenger and Corinthian were out
for practice. Commodore Jennings'
sloop Speedwell also cruised in the
channel. In the afternoon a heavy
Tog made the sailing damp and un
pleasant. The sloops Presto, Genesta,
Nixie. Merope and athers lay at anchor
In Tiburon Cove. The sloops Sans
Souoi. Meteor, Elsie, Siren, Peerless,
Iiazel S and Star dropped anchor In
Paradise Cove. The sloop Emilie cruis
ed up as far as McNears, where F.
A. Hyde's launch Olive lay at anchor.
On the return trip the wind was light
until the Point was passed and the
flood tide .made progress slow. After
working past the Point the breeze was
strong and continued so through the
straits. When Tiburon Cove was reach
ed the breeze became puffy and vari
able, making it a hard Job to pick up
moorings.
Douglas White's schooner Ramona,
the yawl Seven Bells and the sloop
Nixie were among the boats lying at
moorings In Tiburon Cove yesterday.
To-day the yachts will return to their
club anchorages. The proposed cruise
of the California Yacht Club to San
Mateo Point during the holidays was
called off, not enough owners wishing
to make the trip.
Most of the yachts of the San Fran
cisco, Corinthian and California fleets
are scattered at various points in the
upper bay. The San Francisco Club
has a cruise to Napa City on Its pro
gramme, but. as Commodore Morrow
wishes lo give his crew as much prac
tice as possible before the great race
for the Perpetual. Cup next Saturday,
be decided to give up the event.
The Corinthians cruised up to Army
Point on Saturday night and yesterday
sailed through Mo-ntezuma Slough and
thence to Vullojo. where anchor was
dropped. To-duy the fleet will sail
down from Vullejo to Tiburon Cove,
the boats receiving handicaps accord-
Ing to their supposed speed. J. K.
Bulger of the regatta committee will
start the yachts and T. J. Kavanagh
will take the times at the finish.

"Beware That Ye Forget Not" was'
the subject of the sermon deiivered by
thj? Rev. David J. . Evans, rector of
Grace Church, California and Stockton
streets, last night! The Rev. Mr. Evans
said In part: ' .
In $he year 1834 Herbert Spencer wrote to a
correspondent in America, who had asked for
h'.s opinion on the social outlook of the world:
"We have had bad times before us In Eng
land, but you have etlll more dreadful times
befCre you In America â civil war. Immense
bloodshed and eventually military despotism of
the severest type." . . 4 â¢ . _
Ten years have passed since that letter with
its ill-omened note of social revolution was
written. Ten years ago^thls western ' republic
had with ihe politics 'of 'the* world* at large no
very ck.se connection. Then, as ' In the
twinkltnz of an eye, something- happened and
everything was changed.- : As a. direct conse
quence ot that diabolical treachery, the blow-
Ins us of tlie Maine, the United - States of
Air.erlca movtd out Jrcm her seclusion on to
the theater ot the world at large: Such has
Ueen the change in the- ten years . '
But let us consider here In. this house of
God whether grave reasons do -not exist to ex
cite the alarm of evtry true patriot for the
luture of o^r beloved country.
Social and political conditions confront us
that are fraught, xrlth jjerll to the community
and make it .entirely possible that the dark
words of .the philosopher may come true.
Evils exist In our rnldrt and cancers are
eating Into our Eyst?m which, unlees arresud.
must bring to pass the sanguinary day wtich
Â«r. Spencer seemed -to foresee. /J.
. The reverend speaker quoted the
opinions of Felix Adler, E. L. Godkin,
Henry Watterson, Professor James of
Harvard and others concerning social
and political conditions in the United
States, and continued by saying:
If the minority, then, who have sounded a
solemn note of warning are in the right, then
anything is liable to happen.
More than a century has .passed since our
beloved republic was born amid turmoil of
war and nourished - by the blood of patriots
and ehe lives to-day the highest type of na
tional life: But In her progress toward an
ideal social state she has come to the parting
of the ways. Â¦ " . .-â¢â¢ . . â¢-,:â¢...

The strike of the Southern Pacific
freight handler?, which was declared
on the night of June 4, is off, and many
of the men will return to work Tues
day at the old scale.
For more than a month the union
men have stood out for their demand
for an increase in wages from 22^4 cents
per hour to 25 cents, and In the end
have failed to get it. The company has
consented to several conferences, but
has stood firm on the refusal to grant
the union's demands. There was ample
warning that the men intended to quit
on June 4 unless their demands were
conceded, and the company was pre
pared when the walkout occurred. Four
hundred non-union men were imported
and housed and fed in the Townsend
-street sheds. Special officers were
sworn in to guard the company's prop
erty and extra policemen were detailed
to the district. During the strike many
reports of. assaulting non-union men
' were made. In three instances men
were sent to the hospital for treatment.
The officers of the union denied any
connection with the assaults.
The freight was handled by the non
union men sufficiently fast to keep the
sheds clear, but the company would
have preferred to have the old hands
at work, and signified a willingmess to
take them back at the old scale. It
was thought the teamsters would back
the freight handlers up, but that could
not be done. The men became discour
aged, and after a conference with the
officials of the company the executive
committee of the union, through Na
than Winsky, the president, the strike
has been declared off. All members of
the union have been 'notified to meet
at union headquarters at 6:30 o'clock
Tuesday morning to report on for work.*

The residents of the district border
ing on Sutro Forest have been com
piaining for the past few months of the
ravages committed by a pack of wild
dogs.
Poultry, cats and even pigs have
been torn and devoured by these half
wolves. The pack lurks by day In the
brush of the r Sutro tract and by nighc
harries the neighborhood within some
blocks 6? the vicinity. '^ " V â¢ .
They have, extended their haunts into
Golden" Gate Park, as a marked de
crease in the peacock population
proves. Often of late the park police
and the gardeners have found crushed
bones and scattered feathers of* the
gaudy birds. - : . *
There have always been wild dogs in
Sutro Forest, but. they confined* their
wanderings to their chosen, home until
recently. Now their depredations anÂ»
causing alarm. The Tivoli Cafe's poul
try yard, located west of tfie tract, is
a large sufferer from these nightly
visits. The owners' of the preaerv
have put a watchman ' on ' the place,
whose duty will be to shoot the canine
robbers if he sees them. The watch
man, Herman Swanson, has jeen the
pack on, several occasions. He ways
there are. about forty dogs in it, for the
niost pJH , mongrels. The fiercest and
boldest among them is a huge grey
hound, who appears to be leader of the
pack. Thereby hangs a true, story that
is stranger than the best dog fiction
ever/ written.
Up to a few months ago' the hound
Connemara was the fleetest at Ingle
side Coursing Park. One afternoon,
after winning the final round of a
stake, Connemara suddenly darted
like a streak of light for the gate of
the v park. Â¦
Out he sped, and with the'machine
like lope of the greyhound made his
way into the hills. That was the last
ever seen of Connemara at the cours
ing parks.
As the dog was valued at several
thousand dollars an extended search
was made, but to no avail. It was sup
posed that the animal started to chase
over the unfenced hills and ran till he
dropped dead.
But Swanson's description of the
leader of the Sutro forest pack tallies
with that of Connemara. It is therefore
supposed that the blooded hound, in
fierce rebellion against man. fled to the
wilds. -.
The coursing parks were too limited
for Connemara, whose instincts told
him that the whole world was his to
run over. Obeying that instinct, he fled
into the. hills. Hidden in the brush he
round the pack. No doubt at first they
resented his intrusion, and Connemara
had to overthrow- their mongrel leader.
Perhaps he fought; the entire pack, bit
ing, snarling and rolling through the
brush. At any rate he gained their re
spect and fear.' His breeding told. Now
he rules over them. In the night his
bay leads the chorus that rings through
the ravines of Sutro Forest; at his heels
the yelping L mongrels follow Jn search
of prey. He gets the ? choicest morsels
from : the chicKen ; coops and the fattest
peacocks in the park. . â¢ - â¢-;Â¦â¢â¢Â¦
. - If allowed . to remain at large he will
no doubt sire a race of wild . dogs that
ciety Proves to Be a Great
Success.
Annual Outing of the Mutual Aid So-
The annual picnic of the Printers'
Mutual Aid Society at Schuet
zen Park, San Jose, yesterday,
was </he of # the most suc
cessful In the history of the organiza
tion and in point of good fellowship
and an' all-around good time it proved
a record breaker. The trains bore fully
two .thousand craftsmen with their
friends, the photo engravers traveling
in a^ special car.
The picnickers from this city were
joined at 'the park by reinforcements
from San Jose, Redwood City and
other nearby points. The committee
in charge did *its utmost to make all
feel at home and the efforts,", of its
members were crowned with success.
The day was spent in dancing and
athletic sports. New ties were formed
and old ones more firmly cemented.
The, returning trains brought home' a
crowd of tired but happy people, who
expressed themselves as having spent
one of the most enjoyable days of their
lives. Â¦ -

SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE WHO
WILL DELIVER THE FOURTH
OF JULY ORATION.
Unhappy is the lot of the little-footed
women of China. On board the Korea
one of them, waits to join a husband
whom she has seen but once, and
only for as long as It takes a Justice
of the Peace to pronounce the couple
husband and wife. She is -also the
widow of a man she never has seen.
Surely all the josses of ill luck have
conspired against young Mrs.- Chin
King Lung Chieu Yan '(nee Wai Ho),
who is now 18 years old, little-footed
and marvelously ' beautiful from.' the
Oriental viewpoint. ' . Â¦â¢'â¢ .
-Two years, ago. Wai Ho. that. was
sobbed a good-by to the little goldfish
in her father's little fishpond back in
China and looked for the- last, time at
the tea gardens on the terraced hills.
She, was to be married, they told her,
to an honorable and 'handsome youna
man who dwelt far across the weary
waste of waters. â¢ â¢
She did not want to be married. She
wanted to stay in the gardens and play
with the goldfish. But her father told
her she must go.
In the company of a venerable and
honorable woman she sat forth. The
land trip was long. It was such a big
world, and she felt so lonely. Then! they
boarded a steel monster that swam
upon the Â¦ water like the ducks her
father owned. .
A NOISY MONSTER.
The monster shrieked as it moved,
and she was very much . frightened.
There was an awful extent of blue
water to cross, ' and her ' intellectual
powers being limited she fell to won
dering how many millions of times more
water therewtt'as in the world than in
her father's^iuck pond. "*
They came to land at last through the
Golden Gate, and- little Miss Wai Ho
was nlaced in the detention sheds.
There they told her that her pros
pective bridegroom, Chieu Yan, was
dead. By Chinese law she had already
been married to him. though she had
never seen him. Therefore she was a
widow and they told her to weep.
She wept copiously, because she was
very lonely â¢ and felt that she would
never see the goldfish again.
For a while she *vas. kept in the de
tention sheds pending the granting of
permission to land bythe Immigration
Commissioners at Washington. . After
ward she was landed provisionally, and
stayed at the Presbyterian- Mission- .:
Mrs. Chlen, the widowed mother of
her husband that- would have been,

law. . â¢ .-Â¦ .-;â¢ ' Â¦Â¦Â¦,' .:' â¢ Â¦. > '
RICH WOOER APPEARS.
. Chin King Sung, a prosperous young
Chinese. .merchant, hearing that there
was a beauteous, sixteen-year-old,wid
ow with'* little' feet on the matrimonial
market, sought Mrs. Chien and , sued for
the hand of her daughter-in-law, so
regarded from the ; Oriental . point of
view. '_....... .'Â¦''"...;.'Â¦' â¢"
Chin King Sung had money; in sev

Mrs. Chien told" him to consider him

was not asked. It .'Â«âÂ«Â« none of her
business whom she married. â¢ < i\ :
So Wai: Ho and Chin King Sung
were taken before Judge Daniels at the
City Hall and married; "alle, same

WUen H. H. North of the Immigra
tion Bureau heard of the marriage he
ordered the bride instantly sent back

legally landed and had no right to
marry here. - V "'
So Mrs. Chin King Sung Chieu' Tan
was Â¦ returned ' to her Â¦ fatherland. -. She
came back and now waits 1 official per
mission to join a husband for whom
she does not care a' copper cash.
And she sobs frequently and her;al
mond ;eyes are sad â¢ because : she will

China, .'â¢ 'Â¦Â¦'}'Â¦-.'Â¦Â¦Â¦' Â¦ '.Â¦ '-*'Â¦:<
reau. "She is a Chinese girl, . therefore
not entitled to land on American* soil.
Again, she is classed as a student and
claims that her father is a Portuguese
subject, therefore she is entitled to
land.
The, Immigration Commission is off
for the holidays and the Portuguese
Consul is out of town. So Miss Sung
must wait on board the Korea.
The young lady, who is educated and
rather un-Oriental in appearance, is
en route to Macon, Ga., where she
will study for a teacher at the uni
versity there. She was a schoolmate in
Shanghai of Miss Seili Kinj?, who is
now a student of the California State
University. She is chaperoned by Miss
Sanius, 1 a missionary. < ,\ â¢
Miss Sung: complains of her. deten
tion, in very good English; and declares
that she will appear to the Portuguese
Consul as soon as possible."" â¢

As snappy as the firecrackers that
sputtered outside during its playing is
Miss Valerie Bergere's new sketch at
the Orpheum this week, "Jimmie's Ex
periment." It is pleasant again to. see
this competent young woman in a part
suited to her capacities.
As thoroughly as she missed the spir
it of the shy little Japanese she es
sayed last week, so entirely is she the
brusque, boyish, . tender-hearted young
athlete of this week's sketch. The part
might have been written to fit â prob
ably was. It's clever author,, and the
play's, is ' Roy Fairchild. The plot is
not newâ the lover turned burglar to
frighten the lady, who thereupon be
trays the desired feminine dependence.
But the kind of lady is new, and very
charming Miss Bergere makes her.
From her openiiig scene in gymnasium
suit â there's a pretty bit of fencing
here â to where the womanly hoyden
sits dreaming over the fire of the child
that may lie in her arms some day, the
actress is vividly convincing. Her
pathos in particular rings true. Miss
Bergere is effectively assisted by Henry
Keane, Maude Turner Gordon and
Marie Burke. . :'Â¦'â¢
A pretty and novel act is that of
Green and Werner, who, after appear
ing in the usual song and dance, do a
taking jungle song, picturesquely set.
Inez de Wolf is another newcomer, and
though evidently nervous at first
showed a sweet and powerful soprano
in her ballads. Gillihan and Murray
are saddest when they do not sing.
Singing their catchy coon songs, in ex
cellent voices, they are a distinctly
amusing couple. The one that does the
cake-walking lady entertains particu
larly. Others on the bill are the Zeb
and Zarrow trio in their miracle bicy
cle play; John F. Clark, who mono
logues again as last week; the Leigh
brothers, acrobats, and .Gallagher and
Barrettl You. will make a mistake in
missing the blograph' this week, with
its Venice in a gondola, Rome and .the
Vesuvian crater In action.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
â¢ Â» â¢
James Neill, supported by most of
his old company, found a warm re
ception at the Grand Opera-house yes
terday. The favorite actor presented
"Barbara Frietchie" as the opening
piece of his engagement and Fitch's
play was never "better , enjoyed by. a
local audience. Of Neill as Captain
Trumbull and Miss Edythe Chapman
in the title role little need be told to
San Francisco playgoers. The appear
ance of each was a signal for applause
and there were many curtain calls.
They are sure to receive a happy re
sponse from the public during their
stay.
r ;The support, is harmonious and ex
cellent. Lillian Andrews is a typical
"mammy" and George Bloomquest as
Jack Nesrley does some strong acting.
The character of Arthur Frietchie,
brother of Barbara, is ably sustained
by Donald Bowles and John W. Bur
ton takes the- part of Colonel Negley,
a thorough Southern gentleman.
Reginald Travers in the role of Mr.
Frietchie lends great strength to the
cast. His work in every act is of a
high order. Frances Slosson- as Sue
Royce, Katherine Gllman as Sally
Negley, and Fave; Wallace as Laura
Royce furnish characters for a pretty
scene in the first act and Alice Entz
man appears as a profound Southern
matron. Sheldon Lewis, . one of the
most popular men in the company, acts
Fred Gelwex and is very good. W. H.
Harkness, J. D. Harrington, Scott Sea
ton, George B. Berrell and Philip Lord
complete the cast. The company will
give a matinee this afternoon.
