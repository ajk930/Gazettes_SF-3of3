WASHINGTON, April 22.â The Unit

One thing is quite certainâ that no ves

allowed to pass directly into the posses

is said 1 to ; be ' true of .*. merchant ships

Washington Authorities Disagree Over
Russian Decree Forbidding Its Use.
WASHINGTON, April 22.â There are
signs of a difference of opinion between
the civil and military branches of the
Government respecting the Russian de
cree against the 'use of wireless teleg
raphy by newspaper correspondents.
The disposition of the service branches
is distinctly in favor- of Government
control, which makes v toward the sup
port of the Russian position. It is even
argued that no civilian should be al
lowed to erect a wireless mast wlthcrut
executive permission, because its use
might interfere with that of some mili
tary mast. \ While the State Depart
ment-opinion is not crystallized, it Is
known that the department, is diposed
to move cautiously in laying any
sweeping prohibitions on private enter
prise, either newspaper or commercial.

ing up the road. Conn did not return
that day to the store nor. next day, and
Payne notified the - missing man's
brothers at Silver Lake and at Lake
view. Parties were sent out to scour
the country in every direction.
Almost every citizen of t Silver Lake
engaged in the hunt for the missing
man. The river near that place was

NACO, Ariz., April 22.â Billy Stiles
and Bravo Juan have joined forces.
The two outlaws met somewhere In the
San Jo?e Mountains of Sonora and
from there rode into Naco last night,
where they raided the supply store of
the Southwestern Commercial and Im
porting Company on the. Mexican side
of the line. The bandits secured $1200
in money from the. cash register and
other valuables and' succeeded in mak
ing .way .with the booty before they
were discovered by the officers.
[Â¦ The' stores entered are located near
the' line and in the center of the Mexi
can town, and such a thing as a rob
bery there' was never feared. Stiles is
familiar with Naco and aware of this
fact. He' knew that only a- bold at
tempt such, as this. could ever succeed.
Accordingly the outlaws rode- right
into town, tied their horses and effect
ed, an -entrance Into the stores Â¦* by a
back door.-'. They -were discovered just
as. they were making for their horses
by. two Mexicans, who gave the alarm.
.- Rangers Stamford and Hopkins im
mediately responded and took the trail
of the outlaws, , which they were still
following when last heard from, while
a second party went out at sunrise. The
outlaws went southeast into the San
Jose Mountains.
: This was the first seen' of â¢ Bravo
Juan' In three years, although the
officers have ' f or ; a - long time believed
that he -was in the country, having re
turned from theJ interior of Mexico.
Stiles and ; Juan are old partners and a
worse 1 pair than Stiles and Alvord.

twice, each time the cartridge failing to

As a matter of fact, however, when
the meeting takes place President Bo
will 'announce that the sale has been
completed, and instead of asking for
authority to execute a future contract
it will only remain to ratiry the con
tract of sale which the officers of the
company have already formally com
pleted. t)nly a few cf the highest offi
cers of the company are now aware of
the secret, which will not be known
except .by this announcement in the
United States, up to the time of the
meeting. It is confidently believed that
the completion of the sale before the
meeting will increase the vote for rati
fication, as it. frill be recognized that
nothing more remains but to acquiesce.

PARIS, April 22.â Fears are enter
tained in Government circles that an
attempt to take the life of President
Loubet may be made during his jour
ney to 'Italy. The police have received
secret instructions to provide a strong
guard for the train, and no loophole
through which an assassin might oper
ate will be left open.
Marseilles promises to resemble an
armed camp when the Presidential
train passes through. It is confidently
stated that not alsingle anarchist will
go free there. Every mile of track be
tween Paris and the Mediterranean will
be subjected to close scrutiny before
the train passes. ".
The Roman populace is reported to
be enthusiastic, but the Parisian pub
lic takes little more interest in , the
event than It does when "Pere Loubet"
goes off with his pipe and gun and dog
for a few days of pheasant shooting at
Compiegne. : : y\ . : - '. Â¦
"President Loubet's . visit to ,' Italy; is
at least as important \ as | any .^recent
interchange of visits between European
sovereigns," said an official. of the Pres
ident's " householtT to-day.*" "Thfe-'Presi
dent," he continued, "has 'taken' a pe
culiar interest . in the . recent rapproche^
ment of the Latin nations of- Europe.
It may be said that he 'personally pre
pared both a new, economic "entente be
tween France and Italy and ] also the
political friendship which followed it
bonds which it would have seemed im
possible to forge a* decade ago. The
result of Loubet's jvisit will be formally
to consecrate this understanding, which
is full of meaning. to the peace of Eu
rope.
' "President Loubet is heart and, hand
with King Edward, whose whole policy
since he came "to the throne has been
to weave such a complicated inner web
of international friendships that the
more formal political alliances will be
unable to disturb them unless on occa
sions of worldwide importance. The
President is one of the main support
ers of the new belief that; European
differences can be settled by common
sense rather than by threats. King
Edward," President Loubet and the
Czar have done more , in a few years
than professional peace advocates did
in two centuries." . â¢ . .

Governor Grosvenor said that no man
on the stump ever made a better im
pression on the country than did Mr.
Roosevelt in the campaign of 1900. His
dignified manner of presiding over the
Senate and his modesty with Senators
was commendable. Then came the cri
sis of hia life, the death of President
McKinley.
"And then it was," said Grosvenor,
"that the tears of the Democrats be
gan to flow." The statement of Roose
velt at the bier of McKinley that he
would carry, out the policies of Mc-
Kinley eaved untold â¢ money losses In
this country. I stand here to-day a
friend of McKinley. and I say that
there is not one of McKinley's friends
willlngHo say that he has not al
ways been treated [ with kindness and
consideration by Theodore Roosevelt.
Do you think you can read and garble
newspaper extracts and discredit Mc-
Kinley and Roosevelt? _Jf you think bo
you will find when the campaign is
over that you have been casting your
arrows up the tree where the bird was
cot roosting/ JfiB|
Replying, General Grosvenor said
that it was unimportant what he had
written four years ago. He (Grosv
enor) four years ago was an opponent
of the nomination of Roosevelt- And
at that time he wrote a popular opin
ion of Mr. "Roosevelt which was print
ed all over the country. In this he
made perfectly plain the sentiment at
that time. i
"And if the gentleman thinks he can
make me apologize for. that statement
he has got hold of the wrong man."
added Grosvenor. Mr. Roosevelt had
written of hire (Grosvenor) what he
had a right to say. Kitchen was only
thrashing over old straw.
"I never said he was distasteful to
me as a candidate," 'said Grosvenor.
"Mr. Roosevelt was put on the. ticket
with Mr. McKinley, but it was McKin
ley who got all the abuse."
GROSVENOR REPLIES
that any man who had such profound
contempt for the legislative branch of
the Government was unfit to be its
executive head and was a dangerous
person.
RENO, April 22.â Wadsworth, one of

Captain Murat has been a resident
of Pasadena for the last sixteen years.
Owing to religious, political and family
differences he left France forty years
ago, leaving his identity, title and
prospects of a brilliant military career
behind that he might strike out anew
In this country. He made his way. In
various cities of the country for many
years, under a different name. Some
time after coming to Pasadena his
Identity was revealed, and he resumed
the name of Murat, taking only the
title of captain, which was bestowed
on him for his daring courage in, the
Crimean war. Four years ago, June
23, he was quietly married to Miss Ju
liet Scheltima. a member of one of

ROSE PAYS*FOR CRIME.
CHICAGO, April 22.â Atheist to the
last, but seemingly unrrerrrd complete
ly, Peter Neldermeler, leader of the
car barn bandits, was hanged to-day
from a chair, contrasting with his com
panions in crime, Gust&v Marx and
Harvey Vandine, who, standing erect,
kissed an Image of Christ and died
without a tremor. The three execu
tions were separate, twenty minutes
apart, the same scaffold being used for
all. Neldermeier had coasted contin
uously of his courage, but as the last
moments approached he collapsed and
was unable to take three consecutive
steps of a march. to the gallows. - Dr.
F. W. McNamara, jail physician, had
visited Neidermcler previously and said
that his physical condition was satis
factory. The bandit leader himself told
Chief Deputy Sheriff Peters, who ap
peared with the death warrant, that
the last walk would be without aid.
Deputy Peters. then read the document
and , Niedermeler started from his cell.
He had gone only two steps, when he
sank, and it was found necessary to
lift him to the scaffold. No preacher or
priest accompanied Neldermeler. he
having finally said, when offered a last
opportunity when leaving his cell, that
he would die as he had lived, an atheist.
On the scaffold Jailer Whitman dis
regarded the custom of asking whether
the condemned men wished to say any
thing. The hood was quickly adjusted.
The bandit, moving his head so that
the rope might more easily be ar
ranged, took a last glance at the spec
tators. He appeared as if in a stupor.
A moment later, at 10:25 o'clock, the
trap fell.
When the body of Neidermeier had
been removed Marx walked slowly to
the scaffold with several priests, after
having* confessed, repented and re
ceived the last sacraments, as did Van

the Roman Catholic faith.
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, April 22.â
Frank Rose, who murdered his wife
on last Christmas day, was .shot to
death in the yard of the Statu Peni
tentiary here at 10:19 this morning.
Rose was strapped in the same little
wooden chair in which Peter Morten
sen met his death a few months ago.
Five prison guards, concealed behind
a heavy blue curtain in the doorway
of the biacksmith shop across , the
area, formed the executing squad. One
of the rifles held a blank cartridge.
Rose went to his death with the same
coolness that has marked his conduct
since he surrendered to the police.
Death was Instantanous, the four bul
lets lodging in or very close to hi3
heart. ; :. '
Rose's crime was Decullarly atro
cious and cold-blooded in that it al
most resulted in the death of his two
year-old son from starvation and cold.
Rose, who claimed his wife was con- .
sorting with other men, shot her oxiM
Christmas day, while she was lying in
bed. He sat and talked with her until
she died from the wound and then
went away. leaving his boy in bed
with his dead mother and soaked in
her blood. Rose says he returned four
times in the next two days to feed
the child, climbing through a window
and over the dead body of his wife In
order to get into the house. At the
end of "that time he went to police
headquarters and gave himself up,
stating that he had shot his wife. He
never expressed regret for his deed
and asserted a firm befief that it was
all predestined.
Rose said that in 1892 he- was a
member of the Dalton gang in Okla
homa for a time and took part in the
robbery and murder of a number of
"boomers." After leaving the Daltons
he continued his operations as a mem
ber of the Starr gang. Rose said he
served two years in the State Prison
at Jefferson City, 'Mo., for larceny
and embezzlement.

to the gloom which has prevailed since
the disaster to the Petropavlovsk. "We

Fuid. that twenty-five years after
Appomattox Roosevelt had in one of
his publications declared that until the
word treason was stricken from the
dictionary, Jefferson Davis would be
an arch traitor. That, he said, was a
strike at the South and the Confeder
ate to'.dier. He also referred to another
'publication of Mr. Roosevelt's in which
he said that throughout Southern
character there ran a streak of coarse
.and brutal barbarism. He compared
"the kind, loving words of McKinley"
in an address to Confederate veterans,
to "the insulting words of Roosevelt."
He f^iid that in one of his books Presi
dent Roosevelt "deliberately teaches
ar.d advocates lynching for the stealing
of a ragtail Texas pony." He asked if
that book <lld not have something- to
dc with stimulating "the great people
of the North to lawlessness." The
t>eople of tht South, he said, condemned
lynching for all crimes, because the
hand cr civilization and Christianity
had been lifted against it. No man the
civilized world over. Â«he said, would
condone outrages against woman, "and
yet Â»o don't preach lynching or teach
it; but, knowing tho weakness of hu
man, nature, mobs cannot be controlled
in sparsely nettled communities where
w* cannot get sufficient police force on
the spot at once." He believed that
xvery decent Republican in the country
*ould pause in shame that the Presi
dent of the United States had scattered
books advocating lynch law.
Reading from a speech made by Mr.
Roosevelt while Governor of New
York, he declared Mr. Roosevelt had
characterized the Congress of the

Laughter on the Democratic side fol
lowed. "The humiliating spectacle,"
he continued, "is that since he has
beÂ«n President of the United States he
has treated this Republican House as
a herd of cattle and the most humil
iating thing about it is that the Re
publicans allowed the President to
treat them a* cattle and lay down be

during McKinley's last campaign Gen
eral GroEvenor, in signed articles, had
referred to the President, the Governor
of New York, as a "brilliant, erratic
and curious sort of man." Mr. Kitchen
charged that Mr. Roosevelt, as a can
didate for Vice President, was distaste
ful to Mr. McKinley and challenged
Grosvenor to deny it, as well as the
statement that Mr. Roosevelt as Vice
President was humiliated by the
friends of McKinley, including General
Grosvenor. "And yet," he said,' "you
men Fit here and gulp down everything
Roosevelt says, and not one of you
darts raise his hand in memory of Wil
liam McKinley." McKinley had a right
to think that Roosevelt would be dis
tasteful to him. "Contemplate," he
said, "the amazing spectacle of any
Republican in the United States being
humiliated by General Grosvenor and
contemplate this same man marshaling
under his banner the hosts of Republi

â¢ â¢ - â¢
Last night the clever manifestation
of mirth and music thrust upon us
under the name of "His Royal Nibs"
was heard - for the last time â for
a while.. But it is distinctly to be hoped
that bo. sparkling a bit of comedy' and
eong will not' be shelved' for very long, 1
The date of the wedding has not
been divulged, but it. Is surmised that
it cannot be far # avfayâ so importunate
has been the courtship.
Now that Mies Kirk has promised
her hand to a Californian, we shall
possess within our borders three of the
greatest' heiresses of Chicago â Mrs.
Jack Casserly, who was Miss Cecelia
Cudahy, and Mrs. Frank Carolan, '..who
was a Pullman, having already suc
cumbed to the allurements of Cali
fornia. It would be Interesting to hear
the opinion of the Chicago beaux. at
this 'latest defection from their coterie
of heiresses.
The predicted has happened, thereby
affirming the excellent judgment of
men of the Westâ Miss Cora Kirk, the
dashing Chlcagoan. has been wonâ and
been won by a Californian, Paul Clag
stone of the Southland. After the
"Royal Nibs" affair last night Miss
Kirk held a miniature salon ofÂ«con
gratulatory friends, the betrothal
possessing the fascinating prelude of a
fast and furious courtship.
Miss Kirk Is a girl of fine manner and
style, the possessor of rare Titian hair,
and wears her gowns with distinction.
Her father is famously rich, even for a
Chlcagoan, and has bestowed upon the
daughter all the mental emoluments
of the rich. She has long been the
close friend of Mrs. Francis Carolan,
abo of Chicago, and has been visiting
the latter at Burlingame.
It was while sojourning at Del Monte
that Miss Kirk met Mr. Clagstone, who
was a conspicuous figure in the polo
tournament, making a very clever
record with' his little mount.
Mr. Clagstone is best known In the
southern part of the State, where. he
and his mother, Mrs. Morrison, are
identified with the exclusive set at
Riverside.

Kroeck and a squad of the faculty were
busy directing affairs. Weeds were dug
from all the paths and the lawns and

SAN JOSE, April 22.â A young ladles'
seminary, modeled after Vassar, Mount
Holyoke and Gaihsvllle schools, may be
established In San Jose or this vicinity.
Three ladies experienced in this work
are now in San Jose looking over the
ground. They are Miss J. N. Sims, Miss
C. E. Squires and Miss E. Mann, and
are from New York and Boston. They
have sufficient financial backing to go
ahead with their plans as .soon as a site
is secured. San Mateo, Palo. Alto and
Centerville have been visited by the
ladles and they have now been in San
Jose for several days. A number of
Bites here have been inspected and the
promoters of the school ' have been
pleased with the location of : the city
and its advantages. They, have not yet
made a choice, but state -that some
point around the bay .>will be selected
and that there Is a good opening for
such a school \ here on this coast. In
case a site is selected expensive and at
tractive buildings will be erected and
fine grounds laid out.

R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of
trade will say to-morrow:
Unseasonable weather Is etill the
chief drawback to Improvement in
business, complaints being received
from every section of the country. Not
only is current distribution of mer
chandise particularly affected, but fu
ture commitments are undertaken
most conservatively on account of the
possible injury to crops. There is much
confidence regarding the future despite
the" fact that at many points supplies
of merchandise are burdensome. Struc
tural work is gradually resuming nor
ir.al proportions for the season. May 1
Is usually the date fixed for labor con
troversies, but this year there is little
prospect of serious disturbances. At
the West railroad freight tonnage has
not increased, but passenger traffic is
\ *Â»ry heavy, and earnings of all roadf
thus far reported in April are only 4.3
per cent smaller than last year.
While no further improvement can
be discerned in the iron and steel in
dustry, it is gratifying to find no dis
tinct evidence of a setback. Aside from
elremrth and activity in Texas hides
1he Western market for domestic skins ,
J? dull and barely steady.
Slightly lower prices prevail for the
JÂ«adin? agricultural staples.

to-morrow will say:
Unseasonably cold weather all over
the country Interferes with plant prep
aration and growth and Interrupts ac
.Xlvity In many lines, notably building.
Distributive trade, both wholesale and
retail, has practically "marked time"
during the week- Back of weather and
price conditions there looms up the po
litical outlook, which In most cases has
induoed a tendency toward conserva
tism. While fall trade has opened meas
urably well In some sections, there Is
a tendency to await developments
â¢ likely to affect crop and other condi
tions. Among the Industries Iron and
steel note .an accentuation of the quiet
observable last week. - The market for
raw wool Is rather low at the Bast,
though higher prices than last year are
reported. The poor trade In flour was a
depressing feature this week, the mills
refusing much business at the lower
rates. Some export business was re
ported done at the declines In wheat
and corn.

'If you had seen that poor man
raise up in his bed and object and his
weeping wife protest and break down,
you could not have done so, your
Honor," answered Brackett.
Mayor Schmitz asked a few more
questions relative to Dr. Brackett's
feelings toward the City and County
Hospital, and finally asked him if it
was not a fact that the witness had
said things detrimental to the repu
tation of the main hospital. Dr. Brack
ett could not recollect, and when pinned
down to the reported statement that
Goir.g back to the question of why
the patient was not taken to the City
anÂ«I County Hospital," the Mayor asked
the witness* several pointed questions
as .to^his knowledge and opinion of the
county institution. Dr. Brackett re
plied that he considered it a good place
and had never said anything against
any one being taken there. .
*"Do you not believe," asked Mayor
Schmitz. "if you, as^ a municipal of
ficer, had strongly recommended the
patient to go to th/ City and County
Hospital you would have been doing
your duty?"
Dr. Brackett stated he had told Mrs.
Ames, after the death of her husband,
that she did not owe anything for his
services, and In reply to a query by
the Mayor stated he had never asked
her if she had any furniture to give
him in payment for his services. In
fact he had told her from the beginning
he would charge her nothing, and upon
several occasions had given her car
fare to go to Fleishhacker and try to
get some settlement with him.
Witness reiterated his statement
that he had not asked Fleishhacker for
any money, but had asked him to pay
the expenses of the patient in the hos
pital.
Schmitz â Why didn't you recommend that
he be taken to the City and County Hospital?
Brackett â Because the patient and his wife
both objected.
Schmitz â Did you say anything against the
City and County Hospital to prejudice their
minds? Brackett â 1 did not.
"Do you think you did right in de
manding and accepting that fee?"
askÂ»d Mayor Schmitz.
"He was a disinterested party. I
cannot see how I can be expected to
visit families and patients outside of
my duties," replied Brackett.
Sctmitz â Why didn't you ask him to call at
the hospital? Brackettâ I never did so.
MAYOR SCnMTTZ INQUIRES.
Mrs. Ames asked me to see Flelshhacker
ard find oat what he would do for her. as shÂ«
was very poor. I called on Flelshhacker and
charred him (5 for the visit. It was strictly
out of the line of my duty, and while there
I ejwke to him about the people belr.fr poor
and said the wife wanted the maa taken to a
private hospital, but did not have any money.
Flelshhacker asked me If $50 would eee the
tnan through aad I told him It would not.
Flelshhacker said he didn't think he could
stand any more than that. As far as my
asking him for any compensation for myself Is
concerned It la absolutely false.
I told MrÂ«. Ames I would treat thÂ« case tor
nothlac if her husband was taken, to a hos
pital where arrangements could be made for
his expenses. She wanted him to be taken to
the French Hospital, but 1 told her 1 could
see him more frequently If he was placed In
the German Hospital. 1 as that was nearer my
home. She assented to that and the patient
was taken to the German Hospital. While I
was at Fleishhacker 1 b I received the $5 from,
him for the call I made, but no other money,
nor did I ask for any. â
If this la the last word I am erer to say.
I will say I sever asked for one cent nor
asked for any fee for serrtoea la the hospital.
Dr. Huntlnrton came to the hospital and we
talked the case over and be made an exami
nation. I told him I believed amputation was
thÂ« only course to pursue and be agreed with
me, but suggested that the patient be taken
out to the City and County Hospital, but both
Mr. Araes and his wife objected to that.
The time of this conversation was
given as 12:30 or 1 o'clock In the morn-
Ing following the accident. Brackett
claimed that at that time Fleishhacker
told him he would see Dr. Huntington
In the morning and arrange for a con
sultation. .
Lifting up Ms hand, the accused
physician said:
and requested Brackett to come to
Flelshhacker's place of business. Such
a step as that, Brackett Informed, him.
would require the payment of a fee
or $5.
QUESTION OF TIME.
Climatic and. Other Condi
tions Cause Interruption
of Activity in All Lines
Thr> Mayor â Did you tell Dr. Brackett about
Dr. Huntington wanting the patient sent to
the City and County Hospital?
Fleishhackerâ I did. Dr. Brackett said no
phveician could get a patient into his ward.
He would have to take any physician sent
him.
The Mayor â What's that? Do you mean to
say Dr. Brackett made that statement? Why.
sir. It Is absolutely untrue. Any patient in
the, City and County Hospital can have any
physician he may want.
Fleishhackerâ Dr. Brackett Is right here and
he cannot deny saying so.
The Mayor â How about that $100 fee?
Fleishhacker â Dr. Brackett did not ask for a
fee of $100 for getting a release from our firm,
but he did talk about putting the ccse in the
Uerman Hospital, and gave me to understand
MAYOR SCI1MITZ ANGRY.
Fleishhacker â Dr. Huntlngton wanted Amps
sent to the City and County Hospital, aa he
had a ward there where the man could be
placed, for he (Huatington) believed Ames* had
a chance of saving his limb, but Dr. Brackett
was of th<* opinion that the patient could not
recover. There was a consultation with Mrs.
Ames, who decided to give the case to Dr.
Brackett.
Attorney Samuels questioned Fleish
hacker regarding a judgment which
had been rendered against his firm on
April 20 in favor of Mrs. Ames as the
guardian of her minor son, and in
reply the witness said he understood
the insurance company wanted to set
tle! So far as their firm was con
cerned, the insurance company was re
sponsible for any damage to any of
their employes. He also stated he
knew from what Mrs. Ames had said
and from what the physicians had told
him that She was In financial straits.
From time to time he had given her
money to the aggregate of $55. Mayor
Schmitz considered that matter as im
material in the question at issue and
ordered the testimony to proceed.
Later in the investigation the testi
mony regarding the money cut quite
an important figure. It was as fol
lows: i -
Fleishhacker â That is absolutely wrong. I am
positive it was about noon on Sunday. I did
not call him the night before, for I did not
know of the accident until Sunday. I called
Dr. Huntington after talking over the tele
phone to Dr. Brackett, and he went down to
the hospital.
At that point of the proceedings
Mayor Schmitz explained Dr. Brack
etfs testimony regarding the mid
night call on the telephone.
Mayor Schmitz â Did you ask Dr. Brackett
to call on you? Flelshhackerâ Positively not.
I was surprised to see him come to my office.
Durlns our conversation then he stated It
would be necessary to pay a fee of $5 for Dr.
Huntington consulting with him at the Emer
gency Hospital. .
Dr. Brackett called me up at my houeo
Sunday afternoon and Informed me that
he believed It would be neceasary to
amputate the man's limb. * He aeked
me to call and see him. for he believed be
could get a release for us from damages. I
was surprised at that statement, for from
what tie eaid the roan at that time was ready
to undergo an operation. I thought tben It
would be well to have some other surgeon talcs
the case. I asked Dr. Brackett (all of this
was over the telephone) If I could send Dr.
Hunttcgton to look Into the case. He replied
that 1 could, but' that I would have to pay a
fee of to. I Eaid all right and that Dr.
lluntlnsrtim would be In the hospital at 2
o'clock. Dr. Huntington kept the appointment.
STATEMENT DENIED. \
Mortimer Fleishhacker, the man for
whom Ames worked - and who, the
Coroner's jury discovered, had paid Dr.
Brackett a fee, was sworn and stated
be had not brought any charges against
Dr. Brackett and had no personal feel
ing In the case under consideration.
The first he knew of any publicity re
sulting from his meeting Dr. Brackett
was when he was summoned to appear
at the Inquest. Witness was positive
In his statement that he had not called
Dr. Brackett on the phone the night
of the accident, for he knew nothing
of the accident until noon the next day.
Continuing, he said:
he had told Mrs. Ames It was the worst
place any one could be sent ha dodged
behind the- protective expression. "I
don't remember."
,As a parting "question. Mayor Schmltz
asked whether the reported statement
of Fleishhacker was true that he
(Brackett) refused to consult with Dr.
Huntington unless he was paid a fee,
Brackett replied emphatically In the
negative, and then asked to be excused,
as he had to go on duty. His request
was granted.
FLEISHJIACKEU CALLED.
Mayor Schmitz stated he would care
fully go over the testimony and give
his decision to-day. ,
Mayor Schmltz excused the witness
and, before adjourning the investiga
tion until afternoon, stated that the
postponement of the inquest In Ames'
death for two months would be pVe
sented to the Grand Jury for investi
gation, and if Judgment had^been se
cured in her name' without her con
sent, that would also be referred.
N Charles J. McDonnell, clerk in the
Justices' Court, submitted the papers
in the judgment case in order
that the Mayor might Investigate that
phase of justice.
Dr. Howe corroborated _â¢ Dr. Brack
ett's testimony as to not wishing to
charge anything for his services. Wit
ness himself had told Mrs. Ames not to
worry, for he believed the National
Guard boys would advance the- money,
as. Ames was popular with them.
Mrs. Dr.* Brackett corroborated her
husband's statement regarding the mid
night telephone call from F t leishhacker
and r was positive it was Saturday
night.
â¢-Dr-C. JB. Plnkham, an assistant sur
geon at the Emergency Hospital, said
he was present' at the interview be
tween Dr. Brackett and Fleishhacker in
the latter's office and saw the $5 change
hands for the consultation' held be
tween Dr. Brackett and Dr. Hunting
ton in the Emergency Hospital. He was
positive ithe money was paid for the
consultation, for Fleishhacker had said
while the* three were together: "While
you are down here, I might as well
pay you that $5 for the consultation."
Dr. Huntington was to have been
summoned; but, as he had business of
importance, the testimony was closed
by Attorney Samuels agreeing to ad
mit the reported conversations, between
Dr. Brackett and the absent witness.
Mrs. Ames was asked regarding the
suit entered by W. F. Williams in her
name to recover $100 from A. Flelsh
hacker & Co. and positively stated she
had never authorized it nor signed any
papers in connection with it. She had
never employed Williams in any ca
pacity..
Witness had instructed Dr. Brackett
to go to Fleishhacker^ and, endeavor
to secure a settlement of her claim, as
she did not want to go into court. Dr.
Brackett did so, but was only offered
$50. This was refused, as she wanted
$400 or $500. She had signed a num
ber of papers, but had not received any
money except a little from , Flelsh
hacker.
A question as to whether she had
attended the Inquest of last Monday
wag answered in the negative, and
when asked why, said she knew,noth
ing of It until Policeman Clark called
on her to know why she had not al
tended. She positively "stated she ha 1
not been served with a * subpena,
Mayor"*Schmitz ordered his secretary to
note that fact in order to make an in
vestigation.
DENIES SIGNING PAPERS.
Mrs. Fannie . Ames . was called and
told her story amid sobs. She said Dr.
Brackett had been very kind to her
and when she told him she did not
have a cent, he told' her he would do
everything free. She did not want her
husband taken "to the City and Coun
ty Hospital, for she had a horror of
such institutions. When Dr. Brackett
suggested the German Hospital she
consented. Witness . repudiated a re
ported interview she was said to have
given, when Dr. ' Brackett had asked
her for money and for her furniture.
Dr. Brackett had never 'said anything
to her against the Cfty and County
Hospital, but the members of the Na
tional Guard had told her it would be
sure death for her husband to be sent
there. , . ?,
that It â¢wxmld ttkÂ» $100 to handle tfc* easeâ
$50 for hospital service and $50 for Incident

cent for himself, but It would taks that
amount to care for the case. - 1 eald I would
not cuarantee to pay $100, but I would pay
the bill at the hospital. Â¦ ~

At 3 o'clock in the afternoon P. J.'
Hazen, chairman of the reception com
mittee, gave a short address, followed
by Attorney L. L. Dennett, who gave,
on behalf of the^ people of the two Ir
rigation districts, the address of wel
come, to which Governr Pardee re
sponded. Hazen stated that something
over a year ago the matter of holding
a Fourth of July celebration was taken
up among the people of Modesto, but
a canvass among them revealed a
strong sentiment against holding any
celebration. The citizens wanted a
demonstration of gome kind following
the completion- of the work of con
struction upon the irrigation systems of
the Modesto and Turlock districts.
The projected Fourth of July cele
bration was abandoned and ; a com
mittee composed of representative men
of the two districts began arrange
ments for this celebration. . T t was first
proposed to hold the jubilee in the
fall of last year, but it was postponed
until this spring.
Upward of $5000 had been raised to
defray the cost of the undertaking and
the money had been' spent by forty or
fifty of the leading people of the com
munity. The Governor of the State of
California had kindly -consented to be
our honored guest at this meeting.
Hazen then announced some features
of the programme of the afternoon
and closed by introducing L. L. Den
nett of the general committee. Den
nett said it was a custom of ancient
Venice to annually "^ celebrate the
espousals or wedding of the sea signifi
cant of the wealth brought to Venice
through the avenue of the sea. These
carnivals were of great moment and
elaborate in character, and emphasized
the ' appreciation Â¦ of the people of > the
chief source and means of their" pros
perity. To-day we celebrated the wed
ding of the water and the land. It may
be said, indeed, that all periods reach-
Ing from the -beginning of things when
the Tuolumne first burst through its
mountain barriers and found its way
to the Bea have been tending to these
espoueals. The wheat grower was the
logical successor of the miner. : And
yet the wheat grower never felt that his
condition was permanent. 1 He was
always* contemplating" a larger Â¦ house
and .a different: status of operations;
He has been followed by the Irrigator,
the user 'of the water- wedded to the
land, and we have now a state of per
manence 'of settlement.' . Homes may
now be built which will, remain in
families through . successive gener
ations â always producing, always
yielding crops, the soil . never tiring in
its output when properly treated, the
communities experiencing the rise of
continuous wealth. .
Governor Pardee replied as follows:
"Ladies an^ Gentlemenâ The pleasure
you have to-day In celebrating this
union of land and water is shared by
every person In California. It Is shared
by them because your prosperity will
be shared by every 'man, woman' and
child in California. Not only this -but
the success you have achieved: will be
taken up . farther north, and ' your, ex
ample will be followed, -and your suc
cess' will "find, reflection: in the': future
successes and prosperity' which will be
realized by those who extend the great
work into other localities ! of the . State.
It Is therefore, as chief executive of
the. . State, that I can , gire , a hearty
'God bless - you' from all of the people
I am h<fe to represent." , ." . i u
The speech of the Governor closed

Little Albert Rouquett, the eight
and a half .months old child of Mrs.

anonymous letters. The witness battled
longhand' stubboVnly with i Heney over
this/subject and changed his declara
tions'several times. When first interro
'gated. upon the matter, ; on Thursday
morning, the following testimony had
been ''given Ci
' .QueEtion" by Mr. Heneyâ What make of type
"wrlter* have you? A.â Remington- :
.Â¦ How Â¦ long have . you had a Remington?
- Kver" since I opened my office.
' Have you only one typewriting machine?.
Henry P. Dlmorid, one of the defend
ants in the land frauds case, was yes
terday driven by Government cross
examination to contradict Important
testimony, given bylhim the day before.
It is agreed. by experts and* conceded
by Dimond that these anonymous'let
ters were*writte.n)on* a ;Blickensderfer
typewriter. 'JOn , Thursday,. Dimond~as
serted ; that ;. the ; last > machine of "this
make he ever owned had been soldâ he
could . hot recall \ to whomâ prior to his
going to Waehlngton^for Hyde"; in the
summer; nf 1901: Yesterday this - state
ment gave place" to : the admission Â¦ that
he had. owned,' kept In his-: office, and
used such a niachine during the very
t ime ' the ; anonymous ' letters were sent
through < the mails, "namely, - between
August, 1903, and January, 1904. ' Â¦ r "
' The ' question*, ; "Who wrote " the
anonymous letters?" now overshadows
all others raised in' the preliminary ex
amination- of 'Hyde :and ' Dimond. r
The ; atmosphere 'of the- case lias be
come so '. laden -with" electricity that a
Â«torm is liable' at any .moment to break
out openly between; Dimond arid Hyde.
Persons : in " the courtroom - yesterday
after \ the .session closed \ had a sugges
tion' of ' what might : - occur when they
saw; Dimond attempt g a conversation
with "the millionaire' land speculator.
With clenched fist, Hyde waved the
lawyer away ; and refused to hear a
word. from him. :
- The Â¦- anonymous letters . occupied
much of ;yesterday's session. The sec
ond communication sent to Government
Detective Burns was read in evidence,
and: its authorship duly denied by';D1
mond. canvassing this preg
nant subject "thoroughly Heney took up
once more the' witness' attempts^to
shield Hyde from Government investi
gation, even after he had refused long
er to act 'as Hyde's attorney. The aim
of the prosecution was to force admis
sibns*tHat Dimond then' knew; Hyde
was guilty of unlawful practices. To
this end- Dimond's letter of January. 22,
1903, -, one of the most important docu
ments in. the Government case, '.was
used as the basis of an extended exam-
inatlon.-'under which the. witness mani
fested : - :
â¢r " DIMOXD'S EXTAXGLEMEXT." '-
Anihpuror more was spent In -ques
tions about DImond's, efforts to shield
Hyde: from, the investigation started
by. the Interior Department.. These
questions ranged over^the witness* visit
to. the defendant,. Schneider, at Tucson;
his letters' to Hyde from Washington
denouncing the latter's admissions that
he-had used, irresponsible persons *in
acquiring school lands and his alleged
retirement * : from . Hyde's service on
March 1, 1903.
Most of ftll, the witness was grilled
about his letter to Hyde dated Wash
ington, January 22, , 1903, which, Heney
contended, showed a full knowledge of
Hyde's speculative methods. ,
The crcss-examlnataion of Dinlond
will continue on Monday morning.
i .Then earner the other anonymous let
terâone Detective Burns had re
ceived in answer to a second advertise
ment in the Chronicle on : ' January 10,
1904. 'The detective had asked his un
known "correspondent for "the" names
of all the parties you think have been
tampered with at the land office."; In
reply to this advertisement Burns got
the" following: letter, postmarked "San
Francisco, January 24,' 1804":
I 'have at" !asf found out the name 'of the
man") who can convict " Hyde, fj. 1 J. Barnes of

wanted." 'He has written him the "news" reg

and the ' inquisition was long and re
lentless. After repeating: his former
statement that the anonymous letters
were evidently the product of a Blick
ensderferymachine, Dimond . testified as
follows:
â¢ Mr. Heney â Did you have a tjrpewrlter when
you entered Hyde's office In June, 1901?
TeÂ». I took a -small typewriter from my
office in the Mills -building to Hyde's office.
What kind of a typewriter?
A small Blickensderfer. "When. I ; left for
Washington I packed It up and. left It there
until my return In 1902. Darin? the mmmer
of 1002 I used It occasionally. It was still at
Hyde'a office when I got back from -Washing
ton early in 1903. During my absence It bad
been locked up In my desk at Hyde's Office.
What became of it? Â¦Jg-SK'HfiSiiS
I sold It.
When? . ...
When I - took my present offices. I then
bought a Remington and turned the othei; ma

Harriman has Jong appreciated the
futility of struggling alorfg with a
burdensome Indebtedness and has been
striving j to find a way ,to reduce his
interest obligations to 5 or, 4 per cent.
He has found financial, sources for ac
quiring the necessary funds for re
funding the old bonded â¢ indebtedness/
but 'to make the scheme; 'effective It
would be necessary to ) merge the lines,
a feat he cannot, perform, with such
stringent laws as exist in Texas 5 con
fronting his . great project. Â¦Â¦Â¦ It is, this
problem of law that he is now studying,
and. while awaiting a. solution "Â¦Â¦he has
brought to the West ', the mVn that have
assured him financial support.*
":' Robert '^Goelet; although/ a : young
man, "was j made â¢ one of the party, be
cause he-?is ;in "control; of i many mil
lions of dollars, which are- ready for
good investments, and because he takes
deep interest in railroads. 'Accompany
ing Goelet is his -uncle, : Whitney War
ren,' who is Â¦&'Â¦ railroad architect. ': J. N.
Hill, r the; son of . the man; who Is fight
ing Harrimari in ; the Northern Securi
ties cask, is one of the Harriman party
for the ( purpose of seeing the Western
country south ; of "the territory con
trolled by the ; Hill lines.' â¢â¢ That he
should be a guest of Harriman, while
the latter Is fighting his -father . in , the
courts,' seems to surprise no one con
nected-with the. Harriman -party. Â¦ One
of .the latter, g discussing 'the Â¦ matter
last evening, said: ;â¢
"; "While the prominent 'i financiers of
the East "are . continually T, battling, In

the roads west -of the Missouri River
were put in the hands of. a receiver
he scurried around for money to keep

as to pledge his personal interests.

â¢ PLANNING TO REFUND.
During his last visit to San Francisco
President Harriman called into his
presence at the railroad building a
number of the department chiefs and
informed them that it would thereafter
be a rule of the company that, no' of
ficial of the road should either deny, or
affirm reports concerning, the corpora
tion if approached by outsiders, par
ticularly newspaper reporters. Appar
ently the head of the road has deter
mined to set an example for his em
ployes, for he strictly applied this rule
to his interview yesterday ;and ; dodged
around a dozen Â¦ questions on Â¦ the iplea
of absolute ignorance. He hadn't heard
a word about the reported sale .of the
North Shore road to his concern, was
equally lacking In, news regarding
changes in the operating and .traffic
departments of his railroad systems'
and had been too busy in New York to
think of any future changes along his
lines. â¢ Â£?;':â¢Â¦ Â£Â£<5C ; ---''; ; ; *'

Prfcjs.u<i.Â«. jcuatmilln naa never gained
the reputation of being a great talker,
especially to newspaper representa
tives, and he is not endeavoring to
improve his reputation in this, respect
on this trip. When questioned regard-
Ing his recent row with James J. Hill
over the Northern Securities Company,
he looked steadily into the reporter's
face as he replied that he had been
giving little attention to "the matter."
He later remarked, however, that it
was before the courts, and for that
reason he would not like to discuss it,
"even if he had been keeping track
of it."
Upon the subject of politics Mr. Har
riman was equally recticent.
. It is less than ten days ago that the
telegraph columns were filled with sto
ries from New Ycrlz concerning a pro
ject to send him as a delegate to the
Republican National Convention from
Orange County. It was said that the
railroad magnate, like many, other
Eastern financiers, was angered ,, at
President Roosevelt's stand in the rail
road merger case, that he had sought
the nomination as a delegate' to the
national convention with a view of
joining forces with any faction that
might oppose the nomination of Roose
velt. When asked yesterday for a
statement t on this subject, Mr. Harri
man quickly replied, that he "had seen
something- of the sort in the papers."
but he did not know where they had
got hold of the story.

WASHINGTON,; April Â¦ 22.â A '. thor
ough review of Mormon interference in
political affairs in: Utah- was; given to
day by Judge O. W. Powers, the -only
witness- before the Senate -Committee
on ' Privileges and Elections; in the in
vestigation ; of the' protest against Sen
ator Smoot. Several times efforts. were
made by counsel for- the) defense to
show, that his story was based on 'hear-'

an f: array of ' facts taken 'from 'signed
statements of members of /the
documents V which' are Â»a /part-; of- the
records' of rthe State, affidavits" of -per

the , church | influence was Â¦ manifested
and other evidence.
Among other, matters of Utah history

convened - Democratic Â¦ convention on
October 22,, 1895, when the question of
retaining its ticket in the, field or with
drawing , the', ticket * and , the
admission of Utah as -a .State was
raised. Judge, Powers spoke of Thatch
er's candidacy for the' Senate, and said
that four; days after Thatcher an
nounced, on a platform that he was op
posed to church interference in politics
he was'deposed- as an apostle. After
his defeat an effort .was "made to br<ng

| WASHINGTON, April 22.â The gen
eral deficiency appropriation bill occu
pied most ; of. the Senate's time, but
before it .was taken up Senator Gal
linger spoke "at some length on the
tariff policy of the Republican party.
While the reading of the deficiency bill
was in .progress Cullbfn spoke on the
Chinese exclusion bill. J., During the day
the attention of the Senate was brought
to the- amendment, of the House to
the bill for the government of the canal
zone,'- and ; some embarrassment was
created by naming . Gorman as Demo
cratic' conferee on behalf, of the Senate
in place] of Morgan, who is the senior
Democratic member of the Committee
on Interoceanic Canals, with the re
sult that both Senators declined to
serve.': .Â¦.:.'- ' . Â¦ ;, -â¢Â¦< '.; Â¦Â¦ / Â¦
Senator Cullom discussed at some
length the* provision for the regulation
of Chinese exclusion, explaining pre
vious laws andithe treaties bearing on
the 1 question. He expressed the. opin
ion that thedenouncemeht of the treaty
of 1894 v would' have the effect of re
viving the treaty of 1880, and said that
the latter treaty modifies the treaty
oft.1868. Discussing the act of 1902, he
said that the exception made in that
law^ in favor of treaty obligations had
reference to the 'treaty of 1894, which
was -the "only" treaty^ bearing on Chi
nese immigration ; then In force. He
thought it "desirable that, there should
be a specific re-enactment of former
Chinese- exclusion .laws. 'He therefore
would favor the>etention 'of such por
tion of the House provision as would
accomplish .this result. Later Cullom
formally offered an amendment to
strike out the major portion of * the
Chinese exclusion provision. .
Senator Lodge also offered. an amend
ment excluding Chinese v and other
aliens whose emigration is enpouraged
by agreement with any transportation
company. "
The reading of the bill being com
pleted the Senate adjourned.

eral MacArthur yesterday.
The papers in the case of Lieuten
ant Frederick B. Neilson have been
reviewed by Major Henry M. Morrow
and were yesterday returned to Gen
eral MacArthur. The announcement
cf the ccurt-martial's decision will
probably be made public in a few
ceys. .
ant at Fort Alcatraz, states that the
Fertry that fired upon Chris Schmid
and party last Sunday has been rep
rimanded. Schmid and his friends
were iiassing the island on a launch
trhejj without warning or provocation
They were fired at by the sentry on
.ru.'ird. A complaint xvpA made and
Major Paxton made an investigation.
It appears that according to an order
of thÂ«Â» United States Government no
person or craft Is permitted to ap
proach Alcatraz Island nearer than
200 feet without making a signal to
the sentry of their intention to ap
proach. There is, however, no notice
on or about the island to this effect
for the public's information. In the
case in question Schmid's party was
railing by the island and distant from
it about 150 feet when the sentry fired
across the bow of the launch and then
firÂ«Â»d directly at it. That the bullet
<iid not strike the boat or occupants
is a miracle. The present orders have
been modified to the extent that in
future sentries are to use common
sense when they see people of well
intent Bailing past the island. Major
Paxton is gTeatly annoyed over the
circumstance.
The army appropriation bill In the
present session of Congress provides
for enlisted strength of the signal
corps to be as follows:
Thirty-six master fignal electri
Â«:ans. .pay per month at home 575,
abroad 590: 1S2 .first-class sergeants,
poy per month at home $4 5, abroad
$54: 144 scrgcant*. pay per month at
home $34, abroad $40 SO; 156 corpo
rals, pay per month at home $20.
r.broad $24; 552 firrt -class privates,
l>iÂ»y per month at home $17. abroad
$20; 15S privates, pay per month ,at
home $13. abroad $15 60; 24 cooks,
pay per month at home $20, abroad
$24.
In addition to thÂ«? above mentioned
compensation each enlisted man re
ceives rations, clothing, quarters and
medical attendance free. There ", is
rIso an increase in nay after three
years' service has been comp! ?d.
Major Alexis R. Paston, command-
This bill provides for an increase of
*<?00 men over the present strength.
Tljese vacancies will be filled by en
listments and transfers from the line.
The Fig-nal corps is non- the most
dÂ»s=irabl? branch of th<Â» service, as it
affords an opportunity to acquire a
uood working knowledge of the use
of electrical instruments and practical
electricity in general.
Th<? new bill Increasing: the enlist
ed strength of the signal corps of thÂ»
United States army offers good
chances for bright, intelligent youns:
men who wish to entÂ»r thÂ« service.

A TALK ON TREES. /
ALAMEDA, April 22.â The city's sec
ond annual Arbor day* celebration was
held to-day, and was on a more elab
orate and impressive scale than that
of last year. Exercises were conduct
ed at all of the public schools, the pro
grammes at the six grammar schools
beginning at I o'clock in the afternoon
and at the Alameda High School one
hour later.
"Dr. C. W. Card, who was called to
attend the unfortunate woman before
she died, was positive in his an
nouncement her skull had not
been fractured, although he found" an
abrasion of the scalp. When asked if
this abrasion might have been sus
tained by a fall Dr. Card said that it
was "scarcely possible. -.
When I was first called Mrs. Grady com
plained of a headache.' After an examination
I decided she was suffering from kidney
trouble and when her temperature arose tn a
rerlous degiee I advised her removal to the
Waldeck Sanatorium, where she could aecelve
more lntellictnt treatment than . one can at
home. She srew ranldlv worse and" finally It
was evident that her kidneys had ceased to
Work altogether. Medical treatment -prove.1
unavailing and she died from .uremlo poison
"i"he' story that her skull was fractured Is
absurd and In my opinion is a tale engendered
through a family row. There -was not a
bruise or laceration on her heaJ to indicate
violence and the manner of her -death could
not have been caused by blows or a fall.
That there was a row in the house
there seems to be no question, but
whether on not Grady struck his
daughter-in-law, thereby causing her
death, appears to be much questioned.
Grady denies the assault and is susy
tained by Dr.W. G. Mianer, who says:
. An element of mystery still sur
rounds the death of <SIrs. Catherine
Grady, wife of a patrol wagon driver
connected with the Park police sta
tion, which occurred at the Waldeck
Sanatorium on Sunday last.
Mrs. D. I. Saunders of 506 Kearny
street and Mrs. D. I. Simon's of 1426
Market street, sisters of the deceased,
called on Captain of Detectives Mar
tin last night and reiterated the state
ment that they had 'previously made
at the office of Coroner Leland. This
statement was to the - effect that " a
quarrel had taken place In the home
of Mrs. Grady at 717 Devlsadfero
street on the niffht of March 22. which
culminatedfin W. D. Grady, father-in
law of the woman, striking her on the

President Roosevelt believes that the
best way for American commercial
prestige to be heightened In the mar
kets of the Orient lies through more
cordial treatment of the Chinese. He
is, of course, opposed to the admission
of coolie labor to the United States, but
radical Chinese exclusionists declare
that he and.Secretary Hay are strongly
Inclined to replace the present strict
immigration treaty, which will be abro
gated Deecember 7, with one more lib
eral in definition of Chinese profes
sional and merchant classes which may
be admitted. While, of course, Prince
Pu Lun will have no authority to rep
resent the Chinese Government in a
diplomatic capacity, the good impres
sion he is expected to carry away of
the attitude of the President and Sec
retary Hay toward his country is re
garded as excellent food for an In
crease of close commercial relations
between the two Governments.
All this gives rise' to much specula
tion whether there is not a great deal
of-tnternatlonal politics involved in the
visit of the Prince. It Is stated that
he has no official mission in this coun
try, save to visit the exposition. Nev
ertheless, the attention which the Pres
ident and Secretary Hay will bestow
upon the visitor has an indirect con
nection with American-Chinese rela
tions.
WASHINGTON, April 22.â Prince Pu
Lun, nephew of the Emperor of China
and head of the Chinese commission to
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.
will arrive in Washington to-morrow.
For three days he will be entertained
as have few visiting dignitaries In re
cent years. He will be shown especial
consideration by President Roosevelt.
Secretary Hay will give a dinner com
plimentary to the Prince Tuesday night
and the President will attend the func
tion. It will be one of the most bril
liant affair! of the season and will be
notable for the galaxy of distinguished
men attending.
In speaking of Â¦ Dennett's career,
George 8. Montgomery, the well-known
philanthropist, said to-day:
"Probably ho other man in the
United States has had so remarkable
a life as Dennett. He has been a sailor
and cook; he has been worth $1,000,000
and has given away hundreds of thou
sands for charitable purposes. No one
knows the amount of money he has
given away. .He knew the restaurant
business as no one knows it and had
a mind that could grasp a big idea.
He did not deal in small things, but
always went at ventures on a large
scale. Pie incorporated his restaurants
In New York City, Brooklyn, Balti
more, Boston and other places for
over $1,000,000 and they were bringing
him in a royal income, with which he
was lavish. "> ' 'y~
"He closed his places on Sundays,
conducting them on the temperance
plan. He pad! the highest wages, but
exacted the utmost . cleanliness from
his employes. He was blind in one
eye, but he could take in everything
with the other. When he came to the
Pacific Coast he was virtually broke.
He gave away such vast sums that he
lost control of his corporation in the
East and he was frozen out. But he
could make a success anywhere. He
was a wizard in this respect. I think
his ' present condition is due -to his
being knocked down by a car on Fourth
street in San Francisqo about a year
ago. â¢",'., : ;;. V .
"While he seemingly got well, he
has been acting strangely ever since, i
His son, â¢ George, has written to , me
from Los Angeles, stating that the
business has been wrecked there by.
the way his father hag been conducting
things." '; ; Vi
; Alfred William Dennett, famous
throughout the country for his "rapid
lunch" restaurants, was committed to
Stockton Insane Asylum to-day, a vio
lent maniac. He has been erratic, ac
cording to his friends for some months
past and has wrecked his business in
Los Angeles through his Insane acts.
He engaged in a terrific struggle with
his attendants this morning and it took
the combined efforts of three men to
strap him to his cot. The court found
that he was dangerous and a flt sub
ject for the State institution.

A bond election will be held to
morrow to determine whether Oakland
school diftrlct, comprising the city of
Oakland, and a small part of the sub
urbs in Claremont and Piedmont, shall
issue $9(0,000 in bonds, with which new
school buildings and sites and enlarge
ments to present school buildings and
Bites shall be provided. The polls
close at fundown, 6:52 p. m. The dis
trict has been divided into twenty-one
precincts, polling places having been
established at the various schoolhouses.
To the pupils of the public schools
there has been distributed circulars de
scribing the boundaries of precincts,
the purposes for which bonds are de
sired and the Board of Education's of
ficial statement on the subject.
The proposition has been submitted
as a blanket one. Thus the voter will
record his ballot either "for" or
"against" all of the bonds.
Specifically the items call for enlarge
ment of the following school sites:
Lafayette, Lincoln, Grant, Prescott,
Harrison, Grove street, Temescal,
Tompkins and Cole school lots. Pro
vision is made for the purchase of new
schoolhouse sites in the following lo
calities:
One In the neighborhood of sixtieth and

present French novelists very rarely
â¢make the French girl the principal
character In their novels. They prefer
to study the married woman, whose
character is more definite, more com
plete. However, wandering through
the books of to-day one now and then
comes upon the presentation of a girl
character. Are these girls of the novel
the girls of real life? In these creations
of the novelists do Frenchmen recog
nize their sisters or their sweethearts?
To answer this question M. Dupouey
rpoke of a number of types of young
girl* among those described in litera
ture, analyzed these types bj' means of
?Samples from the most celebrated
novels, and having thus defined the
type he compared it with reality. Thus
he distinguished first those whom he
called pure girlsâ Henriette Seill, for in
etance, in Paul Bourgrefs "Terre Prom
ise"; next, weak girls, most Gyp's and
Marcel Provost's; finally; strong girls,
who are entirely new in modern France
and are the result of the gradual fall
ing off in the number of marriages. In

AIRSHIP WILL ATTEMPT
TO SOAR THIS MORXIXG
Inxor.tor Says He Will Try to Encircle
The Call^Tourr and. Return
to Mooring.
The Greth airship, which was readj'
to mount to the clouds yesterday and
traverse the aJÂ»- in all directions at the
' t will of the navigator, was compelled
* to postpone its ascent on account of
the heavy winds blowing at the time.
This morning, however, if the weather
is propitious, the "California Eagle,"
as she is called, will leave her moor
iags. corner of Eleventh and Market
Vtreets, and. slowly risir.gr. will en
deavor to prove to the world that the
r.'avigatloTi of thÂ« air has become ac
complished.
It is the intention of Dr. August
GrÂ«th, inventor of the ship, to have
her move over the southern portion of
the city, encircle The Call building
and then return to her quarters. Her
first trip last fall was crowned with
*a large meed of success and with her
improvements and augmented motor
power she stands chances of carrying
out the programme outlined for her.
If to-day is fine and no wind blow
ing the early rising citizens will un
doubtedly enjoy the unusual sight of
Beeing an air vehicle controlled by
human agencies floating over their
heads.

If Aladdin's lamp had burst its en
tire brilliancy over the city of San
Francisco it could not have thrown
more beautiful rays than did the dis
play of diamonds and other magnificent
Jewels that were exhibited yesterday
by the new firm, the Bohm-Brlstol
Company.
The concern has for a quarter of a
century been known as the leading Jew
e!ry house of Denver, Colo. Owing to
Its wonderful success in that line it
decided to seek other and larger fields.
With that end in view the company
picked out the "Western metropolis
xrith the idea that it would outdo
In splendor in placing Its stock before
the public anything that has ever been
Feen here. For months it has been fit
ting up as fine a store at 104-110 Geary
e treet a* the skill of architects and
builders could conceive, and to that
end has accomplished its design. Fix
tures of solid mahogany cut from the
heart of the tree and beautifully blend
ed give the store itself a pretty appear
â¢ence. ar.d the myriads of lights, that
ere backed by the richly tinted sides
end ceilin?, add to the pleasant effect.
And the jewels! How alluring, how
dazzling! The prismatic effect of that
collection of rare and costly jewels
makes the beholder believe that he Is
Jn a trance. Necklaces of solid dia
xnonds fill a case of goodly dimensions.
Among them a collar, set with the pre
cious white stones and costing $40,000,
Clves one the feeling of being In the
rresence of royalty. Brooches of all
designs, .comprising butterfly. 6Pider
a-nd other shapes, and valued from
$1000 to $5000 are next to attract the
eye- An emerald ring about the size
of a Email pea and worth $4000 is in
deed a gem. This fine stone was located
, by Mr. Bohm while he was traveling In
L/ondon and experts have pronounced
it one cf the most perfect In existence.
But when it comes to an array of cost
â¢ly Jewels, a pear shaped pearl of 62
grains, which the firm treasures as Its
leader, certainly holds pre-eminence.
The princely sum of $60,000 is given
as its worth. Gold purses as high as
55C0. shell combs ranging from $2 to
5300 and many other articles add to
the display.
An abundance of silverware, loads of
rncst costly watches and other articles
that go to make up a grand store are
on BhoV. Of the many clerks em
ptoyed are all residents of San Fran
<isco ar-1 have earned reputations in
'}><cb\ stores. The public exhibition will
be held this morning at 10 o'clock.

or lessens the steady earner . his Â¦ wages it Is
ti be regretted* that: so many thousands of
men do. not let well cnouth- alone. ;
â¢ With some men the: more they* get the more
they want. : Mind you,'- 1 say. and, emphasize
"some .men,',' Â¦ until' the capitalists 'and mer

employ them "are Â¦Â¦"/compelled to throw them
off In order, t.o seek'relief from pressure.
Imagine -to-day the number of strikes, the
urrasy : condition of.,; the laborer. Had the
striking employes 'of .the land continued their
work with the wages they were receiving they
would have gained: more In the long. run than
by being, thrown out of employment, losing
their wages, Jeopardizing the -support of their
wives and families and in the end having
gained no specific advantage.
WAGES NEVER BETTER.
On the other side there Is an all responsi
ble duty on thar part of the employer that
wages be paid adequate to keep the workman
In some Â¦ degree of comfort ' so that hik life
is not one of lengthened hours and undue toll
for a. remuneration which ; proves almogt un
sufHclent'to eke out one's existence.
Â¦ But : I am told by the conservative and
thinking: â¢worklngmaji that there never was
I a time in the history of the wage-earner
'.when the working people had more money than
now. .Savings banks are {till almost to burst
ing and- the problem teems to be, to return
to my former phrase, the adjustment between
employer and employe, and the placÂ« for that
â¢adjustment. In my humble â¢ opinion, is to be
found In a board of arbitration which should
be, composed, .not of those- Tt-ho know nothing
about the ; particular labor Involved, but 'of
parties most Intimately and par&mountly con

The grroning importance of Salina
Cruz is beginning to impress itself upon
the commercial world and the name
of the Mexican port promises to be
come familiar as San Francisco with
shippers and travelers whoso goods
and whose Journeys call for trans
continental and trans-Pacific transpor
tation. Guatemalans and the residents
of other â¢ Central American republics
are now going to New York by way
of Salina Cruz Instead of through this
city or by the isthmus route. The Kos
mos liner Hermonthls, which arrived
here yesterday from Hamburg 'and
South and Central American ports,
landed at the Mexican port a party
of thirty wealthy Guatemalans bound
for Xew York and St. Louis. The
Tehauntepec Railroad will carry them
to El Paso and its overland connec
tions the remainder of their long Jour
ney. The establishment of a line of
passenger steamers between' Salina
Cruz and the Orient is In contempla
tion and by the time the Mexican Gov
ernment has completed the extensive
dock and wharf scheme now under con
struction at that port Salina Cruz will
be a serious factor in the battle for the
Oriental trade.
The Hermonthls brought 6S0O tons of
cargo, which included 12,000 bags of
coffee*. The coffee crop now. .being
moved to market, and in the moving
of which the Kosmos line is doing its
full Ehare, is a generous one.' but next
year's promises to be one of the best
ever harvested.
The Hermonthis was 110 days com
ing from Hamburg. In addition to her
big cargo she brought treasure valued
at $13,950 and twenty-one passengers.
The latter included the following
named:
C Sauerbrey and wife. Maria, and Olga
Sauerbrey, Carlos Maul. May Obst, John Belitr.
Q. Borghl H. Panelli. Juan Ricca, Eliza Rleca.

CALIFORNIA RAILROADSâ X. T.
Z., City. The first railroad in Califor
nia was the Sacramentd Valley road,
which placed platform cars' on its
track on the 17th of August. 1S35. con
veying thereon a party to a point ten
miles out of Sacramento. The road
was opened to Folsom February 22.
1856. The road was opened to Shinzle
Springs, twelve miles from Placervflle,
June 20, 1865. The San Jose road was
opened to Mayfield in October. 1SS3.
and on January 16.1S64, it was opened
to San Jose. In 1569 it was extended to
Gilroy.
ETHEREAL mildness has not yet appeared east
of the Rockies. Snpw, a foot of it, -is in evidence
from St. Paul to St. Louis, and on the. Ohio River
and in Kentucky. 'The temperature has fallen far
toward zero. and fruit and crops are in trouble. Whet)
sleigh riding is compulsory ori April 20'and railroads
are blocked by snow over such a wide region in the
East it is in order, to invite the victims of such weather
to California; * 1
On the same day the. temperature here, in the same
latitude as JThicago, was 54, and strawberries just ripen
ing. . In the latitude of St. Louis "it was 58, and at some
points 65, and grain is heading. Some of the deciduous
fruits are as' big as marbles and cherries will be^ ripe
in three weeks. The whole landscape is green and wild
grass is 18 inches high. We 'Â¦% may observe also that
these temperatures are below our normal for'this' time
of year. ( ' . \ " '..
If Eastern people know when they are not well <- off
and want to know, where they can be well off . they
shouldshake the April snow from their shoes and head
for California as soon, as possible. This is the only
winterless pa*t of the continent, and : if people want to

A\\ Ancient Secret.
Lord Elgin, the first British Minis
ter to Japan, presented to the Shogun
on behalf of the Queen a small yacht
of 400 tons, named the Emperor, and
this was the first steam vessel owned
by the Japanese Government. Shortly
after the restoration . the Mikado's
Government purchased f r&m the United
States Government the Stonewall Jack
son, an ironclad ram of 1200 tons bur
den, and this was the^ first ironclad
Â¦owned by the Japanese. In Septem
ber, 1867, the Shogun obtained from
the British Government the services of
Commander Tracy, R. N. (now Admiral
Sir R. Tracy), and a small party of
British naval offlcersi and men, for the
purpose of giving systematic instruc
tion in seamanship and gunnery to
young I Japanese officers; _but five
months later the revolution whici
drove the Shogun from his position
broke out, and the Naval Mission, as
"It was termed, was withdrawn, first
to Yokohama, and then home to Eng
land. In the. year 1873, when the new
Government had got somewhat settled,
a second naval mission, headedH by
Commander Douglas, R. N. (now Ad
miral Douglas), consisting of about
thirty men and officers, was lent by
the British Government, .and during
six years it did excellent service in
training officers and laying the founda
tion of the Japanese navy. A naval
college was built in Toklo, and a very
complete course of. study and training
was organized! The naval college was
later on. removed to Etajlma, in the
Inland Sea, an academy for senior offi
cers was established afTokio, and gun*
nejy and torpedo schools were also or
ganized. Yokusuka dockyard, which
had been started under the Shogun
by French engineers, was extended and
I is now a very large and important es
tablishment, and generally the organ
ization of the Naval Department was
put . on a : basis' which enabled it to
; develop on right lines and lead up . to
â¢its present very important position. In
1877 the Japanese seriously entered on
the acquisition cf modern fighting ships
and in- that year the first ship espe
cially built for them* in Englandâ a
broadside central battery ship of 3700
tonsâ designed by Sir Edward Reed,
was launched on the Thames. She was
followed by several small Dut power
fully armed ironclads. Since the war
with China a great expansion has tak
en place, and at the present time Japan
has a navy which in offensive and de
fenBlve armor. kÂ» speed and steaming
capacity, will hold its own with any in
the world of equal size. .. .

GOOD work has been performed. by the Santa Cruz
Sentinel for Santa Cruz County by the publica
tion of a handsomely illustrated story of "Why I
Moved West,'' which is sent out in, supplement form for
handy , distribution. The illustrations are confined to
photographic views of Santa Cruz County in* its variety,
which collectively make up. a brave show. A glimpse at
these is sure to prompt desire on the part of all to per
sonally visit the localities.
One picture presents Santa Cruz, a modern city of
10,000 inhabitants. -Another shows a ,trainloadof eigh
teen cars of apples leaving Watsonville in October for
the East. Lands that yield 300 sacks of potatoes to the
acre engage the camera. Pacific avenue, in the city of
Santa Cruz, looking southward, and the drive that fol
lows close to the edge of the sandstone cliffs, with the
strong line of white ocean foam on its verge,, are de
picted. Various vistas of the bathing beach at Santa
Cruz, the natural bridge on the. cliff drive,' Capitola, a
typical Santa Cruz landscape, each has attention pic
torially. * ~ , '
..-Then , there are .scenes that attract, the attention and
wonderment of all visitors that arc given prominence.
Not the least in interest of this series is a strawberry
patch 150 acres in extent. Of course the big trees are
used with effect.
r| Santa VCruz is taking proper measure^, to become
known better. No community in California can afford to
do less. The area of^this imperial State is so great and
the lines of travel are so long, that the casual visitor
never sees more than a few of the beautiful cities and
town^of California. It has been the purpose of The Call
to give ample space to helping all sections of the State.
The results have been gratifying. The papers of the in
terior necessarily must be relied upon to supply much
local information. This they do well. When they ad
vance their own sections,, the prosperity that they pro
mote brings rewards commensurate with the endeavor.
This is true of sectional work and also of toil directed
to the promotion of the welfare of the State as a whole.
Following his article in the last Sunday Call on "How
Fighters Break Their Own Bones," Professor Van -Court
of the Olympic, Club has written the most sweeping
criticism that has ever been made against the modern
boxers, under the title "Foul Fighting in the Ring/' and
iHustrated.it with the' most striking set of photographs
cf pugilists in action ever reproduced in a newspaper.
Perhaps the most 'pleasing examples of up-to-date
journalistic art will be found in the full-page picture of
popular' society women painted from* life by Mrs. Rosa
Hooper Plotner and, the full-page reproduction of one
of the. most striking jpaintings at the Spring Exhibition
at the Hopkins .Art by E. Spitzer, entitled
"Noontime in a Dressmaking* ; Establishment." â¢, -
- In addition to all the foregoing there is much more
of equal merit, , notably "Migration and Matrimony";
."Spring Freshet of Fiction," by Robert W. Ritchie; the
"Scrap Book Page,- "Our Army Signal- Service Which
the;Japs Copy," etc.;,; etc., all making up a magazine of
rare excellence. . . :
In 'The Million-Dollar Freight Train," Frank Spear
man begins a new series of railroad stories, more thrill
ing and stronger by far than any that have yet appeared
in the Sunday Call from his pen. Once a reader of
Spearman's stories, always an ardent "admirer. His tales
cannot be equaled anywhere in the world.
In the first section of the Sunday Call appears the
third installment of . Archer .Butler. Hulbert's remark
able novel of Korean superstition- and- Russian secret
intrigue in the Far East, "The Queen -of Quelparte,"
which is something more than histprically,true. It has
a love story that is fascinatingly absorbing.
Next in line, Albert Sonnichsen presents "Colonel
Lala's Special Devil," one of the weirdest but at. the
same time one of the most characteristic stories .ever,
written of the American army in the Philippines. It is
humorous and pathetic in turn, but at all times exciting.
As a contrast most pleasing to the women is the full
page of the latest fashions selected and described, by
Augusta Prescott, and illustrated with the best photo
graphs that ever appeared in the Sunday Call. In this
connection there might also be mentioned the newly
established page, edited by Madge Moore, entitled
"What Women Want to Know," which is designed par
ticularly to answer the, multitude of questions that are
always pouring in to. the Sunday Call from women who
cannot find a solution of difficulties" in' any: other way.
ARCHBISHOP MONTGOMERY, Jack" London, Je
rome K. Jerome, Frank H. Spearman, Archer
Butler Hulbcrt, Albert Sonnichsen, Augusta Pres
cott, Professor de Witt C. Van Court, Mrs. Rosa'
Hooper Plotner, E. Spitzer â these names, standing for
all that is best in literature, art and the world's greatest
work in general, will be found at the head of just a
few of the leading articles in the Sunday Call to-mor
row, making the Magazine Section one ofc the most im
portant editions of the year. Such notable names, in
deed, cannot be found at one time in any other news
paper in the West. . ,
Archbishop George Montgomery, Coadjutor of San
Francisco, in a very virile article, tells of the. Catholic
plans for the public schools and why religious train
ing should go hand in hand with secular education. J/
Jack London has written for this edition one of the
best full-page stories that ever came from his pen. -vlt
is "The Scorn of. Women.-"-- It analyzes the primitive
emotions that rise uppermost in both j men and women
when they come under the spell of the great , frozen
north, analyzes them in a way to make women's hearts
ache and men utter maledictions upon their "own" sex for
their perfidy.
In contrast to "The Scorn of Women," Jerome K.
Jerome has an illustrated article on "Unpainted Heroes"
that is nothing short of side-splitting in its rare humpr,
while as for the next name on the list, it is one that
every one knows.

A Confession.
A famous physician, once, golnjf
through the hosoital -wards told a new
patient to "put out his tongue." It
was pointed, with a streak down the
center. "You see here, gentlemen, an
infallible sign of gastritis." "Have
you any appetite?" "I could eat *
horse," said the patient. "It is gas
tritis.' nevertheless. Any thirst?" "No,
no thirst." "Gastritis, notwithstand
ing.' Any pain in your stomach?"
"None at all, sir!" "Well, you see the
pointed tongue, gentlemen; it, Is gas
tritis! Fifty leeches to the stomach!"
The anecdote suggests many lessons.
j and perhaps to every reader It will re
call memories of similar experiences.
"Make a snap diagnosis and stick toi
it," was the advice of another well
known teacher. But we are nowa
days fast learning better than that â
if not a^JJetter science, at least a bet
ter policy. The mystery of disease
bears too heavily upon the conscience
of the modern physician to permit him
to judge hastily from insufficient data
and from single symptoms. The in
dividuality of each case of disease,
when closely studied, demonstrates
that none is like another and that the
best rule in diagnosis and treatment is
to have no rule. â American Medicln*.
Clinical Prejudices.
It is Chamberlain â the masterful,
pushful, resourceful man, a year older
than himself, but much youn
ger in appearance and . still
more so in powers of adapt
ability^ to altered conditions â
who has sidetracked the Baronet. The
Chamberlain gospel of commercial re
generation by means of protection, re
taliation and preferential colonial tar
iffs, which so many of his party have
?spoused, he regards as blasphemous
heresy against the one true inspired
faith â free trade â and is convinced
that it can lead only to political per
dition and the weeping, wailing and
gnashing of teeth that accompanies
overwhelming defeat. Too loyal to
Whig traditions of fealty to fight
against his party, too true to his con
victions to follow it along the untried
paths whither Chamberlain would
lead it. Sir Michael has no other re
course than to become practically a
Parliamentary non-combatant and
jjonentity. or withdraw from the field.
It will be generally thought that he
has chosen the less ignoble part.
There was a hot time in the Cabinet
v.hen, as Colonial Secretary. Chamber-
Jain tried to boss Sir Michael. It ended
in Sir Michael resigning the Chancel
lorship of the Exchequer. Subsequent
ly Chamberlain resigned his post. But
nothing could illustrate more strikingly
the essential difference between the two
men than the fact that the Birming

ever in the nation's eye, while the Bar

When a nickname sticks to a man it
is generally because of its innate ap
propriateness. That is why the epithet
which the turbulent Irish members be
stowed on him when he was Irish Sec
retaryâ"Black Michael"â has clung to
him ever since. His stern expression of
countenance seldom relaxes in Parlia
ment. A frown is seen on it much
oftencr than a smile. He has always
taken the game of politics very serious
ly. He has none of that exuberant joy
In controversy which causes many men
to seek refreshment in verbal warfare.
His is the bulldog's temperament- He
has never gone around seeking trouble,
but when attacked his eyes glow, he
turns savagely on his assailant and
generally manages to hurt him some
where, for Â¦ to an Irascible temper he
unites' a ehan> and bitter tongue, and
has a genius for discovering his op
ponent's raw" spot. Lord Randolph
Churchill found this out when he start
ed In to "smash the old Conservative
gang." and decided that Sir Michael
was a eood man to let alone.
Round about his own country seat
he is said to be an amiable man
enough, but that trait he has always
studiously concealed in the House of
Commons. Hence he has never been
popular there. Many a time in the lob
bies and lounging rooms he has been
known to pass by his intimate ac
quaintances without a word or so much
33 a nod of recognition. They do not
resent it, knowing that no rudeness is
sjitcnded by it. It is just his way.
Another peculiarity of his is that of
soliloquizing aloud when others' are
â¢peaking. In this Vay he has often

Michael cannot be regarded as an old
man as old parliamentary hands go. He
is only 67 and entered Parliament
when he wa-s 27. Four years later
that shrewd judge of men. Disraeli,
â¢discovered" him and made him Un
der Secretary of the Home Depart
ment. Thereafter his political ad
vancement was rapid. From 1874 to
IS" 8 he was Chief Secretary for Ire
land. In 1S78. two years after Cham
berlain had made his political debut,
he was appointed Colonial Secretary-
From 1885 to 1866 he was Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and president of
the Board of Trade from 1688 to 1892.
In 1695 he was again entrusted with
the nation'? purw strings, resigning
in 1902. He -has held office longer
than any of his Conservative col
leagues.
Under ordinary conditions the man
who had served his party so ably,
faithfully and zealously would have
waited for a fitting opportunity to
make hi? exit from the Commons' by
way of the House of Lords, with a
peerage to console him in that region
of innocuous calm for the loss of ac
tuaj political power - . and the ap
proaching infirmities of age. But Sir
Michael has put all this from him.
With his fighting powers tÂ»till undl
rninishÂ«*d he has decided to sheath
his sword and retire from the field of
battle to devote himself to those pas
toral pursuits for which his 4000
acres afford ample scope.

an ordinary man. They breed In May
and June. At this period their bright
colored plumage Is faded. It assumes
its most radiant hues in winter. When
first hatched the young have a straight
bill, which after a time develops into
one of bent shape. Their first plu
mage is grayish white and* passes
through various tints of pink, rose, car-,
mine or vermilion to the full scarlet
of the adult, which reaches its deepest
shade on the wings. Several years are
necessary to perfect the final gaudy
plumage.
Much, then, may be done by skillful
diplomacy. Nothing would bring the
authorities in Lhasa to a quicker per
ception of their duties than a fear that
their persistent refusal - to treat our
Commissioners with respect may com
pel us to negotiate direct with and
therefore, of course, greatly strengthen
their rivals. If so the Dalai Lama will
have himself alone to blame. At pres
ent it seems that the wisest course,
whatever action is taken by Lhasa,
may be to enter into a' friendly jtreaty^
to mutual advantage with Tashe-
Lhunpo. It lies with us to restore her
to the position she- once occupied,' a
position from which she was ousted
only Toy the now dead and ridiculous
suzerainty of China. She, far more
than Lhasa, would guarantee the
northern approaches to India. The
Tsang-po, or Brahmaputra, forms an
excellent natural boundary -between
Northern and Southern Tibet. We may
be content to have guaranteed the in
dependence of Southern Tibet In return
for a friendly neutrality and isolation
which the examples of Nepal and Bhu;
tan have already shown us to be the
best reinforcement of the obstacles that
nature has somewhat lavishly spread
in the way of the invader of " India
from the north- Â¦Â¦Â¦.'-...
The balance of power is fairly even.
The Kaions. or great Ministers of State,
and the Da-pens, or generals, are fair
ly distributed between the two prov
inces. But the presence of the Chinese
Amban and of the three populous mon
asteries of Lhasa, with their annual
Chinese subsidy, turns the scale against
Tashe-Lhunpo. During the sojourn of
the mission at Khambajong last year
the friction between the two Lamas
was repeatedly emphasized. Technical
ly speaking, the mission occupied a
position upon ground under the, gov
ernment of the Tashe Lama. Early in
the diplomatic contest Lhasa sent a
peremptory order to Tashe-Lhunpo de
manding why the Pollings, as the Eng
lish are called in Tibet, had been per
mitted to Intrude, and insisting upon
their immediate expulsion. The Tashe
Lama, knowing well, indeed, as
Lhasa that the mission had proceeded
to Khamba by direct permission of
China, took no steps to obey this In
junction or annoy the British deputa
tion in any way. Every offensive ac
tion was the immediate work of the
Lhasan authorities. By thenvthe Eng
lish camp was placed out of bounds
to all under their government. From
Tashe-Lhunpo and Shigatse visitors,
inquisitive and amused but always re
spectful, arrived daily. Two men at
tached to the mission, who were by
birth Tibetan but by domicile inhabit
ants of La-chung, in Sikkim, were ar
rested, tortured and apparently, though
this is not no certain, put to death by
the Lhasans. The men of Tashe-Lhun
po, as this outrage was perpetrated
in their own capital of Shigatse, ex
pressly disowned to Mr. White all re
sponsibility for the' event, for which
satisfaction will ultimately be demand
ed. The Abbot of .Tafhe-Lhunpo, the
second in rank in tWe province ot
Tsang, paid a long and courteous visit
to the mission," and expressed himself
in a very different manner from that
of the terrified Chinese representative
Ho or the curt insolence of the Lhasan
envoys. As a result the Dalai Lama,
who had proposed to pay a vi&it of
ceremony to Tashe-Lhunpo in the
course of the winter, countermanded his
orders, and' remains at Lhasa. It is
not an exaggeration to say that, as
the Grand Lama of Tashe-Lhunpo re
gards the attempt of the Indian Gov
ernment to open up amicable relations
with Tibet as in no way compromising
either the religious or political inde
pendence of Tibet, he is not wholly
displeased at the terror and anxiety
which the ! ostrich-like policy of the
Dalai Lama betrays. It is the opinion
of every one who has been qualified
to form an opinion that a v very real
friendliness is felt and, so'far as their
present servienee permits, is displayed
by the men of Tashe-Lhunpo and Shi
gatse.
The relations between the two
Grand Lamas of Tibet are of especial
interest at the present moment. The
history of the migration of Tibetan au
thority from Tashe-Lhunpo to Lhasa
is clearly known. The former Lama is
a perpetual reincarnation of Manju-sri
or AmiUibha, the latter of Avaloskites
vara, the pupil of Amitabha. Spiritu
ally, therefore, the Tashe Lama, or
Panchen Rimpoehe â "Glorious Teach
er" â as he is more ceremonially
named, is the superior of the Dalai
Lama of Lhasa. But the assistance of
Kushi Khan, who was called in by the
Dalai Lama in 1642 to prevent the de
predations of a native lord, Tsang-po
by name, of Shigatse, secured for Lha
pa the undisputed sovereignty of cen
tral Tibet, which is now roughly de
fined by the province of U. The other,
province, that of Tsang, was indeed
left to the Tashe Lama, but Kushi
Khan, partly from indolence and part
ly from favoritism, allowed the tem
poral authority over both provinces to
become transferred gradually to Lha
sa. Thus the spiritual superior of the
Dalai Lama became temporarily his
inferior, and a somewhat anomalous
rivalry between the two great heads
of Lamaism was thus begun, which
continues to the present day.
There is no question that among the
common people the Grand Lama of
Tashe-Lhunpoâ which is a great mon
astery a mile or so from Shigatse, the
town of second importance in Tibet â
is regarded with even greater awe
than is the Dalai Lama. The Chinese
Regent, when one exists, pays to the
former greater respect, and Sarat
Chundra Dass, in his exceedingly in
teresting record of his travels, men
tions a curious legend that the end of
Lamaism and of Tibet will be marked
by the withdrawal of the Tashe â not
the Dalai â Lama to Shambala, the
Utopia of the Buddhists.

The import of the issue runs far beyond the, railroad corporation and the carmen. It- reaches
all the business and nearly all the homes in- the city! Tliere is scarcely a family in the community that
would not be more or less injuriously affected by a strikeâ more or less benefited by a ballot over

On behalf of the' community as a whole/ and wiitlioiit taking sides in the controversy between
the corporation and the union, The Call enters a plea' for the maintenance of peaceful relations^between
them. The appeal gees directly to the 2000 men who compose "the Carmen's- Union and with* whom the
decision of the issue now rests. They are not asked. to yield anythirtg to which they are entitled, nor
to surrender any aspirations toward bettering the terms of labor for themselves and for their fellow
workers. They are asked to do nb : niorethan give, due consideration to the interests of the com
munity in the issue and to vote in a way \ that will advance their own welfare by conserving the wel
' No reflecting member of trie union can be ignorant of the fact that the ballot on Monday will
determine, whether or no we are to have a prolonged period of strife between two powerful forces in
the community, and thaÂ£ as a result of siich strife the transportation facilities of the city would be dis
organized, there would be danger of scenes of riot and bloodshed similar to those which have recently
disgraced Chicago and the beginning of an era of antagonism between the employers and the employes
of the roads that would almost certainly prevent the attainment of any desired improvement of the
roads or of the service fora long time to come. .
The people of San Francisco, whether they sympathize with the carmen or the railroad, are on
the side of peace in this issue. To the public' at large the terms offered by the company seem fair and
lust. They constitute, at any rate, a good basis to continue work and afford no justification for a
strike which would so seriously injure the whole community. Two years ago the carmen had a cause
that was supported by public opinion, and, as a consequence, they Avon. They have no such support
now. The well-ni^h universal demand is. for the continuance of business and the streetcar service

number of "sweepers required in each

timate of the cost of all apparatus re

and by its own employes,: who shall' be
paid a I minimum wage of $2 SO a day,
instead of letting out by contract as

The board' decided to request the
Board of Supervisors to r appropriate
the sum of $6637 to repave with bi

The combine is predicting all kinds
of trouble for the blacklisted dealers,
but the latter declare they have noth
ing to fear and that they will continue
to carry on their business as usual.
It was stipulated further that mem
bers of the association would not pa
tronize the ex-members, thus practi
cally declaring a boycott on those that
refused to pay the assessment. Each
of the signers of the agreement re
ceived a list or the names of the deal
ers who were to be boycotted. The
following names appeared on the list:
C. J. Lercari & Co., J. Demartini &
Co., Stewart & Co., Grey & Barbieri &
Co., Campodonico & Burns, A. Nardini
& Co.,J. J. Duffy & Co., Chiuda & Bot

retti, C. LippI, Quadros & Joseph, Des
lmone & Co., A. Friant & Co., and Gi
ovannoni & Pera.
The action of the committee created
much ill feeling among the members,
particularly among small dealers who
felt that they were being taxed merely
to fight the battles of the. larger con
cerns and they flatly refused to pay
the assessment. These dealers were
then informed that the sum would be
withheld from the deposit of $20 which
members had deposited with the sec
retary of the organization as a guar
antee of good faith when the organiza
tion was formed. The disgruntled
dealers thereupon withdrew their de
posits and resigned from the associa
tion. They were not molested for
some time, but lately the officers of
the association decided to wage a vig
orous warfare upon them.
Yesterday a committee consisting of
three well known potato men called
upon all dealers who are still in the
association, soliciting signatures to an
agreement, stipulating -that all ex
members who are still In business
would not be granted credit, but would
be compelled to pay spot cash for all
produce purchased from members of
the combine.
PRACTICALLY A BOYCOTT.
ILIi FEELING CREATED.
The trouble between the members
of the Wholesale Produce Dealers' As
sociation generally known as the Po
tato Dealers' Association, caused^ by
the action of Its executive com
mittee in levying an assessment
upon the members to pay the
costs of the legal proceedings against
the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners, has broken out afresh and a
bitter war Is threatened among local
handlers of country produce. Twenty
four firms, Including twelve large and
influential concerns, which refused to
pay the assessment, have withdrawn
from the association and it is not un
likely that more will follow.
The trouble had its origin in De
cember, 1903, when the permits to sell
perishable produce on 'the State
wharves, which had previously been
issued to Wolf & Sons, Wetmore
Brothers, MtDonough & Runyon and
L. Scatena & Co., were .revoked by
the board for alleged violations of the
Woodward law. These firms then car
ried the matter to the courts and the
association was called upon to defray
the expenses of the litigation by the
merchants involved, who claimed that
they, as representative firms of* the
commission business, were acting in
the interests of all dealers that were
members of the association. The exe
cutive committee of the organization
met to consider the request and after
deciding upon favorable action voted
to levy an assessment on all members
in order to raise the necessfry funds.

cheerfully confessed that she had
placed them there with intention of
applying a match and burning down
the building. She could not, or would
not, explain to Judge Mogan why she
had acted with such apparent malice,
and she will be sentenced to-day for
vagrancy.
For assaulting and attempting to
rob two women in the tenderloin dis
trict William Nolan, alias William
Bray, must answer in the Superior
Court, with a bond of $2000 demanded
in each case. He is 18 years* of age,
and the prosecuting testimony showed
that he is a novice in footpadry, as he
left himself open to easy identification
by both women, neither of whom had
more than B0 cents in her possession
when he waylaid her.
"Where's my wedding clothes V he
shouted at Pierce, who stared at hinr
In a dazed way. "Gimme back my
wedding suitâ that I wouldn't lose for
a fortune â and I'll not prosecute you.
Where are they?"
By that time the bailiff's gavel was
In play and the Judge was holding up
an admonitory hand.
"Silence, or I'll convict you for con
tempt," came from the bench. "If you
have complaint to make againEt this
defendant it can be made formally.
Who are you, anyway?"
"Me? I'm William Barnett, and I can
be found at 869 Market street. That
man stole â "
"Well. Mr. Barnett, you can swear
to a warrant and have this man tried
for stealing your trousseau. But if
you now say another word in this court
I'll send you upstairs for contempt."
Mr. Barnett's struggle to quench his
pent-up wrath turned his countenance
a deep purple, but discretion won out.
Mr. Pierce will be sentenced to-day.
"He has not been summoned to testify
and he has not been sworn."
But the unsummoned one was not
to be stayed. Advancing with defiant
mien to the rail, he resumed his ora
tory with Increased vehemence. , f
"I know that man's, character!" he
shouted, pointing a shaking forefinger
at 'the defendant. "1 know his char
acter, and it's no good. He's a thief.
He stole my wedding suit. Heâ"
"I object to this man's testimony^*
yelled the attorney for the defense.
"Character testimony" of a kind the
defendant did not relish was voluntar
ily adduced in the case of Fred Pierce,
on trial before Judge Mogan on the
charge of stealing a live canary from
a Kearny street ornithological empo
rium. The defendant's guilt was
proved, ar.d the Judge, preliminary to
convicting him of petty larceny, in
quired if there was any evidence as
?o his previous character. Ere his at
torney ccmld respond there rose from
amid the spectators a stout gentleman
of choleric facial expression and rau
cous voice.
"Vy? How could I lock der door ven

Hauska Francis told why he had
flourished a large knife in dangerous
proximity to the bared tnroat of one
Mr. Stewart, and also why he had dis
played the weapon in a threatening
manner to Senora Cypriana Lasa in
her boarding-house at 723 Broadway.
"She gef me a room, Shoodge," said
Herr Francis, "dot efery von un der

"Why dWn't you lock the door of
your apartment and thus keep out in
truders?" asked his Honor Mt-jan.
Mr. Osborn declined to answer, and
the case was continued until he has
made up his mind to give the court
the enlightenment It yearns for.
F. C. Osborn, dry goods clerk, es
corted a young woman to her home on
Fulton street at a late hour last Sat
urday night, and after bidding her au
revoir at the door he suddenly drew
from one of his pockets a fully-loaded
revolver and began unloading its con
tents into the circumambient atmos
phere. Policemen hurried from all
quarters to the spot where Mr. Os
born stood, and the first bluecoat to
arrive dexterously disarmed and ar
rested him. â¢
"What did you want to perforate the
air for?" inquired Judge Mogan.
The defendant stammered something
about "feeling good" at the time of
the shooting.
"What made you feel good?" asked
the court.
"Girl," "proposal," "celebration," were
among the words murmured in reply.
"I inftr from your masticated lan
guage," quoth his Honor, "that there
was a girl, a proposal of marriage, an
acceptance and a law-smashing cele
bration of the event by you. We must
have further elucidation. Who pro
posedâthe girl or you? This Is leap
year, you know, and it was her pre
rogative to pop the question If she
so desired. Which of you popped it""
Twelve months shall come and go ere
â¢Toughy" Clifford returns to the scene
of his former rowdyish triumphs, which
is the Barbary Coast, and during that
period letters addressed "care County
Jail" will reach him. When he ap
peared for sentence yesterday Judge
Mogan gave him three months for dis
turbing the peace, six months for
drunkenness and disorderly conduct
and three months for vagrancy â a
rcund year in all. Ruth Preston, who
was arrested with Clifford and con
victed of peace disturbance and vag
rancy; was sent to prison for sixty
days.
A strong plea was made for leniency
in the case of Clifford, but the Judge
turned a deaf ear to all appeals, as
the fellow's character as a bully and
a blackleg has been notorious for
years. The woman, who appeared in
gorgeous apparel to receive sentence,
took her sentence stoically, while the
man was visibly affected by the se
verity of the dose prescribed for him.

The Judge suggested that a list of
the city's boulevards be posted at the
headquarters of the Teamsters' Union
for the guidance of the members, as
there are quite a number of proscribed
avenues that are not recognized as
such by the drivers of heavy wagons,
Steiner and Baker streets being among
them.
It was on complaint of a property
owner that the teamsters were ar
rested, and they stated that no attempt
had been made to prevent their tres
pass, the policeman having waited un
til they were fairly upon the oval
driveway before he spoke to them at
alL This explanation may also have
had something to do with the dis
missal.
Four teamsters Informed Judge
Fritz that they did not Intend to fly
in the face of a special prohibitory
ordinance when they steered their ve
hicles Into the South Park Settlement,
because they were in ignorance of the
fact that Fuch a measure had ever
been enacted. His Honor accepted the
plea and dismissed the quartet, ex
plaining that he, too, was surprised
that the roadway of the once-aristo
cratic quarter was duly declared a
boulevard nine years ago and since
iien has been legally immune from
heavy traffic

If it 4 should be found possible to make

land to be takenup by the; San Fran
cisco Golf Club the British game, would
receive the greatest: impetus it has ever
had in the Pacific) States. A. good
ground with .attractive . surroundings,
where it Is ' possible T to, have a '."turfed

cricket -who do ; riot care 1 for [ the .game

ablethe directors of the golf- club,- if it
should beifound practicable, 1 would sub
let the Â¦ necessary/area to j the cricketers

Since , many of the, cricketers ; would'not

PETE TO- DAY IN ' FIELD DAY
AT . BERKELEY OVAL.
Golf Club Entertains Idea
of Making Provision for
British . National Game
Both of the newly elected track cap
tains of Stsinford University and of the
University of California will start in
the World's Fair field day this after
noon at Berkeley oval. Captain Bell
of Stanford will contest in both the
high and broad jumps and the pole
vault. It has been the custom to elect
a sprinter to take charge of the team,
but Bell was chosen on account of
personal popularity with the men and
because of his executive ability. Cap
tain Roy Hackley of the University of
California is entered in the mile run.
He- has asked the Pacific Athletic As
sociation officials to put on a special
two mile race so that he may try for
the coast record. He won the inter
collee-iate event at that distance last
week and is confidant he can lower the
mark of ten minutes ten seconds made,
by Hunter of the Olympic Club many
yt-ars ago. The request has been
granted and a two mile event has been
uddod to the programme. 1 In order
that the new record may stand, if
lowered, the association has made this
an open evtnt with entries to close nt
the track. ,
Trainer Walter Christie. of Berkeley
has been in charge of the cinder path,
for the last week and has .worked ,it
into fine shape. He reported yester
day that the recent rains had made
the course fast and it would be no
fault of the track if s'ome records
did not suffer to-day. It has been
whispered about that there is an ex
cellent chance for one of the sprinters
In the hundred-3 r ard dash to equal
Duffey's world's mark of 9 3-5 sec
onds this afternoon. Tony Cadogan is
running in grand form . and is equal
to the trick under favorable auspices
if his leg holds up under -him.' He
ran a close fourth to Duffey at Mott
Haven two years ago when that per
formance was made. Emil "Abadie
and O. F. Snedigar are also sprinting
at their best notch. It. is a tight fit
between this pair. 'as spectators niay
vouch who saw Abadie win by a cou
ple of inches in a trialbetween them.
Parsons of Southern .California, Frie
sell and Steckell of. Nevada and Cope
of Lick also have^reat' chances! in
this race, which should oe . the ; best
ever run at the distance' in California!
Never before have so many attract-'
ivc features been crowded into one
athletic event. The prospects of close
contests in every number, on the card
is bright. Tlieiritercollege, rivalry be-,
twecn Stanford and Berkeley lends ah
added charm and the light for su
premacy,against both by the Academic
Athletic League lads and Independent
athletes against both' throws a glamor
over the whole affair. . Only,: the best
men in their lines have 'sent in en
tries and the .winners will^ be entitled
to the trip planned for them, to- rep

games in St. Louis./ :

ATHLETES EAGER
FOR COMPETITION
They were won twice by the Hotch
kiss brothersâ Homer and 'Mariusâ'
but the former, is in South Africa and
no longer plays. The cups have been
won once by the following teams:
Harry Routh and Charles Dunlap,
Church and McKay, Grant Smith and
Will Allen, R. N. Whitney and J. F.
Brady, Baker brothers aiyi Brabant
and Palmer. The last named team
won the trophies last and are in pos
session of them at present.
Of these teams but one t is still in
the race. This Â¦ team is the Baker,
brothers, and the trophies will proba
bly go to them ultimately. .
Many. of the. old. teams have drop
ped out and their places have been
taken by new ones: Will Allen will
probably play with Drummond Mac-
Gavin. They played together in th^
last event of this kind, but w r ere not
successful. They, will probably allow
the Baker brothers a slight handicap.
The California Tennis Club will hold
a similar tournament one week later.
This event will be for the directors'
cups, which have been competed for
four times. They have been won by
the following teams in the order
named: Will Allen and Dr. H. P.
Hill, Grant and Chester Smith, Her
bert Schmidt* and Harry Rolfe, Will
Allen and Tracy Crawford. The two
last named teams are the only ones of
the four how playing for the cups. Dr.
Hill will in future play with Dr. Mc-
Chesney. The win of Allen and Hill
will not count for either of them.
Grant' Smith has dropped out and his
brother will join forces with Sidney
Salisbury. Young Smith has tried* his
luck with both' Mitchell arid Collier,
but these teams did not meet with
success. Smith and Salisbury should
make: a good team.
McChesney and- Hill will also be a
hard team' to -beat.
The fair, players' from the f two uni
versities caused, quite a surprise by
the excellent. tennis they played in the
second annual contest. The best play
ers in the central and northern 'part
of the State were pitted against _each
other and the tennis had more ."class
than most women's events. . Miss
Ratqliffe and Miss Edwards are proba
bly ,,f the best players, outside of /the
Southern California champions. ' De
spite this fact the inexperienced"Stan
ford girls made a good showing. They
easily held their own in the doubles
and although the scores in . singles
were one-sided, (he Stanford â¢ players
were not outclassed.
The Golden Gate Tennis Club will
hold a handicap doubles tournament
to-morrow on the park courts. It is
one of a series for the silver loving:
cups which are to be won three times
by the same team; The trophies have
been played for about r Uv6 years 'and
no team' at - present playing has won
them more than once. ' *>
A 'twenty-dog open stake was run. at
Honey Grove, Tex., on March 29. B. O.

The Hanford Coursing Club will open
its new coursing park to-morrow. The
officials have applied "to the California
Coursing'Commlttee for a license. They
have' been grantedÂ»a temporary. license
to run pending action by the commit
tee at the next meeting. R. J. Earlstou
will be manager. Many Fresno dogs
will . participate. ;.

to-morrow will be between Rubber An

and Sacramento Boy, one of the famous
greyhounds of the State. f \.
Sacramento Boy is in form at pres
ent, . as evidenced by the Impressive
manner, in which he won the .reserve
stake on the 10th inst. James Sweeney
has Rubber Ankles at her running
weight. On form she figures to lead
Sacramento Boy, but the latter is a
general favorite and will be. well sup
ported. r v\

CARDIXAL 31 EX CONFIDENT.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April
22. â A feeling of confidence prevails
among the members of the Stanford
team and among its supporters at col
lege that the baseball game to-morrow
will result in a victory for the car
dinal. The men have been practicing
faithfully since they defeated Califor
nia two weeks ago and have Improved
both in fielding and batting. In the
numerous practice games that have
been played during this time the var
sity has never failed to make a credit
able showing.
The line-up to-morrow will be the
same as in the last game with Berke
ley, which was as follows: Catcher,
Ball; pitcher. Sales; first base. Colbert;
second base, Williams; third base.
Swain; shortstop, Trowbridge; left
field, Chalmers;, center field, Wirt;
right field. Knight.
Sales has been pitching in fine form
and is expected to repeat his .work in
the last intercollegiate game. How
ever, he had a finger hurt in a prac
tice game on Thursday that may inter
fere slightly with his pitching. Tritch
will be Sales' substitute and should oc
casion call for his going intoÂ«the,box
he can be depended , upon to give a
good account of ... himself. The best
showing he has made this year wa3
in the game with the Presidio nine
last Saturday,, when he pitched gilt
edge ball, , having the soldiers com
pletely at . his. mercy. - Â«. . . .
After the game the team will go to
San Francisco to spend the evening.
A banquet will be held first in a down
town restaurant and afterward .a cap
tain for next year's team will be se
lected. Heitmuller will probably be
chosen. If he does not get the honor
Bliss will.
BERKELEY, April 22.âCalifor
nia's baseball team cannot be said jto
be in the. best shape for the final
championship game with Stanford to
morrow afternoon at Idora Park. Cap
tam Adams is suffering from a
wrenched ankle and "Ham" Hamilton
has just got out of a sick bed after a
five days' siege and things look rather
blue for the pets of the Berkeley cam
pus. It is fairly certain that Adams
will go in and hold up his end at short,
but about Hamilton there will be
doubt up to the last minute. If the
team loses either of the players it will
be badly crippled, as there are none
to take their places. In case one of
the two cannot play utility man Gunn
will be used to cover the ground.
Otherwise the team is all right and
prepared to put up a stiff battle. Heit
muller will pitch. Bliss will cateh and
the others will hold down their reg
ular places â Graham at first, Gillis at
second. Strub at third, Sweesy in cen
ter and Wulzen in right.
There was some talk of substitut
ing Strub for Heitmuller in the pitch
er's box, but the plan did not mature.
At least, it won't be done unless Heit
muller is touched up too often. In
that case Heitmuller will go to center
in place of Sweesy and Gunn will take
Strub's place at third.
The threatening condition of . the
weather makes .it probable- that the
game will be postponed. The new
grounds at Idora Park will not stand
much water and another shower such
as occurred last night will render
playing almost impossible. The col
lege men practiced on the grounds this
afternoon and they found them none
too good then.

A. M. "Cumraing and wife leave
shortly for Klamath Hot Springs for
the first of .their fishing trips of the
season.
Last Saturday, a party made up of
James P. Sweeney, Dr. A. J. Sylvester,
J. Peltier. Dr. W.' R.' Cluness Jr.,'. Dr.
George Sweeney, Dr. Wegbron Â¦ and 'J.
B. Hauer'made a firhing pilgrimage to
Carmel River near Monterey. . The
total catch was more than 200 fine
trout. They found the Carmel small
and clean. The fish , took both spoon
and fly readily. It is reported that all
the coast' streams .below Monterey,
notably .the: Big. and Little Sur, are af
fording excellent fishing.
The fishing was poor, at -Point Reyes
last Sunday. The fish seem to go in
and out on a. tide '.and the visitors
happened on a time when they were
out in the waters of Tomales" Bay.
Among the sportsmen on the- stream
from this city were: W. Barnes, J. B.'
Keriniff, Charles Breltenstein, Sam
Wells, Bert Spring, Ed Banker, Frank
Dolliver, W. A. Cooper, Dr. W. Louis
son, Al Lachman and' Ed Lynch.
Each succeeding shower of, rain
since the opening of the trout fishing
season has proved a dampener to the
hopes of the fishermen, as it has had
the effect of retarding the clearing of
the streams. The season will be un
usually late, put when vacation times
come the sport will be at its best.
There has been considerable fishing
about Santa Cruz with bait, although
all the streams are reported. high. The
prospects for. good sport later on are
better than they have been for years.
Doc Watt, who spent several days at
Boulder Creek lately, took one four
pounder. â¢ v " .
Considerable fishing is being done at
Sims and Dunsmuir on the Upper Sac
ramento. The largest flsh taken scaled
four pounds two ounces.
Sam Heller and-Achille Roos have
returned from Truckee. The river is
overflowing its banks and the fishing
is poor. Good returns are expected
about May. 1.
Each Succeeding Shower Serves ns a
Dampcner of the Hopes of
the Anglers.

The fans were breathless when St.
; Vrain threw two balls and .two strikes
; to the doctor. ThÂ«;n a fast one came
sailing over ths rubber and the medi
| cai man swung on It. But the ball
only got as far as second and Casey
quickly devoured it, putting an end to
a great game. ;
Toung Emerson, the youth from San
Jose, made his flret professional ap
pearance as a pitcher for the Oakland
team and should have won his game.
The youth made a great showing, keep
ing his hits scattered all the time and
fielding beautifully. Two of the Ta
coma runs came in on i errors by Bot
tiger and Strelb and the tnird was the
result of a home run by "Truck" Eagan
In the fourth inning. "Truck" hit
the leather over the left field fence for
the longest drive of the season.
SL Vrain, for Tacoma, pitched a won
derful game and had the Oakland play
ers completely mystified in every in?
ning but the ninth, when they made
such a noble bid for the game. He
struck out eight men In all and walked
but two. The score:

It reminded the ancient fans of the
days of the . old Haverleys yesterday
afternoc-n when Pete Lohman's Oak
land tossers began to wallop the ball
in the ninth Inning. They batted two
runs over the rubber to the tune of the
joyous yells of the multitude and then
quit. So Tacoma triumphed, 3 to 2.
But that finish was a real Garrison
boy and will be remembered, some.
With one out, Kruger hit an easy one
to Casey. He threw badly to first and
bo the runner was safe. Then Dun
leavy popped up a "Texas, Leaguer"
to center, which many went after but
no one caught. Schafly tore a torrid
bingle right past the first base line
and Kruger came romping home amid
the yells of the multitude.
Dunleavy got to third on the hit,
and when Strelb produced a long fly
to left field Dun chased over the plate.
Then Brick Devereaux responded with
a beautiful drive to right, which sent
Schafly to third. At this point the en
thusiasm of the crowd knew no bounds.
Devereaux promptly stole\ second, and
Dr. Mo-skiman, the ever reliable, who
has batted in many a run in his time,
was called in to take a crack at the ball
in place of iBottiger.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS,
. The 'fourth singles - tournament will
be started to-day. It was scheduled to
commence with" the doubles last Satur
*day,' but as many of the members were
unaware of the fact that the new green
could r be: used* they did not put: in ah
appearance."
. The new green In Golden Gate Park
was found ,ln excellent condition last
Saturday by the Scottish bowlers. It
had not been used for several months
and after the heavy rains the grass
is green and fresh and the earth firm.
Many of the players were out of prac
tice, but the weekly games will soon
put them in good shape.
Only two tournament matches were
played last Saturday, when the first
doubles tournament was commenced.
This brings play down to the first
round, in which there are sixteen
matches.
In the upper half the best matph
will be between John Reid and J. M.
Earsman and J. M. Duncan and M. L.
Crowe. - These teams are evenly match
ed, with the odds slightly In favor of
Duncan and Crowe. Another good
match in this' half will be Samuel Irv
ing and Robert Park versus J. Stotl
and J. McLaren. The latter- are con
sidered the stronger of the two, but
will have no easy time winning.
In the lower half two close games
are expected. A. Foreman and J. C.
Moffat will meet W. A. Cook and J.
W. Elder. | Moffat is the champion and
with so clever a player as' Foreman
for a partner stands probably the best
chance of winning the tournament.
Cook and Elder are a strong team and
their opponents will have to do some
clever bowling to beat them.
The last match of this round also
promises to be close and interesting.
Y. C. LawBon, one of the cleverest
bowlers in ; the city, with Alex Craig,
another expert, will try conclusions
with Dr. Hamilton and W. R. Eaton.
Hamilton ' showed great . improvement
in the last singles tournament, in which
he beat some good men..
In measuring the bowls used last
Saturday it was found that those used
by David O'Brien had two small a bias
and. were not up to the standard. For
this reason the match between O'Brien
and Joseph Gray and T. Altken and
H.. L. TIckner will have to be played
over. O'Brien was substituted for the
Rev. Mr. Guthrie. O'Brien and Gray
won the match ! la3t Saturday, but will
have a hard time doing so again, as
their opponents make a strong.team. "
The following learns will meet in the
first round:
J."-P. Taylor and ff. H. Stewart vs. AIpx
Hay and A. MrNair, John Reid â¢ and J. M.
Earsman vs. J. M. Duncan and M. L. Crowe.

Hermencta apparently sulked. Tom Slavln blew up.
Johnwm started in the first round as
though he had made up his mind to
win decisively. He was after McVey
at once with right and left to the head
and knocked the Oxnard man down
with a clean left to the Jaw. He caught
McVey coming in and slightly off his
balance. This was near the end of
.JOHNSON STAKTS \VÂ£XL.
â¢ McVey proved possessed of but one
quality necessary In th* make-up of a
; figrhtcr. He could and did take a lot of
punishment without flinching. Beyond
this he did nothing. For round after
round he did not land a blow on the
elusive Johnson, and hisÂ» mighty rlgrht
arm. with Its ridges of thews and sin
ews, might as well Lave been strapped
to his side for all the use he made of it.
McVEY CAX.VOT PUNCH.
He did not larsd an effective blow
throughout the fight, Johnson never
Riving him an opportunity to get set.
With all his strength and ruggedness,
he showed no signs of aggressiveness,
and will never make a fighter.
Johnson showed all the cleverness
for which he is noted. He landed an
incredible number of blows on Mr
* Vt-y'u head, but he never followed up
his advantage. He had his opponent
in distress several times', but he re
" fused to take a chance and backed
away out of danger. AH ?orts of re- 1

Old Injuries "by a Fail
UXC0NSGI0US FOR HOURS
The sudden end of the contest proved
a surprise. There had been but^ little
tvork done from the twelfth to the
nineteenth round. In the latter .John
!>on took a chance and staggered Me-
Vey with rights and Jefts to the head.
McVey was nearly out, the principal
damage being done him by a hard left"
to the body. When he came up for the
last round his head had hardly
cltarcii and Johnson went at him
* grain.
He landed repeatedly to thehead of
the Osnard man and then scored
quickly with a right and left to the
jaw. The 'force of the blows turned
McVey completely around and he fell
a huge, limp mass, face downward on
the raddock floor. He lay there
breathing heavily until he had been
counted out, when his seconds assisted
him to his corner.
The attendance was small, the re
ceipts of- the gallery being only *S&0.
Joe Walcott and the Dixie Kid. \v}u>
are to fight at Colma next Friday
night, were introduced by Billy Jor
dan. . ' ,
CONTEST ENDS SUDDENLY.
fcut the one that brought down the
hou&e was uttered by some one. at the
ringside, who said: "Cease this bru
tality." â¢ Ab hardly a good blow had
been striick for ton rounds humor
of the remark pleased the weary spec
tators. -M...Z " SifiX- â¢
the round. Johrjson went after him
again in the second^ round, Vehdi ng \ in
rights and lefts with- great regularity.'
McVey seemed ..tp shake up Johnson
early in the third fouhd with- a right
to the body and. then 'miased some wild
swings to the "head. . : Johnson landed
two hard rights to the body in the
fourth round. Johnson varied the fifth
round by trying fi^st for. the. head and
then for the body.' .
Johnson McVey in . the
sixth round with a right to the- head,
but the bell stopped proceedings before
; he could do % any further damage. â¢ ;
Â¦The fight showed down to a snail's
pace in the seventh and eighth rounds
and ,the crowd yelled to "throw them
out." Johnson livened things up in the
ninth round, staggering McVey with a
right to the head. Most of the fight
ing done during the evening was In
this round. Johnson wrestled McVey
down in the tenth round and kept up
his piston rod left.
Johnson was busy in the eleventh
round but ; did little damage. In the
twelfth he had McVey groggy again,
but let him come to. There was no
fighting frvm this point on to the nine
teenth and twentieth rounds. " .
In the preliminaries,. Frank Fields
stopped Arthur Williams In 'the fifth
round. Williams was knocked down
and lost track of the count, although
he was able to go on. Fred Landers
knocked out. Jack Dougherty in the
fourth round with a right to the Jaw.'
In the second round, Dougherty was
sent down for the count of seven. He
then knocked Landers down twice, both
boxers staggering about the ring in a
dazed condition. The gong'v saved;
Dougherty in the third round, but in
the fourth he retired..: . -^
Eddie Graney refere^d the main fight.*
Twenty Rcoor.ds before the close of
the twentieth round in th?ir fight In
Mechanics' Pavilion last night Jack
Johnson knocked out Sam McVey.
This brought to a c'.or-e one of the.poor
rsl lifehu* ever seer, in this city. It
n.arked the first exhibition of the
t-hujRta Club, tvhlch butted into the
boxing same hrre only to give it a de
cided wtbaek.
For a time the spectators applauded
satirically the feeble swings and Jabs
of the boxer*. Then they jvsrÂ«d the
alleged prJaciiatorp. and finally many o?
ihefn made their way out of the build
ing, leaving a small proportion of the
attendance to sit out each tirt-some
rorlr.d.

XOTES OF THE TRACK.
jBilly Cahlll's Sweet Tooth outclassed
his company^ in the six and a half
furlong run, winning without effort.
The big brown remained a 7 to 10
chance throughout the betting and led
Shell Mount and DoJKfc Welthoff past
the judges, with pounds to spare.
There was no question about stable
instructions beating Handpress for the
mile selling fixture. _ Billy Magrane's
little horse was a pronounced choice
and joe "Jones was told to wait on
Kitty Kelly the first part of the run
ning. When Jones finally did get to
work* in earnest he could not overtake
Kitty," the mare scoring by about half
a length. Mocorito, backed down from
10 to 7, ran. into the show.
--"Likewise did the next winner come
from 'the Stanfield stable. A. B. Cook,
a 15 to 1 shot, jumped away in front
at. the start of the six-furlong selling
affair and _ was never headed. Lady
Atheling, with Knapp up, closed very
strong, losing by but a neck, at odds
of*20 tb^l. .^Scherzo ran third. Sher
wood piloted the 3 to 2 favorite Ocy
rohe, and his effort was a farcical one.
Charley' McCafferty's Golden Light
upset calculations completely in the
final mile and fifty-yard event. Solon,
hammered down from threes to 6 to 5,
was supposed to be in and the smart
ones distressed themselves . getting
aboard, j The good thing led into the
stretch and was then beaten out half
a length at the wire by Golden Light,
ridden by Herbert. Hermencia seemed
to sulk. â¢
' Well, if J.' F. Sheehan didn't arouse
himself from the. lethargic state which
appears to v * almost, completely
.enveloped.hiin.for'.the past fortnight or
so;* and; pilot four' winners at Oakland

ble." O.^'hen after n short intermission
"J. F.<\ 'landed ; the mile â¢* event with
Kitty Kelly. , Next he" 'finished first
on Andrew B. Cook, ' a 15 to 1 1 shot.
Sheehan is a rider of ability If ;he
would just forget to sulk, and. now
that he has struck his gait should do
some 'good 'work' in â¢'thet saddle. "His
feat of .yesterday has not been fsur-.
passed by any rider during the season.
Again favorites made a standoff of it, 1
capturing three events. The track Was:
not fast, - , but. by this afternoon should
be in good condition. The usual crowd
was present.' ' .
Played from threes to 11 to 5 favor

show, ; three lengths before Nonie. â¢

LOS ANGELES, April 22.â The right
of the California frultraiser to route
tho shipments of his product over
whatever line of railway he may
choose waa argued pro and con by
counsel before Judge "Wellborn in the
United States District Court here to
day. The question is involved in the
settlement of the suit of the Inter
state Commerce Commission against
the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and
Pacific and Southern California Rail
way companies, brought to enforce the
order of the commission of 1902 which
gave the shipper the right of routing
his own product.
The local shippers contend that^they
havÂ«* the right to designate over*what
connecting line their shipments shall
be sent, after they reach the Eastern
terminus of the lines of the # above
named companies. The defendant com
panies deny this and assert thelr^privi
lege to route the shipment over what
ever connecting line they choose after
the shipment has been consigned to
their care.
Several arguments were made to-day
by counsel for both parties in the con
troversy, after which 'Judge Wellborn
took the matter ,under advisement.
Court Hears Arguments in
Interstate Commerce Case
and Withholds Its Decision
The Kern River field theeastern
margin of the'San; Joaquln Valley, has
a "present productive area of about
three and a half square miles.- The
wells in this field vary In depth from
600 to 1200 feet. . The oil sand "in the
center of the field,' so asserts the State
mineralogist,' is : 850 feet thick. The
great and costly pipe line,' that extends
nearly 300 miles, to deliver oil at Point
Richmond, on the bay of Sari Francisco,'
Is a striking evidence of the confidence
that the Standard Oil : Company, has In
the amount- of^ petroleum : yet to be
drawn from this great mass of oil
sand. .The extensive refining plant that
the Standard Oil Conipany . has created
at Point: Richmond," at a cost of not
less .than; $1,000,000, is another pointer
In the same direction. ,
Of the other oil fields . in . the county,
the Sunset* is in '. the southwestern sec
tion,; on the eastern' slope of the j Coast
Range ; 'the McKittrick ' is in the west
ern portion of - the county,. on~ the'oast
slope of the Coast ' Range, arid ;' about
six miles/ east from . the ':, San , , Luis
Obispo County line. The. Midway ; is ; in
the southwestern part of ..the county
also, on the eastern slope. of the 'Coast
Range. ; In these^ districts; many wells
have. been drilled; and. pipe", lines have
been established to convey : thfe product
of the dwells 'Â¦ to : the cars for, transporta

SQUARE : MILES IN OIL.
Much general knowledge has been
imparted during the lasti few years by
the daily press relative " to the oil
fields of Kern County. Their fame has,
to a lare extent, obscured the solid
merits of the other mineral sources of
wealth of Kern County. It is hardly
necessary to repeat what has been
written about the oil fields; yet a brief
statement deserves space in this con
nection. The most Important field in
California, in present production Is the
Kern River field. .What it has yielded
Is a very small part of what- it is
known to contain in petroleum. Unlike
gold, which is always sure_ of being
marketed at' a profit, allowing ; It to
have been produced at not excessive
cost, petroleum, while it has created
for itself a greater demand constantly,
has, nevertheless," beeV so necessary to
several large interests that they have
managed to depress the market rates
for their own purposes,, so that many
full wells have not been operated/ and
nothing like the possible output has
been recorded' in any year recently..
The most productive gold mine In
California south' of .the Tehachapl Pass
Is the Yellow Aster, in the Randsburg
district. This ranks with the promi
nent mines in any portion of Califor
nia. It operates 130 stamps. The
Stringer district is near the Randsburg
district. There are productive mines in
the Mojave district. Gold mining is car
ried on also at Amalie, Caliente, Keyes
ville, Woody, Isabella,' Rosamond, Hav
ilah and Kernvllle.
In minerals Kern County stands first
in California 'as a producer of petro
leum, second in the annual production
of all combined mineral products and
fifth in its ykeld of gold. Among the
minerals that it has riot yet sufficiently
exploited to figure largely In a com
mercial way are Iron, coal, lead, mica,
salt, borax, graphite, antimony, â¢ fire
clay, marble, sulphur and . building
stone.
FIRST FOR TETROLEUM.
Kern County forms the subject of a,
very interestine publication that has
Jus^ been Issued. by. the State Mineralo
gist of California. Kern County yield
ed In mineral values $3,481,926 in 1902,
as estimated by the mineralogist. Pe
troleum made a large proportional
showing In the total. The oil wells get
credit for turning out 9,777,948 barrels
of oil, which was worth at the market
rate then obtaining $1,955,585, and it
was sold for that sum presumably.
Close to the, petroleum total in value
came thÂ» gold production,' which' is
given at $1,165,982. Asphaltum was pro
duced to the Amount of 10,150^ tons and
to the value of $101,500. Lime brought
In $80,856 for 99,360 barrels; silver, $99,
135; copper, $27,122 for 235,840 pounds;
brick clays, $24,500; fullers' earth, $19,
246; gypsum, 1000 tons, $S0O0.
Only three counties In California are
larger than Kern. ( It ha3 an area of
8159 square mifes. The State Mineralo
gist attibutes to it "greater variety and
contrasts of topography, geology, cli
mate and resources than any other
county in California." Its eastern and
southern portions contain the southern
end of the Sierra Nevada Mountains
and the junction of the range with the
Coast Range at Tehachapl. Its west
ern boundary is along the summit of
the Coast Range. The southeastern
slope of the Sierras and a large portion
of the Mbjave desert are included in its
southern part. The upper end of the
San Joaquln Valley makes, up about
one-third of the total area. Trie county
Is thus seen to Include slopes of two
mountain ranges,- a large and fertile
valley plain and an arid desert region.
All these contrasting regions contain
much mineral wealth. On the Slerrah
slopes, amid forests and streams, are
important quartz mining districts. In
the valley-plain, near Bakersfield, is
the Kern County oil field, known all
over the world for its great richness in
petroleum. On the eastern slope of the
Coast Range are the Sunset and-Mc-
Kittrick oil fields, which are very pro
ductive. The foothills of both the
mountain ranges in the county abound
In minerals which are commercially
utilized. One of the prominent gold
fields of the State is at Randsburg, on
the desert. Other gold districts are de
veloping , on the desert side of the
Sierras.

Randall^ & Forden of Los Angeles
have bought the Billy Mack mine on
the Arizona side of the Colorado River,
near Empire Flats, about fifty miles
below ' the Needles. The price is *re
ported to have been 551.000.'
The Los Angeles Herald disputes the
figures given out by the California Pe
troleum Miners' Association in refer
ence to the output of certain California
oil districts last year. The Herald says
that the product of the Whittier and
Fullerton fields was underrated and
that in the Los Angeles district "the
number of Â¦ wells given is said to, be
nearly double the actual number."
The recent reports of new and im
portant gold discoveries in Trinity
County call to mind the fortune of a
former San â¢ Francisco newspaper man
In the same district. Two years ago
Hugh Hume went into Trinity County,
and after an examination of some
properties got control , of three full
claims near Carrville. The expenditure
of time, , labor and money uncovered
large mineral deposits with. free mill
ing ore of good 'value. There is . an
abundance of timber, and a . never. fall-
Ing supply of water on the claims.
More than $175,000,000 in gold have been

The Nome , News says that six
dredgers will be Installed in the Tan
ana country by the Fairbanks Gold
Mining and. Dredging Company, a cor
poration that is capitalized for $1,000,
000. The company will also operate
river steamers on the Tanana. "There
are now 2000 men in this part of the
country," says the News, "and every
day brings more travelers." Of the
six dredgers that have been ordered
in San Francisco, two will be placed
ori Fairbanks, two on Pedro and two
bn-.Cleary Creek. Mining is very ac
tive in. these localities. \ , Fairbanks
Creek has been the banner creek. for
the section since that part of the coun
try has been opened. \ The trail be
tween Fairbanks and Circle City on
the Yukon is thronged with teams
drawing large loads of supplies and
machinery. The same paper saya that
the prospects are good at Anvik, but
not much gold has yet been taken out
there.

Kern River, rising in Tulare County,
has a catchment area of 2323 square
miles. It supplies S00 miles of canals
and 3000 miles of side ditches with
water. An artesian belt twenty by
fifty miles in extent, has numerous
wells that irrigate thousands of acres.
The valley lands of Kern are made
very productive by the irrigation sys
tems. A quarter of a million acres of
rich,- alluvial lands have been formed
by the deposits from the Kern River.
There , are 2,800,000 acres of wild pas
ture land in Kern County; there are
500,000 acres that can be irrigated by
artesian wells and pumps. In the ther
mal belt are produced semi-tropical
fruits. The orchards existing are 2500
acres in extent; there" are 7000 acres
in Indian corn and sorghum. The pic
ture of this wonderful mineralized
county is amplified by the statement
that it markets pomegranates, figs,
olives, raisins, almonds, oranges, lem
ons, all sorts of berries and melons,
apricots, pears, plums, peaches, nec
tarines, apples and vegetables of every
sortâ all of its own production.
KERX RIVER'S BASIN.
industries thrive because of the
abundance of cheap fuel in easy reach.
Two trans-continental railroads pass
through Kern. There are two electric
power systems In Its boundaries, to
supply electric light, and water com
panies, factories, etc., and a plant will
furnish electric power from Kern
River to Los Angeles, More horses and
cattle are found to be shipped from
Kern County than from any other
county in the State. Kern boasts 100.
000 acres of alfalfa land and 60.000
head of cattle are imported annually
to be fattened. The county had, ac
cording to the latest returns of the
County Assessor, 100,000 head of cattle.
200,000 sheep and goats, 15,000 horses
and mules, 30,000 swine. Bakersfleld,
the county seat, has all modern im
provements and is a picturesque and
pleasing city with a great business fu
ture. I

CHICAGO, April 22.â Revision of expert re
ports maklnr wheat conditions in tha South
west more bearlrh was largely lnstrumentaljn
starting heavy liquidations of wheat to-day.
July delivery closed at a net loss of %@lc.
Corn Is off %@%c; oats are down' %(Â§'%c, and
provisions closed practically unchanged.
'For a mliVne or.t*o at the beginning of
tradlnr in ths wheat pit there was an air. of
uncertainty. In consequence transactfons were
rather light nnd prices were about where thÂ»y
left off yesterday,\w!th July %@V4c lower at
83i;c to 85V4c Suddenly th* market coMapsad
and a dtellne of lo or more was experienced
In all deliveries. Trading was active an-1
a general dlB'wsltlon to sell became manifest.
Reasons for the weakness which had thus
luiekly developed were various. A correction
of a crop expert's report on" the Western sit
uation as received yesterday and which was
exceedingly bullish larrely nullified the first
conception of tBe situation. Traders who
bought on thÂ»- suppcritlon that Western Kan
sas and Western Oklahoma were the portions
of the . Southwestern territory referred to In
the report a* being past redemption had wheat
for sale to-day. The sellers had In the mean
time ascertained that the Irredeemable portion
of the Southwestern wheat ndds was confined
to Western Texas. and Western Oklahoma. A
cable 'dispatch from Liverpool stated that mil
lers were buying considerable quantities oj
Irdlan wheat for May-June shipment at thu
equivalent Of S3e a bushel. Such a contrast
with the rrictt* at which, wheat could ; bo laid
down from here had . mtich to do with tha
heavy selling pressure. In addition there was
a large increase In, Argentina shipments. No
heed wp.s.lialU to crott Uamaj;e reports from
the Chlo .-Valley, and 'â¢ Indiana.- the 'general de

I Futures were firm in the afternoon.
The London Corn Circular says of California
Browing Barley in its issue of April 2: "Brew
ing Callfornlans point a shade easier to buy for
commoner descriptions, but the best types are
not llltely to cheapen with the evident lack of
quality arriving in new Chilean hrewlng; ship
mf-nts. On the whole the enormous Importation
of Brewing Callfornlans has \ so far arrived
fairly well up to cample, especially- the fine
anil medium qualities. Quotations run as
hcretof<ire, but there is no forcing sales en
tha part of holders. The Barley Is at reason
able value and of useful quality."

CASH WHEAT.
In this market futures followed Chicago
down, but the rash grain remained unchanged.
Futures were firmer in the afternoon.
Chicago was lc lower and fairly active, with
a kooÂ«1 deal of liquidation. Crop reports were
bullish Â¦ and indicated a' decreased acreage in
Indiana, Ohio nnd parts of Missouri by plow
ing up. Weather Indications were more fa
vorable, however. Seeding la progressing fa
vorably In the Northwist, except In the Red
River Valley, where It will be late. There Is
no Improvement In the demand .for either
Wheat or Flour. ' ' Â¦Â¦

little time start up again for the season. That

indifferent success. .
Receipts of Eggs dropped off sharply yes
teniay, the decrÂ«*a"ne from the preceding day
being 074 cases, against a gain the day before
of nearly 4U0 cases. Such fluctuations in the
daily arrivals would naturally disturb the mar

The report of Edward A. Beals. section di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
Oregon Crop Bulletin for the week ended
Ai-rll 19. is as follows:
The fore part of the wwk was eunshinv
and hoC while the latter part was ehowery
and cooler. These conditions were ideal for
advancing the growth of all crops and for the
cultivation of the soil. Fanners are still
mu.-h behind with their work and . they are
pushing their plowing and seeding as fast as
possible. Fall wheat ha.Â» a Rood stand and
that which was water soaked has refrained its
color. It has made a splendid growth during
the week. Iiarly upring needed wheat, oats,
barley and early garden truck have germin
ated nicely. Hops are making rapid advance
ment and the grower* are having dif&cufiy in
-keeping up with the work of twining and
training the vines.
Pasturage and Ftock are much improved;
rattle are picking up in flesh and the flow of
milk in the dairy districts has greatly in-
Vreased. In moÂ«t sections there Is sufficient
*rr< <-n feÂ«d for stock and they do not have
to be fed hay. Goat shearing is nearly com
pleted, and sheep (hearing Is becoming gen
eral. The K"at clip is about the average. The
lot* of lambs and roung cattle i? not t>o great
a; formerly estimated.
There Is a profusion of fruit bloom in all
sections of the State. Early cherries, apri
cots and peaches are shedding their bloom,
end It is expected that the youn* fruit will
Â«Â«t unusually thick. There have been no dam
aging froftc and the ; ru.-;Â«-tf are the best
i- Â¦ â¢ .i:> for a large crop of all kinds of
OKit.

. .' McAdie is of the opinion ; that" . the
break in ' Â¦ the . levee four miles ' below

a possible overflow. The break at T Sher

that .there have; been* several' floods in
the Sacramento River ..Valley, but much
of.' the x/ land" overflowed '? in previous
years -was' not' under, cultivation; so the
property loss was not 'so great."
Profeseor Alexander McAdie of the
Weather Bureau has Just completed his
report on the recent flood In th*e Sacra
mento River Valley. . He states that
about 2700 acres of asparagus land was
ruined and nearly 50,000 acres of wheat
land suffered great damage. Had the
storm of February 16 or those of March
10 or March 27 continued an infinitely,
greater amount of 'injury would have
been done the State, he claims. In Feb
ruary there were twenty-three rainy
days and In March twenty-six.
McAdie says the flood "demonstrated
that the : Sacramento River j system - Is
wholly inadequate for. the carrying off
of j an abnormal rainfall. | He thinks j it
easily possible for 1,812,100,000,000 cubic
feet of water. to fall In the Sacramento
district within a period of ninety days.'
In such case the \ damage | that would
likely result to property would be. al
most inestimable. ' '; .â¢ .

The decree of final distribution of
the Charles L. Fair estate was filed
for record yesterday In the Recorder's
office. The document fixes the value
of the estate after all claims have_ been
paid at $2,542,340 92. and orders the
payment of $127,117 05 as collateral
inheritance tax, but remits the penalty
of ten per cent per annum because,
owing to claims and litigation, the es
tate could not be settled at the end of
eighteen months. It is ordered -that
Interest at seven per cent per -annum
shall be paid from February 14, 1904,
amounting to $24 72 a day.

SOME HIGHLY ADMIRED SKETCHES BY PROMINENT ARTISTS THAT MAY
BE SEEN AT THE EXHIBITION WHICH IS BEING HELD AT SAN FRAN
CISCO PRESS CLUB FOR THE BENEFIT OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.
The afternoon will be made cheerful
with the music which Is appropriate
for such an artistic event, and Mrs.
Wendell Easton, Mrs. L. L. Dunbar
and Mrs. John H. Dickinson of the
Children's Hospital board are to re
ceive. A number of the distinguished
painters are expected to present them
selves. In the evening there is prom
ised an improptu concert.
The officers of the Press Club have
been and will continue to be indefati
gable In their kindly efforts to assure
the pleasure of ; patrons of the good
cause. â¢ .
Of course ex'ery charitable man and
woman of the city will be conspicuous
at the Press Club to-day, which is the
last day of the sketch exhibition for
the benefit of the Children's Hospital.
It has been a great week in the ex
clusive jinks ' room of the newspaper
fraternity and every one connected
with the laudable affair has seen to It
that everybody should be well satisfied
with the artistic arrangement of the
works of the very excellent artists.
The sketches are by some of the most
prominent men of the brush and
palette, and as there is a limit to the
price put on each canvas by which the
hospital is to be benefited connoisseurs
need have . no fear of being asked
any fancy figures.
And apart from the exhibition there
is to be a great visitation of fashion
at the club to-day, not alone from San
Francisco but from Oakland and the
other bay cities.
Except for the fact that two stables
replaced their former employes with
non-union crews there were no devel
opments yesterday in the hackmen's
strike. Fagan's stable on Sutter
street, between Montgomery and
Kcarny. was the* scene of slight dis
order, when a crowd of boys tore away
a sign bearing the Citizens' Alliance
Inscription from the hands of a man
carrying it. Later a stronger sup
porter of the banner was installed and
he performed his duties without inter
ference. Secretary James Bowland of
the Hackmen's Union made a report
to the Labor Council last nisrht, but
he refused to allow the public to learn
its nature. At his request the council
vent into executive session and noth
ing was given out regarding the pro
ceedings.

It is understood the men will vote to accept
or reject the company's proposal on Monday.
No one can eay what the result will be. While
lhÂ« company haa no plea to make. It sincerely
trusts the result will make for peace. The
company Is willing to make It* proposed con
tract run for one, two or even three years. If
that was thought preferable by the men. they
to declere their preference at once. We did
this not only to avoid theÂ«e repeated ruptures
but to demonstrate as well that we had no
desire to disrupt their organisation. The com
pany has taken no steps to Influence the men,
and It will not do so. The company hopes
that there will be a full vote, a fair count,
and that reason may prevail.
We are nw paying out an additional quar
ter of a mlUlon dollar* In wages as the price
of Industrial peace. This is a heavy addition
to cur payrolls, but we want peace â the pub
lic, tiaving a preat interest in uninterrupted
car worvice. wants peace also: and therefore it
1* encouraging to know the people indorse our
course Â«o fully.
At the carmen's headquarters there
was a small representation of the toil
ers and most of these were discreet and
thoughtful. The ballot was to be the
nieans of con%*eylng their opinions.
General Manager Chapman made a
statement last night regarding the com

"I labored with the representatives
of the company as well as I could and
secured its best terms. These I sub
mitted to the- executive committee of
the union, and their recommendation
â¢was against acceptance of the terms
offered by the company. To-morrow
night the operatives will mec< and will
be ffiven a perfectly fair explanation of
the' situation. On the following Mon

Special Officer Delmer said he was at
the corner four times during the night,
but he saw no suspicious characters
around, and he thought the Job must
have been done at 6 o'clock yesterday
morning. Fladmark told the detectives
that a strange man came Into the bar
shortly after 8 o'clock on Thursday
night and after having a drink went
to the rear. He remained there for a
few minutes and left without saying
anything. The supposition is that he
was ' Â¦ Implicated in the " burglary and
went '.to the rear t to take Â¦ in .the sur
roundings. ' . ' *
It is believed that the burglar Is "Bill
the Borer," who committed numerous
burglaries two or three years ago,* se
curing entrance to the different stores
and residences by sawing a hole in the
door near, the lock. Every effort was
made to arrest him, without success.
A saf ecracker was at â¢ work in the
Western Addition early yesterday
morning or late Tuesday night. The
police have been notified that the gro
cery of O. J. Fladmark, corner of â¢Ful
ton and Baker streets, was visited and
$161 In coin, a life Insurance policy for
$1000 and' certificates of 300 shares of
the Compressed Air Machinery Com
pany were stolen from the safe. . '
The store was closed at 9 o'clock on
Thursday night, and .wtfen Fladmark
opened It yesterday, morning some one
had been there. Entrance had been ef
fected by sawing a large hole in a panel
of the rear door close to the lock. This
enabled the burglar to unlock the door,
but he was balked by a bolt near the
bottom of the door. He forced back
the bolt. S Nv-
