Hordes of his political followers gath
ered about him and tried to cheer him.
But . the smile with which Maestretti
greeted "the gang" was evidently hard
to assume. At times it faded altogether.
At 9:15 o'clock exactly the buzzer con
nected with the jury-room burred noisily.
Maestretti started nervously, and an anx
ioiis whisper buzzed In the courtroom.
The door of the jury-room opened and
the twelve men filed Into the box.
The boss scanned their faces anxiously.
While one of the bailiffs went out to get
Judge Lawlor a painful hush reigned In
the courtroom. Maestretti lifted his hand
to his face. His arm trembled. The wait
became more painful every moment. "The
gang*' seemed almost afraid to whisper. '
Judge Lawlor arrived and took his seat.
â¢'Call the \u25a0roll."- he ordered.
"Gentlemen of the jury," asked Lawlor,
"are you agreed upon a verdict?",
"We are." replied J. H. Paige, and he
handed, a bit of paper to Clerk Martin.
Maestretti returned from his dinner
shortly after S o'clock In company with
Deputy Sheriff Jack Holland. There was
a strained, anxious look on his face. Gov
ernor Budd and Attorney Dibble tried to
offer him encouragement, but the boss'
attitude showed plainly that he could see
the shadow of the State's prison looming
up before him and that he could not help
feeling that he might be made to share
the fate of h!s associates, Wyman, Stef
fi :is and Rebstock.
Three ballots were taken, one before
they went to dinner. The first stood sev
en for acquittal and five for conviction.
The second was nine to three in favor of
clearing the accused manipulator of pri
mary elections.

nounced a scene of wild disorder en
sued. Three Deputy Sheriffs were un
able to check the outburst of Joy from
the followers of the boss.
When the cheers announcing? the
acquittal were heard la the Police Com
missioners' room an adjournment was
ordered. The Commissioners went Into
the Bate-room, where they met the boss
and congratulated aim effusively.
The case was given to the Jury at 5:55

ST. PETERSBURG. June 9.â Emperor
Nicholas has cabled the following mes
sage to Admiral Rojestvensky:
"From my heart I thank you and all
the officers of the squadron who have
henorably done their duty for your unsel
li?h work for Russia and for me. By the
Trill of the Almighty success was not
destined to frown ;-our endeavors, but
ycur boundless bravery will always be a
source of pride to the country. I wish
vcu a speedy recovery. May God console
you all. NICHOLAS."
The peculiar wording of the message
is attracting attention. The restriction
of the Emperor's thanks to those honor
ably doing their duty Is fanning the ugly
talk regarding the surrender of ships and
the conduct of some of the crews. The
rnetsacee of Admiral Enquist and Cap
tain* 'Chagln of the Russian cruiser ~AI

misbehavior on the part of officers or

Emperor has received a long telegram
from Rear Admiral Enquist, dated at
Manila, June 5. describing that portion
of the battle of the Sea of Japan on
May 27 which took place between Tsu
Island and Kotsu Island. He says the
conduct of his crew was above praise.
BOSTON, June 9.â A private cable to
a leading financial agency here states that
the plan of Japan for tbe settlement of
the war with Russia is to ' take formal
possession of Korea, make Manchuria a
buffer State and dismantle Port Arthur
and Vladivostok, making them open trade
ports for the world. This is the plan the
Japanese had before ever they started on
the war, and is what they "ipd in mind
when they commenced ten ylars ago to
reorganize their army and navy and turn
Russia back from the Pacific. This is
Japan's plan aside from the question of
indemnity, and it will not alter it in the
slightest degree.- It \e believed by finan
ciers that Japan can be induced to reduce
the amount of Indemnity. -

LONDON, June 9.â Much satisfaction is
expressed in official and diplomatic cir
cles here at the apparent success of
President Roosevelt in bringing Russia
and Japan together for the purpose of
ending the war. Since his arrival here
Whltelaw Reid, the American Embas
sador, has been in close arid frequent
communication with the Foreign Office.
The Embassador is not willing at the
present juncture to disclose the result of
his visits, but apparently he is well
pleased with the progress of the negotia
tions. The other embassies ' are without
any information. Russian official circles
now think that peace is probable, or at

meeting of representatives of the two

London Diplomatic Circles Pleaded
BBI.IEVR PEACE IS IX SIGHT.
The directors of the Equitable went, in
to session this afternoon at 3 o'clock. For
some hours prior to the board meeting,
Messrs. Depew, Belmont and Moffat, who
with Louis Fitzgerald arid J. B. Forgan
of Chicago constituted the nominating
committee, wore in seESion.
The selection of Morton, in the opinion
of those who have followed events, is in
the nature of a compromise and a' victory
for the Hyde faction. In any event, the
outcome was , seemingly a surprise to
some members of the so-called Alexander
forces. There were two sessions of the
board, a recess being taken at 5 o'clock
this evening when a committee consisting
of Senator Depew, Belmont and Moffat
was appointed to notify Morton, who had
already been elected a director. ' The com
mittee spent almost an hour looking for
Morton, who was escorted into the room
between files of expectant employes. As
the door closed behind him, the. sound of
hand-clapping was heard. The session
following the recess was comparatively
brief, the first director to leave .being
Ives, who, it has been reported about the
corridors', was a candidate for the chair
manship of the board.
Then Depew came out and gave an in
formal summary of the action of the.di
rectors. President Alexander, who was
with the Senator, acquiesced in the state
ment. It was after 6 o'clock when the di
rectors took their final adjournment. /.
Hyde proceeded to his private office,
where, after, a consultation with his law
yers, he issued a letter in which he de
clared that since the legal rights of, the
st(>ckholrlers had been determined by the
Supreme Court of the State, he had deem
cd it to be for the best. interests of the
society to part with' a.: majority, of . the.
stock in such a form that no Individual
should contest.
ASKS CLEVELAND TO ACCEPT.
He mentioned that he. would retain a
substantial stock interest, and expressed
the hope that he should continue \u25a0 to be
identified with the Equitable. . .
Following this was the tender of his
resignation as vice president. Later came
Untermeyer's statement, which follows:
. "Mr. Hyde has sold a majority of the
stock to a representative of the policy
holders represented by. Thomas F. Ryan
and of whom he is one. Mr.: Hyde retains
a substantial stock interest and will con
tinue to be identified with the company.
All the officers including Mr. Hyde have
placed their resignations in the hands of
Mr. Morton, subject to the control and
disposition of Mr. Morton. The interests
of the policy holders have been most care
fully safeguarded by. Mr. Hyde as will
be apparent from the terms of his letter
to; the board.'.' .,. .
This evening Ryan made public a letter
to Cleveland, named as one of the
trustees. Copies were also sent to Justice
O'Brien and Westlnghouse.
After reviewing Equitable affairs in the
letter Ryan asks Cleveland to accept a
place on the hoard of trustees/ saying:
"I beg you to act as an agent of this
board with other gentlemen, - who shall
be "of a character entirely satisfactory to
you. . ' - ; . :, \u25a0 .-' â¢V- :/'\. ; '\u25a0/ ,;/:
"I should not venture to ask this of you
on any personal grounds, but to restore
this great trust, affecting, so many "peo
ple of slender means, to soundness and
public confidence- would -certainly :beVa
great public service,' and this view/ em
boldens-me to make the request." ;\u25a0"" ;.'
Morton's .election/Is believed to mean
the solution ;of the controversy [ which
began between the Hyde and "Alexander
forces and \u25a0; the establishment ; of the â¢ re
forms demanded.
Interest in. the report of Superintendent
of Insurance Francis Hendricks -.will jbe
heightened \by to-day's events, "lt - having
been declared for "several I days that ; one
or more of the/ men" proposed, for 'the
chairmanship of \ the society felt con-^ j

tions have betJt confirmed. There has
be> n no undertaking on hla part to ap
pris-e Ru^!a of the Japanese terms nor,
it 5s Ixlitved, to nnd a preliminary basis
for negotiations. The main obstacle. to
the President":? efforts has been removed
at the Emperor's acquiescence in his ini
tlatlve. and negutlations are probably
now proceeding at Tokio.
When the question of the naming of
pernct pipriiputcxitiarics is raised the name
of George oe Staal, who preceded Count
Bt nkendorff iis Russian Embassador at
I^jndon and t.'ho was president of the
poace i-ontrronce at The Hague in 1599,
at once occurs to every Russian. Not
withstanding the progress already made,
a great deal of scepticism Is manifested
in certain quarters as to the result of
President Roosevelt's efforts. The pub
lic seems reluctant to believe that the
Emperor could have assented to anything
like a movement toward peace. Some
<-ynlcs even try to create the impression
that Russia only eeÂ«ks to ascertain Ja
pan's trims a:Â»d then, by flaunting the
hard conditions imposed in the faces of
the rcr- r Â«secta lives of the people when
they meet, to arouse the whole nation to
resist them. Such talk, however. Is mere
irresponsible chatter. The Emperor has
cast the die and will make peace If Ja
pan's terms be Kuth that Russia can ac
cept them with dignity.
The Emperor, it must be pointed out,
has not sued for peace. He has only as
sented to a proposition submitted by the
head of a friendly power, end the matter
officially goes no further than that Rus
â¢sla, now as ever, is ready to see if .a
common basis can be reached. The com
mencement of formal peace negotiations,
especially If coupled with the prompt an
nouncement of the convoking' of a na
tional assembly, may avert the threat
ened crisis which the liberals are forcing
wl the Government, or It may only serve
to precipitate it. Moscow is now a per
fect hotbed of protest against the exist
ing regime, and the address which the
.deputation from the Zexnstvo congress
held there has brought to St. Petersburg
to present to the Emperor has' fairly
* stunned the members of the Government.
Nothing approaching such language used
5n the document from men of such stand
ing as these who signed it has ever be
fore bet-n heard in Russia. There is a
peremptory ring about it which is omin
ous. ThoÂ«> bearing the address' came to
St. Petersburg claiming to be the pleni
potentiaries of the Russian people deliv
ering an ultimatum, not begging terms,
byt demanding rights and almost threat
ening the Government with civil war if
it does not yield. What is roo/e ominous
still is that the body which this deputa

has only adjourned awaiting the Em

-\u25a0-"Justice has been done," said Maestret
ti. "That is all I have to say n0w." ...
'Â« His rface was flushed with happiness.
For four days he. had been under a ter-
J-lble r strain. . I Three men who , had " been
associated with him in .the -work, in the
Thirty-ninth District had been sentenced
to terms In' the penitentiary. The prose
cuting | attorneys had declared that the
shadow of State's prison hung over him,
and evidently the .words struck home, p
\u25a0 The gang could not be restrained. They
pressed forward and shook his hand.

llco Commissioners' quarters, where he
was congratulated Iby fJ.V George Boyne.
The news traveled fast, and followers and
a ppolntties of Riief hurried to the hall to
express ; their Joy. ;/

charged was : attempting to , Induce C.: M.

MAKER OF BAD COINS
GIVES HIMSELF UP
- On the very night of the murder and
immediately after the dark deed had been
finished Mason mounted a horse and came
to Stockton in order to prove an alibi.
He returned to attend the inquest, where
he gave evidence to show that he was not
present and thus screened his wife from
suspicion. The couple remained at their
home for about .three months, when they
removed to Stockton. *
Mason Â«was taken into custody yester
day afternoon quietly, and the officers
waited for the return of Mrs. Mason from
Los Banos, to which place she had been
suddenly summoned by the death of a
sister. This afternoon she was arrested
a few minutes after she left- the train.
Sheriff Graves of Calaveras, who came
here to .work on the case, will take the
couple to Calaveras trial.
The girl told the Sheriff that her father
and mother had trouble with Nandlno be
cause their hogs invaded the premises
which Nandlno had been left to guard.
One night they heard the dogs barking,
and knowing that the hogs were intruding
again on their neighbor's land Mason
armed himself with a revolver 'and, ac
companied by his wife, went out and con
cealed himself behind some trees. Nandl
no came around the corner of the house.
There was a shot and Nandlno fell dead.
Then' Mason and his wife dragged the
body into the house, poured oil over it
from a lamp and set it afire, thinking that
the whole house would burn.
Suspicion that the Masons were guilty
of the Calaveras crime had been enter
tained by Sheriff Sibley for some- time,
and "it 'occurred to him that if he could get
the custody of the 15-year-old daughter, of
the Masons and remove her from control
of her parents he could awe her into tell
ing something of the death of Nandlno.
Last Wednesday the girl was quietly
taken into custody. She was concealed
and In a few hours she had told the of
ficers enough to justify the arrest of her
parents.

about the matter and Stanton ; replied
that he did not know, that it was up
to him (Clark).
It has been learned that Stanton left
the city ; yesterday with William Mal
lagh. County Tax Collector and- his
legal adviser, going in a buggy to Edna

building and loan association and
other sums amounting to fully $1200.

his possession.
This* morning Stanton appeared, in
court, waived a hearing and was placed
under $5000 bonds. John W. ; Barnberg
and L.~ F. Sinstieimer of this rity'are
his sureties. It": is said Stanton with
held money he collected on lumber bills.
The shortages were detected when Au
ditor Huntley sent out verification no
tices to the company's debtors.
Stanton has been in the office in his
late capacity for the last ten years and
has always been a, most faithful and
hard working employe;- handling- the
business,' the dispatching of trains on
the company's railroad as well as the
lumber; business, working early, and
late as required. ''He has been remark
ably successful In his : work. '.No sus

"Lust Wednesday we packed our pos
sessions and parted. We said good
by and I wished her good fortune and
joy forever. Now I am arrested, charged
with abandoning and not supporting a
wife I had merely permitted to leave
me when she showed that she wanted
to leave."
"That news shocked me greatly, for I
was not aware that Mary had another
sweetheart or I should not have taken
her from him. My heart was touched
by the sincere sorrow of Mary for her
jilting of the other man. so I proposed
that we separate, she to go back to her
first love. I to go on as before I met
her. She at last consented to this
plan â for she realized that with me
there could never be real happiness for
cither of us with the shadow of that
insane sweetheart always before both
our minds.
"X answered that little advertise
ment," said Lowney, "and after a short
courtship we were married. That was
on May 25. A few days after the wed
ding my wife told me with tears In her
eyes of an old sweetheart, who went
insane when he heard the news of her
marriage to me.
ST. LOUIS, June 9. â After magnani
mously giving up his wife so that she
might return to an old sweetheart,
Frederick C. Lowney of East St. Louis,
formerly of Tulare, Cal., was astonished
to find himself charged with wife
abandonment and indignantly surprised
when he was locked up for the offense.
It was from a paper devoted to matri
monial exchange correspondence that
Lowney says he collected the descrip
tion of a grirl he thought would suit
him as a partner for life.

SCOTT'S WORK
APPRECIATED
The Pinkerton men advised Miss
Cunningham to leave Smith, and she
went to an uptown boarding-house to
remain until her return to the north.
Smith disappeared, and it is presumed
that he returned to Portland. On June
2 the Chief of Police of Portland sent
a request to Chief Dinan to arrest Miss
Cunningham, and she was later taken
into custody and detained until Friday
in the matron's ward at the Hall of
Justice. Chief Dlnan shared the opin
ion of the Pinkerton men as regards
Miss Cunningham's innocence and on
Friday he had her put aboard a north
bound train, after receiving her pledge
that she would not remain In Portland,
but would proceed direct to her home
in Pendleton. Before leaving, the un
fortunate woman confessed to the of
ficers that she would soon become a
mother and admitted that Smith had
betrayed her.
When first arrested Miss Cunning
ham told the officers that she was on
her way to Notre Dame Convent in San
Jose, when she met Smith in Portland
and at his request she waited over a

BERKELEY, June 9.â Professor Robert
Dupouey has resigned from the faculty
of the University of California that he
may complete the work of writing . three
volumes dealing with American univer
sity life and other American subjects.
The French Government, which sent Pro
fessor Dupouey to this country: for- the
purpose of gathering data on the subjects
mentioned, will publish the books. ,
The generosity of James H. Hyde,
whose official connection with the Equita
ble Life Assurance - Society of New
York has been exploited at. length of
late, made possible the tour of Professor
Dupouey in America, the insurance mil
lionaire co-operating with the French
Government In the project of sending a
French scholar to this country who
should study university life here and em
body, the results of his observations In a
volume which' might be used as an au
thority in French institutions.
The French Government provided a
fellowship at Harvard for Professor Du
pouey. who despite his youth (he is now
28 years old) was rated as one of the
most brilliant \u25a0 scholars and students in
the French schools. Professor Dupouey's.
familiarity with English, which houses
with the fluency and precision of an
American born, served as a factor in in
fluencing the Government to send him
abroad for official purposes. :
James Hyde, who .provided for the
Hyde course of . lectures ; in the Univer
sity of California and in other American
universities, extends his interest in
French matters to the Bending of Ameri
can scholars to France,' there to lecture
in French schools upon American topics.
Professor Dupouey enjoys a personal ac
quaintance with the insurance magnate
and predicts that , Hyde "will triumph
eventually ip the war between rival fprces
of finance being waged in Wall street, j
â¢ M. Dupouey. has been at the-University
of California for a year. He has, had op
portunities for studying American uni
versity life, both in the Eastand in the
West.' He - has delivered â¢ severar courses
of lectures here In French, dealing with
such subjects as '.'The Frenchwoman -In
Contemporary Novels" and others relat
ing to political ,-antl -social,, affairs In

BURLINGAME, June 9.â The School
Trustees have finally: selected what they
are convinced are the most artistic plans
for ? the new public school building which
is to grace, this district! "The plans select
ed provide for. a ' building of . the ; mission
type- The, new., school, .will consist of
eight large classrooms and an assembly
hall. It is estimated that the cost will be
at .: least $21,000. .TV '
...Two admirable sites have been offered
to. the trustees, but no selection. has .yet
been made.. One of. these sites' is a four
acre tract, which can be had for $14,000.
Another site, also under - consideration
contains a little more than two acres, for
a price not, to v exceed $6500. Both pieces
of ground .are ..well adapted for school
purposes. As soon as the site is chosen
bids will , be asked for and construction
will be ordered without delay.
REDWOOD CITY. June 9.â lt Is defi
nitely: understood here that "James D.
Phelan, George A. Knight and Joseph. S.
Tobin of San Francisco are heavy stock
holders in the Ocean Shore Railroad and
are greatly Interested In pushing tbe
electric railway to an early completion.
These capitalists have recently been fre
quent visitors to the Half moon Bay dis
trict, and Knight has invested largely in
land in that part of San Alateo County:
That men of such substantial means
and recognized energy are behind the en
terprise gives renewed confidence in the
promise that within fifteen months San
Francisco } and Santa Cruz will be con
nected by an electric nne.
It is claimed by the promoters of the
road that the Journey, from the metropo
lis to the seaside city. will be made in two
hours, notwithstanding the fact that tha
distance as snrveyed ; is eighty-three
miles. Great electric locomotives, which,
have been so successful In Eastern com
munities, will be employed. The use of
such motive power is considered an im
provement upon the third rail system.
The element of danger, it is claimed, is
also greatly reduced by them. . .-.-
It Is promised that work upon both ter
minals of the railroad will be commenced
within a month. More than $400,000 has
been set aside by the corporation for the
purchase of rights of way, and every
thing necessary in this regard has al
ready been secured. Two substantial
power-houses will be bunt, and it is like
ly that Halfmoon Bay will furnish the
site for one of them. The Santa Cruz
terminal of the railroad will be near the
Sea Beach Hotel. The San Francisco
terminus will be near thÂ« China Basin on
property owned by tue Santa Fe Railroad
Company.

"the late Dr. Dean was sued for,; mal

died in 1891. The estate has never been
probated. Sullivan came into court - this
morning representing the widow of, the
elder Dean and asked that all of the real
property be homesteaded and the widow
allowed a family allowance of $75 a month
from, the time of her husband's death.

man, who is under sentence of death for
his part 'ln. the crime, took the stand to
day at the trial of Mrs. Aggie Myers and
told the part both he and the woman
played â¢in the , murder of her husband,
Clarence Myers. When Hottman faced
the prisoner to-day it was the first time
their eyes had met since the couple were
arrested a year ago.- Each stared at the
other unmoved. . .
Hottman told of his planning, with Mrs.
Myers to kill Myers that- they might
marry. Mrs. Myers, he declared, had re
fused toelope with him, saying, "She
had to get rid of him."
"She told me," Bald Hottman, "of a
friend of; hers who had a husband she
wanted'.tq'get rid of, and while he was
sick .with", typhoid fever she gave him
some poison in his medicine and killed
him." ' ' :" " â¢\u25a0 \u25a0
| Hottman said that he at first refused to
kill Myers, ; but â¢ consented finally after
Mrs. Myers' had repeatedly Insisted. They
planned the murder minutely, and on the
fatal night Hottman went to the Myers
house and was met by Mrs. Myers.- Myers
was awake- and the woman gave him
something to put him asleep. After Myers
had gone to sleep Hottman struck him on
the head with a billiard cue. Myers arose,
called to his wife for help, and the men
began a death struggle.
"While we were struggling." continued
Hottman, "she got a bed slat and struck
Myers. .with it. Then she went back into
the bedroom . and came out with a razor
and cut his throat. I let him down to the
floor and she leaned over him and cut his
throat "again several times." .
I While Hottman was telling .this story
Mrs. Myers sat unmoved watching the
witness. Hottman told of Mrs. Myers aid
ing him to get rid of the bloodstains, and
of her giving him money to flee from the
city. / *?jV ." ~
\u0084 CHICAGO, June 9. â The National Wfcotesale
Liquor Dealers' . Association of America se
lected Louisville as the place of the next
meeting. A resolution was adopted condemn
ing any law which discriminates against
blended whisky In favor ot what Is â¢ com
mercially . known as straight.
: ! The garment-workers, the original cause
of the \u25a0; present strike, have come, to the
conclusion- that the : teamsters have " for
gotten the "sympathy" which two months
ago prompted them to ; strike In aid of
the tailors. ; At a meeting of all the spe
cial order locals the following resolution
was adopted: |
"Resolved, â¢ That In the event of the
Teamsters' Union calling- off their strike
it Ibe : the sense of the organization that
such . action shall not terminate in any
way/the struggle which the garment
workers are carrying on' against the Na
tional Wholesale Tailors' Association un
less the teamsters' settlement carries
with It a satisfactory . settlement of the
garment-workers' question."
.1 Warlike reports continue to come from
the team owners, but W. . P. Rend Is al
mosti the only ; employer In the associa
tion ; who Ms definitely known to be dis
posed -to i break - the period of neutrality
and "go Â§ It : : alone." . To-morrow evening
the Team ". Owners' Association intends to
meet' to discuss fully every phase of the
situation. : T
The; chief effort toward a settlement
was ; made by a committee of the team
sters, which attempted to open separate
negotiations with the large State | street
department stores. .;. Every effort' of the
strikers in this j direction has - heretofore
produced no result whatever, and the
move of to-day met with the same fate
as did its predecessors.
Disappointed by a sudden turn of affairs
that resulted in President .Shea .being
subpenaed \ to Wheaton,' 111., to-day, lead
ers in the teamsters' strike paused some
what In forcing ; definite peace -moves.
They feared some sort of a trick in . the
unexpected demand upon the chief execu
tive* of. the ; Brotherhood of , Teamsters.
â¢Shea had just reiterated his, belief, that a
conference . of strike leaders and employ
ers ; might -be brought about with bright
chances for a settlement If both himself
and 'Attorney ' Ijevy Mayer, counsel for
the 'employers, were not. included in the
make-up of the j conference. ' While still
talking,*: Shea was ' served with ' a legal
paper, demanding his presence in a court
In the neighboring county. The summons
had no connection with the strike.
CHICAGO, June 9.â Aside from onÂ» or
two feeble efforts to ; open peace negotia
tions, \u25a0 there were : no developments to-day
in the teamsters' strike. The attempts at
peace failed utterly^; -P *

CHRISTIANIA, June 9.â The Nor

over the Akershus Fort and throughout
the country in place of the union flag.
The substitution was attended with
great ceremony at the fort, where the
members of the Storthing: and 30,000
people were assembled.' The garrison
was paraded in front of the quarters
of the commandant of the fort and the
commandant read the resolution of the
Storthing dissolving the union with
Sweden.
As the clock in the tower of the fort
chimed 10, the union flag, which had
floated there since 1814, was hauled
down, the troops . presented arms, the
band* played the patriotic air, "Sons of
Norway," and after only a momentary
interim the first gun of a national
salute boomed, \u25a0 the new flag was
hoisted and the troops again presented
arms. The people then uncovered and
cheered wildly, the band adding to the
general enthusiasm by playingr ' the
popular air, "Yes, We Love This Coun
try." First one, then another, took up
the words of the song until, the whole
crowd joined. Then round after round
of cheering greeted the flag. Three
cheers â¢were next given for the father
land and the singing- of the national
anthem concluded the ceremony.
Baron yon Wedel-Jarlsberg. who has
been the Minister of Norway and

"By this revolutionary proceeding," said
the Premier, "the Storthing has, not only
without the co-operation of the King, but
without the least consideration of Sweden
and on its own authority, . determined
upon the rupture of the union which ex
isted by virtue of a mutual convention
drawn up in accordance with the laws
and which can in no way be broken with
out the assent of the two countries. In
asmuch as the tesdlutlon of the Storthing
Is a great and profound violation of the
rights of Sweden, it is indisputably neces
sary that the Riksdag be summoned sin
extraordinary session without delay" ' to
deliberate on the measures to be taken
by Sweden in view of what has passed."
The resignation .of the Ministers \u25a0of
Sweden and Norway at â¢\u25a0 Copenhagen,
Rome and Madrid were tendered by tele
graph and accepted.
King Oscar is quoted as saying that he
would avoid war at any cost. Officials
here say that the King and Crown Prince
had been fully prepared for the action
of the Storthing by Premier Michelsen,
who informed them prior to his Majesty's
veto of the Consular bul as to the steps
Norway intended to take.
STOCKHOLM, June 9.â Crown Prince
Gustave. on his return from. Berlin to

Kins Oscar decided at a meeting of
the Council of State to-day- to summon
the Riksdag; for an extraordinary ses
sion on June 30. The Crown Prince
was present at the sitting, which had
before It the resolution of the Norwe
gian Storthing, which the Premier de
nounces as revolutionary.
According to well-informed persons here
Russia and Germany will refuse to recog
nize the Norwegian Government until
King Oscar consents to the disruption
of the union. Strong efforts are being
made to secure similar action by other
Governments, including that of Denmark,
and It is said that these efforts are meet
ing with encouragement.
The Norwegian press and people, ac
cording to advices received here, remain
singularly undemonstrative. Premier
Michelsen wants no demonstration and
to-day refused to permit a large proces
sion of Christlanians in approval of the
action of the Storthing. In refusing, the
Premier said: "It Is too early to claim a
victory which has not yet been definitely
gained. Our most serious difficulties are
probably ahead."
Thousands of telegrams from all parts
of the world are pouring in on Premier
Micbelsen and the Storthing, many of

"The Jury might well find upon the evi
dence that the death was not the result
of natural causes and that it was due to
some criminal agency. They could well
conclude that the autopsy disclosed no
natural cause for the death and that in
the light cf the medical opinions It could
only be accounted for as having hap
pened in the way testified to by Jones;
that is, by chloroform poisoning, admin
istered while the \-lctim was sleeping.
The physicians who assisted at the
autopsy testified to physical conditions
making a natural death incredible. It
was for the Jury to say whether the
facts and their opinions, with that of Pro
fessor \Tltthaus, satisfactorily accounted
for a death by cnloroform poisoning.
"The finding of mercury in the body
corroborated Jones' story as to his hav
ing given mercurial poison to the de
ceased to weaken his system."
The defense is based upon a denial that
Rices death was effected by violent
means or that it was caused by the de
fendant and the proposition is advanced
that the forgeries were not brought home
to the defendant or, if the evidence war
ranted the finding that they were, that
that fact did not necessarily fasten upon
him a criminal agency in the murder.
It was not claimed that Patrick per
sonally committed the murder, for the
prosecution had the voluntary confession
of Jones that it was be who did it, in
duced and aided thereto by Patrick, but
the defendant was a principal in the com
mission of the crime under the law If he
aided and abetted it, whether present or
absent, or if he, directly or Indirectly,
"counseled, commanded, induced or pro
cured" another to commit it. After are
view cf the evidence the opinion con
tinues:
Judge Gray sets forth that the theory
of the people was that the defendant had
conspired with Charles F. Jones, the
valet, or as sometimes called, the secre
tary of Rice, to kill Rice and that the
defendant also secured Jones to admin
ister chloroform to him while he was
asleep, in the accomplishment of their
Joint purpose. This purpose, they say,
was the desire to obtain possession of
Rice's estate through a will in favor of
the defendant and through various trans
fers to him of properties all purporting
to have been executed by Rice, but which
had In fact been forged by the defendant
with Jones" aid.
On April 7. 19C2. Patrick was convicted
on an indictment charging him with the
murder of Rice by chloroform and mer
cury administered to him during his sick
ness oa September 23. 1900. The case
reached the Court of Appeals on March
14 of this year when David B. Hlll,<who
appeared for the appellant, based bis
argument for a reversal mainly on the
contention that the condition of Rice's
body, revealed by the postmortem exami
nation, might have been caused by fluids
used in embalming.
The prevailing opinion Is by Judge
Grey, with whom Judges Bartlett, Haight
and Warner concur. There is a dissent-
Ing opinion by Judge O'Brien. Chief Judge
Cullen and Judge Vann concurring. Chief
Judge Cullen also filed a memorandum.
Patrick has succeeded in postponing the
ultimate decision of his fate for over three
years by a display of acumen and re
sourcefulness that has excited the wonder
of the members of the bar and the public
at large. The opinion of the court,.writ
ten by Judge Gray, is very exhaustive,
reviewing the formidable record in every
detail and containing upwards of 16,000
words. v

from statehood to be a "reflection on the
good faith and patriotism, of the Nation
al Government."
It was also resolved that Oklahoma
and Indian Territory should be disasso
ciated ,In consideration from "other en
tangling alliances.".
This refers to the connection with Ari

sidered at the next session of Congress.
Resolutions were also passed declaring
against the proposed general strike of the
International Typographical Union *on
January 1, 1906, on account of its de
mand for an eight-hour day with nine
hours' wages. This action If carried out.
the resolutions asserted, would be "revo
lutionary and demoralizing in Its effect
on business conditions." The United
Typothetae9 of America were commended
for the stand they have taken In favor of
maintaining harmonious relations be
tween employer and employe and against
combinations and conspiracy.
The election of officers resulted. In thÂ»

The prospect for the game of lacrosse
Is not bright just now. Up to the present
time it has been found impossible to har
monize the factions In San Mateo and to
organize a team there, though many good
players live in oK near the town. Of the
four clubsâ the San Francisco, the Olym
pic, the San Mateo and Talagooâ which
formed the California Lacrosse Associa
tion at the beginning of the season only
the two first named remain. An attempt
wÂ»s to have been made last week to re
organize the Talagoos and create a third
club to contend for the championship of
the association, but none of the executive
comraltteemen reached San Mateo on. the
evening appointed, and consequently
nothing was accomplished.
So far as can be seen at present the se
ries of matches for j the 1933 championship
of the association will reduce- Itself to a
duÂ«l between the San Francisco and
Olympic teams. Great rivalry "exists be
tween these clubs, each being eager for
the honor of playing against the Sham
rocks of Montreal or the Capitals of Ot
tawa, whichever, of these two '-â crack
Canadian teams visits San Francisco this
jear. Both teams have arranged to , play
a. series of matches on 7 the' Pacific Coast,
and It Is probable ' both will visit San
Francisco.

She took a number of prizes at the
Bulldog Show in England "and -at
Streatham and Sandy." At one show she
was awarded the. special for the. best
bodied tiog in the show, beating - ai
other breeds In this competition. She
is in whelp to Lord Burley* which has
beaten every dog-, in England. Included
In his list of victories is one. over the
dog for which George Gould pain $5000.
the coast has just been made by Fred
J. Rodger?, who arrived from England
pome days since with the bulldog, Girt
ford Goody, noted for her great physi
cal beauty â as beauty goes in that
breed. While she touches a high stand
ard in all that g-oes to make up a per
fect bulldog, she is particularly strong
In the body. She is pronounced the
beat bodied of- the breed > alive. In
breadth of chest she almost, rivals Tom
Sharkey, the fighter.*.
Glrtford Goody is by Champion Ivcl
Doctor, out of Ivel Dorry. In color she,
is white, â¢ with brindle-marked head.
She .weighs fortj'-five pounds. H. St,
John Cooper, an authority on tho breed,
In his latest book, whicft describes the
best twenty of the breed, says of her:
"She is probably the best bodied of her
sex alive. In fact it would be dif-.
ficult to find fault with her body, while
in skull and underjaw there is little to
be desired." â¢ .
Entries for the breeders' meeting at
Fresno will close Thursday next, the
15t!i inst. Ten thousand dollars is of
fered in purxes for trotters and pacers,
the; largest stake being $1500 for trot
ters of the 2:24 class. The track at
Fresno is one of the best and fastest
in the State and is in almost perfect
shape for record breaking. The citi
zens of Fresno raised a bonus of $1500
to Induce the breeders to hold their
mooting at the raisin center.
Denver's big meeting opens next Tatur
Â«Jay. Tr.e runners will occup;"-the prin
cii al portion of the daily programme, but
tht-re are two harness events each day
and many fa^t trotters and pacers will
rsc<- there. .Word comes from there that
Bon Voyage. W. A. Clark Jr/s tbree
yeisr-Gl<l trotter, is showing two-minute
Â«rÂ«eJ and looking lilce a champion. Mr.
Clark bought lion Voyage for JIO.OW just
after the co.lt had won the two-year-old
division of the Kentucky Futurity last
year and taken a record of 2:15. Bon
Vo'yige started three times in his' two
year-old form.. First In the Horse Review
Etakc at Cincinnati, which he won in
straight heate in 2:17^ and 2:15*4. beating
The Phantom (which James Butler after
ward bought), and five others; next in
the Kentucky Futurity, where he beat
Katherine L and seven others in straight
hats in 2:15 and 2:15%, and the third
time, a week later, when Jack Axworthy
beat him in straight heats in 2:15% and
2:lÂ«*i. Charles Marvin, the veteran reins
dan that was formerly at Palo Alto,
bred, trained and drove the colt to his
record and believes he should beta great
three-year-old. When Bon Voyage was
working, at Los Angeles this spring he
-was not the best Raited colt In the world,
but improved greatly beiore leaving for
Denver, and it is now reported that he is
trotticg like a winner for Ted Hayes. On
Wednesday of last week Mr. Hayes drove
him the last . quarter oÂ£ a slow mile in
thirty seconds flat by his own watch,
while such experienced timers as Joe
Gavin and Joe Matty caught the quarter
In 23Â»i seconds. Bon Voyage is well
staked and will make his first start in
the Hartford Futurity, then in the Horse
KeviÂ«w Stake, at Cincinnati, and the
Kentucky Futurity at Lexington.
The recent sale of trotters held in
Boston by the Fasig-Tlpton Company
was not encouraging: to breeders who
snip horses to the Eastern markets.
Those sold did not bring: any higher
prices than would have been paid for
them here In California. Two McKln
nÂ»Â»y fillies taken to the sale by James
Thompson of Pleasanton brought but
$550 and $325, which is no more than
could. have been obtained for them
here, without the expense of. transpor
tation to Boston, which is quite a sum.
Horse values are as good in California
as anywhere else in the United States
at the present time, with the possible
exception of high-class racing pros
pects, and Eastern buyers are perfect
ly willing to buy any real prospect
here, trusting to experts of their own
choosing to report on the horses, -v y
T. J. Crowley of this city, who Is one
of the directors of the Trottfng-Horse
Breeders* Association, is out with an
offer to renew the Crowley stake, which
tra* inaugurated last year. This Is a
tide stake of $25 each for colts and
fillies that start In the Breeders' Fu
turity. Last year's Crowley stake had
a value of $675. and it is thought the
one of this year will reach $1000.
A new feature of the programme will
be two selling races, one for trotters
and one for pacers. Xothing of the
kind has ever been tried before on a
trotting track, although the Breeders*
Association has put a race of this char
acter on its Fresno programme. In
these races, which are for $500 purses,
horses are entered to be sold for $200.
The winner is put up at auction and
all over the entered price is equally di
vided between the association and the
owner of the second horse. Any horse
in the race may \>e claimed for $200
plus \u25a0 the amount of second . money.
Should the winner be sold his owner
will receive first money, which is $250,
and $200. the -selling price, making:
ST..-.M in all. It is thought these selling
races will grive owners of the slower
horses an opportunity to race them
\u25a0without being compelled to meet the
fast green ones that are worth up in
the thousands, although without rec
ords.
The trotting: classes are. free-for-all,
J809; 2:12 class, $700; 2:IS class, $700;
2:18 class. J600; 2:24 class, $1500; 2:30
class, $660. For the pacing horses are
the free-for-all, $860; 2:09 class, JSOO;
2:13 class, $600; 2:18 class. $600; 2:20
class, $600; 2.-25 class, $1500. There are
also three big trotting stakes for
three-year-olds â the Occident, Stanford
and Stallion stakes, worth from $1200
to $3000 each. â¢
Xearly $20,000 will be distributed
among the winners at this meeting.
Entries for these races will close July
10.
The programme of harness racing
which Secretary Albert Lindley of the
California State Agricultural Saciety
has announced for the State Fair in
September provides for clx days' rac
ing-, with three harness events each
day. \u25a0
The regatta: committee having Â«the v race
In charge announces that' the steamer H.
J. Corcoran has-been engaged to carry
spectators' and will be at the foot of
Powell-street wharf at 12:30 p. m. on the
day "of the race. The preparatory signal
for the racing yachts will be given at 1:25
p. m.- and N the starting signal -at 1:30 p.
m., the yachts being allowed two minutes
within which to get across the line with
out penalty. The steamer, H. J. Corcoran
will be for spectators and will follow the
racing- yachts -closely ; so- that those on
board may get a full view of all the de
tails of. the contest. The judges, 'timers
and other officials will be on board an
other f craft,: as it will be necessary for.
them to be at the finishing line in sea

â¢ The grammar school tournament was
originally set for the l.th test., but has
been postponed to the 21th- Many of the
juveniles are entered and as their June
tournament will be played next Saturday
a postponement of the grammar school
championship was necessitated. Already
six schools have entered players, and
many more will do so. next week. This
event will doubtless prove -Interesting, as
many of the boys entered are quite skill
ful with the racket. M. McLoughlln. the
Junior- Club champion, is expected to
carry .^oJt .the honors.
, : The fifth . annual tournament for the
championship of the State will be played
on" the San -RafaeT courts on July 4. The
tournament , win probably commence on
the Ist" 6f July. Champion MacGavin will
not be here to defend it and the event has
an open look. All of the cracks who
competed in the San Francisco champion
ship tournament and several who did not
will be in the competition. Many think
Carl Gardener will annex the champion
ship, but he will have a much harder tlma
than he did in the tournament completed
last Sunday. George Baker and George
Janes are fully as clever as Gardener and
Percy - Murdock will play a much better
game than he did last .Sunday. He,win
be in better form next . month and if \u25a0b9
decides to play should carry off the hon
ors. He was -bothered considerably last
Sunday by the wind. Gardener plays a
great up-hill game and is improving: all
the time. He will be a bard man to beat
from now on.'
Clarence Griflln. a year cr. two Â«go,
one of the most promising young players
in the city, will have a try at tee cham
pionship this year. Griffin has gone back
considerably of late, but it has been due
principally to a lack or training and
practice.
George Janes, who has-been taking an
enforced rest of several weeks, will be a
prominent candidate In the coming tour
ney. WBm â¢ \u25a0-
Many tennis tournaments are scheduled
for the month of Jane and the cracks
should all be in good form, for the State
championship tournament to be played
at San Rafael early, next month. The
public court players. have had a lonff rest
from, tournament play, but from now on
there will be a tournament almost every
Sunday. The third and fourth class play
ers started the ball rolling last Sunday
and the first and second class experts
will have, an innlny to-morrow. : ;
Owing to the unusually small entry;; list
in the first and second classes lt.was.de
cided to combine the two divisions,; This
might seem unfair to. the â¢ second., class
men, but there are several of them who
are by no means outclassed by those hi
the first class. A new. cup has been put
up for-the competition to-morrow.-. .Like
the one won by George Baker, it will be
a three-time trophy. The best of the
players at the park entered the tourney
and there will undoubtedly, be som* in
teresting tennis. Carl Gardner, who .won
the San ' Francisco championship last
Sunday, did not affix his signature to.
the entry list, nor did George Janes.; an
other clever player. Gardner's failure to
enter is quite a disappointment, as. the
enthusiasts were anxious to have hint try
conclusions with George Baker. The lat
ter is expected to win to-morroWs event.
but he will have no easy time doing so.
The finals of the third and fourth class
\u25a0 tournaments commenced last Sunday
will be played to-morrow. In the third
class G. Guerin and G. Hall will fight it
out. while in the fourth class the con
testants will be W. Howell and M. Cricb
ton. Guerin and Hall bare met several
times and the honors are about even.
Many of those who watched the play last
Sunday pick Howell to beat Crichton.
but. the latter may spring a surprise.
Other tournaments set for this month
are the first annual singles for the gram
mar school . championship, a handicap
doubles for the Olds Cups, a tournament
for the Juveniles and a handicap doubles
on the California Club courts.

basket ball, match this morning on the
courts- of the former school. The game
will be closely contested from start to
finish, as the athletic misses hold the
same rivalry toward each other as the
boys in their lines.
Both squads have done considerable
practicing and are considered fairly
good players. The girls v of the black
and gold seem to have a slight advan
tage over their opponents, as they are
accustomed to their court.
The Lick team has done well- this
season. In the. game with the .Com
mercial High School girls on Thursday
the last named wen by a score or 8 to 6.'

HUGH McGOWAN RUNS
A FAST MILE RACE
â¢ The fair golfing maids who saw with
mingled pleasure and regret the beauti
ful Poniatowskl cup withdrawn from
competition when Miss Florence Whittell
won it in honora./.e play on the links of
the Burlingame Country Club last July
can take heart, as an equally artistic
trophy has been provided to take its
place.
Mrs. William H. Crocker is the gener
ous patron of the pastime to come for
ward with a trophy, designed by Shreve
& Co., which will permit of the competi
tion commenced in 1899 being carried on
without interruption. As in the past, the
riew cup will be played for annually on
July 4 until won twice by the same play
er, when it becomes her property. The
name of the winner in each annual match
trill be inscribed upon the cup, thus add
ing to its intrinsic value. The competi
tion is open to all women members of
Eolf clubs in the United States. It will be
decided under match play conditions.
As a companion cup to that offered by
Mrs. Crocker, Charles W. Clark, who
has proved a liberal patron of all the
high class sports of the field, has offered
one for competition among the men. This
is open to members and juniors of all
golf clubs In California, It will be played
for at Burllngame at the same ' time as
the Crocker cup, but under medal play
conditions.

and Wheeler, tore past third. and. -was
about totryfpr the plate when Francks
picked up the" ball with one mitt and ran
down the" astonished Wheeler, who stood
looking on instead of running some place.
" Uncle's brigade started out in the. ninth
with lots^of action. Kelly booted Spen
cer's grounder and. Streib dropped Dever
eaux's throw of Waldron's bunt." Wheeler
laid down another 'Â» of the same kind and
Streib, booted this, leaving 5 a full 1 house.
It was. good-night; when Hildebrand,
slapped one far-, out' into the .' right /gar

AT first sight it seems odd, but it may be found true. in, the
' sequences of history, that the Japanese are doing all their
hard fighting in this war mainly for the benefit of the Russian
people, and that future descendants of the Slavs will remember the
warriors of the Mikado as emancipators of, their race from stagna
tion and tyranny. The tone of the Russian press, indicates that ; such
is even now the opinion of the Czar's subjects. Probably if they had
the liberty of letting their will be known through a representative
government, the Japanese would learn that the great majority of the
Russian public had no wish to be at war with them. The "Listqk"
says that the lesson of Russian defeat is that -good government and
freedom are always .victorious over ignorance,. misrule and despot
ism. The "SIovo" says the Japanese are not fighting the Russian
people but the Russian bureaucracy, arid the "Russ" states that tHe
Japanese naval victories arid, Oyama's triumphs on land should free
Russia from the slavery of bureaucracy. v
That is certainly th e ' ; most hopeful view of the ; situation that
can be taken by. intelligent,^prosperity-desiring folk of Russia arid
by their friends and the friends of peace throughout the world. lilf
the ruin of Russian armies-arid navies forces reformation. from the
system of bureaucracy which is so given over to robbery aqd- to
graft, the oppressed toilers of the country might well deem : their
nominal enemies 'to be their allies in promoting ithe future welfare
of the. Slavs. The exhaustion of Russia by continued war^may 'force
the calling of a representative assembly, that will voice the true
wishes of the people, and that popular assembly may seize the occa
sion to enforce permanent reforms.;

ENGLISH CHOP.
THE CASE OF JIM.
Up to this time our experience in the islands duplicates that
of Holland in Java. The population of the Dutch tropical colony
has increased so rapidly under Dutch rule that it swarms over the
island. It has proved capable of being taught anything but work.
The Dutch Commissioner of Education finds that all the schooling
of the Malays in book learning has failed to overcome their tropical
idleness. The commercial product of the island is maintained by a
working population of a half million Chinese. They-work regardless
of. tropical sun and wind and weather. They are in the fields and
factories, the shops, and wherever reliable work by hand or head is
required.
j A representative of the Dutch Government is now in this coun
try to see if anything can be learned from a study of our technical
schools that may be usefully applied in teaching the Malays to
work. We fear he will be disappointed. The Chinese is the only
race on the earth that will work faithfully under all conditions of
climate and environment. It is this that causes theril to be consid
ered a pest, and turns the hand of all other races against them.
The Javanese Malay will not work. Holland must get commercial
production out of the colony, and therefore resorts to the service
able Chinese. -'Jv*
The second opinion about the Philippines comes from Com
mander Coffin of our navy, who has been in the islands since the
Spanish war and is on his way to Washington on official business.
.He says "the only salvation for the Philippines, so far as progress
is concerned, will be the free admission of Chinese, who are ready
to labor, while the Filipinos stubbornly persist in leading lives of
indolence." This means that we have the same problem as Holland.
Commander Coffin says that the Filipinos complain that they don't
have as good a time under our Government as they had under
Spain. This is because we tax them and in a missionary spirit have
interfered with their cock fighting, gambling and other amusements
dear to the tropical races. The civilian observer looks at things
with the eye of theory. The naval commander sees the islands
with the eye of a practical man. They show us a. problem from
both sides. The theorist does not say how many generations must
pass while we are teaching the Filipinos to work, rior how "many
hemp harvests must be lost and what expense incurred during the
process. As no tropical people has ever been taught to work unless
in involuntary servitude, have we any method by which we can
teach voluntary labor to the Filipinos ?
We have passed the stage of enthusiasm and brilliant expecta
tion regarding the Philippines, and will soon be in the practical
phases of the problem. The American people must inform them
selves about it. Commander Coffin gives it as his professional
opinion that we need extensive defensive works in the islands if we
expect to retain them against all possible' comers. The entrance to
Manila Bay must be protected by foÂ«rts,' earthworks and guns, just
as we protect the Golden Gate and the bay of San Francisco. But
back of the defenses of the Golden Gate is a population only one
fifth that of. the Philippines, which produces more wealth in one
year than the Philippines in fifty years. Beyond Manila Bay is a
population that resents the prohibition of cock fighting, while half
of the hemp rots in the field. The situation summons to a solution
the common sense and genius of the American people. T{iat a solu
tion will be reached we have no doubt, but no living prophet, seer
or revelator among us can tell what it will be.
Reliable reports are to the effect that this season's hemp crop
is half unharvested and wasted for lack of labor to cut it. Manila
hemp is as staple in the market as cotton. It is in univer
sal demand for rope and cordage. It has no substitute that ap
proaches it in excellence for those uses. It is produced only in
the Philippines. The other island staples, sugar and tobacco, have
competitive production -in many other parts of the earth. Hemp
is a Philippine monopoly. If -all the land in the islands suited to its
production were in action the supply would not overtake the de
mand near enough to affect the price. Yet, with a population
nearly as dense as that of Belgium, half of this valuable crop goes
unbarvested ! Nothing can more clearly disclose industrial condi
tions. It means that the Filipinos have not yet been taught to
work, and that the necessities of life for them are produced so
nearly spontaneously by 4 the bounty of nature that they feel no need

Â«T-*HE public has "before it two recent reports and opinions re-
I spccting industrial conditions in the Philippines. One is by a
*\u25a0 civilian observer, who says that in order to teach the Filipinos
to work and to bring them and the islands to a high state of indus
trial efficiency and production it is absolutely necessary -to rigidly
exclude Chinese and other outside labor. This opinion is based
upon the theory, strongly held by those farthest from the scene,
that a tropicafpeople can be taught to work, regardless of their
physical necessities.

The committee recommended that the
bill providing for the construction of

as supervising- architect be finally pass
ed, notwithstanding^ the Mayor's veto
of the same. D'Ancona and' Braunhart
.were delegated to prepare a report on
the matter. "_'
, Pretfldent'Roncovieri of the Board of
Education called attention to the fact
that the bids 'or the building: under the
bond Issue of biy additional rooms on
the Crocker Grammar School were all
larg-ely in excess of the $17,500 avail
able. Roncovier! stated that this con
dition would likely obtain -with respect
to the other; schoolhouses, notably the
"Washington/ Spring Valley and Burnett
school build Ings, and that It looked as
though It" would be necessary to " sub
mit a supplementary bond issue for the
erection of the .building's. ', . ;>.;
REPORTS AGALVST VETO.
Supervisor Connor held that it would
be unadvisable to select the Holladay
fciteinviftw of the legal objections
raised by Creswell, and his. motion that
the cite be rejected Was carried ' b'y- a
vote of 6 to 1, D'Ancona alone voting in
the negative. -.
The Bite offered by Mrs. Teresa Bell
on the corner of Octavia and Sutter
streets was then discussed and referred
to the Board of Education with a re
quest that it report speedily on the
comparative eligibility of all the sites
under consideration or any others that
may be offered. Â» ( ''
The committee rejected fifty- vara
block 129, adjoining Washington
Square, as a site for a children's play
ground, owing to the. excessive prices
asked, and recommended block 151,
bounded by Chestnut, Powell. Lombard
and Mason streets, for the purpose. City
Attorney Lone was directed to purchase
the block, if possible, for $244,000, the
sum available.
The offer of A. Riddell to sell a site
in the Silver Terrace, Tract for the new
Bay. View â¢ School for 110,250 was ac
cepted.
"The site is the most commanding: in
the city of &> a Francisco," said ; ; Ron -
covieri, "and a $450,000 building will
bo erected thereon. The site is favor
ed by the Board of Education because
4.he pupils will have the advantage of
the park adjoining as a playground.
The Holladay lot itself is large enough
to erect a building of two wings in
the form of an H. with exposure to the
east and south light."
School Director Roncovieri made a
strong plea that the land adjoining La
fayette Park be selected-
ROXCOVIJJRI MAKES PLKA.
Principal Morton said that 20 per cent
of the pupils live north of California
street, and that he favored the Bell slto
on # Octavia. street, between Sutter and
Bush, rather than the Holladay lot,
the depth of which was inadequate.
Crftswell referred' to the City-Attor
ney's opinion, which declares Clay
street, between Gough and Octavia, and
Octavia street, between Sacramento and
Washlpg-tdn, to be part of Lafaj^tte
Park. Creswell held that - permission,
could not be secured from the Park
Commission to have Ingress and egress
to and \u25a0:â¢ from j the Holladay property
even under tha right of -eminent do
main. This would therefore prevent
teaming and hauling of material for
the building: of the Lowell High School.
"Granting: that the school . may be
built on. the lot, it would cost the city
a great deal of money to recover the
land for park purposes." said Creswell.
"It would be folly to put the. building
on the lot in. view of the fact that 90
per cent of the pupils attending tho
school live south of California street
and would bo' compelled to climb the
hills to reach the school."
Harry T. Creswell. former City At
torney, filed on behalf of certain prop
erty owners a protest against the se
lection of the Holladay site. Creswell
went' lnto -'the legal phaseK of the'mat
ter, :iml argued that the .entire four
blocks of land bounded by Gough, La
guiii, Sacramento and Washington
streets had been originally dedicated
for park purposes, . and the property
should not be diverted f/om its first
proposed use. Creswell said that the
Supreme Court had not confirmed the
possession of tne Holladays in the lan<l
chey offered for sale,' and : they should
not be paid 1 cent more than the "land
is worth.
The Supervisors' joint Committee on
Finance and Utilities, yesterday formal
ly rejected the site offered by Â£>. W.
Holladay aud adjoining' â¢ Lafayette
Park for the new Lowell High School
buildina.

MRS. PAXTON'S "ANSWER.
Paxton's attorneys aver: that there is
no'specinc provision j in: the law.forthe
payment of funds- by -a* father: for: the
maintenance of "a-child' pending a final
decision. In answer.' to * this Attorney
Charles F.Hanlon,; representing j the
children, replied v that equltableV power
is vested in the court to make an order
for the \u25a0 payment of 7. funds | for | mainr
tenance whenever., the power' vested 3*n
the court to make the final order." Judge
Graham held 'that this point : was "well
taken and ordered to the hearing- to
proceed. :
\u25a0 In -his affidavit confessing that he: Is
a pauper, which was first : read by : his
counsel, Paxton said that through his
illness he had been compelled "to relin
quish his position as" president: of '-the
Santa Rosa" Bank," which netted him an
income. of J175 a month. Then~in ad
dition to â¢ this salary he said he \u25a0 used
to enjoy an income of : $125 -a month
from certain properties' 'and came
into . possession of wealth from t, the
estate of his father, John A. Paxton,"
and . also inherited r -property f from i his
mother, Hannah " Paxton. But allrof
this, he says, - has ''gone 'in * speculation
in oil and: quicksilver, " his I properties
now being mortgaged . for all they are
worth. ' ' *'â¢
PAXTON LOSES A ' POINT.
Paxton's arhdavit was filed yesterday
in reslatanceVtblthe motion;of,his,chil
dren for temporary, support pending the

tage of every technicality, to aave" him
from defeat, but -thus ; far; they.^ have,
been unsuccessful. .; Judge - Graham ".has

in San \u25a0 Diego County they are supposed to

The weather bureau observer at Point Reyes
reported to the Merchants' Exchange yester
day that the steam schooner National City
had passed that promontory with a wrecked
bark in tow and Cor some time there was. a
nutter of excitement In the local shipping
world. But it was all a mistake. What the
observer had mistaken for a wreck was the
lumber-laden barge Tidal Wave bringing COit,
<KK> feet of lumber from Fort Bragg. ThÂ»
National City, which was towing the barge,
haflJon board 300,CW> feet of lumber from the
came port.
Obnerver AVnÂ» Mistaken.
Captan Harry Marshall of the Spreckels tug
Relief said yesterday that he had no recol
lection of the Incident which was the burden
cf Rear Admiral Goodrich's lengthy complaint
to the Harbor Commissioners at their meeting
en Thursday. The admiral complained thai
Marshall had ignored signals blown by his
tteam launch and that the launch in epite
cf having the right of way was obliged to
etop in order to avoid being run down by
the tug Relief. The Harbor Commissioners
explained to the admiral that it was Uncle
t=am and not Charles Spear who exercised
supervision over the steam vessels of the
American merchant marine and as far as the
commission is concerned the admiral's hot
broadside was fired in vain. Captain Marshall,
whom the admiral in his complaint charged
with being ignorant, careless and a menace,
ig acknowledged to be the most careful, most
capable and most conservative of all the tow
boat masters in a. port famous for the skill
o* the men who handle ito tugs.
Marshall Does Not Remember.

sometimes occurs. The heights given are in
addition to the soundings of the United States

sign precedes the height, and then the number

of the lower low waters. <
Two years ago off the Washington
coast she was driven ashore in a heavy
gale. When the wind died down and the
waters subsided the remains of the Tan
ner were lying among the potato vines
almost as far Inland as the cabin of the
eettler on whose clearing the old ! brig
had laid her bones. Any vessel but the
Tanner would have been on tfiat Wash
ington farm yet, and Â«yen the Tanner
took quite a rest. But the brig was part
of the life of Captain Newhall, and that
rugged old mariner succeeded in getting
his boat back into the water. He put
her In commission again and made a trip
to this port. During the voyage she de
veloped a series of alarming leaks. The
crew mutinied, but changed their minds
efter an interview with Captain Newhall
and brought the vessel to this port.
She returned to Port Angeles and there
was dismantled and consigned to the
boneyard. And now, in the fiftieth year
of the brig's age, comes Captain E. R.
Estvold and buys the sturdy bones of the
ancient brig. With the new owner in
command the Tanner left Port Angeles
on Thursday for Mukilteo, where she will
load lumber for San Francisco. If her
timbers can hold the cargo together the
cargo will keep the Tanner afloat, and
there is a strong probability that before
many days have passed John Hyslop,
from his tower on Point L#obos, will tele
phone to the Merchants' Exchange,
"Brig Tanner in distress, five miles."
The brig Tanner is going to celebrate
her Jubilee by making another voyage
from the north to this port. At least half
m. dozen times has this time-worn craft
been wrecked, and as often has her obitu
ary been written. She has been sailing
the eeas since 1855, when ebe was
launched from a shipyard long passed
away at Smithtown, N. Y. "Arrived, brig
Tanner, in distress," Is an entry which
appears with eurprlsing frequency on the
records of the Merchants' Exchange. She
knows all about Davy Jones' locker from
personal observation, and more than once
in the "disaster" column of the marine
records ehe has been clashed as "wreck,
total loss."

This week may be summed up in the

Relatively best advices come from sur

the feeling in the South Is likewise better.
Against this is to be noted some tempor
ary quieting, due to rains or cold weather,

East, while new business In iron and steel
is smaller and prices are easing. All

NEW YORK, June 9. â Considerable
merriment has been caused by a strike
of paupers in a County Almshouse Just
outside Jersey City.' The men detailed
to act as bakers organized and elected
a walking delegate, who notified the
county board in charge of the institu
tion that his fellows would not knead
the Almshousedough until their names
were put on the pay roll with the at
tendants and other employes:
The delegate explained to the cora
mltteemen that the bakers were en
titled to pay, . because, unlike many
other paupers, they d^o not desert the

Housewives in the Liatln quarter xom-,
plained to Patrolman James. O'Connor
that a one-armed ' vagabond had a pen
chant-for prowling in back. yards atnia
tutinal hours and ' frightening ' all ' timid
persons who beheld him by his eerie tout
ensemble and eccentric behavior. So the
officer lay low and at 5 o'clock yesterday
morning found the person complained of
doing the very things : alleged. He said
his name was Narino Carrera, that j his
crippled condition prevented ,hlfn obtain
ing employment and ; that he . visited .the
back yards in; quest of food, ilt'.was in
pity, that Judge ' Cabanlss sentenced him
to thirty days' imprisonment.
William O'Connor, ; a cripple, was ac
cused of keeping ; disorderly house in
a rear room of his cigar store on Mis
sion street, near Sixteenth,, and ten
young fellows were charged with hav
ing aided and abetted him In the of
fense. Patrolman Rler, who made the
arrests, suspected poker playing, but
had no evidence â¢to prove lt, and the
defendants alleged that the reason for
their congregating, was social inter
course, they having-, organised a club
for that very purpose. .
"It's h funny, thing," one of the
juveniles remarked, ."that we hard
woikin* gents get pinched, for running
a club and the swell mugs downtown
are never touched." Â«
Argument accepted as clincher and
case dismissed by jSidg-e Cabanlss. '
Loretta Jackson, 16 years of age and
pretty, was given six months for in
corrigible waywardness, and Emma
Braig. similarly, accused and also young
and good looking, was placed in <fus

tron from Oakland, with admonition
that if the girl' is ever caught again in
San Frnacisco "she- will -also be Im
prisoned for, half a r year. ->"â¢' -
Seventeen-year-old Hazel/Adams was
so infatuated with the night life of the
Barbary Coast that after being twice
sent back to her parents In Oakland
she was found In an apartment of
Harry Farley's dance hall, 631 Pacific
street, by the policeman who had been
instructed to keep her out of circula
tion on this side of bay. It was
Suspected that she was the girl alluded
to in an anonymous threatening let
ter recently received by Judge Mogan,
and that suspicion was strengthened
when she said to his Honor, ere the
missive was mentioned:
"I'm sure it ain't my fault If my
friends write letters to you about me."
She was given five days and informed
that if she doos not return to Oakland
at the expiration of that period she
will be rearrested and given six
months.

the fight was that one man was standing
in a barroom when another man entered
and promptly knocked him down, vouch
safing no reason for the attack. 1 Nor did
the felled one solicit explanation, for he
regained hla feet as speedily as he*could
and drew a knife, with which he hinged
at his assailant, who brandished a simi
lar weapon and lunged In return. Then
the bartender prudently suggested that
for the sake of his good name- and fair
fame the warring gentlemen retire to the
street and there settle their differences,
and the suggestion was in course of adop
tion when the policeman spoiled the fes
tivity. " Considerable cloth was cut and
blood drawn ere the combat ceased, the
defendants averred, but for the life of
them they could not, tell who the fighting
men were or what became of them after
some vigilant spectator said, "Cheese It,
boys; cops." '
So the trio were discharged from cus
tody, and Patrolman Harrlgan gazed at
them with the expression of one who dla
believes.
When the Chinese larniderers removed
their presence and the implements of
their craft from a ramshackle cottaie at
Sacramento and Scott streets the neigh
borhoodâwhich had long been hungering
for tbe distinction of having a "haunted
house" in Its midstâ at once installed va
rious shadowy tenants therein. Little
boys and girls an<s not a few adults told
of having seen grewsoine sight* .in and
around the dingy, building. and Also gave
Imitations of hair-raising sounds which
they had heard emanate therefrom after
nightfall. So it came to pass that the
cottage was nocturnally shunned: by all
prudent residents of tne vicinage, and
only the skeptics viewed . it with the
freedom from fear that they displayed
during its days of corporal occupancy.
Among the latter, element was Patrol
man Webster. The cottage was on his

"Most "of the jobs are small, only
for a few thousand dollars. Do the
men of this city, expect me to write
circular" letters to all the carpenters
in the town? I am paid to do other
work. Whenever there is a job to be
let I send a circular letter to two or
three reliable ' firms and they send \u25a0in
their offers. I mall these direct to
Washington. Sometimes I make a rec
ommendation that a certain party be
given the contract and sometimes I do
not. The result has been satisfactory
to me and I think that my superiors
have no fault to find with my methods.
This complaint seems to me to be
merely the soreheadedness of parties
who expect me to come around to them.
Once I asked a lot of firms to , make
bids and not half of them acknowl
edged ray letter. That finished them
with, me." t
Around the customs offices the story,
of the alleged favoritism has been
current for some time. No one there,
however, lays it to any definite source.
In the meantime Secretary Robinson
will quietly, conduct an investigation,
before his , return to the East.
\u25a0 "I have been in charge of over 1300.
000 worth'of work,** he sald,~"and out
of all this â¢ I , only advertised In the
newspapers for bids once. That was
for a $45,000 job on the maintenanca
of the United States Mint. The Gov
ernment requires that there shall be
competition in all work done for it. It
does not say how many firms shall be
asked to figure on the contract, but
leaves that to the discretion of the su
perintendent. Mind you, I don't award
the contract; I merely get the bids and
send them forward to Washington. The
authorities there inform me whom they
have selected.
Superintendent Roberts protested
yesterday that he knew nothing of any
charges against him. He spoke freely,
however, of his method of obtaining
bids for the work that is done under
his supervision.
ROBERTS' . EXPLAXATIOX.
Secretary Robinson is staying at the
home of Dr. H. W. Allen at 1300 Wash
ington street. He has remained in this
city after his superior. Assistant Treas
urer Taylor, left for the Lewis and
Clark Exposition. While he was not
at home yesterday afternoon and con
sequently could not be seen, it is stated
on reliable authority that the object of
his lengthened visit here is the investi
gation of the charges brought by the
contractors.
The request for- an inquiry is made
at this time because of several new
contracts to be let for the work on
the Appraisers' building at Sansome
and Jackson streets. The offices of
the United States courts are to be
moved from this building Into the new
postoffice. The customs office will be
transferred to the rooms left vacant by
the United States courts. The third
floor of the Appraisers" building will
have to, be remodeled and new parti
tions and modern furniture put in. It
is this job, said to be worth about
$10,000. that the contractors desire to
have open to all bidders and not kept
within the reach of a few, says Drey-Â»
fus in his complaint. - \u25a0 .
WORK IX PROSPECT.
Dreyfus claims that Roberts has ad
vertised in the papers for bids on only
one or two big jobs and that on all
others he has sent out circular letters
to the" two or three favored firms,
which have consequently gained all the
work. Dreyfus is supported by many:
other building contractors and they
have reported the state of affairs tj>
E. E. Robinson, private secretary of
Assistant Treasurer Taylor of Wash
ington. D. C. The latter has authority
over the superintendent of the new
postofflce, and these firms ask that
Robinson make a thorough investiga
tion of the dealings of Roberts with,
regard to the admission of bids tot.
contract work.
E. B. Dreyfus, a member of the Cal
ifornia "Woodwork Company of 409
Jackson street, has made complaint at
Washington against Superintendent Jo
seph W. Roberts, Government officer in
charge of the erection of the new post
office building at Mission and Seventh
streets, alleging rank favoritism to
ward certain contracting firms. It is
charged that the official has discrim
inated outrageously in favor of a few
firms in opportunity to make bids on
the furnishing of material,' work and
labor on the structures under his con
trol, and an investigation has been de
manded. . " .

ot absolute stagnation. Even the temporary

Bf traders to find Â£n available course for a
Kovenient ot prices was lacking. The lirst

fcuct ot coherency early in the day, tut the
itver movements were entirely comueed and
irrc-jrular. Such a market can have only a
negative significance, as prices suggest no
interpretation, but the idleness in itself is
ar. index of the condition of doubt and un
certainty which oppresses speculative t>entl
niert. Some influence is attributed to tbt
fact of the coming Whitsuntide holiday in
London, which drove the London market into
a 'condition cJ idleness almost equal to our
own. The heavy railing off in the activity of 1
â¢ tracing is responsible for th*; sharp decline
In the price of Stock Exchange seats, a sale '\u25a0
beir.s reported at J72.500. The previous Bale. !
ten dnye ago t was at $75,000, and the high
price of $$4,000 was paid within the year.
Some of the disposition to defer operations
v.;.b attributed to the desire to know the
completion of to-morrow's Government report i
on the June 1 condition of the grain crops.
The wavering movement in the grain markets
indicated tome unsettlement over the imme
diate prospects. It Is not expected that any
pronounced position will be aFtumed In the
stock market on the basis of the year"s har
vÂ«^t until the critical period for the crops,
Â«overs.l wt<=kg hence, has been passed. The
Ecjultable Life affair furnished no immediate
Incident for discussion to-day, but its great
li.fiuence in deterring from any ventures in
the stock is unimpaired. Opinions over tbe
bank statement arc mixed owing to the large
eppotal operations which have occurred, in
oludinK the shifting of deposits incident to
the transfer of the Japanese loan proceeds".
Call money was slightly firmer, but not enough
bo to be an influence. Some consideration is
beginning to be given, hoy.-ever. to the pre
parations for thÂ» half yearly settlements. The
u?ual interest and dividend disbursements may
have more than the customary supplement in
tbe demar.d to replenish reserves by the trust
companies. It is expected that the operations
.oj thib week hav e bern to the advantage of
the trust company reserve at the expense of
the bank reserve*. The Â«Ã¼b- treasury has ab

Members of v Special Board
Decide That Lieutenant's
Death Was Accidental
PAETICULAKS UNKNOWN
Last Seen by Watch at After
Port Gangway Shortly Be
fore His Disappearance
In a report that covers in detail the re
sults of two days' investigation and the
sworn testimony of officers and- crew of
the revenue cutter Rush, the board of in
quiry has reached : the conclusion , that
Lieutenant William' G. Blasdelj- "navigat-:
ing* officer' of : the ship, came -to his death 1
by drowning, as 'the result .of- accident,
circumstances unknown. The report \u25a0 will
be forwarded to Washington, and as' far
as the revenue cutter service is concerned
the findings are conclusive. : >
The theory of suicide, usually entering
such cases, has at no time been consid
ered, either by Blasdel's brother officers
or his relatives. The missing- officer ' had
everything to live for' and was 'â¢ looking
forward to the arrival of his wife . and
little daughter from New Orleans ; in ; a
short time. The theory of the officers
aboard the Rush" is- that the lieutenant
went to the af terport gangway, ;where he
was seen by the watch on the hurricane
deck. In some way he must have slipped
on the brass plate and: in falling. must
have struck something and been rendered
senseless" before entering the water. This
w"ould account for the failure of the
watch to hear a cry and , for the officer
failing to regain the ship, \ as he was an
excellent swimmer. â¢',) /
The theory advanced by: L. G. Blasdel,
a brother of Lieutenant/Blasdel, is>that
the revenue officer incurred the enmity
of a member of the crew and was struck
on the head and. .lowered over, the side.
This fact was probed" into by the. board
of inquiry, and the resultant testimony
showed that It' was not worthy of further
consideration! There was no reason
known by the officers why Blasdel should
seek to leave the service. | However, the
precaution jras taken to ; quietly, search
Sausalito, but no trace of the lieutenant
was found. ' â¢ .- \u25a0'
Yesterday the small boats of the Rush
were out on the bay . with grappling
hooks and lines dragging for the body.
The task \u25a0was \u25a0 considered as almost hope
less, as the tides that sweep through the
bay have seldom been known to give up
the dead. A>
The supposed mystery in the case
caused, so much' comment,, in Sausallto
that / the crew of the Rush were denied
shore leave yesterday. While the board
of inquiry was on the Rush no one was
allowed aboard. The fin4l meeting of the
body took place yesterday, at 1 o'clock
and lasted all afternoon. V. <y
The board-"* appointed '.'.to inquire into
the case comprised Captain F. A. Munr
ger, inspector of the life-saving service;
Captain H. B. - Rogers ' ol the} life-saving
service and Surgeon Cummings of the
Marine Hospital. -At \ the preliminary
meeting Thursday afternoon all the'tes
timony was taken and the ; board f was
then ready to report, It ..was learned,
however, that Blasdel had a life insur
ance policy, and in order, to assist the
widow in claiming the money the .testi
mony was repeated yesterday and sworn
to by the witnesses. The unusual holding
of a second day's inquiry gave color to
the rumors surrounding Lieutenant'Blas
del's death. : . '

Projectors of Line to Oroville
Meet and Discuss Con
struction.
At a conference held yesterday at the
Et. Francis Hotel plans were finally com
pleted for the construction of the new
electric railroad from Chlco to Oroville.
Those present at the meeting were Henry
Butters, the millionaire mining man of
Oakland; T. B. Walker, a Minneapolis
timber magnate who Is also extensively
Interested In timber lands In this State,
and President Barber, General Manager
Graves. Chief Engineer Robinson, Man
ager Clough and Attorney Jones of the
Diamond Match Company. Aiiuough the
.new road has always been regarded as a
Diamond Match Company project, prob
ably by reason of the fact that Its of
ficials are among its promoters. Million
aires Butters and Walker are really the
ones who will furnish the majority of
the capital for the enterprise.
' It was decided to Incorporate imme
diately a company that will be known as
the Chico Southern Railway, and grading
along the route, of which a Burvey was
'recently completed under the direction of
Engineer Robinson,, will -begin at once.
Material for the road will be ordered in a
few weeks. T. B. Walker expressed a
preference to remain in the background,
but the fact became known that he has
Interested himself in the project.
The fact that John Martin, who Is plan
ning to build an electric road from Marys
ville to Grass Valley, has been meeting
with the projectors of the road between
Chico and Oroville, and held a conference
.with the latter yesterday, has given rise
to the belief that his company will even
tually make connections with the Chlco
"Southern and In time promote the scheme
to build a road from Marysville to Sac
ramento by way of Colusa.
After laboring for nearly two hours
yesterday afternoon till they were all but
exhausted the firemen of Engine 30 res
cued. Patrick Lynch, a laborer, from a
sand pit at Buena Vista and Park Hill
avenues. When pulled out of his prison
Lynch was weak from shock and the per
spiration poured from his forehead.
Lynch and some other laborers were
digging a trench for the Board of Public
Works. The spot was sandy and the re
cent high winds had made the sand as
dry as powder. It drifted in huge heaps.
Lynch was down in the pit when the
sand began to cave, and suddenly he was
entirely surrounded, only his head peering
above the ground.
He cried for aid and his companions set
about to assist him. They worked for
several minutes, but their efforts were of
no avail, as the dry, parched sand began
to drift rapidly and Lynch was being
wedged In tighter and firmer as the min
utes passed. He realized his perilous po
sition and his cries attracted people for
many blocks.
When his fellow workmen saw It was
impossible to rescue him they rang up
Engine 30. The firemen hastened to the
scene with ropes and ladders and other
tackle. . The entire crew ,worked for near
ly two hours before Lynch was rescued.
The workman is about six feet two
inches in height, and had he been a small
man he would have met an awful death
In a very few minutes.
The firemen experienced much difficulty
in keeping the sand from getting into
Lynch's eyes. It was drifting rapidly,
and as fast as one heap was moved an
other had taken its place. Lynch suf
fered great pain while the firemen worked
to rescue him, and. was on the point of
collapsing when . rescued. The firemen
finally managed to fasten a rope under
Lynch's arms and after a long tug he
was pulled out of the hole. â¢

IS L^D. Batchelor has a remarkable story
to tell In his suit for. divorce from Susie
Batchelor. Batchelor says his wife has
lost all respect for herself, her. children
and her husband. He says she beats
their little ones, Alvina, Wayne and Ran
dolph; and on numerous occasions has
turned them out of doors in the rain "and
sent: them some distance from the house
that she- might entertain various men. ln
their home, one Michael Cummlngs being
,her,> most frequent visitor, vHe says she
has left her little children alone in their
home on a" Sonoma County ranch after!
dark, leaving a coal oil lamp burning,
with no one to >. watch It and no one to
keep the children away from It. In con
clusion he alleges that she has threatened
to v poison her children and herself. In
addition , to \u25a0" a ' decree of divorce he asks
that his wife be enjoined from going near
their; home 'or Interfering with the chil
dren In any way.
Suits for divorce were also filed by Ber
tha, Sutton against Lawrence E. Button
for cruelty, Josephine H. 'Schmidt "against
John W: E. Schmidt for failure to pro
vide, \u0084 Johanna E. Fink against Martin
Fink ' for; cruelty and Hilda M. Wild

. Anna Gowah filed suit yesterday against
Walter Go wan to annul their , marriage,
which' occurred November 5, 1904. Mrs.
Gowan alleges that her , husband had a
wife living when she wedded' him.
'-' Johnson . Newsom, : who owns stock \u25a0 val

> Though t her ; husband. Dr.- George R.
Hubbell,. was granted a divorce from her
last i month, Mrs. Dr. ' Harriet H. Hubbell
has-'not! yet . abandoned -. claim to him.
Yesterday, she filed a suit . for mainten
ance, : alleging ; that he deserted her on
July 14,* 1904, and has since failed to con
tribute 7to , her support. This suit â¢ will
raise a new question under. the Interlocu
tory.^ divorce law. Though Hubbell was
granted : a I divorce on ". the : ground of cru
elty,'^ Mrs/.Hubbell raises the point that
as she has filed a motion fora new trial
and that as the decree in any .event^wlll
not go into effect forgone year -she Is en
[ titled to maintenance in the meantime.
â¢Mrs. I Comyns' testimony . was - corrobo
rated and she was granted a decree with
out delay. 1
OTHER .DECREES GRAFTED.
1 "Finally I forgave him upon his prom
ise, not -to repeat his action, but a. short
time . ago . he again returned home drunk
and i started . to abuse me. Then I decided
to sue for a divorce.'.*
Laura M. . Comyns was granted a di
vorce yesterday by Judge Graham from
Thomas L. Comyns, a member of \u25a0 the
firm of Comyns & Childer, metal roofers,
after reciting a tale of cruelty seldom
equaled even in the divorce courts of San
Francisco. She testified that one, night
about a year, ago her husband arrived at
their home In * an ! Intoxicated condition.
Without a word, ; he grabbed her by the
arms, carried J her : past - their screaming
children to ah' upper bedroom, threw her
Into a "corner and then, drawing a re
volver, told her . to prepare for death.
"I argued with my husband," said Mrs.
Comyns, "telling him that he must have
lost his senses to talk that way. and
finally I caught . him off his guard and
grappled with him. We fought all over
the room, my husband trying to shoot
me, but finally his j foot struck a trunk,
he. tripped and In falling released his hold
of .the 'revolver. - I picked it up, unlocked
the door quickly and running to the head
of 'the stairs " threw "it down. He reeled
after it, and I again struggled with him
to . get down - first, â¢ but when we arrived
the revolver was nowhere to be seen." It
had slid unbar a heavy hat rack, where
I afterwan! ; found it. While we were
looking for the revolver the doorbell rang,
and- this saved my life. ' because my hus
band left by the back way when he knew
some one was about to enter. .
Telegraph Hill residents turned out
In, force yesterday to witness the at
tack of the city on the works. of Gray
Bros., the Globe Grain and Milling
Company,' John Kelso and others In
Judge Slosa' court. It Is aald that the
defendants ars unlawfully removing:
material from the corner of Wlnthrop
and Chestnut streets. The suit of the
city Is being conducted by Assistant
City and County Attorney John T.
Nourse. " '
On behalf of the defendants It was
contended that tne excavating: 'was be
ing done not on the street, but on the
Globe company's land and that under
a resolution of the Board of Supervis
ors. They admitted that a subsequent
resolution rescinded the former, but
held that the board had no right to re
scind it and thus abrogate a contract
and destroy a vested right. â¢ The court
held, however, that the board had the
right to rescind any action taken and
ordered the hearing to proceed. Alter
the plaintiff had presented Its case a
continuance until Monday was ordered.
