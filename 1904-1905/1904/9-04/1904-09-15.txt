SACRAMENTO. Sept. 14.â Dr. E. K.
Foster, secretary of the State Board of
Health, in his official report to the Gov
ernor, makes complaint that the law
imposes important duties on the board,
but bestows very little power. The re
port states after relating the section of
law which outlines the duties 'of the
State Board of Health that the act
gives the board a- broad field of inves
tigation and work, with but little
power to make its work, effective, since
it do*s not- oblige local Boards of
Health to answer questions -made by
the State Board; does not allow the en
forcement .of, proper measures 'to pro
tect life and health; gives no' means
for eradicating causes of disease 'and
epidemics or for dissemination inform
ation to the people, other than through
the good nature of the public press.
The report says, that the public will
heedlessly, neglect all sanitary precau
tions. . use. .water polluted with wash
ings of barn yards and houses; .allow
children sick â¢' with, contagious diseases
to associate with the well; tolerate
school house with poor light and worse
ventilation, and if an effort be made

demic of , contagious disease people are
up in arms because of cost or trouble.
But let glanders attack the horse or

Cpeelal Cable to The Call and New York
Herald. Copyright, 1901, by the New Tork
Herald Publishing Company.
LONDON. Sept. 14.â S. F. Edge is de
lighted to hear that M. Charley offers
a prize of 510,000 for the first motor
boat to cross the Atlantic, because in
March next he will be sending one
across to New Tork. Edge, in an In
terview, said:
"It falls in admirably with my plans.
I have for some time had under con
struction for a wealthy American a
craiEing mcrtor boat, and one of the
terms of the contract is that she shall
cross the Atlantic, tcr be delivered in s
N*"v.- York on her own keel. 1 expect
the will be ready in March, eo that I
ou?:ht to stand a good chance of win
ning the prize."
AEked what was the size of the boat
he was building, Edge replied:
"She will be sixty-five feet long and
will carry six passengers and a crew of
two men. That seems a small crew,
but everything ought to be automatic
and once the engine is started the crew
ought to have little to do.
"We have been instructed to do the
beEt we can, regardless of price, and
the boat therefore will be very lux
urious. She will have 200 horse-power
Â«!Sines: in reality she will have more,
bf^ause there will be two engines on
*ach *ldj? of 150 horse-power apiec* and
a center one of 40 hor6e-power. Â¦-â¢
"But the fmall engine is for use in
cruising at a slow pace and coming
alongside, where big power could not
be handily and economically used. The
40 hors*-power engine may be used
with others when the boat is traveling
at speed, but we do not look to it for
much assistance."
Captain Berlinsky and Consul Ko
sakeiitch have evidently come to the
conclusion that there Is no hope of
the auxiliary cruiser Lena's leaving
the port of San Francisco until the
war Is over In the Orient. They sent
a communication to Collector of the
Port F. S. Stratton yesterday asklnsr
what would be required by the United
States Government as to dismantling
of the ship should that be the conclu
sion, they put it, of the present nego
tiations.
The Russian officials evince much
concern as to the fate in store for the
Lena hi the disarmament process.
They arc anxious about what the re
quirements will be and Indicate that
they have given up the effort to have
the vessel refitted with boilers in this
neutral port and allowed to proceed
again to the scene of conflict.
It is believed that the communica
tion addressed to Collector Stratton
was authorized hi instructions from
St. Petersburg. The Collector at once
forwarded it to- Washington and will
make no answer until he is advised by
his superiors.
Russian Consul Kosakevitch went
to.Vallejo yesterday afternoon to In
spect the dock at Mare Island navy
yard. This is taken as preliminary to
acceptance of a proposal to pnt the
Lena out of service at the Govern
ment yard. . â¢Â« .
The letter to Collector Stratton was
lengthy and made request for a specific
statement of all the details connected
with dismantling of a ship according
to the requirements of the United
States in such cases. Questions were
put as to whether the vessel's guns
would be taken from their positions on
the Lena's decks, whether the ship
itself would be in any way disabled,
whether the engines would be discon
nected and parts removed, whether the
ammunition would be removed; in
short, precisely what would be done to
place the war vessel on a dismantled
basis, in event that course should be 1
adopted. . I
The communication bore chiefly on 1
this subject of dismantlement. Collec
tor Stratton refused to discuss the let
ter, saying it would be referred to the
proper authorities at Washington in
the due course of business connected
with the Lena Incident.
WAITING FOR INSTRUCTIONS.
It is understood in official circles that
the Russian .captain is unwillin- at
this time to consent to dismantlement
owing to the non-receipt of specific in
structions from St. Petersburg, for
which request by cable ha3 been sent.
Pending such advices the local repre
sentatives have been apparently in
structed to ascertain what is involved
in the probable dismantling of the
Lena.
On this subject the United States
Government officials, speaking from
general knowledge of the law, say that
the Lena would, if dismantled. b<Â» re
lieved of all of the gus. ammunition or
other war material, that her engines
would be so treated as to be rendered
unserviceable, and that she would bo
literally placed out of commission until
the ned of the war.
That this will ultimately occur, the
highest Government officials who have
to deal directly with the situation ex
press not the least doubt. In those
circles the expression, unofficial of
course at this ttm*. Is unanimous that
the Lena will be dismantled as soon as
the course of Governmental Inquiry haa
been completed.
The departments of State, of ths
Treasury and of Commerce and Labor
at Washington have been advised that
the re-examination of the Lena, which
has been ordered, is under way.
It was pointed out yesterday that the
Lena might with hasty repairs get
away in thirty days' and by the use of
an enormous quantity of coal run from
six to eight knots an hour and per
haps reach a home" port by frequent
replenishing of her coal supply. This
is not "seaworthy," as contemplated by
the law.
BUNKERS ARE ALMOST EMPTY.
Captain Berllnsky's reported state
ment that he was well supplied with
coal is discredited. It is known in
United States Government circles that
the Lena has in her bunkers only 250
tons of. coal. It is estimated that this
would serve the ship for not more than
two days' run.
With this Knowledge gained another
question arises in officialdom, and that

fuel. Under the code of nations the
Lena would be entitled, were the Rus
sians permitted to repair, to take
enough coal to carry htr to the nearest

OYSTER BAY, L. I., Sept. .14.âRob
ert M. McWade, American Consul-Gen
eral at Canton, China, has been re
moved from office by President Roose
velt. Charges made against him re
cently were investigated by | Assistant
Secretary Pierce, who went to the
Orient to make an investigation of sev
eral of the United States consulates in
China and Japan. Secretary Pierce, in
his report to the President, strongly
sustains the charges made against Mc-
Wade. The order for McWade's dis
missal went forward to-day.
â¢ WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â Notice of
the removal of Robert M. McWade as
Consul -General at Canton has been ex
pected for a long time. Before Third
Secretary Pierce started last winter on
his visit to the Chinese consulates so
many charges had been lodged with
the State Department, though not gen
erally in official form, that the removal
of the Consul-General was certain, if
only a small portion of them were es
tablished. __
The more serious of the allegations
connected the Consul-General's name
with the improper issuance of certifi
cates to Chinese bound for the Philip
pines or the United States. There also
was talk of excessive fees.
McWade was one of the most widely
known newspaper men in Washington
and Philadelphia before his appoint
ment to the consular service.

DENVER, Sept. 14,â The Republican
State convention met in this city to
day and nominated the following can
didates: .
Presidential Electors, David H. Mof
fatt, Percy S. Ryder, P. B. Stewart,
Simon' Guggenheim and John C. Os
good; Congressman -at-large, i Franklin
E. Brooks of El Paso Counter Gover
nor, James H. 'Peabody; Lieutenant-
Governor, J. - F. McDonald of Lake;
Treasurer, J. A. Holm berg of Denver;
Secretary, James Cowle of Boulder;
Auditor, A. E. Bentof Prowers; Attor
ney-General, N. C. "Miller of La Plata;
Superintendent of Public Instruction,

gents of University, Thomas D. Baird
of Huerfano, Dr. A. Johnson of Mont
rose.. . D. â¢ B. . Falrley was re-elected
chairman of tha St&t* Central Com
mittee.
The slate was broken In the selection
of Holmberg as Treasurer over Gill of
Denver. Another attempt was made to
break the slate In the nomination of
Superintendent of Public Instruction,
but It failed.
One of the incidents of the conven
tion was a speech by John W. Springer,
who placed Greely W. Whitford in
nomination for Congressman-at-large,
and then withdrew, his name before the
vote was announced. Springer In.nom
inating Whitford took occasion, to de
nounce certain Republicans who voted
against him for Mayor of Denver" last
May, and who, he said, were now sit
ting in the convention.
"The leading name on your electoral
ticket," he said, "is a man who found
It necessary to issue a statement to the
public press In the last- municipal cam
paign advocating the election of the
Democratic candidates â the man
through whose efforts the defeat of the
Republican candidates w&s encom
passed."
The wildest confusion followed this
statement, but Springer continued, say-
Ing notwithstanding this he ! would sup
port-the ticket and vote for Moffatt.
The platform adopted by the conven
tion Indorsed the national platform
adopted at Chicago. On 'local issues
the administration \ of Â¦ Governor Pea
body was indorsed and the platform
called upon all citizens, Irrespective of
party, to support him In, his ; efforts, to
"rebuke the spirit of lawlessness which
would turn popular -government, into
irresponsible despotism and keep alive
class hatred, lawlessness and treason.'/

SALINAS, Sept. 14.â Word was re
ceived this evening from Pajaro to the
effect that R. C. Vaughan, 24 years old,
had been found dead on a chicken
ranch opposite his parents' home. The
body was discovered forty yards from
the cabin used by the owner of the
ranch, who Is absent at present. Cir
cumstances lead to the belief that mui
der has been committed. Last night
about 8 o'clock Vaughan left home,
stopping a few minutes at De Back's
ranch. Soon after his departure the
members of the De Back family heard
three shots in rapid succession. This
mornig the young man was found dead.
Examination showed three bullet holes,
close together, In his head, evidently
made by a weapon of small caliber.

The calling of the roll showed that
five .members of the conference had
died during the yearâ Rev. J, E. Bad
ger, J. N. Beard, P. G. Buchanan, J.

made postmaster, Rev. E. R, Willis
chorister and Mrs. J. F. Kellogg organ

Various standing and special commit
tees were revised, which completed the
organization of the session. At the last
session of the "conference a plan was
adopted by which a collection of 10
cents per member was to be taken In
all the churches and each pastor was
asked to devote 1 per cent of his salary
to make a fund from which the salaries
of pastors receiving less than $600 were
to be raised, if possible, to that sum
as a minimum.
The committee was enlarged to re
formulate plans for this purpose, since
the returns on the present plan were
so meager, only about fifteen standing
to Indicate that they had taken the
collection.' A large number indicated
their willingness to give the required
percentage to this fund.
Rev. G. L. Pearson, presiding elder
of the Hawaiian-Japanese district, pre
sented to the conference a gavel made
in HawajJ and given by the church of
the Island. The gavel is made of three
kinds of wood, representing, aa the
donor said, three elements of the Island
churchâ Korean, Japanese and English
speaking people. Rev. Frank L. Hart,
representing 1 the working of the
Methodist Mutual Fire Insurance Com
pany of Chicago,'' stated that the com
pany now covered $23,000,000 worth of
church property.
Sessions were ordered , to commence
promptly at 8 a. m. and close at 12
ml- The first hour will be devoted to
evangelistic services, to be led by Rev.
Joseph Smith, one of the leading evan
gelists of the' church. The Bishop
brought to the conference $13,091 as the
part of the proceeds of the book con
cern due the California conference, and
$22 from the ' chartered fund. The at

"It becomes then an important ques
tion whether it is not incumbent upon
us to amend our therapeutics. Facts
are stubborn things. Facts like the
cures mentioned are extremely inter
esting. Those seriously afflicted with
nervous afflictions, finding no' relief
from ordinary methods of treatment,
gladly avail themselves of any means
which promise a cure. It may not be
long until the masseur, as the nurse,
will prove an invaluable aid to the
physician.
"There is no method of treatment
which is not by right the property of
the medical profession. The near fu
ture will probably see us making larger
use of manual therapeutics for the re
lief of our otherwise incurable dis
eases."
This article broupht forth a storm of
protests from old-time members of the
society, who denounced the editorial. as
heretic. This was followed by other
articles citing numerous cures and cul

a sensational wrangle that has been
waged in the society fur a year, over
an editorial which admitted the utter
inability of the science of medicine to
reach certain forms o-f paralysis, which
it had been definitely established could
be* successfully treated and actually
cured by a young masseur of this city,

NEW YORK, Sept. 14. â Bourke
Cockran was the principal speaker to
night at a Tammany rally in the Wig
wam. He said:
The returns from â¢ Maine indicate that we
can elect the Democratic ticket. Prior to. the
letter of acceptance issued by the J President
there were a good many people who thought
that the platforms of the parties were prac
tically identical, and that It was merely a
question of which of the two candidates
should enjoy the emoluments and honors of the
oftice.
Sees Hope for Democracy in the Re
turns From Maine.
COCKRAN TALKS TO TIGERS.
A contingency, therefore. Is possible, though
It may be remote, that the people of the United
States will have elected either one of these
gentlemen lndirctly for their chief magistrate.
The voter must take Into consideration In cast-
Ing his ballot whether his choice would be
either of these gentlemen as compared with
Roosevelt. Fairbanks. John Hay, Lesli'e M.
Shaw and William H. Taft.
Every President must necessarily select the
men who will fill these places from his most
distinguished advisers and friends in the con
vention. This rule Is Inviolable and cannot
be avoided. The two gentlemen who would
thus be honored beyond all others would be
Governor Hill and W. J. Bryan. Then would
come a southern man. and John Sharp 'Wil
liams would be entitled to consideration.
I call attention to this . pregnant fact: In
our brief history, by natural death or assas
sination.- the presidency has become vacant
and a succession Under the constitution neces
sary five times. It /Is a contingency always
before us. If Judge Parker should be elected
the respected and honored citizen who Is the
second on the ticket will enter upon Its In
cumbency in his eighty-second year. That
presents also the possibility of the constitu
tional rule of succession coming Into force.
Under the law. If the President and Vice Pres
ident die, the members of his Cabinet succeed
in the order of creation of those ministries â
first, the Secretary of State; second, the Sec
retary of the Treasury; third, the Secretary
of War.
Senator Fairbanks was followed by
Major Francis B. Fremont, U. -S. A.,
who spoke briefly. Senator Depew
spoke next. He said: ,
In good time. 'In God's province, victory was
given to your cause. It was not achieved un
til after our Institutions were put to the su
preme test. 'With the best blood of the re
public, the crime which summoned you to
your exalted service was washed away.
The achievements of the Republican party
constitute the most luminous pages in Ameri
can history. T|pty have no parallel in all of
the ample annals of the past.
The Republican party has not been . the
nerveless party of expediency. It has stood
for the right and challenged all comers. It
has met every emergency which has- arisen
upon the high level of duty and honor. Above
mere party triumph it has put the welfare of
the people. To paraphrase the historic utter
ance of our first great leader, the v^epublican
party has been a party of the people., by the
people and for the people. It has possessed in
an eminent degree the initiative faculty.\ It
has be*>n progressive. It has met the advanc
ing needs of our expanding country, and our
nati ma! development, under the inspiration of
its policies, challenges the admiration and the
wonder of the world. It has had convictions
and it has bad the moral courage to proclaim
them.
Fellow Citizens: You do well to celebrate
the anniversary of the birth of the Republican
party within the Empire State, for it has done
more for human freedom than any other po
lttical agency since the Pilgrims landed upon
Plymouth Rock. j
All honor to you venerable gentleman who
fifty years ago stood at the cradle of the Re
publican party. It required resolution of a
bigh order to renounce your old political alle
giance and align yourselves with the forces
which assembled under the banner of Republi
canism. You were obliged to encounter hate,
prejudice,- criticism and epithet. But these did
not stay your purpose. You and your Immor
tal compatriots enlisted In a holy cause. You
sought the north star of human liberty and
turned neither to the- right nor to the left.
Opposition did. not dissuade you. It but drove
deeper Into your hearts the roots of your ex
alted purposes. The Republican party did not
organize for spoils. It assembled about an al
tar of sacrifice and in a sanctuary beset by
enemies. .x

PR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
HOW TO HOLD A HUSBAND.
The best, known (ruide to married happi- .
Bess is to hold the husband as you won the
loverâ by cheerfulness of disposition, pa-
tience and keeping your youthful looks.
Of course a freat many women are handi-
capped by those ills to which womf n are
heir. The constantly reoorrinjf troubles
which afflict her are apt to canse a sour
disposition, nervousness and a bectouded
mind.
Dr. R.V. Pierce, the specialist in woman's
diseases, of Buffalo, N. Y., after a lone ex-
perience in treating such diseases, found
that certain, roots and herbs made into
a liquid extract, would help the" majority
of cases.. This he called Dr. Pierce r s Fa-
vorite Prescription. Thousands of women
have testified to. its merits, and it is put
up in shape to, be easily proettred and
is sold by all medicine dealera. , This is
a potent tonic for the womanly system.
So mnch faith has Dr. Pierce in its merits
thai he offers $500 reward for. any case of
Leucorrhea, Female Weakness, Prolapsus,
or Falling of Womb, which he ; cannot

Erroneous reports sent out as to the
conduct of K. Uyeno, the local Consul
for Japan, in his interviews with Col
lector of the Port Stratton on the ar
rival of the Lena have placed tne
foreign official in a very unpleasant
light. It has been alleged against him
that he made a hot demand that the-
Russian cruiser be ordered to leave
forthwith and that when he learned
of the representations of Captain Ber
linsky as to the unseaworthiness of the
boilers followed with a ridiculous de
mand that a commission of local Jap
anese be authorized to Inspect the
vessel.
These reports were utterly without
foundation, as was learned by Investi
gation at the time. Consul Uyeno
merely sought information from the
Collector, and not being a diplomatic
representative undertook no step as
such.
The Japanese Minister at Washing
ton telegraphed the Consul as to the
reports and was informed that they
were groundless. To set Consul Uyeno
right before, the world Collector Strat
tcn voluntarily sent the following
communication to him:
UNITED STATES CUSTOMS SERVICE,
Port of San Francisco, SÂ«pt. 13, 1904.
Hon. K. Uyeno, Consul of Japan, 420 Cali
fornia street, city â Dear Sir: I have noticed
from the prees certain statements purporting
to give, by Indirection, tha substance of cer
tain Interviews between us relative to the
Rurolan auxiliary cruiser Lena. Attempt Is
being made to convey the Impression that you
made demands upon . me which were met by
terse or summary dismissal on my part. Fur
ther, that there had been warm sessions be
tween us regarding the matter.
I now desire to disavow any such statements
and to declare that In all*- respects, as you
are well aware, not only were our conversa
tions marked by courtesy, but by a friendly
spirit," not only on my part, but on yours as
well. Nothing, occurred of the nature 6ug
gested In some of the publications, and In fact
my very frtrong recollection of our conferences
was that you acted with politeness and dig
nity In asking for Information, and made no
summary demands euch as had been indi
cated.
CONSUL IN FALSE LIGHT.
ities have directed Collector Stratton
to oo-operate with Rear Admiral Good
rich. To that end the Collector yester
day forwarded by Special Deputy Col
lector W. B. Hamilton to Rear Admir
al Goodrich on the flagship New York
a copy of instructions he had received.
The San Francisco officials feel satis
fied that no decision will be satisfac
tory to the Russians, as to the ultimate
time limit that will be allowed them
in which to repair, and that they will
accept, the only other alternative of
dismantling. It is considered a positive
certainty that the Lena is unfit to go
to sea and that she cannot be made
ready within a limit of thirty days
or so, to the satisfaction of her com
mander.
"The Ministry of Marine tells me,- re
garding the arrival of the Russian
transport Lena at San Francisco, that
another vessel, the Korea, is also due
at an American port on the Pacific.
Orders have been sent to the Russian
ships to scrupulously conform with the
American neutrality rules, which are
expected to permit them to take
enough coal "to reach Vladivostok. I
consider the situation very delicate, as
there is evidence that the ships were
destined to prevent" the transport of
contraband goods from the United
States to Japan, and perhaps capture
vessels carrying contraband."
PARIS, Sept. 14.â The correspondent

CRUISER KOREA IS COMING.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. L4.â H. M. S.
Graf ton, flagship of the Pacific squad
ron, which left here some days ago
to do her annual heavy gun practice
at Comox, returned unexpectedly to
Esquimau early Tuesday morning,
making tha. trip from Comox to her
Esqulmalt moorings under forced
draught in record time.
The cause of the Graf ton's record
breaking trip from Comox is connected
with the sudden appearance of the
Russian armed auxiliary cruiser Lena
in San Francisco.
It is understood the Grafton ls under
cabled "orders from the British ad
miralty to protect British shipping on
the American side of the Pacific at
all costs. It depends upon the decision
of the United States Government re
garding the Lena whether the Grafton
v/ill proceed south to watch her, and,
if any British merchantmen are mo
lested, capture and sink her.

ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 14.â The
Eir.percr has- received the following
dispatch from General Stoessel, com
mander cf the Russian miltary forces
at Port Arthur, dated August 28:
"I am happy to report to your Maj
esty that at 3 o'clock in the morning of
Aug-usf 27. during a violent rain and
thunder storm, the Japanese again at
tempted to capture our left flank posi
tions, near No. 1 Fort and Udan Moun

pulsed. Our losses were smallâ three

eight men wounded. The wounded
were brought in and are being care
fully attended. A number of Japanese
corpses would have been picked up by
us, but the enemy prevented us from
eo doing by opening fire on the hospi
tal attendants, r.ho had been sent out
under the Red Cross flag."
Another dispatch from General
Etoessel to the Emperor, dated Septem
ber 2, says:
"On the nisht of September 1 the
enemy attacked Visokaya and Dlin
naya Mountains and the neighboring
fortifications, opening simultaneosly an
artillery fire on the forts and moun
tains. The leading files of the enemy,
Â¦with the Japanese columns behind
them, were discovered in good time,
and our batteries opened on them. The
leading files finally encountered some
automatic mines and many of the
enemy were blown into the air. The
attack was repulsed in an hour. Our
losses were inconsiderableâ one officer
and seven men wounded."

tions seems to be moving eastward.
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
MUKDEN, Sept. 14. â The Japanese
are causing a sensation among the na
tives of Manchuria as they advance
by 'establishing their own system of
taxation and administration, as
though the country were actual Jap
anese territory. They are paying for
supplies with promissory notes on the
war fund, a blanket note being given
for the payment of each village on the
basis of population, leaving the resi
dents to divide pro rata. Few of
the.se notes have yet been collected in
cash, but Japanese officials are col
lecting cash tax levied ,"for war ex
penses." They have even notified the
Governor of Mukden to discontinue
the salt tax, as it will be readjusted
upon a Japanese basis. They have al
most doubled the customs duties at
Yinkow and have placed such a heavy
tax upon the thousands of boats sail
ing thence as practically to paralyze
trade.
Much bushwhacking is going on on
the road south of Mukden and many
Russian soldiers have been killed
from the fields of Chinese corn. How
ever, the corn harvest will soon be
gin and when the fields are cleared
the country will be much more- suit
able for military operations.
FIGHT ON KAMTCHATKA.
Japanese Invade Peninsula and Are
Expelled by Russian Force.
PETROPAVLOVSK, Kamtchatka,
Tuesday, Sept. 13.â In the middle of
June Lieutenant Gundusl of , the Japa
nese navy, with 150 naval reserve men,
landed on the west coast of Kamt
chatka, plundered villages, expelled In
habitants and issued proclamations de
claring the sovereignty of Japan over
the Kamtchatka "peninsula. A sailing
vessel with 100 Russian reserve men
and a detachment of 100 militiamen
was sent from Petropavlovsk to the
west coast to eject the Japanese. The
Russians defeated the latter and cap
tured their leader..
The Russian force lost one man and
had four men wounded. The Japanese
lost seventeen men killed. The Russian
naval detachment later burned five
Japanese schooners, killing seventy
Japanese.
MORE TROOPS FOR FAR EAST.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept! 14.â The
mobilization of troops at Odessa affects
the Fourteenth and Fifteenth divisions
of the Eighth Army Corps. The Four
teenth is famous in the Russian army
as Diagomiroff's division. With it he
crossed the Danube In 1887 and held
Shipka Pass against a Turkish army of
70,000 men. The Fifteenth division has
for several :years contributed the Rus
sian detachment of troops stationed in
the island of Crete.
Lieutenant General Myloff, who will
command the Eighth' Corps, is a Cau
casian, with a long war record. The
corps will proceed to the front at once.
"Precautions were taken on Septem
ber 3 and 4 to prevent a turning move
ment from the east. The Japanese â¢ to
the southward took no vigorous initia
tive, but General Kurokl assumed the
offensive to the eastward. Our detach
ments holding positions at Talienko
sustained a furious night attack, which
was particularly desperate on Septem
ber 5. We retained our position, but
suffered heavy losses, one regiment,
which bore the brunt of the fighting,
losing H00 in killed and wounded.
"By evening of September 5 the dan
ger of a "simultaneous attack on our
front and left flanks had'disappeareo.
The removal of our artillery,- transport
and baggage trains j was . effected in th&
face of immense, difficulties/; but was
successfully concluded. ' Our retirement
on Mukden on September "7 Vascov-'
"By that time Orloff's detachment
was within a mile and a third of our
other forces. Orloff himself was
wounded, as was General Fomin, who
subsequently died.
"After the evacuation of this posi
tion, which had been intended to serve
as a base for our attack, the Japanese
extended northward and occupied the
whole range of hills and the Yentai
mines. SamsonofTs sotnia of Cossacks
dismounted and defended our positians
with the utmost courage, but were
gradually driven back.
"The enemy was now established in
an extremely strong position on the
hills and it would have been too haz
ardous for our left flank to attack
them in view of the losses sustained
in the previous five days. We therefore
v.ithdrew to the village of Talienko
and I decided to retire to Mukden, the
retreat being accomplished on Septem
ber 7. The evacuation of Liaoyang be
gan and was concluded on the
morning of September 4.' All our
equipment was removed, but there was
no time to save the commissariat re
serves, which were sufficient to last
the whole army eight days. These
were all destroyed. The pontoon
bridges were dismantled and carried
off by the troops, while temporary pon
toons were burned and the railway
bridge wrecked. The army retired in
perfect order. The enemy attempted
to pursue, but were repulsed.
SUITERS HEAVY LOSSES.
"As soon as the left flank in the vi
cinity of the Yentai mines, on Sep
tember 2 (Orloff's detachment), occu
pied the heights to the north of the
mines, holding a strong position facing
south, he opened fire with two bat
teries and engaged the enemy in an ar
tillery duel. Orloff's right flank was
then four miles from the left flank
and the remainder of the army. In
order to aid our troops holding posi
tions near Sykwantun, Orloff sent part
of his force from the hills and attack
ed the enemy in the direction of the
village of Sakhomoon. This move
ment was carried out in cornfields. Our
men met with a frontal and a flank
fire, and, losing their bearings in the
ccrnfields, began to retire. The troops
remaining In the hills also retired west
ward, r -
"I adopted the following plan of
operations: Having crossed to the
right bank of the river, the army had
taken up a position between the vil
lage of Sykwantun and heights near
the Yentai mines, which it was in
tended to occupy with all our detach
ments, composed of thirteen battalions.
Taking the position near Sykwantun
as a pivot. It was intended that the
a'rmy effect a movement to flank the
Japanese positions, which extended
from the Taitse river toward the Yen
tai collieries. Offensive operations be
gan when all the troops had taken up
their allotted positions.
"The night of September 1 the com
mander of the corps on the right flank
sent a dispatch stating that, the Japa
nese having taken the offensive and
ad\*anced to and occupied the district
northwestward of our Sykwantun posi
tion, which was of great importance to
up, the Russian regiment holding the
district was forced to retire, and I was
obliged to change my plans in order to
retake the lost ground the following
day.
"It was not untU the evening of Sep
tember 2 that the entire mountain vil
lage of Sykwantun was in our hands.
At first our attacks did not succeed,
but the fighting was continued with
unabated vigor even after darkness had
set In. We repeatedly gained posses
sion of the heights, but were finally
compelled to withdraw temporarily.
Many of our detachments became
mixed up, and in the disorder unity of
command was rendered very difficult.
Leaders of individual detachments,
however, continued the attacks time
after time, and at last succeeded in oc
cupying the desired position, thereby
attaining the object of the operations
on our right flank. J
ORLOFF'S MEN* FALL BACK.
"During August 31 it could clearly be
seen that a considerable force of Gen
eral Kuroki's army had crossed the
right bank of the Taitse River. Owing
to attacks on our left on August 30
and Cl, it was supposed that the main
body of Kuroki's army had been held
off to turn the left flank of our position
and attack our line of communication.
In consequence I resolved to withdraw
the advance troops to the main posi
tion and concentrate a large force
against Kuroki's army and attempt to
hurl him back on the Taitse River.
Only at certain points was this carried
out successfully. *
"At nightfall, undisturbed by the
Japanese, we commenced the evacua
tion of our advanced positions, which
already had rendered great service in
weakening the enemy by enormous
losses. Thanks to the sufficient num
ber of bridges and the manner in which
the roads led out, all troops destined
to take the offensive were safely on
the right bank of the river on the
morning of September 1. The enemy
did not occupy our abandoned ad
vanced positions until the evening of
September 1, when they opened an ar
tillery nre on Liaoyang. No trophies of
war fell into the hands of the enemy.
PLANS TO FLANK KUROKI.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 14.âGen
eral Kuropatkin's official report,
which was given out to-night, comes
as a considerable relief, as setting at
rest alarmist stories of the loss of
gTins, the cutting off of divisions and
the death or capture of prominent
commanders. The report describes in
detail the phases of the battle of
Liaoyang and entirely bears out the
declaration of the press at the time
that General Orloff's failure to hold
the vital position at Yentai was re
sponsible for the breaking down of
all of General Kuropatkin's plant' of
battle and turned a potential victory
into defeat. The report, In part, fol

PARIS, Sept. 15. â The correspondent
at St. Petersburg of the Echo de Paris
says:
"I learn authoritatively that Viceroy
Alexieff asked to be relieved of the
functions of commander in chief on
land and sea of the Russian forces In
the Far. East, but not of those of Vice
roy, his object toeing to avoid giving a
semblance of consistency of the reports
of antagonism between himself and
General Kuropatkin.
"He asked that he be allowed to
continue to be responsible for the po
litical and diplomatic administration
of the Far East and remain at Harbin.
The Emperor granted this request and
therefore General , Kuropatkin will be
solely responsible for military opera
tions there." Q â¢
LONDON, Sept. 15.â The Daily Mail's
correspondent with General Kuropat
kin's fenny writes under date of Sep
tember 8 - an Interesting analysis of
Russian strategy to the eve of the
battle of Liaoyang, bestowing the
highest praise upon Kuropatkin's skill
ful handling ,and withdrawal of the
weak, scattered Russian forces without
demoralization â without, in fact, suf
fering the army to even understand
that it was being withdrawnâ and thus
repairing blunders due to Viceroy's
Alexieff's ignorance and General Stak
elberg's wild southward adventure,
forced by the superior authority of the
Emperor. The correspondent says:
"It is too early as yet to speak of
the appalling and almost inconceivable
difficulties that faced Kuropatkin dur
ing the first phase of the campaign.
Some day it will be known how many,
or rather how few, troops, he had when
he arrived ' in Manchuria, and what
proportion, or . rather disproportion,
were keen, ardent young soldiers of
Russia. Russia will know how far Si
berian levies were equipped and quali
fied for the task' they had to perform,
and when the facts are known the
world will realize the enormous respon
sibility cast upon this silent, resolute
man, and with what strength, silence
and resolution he faced and conquered
it."

Oakland's chief executive does not
believe in women carrying weapons
more deadly than hat pins, therefore
he declined to Issue the permit, al
though the application was accom
panied by the regular fee of $2.
As a consequence of Mayor Olney's
decision Mrs. Porter will 'be forced
to depend upon her skill with the
razor in case of an attack, or else to
secure the services of a body guard.
Although a woman may be fully
capable of wielding: a razors her abil
ity in this direction does not by any
means qualify her to use a pistol.
This is evidently the opinion of Mayor
Olney. who refused to-day to grant to
Mrs. Florence Belle Porter, Oakland's
"only lady tonsorial artist," permis
sion to carry a concealed weapon for
her own protection. . Mrs. Porter al
leged that her husband, Charles Por
ter, also a barber, has made sundry
threats to do her bodily harm and.
while she believes that the tools of
her trade are all right in their way,
she has little faith in the razor as a
weapon of defense, much preferring
the typical weapon of the Western
wilds, the revolver. . Â«Â»Â»Â» ,

Gillett (Kep.) received 21,263 votes
Thomas S. Ford (Dem) 19,696, M E*
Shore (So.) 810 and W. O. Clark (Pro)
362. Mr. Gillett has served the people
of his district with so much ability and
fidelity that his re-election by an in
creased majority is generally pre
dicted. It is clearly understood, how
ever, that Caminetti's candidacy will
impart life and vigor to the contest
Doubtless the Republican State Cen
tral Committee will put forward spe
cial effort to secure the full registration
of Republican voters in the First.
Caminetti is acquainted with many
of the voters in the mining counties of
the district, but he is not very well
known in the northwestern region of
the First, counties composing the
district* are: Dei Norte. Humboldt.
Slskiyou, Trinity, Tehama. Shasta,
Modoc, Lassen, Plumas, Sierra, Ne
vada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador,
Calaveras, Alpine, Mono, Mariposa and
Tuolumne. The area of the district is
greater than that of the entire State of
Pennsylvania.

Thomas J. Geary of Sonoma and E.
J. Llvernash of San Francisco con
ferred with Mr. Caminetti at Demo
cratic headquarters last evening.
At Democratic headquarters in this
city last night Mr. Caminetti, in speak
ing of the pressure j brought to bear
upon him, said:
Tes. my decision Is final. I am In the fight,
and I will not change my mind after I get
home. The Democratic, party and my friends
in the old Second District supported me with
loyalty when, as a young man, I sought po
litical recognition. They elected me to the
Assembly three times, to the State Senate for
one full term and to Congress for two term*.
I have received very many letters importuning
me to accept the nomination for Congress in
the First. A sense of duty. to my party Impels
me to accept this leadership. In the campaign
throughout the district I shall support the
principles of the Democratic party, but will
avoid personalities. 1 have no thought of at
tacking the President's personality. I shall
devote my arguments mainly to the mining
and agricultural Interests of the district. No,
I was not urged by M. F. Tarpey, national
commltteeman of the Democratic party, to take
the nomination for Congress. I have not seen
Mr. Tarpey since his return from the East.
CAMiNErrrrs views.
The announcement ..of CaminettTs
candidacy last evening: created much
comment in political circles. The Re
publicans recognize that he is the
strongest man in the Democratic col
umn. The nomination was tendered to
him at Santa Cm last month by the
First District Democratic convention,
but he declined to accept it then, on
the ground that he could not afford tha
time or expense that would be involved
in making a campaign in a district so
large as the First. Since that time he
has been importuned by his Democratic
friends to enter the race. The fact
was represented to him that no other
candidate could be found to lead the
party. Hence the Amador statesman
reluctantly consented to go on the
ticket. . Â¦'.: .
A. Caminetti of Amador County has
consented to lead the Democratic for
lorn hope in the First Congressional
District in opposition to J. N. Gillett,
the able and popular nominee of the
Republican party.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Sept. 14.
The importance of the passage of the
bond Issue was presented to East Oak
landers this evening at Cameron Hall
and men whose names carry much
weight with the residents of that sec
tion of the city addressed the meeting.
Professor L. D. Inskeep was elected
chairman and introduced the various
phases of the bond proposition, with
the men who devoted their attention to
elucidating the different questions con
tained in the call.
Hugh Hogan was called upon and
unqualifiedly gave his indorsement to
the scheme, and in speaking upon the
general subject, said:
.. The people of East Oakland should one and
all vote for every proposition contained In the
call for this election. It means the wiping
out of an eyesore below the Twelfth-street
dam. It means the purchase of the Bather
Tract for a beautiful park.. We In East Oak
land are peculiarly Interested In theee things,
and In the Polytechnlo High School and the
completion of a sewer system. Besides these
things, every park site improves the general
appearance of the city and to that extent adds
to its attractiveness. This Induces home
eeekers and settlers to come and live here
and will make this city a desirable one In
which to reside.
Dr. E. R. Sill spoke of the benefit
generally to the health of jthe city de
rived from public squares and from
such a lake as Lake Menitt. He urged
the improvement of that body of water.
He said that in a recent trip through
the East he had noticed that all of the
most prosperous cities were spending
large sums for general improvements
and urged the passage of every one of
the propositions to be submitted.
Councilman Meese addressed the
meeting and outlined the general
scheme proposed in the bond issue and
was followed by Councilman Wallace,
who explained the benefits of an im
provement needed in the Polytechnic
High School.
F. A. Stearns directed the attention
of the audience to the fact that,
mathematically figured out, the cost
of the tax would be 31 cents on $100,
and that the cost of trips to Golden
Gate Park spent yearly by the people
of Oakland would pay the entire tax
on the bond issue.
Captain C. A. Welch was in favor of
improvements generally, as were J. W.
Evans, Henry Dodge and Edwin
Stearns of the Board of Trade.
The meeting was well attended and
the people by their, generous applause
showed their sympathy with the speak
ers in what' they said. Â¦
Duped Into marrying a man who
posed as a mining millionaire, . and
who under the laws of California com
mitted bigamy when he wedded his j
second victim within a year, Mrs. Car
rie F. Cox, who bears the name of
Richard Gage, departed to-night for
Chicago, after satisfying herself that
she had been deceived by a wily old
scoundroL
Gage abandoned his Chicago spouse,
as he did jo. pretty girl of Oakland,
Alma Natalie Schmidt, whom he wed
ded last January. In Oakland he posed
as Frederick Page, and he won the
young woman by "plausible stories of
fortune, which dissolved like fog be
fore the morning sun when a bunch of
hard-hearted creditors swooped down
upon him.
The stories of the deluded women
are almost identical. Mrs. Cox | met
Gage (or Page) at Los Angeles, after
he had fled from Oakland to escape
prosecution on a charge of threatening
to kill his young bride, whom he mar
ried in this city on January 6. As
Richard Gage, a mining magnate of
Colorado, he won favor in the sight of
Mrs. Cox, a widow of eleven years'
standing and about 50 years old. Gage
Is at least ten years older, but is &
finely preserved specimen of physical
manhood. To Denver Gage accom
panied Mrs. Cox, where they were mar
ried on July 12. The Oakland wife ob
tained an interlocutory decree of di
vorce March 18. The Denver marriage
Is therefore bigamous, for the year has
not elapsed before a final decree of di
vorce can be entered.
After the marriage Gage and his new
wife went to Chicago on a visit to Mrs.
â¢Cox-Gage's relatives. Subsequently
they spent a short time at Geneva
Lake, Wis., where Gage drank 6O heav
ily that there was complaint from his
wife. Thereupon, runs the deceived
widow's story, Gage threatened to kill
her and struck his spouse, afterward
disappearing. This was identical with
hie conduct toward his Oakland wife.
Later Gage and his wife met in Chi
cago, but the husband suddenly left
for Denver. Gage had telegraphed for
her to join him there, but could not
be found by his pursuing wife. She
continued her journey to Oakland to
examine the contents of a safe deposit
box at the Central Bank, said by Gage
to contain $140,000 in gold coin. Armed,
with the box key and a will Gage had*
made in her favor, Mrs. Cox-Gage waa
allowed to ODen the box.* â¢ -
There wasn't a dollar In the vault.
Nothing but thousands of mining com
pany blank stock books, worthless but
for the value of the paper. Blocks of
stock certificates covering issues
of 20,000 and 30,000 shares each were
piled into the box. Satisfied now that
she had been victimized, Mrs, Cox-Gage
appealed tp the Chief of Police for
further light on her spouse's record.
The court's dockets showed it to a
certainty and her description fitted
the Frederick Page of the record to a
certainty.
Gage or Page appeared In Oakland
late in 190S and figured along the street
as a well-to-do mining man. Of .Impos
ing presence and engaging manners,
he made such an Impression that the
exposure ' of his financial misdealings
was a surprise to many people. He con
quered pretty Miss Schmidt, who was
a clerk in a delicatessen shop at Seven
teenth street and Â¦ Telegraph avenue.
But her wakening came soon. Page
drank to excess. Creditors began pro
ceedings against him. Deputy Sheriff
Jeff Scanlan attempted to serve sum
mons on him and found his man in a
dangerous mood at his rooms. The
police were compelled to break in and
arrest Page, after his wife had fled
In alarm. Â¦
Page deposited $55 ball and fled be
fore ' the examination was set. Mrs.
Page was induoed to dismiss the charge
against him in order that the creditors
might attach the ball money, which
they did, getting a pro rata division.

Pickpockets who managed to dip Into
the pockets of a large number of per-
Bons In attendance at the annual ses
sion of the Grand Lodse of the Por
tugese society of the I. D. E. S. at
Haywards to-day created great excite
ment, and a man giving the name of
A. J. Morton la now under arrest in
the County Jail here, charged with be
ing one ot the men who operated in the
crowd. A number of strangers were
stopped and searched, but as money
was all that had been taken, to Identi
fy that which had been stolen was an
impossibility.
The occasion was an ideal one for
the light fingered gentry. A barbecue
at which nearly 3000 were gathered was
the order of the midday hour. A bar
at which free beer was dispensed was
much frequented and crowding and
jostling resulted. In this throng It is
thought three men worked together,
and, from the complaints made, must
have cleaned up several hundred dol
lars. Andrew Johnson says he lost a
buckskin bag with $120 in it. Manuel
Foster lost $25.
When It became noised abroad that
thieves were at work in the throng
there was a general scattering, then a
searching of pockets to see if their
money was safe. Every now and then
one would find that he had been rob
bed and the indignation grew apace.
The scene of the barbecue was, at the
end of the electric line and in the town
proper Morton was identified by Attor
ney F. J. Lemos as a man he had seen
pushing his way through the people
at the barbecue, and Marshal Shelling
took him Into custody. This afternoon
he was brought to the County Jail to
aKvait examination. Morton had $300
in his pocket, but nothing further to
connect him with the pickpockets.
The meeting of the order was a suc
cessful one. In the morning there was
a parade, following which came the
barbecue. In. the afternoon speeches
were made by Mayor Charles Heyer.
P. J. Crosby, Grand President F. J.
Rose, A. M. Martin of TVatsonville, and
F. J. Lemos. The chefs at the barbe
cue were Peter Morrillo, N. Frye and
Joseph Godell.

ADOPTS NOVEL METHOD.
Voters whose names appear in the
last issue of the great register need
not re-register in order to vote at the
bond election on Tuesday, September
27, except in cases where the voter has
changed his place of residence since
registering. Deputy District Attorney
T. W. Harris has answered the Ques
tion as to the necessary qualifications
of voters in the bond election in the fol
lowing manner:
The general !aw In the tÂ«ection referring to
municipal electiona states that at any munici
pal election voters registered in the last reg
ister published thall be qualified to vote. This
would seem to chow that re -registration Is not
necessary to vote for the bonds exoept for
those who have removed from their place of
residence as entered in the old register.
This, of course, does not apply to the elec
tion of next November, for which all voters
must re-rcclEter.
The press and literary committee of
the. Progress Federation Bond Cam
paign Committee has adopted a novel
method of proving to the satisfaction
of the average voter that the proposed
bftnds for the improvement of the city
of, Oakland should be carried. The
committee communicated with the
Mayors of 100 cities, inclosing a printed
f(/rm containing a number of questions
as to the bonded indebtedness of
municipalities and other matters per
taining to the issuance of improvement
bonds. The first five questions asked
â¢were:
:i â To what extent is your city now bonded
for public improvement bonds?
<2â How is this bonded indebtedness divided,
under the beads of:
Streets and eewers?
Parks an<l boulevards?
.Playgrounds?
Public buildir.es?
a â Would your people vote more, or less
rcadilj-. because of their experience, on bonds
lor fnrthtr improvements?
4 â How has the issuance of bonds affected
property assessments?
6 â What fncn.-a-Â«e or decrease in the normal
tax has resulted from the issuance of bonds?
Answers to these communications
have been received from the ex
ocutive heads of about seventy-five cit
ies, of which number only three were
unfavorable to the issuance of bonds
for public improvement.
I INDEBTEDNESS OF CITIES.
The bonded indebtedness of New
Tork on January 1, 1903, was $461,033,-
TÂ«. The fact that this great indebted
ness has not in any way affected the
prosperity of America's metropolis is
one of the best possible proofs that
Oakland will not be injured by the is
suance of improvement bonds.
A short time ago the bonded Indebt
edness of Boston was JS8.H9.106, and
the citizens of that city have recently
voted to issue bonds for $6,617,200.
The bonded indebtednes of Philadel
phia was $56,337,245, until last July,
when by popular vote it was decided to
increase this amount by $16,000,000.
The Mayor of Cincinnati says that
the bonded indebtedness of that city is
nbw $24,723,000, and ire states that the
people of Cincinnati would not be any
less ready to vote for an additional
issue of bonds as a result of past ex
peri erjee.
After receiving these figures and
facts regarding improvement bonds,
the press committee says:
By the experience of the cities mentioned
and by that by scÂ«<res of others, Oakland may
Â¦wfcll be guided. There in certainly no instance
en record where a public park or a boulevard
haa been abandoned or the purchase of the
land necessary regretted. On the contrary, the
cry has been for more and more of these re
quirements for the growth of communities.
The wise and full use of its bonding capacity
Tcay fairly be taken as an index of a city's
progressive and enterprising character. The
lire merchant uses hiÂ« credit to expand bis
business; the live city, likewise, uses its
credit to make itself jnore aura.ctlve-*-tbat is,
to Increase Its growth and bo add to its wealth
and prosperity.
TRESS COMMITTEE PROGRESS FEDER
ATION.
A general meeting of the Progress
Federation will be held at the Board of
Trade room to-morrow evening for the
purpose of receiving the reports of its
cdmmittees on the progress of the bond
campaign.

OAKLAND, Sept 14.â Since the Oakland
.Club has moved into Its present commodious
tnd comfortable quarters at Maple Hall it
eeems to be growing in popular favor, the
meetings being much ' better attended. The
-current literature section" held forth at the
club to-day and the usual array of eilken
gowns was varied by the presence of several
frock coats. The gentlemen were well repaid
for thus bravely invading a woman's club, for
the programme was unusually interesting and
enjoyable. The chief feature of the day's en
tertainment was the reading by Charles Keeler
of selections from his own recently published
book, "Ellin Songs of Sunland." Mr. Keeler,
though lacking the long hair usually associated
with poets, is a typical dreamer in appearance,
tall and slender, with dreamy eyes that light
pleasantly when he smiles. His "songs" ara
rung in a language that old and young may
understand and enjoy, though a serious thought
frequently underlies' the mirthful rhyming.
Mra. E. J. Bartholomew sang a brilliant
"Staccato Polka" by Mulder, responding to an
enthusiastic encore with "Forbidden Music,"
by Gasteldon. She was accompanied by Mrs.
liachrach of Berkeley.
Carl Cutting also sang two songs, "Tha
Dreammaker," by Nevin, and "The Boston
Cat." by Holcomb.
Mrs. Florence Hardiman Miller Is curator of
the current literature section and Mrs. F. A.
Dorsas was presiding hostess to-day, assisted
by Mrs. GeorgÂ« Humphreys; Mrs. McMath and
Miss H. Whltton.
Tha musicals which was to have taken place
at the Home Club next Friday for the benefit
of the Social Settlement haa been postponed for
two weeks, in deference to the family of S. T.
Alexander, whose death has been ', a sad blow
to bis many friends here. Mr. Alexander was
one of the Settlement's moat Interested and
generous benefactors, the present school build
ing cwlng Its existence to his munificence.
The muslcale will take place at the Home
Club on Friday afternoon, September 30, and
the splendid programme will probably attract a
large crowd. Mrs. Annia Montague Turner,
Sebastian Lot of Honolulu, Fred Hotallng, Dr.
Hodolph and Alfred McKlnnon will participate
and the list Is surely a promising one. Then
the usual inconvenience of transferring will bo
dene away with, as special cars will run di
rect from Twelfth street and Broadway to the
clubhouse.
The directors of the Oakland Social Settle
ment Include Mrs. S. T. Alexander, Mrs. C. H.
Gorrill. Mrs. Lewis Tashiera, Mrs. R. H.
Chamberlain, Mrs. E. D. Page, Mrs. S. B.
Cheek, Miss Horton, Miss Playter, Miss Alex

The Johnson home In Clarexnont was the
scene of the wedding, which was a very quiet
affair, attended by a few lntlmato friends and
relatives.
In the subdued light of hundreds of Jap
anese lanterns t"se Unity Club enjoyed a few
delightful hours last evening In the gardens

liuitly lighted and canvased for dancing, and,
with vocal and Instrumental music, the hours

THE -SAN FRANCISCO CALL; THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1904.
. Precinct registration began yesterday
and will be continued to-day and to
morrow. The day's registration was
rather disappointing. The number of
voters registered in nearly all the pre
cincts is much lighter than at the reg
istration prior to the last election.
In some of the, largest precincts the
registration was extremely light. On
the whole it fell far below the estimate.
" Â¦ To-day is the last of the precinct
registration. The booths are open from
10 o'clock a. m. to 9 o'clock p. m.' Un
less the voters are roused to a sense
of their duty the precinct registration
will be hardly half of what it should
be. ...... . ' _ .

Wyman is accused cf having fraudu

Judge Megan.
More arrests are to follow in the Im
mediate ftflure, it Is said, but the at
torneys for the Merchants' Association
are not ready to prefer the other
charges. Much difficulty has been ex
perienced because the important wit
cesses, the men supposed to have voted
the names of bona ride residents at va
rious polling places, are for the most
part drug fiends and unreliable for the
buildins up a case of prosecution.
They are much of the time in such a
condition that they cannot give intelli

are therefore handicapped in their ef
forts to tet evidence in shape for pres

tion Commlsflnn^rs of eaid city and countv
had duly combined the tt-rrltory of the flrit
and fourth general election precincts of Eald
Thirty-ninth Assembly District then and
there lying contiguous to each other into one
primary election precinct for the purposes of
said primary election anÂ«l had designated and
established tald territory as primary precinct
Xo. 73 and had established caid polling-place
therein for the purposes of said primary elec
tion.
That on the second Tuesday of August, 1901
there waÂ» duly held throughout the city and
county of San Francisco. State of California,
a primary election for the purpose of electing
dele-gates therefrom to all State, district and
local conventions, at which eald city and
county was entitled to representation, there
after to be held ln eaid year 1904 for the pur
pose of making nominations for officers to be
voted for at the next ensuing general election
therein.
That on the 9th day of August. 1904. in thp
city and county of San Francisco, State of
California, the crime of felony, to-wit. fraud
ulent voting at a primary election, was com
mitted to-wit, by Charles Wyman. ln manner
to- wit:
Detective Braig spent the afternoon
in futile search for Wyman, and was
about to start out in, the evening from
the Hall of Justice to resume his ef
forts when he encountered Wyman in
the Central station. The accused had
come to surrender himself, accom
panied by Maestretti and Bpyne, who
had the order of release from Judge
Mogan. Wyman was taken up to the
City Prison and booked, after wh^ich he
was let go on production of the order
by Judge Mogan.
The following Is the complaint pre
ferred by Wheelan before Judge
Cabaniss:
Wheelan was accompanied to the
Hall of Justice in his quest for a war
rant yesterday by George T. Wright,
attorney for the Merchants' Associa
tion, and John A. Hosmer, who has
been employed specially to prosecute
the election fraud cases. There was a
hitch over the technical form of the
complaint, and some time was con
sumed by Assistant District Attorney
Robert Ferral to draw it up anew. It
was sworn to before Police Judge
Cabaniss, who issued the warrant of
arrest and fixed bail at $2000, or $1000
in cash.
SURRENDERS TO OFFICER.
In the frauds. Though their conduct
at the polls has been under investiga
tion, no definite decision had been
reached yesterday, and as to Graney it
appears doubtful wherther any com
plaint will be made. â¢ r

Tigers Win After Thtelman Is Out for
Interference.
PORTLAND, Sept. 14. â Poor ball
at critical moments and a yellow de
cision by Umpire Brown when he
called Thielman out for alleged inter
ference with the backstop at the
plate militated bo strongly against the
Portlands this afternoon that they
lost the initial game with the Tigers
by a score of 4 to 2.
Hurley essayed to catch and as he
is not a good backstop he fumbled
the ball. One run. should have : been
cut off when Lynch collided with
Hurley, knocking the ball out of his

Williams Is Wild and Erratic and
Runs Come Fast.
SEATTLE, Sept. 14.â San Francisco
broke Seattle's winning streak this
afternoon. The Siwashes could not do
anything with "Jimmy the Whale."
With perfect play they would have
been shut out. Leahy gave Seattle
orte Tun by a passed ball and a wild
throw to second. Waldron tried to
catch a low drive to center which he
should Have let go as a single. Instead
he failed to reach the ball and Frisk
circled the bases. Williams' errors
were responsible for three of San
Francisco's runs. In the sixth San
Francisco bunched five hits and went
flying around the bases. Score:

EASY VICTORY FOR UNCLE.
The football season was formally
opened at the University of California
yesterday with a game between the
frvshmen eleven and the Oakland High
School team. It was the freshmen's
game ?t th<Â» end. the score standing
6 to 0. but that does not tell th? whole
talc, for the Oaklanders were not as
hopplessly out of it as that zero would
indicate. * As a matter of fact Oakland
came near scoring twice and once only
a whisker separated H from five points.
If nothing else the game demonstrated
that the Oakland team has a good
change for the championship of the
Academic Football League.
As for the freshmen, the game did
not amount to much. It is too early
in the season and there were too many
of them tried out to get a line on what
they will do. When it comes to mere
bref this year's pquad seems to have
a pood deal more than last year's,
which augurs a good stiff line any
way. The "heady" part of the game
will all be brought out later, and with
puch a trio of coaches as Hopper, Greis
bcrg and Mini, there should be some
good football developed.
About the only man who showed out
above the rest yesterday was Sperry,
the Modesto High School boy. who has
already done something with the
weights on the athletic field. Sperry
has the height and breadth and width
and these, combined with grit and a
good head, seem to make him easily
the best of the squad. There are oth
ers, however, who will ' show better
form as the season advances, among
them Twitchell and Booth at fullback.
Parsons. Brown. Golcher and Snowden
at halfback, all of whom were tried
out.
The freshmen started off well enough
in the game by hitting the line hard at
once. Thev managed to get the ball
o\er the poal line in the flrst five min
utes. This achievement was accom
plished largely through Sperry's
twenty-yard run behind good interfer
ence. After that Riley kicked the goal
and made six points.
This ended the scoring for the day,
the weakness of the freshmen being
due mostly to the frequent changes by
the coaches. At the end of the first
half the ball was in freshmen hands
on the Oakland twenty-yard line. The
fierce play of the Oaklanders kept the
freshmen back and twice they got the
ball by preventing the freshmen from
making; their yards.
In the second half the excitement was
largely augmented by the spectacular
performances of Ghiradelli, the Oakland
quarter, who made two thirty-yard
runs and nearly got over the line.
Kendall stopped Ghiradelli the first
time on the fifteen -yard line. It needed
the whole crowd to do it the second
time. After the flrst run Oakland tried
to kick a goal from the twenty-yard
line, with Captain Bramhall as the
kicker. The ball just missed going be
tween the goal posts by a mite.
The rest of the second half was
foujjht out in the middle of the field,
neither side getting much of an ad
vantage. The line-up of the elevens
was as follows:

CARDINAL FRESHMEN TO PLAY.
Will Line Up for the First Time
Apains* Palo Alto Eleven.
STANFORD, UNIVERSITY. SepL
14. â The first football game of the
season will be played on the Stanford
BTidiron to-morrow afternoon, when
the cardinal freshman team will line
up against the eleven from Palo Alto
High School. There will be no reg
ular freshman team, but every man
on the squad will be given a chance
to play for a few minutes. The show
ing of" the men to-morrow will largely
determine the men who will make up
the first team, which will play the
strong team from Santa Clara Col
lege next Saturday.
The line-up of Palo Alto will be:
Tomasini. fullback; Clark, right half;
Jordan, left half; Fletcher, quarter;
Wagtiey, left end; Gossett. right end;
Burcham. left tackle; Thomas, right
tackle; Tyler, rijrht guard: Arnott,
left guard; Van Ebbea. center.
A short -man aiways likes to stand on
his dignity.
Dunleavy was the first man to take
a wallop at the leather in the sixth.
He lifted it out to left field, and pretty
hard at that. Then along came Mr.
Schlafley. He fouled off about a dozen
and each time he hit it Harder. Finally
he landed right and that ball never
traveled so fast before. Schlafley
paused for a moment at second, but
moved directly when Kruger pushed
another mitt warmer past Mr. Smith's
profile.
Streib must have made a bet that he
would hit the ball harder than . any
man In the league. A good one came
floating up to the pan. Zing! Out to
the flagpole for three sacks. Then
along came Devereaux, Byrnes, Jones
and Ganley, each with a wallop In his
club. Six in all and the game was
really broken up.
The event was a memorable one for
Mr. "Bumpus" Jones. It was the flrst
time he figured as a winner since he
contracted to take money from Uncle
Peter. He pitched fairly good ball, but
would probably have also ran if that
torrent of binglers did not come in
time to save his life. The score f

The Commuters worked off the six
sixty-six combination on Mr. W. Hall
yesterday at Recreatfon Park. 'Twas
an uneventful sort of a struggle and
one that dragged , badly till the great
big explosion was pulled through in the
sixth. It was six runs, six hits and
the sixth spasm. Mr, Hall looked
pretty rocky when he lined up for
work in the first, but his wpeful ex
pression after the sixth would be a
prize winner at any human interest
ehow.

Joe Walcott, "the Barbadoes won
der," will arrive in this city to-night
to prepare himself for his approaching
battle with Joe Gans, to take place
under the auspices of the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club on the 30th inst.
Walcott will be accompanied by his
manager, Billy Pierce of Boston. He
will go into training immediately.
Alex Greggains, manager of the club
promoting the fight, stated last night
that either himself or Billy Roche will
officiate as referee on the night the
two dark skinned whirlwinds hook up.
Greggains added that he would make
it his business to see that the fight is
absolutely on the square. If there is
anything suspicious in the actions of
either man, both will be bustled out
of the ring without further ceremony.
Greggains has practically matched
Mike Sullivan (brother of the Twin)
and Joe Angeli, the well-known native
light weight, for a ten-round go as a
preliminary. This bout in itself should
prove worth the price of admission, as
both men are fighters who believe In
action and are in the habit of making
the pace a fast one.
The regular monthly amateur show
of the San Francisco Club will take
place at Woodward's Pavilion to-mor
row night. A good card has been ar
ranged, including main events between
Dick Hyland and Frank Walsh of Ore
gon, and George Sullivan and Joe
Long, the formidable heavies. Young
Choynskl and Tom Sullivan will also
clash, as will four other well-known
and willing youngsters of various
sizes and weights.
Men familiar with the angles of the
boxing game smiled sarcastically yes
terday when the statement of Rose, the
young athlete, was read. Rose is a
mere stripling when compared with
the herculean proportions of Jeffries.
He has slender underpinnings and two
of his arms would hardly make one of
the fighter's. It is possible Coach Yost
of the University of Michigan Is seek
ing some advertising for Rose, who is
slated for a place on the football
eleven this season.
OWEN G. COLLINS WAS NOT
DISMISSED FRO3I THE ARMY
Journal Makes Error In Reporting
That Officer Was Dropped From
the Service.
The many friends of Second Lieu
tenant Owen G. Collins, Fifth Field
Battery, Artillery Corps, were greatly
surprised at the erroneous announce
ment in the Army and Navy Journal
that he had been dismissed from the
service. The statement was entirely a
mistake and evidently emanated from
the fact that Lieutenant Harry J. Col
l>ns of the Twenty-eighth Infantry had
been court-martialed, found guilty,
and was no longer retained in the
army service. Lieutenant Owen G.
Collins, while a young officer, is highly
esteemed by all the leading officials
in the department here. He graduated
high in his class at West Point and
his position in the army and at his
post at the Presidio at the present
moment is an enviable one.
General MacArthur. accompanied by
Major P. W. West, who is now making
an annual tour of the Government
reservations in and about the Yo
semite Valley, will return to town
next Sunday.

CHICAGO SCOFFS AT ROSE.
Experts Think the Michigan Athlete
Is Playing to the Galleries.
CHICAGO. SepL 14. â The declara
tion of Ralph Rose, the University of
Michigan giant, that he is the only
man in the world who can beat Jef
fries hag opened up a discussion in
the world of boxing that will hold the
experts for a while. The prevailing
opinion among, men who have been
in the game or have followed it for
years is that Rose has overestimated
himself or else is playing to the gal
leries to attract attention for the foot
ball season. Few believe the Michi
gan giant is really sincere in his talk
about the mighty Jeffries, although
there are some who really think Rose
could give the boiler-maker a tough
argument, notwithstanding his lack of
experience in the ring.
Jack Root says all he wants is one
crack at Rose just to show him where
he stands in the prize fight game
Malachi Hogan and Abe Pollack think
Rose would have a show with a few
years' practice. Tommy Mowatt
thinks he could whip Rose himself.
All of a score of experts and fighters
seen to-day laughed at Rose and be
little his statement. Meanwhile Rose
has started football training in Mich
igan and is saying nothing.
Fleeing From His Enemies.
Sven Johnson, a seafaring: man,
while fleeing from his imaginary ene
mies which he thought num
bered several hundred, hid himself in
the hills back of Berkeley for threo
days with a x lonely bottle of whisky
as his sole companion until hunger
drove him over to this city, where ha
was found fighting red devils and bad
men by Officer John McLean at Grove
and Larkin streets yesterday. John
son is now laced in a straitjacket ia
a cell in the detention hospital. When
he recovers he will return to 126 El
lis street, where he usually rooms
when on shore leave.

Trainers Praise Rose's Speed.
NEW YORK. Sept. 14. â In pugilis
tic circles Ralph Rose's den to Jeffries
was much discussed to-day. Except
for a few amateur bouts in his
younger days at his home in Califor
nia, Rose is unknown in the boxing
game. His prowess as an athlete has
gone the rounds of the world. He is
the greatest shot-putter and hammer
thrower in the world. Athletic train
ers who have put him in condition for
field and track events say he is a
marvel of shiftiness and can move
like a panther, despite his great bulk.

NEW YORK, Sept. 14. â The victory
of Memphis in the first race at
Brighton Beach yesterday was a costly
one to Jack Munroe. The Butte miner
has an interest in the book of Harry
Hastings, doing business in the field.
They have been laying odds against
favorites and were caught out of line
on Memphis. They figured Memphis
did not have a chance and laid as high
as 100 to 1 against him. The result
was a disastrous one to the book as
Memphis' victory cost Munroe nearly
all the money he secured from the
Jeffries fight. The book took In several
bets of from $5 to J20 against Mem

In the- second round he shook up

BRIGPITON BEACH, Sept, 14.â Two
daughters of Hamburg ran first and
second to-day in the filly division of
the Produce stakes. Princess Rupert
won, with Rose of Dawn second, H. B.
Duryea had declared- to win with
Princess Rupert, as he desired to save
penalties on Rose of Dawn in other
stakes. Princess Rupert was able to
fulfill Mr. Duryea's trust in her, but
Rose of Dawn could have won by any
number of lengths, Hildebrand having
the great filly under, a tremendous pull
all the way. The feature of the race
was the unremitting efforts of Burns,
on Raiment, to get up to either of the
Duryea fillies, but the Daly filly was
not able to do so.
In the betting the Duryea fillies were
at the prohibitive odds of 2 to 9. In
the separate place betting the ring had
the poor judgment to lay 7 to 10 against
Rose of Da\yn for second place and
they paid for^their temerity. The stake
added nearly $6500 to Mr. Duryea's ac
count, as the second tllly, Rose oÂ£
Dawn, received $1500. The winnings of
the Duryea stable this season are run
ning well up to the neighborhood of
$170,000. With ordinary racing luck it
seems the $200,000 mark may be reached
before the season ends. Nearly all this
will have been achieved with sons and
daughters of Hamburg and of Meddler.

.CHICAGO, Sept. 14.â Ed Corrigan's
four-year-old horse Galba. ,by Major
Richard-Miss Preston, which was
coupled ,in the betting with ! Schwarz
wald in the steeplechase,' the feature
race at Hawthorne to-day, fell at the
ninth jump,- broke, his leg near the
shoulder- and was put to death a few
moments later. Jockey McHpgh, who
rode him, was pinned- under the horse
when he fell and the stable hands had
to help him out. The jockey was badly
cut up about the head, face and
shoulders but no bones were broken..
The Corrigan entry was a hot favorite
at 13 to 10, being backed from 2 to 1.
Schwarzwald was the one relied upon
to do the trick, and rewarded his back
ers handsomely by leading all the way
and winning easily by three lengths.-
S..W. fetreet sprung a surprise when
he put over Magistrate, a Keene cast
off, in the third race. He was outrun
the first part, but, saving ground when
turning for home, he came away hand
ily and won by a length from New
Mown Hay. Magistrate was -held as
high as 20 to 1 in the betting. . A few
wise ones made one of the. biggest kill
ings of the year. The track was in good
shape, the weather cold and the attend
ance light. Summary: - '. .V

While building railroads in Tennessee
some twelve years ago a number of hands
contracted fever and various forms of
blood and skin diseases. I carried S- S. S.
in my commissary and gave it to my hands
with most gratifying results. I can recom-
mend S. S. S. as the finest preparation for
Malaria, chills and fever, as well as all
blood and skin diseases. W. I. McGowajt .
I suffered greatly from Boils, which
would break out on different parts of my
body. I saw S. ,S. S. advertised and after
usine about three bottles I was cured,
and for the last three years have had no
trouble whatever. A. W. Zebex.
217 ReadSL, Evansville, Ind.
I began using your S. S. S. probably ten
years ago for Malaria and blood troubles,
and it proved so good that I have con-
tinued ever since using it as a family
remedy. It is a pleasure for me to recom-
mend S. S. S. for the benefit of others
who are needing a first rate blood purifier,
tonic and cure for Malaria.

Hospital Surgeon Resigns.
TJie board of lady managers of the
Children's Hospital have arranged an
other entertaining programme for this
evening and as the benefit entertain
ment closes to-night the board antici
pates a good, strong rally of the
friends of the institution. Â»
Owing to the success of the children's
entertainment yesterday the board has
decided to hold another children's fete
this afternoon.
The Hebrew Orphan Asylum Band
played selections under the direction
of Mr. Mauser and there were dances
by the Misses Dorothy Walker, Flora
Graver. Katherine Ingis. Mildred Mas
sey, Edith Eiianger. Helen Phelps and
Lottie Horner and Miss Blanche Lyons
rendered a vocal selection.
In the afternoon one of the interest
ins features was the doll contest. The
first prize, a silver loving cup, was
awarded Miss Helen L,eavitt, who car
r!ed a flaxen haired, chubby faced doll,
that won general admiration. The sec
ond prize, a beautiful imported "baby
rose" fan, went to Miss Margaret Car^
rigan and the third prize, also an iirij
ported fan. was presented to Miss Ma?
jorie Fonda. "Dinah," a doll repre
senting a colored girl,' also won a prize
for Dorothy Gardner of Alameda.
The second day of the Children's
Hospital benefit took place yesterday
in Mechanics* Pavilion and the after
noon and evening programmes were
admirable and contained a variety of
amusements all the way from a splen
didly executed exhibition drill by the
Columbia Park Boys' Club, commanded
by Major Sidney S. Peixotto, to acro
batics, wrestling and sparring by mem
bers of the Olympic Club under the
leadership of John, A. Hammersmith.
Australia and as far as can be ascer
tained without placing the vessel on
tbÂ« drydot k, she suffered no damage
while on the beach.
At noon on Tuesday Captain Davis
thought he was eight miles off shore.
The weather was thick and landmarks
that would have enabled him to ascer
tain his position with accuracy were
Invisible. The Ditt^n held on her course
until 7 o'clock p. m.. when Captain
Davis altered the course to east north
east, .^oundinirs were taken at 7:S0
â¢o'clock p. m.. but with 20 fathoms of
line out no bottom was found. At 7:35
o'clock it was again "twenty fathoms
and no bottom." At 8:30 o'clock the
lookout reported "land ahead."
The helm was placed hard to port,
th~ yards taken forward on the port
braces, but the Ditton refused to
change her course. Another heave of
the !-=ad showed only four fathoms of
vater. The starboard anchor was let
pn, the sail? were clewed up and furl
ed and Captain Davis turned his at
tention to securing help.
Blue lights were burned and rockets
sent up. The fog cleared somewhat
and after several hours somebody on
horseback waved a torch from the
I -each. Then came the lifeboat and
afw-r that the tugs.
The Ditton was 74 days coming from
Bound to this port from Newcastle,
Australia, with 41bO tons of coal in her
holds, the Ditton lost her way in the
toe and at 8:30 o'clock Tuesday night
went ashore, broadside on, about five
miles below the Cliff House. Her sig
nals of distress were seen by the life
saving beach patrol and at midnight a
lifeboat was alongside the stranded
vessel. The fives of those aboard the
fÂ»hip were In no immediate danger, so
ihe life savers returned to shore and
notified the towboat companies.
The Spreckeis tug Defiance started
for the scene within five minutes of
the tim" news was received of the dis
aster and was alongside the Ditton be
fore 2 o'clock. The tugs Relief and
Sea Fox followed later.
Before the other boats got there,
however, the Defiance had pulled the
Ditton's nose seaward and when the
tide had risen sufficiently the three
boats made short work of pulling the
Britisher into deey water.
The Ditton is commanded by Cap
tain TV*. Davis, whose wife makes her
home aboard the ship. Mrs. Davis was
Â«slÂ»*ep when the vessel struck and the
striking never stirred her slumbers.
W'hen she went on deck yesterday
morning the vessel was anchored off
BfelSES wharf. Captain Davis told his
â¢wife of t.he night's peril as they break
fasted.
That the British ship Ditton is not
lying in the surf below the Cliff House,
pounding herself to pieces to the dirge
music of the roaring breakers, is due,
first, to the fart that the went ashore
at low crater and second, to the little
time lost by the Spreckeis Towboat
Company in sending assistance.

THE question of the Russian warship has been settled by the
President without ruffling the dignity of Japan or Russia. He
gives her two months in which to make repairs and get out.
and as an alternative she must go now or disarm and lie here till
the dose of the war. Of course she will disarm and rock ingloriously
on the bay until peace comes.
On some grounds it will be regretted that her Government does
notaccept the two months' time for repairs. She could be patched
tip and coaled in that time, and then Japan would have a cruiser
waiting for her outside the three-mile limit, and when they met
there would be a sea fight right off our western water front. There
wonM be standing room only on the hills from Mount Tamalpais to
the Twin Peaks. The Cliff House would look like a bee hive about
to swarm and there would be lively betting on the rounds. It would
be a sight worth seeing, and if the Lena's sailing date were set long
enough ahead San Francisco would have a bigger crowd than came
for the Knights Templar. It is many a^long year since hostile pow
der has been burned near our coasts, except in the Civil War, and
such a fight as might be here would have the zest of novelty, with
the additional pleasure that we could see the show without costing
ct 8 cent in men or ships or powder.
Japan would be willing to do her part in the spectacle, and if
Russia had any regard for the feelings of our people and the Czar

word "go" and furnish' us some real sport.
A New York woman who recently re
turned fronvSt. Louis, where she went
to see the World's Fair, relates this ex
perience:'
"I stayed with one of the old famil
ies,", she 'said, "and the first morning
after my . arrival one of the young
ladies of Â¦ the family asked me if I
would like to join a market party.
"She saw that I was in the dark, and
explained that in St. Louis it was an
antebellum custom for the; mother of
the family to do her own marketing.
They still have the old-fashioned mar
kets there- where you can buy any
thing for the table from *a chicken
liver to. a Quarter of beef or a leg of
mutton. The purchaser was always
accompanied by her servant, who car
ried a' huge basket, into which the
articles were placed.
"My friend informed me that the old
custom was again in vogue, in St.
Louis, except that the daughters, in
stead of the mothers, now do the buy
ing. â¢ â¢ y -
"Well. I submitted, of course, and
we started. On the way we were joined
by others and by the time we reached
the market place the procession was a
block long. ; : : ]'-Â¦<Â¦;
"I asked why, they didn't telephone
their \ orders or have a boy call fo;
them, as we, do in New York. They
said that â¢ was -obsolete in St. Louis!
They.; preferred . to make their own se
lections, â¢ the â¢ chief reason being that
ItYwasja' revival of a tradition, and St.
Louis revels" in tradition.
"And then, ii "this Â»way they always
knew what'the'j; neighbors were going
to have 'for dinner, so that if they were
invited 'out they would : know ; whether
to accept or decline."
THE CASE OF THE LENA.
"Of course they're all women! ' No
man'would have the face to ask a girl
to take things out or glass cases and to
lift down awkward boxes when he did
not Intend to make a purchase. I can
usually tell whether, a woman really
means to buy or is only getting styles:
But, rafter all, I can't tell whether she
may.^or may- not be a shoplifter, so I
have to keep my eyes in the back of my
head while I'm moving about. '/Â¦ Â¦

The beautiful Baroness Hayashl. the
wife of the Japanese Embassador to
London, attended recently a dinner^
party where a Frenchman held the
table spellbound for an hour by an
extraordinary dissertation on Japan.
He described the Japanese mode of
bathing, the Japanese dress, the Jap
anese religion and form of marriage
proposal, the geisha's manner of mak
ing up her lips and eyes and nails â
' In a word, the most intimate secrets of
Japan were exposed and minutely de
scribed by this Frenchman.
He departed early. He had made a
great success. After v he was gone a

ECONOMISTS have not been unmindful of two parallel move
ments affecting the industries of the United States. Neither
has been the cause of the other. Each has proceeded inde
pendently from the same cause. The one that first excited attention
was promoted by capital. Its purpose was, by combination, to de
stroy commercial competition. When that purpose was effected it
was foreseen that commodity values would be controlled by com
bination and would be raised or lowered, in disregard of the law of
supply and demand.
If this system of combination could be left free to overwhelm
competition, the price of all the necessaries of life and of all the
factors of development could be dictated by a few men or by one
man. Of course, in the long run this system would destroy itself by
so affecting general prosperity as to impair consumption. There can
be no general prosperity without freedom. Leave competition free
to act in conjunction with the law of supply and demand, and while
there mil be failures, usually as the result of bad judgment, and not
all who compete in commerce will thrive, yet the far vaster number,
the consumers, will not be injured, and upon their power to consume
depends the average commercial prosperity of the country. All of
this was felt so keenly and was so early appreciated that legis
lation responded to the demand of public opinion. '
The first effort at legislation was the interstate commerce law,
by which restraint was provided upon combination between rail
roads and shippers. The operations of the Standard Oil Company
were the main incentive to that legislation. In its campaign to de
stroy competition that company had found its most powerful in
strument to be the rebates on its shipments, which were denied to
its competitors. The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of
the interstate commerce law, and then followed anti-trust legisla
tion, striking at the commercial combinations. The efficiency of the
two forms of legislation waited for proof until President Roosevelt
furnished it by enforcing the law.
Now the way seems to be open to establish the open shop in
commerce, manufactures and transportation ; in other words, to .re
store reasonable competition. Judicial interpretation has now ac
cumulated to such an extent as to serve as a guide to further leg
islation, if it be needed. President Roosevelt can be relied upon to
recommend, approve and enforce such legislation. His competitor,
Judge Parker, declares that the resources of the common law are
sufficient, without the use of what legislation we have or report to
more. But it must not be forgotten that a common law remedy must
be sought by individuals who have a cause of action. If protection
against combinations and trusts must be sought by an individual,
single-handed, it will be sought in vain.
Judge Parkers plan would be a failure. The combination is
stronger than the individual, in court and out. The Government is
stronger than the combination, and it is the purpose of legislation
to put the Government against the trust and the combine. It will
be observed that legislation has been aimed at only one of the two
parallel movements which have unfavorably affected pur industries
by destroying freedom. National and State anti-trust laws have
been so framed as to exclude labor combinations from their opera
tion. As commercial combinations have enforced the closed shop in
commerce, the labor combinations have enforced it in labor, and have
done it by express exception from the operation of statute law. The
result is that one man might be able to put a price on the necessaries
of life and one man might be able to permit and to prohibit labor.
It amounts to the substitution of the arbitrary will of one man !
for the free action of millions.
A twin system of that kind, which denies freedom of contract,
and liberty to trade or to work, cannot long exist without destroy
ing prosperity. The right to labor is the right to live, and the right
to choose a commercial occupation and follow it, under no other
limitation than reasonable competition, is necessary to harmonious !
development. A free people, desirous of remaining free, must have
the open shop in industry and commerce. Xor must the law play any
favorites. A combination that destroys freedom of commerce is no
more vicious than one that destroys the freedom of labor, and each
must go down, under the necessity for preserving freedom and pros
perity for all. There may be some failures in competition,' but no
system has yet excelled it in the affairs of the world, and it is prob
able that none will, because it means freedom.
THE OPEN SHOP.
Unclaimed dividends on bankrupts'
estates amount to $5,785,000, and such
assurance is felt that claims to the
bulk of it will never be advanced and
substantiated that much of the money
has been appropriated to pay for the
erection of the bankruptcy offices.
Army prize money still undivided
amounted on March 31, 1903, to $363,
96C, an/I that the great bulk of It will
be retained by the Treasury may be
inferred from the fact that during the
year preceding this date only $365 was
paid to soldiers or their representatives
out of this sum. Since 1884 the un
claimed effects of soldiers who have
died while serving their country have
reached the large total of $602,000. Na
val prize money undistributed because
unclaimed foots up $1,350,000.
It has been suggested that an annual
return should be issued giving full par
ticulars of all unclaimed sums of 250
pounds and upward in the various Gov
ernment departments. If this were
done and advertised there is^ little
doubt that much of the money would
be promptly claimed. But the British
Government Is hardly likely to take
any action that will deprive It of such
a considerable source of revenue.
Some people .are still seeking to get
a share of the property left by Mrs.
Helen Blake, who dlpd intestate in 1873.
lit' addition to considerable real estate
she left personalty of the value of
$720,000. For the benefit of such claim
ants it should be stated that they have
not the ghost of a chance of getting
anything, for by an order of the court,
dated 1838, the .crown was declared en
titled to the estates and appropriated
them.
In Scotland intestates' estates await
ing: claimants amount to over $175,000,
of which the crown has a grip on $75,
000.
People who die intestate bring con
siderable money to the crown, as well
as profit to the lawyers. On December
SI last there remained in the hands
of the Treasury $652,435 from Intestates'
estates, of which the crown's share
amounted to over $75,000.
TAKEN' BY" THE CRQWX.
All Government stock and dividends
unclaimed for ten years is transferred
to the National Debt Commissioners.
On March 31 last the balance on this
account amounted to $3,785,583, which
does not include sums previously ap
propriated by the Government. In 1863,
for instance. Mr. Gladstone canceled
$13,000,000 of unclaimed stock. It is
amazing how remiss people are in
claiming dividends, consols and other
Government investments. On April 2
last the dividends "due and not de
manded" amounted to nearly $600,000.
The consolidated fund holds nearly
$200,000, representing interest on South
Sea stock paid to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer between 1845 and 1852, which
has never been claimed.
In the great morgue of litigation and
"expectations" â chancery â funds^ and
estates aggregating in value $273,612,305
are now tied up. But as a fund is not
considered unclaimed until it has been
in court undealt with for fifteen years,
il is impossible to estimate the propor
tion of this colossal sum which belongs
to missing owners. It is certain, though,
that most of them will never get a
penny of it. Funds in chancery in
Ireland amount to $24,392,503. of which
the same statement is equally true.
MILLIONS TIED UP.
LONDON, Aug. 27.â Folk in America
who believe themselves entitled to for
tunes in this country will be interest
ed to hear that according to returns
made during the Parliamentary ses
sion just closed there is now over $321,
000,000 in the hands of the British Gov
ernment, awaiting lawful claimants.
There is small likelihood, however,
that any considerable portion of it will
ever find its way Into the pockets of
the latter. \ This vast sum is retained
by the crown officials because those to
whom it belongs have . not succeeded
in proving their claims to it to the
law'a satisfaction, or, ignorant of
what is due them, have not put in any
claims for It. To get the Government
to give up money it has once got a
tight grip on is a very difficult and
costly matter. For a poor claimant
without the means of defraying the le
gal expenses the chances of obtaining
restitution are well nigh hopeless. It
is, perhaps, therefore, just as well for
their peace of mind that hundreds of
poor people scattered over the world
have no knowledge- that In the British
treasury are large fortunes to which
they are entitledâ provided they can
prove it. If they knew it and under
took to prove it in the great majority
of cases it would simply result in the
lawyers getting what little money they
have. Meanwhile the Government does
not advertise for claimants to any por
tion of the colossal hoard in it3 treas
ury.

Mrs. Gabriellc Cavalsky
Secures Decree as Prayed
lira. W. D. Murphy, who dwells on
Minna street, and her daughter, Mrs.
A. M. McVicker, who resides on Ches
ley street, will be sentenced to-day by
Police Judge Mogan for having dis
turbed the peace last Tuesday Vvening
at Bryant and Chesley streets by scold
ing Mrs. E. Toomey of 42 Chesley
street.
Patrolman W. T. Monahan testified
that he spent seven minutes in futile
efforts to stay the abusive oratory of
Mesdamts Murphy and McVicker, and
that he could not avoid arresting them
without betraying the trust reposed
in him as a preserver of the public
peace. He tried to ascertain the cause
or their oral attack upon Mrs. Toomey,
but it was too complicated for him to
fathom.
Then the court attempted to probe
the depths of the case, but failed to
obtain a coherent story from the nar
ratives of the witnesses examined. All
that was established with any degree
of clearness was a certain visit of Mr.
McVicker, husband of one of the de
fendants, to the home of Mrs. Toomey,
the complainant, and that said visit
brought such Bcandal upon the parties
concerned that Mr. McVicker was de
nounced by his own mother, while both
McVicker and Mrs. Toomey were held
in contumely by the remainder of the
McVickers and also by the Murphys.
Mrs. McVicker and Mrs. Murphy just
happened to meet Mrs. Toomey at Bry
ant and Chesley streets and were au
dibly expressing their opinion of her
character when the patrolman in
tervened and arrested the mother and
the daughter. Query: "Why didn't he
arrest Mrs. Toomey? Answer: Because
Mrs. Toomey did not get a chance to
insert a word edgewise.
That the neighborhood of Bryant and
Chesley streets was deeply interested
in the case found exemplification in the
crowded condition of the courtroom and
the audible murmurs that followed
each important point of the testimony.
The Murphy-McVicker sympathizers
occupied one side of the auditorium,
while the Toomeyltes thronged the.
other. When the Judge pronounced the
defendants guilty the Murphy-McVick
er contingent muttered Its disapproval
end the Toomey adherents Interchanged
congratulatory smiles and handshakes
until Bailiff Hickey's admonitory gavel
drove both clans to the corridor.
Mrs. Georgle Smith and Mrs. Nellie
Raffen are joint occupants of 307
Fourth street, and in Judge Cabaniss'
court It was clearly shown that the
two ladies have not dwelt in neighbor
ly amity. Mrs. Raffen charged Mrs.
Smith with battery that was entirely
unprovoked, while Mrs. Smith declared
that Mrs. Raffen accused her of having
Etolen a newspaper which had been de
livered at the door of the latttr's
apartment. Accompanying the accu
sation. Mrs. Smith averred, was a se
vere blow on the jaw and a kick on
the abdomen â a kick such as the lean
German gives the fat German at
Fischer's Theater. Furthermore, Mrs.
Smith stated, Mrs. Raffen- was intox
icated at the time and to that fact
only could be attributed her hallucina
tion that she had been assaulted. As
neither of the ladies submitted cor
roborative testimony the Judge dis
missed the* case and advised them to
live in different houses.
Stella Monroe, tall, willowy, blonde
and stylishly attired, haughtily in
formed Judge Mogan that for the life
of her she could not ; understand why
nhe was arrested early yesterday
morning at Eddy and Jones streets.
"The charg-e against you is va
grancy," his Honor explained.
"Vagrancy?" exclaimed the defend
ant. "How preposterous! The idea is
perfectly absurd. A lady can go out
to dine alone without provoking arrest,
can't she?"
"As my late dining is always with
Coroner Leland, and as I am not a
lady, your query is sidestepped," was
the judicial answer.
Miss Monroe then professed ability to
produce "100 reputable witnesses" to
prove that she v, - as of irreprorie{iable
character and that Patrolman Fogarty
made the blunder of his career when
he arrested her.
"Have your witnesses here next
Tuesday," said the Judge."
Jane Murray, SS years of age, could
not be ousted from the apartment she
occupied at 21 Brady street, for which
she had paid no rent for three months,
until the landlady, Mrs. K. Rahill,
had her arrested for disturbing the
peace. Thi defendant did not look to
be within a score of years of her given
age as she stood before Judge Mogan
and pleaded not guilty, but the evi
dence that she had given Mrs. Rahill a
"tongue lashing" was so conclusive
that there was nothing else for the
court to do than pronounce her guilty.
Mrs. Rahill said she did not desire to
have the old woman sent to jail, but
would like to have her compelled to
remove herself and her personal be
longings from 21 Brady street. Mrs.
Murray agreed to do that and the case
was dismissed. .
Fred Cordovlola, convicted of steal
ing: $6 25 from John Parodi of 2221
Mason street, was sent to the Superior
Court by Judge Conlan, with bail fixed
at $2000.
J. C. Kennoth and Rudolf Quallo, ac
cused by Joseph King, proprietor of
the New Western Hotel, of having de
frauded him of about $4000 by means of
a "crooked" card game, will have a
hearing next Friday before Judge Ca
baniss. Judge Mogan refused to try
the case, as he had reason to believe
that King regarded him as an enemy
ajid he had no desire to have anything
whatever to do with the hotel man.
Miss Annie Davis reiterated her
statement that Miss Ruth Clifford was
"a lady" known to the terpsichorean
sisterhood of Pacific street as "Rough
House Ruth," and that the title was
aptly bestowed.
"No better proof of Miss Clifford's
unenviable reputation for slugging peo
ple," paid Miss Davis, "could be given
than my failure to procure witnesses to
testify as to her character. All the
ladies employed in the dance halls
know her so well that they are afraid
t<* provoke her enmity."
Miss Clifford pleaded that her assault
upon Miss Davis was amply provoked.
"She is always mooching around,"
said Miss Clifford, referring to Miss
Davis, "and every time another girl
gets a gentleman to dance with her
this Davis thing tries to steal him
away. That's what I punched her for.
She tried to rob me of a soldier.".
"Tell you what I'll do." said Judge
Mogan, "I'll continue this caae till
October 14, and if you, Miss Clifford,
punch anybody and are arrested for it
before that date I'll send you to, the
County Jail. As for you, Miss Davis,
be more dlscrept in your 'mooching.' "

TIIE DOCTOR'S WIFE
Agrees With Him About Food.
A trained nurse says: "In the prac-
tlc* of my profession I have found so
many points in favor of Grape-Nuts
that I unhesitatingly recommend It to
ali my patients.
"It Is delicate and pleasing to the
palate (an essential in food for the
Elck) and can be adapted to all ages,
being softened with milk or cream for
babies or the aged when deficiency of
teeth renders mastication impossible.
For fever patients or those on liquid
diet I find 'Grape-Nuts and albumen
water very nourishing and refreshing.'
This recipe is my own idea and is made
ns follows: Soak a teaspoonful of
Grape-Nuts In a jrlafs of water for an
hour, Btrain and Krve with the beaten
white of an egg and spoonful of fruit
Juice for flavoring. Thia affords a
great deal of nourishment that even
the weakest stomach can assimilate
without any distress.
"My husband is a physician and he
uses Grape-Nuts hirnself and orders It
many times for his patients.
"Personally I regard a dish of Grape-
Nuts with fresh or stewed fruit as the
ideal breakfast for any oneâ well or
pick." Name given by Postum Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich.
In any case of stomach trouble, ner-
vous prostration or brain fag. a 10
days* trial of Grape-Nuts will work
r.onders toward nourishing and re-
building, and In this way ending the
trouble.^ "There's a reason" and trial
proves. .

There is no further change In Feedstuff s.
Bran continues to arrive freely from the North
and is easy in consequence,
Somers & Co.'s circular says of Hay:
"The comparatively small quantity of 6500
tons of hay has arrived during the past . two
weeks, in comparison with 11,700 tons for the
preciding two weeka. - This would seem to
indicate that the country Â¦ was being cleaned
out of hay, but this Is not bo. It is reported
that several hundred Cars - of hay are on
various j sidetracks throughout' the country
awaking shipment here.' same having been put
to one side to accommodate the great rush of
passenger traffic occasioned by the recent con
vention here. During 'the convention week,
which was practically a succession of holidays,
there was but little over 1000 tons of hay
brought to market. For some unaccountable
reason but onÂ© car waa sidetracked In the yards
here, al thought It Is well known that there
are many Just out of town awaiting track
room. There Is, therefore, nothing promis
ing in the situation here and in all probabil
ity when' the present blockade Is relieved there
will be a badly demoralized market.
"The Llvermore district reporta that prac
tically the enltre crop ia housed, but around
Stockton and in many parts of Contra Costa,
Sonoma and Solano counties there- are yet
large quantities of hay that must find their
way to this market.
'"Trade showa no improvement here, for the
general dullness In local demand is still very
manifest.' Some little hay is moving coast
wise, but aside from this we are not doing our
regular summer's business. .
'An occasional car of choice wheat hay sells
above quotations, but other grades continue
as before." Â¦ t

COTTON â The eharp upturn ia th* cotton
Bexket to-iay was principally the result of
nervousness over the crop and outlook for
much colder &sd wet weather :r. the cotton
.belt ar.d a continuation of bad crop reports
corr.ir.g from Texas, Alabama and South Caro
lina aa Â«!l n- the Mississippi Valley. This
le<l to the development of a much better de
mand for - *pots from spinner* her* and in
Europe, and in view of the exhausted stocka
lure and at Liverpool and Manchester aa
well as at' Bremen end Havre this demand Is
likely to cor:tir.ue until spinners have pro
jected tberawlves and replenished their stocks
to a cxter.t to rirotect against a pos
fible disaster overtaking the crop. Cotton, we
apree, is high compared with a few years aga.
Uut the consum;.tion has so greatly Increased
within the past quarter of a century that there
Â»I>!*aj-!> to bt no limit to its possibilities. In
the meantime it may come to pass that the
worlds area suitable for totton may have to
bt teriouely reckoned. Cotton ha* proven to
I. :he cheapest material ytt known to be
rr.adi\ TlVe think, therefore, that we will have
to accustom ourselves to present prices, and
vi t Mill believe in higher prices and continue
â¢to. advise purchases on any decline.

Fteadier and Jcse opposed than any time during
th* movement. Offerings to take profit*, which
mst on the way up, seemed to bÂ« lighter
than before, aM the beara made no apparent
attempt to contest the advance. In fact, they
Â¦were w".':.rjr it by their eflorta to cover short

the persistent strength of the market to' at
tempt renewed opposition. Thus freed from
obstacles the cpvard course of pricea w&a
practically continuous, except for occasional In

els. Primary receipts â¢ were 993,100 bushels,
compared with 1.1TU, 000 bushels -a year ago.
Minneapolis, Duluth and Chicago reached re
ceipts of .401) cars, atainst 4-1 .last week and
7C'J a year ago.
â¢Weakness prevailed in the corn market ear
ly in the session, owing to the failure to ma
terialize during the snight of ,' the , predicted
frusta, rains over the greater portion of the
com belt having protected the' crop from dam
age in that direction.- The initial 'decline in
wheat also had a depressing . influence in the
corn pit.- Later in the day the market sud-
denly turned strong, the bull factor being a'
Minneapolis crop expert's estimate on the total
yield. According to' this authority the Gov
ernment figures should be discounted by 300,
0Â»X>,000 bushel*. The market again -weakened
late In I the session under liberal liquidation,
the selling being a result of private advicea
claiming little damage by frost to the crop.
Another bear factor was the heavy primary
receipts. Tbe close "was- near the- low -point.
December opened %Â©'?sc lower at 62%c to
63i4c, sold between 52%c and 54',;e, and
closed at 63@53%c. Local receipts were 650 s
cars, with 36 of contract grade.
Oats were largely governed by the course of
both of the other grains. Trading was. light
as a result ' of small otterings, December
opened %c lower at 33%c, sold between 32%c
and 83%o and closed at 33'sc. Local receipts
were 121. cars.
Small receipts of hogs and higher prices at
the yards imparted a firm undertone to the.
provision market. Trading was light and con
fined ,' mostly to pit traders. A feature of
trading . was the . selling out of the j October
products. At the dose January pork j wai up
7%e at $12 72%. Lard and ribs were each up
2%Â©5c at 7 17%@? 20 and ?6 67% respect
ively.

United States District Judge de
Haven sat yesterday as a United States
Circuit Judge to try Thomas Davis for
a felonious' assault alleged to have
bten committed upon the person of
Mrs. ; Emma Ames on board tne
steamer Alliance on October 15 or
last year while she was on her way
from San Francisco to her home in
Marshfield. Or. At the time of_ the
alleged outrage she was seasick in
her stateroom with her two children,
six and four years of age. respectively.
Davis left the vessel at Seattle and
was arrested two months later in tnis
city by United States Secret Service
Agent George XV. Hazen.
Horace Laws, night watchman on
board" of the Alliance, testified that
Waiter Davis had confessed to him
that he had assaulted Mrs. Ames. Mr.
Ames was on the stand when an ad
journment was taken until to-day.
This is the second trial, the jury
having disagreed on the first. A con
viction would have called for a death
sentence or imprisonment for life.
Since then a new indictment has been
presented containing a count charging
attempted assault, the punishment for
which is three xears* Imprisonment
in the penitentia^'. Â¦ â¢ ,

Mrs. McNemcr came to this city on |
Monday in answer to a matrimonial
advertisement in a San Francisco
paper. She left her husband In
Lincoln, and. bringing her little boy
with her. -went to the address given in
the advertisement. She says she saw
Powell at room No. 424 Callaghan
building, and, after a conference that
teemed satisfactory, gave him her
pursf, from which he took all the
money. He then invited her to dinner
amd afterxvard made her his guest for
two days, after which he turned her
out and told her to go home.
The woman was penniless, and called
at the Hall of Justice to get a warrant
for Powell's arrest. Bond and War
rant Clerk Kennedy sent a nole to ]
Powell by Detective Anthony asking
him to rome to the Hall of Justice.
Powell at first denied everything to
Anthony, then admitted that the
Â¦woman's story was in the main the
truth. He gave no reason for his ac
tions, and denied that he had robbed
Mrs. McNemer, but stated that If she
said he had, he would return any
amount that Fhe named. He seemed
thoroughly frightened and Bond Clerk
Kennedy told the woman to wait until
this morning to see if Powell would
make a settlement and send her home.
Mrs. McNemer "was provided a place to
Bleep last night and her cage will be
disposed of to-day.
Mrs. Alice McNemer, a married
woman of Lincoln, a small burg near
Sacramento, called at the Hall of Jus
tice last night to secure a warrant for
the arrest of Charles E. Powell, an of
ficial of the National Realty and In-
Eurar.ce Company. She alleges that
PoweJl robbed her under rather re
markable? circumstances, and then
turned her out without a cent.
A question of. .considerable^ impor
tance was raised by' the. application of
G. H. Harrington-of Santa Cruz to be
permitted to use the trails in the State
park to move in materials and to move
out shakes from land that immediately
adjoins the park. It was voted to in
struct the warden' not to permit the
trails to be, used for commercial pur
poses. Harrington, may fight the com
mission on this, as .he has- no visible
' Mrs. Lovell White, representing the
Sempervirens-Club. made. 'application,
in behalf of the club, for a lease of
land on' which to erect a clubhouse for
members. The association has five
large branches in the State. The mat
ter was taken.under advisement.
â¢ Commissioner .W. H. Mills, who pre
sided" at the . meeting, elicited many
facts , by asking questions. The cost
to the State for extinguishing the fires
in the park , will' be something like
$1500. The v standing/ 1 dead timber in
the park served as fuel to spread the
flames more rapidfjK. - Â¦ Â¦:
â¢ The commissioners, discussed the best
methods for guarding the park against
tires. It was agreed that it is wise
to keep the underbrush cleared away.
The commissioners declared that no
â¢ fire trail- could ip'ossibly have stayed
the progress of the flames while the
north wind was blowing. Such an ex
pedient as a fire trail -fifty feet wide
might be of benefit in a femall fire,
but not where "the conflagration .cov
ers an extensive territory. . ;
: Professor Dudley â¢ reported that the
fires are still smoldering ' in various
parts of Big Basin Park and a stiff
wind would fan the embers, into flames.
In view of this ' it was â¢ voted,* at the
suggestion of Commissioner Mills, that
ten. men be kept: In. the park to fight
fires and put in as much time as pos
sible en fire trails until the rains
drench the forests thoroughly.
CLUBHOUSE IX PARK.
Owing to the conditions mentioned by
Commissioner , Kron \ and Professor
Dudley ' the fire effects were strange.
Lofty trees were .denuded ef foliage
from the" ground to their topmost twigs/
Great billows of flame swept down into
a gorge some distance from. . the
Sempervirens'. .camp -and -underbrush
and small trees th*re fairly melted
away in the intense heat. . Nbtfaf dis
tant the drealeas escaped unharmed and
are still green .along the creeks. About
100 acres of redwood timber in the park
was burned. ' " .â¢
By night the fires died down. In the
morning the. north wind blew strong,
bringing with it the heat of the inter
ior valleys, drying all inflammable ma
terial, so that the terrific leaps of the
flames were from blazing trees to areas
of combustible, growths. \ .
There were whirls of wind, while the
fires were raging, that twisted eft* the
tops of redwood and oak treesâtorna
does caused by 'the intense heat. Fallen
trunks of trees /were converted into
mounds of iture white ashes.
Commissioner Kron yesterday told
his: associates Â«-in. the State Redwood
Park Commission, haying charge of the
Big Basin Park, that the rece'tat forest
fires covered about one-t'hird of the en
tire area of ,the . 3900 'acres included
within the park boundaries. -The com
missioner's narrative was 'not without
elements of public interest. The State
paid $250,000 for the park in the first
instance. .It has expended certain sums
to make it accessible. Telegraphic ac
counts- of â¢ the. 'forest fires had it that
very fe\v large sempervirens trees were
permanently injured.- Commissioner
Kron attributed to the ! thick bark or
"Jackets" of the .trees their marvelous
escape. Through, the rind,; practically
impervious to ordinary fires, the flames
did not penetrate.
'.'Warden Pilkington reports," .. said
Kron. "that the flames jumped as much
as half a. mile,- igniting trees that were
far from the main conflagration."
Professor Dudley of Stanford Univer
sity, the secretary of the commission,
told hc-w the Stanford- students had
rallied to assist fighting the towering
flames in the Big Basin.. They worked
with. railroad, trackmen, and the. small
force .of men that Warden Pilkington
had in the park when the fire was dis
covered sweeping over the 1600- foot
ridge frcm Pescadero Creek, destroy
ing houses, bridges, vineyards and
grain fields.
