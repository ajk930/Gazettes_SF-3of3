Russia's reply to the demands of Japan will be laid before the conference to-day by M, Witte.
The Czar's envoys are opposed to the paying of indemnity together with the" cession of territory and
it is feared the negotiations may be broken off The outlook for peace is considered gloomy. The
deepest pessimism reigns in both camps at Portsmouth and to-day 's meeting is anxiously awaited.

RENO. Augr. ILâ The Southern Paciflo
Company to-< Jay brought suit In the Dis
trict Court of Washoe County to OU3t
prospectors now working on what they
claim as Government land ia the famous
OHnghouse district. In addition the rail
road also asks for $5500 damages. The suit
practically ties up the richest mines in,
Nevada, properties from which almost
virgin gold is now being extracted.
Buck Ingall3* famous claim, the prop
erty of Colonel Bovee and that of many
others are affected, and the result It ia
thought will tie up a portion of the great
district for years to come. The. railroad
claims ownership by reason of Govern
ment grants of every odd section of land
through the State. The miners, on the
other hand, claim that they are entitled
to all mineral on the land.
Several months ago the railroad an
nounced it would cede back* certain min
eral lands in the Oflnghouse district! This
resulted In a rush to the district and
much money was invested on what U
known as section 29, the land now In dis
pute. The news of the big finds made
there, announced during the past few
weeks, it Is thought, has caused the
Southern Pacific to take action. A bitter
gult Is looked for.

in this city. Drouln married the daugh

wealthy wholesale grooer of Peoria,
and Inherited the entire fortune which
has since been wasted. When found
his wife, apparently distracted by the
death of her husband, was holding the feet
of the corpse in the air In order, as she
said, to allow the soul to escape. Mrs.
Drouin was formerly a belle of this
city. Her husband was a member of
the firm of Work & Drouln, merchants
of Philadelphia. The cause of Drouln's
death is a mystery, which the Coroner
is endeavoring to solve.

PORTSMOUTH, , N. H. t Aug. U.-De
spite the optimistic views taken In many
centers that . are In close communication
with the scene of the peace conference
that the negotiations will terminate suc
cessfully, there are weighty: reasons, for
believing that the outlook is gloomy. This
will probably be made clear to-morrow
when the Russian reply is laid before the
conference, : The Russian envoys take the
position:
That Russia is not defeated; that she
does" not i expect â¢to be defeated in case
the war is prolonged, and that she can
not be expected to pay an indemnity and
to cede territory, for these reasons: '
Firstâ Because an Indemnity is not ex
tracted from. a foe that is not conquered
and is still able to fight.
Secondâ Because cession of territory is
only demanded of a foe whose country
Is prostrate in the enemy's hands. \u25a0
It is, of course, possible the reply of
Russia will be couched in such' general
terms as : to -permit "of a continuance of
negotiations, \u25a0 but Russia* will make It
known that she | cannot part with terri
tory and' money in the present state of
the war. "She Is willing to get out of
Manchuria; â¢ she Is willing that' Japan
should have Port Arthur,' the LiaoTung
peninsula, â¢ the Eastern/ Chinese railroad,
a protectorate . over Korea and commer
call advantages which she Is understood
to have included in her terms. She might
also be willing to debate the question \u25a0 of
the 'size of a naval force to be. main
tained In the Pacific and. the question of
fisheries along. the Russian coast, but in
demnity and cession are so objectionable
to her that unless these demands should
be classified by Japan as susceptible of
modification, then there. ls likely to be a
serious deadlock : ln the conference. ,

SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 11.â One of
the passengers on the Santa Fe train
which reached here this afternoon
showed a bidly skinned nose as the re
sult of a unique experience on the desert.
Riding in the day coach, he dreamed that
the train had been wrecked. His fellow
passengers were startled by seeing him
dive head first through the window. His
neighbor grabbed at his heels, but was
too late. The man was seen to light head
first in the sand. He sat up to look at
the rear platform as it sped by.
The train was running only twenty
miles an hour and the sand was deep and
loose, so the dreamer was not hurt ex
cept on the nose. Speaking with a strong
German accent, he declined to give his

"Part of the funds with which to per

of Governor Deneen did not materialize.
Of $900 subscribed for this work, J6OO has
been paid for a transcript. of the evidence

the action of his attorneys in making the
above appeal to the public.
CHICAGO, Aug. 11.â Johann Hoch's
case may not be appealed and the sec

had it not been that the St. Louis editor
returned to the donors 1400 raised by him
to aid Hoch in appealing the case. Com

statement in part Is as follows:

was roundly cheered.

headed by Colonel Alexander Brodia.
The Secretary affirmed that a popu

insurrection exists in April, 1907.
The administration's policy, he said,
was t!se Philippines for the Filipinos.
If the American officials were not in
sympathy with this -policy and the na
tives they would be recalled.
Secretary Taft said in conclusion that
it was t)w>. President's desire that all
must work for their "benefit.
Representative Hepburn spoke along
the same lines.
A POPULAR ASSBMBLY.
"The second party has for its chief
exponent President Roosevelt. He be
lieves that it Is the duty of the United
States to prepare the Filipinos for self
government. This may require a gen
eration and probably longer, and the
form of self-government will be left to
the individuals who will control the
two nations at that time. It follows
that the President, and he, himself, de-
Fired me to say this to the Filipinos,
feels charged with the duty of pro
ceeding on this policy and maintaining
here the sovereignty of the United
States as an Instrument for the grad
ual education and elevation of the
whole of the Filipino people to a self
grovernlngr community."
Secretary Taft in forceful language
stated that the Filipinos who wish to
rule this country must first learn the
principles of democracy by sending
their children to the common schools
before they can invite the United States
to transfer the trust which has been
thrown upon it to their shoulders.
To make a self-governing and popular
democracy, primary education, habits of
greater industry and thrift must al
ways be kept, he said, before the young,
patriotic Filipinos.
"In a number of the provinces," said
Secretary Taft, "the people with the
irrcatest difficulty avoid starvation.
Now this is not due to the soil or un
favorable agricultural conditions. -All
these are easily overcome by the in
dustry which is manifest In Java and
\u25a0Japan. The foundation of a great na
tion like Japan is in the Industry, thrift
and intelligence of the people."
"There Is a third party, which favors
giving the islands immediate independ
ence. This party may be divided Into
two classes, having different motives.
The first class is anxious to .rid the
United States of the burden of governing
the Filipinos for the benefit of the United
States. The second class is anxious to
rid the Philippines of the government of
the United States on the ground that the
Filipinos can make their own govern

defeated at a national election on this

"There is a party, and this is much the
largest, which regarded our taking over
the islands from Spain after the war with
the gravest reluctance and who would
have been gratified in the extreme if the
assumption of the burden could have
been avoided. This subject has been un
der consideration by this party, and, in
deed, by the whole American people,
and the attitude of mind they now hold
respecting the Philippines may be stated
â¢with some accuracy.
"They have come to the conclusion
that, however reluctant they were to ac

their duty to meet the responsibilities im
posed with promptness, courage and
hope. They believe that they have be-

"On my part it is due you that if I do
nothing else to-night I shall make clear
tt.e views of the administration upon the
present and future of the islands. The
American people are divided upon the
question I am discussing into three par
ties. There is a considerable number who
have the real imperialistic idea of ex

possible of the Oriental yet unde

The Government permitted and encour

patches containing the Japanese condi
tions which like a fiery cross rallied
disunited Russian clans, Conservatives,
Liberals and Radicals.
With scarcely an exception every voice
is raised In urging the Government to
hold out against Japan's principal de
mands. The correspondent talked with
the leading men of various classes, not
only public officials, but lawyers, doctors,
merchants and journalists, and all'de
clared that a continuation of war would
be ""better than the acceptance of such
terms. The same spirit Is manifested in

"In these Japanese conditions all hope
of peace has vanished."
Indignation also is growing over what
is regarded as a doubtful procedure on
the part of the Japane.se with regard to
their credentials and many are asking
what is > the real reason underlying their
action.

Not only the .men In control 'of these corpo

The effort to prevent all restraint of compe
tition, whether harmful or beneflciaJ. has bÂ»en
ill-judged; what is needed is not so much the
effort to prevent combination as a vigilant ajid
effective control of the combinations formed
so as 'to secure just and equitable dealing on
their part alike toward . the- public generally,
toward their smaller competitors and toward
the wage workers in their employ.
Under the present laws we have in the last
four yoars accomplished much that 1b of sub
stantial value; but the difficulties in the way
have been go great aa* to prove that further
legislation is advisable. Many- corporations
show themselves honorably desirous to obey
the law; -but unfortunately,- ' some corpora
tions, and very wealthy ones ,a.t that, exhaust
every effort which can be ' suggested by the
highest ability, or secured by'the most lavish
ex]>endlturc of money, to defeat the purposes
of the laws on the statute books. . " J
One of the main features' of our na
tional governmental policy 'should be
the effort to secure adequate and effec
tive supervisory and regulatory control
over all great corporations doing an in
terstate hu&lriess. Much of the legisla
tion aimed to prevent the evils con
nected with the enormous, development
at these great corporations has been in
effective, partly because it aimed at do
ing too much, and partly because It did
not confer on the. Government n really
efficient method of holding - an?f guilty
corporation to , account. .
So much for -one feature of our foreign pol
icj-. Now ' for one feature oi our domestic
policy. \u25a0â¢ ..-

AecordinKly the executive department of
our Government negotiated a treaty under which
we are to try to help the Dominican people
to straighten out th*!r finances. This treaty
Is pending before the Senate, whose consent
to It Is necessary. In the meantime we have
rr.ade a temporary arrangement which will
last unlil the Senate hap had time to take
action upon th* treaty. Under this arrange
ment we *cc to the honest administration of
the custom-houses collecting the revenues
turning over 45 per cent to the Government
for running expenses and putting the other 55
per cent Into a safe depot Â« for equitable di
vision among the various creditors, whether
Kuropean or American, accordingly as, . after

The conditions of Santo Domingo have for
a number of year* grown from bad to worse
until recently all eocietx was on tlip v Â«tk* ot
dissolution. Fortunately jUFt at this time a
wise rukT sjirang up in Santo Domingo, who,
with his colleagues, saw th* dangers threat
ening fielr beloved country, and appealed to
the friendship of their ptet and powerful
neighbor to help them. The immediate threat
came to them in the thape of foreign inter
vention. The previous rulers of Santo Do
mingo had recklessly incurred debts, and ow
ing to her internal disorder* she had ceased
to be able to provide means of paying ithe
<Irbts. The patience of her foreign creditors
had become exhausted, and at least one-for
eign nation was on the point of intervention
an-J wa? only prevented from intervening by
t*jÂ«" uiroffieial assurance of this Government
that it would Itself Ftrivr to help Santo Do
mingo in her hour of need. Of the debts in
curred some wire just, while some w/?re not
of a character which leally renders.it obliga
tory on or proper for, Santo Domingo to pay
them in full. But she could not pay any ot
them at all unless some stability was assured
Santo Domingo hns now made nn ap
peal to am to help It In turn, nnd not
only every principle of wisdom but
every generous instinct within iin bids
us respond to the appcnl.
In thÂ» interest of Jufti.-e. it is as necrsary
to ex*rcife thÂ» pcllre rower as to show
charity and helpful generosity. But Fbrnfthing
can even now be done -toward jthe end in
vi^w. That something, for lnsttf&ce. this na
tion has already done as regard? Cuba, and
is" now trying to do as regards Santo Dc
m!n?o. There are few things in our history
in which we should take more genuine prid*
than the way in which we liberated Cuba,
and then, instead of instantly abandoning it
to chaos, stayed in direction of the affairs of
thÂ» island until we had put it on the right
path and finally gave it t reborn and helped
it as it ttarted on the lif* of an Independent
republic.

BERLJN, Aug. 12.â The newspapers this

express their opinion on the Japanese
peace terms. Some regard them as hard
for Russia, but say they are. only what
was to be expected. Russian utterance*
at Portsmouth and St. Petersburg pro
nouncing the terms unacceptable are
treated here as signifying nothing.
Baron Komura's withholding of; the
amount Japan will ask as reimbursement
for war expenditures is regarded as a
shrewd move designed to get thÂ© Rus

the Russian authorities and publics be

an Enthusiastic Greeting.
BINOHAMTQX. N. V.. Aug. 11.âPres
ident i Roosevelt, on his return trip
from \u25a0 ;.- Chautauqua to Oyster Bay,
passed to-day and to-night through
three great States â New York. Penn
sylvania and New Jersey. At every
station where a stop was made he was
accorded a greeting as affectionate as
it was enthusiastic. Along the entire
route this afternoon and this evening
rain fell heavily, but the storm seemed
to have little effect on the determina
tion of the people to see the President,
and, if possible, to hear him speak. Dur
ing the afternoon President Roosevelt
made brief addresses from the rear
platform of his car â at Salamanca,
Hornell3ville, Klmira and Waverly. N.
Y. At Hbrnellsville the President
â¢ touched upon the horrors of the yellow
fever .epidemic now raging in New Or
leans. 'He said:
The city of New Orleans is suffering in its
contest with yellow fever and no one who has
not been through an epidemic or the threat
of an epidemic of the kind can appreciate the
full horror, that It brings. The national Gov
ernment is now doing whatever it can do to
help New OrleanÃ. As yet that sympathy is
limited simply to- the - action of thÂ»Â» medical
branch. We stand ready to help that great
city' at any time and I know that the ojao
ple's sympathy goes out to the people of New
Orleans and" Louisiana as they battle vali
antly against the foe that " has come upon
them.
Every station on the line of the Erie
Railroad from Hbrnellsville to thfs
point was thronged with people. At one
or two places, where the train slowed
down but dld-not stop, the President
waved his hand at the crowds, which
broke Into cheers as the special passed.
At Elmira. where a convention of vol
unteer firemen is being' held, the Presi
dent briefly addressed them. He said:
In greetine all of you, I want to say a
word of special greeting to the members of tht-
Firemen's Association that have met here with
in the last day or.two. In our modern industrial
life thlnss are sometimes made so easy that
the hardier qualities almost amount to a
trophy. Therefore, it is fine to see men who
have taken up a profession which calls for
the exercise of every ounce of courage and
coolness and prowess a man can have. These
are good qualities to develop in a nation and
I am mighty glad to- see any of our people
who develop them. There are certain classes
of our people, such as firemen, most of those
employed on railroads, the lighthouse and
11f.6. aavinc cervices, who, by the very fact
of their professions are called upon to aot
those qualities -of which" this nation would
have need- should it ever again be called to
war. 1 earnestly hope It never will be called
again and I will make every effort to see that
peace continue*, but one of the easiest ways
of ' keeping peace is to make it evident that
you are not afraid to fight. I have a treat
contempt for the brawler and not merely con
tempt but the most active dislike for the maji
who wrongs the leÂ«3 fortunate. I feel that
we should have the same kind of- interna
tional morality as of Individual morality. I
should ' certainly protest as strongly against
this nation doing jtught that waa wrong to
any other nation as I should protest -against
an individual doing such wrong, but let us be
strong enough to hold our own.
Before the President left Lakewood
the 'private i car of Frederick D. Under
wood, president .of .the Erie Railroad,
was attached to the special train. Oh
board were President Underwood, Seo
ond Vice President C. A. Richardson
and General. Manager J. C. Stuart, who
accompanied the train to Jersey City.
Every precaution possible. was taken by
the -Erie officials to insure to the Pres
ident a safe journey, over the lines. â¢
<A, pilot locomotive was run ahead of
the train over the entire route, and an
other locomotive followed-, the special
at a distance of a-.few minutes to be
ready-, in. case, of emergency. All.'trackt
work was suspended along the' lines
ten minutes before the special was due
to arrive at any point where work was

ROME. Aug. 11. â The opinion is ex

Is tnougrht. derogratory to rtuswinu pricJe." !

territory are demanded. The view in
military circles is that Russia intends
to do the best possible for herself, but
will accept in tbe end.
In the main the Japanese terms are
less exorbitant than -was expected here
and the hope is expressed that an
agreement will be reached.

The enormous Increase^iii 5 interstate
trade, resulting from the Industrial de
velopment of the last quarter of a cen-.
tury^' "makes it proper : that the Federal'
Government should,"- so far as may be
necessary to enrrx Into effect Its na
tional pulley, iiMKtiine a 'degree of ad
ministrative control of .these .great cor
porations. - ' '"; .'â¢ 1
It may weir be that 'we' shall find that the
only effective way o% exercising this super
vision is to require all -corporations engaged in
interstate commerce to produce \u25a0 proof satisfac
tory, say, to the Department of Commerce,
that they are not parlies to any contract or
combination or- Engaged in any monopoly in
interstate trade In violation of the anti-trust
law, and that their conduct on certain other
yjieciiied polntis is* proper; and, moreover, tijat
these corporations .shall agree, with a penalty
of forfeiture of their rigm. to engage in such
commerce, to furnish any evidence of any kind
as to thc-lr trade between the States whenever
so required by the" Department of Commerce.
It Is the almost universal policy of the sev
eral States provided by. statute, that foreign
corporations may lawtully Conduct business
within their boundaries only when they pro
duce certificates that they have complied with
the requirements of their respective totates; in
other words, that corporations shall not enjoy
the privileges" and immunities afforded by the
i-lato governments without first complying with
the policy of their . laws. Now the benefits
which corporations engagea in Interstate trade
enjoy under the ' United States Government are.
incalculable; and in-respect of such trade. the
jurisdiction of the Federal Government is ea
prenie when It chooses to exercise.it.
When, as is now the case, many of
the great corporations consistsntly
strain the lost resources of % legal tech
nicality to uvoid obedience to a law
foT the reasonable regulation of their
business, the only way effectively to
meet thH attitude on their part is to
give the executive department of the
Government a ' more direct- a nÂ«r there
fore more efficient supervision nnd con
trol of their management.
In speaking against the abuses committed
by certain very wealthy corporations or indi
viduals, and of the necessity Â« "Â«*lnÂ«- so
far as it can safely be done, to remedy these
abuses, there is always danger lest, what U
eaid may be misinterpreted as an ; attack upon
men of means generally. Now t cannot too
often be repeated in a republic like-oura that
the only- way by which it is- possible perma
nently to benefit the condition of the less
aWe and less, fortunate Is so to shape our
policy .that all Industrious and efficient people
who act decently may be benefited; and this
means, of course, that the benefit wiir come
even more to the more able and more fortun
ate If. under such circumstances, tne less
fortunate man is. moved by envy oÂ£ hta more
fortunate brother to strike at the. conditions
under which they have both, _ though .un
equally, prospered, he. may rest assured that
while the result may bo damaging to me
other man. It will be 1 even more damaging- to
hlmaelf. Of course. 1 am now speaking of
prosperity that cornea under normal and proper
conditions.
SomÂ« great corporations .resort to every
technical expedient to rentier enforcement of
the law- impossible, and their obstructive tac
tics and refusal, to acquiesce in the policy of
the law have taxed to the utmost the ma
chinery of the Department of Justice. In my
judgment Congress may well inquire whether it
6houia not seek other means for carrying into
effect the law.' I believe that all corporations
engaged in interstate commerce should be un
der the aupervlslop of the national Government.
I do not believe in taking steps hastily or
rashly; .and it may- be that all that is necee
eary rin the immediate future is to pass an in
terstate commerce, bill conferring upon some
branch; of *.he executive government the power
of -'effective action to remedy . the abuses in
connection with railway transportation- But
in the end, and -in my judgment at a time not
very far oft, we shall have to, or at least we
shall find that we ought to, take further action
as regards all corporations doing Interstate
business. . â¢ â¢> - ; - >â¢ <
Chief Executive Does Not Believe, How
ever, in Takinsr Steps Hastily '
. ' ' or, Rashly.
I <\n not mean to say that nations have
more than begun to approach the proper re
lationship < ne to another, and I .fully recog
r'ze the folly of proceeding upon the assump
tion that this ideal condition can now be
rraliied in foilâ for. in order to proceed upon
6iK-h an assumption, we would flm require
some method of forcine recalcitrant nations
to do their duty, as well as of seeing tha*
they are protected in their rights.
Vnder strain of emotion cÂ«UMd by sudden
disaster this fueling is very evident. A famine
or a plague in one country brings much sym
pathy and some assistance from other coun
tries MorÂ«-over, we are now beginning to
teo.gnize that weaker paries have a clafm
upon Ã¼b. pven Â»hen the appeal Is made, not
t.> our emotions by t-ome sudden calamity,
but to our conscience? by a long continuing
cr,T,<sition of affairs.
Finally, and what is in my view. reall r v the
most Important thing of all. it ts our duty,
so far as we are able, to try to help/ upward
our weaker brothers. Just as there has been
a jrradual growth of the ethical element in
th- relations of one individual to another, co
that with all the faults of our Christian clvili
zf-pon it yet remains true that we are, im
mater how slowly, more and more- coming to
rocoenize the duty pf bearing one another b
burdens, similarly I believe that the ethical
element !s by degree entering into the dealings
of one nation with another.
I do not want to Â«p? any foreign power ta Â£ e
possession permanently or temporarily of the
custom-houses of an American republic in. or
der to enforce Ite obligations, and the a ter
nativ* may at any time be that we shall tie
frrred to do 6O ourselves.
Ac to the second point, if a republic to the
fcurh of us commits a tort aguinst a foreign
pption. such, for instance, as wrongful ac
tion against the arsons of citizens of that
naiicn. then the Monroe doctrine do?E rot
f, ne us to interfere to prevent punishment
of the tort, fave to see that the punishment
does net directly or indirectly assume the
firm of territorial occupation of the offendtnK
ccgntry. The c*se is more difficult when the
trouble comes from the failure to meet con
tractual obligations. Our own . Government
las always refused to enforce such oontractual
rW!gatinn.Â« on behalf of Its citizens by the
air-fal to arms. It is much to be wished that
a!! foreign governments would take the same
view. But at present thlÂ» country would cer
tainly not bÂ« willing to go to war to prevent
a foreign government fr6m collecting a just
debt or to back up some one of our sister re
publics in a refusal to pay Just debts: and
the alternative may in any case prove to be
that we shall ourselves unueitake to bring
ebout som" arrangement by which so much
aÂ« is possible of the just obligations shall be
pzld. Personally I should always prefer to see
th's country step in and put through such an
ananpemf-nt rather than let any foreign coun
try undertake it
nmnded hr our sself-respec t that this
action will not take the form of ter
ritorial agcrandlicnient on our part,
nnd that It will only be taken at nil
with the most extreme reluctance and
not without having exhausted every ef
fort to avert it.

Of coarse there Is always the danger

\u25a0VVe must not try to go too fast, under
penalty of finding that we may. be KoinK In
the wrong direction; and in any event, we
ought always to proceed by evolution and not

that we do not intend to treat it in any shape or way as

not intend to permit it to be used by any of these repub

that inasmuch as by this doctrine we prevent other na

recently lndioted in Chicago, It Is im
possible louder to .show leniency. More
over, if the ex letting; lutv proven to be
inudoqunte, so that under established
rules of evidence clear -violations may
not be readily proved, defiance of the
lan muÃt inevitably lead to farther
legislation.
This legislation may be more drastic than I
would prefer. If fo, it must be distinctly un
derstood that it will bÂ« because of the stubborn
.determination of some of the {Treat combina-
tlons in striving to prÂ«wnt the en
forcement of the law as it stands',
by every lievlct. legal- and illegal.'
Very many of \u25a0 these men neern to think that
the alternative is simply between submitting
to the mild kind of governmental control we
advocate and the absolute ireedom to do what*'
ever they think best. They are greatly Jn,er
ror. Either they will have to submit to rea
sonable supervision and regulation by the na-
tlonal authorities or else they, will ultimately
have to submit to governmental action of a far
more drastic . type. Personally, ! I think our
peopl* would be most unwise if they let any
exasperation due to the. acts of certain great
\u25a0corporations ;drive them into drastic action,
and 1 should oppose such action. But the
great- .corporations are themselves' to blame if

ANY HASTY ACTION
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â Secretary of
State Root, who recently entered Piesi
dent Roosevelt's Cabinet, says the Times
to-day, severed all connections with a
number of financial institutions of which
he was formerly a director. .'Mr.. Root re
cently resigned, it became known *yestef
day, from the boards of the .Morton
Trust Company, the National Bank of
Commerce, the "Continental Fire Insur
ance Company, the Title Guaranty and
Trust Company and several other cod-"
pqrations.
This action was taken, the Times con
tinues, in order that he might assume the
Secretaryship of State without being in
any way allied with corporate interests.
In conversation with hi 3 associates he is
said to have expressed the opinion that
it was better for him to be free of his
former connection with these institutions
as a director, and for this reason he re
signed from them all.
Root has betn a director of some of
these institutions for some years, includ
ing the period when he was Secretary
of War. Inquiry among.his former fellow
directors failed to reveal Root's reasons
for differentiation between the two posi
tions in the Cabinet so far as they affect
ed his personal business affairs. A â¢ : %

The strange mingling of summer
guests and the foreigners who have
come with the peace missions in va
rious capacities, and the precision of
etiquette observed between th*> large
corps of Japanese correspondents and
those who have come over from Europe,
occasion many amusing scenes on the
broad veranda and spacious parlors
and lounging rooms of the hotel. When
two Japanese correspondents meet, no
matter if for the fifteenth time the same
day, each will stop short before the
other and execute a bow which for me
chanical precision and accelerity of
movement is ideal.
The Japanese with the peace mission
exhibit great cordiality, and particularly
toward the Americans, and their enter
prise In placing themselves In positions
to observe the news rivals all competi
tors. This push was Illustrated most fav
orably on the day of the landing of the
envoys at the navy yard. Two Japa
nese correspondents presented themselves
to an official for admission to the yard.
They were told that passes had been
restricted, but were advised that should
the whole corps of Japanese correspon
dents get together and designate one of
their number, it would be undoubtedly
possible to gain admission for him.

hand on his chest, he executed the ever

one proposed that the party "go to Jer

time the music stopped. Aimaro Sato.
Minister Resident, and Commander Takas
hlta, of the Japanese suite, were eager
participants in the game. Mr. Sato was
the hero of the game.
One of the biggest features of the
day at the Wentworth Hotel was the
publication of the Japanese terms. Ef
forts were made to discredit their au
thenticity, but neither the Japanese nor
the Russians would discuss the subject,
and before nightfall all of those Inter
ested became convinced of their ac
curacy. Both Mr. Sato and Mr. Koros
tovitz, the spokesmen of their re
spective sides, declined to say anything
officially about the terms which, by
mutuil agreement, were to be kept se
cret, but Mr. Korostovitz. in the name
of M". \u25a0 Witte, did not hesitate to con
firm the accuracy of the Associated
Press' . statement, especially that the
Russian reply was completed and would
be delivered to-morrow. He even went
to the extent of saying that it would
be an agreement on some points, condi
tional agreement on some and rejec
tion of some : of the terms. He,al3o took
occasion to confirm the statement that
M. Witte had received no instructions
from St. Petersburg regarding the na
ture of the reply to be given, as his
powers were ample.
JAPANESE AXE COURTEOUS.
The question of the credentials has been
amicably adjusted upon the, assurance of
the Japanese that the powers granted
Baron Kurnura were in the regular form
always employed by Japan. Mr. Witte
will not "pursue the matter further. It is
believed that his object in presenting his
note on the subject was that it might go
into the record of the conference to show
that the widely published intimations
from Japanese sources before the confer
ence that the powers granted him would
not be full and ample were not only with
out foundation, but that his powers were,
in fact, greater than those bestowed upon
Earon Komura.

"The Japanese Government has only
asked what, according to Japanese ideas,
are considered most moderate terms. A
strong party in Japali favored claiming

evacuation of Manchuria, but also the

Little, however, has been accomplished

Chief Executive Defines
Our National For
eign Policy.
The violations of the law known as '. the anti-trust law,
which was meant to meet the conditions thus arising, have
more and more become confined to the larger combina
tions, the very ones against whose policy of monopoly and
oppression the policy of the law was- chiefly directed.
Many of these combinations by secret methods and by
protracted litigation are still unwisely seeking to avoid
the consequences of their illegal action. The Government
has very properly exercised moderation in attempting to
enforce the criminal provisions of the statute : but it has
become our conviction that in some cases, such as that of
at least certain of the beef puckers recently indicted in
Chicago.it is impossible longer to show leniency. More-,
over,. if the law proves to beÂ« inadequate; so r that under cs-.
tablished rules of evidence clear violations may not be
readily proved, defiance of the law must inevitably lead to
further \u25a0 legislation. â From President . Roosevelt's Address.

the West is remarkably good and stead
ily improving, and he added that the
business of the Southern Pacific Com
pany is progressing with the general con
dition. Before undertaking the construc
tion of the tunnels throuf^i the Sierras
the Harriman syndicate will have started
a number of extensions of its lines in the
Northwest, where it is estimated that
about $10,000,003 will be expended.
It is said that a line will be built from
Drain to Marshfield, on Coos Bay. which
will connect the main lines of the syndi
cate with the Coos Bay, Roseburg and
Eastern Railroad. The latter extends
from Marshfield twenty-eight miles to
Myrtle Point, touching at Coquille, and
has a branch to Beaver Hill. Other ex
tensions are being planned in Washing
ton and Idaho, including many road
buildings between Rlparla and Grange
vilTe, the cost of which, it is understood,
will be shared by James J. Hill of the
rival railroad system.
On his return to New York three
months hence President Harriman will
take up with Kuhn, Loeb & Co., for
whom he acts as financial agent with a
degree of shrewdness that has earned
for him the enmity of Gould, Hill and
Clark, the plan for issuing a consolida
tion bond for the Southern Pacific lines
in lieu of the bonds new out. Many of
the Southwestern lines of the Southern
Pacific system are now paying as high
as 6 per cent on bonds. It is the Harri
man plan to redeem these bonds and is
sue a 4 per cent bond, thus saving the
financial backers of the big railroad syn
dicate millions of money in interest.
Arriving here yesterday with a number
of Southern Pacific officials, who went up
the road to meet him. President Harri
man sent his family direct to the Palace
Hotel, then proceeded to the Southern
Pacific Company's new offices on Califor
nia street, where he entered upon a long
conference. He also spent some time with
General Manager Schwerln of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, and at the
close of the day he announced that the
business discussions would be resumed
early to-day and continue until he is
ready to. leave for the Orient.
During the week the visitors will be
given a novel entertainment in tha
form of a camp stew at Ragon's Grove.
The stew will be cooked by Frank Dul

DISTINGUISHED NAVAL OFFICER
WHO IS DEAD AT HIS HOME IN
NEW YORK.
A Tncre reference io the proposed new
electric line down the coast, which is be
ing promoted by James D. Phelan, J.
Downey Harvey and several other San
Francisco capitalists under the corporate
name of the Ocean Shore Railroad, did
r.ot seem to interest the Southern Pacific
president. Although it is known, that his
company \is quietly endeavoring to fore
stall the new enterprise by getting rights
cf way in its very path for another road,
Harriman remarked with a sig
nificant sign of indifference: "Oh, it don't
matter who builds that road. I don't
know anything about the project."
WKSTTRX BUSINESS GOOD.
President Harriman Eays business In
â¢â¢y>s, we arc considering that prop
osition. In fact I am now on my way
to the Southern Pacific Company office
to tr.lk over the matter with our of-
Qclals, Of course, it is a stupendous
u::clc- making, and it is hard to say when
the work will be taken up. Such a
riere of work entails the expenditure
of a lot of money. We are now spend
ing immense sums on Improvements in
the West, and there Is a limit to all
expenditures. You may. however, state
that the tunnels Jn the Sierras will be
liorod, but when I am not yet ready
to say. although I hope that the be
ginning of the engineering work Is not
many months ahead."
The tunnels are planned for two pur
poses, one of which is the overcoming
of steep grades, and the other the do-
In,â¢ away with thÂ»? forty-one enowsheds
that have been a constant annoyance
to the company for years. President
Jlarriinan said that the work on the
Hay Shore cutoff was being hurried
along as fast as possible and that aside
from this work nothing of great lm
jiortance to California was under con
sideration by himself and associates.
SriI,!.IOÂ¥S AHE INVOLVED.
T4J.KS OF BIG TUXXEI-S.
President Harriman is going to the
Orient on matters of great moment, and
\u25a0*!;:!<=\u25a0 there he will carefully study con
ditions of trade that have a mighty
bearing on the Pacific commerce In
which his steamship lines are an im
j.r.rtant factor. The report that hd
would visit the Philippines with a view
to looking into the prospects there for
railroad traffic was denied by him yes
. v rday, as was also the story that after
citing the Orient he and his family
trould proceed around the world. On
the contrary, the man of millions will
return to New York by way of San
Francisco, and as he admitted it yester
day he added that he would let the peo
ple here know when he was coming.
That President Harriman shares with
the Inte Collis P. Huntington the feel
ing that California does not treat his
railroad enterprises fairly was never
more plainly shown than in his refer
pnre to the bridging of Carquinez
Straits. He confesses that the Southern
Pacific Company is exceedingly anxious
to rut a bridge over the waters from
Port Costa to Benicia, but he also says
t-at it is not purely a selfish motive
tÂ¥~,t has prompted this project, but one
that will not only greatly facilitate the
transmission of freight but materially
add to the comforts of the traveling
j--.:hlic and shorten the time of travel
ing to and from San Francisco. Asked
concerning "other little matters," more
particularly the Ion;? talked of plan to
U:nnel the Sierra Nevada Mountains, a
project that the most cautious engi
r*-< rs, among thorn William Hood, have
estimated will cost in the neighborhood
of $45,000,000, the fame sum which, it
is estimated, it will cost to construct
th.- entire Western Pacific Railroad
from Salt Lake City to San Francisco,
President Harriman said:
"If the people of California will only
come to their senses the Southern Pa
ciSc Company may eventually build a
bridge across the Carquinez Straits and
greatly facilitate traffic business. At pres
er.i we are held back in this proposed un
d. raking byâ what shall I call it âwell
say notions." '
Edward H. Harriman, head of the gi
gantic system of Western railroads that
bc-ri.rs hie name, and the steamship lines
opt-ratir.g betwen t ..Â»s port and the
Orient, gave expression to the above re
mark yesterday while discus-sing the
probability of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's finally securing from the Wash
ington authorities the privilege of span
r.ir.g the straits with a bridge. His face
bore Its usually stern look, and his tone
plainly suggested tuat ne regards the re
cf-r.t public protests against the construc
tion of the bridge and :>-e interference of
navigation as a senseless move on the
j.>art of the citizens of California. He im
r:^c:aie'.y dismissed the subject and pro
ceeded to talk of other "little matters"
bs he was pleased to term themâ mere
*. i.f.c-s. involving sums ranging from
." 00.000 to KO.'.iuG.tAjOâ matters that have
:.;â¢ ne-i the ingenious minds of some of
the cleverest enginere in the country and
: â¢ even proved problems to some of
the noted tinanciers, including himself,
i f Wall street.

Harriman; Julius Kruttschnitt. director of
maintenance and operations of the Harri

Thf- txact purpose of President Harri
man's visit to the Far East is a secret
that be is not confiding to the American
public. The fact that his family accom
panies him augurs a possible pleasure
!-â¢;;â¢. bui jhe financier's friends in New
York know differently and merely attri
bute the presence of Mrs. Harriman and
i!.< children to the well known fact that
E. H. Harriman is, notwithstanding his

lover of home life, and a man who is

In the presence of a congregation of
mourners that partly filled the Cathe
dral, and with some fifty priests par
ticipating In the service, mass was said
to-day for Archbishop Chapelle. The
interment in the crypt of the Cathedral
followed. Archbishop Chapelle was the
second hend of the diocese to succumb
to the disease. Bishop Neckare, the
fourth Bishop of the diocese, died of
yellow fever here in 1833.
Tho Italian societies have completed
arrangements to relieve the distress of
their countrymen to the extent of fur
nishing them with meals daily.
Governor Blanchard to-day placed
$20,0'J0 at the disposal of Chairman
Janvier of the citizens' committee. The
Governor having made arrangements
for the loan of $100,000 from the fiscal
agents, will turn the money over to the
committee in installments as It is
needed.
Up to noon to-day a dozen cases of
fever had been omcially reported and
the fact that none of these were oases
turned up by the official inspectors, but
cases submitted ( by the doctors them
selves, was again taken as an encourag
ing sign. Dr. White himself is much
pleased with the evidence of improve
ment in the situation.
An unexpected blow was struck at
the Marine Hospital staff to-day when
one of the men sent there to assist
in the fight against the disease waa
himself stricken: The victim is Sur
geon G. M. Berry. Dr. Berry is a Texan
by nativity, but has lately been sta
tioned in New York. He was one of
the first to reach New Orleans and be
cause he had been through the Cuban
campaign and had the fever in Texas
he was considered to be immune ond
was put in charge of the work in the
original infected area, where the fever
raged most fiercely.
Dr. Berry has done yeoman service
in the matter of disinfection. He was
taken ill yesterday, and to-day his
case developed into, one of yellow fever.
He was removed to the Touro. Infirm
ary, where he is expected to speedily
recover. Dr. White has Impressed upon
his surgeons who are to work in the
lorelgn neighborhood the great virtue
ot patience. Many of the Italians and
other residents are unfamiliar with the
methods of the health authorities, and
Dr. White is seeking to treat them with
the leUst possible harshness.
A force of 100 men was engaged in
the work of disinfecting the lower sec
tion of the city to-day. There were S3
patients at thÂ« Emergency Hospital,
.fcteiriier in the campaign, when the
number of cases treated there were con
siderably fewer, the death rate was
high, but it has nbw lessened, and daily
patients are being discharged as cured.
At Patterson, where there are now 30
cases, financial and other assistance is
said to be needed. There has been
considerable spread of the disease
there, and some distress exists among
the poorer classes.
With Surgeon White of the Marine
Hospital Service frankly expressing no
surprise at the increase in the number
of new cases of fever and expecting
that for some time to come there will
be a large quota brought to light daily
the people of New Orleans have made
up their minds to await in patience too
results of the Federal campaign which
is now fairly in swing. The life of a
stegmoyia mosquito has been definitely
ascertained, but the fever had made so
much headway when it was discovered
and it has prevailed so generally in the
lower sections of the city since then
that there are doubtless many of tne
insects which have escaped the disin
fecting crusade launched against them,
and they may be expected to transmit
the disease for some days longer at
least.

"1 do not pretend to have solved the
problem for touring vehicles. That can
only be possible when more charging sta
tions are spread about the country.
Young Cooper Hewitt of New. York has
helped solve that problem with hfs mer
cury rectifier, which takes the place of
the old transformer and makes it m pos
sible to convert the alternating currents
used in small towns so as to make them
available for charging the batteries."
The storage cell is small and encased
In iron. Instead of containing the old
lead plates of the original battery, it con
tains alternate plates of iron and nickel
in a potash lye solution.
"The troubles in the battery I have
been trying for two years to remedy have
been purely mechanical," said Edison.
"They have been greatly due to the
swelling of the nickel element I have
succeeded in reducing the weight of the
battery from forty to forty-five pounds
per horsepower. It has taken time tv
find out what was needed for this bat
tery. We cannot look ahead and see just
what such a thing is going to do after
we have it sketched on paper. In the
two years I have been experimenting we
have turned out some 14,000 cells of the
battery and have operated 160 auto
vehicles.
A small dealer can operate a delivery
wagon with its power at 5S per cent of
the cost of maintaining a horse. An or
dinary automobile will run 100 miles un
der ordinary conditions without recharg
ing. Under the most favorable conditions
150 miles can be covered at a speed of
twenty miles an hour.
More than these facts have been
claimed for the cell by others, but it was
not until yesterday that Edison himself
would even speculate as to the possibili
ties of his new invention. The wizard
has experimented with 14,000 cells to per
fect one. Yesterday, when he made an
nouncement that he is finally satisfied
with the results, he appeared to be as
happy as a schoolboy on a long vacation,
and now, he says, he is going to play
in the woods.
The cell as now perfected will drive a
two-ton truck at a rate of thirty-three
miles an hour with half the weight of the
old method.
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â Thomas A. Edi
son announced yesterday afternoon at his
home in Orange that after two years ot
experimenting he is finally satisfied with
the merits of his new storage battery and
that he will at once begin the erection ot
a factory to manufacture the cells on a
large scale for the trade.
This is the latest, and while not the
greatest of ; the wizard's many inventions,
it is an accomplishment for which many
electricians^ have been striving many
years.

The poet Dryden Is said to have In

â¢ Since becoming chief Chinese officer at this
port two years ago I have given the handling
of these cases my personal attention and con-
So tar aa the complaint of poor quarter* on
Ixi&rd ship or at the detention shed is con
cerned, that is a matter entirely out of the
Jurisdiction of the United States, as the law
has Jeft Chinese applicants in the custody of
the steamship company, whose duty it is to
look after these Chinese until their cases arc
finally disposed of. fortunately, however you
have secured a generous appropriation for the
building at Angel Island, in the bay of San
Franciscc. of a very fine immigrant detection
etation. which in the near future will provide
tnott needful ar.d comfortable accommodations
for detained clafses, as well as all other aliens
In similar condition arriving at this port.
The records of the office show that there
has never been a complaint made by any Chi
nese person seeking- admission here, or by oth
ers in behalf of euch Chinese, alleging harsh
ness or other ill treatment. As is well known
to Â«il CaJlfornlans, at least, the Chinese flo not
scruple et fraud in the attempt to gain admis
tlon to the United 6tatÂ»s; and Xhis service has
always been obliged \o exert the utmost dili
gence and alertness to keep out. such Chinese,
but, to our knowledge, e\-en those guilty or the
grossest frauds have been personally treated
with every consideration. Quite recently, dur
ing a social conversation with two very prom
inent Chinese merchants cf this city. I asked
them whether, in their opinion, many bona
fide merchants bad been denied admission at
this port and I waa Informed that my hearer*
did not know of a single such case where ad
mission had been denied.
The credentials required by the law for the
original admifsinn of Chinese of tbÂ« exempt
cla*Â» t* the United States on m-called Sec
tion Â« papers are issued by Chinese offi
cials in China and are merely vised by Amer
ican consular officers. Such certificates were
originally accepted cs prlma facie evidence of
the risht to land; but. when it was discov
ered that many of the so-called students,
merchant*, travelers, etc., were really coolie
laborers of the lowest order and that almost
any Chineee who could pay for it could tret
a certificate from the Chinese officials, some
Inspection on the other side naturally was
accessary, for which they have only them
eelves to tUar.k.
A* to merchants and others of the exempt
classes who aiÂ« domiciled in the United
States, ar.d who are seeking readmlssion after
visiting- China, those who avail themselves of
the laws and regulations have no cause for
complaint, inasmuch as testimony respecting
their cases may be taken before thtir return
to the United States, or, for that matter, be
f<jrÂ« they leave here, In the event it is so
Â«eslred ,by the Chinese. Those who avail
themselves of this privilege ar.d are leund to
be bons. fide a:e us-ually landed on the Uay
that the steamer docks. The only cases in
which there is delay is of merchants who
live on thÂ« Atlantic seaboard or In the in
terior of the United States.
The enforcement of the Chinese exclusion
Jaw lasted into tS:e hands of the Department
ci Labor and Commerce on July 1, 1903. Con
sequently all present data begin with that
date. For the fiscal year ending June 'M,
UKU, but 403 of the exempt class of Chinese
applied for orlclnal entry at the pert of San
Francisco. Of tfcie number 340 were' landed
end C 3 denied. For the fiscal year
July 1, lfll>s. ST3 of the exempt class applied
for original admission at this port and of
this number Hl9 were landed and 154 denied.
Almost oil tht evidence ror the first of these
fiscal jeare was certificates vised by United
Etates Consul Robert UcWood and all those
during the laxt year received their papers
from him. In this connection you will re
collect that Mr. McWood was removed from
office eoaie months ago. Those denied land
ing also include thoee who were suffering
Irora loathsome and dangerous diseases.
The receipt is acknowledged of your re
<jucst for information as to whether the claim
that has been sometimes made by the Chi

goods TfaÂ» causc-d by harsh treatment inflicted
upon Chinese by the fnited States immigra

President Rocsevelt was requested to as
certain through the Secretaries of State
and Commerce and Labor the reasons
for the boycott and to take steps to have
the same removed; also in the adoption
of a resolution requesting President
Roosevelt to instruct United States Min
ister Rockhill to proceed to Shanghai,
with a committee of three American
merchants residing in Shanghai to be
appointed by the president of the Mer
chants' Exchange there, to ascertain
from the Chinese, through their guilds,
the cause of the boycott and their inten

port by cable the result of their Investi

tion is demanded.
Vice President. G. P. McNear of the ex

drea Sbarboro, Ng Poon Choon, the edi
tor of the Chinege daily paper published
in Ban Francisco; Lv R. Tuttle, who has
represented the house of Geiz Brothers
of this city in China, and Hugh Craig.
Ng Pocn Chew reviewed the history of
Chinese treaties with the United States
and of the enaction of exclusion laws In
this country and said in substance that
while the Chinese Government, displeased
by the exclusion measures, did little for
a time, when the old treaty was to ex
pire the Chinese people openly resented
exclusion. Out of this had resulted the
existing boycott.
The speeches made at the meeting wore
not very long. Outside of those by Mr.
Lilienthal in Introducing the memorial to
President Roosevelt, and the talk by Mr.
Tuttle in advocacy of the resolution sub
mitted by him, the principal remarks
were by Andrea Sbarboro and by Ng
Poon Chew, the Chinese editor. Ng Poon
Chew received the most applause of any
or.c nt the meeting.
Mr. Sbarboro said that all in California
were agreed that employment cannot be
given here to great numbers of Chinese
laborers, and therefore it was right that
they should be excluded. There was no
question on the other hand that those
classes of Chinese who are admitted
under the law can be of value. If there
had been bad handling of the Chinese
merchants and others of the exempt class
that was bad; but it must be admitted
that laborers have been admitted under
false pretenses.
SUBSTANCE OF REMARKS.
federation and therefore feel sure of my posi
tion in the premises. I notice In the
morning news .items an alleged In
terview with a prominent Chinese states
man in Peking, in which he made bitter
complaint that high-class Chinese are some
times placed In the detention shed among com
mon -cooliet". Thin, as I have before explained,
is a matter entirely in the hands 'of the Chi
nese themselves and the steamship companies
bringing them here, as I know no provision of
the law that would prevent any Chinese stop
ping at the best hotels in the town, pending
action, in the case of his being so detained.
It Is simply a question of dollars and cents
between himself and the steamship company
as to what kind of accommodations he hat.
Under the exclusion law the custody of an ar
riving Chinese Is in the hands of the steam
ship company until he is finally landed.
An equally misleading statement, supposed
to have been made by the same Chinese dip
lomat, Is to the effect that the right of counsel
and appeal is denied. As a matter of fact
hardly a Chinese corals here who is not rep
resented by counsel, and in the event of this
being denied landinjr by me he Invariably ap
peals to the department at Washington, where
his case is finally reviewed by the Secretary
of Comnifrpe and I^abrr.

It at a corner, extending north to 21. Thes?
lots are in the southwest quarter of section 2'
What significance the deal may have to the
future operations of the Trinity Copper Com

that the two companies are squaring them
selves around and getting their lands in shape

Alleghany, according to the local papers,
is in a fair way to restore the old time
prestige, of Sierra" County as a producer
of gold on a large scale. Ten compara
tively small Sierra mines have made a
record of producing, in total, gold to tb,6
value of 13,270,000 in round figures. Theso
mines, so reports the Downieville Moun
tain Messenger, _ have hardly become
known beyond the county limits. Sierra
County suffered by the suppression of
hydraulic mining,' by, the exhaustion of
pocket holes, and the set back to Sierra
City by the closing of the Sierra Butte
quartz mine. Population decreased and
mining camps were deserted. Miners
have been driven more to quartz mining
in the lapse of time and owing to en
forced conditions. Present Â« hopes are
based upon the new work and on the rec
ords of certain mines that are considered
by the Messenger, to be Indicative. Some
af the facts quoted by the Messenger fol
lows:
The Sierra Buttes and other lode mines at
Sierra City have produced fully $2i>,oOO,o<X> In
gold, those- of the Alleghany district at least
$7,0u0,000, and mostly from shallow working's
and small â¢\u25a0pockets." At Pike City is the
Alaska, which with a few smaller mines has
output at least a million dollars. There are
others scattered over the country which in
the aggregate will add several more millions to
the record. Most of the mines were reported
"worked out." That 'is why it la -so difficult
to resurrect Sierra County. .
But plnce the Plumbago, near- Alleghany.. was
reported "worked ,gut" ten years ago, it has
produced two and a half millions in gold, and
is to-day looking better than ever; and the
Sierra Buttes mine, after producing $15.WX>,
000 of the yellow precious metal, and be
ing shut down as "worked out," is now being
put in shape lor a production that will ecltjpN
its past record; and now the Tightnor
mine in Alleghany, a property that twenty
years ago was abandoned in Its infancy 'as
"no good," is proving to be a veritable bo
nanza. Within the past two years the mine
has been reopened and prospected, and with a
working force of only three men has paid
the purchase price, $13,000, produced $25,000
besides and has blocked out halt a million
dollars' worth of free milling sold quartz.

only about twenty holes In all were sun*.
One line of fight holes was sunk by OHjb
Preeton of this city, with a crew of pick and
shovel men. The line extended from the river
to the railroad, and the ground averaged about
8 cents. Mr. Grant is of the opinion that
dredging ground will yet be found along tnÂ«*

Concerning recent mining operations
: in the western part of Siskiyou County,
\ the Scott Valley Advance reports:
Mining in the county Is very quiet on ac
count of lack of water to operate the plants
for producing bullion. Most of the work In
mining is developing and getting out ore sup
plies until such time as the fall rains occur.
There are now only five plants in operation
in Western Siskiyou. the numerous others be
ing closed down recently.
. Two keystone drills are now at work, one
On Indian Creek and the other on McAdama
Creek, near Fort Jones. They are under su
pervision of Mr. Cornish of San Francisco
for the company that has bonded these lands
for dredging purposes. J They have about three
thousand acres of land under option in the
valley and will probably install another drill
in the near future, in another locality of thÂ»
valley. Everything looks favorable for Scot*
Valley to become one of the largest dredging
districts of the State, providing the value*
will Justify the investment of the dredgers.
AEW CREEK IX ALASKA.
' Discoveries of importance are re
ported by the Fairbanks Weekly News
to have been recently made in Alaska.
O'Connor Creek, which empties into
Goldstream, below Â»he big Eldo
rado, is credited with the find. Coarse,
gold is reported to have averaged from
$2 to $3 to the pan. The statements in
the News are condensed:
One nugget weighing ?\u25a0* 1" was taken out.
The phenomenal strike was made on No. 4
below. The names of the claim owners could
not be learned. They sank five holes and
struck bedrock nt a depth from 25 to 57 feet.
Pay was found in three of them, and the
paystreak is said to be several feet In depth.
Naturally the news of the strike caused con
siderable excitement. and several persona
started with the intention of staking as near
as possible to the new strike. -This will hayÂ»
the effect of opening this creek immediately.
It has been prospected and considerable of
it has been staked at different times, but very
few holes have been sunk. Since the old
stakes will not hold good unless a discovery
is made within' a reasonable time, there is
likely to be considerable of a' stampede. The
creek offers exceptional operations, because
cf the short distance to bedrock. Nearly all
the nearby creeks average a much greater
dt^th.
The machinery for a sampling plant
at Goldfleld, with a capacity of forty
tons daily, has been secured for the H.
L. Frank Company. It will be used on
high-grade ore when a 200-ton mill is
ready for use. % .

payment into the treasury of the sum
of $6351 60, heretofore received by him
as the percentage allowed by section
XX of the collateral inheritance tax act
upon taxes collected under that act.
Long says he is pleased to have Mc-
Dougald's concurrence in the opinion
heretofore expressed by his office that
such fees are lawfully the property of
the city and county of San Francisco.
Long says he is also convinced that the
Supreme Court of this State will con
firm that view, should an appeal be
prosecuted to that court from the de
cision heretofore rendered in favor of
the city and county in the matter of S.

PACIFIC GROVE, Aug. 11. â A very
serious automobile accident occurred on
the seventeen-mile drive near Carmel
Hill this afternoon. An auto party,
consisting of Mr. and Mrs. John
Breuner and Mr. and Mrs. William
Cluff, parents of Mrs. Breuner, of San
Francisco, were all thrown from the
car to the ground. Mr. Cluff's left leg
was broken just above the ankle and
he is considerably bruised about the
body. The other members of the party
escaped with a few bruises on their
faces and hands.
The Breuner and Cluff parties are
summering at Del Monte. About 2
o'clock this afternoon they took a spin
on the famous seventeen-mile drive.
Mrs. Breuner, formerly Miss California
Cluff, was acting as chauffeur and they
were making good time. All went well
until the sharp grade of Carmel Hill
was reached. On the descent the fair
chauffeur applied more energy to the
machine than was needed and the car
at once became unmanageable, turning
quickly to the side of the road and
dashing down the steep embankment
of about sixty feet. All were thrown
out, and, with the exception of Mr.
Cluff, escaped serious injury.
Luckily for Mr. Cluff. another auto
mobile party happened along about this
time and picked him up and brought
him into town. Dr. Ritchie of Pacific
Grove set and dressed the broken leg.
It is the opinion of the doctor that if
no complications set in the breuk will
soon knit and Mr. Cluff will be around
again. He was taken to San Francisco
to-night on a special train.

slon of the commission it was decided
to give out the names of the students
who had passed the State dental ex
amination. These names have been
withheld ever since the investigation
began, and the eighty-four students
who had applied for licenses have been
on the anxious seat all this time. At
their urgent request the list was pub
lished yesterday. Of the eighty-four
candidates sixty-two have passed.
In giving out the names of the suc
cessful candidates Commissioner Pills
bury said: "It was at the request of
the commission that these names were
held in abeyance. We did not want the
students to. feel that what they said on
the witness stand would be counted
against them. While we have not yet
decided the question, of the culpability
of any members of the board or of any
one else, yet none of these students
were close enough to any unfairness
to cause them to be punished for the
actions of others. I am giving these
names out, also, for the reason that
the Attorney General told me that as
they had once been put on the records
of* the board they were legally the
property of the students."
SUCCESSFUL DENTAL STUDENTS.
"No," replied Dr. Baird, "nothing of the
kind. We ; would! have had the investi
gation at any time that Dr. Cool had
shown us any proofs." .
Then followed the letters of Drs. Dunn
and Cool asking .for a special meeting.
Dr. Baird said that the first meeting was
held as Dr. Baird, requested; and that at
that time, there were no proofs offered
which warranted the examination.
Attorney > Lukens questioned theÂ»wit
ness with the evident Intention of show
ing that. Drs. Dunn and Cool were not
given a chance and. that the records were
badly kept by Dr. Herrick.
At the morning session Dr. J. F. Steele
swore \u25a0 that he had not made the remark
that- he had paid $150 for a license, as
was stated by Dr. Brooks on Thursday.
The commission â wlllv meet again on
Monday -.morning. .' . \u25a0
â¢ '"Then* Cool came viÂ» to where we were
standing. Mayhew told him that he would
not regignâ he had done only his duty.
â¢All right.' said* Dr. Cool, .'then this be
comes . a : - public matter.* "
At the conclusion of Dr. Baird's testi
mony came the questioning in regard to
the two meetings of the board which were
adjourned before the matter could be in
vestigated. Dr. Baird said that these
were Informal meetings, and that Dr.
Cool did not produce the evidence to war
rant an investigation." He would not give
us those affidavits."
"Do -I understand that you five mem
bers of this State Board of Dental Exam
iners held this informal meeting because
you knew that no record would be made
of It, and that you would rather have had
no investigation at all, than to have had a
record of it in the minutes?" asked Com
missioner Plllsbury.
MAYHEW DECLINES TO RESIGN.
â¢â¢ 'Dr. Balrd,' he said, 'Mayhew's ques
tions have been given out in advance. 1
have three affidavits to that effect. That
man must resign from this board at once
or I will have the examinations stopped
and the information in the hands of the
Governor by 2 o'clock this afternoon. We
must, reorganize this board. I am as
much entitled to the presidency as though
it were an inheritance. I am an old prac
titioner and entitled to the place.'
'â¢ 'You must see Herrick and fix It up.
If you don't I will publish stories about
yon that will kill you. There has been a
complaint I chargingyou with criminal
libel, filed with a lawyer of this city for
some time, and it was I who kept him
from starting the proceedings. Don't put
any faith in Mayhew. He is telling on
you. You think that I am a friend of
Dunn. I did not speak to him for five
years until he came on this board.
If you don't fix this up the suit will
cost you $500 and ruin you whether \t
succeeds or not.' V
"I was astonished at these things com
ing from Dr. Cool. In the first place I
did not think that Dr. Mayhsw was
guilty, and the threats -against me
seemed, monstrous. 'I will do my duty,"
I told that man. and with that I left the
room. Previous to this I had said that
we could consult Drs. White and How
ard. 'No,', he said, 'they are not fit to
be on. this board.'
,"I went right down and found Dr. May
hew. He denied the charge made* by Cool
and at that time he 'told me that the
only persons that he had given the ques
tions to were Drs. Dunn and Cool, and
at their request. He told me that Dr.
Cool. had taken them away and that Dr.
Dunn had .examined them in his pres
ence. . I
The most important feature of Dr.
Balrd's testimony yesterday was his
statement that he had seen Dr. Mayhew
on the day of the anatomy examination
and that Dr. Mayhew had told Dr. Baird
at that time that he had given the ques
tions to Drs. Dunn and Cool at their re
quest, and that no one else had seen
them before they were put upon the
blackboard. This strengthened the sworn
testimony of Dr. Mayhew, who stated this
fact at Thursday's session, and cast a
suspicion on the testimony of Drs. Dunn
arid Cool, who passed the lie direct-to
Dr. Mayhew by swearing that they had
not seen the written questions until the
day that they were shown to the board.
"It was" on the morning of the anatomy
examination that some one told me that
Dr. Cool wanted to see me," said Dr.
Baird. "I found Dr. White and we went
down to the dental supply room of Dr.
Coke, on the floor below. There I met Dr.
Cool, and he said that he wanted to see
me alone. I told him that he could say
whatever he' wanted to before Dr. White,
but he was so persistent that he should
see me alone that I yielded and went Into
a private office. He shut the door and
locked it, then turned to me and said:
'What are you afraid of? I am not going
to smash you in the face. Why are you
so nervous? 1 I told him that I did not
see anything to be afraid of and that I
was far from nervous. .
SEEK TO SHOW UXFAmNESS.
During the daj&the "solid five" attempt
ed to show the hatred of Drs. Dunn and
Cool toward them and to clear any of
their number of the charges of unfairness
or fraudulent giving out of questions' in
advance of the anatomy examination. On
the other hand, the "solid two" endeav
ored to show that the affairs of the board
were carried on unfairly by Dr. Balrd
and that Secretary Herrick had not done
his work well.
Dr. F. G. Duird, president of the
board, directly charged Dr. Cool rvlth
threatening; Dr. Mnyhew and himself
with ruin unless the board was reor
su nixed, Dr. Mayhew gone and him
self nt the hmd as president. These
Btatrmentii were made under oath anil
with deliberation by Dr. Balrd. Thin
wns the Nensnttonnl testimony at yes
terday's sewalon. It took the commis
sion by surprise. /
Dr. Cool was not there to hear the
charges made against him. He had been
excused by: Commissioner Pillsbury after
the adjournment of the commission last
night. Attorney Brann, acting for the
"solid, five," lodged a formal action
against the absence of Dr. Cool and
asked that an adjournment be made un
til his return, but the commission decided
against him. _.'.;\u25a0'" .

R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of
trade to-morrow will say:
"Trade reports are less uniformly
favorable, but adverse conditions are of
a temporary nature, and the net result
for the week is satisfactory. Numerous
failures have occurred, exerting the
customary pernicious influence over
business, and the epidemic of yellow
fever is restricting Southern trade. On
the ether hand, thr- normal conditions
have facilitated retail trade, crop pros
poets have greatly improved and out
of-town buyers are numerous in all the
leading markets. Manufacturing plants
are active, the textile mills still occu
pying the strongest position. Railway
earnings in July were 7.4 per cent
greater than in the same month last
year, and foreign commerce {it this port
lor the last week showed an Increase
of ?3,317,390 in imports, while exports
decreased $1,345,325. Little change has
occurred in the financial situation, rates
ruling easy, while prices of securities
have risen close to the highest point
on record. Bank exchanges in New
York for the week were. 47.B per cent
lars^r^han last yÂ«~ar, and at other lead
ing cities the increases amounted to
14.1 i\er cent.
NEW YORK. Aug. U.-Dispatches to
R. G. Dun & Co. indicate that trade has
Improved in the aggregate, although some
drawbacks are found, particularly at the
South and because of labor controversies
in several different localities. Shipyards,
carshops and electrical supplies are busy,
and makers of cheap jewelry have large
orders. Pittsburg reports a quiet mar
ket for dry goods, but hardware is more
active.
The loss of the provisions was seriously
felt, and but for the stores left by the
Baldwin-Ziegler expedition in Teplitz Bay
the* men would have been- in bad straits.
In the following spring continued at
tempts were made eastward^ and west
ward to. force a passage to the pole. The
conditions, however, were insurmount
able. The expedition met with . much
open water and day after day encoun
tered fresh dangers and difficulties. Ul
timately the supply' of provisions began
to give out and a painful journey south
ward was begun, the members of the ex
pedition finally reaching the depots at
Cape Flora, Cape Dillon and Camp Zieg
ler, among which they were distributed
and where they managed to eke out the
limited supplies by catches of walrus and
bear.
TROMSOE, Norway, Aug. 11.â The re
lief steamer Terra Nova, which succeed
ed In rescuing Anthony Fiala and' the
other members of the Zlegler polar ex
pedition, arrived here to-day. She 'sailed
from Tromsoe June 14 last, shapingVier
course direct for the ice fields, which
were encountered" June 19 in latitude 75
degrees 97 minutes north, longitude 36
degrees 26 minutes east. The condition of
the ice being favorable the ship proceed
ed eastward along the edge of the field
until June 27, when it commenced to
force its way through the floe, and on
July 25 struck ofcen water.
Thick ice was again encountered the
following day, but on the morning of July
2S Palml Island was sighted, and on July
29 the Terra Nova reached Cape Dillon,
where she found six members of the ex
pedition safe and well. From this out
post sleds were dispatched to notify Fiala
at the headquarters camp of the arrival
of the rescue shipJ
The Nova reached Cape Flora July 30
and found more members of the expedi
tion. These had become weakened by
the hardships they, endured and some of
tTiem were so ill that they could not have
held out for many months. Returning to
Cape Dillon, Mr. Champ, who command
ed the relief expedition, organized a party
and started for the headquarters camp,
from which he brought back Fiala and
his comrades.*
The Terra Nova sailed for home August
1. It got out of the ice pack August 6
and returned in excellent condition. /The
members of the Zlegler expedition tell a
stirring story of their vain efforts to
reach the pole. In the severe weather
of November, 1903, the ship America,
which carried the expedition, broke up
and the provisions and coal were lost.
Part of the wreckage remained until
/anuary 22, 1904, when it disappeared dur
ing a storm.
! Before the fire was under control six
of the firemen had been carried to the
hospital and many others of the wound
ed were barely able to walk. The loss
was estimated at about $60,000.
NEW YORK. Aug. 11. â Twenty fire
men were carried, burned and uncon
scious from boiling soap, five of them
very badly parboiled, from a firÂ© In W.
H. D&gg\tt's Sons' soap factory In West
One Hundredth and Twentieth street to
day. Tanks containing: 70.000 gallons
of soap fats exploded after a fire In the
three-story building; had been brought
under control. For five, hours thereaft
er firemen fought this new danger,
crawling 1 on their stomachs on side
walks outside the building;, unable to
stand in a poisonous flood of smoko
which exhaled from the fiery soap
greases and continually exposed to lit
tle rivers of the scorching Quid which
flowed from the building. "Water
seemed for the first three hours to have
no effect whatever on the burning soap
fats other than to cause them to flow
more freely, with greater peril to the
fighters.
After the vats had taken fire Acting
Chief Blnns was forced to divide his
men into two parties, one to enter the
black' smoke cloud with the hose and
the other to stand waiting out In the
air to rush In and rescue fainting com
rades, whose cries for help came from
the fiery furnace every few moments.
The black smoke was even more dead
ly than the fat grease, and sometimes
the men lying flat on their faces were
forced to inhale it by the constant
back draughts.
In no case did the injured firemen
come from a single experience in the
smoke and grease, but from repeated
dashes into the fire zone after having
been dragged out helpless by com
rades. ' A physician was among the
rescue brigade and by first aid treat
ment succeeded In reviving some of the
firemen. Several firemen who were
taken out unconscious and restored to
their senses refused to obey orders to
go to the hospital, but ran back to
their posts of duty. For an hour Fred
Barry fought the fire from the cellar
with the scalding grease trickling over
him. As he fell his strength gave out.
He screamed for help and Chief Howe.
In another part of the building, heard
him. Barry was found unconscious on
the ground and was removed to the
hospital. Fireman O'Xeill sustained
the most serious Injuries. When the
first vat, containing 10,000 gallons of
soap liquid, exploded, several mem
bers of Company IS were so near that
the explosion knocked them down. They
ran out of the building, not knowing
that O'Neill, who was one of the party,
was left behind. He was quickly miss
ed and searchers found him lying on a
stairway in a small case of soap grease.

"I have just complained without satis

UNFAIRNESS ALLEGED
IN FEDERAL WORK
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11.â Secretary
Bonaparte of the navy after careful con
sideration has decided that the final in
terment of John Paul Jones at Annapolis
shall not take place until some time next
spring. He has been helped to this de
cision by the fact that the buildings
there will then be completed, and also
by the fact that the French nation has
expressed a desire to participate in the
ceremony by sending to this country a
squadron of its ships.
His announcement was made this af
ternoon. In this connection Assistant
Secretary Darling has found it necessary
to call the attention of several naval of
ficers to the use of certain words in their
reports in connection with this matter.
Several of them have spoken of the oc
casion as a "celebration" and this is
hardly in accord with the obsequies.
Since his admonition they will use "cere
mony't or "ceremonials," when speaking
of the exercises attendant on the bring
ing of the remains to this country and
their interment at Annapolis.
In order to make definite what a
captain might request in the way of
the giving of time, a note has been ap
pended to the rule, which states that
the linesman shall notify the captains
of the time remaining to play not more
than ten nor less than five minutes be
fore the end of each half, to the effect
that there is no objection to the lines
man giving the approximate time to
the captain who asks for it at any time
during the game. He may not. how
ever, be asked for this time more than
three times within the last five minutes
of the half.
Couching from the side lines will be
penalized, by a loss of ten yards instead
of five.
A rule has also been made that when
a substitute is sent "in he cannot run on
to the field and get into the lineup, but
must go directly to the referee and re
port himself before he can be permitted
to take his place. This is to do away
with the tendency at times when a
substitute was sent in of having both
the substitute and the man he was to
replace playing in the game at one and
the same time. 'r % -
"Instruction Is given to the referee
to blow his whistle immediately when
the forward progress of the ball has
been stopped. This has been done In
order to lessen the tendency to fight for
the bull after its progress has been
stopped, or to steal it from a player
who has practically had it "down."
Legislation has also been directed at
any players who are out of bounds at
the time when the ball Is put in play,
and a rule has been made that no
player shall be out of bounds at the
time when the ball is put in play, ex
cept the man who is holding the ball
for a place- kick.
Under rule 6, relating to a scrim
mage, a distinction has been made be
tween act of the snapper-back and act
of any other players of the side in pos
session of the ball. If the snapper
back make a motion as if to snap the
ball, whether he withholds it or not. the
ball is regarded as in play and the
scrimmage begins. If any other player
of the side in possession of the. bull
makes an attempt by a false start to
draw the opponent offside and the ball
is then snapped it shall be brought back
and not be regarded as in play or the
scrimmage commenced.
The changes in the football rules for
1905, of which there are quite a num
ber, for the most part bear upon more
strict interpretation rather than any
thing that will affect the detail of the
play itself.

Champion Egan gained the right to
defend his medal by going through the
third and semi-final rounds like a mar

morning, 2 up and 1 to play, which was
not quite as easy a game as he had
with this young New Yorker in the na
tional finals last year at Baltusrol.
After defeating llerreshoff, Egan, in
the afternoon, removed Harold Weber
of Toledo by the crushing score of 7 up
and 5 to play.
It was left for UÂ»e other side of the
draw to furnish the greatest blow to
the East when W. C Fownes Jr. of
Pittsburg eliminated former national
and British champion Walter J. Travis
in a hard ba-ttle that was lost only at
the nineteenth hole. In the afternoon

been better demonstrated than in Oakland. It
Is the women of this city that started the
movement for clean streets and directly and
indirc-ctjy they are responsible for many Im

success along civic as well as philanthropic

primarily for the purpose of growing model

opportunity to teach one student by means of
a farm, than to show one hundred persons a
field of perfect pumpkins.
Then there came the passage of the Hatch
act in I&R7. which cstablithed the experiment
Â»t*tionÂ«; and this afforded a means of utiliz
ing the college farm. Thrre are Â« good many
of our Institutions which are now carrying
farm lands as experiment stations. Of course

Y^ar *:;â¢ r next will be celebrated tha fiftieth
anniversary ot the agricultural college near
Lansing. Mich. The first agricultural colleges
wÂ«-re eÂ£tÃ.b!if*ht*l as a protest against the older
kind of education that did not put men into
touch with real affairs. The land grant act
of lÂ«Â«2i marks one of the greatest epochs in
the history of education; it is the M&gna
Charta of education. Its purpose was to give
instruction in these subjects and. affaire which
have to do with rÂ«-al life. And what are
they? Tkef are largely agriculture ar.d the
mecaanicaj arts. As theÂ«e agricultural col
leges were largely a pretest against the older
education, it was perfectly natural that at
first they shouid be separate Institutions.
About one-half of the agricultural colleges
of the Union are separate from the universities
proper. They are doing good work, and I am
eaying nothing whatever derogatory' to them.
There are some res sons still given for having
F*-parate agricultural colleges. It is said that
other courses will attract thr young men from
the farm. Now, if the agricultural college
can't hold the young men it ought to lose
them: the time is past when we shall put
blinders on the young men. Again, it is paid
that the farm boy will be looked down on. but
rtudents will not lock \u25a0inwn uiÂ«on him If his
\u25a0work is of equally high grade as that pursued
In other courses. Sometimes the agricultural
college iÂ» wanted in a **parate locality to fcat
isfy lo*-al pride. A locality wants to have an
agri cultural, college and offers inducements to
g^t It. Tills does not consider the merits of
the <~sse. In somÂ» cases a broom factory might
b*- just as satisfying to the community. The
university idea is <-oming to be a unifying idea
in th* community, and all university work
i>hou!d be kept together. The time is past
when th* agricultural college phrmld be torn
out of the university and be fet off by itself.

BERKELEY, Aug. 11.â Investigation of
the report that attempts had been made
to destroy with dynamite the big "C," on
Grizzly Peak, back of the university,
revealed to-day the fact that an explosive
of high' power unquestionably had been
taken to the site of the big "C," and that
practically successful demolition of the
famous symbol on the hMI had been ac
complished.
B. Klein, heading a party of freshmen,
visited the place to-day and found a
stick of dynamite there, which they
turned over to the university authori
ties. The freshmtn also found a hand
kerchief, near the stick of dynamite,
bearing the initials "F. G." The hand
kerchief is expected to serve as a clew
in the Investigation that will be made of
the affair.
While no direct accusation will be made
by any person concerned, the idea is ex
pressed that Stanford men who attended
tht; summer school,' and who became em
broiled with the publishers of the Uni
versity Record during the summer, are
responsible for the use of dynamite on
the big "C." \
The Stanford students in question were
charged by Walter de Leon, in a Record
editorial, with using their opportunities
as guests of the University of California,
to Induce "prep." school men to go to
Stanford rather than to Berkeley. The
Stanford men came back with a rejoinder
that glowed with heat, and for weeks the
controversy waged, ending with both
sides apparently full of bitterness.
. The finding of dynamite on the hill, and
the partial destruction of the big "C" have
revived this animosity.
Freshmen now at the university will ar
range for the restoration of the cement,
which has been blown out of the concrete
letter. The big "C" was built last spring,
to take the- place of the annual Charter
Day rush, on Grizzly Peak. The fresh
men class numerals were placed below
the letter and it was planned to make a
pilgrimage" each year to the big "C."
annually inscribing beneath it the numer
als of the freshmen class. The letter is
made of cement and is 60 by 30 feet in
dimensions.
The mutilation of the coupon made it
impossible for any one to cash the prize
that the number on the ticket had won.
At the preliminary hearing before thy
board, the Chief and the company's
agents were reinforced by State Senator
Eddie I. Wolfe of San Francisco and
State Senator G. R. Lukens of this city,
who appeared as attorneys to help in an
explanation of the circumstances. Ever
since that appearance the Commissioners
have held the matter in abeyance. The
understanding has been that Com
missioner Turner was unable to see
anything heinous in Hodgkins' ac
tion, and that Mayor Mott was
not ready to submit the case for a
final decision. The Mayor has said re
peatedly that he did not like the aspect
of the affair, and that he had not dropped
it by any means.
Hodgkins confessed his part in the de
struction of the coupon; the numbers on
which were torn off in his presence by
agents of the company while it was still
In the hands of the police as evidence
against Perry. The excuse made by
Hodgkins was that he was thoughtless in
permitting the lottery people to get hold
of the ticket. He denied that any finan
cial gain had resulted to himself from the
transaction.
In hig explanations to-day. Chief Hodg
kins Insists that the only; time he ever
conversed with Mrs. Harrison was for a
few minutes In the city prison,. when, the
Chief says, the woman /declared she ha<J
been told that he was responsible for hvr
Imprisonment.
On the other hand, Mrs. Harrison em
phatically declared Hodgkins visited her
house as she has related, and that there
are at least two witnesses to prove the
truth of her statements. So far as the
commission is concerned the official at
titude toward this latest scandalous out
break in the police department is set
forth by Mayor Mott, who as president
of the board said to-day:
"So far as Mrs. -Harrison's charges are
concerned they will receive the attention
of the board. Until a hearing can be had
I shall not express any opinion. Chief of
Police Hodgkins will be given ample op
portunity of defense."
Commissioner McElroy has expressed
himself as in favor of an investigation.
The third member, Commissioner Turner,
also believed there should be an inquiry.
The board will probably wait until the
regular meeting next Wednesday morn
ing before taking official action on the
charges.
The matter of Chief Hodgkins* action
several weeks ago in allowing agents of a
San Francisco lottery company to muti
late a $7500 prize winning lottery ticket
that was seized from John Perry, a Wect
Oakland saloon-keeper, before the drawing
has not been disposed of by the Police
Commissioners.
All of the Police Commissioners agrse
that there should be an investigation.
The publicity which has been given to
Mrs. Harrison's statements, coming so
soon after -the recently discussed prize
lottery ticket mutilations, which Hodg
kins permitted, has created an uneasy at
mosphere at police headquarters. The
Chief of Police has declared that he will
be prepared in a day or two to disprove
the accusation of extortion. He has not
said what he will present in making his
defense before his superiors. He declares
his purpose to ask the Commissioners for
an early hearing.
OAKLAND, Aug. 11.â The Board of
Police and Fire Commissioners will take
up the investigation of the charges made
by Mrs. D. 11. Harrison, a midwife at
1772 Goss street, that she paid $1000 to
Chief of Police Hodgkins to "square" a
case in which she had been arrested un
der suspicion of having caused the death
of Mrs. Jennie Biroth. Hodgkins to-day
reiterated his denials that , he had ever
received money from Mrs. Harrison, or
had ever been at her residence for any
purpose.

the drainage on a farm in order to teach it,
I want to be able to do it. The botanist
pulls up the plant to study it. In learning
how to grow potatoes one should pull them
up and etudy the root system. Not long ago
I was asked how deep potatoes should be
planted In a certain soil. I asked. "How
many of you know whether the tubers form
above or below the feeding roou?" Four or
five guessed, but no one knew. But on that
fact depends much of the success in planting
potatoes. If your ntudents want to see a
model orchard, they have a thousand of them
in California. We want such an establish
ment as will allow us to drive our cattle
right into the class room. We are this day
buildir.s a class room at Cornell which will
hold stock, and which has seats for the stu
dents on the sides. They will study real live
cattle, not pictures and models. The young
men study those cows and find out why they
are pood and bad cows. They examine their
conformation, etc. . These cows are just as
much laboratory material as the plants of the
botanist cr the chemicals of the chemist. Next
week. If we should be studying the question
of bc-ef tattle, they are brought into the build
ing and students study them just the same
way your students study the" stratification of
rocks. Ten acres of land to use when I want
It, and as I want It, Is worth more peda
gugically than a thousand acres to look at.
The value of a university farm from a unl
vei-Fity man's point of view consists in lte
usefulness as a means of teaching. If you
do not want to call It a farm, call it land.
The better it is as a farm, the better It
ought to be as a laboratory: but the labora
tory utilization of it should always come
first. If you are not using farms as a means
of training men you are not using them for
university purposes. A director of an agri
cultural college said some years ago when a
vjritor complained that he didn't consider the
college farm to bÂ» a mode! farm, "I would
rather have a good man with a flower pot In
a window than have a poor man with a thous
and acres of land.." A university farm justi
fied from the university or pedagogical point
of view niUFt be made a true laboratory to
co.late and articulate with thÂ© theoretical in
struction, otherwise the future will not Justify
your possession of it.

Prohibitionist* to Hold Conference.
A, convention and conference of the
prohibition' workers will be held at
Long: Beach on September 2S, 2i> and 00,
the object being rather a school of
methods than an attempt to make a
public I demonstration. Special paper*
will be read, a conference of county
chairmen will- be held and debates on
prohibition reform will take place be
tween the leading prohibition speakers,
Good Templar lodges. Woman's Chris
tian Temperance unions and prohibi
tion alliances have been invited to send
delegates. It is believed that every
delegate will receive great practical
good from the meetings and that an im
pulse will be given to temperance work
of all kinds in Southern California.
The Roanoko belonged to A. Sewall &
Co., owners of the Shenandoah and othor
famous sailing vessels. Built in 1592,
Tias had rather more than one ship's
share of misfortune. It is not very long
ago that she was badly charred by lire at
J^sonolulu, and on a recent voyage from
Australia hrr commander committed sui
cide by jumping overboard. She had a bad
name among sailor?, who believed she
sailed under the ban of an unshakable
hoodoo. She was a vessel of 3539 tons
register, was 311.2 feet long, -19.2 feet beam
and 29.2 feet deep.
The clipper sh!p Roanoke has been dr
Â«troye>l by flames. While loading o:e Bt
Noumea, in New Caledonia, for Delaware
Breakwater this line American vessel
took fire and burned to the water's edge.
This much was learned yesterday from a
brief dii-patch received f;om London at
the Merchants' Exchange. As there was
no mention of loss of life it is supposed
that all hancs arc safe.
The Roanoke was well known at thi's
port and was famous tho world over as
one of the finest of probably the hand
somest mailing ship fleet in* the world.
She vras a four-masted wooden ship,
with lofty and gracefully tapering spars
and z. shapely hull. She was a typical
American clipper, and in any kind 01
weather always had siven a good ac
count of herself.

SIMPLICITY Is the keynote of the modes for misses and children; and this
smart little frock in a mercerized chambray has much to commend It.
The bodice is a clever combination of yoke and suspender style,. the yoke
of guipure embroidery, pointed front and back and the. bretelles coming: up
fiom the satin ribbon girdle that" is mounted upon a featherbone ; frame.
The sleeve Is puffed to above the elbow, where It Is strapped with embroid
ery, .and, two fluffy, frills of this same hang halfway to the elbow and finish
the sleeve. The skirt Is full, shirred to the band, and has two flounces of
embroidery applied \ with much shirring from knee to hem. The length is
the correct onej the skirt hem coming barely, to the top, of the shiny black
shoe, but not displaying the smart hosiery.

SHARK riding is a newly invented sport indulged in by the
yachtsmen of Oyster Bay, and said to be more exciting than
motor-boating. That the sharp-toothed terror of the sea, the
mention of whose name is sufficient to send shudders down the
spinal column, can thus be used to subserve the gayety and exhil
aration of humanity is a noteworthy advance in the completeness
of man's dominion over the earth and all the creatures that inhabit
it. To disarm him of his terrors to the extent of actually making
a plaything of him must be such a triumph to the sportsmen it is
no surprise that the excitement of the game added to its novelty
makes it the finest experience of the summer's fun. When sharks
are made useful and amusing it is time to wonder what next. *
The sport is made easy from the very fact that sharks have
grown bold because of the fright they inspire. The men-go out in
boats and harpoon them. The harpoon is attached with a short line
to the boat and the stimulated fish dashes off at a great burst of
speed, pulling the boat after him. It is said that you have-to hold
on to the seat of the boat very tightly in order to keep up with the
pace. The fun would be very dangerous but for the fact that the
shark has a habit of skimming along the surface of the water: If
ever he took a notion to dive straight down he could make it very
interesting for his riders, and soon have better sport than they.
Upsetting the boat would be just the beginning of his gayety,
for when he chose to come up again things would be easily his way,
and revenge and good eating would conjoin to make him-happy. -It
will be lucky for the riders so long as the fish's instinct predom
inates over his reason; but the bare possibility that at some moment
he may undertake to change his tactics and try a sudden downward
curve must add greatly to the thrills of the adventurers.
A NEW SPORT.
Dumas perc, who was proud of the
prices he received for his work, was once
boasting of the fact.
"Beyond a doubt," he remarked, "1
am the best paid of living men of let
ters; I receive thirty sous a line."
"Indeed, monsieur?" said a bystander,
"I have never worked for less than 5000

ANECDOTE OF DUMAS.
IT Is rather a pity that the new Coun
tess of Northbrook will not go out
to any extent this season, for she
is regarded as one of the most beautiful
women in London society, writes the
London correspondent of The Call. The
Countess and her husband are still In
mourning for the Earl of Northbrook,
and will content themselves during the
next few months with very small din
ner parties at their town house in Pdrt
man Square.
It was not until after her second
marriage that London "discovered" the
Countess. As the wife of that retiring
Scotch "laird," Sir Robert Abercromby,
she went little into society, either north
or south of the Tweed. But when the
then Viscount Baring won the fair
widow and brought her to London as
his bride her beauty immediately be
came talked of on every side. Pos
sessed of wonderful fair hair and a radi
ant complexion she was admittedly, the
belle of her first party in London â an
uncommonly swagger function at Dev
onshire House, at which both the King
and Queen, then Prince and Princess of
Wales, were present.
London, however, was not allowed to
see much of the Viscountess, and this
on account of the affection for and de
pendence upon her Ladyship of her
father-in-law, the Earl of Northbrook.
Never was there a more Idolized daugh
ter-in-law. The Earl* had fifty differ
ent portraits of her, which he was
never tired of showing. The old noble
man's devotion was fully reciprocated
by its object, and during the last years
of the Earl's life the Viscountess spent
most of her time with him at his coun
try home in Hampshire and shone ttfere
as the most brilliant hostess in the
county, arranging the shooting parties
entirely herself and superintending tho
smallest details in connection with the
comfort of her father-in-law's guests.
Lady Northbrook^s jewels are likely
to make a small sensation when she
begins to go out again, for, besides
her own collection of turquoises, which
is almost priceless, she has now come
Into the family jewels of the North
brook family, some of which have be
longed to the Darings since the time of
Henry VII.
Her Ladyship is now busy rehanging
and reframing the Northbrook paint
ings, which were the pride of her
father-in-law and which are"considered
the finest collection of old pictures In
England. The new Earl of Northbrook
is a prominent club man, has been a
member of Parliament and was aid-de
camp to his father when he was Gover
nor General of India. The Countess's
son by her first husband, little "Bob
ble Abercromby, is one of the comell
est children in society. His picture ap
peared a few years ago In the Royal
Academy and was greatly admired.
KBW' COUXTESS OF !VOHTHUROOK AND HER SON.
This was regarded as a heinous offense, though the public was
amply protected against the pauperism of the children, and it is
ordered that the steamship company shall be prosecuted in the
3 ; ederal courts and be subjected to heavy penalties for bringing
these children, in charge of a responsible Bishop of their church,
to a good home. Our opinion of some of the policies of the Mormon
church is well known. But one thing must be admitted in behalf
of the Mormon body: it cares for the needy and helpless, and does
not leave them to public charity.
The question arises, if a Bishop of any other church, having
a hierarchy, had landed here with children under the same circum
stances, would his charges have been ordered dep.orted by the same
immigration authorities? We doubt it. But the Mormons have in
respect to such cases exactly the same legal rights as any other
church. Therefore it is apparent either that other churches are un
lawfully favored or that the Mormons are denied legal equality
of right. Applying the principles of equity to the administration
of the law. the right of those orphan children cannot be questioned.
Bin they were denied the benefits of both law and equity. For
what ? As a punishment because their parents were Mormons, or be
cause it is the settled policy of the immigration authorities to do all
that they can to hinder and oppress American shipping at this port?
In attempting to visit the penalties upon an inadvertence, public
authority is being outrageously misused. If rights are denied to
the Mormons that are freely accorded to others, it is a violation of
the Federal constitution, which forbids discrimination between dif
ferent forms of religio^j.
It is a part of the unfriendly attitude toward the interests of
navigation that is assumed here. The men who invest capital and
enterprise in shipping are treated as if they were public enemies.
Their property is discriminated against by being subjected to all
local taxation, which foreign bottoms escape, and they carry pas
sengers between Asian and Australasian ports and this city at their
peril. Yet on the Fourth of July we boast of the flag and fondly
hope to see it at the peak of American ships in all the waters of the
world! Shipping companies are prosecuted in the Federal courts
for inadvertence, and the national authorities seem to exhaust all
of their zeal in hindering and hampering the use of the Pacific
Ocean, which a Cabinet officer proclaimed had been made an Ameri
can lake by Dewey's victory in Manila Bay.
Not long ago a Pacific liner brought here four orphan children.
They were in charge of a well known Bishop of the Mormon church,
their parents having been of that, faith. He gave the guarantee of
the church that they would not become a public charge. A home
and adoption were waiting for them in Idaho. But notwithstanding
all this these orphans were ordered deported. They were mere
children, the oldest being only n years of age. By inadvertence
and without design they were landed, went on to Idaho and were
adopted into a family of large property, abundantly able to rear
and educate them.
The administration of the law should be impartial and its policy
should be the same for all. The law does not put a head tax upon
tourist aliens in transit through the country. But notwithstanding
that, at this port the head tax is imposed upon tourists, regularly
ticketed on trips around the world, making necessary their transit
across the United States. These tourists are not immigrants. Their
prcFcr.ce in the country is temporary, and it is oppressive to compel
our Pacific Ocean steamship companies to pay this unlawful head
tax. It shows a lack of discrimination in the administration of the
law. and is a special incubus upon the passenger trade across the
Pacific, which San Francisco is so desirous of attracting to this
port.
THE administration of all law should be tempered by equity.
The general policy of our immigration laws is less strict than
it should be. It should not only treat the people of all nations
rlike, but it should aim to restrict immigration down to the point
indicated by the industrial needs of the country. But then even
the principle of equity should temper the enforcement of the law.
Its administrators should play no favorites, either on the score of
race or religion.
It is one proper purpose of the law to exclude all immigrants
whosare not in some way guaranteed against becoming a public
charge. How little attention is paid to this in Eastern ports the
facts testify. The philanthropic heart of the country is wrung by
the tales o"f want and distress among the immigrants on the East
Side in Xew York. Instead of being two years in the country with
out being a public charge, a percentage of every year's excessive
immigration goes on the pauper list within six months or a year
after landing. This fact makes all the more noticeable the stern
ness of the immigration officers in cases in which the public is amply
guaranteed against the helplessness and pauperism of other classes
of immigrants.

pour the contents on the graceless head

Nevertheless, the chump still dis

Then did the great, wise andtalented

The tragedies of real life hidden within
these peculiar cases, if they could but be
brought to life, would rival many of the
novels penned by the world's greatest
writers. No subject that can be imagined
has such weird fascination as that of the
thousands and thousands who have gone
down this grand canyon of oblivion.
It would be possible to flil many pages
with the absorbing stories of these curi
ous cases, but nearly every reader of the
newspapers, whether he live in village,
town or city, is probably acquainted with
some instance of the kind concerning
either friend er relative. Men and women
who have lost all they treasured most In
life in this manner go about vacantly,
numbly, ever waiting for the return of
the missing oneâ a dream that never
comes true.â Philadelphia Inquirer.
More than 5000 persons annually disap
pear in the United States and are never
heard from again. At flrst blush the as
sertion seems incredible, but police sta
tistics furnish confirmation. The actual
figures based on a conservative calcula
tion are even more alarming than those
given. In fact, the reports of the police
departments of the larger cities show that
in the twelve months just passed 16.00S of
the persons who disappeared during the
year were never reported as found, but
the whrewd police officers, accustomed to
the eccentricities of human nature, are
of the opinion that the return of many
thousands of thfse persons, through
shame or indifference, was never reported
at police headquarters. But even after
making allowance for this feature of the
case it is reasonably certain that more
than 5000 persons were swallowed up in
oblivion. â¢

Mrs. Chandler said Melbourne's Royal
Park covers 600 acres. In speaking ot
California as one beautiful garden Mrs.
Chandler regretted that commercialism
was sweeping the old-fashioned gar
dens away to make room for flats, a
condition that will compel lovers of
horticulture to take to window garden
ing.
A poem, "My Mother's Garden." was
read by Mrs. Hodgkins. Mrs. J. Leach

The State Floral Society held a meet
ing yesterday in Elks' Hall, Sutter
street, Mrs. I* O. Hodgkins in the
chair. Mrs. Austin Sperry spoke of the
respect shown flower growers in Port
land,-where roses may bloom with im
punity and safe from being picked by
wayward vandals. The law, said Mrs.
Sperry, condemns a flower thief to pay
a penalty of $25 for each flower un-
lawfully annexed by him. -
Mrs. Hodgkins here declared that she
was no politician, but she could- but
say that if good men were at the head
of all civic affairs in San Francisco
things would be different. Men, she
held, should lay aside party feeling and
stand together, shoulder to shoulder,
for the city's welfare, and in that case
everything would be safe.
Mrs. Sperry regretted that . "com
mercialism kills the city." Justice is
what is needed, said Mrs. Sperry â equal
rights for all and privileges for none,
and then justice would be paramount.

said the hothouses and conservatories

ing 362 feet long by 100. wide and 60
feet high. The "tempered house" is
the same height and occupies three
fourths tot an acre. The gardens them
selves cover seventy-five acres and the
recreation grounds connected with
them are 240 acres in extent.

Humphries surrendered himself yes
terday afternoon to the United States
Marshal and will be tried for smug
gling the coal.
Jean McCorkle. an expressman,
claimed the team and wagon yester
day. He said he had left the rig at
tho ferry while he was negotiating to
take a load of furniture to Oakland and
when he returned it had disappeared.
On a former occasion his rig was stolen
nnd he got himself into trouble be
cause there was a trunk in the wagon,
which the customs authorities thought
contained, opium.
Captain F. Gray of the ship Inver
ness, lying at the Howard-street wharf,
notified Detectives Conlon and Mc-
Gowu on Thursday night that two
men had driven to the wharf with a
:â¢ am and wagon about 6 o'clock and had
loaded the wagon with about two tons
of coal. They drove away, but he and
bia mate chased them and they jumped
off the wagon and escaped. Captain
Gray took the rig back and unloaded
the coal. The police took charge of the
iÂ«.am and wagon. Captain Gray recog
nized one of the men as James Hum
phries, a longshoreman, who had been
employed unloading the coal from the
vessel, and yesterday morning he
swore out a warrant' before Police
Judge Conlan for Humphries' arrest on
a charge of petty larceny. The Fed
eral authorities will also take action
against Humphries and the other man

The official count was proceeded with
until the Forry-third District w.as com
pleted and an adjournment was >,taken
until 8 p. m., when the count will be
completed, which the law requires shall
be done in three days after the election.
During the discussion Commissioner
Roberts said that, the election officers
had been charged with incompetency
and dereliction of duty and he insisted
that they be heard in their own de
fense. \u25a0\u25a0' When they had been heard It
was ascertained that they had faith
fully performed their duty and given
credit for . the ballots to Mauzy and
Sullivan.
â¢ The real error was committed by the
clerks in. the official count of the. re
turns, they having neglected to muke
the change in the names in tallying
the official count as carried dfc .by. the
Election Commissioners,. Commissioner
Devoto was wroth â¢ over . the affair,
which he designated as a tempest in a
teapot. Devoto took the opposite
ground to Wolfe before the true state
of affairs was discovered. Devoto-held
that the Election Commission could not
go behind the face of the returns and
had no right to examine the ballots
unless a court order was issued.
â¢ As Mauzy and Sullivan were elected
on the face of the returns they will re
ceive their rcre.dentials from the com
mission.
State Senator Wolfe argued for an
hour yesterday before the Election
Commissioners that it was their duty
to declare Byron Mauzy and John J.
Sullivan elected on the Republican
League ticket as. delegates -to the
municipal convention, instead of M.
Tiedemann and Ben Abrahams, who, it
was alleged, had been credited with the
votes meant for the two first named,
owing to the alleged error of the elec
tion officers In three precincts of the
Thirty-eighth Assembly District. The
names of Tiedemann and Abrahams had
been withdrawn from the ballots and
those of 'Mauzy and Sullivan placed
thereon, but it was alleged that- the
names of Tiedemann and Abrahams ap
peared on the tally lists. This claim
proved to be an error, which was shown
after some of the election officers in
the three precincts had been examined.
They testified that the names of Mauzy
and Sullivan had been written on the
tally lists when their names were found
on the ballots and therefore the returns
showed the election of the two candi
dates.
Mauzy nnd Sullivan Declared Delegates
From Thirty-eighth District.

The most important development ln the

gestion.of Jim -Jeffries for referee. He is
known to be on friendly terms with both
boys and would be a just official. His se

confidence to all " interested in . the fight
than any, other act. There would be no
room for any one. to claim that the ref
eree had been approached, as no one
would be. brave enough "to discuss such a
matter with the king of heavy-weights.

The gentle art. of Scottish bowling
has taken a firm hold in this city. The
Park Commissioners in following out
their beneficent policy of encouraging
all healthful outdoor sports and
pastimes have provided a picturesque
green for the devotees of bowling. This
is thronged on Saturdays and holidays,'
when.a|large and an interested gallery
watches, the play. Youth and old age
meet on. an equality in this competi
tion and the rivalry Is of the friendliest j
character. ' .
.When the San '- Francisco Scottish
Bowling . Club was formed some three
'years ago , there were -but few
names on ' the /membership list. The
popularity of the; game soon became
apparent," however, and new >j members
were coming in ;In a short
time a tournament was arranged. -After
many weeks-of j-play Maxwell L. Crowe |
proved the winner. . j
Once or. twice -each year since that
first, event was completed other tourna
ments have been ! held. , Crowe held his
titled one year, when ; he surrendered it,
to :.Y. C. Lawson, , who sin turn -held ,it
a year. v Mr. , Lawson's successor .was
J. C. Moffat,: who won -the "biggest
tournament ever held by the club. The

- The fishing continues excellent on the
Feather River and at the Big Springs.
Grasshoppers are plentiful, so the anglers
are using the March brown fly, which is
an imitation of the 'hopper. -
The fly-fishing, has been, only fair in the
upper Sacramento on account of the
heavy run of salmon going up to spawn.
Those who will use salmon ( roe are as
sured of good catches.

their second trip to Big Meadows this

The trout fishing season shows no signs
of being on the wane, the big streams
still providing the best sport enjoyed in
years. <The fishing fell off for a time on
the Truckee River, as repairs were being
made on the dam at Prosser Creek. These
have been completed and the water is
again running clear. The fishing at Verdi
ard Floristan is reported all right.
Jeff Wells, Del Fountain, and E. Doug
lass are still at Boca. The best flics on
the Truckee are the red spinner, blue bot
tle, blue upright, caddis, cahill and shone.
Paper Mill Creek has been deserted for
the present by the regular fishermen and
ia given over to the campers. Next month
these will have left and the water will be
cooler. The fishermen will then get good
catches.

An attempt was made -last Sunday to
hold the annual contest for the Wallace
trophy, but on account' of the light
breeze, none of the yachts of. the' Cal
ifornia fleet was able to finish within
the time limit of four hours. Thd start
from the Alameda mole "was at 1:40
p. m., but Commodore Vincent's "yawl
lola and the. yawl Gypsle were unable
to beat the flood-tide and get across the
line. J. J.. Sherry's sloop Perhaps was
first across, being followed three min
utes later by George Miller's sloop
Alert. On the beat out to Presidio
shoal buoy the Perhaps gained, a lead,
but when the breeze died out she was
caught by the Alert. Off the ferry
slips the channel breeze sent tho boats
along at a good rate and-the'twocom
pctitors finished, half a minute apart;
but 50 -minutes after .the' time 'limit
had expired. B.McMauus; performed
the duties of the regatta "committee.
Arrangements will be "made, to sail for
the trophy s on another Sunday. ;'

There is considerable speculation among
the park players as to how some of them
wi!J be classed. The first class cup has
been played for but once and is at pres
ent in the possession of Fred Adams, who
won it In June. The second class trophy
was won last by Horace Mann on July
17, 1904. It was won by A. H. Brabant
on May 15. 1904; F. N. Baker. March |
20, 1904, and by N. W. Ambrose, Novem
ber 22, 1903. In the last class-singles
event held in June the second class trophy
was not played for, as the first and sec
ond classes were combined and played for
the first class trophy.
G. M. Guerin has possession of the third
class cup which he won on June 4 of :
this year. M. Long won it July 24, 1904, :
Fred Adams on May 22, 1904, and R. F.
Drolla on March 20, 1904. These players
have all showed enough improvement |
during the past year to warrant their
competing in the first division.
The fourth class cup has been won only
three times. W. L. Howell Is the holder
as the result of his victory In the tourna
ment last June. N. H. Martin won It
November 27 of last year and Harold
Gets July 24 of last year. These three
will probably be seen in the third class In
to-morrow's events. Play will be called
promptly at 9 o'clock and as usual In
these events the preliminary round
matches will consist of best two out of
three sets. The finals of each class will
be three out of five.
The tournament at the California
Club will bÂ« the fifth for the directors'
cups at handicap doubles. W. G. Knowl
tcn and Major Ducat are the holders, but ,
they hare decided not to play together In
this event. Major Ducat will have Blais
dell for a partner, but Knowlton has not
yet decided with whom he will play.
The other teams that have won the cups
once are: George Janes and Herbert
Long, Herbert Schmidt and Harry Rolfe,
and Carl Gardner and Melville Long.
These will probably all be seen In .to
morrow's tourney. ; 'S.
The entries for this event will not close
until 10 a. m. to-morrow, when the draw
ings will be held.
At the request of a number of the
players of the California Club the tour
nament committee has decided to hold a
class singles tournament for all four
classes on the club courts next Sunday,
lintries will close Saturday afternoon and
must be made personally at the club or
by letter. , , . .
Three of the trophies to be contested for
have been won once, the other is new.
Herbert Long holds the first class cup.
The one for the second class players was
not contested for on the occasion of the
last class singles, as there were no entries
received. Moulton Warner is the holder
of the third class cup, while Ed Bacon
won the one for fourth class players.
The tournament committee will be care
ful with the classification of the entries
and it seems likely there will be few
cbangfS made for the coming event.
With all of these turnaments to be con
tested within the next few days some
pood results should be brought about :n
the coast championship events, which are
only two weeks off. There lit etlll some
doubt as to whether any of the Southern
Oaliforr.ia men will be here to compete.
AH the Sutton sisters will be here.
' The followers of the game are anxious
to see Miss May Sutton in action, again
and the result will probably be that the
grand stands at San Rafael will not begin
to accommodate the crowds. May will
defend the single championship title
ajrainst the winner of the ladles tourna
ment and she will also be seen in the
mixed double events. The little Califor
nia girl is the first American to invade
England nnd carry off one of its ttnnis
championships.
\u25a0 On the courts of the Golden Gate Ten
nis Club at the park to-morrow there
will be a class singles tournament for
four classes of players. At the Califor
nia Tennis Club there will be a handi
cap doubles tournament for the directors'
three-time- cups. These two events will
serve to make the day a busy one for the
followers of the pastime.
The affair at the public courts is nat
urally creating the most Interest, as the
entry list will include the names of al
most every member of the club. What
makes it the more interesting is the fact
that the players will be re-classified for
the event. The club will hold a meeting
to-night for this purpose and also to hold
the drawings.
The fleet of* the San Francisco Yacht
Club will cruise up to Petaluma draw

THK FIGHT BY ROUNDS.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 11. â The con
vention this afternoon of t the Brother
hood of Teamsters was the stormiest in
the history, of the union.- Physical vio
lence was , several times narrowly
averted. Nothing was accomplished
and the convention was adjourned until
to-morrow in. order to let the delegates
coal .down. , .The, disorder, -was . the re
sult of a motion made by G. W. Briggs
to indorse the Chicago strike! As soon
as the motion was made.there was an
uproar. Men in all parts of the hall
began shouting and shook their fists at
one apother.. For; a moment it looked
as- though there would be: a clash,. but
President Shea by the vigorous use of
his gavel brought a semblance of order.

Shields Rrsponnible <or Victory ot the
\u25a0 San Francisco Team.
SEATTLE. Aug. 11.â It was all the
fault of Shields to-day that Seattle
vent down to defeat. He was wild in
every move and it proved an easy game
for the Seals. In the five Innings he
pitched he walked eight men and
fumbled a bunt at a critical time. The
visitors got four runs on one hit in
the fifth inning and after that they
were safe, for Whale pitched good ball,
and he was given magnificent support,
especially by Hildebrand. who pulled
down long drives that would have been
good for extra bases.
The deluge and the finish of Shields
came in thr fifth inning, whe-n he I
walked Spencer and Waldron and
fumbled a bunt by Wheeler. With the
bases full and none out, Hildebrand
' FÂ«mt out a line shot that Shields
knocked down with Â»ne hand and re
tired Spencer at the plate. Blanken
p.ship whipped the bill to first for a
[ double play, but Frary dropped It.
AValdron took a long chance and slid
to the plate. Perlne said he was safe,
though it was close. Irwln hit to Russ
Hall, who threw to the plate, but Per-!
lne said Wheeler slid under Blanken-
Fhip. Then Xealon cracked out a
beauty to center and two more runs
' came home. Score:

SARATOGA, N. V., Aug. 11.â There was
considerable more humidity than breeze
at the track to-day. It was simply swel
tering. So far as the programme was
concerned it was an excellent one for
Friday. \ Rustling Silk won the fourth
race after a drive through the stretch
with Arkiirta. The latter came up on the
rail but did not have enough left to beat
Rustling Silk. Adonis was third. Knapp
claimed a foul against Rustling Silk and
Baird also made a -claim against some
horse for interference. Judging from the
decision it was against Arkiirta, for that
colt was disQualifled and Py thia . placed
third. Baird claimed that Knapp struck
him across the back with his whip, and
foukd him at the head of the stretch.
For this Arkiirta was disqualified.
Kuapp was fined $200 and suspended for
one week.
Plunger Joe Yeager came into; limelight
to-day in earnest, and when the smoke
cleared .away he was $40,000 to the good.
In the second race in which three-year
olds and upward ran a mile, he started
his mare Ca'ntten.and backed her from
rive down to two to one, despite the
strong popular support of Lady Ellison.
Canteen won, and Yeager cleaned up at
least $40,001). Following co soon on the
heels of J. J. Ryan's $60,000 coup on Ath

plunge created a sensation in the ring. '

The announcement was made that Jack

was grreeted with hisses. Buddy Ryan
and Jimmy Gardner, who are expected
to put up a sensational fight, when they
meet shortly at Colma. were presented
to the spectators. Eddie Graney. who
refereed the main event, donned his
Tuxedo in honor of the occasion. The
spectators, who half filled the pavilion,
were landed back . in town at half past
eleven. >â¢ - - -'
John L. Sullivan was warmly greeted
when Billy. Jordan- Introduced him as
"thfe only man who remains in the hearts
of the people, John L. Sullivan." In re
sponse to calls for a speech Sullivan said,
"Gentlemen, a speech would be out of
order here, as you have come to see' a
fight. May the best man 'win. I thank
you for your applause; I ask you to give
it to the boys,- and to the winner give
three cheers, three.".'.. ' . \u25a0 ' â¢
There was a bumping match in the
eleventh round, out of which McCormick
came. with a bad cut over his left eye.
After starting McCormick's ear bleeding
in the twelfth, Ruhlin seemed more con
fident and went after his man. The re
maining rounds were much alike, neither
man having strength to land a knockout
blow. When McCormick finally went
down he was not rendered unconscious,
but simply had not the strength to go
any furtner. Ruhlin's victory gives him
no claim on the championship title.
The preliminary. fight was between Gus
Koster and Jim Gorman. Koster was
counted out in the sixth round, much as
McCormick was in the main fight.' Gor
man hits with the open" glove,, which re
duces his effectiveness as a fighter. It
was just a rough fight without any sci
ence. '
BOXERS IX BUMPING MATCH.
The men assumed- an upright- stylW-*<6f~
boxing' and, when they squared off v.in
the first. round Ruhlin showed to . de
cided advantage. He brought McCor
mick to his knees with a right to the
body in the first round and the. spectar.
tors were offering to bet,.the. affair,
would 'not last two rounds. To% their
surprise, McCormick: held his. own and.
in the second round he landed, a stiff,
left to the jaw, "which made Ruhlin's
knees bend. He followed. this up with,
a right to the head and:. rushed Ruhlin
to" the ropes. . ', :>\u25a0',.".
McGormiek- began to do the "more ef
fective 'work in the third found, Ruh*
lih's blows bafdiy having enough* force
to crush an eggsheH.-i
Near^the-.end of the round McCormick
landed a hard right in breaking r out of
a clinch, whl,eh.v cut Ruhlin severely
over the' left eye.' McCormick hooked
hls-left'to the head three times in suc
cession in 'the fourth round and- had
Ruhlin backing; away from him. Mc-
Cormick was .knocked down with two
light blows to. the body, but was up
quickly. He missed a hard right : tb the
Jaw by a fraction of an inch.
A hard left rip to the body in the f}f(h
'round, hurt Ruhlin and>.;a rignt ; to the
same spot 'almost' immediately afterward
added to" lils 'distress. Ruhlin's body in
the region of the heart commenced to
take on" a crimson hue in the sixth round
from the peppering he was "receiving
there." â¢ In the latter part of the round
he was hanging on to avoid punishment.
In the succeeding rounds up to the ninth
McCormick continued his aggressive tac
tics. . In this round he nearly dropped
Ruhlin with a right to the body which
resounded throughout the pavilion. They
tried slugging tactics in the tenth round
and Ruhlin was the first to cry enough.
McCormick a surprise.
Big Gus Ruhlin's splendid vitality
came to his \u25a0 reacue at' an opportune
time last night in his fight with Jim
McCormick . at . Colma. For
eighteen rounds the heavy-weight from
Texas had punched him almost at will.
At this point" it- was a Question as to
which 'was the most fatigued. This
was soon answered by McCormick be
ing sent to the mat twice.. He was able
to get up the first time, but shortly
afterward he went*' down again and
was counted out. "...
r Whether it was i-the presence of the
mighty^ John L. 'Sullivan in McCor
mick's- 'corner, or 'from 'some other
cause,- -Ruhin was - : extremely nervous
when - he 1 entered the ring 'and never
seemed to regain hissef-pdssession en
titrely until the .fight was over.. He
was a Gloomy Gus in the flesh. "\u25a0 '.
: The affair was full of action and des
perate fighting from start to -finish, but
there was an entire absence of class
about it. McCormick seemed the most
unconcerned man in the house, while
Ruhlin's 'face assumed an alarmed look
at the, start;. . which it never lost. Mc-
Cormick ' was ' clumsily clever, get
ting;- away- from many, 'of - Ruhlln's
blows without apparently knpwing how
he did b0... Ruhlin outweighed him fully
thirty ; pounds, ; "and, \u25a0 With < this advantage
and hi 3 knowledge -ot the fighting game
he should have won in short order. Early
in' " each round the Texas; champion
seemed to land an effective blow, which
took all the fight out- of- Gus. McCormick
was getting on famously until the twelfth
round, - wherf : Ruhlin started his cauli
flower ear bleeding. - Ruhlin kept pepper
ing this" soft "spot for, a time, and seeing
that it hurt McCormick seemed to give
him the confidence he lacked up to this
time.... While \u0084 McCormick - .continued to
land the most blows the lack of condition
commenced. to tell on him, and his efforts
grew .gradually .weaker. Ruhlin's \u25a0 body
fairly steamed with perspiration and
showed "alack of training, but the vital
ity was there, which his opponent seemed
to lack. . \u25a0'. \u25a0
They rushed to a mix In the center of the
ring and McCormick went to the floor with

ctoim to be moved the early movement was
irregular and iialting. The corn grangers
f^tmtd notably reluctant to move, in spite of
the stress lam upon :he promise of a bumper
orn crop. Ttie character of the advices
which went out on Wall street last night in
tt.<- shape of letters and telegrams from com
1 lesion houses based en the returns of the
Â«iai:i crop were circulated to excite specula
te activity and theee had their effect in the
trading. Before thÂ» day was ovet the irreg
ular character of the market was repaired to
a large extent and a j airly comparative ad
vance had been achieved by the process of ro
tation irom one point in the market to an
other. High priced investment stocks werÂ«

In this c!a*s exceeded in number and extent

in the mercury cf men. Xot much attention
Â»i- paid to the constant rumors of transfer
cni combination of control which were set
ail at as nominal explanation ior many of
thf-r-e movements. The stocks affected were
varied and so totally disconnected on any pos-
Vlbto grounds of comparison that the rumors
concerned thÂ»-m so far as they sought to asso
ciate them in any way were given little cre
dence. These feverish movements were .still
ruspected to be of manipulative origin. But
the- day of operating in such mercantile secur
ities on any marginal transaction and the
*norrnouÂ» resources required for their actual
taking up in such volume as the transactions
Â©I v-fttrday and to-day represent added to
trY luysiejjr of the movement. Its demonstra
t:L \u25a0 the tenacious hold of owners on these
tjfix.r'' â¢> even at the phenomenal price leveib
maintained wan tak'-n as evidence of strong
confidence In future values. Foreign markets
were watched with attention for any Indica
tion" c,f the r-robable outcome of .the peace
conference at Portsmouth. Thp stock markets
abroad manifested no uneasiness, but the
eharp advanrÂ» In sterling exchange at Paris
waÂ« indicative of a purpose to accumulate fur
ther rewrves there. Discount rates hardened
in London in response and the foreign ex

EASTERX MARKET 3.
CHICAGO, Aug. 11. â Notwithstanding lower
prices at Liverpool, the wheat market here
opened firm, with the September option up
U@%c'at 82V4c to 82*41\ Shorts were active
buyers at the start. Smallnesa of shipments
from Argentina inspired demand. After the
first hour the market, however, eased oft.
Commission houses made quite liberal offer
ings. . News from the Northwest w.as bearish,
the crop being generally reported as in excel
lent condition. For September the lowest point
of the day 'was reached at 81% c. During a
considerable period 'the market was inclined
to drag. Later, however, prices made a quick
recovery on active â¢ buying by shorts. The
cause of the revived demand was alleged con
firmation of "serious damage to the wheat crop
of Russia. According to a New York exporter,
the crop tn forty-two out \of fifty-four prpv-
Inces in Central and Eastern Russia is a com
plete failure. Under the stimulus of this re
port the September option advanced to 83 He.
The market reacted a trifie on profit taking,
but the close was strong, with September at
S2"sic. -
Heat and drought formed the basis of , a
strong corn market. The market closed prac
tically at the highest point of the day. Sep
tember clostd %c up at 54^c. â¢ \u25a0 -.'
Liberal acceptances and .. heavy receipts
caused considerable selling of oats by cash
houses early In the session. . Later the market
became quite firm. September closed un
changed at 26%(fÂ»209ic.
Provisions were strong after a silent de
presÃlon early inMhe'session. The market was
rather easy early, -bat^received support from
packers later. S;r;tember pork closed 15c up,

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
STOCK MARKET.
Trade In fresh fruits waa of comparatively
small volume on regular local account, as the
return of the cool, cloudy weather, deurred
buyers, thus - adding to the dullness which
usually prevails in the market on Friday. The
cannera were still in the market for tcp
quallty lots of Peaches and Pears In bulk, but
they were unable to secure any grÂ«at quan
tity, as most handlers were firm in their views
and were holding out for higher price*. Packed
lots of Plums and Prunes suitable for shipping
were held at firmer rates, while offering* In
open boxes from Sonoma and other districts
wera pressed for gale at irregular prices. Figs
continued to arrive freely and prices had an
other declln-s. Melons were easy, with the'
weather against trade, and there was plenty
of carried-over Nutmeg Melons an'l Canta
loupes at the Inside quotations. Grapes weie
in increased supply and weaker for everything
except the Muscat variety. Seedless from
southern districts brought 85i390c per box.
while Yuba City lots were selling at 65Â®75c,
offerings from thÂ« latter place being mostly
small and sour. . Ordinary Apples were still
in burdensome supply and weak at low and
irregular rates, while strictly fancy Graven
steins in 4-tler packages did better under
decreased receipts. Berries and Citrus goud.i
were In good supply and quiet at about, pre
vious prices.

have been living separately,: and on
June 15 last an action was brought
against the father for the maintenance
and support of the child. The outcome
was the agreement to deposit the
money which will be paid. Both agree
that no legal actions shall obstruct the
issuance of the final decree.
Judge Kerrigan yesterday granted an
interlocutory decree of divorce to
Frances E. M. Dean from Benjamin S.
Dean, and, according to an agreement
signed by both parties, the plaintiff will
receive $7000 that is on deposit in the
Crocker Wool worth Bank for the sup
port of their minor child, Peter S. Dean.
The agreement accompanied the peti
tion for divorce and was entered for
th*> purpose of avoiding the expense of
litigation.
Captain Dan Sewell of engine 31. who
was charged with making incessant
trouble in hl3 company, was transferred
by order of the board. Sewell, it is
alleged, could not agree with Lieuten
ant Kelley of the same engine and the
contention was a disgrace to the de
partment. .
A fine of eleven days' pay was im
posed on Joseph McXamara of engine
3- for drunkenness. He was warned
that severe measures would be used
should be repeat the offense.
J. F. -Campbell and John Farrell of
engine 12 were fined twenty days* pay
for absence from duty without permis
sion. Farrell has been on the force but
fifteen days, but has been reprimanded
several times for drunkenness.
'The case of S. Rainey of engine 16,
charged with absence from his quarters
while required to be on duty, was post
poned one week. Rainey is the son of
the deceased' veteran iireman by that
name and it is understood he feels so
disgraced that be will hand In his
designation.
"But it is our purpose only to show
you the dishonesty of the men in this
department," answered Cannon. "They
have beaten us out of much money.",
"If you can produce a fireman here
that has bunkoed a broker," said Parry.
"I will move the board to award him a
medal. The only recourse left for your
clients Is the courts, and there you will
take your clients instead of before this
persecuted commission."
President Flynn moved that the at
torneys be- denied a hearing; and the
motion was passed. .. Cannon was in
dignant that, as he said, the > board
should nominally give sanction to the
actions of the firemen.
Attorneys W. M. Cannon and W. J.
Hayes, appearing for loan brokers to
collect alleged len'dings, were told yes
terday by the Board of Fire* Commis
sioners that hereafter no cases of
fraudulent firemen would be considered,
and denied the appeal to allow the
lawyers to "show up" some of the al
leged bankrupts.
"I positively . refuse to sit on this
board and consider any more of these
cases," said Commissioner Parry, "for
the brokers have been using this com
mission long: enough for a collecting
agency." â¢

small holders, but also that Joseph F.

she will commit parricide if the defend

Mr. Solomon's lot is unhappy in several

\u25a0Mr. .Rankin told Judge Fritz that never
did dos have a better time than he gave
Al Lean's foxterrier. .And that assertion
was made advisedly, as he was fully
cognizant of the coddling that Mr. Lean
had bestowed on the animal. From the
moment the dog came into his possession
until it was taken from him its tail was
awag with contentment. His business
compelled him to visit places where in
toxicating liquors are retailed, and dur
ing such visits his canine companion was
permitted to partake ' of the choicest
viands upon the free lunch tables. Mr.
Rankin had never intended to steal the
dog. anyway, as it Involuntarily attached

Martin Finn, hodcarrier, was marvel

by the person who had stolen his vest and
shoes when he was both surprised and
pleased to see the missing garment and
footgear worn by a passing stranger, who
fled as soon as he perceived Martin mak

gave chase, soon -overtook, his 'quarry,
prostrated him, . wrenched the vest from
his body and, was proceeding to dlvst him
of shoes, when a policeman arrived and,
on Martin's complaint, took charge of the
captive and booked him for petty larceny
"I don't begrudge the money," she in
formed Police Judge Conlan, "for the sat
isfaction I derived from chucking that
impudent cur through the window was
worth twice eight and a half."
"Tell us about the chucking," his
Honor requested. '
"Well, as my lady friend and I were go
ing from our home, 416 O'Farrell street,
to the theater, the masher was, standing
in front of an express office. at 404 O'Far
rell street, and as we passed him he ut
tered an offensive remark. He had done
the same thing several times before, so I
thought it was about time to stop him."
"And then you chucked him?"
"Yes, sir; I Just turned around, picked
him up and threw him into the window."
"You did what was perfectly right,"
the btnch commended, "and if you could
have chucked him through a sky scraper
skylight instead of a first-floor window
he woud have been properly seryed."
Miss Sanchez looked as if the feat sug
gested would not have been entirely oe
yond her prowess, for she was Amazo
nian in stature and breadth of shoulder,'
while her human missile was described as
puny of physiqueâ as most oglers of wo
men on the public highways are.
"So I don't begrudge the money I paid
for the broken window,',' Miss Sanchez
repeated, "for I'll bet that little snipe
will never speak to me again."
