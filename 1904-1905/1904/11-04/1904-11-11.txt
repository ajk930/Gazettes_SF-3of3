LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10.â The bodies
of Robert McCann and wife were found
in their home two miles. south of Ocean
Park this morning. They had been
dead several days and from, the posi

nouncement yefterday that unless a
euJHcient number of persons were will

icle to enable the surgeons to graft
skin over the burned surface of the
child's body the little one would die.
The response was amazing. For hours
a dozen surgeons worked on the arms
of the people who presented . them
selves. Most of them were men. some
heads of families, some university stu
dents, others mechanics, but there
were more than enough of them to sat
isfy the doctors. Within four hours
three thousand grafts had been ap
plied. The same number will be ap
plied Sunday, when another call will
be issued.

entirely out of water with a big twist
in her hull. The steamer Lightning

defendant, but when tne case was
called for trial yesterday they failed
to appear. Judge bmith issued a cita
tion and the attorneys were brought
into court this mornin-. in the mean
time the court had appointed two
other lawyers to defend Buelna. On
their appearance in court this morning
Wyatt and Zabala refused to defend
Buelna upon the ground that they
wer<Â» not members of the Santa Cruz
County bar and could not be compelled
to defend the prisoner without com
pensation. Thereupon the court fined
them each $50 for contempt. A friend

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 10.â Mrs. An
thony J. Drexel-Biddle and Mrs. W.
Hinckle Smith are at odds, and the
matter is the topic of grossip in the so
cial circles of the city. The cause of
it all is a maid â Florence Dougherty â
vho was in the household of Mr. Bid
<Ile. In time she became indispensable.
A better offer came from Mrs. Smith
and in the latter's household the maid
was not long in attaining a place as
responsible as that which she enjoyed
with the Biddies.
Mrs. Smith had a houseful of puâtp
ten days ago at her Bryn Mawr
country place, when the maid informed
her Mrs. Blddle had made her a fine
offer and she was going back to her.
Among Mr. Biddle's mail the next
morning was a dainty missive from
Mrs. Smith. It is said that the recipient
turned it over to his attorney and then
telephoned to Bryn Mawr that the
writer could address any further corre
spondence in the same vein to the legal
adviser of Mrs. Biddle's husband. Mrs.
Smith avers that she said nothing
more in the letter than an offended
matron had the privilege of saying. *
"It was a mean thing," said Mrs.
Smith to-night, "a lamentable breach
of etiquette, and I have received no end

SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 10. â
Colton is all agog over a forgery al
leged to have been committed by Mrs.
J. Pence. Mr. and Mrs. Nelson, an oc
togenarian couple, owned some prop
erty in Colton on the revenues of
which they lived, and great was their
surprise when they received word
from a Los Angeles money lender to
day that he held a mortgage against
the property. Nelson hurried to
James Waters, the former City Clerk,
and was told by him that a deed had
been made over to his daughter, Mrs.
Pence, on his (Nelson's) authority
and Waters produced documents
which bore the alleged signature of
the grief stricken old man. The in
strument provided that the property
was to go into the possession of Mrs.
Pence with the understanding that
she would take care of her parents as
long as they lived. Upon obtaining
the deed Mrs. Pence gave a mortgage
for $1500 and it was upon the expira
tion of the note given as security that
the discovery of the alleged forgery
was made. Suit was at once brought
to cancel the mortgage. Mrs. Pence
has lately been living at Goldfleld.

Mrs. Ida J. Moody's reasons for De
lleving the mind of Bertha Dolbeer
was unbalanced when she executed her
will were given to the jury yesterday
in the trial of the contest in Judge
Coffey's court. Looking back over In
cidents that aroused no misgivings at
the time, said Mrs. Moody in her de
position, it was now clear to her that
her niece had lost control of her men
tal powers before she left San Francis
co for the European tour that j ended
with the tragic death of the young
heiress while stopping over in New
York on her way home to this city.
Mrs. Moody, who is a sister of Adolph
Schander, the contestant, and whose
sister was Miss Dolbeer's mother, de
clared that the will, which bequeathed
the bulk of the estate of $1,000,000 to
Miss Etta M. Warren, a friend
and companion, was very unjust, for
there were those of kin who needed the
money and should have had It to edu
cate their children properly.
The aunt of the testatrix is one of
the strongest witnesses for the contest
ant. . She disclaims any Interest in the
suit, further than to see justice done.
But she could tell only one Incident
indicating mental unsotmdness on the
part of Miss Dolbeer. That was on
the Sunday before the heiress started
for Europe and the day after she had
executed her will. On this occasion
Miss Dolbeer j had what the deponent
described as a "paroxysm of terror."
* Some parts of Mrs. Moody's deposi
tion could not be read to the jury be
cause of conflict with rules of evidence.
The statement that her daughter, Mrs.
Douglas Sloane Watson, said she (Mrs.
Watson) could break the will easily
if she desired to do so, by telling the
contents of a in which Miss
Warren had written of Miss Dolbeer's
insanity, was not allowed to reach the
ears of the jurors. It is understood
that Mrs. Watson will make denial, if
called to the Stand, of a number of such
statements.
To-day the deposition of Frederick
A. Greenwood, well known in business
and social circles, will be taken. He
was a friend of Miss Dolbeer and will
testify that she never showed any
signs of, a failing mind.
Just before adjournment yesterday
Hiram Johnson enlivened things by de
manding production of tne depositions
which the ' proponents had taken in
New York on October 21 and 22. There
was a covert allusion to "suppression
of depositions." and Johnson complain
ed bitterly of the methods resorted to
by proponents to hamper his side of
the case. McEnerney explained that
the depositions had not yet arrived
from the East, but that a telegram
would be sent asking that they be foT

When the news of the murders reach
ed Fayette a special train was ordered
and more than fifty citizens left for
Montgomery, armed with rifles. All
afternoon and to-night the posse has
been in the mountains, but it seems
impossible to locate the Jacksons.
Jackson reloaded his revolver, drew
another from his pocket, and, brand
ishing both pistols, defied any one to
arrest him. His two brothers joined
him and for half an hour they waJked
the streets, defying the citizens and
the police.
Detective Harrison Ash, who lived
near by and who is known as the
"nerviest man in the State," was tele
phoned to and when he came gallop
ing into sight on horseback the Jack
son boys started on a run for the
mountains, not far away, and escaped.
Jackson, and, placing his hand on his
shoulder, requested him to leave town
or submit to arrest. Jackson, without
replying, drew a pistol and shot at the
Sheriff three times, every bullet tak
ing effect. John Rolf started toward
Jackson with uplifted hands and the
latter turned his firearm upon him and
shot him also.
Just as he stepped from the train
h<? paw Harvey Jackson standing fifty
feet away. The Sheriff walked over to
MONTGOMERY, W. Va.. Nov. 10.â
Sheriff Daniels of Fajrette County and
John Ro-lf, a prominent citizen of this
city, were phot and killed to-day by
Harvey Jackson, brother of W. A.
Jackson, the constable who was killed
yesterday by William Elliott, a police
man. The murders to-day were com
xnitted while Harvey Jackson and two
brothers were seeking to avenge W. A.
Jackson's death. The brothers es
caped, but a posse of 200 men is in pur
euit ar.d a lynching may follow.
The thr^e brothers of Constable
Jackson live in the rural districts of
Fayette County. They heard early
this morning of W. A. Jackson's mur
der and came to Montgomery, swear
ing vengeance upon the Mayor and the
entire police force of the city.
The officials, fearing the Jackson
brothers, went Into- hiding and sent a
telephone mÂ«Fsage to Sheriff Daniels
for assistance. The Sheriff boarded a
train at Fayette and arrived in Mont
gomery at 10 o'clock.

SHOOTS DOWN SHERIFF AND CITIZEN
Julius "Weber was one of Auburn's
oldest Residents. He formerly owned
the Auburn Brewery and was reported
to be worth $40,000. His family stood
well in the community. Miss Weber
was a favorite in church and society
circles. \.f
Sheriff â¢ Keena and District Attorney
Robinson are at work on the case.
What leads to the theory that a mad
man committed the terrible crimes is
that the affair occurred so early in the
evening. If Mr. Weber was burned
there is no one left to tell the tale.. A
son, Adolph. aged 20, was downtown
when the fire broke out. He is In such
a nervous state now that little can be
learned from him. When the fire bell
rang 'he rushed to his home, climbed
into the burning building and had to
be taken away by force.
Some of the neighbors say that when
they first noticed the fire it was in the
lower story and that they saw the two
women on the porch above. This story
is hardly reasonable, however, as the
wounds would indicate that the mur
derer first made sure of his victims
and then set flre to the building to hide
hia crime.
Drs. Todd and Rooney will make au
topsies on the bodies to determine the
exact cause of death.
Coroner Shepard 'immediately took
charge of the three bodies and on mak
ing an examination discovered that
Mrs. Weber had a bullet wound In her
breast. Her clothing was saturated
with blood. The Httle boy. Paul, was
cut in several places on the head. The
cuts averaged about a quarter of an
inch In depth. His little night shirt
was covered with blood. He evidently,
had been stunned and left for dead,
but recovered only to be suffocated by
smoke. â¢ â¢
Miss Weber's body is so badly burned
that no marks are discernible.
AUBURN, Nov. 10.â What appears to
be one of the most atrocious murders
ever committed. In this part of the
State took place here to-night. The
crime is thought by some to have been
the work of a madman. Others hold to
the theory of robbery.
The handsome; home of Julius Weber
was seen to be in flames about 7:30
o'clock this evening, but as the build
ing was out of the. fire limits the fire
companies could not reach It in time to
stay the progress of the fire. Many of
the neighbors rushed to the house and
while they were taking out some of
the furniture George Ruth, noticed a
woman on the floor. Dragging hej- into
the open air, he xecognized her as'- Miss
Bertha Weber. She was dead. Ruth
again entered the burning house and
carried out another body, that of Mrs.
Weber. Going in a. third' time, Paul
Weber, aged 9, rushed into his arms.
The little fellow^ was hurriedly taken
to the open air. v^here he soon expired.

from every county in the State with
the exception of Allegheny, in which
Pittsburg is situated, but from where
a close estimate has been obtained,

ever given a Presidential candidate by
any State in the political history of

PASADENA, Nov. 10.â That great
trouble may result from a slight cleri
cal error was exemplified here this
week, when it was found that the City
Hall, valued at $50,000. and the Villa
street engine house, worth $12,000, had
been sold for a few dollars delinquent
taxes. The discovery was made by
accident by the City Auditor. The mis
take was easily explained. City prop
erty is exempt from taxation. Each
year the clerk reports to the county
the list of property owned by the city.
Two years ago this report was made,
but through a slip the ground upon
which the public buildings stand was
listed by the County Assessor to the
former owners from whom the city
purchased, viz. W. W. rord and Mrs.
G. I. Ward, who of course did not
know about it; Time passed and the
property was advertised and sold. By
chance the City Auditor heard about it
and recognized the lots as those upon
which ths municipal buildings have
been erected. He looked the matter
up, comparing the lots sold with those
upon which the City Hall and engine
house stand, and found that the prop
erty has not belonged to Pasadena for
two years according to law. Steps' are
now being taken to buy the real es
tate and Improvements back. This
may be easily accomplished, of course,
tha city simply paying the delinquent
taxes and then applying for a rebate
of the amount. But had the error been
overlooked for three years more, as
might easily have been the case, then
the mistake could not nave been rec
tified except by the city buying back
its ownership at whatever price the
owner at that time might ask.

All the newspapers of Rome print ap

With the returns from nine counties
missing Folk's plurality for Governor
on the Democratic ticket stands at
34,883. Figures on the remainder of
the Democratic ticket are still missing.
Republican Chairman Neiderhaus con
cedes that Folk has been elected Gov

least doubt that the remainder of the
Democratic ticket has been defeated.
He said:
"The Republicans will have a ma
jority/in the Legislature on joint bal
lot of at least fourteen. This means
the election-* of a Republican United
States Senator. The Republicans have
elected eight Congressmen and the Six

Adams' Election as Governor of Colo

DENVER, . Nov. 10.â The defeat of
Governor James H. Peabody by Alva
Adams, Democrat, is no longer serious
ly disputed by the Republican leaders,
and all the. other candidates on the
Democratic ticket also appear to be
elected. Republicans allege fraud in
the balloting in some Denver precincts
and threaten to contest the State elec
tion. However, as Adams has a plu
rality of 10,500. of which 6700 is in the
State outside the city and county of
Denver, his election seems to be as
sured beyond a question of doubt. Ad
ams ran ahead of all other candidates
on his ticket, and complete returns
may show that some Republican can
didates are elected. Adams' Denver
plurality Is 4838, and he carried his
home county (Pueblo) by 1500.
John F. Shafroth (Democrat) claims
that he has been elected Congressman
at largo, but the returns are so ' in
complete that the result cannot- be
positively stated. Robert W. Bonynge
(Republican) is elected in the First
District, and Herschel M. Hogg (Re
publican) in the Second.
The Democrats will control both
branches of the ' Legislature unless
Denver members-elect are thrown out
on contests.
Republican Chairman Falrley to-day
conceded the defeat of Governor Pea
body.
The Post, which supported Governor
Peabody, says this afternoon:
"The latest returns from all over the
State to-day indicate that Peabody
will come to Denver with a plurality
of between 2000 and 2500. With Adams'
plurality here of between 5000 and 6000
Adams will be made Governor by a
plurality of between 3000 and 4000. The
Democrats have elected John F. Sha
froth Congressman at large and a
majority of the Legislature of 21 on
loint ballot. They claim a majority of
25 in the Senate and of 3 in the lower
house."

Oakland on Amendments.
At 'I headquarters of the Republican
State Central Committee the opinion
prevails that the constitutional amend
ment establishing three District Courts
of Appeals of California was ratified by
the people at Tuesday's election by a
splendid majority. The returns so far
received, and these are from the largest
voting centers of the State, show that
the amendment was supported by a
vote of almost three to one. The dis
tricts Vet to be heard from could not,
it is ) maintained, throw sufficient
strength against the amendment, even
if they voted solid, to overcome the
majority in its favor that has already
been recorded.
The ratification of this amendment
throws the responsibility of organizing
the first courts for the term of two
years upon the shoulders of Governor
Pardee. At the conclusion of this term
the appellate judges will be elected for
twelve year terms by popular vote.
Governor Pardee will not be handicap
ped for lack of aspirants, and it Is
highly probable that the present Su
preme Court Commission and the va
rious Superior Courts of the State will
be called upon to supply jurists to fill
the entire bench, with the possible ex
ception of ex- Judge M. T. Dooling, who
was defeated by William G. Lorigan at
Tuesday's election for the office of As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court
for the unexpired term.
PLACED IN LINE.
When Judge Dooling was nominated
at the Santa Cruz convention it was
announced by his friends that while
they appreciated the fact that nothing
short of a Democratic landslide would
carry him into office, the nomination
would at least put him in line for ap
pointment t<J the Appellate Court. His
friends are' prepared ; to make the
strongest representations In their pow
er on behalf of Judge Dooling when
Governor Pardee takes up the work of
organizing the new tribunal.
Court Commissioners xs*. P. Chipman,
J. A. Cooper, D. H. Smith and R. G.
Harrison are also on record as candi
dates for appointment to the new
court, and although they have not yet
formally announced their desire for ap
pointment to the higher office It is said
among the politicians that Judge
James II. Seawell, who has just been
re-elected to the Superior Bench of
this city; Judge M. C. Sloss, also of the
Superior Court of San Francisco, and
Judge Thomas Lennon of Marln, are
among the aspirants for the Appellate
Court, whose desires for judicial prp
motion are being c6nsldered by the ap
pointing power.
If the contention of the central com
mittee that the amendment has passed
proves correct it is incumbent upon
Governor Pardee to immediately make
his appointments, that the new' court
may take up Its work without delay.
Under the amendment he is empowered
to appoint six men from one party and
three from any other or others.
THREE DEMOCRATS.
It Is hardly probable, however, that
any but the Republican and Demo
cratic parties will be considered in the
formation of the new court, and in
view of the politics of the present ap
pointing power the court will doubtless
be composed of six Republicans and
three Democrats, one of the latter faith
on the bench of each of the three dis
tricts Into which the court will be di
vided.
But the Appellate Court is not the
only object of interest the passing of
the election developed. Though Its ses
sion is yet some weeks away the Leg
islature Is already in an embryonic
state of organization. The question
as to who will be president pro tern, of
the Senate is crusing some discussion.
Thomas Flint Jr., who served in this
office from 1895 to 1903, failed of re
nomination at the late Santa Cruz con
vention, so a veteran of the Senate
must be found to take the place he
filled so long and undoubtedly would
have filled again had he been returned.
C. W. Pendleton of Los Angeles is a
candidate for the office, but the north
erners are pointing- to the fact that
with three candidates for the United
States Senate in the fieldâ Bard, Flint
and Oxnardâ the south will be suffi
ciently under the limelight even if
Pendleton's aspirations should fail of
realization. Frank W. Leavltt of Ala
meda has also let it be known that he
would not object to presiding over the
Senate, but San Francisco will file an
objection to his candidacy on the
ground that Alameda has been too
Â¦trong In her demands In the past.
WOLFE IN THE FIGHT.
"San Francisco should have this of
fice," said a leader of the party yes
terday. "It is almost certain that E.
I. . Wolfe of the Twenty-first District
will receive the support of the entire
San Francisco delegation and in all
probability he will win. He has Just
been returned to the Senate for the
third term, which makes him the
senior Senator from this city, if not
from the State, and this city is going
to fight hard for the office. This makes
Wolfe's chances very bright."
Frank J. Brandon, who has served
the Senate for many terms In the ca
pacity of secretary, will be reappoint
ed, it is said, and Lou Martin will
again fill the position of sergeant-at
arms in the upper House. â¢
The question of the organization of
the Assembly is hedged with more un
certainty even than that of the Senate.
Up to date but two men have been
mentioned as aspirants for Speaker of
the Assembly. These are Philip M.
Walsh of Alameda and A. M. Drew of
Fresno. How close either will come to
realizing his ambition remains to be
seen, as it Is evident that before the
Legislature is ready to go into session
many other candidates for the Speak
ership will enter the fight that as yet
has not. fairly started. It is said that
Clio Uoyd will be reappolnted chief
clerk of the House and that Jack
Stafford will again fill the office of ser
geant-at-arms of that body.
The question as to which of the ten
Republican electors will carry the vote
of California to the national capital
remains unsettled. George H. Pippy,
president of the Union League Club,
would like the honor and he is not
meeting with any particular opposition
from the San Francisco electors, but
Charles M. Hammond of Lake .County
is particularly anxious to place Cali

MEXICAN PRESS COMMENT.
Perhaps the Republican party would havo
won "thin election in any event, but the magni
tude of Its victory le due to the personality o.
President Roosevelt and It is his victory and
not that of his party. Ever since he entered
public life a* a member of the Assembly, eoon
after hÂ»Â« (rraduatlcn from college, ha has had a
picturesque career, and hlÂ« personality has been
an exceedingly attractive one to the people.
More than a year ago I stated that I thought
him the most skillful politician that had occu
pied the White House in my time. Recent
events have not changed my opinion In that
respect. I take my hat off to him.-
This If no time for Democrats to weep and
moan. Those who are Democrata In principle
will continue the fight. Any cne can fight
when ne Is a winner. Let the Democratic par
ty show that It can keep cool when beaten and
eventually turn victory into defeat. To Demo
crats I say: Keep up the organization wÂ« have

UDELL AXD MURPHY PLEASED.
There will be no parsimony in ex
penditures, but there will be a rather
more rigid economy than was prac
ticed by Congress at its last session.
It is net likely that the result of
the election will have any change on
the attitude of the . President toward
either labor or capital. He has": not
modtflfd his views as to the right of
labor to unionize or of the non-union
man to work.
Already much is heard of schemes
Involving great expenditures of money.
Among them may be mentioned a plan
for improvement In the navigation of
the Mississippi River. This plan is
now being outlined and is Bald to be
something on a far more elaborate
â¢cale than that of the old Mississippi
Itiver Commission, which has expended
many millions.
Another is said to be a more elab
orate scheme for Irrigation of arid
land, which will take more money out
of the treasury than Is contemplated
by the plan now in operations
CAPITAL AND LABOR.
The President, it is said, will be
found urging upon Congress a-mod

committed to the system % oi protection,
but he Is not committed to the main

Whit Is to be the effect of this tre
xr.endouB victory on the mind of the
President in his general treatment of
public questions?
Is thiÂ« tremendous victory likely to
disturb his equilibrium and make him
regard it as a mandate to do radical
thing*?
The President has been one of the
first of the party leaders to appreciate
the danger which might come to one
party from having more- than 100 ma
jority in the popular branch of Con
gress. He has led in sounding a warn
ing. The btatement on the results of
the election made by William H- Taft,
fcecretary of War. yesterday Is indi
cative vt the feelings of the President
on this point.
In this statement Taft took occasion
to Bay the danger of such a sweeping
victory was that It might lead to a
relaxing of thÂ» restraint that is more
certain when the danger of a change

made by the Secretary of War after a
Jong conference with the President.

BALTIMORE, Md., Nov. 10.â The of
ficial returns received here up -to a
late hour to-night indicate that the
plurality for the Presidential candi
dates last Tuesday was very close, pos
sibly one hundred on either side. It
is probable that Secretary of State
Tilghman will be called upon to decide
which of the -electors will be entitled
to cast their' votes in Washington.
The board of canvassers in Baltimore
City and in the twenty-three counties
of the State met at noon to-day. In
Baltimore City the votes cast in the
Third Congressional District were
counted, but the totals were not made
public. While Congressman Frank
Wachter was admittedly re-elected the
vote on the Presidential ticket is left
in doubt. From the official returns thus
far received the indications are that
the Republicans have elected seven
and the Democrats one of the electors
of the State. Returns received from
eleven counties of the State give the
Republican electors a plurality of 174-
Until the canvassing boards of the

The housekeeper said that she had
not hoard Miss Warren tell Coroner
Scholer that Miss Dolbeer would "act
on the impulse'of the moment.*'
V.'Did Miss Warren say that the Parts
doctor had warned her that Miss Dol
beer would be apt to commit some rash
act for which she could 'not be held
responsible?"
"She did not," replied the witness
She also told of Miss Warren's ex
amination by Detective Sullivan, but
could not remember the affair clearly.
She thought Miss Warren told how she
saw Miss Dolbeer walk-up and .down
the hall and, finding it oppressively
warm, 'go into the. room. Miss Warren
paid that she then went to an adjoin
ing room and, coming out a minute
later, saw Miss Dolbeer "disappearing
from the window." Mrs. McClurg said
Miss Warren had not told Sullivan
that she had been' apprehensive for
Miss Dolbeer's safety.
The housekeeper also denied that
Miss Warren had told Sullivan that
Miss Dolbeer had Jumped from the
window or that Miss Dolbeer had com
plained of pains in her head. Mrs.
McClurg said that Miss Warren had
not told Coroner Scholer that Miss Dol
beer "had been crazy for twenty-six
years."
"Wns the word 'crazy' used at all?"
the /witness was asked.
"Not at all," she answered.
Replying to a question Mrs. McClurg
said that Miss Warren had told Cor

consulted a Paris physician for neu

McClurg. in her testimony, said she
was in her room on July 9, when a
maid brought word that somebody had
fallen from a window on the ninth
floor. She hurried to Miss Dolbeer*s
room, where she found Miss Warren,
the young woman's companion, and
two maids. The maids were restrain
ing Miss Warren, who was hysterical
and, Mrs. McClurg thought, was "try

McClurg said she sent the maids away
and Undertook herself to soothe Miss
Warren. Mrs. McClurg did not know
who had fallen. One of the maids had
said it was Miss Warren's daughter,

Inseparable from my children," Mrs.

But the old feeling against John Dol

his death the witness never went to
the house, and the first time she set

MUS. WATSON FELT HURT.
I think Mrs. Watson made this statement In
the presence cf MrÂ«. Sherman and myself. She
didn't explain how she could break the will,
nor did I ark questions.
I asked her if she had saved that letter of
Mrs. Warren, but she answered, "No; I was
afraid of my cousin's coming back and seeing
the letter, so I destroyed It."
Mrs. Watson came to my house a few days
after the funeral. She said (It Isn't pleasant
to tell family discussions) but she said. "I
could break that will In five minutes if I was
called to the stand." / Â¦â¢ '
Well, It was rather in an uncomplimentary
way Ut me. My daughter. Mrs. Watson, tele
phoned It to the house first. She said Bertha
had died in New Tork by following- the foot
stops of her mother. Mrs. Sherman was tak
ing the message from ths phone. Mrs. Wat
son said she had received a letter from Miss
Warren saying Miss Dolbeer had been very
ill in Paris and for us not to be surprised at
anything that happened. That Is the way I
got It over the phone.
Mrs. Moody had never seen any
other indications of failing mind. She
knew that Miss Dolbeer was a fre
quent sufferer from severe headaches.
According to Mrs. Moody Miss Dol
beer had only a slight acquaintance
with Adolph Schander, the contestant.
When called upon to express an opin
ion as to Miss Dolbeer's mental con
dition the deponent described her as
"mentally disturbed." The examina
tion continued:
Mrs. Moody, would you state, please, how
you first learned of the death of Miss Dol
beer?
No, I can't say that. Now that I look back
on it. I can see she was always very Indif
ferent to all things In life; not like a
young t>erson who is full of life and anxious
to enjoy It. Ehe was not responsive at all. I
noticed that. ; Â¦ -*~"-

h*r manner, her action*, her words and her
appearance were all altered for the worse
from what yoa had eeen on prior occasions?
Decided!? so.
Miss Dolbeer turned around and gave me
the most pitiful look I ever saw on any one's
face; a haunted look of fear, as If she had
seme great thins; on her mind. She turned
her face and looked at me; then she seemed
to lose herself and went down the steps.
I went in and said to my daughter, "I shall
never forget Bertha's look as she was going
away."
I know now that her mind was not right. I
am perfectly convinced of It. I wan very
much disturbed and nev^r closed my eyes that
n!iht without seeing her before me.
W> talked a little more about her trln. I
offered to live her letters of Introduction to

be nice." Then ehe started to go home and
my daughter and I saw her down to ths front

soSns I said. "When you get to Paris write
and tell us all about the fashions," just for
somethlcs light to say.
Iler look was one of terror, perfect terror,
as if something dreadful had happened. She
was terribly frightened at something, and the

"Oh. my stomach." The look in her eyes waa
dmdfal. She looked terribly frightened and

friendship for Miss Warrea was great enough
to justify leaving the bulk of the estate to her.
Bertha was not that kind of a girl. From all
I know of her, she was always kind, and I
thought she would be more thoughtful of
others. I am not speaking for myself. I am
speaking of others whom X think should have
been remembered In the will. She knew their
circumstances and conditions; she knew .xhat
some of her own relatives were lacking in
worldly goods. It would have been very nice
to have remembered them In her will, so they
could be educated. I refer to my brothers' and
my sister's children.
I think also that she should have remem-
T>ered my daughter. Mrs. Witaon.
YeÂ«, I said In one of our conversations that
Miss Dolbeer might have remembered me In
some way by giving me some of her mother's
things. I wasn't even given a brass pin be

tirely to strangers who never knew her mother
or saw her.
The deposition of Dr. W. N. Thomp
son of New Haven, Conn., was offered
to show that an uncle of John Dolbeer
was confined in an insane asylum.
This evidence is in support of the con
tention that Miss Dolbeer's alleged In
sanity was hereditary. Counsel locked
horns over the introduction of the de
position and Judge Coffey wanted time
to look into the law affecting the ques
tion of admissibility.
An adjournment was then taken to

tal. /
The most serious fire of the day was
that in the upper East Side apartment
house, in which three lives were lost,
several persons were injured and many
thrilling rescues were made. Forty
five families were driven from a big
tenement-bouse on Boston road in the
Bronx and twenty ~prsons, who had
been overcome by the smoke, were res
cued by the firemen.
Ten families were forced to flee from
a Brooklyn apartment-house by an in
cendiary fire which started in the base
ment. Tvro persons were overcome by
the smoke and found unconscious and
rescued by the firemen.
A_n explosion in the basement of a
tenement-house in Williamsburg cre
ated a panic among the tenants and
the burst of flames and smoke which
followed sent them to roofs and fire
escapes in search of safety. Many
were overcome by smoke, but all were
rescued.
Mrs. Faux recites, further, that since
her son's commitment she has visited
him once every month and that he is
neither incompetent nor insane, but
that he is tortured mentally by his in
carceration. Further she says that he
wants to resume his studies in electric

charged unconditionally she asks that
he be paroled and committed to her
care, as she is in a position to look
after him. The petition will be heard

SAN JOSE, Nov. 10.â Believing that
two drinks of hot spiced wine had been
the means of causing her son, Albert
M. Faux, to be sent to the- Agnews
Asylum, Mrs." Susan M. Faux of San
Francisco to-day commenced habeas
corpus proceedings to secure his re
lease. On January 31, 1902, Judge Heb
bard committed him on the petition of
his father. The story told in the com
plaint is a peculiar one.
Mrs. Faux avers that on the night
of January 30, 1902, her son was suf
fering with a. chill and she gave him
two big drinks of hot spiced wine. She
believed the drinks would cure him,
but, . Instead, they made him â¢ intoxi
cated. Her son was a total abstainer,
.ind ehe \now believes the wine drove
him to the verge of delirium tremens.
He had hallucinations that he heard
people on the roof and strange voices,
and that his parents wanted to kill
him. Mrs. Faux alleges that while in
this drunken condition the noises that
he heard were made by brewery work
men in the vicinity, who work very
late at night. Phe further saya his
father mistook her son's drunken ac
tions for indications of insanity
and caused him to be hurried to the
detention hospital and the next day
committed to an insane asylum.
NAP A, Nov. 10. â Charles Cormen, the
young highwayman and robber who
escaped from Sheriff Grace in Sonoma
County, Wednesday afternoon, was
captured this evening by Sheriff (Dun
lap of Xaoa County at Suscol Creek,
four miles below Napa. Sheriff Dun
lap and Constable Allen went to Suscol
this afternoon and were joined there by
Sheriff Grace. After searching all
afternoon Dunlap finally came upon
Cortnen In the creek. Dunlap im
mediately covered Cormen- with a re
volver and the latter, being taken by
surprise, surrendered. He was taken to
Napa Junction and returned to Santa
Rosa by Sheriff Grace to-night.
Cormen is about 17 years old, and,
with a companion named Cameron,
held up the proprietor of a saloon near
Santa Rosa Sunday night. Cameron
exchanged several shots Wednesday
afternoon with Grace and his deputies.
Cormen walked from Santa Rosa to
Suscol in Napa County early this
morning in the hope of hiding in the
hills.

ST. PETERSBURG, rCov. 10.â In of

suggestion that the Russo-Japanese
conflict might be settled by arbitration
finds an unfavorable echo. The senti
ment prevails more strongly than ever
that Russia's prestige must be vin
dicated before the idea of peace can
be entertained- The mere fact that the
suggestion came from Great Britain's
Foreign Secretary does not tend to its
kindly reception here.

Etz mountain owes its strength to the
peculiar topography of the surround
ing country, which prevents a direct
artillery fire. The Japanese advanced
in both instances from behind distant
hills, with the fullest force the ground
would allow, but in the long distances
which they were compelled to traverse
in the face of machine guns their ranks
melted away. Both times the Japanese
broke the wire entanglements in places.
One soldier with a leg torn off was seen
trying to bite the wires.
During the second assault a shell,
soaring over the other hills from Pali
chuang, dropped on Etz Mountain and
demolished a land mine and the mine
controlling station and exploded other
mines. The Russians were holding the
trenches on the boundary of the
mined section. Six or seven hundred
were killed or wounded. The Japanese,
not having reached the place, were un
hurt.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â The an

General r ""Giliespie, , shows , Â¦that, only
seven 12-inch guns out of the total of
100 guns contracted for in 1901 re

these will be made by August of next

The board renews its recommenda
tion of last year, for the immediate
procurement of medium caliber rapid
fire guns for coast defense to the ex
tent of 200 semi-automatic high ve
locity, 6-pound guns on pedestal
mounts, 200 semi-automatic guns of a
caliber large enough to fire shrapnel,
mounted on field carriages and 200

The board' also wants a reserve supply
of ammunition of at least 100 rounds
for the large guns and mortars and

tion the coast defense armament is

Of the suggestion made in Great
Britain that the United States head
a movement for intervention, .the Era
bassador hesitated to repeat what he
has announced so many times, that he
has positive assurance that this Gov
ernment, while at all times ready to
offer its services, has not the slightest
intention to take a step toward media
tion unless iavited by both belligerents.
The Russian Government is fully
aware of the views of this Government
on the subject and it is deemed un
necessary at the Russian embassy here
again to announce that it is confident
this attitude will be strictly adhered
to. ,:-.:.
Emphatically, but with all courtesy,
Russia, through her Embassadors
afcroad, has several times informed
the neutral powers that she would
brcok no mediation at this time In her
war with Japan. It can be announced
that Russia expects that her wishes
will be respected by all the powers to
which she has . communicated her
views. Count Cassini said to-night:
"I have very good reason to announce
that my Government's emphatic op
position to any mediation at this time
will be respected and observed by all
neutral powers."
It is known that Japan Is willing to
entertain an offer of good offices from
the President or King Edward, looking
toward the termination of the war, but
so far no such intimation has come
from Russia, and the slightest sugges
tion of an intention to urge peace upon
Russia has aroused both private and
public resentment on the part of the
Russian officials here. ;"-Â«.:
WASHINGTON. Nov. 10.â Careful in
quiry fails to develop any change with
in the last four weeks in the attitude
of this Government toward the Far
Eastern situation. It was stated sev
eral weeks ago that the President was
only awaiting a suitable opportunity to
do what he could to terminate the pres
ent war. He was restrained at the
time, and is now, by the iron rule of the
State Department that under no cir
cumstances or conditions shall this
Government make a formal offer to
bring the belligerents to peace terms
unless both of them shall signify a will
ingness to avail of his good offices.
That point has not yet been reached
in this war.
No Intervention Unless Both Belliger
ents Request It.

MUKDEN, Nov. 10.â The Japanese
to-day assumed the offensive on the

however, attacked and drove them out

lines of defense.
LONDON, Nov. 11.â The Daily Tele

"Last night the Russians made sev
eral determined attacks upon Lamunt
ing and Sinchinpou, but they were re

"J shc-uld not be surprised to wee the
three powers named, or two of them,
take the action suggested."
Lord Lansdowne's remarks are held
by th(7?e in his confidencf to mean that
whatever the United States may do in
the matter Great Britain will co-oper
ate in, even in the event of France
not participating. It is known, how
ever, that Embapsador Cambon, who
continues his work assiduously to bring
about some arrangement, hopes for
Joint action by the three powers.
In an interview regarding the fore
going:. Baron Hayashi, the Japanese
Minister, said:
There is a definite impression here
that the initiative will come from Pres
ident Roosevelt, though the action
would be joint It is mooted that Lord
Lansdowne spoke so openiy yesterday
evening only because he_had good rea
son to believe that Mr. Roosevelt, if
elected, contemplated making an ef
fort to bring the belligerents to dis
cuss terms of peace.
Foreign Secretary Lansdovrne's plea
for arbitration yesterday evening at the
Guildhall banquet is taken here to be a
pointed suggestion to the United Stale*
and France that the time is approach
ing when the powers must take some
action. It can be definitely stated that
Lord Lansdowne made his speech with
full knowledge that the Japanese would
not resent a proposition looking to
peace from the three powers (the
United States, France and Great
Britain).
Although the suggestion of a pacific
settlement was made unofficially, it
actually had behind it all the weight
of an offer by the Japanese Govern
ment, It was made directly to Russia-
No rower acted as an intermediary.
The proposition was put forward ten
tatively, and unofficially, so that the
Japanese Government would be In a po
sition to deny any report that It was
suing for peace. The failure of these
direct negotiations, however, resulted
in bringing intervention within a
measurable distance.
LONDON. Nov. 10. â Japan, unofficial
ly, has made representations to Russia
looking to peace. This action has re
sulted in failure, and such representa
tions, even privately, axe not likely to
be repeated by Japan.
such proposition came directly from
Japan. Indeed, it is even intimated
that Lord Lansdowne's suggestion may
have been inspired from Tokio.
Russia has announced again and
again that no proposition from an un
interested power would even be an
swered, but that any proposition from
Japan direct, no matter through what
intermediary, would be considered.. A
proposal from Japan to arbitrate the
controversy would appeal strongly to
Emperor Nicholas. He is extremely
proud of being the author of The
Hague conference and in spite of the
difficult position in which Russian mil
itary prestige would be left by a ces
sation of hostilities at this juncture,
those competent to judge actually en
tertain the belief that such an offer
on the part of the Japanese now would
not be in vain.

AN OBJECT LESSON
In a Restaurant.
A physician puts the query: Have
you never noticed In any large restau-
rant at lunch or dinner time the large
number of hearty, vigorous old men
at the tables; men whose ages run
from 60 to 80 years; many of them bald
and all perhaps gray, but none of them
feeble or senile ?. â¢ . â¢ .r
Perhaps the spectacle Is so common
as to have escaped vour observation
or comment, but nevertheless it Is an
object lesson xvhlch means something. â¢
If Vou will notice what these hearty
old fellows are eating you will ob-
serve that they are not munching bran
crackers nor gingerly, picking their way
through a menu card of new fangled
health foods: on the contrary, they
seem to prefer a JUIcv roast of- beef, a
properly turned loin of niutton and
even the deadly broiled lobster is not
altogether ignored.
The point of all this is that a vig-
orous old age depends upon good di-
gestion and plenty of wholesome food
and not upon dieting and an endeavor
to live upon bran crackers.
There is a certain class of food
cranks who seem to believe that meat,
coffee and many other good things are
rank poisons, but these cadaverous,
sickly looking individuals are a walk-
ing condemnation of their own theo-
ries.
The matter in a nutshell is that if
the stomach secretes the natural di-
gestive Juices in sufficient quantity any
wholesome food will be promptly di-
gested; if the stomach doeÂ» not do
bo and certain foods cause distress one
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
after each meal will remove all diffi-
culty, because they supply Just what
every weak stomach lacks, pepsin, hy-
dro chloric acid, diastase and dux.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not
act upon the bowels and in fact are
not strictly a medicine, as they act
almost entirelv upon the food eaten,
digesting it thoroughly and thus giv-
ing the stomach a much needed rest
and an appetite for the next meal.
Of people who travel nine out of ten
use Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, know-
ing them to be perfectly safe to use at
any time and also having found out
by experience that they are if safe-
guard against indigestion In any form,
and eating as they have to, at all
hours and all kinds of food, -the travel-
ing public for years have pinned their
faith to Stuart's Tablets.
All druggists sell them at 50 cents
for full-sized packages and any drug-
gist from Maine to California,- if his
opinion were aeked, .will gay that Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets 1b the most
popular and successful remedy for any
stomach trouble.BERLIN. Nov. 10. â It Is announced
that Err.peror William has decided to
hereafter use the pardoning power lib
erally in cases cf lese majeste. This
is a radical departure from the pre
vious practice. It heretofore had been
practically unknown for the Emperor
to r^rdon a person convicted of this
olIenFe.
It <s new said that he intends to 1
pardon almost without exception when
the offender is shown to belong to the
uneducated classes or to be incapaable
of weighing the consequences of a
h?sty word. Also offenses committed
during drunkenness or while in an ex
cited condition rendering deliberation
impctsible will constitute the basis for
pardon.
The Emperor has directed the Min
istry cf Justice to deal liberally with
all persons convicted of an insult to
his Majesty who petition for pardon
and fhow t>enitence. It is expected
that the new practice will greatly re
duce the number who trill serve out
senreaces for this offense, since thÂ« im
pression is general that many offenders
have been convicted every year
through overofficious State's Attorneys
and Judges.

Convention to-day voted unanimously
to appropriate $1,220,000 for mission

The total appropriation for home
mission work to-day aggregated $125.
0C0. The parts of the country which
were given special, consideration were
the mining districts of Michigan, the
prairie strips of the trans-Mississippi
States and the mining camps of the
Rockies. The longest discusion given
to any one" quetion was that as to the
appropriation for Arizona, some mem
bers doubting the expediency .of con
tinuing: so . large an. appropriation as
$7000 for this Territory because of the
seeming lack of fruitfulness of the
work carried on there. . '

The convention that is coming prom
ises to be the largest and busiest one
in the history of the organization.
Never before in its history have so
many questions affecting: the policy
ar:d life of the federation been brought
up. The question of trade jurisdiction
disputes, so often debated, will again
bs the main issue. Plans will be pro
posed and considered looking: toward
the unification and consolidation of all
the trade organizations of the United
States and even of Europe. Another
question that will cause great discus
sion is the idea of committing labor to
socialism. This question was turned
down last year at the annual conven
tion in Boston, the socialist delegate
not having an opportunity of express
ing his arguments. In view of the in
creasing strength of socialism in the
country a hard fight on the issue is
looked for.
The committee of arrangements is
busy preparing for the entertainment
of the delegates. arranging for
smokers, dances, receptions and ban
quets to the visitors. Mass meetings
will be a feature of the two weeks'
convention, gatherings being planned
for this city, Oakland. Stockton. San

Miss Mead recently made arrange
ments to sell a piece of realty owned
by her in Hannon County, S. D.. and a
search of the title showed that the
land has apparently been sold 'by her
to one Thomas L. Ryburn. and by him
to Mrs. Kate Van Wagenen. These
deeds purported to have been ac
knowledged before Notary Public Tom
R. Evans of Oakland. Search of the
records in the County Clerk's office
fails to show that there ever was such
a notary here. -. .
Charges of forgery Involving the
ownership of a valuable piece of realty
in South Dakota, made by a Miss Mary
Mead of San Diego, are being investi
gated here. The deposition of County
Clerk John P. Cook and Secretary of

ever was a notary public by the name
of Tom R. Evans in this State and

After being in jail two days they tired

to extricate themselves froni their

was set for this afternoon. The Con

was on duty when the men were ar

Charges that they were induced to
desert their regiment in order that the
reward for their capture could be col

and Frank Roberts have been made at
army headquarters at the Presidio in
San Francisco by William Holmes and
Edward Sullivan, who were arrested

of the case is that the accused men
held the soldiers in ,the County Jail for
a week p.nd sent no word to army
headquarters. The soldier? say this
was dor.e to allow the necessary ten
days to expire so they would be desert
ers within the meaning of the law. The
men were arrested on October 3 and
w ere not taken away until October 8.
The protests of the soldiers became
so loud that Jailer Harry Clark threat
ened to liberate them, as there was no
w arrant for thair detention. The Con
stables then asked him to place a
charge of -vagrancy against them, and
he informed them that such a charge
could not be placed against a United
States soldier. During their incarcera

Hoag has returned to this city and
iÂ» now living with his family. Mrs.
Benedict, It is believed, Is in Sacra
mento.
Hoag was the pastor of the Plymouth
Avenue Congregational Church. Tha
woman was his neighbor. It tvas somd
time after thtir disappearance before
it became known that tney had gone
away together. The first intimation
the public had of the matter was when
the action for divorce was begun by
Benedict. Even the failure of the Rev.
Hoag to keep a Sunaay engagement
to fill the pulpit of the Rev. William
Rader in San Francisco aroused no
suspicion that his remaining away was
unavoidable. Then finally the story
transpired and the couple were dis
covered in a town In Texas.
As the result of the escapade with
the Rev. C. W. Hoagr, with whom Mrs.
W. N. Benedict eloped some months
as<?. W. N. Benedict was to-day grant
ed a divorce. The charge was only
cruelty.

resented In the smartly dressed aadience that
filled the quaint drawing-rooms of the Free
man home. Mr. and. Mrs. Freeman have just
finished one of Â»he most artistic residences In
Berkeley and it was fitting that suca music
as- Mr. and Mrs. Gutterson can give us should
brf heard with such environment. .
Mrs. Gutterson ie a pupil of Bauer, and
the master's influence was evident in the
delicate, velvet-fingered rendering of the little
clcster of Chopin number* Etude, C sharp
miner, A flat major. F minor; Polonaise. C
sharp minor;* Ballade. A flat.
Mr. Gutterson' s delightful work with the
â¢cello is familiar to most music lovers in this
vicinity, but we felt that we had not heard
htm at his best until Tuesday nUht.
The violoncello and piano numbers were Bee
thoven's sonata Op. 60 and the Boccoerinl
sonata. t
Miss Williams presided at the tea table,

not feel any prouder than I do to-night as
I accept this token from my fellow clUxens.
I dÂ» not feel any different to-night from what
1 did a. year ago. In faetl I feel smaller now
than I did then and when 1 reach Washing
ton I shall probably feel -mailer yeU I think
that I realize that Important and responsible'
duties lie before me. but It win be my stead
fast purpoÂ«e to "make good.." I trust that
the time will never come when my con
stituents trill have any cause to regret that
they honored me with their support.'
Congressman-elect- Knowland, after
being presented with an artistic invi
tation made of California clay in tab
let form, said In part:
When 1 look about me here to-night , and
observe Â«x> many distinguished Republicans I
feel like the moon'; shining by reflected light.
I am proud of the choice you have mada for
your representative in the Third Congressional
District. Alameda County has a great Indus,
trial future, and 1 will co-operate with Mr.
Knowland In promoting IU welfare a* well
as the welfare of the Third Congressional Dl!Â»
trlct. I have traveled extensively over thÂ«
world, but have never visited any placÂ« that
nature has done ao much for as *he has for
Alameda County. Alameda, Oakland and
Berkeley will In time. I believe, becomt to
thÂ« Pacific Coast what New York and Brook
lyn are to the Atlantic CV)q.Â«t.
Governor Pardee responded to the
sentiment, "California," saying in
part:
It was with the greatest pleasure that I
rame here from the State capital to-night to
participate In the reception to Alameda' s fa
vorite sons â Knowland. Simpson and Hatesâ
and to testify to the Indomitable honesty and
unyielding perseverance of that great man and
the greatest President tm> nation has ever
had. Theodore. Roosevelt. He is the Ideal type
of sterling American manhood, and we leve
him for what he Is. When he was here one
year and a half ago and was about to pars over
the northern boundary of the State he said K
mÂ«: "Governor Pardee. California 1* my Ideal
Â£late and Californlans are my Ideal people."
California showed by hÂ»r action Tuesday that
she considers Roosevelt an ideal man for Presi

Hamrrton and John F. Btahl resigned
last night from ihe Police LVpartraont
rather than face an Investigation tv
forÂ« the Commissioners. The fact of
the resigniitions was published in this
morning^* Call.
Th* men involved have stoutly de
nied their part iu thievery and have
asserted that escapades with women
-while on duty were the causes of their
retirement, but the Police Commisslon
tre to-day made an official statement
covering In brief the true etate of af
fair*.
To thÂ» Commissioners the revelation,*
are. to Quote the exact lanpua^re of
John E. McElroy. president of the

Crd no excuse for the offenses laid at
the door of four men whose reputa

cltltens had been without blemish.
That thesÂ«Â« men should have taken ad

and *worn to protect seemed almost
Incredible. l?ut the evidence which was
placed before the men themselves was
of suca a convincing nature that on*

viow of the circamstanevs the com
missioners hav* decided to make a
thorough investigation ci the cases to
morrow afternoon before they decid*
what court* to taJte uiih the resign*-
CONFRONTED WITH TUK PROOF.
Culmination of several weeks* secret
wntchln* of the suspected men came
Tuesday afternoon and evening. Chief
of Police Hodgkir-s had completed his
labors In that regard and had sum
moned Clark. Ha:aertou. Stahi and

interviewed separately and was shown
precirely what had been' disclosed to

i^sigr.ation. Their action in thus with
drawing simultaneously '.caked out.
With It followed rumors cf misdoing,
but these were doubted, largely be
cause cf the etandir.gr of the men.
At the crisis of the case Stahl re
veived word of the death cf his father
by accident at Portland. Or. Vester
day he departed, civics as his reason
for leaving thÂ« city -the necessity of
taking chsLrj:Â» cf his fathers affairs
at Portland, His friends \rere told
that he did not intend to return to Oak
land, and would send shortly for his
family. Andrews ard Clark have de
cided to so to Tonop&h or sjrae other
mining district In Nevada. Haxnerton
has not said what h? inteads to do.
It was in ths course of an inquiry
ir.to suspicious conduct of one cf
the men that disclosures which have
resulted in the exposure were made to
the head ef th* department.
For some weeks watch had beÂ»n kept
closely upon the sf our. According to
the inf^rtnatioa in the hands of the
Commissioners, the men were not im
plicated together, but had been en
R*yed each on his own account in a

rexoked and that Instead 'certain other named
methods be adopted.
Captain Nance's letter is as follows:
OAKLAND. Nov. 10â Refusing to
yield to the request of the senior class
for a modification of the obnoxious
marching order Issued by him two
weeks ago, Captain J. T. Nance to-day

to him by the seniors, wherein they
suggested the wisdom of amending the
instructions which they had disobeyed.
Sergeant and Three Patrolmen Dishonor Good Records
by Robbing Those They Swore to Protect.
An earnest effort on the part of the seniors

place the senior class In a far more dignified
and secure position than will a sullen, per

will be represented by N. P. Chipman,
T. C. Friedlander .and A. R. Brlggs in
the executive committee to take up the
work of improving the quality and in
creasing the quantity of milling wheat
produced in California. These appoint
ments were made yesterday. These
men, with the others who were ap
pointed as the result of the recent con
ference, in this, city, will Immediately
proceed to work. In addition to those
mentioned above the executive com
mittee includes B. S. Sinshelmer, G. W.

E. Keller and F. M. Wheelan.
Manager , Briggs of the Board of
Trade says the first work to' be under
taken is to raise sufficient money to
proceed with experiments. The sum of
$2000 has been pledged. It will be neces
sary to have $3000. The executive com
mittee will probably Import seed wheat
from abroad. Mr. Briggs' opinion is
that care should be taken in distribut
ing the seed wheat, so that in selecting
the farmers who shall make the needed
experiments the best and most
systematic men may be secured.
An appropriation for carrying on the
work after the first experimental steps
have been taken will be sought ' from
the Legislature. None of the money
will be expended for the . payment of
scientists, for the Department of Agri
culture and the University of California

The Board of Education, at its meet
ing yesterday, received a communica
tion from Principal Bush of the Poly
technic High School in which the lat
ter recommends that the college pre
paratory course in that school be
increased from three to four years.
Acting Superintendent of Schools Ma
curda Joined in the recommendation,
and the board was disposed to adopt a
resolution forthwith providing for a
four-year course, but it was deemed
advisable to postpone formal action
until the next regular meeting.
In making his recommendation. Bush
said the engineering colleges had raised
the standard of their requirements for
admission and that it was impossible
for pupils to prepare themselves prop
erly in a three-year course. Their
powers were being overtaxed at the
present time and they could not ac
complish the work required to gain
the necessary qualifications for admis
sion to the higher colleges. The Poly
technic is the only high school in the
State that has the three-vear course.
Bush also recommended that the me
chanical art course remain at the pres
ent limit of three years.
Thomas F. Dolan was removed from
his position as Janitor of the Lowell
High School and Thomas W. Pierce
was appointed to the vacancy.
Leaves of absence were granted to
Misses Louise McDermott, May Ar
nold and Mary Patterson-

IX HONOR OF OOM PAUL
If. Instead of advocating a return to tha
pernlclouii Indian system of burning, the citi
zens of the State' would work for a stronger
sentiment against fires, use their personal in
fluence In enforcing the laws, and aid ln tha
application of the proposed Stats system of
flre protection, the forests of tha common
wealth would suffer less Injury, and serve
indefinitely as a water reservoir and source
of timber supply. E. A. STERLING.
In connection with active lumbering opera
tions the use of flre in disposing of the tops.
limb? and general debris left after logging
Is strongly recommended, provided that such
burning Is done at the proper time of year
and under careful supervision. Such slash
burning Is now being carried on In repre
sentative regions of the State, under the di
rection of the Bureau of Forestry, and the
results are expected to show the cost and best
method of such a procedure. After the slash
1* burned the ground Is ln the beat possible
condition for forest regeneration, and by rigid
exclusion of flre. after the one clearlng-up
fire, a future forest growth on cut-over lands
Is In most cases r.ssured.
While the use of flre to 'prevent flre Is in
certain cases advisable, as . in the Instances
cited above, to permit or advocate such a sys
tem throughout the State, save in the Â»ya
trmatlc disposal of debris left after lumbering,
would be most unwise. If ground fires are
permitted to run through the forests at/fre
quent intervals, the ultimate result will be a
decrepit, non-regenerating forest, broken by
large areas of worthless chaparral, a condi
tion which the most Intensive forest manage
ment could never fully correct.
That there are times and places when care
ful burning of the unlumbered forest Is advis
able is unquestioned, yet this holds only limited
areas and under peculiarly favorable condi
tions, which are far from general. It may bÂ«
quite the proper practice en small holdings,
where the forest is reserved as a park or' hunt
ing gound, to burn the brush and young
growth. On tracts where forestry is made a
plaything and not put en a strict commercial
basis, by clearing away from clumps of young
growth and the basea of mature trees, and by
exercising the utmost care, the forest floor
may be burned over without serious results. A
more practical use of fire, if conditions Justified
the expense, would be to burn the brush ln
pure chaparral areas, or ln the open forest, in
order to prepare the ground for the reception of
tree seeds. After one auch burning flre should
be rigorously excluded. Along certain roads
and trails and around buildings flre lines can
f ometimeg be I burned to advantage, but the
greatest care and Judgment are always neces
sary. Under the conditions existing through
out the great commercial forests of the State
general firing of the debris and .undergrowth
Is not only unsafe and entirely unnecessary,
but positively harmful.
SHOULD IJURN RUBBISH.
To burn the thickets of worthless brush,
which are largely -the result .of Indian fire*
which killed the timber and opened up the for
tst. is of no advantage, and isÂ« only a tempo
rary relief from the flre danger, as the bruali
Immediately sprouts again. Moreover, If fires
are kept out the forest will eventually reclaim
most of the chaparral areas. If firing cf- the
bruzh and young growth la pernlsted In noth
ing but bru.-h will remain. A dense forest pre
cludes brushy undergrowth, while repeated fires
gradually open up the forest, encourage brush
and kill coniferous reproduction. If California
is to have future foreatx this young tree growth
must be preserved. The accumulation of. duff
and general debris which results from flre ex
emption reaches only a certain depth, the bal
ance being maintained by the natural decay.
In regions where water conservation is an Im
portant function of the forest, the ground fires
work further injury by reducing the water re
taining power of the forest floor and exposing
the noil to leaching and erosion.
Repeated burning eventually leaves the forest
floor entirely bare and gradually reduces the
density cf the mature stand. The result is that
a park effect Is produced, and the future forest
which might be secured by applying forestry
principles in connection with the utilization of
the mature timber Is prevented or long delayed.
The younjr growth which follows when flreÂ» are
excluded is net r.s serious a fire menace as is
supposed, and soon passes beyond the danger
ous rtage. The argument Is advanced that light
fires do not kill young growth. If so light aÂ«
to kill nothing, they fall to accomplish the pur
pose for which they are Intended. If Â«Â»evere
enough to burn the duff and debris, they will
kill the young treen. The fact is that the ma
jority of people do not see a young pine nor
recognize its potential value until it is several
feet high, hence the argument that none are
killed.
YOUXG GROWTH KILLED.
The method which these people advocate is
a return to the custom followed by the In
dians, who ln earlier times burned over the
forest floor periodically to make traveling eas
ier and drive out game. The arguments ad
vanced are that the Indian, by his burning,
left us the forests, and that if they are not
burned over frequently debris and brush accu
mulate to such extent that the accidental nres
which may occur will destroy the entire for
est. The fact is that we have the forests de
spite the Indian fires, and that they would be
finer and denser and less scarred and broken
had these early fires not occurred. The large
areas of brush and the burned out basea of
many of the finest trees throughout the Sier
ras reveal what the Indian fires have done.
Statistics, collected ln Tehama County, show
that there is a direct loss to lumbermen of
over 5 per cent through the burned out butt
loes of mature trees, and this does not take
into account the many trees burned down and
lost entirely. Every ground fire adds to this
dama.e to mature timber and kills the young
growth, so that eventually nothing remains
save brush, which survives through Its ca
pacity to 5?rout from the root.
The Federal Bureau of Forestry during the
last year baa been making a special study of
forest fires ln California, this work belnj part
of the co-operative forest Investigations Inaug
urated by the Stato and B'ederal Government.
Ihe purpose of the fire Investigations is to de
termine the causes of forest fires, the best
methods of preventing and extinguishing them,
and to ascertain the attitude of the people to
ward the forest fire problem. In general, the
sentiment revealed Is one opposed to fire, yet
In certain quarters there exists an unfortunate
attitude favoring a general burning over of the
forest every few years, resulting from a mis
conception as to the best methods of fire pre
vention and of the ultimate aim and object
of forest preservation. This view Is held
mainly by people who urge the preservation of
the lorestg, and not only by those who see the
fcrests from the campers' ! viewpoint a few
weeks each year, but by the so-called prac
tical men who live In or near the forest belt.

est fires gives many* interesting facts

George Eliot makes such effective use
in one of the love scenes of "The Mill
on the Floss." Thus runs the well
known refrain:
"If she be not fair to me
What care I how fair she be?"
If a man tires of a woman, and he is
not bound to her by ties closer than
those of professed friendship, there is
not one chance in a hundred that she
can"\win him back to hla former devo
tion. That chapter of his emotional
experience is over. The book Is put
away upon the shelf, not to be opened
again, except as inspiration for some
bachelor reverie of a future time. Of
course when there is a genuine bond
between a couple, an engagement, or
marriage, the situation Is not so hope- 1

story of the wise wife who neatly won
her husband from his allegiance to a
conscienceless flrt by flirting with him
a little herself.
But in any case there is no use repin

how.
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE.
MR. BRYAN is out with the declaration of his purpose to reor
ganize the Democratic party. To an observer it seems to
need undertaker more than a reorganizer. It is plainly
evident that several hundred thousand voters, who have heretofore
been Democrats, last Tuesday found that the Republican party more
nearly expressed their views than any other and gave it their votes.
Another large element found that the Socialist, Debs, represented
their ideas and voted for him, while still others discovered their
representative in Mr. Watson, the Populist. This left to Judge
Parker those who vote a certain ticket from habit. Just how these
incoherent quantities are to be reorganized in a homogeneous body
for the practical uses of government is not plain.
One thing is plain, however : Messrs. Bryan, Hearst and Watson
propose to get together on strictly socialist lines and start a leveling
propaganda that will attract all of the growing forces of socialism.
Into such a movement Populism exactly fits. They may call it a
Democratic party for the purpose of attracting the men who followed
a party name and voted for Judge Parker, but it will be the fused
snd fiery Radicalism of the country, attractive to long-haired men and
short-haired women, and to all those whose eyes roll while they
dream of an even division of the world's wealth. To this complexion
politics in this country is sure to come at last. The Southern Euro
pean immigration that is pouring into the country is largely social
istic. These imported dreamers are not allowed to subvert govern
ment in their own country and find this an inviting field.
We admit that there is a great temptation to politicians of the
Hearst and Bryan sort to patch up a revolutionary programme that
will enlist these alien* socialists under their banner, and that is what
thej r mean when they talk of reorganizing the Democratic party.

The hundred odd mothers in New York who have been raising
their babies upon a nature system might take some pointers from
this French scientist. In giving the baby his portion of chopped
feed every morning, why not serve it in a trough and encourage the
youngster to forage for it wi^h his nose? A swinging perch at night,
instead of the antiquated trundle bed^ would serve to engender in the
raw food baby a "delicate poise of body -and quickness of intuitive
action.
NEWS reports from New York give detailed account of a recent
meeting there of one hundred and fifty "raw food babies." It
seems that the little ones, who were brought together by
doting mothers to celebrate the birthday of one of their number,
spent the afternoon pleasantly in feats of strength with barbells and
iron weights, and were then regaled upon raw carrots, uncooked
wheat and cider. The affair was an eminent success from the view
point of the fond mammas.
This incident recalls the famous story of the: French savant who
raised stray waifs on a nature system in the secluded wood of his
chateau. The babies were turned loose in a caged aviary, allowed
to feed themslves and scratch themselves at will, and given every
inducement to use their prehensile toes upon the branches of the
trees in the true simian manner of our arboreal ancestors. This was
a great scientific experiment in the induction of a. reversion to type
and the French savant expostulated vigorously, when the authorities
discovered his tribe of wild children and put a stop to the reversal
process. \

WE print a communication on forest preservation from Mr.
Sterling of the Bureau of Forestry upon the subject of the
economic use of fire on the forest floor as a means of pre
venting general and destructive conflagration. The Call has ire
quently referred to this subject and perhaps has been misunderstood.
Referring to the Indian method, we have explained it as heretofore
put before the National Forestry Congress by Joaquin Miller and
others, who were observers of the method pursued by the primitive
tribes.
They never permitted a general forest fire. They applied fire
to the dry spots as they appeared, thus clearing small areas at a
time and making a general fire impossible. We have presented it
conservatively as a means of clearing 'the dangerous duff which,
especially in our dry season, is a menace to the forest. We think
there is no difficulty in reconciling the views of Mr. Sterling with
this conservative use of fire. Surely all agree with him that if fire
can be entirely excluded from the forest one reason for laying bare
the soil of the forest entirely disappears.
But there is another duff problem besides fire. When the
accumulation exceeds a foot, and there are places in the forest where
it is more than three feet, forest reproduction is as completely de
stroyed as it is by fire. The tree seeds, and especially the seeds of
the conifers, fall into the dry duff and fail to germinate. Travelers
in the mountains will see everywhere in the pine forest great areas
where the ground is thickly covered with pine needles and is per
fectly clear of any undergrowth and entirely lacking young conifers.
Yet such areas have not been touched by fire. The seeds have fallen
into a barren matrix and failed to germinate. Now we suppose the
foresters will admit that under such circumstances one prudent and
guarded burning of the forest floor is necessary to the reproduction
of trees.
We desire to most cordially welcome and approve the work done
by Mr. Sterling and his colleagues of the Forestry Bureau in behalf
of the forests of California and to secure protective legislation. We
agree with him that proper burning of all lumber slashings should
be made compulsory and should be effected under expert supervision.
It is not necessary to go further at present in legal provision for the
preservative use of fire. What we want is State legislation that will
supplement the work proposed in the Federal forests of the State
on the national reservations and throw complete police protection
over all of our forests. When this is done the use of approved means
for their protection and reproduction will follow of necessity. We
assure the foresters that there is no set opinion nor inflexible plan
entertained by any one here in opposition to their views or that
will interfere to retard proper legislation.
This State has terribly defaulted in its duty to the forests. We
are without legal regulation entirely. That lack has come to'be a
terrible matter, of course, and the commonwealth stands helpless in
the presence of the most awful destruction of its forests. An acre
of forest ground exposed to erosion and robbed of its power to con
serve moisture in due time means an acre in the valleys robbed of
its fertility and made barren. It means floods so much greater than
an}' we now know that all the resources of engineering and the reve
nues of an empire will fail to control them. Then those two useful
servants of man and economic agents of his welfare, fire and water,
will be changed into elements of his destruction. -^
The issue is too serious to permit the waste of time discussing
what the Indians did or omitted. If there is anything of value in
their primitive foresting it will be adopted in the whole scheme of
preservation, but it must be prbved of value first. Meantime there
is quite enough that is known beyond controversy to furnish material
for legislation, and every citizen of the State should feel charged
with urging the passage of a statute at the coming session.

FIRES AND FOREST GROWTH.
writing was in Â¦' the familiar hand of
the anonymous lady.
He sat down limply on the nearest
Iron bench. There seemed something
awry with the universe. Was it pos
sible that this pretty child had written
such lettersâ a little blonde girl who
blushed furiously and stammered
every time she was spoken to In
class! ;/./.. -V;\v"O^v.
He opened the letter eagerly. Its
superscription gave him that privilege.
He noticed, too, that the girl's name,
written on the fly leaf of the Greek
Syntax, was identical with the writing
on the envelope. He,read on to learn
that he could call on her at the end of
the college year when he passed
through the city on his way homeâ 1
if he still cared to meet her.
The professor went to his room, his
thoughts in chaotic condition.
That night he followed her to the
corner of the veranda, where she sat
gazing abstractedly on the moon-lit
lawn.
"So I have met you," v he said quiet
ly. He sat down beside her and looked
at her intently. "And so â you â are â
the â woman," he added slowly.
She gave a frightened gasp and
looked at him with terror and shame
in her eyes.
"It was â awful of me â I know â It
was a dreadful thing for me to do,"
she turned away from him, and he
could see she was trembling with ner
vousness, s
"It has given me more pleasure than
anything that ever happened In my
whole life," he said simply.
She gave him one quick glance and
hurried Into self -justification.
"I have always been timid," she
said, in an intense whisper, "and I
was so mortified when I would get
nervous and fall in my recitations.
The minute you asked me a question,
every thought seemed to leave my
mind. I got more embarrassed each
day. I got desperate. I determined
you should know I was capable of
having a thought. That wild scheme
of writing you anonymous letters
came, and I â wrote them. I'm so â
ver y â sorry," and the professor heard
the sob in her voice.
He answered earnestly: "I'm glad â
I shall be eternally gladâ if you tell
mÂ« I need never give up those letters.
They have become part of my life."
The girl's eyes grew wide with
emotion. He gazed at her wonderingly,
trying to understand how he had failed
to recognize her before. Now she
seemed some one that had been in
his life forever. He had 'been lonely,
and he remembered that she herself
was an orphan, that after the close of
the term she would take up the bur
den of teaching.
"I â you mean that you want me
to keep on writing to you?" she asked
shyly.
"I mean that I want to teach you
hew to talk to me," he said, smiling.
"1 want to keep with me, forever, the
womanly companionship of my let
ters."
She gasped in astonishment. .
"But I thought you believed i me
stupid â I couldn't recite my Greek
to you decently to save my life."
' The professor ' looked into her
startled eyes and laid his hand on
hers. . ,
"I don't care if you couldn't tell
Greek from Chinese," he said solemn
ly^ deriding the hobby of years.
""But don't you think me a frivol
ous, doll-baby kind of a girl?" she
questioned timidly.
He leaned over and touched her fair
hair with all the reverence of a child
who had never before owned a golden
haired doll. t
"I think you are the sweetest thing
on God's earth," he said, pressing his
lips to her hand.

Â¦ % Â¦ '
THERE was something on the pro
fessor's mind. Every -young
woman in the senior Greek class
realized it He had shown symptoms
of it for three weeks, but this morn
ing it had assumed the form of an
undeniable fact. When the shy girl
of the class got rattled and construed
a present infinitive as a past participle
he did not even notice it.
This same shy little Ruth Payne
had assumed the "I proportions of a
problem to Professor Claxton. The
Â£irl never gave a decent recitation,
yet passed her examinations with the
righest marks. He had tried not to
harbor a suspicion that she resorted
to unfair means on examinations, but
ht could think of nothing else that
v.ould solve the mystery.
The professor's mind, however, was
agitated by a more complicated prob
lem than Ruth Payne's poor recita
tions in Greek. He had, a guilty con-,
science. He felt that each and every
pair of feminine eyes before him were
searchlights turned upon his secret.
He was convinced that each young
woman knew there was a package of
letters in his vest pocket. Of course
letters are commonplace, in a way,
and something any man might inno
cently possess, but these were anony
mous. That was enough to make him
turn crimson, but the knowledge that
he had enjoyed reading these letters
and, moreover, had actually mailed
answers to the address given, hung
over him like a shadow. He knew
there had, at various times In the
world's history, been other anonymous
letters. Really to receive them was
a different matter. Ownership lends
a certain definite Interest.
The professor constantly remem
bered the first of these letters. He
had walked leisurely to the postofflce
after the early supper, unconscious of
impending fate. The college town
"was a small one, and it lent variety
to life to own a postofflce box and go
for one's mail, rather than have it
sent by the college carrier.
On that memorable night he had
taken his letters and looked them over
listlessly until he came to the one
that was the proverbial bombshell in
his experience. He read it over three
times before his astonished faculties
were able to grasp the fact that there
was a woman, an unknown woman,
who professed an admiration for him.
He was not quite sure that it was
exactly respectable to have an un
known woman write him a letter, and
his pedantic soul knew that if it did
not go beyond the bounds of respecta
bility, it at least must be called an
Impropriety. The first letter troubled
his peace of mind for days. It was
witty and bright, and contained just
that delicate soupcon of flattery that
charms the man who believes he
abominates flattery.
Had not she insinuated that she
had met him occasionally and had
been struck with the idea that he pos
sessed a depth of understanding it
would be interesting to fathom.
She further stated she was at that
time leading so quiet and restricted a
life that she was at loss for some
real intellectual interest His mind
immediately pictured the -eister of the
president of the college, who was
spending a quiet winter in the small
village for the sake of her health.
Yet it seemed impossible that a wo
man of so much dignity and reserve
could take such -a step, even for
amusement. .-â '
After pondering over the matter
several days, carefully and methodi
cally, according to his custom, he had
hesitated and been lost. He had an
swered that letter. The address, given
was in a neighboring city, and he had
found himself going to the postoffice

resentative of the Mikado will pay his
respects to President _ Roosevelt and
will then rislt the principal cities on
the Atlantic Coast. Assured of an op
portunity to get a glimpse of their

Japanese gathered In front of the St.
Francis Hotel prior to the hour of de
parture yesterday morningv and when
the distinguished visitor made his ap
pearance at the entrance of the hotel
on his way to his carriage he was given
a noisy ovation that plainly told of
the loyalty of the Japanese residents
of this city. A band was also in at
tendance and hailed the Prince and his
party with tho Japanese national an
them. In acknowledgment of the
attention paid him Prince Fushimi
gracefully raised his shining tile and
bowed to the cheering mass of Ori
entals that surrounded his carriage.
A number of prominent Japanese, in
cluding the local Consul General, were
in attendance and bade the royal party
farewell as It started on its overland
journey. Although the United States
Government has no reason to fear that
any harm will come to Prince Fushimi
during his stay in this country, the
Washington authorities are taking pre
cautions against any possible attack ox
affront. The Government haB assigned
to the party as a safeguard H. I*

Prince Fushimi and his party will
travel East in a private car. They will
go direct to Washington, where they
will be received by President
iloosevelt in a manner befitting
their rank. Two days will be
spent in Washington, and from
there the Prince will go to St. Louis
as a guest of the Exposition Commis
sion. After seeing the exposition the
party will return to Washington and
then visit Philadelphia, New York,
Boston and Chicago. Returning to San

Lucia Gatty has sued for divorce
from Dominigo Gatty, whom she mar
ried in Costa Rica in 1SS7 and who is
the father of her six children. He de
clines to support them in spite of his
profitable business in the Gatty Ma
chine Shop Company at Los Angeles.
She asks for $50 a month alimony for
â¢herself and $75 for the support of the
children.
Other suits for divorce were filed by
Maud E. Till against Arthur W. Till,
cruelty; Charles H. Madden against
Alice Madden, desertion; Harry Spen
cer against Jennie Spencer, desertion;
Harriet Jurgensen against John Jur
gensen, cruelty and Intemperance;
Nancy E. Bond against James W.
Bond, desertion; Delia Dunning
against James Dunning, cruelty. Dun
ning has $1000 on deposit and she got
an order restraining him from draw
ing it.
Divorces were granted by Judge Ker
rigan to Annie McCombe from John
McCombe, desertion; by Judge Gra
ham to Jullletta M. T. Allison from
Herbert S. Allison, neglect; by Judge
Graham for Judge Hunt, to Onesimo
Cevolanl from Augusta Cevolani, de
sertion; to Crauf Grant from Horace
Grant, extreme cruelty; by Judge
Troutt to Gertrude A. Wood from
Clarence Wood, neglect; by Judge Sloss
to Charlotte A. Coleman from Dennis
Coleman, neglect; to Alice A. Lewis
from A. M. Lewis, neglect.
Judge Kerrigan took under submis
sion the application of Charles Leaon
Stewart for an annulment of his mar
riage with Mae Morris. He said he
was forced into the union under threat
of prosecution for a felony and that
they were married under the names of
Steward and Morse not long ago in
Marin County.
Suit for annulment of marriage was
brought by Mae Elizabeth Brown
against John Otis Brown on the ground
of his fraudulent representations. On
May 8, 1902, Brown got an Interlocu
tory decree of divorce from Eliza E.
Brown and on the same day went to
San Rafael, where he married the pres
ent plaintiff, telling her that all that
was necessary to make the marriage
valid was that it should take place in
some county outside of the one where
the dlyorce waa granted. Later when
she upbraided him for his deception,
he compelled her, she says, to live with
him by threatening violence If she
should leave.
To intemperance is ascribed the in
ability of Joseph A. Wadsworth to
provide for hie family. This led to the
breaking up of his home. When drunk
he frequently handled his wife, Clara,
roughly* Because of this cruelty Judge
MuraBky yesterday granted her a di
vorce, $30 a month alimony and the
custody of their six-year-old son.
Wadsworth is the son of Henry Wads
worth of the Realty Syndicate in Oak
land. He was employed as expert ac
countant at the Wells-Fargo Bank,
but lost the position because of drink
ing. He worked for awhile in Los
Angeles, then for the Southern Pacific
at Sacramento, but was obliged to give
up these places. He was represented
in court yesterday by Attorney E. B.
Young and admitted that he had
caught his wife roughly by the wrists
when intoxicated. He said he was un
able to pay more than $10 a month for
the support of his child. F. C. Havens
of the Realty Syndicate testified that
Wadsworth had worked for the com
pany. From Mrs. Wadsworth and her
mother, Mrs. Sarah Atkinson, man
ager of a private sanitarium, it was
learned that Wadsworth drank a
great deal and had twice taken the
cure. Mrs. Wadsworth left him two
years ago and has since lived with her
mother. They were married at Mar
tinez In 1S97. _
According to Attorney Barendt, his
first' move after the six months before
an heir can attack an estate have
elapsed will be to move that the de
cree of divorce be set aside on tha
ground that it was obtained by fraud.
If this succeeds it will restore the Aus
trian to her status as widow, and she
will be entitled to half of the estate,
as Fleisher left no wilL s
When the estate first came into pro
bate the three children of the second
wife offered some opposition, which
promised litigation. However, Mrs.
Fleisher, in a petition for permission
to sell the realty belonging to the ,es
tate, stated that their claims had been
Bettled. This petition was to have been
heard before Judge Kerrigan yester
day,-but it went over until Wednes
day. At that time Mr. Barendt will
oppose it in order to prevent the con
version of the property Into cash until
his contest shall have been heard.
Mr. Barendt's story is interesting and
promise** a novel case. He says that
in 1S73 Fleisher was running a small
hat factory on the present site of the
Fireman's Fund building. He married,
and in 1S75 sent his young wife back
to Austria, presumably for her health.
He sent her many sums of money, but
never enough for her to return. In
1876 he got a divorce here and soon
married again. After the death. of his
Becond wife, leaving him three chil
dren, he married the third time. A
daughter, Cecelia, aged 14, and the
widow are still living.
A few months ago Fleisher died.
Word of his death reached Cracow. The
first Mrs. Fleisher, who is illiterate,
had her relatives write to learn of the
death, and through the correspondence
which followed she learned last month
for the first time that she had been di
vorced.
A storm Is brewing in Cracow, Aus
tria, which: will break over the estate
of the late' Wolf Fleisher when the wo
man there . who says she is his widow
begins her fight for half of the $250,000
fortune left by the pioneer hatter. The
existence of the supposed widow was
formally brought to the attention of
the heirs in San Francisco yesterday
by Attorney Arthur Barendt, who filed
his appearance in her behalf. The per
son most surprised, doubtless, is Mrs.
Esther Fleisher, third wife of de
ceased, who . was recently appointed
administratrix of the estate. The chil
dren of the second wife, now dead, will
also feel an annoyance, both because
of the attack upon their share in the
big estate and the implied question as
to the validity of their mother's mar
riage. These children are Bernard
Fleisher, Mrs. Rose Bush and Mrs.
Miriam Levy.
Barendt's client, according to his no
tice, is Mrs. Rebecca Glueck Fleisher
of Cracow, also known as Mrs. Rlfke
Glueckllch Fleisher. Judge James G.
Magulre, representing Mrs. Esther
Flelsher, says he had heard an intima
tion about the claims of the Austrian
woman, but did not know upon what
her contentions were based.

meeting yesterday afternoon in Utopia
HalL A programme, under the direc
tion of Mrs. A. R. Girard, afforded
genuine pleasure and amusement to the
members and visitors, of whom a large
number were present.
The opening- was thoroughly en
livened by sallies of wit that were ex
changed rapidly among several mem
bers, whose . sense of humor was keen
and correspondingly appreciated by
those who heard- Following this were
musical numbers, excellently given by
well-known singers. Readings, on the
dramatic and comedy order, gave vari
ance and engaged unqualified attention.
The musicians, with one exception,
were accompanied by Mrs. Guy F.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10.â Charles H.
Brooks, formerly proprietor of the
Broadway Van Nuys Hotel of this city
and -wanted by the Federal authorities
on a charge of swindling In connection
with the Brooks Brokerage and Com
mission Company of St. Louis, an al
leged "tfet-rich-'iuick" concern, . failed
to appear when his case was called be
fore United States Commissioner Van
Dyke in this city to-day, and his bond
of $2500 was declared forfeited. Brooks
is believed to have left the city. The
mother of Brooks appeared before the
CommiSHioner when the case was call
ed and stated that she had received an
undated letter from her < son several
weeks ago in an unmarke'd envelope.
She could give no Information as to his
whereabouts.
Brooks' arrest here several months
ago caused a sensation. He had only
recently come from St Louis, but had
purchased one of the leading hotels of
the city and 'appeared to be well off
financially. After Brooks' arrest,
which followed his Indictment for al
leged fraud In Ft. Louis, he gave bonds
for his appearance and resisted extra
dition to Missouri. The United States
District Court decided against him, and
his lawyers took an appeal to the Unit
ed States Supreme Court. This-ap
peal Is still pending and he is under a
bond of $5000 for his appearance there.
Local bankers v are Brooks' bondsmen.
It was , In connection with the dis
closures of the indictment' of United
States Senator Burton of Kansas on
charges of bribery that Brooks' arrest
was brought about

The committee Is elated with the
promptness with which Roosevelt de
cided to visit the fair. It feels that
his attendance will have an excellent
effect. It says that arrangements
will be made for a fitting programme
for that day. For the Sunday follow
ing:, should there be no disappointment
of the committee's prediction that the
President will remain in St. Louis dur
ing that day, arrangements for his.en
tertflJnm*>nt also will be made. " '
The invitation to the President, it is
understood, is comprehensive enough
to Include any other persons whom he
may wish to have with him, and some
of the members of the Cabinet are like
ly to accompany him.
. The committee to which . the Presi
dent to-night gave his promise to visit
the fair consisted of Mayor Wells, Wll
lla?R H. Thompson and Corwin Spen
cer, first vice president of the exposi
tion. Their train was late, so they did
not reach Washington until 6 o'clock.
Through Secretary Loeb an immediate
audience with the President was ar
langed. The committee remained with
him for half an hour and urged his ac
ceptance of the invitation. The Presi
dent cordially thanked the committee
for Its Invitation, and after consulting
his visitors he set Saturday aa the
day. It is expected that.the President
and those who will accompany him
will leave here on Thanksgiving night
and will reach St. Louis early Satur
day morning.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 10.â President
Roosevelt has promised to attend the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition on Sat
urday, November 26. He made this
promise to-night to a committee from
St. Louis Â¦ headed by Mayor Wells,
which came to Washington for the pur
pose of inviting him to visit the fair.
The probability is that the President
will remain in St. Louis until the night
of Sunday, November 27. The Presi
dent has been anxious to go to St.
Louis to see the fair ever since * the
opening. However, the Presidential
campaign compelled him to remain in
the East, and in August he so informed
William Thompson, treasurer of the
exposition.

Alfred Lilienfeld has resigned as
foreman of the Grand Jury. His resig
nation was forwarded to Judge Law
lor last night, together with a request
that he be permitted to explain to-day
in court the reasons for his action.
Some say that Lilienfeld was called
to account by his fel'ow Grand Jury
men for outlining the actions of that
Inquisitorial body for public benefit,
and this the ex-foreman emphatical
ly resents. However, it is vaguely
known that yesterday afternoon, while
Henry Lynch, two members of the
Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors, and other witnesses
paced the trenches in front of the Jury's
fortified position in the City Hall, there
was war and rumors of war in pre
cincts that no citizen could hope to
penetrate.
The Grand Jury had Intended to dis
cuss the Lynch case and the Yorke &
Co. contracts for street work. They
had the, Baldwin Theater complaints
and the Election Commissioners on a
tablet, but as the j hours jsped, Lynch,
wearied of waiting, and - Supervisors
D'Ancona and Brandenstein, watch
dogs of the treasury, supped away in
the fast approaching night. Lynch was
there to- answer that he had not been
a party to an alleged "$10,000 deal" for
the position of city engineer, vice C. E.
Grunsky, resigned, and the Finance
Committeemen were at hand to tell all
they knew about street contracts.
At about 5 o'clock D'Ancona was
summoned, but he had been obliged
to leave the waiting-room. Lynch was
too busy to remain long and promised
to come again.' Other witnesses ex
cused themselves.
When the Jury finally closed its ses
sion T. F. Bonnet was delegated as
spokesman to Inform the press of the
routine transactions of the body. Fore
man Lilienfeld prompted him while he
related that the committee appointed
to look over the figures submitted by
ex- Assessor James Nealon In support
of his complaint that James Phelan's
property had been underestimated in
value by Assessor Washington Dodge
had found the estimates technically
correct. Nealon was exonerated of the
charge that he was inspired, to act
because of pique. The committee found
Nealon's figures accurate, but offered
no comment regarding them.
The Yorke bills were discussed in
formally. The discussion would have
probably assumed more definite form
had time permitted.
The Grand Jury will probably ask to
be dismissed now that Foreman Lilien
feld has determined to sever his con
nections with It.

FOREMAN GRAND
JURY RESIGNS
AQUEDUCT, Nov. 10.â When the
numbers of the horses were posted at
the close of the first race to-day, and
it was seen the judges had ordered up
Niblick's number as the second horse
instead of that of Flyback, which
actually finished second, wagers w'ere
made that the numbers would be
changed and that the correct placing
would make Flyback second to Coy
Maid, with Escutcheon third and Nib
lick fourth. This, In the opinion of
racegoers, was the order of the finish.
The numbers were not changed. Alex
Shields, part owner of both horses, in
formed Andrew Miller, one of the
stewards of the Jockey Club, that the
Judges had made an error. Mr. Miller
hastened up the stairs to the stewards
to tell them of the mistake. Meantime
the red board confirming the official re
sult was hoisted and thus It was held
It was too late to correct the error
even if the Judges were satisfied that
they were wrong.
The only stake of the day was the
Nassau Handicap at seven furlongs.
It was won by Orthodox from Mineola
and War Whoop. Orthodox was an
odds-on favorite and when Martin
made a wide turn with him there were
walls of dismay from thousands who
thought the rider was throwing away
his chance to win. It was seen, how
ever, that Orthodox had the race at
his mercy. War Whoop ran well for
an outsider. Summary:

For Five Innings Not a Brownie Hlta
There is a rift In the sky and an
abundance of sunshine for. the blue
and gold adherents now that the ill
ness and minor injuries which were re
ported earlier in the week have proved
comparatively trivial, and Stanford is
to find itself opposed, accordingly, by
an- aggressive, confident and deter
mined team, backed by a thousand
crackajack rooters.'
The annual smoker rally was held In
Harmon Gymnasium to-night, Stories
of football flavor were told by promi
nent members of the team, and the
coaches also favored the crowd with
reminiscences and advice.
Bis Ben Stroud is in perfect shape.
Force and Heitmuller, the giants who
are looked upon as his chief lieuten
ants, are fit to play the game of their
lives.
The new field is in splendid condition,
smooth, compact and yet resilient
enough to make an Ideal battleground
for the giants of Stanford and Califor
nia who are to measure sinews, brawn
and brains there on Saturday after
noon.
All the minor details which are to in
sure the comfort of the spectators
have been arranged by Manager Ezra
Decoto. The sale of seats is almost un
precedented. The crowd is expected to
be a record breaking assemblage. The
bleachers will seat 16,000 persons and
there will be few, if any, vacant seats
when the whittle is sounded on Satur
day afternoon.
Coach Hopper has worked with skill
and tireless energy to round his men
into championship form.* He was able
to utilize to-day almost all of the men
who are to be In the first eleven. Sned
igar's knee had been treated until it
seemed all right and he practiced to
day without apparent fear of conse
quences. Stern and Howard, who had
the measles last Saturday, showed up
in good trim to-day and went through
practice work without difficulty. Their
substitutes are not likely to get a
chance at their coveted positions.
Boothe is certain to be at quarter, his
form being superb and his spirit some
thing to remind one of Frizell. the Ne
vada fallback, who played such an ag
gressive game last Saturday against
the varsity.
BERKELEY, Nov. 10.â The blue and
gold "huskies" were taken to the new
California field for practice work this
afternoon. The field on the campus
was deserted accordingly, In marked
contrast to the spectacle it has pre
sented each day for weeks, when "co
eds" and rooters In hundreds gathered
each afternoon to watch and to cheer
the work of the California players.
Coach "Jimmle" Lanagan and Cap
tain George Clark also made speeches,
which were received with yelling and
applause. Trainer "Dad" Moulton
closed the speaking of the evening by
saying that if the condition of the men
could be taken as a forecast of Sat
urday's game Stanford would certainly
win.
R. J. McFadden, '05, exhibited a large
baggage check, two feet square, which
i3 fashioned after the small brass
watch fobs worn, and has a large
varsity "S" on one side, with room for
the score of the game below it. On
the other side is engraved the words
"Here's to your victory, Stanford."
The fob will be in charge of McFad
den, who will sit in the rooting section
Saturday.
After the speaking the rooters, carry-
Ing torches of red fire and headed by
the Stanford band in full uniform,
danced the serpentine around the quad,
after whicti the crowd marched to the
baseball field, where a large bonfire
was blazing. After a "hoodoo" effigy
was burned In the fire and yells had
been given to every member of the
team the crowd, with hats off, sang
"Hail! Stanford, Hail!" while the- fire
burned. The rooting at the rally
showed much improvement over the
former meetings held this season and
there is no doubt that the rooting Sat
urday will be the best ever done by
Stanford. Several new yells and stunts
were tried for the first time by the
yell leaders, who are much encouraged
over last night's rooting-
The burning of the Berkeley fence
was the main feature of the rally. One
thousand lusty-lunged students danced
a serpentine around the blazing Cali
fornia trophy singing cardinal songs
and shouting yells of victory and de
fiance. The California fence was taken
from Berkeley in 1899. Built in the
shape of a big C it stood on the Cali
fornia campus as a senior spot of
sanctity, each graduating class carv
ing the names of Its members on It.
After Berkeley took the Stanford ax
Stanford retaliated by silently walking
off with this enormous fence. For five
years pieces, of it have been on ex
hibition in fraternity houses and the
halls. To-night It was burned as the
Stanford hoodoo.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 10.
The final football rally before the big
intercollegiate game on Saturday was
held on the campus to-night. The
meeting was the largest and most en
thusiastic held this season- Five hun
dred rooters, four abreast, marched
from Enclna to the Assembly Hall,
whose galleries were crowded with
loyal Stanford students.
Dr. Jordan, president of the univer
sity, gave his usual address to the
team and rooters. Other faculty men
who spoke on football were Dr. Frank
Angell, chairman of the athletic com
mittee: Professor C. R. Lewers and
Professor E. D. Adams.
The second forfeits have been paid
by owners of twenty-nine sporting
dogs, pointers and setters, on their
nomination to the twenty-second an

The ordinary fan does not witness
such a pretty little batting bee every
day In his life, and, especially after a
team has been playing bad baseball ail
day without being able to get more
than a pop fly or so with men on the
sacks. It was all done so quickly and
so decisively that those present hardly
realized what was coming off.
Waldron opened It up with a drive
against the right field fence that only
netted him a base. Anderson waited
for a walk, and Gochnauer fanned.
Gorton tapped out a gentle one to cen
ter and In came Waldron. Wheeler
had one that went to left and along
came Anderson. Barber bit off a
double sacker and both men arrived,
making it a deadlock. Irwin finished
up the good day's work with a smash
through the infield that netted the win
ning run. Score:

It Is seldom the Seals come through
with a big rally In the eighth spasm
and 'bring home the coin, but they
turned Just such a trick yesterday
afternoon. When they went In to take
their final wallop the score was 5 to
1 against them. After they were
through with Mr. Hogg and Mr.
Shields It was 6 to 5 with them.
Judging from all outward appear
ances the field for the Opening handl- j
cap at Oakland to-morrow will be a j
large and an unwieldy one. Luck will,
no doubt, cut a strong figure in the ul
timate result.
WaJter Jennings, it is figured, will
reserve Dainty for later in the season
and will let Gold Money and Arcade
represert his stable. With this dan-
Serous quantity out of the way. there
are at least twenty eligibles and It
would not be surprising to see at least
Blxteen lined up when Starter Dick
Dwyer springs the barrier. Fossil. Gold
Money, Leila. Captain Forsee. G. W.

Prominent among the Eastern arriv
als on last evening's Overland was E.
<..". Hopper, who comes here direct from
Latonia. Mr. Hopper will again fill the
position cf presiding judge at Oakland
and Ingleside. His fair and impartial
decisions have earned for him the re
spect and admiration of all classes of
racegoers. No more popular official
ever visited this coast.
Associate Judge Pettengill will not
reach here until after the close of the
Aqueduct meeting at New York.
Bob Smith and wife arrived here
Wednesday night from Kansas City.
Mrs. Smith has been an invalid the
Src-ater portion of the past summer and
Bob hopes that the California climate
will wcrk beneficial results in her con
dition. One day during the Chicago
fame a Windy City paper issued an
txtra stating that he "killed" the ring
for $250,000. Bob says he tried to get a
package of that brand, but couldn't
find ihf washhouse.
Louis EzpII's string of eight got in
at Oakland from Kansas City Wednes
day. Louis thinks his boy Anderson
the equal of any lightweight rider In
the country, barring possibly two or
three.
Ed Corrigran's crack horse McGee
broke down at Kansas City and was
removed from the track in an ambu
lance. The English bred fellow stood
Icr a world of drilling.
Charley Patterson. Clem Pierce and
Jockey Rosco*- Coleman are fresh ar
rivals from New York. Charley had
the crack Burns & Waterhouse colt
Humo fired and thinks he may cut
quite a figure as a three-year-old.
Helgesen. one of the best of the Chi
cago riders, is here and will have a
mount on one of the Jennings horses
in the handicap to-morrow.
Among the sixteen or more firms
which will chalk up the prices at Oak
land to-morrow will be the follow
ing: George Rose, Joe Harlan. Mel
bourne Club, Hoffman Bros., Marcus
Cartwright, Billy Engstrom, Donald
Mitchell. Henry FHttner, Brooklyn

In a car which pulled into Oakland
mole from Chicago last evening came
Harry Froelich. who has given Califor
nia the overlook for four years; Mique
McSherry, the popular Pinkerton offi
cial; Bill Henry, the handsome broth

Boothe will do well at quarter for the blue and gold, although he
should be compelled to call for faster play. Lasater is a much more con
sistent ground-gainer through the line than Weller. Snedigar, Meade and
Kern are all as good as or better than Dole and infinitely superior to Chal
mers. Sprott should be able to handle Force. Smith and Clark on the
cardinal ends double discount the men opposite them. Heitmuller. has every
right to toy with Shields and Stroud is greatly the superior of Hyde.
Thompson and Roosevelt are excellent guards defensively and will be
able to stop many bucks.
Several men in the cardinal line do not perform their duties on the
offensive, seeming to think their work is done when their man is put out
of play. California will probably be faster than her opponents and her
tackling Is surer. Stanford has a better Interference in general. Heitmul
ler Is able to outpunt any of the cardinal kickers.
The press agents of both teams have been sending out wild tales about
crippled men and such talk is mostly buncombe- Stanford's team is in
fine condition and the California eleven is no more stale than the new
student that tries to be humorous with "prexy." The betting favors Stan
ford and on theory the cardinal should win by a small margin, but foot
ball is a peculiar game and all sorts of accidents may happen. California
Is superior offensively and has practically an even chance when It comes
to actual scoring. A wet day will make the game a toss up.
Incidentally it may be noted that the blue and gold outfit has somei
new formations and wily tricks that may bring sadness to the lada from
Palo Alto.
On the form shown during the preliminary games the Stanford football
team should be strongrer defensively in to-morrow's great contest than
the California eleven. The cardinal line has had plenty of experience, and,
according to theory, should give a splendid account of Itself. At quarter
Stanford is again stronger than her rival. Dole should be good for light
gains at almost any stage of the game. Weller showed up well last year,
but his playing this season has not been as consistent a^ his fellow stu
denta might wish. If the cardinal strikes a winning streJk Chalmers will
also make ground, but when things look dark he seems to lack aggres
sivenes?.

THE SAN FRANCISCO ' CALL/FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11. 1904.
Manager James Coffroth of tho
Yosemite Club is making an effort to
match Jimmy Britt and Jimmy Gard
ner for a twenty-round contest in this
city for the December date of the
club. Gardner has challenged Britt
and wants to fight in the worst way.
Britt says he will not meet the Low
ell man unless he makes 133 pounds
ringside.
Gardner is not a lightweight boxer
and many of the wise ones say ho
cannot even make 135 pounds. He
says he can make that weight handily
and an effort will be made to have
Britt give his consent to a match with
Gardner at 135 pounds ringside or at
6 o'clock. If this match fails to go
through the managers of the Yosem
ite Club are figuring on bringing Britt
and Corbett together provided the
latter beats Battling Nelson.
Billy Roche has been appointed ref
eree of the Corbett-Nelson bout-
Roche says the men have each posted
a Â»500 forfeit that neither shall leave
his training quarters within three
weeks of the battle. This has proba
bly been done to keep Corbett at hard
work and prevent him from stepping
off the narrow path while training.
Yosemitc Club Officials Are Making
an Effort to Bring the Rival
Boxers Together.
Many of the members of the San
Francisco Golf Club continue to use
the course on the Presidio reservation
for practice. It is said that some of
them are disposed, despite the harsh
treatment received from the military
authorities, to have the club remain
in its present location. Instead of go
ing out to the new grounds near In
gleside. Several members availed
themselves of the beautiful weather
on election day to make some practice
rounds of the Presidio course.
It is expected that the contest for
the women's championship of the Pa
cific Coast Golf Association, which
was to have been held on the Presidio
course April 12 to 15 but was post
poned till the August meet at Del
Monte, will take place at the end of
the present month, either on the Pre
sidio course or on the new links of
the Claremont Country Club.
The grounds and clubhouse of the
Claremont Country Club, in the mem
bership of .which are included the
members of the old Oakland Golf
Club, will be formally opened about
the end of this month. The opening
events will include a lawn tennis tour
nament, golf competitions, Scotch
bowling and other sports.

The plaintiff in the second suit is
'Frank J. Hellen. manager of the Tus
can Springs. He asks $10,000 dam
ages for a libel published In the Ex
aminer on October 8, wherein it, was
stated that the defendant had com
mitted frauds in his management of
the property.
Two suits were filed in the United
States court yesterday against E. B.
Wallbridge to recover an aggregate
of 521,000 damages for alleged libel
and fraud. The plaintiff in the first
case is th"e Tuscan Mineral Springs
Company. It is charged that on July
20, 1903, the defendant, intending to
defraud, falsely represented to the
plaintiff that the springs were of great
value and contained health restoring
properties and that the profits of the
business had amounted to $14,000 for
the twelve months immediately pre
ceding that date. It is alleged that
there was no profit in the business;
that springs Nos. 6, 8 and 15 were
dry and gave no water whatever, and
that the defendant, in order to. de
fraud the plaintiff, had the springs ar
tificially filled with ordinary drinking
water devoid of any mineral proper
ties whatsoever.
It is charged further that, relying
upon the fraudulent representations
of the defendant, the plaintiff expend
ed $11,000 upon rents and improve
ments. The plaintiff wants that sum
returned.

A O. McADIE. District Forecaster.
Sidney Rimmer, 12 years old, and {
Norman Railton, two years his Junior, j
are, according to the police, among the !
worst burglars that have infested the j
Mission district. They have been in ;
trouble almost since they learned to J
walk and have' spent several terms Â¦,
with the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society.
They are now under arrest on, two
charges of burglary to which they hava
confessed.
They entered the residence of Mrs.
Charles Evers, 309 Shotwell street, last
Saturday afternoon and stole two gold I
watches and a stick pin. They climbed !
to the roof by means of a ladder and j
forced open a door into the attic. Then !
they broke a hole In the ceiling with
axes and dropped through it to the
bedroom below, where they found the
articles. Mrs. Evers was absent at the
time. i
They also broke into the saloon of|
J. O'Reilly, 1401 Valencia street, on
Tuesday afternoon. while the place was
closed during the polling hours. En
trance had been effected by breaking
the glass in the rear door and pushing
back the bolt. They broke open the
cash register and stole $24 45. Frank
Lynch and Richard Windrow, who had
been arrested on suspicion by Police
man Kelleher, were released from cus
tody yesterday morning after the con
fession of the boys.
With the money taken from C^Reil
ly's cash register Rimmer and Railton
went to San Mateo. accompanied by"
another boy, Howard Holbrook. where
each purchased a revolver and am
munition, intending to start out as
footpads. Constable Sheehan saw them
and took them in charge. ! He notified
the police and Detectives Graham and
Fitzgerald went to 8an Mateo on Wed- Â¦
nesday night and brought them back. !
When searched they had $17 65 of the
money taken from O'Reilly's cash
register still in their possession and one
of the gold watches stolen from Mrs.
Evers' residence. The trio will be
taken before the Juvenile Court this j
afternoon. . . : *.i
The trial will be resumed Monday
morning. Mrs. Tabor Is represented
by Attorney A. B. Treadwell.
A jury in Judge Graham's depart
ment yesterday heard the beginning
of the case of Octavia Tabor against
Charles H. Rogers and George W. and
Teresa Shriner for $30,000 damages for
false imprisonment. The plaintiff was
on the stand most of the day. Officer
White, who made the arrest, and Offi
cer Flynn, who escorted her back from
the station, told their stories briefly.
The Shriners conduct the Hotel Re
sina. Rogers is Mrs. Shriner's brother
and was engaged to marry Mrs. Tabor.
On the night of January 31 last he is
said to have accused his - fiancee of
stealing his watch and a diamond pin.
He had her taken to' the City Hall sta
tion.
Mrs. Tabor said she had never been
charged with wrongdoing before. Her
evidence was interesting. She studied
vocal music for nine years, one of her
teachers being Ugo Talbo, and she
intended to teach for a living, but the
incident upon which the suit is based
interfered with her plans, and now she
is doing typewriting. Under the cross
examination of Judge Maguire, repre
senting the defense, it was brought out
that Mrs. Tabor is the divorced wife
of Samuel Tabor, a traveling man.
Last year, when she was living in the
Mercantile Library | building an officer
searched her rooms for evidence of the
person or effects of a San Francisco
attorney, at the instance of the lat
ter's wife, but found nothing.
The plaintiff said she was introduced
to Rogers at the Regina. They be
came friendly at a later meeting at the
home of a Miss Williams, and next
day she visited. him at his home on
Shotwell street. At the invitation of
himself and his housekeeper she re
mained all night and shortly after they
were engaged.
On the unfortunate day In January
she went to San Mateo wth a
friend and returned to the Re
gina in the evening. The Shrin
ers and Rogerses, she says, were
playing cards, and after the game
they had two drinks of Tom and Jerry.
At this time a man named Brodie jok
ingly took the watch from Rogers'
pocket and Rogers expressed surprise
that he "could have been fooled." La
ter Rogers and Mrs. Tabor went out
for oysters. When they returned she
asked him what time it was. The
watch was gone and, according to the
witness, he grabbed her by the arm,
dragged her upstairs to the room of
the Shriners and declared that she had
stolen his watch and also a diamond
pin which he had lost at the beach a
week before, j Her protestations of in
nocence were In vain and an officer
was sent for, who took her to Jail.
There Rogers said he had decided not
to prosecute the case.
She said ' that Rogers wanted to
patch the thing up, but she decided to
leave the hotel, whereupon he offered
to pay the 515 roam rent which would
have been due, but she declined to ac
cept it.
Pacific wharf was crowded yesterday
afternoon when the Oceanic liner Sierra
straightened out for a run to the An
tipodes. Every one on her large pas
senper list stood on deck and called
good-bys across the steamship's rail?
to the friends left behind. Even as the
big vessel went down the bay the white
bits cf handkerchiefs fluttered the last
farewells between Fhip and chore.
Among the passengers was Sol Sheri
dan, the well known newspaper man
and war correspondent, who goes to
Honolulu, where he will take an edi
torial position on the Advertiser, 7 : a
journal published in that city. The
list also includes Captain Henry W.

tent sisters, Mary. Ann McCann and
Eliza J. Stoddard, \ was made yester
day by the; filing -of a suit to compel
the reconveyance by Mrs. Stoddard to
Mrs. McCann of a" half interest in the

by their brother, David Fitzgibbon.
The plaintiff in the action is the Cen
tral Trust / Company," as guardian for
Mrs. McCann, and the defendants are
Stoddard,; her guardian; Isabella
Af fleet, and Joseph M. Toner. It is al
leged that- on November * 16 last, by

Kiniry received his wound last night
while attempting to enter the house of
E. L. Doheny, a wealthy citizen of
Chester place. He was detected enter
ing a window of the house by Special
Officer Hendrickson and attempted to
make his escape. The officer opened
fire, wounding Kiniry slightly. He,
however, succeeded in getting away in
the darkness. To-day he was found at
the residence of C. P. Barnes, where ha
had been rooming for four months past
under the name of Fred West. He Is
only about 22 years old.
The crime for which Kiniry Is wanted
was one of the most sensational in the
police annals of the State. After a long
series of burglaries in Oakland, during
the fall of 1903, Klnlry, together with a
pal, Frank Goldstein, was detected on
the night of November 27 attempting
to enter a private house there. A pistol
duel between the officer and the burg
lars ensued, In which the officer shot
and killed Goldstein, and was pursuing
and firing at Kiniry when the latter
turned and shot the officer dead. He
succeeding in making his escape from
the city, and while .a search for him
has been kept up from the date of the
crime, no trace of him has been found
until to-day.
The authorities have not decided
what to do with the prisoner. If the
Oakland police have a case against
him they will be permitted to take
him there for trial. He can be con
victed here of eight burglaries and of
the murderous assault upon the of
ficer last night.
In the presence of half a dozen de
tectives to-night Fred West, alias Kin
iry, confessed that he was one of the
men who, on November 27 last year,
engaged In the running fight which re
sulted in the murder of Policeman
James H. Smith of Oakland. The pris
oner denies, however, that he fired the
shot which killed the officer. He de
clares that that shot was fired by Gold
stein, the other burglar, who was killed
in the fight.
"I begged Goldstein to quit the bur
glary-business," said Kiniry to-night.
"I told' him his duty was to his mother
and sister, but he declared he found it
easier than working. On the night of
the killing we had been through two
houses and when that policeman tried
to arrest us we had the stuff on us.
We ran and the policeman ran after
us. Goldstein stopped and said he
'was going to kill the bull' and began
shooting at the officer. I kept on and
did not fire a shot. Goldstein called to
me that he had been shot and wanted
me to help him. By that time the po
liceman was out of business, for Gold
stein had fixed him. I took Goldstein
to some Chinese, but they would not
bind his wounds. Then we went to the
place where they later found his body.
He died in my arms there and I left
him. I took part of the stuff he had
with him and went, downtown. The
next day I went to San Francisco. Yes,
I admit I was there, but no man can
prove that I fired a shot at that officer.
"I committed the big jewelry rob
bery in San Francisco unassisted. It
was easy. I passed a policeman on
the corner, got into the house
through a window and got the jewel
ry. I knew there was other good
picking in that house, but I could not
get into one of the rooms and had to
leave sooner than I wanted to. I aiso
committed that Potter job in Chicago.
I worked there for months and got
away with nearly $10,000 worth of
stuff, but I lost most of it. I have
been working in Los Angele3 for
months and have robbed twenty-three
houses here."
Kiniry became visibly excited when
accused of being the fugitive murderer.
A detailed description of Kiniry, sent
out from Oakland at the time of the
murder, was then Becured and com
pared with the prisoner. It was found
to fit him exactly in every detail. In
face of all the proof the prisoner stead
fastly maintained he was not Kiniry.
Later he was removed from the oper
ating table to a room in the hospital
and a strong watch placed over him.
He is known as a desperate character
and every precaution will be taken to
prevent his escape from the hospital
until he can be removed to Jail.' His
injuries are not serious.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10.â A sensa
tion was unearthed at the Los Angeles
police headquarters to-day when Fred
West, who was wounded last night by
Special Policeman J. S. Hendiickson
while he was attempting to rob the
residance of E. L. Doheny In Chester
place, was identified on the operating
table at the / Emergency Hospital as
P. David Kiniry (or Kanary), wanted In
Oakland for the murder of Policeman
James H. Smith on November 27, 1903,
and for the arrest of whom a reward
of $1250 is offered. The identification
of Kiniry was made by Detective Paul
Flammer of the city â¢ detective force,
who, in examining the mouth of the
prisoner, discovered a false porcelain
tooth, which corresponded with the
printed description of the murderer of
Smith.

CHICAGO. Nov. 10. â The wheat market was
comparatively steady at the opening, the effect
of rain or tnew In many parts of the South
west being offset by a much smaller movement
in the Northwest and by higher prices In for
eign grain markets. Initial quotations on De
cember were unchanged at $1 13%. May was
unchanged to *i><: lower at $1 12*4Â©1 12%. For
a time the market was rather quiet, there be
ing a small demand from pit traders and fair
buying by commission houses. There was
some sÂ«ntnÂ«r on reports of a break in the
drouth In the Southwest, but strength of corn
restricted offerings. Toward thÂ» middle of the
session the market became strong in sympathy
with bulliÂ«h conditions In the Northwest. At
Minneapolis an excellent cash demand was re
ported and a considerable improvement in
milling demand was noted. In the Southwest
also the demand from millers was urgent. The
high oolnt In December was reached at
$1 14%. May sold up to $1 13K- During the
last hour of trading the market lost much of
its frtrength as a result of selling, due to a
break In corn prices. Tho close, however, was
firm, final quotations on December being 840
>,^c up to $1 1STÂ«- May closed at $1 13%.
Active covering by shorts caused a strong
tone in the corn market early in the day. The
market closed weak at about the lowest point
of the day. December was %c down at BOTgC.
Oats were influenced entirely by the action
of other grains. December closed %@Uc lower
at 2S%Â®2STÂ»c
Lower Dricea of hogs and a slump In corn
had a depressing influence on the provision
market. At tho close January pork was down

It was quite an interesting day on the Stock

freely dealt in and quotations had an advanc
ing tendency, Hawaiian Commercial advancing

Business Better, With a More Inter
esting Market.
Trade in Apples wasi of fair volume, but the
market was overstocked with fincy fruit and
some handlers of imported srtock were willing
to sail at cost in order to effect clearances.
Extra lancy Oregon Spitzenbergs were ttrmly
held at previous prices, but found few buyers.
Common California Apples were neglected, ow
ing to the abundance and reasonable prices of
fancy fruit from other States. Stock* of other
orchard fruits were generally light and prices
of all descriptions were well maintained. Grapes
continued to advance under jteadily decreasing
receipts and stocks were closely cleaned up at
the close. Strawberries did better under light
receipts, while the other Berries ftood as pre
viously quoted. New crop Oranges were 'n
free supply.- and although trade was fairly
active, prices ranged lower, $3 being regarded
as an extreme figure for the beat matured
stock. Grape Fruit, too. was lower under in
creased supplies, while the other Citrus fruits
were firm at unchangeJ rates.

STOCK MARKET.
Changes in quotations yesterday were few
and slight. Butter continued weak as a rule,
though some houses reported a steadier tone
for strictly fancy creamery. Others were over
loaded and reported exactly the reverse. Store
Butter was offered low down. There was no
change in Cheese.
The situation in Eggs was very similar to
that in Butter. Some houses were cleaned up
of ranch goods and quoted a very firm market,
while others stated that, not being sold out
and finding the market beginning to drag, they
were offerlrg to sell at concessions to clear
their floors. -The general situation, however,
stood about the same.
Receipts were 6.\400 lbs Butter, 523 casea

No more Western Poultry came in and there
was very little of the stock previously received
left on hand. Trad^ was more active in do
mestic stock, which was in light receipt, but
prices were without quotable change. Dressed
Turkeys were offering in small quantities and
sold at 22tf?2l>c per pound. ,
Trade in Game was rather quiet and prices
showed considerable revision. Sprig and
Widgeon Ducks were quoted firmer, while Red
Heads. Gray Geese and Hare were mostly in
poor condition ancl cheaper.

Previous conditions prevailed In the Potato
market and low prices still ruled, with fe

the demand brisk on shipping and speculative

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Receipts of Beans were again free, being
8941 sacks. Most of the offerings consist of
damaged stock, which exercises a depressing
infuence on the market, as already mentioned.

here. The quotations below represent dry lots

Bran and Middlings continue firm and un

The circular of Somers & Co. says: I
"Total receipts of Hay show a diminution
of 800 tons from the arrivals of last week,
the records showing but 27C0 tons, as com
pared with 3500 for our last . report. This
sudden lessening was very largely caused be
cause of there being practically no market to
day (election day). The railroads received no
freight and but . one car of Hay was side
tracked. Another reported ahortaga in cars
will probably tend to decrease shipments so
that for the balance of the month we will
probably have no surplus sent In, which should
tend to hold the market rather steady for &
time. 'â¢''â¢ '
"No change In the outlook ' can Â¦ be reported,
for although we hear rumors that Oregon and
Washington are short 'of Hay. yet careful In
quiry fails to Rive any material promise of
trade In that direction. 8outhern California
continues to draw from our warehouse stocks,
but the Ban' Francisco market, does not seem
benefited In any way because of It. Local
trad* is quiet and apparently nothing but a
dry weather scare will Influence the trade here
to buy except for their Immediate* seeds.
"To turn up the situation, we would state
that until ' we have some good winter rains
the market should hold fairly: firm, both be-,
cause of the tendency of the farmer* to await
crop development* and the car scarcity, which
may continue for another month or two.

Collector Stratton Gives De
tails of the Latest Scandal
ill the Custom - House
My letter giving him opportunity to be
heard before he was removed is simply follow
lr= the civil service rules and has no connec
tion with any pending criminal proceedings. ,
As to Mr. UnÂ«cer"s reduction from position of
chief clerk to that of seizure clerk on July 1.
1003. I can only say that this was by order of
the department upon facts reported by the
BpeelaJ agents. Mr. â¢Unger's version of this lat
ter affair was submitted In writing, signed by
himself, to the special agents and forwarded
t*> the department.
The experted or complete report conducted
by the Auditor. Mr. Cope, going over every
Item for eighteen months past, since Mr. Un-
Ker had held his present position, consumed
more time than expected. It was, however,
forwarded by me with all dispatch to the de
partment at Washington and upon Its receipt I
was, on November 8, Instructed to prosecute
Mr. Unger criminally and to prefer charges
looking to his removal.
Two days later, on October 21, I laid thÂ«
facts then developed before the United States
District Attorney for his official Information.
He concluded that he would await Instructions
from either the Department of Justice or the
Treasury Department after my experted report
had been forwarded.
On the same day I notified the deDartrrtent
of these facts.
I declined to accept it, but suspended him
forthwith and notified thÂ« department of the
facts and statins that I would have the five
departments of the Custom-house concerned
ejtperted and would subsequently forward a
detailed account.
He made settlement on the same day, and
thereafter, on October 10. tendered his resig
nation as rierk In the customs service.
This defalcation did not occur in the seizure
department, but was money received at the
Custom-house through the malls In payment of
duties on parcels post. My suspicion was
aroused from something I saw about October
10. I at once began an Investigation, which
developed certain irregularities, ending . on
October 17, in ascertainment that $1505 had
been collected by Mr. Unger ajid not paid over,
such collections ranging during the last oix
months.
Collector Stratton says that neither
the Government nor any private indi
vidual has lost one cent by any of the
acts of Unger. When the balance due
the Government from Unger was ascer
tained in October last, he says, the full
amount, $1505, was paid -over and de
posited in the sub-treasury. Continu
ing Collector Stratton says:
Two years ago Unger was reduced in
rank because of an alleged discrepancy
of about $2000. The money was made
good and he was placed in a position
where it was believed he could not pos
sibly appropriate coin belonging to
others. â¢-Â¦
Th? criminal prosecution of Cress
Unger, former seizure clerk in the Cus
tom-house, having begun. Collector
Stratton yesterday consented to make
a statement regarding his knowledge
of the alleged irregularities. The case
was begun on instructions from Wash
ington, the Treasury Department or

cuted.

Edward F. Xiehaus. lumber dealer,
564 Brannan street, has changed his
mind and yesterday he swore to a war
rant before Police Judge Cabaniss for
the arrest of his missing cashier and
bookkeeper. Gilbert Simpson, on a
charge of felony pmhezzlement. The
amount alleged in the complaint is
$343. of whirh 5200 was returned on
demand. It is said, however, that the
total amount of Simpson's defalcations
will run up into the. thousands. Simp
son had been cashier and bookkeeper
for Xiehaus for eight years. On Oc
tcber 27 he disappeared and has not
hren heard of since. He lived with
his wife and three children at 2433
Sixth street, Berkeley, and his family
and Â¦ the Xiehaus family were very
friendly. At first Xiehaus refused to
prosecute Simpson.
Niehaus Clianccs His Mind
James Burke, after vainly trying to
wed slumber upon a bench in Ports
mouth square, hailed Patrolman Nel
son and requested that he be escorted
to the City Prison. "The planks are
softer .there," he facetiously remark
ed, "and although I abhor, sleeping in
an' impure atmosphere I. cannot 'coax
sleep to. visit me upon this couch of
adamant.*! When the'policeman in
formed Judge .Mogan .. that Mr. Burke
was a chronic : vagrant, albeit a man
of fine intellectual attainments,, a
twenty-four hour sentence was im
posed. . . â¢
Harry Hughes, who responded to a
judicial interrogation by proclaiming
himself a "hotel bellhop from Spring
field, Illinois," had a skeleton key in
his possession when he was caught in
the act of exploring Mr. Monaghan's
apartment at 681 Howard street. To
the'policeman who arrested him Master
Hughes explained that, he had entered
the room by mistake while he was
seeking a friend of his by the name of
Jack Robinson, j The same policeman
told Judge Mogan that the defendant
was one. of. a trio of boys who made
a specialty of entering rooms in board
ing houses by means of skeleton keys
and stealing valuables therefrom. So
the youth from Illinois was remanded
for. further investigation.
William Dorsey, who was charged
with having forgotten to restore to
Gildea Bros., clothiers, a -ack contain
ing $600, which he found In their store
on Market street when he was assist
ing them to remove their stock and
fixtures, Informed Judge Cabaniss that
he never had the remotest intention of
adhering to the treasure. After finding
it he had deposited it In a saloon, his
purpose being to Inform its owners of
its whereabouts, but he took a few
drinks and then lost all remembrance
of the incident. Having recovered their
money the complainants were reluctant
to prosecute and Judge Cabaniss dis
missed the man of defective memory.
The Judge hinted that he might com
pel Mr. Grassel to do something even
more disagreeable than contributing to
the maintenance of his offspring. Sen
tence reserved till to-day.
"I ain't fknockln,' I tell you. All I
want the Judge to do is to make you
take care of this baby. It's as much
yours as mine, ain't it?"
"Gert, if that ain't knockin', what
is It?" said the man, in a tone that was
a wail.
"Knock nothin'," was the rejoinder.
"If I wanted to knock you I could tell
the Judge about the way you coaxed
me to be a bad woman and support
you when we were in Sacramento. But
I ain't knockin'."
"George is a sign painter and could
earn good wages if he would work,"
she informed Judge Mogan, "but when
he's ..not loafing in a poker room at 316
Grant avenue he's spejidlng his time
with his first or second wife, and the
baby and I may starve if we must de
pend upon him."
"Gertie, you know that ain't so," the
defendant protested, in sorrowful tone.
"You are trying to knock me, Gert;
you know you are."
Mrs. Gertrude Grassel accused her
husband, George, of neglecting to pro
vide for their elght-months-old babe,
and '.incidentally alleged that he de
voted less, attention to her than he di
vided between two "former helpmeets,
who had divorced him.
J..B. Keesler, who was en route from
a village in Georgia to Gait. Cal.. when
his watch was stolen, produced docu
mentary, evidence to support his alle
gation that Patrick J. Silk, teamster,
was the thief. His pockets were tight
ly packed with papers. Asked to state
his name, he nshed out a book with
his cognomen stamped in gilt letters
on its covfjr, and also submitted a visit-
Ing card similarly inscribed. When his
proprietorship of the watch was ques
tioned he silently thrust forward a
bill of sale to show that he paid the
sum of $2 50 for the timepiece Just be
fore he departed from sunny Georgia.
When the attorney for the defense in
quired as to the complainant's present
residence, the deBlred enlightenment
was tendered in the form of a receipt
for one week's rent of a room at 127
Natoma street. Then the lawyer asked
the complainant's age, and ere the an
swer could be furnished in the shape
of a birth certificate bound with red
tape Judge Cabaniss dismissed the
charge as not proven. Clerk "Barney"
Conlan, although immersed to his ears
in work, could not resist Mr. Keesler's
request that he j be furnished with a
properly indorsed * certificate of the
Judge's order of dismissal.
But the disorderly conduct of the de
fendants could not be gainsaid, and
they were fined $5 apiece.
Andrew Craig and Antonio Acuna,
shipmates, were charged with disturb
ing the peace of a saloon at Vallejo
and Dupont streets. The complaining
witness was the bartender' of the es
tablishment, whose testimony was that
the two mariners played pool, but did
not purchase drinks sufficient to offset
the wear and tear of the table and
cues, and when he endeavored to pre
cipitate their consumption of liquids,
they "made rough house."
"Thot mon kens mair thon he's
cracked tae yae," quoth Mr. Craig to
Judge Mogan. "Antonio an' mysel did
play wuth th 1 cues an' ba's, an* we
drankit beer ee'n time a game wur
feenished. But wae didna mak' human
tanks o' oorsels, an' thot's th' reeson
this Dotmon felt sair. He emptied oot
oor glassies an' filled 'em fu' again
wi'oot oor authority an' askit us tae
pay for leequor wae didna dreenk."
Every word of which was cor
roborated by Seaman Acuna, with the
addendum that besides trying to force
the sale of beer, the bartender obtrud
ed advice as to how certain shots
should be made.
"Wen Oi punched a 'ball ta stab
,board," Mr. Acuna averred, "this
bloomin barman, chips in an' sals Oi
oughter punched! it 'ard a port. An"
once Oi caught 'im in th' hact o* rol
lin' a ball inter a pocket so as ter
'urry up th' game an' sell more beer.
Blimme if Oi never saw a bloke push

"If I were young and pretty," she
bitterly complained, "it's love he would
have made to me Instead of running
me in."
Skelly, who certainly, is not an Ado
nis, hotly resented the imputation, and
as the woman is an old offender the
Judge sentenced her. to six months'
imprisonment.

Curry insisted that he go ahead and
dispose of. the matter there and then.
Mrs. Regan objected and it was her
objection that provoked Mrs. Curry's

TOUGHING STORY
Of Baby's Dreadful Suffer-

CURSD BY CUTICURA,
Now His Skin Is as White
as a Snow Flake.
11 A terrible rash broke out on Char-
lie's poor little face .and spread to his
oeck, chest and back. I had never seen
anything quite like it before," writes
Mrs. Helena Rath of 821 10th Ave., N. Y.
City. "-The skin rose In little lumps,
/g^^. and matter came
f iTj ont. My baby's skin
m Li. was hot, and how
j^s^^^y, he did suffer. He
5^^^]!Â»^Z__ wouldn't eat, afcd

I to 8t Â°P because I
e^""^ -felt faint and my
back throbbed with pain. But the worst
pain of all was to see my poor little
boy burning with those nasty sores..
At last I was persuaded by a friend
across the street to try the Cuticura
Remedies. She gave me some Cuticura
Ointmentâ I think the box was about
half fall â and a piece of Cuticura Soap.
I followed the directions, bathing
Charlie and putting that nice Ointment
on the sores. Little by little, but so
surely, Charlie and I both got more
peace by day and more sleep by night.
The sores sort of dried up and went
away, and now Charlie is cored com-
pletely."
" Yes, that fat little boy by the win-
dow is Charlie, and his skin is as white
as a snow flake, thanks to the Cuticura
Remedies. I think everybody should
know about the Soap and Ointment,
and if It is going to help other mothers
with sick babies, go ahead and publish
what I have told you."
