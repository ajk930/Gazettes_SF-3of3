OF BLACK PETER

IHAVE: never known my friend to
be in better form, both mental and
physical, than in the year '95. His
increasing fame had brought with
it an immense practice, and I should
be guilty of an indiscretion if I were'
even to hint at the identity of some
of the illustrious clients whd crossed
our humble threshold in Baker street.
Holmes, however, like all great artist?,
lived for his art's sake, and, save in
the case of the Duke of Holdernesse.
I have seldom known him to claim any
large reward for his inestimable serv-.
ices. So unworldly was heâ or so capri
ciousâ Vhat he frequently refused- his
help to the powerful and wealthy where '
the problem made no appeal to his
sympathies, while he would devote
weeks of most intense application to
the affairs of some humble client whose
case presented those strange. and dra
matic qualities which appealed to his
imagination and challenged ' his inge
nuity.
In this memorable year ' '95 a curi- '
ous and incongruous succession of cases
had engaged his attention, ranginK
from hU - famous investigation of the
sudden death of Cardinal Tosca â an in
quiry w hh.-h was carried out Ibv him
at th express desire of his Holiness.,
the Pope â dov.n to his arrest of *\Vii
son, the notorious canary-trainer, which
remo\ed a. plague spot from the East
Knd of Lundon. Close on the heels
of these two famous cases came the
tragedy of Woodman's Lee, and the
very obscure circumstances" which sur-".
loundeu the death of Captain Peter ;
Carey. No record of the doings of Mr.
Shtrlock Holmes would be complete
which did, not Include some account of
this very unusual affair.
Ourir.g the ftrst week : of Jury* my
Iriend had been absent so often and so
long from our lodgings that 1 knew
he had' something. on hand. The fact
that' Keveral rough-looking men called
during that time and inquired' for Cat>
tain Basil . made me understand' that"'
Hoiu â  was working somewhere under"
or. of ] th> numerous disguises and'
Mmci with which he concealed his*
own formidable identity. He had at'
least five small refuges in different*
parts of London, in which he was able
to chaa^e his personality. He said'
nothinc; of his business to me. and it
was not my habit to force a confidence.
The first positive >:rn which he gave
me of ihe direction which hisjnvesti- t
gation was taking was an eAraordinarv '
one. He bad gone out before break
fast, and I had sat down to mine when s?
he strode into the room, his hat upon
his head and a huge barbed-headed
spear tucked like an umbrella under
his I rm. - s
"Good gracious.' Holmes!" I cried.
"You don't mean to say that yo\i have'
been walking about London with that
thirc - â¢ ;â¢'!./
"I drove to the butcher's and back."
"The butcher's?" :*;:;
"And 1 return with an excellent ap
petite. There can be no question, my
<sear Watson, of the value of exercise â¢
before breakfast. But I am -prepared *
to bet that you will not guess the form
that my exercise has taken."'
"I will not attempt it." â 
He chuckled as he poured Out the '
coffee. ~
"If you could have looked into Al
lardyce's back shop you would ' have
seen a dead pig swung from a hook in
the ceiling, and a gentleman in his
srirt sleeves furiously stabbing at it
with this weapon. I was that energetic
person, and I have satisfied myself that '
by no exertion 'of my strength can I ,
transfix the" pig with a single blow. ;
Perhaps you would care to try?" ' ' ',
"Not for worlds. But why were you
doing this?" l^X^v
"Because it seemed to me to have an '
indirect bearing upon the mystery of
Woodman's IvÂ»e. Ah. Hopkins. I got j
your wire last night, and I have been i
expecting you. Come and Join us." '.
Our visitor was an exceedingly alert .
man, thirty years of age, dressed in a j
quiet tweed suit, but retaining the i
erect bearing of one who was accus- ,
tomed to official uniform. I recognized i
him at once as Stanley Hopkins, a ,
>oung police Inspector, for whose fu- > '
ture Holmes had high hopes, while he ,
in turn professed the admiration and ,
respect of a pupil for^ the scientific i
methods of the famous amateur. Hop- |
kins' brow was clouded, and he sat ;
down with an air .of deep dejection. â¢ )
"No, thank you. sir. I breakfasted
before I came^round. I spent the night :
in town, for I came tn> yesterday to Â
report." .' . *.-V i
And what had you to renort?"
"Failure, sir; absolute failure." j
"You have made no progress?" â 
"None." '
"Dear me! I must have a look at the |

"I. wish to heavens that you would, i
Mr. Holmes., 'lt's: my first big chance, i

what do you . make of that tobacco- . |

Hopkins looked surprised. |

that he slept every night. It was a lil- j;

and allowed \no j other foot to cross the

notice was taken. On rising at seven
one of the maids noticed that the dopr
of the hut was open, but so great was
the terror which the man caused that
it was midday before the women would
venture down to see what had become
of him. Peeping into the open door,
they saw a sight which sent them
flying, with white faces, into the vil
lage. "Within an hour I was on the
spot and had taken over the case.

got a shake when I put my head
into that little" house. ' It was dronins
like a, harmonium with the flies and
bluebottles, and the floor and " wall 3
were like a slaughter house. He had
called it a cabin, and a cabin it > was.
sure enough, for you would . have
thought that you were in a ship. There
was a bunk at one end. a sea-chest,
maps and charts, a picture,, of , the Sea
Unicorn, a line of logbooks on a shelf,
all exactly as one would expect to
find it in a captain's room. And there.
in the middle of i it. was the man him
seltrhia. tace. listed USSA^IQaJ. soul
In torment, and his great brindled
beard stuck upward in his aarony.
Right through his broad breast a steel
harpoon had been driven, and it had
sunk deep into the wood of the wall be
hind him. He was pinned like a beetle
on a card. Of course, hs w as quite dead,
and had been so from the instant that
he had uttered that last yell of agony.
I know your methods, air. and I ap
plied them. Before I permitted any
thing to be moved I examined most
carefully the ground outside and also
the floor of the room. There were no
footmarks."
"Meaning that you saw none?"
"i assure you, sir, that there were
none."
"My good Hopkins. I have in.vestisat
ed many crimes,' but I have never vet
seen one which was committed by a
flying creature. As, long as the crim
inal remains" upon tw* legs so long
must ' there :be some indentation. , some
abrasion, some trifling displacement
which can be detected by the scientific
searcher. It is incredible rhat this
blood-bespattered ~ room contained ; no
: trace -which could-have aided us. I
â  understand, â  however, â¢ from the inauest
â¢ that there were some 'objects Â» which

The fact that.the grime was committed
at ', two in \ the . morning, ' and, yet Peter
Carey was fully dressed, suggested that
â¢he had an appointment with the mur
derer, i which si 3s i 3 * borne â¢ out 'by Â» the , factthat a bottle "of rum and two dirty
glasses stood upon the table."
"Yee," said Holmes: "I think that
both inferences are permissible. Was
there any other gplrlt but rum in the
room?"
"Yes, there was a tantalus contain
ing brandy and whisky on the sea
chest. It is of no importance to us.
however, since the decanters were full,
and it had therefore not been used."
â¢ For all that, its presence has some
significance." said Holmes. 'However.
let us hear some more about the ob
jects which do seem to you to Dear
upon the case."
"There was this tobacco pouch upon
the table."
"What part of the table?"
"It lay in the middle. It was of
coarse sealskin â the straight-haired
skin, with a leather thong to bind -it.
Inside was 'P. C on the flap. There
was half an ounce of stronÃ ship's to
bacco in it."
"Excellent! What more?"
Stanley Hopkins drew from his pocket
a drab-covered note-book, the outside.
rough and worn, the leaves discolored.
On the first page were written the
initials "J. H. N." and the date "1883.
Holmes laid it on the table and ex
amined it in his minut.- way, while
Hopkins and 1 gazed over each
shoulder, On the second page were
the printed letters "C. P. R.." and then
came several sheets of numbers.
Another heading was -'Argentine."
another "Costa Rica," and another
"San Paulo," each with pages of signs
and figures after it. . j
"What do you make of these?" asked
Holmes. t â ,
"They appear to be lists of Stock
Exchange securities. I thought that
â¢J. H- N." were the initials of a broker,
and that C. P. K." may have been his
client."
â¢Try Canadian Pacific Kail way." said
Holmes.
Stanley Hopkins swore between his
teeth, and struck his thigh with his
clenched hand.
hat a tool I have been:" he cried.
uurse, it is ;<> you say. Then "J.
H. H. are the only initials we have to
solve. 1 have already examined the old
k Exchange lists, and I can find
â c in lfc&3, either in the house or
among the outside brokers, whose
c correspond with these. Yet I
i pel that the clew is the most important
.hat I hold. You will admit. Mr.
Holmes, that there is a possibility that
these initials are those of the second
person who was present â in other
wordf, of the murderer. I would also
urge that the introduction into the case
of a document relating to large masses
Suable securities gives us for the
first time some indication of a motive
â¢ crime."
Sherlock Holmes' face showed that
he was thoroughly taken aback by this
new development.
"1 must admit both your points,"
said be. "I confess that this note-book,
which did not appear at the inquest,
modifies any views which I may have
formed. I had come to a theory of the
crime in which I can find no place for
this. Have you endeavored to trace
any of the securities here mentioned?"
"Inquiries are now being made at the
offices, but I fear that the complete
register of the stockholders of these
South American concerns is in South
America, anfi that some weeks must
c before we can trace the shares."
Holmes had been examining the cover
of the note-book with his magnifying
lens.
Purely there is some discoloration
here," said he.
"Yes, sir, it is a blood-stain. I told
you that I picked the book off the
floor."
'Was the blood-stain above or be
low?"
'On the side next the boards. "
' Which proves, of course, that the
book was dropped after the crime waa
committed."
" Exactly, Mr. Holmes. I appreciated
that point, and I conjectured that it
w&s dropped by the murderer in his
hurried flight. It lay near the door."
"I suppose that none of these securi
ties have been found among the prop
erty of the dead man?"
sir ."
â¢ Have you any reason to suspect rob
bery? "
sir. Nothing seemed to have
been touched."
"Dear me, it is certainly a very in
teresting case. Then there was a knife,
was there not?"
A sheath-knife, still in its sheath.
It lay at the feet of the dead man.
Mrs. Carey has identified it as being
her husband's property."
Holmes was lost in thought for some
time.
Well," said he, at last, "I suppose I
shall have to come out and have a look
at it."
Stanley Hopkins gave a cry of joy.
"Thank you. sir. That will, indeed,
be a weight off my mind."
Holmes shook his finger at the in
spector.
"It would have been an easier task a
week ago," said he. "But even now
my visit may not be entirely fruitless.
Watson, if you can spare the time, I
should be very glad of your company.
If you will call a four-wheeler, Hop
kins, we shall be ready to start for
Forest Row in a quarter of an hour. "
Alighting at the small wayside sta
tion, we drove for some miles through
the remains of widespread wooas,
which were once part of that great
forest which for so long held the
Saxon invaders at bay â the impene
trable "weald," for sixty years the
bulwark of Britain. Vast sections of
it have been cleared, for this is the
seat of the first iron works of the
country, and the trees have been felled
to smelt the ore. Now the richer
fields of the north have absorbed the
trade and nothing save these ravaged
groves and great scars in the earth
show the work of the past. Here, in
a clean ng upon the green slope of a
1 a long, low stone hrtllf .
approached by a curving drive run
ning through the field. Nearer the
road, surrounded by three sides
by bushes, was a small outhouse, one
window and the door facing in our
direction. It was the scene of the
murder.
.nley Hopkins led us first to the
house, where he introduced us to a
haggard, gray-haired woman, the
widtnv of the murdered man, whose
gaunt and deep-lined face, with the
furtive look of terror in the depths of
her redÂ»rimmed eyes, told of the years
of hardship and ill-usage which she
had endured. With her was her
daughter, a pale, fair-haired girl,
whose eyes blazed defiantly at us as
she told us that she was glad that her
father was dead and that she blessed
the hand which had struck him down.
It was a terrible household that Black
Peter Carey had made for himself,
and it was with a sense of relief that
we found ourselves in the sunlight
again and making our way along a
)>&th which had been worn across the
fields by the feet of the dead man.
The outhouse â was the simplest of
dwelling*. wooden-walled, shingle
roofed, one window beside the door
and one on the farther side. Stanley-
Hopkins drew the key from his pocket
and had etooÂ«>ed to the lock, when
he paused with a look of attention and
surprise upon his face.
"Some one has been tampering with
it," he said.
There could be no doubt of the fact.
The woodwork was cut and the
scratches showed white through the
paint, as if they had been that instant
done. Holmes had been examining
the window.
"Some one has tried to force this
also. Whoever it was ha* failed to
make his way in. He must have been
a very poor burglar."
"This is a most extraordinary thing,"
said the inspector. "I could swear
that these marks were not here yes
terday evening."
"Some curious person from the vil
lage, perhaps," I suggested.
"Very unlikely. Few of them would
dare to set foot in the grounds, far
less try to force their way into the
cabin. What do you think of it, Mr.
Holmes?"
"I think that fortune is very kind
to us."
"You mean that the person will
come again ?"
"It is very probable. He came ex
pecting to find the door open. He
tried to get In with the "blade of a
small penknife. He could not manage
it. What would he do?"
"'ome again next night with a more
useful tool." /
"So I should say. It will be our fault
if we are not there to receive him.
Meanwhile, let me see the inside of the
cabin."
The traces of the tragedy had been re
moved, but the furniture within the
little room stil! stood as it had been
on the night of the crime. For two
hours, with most intense concentra
tion. Holmes examined every object in
turn, but his face showed that his
quest was not a successful one. Once
only he paused in his patient investi
gation.
"Have you taken anything off this
shelf, Hopkins?"
"No, I have moved nothing"
"Something has been taken. There
is less dust in this corner of the shelf
than elsewhere. It may have been a
book lying on its side. It may have
been a box. Well, well, I can do noth
ing more. Let us walk In these beau
tiful woods, Watson, and give a few
hours to the birds and the flowers. We
shall meet you here later, Hopkins, and
se* if we can come to closer quarters
with the gentleman who has paid this
visit in the night."
It was past 11 o'clock when we
formed our little ambuscade. Hopkins
was for leaving the door of the hut
open, but Holmes was of the opinion
that this would rouse the suspicions
of the stranger. The lock was a per
fectly simple one, and only a strong
blade was needed to push it back.
Holmes also suggested that we should
wait, not inside the hut, but outside
it among the bushes which grew round
the farther window- In this way we
should be able to watch our man if he
struck a Jight, and see what his object
was in this stealthy nocturnal visit.
It was a long and melancholy vigil,
and yet brought with it something of
the thrill which the hunter feels when
he Jies beside the water pool and waits
for the coming of the w tnir.sty beast of
prey. What savage creature was it
which might steal upon us out of the
darkness? Was it a fierce tiger of
crime, which could -only be
taken fighting iiard, with
flashing fang and claw, or
\\"Uld it prove to be some
skulking jackal, danger
ous only to the weak
and unguarded?
In absolute silence
we crouched among
the bushes, Waiting
for whatever might
tome- At first the
steps of a few be
*<rted villagers, or the
sound of voices from the village, light
ened our vigil, but one by one these In
terruptions died away, and an absolute
stillness fell upon us, save for the
chimes of the distant church, which
told us of the progress of the night,
and for the rustle and whisper of a
fine rain falling * amid the foliage
which roofed' us in.
Half-past two had chimed, and it
was the darkest hour which precedes
the dawn, when we all started as a
low but sharp click came from the di
rection of the gate. Some one had en
tered the drive. Again there was a long:
silence, and I had begun to fear that
it was a falae alarm, when a stealthy
step was heard upon the other side of
the hut, and a moment later a metallic
scraping and clinking.- The man was
trying to force the lock- This time his
skill was greater or his tool was bet
ter, for there was a sudden snax> and
a creak of the hinges. Then a match
was struck, and next instant the
steady light from a candle filled- the
interior of the hut. Through the gauze
curtain our eyes were all riveted upon
the scene within
THE SAN- FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL!.
The nocturnal visitor was a young
man, frail and thin, with a black
mustache, which intensified the dead
ly pallor of his face. He could not
have been much above twenty years of
age. I have never seen any human
being who appeared to be in such a
pitiable fright, for his teeth were
visibly chattering. and he was
shaking in every limb. He was dressed
like a gentleman, 4 n Norfolk jacket and
knickerbockers, with a cloth cap upon
hits head. We watched him staring
round with frightened eyes. Then he
â¢ laid the candle-end upon the table, and
disappeared from our view Into. one of
the corners. He returned with a large
book, one of the logbooks which. formed
a line upon the shelves. Leaning on the
table, he rapidly turned over the leaveg
* of this volume until he came to the en
try which he sought. Then, with an
angry gesture of his clenched hand, he
closed the book, replaced it in the cor
ner and put out the light. He had
hardly turned to leave the hut when
Hopkins' hand was on the fellow's col
lar, and I heard his loud gasp of terror
as he. understood that he was taken.
The i candle was relit, and there was our
wretched captive, shivering and cower
ing in the grasp of the detective. He
%ank down upon the sea chest? and
looked helplessly from one of us to the
other.
"Now, my fine fellow," said Stanley
Hopkins, "who are you, and what
dp you want here? "
The man pulled himself to
gether, and faced us with an
effort at self-composure.
"You are detectives, I
suppose?" said he. "You
imagine I am connected
with the death of Cap
tain Peter Carey. I as
sure that that I am in
"We'U see about
that," said Hopkins.
"First of all, what is
your name?"
â¢It is John Hopley
I saw Holmes and
Hopkins exchange
a quick glance
"What are you fiolng hereY"
"Can I speak confidentially?"
"No, certainly not."
"Why should I tell you?"
"If you have no answer, it may go
badly with you at the trial."
The young man winced.
"Well, I will tell you," he said. "Why
should I not? And yet I hate to think
of this old scandal gaining a new lease
of life. Did you ever hear of Dawson
and Neligan?"
I could see, from Hopkins* face, that
he never had, but Holmes was keenly
interested. .
"You mean the West-country bank
ers," said he. "They failed for a a mil
lion, ruined half the county families of
Cornwall, and Neligan disappeared."
"Exactly. Neligan was my father."
At last we r -re getting something
positive, and yet it seemed a long gap
between an absconding banker and
Captain Peter Carey pinned against the
wall with one of his own harpoons. We
all listened intently to the young man's
words.
"It was my father who was really
concerned. Dawson had retired. I was
only ten years of age at the time, but
I was old enough to feel the shame and
horror of it all. It has always been
said that my father stole all the securi
ties and fled. It is not true. It was his
belief that if he were given time In
which to realize them all would be well
and every creditor paid in full. He
started in his little yacht for Norway
just before the warrant was issued for
his arrest. I can remember that last
night, when he bade farewell to my
mothei 1 . He left us a list of the securi
ties he was taking, and he swore that
lie would come back with his honor
cleared, and that none who had trusted
him would suffer. Well, no word was
ever heard from him again. Both the
yacht and he vanished utterly. We be
lieved, my mother and I, that he and it,
with the securities that he had taken
with him were at the bottom of
the sea. We had a faithful
ftiend, however, who is a business
man, and it was he who discovered
some time ago that some of the securi
ties which my father had with him had
reappeared on the London market. You
can imagine our amazement. I spent
months in trying to trace them, and at
last, after many doubtings and diffi
culties, I discovered that the original
seller had been- Captain Peter Carey,
the owner of this hut.
"Naturally, I made some inquiries
about the man. I found that he had
been in command of a whaler which
was due to return from the Arctic seas
at the very time when my father was
crossing to Norway. The autumn of
that year was a stormy one, and there
was a long succession of southerly
gales. My father's yacht may well
have been blown to the north, and
there met by Captain Peter Carey 1 *
Rhip. If that were bo, what had become
of my father? In any case, if I
'â¢ould prove from Peter Carey's
evidence how these securities
came on the market it
would be a proof that
n*y father had not
sold them, and
â that he had no
view to per
sonal profit
when he took

tention of seeing the captain, but it
was at this moment that his terrible
death occurred. I read at the inauest
a description of his cabin, in which it
stated that the old logbooks of his
vessel were preserved in it. It struck
me that if I could see what occurred
in the month of August. 1883. on board
the Sea Unicorn, I might settle the
mystery of my father's fate. I tried
last night to get at , these logbooks.

' "The. line of investigation which I
have -myself been pursuing. It may
gfve'us. nothing. I cannot tell. But
at least I 6hall follow it to the end."
Several/letters were waiting for
Holmes at Baker street. He snatched
one of them up, opened It, and burst
out into -a triumphant chuckle of
laughter.
"Excellent. Watson! The alterna
tive develops. Have you telegraph
forms? Just write a couple of mes
sages for me: 'Sumner, Shipping
Agent, Ratcliff Highway. Send three
men on. to tarrive ten to-morrow

shall hear the last ;of It forever."
1 ' Sharp at 'the hour named Inspector
Stanley Hopkins appeared, and we sat
down together to the excellent break
fast which Mrs. Hudson had prepared.
The young detective was in high spir
its at his success.
â - i 'YoU: really think that your solution
must be correct?" asked Holmes.
. "I could not imagine a more com
plete-case/*. â¢â
,* "It did not seem to me conclusive."
. "You astonish me. Mr. Holmes.
What more could one ask for?" .
. "Does your explanation cover every
point?" . : a@ibjfÃ^l
â Â» ., "Undoubtedly. I tind that young
Neligan arrived ai the Brambletye*
Hotel on the very '. iy of the crime.
He came on the pretense of playing
golf. â¢ His room was on the ground
floor, and he could get out when he
liked. That very night he went down
to Woodman's Lee. saw Peter Carey
at the. hut, quarreled with him, and
killed him with the harpoon. Then,
horrified by what he had done, he fled
out of the hut, dropping the note-book
which he had brought with . him in
order to question Peter â  Carey about
these different securities. You may
have observed that some of them were
marked with ticks, and the others â
the great majority â not. . Those
which are ticked have .been traced
on the London market, but the others,
presumably, were still in the posses
sion of Carey, and young Neligan, ac
cording to his own account, was anx
ious ;to recover them in order to do
the right thing by his father's cred
itors. After his flight he did not dare
to ; approach the hut again for some
time, but at last he forced himself to
do so in order to obtain the informa
tion which he needed. Surely that is
all simple and obvious."
Holmes smiled and shook his head.
"It seems to -me to have only one
drawback, Hopkins, and that Is that
it is intrinsically Impossible. Have
you tried to dffve a harpoon through
a body? No? Tut, tut. my dear sir,
you must really pay attention to these
details. My friend Watson could tell
you that I spent a whole morning in
that exercise. It is no easy matter,
and ": requires a strong and practiced
arm. But this ; blow was delivered
with such violence that the head of
the weapon sank deep into the wall.
Do you imagine , that this . anaemic
youth was capable of so frightful an
assault? Is he the man who hob
nobbed in rum and water with Black
Peter in the dead of the night? Was
it his profile that was seen on the
blind two nights before? No. no,
Hopkins, it is another and more for
mWable person for whom we must
seek."
The detective's face had grown
longer and longer during Holmes'
speech. His hopes and his ambitions
were all crumbling about him. But he
would not abandon his position with
out a struggle.
"You can't deny that Neligan was
present t:iat night. Mr. Holmes. The
book will prove that. I fancy that I have
evidence enough to satisfy a jury, even
if you are able to pick a hole in it.
Besides, Mr. Holmes, I have laid my
hand upon my man. As to this ter
rible person of yours, where is he?"
"1 rather fancy that he is on the
stair," said Holmes, serenely. "I
think, Watson, that you would do well
to put that revolver where you can
reach it." He rose and laid "a written
paper uyon a side-table. "Now we
are ready," said he.
tfhere had been some talking in
grutt voices outside, and now Mrs.
Hudson opened the door to say that
there were three men inquiring for
Captain Basil.
"Show them in one by one," said
Holmes. .
The first who entered was a little
rlbston-plppin of a man. with ruddy
rheeks and fluffy white side whiskers.
Holmes had drawn a letter from his
pocket.
"What name?" he asked.
"James Lancaster."
"I am sorry, Lancaster, but the
berth is full. Here is half a sovereign
for your trouble. Just step into this
room and wait there for a few
minutes."
The second man was a long, dried
up creature, with lank hair and sallow
cheeks. His name was Hugh Pattins.*
He also received his dismissal, his
half-sovereign and the order to wait.
The third applicant was a man of
remarkable appearance. A fierce bull
dog face was framed in a tangle of
hair and beard and two bold, dark
eyes gleamed behind the cover of
thick, tufted, overhung eyebrows. He
saluted and stood sailor-fashion, turn
ing his cap round in his hands.
"Your name?" asked Holmes.
"Patrick Cairns."
"Harpooner?"
"Yes, sir. Twenty-six voyages."
"Dundee. I suppose?"
"Ye*, sir."
"And ready to start with, an ax
ploring ship?"
'Yes, sir.'
"Wh it wage*?"
"Eight pounds a month."
"Could you start at once? If
"As soon as I get my kit."
"Have you your papers? "
"Yes. sir." He took a sheaf of
worn and greasy forms from his
po.-ket. Holmes glanced over them
and returned them.
"You are just the man I want."
said he. "Here's the agreement on
the side-table. If you. sign it. the
whole matter will be settled."
The aeaman lurched across the
room and took up the pen.
1 dhall I sign !#re?" he asked,
stooping over the table.
Holmes leaned over his shoulder
and passed both hands over his neck.
"This will do." said he.
I heard a â¢ click of steel and a
bellow like an enraged bull. The next
instant Holmes and the aeaman were
rolling on the ground together. He
was a man of such gigantic strength
that, even with the handcuffs which
Holmes had so deftly fastened upon
h'.a wrist*, he would have very quick
ly overpowered my friend had Hop
kins and I not rushed to his rescue.
Only when I pressed the cold muzzle
of the revolver to his temple did he at
last understand that resistance was
vain. We lashed his ankles with cord
and rose breathless from the struggle.
"I must apo:. size. Hopklna," said
Sherlock Holmes. "I fear that the
scrambled eppa are cold. However, you
will onjoy the rest of your breakfast
all the better, will you not. for the
thought that you have brought your
case to a triumphant conclusion?"
Stanley Hopkins was speechless with
amazement.
"I don't know what to say, Mr.
Holmes," he blurted out at last, with
a very red face. "It seems to me that
I have been making a fool of myself
from the beginning. I understand ifow.
what I should never have forgotten â N
that I am the pupil and you are the
master. Even now i see what you have
done, but I don t know how you did
it or what it signifies."
"Well, well." said Holmes good hu
moredly. "We all learn by experience,
and your lesson this time is that you
should never lose sight of the alterna
tive. You were so absorbed in young
Neligan that you could not spare a
thought to Patrick Cairns, the true
murderer of Peter Carey."
The hoarse voice of the seaman broke
in on our conversation.
"See >iere, mister." said he, "I maks
no complaint of being man-handled in
this fashion, but I would have you call
things by their right names. You say
I murdered Feter Carey; I say I kiTled
Peter Carey, and there's all the dif
ference. Maybe you don't believe what
I say; mrybe you think I am Just
slinging you a yarn. '
"Not* at all. " said Holmes. "Let us
hear what you have to say."
"It's soon told, and. by the Lord, ev
ery word of it is truth. I knew Black
Peter, and when he pulled out hts knifa
I whipped a harpoon through him
sharp, for 1 knew that it was him or
me. That's how he died. You can call
it murder. Anyhow, I'd as soon die
with a rope around my neck as with
Black Peters knife in my heart."
"How came you there 9 " asked
Holmes.
"I'll tell it you from the beginning.
Just sit up a little, so I can speak easy.
It was in S3 that it happenedâAu
gust of that year. Peter Carey waa
master of the Sea Unicorn, and I was
spare harpooner. We were coming out
of the ice pack on our way home, with
head winds and a week's southerly
gale, when we ticked up a little craft
that had been blown north. There waa
one man on her â a landsman. The crew
had thought she would founder and
had made for the Norwegian coast in
the dingy. I guess they were all
drowned. Well, we took him on board,
this man, and he and the skipper had
some long talks in the cabin. All the
baggage we took off '.v.th him was on*
tin box. So far as I know the man's
name was never mentioned, and on tha
second nijht he disappeared as if hÂ«
had never been. It was given out that
he had either thrown himself overboard
oi fallen overboard in the heavy
weather that we were having. Only
one man knew what hud happened to
h.m. and that was me, for. with my
own eyes, I saw the skipper tip up his
heels and put him over the rail in the
middle watch of a dark night, two
days before we sighted the Shetland
Lights.
"Well, I kept my knowledge to my
self, and waited to see what would
come of it. When we got back to Scot
land It was easily hushed up, and no
body askÂ«d any questions. A stranger
died by accident, and it was nobody's
business to inquire. Shortly after Peter
Carey g9ve up the sea. and It was long
years before I could find where ha was.
I guessed that he had done the deed
for the sake of what was in the tin
box and that he could afford now to
pay me well for keeping my mouth
shut.
"I found out where he was through
a sailor man that had met him in Lon
don, and down I went to squeeze him.
The first night he was reasonable
enough, and was ready to give me
what would make me free of the sea
for life. We were to fix It all two
nights later. When I came I found
him three parts drunk and in a vile
temper. We sat down and we drank
and we yarned about old times, but
the more he drank the less I liked toe
look on his face. I spotted that har
poon upon the wall and I thought I
might need it before I was through.
Then at last he broke out at me, spit
ting and cursing, with murder in his
eyes and a great claspknlfe in his
hand. He had not time to get it from
the sheath before I had the harpoon
through him. Heavens! what a yell
he gave! and his face gets between
me and my sleep. I stood there, with,
his blood splashing round me. and I '
waited for a bit, but all waa quiet,
so I took heart once more. I looked
round and there was the tinbox on the
shelf. I had as much right to It aa
Peter Carey anyhow, so I took It witn
me and left the hut. Like a fool I left
my baccy-pouch upon the table.
"Now I'll tell you the queerest part
of the whole story. I had hardly got
outside the hut when I heard some one
coming and I hid among the bushes.
A man came slinking along, went into
the hut. gave a cry as If he had seen a
ghost and legged It as hard as he could
run until he was out of sight. Who
he was or what he wanted is more
than I can tell. For my part I walked
ten miles, got a train at Tunbridge
Wells and so reached London and no
one the wiser.
"Well. when. I came to examine the
box I found there was no money In it
and nothing but papers that I would
not dare to sell. I had lost my hold
on Black Peter and was stranded In
London without a shilling. There was
only my trade left. I saw these adver
tisements about harpooners and high
wages so I went to the shipping agent*
and they sent me here. That's all I
know, and I say again that if I killed
Black Peter the law should glye me
thanks, for I saved them the price of
a hempen rope. "
A very clear statement." said
Holmes, rising and lighting his pipe.

he sat down and wrote, scarce seeing
the lines his pen tracedâ and rose and
paced the floor again. He took the
black phial from its drawer, but put It
back. There was something in him
which in this fierce crisis disdained to

After a little while he left the libra

Over th<> sreat. crow-fooled face of

The Courier had reserved its bitter- "
est attack. On the second day it pub
lished the stanzas entitled "Fare the
Well," signed by Gordon's name. He
saw them with a strange sensation, his
mind grasping for the cords he felt en
meshing him. his eyes fully opene<l
now to the devilish ingenuity of . hhÂ».
persecution.
But he himself stood appalled at the.
deadly effect of this attack. â  Innuendo '
was thrown aside: , invective took its
place. Paragraph, pamphlet and cari
cature held the lines up to odium. The
hypocrisy of a profligate! A cheap, in- .
sincere appeal to mawkish sympathy!
A tasteless, vulgar parade of a poseur
. strumming his heartstrings, on the
highway!
It came to Gordon with a start that
during the past forty-eight l\ours he
had forgotten his mail. â  He rang the
bell and asked for his letters..
"There are none, my lord."
No letters? And daily for a year his
table had been deluged with tinted and
perfumed , billets crested and sealed
with signets of great houses. No let
ters! .
"Who has called to-day?" .
Fletcher's honest eyes could scarcely
meet ms master s. Mr. noDnouse
called this morning," and Mr. Dallas
this afternoon."
"That is all?"
"Yes, your lordship."
Gordon went to the fireplace arid
stared down dazedly into the embers.
He had been a santon: now he was an
Ishmaelfte. a mark for the thrust of
every scurrilous poetaster who wielded
a pcn â a chartered Bluebeard â another
Mirabeau whom the feudalists discov
ered to be a monster! The world had
learned with pleasure that he was a
wretch. Tom Moore was In Ireland,
BhfiMsii dead. Of all he knew only
two rallied to his support â Hobhouse,
the stuidy, undemonstrative, likable
companion of his early travels, andâ
DallasV
Gordon laughed bitterly. He had
been London's favorite. Now. without
justice or reason, it covered him with
obloquy and went by on the other side.
There had followed days and nights
of mental agony, of inner crying-out
for reprisalâ hours of fierce longing for
his child, when he had sought relief in
walking unfrequented streets from
dark to dawn, in desultory composi
tion, more often in the black bottle that
lay in the library drawer. Meager news
had reached his sister, and a brave,
true message from her was the only
cooling dew that fell into his fiery
Sahara of suffering. A packet left by
a messenger roused him to a white
fuiy. It was from Sir Samuel Romilly,
the solicitor under his retainer. Sir
Samuel had reversed his allegiance.
His curt note inclosed a draft of seD
atation proposed by Sir Ralph Mil
bs.nke. and though couched in judicial
phrases, voiced a threat unmistakable.
Almost a round of the clock Gordon
Bat with this paper before him, his
meals untasted. His wife at that mo-
HALLIE ERMINIE RIVES
ment was with Adaâ his child and
hers!â at her father's house in Sea
ham. She had read the attacksâ knew
their falseness â knew and would not
deny. Now he knew why. What she
wanted was written in that document:
freedom and her daughter. She would
enprulf him in calumny only so the
world would justify her in her self
righteous desertion. And lest he put it
to the test, lest he refuse to be con
demned unheard and demand the ar
bitrament of an open though prejudiced
tribunal, she threatened him with what
further veiled accusations he could not
imagine. Good God! Was there any
thing more to accuse him of? Better
any appeal to publicity now than this
step which shut him from Ada!
Suppose he made this appeal. There
was no justice In public opinion. In
his case, it was already poisoned. Al
ready it dubbed him a Nero, a Caligula,
a Richard Third! Add to the present
outcry new and more terrible charges â
the formless Insinuations of Sir Ralph
âand what might not its verdict be?
It would Justify his wife, applaud the
act which robbed him of his child! And
these dark indictments, though false,
w ould be no less an evil legacy for that
daughter whom he loved with every
fiber of his being.
To consent to lose Ada forever â or to
risk both her loss and her blight. To
battle, and jeopardize her life's hap
piness perhaps â or to yield and give
tacit admission to the worst the world
said of him, her father!
Night fell. At last he stirred and his
square shoulders set. "To wait," he
saidâ "to wait and be patient. That
is all that is left. Whatever I must do,
the world shall not see me cringe. The
celebrity I have wrung from it has
been in the teeth of all opinions and
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALII
prejudices. I will show no white feath
er now! "
He laid the document aside, rose and
looked in the glass. His face was hag
gard, worn; there were listless lines
under his eyes. He summoned Fletch
er and dressed with all his old scrupu
lousness â such a costume as he had
worn the afternoon he had waked to
fame. With a thought, perhaps, of
that day, he drew a carnation through
his buttonhole. Then he left the house
and turned his steps toward ijrury
Lane.
The fog waa gone, the air lay warm
and pleasant, and a waxing moon
shamed the street lamps. He
passed down St. James street and came
opposite White's Club. He had no
thought of entering. Lord Petersham
descended the steps as he approached,
his dress exquisite, his walking stick
held daintily between thumb and fore
finger like a pinch of snuff. The fog's
eyes met Gordon's in a blank stare.
A group of faces showed in the bow
window and for an instant Gordon
hesitated, the old perverse spirit tempt
ing him to enter, but he resisted it.
The first act was on when he reached
Drury Lane Theater, and the lobby
was empty save for the usual loungers
and lackeys. The doors of the pit were
open and he stood behind the rustling
colors of Fops' Alley. He scanned the
house curiously, himself unobserved,
noting many a familiar face in the
boxes.
Night after night the pit had roused
to the veteran actor Kean. Night after
night Fops' Alley had furnished Its
quota of applause for a far smaller
part, played with grace and sprightll
ness â by Jane Clermont, the favorite
of the greenroom. Her first entrance
formed a finish to the act now drawing
to a close. To Gordon's overwrought
senses to-night theTe seemed some
strange tenseness in the air. Here and
there heads drew together whispering.
The boxes were too auiet.
As the final tableau arranged itself
and Jane advanced slowly from the
wings there was none of the usual
signs of 'approval. Instead a disturbed
shuffle made itself heard. She began
her lines smiling. An ugly murmur
overran the pit and she faltered.
Instantly a man's form leaned over
the edge of a box and hissed. The
watcher, staring from the shadow of
the lobby, recognized him with a quick
stab of significance â it was William
Lamb. The action seemed a concerted
signal. Some one laughed. An un
dulate hiss swept over the house like
a nest of serpents. Even some of the
boxes swelled its volume.
Jane shrank, looking frightenedly
about her. bewildered, her hands
clutching her gown; for the pit was on
its legs now, and epithets were hurled
at the stage. "Crede Gordon!" came
the derisive shout â a cry- taken up with
groans and catcalls â and a walking
stick clattered across the footlights.
The manager rushed upon the stage
and the heavy curtain began to de
scend.
"The baggage!" said a voice near
Gordon with a coarse laugh. "It's the
one they say he had in his house when
hie wife left him. Serves her right:"
Gordon's breath caught In his throat.
So this had been William Lamb's way!
Not an appeal to the court of ten paces
âan assassin in the dark with a blood
less weapon to slay him in the world's
esteem!
He heard the din rising from the
whole house as he crossed the lobby
and strode down the passageway lead
ing to the greenroom.
CHAPTER XVIII.
Gordon Stands at Bay.
Jane Clermont had reached it before
him, her eyes a storm of anger. She
tore the silver ornaments from her
costume, and dashed them at the feet
of the manager. "How dare they! How
dare they!" she flamed.
"Don't talk!" he snapped. "I must
go on with the play or they will be
in here in five minutes. Don't wait to
change your dress â go! go, I tell you!
Do you think I want my theater tum
bled about my ears?"
Ho cursed as the dulled uproar came
from beyond the dropped curtain.
Curious eyes had turned to Gordon,
faces zestful, relishing, as he paused in
the doorway. The girl had not seen
him. But at that moment hurried steps
came down the passage â a youth dart
ed past Gordon and threw an arm
about her. '
"Jane!" he cried, "we were there â
Mary and I â we saw it all! It is infa
mous!"
A flash of instant recollection deep
ened the vivid fire in Gordon's lock as
it rested on the boyish, beardless figure,
whose quaint dress and roving eyes,
bright and wild like a deer's, seemed
as incongruous in that circle of paint
and tinsel as in the squalor of the Fleet
Prison. Shelley went on rapidly
through Jane's incoherent words:
"Jane, listen! We're not poor now.
We came to the play to-night to tell
you the news. Old Sir Bysshe, my
grandfather, is dead and the entail
comes to me. We sail for the cor.ti
net at daybreak. Mary is waiting in
the carriage. Come with us, Jane, and
Jet England, go."
On the manager's face drops of per
spiration had started. "Aye, go!" he
foamed. "The quicker the better! His
lordship is waiting "
He shrank back, the sneer throttled
on his lips, for there was that in Gor
don's colorless features, his sparkling
eyes, at which the man's tongue clove
to the roof of his mouth.
"George Gordon!" exclaimed Shelley
under his breath.
Jane's glance had followed his and
she saw the figure at the door for the
ritst time, as Gordon spoke:
"Cowards!" he said. "Cowards:" â
a shriveling rage was making his
speech thick. "A thousand against one!
It is I they hate, and they vent their
hatred of me upon a woman! Such is
the chivalry of this puddle of water
worms they call London!"
A sudden admiration swept the girl.
"You dare them, too! You are not
afraid!" She turned on the manager
passionately. "I wouldn't play for them
again for all London! I despise you all,
in front of the curtain and behind it.
Liarsâ all liars! Come, Bysshe, I will
go with you."
Shelley held out his hand to Gordon
with an open, friendly, "Good-by, my
lord."
Gordon had been looking at him
steadily â looking, but with a strange
irrelevance, seeing really himself,
standing in his own room at a long
ago dawn, a goblet of brandy in his
hand, and in his heart a determination
rising anewâ a wish to be like the
youth whose clasp now met his own,
with a like serenity and purpose, a soul
to which fame meant least, truth and
right all! In that year of dazzle be
fore his marriage he had quenched that
determination. He had worshiped th',-
Great Beast. He had lived the world's
life and played its games and accepted
its awards. Now he suffered its pun
ishments!
Malicious faces were peering in at
the street entrance. The pit had over
flowed into, the lobby, the lobby into
the street, and the numbers swelled
from the hordes of the pave whose
jargon banter rlew back and forth. The
jeering voices' came plainly down the
brick passageway.
"I will sac , you to your carriage,"
said Gordon, and went out with them.
They passed to the. vehicle from
which Mary Shelley's frightened face
looked â through a vociferous hu
man lane, that groaned and whistled
In gusto.
"There's the jade; an" 'er lordship
with 'er, too!"
"Which is "im?"
"W'y, i'm with the leg."
At the gibe which followed Gordon
smiled mirthlessly. This blind rabble,
egged on by hatred that utilized for its
cnd3 the crass dislike of the scum for
the refinedâ what was it to him? He
knew its masters!
As Jane .took her seat the jeers re
doubled. Across the heads between
him and the surging entrance of tha
theater he saw the sneering, heavy
lidded face of William Lamb. Tha
sight roused the truculent demon of
Btubbornness in him. With a flare oC
unrecking impertinence and a racing
recollection of a first dinner at Mel
bourne House, when he had given Lady
Caroline Lamb such a blossom from
his coat, Gordon drew the carnation
from his buttonhole- and handed it to
- Jane Clermont.
The crowd had looked to see him
enter with the others; now as the ye- â¢
hicle rolled away, leaving him stand
, ing alone, the clamor, sharpened â by
his nonchalant act and by the smile
â which they could not translate, rose
more derisive, more boldly mixed with
Insult. They were overcoming that dull
irborn fear of the clod for the noble.
Tnere was menace in what they said,
a foreshadowing of peril that might
have fallen but for a diversion.
A coach, adroitly handled, whirled up ""
to the curbstone, and a man leaped
to the pavement. Gordon felt a 'hand
touch his arm. - y
"The carriage, my lord," said Fletch-
er.
< The valet, guessing better than his
master, had followed him. A sense of
the dog-like fidelity of the old servitor
smote Gordon and softened the bitter
smile on his lips. Only an instant he.
hesitated before he entered the car
riage, and in that instant a hand
grasped at the horses' heads, but the
coachman's whip fell and the plunging
animals made an aisle through which
the vehicle, hissed and hooted,, rolled in
safety.
As it drew away a young man, dark
and Oriental-looking, came through the
crowd, staring wonderingly at the ex
citement. He was one who more than
once on that spot had watched Gor
don's approaching carriage with black
envy and jealousy â same who had
stood with Jane Clermont >>n the night
Dr. Cassidy's suspicious gaze had made
him draw closer into the shadow of
the doorway. At the' names the crowd
coupled, he started, paled and hu-rled
into the stage entrance.
In an instant he emerged, breathing
hard, heard the jeers of the crowd di
rected at the moving carriage, and.
his fingers clenching, rushed - into the
street antl 'gazed after it. It turned
Into Long Acre, going toward Picca
dilly. He plunged into the network of
side streets opposite and hastened rap
idly in the direction it had taken.
It was not far to the house on Pic
cadilly Terrace, and be outstripped the
coach. From the shadow he saw It
stop, saw the man it carried dis
mountâa.
"> "Where isYshe?" he muttered. 'He
took her from th. theater â damn him!
Where ha 3 he left her?" :
The same bitter smile with which hÂ«
had faced the clamor outside the thea
ter was on Gordon's white face as "he
entered the bouse. In the hat! he
opened a single note of invitation, read
It and laugned.
fiushton met him. "Mr. Dallas is in
the library, your lordship."
Gordon strode into the room. Dallas
saw that though he was smiling oddly,
his face. was deeply lined, and his eyes
, were glittering like those of a man
with a fever.
' "George," cried Dallas, "I was bound
to see you! Whyâ you are ill!"
"Not I, Dallas. I have been to Drury
Lane to-night. All society was there,
divorced and divorceable, intrigants
and Babylonians of quality. Lady Hol
land, like a hippopotamus in the face,
and William Lamb with the very man
' ncr of the ursine sloth!" '
s There was genuine anxiety in Dallas'
tone. "Come with me to Stratford for
'; a few days." he besought. "Come now
â to-night!" V
"Xot this week, old friend. I hayÂ»

tossed him the note he held. "See!

commanded, "and I shall not want you

The valet set the bottle down with an
anxious look at hi 3 masterâ a half-ap
pealing one toward Dallas.
As the door closed. Gordon, sitting on
the table-edge, began to sing with per

metallic; voice:

whose very fob-design was a thing of
more moment in Brookes' Club than
the fall of Bonaparte, and ,whtÂ»Â« losseven of the regent's - favor had not

a still fool that ran deep. â¢He had
been in debt ever since a prince's

Tenth Hussars: the episode now meant
to him only another ruined Jew, and
a fresh fisht for his Kashmerian but
terfly career.
Ke took sriiiff with nonchalant grace

each day in the year â touched his
rouged lips with a lace handkerchief of
royal rose-point. His prestige bad
never been hig-her. nor his insolence
more accurately applied than on this
evening of the last of the Dandy Balls.
The club tables, wnere oidinarilv
were grouped players at whist and
hazard, had vanished; brackets hold
ing glass candelabra were distributed
along the walls, and the pink shaded
glow of myriads of wax tapers was
reflected from mirrors set crosswise
in every angle and surrounded by
masses of flowers. The great tapes
tried-, ballroom â hundred feet in
lengthâ in which Madame Catalini
had given her famous concerts and
Kean his readings from Shakespeare,
was decorated with gilt columns, pi
lasters and classic medalions with
candles in cut glass lusters. A Ftring
orchestra played behind a screen or'
palms and a miniature stage had been
built across the lower end of the
room.
Here were gathered the oligarchs of
fashion and tne tyrants of ton. The
dandies â Pierrepont. Alvanley, Peter
j-ham. the fop lieutenants and poodle
loving rshipers of Brummell â with
gold buckles glittering in their
starched stocks, and brave in tight
German trousers and jeweled eye
glasses, preened and ogled among so
berer wearers of greater names and
ladies of title, whose glistening shoul
ders and bare arms flashed whitely
through the shifting stir of bright col
ors.
On the broad. stair, under the chan
deliers of crystal and silver, in the
ballroom â wherever the grroups and
the gossip moved that evening, one
name raa on every tongue. The se
ries of tableaux rehearsed under di
rection of Lady Heathcote. and the
new quadrille introduced from Paris
by Lady Jersey, the features of the
evening, were less speculated upou.
than was George Gordon. The hissing
at Drury Lane had several new ver-
Eions, aud there were more sensational
stories afloat. It was said he had en
tered Brookes' Club the day before,
where no one had spoken to him, that
the Horse Guards had had to be sent
for to prevent his being mobbed in
Palace Yard as he attempted to enter
the House of Lords. It was even con
fidently asserted that a motion was to
be introduced in Parliament to eus
pend him from his privileges as a
peer. :â .*â¢*â 
Lady Jersey, stately in black velvet
and creamy lace, met John Hobhouse
on the stair.
"Have you seen him?" she asked
anxiously.
"No, but I have called every day.
It was outrageous of you to send^him
the Invitation for to-night. No other
patroness would have dared."
"I only wish he would "came!" she
flashed imperiously. "One ould
think we were a lot of New England
witch hunters! There is nothing more
ridiculout than society in one of its
seven-year fits of morality. Scandals
are around us every day. but we pay
no heed till the spasm of outraged
virtue takes us. Then we pick out
some one by mere caprice, hiss him,
cut him â make a whipping-boy to be
lashed from our doors. When we are
satisfied we give our drastic virtue
chloroform and put it to sleep for an
other seven years!"
Hobhouse smiled grimly at the
gleam in her hazel eyes as she pass
ed on to the lower room, where the
quadrille v.as to have its final re
hearsal. Lady Jersey's was a despotic
rule. She ..was as famous for her dip
lomacy as for her Sunday parties.
More than one debate had been post
poned in Parliament to avoid a con-
J'.ict with one of her dinners. Gordon,
he reflected, could have no more pow
erful alls'.
He ascended to the ballroom,
where the tableaux were oozing pa
tiently on with transient . shes of ap
probation: "Solomon and the Queen of
Sheba," -with Lady Heathcote as the
queen; "Tamerlane the Great," posed
by a giant officer of the footguards in
a suit of chainmailâ and subjects
drawn from heathen mythology.
The last number, a monologue, was
unnamed, but word had gone fortb
that the performer was to be Lady
Caroline Lamb.
Slowly the curtain was drawn aside
and a breath of applause stirred as 1
Lady Caroline was revealed, in com
plete Greek cpstume, with short blue
skirt an<l round jacket, its bodice cut
EQuare and low and its sleeves white
from elbow to wrist. In that congress
of beauties, â¢ ked in the stilted con
ventions of Mayfair modistes, the at
tire had a touch of the barbaric which
suited its wearers type â a touch ac
centuated by #ie Jade beads about her
throat and the dagger thrust through
her girdle. .
The fiddles of the orchestra had be-
Kun to play, as prelude, the mv:- of
the Greek love-song Gordon had writ
ten, long ago made popular in London
drawing-rooms, and "Maid-of.-Athens!"
*'ts echo*Â£ here and there from the
floor.
The figure on the stage swept a slow
glance about her, her cheeks dark and
red from some under-excitement. She
waved her hand, and from the wings
came a procession of tiny pages dressed
â¢c imps, all in red.
A murmur of wonder broke from the
crowd. Lady Caroline's vaparies were
well known and her wayward devisings
were never without -'.ion.
"What foolery of CarVs can this
be?" queried Brummell to Petersham
as the first page et up a tripod and
the second placed upon it a huge metal
salver.
The whole room was rustling, for it
was clear, from the open surprise of
the committee, that this was a Jeature
not on the programme. Those in the
rear even stood on chairg while the
Bcarlet-hued Imps grouped about the
tripod in a half-circle open toward the
audience.
Lady Caroline clapped her hands and
a last page entered dressed In red ana
black as Mephistopheles, carrying alr>f<
on a wand what iooked like a gigantic
doll.' The wand he fitted into a socket
ir. the salver, and the dangling figure
that swung from it, turning slowly, re
vealed a grotesque image of George
Gordon.v,
The audience Razed at the ettfy with
It* clever burjesque of each well-known
dettilâ the op<Â»n rolling collar/the short
brown curls parted on the mask, the
carnation in Its buttonholeâ startled at
the effrontery â¢of the idea. it was
Brummell who gave the , signal by an
enthusiastic Brava!
! Then the assemblage broke into ap
plause and laughter that ran like a
, mounting wave- across the flash ana
plitter of -the ballroom,: thundering
down the refrain (if the orchestra.
The applause stilled aÂ« Lady Caro
line raised her hand, and recited, in a
voice that penetrated to the further
most corner:

John Hobhouse was staring, indig

note of triumph, more trenchant and
remorseless than her raillery, grew into
Lady Caroline's tone: V.

At the word "burn; 1 ! the speaker

brightly up- The imp-pages grasped
hands and began to run round and
round the group. At the v.eird sight
a tumult of applause went up from the
whole multitude, which clappad and
stamped and brava'd itself hoarse. â¢
Suddenly a stranpe thing happened â
unexpected, anomalous, uncanny. The
applause hushed as though a wet
b'ar.kft had befn thrown ever it. Faces
forsook the stage. The pages ceased
their circling. Women drew sharp
tremulous breaths and men turned
eagerly in their places to see a man
advancing into the assembly with halt
ing step and with a face pale yet bril
liant, like an alabaster vase lighted
from within-
Some subtle magnetism had always
hung about George Gordon, that had

by name; scores he had dined and
gamed with. His look, ruthless, yet
even, sc.med to single out and hold
each one of these speechless and star
ing, deaf to Brummell's sneer through
the <julet.
Speech came from Gordon's lips, con
trolled, yet vital with subterraneous
passion â words that none of that
shaken audience rould afterward re
call save i:i partâ hot like lava, writh
ing, pitiless, falling among them like
a flaying lash of whip-cords:

The livid sentences fell quivering,
heavy with virile emphasis, liVce the
defiance of some sat-red augur, in
vokius the furies in the ittldriigHt of
Ronje.
Hardly a breath of movement bad
come from those who heard. Thry
seemed struck with stupor ut the spec
tacle of this fiery drama of feeling.
Laiiy Caroline was still standing, the
center of the group of imp pages, '^^d
above her havered a slate-colored
cloud, the smoke from the effigy
crumbling into shapeless ash^s. Her
gaze was on the speaker; hei 1 te^th
clenched; the mockery of her face
merged into something apprehensive
and terror-smitton.
In the same strained silence, look
ing, neither to right nor left, Gordon
passed to the entrance. Hobhouse met
him half way and turned with him to
Lady Jersey. Gordon bent and kissed
her hand, and as he went slowly-. down
the stair Ludy Jersey's eyes filled with
tears.
This sDell was broken by a cry from
the stage and Lady Heathcote's
scream. Lady Caroline had swayed
and fallen. The blade of the dagger
which she still held had slipped against
her breast as she fell, and blood fol
lowed the slight cut. The crowd surged
forward in excitement and relaxation,
while waves of lively orchestral music
rolled over the confusion, through
which the crumpled figure %vaÂ» carried
to a dressing-room.
Only those near by saw the dagger
cut, but almost before Gordon had
emerged into the night a strange ru
mor was running through the assem
bly. It grew in volume through the
after-quadrllle and reached the street.
THE SAN FRANCIsfcO SUNDAY CALL.
"Caroline Lamb has tried to stab
herself," the whisper said.
CHAPTER XX.
The Exile.
Fletcher -was watching anxiously for
his master's return that night. When
he entered there were new lines in his
faceâ the stigmata of some abrupt and
fearful mental recoil.
"Order the coach to be got ready at
once," Gordon directed, "and pack my
portmanteau."
He went heavily into the library,
gazing at the bookshelves with eyes
listless and dull. Presently, with the
sume nerveless movements, he unlocked
a drawer and took therefrom several
small articles; a lock of Ada's hairâ
a little copy of "Romeo and Jullel"
given him years before, by his sister â
and the black bottle. He thrust these
into his great coat pocket.
Amid the litter of papers on his desk
a document met his eye; it was the
draft of separation submitted by Sir
' Samuel Romilly. Through his mind
flitted vaguely his struggle as he had
sat with that paper before him. The
struggle was ended; Justice was im
possible. It remained only to sign this,
the death-warrant of his fatherhood.
He wrote his name without a tremor,
franked it for the post and laid it in
plain view, as Fletcher entered to an
nounce the carriage.
The deep lines were deeper on Gor
don's face as he went to the pave
ment; he moved like a sleep-walker.
h's body obeying mechanically the
mandate of some hidden, alert purpose
Working independently of eye and
bruin. An inner voice rather than his
n-wn veeuiid to give the direction â a di
rectifln that made the coachman stare,
made Fletcher with v look of dismay
seise coat and hat and climb hurriedly
to^th" box beside him.
Cordon <!id not see this â he saw
nothing, knew nothing, save the rush
of the coach through the gloom.
When the worn night wan breaking
into purple fringes of dawn, Gordon
stood on the deck of a packet out
bound C<>r Ostend, looking back over
t|se wine-dark water where the dis
solving fog, hung like a fume of silver
gray against the white Dover cliffs,
built a glittering city of towers and
banners Under the llrst beams the
capric ious vapors seemed the ghosts of
dead ideals shrouding a harbor of hate.
His youth, his dreams, his triumphs,
his bitterness, hie rebellion, his grief,
all blended, lay there smarting, irre
parablel Before him stretched wander
inss and regrets and broken longings.
'"Your coffee, my lord!" â a familiar
voice spoke. Fletcher stood behind
him, tray in hand, trepidation and re
solve struggling in his countenance.
Gordon took the coffee mechanically.
"How did you come here?"
"With the coach, my lord"
"Where are you going?"
The valet's hand shook, and he swal
lowed hard. â¢'Your lordship knows
best," he said huskily.
Gordon cazed a moment out across
the misty channel. When he set down
the cup his face had a look that
brought to the other's eyes a sudden
gladness and utter devotion.
"Thank you, Fletcher," he said
gently, and turned his gaze away. '
Presently, as the light quickened, he
drew paper from his pocket, put the
copy of "Romeo and Juliet" beneath it
for support, and with the book resting
on the rail, began to write. What he
wroteâ strange that chance should have
furnished for his table now a story of
such deathless levelâ was a letter to
Annabel:
"A few final wordaâ not many. An
swer I do not expect, nor does it im
port. But you will at least hear me.
I leave in England but one being whom
you have left me to part withâ my
sister. Wherever I may goâ and I may
go far â you and I can never meet in
thia world. Let this fac| content or
atone, and if accident occurs to me, be
kind to her; or if she is then also noth
ing, to her children. For never has she
acted or spoken toward you but as
your friend. You once promised me
this much- Do not deem the promise
canceled â for it was not a vow.
"Whatever I may have felt, I assure
you that at this moment I bear you
no resentment. If you have injured
me, this forgiveness is something; if I
have injured you, it is something more
still. Remember that our feelings will
have one rallying point so long as our
child, lives. Teach Ada not to hate me.
I do not ask for justflcation to herâ
this is probably beyond the power of
either of us to giveâ but let her. not
grow up believing I am a deserving
outcast from my kind, or lying dead In
some forgotten grave. For the one
would sadden her young mind no less
than the other- Let her one day
read what I have written, and so judge
me. And recollect that though now it
may be an advantage to you, yet It
may some time come to be a sorro-w to
her to have the waters or the earth
between her and her falher.
"Whether the offense that has part
ed us has been solely on my side or
reciprocal, or on yours chiefly, I have
ceased now to reflect upon any but two
things â that you are the mother of my
child, and that we shall never meet
again."
CHAPTER .. IXXI.l XXI.
Gordon Swims for a Life.
From London to Ostend and through
Flanders a swart shadow trailed George
Gordon slowly but unerringly. It was
the man whose dark, reckless face had
once turned with jealous passion to
Jane Clermont hs they had watched a
carriage approaching Drury lane; he
vho, on a later night, had pursued the
same vehicle, then a mark for jeers,
to Piccadilly terrace. The question lie
had uttered as he saw Gordon alight
alone had rung in his brain . through
his after-search: "Where has he left
her?" The London newspapers had
not been long in chronicling Gordon's
arrival in Ostend, and thither he fol
lowed, making certain that in finding
one he should find the other.
The chase at first was not difficult.
Evil report, carried with malicious as
siduity by spying tourists and globe
trotting gr>3sip-mongers, had soou
overtaken his quarry and Gordon's
progress became marked by calumnious
tales which hovered like obscene sea
birds over the wake of a vessel. Gor
don had gone from Brussels in a huge
coach, copied from one of Napoleon's
taken at Jemappe, and purchased from
a traveling Wallachian nobleman. The
vehicle Mas a noteworthy object and
early formed the basis of lying reports.
A paragraph in the Journal de Bel
glque met the pursuer's eye on his
first arrival in Ostend.
It stated with detail that a Flemish
coachmaker had delivered to the milor
Anglois a coach of the value of 2800
francs; that on going for payment he
found his lordship had absconded with
the carriage; that the defrauded seller
had petitioned the Tribunal de Pre
miers Instance for proper representa
tion to other districts, that the fugi
tive might be apprehended and the
stolen property seized. With this clip
ping in his pocket the man who track
ed Gordon followed up the Khine to
the confines of Switzerland. Here he
lpst a month, for the emblazoned
wagon de luxe had turned at Basle,
and, skirting N'eufchatel, had taken its
course to Lake Geneva.
Gordon had traveled wholly at ran
dom and paused there only because
the shimmering blue waters, the black
mountain ridges with their epaulets of
cloud, and, In the distance, the cold,
secular phantom of Mont Bianc.
brought to his jaded senses the first
hint of relief. In the Villa Diodati.
high above the lake, the English mi
lord with the lame foot, the white
face and sparkling eyes stayed his
course, to the wonder of the country
folk who speculated endlessly upon the
strange choice which preferred the
gloomy villa to the spires and slate
roof of the gay city so near. And
here, to his surprise. Gordon found
ensconced, in a cottage on the high
bank, Shelley and his young wife, with
the black-eyed, creole-tinted girl
whom the Drury Lane audience had
hissed.
So had chance conspired to color
circumstance for the rage of tireless
hatred that was following.
The blows that had succeeded the
flight of Annabel with his child had
left Gordon stunned. The flaming re
coil of his feeling, in that fierce de
nunciation at Almack'e, had burned up
in him the very capacity for further
suffering, and for a time the quiet of
Diodati, set in its grove above the
â¢water like a bird's nest among leaves,
was a healing anodyne.
From his balcony Mont Blanc and
its snowy aiguilles were screened, but
the sun sank roseate behind the Jura,
and it lifted again over vineyarded
hills which echoed the songs of vine
dressers and the mellow bells of saun
tering herds. Below, boats swept idly
in the sun, or the long lances of the
rain marched and marshaled across
the level lake to the meeting and sun
dering of the clouds.
There came a time too soon, when
the dulled nerves awoke, when the
whole man cried out. In the sharpest
of these moods Gordon found respite
at the adjacent cottage, where Shelley,
whose bright eyes seemed to drink
light from the pages of Plato or Cal
deron, read aloud, or Jane Clermont,
piquant and daring as of old, sang for
them some songs of Tom Moore's. Or
in the long days the two men walked
and sailed, under a sky of garter-blue,
feeling the lapping of the waves, liv
ing between the two wondrous worlds
of water and ether, till for a time Gor
don laid the troubled specters of his
thought in semi-forgetfulness.
One day they drove along the mar
gin of the lake to Chlllon and spent a
night beneath the frowning chateau
â walls that had entombed Bonnivard.
On the afternoon of their re
turn, sitting alone on the bal
cony with the gloom of those
dungeons still upon him, gazing
far across the lake, across the moun
tains, toward that home from which
he had been driven, Gordon, for the
first time since he had left England,
found relief :n composition. He wrote
of Chillon's prisoner, but the agony in
the lines was a personal one:
I made a footing in the wall.
It was not therefrom to eÂ»cm.ps.
For I had buried one and all
Who loved me in a human shape;
Ko childâ no sireâ no kin had I.
No partner In my miisery;
But I was curicus to ascend
To my barred windows, and to bend
Once more, upon the mountains hÂ»Â«h,
ThÂ« quiet of a loving eye.
He wrote in the dimming luster of
a perfect day. Below him rippled the
long lake churning an Inarticulate mel
ody, and a tiny island with trees upon
It rested the eye. As he gazed, beyond
the dazzling beryl foliage, set in the
sunset, a spot riveted his look. A
moment before the white sail of a boat
had grlanced there! now a confused
flat blur lay on the water.
Gordon thrust his commonplace
book into his pocket and leaned for
ward, shading his eyes from the glow.
The blot resolved itself into a capsized
hull and two black figures struggling
in the water, one with difficulty sup
porting the other.
The next moment he was dashing
down the bank, hallooing for Fletcher,
peeling off coat and waistcoat as he
went.
"There's a boat swamped," he shout
ed, as the valet came through the gar
den. "Where is the skiff?"
"Miss Clermont has it. ray lord.*
Gordon plunged in, while Fletcher
ran to summon the Shelleys.
came hurrying along the vineyard lane
with frightened Tuces, Mary to watch
from the high bank, and Shelley, who
could no more swim than Fletcher, to
stride up and down, his long hair
streaming In the wind. The excitement
brought a picturesque dozen of goitred
vinedressers from the hillside, who
looked on with exclamations.
All were gazing fixedly on the lake,
or they might have seen two men enter
the grounds from the upper road. Of
these one was a Swiss with a severe,
thin face* and ascetic brow, the syndic
of Cologny, the nearest town â a bigot
functionary heartily disliked by the
country people. The other was a Ge
nevan attorney. From the road th*>y
had not seen the catastrophe, and the
overturned boat, the struggling figures,
and the swimmer forging to the rescue
came to their view all at once.
Gordon was swimming as he had
never done save onee â when he had
swum the Hellespont years before, and
In midchannel a strange, great pie
bald fish had glided near him. The
lawyer saw him reach and grasp the
helpless man and, supporting him,
bring him to shore. He sniffed with
satisfaction.
"Only one man In the canton can
swjm like that." he said, "and that's
the one you came to see. No won
der the peasants call him "the English
fish!' "
The young man whom Gordon had
aided wore a blonde curling beard,
contrasting strongly with his old
er companion's darker shaven
chr-eks and bushy black Greek eye
brows. The unseen spectators on
the terrace saw him drink from 1
his rescuer's pocket -flaskâ saw him
rise and grasp the other's hand and
knew that he was thanking him. As
they watched, a servant ran to the
coachhouse, and the syndic observed:
"He's sending them into town by car
riage. They're going indoors now.
WVU go down presently."
"Take my advice," urged the attor
ney abc-ve the terrace, "and let the
Englishman alone. Haven't we court
business enough in Switzerland, that
we must work far Flanders? What
have we to do with the complaints of
Brussels coachmakers? And how do
you know it's true, anyway?"
The syndic's lips snapped together.
"I know my business," he bridled.
"He is a worshiper u-f Satan and a
scoffer at religion."
And you'd burn him with green
wood if you could, as Calvin did Serve
tus irÂ» the town yonder, eh?"
"Ho has committed every orinie in his
own country," went on the other an
grily. "He has formed a conspiracy to
overthrow by rhyme all morals and
government. My brother wrote me
from Copet that on* of Madame dÂ»
Stael's guests fainted at seeing him

none such on her skirts. Let us go
down." he added, risin;; "it will be
dark soon."
The counselor shrugged his shoulders
and followed the other over th>3 sloping
terrace.
CHAPTKR XVII.
The Face on the Ivory.
When Gordon descended the stair he
came upon a striking group at the villa,
entrance. Shelley, with his ' wife be
side him, confronted the" severe-faced
syndic, who stood stolidly - with the
comft-rtabiy plump avocat. A look of
indignati. n was on his brow, and
Mary's face was perturbed.- . < "
.."Here he is." said the functionary in
his neighborhood patois, and with
satisfaction.
"You hive business with me?" asked
Gordon.
"I have. I require you to accompany
me at once to Cologny on a matte*
touching the peace of this canton."
"And this matter is what?"
"You speak French." returned the*
syndic tartly: ""doubtless you read it as
well" â and handed him a clipping from
the Journal de Belgique.
Gordon scanned the fragment of
paper, tirst with surprise, then with a
slow and bitter smile. He had not
seen the story, but it differed littlet
from scores of calumnies that had filled
the columns of less credulous news
papers in London before his departure.
It was a breath fresh from the eld
sulphur bed of hatred, brought sharply
to him here in his solitude.
"I see," he said; "this states that a
certain English milord had turned
highwayman and deprived an honest
Fleming of a wagon? How does it af
fect me?"
"Do you deny that you have tho
wagon?" demanded the syndic curtly.
"The wagon? I have a wagon, yes.
One bought for me by my servant."
"In Brussels?"
"As it happens, in Brussels." The
paleness of Gordon's face was ac
centuated now, and his eyes held cores
of dangerous flame. "And because I
am an English milord, and bring a
wagon from Brussels, you assume that
I am a robber?"
"You were driven from your own
country," menaced the other. "Do you
think we hear nothing, we Swiss? This
canWn knows you well enough! Stop
those horsea!" he snarled, for the great
coach, ready for Its trip to the town,
was rolling down the driveway. The
syndic sprang to the horses" heads.
At the same instant the two stran
gers who had been in the overturned
boat, now with clothing partially
dried, came from the house.
"There! ' The syndic pointed to the
ornate vehicle. "Do you deny this is
the wagon described in that newspa
per, and that you absconded with it
from Brussels?"
The older of the two strangers turned
quick eyes on Gordon, then on the
wagon. Before Gordon could reply he
spoke in nervous French:
"I beg pardon. I was the owner of
that conveyance, and the one who
it."
"Maybe. " said the functionary, "but
you did not sell it to this person, I
have reason to believe."
"No, yonder is the purchaser. He
pointed to c prosaic figure at tne steps.
"His valet." 1 Shelley thrust in explos
ively.
"I told you so," grunted the man of
law, and started with the surprise tÂ»f
recognition, as the syndic, ruffling
with anger, turned on the strangers
with sarcasm: "Friends of the English
milord, no doubt!"
The counselor laid a hasty hand on
his sleeve:
"Stop!" he said. "I think I have had
the honor of meeting: these gentlemen
in Geneva. Allow me t~> present you.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Walla -

younger companion â "his secretary.

The sour-fac^d official drew back.
These were names whose owner* had
been public guests of the canton. This
Englibh.nan, evil aul outcast as be
might be. he had n<> legal hold upon.
He could scarcely frame a grudging
apology, for the resentment of self
righteousness that was on his tonyue.
and stalked off up the terrace in sullen
chagrin, not consoled by the chuckles
of the attorney beside him.
Gordon saw them go, his hands
trembling:. He replied mechanically to
the grateful farewells of the two stran
gers as they : entered the coach, aud
â watched it roll swiftly, down the dark
ening shore road, a quivering blur bÂ«
fore his eyes. A fierce struggle - was
within him, the peace which the tran
quil poise of. Shelley's creed had lent
him, warring againat a clamant rage.
Not only .in England -was -h#
maligned. Here, on . the Â«" edge â¢; of
this 'â¢ mountain barrier, defamation
had followed him. The pair â '' rid
ing in his ; own carriage knew.--'who

and title. And they had not elected to
stay J beyond necessity. Yet for their
momentary presence, indeed, he should
be grateful. But for this trick . of; co

The Devil's Deal.
Ap he touk the two missives the girl
handed him Gordon caught his breath,
ne he saw was directed in Anna
nand. For a moment a hope that
<veiieai>ed all his suffering rose in his
brain. Had those months wrought a
i-hangf: jr. her.' Had she. too. thought
ot their child? Had the cry he voiced
<>n the packet that bore him from Eng
land struck an answering chord in
her? He opened its cover. An in
(U/sure droppetl out.
He picked it up blankly. It was the
note he had penciled on the channel,
returned unopened.
The sudden revulsion chilled him. He
broke the seal of the second letter and
readâ read while a look of utter *ick
whiteness crept across his face, a look
of rage and suffering that marked
cvrry feature.
It was from his sister, a letter writ
ten with fingers that soiled and creased
it in thefr agony, blotted and stained
with tears. For the thing it told of
was a dreadful thing, a whispered
charge against him so damning, so sa
tanic in itÂ« cruelty, that though lip
might murmur it to a gloating ear,
yet pen refused to word it. The whole
thing turned black before him, and
the dusk seemed shot through with
barbed and flaming javelins of agony.
He crushed the letter in his hand,
and. with a gesture like a madman s,
thrust it into Shelley's, turning to him
a countenance distorted with passion,
gauche, malignant, repulsive.
"Read it, Shelley," he said in a stran
gled voice. "Read it and know Lon
don, the most ineffable centaur ever
begotten of hypocrisy and a night
mare! Read what its wretched lepers
are saying:: There is a place in Michael
Anglo's "Last Judgment' in/ the Sietine
Chapel that was made for their kind,
and may the like await them in that
tif our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ â
Amen!"
With this fearful imprecation he
flung away from their startled faces
along the vineyard lane, on into the
dusk. l"gt to a sense of direction, to
everything save the blackness in his
own soul.
The night fell, odorous with grape
scents, and the moon stained the ter
races to amber. It shone on Gordon
as he sat by the little wharf where
the skiff rocked in the ripples, his oye
viewless, looking straight before him
across the lake.
For him there was no sanctuary in
time or in distance. The passage he
had read at Newstead Abbey in his
mother's open Bible, beside her body,
flashed through his mind: "And among
these nations shalt thou find no ease,
neither shall the sole of thy foot have
rest. ... In the morning thou shalt
say, Would God it were even! and at
even thou ehalt say. Would God it were
morning!" He had foundâ should find
no easr- nor rest: The captive of Chil
lon had been bound only with fetters of
iron to stone pillars. He was chained
wjth nery links of hate to the freezing
walls of the world's contumely!
Footsteps went along the shadowy
lane. Shelley's voice spoke: "He will
come back soon, and we must comfort
him if we can."
The word's came distinctly as the
footsteps died away.
A twig snapped. He looked around.
Jane Clermont stood near him, her
smiling into his, fringed with in
toxication and daring.
"I know." she said; "they are
hounding: you still. They hated me,
too."' She came quite close to him.
â What need we care? What are they
all to us?"
It was the Jane of the Drury Lane
greenroom he saw now â the Jane
Be brilliance and wit had held him
but there was something
deeper In her look than he had nver
seen before; a recklessness, an invi
tation and an assent.
"Jane!" he exclaimed.
She touched his hand. "Why should
â we stay here? Let us go away from
them all â where they cannot follow us
to sting:"
Gordon stared at her, his eyes hold
ing hers. To go away â with her? To
Blip the leash of all that was pagan in
him? What matter? He was damned
anywayâ a social pariah; why strive
to undeserve the reputation .' His
thought was swirling through savage
undercurrents of vindictive wrath,
circling, circling like a maelstrom,
about this one dead center: Civiliza
tion had cast him off. Henceforth his
life was his own, to live to himself, for
his own ends, as the savage, as the
beast of the field. To live and to die,
knowing that no greater agony that
was meted to h'm now could await
him, even in that nethermost reach
where the lost are driven at the end.
"We must comfort him if we can!"
The words Shelley had spoken
seemed to vibrate in the stillness like
the caught key of an organ. He
turned to where- Villa Diodati above
them slept in the long arms of the
night shadows, listening to \he con
tending voices within him. Comfort?
The placid comfort of philosophy for
him whose flesh was fever and his
blood quicksilver? In this girl life
and action beckoned to him â life full
and abundant â forgetful ness, wtfn
dering and pleasure, fleeting surely,
but still his while it should last! And
yet â
The girl's hand was on the skiff. On
a sudden a cry of fear burst from her
lips and she shrank back as a
disordered figure broke from the
darkness and clutched Gordon's arm.
fiercely.
"Where are you taking her now?"
Gordon's thought veered. In his
numbness of feeling there scarce
Eeemed strangeness In the apparition.
As he looked at the Oriental, mus
tachioed face, haggard and haunted,
his lips rather than his mind replied:
"Who knows?"
"You lie! You ruined her career
and stole her away from London and
from me! Now you want to take her
from these last friends of hers â for
yourself! But you cannot go where
I will not find you! And where you
go the world shall know and despise
you!"
Jane's eyes flashed upon the speak

ous anger. "You hated him even in
London: now you have followed him
here. It is you who have set the
peasants to spy upon us! It is you
who have spread tales through Gen
eva! You whose lies sent the syndic
to-day!"
Gordon had been staring at the
Moorish, theatric face with a gaze of
singular inquiry, his brain searching,
searching for a lost clew. All at once
the haze lightened. His thoughts
leaped across a chasm of time. He

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
"Teresa." Gordon suddenly remem
bered the name perfectly. With the
memory mixed a sardonic reflection;
the man who had lost the miniature
that day in Switzerland had hastened
away <-with clothing scarcely dried.
Well, if that brother had deemed him
self too good to linger with the outcast,
the balance had been squared. The
sister, perforce, had made a longer
stay!
Holding it, he walked to a folded
mirror in a corner of the wall and
opened its panels. There had been a
time when he had said no appetite
should ever rule him; the face he saw
reflected now wore the lines of in
corrigible self-indulgence, animalism,
the sinister badge of the bacchanal.
"Is that> you, George Gordon?" he
asked.
The ghosts dreÂ»' nearer. They peered
over his shoulders. He felt their
grasping at him. He cursed them. By
what right did they follow him? By
what damnable chance, ruled by is'hat
Infernal jugglery, came this painted
semblance to open old tombs? Some
thing had awakened in him â it was the
side that recollected, remorseless and
impenitent, but no longer benumbed,
writhing with smarting vitality.
Awake, it recoiled abashed from the
voiceless vade retro of that symbol.
What part had lie in that pur
ity whose visible emblem mocked
and derided him? What comrade
ship did life hold for him save
the hideous Gorgon of memory, the
Cerberus of ill fame, spirits of the
dark, garish fellows of the half-worldâ
"they whose steps go down to hell!"
A fury, demoniac, terrible, fell on
him. He seized the miniature, dashed
it on the floor, stamped it with his heel
and crushed and ground it into indls
guishable fragments.
Then he sprang. up. and with an oath
â whose note was echoed by the tame
raven croaking on. the landing rushed
down the stairway and threw himself
into his gondola.
The moon rose red as a house afire.
Before it paled, he had passed the la
goon. In the dim light that presaged
the sodden dawn he leaped ashore on
the mainland, pierced the damp laurel
thickets that skirted the river Brenta
and plunged into the forest.
CHAPTER XXV.
Teresa Meets a Stranger.
Through the twittering dawn, with
its multitudinous damp scents, its
stubble fields of maize glimpsed
through the stripped ilex trees, whose
twigs scrawled black hieroglyphics on
the hueless sky. Gordon strode sharply,
heedless of direction.
The convulsion of rage with which
he hid destroyed the miniature had
finished the work the latter's advent
had begun. The nerve, stirring from
its opiate sleep to a consciousness of
dull pain, had jarred itself to agony.
His mind was awake, but the wind
had swept saltly through the coverts
of his passion, and their denizens
crouched shivering.
The sight of a dove-tinted villa
guarded by cypress spears â a gray
gathering of cupolasâ told him he had
walked about two miles. This was
La Mira, one of the estates of the
Countess Albrizzi, a great name in
Venice. He turned aside into the de
serted olive grove above the river. A
slim walk meandered here, thick with
dead leaves, with a cleared slope
stretching down to where the deep-eyed
Brenta twisted like a drenched ribbon
on its way to the salt marshes. Front
ing this breach, Gordon came
abruptly upon a wooden shrine, with a
weather-fretted prayer bench.
He stopped, regarding it half-ab
sently, his surcharged thought rear
ranging disi/sed images out of some
dusty speculative storehouse. A more
magnificent shrine rose on every campo
of Venice. They stood for a priestly
hierarchy, an elaborate clericalism â
the mullioned worship that to his life
seemed only the variform expression
of the futile earth-want, the satiric
hallucination of finite and mortal brain
that grasped at immortality and the
infinite. This, set in the isolation of
the place, seemed a symbol of more
primitive faith and prayer, of religion
rough-hewn, shorn of its formal acces
sories.
He went a step nearer, seeing a small
book lying beside the prayer bench. He
picked it up. It was a reprint in Eng
lish of his own "Prisoner of Chlllon,"
from a local press in Padua.
A sense of incongruity smote him. It
was the poem he had composed in
Geneva. He readily surmised that it
was through Shelley the verses had
reached his publisher in England, to
meet his eye a year afterward, in a
foreign dress, In an Italian forest.
He turned the pages curiously, con
ning the scarce remembered stanzas.
Could he himself have created them?
The instant wonder passed, blotted out
by lines he saw penned on the fly-leaf â
lines that he read with a tightening at
his heart and an electric-like rush of
strange sensations such as he had
never felt. For what was written
there, in the delicate tracery of a fem
inine hand, and in phrases simple and
pure as only the secret heart of a girl
could have framed them, was a prayer:
"Oh, my God! Graciously hear me.
I take encouragement from the assur
ance of Thy word to pray to Thee in
behalf of the author of this book which
has so pleased me. Thou desirest not
tJie death of a sinner â save, therefore,
him whom Venice calls ,'the wicked
milord.' Thou, who by sin art offended
and by penance satisfied, give to him
the desire to return to the good and to
glorify the talents Thou has so richly

about this notebook it might have led

But all I heard pointed in the one di

skill in the use of the harpoon, the rum

the initials 'P. C.'mpon the pouch were

no pipe was found in his cabin. You
remember that I asked whether whisky
and brandy were in the cabin. You

"And how did you find him?"
"My dear sir, the problem had be

"Oh blessed Virgin, Queen of the
most holy Rosary! Intercede and ob
tain for me of thy Son our Lord this
grace! Amen."
A step fell behind him. He turned
half-dazed, his mind full of conflict.
A girl stood near him, delicate and
alert and wand-like as a golden wil
low, her curling amber hair loosely
caught, her sea-blue eyes wide and a
little startled. She wore a Venetian
hood, out of whose green sheath her
face looked, like lilies under leaves.
Gordon's mir.d came back to the pres
ent time and space across an illimita
ble distance.
He stared, half believing himself in
some automatic hallucination. There
had been no time to speculate upon
what manner of hand had written
those words, what manner of woman's
soul had so weirdly touched his own
out of the void. Knowledge came stag
geringly. Hers was the face of the
miniature that his heel had crushed
to powder.
He noted that her eyes had fallen to
the book in his hand, as mechanically
he asked, in Italian:
"This book is yours, Signorina?"
"Yes." There was a faint flush of
color in her cheek, for she saw the
vulum* was open at the written page.
"If there be an ear which is open to
human appeal," he added gently, "that
prayer was registered, I know!"
"If there be!" Her thought stirred
protestlngly. "Ah, Signore, surely
there is. some one who hears! How
could one live and pray otherwise?"
The girl caught the mixed feeling in
*his face. He was not Italian â his ac
cent had told her that. He was an
Englishman, too, perhaps. "Do you
know him, Signore?"
His head turned quickly toward her.
In truth, had he ever really known
himself? "Yes," he answered after a
pause. "I know him, Signorinaâ far
better than most of the world."
She hesitated, opening and closing
the book in her hands.
"Is he all- they say of him?"
"Who knows, SignoTina?"
It was an involuntary exclamation
that sounded like acquiescence. The
Dili's face fell. In her thought, the man
of her dreaming, lacking an open ad
vocate, had gained the secret one of
sympathy. Was it all true then? Her
voice faltered a little.
"I have not believed, Signore, that
with a heart all evil one could write â
so!"
Into the raw blend of tangent emo
tions which were enwrapping Gordon,
had entered, as she spoke, another
well-defined. Never in his life, for his
own sake, had he cared whether one
or many believed truth or 11Â«Â» of him.
But now there thrilled in him, new
born, a desire that this slight girl
should not judge him as did the world.
The feeling lent his words a curious
energy:
"Many tales are told, Signorina, that
are true â some that are false. If he
were here â and I speak from certain
knov/ledge of him â he would not wish
me to extenuate; least of all to you
who have written what is on that leaf.
Perhaps that has been one of his faults,
that he has never justified himself. By
common report he has committed all
crimes, Signorina. He has thought it
useless to deny, since slander is not
guilt, nor is denial innocence, and since
neither good nor bad report could
lighten or add to his wretchedness."
The tint of her clear eyes deepened.
"I knew he was wretched. Signore! It
was fojfc. that reason I left the prayer
here overnight before Our Lady of Sor
rows â because I have heard he is an
outcast from his own country and his
own people. And then, because of
this." She touched the volume. "Ah,
I have read iittle of all he has written
âthis is the only poem â for I read his
English tongue so poorly; but in this
his heart speaks, Signore. It speaks of
pain and suffering and bondage. It
was not only the long-ago prisoner he
sang of; it was himself! himself! I
felt it â here, like a hurt."
She had spoken rapidly, stumblingly,
and ended with a hand pressed on her
heart. Her own feeling, as she sud
denly became aware of her vehemence,
startled her, and she half turned away,
hc-r lips trembling.
A softer light suffused her cheek.
His- pain-engraved face brought . a
mist to her eyes. She was a
child of the sun, with blood
leaping to quick response and a heart
a well of undiscovered impulses.- The
wicked milord's form lost distinction
and faded. Here was a being mysteri
ous, wretched, too, and alone â not In
tangible as was he of the Palazzo
Mocenigo, but beside her, speaking
with a voice which thrilled every nerve
of her sensitive nature. Unconsciously
she drew closer to him. x-
At that moment a call came under
the bare boughs: "Teresa! Teresa!"
She drew back. "It is La Contessa,"
she said; "I must hasten," and started
quickly through the trees.
His voice overtook her. "Signorina!"
The word vibrated. "Will you give me
the prayer?" He had come toward
her as she stopped. "There is a charm
in such things, perhaps."
The voice called again, and more
impatiently: "Teresa!"
She opened the book and tore out
the leaf with uncertain fingers. As he
took it his hand met hers. He bent his
head and toutihed It with his lips.
She flushed deeply, then turned and

ran through the naked trees toward
the villa shielded in its cypress rows.
The. girl ran breathlessly to the ter
race, where a lady leaned from a win
dow with a gently chiding tongue:
"Do they teach you to do wholly
without sleep in convents?" she cried.
"Do you not know your father and
Count Guhjcioli, your lord and master
to be, are to arrive to-day from Raven
na? You will be wilted before the

The sirl entered the house.
Under the olive wood a man. strange
ly moved, a rustling paper still in his
hand, walked back with quick strides
to his gondola, striving to exorcise a
chuckling fiend within him. who, with
mocking and malignant emphasis, kept
repeating:
"Oh, blessed Virgin, Queen of the
most holy Rosary! Intercede and ob
tain for me, of Thy Son our Lord, this
grace!"
CHAPTER XXVI.
A Woman of Fire and Dreams.
From the moment those lips touched
her hand in that meeting at the wood
shrine Teresa Gamba felt her life un
fold to rose-veined visions.
Her unmothered childhood and tHe
placid convent school years at Bag
nacavallo, near Ravenna, had known
no mystery other than her day-dreams
had fashioned. She had dreamed much:
it the time when she should marry and
redeem the fortunes of her house,
which, despite untainted blood and
ancient provincial name, was impover
ished; of the freedom of Italy, the sole
topic, aside from his endless chemical
experiments, of which her father, now
growing feeble, never tired; of her elder
brother, away in Wallachia, secretary
to trrte Greek Prince Mavrocordato; of
the few books she read, and the fewer
people she met. But these dreams had
not oossessed the charm of novelty.
Even when, at eighteen, through fam
ily friendship, she became a member
jf the Albrizzi household and ex
changed the dull convent walls for the
garlanded La Mira â even with those
rare days when she saw the gay splen
dor of Venice from a enrtained gondola
âeven then her mental life suffered
small change.
The marriage arranged for her with
Count Guiccioli, the oldest and richest
nobleman of Ravenna, a miser and
twice a widower, had aroused an inter
est in her mind scarce greater than
had the tales pi the Englishman of
the Palazzo Mocenigo. Such marriages
were of common occurrence in the life
she knew: the "wicked milord" was a
stranger thing â one to speculate more
endlessly upon.
But that meeting in the wood had
turned the course of her imaginings.
"A/wanderer â like him"; the words had
bridged the chasm between the dream
ing and the real. The secret thought
given to the "wicked milord" found
itslf absorbed by a nearer object. 'The
palazzo on the Grand Canal grew more
remote, and the stranger she had seen
stepped at a single stride into a place
her mind had already prepared.
The blush with which she had taken
the book from Gordon's hand was one
of mere self-consciousness; the vivid,
burning color which overspread her
face as she ran back through the trees
was something very different. It was
a part of her throbbing heart, of. the
tremulous confusion that overran her
whole body, called into life by the
touch of those palely carved lips upon
her fingers. His colorless face â a face
with the outline of the Apollo Belve
dere â the gray magnetic eyes, the
words he had said and their accent of
sadness, all were full of suggestive
misery. Why was he a wanderer â like
that other? Not for a kindred reason,
surely! He could not be evil also!
Rather It must have been because of
some loss, some hurt of love which
time might remedy.
Her agile fancy constructed more
than one hypothesis, spun more than
one romance, all of like ending. A new
love would heal his heart. Some time
he would look into a woman's eyes â
not as he had looked into hers; some
one would feel his lips â not as he had
kissed her hand. She in the meantime
would be no longer* a girl; she would
be the Contessa Guiccioli, with a
palazzo of her own in Ravenna, andâ
a husband.
But, somehow, this reflection brought
no satisfaction. The old Count she
had seen more than once driving by
in state when she played as a ehtld in
the convent woods; and that he with
his riches shouH desire her, had given
her father great pride, which was re
flected in her. Her suitor had brought
his age and ailments to La Mira on the
very day she had met the stranger at
the shrineâ the day her heart had beat
so oddly â and wjth his arrival, her
marriage had projected itself out of
the hazy future and become a dire
thing of the present. She felt a fresh
distaste of his sharp yellow eyes, his
cracked laugh. His eighty wiry years
seemed as many centuries. She be
came moody, put her father off and
took refuge in whims. The Contessa
advised the ctty, and the week's end
saw the Albrizzi palazzo thrown open.
In Venice, Teresa's spirits rose. She
loved to watch the bright little shops
opening, like morning-glories, the sky
fariiio: pigeons a silver quiver of wings;
to lie in the gondola waiting while her
father drank his brandy at the piaz
zcta caffe; to buy figs from little lame
Pasquale, who watched for her at a
shop-door in a narrow calle near at
hand; to see the gaudy flotillas of the
carnival, and the wedding processions,
fresh from the church, crossing the la
goon to leave their gifts at the various
island-convents; or, propelled by Tita's
swinging oar, to glide slowly in the
purpling sunset shadows, by the Piazza
San Marco, around red-towered San
Glorario, and so home again on color
soaked canals in the gleaming ruby of
the afterglow, through a city bub
bling with Ivory domes and glistening
like an opal's heart under its tiara of
towers.
She scarcely told the secret to her
own heart â that It was one face she
looked to see, one mysterious stranger
whose image haunted every campo,
every balcony and every bridge. Sho
flushed whenever she thought of that
kiss on her fingers; in the daytime she
felt it there like a sentient thing; at
night when she woke, her hand burned
her cheek.
Who was he? Why had he asked her
for the prayer? What had he done
with it? Was he still in Venice? Should
she see him again? She wondered, as,
parting the gondola tenda, she watched
her father cross the pave for his cog
nac.
"Are there many English in Venice,
Tita?"
The gondolier, lounging like a bril
liant-hued lizard, shrugged his shoul
ders. "BelliÃsima, there are hundreds
in the season. They come and go. They
are all lasagnoni, these Englishmen!"
Teresa's sigh checked itself. Tita
suddenly turned his head. Across the
piazetta a crowd was gather!^ It
centered before the shop at whose front
the five-year-old fig-seller was set to
watch for her.
"He fell from the scaffolding:' 1 said
a voice.
'If it should be little Pasquale!"
cried Teresa, and springing out,' ran
quickly forward. Tita waited to se
cure the gondola before he followed her.
A sad accident had happened. Be
fore the calle a platform had been
erected from which spectators might
watch the flotillas of the carnival.
Little Pasquale's delight was a tame
sparrow, whose name was a wicker
cage, and climbing to sun his pet when
he had been left to tend the empty
shop, the child slipped and fallen to the
pavement.
Teresa broke through the circle of
bystanders and knelt by the tumbled
little body, looking at the tiny face now
so waxen. The neighbors thronged
about, stupefied and hindering. A wo
man ran to fetch the mother, gossiping
with a neighbor. Another called loud
ly for a priest.
The girl, looking up, was bewildered
by the tumult. 'He must be got in."
she murmured, half helplessly, for the
people ringed them round.
A voice answered close beside her:
"I will carry him, Signorina" â and a
form she knew bent beside her, and
very geqtly lifted the small bundle in
his arms.
Teresa's heart bounded. Through
these days she had longed to hear that
voice again how vainly: Now in this
moment she was brought suddenly
close to him. tine ceased to hear the
sounds about her â saw only him. She
sprang up and led the way through
the press, down the close damp calle
and to the shop where the child lived.
"Dog of the Virgin: He need touch
no finger to child of mine!" sv.ore a
carpenter from the adjoining campo.
'Nor mine!"
"Why didn't you carry htm in your
self then?" growled Giuseppe, the fruit
vender. "Standing there like a bronze
pig! What have you against the Eng
lishman? Didn't he buy your brother
in-law a new gondola when the piling
smashed it 1"
"Scellerato!" sneered the carpenter.
"Why is his face so white? Like a po
tato sprout in a cellar! He is so evil
he fears the sun!"
The fruit vender turned away dis
dainfully. His foot kicked a shapeless
wicker object â it was little Pasquale's
cage smashed Hat. The sparrow inside
was gasping. He picked up the cage
and carried it to the shop.
In the inner, ill-lighted room, Gordon
laid the child on a couch. He had
spoken no further word to Teresa. At
the first sight of her, kneeling in the
street, he had started visibly as he had
done in the forest of La Mira when he
recognized her face as that of the min
iature. Now he was feeling her pres
ence beside him with a curious thrill
not unlike her own â a pleasure deeply
mixed with pain that almost a physical
pang.
Since that dawn walk above the
plane-treed Brenta he had been tread
ing strange ways. In the hours that
followed, remorse had been born in.
him. And as the first indrawn breath
racks the half-drowned body with
agony greater than that of the death,
it has already tasted, so the man had
suffered. During a fortnight, words
written on a sheet of paper that he
carried in his pocket had rung through
his brain. Day after day, as he sat in
his -gloomy palazzo, he had heard
them; night after night they had float
ed with him as his gondola bore him
through the waterways ringing with,
the estro of the carnival. To escape
them he had fled again and again to
the black phial, but when he awok^
the pain was still with him. instinct
and unrenounceable. It was more
acute at this moment than it had ever
been.
Teresa scarcely noted the fruit ven
der as he put the battered cage into
her hand just before its feathered oc
cupant breathed its last. Her look,
fixed on Gordon, was still eloquent
with the surprise. She saw the same
pale face, the same deep eyes, the
same chiseled curve of lips. His voice,
too. as he dispatched the kind-hearted
Giuseppe for a surgeon on the Riva,
had the same cadence of sadness. She
had noticed that his step halted as he
walked, as though from weakness.
And surely there was illness in his
face, too! Had there been any tender
hands near himâ as tender as those
with which he now examined the un
conscious child?
As Gordon bent above him little Pas
quale opened his eyes. His gaze fell
first not on the man or on Teresa, but
on the broken cage beside him. where
the bird lay still, one claw standing
stiffly upright. He tried to lift his
head, and called the sparrow's name.
.There was no answering chirp. The
claw was very still.
Then little Pasquale saw the Jaces
about him and knew what had hap
pened.
"He's dead!" he shrilled, and burst
into tears.
CHAPTER XXVTL
The EyII Eye.
Tears, too, had rushed to Teresa's
eyes, with a sweet glad sense of some
thing not akin to grief. Her hand on
the couch in the semi-darkness touch
ed another and she drew it away,
trembling.
Suddenly a wail came from tha calle,
a hurried step crossed the shop floor,
and the slattern mother burst into the
room. Close behind followed Tlta,
who. seeing his mistress, blocked the
inner door with his huge frame against
the curious, with whom the place now
overflowed.
The weeping woman had thrown
herself beside the couch where the
child lay. his eyes closed again. All
at once she saw 'the man who stood
before her, and. to Teresa's astonish
ment, sprang up and spat out coarse
imprecations.
"The evil eye!" she screamed. "Take
the Inglese away and fetch some holy
water! He has the evil eye!"
Teresa saw the spasm of pain that
crossed the colorless face. "No, no!"
she cried.
"What did I say!" sneered the car
penter.
Tita's great hand took him by the
throat. "Silence, devout jellyfish!" he
said, "or I crack your skull. Didn't
you hear the Signorina?"
'The evil eye.!" wailed the woman,
flinging back inky hair from her
brows. "He looked at the heart of my
life or he would not have fallen!"
"For shame!" protested Teresa in
dignantly. "He who carried him In
his own arms! Ah. do not listen:"
She turned to Gordon appealingly.
"She is mad to say such things! Let
us go," she added hastily, as murmurs
swelled from the shop. "We can do
no more!"
"Go, son of the Black One!" scream
ed the woman. "Go before my child
dies!"

OF ALL the odd fads that have
reached , ' New York via London,
the : latest captures the palm.'
What, do you i think miladt is
presenting her ; true .; love with â¢ now
adays? A miniature of her beautiful
eyesâ eye, : rather, for only one eye is
pictured. 1 The fad;: is just' now raging
in London, and a few smart New York
women.: just over, from a season ,in the
world's metropolis, : brought ; the ' fad
â¢ with , them. The Duchess of 'Manchester;
"is one of them. â ; . ; â  v - ; "â ''â¢"â â 
Those eye miniatures are not really
a i new invention of the ; novelty artist.
They were quite popular in the days
of gay King George arid . Mrs. ' Fitz
herbert was the one who introduced
the fashion. That beautiful , woman,
the wife sub rosa of the King, desired
to present, her royal i lover with a sou
venir of herself that would ; be abso
lutely/unique. Therefore she had a fa
mous French, miniaturist . paint a pic
ture.of one of her eyes, which she had
â¢ framed in Jewels, and delighted his
Majesty with the original gift. Other
beauties of the day took up the fad.
and the miniaturists were kept' busy
â  transferring blue, black, brown or. gray
eyes to ivory. Artists have painted
black eyes many a time, but this was
the first . instance on record >of an eye
being the subject of ; a. miniature. .
The London fad â¢' is merely ; a revival
of that old fashion -unearthed, by Ms.
Fitzherbert. Women ,of the Â smart set
had been pictured in numberless poses,
their hands and feet had been modeled
in plaster and marble, and they looked
about for some. new way of exploiting
$heir beauty features. They found it
in the eye miniature. The Duchess of
Marlborough, Countess of Rosslyri, and
others of the younger society, set were,
of course, leaders in introducing the
i eye miniatures, but the â  smaller fry
immediately followed. > â¢
Now that thÂ« fad has hit Gotham
Inside of a year â the way fashions
travel -it should, be raging ', in San
Francisco. Of course the photog
raphers will take it up, and eye photon
as well as miniatures will be 'possible.
The frames, Jeweled or merely of gold
or silver, will be another item. If every
man cannot write a sonnet. to his mis
press' eyebrow, he can at least present
lier with a photo of his best orb.
There is always a "best" eye, or
"better," if . one would be strictly

Then there are the eyebrows, which
have their significance In character
an,) emotion. Pliny wild that a por
tion of the SOU] must dwell there, and
Herder, the German historian, called
the arched eyebrow the rainbow of
peace; when contracted, the strung
bow of strife. They should be mod
erately thick and taper to a point In
Boft, Bllken hairs. According to Goethe,
a sensuous nature Is Indicated by
meeting brown. The Turks and
Moors consider this "perpetual frown"
a beauty.
Eyebrows are not necessarily a part
of the eye miniature, but eyelids and
lashes are. Half-closed lids are sig
nificant of Indulgence and are a great
"give-away" in an eye picture. Dark
circles under the eyes are by the Par
isian demi-mqndalnes considered a
beauty and they cultivate, them to
make themselves of an effrenee ap
pearance, but the bud of 20 or 1 less
would not like to see her eye minia
ture with one of these borders.
The white of the eye should be pure
nnd pearly, which in the fashionable
devotee of the cigarette . It never is.
"Pink eyes" and "red eyes" would be
tabu to the eye miniaturist. The eye
that gives way to grief Is never love
â"beauty's canker," the celebrated
.Venetian Cornard called grief.
The idea of the eye miniature Is
that a woman's lover or husband
would like to preserve something of
hid darling that is distinctive of her.
."What could be more so than her eye,
unlike anybody else's eye? It is not
always the large eyes that are most
â¢repressive, and therefore the best
subjects, for an eye miniaturist.' Marie
Tempest is said to possess the smallest
Â«>es of any actress, on the modern
ctage. but her eyes are so full of life
and expression that they place in the
shade more beautiful orbs from the
artist's viewpoint. Cissy Fitzgerald's
eyes were not remarkable for size, but
who could ever forget Cissy's wink?
A miniature of that wink, with or
without a jeweled frame, would be
priceless. No other woman has eyes
quite so exquisitely cerulean blue as
those of Lillian' Russell. Nobody
could mistake the twinkling orbs of
May Irwin . for those 'of another
blonde. That is why the eye -minia
ture promises to be a fad that will not
die no quickly as have other society
freaks and follies. There is something
charming in the possession of one of
these picturesâ the eye- of. a , wife,
sweetheart or friend, husband or lov
er. When llt reaches our city, the
home/of beautiful eyes, there is no
danger that it will not.be popular. So
many of our society women have eyes
as lovely as those of Elizabeth Wood
son, the little Southern actress, that
they will haste to place their perfect
orbs on ivory, or to have 5 them "pho
togranhed ''for' future reference." * "

there had been 'â 'â â > ioy in the light of '
the days since he had made that dash
from prison* Itta the odten. five days
ago. Five days'. And in aH that time
he had covered only f'jrty miles. Still
those forty milts had put half a moun
tain ran^e tweesa him and his pur
vnenC .h- could do better nuiv. jHe
tKlanctd cown at the very decent suit
tjt clothes ihat he had cLule:i trum the
miner's cabin in ieer Creek Valley the
night before, and he grimly lauKhcd "
bl the thought of how in-actical v re
venue he haa LaJctn on the man who
vould have betrayed him.
The miner, a tail, gaunt Cornishman,
had taken him In grudgingly, and in the
niti hour Huughtoii nad seen su:*>icion
light it&cif in his Uoai eyes. Silent
himself, he could not bear silence in
another, and Gerald iiousrhton had had
nothing to say. one crafty lead after
another had been ihiov.n, out. but
Houghton had warily eluded them ull.
.The miner finally abandoned his ef
foits. but his somber, su^iiicious eyes
were frequently lifted from the much
woni Bible behind vhioh he had re
tired, and Houphton found it easy to
fcum:i?e that ><v. 1 the scriptural text
the eyes were seeing a placard which
had been posted far and wide:
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS RE
WARD FOU THE ARREST OF ANY
ONE OP THE CONVICTS WHO
ESCAPED"â and so on, every minute
detail of description pitilessly clear.
How far would his few poor chances
' serve him?
Houghton sat cursing the luck that
had led him to select this cabin, of
all others; a little knot of raesred
shanties trailed out along the bend of
the river, forming a dreary, lost-look
ing little settlement. A settlement of.
any sort was an unexpected find in
that unpromising regfon. and Houghton
had lost no time in clamberine down
the mountain side to ask for /ood and
lodging at one of the dwellings. Small
choice there had been amonc them; in
one a noisy group wrangled over a
card game; from another came the cry
of a little sirk child: and at the door of
enother a wan-eyed woman sat. her
graze never lifted from the narrow band
of misty moonlight that meant the trail
to town. Finally his choice had fallen
upon the last one, detached from the
others, and thus he had fallen into the
hands of the suspicious Cornlshman.
He gave no sign that he was aware
of his host's suspicions, but when,
shortly after they had retired, the
miner cjuietly stole out. Houghton
guessed his errand' only too well. He
â¢ rose, arid in response to a swiftly
forming habit, looked about for some
thing that might be of service to him
In his flight. - A suit of clothing, evi
dertiy the miner's best, hung care
fully covered in a corner. With a grim
sense of its owner's probable chag
rin. Houghton hastily dressed himself
* In the neat, well-brushed suit, left tho
cabin and struck out along the trail
of, the so-called town. The furious
rage of the hunted had abated, and
r.t>w he was able to plan with a certain
degree of CAlmness.
The miner had preceded him by
only a few hundred' rods; Houghton
figured that he would have time, after
the rough-four-mile tramp, for a lit
tle much-needed rsst and yet be sure
of reaching the railroad before the
authorities, summoned by the miner
to the Deer Creek cabin, could notify
any one to head him off. The trail
.followed the river, running at right
angles to the railroad; there would
surely be a water tank where the rail
road and river met; that was the
chance upon which Houghton was
counting. It was only a chance;
m Houghton's knowledge of engineering
told him that many other devices were
possible, but his judgment argued that
that would be the probable one. The
train would stop and it would be easy
for him to get aboard. A hundred
miles by rail, and he could laugh at
. all attempts to find him.
Bo far all was well, though the all
night life of the mining town had in
terfered, to a certain extent, with his
clumbers. The jangling pianos, the
sorrowful vio'.ln, the shuffling of feet
Â«nd the wild choruses of tuneless
voices cast a spirit of unrest over him
es he slept, curled up In a: convenient
loft. The feeling was with him when
he awoke, and it deepened as he
looked out upon the hopeless gray of
the new day. If only the sunâ
Houghton pulled himself together
sharply; there was plenty of sunshine
a. hundred miles to the south. Three
hours, four, â of this depressing
irrayness â what did It signify? He
would have a chance t o begin again

lurched ' heavily

along just ahead
of him as Hough
ton struck out for
the railroad.
"But don't you

It was a wom

Houghton started
â it sounded so
near.
"Tha's all roight; â¢

The words came
from the man
ahead, and Hough
ton, overtaking
him with swift
strides, could see
that a woman
clung to the lurch
ing figure; a little
â woman, whose
thin, plaintive
tones suggested
weakness and ex
treme fatigue.
"Davie, dear."
came the woman's
voice again,

half* the night to
get ye to come home; and I had to
come all alone because Jem wasn't in
the house when I went â Oh, Davie!"
"I'm goln* home; 'course I'm goln'
home with y', Annie."
The drunken voice held a maydlin
tenderness and the drunken steps
quickened.
"But this isn't the way home." The
woman clung to him with the last rem
nant of her feeble strength. "Davie,
I'll â " Her voice broke in a desperate
Bob. "This Is the way to the railroad,
Davie, and we've got to get back by
seven to the Deer Creek shaft. Noâ
this way!"
With a final tug she succeeded in
turning him about, but her strength
vanished with the effort and she fell, a
little tumbled heap, at his feet. In
stantly the man bent over her, all ten
derness and concern.
"Why, Annie, Annie," he murmured
foolishly, and picked he.- up in his pow
erful arms. "Ye wor roight, of course,

road, pouring out his drunken endear
ments over the frail little creature un

arms reached out for the little figure,
but Houghton was the quicker of the
twer, and he gently raised the woman.
The man watched him in owlish sur
prise. "'Looks like it, though," mut
tered Houghton. "She certainly can't
walk that trail again."
"No, she can't walk." The drunken
man had caught the words. "I'll carry
*er." Again the unsteady arms were
stretched forth for Houghton's burden.
-*4'll carry 'er," he repeated. Hough
ton frowned him aside, his eyes cloud
inp with the trouble of the situation.
"I'll give you a lift with her â part
way, at least," he said, with a despair
ing thought for the train that would
pass â he did not know how soon.
He walked down the single street of
the hilly little town, past the saloons,
hideous in this revealing hour, out
across the little hamlet to the head
of the traJj which he had covered a few
hours before. The man followed un
steadily, tearfully reciting a long mon
ologue of self-reproach. Houghton
turned to him.
"Couldn't you get a horse and
wagon of some sort and take the
road?" he demanded.
"Road don't ro out our way," the
man replied. "Deer Creek's the hard
knot In the mountains, and we mostly
walks. I'll carry her. Let me take her,
my li'l Annie!"
"Now listen." he said. "I've got to
go back to â well, anyway, I â Can't
you wait here with her beside the road
until she's herself again?"
"Wait here? What for?" Hough
ton's spirits sank before the hopeless
stupidity of the query. "I've got to get
to work, but I can carry her. Let me."
Houghton shook his head.
"You'd kill her if you were to fall
with her again. Wait until she's over
this â or couldn't you leave her here
somewhere?"
"Leave her here? Leave Annieâ
here?"
The gray light was growing brighter
cner the cluster of wretched shacks
that formed the town, and Houghton
needed to glance over them but once
to realize that here there was no place
for Annie. He looked again at her wan,
sweet face.
"Docs sheâ has she fainted often?"
he asked.
"Pretty often." was the reply. "The.
life here's hard on her but she would
come because Iâ Jem tried to tell her
not to come, but she did. An' she's
Httle. an' weak-like In the back â "
Houghton felt a tug at his heart. He
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
SEVERED SHACKLES
was thinking of some one else who had
been "little, an' weak-like in the back,"
from the time that his baby eyes had
first learned to know her, in her big in
valid's chair, until the coffin lid had
shut away her patient smile forever.
All through the year of his prison Ufa
that smile had been with him, its light
making clear the dark places over
which his feet had stumbled, brighten
ing the future when his despairing
eyes looked into it, and at the last il
luminating the shadowy chance of his
escape. And now by the same light he
saw that come what might he could
not abandon this weak little woman iv
her helplessness.
But to go back over the trail that he
had covered in hot haste in the night-r
to Deer Creek Valley, of all placesâ
and with the stolen clothing upon hiral
If she would only come to! There was
no sign of change in the blue-white,
delicate face, no life In the wasted,
small figure. How could any one leava
her to the mercy of this blundering,
irresponsible wretch? Houghton set
his lips hard, and rising:, trudged mis
erably on. Davie staggered along ia
the rear, his head stupidly nodding at
each unsteady step.
Slowly the daylight grew, widening
the cheerless prospect about them;
the stunted brush, the rocky trail, the
murky river, winding its sullen way
among tne boulders. The cleansing
enows of winter hud not yet come, and
the water moved sluggishly, heavy
with refuse. Houghton strode along,
the little woman in his arms. Her
weight was as nothing, but at every
s*ep he felt the crushing pressure of
impending ruin.
Again he reviewed the events of five
days ago; his sudden discovery of the
plan to escape that had be?n perfected
by the others; his horrified recoil from
the method that they had adopted; and
then his determined opposition to the
-violent means that they had proposed,
and his triumph over the baser spirits
among them; even now he shuddered
at the thought of the horror that his
firmness had averted. Captured or
free, there would be no bloodshed to
answer for; nothing but the severing
of shackles, the breaking down of pris
cn bolts.
He thought again of the desperate
chance that had opened his prison
dcors; the marvel of finding himself
again at liberfcr; the greater marvel of
keeping that liberty, 1n the face Â«f a
hundred perils. The chances that had
befriended him; his lucky find of a
laborer's clothing, his well-sustained
disguise under the chaff of the hospi
table hunter who had fed him. He re
called the hunter's amusement over the
guileless brogue that he had affected,
and a bitter smile crossed his lips at
the recollection. To have had all this
work together for good, and then to
have to abandon it all, lest a drunken
man work harm to a weak little wom
an whose patient face had brought
back to him the rich heart life that had
once been his!
The prison doors yawned again be
fore him, and he groaned. How they
would laugh, the other inmates of the
prison, whose companionship he had
scorned! He pictured the whole hate
ful round of his prison life; the dally
association with debased and brutal
characters; characters that only grew
the more repulsive as his association
with them lengthened. To go back to
the torture of their taunts â to the long
agony of years that stretched ahead â
God! Who could tell how long a
chain?
The Cornishman had, of course, noti
fied the Sheriff that he had located one
of the escaped convicts; five hundred
dollars reward was too big a thing to
let slip through one's hands for a few
hours' delay, and even aside from the
reward it was easy to read in the Cor
nishman's bearing his stern, implac
able sense of Justice. To uphold the
law â Gerald Houghton had read that
upon the miner's brow as clearly as
though the words had been expressed.
Even now there might be a dozen men
between him and the railroad, and the
Sheriff on guard beside the water
tank. And here he was walking back
to the danger point from which he had
fled so eagerly. The theft of the cloth
ing would serve only to fasten more
firmly upon him the shackles of the
law. A burst of fury seized him as he
thought of the clamped irons again
about his wrists. If only the Cornish
man would kill him â shoot him in fron
tier fashion, or if â
Houghton came to a dead standstill.
The Cornishman was standing before
him. The somber, accusing eyes were
fixed upon Houghton, but the speech,
cold and mocking, was for the drunken
man.
"Hey, Davie, it's foine yer comln'
home at this hour. An' yer wife
cloimbln' the trail in the dark goin'
after ye â "
Then suddenly his eyas rested upon
the woman in Hc-ughton'ssarms. No
â wild beast could have matched the rage
in his eye or the fury of the mighty
grasp with which he fell upon Hough
ton.
"What have ye dene to her?" he de
manded, his great body tense with pas
sion.
Davie slunk sniveling down besida
the road, and ev<n Houghton quailed
before the wild sternness of his ac
cuser. But he met the stormy eyes
steadily.
"I haven't done anything to her,** h*
answered. "She's all right."
"Yes, Jem, she's all right," asserted
the cowering Davie, getting to his feet.
'"All roight! She looks it, doesn't
she?" returned the Cornlshman, still
with that terrible rage upon him, but
his sternness dimin'shed as he looked
down upon the little woman. Davie
again took refuge in tears.
"An' it's foine the co-npany yer keep-
In', too," went on the Cornishman, Jn
mocking scorn. "Thieves an'â"
"For heaven's sake!" burst out
Houghton in impatient fury. "Don't
stand there twaddling nonsense. I'll
go back with you. I'm not trying to
get away. Do whatever you will."
The Cornishman seemed to only
half hear him. Davie had launched
forth into a recital of his experiences,
and the Cornishman was intently lis
tening. '
" an' 'c come along from some
'eres out o' the dark, an' c' picked 'er

A marvelous change had come over
the harsh, mocking face of the Corn
lsriiimn.

\T_) of this great festival drama
have been limited to Bayrcuth
since ISS2. Befcrre that date- it

times foT the particular enjoyment of
Wagner's friend and patron. King
Ludwig. Mme. Wagner did not sub
mit vithout a struggle to what she
feels to be a sacrilegious and commer

pealed to law not only in Germany,
but here, and^thrc-ugh the reigning
family >>t Bavaria endeavored to pre
vent the passage of stage managers
and conductors and singers to this
country. But they were able to come
here, because there was no law to pre
vent them, tn order that the charge
of irreverence might not be made Mr.
Conried brought, from Germany artists
who have assisted at Bayreuth- An
other incident that adds a dignity is
the fact that "Parsifal" lias bten in
New York and wil! here be sung out
side the regular subscription. The hour
of beginning <-f the two evening pei- â 
formances is 5 o'clock in the ft after
noon, of the matinee li o'clock in the j
morning, separated by intervals for
rest and refreshment. No one >*ill be
allowed to enter after the action has
begun. Before speaking of the repre-.
ecntation as seen at Bayreuth I will
Kive as clearly as possible a synopsis
of the drama. The story is so vague
and symbolic that it is no easy matter
to clarify it.
Parsifal, posthumous son of Gam
uret and Herzeleid (heart's sor
row) is, when grown to man's estate,
solitary and irresponsible, having been
reared In perfect solitude from his
youth. '
Seeing a train of knights passing he
follows, hoping for an adventure; while
pursuing his way he shoots at and kills
a beautiful swan, and Is chided vehe
mently by the knights for his
cruelty. Guernemanz, an aged
hermit, thinks that because of
his purity Parsifal will save
the King Amfortas, dying of a mortal
wound, from death. Guernemanz con
ducts Parsifal to the temple in the cas
tle to witness the feast and to see the
unveiling of the Holy Grail (a crystal
cup). He is awe-struck into absolute
silence by what he sees, which Guer
nemanz mistakes for indifference, and
in disgust dismisses him, believing now
fully that Parsifal <Fal-pareiâ
enlightened by pity) is beyond
hope and teaching. Parsifal roves
again and In his wandering enters
Klingsor*s realm. Now Klingsor is
the evil epirit of Kundry, the unfortu
nate Mary Magdalene of the drama, for
this is a tale of the' Christ. Kundry
and a bevy of beautiful maidens try to
tempt Parsifal to stay with them, but
tauched by a vision of the King's mis
ery and remembering the Holy Grail
he breaks away. A poisoned spear is
flung at him by Klingsor, but his purity
gfves him a charmed life and it re
mains poised In the air. Pareifal seizes
it, and gardens, temple and flower
maidens vanlfhâ a token of righteous
victory. This closes the second act. The
third is supposed to pass many years
afterward.

"Indeed; I shan't," Estelle interrupted
eagerly. "How can I be sorry of â any

odious bond?" ,
Bronson did not answer. A stir â¢
about the door drew all eyes. Adonis, (

cousin, co-heir and fiance, entered ,

What George thought about it no
body knew. He smiled down at Adele
as they crowed to EateUe. When he
got a good look at her his smile be
came, for a breath's space, quizzical,
but it was kind and wholly cordial as
he took both her hands, saying: "I
know you all right, young lady- â if
you would never let me have your
picture."
"Somebody's brem telling." Estelle
said solemnly, although her eyes

danced. They had never rested upon
a finer fellow than George. He had
all the Gilbert look she so worshiped
in her father's portrait. Covertly she
glanced from him to BronsonâBron
son was big and honest looking and
had withal an air of breeding, but
RtUl was not to be named beside her
unwelcome betrothed. No doubt he
had more brains â although as time
passed she was forced to admit
George carried things off very well
indeed. And after supper, when the
dancing began, Bronson, the luckless,
went into complete eclipse. He hated
dancing, as well he might, seeing that
he danced so badly. George Gilbert,
contrariwise, might have been wing
footed, so lightly did he move, in such
perfect time and tune. Music, indeed,
was in the Gilbert blood. Estelle
danced, if anything, better. When
they waltzed together other couples
stopped to see. Indeed, they kept on
and on and on until they had the
whole crowd staring as alone they
whirled and wheeled over the waxed
floor of the hall.
"Stop Estelle!" Bronson implored in
1
in crowds to hear the muÃic of our
master â Wagner. At one time one went
almost with an apology, and
was spoken of as a crank.
To-day one goes with a seri
ous purposeâ pride, pomp and vain
glory are not there. 1 learned in look
ing over the stranger list that men and
womenâ clever, rich, famous the world
overâ were there, the fact, however,
a loud whjapet as the couple whirled
past him. George smiled broadly.
Estelle, dismayed, put a hand up to
her face. As she took it away two
pimples and half a dozen freckles
came with it, George saw them and
auickly guided her out of the light.
"Go wash your face!" he command
ed imperatively. "And the next time
you want to go masquerading, let me
help you make up. I know heaps of
better disfigurements^ besides grease
paint is fearfully unreliable, when one
loves dancing as we do."
"I forgotâ l ought not to have
danced," Estelle said contritelyâ then
with a swift change of mood: "But
you wjoukln't have known if I had
been a. little wiser."
"Indeed I would; I went five hun
dred miles last summer, just to see
you " George half whisoered. "So I
understood the minute I looked at you

to make me lose a wife and a fortune.
I don't blame youâ women have to

you like, and get back more than all

causing no comment. The utter ao
sence of a street car, the quiet that
reigns, make it a veritable Sleepy Hol
low, though the population 13 10,000.
The quaint sho-ps in the marketplace,
the walks to and from the Hof-Garten,
where all that was. mortal of Wagner
sleeps, the visit to Wahnfried Villa,
home of the familyâ all were of the
greatest possible interest. It was just
a pleasant stroll from Alexandra
strasse to the top of the beautiful hill
where the theater stands truly a shcine.
From the balcony that overlooks the
village one is called daily by the play
ing oL the principal theme or leit-motif
of the drama to be given that day. In
â¢Parsifal' it is from the Good Friday
music.
A quartet of trombonists sounds the
first call a half-hour before the per
formance begins, the second a quarter
of an hour later, the third five minutes
before the hour, and bt he Prince or
peasant, when once the doors are
closed the late comer cannot enter.
Lights are extinguished; there is not
the flutter of a programme, no ap-
I'laune, never a whisper is heard nor
the sound of carpenters' tools, and I
wondered how the noiseless shifting of
machinery was managed. No orches
tra i 3 visible and an expectant silence
reigns. The opera begins daily during
the season of one month at 4p. m. At
the close of the second act an hour is
given for dinner. Many go comfortably
to their homes in the village and re
turn. In the grounds of the theater are
two restaurants. At the one on the
right hand light meals of cold meats,
bandwictes and beer, tea, coffee and
chocolate are served; at the other an
excellent hot dinner. Indeed, anything
that one tan pay for can be had. The
last act begins at 8:15 and one is home
at 10 o'clock. At that time Anton Seldl
was living, and yet Siegfried Wagner
fr<om time to time conducted with Seidl
on the scene! Among the things in
"Parsifal" ever to be remembered, the
spectacle of the uncovering of the Holy
Grail (a cup wherein is the Savior's
blood) in the tir^t act is one of them.
As the knights knelt at the holy supper
their red clonks seemed to palpitate.
There is an atmosphere spoken of at
Bayreuth as the "Parsifal atmos
phere"âimpalpable and yet a very real
thing. The spectator contributes more
than he knows and criticism must be
advanced with delicacy.
And now this great play is almost at
our own door; and to the vast num
bers who will goâ for no one who can
make It possible to go should miss itâ
a word as to what scenes will espe
cially impress one.
Among the things to be forever re
membered are the scenes introducing
Parsifalâ after the wild swan has
say itâ not now, at least."
"That must be quite as you please."
George said, smiling over her head.
-You will have to go straight home,"
he added masterfully. "Changing lov
era would be nothing beside the scan
dal of changing countenances this
way in the face of everybody."
"I know It," Estelle said sorrow
fully. "Fate Is playing me tricks
putting all the trumps in Adela's
hands â "
"Not quite. You forgot I shall make
your excuses, and. take you and Mrs.
"Warreja home," George said. "Don't
keep me waiting, either. I'm all Im
patience to see â your real self."

Grasshope had no end of sensations
through the next blx weeka. The first
came when George Gilbert broke the
prearranged engagement, the next when
it was seen that he was disputing with
Reed Bronson- for first place in his
coysin's regard, and the third and
greatest was to find the strange Gilbert
girl truly a beauty,' with no end of fine
feathers and a most enchanting way of
wearing them. Adela Evans looked
faded and insignificant beside her, al
though away from her she was easily
the prettiest girl In town. But Adela
was spiritless these days. She no long
er had hopes of catching George. He
was eagerly, desperately in earnest
about Estelle. although she had given
him back, as in duty bound, rather
more than half the money. Reed Bron

them they kept public interest at fever

pathetic voice, a special protege of
Cosima Wagner. He will look and

Kundry is said among great dramatic
soprani to be most arduous. The
strain of being the unwilling Instru
ment of Klingsor and her constant
inner warfare ace enormous. Tha

all of the principals having that
cachet that only repeated Bayreuth
performances give to the Wajneruin
singers.

"Useful enough in its way." said
Brizintine â "that is, at parties and
funerals, but do you think it's busi
ness? In these day.?, you know, a*
man must be quick; but poIiK-ness is
slow."
"You've said just about ; what I
wanted you to say," Lim replied. "Po
liteness is not necessarily slow. It is
the gesture of the mind and may be
just as quick as gruffness is. One' of
the reasons that men who have been
prosperous begin Â«to fail along in later
years is because they have forgotten
the necessary politeness of the earlier
day. Politeness, when once forgotten,
can rarely be remembered. It ought .
to come when a feilow is young in or
der to seem natural. The fact is, it
must be natural, for there's nothin'
that is much, more awkward than, a â¢
man in his maturer life tryin' for the
first time to be polite. If a young fel
ler just startin' out in business would
sit down for ten minutes' a day and â 
give his mind to the study of polite
ness, not from a book or any sc-t form,
but from his own reflections, he would
find it the best investment of time he
ever made. Politeness is the actor of
kindness. It is intended to picture the
even and well-intended mind. It is a
pleasant thought set in visible mo
tion.'
"Lim, as the old nigger preacher
said, you are now puttin' the fodder a
little too high tor the calves."
"Not at all. I'm sfmply speakin'
common sen^e as I see it, and if I see
it, ybody ought. We very often hear
of polite old men. but there are more
polite young fellers than old ones. Ail
ments and disappointments make the
old man gruff, unless he has kept com
pany with books. He believes that he
has lived to see the uselessness of po
liteness, while with the young chap it
is still a matter of advancin' experi
ment." -
"Ah," Brizintine spoke up. "but if
the old man finds that politeness Is Â»
failure, why tell the young teller to
jiractice it?"
"Very well put. old man. Now let

in it? The fact is that the old man
began to fail about the time he for
got his politeness. Think I've got you
th'-re. Briz. If I haven't, I'm willing
to change the subject."
"I don't know that you hay. Any
how. I'd like to ask you this: What's
the use of a man tryin' to be polite if
he don't feel it? Why should he act
a hypercrit?"
"Shouldn't act a hypercrit. The
fact is, that if a nu;n begins early to
practice politeness it will after Â«i
while come natural to him. There
ain't nolhin' that tastes much \
at first than a chaw of tobacco does,
but alter a while It's .sweeter and

before, and had just begun to believe
that his work for all that long half a
lifetime was about to be rewarded by
n tei rifled countenance. But suddenly
Ihe feller whipped out a knife and
came at him. Afterward he discov
ered that what he took to be fright on
the feller's face was a scar left by a
scald. Now if he had spent all thati
time in practlcin' politeness it might
have netted him something. It
wouldn't have humiliated him. Very
few men have ever been humbled by'
practlcin' politeness. You've heard the
old story of a great man ridin' along
the road. They tell it on Washington
and Jackson and Clay, hut the moral
is the same no matter who it was. Hei
was a-ridln' along and met, an old ne- \
gro. The negro took off his hat. Then
the great man took off his hat. Some
one spoke to him about it. 'Why.' said
he. 'I can't afford to let a neero be
more of a gentleman than I am."
There's a lot . of good sense in that. \
And take it in the matter of a fieht. a<
moral or a physical fight. At the very,
beginnln' the polite man generally has
the other feller more than half whlD-^
ped. If I were givin' advice to a young- (
ster goin' away from home to seek hist

long as you are polite you have full
control of your temper, and master of*

the fawner. One is a man and the
other has missed it. His intention is
too plain. He shows that he wants to

Back of this instance of fatherly
forethought is the fundamental prin
ciple that it is important for any one to
start the day in the right mood. Who
of us older people does not feel the
need of some such sweetening and
steadying Influence at the outset of
each new day? Too often the cares of
yesterday come trooping back as we
slowly emerge from dreamland and if
some vexing problem must be dealt
with during the next 24 hours how
quickly that comes before us also. If
we could only secure, before the plunge
into the whirlpool of activity, just a
few minutes of happy, inspiring
houghts, what a difterence it would
make in the entire day!
Our parents cannot long secure this
desirable mood for us, but our own
vills, if resc-lute enough, can do much
o induce it. -Determine first of all that

| Phillips Brooks once voiced his won-,
der as to how men could come back
from unconsciousness to the world of
action without sending their thoughts
upward to the source of all life and
blessing. Some. families still muiatain
the beautiful custom either at break
fast table or elsewhere of joining in/
some simple act of worship. In view)
of all the risks and exposures to which \
every one is subject every day of his'
life and in view of the limitations of
one's strength and wisdom it seems
only natural and right to laim che
care and leadership of a power un
seen but real, that holds all humanity
in its grasp. There is * little prayer "of
Robert Louis Stevenson's which suits
, itself to the break of day, and which,
if said honestly by any one, is sure to
make the waking moments peaceful
and happy:
"The day returns and brings us the
petty round of irritating concerns and
duties. Help us to play the man.
Help us to perform them with laughter
and kind faces. Let cheerfulness
. abound with industry. Give us to jo
blithely on our business all this da.y.
Bring us to our resting beds weary
and content and undishonored. And
grant us in the cml the gift of sleep."VDAINTY handwear is the very es

Every once in a while a fashion flur:
sleeps by. and leaves a trail of <Jueerly
colored gloves in its wake, but never

There is scarcely a woman who isn't
bored to death occasionally over the
"everydayness" of things, but if ehe
has some one thing which interests her
above all others she will soon find
every Â«pare moment naturally devoted
to it; Certainly, 'the woman who cul
tivated the hobby of nobby, gldves is
more than busy, for before she realizes
it she had developed an interest' in
tones, colors and styles . . that : she
wouldn't have believed possible.. :
3PadÃ Atrd'ioiibies differ; "InasnTuch as
a fad is something transient, 1 while a
hobby is more lasting. Who, for in
stance, would call the wearing of
giores a-fad.' There Isn't any fad about
it,- as every one knows full well; but
even a common, ordinary " necessity
may be turned into a hobby" and ridden
for all it is worth.
Yet^why not? The stamp of a lady
is to be seen in the small items of her
wearing apparel â in her boots and
gloves, for â  instance. â  Look at a well
dressed woman, be she rich or poor,
and you can tell her birth and breeding
by the way she covers her hands and
feet. Take a hundred women, put
them back of a curtain, with only the
hands" and feet showing, and you can
pick out the lady every time. The
smooth, well-fitting shoe and the clean,
veil-fitting kid glove are hers, and hers
alone. 'v* â¢
Not any silk gloves for her. No,
thank you. She reaily cannot afford
them, for they not only make her hands
larger, but she considers them the most
extravagant of all wear and the most
untidy to the eye. She would every
hit as soon "slip her feet into carpet
slippers or the old-fashioned crocheted
slippers, because the result could not
possibly be any worse. Just as surely
as the felt comfort produces a broad,
flat foot and a large, spreading ankle
does the fabric glove get in its deadly,
unsightly work.
If you don't believe me, Mrs. Doubt
ing Thomas, rise up and tell me
where the world-famed, patrician
American hand has vanished to? Can
you find any traces of it anywhere?
Gore, it is, like the roses of last
summer, and directly traceable to
the wearing of silk and fabric gloves.
Are you " doubting still, Mrs. Skepti
cal?. Well, listen then. Not so very
long ago the European manufacturer
was obliged to make a specially small
glove for r.o other purpose in the
wide v.orld than to suit the American
hand, but now it has been statistically
proven that the hands of the Ameri
can \vomen have grown in an amaz
ing fashion until her ' European sister
can giVe her cards and spades and
then win' out >n the bargain.
So be it known to uninitiated that
fabric gloves have proven the most
disastrous fash'on for the beauty of
the hands that her Majesty Queen
FaEhion has seen for many a blue
moon.
And ' . not . only, that, . .miladi. Do
your hands chap and roughen, to
say nothing of getting red and re
quire a barrel of ointment, more or
leÂ«s? Silk gloves. And how about
your nails? Are- they pink and
smooth â with . a fine polishâ and,
above all. clean? Tell me if you can
how they can remain so with every
particle. 4ust and dirt penetrating
through the -orous material and
lodging in thÂ» nail. If you'll take
the trouble to notice you'll find the
nalr itself becomes brittle and easily
broken, so that it will annoy you by

of the glove.
The French women have clung to
kid thrmiÂ«fl thick and thin, and for
the best possible reason in the world.
They possessed the secret and fully
applied the T magic that â¢ made - the
hands of the famous beauties of the
French court so renowned for their
whiteness and softness. Watch the
gay little Parisienne fashion plate and
see how tenaciously she 'clings to her
klde_at night as , well as in the day
time. ... And the whyfore. Is Just thisâ
the" soft inside finish of a skin glove
is the beet whitewash for the hand,
as every woman ought to know full
well, for surely at some time or Othel
lo >v must have noticed how soft and
satiny the hands feel after drawing
off a pair of snug, warm gloves.
Surely all this should be reason
enough for relegating the fabric glove
to the darkest cranny in tlie closet, but
if it Isn't, listen to this and be prop
erly convinced: The most potent fac
torâstyleâthe arbitrator of fashion
herself, ha? so willed St. The penalty
has been paid and for fear of mon
strous red, chapped hands, her fiat
has gore forth. No more silk gloves
â no more lisle gloves â no more cotton

rived from th^ir reign, but as long as
you might just about at- well be dead
as out of the fashion I don't see any
oth?r way than to have your weep and
blindly follow the leader.
In a way .ts a shame, just as every
thing is elbow sleeves, because that is
the one beauty c-f silk glovesâ at the
time of purchase they are deeper than
the mnusquetaires, though thejfc do not
w ear as well nor look half tne glove

they are presentable, though, of course,
there is no-thing like the soft, delicious

and to moderate the defects of a poor

And there is one more reason,
though it is a state secret and has
never before been given away. Milord

You needn't worry in the least about
this change in style and fear that you
will be woefully behind tne times, for
there are so many fashions that you
cannot help, but be correct if you stick
closely to suede and place. Some are
m-jre elaborate than others, to be sure,
but the plain mousquetaire, buttoned
in various lengths and wrinkled above
the wrists are not always fetching,
but decidedly pretty and comfortable- as
well.
The Emprees Eugenic is a glove that
is awfully smart and rather too high
in price to become ordinary, for it is
embroidered in silk, silver and gold
bullion and looks as though it were
meant for royal occasions only. Wei!.
perhaps it was â at any rate, you may
be pretty certain that they will never
be common and that every woman
who wears them must have a jiocket
book royal in depth to match the
length of the glove.
The gloves that are the smartest are

with black sewing. Swagger: Yes,
too much so for anything. -In, fact,
they are the moat fetching glove on â¢
the market with but one exception,
and that is the white glove that boasts
an Alexandria cuff. And this is noth
ing more or less than a detachable cuff
made of suede, with gold braid and
two large gold buttons by way- of or
nament. The glove itself is just an
ordinary one-clasp affair, but it pos
sesses two patent snappers on the top
of each glove and this is the way the
cuffs remain in place, and are changed

THE TYPEWRITER IN CORRE
SPONDENCE (D. A. D.).â Strictly
speaking the use of the typewriter is
confined to business correspondence,
although it may be used in writing
informal letters to a close friend. It
is not permissible for formal com
munications and especially not when
writing to an acquaintance only on
any social matter.
THIN, IRREGULAR 'EYEBROWS
(Jess).â While the Irregular growth
cannot be wholly controlled, it can be
greatly lessened and the whole form of
the eyebrows much improved with sys
tematic" care. Brush the eyebrows daily
with a soft tooth-brush kept for the
purpose, training them in a graceful
arch. Constant endeavor, always brash
ing in the same direction, will show
wonderful results in a few weeks. To
stimulate the growth apply pure vase
line or lanolin, rubbing it Jn thorough^
ly just before retiring and heirs care
ful to brush the brows into shape- after
ward. Sulphate or rnurlat? of quinine
with vaseline makes an excellent tonic,
and any druggist will compound it for
you in proper proportions. This tonic
is also valuable for stimulatine the
growth of the lashes. Apply with a
small camelshair brush to the edge 3
of the lids.
BRITTLE FINGER NAILS (Young
Matron. â It is almost impossible to
keep brittle finger nails in a shapely
condition. Close cutting does not im
prove matters and it detracts greatly
from the appearance of the finger tips.
Begin at the root of the cvi? and feed
the nai'.s. Before retiring rub the nails
freely with sweet oil or vaseline and
wear loose kid gloves to protect the
clothing and bedding. The gloves
should be perforated at the palms and
the middle of the fingers to admit a
free circulation of air. Wear gloves
whenever possible while sweeping and
dusting or doing other rather coarse
work, for the texture of the skin is thus
preserved and damage to the nails pre
vented. After washing dishes wash the
hands In clear warm water, rinse In
cold water, anoint the nails with a lit
tle vaseline and wipe away all surplus.
Keep up this treatment of the nails
daily for a month and you will see a
marked improvement.
A DELICIOUS OMELET (Anxious).
To make a dainty omelet requires care
in the details of mixing the ingredients.
The following of these directions close
ly will result in a rich* golden sponge
instead or the usual thin feathery
mass. Fresh e?gÂ»-are absolutely es
-'.. Take four eggs, four table
spoonfuls of water, one-eighth spoon
ful of white pepper and salt. 1 Separate
the eggs and beat the whites to a stiff
froth, beat the yolks, add the water
and beat again. Put one tablespoonful
of butter In a frying pan ajid while it
is heating carefully stir the yolks Into
the beaten whites, adding the season
ing. Pour Into the hot frying pan and
when the underside is a delicate brown
place In a hot oven to set the top. The
moment it is done loosen the edges
from the ran with a knife, fold over
and serve on a hot platteT garnished
with sprigs of parsley and delicately
cut and fried slices of bacon. Nevef
beat and mix the egga and allow them
to stand for even five minutes before
cooking. Do not slam the oven door
shut, for the jar will cause the otnelet
to fall. To make fancy omelets spread
the top, before folding, with finely
chopped chicken, ham. parsley, cream
ed peas or jelly.
REMOVING WRINKLES (Mn. J.
B.). â The numerous wrinkles are doubt
less due to the impoverished state of
your system, especially the skin; due
to your long illness. Consult your fam
ily physician concerning the tonic and
be careful to eat only plain, nourish
ing food. This advice applies to any
one who is run down, whether from
sickness of other causes, as does also
the treatment following for the removal
of the wrinkles. Get all the sleeo pos
sible and always in a well and prop
erly ventilated room, ami wjrile btttld
ing up the system feed the skin throuarh
the pores by applying a pure vegetable
oil skin food. As your skin is very dry.
do not use hot water or have it
steamed, as you speak of doing. An
hour or so before going to bed wash
the face thoroughly with pure soap
and> warm water and dry wfth a soft
towel. Massage the face, neck and
arms, rubbing in the skin food as lon<
as the skin readily absorbs it. To erad
icate ihe deep lines across the forehead
T>lace the balls of the ringer tips in
the middle of the forehead and rub
gently but flrraly in an outward stroke
toward the temples; follow this by a
firm upward stroke. Continue each
movement about five minutes. Ta
smooth Out the careworn lines below
the eyes, place the tips of the indet
fingers at the inner corner of the lid
and give a gentle outward stroke to
the temrle.
TO RELIEVE CAR SICKNESS (A
and B).â Those who are subject to car
sickness should be very careful of their
diet, avoiding all sweets several days
previous to a. rauroaa journey, in tnis
'way they may escape some of the dis
tressing feeling, which â¢Is largely due
to biliousness. Aromatic spirits of am
monia in a half glass of water la a
most refreshing vivifler when faintness
is present. Ten or fifteen drops of the
essence of peppermint tvill'also subdue
any ordinary case of nausea, while soda
and mint tablets, obtainable at any
drug store, are also advised for ! the
nausea and headache Incident to rail
road travel. - A large fan. dark and
"substantial, is another comfort ,i when
traveling. To sit for even a few; min
utes in a hot station or a car may mean
a v headache for the remainder, of i the
journey, which a slight agitation of the
air ', with a ' fan woald relieve. When
the inconsiderate passenger ; in the seat
in front of you insists on keeoinjr;the
window open, the fan willasrain come
to the rescue in shielding you â¢ from
cinders and . from violent draught. ?* If
the day is very hot carry a small bot

PARIS. April 8 âChristopher Colum
bus was a man of Hmited intelligence
and untruthful proclivities, according
<=nry V'grnaud. m%o for neariy
thirty years has been secretary' of the
American embassy in Paris. From
early youth Vignaud hat- devoted near
ly all his leisure time to the ttu-iv of
irabtta. H? has in his library, "n
ci thÂ»- finest private collections in Eu-
T' p* . than 13.000 vol
- all known works relating ;
lumbue. And for man- be has
recognized as- -aiest

iaims that Columbus posed before
I as the genius whin o
In IK'l Vignaud siartied Columbian
y the publication of his book,
"ToFcaneili and Coiunibus, ' proving
that the well-known letter attributed
be Italian astronomer, which repre
5 Columbus as endt-ivoring to pro
ceed bo india westward, was
& forgery *nd that ,nstead of plunging
the unknown in search of the east

would find the island* he was in quest

In a forthcoming work Vignaud has
developed the real character of Colum
bus as displayed in his youth, and it is
far from being wholly creditable. Hav
ing this much off his hands. Vignaud is
gathering evidence - rown-
Ing work of all, which, giving Cor the
â¢ first time the full and authentic history ;
of the discovery of America, will, Vig
*naud says, shatter Columbus as a gre.it
genius and leave him only as the in
. strument of a great deed.
DISCOVERERS IXTEXTH
"I have not 6ought to attack Colum
â¢' bus, but to separate fiction from his
tory." Vignaud said when I questioned
concerning his ideas and intentions.
.â¢ "The object which I have hafl in mind
for many year 6 is to prove that the his
â¢ tory of Columbus is imperfectly known,
and that the most erroneous ideas pre
vail as to the true causes of the dis.
covery of America.
"Like*all men who have left notes
and papers on the events in which they
have played a part, Columbus arranged
things as be wanted them to be
known. It is with the utmost difficulty
that critical study has succeeded in
setting aside from this doctored history
numerous facts which Columbus and
â  * the interpreters of hJs ideas had intro
duced. This. work of rectmcatlon pro
gresses slowly. It commenced long
since ard etill continues. My ambition
is to complete it.
"The conclusion which I reach is that
Columbus never intended to go to the

Indies, and that it was only after his
voyage, when he thought he had reach
ed India, that he announced that he al
ways wanted to go there. What he
really hoped to accomplish was to dis
cover new lands, concerning which he
thought he had information.
"The glory of Columbus is certainly
diminished by these studies. As a man,
he was neither truthful nor of superior
attainments, <"oiumbus can only be
called a great man if we- understand by
that term those who have accomplished
great things. But if one means a man
whose intelligence can grasp the hid
den connection of things, which gives
prescience and which is the veritable,
form of genius, then Columbus was not
a great man.
WHERE HE WAS SI PERIOR.
"He displayed superiority in two
things alone, energy and perseverance,
qualities which are often characteristic
Of mediocre men. In his whole careei,
Columbus never took the point of view
<jf genius. He was mistaken in all his
previsions, and persisted in his errors
even after making discoveries which
should have sufficed to open his eyes."
"But," was interposed, "might not an
objection be raised? The sources of
Columbian history are surely accessible
to every one. Washington Irving.
Harris*? and Fiske, to mention only
the American authors, must have been
acquainted with them all?"
However enlightened one may be.
there is always something to learn."
answered Mr. Vignaud. ThiÃ Is par

ticularly true of history, which consists
not pf material facts alone, but whose
importance depends upon the meaning
with which these facts are invested.
Fur a long time the history of Co
lumbus, which is that of the discovery
of America, was known solely through
Columbus himself, that in to say,
through the papers which he left, and
which were =f-t forth by his first two
biographers, his son Fernando and Las
Cesas. The books which these two
wrote gave us our Columbian tradi
- and served as foundation for our
best works on Columbus. But little by
little it was observed that many facts
advanced from this source were er
roneous, and with time the number of
facts thus contradicted by criticism be
came so great that it was necessary to
revise carefully all that tradition had
to say about the discoverer of America
and his work."
CAREER OF VIGXAI D.
Henry Vignaud, who is now passing
a green old age in peaceful diplomatic
work and historical research, has had
a most adventurous career. Born at
New Orleans in 1830 of an old Louisiana
family, he started teaching in the pub
lic schools when he was 22 years old.
and four -years later turned his atten
tion to newspaper work, editing first
â¢L'Union de Lafourche" and then "La
Renaissance Louisianaise."
At the outbreak of the war he en
listed in the Confederate service and
was appointed captain of the Sixth
Louisiana Regiment. Captured and
restored to provisional liberty in New
Orleans in 1562. he learned that he was
about to be arrested by the Federal au
thorities and sent to Ship Island as
prisoner on account of his strong sen
timents Before the arrest could be
effected he bribed an official to supply
him with a pass enabling him to leave
the city and he escaped to Paris.
Vignaud was appointed secretary of
the Confederate Diplomatic Committee
in Paris and retained this post as long
as the Confederacy required his ser
vices. During this period* feeling ran
high in I'aris among the Americans set
tled there, and Northerners and South
erners were divided as sharply as in
the United States. The measures taken
by the Government after reconstruction
left Vignaud free to return home when
he wished, but he had by this time es
tablished firm ties in Paris.
In 1569 he was appointed secretary of
the Roumanian Legation in Paris. His
splendid diplomatic work attracted the
attention of his own countrymen, then
reunited, and he served on the Alabama
Claims Commission in 1872. In Febru
ary. IST.i, Irnernl Grant wiped out olÂ«l
scores and paid a generous tribute tÂ«>
Vignaud's ability in appointing him
secretary of the American Embassy in
Pari?.
In the successive changes which have
passed over the embassy Vignaud has
been the only man to remain constantly
at his post, whUe Embassadors have
retired or other secretaries have been
transferred to other points. He has
seen American representation in France

TO HER OLD FRIENDS

I'ootman and Domestic
In England.
LONDON. April B.â When Miss Daisy
Leiter resided with her sister. Lady
Curron, at the old prinory at Reigate
she was a favorite with rich and poor
alike. It is not surprising, therefore,
that as the Countess of Suffolk she
should renew acquaintances with her
old neighbors. A few days ago sho
drove around in a luxurious motor car,
visited several shops where she was in
the habit of making small purchases
and spoke freely to eevry one whom she
recognized.
She visited an old women who used
to do some light cleaning at the priory
and left her a substantial money gift
to remind her of old times. The local
postman who used to deliver her mall
looked her up when he heard she was
in the neighborhood, and congratulat
ing her on her marriage he. too. was
presented with something handsome.
Lady Suffolk and her father used tn
be fond of taking long walks through
the fields in the neighborhood of Rei
gate and were accustomed to call regu
larly at a farmers house, where they
would have a glass of milk. The
Countess did not forget this farmers
cottage during her recent visit.

DOWRY
IS A GIFT
FROM DUKE
Connaught to Sup

Princess.
No State Aid Asked
for His Daughter
About to Wed.
-.â¢ < '"aft!* to ThÂ« CÂ»ll.
LONDON. April B.â ln these demo
cratic days English folk are getting
very critical concerning what they have
to pay to enable the actons of royalty
to maintain themselves in style. The
intimation made that there will be no
request for a grant to Princess Mar
garet of Connanght to help her along
when she sets up housekeeping with
Prince Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden
Is doubtless inspired by this knowledge.
Her father, the Duke of Connaught.
and brother to the King, was granted
175.000 a year when he came of age in
1871; and when he married twenty-six
years ago Princess Louise Margaret of
Prussia an additional $40,000 annually
was bestowed upon htm. His wife's
marriage portion was a moderate one,
but on the death of her father she
came in for a snug sum. As neither
the Duke of Connaught nor his wife
has been addicted to extravagance
they should be pretty well off by this
time, and will give their daughter a
comfortable "dot" on her marriag*.
And a popular princess who becomes a
bride nowadays can confidently expect
a fortunes worth of Jewels in presents.
It is interesting to recall that the
Princess and her mother probably both
owe their lives to the good old Queen's
prejudice against "new-fangled fix
ings." The birth of the Princess Mar
garet at Bagshot Park was followed
by alarming symptoms which greatly
troubled the physicians. The Queen
drove over from Windsor to judge for
herself what was wrong. She insisted
that potsonous air must be penetrat
ing into the room -<f the invalid from
the washhand basins in the royal
dressing-room. Experts were sum
moned and the presence of the foul
air was proved. It was a case of
faulty plumbing.
It was clear that the Duchess was
being poisoned and the Infants life
jeopardized in that sumptuous house.
The Queen insisted that both mother
and child should be removed to her
own old-fashioned apartments at
Windsor. It was the depth of winter;
the distance little short of fifteen miles
âa desperate risk, the doctors said.
But the Duke of Connaught added his
authority to that of the Queen, and in
half an hour a well -warmed carriage
with four swift horses was at the door,
and the young mother and the baby
Princess were safe at Windsor before
that short day's cloee.18

his way here.
At our heels had followed the repre
sentative of another Journal. There
were cards sent tn, always by the smil
ing Rossi-Figaro, all through the hour
I had with the singer. Liquid Italian
voice* pleaded for admission. Tele
phones rang. There were sheets on
the table headed by the name of an
interviewing newspaper. The
door wa* continually assailed. That the
finger, great, broad-shouldered fellow
a* he is. had dark ringe round his
dark-r eye*, that his first words after
greeting us were a childlike "I am very
tired." one co-jM not wonder. Signor
Tlossi chorused "Re ie very tired." But
Mr Meltcer cried incredulously,
Tired'
'It is, monÂ«iÂ«ur, " Carueo protested,
waving an explanatory hand through
the air. "as far from New York to here
as from St. Petersburg to Milan. Oh,
bo far! I did not think there was such
a distance anywhere."
This was in French when it was not
in Italian. It was in a voice that made
speech a song. It wm in a sort of
vocal r.ectarâ creamy, glowing, that
would have made the Orphean flute a
superfluity. Further, it was with what
in a woman we label a poutâ a distinct
pout. And Mr. Caruso's chin, with its
cherubic cleft in the cushioned center,
added comically to the effect.
The pout gave way to a smile, how
ever, as I pleaded immediately then fo.
a specimen of the Caruso pencil. In
ftmctively, artist-fashion, his hand
to hie pocket. He pulled out a
bunch of letters to look in vain for a
blank envelope. I pointed to the
sketching apparatus I had brought.
Si*mor Caruso laughed outright then,

he asked me, and I said if he
would be so good as to caricature him

Et rr.oi. aussi. I suggested.
But Mr. Carusoe heavy l!da and
browe went up. No, he mould
not caricature me. It was a delicate
rr.atter to caricature a woman. He
did not caricature women he knew â

I pulling over the fat sketchbook,
turned over its leaves until he reached

leaves one after another caricature of
himself appeared, as II Duca. as Ed
jtard^. as Canio. as himself with a
"s like vocal cigars shooting

bc laughed.
VNot so beautiful," I bowed, and
Caruso - jghed. But so it was. The
caricaturist, and he is facile and ac
complished with . the grotesque pencil,
had not at all spared himself. Nor had

ognized in the sketches. . Scotti. Jour
ntt, Blass, Hertz. Goritz, all were there.
and the caricatures upon this page . will
chow the quick and lively sense of the
pictorially absurd that is possessed by
the artist. He settled down again to
his caricature of himself â¢ then, , and '. I
asked him which he preferred, to sing
or to draw.
I don't know," he replied, smiling,
oesibly if $1600 a night iapproxi
mately* were paid to caricaturists we
should have Mr. Caruso illustrating Mr.
< 'raw ford's Police Court sketches on
Tte Call. Deftly, rertainly. the pencil
went over \b>- paper and between
wMftsa Mr. Meltzer and myself asked
the story of Caruso's life. He was,
on!y in spotÂ«. monosyllabic in reply,
with absorbed lips tightened under his
little Japanese mustache, and his hand
some black eyce bent to the drawing.
I thought of the pout I had seen and
decided as I watched him that there
was nothing else feminine in the sing
make-up. Co!ossally-shou!dered,
gr^at-throated and with his five feet
nine or ten, Signor Caruso towers
among tenors.
1 did not ask him. for I knew that
the Finger is the son of a small me
chanic and that until be was 18 years
Â£ himself had worked as such in
his father's shop. He sang as a boy
soprano in church, and made hie first
important appearance in an opera by
an amateur called "L'Amlco Fran
cesco."
Vergine only, he told me, has had the
teaching of him, and that only for three j
years. Two hours only a day he gave
to ftudy. and at first had but one les
son a week. Eight years ago he was
soundly hissed, off his own native stage
â¢âa fact that eeemed only to amuse the*
â ingerâ on going back to the game
theater in the same part, left open by
the defection of his , substitute, Caruso
had his first victory. The singer's
square Jaw did a little ' square itself (
here, and his eyes tossed over a dis
tinct tminkle. Since: then it' has been
pretty plain sailing. ; But it- was only
the season . before last that Caruso
made his big triumph in New York,
and in "Rigoletto," in which he , has
sent Ban Francisco wild this week. He
shrugged ; his shoulder* amiably as I ,
asked him the inevitable query:
"Which role he preferred?"
"All of them." he laughed, waving the
pencil through the air.
Why there are so many more good
voices to the square inch in Italy than
in America. I asked him then â whether
he thought it was climate, heredity or
the influence of the more natural use
of the vocal chords in the open vowels
of the Italian tongue. At this Caruso
put down his busy pencil.
"It is. I think, largely the climate."
he decided. "Every little village in Italy
is full of good voices. But it is again
the language. in which the vocal
chords * are used more easily, as they
should* be. though there is no reason
why English should not be spoken as
naturally as Italian. Only, it is not.
But there are not more good singers
there than elsewhere; there is only
more good material. Good singing is a
matter* of brains and cultivation every
where."
Signor Rossi here interrupted with
a bow, such a bow! wasted villainous
ly on anything but the jovial barber
of Seville. Signor Caruso was wanted,
imperativelyâ desired by two of his
countrymen for just a moment. The
signor would go â he is amiable to a
degree. ' Signor Rossi, like a pink
tighted page, preceded him to the ad
joining-room, then returned to depict
in genial pantomime the scene. That
I have not a caricature of Signor Ca
ruso's - guide, philosopher and friend,
his face a mask of Comus crowned
by curls even that kink into a sort
of laugh, is a serious mistake.
Caruso soon returned, after a py- !
rotechnic flow of "Is" and "r-r-'s" I
from the next room, and again took |
up his pencil. His plump, taper fln- !
gers were now at the humorous stub- j
bing-in of the little double chin and ;
he laughed as he did it. A line, two j
lines, and he had dashed in the collar. I
A soft. firm, quick scratching and the .
hair was in. Then followed the brave, j
bold signature, "Enrico Caruso, San j
Francisco," and the portrait was j
mine.
â  Had he studied drawing?" I asked
then.
"For a time, at school in Napoli."
the singer replied.
"And you will really not caricature
me?"
'No. no." Caruso laughed. "I will
caricature Mr. MelUer instead." And
so he did. in a swift ten minutes.
"I mutt show you." he preluded
then, and showed me the two draw
ings of himself aforementioned. One
by Jan Styka is excellent, firm. bold,
characteristic, admirable particularly I
in the handling of flesh textures, but j
Caruso thinks it a little overlike Me
phistopheles. The second drawing is j
by William Carey Brazington, also j
clever if not so characteristic as the j
first, and the singer particularly de-
Rires that they should be exhibited.
The thought is charming. His own
name he T knows needs no advertise
ment, but the artists are his friends,
and to spread their fame he carries
the pictures along with him and has
them exhibited in some prominent
place in the city in which he is sing

The Signor Rossi had rollicked
from the room a little mysteriously
while this was going on, and afterward
a waiter and a champagne cooler ap
peared, evidently in the connection. I
tried desperately to remembe the
French for muffins in order to ex
plain that tea and muffins was my
limit at an interview. Caruso, how
ever, looked so hurt nnd astonished
when I said "no" that I promptly
spilled half a glass over my ironclad
rule. Over the wine the singer ex
pressed an ardent admiration for the
American musical public, then "pour

"Caruso" and presented me with it.

THEATERS OFFER
In piquant contrast to the opera is
"The Other Girl," Augustus Thomas'
latest and best comedy, now at the Co
lumbia and to-morrow to begin its sec
ond and last "week. Lionel Barrymore
as the pugilist has achieved a solid and
delightful success, and is handsomely
supported by a company that includes
Francis Byrne as a newspaper reporter
that is as good as Mr. Barrymore's pu
gilist. As Mr. Barrymores pugilist
could not be bettered, this is saying
everything that need be said.
Miss Anglin brings a new comedy by
Madeleine Lucette Riley to the dra
matic grist of the week. The play is
entitled "The ]..ady Paramount." and
is said to offer Miss Anglin happy op
portunities for the display of her de
lightful high comedy capacities. Mr.
Worthing is also happily placed, and
Hall McAllister will reappear as an
optimistic land agent. Mrs. Whiffen
as a 70-year-old flirt will doubtless add
largely to the joys of living.
To-night the Tivoli will offer for the
first time in stock the popular musical
comedy "Florodora." There will doubt
less be many desirous of renewing ac
quaintance with the comedy In the ex
cellent production that will be given
to it by the Tivoli.
The Alcazar will have this week a
most persuasive attraction in a new
Irish cemedy by Andrew Mack, the
famous Irish comedian. The comedy
is written about the life of Tom Moore
and has had considerable success in

D'ALBERT'S STRONG
AND_WEAK SPOTS
And still D'Albert; From lukewarm
likings and lazy championships this
small titan has certainly delivered us.
The latest to hold a brief for the pian
ist is Dr. A. Wilhelmj in last Satur
day's Argonaut. It is a brief a l'ap
passionata. It is further a dignified
and fairly complete exposition of the
defense in the D' Albert argument.
Why. though, have forgotten the beau
ties c-f the D'Albert tone, round, deep
and succulent as Kreisler's own? Why
have forgotten the infinitudes of the
D'Albert touch? These, at least, none
will deny. To much of Dr. Wilhelmj's
plea for the pianist as "the greatest
artist of the piano" of the age there is
and must be strenuous denial.
U all depends upon what you want
from a pianist. Dr. Wilhelmj gets all
he wants from D'Albert. I don't. A
great many other fairly respectable
musical folk do not. Take his Chopin.
Of the earmarks of genius is eclecti
cism. The wider the vision, the larger
the sympathy with all <>f pain and
passion and sweetness that have wrung
themselves out into the music of the
world, the greater the man. Some one
hfts said that D'Albert's Chopin al
ways wears trousers." It does. \vhÂ»n it
wears anything. But may it be sug
gested that Chopin himself does not
always wear trousers'.'â to keep the fig
ure. What of the filmy laces and lin
gerie that bend over the jeweled cradle
in the "Berceuse'" What of the proud
and delicate feet that flit through a B
minor mazurka? What of the woman's
moment in the opus 53 Polonaise, when
across satin floors, her slender and ra
diant body disdaining the jewels that
caress it. the subject princess of Po
land moves to its glorious pageantry?
What, too. of the pale and passionate
faces of women that gleam through
the moonlight of the nocturnes? Tlv
inherent evidence here is al! against
trousers.
Chopin, in good sooth, has painted
the woman in music as she has never
before nor since been painted. And
one wants her when she is there. Ont
no more wants the sexless, colorless
quality of the D'Albert "Berceuse," the
obstinate masculinity of his Ballade
Op. 57, than one wants the epicene
Pelleas of Sarah Bernhardtâ which all
nice people say she gives. No, D'Albert
before the eternal feminine in music is
as impotent as De Pachmann before
the masculine need of the B minor so
nata of Mr. Chopin. "Gemuth." , Dr.
Wilhelmj owns, that he may lack "to
some." "Gemuth," to me. and to all
that I have so far heard express any
opinion, D'Albert here lacks almost
wholly.
Twice in his letter to the Argonaut
the critic ascribes to the pianist the
â¢perfect" plastic sense. It is his lack
of plasticity, the hard and rigid line,
the angular quality, that to many of
us is D'Albert's chief offending. In the
Schumann "Carneval" for example.
"Pierrot" and "Columbine," "Chopin"
and "Chiarini" were all drawn with
the same harsh pencil, hard blacks,
hard whites, hard angles and posed in
most irreverent haste. The outline
only, to which Dr. Wilhelmj expressly
says D'Albert does not confine himself,
was not seldom the only impression
convoyed.
Nor were these outlines by any
means always true. Dr. Wilhelmj
speaka of D'Albert's "compelling logic."
Apropos, he evolves Before this some
what mystifying dictum: "Even if he
sometimes neglects the instrumental
part or allows the bass to
predominate unduly â no matter;
the power of his rendering
shakes us to out depths." But
what is logic in plane playing? Is not
the perfect balance of melody and ac
companiment of treble, alto, soprano,
bass a large part of musical logic? Dr.
Wilhelmj himself owns that D'Albert's
bass "sometimes" predominated un
duly. I should say "frequently." The
soprano melody â which the critic evi
dently means by the "instrumental
part" â was commonly neglected in fa
vor of any other melody, and as be
fore said frequently drowned out by
the accompaniment. The effect, with
the lack of commas in the phrasing,
with the inflexible rhythms, was, again
frequently, anything but "logical."
How after this the learned doctor can
say that "D" Albert evolves everything
from the music, that there is nothing
in his conception that is artificial," I do
not understand. If Mr. Beethoven
writes a theme for the soprano, and M.
d'Albert insists upon piling the bass
and everything else on top of it. it
sÂ°ems to me that there is a consider
able and highly undesirable obtrusion
of the D'Albert personality.
As I have before said, the haunting
impression that D'Albert can but will
not give you the very tremendously big
thing is at the bottom of the irrita
tion his playing largely arouses. For
that is what he does g:ve you some
time?. One is silent and adoring be
fore his colossally impassioned render
ing of the first movement of the "Ap
passionata" sonata. Here everything
falls into magnificent proportion, in a
music drama as classically lined and
poised and passioned as an "Antigone."
His Brahms Variations were magni
ficent almost all through. The "big"
sonata, op. 111. was big in its biggest
moments. And that is D'Albert. He is
an Alexander, disdainful of his con
quests, hungry for new worlds to con
quer. Perhaps when a new Brahms
comes, with a sonata that would take
two men and a pianola to play. D'Al
bert may consider It worthy of his
powder and shot.
OPERA PROGRAMME
FOR PRESENT WEEK
Following is the opera programme for
the week, with its chief novelties in the
production of "La Gloconda" and of
"Die Fledermaus." Our New York
friends were greatly exercised over the
production of the rollicking Strauss
opera during a grand opera season.
Dippel capering through the part of
Yon Eisensteln. Goritz betraying him
self as dangerously near the low com
edy line as Frank, the rest all in key.
with Madame Sembrich herself setting
them the frolicsome example, appealed
not at all to the grand opera dignita
ries of the press. Yet the last perform
ance of "Die Fledermaus" drew the
record audience of the history of the
house, with the converted critics laugh
ing tears adown their solemn cheeks.
The cast of â¢ Gioconda" is like the
cast of "Les Huguenots"â draws fry its
nÂ« n weight. It include* Nordlca, Scottl
and Caruso to begin with.
The appearance of the second Kun
dry in Miss Olive Fremstad in Tuesday
evening's "Parsifal" is another evenr of
note. Philip Hale on Mis* Fremstad a
Kundry made the startling comment
"that it was only the stage directions
of Wagner that prevented Parsifal from
succumbing to the seductions of .Kan
dry as interpreted by Miss Olive Frem
stad." Miss Fremstad gown in the
Circean scene, devised by herself. is
said to be of extraordinary beauty.
Goritx Beckmesser. again, is said to
be alone worth going to hear in next
Saturday's "Die Melstersinger." â  And

"Simple Lifers" Leaving Town
The green fields are calling.
All the "simple lifers" have hied them
thither, for the fields are calling, with
their splotches of blue lupine and
golden eechecholtzia. Where, indeed,
in all tne world, could fields yield up
euch gladness 86 the fields of Califor
nia? Then what wonder the exodus to
the open! Here in truth is the blessing
cÂ£ competence â the true value
of mcney. It brings one near
the throbbing breast of nature,
nurturing the babes of the
voiceless world â the world of uncon
scious soul strength and of gladness.
But is it not of recent growth â this
love of the warm, crude â among
- the chosen of God's people? For his
chosen seem mightily to be the rich.
And my reasoning is simple-^as be
come* a. woman. For if- they were not
th* chosen, then they wouldn't have
their own eweet choice of staying in a
town, or getting out into the velvet
fields or straying in the pregnant
wood*? Xow, would they?
But I am assured that that dear
minister-man that wrote the "Simple
Life" wrought a most prodigious revo
lution in the lives of smart-set Â«fÂ»men.
And, r,f course, the women influence
the men. It is a well-known fact that
oar dear, devoted American men
haven't time â the disposition â to
read such "rot" as the 'Simple Life."
when there's no money in it. N>ces
e*rily the wife, to uphold the intellec
tual standing of the housÂ»hoid. reads
the "correct thing." and then proceeds
to hammer it into the overwrought
brain of paterfamilias.
Resultâ the heglra to the country.
Now. it may be that His Lordship
accedes to the correct thing for peace's
sake. Such things are of record, you
know.
But the results are noted thus: that
the smart set has been suddenly
Etricken with the desire to get close to
nature, and here's to their succeeding!
All the well-known country seatsâ and
California has a-plentyâ are in process
of airing, for the Madame's coming.
But the operaâ that is holding a lot
â¢f sincere lovers l of the warm glebe.
However, the signs of. the times are
cheering. There's money enough for the
opera, and money enough for the open'

nature Is shown as a most unjudgable
mixture of good and cvil â charac
ters are too human to be blameless,
too like the real God-made creatures
to be beyond love's forbearing when
their actions are fully summed up.
Th^ 6tory Is represented to be told by
a Russian doctor, Fedor Delarof, whosa
leading characteristic is a rough, di
r*cc manliness; at a in telling his story
he uses a copiousness of quaint and
forceful phrase which enables him to
explain in a most Jnterestingly detailed
way how he took â inconsider
ately in Borne moods, often seriously,
and sometimes to ta*k. and how he
looked out sympathetically, critically,
smusedly- upon the characters whose
lives interplayed with his own. He Is
strong of arm. bold of temper, of fresh
maturity as to age. skeptical In reli
gion! frank" of speech about himself,
And in the item of making love to wo
men, scenes in which he plays his part
to the leading lady might be staged
with the assurance of an audience lis
tening with eager interest for eacK
word and move that that strong, origi
nal. surprise party of a man was going
to tay and do next.
The scene of the story is laid in a lit
tle shut-in sort of a world of its own In
small compass, so that its almost com
plete isolation makes the people in it
play out their life parts in a kind of
narrowed, half prison-like environment
which intensifies the importance of
every word and act as the characters
help to fix their own and each other's
destiny. ~' ; --'**vJ
ThÂ« place is a Russian trading poÃt
and colony at Sitka, Alaska, under the
rule of Baranof, who, in the role of
commander, is -one of the strongest bits
of characterization in the novel. He is
a commander, indeed, albeit a rough
one. In him Is the tangle of good and
evil traits, which too puzzles the will
to oily condemn and makes us glad
to leave the Judgment of such types to
the 11-knowing wisdom of supernal
powers. He is strong, stern, strict, hon
est and devoted to the task set for his
life's work. He is magnanimous some
times in forgiving when there are noble
reasons for it." He loves women as well
at vy-four as he ever did. but when
in his cups treats them with vulgar and
-Â«Fing gallantry. He is always
half slave to drink, and haa been that
slave to passion which has brought to
him the possession of a proud, sensi
tive, terribly unhappy half-breed
daughter.
Fhe, too, is one of the book's master
pieces of portrayal, and because of her
come the complications that make the
Eomberness and the â trength of the love
parts of the story. But to return to
Baranoff : It is wonderful to note how
this evil man keeps a large measure of
self-respect, and even, astonishingly
t-ometimes, as from a throne of supe
rior rectitude. . lectures Fedor, who
thought himself morally his better, till
our hero recognizes his error and feels
that in some sense Baranof rules of
riÃht
A passage which gives at once a
wift insight into the bearing of Bara
nof and the why of his . self-justifica
tion for it. and the nature of the con
ditions at Sitka at the time, and the
quality of the. Russian policy, is this:
Fedor's manly anger had beâ¬n re
buked by Baranof. Fedor says: " And
for this time, for the sake of the com
pany. I am to hold no wrath." Bara
nof straightened himself quickly, and
answered before the words had fairly
left my mouth: 'Not only this, but
every time." he said with earnestness.
'It is the first lesson that is given to
.you to learn. In this land the company
is not a- business to be put on and off
at a whim. To you, to me, and to
every soul it touches, it is God himself,
and there are no other gods before
him. It feeds the Indians and clothes
and pays the whites, and there is no
room under It for anything that does
not yield obedience to its will. Look
at the charter granting it , which fixes
and defines its powers. Shelikof, in
our begetting, promised for us two:
"things:' we must be both law and gos
pel to the people we should , find, and
above ell v things we must extend the
territory' of the Czar. The obligation ,
to go out and govern was at first a
permission and a request, but it was a
request that since has grown by ukase j
a command.* **
So we comprehend something of the
Ruesian character and the nature of
the discipline which made the forceful
Fedor yield to the mastery of the over
bearing Baranof as if he were a Czar.
Even to submission to lashes of the
knout did Fedcrr bend his manly pride
and courage; but the daring act which
brought this punishment was done for
the woman he loved. Baranof had tried
to kiss her against her will when he
was half drunk, and Fedor had struck
him down. The woman had. from hid
ing, watched his agony and shame, and
hurried to meet him with her sympathy
on his way home. The style in which
he tells of this little episode with his
lady is characteristic. Guess how you
would like Fedoi-. from this brief
glimpse. He had no right at that time
to kiss the girl he wanted, but he tried.
"She pushed me back with her hands.
I was ashamed that I had forgotten
myself, and freely let her go. "Forgive,"
I said, humbly, the temptation was
more than I could bear." â¢ â¢ â¢ So I
left her standing in the shadow, and
took my way back toward the post.
I suppose a sorrier figure of a lover sel
dom thus parted company with his
maid. In ordinary, my carriage is suf
ficiently erect, and I affect a decen^
neatness in my dress; but now my back
was stiffened with the pattern of a
whip, my hair disheveled, and my legs
so weak that my walk was only an
unseemly drag. But I do not believe
that daintier lover ever felt a greater
lightness <>f heart. I forgot not only
my present ills, but even the troubles
that were to come, so that my progress
was on air because of pleasant self
communion. Thus, in spite of physical
distress. I was able to look back brave
ly at Petrovich when I met him at the
barrack door, and even made my greet
ing with a smile."
Perhaps here is a good place to give
a little glimpse o? the lady of our hero's
love. Its the beginning of his inter
est. She's on board ship, hound for
.*itka to meet Alexei. between whom
end her had been made a youthful en
gagement. Her father is dying.
"The girl, of course, made duty of
her love. She had small heart for any
thing in life, and sat Cor hours, dry
eyed and silent, and watched h^r fath
er's face. * â¢ â¢ Yet hers was not
a despairing grief. I could pee that
with the splendid courage of youth,
because she hoped the thing might be;
her heart believed there was a chance
he would not die. â¢ â¢ â¢ Th e first"
night ot vigil she sat at her father's
head hour after hour, as white and still
ac if she were no woman, but a marble
mourner set upon his tomb. It was out
side of nature that ehe should be so
("till, and I found an interest in watch
ing her that was close to fascination."
This girl is Anna Gregorovna. It's
about the love of her that the story
mainly is, but Fedor has a fascinating
way of telling about it that throws his
personality centrally upon the stage.
The complexities that make tht story
of a many-sided interest are that Lieu
tenant Alexei, to whom Anna is going
and whom she thinks she loves, has al
most forgotten her in three years of
absence and has become enamored of
the half-breed daughter of the com
mander. Baranof; but the Russian law
prevents him from marrying her be
cause she is not of pure white blood.
I-'edor. seeing Alexei weakly wavering
in his choice between the two girls,
falls in love with Anna; the other
g'.rl claims that as she owes nothing to
the 'aw she will keep the love of
Alexei without the sanction of mar
riage: Anna is ignorant of the state
of Alexei's heart, and so for a long
time she has to act her part in puzzled
darkness as to wh*.t it all means.
' This Lieutenant Alexei is one of
Cheney's fine studies of the mixture
of good and evil In human nature. He
is weakly indecisive, but there is. much
in his case to puzzle" the heart, s for he
had not expected that Anna had taken
his youthful engagement seriously. At
the last he goes to a heroic deathâ
swiftly and on a decision taken in
stantly. After that we "cannot wholly
<;-?fplfÂ« the boy , for his perplexities as
a lover. "It- was a splendid death, and
the men who lifted him 'uncovered, rev
Â«reritlv before' they took him out."'
THli SAN FRAXCISCO CALL. SUNDAY. APRIL 9. 1903.
Some of the best-mingled pathos anu
humor of the book is In the telling of a
Russian priest of high ideals of mis
sionary work, but who falls a victim to
the wiles of the native women; an<l
they, being Just simple children of na
ture, saw no harm in what they did.
Here is the way Fedor tells of th?
priests work on a native chief:
"Shakmut still holds out and is with
out the pale. It stirs hisÂ« soul to think
of giving up his wives; but the pope
has been as hard as iron, and without
the sacrifice will not seal him to the
faith. And truly it Is an ordeal more
larsh for this native than for the com
mon man. It is pain enough to a
single wife, and the double loss cannot
bat bring to him a special strain."
A specially fine chapter is the ninth,
where the beauty of Anna's character
is so revealed by her acts that Fedor's
love impulsively declares itself. Perhaps
the best of all the chapters is the dra
matic one in which he prematurely
presses his suit and wherein our lover
says this of his act:
"I cursed myself for having so rough
ly driven matters to a head, but the
will stayed grimly with me to see trie
thing out to the end, and I set myself
to save all the salvage possible from
the wreck of my desire."
Mr. Cheney has told short stories be
fore, but this is his first long one. It
should not be his last, for he possesses
the art of novel writing to a degree
that will make keen the anticipation of
what he will do after practice if this is
only the work of his 'prentice hand.

BENNETT WRITES
OF HEROES OF OLD
Artistic is the first word we think
>>f when we take in hand the very
beautiful new book called "For the
White Christ," a story of the days of
Charlemagne, by Robert Ames Ben
nett, splendidly pictured in colors, each
chapter initialed nicely with a big or
nate letter worth pausing to admire,
and every page richly â¢ decorated with
designs â all this the art work of Mar
garet West Kinney. The cover is at
tractive gray and green, and on it the
image of a fair princess grandly dight
in the gorgeous costume of the heroic
days of old. Each chapter is mottoed
from songs which were sung by the
harpers and skalds before the high
seats of the Norse chiefs. Thus one,
which tells of a fierce and picturesquely
described fight against great odds, puts
us in pulsation with the temper of the
steel-clashing struggle by the music of
this snatch of a Saga battle song:
Thought ahajl bÂ« the harder, heart the keener.
Mood shall toe the more, as our might lessens.
The story is about those renowned
heroes, Roland and Oliver, and so the
world is not yet done singing their
praises and recounting their mighty
deeds. The book opens with a battle
nn the sea, and, behold, Danes, North
men and Franks, in all the terrible
fiercenees and enormous strength with
which history and romance have train
ed our imagination to conceive of them.
There is the excitement and the incen
tive to courage of having on board a
beautiful princess child. The Danes
call upon Thor, the Franks use the bat
tle cry of "Christ and the King"; Ro
land lays about him with his wonderful
and unequaled, save by Oliver, sword
play, until he exhausts himself 'with
one last blow on the helmet of the sea
king. Hroar. Then there is a duel to
the death between the hero Oliver,
whose name the book calls in the ar
chaic way. Olvlr, and the vi-king im
mensely larger but less expert in sword
play. So the story goes with world
famous warriors to stir the blood, with
occasional shift of scenes when prin
cesses, queens and bower girls enter to
play their parts, and love, intrigue and
Jealousy make their addition to the in
terest of this recalling of the days of
old romance.
Around the person of the girl Fas
trada much of the fascination of the
story is conjured up. She is the daugh
ter of a fierce warrior and a woman
reputed to be a sorceress, and Fastrada
has herself much of witchcraft. She is
beautiful, puzzling, enthralling, but
whether shr is a bad or a good woman
Is scarcely fair to the reader to tell him
CALfFORNIAN WHO HAS WRIT
TEN A PRAISEWORTHY NOVEU
AND AN 11-LI'STRATION FROM
ANOTHER BOOK.
at the start. Finding out is part r.f the
fascination of the romance. Olvlr, the
glorious h^ro. loves her at first, but
later he doubts her and his love dies.
The scene of the crisis of this passage
; from love to hate between the once de
voted lovers is dramatically told, and
is chosen for illustration with the besi
picture in the book. The sorceress
mother of the fair Fastrada has pro
phesied that the girl would be mated
with a king, gray of eye. Olvir bears
the message to his betrothed. He Is
neither king, nor gray of eye.
' 'Were she twice your mother,' said
Olvir, 'I'd laugh at such witchery.' But
the girl turned from her lover's smiling
look to ponder the prediction. Later
Olvir hands her a brooch, which she
had dropped. The girl stared fixedly
at the garnets with which it was stud
ded. 'The queen's gems are far more
precious,' she murmured, half aloud.
Then the ire of the sea-king flashed:
My heart held the image of a maiden
pure and true. â¢ â¢ â¢ Love! You
say you love me, when you could stand
for an instant weighing my love
against a queen's crown â love!' The
girl winced and looked appealingly into
his face. Then her own eyes hardened.
The daughter of gray Rudolf was not
one to repay scorn with a smile."
That Is the dramatic moment which
the. picture fixes in our imagination.

American has this one champion who
is persistent in his desire that the
hatred against Burr shall not be fixed
in our national Judgment without the
voice of a friend to try to modify or
avert the verdict of public opinion. A
now historical novel, called "Little
Rurr." has just been issued, it is by
Charles Felton Pidgin, the author of
â¢Blennerhasflett." and he is the man
who Sfems to be fighting almost single
handed against great odds for the re
demption of Burr's name from infamy.
Pidgin has written three books in de
fense of Burr, and expresses an inten
tion of adding to them a life of that
ambitious and talented statesman. Al
though "Little Burr" is the latest writ
ten, it is Intended that it should be read
first of the trilogy on that subject.
"Blennerhassett" is the next in order!
and last comes the "Climax. " The
novel, "Little Burr." gives an account
of the youth of thia rival of Hamilton's
and of his services to the country dur
ing the revolutionary war. He is pic
tured as a most engaging personality,
highly talented, absolutely brave, and
a thorough, soldier. General Montgom
ery, charmed with the splendid courage
of the youth, made him a captain and
placed him on his staff. There is much
in the book, too. about Hamilton, but
the author has no admiration for that
popular Idol, and thinks he maligned
and undermined Burr in a base way.
So much has been written against
Burr and in praise of Hamilton that it
is interesting to get a little of the other
side of the story. ,It is to be remem
bered that, although public opinion con
demns Burr, when he was tried no
verdict could be found against him.
The correspondence between the two
great political rivals just preceding the
fatal duel, when stripped of any parti
san comment by biographers, forms a
pretty good base on which to build a
judgment of the actions and the char
acters of the two antagonists when
face .to face with a crisis in their lives.
Tn this novel of Pidgin's there is this
description of Burrs bearing during the
revolutionary war in a moment of con
test and danger:
"It was not anger that flashed from
those large orbs, nor courage, nor de
termination merely, but all these com
bined: and added to them was a name
iess spell which carried with it an ir
resistible conviction that whatever they
threatened was certain to be performed.
â¢ * there were no chances to be taken.
no wavering, no hesitation to be hoped
for. The man's whole soul was aroused;
all his energif-s were alive and active."
It Is evident from this novel and his
other books that this champion of an
unpopular man believes that these fine
eyes of Burr's were not fiction, but
fact: and that they held Hamilton when
he was face to face with his enemy and
with death, and when Hamilton tried
to meet their gaze he had no nerve left
to aim and flre true.
However, Pidgin will probably soon
have to face the music of rebuke, and
get it in the nick of time, for Gertrude
Atherton is even now at work upon a
story dealing with Aaron Burr, and her
novel, "The Conqueror," proves her to
be a fervent admirer of Hamilton and
a ferocious hater of Burr. The deadly
duel may thus be literarily renewed
even in our generation; and we will be
helped to decide whether Hamilton phil
anthropically fired in the air or whether
he quailed before the eyes of the man
ho was conscious h^had wronged.

TALE OF THE SOUTH
AFTER CIVIL WAR
Plantation life in the bitter days of
reconstruction ts the scene wherein
Harris Dickson places the strong and
In its principal crisis very strange story
of the descendants of a proud race of
Spanish people who became Southern
by settling in Mississippi. The book is
called "The Ravanels," and legend has
it that their ancestor came with De
Soto and was a "knight of Andalusia,
valorous, virtuous and of goodlie dis
cretion in warre." So this transplanted
race flourished as planters and pro
duced men .who fought In all the wars
of their country from the times of In
dian massacres to Appomattox. Their
women were said to be dark and head
strong, and the men seem from the
story to have had the faults of pride,
yet does their describer speak of them
as differing little from their neighbors^ â
"a simple race of men. child-hearted
and sincere, full of headlong passions,
void of mean ambition, careless of gain
and heedful of honor," they were cava
lier Ravanels.
Five Ravanels fought in the Civil
War: only one lived to return to his
plantation; he is killed by a scalawag
in reconstruction days. Claudia, the
grown daughter of the victim, takes
her little brother to the corpse and
placing his finger in the cut in the dead
man's throat says to the child. "Cap
tain Rudd killed him; never forget
that."
No Ravanel could hope for justice
from the courts at that timeâ there was
no trial for the killing. The only thing
for Claudia was to wait till her broth
er grew to manhood. When he did so
the inevitable tragedy came in such a
strange, mysterious, unlooked for way
that it seems as if there must have
been such a blending of evil vindictive
and noble and lovable traits in young
Ravanel that the unseen angels held his
hand from murder, although he never
wavered in the intent to kill on sight
the man who had killed his father.

NOTES OF AUTHORS
AND THEIR BOOKS
"The Story of the Other Wise Man,"
by Dr. Henry Van Dyke, has always
been one of the most popular little
books ever written. As might be ex
pected, a very great number of copies
are sold for Christmas gifts, but the
Harpers say that the Easter sales are
nearly as large. This year. In order
to meet the demand, a. special edition
has: been orenared. in size an oblong
16mo, and attractively bound in white
and gold.
Among books in belles lettree to be
published this season few will take
precedence over Prince Kropotkln's
"Ruesian Literature," announced by
McClure-Phillips for publication early
in April. The book bears a subtitle,
'Idealities and Realities," which shows
the point of view that Prince Kropotkin
has taken toward his subject. The
volume is a complete history of Rus
sian letters from its very beginnings in
folklore and mythology down to the
present day, laying stress upon the
great figures-, such as Pushkin. Gogol,
cte., especially men of recent genera
tions ami of our time, such as Tolstoy,
Dostolevokl, Tourgenleff and Gorki,
with^many of whom Kropotkin wm
personally acquainted.
Early in April the Harpers will pub
lish a book of original and very char
acteristic short stories by Gilbert K.
Chesterton, entitled "The Club of
Queer Trades." This club is an asso
ciation to which only those who have
invented some absolutely novel way
of making a living are eligible. The
strange adventures which befell Basil
Grant, the originator of the club. In
his search for various men of strange
professions deserving the honor of
membership in the society, afford good
material for the effective display of
Mr. Chesterton's gifts of imagination
and humor.
A welcome volume to the increasing
thousands who are interested in the
ethical culture movement will be Dr.
Felix Adler's new volume, "The Reli
gion, of Duty." which is announced by
McClure-Phillips for publication early
in April. The volume gives to the
principles and ideals of the ethical cul
ture movement the most complete and
authoritative exposition that they
have yet had. The leading thoughts
from Dr. Adler's sermons and ad
dresses have been selected arid weld
ed into consecutive essays under such
titles as "First Steps Toward Reli
gion." "'Changes in the Conception of
God," "The Religion of Duty." "The
Ethical Attitude Toward Pleasure."
"The Ethical Attitude Toward Suffer
ing." "The Consolation of the Religion
of Duty." etc.
Miss Harriet Monroe, in an article
on "Literary Women and the Higher
Education" in the April Critic haa
clearly expressed her view that if the
results of such education have not yet
been great it is because the influences
have not been sufficiently extensive.
For the first time tn history the world
as we know it is experimenting on
women's brains, and the change from
the errors of the past to the crude
truths of the present naturally in
volves inconveniences. When these
hindering details disappear the com
bined minds of men and women will
give society a hitherto unknown im
pulse toward the Invisible Intellectual
goal.
Mis. Gertrude Atherton in the Ar
gonaut publishes a letter in which she
expresses her admiration for the
works of Henry James. What Mrs.
Atherion says is so much to the point
that I quote one of her most salient
paragraphs: "His 'boom" has come
at the right moment. Not only has
the public been carefully prepared â
however unwittingly â to reappreciate
him, but psychology is once more the
fashion, and no man so artfully com
bines psychological analysis with the
great gift of the story-teller as Henry
James." â The Critic.
Gorky's gospel is something like
this: We are riveted to the rotten,
and the chief end of life is to know
how to gild the nailheads. We are
battered beatitudes and godless gods.
Our weaknesses are called virtues;
our cringings, tact. Caliban is thrust
into the coal bin while Ariel with sen
se.n breath, reeking in an atmosphere
of mephitic boudoir odors, strums the
"Rock of Ages" on the parlor piano.
We are ruled by an aristocracy of
asses. A pusillanimous and purblind
pietism â wfth a copy of Rabelais se
cretikri unriar his belt â sits in the sad
die. Milk and water is called ether.

There seems to bÂ« a disposition just
now on the part of many readers to
deplore the present popular taste for
books that are without enduring liter
ary qualities. Commenting upon the
subject, a writer in the current
per s Weekly says it ts no new thing
for works that are not classics to find
buyers; it has been going on for many
years. The output of books is much
larger to-day than ever before, ha
says, but so is the output of Jam; and
people buy story-books and books of
entertainment for much the same pur
pose that they buy jam. The writer
goes on to show that the bÂ«st author*
of to-day. Mrs. Ward. Kipling and
Mark Twain among others, are not
lacking In audiences: and that the in
ferior books do not crowd out the
better ones, but merely supplement
them.
The Blue Book of Missions for
1904 was hardly more than a directory
of. American Missionary Societies. Yet
the demand for it was widespread.
Definite suggestions came from China,
from Africa and from England that
*omebody-'ougrht to publish annually
serious year book of missions. It was
natural that these hints of demand
should lead the committee of the Bu
reau of Missions to plan for the issu*
of 1905 a volume of between 200 and
300 pages Instead of a booklet of enve
lope size.
The book contains the essence '<
the Annual Reports (for 1904 > of one
hundred or more missionary societies,
with statistical tables, and with thÂ»
latest facts as to area, population, re
ligions and missions (both Protestant
and Roman Catholic) In each of thÂ«
non-Christian countries of the world.
It also contains a large collection of
miscellaneous Information carefully
indexed for quick reference.

SUNDAY â¢ .....APRIL 9, 1905 "
THE reports of the Agricultural Department bring prominently
forward the kingship oi the American farmer. This day of rest
we sit in church, in' the dim religious light that sprays through
the stained glas^ window, and to-morrow we go to business in the
mercantile palaces of the city and send our commerce to far lands
in great ships. But the temples of religion and of trade, and the
ships that go down to the sea. were all first plowed out of the earth
he farmer.
Last year the farm value of the crops of this country was
00.000.000. The value of the corn crop alone would have paid j
national debt and left a surplus. The value of the food crops
I | six times the capital stock of all the national banks, and
ouble the value of all our foreign trade. When cotton and other i
- crops and livestock and the other secondary products of the |
are added, the sum of value is so vast that "the minds fails to
grasp it. Mines may pinch out, manufactures fail, stock jobbers
pass from affluence to beggary, but king farmer never abdicates,
De^er puts his kingdom under a regency, nor fails in his annual
output.
Without him towns would not be. With the tonnage supplied
him missing no railway could move a wheel. ' He is the dictator.
We have commercial trusts and labor organizations which limit out
put, conjure with prices, smite competition and affect gr^at power
over the financial and commercial destiny of the world. But they are
babes and weaklings compared to what the farmers could do if they
ned a trust and decided that for one season only they would limit
their output to their own necessities, producing no surplus. At the
end of that season there would not be left a solvent bank, railrooad,
st or manufacturing establishment in the whole country. The
unefcial community would disappear and it would be in vain
community life to seek the means of sustenance and profit in the
mines or forest or in the waters under the earth.
When it is known that the farm value of the agricultural products
this country for the last two years is more than the yield of all
the gold mines of the- world since the year 1492, the vast power and
'â >rtance of the farmers and the farms are brought strikingly before
the mind. A labor strike on New York Bay cuts off the supply of
certain foodstuffs for a week, and there is distress. A teamsters' ;
i<e in Chicago excludes butter, milk and eggs for a few days, and 1
re is wailing. Bat a farmers' strike against the production of a
rplus for market would in a month drive employer and employe to !
their own bootheels and live on the broth.
Politicians kow here and tow there to organizations. They take
nd hand from this or that organization. They let in '
1 shot out classes and races of immigrants according to the direc- j
and strength oi the wind that blows ballots. Rut if the farmers j
lid organize and combine their power, where politicians now i
merely bend their knees they would crawl on their bellies. The
farmer is so valuable that States compete for him. In California at
moment we are not striving to lure more merchants, or bankers.
mechanics, or lawyers, doctors or preachers. We are after farm
\\ c are coaxing them from the older States of the East. To '
this end we exploit our climate, the fertility of our soil, the seduc
tions of our scenery. â 
We know that when the farmers come in thousands the mer~ !
chants, bankers, mechanics, lawyers, doctors and preachers will
to without requiring a tourist rate on the railroads to fetch them. ,
The farmer can live without them, but they cannot live without him.
He tnay be a hayseed and chew plug tobacco, but he is king. His
intellectual estate is not below that of the professions. A California
frvrmcr especially is a learned man. He docs not grow field crops
Fruits by hap and by hazard. Others may run business by -'lie
humb. but the farmer is guided by science in the art of agricul
. He is an entomologist, a soil chemist, and knows the functions
of soil and air in the productions of his crops. He builds cities with
plowshare and pruning hook. In war no battle can be won
bout him. in peace no prosperity unless he wills it and coaxes it
the ground.
<ii\e California this year ioo.ooo more farmers, cut up the land
meet their needs, and the State will feel an impulse
greater than can be imparted by the bringing of a hundred millions
at capital. The farmer creates capital. It sprouts with his crops at
dine and is gathered into barns at harvest.
\\e who live in cities and seldom see the fields will do -veil to
k knowledge of this, our king. He is a kindly and sometimes care
- ruler, and we appreciate him but little. Rut if he should turn
tocrat and make a giant's use of his giant power, we would sup
plicate him for mercy. Peace be upon his farmstead, and plenty upon
â ^Ids.
TEAISM AND TAOISM.
TEAISM is taken as a text by the exceedingly clever Japanese
writer. < )kakura-Kakuzo. for one of the brightest bits of hand
he great question of Oriental and Occidental relation-
ship that any recent writer has achieved. Out of the inspirations
born of tea drinking the Japanese have formed a cult called teaism,
led on the adoration of the beautiful. The Taoists claimed this
of the liquid jade'" to be an important ingredient of the elixir
of immortality. Okakura says that teaism is Taoism in disguise. Tea
is the tie that most strongly binds Orient to Occident, for. so far,
unhersally has the heart of humanity met in that exhilarating
cap
There is much of mere play in Okakura's commending to its to
find hemispheric amenities in what he calls the "cup of humanity."
but that in noÂ»way lessens its underlying strength. To get quickly
at the true significance of what he is trying to make us understand,
let us take a single sentence: "The beginning of the twentieth cen
tury would have been spared the spectacle of sanguinary warfare if
Russia had condescended to know Japan better." It would not be
right to object here by saying that Russia drinks tea. She mixes too
much of vodka spirit and of the spirit of vodka with her tea. Tf we
could fully grasp the true spirit of teaism as this brilliant and playful
Japanese idealizes it. we could comprehend how it would tend to
prevent a continuation of the harm which has been done already "by
the mutual misunderstanding of the New World and the Old." In
cidentally it may be mentioned that the ladies should be told, es
pecially the entertainers of diplomats, that Luwuh. the poet who
wrote "The Holy Scripture of Tea." says the color of the cup should
be blue, and thet after the third boiling a little cold water should
be put in the kettle "to restore the youth of the water."
MAY BE A SEA FIGHT.
IF the dove of peace have been cooing around the Straits of
Sunda she would better fly away and be at peace elsewhere, and
five up her place to the stormy petrel. The Russian fleet -.A
forty-seven ships of all kinds is supposed to be trying to break into
the China Sea by that route, and Admiral Togo 'is floating around
â  waiting for it to get within range.
It is a Mngular fact that while the strength of the Russian fleet
if fairly well known, none of the naval experts know the strength in
-hips or guns of the fleet of Togo. There have been reports of the
raiding, repairing and arming of several of the Russian ships that
were sunk around Port Arthur, and of the putting out of commis
- me of the Japanese ships, but there is no certain knowl
edge about these things. The great advantage of Togo lies in the
-Â»erience of his officers and men. They have steamed and fought
for a year, and back of that was their experience in the Chinese
war. when they made rubbish of first-class battleships, though com
a-Jed by German experts. This experience counts fo- much ami
U go far to equalize Toco's strength if his fleet be inferior to that

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. APRIL 9. 1905.
THE CALL PRINTS MORE NEWS THAN
ANY OTHER PAPER IN SAN FRANCISCO
IN justification of the claim that THE CALL prints more news than any
other paper in San Francisco, our readers are invited to a comparison of
the three morning papers, CALL, Chronicle and Examiner, for the week
beginning Sunday, April 2, and concluding with the issue of Saturday, April 8.
During this period The Call published 179, the Chronicle 138 and the
Examiner 73 foreign news items. The Call printed 308 Eastern news items,
the Chronicle 229 and the Examiner 186. The Call printed 388 coast news
kerns, the Chronicle 2JI and the Examiner 136. The Call printed 384 inches
of marine news, the Chronicle 328 and the Examiner 372. Of real estate
news The Call printed 238 inches, the Chronicle 107 and the Examiner 70.
Of society news The Call printed 119 inches, Chronicle 113 and Examiner
83. The Call devoted SO inches of its space to theatrical news, the Chronicle
77 and the Examiner J3. Of labor news The Call printed 27 inches, the
Chronicle overlooked this important matter of news entirely, while the Examiner
devoted 23 inches to the same class of news.
It will be observed from the above figures that The Call leads, with the
Chronicle second, while the Examiner publishes least news of any of the three
morning papers published in San Francisco. The reading public of San Fran
cisco are buying and paying for news and The Call lays claim to their patronage
on the fact, which cannot be controverted, that it publishes more news than
any of its contemporaries, and in a manner which must appeal to the entire
community. The Call's make-up fes superb, and the news is presented in a
manner unsurpassed, while its illustrations are recognized by all as equal to the
best in America. The Call is glad to state that its already large circulation is
being added to rapidly and its largely patronized advertising columns reflect
the high esteem in which it is held as an advertising medium by intelligent
advertisers.

SUPERSTITION AND SPRING LOVE
Before Engagement the Young Maid Is Most Sus
ceptible to Sentimental Fear.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
THE girl who puts a four-leafed
clover in her shoe does it "just
for fun," of course, but she eyes
with interest the first man she
meets thereafter. She who plucks the
petals of a daisy knows there is noth
ing reliable in the response of this
modern oracle, yet she blushes if it
answers as she wants to have it, and
is utterly miserable if it doesn't.
She is mightily pleased if she finds
one fork too many at her place at ta
ble, or if, acting as bridesmaid, she
catches the bride's bouquet. And when
she laughingly refuses to take the last
piece of bread on the plate she is, in
her secret heart, as sincerely afraid
of hoodoo as she was in her days of
frocks and amber beads, when she
would walk for blocks without stepping
on a single crack in the sidewalk;
wiser than her indiscreet ancestress,
Mrs. Eve of Eden park, she does not
care to take any unnecessary chances.
But, note this, it is before her en
gagement that she is most suscepti
ble to this kind of sentimental fear,
which is in its nature essentially fem
inine. Afterward, when her future is
"settled," according to the popular es
timate, she enters Into a new estate of
doubt and dread, very like to that in
which the masculine lover dwells. She
is at the uncertain mercy of the
weather. The wind plays an Aeolian
tune upon her heartstrings.
If she has not seen her fiance since
day before yesterday she may shiver
likp a neurotic child because the sun
goes momentariJy behind a cloud. If
the morning is dark and she has had
a quarrel with him the evening be
fore, she feels as woe-begone as
Tennyson's Mariana of the Moated
Grange. If he has neglected to write

This picture will doubtless prove to be a very popular one. as all fine

The artist has produced a beautiful picture of a lovely child, whose face
is beaming with delight over the wealth of pretty flowers which she has been
gathering and with which her arms are filled. The expression of delight in
the child's face, the natural pose as she holds her great bunch of flowers and
the beautiful form and coloring of the flowers themselves all go to show that
the picture was produced by a master hand.

For my part, I think that unless a
lover deliberately seeks to emulate the
small boy who, at one move, cools off
his summer temperature and enjoys a
squirm by dropping a piece of ice
down his neck, he had better trust
with simple faith the love which he
has received in exchange for the love

TAX ON BACHELORS.
Another one of the surprisingly old
projects that has recently cropped out
again is the proposed tax on bachelors,
says the Cleveland News. The idea is
gray with age and as far as effective
ness in the correction of evils is con
cerned is about as inefficient as it is
old. Bachelors, as candidates or pro
bationers for marriage, have formed
the subject for legislation from the
earliest times. Penalties have often
been imposed on male celibates in va
rious countries. In proportion as the
interests of the state were regarded as
above those of the individual, the en
forcement of marriage was the more
severe. In ancient Sparta it was con
sidered a punishable crime not to mar
ry or to marry too late in life. In
Athens, though not severely punished,
celibacy was discouraged in early
times.
At Rome marriage was fostered by
positive penalties imposed on unmar
ried men and sometimes even on wom
en, as well as by discrimination in
favor of heads of families. In the al
lotment of the Campanian lands by
Julius Caesar portions were given only
to the fathers of three or more chil
dren. Under Augustus a law was en
acted prohibiting unmarried persons
below the age of 60 in men and 50 in
women from taking possession of a
legacy, and this was applied even to
widows, who, in order to secure their
part of their deceased husband's es
tates, wf.re forced to marry again with
in a period of two years.
There arc numerous instances in
Geat Britain of taxes being imposed
upon bachelors and widows, with a
view of increasing revenue, however,
rather than for any other object. In
France, where the question. of depopu
lation has been of such serious moment
as to threaten the very position of the
state among the great powers of Eu
rope, frequent attempts have been
made to Impose taxes on bachelors, but
with little or no success.
TOUCHING GLASSES.
Fred GitE. the Astoria cooper, says:
"In the old country we were brought
up to the habit of touching glasses
with the understanding that to do so
is necessary to complete the round of
the five senses. For instance, in drink
ing a glass of beer, we can see it. taste
it. feel it and smell It, but cannot hear
It. Therefore, to reach the other sense,
that of hearing, we make the clink." â
New York Press.
HIS USUAL STUNT.
"I>ear." said the melancholy wife. "If
you die first you will wait for me there
on that far shore, won't you?"
"1 guess so," replied her husband,
wearily. "I've always had to wait for
you everywhere I go."â Philadelphia
Press.
AN OPTIMIST.
"Yes. sir," said the Blllville citizen,
"the hurricane blowed his house down,
but the weather was mighty cold, and
Providence was good to him after all."
"How do you figure that out?"
"Well, his house was split to kindlin'
wood, all ready to burn, an' he made a
big fire an' shouted 'Halleluia! 1 "âAt

AN ANGEL
UNAWARES
KATE M. CLEARY
THE April downpour was at its
fiercest when the knock came to
the kitchen door. It was a timid
knockâ so timid that Nan stood
with knife suspended over the pan of
apples she was paring, thinking her im
agination might have played her a
trick. It came again â low, entreating.
The girl crossed to the door and
opened it.
"Good land!" she cried. "Come in!
You poor little soul, whoever you are.
come in!" And out of the blinding
rain she caught the little black, shrink
ing figure and whirled it into the
warmth and spicy scent of the big
kitchen .
She stood and looked at her unex
pected visitor, her gaze a curious
blending of amazement and compas
sion. Such a frail, old figure of a
woman! The plain black cashmere
gown, the thin shawl, the close little
bonnet, all were dripping rain, from
the stiff Jet spirals ornamenting the
bonnet to the hem of the poor skirt.
And the face that looked up at Nan,
dumb and beseeching, was childishly
pathetic in Its wistfulness. The woman
held a worn bag clutched In one hand.
"I," faltered the stranger deprecat
ingly, 'I got caught in the rain!"
Nan threw back her head and.
laughed a girlish laugh, crisp and in
fectious, and the shriveled countenance
of the intruder relaxed into a smile.
"Pardon me," cried Nan, controlling
i herself. "Only it was so evident you
had not been under shelter the last
hour that I couldn't help laughing.
Here, sit down in this rocker near the
stove!" She deftly unpinned the soak
ting shawl and removed the pulpy bon
net. "Dear, dear!" she exclaimed,
"you've no rubbers on: And your feet
are dripping! You're just a bundle of
wetness! Whatever will I do with
you?"
She spoke with the air of solicitude
she might have used toward a child.
Nan was only 17, but she had many
burdens on her shoulders, and she bore
them with courage. A year ago when
she had graduated from the high
school, the hope that she might go
to college was strong within her. But
her aunt and cousin had condemned
her desire and derided her ambition.
There was no money to spare for such
foolishness! There was work to oe
done at home!
The latter fact the girl was given no
opportunity to doubt. The maid of all
â work had been dismissed the week of
her graduation, and Nan had been in
stalled in her place. And silently, but
with fierce inward rebellion, she ac
cepted her duties. But her father had
been a man of letters, and a professor
in a university, and she had inherited
his love of learning. So it was with
a heavy heart she saw the days slip
ping by and with them the time she
would fain have given to the acquire
ment of further knowledge. To-day
many bidden tasks still remained to be
accomplished, and here was this for
lorn creature on her hands!
"I'm sure I'm sorry to be making
you trouble, my dear," piped up the
plaintive old voice. "If when after I'm
rested a bit you'll be telling me my
direction, I'll be moving on."
But suddenly she went ghastly white.
She caught her hand sharply to her
side, and her lips turned blue.
"Here." cried Nan. "take this!" She
had gone for a stimulant, and was
back, holding it pressed to the twitch
in? mouth. The old woman swallowed
.the liquor, and tried to rise.
"Sit still!" commanded Nan. "You're
111: you mustn't stir!"
Nan stood before her. tall and slen
der in her blue cotton gown, with a big
white apron belted in at her waist.
Tho pure pallor of her skin was ac
cented by the blackness of her brows
and lashes. Her gray eyes were wide
with perplexity.
â¢Walt a minute!" she ordered, and
went flashing up the back stairs. She
reappeared with a load of, garments
over her arm. "You're such a mite of
a thing the clothes that I've outgrown
will fit you." she said. "Your bag?
Here it is â safe behind you! There!"
She worked rapidly as she talked.
"Now you're dry and comfortable any
how. If you do look funny."
The old woman smiled up at her
gratefully. She did look funny in the
schoolgirl gown of red. But the color
had come Into her cheeks, and her
chilled feet were growing warm in the
dry stockings and slippers.
"Now. 11l make you some tea and
toast." declared Nan. hanging the wet
clothes to dry. "And then I must get
back to â good gracious, my cake is
burning!"
She was on her knees in a minute
and had snatched the oven door wide
open. A smoking, blackened mound
confronted her. And. as ill luck would
have it. at that very 1 moment Helena
Burnet, her cousin, and mistress of the
house owing to the invalidism of Mrs.
Burnet, came sailing Into the kitchen.
"What's this?" she cried sharply. She
was In street attire, but had been well
protected from the storm. "Your cake
ruined! And that â who is that per
son"-
Her cheeks scarlet from embarrass
ment the heat of the oven. Nan
was hastily removing the cake.
"She's an old lady who got caught in
the shower." the girl explained ner
vously. "Did Aunt Ellen come, Hel
ena?"
"No, she didn't!" snapped Helena.
"I've waited in that draughty depot
until I am nearly sick. I suppose you
made that chicken broth the way
mother says she used to like it?"
"Yes, and the little honey hearts,
too."
"You've got the spare room all
ready. I dare say?"
"Yes. It's clean, and I lit the fire
half an hour ago."
"Such a lot of trouble and expense to
go to for a foolish old woman," grum
bled Miss Burnet. "Mother says she al
ways had as little sense as the law al
lows. But that doesn't alter the fact
that she is coming to spend her few re
maining years with us and that shÂ»
has $60,000 to leave. I suppose she will
land here to-morrow, and we'll have
this bother all over again. Well. 11l
spend a hundred dollars on mourning
for her when I inherit it!"
"She will never leave me anything,"
averred Nanqy Goodwin. "My mother
did not marry to please her, and Aunt
Ellen never forgave her. But â " brisk
ly buttering some fresh toastâ "if she
I "And thatâ who Is that per
son?"
ever were to remember me, Fflâ "
"Go to college. I presume!" ended
Helena contemptuously.
"Yes, that I would!" rejoined Nan
resolutely. "There's no hope of that, "
she sighed. "Now. try to eat a few
mouthfuls of this and drinlj your tea. "
Helena stared from her cousin to the
strange guest and back again.
"Do you mean to say you've gone out
of your head, wasting good food on a
tramp?" she shrieked.
"Hush!" begged Nan. trembling with
mortification. "You will hurt her feel-
Ings."
"Feelings, indeed!" She glared at the
stranger. "The rain is over now. She
can go about har business."
Nan stood before her cousin.
"She is sick and cold. She can't go
out of the house to-night. Let her sleep
In my bed. I'll make up a shakedown
on the cot." Then, hurriedly, as she
saw angry refusal in the other's eyes.
"Don't make me leave you, if you value
my work!"
"What do you mean?"
"Only that Mrs. Hunter across the
street has offered me $10 a week as
housekeeper In her home. I would have
no more labor there than here, where I
am paid nothing. And I shall accept
her offer to-day if you make me turn
this poor old creature out!"
â¢ Well. I declare!" ejaculated Miss
Burnet. But aware that Nan wu quite
capable of doing what she threatened
she made a tempestuous exit from the
kitchen. Overcoming her apologetic
objections. Nan assisted the old wo
man up the stairs. On the second Ho<>r
they passed a bright room, hung with
rosy chintzes, with a Jolly flre rollick
ing in the grate.
"I wish I might take yera in there."
she whispered "But that is intended
for Mrs. Franklyn, who is coming to
stay here. You shall have her chickan
broth, though." said the girl determin
edly. "She can't need It any more than
you do."
And when she had tucked the feeble
body into her own narrow bed she
brought the chicken broth. But thai
ni^nt when the dishes were washed the
girl climbed to her room. She found
her protege very ill. She was feverish
and the pain in her side was worse.
Occasionally shÂ« lapsed into delirium.
Nan was frightened, and. as the wo
man grÂ°\v worse, she sped down the
stairs and across the street for Dr.
Meeker.
"Pneumonia." he said. "Exposure,
eh? I thought so. Practically hope
less. What's that, ch 1 * You want a
lawyer?" He bent to listen. "Poor
â¢oul. xvhat have you to will?"
"John Meeker." she panted, "don't
you know me?"
"I'm young Dr. Meeker. John Meeker
is my father. I'm trying to be as
a man. If I can build up his practice
that had fallen off I hope to make -i
home for this little girl here."
The nld woman smiled and nodded.
"You'll get me a lawyer, maybe, if
yoi know that I am Ellen Franklyn
No' Don't call the others. Helena is
llkp her mother â cold and selfish. I
heard hÂ°r for 7Tiyself tÂ«>-day."
The physician did what he could
and hastened away. His experienced
eye told him she had been ill several
days and that the exposure of the
afternoon was hastening the climax
The lawyer returned with him. and
the household was aroused. The old
woman chuckled, exhausted, but tri
umphant as she fell back after signing
the will.
"I've left Helena $100 to buy that
mourning 9he was so set on!" she
whispered. "You can get your learn
ing whilst he's making the home f-Â«r
you. "Twas the fine fellow his father
was. I mind well!"
And not all the wrath or lamenta
tions of Helena Burnet and her mother
availed to impeach the validity of the
will, which left the property of Ellen
Franklyn to Nancy Goodwin.
"I shan't hold you to your promise
now, dear," Charlie Meeker said, when
he came to see the girl off to the uni
versity. "You arÂ» an heiress now.
Everything is different."
"That isn't different !" she replied
with emphasis. "You loved nyÂ» when
I was a common drudge. You mustn't
stop loving me now that I am going
to fit myself to be a wife of whom you
may be proud."
He smiled down at her.
"My dear, my dear." he said, "a
prince might be proud of you! Here'a
the train!"

OF PREJUDICE
Maestretti's Attorneys File
Motion to Set Aside Indict
ment as Was Expected
BIAS IS MAIN UKOIXD
Members of Grand Jury to
Be Summoned as Wit
nesses at Hearing in Court
The case of Frank A. Maestretti,
president of the Board of Public Works,
who was indfeted by the Grand Jury
f^r subornation of perjury, was called
in Judge Lawlor's court yesterday that
the defendant might plead. Attorney
Dibble, on behalf of ex-Governor Budd,
counsel for the defendant, filed a mo
tion to sÂ»>t aside the indictment, and ar
gument on the motion was set for to
morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.
The principal ground advanced for the
motion is that there exists good cause
for a challenge of the panel of the
Grand Jury and the individual mem
bers because at the time of filing the
indictment they were in a state of mind
that piejudiced them against the de
fendant and prevented them from act
ing impartially and with due regard to
the substantial rights of the defend
ant, objection is also made to the fact
that the Grand Jury appointed a com
mittee to interview persons outside that
body, and that persons were perimtted
to be present at the sessions who were
not privileged or entitled to be present.
The members of the Grand Jury will
be summoned to be present in court to
morrow afternoon to give their testi
mony in regard to the acts alleged in
the motion.
The case of Policeman W. I. Burns,
indicted for perjury committed while
testifying for the defense at the trial of
Charles Wyman, the convicted ballot
box stuffer. was yesterday set for trial
on May 8 before a jury in Judge Law

ADULTERATION OF
CALIFORNIA WINES
President of California Wine Associa
tion Addressee Chronicle
on the Subject.
San Francisco. Cal.. April 8. 1905.
Tr> the Managing Editor, San Francisco
Chronicle â Dear Sir:
Referring to an article In your is
sue of last Friday concerning the
adulteration of California wines, and
the statement therein that the Health
Officer says "that the condemned
wines are being traced to the big
firms and wine associations." I de
sire to publish, as president of the Cali
fornia AVine Association, which is the
largest dealer in native wines upon the
Pacific Coast, that this corporation has
for several year 6 maintained, at great
expense, a complete laboratory for the
analysis <<f all wines which may come
into its possession, and that previous to
offering any wines for sale in this city
Baxnplefl thereof are analyzed so as to ln
sure their absolute purity to the con
sumer. Our head chemist is. in ability
to make a correct analysis of wine, sec
ond, probably, to no one in this State,
and the efforts which the association
has made 10 secure the purity of Califoi-
nia wines are well known to -the authori
ties at Washington. Dr. Harvey Wiley,
one of the greatest exponents of pure
food regulations in the l'nited - States,
can teslify to the measures which the
California Wine Association has always
taken to secure purity In the native pro
duct. The California Wine Asociation
unreservedly guarantees the purity of.
the wines which it sells, and no Board ol
Health or health official or chemist can
show that one gallon of wine has been
sold by the association in this city which
was not absolutely pure. Its cellars are
open to any investigation. Samples of
any of the wines it is selling may be pro
cured at our cellars by any person who is
interested and taken to any chemist of
good standing to be analyzed.

CITY RENTALS
LIE UNCLAIMED
Municipal Officials Failed
to Collect Tidy Sum
From Tenants, Expert Says
WILL HELP GKAXD JURY
Police Commissioners and
Chief Dinan Will Assist
Closing Poolroome
An example of careless city book
keeping of the present administration
was brought to light yesterday by
Douglas Young, the expert employed
by the Grand Jury to examine the
books of the various municipal de
partments. He reports that T. Ter
moti of 524 Pine street and J. Taka
yama of 19, 21 and 23 St. Mary's
street occupy city property and have
paid regularly to the agents, Bovee,
Toy & Co., for rentals and repairs,
$649.
Bovee. Toy & Co. were the agents
before the city purchased the property
and continued to collect the rents after
the city assumed ownership, since June
1, 1904. The sum collected was placed
to the credit of Mayor Schmitz. repre
senting the city. John T. Harmes of.
Madison & Burke called yesterday for
the money on behalf of Mayor Schmitz.
It was paid to him by Bovee. Toy & Co.
Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury. District Attorney Byington and
Police Commissioners Poheim and
O'Grady were in conference yester
day, the outcome of which was that
the Commissioners promised that the
board would do all in its power to aid
in the suppression of the poolrooms.
Chief Dinan was also consulted and
promised to instruct his men to break
up the sidewalk pooteelling by order
ing the patrolmen to keep the men
moving.
In connection with the successful at
tempt that the Grand Jury made to
close the poolrooms, it Is said that Zick
Abrams, who has been one of the prin
cipal figures in the case, is ready to
"quit." It is said that his attorney,
Michaels, rushed into the District At
torney's office a few days ago and an
nounced that Abrams had had enough.
He aaid Abrams had closed his shop
and wag going into legitimate business
and asked that if in that event the
present charges would be pushed. By
ington's response to the query was a
bland smile.

ing such wires be granted the same
extension of time for this work as
was granted 10 companies maintain
ing light and power wires to place
their wires in District No. 4 under
ground, namely, until March 1, 1906.
Chief Hewitt of the Department of
Electricity has sent to the Supervis
ors copies of correspondence which
passed between him and General
Manager Jaynes of the Western Union
Telegrraph Company in March and
April of last year. On March 30,
15*05, Hewitt notified Jaynes that he
would be pleased to have him apply
to the Supervisors for a permit to
stretch wires across streets for tele
graph, burglar alarm and clock ser
vice, for which no franchise or permit
was granted. In reply Jaynes wrote
on April 3. 1905, that <the company
had no occasion to apply for a permit
and did not desire any privilege which
is not granted by Existing ordinances.
Hewitt asked the Supervisors what is
necessary to be done in the premises
and will take no action until so ad
vised.

SAYS STREETS ARE SWEPT
BirrTKR THAN EVER BKFOKK
Secretary of Works Board Issues
Statement of Work Done During
lisc-al Year.
Secretary Louis Levy of the Board
of Works yesterday issued a statement
purporting to show that the street?
are kept in a cleaner condition than
heretofore. According to Superintend
ent Cowden, 324.595.922 yards were
swept in 1904, whereas in 1905 50.000
yards more were swept. Th â¢ city has
the advantage of clean streets in vari
ous sections owing to the inauguration
of the all-day system. More than five
miles of newly paved streets have
never been swept owing to the insuf
ficiency of the appropriation, and fif
teen miles of newly paved streets have
been added to the schedule since the
work has been done by contract. An
appropriation of at lea?t $271.61)5 must
be made for the next fiscal year for
cleaning the streets, urges the secre
tary. The erection of stables and pur
chase of additional street-sweeping
machines and other equipment will be
recommended by the Board of Works.
Not Lodge of that branch of the order
is composed of Mrs. Milcah Bain. Mrs.
Sadie Spencer, Mrs. Dora H. Wilkins,
Miss Ethel G. Farley and Mrs. Ida F.
Greene. The other lodges that are to
assist are Silver Spray and Carnation.
Reports from the several loiges of
the Workmen show that the member
ship generally is taking an active in
ln the bazaar.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 9, 1905.
BUILDING PROJECTS ASSIST
TO GIVE MARKET STABILITY
BROKERS' REPORTS TELL OF GOOD PRICES
A large amount of building that is
projected is one of the features of the
present situation in the realty market,
and this and an increased demand for
good renting properties tend to keep
values steady and to increase them at
a reasonable pace. The largest single
improvement is the large addition to be
made to the St. Francis Hotel, which
has been mentioned before. Structures
costing $50,000 each are quite common.
Borne contracts have been let for the
addition to the St. Francis. That so
large a hotel added to the previously
large hotel accommodations of San
Francisco should be enlarged so soon
after construction, for the reason that
it is unable to accommodate all those
who apply, is significant of the general
trend of this city toward greatness in
size and prosperity. Concerning the
sales of the week reports are made by
the local brokers, who also mention in
many instances the prices that were
paid for properties.
Lyon & Hoag. as agents, have closed
an agreement for James C. Jordan by
which the San Francisco Suburban
Home Building Society buys on both
sides of Jordan avenue, between Point
Lobos avenue and California street, a
frontage of 2750 feet, the value of which
:.- near $200,000. It is stipulated that the
entire frontage shall be built up within
two years with structures on lots of no
less than 33:4 feet front, the residences
to be set bark a uniform distance of
twelve feet from the street line and
with a space of seven feet between
houses. To give Jordan avtnu a park
like appearance palms viU be set out on
the outside of the pavements and lawns
will be planted on the inside. This will
be of large benefit to the Richmond dis
trict.

POLICE SAY PIETRO TORTURITI MURDERED VILARDO
FINDING OF BLOODY CLEAVER IS FOLLOWED BY THE ARREST OF SUSPECT'S WIFE AND THREE MEN
Biaggio Vilardo was murdered at 736 1-2 A Green street. The police are certain that he was killed by Pietro Torturiti, another Sicilian, and have arrested Tar
; beautiful wife on suspicion that she was an accomplice. It is believed that her beauty was employed to lure Vilardo to the place selected by plotters for the
taking of his life. A shred of flesh was found on an apron of hers. Three other suspects are held. Chief of Police Dinan declares he will stamp out the Mafia.

Eiaggio Vilardo wre murdered in a
little room at 736V4A Green street. Pietro
Torturiti, a fellow Sicilian and can
maker by occupation. \% the murderer.
He iÂ£ still at large, and every energj
of the Police Department is bended in
the hunt for him.
"With her five-month-old baby in her
arms, the pretty wife of Torturiti is
held on suspicion of being implicated
In the awful crime. The police are cer
ihat she employed her beauty to
decoy the victim to the place where
her huEbatid might carry out his mur
derous purpose.
'â t Dinan If in possession of infor-
r >n that Turturiti had announced
that he would kill Vilardu when he got
him to Green street because he had
been too attentive to Mrs. Torturiti.
igh thp woman denies that sh*
nything about the murder, it
: tain that she does. Captain Bur
erwn goes further. He thinks that
ehe may have seen it committed, A
â i -spattered apron, upon which a
bit <_-f human flesh was glued, was
d In the house.
The plac-r â  hue liiaggio Vilardo was
.ed to pieces was located yester
day. There was found absolute proof
that it was Pietro Torturiti, sometimes
known as Pete Torchi, who wielded
th* cleaver.
Viiardo was butchered in the front
room of the lower floor of the little
house at TSC^fcA Green street, not much
over a block from where the mutilated
trunk was found. The murdered man
h&d lived there with Torturiti and his
comely young Italian wife.
ThÂ» woman was found by the de
tectives Just after dawn, when 6he was
returning from an all-night visit to
some place that she refuses to divulge.
The police believe that she was coming
back frdm the hiding place of her hus
band.
Captain Burnett and all the detec
tives are certain that the woman par
ticipated in the plot. They believe that
ehe uÂ»ed her comeliness to lure Vilardo
to leave his former lodgings at 711
Montgomery avenue that her husband
might carry out his diabolical con
spiracy.
It was the work of a secret Sicilian
the police assert.
Besides the woman, four others have
been arrested and are held in the tanks
at the City prison. They are Rosirio
l>omlna. Fippo Fretitta, Salvatore Ma
randa. and Sam Possofumi. All of
these are Sicilians and were identified

nrdo tmÂ» c.
FRETTCTA GIVES CLEW.
I The clew that led to the discovery
of the place where . the murder was
committed was obtained through Fre
tltta, the landlord of the premises at
710 'Montgomery avenue, where the
Tcrturftis and Vilardo had formerly
livtnT together. He told the detectives
that the trio had moved to some place
on Gre*Â»n street, near Mason.
Detectives Tom Gibson, Ed Gibson
and Wren immediately started out on
gaining this information, and located
the house an h'>ur before dawn. They
entered It through a rear door and with
. porket lanterns explored it thoroughly.
When the detectives arrived at the
front room . they noticed .a . dark blur
on the wall â  hat was partly concealed
by a coat of kalsomine. Underneath
'was â  wide, dark stain that could not
be washed away. It was human blood.
Hastily the detectives moved through
the house of crime, looking into every
corner. Finally Detective Ed Gibson
found the cleaver stowed beneath a
*ink in the kitchen at the rear of the
house. It had been washed and care

TORTURITI 'S WIFE SEEN TO ENTER HOUSE OF DEATH
TWICE AFTER MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED.
E. Zitzka Says He Watched the Woman as She Opened and Shut
Door Behind Her on Thursday and Friday Mornings.
An all Important clew to the possible
capture of the murderer of Vilardo was
turned up last night when it was dis
covered that Mrs. Rosa Torturiti, wife
of the man for whom the police are
scouring the town, paid two visits to
the house of death on Green street on
the morninr-- of Thursday and Friday
notwithstanding her statement that she
left the house early Thursday morning
and did not return yesterday. She was
seen by E. Zitzka. landlord of the
house, who resides in the upper fiat.
Although the woman denies absolute
ly having visited the place till she was
FIFTY-TWO PAGESâ SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, APRIL 9, 1905â PAGES 25 TO 38.
captured there yesterday morning, the
landlord is prepared to swear he saw
her and that she acted In a suspicious
manner, as though she feared some
thing. Each time she carried a bundle
and each time she remained in the
house for some length of time.
It Is the opinion of the landlord that
the woman had Just left her husband
on each occasion and that he dis
patched her to the house where the
dismembered remains lay for the pur
pose of scouting around and seeing that
there was no one who suspected that
a crime had been committed la the
neighborhood.
"That woman came to the house on
Thursday and Friday mornings about
7 o'clock." said Zitzka last night, "and
I am not making a mistake when I say
this, for I know her well. Each time
she carried a bundle with her and she
acted In a very Busplclous manner. She
remained in the house for some length
of time and left the place hurriedly.
WOMAN IS STARTLED.

Friday morning, when I saw her en
tering the place. She looked up in a

Her Charms May Have Been Employed to
Lure the Unfortunate Sicilian Laborer
to Place of Butchery.
She Is Held in City Prison With Her Infant,
but Sullenly Denies That She Knows
Anything of the Murder.
A particle of human flesh found
upon a gingham apron may prove to
be a link connecting Mrs. Torturiti
with the crime her husband so fiend
ishly committed.
During the search for evidence in
the murderer's home yesterday De
tective Charles Taylor discovered a
woman's apron hidden away In the
corner of the bedroom. The detec
tive took the apron to the light to see
if he could find any blood on it. He
was about to cast the apron to one
side when he was startled by the dis
covery of a small particle of human
flesh and a blood scatter. The detec
tive carefully removed the flesh from
the apron and preserved it In a bottle
of alcohol. It was given to the City
Chemist for analysis. Closer search
of the apron was made and more
traces of blood were found
This ghastly clew leads the police to
believe that the woman helped to
clear away the evidence of the crime
and* that she was imolicated in it as
deeply as her husband.
The woman whose beauty is be
lieved to have lured the unfortunate
Vilardo to his terrible death fs held
at the City Prison. She Is scarcely
more than a girl and as she sat with
her pretty baby in her arms might
have been a study for Madonna and
Child but for the dogged sullenness
of her expression.
She shrank from every glance and
lowered her head when spoken to.

Whenever the child became fretful
she soothed it mechanically.
"I do not understand," she mut
tered whenever a pertinent question
was asked.
In face and feature she is a true
daughter of Sicily, the land of the
Mafia. Her wealth of hair is black,
and her eyes are brown as berries. At
times the^e is a flush in them that
shows the daughter of a race that does
not blanch at the sight of human
blood.
She would be regarded a beauty
among men of the character of Vilardo
and the suspects that were arrested
yesterday. If the scowl that now seems
stamped upon her face were removed,
it would be easily seen how her smiles
might win a man like the victim.
"Where were you last night?" was
asked.
"I do not understand."
"Didn't you see the blood in the
room?"
"I do not understand."
It was the same monotonous answer
to every questionâ "l do not under
stand."
The woman had evidently been
coached by her husband. The expres
sion on her face reads plainly, "You
will get nothing out of me." There is
a defiance in it. Never yet has there
been a case where the Mafia's agents
were betrayed by their brethren. That

I believe the murder of

The Police Department is much

at once to stamp out the savage band.

Chief of Police Dinan and is to begin
at once. There will lwÂ» no cessation ot
effort, he announces, until evÂ»ry mem

Detectives familiar with the Lat;n
quarter and having a knowledge of the
various tongues spoken there will be
detailed for the work. Threat* of as
sassination that have thrown Little
Italy into a state of terror will noc
avail against the police.
Chief Dinan in discussing the matter
last night said that It was his intention
after a consultation with Captain of
Detectives Burnett to take steps to root
the Mafia out in short order. Severai

of the detectives will be kept a secret
so as to facilitate their work.26
MURDER MYSTERY NEARING SOLUTION
TRACE CRIME
TO THE MAFIA
Police Convinced Thaf Room in Rear of
a Mason-Street Fish Market Was
Murderers' Rendezvous
The murder of Vilardo was the work
M organized gang and the result of
a deep-laid plot. That is the theory of
the detectives, for within the last twen
ty-four hours developments that tend
to show the plotting^ of the dreaded
â¢ Black Hand" have come to light. One
of the meeting places of the band is lo
cated oh Mason street, opposite the
barber shot of Jose Raia, where Bro
gardo was murdered last January.
Tht^ rendezvous is a small room back
of the fish market of Antoni Lapoli,
and in this place men have been wont
to gather and conspire for many
months past. But, strange to say,
i he remain* of Vilardo were dis
ed the nightly meetings of the
plotters have ceased and none of them
have been seen in their accustomed
/launtF.
the night that Brogardo was shot
n: hie tracke a meeting had been
held in the back room of the flsh mar
ket and a wild orgy followed. A fight
had evidently taken place there, and
the theory is that the men plotted to
take the life of Brogaido that very
night, and when the opportunity of
be deed was done.
Fretitta. Maranda, Rosario Domina
and Sam Possofumi, men now held
under suspicion by the police, have
been known to frequent that place. In
fan. they were prominent members of
the g&ng that congregated there. They
were also regarded as friends of Bro
gard< . but Just what their relations
wore with Vilardo has not yet been
learned.
â¢ Â»n Tuesday night, the evening before
the mangled trunk of the Sicilian was
found on Vallejo street, the gang had a
late session in the back room of the
fish market. Sounds of loud talking
could be distinctly heard on the street
by persons in the neighborhood. The
plotters did not disperse till an early
hour ii: the morning, and then they
slunk stealthily away, as has been their
vÂ«Â«nt.
The police firmly believe now that the
murder of Viiardo was planned in this
place. Suspicions have been made
Ftronger by the fact that the conspira
tors ceased to meet since the murder
of Vilardo.
"Whether this pans is the real Mafia
or not remains to be proved. All the
â¢<=tf are Sicilians, and It is said
that they belong to another band, the
name of which is not known. The
headquarters of this society is in Paler
mo. Sicily, and the orders are issued
â¢;at place.
The mandates come direct from the
i-nt. who ie not known to any of
the members outside of a secret coun
cil in the mother country. The society
is said to he more cruel in its purposes
thaÃ the dreaded Mafia, and when a
man is ordered killed hie doom is
sealed, for he will be followed to the

No one has yet been found who can
swear positively that he ever saw
Vilardo enter the place. It is rumored,
however, that he was a member of the
society and frequently attended these
nightly sessions. The members always
entered the rendezvous one by one
through a small back door so as not to
be observed. When the meetings broke
up the members dispersed in the same
tray. Unless one were familiar with
the workings of the society it would
be almost impossible to discover that a
meeting was in progress.
WORKED IN ALAMEDA.
Vilardo Was Employed by the Light
Company In That City.
OAKLAND, April S. â Biaggio Vil
ardo was formerly employed by the
Oakland Gas, Light and Heat Com
pany in this city and while here be
came a warm friend of Frank Gordo,
a Portuguese employed by the same
company. Vilardo was unable to
speak English and ft was through
Gordo that he secured his position.
Vilardo's former employers speak well
of him and among the men with
whom he worked^he has the reputa
tion of being a hard and willing
worker.
Viiardo was in the employ of the
iight company when Giuseppe Bro
gardo was murdered in San Francis
co, and shortly after the murder he
spoke of ihe case to his friend, Frank
Gordo. Gordo told the following
etory of the conversation to-day:
"Vilardo could speak no English,
and he used to talk to me a great
deal, as I sneak some Italian. When
Brogardo was killed $n San Francisco
Vilardo told me that he would hay
to bury him. and he faid that he had
only been able to get S2O toward the
funeral expenses. He did not say that
he feared he would incur the enmity
of Brogardos foes by taking charge
of the funeral, nor did he express any
lear that he would be killed by the
Mafia because of his act."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 9, 1905.
BELIEVE TORTURITI
IS HIDING HERE.
Sleuths Are Scouring City
Suspect Murderer's Wife Is
Trying to Shield Him.
Detectives are still scouring the city
i and its outlying districts with the hope
| of apprehending the murderer of Biag
i glo Vilardo. Captain Burnett and Chief
IMnan do not believe that Pietro Tortu
! i-lti has left the city. They have learn
i ed that the murderer is without funds.
i It is regarded as certain that Torturiti
j was not the oriiy one concerned in the
murder.
"I do not believe much of the story
j told me by Rosa Torluriti," said Cap
| tain Burnett last night. "She is con
i cealing many facts from us and I think
j that she knows where her husband is
;at this tfme. 1 believe that if she was
| not a participant in the murder that
; she was a witness and assisted in
j cleaning up the evidence of the crime.
"We have caught her in many lies
! and there are discrepancies in her
' story. Whenever a question is asked
; her that would tend to elicit any infor
mation as to the method of the murder
| or her connection -with it, she shrugs
i her shoulders and refuses to talk. I be
â¢ lieve that we will have the murderer in
I custody before long. 'The murder may
: have arisen through a quarrel between
the murderer and his victim over Tor
turiti's wife."
Many theories prevail among the de
; tectives working on the case. It is be
i lieved by some that Torturiti is at this
j time some distance from the city, aided
| and hidden by his friends who were the !
j partners in the bloody deed. otherÃ
. cling to the theory that he is still in the
j Laiin quarter, where they say he is
; .safe for a time from detection, on ac-
J count of the fear that possesses the
: Italian and Sicilian inhabitants of that
portion of the city.
Another thing that shows that the
I woman is protecting her husband is the
; statement of Detective Nick Bakulich,
who aided in the house-to-house search
| on the morning of the discovery uf the
bloody trunk at Vallejo and Powell
streets. Among the houses visited by
Bakulich was the Torturiti home, at I
TSe^A Green street. Bakulich showed
Kosa Torturiti the shawl and blanket
in which the dismembered corpse was
I wrapped and she promptly denied ever
I having seen them before.
The organization that promoted the
killing Of Vilardo has probably raised
j enough money to get Torturiti out of
town. It is known that members of the
Police Department are watching the
suburb haunts of the Italian and Sicil
ian races, in the hope of apprehending
the murderer.
REMOVK GHASTLY EVIDENCE.
Detectives Relieve Cireen-Street House
of Blood-Stained Relics.
The crowd of cu/ious shifted its
gathering plnce from the Morgue to
the scene of the crime at 7 36% A Green
street yesterday. Hardly had the news
been given out that the place where
the murder was committed had been
discovered when several hundred per
sons gathered around the house. The
report spread like wildfire and early
in the morning Green street was black
with a. craning mob.
The house- is but a few doors from
the corner of Mason street. The land
lord, Becker, with his mother, niece
and son, lives in the two upper floors,
while the ground floor was occupied
by the Toruritis and Vilardo.
Every one of the four rooms where
Vilardo met his horrible death waa
ransacked by the detectives in their
search for evidence.
The police stationed on the outside
of the house were kept busy keeping
the crowd back and ejecting those who
had no authority to enter the premises.
Detectives Taylor and Harrison gath
ered together what there was in the
house to be taken to the station for
use as evidence. Particular attention
was given to any article that showed
traces of blood and every article of ap
parel was closely examined.
One of" the most startling discoveries
during the day waa that of a woman's
apron found in the bedroom of the
Toruritis. A small particle of hu
man flesh was detected on it. The
flesh was placed in a bottle of alcohol
arid will be analyzed.
The blood-besnattered wall of the
supposedly unoccupied room where the
crime was committed was carefully
examined. Though the murderer tried
to hide air evidence of the foul deed, a
glance into the room told that a hor
rible slaughter had taken place. The
bloody floor, which had been thor
oughly washed, could not be cleansed
of its crimson color. The imprints of a
blood-stained hand could plainly be
seen. Specks of blood were also plain
on the ceiling, which is about ten feet
above the floor. There were s>iots of
blood on the wall and on the door of
the victim's room.
Every article of the victim's ap
parel was carted in the patrol wagon
to the Hall of Justice. The remainder
of the stuff found in the house will be
taken away later.
In the afternoon the crowd about
the house was largely augmented.
There was much pushing and jostling
to get to the front for a good view.
Stairways and windows in the neigh
borhood that would afford a view
point were sought. When the patrol
wagon left the scene with its load of
evidence a crowd followed to the hall
and struggled desperately to witness
the unloading.

of the date of the murder.
The detectives postponed a more
minute inspection of the premises,
thinking that there was a chance of
somebody's returning. They hid
themselves in a rear room and waited.
Just as the first light of dawn
streamed through the windows of the
h6use footsteps were heard descend
ing the stairway that led to the place.
The door was opened and closed
again.
The three detectives rushed from
their place of concealment and found
a startled woman, who held in her
arms a baby. It was Mrs. Torturiti.
She was quickly taken to the Hall of
Justice and at once put through a
course of questioning.
Detectives Taylor and Harrison
went to the scene of the killing and
waited with Detective Ed Gibaon.
About noon or a little after Sam Pos
sofrumi pushed his way througk a
little crowd congregated in front' of
the house and tried to enter it.
"I look for Pietro," he announced.
POSSOFUMI ARRESTED.
He was instantly seized by Taylor
and Harrison. On being searched
there was found on his person a mur
derous dirk.
"I carry it because I am afraid," he
explained. "There is much killing in
this part of town."
Possofumi was also locked up in
the City Prison.
By a slip of the tongue the prison
er let out a statement that contra
dicts entirely the woman's story told
to Captain Burnett.
"I saw Pietro and his wife Thurs
day night," he declared.
"I saw my husband at 11 o'clock
Wednesday night â never since then,"
, asserted Mrs. Torturiti.
With her pretty, smiling baby in
her arms the woman 'sat and an
swered, with evident reluctance, the
questions put to her by the detectives.
Her rather pretty face wore some
thing between a scowl and the look of
a hunted animal.
This is the story she told in broken
English:
"My husband is Pietro Torturiti, a
can maker employed by the American
Can Company.
"On Wednesday night I cooked the
evening meal after 6. My husband
took some food in to Vilardo and we
ate ours in the kitchen.
"About half past 7 I went out to
take a walk with my baby. I came
back about half past 9 and went to
I bed right away and fell asleep.
"About half past 11 my husband
came into the bedroom. I asked him
where Vilardo was and he told me to
mind my own business.
"I was always very much afraid oi
my husband^-and I did not ask him
anything else. He went out and 1
have not seen him since.
"But Thursday he sent word to me
to meet him at Washington Square
Park. I went there with the baby and
waited. But my husband did not
corn*."
When questioned as to whether hei
husband was Jealous of Vilardo, she
declared that she did not think so
She also Insisted that she knew of nc
' trouble between her husband and Vil
1 ardo.
The woman gtrve the following de
scription of her "husband: He is 26
years old ana a native of Sicily. He
is about-flve feet four inches in height
and weighs 140 poilnds. He talks
English well, always in a loud tone of
voice.
When she saw him on Wednesday
night he wore dark clothes and a soft
felt hat. He was formerly a section
b'^s on the Missouri Pacific road.
In a storeroom in the rear of the
house the detectives found a bundle of
rope corresponding to the cord that was
tied about the trunk. A revolver with
n holster that could be concealed be
neath the coat was found. It was load
ed. The holster arrangement is such as
is used by men handling weapons
habitually.
The service stripes on the uniform
coat worn by Torturiti when the tin
type was taken would Indicate that
he had seen service during the Spanish-
American war.

startled manner when she spied me and
seemed very much afraid. Of course,
I did not know that anything was
wrong, so 1 pimply passed the time of
day with her as she opened the door
to go in.
"Her husband always went t<> work
before that time, so I knew she was
not out buying anything for the morn
ing meal. She used the key to open
the door and I thought that was rather
strange, from the fact that it was not
likely she would lock up the house
when about to run an errand around
the corner.
"I cannot imagine what the woman
was doing in the place, but there is
no question in my mind that she was
dispatched there by her husband,
with whom she stayed during the
night. She came up Green street on
each occasion and went away in the
same direction.
'Her carrying a bundle on each oc
casion was probably a ruse to ward
off suspicion. She was very careful
to look around her each time before
entering the gate and went In and
left the place very rapidly, as though
she were afraid some one was watch
ing her."
UPSETB HER STORY.
This evidence completely upsets the
story told by the woman that she
never visited the house after leaving
it on Wednesday night, shortly after
7 o'clock. It also establishes beyond
a doubt the fact that the woman knew
all about the crime, for upon entering
the room of death it certainly was
necessary for her to gaze upon the
blood stains and other evidences of
the crime.
It is very likely that Mrs. Torturiti
did the cleaning up at the house and
that the bundles she carried contained
the whitewash and the brush with
which the place v.as renovated. The
landlord had not seen the husband of
the woman enter the house since
Wednesday, so it would appear that
the woman did the cleaning.
Torturiti always carried a large
amonrit of money on' his person and
he was wont to spend a deal of It in
the neighboring saloons. It was his
custom to drop in every morning be
fore going to work and again at night,
just before supper, he would take an
other drink. He passed much of" his
time in the saloons of the neighbor
hood after working hours and was
known as a liberal spender.
The neighbors knew Torturiti as a
religious man and many times he used
to discuss things divine. He always
seemed to speak with reverence re
j gardtng church matters and gave his
1 listeners the idea that he was- a pious
sort of individual. He was known as
a steady workman and appeared to
be of a higher class than his fellow
laborers. He never spok*Â» of his do
mestic affairs and his wife was seen
but seldom in the neighborhood.

EVEN THE DANTE
HOUSE IS FRAUD
Special DlÂ»pa.tch to The Call
LONDON. April 8. â American trav
elers in Europe can't be blamed
after this, if they refuse to take any
stock in houses with "literary associa
tions." For, one by one, the supposed
ly historic mansion* in which tourists
have taken most delight are being
branded as frauds. By this time most
persons know that the place in Lin
coln's Inn Fields that poses as the
original "Old Curiosity Shop" is noth
ing of the sort. It has been proved,
too, that Juliet never Inhabited the
mansion in Verona which is exhibited
to visitors as her "home," and that
Kenllworth Castle was not the scene
of Amy Robsart's death, in spite of Sir
Walter Scott. The old Cheshire
Cheese Tavern, in Fleet street, is de
nied the honor of having been Dr.
Johnson's favorite haunt. And now
comes an Italian savant with the as
sertion that Dante never lived In the
house in Florence which thousands of
travelers visit every year under the
Impression that It waa his.
It is true that the authenticity of the
dwelling near the Church of San Mar
tino was vouched for by a commission
appointed by the Florentine authorities
In 1865 and that their opinion was
confirmed five years later by another
official manifesto. Slgnor Giorgio
Piranesi, who has been investigating
the subject for several months, main
tains, however, that the two sets of
commissioners must have totally mis
understood the evidence before "them
and that the house they accepted as
genuine cannot have belonged tq either
Dante or to any member of his family.
He affirms that the poet's real house
was destroyed at the time of his ban
ishment. Sif^ior Piranesi says that
there Is some evidence in favor of be
lieving that the house which once
stood In the Via de Cinatori, on the
opposite side of San Martino from the
traditional hopae, was once Inhabited
by some of the Alighierl family, but
this dwelling has long since disap
peared.
FLAUBERT'S HOUSE.
Flaubert's house in Rouen, where
"Madame Bovary" was written, has
been having attention of late, not be
cause there is any doubuof its authen
ticity, but because something will have
to be done to save it from destruction.
As a matter of fact, the novelist's act
ual dwelling was pulled down two or
three years ago and a factory stands
on its site, but there remains a sort of
summer house on the bank of the Seine
in which the great writer and preceptor
of De Maupassant used to work. He
used to walk up and down on the path
by the river, cudgeling his brain fur
his "inevitable" adjectives, and his
great figure, almost invariably en
veloped in a huge ulster, never failed
to excite the curiosity of passers-by.
Mothers, it is said, used to frighten
their children by threatening that if
they were not good they should be sent
"to the house of M. Flau." as the au
thor was known to his neighbors. For
the purpose of saving Flaubert's sum
mer house a committee has been
formed in Rouen and a fund has been
opened to which his admirers are asked
â¦Â« contribute.
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 9, 1905.
That there's a lot of money to be
made out of literary relics, whether
genuine or not, is being proved right
along. The latest instance comes from
Paris, where an imaginative old clothes
dealer has Just succeeded in getting
more money out of certain pairs of
trousers that never belonged to Victor
Hugo than, according to all accounts,
the novelist ever was able to find in
those that did. This "ole clo" man in
question appeared not long ago at a
house in the Rue Levigne and present
ing a pair of faded though still pre
sentable "pants" assured the concierge
that they belonged to the author of
"Lea Miserables" and that he had just
bought them for $10. The concierge be
lieved the tale and passed it on to sev
eral people in the house, with the re
sult that the old clothes man's premises
were Invaded next day by a rapacious
crowd of curio hunters. To these he
sold single buttons, off the trousers at
pretty good prices, and finding the de
mand still brisk parted with a whole leg
for |20. The remainder of the supposed
"relic" the venerable miscreant kept
for another district, where he succeed
ed in getting even better prices, eventu
ally parting with the second leg for $30.
Realizing that there was a little gold
mine in the thing, the old man lost no
time In producing other remnants of
the poet's trousers, which he palmed off
at fancy prices in different neighbor
hoods. Finally, however, the police got
wind of the matter, and finding that
the supply of trouser remnants was out
of all proportions to the dead writer's
wardrobe arrested the enterprising
salesman, who by that time had cleared
about $76.
"AD" CAUSES TROUBLE.
All things considered, England has
taken rather kindly to American ad
vertising methods, but evidently the
Fatherla -Â«; will take a lot of convert
ing in this direction. The two quali
ties which the German newspaper
reader demands in an advertiser are
modesty and brevity, and when these
are not displayed he gets mad. To
advertise to the extent of a quarter of
a column is considered "bombastic"
in Germany, as a certain Anglo-Amer
ican business man knows to his cost.
Quite recently he took the above men
tioned amount of space in a Berlin
newspaper to /advertise a well known
patent medicine. A few days after the
ad appeased the editor of the nswpa
per wrote to him jstating that he had
been* summoned and fined for giving
it publicity, and that he expected the
patent medicine man to reimburse
him. It seemed that the advertise
ment was considered ."bombastic." No
other advertisement occupied more
than one or two inches of space and
one of the subscribers to the newspa
per informed the local police that the
quarter of a column was offensive and
irritating to readers generally. The
authorities did not in any way ques
tion the efficacy of the medicine, the
editor was fined merely for offending
Teuton susceptibilities.
Probably American advertisers will
be able to adapt themselves to Ger
man ideas, but they will have to walk
warily at first. To begin with, the
Teuton frowns upon street advertising
and billboards are almost prohibited.
And when it comes to advertising
drugs a delightful vagueness must be
maintained. A patent medicine ven
dor is 7iot permitted to say what dis
ease his wares are intended to cure.
An asthma medicine, for instance,
must not be represented as a remedy
for that complaint. The advertiser

BOS"ll)N, April B.â Detectives en
gaged in tracing the movements of
Charles F. Berry, the absconding Bos
ton lawyer, who disappeared several
weeks ago, leaving half a dozen trust
estates valued at $500,000 of which he
had charge badly involved, have
picked up the trail in Nevada and say
that he Is now concealed in some min
ing camp there, where he has inter
ests. He is believed to be in Tonopah
or Goldfield,
Since it was substantiated that the
receivers could not find within $300,000
of the funds entrusted to Berry, com
plaint was made to the District Attor
ney and Chief Watts was authorized
to engage Pinkertons to apprehend
Berry for the authorities. Berry was
known to have sunk money in various
wildcat mining concerns and the trail
was started in the direction of the
coast, San Francisco and Sacramento
being searched first without result.

STRIKERS MOB
WAGON DRIVERS
CHICAGO, April B.â Under heavy es
corts of police a number of wagonloads
of freight were sent to various railway
stations to-day by Montgomery. Ward
& Co., despite sympathizers with the
company's striking teamsters and gar
ment workers. The drivers were Jeered
and crowds congregated, but the police
in force kept wagons and spectators
moving- Many arrests were made.
There is a possibility that the entire
express drivers' union will be called
out, owing to the determined attitude
of the express companies to handle
Montgomery, Ward & Co. 'a business.
Union leaders are placing dependence
on Mayor-elect Dunne. They say he
will strive for arbitration rather than
crush the strike with the police.
Violence was precipitated In Madi
son street, this afternoon shortly after
a light wagon belonging to Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s express left the Ward
building. No policeman accompanied
the wagon and a crowd surged after
It. Two coal teamsters blocked the
street and amid shouts of derision the
driver was taken from his seat, rolled
under the wagon and severely kicked.
Stones, sticks and other missiles were
thrown. For a time the police were
unable to clear the streets, but finally
the crowd was dispersed. Many per
sons in the crowd suffered cuts about
the face and head.
Officials oX ths Wells-Fargo Company
were quickly at hand and with the aid
of a boy the wagon continued on its
way. Meanwhile a heavy truck of the
American Express Campany had
reached the small express wason and
the two vehicles, surrounded by r>o
llce. were escorted through the streets.
The crowd increased as the proces
sion moved along and when the wagon
reached Van Buren and Dearborn
streets it was estimated that 7000 por
sons were in the crowd.
In Van Buren another obstacle was
met with. The elevated railroad plat
forms were jammed with a howling
mob. Sticks and stones were thrown,
striking the police, driver and many
persons in the crowd. The wagons weru
driven hurriedly to the express com
pany barns near by.
It was declared by policemen that at
Kinsey and Dearborn streets acid-filled
eggshells were thrown into the crowd.
None of them did any damage. Police
man Meyer picked up one of the mis
siles and his hand was burned by acid.
Detectives searched buildings in the vi
cinity, but rould get no clew as to who
threw the eggs.

FEAR AMERICAN
FLOUR TRUST
English Bakers Coming to
the United States to Inves
tigate Alleged Conspiracy
cotfstnom suffeeees
Falling Off in Shipments of
the Staple to Yarmouth
Spurs Confectioners to Act
Special Dispatch to The Call
LONDON, April S.â Oreat Yarmouth,
the fishing center on the east coast of
England, la threatened with a flour
famine ln consequence,- it is said, of the
failure ot America to supply the quan
tity of flour it has been accustomed to
do In preceding years. The local flour
millers are reaping a rich harvest.
Their mills are working night and day
ln order to keep pace with the demand,
but the oonsumeri of bread are suffer
ing because the price has been In
creased. There is a feeling among the
bakers and confectioners of this town
and several other places on the east
coast that there Is some sort of a con
spiracy between the local millers and
the American flour trust by which the
usual consignments of flour are not de
livered at Great Yarmouth. In order to
get at the bottom of the whole matter
William Jenkins of Yarmouth and Ed
ward Thomas Abbott of Hull, repre
senting the Bakers' and Confectioners'
Union of Great Britain, will leave Eng
land on the 29th lnst. and proceed to
the United States with the view of in
vestigating the cause of the stoppage
of the usual supply of American flour.
They mean to visit the chief flour mill
ing oenters and will endeavor to inter
view the leaders of the trust. Although
these delegates are representing work
men, they have the support of what is
known in England as the Master Bak
ers' Association.
His arrival was the signal for ovations
from the crowds. The King was deep
ly moved and insisted upon personally
supervising the relief measures.
Working parties are gradually re
moving the debris and continue to re
cover mutilated bodies and fragments
of flesh and limbs.
A workman who was injured says the
collapse was so sudden and complete
that it was impossible to tell what hap
pene.]. The men at work on the reser
voir, however, anticipated trouble, as a
fortnight ago three arches collapsed
and cracks developed in four other?.
The people hold the engineers are re
sponsible for the- catastrophe, into
whk'h the Cabinet has ordered a strict
inquiry.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 9. 1905.
IMPUGNING
THE MOTIVE
OF GERMANY
French and British
Press Charges
, Perfidy.
Declares the Kaiser Has
Designs Upon Holland
and Denmark.
Wilhelm's Real Intentions Cloaked by
Display of 'Zeal for Moroccan
'â¢Open Door."
SoedaJ Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April B.â With leading
Russian journals advocating a new
triple alliance between Russia, Ger
many and Japan, and the French press
almost to a paper declaring that the
Franco-Russian alliance has lost its
raison d'etre. Is "reduced to a farce"
and is becoming "the Jest of the world,"
the political atmosphere is far from
clear.
One of the most significant incidents
is the severe tone adopted by leading
Italian journals toward the Kaiser's
"chronic theatrlcalism," the Tribuna
advising him to confine his energies of.
that ilk to writing plays.
Whatever view may prevail in Wash
ington as to the motive of the Kaiser's
insistence upon the open door in North
-west Africa, British and French experts
believe he has only a minor interest in
that feature of the case.
"The German Emperor," says Jaures
in the Humanite, "has vast designs in
Central Europe that he imagines he is
serving by a hypocritical display of
zeal for the commercial principle in
Morocco, to whose defense France was
long ago committed. He seeks to use
Tangier as a pawn in his game for Hcl
land and Denmark."
Two years have elapsed since an
anonymous contributor to the Morning
Post, probably Sir Charles Dilke, thiew
out the astonishing suggestion that
Germany was anxious to place Russia
under such obligations that when thÂ«
time came for the absorption of the
Netherlands by the German Emperor
there would be no opposition from St.
Petersburg. Events have shown the
soundness of the observation, and Lon
don and Paris are convinced that when
Emperor William gave Nicholas assur
ances which enabled the latter to wlth^
draw troops from the German frontier
he obtained Russia.'! permission not tc
resist, even morally, his scheme.
Careful analysts of the international
situation believe the Kaiser's pro
gramme of absorption â twice publicry
B vowed by Count yon Bulow â was
checked by the Anglo-French and
Franco-Italian rapprochements, but the*
opinion prevails that he will offer;
France a free hand in Morocco, despite
all his flambuoyance, on condition that
she will not veto his darling project.
There i 3 not the slightest chance of
the plot being carried out. though it
might have been had not the Anglo-
Japanese alliance revolutionized the
relative positions of the great powers
and called into observance a new one
intensely hostile to Germany.
French behavior under exasperating
conditions is exciting the admiration
of the Britons. - >
"It would be a serious mistake," says
a week's end journal, "to interpret this
singular moderation of all classes in
France as indicative of fear of the war
lord. The cau^e Is to be found in tht
understanding with England; but there
Is another factor â the change in the
point of view of intelligent mea under
the influence of republican principles.
The republic has taught Frenchmen to
govern themselves."
COURT COERCES
COUNTY "DADS"
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRIGHTON. Colo.. April B.â Because
the County Commissioners of Adams
County did not honor a requisition for
a filing cabinet issued by County Judge
Gutheil, they were fined SSO each and
ordered to Jail l>y the Judge yesterday.
John Benbow, Edward Fitzpatrick and
Frank Purse are the Commissioners.
There has been friction between the
Commissioners and the Judge. A few
weeks ago the court decided that it
needed a filing cabinet. The Commis
sioners were asked for it, but failed to
realize the importance of the request.
Yesterday morning the Judge issued
citations requiring them to show rea
son lor their action. The Sheriff found
the Commissioners in consultation con
cerning another matter- The hour for
appearance not having been specified,
they did not go immediately to the
courtroom.
After luncheon the Judge issued
attachments for contempt against
the Commissioners, and these were
served. - The court fined them
$60 each. County Attorney Pierce
g&ve notice of appeal. The court re
fused to recognize the motion, and an
application for a writ of auperaedeas
was f=us;trested. but on account of the
absence of the court stenographer no
record of the trial was kept and papers
could not be prepared. Finally the
Commissioners apologized, arid the
Judge remitted the fines during good
behavior. He got the file.

RUSSIANS PASS SINGAPORE
Rojestvensky's Ships Look
Foul After Long Voyage.
SINGAPORE. Straits Settlement.
April 8. â The Russian Baltic squad
ron passed here at 2.30 o'clock this
afternoon. The forty-seven ships,
steaming slowly at eight knots an
hour, four abreast, presented a strik
ing spectacle. The vessels, however,
bore evidence of the effects of their
sea voyage, and at the water line
showed seaweed a foot long.
The sauadron was led by a large
cruiser, followed by three converted
former Hamburg-American line ves
sels. Then came the cruisers, colliers,
battleships, etc. The colliers were
mostly in the center of the fleet. The
decks of the warships were coal laden,
while the colliers and the former
Hamburg-American liners were light
of draft.
The fleet passed seven miles out.
Hovering about the Russian fleet arÂ«
a number of Japanese warships, evi
dently doing scouting duty.
The Russian Consul visited and gave
dispatches to a torpedo-boat. The fleet
consisted of 6ix battleships, nine cruis
ers, eight torpedo-boat destroyers,
three volunteer fleet vessels, sixteen
colliers, one salvage ship, one hospital
chip and three Hamburg-American
liners.
The fleet did not stop to receive dis
patches or to consult with the Con
sul. Subsequently the Consul visited
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's ship,
talking to him from a launch. He did
not board the vessel, but was cheered
heartily on leaving the side of the
ship. The Consul grave to the fleet the
ews of the fall of Mukden.
The vessels are burning soft coal
and a tremendous smoke is visible for
miles. Gangways were not lowered
and nobody was permitted on board
The vessels. No news was vouchsafed.
The only launches allowed to ap
proach the fleet were those of the Rus
sian Consul and of the Associated
Press. Natives lined the sea front and
were greatly excited.
Artillerymen and submarine miners
were Icefot at their posts all day. man
â he grunF and mines. As the fleet
ot touch the harbor limits, no
salutes were fired.
The squadron disappeared about 5
o'clock in the afternoon, still smoking
on the eastern horizon.

and rifle fire. Our casualties were:
Killed â Captain Prince Massalaky

"On April 5 our outposts, after a

RojestvenskT's Strategy Throws Ad-
miral Toffo Off the Track.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 9, 2:30 a.
m. â There was great rejoicing last
night at the Admiralty and Yacht and
other naval clubs over Vice Admiral
Rojestvensky having successfully nav
igated tht gateway of the China Sea
without encountering the Japanese.
The danger of the fleet being beset by
the- warships of the deep in the narrow
waters which divide the breastworks
of islands of the Malay Archipelago
and the possible damage to the big
shipa before the encounter with Vice
Admiral Togo's fleet was so great that
some of the naval experts actually fa
vored a route around Australia.
The credit for the strategy by which
the feat was accomplished belongs
solely to Vice Admiral Rojestvensky,
who accurately judged that, as the Ma
lay Straits are the most practicable, as
well aÂ£ the most direct route, the Jap
anese would calculate that he would
not dare to force a passage there.
Besides this, Rojestvensky planned a
6trategem to deceive the Japanese, with
the secret of which only two men in
St. Petersburg were intrusted, by di
recting the Russian Admiralty to or
der the colliers which were to follow
him to rendezvous in Sunda Straits,
5'X) miles south of Singapore, feeling
sure that the Japanese Intelligence De
partment would be equal, as it prob
ably was, to the task of ascertaining
the destination of Rojestvensky and
thereby not only threw the Japanese
off the scent, but officially deceived his
own Admiralty, where the news of the
fleet having passed Singapore created
quite as much surprise as it did in the
Marine Department at Tokio. Several
colliers were actually dispatched for
the rendezvous and may have already
fallen into the hands of the Japanese,
but Rojestvensky deliberately sacrificed
them as pawns in a bigger game.
The ruse worked, apparently, and Ro
jestvensky did not meet a single Japa
nese shin in the Straits of Malacca,
while dispatches from Batavia tell of
Sunda, Balli. Lonbolc, Flores and other
straits to the southward being crowded
with' Japanese torpedo-boats guarding
the passages.
Although there is some talk of a pos
sibility of Vice Admiral Rojestvensky
now putting in at Saigon, Cochin China,
it is now believed that no further ad
vantage of French neutrality will be
taken unless he is forced to do bo be
cause of the condition of some of his
ships.
The Admiralty points out the great
importance and the advantage to be
gained by pushing on with all possible
speed and meeting Vice Admiral Togo's
heavy ships before he can effect a com
plete concentration of his scattered
cruisers, scouts and torpedo-boats. The
belief of the Admiralty is that Togo is
waiting near the island of Formosa,
1800 miles northward of Singapore.
At the rate the Russian squadron
steamed from Madagascar, which aver
aged eight knots an hour, the greatest
r.aval battle since Nelson's victory at
Trafalgar should occur in about ten
days. The Admiralty realizes that
Rojestvensky faces great odds, owing
to the immense superiority of the Jap
anese in cruisers and torpedo-boats,
and reliance in his success is based
upon the seven battleships with which
he can oppose Togo's four.
It is thought unlikely that the Vlad
ivostok squadron will attempt a junc
ture with the Baltic fleet, though it Is
quite possible it may make a diversion,
undeterred by the fate of the Rossla
at the time of the egress of the Port
Arthur fleet last August.
SHIPS EXCEEDINGLY FOUL.
Russian Vessels Seem Unfit for Fast
Maneuvering.
CHICAGO, April 8. â A special from
Singapore to the Daily News says:
Admiral Rojestvensky's fleet, which
passed this port to-day, was about
seven miles off land and afforded a
magnificent spectacle. It steamed
along four abreast, an armored cruis
er and three Hamburg-American
transports leading. Cruisers, battle
ships, colliers and a hospital ship fol
lowed. The fleet made no stop. Rus
sian Consul Roudanovsky spoke one
of the torpedo-boats and the flagship
of the vice admiral. The vice admiral
offered no information as to . the fleet
or its intentions.
Steaming at tjje rate of eight knots
an hour, it took fifty-five minutes for
-the whole fleet to pass a given point.
It was very evident that the ships'
hulls were exceedingly foul. Long
grass streamed from them and the
vessels seemed unfit for fast maneu
vering. The crews of the various ships
heartily cheered Consul Roudanov-
Hky.
The fleet was made up of six battle
ships, seven cruisers, seven torpedo
boats, three transports, sixteen col
liers, one salvage ship and one hos
pital ship.
CHINESE rTiEET TO SAIL.
HONGKONG, April 8. â In conse
quence of the appearance of a fleet in
the Straits of Malacca the China
squadron is preparing to put to sea.
The armored cruiser Sutlej left to-day
for Singapore and the first-class bat

LONDON, April 8. â Insurance rates

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 9, 1905.
UNEQUAL COMBAT
IS FAST NEARING
Japanese Warships Far Outnumber
Those the Czar Has Sent
on Forlorn Hope.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. April B.â That a
tremendous naval battle is at hand is
the belief of this Government, which
hopes that, which ever side wins, the
end of the war will become imminent.
Diplomats see no promise of peace
while Japan demands and Russia re
fuses to pay war indemnity.
The entire Japanese navy is with
Admiral Togo, viz: Five battleships,
eight armored cruisers, fifteen pro
tected cruisers, seven unprotected
cruisers four coast defense vessels,
seven gunboats, two torpedo gun ves
sels, nineteen torpedo-boat destroyers.
Total, sixty-seven.
The Russian fleet contains seven
battleships, two armored cruisers,
seven protected cruisers, five unpro
tected cruisers (converted from mer
chantmen), sixteen transports, twelve
torpedo-boat destroyers. Total, forty
nine.
Not including the transports, the
Russians will have but thirty-three
vessels of all descriptions with which
to battle with Togo's sixty-seven ships.
Rear Admiral Charles J. Train, com
mander in chief of the Asiatic fleet,
has been notified by the Navy Depart
ment that he is relied upon to preserve
the neutrality of the Philippines in the
naval operations expected between
these belligerents. While he has not
so reported to the Navy Department,
It is believed probable that he may
have sent some warships to patrol the
waters of the southern portion of the
archipelago.
It is when the battle shall have
been fought and decided that the Phil
ippine ports may become internation
ally important. It will be remembered
that when the Russian warships ran
out of Port Arthur last summer they
did not close with the Japanese, but
ran for Chinese ports. At Shanghai
and Chefu there was considerable
diplomatic turmoil until they were or

prised at the onward movement of !
Admiral Rojestvensky. He had al- '
ready delayed so long that it was sup- j
posed he was awaiting reinforcements.
Now that he has proceeded without !
them it seems to the officers here that i â¢
he must have been ordered to do so !
by the St. Petersburg Government. It
Ls conjectured that these orders were :
probably the outgrowth of the tense ,
diplomatic situation, the war party in !
Russia desiring to hurry the last at
tempt of Russia to turn defeat into l
victory.
It is estimated that Admiral Rojest- j
vensky's cruise from Madagascar to ,
Singapore was made at the rate of
about seven and a half knots an hour, j
Ten Jcnots is the usual cruising speed i
for fighting squadrons, but the bot- |
toms of the Russian ships probably |
are badly fouled because of the long |
stay in foreign waters.
If Admiral Rojestvensky is the man I
naval officers here have reason to be- |
lieve he is, his ship's crews are now I
in efficient condition. They have been j
engaged In all manner of fleet exer- j
cises and drills since they passed '
through the Suez canal.
In quarters which frequently reflect
accurate Japanese opinion it is said I
that Admiral Togo is further south (
than Is eenerallv sumiosed. Ar lnnar I

DELAY IN SERVING FINNAN HADDIE
LEADS TO ROW IN RESTAURANT.
Hungry Customer Consumes Crack
ers and Twits the Proprietor.
With Appetite Satiated, He Declines to Pay
for Fish and Is Arrested.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Primarily responsible for his alleged
disturbance of the peace. Joseph Bush
lared. was the inability or the< un-
iilingmess of Max Lowenthal. restau
rateur at 7 Ninth street, to serve food
within a reasonable time after it had
been ordered. When he told the garcon
to bring him finnan haddie broiled in
Dundee ptyle Mr. Bush expected that
the cooking cf the fish would consume
not more than five minutes, and to re
lieve the tedium of waiting he nibbled
crackers that were contained in a dish
upon the tahl*. Four times five min
utes had elapsed, however, when the
smoking dainty was placed before him.
His refusal to either partake of or to
pay for it was the logical outcome of
his hunger having been destroyed by
the dilatoriness of its arrival, and not,
as the prosecution averred, because he
had satiated his appetite by eating and
drinking everything consumable within
his reach as he waited. The allegation
that he deliberately struck Mr. Lowen
thal's jaw with a clenched fist he pro
nounced untrue. In the struggle result
ant of his desire to leave the restau
rant and the endeavor of the proprietor
and attaches thereof to detain him
there his hand might have accidentally
collided with a human countenance, but
to say that he maliciously administered
a blow would be speaking a falsehood.
Mr. Lowenthal stuck to his original
theory that Mr. Bush's declination to
mnFume the finnan haddie or to defray
Its cost was prompted by the fact that
he had eaten to repletion of the crack
ers and bread and drank copiously of
the liquid condiments with which the
tables are constantly provided. After
clearing off the tablÂ«Â» at which he sat
the defendant transferred his ravenous
attention to an adjoining one and rap
idly depleted it of all edibles and drink
ables. Among the commodities that
disappeared were various kinds of
ketchup and sauces.
Patrolman J. J. Barry told Judgre Mo
gan of \\\c arrest of Mr. Bush by him-
Whlie or, duty at the
nature exposition in Mechanics' Pa
vilion, the officer stated, his ears were
agsailed t>y the shrilling of many
whiF'ies. and when he and his comrades
responded to the signal for aid they
found the Lowenthal restaurant sur
rounded by a large crowd and Mr. Bush
in the clutch of several sturdy waiters,
while Mr. Lowenthal led the concrrt^d
whistling. Thf prisoner did not offer
any serious resistance when confronted
by the police.
"It wit!? to me." said the Judge,
"that this case might be amicably ad
justed without the law's aid. The price
of the food ordered by the defendant
is trifling and the complainant does not
impress me as being eager to push the
charge of assault."
Mr. Bush adopted the suggestion and
offered to "make good" right there and
then for the repudiated finnan haddie,
an offer which Mr. Lowenthal promptly
accepted.
After dismissal was ordered some
body told the court that while Mr.
Bush was helping himself to the crack
ers and rellghe* he indulged in saroastfc
persiflap* at Mr. Lowenthal's expense,
asking him among other queries if he

Mrs. Clara Schimpf. widow of a po
liceman who was killed while discharg
ing his duty, has been sent to the
Magdalen Asylum and will be detained
there six months. Then, If she does not
amend her general conduct, a jail term
will be prescribed for her.
Friends of the woman and her chil
dren suggested her incarceration, aa
she seems to l<e an incurable inebriate.
She squandered in dissipation the $2000
insurance on her husband's life, and
the vitdow'fl pension of $50 a month
awarded her by the Police Department
has also been spent in riotous living,
while she has neglected her two young
and pretty children. She is a member
of an old and respectable family in this
city and was a very pretty girl when
sh* married.
Patrolman Winzler was on duly last
j Friday evening at Fourth and Mission
j streets when Walter K. Brown accost
ed him with a request to be locked up.
"What do you want to break into jaii
for?" the policeman inquired.
"Because I'm a desperate man and
may kill myself or some one else if I'm
not placed under restraint," was the
earnestly delivered answer. â 
"You don't look, the part." was Winz
ler's comment as he surveyed the un- ;
warlike tout ensemble of Mr. Brown, :
"but I guess you know more about
yourself than I do. May I ask for an
explanation of your yearning to slay?"
"Certainly. I have a beloved sister,
and Just now the thought occurred to
me that ahe might have committed sui
cide. That's enough to make me blood
thirsty, ain't it?"
"Well, I should say it is," acquiesced
the diplomat in uniform.
"And jail is the best place for me, ;
ain't it?"
"Not only the best place, but the only
place. While we await the patrol
wagon's arrival you might as well kill
time by telling me how you intended
to kill some one. Let's see your
weapon?"
Holding forth a pair of gnarled and
soiled hands Mr. Brown said: "Them's
my weapon. I wasn't going to hit with
'cm â just to choke."
"And it was very considerate of you
to decide to do your killing In a way ,
that wouldn't leave a muss for some
body else to clean up. But here's the
wagon."
In the court of Judge Cabaniss all j
recollection of having met Patrolman i
Winzler was disclaimed by Mr. Brown, i
| "I have been hitting the booze' pretty j
hard for a week," he said, "and I never '
had a sister." Then he promised to
shun "booze" and the court liberated
him.

Arguments were submitted to Judge
Mogan by contending counsel in the
rase of Howard A. Tennyson, dentist,
charged with having betrayed Desta
Wilson under promise of marriage. The
defense depicted the girl as an experi
enced harpie seeking whom she might
blackmail, and deplored the lack of
protection afforded by law to thirty
eight-year-old men of the world who !
are beset by sixteen-year-old sirens. !
The prosecution declared that one of ,
the opposition witnesses, a woman, had ;
lies so inextricably woven in her teeth
that even the acknowledged dental art i
of the defendant could not remove
them. Then the Judge promised to '
have something to Bay next Saturday, j
David Klein, alleged to be a merchant I
at San Diego, was accused of having I
obtained goods by false pretense from v
Morris Mitau, whose millinery estab
lishment occupies 1076 Market street.
The defendant, it was claimed, pur
chased about $1000 worth of goods from
the complainant, to be delivered in San
Diego, the shipper to draw payment
through a bank in that town. When
the stuff was packed and ready for
forwarding the defendant suggested
that he be allowed to take some of It â¢
with him to dispose of while en rout*
to his sunny southern home, so the
packages were opened and $130 worth of
their contents intrusted to his custody,
the remainder being shipped as per
prior agreement. But the San Diego
bank declined to settle, disclaiming
cognizance of Mr. Klein, and the con
signment, minus the $180 worth taken
by him, was returned to Mr. Mitau. \
The arrest of Mr. Klein was effected
through Mr. Mitau seeing him on Mar
ket street last Friday afternoon. Judge
Mogan ordered that Mr. Klein be de
tained in custody until to-morrow, by
v.hich time the prosecution may have
decided under Just what section of the â¢
Penal Code it will undertake his con
viction.
John Sullivan has been given until
next Tuesday to make up his mind as
to whether it would be wiser for him to

that he stole tools from a chest in a

a?e p one y| ce Regal Lodge
CALCUTTA, April B.â Telegraphic
I communication with Dharmsala has
been restored. The latest accounts show
that the earthquake was even more
disastrous than at first believed.
Of a total population of nearly 6000
in the town of Kangra it is believed
that only 600 are left alive. Many of
these have fled. Of the police only a
deputy inspector and four sergeants are
alive. Many people are still Imprisoned
in the ruins.
Dharmsala, Kangra, Dhwana, Pal
anpur and all the neighboring villages
were completely wrecked. Scarcely a
building remains standing. Not much
damage was done at Haripur, Derago
pipur, Nadaum or Hamirpur, but Su
janpur, having a population of about
6000 souls, is reported to be in ruins.
The shocks continue. There is no i
news from the Kulu Valley, but* ac
cording to native rumors a great
amount of damage has been done.
An official dispatch from Dharmsala
says the place is a scene of complete
desolation. Owing to the scarcity of
labor great difficulty is experienced in j
excavating the ruins, but the Ghurkas
are doing excellent work.
SIMLA, India, April B.â The vice re
pal lodge here has been declared un
safe as a result of the earthquakes, and
Lady Curzon, wife of the Viceroy, and
her children and the vice regal staff
have moved into houses situated within
the lodge grounds. Lady Curzon's bed
room was considerably damaged.
The shocks have ceased and the resi
dents of Simla are reassured.
An investigation shows that the dam
age to the vice regal lodge is so exten
sive that the repairs will take several j
months. Lord and Lady Curzon, how- j
ever, probably will be able to occupy I
the southeast wing during the season. {
Lady Curzon's sitting-room, as well as j
her bedroom, is badly damaged.

LIFE NOT HARD
IN THE BASTILE
Special Dispatch to The Call
I PARIS, April B.â "The Bastile!"
â¢ Heretofore these have been words to be
pronounced with a shiver. They will be
; so no longer, however, if we believe M.
i Funk-Brentano, the French historian.
; For after years spent in pouring over
; the ancient archives, moldy parchments
; and tattered records of this famous
fortress and prison M. Funk-Brentano
has come to the conclusion that much
: sympathy has been wasted on those
i who are confined there. The Bastile
was not, he declares in effect, a place
of terrors, but more a pleasant retreat,
where overactive citizens might ru
minate in peace, and even in luxury, on
: their duties to the King! .
There are those, however, who accuse
the historian of attempting to "white
! wash" the Bastile at the Instance-of
the powers that be. Most of the prison
documents were scattered and torn by
the mob that stormed the fortress in
ITS 9. The remnants were gathered up
and tossed haphazard into a cellar. Ten
years ago M. Brentano was commis
sioned by the French Government tot
classify and catalogue these papers.
There proved to be more than 70,000 of
them, and the task of scrutinizing them
has had a serious effect upon M. Bren
tano's sightâ ln fact, he is nearly blind.
Besides having come to the conclusion
that the Bastile has been grossly ma
ligned, the historian claims to have elu
cidated many mysteries, including that
as to the identity of 'The Man in the
Iron Mask." whom he declares 10 have
been Count Mattioli. an Italian diplo
mat. We shall Bee what Andrew Lang
has to say about that!
By order of the French Government,
too, another of the historic houses in
France is to be saved from destruction
and turned into a literary shrine. This
is the mansion "Les Charmette." at
Chambery. where Madame de Warens.
Claude Anet and Jean Jacques Rous
seau had their curious "menage of
three," of which the great reformer
wrote so captivatlngly In his "Confes
sions." The French Government has
i voted $5000 for the purchase of the
house, which will be added to the "hls
; torical monuments" of the country and
probably will be open by the time
American travelers begin to arrive this
year.
TOLSTOY ROAMS WOODS.
' According to a correspondent in the
St. Petersburg Novosti, who has just
visited him at Yasnaia Polina. Count
! Leo Tolstoy has given up altogether
the reading of newspapers and Is now
content to learn from his friends what
Is going on In the world. Tolstoy's in
jured leg, which he hurt in a fall from
his horse somÂ« time ago. Is now almost
j well and he Is full of energy He
i spends a good deal of time roaming
about In the woods, but finds time for
| a. lot of literary work. too. and has fin
ished and Is revising three more books
; One of these has for its hero a politi
i cal criminal who, converted to true
Christianity In prison, goes to the scaf
fold with the gospel in hia hands.
As most reaedrs know, Heinrich
; Heine and his wife, Mathilda, did not
; exactly recall Darby and Joan. An
echo of their frequent squabbles comes
i in Maurice Bloch's new monograph on
I Alexandre Weill, who was an Intimate
of the family. Weill used to boast that
; neither the poet nor his wife stood on
ceremony with him, and one day he
received a conclusive proof of this. He
was dining with them and a pike was
set upon the table. "What is your
candid opinion of this pike?" Madame
Heine demanded. "Madwua, it jg
stale," was Weill's reply, and the words
were hardly out of his mouth w^hen
the lady threw the fish in his face.
Heine only laughed. "It is a proof,"
he assured Weill, "of Mathilda's af
fection for you. If I did not know you
so well I should be Jealous, for these
demonstrations are, as a rule, reserved
for me."
RUSSIAN BOORS IN JAPAN.
In connection with the Cervantes
commemoration ceremonies, which
will be held in Spain from May 7 to SÂ».
the Spanish Academy has decided to
distribute free among the people 6o,ooo
copies of a specially prepared popular
edition of "Don Quixote."
Some uncommonly interesting statis
tics regarding the importation of for
eign books into Japan have just been
given out by the French Minister to
the Mikado's court, M. Harmand. It
seems that in IJOI Germany supplied
the greatest number of books to Japan,
96.394; Great Britain being second
with 87,608. The next year, however,
the importations of English books al
most doubled, while the German sup
ply fell off a little. In 1903 the im
ports of English works nearly doubled
again, the number being 315,518 â
more than all the other countries put
together. A significant thing about
the figures is the rapid rise that took
place in the demand for Russian books
by the Japanese in 1903. In 1902
Japan only bought 123 books from
Russia, the next year the number rose
to 1139. which is interesting in view
of subsequent events.
Although France has about as many
important women writers as any other
country, it Is a rather surprising fact
that the national language contains no
feminine of the native word "auteur "
A Parisian journal has been getting
the opinions of eminent men of letters
as to how this deficiency should be
remedied and these opinions differ

RUSHING WORK
AT NAVY YARD
Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
VALLEJO, April B.â lt has been
given out at Mare Island Navy Yard
that the transport Lawton Is to take a
large draft of relief men to the Asiatic
station for the IT. S. S. Oregon. Part of
the complement of 607 men who are to
go out on the Lawton will come from
the crew of the United States training
ship Buffalo, which is at Mare Island
preparing to haul down her flag: on
May 1. The remainder will be de
tached from the United States receiv
ing ship Independence and from the
Terba Buena training* station. This
statement Is taken as an indication
that there Is no truth in the rumor that
the Oregon Is coming- here to be re
paired.
The navy transport Solace has been
ordered to sail from Mare Island on
May 10 for Cavite. She will carry 470
enlisted men as a relief crew for the
cruiser Cincinnati of the Asiatic squad
ron. It is likely that the greater part
of the crew will be made up from a
draft sent from the East.
The request of the local ordnance de
partment that an emergency magazine
be constructed on the transport Solace
to carry the ammunition required for
the Aeiatic station has been refused by
the Navy Department.
The work authorised by the Navy
Department on the U. S. S. Boston is
being rushed to completion, and it is
planned to have the cruiser leave for
Honolulu not later than next 'Wednes
day. At Honolulu the Boston will re-
Uevp the U. B. S. Petrel as the station
Hhip.
Orders have been received at the
navy yard to place the distiller ship
Iris tn commission on May M. What
her orders will be after that time is
not known herf.
Starve thÂ«* soul and the conscience- is

SNEEZE MAY
CAUSE DEATH
PORTLAND, Or., April 8. â As the
result of a sneeze John T. Coleman,
the murderer of Edna Hoffman, Is
near death to-day and the physicians
have little hope of his recovery. Cole
man contracted a severe cold while
being brought to Portland and last
night he sneezed violently, rupturing
the sewed-up blood vessel in his neck.

blood.

POST DESCRIBES
GREAT SCHEME
Author of Postal Currency
System Tells in Detail
of Benefits to Business
ONE BILLIOX A YEAR
Large Figures Are Eequired
to Estimate Loss While
Present Conditions Last
C. W. Post, author of the famous
postal currency system for the United
States, is at the St. Francis HoteL The
idea has been indorsed by practically
all the commercial organizations of the
country, by Postmaster General Payne,
by Third Assistant Postmaster General
Madden, by the National Association
of Postmasters, by farmers' associa
tions and by many others whose expert
study of postal and commercial ques
tions has entitled their opinions and
conclusions to respect.
A proposed law to carry the postal
currency idea into effect was reported
I favorably by the Congressional House
| Committee on Postofflces and Post
j Roads. The influence of the express
I companies is so strong, however, that
! it cannot become a law until the rail
! road and express Senators are put out
! of the Senate.
Mr. Post is tall and commanding in
I person and sagacity â facts that are evi
j dent to even the casual observer. His
i bears the lines of an exceptionally
; strong face. Business acumen and
, ! judgment have already been demon!
! stratÂ»d as characteristics of this man.
' He is the chairman of the Postum Cc"
] real Company, the business of which
' runs annually into millions of dollars
i in the United States alone. Three yeara
j ago Mr. Post retired from active busi
' ness. He eaid yesterday: "I am not
\ giving my money to establish libraries.
I There are various ways to help the peo
j pie and to promote prosperity, and I
: am working on some other lines."
"THE SENTRY BOX."
In pursuit of his generous plan, Mr.
Post has established at Washington,
D. C, a bureau known as "The Sentry
Box." Men who have been prominently
connected with the governmental de
partments at Washington and who are
familiar with the inner workings have
been employed to prepare and send
from "The Sentry Box" information
and editorial matter for the use of
newspapers and other periodicals
throughout the United States.
Mr. Post has devoted his own time
and talents also to Investigation and to
writing for the leading magazines on
current Questions of public concern.
The result is that hardly any man in
the United States In or out of official
life is better known than Mr. Post. In
an interview with a reporter for The
Call yesterday Mr. Post said:
"It has been estimated that the cx
i isting hindrances to the easy and ready
; transmission of money through the
i mails entail a loss to trade annually
of perhaps $1, 000,000,000. 3Fhe present
j money order is tied up with red tape,
â  is troublesome to get and hampered by
the distances at which the rural popu
! lation especially â a large part of the
i people of the United States â dwell from
j the money order offices. The attending
inconvenienced and the natural inertia
of thousands of persons who would like
to subscribe for a periodical or to pur
chase articles of small cost, pay bills,
etc., but who in default of ready facili
ties at hand never carry out their pur
poses, cause to a large extent the loss
to trade that I have mentioned. The
plan of the postal currency, or postal
check money, remedies the lack of
present facilities and puts money in
the hands of the public for small
amountsâ sl, 52 and 56â that can be
safely sent by mail.
'The basis of the proposition is to
have the Government print all $1, $2
and $5 bills with three blank spaces in
them. This money is, in every day use,
blank until the holder wants to send it
by mall: then he will write in the first
blank space the name of the payee, in
the second the address, and the third
Is for the signature of the receiver. The
bills are thus converted into checks,
and are payable to no other persons
other than those, in whose names they
are indorsed, and are as safe as any
check. The bills are redeemable by the
Government, and, when redeemed, are
a source of Governmental profit, the
amount of profit per annum being up
ward of $3,000,000 â quite a considera
tion when the profits to trade arÂ© also
in view.
"This money will be in the hands of
every one, and the redemption and re
newal of the bills will be simple. They
will be received and be handled by the
persons to whom they are sent exact
ly as checks are handled. They will
be canceled, find their way into the
clearing-houses in the daily settle-
ments, be forwarded to Washington
and be redeemed. While I originated
the idea seven or eight years ago,
something similar has occurred to oth
ers. Samuel L. Clemens, known as
'Mark Twain,' when he was in Austria,
described in writing a scheme he had
for postal checks, and he has sent the
manuscript to me. It illustrates from
another point of view the obstacles
that are interposed to the free trans

he writes as follows:
MARK TWAIN'S OPINION.
" 'There is at present no way to be
guile the man into ordering the book
for himself. Therein lies the prodig
ious damage, the incalculable damage.
If he could order it without stirring
out of his chair or without any trouble
or bother the usual 3000-copy book
would sell â well, a ton or two. If he
proposes to send postage stamps to the
publisher he finds that he is just out
of stamps. If he needs to send several
dollars his check will not be good with
a publisher who doesn't know him. If
he would inclose bank notes (but that
is too risky) â very well, there is no
help for it; he must go to the postof
tice and get a postal money order, with
all that means of bother and red tape
and waste of time. Some one asks,
"Isn't the postal order a convenience?"
Yes; and so is the stage coach.' "
Mr. Post says that the plan he advo
cates has no connection with the par
cels post bill, and that it is an entirely
distinct proposition. Opposition has
been offered by the express companies.
Not long ago Mr. Post presided at a
large meeting in the Cooper Union in
New York.
"It Is impossible," he said, address
ing the audience, "to get any reform
in postal matters at this session of
Congress because of the express com
pany lobby and Senator Platt and his
appointees, including Ellis H. Roberts,
LOS ANGELES
MEN MISSING
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 8. â According
to the Times, a rsquest will be made
Monday to Governor Yzabel of the
State of Sonora, Mexico, through the
Mexican Consul at Los Angeles, Gen
eral Andrade, that a relief party be
sent to Tiburon Island to search for
two missing Los Angeles men, Henry
E. Miller and Captain Gus Olinder.
The men sailed for the island on an
exploring expedition several weeks ago
and have not been heard from since.
MYSTIC SHRIXERS

Shrlners, accompanied by C. R. Robin
son of the Southern Pacific, arrived in
Santa Cruz to-day to make arrange
ments for a pilgrimage of Shriners to
this city on May 6.
United States Treasurer."
When Mr. Post said that he would
prefer charges against Platt and ask
for his expulsion from the United
States Senate on the ground that,
while he was elected to represent the
people, it was discovered that he was
really a representative of the express
companies and was using his Sena
torial power for the interest of the
companies, this audience of New York
ers, by their shouts of approval, made
it clear there is a strong sentiment
among the people for a good house
cleaning in the Senate.

GETS A BOGUS
CHECK CASHED
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
SAN JOSE, April B.â Louis King,
manager of a piano company, was vic
timized by means of a bogus check a
couple of days ago. W. L. Martin, a
piano tuner, presented a check to King
which Bore what purported to be the
signature of J. J. Jeffries, proprietor
of the Jeffries House in Salinas, and
asked him to indorse it so that he could
get it cashed. King indorsed the check
and Martin had it cashed at the Secu
rity Savings Bank. It turned out to be
a forgery. A warrant has been issued
charging Martin, who is said to be an
ex-convict, with forgery.
WIRELESS TELEGRAPH
STATION IS IMPROVED
Navy Department Officials Erect An-
other Mast to Better the Ser
vice at Mare Island.
VALLEJO, April 8. â A big improve
ment in the Navy Department wireless
telegraph station on Mare Island was
completed to-day. Another mast has
been erected near the original staff and
the two have been connected by an
aerial cable, by means of which it is
believed the sending distance of the
station will be doubled. The Mare
Island station has been a great suc
cess.
Love may be misunderstood, but it
never misunderstands.

ACCIDENTALLY
ELECTROCUTED
Sseci&l Cable to The Call.
VALLEJO, April B.â There was a
break in the electric lights here last
night and darkness ensued for a few
minutes. No particular attention was
paid to the matter until Coroner J. J.
McDonald received a call to the Glen
Cove power transformer station of the
Bay Counties Power Company. On ar
riving there he found that James
Steegs. employed as a carpenter, had
been electrocuted.
It is said that Steegs, whose hone
was tn Napa. was temporarily left In
charge of the station, and that thers
being trouble with the current he tried
to regulate it. Not being familiar with
the working of the board, it is sup
posed that he touched a live wire and
received the full force of the current.

FREIGHT TRAIN
IS DERAILED
STOCKTON. April 8. â An auto
matic derailing switch prevented the
wreck of a Southern Pacific freight
train about sunrise this morning at
the San Joaquln bridg-e, fourteen miles
pouth of Stockton. Aa it was, four
cars and a locomotive left the track,
which is badly torn up for 100 yards.
The cab of the locomotive was burned
by oil, which took fire, and the operat
ing: machinery of the big compound
engine was badly damaged. A small
trestle upon which the engine stopped
was also badly damaged by yie fire,
which was extinguished by wrecking
train hands from Tracy. Wrecking
trains were sent from Stockton and
Tracy and the track was cleared this
afternoon. In the meantime, South
Pacific trains were switched on to the
Santa Fe track at Tracy. Traffic was
interrupted for a few hours.
The freight train was southbound
and running at a pretty good rate.
There were between thirty and forty
cars. As the train approached the
signal station the bridge tender start
ed to open the draw to allow a steam
er to go down the river. Engineer
White says the semaphore did not go
up in time to give him an opportun
ity to stop his train, which was au
tomatically derailed. Only for this
the train would have continued on
and gone through the open draw into
the river.
Engineer White and Fireman Cy
I ..am* Jumped as soon as the train left
the rails.
PREDICTS A JAPANESE
INVASION OF AMERICA
Rev. P. J. Stockman Says Our Mer
chant* Will Have to Reckon With
tin- Little Brown Men.
TACOMA, April 8. â "A Japanese in
vasion of America during the next few
yearg ig one of the most serious prob
lems that will confront the people of
this country, and those especially of
the Western coast cities," says Rev.
P. J. Stockman, vicar general of the
Lob Angrelea diocese of the Catholic
church, who has Just returned from a
trip to Japan, where he spent con
siderable time studying the customs of
that country.
"Japan is overcrowded," says Father
Stockman, "and It will not be many
years before her subjects are com
ing to this country in much greater
numbers than at the present time.
The resources of Japan, grreat as they
are, are not great enough to support
such an Immense population and the
more progressive of her citizens will
seek new fields. They will come here
and go into business and will become
a factor with which American mer
chants must reckon."
Father Stockman says that within
the next fifteen or twenty years one
store in five in the coast cities will be
conducted by Japanese, and he looks
for them to engage in all classes of
mercantile business.

SEEKS DEATH
IN THE SEA
DENVER, April & â Dispatches re
ceived here from Key West to-day
brought the news that George Wilder,
who disappeared from his home in
this city about two weeks ago, had
committed suicide by jumping into the
sea from the steamer Concha, on
which he sailed from Galveston on
Wednesday last.
Wilder was 84 years of age, but was
apparently healthy and vigorous. He
was a pioneer in this city, was for
merly in the wholesale grocery busi
ness here and owned considerable
property. He was a widower and
lived with his three stepdaughters
here. In a letter to his business agent,
William Scott Lee, dated Galveaton.
April 4, Wilder announced his pur
pose to drown himself.
"I am worn out and tired out," he
wrote, "and I thought I would put
this old frame where there would be
no inquest, save by the sharks."
Before going away Wilder recorded
deeds transferring valuable real estate
in this city to his stepdaughters. At
Galveston oij April 4 he wrote letters
to these women, as well as T>ee, an
nouncing his intention to sail on the
Concha and drown himself at sea. He
mailed these letters on Wednesday,
shortly before boarding the steamship
Concha. They were received here yes
terday. Immediately telegrams were
sent to points along the gulf coast
directing agents to use every means to
signal the steamship. Efforts were
also made to send messages to the
steamship by wireless telegraphy. All
efforts, however, were unavailing and
Wilder was in fact already dead when
these precautions were taken.

LONDON POLICE
OUT FOR COIN
Special Eisvatch to The Call.
LONDON, April B.â When stories of
police bribery in America hvae been
published here pie newspapers have
derived much satisfaction from draw
ing comparisons between the incor
ruptible British "bobby" and the venal
American "cop." But faith in the supe
rior virtue of the home article has been
rudely shaken by the disclosures made
at the trial Just concluded of a suit for
slander brought by ex-Inspector Mc-
Carthy against one David Curtis, a
bookmaker. The evidence showed that
; it is no uncommon thing for gamblers
here to be blackmailed by the police,
but it was also made plain that "pro
tection" costs much less than it does
on the other side of the Atlantic. Tho
KnÃlish police official when he Is dis
honest is a much cheaper man than
his American guardian of the law,
which from the point of view of the
corruptor is a distinct advantage.
McCarthy had been twenty-one years
on the force, gaining promotion step
by step until he became head of the de
tective department of Division F. That
is one of the most envied positions on
the force because of the opportunities
it offers for "tips" for looking after
weddings and other swell functions,
and other gratuities that are not
classed as legitimate.
McCarthy had held his billet for less
than a year when he was summarily
dismissed from the service on a va
riety of charges, the principal one be
ing that he had taken bribes from
gamblers and bookmakers. It was found
that no convictions could be obtained
against gambling clubs in his bailiwick,
though complaints wero constantly
coming in. Also the street betting men
seemed unusually expert in escaping
detection. McCarthy's reports to head
quarters invariably discredited the
complaints received and denied that
there was any ground for organizing
a raid or instituting a prosecution.
Scotland Yard began to suspect that
the inspector was acting in collusion
with the offenders against the law.
Suspicion became certainty when, with
out McCarthy's knowledge, another of
ficer was employed and a raid resulted
in all the evidence necessary for con
viction.
The Inspector had been playtng the
game in the fashion too familiar in
America and feathering his 6wn nest.
But the steps he took to vindicate his
character showed that he was by no
means a clever rascal. He brought suit
for slander against Curtis, who had
lodged Information against him. The
jury acquitted the bookmaker. And
now the public Is asking how many
McCarthys still remain on the force.
Gambling-houses nourish In London
and bookmakers abound. The Inference
is plain.
On the witness stand McCarthy ac
knowledged that bribery was a com
mon thing In every police division, but
with a great show of virtuous indigna
tion he swore that he himself had never
taken a half-penny. According to Cur
tis' testimony McCarthy's price for
protection averaged a "quid"â ssâ a
week. Fancy an American Inspector of
police condescending to shut hia eyeÂ»
and close his ears for euch a paltry
sum as that! A plain roundsman would
scorn to be ewerved from the path of
official rectitude by such a petty bribe*
In the course of three months Curtis
shelled out to McCarthy $60. Then Mc-
Carthy threw out strong hints of an in
tention to raise the price. He inti
mated also that an occasional cham
pagne supper would assist in soothing
his conscience. But the worst of it was
he failed to "make good." Some of Cur
tis' confederates were arrested. Then
Ourtis told a couple of McCarthy's ser
geants what the "old man" had got out
of him. Apparently McCarthy had
failed to "whack up" with them, which
was another mistake. Anyhow they
carried the story to headquarters and
McCarthy's downfall followed.
The other McCarthys are down on
him for not taking his medicine like a
man, instead of causing a public scan
dal, which makes it an exceedingly
risky business for them to take "quids"
from bookmakers and gamblers.

NOVEL SCHEME TO GET
WITNESS OUT OF STATE
Felon Is Accused of Crime Commit
ted While He Was in Utah
Penitentiary.
DES MOINES. April 8. â When Gov
ernor Cummins returns from Wash
ington Monday he will be asked to
grant a requisition from the Governor
of Oklahoma for the return of Frank
Sherdiffe on a charge of murder com
mitted in 1801.
The interesting feature of the case
is that the officials here have proof
that Shenliffe was in the Utah peni
tentiary a nmnth before the time the
murder is alleged to have been com
mitted. The officials believe it ia
merely a move to get Sherdiffe out of
the State, as he is an important wit
ness against Thomas Denison, who is
soon to be tried for alleged complicity

INDOOR TENNIS
IS POSTPONED
The indoor tennis matches sched
uled to be played yesterday afternoon
at Mechanics' Pavilion were post
poned. One of the contestants was
unable to absent himself from busi
ness, while another is employed at
night. The only alternative was to
play the match to-day. It will be diE
posed of on the Golden Gate Park
rourts. The postponement of the
singles match was caused by the ab
sence of Harry Rolfe. His presence
was required at Berkeley, yesterday
being the last day allowed for the
completion of the intercollegiate try
outs. Rolfe and Gardner will meet in
the Pavilion on Monday night. The
finals of both tournaments will be
played Wednesday night and the ex
hibition doubles Thursday night.
The California Club courts were in
great demand yesterday. Few of the
cracks were out and the lower class
men had an inning. The most Inter
esting match was a doubles between
Melville Long and Lloyd Baldwin and
Sidney Salisbury and Arthur Chese
brough. The latter have been quite
successful since they Joined forces and
were consequently rather surprised
when Long and BaMwin lowered their
colors. Young Long was the star of
the four and received good support
from his partner. All three sets were
close, the score of each being 6-4.
Another surprise was the defeat of
W. G. Knowlton at the hands of Wil
liam Murphy. Knowlton has been the
terror of lower classmen, but met his
match in Murphy. The latter lost the
first set, but pulled out the next two
cleverly.
The scores follow: M. Long and
Lloyd Baldwin beat Sidney Salisbury
and Arthur Chesebrough, 6-4. 4-6. 6-4;
Dr. Lovegrove tied Moulten Warner.
6-4, 4-6; Warner tied Dr. Younger,
6-4, 3-6; Dr. Philip beat Dr. Woller
man, 6-4; W. Murphy beat W. G.
Knowlton, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3; Harold Ga
briel beat Albert Kenyon, 6-4, 6-0, 7-6:
Herbert Long beat Kenyon, 6-2, 6-3;
Hans Ltsser beat Gustavus Lisser, 6-0,
6-2; William Johnson beat Mr. Wal
lace, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
CITY GOLFEKS ARK XKAK

BERKELEY TAKES
DECIDING GAME
Special Dispatch to The Cuii.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April
B.â The banner of the blue and gold
now waves supreme over the colors of
the cardinal in. baseball this year, for
on the Stanford diamond this afternoon
the University of California nine de
feated Stanford by a score of
4 to 1, winning not only the game, but
the series aslwell. California did not
st?*m to mind the loss of Bliss and
Heitmuller, for they played even a
faster article of ball than they did a
week ago with these veterans on the
team. The visitors outhit Stanford
throughout, while the slow, teasing
curves of Freshman Newman were con
tinual puzzlers to the cardinal bats
men. The teams fielded at an even
pace, each making two errors.
It is to Strub, however, that the most
credit for winning the game must be
given. The ne*iy elected Berkeley
captain ofiiciated behind the bat, and
kept Newman steady at all stages of
the nine innings. "Whenever the fresh
man showed a tendency to go into the
air the calm voice of Strub brought
him back into form. It was his head
work which kept the cardinal from
scoring in the first inning. With only
one man down, Stanford had a man on
first and another on third. Coach Cow
den gave the signal for the batsman to
bunt, and Strub, guessing the play, j
signaled for a wide one. He caught
the runner as he came in from third
end then threw to second in time to
complete the double. The bleachers
were uproarious In their applause for
the clever work of the California cap
tain. The score:
Stanfordâ University of Cal.

largest crowd that ever thronged the
streets of Fort Worth welcomed Presi- '
dent Roosevelt to-day when he ar- 1
rived from San Antonio. The Presiden
tial special arrived at 8:45 and left at*
11:08 o'clock. Forty-one minutes of:
the President's visit was occupied by
the parade in which he rode. The re
mainder of the time was taken ud in ;
shaking hands with enthusiastic ad- i
mirers.
The President's visit included the !
ceremony of planting a tree in the lawn
facing the Carnegie Library, the first,
tree that the President has planted
Blnce leaving Washington.
The Presidential parade was distin
guished by the presence of nine veter- i
ane who fought for Texas freedom in
the war with Mexico. The ovation,
which greeted the President exceeded
U? enth uslasm any in the history of
Fort Worth. Never were business
houses and public buildings more
decorated and never before did a
cheering crowd two miles Jon* stand
in line to honor a guest of the city.
In Fort Worth to-day no sooner had
tne President finished and started for
nis train than there was a slmul- !
taneous movement in his direction. <
The crowd pushed past soldiers and
police in an effort to catch a last
glimpse of him and finally completely j
surrounded the train.
After the parade the President was I
introduced to an Immense open-air au
dience and spoke to them. He ad
dressed himself especially to the
Orand Army and Confederate Veterans
and National Guardsmen, urged the
duties of good citizenship and con
tinued:
"Here at Fort Worth I want to say
a word of special greeting to the rep- i
resentatives of the great industry in
which I have always felt a peculiar
interest â the stockmen. I lived a
number of years in a cow country my
self and always look back not only !
with keen pleasure to that time, but
with the realization of what was
taught by the life out there."
FREDERICK, O. T., April B.â Pres- j
ident Roosevelt arrived on Oklahoma !
soil about 5:30 this evening and reached
Frederick fifteen minutes later. The
President spoke in part as follows:
"The next time I come to Oklahoma i
I trust I will come to a State, and it
won't be my fault if this is not so. .
Give the red man the same chance 'â¢
as the white. This country is founded
on the doctrine of giving each man a
fair show to see what there is in him. i
I have traveled four days in Texas
and now I am in what will soon be
a great State of the Union. There is
nowhere I fell more at home than In
a town like this.
"I have had a middling busy three
and a half yean*. I have liked my Job.
I enjoyed it and was thankful to the
people for telling me to go on with it.
Now I want four days' play. I hear ;
you have plenty of jackrabbits and j
coyotes here. I like my fellow-citizens, j
but don't like them on a coyote hunt, j
G've me a fair show to have as much i
fun aa even a President is entitled to. j
Good-by and good luck."

..TO..
Ruptured People
Why wear a truss all your life and be in
constant danger of serious trouble which might
arise if your truss should slip, when your rup-
ture can be permanently cured, thus enabling
you to discard your trues forever?
This I know to be true, for I have made the
treatment of rupture my specialty for years,
and have cured patients ln all parts of tha
country, so they now hay* no us* for trusses
or supporters of any kind.
My method of treating Rupture la purely
original, and In none of the many cases I have '
treated have I had to resort to surgical opera- '
tione or other painful or inconvenient methods
of treatment ln order to effect a cure.
I do not require patients to leave home or
drop their regular work while I am treating
them, and I rurnlsh each paxlent with one of
my patent pneumatic trusses (pad Inflated with
air. making It the best and easiest truss to
wear>, and this truss Is to be worn during the
few weeks my treatment requires, after which
It may be discarded forever, and thÂ« patient
will be permanently cured.
The cost of my treatment (Including . the
truss) Is very small, and as a complete cure
li- certain, the patient takes no risk ln dealing
with me.
I (harge nothing for preliminary examina-
tion and advice to patients, and if you will
write me at once arid tell me all about your
caee. I will make you a proposition so liberal
that you cannot afford to turn It down. If you
really want to be cured.

WEATHER HELPS
TO KILL FEVER
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
NEW YORK, April B.â One hundred
and ten deaths were recorded for
cerebro-spinal meningitis in New York
for the week ending to-day at noon.
This is a decrease of twenty deaths
from the mortality record of the prev
vious week. Health department officials
believe the epidemic has passed its
highest point and that the death rate
will decrease steadily from now until
warm weather kills the disease.
"This is particularly encouraging."
said Dr. W. H. Gilfoy. registrar of the
health department, "when it Is recalled
that last year's epidemic did not
weaken until the week ending May 18.
This year's epidemic had an earlier
start by some six weeks but Is ap
parently also to have an earlier end
ing."
There were fourteen deaths from
meningitis in this city to-day, nine in
Manhattan and five in Brooklyn.
WHEAT KING DIES POOR.
Once Daring Speculator Passes Away
in Chicago.
CHICAGO. April B.â Edward W.
Mitchell, at one time a leading figure
on the Chicago Board of Trade, or
ganizer of the corner in wheat in
1868 and who was once worth mil
lions, is dead at the County Hospital,
at 70 years of age, a pauper.
His fall came In 1870, only two
years after he had cornered the wheat
market and made a fortune. Since
then he has lived in the hope that one
day he would regain his former
wealth. But his failure had so shak
en him that he never regained his po
sition, but grew poorer and poorer,
until in recent years he depended en
tirely upon the charity of his friends.
Members of the Board of Trade made
up a subscription to help defray his
funeral expenses.

WRITES LETTER TO WIFE.
"To Annie Peterson â Dear Annie:
As this is the only way I have of send
ing you my last message, whioh will
not reach you until I have passed
away, dear Annie. i
"I feel as if I was going mad, and
concluded to end it all. I rather die
than to spend another day of torture
in here and seeing that you cannot
forgive me for what I have done to
you.
Dear Annie, it was not for the
hatred of you that 1 did what I did.
"No, it was because I loved you
and could not bear to have you leave
me. But I hope, dear Annie, that you
will forgive me for all I did as I have
forgiven you; but remember, Annie,
that you will have to answer before
your God some day for this, and may
he have mercy on you.
"You have driven me to my grave,
but I am not afraid to die, for death is
sweet to the agony I have suffered
since that most unfortunate morning.
And, Annie, I hope that these words I
have written, and as you read them,
â¢will never cease ringing in your ears
until your last dying hour. And I hope
that you will never send another man
to his grave the way you did me.
"Now, dear Annie, if you had only
stopped to think and reason and listen
to me, in place of listening to every
body else, and stayed at home like an
other honest wife, things would have
been different. We had a good home
and would have been happy, but I hope
you will find out what your â as you
call them â friends will do for you if
you shoufd be in need. Then you will
find out and see the folly of it all be
fore you die.
"But after all, Annie, I love you still
to this my last dying hour, and I die
happy and contented, with a smile on
my face, thinking of you. Bidding you
a kind and last farewell, with love and
kieses, I am as ever, yours in death,
"JULIUS."
WORLD A WICKED ONE.
"J. A. Thompson â Dear Brothers, Sis
ters and Babies: This is to me a most
trying hour in sending you this, my
last message. This is getting unbear
able and I have concluded to put an
end to it all. 1 feel keenly the disgrace
I have brought upon myself and our
family, and all on account of the wom
an I love.
"But, dear ones, I hope you will for
give me, as I have forgiven. My life
has been an unhappy one ever since I
met that woman, which is now thirteen
years agoâ which proved to be the un
lucky number for me.
"But such is life in this wicked
world. Now, dear brothers and sisters,
I hope you will not take this too hard
to heart, for the parting is only tem
porary and we v.ill soon meet again,
and 1 hope that none of you will have
to die the way I did. But I am happy
and contented with my lot and go to
my death without flinching. I wished
so much that I could have seen you
and kissed you all good-by, but such
was not to be my pleasure.
"I have suffered much since I have
been in here, but, thank God, It will
soon be over with; and, dear ones, T
hope jou will take care of my body
and grant me this last requestâ l want
to be cremated. Then I feel as if I was
always with you. Now, dear ones, I
v ill bid you all a last farewell, thank
ing you one and all for what you have
done for me, hoping that you will bear
up bravely under the strain and forgive
me for all that I have done. Kiss the
babes for me and please never let them
know how I died. With love and kisses
to you all, from yours as ever, a loving
brother in death. JULIUS.
"Good-by, dear ones."

OF A FIREBUG
Night Watchman in Berke
ley Finds Blaze Thought
to Be Incendiary's Work
SAVES BUSINESS BLOCKS
Charred Straw in Room Over
Oil Tanks Gives Clew
to the Method Employed
BERKELEY, April B.â Flre that Is
believed to have been of Incendiary
origin was discovered early this morn
ing by Night Watchman George
Thompson In the building on Center
street and Shattuck avenue recently
vacated by the Troy laundry. Thomp
son observed flames coming from the
upper story of the deserted building,
and breaking into the place discovered
that straw in a vacant room had been
set afire.
The room where the blase originated
is directly above the tanks In which oil
is stored for the engines of the Troy
laundry. The floor was oil-soaked and
all the conditions were favorable to a
firebug's purposes, if such an individ
ual was responsible for the blaze.
The building selected for incendiary
operations is in the heart of the busi
ness district of Berkeley and is sur
rounded by other large frame struc
tures, all of which would have been
easily destroyed had the blaze in the
Center street building obtained any
headway.
CORRIGAN AND ASSOCIATES
DISAGREE ON A POLICY
Muster of Hawthorne Says No Agree-
mem Is Possible With New
Turf Body.
CHICAGO. April 8. â Rumors of a
possible rupture In the new American
Turf Association are afloat among
horsemen, who are unable to under
stand the action of Ed Corrigan and
others of the opposition body, who de
clare they know nothing of the pro
posed peace understanding between
the Western Jockey Club and the
American Turf Association. Corrigan
and , President Matt Winn stoutly de
nied to-day that there Is any present
intention among the American Turf As
sociation officials to move toward
peace with the Western Jockey Club.
Both leaders declared the new govern
ing body had things Just as it wished
them and there is no occasion for a
meeting "to arrange matters."
Some of those who are in a position
to know the state of affairs in the new
association are confident there is a di
vision of opinion between the directors
in the American Turf Association c-nd
that one faction is working without the
knowledge of the other to bring about
some sort of a settlement with the
Western Jockey Club. Some turfmen
believe they see a split In the ranks
with Corrigan, heading one of the fac
tions, still bent on making war on the
old governing body, while Sam Brown,
Tom McDowell and Julius Fleisch
rnann work toward some agreement
with the Condon forces.
ARGUES THAT THE TITLE
TO TRACT IS NOT VALID
H. J. Howard, a leadlnp land title
lawyer of Detroit, Mich., who has al
ready taken the Rancho El Pescadero
patent case, involving title to about ten
of the miles in the celebrated "Seven
teen Mile Drive" in Monterey County â
the total number of acres in that
ranoho being, 4426 â by appeal from the
United States Circuit Court for the
Northern District of California to the
Supreme Court of the United States,
has also recently secured a writ of er
ror from the last mentioned court, di
rected to the Supreme Court of Cali
fornia, in the above entitled case of the
City of Monterey vs. David Jacks, the
millionaire land owner of Monterey.
Mr. Hov.ard claims that Pueblo lands
of Monterey were especially held and
granted as a perpetual trust, and,
therefore, that the city as such could
not sell the same to Jacks, as its oltt
cials professed to do in 1559; that the
act of thf State Legislature of April 2,
1866, was invalid and without the juris
diction of that body, as was also the
final judgment of the Supreme Court
of California, rendered July 11, 1903;
that, by virtue of the treaty of Guada
lupe-Hidalgo, the act of Congress of
March 3, 1851, and certain decisions of
the Supreme Court of the United States
covering the precise point in question,
the title in fee remained in the United
States of America until the patent
therefor was issued, when it passed di
rect to the patentee: that, inasmuch as
the city of Monterey received the pat
ent for the "Pueblo Lands of the City
of Monterey" Â»â¢- November 19, 1891, the
title necessarily Vests in it alone, and
the so-called purchase of Jacks was of
no account and void.
Counsel of record in the Supreme
Court of California werp Messrs. Prin
gle & Pringle. Mastjck. Van Fleet &
Mastick, all of whom have been suc
ceeded by Mr. Howard, who was duly
appointed by the Board of Trustees of
Monterey.

MORE SALOONS
FOR REDWOOD
City Council Kaises Limit
to Twenty-Eight After
Much Adverse Criticism
PROTESTS UNAVAILING
Advocates of High License
Vainly Argue Against In

Special Dtapetch to ThÂ» CalL
REDWOOD CITY, April S.â After
much public discussion and consider
able adverse criticism the City Council
has raised the limit of the number of
local saloons from twenty-flve to twen
ty-eight The question has greatly agi
tated the community. Petitions have
been signed in protest, mass-meetings
have been held In opposition, but to no
purpose, as by a vote of three to two
the resolution has been adopted. Those
voting In favor were Councilmen Foley,
Luscher and Havey. Those against
were Councilmen Walker and Little
john.
Before the vote was taken Harry G.
Watroos and F. H. Thorpe addressed
the City Council, urging defeat for the
proposed increase in saloons. They ar
gued that the advocates of high license
had modified their activity with the
understanding that no more saloon li
censes were to be granted and that the
total was to be reduced until the limit
reached twenty. The petitioners plead
ed, however, in vain, and Redwood will
now have more saloons.

Scaly
scalps
Nine people out of every
ten have trouble with their
heads. Many of them
suffer from a species of
eczema, which forms a dry
scale upon the skin of
the scalp, popularly known
as dandruff.
If this condition be
neglected the hair follicle
loses all its vitality, the
hair becomes brittle and
falls out and baldness is
the inevitable result.
Coke Dandruff Cure has
proved to be the only
reliable cure for this
annoyfng condition. It
positively removes, with
one or two applications,
every trace of dandruff.
Faithfully used -t will cure
every diseased condition of
the scalp (except
constitutional blood
disorders), and will
produce a luxuriant, glossy
growth of hair after all
other remedies have failed.
This is a strong
statement and one which
we would not dare to make
if we were not in
possession of thousands of
grateful letters from peopls
in every walk of life, who
have proved, to their
intense gratification, the
wonderful powers of
Coke Dandruff Cure.
If you are annoyed with
any scalp trouble
whatsoever, get a bottle
to-day. Your druggist
will tell you the same story
of uninterrupted triumph.
Coke Dandruff Cure
contains absolutely nothing
of an injurious nature
and may be used on the
heads of the most delicate.

GUARD UPSETS
CONVICT'S PLAN
Timely Discovery Made at
San Quentin Prison Pre
vents Escape of a Felon
CUTS CELL DOOR BOLTS
Harry Hammell, Convicted in
San Mateo County, Makes
Effort to Eegain Liberty
Eiwotal Dlssatch to Th* Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April B.â Harry Ham
men, a third-termer, who is serving
twenty-five years for a felony commit
ted In San Mateo County, appeared be
fore the Board of Prison Commission
ers at San Quentin to-day, charged
with having attempted to escape. Ham
men has been confined In an incorrigi
ble cell In the old furniture factory for
many months.
A few days ago one of the guards
while passing Haznmell's cell noticed
that the bolt appeared to be cracked.
He examined the door closely, gave it
a pull and to hla amazement it opened.
Both holding bolts were cut in half. An
examination of the cell was made, but
no tools were discovered.
It Is thought that Hammell was wait-
Ing for a stormy night to slip from his
cell, kill the guard and obtain the
guard's keys. He would then release
his fellow prisoners in the Incorrigible
section, gain the prison yard with>
them, kill the guards on watch and
scale the high wall.
About a year ago Hammell cut a hole
through the boiler plate bottom of hli
cell. All of his credits were taken away
by the board.
The commission will meet at Folsom
next Saturday.
POLY BASEBALL PLAYERS
OUTCLASS LOWELL TEAM
High School Tossers Show Good Form
in Exciting Game on the Pre
sidio Grounds.
The Polytechnic High School team
triumphed over the baseball players
of the Lowell High School by the
score of 5 to 3 yesterday at the Pre
sidio athletic grounds. The game was
a good exhibition of high school base
ball, the fielding on both sides being
excellent.
The wearers of the red and black
earned all their tallies, while the rep
resentatives of the Sutter-street in
stitution were enabled to score the en
tire number of runs on wild pitches.
The fact that Lowell scored on errors
and Poly by hits showed the pitcher
of the winners to be the best.
The score stood 1 all up to the
sixth inning, when with a man on
third base for the Lowell side, Deck
elman, the Polytechnic pitcher, was
replaced in the box by Garibaldi, who
made a costly throw to first baee,
which scored two runs for his oppo
nents. The seventh spasm was un
eventful as far as the score was con
cerned. In the eighth the Poly bat
ters, with two out, opened flre on
Roncovleri and by a series of well
bunched hits brought in the required
number of tallies to even up the score.
Lowell went to bat with good inten
tions, but were retired in short order
by Garibaldi. The ninth was similar
to the preceding period inasmuch as
Poly chalked two more runs to her
account and Lowell failed to connect
with the "southpaw" Polytechnic
twlrler.
The teams were composed as fol
lows:
Lowell â Roncovieri, Cerf, Flinn, Is
ner, Sperry, Johnson, Hamilton, Pros
ser and Lyons.
Polytechnic â Deckelman. Garibal
di, C. Cuenin, McKenzie, Budd, Bliss,
Gabrino, A. Cuenin, Berl and Corco
ran.
DR. HEMPHILL IS ANXIOUS
TO FIND LATE WIFE'S WIUj
Wants to See Last Wishes of the De-
ceased Carried Out to the
Letter.
Out at 2020 Broadway, the home of
Dr. John Hemphlll, pastor of Calvary
Church, a fruitless search has been
carried on for the last few days for
the last will of Mrs. Lizzie J. Hemp
hill, the pastor"s late wife. It is known
that one was drawn for her by Judge
John Garber, but since her death no
one ha 3 been able to locate it.
This will, it is said, creates a trust
over the entire estate, the same to be
held by Dr. Hemphill for the benefit
of Mrs. J. W. Daniell. daughter of de
ceased, who now resides in London
with her husband, and upon her death
the' estate is to go to her two children
in fee. It is said also that Mrs. Dan
iell objects to the trust provision of
the will and, in all probability, will
institute a contest.
"Though I am not directly interest
ed I would give 510,000 to find the
last will of my departed wife," said
Dr. Hemphill yesterday. "At my re
quest Mrs. Hemphill did not make me
her beneficiary, so I am not directly
interested in her property, but I want
to see her wishes carried out. She
gave to me the right to use this home
so long as I may desire, and it was
her wish that I should use it, but what
do I want with so large a place, es
pecially without her companionship?
But the will, I fear, is gone forever.
"We have searched every nook and
corner of the house, trunks have been
broken op'en and the contents of
cheats laid bare, but there is no will.
However, a copy of her testament is
in existence and I hope that through
this instrument her wishes may be
carried out by order of the court."
Decision Cnuses Joy.
United States Commissioner Hea- j
cock's decision of Friday, which re
lieved Captain Schutt of the German
bark Professor Koch from the neces
sity of paying Uncle Sam at the rate
of $1000 a head for the trachoma-af
flicted sailors who deserted the vessel,
was received with great Joy along the
water front. To foreign captains the
decision meant much, and yesterday
they showed their appreciation of the
Judicial ruling by dressing their ships
In bunting. From the sea wall to Fre
mont street French, German and Brit
ish ships were dressed In their holiday
best. Neither the fall of the Bastile
nor King nor Kaiser's birthday ever
was celebrated with more generous dis
play of bunting. In the cabins of the
alien ships glasses clinked and liquids
strong and yaried gurgled down throats
that had dried with the friction of elo
quent toasts dedicated to the Yankee
Daniel who had knocked a club out of
the hands of the Immigration Bureau.
CUSTOM-HOUSE CLOSES.â The Custom
house closed yesterday In conformity with the

ciation, will be sent to each of these
contractors. The next meeting will be

IMPURE WINE
IS DESTROYED
1600 Gallons of Condemned
Brands Poured in Gutters
by the Health Inspectors
FIBM MAKES OBJECTION
Secures Legfil Advice and Re
fuses to Allow Stock to
Be Taken by Officials
Aotinc on the order of Health Officer
Kagan. Food Inspectors Lydon, Der
ham, Lindrum and Brodt yesterday
poured some 1600 gallons of adulterated
red wines into the gutters. The wine
was part of the lot . condemned by the
Health Board upon the analyses of
Chemist Gibbs. Samples thereof were
found to contain either salicylic acid,
benzole acid, coal tar dyes or arsenic.
The brands of the wines condemned
were marked with a condemned taÂ« on
Thursday last, and yesterday the in
spectors completed their work.
Goldberg, Bowen & Co,, who had 4012
gallons of four brands of wine con
demned, refused at the last moment to
permit it to be destroyed. Inspector
Lydon was on hand early in the morn
ing to carry out his orders, but was not
allowed to proceed in his work of de
struction. Hugo Keil, manager of the
firm, communicated by telephone with
Health Officer Ragan.
"We will not allow your Inspector to
destroy our wine," said Keil. "We have
taken competent legal advice and have
learned that you have no right to de
stroy our property upon an analysis of
your chemist. We have a certificate
from H. M. Curtis & Son, chemists,
that the wine condemned by you does
not contain any salicylic acid or coal
tar dyes. If you dump the wine out
you do so at your own risk."
"You are acting in bad faith," said
Ragan. "You and Mr. Goldberg in
formed me two days ago that you
were willing to have the wine destroyed
on condition that the Health Board
guarantee what is pure wine In your
stock. You said you wanted this done
in the interest of your customers. You
must not sell any wine that has been
condemned, and you can only sell from
your stock that is good."
Calling Inspector Lydon to the tele
phone Ragan directed him to quaran
tine the condemned wine, as well as a
lot of new wine which had been re
ceived but had not been analyzed by
the health authorities.
Another lot of forty gallons of con
demned wine belonging to H. V. Cross
also escaped destruction temporarily.
In all thirty places were visited by the
inspectors and the wine destroyed.
Dr. Ragan later made the following
statement:
The emptying â¢ of- the \ wine has been tem
prrsrfly delayed on account- of the stand taken'
-by these people and the matter will be< gub
; raltted at once to - the .City - and - County At- I
' torney and the District Attorney for their j
, advice, and no doubt criminal .proceedings , will â¢
- bÂ» instituted within a few days. ' - <
President. RooeeveH has " strongly declared
! himself on the "race suicide" proposition" and'
tho Board of , Health Is strong supporters *of i
â j hi* doctrine in this regard.. But we go. a step!
further and emphatically - Â«ay that ' there shall *,'
be-no "race; homicide l^ brtugnl 'aboirt^by -tne-'V

TORTURM
Whole Body Mass of Itching Sores
and Scales. Awful Suffering
for Fifteen Years.
CURED BYCUTICURA
"I take the liberty to drop you
a few lines to let you know of my
wonderful cure by Cuticura. My
head was one mass of scabs, and
â¢ my forehead was covered down
J^k almost to my eyebrows. I had to
J^^*Â»^igj wear my hat all the time. My legs,
Hi arms and body were covered with
|||L.||flL Bnig spots in size from a pin-head. to as
Wg *fg* Â®s<\l large as a silver dollar. A white,
|Â§? S& J crusty scab would form and itch,
â Sk^ Ls and words cannot express how I
Â«2^* / suffered for fifteen years. I tried
y&i'* many doctors and all kinds of
/>y <&\^eir^^iM^ treatments, but could get no help,
<^Ag3Uti^^^^^ and thought there was no hope
JmWÃmf'W&ZM^ for me - while in Michigan last
f^^^m//(mMm/^ summer a friend told me to get
W^^^WfWr Cuticura. I got a cake of , Cuti-
iÂ»rlg*l^ vy ill cura Soap and a box of Cuticura
'% r Ointment, and in th-ree days my
â¢ y head was as clear as it ever was.
I applied the Ointment night and
â¢morning, also taking a hot bath three times a week, and using,the
Ointment freely after the bath. After using one cake of Soap and
two boxes of Ointment I was completely cured, without a mark
on my head or body. I was so pleased I felt like taking my hat in
my hand and running down the street to tell every one I met
what Cuticura had done for me. I shall never use any other soap
but Cuticura. If any one is in doubt about this, they may write
to me."

BpÂ«cUi DlÂ»pa.t?h to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April B.â A decision
JUBt reached will open Panama's gates
to a horde of 20,000 Japanese laborers
and In consequence- a mighty protest is
expected from the Pacific Coast peo
ple, who regard the Panama Canal
zone as United States territory, which
may be used by the Japanese as a pre
text for admission to the States.
Attorney General Moody was asked
to render an opinion as to whether the
eight-hour law was an obstacle to the
desire of the War Department to con
tract for several thousand Japanese to
work ten hours a day on the Panama
canal. Secretary Taft has decided that
the alien contract labor law does not
apply to Panama and the United States
had not at the time of the passage
of the alien contract labor law gone
into the Panama venture. Although
that law extends to the Insular pos
sessions, it is held by Taft that the
canal xone is not a part of the United
States in the sense that the Philip
pines or Porto Rico are. Titular sov
ereignty over the canal zone was never
given to the United States, although
the operation of the treaty has the ef
fect of American sovereignty. '
6ATURDAY HALF HOLIDAY
LAW NOT YET IX EFFECT
City Attorney Modifies Opinion and

Operative May IS.
City Attorney Long yesterday mod
ified his opinion that the new
law designating Saturday after
noon as a half holiday for
public offices by crossing out from
his communication to the Board of
bupervisors the sentence -the amend
ment to the Political Code is now in
full force and effect." it was the
general impression that the half holi
day would begin yesterday afternoon.
The Department of Electricity inter
preted Long's opinion in that way and
closed its offices at 12 o'clock noon
Long does not make clear Just when
the law will become effective It is
understood, however, that the leiris
lative act becomes a law sixty days
after its passage, which will be "Satur
day, May 13. All the offices at the
City Hall were open as usual yester
day afternoon.

Special CorreapondAnc* of The Call.
HONOLULU, April I.â Whenever the
Territorial Legislature meets in Hono
lulu the members decide upon a trip
to the leper settlement at Molokai. The
usual biennial junket took place about
two weeks ago, when a steamer was
chartered for the trip, taking some 200
passengers, including friends and rel
atives of lepers, besides the Legisla
tive Committee. The result was a gen
eral debauch.
So disgraceful were the reports of
the occurrences that the Senate de
cided upon an investigation which, so
far, has developed that nobody was in
authority. Permits for the trip were
issued by the Board of Health and dis
tributed by the Legislative committee.
As soon as the visitors landed there
was nothing to prevent them from
mixing with the sick people, shaking
hands with them and kissing them.
One witness testified that he had kissed
his brother fully 100 times.
John McVeigh, superintendent of the
settlement at Molokai, testified that
"about 60 per cent of the people that
came ashore at Kaulapapa were under
the influence of liquor." Other wlt
nesseÃ testified that gin, whisky and
beer were in ready supply at the su
perintendent's house when the visitors
got there for luncheon. Evidence has
also been given that the captain and
officers of the steamer were under the
influence of liquor, though no steps
have yet been taken toward depriving
them of their licenses.
Chief Dinan Returns Thanks.
In the Police Bulletin issued yester
day Chief Dinan says: "I desire to
thank the commanding officers and
members of the Police Department
for the beautiful floral pieces and
their congratulations to me on my ap
pointment as Chief of Police and to
say that I appreciate the courtesy
and good will thereby expressed." The
Chief has? also issued a new order to
the effect that all members of the de
tective bureau and district special
duty men must in future report at the
City Prison immediately after report
ing for duty at 9 a. m. for the purpose
of identifying persons arrested.

Field Agent of Preachers'
Aid Bociety Makes Free
With Helen Gould's Name
IS QUICKLY REBUKED
Conference Adopts Report
Recommending That His
Services Be Dispensed With
MELROSE, Mass., April 8. â The
conditional pledge by Andrew Car
negie to give $1,000,000 to the fund
for superannuated preachers was an
nounced to the New England Metho
dist Conference here to-day by the
Rev. Dr. James Boyd Brady, field agent
of the Preachers' Aid Society, who was
appointed last year to raise a fund for
this purpose. Dr. Brady said that
Carnegie had promised to give the last
million dollars of a fund of $25,000,000
to be raised by the society.
There was an unexpected interrup
tion to Dr. Brady's report.
"I am engaged to Miss Helen
Gould," said the secretary, and then
paused.
There was a stir at the press table.
Several men arose quickly and one
started to leave, when he was stopped
by Dr. Brady's next words:
"To meet her and discuss the needs
of our work."
Before the sentence was com
pleted Dr. John Galbraith of Boston,
a member of the conference, addressed
the chair, saying that he hoped that
no reporter would mention the name
of the woman to whom Dr. Brady had
referred.
There were evidences of suppressed
excitement in the room. Dr. Brady
turned to Dr. Galbraith and said, with
some heat:
"I consider that a personal insult."
The last word was drowned in an
uproar, in which cries of "Stop, stop"
were heard from different parts of the
room. A moment later the modera
tor's efforts brought quiet and Dr.
Brady completed his report.
Immediately afterward the con
ference board of stewards presented a
report which, in effect, was the legis
lation of Dr. Brady out of office. The
report contained a recommendation
that no field agent be hired by the
conference next year. The report was
promptly accepted.

STOCK MARKET
CLOSES HEAVY
Doubts in Minds of the
Traders Eesponsible for a
Sudden Desire to Sell
BANKS SHOW SURPLUS
Impending N^val Battle
Between Russia and Japan
Causes Depression Abroad
NEW YORK, April 8. â Prices un
derwent a sharp reaction in the two
hours of trading to-day on the stock
market. There was no development
in the news to offer a clear motive for
the selling-, which was based more on
the doubts in the minds of traders over
the rate of advance during the latter
part of the week than on any change
in conditions affecting values. Amer
ican Smelting particularly showed the
effects of the recklessness of the re
cent speculation and after rising two
points relapsed violently. An intima
tion was broadly conveyed that there
was a hitch in the long 1 discussed
Southern iron merger and the stocks
in that group collapsed. There waa
selling for foreign account and the de
pression abroad was attributed to re
ports that a naval battle was imminent
in the Eastern seas.
The bank statement showed the sur
plus reserve unimpaired, but the re
duction of the loan item did not come
up to expectations and the cash re
serve showed an increase of $2,(562,000
in place of the expected small increase.
There was some rally from the low
points, but the closing tone waa
heavy. Total sales of bonds, par value,
$1,760,000. .
The tone of stocks was dragging and
hesitating to some degree during the
early part of the week, but developed
increasing animation and strength.
The hesitation was more manifest and
more persistent in the railroad Hat
than in the industrial section. The
spasmodic advances in a large number
of comparatively obscure industrial
stocks were of doubtful effect on senti
ment, but when United States Steel
preferred came into prominence with
an aggressive and sweeping advance
the sympathetic effect on the general
tone became more pronounced. The
unprecedented news of the plan to Is
sue Union Pacific stocks of $100,
000,000, thus doubling the issue,
caused a perceptible shock to the mar
ket.
The incidental declaration in the
Supreme Cou^ decision that the de
livery of the control of the Northern
Pacific to the Union Pacific interest
would directly contravene the object
of the Sherman law and the purposes
of the Government suit against the
Northern Securities Company received
only casual attention in the progress
of the excited speculation.
Misgivings over the money outlook
seem to have receded into the back

MISS LEMON SUCCEEDS.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
There are things that happen Just
once in & lifetime, first love, a CsJve
jzza, a Caruso Canio. When I
and saw that scintillant. flam
' erformance of Calves sprung
upon us like a r->lt from the blue one
night after a weary "Boheme," I sat
l-.ack to say, 'That is one thrill that
09&T be repeated." Neither has
it b*en repeated until yesterday, when
Caruso sang the Canio in "I'Pagliacci"
down at the Grand Opera-house.
Some one has been jesting with us
It was repeatedly announced by
r^ss ag-entry of the company that
the Caruso voice was "unmatchable,"
-at his acting was "respectable."
"Respectable" is precisely what
Caruso's acting is not. It is every
thing else but the thing signified by
that subtly insulting adjective. The
man can do anything. One forgot yes
terday afternoon, in the fire and name
of the acting, that, one was also hear
ing perhaps the voice of the century.
One remembered with amaze the de
bonnaire wjt and wickedness and
breeding of his duke in "Rigoletto."
As Canio the singer came "on as
though he had never done anything
in his life but beat a drum in herald
ry of a traveling circus. His by-play
â with the crowd was irresistible in its
rollicking, strutting, braggart bon
homie. His every gesture was that
of the traveling mountebank, his every
expression delicious in Its theatric.
pompous geniality.
D came Signor Caruso's mo

has ever fallen here upon a "La
commedia c finlta" like Caruso's, nor
ever will, it is very safe to say.
Vocally there was limitless beauty
in hie song at the close of the first
act. There was unlimited fun in his
6ong at the beginning of it. There
was again illimitable tragedy in the
vocal expression in the second act. If
you see and hear nothing else, hear
and see the Caruso Canio.
The rest of the cast was entirely

that when the audience got tired of
yelling for Caruso to bow, and to bow
again, it smashed all grand opera rec
ords by demanding a speech! I have
expert testimony to the fact that Ca
ruso's one and only speech consisted of
âit was in reply to a toast at the
Lambs' Clvb â "Gentlemen, I thank
you. One, two, three, four, five, six,
pf-ven, eight. No, yes, please, thank
you. 666 West Fifty-second street. New
York. Good-morning."
Preceding the "I'Pagllacci." of course,
came "Cavalleria," conducted without
particular distinction and in somewhat
blase fashion by Nahan Franko. It was
sung, too. so far as the chorus went,
without any particular inspiration, in a
light â too light â but sweet and pleasing
fashion so far as its Turridu by Mr.
Dlppel, comfortably by Mr. Begue as
Alflo. picturesquely by Miss Jacoby as
Lola and splendidly by Mme. de Macchi
Â«s Santuzza. Mme. de Macchi is not
Calve, but she gave a splendid per
formance, deeply convincing.
It was a performance that would have
delighted Mascagni in its brilliant sin
cerity and simplicity. For Mme. de
Mao< hi was the peasant girl to the
bone, strong yet helpless, awkward, in
articulate, blund^^g in her grief and
redly Dassioned. - She has a voice dra
maticâsomewhat piercing above stairs
âbright and powerful, that fits cu
riously well into the role. Her Santuzza
is distinctly one of the events of the
season.
Mr. Dlppel is always graceful, but
wa? not sufficiently strenuous in his
Turridu. In the heavier passives the
singer became only a graceful gesture,
the voice lost to view. Perhaos Mr.
Dippel was saving himself up for
Raoul. for his was the fate of the
substitute (for Mr. Bars) as Turridu.
As a whole, in fact, the performance
was not up to the mark. Mnscagni
Noii^d us on "Cavaflerias," and Mr.
Franko follows also the prophet Po
lacco, of sacred memory.
Last night's "Les Huguenots," as al
ways, was the vehicle for a large and
expensive cast. Nordica and Sembrich
were showered upon it, not to speak of
Hompr, Hauermeister and Mulford.
Dippel. Seotti. Muehlmann and Jour
net were the chief gentlemen of the
cast, and Vign.u conducted.
* in a season it is, I suppose
decenary to sing 'Les Huguenots. r
Tradition has made it a habit, and
one submits. But always there is
some resentment of its embarrassment

story from thf. particular kink in the
brain where it last struck. You patch
out your n.emory of it with the bits
your neighbor remembers, and then in
the end wisely conclude to take the

of the blindfold knight, the conse

between Khoul and Valentine and all
the rest Just at their own face value

BAPTISTS TAKE
OIL KING'S GIFT
Missionary- Union 1 Accepts
a Donation of $100,000
From John D. Rockefeller
BOSTON, April B.â The American
Baptist Missionary Union has received
from John D. Rockefeller a contribu
tion of $100,000, and has accepted and
acknowledged the donation. For sev
eral years Rockefeller has made an an
nual gift to the union.
Rev. Dr. Josiah Strong of New
Tork, president of the American
Institute of Social Science, has
joined in the protest of Congrega
tional ministers against the acceptance
of the Rockefeller gift to the American
Board. In a communication ip the
committee of the protesting clergymen
Dr. Strong says:
"We are told by those who approve
the acceptance of the gift that 'it is
not the business of a church, chari
table organization or missionary so
ciety to sit in judgment on the char
acter of the contributions to its work.'
This simply begs the real question at
issue. Can a church or society thus
wash its hands of all responsibility
touching all gifts which may come to
its treasury without violating funda
mental "principles of ethics?
"A man may become possessed of
money to which he has no moral right
in a great variety of ways, but what
ever the mothod the fundamental eth
ical principle remains the same, name
iy, that a man has no right to give
that which is not his, and no one has
a right to receive a gift which the
donor has no right to give.
"For more than twenty years we
hfive deplored the fact that working
men, as a class, refuse to attend
church. When asked why, the habit
ual reply is that the churches belong
to the 'capitalistic class, which is not
dealing justly by labor.' When men
who have kept back the laborers' hire
contribute largely to the religious ob
jects and their gifts are accepted work
ngmen believe that the church con
dones lniustice and are embittered
toward her.
"The conscience of the church touch
ing wealth profoundly needs quicken
ing. The new conditions of society de
mand higher ethical standards. This
:s a most favorable time to respond to
che nsw need."

SEES IN JAPAN
A FUTURE FOE
John Hays Hammond Pre
dicts Struggle Between
Nippon and United States
PHILADELPHIA, April 8. â In an
address at the annual meeting of the
Academy of Political and Social Sci
ence to-day, John Hays Hammond,
one of the speakers, said in the course
of an address:
"Japan's strategic position commer
cially, by reason of the suzerainty â
if not indeed the ownership â she will
establish over Korea and, possibly.
Manchuria, will render her our most
formidable competitor in the Far
Piast.
"America's interests in this respect
will undoubtedly run counter to those
of Japan. Japan is the only nation,
as I view it, which can seriously com
pete with us for commercial su
premacy in that part of the world.
The contest will undoubtedly be a bit
ter one, not only because of our con
flicting commercial interests, but ag
gravated by those racial antipathies
even now agitating our Pacific Coast
States. In that section there is al
ready a strong movement to extend
the principle of the Chinese exclusion
act so as to include Japan in its pro
visions. Retaliation on the part of
Japan will assuredly follow, and she
will have it in her power to obstruct
our trade with the Orient.
"The influence of the sea power in
the history now making is the rea!
'writing on the wall.' If Japan se
cures a war Indemnity from Russia, a
large portion of this will undoubtedly
be expended on increasing her fleet.
Her naval preparedness will require
that we also shall keep powerful
squadrons on the Pacific. True, the
completion of the Panama canal' will
make our entire navy more mobile.
Still we are now vulnerable in the Pa
cific, at Manila and Honolulu and
strong Pacific squadrons must be our
policy of insurance as to the outcome
of the Japanese victories.
"The war involves, then, that we
and Great Britain, also, must main
tain formidable naval forces at strong
Pacific bases and that the most Inti
mate relations must characterize the
diplomacy of the two great English
speaking nations."

Issue for a Great Work
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, April 8. â One more step in
the accomplishment of E. H. Harri
man's ideal of a transcontinental rail
road Is about to be realized. Millions
have already been expended in remov
ing mountains and in other ways elim
inating curves and grades. On the
authority of a high official of the Union
Pacific: it can be stated that the pro
ceeds of the $100,000,000 stock issue an
nounced a fe'.v days ago in New York
will be used to tunnel the Sierra.
At the time of the opening of the
Lucin cut-off, that masterpiece of en
gineering which carries the railroad
across the Great Salt Lake, Harriman
announced that the next gTeat work
to be undertaken would be the con
struction of a system of tunnels
through the Sierra Nevada Mountains
in Nevada. At present many miles of
snowsheds wind through the Sierras.
They are supposed to provide protec
tion from the snowstorms and snow
slides, but frequently they are destroy
ed by fire in the dead of winter, with
the result that the overland trains are
delayed for days at a time. The pro
posed tunnels would not only be a per
fect protection against the snow, but
would straighten the course of the
road, reduce grades and eliminate
many curvos.
While a portion of the $100,000,000
probably will be used In work now un

bring you a Chinese robÂ« for an even
ing coat â pale pink, blue and b
embroidered in gold. Their smartnÂ«Ml
seems now establishedâ but, ye gods
what a fright a fat woman is in onÂ«; It
you're fat, don't ask Johnny.
Has it occurred to you that the regu
lations of Lent are laying a chill hanU
upon the opera season?
At the matinee yesterday, likewise In
the evening, there were not a few cav
ernous gulfs of ether. But of mm
that may be due to the weariness of
the musical public to the afternoon's
bill and a lack of appreciation for the
sublime musical tragedy of the even
ing.
To-night promises a soul treat, a
time for calm reflection and a fit time
for repentance. So come, all ye un
holy:
And. by the way. speaking of repent
ance, would U not be a nicy thing, a
courteous thing and a polite thin.;
the ladies to remain u,uift aÂ»^ in their
seats for at least a second and a quar
terâor say a halfâ after the curtain
deecends?
Take old Dr. Amboynes advice an<l
â¢Put Yourself In His Place"â in tht
place of the artist .rho has given you
of his body, his soul, his whole animau
being.
Wait: give him a little mead of stratj
tude at the end of his efforts, and show
It by a reasonable pause before the
unanimous bolt for the doorâ the cafe>
will wait, if you willâ all of you.
It seems that greed lies at the bot
tom of this universal unseemly grab
for wraps and rush for the door â the
desire to get tables.
I doubt !f in Bullfrog such theater
manners exist.
But there's a whole week la wfcjcfe to
repent.40

SPRING EXHIBITION OF ART ATTRACTS
ATTENTION OF PICTURE-LOVERS.
"A WARM AFTERNOON IN MARIN." ONE OF THE PAINTINGS FROM THE
STUDIO OF C. CHAPEIA. JUDSON. THE PICTURE HAS BEEN MUCH AD
MIRED BY ART CONNOISSEURS.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
Have you â and you and you, good
friend, availed yourself of the oppor
tunity to view the California pictures
â bowing at the Art Institute? If not,
for shame!
If you have, go again! For there are
things thereaboutg that grow upon you
with acquaintance.
In truth are we having much from
the brushes of clever folk of late, for
out at the Mechanics' Pavilion iÂ« an
other show â hardly in the same class,
however, as that in the art palace on
the hill, but none the less interesting.
Out in that indoor forest are some
pretty bad things â that my little
nephew would tall "rotten" â but why
spoil a spring morning with a negative
fon over silk crepe.
Mrs. Dixwell Hewitt wore a brown
i velvet sown, with hat of brown chip
i trimmed in large pink roses.
Mrs. E. A. W. Waterhouse's gown of
pale apricot crepe was most fetching.
With it she wore a cream cloth opera
; coat and large white picture hat.
Mrs. John C Casserly was gowned
in a stunning three-quarter length
gray Redfern street suit, at the collar
I and cuffs of which were wide bands of
! modish white. A large white Napoloeon
1 hat completed a striking cos#nie.
Mrs. Carl ton A. Bierce, cream cloth
i street gown.
Mrs. Kate Peterson was gowned in
| black silk.
Mrs. <_,eorge i>tet3i*ig wore a gray

good to note?
And, by the way, when you deter
mine to visit the forest reared under
"a roof that our frail hands have
raised." hie you to the art gallery an-1
look up Piazzoni â the same Piazzoni of
whom T said some seemingly harsh
things laet week. Hunt him up, see
the things he haÃ to show out thereâ
bits of oldpr work, much of which he
painted in Paris, and note the change.
Also note the poetry, the subtlety of
his old work, which then were acces
sories to a splendid whole. Subtlety
did r.ot then swamp the tale the pic
tures fain would tellâ it was a simple
accessory that helped reveal the man.
That was sincerity, not pose. And that
was art.

BATTLESHIP MINNESOTA
SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED
Daughter of State Senator Schaller
Christens Big Ship as She
Glides Down Ways.
NEWPORT NEWS. Va., April B.â
The battleship Minnesota was success
fully launched at the plant of the New
port News Shipbuilding and Drydock
Company to-day. The vessel was
christened by Miss Rose Marie Schal
ler, daughter of State Senator Schal
ler. of Hastings, Minn.
The Nmcheon which followed the
launching of the battleship was a
brilliant affair. Among the toasts re
sponded to was "The President." by
Senator Carter of Montana, who paid
a high tribute to the present and all
former occupants of the White House.
RITSSIAN CAVALRY ACTIVE.
One Dctarlintrnt Burns Japanese
Depot uncl Stores.
HARBIN, April B.â Detachments of
Russian cavalry are actively recunnoit
ering the Japanese flanks and even
th<? rear. One detachment of them has
penetrated Hrdahilzie, where it was
brought to a stop by Japanese in
trenchrnents. Before retiring, however,
it is said to have succeeded in cut
ting the railroad and burning the depot
and stores.
The detachment brought back news
that a fortnight ago a mixed Japanese
division of 10.000 men with artillery left
the Japanese rear and disappeared into
Mongolia and was followed a few days
ago by another detachment of 5000
men. These troops are expected to
appear in the region of Bodun, which,
unfortunately, is connected with the
base by only poor roads. Kirin is in
the same plight and the loss of the
narrow gauge rolling stotk abandoned
at Mukden is especially felt.
Chinese report that the Japanese are
energetically transporting siege guns
toward Kirin.
SKNATOR A. O. PLAIT'S
CONDITION' IS CRITICAL
Physicians Do Not Conceal the Fact
That Patient's Chances Are
Slight.
WASHINGTON, CoW, April B.â
Senator A. O. Platt passed a comforta
ble afternoon and a generally quiet
day, his respiration being better at a
late hour this afternoon than for the
post two days, according to a statement
issued to-night by the attending physi
cians. Dr. Ford said to-night:
"We have no desire to conceal the
fact that the Senator's condition is
critical. There is still a small amount
of fluid in the pleural cavity of the
right side as a result of the second at
tack of pneumonia. His strength is
holding out well and there Is little
change in his condition."
CHRISTIAN CELEBRATES
EIGHTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY
Aged King of Denmark Receives Con-
gratulations From Heads of
Various Governments.
COPENHAGEN, April 8. â King
Christian to-day celebrated his eighty
seventh birthday in excellent health
and spirits. He received numerous
telegrams of felicitation from sover
eigns and other heads of states, and
held a reception for diplomatists and
others. Mr. Swanson, the retiring
American Minister, conveyed to the
King President Roosevelt's congratu
lations, and as dean, the good wishes
of the diplomatic corps.
According to figures recently com
piled, the total track mileage and sid
ing of British railways amounts .1 60,
729 miles.

PIAZZONI SHOWS HERE
Man" Good Things
Are Seen at Hop
kins Institute.
Glimpse of Gualala Bay," "Weep
ing Willow," "Old Hay, Moret,
France," and "On the River Loire."
I'm taking liberties with the titles of
these, as announced in the catalogues,
as the wretch of a printer has' a code
of spelling all his own.
Besides Piazzoni's pictures there are
some creditable things shown by Alex
ander Pope, a Boston man. All of these
are reflective of sport, as a hunter un
derstands that term, reflected through
gum boots, canvas coat, gun, dog,
marshes and a flight of ducks. Hunt
up "A Gunroom Panel"â it's a wonder,
as is "Flying Mallard."
H. R. Bloomer shows a fine thing,
"The Glen Inverness"; Ada Romer
shawhan, "Quim, Journalist," "Head
of Charles Nahl"; H. Elatchly, "Old
Cabin Home," a fetching bit; t A:m y
Bronson Dewing, "An Old Road"; A.
W. Best, "Mexican Pateo"; Alice M.
Best, "Old Gateway"; C. K. Hinkle.
"Scow Schooners": Maren Froelich,
"A Bit of Madrone"; Theodore Wores,
"Oleander and Cypress Granada" â a
fascinating thinff, and, to my mind,
more alluring than the much admired
"In Samoa," beside it.
Alice P. Chittenden offers some good
roses. Annie Frances Briggs, who
leaves soon for Europe, shows seven
interesting things, as do Louise M.
Carpenter, Nellie Burrell Scott, Charles
T. Turner, Sara Bender de Wolfe, Os
car Kunath, J. R. Dickinson and R.
Langtry Partington.
Notably good is Harry Stuart Fon
da's "China Shacks by Moonlight." It
holds an atmosphere wholly charm
ing.
The wonder comes to me if this tal
ented fellow is doing anything serious
now. If he isn't he should.
Up at Hopkins canvases that will be
worth your while to dwell withâ and
not with a nod and a wearied air â are,
besides those mentioned last week,
Isabel Hunters "Monterey Street";
â¢Ideal Head," by Joseph Greenbaum:
Caroline R. Callahan's 'L'Heure Paisl
ble": John M. Gamble's "The Evening
Star"; "Warm Afternoon," by C.
Chapel Judsonâ a picture breathing a
fine love of the spreading oak and its
cool hospitality.
The miniaturists are displaying some
good things. Lillie V. Ryan, easily
foremost in the art of ivory portrait
ure, shows two exquisite things, as
does Mary Soule Campbell, Miss Grace
.Wishaar a:nl a few others to be talked
of next week.
And herein is enough to keep you

WORLDS RECORD OF DRAKE CARTER
IS LOWERED AT OAKLAND BY ELIE
Great Three-Year-Old, Dr. Leggo, Stays
Gamely, Finishing a Close Second.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The long-standing three-mile record
14, made by Drake Carter over
the Sneepshead Bay track on Septem
ber 6, 18*4. was lowered 2 seconds by
Elle. a four-year-old son of St. Carlo,
yesterday in the stellar event on the
; &rd at Oakland. Dr. Lefrgo. the crack
three- year- old and a 4 to 5 favorite,
- <*d second, beaten leas than a
tenftth. The war horse, Veterano, was
third.
Perfect weather attracted a large
and fashionable crowd, which aufurs
v ell for long-distance racing, every
i. umber being at a mile or ovef. All
interest, of course, centered in the
thre^-mile contest, not only because of
the 51500 added money, but more out of
curiopiiy to see what the three-year
r. Leggo would do pitted against
a field of reasoned veterans.

PAY WHEN CURED
j Those who call 'ipon me in consul-
I tat ion sometimes express doubt as
â¢ H to my ability to effect a permanent
1 cure. Some say, "I've paid half a
: d^zen doctors for cures that I
never received." PAY AIE WHEN
I'VE CURED VOT" is the straight-
[ forward, definite and business like
: proposition I make to every afflict-
ed man.
"Weakness"
If other physicians have treated
>â <â â Â» for so-called "weakness" you
w-re help<*l only temporarily, if at
all. and the reason is very apparent
when the cause of loss of power in
Dan is understood. "Weakness"
' Isn't â  weakness at all. bat is
infrHy a symptom of chronic In-
-.ation In the vrcstate aland,
brought on by early dissipation or
some contracted disorder. My sys-
tem of local treatment removes
this inflammation, and is the only
treatment that haÂ« ever .or ever

Varicocsle
1 Many who are but slightly af-
: ficted with varicocele believe that
i the trouble is of little consequen.ee.
1 Tb.9 opposite la true. Varicocele is
a disease of a progressive nature.
As It advances nervous complica-
tions come, (wer diminishes and
itbÂ« general health is impaired. I
curÂ« varicocele in five <SÂ«.yÂ« with-
* out the use of knife, ' ligature or
[ caustic, without pain' and without
[ 6etenticn from buslneÂ«s._. j : â > . -
I Contracted Disorders
j Every case of contracted disease'
I I treat is thoroughly cured.' My pa-
Btients have no relapses. : When I
pronounce a case cured there is
not a narticle of Infection or in-
fianunation remaininsr, and there is
Bnot the slightest danger that the
disease will return In itF original
form or work its way Into the gen-
~, Â«ral system. No contracted dis-
order is bo trivial as to warrant
uncertain methods of treatment,
! ar , I especially solicit those cases
t that other doctors have been un-
able to cure.

ATHLETIC RECORDS FALL BEFORE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
Clark, receded from 11 to 5 favoritism
to 13 to fi, and then in a long drive led
the pacemaker, Golden Buck, out a
length. Macene, a 15 to 1 shot, disposed
of the poorly ridden first choice, Royal
Red, for show honors.
No chances were taken by the ring
on the two-mile affray, the book being
strong enough tq give Georges Hacken
6ehmidt, the Russian lion, a go at
Graeco-Roraan.
EXPEDIEVT FLNTSHES FIRST.
Expedient and Inspector Munro fin
ally closed equal favorites. The former
seemed bo overburdened with speed
that Bullman disobeyed instructlonb
and took the lead soon after the first
mile had been traveled. Inspector Man
ro came strongly and fast the last part
of the journey under Travers' urging,
but Expedient held him Bafely, scoring
by nearly a length. Ray ran a good
third.
Seldom has the black horse San Nich
olas performed so miserably as he did In
the third race, a mile selling nxture.
A 9 to 10 favorite, with Dug&n in the
saddle, he had speed for six furlongs,
and then dropping back finished last.
Andrew Mack, the played one of the
party, breezed home four lengths in ad
vance of Hulford, Telephone ran an in
different race.
Morita the Nana Stock Farm entry,
backed from 6 to 4, captured the closing
mile purse run. A. Muskoday beat the
favorite. Sea Air. seven wide-open
lengths for the place.

Dick Dwyer made six splendid
starts.
It would take a volume to give the
history of Irene O, entered at Oakland
some weeks ago, and also of her col
ored trainer, G. Wilson. Suffice it to
say that .Irene O was to have been han
dled by the same crowd that "rung"

ord was established by Moullen of I^ick
School In the pole vault, in which he
cleared 11 feet 1 .1-5 inches. Hall of
Oakland High School established a new
coast record for the high jump, his fig
ures. 6 feet 2 34-100 inches, replacing
those made b*y Patterson of the Uni
versity of California in 1195. Dodsfon
of Lick established a new coast inter
scholastic record in the half-mile, cov
ering: the distance in 2:04 1-5. while
Maundrell of Lowell lowered the league
record for one mile to 4:38 4-5. Vogel
inan of Modesto ran the classic "hun
dred"' in 10 1-5 seconds, tying the
academic record.
AH these performances will bear com
parison with those of athletes of any
age .the world over. Oakland High
School won the championship with a
trrtal-of 25 points. Berkeley High School
was second with 20% points, Lick
School third with 19 and Modesto fourth
with \%V 2 .
That Northern California is rich in
its athletic prospects is shown by the
wide area from which the winners were
drawn. Modesto sent two, Palo Alto
one, Ukiah three, Oakland two, Berke
ley two. Lick School of this city three
and Lowell one.
The relay race was run to the custom
ary acconipaniment of hysterical cries
ol the adherents of the teams. Oakland
had a lead varying from one to ten
yards in the first four laps. Berkeley
then assumed command and won ulti
mately by a small margin. Lick fin
ished third, but was disqualified, as twu
of its runners did not touch hands.
McLrimsey, a graceful hurdler from
I'kiah, fell at the last jump in the final
of the 120-yard race, thus spoiling a
great contest with Dozier. They ran
stride for stride throughout. That they
are evenly matched was shown in the
220-yard race, when they ran a dead
htat. The day's results in detail:

UNCLE'S PLAYERS AGAIN NOSED OUT BY ONE RUN
Henley Becomes Wild and
a Combination of Errors
Aids the Portlanders
Portland won again from the Seals
yesterday at Recreation Park by tak
ing advantage of Henley's wildness in
the fifth and by a combination of er
rors. When that spasm was ended the
scorer rang up three runs^ â all the
Giants secured, but enough to win.
The Seals secured a run in the first
and another in the third, but failed
to connect safely at opportune nÂ»o
ments. Hardly had the game opened
when Walters made a sensational one
handed grab after a long run, cutting
off what looked like a sure two-sack
er by McLean. In the fourth McLean
tore off another drive and this time
Spencer did the larceny act.
The outfield was busy, Hildebrand
getting: all three putouts in the eighth.
He also picked a high foul out of the
bleachers and had a total of six put
outs. Walters had four and Van Bu
ren three.
Garvin was steady all through the
game, striking out nine men and al
lowing but one walk. Henley gave
three walks and struck out only one
player. The Giant's benders fooled
three of Frisco's heaviest hitters in
the seventh spasm, when Irwin, Nea
lon and Qochnauer took three biffs
each without touching the leather.
The Portland bunch began the run
getting in the fifth, when Henley gave
Householder and SAz tickets to first.
Clark's fast hit over second followed,
scoring Householder. Atz going to
third and Clark to second on Wil
son's error of Walters' throw. Run
kle flew out to the pitcher, and Wil
son caught Garvin'a attempted bunt.
Then Gochnauer muffed a screamer
by Van Buren, allowing Atz and Clark
to register.
The spasm was ended by Spencer
returning McCreedie's hit and catch
ing Van Buren at the rubber. Score:

GRANDEST MARINE VIEW LOTS IN THÂ»
r CITT.
Sutro Heights Addition is the conneoting
link between the Golden Gate Park and Sutro
Heights.
-It comprises seven blocks between Fulton
street and Sutro Heights avenue, 46th and 49th
avenues, and is surely the most unique tract
of land evÂ«r offered .in subdivisions.
ThlÂ« is the only property adjacent to th*
ocean and Golden Gate Park where streets
are on official grades and macadamized.
EETvER, WATER AND GAB MAINS LAID.
Grandest marine view property In all th*
city; no other city in the .United States, or,
perhap*, the world affords residence sites I
with such elevation; unobstructed marine and
scenic views and â so . close to the pleasure-
grounds of the people. It faces the Golden
Gate Park, the ocean and adjoins' Sutro
Heights, Butro Baths and Cliff House.
This Is not the marine view advertised so : â 
indiscriminately, a marine view â¢at a great
distance, a mile â or two off, but it Is the '
grandest marine view of the ooean, only a
few hundred feet from your lot. You have It
right In front of you; you can see and hear
the rolling and roaring of the breakers of the
great Pacific.
ALL LARGE â 80-foot frontages â th* |
special feature of this tract Is â¢It gives . op-
portunity for a better class .< of residences. (
Several beautiful homes are contracted . for
and will be In course of construction shortly. -
Did you ever realize that they are only a
few blocks north of Golden Gate Park, so near
the ocean, and that evÂ«ry lot sold â¢ means 1 a
choice lot less to be had and makes yours
more valuable? â ' â '.; .. '-; i*-~';V Ââ¢ '\ -.' - v : â¢

I stocks following the leader up. The Ophlr
quotation Is said to be the highest for any

LONDON. April S. â The Torrey-
Alexander mission for the conversion
U rich in the West End closed a
iays ago. After a short rest the
-;can revivaliets will start a re
lieioup campaign among the poor and
lowly of the modern Babylon. For
more than five weeks they labored
ajnong those who. according to scrip
ture, have the hardest time of It gret
r.to heaven. What has the har
vest been ?
That is an exceedingly difficult
question to answer definitely. London
ie guch a vast place that only tre
mendously big things make any im
pression on the surface current of its
life. But one thing has been made
abundantly plain. Dives does not
manifest religion as Lazarus does. He
does not weep in public for his sins
or shout aloud for joy when he finds
salvation. None of the scenes that
have attended the Welsh revival have
witnessed at Albert Hall. Ac
cording to all accounts the upper
ciasse6 now comport themselves much
as they did before the American In
vaders undertook to put the fear of
Ood in their hearts and win them over
to a simple Christian life. Bridge
playing has not declined in popular
ity; the theaters are filled; swell res
taurants do not suffer from lack of
patronag-e: fashionable milliners and
dressmaker? still flourish; there have
been no signs of a flump in any of
those trades and occupations that are
maintained by supplying the luxuries
rather than the necessities of life.
On the other hand, the predictions
of cynical skeptics that the revival in
the West End would fall flat after the
. -y of the thing had worn off have
not been verified. So far as attend
affords a criterion the mission
has been a great success â an unprece
dentt - Nigiit after night
throughout successive weeks the big
hall has held audiences of from nine
to ten thousand. At the day meet
he attendance has averaged be
- â  and seven thousand. And
this has gone or. since the newspa-
pers ceased paying much attention to
the work. Most of the people seen
nt the services have the appearance
of being at least fairly well to do.
proportion of them belong to
the exclusive circles cannot be deter
mined by glancing over them. Soci
ety does not don its best bib and tuck
er to hear the gospel preached by
evangelists. It is different when it
goes to fashionable churches on Sun-
TORREY IS PLEASED.
Dr. Torrey asserts that the results
â  I his expectations. As to
many have been actually convert
. - has no means, he says, of gaug
ing accurately. Counting those who
had come to the inquiry rooms after
the meetings and there "accepted
Christ."' the number was altogether
t 2500. It was a week ago that he
gave these figures. Some five or six
hundred have since been added to the
f th<>se who have acknowledged
that they have found salvation. As to
the social .status of his converts Dr.
y is discreetly reticent. How many
â¢ -,g to the aristocracy he will not
If he knows. But he has made the
interesting statement that the first con
vert he made in London â the first per
m fact, to stand up at the opening
1 meeting in Albert Hall â was "a colonel
and a nobleman's son." According to
mission workers his name is
< nel Beauc-hamp.
We have had far more success than
-xpected among the society
it..' says Dr. Torrey. "They drop in
out of curiosity, perhaps, but they
again and again, and it is not
that attracts them then. The
thing that makes them difficult to
deal with Is their hatred of publicity.
They do not like to stand up before the
Whole hail and come right along."
Dr. Torrey prides himself on appeal
ing to the reason rather than the feel
ings of his auditors. The demonstra
tions that usually attend revival meet
ings haÂ» ? e been conspicuously absent
frojn the Albert Hall services. He says
he doesn't want scenes. "I don't go
â¢trong on emotionalism anyway," he
puts it. Society folk are in hearty ac
cord with him there. What bothers
them is the puritanism â the abandon
ment of luxurious pleasures â which Dr.
Torrey insists are the outward and vis
ible signs of an inward grace. A Church

rather patronizingly of the mission as
"deserving of some real sympathy from
all decent churchmen," says: "One
main fact about this mission is quite
certain â namely, that the immense ma
jority of the great audiences is drawn
from the attendants at nonconformist
places of worship â at least 90 per cent,
if not more. The remaining 10 per cent
are drawn from evangelical or nebulous
churchmen and from idlers."
MISSION A FAILURE.
This is tantamount to asserting that
the "West End Mission^ has completely
failed in its main purpose â that of get
ting the "upper classes" interested in
religion. But this view of it is flatly
contradicted by the opinion of J. H.
Putterill, the secretary of the evangel
ical council, which is running the re
vival. No one Is in a better position to
j get inside Information. "It is not true,"
he told me, "tnat our audiences have
j been drawn almost exclusively from
the nonconformist sects. The interest
which society people have manifested
i in our meetings has far surpassed our
i expectations. They are not content
â¢with coming once âthey come again
and again. At the present time, within
j a fortnight of the close of the mission,
I the demand for tickets of admission
from the best society of London is
I higher than it has been at any other
I time. We have adopted the course of
! reserving pertain stalls and boxes, tick
ets for which could only be obtained
through written applications, that we
might know who sought them. And we
j know that among those who have
; taken the deepest interest in our mis
j sion are some of the highest in the
I land."
Putterill would give no names, but
he intimated that if he were free to
do so it would astonish folk who were
asserting that no effect had been pro
duced by the mission among the aris
tocra< y.
"Does that include royalty also?" I
asked.
"1 have made no reference to the
King or the royal family," said Put
terill.
