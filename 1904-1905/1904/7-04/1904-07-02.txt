GALVESTON. Tex.. July 1. â Harry
Meyer, the 17-year-old son of Colonel
and Mrs. J. W. Meyer of Belton, met
with a most horrible death last night.
The young man, who was working in
the power-house at Belton in order to
secure a practical knowledge of elec
trical engineering, slipped and fell on
a shaft. Although he struggled with
all his might to release himself, his
prostrate position rendered his ef
forts futile and when he realized that
he was being borne to a terrible death
he uttered pitiful cries for help,' but
no one could hear him. His fellow
workmen saw him going through tha
death trap and some ran to his as
sistance, while others stopped the ma
chinery, but all were too late. When
the body was liberated it was found
that the unfortunate lad's back and
neck were broken and that he was
terribly mutilated.
The deceased belonged to one of the
wealthiest and most aristocratic fam
ilies in the State.

CONSTANTINOPLE, July LâTur
kish duplicity is playing havoc with
the refugees of the recent massacres
at Sassoun. After the palace had tele
graphed the Governor General of Blt
lls to establish the Armenians on the
plain of Mush, the council of Ministers,
pretending acquiescence in foreign
pressure, directed that those who liked
should be permitted to return to their
villages among the mountains. Those
villages, however, no longer exist. The
homes to which the outcasts received
permission to return- have long since
vanished in smoke.
Th*e refugees massed on the plain of
Mush are mostly women, children and
old men. The majority of the able
bodied men who opposed the troops
have been killed or have fled. The
refugees, reduced by hunger and hard
ship, are without means of traveling
and are completely destitute. â¢

GALVESTON, Tex., July 1.â Julian
Renfro, the young negro whose sensa

Chicago was duly chronicled by the
papers all over the country, recovered
his speech this afternoon at his home,
where he has been quietly living ever
since his return from Chicago and New
Orleans, where several specialists in

According to eye-witnesses Renfro's
restoration . to speech was equally as
sensational as the loss. Last week Ren
fro wrote on a slip of paper in reply to
a question as to when he expected to
regain his speech that he would regain
it this afternoon at 3 o'clock. How he
knew this or why he was so certain of
the fact is not vouchsafed. Precisely
at the hour mentioned and with the
members of his family ranged about
him. confldent,that the prediction would
come true, Renfro opened his lips and
shouted, rather than uttered, the words,
"The Lord be praised." The assembled
friends and relatives set up a wild,
emotional shouting. Renfro's lips con
tinued to work, and those nearest him
heard the words of the twenty-third
Psalm. Fervent prayers and thanks
giving for the young negro came from
those present.

PORTLAND, Ore., July 1.â In a
twenty-five-foot single sticker two
Portland schoolboys have started on a
voyage for Honolulu by way of San
Francisco. Late this evening they ar
rived at Astoria and to-morrow early
will see them on the sea.
Glen D. Cayler and Harry Kinney are
the youths who will attempt a feat
never yet undertaken in so frail a
craft. Glen Is the captain and pro
moter of the scheme, while his chum,
Harry, is the crew, though he is the
owner of the craft in which the voyage
Is to be made. The captain's father is
a 'prominent wholesale commission
man, and the boy has stocked the
yacht with all necessaries from money
he has earned himself. The boys
moored the little craft beneath the Jef
ferson-street bridge on June 23, and
harid-over-hand lowered their small
stock of supplies with the aid of ropes.
The loading took most of the day.
Next morning the lads induced the
owners of a launch to give them a lift
to the mouth of the Willamette. When
last, seen they were sailing down the
Columbia on Monday morning. At that
time everything was going nicely.
Twice since the departure of the lit
tle craft, which is named The Portland,
Mr. Cayler has received letters from
his son. One of these communications,
from St. Helens, was made at that
town on the 25th. It contained about
twenty-five words and. said everything
was "O. K.* 1 ''

result alone from the administration

theory the police are disposed to accept.

It is a generally accepted theory along

bagged and robbed of his money, but
that his papers were left on him in
order that he might be picked up and
sent out on the transport. ;
As there were no outward bruises of
any kind it is said that the conditions
disclosed by the autopsy would not re

BERLIN, July 1. â The^ question of
mediation between Russia and Japan
on behalf of peace continues to be dis

Tageblatt quotes the utterances of -mi
unnamed diplomatist having utose re
lations with Japan as saying that
Japan Is disposed to accept the medi
ation of some friendly power and
would propose peace conditions that
Russia could accept. Conditions could
be framed easily, since Japan does not
seek territorial acquisitions in Man
churia, but only wants the preserva
tion of her commercial interests there
and a certain influence in Korea. Hav
ing already substantially improved her
moral position with European pow
ers through the victories hitherto
won, Japan would gladly utilize the
situation thus created for establishing
peace before Russia reinforces her
Manchurian army too strongly. This
diplomatist further argues that Rus
sia, after having gained one important
victory, would consent to mediation
because the war has demonstrated
that she is unnble to cope with Japan
with her existing military equipment
and needs ten years for reorganization
and rearmament before renewing ths
struggle. Hence the war will soon
come to an end.

LOS ANGELES, July 1. â Los An
geles was connected this evening with
what will be, when completed, the
largest electrical generating and dis
tributing plant in this country outside
of Niagara: From" Kern River over a
transmission line 128 miles long now
run three wires carrying 4 5,000 volts
of electricity and, as soon as an addi
tional power station Is completed
there, which will be within the next
month, the voltage will be increased
to 65,000, an energy which is sufficient
to generate 20,000 horsepower and
which is potential enough to supply
nearly all the towns in Southern Cal
ifornia with electricity.
The line has been completed by the
Kern River Light and Power Company,
a Huntington corporation, from the
power station at Borel, on the Kern
River, where the current is generated
by means of huge turbines turned un
der pressure of water taken from the
river twelve miles farther up the

Not a single large vessel, it is added,
was damaged.
On. the evening Of June 26, fifteen
miles from Port Arthur, two Japanese
regiments, the advices further say,
were ambushed by Russian infantry,
who allowed the' Japanese to approach
within 400 yards. The Japanese at
tacked three times, getting to within
sixty yards of the Russians, but each
time they were repulsed. Later, be
ing reinforced by two other regiments,
the Japanese compelled the Russians
to fall back to their fortifications. The
total Japanese loss was a thousand
men. The Russian loss at Dalin Pass
on June 27 was eighty men killed.
The Japanese losses were heavier.

June 30:
. "A report received to-day from the
acting commander of the Port Arthur

dated June 30:
"The . following reports have reached

cruiser, two torpedo-boat destroyers
and seven merchant ships, which evi
dently brought cargoes into the bay.
"On the night of June 24-25 the
Japanese torpedo-boats reapproached
the fortress and at 4 a. m. on June 26
the enemy began to cannonade from
their vessels In Siaopingtao Bay, di
recting their fire against the whole
coast toward the north, from the bay
to Mount Uitselo, and then attacked In
great force, firstly Height No. 131; sec
ondly Height No. 126. 'Â¦;',.
"The latter were attacked by a small
detachment landed for this purpose.
These two heights were held by our
riflemen, who, after driving off three
attacks with heavy losses, retired and,
being pressed . by the enemy, sought
refuge on the heights of Lounvantian.
TJie enemy attacked this position in
great force, employing at least a divis
ion, but all the assaults were repulsed.
"At 3:30 p.m. the Japanese appeared
on the Port Arthur road in great
strength and attacked Kwinshan
(Guinsanshan). The riflem/n, who held
the height with two battalions, retired.
The Japanese turned them from the
rear, losing heavily in the maneuver.
Our torpedo boats were of some as
sistance to us, advancing on Lounvan
tian and bombarding the coast occu
pied by the enemy.
"Our losses were seven officers and
about 200 soldiers killed or wounded.
Our. mines exploded at the proper time,
blowing up at least fifty Japanese.
Their losses were evidently consider
able.
"According to the latest advices;
large columns of the enemy are march
ing from Dalny toward the village of
Suantsanhon and Khouint Mountain.
"On June 27 there was a fusillade at

The Centra Costa Water Company
brought suit yesterday against James
B. Barber, Tax Collector of Alameda
County, to restrain him from selling
the property belonging to the plaintiffs
for delinquent taxes.
The case came up before Judge Gra
ham, who granted the plea of the plain
tiffs and Issued the order. A bond of
$"5,000 was required and furnished. The
case has been assigned to Judge Mu
rasky, the return day being July 11.
The property was advertised to be sold
to-day.
The cause that led up to the suit is
the refusal of the water company to
pay taxes upon Its property on the
basis of the valuation placed upon it
by Henry P. Dalton, Assessor of Ala
meda County. He placed the value of
the franchise at $1200, and on their
property in and about and including
Lake Chabot at $600,000.
The Assessor takes as an authority
for the basis upon which he forms the
valuation of these properties the or
dinances passed in 1866 and 1872. The
water company contends that these or
dinances are superseded by the amend
ments to the constitution passed In
18S4, as per section 19, article XI, State
constitution. This act, the. company
claims, permits anybody to lay pipes
for public use in the public streets.
Such pipes shall not be assessed as per
sonal property. .Â¦ _.-\
Regarding the Lake Chabot property,
the water company contends that inso
much as it owns all the property
in and about and surrounding the lake
the water in the lake is legally a por
tion of the real estate.
The suit was filed In this city because
the principal place of business of the
water company Is located here.

KUROKI'S ARMY ACTIVE.
Japanese Forces Pushing on Through
the Mountain Passes.
LIAOYANG, July L^General Kuro
patkin and General Kurokl are moving
their troops like men on a chessboard.
The Japanese are now twenty miles
from Liaoyang. Rains are impeding
their movements. Detachments total
ing 1200 men have been detailed from
General Renenkampff's Cossacks . to
scout defiles and hills, harassing the
Japanese and not allowing them any
rest, day or night. The Japanese artil
lery is said to be commanded by an
American. His tall form is frequently
seen with the batteries.
Kuroki's army is extremely active
east of the Russian position and the
Russians are correspondingly vigilant.
The Russian center is rapidly pushing
northward to a point where Kuropat
kin established his base after the battle
of Vafangow. As .far as the Russians
know, Kurokl is steadily, pushing on
ward through x he mountain passes,
even toward Mukden. Preparations at
all points are now practically complete.
The demc-nstrations made during the
last few days against the Russian left
flank threaten completely to change the
position of the two armies.
Notwithstanding four da * rain the
troops are still moving.' Some railroad
trains with wounded passed north on

Los Angeles Man Declares Revenge
SAYS SENATOR BURTOy
IS PERSECUTING HIM
Prompts Effort to Punish
Him In Court.
LOS ANGELES. July . 1. â C. H
Brooks, owner of the Van Nuys Broad
way Hotel, formerly of St. Louis, has
been held for removal to that city by
the United States authorities to answer
an indictment returned by the United
States Grand Jury charging him with
using the mails for fraudulent pur
poses. The charge grows out of
Brooks* alleged connection with a get
rich-qulck concern known as the Na
tional , Securities Company, that oper
ated on a large scale and in its opera
tions involved some prominent people.
If what Brooks says is true his
trial will be productive of some sen
sational features. He asserts that
United States Senator Burton, who
was recently convicted of bribery in
connection with the company. Is be
hind the present efforts to prosecute
him because he (Brooks) was obliged
to dlvulcre certain information which
contributed largely to the conviction
of Burton.
He further declares that the indict
ment has been held up for more than
a year, that after It was returned he
passed the United States District At
torney at St. Louis many times and
no effort was made to arrest hfm. This,
he asserts, was part of Burton's plan
to secure a hold on those who knew of
his dealings and thus make it unsafe
for them to appear at Burton's trial.
Brooks has given bond and will be
ready to leave for St. Louis whenever
an officer comes for him.

RUSSIA IS DETERMINED.
Reverses to Her Arras Make Her
Thirst for Revenge on Japanese.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 1.âDis
patches from Washington saying that
Inquiries made by the Government as
to the possibility of mediation show
that neither Russia nor Japan is in a
humor to entertain overtures, but that
the State Department is ready to offer
its services in the interest of m~'iiation
whenever they may be acceptable, are
attracting considerable attention 'n
Government and diplomatic circles.
The optimistic opinions' attributed . to
official circles at Washington r: yard
ing the early opening of friendly offices
are not shared in Russia.
On the contrary, where vc- inquiries
have been made the opinion has been
unanimous that there is nothing in the
present situation, so far as Russia Is
concerned, on which to base an early
termination of the war, and that the
question of peace will be considered
only when direct proposals have been
made by Japan.
Russia has announced her determina
tion not to tolerate mediation, and this
determination seems to be rather
strengthened than shaken by the re
verses to her arms.
"There can be no mediation." the As
sociated Press was emphatically in
formed, "and any proposals looking to
peace must come from Japan. The
United States Government might be
come the medium through which pro
posals will be submitted for our con
sideration and of course any such pro
posal would be considered, but Russia
is not seeking good offices, and neither
the United States nor any other power
will be asked to a'ct as mediator."
ST. PETERSBURG. July 2. 4:20 a. m.
It is believed that the commencement
of the rainy season will materially af
fect the whole military situation. The
authorities believe that the rain great
ly lessens the probability of' an imme
diate decisive engagement between
General Kuropatkin and General Ku
rokl. and it is thought that the wet
weather will close the campaign in the
upper part of the Liaotung Peninsula
until good weather sets in. The Japa
nese will probably be forced to hold the
positions where the rain finds them as
best they can.
The operations around Port Arthur
doubtless will be seriously hampered.
It is believed the Japanese will find it
necessary to establish another base,
probably on the west coast of the lower
part of the Liaotung Peninsula, in or
der to bring in food supplies, especially
if the 10,000 troops reported to have
been landed on the Elliott Islands
march toward Port Arthur. ; . i.
The Japanese will probably be able
to utilize the time in making prepara
tions to push the siege on the resump
tion of fair weather, -i.; Â¦:'-â¢ ' ;-'. '-ir v; "Â¦". "Â¦
The lengthy report to the Czar from
Viceroy Alexieff detailing the rally of
the Port Arthur squadron on June 23
and the repulse of the Japanese torpedo
attack indicates that Rear Admiral
Withoeft was in no wise caught off his
guard. The explanation of the fact that
the squadron remained in the outer
roadstead throughout the night is that
the twenty-four foot tide at Port Ar
thur renders the channel impracticable
for vessels of deep draught at low tide.
There is much speculation as to the
exact position of the Port Arthur fleet,
the later dispatches from Lieutenant
General Zalinsky, chief of staff to Vice
roy Alexieff, bringing the reports from
the fortress up to two days after the
squadron was supposed to have gone
into the harbor, without mentioning the
vessels. If the squadron has again gone
out, as is popularly rumored, the au
thorities have-not disclosed the fact.

ST. PAUL, July 1.â When the Repub
lican State Convention was called to
gether this afternoon the credentials
committee not being ready to report,
the resolutions committee presented the
platform.
The first mention of President Roose
velt's name brought forth a tremendous
ovation, which was duplicated when
the plank indorsing Governor Van
Sant's action in fighting the. so-called
railroad merger was read. The indorse
ment of Senator Clapp for re-election
brought out the greatest demonstration
that has yet occurred in the conven
tion. The report was unanimously
adopted.
The platform, after reaffirming, the
national platform and commending the
administrations of McKInley and
Roosevelt, has the following to say on
national issues:
"We believe that the large corpora
tions, commonly called trusts, should
be regulated by law and supervised
both in their organization and opera-'
tions, that their tendencies may be
checked and their evil practices pre
vented, and Insist that they shall be so
regulated and controlled as to prevent
/nonopoly and promote competition, and
in the fullest measure subserve and ad
vance the public good.
"We believe in the doctrine of pro
tection' to American industry as set
forth in the national Republican plat
form of 1904, and we believe in reci
procity as defined and advocated by
William McKinley and James G.
Blaine."
The platform commends the action of
President Roosevelt and Governor Van
Sant In "espousing the cause of the
people against the railway merger and
trusts." It indorses Senators Nelson
and Clapp to succeed themselves; fa
vors good roads; solicits a better un-
Meet in State Convention and Adopt
a Strong Platform.

OMAHA, Nebr., July 1. â William
Jennings Bryan passed through Omaha
this morning on his way to fill two
engagements in Iowa before going to
St. Louis.
He expressed, great confidence in
Democratic success this fall.
"I look for a good candidate and a
good platform as the result of the con
vention," he said. "By a good plat
form I mean one that honestly and
without evasion states the Democratic
position on public questions. By a
good candidate I mean one who can
be enthusiastically supported by all
good Democrats. And by good Demo
crats I mean those who have In the
last campaigns aided the Democratic
fight against plutocracy. Under these
conditions I consider there Is an excel
lent chance to elect a Democratic
President. The Republican platform
advocates a higher tariff than ever be
fore. Apart from this It does not pre
sent a single Issue clearly. I am hop-
Ing that our convention will so act
that Democratic courage can be con
trasted with Republican cowardice."

Justices of the Supreme CourtâCal

Senator Moses E. Clapp, who presid
ed, brought about the harmony by In
sisting that contests be fought out in
the committee on credentials. While
contests were not settled by the com
mittee, all talk of bolting was done
away with, so that when a minority re
port was adopted unseating 113 dele
gates favorable to Justice Collins for
Governor the unseated delegates left
the hall, pledging their support to
whichever ticket might be named.
After the unseating was completed it
became evident that Dunn had a large
majority. Congressman Eddy with
drew from the race and the name of
Collins was not presented.
Dunn's nomination was made by ac
clamation.
As the convention indorsed Senator
Clapp for re-election it seems probable
that no one will seriously contest his
return to the Senate.

is a little talk about what Wil
liam J. Bryan may do, but some strong
assurances are given that he will not
bolt. A topic of discussion also Is what
the convention may do with Bryan. It
is expected that he will have a vigorous
dissent to the platform and possibly to
the candidate, but some Democrats say
that after expressing his dissent it is
not the intention of the leaders to allow
any great latitude to him after his
minority report has been rejected.

FRIENDS OF JUDGE PARKER.
ST. LOUIS, July 1.â Longer In ad
vance than usual the platform ques
tion Is receiving the serious considera
tion of delegates and others interested
In the party's welfare and it is already
evident that there will be a persistent
effort to secure an expression of party
views which will meet the approval of
all factions.
"We must get a pronouncement
which will meet the demands of all
Democrats," said Representative Clay
ton of Alabama, "and I believe it is
going to be a comparatively easy mat
ter to accomplish that result."
Other party leaders on the ground
expressed themselves in like optimistic
manner. But when they entered upon
a comparison of views it became evi
dent that there are differences whic^
will have to be smoothed down before
the desired result can be secured.
Evidently the principal contention
will be over the point as to whether
there shall be a specific declaration
favorable to affirmation of the prin
ciples enunciated In the platforms of
1S96 and 1900. There is to-day some
strenuous contention as po whether
there shall be any reference whatever
to those two declarations, and there
are many shades of views as to how
the subject should be covered.
Delegates who are close to Bryan
want a reaffirmation in terms, but
some of them are content to say that,
while making the reassertion, they con
sider other and newer questions o-f
leading importance and are willing on
that account to give more prominence
to them. Others take the position that
it would be invidious to mention the
Chicago and Kansas City utterances
and urge that it will be sufficient to
reaffirm the principles enunciated by
all previous Democratic conventions
and then pass to the consideration of
newer questjons. A third class would
have all references to recent party
declarations entirely omitted.
Some express the opinion that the
preparation of the platform will be
left almost entirely to Senator Gorman
and Representative Williams, the Dem
ocratic leaders in the two houses of
Congress. It is generally believed that
the character of the platform will have
a marked Influence upon the Presiden
tial nomination, and as only a majority
vote is required for its adoption its
exact wording will be awaited with*
much interest.
John B. Walker of New York is
urging the adoption of a financial
plank declaring for currency so ad
justed as to meet all business require
ments.
ENJOYING THEIR TRIP.
California Delegates to St. Louis Will
Reach There To-Day.
BY Ali McCABE.
KANSAS CITY, July 1.â The Callfor
nia'delegates to the Democratic Nation
al Convention are still industriously
engaged in promoting the candidacy of
.their chosen candidate for President.
The members of the delegation never
lose an opportunity to give vent to
their now well-known convention yell,
and are pinning Hearst buttons on all
unsuspecting citizens along the road.
At Colorado Springs, Pueblo and other.
Colorado points considerable crowds
were assembled and shouts for Hearst,
California and Colorado were loud and
long. At Dodge City, Kans., an hour
passed so quickly that the delegates are
sore about it yet. In fact, they did not
know a thing about It until the porter
told them this morning to, set their
watches an hour ahead. This Is the
second hour since the trip commenced
in which no opportunity was afforded
to shout for Hearst.
At Topeka, Kans., a number of the
unterrified had gathered and joined in
shouts for Hearst. Rather an amusing
Secretary Morton knows absolutely
nothing of naval administration. Ex
perience has shown that this absence
of knowledge is an aid rather than a
detriment to a new Secretary-. The busi
ness knowledge which most successful
Secretaries have brought to the Navy
Department is possessed by Morton in
a large degree. It has advanced him
to a prominent position in the railway
business and it is expected will make
his administration a highly successful
one.
The outgoing of Moody was marked
by a general regret on the part of the
department officials, who realize his
strength and the beneficial features of
the naval policy during his administra
tion.
WASHINGTON, July 1.â At the Cabi
net meeting to-day William H. Moody
moved up to the chair formerly occu
pied by Attorney General Knox, and
Paul Morton of Illinois took the seat
Moody has for the last two years occu
pied as Secretary of the Navy.
To-day General (now Senator) Knox,
although no longer a Cabinet Minister,
was in attendance. Former Repre
sentative Victor H. Metcalf of Califor
nia did not arrive in time to attend the
Cabinet n.eeting. He took the oath of
office as Secretary of Commerce and
Labor at the' -White House at 4:30
o'clock. He succeeds George B. Cortel
you in that position. The Cabinet
meeting was the las.t of the season.
President Roosevelt had a long talk
with his advisers on general topics, and
especially the political situation. He
leaves for Oyster Bay to-morrow morn
ing, to remain there until July 28.
Moody took the oath of office as At
torney General at 9 o'clock. When E.
P. Hanna, solicitor of the Navy De
partment, addressed the oath of office
to Morton at 9:50 o'clock General
Moody turned to his successor and
said: "I sincerely congratulate you,
Mr. Secretary, upon your advent into
this office. You will come into daily
contact with some of the finest sailors
in the world."

CHANDLER IS ACQUITTED.
London was the birthplace of George
Frederick Watts. He was born in the
English metropolis February 23, IS 17,
and most of his days were spent in
the foggy city. He became known as
an artist of considerable skill even in
his young days, but it was not until
1S37, when he was 20 years of age,
that his . pictures were exhibited in
the Royal Academy. From that year
his fame steadily increased until with
in a few years he was known as the
foremost artist of England, if not of
the world. His portrait work won
him the highest honors, though his
allegorical pictures added not a little
to his reputation as a master of art.
Through his long life Watts was
more or less of a philanthropist. Hun
dreds of his paintings adorn the walls
of public buildings in England and a
great many of these were the gift of
the painter. The Academy Commis
sioners thought so much of his work
that â¢ they bought a number of his
portraits and cartoons. Watts was
idolized by the English people and he
numbered among his friends the
greatest people of Europe. In 1897,
when he was -SO years of age, he was
tendered a banquet, at which he was
presented with a congratulatory ad
dress signed by hundreds of the fore
most men of the world.
In IS 80 the honorary degree of
D. C. L. was conferred upon Watts by
Oxford University and in 18 S3 the
University of Cambridge conferred
upon him the degree of LL. D. In
1885 Gladstone was empowered to
confer a baronetcy upon the painter,
but this honor was declined. Watts
was a member of a number of foreign
academies and wore the Cross of the
Legion of Honor.
LONDON. July 1. â George Fred
erick Watts, the painter, died of
bronchitis to-day.
â¢ 'DENVER, July 1. â Justice Robert
!W. Steele of the Colorado State Su

Michael Versey, 12 years old, and
living at 17 Vandewater street, yester
day afternoon received a deep lacerat
ed wound on the lower lip and lost two
teeth .while playing in the Children's
Playground at Eighth and Harrison
streets. He was amusing himself by
swinging on one of the horizontal bars
when another suddenly released a
swing, which hit young Versey in the
face. He waa treated at the Emer
gency Hospital by Chief Surgeon John
I. Stephen. The sufferer stood the
ordeal manfully, not once wincing
when the needle was forced through
the flesh.
The amount of money received for
licenses during June was $30,785 50.
This shows an increase of $2284 50
over the corresponding month of last
year. There is on deposit with the
license office the sum of $2237. This
amount has been paid in by different
theaters and as permits have* not as
yet been granted by the Board of Pub

Ryan leaves a wife, a daughter, Mrs.
Alfred Collier, and two sisters, Mrs.
Oliver P. Evans and Mrs. Charles A.
Werden. His widow left St. Louis to
night, bringing his remains to San
Francisco, where the funeral will take
place.
Joseph ~R. Ryan was for a number
of years superintendent of the Con.
Virginia and California, Hale & Nor
cross and Ophir mines of Virginia
City, Nev., and was recently elected
superintendent also of the Mexican
and the Andes. In addition to these re
sponsibilities he was manager of the
great pumping plant on the Comstock.
Ryan was born in Roxbury, Mass.,
August 23, 1848. He came with his
mother to California in 1852 to join
his father, the Hon. James Talbot
Ryan, who preceded them hither in
1850. He was educated at Santa Clara
College, where he distinguished him
self by his histrionic ability. : For
about thirty-five years he had been
identified with mining interests in Vir
ginia City; at one time he was assayer
for the bonanza mines and was Presi
dent Cleveland's first appointee on this
coast as coiner of the Carson Mint.
Ryan left Virginia City with his wife
on June 22 to attend the Democratic
National Convention, to which he waa
a delegate, being also the . national
committeeman from Nevada. He was
chairman of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee for many ye,ars, and
when urged by the press of Nevada to
be a candidate for the United States
Senate it was said: "To him more than
any other man in Nevada is due the
fact that the State is Democratic to
day and that It is represented by a
Democratic instead of two Repub
licans, as has been the case ever since
it was admitted Into the Union a third
of a century ago."
When a mere lad he saved two other
boys from drowning in Humboldt
Bay, one of whom was George A.
Knight. It was a coincidence that
both Knight and Ryan were national
corrimitteemen of the great parties this
year.

ST. LOUIS, July 1. â Joseph Ryan,

died to-day at the Jefferson Hotel of
pneumonia.
Ryan and his wife came to St. Louis
direct from their home at Virginia
City, Nev., . Monday. It was their in
tention to spend several days viewing
the fair before the opening of the con
vention. Ryan, however, contracted a
cold en route and when he reached St.
Louis was quite ill. He never left his
rooms at the hotel. His physicians
pronounced his case pneumonia, but a
a serious result was not anticipated.
During the night, however, Ryan
grew much worse and it became evi
dent that he could not recover. Mrs.
Ryan remained by his bedside all
night. With her was Mrs. William E.

JOSEPH R. RYAN. A PROMINENT
NEVADA MINING MAN, WHO
DIED AT ST. LOUIS.
There has, been tampering with the
records of the late firm of Eppinger &
j Co. 'Just who did the tampering has
! not developed as yet, nor has the time
of the act been settled. In addition to
other methods of doing business the
firm had a system of "loose leaf" rec
ords. They were so loose that the .rec
! ords for ninety options for lots in ware
houses are among the missing. They
are important documents, according to
the bearing they have on the case at
bar, and there is to be considerable
probing to find out just how nearly
Criminal the loose system was. W. W.
: Topping, the former bookkeeper of the
firm, says the book was locked and the
records safe, but in some mysterious
or loose manner the documents escaped
from between the covers, although he
had the key. This occurred just before
or after the failure. Topping could not
remember many things. He did remem
ber that the loose system should show
ninety more options than it did, but he
could not say what became of them.
At the opening of the morning ses
sion Topping returned to the stand and
identified a book offered in evidence
showing the receipts of grain during
the year 1902-3. j
"Can the leaves be readily removed
from this book?" asKed Attorney
Campbell.
"Yes."
"The book contains a record of but
fifty-eight option lots; yesterday you j
said there were 148, wny does not the
memoranda of the other ninety lots ap
pear in that book?"
"The only explanation I can offer is
that they were not hyppthecated."
"Is it not a fact that there were other
entries in this book, up to June 1,
1903?"
"I don't remember."
ENTRIES ARE MISSIXG.
"Will you say that it did not con
tain a list of all the lots in the Pacific j
Coast Warehouse with the names of
the people to whom the grain was de
livered or hypothecated?"
"I don't remember."
"Can, you tell that ninety entries are
missing?" . . . .'
"That is a fact."
Attorney Campbell then closed the
book and asked the witness. if it were
locked, to which Topping replied in the
affirmative. .The key to the book, he
said, was usually kept in his drawer.
He did not know just who might have
access to it during his absence, as the
drawer was never locked, but no one
save himself had any particular occa
sion to use the drawer.
Most of the afternoon session was oc
cupied in an argument as to the ad
missibility of the cargo invoice book,
which shows the amount of grain ship-'
ped away durina the year. The de
fense claimed that a question had been
raised as to the right of the court to
retain possession of any of the books
and until it was decided nothing should
be read from them. The objection was
overruled, however. The book was ad
mitted in evidence and Topping pro
ceeded to read such entries as he had
made in It. These showed shipments
of about 50,000 tons of grain to differ
ent ports during the last year the firm
was in business. Entries made by
others have not yet been read.
During the day there was an inter
esting controversy regarding the cus- i
tody of the books. In the argument At- I
torney Campbell said that, although I
the books were physically in the posses
sion of the court, they were construct
ively in the possession of the trustee in j
bankruptcy, as they were open to the
inspection of any one who cared to see
them.
: WOULD KEEP BOOKS.
Attorney Friedenrich, representing
Trustee Wadsworth, said that the
books had been procured from a clerk
employed by Wadsworth without his j
consent when they were in actual pos- I
session of the Federal court and could !
not lawfully be removed without its
consent. The trustee, he said, never
consented to allow the books to leave
his possession and never would con
sent. Judge Lawlor reserved his de
cision and the matter will be further
argued Tuesday afternoon. In the
meantime the contents of the books
are being read before the Jury.
Another phase of the-case came up
in the Federal court when Attor
ney Henry Ach appeared yesterday |
morning before United States Dis
trict Judge de Haven and pre
sented a petition signed by Ja
cob Eppinger. The petition asked
that Attorney J. C. Campbell and Po- ]
lice Detective Thomas B. Gibson be!
adjudged guilty of contempt of court'
and punished for having, without per
mission of the court or of Henry Wads
worth; the trustee of the bankrupt Ep
pinger estate, taken away one storage
book, one pass book, one letter book
and certain canceled checks and other
papers. The petition accuses Campbell
and Gibson of having "conspired and
co.lluded together" for the purpose of
taking the books and papers.
Judge de Haven denied the motion.
He said that the trustee was the proper
person to make such a motion, the doc
uments-being in his custody. Mr. Ach
took an exception to the ruling of the
court.

That the Firm Failed
Activity at Dredge, on the Sacra
mento River, near Folsom, Is reported
by the Folsom Telegraph, which says
in substance:
There is much activity at the Folsom Devel
opment Company's work* at Dredge. In the
mai-hine shops the machinery for Dredge No. 3
is being turned out as rapidly as possible.
Several pieces of new machinery have re
cently been Installed and a few more compe
tent mechanic* have been employed. W. H.
Watts ha* a large force of men at work con
tracting the hull of Dredge No. 3. The new
dredfje will be if larger capacity than any now
op#ratÂ»;d by the company and will have many
improvements over the others. It is the inten
tion to make each dredge a little better than
the last one. and thus it la expected that
dredge mining may be revolutionized.
The Cottonwood Advocate, published
at Cottonwood, Shasta County, pre
dicts that good dredging ground wiil
be discovered along the Cottonwood
Creek:
The. smaller gulches leading into the creek
and Its branches have been placer mined in
early days and the creek itself would pay to
work by the sluicing process If there 'wrre
sufficient fall Â¦ Parties report who have fror
pected the creek within half a mile of . Cot-
AMONG THE DREDGERS.
All the old companies continue on new work
vigorously and Ere increasing their production
accordingly. Nevertheless, the fear of over
production in this Held is very remote. TnÂ«
quality of the product assures a permanent
market at a fair figure. With three large buy
ers in the field, competition is sufficiently acute
to maintain prices, and there is very small
probability of the price going very much If any
below that now paid. viz.. 83 cents at the wel
and oil men are perfectly willing to drill for oil
here at this price, notwithstanding that in no
field In the State is drilling so expensive as
here. The average cost of a well Is between
$15.C0O and $20,000. And yet the scramble to
"get in" Is lively.
Among the leases recently made is one by
S A Johnson of Bakemfleld. who has secured
230 acres in the southern limit of the Barca
ranch. This adjoins the Puerisslma. ranch,
which is held by the Union Oil Company, and
on which three of the best wells In that sec
tion of the field are located. This is about
six miles north 6f Lompoc. Mr. Johnson has
Interested Los Angeles and San Francisco capi
tal with him and drilling will commence in
ninety days.
The Inyo Independent reports that
Inyo County is making a large stir in
mining. Morris Jacoby has acquired a
group of mines In the Beveredge dis
trict, including the Keynote. Reports
from Cactus Flat are good. A new
vein Is reported to have been discov
ered assaying ?200 a ton. Ore of good
grade Is reported to have been found in
several mines. The force of men on the
Forgot mine will be doubled this month.
F. M. Smith, F. C. Havens, F. H.
Rice, W. H. Brock and W. P. John
son have incorporated the ?.United
States Borax Company of West Vir
ginia in San Bernardino County. The
persons back of the company have re
cently had large tracts of land sur
veyed In Death Valley and have se
cured some new locations to add to
previously large holdings. The Ameri
can Borax Company has a greater out
put of borax than any other company
in the world.
The Los Angeles Herald says of the
operations of oil miners in the Santa
Maria field:
Tonopah Is to have a railway In op
eration to its mines. It Is announced
that the line will open for business this
month. The effect will be undoubtedly
to benefit Tonopah and Goldfleld. and
also Nevada at large. The superintend
ent of the road makes the following
statements to a correspondent at Reno:
We will put on at first one passenger a, day
in each direction, and enough freight trains to
handle all the ore that will b* offered us
for shipment. The latter Is the biggest prop
osition and although some of the Tonopah
mine owners are afraid that we cannot handle
all the ore offered us for transportation I
know that it will be promptly transported
provided that the connecting lines can tane
care of It as fast as we do. .
Under the new freight rates Mr. Trlpp says
that $40 ore can be transported to the smelters
at Salt Lake at a big profit. We will cut
tho cost of teaming ore fully two-thirds, ami
this will add a stimulus to mining that w.n
be wonderful. Many of the largest m nÂ«s In
Tcnopah are delaying development until they
fir; secure railroad transportation.

Some facts about the. mines of Tuol
umne County are supplied by the
Mother Lode Banner as follows:
Horatio Smith has sold to Mary E. Crock*r
the Rush Creek mine, situated In Santa Maria
district, together with tools, arastra and Im
provements. The shafts at the CryetalUne
have been connected. For a. distance or â o
feet explorations were made and the ore _so
uncovered proved of considerable value. Tne
mill is kept busy. Report has it that tne
Clio mine, which has been Idle several months^
has been bonded by a company and 1* to be
operated by George Stayton. rs^^^.n
J..1* Mendonca has given to E. M. Crandall
and J. J. Morris a bond on the Calico mine,
situated near Stcnt. payable in twelve months
This is the same mine operated at one time
by Arendt Bros. By another deed Crandall
and Morria transfer this agreement to the
New Calico Mining and Milling Company.
J. S. Kuns of Los Angeles has acquire* the
one-third interest of O. H. Lehmer In the
Phillips group of mines, situated next to he

John Walsh and Romeo Fabbri, mem
bers of the Hackmen's Union, r are ac
cused of assaulting W. D. Kent, driver
of a Palace .Hotel bus, at .Fifth and
Stevenson 'streets last Thursday night.
The complainant states that the only
provocation for the attack was the fact
of his being a non-union driver. The
defendants ran away and were over
taken and arrested- by Patrolman T. G.
Murphy. The case was called . before
Judge Mogan and continued till July 9.
Judge Megan sent Thomas McMahon
and H. A. Pafrks to the Superior Court
to stand trial on the charge of waylay
ing and robbing Louis Young of a
cheap watch and $2 cash. Their bail is
$2000 apiece.
Mamie Williams wore a khaki bifur
cated skirt and a cowboy hat tilted to
an angle of forty-five degrees when Pa
trolman Murphy picked her up and ran
her in for being unable to satisfactorily
explain why she was loitering on Post
street, near Stockton, at 2 o'clock yes
terday morning. She chewed gum as
she told Judge Mogan that If the po
liceman had not spoiled her programme
she would have started for the moun
tains on an early train to enjoy a
much-needed rest. Her case was con
tinued for a week to give the officer
time to find out something more about
her character*
C. H. Moosely, whose unlicensed
liquor dealing establishment at Green
wich and Lyon streets has been al
luded to by witnesses as a "speak
easy," a "blind pig" and a "hole in the
wall," wa? fined $100 by Judge Mogan.
Mr. Moosely demanded a Jury trial and
the Jury found him guilty as charged.
The case of Anna Speakman, charged
with attempting to kill Mrs. Clara Le
fevre by slashing her with a carving
knife, has been transferred from Judge
Mogan to Judge Conlan* and is set for
hearing before the latter magistrate on
July 15. Mrs. Lefevre is still confined
in a sanitarium on account of her
wounds. Her physician says she can
not safely attend court before the mid
dle of this month. As his Honor Conlan
has Just returned from his midsummer
vacation and as his Honor Mogan will
start within two weeks for a month's
stay in the mountains, the cause of the
transfer of Mrs. Speakman's case is
not difficult to surmise.
It may have been the Joss or it may
have been the defendant's cousins that
restrained Tong Bong from appearing
in Judge Mogan's court to uphold the
complaint of threatening to kill upon
which he had Ham Lung arrested. As
there was no prosecution there could
he no conviction and Ham Lung waa
discharged, with a hint from the bench
that in the long run he would find it
cheaper and more honorable to pay
his rent than to slay Tong Bong.
Tong Bong had already regretted the
publicity which he had given to Ham
Lung's indebtedness through the pla
card, for cousins of the creditor had
visited him and heaped reproach, pro
nouncing his conduct uncelestially pre
cipitate and indirectly impugning the
integrity of the entire Lung family.
"I acted too hastily, oh. Tuck Ling,"
he said to his chief collector, "and sor
row much over what my act has done.
But to preserve my life I must convey
even more unpleasantness to the un
happy Ham Lung and his highly re
spected relatives by having him placed
where he cannot fulfill his threat. After
dcing that I shall confess my great
error to the joss of our tong and pay
due panance."
"To me. oh. Tong Bong," he said,
ycu have brought much disgrace. I
am dishonored in the view of. my coun
trymen, and ere the sun sinks you shall
die."
Ham Lung owed. three months* rental
.of the room occupied by him in China
town, and when he went there Thurs
day evening he saw tacked to the door
a notice which informed him that he
must either vacate the apartment or
pay the landlord. Tong Bong. Angered
by the humiliation thus brought upon
himâ for the notice had doubtless been
read by every occupant of the human
hive that passed the doorâ Lung went
to save his face.
Mrs. Rose McArdle, who Sells gro
ceries and liquors at 540 Sixth street,
told Judge Conlan of how C. J. Howell,
a wild-eyed individual, had endeavored
to. extort $10 from her by representing
himself to be an excise officer and al
leging that her license had expired. He
carried his false pretense so far as to
place her ujider arrest, escort her to
the Central police station and attempt
to book her, but ran away when the
desk sergeant asked him to prove offi
cial authority. The case was contin
ued.
. "It's easy when you know how,"
Frank explained, demonstrating with
flnger and thumb how the button
should be held so' that the needle could
be guided by 6ense of touch into any
desired hole. He further stated that as
he had no home, and could not conven
iently do his tailoring on the street, it
was necessity that drove him Into the
vacant house, as the button which he
was sewing on when arrested bore the
entire responsibility of holding up his
nether garment. He was sentenced to
twenty-four hours In prison to do
whatever further repairing his clothes
might requireâ and they appeared to
need much of it.
. "How could he see to sew without a
light?" Judge Mogan asked the officer,
who passed the query up to the de
fendant.
Frank Morton was seen to enter a
vacant house on Minna street night be
fore last, and when Patrolman McEn
tee investigated he found Frank sew
ing a button on his pantaloons in pitch
darkness.

leges Have Been Adjusted and
Schedule Is Arranged.

was officially announced here to-day
that the Salt Lake Railroad would be
gin running trains into San Bernardino
on Sunday, July 3, and the first train
will pull out of San Bernardino at 6:15

Southern Pacific tracks. This has now
been satisfactorily arranged, the
bridge has been strengthened and all
of the details agreed upon.
. M. M. Potter will be the local agent
for the company,' with offlces in the
Stewart Hotel block, this having been

side, who were in the city to-day for
that purpose. Trains will leave San

where it. has reeei-ved much favorable

the one on exhibition.
despondent brain, thrown back in a
position of abject prostration. With
one hand clenched over his eyes, the
other clutching a portion of the rock,
muscles tense, the figure conveys an
air of desperation, the desperation of
a mental battle against the despond
ency which threatens to undo the man.
At his feet lashes the allegorical Sea of
Despair. The whole subject is one of
extreme intenseness and so we'll has
the sculptor executed -his ideas that
the name of the work or its synonym
readily presents itself to. the observant
critic. The figure not- only bears the
hallmark of a thorough artist, but also
shows a correct familiarity with the
man's anatomical structure.

prominent society and club men of
Minneapolis received probably fatal
injuries and : five other persons were
seriously injured in an . explosion of
a gasoline launch tank in the Eleanor
at Tonka Bay, Lake Minnetonka.

probably fatal; George Upton, prob
ably fatal; Harry Merriman, badly
burned; Mrs. W. P. Devereau, burned
and leg broken; Mrs. H^arry Mer
riman, badly burned; Harry Merriman
Jr., slightly burned; Prudence Merri
man, slightly, burned.
Christian was entertaining a party
of six grown persons and two children
and his boat was headed for the bay
when the explosion occurred. It was
caused by a leak in the gasoline tank
and the boat was wrecked. It Is due
only to the fact that a number of sail
boats and rowboats were in the bay
that the party escaped dedth.
NEW YORK, July 1. â Erysipelas,
resulting from a blow in the face, has
caused the death of Mrs. Christina
Gessman, who was rescued from the
ill-fated steamer General Slocum. The
blow was struck by a fireman, who
rescued the woman from drowning.
Mrs. Gessman jumped from the hur
ricane deck of the Slocum. She was
seen struggling in the water by a fire
man, who leaped to the rescue. He
was caught by the drowning woman,
who choked him with a death grip so
tenacious that finally he was com
pelled to render her unconscious -with
a blow of his first. He then swam
with her to shore. She was hurried to
a hospital, but a slight cut produced
by the fireman's fist developed ery
sipelas and caused the woman's death.
About 25,000 new life preservers are
estimated to have been put in service
on New York excursion boats since
the Slocum disaster. All the manu
facturers are working overtime and
the preservers are being added to the
boat equipment at the rate of 1000 to
1500 a day. The reinspection ordered
by the Federal officials will begin
within a few days.

statement that he is sorry the verdict
was not murder in the first degree,

BERKELEY, July 1.â Without half
trying the people interested in the
West Berkeley- Social Settlement have
already got promises of support, moral
and financial, from many of the friends
of the institution. The campaign has
not been fully launched yet, but whe^
it starts many others are ex
pected to yield to the influences being
brought to bear In behalf of the great
work. Hart Greensfelder, one of the
resident workers at the settlement, is
the leader of the campaign committee
and has received encouragement from
numerous sources. A board of trustees,
numbering among its members some
of the most prominent of the people
of Town and Gown, has been selected,
too, to assist in the perpetuation of the
work.
"It is surprising," Mr. Greensfelder
says, "the number of people interested
in the work. I. find that there is a
unanimous advocacy in its behalf. The
settlement has influenced the whole
West Berkeley district and it has come
to such a pass now that it can
not stop.
"It ought to be an easy matter to
raise $2500 to support the settlement
for a year. We ought not to fold our
arms simply because Mrs. Hearst has
withdrawn her support^ I think we
will be able to show that the friends
are so loyal to the settlement that they
are willing to make some sacrifices and
help us finance it. Perhaps in the fu
ture the burden will not be so heavy."
It will take all ot the $2500 to be
raised to pay for materials used by
the' children of the settlement and the
thousand and one incidental expenses.
Through Mrs. Hearst's generosity many
expenditures will be avoided. She has
relinquished all her interest in the
property of the home, which includes
the lot at Ninth and.Addison streets,
the tennis court,\ gymnasium, printing
room and house furnishings, so that it
will only need the money for actual
running expenses to carry on the
work. â¢

FAMILY REUNION.
Not satisfied with taking all of
Charles Gilmartin's money, three
masked highwaymen last night beat
him Into insensibility in a lonely part
of West Berkeley. The thugs were
evidently displeased with Gilmartin
because he had only 12 in his pockets
and so proceeded to take some satis
faction out of his person.
Gilmartin was set upon late in the
evening while going from his duties
at the West Berkeley Ink Works. The
men jumped out from a dark place in
the street and leveling revolvers at
him compelled-him to give up hi3 (2
in cash. One of the thugs took the
money with an oath and then knocked
Gilmartin down. The man's com
panions followed his example, and
helped to kick and beat their victim.-
Gilmartin came to his senses some
time later and made his way to his
home. His face bears the marks of.
the highwaymen's blows.

In'order to fix the age of the'eave. as
definitely es possible Dr. ; Sinclair has
made comparisons with the fossllerous
deposits at Silver Lake, Or. The Silver
Lake fauna is quaternary, estimated
to be between 1,000,000 and 2,*000,000
years old. and the caye is_ probably of
about the same age. as the proportion
of living to extinct species Is practically
the same. The caye lies on. the crest of
a cpur that Is now 1500 feet above the
Th*.cÂ«ve fauna .is .not too old to negative the
Idea of contemporaneity with man. There can
be little- doubt that if man reached the North
American cenU.ient during the Quaternary It
was by way of the land bridge which then
united Alaska with Siberia at Bering Strait.
Thla land connection permitted the migration
cf many of the mammals now cemmon to the
most nortnern part* of bcth continents It
scemx reasonable to expect that pome of. the
earllett. traces cf man In N'crth America would
|i> found on the Pacific Coaet, where the cli
mate was congenial and food supply abundant
\\ htk- the eactcrn portion of the continent was
nihmeic-.-a beneath the ice sheet. Glaciatlon in
California lias never been general, occurring
o;ly at the higher altitude]-. At its maximum
the coast was almost as well adapted to human
habitation ne it is to-day.
The cave may have been easily accessible to
man. cr may have bern so far from his habita
tion that he would prefer not to visit it fre
quently. A fragment of modern Indian basket
work ws found on the surface near the top,
indicaticLC that the "entrance chambers may
have be*n used occasionally In recent yean
Â¦r a place of rtorage. There wjÂ« nothing to
indtcete they had beÂ«n used In prehistoric
timer II eeems probable that the main cham
ber of the cave once had free communication
with the surface. thaÂ» serving -as a. pitfall to
catch unwary animals. The accumulation of
human remains in such a pitfall would be of
rare occurrence, depending 'â¢ upon accidents
agatnet which the superior Intelligence of man
would protect him.
No trace of human remains was
found in the- cave by the scientists. It
is possible that early man may have
been in existence in the region and his
remains yet have escaped preservation.
On this subject Dr. Sinclair says:
While the explanation of the presence
-of 'xhe' polish may readily apply to the
irregularly shaped objects, Dr. Sinclair
thinks the beveled edges or notcned
bases of others- convey a strong impres
sion of definite purpose -in their fash
ioning. Concluding his opinions on this
subject' he says:
**The writer does not feel justified in
asserting: positively the human origin
of the relics, .believing that we require
stronger evidence than it has yet been
possible to- obtain before such a state
ment can be made." \
Much cf the. material collected in the
cave consists of sharp-edged bone
splinters, which were found at all
depths in the ; bone-bearing deposits.
Of these Dr. Sinclair says that, since
other suggestions fall, to explain them
satisfactorily, it is not beyond the lim
its of possibility that they were made
through the agency of man. The sug
gestion thAt they are the work of man
seems open to the fewest objections.
XO HUMAN REMAINS.
. The'.jwjilshed' bones closely resemble
many -of- the' rough implements from
the shell mounds of California. Dr.
Max Uhle. the archaeologist, believes
that Vh^se implements were originally
splinters accidentally formed in break
ing iix> long -bones. Favorable pieces
were selected because they had sharp
ppints and these wtrr"e\polish.ed for use.
ihe point has often been . bevc.ed by
rubbing On onejside.
To settle, as far as possible, all ques
tion regarding the nature find origin of
these polished bones, every fragment
dis.eover-cd during the excavation of
the cave was preserved. These frag
ments* were a'ftorward submitted to
examination' for traces of polishing and
nptchfes. - Many specimens show dif
ferent .degrees of polish and consider
able variety, of form.- Some of* the
fragments, however, "bear no relation
to any known form of implement, and
.this, suggests the idea that they have
all" been made' in some other way than
through the agency of man, the rough
implement- like form being purely a
ciiance occurrence. .The polish is
thought to be' due to the association
of the bones- with dripping gravel, the
action-' of which gave them gloss and
fcinoothncss. . .
like Korun Implements.
:Â¦ Dr. Sinclair says that much time was
devoted, during the search of the cave
to' -the .quest Â¦ for' human .remains and
.implements; Some of these rude imple
ments'are'pointed et the ends and
fcbmv indications of beveling and pol
ishing.-.Others show distinct notches
'on "ithei'r surfaces, arid still others are
rounded. â¢ . The. considerable depth at
which the specimens were found in un
disturbed earth indicate that they are
jio-t. of recent origin. â¢
; -in pursuing :their researches the sci
entists Vhave preferred to. study the
bones and; fragment*'- exhumed from
the iamous Potter Creek cave, in'Shas
ta-fcunty,. Which has- yielded some
specimens of prehistoric life that' are. of
inestiiriable value â¢ "to. the scientific
world.. ;. The .results of these investiga
tions are ' -sly-en to the piibiic for the
prey rim'e in .a buiretfn issued by the,

"The Exploration. of the Potter Creek
Caye," The -author is Dr. William J.

Auditor Breed has in hand the state
ment of municipal finances for the last
fiscal year. It will show a satisfactory
condition.

population. These figures are based on
an estimated population of 83,00). The
expenses of the Health Department for
1903-'04 were $15,702 85, which is J10S3 25
less thau the preceding fiscal year.

Inspector Bulger Replies to Charge
That Unfit Vessels Have Been
Passed for Service.
The United States inspectors of
steam vessels at this port declare that
great injustice has been done them by
the criticisms of an evening paper,
which, taking the disaster on the
General Slocum at New York as a text,
declares that the local inspectors have
been negligent in passing unseaworthy
vessels as fit for service.
Inspector John K. Bulger, speaking
for himself and Inspector Bolles, said
last evening: ',>>â¢-
It Is charged that at the time of the Klon
dike rush "nearly all the floating coffins of the
world came to the port of San Francisco and
were allowed by the Inspectors of Hulls and
Boilers to ply their nefarious trade to Alaska."
An honest man will not make an accusation
of that eort without backing It with names.
Let tho evening newspaper give us the names
of any unseaworthy vessel that we passed dur
ing either the Klondike or the Philippine rush
Can its editors name any such boat passed by
us? If not, he should withdraw his general
ization.
The facts directly contradict his assertion.
We condemned many vessels. The Professor
Morse, which had been passed by the inspect
ors at New Orleans, was brought round here
for the Alaskan trade, 'but we condemned her
and her bones are now lying over at Oakland.
Not a single accident due to unseaworthiness
occurred on any â¢ vessel passed by us, either
for the Philippine or for the Alaskan trade.
If unfit boats were engaeed in the Alaskan
business, they did not go from this port. We
have no jurisdiction at Seattle I or outside of
San Francisco.
We have steadfastly condemned every boiler
or hull that was unsound, and we challenge
contradiction on this point, not in glittering
generalities, but with names of the unfit ves
sels which it is claimed were- passed by us..

No Agreement With Health Board
Reached Because of Radical
Stand Taken by It.
The Supervisors' Health Committee
met yesterday for the purpose of hear
ing objections to dairymen to the
rules and regulations which the
Board of Health desires to be incor
porated into an ordinance for the san
itary conduct of dairies. The attorney,
for the dairymen said that the confer
ence held with the Board of^Health
was not entirely satisfactory and the
changes proposed were too radical.
He asked that the matter be taken up
again with the Board of Health before
final action by the committee.
M. Pullman did not think it advis
able to have another conference, say
ing that no agreement would ever be
reached on some rules that he termed
unreasonable. For instance, the
Health Board did not want barley
used for cows' food, whereas Pullman
argued experience had taught that
barley was good food. This statement
was corrected, it being the use of sour
barley that was reported against.
Dr. "Ward, president of the Health
Board, refused to consent to another
meeting and presented the findings of
the conference, saying an agreement
had been reached. The dairymen
claimed there was a misunderstanding,
as the recommendations were too
drastic. The recommendations were
taken up seriatim and the objections
of the dairymen were heard. These
related to ventilation, the provision
l[or window space, the double floors
for barns and the 'drainage distance.
The discussion on both sides be
came very lively and Dr. Ward asked
the attorney for the dairymen if he
meant " that the Health ' Board had
been tampering with the rules. The
attorney replied that Dr. Ward could
not put him in that position. Fur
ther hearing of the matter was post
poned until next "Wednesday at 10
a. m.

Trumpet at Fort Point,
j A great improvement, of which all naviga
"j tors of the bay and adjacent waters are loud
la their approval, has Just been installed and
is designated in- the records of the United
States Lighthouse Department as the "Fort
Point Da boll trumpet." The old bell, which
has warned incoming ships of the dangers
concealed in the waters of the Golden Gate
j and has sounded the death knell of many a
, cailant seaman, has been superseded by a
j more effective contrivance. The bell will not
hereafter be heard except in tho clearest
weather and as an auxiliary only.
It has been demonstrated, owing to certain
atmospheric condition;, that the sound of a
' .bell at sea level, especially during the preva-
I lence of fogs, is deceptive and at times diffi
cult to locate, even by the most experienced
Beaman. The presence of bluffs in the vicinity
of Fort Point increases this difficulty, owing
to .the echoes which are Incidental to the lo
cality. No matter how familiar the navigator
j may be with the geography of the bay, there
j are times when to determine the distance or
j direction of the clang of a bell is entirely be
yond his powers.
For this reason the Government has installed
the new apparatus, which emits ' a sound in
short, sharp blasts and will be easily discerni
ble over an area six to eight miles In diam
eter.
The new trumpet, which is of the second
order, is located on the northwest bastion of
the old fort, at the highest elevation, and is
housed In a solid stone structure of substan
j tial construction. The trtimp-t will be oper
l ated by duplicate Hornsby-AUroyd engine?.
I each of five horsepower capacity, with air
I compressors on the same plate. The com
pressed air is forced into steel tanks, from
which it is conducted through pipes to the
i reed box of trumpet and by automatic ar
' rangement released, causing a blast of five
i seconds in duration, three times a minute.
The engines have a capacity of twenty
efsht cubic feÂ«t of air every sixty seconds at
a pressure of seventy-five pounds with 150
revolutions.
The trumpet is of iron, having a length of
three feet and a diameter of ten Inches In Its
widest part.
Colonel Handbury. chief of the United States
Lighthouse Department of the district, expects
the new trumpet to be ready for service in
the coming week.
City Engineer Woodward filed a re
port yesterday with the Board of Pub
lic Works relative to lowering the grade
of Mission street from Cortland ave
nue to Boaworth" street. The reoprt
says that a benefit will result from the
lowering of the grade, but if any
change Is made it should be sufficient
to effect a considerable reduction in the
gradients. The cuts required at the
various intersections would range from
one foot at Sti' Mary's street to seven
teen feet at Highland avenue. Tha side
streets would have to be cut all the way
from one to. eight feet and the prop
erty fronting' thereon would be consid
erably, damaged. The report continues:
Another plan to produce the desired improve
ment would be by means of a new street to tho
west of and parallel with Mission street, which
could be constructed with the proper gradients,
leaving Mission street at its present elevation.
The necessary land could be acquired by pur
chase or under condemnation ' proceedings, and
as the Improvements are not of great value it
would appear that the. expenses would not ex
ceed that of the first proposition. This plan
would, moreover, have the great advantage of
leaving undisturbed all streets to the east of
Mission 6treet. The streets running westerly
from Mission street would be bridged over the
new street.
In this connection it would bÂ« well to con
sider the advisability of raising the grade of
Mlsslcn street from Boeworth street to Silver
avenue. This Is also a most desirable Improve
ment and could be accomplished at . the same
time at comparatively little additional expense
by using the excavated material In making the
fill. C- â¢ \
F. C. Lebenbaum, George O'Brien,
Oscar Mohr and August Hradman of
the*San Francisco Architectural Club
have submitted skÂ«?toln?s for the new
safety station at. the intersection of

Gloom o' nights Is In prospect for the
business streets of San Francisco un
less about 125 -owners of electric signs
secure from the â¢ city certificates of
"satisfactory 'inspection" and pay tha
usual fee therefor. ;
The Novelty Sign Company, which
supplies tha apparatus for the night
display in question, attempted to test
in the Superior Court the validity of
the Supervisors' Â¦ ordinance requiring
inspection of all electrical connections.
The company obtained a temporary
injunction to prevent W. R. Hewitt,
chief of the city's Department of Elec
tricity, from cutting the wires of those
who | had no certificates. In his affi
davit filed In response to the suit Hew
itt said that unless the court restrain
ed him he would give the sign owners
five days' notice to pay up, and failing,
he would cut off their electricity.
Judge Seawell yesterday granted the
city's motion, to dissolve the company's
injunction. The Judge's opinion, which
'will interest the business community,
is here given In full:
An action cannot be maintained solely for
tho' purpose of determining? the question ot
constitutionality ot a statute or municipal
ordinance If a public officer, claiming: to
act under an unconstitutional statute or ordi
nance, should threaten to commit an act
which would cause irreparable injury to an
other, such person would be entitled to an in
junction to prevent the threatened Injury. If
ordinances No. 207 and No. 787 are unconstitu
tional they will afford no Justification for any
Interference on the part 6f defendant with the
electrical appliances which have been Installed
by plaintiff for its customers; and defendant
might be restrained by injunction from inter
fering with any electrical work which plaintiff
was about to do. But such injunction could
properly issue only in reference to some par
ticular work which plaintiff was about to do.
The mere allegation that plaintiff might and
probably would. In the future. Install electrical
appliances would not be a sufficient basis for
such relief. An action, based upon such alle
gation, would be merely an attempt to procure
a decision as to the validity of a municipal
ordinance, without any particular act having
been done or threatened by tive defendant.
The grievance complained of is that defend
ant threatens to disconnect from the wires, by
means of which they are operated, certain
electrical appliances which have been installed
by plaintiff for its customers. Those appliances
are owned wholly by other persons, and plain
tiff has no proprietary interest in them. It
the defendant should, without legal Justifica
tion attempt to commit a trespass upon the
property of other persons, it is a matter of in
difference to plaintiff 'whether thÂ«y will resist
or submit. If they do not resist it will be
because they do not choose to avail themselves
of their undoubted right to defend their prop
erty against unlawful invasion. The theory
upon which plaintiff bases its right to an in
junction Is that the threatened acts, if per
formed, will Injure plaintiffs business, and
deprive it of the patronage of its former cus
tomers. But how can plaintiff be held respon
sible by any reasonable person for illegal acts
of - the defendant â¢Â¦ which he, himself, could
have lawfully presented? v i
In my opinion this action Is merely an at
tempt on the part of plaintiff, without having
any interest in the subject of the action, to
obtain- an, adjudication as to. the validity of a
'municipal ordinance.
. B The Â¦ motion to dissolve the injunction will,
therefore, b* granted.

Captain Hanson of the barkentine W.
H. Dimond, which arrived yesterday, 27
days from Honolulu, reports that June
SO, at ll:Â«0 a. m.. in latitude 37.42 north,
longitude 124.D2 west, he sighted a lot
of wreckage,, and at 8:43 p. m. of the
same day, when about fifty-two miles
due west of the Farallones, the Dimond
passed close to the wreck of a vessel
bottom up. It was too dark for those
on the barkentine to ascertain the iden
tity of the derelict or to form any con
clusion as to her size or rig. She
seemed to be from 150 to 200 feet long
and was apparently wooden. There was
too much sea on to admit of any closer
scrutiny.
The Dimond brought 10,000 bags of
sugar and other cargo. F. M. Rose, W.
J. March and Mrs. W. M. Butler and
child came ud on the barkentino as
passengers.
While rounding to off Black Point at
11:30 o'clock yesterday morning the Di
mond lost her starboard anchor and
sixty fathoms of chain. The vessel had
drifted within 100 yards of Alcatraz be
fore the port anchor held.
There was much speculation yester
day as to the identity of the derelict
reported by Captain Hanson. The de
tails he was able to furnish were so
meager and there are so many vessels
off shore at this time that any surmise
would be mere guesswork. Many local
ship-owners will be anxious until some
thing more is learned of the wreck.

The suave, plausible, diplomatic and flattering stran

invaded our municipal territory again, and, as usual,
several susceptible and unsuspecting women are in the
role of financial victims. Experience certainly is no
teacher in this peculiar field of clever swindling. It
will do no harm, however, to warn women with money
and no established precedents, indicating good common
sense to beware of fascinating strangers.

It is good to laugh. There is prob
ably, snvs Health, not the remotest
corner of the little inlet of the minute
blood vessels of the body that does
not feel some wavelet from the great
convulsion produced by hearty laugh
ter shaking the central man. The
blood moves more rapidly â probably
its chemical, electric or vital condi
tion i3 distinctly modified â it conveys
a different Impression to all the organs
of the body as it visits them on that
particular mystic journey, when the
man is laughing, from what it does
at other times. The time may come
when physicians shall prescribe to 'a
torpid patient, "So many peals of
laughter, to be undergone at such and
such a time."
Laugh and Be Healthy.
O, noble work, heroic, grand.
That saves in scientific ways
Those little lisping lobsters, and .
Keeps them for me and mayonnaise.
And lo. this baby of the sea
In gratitude begins to thrive;
Where one per cent it used to be,
P'ifty. all fat, remain alive.
It takes the tender lobsterlet.
And gives him food and kind advice;
Changes his boots if they are wet.
Brushes his hair and makes him nice.
Art stretches o'er the horrid scene
Her skillful and remedial sway â
And when I speak of "Art" I mean
The Fish Commission. U. S. A.
Nature grim, in remorseless mood.
Undoes thÂ» work that she has done.
And out of every lobster brood
Slays ninety-nine and keeps but one.

emanates from a London newspaper.]

THE Sunday Call magazine to-morrow will contain
many features pertinent to the spirit of the Fourth.
"Patriot's Battle Hymn," a stirring martial anthem
by Eleanor E. Hoeft, set off by a striking poster effect
in red, white and blue, will occupy the front page. "The
July Calendar Girl," a full page half-tone, makes an at
tractive and useful reference page for the month.
"The Fourth of July in Bunnyville," by Jessie Juliet
Knox, illustrated characteristically by Bronstrup, is an
amusing Fourth story which will be enjoyed by the old
as well as by the young. The concluding installment of
"The Fugitive," Ezra S. Brudno's powerful novel, will
appear. On July 10 wiil be published the first install
ment of Miriam Michelson's stor3% "In the Bishop's Car
riage," one of the. very best novels of the day. Amon'j
the -special articles are "New Fads of the New York
Girl," in which among other things, are given some hints
as to' the proper way to give an up-to-date Fourth of
July veranda luncheon; "Hints for Hostesses on the
Glorious Fourth"; "The Evolution of the San Francisco
Yacht," a story that will interest yachtsmen, in view of
the approaching races, and "A Ringing Warning to the
American People," by Bishop Henry C. Potter. This
is the first time that this distinguished divine has ever
expressed himself so fully and so deliberately upon the
vices that are now threatening American civilization.
Madge Moore contributes a. timely page upon "The
Handkerchief Kimona" and Jerome K. Jerome adds to hij
series a sympathetic study of the Hollanders in "The
Little Land of the Happy Dutch."
"The Ruling Passion," by Edwin J. Webster, is the
leading story upon the storiette page, which also con
tains stories by Keith Gordon and John Barton Oxford.
On the Puzzle Page will be found as usual the names of
the winners in the last contest and material for an ad
ditional week's guessing. "The Boy Who Would n
Wizard Be" is a catchy bit of music upon the music
page, which, is in three colors.

A merchant of South Africa has traveled all the way
irom the scene of his commercial activities to this city
to study the character and the habits of the Chinese
in anticipation of their introduction to his far away land
as laborers. Let the visitor take what consolation there
may be in the fact that most of us have been here, as
students of the Chinese coolie longer than he will prob
ably care to stay with us and we are ready to confess
that the men from the East are still enigmas.

The Berlin critics predict an especially
â¢ brilliant career for Miss Eleanor Kess
h^r. a Pennsylvania girl, who has been
engaged for the widely renowned stage
of the Stadt Theater at Luebeck, one
of- the famous "free cities" of the
Fatherland. - r.
. Miss Kessler Is a dramatic soprano
and commands : eleven roles, chief
among them Marguerite In "Faust"
and EJsa in "Lohengrin." She will
make her debut in one of these at Lue
beck in October. This young woman,
whov hails from the little town of
Chambersburg,. Pennsylvania, was ac
corded the- unusual honor of a perma
nent engagement at the Luebeck opera
without the customary trial, or, as it
is called here, "guest engagement." of
six months or more, her voice having
captivated , the .management at first
bearinr.. \ '/
.After a course at the School of In
dustrial Arts in Philadelphia and three
ytars as Eoprario at the West Phila
delphia- Presbyterian Church, Miss
Kessler â¢went to Milan for operatic
study with the celebrated Italian mas
ter.- Â£<empertl, and. for the last two
years' has. pursued her work with Pro
fessor Catenhusen of Berlin, whose tal
ept as a trainer for the operatic stage
Is well known in America, where he
lived for many years. Miss Kessler
acquired what few American singers
have- been able to achieve â a remark
able German diction, which her mas
ters pronounce faultless. She is a tall
brunette oi striking grace of carriage
and. possesses natural dramatic talent.
Fellow countrymen and women who
have watched her preliminary work in
Berlin predict triumphs for her, both
ob the German stage and in her own
country, where- she purposes eventu
ally to. sing and live.
alone had had the good sense to moor
his ships a cable's length apart.
Chang Hi ordered all his horses to be
Jettisoned In order to make room for
several thousand soldiers left high and
dry on the island of Hirado, and did
his very best to try and persuade his
cowardly fellow officers to rally the men,
live on the country and fight their way
Inland. But all to no purpose; the das
tardly generals selected for their own
use the best of Chang Hi's unbroken
ships and at once ignominiously fled
back to China, leaving over 100.000 men
absolutely at the mercy of the Japa
nese.
These poor fellowsâ or such of them
as had escaped the stormâ lost no time
in electing a popular leader of their
own. They set to work cutting down
timber at once, with a view of building
boats for their escape. But in less than
a week the Japanese were upon them in
force, and after being taken from place
to place the 20,000 or 30,000 who escaped
death in the first sanguinary battle
were massacred almost to a man on
Takashima Island. Just outside of
Nagasaki Bay. Only the southerners
were sparedâ for slavery. All the Mon
gols, Koreans and Northern. Chinese
were ruthlessly butchered.
Exactly three men of Fan Wenhu's
100,000 ever reached China to tell the
tale; but Hungtsakiu and Chang HI
seem to have brought safely back via
Korea a good part of the 40,000 . men
who had been at Iki and Masanpho.
Of all the generals Chang Hi was the
only one who escaped punishment at
Cublay's hands.â St. James Gazette.
THANKS are due to the enterprising merchants in
the vicinity of the junction of Market, Stockton,
Ellis and. Fourth streets for constructing at their
own expense ' and presenting- to this city the safety
station at that point. ' .
The suggestion made some time ago to erect a safety
station" at Kearny and Market streets was obviously
a good ' one. yet the feature being new, it required
demonstration to determine its merits. That demon
stration has been made and the innovation has proven
a complete success."' With the rapid growth, of San
Francisco and the consequent congestion of traffic on
; the principal thoroughfares, there is an augmented
danger to pedestrians attempting to cross them or to
â¢ reach the streetcars. It is difficult enough for the
1 young and vigorous to reach a car in" a crowded street,
â¢but for the old and infirm it is often dangerous. Trav
elers on foot have. a right to all possible protection
and teamsters are sometimes careless in recognizing
that right. With the additional factor of the increasing
number of automobiles and the reckless way in which
they are often handled, the danger to persons compelled
to stand waiting in the middle of the street for a car
is made greater.
While. the merchants spoken of have been generous
in providing the safety station, the cost of construction
should not have been upon them, but upon the city.
The greatest good therefrom is to be derived by the
genera) public and not by^the merchants. The cost is
not great comparatively, and the improvement is a per
manent and sightly one and an object lesson to strangers
of the solicitude this city has for the -comfort and wel
fare of its inhabitants.
A consideration of all the facts justifies the-conclu
sion that safety stations should be placed at ail points
Not the Grant Brand.
In the current issue of the Outlook
George Kennan says that Verestchagin
once showed him his painting of the
battlefield of Plevna with the remark
that the original sketch had shown the
hill occupied by the Russian staff all
strewn with champagne bottles. A
Grand Duke who had seen the drawing
insisted that the bottles be painted out,
and the artist had complied. It ' will
be remembered that when some tem
perance people protested to Lincoln
that Grant was a whisky drinker, the
President replied that he wished he
knew the brand so that he, might send
some of the same liquor to his other
generals. But the Russian generals
have not the Grant brand.
Japan Unconquered.
Japan Is the only large country that
has never been conquered.
In the thirteenth century (Professor
E. H. Parker recalls in the Monthly
Review) the â¢Mongol Emperor, Cublay
Khan, -made a bold but ineffectual at
tempt to bring it under subjection.
Toward the invading force the King of
Korea raised 10,000 soldiers, 15,000
seamen, 900 warships and 110,000
cwt. . of grain for the expedition,
and General Hungtsakiu was pro
vided by him with weapons, Korean
<bats of mall (wadded), armor, etc.
In 1281 General Hungtsakiu and his
second In command, Hintu, an Oui
pour Turk, led a total force of 40,000
men "via Kinchou In Korea," which
Professor Parker takes to mean Port
Arthur; and they appear to have

They celebrate New Year's or bring a new dragon
to town with much ceremony and firecrackering. but
they know how to produce the glad popping of powder
without taking life or setting fire to buildings. We do
both and feel that we have had a halcyon and vociferous
time only when we have 'scared^ nervous people into
convulsions, killed a number of small boys, set fire
to ladies' skirts by throwing cannon crackers at their
feet, put out many eyes by powder explosions and
burned a number of buildings on the altar of liberty.
As the movement against the toy pistol is general all
over the country, we will await the statistics of casual
ties with interest to see if it has diminished the slaugh
ter of the day.
The Spanish war was in culmination on the 4th of
July. We were before Santiago, and beset that last
stronghold of the empire of Philip II on our inde
pendence day. But we killed more people celebrating
than were killed on both sides in all that war. We
did it having fun, as some people call it. We should
learn to have fun without giving so much employment
to surgeons, undertakers and grave diggers.
CAREFULLY collected statistics show that we
sacrifice over 4000 lives every year in celebrat
ing the Fourth of July. Most of these are victims
of the toy pistol, an incendiary and infernal machine
for making noise and causing lockjaw. There is a gen
eral movement to outlaw this weapon as a means, of
manifesting patriotic fervor. No doubt it will be
effectually suppressed, but that will not end the slaugh
ter on- the, Fourth.
There are other deadly contrivances, such as cannon
crackers, bombs and other fire vomiting, noise belching
devices called volcanoes and by other names that imply
destruction that will fill the void made by the destruc
tive pistol. The law, hand in hand with common sense,
should follow up the work of abolishing these disturb
ers of. the peace and destroyers of life, until the anni
versary of our independence ceases to be a time of
terror and apprehension and becomes a pleasant, patri
otic day of national enjoyment, as it ought to be.
Americans have run away with the fireworks idea by
degenerating it to the service of mere noise. In this
we imitate the Chinese in all but their conservatism.

THE PATRIOTIC PISTOL.
BilYs Luck.
A number of old-time printers were
gathered about a table in a Third street
resort a few evenings ago. They were
emptying steins and telling stories of
the kind that printers seem to have a
monopoly of. One of the crowd, a
white-headed, bent old fellow, who had
played the part of listener for some
time, finally cleared his throat and
said:
"You all remember old Bill Johns,
who died here a few years ago. He was
a good man in his day. was Bill, and
until he let drtnk get the best of him
was one of the best 'prints' on the
coast. The story of his downfall,
though a sad one. has its humorous
side. It happened in this wise.
"Bill was a lottery fiend. He would
buy from ?10 to $40 worth of tickets
every month. He never won even an
approximation prize, but always 'be
lieved that some day he would win a
capital. We were working together on
a morning paper at the time, and one
morning Bill, as was his custom, hung
about the galley boy until a proof of
Fifteen tons of leaflets, pamphlets and books, descrip
tive of the. agricultural and horticultural wonders oi
California, have been sent by the State Board of Trade
to the St. Louis Exposition, and it is a safe wager that
even after this mass of material has been digested by
an intelligent public not one- half the truth has been
told of. the good things of the Golden State. Were
it not for the admonitory finger of modesty, we could
say more.
The Audubon Society should address its energies in
this practical channel. All imported leathers and plum
age, except of the goose and ostricn, can be shut out
by a single paragraph in the tariff putting on a pro
hibitory duty. As for our domestic birds, dealing in
their feathers can be outlawed by the law of every
State. It is a mistake to suppose that the ladies are
responsible for this traffic, and therefore .are cold
hearted and cruel. They buy what the millinery market
supplies, and finding plumage on sale, take it as they
do silks and ribbons. Let the law forbid it the market
and the ladies will not take their shotguns and go
afield to supply themselves.
Getting away from the special creation idea, to ac
count for the origin of species, and viewing the whole
vast scheme as the issue of nature's great law of
equilibrium, the practical argument for reasonable
preservation of birds has greater force than this senti
mental plea. It is told of a sentimental father that he
called his little son's attention to the wisdom of God
in the creation of the crane. Its long legs fitting it
for wading in the water, and its slim toes pointed so as
to be put noiselessly into the water, and its long neck
and bill so adapted to dart into the water and seize
the fish which it had approached by stealth, were all
evidences of the divine care for the crane. But the
more practical little boy said, "Yes, but isn't it hard on
the fish?"
Nature makes provision for an equilibrium. All living
things prey on living things, animate or inanimate. It
is the law of life. If birds so multiply that their insect
or other food fail the equilibrium is destroyed and birds
perish. Then the insects come again and so multiply
that they invade the food supply of creatures higher in
the scale. In the great plan man is apt to get more
than his share, but if he does he suffers from lost
equilibrium. As a practical proposition it is uneconomic
for man to take a single tooth or claw out of the great
predatory scheme for the purposes of mere vanity.
When taking them is made necessary to preserve the
natural balance, it is according to economic principles
to make such profitable use of the prey as may appear.
Our fish and game laws and our statutes protective
of birds are founded, not upon sentiment, but upon
practical economics. Many of the plumage birds are
not native to this country. Their slaughter will never
be stopped by sentimental appeals. When the law
makes their plumage contraband of commerce, as it
may, the temptation to hunt is taken away by destroy
ing its profit, and the "birds of plumage bright" will
be as safe as the uninteresting mud turtle or the squat
and warty toad.
OFFICERS of the Audubon Society are making
an energetic attempt to stop the slaughter of
plumage birds to furnish feathers for the hats
of ladies. We desire to enlist in this praiseworthy
work, as far as a newspaper may aid it. We think,
however, that the merely "sentimental side of the matter
ir depended on too much. The argument made is that
the birds and all living things are our fellow creatures,
and that the common Creator of all is dishonored; when
man, the head of- creation, preys upon birds for com
mercial purposes.
Following this sentimental line it is pointed out that
the birds are useful to man by -preying upon insects
that do him harm by consuming for their food that
which he requires for his. Therefore, he should use
the birds as his instruments in destroying still lower
forms of life, in order that he may appropriate to his
own use that which those lower forms require for theirs.
In this view the birds are sent by the Creator to be
the feathered friends of man and to destroy lesser lives
that issue from the same creative source.
This argument defeats itself. How can finite man
determine that one form of life is less sacred than
another in the eye of a common creator? If the bird
is elevated to an equality of right of possession of the
earth with man, what revelation of the creative pur
pose denies that same right of equality to the least
living thing? If "the smallest insect stepped upon feels
as great a pain as when a giant dies," what right has a
predatory bird to pursue the said insect, seize it, swal
low it and send it to be ground between the gravel
stones in its gizzard?
Cublny's first disillusionment took
place when his miserable generals,
with their tails between their legs,
came whimpering back to China. It
appears that the Korean force, whose
headquarters had bpen (like those of
General Kuropatkin now) at Liaoyang,
and which had coasted safely down to
Iki, was summoned to Join Fan Wen
hu's grand army at Hirado. Here the
"divided counsels" which Cublay so
much dreaded unfortunately itook
place.
Instead of boldly marching together
upon Dazaifu, the rival generals be
gan bickering and squabbling, until on
the first day of the eighth month (Sep
tember) a fearful typhoon suddenly
arose and broke up most of the fleet
lying- there at anchor. The only ships
not smashed to pieces were those of u
Chinese captain named Chang Hi, who

his generals had impressed upon them
the tiselessness of massacring the
population of a conquered country;

most uneasy is the fear of distracted
counsels. Whatever you do. hold to

Ehman, who is a laborer about 39
years of age, was walking to San Fran

There is a double track at the point
where the man was struck, and in
stepping from the track to avoid a
northbound train he walked directly in
front of one going the opposite direc

but it was too late. Ehman was hurled
fifty feet into the air and fell to the
ground. The train was stopped and
the crew expected to pick up a dead
man. Ehman was found sitting on the
side of the road looking around for his
hat. He was offered a ride into the
city and medicai aid by the railroad
physician. He declined and said that
he would be all right In a short time.
Later the police received a telephone
message that the man was near the
woolen mills and could not walk. The
patrol wagon was sent after him and
he was brought to the receiving hospi
tal. Dr. Grissim, the railroad physi

As naked as truth, J. L. Smith
started to promenade Kearny street
yesterday morning.
In these artificial days when South
Sea Islanders bow to the proprieties
to the extent of palm leaves^ â and when
even summer bathing girls wear some
thingâSmith's retrogression In dress
reform caused something of a sensa
tion.
Casting off his clothing, he emerged
from his lodgings at 523 Kearny street
and ambled up the street. There we're
those who believed a ghost had walked,
and an unmarried elderly lady shrieked
and swallowed a set of teeth.
"He did not even have a necktie on,"
she said.
. Lightly as a wood nymph, though
terrifying as a Satyr, and as care free
as old Adam, Smith trotted along the
sidewalk. The crowd parted for him,
and women, after the first terrified
glance, seemed Intensely Interested In
the distant horizon.
A laborer on his way to work held out
a bandana handkerchief to the man
who had gone back to nature with a
rush. "For decency's sake wear some
thing," pleaded the son of toil.
Scornfully the naked man waved
aside the gift. "Let me alone," he
shouted, "I'm God."
A hand-me-down vendor of garments
saw a possible customer and clutched
at the maniac. "Step right in, sir,"
said the clothier; you out In ten
minutes from tip to toe. Show you
some fine garments, sir; step right In."
By a herculean effort the naked man
tore himself away from the shark and
burst into a saloon at Pine and Kearny
streets. With great presence of mind
the bartender quickly knocked the head
from a beer barrel and passed it over
to Smith. "Wear this." entreated the
bartender. But the garment did not
appeal to Smith's fastidious tastes.
Corporal O'Meara, who alighted from
a passing car, rushed into the saloon
and cast a table cloth over Smith's
body. Garbed in this improvised togra
Smith was taken to the City Prison.
He has been mentally unbalanced for
some time and was considered a harm
less religious crank.

The Board of Health yesterday sent
notices to the various medical col

County Hospital. This is due to the
fact that the limit of patients has been
fixed at 425, owing to the insufficiency
of the appropriation to care for a
larger number. All applicants must

Madame Cecile Dolon's effort to ob
tain a life interest in the home she
has been occupying at 127 Oliveavenue
from W. H. Chickering:, the Oakland
attorney, has come to naught. Superior
Judge Seawell yesterday rendered a
written opinion in the case, with judg
ment in favor of Chlckerlng. (
The suit was brought by Mrs. Dolon
to re-form a deed dated September 8,
1894, by which she conveyed to Chick
ering certain property on Ellis street
and Olive avenue. She alleged that
for many years Chickering had been
her attorney and confidential adviser
and she became indebted to him in the
sum of $1500. While, so indebted it
was. agreed between them, she said,
that she should convey to him the
land; that he should pay a mortgage
for $6000 standing on the property
and pay her in cash $1000 and that
there should be reserved in the deed a
life estate in a portion of the lot.
Chickering prepared the deed, which
contained no reservation to the plain
tiff of the life estate. Mrs. Dolon de
clared she could not read and did not
know of the omission.
Mrs. Dolon's testimony was con
tradicted by Chickering, who admit
ted, however, that he told her she
might occupy a part of the property
so long as he was owner of it.
The action was brought to re-form
the deed by Inserting the reservation.
The court holds that the testimony of
the plaintiff at the trial as well as the
letter given In evidence showed con
clusively that she did not intend there
should be any express mention of the
life estate In the deed, but that she
trusted Chickering without any writ
ing to carry out their agreement.
Judge Seawell says further that Chick
ering paid the full value of the prop
erty.
Judge Scawell Finds That Oakland
Attorney Did Xot Violate Agree
ment With the Woman.

evening to Army Point, proceeding to

â¢Vallejo, where anchors will be dropped
for. the night. On Monday the yachts
av:11 race down from Vallejo to Tiburon
or some point near Belvedere cove, each
iboaf receiving' an arbitrary handicap.
I'his'is the first attempt of the Corin
thians to hold a race from Vallejo to
"iiburqn 'and it is no easy task for the
'Â¦regatta committee to assign proper
handicaps. The tide on Monday is not
suitable "for such an event, as it be
gins to flood at S:33 a. m. at Fort Point,
rendering an early start from Vallejo
necessary so as to get well down the
ba'y v/ith the ebb tide.

Club "will cruise this evening to San

in the formal challenge for the Per

Corinthian was given as 29.91 feet.
Should the boat, on being measured,
prove to have a smaller racing length,
6he will still have to race at 29.91 feet,
whereas, is she turns out to have a
greater racing length, she will have to
give a corresponding time allowance to
the San Francisco boat. The official
measurement of the two yachts will be
made next Tuesday at Stone's yard, in
Tiburon cove, or other convenient spot,
by George Harrold, measurer of the
Corinthian Yacht Club, and W. W. Far

The race will be in charge of the re

conveyed over the course on the steam

Los Angeles has announced a harness
meeting for November. A new associa
tion has been organized and a first
class programme is to be given soon. '
The Pacific Coast" Trotting Horse
Breeders' 'Association at Its annual
meeting, held last. week, elected the fol
lowing new board of directors:. E.'P.
Heald, president; J. C. Kirkpatrick,
first vice . president; F. H. Burke, ; sec
ond vice president; A. B. Spreckels, T.
J. Crowley,.I. L. Borden, C. A. Durfee,
A. ' J. Molera, James Coffin, George W.

tain N. T. Smith was elected treasurer
and ,F. W. Kelly, secretary.; The-asso
ciation 'is -in' a flourishing condition.
The great trainer Budd Doble may be
seen in the sulky during the breeders'
meeting at San Jose: He is not train
ing a, string of horses for the circuit,
but he will be asked to show his great
trotter. Kinney Lou, 2:07%, one day of

Everything seems favorable for a
short "but brilliant season of harness
racing this year in California. The
circuit will open at Pleasanton on the
27th. Nearly 200 horses have been
namedi in the different trotting and
pacing events that make up a four
days' programme. The week follow
ing this meeting at Pleasanton the
horses will be at the San Jose track
for four days, where the annual meet
ing of the Breeders' Association is to
be held and the rich $6000 Futurity
will be decided. Thence they wilJ
move to Vallejo for a meeting, of the
same duration; thence to Santa Rosa,
where they will close a four days'
meeting on Saturday, August 20, and
be ready to move the next day to Sac
ramento, where the State Fair will open
a two-^weeks' meeting with" the Occi
dent stake for three-year-old trotters.
This will be worth more than $3000 this
year.
More than $60,000 in purses and
stakes will be decided before this
short circuit is over. From Sacra
mento many of the leading stables
will go north, to compete for some
large stakes given by the Oregon State
Fair at Salem.
Great interest centers In the 2:24
class trotting events for which the
breeders and the State Fair have hung
up $2000, the Santa Rosa meeting
$1500,' Pleasanton $1000 and Vallejo
$1000. The high class mare Sonoma
Girl is. entered in the majority of
these events, but negotiations are on
for her Bale to an Eastern party for a
large sum. If sold she will be im
mediately shipped East and will not
compete on the coast tracks this year.
This will leave the race an open one
in which the winner will be hard for
even the wise ones to pick. Among
those entered in these trots are Mar
tin Carter's chestnut stallion, T C, by
Nutwood -Wilkes, j which has trotted
a quarter in 32 seconds; a Santa Rosa
horse called R W P, now in J. W.
Zibbell's ! string and spoken of as a
coming wonder; | H. C. Ahler's Tele
pone, by Direct; which has worked a
mile .in 2:13; Robert Burress' . Golden
Gate, -by Bay Bird, which has beaten
2:15 three times In a workout at Pleas
anton, and a horse from Eureka called
Morosco, which can! show a 2:10 gait.
If , one horse proves ' good enough to
win allthe races of this class on the
circuit he will earn about. $5000.
There are many flyers among the
green pacers also and 2:10 will proba
bly be beaten the first time they get
the word. : Billy Red, a bay , gelding
owned by J. D. Springer of Pleasanton,
stepped-the last half of that track in
1:01 several weeks ago. He will be
a sure starter at Pleasanton, barring
accidents. : . â¢ \
Next Saturday there will be a Scotch
foursome over eighteen holes, medal
play, for men. Partners will be as
signed and their handicaps will then
be allotted. Prizes for this event have
been offered by C. A. Belden.

morning. It is open to members of any
golf club. The trophy must be won
twice by the same player before be

1901, by Mrs. R. Gilman Brown; the
fourth, in 1902, by Miss Ruth Under
hill; the fifth, in 1903, by Miss Florence

J. R. Kei!niff and a party of friends
will leave for the Country Club on the
Truckee next Friday. Will Foulks se
cured fifteen trout on a fly on Thursday
evening in the Truckee.
A. B. Finch leaves to-day for his an
nual pilgrimage to Big Meadows.
"Mr. and Mrs. George Salmon and
Miss- Mabel Nace have returned from
Boulder Creek, where they caught a
large number of trout.
Many fishermen will spend the.holi
days at Santa Cruz, where there is a
good run of salmon.
Jabez Swan left yesterday for a short
stay on the Russian River. He will
try for both trout and bass.
Adolph Roos is enjoying the excellent
fishing at Tallac, on Lake Tahoe. Many
anglers are at the lake.
Achille Roos leaves for Webber Lake
on Tuesday. W. C. Murdock, A. Lan
german, Ed Schultz and Jim Maynard
have returned from Webber. The fly
fishing had just commenced when they
left. The trout are taking the black
gnat, March brown and the Langerman
blue-bottle.
In addition to trout the fishermen
may take black bass, as the season
opened yesterday. The Russian River
is a favorite haunt of- these fish, which
are considered a gamer fighter than the
trout.
The Independence day holidays will
be stirring times for the trout in all the
coast and mountain streams. Men and
maids, skilled and unskilled in the
subtle art of the angler, will be abroad
in the land in countless thousands. The
city sportsmen will be equipped with
split bamboo rods and the finest of
tackle. The country boys with home
made rods and primitive tackle will be
on hand to help (for a slight considera
tion) the unsuccessful city anglers re
turn in triumph from the streams with
well-laden creels.
The streams throughout the State are
yielding good returns and the season
promises to be one of the best the
anglers have ever enjoyed.

FIFTEEN STRAIGHT GAMES
WON BY NEW YORK TEAM
PORTLAND, July 1.â For the fourth
consecutive game Uncle Henry Harris
saw his men beaten to-day by the
Browna. The score was not largeâ 5 to
3â in spite of the large total of hits.
Yerkes was hit rather -more freely than
was Iberg, though the one-time San
Franciscan was touched up pretty live
ly. The Browns scored two runs in the
first inning. Then in the fourth the
home team' added another to the score.
In the sixth Ban Francisco got busy
and tallied two, and' in the next Inning
tied the score. Yerkes gave Nadeau a
base on balls In Portland's half of the
seventh. McCreedie hit safely for one
bag, and chased Nadeau home on a
double made by Drennan. No more
runs were scored and the game went
to the home team. The score:

CHICAGO, July 1.â The Grand
Jury voted indictments to-day against
forty-two persons alleged to have been
taking wagers at the Hawthorne race
track. As a result of this action Sher
iff Barrett, who has refused to pro
ceed against the bookmakers unless
warrants were issued for their arrest,
will be compelled to serve the writs
and to take the accused persons into
custody or compel them to furnish
bonds for their appearance in the
criminal court.
The bills voted against the book
makers are under a section of the law
which has hitherto been ignored in
the prosecution of race track gam
bling in Chicago. In the past indict
ments have always alleged that the
accused-- persons were inmates of a
gambling-house. Convictions under
that section have been impossible, so
to-day's indictments charge the book
makers with keeping gambling ap
paratus.
Among those who were indicted are
such well known bookmakers as Fred
Cock, Sam Summerfleld. Steve l'Hom
medieu, Marcus A. Cartwright, Wil
liam Appleg-ate and John Cella.

MORE TROUBLE
FOR PENCILERS
The matches to-day should all be
close and interesting, as the poorer
players have been weeded out.
Only four players entered the wom
en's tournament. One match was
played. In it Miss Hazel Hotchkiss
easily beat Miss Berry. The score was
6â2, 6âL In the other preliminary
match Miss Jones will meet Miss Wege
ner. This match will be played this
morning. The finals are set for the
afternoon.
Following is , the tournament by
rounds:
Preliminary round â Guerin beat Hotchkisa
by default; Brabant beat Mann by default;
Griffin b*at Caesell. 6-0, 6-0 (withdrew): Long

MacGavin and Baker, the strongest
two players in the tournament, were in
good form. Baker was a trifle off in his
first match, but played his best game
against Janes. The latter failed to get
a game in the first two sets. MacGavin
figured in two easy matches and did
not have to extend himself.
By far the best match of the day was
that between Herbert Long of the Cali
fornia Club and Charles Foley of the
Golden Gate Club. These two clever
youngsters played like veterans and
started the spectators cheering. After
losing the first set Long won the next
three cleverly. In the first set Foley
was invincible and volleyed Long's ter
rific drives to all corners of the court.
Long 'was able, to win but one game in
this set. In the second set Long im
proved and won handily. The third set
was by far the most exciting of the
four. Foley led at 5-3 and 40-0, but
Long fought desperately and pulled it
out. In the fourth set both players
were badly used up from the heat and
slackened their pace noticeably. Long
ran the score up to 4-1, but Foley won
four straight games. Both fought hard
at the finish. Victory went to Long by
a small margin.

TWO OF THE ilOST st'CCESSFUL OF THE COMPETITOR? OX THE HOTEL RA- ,
FAEL TENNIS COURTS AT SAN RAFAEL YESTERDAY IN THE OPENING
.ROUND OF THE ANNUAL CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNAMENT
. JfEW LONDON', Conn., July 1.â Yale
Â»6n the annual varsity eight-oared
: racÂ« from'Hafvard to-day and crowned
â¢arjesr that h'as been replete with bril

_ proved, as' she has done many times

V.Her Victory >n the varsity race, con
sidered with her grand battle in the
â¢four-oared race, which she lost through
-an. accident when it looked like a walk
over, and the winning .of her freshmen
â¢Â£ight Â¦ yesterday in a "magnificent
'strjiggle,. makes it fair to say that Yale
; outclassed Harvard.
The water was so choppy to-day that
. both varsity crews dropped their stroke
Mow again and again on account of the
heavy swells, which made a high stroke
' impossible. For this reason the race
Â¦vyas unique. It has never before hap
pened that two varsity eights have
. raised and lowered their stroke to such
Â¦an .extent as these two crews did in
.tf"day's race. Both ranged from 25 to
â¢C6 to. the minute. Yale'6 normal stroke
Vas 32, while Harvard's was from 33
"to' 24; ...
'..In, the opinion of the experts Yale's
. victory is due to her longer stroke and
Â¦the fact that she used the powerful
â¢body swing and the leg .drive simul
â¢ taneously, while Harvard used up her
l^g drive power too quickly. So far
. fes watermanship was concerned and
the harmony of the oars, there was no
,' choice between- them.
Â¦Â¦ : Upori the return of the Yale eight
t's their quarters,* where they were ac
corded an enthusiastic reception, the
. oarsmen elected as captain for next
" year Richard Whittier of Staten Is
lar.d. N. Y., who revved at No. 6 in to
day's race. Later O. D. Filley of Paris,
France, stroke of this year's crew, was
elected captain of the Harvard' var
sity eight.
Throughout the race the Elis were
never headed and from the crack of
the pistol the result was never in
tioubt- It was a case of superiority in
rowing strength and rowing funda
mentals. Within a quarter of a mile
from the start Yale had established
"herself in a comfortable position a
kmgth ahead. This had been accom
plished in *r>ite of the fact that Har
. var<3 rowed fully two more strokes to
Â« he minute than Yale.
The Xew Haven oarsmen increased
their lead steadily until two and one
half miles had been traveled. Then
' their shell suffered from the eel grass
fcectlan of the course. Harvard pulled
up one length, but when the Yale shell
reached clear water again the superior
ity of the blue became more than evi
denL Gradually the contest became a
profession and Yale's victory was as
decisive as the most ardent of her sup
porters could wish.
Just before the big race Harvard had
snatched an eleventh-hour victory in
the four-oared race. In this event;
which was rowed upstream from the
navy yard to Gales Ferry Yale had led
throughout and within a quarter of a
mjle of the finish was rowing well and
two lengths ahead. At this point the
Yale men seemed to go to pieces. It
was not a collapse of oarsmen, how
ever. There was an unfortunate weak
ness in Yale's rigging and the outrig
ger Fish was pulling broke. This pre
cluded all possibility of a Yale victory.
Harvard, astern, saw her chance,
epurted, and won a victory which was
confessedly hollow.

three events which now constitute the

SHEEPSHEAD BAY. July 1.â Apart
from the sensations afforded by falls
in the Interstate Hunters' steeplechase
at the Coney Island- Jockey Club's
course to-day, the Incidents connected
with the handicap at one mile and three
furlongs gave ample cause for com
ment.
After tho 50 to 1 shot Male Harilon
had made the running for nine : fur
longs and the small field had strung
out for at least 100 yards, the -heavily
weighted .'three-year-old. Graaialla,
which had been running second, made
his bid for the race. He came around
the fast-tiring leader, and in so doing,
it is asserted, he fouled - her and
knocked her back. "â¢ At the same in-
Btant Hiltiebrand, the rider of Brigand,
saw an opening near the Tail and shot
his horse through there. About a fur
long from the finish Brigand reached
out arid seized Grazlallo's jaw." In doing
this Brigand's head and body were in
clined diagonally toward . the outside,
so that he actually impeded Graziallo.
Jack Martin was forced to pull the lat
ter away, and this lost him his ehance
of passing the judges first. Brigand
beat him to the finish by three parts
of a length.! Martin and Hildebrand
were summoned before the judges, and
within a few moments the numbers
were changed. To the surprise of near
ly all the spectators Brigand's number
remained up, 'while Graziallo's was
taken down. It was held that he had
really destroyed Male Hanlon'a
chances. Summary:

The trouble grows out of the Mary
Duran case, which was to be tried on
July 6 by Judge Cook. When Attor
neys Riordan and McXab had the case
transferred to Judge Troutt's depart
ment on Thursday Collins protested
that the transfer was "irregular." He
remonstrated orally, then filed a dis
missal, in which he spoke of "condi
tions that operate to prevent an order
ly administration of the law."
Hutton charges that Collins has been
guilty of grave offense in these words,
and of contempt shown the superior
courts of this city.
Collins threatens In turn to make
charges against the Police Commis
eioners that will make the Mayor
"take notice." He will try to have the
official declared unfit for his position.
He also denies that he reflected on
the court, saying he merely exposed
methods of Hutton's which, he says,
were irregular. Collins says he hopes
proceedings against him will be pushed
without delay, that he may vindicate
himself and expose his enemies in liti
gation.
Police Commissioner H. W. Hutton
has asked that Attorney George D.
Collins be disbarred for filing in Judge
Graham's court a dismissal that re
flects, according to Hutton, on the
court.

SAN JOSE, July 1. â A man giving
the name of John Murray is wanted by
the police for victimizing: F. H. Sprung,
a blacksmith on Market street, out of
$32 50. The fellow had called at the
shop of Sprung & Schmltt and asked
for work and he was engaged for the
afternoon. About quitting time he
asked to be excused for a few minutes
as he was to meet John Combs, a
rancher living near Cupertino, and
secure a month's wages that was com
ing to him.
Murray returned In a few minutes
with a check on the First National
Bank, bearing what was purported to
be Combs' signature, for $32 50. When
Sprung paid the man for his after
noon's work he asked Sprung to cash
the check, as he was going away.
Sprung did not have the money handy
and he took the man to the Eagle
Brewery, where the check was cashed,
Sprung guaranteeing it. Yesterday
the check was returned from the bank,
where it had been pronounced a for
gery. Sprung knew Combs and be
lieved the check was good. Murray is
a young man about 32. years of age
and police are now trying to locate
him.

Ying's remains will be burled to-day
with all the honors due to a Chinese
funeral. The steamship company will
send a handsome floral piece as a
memento of their regard for a faithful
servant.
On the top floor of a building at
71S Commercial street last night lay
the dead body of George Louey Ying,
who for sixteen years held the position
of Chinese agent for the Occidental
and Oriental Steamship Company.
Dressed in a beautiful suit the corpse
reposed on a rude Chinese bed, around
which burned candles and nut oil
lamps. Kneeling in anguish over the
loss of a dear father and husband
were five little Celestials and the sor
rowing wife.
Ying died yesterday after a pro
longed illness. When taken sick a
month ago he was removed to the
Southern Pacific Hospital by the offi
cials of the Occidental and Oriental
Company, who held him in great re
gard. For a month Ying sank. Yes
terday he knew his end was near, and
fearing to die in the great hospital
away from his wife and children, he
arose, weak as he was, and went home,
much against the protests of the hos
pital people. â¢
Slowly he climbed the long stairs
that led to the abode where he had
lived for seventeen years. He reached
the apartments of his family, kissed
his wife and fondly clasped the little
almond-eyed darlings in his arms and
then sank into the death sleep.
All last night his remains were
carefully guarded, and Oriental viands
were placed before his bier. The
scene was pathetic. The Chinese,
ordinarily so devoid of feeling:, came
in, looked sorrowfully at the parted
friend, and left their offerings before
the coffin. Ying had many friends
and was respected by all.

LITTLE FALLS, Minn.. July. 1.â
Several days ago Frank . Weiner. a
farmer well advanced in years, was
clubbed to death in his bedroom, and
his bride of three months was held on
suspicion. She is about 16 years old.
To-day she made a confession to the
effect that John Kardasch, 17 years old
and her lover, had committed the
brutal crime. The officers sent to ax
rest the lad found him on . Weiner'B
farm, where he was digging a grave
for the dead man.
The girl widow declares that she and
the boy planned to dispose of the aged
husband and then get married. The
crime was planned in advance, she
said, and Kardasch came to the farm
house at midnight, entered the bedroom
occupied by Weiner and his wife and
knocked the old man into insensibility.
Then he battered his head and body
until life was extinct.
Two cluljg spattered with blood were
found on the floor of the room. One
was very heavy and thick; the other
was a lighter but a more formidable
weapon. This fact is cited in support
of the theory that Mrs. Weiner has not
told the whole truth. Lorenzo Kardasch,
father of the lad, accused the girl of
the crime.
Mrs. "Weiner and Kardasch are held
In the County Jail.

The , provision market was strong under the
Influence of an active demand Â¦ from shorts

responsible for the Improved : demand "At the

CHICAGO, July 1. â Antagonistic opinion* as
to the damage Inflicted by rain tn the South
west held wheat traders In check to-day.
Closing "prices were practically Identical with
yesterday's final figures. Corn Is up 'ic. Oats
show a loss of }Ac. Provisions aro 10@i'2^c
higher. â¢
At the start a steady tone prevailed in
whtat. as the result or firm cables and bullish
news from the Southwest. September was un
changed to a thade higher at Sli' t Â©Sl%c. For
a time the buying of July was of an urgent
character, shorts being the principal pur
chasers. A total absence of deliveries on July
contracts was the main incentive to buying.
Th^ demand for distant futures was much
better than the supply, resulting in quite a
firm undertone. After Seritamber had touched
Sl'/ie a weakening of the market carried the
price down to SO*Â«(g^lc. TherJ was quite
liberal selling by traders who wished to even
up trades over tho holidays. Considerable
wheat aleo came out on reports of a pros
pective large movement In the Southwest. 75
cars being estimated for Tuesday at St. t^uls
and* 150 cars at Kansas City. Later a revis
ion of the figures making the movement much
lighter caused a rally. Advices from the South
west regarding the condition of the crop were
conflicting, but to a large extent Impression
prevailed in the later. trading that the Kansas
crop will be materially reduced, and if the
rains continue the quality will be poor. Shorts
wsrt good buyers later In the day and a mod
erately firm tone prevailed at the close. Final
flgureu â¢ on September were Â¦ at 81U@81>-ic, a
net loss of }6c for the day.

Receipts of new Potatoes from the river dis
tricts were the heaviest for some little whil*
back and too much for the regular trade to
absorb, and. as there was no Inquiry from
outside points, prices receded and the market
closed weak, with quite a quantity unsold. One
small lot "f selected whites sold at $2 35 per
cental, but for the general market the top
quotation was an extreme figure. Yellow
Onions were slightly lower owing to the lack
of demand for shipping. whil^Red were steady
at the previously quoted rates. - _-
Price* of Summer Squash and Cucumbers
continued to decline under increased receipts
and small packages of both descriptions were
almost unsalable. Tomatoes ruled firm under
a steady call for local use. and a carload of

NEW YORK. July 1. â Some excited specu
lation In the Metropolitan traction stocks was
the feature of to-day's market, and saved it
from the lethargic condition expected on the
eve of a three days' holiday. Other New York
stocks ehowed ume sympathy, as they always
do with one another. Prices ruled generally
above last night, but the fluctuations in some
of the market leaders were not above %. The
time money market was called slightly firmer,
but this was* largely a sentimental effect on a
slightly Increased demand for money In con
nection with the July disbursements. Call
money railed to get above H4 PÂ«" cent during
the day. Union Pacific and Southern Pacific
scarcely stirred on reports of May net earn
ings which were- regarded as favorable. The
reaction In the New York stocks In the last
hour affected the general tone and the clos
ing was easy. Total sales of bonds, par value,
$1,720,000.
A combination of circumstances has made
this week one of the dullest In the stock mar
ket for many years past. The most obvious
cause for this was the decision of the Stock
Exchange authorities to clon* the exchange on
Saturday as well as on Monday. July 4. An
other special factor In the current small deal
ings is the crusade by the exchange authorities
to prevent arbitrage operations between the
board room and outside markets. This is an
operation for making the profit of a differ
ence in simultaneous prices in two markets
by selling In one ax.d buying In the other. Only
the most dlnct communication between the
two markets makes It feasible, and such com
munication Infringes laws of the 'Stock Ex
change. The summary removal of telephone
communication of a number of firms from the
floor of the Stcck Exchang:- served cs an ad
monition to the whole membership to refrain
from this kind ef trading. Stress has been laid
also on the political outlook In an undeter
minate condition, the Government's report of
crop conditions and the extreme conservatism
existing in all business and enterprises., and
which Is accurately reflected in the stock mar
ket. There have been no really Important de
\-elopments durinc the week toward solving
the uncertainties and efforts to stimulate
activity in stocks have been futile. The week's
advices on the crocs were mixed and baffled
the f-fforts of operators In stocks to malce any
consistent interpretation of them.
A general eense of eontentmtnt over condi
tions may be inferred from the Â«ibÂ«'nce of
pregruxe to liquidate in the market. Showings
of railroad earnings are mixed, but the aver
age of erosE earnings for .IunÂ» Is eomewhat
better than last year, and traffic officials
have expresed hopes for future husinesi Â¦ with
rather greater confidence. The reports of net
earnings for May. however, have made poor
comparison* with the previous year, and re
trenchment In opera tljÂ« expenses is counted
a vital necessity for trftrovin*- the net return.
Such retrenchment has continued at various
points, report* pointing especially to cutting
down the worklns fores on the Pennsylvania
eyftero.
The broad demand for bonds has movec
many long dormant 'Issues, but these usually
Inactive bonds have been only moderately

" -The Business Man's Delight,'
For a few minutes yesterday morn
ing the Custom-house clerks and bro
kers on the main floor were thrown
into a tumult by the desperate at
tempt of George Wilde Branch, a
clerk in the naval office, to commit
suicide by stabbing himself in the
throat with a steel eraser. Branch
was demented as a consequence of a
nervous breakdown, which had been
in progress for the last three years.
The life of the demented man was
saved by the prompt interference of
Clerk Daniel Gorham, who seized
Branch and disarmed him. The
wounds are two, and neither touched
an artery. Branch was sent to a san
itarium.
In the drawer of his desk were
found a razor, a loaded revolver and
a Japanese dagger, and It had evi
dently been the clerk's intention to
use one or more of these weapons
upon himself or some imaginary en
emy.
Branch's wife died several years
ago and he took to drink. He was
then afflicted with dropsy and weak
heart and until within a few months
ago had been an inmate of a sani
| tarium in Berkeley for about a year.
i Since his return to work it was ob
; served that he had flighty and moody
i spells, but as lie always did his work
promptly and well and was courteous
nothing was thought of it. At ha!f
'past 9 o'clock yesterday morning
Chief Clerk E. Ty. Maslln observed
that Branch was tinder the influence
of liquor and he reproved him for it.
Branch received the reproof with bad
grace and went to his desk mutter
ing.
On making his first appearance in
the office in the morning Branch had
told Clerk Gorham that he feared
that something dreadful was about to
happen to him and he requested Gor
ham to take care of him should the
contingency arise. After Branch had
gone muttering to his desk Gorham
stood near him. Suddenly and with
jout a word of warning Branch picked
up a steel eraser and jabbed himself
viciously in the throat. Gorham,
Maslin and others sprang upon the
desperate man, who continued his at
tempts to stab himself, and succeeded
in wresting the weapon from him.
Branch's position is that of general
clerk and his salary is $1600 per an
num. He was appointed on August
14. 1875.

check. Ridley alleges that on June
25 Jackson hired an automobile from
Ex-Judge Maguire appeared for the
union and T. C. Van Ness took care
of the case for the plaintiff. Judge
Hunt suggested that as the points in
volved were new here in the courts it
would be well to submit the present
case as a test and try it upon facts.
The attorneys for both sides agreed
with him and it was decided that the
Stablemen's Union should answer on
Tuesday next and that the trial should
be held on Thursday. (
Upon the point involved there has
been no judicial ruling this side of
Chicago and there is an anxious inter
est in the outcome of the pending case.
The Citizens' Alliance is backing
Pierce's prosecution of the union.
A test case is to be made in the
courts involving the right of labor
unions to maintain pickets and prose
cute boycotts against persons and cor
porations employing non-union labor.
Yesterday was set as the day for Judge
Hunt to hear the order to show cause
why the injunction against the Stai 'e
men's Union should not be made per
manent on application of E. G. Pierce,
proprietor of the Nevada Stables,
whose business has suffered from the
pickets and other representatives of
the union who have tried to divert his
patrons.
Steps were taken to prevent peddlers

Complaint has been made that hood
lums enter the Japanese tea garden at
night, owing to the fact that a por

unfenced. The superintendent was re-,
quested to, have the matter attended
to. The board adjourned at 4:30.
The Board of Park Commissioners
held its regular Friday meeting yester
day afternoon at 2 o'clock, and many
subjects of importance were discussed.
The first matter for consideration was
the award of contracts for tea, coffee,
sugar and flour for the children's quar
ters and the Japanese tea garden for
one year. Also contracts were given for
the supply of hay and feed. John
Rothschild & Co., Hooper & Jennings,
H. Huddleston & Co. and West, El
liott & Gordon were the successful bid
ders on groceries. H. Aigeltinger and
Somers &. Co. received the feed con
tracts.
Frank J. Symmes, on behalf of the
Merchants' Association, appeared be
fore the board to request that the leave
of absence granted Mr. Wilcomb be ex
tended thirty days. Mr. Wilcomb has
charge of the exhibits in the San Fran
cisco department at the fair. The re
quest was granted.
Tho report of Acting Superintendent
J. M. Cleary referring to the park
preparations for the Knights Templar
conclave was accepted.
A petition from property holders was
presented to the board requesting the

THREE CITIZENS WHO WILL BE
PROMINENTLY IDENTIFIED WITH
FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.
The Sobrante was granted to Jose
and Victor Castro by the Mexican Gov
ernment in the spring of . 1841. The
tract consisted of 19,982.49 acres. The
Castros deeded away the entire prop
erty two or three times, and certain un
located parcels of it many times more.
Most of those who thought they had
secured the whole or a part of the prop
erty assigned their titles to others,
who in turn sold and devised their
claims to others yet. There were mort
gages/sales and transfers without num
ber according to the record. Then there
were others who had' settled on por
tions of the land and who claimed own
ership.
â¢The contests appear to have begun
shortly after the Castros acquired their
title. The court could not delve very
deeply into the early disputes through
lack of data. The case just decided
was begun sixteen years ago.
The heirs of Edson Adams and asso
ciate claimants under a deed by Victor
Castro get a portion of the property
they sought. Emily B. Hopkins,
against whom Adams brought suit for
a part of the land he claimed, gets 232
acres. The Tripp faction loses its con
test. A part of the John Wilson claim
is allowed. Wilson was supposed to
have received one-tenth of the Sobrante
as a legal fee for proving title.
The action against some of the "set
tlers" Is barred by the statute of limi
tations; in the cases of others the Ad
ams faction wins. Sarah A. Wilson and
her associate claimants lose their fight.
The deed of Victor Castro to John
Frisbie and Ramon de Zaldo is held to
have been illegal and to have invali
dated a large number of the claims.
The Supreme Court has handed down
its final decision in the Adams-Hopkins
suit, and the prolonged litigation over
the Sobrante is at an end. The argu
ments of the scores of claimants to the
valuable Contra Costa County property
are all answered, and there can be no
further appeal. The great tract of land
is divided into numerous sections, more
than forty Â¦ lawyers have one less case
on their hands and the courts are rid
of a hopelessly tangled suit. Most of
the original litigants have passed
away. â¢ â¢Â¦
'John R. Wood lost his position as
â¢ paying teller of the Crocker-Woolworth
Bank because of the publicity riven to
â¢ the charg-es made by his wife. Ada M.
â¢ .Wood, in her- suit for divorce. Mrs.
: Wood commenced her proceedings on
June J6 and alleged that her husband
.* had been unduly Intimate with Louise
'Tyler, postmistress at Mill Valley. Mrs.
i Wood asked the court to allow her $150
a month alimony, 5100 costs and $300 at
torney's fees pending the hearing of the
case. Wood was cited to show cause In
â¢ Judge Graham's court yesterday as to
Â¦why the amounts should not be paid,
and he Â¦was so" successful in making a
showing of poverty that Judge Gra
ham ordered him to pay only $30 a
month for the support of his wife, and
disallowed the demand for attorney's
fees and costs.. Mrs. Wood's attorney
said that under the circumstances he
â¢would waive attorney's fees, but was
' only anxious to get something for the
! support of his client.
Â¦ ' Wood's plea of Inability to pay was
. made in an affidavit filed by his attor
neys'. Knight & Heggerty. In It he de
. clar'ed that he owned property In Mill
Valley worth $6600, that it was mort
pagred for $2550 and that his debts
" amounted to $11,000. In personal prop
". erty he owned a saddle horse worth
$150. three saddles worth $50 and a few
"jewels of" nominal . value. The showing
on' the wrong side of the ledger was
surprising for a bank clerk, and he
pave it in detail as follows:
At the. time his wife commenced her
" action for divorce he was employed by
the Crocker-Woolworth Bank at a sal
'- ary of $275 a month, and the day after,
because of the publicity given to his
â¢ wife's charges, he was discharged from
' his position. At that time he was and
1 is now the owner of five parcels of
realty in Mill Valley. On two of the
' lots -was located the residence in which
he and his wife lived before the action.
This was rented for $50 a month, and
hf says six? received the June rent. It
was .valued at $4500 and was mortgaged
: fur $2100. He declares that .maliciously,
â¢ and in Â«rder to further ruin him, she
removed and secreted all the furniture
. and fittings in the house, and he was
" tcmpelled at great expense to replace
â¢ the articles removed. The three other
"" parcel* of land, he s.ays, are worth $1SOO
: - and he owes $450 on them. The value i
"vof all is $6600 and the mortgages
amount to S2550.
Since he lost his position, he says,
. he has be^n unable to get another and
*. is living 1 at the home of his parents.
â¢ lie has not more than $25 in cash. He
â¢ says he owes $4760 50 for borrowed
" raoney, and on a suit" for payment of
' that debt all of his real estate has been
attached. He owes $3400 to the Crocker
â¢ Bank, by which he was em
"jiioyed and $33 50 to Henry Steil and
â¢ $200. to the Italian-American Bank.
Wood s"aid the demands of his wife j
were unreasonable. The court held the ;
same opinion.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
'"by Max UpQwftz against Ellen Lipo
; vitz for desertion, Doris D. Benton
against John D. Benton for neglect, j
Frank Bllyue against Katie Frances
" Eilyue.for desertion and Amelia Butler
â¢figainst P. C Butler for cruelty.
