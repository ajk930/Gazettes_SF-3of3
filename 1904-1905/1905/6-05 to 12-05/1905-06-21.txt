In his report , Secretary Taf t says ' there

that he V was . indiscreet. '-, The report , says
that ' Mr? Loomis was not justified \u25a0; in be

, "most cruelly slandered,"^ commends him

met thÂ« charges,- and ; points out' that 1 Mr.

PHILADELPHIA, June 20Â«â One of
the most sensational cases of forgery
that has ever been brought to light In
financial circles of this city ww dis
closed to-day, when It was announced
t_hat certificates calling for small num
bers oÂ£ shares of stock bad been fraud
ulently raised to hundreds of shares,
causing; a loss to certain bondholders
end trust compaales of thin city of
from $Tso,oCtt to $1,000,000.
The forgery involves the name of
Benjamin H- Gaskill. who went to his
grave four weeks ago. Gaskill was
the sole member of the banking and
brokerage conc-ern known as Benjamin
H. Gaskill & Co. He had offices in the
financial district and his credit was
considered gilt-edged
. Gaskill died about four weeks ago
and at the time of his death he was
believed to be worth about half a mil
lion dollars. He left no will and ad
ministrators began to close up his busi
ness.
A patron of the firm, whose name is
not given, bought from the estate 100
scares of PhiladelpJri^-5"-raÂ«*UwÂ»âCom
pany stock and'lOO shares of stock of
the United States Steel Corpo'ratlon.
He turned his account over to E. C
lliller &. Co.. which firm sent the 100
chares of traction stock to the Phila
delphia Traction Company's office to
have the transfer recorded.
FORGERIES ARE EXPOSED.
The certificate did not agree with the
company's books and an investigation
ehowed that the certificate had been
raised from six shares to 100. The dis
covery was reported to E. C. Miller &
Co.. which firm immediately notified the
gtock Exchange, of which Gaskill was
a member, "which in turn sent out no
tices to its members not to receive
ctock certificates from the Gaskill
estate, A further investigation brought
to light a surprising state of affairs.
It 'was found that Gaskill had
credited blmsvlf on hiÂ« own book* with
COOO shares of Philadelphia Traction
xtock, valued at approximately $080,000.
while tbe traction rorapany'a books
Â»bowed be had only 40 nhares. It wan
also discovered that' he had raised
stock certificates of the United Rail
ways of >ew Jersey frum two to 200
and certificates of the Frankfort and
>Â«mihÂ«ark Mreet Railway Company of
this city from two to twenty. The lat
ter stock Is worth 9430 a Â»hare.
I Gaskill kept two accounts, one re
cording the transactions of his custom
ers, which was correct, and another
giving his own transactions. His books
showed that he was losing from $15,000
to $20,000 a year in his business. His
method of operation was to obtain cer
tificates of gilt-edged securities calling
for one. two, three or some other small
number of shares, raise the figures and
g-ive them as securities for large loans.
BANKS WILL LOSE HEAVILY.
. At least Â«tx banks ant trust- com
imntn of this city admit lioldfnir fraud
ulent securities for larjje loans. ' Xot
one of tlie Institutions will make pub
lic the umoant of money It advanced,
hut a financier who haa been making
on Investigation said to-nlfcht that the
amount of money loaned on the raised
certificates would aggregate between
(TSO/tOO and 51,000,000. It Is believed
\u25bccry little will be recovered from the
estate. "";.-"â¢
* Gasklll was about 41 years of age
when he died and was a high liver. He
was a member of the Manufacturers'
and other clubs and was well and fa
vorably known. The administrators of
the estate. Lincoln L. Eyre and George
M. Wagner, have retained John G.-
Johnson to protect the interests of the
estate.

LOWTHER AS ; SPEAKER
NEW YORK, June 20.â The Times has
the following from London: It is a ques
tion whether Professor John Butler Burk,
at Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge, has
unveiled a great scientific truth in his ex
periments with radium or has simply ob
served a curious chemical phenomenon.
In one of the newspaper accounts, the
statement is made that; Professor Burk
has almost certainly demonstrated that
spontaneous generation . is possible. In
explaining his experiments. Professor
Burk says:
"I take some bouillon as a culture medi
um, consisting of extract of meat, dilut
ed in <listilled water with some gelatine.
A little salt and pepsin are added and
this is rendered slightly alkaline by lit
mus. The radium is then put in a tiny
tube, sealed and then immersed in a test
tube containing the gelatine and steril
ized at high temperature under pressure,
as otherwise the bouillon would boll and
evaporate. When the test tube is cooled,'
the tube containing the radium ' is
smashed by a' "mechanical contrivance
without opening the tube containing the
and the radium' ls- dropped 1 on
the gelatine.
"After a few . days. In . my experiment,
cultures resembling, bacterial- growthide
veloped, and in a fortnight they became |
extensive. The tube, when opened^at the
expiration of a. fortnight, showed, by the
aid of the most powerful microscope,
Email bodies resembling diplocci. but
varying in size, ranging from the minut
est specks to one sixty-one thousandths
of an inch in diameter. The large ones,
upon reaching a certain stage of develop
ment, showed nuclei, and when they
reached final development they were sub
divided, which fact is conclusive that they
are not crystals.
"These radiabes, as I have christened
them, are not bacteria, as the tubes con
taining bouillon but no radium produced
no effects at all. This seems to be or
may bo a primitive form of life, and it is
possible that after countless generations
it has developed into the bacteria as we
know them, because all. bodies arc radio
active more or less. The earth itself is
slightly radioactive, and it may have been
ihe source of life which it would have
taken thousands of years to produce from
radium. ' - Â« "

the secret of life in radium. There
was much discussion of the discovery

Oyama a* 'chance /to administer: to the

Government has done" nothing beyond
supporting President Roosevelt's efforts
to secure the earliest meeting of the
peace' plenipotentiaries and the submis
sion by Japan of terms; likely to be ae-*
ceptable to Russia: \ With overwhelming
forces at his command, it is felt in mili
tary circles that Oyama is In a position
to deliver a ' crushing defeat ~to General
LinevitchJ
ThÂ« recent movements of British cruis

that the Admiralty has again undertaken

took place within five minutes of the loss
of the battleship Hatsuse, from the same
cause, a mine. -^ \
â¢ When the Yashlma struck the mine
the Hatsuse and the cruiser Yoshino were
sinking. Captain Sukamoto of the Yasi*.

base, sixty miles away, but when near
ing the base the Yashima was filling so
fast that the idea of saving her was
abandoned. The crew was ordered to the
Kasagi and Totsuta, which were con
voying â¢ the crippled battleship, and the
Yashima went down in twenty-five fath
oms. The tops of her masts can still be
seen above water. The squadron which
accompanied the Yashima when she was
destroyed consisted 'of the" Hatsuse, Yo
shlno, Shlkishima,' and Totsuta,
three battleships and three cruisers.
The Suikishima was also in danger of
sinking when going to the assistance- of
the Yashima, but withdrew to safety be

RUNAWAY, IS FOUND.â Raymond Taylor,

ter last Friday, was found yeÂ«terdajr.
One of the reasons advanced for the in
ability of many of the employment agen
cies -to ' meet / the â¢ large number of calls
for domestic' help is that many of the
girls are learning special - lines of house
work, such as cooking and waiting. Last
year the average wages for general
housework were In the neighborhood of
$3 50 and $4 a week, but this year there
has been an advance in the scale to 54
and" $s : a' week, \ many receiving j as ' high
as $6 and 17.
By a careful canvas among the leading
bureaus it has - been found , that only 75
and 80 per cent of , the. calls for girls for
general housework are being filled.
i The Swedish and Norwegian girl-of-all
work still holds her place In the popular
demand."
CHICAGO, June 20.â The demand for
girls for general housework In Chf cago
is much larger than the supply. Man
agers of a number. of the large employ

The procession was the largest since

HAVANA, June 20.â The body of Gen
eral Maximo Gomez was Interred this
evening after a funeral service so re
plete with demonstrations in honor of
the dead general as to lead in several
instances to scenes of disorder. The
most serious trouble occurred while the
gi-eat procession was passing Central
Park, when some reckless young Cubans
rushed toward' the field gun caisson on
which the general's remains were borne,
demanding permission to carry the body.
They were thrust back and then a bigger
crowd rushed forward and swayed back
and forth across the broad street tem
porarily disorganizing the procession. The
arrival of big forces of rural guards soon
resulted in the restoration of order and
the burial of the remains of General Go
mez was accomplished just before sunset
in the presence of a great but quiet and
reverent multitude.
If the further settlement can be attained
without bitterness and prejudice, the Storthing
Is convinced that what has happened, will
prove for the lasting welfare of the northern
peoples. For the sake of the north the
Storthing addresses this appeal to the people,
which, by its magnanimity and chivalry, has
attained for . Itself such an eminent place
among cations and with which the Norwegian
people desire most sincerely to maintain good
relations. .
In the belief that the Swedish people share
these views, the Storthing suggests to Swe
den's â¢constitutional authority that they enter
upon the negotiations requisite for a final set
tlement on the dissolution of the union, with
the recognition of Norway's new status and
her rights aa a sovereign state. The Storthing
is itself prepared to meet even* fair and rea
sonable wish that may t-e put forward to safe
guard the kingdom's independence and Integ
rity. Constitutionally the two peoples will
henceforth be separate, but at the same time
the Storthing is fully convinced that this will
lead to the development of a rood and trustful
relationship for the defense of their mutual in
terests.
feelings will, with Norway no longer occupy
ing a position offensive to her national Inde
pendence, once more grow apace and insure
the entrance of a mutual understanding be
tween the peoples.
The Storthing, as already stated, and the
Norwegian people do not feel any bitterness
or animosity against your Majesty or the
Swedish people. The statements to the con
trary, which, possibly, were uttered on occa
sions, have wholly and solely been grounded
on dissatisfaction at Norway's position in the
union and as that source of bitterness and ani
mosity would disappear with the dissolution
of the union Its effects also would vanish.
Ninety years of co-operation In material and
Intellectual labors have awakened in the Nor
â¢wfecian people feelings of sincere friendship
and sympathy for the Swedish people. These
The Storthing recognizes fully rour Maj
esty's potation and never for a moment has
doubted that your Majesty's decisions are In
accordance with what your Majesty has re
garded as the rights and duties of the crown.
At the tarr.e time the Storthing is desirous, of
addressing an appeal to your Majesty, the
Riksdag and the people of Sweden, with the
object of. contributing to the peaceful carry-
Ing through of the dissolution of the union and
the safeguarding of the friendship and accord
of the two peoples of the peninsula.
The Storthing has seen, from expressions of
opinion, that the resolution the Storthing
felt It to be its duty to the fatherland to
adopt in declaring the union of the two king
doms dissolved, has. In form and action, been
considered mortifying to Sweden. That has
never been Its intention. What has happened
and had to happen In Norway was merely the
Inevitable maintenance of Norway's constitu
tional rights. The Norwegian people never
Intended to assail Sweden <b honor. As Jjur
Majesty, in council on May 26, declared you
were unable to sanction the Storthing's unan
imous resolution for a separation of the Nor
wegian consular service, and as no Norwegian
Government could be obtained by your Maj
esty, the constitutional state of Norway was
co far disjointed that the union could no longer
be maintained. Upon Norway's Storthing,
therefore, was imposed the necessity of pro
curing without delay m. Government for the
country. Every other course was closed, all
thÂ« more so as your Majesty's Swedish Gov
ernment bad, on April 25. already explicitly
declined to enter Into new negotiations with
the dissolution of the uaion as an alternative,
in the event that It was found impossible to
arrive at an agreement in regard to a new
form of union.
Your Majesty. Norn-ay's Storthing respect
fully begs to address ycur Majesty, and.
through your Majesty, Sweden's Riksdag and
Sweden's people as follows:
What has happened recently in Norway is
the inevitable result of a combination of late
political events and cannot be altered, and as
It is certain that neither of the two peoples Is
dosjrous of returning to the former condition of
union the Storthing is o: the opinion that It
ought not to reconsider tfce ..various questions
of the constitution ar.d public law that have
been brought up in your Majesty's note to the
etorUting'a president la connection with the
itsoiutKrtus Â«d<tpted fend on-Trtilch the Storthing

MiÃs Phelps, who renounced society to
wed the man she loved, is a talented mu
sician. Her father is wealthy and a
prominent attorney.
Selp engaged in business,- opening a
small grocery store. He prospered and
has provided a home which the bride de
clares is good enough, j Rev. John H.
Houghton, rector of the fashionable St.
Mark's church, pronounced the couple
husband and wife.
DENVER, June 20.â Two years ago
Miss Enid Phelps. a daughter of Judge
A. C. Phelps, was a . \u25a0- i-lent in Denver
University and William 11. Seip was a
tramway conductor, running on the uni
versity line. Fate seemed to will' that
most of her Journeys to and from - the
university should be made on his car
and so they became acquainted. Last
night she became his bride, leaving her
father's mansion to live in the humble
cottage provided by her husband.
The Phelps family are members of
Denver's most exclusive society and Miss
Phelps was a social \u25a0 queen. When it
became known that she had given her
heart into the keeping of a street car
conductor her parents and friends Im
plored her to recall h*r promise, but her
love was steadfast. For two years she
waited for her lover to prove that he
was worthy, and by so doing was able to
marry with her parents' consent, as they
realized that she could not be dissuaded.
Speaking of Japan, the Count takes the
yellow peril view of the future. "Within
ten years the Japanese and Chinese will
have combined. They will have ' driven
every European out of Asia and closed
and locked every door. And they will
throw away the keys."
But they are going to see America. .\u25a0: ;
"We mean to gee it all." said the
Count yesterday. "We will spend a few
days in your city, of which I have heard
much. We will go to the Yoeemite, ,and
there hunt the big game. Then we. go
to Utah. The Prince wants to see that
strange race, the Mormons, if there are
still any left. After that we ' shall visit
Niagara and from "there to New York,
where we take ship for: home." : . :
Count and Prince left- Austria six
months ago for a tour of the world. The
Count is an old friend, he says, of the
Prince's family. The Prince's father is
dead. His mother, when she heard ,of
the Count's prospective tour abroad,
begged the old soldier to take the Prince
with him. And here they arc
The Prince thought of taking a run
through Japan to the Russian lines and
there visiting some chums among the
Czar's officers. The Japanese saw him
first, however, and soon showed that they
did not care to have an artillery officer,
with friends in the'enemy's hosts, wan
dering too freely about Japan and, would
not allow the little excursion to the.Rus
sian camp. Â» .
Then came the Count's plan to visit
Port Arthur. As a military man nothing
would interest him more. He was through
the Boer war in South Africa as a mili
tary observer with the British army, and
he was anxious to do a little observing
on the scene of the famous siege. But
the Japanese, politely but firmly, told
htm nay. They were most pleased ! to
meet the honorable and distinguished
foreigner, and if he would accept their
miserable entertainment they would be
his slaves for life.' As for Port Arthur,
the honorable private counselor of that
other Emperor might sicken and die of
the hardships of the Journey, and even if
he survived there was nothing there
worthy the attention of the great Eu
ropean military genius. \i
There was no Port Arthur If or the
Count and no vedka-fest in the Russian
lines for the Prince. \u25a0â¢'\u25a0: y".
There are eighty-one letters of steel en
graved script . on his visiting card,' ,but
neither that master-piece , in black and
white nor the fact that his companion
was a Prince could coax from !the Japa
nese Government the permission, â¢ sought
by Lieutenant .Field Marshal Count " Hub
ner, private counselor of his Majesty the
Emperor of Austria, to visit Port Arthur.
Tne refusal was given ; most . politely, but
it meant "No," and the gallant Austrian
has come away from Japan feeling as
if the Mikado had slammed a door in his
face. He Is going back to Europe to tell
his Emperor all about the brown and yel
low peril.
In spite of hss script-covered card and
his grouch against the people of the is
land kingdom, Count Hubner is ! a pretty
fine old soldier and won from bis fellow
passengers on the Doric the verdict ; that
he was a "good fellow." Prince Win
disch-Graetz, his aid de camp, is re
lated to the Emperor, is a mem
ber of one of Austria's noblest fami
lies, and holds in the Austrian army a
commission as lieutenant of artillery.
The Prince, who has only twenty-three
years to the -Count's three score 'and
more, also' "made good" in the. field of
good-fellowship. :_: _ ".â¢ '
President Swarthing made a speech,
during which he said that the hopes of
Sweden in regard to the union had van
ished and Norway's negation of the ques
tion had been accomplished In such a
manner that It would be very difficult
to make any attempts to reopen the ne
gotiations. He was certain the members
realized fully their responsibilities toward
the nation and the future. He hoped,
however, that- the result of the proceed
ings ot the present Riksdag would record
the honest desires of SwedÂ«n.
The proceedings in the Lower House
of the Riksdag were opened with a short
address by M. Hedin, the senior member,
after which Premier Ramstedt an
nounced that King Oscar had reappointed
Mil. Swarthing and Pehrson to be re
epectively president and vice president of
the House.
STOCKHOLM, June 20.â The Council of
State at a meeting to-day adopted a
proposition which will be presented to
the Riksdag to-morrow. According to the
best information, the main points are
that Sweden refuses to recognize the
one-sided dissolution of the union by the
Storthing, but the Government asks the
Riksdag for authority to enter into ne
gotiations with Norway In order to es
tablish the basis for a dissolution on
which both countries can mutually agree
and the amicable relations of the two
countries be maintained.
The sessions of both chambers of the
Rlsdag were opened to-day. Baron Es
sex took thÂ« chair In the Upper House
by right of seniority. He announced
that Counts Sparre and Lundeberg had
been reappointed by the King, respective
ly, as president and vice president of the
House. There was no undue excitement.

The Dean Machine, having an abso
lutely positive counting mechanism, be
ing less liable to damage In shipping
handling and erection, . equal in; design,
material.^durability and workmanship
to the U. S. Standard, leaves no question'
in my mind but â¢ that It Is superior to
the v. S. Standard. I am, yours respect
fully, .-â. ... ;Â«4, :â. .. JAMES SPIERS, r \u25a0
Monerer Pulton Iron WoricV
In the U. S. Standard Machine I find
a totally different arrangement of
parts, the registering mechanism as a
body movesr ;
The particular slide or actuator oper
ating the unit wheel when operated
upon by a vote remains stationary the
non-voting actuator being held In 'place
by friction only, making it possible that
If the actuator was loose, through wear
there would be a possibility of Its mov
ing .by the momentum of the frame to
such a position allowing the unit wheel
to be absolutely unlocked and free to
revojve. I/, when in this position, the
unit -wheel were unbalanced and loose
on shaft, tho same would revolve and
show a false register. There Is a fur
ther possibility that if the momentum
was severe enough to cause the actua
tor to be thrown its entire distance, a
false register would take place.. On the
register that is being operated on- by
the voting key there is. one position of
the actuator which leaves the - unit
wheel unlocked, and if this wheel was
loose and unbalanced and the â¢ move
ment of the whole mechanism slow a
false register would take place. -'
The machine is well designed, with
good workmanship. The glass ' back
necessary to protect the counters from
manipulation is liable to breakage in
transportation, and should any particles
of this glass get Into the soft metal
counters, it might derange the machine
The center of gravity of this machine is
high, necessitated by an understructure
to bring, the working face to the proper
leveLÂ£Â«%CnaanpMed(Ufe' - - > *
As to the general design of the ma
chine, I find it very compact and all
parts accessible and free from any me
chanical defects. The parts are so de
signed as to strength that in my opin
ion the machine will stand an unusual
amount of abuse, and can be handled or
transported without danger of derange
ment or breakage. The machine sets
close to the ground, making it stable
and less liable to accident when setting
up. The interlocking system and
grouping" mechanism I have examined
and found the same care of design ap
plied.
I beg to acknowledge receipt of your
letter or the 14th inst., inclosing a let
ter from Mr. Kelly, requesting me to
examine into the mechanical movements
of the Dean Ballot Machine and the U
S/ Standard Voting Machine. I beg to
submit the following: t
The essential part of any voting ma
chine is the registering mechanism, and
I have given this part the most.atten
tion.
In the Dean Machine I find the 100
wheel Is at all times locked and con
trolled by the 10th wheel, and this Is
locked end controlled by the unit wheel
and the unit wheel locked -ond con
trolled \y the actuator. The actuator is
locked and controlled by the main oper--i
atlng arm, which manipulates the cur- !
tain lever, and at all times during the
process of voting, and when the ma- :
chine is idle, I find the unit counter I
locked, allowing no possibility for the
counter to be moved by any external
force, such as jarring of the machine
on unbalanced parts. I also find that
should the voters get access to the
counting wheels, they could not alter
the count by the use of any Instru
ment.
The Supervisors ordered at that time
that an exhibition of the two machines
should be made for five days In the
Union Savings Bank Building, corner of
Thirteenth and Broadway. The ma
chines were exhibited as per request of
the Board of Supervisors. r '. .
To-day the matter came up agrain and
was put over for two weeks; a resolu
tion was, however, introduced, relieving
the machines from any further exhibi
tion, and Supervisor Kelly introduced a
report from Mr. James Spiers. Manager
of the Fulton Iron Works, who had
been employed by him to make an ex
pert examination of the two machines,
and report to Mr. Kelly. Following is
Mr. Spiers' report:

The California editorial party will be
a gay .one. There are many young peo
ple in it and the older ones are just as
full of life as these. The coaches re
sounded with laughter and animated
conversation as they were pulled away
from the mole. Every member of* the
party wore a handsome silk badge, yel
low, to represent the gold of the State.
On the button part was a'representa
tion of the great seal of California, and
the ribbons bore the name of the asso
ciation and the exposition It is to visit.
The excursion is expected to reach
Portland to-morrow .morning. The
editorial party will be met by repre
sentatives of the Portland Board of
Trade and taken on a trip up the Co
lumbia River, where a view of the Dal
les and the Cascades will be enjoyed.

of Portland, tendered by the Chamber

Of Your Heart.
It is the engine that forces
the blood to every part of the
body; this blood conveys the
nourishment that makes -flesh,
t bone and muscle; it also car-
ries off the worn-out particles.
' If the heart flutters or palpi-
tates^ it is weak, "and";is^work-
ing imperfectly, so V'that^tllc
body does not get this nourish-
ment; it also fails to throw off
the impurities, anid they re-
main to poison the system.
If it is irregular, skips beats,
or is painful, the heart is prob-
ably "leaky" and the circulation
poor. These conditions are
dangerous. You can make
your heart well, and keep it
so, with Dr. Miles' Heart Cure,
which is a heart medicine and
tonic thatâ strengthens tlie
heart nerves and muscles..
\u25a0 \1 have been 5 a sufferer for years
from nervousness and weak heart, and
I have tried all the doctors In - tho
community. They all told mÂ« that I
haxl heart trouble, but they failed to
. help me. My drugsrist prevailed upon
me to try I>r. Miles' Heart Cure, and
Restorative Nervine, saying - that If
the nrst bottle did not benefit me he
, would return the money. Every doso
. helped me from the ttaÂ© I began tak-
' - ing it. and after awhile my trouble
â¢ was gone entirely." ' .

HONOLULiU, June 20.â W. P. Hepburn,
chalrman : of â¢ the. Ways and Means Com
mittee -of ' the ' House ,of Representatives,
has spoken here*- of . the Hawaiian and
Philippine islands in their relation to the
mainland of the United States. He said:
I never have \u25a0 been favorably disposed to
the i colonial system. . I have never believed
that colonies were . a marked benefit to parent
nations. ', Colonies were always a weak spot
in a nation.* Colonies are ' more expensive to
defend than * any \u25a0 other portion ,of the state.
There .is \ apt .to be less of that complete
contentment that results In the completest
loyalty, no matter how beneficial the parent
government may try to be. There are always
factions that try . to foment < discord and breed
discontent so that I have always thought
that a colonial system is not an advantage.
Of course i there' are exceptions to that.
It sometimes happens that geographical con
siderations make ., it .- exceedingly â¢ desirable to
hav> some such . relation with another people.
The possession of \u25a0 the Hawaiian - Islands as a
defensive measure for the Pacific Coast Is of
great value to the United States. If we bad
net these : Islands some other nation would
have. lnsisted upon having them. In the pos
session of ' anybody else they would :be m>
menace : to our peace, but with our possessing
them | nobody I else can trouble us in the Pa
cific and therefore - 1 think there are. mutual
interests â¢< which . make it very desirable wÂ«
should' have the very - best of - relations with
Hawajl. -'\u25a0 \u25a0;: - â¢â¢'\u25a0\u25a0; - '.'.

' NEW YORK; June 20.â Upon the deter
mination of. the exact .time of, the death
of Wallace Andrews and his wife, who
were burned to death In their home in
this city on April 7, 1899, depends the
success or the failure of a contest for
$2,500,000 which was begun In the New
York State Supreme Court here to-day.
Andrews' will directs that his executors
organize an institution to be known "as
the Andrews â¢ Institute , for Girls, and It
left to 'the institution $2,500,000 of his $8,
000,000 estate, cutting off hia relatives
with $500,000.
Under the laws of 1860, still In force, a

ONE POINT AT ISSUE
IN FIGHT FOR ESTATE
The morning's session came to an
end with the reading and referring to

adjournment was taken until 9 o'clock

Delegate Smith arose to urge the claims
of Red Oak, lowa, but as there was no
delegate from that place the claim was
not considered. The disposition of. the
meeting appeared so unanimously In
favor of Pittsburg that the names of
St. Paul and Minneapolis were: with*
drawn and Pittsburg was unanimously
chosen for the eighteenth annual con
vention to beheld the third Monday
In June, 1906.
â¢. But -one unpleasant feature marred
the day's proceedings. Delegates John
J. Grant and Thomas J. Moran of | As
sistants No. 23, New York, appeared to
have some personal animosity that
they insisted on settling upon the floor
of the convention. For a time it ap
peared as if the two delegates , were
going to abandon Cushingr's Manual for
the more aggressive Marquis of ; Queen
bury rules t<v but the other , delegates
prevented a scene.
Following the installation of officers
came the nomination and voting ' on
places in which the next annual con
vention is to be held. The convention
has received offers from Columbls,
Ohio, and Pittsburg, Pa., but as no del
egate was present to submit the name
of Columbus that city was not consid
ered. Delegate John White of Pitts
bug and J. J. Grant of New York pro
posed Pittsburg, while Delegates
James W. Conner of Philadelphia and
Thomas Gorman of St. Paul urged the
acceptance of St. Paul and Minneapo
lis.
show where he had been 'delinquent or
false to his trust. He urged all to work
for. the advancement of, unionism,
which he declared was God's work,
and called attention to the pleasant re
lations between pressmen and their em
ployers.
The speeches of Vice Presidents Ran
dall, Warrington and . Ranagan and
Secretary-Treasurer Webb were very
brief. Webb dwelt principally upon
the financial condition of the organiza
tion. He cited as an instance of pros
perity that two years ago the interna
tional had only $8000 in the treasury,
while now It boasts $40,000.
At the conclusion of the speeches
the ceremony of Installation took place.
President Higgins administered the fol
lowing oath to the incoming officers:
"I do hereby pledge my most sacred
honor that I will faithfully perform
the duties of the office to which I have
been elected to the best of my ability
for the honor and welfare of the Inter
national Printing Pressmen and As
sistants' Union."

After thanking the convention for the
honor conferred upon him. President
Higglns Immediately launched Into an
earnest appeal for support and trust in
his policy. He reviewed his work for
the year, and defied any delegate to
The result of the balloting was re
ceived with applause as each success
ful candidate's name wai announced.
The greatest enthusiasm was apparent
over the announcement of the re-elec
tion of Secretary-Treasurer Webb and
the accession of John O. Warrington
to the board. Each of the successful
nominees was called upon for a speech,
beginning with President Higglns,
whose address was strong and opti
mistic.
The eecond day's session of the con
vention of the International Printing
Pressmen and Assistants' Union of
North America occupied but the fore
noon of yesterday, but during: that time
much business of Importance to the in
terests of the organization was trans
acted. The officers for the ensuing
year were elected' and the result of the
balloting was the re-election of the last
year's officers, with one exception.
Following the election came the solemn
ceremony of installation and the choice
of a convention city by the delegates.
Pittsburg outdistanced competitors and
\u25a0was awarded the honor of acting as
host for the eighteenth annual conven
tion next year.
One hundred and six delegates an
swered to their names at roll call on
the balloting, and one hundred and six
cast their ballots in the order of their
organization's place on the roll. Al
most from the beginning It was seen
that Martin P. Hlggins would carry the
convention for re-election as president
for the fourth consecutive time. Frank
Pampusch of Denver, his only oppon
ent In the field, trailed him throughout
the balloting which resulted In Hig
gins' receiving 67 votes to his oppon
ent's 39. or a majority of 28.
A pleasant feature of the balloting
was the re-election of Edward H. Ran
dall of Toronto to the first vice presi
dency. Randall has been vice president
for several years and his nomination
was received without opposition, he re
ceiving 106 votes.
While Ronald J. Unger of Denver,
â¢who was up for re-election as second !
vice president, began with a slight
lead, he was soon distanced by John
G. Warrington of St. Louis, who re
ceived 66 votes to Unger's 40. This was
the only change In the executive board.
Upon the announcement of the result
Ungcr generously moved that his op
ponent's election should be declared
unanimous, which was done.
William Smith of Chicago was de
feated by Fred Ranagan of Boston for
the post of third vice president by a.
vote of 74 to 82. William J. Webb, up
for re-election as secretary-treasurer
for the seventh consecutive time, de
feated Phil H. Ayres of New York by a
like vote.

"The new directorate is composed of D.
F. McGraw. J. Lewln. Frank R. Patton.
Boschke and myself. The old board in
cludes Boschke, Mrs. Actor and two
others. . We desire to rehabilitate the
Western Dredging Company, while
Boschke, apparently, is on a freeze-out
programme. The . company is hard
pressed. Banker Clark of Sacramento
holds a judgment against it for $7000 for
money loaned. The office furniture was
taken to-day on a chattel mortgage held
by Dr. Dodson. We claim our board ia
the legal board and we do not recognize
the alleged sale by the old board to the
Pan-American. That is the; situation
from our point of view."
Hes?e, when seen at his residence to
night, said an action will be brought
against the Pan-American Company to
recover the title of the patent and that
criminal proce.edlngs will be brought
against Inventor Boschke for selling the
patent twice. According \- to 'Hesse
Boschke spld.hls right to -the â¢ dredger,
which has "already cost 175,000, to the
Western Dredging Company for . 51,000
pharos of stock and recently he sold tha
came right to the Pan-American Com
pany .for 1.175,000 shares of stock. "
a raEEZE-oirr game.
"My client owns nearly 10,000 share* of
the Western Dredging Company stock,
which was In jeopardy, we claim, because
BoiÂ»chke had organized the Pan-Ameri
can Company, and there was every rea
son to believe that he Intended to try to
pet the patent out of our hands. The
Western Dredging Company built the
.dredger andvjawns the patent. We think
It is a very valuable one, and our fight
Is to prevent Boschke from controlling it
after selling to this company.
"This Is an attempt on the part of
Banker Clark of Sacramento to seize
the invention. He and his crowd have
taken out some contracts to do some
dredging at Point Richmond. I suppose
that Hesse is standing in with them.
"Boschke, like all inventors, is a child
In business, and has been Imposed upon.
He put JSS.OOO into the dredger and spent
years of labor in completing it. It was
the Intention of the directors to transfer
the rights to the patent to the Pan-
American Dredging Company. Hesse's
seizure of the minute book forestalls this
temporarily. In my opinion the so-called
board of directors elected by Clark have
no Jurisdiction. Clark owns 51,000 shares
of stock in the corporation. That gives
him the controlling Interest,"
The Western" Dredging Company's
troubles arise from a conflict between
Boschke and the corporation. The com
pany reorganized after getting into deep
financial mire, but found that Boschke
had a board of directors who claimed to
have sold the stock to the Pan-American
Dredging Company. It is asserted by
Attorney E. C. Robinson that Hesse's
action in removing- the minute book to
day was authorized by the new board of
directors. Robinson, who . represents
Hesse, said: . ;. ."
C. H. Sooy, the attorney who repre
sents the old board of directors of the
Western Dredging Company, made the
following statement:
It A. Mil :H CLARK IXVOLVED.
After a brief scrutiny of the. pages of
the minute book, the capitalist placed
it under his arm and r|in from the office
in the Central Bank block, despite the
protest of the secretary. When Mrs. As
tor was seen to-day she was seated in a
barren office. All the furniture and prop
erty had been removed, and, it is said, is
r.ow in the possession of some of the
warring stockholders. She refused to say
anything about her action in securing a
warrant.
Mrs. Astor tried bravely to hold the
fort in the interests cf the faction she
represented, but she wound up in a de
eertcd and bare office with hardly a chair
to s!t on. Hesso, it is alleged, tucked the
minute book under his arm and ran down
the street. The looting of the premises
thus begun by those who had interests
did not cease until the secretary found
herself holding down a headquaiters

District Attorney Boyd and Sheriff Tay
lor drove to the scene > of the drowning
and carefully went over the ground. One
person interviewed denied making the as
sertion that he had heard that two Chi
nese launchmen saw the' accused men
jump on Johnson's prostrate body and
then roll it overboard. An effort was
made to locate the Chinese on the launch,
and tri*e assistance of the Chinese Six
Companies of San Francisco has been re
quested.
District Attorney Boyd, when seen this
evening said that Sheriff Taylor and he
could not . find sufficient evidence to place
a charge of murder against the prisoners.
They will be held on. suspicion pending
further investigation.
' ' At the inquest on Johnson's body the
jury brought in a verdict of accidental
drowning. There were many rumors of
foul play, \u25a0 but investigation failed to
show, them trustworthy. According to
these rumors Barrett and Whitney
robbed Johnson and then drowned him in
three, feet of water.
Whitney, was brought to District At
torney Boyd's office, where he was closely
questioned by.; the District Attorney and
Sheriff Taylor. In straightforward replies
to the questions put by Boyd he stated
that ,on ;tbe night of Johnson's death,
Johnson,; himself and Barrett had been
drinking. He said they went down to see
Johnson \u25a0 aboard thÂ« launch and that
Johnson, in crossing the plank' connect
ing the wharf with the float, missed his
footing and fell into the water, striking
his head against a fender as he fell.
"Barrett and I," said Whitney, "jumped
overboard to Johnson's rescue, but on ac
count "of the heavy sea running we could
not do anything. We appealed to Chi
nese fishermen, but they could not help
us. We got the body the next day."
Whitney said Johnson had some gold,
but that he changed it into silver on the
day : of his death. This was practically
the . same testimony given at the Coro
ner's inquest. Barrett told the same
story.".. â¢

BERKELEY. June 20.â Two burglars
who had made elaborate preparations to
enter the offices of the authorities at St.
Joseph's Academy in West Berkeley last
night, and there rifle the big safe in
which the money and valuables of the in
stitution are kept, were foiled by Night
Watchman . J. Stadert, ' who frightened
them while they were preparing for their
Job.
A runnUie fight between the fleeing
crooks and the night watchman followed,
I the men finally making their escape, ap
j parently unhurt, the dense shrubbery on
| the academy grounds and the darkness
j aidinj them in avoiding capture or in-
I Jury.
The academy authorities, under the di
rection of Father Genebern, who repre
sents the Christian Brothers in control of
the institution, made an investigation ot
the premises, after they were awakened
| by the shots, and found that the would
;be cracksmen evidently were famlliift"
| with the premises, for they had re-. :
I moved the window-, of the room , used- as
| an office, Where the academy safe stands.
; It is supposed that the crooks knew of
the valuables which are kept In the safe, '
their work being confined to that part of
the academy. They had removed the"
window without arousing any "one, and
had the "watchman arrived a few" min
utes later he would have captured them.
at work- on the safe. A. few small tools,
| dropped in. their flight,, indicated : th^t
they had come prepared for 'an elabor
ate safe-cracking exploit.
A week ago St. Joseph's Convent, near
by, was entered at midnight by a bur
glar, whose presence was detected by
Sister Perpetau, who gave the alarm and
frightened the intruder. The police be
lieve that a gang of crooks have selected
Berkeley as the. scene for their opera
tions, various . minor \u25a0 burglaries having
been reported during the last j week.
Marshal Vollmer to-day arrested Daniel
Foley, suspected of an attempt to loot D.
H. Brans' grocery at San Pablo
and University avenues last Monday
night. Foley was taken at his residence
at Fifth and University avenue. The
store waa entered by two men, though
nothing of value was removed.
The police believe that Foley's brother,
Michael, an ex-convict, who was released
from San Quentin on June 5, worked with
Dan Foley in the plan to loot the grocery.
Michael Foley was sent up from
San Francisco in 1595, sentenced to serve
ten years -on a burglary conviction. The
police are searching for him,- and hope
to connect him with the offense for
which Daniel Foley Is held.

seems In store for J. T. and A. W.
Reynolds, the brothers who for we;ks
have patiently waited at the land office
door in Lewiston, Idaho, to have first
choice of valuable timber lands. After a
vigil of many nights and days they find
that before they can have the coveted 320
acres of white pine they must oppose tha
Northern Pacific Railroad.
One section of timber land in the town
ship was particularly valuable for lta
white pine. The Reynolds brothers visit
ed the land and were prepared to hie
when the title arrived on June 14. Fear-
Ing tliat others were after the same land
and anxious to have the first choice the
brothers went to the land office three
weeks before June 14 and from that Gz.y
kept constant vigil.
On June 13 the Northern Pacific land
agent ' offered a scrip covering the en
tire, section, thus necessitating the refusal
of the Reynolds' filing. Both applications
must now go to the General Land Office.
SOUTH PARK YOUXGSTEIIS
SIXG AT PALACE HOTEL
NEW YORK. June 20.â Yetta Green,
seven years old, died on Monday, fifteen
minutes after receiving an injection of
diphtheria antitoxin, administered by a
health inspector. According to her
father the child was perfectly well when
the antitoxin was eiven to her..
Dr. Darlington. Health Commissioner,
admits" that antitoxin caused the girl's
death, but offers no explanation except
that an air bubble might have been in
the syringe.
This was the first death from anti
toxin in the history of Board of
Health. The facts came to light through
the application of Morris Green, the
father, at the Coroner's office for a burial
permit. He told the clerk, between sobs,
that a heal Hi inspector had made a hur
ried call and, instead of paying any at
tention to. the baby, which was ill. waved
him : aside and Injected antitoxin into
Yetta, who was. in perfect health... In a
quarter of an hour Yetta was dead.
Coroner Scholes then ordered an In
vestigation and will hold an autopsy at
the Morgue to-morrow morning. The
Board of Health will take no action until
the death is explained by the autopsy.
Dr. Darlington says there was nothing
the matter with the antitoxin and the
inspector who used It was an experienced
and careful man. .
"It is a sad and inexplicable circum
stance." said Ur. Walter Benzel, Â»head of
the department of medical inspection.
"An air bubble in the syringe would. kill
in a few seconds. -Impure antitoxin
would not cause death for several hours.
The child lÂ«/ed fifteen minutes. We are
entirely at* sea as to an explanation."

PHILADELPHIA, June 20.â The arrest
of John W. Hill, who resigned last week as
chief of the Bureau of Filtration, on the
charge of forgery and' falsifying certain
books and papers belonging to the city
and the annulment of a J700.000 contract
held by D. J. McNichol & Co., were the.
dramatic developments to-day in r Phila
delphia's sensational political upheaval.
Hill entered bail in the sum of $10,000 for
a hearing to-morrow.
The arrest of Hill was the third that
has occurred in connection with city con
tracts since the Mayor beuan his fight
for : ' municipal reform. The warrant
charges Hill with having: committed for
gery, in that he made or caused to be
made a statement giving false estimate
of the work done by the firm of D. J.
McNichol & Co. on the' filtration plants,
and also with having falsified certain
books and papers of the city for the pur-,
pose of defrauding the city. Former
Chief Hill received a salary of $17,000.
The rescinding of the $700,000 contract
held by D. J. McNichol & Co. caused con
sternation in political circles. In revok
ing the contract the Mayor notified the
Director, of Public Works to immediately
take steps to 'advertise for bids for the
work and material remaining to be done
and supplied. The original value of the
contract- was $500,000. T>ut jon March 17
this was increased to $700,000 by. a sup
plementary contract.' Up to date $213,477
has been paid for work done.
The McNichol firm has had contracts
for about two-thirds of the work in con
structing the Filtration system. So far
the system has cost the city upward of
$22,000,000 and It is estimated that it will
cost about $5,000,000 more to complete the
work. Mayor Weaver said to-night that

Both officers were patrolling ' their

on Stockton street,; between' California
and fay. and Wren paces Filbert and
Green streets. Neither" policeman has
a clear record in the department. Nu
merous complaints have been made
against Kramer for drunkenness and
misbehavior. Wren was up before the
Board of Police Commissioners not long
ago for- drunkenness arid -was trans
ferred 'to Captain Duke, with the un
derstanding that he; was on probation.
From what could be gathered 'from
the many eye-witnesses of the affair it
seems that- Kramer- was I crazy drunk
and that he did not know how badly he
was injuring the woman. Several of
them tried to interfere, but they were
cursed and warned to stay-away If they
wished to avoid trouble. The language
used by Kramer in addressing his
charge was foul as, human mind cark
conceive. When the case is called there
will be fully twenty-five witnesses to
swear against Kramer. They do not
allege either, brutality or drunkenness
on the part of Wren, although. in the
original complaint he is charged w'th
both, but. they, say that he was inactive
and did not try to stop Kramer's in
furiated assault. ...'.\u25a0 . '.....'

created a sensation, and soon after their
arrest all fled *from the jurisdiction of
the courts and remained in hiding for
more than a year. Subsequently all but
one returned and stood trial, being ac
quitted. Mayor Weaver ul that time was

pastor since the lamentable death of his
wife members of his congregation were
hopeful that Dr. Hemphill might see
his way clear to" accept several months'
vacation and return to his liock and
friends to resume his pastorate in the
great temple of worship with which he
has been" so ardently identified.
The news came upon church folk as a
calamity, for the doctor has endeared
himself to the citizens with whom he has
cast his lot for almost thirty-five years.
Speaking of Dr. Hemphill's decision, the
Rev. George G. Eldredge, pastor of St.
John's Presbyterian Church, said:
lam etunned by it. I had no idea, of such a I
thing happening Dr. Hemphill will be j
greatly missed in San Francisco. In 'point of I
service be ;Â» the dean of this presbytery and
it is doubtful if San Francisco has ever had a
pastor of equal length of year*. It Is thirty
live years elnce he first came here, and \u25a0 Cal
vary Church will find it excesdinply difficult
to pet a man to fill the place which he leaves
\u25a0vacant.
Dr. George K. Frlnk. a trustee of Calvary
Church â This news has come as a great sur
prise, and while I know Dr. Hemphill has
taken the death of his dearly beloved wife
deeply to heart I am exceedingly sorry to hear
of his contemplated resignation. I hope he
will reconsider it and finally decide after a
change of scene and a visit abroad to remain
with us.
James Hogg. Â«. trustee of the church â Dr.
Hemphill and myself are very Intimate, but
be has not said anything to me relative to his
contemplated resignation. I know he has
been greatly depressed under the sad condi
tions. Should Dr. Hemphill go I. as others,
â¢would very -nruch regret It and the church
would feel keenly the loss of his ministry.
The few auoted voice the feeling and
views generally expressed yesterday.

On the anniversary of their wedding
day \ a Brussels couple named Dupont
quareled so bitterly that the wife, in' a
burst of passion, swore that her husband
should never again hear the sound of her
voice. She would there and then have
quitted the house, but her now penitent
husband implored ' her not to \u25a0 leave . him.
To that extent only/did his entreaties
prevail,- for: she kept the letter, of her
oath and never, in her spouse's presence
did she unloose her tongue. In other re

Although no such universal . custom Is

to remain mute for the first month of her
marriage. Her husband,' who naturally
was not In the secret, was so much;in

left her before the period of her ordeal
had expired, only, to return later when
apprised of the real reason for this un

A CORRECTION.
CHIEF ENGINEER WALLACE of the Panama Canal is evi
dently going to find that a successful execution of the great
task entrusted to him requires a wider range of talents than
. the special ones of engineering and of organization. One of the
difficulties which caused the failure of the 'French canal company
is now presenting itself for him ; to overcome. Americans who go
out there to do their quota of the big enterprise become dissatisfied
â¢ and will not stay with, the work. Reports say that crowds of men
go there on the steamers from New York, New, Orleans and San
Francisco, but also that they crowd back as soon as they have had
time to find out what it is they, went to. Strange to say, it is not
â¢ the fear of disease that is the deterrent, the .hospitals are not filled
alarmingty, but the conditions natural and administrative are such
that many of the men will not put up with them any longer than
it takes to earn enough to pay their way back home.
When Wallace was in the States two months ago selecting men
for the work, the steamers were taking them out in large squadsâ
sometimes fifty in a bunch, but later the numbers going began to
iall off, and the numbers coming back dissatisfied are increasing.
This condition is so serious that effective work must-soon cease un
less it be remedied. The expedient of employing foreigners may
'be one way out, but it should not be resorted to until* all reasonable
efforts are made to render the employment endurable^tb: Americans.
It is evident from the reports that the. class of employes refer
red to are not laborers. The laborers must -be mostly foreigners,
for Americans cannot stand manual toil under that tropical sun,
but that other work can be done by Americans without undue i risk
of health is plain. Statements from various sources thave been
recently published showing that we have been training far more
men for engineering vocations than we have work to supply them
with. For the energies of many of these young: menf who thus >fin>l
themselves a surplusage, the long, big jobat Panama should make
a good outlet. It is therefore to be regretted -that they refuse' to
confront and overcome the difficulties in the ; way. .The job may
not be as good as they expected or as their education deserves, but
it would be a tide-over while waiting the home States' fuller need
â¢of them,- and ; they would be gaining interesting experience watching
thej accomplishment of one of the world's greatest engineering jiiii

OSLER LIST FOR BRITAIN.
all alike.
The American story of high wages and work for everybody has
been told so many years that it is working to our injury. With
10,000,000 people in poverty we must begin the process of equal
izing industrial conditions with the poor countries from which we
are receiving immigrants, or we must put a bar against them all,
until our industrial expansion has absorbed our present surplus in
gainful occupation. The present situation is unbearable. No coun
try, however great its natural resources, can endure it long. Free
institutions cannot survive impoverishment of the people, brought
about by opening our doors to the evil moral and physical condi
tions of the overcrowded countries of Europe.
In addition to raising the head tax on immigrants, it is abso
lutely requisite that our naturalization laws be changed. When we
were forcing expatriation treaties upon Europe we needed more
people. One lure held out to them was the easy means of acquiring
American citizenship. In its day that was a perfectly proper Amer
ican policy. But conditions have changed. Citizenship to most of
the immigrants we have been receiving for several years means
peril to our institutions. It means the appearance in our policy of
the greeds, grudges and fanaticism ,of political ideas sprouted in the
civic and economic conditions of Europe, to the destruction of
American ideals and politics. It makes us the prey of parasitic
political diseases that weaken our government and injure our people.
The Civic Federation, paltering around the symptoms of the
problem, appears to think that the whole difficulty is one of dis
tribution. It proposes that rich philanthropists shall purchase vast
tracts of land to give to immigrants, assisting them to reach it and
make a settlement. When Oklahoma was opened and when various
Indian and military reservations have been opened for settlement,
the rush and crush of American citizens to get land prove that land
is getting scarce for our own people. This being jso, is there any^
good economic sense in giving large tracts to immigrants as a
charity? Charity begins at home. If rich philanthropists propose
to buy land and give it away, let them begin on the ten millions of
our own people reported to be already in pauperism and want. It
is not at all necessary to import objects of charity. American phil
anthropy can find enough right at home.
The immigration authorities should take notice that all these
plans for the distribution and endowment of 1,000,000 immigrants
a year prove that they land in violation of the existing laws, which
forbid the admission of pauper immigrants.! We don't want people
who have to be "distributed" by charitable organizations. Reduce
our immigration to the small number who are able and willing to
distribute themselves is the proper policy. A half century ago our
immigrants needed no help. They took care of themselves. They
added to the sanity and strength of the country. They were rapidly
assimilated and were a useful contribution to the national force.
They were a loss to the countries they left. The test of that was
the difficulty we experienced in compelling Europe to recognize the
right of expatriation and treat a naturalized citizen of the United
States the same as a native. Now the whole aspect of the issue has'
changed. Europe is now glad to get rid of the. million a year that
are coming. Governments, national and local, are known to facili
tate the emigration of the class we are getting.
The contrast between the past and the present in the attitude
of Europe toward emigration should be a sufficient warning to us.
The Civic Federation will do well to make a deeper study of the
economics of immigration, in order that it may learn that congestion
of immigrants in New York and other large cities is the symptom
of a disease that is not cured by charity.
<yHE Civic Federation in New York has taken up the lmmigra-
I tion question. That city is becoming congested. A majority
* of the immigrants who land there stay in the city. Most of the
fraction that moves on seek other cities already infested by their
relatives or countrymen. The whole mass is either an increment to
-our pauper population, or, by crowding our industries, produces
pauperism among our native people.
The statement is made, and is not disproved by any counter
statistics, that we have already 10,000,000 people in pauperism or
on its edge. What economic use, under such circumstances, can
we -make of an annual immigration of 1,000,000 new people? That
increment continually overlaps our industrial expansion. It is ex-.
; cessive, a surplus of' humanity for which we have no need. With
annual vacancies in our industrial population of about 500,000, and
with our own population reaching the working age in a number
equal to or in excess of that, it is a plain proposition that immigra
tion means pauperism to the immigrant or the native. This is a
demonstration. It is an economic and mathematical fact.
â¢ The Civic Federation may tinker with insufficient plans for
dealing with the evil, as it has. The real solution is in stopping the
excessive and unnecessary and unwelcome addition to our popula
tion by immigration. That is the only effective means, and is de
manded as much by the interests of the immigrants as by our own.
There are various ways by which this may be done. First of all it
is absolutely necessary to treat all races and all nations alike. Mr.
Sargent, the National Commissioner of Immigration, admitted this
in a recent statement. We should play no favorites. ' By a head tax
of Sioo on immigrants we would probably reduce the flood to a min
imum. If this is not enough, make the head tax $500, and apply it to
DISTRIBUTING IMMIGRANTS.
But ' laughter? died * out as ' they, gathered

Smith Addlekin ' didn't ' laugh.*.-- They{ hurt.
â¢â It is not an easy j matter \u25a0to ; find ; tor
pedoes on sale. In' Chicago; at: this time

have^a 7 box of , torpedoes of the large ', slae."
: Smith bought ' them cheap {. because it
was out' of : season and he ".was ' naturally
thrifty, and returned to" the Beat .of war. 5 .
So If a r as |he could ; Judge; the \u25a0\u25a0 policemen

lof \ the \u25a0\u25a0 peace as
, they .(stood r' there,
something would be
doing, and it would
be for him to laugh.
In dutiful \u25a0 process of seemg 1 the local
sights he. went to?, .the stock yards, the
waterworks, ; and, on his most unfortu
nate day, started for j the public library,
to gaze upon its chaste marbles and
view the crowds goin after any one of
seven or eight
thousand great
American novels
published last year.
The public library,;
it will be remem
bered, lies imme
diately north and
adjacent to;., the
Btorm center of the
present labor dls
turoances. ,V
wOn his way to the
library, Just as he
passed the alley on
its west, he . saw
three .-; policemen
standing, idly, gaz
ing, up the; alley
that opened south
ward of them. They
were large police
men, - tall, big-foot
ed, broad of hip
and shoulder and
larger around what
had been their . re
spective waist lines
than either above
or below that bulgy
equator. \\ .
Thereupon, after
s t an d in g an d
watching the stal
wart backs of , the
three of them for a
minute or. two," dur
ing which they
maintained a \ dig
nified Quiescence, a
chance for a r? joke
came to him. He
thought that If he
could ."\u25a0;' set off a
good-sized child's
torpedo Just , behind
the three guardians
Mr. Addlekin stood and admired the
rounded contours of. the Chicago police as
they paraded the street beside caravans
of miscellaneous merchandise. On one
occasion he nearly lost his ear through a
piece of brick that was thrown into the
crowd where he stood In the hope of hit
ting, a strike-breaker. This gave him
something to talk -about when he
home. -...'. . \u25a0>:*:-. -. - '\u25a0\u25a0> \u25a0-.
But he was much more than a practical
Joker, for ho sought out lonely girls, es
pecially girls who were getting a little
along in years and consequently lacking
in beaux, and sat down and made wid
ows and orphans laugh at his funny
sayings, and got the local clergymen
home a little sooner, so that dancing
could beginâ and all that sort of thing.
Then, in'a moment unfortunate for him,
he went to Chicago during the strike.
SMITH ADDLE KIN had a position he
had made hla' own down In ';. little- ;
. ville, one of the busiest' towns : in
central Illinois. He was the prize enter
tainer .at all the . social functions given
all through the countryside. Not that he
arose and in a stately- manner declined
"Spartacus -to the Roman envoys," or
played "Jennyveeve, Sweet Jenny veeve,"
on the mandolin, or strummed the banjo,
or whistled "Listen to the Mocking Bird,"
or any stunts like
that. , He didn't,
because>.he couldn't.
Smith!s particu
lar province lay in
removing that
sense of segrega
tion, as common at
social gatherings as
at the University
of Chicago," which
sets all the married
women in one I cor-,
ncr talking about
babies, all t h c
married men ''out
on the porch smok
ing and discussing
crops, all the girls
giggling in another
corner talking
about young men,
and all. the young
men almost any
where/else talking
about that 'â them
selves. With" a few
well-directed re
marks generally of
a boisterous na
ture, he stirred
the various com
ponents of surprise
parties and church
sociables and the
like into a whole as
smooth and well
mixed as- eggs for
an omelet.
He was also a
practical joker. Be
.lng a kindly j na
tured man with red
hair, freckles, dim
ples, and a large
mouth, his jokes
seldom caused any
thing but" mirth,
as when he pinned
one of {Mamie
Lumpton's braids -j-- â : ; t-f
to the back of. Wesley Loveman's cut
away coat, : causing momentary dismay
and much laughter when they undertook
to tear themselves apart. It was largely
by merry little jocosities of this nature
that he removed the feeling of constraint
so likely to prevail in local gatherings
of all sorts.
Then she apparently went to sleep.'
After shivering behind the curtains for
a few minutes - Mr. Cone stealthily
crept back to bed. \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'' -'i . \u25a0 \u25a0
But the next day i his faith In his
ability to fool his Wife was! still un
shaken. , - -^ .
"There, I suppose that careless man
has fallen out of the ..window, and in
his raggedest nightshirt, too! .What a
sight he'll be when they find him In
the morning!" ;
To say that Mr. Cone became very
tired of this performance Is to put It
mildly. He determined to teach his bet
ter half a lesson with . a good scare,
and to that end rolled up a heavy
bundle of paper, .which he hid behind
the dressing case.' When in. the middle
of the night Mrs. Cone reminded him
of -the, window he got up,, opened it
wide, threw . the bundle out with a
smothered cry and stepped behind the
curtains to ..await developments.
The bundle landed with a thud on the
pavement. <\u25a0\u25a0 Mrs. Cone moved restlessly
and lifted her head at. the noise. Her
husband, behind the curtains, heard
her mutter: .;.
THE sun was just beginning to turn
the dewdrops -on Van; Cortlandt
Park t into glistening . genis when
Mr.. Conei of Caryl, ; reached his'home.
Mr. Cone is not his name, but he is as
well: known , by.; that as any other:. ' He
had 'come i from the southward, where

Carefully he entered;the::house./care

carefully began to divest himself of his
clothing. Mrs. Cone was apparently
deep in slumber, but -as Mr. * Cone was
about to retire she turned over,'-blink
ed . once : : or twice. , looked at * Mr. ? Cone
in a surprised way and said;
"Why, dear, what are you getting up
so early, for?" - v. \u25a0.-;,
"Ohâ ah, it's . such a fine morning I
thought I'd get iip and \u25a0 work i in the

"Isn't that splendid! You're a good

again and painfully: and gloomily took
himself downstairs, to the garden and

Presbyterian church reading the ser
vice. The bride, in white messaline
silk, was attended by Miss Ellen Lund

Jorie Gross as ring-bearer. Dr. A.
Hackett served the groom.'
The drawing-room. In which the
ceremony took place, was fairly abloom
with orange blossoms and their green
branches. Red roses, geraniums and
smllax dressed the halls, .while pink
and white predominated In the dining
room. A reception was held from 9:30
to 11:30, when Dr. and Mrs. Hoska took
leave. Both were students at the Uni

and Initiated their romance. Dr. Hoska

people of that district would favor In
every possible manner the new company,,
which is earnestly trying to carry out its
plans of constructing' an .electric road'
from Santa- Cruz to this city. . In a num
ber of ; cases . where the Southern pacific
Company's agents have : asked land own
ers for concessions the latter : have de
manded that the- Southern Pacific: give
some kind of written assurance of its in
tention to build a branch line Immediate
ly, but to this proposition the, agents de
murred. The Ocean Shore people an
nounced yesterday that they would-petl
tion the local Board of Supervisors . in
about a iveek for permission to enter and
lay rails in this city, and that work; on
the road will be hurried along as fast as
the grading can be completed and the
material delivered at convenient points
along the route.
A lively struggle is going, on down the
coast between the agents of the Southern
Pacific Company and . the newly \u25a0; incor
porated Ocean Shore Electric ; Railway
over rights of way. The Southern Pacific
Company, realizing, that "the \ new jj com
pany !s in earnest regarding its proposed
road, has ' set about t acquiring :a route
through the same territory, that, the elec
tric company intends to .invade,,'. but so
far the steam road - representatives have
found : . their | work fraught ' with J all kinds
of : difficulties. The land owners between
Santa Cruz and Colma are ; not .' disposed
to extend any privileges to the Southern'
Pacific, claiming that in their experiences
of the past the corporation has not -kept
its promises, to build a road and has only
threatened to construct one' when a rival
concern entered the field.: ~ s ;
Alexandro de. la Guardia, Consul from
Panama iln San â¢ Francisco, -is - authority
for .the -statement* that- the capital city
of his country will soon own and operate
a complete electric-car ; system [ through
its busy streets. No longer will ! his peo
ple be â¢ carried along : peacefully in the
quaint . barullas of the marketmen f or ; a
few balboas, but they will be hurried and
crowded In modern : street cars. Panama
will \u25a0{ take oh a new mark ' of progress!ve
ness, 5 the Stores â¢ will open early Jn the
mornings '- and i bargain counters will be
established for the women shoppers. With
the. electric > cars will come ambulances
and/ emergency hospitals, - appendicitis
and -spinal meningitis, ' automobiles and
cocktails; ' for with such a start Panama
will assume all of the luxuriousness of
American civilization. Senor Guardia is
In this city now engaging contractors to
do the 'work of laying the tracks apd fur
nishing the â¢' equipment -
The new car system is to' be very com
plete. It will' begin at the Elaza de
Annas and follow the main streets of the
city up to the fine white : statlo* of the
Panama : Railroad. Only the most .'mod
ern cars will be : purchased, embodying
both freight and passenger trains. They
will run continuously from 5;30 a. m. till
midnight. The construction and mainte
nance': of the electric line will be paid bjr
a chartered company, which has been
granted a fifty years*, franchise- No
passes will be issued l to the favored, and
every, one except the policemen on active
duty will be compelled to pay the equiv
alent of. five cents American for his ride.

Superintendent of Maintenance of
Way Wallace of the Southern Pacific,
under directions of General Manager
Calvin, Is making arrangements for the
annual inspection of the Western sys
tem of the road. ; A similar inspection
Is now under way on the Atlantic sys
tem. Few events. In the yearly experi
ence of the average railroad man Is
looked forward to with as much Inter
est by those connected with the operat
ing department as the annual'inspec
tion. It is a â¢ ceremony that means
much to employes of" the various divi
sions, who take good care of their'em
ployers' property, for the conditions of
the road for which I they are responsible
are carefully judged by a committee ap
pointed for the -purpose, and each man
is credited according to his merit as a
caretaker and rewarded.
Medals are awarded to section mas
ters for the best-cared-for, track, keep
ers of tanks are properly judged for the
manner in which they take care of the
property in their charge, division super
intendents get their Just share of rec
ognition, and the whole; thing Is finally
computed upon a basis of merit, and
stands as a permanent record sof the
men concerned. Tne j fact that General
Manager Calvin is known as one of the
most scrutinizing officials in the West
ern railroad world causes It to be gen
erally believed that the 'coming annual
Inspection will I be ; a '. record breaker in
the history of the Southern Pacific.

The "Composite Metal
Plate" of the Emerson
: : : Piano : : :
HP HE plate of a piano is the portion
1 [ which, with the frame, must stand
the tension of the stringsâ upon the
ability of the piano to stand this tension
rests the length of time the piano will
remain in tune:
The new Composite Metal Plate of
the Emerson, with its convexed form
of angular braces, allows a far greater
tension of strings than the usual plate
!t construction.
y This plate, attached to the unusually
heavy Emerson frame, is the reason
why the Erne rson always stays ?in
perfect tune so long. It has made the
Emerson famous.

Counsel In the case of . Ravlnl against
Chief of Police Dinan and the Grand Jury
to enjoin the defendants from raiding
the premises at 620 Jackson street, are
becoming belligerent . and forcing each
other to ! the witness stand in the hopes
of "turning, something up." This mode
of procedure almost caused a clash yes
terday between District Attorney Bying
ton j and Henry Ach, the Intervention of
the Court â¢ being' necessary to cool them
down. : \
Byington asked Ach to take the stand,
and with a surprised expression Ravini's
counsel obeyed.: - ' ;
'\u25a0 "Who is paying your fee?" asked By
ington. ;
;"Tha.t's immaterial; â¢< in fact, none of
your business," answered _Ach, "but at
the same . time ,. I * will answer it for the
good of my case. Why, Ravlnl Is paying
it:"-- '\u25a0\u25a0* :'/:\u25a0 " ::\- â¢â¢ -'..â¢â¢:

. "I understand the place is conducted
as a hotel," answered Ach. quick to urge
the point; ln favor of luVclinet.
"Tour ideas of what constitutes a hotel
are strangely^ distorted," answered By
ington.-- . ' t-_ ;: 7*
As Ach BhoweÃ no signs of willingness
to 1 assist "opposing, counsel " he . was -. re
leased j from the stand and later Byington
was called. J 'â .
"Didn't you and Foreman Andrews and
Mr. -Bowles of the Grand Jury go to a
place on Merchant. street and buy a bot
tle of wlnÂ». and 'offtr . protection to " the
Inmates?" asked ; Ach, . addressing Bying

"All ofithls Is very displeasing to me."
'said Judge Seawell, "and I, would request
that counsel conduct themseves as gen

I'ncle Henry's Seals sent one man across
the pan at Itiora Park yesterday after- 1
noon, while the best tho Angels managed
to land was a goose egg. Hitt, v.-ho :
winged them over for the San Francisco
bunch, won his game in the eighth by
poking out a hard drive over ' third, en
Ã¼blingr Parke Wilson to trot home with
she winning run. Only .'once did the An- <
pels have a chance to score. This was in!
the third, when, by a succession of safe
ties, they filled* the bases, but there was
nothing doing in the run line. After that
the wearers of the blue from the south
failed to get a man past the second sta
tion. /
In the third Hall, who was on the slab
for the Angels, was put out of the game
with a badly split hand. Spencer, the
Seals' second sacker, drove a hard one
straight into the southern pitcher's hands
and his ungloved mitt was put out of com
miFslon. The force of the bail caused
Hall to drop the sphere, but he went after
it and winged it to first in time to put
Spencer out and retire the side. Good
win took Hall's place in the box and
pitched fairly good ball for the rest of
the game.

: The butter dealers of the city also, have
complaint to make against the methods
of the administration of Napa Insane
Asylum in awarding contracts for sup
plies. Strong 1 reinforcement is given the
complaint of hardware dealers as set
Â£orth Jn ; yesterday's Call."; The butter
men may ..take the - matter before the
Board of Trade of San Francisco to have
that organization take some step toward
bringing about fair play. The provocation
ofthe butter trade, la based on an un
just course of trustees of the' asylum dur
ing a period of years. There is also talk
that coffee and tea dealers ' have- com
plaints to" make. . '. ,
Bids were opened for butter supplies at
Napa asylum on June 15. Just as a mo
tion was to be offered to; award a con
tract oneof .the parties present. It la al
leged, rose and called attention to the
fact that although his firm had offered a
bM, no mention of- the fact had been
madt. The bid "referred to was the low
est of any. Xo award was made. One
of the. trustees announced that all the
bids would be rejected, and that the trus
tees would .create a large dairy plant
sufficient to provide for all the needs of
the asylum. At this time, it is reported,
the' supplies for the asylum are purchased
in the open market because of failure to
maJte a contract to furnish* supplies of
hiittir. ; â¢' .
I*3*l ose who bid for the butter contract
a&Napa for the ensuing year were: Nor
teÂ«.'' Teller- & ' Roden, A..' !>. Lundy.
"W&aton. Pond & Harrold, Schulz, Nlg
gfcÂ« & Co., Luhman, Martlnelli & Creon,
Martin, Dangers & Caram, Brigham \u25a0&
Hoppe. Dodge, Swteney & Co.. Getz Bros.
& Co. and Hllmer & Bredhoff. The bids
were to supply 60,000 pounds of butter.
Last year, it is alleged, after the Napa
asylum trustees had 'awarded the butter
supply contract to a bidder whose offer
was higher than others. Judge Seawell
granted an injunction against the trus
tees to restrain them from giving the
contract to any other than the lowest
responsible bidder. The suit against the
trustees of the Napa asylum was brought
in the name of A. L. Lundy. but all the
butter houses united to pay the costs of
litigation. Some Interesting developments
may take -place to-day. _ -
STOCKHOLDERS WIN LAItGELY
BY SALE OF COALIXGA LINB
Pipe Constructed to Move -OH From
Fields to - Tide Water Brines \u25a0
Handsome Profit.
Parties connected with the deal for
the transfer of the Coalinga and Monte
rey oil pipe -line to the Standard Oil
Corroany say " that the transaction has
been' consummated, but that all the
particulars are not arranged finally."
The expectation Is that everything will
be. settled within the next few days. -.ln
business circles it is, reported that the
stockholders in the Coalinga pipe line
i'orporation wlllmakea profit of more
than- $200,000 on their investment on
the basis of the sale price, which is not
made public yet. \u25a0 The'pipe line was so
advantageously placed- : that It has a
commanding situation as regards trans
portation and the distribution of oil
and this, gives it added, value." The
vessels' thai have .been used in moving
the oil from Monterey, when^it was de
livered by pipe l^tie at tide water, will
also be. transferred. The deal has been
managed largely by Captain William
Matson. , *

Coffee and Tea Merchants
Are Chafing Under the
Treatment Accorded Them
Tl:e Dakota is drawing more than
twenty-seven feet and in the berjh
whore sh& is lying mere is ample water
to float her off even at low tide. And
there are a dozen other wharves in the
port where Dakota-sized vessels could be
acoorcmodatod with just as much ease to
her navigators and *ar<?ty to the vessel
Itsett. She will discharge about 2000 tons
or cargo during her stay here.
The Dakota is â¬30 feet long and V 4 feet
in beam. She towers above the water
Hke a many storied mansion and is said
to have preserved a. dignified steadiness
through the tumult of three days* terrific
etorm while off Cape Horn. The sailor
men on board the Dakota, whose pre
vious roundings of the Horn had been in
traa'ler and sail-propelled vessels, en
joyed that howling southwester. Sitting
under the lee oi the bridge the officers
of the liner watched the boilinp seas that
battered themselves Into harmless spray
asainst the armored sides of the ship,
listened to the howling of the wind and
laughed at the storm. in just such
ptorins most of them had suffered as only
those know who have helped to work a
hard-press* d windjammer. There was no
ehortening sail in the dark watches of
the night on the Dakota, and If the
flinty elect did come down the men whose
ekir. it cnee had battered and cut listened
to its rattle, tinder the dry shelter of a
Etout awuing and laughed again.
The Minnesota -was not finished when
ehe reached this port. The Dakota is all
ready for business. Her engines worked
well throughout the voyage and the
water tube boilers are sa.-. to have given
no trouble. Her passenger and freight
accoranjedations are identical with those
of the Minnesota, and like her twin sis
ter, the Dakota is arranged for speedy
conversion Into a troop ship. â - - .â¢â¢Â»â¢\u25a0
Â£he was flfty-two days coming from
New York and seventeen days from
Corcnel. Her officers are: Captain Emil
Francke, formerly of the American Line;
Chief Officer J. F. Roberts, First Officer
J. B. Barneson, Second Officer U. S.
Smith and Third Officer H. D. Glen.
With only one little red-stack tug
standing by in case the wind should
rtiove too hard against the liner's lofty
eides. the huge body of steel was brought
in from the stream and made to glide
into her berth as easily as a hand sliding:
ir.to an old glove. Once or twice the Da
kota brushed a pile. No damage was
uone, but the quivering of the wharf
gave pome indication of her relentless
strength and an idea could be formed of
the damage she could do in the event of
misdirection.
The Great Northern Steamship Com
pany? Riant liner Dakota, twin sister to
the Minnesota and one of the largest
ships Jn the world, arrived yesterday
â¢rom the Atlantic. Â£he Is on her way to
Seattle, from which pert she will make
rpjrular trips to the Orient In conjunc
tion with the Minnesota, the Shawmut
end the Trerr.ont. In spite of her great
e'.ze, the Dakota is r.ot big enough to
overtax the accommodations of this port.
Pilot Kcrtr. v.ho brought her in from
sea, fioekfd her at Broadway wharf No.
1 with far greater ease tnan some navi
gators dock very much smaller vessels.
Jn fact, the docking of the Dakota was
one of the best bits of work of its kind
ever done in this harbor.

""Oh, I know that my v boy haÂ» x been

Yerba Buena street when her son did not
return on * Monday, night. At - the . time
that this stnange premonition came to the
mother the lifeless body or her son, Ed

swimming - tank at St. Ignatius College
Gymnasium.
ioung ' ijutler had been swimming in
the -tank and it is believed was suddenly
stricken with cramps. The place was de
serted at' the I time " and nobody" heard his
cries for; help,- if he .uttered any. v The
body : was not recovered until " the tank
was emptied yesterday."
The premonition of Tils fate came to the
"mother on Monday night when her son
did not return^ '"I know rhe has : been
drowned. 1 am sure of it," she said. Her
\u25a0 other son and her sister tried to laugh
! away her! fears. - She -retired, but could
not 3leep. A mysterious something told
her that her boy lay ; cold and dead be-,
neath the dark -water.
About tt o"clock yesterday morning. Dep
uty Coroner James Murphy, who waa on
duty at the Morgue, received a call from
St. Ignatius Gymnasium. He was told
that ihe unidentified body of a, young
man had been found in tne ewimmlnst
tanlr. .' . ' ' - .. . -
When "Murphy went into the empty
tank and stooped to raise the body he
suddenly started back with a cry of hor
ror. â¢*AVhy, that is my cousin," he ex
: claimed. .
Butler was 22 yeais old and was em
ployed by the Southern Pacific Company
as a clerk. '

CHICAGO, June^ 2o. âWith" the exception of
a slightly easier tone at the opening the
wheat market : was strong - the ' entire session
A decline at Liverpool created some disposi
tion here to Bell at the start. ,;i As a result
Jvly was off a shade to %@%c at 87%@87%c.
CcmmlsEion houses. however, soon | became
active bidders. As a result sentiment quickly
changed Â»to bullishness, offerings being light
after \u25a0 the moderate selling pressure at \u25a0 thÂ»
opening. The advance started with a report
that yields of wheat In Southern Illinois would
be very small. Advices were received claim-
Ing that heavy rains In Kansas and Oklahoma
had done 1 much ; damage. . Rain was - reported
throughout the Red River Valley and in South
Dakota. Allegations :of damage by rust,
chiefly in Minnesota, were renewed. The
weekly report of the weather bureau. â¢ how
ever claimed that spring wheat was making
. favorable progress and that harvesting of
full-sown wheat was rapidly advancing north
v.ard â¢ Bearish advices, however, were prac
\u25a0 tically Ignored. Late In the session the â¢ mar-;
kctwas given additional strength by an esti
mate on the wheat crop of France. According
to an English expert the total - yield will be
about 288,000,000 bushels. These figures sug
gested the probability that France would have
to Import from America 50,000.000 to 60.000.000
bushels. During/ the last hour of trading
sSiertewere extremely active bidders, but the
demand continued \u25a0to meet with meager ofter r
Irfes - For July the highest point of the day

Xew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. June 20.â More stocks were
sold In the two hours before noon to-day than
during the full session of yesterday. In the
alternoon there was a contraction in the raw
of activity, but the sales for the day roae
to a larger total than for any day since carry
last week. The market obviously was still
largely in professional hands, but the traders
operated more freely and there were indica
tions of th* re-entry . Into the market of some
of the large semi-professional speculators who
have refrained from activity for some time
past. The buying movement was largely of an
experimental character. The market has given
clear evidence for several days of a hard
undertone. The volume of offerings has been
almost nothing and no liquidation is Induced
by any professional pressure. The assertion
is made and evidently credited among the
professional operators that the holdings of
stocks by commission houses at this time are
at an unusually low ebb. .and that weakly
margined holdings have been almost com
pletely cleared up. .The technical strength
of such ' a position makes; the market Invul
nerable to ordinary attack. The eagerness of
the professionals to see prices move in one
direction or the other prompts them always
to follow the line of least resistance. They
were Inclined to-day to pur prices up- until
tlio weight of offerings/ attracted by the ad
vance, should prove an obstacle. Realizing in
Reading was very manifest and this fact waa
a palpable check to the operation of the ad
vance. Some general effect on sentiment was
produced also by- the realizing In the Japanese
bonds, as theÂ»e have been the real leaders
of the small speculation for some time past.
There was some renewal of gossip of an In
tended Increase In the Louisville >and Nash
ville dividend .rate. Published reports -of the
undimlnlshed activity of steel mills in the
Pituburg district gave the Impulse to the rise
in United States Steel preferred. Satisfac
tion was professed over the 'better under
standing . reported between France and Ger
many, but foreigners, were sellers of stocks
tt a- small extent in this market. Foreign
money markets, . however, eased off and the
result was the reappearance of bankers' ex
change bills in the local market incident to
the process of lending foreign -funds here.
The day's rise in prices was very well main
tained through the dullness of the later mar
ket.
Bonds were irregular. Total sales, par
value. $2,660,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

There was; a stir of interest throughout
Judge Conlan's ; court .when ":.. Henry.^ P.
Brown advanced to "\u25a0. the bench to, answer
Patrolman Drolette's charge that he had
exhibited a> deadly weapon, to wit, - a
pistol, Jin a rude and threatening manner,
for he 'was*, the physical and sartorial an
tithesis of the ordinary^ Police Court de
fendant. The impression of youthfulness
conveyed. by his. slim, supple figure .was
intensified by , - his : strawberry-and-oream
complexion and his v sparse blonde mus
tache, and the; facial effect \ was : made
still more striking by a tiny Jet black chin
tuft. His garb was of good material,
fashionably: cut. J
* Ths policeman testified that the : primal
complainant in the case was a profes
sional messenger boy who uad informed
him that Mr. Brown was crazily brandish
ing a big revolver in his room on O'Far
rell street. The" lad stated that he; went
to the \u25a0 room In response - to a call ; from
its occupant received at the messenger
service office, and no sooner had he en^
tered the apartment than he was con
fronted by a. leveled pistol and com
manded/to depart if he did not desire, to
die on the spot. He promptly obeyed the
command and to the policeman he said
"the -gun looked as big as a' cannon.".
When the "officer - visited = the ;room he
found both - man and weapon. The for
mer was unquestionably crazed and the
latter was of maximum revolver caliber.'
He experienced no difficulty, however,' ln
taking * possession of both the . weapon
and; its owner.
In -explanation of his conduct Mr.
Brown said he was a tourist from Bos
ton, where he holds exalted, rank in the
fire ..department, and while â¢en route
across the- continent he purchased the
pistol, being Impelled to do -so by fore
warnings , received in Boston, where San
Francisco is ; popularly regarded /as ; a
place where no person's life is - safe, un
less he Is " constantly armed ' and ready
to kill. He did not intend to slay the
messenger boy, whom he looked upon as
a desperado on . pillage bent, \ but merely
to intimidate him. If the boy had burst
into the i room less abruptly, or if Mr.
I Mr.' Phillips/ somewhat chastened,/ then
consented to 'accept $35 f rom V Mr. ' Foley

ment yesterday in the libel suit entitled Yon

izes a new trial of the proceedings. The de

"You have a poor understanding," said
the Judge, "as to what the court said."
"I have a fairly good understanding,"
retorted O'Grady. "I desire to raise a
point as to your Honor's instructions."
The Judge said he would decline to
hear anything further. He again asked
if they had anything to Bay why Judg
ment should not be pronounced.
O'Grady persisted, saying he intended
to make a showing, but the Judge | cut
him off by saying it was not a proper
matter to bring before the court.
"I take exception," said O'Grady, "to
your Honor's ruling, and furthermore,' in
support of what I would have stated
and what I claim I have a right to state.
Intending to make a showing at this time,
and I take exception to the arbitrary act
of the court in the premises."
"Did ,you use the word arbitrary?"
asked the Judge. <*->-'
"Yes, I used the word arbitrary."
"Did you use it advisedly?"
"Yes, I used it advisedly."
"For. the use of that \u25a0 language," said
the Judge sternly, "I adjudge you guilty
of contempt of court and order you to
appear to-morrow morning to show cause
why you should not be punished."
. O'Grady subsided and Newburgh re
marked, "As far as I am concerned I
will not continue in this case. I have
a^motion to present for arrest of Judg
ment, but other counsel will have to ar
gue it."
"The court is not concerned as to what
you do,", retorted the Judge. "If you
have a motion to present, present it." .
Newburgh filed the motion and O'Grady
said he would argue it. The argument
will take' place at 9:30 o'clock this morn
ing.
"Your Honor," replied O'Grady, "went
out of your way, to cast Teflections and
animadversions and to attack counsel for
the defendant. I consider that the re
marks at the end were made In reference
to myself."
Kewburgh should absent himself from
the trial on May SI.
,"1 have -no desire," interrupted the
Judge, "to litigate anything that appears
in a newspaper. Have you anything to
say why Judgment should not be pro
nounced?"
Attorney O*Gradv rose and said he
would take exception to the Judge's rul
lcg. He said there was a suggestion in
a newspaper to the effect that there was
a preconcerted scheme whereby Attorney
O'GRADY I>* CONTEMPT.
Since the cause was first ass&ned to thia
department the court has sought to get all
the aid counsel could give and all available
authorities. Now I hold that to be a proper
relation between court and coumÂ«l. who are
rÂ»orn officers of the court, operating under
a sacred oath and under section 1 252 of the
Cede of Civil Procedure, which It might not
be amiss to read at thia time.
I have made these observations and trust
they will receive proper consideration at the
prcper time, and that the truth of what
occurred will be duly ascertained and an
impartial determination of the facts had, and
If there has been any violation of legal ethics
on the part of counsel here that the matter
ehall be properly inquired into. The motion,
for a new trial is denied.
In closing the Judge said:
Certain matters have developed In the
course of this Inquiry which this court is of
thÂ» view should not pass unnoticed and un
determined, and the court sincerely trusts
that the matter wDI be taken up by the proper
parties and that it will be determined whether
ar. attorney If he does make a statement of
that kind may thereafter come into a court
of Justice, or rather remain out of a court
of Justice 'when a case ls on. and thereafter
appear and urge the violation of his word
at a reason why no particular action should
be taken by a court of justice.
Those are matters that are of every day
importance. This court takes the view that
no man should be permitted to practice law
who ls not worthy of the confidence of the
Jndge who sits upon the bench. The Judge
cf this court follows the uniform practice
that where%-er it can get any light in any
legal matter pending before It it never hesi
tates to ask for that light f rocn counsel on
one side or the other, and the court in j this
Instance did that precise thing â¢ with counsel
fur this defendant, because the. court was then
Impressed and It la now impressed with the
belief that there are many important ques
tions in the case at bar and the -court desired
to be guided right and desired all the aid
it could ret from counsel for the defendant,
and not only In this case but many others.
Judge Lawlor yesterday denied the
motion for a neir trial niade on J*ehalf
of Joseph RebÂ»tock, convicted ot a vio
lation of the election law while an of
ficer of a primary election precinct. At
torney Alexander I* O'Grady was ad
judged guilty of contempt of court for
characterizing the Judge's n/ctlons as
arbitrary* and the defendant* other at
torney, A. S. >*ewburch, grave notice of
his withdrawal from the case. Sen
tence npon the defendant wan not pro
nounced, m* a motion for arrest of
judgment was made nnd will be argrned
this morning. The 'Judge also took oc
â¢\u25a0aÂ».lon to animadvert in scorching
Innpuace npon the courne adopted by
oonnsel for the defendant \u25a0 and to ex
press the hope that the matter would
be taken up by the proper parties.
Trte Judge, in rendering his decision,
dwelt at length on the various points
advanced by defendant's counsel. Re
garding the plea of immunity because the
defendant had testified before the Grand
Jury the Judge held that there had been
nothing to show that the defendant had
been compelled to testify and without
compulsion he coujd not claim immu
nity. The defendant should at the time
have made the fact known that he was
to testify under compulsion and that the
evidence he would give might tend to In
criminate him.
With regard to the point that the trial
was continued on May 21 without a Judge
or the defendant being present, as re
quired by the rules of the court, the
Judge said that from motives of pro
priety he would not proceed to an analy
sis of the testimony, which must stand
on its merits. The rule was well recog
r.ized that the defendant must be pres
ent, but the court would not assume that
there was any trial on May 31. The
court had full authority, without any ad
missions or stipulations from counsel, to
instruct the clerk to nouiy the jurors
not to come till the following day. It
would have been a proper thing to do and
it would not have interfered in any way
â¢with the trial, "as the case was not reg
ularly called. The stipulation or consent
of counsel was not legally necessary, and
he had refrained from discussing the evi
dence for these reasons.

O'GRADY ADJUDGED
GUILTY OF CONTEMPT
Emmet Barrett, secretary of the
Board of Education, yesterday received
an envelope postmarked "Troy, N. V.,"
which, muclT to his surprise on
opening it, contained $195 in currency
inclosed in two sheets of paper, on one
of which was typewritten the single
word "Restitution." ';-.';
The address on the envelope, also in
typewriting, simply read, "Board of
Hducation, City Hall, San Francisco."
After reporting the matter to the
board, Barrett was instructed to .com
municate with City Attorney Long as :
to what disposition should be made 'of
the money. The letter to Long says: \u0084
The only inference to be drawn as to the
source from which the currency came was as
the typewritten word "Restitution" Indicated,
that It was the ' return offering of one, who,
suffering from the tortures of a self-accusing
and guilty conscience, had defrauded this de
partment in the amount forwarded and had
adopted this method of restitution.
This method is not unknown in Governmental
departments. The amounts so received, as
you are aware, from the offerings of guilty
ones desirous ot restoring illegally gotten goods
or their equivalent In money values are cred
ited to the conscience fund.
Under the law we are compelled to deposit
all moneys collected for the benefit of the de
partment within twenty-four hours with the
Treasurer. The ?195 will be so treated imme
diately. A 6 to Its final disposition we are In
a quandary, and for the legal solution of this
difficulty is the object of this communication.
Have we absolute, unquestioned authority to
say direct as to what account or fund this
money, is to be diverted, or credited, or must
we credit it to our general appropriation for
the maintenance of the department? If the
former power resides wUhin us, and the mat
ter is optional with this board, we would like
to have the amount credited to the account of
the Teachers' Annuity and Retirement Fund
to the end that this worthy public charity,
which has its origin and support In the- School
Department and its object the pensioning of
aged and disabled teachers, may reap the
benefit and the intentions of the anonymous
cne forwarding the money for the purpose of
righting an 1 obvlcug wrong provided with a fit
ting and charitable culmination.

as |to the â¢ reasons that prompted him to
agree to pay ' Fred Holz, office boy of the
Amador Tunnel, Milling and Mining Com
pany, $1000 for services rendered, "should
the f plaintiff \u25a0 win in the suit of Nevills
against Flemmmg." It is the contention
of Flemming's counsel that Holz was
paid this sum to destroy papers in the
case that. would operate against Nevills,
but this Nevills flatly denied ; yesterday.
â¢â¢The truth of the, matter is," said Ne
vills, "that * Holz came to me . and said
that he knew Abraham Halsey, secretary
of the company, had lied in his deposi
tion when he testified that certain papers
did not exist. Holz said that while Hal
sey had burned some of the papers he
knew of 'a package yet remaining unde
stroyed.:As I believed these papers con
tained an offer from me to return the
money, Flemming and his. associates had
invested. I agreed to give the boy the
$1000 should -he get these papers. He
did get : some of them, but this was not
among them. That's all there Is to it."
The defense, notwithstanding Nevills
statement, refuses to abandon its con
tention that the offer to pay Holz was
to obtain his services as a destroyer, not
as a saver, of papers, and it will proceed
under this contention to the end.

Alice : Brown,' a denizen of Bacon place,
displayed to Judge Mogan her frightfully
bruised , and lacerated face, and ! told ' him
that -the ; injuries were Z inflicted by, John
Berrymari, . a 20-year-old, who^ informed
the Court that he recently came ' from
Grass : Valley, and since . arrival in the
city has been /dwelling . at; ,911 .: Illinois
street and; working;. as a boiler-maker.
The. woman said the : assault was abso
lutely unprovoked by â¢ her, , and , the de
fendant's plea was that of drunkenness.
,-,VDo , you know- what , you are; doing
while( you ! are ~ drunk?" Judge . Mogan
asked him. . ; "- ;
"Yes," ; was : the sullen * response. ; : ' '
"You knew, that 'you â¢ were^beating thia
unTbrtunate and helpless creature?" ' \u25a0

the debased fellow. -;\> : a . . ;
?? A 1A 1 surgeon, ; however, ; testified % that ; the
cuts 'on -the woman's 1 ! face \u25a0. must - have
been ; made ' with a sharp . instrument
probably brass \u25a0 knuckles.:; Sentence was
postponed till next Saturday.
Brown had remembered : having sent for
him, the pistol play might ' not : have oc-"
curred. ' '_ So sudden,' however, -was - the
lad's entrance that Mr." Brown's * inflamed
imagination saw ; only an t intruder come
to rob,' maybe to murder. Hence ( the dis
play of firearms.
In reply; to an inquiry from the bench,
Mr. Brown . confessed ; that : since depart
ing from the Hub he has imbibed freely
of ;. strong" waters.' Then the'; case was
continued till to-day.
Chief Census Marshal .Thomas E. At
kinson will in a few days submit to the
Board of Education \ his I report of the
school census; for. the year 1905. From
the! progress made up. to yesterday in
the compilation of * tha â¢ returns of the
"deputy marshals 'lt-" is* looked' upon as
certain that the census will not exceed
98,500 children' of school g age, , that lis
between five and seventeen years. .This
will be an Increase of something like
.1000 j over the census of the - last fiscal
year, |.when ,- it 1 was -.' 97.3 53. v The latter
number, was an increase of 5967 over
that of the-prevlous year. - â¢
"The. small \ increase this -year is due
to ithe â¢ fact that'owing to. the change
in \ the State apportionment law : basing
the school ; revenue on the actual at
tendance of pupils instead of on the
census, as formerly, there was no in
centive to \u25a0\u25a0\u0084 work fora, big increase.
Again it is said that the deputies were
inexperienced in the work, some even
being > considered inefficient, but \ hold
ing- their jobs on account of political
influence. ;; % '\u25a0'\u25a0\u0084.---
The total number; of children: under
the age of seventeen years will \u25a0 ap
proximate 120,000 against 118,324' for
1904. and 111.190 -f0r .'1903. . ,T

the rare courage and presence of mind
displayed . by. Miss Vanda | Peterson,' a
housemaid \at the;residence of W. J.

The Somers family have gone to
spend . the warm season jat San Rafael,'
leaving their town home; in charge of

coachman. , V Miss Peterson " lives | in ' the
house, and the coachman's, sleeping
apartment is \in ": the ' stable adjoining,
the structures being divided by "a 1 wide
courtyard. While the girl was in her
room last Wednesday, evening her at
tention was attracted by ; an unwonted
noise inthe yard, and when she looked
out of window she sawi a , man. trying
to effect an entrance to v the lower floor.
Then it was that she proved- possession
of pluckand readiness "^of resource that
rarely attaches tocher sex." Realizing
that if she screamed f the -cracksman
would flee arid probably elude;, cap
ture, she bethought herself of a plan
that would be more, likely ; to; lead to
his arrest Detaching,' an iron stopper
from a .marble'; washstand she -hurled
it at the window; of Mr.*-, Englehardt's
room, across, the yard,' and -'with such
accuracy â¢of I aim -? as to \ * shatter the
glass." '--- Englchardt, who ! was Just on
point of retiring, rightly; interpreted
the signal; as ) an alarm,- and he rushed
to the-yardwitnsuch 4 promptitude as
to 'prevent â¢; the escape '< of the ;,- (baffled
burglar. While the;, men were grrap
pling the maid raised her: .voice in*
scream, and a policeman, soon relieved
the coachman- ox his ' adversary. .'^ t
\u25a0 A communication, from "William- L s
Thomas, chief I engineer jof the Queen
Alexandra, informed V the' Judge that
Mr. Emanuel was a person of most ex
emplary character, -V while Mr. James
was drunk when he so far forgot his
dignity as to visit the ship's lower
regions in quest of trouble. This epis
tle, combined with Mr. James* inebriety
in. court, compassed the acquittal of
Mr. Emanuel. \ '.; ,
â¢ â¢ V _ â¢* - \u25a0, s: .
contributed to dismissal of his battery
combplaint against Mr. Emanuel. In
deed, so intoxicated was Mr. James that
he wobbled and rolled in the witness
chair even as' the Queen Alexandra
wallows In a head sea, and his speech
was both tnick and incoherent. _
Â«. Sober testimony from both the en
gine-room, and the.foc'sle o- the Queen
Alexandra depicted Mr. Emanuel's fistic
decoration of Mr.' James* countenance
as fully' justified by the provocation.
Indeed it was a most flagrant viola
tion of shipbord eitquette on the part
of Mr. James that brought upon him
the punishment. Mr. Emanuel had
complained at mess of the way in
which the grub was cooked â a thing
that no' seagoing man ; who knows, his
prerogative would neglect to doi re
gardless of the quality of the * viands
served: to him- â and. when Mr. James,
who had superintended the cooking,
heard of the complaint he pronounced
it "nigger imperence," ; : abandoned his
galley and invaded. the furnace roomâ
a thing which no sea cook who knows
his place would condescend to do. Mr.
Emanuel, standing^ strictly upon ; his
rights, reminded Mr. James that he was
trespassing, whereupon Mr. James ap
plied an uncomplimentary epithet -j to
Mr. Emanuel, who promptly retaliated
by planting a clenched fist squarely be
tween Mr. James' eyes. .; .A
It :is estimated that ' after allowing a
reasonable value for the . Mason-street
frontage the price paid was very close to
$6000 a, front foot. â¢ " '
The Schmitz property has-been owned
continuously since 1867 by Dr. John Peter
Schmitz, who recently, .transferred it to
the John Peter ! Schmitz Company, a cor
poration composed of himself and family.
: Two \u25a0 important transactions Involving
the same pieces of property, the latter
of which ; establishes a new record for
realty prices on Market street,^have been
consummated by Thomas Magee & Sons
during the' last "week, the ' second sale
having been ' made yesterday at ', a profit
of* $25,000 tto -the first purchasers. The
transactions also remove from the mar
ket Tone 'of -. the last pieces of realty on
Market street below Sixth known to be
forsale. The .pieces involved give front
ages on Market and Mason streets. They
were bought from their original owners
for $385,000 and resold f or : $410,000.
v; The transactions ,' include the following
sales : , From Josiah "W. . Stanford to - 1. \u25a0
Kahn, Fred H. Beaver and two others,
ot property ion the northwest line of
Market street, 28:6 northeast of Turk
street, northeast 29:3% rront, ; with an
average depth of sixty-two feet, for the
price of $158,0u0. The rental of this prop
erty,, under an old lease, amounts to $323
a month, the lease expiring October next.
The adjoining piece â¢â¢' on ' â¢ the east and
fronting 27:1% on ' Market street, with an
average depth of ninety-six feet, includ
ing ja j large "L," running out to Mason
street, on which the frontage is twenty
five feet and the depth 93:6, connecting
in' the rear with the Market-street lot,
was sold by the John Peter Schmitz Com
pany, a corporation, -, to the same pur
chasers, I. Kahn, Fred H. Beaver -and
others, for $227,000. . These purchasers
thus became the owners of 66:5 . frontage
on | Market street by , an average depth
of seventy-nine feet, with tne connection
mentioned on Mason street, at the price
of $385,000. Within. a weeK after, deposit
was . paid on this sale th& property was
resold yesterday; afternoon, through the
agency of; Thomas Magee & Sons to E.
S. Rowley .of Los Angeles for $410,000.
The Schmitz properties rent for $675 a
month,': under lease which expires : next
September..-; The I improvements in each
case are old, wooden' frame buildings- of
no value to the property.
