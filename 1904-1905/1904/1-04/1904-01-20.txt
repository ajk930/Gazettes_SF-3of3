WASHINGTON. Jan. 19. â There
was a "pure food" catastrophe in the
members' lobby of the House to-day.
Representative Mann of JHinois, who
had charge of the Hepburn pure food
bill on the floor of the House, to-day
fortified himself with numerous sam
ples of pure and adulterated concoc
tions, bottled and canned, which he
arranged on his desk as ocular evi
dence to members for the necessity for
pure food legislation. In bringing
these samples .into the House "he
dropped a bottie of olive oil on the
marble floor of the lobby. Immediate
ly General Bingham of Pennsylvania,
the "father of the House." came along
the corridor and slipped on the spot
where the oil had spread over the
floor. His feet went out from under
him and he fell heavily. The general
was helped to ' his committee-room,
where it was found' he Was not injured.
In the meantime Chairman Cooper of
the Insular Committee endeavored to
navigate the oiled marble with a like
result. Cooper was rescued from his
fall. By that time qfficers of the House
roped off the dangerous spot until the
oil was wiped up.

The family of Archduke Ferdinand
Charles has in the pan made a num
ber of r-lans for his marriage to some
royal p*rsonaR'Â». but these were all fu
tile. The Arch-iukf is now at Prague.
The prof*5Â«or*s daughter is now here.
She is described as being very beau
tiful, with a eraceful and slender fig
ure, and highly educated. She is* 23
years of at*.
Th-? "Archduke's proposal to marry
th** daughter of a commoner caused
the moTe astonishment because it was
eaid h<? f-trnngly opposed the marriage
of his brother. Arrhduk* Francis Fer
dinand, with Cou&teis Ohotek, on at-
ervunt of th<> inequality of their social
positions, and refused to partktr>ate in
his brother's wedding festivities.
The Zeit publishes an interview with
Professor Czuber, who said that on
"December- 27 the Archduke formally
asked for. the hand of his daughter
Berths, to -which HÂ»rr Czuher replied
that hÂ» was without influence in the
matter.
Archduke Ferdinand Charles is the
r^phew of Emperor Francis Joseph and
brother of the hpir presumptive to the
throne. Archduke Francis Ferdinand.
It was announced only to-day that he
Â«"as about to marry the daughter of
Herr Emanuel Czuber, professor of
tnathTnatics at Vienna University.
The "Archduke becarap acquainted with
The rrrf^gg^r's daughter at Prague,
where the Archdukt was commander
of an infantry. brigade.
'Til* Archduke has been prominent in
Viennese society, is very cultured and
is -a clever amateur actor. It was said
that, following his marriage, he would
follow the example of Leopold Wolf
ling, formerly Archduke Leopold of
Tuscany, who married .Mile. Admovieh.
a dancer, and renounce the dignity of
Archduke.
VIENNA. Jan. 19.â It was learned to
night in Trell informed circles that
'Archduk* Ferdinand Charles, owing to
the opposition of Emperor Francis Jo
eÂ«?ph, has given up his project of mar
rying Fraulein Czuber. It is said that
he consulted his brother. Archduke Otto
Francis, who privately approached the
Emperor in the matter. Francis Joseph
refused emphatically to give his con
cent to the marriage. Archduke Fer
dinand Charles finally renounced his
intention of making the professor's
daughter his wife. He will seek to for
frct the affair in foreign travel.
'"Orders were given six months ago
to evacuate Newchwang and Manchu
ria, provided the Chinese would agree
to simple terms; but. owing to the in
trigues of the Japanese Minister with
the Wai Wu Pu . (Chinese Foreign
Board) these orders were counter
manded."
Planchtn declared that the action of
the l*nit(*a States in making a. com
mercial treaty with China without Rus
sia's consent, under the existing cir
cumstances, was unfriendly and undip
lomatic. Russia, he Said, would not
open Mukden and Antung tinder the
present regime nor allow Consuls there.
If Japan wanted Korea. Russia would
not interfere, provided other powers al
lowed "it, and he added:
"Russia did rot ask Japan's consent
to occupy Manchuria: neither was It
necessary for Japan to seek Russia's
permission to establish a protectorate
in Korea."
Planchon concluded by saying that
the United States and other nations
were more interested in the situation
than was Russia. The correspondent
adds that the action of the United
States Government had quite upset
Viceroy AlexiefTs calculations.
The German newspapers this morning
appear to be naving the way to explain
the Russian retreat in the negotiations
with Japan, and in all the capitats of
Europe opinion now inclines to a peace
ful issue in- the Far Eastern situation.
In a dispatch from Tokio th* corre
spondent there of the Daily Mail re
ports that a lengthy conference of the
Japanese Cabinet was held on Tuesday,
and says the Emperor la receiving- th*
Ministers of Finance and Marine and
the naval chiefs. The correspondent
says he has learned that Kurino, Japa
nese Minister in St. Petersburg, has
sent a confidential report, in which he
says that at a secret meeting recently
of the Russian Grand Dukes and the
Ministers War Minister Kuropatkin
and some of his colleagues declared In
favor of peace.
. According to the Tokio correspondent
of the Standard the Privy Council will
be convened to-day to discuss im
portant measures bearing upon the sit
uation. . ..-'
The Port Arthur correspondent of the
Daily Mail declares in a dispatch that
eleven Russian battalions of infantry,
togther with cavalry and artillery, have
been dispatched to the Yalu River. He
mentioned also an unconfirmed report
that Japan has landed troops m South

LONDON, Jan. 20.â The Port Arthur
correspondent of the T^aily Mail cables
that he had an interview with Admiral
Alexieff. the Russian Viceroy in the
Far East, who spoke hopefully of the
possibility of arranging a modus vl
vendi with Japan. The Viceroy then
referred the correspondent to his dip

sized the impossibility of Russia's evac

"I do not know as to that. If there

CINCINNATI, Jan. 13.â Senator Fot

George B. Cox's announcement of his
candidacy for delegate at large from
Ohio to the Chicago convention, said:
"Yes. I read about that in the news

his privilege to seek any recc-shition he
may wish the party to give him."
"Do you think he will have any op
position?"
General Caceres of thr Morales forces
entered the city yesterday with 250
men. He left to-night with'TOO men. to
attack Santiago de los Caballeros. This
battle will be the most important of
the Jiminez revolution. The rebels,
firmly intrenched in their capital, will
make desperate resistance.
General Deschamps on January 15 re
ceived a. letter from General Jiminez in
which the latter stated that he realized
his <-ase was hopeless, but that he must
make a supreme effort-
The presence of foreign warships pre
vented disorder, and the American
commander practically managed the
battle.
All towns between Puerta Plata and
Santiago, the latter place being the
headquarters of the Jiminez revolution,
are reported to favor the Morales gov
ernment.
SAN* JUAN, P. R., Jan. 19.-San Do

source which have reached here are to
the effect that Germany Is quietly-buy

against San Domingo, with, the inten

to enforce their payment! These claims
ante-date those of the American com
pany and aggregate $3,000,000.
PUERJA-PLATA. San Domingo. Jan.
13. â In the recapture of Puerta Plata
by the Government forces the fighting
zone marked off by the commanders of
the United States and British warships
was accepted by the contending forces.
President Morales' troops promptly re
spected the order to cease firing, al
though General Jiminez's forces when
routed ran through the streets and con
tinued to fire in all directions.
The Government forces followed in
pursuit of the rebels, but advanced in
pood order and finally drove General
Xteschamps, the Vice . .President under,
the Wos y Gil administration and now
support^of Jiminez, to the fart- - - :""
An.Airarican force composed of eight
men, with the stars and stripes, went
to Ihe firing line and demanded a sus
pension of hostilities. The commander
of the United States warship then land
ed a force of 100 men and arranged for
the surrender of the fort. The Ameri
cans disarmed the Jiminez forces and
later turned over the fort to General
Cespedes, in command of the Govern

Indians Getting Civilized.

last .chief of the Creek Indian nation,
is a sufferer from that highly .civilized
disease known as gout.* "If I had stuck
to the life of my youth," he â¢says, "I
should not be a sufferer from any such
trouble." 'I used to live .out of doors,*
sleep, on the ground and eat plain food.
Then I was healthy. Oh, but this gout
hurts. It Just compels you tp swear. A

EXPERT GUNNERS IN DEMAND.
Pay Offered by Japan Induces De
sertions From British Warships.
The officers of the Japanese liner
America Maru say that the tempting
pay ofTered by the Japanese Govern

ble for reducing the gun crews* on
nearly every British warship in j Asi
atic waters and that side by side with'
England's runaway marksmen will be
found not a- few who should be be
hind the guns of Uncle Sam's ships.
The pay offered ranges, according to
the skill of the gunner and the danger
of his probable station in the event
of war. from an amount that might
tempt an impecunious subaltern to as
high as $500 a month. . The number
of desertions from British vessels is

Baron von Richthofen, the Secretary
for Foreign Affairs, answering Herr

over Russian anarchists in Germany,
but the Government was not aware
that German subjects were likewise un
der observation. The Government also
Â¦was not aware that Russian agents had
committed crimes or attempted to per
suade others to commit crimes. The
Chancellor, continued the Foreign Sec
retary, did not intend to interfere be
cause he regarded it as advisablfe that
foreign anarchists should be- observed
by agents of their own country.
Baron von Richthofen further said
that the Russian Government main
tained a similar bureau in Paris, and
the Italian* Government had one in
London. The Socialist press, the Sec
retary asserted, had become the organ
of the Russian anarchists..'- :
Herr Haase then asked the Ministers
If It were not true that Russians were
conducted across the German frontier
at the request of the Russian Govern
ment, without extradition proceedings
or the bringing of specific charges.
The principle laid down by the Ger
man Government, the Deputy added,
seemed to be that a Russian residing in
Germany who was obnoxious to his own
Government thereby immediately be
came an undesirable resident, and, in-
Ftead of being allowed to cross any
frontier he pleased, he was put across

CHICAGO, Jan. 19.â The City Council
to-night took action that will in all
probability result in the closing of
nearly all ' of the theaters in Chicago
for the remainder. of the present, the
atrical season. Last night 'the Council
passed an ordinance setting forth, what,
must be done by the theaters of this
city before they will be allowed to re
main in continuous operation. It con
vened to-night to consider the passage
of an enabling act that would allow* the
theaters to operate for the. remainder"
of this season without being compelled
to fulfill all the requirements . of the
ordinance, as some of the conditions
are of a nature that will require the
practical reconstruction pf a number of
the playhouses. After a long debate the
Council decided on the following essen
tials which the theaters must meet be
fore they will be allowed to reopen
their doors: .
A steel curtain: an automatic sprinkler sys
tem; a bond of $25,000 guaranteeing the per
formance, by August 1. 1904, of all the re
quirements of the ordinance; the widening of
doors and exits. All of the above- to be
performed under such conditions, terms and
restrictions as shall be Imposed by the Mayor
of the city, the Commissioner of Buildings
and a sub-committee of three to be ap
pointed by the Mayor.
The managers of theaters declared to
night tljat it would be impossible for
them to meet the demands of the enab
ling act in sufficient time to do busi
ness during the remainder of this sea
son and several of them declared they
had no intention of trying to reopen
their doors.
The municipal placer mine in the'

thousands and thousands of cures they

increase of their sales fully attest the

properties that .the gastric juices and
other digestive fluids of the stomach
possess : and they actually" do the diges-
tive \fork of the stomach and enable
.that organ to rest and recuperate and
-become sound : and well, j They act in
a mild, natural manner and cause no
disturbance in - the digestive organs.
They prevent, any fermentation of. th.e

"What the United States Has Done
for International Arbitration." He
said:
By its steady championship of a freer com
merce and of most elevated principles of con
duct in war, the United States has brought
about an almost complete change in the prac
tice of nations. There still demands to be in
corporated Into international law one of the
principles announced by the founders of our
Government and steadily advocated up to this
day â the exemption from seizure of private
property on the sea in time of war. President
Roosevelt, reiterating the words of his illus
trious predecessor in his last annual message,
has again urged it Upon the nations of the
world, and the day is, I think, not far distant
when it will be accepted by them.
AÂ« our country from its earliest history led
the nations of the earth in creating a more
elevated and Â¦ perfect system of international
law, so also it has been the most active in ad
justing' international controversies and preserv
ing: peace by means of treaties of arbitration.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19. â The trial
of August W. Machen and the others
indicted with him for conspiracy to
defraud the Government proceeded
rapidly to-day. The Government pre

ments having a direct bearing on the
dealings of the Groff brothers with
Machen's division in the Postofflce De
partment and bank officials gave tes
timony concerning the deposits of the
Groffs and the checks drawn against
these deposits.
The fact was brought out by two
witnesses representing firms which
manufactured the Groff fastener that
the price to the Groffs of the complete
fastener was 25 cents, with a rebate of
5 cents on, each fastenar conditioned on
prompt settlement of bills. The price
at which the fasteners were supplied
to the Government at first was fixed
at $1 50 each, but later it was reduced
to $1 25 each.

NEW YORK, Jan. 19. â Cured of a
broken neck, James Dunn, 17 years
old, has been discharged from a hos
pital, where he had spent five motion
less months, rigid in a plaster cast and
with heavy weights at his head and
feet which; held his body immo^ble.
The operation and cure have at
tracted great attention among sur
geons. Dunn was injured by diving
from a pier while bathing. Three ver
tebrae were crushed and chipped. He
was kept alive with great difflculty
during the operation. The splintered
bone was removed and the fractures
set.,Then the whole of the upper body,
neck and head were placed in a plaster

Dunn was laid upon a table and
heavy weights attached to his head

meant death or permanent helpless
ness for him and he became the most
patient person imaginable. The bones
knitted perfectly and when the cast
was removed the boy was found to be
as sound as ever.

their homes.
Similar ceremonies were observed
throughout Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 19.â The
Czar made his public appearance this
season at to-day's solemn ceremony of
blessing the waters. In the orthodox
church this rite Is commemorative of
the baptism of the Savior. It took place
in an open chapel built out on a quay
extending far from the Winter Palace.
It was preceded by a religious service
within the palace, which was attended
by the imperial family with the excep
tion of the Czarina, whose condition
was such as to prevent her being pres
ent, and the court officials, nobility and
representatives of the foreign powers.
The latter drove to tlye palace in great
Etate. with outriders wearing tradi
tional hunting knives, belts, caps and
streaming plumes of the national col
ors.
The scene outside the chapel was ex
tremely impressive. The thermometer
registered below zero and the atmos
phere was clear. Along the quay the
people were held back by a troop of
mounted gendarmes. The bareheaded
procession moved through double lines
of imperial infantry and a sailor guard
from the palace to the chapel, with the
cross and gospel held aloft, preceded by
the Metropolitan and the higher clergy
in gold-embroidered vestments, with
church banners, and followed by the
6carlet-gowned court choir, the cham
t>erlains and other court officials. Then
came the officers of crack regiments
without their overcoats, thus permit
ting a gorgeous display of uniforms,
bearing the flags of the empire. Next
was the magnificent Chevalier Guard,
in white tunics, with gold cuirasses
and double-eagled helmets; Hussars
and Red Lancers, with sable-tipped
headgear and crimson facings.
The Grand Dukes immediately pre
ceded the Czar, who carried himself
easily. He wore a simple uniform, that
of the famous Preobrajensky regiment,
the cross of St. Andrew glittering on
his breast. This was his only decora
tion. The Czar, who held his helmet in
his hand, looked strong and well. A
rocket screaaing up from the middle of
the river signaled his Majesty's appear
ance, which was greeted with a salvo
of artillf ry of 101 guns from the fortress
Saints Peter and Paul, punctuated with
the simultaneous chiming of bells
throughout the city. When the Czar
5iad taken utÂ» his position in the chapel
and the ice below had been broken the
Metropolitan blessed the shadowy
Â¦waters and the cross was dipped thrice
therein.
The groom is well known in society
and club life here. He is very rich,
having inherited the . fortune of his
father, a pioneer wallpaper manufac
turer of the country.
The story of Mrs. Plant's fight in
the courts for her dower rights in the
will that she contested and won is well
known, [it will be remembered that
Plant, desiring that his enormous for
tune, estimated at mere than $20,000,000,
should become the greatest in the
world, provided that the entire estate
should remain undivided until the
youngest unborn son of his grandson
(the latter then only j four years old)
should reach his majority. An annuity
of $20,000 each was set aside for the
widow and only son, Morton F. Plant.
Plant drew up this provision of his
will under the direction of shrewd law
yers, but a legal -flaw was found and
the instrument was broken. The ground
upon which the will was set aside was
that Plant's seven years' residence in
Connecticut did not establish a bona
fide citizenship in that State, the laws
of which permit the entailing of prop
erty. He was declared to have been
a resident of New York, where the
laws forbid entailing, and the property
was divided under the statutes of this
State.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â Robert Graves
and Mrs. M. J. Plant, widow of Henry
B. Plant, millionaire Southern railroad,
steamship and land owner, have been
married at the Plant residence on Fifth
avenue. There were only a half dozen
witnesses, all relatives of the bride and
bridegroom. A small luncheon was
served, and 'then Mr. and Mrs. Graves
departed in a special car for a short
trip. Every effort was made to pre
vent any publicity, and some of the
nearest relatives of both were in com
plete ignorance of the affair until they
were notified by telephone or telegraph.
LONDON. Jan. 19. â There was a
considerable crush irTcourt and a buzz
of anticipation when Whitaker
Wright, the company promoter, on
trial on the charge of fraud, entered
the witness box to-day. The former
-financier was composed and answered
questions firmly. He first related the
story of his life in America and then
told of the foundation of the London
and Globe Corporation, which, he de
clared, was prosperous until the end
of 1899, after the South African war
had started, when matters became
disastrous. The witness added that
he assisted the company out of his
private pocket, advancing between
$2,000,000 and $2,500,000. Previous
to this he had prepared a settlement
of $1,500,000 on his family, giving
$500,000 to each of his children, but
one day in 1899 the company's ac
countant informed him that he must
have SI, 500,000 or the company
would be obliged to suspend. The
witness said he supplied the money
and consequently the settlement on
his family was never carried out.
Wright admitted that he only held
2500 shares of the London and Globe
Corporation at the time of the crash
and said he tried to induce the late
Lord Dufferin to resign his director
ship because the newspapers attacked
him over Lord. Dufferin's shoulders.
The witness had intimated to Lord
Dufferin that the position of chairman
of a speculative company was not
dignified, but Lord Dufferin replied
that he was well satisfied and that he
wished to retain the position.
â¢Wright was cross-examined con
cerning his departure* for the United
States. He said that at the time he
felt justified in leaving, in view of
what had been said in Parliament.
He admitted that while managing di
rector of one company he' would sell
to himself as managing director of
another.
' Questioned on the subject of vari
ous items in the balance sheet of 1899,
he asserted that the sheet was
"straight as a die." He would never
admit anything wrong therewith.
"Profiting by the experience gained
when the finest jewel the British em
pire ever possessed, the United States,
left us for a separate existence." he
continued, "a new empire has arisen,
greater than any in the world, but the
great work of keeping and making per
manent this inheritance remains to be
solved. In the great revolution whioh
separated the United States from Great
Britain the greatest man that the revo
lution recognized, in my Judgment, was
Alexander Hamilton, the soldier-states
man. He left a precious legacy to his
countrymen when he said to them:
'Learn to think. Think continently.'
"I venture now to give you a similar
message. Learn to think imperially
and remember that the future of this
country lies in the future of the British
race in our colonies and possessions "
Although no vote of confidence was
permitted, the extraordinary enthusi
asm of the Stock Exchange, which es
corted Mr. chamberlain's carriage to
the Guildhall, the cheers which punctu
ated his speech and the vociferous ap
plause at the close of his remarks must
have assured the former Colonial Sec
retary that he had the full sympathy of
his audience.
Almost simultaneously with Cham
berlain's exposition of his policy in
the Guildhall the Duke of Devonshire
and Lord George Hamilton addressed
at Liverpool an equally enthusiastic, if
smaller, meeting, which was held un
der the auspices of the Unionist. Free
Food League. The Duke of Devon
shire said he was coming more and
more to believe that the. Government
was right in advocating a policy of
retaliation against protectionist coun
tries, but with Premier Balfour al
lowing himself t6 be so dragged into
the Chamberlain propaganda it would
be impossible for the Unionists to
maintain their alignment with the
Government before the country If it
was desired to differentiate between
retaliation and protection. When he
justified the Government's position
before the House of Lords, the speaker
continued, ho believed there would be
a real inquiry into the trade condi
tions of the United Kingdom, and he
had not then thought that this inquiry
would be limited to the production of
an undigested mass of statistics
coupled with an academical treatise
by the Premier.
The meeting passed a resolution
declaring against a general- protective
system.
Chamberlain, in an eloquent perora
tion, pointed out that the struggle for
life and existence in the future would
not be between the cities of kingdoms,
but between mighty empires. The min
or states would come off badly.
LONDON. Jan. 19.âThe Guildhall
was packed to suffocation to-day by
a throng gathered to hear Joseph
Chamberlain speak. Chamberlain, who
was accompanied by his wife, received
a great ovation. He oegan by declar
ing that the provincial centers of com
merce of the United Kingdom had been
heard from in regard to his tariff pro
posals, but the views of the citizens of
London were not yet known. He de
sired to ascertain how the city men
felt on the subject of Me scheme be
fore the op2ning of Parliament, but he
regretted that owing to its non-politi
cal character the meeting wo-uld not
have the opportunity of voting directly
for or against him.

The annual meeting of the- San Fran
cisco Polyclinic was held yesterday aft
ernoon at its building, 430 Ellis street.
This Institution is one of the commend
able establishments supported and
maintained by the generosity and phil
anthropy of public spirited ladies. Mrs.
M. H. de toung, its original founder,
has had the proud satisfaction of seeing
it grow into one of the most useful in
stitutions in the city. Quartered first in
two small rooms, the Polyclinic has
grown until the entire building on Ellis
street has been found to be too small
for its use.
The Polyclinic is a post-graduate ad
junct of the medical department of the
University of California.
The worthy efforts of Mrs. de Young
have been seconded by Mrs. Phebe A.
Hearst, who has contributed toward
the maintenance of the Polyclinic.
In addition to its usefulness in the
center of the city there is a ward set
aside in the City and County Hospital
for the physicians connected with the
Polyclinic. It is the aim of these doc
tors to keep this ward as near the re
quired standard of perfection as possi
ble considering the condition and sur
roundings of the somewhat ancient
structure.
Officers were elected as follows: Of
fice boardâ Dr. J. Wilson Shiels, presi
dent: Dr. Leo Newmark, first vice pres
ident; Dr. "W. E. Martin, second vice
president; Dr. Louis Bazet, treasurer;
Dr. Martin Regensburger. secretary.
Board of general directorsâ Dr. George
F. Shiels, Dr. George Merritt and Dr.
Henry Wagner.
These gentlemen will if they can ob
tain sufficient funds to make needed
improvements in the building and
equipage of the Polyclinic during the
year. It is their intention to add an
other story to the structure^ which will
be fitted up with the latest modern ap
pliances known to the profession.

CHICAGO, Jan. 19.â An alleged at
tempt by a member of the Nash family
to bribe James Tilbery to fiee from the
country, the return of a true bill
against the prisoner by the Grand Jury
and the discovery of evidence.pertain
ing to the existence of a secret society
said to be for blackmailing purposes
among Chicago coachmen were the
chief developments of to-day in the
proceedings instituted by Mrs. Hollis
M. Thurston against her former chauf
feur. * . i
Tilbery is now held under a formal
indictment charging him with attempt
ing to extort money by threats from
Mrs. Thufston. S
The statement* that an agent of the
Nash family had offered to pay Til
bery's bond of $2200 and give him $500
on condition that he would "skip" to
England was made by Emmet
Clare, Tilbery's attorney. Mrs. Thurs
ton's attorney emphatically denies this
charge, and sa'ys his client will appear
on the witness stand against Tilbery.
The investigation has . revealed , thej
existence of "The Thirteen-Tnch Gurr
Club',' among coachmen, membership
of .whlch-.is. strictly confined, to private
family .coachmen;, to the exclusion ot
â¢"Jehus!" It 'appears .that .'Tilbery is

VALLEJO, Jan. 19.â The first d<Â»
rennial report of the Sailors* Union,
Â«>f which the- Rev. Theodore P. Burn
ham. M. A., is superintendent, has
bren issued and contains an interest-
Ing review of the good work done dur
ing ten years for the enlisted men in
the navy. The report says in part:
Special Dlrpiteh to The Call
In the event of the Court of Cassa
tion deciding that a further Investiga
tion is necessary the case will come
before the three chambers of the Su
preme Court, sitting together, which
will decide whether to refer the case
to a court-martial or pass final judg
ment upon It Should an Investigation
be ordered the proceedings probably
will last six months.
PARIS, Jan. 19. â The report of At
torney General Baudern is favorable
to Dreyfua, following the view adopt
ed by the court, which recommended
a revision of the case. The Attorney
General to-day finished the examina
tion of the case before the Court of
Cassation. The decision of the court,
which is not expected for some weeks,
undoubtedly will be in favor of Drey
fus. /
SAN BERNARDINO. Jan. -9.â De
spite weather predictions ,to the con
trary, rain began falling hc.e at noon
to-day and continued ' x showers dur
ing the afternoon and e-enlng. The
total precipitation was about .15 of an
inch, but conditions continue favorable
for additional rain.
SAN Ll'lS OBISPO. Jan. 19.â Rain
fell again last night and it was showery
to-day. Wind southwesterly. with
every indication of heavy downpour.
Business of every kind is improving.
RIVERSIDE, Jan. 19.â Rain began
falling here at noon to-day and contin
ued in a drizzle all afternoon. The
barometer is rising to-night and the in
dications are that the rain will not
amount to much. The rainfall to date
has been .64 of an inch.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 19.â Heavy showers
about midnight make the .ainfall of
the storm nearly an inch. Sunday
forenoon .67 of an inch fell. This makes
nearly four inches for the season. This
last storm is worth thousands of dol
lars to the county. It will enable
farmers to seed their plowed land and
bring up the grain already in the
ground. On the cattle ranges grass
was getting very low. but this last
storm will start the feed again. > The
rain has put the orchards in fine condi
tion to be worked. A late season gen
erally means a pood fruit crop, as a
late opening of the buds and blossoms
are generally not touched by frost.
Santa Clara Valley will be able to get
along without rain now for several
week-?. Indications are, however, that
the : torm is not over.'. More snow fell
l_st night on the Mount Hamittbn
range and that range is well covered
with snmv.
Having received special warning from
the Weather Bureau hundreds of ranch
ers resorted to smudging this morning
and thereby removed all danger to
their crops. It takes more than one
frosty morning to injure a crop which
hats so far advanced and unless the
cold weather continues and the tem
ptrature falls many degrees below
what It was this morning practically
no damage can result when ordinary
precautions are taken to prevent It.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 19.â A downpour of
rain began at 3 o'clock this afternoon.
The wind Is fmni the rain quarter and
a good fall is indicated.
SANTA ANA. Jan. 19.â Rain com
menced falling here at noon to-day in
a steady downpour. The weather con
ditions give promise of u continuance.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19.â Reports to
night from correspondents stationed
throughout the orange district 6f
Southern California are to the effect
that the- frost this morning did little
damage to the citrus crop. It was a
(sharp freeze in places, but was not suf
ficient to seriously injure^the crop,
which is now practically ready for mar
ket.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Speaker Cannon regretted that such
a small . percentage of the merchant
marine carried the American flag. He
predicted this country would gradually
gain control of all the stocks In our
transportation lines, both rail and
steam, now owned in foreign countries.
He announced there would be no legis
lation in this session of Congress bear
ing on great commercial questions ow
ing to the proximity of the Presiden
tial campaign.
The Panama canal, the greatest work ever
undertaken In the world, has fallen to the
United States to do. Is It for military uses?
For the people along- the shore? It will be of
little use unless we have a merchant marine.
With our great natural resources, great en
dowments, great cosmopolitan people ' full of
enterprise, time will not wait. Progress is
the word. We should not be satisfied until we
regain the supremacy we had In, the days of
wooden shipbuilding.
In the Interests of the working people rather
more than any other we ought to have a mer
chant marine. There la the place where we,
as a great party, have neglected our duty.
We are spending millions for a navy and
neglecting a very necessary attribute. It is
Important for us . to follow the experience of
other maritime nations, who. in time of war,
found it necessary to have an auxiliary fleet.
Are we to permit two hundred millions of dol
lars to bo into the pockets of foreign ship
owners when at least a part of that should be
retained at home?
"WASHINGTON, Jan. â¢ 19.â At the
banquet of the National Board of Trade
to-nijght Senator Hanna discussed the
ship subsidy bill. He said in part:
UKIAH, Jan. 19.â Pete Lamar, an In
dian, was found murdered this morn
ing. Investigation showed that he had
t:en in town with several other In
dians. The redskins filled themselves
with claret and. then retired to the
cabin of Jeff Dick. It is supposed that
a drunken row occurred tljei :. . *
Lamar's body, was found half a mile
from where a pool of blood showed
that the tragedy had occurred. . T,he
assailants had . tied a handkerchief
around Lamar's throat and then
pounded his head with stones. Tracks
from the scene of the murder' seem to
indicate 'that three men and one squaw
carried the body to where it was found.
Sheriff Smith has made four arrests.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 19.â The estate
of Miser Charles Hill, which has been
the bone of contention for hundreds
of alleged heirs and for which more
than a dozen widows have entered
their claims, was distributed to-day by
order of court, the- entire estate,
amounting to $144,000, going to heirs
in Boston. tfSn
The names of the fortunate claim
ants are: Salem D. Charles, Helen A.
Bliss, Mrs. Leonard A. Hyde, Byron W.
Charles, Fred A. Charles, Jennie E.
Skerry, Mrs. Mary L. Charles and Mrs.
Sarah F. C. Barrett. The State re
ceived over $5000 out of the estate as
the inheritance tax. t
Sheriff White left to-day for the Te
hachapi Pass to assist in the search for
the fugitive. A reward of $50 has been
offered for his apprehension.
Parker was being taken to the peni
tentiary by Deputy Sheriff Cleveland,
and the officer permitted him to go to
the lavatory. He remained for some
time, and Cleveland went to .the end of
the car Just as Parker was climbing
out of a window. 1 The officer promptly
opened fire on him at close range, but
it is not known whether he struck him.
Cleveland also jumped off the train; but
Parker Jumped down an embankment
and escaped in the darkness through a
deep canyon.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19.â Echv'ard
Parker, a professional crook, under sen
tence at the Folsom penitentiary, for
grand larceny, leaped' from ; a north
bound Southern Pacific train in the
Tehachapi Mountains early this morn
ing, and despite the fact tViat he was
handcuffed made his escape. '

DOVER, Del., Jan. â.âThe Newcas
tle Presbytery decided to-day to try
Rev. R. A. Elwood of "Wilmington,
Del., on charges in connection with the
preaching of a sermon by him last June
en. .tied "Should the Murderer of Helen
Bishop* Be Lynched?" The trial will
take place in the Presbyterian church
at Newcastle on- February 2.
The complaint against" Mr. Elwood is
t" the sermon so aroused the popu
lace that- the next night a mob gath
ered, stormed the Workhouse, took out
George White, a negro, who confessed
to having brutally murdered beautiful
Helen-Bishop, and burned him to' death
at the stake.
' LONDON', Jan. 19.â At the annual
dinner to-night of the Canada Club, at
which Lord Strathcona* presided and
whore the guests included Sir James
Ritchie, Lord Maytfr of London; Lords
Duncannon, Hillingdon and Litchfield.
Sir Rivers Wilson and others. Colonial
Secretary Lyttelton -ruffled the feelings
of the Canadians present by uphording
in a speech, Lord Chief Justice Alver
stone's. recent ruling in the Alaska
boundary case. . .
The Duke- erf Marrborough.; Under
Secretary "of State for the Colonies,
spoke a little later, arid succeeded in
restoring a better feeling. He recalled
his visit. to Canada,- paid a tribute to
the Canadians for ' the' love of -the late
Queen Victoria and mentioned his per
sonal experiences,^ in South Africa,
where, he said, he. witnessed the brav
ery and respurcef ulness of the Cana
dian troops.
Colonial Secretary's Reference
to Alaskan Boundary De
cision Has Disturbing Effect
This is an eloquent expose of the dis
tinction between law as a science and
law us a practice. It would appear to
many observers after a visit to our
courts of to-day that our Jurists are
spending more time over the practice
than the science of law, and hence that
much of the moral grandeur and intel
lectual harmony of the latter is lost.
Should we not be careful not to degrade
the practice of law into a "mere art of
casuistry, and chicanery," which our
lawyers elaborate, as Blackstone says,
"With a skill the most amazingly arti
ficial, but -which serves no other pur

practice of Law.
In Cicero's "Treatise on the Laws"
Marcus is asked by Atticus hi3 opin
ion respecting the nature of law, and
part of the answer is as follows: "We
have had many great men in Rome,
who have made it their profession to
expound it to the people, and explain
its doctrines "and practice. But
though they professed to be acquaint
ed with its majestic theory, they were
rather familiar with its minute .tech
nicalities. What can be grander or
nobler than jurisprudence? or what
can be more insignificant or quibbling
that the practice of lawyers? â nec
essary as it is for, the people. Xot
that I think that those Wjho adopt this
profession are- altogether ignorant of
the principles of universal legislation;
but they are fat more attentive to civ
il law, which gives them a hold on the
interest of people. Are then the sub
lime and recondite principles of ju
risprudence less necessary or less "use
ful?
Certainly not. â¢ â¢ â¢ You ask me
not to write treatises on the rights of
common sewers and partition walls
(stillicidlorum ac parietum), and to
compose forms . of stipulations and
judgments. . These have been already
most ' diligently prepared by clerks in
office, and are decidedly lower than the
topics which you expect me to discuss."

It seems that the hippopotamus is to
be exterminated. It is hardly probable
that the hippopotamus will enjoy this,
but it will be a good thins for man
kind, accordins to the London Globe.
The Intelligent constantly " attacks
boats, fields and gardens, and :" what
he does not eat," says an authority, "he
sits on." Xow he is himself to be sat
on. , "We trust that those In charge of
Extinction of the Hippopotamus
the campaign will remember the ad
vice of one of our foremost naturalists,
and "shoot the hippopotamus with bul
lets made of platinum." For if they
use the other kind his hide will surely
flatten 'em. â New York Tribune.
An the general dismissed his men
and would not go until next morning
after his cafe au lit. Of course, whfcn he
reached his destination the liberals had
flown and he was deprixed of his glo
rious victory by a miserable spoonful
of milk. â Chicago Inter Ocean.
Perez had not been a general long,
but he wanted milk in his coffee,
weheras nine Colombians out of ten are
content with black coffee. There was
no milk. The cows are kept three or
four hours' Journey out of town, and,
of course, milk cannot be kept over
night in that tropical climate. The ho
tel folk figured that the milk could not
arrive before* 11 o'clock.
The general fumed and fretted. Some
of his officers suggested that he had
better start without the milk or the
enemy would escape, but he said it was
impossible to fight on black coffee. He
sent a soldier post haste to fetch the
milk and then another after him to
hurry him up. Meanwhile the army
stood in the broling sun for hours,
awaiting the order to march. It was
nearly noon when the messengers re
returned.
"No milk," they reported.
"Caramba! Then I won't march till
to-morrow." - '
The troops were lined up at that hour
outside the hotel and the general
strutted to and fro, waiting for his
coffee and telling everybody what ter
rible things he was going to do to the
enemy. But a complication arose.
The latest revolution in Colombia had
many farcical features. ; One of the fun
niest of these was the incident of the
general who would not fight without
his milk.. General Perez was In com
mand of the Government troops at Call.
One day news arrived that the Liberals
had captured a neighboring town. Perez
was ordered to start with his army at
7 o'clock n*xt morning to attack them.
He went to the barracks, made a patri
otic speech to the soldiersand told them
to parade at the appointed hour. Then
he sauntered into the Hotel America,
Cali's finest restaurant, and ordered
coffee for 6:30 in the morning.

THE HUMOROUS SIDE
OF A REVOLUTION*
Blair was dismissed by former Com
missioner Folks, but the Court of Ap
peals decided that inasmuch as he was
e veteran the dismissal was illegal. He
took office again under the McClellan
administration.
The bill further alleges that Blair,
on getting this amount, failed to live
up to the stipulation and that Walms
ley, who was formerly a merchant of
San Francisco, is now a pauper in Cin
cinnati, having been sent there by
Blair.
j NEW YORK, Jan. 19. â Suit for res
titution of property was brought to
day against George Blair, superintend-
I ent of the Bureau of Dep'endent Adults
I of the -Department of Charities. In a
j bill of equity filled to-day in the United
States Circuit Court it is alleged that
j Blair while superintendent, prior to his
j dismissal some months ago by former
' Commissioner Homer Folks, secured
I the transfer of cash and property
amounting to about $25,000 from Rob
ert Walmsley, an aged and mentally ir
responsible man, to him, with an un
derstanding that Blair should provide
for Walmsley for the remainder of his
life.
"I know that Blaise was with him,
for I recognized his'picture which was
shown me after he was dead. I have
a very good memory of faces. Blaise
seemed to be frightened at the actions
of Soeder and did not utter a word.
He had come into- the hall before with
Soeder, but never boucht a drink. I
never saw him dfsplay any money and
do not believe the poor fellow had a
cent."
"Spot," with whom Soedcr used to
go, was found in the Cascade saloon
and dance hall at 513 Pacific street. She
said her name was Maria McDonald,
and she professed not to remember Soe
der.
The poiice are still working along the
lines that a conspiracy existed between
Solder and others to kill Blaise after
they had taken out all the insurance
on his life that they, were able. Chief
Wittman has received more telegrams
and cablegrams from insurance com
panies in the East and Europe.' These
mpFsages tell of the existence of an in
surance swindling ring in this city.
"About a week before the murder
Soeder, Blaise and another man came
into the dance hall. They got three of
the girls and proceeded to order drinks.
They had been here but a few minutes
when Soeder wanted the girls to go
out with them. "When I refused to al
low this he became very angry and used
the vilest language. I ordered him out
of the house apd as he backed up the
stairs I followed him to see that he
left. "While he was on the stairs he
I drew a gun and pointing it at me said
â¢I've a good mind to kill you.' I ran
back into the dance hall and grot a
couple of men. When they went out to
got Soeder he was gone, i did not com
plain to the' police because the drawing
cf a gun is of frequent occurrence
here.
"That was the last I saw of Soeder."
BLAISE HAD XO MOXEY.
SoÂ«der was 'well known among the
people who infest the low dives, dance
halls and saloons along Barbary Coast.
I Kate Edington, known as "Spanish
} Kitty," proprietress of tne Strassburg
' dance hail, at 901Vi Kearny street, has
! known Soeder for fourteen years. She
I told yesterday of his pulling a revolver
on her in her dance hall about a week
before the murder oÂ£ Blaise was com
mitted.
"I know the man Â¦well and immedi
i ately recognized him by the pictures
published in the Â¦papers." she said. "I
have known him for fourteen years.
He used to go with a woman whom the
girls in the dance halls knew by the
name of 'Spot.' He was always to, be
found around the saloons and halls In
this part of town.
The men did not see Salomon, but
left word with his clerk that they would
return in the morning and tell their
story. The men are believed to be
Joseph Rose and Thomas Thompson,
whom Alexander Campbell, who Is act
ing with Salomon for Soeder, has been
defending in the Police Court. Yester
day their cases, the nature of which
is not known, came up for hearing in
Judge Cabaniss' court and a contin
uance was granted for ten days at the
request of CampbelL The continuance
papers merely stated that for good and
sufficient reasons the case would go
over. The papers were signed by John
Greif. County Clerk.
Campbell made the statement that
Rose and Thompson were needed for
the defense in the Soeder hearing,
which comes off a week from to-day.
It is believed that the attorneys ex
pect to disprove by Rose and Thomp
son some of the evidence that has been
gathered against Soeder Dy the police.
KXO\VX IX THE DIVES.
Soeder's friends have already begun
to form his line of defense. Yesterday
evening two men called at the office of
Attorney Salomon, in the Parrott build
ing, and said they would be ready when
the time came to swear that Soeder was
elsewhere than in the neighborhood in
which the crime was committed at the
time that Blaise is supposed to have
been killed.
The King woman has not yet been
brought face to face with Soeder, and
says that she never knew him by that
name. None of the girls knew him as
Soeder. Teresa King introduced Can
non to Soeder at the latter's request for
some one to do something for him.
ALIBI BOBBIXG UP.
.Two new witnesses were discovered
yesterday by the police. They are girls
employed In the O. K. saloon dance
halL One is named Rosa Kirk and, the
other goes by the name of Elsia. Both
when shown the picture of Soeder posi
tively verified the statement made by
Teresa King that Soeder was In the sa
loon drinking "with her an hour after
the time the murder is supposed to
have been committed.
The first identification of Soeder that
has been made was obtained yesterday
from Frank Cannon, the man Soeder
wanted to hire t*Â»burn down Miss Flat
ley's house. Cannon was taken to the
prison by a Call representative and
stated that Soeder was the man who
had made the proposition to him to fol
low Miss Flatley. "1 am positive that
he Is the man," said Cannon, "and I
should like to see him fully dressed.
Then I would swear to it."
The police for some unknown reason
have not as yet had the accused man
identified by any of the people who
have given damaging evidence against
him.
The Electicn Committee of the House
Trill hear argument to-morrow on the
!av governing the rejection of ballots
ir. California- Congressman Lavernash
r.i'.l argue his own case.
This, however, does net complete the
recount. The committee has 2041 Kahn
ballots which were, in self-defense, at
tacked by the contest ee. There are
697 Livemash ballots withheld to be
passed upon later by the committee.
NEW YORK, Jan. 1?.â The Journal
has the following from Washington:
The contest of Julius Kahn for Con
gressman Livernash's seat is soon to
b" considered. Mr. Kahn seeks to have
rejected certain ballots on which his
successor vt-as voted for in both the
Union Labor and Democratic columns
and counted as one vote by instruction
of election officials cf San Francisco.
The ballots have been segregated by
the Electicn Ccmsiittee cf the House
of Representatives. Under technical
rull&ra Kaha'g attorney has not buc
ceeded In bavin* enough Llvernash
vc:es throvra out to overcome the lat
ttr'm p!ural!ty. Kahn's contest now
rests upon the rejection cf 62" ballots
en which LJvercash Tvas voted for in
the Union Labor and the Democratic
col-nins.
This afternoon the Electicn Commit
tee ceirpleted the preliminary eegrega
ticn cf all ballots with this result: Liv
err-ash ballots rejected, 1073; Kahn bal
lots rejected^ 1020.
The rejected ballots represent illegal
votes which were within the court
rtllnps cf California, by which votes
are excluded for improper marking by
voters. By this process of elimination
Kahn, oa the face cf these figures, ob
tained a rejection of 43 more votes
than Llvernash.

ADVEBTISEMENT&
A CONTIXUAL DRAG.
The Exact Term.
Only those who have experienced
th% pain and suffering incident to
Piles or Hemorrhoids can know what
a drag and handicap this complaint j
1*: how even the mildest forms hinder
the f^atiem from putting forth his or
her best efforts, while those afflicted
â¢n-ith bleeding and protruding piles re-
alize all the tortures of the Inquisi-
tion.
- It may surprise the reader to know
that there Is a sure, permanent cure
for this disease, as the following tes-
timony from Mr. E. A. Leonard, an
American resident in the City of Mex-
lvÂ», mill show:
"For twenty years I suffered with
piles, sometimes being confined to my
tv?d fcr days at a time. The relief re-
ceived from doctors, both in the Unit-
ed States and Mexico, was temporary,
. and more frequently I received no re-
lief; other medicines had no effect.
It rrajs a continual drag. I vas fit for
nothing. I finally tried Pyramid Pile
Cure; first application was magical;
.1 could not believe I was awake next
morning; I experienced a relief that
I had not known for twenty years.
One box cured me; but not believing
myself cured. I bought two more, but
they are fctill in my trunk. I first
used the remedy in July, 1902; HAVE
HAD SO OCCASION TO USE IT
FINCE. The world should know of
Pyramid Pile Cure. I have no words
to express its merits."
Pyramid Pile Cure is In the forin ]
of a suppository, which is admitted
.by all physicians to be the best prep-
cration for treating piles; it comes in
direct contact with the painful tu-
mors and does ife work quickly and
painlessly. It is sold by druggists,
generally for 50 cents a package, and
there is no other remedy "just as
good."
Write Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall,
Mich., for thrir little book on the
causes and cure of piles, which is sent
frÂ»e for the asking.

Mrs. Magee was taken ill on the
steamer, while going with Professor
AJagee to Stockton, where they' were
to take horses for an outing. This
occurred just after the college' closed
in December.* "She was treated by two
physicians in Stockton, but they were
unable t6 discover the cause of her
malady. Then as a last resort Dr., Mary
Bancroft of Berkeley was summoned
to treat her, and she advised removal
to the Waldeck, which was done imme
diately. ' Even the hospital physicians
could not diagnose- the case and an
operation was decided upon as the only
means of finding out the cause of the
patient's illness.
Professor Magee, overcome with grief
at his wife's illness, a long vigil at her
bedside and nervous prostration, faint
ed on the train *while going . to San
Francisco last night, i He was assisted
to the* boat by friends and laid upon
a seat, but was so Weak upon reaching'
the other side that he was carried "back
to Berkeley. He . recovered somewhat
from his indisposition' to-day, however.
" Mrs. Geneva E. Magee, assistant in
structor in physical culture at the Uni
versity of California and wife of Pro
fessor Walter E. Magee, lies critically
ill at the Waldeck Hospital in San
Francisco. She was taken to the hos
pital several 'days ago and an opera
tion was performed to-day, the result
of which the physicians, are unable to
foretell.

The body was taken to the local
Mprg.u_e, but lay all day, without any
one coming to identify it. It was poor
ly clothed, ' there being no undercloth
ing at all. There were simply over
alls and a coat and vest of cheap mate
rial. There was nothing in*the clothes
that might assist identification. At first
it was thought the man was Patrick
Murphy, a laborer out of work, but this
turned out to Be untrue.
There, are no marks of violence on
the person and death is supposed to
have been due to exposure.* An autopsy
will be held to-morrow morning. The
time for the inquest is not yet fixed.
On their way to the Sari Pablo School
this morning children came across the
dead body of -a man -lying across a

President Dornin has not selected his
special committee to name a city's ex
pert. The matter will be before the
Council next Monday night.
Expert Desmond Fitzgerald's 'report
on the Bay Cities' project is a docu
ment of 10,000 words. / He based his
premises on the theory that a well
regulated water supply should bV
planned for a period of at least fifty
years ahead. In this connection, he
presents the following tables of esti
mated growth in Oakland's population
for fifty years: - - â¢
To lease with an option of purchase
at a valuation to be fixed at this time
is, according to the committee's idea,
a sound business proposition,, based
upon the theory that the city will be
gainer by the increase in value of the
plant as population and vojume of busi
ness shall increase.
B â When legislation may be had under
which a municipality may make a bond issue
for property that in revenue yielding and
self-supporting without the necessity for in
Â«Su-T.n* Jt in the 15 p<*r cent leral limitation, or
C â Possibly legislation may be had permit
ting the lsÂ«u<> nt municipal water bonds whose
principal And- interest could be guaranteed,
â¢Jid which would be considered, the .Eame as
district school bonds, n.- outside the legal lim-
Hetion Â«f 15 per cent.
. A lease with the option will admit of the
deferment of a water plant purchase until a
rccre opportune reason, viz:
.A â When the increase in the total assessed
valuation of city property will admit of the
lpfue of the amount of bonds found necessary
at the time, or
Objection was made to the purchase
of the plant at this time on the ground
that the money to be expended there
for could be raised later under more
favorable conditions. On this point the
committee says:
President Dingee's offer on behalf of
the Contra Costa Water Company car
ries two proposals. The first, to sell
outright at this time that portion of
thÂ» plant which pertains to Oakland's
supply, has been rejected by the com
mittee in favor of the leasing plan.
Mayor Olney called attention to the
second proposition of the Bay- Cities
Water Company, which will be laid
before the City Council. The company
will submit a new statement provided
the Council will make a. long-term con
tract.
At Maj-or of the city and th* head of the
executive arm of the government it would be
entirely out of place for me to express an
opinion one way or another about the report.
I have not been consulted about It and do not
think it Is my province at this time to say
anythinir about the report. In due time I pre
sume the matter will reach me In an official
way.
The Bay CUies Water Company has
sent word to Mayor Olnry that it de
sires to submit a second proposition to
supply Oakland with water. In its
proposition the company proposes to
fix a definite rate by the million gallons
on a long-term contract basis. The
figure has not been announced.
Touching the report Mayor Olney said
to-day:
This brings into collateral view the
effect of an acquirement by Oakland of
the main source of supply with relation
to sister cities and the suburbs. Those
who are pressing the question of con
solidation see in the move an argument
for annexation and a drawing of closer
bonds of unity of interest among the
three cities and their suburbs.
Complete elimination of the Contra
Costa Water Company from the pol
itics of Oakland and the opportunity
to acquire -municipal control of a water
supply without the immediate expen
diture of $6,000,000 or thereabouts, are
the elements that have in large meas
ure controlled the special Council com
mittee in its recommendation to accept
the company's offer to lease, under op
tion to purchase, its plant to the city. .
Though it has been pointed out that
this move is not final in the effort to
gain a municipal water supply to the
city the Council has taken the first stop
touard adopting the report. It has
authorizf-d President Dornin to appoint
& special committee of three which
shall select the city's expert represen
tative Â«in a board of arbitration which
will find a valuation of the water com
pany's plant as a basis of operations.
Under the company's tender the offer
to sell or to lease includes that portion
of its plant essential to Oakland's sup
ply. The distributing systems of Berke
ley and Alameda and other sections
of Alameda County supplied from the
same source as Oakland are not in
cluded.

Professor Charles Mills Gayley's seg
regation of the men and women in
his courses at the University of Cali
fornia is being persistently miscon
strued by the people interested and
heaps of real live coals are being let
down on his unfortunate head. Editors
all over the State are shying their pens
at him and other people not properly
"on the map" are saying things that
would not be called complimentary.
Miss Martha. Rice, president of the
senior class, does not -believe that co
education will suffer at Professor Gay
ley's hands, and in an interview to-day
phe did her best to set him right be
fore the editors and the public.
"There is nothing revolutionary about
ft," she said. "It is simply a common
sense way of settling a question that
has vexed Professor Gayley for a long
time. Neither men nor women can get
the best out of the classroom where
one sex overwhelms the other in num
bers. No man wants a roomful of
women staring at him when he is re
citing; neither does a woman enjoy the
reverse condition. It is the only solu
tion of the Question and should not be
construed as a blow at qo-education." ,
Max Thelen, president of the 'Asso
ciated Students, said the same thing,
only In a little different way. He thinks
It is hard enough anyway for an engi
neering student to get culture, wlth

NEWS OF THE GÂ©MNTY OF ALAMEDA
THE ' SAN FRANCISCO ; CALL, ; j WEDNESDAY, .-JANUARY 20, 1904.
"It has long been the practice of the San Francisco papers to treat news from Oakland,
.Alameda, Berkeley and the contiguous .territory as- having no general valuer as news and as of
no interest to any save in this immediate locality. Residents in other parts of the State could
search the columns of the San Francisco dailies in vain for any, record of the events trans
piring in this vicinity.' For general news purposes the counties df Alameda and. Contra Costa,
containing some 176,000 inhabitants, were not on thef map. Trifling occurrences in Oregon vil
lages and fourth-rate towns in the interior of. California were printed in the -regular grist of
dispatches, while accounts of important events in Oakland and adjacent cities were buried in the
'suburban page,' which is omitted from the regular editions circulated in San Francisco "and
elsewhere. As a result of this discrimination Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley are kept in the
background by the papers which exclusively purvey the morning news in this section.'
, "This discrimination is as short sighted as it is unjust and invidious. It is gratifying to
note that The Call is wide awake and; broad enough to break away from a practice wholly with
out justification from the standpoint of cither fairness, or. enlightened newspaper' policy. The
general readers of that paper can now learn >vhat is going on in the cities of Oakland, Alameda
and Berkeley and the numerous towns and villages in their tributary territory. When The Call
is sent East or abroad it will contain daily evidence of the fact that there is a city named
Oakland in'California inhabited by nearly 100,000 people. The Tribune presents its compli
ments ta ; The Call, and trusts that its "enterprising example .will not be lost on its con
temporaries." â¢ ' " " . " â¢
Under the head "Good for The Call/' the Oakland Tribune in its issue of Monday, the
iSth.inst.. also commends The Call foV its policy in publishing all the news of Alameda County
for the benefit of all the people. The Tribune says ; : # .Â¦â¢Â¦'.
"The Call has adopted the policy of running the news of Oakland, Alameda and Contra
Costa County in all editions. This is an agreeable 1 change from the prevailing method of
handling news from the eastern shore of the bay in the other . San , Francisco newspaper of
fices, and one that will be appreciated by The Call's readers everywhere, particularly by sub
scribers in Alameda and Contra Costa "counties. It is another proof of The Call's up-to-date
methods in gathering and presenting the news. / ' ; -. *. â¢
OAKLAND, Jan. 19." â The Merchants* Exchange to-night indorsed the course of The
$an Francisco Call in running the news from Ahuneda County through all editions
of the paper. At the regular meeting of the board of directors of the exchange II. C.
Capwejl, president of the Security Bank and Trust Company, said The Call had proved
itself worthy of the support of every merchant of Alameda County. In the course^f his
address Mr. Capwcll said: *
*tFor many years the San Francisco papers have published practically a separate
edition for Alameda County, but the moment that a citizen of this county went to an
other part of the State he knew iiothing of what was occurring here until he returned.
At last Alameda County has been recognized, and one of the papers has decided to run the
Alameda County news through all of its edition. That paper is The San Francisco Call.
As the first to recognize this county, The Call deserves and should receive the support
and patronage of this exchange, and T. for one, hope that it will receive it."
Mr. Capwell's remarks were received with approval, expressed by applause and cries
of "Yes, yes!" and "That's right!"

The Spanish Consul in this city has
received a letter from the Chamber
of Commerce of Cordova, Spain, re
questing American manufacturers to
make exhibits of farming implements
and machinery at the exposition to
be held at Cordova in May of this
year. The city of Cordova is the cen
ter of a rich agricultural country, but
its development has been slow owing
to the lack of modern farming imple
ments. The coming fair will be broad
er in scope than those of . former
years and as machinery of American
manufacture seems to meet with par
ticular favor a good field is open to
local manufacturers. The text of a
letter forwarded by Carlos Carbonel.

The Construction Company "Amer

a capital stock of $10,000. The direc
tors are Philip Meyer, Peter Harden,

A rather startling development oc
curred yesterday in the case of Ed
ward and George Marshall, who are
charged in Judge Conlan's court with
battery on Mrs. Sarah Rogers, who is
probably better known to first nighters
as the widow of "Duxie" Rosenbaurn.
the wealthy wholesale liquor dealer,
who killed himself some years ago,
leaving his fortune to his wife.
The defense introduced a witness by
the name of Miss Marie Feulk, who
gave her address as 322 Mason street.
She testified that Mrs. Rogers bad of
fered her $200 to say that she was a
witness to the alleged assault, but she
spurned the offer. She told Sarah to
take back her gold, for gold would
never buy her. '.-,
Notwithstanding the evidence intro
duced by the defense, it was somewhat
evident that Judge Conlan believes
Louis Marshall actually, assaulted Mrs.
Rogers. A decision will bs rendered
to-day. â¢

The landlady was unwilling to part
with them. She is said to have held
out one trunk in the hope that some
day the twins might return to the
old home and she would have clothing
to dress them through the winter.
They applied yesterday to Judge Fritz
for a search warrant permitting them
to recover the missing luggage, and it
was issued. Look out for stunning
wardrobes when the twins get posses
sion of that trunk!

Were in trouble yesterday. A land
lady withheld one of their seventy
eight trunks when they attempted to
move from Peasley street to a more
satisfying neighborhood, where the
thoroughfares are paved and âlights
shine through the fog.
The Commissioners of Public Works
filed the report of their investigations
into the condition as to safety of the
various theaters with Mayor Schmits
yesterday afternoon. The final report
ha3 been under consideration by Com
missioners Schmitz and Casey for three
days. They disagreed on certain items
contained in the report and some were
eliminated as being too drastic. After
the report "had been revised it was
handed to the Mayor. The latter de
cided not to make its contents public
until he had thoroughly gone into it.
It is understood that the report or
ders many changes in the construction
of the Alcazar. Fischer's and the Or-
Dheum, in order to make them safer
ir. cases of fire or panic. It is said
that certain of the alterations required
would compel the closing of one or two
of the houses for a period of time.
The theaters announced safe after a
few minor and unimportant alterations
are made include the Columbia, Tivoll,
Central, Grand Opera-house and Cali
fornia, which are pronounced entirely
safe as to exits and other requirements.
A number of minor theaters located
in stores are unfavorably reported on.
with a recommendation that they bs
closed unless they comply in every re
spect with the theater ordinance.
"Well, you're a liar," said Moran.
"You get out of my office." said
Baehr, advancing threateningly toward
Moran, "or I'll put you out."
Moran and Baehr moved fiercely on
each other, and the latter adminis
tered a shove to Moran. who then stovd
not upon the order of his going, but
went at once.
Moran in explaining the action of thÂ»
commission in only verbally notifying
Baehr to audit the demands said it
could not do anything else. It. how
ever, wanted Baehr to assume the re
sponsibility of paying the demands of
the men. some of whom have been
waiting three months for their salaries.
The men involved in the controversy
are J. J. Sullivan. chiÂ«f plumbing in
spector: G. J. Berger. Almshouse clerk.;
N. J. Barry. W. T. Koran. E. A. Cale
garis. clerks City Ifispital: Arthur
Garms. messenger; F. Ruddy. ni?ht
watchman: W. H. Lamb, market in
spector: W. J. Hudson, machinist Fir*
Department, and C. J. Murphy, cashier
Department of Electricity.
Baehr characterizes the course of the
commission in refusing to give a writ
ten notice that it has rescinded its ac
tion in disapproving the payment of the
demands as preposterous, and he re
fuses to assume the responsibility when
the commission is on record as disap
proving their payment.
'Do you mean me?" a3ked Moran.
"Yes. I mean you." said Baehr.
An exciting scene occurred yesterday
afternoon in Auditor Baehr's office dur
ing a wordy altercation, in which Sec
retary Edward Moran of the Civil Ser
vice Commission passed the lie to
Baehr, and the latter ordered Moran
out of the office. Baehr accompanied
his order by an emphatic shove of
Moran, and the latter lost no time in
getting away from the irate Auditor.
There were no blows struck, although
for a moment a full-fledged boxing
bout, regardless of Marquis of Queens
bery rules, seemed Imminent.
The trouble arose when Moran en
tered Baehr's private office and In
formed Baehr that he could audit the
demands of certain employes In the
Board of Health. Fire Department and
Department of Electricity, the payment
of which had been previously disap
proved in a written communication by
the commission because certain civil
service rules had been violated In the
appointments. Baehr desired to know
if the commission would file a written
notice to that effect in order to rescind
its previous action.
"Oh, no," said Moran; "I give you
verbal notice. Commissioners . Rogers
and Bahrs say it will be all right for
you to audit the demands, as they want
to see the men get their money."
Baehr was dissatisfied with this expla
nation and said: "The Commissioners
want me to do something which they
Â¦will not do themselves. I think they
are a lot of 'crooks' in their way of do
ing business, and you are in with
them." >*'.
Meyer is now in charge of Church's
affairs. Church is still confined to his
home by illness and has .not been out
for many days.
The proceedings in court were per
fectly amicable. H. L. E. Meyer Sr.
of Meyer. Wilson & Co. was present
?nd suggested that his son and partner,
H. L. E. Meyer Jr.. be selected as re
ceiver. This was agreed to readily by
Attorney E. S. Pillsbury for Meyer,
Wilson & Co., Charles Page for Balfour.
Guthrie & Co. and Warren Gregory for
Girvin & Eyre. Judge de Haven made
the appointment of Meyer and fixed the
bond at $20,000. The bond was filed
soon after the adjournment of court,
the bondsmen being H. L. E. Meyer
Sr. and Thomas Binney of Balfour,
Guthrie & Co.
This showing was. however, con
tingent upon the market to some ex
tent. If the price for pig iron should
go up the value of the assets, which
consist largely of iron, would increase.
If the market price continued its'down
waid course the assets would shrink
accordingly.
Joseph Hutchinson made a statement
in court in which the general situation
was outlined. The largest creditors are
Meyer, Wilson & Co., the indebtedness
being approximately $200,000; Girvin &
Eyre, to whom JCO.OOQ is due, and Bal
four. Guthrie & Co.. to whom, in round
figures, there 'is due $35,000. Of the
$i"00,000 due to Meyer. Wilson & Co.
$17<X000 is secured. Included in the lia
bilities are notes of M. W. Upton and
others amounting to $20,000. the liabil
ity of Church being due to the fact that
Church indorsed the paper. As $15,000
of such notes were paid last Saturday
;t was presumed by Attorney Hutchin
son that all would be found to be good.
The indebtedness, so said Attorney
Hutchinson, might be further reduced
by failure of some of the pig iron now
under contract to appear in this city.
Some of it' was still not declared abroad
for export to the United States. In ad
dition to the three larger creditors
there were many others, but none for
large amounts.
In the United States District Court
yesterday Judge de Haven appointed
H. L. E. Meyer Jr. as receiver to wind
up the affairs of Seymour B. Church in
bankruptcy. Church filed a petition in
bankruptcy in which he averred tht
he was unable to pay his indebtedness
in full and gave as the reason the
slump !n the price of pig iron which
had been bought under contract to the
extent oflS.000 tons when prices were
higher. With the petition in bankrupt
cy Joseph Hutchinson. attorney for
Church, filed several schedules in which
the condition of Church's financial af
fairs was shown in detail. The show
ing filled many sheets of legal paper.
As summed up the schedules showed
that the liabilities were, on the face of
things. 5465,672 42. To offset this there
were assets valued at J 442,559 74. The
assets, in other words, were shown in
the schedules to nearly equal the liabili
ties.
The hiring: will be resumed this
-mining when one o-f the employes of
thÂ« undertaking firm will be placed on
the stard.
Mrs. Fair's body also had been placed
in a copper case in the reverse order.
It was wrapped in a silk sheet and
Â»hit> kid shoes and eilk stockings had
heen t>lac<rd uix-n it. The head was so
badly crtish*>d that the face was un
recognizable, the bones feollng to the
touch like m much broken crockery.
Th* body was in a ir.nre advanced stage
of decomposition than that of Mr. Fair.
Th<* arliaen stated that to the best
. r hi? IcnOTrJedse the head of Mr. Fair
had r.ot b*en removed to bÂ« used as
an exhibit in the case, as has' been
report <vi.
Up ksew that the mother of Mrs.
Fair was ir. th<? city at the time, the
autopsy was performed, but did not
think hÂ»? was taking any risks in per
mittins it. as h<; had received instruc
tirr.s from Mr. Oelrichs to prepare the
bodies for an autopsy by Drs. Wii
liarr.Fon and Galwey. and had simply
followed h ; s instructions.
The first witness called yesterday
morning was Samuel A. White of the I
undertaking firm of Porter & White, j
Mr. White testified that he received the t
bodies at the Oakland mole on Sep- !
timber 12. 1&02. and accompanied them ;
to his undertaking parlors in this city.
During the time of transit the coffin? j
v. ere never out of his eight. They were j
placed in the parlors, where they re- '
inained for about an hour, when they j
removed to the autopsy room that j
Drs. Williamson and Galxvey might \
perform an autopsy. Witness was j
piesert when thÂ«? coffins were opened.
He found that the coffins were fas- ;
tened with patent ciamps, but could j
not te!l whether they had been ta-m- j
pered with after first being closed or i
not. The coffin containing the body of i
CharJes L. Fair was first opened. In
side the cofSn was a copper shell con
taining the body, but this shell was
reversed, the cap that should have been
over tho face being above the feet.
The head was entirely wrapped in j
bandases such as are customarily used
by i-hysicians- ar.d so far as the wit- j
r^?s could tell th<Â»;e bandages had i
r.ever been disturbed. The doctors ope- j
lated tmly on the head, the body being i
placed In a sitting posture for the con- t
vfnier.ee of the doctors. The bony f
structure of thÂ«Â» head was in good con- j
d:ti<T. but the flesh decomposed. â¢
The action was brought to set aside
the agreement entered into between
Mrs. Hannah Nelson, mother of Mrs.
Charles L. Fair, and other heirs at
law Â«.-f Charles Fair. The case is be- \
tore the court in New York State and j

Filcher said that the middle space the
Sacramento Valley delegates had in
sisted upon giving up for the front row
in the show was preferable to the place
the valley had traded for. "Southern
California gets a place now where it is
bounded by four aisles," he said. "The
Sacramento Valley counties are on two
aisles only. I couldn't help it. I tried
to show the "Sacramento Valley dele
gates that they had better stay where
we put them when the space was allot
ted Sunday, but they have decided oth
erwise."
Afer the exchange Commissioner
Wiggins was asked for his version of
the matter. ' r Â¦'Â¦"''';
"It is very easy to tell it." he said.
SOUTH IS THE WIXXER.
.Commissioner Wiggins met them and
promptly surrendered the space he had
and took in lieu the space in U* e center
of the exhibit. Wiggins smiled urbane
ly, as is his wont, all through the dajv
H* said that; his counties, would be sat
isfied to exhibit in the" middle space and
that the Sacramento Valley counties
were entirely welcome to the place orig
inally assigned losthe southland. To say
that Commissioner Filcher Was aston
ished when he found that the Sacra
mento counties and the Southern Cali
fornia counties had agreed to trade
room in the big show puts the case
mildly.* %fe
On Monday a delegation came down
from the Sacramento Valley to inspect
the layout of space as prepared by the
Commissioners. They saw where the
Southern California counties were and
made a vigorous protest. In fact, some
very strong language is reported to
have been used on Monday, and the
one room occupied by the commission
in this city was the scene of great in
terest. Telegrams were sent and confer
ences took nlace. When the shades of
evening fell Monday the Southern Cali
fornia counties had still the space that
had been allotted to them. Yesterday
morning the delegates from the Sacra
mento Valley dropped into the com
mission's headquarters again and re
newed the struggle to get the space on
the main aisle.
SACRAMENTO DELEGATION".
A. lightning-like change of space was
effected yesterday, with the consent of
the California Commissioners to the St.
Louis Exposition, by the counties of
the Sacramento Valley and Southern
California. The Commissioners met
Sunday night, with Secretary E. B.
Willis, to finally allot the space in the
agriculture building at St. Louis to the
counties and'sections that have decided
to make collective exhibits representa
tive of their several localities.
There are twenty-nine counties that
are to exhibit their products and re
sources apart from the State's collec
tive show, and if San Francisco suc
ceeds in putting' up a building on Mu
nicipal row there will be thirty counties
that seek individual distinction. In this
array is included every county south of
Tehachapi, and more â¢ than a score of
counties north of the dividing range of
mountains that separates Central and
Northern California from Southern Cal
ifornia. <
"When the allotment of space was fin
ally agreed upon Sunday, night by the
Commissioners, or practically agreed
upon, subject to some slight modifica
tions that may be found advisable, the
counties of the Sacramento Valley were
given space in the heart of the Califor
nia exhibit. In front of them and fac
ing on a main aisle were the counties of
Southern California in solid array.

Unless the French republic has cruis
ers to spare from the territory of Ton
kin and soldiers to burn from the
dreary -wastes of Algiers, a low
browed sailor named Louis Corvee will
answer in this country for the murder
of a shipmate named Vincent le Meur.
Yesterday Judge Mogan decided that
the local courts had Jurisdiction over
the prisoner and the offense and com
mitted the prisoner without bail.
The murder was committed on board
the French windjammer Vercingetorix
while she was moored to the Vallejo
street wharf on the night of January
12. f Corvee cut a slit in his partner of
the forecastle because his victim re
fused to romp with him around the
deck at the unholy hour of 11 o'clock at
night. From the effects of the playful
gash Le Meur died. Both men were
citizens of France and the crime was
committed on board of a French ship..
The French Consul at this port de
manded the custody of - the prisoner
from Chief of Police Wittman on the
first day of Corvec's arraignment,
seven days ago. The demand was
based on the articles of the Consular
Convention, signed by " the United
States in 1S52. Prosecutor Greely was
unwilling: to turn over the prisoner to
the tender mercies of a court that sent
Dreyfus to a long confinement on an
uninhabitable island, so he dug out
some dust covered tomes in the Dis
trict Attorney's office. In one of the
cases contained in the volume, legally
known as "120 U. S. Reports," decided
by Chief Justice "Waite, one of the
greatest jurists of modern times, was a
decision reached in the case of People
vs. Weldenhus, to the effect that any
crime committed on board a foreign
vessel that disturbed the peace of the
people residing in the port where the
crime was committed was clearly with
in the jurisdiction of the courts whose
authority extended over such* ports.
It was decided that the Consular
Convention treaty applied only to dis
cipline aboard ship and did not extend
to felonious assaults which might affect
in any manner the quiet or unquiet
that usually covers the water ffont of
a large city. It was shown that in
1S59, eight years after the signing of
the Consular Convention treaty, the
Court of Cassation in France 1 rid ex
actly the same view when it tried and
convicted the captain of an American
ship for killing his mate and seriously
wounding a sailor in the port of Havre.
Judge Mogan listened to the authori
ties cited by Prosecutor Greely . and
committed Corvee on the charge of
murder without bail. His word is as
the law of the Medes and Persians and
never alters. Though the French bom
bard San Francisco and level the Hall
of Justice to the ground. Corvee can
still be found safely landed on the
gTass in Portsmouth square and the
Judge on some roof in. Chinatown,
dealing out equal and exact justice to
all men and looking for a chance to
pass on the French sailor's crime.
The defendant denied all the charges,
and said that her landlady ,was unduly
insistent in overseeing family affairs,
in which she should have had no Inter
est. Judge Cabaniss was puzzled some
what over the conflicting testimony
and allowed the case to be continued
for one week. The fact that the defend
ant had removed to an abode at 220
Kearny street weighed strongly on the
side of acquittal, because the interven
ing distance is an ample guarantee that
no further trouble can come between
the two women, unless one of them is
really looking for it.
Emma Kessinc took her troubles be
fore Judge . Cabaniss yesterday. She
complained that Ellen Raifson had bat
tered her in a flat at 732 Ellis street and
then locked her in a room, where she
rusted in a vile repose for two solitary
day?. Mrs. Kessing claimed to be the
owner of the flat, and said she had
rented it to her alleged assailant and
her husband. She retained one room
for herself, and it was in this narrow
abode where the imprisonment is said
to have occurred. r - :^ \ ' V

NOT one of the least interesting or instructive by
paths in historical studies is that which leads to
a survey of the repetition in a new age of events
of moment which have passed down into the record of
the years. That history repeats itself has come to be an old
maxim. That history should have repeated itself with
such absolute fidelity as it has done in the affairs of the
Russian strvre during the last. five years is beyond prece
dent. The first years of the new century are witnessing
an identical replica of the Russian diplomatic panorama
which was spread before the eyes, of a wondering world

for very often the key in which a song
is written happens, to be too low or
too high, to suit the voice of the singer.
While songs are sometimes written in
two keys, in a majority of cases it is
not so, and the person singing the song
is obliged to depend upon his accompa
nist to change the key in case the one
in which it (the song) is written is not
suited to his voice. If the pianist is a
student of harmony this is a compara

Dr. Hole's Humor.
Dr. Edward Everett Hale, the new-
Senate chaplain, expresses himself as
vastly pleased with the welcome he ha3
met everywhere in Washington. The
doctor tells with glee of an incident in
Boston at Christmas time. He had
preached in his church and referred to
three great anniversaries in the month
of December. After the sermon a young
reporter said: "Doctor, I can think of
but two anniversaries in Decemberâ the
landing of the pilgrims and the short
est day of the year. What was the
third?" Dr) Hale answered: "If you
think it of sufficient importance, young
man, you might add Christmas day to
the landing of the pilgrims and find a
substitute for the other one you men
tioned."
niment that it shall make one perfect
whole, rather than two forces at war
â¢with each other, is most certainly a
genius and worthy of much musical re
spect.
It is not always that such an accom
panist is to be found, however, and all
too often the soloist's tones are marred
by the determination of the accompa
nist to bring his performance at the
piano into undue prominence.
We have all, I think, suilered while
listening to performances of this kind,
for they are far, far too common, and
one is liable to be oMiged to endure
this form of egotism at the hands of
the accompanist at almost any concert
one happens to attend. It is most an
noying to the singer or soloist of any
kind, and a good accompanist is always
in demand. Therefore our pupil should
give the attention necessary to accom
paniment work and improve every op
portunity to serve his friends and ac
quaintances in that capacity.
A reliable accompanist can make an
excellent living, and there is a large
field open lor any one who is willing to
take up the study of accompaniments
sf-riously.
In the first place he must recognize
the fact that he is not called upon to
perform a duet with the singer (or vio

PLAYING ACCOM PANT
SI EXTS.
WE find an interesting item in an Illinois paper.
A young couple haH taken leap year by the fore
lock and were married. Nothing singular :n
that. It has been going on in Illinois for years. But the
town paper held them up as an example of' heroism
theretofore unknown in Illinois, from Fever River to the
Sangamon bottoms, because the bride had bravely con
sented to spend the honeymoon on a ranch in Pasadena,
California.
The newspaper pictured the austerities and trials of
life on a ranch, its isolation from society, its unbeautiful
surroundings, its demands on nerve and courage, and
upon this somber . background projected the love-lit
spirit which induced .this brave pair to dare it all and
brave* it all, and survive or perish in the midst of all, in
testimony, to their great absorption in each other.
. , Th.? '^wonder of all this is that there -should be in an
Eastern newspaper office, even, in-. a,.cross roads town
with a country hotel, a blacksmith shop, a saloon and
"an oldest inhabitant." such' ossified and fossiliferous
rgnorance of California. That young couple will leave
home, with a foot of snow Â¦, on the ground, the old man
growling about the coal bill and the old woman frugally
darning wool socks of the vintage of 1840, with the hoofs
of the cattle frozen and ready to come off at the first
thaw, with the house banked to the bottom of the win
dows with stable manure to keep the potatoes from
freezing in the cellar and with blankets over them to
help out, and they will journey to the awful sacrifices of
ranch life in California.
When they arrive they will find the ranch house in a
bower of blooming roses and the lawn sprinkled with
daisies and crocus. They will sit in the evening in a par
lor scented by sheaves of flowers, and if there is any fire
it will be the romantic blaze of a hatful of pine cones.
Under the house there will be no cellar, the potatoes will
be new, just out of the ground, and they will be in the
midst of days of bliss and nights elysian, where the tints
of the earth and the hues of the sky, in color though
varied, in beauty may vie, as the poet said of the Levant,
the lesser California.
Hardship indeed, and on a California ranch! The
young couple will 'find' there a telephone by which they
may visit and gossip from Texas to Puget Sound. They
will eat fresh strawberries and shad, and it will seem
like the nectar and ambrosia of Olympus. The conven
tional honeymoon will go by. If then they were back
in Illinois, the bride would be rising to kindle the fire,
and would go out to scrape up an apronful of chips with
an unrbmantic icicle hanging to the tip of her hose. The
bridegroom would come in at night out of the snow to
grease, his boots with tallow and beeswax, and growl at
the bride because she can't find the pain killer to rub on
his chilblains. The romance would have gone glimmer
ing. ,Buton a ranch in California the passing of the
honeymoon, is unknown. The humming birds are help
ing the bees rot> the January 'flowers of their sweets, and
the days go by in a glory of warmth, color and pleasure.
iirjslf Calypso had known of California she would have
made Ulysses Sail straight for the Golden Gate, and
when she arrived, she would have recognized the land of
the lotus and sent immigration agents back to her tight
little islands to bring over the nymphs and their trunks
and chattels.
California is the land of the perpetual honeymoon
Luna transacts no other, business here.' From horns to
full orb she is in that business, and all nature conspires
with her to invite the young and fond here, to eat the

Country Critics.
There could be no question in "the
mind of the most skeptical that they
were newly wedded and on their honey
moon. Even had they not displayed
those peculiarities in dress which coun
try couples affect on their bridal tours
their languishing smiles and inane re
marks would have made known the
fact that they had but recently been
made one. They had come to San Fran
cisco to spend the first sweet days of
married life, and were trying hard to
get their money's worth of sightseeing.
In the course of their perambulations
they had come to an art gallery and

and his original criticisms had attract

last the' couple came to a' halt before
an excellent reproduction of "The An
gelus," while unnoticed behind them
was a rapidly growing gathering of in
terested listeners.
"Oh, Frank dear," she exclaimed,
"what is that funny looking couple do

He cast his eye about for data and
failed to secure any information be

"It is a scene vnear Los Angeles," he
observed. "That is the. way most of the
people down there look when you get
outside of the city. The man and his
wife have been digging potatoes. Now
they are trying to find something they
have lost. The sky-blue-pink-and-yel
low sunset is a fake. The fellow who
painted it probably has not been around
here long and put those colors in "just
to attract attention, as they do with

SAN JOSE. Jan. IS.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
Apropos of the "Betterment to Lead

Call, an avenue 160 feet or more wide,
from San Francisco to San Jose, with
a park 50 feet wide in the center and
the entire avenue lined with semi
tropical trees and the hardier ones of
the temperate zone, is a suggestion I
have to offer. This would be the finest
avenue in the world.
Palatial homes would eventually line
this avenue: the highest style of the
horticulturist's art 1 would be every
where and arboriculture would be the
universal workaday spirit of every one.
The park, proper, to have the choicest
of flowers. "What an education. Here
would be satisfied the tastes of the
lovers of botany. Landscape architec
ture would be the all-pervading influ
ence and there would virtually be built
one continuous city from San Jose to
San Francisco on the line of this ave
nue. Yes, sir, this would make the fin
est drive extant. It would be the most
instructive one in its art, offering: as it
would the view of the bay. "the moun

When the House of Representatives; sought to destroy
certain evils that have grown out of civil service it cer
tainly was dangerous policy to try to kill the institution

Many persons who play the piano ex
trtraely well cannot play accompani
ments at all acceptably. There are sev
eral reasons for this, and the first is
that accompanists are. as a rule, born,
not made. Accompanying is a gift by
itself, and a very valuable one. The

follow the soloist's every thought and
so to weld together song and accompa-

scholar in order to feel an interest in
these documents. Here 13 an invitation

which he upbraids his father for not

there is a small fragment of a poem

bringing about a reconciliation with
her brother Charaxus. with whom she
had quarreled because of his devotion

THE great harmony dinner in New York, eaten by
the invited Democracy and paid for by Tammany,
has been the means of renewing the party jangle
and wrangle. In the first place, it is announced that Mr.
William Randolph Hearst is affronted highly, of such an
altitude that no apology can unaffront him, because he
was not invited. Â¦ ,
When McClellan and the Tammany ticket were elected
in New York, Mr. Hearst modestly announced that he
did it, and that victory perched on his banner and
preened its feathers there. Under such circumstances to
deny the company his inspiring presence was something
not to be forgotten. But it is said of him that, in view
of the further fact that he is the leading candidate of the
party for the Presidency, not to give him a chance at the
fried chicken, or at least the opportunity. to send a letter
full of delirious inspiration, was an .injury to the party.
That is not the only crop of trouble planted at that
dinner. Mr. Olney's ascription to Mr. Cleveland was a
breeze fanning all the smoldering Democratic hatred of
the ex-President. Many Southern members of Congress
wheeled their Gatling vocabulary into line and opened on
him. They were not even restrained while he was in the
silent house mourning- over his first born, but went into
interviews attacking and defaming him, their hard spirit
making no truce even in the presence of death. The
spectacle led Senator Dubois of Idaho to declare that
the Democracy cannot be got to agree on the Ten Com
mandments.
The scene has its sad and instructive features. Mor
gan and Gorman are fighting the President on Panama,
while the Legislatures of Louisiana and Mississippi are
instructing their Senators to support the administration
and ratify the treaty, and the commercial bodies and
press of the South are unanimously joined in the same
course.
Out of all these sounds of confusion and creature com
plaints issues the last and only possible cry to the coun
try to justify the election of a Democratic President. An
eminent Massachusetts Democrat says that he is the
friend of Mr. Olney. but that Olney is ah impossible can
didate, for he doesn't know politics when he meets it in
the middle of the street with a cow bell on its neck. This
gentleman says that the safety of the future requires a
Republican Senate and House and' a Democratic Presi
dent. He views Mr. Roosevelt with alarm, but his posi
tion concedes that the Republican party is the ark of
national safety, therefore, it should continue in control
of Congress.
This undoubtedly discloses Â«the plan of campaign for
this year. Republicans will be asked to trade the Presi
dency for Cdngress. It is expected that, this will utilize
the enmity of the trusts against the President, and will
secure the votes ; of all-,the grafters, boodlers and swill
suckers who have been hard hit by the President in his
campaign of purification;â It is really Mr. Bryan's fusion
plan over again, ' without formal action as in his case.
The Adullamites all over the country will be asked to be
patriotic and save their country from injury, by.yoting
in a Republican Congress, and at the same time save
their dollars' gained Â¦â¢dishonestly andÂ«in some cases them
selves from 'prisoh'^'and fatten 1 their grudges, by voting in
a Democratic President. ., ..'. |
We find it unthinkable that the country should indorse
such a programme. Its proposition is based : upon "the
declaration that President Roosevelt is, unsafe, tfcat he
precipitates crises, that he disturbs business. How?
Have not these very men howled unceasingly for enforce
ment of the anti-trust laws, and that the President's rigid
and always successful enforcement of them constitutes
the disturbance of business, with which he is charged?
In the same count is included Cuban reciprocity, but
only ten Democratic votes were cast against it, and the
leading papers of that party everywhere supported it.
Again, it is charged that he is hasty to the verge of peril
to the national peace. How? In what matter has hp
shown inconsiderate impetuosity? Here Panama is
charge'd as an offense. If Morgan, or Gorman, or' Olney
had been President will either say that he would have
done differently?
This country has had to obey 1 its / responsibility under
the treaty of 1846, by guarding the isthmus" through fifty
three revolutions against New Granada and Colombia.
These outbreaks were caused by Bogota's .misgovern
ment of the isthmus. But did they admonish Bogota to
institute there better government, as a means to stability
and order? No, and for the obvious reason that the pres
ence of the United States forces each time enabled Bo
gota to subject the isthmians to her misrule. Under
such circumstances it was to be expected that Bogota
would^ reciprocate by ratifying â¢ the canal treaty, after
having dictated its terms and conditions and given it ex
ecutive sanction. But that was not done. When the ex
pected revolution ensued what were we to do? Were we
to proceed, the fifty-fourth time, to enable the suppres
sion of the independent aspirations of Panama, and con
tinue in power there a government that refused to gov
ern well at home and to keep faith abroad?
There is not a thoughtful American, who appreciates
the importance of the canal and the honor of his country,
but will say that the fifty-third subjection ofrthelisthmus
was sufficient, and that President Roosevelt took the
course dictated by national honor and humanity. *- Then
where is the impetuous "spirit, which imperils peace, in a
policy that serves mankind and has prevented the fifty
fourth murderous war on the line of the world's high
way?
Minus the Moral.
This is a story without a moral. A
true tale, however, and treasured in
the archives of the Washoe Club as an
argument in favor of poker and hard
liquor and an illustration of how things
sometimes happened in Virginia City's
mad, delirious prime. The hero of this
chapter from the early 70s was W. B.
Thornberg, who twenty years before
had made a name for himself as Sheriff
of Yuba County. - He is dead now, but
the story of how his fortune was found
ed, the tale without a moral, still lives.
Thornberg had been speculating in
Savage. His little all was tied up in
the stock,' which was steadily dropping
In value. As the stock's worth -waned
the greater waxed Thornberg's disgust
at his choice of investment.
"I'm going to sell jhy Savage right
away," he told a friend. "It goes lower
and lower and first thing I know it
won't bring enough to buy me a ticket
to San Francisco."
On his way to order the sale of his
stock, however, Thornberg dropped into
the Washoe Club, where he waS per
suaded to take a hand in a poker game.
The game proved fascinating. It con
tinued all that night, went along with
out interruption until the next day's
sun arose and was still going when
darkness once more fell. As he played
Thornberg drank whisky. The strain
of the game, lack of sleep and the gen
erous flow of liquor finally wore him
out and when he went to bed it was to
sleep the round of the clock.
Upon awakening his first thought was
of his stock. "It's pinched out by this
time and I'm busted sure," he solilo
quized as he bathed his aching head
and prepared to visit his broker and
learn the worst.
Soon after Thornberg started to play
poker rumors of a strike in Savage had
reached Virginia City. The drooping
stock revived. The rumor was con
firmed. The stock went up by leaps
and bounds. When Thornoerg returned
to earth it was quoted at $300 a share
and when he sold his holdings netted
him nearly $250,000.
should read something new every day
âand the more the better, in fact, he
should keep at it until he can read
music at sight as fluently as he can
read, a novel â and then keep at it still
more.
Next, he should follow the singer's
voice absolutely and utterly. He must
never branch out into his own inter
pretation of the song, ; even when he
considers that the singer has the wrong
interpretation. When he starts to ac
company the voice he loses all respon
sibility of direction. His mission is to
follow, and to follow so in the footsteps
of his leader that the feet of both shall
leave but one impression.
He must listen to the words of the
song as they leave the mouth of the
singer, so that he may keep in perfect
touch with song and singer at the same
time.
He must feel the song as the singer
feels it â must express the- same en
thusiasm when approaching the climax
that he feels to be vibrating the voice
of the singer. Side by side they should
so through the softer passages and in
the fortissimo (very loud) parts the
singer should never fall to feel the sus
taining power of the accompaniment.
The accompanist's eyes and ears must
be everywhere at once. He must train
his mind so that as His eyes rest on the
music they not only take in the notes
of the singer (as his ears take in the
words of the song), but they must at
the same time read ahead a measure
or two, in order to be prepared for any
sudden freak of the soloistâ any varia
tion in time, a crescendo or an un
looked-for ritard.
The pupil will, I think, understand,
afte.- reading this lesson, that 'he art
oC accompanying is net to be treated
lightly. It is, however, a most delight
ful accomplishment, and is, as I said
b3fore, a most lucrative profession, if
one is willing to work a little hard at
first. The real work comes only at
first, too, for when one has once
learned how to accompany, it is never
forgotten. If one works hard at it for
a while,, it all comes in time, and, put
ting aside all thought of the money one
may earn in this way, the boy or girl,
man or woman, who can play accom
paniments well is always in great de
mand and most deservedly popular,
when people wish to arrange a Jolly
evening. In other words, an accompa
nist is never a "wallflower" â he cannot
be, because too much depends upon
him.
To look at the matter more seriously,
accompaniment playing is splendid
mental and musical training for any
one, even if his whole aim is to be a
solo pianist. He gains musical insight,
quickness of thought and a power for
understanding what he reads on sight
that is hardly to be gained in any other
way. Moreover, his horizon is wid
ened constantly, and he is brought in
touch with music that he would know
nothing of if he were to confine himself
take for their sole guide the precepts of that holy relig
ion, namely, the precepts of Justice, Christian Charity
and Peace." Within five years of that time Czar Alexan
der, the founder V>f, this Holy Alliance, was offering to
march his army into Spaing to crush the patriot army
which was fighting against tyranny. This was the teach
ings of that "holy religion." '
In August, 1898," there came from Czar Nicholas an im
perial rescript borne by the dove of peace over the
troubled waters of European diplomacy, a very olive
branch to the world. It was a plea for universal disarm
ament; the world over righteousness and peace should
kiss one another. "This, by the help" of God, will be a
happy presage for the century which is about to open.
It will converge into one powerful focus the efforts of
all states sincerely seeking to make v the great conception
of universal peace triumph over the elements of . trouble
and discord."
To that peace congress which was invoked by the
grace of God and the piety of Czar Nicholas, there came
all nations to listen to the angelic voice of peace on
earth, -good < will toward men. Japan was there; China
was there. Now within the fleeting, space . of .five years
we see this altruistic Czar marshaling all of his resources
so that the weight of his mailed fist may be laid upon

By both Alexander and his soulful successor the grace
of the Almjghty was invoked "in behalf of schemes for
the relief of the ills of suffering mortals. Both rulers
earnestly desired that all the powers co-operate with
them in their mission of charity. They were willing to
become the humble instruments of divine power; to be

The ugly and lofty fence that has
walled in for many years a lot In the
back of the Charles Crocker property,
standing on Sacramento street and bit
ing out a portion of the handsome
grounds that extend through from
I California street to Sacramento, is
finally to be torn down and a neighbor
hood eyesore will be done away with
forever.
Years ago Charles Crocker, as the
story goes, refused to pay an exorbi
tant price for the lot that the fence has
Inclosed. There had been several in
succession raises in price on the part of
the then owner of the land. Finally
Crocker caused a high fenca to be
erected, so securely braced, that the
stiff breezes from the west and the
gales in winter could not move It more
than they could the Rock of Gibraltar
had it been in that spot.
\At various times it has been reported
that the property, had ' been finally
bought by the heirs of the Crocker es
tate, but these have repeatedly proved
to be false. Still the fence stood and a
new generation talked abo^t It and
tourists asked questions about it.
Charles Crocker prepared to cap Nob
Hill with his mansion. Yung died
some years ago and the property came
I into the possession of Yung's widow.
She is dead and the lot, all fenced in,
fell to the ownership of Yung's chil
dren.
They have sold it to Thomas J. Bar
bour, an agent of the Cr.ckers. The
space that the fence has so long in
closed will be covered with lawn anJ
flowers and the Crocker property will
hereafter include an entire block
bounded by Taylor,' Jones, California
and Sacramento streets.

In her communication Miss
Schmindt calls attention to a procla
mation issued by Mayor W. J. Wyn
coop of Severance, Kans., declaring
that bachelors must accept offers of
marriage under penalty of forfeiting
their citizenship. Miss Schmindt fur
ther says:
"In this city it is a notorious fact
that there are hundreds of single men
in all walks of life of marriageable
age and well qualified to take
unto themselves a wife.
"I think that there should be a
law in this city making it a misde
meanor for any man - to refuse
to marry a young lady who proposes
to him so long as it does not inter
fere with the principles of his reli
gion. And I think it is in accordance
with. God's ordinance that every man
should be married. ' This being leap
year, a young lady. would have. the ex
cuse to make the proposal. Hoping
that vour . honorable board will â¢ see
the justice of my request that the ac-
â¢ ' Ernestina* Schmlndt filed a petition
yesterday with ! the Board, of Super
visors that an ordinance be , passed*
providing that "any male person over
the age of 21 upon being proposed to
by an unmarried female over the age
of IS years and who is of the same
religion and is not engaged . or pro
hibited by the law from intermarrying
who shall refuse to accept such pro
posal and' to marry said female shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor."

The home of the bride was trans
formed into a bower of beauty by the
prodigal use of roses, carnations and
palms. The bridal table was radiant
with American Beauties twined in tulle,
with pink shades. Magnolia blossoms
filled the air with tropical perfume,
while the palms bore out the semblance.
The service was performed at high
noon by Rev. Dr. Case, the assistants
at the ceremony being Angelo Baldocchi
and D. Ross Atkinson for the groom
and Miss Mabel McCormick, maid of
honor, and Miss Sue Pierson and Miss
Ruby Cooper, maids for the bride.
The bride was radiant in a gown of
cream pofnt over taffeta, with a dainty
veil of tulle enveloping her figure*.
The maid of honor, Miss McCormick,
was gowned in pink mousseline de soie,
while the bridesmaids wore dainty
frocks of pink and white chiffon.

The board appointed to examine of

motion will ocnvene within the next few
days at the Presidio. The board is com
posed of Lieutenant Colonel William H.
Heucr, corps of engineers; Lieutenant
Colonel Thomas H. Handbury, corps of
engineers: Lieutenant Colonel George
H. Torney, deputy surgeon general, U.

The Pacific Coast is soon to have the
finest military maneuvering grounds in
this country, and they are to be located
in San Luis Obispo County and that
immediate vicinity. Three magnificent
tracts of land have been offered to the
Government. In each is about 20,000
acres. The choice rests among the
Nacimiento rancho, Santa Margarita
rancho and the J. H. Henry property.
The committee originally sent to look
into the question favored the Naelmien
to rancho, but as rumors reached
Washington that fevers and malaria
lurked in that vicinity a halt was called
in the proceedings until an examination
could be made by a medical board. Con
sequently the Government sent Colonel
George H. Torney and Major William
Stephenson to look into the matter.
They are much pleased with all the
properties in question, and an elaborate
report has been prepared by them,
â¢which goes to Washington this week.
The lands are all described as being en
tirely suitable as sites for a permanent
military camp, where all the United
States troops and State militia could
meet and be r>ut through all sorts of
maneuvers and drills. For this camp
Congress is willing to appropriate 5500,
000. There are to be three other camps
of a similar nature in different parts of
the country.
The squadron of the Ninth Cavalry
under command of Major John Bigelow
Jr. is daily being put through its paces.
Three times a week the whole squadron
turns out, and on the alternating days
the individual troops are being drilled.
The present grounds are not at all ade
quate for the maneuvers of the squad
ron, and it will only be a short time be
fore it will be necessary to utilize the
golf links for the purpose. The links at
the present time are not quite in Ehape,
as the recent rains have made the
grounds soft and slippery. By the be
ginning of March they will be in fine
condition, and then the cavalry will
have a chance to go under full swing.
The new council of the golf club, com
posed of Lieutenant Joseph S. Oyster,
U. S. A., retired; Harry W. Hoyt, Dr. J.
R. Clark, Robert Woods and Fred H.
Beaver, will undoubtedly be equal to
the emergency and will be able to se
lect another eligible site a little farther
from the city.
All attempts to try to find the colored
soldier who slashed Mrs. John M. Car
ney have practically been abandoned.
Mrs. Carney has vsiited the barracks
many times to try to locate the man
who made an attempt on her life, but
she has been unsuccessful and cannot
locate him. The wound on her neck* and ,
face is slowly healing, but she will j
wear an ugly scar through life.
Unless General Warfield, lessee of the
California Hotel, and the owners of
that property,, among them William
O'Brien Macdonough, soon arrive at
some satisfactory agreement regarding
a new lease of the well-known Bush
street hostelry, its present manager v wlll
retire on May 1. The present lease of
the hotel expires on the last day of
April and in anticipation of this fact
General Warfield and the local agents
of the owners have been trying to ar
range for a new lease of the property.
The owners have notified General War
field that an advance in the rental of
the hotel will be demanded upon the
renewal of his present lease and have
inserted other provisions in the docu
ment which have made it objectionable
to the lessee. Several conferences be
tween the interested parties have been
held, but with no satisfactory result,
and it was finally decided to refer the
entire matter to representatives of the
Macdonough property in the East. To
them General Warfield's objections and
his suggestions of modifications of the
terms of the proposed new lease have
been submitted and on their answer
depends entirely the future of the Cali
fornia Hotel In so far as the general's
Interest in it is concerned.
The local representatives of William
O'B. Macdonough stated yesterday that
there was n6 unfriendly feeling in the
matter, for they fully recognized the
fact that 'under General "Warfield's
stewardship, covering the last ten
years, the California Hotel had been
conducted in' a very satisfactory man
ner and they would be glad to re-lease
the property, to him in preference to
any one else. They admitted, however,
that their "principals are anxious to
realize a larger Income from the hotel
and would probably Insist on an in
creased rental, even if it. -was necessary
to find a new lessee.
In speaking^ of. the matter last even
ing General Warfield said that he ex
pected to know definitely in 'a few days
whether he, would remain as manager
of the hotel for another ten years. He
said he was prepared to retire if the
owners of the property refused to mod
ify the conditions of the new lease, but
he was hopeful that Â¦ they would con
sider his suggestions- in a favorable
light. General Warfleld assumed the
management of the California Hotel ten
years ago when it was not regarded as
a' paying property owing to its then
objectionable location. His manage
ment was^soon' attended.; with success
and before , he had been many months
in charge of the hotel he had rid the
neighborhood of objectionable sur
roundings and fostered several public
measures that eventually resulted in
the improvement of the streets in the
vicinity and the bringing of good ten
ants into them.,., At present his hotel is
filled. with permanent guests, who wait
with much anxiety a settlement of the
existing difficulties, for they are re
luctant to lose the comforts of the home
that General Warfield's management
has provided for them.
The Chamber of Commerce has ar-'
ranged to* hold its seventh annual ban
quet at the Palace Hotel next Satur
day night. This will be the first affair
of its kind that the organization of
commercial men has held since 1892.
The original plan was to honor Gov
ernor Taft with a feast and brilliant
speeches, but since that official has
announced his intention of taking only
a birdseye view of this city from the
deck of a Government tug it was de
cided to hold the festivities without
him. The banqueters will hear a large
number of eloquent addresses by men
prominent In most of the higher walks
of life. No pains will be spared to
make the affair successful from every
point of view.
Some of those who will speak are
Charles Spear of the Harbor Commis
sion. University. Presidents Wheeler
and Jordan, Professors Bernard Moses
and Carl Plehn, Hugh Craig, ex-presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce, and
H. D. Loveland, president of the Pa
cific Coast Manufacturers', and Jobbers'
Association. Before, after, and. be
tween these addresses will be read the
annual Chamber of Commerce reports
by the president, secretary, treasurer,
librarian, election committee and the
Washington bureau.
At the first meeting of the trustees
following the annual meeting of the
chamber yesterday resolutions were
adopted favoring the installation of a
pneumatic tube service for mails in
San Francisco, and requesting the
Washington authorities to permit beef
sold to the navy on this coast' to be
put into barrels made of California
woods. E. Scott was re-elected to serve
as secretary, treasurer and librarian for
the year of 1904. The following stand
ing committees were then appointed:

bout to Carter was greeted ".with cries
of. "Foul." Choynski was out nearly
four minutes and appeared' irT* '"great

This deplorable state of things comes
about, Miss ; Leonard concludes, be
cause while all men are united in.in
sisting on a living! wage,, women have
no scruples about working for anything
they can get/' The woman breadwinner
wants the living wage, too, and left to
herself she might get it; but she has
the women ; to compete with who. live
in families -where'. "a- .'father or. brother
pay the rent and provide the food. Such
women do. not need a living" wage. On
the contrary, . they can afford to work
for an exceedingly low wage and yet
get plenty, of spending money out of it.
Because of j these ; pin-money workers
manufacturers offer what is practically
a starvation wage."**Men will not accept
it,' no self-supporting- woman can live
on it;- the- only -class, who -will ..take it
is the class of supported and protected
girls who" have created it.. The living
wage is lost â¢ to that special industry
forever. ;. The pin-money worker has de
stroyed all other chances but her. own;
driven men out of that. branch partial
ly or entirely and cheapened her own
labor. But she is quite satisfied, for
her 53 50 a week buys all the feathers
she needs.
.Miss Leonard cites the case of the
shop girl as one illustration of the fatal
influence of the ; pin-frnoney worker, and
that of the, garment maker) as the oth
er. In large cities the shop girl has
driven out the male and destroyed 'the
living wage, except In a few first-class
houses." As for the-grirl wh6 has to live
on\ her own wages, the bigl stores will
not take, her any more," and if - they
woiildfshe could not : live "on her. pay.
That ? line : of industry has practically
been . closed to her. by the worker for

CAUSE OF BAD CONDITIONS.
The Question of a woman's right to
work" for pin money and the effect upon
the labor| market for the employment
of women are discussed helpfully by
Priscilla Leonard in Harper's Bazar.
In common with a great many women
and most men, she deprecates the man
ner in which women who have a home
and maintenance . guaranteed to them
insist on pushing themselves into the
industrial field for the Bake of the few
extra luxuries", their work will' give
them. She shows how the influence of
women on wages is always to lower
them, and she quotes an English au
thority to the effect that wages in any
trade arc sent downward steadily; in
proportion to the number of women
employed. . â¢ . ':^i'-71

unite with the British ami Foreign
Bible Society in the observance of the
centenary of the British Kociety March
7. 1904. The world wide observance
of Sunday is proposed and a joint ap
peaP to all denominations throughout
the world will soon be Issued.
The British and American societies
exist to translate the holy Scripture*
into various languages of the world
and circulate them without note or
comment free of charge in cases of ne
cessity, but otherwise at prices irre
spective of the original cost, which
bring them within easy reach
of the poor. During the past
hundred years it has distributed over
180,000.000 volumes in about 370 lan
guages, and at a total expenditure of
over $70,000,000. The needs of the na
tions are said to be still unsupp ed. If
all the books the society has ever is
sued could be distributed among man
kind to-day, eight people would have to
join at each copy, and in each group
of eight two or three would not under
stand the language. â New York Com

Despite the great shortage in the pear
supply, more than 1.000,000 boxes of the
fruit have been kept in store in Amer
ica. A "corner" in. pears is of rare oc
currence, but one seems to have been
"engineered" this season.
The general failure of the British and
the European crop is the cause of the
"corner." It is estimated that quite
Â£100,000 will be made in extra profits
by the holders of the stocks. If the
fruit is kept until After Christmas the
extra profits may come out at Â£250.000.
The British fruit brokers have been
astonished that the fancy prices pears
have recently realized, ranging from
15s to 20s a case, have not brought over
heavy shipments. Instead of the 5000
cases expected last week, fewer than
200 came to British ports.
Had it not been for Canada similar
tactics would have been adopted with
apples this Christmas. The. Canadian
apple has filled the gap caused by the
failure of the British crop. Had It not
been for their 50.000 and 100,000 pack
ages weekly, the trade would have been
in the hands c-f American speculators,
and values this Christmas would have
been forced up 25 per cent.
Last year Canada shipped us 3,000,000
bushels of apples, and this season the
arrivals should be heavier still. Dur
ing the past week over 200,000 bushels
of prime Canadian apples have oocn
unshipped in London. Liverpool, Man
chester and Bristol.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19.â The talent
and the books split even on the day,
three favorites out of six coming in
first. Celebration at 15 to 1 was the
longest chance that got first . money.
The weather was chilly and the track
good. '
A very " bad start killed whatever
chance J. V. Kirby, the favorite, had
in the first race. Kirby, ' Valmar, Ef
fervescence and Phyz were . standing
sidewise to the barrier when Â£ it was
sprung. Winnifreda won In. a drive
from. Rio Chico, Andrattus third.. .
Tim Hurst, with J. Boland up, . won
the two-year-old, event, De Grammont,
the favorite, second, Hilona thli*d. Bo
land outrode Walsh at the finish.'
Celebration repeated his race- of a*
few days ago at 20 to 1. To-day he
opened at 20, was backed down to 15 at
post time and won the. third race'eas-,
lly. Lady*Fonse got in second and the
favorite, Madame Bishop, third. Geisha
Girl fell as the barrier went up.'
Paul Whaley won his first start in'
the fourth race at six and a half fur-'
longs. He opened at 6, but at post time
was favorite at 2" to 1. Montana Peer
ess beat Mexicanna for the place.
Blissful was -never In the running.
There was nothing in the fifth race
but Sais. Opening at 1 to 4, he went to
1 to 7 and won as "he pleased. Lady
Belair got the place and Susie Christian
the show.
The favorite, Buccleuth, easily won
from Merwan, with Invlctus third in
the last race. Summary:
Decision whether the freshman base
ball intercollegiate contest shcruld be
played In one game or In a series was
deferred until Saturday night.
BERKELEY, Jan. 19.â The athletic
committee of the University of Cali
fornia decided to-nicht that both the
freshman and the university football
games with Stanford University shall
be played this year on the Berkeley
campus.
This action was in response to a re
quest from Stanford that the freshman
game be played at Palo Alto. The com
mittee voted to adhere to the original
intercollegiate agreement. Orval Over
all was re-elected a member of the ath
letic committee.

Ed Stutte was about the only one of
the big bettor? that profited over the
â¢win of Antolee. He played the mare
straight and show.
Bell, who rode Rockaway in the
handicap, was fined $25 for rough rid
ing. On the stretch turn he cut into
the rail too sharply. Flightly interfering
with Xigrette.
ENTRIES IX)R TO-DAY.
The bad leg of Mt. McGregor went
back on him just below the eighth
KleinTTOod. winner of the second
race, was bid up from $500 to $1000
by Frank Dosb. The stable retained
the colt.
Quaker Cirl o;>ened favorite for the
next, a six-furlong selling affair, but
seemed to be in no demand, and her odds
receded from 8 to 5 to 2%. Together
with Libb-e Candid she cut out the
early pace, and finally landed in the
show. Kleinwood. backed from 3 to
1 to 12 to :. and with a chunk of
Â¦weight off from his previous race, won
in an ordinary gallop from Scherzo.
The winner was well ridden by Lar
sen.
Charley McCafferty finally an
nexed a purse. Although it was the
first start at the meeting of Quiz II,
the track looked made to order for the
gelding, and the books made him a
favorite. El Chihuahua played a
Ttrief ensrajement out in front and
thon save up the lead to the first
choice. At the close, when too late.
Flyer came very strong, bringing
Jack Martin on Quiz to a drive to
*core by half a length. Modder
downed Pure Dale for the show.
Again in the mile and seventy
yard sellins. number were the McCaf
ferty colors successful, this time
' Antolee carrying them to the front.
Quoted at 15 to 1 and ridden by
Frankie Repd. the mare had the best
going in the run home, getting a nose
dec'fcion over the favorite. Silurian.
Hildebrand rodea stupid race on
Mr. Dingle or the Judge entry would
I have won. Instead of picking the
good goins in the stretch Hildebrand
clung to the rail, where It was* deep
est, and then finished third, beaten
NOTES OF THE TKACK.
Old rehabilitated Mt. McGregor
started again in the introductory i'u
turity course sprint and broke down.
H*e had Hildebrand on his back and
closed a 3 to a favorite. Leading a
furlong from - the stand, the ancient
racer suddenly begran backing up, and
finished next to last. The winner
turned u:Â» in Sir Preston, a 12 to 1
shot, which floured first in a three
nose finish with Lady Kent and Idogo.
Foley rode the winner.
Owner "Packey" Ryr.n vainly en
deavored to land a stake event or a
handicap with Ben MacDhui. and in
despair dropped the big bay horse into
a cheap selling race at Oakland yester
day. It was the concluding event of
the afternoon, and at odds of 1 to 3
MacDhui v.on the length of two Pull
man dining cars from Johnny Lchorr's
colt Avenger. When tt winner, which
was in for $500, was broirM up to be
aold C. Paders. the partner of Sidney
Bender, began the tilting with $100 bids.
Johnny Schorr did manage to say $1500
once in a deep bass way that missed
the Judges, but Paders nev~r paused
until he reached the $2000 mark. "Pack
ey" Ryan calmly came back with the
customary $5 bid and the horse reposed
by his own fireside last nigrht..
The track was sloppy, and with two
exceptions the accuracy of the sharp
.shooters in picking the mudlarks was
unerring. Favorites made railway con
nections with four purses. Antolee at
15 to 1 proved the s=tar long: shot per
former. â
Only four started in the handicap at
six furlongs, and the Burns & Water
houno three-year-old Rockaway, with
102 pounds up, made a cathop of it.
Seven to ten was the closing price about
the colt, and with Bell up he was never
beaded. Mildred Schultz disposed of
Kigrctte for place honors. Waswift,
from Joe Yeager's stable, cut a very
Â¦mall figure in the running, but will do
later on.

SAN FRANCISCO CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
Collegians Are Unable to Deter
mine Whether Freshmen Shall
Play a Series of Contests
It developed after the fight that Sul
livan sustained a simple fracture of the
right arm above the wrist in this round.
The Injured member was attended by
the surgeons at'the Receiving Hospital.
Sullivan also received a ; . bad cut over
the right eye,. which bled freely.
Berger had a decided lead in the third
round. In the fourth round he went
after his man and beat him badly about
the body. He finally scored a right and
left to the head and Sullivan fell to the
floor on his face. He. was unable to rise
and his seconds carried him to hW cor
ner.
Berger was seconded; among others
by those well-known "amateurs," "Spi
der" Kelly and Jimmy | Britt, while
Harry Foley, Frank Telfer and others
were in Sullivan's corner. 'â¢?_â¢':â¢
William Stewart was given the deci
sion over George Murray after four
hard rounds." Stewart insisted before
SULLIVAN IS INJURED.
The so-called .. amateur Â£ boxing exhi
bition of the Lincoln Athletic Club drew
a. crowd to Mechanics' Pavilion last
night but little smaller than that which
is attracted by one of the big cham
pionship' fights. The gallery 'was filled
to its capacity, while few vacant seats
were in. evidence on the main flodr.
The club's matchmaker had skimmed
the cream of the "amateur" boxers and
the \ bouts showed", his i handiwork. The
fights were all of the. sensational order,
some of the rounds being full of action
and clean, hard hitting. :
: The feature number on the card was
the bout between the : heavyweights,
Sam Berger and George Sullivan. Ber
ger fought well in . streaks, but he
showed the lack of practical experience
in the, ring. â¢ He needs a number of
easy fights and Â¦ considerable more'
weight and strength before he can
realize the hopes of his friends, who
,see in him championship material."
In the first round: he dropped Sullivan
with neatness and dispatch with, a short
left hook to the jaw." It was almost
the* first blow, struck and shook up
Sullivan . badly. Berger tried to end
matters quickly, but he could not land
a decisive blow. He'cut Sullivan badly
a1>out the' hose and mouth. In his
eagerness he slipped down, but was up
at once. . Both j were slugging at the
end of the round."
Sullivan; went to the mat four times
in the second round, sometimes going
down, to avoid punishment. He kept
fighting back and crossed his right on
Berger several times. ,
"The self-supporting girl is in com
petition with the girl who lives at
home and makes a small contri
bution to the household expanses, and
with the girl who ..is supported and
spends alt her money on clothes. It is
this' division of purpose which takes
the 'spirit* out of them as a class.
-â¢'The men formed a united class.
They had a purpose in common. They
worked because. they needed the money
to . live. The women had nothing In
common but< their 1 physical inferiority
to men. " The children in the factory
were working from necessity; the boys
were working from necessity. The only
industrial. unit complicating the prob
lem was .the . cirls who worked without
being obliged tor-the girls who had all
the mnney they wanted. 'To them the
question of wages was not, vital. They
could afford to accept what the bread-
RUINOUS COMPETITION.
ation is quite as bad, or worse, Miss
Leonard declares. What renders the
tremendous bargains in "white sales"
possible is the fact- that country girls
with homes and food make these gar
ments for wages so small that the city
sweatship is driven into yet fiercer com
petition to hold any part of the trade
at all. Every woman In a big city who
makes her living by* sewing on white
goods is pushed down, relentlessly and
inevitably, to starvation wages. The
women who stitch in cellars. In attics,
fifteen hours a day, with only bread
and tea to keep soul and body together,
are paying for the country girl's feath
er or ribbon. They need a living wage;
she makes it impossible for them to
get- it.
That this holds in other trades be
sides the two cited seems to be the
opinion of the authors of "The Woman
Who Toils." who are quoted by Mls3
Leonard as saying:
"In the factory where I worked men
and women were* employed for ten
hours a day. The women's highest
wages were lower than the men's low
est. Both were working as hard as they
possibly could. Why was this? I can
only relate the conclusions I drew
from what I saw myself. In the mas
culine category I met but one class of
competitorâ the breadwinner. In the
feminine category I found a variety
of classesâ the. breadwinner, the semi
breadwinner, the woman who works
for luxuries. This inevitably drags the
wage level down. *
George Peterson and Joe Thomas
fought four desperate rounds. The
judges decided in favor of Thomas, al
though the spectators seemed to think
Peterson won easily on points. Peter
son was the stronger and timed his
blows better than his opponent. Thom
as was knocked to his knees in the
third round. It v was a slugging match
from the start and both took an in
credible amount of punishment. Thom
as did not Â«eem in the best of condi
tion.
Referee Graney was assisted by Al
Young and Sam, Lyser as Judges. Billy
Roach acted as timekeeper.
Bob Lundie and Jack Burke fought
one of the most sensational rounds ever
seen in Mechanics' Pavilion. Lundie
was knocked down after a few seconds'
fighting. He then .sailed into Burke
and knocked him down. He knocked
him down again, and then Lieutenant
of -Police Kelly took a hand. He or
dered the bout stopped. The seconds
of each man claimed the decision should
go to them, but Referee Graney re
fused to give the fight to either man.
The spectators wanted the fight to go
on, but the lieutenant was obdurate,
although the referee said the fight had
not reached a dangerous stage.
Joe Kelly '.of the Hayes Valley Ath
letic Club eutgamed Jack Bowles of
the. Lincohi Club and was given the
decision after four rounds. Bowles had
a good left hand .and kept Kelly In
trouble for two - rounds. Kelly then
sailed in and beat Bowles to a stand
still. He had a "right swing which
Bowles could not dodge. i
. Al Elkins, a counterpart of Young
Corbett in build and hitting power,
knocked out Abe Label in two rounds.
The winner had a blow which would
bring home the money in any company.
The first round was all 4iard hitting,
without any advantage on either side.
In the second round Label was knocked
down- three times. He first got a right
to the jaw. He went down again from
a left and was then knocked out with
a right to the jaw. U
the fight that they were to, break away
clean. Murray was outpointing him
and hitting In the clinches, so Stewart
tried hitting in the clinches.* and this
turned the tide of battle in his favor.
Murray used a Jolty left, but he could
not- stop .Stewart, who took a lot of
punishment. As they shook hands at
the" beginning of the fourth round Mur
ray hit Stewart and earned the dis
pleasure of the spectators.

The Astral is af large carrier and
brought from Baltimore 5000 tons of

tain Dunham managed to keep within
the* safety limit throughout the pas

While providing handsomely for the

the men and the Astral's forecastle is
a model of hygienic comfort. Captain
Dunham is well known in San Fran

The ship Astral, which got into port
late Monday night, 147 days from, Bal

ever in this port. Captain Dunham be
lieves in paint and has a mate with a

fairly shines. In spite of her dirty cargo
nc man-of-war was ever cleaner' than
this Standard Oil ship and .few jiners

George 'Behes was taken.' from the
City and County Hospital yesterday
morning to the City Prison and book
ed on a charge of â¢murder. He shot
and killed his wife, Mrs. Emma
Benes, on December 7 in the cellar of
the Humboldt lodging-house, 1309
Stockton - street, where she was em
ployed as a cook, because she had re
fused to live with him again. *He had
come from Los Angeles in search of
her. After shooting his wife he. turn
ed thej revojy^ pri himself, but did not
inflict a iseriÂ»HHT wound.
Charged With Murder.
After a careful consideration of the case
we are of the opinion that Captain C. J. Lucky
was negligent In navigating the ferry-boat Sau
salito on November 24, 1903, In not keeping a
more accurate account of the run of the Â»team
er, and In having the compass so covered that
he could not see plainly how the steamer was
neadlnc " â
For such- negligence, and unsklllfulness we
this date suspended his license as master and
pilot for forty-five days. (Damage to stem,
$4000.)
The passengers were taken oft by the Caza
dero. The Sausallta made very little water
and came off the, next morning without as
sistance. . * ,
Captain Lucky testifies that the compass
card was so covered that he could only see
part of it, and thought the- steamer heading
W. N. "W., the usual course. steered from Al
catraz to Â£ausallto; Instead of which' course
she was heading. N. N. W. at the time she
struck Angel Island.
United States Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger yesterday suspended for
forty-five days the license of Captain
C. J. Lucky for runnlng'the ferry-boat
Sausalito ashore on Angel Island on
November 24. The opinion is as fol
lows:
From testimony taken we find the ferry-boat
Sausalito, C. J. Lucky master atid pilot, left
her slip at San Francisco at 8:45 p. m., No
vember 24. the weather being fogjry, with light
wind. When papslng Alcatraz Itland the light
was seen and the fog bells at each end of the
island were heard. " A few. minutes after pass-
Ing Alcatraz, a light on a vessel was seen
right ahead. .Captain Lucky says' this vessel
had been there all day and he had seen and
heard her on his former trips.
When Captain Lucky saw the Might he put
his helm hard a-starboard to clear the. vessel,
then hard a-port to bring the steamer on her
course, then starboard again to steady her,
when the steamer ran ashore on Angel Island,
one-quarter of a mile east of Point Knox. The
fog bell -at Point Knox was not heard. No
land was seen nor echo from the steamer's
whistle heard until just as the steamer struck.
The vessel was running at regular fog speed
and no signals were g\ven to the engine-room
until just as the vessel took the bottom.
The inspectors are makinp.an effort
to determine if the seacock was left
open. The fact that two oilers both
claim to have closed the seacock leads
the inspectors to believe that it may
have been left open by mistake. The
inspectors have shown that if the
pumps in the vessel had been working
half their capacity they would have
rumped even' drop of water out of the
vessel.
The testimony this afternoon went
to show that the water coming in
throuch the broken deadlight had
TK'thinp' to do with the sinking of the
Fhip. Furthermore, that the pump on
th? seacock must have been reversed,
and instead of relieving the ship more
water was being pumped in, until the
â¢"Â¦npine room was flooded and the fires
put. out. The investigation probably
Â¦wrti "to-morrow.
Captain Ifarrv Bullen and Captain
John Oraham of Victoria took the wit
ness stand and testified regarding Cap
tain Lawrence's ability as a seaman.
They 'said he was an able man. L*aw
rence was given charge of the boat
containing the women and children and
Â¦was one of the first to lose his life
in the disaster. The inspectors want
to learn whether he was a capable man
to take- charge of a lifeboat.
Ed Parker, an oiler on the Clallam,
testified that he closed the seacock.
Atkins, thp othjer oiler on watch at the
time of the disaster, says he was the
man to close the seacock. He declares
he did not notice Parker near the
pumps, and Parker says he did no| see
Atkins.
SEATTLE, Jan. 19.â At to-day's ses
sion of the investigation into the loss
of the steamer Clallam, J. U. Atkins,
an oiler cm the vessel, stated that at
about 1:15 p. m. January S he placed
the circulating pump on the bilge and
Â¦within thirty minutes the water had
arisen to a sufficient height to put out
thf fires. In that event, according to
the inspectors, the engines would have
stopped in about two hours' run out
from Victoria. The Clallam at that
time must have been well to the Port
Towns-end side. *
Acording to Chief Engineer Delau
ney, the Clallam had been steaming
in tho direction of Victoria for at least
an hour and a half before he noticed
the water coming in. In any event, the
Fhip had been taking water for more
than an hour before the captain was
notified of her condition.

TO OUR PATRONS:
, We respectfully wish to call your special
a'ttenticn to the present condition of the labor
Every branch of labor, skilled or unskilled,
is overstocked and will remain so all through
this winter and as the supply and demand
governs all commodities, the same always
governs the labor market.
CAUSE:
No biff contracts are being let. and .none
contemplated: many large industries closed
down or curtailed employment of men; large
'sums of money lying Idle in banks awaiting
future investments: labor is always of better
quality when plentiful, hence better class of
help can now be secured. ' .
We were confronted early last spring,
which continued until a few weeks ago, with
a great scarcity cf good, in fact, any class
of labor, skilled or unskilled.
The great demand for help had a tendency
to make labor stubborn, consequently we
were unable to give our patrons such excel-
lent service as we have In former years.
MURRAY & READY
RETURN THANKS.
We are much indebted to all employers who
-thoroughly understood the labor market nnd
helped us to share somewhat the burden put
upon us.-
GOLD CANNOT BUY HONOR.
The burden was not confined alone to the
labor market. Our entire business was at-
tacked by unscrupulous labor agitators and
demagogues, wh6 demanded that we should
BOt supp'y certain employers with any help.
"What can we offer you." asked these agi-
tator? "financially or otherwise, to discon-
tinue 'purplylng them with help?" Our an-
swer: "Gentlemen, there Is nothing in this
world you or any one else has that would pur-
chase from us the freedom the 'Constitution
of the United States' has given us. We will
forever supply all employers of help with
whatever help they may so desire. Likewise
we will give to all applicants for positions
any position he - is competent to fill. Creed.
religion or politics shall never be mentioned
in our office, and when you get through 1 agi-
tating and return to honest work or go into
business for yourselves, come to us and we
will never discriminate, but will try to make
a man of you. A nun amongst men, for all
are equ^l before God and the law. That's
all, gentlemen. Good day." ' - .
WE BELIEVE IN *
JUSTICE TO ALL.
ALL MEN ARE EQUAL BEFORE GOD
AND THE LAW. NO MAN IS ABOVE THE
LAV/ AND NO MAN IS BEIXVW IT. OBE-
DIENCE TO THE LAW IS DEMANDED AS
A RIGHT, NOT ASKED AS A FAVOR.
Then they placed a boycott on our business,
continued It for four months: but when they
found every employer of help, large and
email, rushed right to us with their orders
for help and stood as solid as the rocks of
Gibraltar, seeing we doubled our business,
employing fourteen clerks, 6ent out C0.O0O
men â yenr 190-'? â they held up their . bands,
took off the foclish boycott and declared that
lh*y could not hurt "Murray & Ready."
WHO ARE TRUE FRIENDS OF LABOR?
Procure not friends in haste, nor break the
ties of friendship needlessly.
EMPLOYERS
YOU WELL REMEMBER
DAY AFTER DAY.
WEEK AFTER WEEK.
MONTH AFTER MONTH.
Many other San Francisco employment
atjent? tried to help thÂ»se labor agitators by
distributing leaflets among the wnrkingmen.
reading as follows: "Notice â We do not sup-
ply any employer, firm or corporation who
has a man strike on him." Advertised same
in all S. F. Papers. Result: They soon found
ninny large and small employers of help had
closeu their business relations with such em-
ployment agent*.
NEVER AGAIN WILL THESE WEAK-
KNEED EMPLOYMENT AGENTS RE-
CEIVE THK PATRONAGE OF ANY KM-
PLOYKR WHO BELIEVES ALL ARE
EQUAL. ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO WORK
FOR A LIVING WITHOUT THE DICTA-
TION OF WALKING DELEGATES AGITA-
TORS OR DEMAGOGUES. ,
IT'S AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT
No employer of help knew or knows any
moment they ;Will have trouble, as these la-
bor agitators make a business of making
trouble. 'â¢-.':
No, they could not hurt us. because you,
our cuptomors. stood so manfully at our back:
and for such we are ever grateful; hence
this letter of thnnkn.
MURRAY & READY
TESTING* LABOR LAW IN SUPREME
COURT.
We are testing a most ridiculous law
passed by last legislature. Synopsis of same:
Should any employe of a firm, corporation
or of any employer of help striko for. higher
wages or for any other cause, you, or your
Â»B*nts mUKt toll the next applicant caui<e of
last man leaving you or of his dismissal
Case Is now in Supreme Court. We will
advise you from time to time of eucccss of
same.
Thousands of our customers wish us to
fnd them a full report of our Mr II V
Ready's testimony, two and h -half ' hours'
tirty-five vuRfif. before United R. It of S. F
arbitration' case of U. R. R. versus Street
I'urmcn's Union.
We will isend h copy of report to you. <- O n-
Errssman Llvernash was'attorney for Street
Carmen's Union. He knew more about tho
labor question when he pot through with our
Mr. Ready than If he had studied labor all
his life.
Just as soon as our own printing plant can
turn -out Karan you will receive It
Thanking you for all pant favors and awalt-
Inir a continuance of same very respectfully
yours, , MURRAY & HEADY.

VTo Registrar Adamsâ Finding it
impossible with self-respect to "con
tinue longer in the service. of a depart
ment wherein its employes are treated
with discourtesy and disrespect,, I
hereby resign as Deputy Registrar of
Voters. -;'vH. GUTSTADT JR."
Commissioner Voorsanger made a
plea for Gutstadt, saying he had been
connected with the X>epartment of
Elections for four years and that no
man in the department had been more
faithful or had a better character thah
Gutstadt. Vborsanger contended that
the slight variance between Registrar
Adams and Gutstadt would develop
into a "tempest in a teapot" ; that
Gutstadt had resigned under, compul
sion and that, he opposed accepting
the resignation.
Judge Slack said Gutstadt would
prefer to have his resignation ac
cepted,' because' if" he- were^suspended
and: then restored to office after a
hearing - his . position would be made
unbearable to him. (
Gutstadt's offense consisted of de
cliningt'o measure the heights of ap
plicants for registration and accepting
their, sworn statement of their heights.
Rather than be suspended by the
Election Commission for alleged in
subordination to Registrar Adams,
Deputy Registrar Herman Gutstadt
resigned from his position yesterday,
the resignation being: accepted . at a
special meeting of the commission.
Registrar Adams filed a written rec
ommendation that Gutstadt be sus
pended during trial by the Board of
Civil Service Commissioners. His rea
sons were Gutstadt's alleged failure to
perform work assigned to him untl In
forming Adams, his superior officer,
that he would no longer work under
him.
Gutstadt's resignation was as fol

Harry Bowers denied that he had
ever had a white powder in paper while
in his brother's house, as testified to by
the defendant, and others were re
called on unimportant points. '
Dr. L. D. Bacigalupi, autopsy sur
geon, testified that he hau obse.ved no
sign of tuberculosis or abscesses while
making the autopsy on Martin Bowers'
body. Neither did he notic any sign
that Bowers had been suffering from
chronic alcoholism.
The greater part of yesterday was
occupied in the cross-examination of
Drs. C. G. Kuhlman and John I. Ste
phen, who testified for the defense on
Monday, and the examination and
cross-examination of Dr. S. I. Harrison,
another witness for the defense. It
was shown that there were contradic
tory authorities as to the effect of ar
senical poison on the kidneys and also
as to the quantity of the poison to be
given for medicinal purposes.
In rebuttal a number of witnesses
who knew Martin L. Bow rs for years
were called a.Â»d testified that he was
not a drinking man, but they, admitted
that their knowledge of him only cov
ered the time he was at work. One
witness testified that he had only seen
him take one drink in the* *"!teen years
he had known him.
The trial of Mrs. Martha E. Bowers
before a jury in Judge Cook's court on
the charge of causing the death of her
husband, Martin L. Bowers, by admin
istering poison to him, is drawing to a
close. The evidence is all in and the
arguments of counsel will commence
this morning. The Judge intimated
that he desired the case to go to the
jury to-morrow afternoon so the attor
neys .could arrange the time to be oc
cupied in their addresses. There will
be two on each side, District Attorney
Byington and Assistant District Attor
ney Ferral for the people and Attor
neys Frank G. Drury and Hugh J. Mc-
Isaac for the defense.
W. A. Mathews, a clerk in the em
ploy of the Santa Fe Kailroad Com
pany, has been cited to appear before
Judge Troutt to-morrow xo show cause
why he should not be adjudged guilty
of contempt for failing to pay his
former wife. Lois A. Mathews, $30 ali
mony for the month of rCovember.
Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted yesterday to Delia Imes from
W. A. Imes for neglect and Lucy G.
Marshall from Fred Marshall for de
sertion.
Caroline Berg, who was married to
Charles Berg at Oakland in 1895, want3
a divorce from him on the ground of
extreme cruelty. She says, in the com
plaint filed by her yesterday, that he
has frequently brutally beaten her and
that once while she wa/5 asleep threw
pails of water on her.
Desertion is charged in the complaints
filed by Ethel "VV. Trepanier against
Ernest Trepanier, Arthur B. Saunders
against Mary B. Saunders and James
M. Perkins against Grace F. Perkins.
In the suit for divorce commenced
by Walter S. Erratt against Theresa A.
Erratt, cruelty is the ground alleged.
He says his wife hurt his feelings by
calling him harsh names.
Maria O'Doul is suing Edward J.
O'Doul for divorce for intemperance.
The same ground is, also alleged in the
complaint for divorce filed by Emma
H. Joyaux against Albert Joyaux. Mrs.
Joyaux also alleges desertion and neg
lect.
The husband picked up the stove
and threw it out of the window and
others of the party gave their atten
tion to the unfortunate woman. Be
fore they succeeded in removing her
burning garments, however, she had
been severely burned on the face and
the entire body.
Mrs. Waeber was taken to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital for treat
ment. Dr. Boskowitz, the surgeon in
charge, gives but little hope for her re
covery.
Annie Waeber, wife of Arnold Wae
ber, a barber, and residing at 1124 Du
pont street, was terribly burned at her
home last evening:.
The Waebera were entertaining a
party of friends and had just sat down
to dinner. Mrs. .Waeber had forgot
ten to plape some wine on the table and
her husband got up to get the bever
age from the kitchen. An oil stove
that had been lighted to heat up the
dining-room was directly behind him.
As Waeber pushed back his chair he
upset the stove. In an instant the
blazing oil spread over the floor and
before any one could prevent the
flames set fire to Mrs. Waeber's cloth
ing.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â The promise held out
by the late etcck market o& yesterday was not
fully realized to-day. There was a growth
in the volume of the dealings and in the
breadth of the demand, but the animation did
not hold throughout the session and the gains.
were yielded for the most part before the
closing-, which was irregular. Great hopes
of an enlivened market were built on the
special activity and strength yesterday of
Kock Island and of United States Steel pre
ferred and the second mortgage 5 per cent
bonds. These movemeiys were regarded as
evidences of a return to speculative activity
of some of the leading capitalists of the
time who have refrained from any notable
operations in the market for some time. Thi6
seemed to Indicate an element of strong lead
ership in the market, the lack of which is
supposed to have been the principal cause of
the persistent sluggishness of the' market
since the turn of the year. The professional
and. eemi-DrofeAEional element of the specuÂ«
Jation. therefore, came into the market with
much enthusiasm this morning.
United States Ste*l ureferred sold ex-divi
dend 1*4 per cent and when the price rose to
58^. equivalent to 60 with the dividend on.
It became manifest that heavy gelling orders
would have to be absorbed before the price
could make much further advance. There was
manifest heavy realizing Ir Amalgamated
Copper, which carried It off a point below last
Jiljrht during the course of the day. The Rock
Ieian-J issues also failed to maintain the
buoyant tone of yesterday. These develop
ments in eo important a grout) of stocks had
a discouraging' effect on the bulls and the
subsequent speculation showed a lack 61 en
thusiasm. . â¢â¢
The gxowinÂ«r -abundance of money resources
seemed to have attractions only for opera
tor* in stocks of small railroad and industrial
companies, and . this class of securities again
arsuMied the predominance in the market.
There was a late rise of a point in Union
Pacific. Realizing sales were resumed on the
late recovery and the market closed irregular.
The large dealines in United States Steel
second fives continued. The market generally
wax somewhat irregular. Total sales, par

Butter, Cheese and Egg*.
Butter is steady and that Is all. The northern
markets are reported- liberally Mocked, and thÂ«
southern also, hence they need none of our
Butter, and this market has to absorb all the
receipts. For.tunately they are not heavy.
Cheese continues a drug. AH coast markets
are overloaded and each market is trying to j
< unload upon the other. Anything to get the >
Cheese out of sight. Quotations are largely
nominal, but the general trading figure la \
about lie for No. 1 flats, . I
The declining tendency in Eggs continues. ;
Receipts continue to increase, as usual at this i
time of the year, those yesterday being over j
. 1110 cases. Meat of the fine ranch are going
at 26c, while actual sales of store were made i
yesterday at 21c. Buyers continue to purchase j
only from band to mouth. The retailers are Â¦
now receiving a good many ranch Eggs direct '
from the ranches and are accordingly taking
very little from the wholesalers at the moment.
Receipts were 30,700 lbs Butter, 1142 cases

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Apples are the leading feature of the fruit
market at present, and as receipts have been
light during the past week the market â¢ Is .
steadily cleaning up. Medium and high grade
offerings are in good request and common stock
is moving oft. better than for some time. .A
car of medium grade stock of the Ben Davis
variety was'received from Hood River. Oregon,
yesterday and moved, off well at $1@1 25 per ;
box. A carload of fancy stock is expected from j
the same State before the- end of .the week.
Advices from Southern California say that
shipments of Oranges to Eastern markets are
very light and that stocks are accumulating at
shipping points owing to the lack of cars. In
this market Oranges and all other Citrus fruits I
are plentiful and dull *wing to the continued
â¢cool weather. Seven cars are announced for ;

"Market is unchanged to 10c higher. The j
principal' strength is in Lard. In which there
! has been pretty pood speculative buying the '
j past day or two. Stocks of Lard are not large
and there la more or less talk ftiat the reduced
supply of Cottonseed Oil Is and will be a
factor in its use. Receipts of Hogs are a little
In excess of last year, and while the distrib- I
utive demand Is fairly Rood, yet stocks are
accumulating. Packers are making no effort !
to support prices, but are as a rule rather free
sellers of product. Except for the strength :
1 in coarse grains, we are inclined to think Pro- j

Dried Fruit in New York.
Mail adTfeea from New York say:
' Hand-to-mouth buying is still the general
rule with local distributers, and the market
has a tame ar-peaj-ance. Loose Raisins remain
.:n an unsettled condition, and among handlers
pt-nerslly. the situation Is held to be very us
satisfactory. There is little if any demand
from local Jobbers, and with resale stock from
other markets seeking an outlet here the feeling,
if wet>k. The coapt situation also contains
some elements of uncertainty despite the as
surance that there . it to J>e no reduction of
aeFoctation pricep. While, there is little show
-of interest in forward shipments, we hear that
some f. o b. f-ales of nutside raisins are being
rnflde at low price*, 'which, although riot made
puHic. ar:- said to be at least a cent' a pound
below the association figures. The sales have
not involved any large lots, however. Seeded
" Ttaisins remain eat-y. with moderate sales at
figures. The development of a stronger
ton*- in tbp Currant market has brought out
wniÂ» inquiry for carload lots from interior t>uy-
who.- bow-ever, do not feeru inclined to pay
the pr; res .demanded. The inside quotation is

The Weather and Crops.
' The weekly report of A. G.-McAdie, section
director of the elitnate and crop service of the
Weatber Bureau, is as follows:
OEXERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature during the week was nearly
normal and the weather generally clear until
â¢near the close. Foes prevailed in the coast
districts and heavy frosts occurred in most
sections. Rain corcmenced falling Sunday morn
ing and extended throughout the State during
the day end night. Heavy snowfall is re
. ported in U>e mountain districts.
The precipitation In some portions of the
south was more than half a.n incfa end is the
first, general rain since September. It will un
doubtedly prove of great benefit in softening
the eoil fer cultivation, starting grass and im
proving the condition of orchards. The raln
â¢ fail this season in some parts, of Southern Cali
fornia is reported lees than in any season since
1&4.9. Fair crops of grain and hay will prob
ably be raised In the s..'jth If later conditions
&re favorable. The rain was not so badly needed
in the central and northern sections, but will be .
beneficial to grain and feed. Plowing and seed
ing are in progress in most sections. Grain
continue* in good condition in th'e central and
northern districts, though its growth is some
what slow on account of cold weather. Pros
pects for large Crops ar* excellent. Green feed
is plentiful, but growing rather slowly. The
reports of heavy looses of cattle through
drourtit appear to have" been exaggerated.
The cold weather and lack of moisture have
retarded the development of Southern Califor
nia oranges in most places," the fruit being of
small sire and late in coloring. Frosts have
caused but little damage, owing to timely fore
casts. Work in orchards and vineyards Is-pro
gressing rapidly.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.
The temperature during the week was about
normal, with cold nights and sever% frosts.
FogÂ« prevailed in the river districts. Heavy
rain fell in all sections at the close of the
week. The noil is in excellent condition and
â¢ rapid progress is being made in plowing and
t-eetfing. Early sown grain ts looking well and
prospects are good for large crops of wheat,
barley and oats.. Green Jeed is plentiful, but
- )ts growth has been somewhat checked by cold
weather. The rain will, undoubtedly prove
"beneficial to grain and grass. Stock axe in
rood condition. Orchards and vineyards are
looking well and cultivation is in progress. No
material damage has been done by frost.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.
The weather was clear ana cool most of the
Â¦week, with frequent fogs alon^ the coast and
heavy frosts In tb* interior. Rain fell in all
sections at the close of the week and will be
of inestimable : value ln # the southern districts,
where the aoil had become very dry and pas
turage had -nearly failed. In the central and
northern sections early -sown grain and grass
continue in good condition, but growth has been
retarded by cold weather. The rainfall In the
southern districts will enable farmers to re
bUTne plowing and seeding, and with favorable
conditions through the spring It is probable
that rood crops of grain and hay will be raised.
The loss of cattle" in the vicinity of San Luis
Obiepo was not eo'great as reported. ,. Tree snd
vine planting and pruning are progressing
rapidly.
BAN JOAQCIN VALLET-
Generally clear, cool weather, wjjh foggy
mornings and frequent hea*-y frosts, prevailed
during the week. A generous rain fell over the
enrjre vallfy Sunday and Sunday night. It will
be of rreat beneOt in preparing the soil for
plowing and seeding and in starting . graÂ« and
early town grain. Plowing and seeding are
progressing and the grain crop will soon bn
planted In the northern portion of the valley;
in the central and southern portions, where
cperatiOTi* were delayed 'on account of the dry
weather, plowing and Â¦ seeding will be com
menced. GrasÂ«< and early eown crain In the
northern ruction have made but little growth
owing to cold meatber; In " the Â¦ central and
southern portions dry feed is very scarce and
Ktork are suffering, but the recent rain -with
f-:eja.son8ble weather will Boon make green feed
plentiful. Prunirwr' and cleaning orchards and
Â¦vineyards nre progressing rapidly.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
Clear, warm weather continued until near the
'lose of tl* week. Light rain commenced Sum
Â«isy afternoon, continuing Into the night in'
, nearly all pecUons. This la the ant " general
rain Fir.ce September, and, though compara
tivrly light, will undoubtedly be of consider
able benefit. The precipitation in some places
Â»Â«Â« more than half an Inch, and this Â«vjll
soften the toil, start pasturage Â«nd Improve
orchards. ThÂ»- observer at San Qlego reports
that les* rain had fallen up to the 16th than
Jn *ny reason j,ince JSia. . A pood deal of work
na* U-en done recently in water development.

CHICAGO. Jan. 19.â The crowd In the wheat
pit was bearish at times on an improved out
look regarding the war situation. The peace
ful utterances Â¦ of the Czar were reflected in a
fair advance in the price of British ..consols,
which tended to relieve anxiety in the minds
of shorts'. To give further assurances prices
in foreign grain markets were lower. As a
I result opening Violations here were easy. May
being- unchanged Â¦ to *4c lower at 88%c t&
SS%c. During the ear,ly part of the session j
there was considerable selling by professionals I
and prices were inclined .toward lower levels.
Support by the leading long, however, pre
vented any. great loss. At the. end of an hour
talk of a big flour _; demand â¢ at Minneapolis
appeared to affect, Â¦Â¦tile sensitive local shorts.
Those who had,8old, % on the early bearish news
subsequently wanted the wheat back, but
found to therr sorrow that offerings were' not
forthcoming.- The "result was that the market
asfcumed a . bullish aspect and prices started
upward. The market was further strength
ened by the announcement of a decrease of
."{,010,000 bushels in the world's visible supply
figures. The strength in outside markets also
deepened the feeling of conviction in the. minds
of many traders that long side was the safe
side of wheat. ..In consequence an active de
1 mand r>revaM*d the remainder of the session.
On the advance May -sold up to 90c, and
though there was heavy realizing at that flg
- ure, offerings were well taken and the close
was strong' at M)%@-90c.
Corn was weak early, those nouses which
have been active on the bull side of late sell
ing on a fairly large scale. May later sold up
. to 4UT4c.and closed at 49?iijS49%c.
Oats were much' easier. The elcs* was firm,
(Â¦with May a shade higher at 41%@41%c, after
I selling between 41%c and 41%c. â¢
ij Provisions had a firm undertone and busi
ness ;was of. a' good volume. There was buy-
I ing by commission houses for Investmentsac
!* count and at the same time a good deal of '
[ selling by holders Â¦ with profits on the hard
j spots. An advance of 5<gl0c in prices for hogs
helped to strengthen the sentiment, while the
higher prices in grains' were '-a late bull. The
close was firm, with May pork 2*Â£c higher at
$13 '20. May lard was up Tifcc at $7 17Â»Â£; ribs

of Dr. Dowie took many millions with
them to Australia.. They are now In
that country, but they did not take any
large" Bum of money with them."
..New.comb was then tasked if it was
riot possible for Dr. 'Dowie 'ta dispose of
.the. various busines"s~ enterprises in
Zion* City, as they*-vere\ in his own
name and that he could sell them if
he so desired. ' ' /* ./
'He replied that Dowie could do so,
but that he would not'do sq,.as his in
terests were,, bound up with those of his
followers. ' â¢ *'*'<

Dr. Dowie is worth possibly a million
and a quarter. He made it out of his
investments; He is ntit paid a salary.
Some of the "officials are paid a salary,
but- 1 decline to say what the amounts
are. That is a personal matter. /'
HOW DOWIE MADE MOXEY.
"Certainly," he replied. "I know of
many instances Â¦ where faith cured se
rious illness. We ' have- no practicing
doctors or drug .6tores4n-Zion City. A'
few months ago. a follower was injured
by a 1200-pouncl 'iron w-eisht' falling on
'. "m ~nd crushing his leg. An elder
prayed over him and the j bones fell
into place and the man -was quickly
cured. I did, not see the accident,* but
I knew the.man i and saw him after he
was cured." *? , - -â¢' ;,*Â¦;"
Newcomb was : then * asked if Dr.
Dowie could^cure .aijy person^in Sah
Francisco who might be : .unfortunate
enough to berun over an mangled by
a street car and" he replied : -Â¦ Â¦
"Not unless the injured person had
faith and then it would depend o: the
will of God."
Newcomb was then informed "that a
citizen of San '.Francisco had" offered
the suni of $10,000 in gold if Drl'.Dowie
could. cure any member ,of- his. church
who misfit be .injured. in ; a street car
or railroad accident and was asked if
Dowie would accept the offer. ' V.
"I do' not claim. that Dr. Dowie could
cure' such a case,"., he replied. '." "It
would all depend on the -vill of God."
"Dc. Dr." Dowie and his followers : fol-
"Do you and Dr. Dowie t believe that
faith will cure-sickness and: any acci
dent to the body ?"â was then. asked of

"When. a request was. made that Dow
ie be interviewed, his secretary. Arthur
W. Xewcomb, met the representatives
of the newspapers.
"Dr. Dowie is busily engaged in the
business of the church," said Deacon
Newcomb, "'but he says that if. the boys
will be good and write nice things
about him he may consent to grant an
interview to-morrow."
When Newcomb was asked if it was
not possible to secure information con
cerning the Zion City movement, he
replied: .* ' '. .
"Dr. Dowie has- asked me to-repre
sent him. I will answer all questions
for him and he wants you, to fully un
derstand that whatever I say is the
same as if he had said it." '
With this understanding Deacon
Newcomb replied to "many ; questions
put to him. He declared, that Dowie
had a following of 100,000 -in the world
ard that 10,000 were now living in Zidn
City, III..' which' is- rf6rty r tTvo miles
north of Chicago .on Lake Michigan.
Asked as to wliat Dowie's mission
really was, Newcomb replied:
"It is for the -benefit of the people of
the whole world: jWe are now preach
ing the gospel to the.people andt-teach
ing repentance, : restitution, salvation,
healing and nonliving;." '- :.
"What is the difference between'the
teachings <jf. Dr. .â¢ Dowie ; and those' of

the reply. .." *' s '..- . :i ":' . '".""

Three waiters were kept busy bring

PARTAKE OF $75 LIXCH.
James Alexander Dowie. who calls
himself "Elijah the Reformer" and
â¢Genera! Overseer 5 !' of "The Christian
Catholic Church Â«<f Zion."' arrived in
San Francisco yesterday morning on
a trip around the world. He will go

Leader of^New Sect Meets

licr Meeting,
Disorder, Marks Gather
ing at Alhambra
: Theater.
Dr. Dowie held a meeting last even
ing at tfie Theater, which
was attended by an audience composed
of those who believe in his teachings
and those who came there to scoff and
object. The theater was ai)out two
thirds filled andthe cold draughts that
swept through the building did not con
duce to comfort. " -
Dowie and his official staff appeared
on the platform about 7:30 and were
guppoited by some of the members of
4he local branch of- the Zion. Church.
Dowie presided at the meeting and
while his . associates were engaged at
the opening in singing, hymns he spent
his time in opening and reading letters.
Â¦ Dowie delivered a short address to
the gathering shortly after the^pening
in which he devoted himself exclusively
to the newspaper representatives pres
ent. Â¦ .' ' '
"I want you," he said, "to tell just
what happens here to-night. I don't
want you to say anything as to what
you think.* Tell r just what occurs here
to-night. I don't want your opinions.
The newspapers in New York Tied
about me. They told awful lies. Now
if you fellows down there will tell the
truth we will get along all right."
After the short; exhortation from
Dowie the audience sang a number of
hymns and then Dowie faced the au
dience while he held a copy of a book
in his hand which had been distributed
among, those present.
, DOWIE NEEDS THE BOOKS.
"We need these books in Australia,"
said Dowie, "and when you are through
.with them t to-night I want you to leave
them in your seats."
j Dowie then proceeded to call upon
those in the .audience who he claimed
had been cured by him during his pre
vious residence in this city. A number
of old men and. women answered the
call and stood up . in the body of the
building; Dowie asked them to -^step
up to the stage and they responded.,;
After. thirty-two old men and women
had crept up to the stage .Dowie pro
ceeded to question some of. the subjects.
He asked them as to their ailments and
prompted them to. tell how doctors had
failed to. cure, them of serious diseases
and how he, Dowie, had instantly cured
them by laying his hands on them and
playing over them.
The audience was' divided in its re
ception of the information presented by
Dowie. When he- asked, "Are you satis
fied?" there arose equal . shouts of
"Yes" and "No."
There was considerable disorder in
the" theater during the time that six
old women were questioned by Dowie.
He asked them to tell how they had
been "afflicted and cured. The old
women, some of them in faltering
tones that bespoke senility, informed
the audience that they . had suffered
from various ailments, including can
cer of'* the mouth, tuberculosis, ulcer
of the arm and severe nervous pros
tration, ?as well as internal hemor
rhages, that defied prominent medical
'men.
OLD WOMEN TELL STORIES.
Then the old women went on to tell
the audience! prompted by Dowie, that
when he, Dowie, had met them and
placed his hands, upon them they had
been instantly cured of their ailments
and that they had enjoyed many years
of good health since that time.
Dowie* who is a short and fat man,
lacking any personality or, magnetism,
and who speaks with ji pronounced
cockney accent, then strutted up and
down the stage. He waved his hands,
and, putting -his ~ glasses on his nose,
shouted in a. weak" voice^' :
â¢ "Are you satisfied with this evidence
of my powers?"
. Those who believed in the self-styled
Elijah replied. "Yes" and an equal
volume of "noes" arose from all parts
of the house. ,"*.>Â«:"
"ph, "you are not satisfied?" -said
Dowie.' "Will any one tell' me his rea
sons?"
â¢ A number of men arose in various
parts of the .building, and fired ques
tions at Dowie. The questioners claim,-,
ed that Dowie's curative powers might
be those of suggestion, or. that the sub
jects presented were senile or had an
object in testifying.;'*; â '
DOWIE IS INTERRUPTED.
"You shut up. Mr. Suggestion," said
Dowie to a man in the gallery, and
"you sit down, Mr. Doubtful,? he. said
to another â¢in the' orchestra.
"It is a shame and a disgrace," con-
tfnued Dowie. "that any one should
seek to disprove the evidence .pre
sented. What is that? You say 'that
one of the subjects had a brother who
was employed by me? Well, suppose
her brother was employed by me. He
was h faithful man. He has passed to
heaven and it is a shame and a dis
grace that you should come here and
scon!' at this lady or her -brother, who
served me faithfully. Sit down, shut
up; I am running this meeting. I wilf
teach you fellows to laugh. Don't you
think that you are running this meet
ing. Shut up or get out; I won't al
low any interruptions.!*
For two hours this sort of thing con
tinued. Dowie would question the old
women who claimed to have been cured
by him during his previous residence in
San Francisco. They would tell of
their ailments and their alleged cures
by Dowie, and when he asked it the
audience was satisfied - and . negative
answers would be given he would allow
no discussion, but order those who dfd
not believe to "shut ui" or "leave the
house*." â¢
AUDIENCE IS DIVIDED.
When -Dowie was asked as to his
recognition of "an allege ~ case of can
cer of the mouth, he answered:
'I recognized it by its smell. You
cannot mistake the tmell of a caso of
capcer. I -recognized it just as I rec
ognize the smell of a stinkpot to-night
in this audience. That is your an
swer; it. is sufficient for you. Now are
you satisfied?"
A volume of "noes" arose from all
parts of the theater and a number of
persons left the building.
Dowie paced up and down the plat
fcrm and cried out at the top of ; his
voice." " t
"The evidence Is too much for them,
that is why they are leaving. I don't
care for them. What do I c?re for
those who scon! at the word oZ God ?
Let me tell you about :i u n City. It 'Is
between beer and babel. Beer Is Mil
Â¦ .ukee and Babel is Chica-o. We
don'., have a drop of distilled fire or
liquid damnation; in Zion City. I came
hera to-night to answer th^ charges of
Rev. Dr. Bovard that I have nev :â¢
cured any'sickness by the laying on of
h Is. He has claimed th,at ever since
I have known his r.ame. I \3oi: t care
for doctors, either of the -uurch Sr the
medical profession. They all ccoff at
liny teachings." The medical doctors are
not needed in Zion City. "We djn't
want them to, bring bab'.:a in'.o the
world or to take babies 01. t of the
world." .
THE CRUSADE IX NEW YORK.
Dowie then proceeded to tell of his
recent crusade in New York City. He
declared that the crusade was a com
plete success and that he had not lost
any money, by the movement. :
. "My people," he said, "paid tjieir own
expense's, and: I spoke to 30,000 a day
and 100,000 could not gain entrance to
the hall. We intend to go back to New
York in 1905, and we will be 10,000
strong . instead of 3000.
â¢1 have never taken a cent* from my
followers for my services In the last six
years. I am the largest contributor, to
Zion City, because the Lord has : been
good to me." ! ' -Â¦ '
Dowie then closed his address by
saying he would speak agrain to-night
before he left to-morrow with his party
for Australia. - '
When Dowie and his party reached
the hotel they sought theirapartments
and refused to receive any person.
