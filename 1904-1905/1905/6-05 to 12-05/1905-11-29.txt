HOWISON SAYS ALL ANIMAL
LIFE IS IMMORTAL.
Now comes Dr. George H.
Howison, the eminent philoso
pher of the University of Cali
fornia, with a declaration to his
class that all animal life has the
reflective faculty qf mind and is
not guided altogether by in
stinct And intelligence and
mind, -wherever found, are im
mortal, asserts the savant
Philosopher Startles
Class With His
Statement.
Asserts Ljower torms
Have Reflective
â¢ Mind.
BERKELEY, Nov. 28.â The startling
declaration that animals have intelli
gence which corresponds to the reflec
tive faculty in man, and that this gives
the lower" orders "of creation" the right
to be regarded as immortal, created a
sensation in Professor George H. Howi
son's classroom at the -University' of
California this morning- and inspired a
buzz of tongues through the philosophy
building that did not subside until- the
â¢ place was deserted for the day.
Professor Howison barely escaped
making the declaration of belief that
animals have souls â immortal souls â ;
his statements regarding the. matter
leaving it to be inferred, as all of those
present did infer, that the distinguished
philosopher who addressed them has it
as part of his belief, that animals are
Immortal, that their intelligence is that
which will live forever, and that It is
man's Intelligence also A which is to in
sure his immortality.
The venerable philosopher's positive
statement that animals have mental
powers which enable them to reflect
and that such Intelligence is to be im
mortal as much so as human intelli
gence appeared to constitute a novelty
In philosophic thought and was so re
garded by Pro/essor Howison's class in
ethics.
BXrSTEXCK IS ETERXAL.
Professor Howison's remarks -on this
subject were In effect as follows:
"A nim.-il* have intellect, as do men. â¢
The difference in intellect consists -in
the difference in the hindrance to the
intellectual faculty. Increased Intelll
cence means Increased control, per
fected control. Do animals reflect as
man doÂ»-*f Undoubtedly -they do. If
they reflect then they have intelligence.
Oner It is admitted. that they have in
telligence then you juu*t admit that
they are to exlat eternally Jnst an
much aa you are to exist eternally.
Are animals capable of overcoming the
hindrance to their intellectual faculty?
1 answer yea."
N*o hint had been given by Professor
Howison. whose lectures on ethics attract
the greater part of the student body
which is philosophically inclined, that his
class to-day would be treated to so aen->
fx.tior.al a disquisition as was given dur
ing the hour when "Ethics" is discussed
by the aged philosopher. Evolution has
been the subject . matter of most of Pro-
Jessor Howison's philosophical lectures of
l&te. and It was upon evolution. that the
class to-day fixed its mind when Profes
, sor Howlscn began his address."
Scouting the. idea, entertained by some
epostles of evolution that consciousness
has been evolved 'from mere matter. Pro
fessor Howison proceeded to demonstrate
to-day that there always has . been con-
Eclousness â self-existing, eternal con
sciousness. Prom this phase of the sub
ject, which was not particularly, novel,
the university philosopher diverged .to a
discussion of .intelligence, as exhibited in
animals, and then came his radical decla
rationâradical to the young idea which
be was instructing, at least â that animals
have -reflective capacity which qualifies
them to be classed as reasoning beings,
with intelligence corresponding : to \u25a0 man's
Intelligence, the latter being assumed to
be immortal. hEB
RnUfJIOX OF BUDDHA.
. The. religion of Buddha -was cited by
Professor . Ho wisoa as an example of rec
ognition given "toy a great religious
teacher to the lower animals,' a recogni
tion nowhere granted by Jesus Christ;
Aionc does " tbe ; doctrine of Buddha :em ; '
brace a reebssrition of ..the- dignity of the
lower order of -animals/said Professor
Hoivison. A remarkable feature \u25a0 of
Christ'B teachings is that -ihey- Include no
reference to this, a - leading * phase of
Buddhism. . In this respect Buddha>may
be said " to . surpass * Chriet, i according : to
Howison, although > Buddha bad no \u25a0 such
conception of the immortality of the soul
and the dignity of the individual tuid the
Individual life, as did Jesus Christ/ Christ
in this respect grandly transcended the
Religious teacher^pf India.
The. Biblical story of'the serpent fin 'the
Garden of Eden, and the ; curse ;\u25a0 said Ho
have been-pronounced there upon, the !eer-*
pent, was smilingly referred to by Pro
fessor How ison, with the declaration' that

The general workmen's council has
Fuxnmoued a conference of the leaders
throughout the empire for to-morrow
to discuss the possibility of
& national strike in pympathy with the
locked out workmen of St. Petersburg.
There is a strong feeling against such a
strike, however, not only on account of
the poverty of the workmen, but also be
cause It would interfere with the great
eirike planned for January.
Professor Hodsky, editor of the Nasha
Shisn, called upon Premier de Witte to
demand permission for Father Gapon to
return to Russia.
"What is the use of deception among
frk-nds?'- said Count de Witte to thâ¬ pro

fpirit of Revolt Pervades tke ituÂ«Â»ian
Mtlllarj EstablUbment.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 28.â The mili
tary officials at St. Petersburg admit that
no reliance can be placed on the line regi
ments, not even on those now stationed
In the capital. According: to the officers
tlie spirC of revolt pervades the whole
army, from Vladivostok to the European
frontier. The Manchurian forces, they
add, are almost openly revolting. The
officers further point out that the state of
affairs at Sebastopol. Odessa, Slmferpol
3 nd Tiflls shows that the new revolution
ary spirit has spread to Southern Russia
and Trans-Caucasia.
The garrison of St. Petersburg has for
mulated a series of demands. Involving
the complete remodeling of the conditions
of service. The Manchurian army com
â¢plalns that It is not possible to exist In
Manchuria on peace pay and peace ra
tions, and that the wounded, thousands
of whom arÂ«Â» still detained in Manchuria,
are suffering untold tortures on account
of deficient medical resources. '-_:*,
There is grave doubt here whether Gen
eral Baron Mel'.er Gakoelskie, commander
of the Seventh Army Corps, who is in
charge of the Sebastopol situation, dare
put the soldiers to the test of firing on
their comrades.
It is significant, although the crews of
the local ships refused to Join the mu
tineers, they declined to carry out orders
to put to sea. This may indicate their
purpose to stand by and meet force with
force In the event of the soldiers and
Hrtillery ashore marching on the sailors*
barracks.
The reports from the Manchurian array
ere disquieting. Many officers and sol
illers. involved in the revolt at Harbin
have been arrested and a number of agi
tators who arrived there from European
Russia were caught red-handed by Gen
eral LJnevltch.
From Tifli* and Kars, Trans-Caucasia,
come reports that the soldiers are taking
a stand against firing on the people and
private dispatches from Odessa say the
*oldiersÂ» and sailors at a meeting held at
the university last night decided/in the
event of the Sebastopol mutineers bring
ing the Black Sea fleet to Odessa, to join
the mutineers and take possession of the
City.
The proprietors of estates In the dis
tricts affected by agrarian disorders are
afrnid to remain In their homes and are
flockin* to Moscow and St. Petersburg
by hundreds. The Novala Zeleb says that
many guns have been dispatched to the
disturbed districts. "

The Rosemount. It is 1 understood, is \u25a0 not
greatly damaged' and 'her crew. Is in little
dunger.. The, steamship Argo, jxrhlch went
aÂ»horo ; off Holland last Friday, was driv
en further on the beach by to-day's gale,
which was so , heavy, that It was - impos
sible to proceed with wrecking operations.
. The storm warnings on the lower. lakes,
which' have been up for.thÂ© past twenty
four hours, were ordered down at 6 o'clock
.to-night. 'From Alpena Â» north, to the
Upper Peninsula shore of. Lake Superior

enow was reported early, to-night. '
i The ' steamship Jim Sheriffs, which left
Alpena last night with the- barges Mowatt
and E. T. ; Judd In tow returned to that
to-night without her "barges and
with'one spar and her deck load of lum
ber, gone. The barges broke away _, In the
storm. \u25a0 An unknown barge -is at anchor
off Black River and Is supposed Ito be
the 'Mowatt. Nothing whatever has been
heard from | the E. T.t* Judd, and it Is
fearedUhat she may be lost. Captain Jex
of commands the Judd ! and has -a
crew of about eix.^.
* The steel steamship Charles M. Wer

portation Company ,-^of -Cleveland, ;'was
blown ' ashore, during the day on Nine-
Mile Point, near. Cheboygan; \u25a0 ;
V MILWAUKEE/.. N0v.. .28.â The . fiercest
wind In .Â« niany years prevailed on the
Great Lakes last night and to-day, causing
much damage to shipping and other prop
erty.. Lake Michigan on this shore was
a mass of foam and the water was driven
high : on the beach and against the clay
banks south and north of Milwaukee. On
Lake Michigan the wind reached a ve
locity of flf ty-slx miles an hour, but on
Lake ) Superior '.the .storm ; approximated a
hurricane," blowing sixty miles an hour.
/The Government lighthouse and fog sig
nal building at the end of the Milwaukee
breakwater pier was battered by the
high. seas and the assistant keeper, Wil
liam Foster, was rescued !with difficulty
by.; the life-savers. '> The entire east wall
of .the - fog-signal building was 'smashed
m^by the -waves, which, according * to
Foster, were the worst he had ever seen
in his fifteen gears' experienc.
The big steamship Appomattlx, coal
laden, which went : a3hore seven miles
north of this city several' weeks ago, and
wan, later abandoned, waa battered to
pieces by the Intensity of the waves. Bow
and stern were washed away and driven
upon the shore. \u25a0 Wreckage strews ' the
shore" of. the- lake from Lake Park to
Whitefish-Bay.
. Port; Washington, thirty miles north of
Milwaukee, reports ' that the steamshfp
D. C. Whitney, ! # coal laden, ran ashore
during; the gale/ The vessel belongs to
the Gilchrist fleet of Cleveland. The Mil
waukee life saving crew went to the res
cue, and this afternoon took the crew off
in safety. Two Milwaukee tugs also went
to the scene and. will endeavor to release

OF THE "EVIL EYE."
That the "evil eye" superstition is prevalent in a marked degree among the Italians in the Latin quarter of
this city was the development yesterday at the inquest held on the death of .Catherine De P3OH, who was brutally
slain by her brother-in-law. Testimony showed that this weird belief drove the crazed man to commit the crime.
MURDERER OF MRS. CATHERINE DE PAOLI AS HE APPEARED YESTERDAY AT THE INQUEST 'HELD TO DETERMINE THE 1
CAUSE OF HIS VICTIM'S DEATH. AND THE YOUNG DAUGHTER OF THE DEAD WOMAN TESTIFYING BEFORE THE
CORONER'S JURY. '\u2666\u25a0 > I
"The superstition regarding the "evil
eve' Ss very corumon In our own Latin
cjuarter 10-cay." said Autopsy Surgeon
Bacfgalupl at the inquesi held on the
Â£eath of Mrs. Catherine Dc Paoli yes
terday. "'The belief is that certain per
fous are- v_>Â£*essed with demons and
have the power to caus.^ disease, and
111 luck for others. Th*> belief is very
prevalent anjoner the Ignorant Italians
of thi* city."
From the testimony yesterday it was
shown conclusively that Louis de Paoli
end his wife were thoroughly convinced
that Catherine De Paoll had the "evil
â¢ye," and that s>he intended to do harm
to their children and themselves.
The Jury found that Catherine "came
to her death from shock and
hemorrhage â multiple compound frac
ture of the ukull, caused by being struck
over the head by one Louis DÂ« Paoli
\u25a0with a chair and with- intent to kill."

No reference was made by the jury, to
the murderer's mental condition.
The inmost savored somewhat of .t
harking back to the witchcraft days
in Salem. De Faoli sat in the Inquest
room handcuffed, his ashen lips occa
sionally moving in prayer to the phan
tom.Â« his diseased mind created. While
the prisoner sat staring with. bloodshot
eyes at the wraiths his mania conjured
up before him his little son lay sleep-
Ing peacefully with an Innocent smile
on hi? baby face in the rear of the
room. As the police led the demon
ridden father away, he touched the lit
tle one's face caressingly with his
manacled hands and held his arms over
him, as though he would shield him
from the unseen devils.
Stoicism Is apparently one of the
traits of the De Paoll family. Mary de.
Paoli, the daughter of the murdered
woman, told of the incidents', that oc
curred Jnst before the weird \igil and
the ghastly crime without a tremor in
her voice.' Antone de Paoli, husband
of the victim, told his story without
showing a trace of emotion.
MARY I)E PAOLI'S STORY.
Mary De Paoll said: "On Thursday
my uncle and aunt came to our house
and asked that we pray for them. My
father told them to come in and sit
down. My uncle, wanted to know if
he owed anybody anything. He said
he wanted to pay it. Then he said he
wanted to pray, and asked my mother
and father if they would go , to church.
"My mother said there was no; need
of that. 'You can "pray Just as \we!l
here.' she said. But my' uncle : said
that he must go to chjirch, so we all
went. They had come to the house
only partly dressed, and: my. father had
to .go back ' to their place for,- their
coats. They were afraid to go back."
"Did they seem crazy then?" asked
Coroner Le land. , â¢
"No: they seemed to be all right; but

.Milwaukee and St.' Paal Railroad Com
pany, the board formally authorized the
building v 1 \u25a0 the ; St. I'aul ex tension to
the Pacific Coast from Evarts. South

Â»peelfled In the official nnnounoement
that the nork o.' cooMrurtlun was to
begin forthwith. It is estimated that
the cost will be about $30,000,000.
;It was dnounced at the close of , the
meeting that as yet no plans had been
determined upon for financing the pro
ject. This problem, in all probability^
will be decided upon at a meeting: of
the executive committee'to-morrow. It
is understood that an issue of convert

an' increase in the road's capital stock,
ab0ut: 525,000,000 of which is still un
issued. . ;
Preparations already have been
made for the Incorporation of a new
railway* company from Evarts, which,
however, will be entirely financed by
the St. Paul. â¢ - .
While all the details of the route
have not ' been : decided upon, the line
will run toward 'the Rocky. Mountains

it will be* extended westerly, crossing
the Bitter Root Mountains through Lo
lo Pass and ultimately connecting with
Wallula, Wash.,; the terminus of the
"recently incorporated Pacific Railroad.
which runs to that point from- Seattle.
The St. Paul will also seek an outlet
at Tacoma and will' touch Helena, Spo
kane and Portland.
The work of construction will be be
gun simultaneously at Seattle, on the
Pacific road, and at Evarts. The line
farther south, which is in the -course
of construction from Chamberlain, 'S.

a 200-mile^ project, also will . be "con

that she Is the wife of, Henry. E- Hunt

possession of his palatial offices in the
Huntington '. building ' and proceeded to
act as if she; owned the place. She had
been ' there many times during the 'past
week, but had not ' attempted to enter.
To-day, however, she stated that she had
been kept 'out long : enough, and once
reaching Mr.'.Huntington's private offices
she refused to^vacate. She gave orders
to stenographers and clerks and asserted
that she had been told to run the Hunt
lngton railways ; until- Mr. Huntington's
return. It was manifest, that : she was
insane and the, authorities were notified.
When the police arrived. the .woman re
fused to vacate, and not desiring to use
force the officers led her to believe that
her presence was needed at some point
on ; one of the â¢ railway , lines. She was
placed in a closed carriage and taken to
a hospital, where she will remain until
the courts pass upon her sanity.
The unfortunate woman is the, divorced
wife of E. E. Crandall, a wealthy dry
goods '< merchant. Her home is in Long
Beach, and it is said that her domestic
troubles which led the divorce de
throned her reason. For a long time it
has been known that she was of unsound
mind, but only once before to-day wa3
restraint necessary. Soon after Chief of
Police Hammer resigned the woman ap
peared : at the police station- and an
nounced that she had been elected Chief
of Police and was ready to begin her
duties. She was locked up. but later
friends came for Her.
Her action to-day will result in a com
plaint for Insanity being preferred against
her. Huntington was not informed of her
presence until after she had been placed
under arrest.

Walter Camp, the well known football

action taken by Columbia University.
He said: '\u25a0'\u25a0 - "\u25a0\u25a0'.- 'r: :
The time has ccroe when some action must be
taken modifying the style of the present college
football game. As long as a, year ago I.an
nounced myself In favor or an alteration In the
rule 3 governing the game. I believe a rule
compelling the carrying of the ball ten yards
f<v threÂ« downs will ultimaiÂ«ly prove the eolu-
Tlon of the obnoxious elements of college foot
ball, and I sincerely believe that the time is
noar at hand when either this rule will be
adopted universally or eorr.e other means will
be. decided, upon whereby all danger â¢ to thÂ«
player will be eliminated. . .':..-

Fanciful Enterprise, but
His Checks Are Honored
and lie Over $200,000
/...Special Dispatch to The CaII. r# ; -
CHICAGO. Nov. 2S.â Samuel ,' N.^Hoff
heimer, a nephew of. Nelson -Morris, the
millionaire packer, was arrested'here to
night charged with having swindled S.
W. Strauss & Co., mortgage bankers at
114 La Salic street, out of $256,000. Being
unable to furnish bonds, fixed at $150,000
by Justice ' Cochrane, . who Issued the
warrant for his arrest, Hoffheimer was
taken to the Ccok County Jail. . "'\u25a0.
The alleged swindle operated by Ho'ff
heiriier extends over. a period of eighteen
months. His relations with the Morris
fanliiy, it is said, made it possible for
Hoffheimer" to carry out the scheme for
such a long . period without detectiori.
Two years ago, while the young man was
carrying on a small 'commission business
in buying . and j selling cattle feed, it is
alleged he went to S. W. \ Strauss & Co.
and explained that' he was buying large
quantities of cotton seed and cotton- seed
hulls, which, he disposed -of to , Nelson
Morris & Co. In. order "to carry on. the
business, it Is alleged, he explained: that
a large amount of money, was necessary,
to take up the -drafts which were made
daily l on him for.the .feed and -to v take
up the bills of lading made with the. ship
ments. He, ft is said, reauested S. W.
Strauss & Co. to finance the deals, which
they agreed to do.- . .-
Froto that time on, it is alleged, Hoff
heimer delivered lists to Strauss & Co.
daily of carloads of cattle feed which
he said he had; bought from .various con
cerns and had Eold to Nelson Morris &
Co. .He would obtain; checks for the
amount of , his purchases from S. .W.
Strauss '& Co.", arid at the same time he
would deliver to the bankers. a draft on
Nelson Morris : & ' Co. ; for, the amount
for .which he had inforriied them' he had
sold the feed ' to* the packing company.
The .draft taken' by the; bankers was de
posited in theirbanks In the usual course
of their business. '. '. \u0084' yi .
At the beginning, according 'to the
bankers, . Hoffheimer. carried on \u25a0" only
small . sales,^but I . the amounts of; the
transactions grew* so that sales to Nelson
Morris & Co., as reported by; Hoffheimer,'
amounted to more than t $150,000: a day:
Until the first of this month the supposed
sales continued and then' it'. was learned,
it Is said. " .tfia't 'allTthe- sales "; were .flctir
tlous! Instead \u2666of taking", up the drafts
which he had said were made out against
him when fie" bought the supposed feed,
Hoffheimer \u25a0 took "up the drafts, which \u25a0he
gave to S. W. Strauss. &- Co., against
Nelscn Morris & Co. In 'â¢ that way he
continued, from day . to ? day, increasing
his ' sales': and - taking up â¢ the
larger drafts against the, x packing com
pany . with the larger . check given him by
the ' bankers? each : followlng A day, . making
a srnaHgain" each;dayon:the f use of the
bankers' money. \ ' ." H ".' ':
Knowledge of the drafts' did not -reach
the packing company, until November, 1,
when Nelson. Morris accidentally-discov
ered one check while â¢It was , in ; the i bank
at the stock â¢ yards. : An | Investigation fol
lowed 'and Hoffheimer > is alleged to have
made ' a^ ' complete confession to , S trauss of

een months he had-b'een carrying on the
scheme which had made him a living and
at( the close had netted j him $256,000,; trie

dence. He rang the bell and gave his
professional card to the butler, who.
after a while, reported that Rogers haa
left the house five minutes before Pal
mido called.
Palmido left the house, but waited
down the block a little way and he
coon saw Rogers appear on the steps
with a etout. heavy set man walking
beside him. At the same moment an
automobile drove hurriedly up and
halted in front of the house. The pro
cess server hurried up and met Rogers

"Isn't this Mr. Rogers?" he asked
pleasantly.
The heavy set man got between Pal
mido ar.d Rogers; the door of the car
riage was Quickly opened and Rogers
grot in, the big guard closing the door
quickly behind him.
Palmldo saw that a window in the
cab was open and through It he tossed
the order of the subpena. It landed on
Rogers' lap. and in order that all might
be complete Palmldo threw $2 50 into
the financier's carriage. As he did so
he called Rogers' attention to the orig
inal signature of Judge Fitzgerald on

i WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â The. -\ ad
ministration dashed the hopes "of- the
little band of American colonists on
tbe Iso of Pines, who have been work-.
Ing toward the separation of the Island
from Cuba and Its inclusion In .. the
United "States, when Secretary. Root,
after consultation with the President,
addressed a letter to Charles Raynard,
president of the American Club of . the
Isle of Pines, denning the attitude 'of
the United States Government toward
the proposed formation of a territorial
government in the Islands asf part uof
the United States. The Secretary was
most pointed in the statements in his
letter.which In part Is as follows:
I have received your letter' of October 25, In
which you Â»y, "Kindly advise me at your
earlieet convenience the necessary procedure
to establish a territorial form of. government
for thÂ»> Isle of Pines. West Indies, U. S. A.\*.
It le not part ot the duty. of the \u25a0 Secretary
of State to give advice upon such subjects. I
think It proper, however, to answer your In
quiry so far as It may be necessary to remove
an error under, which you appear to be resting
concerning the status of the Isle cf Pines and
your rights as residentr of that island.
There is no procedure by which you and
your associates can lawfully establish a terri
torial government in that island. The island is
lawfully subject to the control and govern
ment of the republic .of Cuba, and you and
your associates are bound to render obedience
to the laws of that country co long as you re
main In the Island. If you fall in that obe
dience yoo will justly be liable to prosecution
in the Cuban courts and to such punishment
as may be provided by the laws of Cuba.
The treaty, now pending before the Senate, if
approved by that body, will relinquish all
claim of the United States to the Isle of
Pines. In my judgment the United States has
no substantial claim to the Isle of Pines. The
treaty merely accords to Cuba what is hers In
accordance with International law and justice.
You may be quite sure that Cuba will never
consent to Rive up the Isle of Pines and that
the United States will never: try to compel her
to give It up against her, will. *

James Crovvlmrst Afraid of
His Life. Refuses to Tes
tify Against Former Pals
WARNED BY PRISONERS
After Trial by "Kangaroo
Court" Youth Says He Will
Not Go on the Stand
OAKLAND, Nov. 28. â Threatened
with death by his fellow-convicts If he
testifies against his former pals, James
Crowhursi, who was brought back here
from Folsom prison to give evidence
Hp.-ilr.st Percy Pembroke and John
Schneider, says that he will refuse to
testify, ;inÂ«l rather than do so and again
face his mates in the cells he. would
throw himself from the train that take*
him back. He says that be was tried
before .the "Kangaroo Court" at Fol
rom after giving: evidence against
George Blaker. and barely cleared him
self from conviction by the jurors in
stripes. Half of the men with whom
he has to associate have refused to
* peak to him. while the fear of the hid
den knife, he says, has caused him
great unrest. The young prlsonei
Â£poke as follows to-day:
pÂ«iÂ«ox holm; tkuhok.
People outside know nothing of what Ukee
place inside arisen walls. There are men then
who do not care lor anything. The stick of the
lr!>. ftne or oae'a tobajsco. the leaving of a
Â«nan without any one to talk to are some of
â¢their ways of making people there obey thflr
rules. One at a time men will come to you
and fay they . understand such is ' the case.
Then another will com* and tell you something
differern. you will be asked by dozens of ihem
and (hen they compare notes and come to a
conclusion. .
IVbea 1 got back to Folsom after testifying
here in the Hlaker rase they already had the
news and half of the men in the sang I am
in will not speak to me. They had it that I
eaxne back here to testify against my own
brother and I think were ready to give mt.
the limit. .1 managed to explain that it wan
tot my brother, but another fellow who had
â¢â¢squealed" on me. They are not satisfied,
however, and when 1 ttÂ»ft thin time they tcld"
BiÂ« If I valued my ure to forget all I knew
and refuse to tell anything, and you bet I
will . do it. I am more afraid of them than
the court*. 'â. y
On* of the rules of the prisoners Is that no
one inside shall tell anything to help get any
one t-lrt In. They don't care If it is an enemy
or friend. You have got to take your spite out
en him in some other way than to testify
against him. and it is a terrible thing to be
among such a band of men if they once get
am-r you. One of the worst things & fellow
can do is to take the etand against any one
and 1 don't tntend to take any chances. It
they put me on th* rtandl shall eimply say
that my memory has gone back on me' and
that I have forgotten everything I ever knew
up to the tune I went to Jail a few weeks ago.

Crowhurst was brought back here
from Folsom to* contradict the" testi
mony of George Blaker In case he took
the Etand and testified In favor of
Percy Pembroke, whose trial Is now in
progress. The taking of testimony in
the case, however, was closed to-day
without Blaker' s being put on the
â¢'and and the rumor is that Blaker.
while telling one story to Attorney
Linchurch for Pembroke was prepared
to tell an entirely different one when
he took the stand and that his double
dealing was suspected and he was
therefore not called.
Blaker's true story is said to be radi
cally different from that told by
Schneider and Pembroke and he says
that when Cook was struck he threw
the sack of coin he was carrying to
the ground and while the three youths
scrambled for It he made his way" home,
but was wounded so grievously* by the
bludgeons that he died from the effects
of the blows.
The arguments were begun in the
Pembroke caee to-day and will be com
pleted to-morrow. Crowhurs,t will
probably be held over for the trial of
Schneider next month. . .

swerving of the machine on a slippery bit
of road; J.Fletcher Sims, the son of John

4 o'clock this afternoon on the San Lean-;

D.>: Hamlin:. -It "is f believed ahat he sus
tained a: fracture of the skull at the base
or the brain, and small hope is" 1 expressed
for his. recovery. *
- Sims â¢ was enjoying a run . to Hay wards
with l a party, of friends, and had reached
the corner of Bryant street and the \u25a0\u25a0 San
Leandro road, two blocks east- of 'High
street. "when the automobile swerved
quickly .to the side of the road* throwing
Sims "forward out of the machine.* "V In
falling he s struck ' the roadway squarely
bri'hla head, and /when picked up by. the
other members ; of the party, was uncon
scious.. ' â¢ '
. He was hurriedly taken to the ; office of
Dr. Jo Hamilton, at High and East Four
teenth; streets, and after an examination
the: physician ordered that ; the ,-> lnjured
man be put to bed in a room at Charles
Harrison's I hotel pending his removal to
his home. Dr.' Hamilton applied restora
tives, but 'the injured man failed to re
spond to the treatment. Only once did he
rally \u25a0 and make ( an effort'- to speak, j but
the exertion was too much for him, and
he relapsed at once into unconsciousness.
Dr. Hamilton, after doing everything pos
sible, for the patient, sent for. Dr. O. D.
Hamlln, Sims': family, physician. . ; :
> Finding that 81ms was dangerously in
jured,* Dr. Hamlin at once ordered his re
moval to Providence Hospital, and on' his
arrival there every effort, was made to
restore him to consciousness.. but without
avail, and at a late hour to-night he was
still in the same f condition as when picked
up./,-'.: . ..\u25a0 : -,\u25a0"â¢'â¢ \u25a0-, . . \u25a0\u25a0 ':,:->,fti U-yj/Jy V.
.When picked up blood was flowing ; from
his right ear and there was a large bruise
on the right side of the head? Dr. Hamil
ton believes that his skull "was "fractured
at;? the- base of } the*brain. After *Â« his .ex
amination . \u25a0'- of the patient to-night | Dr.
Hamlin : said 'that ; Sims', - condition indi
cated that this was the case. He said
that should Sims not '-"rally.. in _ the course
of a| few. hours hjs chances for recovery
would ' be very' small. L *
This is : the second automobile: accident
In* which: Sims has been involved 'within

PLANS A NOVEL
ISLAND HOME
Wiclow of Inventor of Win
chester Bitle Purchases a
Large Tract in f San Mateo
IS TO ERECT CASTLE
Her House to Be an. Imi
tation of the Beautiful
Baronies of Feudal Times
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I SAN* MATEO, Ndv. 28.â A great deal
of interest has been aroused- here by
j the purchase 6t several hundred
acres of valuable land by -~ra. Win
chester. \u25a0 widow of the Inventor of the
Winchester rifle. It is the purpose of
Mrs. Winchester .to create an island
out of her purchase and to erect upon
it one of the most unique estates in
California, one that will be an imita
tion of the beautiful baronies of. feu
dal times.
Mrs. Winchester already possesses
a magnificent bungalow on the. shore
of the bay opposite Burlingame sta
tion. This she will make practically
the center of her new and strangely
attractive domain. She has bought
hundreds of acres of land which ex
tend northward from her present hold
ing to ' the dairy opposite the eastern
subdivision. In this tract Is Included
the old and well-known Lamphtsre
place.
It is announced upon authority that
Mrs. Winchester intends to have a,
canal due: around the entire tract,
thus rendering her property an Island,
upon which her ideas of a remarkable
country estate may have full scope for
development. Under the scheme of con
struction as now outlined entrance to
the grounds may be obtained , only
across a drawbridge, which, may bÂ«
raised or lowered at the command of
the mistress of the placÂ«. :..\u25a0'--.-. .
It has also been planned to throw up
a huge mound on the side of the prop
erty nearest to the electric road. Upon

Judge W. W. Morrow and Mrs. Mor
row departed last night for Washington.
Â£>â¢ C, to attend the annual convention of
the National Red Cross Society, which
opens In that city next Tuesday. They
will be Joined by Mrs. L. I* Dunbar, also
a delegate from California, who is now
In the East.
The American National Red Cross, per
manently organized .unCer the recent act
of Congress and the international treaty
of Geneva, will hold Its first annual ses
sion in Washington on December 5. Hor
ace Davis and Judge Morrow of this city
are the national lncorporators of the so
ciety representing the Pacific Coast. The
other incorporators, representing differ
ent sections of the country, include such
notable persons as Judge William H.
Taft, Secretary of War; Admiral George
Dewey; Justice Day of the Supreme
Court, Secretary of State under President
McKlnley; Richard Olney, Secretary of
State under President Cleveland; John
W. Foster, Secretary of State under

to England; Margaret Carnegie. Mary A.
Logan, Mabel T. Boardman, Robert T.
Uncoln, John G. Carlisle, Lambert Tree,
Marshall Field, Redfleld Proctor and oth
ers of like standing.
TAFT IS DIRECTING.
The president of the society Is Judge
William H. Taft, appointed, as' required
by law, by the Preeldent of the United
States. For the purpose of maintaining
a governmental supervision over the af
fairs of the society the President is also
required to appoint as officers of the gov
erning body a representative from each
of the departments of State, War. Navy,
Treasury and Justice, which has* been
done.
The purpose of the corporation Is to
furnish volunteer aid to the sick and
wounded in the service of the armies and
navies In time of war, as provided by
international treaties, and In time of
peace to continue and carry on a system
of national and International relief, and
apply the same in mitigating the suffer
ings caused by pestilence, famine, fire,
floods and other great calamities, and to
devise and carry on measures for pre
venting and preparing for such calami
ties.
The great benefit of the organization In
time of peace is to be In rendering
prompt, suitable and effective aid and
relief in great emergencies, avoiding the
delay otherwise incident to the formation
of committees collecting funds after the
calamity has occurred-
ACCOUNTS ARE INSPECTED.
Another feature of the society under the
law is its accountability. The itemized
accounts of the society for all funds re
ceived and disbursed are required ' to be
carefully examined and audited by the
War Etepertxnent,' and a full and com
plete report of the proceedings of the
society, including the audited accounts,
transmitted to Congress annually.
The California branch of the national
organization has elected to the national
convention, which meets In Washington
on December 6, Mrs. William W. Morrow
and Mrs. L. L. Dunbar, to represent the
State whose original organization ren
dered such splendid service during the
Spanish War as to attain a national repu
tation, under the able management of
Mrs. Wlllard B. Harrington, State presi
dent; Mrs. John F. Merrill, presidept of
the San Francisco Society, and their as
sociates throughout the State. These
original organizations having been merged
Into the present national society, the his
tory of California's generosity will be
come a continuous record from April,
ISSS, when the first Red Cross society was
organized, and which at -one time had
11,000 members.
Another Storm Approaches.

yesterday near the mouth of the Co

BRINGS HIM TO TOWN.
Shows Him to Pleased AudienGe
CHARACTERISTIC DRAWING BY THE FAMOUS ARTIST WHO DELIVERED ONE
OF HIS HIGHLY ENTERTAINING LECTURES LAST NIGHT IN LYRIC HALL,
ILLUSTRATING HIS STORIES IN HIS OWN CLEVER WAT
Buster Brown and Tlge came across the
bay yesterday. Pleased? They were
tickled to death. ' .
"My! look at the gulls, Tlge; we haven't
seen gulls since we, left New York; but,
oh. Tlge, doesn't this town take the cake?
Look at this bay. No wonder they're
proud of this place."
Buster had juet gasped out the last
word when they heard a band playing,
and gains to the other side of the ferry
boat, they saw the Chicago lying there
coaling.
"Pshaw!" said Tlge. "The Chicago
ought to be ashamed to put In here,
where the Oregon was built."
"No. no, ,Tige; you're wrong," broke In
Buster. "The Chicago came In here to
show them how proud they ought to be.
Besides, Tige, we are all Americans; why
should any American try to vie with any
other when we are all doing our best,
and that's the best there is?"
"Good," said Tlge, "you are there with
the" argument, afe usual, Buster."
"Why not?" said Buster. "Am I not an
American boyâ and, say, Tige, If this San
Francisco isn't enough to make me
proud of my country? my name isn't Bus
ter Brown."
In a window on the north side of the
SC Francis sat Tlge and Buster all yes
terday afternoon resting after a long
Journey, admiring the view and discours
ing on the dignity of Nob Hill. \
Richard Outcauit, whose creative fancy
brought Buster, his sweetheart, Mary
Jane, and Tlge Into the world to gladden
the real little children throughout the
country, told- all about .the advent of
Buster and the other two at Lyric Hall
last night to an audience of big and small
people that laughed and applauded with
great frequency and went away filled
with delight pj.pd
"When I first saw Tige," said Mr. Out
cauitâand he said it with such retrospect-.
tve sincerity that â¬Very little one present
became convinced that Tlge had really
existed and grown from, a funny baby
dog to the comedian that helped Buster
carry but his pranks â "he was a very
serious-appearing little dog, believing
then that the world was serious, and he
looked like this," and the- picture of a
solemn-visa ged doggy went on the can
vas, making young and old alike snicker.
Then came a picture ' of red-cheeked
Mary Jane, with her engaging grin,' and
next a succession of pictures of Buster,
showing him as a very little fellow,* "as
the artist first knew him," and as the
arch mischief maker that the American
public la so familiar with. The children
all grew to believe that Buster, Mary
Jane and Tlge exist somewhere in the
flesh, and it is not certain that their
creator has not come to look upon them
as real beings.
Mr. Outcauit Is a clever story teller,
and did as well in that line as many a
star In vaudeville. His story of his "own
struggles and how he studied the town
characters^of his native burg, from whom'
he drew much inspiration, greatly amused
his hearers.
The famous cartoonist also depicts his
"Yellow , Kid." :. The cartoons are given
away to the audience. He will appear
again" to-morrow night and Friday night,
and at matinees every remaining day of
the week, except Friday.

ITiE SAN FRANCISCO > CALL, WEDNESDAY;.' NOVEMBER "20, 1905.
WILL CONNECT
EUREKA LINES
Direct Road to the Northern
Port Assured After Long
Conference of the Chiefs
The San Francisco and Northwestern
Railway, which has a line built south
from Eureka to Camp Five, thirty-seven
miles, will soon . begin the construc
tion of the- continuation of the road
to Sherwood, \ the northern terminus
of the California Northwestern Railway,
where the two roads will Join for mutual
benefit and run cars through from Eureka
to San Francisco. This will give San
Francisco a direct communication by rail
to this northern part, and will - open up
a large section of the country which has
hitherto been without suitable means of
transportation. The construction of this
new line means much to Eureka and to
the small towns along the line, as well as
to San Francisco.
Although the announcement that this
work is to be done has not been. officially
made, yet It comes from sources close, to
the heads of both railways, and Its au
thenticity is , not : to" be doubted. The
agreement came a,fter a long consultation
between the officials of the Santa Fe,
which road Is the owner of the San. Fran
cisco and Northwestern Railway, and the
chiefs of the California Northwestern,
said to be owned by the Southern Pacific.
By the agreement the Santa Fe is re
lieved from the heavy task, of building a
line on the steep grades and- through tha
rocky passes of the northern mountains.
The two roads believed that the prospec
tive traffic did not warrant duplicate lines
and the compromise was therefore effect
ed. The California Northwestern Is saved
the expense of building from Sherwood
Into Eureka. ' : The ; distance to be con
structed Is fifty-one miles. ~

ADDRESS ALT. COMMUNICATIONS TO
aOHX McNAUGHT .Manager
PUBLICATION OmCE...: ..THIRD. AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
WEDNESDAY : NOVEMBER 29, 1905
PUT THE WIRES UNDERGROUND.
THE United Railroads of San Francisco has by enterprise done
a great work for the expansion and development of the city.
Communication has been made easy and cheapened between all
parts of the town, and perhaps no city of the size of this has as
good a system of surface transportation. Its use is cheaper, to the
people than the usex>f the municipal owned street railways of Glas
gow. There is something to be desired in the way of improved
equipment, but the enterprise of the company will doubtless over
lake the demand for it within a reasonable time. The people are well
disposed toward the corporation, and inclined to frown upon the
pestiferous demagogy which flies at it, yelping.
It is very desirable for the . interests of the city and of the
corporation that these good relations be increased rather than di
minished. A warfare that has a small beginning, as a rule, gathers
proportions and force as it sweeps onward and ends by hurting all
parties to it. Under the circumstances it, will be unwise for the cor
poration to precipitate a conflict over the motive power of the Sutter
street road. If a change be made to electric power, the wires should
go underground, unless there is some insoluble engineering problem
in the way.
The tendency of the time is to put all electric wires under
ground. It is true that the municipality of Glasgow iis*es the over
head wire on its street railroads and offers objections, to the subway
that seems sufficient for it, but in Washington City the corporation
that owns the street railroads without compulsion and of its own mo
tion put its Wires underground, and its system works without, a
hitch. The demand for underground wires seems reasonable on its
face, and if the corporation refuse it is incumbent upon it to prove
that the demand is unreasonable.
THE NATION'S BENEVOLENCE.
a SPECIAL report on benevolent institutions has just been
l\ issued by the' Bureau of the Census. It is a feature of the
*\u25a0 *\u25a0 report that the establishment of orphanages, hospitals and
temporary homes for need}' persons results largely from private
initiative. We now have 4207 such institutions, and out of these
only 485 are supported by the Federal Government, the States or
other civil divisions. Religious denominations provide, for 1363
and private corporations manage 2359.
It is readily seen from these figures to what a large extent the
unfortunates of the community are dependent upon the charitable
emotions of individuals, or of organizations of groups of individuals
which are only fractions of the whole civic organism; . In our chari
table work we are in a condition of neither being a complete social
organism nor is our system distinctly individualistic. Our methods
are quite mixed, and while it may be in some sense advantageous and
at least temporarily expedient to have it so because of such a varied
system's flexible adaptability, it is nevertheless liable to be the cause
of the evil of much neglect. For the reason that we act on large
questions to a great extent as a social organism, many individuals
will have the impression that their charitable duties are attended
to for them through the mechanism of the social organism of which
they form a law-abiding, conscientious and tax-paying part. A con
sideration of the statistics, 'however, will quickly show that we are
as yet very far from being so thoroughly constituted a social organ
ism that a man may regard his charitable obligations as being, so
wholly delegated to civic initiation and control as not to need his
personal attention. In that way our half-and-half .condition of social;
organization is apt to confuse the individual's ethics by the dangerous
sophism the half truth.
It is true we can pass muster as a humane and highly civilized
people, caring kindly for our orphans, our sick, helpless and other
afflicted, and decently keeping suffering from giving public evidence
of communal willful neglect; but that is due mainly to groups of
individuals, who act independently of the civic organism which by
some persons is held to assume entire responsibility. The lesson of
the report on benevolent institutions seems from the figures given to
be that we must give interest and support to private and to church
institutions, for the Federal, State and civic divisions are plainly not
yet able or ready to care-for all the unfortunates who need. aid.
WOMEN AS A POLITICAL FORCE.
VIRTUAL possession of the franchise may become a real priv
ilege of American women without their ever having or exer
cising the privilege of voting at elections. . Strong evidence of
this exists in the recent triumph of Jerome in -New York when he
showed himself greater than parties. There seems a great. likelihood
that the women are due much of the credit for electing him. They
conducted an enthusiastic campaign for him. They sent out a mil
lion copies of a pamphlet telling "Why Women Back Jerome," arid
postal cards by the hundred thousand, /written in seven different
languages, with instructions how to vote a split ticket.
The victory for civic righteousness in Philadelphia is also said
to be in large measure due to the efforts of the women of the Quaker.
city. They accomplished this work through their ward civic-better
ment associations. It has always been presumed that -Women, could
largely influence elections by persuasionVbf rrien of their immediate
households; but these recent experiences of big elections seem to
demonstrate that they exercise an incalculable influence over the
mass of voters.
It is said that the work doneby -the women of Philadelphia was
most skillfully planned. They worked by parlor meetings and public
meetings, and # they distributed tons of literature. They requested
clergymen to "preach sermons on civic righteousness, and sent
\v?Â»gons to patrol the streets with signs telling the voters important
truths. Added to this was their direct appeal to fathers, brothers,
husbands and sons to vote against candidates who were tainted with
corruption. Thus it^was shown that virtue in civic affairs can
without doubt be promoted by women even though they do riot ac
tually vote, and therein is a large field of work for them whether
they go further into questions. of state policy or not

PONY EXPRESS.
The world's record for organized and
"schedule" riding was made by the pony
express. Never before nor since has mail
been carried so fast, so far 'and so long
merely .by horse power; and If I am not
in error, never elsewhere have horses
been so steadily spurred In any regular
service.. The pony express carried mail
between the East and California (at f5
per half-ounce) for about two years. It
ran from Independence to San Francisco,
1930 miles. Its time was ten days," and it
never needed eleven. It employed- 500 of
the fastest horses that could be found, of
course all Western horses, 200 station
keepers and eighty riders.' It had 190
stationsâ crowded down the throat of the
wilderness, 'sixty-ftve to one hundred
miles (or even more) apart, according as
water chanced. The rider was allowed
two minutes to change hprses and mails
at a . station.
William F. Cody. "Buffalo Bill." was
the most famous of the pony express
riders, and as a 14-year-old "kid" got
his flrst "job" from the man. that invent
ed the pony express. Cody "madÂ© the

BLUE RIBBONS
Expert Judges Have a Harc\
Time Selecting Winners
Among Well Bred Birds
LARGE CROWD ATTENDS
California State Poultry Ex
hibition at the Ferry
Attracts Many People
it was nearly as hard yesterday for
the judges to select the blue ribbon
winners at the California State Poultry
Inhibition as it usually it. to pick win
ners at a baby snow. Fowls of high
Lreed, which failed to yet any recogni
tion from the judges, cast their heads
downward with disgust and refused to
cackle or crow during the day, while
their next door neighbors, whose cages
rv ere draped with winning ribbons,
bjscied up their feathers and looked as
proud as a Beau lirummel.
The attendance at the Ferry Post
office building yesterday was very
large and it is likely that people will
turn out in goodly numbers to see the
show during the remaining few days,
as It Is certainly the best exhibition of
Its kind ever held in this city. There
is an unusually large number of en
tries. There are 163 single white Leg
horns on show. There are 93 Buff
Orpingtons, EO light Brahmas and S8
barred Plymouth Rocks from which tiio
judges have to select winners.
George H. Burgott of Lawton, New
York, judged the brown, white and buff
Leghorns, also the black Minorcas. Mr.
Burgott was judge at the recent exhi
bition held at Madison Square Gardens,
Kew York, and he declares that the
Leghorns at this show beat all that he .
Las ever judged.
F. E. Orr of Beaver, Perm., judged
the white TVyandottes, buff, gold and
silver Partridges, buff Orpingtons,
light Brahmas and white Leghorns.
George Holden of Minnesota passed
judgment on Rhode Island Reds, buff
Plymouth Rocks, game and "white
crested Black Polish.
Judge Henry Derrar of Ban Jose
looked after the water fowls, buff and
while Leghorns, Andalusian, buff, Coch
ins, dark Brahmas, white Minorcas,
Bantam clacs.
H- W. Emerson, who has been con
nected with many shows of this kind,
iis exceptionally gratified at the sue-
of the event. To his diligent work
and experience is largely due \ the
6how'Â« success. The judges will select

"Father Crowley Tells
About Use of the Money
The recent Youths' Directory bazaar
made $50,077 25 net. This announcement
was made last evening at a largely at
tended meeting of the general committee
at the Youths' Directory, James R. Kelly
presiding. Much enthusiasm followed the
announcement, and also rejoicing.
Rev. D. O. Crowley was mpre delighted
than any one else, for thfe. large sura
realized will warrant the erection of more
ample quarters for the bpys at the Ruth
Â«rford farm. The amount will be applied
to the reduction of the mortgage on the
farm. ...
The sum earned by the combined efforts
of all who worked for the worthy cause
>Â» the largest resulting from any fair
ever held in San Francisco with the ex
ception of the Cathedral fair in 1889.
A report was received which showed
the success of the several booths and also
other details of interest. The statement

Father Crowley has written 7 the follow
ing in reference to the bazaar and the
application of the net funds made there
at:
The Call has been actively interested in the
Farm School project from the Â«tart. and I
wish to say through It* columns that the
$50 077 25 made in our bazaar will be applied
to the reduction _of â¢ the mortgage on the
Rutherford farm. ' \u25a0 \u25a0 , â¢.
-Cur debt thus reduced, we will feel able to
put up a good etonÂ« building for. the accommo
dation of more boys. ..â¢,.â
The large amount realized In the fair, we
take as â¢ a nubile indorsement of the work
b*4ng done here and at Rutherford. Never wka
money given more cheerfully than this. The
members of cur finance committee and the
self- sacrificing ladies who worked in the ba
zaar met with a kindly and generous recep
tion everywhere. It was a pleasure to work
in such a cause.
To those who worked and those who gave,
\ em exceedingly grateful. They have Â£one
honor to themselves by serving a cause which
is as broad as humanity, and placed the
entire community under obligation, because
there is .no work Â«o profitable to society as'
that which enables homeleis boys to help
themselves. * \u25a0
We are very much Indebted to the press. The
newspapers of San Francisco are always on
the Elde of every genuine charity. To their
co-operation much of our success is due, and
I cr^tefully acknowlÂ«te e sam^^^
City Get* Earthquake Shock.
.An earthquake shock of unusual se
verity for this part of the world vis
ited San Francisco yesterday morning
at 11:25 o'clock. Many people on the
streets began to look at the bulletin
boards to see how many white men had
beer? killed In an explosion at the pow
der works, but those who happened to
be in the tops of tall, buildings were
well aware that It" was a seismic dis
turbance. Two minutes after the first
shock another one of less power was
felt by the more observing residents.
The waves in each case' were from
northeast to southwest.

'-: United' States Local Inspectors Bolles
and "Bulger received a communication
yesterday from 'George Uhler, .; Super
vising; Inspector General; at Washing
ton,"; D. jC, in reply/ to .a letter, from Su
pervising: Inspector John ; Bermingham
and themselves Inquiring as to , ;the
proper^ course; for them .to ipursueV in
the matter of re-issuing. sea-going
licenses to aliens reinstated in citizen
ship after a showing that' they had once
been 7 ; fraudulently 1 naturalized. . . :
, . Mr. Uhler says ; that : In' view of \ the
fact; that the law ; requires licensed of
ficers to be '.:\u25a0\u25a0 citizens.- of;,, the .^United
States/ licenses issued upon the presen
tation of ; naturalization /papers * 'pro
cured by fraud \u25a0 are void ! ; and { of \u25a0no ef-'
f eet. ; Congress has never seen fit, how
ever, to enact' a statute r which* 1 In
terms prohibits the issuance- of a li
cense to a person who obtained a for
mer v, license * upon ' f rauduledt naturall- ,
zation. But,; adds Inspector Uhler,. it
"does not follow ' that the local â¢ Inspec
tors ; may not take into, ; consideration
such facts. They are made the judges
of the character and fitness of the ap
plicant. '.''. â¢ ' \u0084 'L
The department feels that in a case
where; the 'local, board is satisfied that
actual moral ;gullt' on" the \u25a0 part; of ;the
applicant was involved In the procure
ment of fraudulent ' naturalization r pa
pers and that the applicant willfully and
knowingly Jand. with -intent -to deceive
perpetrated this fraud .upon the; Gov
ernment, the fact - should be :,: given
weight against the character of the ap
plicant. .As a practical penalty the ap
plicant, under such conditions,' might
be-refused the privilege : of taking the
examinatiop for at least two years. If,
on the other hand, the fraudulent , nat
uralization .was accomplished
actual | moral guilt on , the part of the
applicant and more through, ignorance,
it would be clear that the alleged mis
conduct .would not merit, such consid
eration as against an otherwise good
character. â¢ . ''t^^^^^S^^^A;^^'

FIVE FAVORITES DEFEATED
EDWARD SOLINSKI, CAPTAIN OF
THE BERKELEY HIGH SCHOOL
FOOTBALL ELEVEN.
YOUNG PLAYERS
ON GRIDIRON
The University of California football
field will be the scene of a game to-mor
row for the high school championship of
California. The. opposing teams will rep
resent Berkeley High School and Los An
geles High School.
The contest should be unusually close
this . season owing to the high class of
ball" put up by the members of both
teams in all their preliminary . games.
Berkeley High started the season well by
winning all its games until Alameda High
was met. This school was the only one
to give the northern champions a tussle
this season. Three times tie games were
played between these rival institutions,
and it was not until the fourth contest
that the Berkeley lads gained an advan
tage. Berkeley then met the Lowell
High School in the final contest for the
Academic Athletic League champion
ship, winning by the score of 5-0. "
Last season was the first time in six
years that Berkeley failed- to, reach the
finals, having met defeat at the hands of
Oakland High. â¢.
The husky Los Angeles players can
boast of even a better record, having
been more successful in the final games.
In the last three years Los Angeles has
won the State championship twice, hav
ing met defeat in the last game at . the
hands of the Lick team of this city by a
score of 16-12.
Both teams have been practicing hard
for this event, and if appearances count
for anything the game should prove the
liveliest and best attended ever played
in California between two secondary
schools. Both captains report that the
condition of their players could not be
better. If generalship counts for any
thing Berkeley will probably have a
slight advantage, having the valuable
services of Quarterback Miller, whose
ability to run a team cannot be dis
puted. In all the preliminary games
Berkeley played Miller showed phenom
enal speed in running in punts. The game
ia scheduled to begin at 2 p. m.
IV el son \u25a0 and McGovern . Matched.
NEW YORK, Nov. 28. â After, several
weeks' quibbling Terry McGovern and
Battling Nelson were finally ; matched
this afternoon to- meet In a six-round
contest. The battle will take place in

The sales yard of Chase & Co. proved
a horse show iniminiature last night
when : the Armourdale yearlings and the
horses of the late Duncan Cameron were
led into the ring.' , ' j
Sir Wilfred,! a grandson of the mighty
Ormonde, waa at ( once Vthe sensation [of
the sale, and its star. He, was bought, by
C. E; (Boots) Durnell \u25a0; for $6000. â¢ The
splendid '. son of ; Ossary ] was bedecked
with' ribbons when he was led: into' the
ring and was pronounced the highest type
of the English j thoroughbred. The ap
plause of , the spectators, the unaccus
tomed lights, and the noise sent him
plunging about the ring.
Possibly put of sentiment W. O'B.'Mac
donough, master of Ormondale, who â¢ bred
the colt, started the bidding at $2500. 7 The
bidding . was | lively for a time, Durnell's
$6000* finally proving the high water mark. ,
The purchaser is supposed to be acting for
John W. Gates, for whom he. is training
this year. ,
Mr. Macdonough bought a number: or
well-bred mares in the Cameron consign
ment. The star of his own; yearling sale
proved a chestnut colt by St. Carlo, out
of Lovelight, which went to the bid of
W. H. Hammond at $2100.
A full sister to Sir Wilfred was sold to
D. A. Ross for $2100. She is a yearling.

; The. only fault Abettors found with
the; St.. George f; handicap, run at Oak
land yesterday, was that the major
portion of them' failed to pick the win-
V It > was . decided over the \u25a0 Futurity
course.un a heavy track, and Andrew
B. Cook closed favorite at; 7 to 5. Rid-
I den by Fountain,, he led to the : stretch.-
I when; his old \trait :of ' running out
buried all chance of winning. Mo:
Brideon "-The; Mighty, an 8 to 1 shot,
gradually; overhauled H. L. Frank, dis
posing of that sprinter easily at the
wire. Radtke, on Nigrette, gathered in
show honors., \ Deutschland quit ; early
in the "Struggle.' ?
If' followers -of .the public choices
can maintain their equilibrium ; ; they
may weather the present squally : spell.
Five out of six short-priced ones took
the;ful' count. ./ v-;- :
GlenarvOn, , with the coUred rider,
Leroy, Williams, in the saddle, captured
the ' opening mile; and a sixteenth af
fair. Canejo. . the favorite, ran second,'
and might have won but. for I being
carried wide through the -stretch - by
the Redmyit; which [ received
substantial support, -showed to '; poor
advantage throughout the running.
; Barney , Schreiber's Sain ; : horse Dargln
upset calculations by taking.; the split , of
the \u25a0 mile and a sixteenth fixture, at odds i
of . 8 to 1. He was ridden by Frank Otis,
and in front ; f rom ";â¢ start to finish, lasted
long enough to earn a' neck decision over
Cloche d'Or. Possart,' the favorite, lost
the j show to " Isabellita.
.. i Tom i McGrath. . from the Schreiber , sta
ble,* and 'an 8 to 5 favorite for, the two
year-old scramble, was offered ; small ' op
portunity.; to V show : what he /could do.
Sehade, his pilot; managed; to get almost
left at the post, and that is the end of
the 'story.' St. Francis, a 10 to 1 shot,
with Fountain up, : splashed home \ first,
eight lengths in advance of Avonalis, the
second choice. Show, honors fell to Chief
Wittman. \u25a0 '
There: was never .any, doubt as to: the
probable winner.: of Ithe six furlong purse
run. Molero & Joseph's Cloudlight, the
8 to 5 favorite,'; went out in the lead with
a dazzling. burst: of speed, spreadeagling
: his : company! : Ten , lengths back. Salable
secured I the place â¢ from Celeres.
' -A" good horse could â¢ have walked : back-,
ward aboutas fast as " Gateway ran .in
the â¢ final mile selling; event, l nevertheless
Gateway won. ; , He* received' the ' support
of the society set; and ridden by^Teddy.
Robinson, won easily from Magrane. The
odds about 'the latter receded from 6 to 6
to 9 to 5. Red Cross Nurse finished third.

Herbert. ..who rode Cane jo, favorite
for the opening event, lodged a claim
of > foul against Williams. The Judges
thought- Glenarvon bore out of his own
free will anduthe claim , was not al
lowed. ' v
Trainer Bill r Murry bet $20 on ' Tom

Wlialing Bark Alice Knowles
\u2666Starts on Cruise Which
Will End at New Bedford
XO WAGES FOR CREW
Green Hands Are Shipped
on "Lay v and 3lay Get but
$1 for a. Lous* Voyage
The whallr.gr bark Alice Knowles, Cap
tain P. p. Montgomery, sailed yesterday
for New Bedford. She will not return to
this port except in the unlikely ev*nt of
her making an unusually large catch of
v. hales in the Pacific. She will go from
her to Hakodate. If when she gets theie
she is clean or has but a small catch
Captain Montgomery will leave her at the
Japanese port and turn her over to an
other captain, who will take her back to
Nptv Bedford, her home port, where she
his not been for many years, but which
in the future will be her headquarters.
Although whaling is in a way a sec
ondary consideration, she shipped her
crew for a whaling cruise of "eighteen
months and not more than three years."
This will enable the owners to make use
of the men to work the ship to' New Bed
lord and will save them the inconveni
ence of paying any wages. The green
hands who snipped on the Alice Knowles
do not know this and probably will not
tind it cut until some time next year,
when they will be paid oft at New Bed
ford with H.
When a green hand ships he signs the
articles and a note for an advance of J." 5.
He trusts for his compensation to his
share of the catch, less the advance and
such clothes and tobacco as he may draw
from the ship's stop chest. His share is
something in j the neighborhood of one
two-hundredth* of the total catch, figured
oil a basis of about one-sixth of the mar
ket value of the bone and oil. The ad
vance for which he signs goes to' the
man who ships him and represents that
individual'^ commission on the transac
tion. Clothes drawn from the slop chest
are expensive luxuries, and the man who
figures out the green hand's share of the
catch at the end of a successful cruise is
usually a mathematical marvel. As a
matter of fact. in. nine cases out of ten
the green hand nets Just JL In the tenth
case he may get enough to take an auto
mobile ride out to the park and- back
fcgain if he finds a not too avaricious
chauffeur.
To get that dollar he must work harder
jirobably than he ever did in his life be
fore. He must do his work under condi
tions that people ashcre. cannot even im
agine. For sleeping quarters he gets a
twentieth or thirtieth of the space, ac
<ording to the size of the crew, in an illâ
smelling forecastle of diminutive size.
Most of these forecastles have an aborig
inal population of irritating vermin, with
which the green hand must learn to live.
He must be satisfied with food that he
will eat only because there is nothing
else. He must put up with hot weather
tnd cold. He must expect for weeks at
a time to -wear wet clothes and sleep in
wet blankets. Jf he should utter a pro
test his exception will be overruled with
a heavy hand or foot or belaying pin cr
capstan bar, according to the vigor of his
protest or the whim of mate or skipper.
The Alice Knowles. w-hich sailed yester
day, had no difficulty in getting a crew,
and :J:<> Andrew Hicks, William Baylies,
Oayhead and other vessels, which soon will
start on their respective cruises, will all
carry their usual number of green hands,
shipped under the old conditions and all
trusting implicitly In the fairy tales told
by the men who are now looking for
them.
The officers on a whaler receive a sub
stantial advance, and If good luck blesses
the cruise they receive liberal compensa
tion- They, of course, get a larger share
than the green hands, and their Interest
'is figured fairly on the market value of
whatever the ship brings home.
Obid F. Glfford, the colored mate of the
Wiliiam Baylies, was paid SSMO for his
chare of the profits of the last cruise and
yesterday was along the water front clad
In fine raiment and rattling money in his
pockets. He had spared no expense in
fitting nlmself out. The only Inharmo
nious note was the substitution of a
t?weater for shirt ana collar, but three
eparkl'.ng diamonds riveted across the
front of the sweater amply demonstrated
that the -woolen raiment was merely a
rich man's eccentricity, and that he could
wear five boiled shirts and twice as many
collar* If he chose.
The luck of the William Baylies and
Gifford's diamond decked sweater will
ji'.ay star parta In the fairy tales usedSto
lure green hands for thÂ« next whaling
rruiee. but nothing will be said of the
fact that there has been no catch like the
Uaylles* made In years or that the green
hands, even on that fortunate ship, re
reived little more than $100. Nor will
anything be said of the old bark Califor
nia which after a three years' cruise re
turned a few weeks ago with the product
of one whale, and that little more than a
baby. _', \u25a0 \u25a0. /^T

Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ EUREKA, Nov. 38. â The 'â¢ tue Ranger
and the life* saving crew returned this
morning from standing by. the steamship
Roanoke/ -which f was;; disabled . at .Hum
boldt I entrance j last night. The "Roanoke
reached the bar at 4 o'clock in 'the after-:
noon and started In.' When well over the
bar J a "' wave !, struck her : astern, ; carrying
away C the rudder ' and - the â¢ rudder i>ost.
The I tide was at . an ebb and â¢" the vessel
-was -carried to sea. As soon as she was
struck she blew 'i the ; danger,; signal . and
I the \tug ' and \u25a0 life saving j crew r responded.
It ' was dark before they j reached the dis
abled vessel,** so '; they.; stood by all night.'
It- was^ so \ rough this morning that it was
impossible, to -transfer the passengers to
the tug -and. bring them to this port.
'The Roanoke. was. not damaged further
than the loss of < the rudder, ; so lt was
decided to rig a jury, rudder and. proceed
to San Francisco under her own steam.
She- is now off Humboldt, '; slowly going
south. Last : night in the heavy sees the
largest of the life savers' was lost,
it being impossible .for it . to live in the
sea that was running.
Fortunately, for the Roanoke, when she
was struck the tide was ebbing, other
wise she. would now have been beating to
pieces on . the shore, and many ot the
passengers, if not aU, would have been
lost; v

Mall. advice? from New York saj - :
Frt-sh interest has been Imparted to the
situation in Ccast seeded Raisins by the offer
ing fcr resale of well-known brands at a con
cession of fully seven-eighths of a cent a pound
beluw present coast parity on association
F^ods. By "association" is meant the com
bination of commercial packers and the Call
* forr.ia Raisin Growers' Cotcpany. As a mat
ter of fact the resellers, who are up-State Job
bers, are said to lose but half a cent a' pound. '
.as the goods originally cost them SWc less 4
p^r cent f. o. b. coaet. How they came to get
trat discount Instead of the usual 2% per cent,
is not specified. .
Their reasons for selling are said to be, first.
That they have found their trade would not
absorb the goods at the high prices, and sec
ond, that, having no confidence in the stability
cf tfca coast market, they concluded that it
would be better to sacrifice half a cent a pound
j;ow when there was a possibility to find a
market h^re during the holiday activity than
run the chance of losing more by waiting until
the holiday season is over. TSielr wisdom in
adopting the former cours* pecms to have been
demonstrated by the rapidity with wW:h such
offerings were absorbed by local Jobbers and
stores yesterday, the reported sales
s^rsTpgaticg about 1000 cases.
The praune market continues to gather
strength, the consuming demand which ha*
developed rapidly within the past few days \u25a0
Jf.t ins stimulated the upward movement in
'-.:â¢-* for which holders on the coast have
I b^en looking Jn view of the unusual statistical
reituation. On th* spot here the available sup
ply, outside of that owned by Jobbers, who are ;
now gming the bulk of the receipts, has been :
reduced to \ery email dimensions by the re- '.
crnvly greatly enlarged demands of censump

The weekly report of A. G. McAdle, section
director cf the climate and crop service of the
. Weather Bureau, lv as follows:
. GENERAL SUMMARY.
Cool and partly cloudy weather prevailed
throughout the State most of the week, with
â¢ light frosts in some sections. Showers were
â¢ of frequent occurrence and fairly heavy rain
j Jell in all sections at the close of the week.
The mountains are deeply covered with snow.
High winds on the 2Cth caused some damage in
the south. â â â . -.- \u0084 _ . Â«. \u25a0 - Â»- :-
The light rain of .the preceding meek was
â¢ fdllcwed by drying northerly winds and very
little fcood resulted from it. but tbe rains of
. the current week have been rapidly absorbed
by the soil and will prove of great benefit to
vegetation and orchard*. The soil is now in
\t:ry good condition and plowing and seeding
uT.I be resumed at once. The rain was badly
* needed In the central and northern sections,
both for the softening of the soil and to start
I ..feed. In Southern California the earlier rains
had started pasturage and early eown grain.
both ot wnich are now thrifty; the soil also' is
"in excellent condition and farm work Is pro
'grf ssine rapidly.
Orange orchards in all sections were greatly
improved ty the rain. Southern- California*
oranges are ripening slowly but satisfactorily.
V.::-<- a large portion of tbe orange crop In the
â¢Oroville and Porterville districts has been
lucked apd shipped, and harvest is progressing
In all sections. Walnut picking is completed
In come places and the yield 1b below average.
.Ojive picking and pickling are in progress. â¢
'â¢% SACRAMENTO ,VALtÂ£Y.â Cool weather
I .'.tinued mest of the week, with frequent
lipbt Khowera and generous rainfall at the
clost. The rain of the preceding weÂ«k was of
very little benefit, as it was followed by dry-
Ing north winds, but much good will result
from the rains during the current week. The
â¢oil rapidly absorbed the rain as it fell, and
In many places fanners will resume plowing
at once. â¢ Pasturage was greatly benefited and
orang-e orchards were Improved by the rain. A
I considerable portion of the orange crop has
been harvested and picking Is progressing rap
idly: the oranges are well colored and the
yield is very good. Olive picking and preserv
ing are In progress; the yield and quality are
about aver&z*.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS. â The weather
\u25a0was cool axd partly cloudy most of the week,
â¢w-ith frequent light frosts. Showers fell at in
tervals in ail Bections and heavy rain fell Sun
day night. The northerly winds following the
Upht rain of the preceding week absorbed the
moiFture In the soil, but th* later rains have
been cf great benefit to pasturage and orchards
and will enable farmers to resume plowing and
seed in j?. Range feed had become very scarce
in mot places and cattle were in poor condl*
tion. but the generous rains will soon start
fe**J. Orange orchards at Cloverdale - were
greatly benefited by the rain; the long drought
caused some <3amasÂ«* to the oranges, but a
fair crop 1s now probable.
PAN* JOAQUIN VALLEY.â PartIy cloudy
\ieath<Â»r prevailed during the week, with light
ehowers Thursday and Friday and generous
rains Â«t the close of 'the. week. The showers
Thursday and Friday were too light to be of
much benefit, but the latter rain will soften
the ground for plowing and start 'the green
feed Heavy frosts were \u25a0 reported on several
dales, but no damage resulted. Dry plowing
snfl seeding are progressing In some portions
of the valley, but as a nil? little farm work
Is being done." Pruning* 1Â» . progressing In
nine orchards and vineyards. Orange harvest
flr-*Mnue* and a large crop of excellent quality
"\u2666-!: be marketed. Large shipments of . pota
toes continue to southern points. Feed has be
come very *earcÂ«, but etock are healthy and In
fair condition. 'j. ' :" - \u25a0 _^

\u25a0winds on the 20th caused Â»ome damage to late
apples. The rainfall for the season Is much
above the TiormaJ and creater than ever before

N*EW YORK; Nov. 2S.'-^peculatl6nMn poms
rpedal etockit attained . unusual .violence Â»'to
Â£ay an<l the general maruet In the' latter part
of the day.Â«howed eirns of weariness In conÃ*-
of tfceÂ«e excesses and yielded quite jren
\u2666raliy. Very heavy profit-taking vu going on
(a the noiiet of the most exdtlnr advances In
the specialties. The Southern Iron group and
the metal industrials attracted the largest
share of speculative activity. Tennessee Coal's
upehoot ot 5% supplemented a rise of over 11
points yesterday, while Lead's jump of 9 points \u25a0
was only slightly In excess of the rise achieved
in yesterdays- market., The dealings' in these
two stocks were confused and feverish to tho
highest - degree. It was reported that prices
fcpveral points apart were paid for them at
the same moment on the floor of the Stock
Exchange, while brokers with orders â¢to buy
at the lower quotations and those with â¢ orders
to cell at the higher quotations being made
found it equally imposelbie to execute their or
ders in time. One after another stock. In the
list of obscure industrials was taken up -and
put through some such process as this, although
none made quite such mrrcurial fluctuations
as the two named. " Sudden, advances of 4
points In American Woolen, between 3 and 4
In Cotton Oil. Locomotive preferred. Anaconda,
Knickerbocker Ice and United States Pipe, and
over 2 points for Virginia-Carolina Chemical,
Colorado Fuel, . Sloss-*i3hef field Steel, Railway
Steel Springs and Woolen preferred offer con
crete examples. .The flatter reaction in the
market made wide Inroads In these advances
and carried the avtSge level of prices else
where well below last night. The. most conspic
uous example of strength among the standard
storks was St. Paul, ;with its 2%-pOint rise.
Reiterated rumora of an early issue of Its
treasury stock to stockholders' and the exten
sion of Its system in the I'acWc Coaet were
used again to stimulate the speculation In the
etock. . Attention was attracted to the money
situation by the heavy, transfers to interior
points through, the sub-treasury and by an en
gagement ot gold at the sub-treasury which
was Fuspect^d to be intended for export. Chi
cago exchange also returned to par. The day's
report of the sub-treasury operations showed a
loss by the banks to the institution since thÂ«
last bank statement of $1,4*1, 000, while a credit
balance at the Clearing-house this morning in
dicated a still further absorption. San Fran
cisco took another round million dollars, with
intimations of a possible further requirement. \u25a0
