ST. PAUL. Aug. IS.-The strike of
telegraphers on the Great Northern was
officially called off at Â»:15 to-night, the
men on that line having voted by a large
majority to return to work. The Ques

President Perham, however, stated that
the Indications" were that \u25a0 the Northern
Pacific operators would vote to continue
the strike. H# expect* to have a. definite

The battle with the bandits took'
place near the lihe'of Washington and
Idaho, .about seventy-five miles from
Spokane. Jones was- a. crack marks
man and put up one of the -most des
perate, rights, ever known in. that part
of the country. He -was armed only
with -a Colt's revolver, while the rob

known whether there were more than
four in the gang. :
Jones was - unmarried. He came _ to
Denver with his sister from Oklahoma
about three -years ' ago! 'and. followed
general contracting and horse trading.
Jones left for Washington on a trip
last April. His two sisters, Mrs. Willie
Fisher and Mrs. Georgia Nevil, live at
400 Alameda avenue. Information, of
the tragic and desperate affair came in
a letter from C F. Kdwards of Dixie,
Wash. They started for -Washington
to-night after telegraphing. Edwards.
They believe that their brother is dead.
Edwards' letter, indicates that, the
desperate battle occurred at some, out

week ago. According to the letter,
Jones was out in the hills prospecting.
He. made a rich' find and' 6old out his

WASHINGTON, Aug. ItâOne great
fear of tho Washington authorities has
been -that the boycott of American goods
by the Chinese would degenerate Into a
feeling of race hatred a^d that a physical
clash xnlrht ensue. Dispatches from
China to the State Department have con
tained the word "apprehensive." The
State Department has queried by cable
asking what Its Informants were appre
hensive of. "Physical violence" is under
stood to have been the substance of the
reply.
It has been told in these dispatches how
placards and pictures are being distri
buted through the disaffected districts in
Southern China showing mobs in Ameri
can cities beating and otherwise mal
treating unoffending Chinamen- Personal
investigation by Government agents who
have recenUy been in China have con
firmed the reports recently received here
of this most threatening aspect of the sit
uation. A purely commercial boycott, it
is believed here, would not be the cause
of so much apprehension as is being
shown by the administration. The prin
cipal fear is that Ignorant coolies in dis
affected areas may be so wrought upon
by incendiary preaching that they will
get out of hand and molest .American
merchants, missionaries and Consuls.
This uneasiness on the part of the ad
ministration Is thought in large part to
account for the appointment at this time
of Mr. Conger as special representative
to China. Travelers who have recently
been in that country assert that Mr. Con
ger holds in unusual degree the respect,
confidence and esttem of the Chinese
Government. It" Js assumed that it will
be his duty to prevail upon the Chinese
Government to issue orders to the Vice
roys in the districts where Â£he boycott
feeling is strongest to put down with â¢ a
strong hand the first attempts at disorder
that may be made. It is represented that
the Viceroys can do this easily If assured
that such Is the desire of the central
government-. ? â¢ !>v*7-v
Mr,' Conger said last night at Oyster
Bay:Â«
"Of course, the Government could not,
and very Hkely would \u25a0 not If it could,
compel its subjects to buy . American
goods, but it could and probably would
cay to the Viceroys of the provinces
where the anti-American agitation was
making Itself felt that it must stop, and
it would stop. too. In such respect the
Chinese are the most easily controlled
people In the world."
These remarks are believed here to out
line the kernel of Mr. Conger's mission.
Negotiations looking to the removal of
the purely commercial boycott can be
easily carried on through the regular dip
lomatic channel*.

empire of Russia is. formed and strengthened by the
indestructible solidarity of the Emperor with the people and of the
people with the Emperor: This concord of Emperor and people is
the great moral force which has created Russia in the course of

In our* manifesto* of February 24, 1903, we called to a close un
derstanding all the faithful sons of the Father, in order to protect
the , organization- .'of the state by establishing on a firm basis the
domestic. life of the empire, and then we devoted ourselves to
the task-:: of ordinating elective public institutions with govern
mental authorities and.of removing the disagreements existing be
tween - them, which had reacted so disastrously on the normal
course of our national life. _
WILL K FORM A LOWER HOUSE
The autocratic Emperors, our -ancestors, constantly had that
object: in view, and the time has come to follow out their good
intentions and to summon elected representatives from the whole
of Russia to take constant and active part in the elaboration of the
laAvs, thereby attaching to the higher state -institutions a special
consultative' body entrusted with the preliminary elaboration and
discussion' of measures and with the examination of the state
budget. .i . ' :;-: ; ; : -.V
It is for this reason that, while preserving the fundamental
law regarding the autocratic power, we have deemed it well to form
a Gosudarstvennaia Douma (lower house of the Assembly) and
to approve the regulations for elections to this douma, extending;
the validity of these laws to the whole territory of the_ empire,
with such exceptions as may be considered, necessary in the case
of some regions where special conditions obtain.
As the participation in .the labors of the Gosudarst
vennaia Douma of delegates from the grand duchy of Finland on
questions concerning the empire in general and the grand duchy
in particular \we will take special measures. *
At the same time, we have ordered the Minister of the Interior
to submit immediately for our approbation regulations for the
: electionsito ,the Douma, so that deputies fronr city governments
and from; the .military province of the* Don may. be able to
assemble not later than the middle of January, 1906.

peror remain 1 theoretically absolute. As
the Emperor is the supreme law giver
and autocrat, the decisions of the Douma
have only a recommendatory and not a
binding force, though the rejection of any
legislative measures by a two-thirds ma-;
jority of. both houses is sufficient to pre
vent that measure from becoming law.-
The representatives of the people will
have not only the right to be. heard on
any legislation proposed by the Govern
ment, but also can voice their desires on
new laws and will have the right to exert

NORFOLK, Va.. Aug. IS.â The re

them will be sent to their homes ia a

will be forwarded to their homes to

A careful examination of the bottom
of the river showed no more bodies
and the, railroad officials are convinced
that the death list is now complete,
though- reports are still current of a
much heavier loss of life.
All day ; long the operations of the
rescuing and wrecking crews con
tinued. There were reports that in tha
raising of one of the submerged cars
the end of the; coach was loosened and ,'
bodies were washed back into the
stream and floated away with the tide.
Later reports, however, denied this
story. * - . . ;
J. J. Thompson, a fanner, displayed k
considerable heroism when the' disaster
occurred. He leaped to the second coach. .
cut a hole in the roof and extricated thir
ty-five people just before the car became .
completely submerged. Cleveland Thomp

the disaster, to-day declared \u25a0 that En

' PORTLAND, Ore., Aug M 18.â Powerful
speeches in favor of the establishment
of a Department of. Mines and Mining
were made before' the"' Trans

ing. "'That the* American ', Mining Con

of-the-AÂ«>erican Mining -Congress',- to a
question as to whether' the Mining Con

Richards' terse reply was: . "The board

Persistency of effort' tv secure a De
partment of Mines arid. Mining as one
of the b'ra"nehes of the Government ,wiu
the, method advocated; by Edward H.
Benjamin,- president of the California
Mining' Association. Benjamin said that
notwithstanding the necessity for the
er.eatiQ'n.af a mining. department was so
apparent as to make any argument in
its favor unnecessary, Congress had
pigeonholed rresolution after resolution
recommending' a Department 'ot Mines.
He believed that the only way to secure
such a department is to keep on intro
ducing resolutions until every pigeon
hole is tilled and hammer on the doors
of Congress until it grants the demand
in" order to get rid of the noise.
CHINESE ISSUE DODGED.
Considerable curiosity exists as to
what coures the congress will take ,in
the matter of the restriction of Chinese
immigration. , Before the speeches of
Minister John Barrett and T. B. Wilcox,
president of the congress, were deliv
ered'yesterday it was believed that
after a tight on the floor of the conven
tion the Oregon and Washington dele
gations would succeed in securing the
indorsement of: the exclusion law. The
resolution which was adopted in com
mittee to-day straddles the question by
advocating a "comprehensive immigra
tion law, framed to remove all unrea
sonable restriction,' but to exclude all
undesirable persons 'of every nation."
It is expected that when this resolution
comes bef oro the congress to-morrow
the radical elements will oppose it.
While it is not a foregone conclusion,
it is probable that the next congress
will go ". to Kansas City.
The permanent organization commit
tee, with whom the matter of nominat
ijiE officers is left, to-day unanimously
named ex-Governor Francis of . Mis
souri for the position of president. As
it is the custom of the congress to se
lect Its president from the State in
whioh the convention is to be held this
is taken as an Indication' that the con
vention will go to" Kansas City. Den
ver is preparing to make a hard fight
for, the distinction, however, when the
matter comes before the congress .to
morrow.*!..'".. "... . - '

MIXIXO BUREAU FAVORED.
A protracted meeting' of the resolu
tions committee delayed the opening of
to-day's session of the congress. It
was expected that the committee would
conclude its labors after two sessions
yesterday and \be able to report after
the session opened to-day, .but. after, a
long wait. ex-Governor L. B. Prince of
New Mexico, chairman of the day, was
forced to change the order of business.
He announced that the addresses would
begin and that the first speaker would
be J. H. Richards of Boise, Idaho, pres,!-
dent of the American Mining Congress.
Richards, whose subject was "The De
partment of Mines and Mining," argued
for a Federal bureau as essential to the
industry. :
Chairman Prince introduced to the
congress ex-Governor David R. Francis
of Missouri, president of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition, who took for his
subject the influence of expositions.
Governor Francis said that five years of
effort without the hope of commercial
remuneration had been expended in
perfecting the St. Louis Fair, and even
if the amounts- expended had never
been returned the benefits derived from
the exposition fully compensated every
expenditure. Francis' also advocated
the Improvement of the Mississippi
River. " ' . "7 '
Governor Francis was followed by T.
W. Morgan Draper of. San Francisco.
Draper, like Richards, advocated the es
tablishment' of ; a Department of Mines
and Mining. ,
The last speaker on this subject . was
Edward H. Benjamin of San Francisco,
president of the California Miners' Asso-.
elation. .- . . -
SPEECH OF. BENJAMIN. . '
Benjamin paved the _way for his sub
ject by quoting /the statement of Henry
Clay, made one hundred years ago, that
three subjects claimed- the attention of
the National Legislature. These three'
were agricultural, commerce and manu
factures: .-;.- .v^i^'? :
Ihe' speaker recounted the circum
stances that" led up to the establishment
of the various Cabinet portfolios in ex
istence at present. In- 1849, when the De
partment of the Interior was established,
the mining ; Industry, said the ; speaker,
was comparatively -an one,
practically unknown to the. lawmakers at
Washington, and _ though -mining; was one
of the industries placed under, the control
of that department,. the Interior Depart
ment, was not Intended to be of any spe
ciar benefit v,to that- industry. ;
\u25a0;? During. the past half-century, the speak
er went on; the mining Industry has
grown beyond the comprehension of man.
The annual production of : coal has in
creased from J40.000.000 to $350,000,000; iron
from tiOO.OOO tons '. to i 20,000,000 tons ; lead

Voice in Government.
ISo iar as the Kussian plenipoten- <
tiaries are eoncernea, there never was
a. cliance of their yielding both indem
nity ana jjagtialien. Tne cession of
baghahen without indemnity was, ac
cording to the best inside information,
the extreme limit to which De Witte
would ever consent to go, and the Em- .
peror has not yet given the word to
even concede that. And to-nignt sud
aeniy a new factor has been introduced,
which, in the opinion of tboi*e most
competent to judge, ' lessens materially
me chances that he might do so, name
ly, the issuance of his manifesto grant
ing- a popular representative body to
Lib subjects.
The bearings ot this â¢â¢historical
document," as De Witte described it,
upon the issue are easily comprehen
sible. It is bound to ameliorate the
internal situation in Russia. It is the
entering wedge for the realization of
the century-old dream of the Russian
people.
"It will create enthusiasm at home,"
said one of the most prominent mem
bers of the Russian mission, "because
all thinking men realize that it means
eventually a great change in the com- '
position of the Russian state. It will
be followed by a true Parliament, a
responsible Ministry, a Premier, and
liussia will become a constitutional
monarchy."
It is pointed out that the manifesto
is timed like what the French call a
"coup de foudre," and that its signifi
cance is too plain to be questioned. It
vras to hare been issued last Satur
day, when the Russian reply was, pre
sented, but it was held orer until the
conclusion of the oral consideration of
the Japanese terms. Meantime the
terms had been published everywhere
throughout Russia. The press, even
the Liberal press, had replied that Rus
sia could not pay money for the privi
lege of getting out of Manchuria. The
Emperor had publicly proclaimed to bis
tubjects on July 2S, in reply to a tele
gram of the Orenburg clergy:
"The Russian people can rely upon
me, 1 will never conclude a peace
humiliating- or unworthy of great Rus
sia."
The manifesto Is Emperor Nicholas' an-
Bwer to the Japanese demand for the
payment of a war tribute. The grant of
this broad reform is regarded as virtu
ally an appeal to the Russian people for
fcupport to resist it.
GRAVITY OF SITUATION.
At Tokio It is Impossible to tell what
view will be taken. Peace probably can
be even now secured by the sacrifice ofÂ»
the indemnity. Vague intimations to
night come from the Japanese side that
"the demand for the cost of the war"
might be moderated, but Witte replFes
that he will pay liberally for the main
tenance of the Russian prisoners in Japan
but "not a kopeck for tribute."
The gravity of the situation from the
Japanese point of view is contained In
the following statement given to . the
press :
"I cannot Kay positively, because all
things are possible, but I fear that the
meeting on Tuesday will be the fare
well session of the "Washington confer
ence. Japan has done her utmost for
peace. Russia now knows Japan's irre
ducible minimum."
Witte himself to-night gave not the
slightest encouragement. For publication"
he said:
"We meet Tuesday only to sign the pro
tocol." with the accent on the word
"only."
Another bad sign was the change in the
personal attitude of the plenipotentiaries
toward each other. During the week
they have been growing more and more
friendly at the luncheon which they lake
together at the navy yard. The conver
sation was lively and even gay at times.
To-day they sat together and ate in
silence. All seemed strangely constrained,
es !f realizing that they could only agree
to disagree arid that the war must
go on.
To-night the situation can be summed
up in a single sentence: Prompt and
heroic action by outside Influences alone
can save the conference. . -..' . [^
At Tokio and St. Pcters-butg the final
issue trul be oeciued. The Japanese liave
been implaeabJe inroughout ttie six days'
Biit:i;gs. 'liiey have listened and ex
piaiiieu, but they have yielded not an ioia
oi the bubstanee of their original de
manus. Air. oe Wiite accepica outright
eevt-u of the twelve Japanese condition's,
out in principle and lour, including me
main issues, indemnity and teaghaiien, he
rejected. The other two. limitation of
iia\\ii power and the surrender of in
terned warships, might have been ar
rai.ged had there been any prospect of
lio'ictmeiu on the two points upon wnich
tne divergence seemed irreconcilable.
in the oral discussion of the terms,
Mr. I.- VVute yielded upon two articles,

tfctn b.iUngs of the plenipotentiaries has
only been to emphasize the position taken
by De Wiite in ihe written repiy he pre
btiited last Saturday to the Japanese
lettnM and now both sides turn towaid
home for the last words before the cards
itre thrown face downward on the table
iitxt Tuesday, for the impasse reached
to-aay by the plenipotentiaries is recog
nized to be only a diplomatic fiction. If
In the interim fresh instructions are re

FORTSMOUTH, N. H., Aug. 19.â Late to-night President Roosevelt arranged for
one of the Russian envoys to go to Oyster Bay. Ihe President is understood to be already

Watt was in the divorce court some
years ago when his wife sued for a
divorce, the co-respondent being Lady
"Violet Beauchamp, daughter of the
late Lord and Lady Roden, and the di
vorced wife of Sir Reginald Beauchamp.
Watt has since married Lady Violet
Beauchamp.
Since the granting of the divorce
Watt and his former wife have been
in the law courts regarding their mar
riage settlements and much \ bitterness
has resulted from this litigation. A
couple of weeks ago the parties .ap
peared in a Police Court, Watt charging
his former wife 'with having assaulted
and violently ejected . him from her
house, where he said he went for the
purpose of trying to compromise their
disagreement.
LONDON, Aug. 18. â A great sensation
has been created by the arrest of Hugh
Watt, a financier and formerly a mem
ber of Parliament for : the Camlachle
division of Glasgow, on the charge of
attempting to procure a private de
tective to assist in the murder of his
former . wife. Detective Marshall tes
tified' in a Police Court to-day that
Watt offered him $5000 if he would in
duce the woman to come to Watt's flat,
where he proposed to Kill her by the
administration of chloroform and then
to remove the smell of chloroform with
peppermint. Watt was remanded for
trial on ball of 93000. The police found
both chloroform and peppermint in
Watt's apartments. .
: A second infernal machine, resembling
that sent to Jacob H. Schiff, was, re
ceived through the mail to-day at the
office of M. Guggenheim's Sons, at 71
Broadway. The contents were nearly the
same as those of the Schiff bomb. A
clerk was suspicious of the | package, ; as
the address was made of printed letters
cut from a newspaper, and he placed the
package in water. After standing there a
short time there was a slight, explosion,
due It is thought to the'gases generating
in the box.
Schiff was one of the delegation which
recently visited Mr. Witte, the Russian
envoy, at Portsmouth in the interests of
the Jews of Russia.
NEW YORK, Aug. 18.â An explosive
package capable of causing death was
sent to Jacob" H. Schiff, the banker, to
day at the office of Kuhn.'Loeb & Co., of
which he is a member. Schiff was at Bar
Harbor to-day, and when the machine, in
closed In a wooden box about six inches
long,, was received at his office the clerks
Immediately sent it to the police. At first
the police reported that the .affair was
a joke, but further investigation by an
expert : revealed the presence of thirty
one grains of a high explosive powder
and two 32-caliber loaded cartridges. â¢
Arranged so as to flre this charge mere
ly by ordinary handling of the package
was a cylinder of emery paper lying .In
contact with both the powder and several
matches. The flash of this powder would
have discharged the cartridges, which
had been carefully filed at the fulminat
ing ends. Lead slugs were packed in be
side the bullets, evidently to make the
discharge more dangerous. Throughout
the machine there was an oily saturation
to insure the flash of ; any .one of the
matches reaching the powder. The whole
mechanism was concealed under a news
paper wrapping of Wall street stock quo
tations.

LADY SMITH OF LOJTDON. WHOSE NAME IS PROUDLY BORNE BY ONE OF
SOUTH AFRICA'S CITIES, WHICH WAS STUBBORNLY BESIEGED BY THE
BOERS DURINO THE RECENT WAR. â¢
Yesterday afternoon Sir Charles and
Lady Smith were the guests of Patrick
Calhoun, President Holland and other
representatives of the United Railroads
on a tour of this city, which was made
in one of the company's private cars.
What most interested Sir Charles on the
trip was the convenience of the service
and the method of transferring of pas
sengers on a single fare.
For many years Sir Charles Smith was
a member .of the diplomatic corps of
Great Britain and. at one time he was
chief of the diplomatic corps with Lord
Roberts in Afghanistan. He served
throughout the Afghan campaign, was
with Lord Napier on his trip to Magdala,
and has earned distinction in campaigns
in Abyssinia, in Persia and other
places familiar In British history. With
Sir Charles on his present trip is Mar
shall Miller, consulting engineer of the
Mexico City Tramways Company, who
came north with a view of studying San
Francisco's street railway system. The
distinguished visitors are traveling in a
private car of the Mexican Central road,
which will carry them, northward on
their visit to the Portland exposition.
"In no place in the world," said he,
"have I found such a perfect system of
street railways as in Los Angeles, and I
must claim that I am interested In
several roads on the other side of the
world that are regarded as being very
fine. To me the Huntington system of
roads was a marvel and It would be of
much benefit to the managers of systems
in other parts of the world if they would
send their engineers to California to study
the methods of operation and the general
conditions of the street railways here."
SOLDIER AND DIPLOMAT.
As a street railway magnate. Sir
Charles figures prominently as the presi
dent of the London board of directors of
the Mexico City Tramways Company, and
eighteen other lines, most of them elec
tric, among them the systems of Lisbon,
Capetown and Santiago de Chile. He Is
also president of the Marconi Wireless
Telegraph Company, and is a leading
factor in many other important commer
cial concerns of England and her prov
inces. It is his first visit to the extreme
western section of the United States and
he frankly admitted yesterday that its
development had proved a great surprise
to him.
OWNS MANY RAILWAYS.
Colonel Sir Charles Euan Smith, one. of
the foremost of Great Britain's tramway
magnates, and a man who has been prom
inently Identified with the history of his
country as a soldier and diplomat, and
Lady Smith, after whom the city of
Ladysxnlth In South Africa, famous for
its siege, was named, are registered at
the Palace Hotel. The distinguished
visitors arrived here yesterday from Los
Angeles on their way home from Mexico.
They will remain here several days and
then proceed to Portland. From there
they go to Vancouver, and then by way
of Montreal to London.
Sir Charles came to this country to
attend the International Railway Con
gress in Washington and from there he
went to the City of Mexico, where a com
pany of which he is the head is in con
trol of the street railroad system. He
has spent two months in Mexico, part of
which time he was the guest of Presi
dent Diaz.
The letter written by Mrs. Taggart in
answer to the pleading letters of. Captain
Taggart was read just before dinner.
Taggart, when asked about the letter
said:
""The language does not sound like Mrs.
Taggart, but more like her lawyer's."
Taggart, on cross examination, admit
ted that he was sick at the time 'and
thought reconciliation possible.
The only thing that occurred of inter
est other than Major Taggart's testimony
to-day was a determined effort on the
part of the major's counsel to get the
court to issue an order of attachment
for Miss Alice Thatcher of Cincinnati,
who has left Christ's Hospital, according
to their statements, because she is want
ed with the records of the hospital in
Wooster, to determine Mrs. Taggart's
conduct during the time she was confined
there,
Ail indication of the drift the defense
will take was dropped by Attorney
Emyser to-day in a chance remark. This
is that Taggart was not in his light mind
after he came back from the Philippines.
There is no belief that Taggart was in
sane, it is said, but an attempt will be
made to prove that he lost control of
himself at times and suffered from hallu
cinations.
Attorney Sterling, In answer to Bmyser's
request, called the motion a frivolous
one. Every circumstance must be taken
into consideration to establish proof of
misconduct, he raid. The love Major Tag
gart bore for his wife was a marvel and
he declared that he had known no such
love in history. He called Colonel Miner
a lecherous old beast.
WOOSTER. Aug. IS.â Reserving the
right to call witnesses and Introduce the
records of Christ's Hospital, Cincinnati,
should they be able to obtain the rec
ords, the side of Major Taggart In the
Civoroe case being heard here rested this
alternoon at 4 o'clock- Major Taggart
was on the stand all day and among
other things call that his wife had sent
him a Bible to read In his prison home.
Judge Smyter. as Mrs. Taggart's at
torney, then made a motion that the
charges against Rlther, Fortescue, Miner
and Spencer be dismissed- He admitted
that the evidence against Bash was suf
ficient to put them on their defense, but
asked that the other charges be done
away with. He stated that the midnight
charges against Captain Rltber and the
t anonymous letter were all that there was
against him.

WASHINGTON. Aug. IS. â The find

vestigated the Bennington disaster are
expected to be given out on Monday.
Since the boilers of the gunboat ex
ploded, killing and wounding so many
of the crew, a quiet Investigation has
been going on to determine the condi
tion of the engines and boilers on other
ships of the navy. The results have
been surprising. Some unexpected dis
coveries were made, and some rather
unpleasant ones. Several vessel* have
been ordered to the navy yard for re
pairs to their engine room equipment.
The names of these vessels are with
held at the Navy Department. It may
be said, though on the best authority,
that the conditions that have so far
been revealed will In all probability re

The work of the council was concluded
this afternoon, when the raising of the
new. great chiefs took place, after which
the standing committees for the ensuing
year were named.
The Great Council of the Daughters of
Pocahontas made rapid progress. Repre
sentation ; to the Great Council from
subordinate councils was cut down from
five to two for each charter. The per
capita tax was ordered the same as be
fore. The great Pocahontas' salary for
the year was fixed at $300, that of the 1
great keeper jof wampum at $50 and of
the great keeper of records at $250.
.The representatives of both councils will
depart for their homes to-morrow. They
were entertained at Grass Valleyythis
evening by Ponemah ' Council, Degree of

October 15, 1855, Rev. Father An

Ignatius College, adjoining.the church
of that name, jon the present site of
the Parrott building. ' This was the
first home* of his orderâ a "> home, with
which he was Identified until his death
forty years after.' Fifty years ago Mar
ket street, between Fourth. and Fifth,
was a wilderness of sand dunes, known
as St. Annes Valley. , In an: out of the

aschi's work as a prospective college
on January 1, j 1859, and formally ap
pointed him j superior of the house.
The little college made no provision, for

attending It from all parts of the city.

The third annual convention of the Pa
cific Coast Association of Railway Sur
geons was brought to a close at the St.
Francis Hotel yesterday afternoon, when
the organization elected officers for the
coming year.- Dr. - Thomas â¢W. Hunting
ton of Oakland was elected president; Dr.
T. C. McCleave of Berkeley, first vice
president; Dr. "W. O. Spencer of Hunt
ington, Or., second vice president: Dr.
John P. Dunn of Oakland, secretary, and
Dr. Frank L>. Adams of Oakland, treas
urer. One of the interesting subjects dis
cussed at the convention Thursday and
greatly talked of. yesterday was a paper
read by Dr. "VT. B. Cof/ey of this city en
titled . "Multiple- Tumors of the Brain-
Operation and Recovery." In this paper
Dr. Coffey dealt with a recent personal
experience at the Southern Pacific Hos
pital, where he operated upon a patient
and removed three tumors from his brain.
It was one of the few cases in surgical
history where the patient fully recovered.
In the absence of any symptoms to de
termine that tumors existed, Dr. Coffey
found on exploring the brain that a pres
sure on the nerve trunk was produced
by a foreign growth, and he promptly
undertook the difficult operation, with
the success already stated. From a sur-.
gical standpoint the operation j is regard
ed as a very important one and has at
tracted attention all over the country. \u25a0
At yesterday.'s session Dr. George iW.
Carson read a paper on typhoid fever
and made many valuable suggestions for
the detection of the disease in railroad
camps and means for preventing its de
velopment. '
Dr. J. H. O'Connor gave some Interest
ing information upon the prevention" it
cancer of the stomach by surgical treat
ment of ulcerous affections, and he also
related a ease where an opening between
the stomach and intestines was made for
the sidetracking of diseased portions of
the stomach and allowing food to pass
through another source. While of the
opinion that ulcers are materially respon
sible for cancers, he was also of the opln
that that cancers are curable if properly
treated.
Last night the visiting surgeons enjoyed
a "smoker at | the St. Francis . Hotel . as a
concluding incident of .their interesting
meeting here. |
Statistics compiled by the various au-,
tomobila trade associations show that

A pleasant variation in the pro
gramme was furnished by the four
songs written by Edward F. Schneider
and sung by Mrs. Schneider. The first
of the four, the "Absented," -is a gem.
Exquisitely lyrical, it is worthy to
stand with the lieder of Schumann and
was sung with keen sympathy by Mrs.
Schneider. The singer was not quite
equal to the dramatic demands of the
following song, "Horch Auf," a highly
picturesque and spirited lyric. Curi
ously commonplace in comparison were
the two other songs, both, however,
very well sung by Mrs. Schneider and
cleverly accompanied by the composer.
The other novelty of the programme
was the new suite by Dr. H. J. Stewart,
"Scenes in California," from which two
movements were played â a nocturne,
"Under the Redwoods," and "Before the
Gringo Came.** that includes Ca) Span
ish dance, and (b) "Tarantella." The
last two will doubtless come Into im
mediate orchestral favor, being emi
nently colorful and catchy. The taran
telle can In no wise escape popularity,
and the whole suite Is smooth. flow-
Ing, finished and in the best Stewart
manntr. Dr. Stewart conducted.
BLANCHE PARTIXGTON.
Amonf the redwoods of Eddy street,
the Tivoli grove, thÂ« second of the public
Jinks of the Bohemian Club was given
yesterday afternoon. As last year, the
\u2666vent attracted a large and representa
tive audience, who heard the varied pro-
STamme with many signs of pleasure.
The caitf event of the afternoon was
be presentation of "The Quest of the
Gorgon," the year's music drama, the
poem by J. Newton Tharp, the music by
Theodw Vogt- It cannot be said that the
composition is of exceptional interest.
Possibly among the redwoods of Guerne
ville, warrant for ail sorts of enchant
ment. It xnay have persuaded. In plain
Eddy etreet it does not. It is not worthy
of tilÂ© subject, not worthy of the com
poser, whose kuinorous and effective set
ting of the Christmas low xnuelc is
among the best ex'olved in the club. But,
as a whole, in "The Quest of the Gorgon"
Mr. Vogt's themes are commonplace, hia
harmony monotonous, and only in the lit
tle prelude does tlje work approach orig
inality or distinction.
After this movement, In places effective
and charming, the best number Is- the
tframatic scene for Dionysus, a declama
tory effort, something: on the order of
Wagner's "Evening Star," and which was
admirably sung by U A. Larsen. There
are many choral numbers, in which the
handsome chorus gathered under Mr.
Vogt's baton -did excellent service. Thom
as Rickard was the other soloist, and
was etTfietive as far as his opportunities
went in his song, the "Orizon to Sybil."
To Dr. AVilson Ehiels, wbo 'acquitted him
self well of the task, fell the reading of
the po*m.
But Mr. Vogt has fallen short of his
opportunities here and done neither
himself nor his subject, picturesque and
suggestive, Justice. He fulfilled his du
ties as conductor excellently, and the
very good orchestra proved well equal
to the demands of his baton.
It was good to hear again the "Pre
lude" of "The Hamadryads" with which
the programme opened, and which was
the feature of last year's Jinks. Mr.
McCoys vital and temperamental work
pains largely by rehearing, and lost
-nothing in the spirited conducting of
the composer. He followed It with an
other McCoy composition, a suave and
sprightly â¢â¢serenade"' from the suite "in
Bohemia" of the Spanish genre, in
which the composer excels.
"The Man in the Forest," from the
jinks music of 1902, by Joe D. Redding,
was also revived and Its quaint and
characteristic Indian themes came very
pleasantly. Mr. Redding, who conduct
ed, was received with the usual ova
tion.

Through their attorneys, W. H. Lln
forth of San Francisco and B. A. Har
rington of San Jose, Rogers and Main
began their defense .by attacking the
validity of the Grand Jury. All the
grand jurors were subpenaed to ap
pear and a number were put on the
stand to testify to their qualifications,
with the result that five were found
to have served on the last Grand Jury.
Two others are not on the assessment
rollanffthree others testified that they
did not'vote on the indictments, which
leaves less than the necessary number
of legal votes to bind the Indictments.
The first draft of names for the
Grand Jury, was made by Judge Smith
of the : Superior Court in January.
Since that time the Legislature passed
a law disqualifying any one from serv
ing on two grand juries within a year.
The examination of jurors was con
tinued, until to-morrow morning. The
attorneys for Main and Rogers will
move to quash. the indictment, but sev
eral minority stockholders declare that
should the -court so order an informa
tion will at. once be filed charging them
with felony and the prosecution will be
continued in the criminal courts.

Captain Berger, who is so closely,
identified with the musical education of
the natives of Hawaii, was born in Ber
lin, Germany, and received his musical
education in that city. When a lad he
entered the military service, and after a
short period he was assigned to one of
the crack cavalry bands. Promotion
quickly -came to him/and when the
Franco-Prussian War broke out in
1870 he was director of the Royal and
Imperial Uhlan Regiment, the body
guard of Emperor William I of Prussia.
Captain Berger served with his regi
ment all through the terrible campaign
and was'present at the fearful battle of
Gravelotte and at the siege of Metz and
the surrender of Napoleon 111 at Sedan,

Bergery.and it was his voice that shout
ed "Hochder Kaiser" as he passed un

Place.de Mars. Five hundred thousand
/victorious Prussians marched in that
memorable parade, but it was Captain
Berger'whose hoarse Prussian voice
dismayed the Parisians who heard the
shouts. of .their victors in their beloved
capital. -In the magnificent hall of the

Treatment of tropical diseases was
the subject of the evening lecture by
Sir Patrick Manson before the students
and medical men at the Cooper College
last night. Instances were given of
cures for chronic dysentery, aenemia
and malaria by a close study of symp
toms and the use of . ordinary medical
knowledge. Abcess of* the liver was
taken up for special demonstration. Sir
Patrick told of the use of a needle for
making an incision and letting out of
the pus from the liver. to cure the fever
caused by this malady.
The morning address was on fevers,
recurrent and caused by abcess of the
liver. Many of the less prevalent trop
ical fevers were discussed and facts,
found by years of- work in India and
Africa, were touched on by the orator.
To-day will end the ten lectures that
have been .given, by Sir Patrick Man
son, England's greatest pathologist, in
accordance with the wishes of Dr. Lane,
founder of Cooler Medical .College,
by which a noted scientist Is secured

BERKELEY, Aug. 18. â Churchly
amity is one thing, but, according' to
the members of the First Presbyterian
Church of Berkeley, a bargain Is also a
bargain, and the canny folk ' of the
church, remembering the latter declar
ation, have refused to ratify the sale
of their church property to the Trinity
Methodist Episcopal Church congrega
tion of Berkeley on the terms recently
arranged by the trustees of both .con
gregations. ' .-...'
. The Presbyterian church .members
think that their property on Allston
way, .adjoining the university, is worth
at least $30,000. The Methodists had
proposed. to give $22,500 for the church
building and the lot on which it stands.
Unless the Methodist men can be
brought to see the desirability of add
ing about $7000 to their original offer
it is deemed unlikely that the bargain
between the church congregations will
be brought to a conclusion.
Rev. C. K. Jenness, pastor of the Meth
odist church, had assisted In bringing
the deal to the stage where its success
needed only the approval of the Presby
terian congregation, the trustees of the
latter body having looked with favor
on the $22,500 offer. Dr. Jenness with
his people had planned to erect a new
edifice for the Trinity Methodist Church
and had raised considerable money for
that purpose. When it was hinted to
them that the Presbyterian church was
on the market or could be purchased
the plan to build was abandoned tem
porarilyand negotiations were at once
begun for the purchase of the Presby
terian property.' .
.- A second conference will now be
held between representatives of 'both
congregations, when the changed con
ditions will be considered and a new
offer made by the Presbyterians in line
with; the temper of the meeting held
last Wednesday night . ' . .
.The will of the late Pierre Priet, pro
prietor of Marchand's restaurant, who

property on O'Farrell street, near Powell,
to his wife, various sums are set aside in

To Melanie Chesnau and Melanie Saul
nier of Soulaire, France, Is bequeathed
1300 a year each, andafter the death of
his wife $10,000 will be placed In trust for
them with the Union Trust Company;
The sum of $5000 is to. be placed In trust
with the same company for the Muni
cipal Council of Soulaire et Bour, France,
to be devoted to the relief of destitute
men; women and children of that village.
To the following local charitable insti
tutions of San Francisco is bequeathed
$1000 each: French Ladies' Benevolent

tured, Though He Takes
to His Heels.
Emanuel Hirschfeld was caught in
the act of ransacking the room of Wil
liam Pedler at 423 Larkin street Thurs

the stranger until an officer arrived, but
after a struggle he succeeded in freeing
himself and fled to the street. Several
pursued him and he was finally cap
tured and taken to the Hall of Justice.
Mrs. Pedler was out shopping during
the morning: and when she returned
shortly after 11 o'clock she noticed a
etrangrer In her son's room. She found
Hirschfeld ransacking the apartment.
He gave a lame excuse for his presence
there, which convinced Mrs. Pedler that
he was a sneak thief. He tried to
leave, but she grappled with him and
called for the police. After a struggle
he freed himself and ran to the street.
She continued after him and George
Monahan, who works in Wreden's gro
cery next door, heard her screams and
joined in the pursuit.

after running a block. Hirschfeld had
a knife in his hand, but Monahan suc
ceeded in overpowering him. Police
man E. Sullivan arrived on the scene
and placed Hirschfeld under arrest.
The prisoner had also a revolver and
a bunch of keys In his possession.
Several days ago the apartments of
another family who live In the same
bouse were robbed. In Pedler's room
there was. several hundred dollars'
â¢worth of Jewelry, but the intruder did
not have a chance to get it.

The highwayman had a good start on

In simplifying the matter. To those whom
he robbed he was short and tall, light
and dark and garbed to suit the* fancies
of the men who sat la front of his threat

Failure* has not discouraged the man
hunters, however, and the search in thÂ«

The criminal has had ample opportunity

OAKLAND, Aug. IS.â ln pursuance of
a plan to definitely settle the question
of the boundaries of Lake Merrkt with
out litigation which must of necessity be
long drawn out and very expensive to

a conference cf Use prcpe:ty owners along
the shores of the lake, to diccuss the best
method of finally settling the disputed
question without revert to law. All those
ewnirr property abutting qn the lake
have been requested to be present at the
conference, as it is desired by the Mayor
to learn Just what the condition cf the
boundary question is and to hear the
opinion of the interested parties.
Mayer Mott hopes to be able to bring
about an amicable settlement of the dif
ficulty regarding the true boundaries of
Lake Merritt without involving the city
in suits to quiet title. If he is successful
la his effort to bring about an agreement,
it is his purpose to take measures for the
improvement of the property of the city
along the shores of the lake, which will
be made the center of a system of pub
lic parks, which in time will extend
throughout the entire city.
The question of the boundaries of Lake
Merritt, which the Mayor has undertaken
to settle by means of a conference of the
property owners, does not in any way
involve the property south of Twelfth
street dam. In this case the only counter
claim to the property would be that of
the State and there is not the remotest
danger of that claim being pressed.

flicted a superficial wound. Before he
could accomplish his, purpose the.de

?Co better eailcnnan than Captain Thom;>
son of the big bark Homeward Bound evet
trod the deck of a windjammer. He brought
bis veÂ»sel Into port Thursday evening, 119
days Trom Newcastle. England, the banner
trip of the year. The Homeward Bound was
formerly the German* chip Otto Gildemelster,
which made the slowest voyage on record and
once upon a time came into this port ions
after she had been posted as missing. Since
Thompson has had her. however, she has been.
setting the pace for the clipper ships of lha
world. Thompson does not believe In taking
in sail. He sees to It that his xpars are sound
and carries plenty of epare canvas. And he
always needs it. Several times durine the
voyage Just ended the wind made ribbons of
the Homeward "Bound's canvas. On April 30
In a southwester that lasted thirty hours, the
bark was stripped to bare poles and on June
2O more sa!!Â» were blown away. The Home
ward Bound came from Newcastle, England,
in 119 days. Just how speedy this Is can bÂ«
Judged from the fact that the French ship
Jjeon Bureau left Newcastle 2CKJ days ago for
this port, ha* not yet arrived and her non
arrival Is as yet causing no anxiety. The
British ship Bardowie left the same port, also
for San Francieco. IS3 days ago and is not
expÂ«Krtcd tor some time yet. And if you go
en board the Homeward Bound and ccc Cap
tain Thompson, knowing only that Thompson
is his name. It is more than likely you will
csk the tail, cllm youth. "Is your father on
board?" And Captain Thompson won't care if
you do.

The Pacific Mail Company's Panama
liner City o f Sydney. Captain W. H. Mc-
Lean, arrived yesterday from the isthmus
â¢with seventy passengers and 596 tons of
cargo. She brought treasure valued at
J130.553. Clean as her decks was the Syd
ney's bill of health, and the Federal sur
geons gave her quick dispatch through
quarantine.
She encountered hot weather along the
coast, and at San Jose de Guatemala
\u25a0was delayed for five days on account of
a tropical storm, in which several light
ers wera lost. The one exciting feature
of the voyage was a battle at Panama
between Chief Officer Leo Quayle and a
mutinous Mexican sailor. The man at
tacked Quayle with a knife and stabbed
him In the breast and hand during the
encounter, which ended with Quayle scor
ing two knockdowns and a knockout. The
trouble started over some trivial matter.
The sailors sulked and became insolent.
Then he started to run amuck, where
upon Quayle appeared on the scene and
decided to put the man in irons. He was
about to do so when the man slashed at
him with a knife. The slit in Quayle'a
blouse marks the spot where the blade
entered. Quayle grabbed for the knife,
but the sailor drew the sharp blade
through the mate's fingers, cutting them
to the bone. With his warm Manx blood
dripping freely Quayle rose to the occa
sion and there followed a real sailor fight.
The Mexican gave no more trouble ex
cept to the ship's surgeon, under whose
care he was until the Sydney reached
Acapulco. where the Mexican sevet-ed his
connection with the Harriman shipping
Interests.
George W. Dickinson, United States
Consul at Acapulco, and A. A. Winslow,

\u25a0were passengers on the liner. They are

The plaintiffs in the proposed suit
claim ; that in August of last year
O'Brien and Riebel advanced $75 to
Montgomery to prospect in the Bullfrog
district, with the understanding that a
partnership between the men in ' any
thing that Montgomery should dis
cover would last until September 9,
when Montgomery and O'Brien, who
had accompanied him on the prospect
ing trip, returned to Goldfleld. It is
charged that Montgomery located six
claims in the Bullfrog district in the
names of his partners, but when he
took up the ledge known as the Sho
shone mine he filed upon it in his" own
name and that of Edwards. It is fur
ther alleged that the incorporation of
the Montgomery-Shoshone Mining Com
pany was part of a plan of Montgom
ery's to prevent his former partners
from getting a share of the property.
: In view of the richness of the mine
and the fact that negotiations for its
sale are now In progress, the O'Brlen-
Finnegan suit is expected to raise seri
ous complications that will keep the
contending parties busy in the courts
of Nevada for years to come. Yester
day it was common report about the
Palace Hotel that two other men, one
now in this city and other a prominent
man. of Los Angeles, are also ready to
prove that they, staked Montgomery
at. the time he started out on the pros
pecting tour that ended in the dis
covery of the Shoshone ledge.
Who staked "Bob" . Montgomery in
his mining operations -In Nevada? has
suddenly become .an -interesting ques
tfcmi'among the large number, of Tono
puh.and Goldfleld mining men now
gathered at the Paiace Hotel in this
city, >but it will probably be . left to a
court of competent jurisdiction in Ne
vada to. fully determine the question.
When > the- outside- world began to hear
of ; the , famous Montgomery-Shoshone
mine at Bullfrog, New, now regarded
as. one of ; the richest properties' m the
West, it was generally, understood that
E.'. A. Montgomery, : who * has been
prominently iduntiiied .; with its man
agement, got his tirst "staked to prop
erly locateand prospect the- mine from
T. E. Edwards, , -who owns a large in
terest in it and has helped with a
generous hand many, of the early pros
pectors in Nevada, where he is largely
interested in mining properties.
Montgomery has never openly denied
that Edwards made it possible for him
to successfully operate the Mont
gomery-Shoshone and the story of Ed
wards' generous help to Montgomery
would probably have become a tradi
tion of - the" Western Nevada mining
camps, butsf or the fact that another
claimant to a share of whatever credit
is due* for aiding Montgomery, when
he was an ordinary \u25a0 prospector, have
suddenly come forward and are pre
paring to tie up the-mine with litiga
tion. P. E. O'Brien and JU S. Fin
negan, well known In' the* Tonopah dis
trict, are preparing an injunction suit
against Montgomery to prevent him
trom disposing of the Montgomery-
Shoshone mine on the ground thatjthey
are entitled to a three-fourths interest
in the property. They will also sue for
accounting. In their suit the plaintiffs
join with Montgomery as co-defend
ants T. E. Edwards and O. F. Riebel.

SUN FLOWER PHILOSOP^ W
TRADE AND IMMIGRATION.
IT cannot escape public attention nor pass unnoticed by the pol
iticians that the Trans-Mississippi Congress at Portland and the
Reciprocity Conference at Chicago are taking up some very po
tent and very practical public and political questions. Out of these
questions will issue the politics of the immediate future.
Commerce and immigration are brought to the front, pushed up
by the thought of the people. While the Governors of Oregon and
Washington, in addressing the Portland Congress, saw only one
fraction of the immigration question, Governor Pardee of Califor
nia brought it all into focus, and took the only tenable ground, by
insisting that all nations have equality of treatment in respect to
immigration. Any other policy is not only too narrow for the dig
nity of a great country, but it is injurious to our commerce.
It is interesting that the old issues in politics, which were sen
timental, have entirely passed away, and we are now entering the
period of economic politics. In the past we were alarmed lest the
national soul go to perdition. Now we are solicitous about the
body; how shall it be clothed and wherewith shall it be fed. It is
useless to decry this as commercialism and this as a commercial
age. "Seest thou a man diligent in his business, he shall stand
before kings and he shall not stand before mean men," was uttered
in a commercial age. Every age has been commercial. The stu
dent of politics who intends to take an active part in public affairs
must inquire into the economic conditions .that have brought men
fnto conference in Portland and Chicago.
We are not going to have any more race issue or sectional poli
tics. All that is buried with the resolutions of 1798 and 1799, the
Mississippi compromise, the Wilmot proviso and the Dred Scott
decision. We have now the politics of three meals a day and a
change of shirts. \u25a0 . , \u25a0..'

LESSON FOR LITTLE CHAIILJE.
By and by the temper of Federal jurisdiction will change. The
amicable civilian spirit will replace harsh military methods, and we
will get along better. But Senator Curtin is in no mood to wait
for a placeboic policy, and proposes to work out his old iron in
keeping the United States out of the Yosemite Valley. The case
will raise some interesting issues, which will attract the attention
of the lawyers and the laity. The Yosemite Valley and the Mari
posa Big Trees were granted by Congress to the State of California
in trust. The trust was burdened with certain conditions, which"
have been fulfilled by providing roads and trails to make the valley
and its scenery accessible, and by making provision in the valley
for the shelter of sightseers.
About the time that the trust was created a squatter problem
was planted in the valley. There had been some squatters in the
valley for some time, but their locations were not made with a view
of obstructing access. But one Mr. Hutchings understood the value
of getting in the way and he proceeded to squat clear across the
valley, on a line just below the Ompompanoosies and Union. Point.
He was a militant and persuasive person, and rebellious to author
ity. As the lord of the valley he disputed the jurisdiction of the
State Commissioners and raised a rumpus of the first class. A ready
writer and talker, he was soon the beneficiary of a widespread be
lief that he was the discoverer of the valley and was about to be
despoiled by the State. This belief spread out of the State and the
rights of Hutchings in the Yosemite Valley and the Terry-Broderick
duel shared the front of the stage as the two best known "doings"
in California.
As a matter of fact neither he nor the squatters who preceded
him had any right or title whatever. But Hutchings did not mind
that. He was a. superb lobbyist and persuaded the Legislature to
grant to him the land he occupied in the valley, subject to ratifi
cation by Congress, and he actually lobbied a ratification bill
through the House of Representatives at Washington. Next move
lie persuaded the Legislature to appropriate a large sum of money
to buy the squatter claims in the valley. Of this he received about
530.000 for his claim and as soon as the Commissioners were gone
lie reoccupied the land and defied them and the' State. Out- of this
attempt to eat his cake and keep it sprang some of the most lurid
litigation in our judicial history.
As Senator Curtin's case seems to be based on the extinguish
ment of Hutchings' title by the State, making his and the other
squatter holdings therefore the property of the State and separate
from the trust property granted to the State by the United States,
the result of this carnival of litigation bears- directly upon that which
is proposed. Hutchings claimed that his right to the land in the
valley had vested and was not affected by the grant in trust to the
State. The case went up on writ of error to the Supreme Court of the
United States, and went against Hutchings, {lie opinion of the court
being written by Mr. Justice Field. The court said that a party
by mere settlement upon lands of the. United States, with declared
intention to obtain title to the same, does not thereby acquire such
a vested interest in the premises as to deprive Congress of the
power to divest it by grant to another party. The act of Congress
of 1864 passed the title of the Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Big
Tree Grove to the State, subject to the trust specified therein, and
"this solemn trust," said the court, "is accepted by the State." A
pre-emptor of public land acquires only the preference to enter his
land when the Government puts it into the market, but the United
States is under no obligation to put the lalid in the market, and can
make other disposition of it.
This decision seems to dispose of Senator Curtin's case so far
as it rests on the squatter claims. If the State chose to make a gift
of money to Hutchings, it could do so, and it did. That act, how
ever, did not affect the legal status of the valley. As the Supreme
Court said, Congress passed the title to California, contingent upon
a specified trust. The State accepted that trust, and is just as free
to give it up as it has. When the trust is abandoned the title re
verts to the trustor. Still we hope that Senator Curtin will press
his suit, for it will advertise the valley.
rpHE transfer of tie Yosemite Valley to the United States is
' I to be obstructed by a lawsuit. Senator Curtin is bringing the
- A suit in wrath that has been roused by differences of opinion be
tween his stock herders and the soldiers who guard the Yosemite
National Park, a reservation that is entirely distinct from" the Yo
semite Valley. The valley may go into Federal or remain in State
control and the status of the park will be unchanged. Therefore
the controversy between the livestock men and the Government over
the grazing of forest and park reservations will not be composed
by a lawsuit over the jurisdiction of the Yosemite Valley.
It is probable that the troops of soldiers, acting as forest guards,
sre frequently arbitrary and offensive. In the past they have re
moved and destroyed the landmarks of private holdings, which is
a felony under the State law, and in other ways have made the
American eagle offensive in the mountains. But these evils and
errors are due largely to the fact that our forest and park policy
is not" fully formed. The people are not adjusted to it, nor is it
adjusted to the conditions which it must fit. Washington is a long
way off and the department and bureau officials there who have
charge of these mountain reservations know but little of the local
atmosphere and situation. They have an idea that the people of
California cherish designs of spoliation and must be frustrated by
force.
A YOSEMITE LAWSUIT.
I do not claim this here's a tale fer little
kids an* such.
What don't know 'bout this sinful worldâ
* that is, they don't know much;
But, oh, its longe&t. : strongest suit, is
truth I still maintain,
11' Wicked William felt remorse he never
made It plain. '
He worked that claim both, night and
day, he worked it with a gun.
Ati\ oh. he was a millionaire when that
there work v,as done;
An'â here's the fact that pained us'someâ
the parson halved t'no same,
Fer William said 'twas special grace that
led him to thaf claim.
WHEN Wicked William got remorse
for all the sins he'd did
While y shootin'/ " up the minln*
camps an' trav'lin' joy amid,
The preacher says to him, he says, "The
sinful- things you' vo done,- - ,-â
You how must testify to all." Says Wil
liam, "Where's my gun?" .
Oh, then .that noble preacher man, he
says, "This eome- annoys;
I fear you ain't got much remorse," Says
; Bill. VI know the. boys." ;, ;
An' If I've ~ got to testify to all"â he
heaved a s!ghâ v . 'â¢. -
"I reckon that there'll be no harm 'to
have my gun some nigh."
When William. rose ter speak that night
v . the boys assembled there, . v ' -
An' tirst they listened solemn to the par
son's f etchin' prayer. .'. ;
Then Willjam saysâ he stood upon a stone
beside the eriek â .
"I feel my.iost an' sinful state; you bet
it -makes me sick.
Sometimes six aces in my sleeve has
sorter casual met,
An' when I played them aces out â "jest
then thestone upset,
An' so did William in the crick. Our
laughter roso some high,
Till Rubber Rufus noticed that"\ Bill's
gun was middlln' dry.
"Oh, sinners." William then resoomedâ
. . jest then he looked around
Ao' saw the place where that there stone
. htd theretofore ben foundâ
"Oh, feller sinners, for my guilt I'm
droppin' now a tear.
An' also, I would wish to state, that now
â I locate here!" .â¢\u25a0 .
The subsekent perceedin's then I claim
was somewhat wrong; . *; â¢ "
If Bill was short on piety, his gun play
was. some long;

Members of the commission stated-yes
terday that the capacity of a tube eight
inches in diameter is 350,000 pieces of mail
an hour, as determined at a test made in
Chicago. This is greater Jthan the total
number of letters posted In a' day in all
San Francisco, so. there \ is said to. be no
danger of a tube not doing the work. -
A space twenty-eight by ninety-alx, feet
in the ferry building is asked for the \u25a0 es
tablishment of a terminal for the tube by
the commission. \u25a0\u25a0 (It?, does' ; not wish to
place the tube in the old ferry station be
.cause, of the lack" of permanency of >the
location. The ; Harbor Commissioners will
be asked for \u25a0? the | required j space jon | the
ground . floor, * and, whether the service Is
obtained rests; with them. .; : .
i New York, St. Louis, = Chicago,' - Phlladel-:

temof mail service In; operation,' and it
,has been found Tto be a success in each'of
these cities. Money,, is Tready for ; the ; re
pairing of the "systems : already^ In {use,;
but: no provision i is \made* for^-thel' in-'
stallation of, new- ones. "Congress ( wlll
be appealed to for, the; money < to install :
the San . Francisco tube. ~ ~
â¢ The distance that the maMs will, have to
be carried in wagons from > the ferry to
the new main postofflce is L 54 miles, ten
minutes' ride on street car or twenty
five minutes drive in a loaded .wagon. Su
perintendent of. Malls Ford saldi.that
there seemed to be an impression among
business men that the removal of the
ferry postoffice would cripple the service,
but that the installation of the tube ser
vice would make It even better than be
fore.
If a site can be secured in the ferry
building the San Francisco 1 public is as
sured of a pneumatic tube mail service
between the new postoftlce, Mission and
Seventh streets; Station. X, New Mont
gomery street, and the terminal for over
land malls at the ferry postofflce. , The
Pneumatic Tube Commission from Wash
ington, D. C, investigated' existing con
ditions here yesterday arid will , depart
to-day for the national capital, having
received a good impression of thia city
and its need of the quick service. The
commission's report will be given to the
Postoffice Department, and it. is said San
Francisco will soon be one of the five
cities in the United States so favored.
. The Pneumatic ' Tube Commission is
composed of J. M. Masten, F. W. Vaille
and J. H. Crew, all of Washington, D. C.
In a separate party, but acting with it
for the betterment of the service, was
the. committee on the removal of the
postofflce to Mission and. Seventh streets,
consisting of J.H. Crew, superintendent
of railway adjustment; Alexander Grant,
assistant general superintendent of rail
way mail service, and T. J. Ford, super
intendent of mails at the local postofflce.
The Washington, officials feel, that now
is the opportune time for the, installation
of the tube service for this city, because
the removal of the postofflce to Mission
street. will necessitate the carrying. of 90
per cent of, the mails entering the city
in wagons from the old ferry postofflce to
the new building.

lation is perfect, which is such an aid
to beauty at a dance.
The first floor, including the reception
rooms, reception hall and ballroom (or
auditorium) may be thrown into one
apartment, or may be divided by sliding
doors, as the club, or the* renter, may
desire.
On the second floor are the club's own
delightful apartments, which will not be
subject to. rental. \
On the third floor is the gymnasium
with its accessories, which may be rented
for club or gymnasium purposes on such
days as the California Club doesn't re
quire it. It is on this floor that the
Sketch Club has engaged headquarters,
and mighty cozy quarters they are, hav
ing been equipped to meet the require
ments of the tenants.
So clubwomejn. if you're looking about
for a new home, hurry around to the new
clubhouse, pick out your rooms and get
what yon want while the workmen are
there.
And thus has It come to pass that the
California Club has crystallized its dream.
Moreover, it has shown that fifteen club
womenâwho, presumably have trained
minesâ are not any harder on a diplo
matic architect than one woman who
thinks in kinks.
It is hoped that Dy the middle of Sep
tember the club will throw open its doors
to Its friends, and then Mr. Knowles*
achievement will speak for itselfâdiplo
matic Mr. Knowles!
Meanwhile, Mrs. Cotton and her com
mittee are receiving congratulations.

What of the architect?
Why, he's a trump, is this 'William
Knowlfs. say they, and if Anna H. Shaw
bad only known him before she set eyes
-.viion Professor Griggs I am convinced
"^ f> would have pronounced him "the
fcost perfect man in California"; for be
hold here a man who for over a year has
discussed plaus and perspectives and ele
vations and joists and braces aifd window
b<>xes with fifteen women, each of whom
\u25a0aas well equipped with ideas of her own
on the subject, end who emerges with a
tniie upon his facp, the good will of fif
teen women in his pocket and the club
2iousÂ» nearly completed, practically as
he set out to do it. Moreover, this phe
nomenal architect declaresâ and he looks
Â«.*!Â« If he means itâ that he has enjoyed
every phase of the work, and he payÂ« a
let of pretty compliments to the intelli
gence of the president and her building
committee Let all architects take no
t5 Cc for most of them find one woman's
itfe&s on architecture a-plenty.
As for the interior, it is to be finished
jn natural woods, largely redwood, with
the exception of the auditorium, or ball
room, whicÃ will bÂ« done in whita and
icold. Apropos to this apartment, it will
seat SOO. exclusive of the balcony, and
as for dancing, it has the dandiest kind
of a "spring" Hoor â this is a tip to the
dancing clubs that. have sought afar for
such a commodity. Besides, the venti-
Ever 6ince the steps have been in place
âfew clubwomen are graceful climbersâ
bunches of Ahem . have inspected the
building, and they are a unit in bowing
their acknowledgments to the cleverness
of the club's president, Mrs. Aylett R.
Cotton, and her sane building committee,
cf which Mrs. Richard I. Wbelan Is chair
man.
You will find it on the north side of
Clay street, bettvetn Van Xess avenue
and Polk street, and it is almost ready
for thÂ«* foregathering of the club,;for by
the middle of September the members
hopp to christen their fireside with appro
priate cere:nonieÃ. '.
If there's a clubhouse hereabouts that
eli<vtvs better utilization of epace, saner
lUihting and ventilation, fitter facilities
for comfort, I haven't seen it; and as for
sun, it streams intn the rooms in trop
ical fashion from three eldesâ when it
chines.
Th" California Club house Is at last a
thing: of actuality, and, incidentally, a
thing of beauty, utility and comfort.

HEART RIGHT
When He dolt Coffee.
Life Insurance Companies will not ln-
eure a man suffering 1 from heart trou-
ble. The reason is obvious.
This is a serious matter to the hus-
band or father who is solicitous for the
future of his dear ones. Often the heart
-^rouble is caused by an unexpected
fiThlngr and can be corrected If taken in
*time and properly treated. A man
Jn Colorado writes:
"I was a great coffee drinker for
many years, and was not aware of the
lnjuriojis effects of the habit till I be-
came a* practical invalid, suffering from
heart trouble, indigestion and nervous-
ness to an extent that made me wretch-
edly miserable myself and a nuisance
to those who witnessed ray sufferings.
"I continued to drink coffee, however,
not suspecting that it was the cause ot
my in health, till, on applying- for life
insurance, I was rejected on account of
the trouble with my heart. Then I be-
came alarmed. I found thariearfng off
coffee helped me quickly, so I quit ft al-
together and having been attracted by
the advertisements of Postum Food
Coffee I began its use.
"The change In my condition was re*
markable, and it was not long till I
was completely cured. All my ailments
vanished. My digestion was completely
restored, my nervousness disappeared,
and, most Important of all, my heart
steadied down and became normal, and
on a second examination I was accept-
ed by the life insurance company. Quit-
hns Coffee 'and using Postum worked
the cure," Name given by Postum Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich.

possession of the machine, but it was
refused.
About 1:30 o'clock yesterday morn-
Ing Wagar heard the "toot, toot," of
an automobile outside the garage and
opened the doors. Six chauffeurs, four
of whom he knew, made straight for
the disputed automobile and, jumping
into it, set it in. motion. Wagar and
two others interfered and they were
beaten and routed by the, six, who rode
out of the garage with the machine.
There was another machine outside and
three of them Jumped into it and the
sextet soon disappeared along the

MODEL YACHTS WILL, RACE
FOR DICKIE CH.VLLEXGK CUP
California is again to the fore with a
sensational light harness horse,' the
new wonder being Zolock, the son of
McKlnney. He won the 2:09 class pace
at Santa Rosa yesterday, his fastest
mile being 2:o7 }Â£.
After pacing two heats at Fresno,
each in 2:O5Vi. his owner was asked
to place a price on him. He did so,
naming $50,000 as the figure at which
he was willing to part with his great
horge. Were it not for the unsettled
condition of racing in the' East he
would' surely be purchased there. Zo
lock is ten years old. He is dark bay
in color, stands 15.3 hands in height
and weighs about 1200 pounds.
While he is believed to be capable of
showing two-minute speed, what en
hances his value 'is the fact that his
progeny can also show extreme speed.
Only three of them, have been handled
and. they", are all fast. Ambush, which
had a mark of 2:20 as a two-year-old,
has reduced this to 2:14%. Delilah, a
daughter, won the two-year-old pacing
division of the Paciflc'Coast Futurity
Stakes of 1904. She won at Fresno
recently in 2:14.

To-day and to-morrow are -open dates
on the programes of both the San Fran
cisco and the Corinthian yacht clubs,
The Corinthian yachts Speedwell,
Genesta and Truant, which have been
on the annual cruise up the Sacramento
River during the past week, will re
turn to-morrow to their moorings in
Tiburon Cove. On board the flagship
Speedwell are Commodore T. Jennings.
E. Howard, F. E. Schober and Charles
Gerlach. On the yawl Truant are ex-
Commodore John W. Pew, Charles Bar
rett and J. Stack. On the sloop Genesta
are Vice Commodore J. C. Brickell,
Charles Morrell, H. Dimond, J. Donni
gan and J. O'Brien.
It. ls high water at 2:39 p.m. to-day
at Fort Point. To-morrow It is low
water at 8:22 a. m. at Fort Point and
high water at 3:08 p .m \u0084 so that it will
be easy to reach any point on the up
per bay. A return to moorings, though
it may be somewhat late if the wind
drops, Is assured, as the' tide runs out
till 9:08 p. m. to-morrow night.
Commodore W. G. Morrow of the San
Francisco Yacht Club returned on Tues
day from a trip to Southern California.
In his absence the flagship Challenger
remained at her moorings last Sunday
and the flagship for the day was Vice
Commodore J. M. Punnett's sloop Cur
lew. As neither the Curlew nor Port
Captain T. Kennedy' 3 yawl Witch
reached the Petaluma drawbridge last
Saturday night, the fleet was unaccom
panied by any flag officer.
N. H. Neustadter of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, who chartered the
sloop Amlgo from J. S. Mattoon of the
Corinthian Yacht Club, has bought the
fast boat, which will now be enrolled
permanently in the Sausallto fleet.
Next Saturday, the 26th inst,, the
fleet of the San Francisco Yacht Club
will cruise up to Vallejo and on the
27th will hold a handicap race 'down
to Sausalito. In these races the regatta
committee allots such handicaps as the
previous performances of the. boats in
dicate, and though these races have 'a
considerable element of luck about
them in the "matter of picking up fa
vorable breezes, they always excite con
siderable interest and competition. Dr.
T. L. Hill's sloop Queen, Maino and
Boland's sloop' Minnetonka, Marteland
Blair's sloop Surprise are on, the beach
at South Sausalito, where they will re
ceive a scraping and cleaning, with a
view to making their best speed in the
handicap race. *'.'\u25a0"
The yawl Tramontana, chartered for
the season by Roy, C Ward and Harry,
S. Bridge, was back at her 'Sausalito

The members of the Automobile Club
of Southern California recently held a
run from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara,
which' was (bo successful that they now
want to have a trip to San Francisco.
They hope to interest the San Fran
cisco dealers In the plan. The run
will be arranged to take four days:
first day from Los Angeles to San
ta Barbara;, second day, from Santa
Barbara to San Luis Obispo; third day,
from San Luis Obispo to Salinas; fourth
from Salinas to San Francisco. The
shortest day's run being 110 miles and
the longest 148 miles, an average of about
126 miles per day would have to be cov
ered.,, '*;>.;\u25a0 k''-~-':'
Therevare no signs of a meet at Del
Monte under the management of the
Automobile Club of California, but \he
executive committee of the club has
its sanction for three races to be held
at the automobile,' cycle and motor-cycle
tournament on the Ingleside track on
Sunday, September 3. There will be
a one-mile event free for all, a three
mile race for stock cars costing not more
than 51500 and a', five-mile contest for
stock cars costing" not more than $3500.
It was intended to bring Earl Klser, the
famous racer, . to . the . meet,
but his recent almost fatal accident will
preclude his coming. An effort is being
made to engage Eddie Bald, the old bicy
cle, champion, who has been doing some
fast work in his automobile on circular
tracks lately. Bald is believed to be de
sirous to come to San Francisco and, if
he does so, will bring with him his
Columbia car, of 30-35 horsepower, which
he has driven In all the track and hill
climbing events in which he has taken
part. In this car he recently, made a
world's record for five miles in a stock
touring machine. ;
The members of the San Francisco
Motor-cycle Club will take part In sev
eral events held under the sanction of the
Federation of American Motor-cyclists.
Last fall there was for some time much
talk of an endurance run fron San Fran
cisco to Los Angeles and back, or from
L"6s \u25a0 Angeles to this city and return, to
be undertaken jointly' by. the automobile
clubs of California and Southern Cali
fornia. L. P. Lowe, chairman of the
executive committee of the. Automobile
Club of California, took a trial trip from
this city to the southern metropolis in
his White car, making careful and min
ute observations of the condition of the
road surfaces, the grades and other mat
ters of interest to motorists. On his re
turn he prepared an exhaustive report.
It did not, however, prove possible to
interest enough owners or sellers of
automobiles to make it worth while to
hold the event.
RIVER CRUISE
ENDS TO-DAY
AUTOS PLAN
THREE EVENTS
The annual coast championship tourna
ments will commence on the Hotel Ra
fael courts on September 2. Play will
continue to the afternoon of the 9th. Now
that the presence of Champion May Sut
ton and numerous other .clever players
from Southern California is assured, the
coming events are attracting the atten
tion of every follower of the game on the
coast and of many who have never seen
a tennis match, while Miss Sutton will
prove the center of attraction.
The enthusiasts in this part of the
State figure the presence of ex-Champion
Bell will make the men's events even
more Interesting than the women's.
Tho contingent from this city will pin
its' faith to Fred Adams, the clever young:
player who has" come to the front with
a rush. Adams is undoubtedly the
strongest player here and has a chance
of beating Bell. Many of Adams' admir
ers at the park figure he could beat
Champion MacGavin's game of last year.
Adams, who early in the year was a third
class player, has surely oroken all rec
ords for rapid ascensions, but it is doubt
ful if he classes with men like Mac-
Gavin as yet. If he beats Bell in the
coming tournament he will have estab
lished his right to rank with the best
players in the country. If Adams im
proves in the next year as he has in the
last few months he should outclass any
player on the coast. His forehand drive
is similar to May Sutton's, but it is even
more effective. As yet Adams has not
quite the control shown by Miss Sutton,
but he more than makes up for it in
speed. His back-hand is rather weak and
his volleying a little uncertain. Other
wise he plays almost a perfect game.
His service, drive, lob and smash are
all first class. It will be a great match
when he and Bell come together, as they
are almost sure to do.
On the park courts play will be re
sumed in the second and third classes.
In the former but one match remains to
be played. In it Darius Hotchkiss will be
opposed to Fritz Guerin. Hotchklss is a
pronounced favorite, as he has had con
siderable more experience - than his op
ponent, who but recently graduated from
the tnird class.
In the third class five matches will be
played. Martin will play the winner of
the Hall-Miller match in the semi-finals.
The other semi-rinal match will be be
tween Kahn and the winner- of the Getz-
Guerln match.
The following players have already en
tered, the i.umbtr after each name signi
fying- the probable classification:
Herbert lajiie Â»1). C. G. Kufhn <3). Henry
Mills <:>), Dr. Lovegrove Oi). Major l>ucat (.4),
Melvilu- Long <-'). A. E. Beyfuss (2). A. E.
Black (3). Albert Kenyon O. H. E. Punnett
(3). W. <I. Knowlton 13). B. K. Nourse (2).
Harry Ko!!e (1). HerH-rt Schmidt (1), Carl
Gardner Â»1). tieorge Janps (1), Ray Cornell
il). Dr. Xnble <4). GfoiÃe Busch (1), P. V.
White ii). G: G. Browne t4).
Many of the tracks have returned to
town and the most Interesting competi
tion held on the club coutts In several
months is anticipated.
Both the California Tennis Club courts
and the park courts will be occupied to
morrow with tournament play. The club
members will meet in a class singles
tournament, while the public court play
ers will complete the three-class -singles
event which was commenced last Sunday.
The California Club event is attracting
unusual attention and the entry list â
which contains more than twenty names
âwill undoubtedly be a record-breaker.
Tho first-class cup is held by ~ Herbert
Long, the third-class cup by Moulten
Warner, and .the fourth by Ed Bacon.
Nourt-e was the only entrant in the sec
ond-class ar.d should have been given the
cup. This class will be larger to-morrow,
but if there is only one player in it he
will receive the trophy.
The executive committee of the asso
ciation for the northern group of clubs
consists of Mrs. R. Gilman Brown, Mrs.
\Y. G. Miller and Miss Edith Chesebrough
of San Francisco; Mrs. P. E. Bowles and
Mrs. H. H. Sherwood of the Claremont
Country Club; Mrs. W. George of Sacra
mento and Mrs. Le Roy Nickel of Menlo
Park. The executive committee for the
southc-rn group is made up of Miss Ada
N. Smith and Mrs. A. Reynolds of San
Diego; Mrs. C. M. Shannon, Mrs. Edward
D. Silent and Mrs. W. T. Bishop of Los
Angeles; Mrs. b\ W. Seymour of Redondo
and Mrs. E. S. Hunter of Pasadena.
The executive committee of the south
ern division of clubs will, select eight
ladies, who will meet the same number
selected by the northern committee In a
team match, to be played on the course
of the San Francisco Golf and Country
Club during the tournament to be held
November 16 to IS. The championship of
the association will be decided at the
meet, the winner receiving the gold medal
and the runner-up the silver medal of the
association. Mixed foursomes will also
be played under the management of Mrs.
R Gilman Brown, the secretary-treasurer
of the California Women Golfers' Associa
tion.
Work is also being done light along
oil the new course and club-house ot
the San Francisco Golf and Country
Club near Lake Merced. Some of the
holes may be played now, but others are
not yet ready tor play, it will probably
be near the end of September before the
houhewarming ot the ingleside Club
quarters and the opining tournament are
held. Meanwhile the members of the
San Francisco (Joif and Country Ciub
have been invited to make use of the
club-house and course oi yie Claremont
Country Club.
The Ciilifo.nia Women Golfers' Asso
ciation, which held its fourth handicap
tournament on the Jinks of the Unda
Vista <Joif Club on Wednesday, has been
greatly helped in its work in the south
ern part of the Jitate by some of the
men members of the Jxjs Angeles Coun
try Club, who have shown much interest
in the woik of Mrs. C. M. Shannon, the
ass-istant secretary of the association.
M"rt. Shannon has worked hard for the
association and has won tne goodwill
of so many of the well-known ladies of
Lios Angeles that It is probable all the
golf clubs of Southern California will
join The association. It Is likely the
October tournament of the association
for the southern division will be held on
the links of the San Gabriel Golf Club,
which has recently become a member of
the association and is said to have the
prettiest course in Southern California.
New members arc being enrolled in the
Presidio Golf ClÃb and trie work of fur
nishing the dub-house and putting the
grounds surrounding it in order is pro
trcssiiig. About the middle, of Septem
ber, if the club-house and course are in
suitable condition, a formal opening of
the club quarters and an initial tourna
ment wjII be hold.
Affairs will be quiet among the golfers
of San Francisco until the fcurth of
September, on which day the annual goU
tournament at Del Monte begins, ihe
scheduled competitions will be completed
on the afternoon of the 9th, unless a
tie or ties should remain to be played
off later.

. Pitcher Brown applied the kalsomlne
brush' to; the -Oakland bunch in a .vigor
ous mariner at Recreation Park yesterday,
making 'Rip's men appear as though they
were just; learning the. -national' pastime.
Four/ hits distributed " during., the same"
'number, ' of innings failed- to s register a
count In. the run column for the Com
-m'uters.' j -Iberg was jno snap to -hit; but
he was a Carnegie when it. came, to issu
ing free passes. Eight men paraded to
the Initial sack by the free route." When:
the Tigers' did find. him for a hit it was
usually after a pass had been Issued.
Score, Tacoma 3; Oakland; 0.
The doings started .in the first round
for the Northerners. - With the assistance
of a pass and a hit and a wild throw
to second, Sheehan was allowed to make
the first tally."", \u0084 ,' â¢ '
Two sensational doubles were executed
In the third and ; fourth by both teams
that broke up -the quietness that existed.
Oakland passed the game up in the
seventh, Iberg was still having trouble
in locating the rubber. He walked Gra
ham, the first man up. He was sent along
one by Hogan's sacrifice. Brown singled
through the- pitcher's box and Graham
arrived at' the pan simultaneously with
the ball. It hit , him and caromed oft
into the fence.- Nordyke drove the ball
Into the left field and Dunleavy in trying
to make a circus catch dropped .what
should have beeji an easy out.
The run getting stopped right here.
Tacoma did. not need any and Oakland
could not' make any. The nearest they
came to it was in the final round when
Van Hal tern opened the Inning with a
sizzler aloflg; the third base line, which
went for. two bases. Francks tried to bunt
safely, but the .best, his effort was good
for was to send Van to "the' third station.
j It seemed'.Oakland'wduldjpreverit a shut
out, but neither Dunleavy nor Kruger
could get even a? long fly and stop a
shutout. Two easy "outs and their cap
tain was r left resting at the third- station,
which' was'; the .farthest. any man :on the
Oakland ; team went ! during the contest.

BUFFALO. N. V.. Aug. 18.â "Webb Jay
of Cleveland was probably fatally in
jured at Kenilworth Park to-day in the
ten-mile automobile race. At the three
quarters of the fourth mile Jay"s ma
chine crashed through the fence, down
an embankment of fifteen feet and into
a pond of water. What caused the ac
cident is not known. It is believed,
however, that Jay was blinded by dust
and steered into the fence. He was
driving about a mile a minute when
the accident happened.
Jay was racing with Lytle and Bur
man. At the three-quarters turn Jay
was third and the dust cloud of the
other two cars hung over him.
at the three-quarters the track was
banked with earth taken from the ex
cavation which had left a deep hole
just beyond the fence. Heavy rains
had transferred the hole into a deep
pond. Just as Jay refunded the turn
Ms car crashed through the fence,
down the fifteen-foot embankment and
into the water. Ja.y, unconscious, would
have drowned had not two spectators
fitting on the fence near by gone to his
rescue and dragged him out. He was
taken to the German Hospital, where
it was found nine ribs were broken,
one of his lungs was punctured and
his right femur was fractured. \u25a0' Pneu
monia and pleurisy, it is believed, will
set in within twenty-four hours. 'If
he survives them he may live, the Sur
geons say. . ;

BUFFALO, Aug. 18.â There were some
large doings in the way of winning long
shots in the racing. The ' victory of
Maraschino in the sixth race cost the
books a pretty penny. Chatelaine and
Devonshire were the â¢ betting choices in
this event, but a heavy play on Maras
chino caused his price to dwindle down
from 20 to 1 to 6 to 1. Maraschino del
hvered the goods by half a length with
Chatelaine second and Devonshire third.
It was determined by the management
of the Fort Erie track to-day to extend
the meeting at least ten days longer than
originally intended. It was intended to
close here on the. 31st lnst. Summary:

Jimmy Britt's' dream of adding $10,000 of Battling Nelson's coin, to his
collection of double eagles has vanished into thin air. The.sideVbet has.not
been made, as proposed when the articles were signed, and will not ,be
unless some sporting man comes to the rescue of the Dane. .. v;/^ . \u0084_,'
No one would do this until the referee was selected, as -while the ' :
fight may, as Britt' says, "referee itself," the fact 'remains that that' official,
will play an important pa.rt in its decision.. Thereare two styles .of; fight- .=
Ing to be reconciled,' and whichever way the referee leans will' haveCan 1
important bearing on the outcome of the contest.
It was thought if any one weakened on, the proposition of: the side
bet it*would be Britt. but the Californian came forward yesterday , and
stated he was ready to post the money at once in the hands of Stake
holder Harry Corbett. < .
Nelson has also, refused to post half of* the $20,000 guaranteed Jimmy
Britt, Nolan's offer to do which was one .of the dramatic 'incidents at. the ;
signing of the articles. It was known at the time that Manager Coffroth,
did not hesitate to give the guarantee. for .business reason*. â¢ Having once \u25a0
! refused to do so, however, he would not give in to Willie Britt,' the rnan-^
j aging brother* . | \u0084:\u25a0â\u25a0:' '\u25a0'.\u25a0\u25a0 .. \u25a0 - ' \u25a0
I Bout Becomes Business Proposition. ; \u25a0 ;;Jâ¢ " . .
With the side bet eliminated and the novel feature of.one fighter mak-'
ing a guarantee as to what the other's share, would be removed, all the
glamour thrown about the signing of . the articles "vanishes, and : brings jthe^;
bout down to a commonplace business proposition. v The-'last'props of the.
superstructure will fall should it develop that the winner-take-all clause ,
in the articles is canceled in another agreement. , : \u25a0 ; ; ', '\u0084
: If the general committee having: in charge; the Native Sons', celebration ;
at Sacramento can present to Manager Jim Coffroth to-night a permit for
a 45-round fight to take place in this city in September the fight, will be '
held here. It is believed to be a physical impossibility to seenre-theneces- \u0084
sary signatures of. ten Supervisors,; so it Feems an assured fact that the
fight will be held at Colma on Admissidn' day -as originally planned. â¢.â¢ l
The special committee from the; Native Sons,, headed by Grand Presi-*
dent James X Gallagher, waited on the' Mayor \u25a0' yesterday in- his' private
office to enlist his aid in securing a change in the date of, the fight. Man- '
aged Jim Coffroth was also present. â¢;\u25a0 Â».; <;: â¢ f .-?Z' r ,'\u25a0 â¢ ! <
Mr. Gallagher said It was desired to change the date of thereon test.*
because it would conflict with the Native Son 3' celebration of Admission
day in Sacramento. ; . â¢ ;\u25a0; â¢ \u0084â¢â¢.. '.- '...--, ;.."/. .) s
Mayor Agrees to Sign the Permit.
The Mayor suggested that permission be secured from the Supervisors to
hold the contest In this city, and if the resolution to that effect were passed
he would affix bis signature thereto. I
Manager Coffroth would not consent to the proposition at first, saying he
would have .to consult the principals In the proposed contest, although he him
self had <no objection to bringing off the bout in this city in the event the
permit for It could be obtained. It was stated that the fight at Colma was
scheduled to go : forty-five rounds and that the fights In this city had hitherto
been limited: to twenty rounds. The Mayor said he would agree to only a
twenty-round contest if held in this city. ' ;
Coffroth said the same general law providing for a limited contest gov
erned San Francisco as well as Colma and a contest of forty-five rounds could
be legally brought off in this city. Coffroth said it was simply a custom
instituted toy the Board of Supervisors to limit the boxing contests to twenty
rounds. At this the Mayor stated he had no more to say. It was finally
agreed that the Native 'Sons should endeavor to get the signatures of ten
Supervisors to a petition to hold the fight in this city, and if they are suc
cessful the Mayor promised to sign the permit.
Supervisors May Refuse to Act.
Opinion seems divided as to whether it Is possible to secure the neces
sary signatures of ten Supervisors. It seems certain that it will be impos
sible to secure some of the Democratic Supervisors, who are opposed to Man
ager Coffroth for political reasons. This opposition may be set aside, but
it is hardly probable. The votes which might be obtained include those of
Supervisors Boxton, Gallagher, Lunstedt, Rea, Sanderson, Alpers, Bent,
Hocks. Rock and McClellan, making the ten required. It would probably be.
more difficult to induce Booth, Brandenstein, Braunhart, Comte, Conner,
D'Ancona, Eggers and Payot to sign any petition in which Coffroth is in
terested unless the Native Sons lend their persuasive powers' in the ef
fort, to- move the Supervisors named. The fact that iriost of the Supervisors
are away on vacations adds to the difficulty of securing the needed votes..
Manager Coffroth has decided upon the site of the arena if the fight is' held
at Colma. It will be in Union Coursing Park, on the north line of School street
midway between the Mission road and thf: Southern Pacific Railway. Accommo
dations will be prepared for 12,000 spectators. .
As Jimmy Britt's trunk was not delivered at Sheehan's yesterday he did no
work there, but put in the afternoon in the Olympic Club handball court. In the
evening he went to the theater and then repaired to Sheehan's.
Nelson spent the day in town.

"Business failures in the United
States for the week ending August 17
number 147. against 156 last week, 203
In tbo like week of 1904. 166 in 1903.
ISI in 1902 and 131 in 1901.
"In Canada failures numbered 29, as
against 32 last week and 15 in this
week a year ago.
"Wheat. Including flour, exports for
the week ending August 17 were 1,088.
619 bushels, against 865.002 last week.
1.703.047 this week last year. 5.372.753

"On the Pacific Coast business is fair
ly active at all points. Railway opera
tions, swelled by large crop and indus
trial movement, are of very, full vol
urr.e.
"Iron and steel trade advices are. ff
anything., rather more encouraging.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
"Fall trade, while not yet under full
headway, Is steadily gathering force.
Buyers are more numerous. Good
weather for harvesting and thrashing,
except in portions of the Northwest,
continue to reveal very favorable re
sults in both spring and winter sown
grains. Combined cereal yields will
probably exceed all past years in
both quality and quantity. Collection*
on the whole have improved slightly.
Currency shipments to tho country ara
increaslr.gr, but no particular effect on
money rates as yet.
"Features tht3 week on Western mar
kets have been numerous, excursions of
buyers arriving at Kansas City. St.
Louis and Chicago.
Reports from clearing-houses at thÂ«
principal cities for the last week in
dicate a larger volurr:* of business than
in the week preceding and far exceed
the corresponding week in any previous
year. Total bank exchanges at the*
fourteen leading cities were 12,217,233,
310, an increase of 23.8 per cent over
the same week in 1904. and a gain
of 28.1 per cent compared with thÂ«
clearings two years ago.
Commercial failures this week In thÂ«
United States arc 218. against 222 last
week. 232 the preceding week and 22Â«
the corresponding week last year. Fail
ures in Canada number 28. against 19
last^week. 26 the preceding week and
24 last year.
NEW TGRK. Augr. 18.â Dispatches to
Dun's Review indicate that trade and
industry have made favorable progress
under thÂ« beneficent Influences or
brighter crop prospects. Boston report*
a CroK-lnjr confidence that rcakes thÂ«

LOCAL MAKKETS.
NEW YORK, Aug. IS. â Precautionary
measures to preserve profits in the shape of
sailing to re&iize overbore the new buying de
mand to-day and gave Uie stock market a
day of reactionary tone as a whole. Some
qutsiion as to .tht possible effect of the out
ccunt uf thfc peace oonlereÂ«cÂ« ax Portsmouth
and tht large Inroads of the week of the cash
reserves of the banks emphasized the disposi
tion to reduce commitments. The market con
tinued to chow a firm undertone, which was
manifested by the progressive dullnetw of the
trading a* priaea declined. The seiling, in
fact, wat not "pursued aggressively and the
market had frequent p^itxis of recovery. It
liad it* .points of positive strength as well,
although these were few in number and with
out the prevailing effect that has been seen
on previous days of the week. The pushing
up of a. ' few stocks was rather obviously for
the purpose of sustaining the rest of the
market during the process of profit taking.
The perception of this fact diminished the ef
fect of the advances. St. Paul was the con
fc;>icuous instanc* of early strength and it was
made to open at a wide advance over last
r.ifht, while active selling began almost imme
diately at all other points in the list. Late in
the day an enormous accumulation of Pennsyl
vania set in and this eerved to hold the level
Of prices for a time at otfcÂ«r points. Reading
r'.sj went to a new high level \u25a0 during the
day. This about oxhau-ited the list of strong
stocks among the active market leader*. Oth
Â«-rwise the pressure to sell was quite general,
but was most marked in the latest speculative
favorites. The Pacifies were especially affect
ed, so much so as to give rise to a rumor of
sn intention to issue additional Southern Pa
fpifle bondf to account for the weakness. This
\u25a0Â«tW.:nor was without official sanction. The re
f^'w-al of the dispute over freight rates between
the coast and g-y^f llr.es was a disturbing fac
tor upon sentiment, and the outbreak of yellow
ff-ver at new points in the South also was
diflikM. The FUFtalning firmness of Japanese
anfl Russian Government securities kept up
th<Â» belief In financial circles In an ultimate
p er^oment on a peace treaty at Portsmouth.
But the almost hopeleFS tone of much of the
r.f-ws reports and of the diplomatic utterances
from that point were not without their ln
r.uence on nÂ«-nt!ment. The poewiblllty of the
fr.flure of the conference had its part in In
ducing profit taking sales. But the prelim
inary estimates of the currency movement for
tVi wwfc. Indicating a lr*s to thÂ» Interior of
TTm*iYt\ng over J4.000.000. was the predomi
nant Influence on the market, especially as the
iÂ»u*>- treasury ha* absorbed from the banks in
Rrtflltion eorae f1.f47.00n. Part of the latter
itPin in due to payment of drafts by Interior
bs.nki> on the-lr N>w York correspondents for
the payment of -internal revenue collections,
and represents lnfl!rÂ«Â»ctly the RTOwin* r*TUlre-
Tner.t of the Interior for funds. With the
enormeme crop* in proÂ«r*ct and the irreat
business p.etlvity of the interior this require
ment rrav be * \u25a0%r- f - 1 '' Â«"1 to expand from this
time forward. While tbe market showed re

CHICAGO Aug. 18. â An early Indication
of weakness in Northwestern markets was re
flected here by an initial decline In September
wheat of %@%c to %@-%c at 82% c to 82i4c.
A period of selling at the outset forced the
near option still further down the scale. Rains
in the spring wheat districts having seeming
ly been responsible for the recent advance, iv
cessation ' was the signal for return of bear
ish sentiment. Traders who had been led into
buying by "former conditions proceeded to li
quidate their holdings. Prospect of heavier re
ceipts in the Southwest likewise exerted an in
fluence - '.toward lower prices. September de
clind to 81 Vie and. although some short lines
were covered at that figure, the market ac
quired no buoyancy. The close was with
September a shade above the low point at 81%
@Â«l%c. a loss of 1%0.-*-- -i..- -.--â¢*-.-
In - corn initial prices were easier. The
taidng on of aMarge-line of old crop Septem
ber delivery brought about a mild reversal of
sentiment and advanced all deliveries. Sep
tember, now, which was down %c to %c at the
opening, at f.2 % @ 52 %c, gained an even cent
over ths opening, but reacted . and . closed
steady. %c hlfcher at 63% c. -
Scattered selling by . commission houses
caused a shade of a loss in oats. , - September
closed steady, unchanged at 2Â«c. .
Provisions were steady, although prices suf
fered to some extent from realizing, sales by
local holders. September pork closed down
17y.c, lard is * down 5c and ribs made a net
loss" of 2%c / ' ' '. â

The report of Edward A. li.als. section di
rector of the United Btatea Weather Bureau,
lor Uie Oregon Crop Bulletin, week ended
August 15, is as follows:
Dry weather continues and the need of rain
is becoming more urgent. Streams are getting
lew and pasturage is becoming very short, ex
cfpt on tide lands and on the mountain ranges.
Ftock up to within a few days ago kept in
good condition, but now cattle arÂ« losing fte&h
Â«xc*pt whÂ«re they are helped by an extra
leed *Â»f hay. The harvesting and the thresh
ing of grain axe being rapidly pushed and fomÂ«
farmers are through with this work. FaJl
â¢wheat and barley yields continue good. Tne
Â«tr&w of spring wheat was heavy and the
htads were "large, but the berry shriveled dur
ing the recent hot weather, with the result that
the yields in nearly every section of the- State
are ',e*p than expected. Oats suffered sim
ilarly and, while the damage was possibly not
*o great as In the case of spring wheat, oat
yields are also disappointing.
Corn and late potatoes need rain; thÂ« hct
days curl the corn leaves, but they freshen up

confessed that 'he It ; was ; who â¢ smote the

their description of the manner in which
the defendant had tortured a horse that
hÂ« was given the alternative of paying a
$150 fine or serving 150 days in Jail.

was to the effect that no ; excessive or un
necessary punishment â¢ was -administered
to the horse, it being a young animal, and
the defendant's effort being 'to break it
to harness with an. older animal. .
His Honor, not only commended the la
dies for their conduct, but sharply re
buked, Mr. Sehabiague in addition to sen
tencing him.
After pleading guilty to the "charge of
having broken a window in the seed' store
of Trumbull fcCo., on Sansoine'. Btreet,
W. T. Clark sank into a chair, upon the
seat of which Patrolman D. TA. Sullivan
had Just placed his new derby hat.'As
sisted by the owner of the. crushed head
gear, Mr. Clark abruptly stood up again.
"But the smashing of the glass was not
intentional," he explained to. Police ' Judge
Fritz, "nor was it I that actually broke
It. While aiming a, blow at my fellow
defendant here, Mr. Keenah,} my foot
slipped and my fist . collided | with j the
h7ad of my lady companion, whose name*
it is unnecessary to disclose, and she fell
against the pane, shattering It."'
Lanky of frame and lugubrious of coun
tenance was Mr. Clark, in wide physical
contrast to his "lady companion," who
stood beside him as he pleaded.' She was
buxom of form and jolly of facer arid her
coiffure suggested combed. flax.
"But why did you try' to strike Mr.
Keenan?" the Judge Inquired.
"Because," Mr. Clark replied, "he buried
In while I was 'escorting this lady from
her place of employment, a Paclflo 'street
dance hall, to her home. It may not be
amiss for me ' to state that while I have
been endeavoring to lead her to a higher
life he has put forth effort to keep her
flownâ aye, to drag her to even a lower
social and moral plane than she now oc
cupies." Â» > .
"That's right, Judge," cheerfully chimed
in Miss Anonym. "Will has just been
a-breaklng'hls neck to reform me, while
Joe hasn't do*ne a thing but hold me
down, as Will 6ays."
Then her. wandering eye caught a
glimpse -of Patrolman Sullivan ruefully
poking the dents out of his hat, and she
Jellied with Bilent mirth. \u25a0
; Mr. \u25a0 Clark agreed to, t pay $5 for the
broken window, and; both he and Mr.
Keenan were 'dismissed. . Miss Nameless
held a handkerchief to her mouth as she
left the court, but ' twinkling ; eyes and
shaking sides betrayed the intense' hilar
ity \u25a0 that possessed her.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Tho conference of city officials held
yesterday in the Mayor* office to con
sider proposed revised plans for the re
construction of the Geary street road by
the city brought to light the fact that
the company now operating the road,
whose franchise has expired, - will not
permit the city to confiscate the roadbed
without taking steps to prevent it. The
discussion developed that the company
claimed to own the rails and roadbed.
A. D. -Shepard, vice president of the
road, said ' the Geary-street railroad
stockholders do not relinquish any of
their legal rights to any property in
wtych they are Interested and will take
steps to preserve their rights. E. P.
Troy stated that Horace G. natt, presi
dent of the road, had, formally relinquish
ed all claims to the roadbed and other
property, which was a consideration for
permitting the operation' of the road after
the franchise had expired. Shepard said
the only consideration as a return for
the operation of the road was the agree
ment of the company to pay to^the city
5 per cent of the gross receipts, which
he regarded as a license for operating the
road. Troy held that 'tne company could
not gain any rights, except as the charter
provides, and the contention of the com
pany that it had secured any permanent
privilege is frivolous, as no resolution to
that effect had ever been adopted .by the
board.
Engineer Stut, who prepared the plans,
stated that it would be cheaper to use
the old rails for 6even years and then
replace them with grooved rails. The
cars could be eight feet wide and of
modern construction. Stut said the road
bed is in fine condition and it would cost
a great deal to tear it out as it Is as
solid as a rock.
Supervisor Connor thought it would be
well for the company to take up Its
rails, so the city could put down grooved
rails at once. Stut eaid tnat if he had to
prepare the plans again he would not
change them, as under them the road
would be a paying \u25a0 proposition with a
comparatively small outlay. The Mayor
read a list of objections prepared by an
engineer, who holds that the space be
tween the two inner rails is too narrow,
which would necessitate the relaying of
the tracks.
Troy said if the dirt was not flying, be
fore the next i.ovember election 15,000
people who had voted for municipal
ownership would hold the Mayor respon
sible. The Mayor said he would accept
the responsibility , but no body of men
would influence his decision to insure a
modern system.
Troy wanted to pin the Mayor down
as to whether he would refuse to ap
prove the contract or block construction
work, but the Mayor rerused to state his
Intention, merely stating that the Super
visors would be responsible for any de
fects.
Connor said the city would' certainly
build the road and the grooved rail would
Increase the cost by 1125,000. City Engin
eer Woodward suggested that the issue
with the Geary street company be met
now and work proceed at once under the
old plans, unless the Supervisors would
consent to changing them, which does not
seem probable. Judging from their public
utterances.
Stut will be engaged at once by the
Board of Works to prepare the plans.
"Ay ban tak yust - yon drank," . eald
Peter M. , Johnson, accused by Patrolman
Nelson of having * been intoxicated jat
midday on the Barbary Coast. "Ay ban

playing to Judge Fritz his shoes, whlsh
were sliced . and carved in a . most ex
traordinary way. \u25a0"_ \u25a0 . . \u25a0
Then the story came out. Mr. Johnson
had informed some of his cellmates in the
City Jail that after his consumption qf
one drink of "whisky, he was crossing
Kearny street; and a wagon wheel ran
over one of his feet, but Just. which foot
it wag' he could not remember. To aid
him. in obtaining clearness* of \u25a0 mind on
that point one of; the prisoners, who .had
managed to conceal a pocketknife from
the searchers, kindly removed .the shoes
with having previously burglarized a
shooting gallery at 531 Pacific street and
helped themselves to the alleged cigars
which are awarded as prizes to those
marksmen who score a certain number of
bullseyes. Judge Conlan has started j in
quiry,: to ascertain how | the j defendants
managed to smoke the proceeds of their
burglary and retain' the vitality essential
to the plundering of an apple cart.

A. Shaw and H. Drlocoll, who came
up from San Jose do Guatemala on the
liner City of Sydney, which arrived
yesterday, were objects of ' great in
terest to their fellow passenger*. At
San Jose, the . ship's officers were in
formed that the two men had been In
the pay of President Cabrera, who had
hired them to assassinate General
Manuel Barillas, the. former President
of the republic and the head of the
anti-Cabrera party.
Shaw and Drlscoll are Australians.
They served with the British forces in
South Africa. "And we *aye a bit of
reputation," volunteered Drlscoll.
They were engaged, they said yester
day, in New Orleans by secret agents of
President Cabrera. They were given
to understand that Cabrera . wanted a
few adventurous men who would .'do as
they were told without asking too
many questions. >\ .
' "I 'avesome principles," said Drls
coll, "but wot's principles w'en the pay's
proper."
They decline to say Just what they
were engaged to do.
"Some of ' our . mates Is still there
arid it" might, go *ard with them If we
was too bloomin' chatty."
At Guatemala* City they found a num
ber^of men of .their own kind. They
say .that Cabrera? made the.cltisens of
the ' republic believe .'that -his reserve
force was much stronger, than it really
numbered. S .Their services, they say,
were not required.- \ Their pay,- smaller
than promised. by the man in New Or
leans, was handed to them ' regularly
and In addition work was found for
them on the railroad.. Hl-health,'they
say, compelled them' to leave the coun
